00:00:00,583 --> 00:00:03,583
(crickets chirping)

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,877
(train clattering)

3
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:20,591
(car zooming)

4
00:00:40,027 --> 00:00:43,027
(car door slamming)

5
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:48,841
(car door slamming)

6
00:01:13,294 --> 00:01:16,211
(car horn blaring)

7
00:01:20,477 --> 00:01:21,310
(car door slamming)

8
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,393
(car engine revving)

9
00:01:35,874 --> 00:01:37,060
(car door slamming)

10
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,560
(woman breathing heavily)

11
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:51,694
(train clattering)

12
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,482
(seat belt clicking)

13
00:02:06,482 --> 00:02:07,703
(baby whining)

14
00:02:07,703 --> 00:02:10,518
(car door slamming)

15
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:14,317
(car door slamming)

16
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:16,817
(baby crying)

17
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:30,545
(woman shushing)

18
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:37,208
(baby continues crying)

19
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:56,002
(church bell rings four times)

20
00:03:04,111 --> 00:03:07,861
(church bell rings 10 times)

21
00:03:23,524 --> 00:03:26,441
(train clattering)

22
00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:48,488
(door closing)

23
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,129
(frying pan sizzling)
- 54 with some showers

24
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,931
and thunderstorms likely.

25
00:04:05,931 --> 00:04:08,314
Then for the weekend a high of only 56

26
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,202
as we head in for stormy weather.

27
00:04:10,202 --> 00:04:13,381
I'm Alan Stoff, for
Wake Up Chicago weather.

28
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:14,943
- [TV Traffic Reporter] And now let's have

29
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:16,854
one last check of traffic with--

30
00:04:16,854 --> 00:04:18,403
(liquid pouring drowns out speaker)

31
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:19,686
- Thanks--
(carafe drowns out speaker)

32
00:04:19,686 --> 00:04:21,038
Right now we're seeing an accident

33
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:22,490
on the southbound Tristate

34
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,280
just south of 68th and 70 Road.

35
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,085
We have one lane blocked at the corner

36
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:31,085
so we're seeing some
slight delays in that area.

37
00:04:39,286 --> 00:04:41,369
- Good morning.
- Morning.

38
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,663
What?

39
00:04:45,663 --> 00:04:48,167
- You were watching Wake
Up Chicago, weren't you?

40
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:49,140
- Oh, I didn't notice.

41
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,923
I just turned the TV on.

42
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,339
- [Carrie] Mmhmm.

43
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:54,810
- What's the matter?

44
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,480
- Well it appears my wife
is a morning news adulterer.

45
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,810
- I'm not, it's just the forecast

46
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,090
is more accurate on Channel 14.

47
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,690
- So I guess a little
solidarity is too much to ask?

48
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,300
- It's just the weather.
- Yeah.

49
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,310
Well keep in mind, my ratings
determine my marketability.

50
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,750
And if I can't draw the locals,

51
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,650
how am I supposed to lure the nation?

52
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,500
- The same way you have
for the last 15 years,

53
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,563
with that beautiful smile of yours.

54
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,520
- Well, beautiful smiles are

55
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,980
a dime a dozen in this industry.

56
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,700
A month ago, I had three
national networks scouting me,

57
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,410
and not one of them's expressed interest.

58
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,760
- Not yet, I'm sure you'll
hear something soon.

59
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,143
- Thank you.

60
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,255
- [TV Announcer] Do you suffer
from excessive heartburn,

61
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:38,767
acid reflux, indigestion--

62
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:40,310
- You okay?

63
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,440
- Yeah, I'm just a little tired.

64
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,970
- Well why don't you take a few days off?

65
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,720
It'll be good for you.

66
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,800
- I'm all right, it's just some nights

67
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,430
are longer than others.

68
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,670
- Well yeah, you're pulling
10 hour shifts at the hospital

69
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,500
and then you're racing home
to take care of me and Brian

70
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,200
like we're not capable
of fending for ourselves.

71
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,313
- I'm fine, really.

72
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,090
- Look Audrey, I know
how stubborn you can be,

73
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,040
but if the job is
becoming too much for you,

74
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,763
I need you to be rational
enough to let it go, okay?

75
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,800
I made a vow to take care
of you and Brian, remember?

76
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,683
- Of course.

77
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,580
- So let me.

78
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,110
We're in a good place financially.

79
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,030
You don't have to work so hard.

80
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:18,863
- I love what I do.

81
00:06:18,863 --> 00:06:19,760
It's my profession.

82
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,290
- Of course it is.

83
00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:25,410
I gotta get goin'.

84
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,470
- No wait, let me make you lunch first.

85
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,240
- It's okay, I'll just have
Rosie grab me something, okay?

86
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,841
Hey.

87
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:34,440
Just take it easy today, okay?

88
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,340
- [Audrey] I will.

89
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,232
- Love you.

90
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,065
- [Audrey] Love you too.

91
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:45,009
- [Carrie] See you later
this afternoon, sweetheart.

92
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,623
- I hope you're nearly done up there.

93
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:52,475
(phone ringing)

94
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,243
Hello?

95
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,769
No, I'm just gonna catch up on some sleep.

96
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:05,804
(gentle music)

97
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:07,387
What are you doing?

98
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,968
- [TV Reporter] According
to Mount Sinai Hospital--

99
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,288
- Hey, let me call you back.
- Missing child advocate,

100
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:19,846
Valerie Whitaker has passed away.

101
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:21,831
Doctors say she died late last night

102
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:23,363
from heart complications.

103
00:07:23,363 --> 00:07:25,989
You may recall a little over a decade ago

104
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:27,477
when our network first
brought you coverage

105
00:07:27,477 --> 00:07:29,340
of the young, recovering drug addict.

106
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,340
- I understand that what I
did was selfish, and immoral.

107
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,710
And that nothing in this world can justify

108
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,640
me selling my child to people

109
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,273
in conditions unknown.

110
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,920
My only hope is

111
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:48,759
that my little boy,

112
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,753
wherever he is,

113
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,410
can find it in his heart
to forgive me. (sobbing)

114
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,730
- [TV Reporter] Following that interview,

115
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,640
Valerie Whitaker set out on
a national media campaign

116
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,523
to find her son.

117
00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:05,064
- Mom?

118
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:06,736
- Hi.

119
00:08:08,884 --> 00:08:11,717
(sorrowful music)

120
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:29,453
- You okay?

121
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,970
- Your breakfast is on the table.

122
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,260
Do you want milk or O.J?

123
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,093
- O.J.'s good.

124
00:08:36,093 --> 00:08:38,831
(bookbag thumps)

125
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,960
You sure you're okay?

126
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,120
- [Audrey] Yeah, I'm fine.

127
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,763
I was just watching the news.

128
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,533
- What happened?

129
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:51,860
(liquid pouring)

130
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,693
- Nothing.

131
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,680
When's your next match?

132
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,660
- The semifinals are Thursday night.

133
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,750
- As in tomorrow night?

134
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,583
- Yeah.

135
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,740
- I thought I told you
to tell me these things

136
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,806
at least a week in advance?

137
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:10,780
- I thought you knew.

138
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,460
- How would I know if you hadn't told me?

139
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,190
- Mom knew about it.

140
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,680
- Oh, and that's how you
keep me informed these days,

141
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,190
through your mom?

142
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,793
- I just thought maybe you
guys had talked about it.

143
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:21,923
- Well we haven't.

144
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,780
- So do you have work
tomorrow night or something?

145
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,960
- Yeah, I'm scheduled to.

146
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,092
You need to start telling
me these things sooner.

147
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:31,925
- Okay.

148
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,923
- I mean it, Brian.

149
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:35,360
I don't wanna miss another match

150
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,317
because you don't care
enough to tell me in advance.

151
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:39,343
- All right Mom, geez.

152
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,943
- Sorry.

153
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:54,643
(door closing)

154
00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:57,143
(crow cawing)

155
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,023
Bye.

156
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:18,971
(crow cawing)

157
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:20,487
(door closing)

158
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,705
(sinister music)

159
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:27,122
(computer keys clicking)

160
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,530
- So your parents put
you out of their home

161
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,000
at the age of 17, with no
other means of support.

162
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,030
Which you've stated, led
to a life of drug abuse,

163
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,180
alcoholism, even prostitution.

164
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,960
But how did you get to the point

165
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,993
of actually selling your newborn child?

166
00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:58,528
- There's no legitimate reason for it.

167
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,023
I was an addict.

168
00:11:05,986 --> 00:11:09,353
(sighs) I lived so recklessly at the time.

169
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,510
My only concern

170
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,200
was my next hit.

171
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,873
I would do anything to get it.

172
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,077
- So several years pass, and
you pay your debt to society.

173
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:27,110
And now you're referred to

174
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,983
as a crusader for missing children.

175
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,450
What do you make of that?

176
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,070
- [Valerie] I never anticipated

177
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,930
that outpouring of national
support to begin with,

178
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,583
so it all sort of came
as a surprise to me.

179
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,100
- [Reporter] So this isn't
just some sort of ploy

180
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,900
to win the affections of the public?

181
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,003
- Not at all.

182
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,660
The only reason I launched my campaign

183
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,163
was to find my son.

184
00:11:57,328 --> 00:11:58,411
Nothing more.

185
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,610
- So tell me, does it
ever bother you at all?

186
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,920
I can't even imagine
how difficult it must be

187
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,280
to play such a huge role in reuniting

188
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,313
a family with a missing child,

189
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,023
and still have no success
in finding your own.

190
00:12:22,564 --> 00:12:25,397
- (sniffles) Yes.

191
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,013
It is very difficult.

192
00:12:33,598 --> 00:12:35,848
(sniffles)

193
00:12:39,377 --> 00:12:42,613
But I do believe that I will find him.

194
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,973
I have to.

195
00:12:54,616 --> 00:12:57,699
(rock music playing)

196
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:06,658
(car door slamming)

197
00:13:06,658 --> 00:13:09,120
(woman speaking over loudspeaker)

198
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,640
- (knocks on door) Morning.

199
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,740
- [School Secretary]
Morning, can I help you?

200
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,220
- I'm a private investigator here

201
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,373
to pick up some court ordered documents.

202
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,250
- Do you know who you spoke with?

203
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,083
- Sure.

204
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,633
It's Gloria Patterson.

205
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,233
- Okay, give me a moment please.

206
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,473
Ms. Patterson?

207
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,293
Yeah, there is an investigator here.

208
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,170
All right.

209
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,293
Sure, thanks.

210
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,080
She'll be right with you.

211
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,610
- Eric Reese, I presume?

212
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,770
- [Eric] Yes.

213
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,720
- Can I see some identification please.

214
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,363
Thank you.

215
00:13:58,177 --> 00:13:59,010
He's a brilliant young man,

216
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,614
it's nothing serious, I hope?

217
00:14:00,614 --> 00:14:03,364
(sinister music)

218
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,053
- Thank you.

219
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,248
(woman speaking over loudspeaker)

220
00:14:06,248 --> 00:14:08,915
(phone ringing)

221
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,777
(car horn honking)

222
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:38,089
(phone ringing)

223
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:50,170
- Okay, and Tyler's still with you.

224
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,120
Okay, I'll be there in
like 15, 20 minutes.

225
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,180
Okay.

226
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,530
Yeah, okay, okay, I'm on my way now.

227
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,363
- Is everything okay?

228
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,210
- I'm so sorry, my sitter has an emergency

229
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,810
and there was no one else I could call.

230
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,430
- It's okay, I got some shut eye.

231
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,570
- I appreciate it.
- No problem.

232
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,990
Hey, I was gonna ask you, tomorrow night,

233
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,890
Brian has a match--

234
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,040
- No worries, I got it.

235
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,873
- You sure?

236
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:08,820
- I'll see you on Friday.

237
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,653
- Thank you.

238
00:15:13,387 --> 00:15:17,554
(woman speaking over loudspeaker)

239
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,960
- Do you mind if I sit here?

240
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,810
- Go ahead.

241
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,643
- Thanks.

242
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,490
You know, normally I
don't like hospital food,

243
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,030
but these salads are,

244
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,863
they're okay.

245
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,390
Didn't expect to see you here so early.

246
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,536
- I'm sorry, do I know you?

247
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:06,962
- Mmm mmm.

248
00:16:06,962 --> 00:16:08,620
We haven't met, I'm Eric.

249
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,640
How are you?

250
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,230
- Audrey.

251
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,810
- I know.

252
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,110
I've learned quite a bit about you.

253
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,943
- Have you?

254
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,163
- Yeah.

255
00:16:20,163 --> 00:16:21,253
And from what I gather,

256
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,380
you're a good person.

257
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,200
But I'm really more concerned
with what people don't know.

258
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,330
- Really, why is that?

259
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:42,766
- It's just part of the job.

260
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,373
- I see, well I better get back to work.

261
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,410
- I know about Brian.

262
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,543
- Who are you?

263
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,803
- Private investigator.

264
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:03,020
I was hired by the Whitaker estate to--

265
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,080
- Whitaker, who?

266
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,433
- Valerie Whitaker.

267
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,343
Her family.

268
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,440
- How long have you been following me?

269
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,433
- Just a few days.

270
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,780
Got a call to check out a lead

271
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,030
that another detective
came across in Boston.

272
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,310
- What does this have to do with Brian?

273
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,813
- Brian is Valerie's son.

274
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,800
It's got everything to do with him.

275
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,690
- I've gotta go.

276
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,610
- You know, my job is to provide a client

277
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,590
with information so they can move forward.

278
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,240
Normally, I would never even
be talking to a suspect.

279
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,783
But I'm willing to make a conveyance.

280
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,293
- A conveyance?

281
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,453
- To avoid a hearing.

282
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,050
Otherwise the estate
is gonna press charges.

283
00:17:56,286 --> 00:17:57,493
- I better get back.

284
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,240
- You know, I don't know
whether you heard or not,

285
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,223
but she died, two nights ago.

286
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,550
Reports are sayin' it
was heart complications.

287
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,640
No signs of a relapse.

288
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,053
They're sayin' it was stress
that caused it. (laughs)

289
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,823
Stress.

290
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,660
Of all things.

291
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,493
'Cause from what I heard,

292
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:21,843
she was one of the
biggest junkies in Boston.

293
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,420
But then (sniffles) I got to thinkin',

294
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,330
after spendin' several
years searching for a kid

295
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,771
who may or may not even be alive,

296
00:18:33,771 --> 00:18:35,120
(gentle music)

297
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,750
it gives you an idea of why her family

298
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,133
might think you were
the cause of her death.

299
00:18:55,189 --> 00:18:56,022
(phone ringing)

300
00:18:56,022 --> 00:19:00,487
(woman speaking over loudspeaker)

301
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:01,320
- Audrey.

302
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,253
Audrey!

303
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:05,086
- Yeah.
- You've been here

304
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:06,100
since this afternoon.

305
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,350
Why don't you go home?

306
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,510
- I'm fine, I'm just--

307
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,270
- Audrey, Audrey.
- a little, little--

308
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,720
- Go home and get some sleep.

309
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,505
We'll be fine.

310
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:16,463
(woman speaking over loudspeaker)

311
00:19:16,463 --> 00:19:19,213
(sinister music)

312
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:15,844
(phone beeping)

313
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,253
- Hey sweetheart.

314
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,683
No, not yet.

315
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,280
I know babe, I haven't forgotten.

316
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,410
I just, things got really busy here, and,

317
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,620
babe.

318
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,290
I'm gonna make it up
to the girls tomorrow.

319
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,204
Look, I'm gonna be outta
here in about an hour,

320
00:20:33,204 --> 00:20:34,620
and then I'm gonna come,

321
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,543
hello, Deb?

322
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:40,940
(sighs)

323
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,773
Shit.

324
00:20:48,326 --> 00:20:51,159
(engine starting)

325
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,870
- Hey.

326
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:59,900
- Hey.

327
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,800
You're home early.

328
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,750
- Yeah, I covered a
coworker this afternoon,

329
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,633
so my supervisor let me go early.

330
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,240
I got tomorrow night off.

331
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,073
- Cool.

332
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,356
- What are you still doing up?

333
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,793
- I'm just finishing this
paper for History class.

334
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,980
- Anything interesting?

335
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,700
- Not so much interesting
as it is monotonous.

336
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,573
History's always repeating itself.

337
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,060
You okay?

338
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,893
- Yeah.

339
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,050
I'm just proud of you is all.

340
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,946
- Thanks.

341
00:21:41,946 --> 00:21:44,529
(gentle music)

342
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,863
- Well, guess I'm gonna turn in.

343
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:57,040
I love you so much.

344
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,300
- [Brian] Love you too Mom.

345
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,690
- Don't stay up too late.

346
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,547
- [Brian] I won't.

347
00:22:00,547 --> 00:22:02,297
- 'Night.
- Goodnight.

348
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:25,218
(sniffling)

349
00:22:33,838 --> 00:22:36,005
(sobbing)

350
00:23:01,384 --> 00:23:04,134
(birds chirping)

351
00:23:13,373 --> 00:23:14,830
- Good morning.
- Morning.

352
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,663
- Did I wake you?

353
00:23:15,663 --> 00:23:17,200
- [Audrey] No, I wish you had though.

354
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,100
- Why, are you scheduled to be
at the hospital this morning?

355
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,940
- [Audrey] No, I got the day off.

356
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,220
- Okay, so what's the rush?

357
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,760
- You know I hate to sleep past seven.

358
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,963
- Yeah, well I figured
you needed some rest.

359
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,430
You seem frazzled, you okay?

360
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,430
- [Audrey] I'm fine.

361
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,610
- What are you doing?

362
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,200
- Getting started on breakfast.

363
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,520
- It's your morning off.

364
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,960
- Tell ya what, sit down, relax.

365
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,363
I'll take care of breakfast.

366
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,033
- Audrey.

367
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,413
- [Brian] Good morning.

368
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:51,560
- Good morning.
- Morning sweetheart,

369
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,280
breakfast'll be ready in a minute.

370
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,113
- Audrey.

371
00:23:55,053 --> 00:23:56,650
Audrey!
- What, he's gotta eat,

372
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,483
doesn't he?

373
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,313
- Grab your things, I'm
taking you to breakfast.

374
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,563
Come on, let's go.

375
00:24:04,563 --> 00:24:06,070
School's in an hour.

376
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,190
- Bye Mom.

377
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,780
- [Audrey] Bye.

378
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,180
- I don't know what the
hell is bothering you,

379
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,600
but if you decide you wanna talk later,

380
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,600
then give me a call.

381
00:24:19,895 --> 00:24:22,978
(gentle piano music)

382
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:44,812
(car alarm beeping)

383
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:53,868
(car door closing)

384
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:56,785
(car door closing)

385
00:25:00,474 --> 00:25:03,641
(frantic piano music)

386
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:43,034
(phone beeping)

387
00:25:43,034 --> 00:25:45,284
(sniffles)

388
00:25:51,527 --> 00:25:53,310
- (clears throat) This is Eric.

389
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,280
(sniffles)

390
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,750
Yeah, yeah, sure.

391
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,513
But I'm gonna need a little bit more time.

392
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,520
Well, just a day or two,

393
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,220
'cause I wanna make sure I
got all the info that I ...

394
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,123
Right.

395
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,550
Okay, yeah.

396
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:13,283
Yeah, I will bring in
everything I have tomorrow.

397
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,783
Sure.

398
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,003
You wanna talk?

399
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,040
- Where were they when she
nearly overdosed that night?

400
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,313
- I don't know.

401
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,760
It doesn't matter at this point.

402
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,342
They're not gonna stop until he turns up.

403
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:49,700
And the stakes are even higher now

404
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,083
that they have reason to
believe he's still alive.

405
00:26:54,898 --> 00:26:55,990
- So what are my choices?

406
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,400
- Well you can either give up custody

407
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,113
or risk goin' to trial.

408
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,963
- I'm not giving them custody.

409
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,440
I devoted my whole life to raising him.

410
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,670
- And you've done a hell of a job,

411
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,990
but her family couldn't care less.

412
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,360
To them, you're as
guilty for buyin' the kid

413
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,367
as she was for sellin' him,

414
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:19,563
and any court in the
country's gonna agree.

415
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,130
- Well I'm not interested
in making any arrangements,

416
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:27,640
and I don't care who these people are.

417
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,093
I'm not handing over my son.

418
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,870
- I hope you realize
how ugly this will get

419
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,173
for you and your family.

420
00:27:40,063 --> 00:27:42,063
(sighs)

421
00:27:47,946 --> 00:27:52,863
(students and teachers chattering quietly)

422
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,233
- Well it's good to see you.

423
00:27:58,233 --> 00:27:59,647
- Okay, see you soon.

424
00:27:59,647 --> 00:28:01,616
Good evening Audrey, how are you?

425
00:28:01,616 --> 00:28:03,270
- Hi, thanks how are you?

426
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,750
- Wonderful, looking
forward to Brian's match.

427
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,820
We're all very proud of him.

428
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,230
- Oh, so are we.

429
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,110
- I'm sure.

430
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,973
Also, I've been meaning to call you.

431
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:12,290
There's something I'd
like to talk to you about.

432
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,810
Maybe sometime next week?

433
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,870
- Sure, I can give you a call
first thing Monday morning.

434
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,030
- That's perfect.

435
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,220
Best of luck.

436
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,053
- Thank you.

437
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,164
- Hi.

438
00:28:22,482 --> 00:28:23,649
- Good.
- Good.

439
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,200
- Hey.
- Good evening everyone,

440
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,880
and welcome to the CHSC semifinal
regional chess tournament.

441
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,860
The winner of tonight's
match is going to advance

442
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,451
to the championship next month.

443
00:28:36,451 --> 00:28:37,850
(gentle piano music)

444
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,800
Good luck everyone.

445
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:59,945
- He's quite a tactician.

446
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,100
- What are you doing here?

447
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,230
- I thought you mighta changed your mind.

448
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,310
- Well I haven't, so
please stop following me.

449
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,223
- I'm tryin' to help you, Audrey.

450
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,060
- By tearing my family apart?

451
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,300
- That's the last thing I wanna do,

452
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,070
and you may not believe me,

453
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,690
but I commend you for what you've done.

454
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,960
You took Brian out of a bad situation,

455
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,010
you made a good life for him.

456
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,970
As far as I'm concerned,
you're his mother.

457
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,660
I'm not arguing that.

458
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,923
But you are goin' about
this the wrong way.

459
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,870
He could lose you, forever

460
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,603
if you drag this out any longer.

461
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,070
Look, he's 15 years old.

462
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,990
In three years, he'll be able
to make his own decisions,

463
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,590
the two of you can pick up
right where you left off.

464
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,160
Well look, I gotta submit
my evidence by tomorrow,

465
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,083
so please don't make
this hard on yourself.

466
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,123
- Do you have any kids?

467
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,093
- Two daughters.

468
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,110
- So you know what I'm
willing to sacrifice

469
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,170
to protect my child.

470
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,803
So please leave my family alone.

471
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,620
- Who's that?

472
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,503
- [Audrey] Nobody.

473
00:30:18,946 --> 00:30:20,450
♪ Spring this year ♪

474
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,200
- Were you really that nervous Mom?

475
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,650
- No.

476
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,710
- Your mom was squeezing
my hand like a vise.

477
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,893
- No I wasn't.

478
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,040
Maybe towards the end of the match.

479
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,210
- Mm hmm.

480
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,120
So when did you know you had it?

481
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,680
- The minute we sat down.

482
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,690
- Oh, come on.

483
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,523
- No really.

484
00:30:36,523 --> 00:30:37,650
He was distracted.

485
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,680
I could tell there was
something else on his mind

486
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,730
other than the match.

487
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,890
- So you smelled blood from the beginning?

488
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,570
- Blood, really Carrie?

489
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,440
It's a chess match, not the Crusades.

490
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,340
- No, he said he sensed a
weakness in his opponent

491
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,300
right from the beginning, right?

492
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,993
So that's how you felt, right?

493
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,140
- Honestly, yeah.

494
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,880
- Oh, you are a piece of work.

495
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,713
- That's my boy.

496
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,800
Is Brian still awake?

497
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,700
- No, he just turned in.

498
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,787
- It's kinda early for him, isn't it?

499
00:31:07,787 --> 00:31:09,280
- Well it might have been all that vanity

500
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,713
you served him with
dinner that put him over.

501
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,290
- What can I say, I'm proud of him.

502
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,890
- I am too, but I'd love to leave

503
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:19,950
a little room for his
ego to grow on its own.

504
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,720
- Well, let him gloat a little bit.

505
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,873
He was amazing tonight.

506
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,870
I tried calling you earlier today.

507
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,820
- I was out most of the day
doing errands and my phone died.

508
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,163
Is everything okay?

509
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,540
- Yeah.

510
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,970
Everything's okay.

511
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:38,980
You all right?

512
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,813
- Yeah.

513
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,503
I'm sorry about this morning.

514
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,013
- Yeah.

515
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,880
There was something I wanted
to talk to you about though.

516
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,390
- What's that?

517
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:56,040
- I gotta call from KBC
Network this morning.

518
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,660
They're interested in
bringing me on board.

519
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,160
- [Audrey] Are you serious?

520
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,570
- Yeah, I mean, nothing's definite yet,

521
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,300
and even if something happened,

522
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,460
I'd wanna discuss it as a family first.

523
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,090
- [Audrey] Of course.

524
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,200
When will you find out for certain?

525
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,590
- I'm supposed to fly out to New York

526
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,650
Monday for the interview.

527
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,430
- [Audrey] Oh, that's amazing honey.

528
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,410
I'm so happy for you!

529
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,710
- So I was thinking, it would
great if you came with me.

530
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,080
Just for the day.

531
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,110
You know, we fly out in the morning,

532
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,640
come back the same night.

533
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,500
- Sure.

534
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,754
- [Carrie] Yeah?

535
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:26,754
- Of course.

536
00:32:28,621 --> 00:32:29,954
- It'd be great.

537
00:32:40,402 --> 00:32:43,485
(lamp switch clicks)

538
00:32:49,024 --> 00:32:49,857
- Morning.

539
00:32:49,857 --> 00:32:50,690
- Good morning.

540
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,630
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't get up

541
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,987
in time to make your breakfast.

542
00:32:52,987 --> 00:32:54,073
- Oh, it's cool.

543
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,150
- Good morning, you.

544
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,350
- [Audrey] Good morning.

545
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,340
- Hey, good morning boy genius.

546
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,263
- [Brian] Morning Mom.

547
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,050
- So listen, I've got a
little extra time before work,

548
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,740
would you like to be
chauffeured to school?

549
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,940
- No thanks, I'm gonna catch up

550
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,830
with some friends on the way.

551
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,860
- As all great men should stay
in touch with the commoners.

552
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,693
- Turn it down some, Mom.

553
00:33:16,693 --> 00:33:18,950
I'm not even the champ yet.

554
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,817
- You are to me, so.

555
00:33:20,817 --> 00:33:21,893
Have a good day.

556
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,233
I love you.

557
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:25,066
- Love you.

558
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:25,969
- I love you.
- Love you.

559
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:28,552
(gentle music)

560
00:33:34,204 --> 00:33:35,037
- What?

561
00:34:15,826 --> 00:34:19,076
(radio playing softly)

562
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:25,613
♪ You are clearly ♪

563
00:34:25,613 --> 00:34:28,453
♪ You are clearly ♪

564
00:34:28,453 --> 00:34:31,870
♪ You are clearly better ♪

565
00:34:36,134 --> 00:34:37,076
(woman speaking over loudspeaker)

566
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:40,409
(man breathing heavily)

567
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,060
- [Audrey] Your blood
pressure's pretty high.

568
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,010
Have you taken any medication recently?

569
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,043
- No.

570
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,300
Just my insulin.

571
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,745
- Okay, have you had any
problems breathing at all?

572
00:34:53,745 --> 00:34:56,010
- (exhales loudly) No.

573
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,110
- Okay, the doctor'll be with you shortly.

574
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:03,060
(phone rings)

575
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,580
Patient's blood pressure
is extremely high.

576
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,413
- I'll go check on him.

577
00:35:06,413 --> 00:35:08,040
In the meantime, there's a young girl

578
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,740
with her foster mother down the hall.

579
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,590
She has a cut on her right
arm that requires stitching.

580
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,423
What concerns me most is that

581
00:35:13,423 --> 00:35:14,830
the cut may not have come

582
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,527
from a bike accident like she says it did.

583
00:35:16,527 --> 00:35:20,694
(woman speaking over loudspeaker)

584
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,393
- Nichelle?

585
00:35:25,393 --> 00:35:26,240
- Yes?

586
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,940
- That's a beautiful name.

587
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,550
- [Nichelle] Thank you.

588
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,630
- So I hear you hurt yourself pretty bad

589
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,030
on your way to school today.

590
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,710
- I fell off my bike.

591
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,370
- I tell her time and
time again to slow down

592
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,070
but she's always in such a hurry.

593
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:44,560
- Well let me take a look at it sweetie.

594
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,393
Whoops.

595
00:35:48,706 --> 00:35:50,770
(man speaking over loudspeaker)

596
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,090
This is pretty deep.

597
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,339
Was there glass on the sidewalk?

598
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:55,922
- I don't think so.

599
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,490
- Do you remember scraping your arm

600
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,810
on something sharp before falling?

601
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:02,930
- She fell off her bike

602
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,590
and scratched her arm on the pavement.

603
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,600
I already told the doctor that.

604
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,840
- I'm sorry Mrs. Brooks,
but this isn't a scratch,

605
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,830
it's a laceration.

606
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,883
- The doctor said he could stitch it up.

607
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,720
- Well we can.

608
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,980
- So why don't you go do that

609
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,460
so that we can get going and
she can get back in school.

610
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,293
- Sure.

611
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:25,425
Have you ever had stitches before?

612
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:26,258
- Once.

613
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,063
- Really?

614
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:28,896
When was that?

615
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,440
- Long before she came to stay with me.

616
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,510
If that's what you're getting at.

617
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:36,420
- I was just tryin' to
make her feel comfortable.

618
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,370
- I get it.

619
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,390
You think this is just
another abused child

620
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,100
and I'm just another unfit foster mother

621
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,240
who's taking advantage of the system.

622
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,610
Well you're wrong.

623
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,640
I've given my best to this child,

624
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,240
which is a stark difference
from what she's used to.

625
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,793
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

626
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:56,270
This is ridiculous, I'm gonna,

627
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,120
where's a doctor?

628
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,910
- Nichelle, I want you
to tell me the truth,

629
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,960
and I promise you won't get into trouble.

630
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,470
What happened to your arm?

631
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,710
This didn't come from a fall, did it?

632
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,113
Did she hurt you?

633
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,240
Believe me, I know you don't
wanna go back to a home,

634
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,373
but you don't deserve this kind of abuse.

635
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,770
- She's trying to accuse
me of hurting my child.

636
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,450
- I only asked because we have reason

637
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,200
to believe that her
laceration came from a blade.

638
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,220
- A blade, you think I
cut my child with a blade?

639
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,053
- I don't know.

640
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,120
- You're just eager to put

641
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,570
another black child in the system.

642
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,120
- I assure you Miss Brooks,
that's not the case.

643
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,340
Like she said, the laceration on her arm

644
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,730
does not look like it was caused
by her falling from a bike.

645
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,490
- Well if you don't
believe me, then ask her.

646
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,897
Now go on, ask her!

647
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,533
- Nichelle, is there
anything you wanna tell us?

648
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,460
- Don't be scared, honey.

649
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,773
- No.

650
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,730
- Okay, well let's get you all stitched up

651
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,030
so you can be on your way.

652
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:17,077
(woman speaking over loudspeaker)

653
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:21,880
- Blood pressure was a little
high, prone to medications.

654
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,490
- Yes, I need to speak to someone

655
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,690
from Child Protective Services.

656
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,213
- [Dr. Trotter] I just need
to stitch her up first!

657
00:38:27,213 --> 00:38:28,633
- We don't have time to sit around here.

658
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:29,466
- [Dr. Trotter] But if
we don't close the wound,

659
00:38:29,466 --> 00:38:30,620
it's likely to get infected.
- Doctor Barnell,

660
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,953
Doctor Barnell to Radiology.

661
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:36,980
- And coming up a little bit later,

662
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,560
we'll have a full weekend
wrap up on the Cubs games

663
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,810
as well as what's gonna happen

664
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,463
with the Blackhawks this season.

665
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:44,920
- It's been exciting.

666
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,440
I love October baseball,

667
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,853
and you know they're my favorite team.

668
00:38:47,853 --> 00:38:50,290
- Well hopefully this is the
year for the World Series.

669
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,520
- And here's a brief
look at today's forecast.

670
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,353
Robert?

671
00:38:53,353 --> 00:38:54,530
- Good morning!

672
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,880
Today is gonna be a nice one.

673
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,610
Sunny, with a high of 76 degrees.

674
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,980
And I'll have your weekend temperatures

675
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,440
later on in the forecast.

676
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,690
- Thank you Robert.

677
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,120
As the Occupy Wall
Street protests continue

678
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,640
to expand throughout the country,

679
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,550
city officials are looking for ways

680
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,410
to disperse the massive crowds

681
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,135
without violating civil rights.

682
00:39:13,135 --> 00:39:13,968
Good job, thanks.

683
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:15,950
- [Camera Man] Good work.

684
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:16,879
- Guys, thank you.

685
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:17,850
- [Camera Man] Great job Carrie.

686
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:18,790
- Hey.
- Hey.

687
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,650
- Any calls?

688
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,070
- Your agent called twice.

689
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,020
She said it's important
you get back to her.

690
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,000
- I'll call her.

691
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,010
- Okay, no problem.
- Excuse me,

692
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,560
Carrie Stewart?

693
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,393
- Yeah.

694
00:39:28,393 --> 00:39:30,440
- Hi, I'm Eric Reese, I'm an investigator.

695
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,850
I was hoping there was
someplace we could sit and talk.

696
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,200
- You're the man who was at my
son's chess match last night.

697
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,500
- Yeah, yeah, I was there.

698
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,340
- What's this about?

699
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,350
- It's about your spouse.

700
00:39:46,032 --> 00:39:50,199
(woman speaking over loudspeaker)

701
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,910
- I know you're not still mopin'

702
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,800
over what happened this morning.

703
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,890
We've seen a lot worse.

704
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,170
- I just don't understand
why they never speak up.

705
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,240
- You've been around long enough

706
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,230
to know how flawed the system is.

707
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,480
And for children who've been shipped

708
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,780
from place to place like she has,

709
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,473
it means a lot to be spoken for.

710
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,600
No matter how much she
has to suffer for it.

711
00:40:13,346 --> 00:40:14,179
- [Woman Speaking Over
Loudspeaker] Doctor Barnell

712
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:17,000
to Radiology, Doctor Barnell to Radiology.

713
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,583
(somber music)

714
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:24,314
(sorrowful piano music)

715
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:53,047
(zipper zipping)

716
00:40:55,206 --> 00:40:56,039
- Hey.

717
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,053
What's goin' on?

718
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,780
- That PI who you spoke to last night

719
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,910
came to see me at the station today.

720
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,551
Do you know what he told me?

721
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:09,610
He told me that my wife
illegally purchased

722
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,060
our son from his drug-addicted mother.

723
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,763
- It's more complicated than that, Carrie.

724
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,203
- I wanna know the truth!

725
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,470
- I didn't intend for
things to turn out this way.

726
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,303
I just wanted to protect him,

727
00:41:19,303 --> 00:41:21,225
and that's the only way I knew how.

728
00:41:21,225 --> 00:41:23,006
- What the hell were you thinking?

729
00:41:23,006 --> 00:41:24,300
That woman spent the past nine years

730
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,560
of her life searching for a child

731
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,020
that you've been secretly
harboring in our home.

732
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,180
- Harboring?

733
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,000
Harboring, is that what
you think I've been doing

734
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,520
for the last 15 years, harboring him?

735
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,030
She was a junkie, Carrie.

736
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,130
She would've sold him to
anyone for her next fix.

737
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,653
- She sold him to you.

738
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,540
Now her family's mad as shit
that you never came forward.

739
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,050
- I swear I didn't know she was looking

740
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,240
for him til the other day.

741
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,480
(zipper zipping)

742
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,730
- That's not good enough.

743
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:57,213
Why didn't you tell me about
this from the beginning?

744
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,513
You never gave me a choice.

745
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,560
Did you even think about how
this was gonna affect me?

746
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,393
My career?

747
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,980
It's gonna destroy us.

748
00:42:09,408 --> 00:42:11,358
- I'm sorry.
- Don't fucking touch me.

749
00:42:28,792 --> 00:42:30,292
- [Brian] Morning.

750
00:42:31,201 --> 00:42:32,650
- Morning.

751
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,787
- Is Mom still asleep?

752
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,720
- No.

753
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,553
She left.

754
00:42:41,655 --> 00:42:42,488
- Left where?

755
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,643
Mom?

756
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,913
- I haven't been honest with your mother,

757
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:55,323
or with you.

758
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,873
- Everything looks good.

759
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,033
This will certainly make the
Whitaker family very happy.

760
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,590
- As for the kid, I'd recommend

761
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:25,120
that he stay in the Stewart home

762
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,351
while this gets sorted out.

763
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:30,301
This is gonna be hard enough
for him when this goes public.

764
00:43:32,072 --> 00:43:32,905
- That all?

765
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:36,123
- Yeah.

766
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:43,610
- Before you go, is there anything else?

767
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:46,650
Maybe some undocumented information

768
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:49,744
that could help us with our client's case?

769
00:43:49,744 --> 00:43:50,850
- No.

770
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:51,683
It's all there.

771
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,450
- Yeah.

772
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,403
As always, great work.

773
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:59,373
We'll be in touch.

774
00:44:03,081 --> 00:44:05,664
(somber music)

775
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:22,226
- Fuck!

776
00:44:24,146 --> 00:44:28,956
- (sobbing) I'm so sorry, Brian.

777
00:44:28,956 --> 00:44:32,289
(sobbing) I'm so sorry.

778
00:45:02,987 --> 00:45:04,683
- I just got a call from Chicago.

779
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:11,463
They found him.

780
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,203
And he's alive and well.

781
00:45:16,978 --> 00:45:17,811
- Oh!

782
00:45:21,037 --> 00:45:23,204
(sobbing)

783
00:45:38,657 --> 00:45:41,157
(dog barking)

784
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:46,653
- You okay?

785
00:45:49,014 --> 00:45:49,931
- I'm fine.

786
00:45:57,324 --> 00:45:59,741
- Do you wanna talk about it?

787
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:01,423
Her?

788
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:05,463
- She was only 34 years old.

789
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,123
- I know.

790
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:14,163
She was just a kid when she had you.

791
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,340
- And no idea who my father was.

792
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:22,120
Coulda been any one of those
creeps she was screwing.

793
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:22,953
- Brian.

794
00:46:22,953 --> 00:46:24,582
- What?

795
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:26,103
I always knew I was adopted.

796
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,420
Just never cared to know
the details behind it.

797
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:35,123
- And I was hoping you never would.

798
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,203
- I know she was an addict.

799
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:49,747
But I wonder if she ever felt

800
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,600
like she was making the
best decision for me.

801
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,863
You think?
(dog barking)

802
00:47:02,193 --> 00:47:03,360
- I can't say.

803
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,300
- So what happens now?

804
00:47:11,503 --> 00:47:13,431
- I don't know.

805
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:16,264
(sorrowful music)

806
00:47:22,774 --> 00:47:25,691
(car horn honking)

807
00:47:36,217 --> 00:47:38,336
- Hello.
- Hi.

808
00:47:38,336 --> 00:47:39,169
- Where to?

809
00:47:39,169 --> 00:47:40,002
- O'Hare please.

810
00:47:40,002 --> 00:47:41,730
- Okay, thank you.

811
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:42,730
- Thank you.

812
00:48:13,854 --> 00:48:15,366
(engine revving)

813
00:48:15,366 --> 00:48:17,866
(car beeping)

814
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,238
- Brian, are you home?

815
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,238
- [Brian] In my bedroom.

816
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:52,970
- How was school?

817
00:48:54,006 --> 00:48:55,589
- It was all right.

818
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,403
- I'm gonna get started on dinner.

819
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,430
- I talked to Mom earlier.

820
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,193
- How is she?

821
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,700
- She said the interview went real well.

822
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,313
You should give her a call.

823
00:49:14,822 --> 00:49:16,621
(doorbell rings)

824
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:17,788
- I'll get it.

825
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,393
Can I help you?

826
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:37,226
- [Detective] Good afternoon ma'am,

827
00:49:37,226 --> 00:49:38,778
is your name Audrey Stewart?

828
00:49:38,778 --> 00:49:39,611
- Yes.

829
00:49:39,611 --> 00:49:41,280
- I need you to step outside.

830
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,630
You're under arrest for illegal adoption.

831
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:45,530
You have the right to remain silent.

832
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:46,363
Anything you say can
(handcuffs clicking)

833
00:49:46,363 --> 00:49:48,420
and will be used against
you in a court of law.

834
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,047
You have the right to an attorney.

835
00:49:50,047 --> 00:49:51,780
(handcuffs clicking)
If you cannot afford one, one

836
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,613
will be appointed for you.
(handcuffs clicking)

837
00:49:52,613 --> 00:49:54,308
Do you understand?

838
00:49:54,308 --> 00:49:57,058
(dramatic music)

839
00:50:01,459 --> 00:50:02,875
- [Brian] Mom!

840
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:03,875
- It's okay.

841
00:50:14,382 --> 00:50:15,965
- Against the wall.

842
00:50:18,998 --> 00:50:19,831
(camera clicking)

843
00:50:19,831 --> 00:50:22,802
Turn your head to the right.

844
00:50:22,802 --> 00:50:24,205
(camera clicking)

845
00:50:24,205 --> 00:50:26,808
Turn your head to the left.

846
00:50:26,808 --> 00:50:28,700
(camera clicking)

847
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,570
I need both of your thumbs,

848
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,213
place it on top of the screen.

849
00:50:34,918 --> 00:50:36,073
(machine beeping)

850
00:50:36,073 --> 00:50:38,587
Now your four fingers on both hands.

851
00:50:38,587 --> 00:50:41,817
Place 'em there on the screen.

852
00:50:41,817 --> 00:50:43,170
(machine beeping)

853
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,753
Okay, now just your right hand.

854
00:50:47,152 --> 00:50:49,985
(machine beeping)

855
00:50:54,904 --> 00:50:58,571
(door buzzing and clicking)

856
00:51:01,575 --> 00:51:04,658
(handcuffs clicking)

857
00:51:09,797 --> 00:51:12,464
(door slamming)

858
00:51:31,105 --> 00:51:33,107
(people chattering quietly)

859
00:51:33,107 --> 00:51:37,107
- [Courtroom Secretary]
Mm hmm, here you go now.

860
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:41,840
- Case number 75314 U.S. District Court

861
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,723
of Massachusetts versus Stewart.

862
00:51:46,987 --> 00:51:50,456
(handcuffs clanging)

863
00:51:50,456 --> 00:51:54,123
(people chattering quietly)

864
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,230
Case number 75314 U.S. District Court

865
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:07,333
of Massachusetts versus Stewart.

866
00:52:09,675 --> 00:52:11,450
Ms. Stewart, is your attorney present?

867
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:13,098
- I am, Your Honor.

868
00:52:13,098 --> 00:52:14,170
- And does your client understand

869
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:17,310
that she's being charged with
one count of illegal adoption,

870
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:19,670
and one count of child abduction?

871
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,510
- Yes, she does, Your Honor.

872
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,150
- [Judge] And how do you plea?

873
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:24,400
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

874
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:26,600
- Very well.

875
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,950
Your hearing will take place

876
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,940
in the Federal District
Court of Massachusetts,

877
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,660
two months from tomorrow.

878
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:34,373
Bond is set in the amount of $500,000.

879
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,850
If in fact, you do decide to post bail,

880
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,910
you are prohibited by
law to travel outside

881
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:41,800
the state of Illinois.

882
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,490
This interdiction will be lifted

883
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,270
one week prior to your trial

884
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:47,210
to allow you enough time to transition

885
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:48,900
to the state of Massachusetts.

886
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,730
In which your attorney must notify

887
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:52,780
the court before making any arrangements.

888
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,810
Do you understand?

889
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:56,360
- Yes, Your Honor.

890
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,409
- [Judge] Next case, State
of Illinois versus Hernandez.

891
00:53:00,409 --> 00:53:05,409
(somber music)
(people chattering quietly)

892
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:25,306
(keys jangling)

893
00:53:45,734 --> 00:53:46,672
(silverware clanging)

894
00:53:46,672 --> 00:53:51,672
♪ Rescued from that image
by a passing ambulance ♪

895
00:53:54,834 --> 00:53:59,834
♪ The skyline starts to hedge

896
00:54:02,578 --> 00:54:04,080
♪ She's at home now ♪
(silverware clanging)

897
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:09,080
♪ With the stars, sirens
and their drivers ♪

898
00:54:10,366 --> 00:54:12,866
♪ The fog now ♪

899
00:54:19,732 --> 00:54:22,043
- What are you doin'?

900
00:54:22,043 --> 00:54:22,960
- Studying.

901
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:24,853
- Can I come in?

902
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:41,080
- [Audrey] We have the
court-ordered DNA testing tomorrow.

903
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,243
- I know, Mom told me.

904
00:54:43,728 --> 00:54:44,613
- I'm sorry.

905
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:50,133
- No big deal, it's just a swab.

906
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:56,673
So what was it like spending
the night in the slammer?

907
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:01,253
- (snickers) Awful.

908
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,140
But to tell you the truth,

909
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,390
it's not the first time
I've been in holding.

910
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:08,663
- What'd you do?

911
00:55:08,663 --> 00:55:11,360
- (laughs) Well some
friends and I got in trouble

912
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,203
for vandalizing school property.

913
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:17,470
This feminist speaker came to campus,

914
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:19,330
and one of the sororities didn't approve,

915
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:21,150
so they had her banned.

916
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:22,963
- So you guys trashed their nest?

917
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:26,873
- It was more like we
tried to burn it down.

918
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:29,327
- You burned down their house?

919
00:55:29,327 --> 00:55:31,490
- (laughs) No, just the shrubbery.

920
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:34,140
The fire department got to
it before it could spread.

921
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,063
It was a huge mistake,
nothing I'm proud of.

922
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:43,623
- So are you worried about the hearing?

923
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:48,443
- No.

924
00:55:48,443 --> 00:55:50,563
I don't want you to worry about it either.

925
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:54,630
You have a lot of other
things to focus on.

926
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:56,040
And we wouldn't want your opponent

927
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,640
to think that you're distracted.

928
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,680
- Mom's pretty pissed at you.

929
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,650
- She has every right to be.

930
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:16,004
So do you.

931
00:56:20,153 --> 00:56:21,320
I love you.

932
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,852
See ya in the morning.

933
00:56:22,852 --> 00:56:24,117
- Good night.
- Night.

934
00:56:24,117 --> 00:56:26,700
(gentle music)

935
00:56:39,537 --> 00:56:43,454
I'm just getting some
linen for the guest room.

936
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:03,223
Hey.

937
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:04,953
- Hey.

938
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:09,780
I don't know what'll happen between us

939
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,533
when this is all settled, but ...

940
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:17,500
There's too much at stake to
let you go through this alone,

941
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,700
so you've got my support
for the time being.

942
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,120
I'll do what I can to help,

943
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,253
but that's all I can give you.

944
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:49,850
- [Audrey] Morning.

945
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:51,070
- You ready to go?

946
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:54,110
- I'm not scheduled to
meet Aaron until noon.

947
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:55,460
- I think it's best if we went in

948
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,130
a different direction for this one.

949
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:58,200
- [Audrey] But he's our attorney.

950
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,820
- Just trust me.

951
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,070
- [Blythe] You know we love you,

952
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:02,520
but Neal, I can't keep covering

953
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,510
your end of the timeshare.

954
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:05,080
That shit's gettin' too expensive.

955
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,330
- [Neal] I know, it's just that

956
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:08,300
alimony's kicking my ass right now.

957
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,920
- [Blythe] Yeah, well alimony
is a huge bitch to feed.

958
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,520
I'm no stranger to it.

959
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,250
My first husband was a struggling
artist, if you remember.

960
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,470
- I do.
- Now keep in mind,

961
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:17,713
I led the litter too, so.

962
00:58:17,713 --> 00:58:19,630
- [Neal] I hear ya loud and clear, Blythe.

963
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:20,610
I'll give you a call next week.

964
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:21,860
- You do that.

965
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:22,853
And take care.

966
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,780
Carrie, it's been years!
(phone rings)

967
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:31,620
How ya been?

968
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,743
- Good.

969
00:58:32,743 --> 00:58:34,340
- [Blythe] (laughs) You look it!

970
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,173
- Thanks.

971
00:58:35,173 --> 00:58:36,006
- So what are you doing here?

972
00:58:36,006 --> 00:58:37,600
Aren't you usually on
the air about this time?

973
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,670
- Yeah, I took the morning off.

974
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:41,280
- Everything okay?

975
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,890
- Yeah, Blythe, this is my wife, Audrey.

976
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,520
- It's nice to meet you Audrey.

977
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,903
- [Audrey] Nice to meet you.

978
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:50,490
- Why don't you two come
on back to my office.

979
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:01,163
That's, (sighs) it's quite a story.

980
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:05,333
Extremely complicated, it is.

981
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,030
And you're not speaking
theoretically, I assume.

982
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:13,270
You literally purchased
another woman's child.

983
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:14,600
- She rescued him.

984
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,433
- Right.

985
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:19,533
See, here's the thing.

986
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,770
Even with the mother's consent,

987
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:24,600
it would be difficult to convince

988
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,870
a jury that you rescued him,

989
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:28,370
considering you didn't turn him over

990
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:30,870
to Child Services to begin with.

991
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:33,430
Every bit of evidence points
in favor of the prosecution.

992
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:34,610
I don't even know what the purpose

993
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:37,020
of a hearing would be in a case like this.

994
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,490
Wouldn't last more than
two or three hours,

995
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:39,683
deliberations and all.

996
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,460
- So you're saying we
don't stand a chance?

997
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:44,293
- In hell.

998
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:47,580
I mean, any reputable law firm

999
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:48,920
would be leery of a case like this.

1000
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,023
You need a damn good one to represent you.

1001
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,660
I think you're better off
settling for a plea bargain.

1002
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,520
That is, if the prosecution
is charitable enough

1003
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,727
to extend you one.

1004
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:05,203
- A plea bargain?

1005
01:00:05,203 --> 01:00:06,893
That's the advice you have for me?

1006
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:09,453
- It's complicated, Audrey.

1007
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:15,050
- I understand that, but it's
a lot more complicated for me.

1008
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:16,680
My family is at stake.

1009
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,843
I could lose my son.

1010
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,140
- Well technically, he isn't your son.

1011
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:26,010
See, that's what makes your attempt

1012
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:28,403
to hold onto him legally impossible.

1013
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:35,060
Do you even know who
or where the father is?

1014
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,100
He'd be next of kin,

1015
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,700
so by law, he'd be
Brian's rightful guardian.

1016
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,700
- I mean, it could be any number of men.

1017
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,513
- Yeah, possibly.

1018
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,860
But I don't think you can fight this one.

1019
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:50,300
So my advice is to go home,

1020
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,820
explain everything to the kid,

1021
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,443
and send him to his
grandparents in Boston.

1022
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:59,253
And hope for leniency when the
judge decides your sentence.

1023
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:11,230
Please tell me you didn't know anything

1024
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:13,023
about this before you married her?

1025
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:17,220
All things considered,
your legal guardianship

1026
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,470
is null and void as well.

1027
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:22,470
- So what am I supposed to do now?

1028
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,910
I mean, I spent the last
10 years raising him.

1029
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:27,040
I can't afford for her
to lose the case either.

1030
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,410
- I'm sorry, I really am.

1031
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:31,210
But there's nothing I can do.

1032
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:33,990
I know I've developed a
rather incautious reputation

1033
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,350
throughout my career, but even I like

1034
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:36,633
to win from time to time.

1035
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,423
Nothing personal.

1036
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,353
- Right.

1037
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:50,687
(door slamming)

1038
01:01:57,112 --> 01:01:59,021
(somber music)

1039
01:01:59,021 --> 01:02:01,938
(Audrey sniffling)

1040
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:08,120
I thought she'd be able to help us.

1041
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:08,953
I'm sorry.

1042
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:17,350
We'll find good
representation though, okay?

1043
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:18,183
I promise.

1044
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:31,870
Mm hmm.

1045
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:35,160
Yeah well with Blythe's
appeal, they don't have time.

1046
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,283
Yeah sure, honesty?

1047
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,313
Okay, thanks Rosie.

1048
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:45,190
This one might be worth a try.

1049
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:47,510
He was a former supervisor
at the U.S. Attorneys Office

1050
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:49,400
and specializes in cases like this.

1051
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,053
- We're hard to call.

1052
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:55,910
- Food come yet?

1053
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:57,560
- No, but it should be here soon.

1054
01:03:02,773 --> 01:03:04,250
(refrigerator door slamming)

1055
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:06,070
- Another voicemail.

1056
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:07,370
Hi, this is Carrie Stewart.

1057
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:08,960
I'd like to schedule a consultation

1058
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,140
some time this week if possible.

1059
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,004
Please call me at 312-

1060
01:03:13,004 --> 01:03:16,710
(doorbell rings)
555-7328.

1061
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:17,543
Thanks.

1062
01:03:22,058 --> 01:03:23,870
(doorbell rings)

1063
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:25,403
I thought you were starving.

1064
01:03:33,715 --> 01:03:35,960
- Hey, so if I take on your case,

1065
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,040
I'll have to petition the court

1066
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,580
to represent you pro hac vice,

1067
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:40,920
since the hearing takes
place out of state.

1068
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,000
However, the court has complete discretion

1069
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,550
to grant permission or deny it,

1070
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:46,330
but I'm confident they'll permit it.

1071
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:48,550
You being the client, of
course will be responsible

1072
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:50,100
for all additional costs in the case.

1073
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:53,173
That'd be my travel expenses,
lodging expenses, et cetera.

1074
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:55,960
Can I come in?

1075
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:59,410
- Yeah.
(gentle music)

1076
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:02,260
Hey, listen, I'm really sorry

1077
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:04,080
about being so harsh earlier.

1078
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,820
It was extremely rude of me,

1079
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:08,870
but if you're still
interested in my services,

1080
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:11,070
I would be more than
happy to represent you.

1081
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,720
- Absolutely.

1082
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,143
- [Blythe] But let me warn you,

1083
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:17,220
this is gonna be a tough one.

1084
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,410
- [Audrey] I know.

1085
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:20,090
- So get started tomorrow morning,

1086
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:21,643
in my office, 10:00 a.m?

1087
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,806
- I'll be there.

1088
01:04:23,806 --> 01:04:25,690
- Is this the food?

1089
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:26,900
Oh, hi.

1090
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:27,810
- Hello.

1091
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:29,380
And you are?

1092
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:30,820
- Brian.

1093
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:32,893
- So you're what all
the fuss is about, huh?

1094
01:04:33,805 --> 01:04:35,020
- No, I'm just hungry.

1095
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:37,470
(Blythe laughs)

1096
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:38,309
- See you tomorrow.

1097
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:39,142
- Bye.
- Bye.

1098
01:04:39,142 --> 01:04:41,725
(gentle music)

1099
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:46,429
- So that pretty much sums up

1100
01:05:46,429 --> 01:05:49,010
the questions I'll be asking you, okay?

1101
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:52,570
But then the prosecution is
gonna get a little uglier, okay?

1102
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:53,403
So we're gonna go through some of

1103
01:05:53,403 --> 01:05:55,240
the questions they might ask you.

1104
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,820
First of all, state
your name for the court.

1105
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:57,653
- [Brian] Brian Stewart.

1106
01:05:57,653 --> 01:05:59,070
- And how old are you, Brian?

1107
01:05:59,070 --> 01:05:59,903
- 15.

1108
01:05:59,903 --> 01:06:00,736
- Nice.

1109
01:06:00,736 --> 01:06:02,080
What are your parent's names?

1110
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,010
- Audrey and Carrie.

1111
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:06,150
- Audrey and Carrie, Audrey
and Carrie, Audrey and Carrie.

1112
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:08,130
Now those are both female
names, aren't they?

1113
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:08,963
- Yes.
- Ahh.

1114
01:06:08,963 --> 01:06:10,633
So you don't have a father?

1115
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,280
- No I do not.

1116
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,800
- [Blythe] No, no father.

1117
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,710
Have you ever wondered why
you don't have a father?

1118
01:06:19,488 --> 01:06:20,321
- No.

1119
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:21,600
- [Blythe] What has your mother told you

1120
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,623
about your father and your mother?

1121
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,920
- Not much, I didn't want to know.

1122
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,960
- [Blythe] You didn't want to know.

1123
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:36,610
Well has your mother
ever told you anything

1124
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:38,354
about your birth mother?

1125
01:06:38,354 --> 01:06:40,937
(gentle music)

1126
01:07:47,086 --> 01:07:48,478
- So how's the family?

1127
01:07:48,478 --> 01:07:49,400
- Good.

1128
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,370
My husband just retired,

1129
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:52,420
my son's finally settling down.

1130
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,670
He and Joyce Pollock are

1131
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:55,391
gonna be tying the knot next summer.

1132
01:07:55,391 --> 01:07:58,070
- Ah, congratulations mother-in-law to-be.

1133
01:07:58,070 --> 01:07:58,903
- Congratulations.

1134
01:07:58,903 --> 01:07:59,820
- [Blythe] Thank you.

1135
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:00,970
- Wow, Joyce Pollock, I don't think

1136
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:03,230
I've seen her since she was teenager.

1137
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:05,470
- Well she grew up to
be a fine young woman.

1138
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:08,620
A lot less frumpy than
her mother. (laughs)

1139
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:09,720
I mean, she's no fashion mogul,

1140
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,935
but at least she knows how
to dress herself. (laughs)

1142
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:15,417

- You honestly wanna know?

1148
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:25,840
- I do.

1149
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,040
- Please don't.

1150
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,253
- I wanna know.

1151
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,940
- Carrie, your wife would like to know

1152
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:33,590
the dynamics of our relationship.

1153
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:38,173
- Fine, Blythe was my
mentor throughout college.

1154
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:41,190
- That's it?

1155
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:42,023
- It's true.

1156
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,020
However, it's a long story
as to how that came to be,

1157
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:49,210
considering that I was
her father's mistress

1158
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:51,239
for several years before that. (laughs)

1159
01:08:51,239 --> 01:08:53,610
- Get outta here! (laughs)

1160
01:08:53,610 --> 01:08:56,480
- I'm serious, as God as my witness,

1161
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,020
I fucked that old man
through my entire undergrad.

1162
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:01,300
Shamelessly, I might add.

1163
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:04,400
Professor Stewart was a
very handsome man back then.

1164
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:07,400
- Wow.

1165
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,233
- Wow.

1166
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:13,080
- You never know. (laughs)

1167
01:09:14,888 --> 01:09:16,500
- Thank you so much for coming by.

1168
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,300
- Oh, it was absolutely my pleasure.

1169
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:23,070
And you sir, are a class act.

1170
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:24,540
- Thanks.

1171
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,300
Carrie, you still upset with me?

1172
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,060
- [Carrie] Yeah, go to hell, Blythe.

1173
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,810
- Well. (laughs)

1174
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:30,643
I'll see ya later in the morning.

1175
01:09:30,643 --> 01:09:31,476
- Okay.

1176
01:09:31,476 --> 01:09:32,309
Get home safe.

1177
01:09:32,309 --> 01:09:33,390
- [Blythe] Thank you,
thanks for everything.

1178
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:34,620
- Yep.

1179
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:35,843
Good night.
- Bye bye.

1180
01:09:40,087 --> 01:09:43,710
(people chattering)

1181
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:48,710
(reporters yelling)
(cameras clicking)

1182
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:56,180
- First and foremost, my family would like

1183
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:58,430
to thank all those who supported Valerie

1184
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:00,810
in her pursuit to find her son.

1185
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:04,300
And although she did not
live to see that day,

1186
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,630
our family remained hopeful

1187
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:08,483
and vowed to see to it that
her work was not in vain.

1188
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,770
And now I'm happy to say that

1189
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:14,163
that day of redemption has finally come.

1190
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:17,460
As we were recently
informed by our attorneys

1191
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:19,790
that after 12 years of searching,

1192
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:24,790
Valerie's son, our
grandson, has been found.

1193
01:10:24,966 --> 01:10:27,160
(reporters yelling)

1194
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:29,130
I am not at liberty
(cameras clicking)

1195
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:30,530
to discuss his whereabouts,

1196
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:32,940
but can assure you we are
doing everything we can

1197
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:36,003
to bring him home where he belongs.

1198
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:37,885
Thank you.
- Mr Whitaker--

1199
01:10:37,885 --> 01:10:40,214
(reporters yelling)
- I have no more questions.

1200
01:10:40,214 --> 01:10:41,881
Thank you very much.

1201
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:45,322
(gentle music)

1202
01:10:56,345 --> 01:10:58,467
(water running)

1203
01:10:58,467 --> 01:10:59,634
- [Brian] Mom!

1204
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:04,000
- My family would like to thank

1205
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,790
all those who supported Valerie

1206
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:08,290
in her pursuit to find her son.

1207
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:11,117
And although she did not
live to see that day,

1208
01:11:11,117 --> 01:11:13,730
our family remained hopeful
and vowed to see to it

1209
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:15,473
that her work was not in vain.

1210
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:19,110
And now I'm happy to say that

1211
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:21,293
that day of redemption has finally come.

1212
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:23,790
As we were recently informed--
- Shit

1213
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:26,374
- [John] By our attorneys that
after 12 years of searching--

1214
01:11:26,374 --> 01:11:27,207
- [Carrie] The Press is outside.

1215
01:11:27,207 --> 01:11:28,743
- [John] Valerie's son,

1216
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:32,404
our grandson, has been found.

1217
01:11:32,404 --> 01:11:36,221
(reporters yelling)

1218
01:11:36,221 --> 01:11:38,888
(phone ringing)

1219
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:44,040
- Well what did you expect
would happen Audrey?

1220
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,860
Her father's a former Chief Justice,

1221
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:47,460
she's a national headliner.

1222
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:50,280
This isn't the crackwhore
you treated 15 years ago.

1223
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:53,650
She's the fucking Mother
Teresa of missing children.

1224
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:55,260
And quite frankly, she's more dangerous

1225
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:56,683
to us dead than alive.

1226
01:12:01,658 --> 01:12:03,940
Well the prosecution
is clearly responsible

1227
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:06,090
for the media frenzy
in front of your home.

1228
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:08,960
The fact that you're
married to a local celebrity

1229
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,363
only heightens the tension.

1230
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,200
- So what are we supposed to do?

1231
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,980
- There's nothing you can do.

1232
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:19,813
Go home.

1233
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:21,803
Get some rest.

1234
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:24,400
Then prepare for the ugliest battle

1235
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,370
you'll ever face in your life.

1236
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:28,953
(somber music)

1237
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:43,280
And make no mistake Audrey,

1238
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,680
they intend to make an example out of you.

1239
01:13:03,964 --> 01:13:04,797
- Shit.

1240
01:13:19,022 --> 01:13:19,855
Carrie?

1241
01:13:28,512 --> 01:13:29,345
Hey.

1242
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:37,083
- The station put me on mandatory leave.

1243
01:13:58,931 --> 01:14:01,098
(sobbing)

1244
01:14:12,621 --> 01:14:15,121
(phone dings)

1245
01:14:24,052 --> 01:14:26,948
(knocking)

1246
01:14:26,948 --> 01:14:27,781
- Cynthia!

1247
01:14:54,165 --> 01:14:54,998
Excuse me!

1248
01:15:56,746 --> 01:15:59,413
(phone ringing)

1249
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,183
- Hello?

1250
01:16:04,183 --> 01:16:06,210
- [Blythe] Hey Carrie, I
can't get ahold of Audrey.

1251
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:07,043
She around?

1252
01:16:07,043 --> 01:16:08,460
- No, she's out.

1253
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,730
- Well listen, I need
to leave immediately.

1254
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:11,563
- [Carrie] Leave where?

1255
01:16:11,563 --> 01:16:13,540
- For Boston, tonight if possible.

1256
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:15,410
- Tonight, well the hearing's
not for another month.

1257
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:17,450
- [Blythe] Look, I came
across some information

1258
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:19,813
that I think is going to
be very helpful to us.

1259
01:16:19,813 --> 01:16:21,443
But I need to leave right away.

1260
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:23,380
- What do you need?

1261
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,310
Uh huh.

1262
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:27,827
Mm hmm.

1263
01:16:27,827 --> 01:16:28,713
Are you sure?

1264
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:31,870
Okay.

1265
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:34,865
I'll make the travel
arrangements and send 'em over.

1266
01:16:34,865 --> 01:16:35,920
- All right, good, good.

1267
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,900
Oh, and I'm gonna need a swab from Brian.

1268
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:42,234
I'll send details on where to
go as soon as I get to Boston.

1269
01:16:42,234 --> 01:16:43,067
Bye.

1270
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:49,313
- Is everything okay?

1271
01:16:54,671 --> 01:16:57,921
(waves gently lapping)

1272
01:17:03,095 --> 01:17:05,345
(sniffles)

1273
01:17:19,254 --> 01:17:21,504
(sniffles)

1274
01:17:32,539 --> 01:17:36,456
(inhaling and exhaling deeply)

1275
01:18:24,855 --> 01:18:28,272
(people talking quietly)

1276
01:18:31,930 --> 01:18:33,420
- All rise.

1277
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:36,020
The U.S. District Court is now in session.

1278
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:37,393
Judge Pilsen presiding.

1279
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:39,923
Please be seated.

1280
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:48,900
- 16 years ago a child,

1281
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:52,150
my client's newborn grandson,

1282
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:55,613
was illegally purchased by the defendant.

1283
01:18:56,770 --> 01:19:00,770
And even though the child's
mother willingly sold him,

1284
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:05,083
this transaction was completely unlawful.

1285
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:09,320
So you ask, how is it even possible

1286
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,980
that the defendant could function

1287
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:15,763
as this child's caretaker
for so many years?

1288
01:19:16,886 --> 01:19:18,773
And the answer is forgery.

1289
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:24,180
And we will provide
irrefutable evidence proving

1290
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:26,710
that legal adoption forms

1291
01:19:26,710 --> 01:19:30,290
were indeed forged by the defendant,

1292
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:32,230
which allowed her to function

1293
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:37,230
as the child's legal guardian
for the past 15 years.

1294
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:40,400
Now throughout this hearing,

1295
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,230
you'll probably hear stories

1296
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:45,100
of Valerie Whitaker's drug abuse

1297
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:48,400
and other habits which
may have discredited

1298
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,713
her ability to be a good parent.

1299
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:56,030
But keep in mind this woman,

1300
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:59,930
who we all know now as
a national spokesperson

1301
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:04,310
for missing children
rehabilitated her life,

1302
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:07,110
paid her debt to society,

1303
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:09,803
and set out to find her son.

1304
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:14,140
It was the defendant who withheld,

1305
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:17,530
not the privilege, but the legal right

1306
01:20:17,530 --> 01:20:20,783
to reunite Valerie with her son.

1307
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:26,270
And this hearing has
absolutely nothing to do

1308
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:30,083
with the defendants inability
to care for this young man.

1309
01:20:31,150 --> 01:20:32,270
No.

1310
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:37,270
No, we are here today to bring restoration

1311
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,953
to the Whitaker family.

1312
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:45,690
- Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

1313
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:47,430
As the prosecution just stated

1314
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:50,070
in his rather lengthy soliloquy,

1315
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:52,820
my client did indeed
purchase the newborn child

1316
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:54,880
belonging to Valerie Whitaker.

1317
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,660
But ironically, it turned
out to be for his own good.

1318
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:00,430
Sounds ridiculous, I know.

1319
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:02,980
But my client, Audrey Stewart,

1320
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:05,270
wanted to provide this
child with a better life

1321
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:07,410
than his drug-addicted mother could.

1322
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:08,610
And she did.

1323
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:11,430
A very good life, in fact.

1324
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:13,010
And no one could have predicted this,

1325
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:15,580
not even the great
Valerie Whitaker herself,

1326
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:18,793
considering that the
transaction was anonymous.

1327
01:21:20,410 --> 01:21:21,900
That's right,

1328
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,770
Valerie Whitaker had no idea

1329
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:26,100
who she was selling her baby to.

1330
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,270
Coulda been a pedophile for all she knew.

1331
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:30,650
Luckily, it was my client

1332
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:33,483
who took that child in
and loved him as her own.

1333
01:21:38,450 --> 01:21:41,020
- After you were hired for this case,

1334
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:44,130
where did your investigation begin?

1335
01:21:44,130 --> 01:21:45,560
- At St. Gregory Hospital.

1336
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,220
It was the last place
Valerie had been seen

1337
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:49,710
before she returned home a year later.

1338
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:52,883
- And what sort of information
did you come across there?

1339
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:55,083
- Nothing really.

1340
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,630
The staff had changed significantly,

1341
01:21:57,630 --> 01:22:00,410
so at that point, I had to rely heavily

1342
01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:03,410
on the hospital's records for
the information that I needed.

1343
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:05,890
- Was that helpful to you?

1344
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:07,372
- Not at the beginning.

1345
01:22:07,372 --> 01:22:08,920
A lot of the records were rearranged

1346
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,010
and some of them appeared to be missing.

1347
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:12,460
- [Richard] Missing, you say.

1348
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:14,503
- That's correct.

1349
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:17,450
- So what did you do then?

1350
01:22:17,450 --> 01:22:19,430
- I investigated the
hospital for another week,

1351
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:21,560
and then Valerie requested that I help her

1352
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,340
with a couple of other
investigators on another case.

1353
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:25,243
- Why was that?

1354
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:28,230
- Her campaign started
receiving the attention

1355
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:30,380
of a lot of others with
similar situations.

1356
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:32,810
Nothing quite like hers,

1357
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:35,840
but similar in that they were
missing children as well.

1358
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,210
- And within those nine
years through her campaign,

1359
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:45,210
how many families were reunited
with their missing children?

1360
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:46,720
- [Matt] Seven.

1361
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,920
- Seven, that's remarkable.

1362
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:49,990
- Yes it is.

1363
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:52,440
I'm damn proud to be a part of it.

1364
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:53,483
- You should be.

1365
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:59,350
So what caused you to
reevaluate Valerie's case?

1366
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:01,340
- I started to feel guilty.

1367
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:03,870
All of us did, because
we were helpin' others

1368
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:05,170
find their missin' loved ones,

1369
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:07,833
and Valerie's son was
still out there somewhere.

1370
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:11,210
- Was she ever bitter about that?

1371
01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:14,460
- No, she was always callin' the shots.

1372
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:15,910
She often talked about how it was

1373
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:18,249
a rewarding experience for her.

1374
01:23:18,249 --> 01:23:20,280
I think she felt indebted
to her supporters.

1375
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,890
I made it a priority though

1376
01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:23,610
to see to it that it
was just as fulfilling

1377
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:25,560
for her as it was for everyone else.

1378
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:30,330
- So that's when you decided
to return to the hospital

1379
01:23:30,330 --> 01:23:32,620
and continue your investigation?

1380
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:34,000
- Yeah.

1381
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,020
I was givin' the records
another look-through,

1382
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:39,880
and I realized that of all
the staff that had moved on,

1383
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:42,310
the defendant was the
only one that relocated.

1384
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:44,730
So I discovered her whereabouts,

1385
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:47,820
and that's when we reached
out to our contact in Chicago.

1386
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:49,723
- Thank you Mr. Collins.

1387
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,343
No further questions Your Honor.

1388
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:58,083
- Mr. Collins,

1389
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:01,920
for a minute there I thought
your statement was reputable.

1390
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,920
In fact, you nearly
escaped cross-examination.

1391
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,900
But then, you mentioned

1392
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:10,170
that in your first investigation
at St. Gregory's Hospital,

1393
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:11,860
there were documents that had been

1394
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:14,540
rearranged or misplaced, correct?

1395
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:16,000
- Correct.

1396
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,250
- But I'm pretty sure that I possess

1397
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:21,310
the same hospital records
that you investigated.

1398
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:22,143
Am I right?

1399
01:24:22,143 --> 01:24:23,890
- I'm sure you do.

1400
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:25,130
- So do you think the prosecution

1401
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:27,070
would send me faulty documents?

1402
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:28,390
- Of course not.

1403
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:30,940
- Well the hospital records that I possess

1404
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:34,605
are pretty consistent
for the last 20 years.

1405
01:24:34,605 --> 01:24:35,438
- So? (chuckles)

1406
01:24:35,438 --> 01:24:36,320
what's the problem?

1407
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:39,690
- The problem is that the jury

1408
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:41,890
is hanging on your every word.

1409
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:43,360
And you're making cryptic statements

1410
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,840
that incriminate my
client when you suggest

1411
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,810
that files have been
rearranged or misplaced.

1412
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:50,670
You made the impression that my client

1413
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:51,530
may have been responsible.

1414
01:24:51,530 --> 01:24:53,347
- I never said that.

1415
01:24:53,347 --> 01:24:54,890
It coulda been a hospital
error for all I know.

1416
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:57,100
- Then let the record show that my client

1417
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,730
had nothing to do with the rearrangement

1418
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:01,500
or misplacement of hospital documents.

1419
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,850
But as Mr. Collins just implied,

1420
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:06,290
it was due to the negligence
of St. Gregory Hospital,

1421
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:08,800
and see if that doesn't get
ya a defamation lawsuit.

1422
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:11,240
- Objection, Your Honor.

1423
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:14,160
She's embellishing my witness's statement.

1424
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:15,023
- Sustained.

1425
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:18,120
Cut it out, Counselor.

1426
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:20,300
And let the record show

1427
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,960
that nothing in the witness's statement

1428
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,230
is denigrating to St. Gregory Hospital.

1429
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:26,923
- No further questions, Your Honor.

1430
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:30,823
- Any further questions for
this witness, Counselor?

1431
01:25:32,010 --> 01:25:33,430
- No further questions, Your Honor.

1432
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:34,820
- Then we'll break for recess.

1433
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:36,708
This hearing will proceed in one hour.

1434
01:25:36,708 --> 01:25:39,208
(gavel banging)

1435
01:25:45,170 --> 01:25:46,040
- Mom!

1436
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,190
- [Audrey] Hey sweetie.

1437
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:50,003
- Hi.
- Hi.

1438
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,830
- How you holdin' up in there?

1439
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:54,100
- Fine.

1440
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:54,933
- Hey guys.
(phone rings)

1441
01:25:54,933 --> 01:25:55,766
- Hi.

1442
01:25:55,766 --> 01:25:57,220
- Oh, I need to take this.

1443
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:58,376
I'll see you in an hour.

1444
01:25:58,376 --> 01:25:59,709
- [Audrey] Okay.

1445
01:26:00,928 --> 01:26:02,840
- Do you wanna grab lunch?

1446
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:04,180
- [Audrey] I don't have
much of an appetite.

1447
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:06,280
Why don't you guys grab lunch without me.

1448
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,470
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'll grab

1449
01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:08,590
something later.

1450
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:09,423
I'm fine.

1451
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:11,300
- [Carrie] See you soon.

1452
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,510
- [Audrey] Okay.

1453
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:13,343
- Bye.

1454
01:26:13,343 --> 01:26:14,176
- [Audrey] Bye.

1455
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:23,820
- And how long was it before you realized

1456
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:28,820
that the signatures on the
adoption forms were inauthentic?

1457
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,230
- Right away.

1458
01:26:30,230 --> 01:26:33,000
The signature that Valerie used
to sign all of her documents

1459
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,320
was different from the
signature on the adoption forms.

1460
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,153
- How different?

1461
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:39,453
- Significantly.

1462
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:43,260
The defendant signed Valerie's full name

1463
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:44,600
on the adoption forms,

1464
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:49,430
but Valerie normally just
signed her name as V Whit.

1465
01:26:49,430 --> 01:26:51,573
- How did you confirm this?

1466
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:55,610
- Several signatures from Valerie,

1467
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:58,530
including the signature on
the adoption forms were sent

1468
01:26:58,530 --> 01:27:02,300
to a local forensic document
examiner for analysis.

1469
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:06,590
- Which proved that the
signatures on those adoption forms

1470
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:10,043
were indeed fraudulent, is that correct?

1471
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:12,380
- That's correct.

1472
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:14,963
- Thank you Mr. Reese.

1473
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:17,660
No further questions, Your Honor.

1474
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,250
- I've always heard that
private investigators

1475
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:31,060
have the keenest sense
of guilt and innocence

1476
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:34,890
when they do the bidding of
their employers, regardless.

1477
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:36,723
But they always seem to know the truth.

1478
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:38,660
- Most of the time.

1479
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:41,260
- And in the seven years

1480
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,970
that you've worked with
the U.S. Attorneys Office,

1481
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:45,380
have you ever disagreed
with an assignment?

1482
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:46,970
- None that I can recall.

1483
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:48,420
- And how many assignments would you say

1484
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:51,220
they've given you since working with them?

1485
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:52,360
- I don't know,

1486
01:27:53,490 --> 01:27:55,580
12 or 10 I guess.

1487
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:57,080
- And with what I've
read from your records,

1488
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:59,320
you've always recorded the conversations

1489
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:01,070
you have with the suspect, correct?

1490
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:04,040
- The ones that I've talked to, yeah.

1491
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:06,470
- And how many conversations did you have

1492
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:07,883
with my client, Mr. Reese?

1493
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:12,905
- Three.

1494
01:28:12,905 --> 01:28:15,930
- [Blythe] And why didn't you
record those conversations?

1495
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:19,390
- [Eric] It was at my
discretion, and I chose not to.

1496
01:28:19,390 --> 01:28:20,980
- Fair enough.

1497
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:24,300
But you also had a conversation
with my client's wife.

1498
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:26,620
What was said in that conversation,

1499
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:28,220
which you also failed to record?

1500
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:32,780
- I tried to convince Carrie Stewart

1501
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:35,680
to surrender Brian to the Whitaker estate.

1502
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:38,720
- To which she told you
to go to hell, I assume.

1503
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:39,820
- Something like that.

1504
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:43,730
- Did you not tell my client

1505
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:47,670
that if she were willing to
surrender her parental rights,

1506
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:50,023
she could avoid a setting like this one?

1507
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:52,470
- I did.

1508
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:54,490
- But you're not in a position
to promise such a thing,

1509
01:28:54,490 --> 01:28:56,220
are you Mr. Reese?

1510
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:57,640
- No.

1511
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:01,970
- But in your undocumented
conversations with my client,

1512
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:03,580
you certainly seemed to favor

1513
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:06,373
my client over your assignment.

1514
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,103
On the evening of September 23rd,

1515
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,617
you told my client, and I quote,

1516
01:29:14,617 --> 01:29:17,167
"You took a child out of a bad situation

1517
01:29:17,167 --> 01:29:19,143
"and provided a better life for him.

1518
01:29:20,007 --> 01:29:22,917
"You're his mother, as
far as I'm concerned."

1519
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:28,200
Did you not say those words, Mr. Reese?

1520
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:33,050
Keep in mind, you're
under oath, Mr. Reese.

1521
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:35,923
- I did.

1522
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:40,330
- And isn't that contrary to
what your employer believes?

1523
01:29:40,330 --> 01:29:41,400
- Yes.

1524
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,700
- So then it would probably be safe to say

1525
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:45,500
you don't always agree
with the assignments

1526
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,533
given you by the U.S. Attorneys Office.

1527
01:29:48,490 --> 01:29:49,690
- Correct.

1528
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:50,900
- Thank you.

1529
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:52,550
No further questions, Your Honor.

1530
01:29:58,670 --> 01:30:00,240
- And Valerie felt like she was

1531
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:03,530
finally making a positive
contribution to the world.

1532
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:06,330
- And you were very proud of her.

1533
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:10,710
After all she had accomplished
for the past 12 years.

1534
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:11,543
- Absolutely.

1535
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:14,210
My only wish is that she were here

1536
01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:16,910
to witness the discovery of her son.

1537
01:30:16,910 --> 01:30:18,263
- Thank you Mr. Whitaker.

1538
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:22,923
No further questions, Your Honor.

1539
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:30,410
- Mr. Whitaker.

1540
01:30:30,410 --> 01:30:33,360
Please forgive me, but
my feet are killing me.

1541
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,400
- Whatever makes you
comfortable, Counselor.

1542
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:36,233
- Thank you.

1543
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:42,010
So after nine years,
you finally found him.

1544
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:43,320
What took so long?

1545
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,560
- Your client remained anonymous.

1546
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,530
So we had no trail, no names,

1547
01:30:47,530 --> 01:30:49,610
nothing to even begin on.

1548
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:52,230
He could've been
anywhere, for all we knew.

1549
01:30:52,230 --> 01:30:54,470
And after a few years of
running around in circles,

1550
01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:56,023
Valerie started to lose hope.

1551
01:30:56,870 --> 01:31:00,470
That's when she turned her
attention to helping others.

1552
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:01,890
- That's admirable.

1553
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:03,090
- My daughter desperately tried

1554
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:04,600
to make up for what she'd done.

1555
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:06,000
- Sure.

1556
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,420
So when Valerie came home
after serving time in prison,

1557
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:12,120
what was it that caused
you to take her back in?

1558
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:13,870
- She expressed how sorry she was,

1559
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:16,240
and her willingness to
change for the better.

1560
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,790
So my wife and I decided
to support her endeavors

1561
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:21,190
to campaign, in particular.

1562
01:31:21,190 --> 01:31:23,810
- Were there any
conditions to your support?

1563
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:26,170
Like there were when you threw her

1564
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:27,510
out of your home years earlier?

1565
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:28,710
- Nothing inordinate.

1566
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:30,840
But she had to abstain from drug use

1567
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,486
and adhere to the rules of our home.

1568
01:31:33,486 --> 01:31:35,580
- But now I'm a little
confused on that, Mr. Whitaker.

1569
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:37,290
Forgive me, but can you tell me

1570
01:31:37,290 --> 01:31:39,510
what it was that Valerie actually did

1571
01:31:39,510 --> 01:31:41,630
at the age of 17 that caused you

1572
01:31:41,630 --> 01:31:43,350
to put her out of your home?

1573
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:45,143
- That was nearly 20 years ago.

1574
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:47,173
I don't remember.

1575
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:49,890
- You make your only child leave

1576
01:31:49,890 --> 01:31:51,670
the comfort of her own home,

1577
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:54,250
and you don't remember
what she did to deserve it?

1578
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:58,160
- Let's just say that Valerie had issues

1579
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:00,150
long before they became public.

1580
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:03,230
- God forbid any 17 year
old girl have issues.

1581
01:32:03,230 --> 01:32:04,550
- Objection.

1582
01:32:04,550 --> 01:32:07,830
Your Honor, I don't see what any of this

1583
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:10,890
has to do with the case?

1584
01:32:10,890 --> 01:32:12,500
- Overruled.

1585
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:13,900
State your point, Counselor.

1586
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:18,160
- I guess my concern is

1587
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:21,300
is you intend to seek custody
of my client's son, correct?

1588
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:24,820
- We intend to seek
custody of our grandson.

1589
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:26,040
That is correct.

1590
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,920
- And if by some random act of God,

1591
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:30,500
you were given custody of Brian Stewart,

1592
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,340
how do I know you wouldn't
throw him outta your home

1593
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:34,330
onto the street like you
did your own daughter?

1594
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:35,850
- My family's disciplinary methods

1595
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:37,210
are not on the stand, Counselor,

1596
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:40,030
and neither, for that matter, is Valerie.

1597
01:32:40,030 --> 01:32:42,360
Now my wife and I are here for one reason

1598
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,700
and one reason alone and that is to repair

1599
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:48,283
a broken relationship that
we had no hand in destroying.

1600
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,550
Now my daughter started this campaign

1601
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:54,560
in the hope that one day, she
would reunite with her son

1602
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:58,138
and by God, even in her
absence, we intend to finish it.

1603
01:32:58,138 --> 01:33:01,055
(melancholy music)

1604
01:33:02,063 --> 01:33:03,863
- Just watch your step.

1605
01:33:03,863 --> 01:33:04,960
Whatever you do, just keep moving.

1606
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,710
Don't talk to anyone.

1607
01:33:10,026 --> 01:33:11,609
- Brace yourselves.

1608
01:33:13,430 --> 01:33:14,494
- Back away from here.
- There's Brian!

1609
01:33:14,494 --> 01:33:19,494
Hi Brian!
(reporters yelling)

1610
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:13,660
- How long was I out?

1611
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,433
- About three hours, ya hungry?

1612
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:23,293
You haven't eaten all day, are you sure?

1613
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:27,933
What's wrong?

1614
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:33,893
- I've never seen Brian
that scared before.

1615
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:37,510
- He was surprised, and I,

1616
01:34:38,490 --> 01:34:40,870
we all were at the size of the crowd

1617
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:43,240
outside that courthouse, you know?

1618
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,023
- But I'm responsible for it.

1619
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:49,270
So I've been thinking,

1620
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:51,863
it might be best if you
and Brian went back home.

1621
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:00,070
- We're potential witnesses.

1622
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:02,700
And you know Brian can't leave

1623
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,350
the state until after the hearing.

1624
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:07,933
- If we win, otherwise
he's not going anywhere.

1625
01:35:10,284 --> 01:35:12,330
I just, I just don't know anymore.

1626
01:35:12,330 --> 01:35:14,580
I just don't know, maybe
it was all a mistake.

1627
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:15,747
I mean--
- Shh.

1628
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:18,860
(Audrey sobbing)
Just calm down, okay?

1629
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:20,227
You're overwhelmed.

1630
01:35:20,227 --> 01:35:22,227
It's gonna be all right.

1631
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:27,100
- How could I know

1632
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,637
that I did the right thing for Brian?

1633
01:35:33,056 --> 01:35:35,128
- Because he's loved,

1634
01:35:35,128 --> 01:35:37,128
so deeply by both of us.

1635
01:35:41,883 --> 01:35:44,040
- I don't wanna lose him, Carrie.

1636
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:45,623
- Neither do I hun.

1637
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,277
- That's all right?
- Yeah.

1638
01:35:58,277 --> 01:35:59,874
- Should we get pizza again?

1639
01:35:59,874 --> 01:36:00,880
(door clicking)
- Hey.

1640
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,770
There's been a slight change in plans.

1641
01:36:02,770 --> 01:36:03,603
- How?

1642
01:36:03,603 --> 01:36:04,910
- Well the prosecution doesn't wanna drag

1643
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:06,970
this thing out any
longer than they have to,

1644
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:08,460
and they've presented enough evidence

1645
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:09,590
to wrap things up today.

1646
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:12,270
So Carrie doesn't have to testify.

1647
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:15,390
However, they wanna cross-examine Brian.

1648
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:16,430
- Why?

1649
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:20,440
- I don't know, to find any
kinks in your parenting skills,

1650
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:22,350
anything that proves you're unfit.

1651
01:36:22,350 --> 01:36:23,860
- Well I don't think he's ready.

1652
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:25,690
- I don't think we have much of a choice.

1653
01:36:25,690 --> 01:36:27,660
Whether he goes up or not,

1654
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:30,743
your future is being determined today.

1655
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:35,093
- Mom,

1656
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:37,563
we prepared for this.

1657
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:39,703
I'm all right, really.

1658
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,310
- I'll see you at the
table in half an hour.

1659
01:36:44,310 --> 01:36:45,453
You sir, come with me.

1660
01:36:51,361 --> 01:36:54,740
(door clicks)
- He'll be fine.

1661
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:55,810
- You okay up there?

1662
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:56,680
- [Brian] Yes.

1663
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:57,730
- Good.

1664
01:36:57,730 --> 01:36:59,170
Obviously you know why you're here today.

1665
01:36:59,170 --> 01:37:00,003
- Yes.

1666
01:37:01,010 --> 01:37:03,010
- So why don't you start by telling us

1667
01:37:03,010 --> 01:37:04,270
a little bit about your mother.

1668
01:37:04,270 --> 01:37:07,390
Is she good at being a
mother, to start with?

1669
01:37:07,390 --> 01:37:09,810
- Yeah, she's great at it.

1670
01:37:09,810 --> 01:37:10,780
- How so?

1671
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:13,582
- The fact that she takes
so much pride in it,

1672
01:37:13,582 --> 01:37:16,580
and I know that there isn't
anything she wouldn't do for me.

1673
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:19,190
Plus she's a little more
intense that other moms I know,

1674
01:37:19,190 --> 01:37:21,830
so that makes things interesting.

1675
01:37:21,830 --> 01:37:23,160
- How do you mean?

1676
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:27,083
- Well she is really
supportive, like extremely.

1677
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:31,120
She has to be involved in everything I do,

1678
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:32,620
which is all right I guess.

1679
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:35,260
But sometimes I prefer she not be.

1680
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:37,400
- Sounds like a typical
plea of a teenager.

1681
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:40,950
So other than being a highly
involved, devoted parent,

1682
01:37:40,950 --> 01:37:42,920
she's pretty great at what she does.

1683
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:44,770
- [Brian] Absolutely.

1684
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:46,680
- When did she tell you
about Valerie Whitaker?

1685
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:48,370
- It was about two months ago.

1686
01:37:48,370 --> 01:37:50,160
One morning I noticed she had been crying,

1687
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:51,650
so I asked what was wrong.

1688
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:53,270
That's when she explained everything.

1689
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:55,273
- And how did that make you feel?

1690
01:37:55,273 --> 01:37:56,800
- I was kinda angry at first,

1691
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:59,980
but then I started to
understand why she did it.

1692
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:02,380
- And today, how do you
feel about what she did?

1693
01:38:04,032 --> 01:38:05,132
- I'm grateful for it.

1694
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:07,960
- No further questions, Your Honor.

1695
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:14,540
- Before the morning when you learned

1696
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:16,800
you had been purchased by the defendant,

1697
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:19,723
have you ever heard of Valerie Whitaker?

1698
01:38:20,730 --> 01:38:21,890
- No sir.

1699
01:38:21,890 --> 01:38:25,230
- In 15 years, did you
ever ask the defendant

1700
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:27,343
about your biological parents?

1701
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:29,510
- No sir.

1702
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:30,510
- [Richard] Why not?

1703
01:38:32,226 --> 01:38:34,176
- I just never really thought about it.

1704
01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:37,320
- But surely, there must
have been a conversation

1705
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:42,150
with the defendant about how
she became your guardian?

1706
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:43,420
- Sure.

1707
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:45,520
When she told me I was adopted.

1708
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:47,640
- So you never desired to know more

1709
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:50,413
about your biological parents.

1710
01:38:51,470 --> 01:38:52,430
- No sir.

1711
01:38:52,430 --> 01:38:55,293
- When you learned about
your biological mother,

1712
01:38:56,220 --> 01:38:59,290
did you do any research on your own?

1713
01:38:59,290 --> 01:39:01,510
- Some, over the internet.

1714
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:03,460
- What did you come across?

1715
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:04,990
- Mostly television interviews

1716
01:39:04,990 --> 01:39:07,000
and articles about her campaign.

1717
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,530
- And you do realize, her campaign

1718
01:39:09,530 --> 01:39:12,150
was established to find you.

1719
01:39:12,150 --> 01:39:13,270
- I guess.

1720
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:15,610
- In fact, your
grandparents spent a fortune

1721
01:39:15,610 --> 01:39:17,110
trying to hire people--
- Objection, Your Honor.

1722
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:19,250
The Whitaker's campaign expenses

1723
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:20,740
have no bearing on this case.

1724
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:21,800
- [Judge] Sustained.

1725
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:23,870
Keep it relevant, Counselor.

1726
01:39:23,870 --> 01:39:24,850
- Yes, Your Honor.

1727
01:39:24,850 --> 01:39:29,850
Now you talked about these
video interviews you looked at.

1728
01:39:31,762 --> 01:39:35,970
Did you notice the resemblance
between the two of you?

1729
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:40,020
- No sir, I never really noticed.

1730
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:42,583
- Well you do favor her a great deal.

1731
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:46,210
And it's unfortunate you only learned

1732
01:39:46,210 --> 01:39:49,170
about her brief stint of drug abuse.

1733
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:53,130
Aside from that, she was
a very intelligent woman.

1734
01:39:53,130 --> 01:39:57,593
In fact, she excelled
academically, just like yourself.

1735
01:39:58,820 --> 01:39:59,720
Did you know that?

1736
01:40:01,006 --> 01:40:02,650
- No sir.

1737
01:40:02,650 --> 01:40:04,660
- Yet you have the confidence to say

1738
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:06,533
your life was better off without her.

1739
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:09,169
- I didn't say that.

1740
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:13,050
- Didn't you just tell
us you were grateful

1741
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:15,330
to the defendant for abducting you?

1742
01:40:15,330 --> 01:40:16,980
- [Blythe] Objection, Your Honor.

1743
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:19,600
- I'll rephrase the question.

1744
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:22,950
Didn't you just tell us

1745
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:26,680
that you were grateful to the defendant

1746
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:27,993
for what she had done?

1747
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:30,343
- Yes sir.

1748
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:34,743
- You do realize that you
were a part of a transaction,

1749
01:40:35,730 --> 01:40:38,130
meaning that the defendant purchased you

1750
01:40:38,130 --> 01:40:40,710
like a product in a convenience store--

1751
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:42,650
- Objection, Your Honor.

1752
01:40:42,650 --> 01:40:44,290
- [Judge] Overruled.

1753
01:40:44,290 --> 01:40:45,863
Answer the question please.

1754
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:52,090
- I guess.

1755
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:54,610
- So even though you never knew

1756
01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:57,630
your biological mother at all,

1757
01:40:57,630 --> 01:40:59,450
you still have the confidence to say

1758
01:40:59,450 --> 01:41:01,743
your life was better
off with the defendant?

1759
01:41:03,167 --> 01:41:04,000
- I'm not sure.

1760
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:04,833
- No?

1761
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,950
But you just led us to believe

1762
01:41:07,950 --> 01:41:09,773
that everything was perfect, right?

1763
01:41:10,730 --> 01:41:12,860
I mean, I find it a little strange

1764
01:41:12,860 --> 01:41:15,200
that the defendant didn't tell you

1765
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:17,450
about all this until recently.

1766
01:41:17,450 --> 01:41:20,550
The way you've described
her, she sounds honest,

1767
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:23,420
forthright, that is
your impression of her,

1768
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:24,700
is it not?

1769
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:26,170
- Yes sir.

1770
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:27,950
- So why do you think she would wait

1771
01:41:27,950 --> 01:41:31,710
until the situation became inescapable

1772
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:33,480
before ever revealing the truth?

1773
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:36,200
Could it be she's been hiding
something from you all along?

1774
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:37,880
- Objection, Your Honor.

1775
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:39,650
The prosecution is leading the witness.

1776
01:41:39,650 --> 01:41:40,700
- [Judge] Sustained.

1777
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:42,650
You need to rephrase, Counselor.

1778
01:41:42,650 --> 01:41:44,330
- Yes, Your Honor.

1779
01:41:44,330 --> 01:41:46,322
Doesn't it bother you at all

1780
01:41:46,322 --> 01:41:49,900
that the defendant forged
your mother's signature

1781
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:51,370
on those adoption forms?

1782
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:52,230
- Objection, Your Honor.

1783
01:41:52,230 --> 01:41:54,730
He's badgering the witness.

1784
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:56,330
Fucking asshole.

1785
01:41:56,330 --> 01:41:58,303
- Counselor, approach the bench.

1786
01:42:05,030 --> 01:42:08,363
You are walking a very fine line.

1787
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,390
One more outburst like that,

1788
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:13,870
and I will hold you in contempt.

1789
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:17,380
Do I make myself perfectly clear?

1790
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:18,280
- Yes, Your Honor.

1791
01:42:22,490 --> 01:42:24,480
- You may proceed, Counselor.

1792
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,657
- No further questions, Your Honor.

1793
01:42:26,657 --> 01:42:29,690
(somber music)

1794
01:42:29,690 --> 01:42:30,690
- You may step down.

1795
01:42:32,782 --> 01:42:33,782
- Follow me.

1796
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:51,033
- [Judge] Counselor.

1797
01:42:51,033 --> 01:42:53,180
- I'd like to call Audrey
Stewart to the stand.

1798
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:09,060
- And please remain standing.

1799
01:43:09,060 --> 01:43:10,160
Raise your right hand.

1800
01:43:11,290 --> 01:43:12,840
Do you solemnly swear the testimony

1801
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:14,660
you're about to give in
this court now on trial

1802
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:16,290
will be the truth, the whole truth,

1803
01:43:16,290 --> 01:43:18,410
and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?

1804
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:19,243
- Yes.

1805
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:21,503
- [Bailiff] You may be seated.

1806
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:28,290
- Would you state your
name for the record please.

1807
01:43:28,290 --> 01:43:29,520
- Audrey Stewart.

1808
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:32,020
- Mrs. Stewart, how long were you employed

1809
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:34,760
as a registered nurse
at St. Gregory Hospital?

1810
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:35,593
- Three years.

1811
01:43:35,593 --> 01:43:37,060
- And will you tell us what happened

1812
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:40,003
on the evening of July 17, 1997?

1813
01:43:40,890 --> 01:43:42,700
- That's the night that Valerie Whitaker

1814
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:44,940
was rushed to the emergency room.

1815
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:46,040
- Was anyone with her?

1816
01:43:46,930 --> 01:43:48,120
- No.

1817
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:51,880
According to the medic, the
911 call came from a passerby

1818
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:54,730
who found her laying
facedown on the sidewalk.

1819
01:43:54,730 --> 01:43:56,260
And to the hospital's knowledge,

1820
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:58,200
there was no family, no home,

1821
01:43:58,200 --> 01:43:59,860
and judging by her appearance,

1822
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:01,800
she'd spent some time on the street.

1823
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,500
- And according to hospital records,

1824
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:05,840
the pregnancy was discovered as the doctor

1825
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,950
was preparing her for detox.

1826
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:09,130
- Yes.

1827
01:44:09,130 --> 01:44:10,377
If he hadn't examined her first,

1828
01:44:10,377 --> 01:44:13,020
there was a possibility
the baby would've died

1829
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:15,840
due to complications from the procedure.

1830
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,840
- What measures were taken at that time?

1831
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:21,650
- The hospital contacted
Human Services right away.

1832
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:23,880
- And what did Human Services do?

1833
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:26,010
- What they normally do, I suppose.

1834
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:28,453
Background checks, and
things of that nature.

1835
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:31,800
- Obviously, the kid turned out okay.

1836
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:35,370
But were there any problems
initially, after he was born?

1837
01:44:35,370 --> 01:44:38,973
- Other than him being highly sedated, no.

1838
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,320
But it really was a miracle.

1839
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:46,240
The entire hospital staff fell
in love with him immediately,

1840
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:48,180
and everyone really wanted Valerie

1841
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:51,780
to make a full recovery so she
could take care of her son.

1842
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:54,333
And that appeared to be
what she wanted to do.

1843
01:44:55,220 --> 01:44:56,400
- So what was it that caused you

1844
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:58,323
to believe she had other intentions?

1845
01:45:00,510 --> 01:45:02,140
- I went to go check on her one night,

1846
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:04,600
and I overheard a phone call

1847
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:08,203
between her and a pimp, I assume.

1848
01:45:09,450 --> 01:45:11,630
And they were planning on selling her baby

1849
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:14,120
the day she was discharged
from the hospital.

1850
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:15,940
- And Child Services?

1851
01:45:15,940 --> 01:45:17,040
- They looked into it.

1852
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,210
But Valerie denied the whole thing,

1853
01:45:20,210 --> 01:45:23,090
and she had spent more than
enough time in the hospital

1854
01:45:23,090 --> 01:45:26,010
to have made a full recovery
without withdrawals,

1855
01:45:26,010 --> 01:45:28,440
so at that point, there was
nothing more Child Services

1856
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,080
could do other than let her go

1857
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:32,650
and set up a follow-up for a later date.

1858
01:45:32,650 --> 01:45:36,410
- So how did the whole
transaction take place?

1859
01:45:36,410 --> 01:45:39,300
- About a week passed,

1860
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:41,703
and I started to worry about the baby.

1861
01:45:43,090 --> 01:45:46,040
So I looked at Valerie's private records

1862
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:47,480
and I found her number,

1863
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:50,840
and decided to make an
anonymous phone call.

1864
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:53,420
- And did she pick up right away?

1865
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:54,253
- Yes.

1866
01:45:55,290 --> 01:45:57,370
But at first, she was very skeptical,

1867
01:45:57,370 --> 01:46:00,940
so I had to assure her
I wasn't with any agency

1868
01:46:00,940 --> 01:46:04,450
and that I just wanted
to purchase the child.

1869
01:46:04,450 --> 01:46:06,933
- Did she ever insist on an amount?

1870
01:46:08,090 --> 01:46:10,290
- She wanted $5,000

1871
01:46:10,290 --> 01:46:12,260
but I didn't have that
kind of money at the time,

1872
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:13,910
so I offered her half.

1873
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:15,633
- And obviously, she accepted.

1874
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,710
Were there any other conditions?

1875
01:46:19,710 --> 01:46:21,250
- Her only condition was that

1876
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:23,740
the transaction remain anonymous,

1877
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:25,190
which I assured her it would.

1878
01:46:26,770 --> 01:46:29,300
But for my safety, I
insisted that she bring

1879
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:33,340
the hospital records
and sign adoption forms,

1880
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:34,543
which she agreed to.

1881
01:46:35,610 --> 01:46:38,200
- In order to keep the
transaction anonymous,

1882
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:39,890
what measures did you take?

1883
01:46:39,890 --> 01:46:42,280
- Well I suggested that she leave the baby

1884
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:45,270
at the top of the steps
of St. Mark Cathedral,

1885
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:46,500
where she could pick up the money

1886
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,540
and sign the adoption form.

1887
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:53,240
- So she left the baby, took the money,

1888
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:57,040
and drove away without signing the forms?

1889
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:58,200
- Yes.

1890
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:01,370
But she did leave the
original hospital records.

1891
01:47:01,370 --> 01:47:03,660
- So the only thing you were missing

1892
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:05,643
was the signature of Valerie Whitaker.

1893
01:47:08,950 --> 01:47:11,270
- And I knew that in order to provide

1894
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:12,870
a proper life for the baby,

1895
01:47:12,870 --> 01:47:14,793
I had to have those forms signed.

1896
01:47:16,570 --> 01:47:18,320
- No further questions, Your Honor.

1897
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:23,563
- Mrs. Stewart.

1898
01:47:24,830 --> 01:47:26,710
I find it very hard to believe

1899
01:47:26,710 --> 01:47:31,080
that Valerie would leave the
child's original birth records

1900
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:34,453
and not sign the adoption
forms you say you left.

1901
01:47:35,390 --> 01:47:37,880
Why do you think she would do that?

1902
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:39,090
- I don't know.

1903
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:41,078
She appeared to be in a rush.

1904
01:47:41,078 --> 01:47:42,640
- A rush, huh.

1905
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:46,150
Or could it be never really left any forms

1906
01:47:46,150 --> 01:47:48,128
for her to sign at all.

1907
01:47:48,128 --> 01:47:50,080
- I never would have
agreed to the arrangement

1908
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,840
if I thought she wasn't
gonna sign the forms.

1909
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:55,620
- So in all sincerity, you feel
like you did the right thing

1910
01:47:55,620 --> 01:48:00,620
by forging Valerie's signature
to those adoption forms.

1911
01:48:00,730 --> 01:48:02,533
- I had her verbal consent,

1912
01:48:03,630 --> 01:48:06,450
and the original hospital birth records.

1913
01:48:06,450 --> 01:48:09,730
- Okay, so why did you flee Boston

1914
01:48:10,848 --> 01:48:12,543
and relocate to Chicago?

1915
01:48:13,810 --> 01:48:17,410
- I didn't flee Boston, I left.

1916
01:48:17,410 --> 01:48:20,070
I went back to Chicago, my original home

1917
01:48:20,070 --> 01:48:21,670
where I knew I could start over.

1918
01:48:22,690 --> 01:48:24,855
- So it had nothing to do with the fact

1919
01:48:24,855 --> 01:48:28,453
you had illegally purchased
a child in this city?

1920
01:48:29,690 --> 01:48:31,520
- It would have been
difficult to raise him here

1921
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:33,573
considering everything that had happened.

1922
01:48:34,690 --> 01:48:35,523
- Naturally.

1923
01:48:36,630 --> 01:48:38,680
But the biggest question still remains.

1924
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:40,720
Why didn't you come forward

1925
01:48:41,680 --> 01:48:44,250
after all these years?

1926
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:45,083
Hmm?

1927
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:47,923
Mrs. Stewart?

1928
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:52,060
- I didn't know that
Valerie was looking for him.

1929
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:53,720
- So you expect us to believe

1930
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:57,790
that after 12 years of
televised interviews

1931
01:48:57,790 --> 01:49:01,400
with Valerie including the segment

1932
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:04,480
produced by the network your wife

1933
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:06,400
is currently employed with,

1934
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:09,010
that you were completely oblivious

1935
01:49:09,010 --> 01:49:12,194
to the Whitaker's search
for Valerie's son?

1936
01:49:12,194 --> 01:49:16,107
- I didn't know that
Valerie was looking for him.

1937
01:49:16,107 --> 01:49:17,460
- All right.

1938
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:20,340
So let's go back further than that.

1939
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:24,130
After you picked up the
baby from the church,

1940
01:49:24,130 --> 01:49:27,023
why didn't ya just take
him to Child Services?

1941
01:49:28,170 --> 01:49:30,510
- 'Cause I didn't trust
that he'd be any better off

1942
01:49:30,510 --> 01:49:31,833
under their provision.

1943
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:35,150
- But you do realize,
you were required by law

1944
01:49:35,150 --> 01:49:38,563
to inform Child Services in
a case like that, correct?

1945
01:49:40,410 --> 01:49:42,580
- As I just said, I didn't trust

1946
01:49:42,580 --> 01:49:45,690
that he would be any
better off in the system.

1947
01:49:45,690 --> 01:49:47,870
- So in other words,
you went above the law

1948
01:49:47,870 --> 01:49:50,740
and made that decision for him.

1949
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:52,190
- Yes.

1950
01:49:52,190 --> 01:49:54,423
And I wouldn't do it
any differently today.

1951
01:49:56,160 --> 01:49:57,960
- That's a strong statement, Mrs. Stewart

1952
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:02,570
given that every system is
imperfect in its own way.

1953
01:50:02,570 --> 01:50:05,100
I mean, it doesn't work for all children,

1954
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:06,859
but it does work for many.

1955
01:50:06,859 --> 01:50:08,442
Wouldn't you agree?

1956
01:50:10,095 --> 01:50:12,570
- I don't believe that any child belongs

1957
01:50:12,570 --> 01:50:13,913
in a fallible system.

1958
01:50:16,409 --> 01:50:19,920
- So it appears you've
developed some contempt

1959
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:24,920
for a system and services
that provide assistance

1960
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:27,143
for neglected children?

1961
01:50:28,570 --> 01:50:30,160
Now why is that?

1962
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:31,670
- I know that there are people

1963
01:50:31,670 --> 01:50:34,363
who really do care for neglected children,

1964
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:40,300
but as a nurse, I've seen the
system fail too many of them.

1965
01:50:42,930 --> 01:50:44,963
- Including yourself, right?

1966
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:49,550
You too were a product of that system,

1967
01:50:49,550 --> 01:50:50,850
weren't you, Mrs. Stewart?

1968
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:53,633
- Yes.

1969
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:59,363
- And according to your own legal records,

1970
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:05,023
you were abused by your
foster parents, weren't you?

1971
01:51:08,110 --> 01:51:10,480
I have here a statement that you gave

1972
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:12,720
to the Boston police on the evening

1973
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:15,310
of March 12th, 1985.

1974
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:16,513
There's photos too.

1975
01:51:18,810 --> 01:51:21,590
Apparently you had just run away from home

1976
01:51:21,590 --> 01:51:24,173
after being beat by your foster father.

1977
01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:28,967
It reads, "He hits me all the time.

1978
01:51:28,967 --> 01:51:31,677
"Every morning when he
gets home from work,

1979
01:51:31,677 --> 01:51:35,237
"but if I am up and
ready to go before seven,

1980
01:51:35,237 --> 01:51:36,967
"I can avoid him."

1981
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:41,740
And when asked whether your mother permits

1982
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:44,083
your father to hit you, you replied,

1983
01:51:45,957 --> 01:51:47,447
"Yes.

1984
01:51:47,447 --> 01:51:48,577
"She hits me too."

1985
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:54,327
Was that not your statement, Mrs. Stewart?

1986
01:51:54,327 --> 01:51:55,160
- It was.

1987
01:51:56,577 --> 01:51:58,693
- [Richard] And how old
were you at that time?

1988
01:52:00,090 --> 01:52:00,923
- 14.

1989
01:52:06,130 --> 01:52:11,130
- So apparently, you've
allowed your own experiences

1990
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:14,563
to tarnish your perception of the system.

1991
01:52:15,610 --> 01:52:18,550
- Anyone's perception
would've been tarnished

1992
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:19,913
by my experience.

1993
01:52:22,210 --> 01:52:27,210
But that has no bearing on
my decision to adopt Brian.

1994
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:32,030
If I hadn't laid aside my past,

1995
01:52:32,030 --> 01:52:34,320
I would have been no good to him.

1996
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:37,540
Every newborn child deserves a chance,

1997
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:40,193
and I knew that I could
provide that for that baby.

1998
01:52:43,830 --> 01:52:46,370
- Perhaps, but statistics show

1999
01:52:46,370 --> 01:52:49,980
that nearly a fourth
of all abused children

2000
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:53,510
later grow up to abuse their own children.

2001
01:52:53,510 --> 01:52:58,196
Now I'm certain that's not the
case with you, Mrs. Stewart,

2002
01:52:58,196 --> 01:53:01,553
but is that a risk the
law should willingly take?

2003
01:53:03,423 --> 01:53:04,650
No.

2004
01:53:04,650 --> 01:53:07,573
Now I don't think so, Mrs. Stewart.

2005
01:53:08,910 --> 01:53:13,260
That's why you were required by law,

2006
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:14,883
a certified nurse,

2007
01:53:17,170 --> 01:53:19,033
to inform Child Services.

2008
01:53:21,848 --> 01:53:23,643
No further questions, Your Honor.

2009
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,840
- [Judge] Counselor, would
you like the opportunity

2010
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:32,213
to redirect your witness?

2011
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:35,923
- No further questions, Your Honor.

2012
01:53:35,923 --> 01:53:38,840
(melancholy music)

2013
01:53:47,964 --> 01:53:50,770
(people chattering quietly)

2014
01:53:50,770 --> 01:53:52,540
- [Bailiff] All rise.

2015
01:53:52,540 --> 01:53:54,460
The U.S. District Court is now in session,

2016
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:56,340
Judge Pilsen presiding.

2017
01:53:56,340 --> 01:53:57,303
Please be seated.

2018
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,570
- I understand the jury
has come to a verdict.

2019
01:54:05,570 --> 01:54:07,323
- [Head Juror] Yes we have, Your Honor.

2020
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:12,270
- [Judge] Will the defendant please rise?

2021
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:15,313
Step forward please.

2022
01:54:19,490 --> 01:54:21,960
- In the case of the U.S.
District of Massachusetts

2023
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:23,920
versus Audrey Stewart,

2024
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:27,693
the jury finds the defendant
not guilty of illegal adoption.

2025
01:54:28,910 --> 01:54:31,390
And for the second count
of child abduction,

2026
01:54:31,390 --> 01:54:33,513
we find the defendant guilty.

2027
01:54:36,115 --> 01:54:37,640
- I'm so sorry.
- Sentencing will be scheduled

2028
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:39,260
for one week from today.

2029
01:54:39,260 --> 01:54:40,360
As for Brian Stewart,

2030
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:42,980
he will remain in the
state of Massachusetts

2031
01:54:42,980 --> 01:54:46,010
under the supervision of
Child Protective Services

2032
01:54:46,010 --> 01:54:51,010
until the age of 18, or legal
guardianship is attained.

2033
01:54:51,202 --> 01:54:52,756
(gavel banging)
This court is adjourned.

2034
01:54:52,756 --> 01:54:55,673
(melancholy music)

2035
01:55:14,292 --> 01:55:16,792
- How long is this gonna take?

2036
01:55:17,638 --> 01:55:18,888
- I don't know.

2037
01:55:20,836 --> 01:55:22,186
It shouldn't take too long.

2038
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:33,000
- Brian Stewart, come with me.

2039
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:33,833
You're being placed in protective custody.

2040
01:55:33,833 --> 01:55:36,103
- Look, you talk to me, not my son.

2041
01:55:37,022 --> 01:55:38,130
- I'm sorry, come with me.

2042
01:55:38,130 --> 01:55:39,506
- No, get your hands off my son.

2043
01:55:39,506 --> 01:55:40,993
- Ma'am, ma'am, calm down.

2044
01:55:40,993 --> 01:55:42,246
- Get your hands off my son!

2045
01:55:42,246 --> 01:55:43,981
- Calm down--
- Why are they taking my son?

2046
01:55:43,981 --> 01:55:45,550
- [Officer] Calm down.

2047
01:55:45,550 --> 01:55:48,000
- Blythe, stop them they're
trying to take Brian.

2048
01:55:49,953 --> 01:55:52,620
(tearfully) No!

2049
01:55:53,953 --> 01:55:55,729
No! (sobbing)

2050
01:55:55,729 --> 01:55:56,562
No!

2051
01:55:58,614 --> 01:56:02,281
(people chattering quietly)

2052
01:56:06,848 --> 01:56:08,156
- Back away folks, back away.

2053
01:56:08,156 --> 01:56:08,989
(reporters chattering)

2054
01:56:08,989 --> 01:56:10,566
Move back that way.

2055
01:56:10,566 --> 01:56:11,399
Back away!

2056
01:56:14,273 --> 01:56:15,481
Step back--

2057
01:56:15,481 --> 01:56:16,314
- Blythe!

2058
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:23,526
- Move back away, get out of the way.

2059
01:56:23,526 --> 01:56:24,804
Get out of the, back up.

2060
01:56:24,804 --> 01:56:26,464
Out of the way.

2061
01:56:26,464 --> 01:56:27,981
Back away folks.

2062
01:56:27,981 --> 01:56:28,814
Back away.

2063
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:43,377
(elevator dinging)

2064
01:59:34,662 --> 01:59:37,412
(birds chirping)

2065
01:59:45,248 --> 01:59:49,103
(woman speaking over loudspeaker)

2066
01:59:49,103 --> 01:59:52,520
(door clangs and buzzes)

2067
01:59:55,849 --> 01:59:58,516
(keys clanging)

2068
01:59:59,818 --> 02:00:01,257
(man speaking over loudspeaker)

2069
02:00:01,257 --> 02:00:04,007
(buzzer buzzing)

2070
02:00:28,271 --> 02:00:29,104
- How?

2071
02:00:30,194 --> 02:00:32,861
(Carrie laughs)

2072
02:00:41,131 --> 02:00:42,889
(Audrey laughs)

2073
02:00:42,889 --> 02:00:46,829
(woman speaking over loudspeaker)

2074
02:00:46,829 --> 02:00:49,108
That's wonderful! (laughs)

2075
02:00:49,108 --> 02:00:50,790
- I thought you'd be happy.

2076
02:00:50,790 --> 02:00:53,540
(buzzer buzzing)

2077
02:00:55,507 --> 02:00:58,674
- He doesn't, he doesn't know how yet?

2078
02:01:03,563 --> 02:01:05,646
What about the Whitakers?

2079
02:01:07,518 --> 02:01:09,143
- It's been hard.

2080
02:01:09,143 --> 02:01:11,335
Working on setting up
a formal introduction

2081
02:01:11,335 --> 02:01:13,807
with Brian and them.

2082
02:01:13,807 --> 02:01:15,396
- Okay.

2083
02:01:15,396 --> 02:01:16,229
- Deal?

2084
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:18,820
- He should know his grandparents.

2085
02:01:20,770 --> 02:01:21,603
- All right.

2086
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:24,800
Same time next week?

2087
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:25,633
- Please.

2088
02:01:25,633 --> 02:01:27,683
(both laugh)

2089
02:01:27,683 --> 02:01:28,683
- Of course.

2090
02:01:29,650 --> 02:01:30,483
I love you.

2091
02:01:30,483 --> 02:01:31,316
- I love you too.

2092
02:01:36,596 --> 02:01:37,973
- Sweetie.

2093
02:01:37,973 --> 02:01:42,406
(man speaking over loudspeaker)

2094
02:01:42,406 --> 02:01:43,945
- Hi Mom.

2095
02:01:43,945 --> 02:01:46,112
- Hi sweetie, how are you?

2096
02:01:47,370 --> 02:01:48,670
(buzzer buzzing)

2097
02:01:48,670 --> 02:01:49,503
- Good.

2098
02:01:50,833 --> 02:01:52,308
Are you okay?

2099
02:01:52,308 --> 02:01:53,225
- I'm fine.

2100
02:01:55,960 --> 02:01:58,360
How's everything now that
you're back in school?

2101
02:02:00,055 --> 02:02:00,972
- Not good.

2102
02:02:02,131 --> 02:02:04,847
Principal Patterson
recommends I see a counselor.

2103
02:02:06,470 --> 02:02:08,258
- That's completely up to you sweetheart.

2104
02:02:08,258 --> 02:02:12,035
(woman speaking over loudspeaker)

2105
02:02:12,035 --> 02:02:15,057
- I'm sorry I couldn't defend you better.

2106
02:02:15,057 --> 02:02:16,770
- No. (laughs)

2107
02:02:16,770 --> 02:02:19,540
This is not your fault, you hear me?

2108
02:02:19,540 --> 02:02:21,950
You did a great job.

2109
02:02:21,950 --> 02:02:23,100
- [Officer] One minute.

2110
02:02:24,150 --> 02:02:26,485
- There's so much that I wanna say,

2111
02:02:26,485 --> 02:02:27,800
but I don't know how.

2112
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:30,270
- Okay, how about this,
how about you write

2113
02:02:30,270 --> 02:02:32,410
everything in a letter,
anything you wanna say,

2114
02:02:32,410 --> 02:02:33,257
it'll be okay.

2115
02:02:33,257 --> 02:02:34,803
And I'll write back, okay?

2116
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:37,683
- Yeah.

2117
02:02:39,603 --> 02:02:40,686
- I love you.

2118
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:45,593
- I love you too, Mom.

2119
02:02:47,124 --> 02:02:47,957
- Okay.

2120
02:02:47,957 --> 02:02:50,540
(gentle music)

2121
02:03:05,184 --> 02:03:09,105
- (taps on window) Mom!

2122
02:03:09,105 --> 02:03:11,875
(pounds on window)

2123
02:03:11,875 --> 02:03:14,708
- [Officer] Stewart, back in line.

2124
02:03:19,883 --> 02:03:22,216
- I'll see you soon sweetie.

2125
02:03:32,145 --> 02:03:34,711
- (pounds on window) Mom!

2126
02:03:34,711 --> 02:03:37,461
