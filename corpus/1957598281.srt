Voiceover: Growing up in the
city during the mid-1960s proved

3
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:04,844
to be quite challenging,
especially for my brother Jay Jay.

00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,365
(mellow music)

00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:11,858

to flash right before your eyes and you better
make sure it's something worth watching.

7
00:01:15,984 --> 00:01:21,247
He knew that there had to be more than just
working at a gas station to look forward to.

(soaring music)

10
00:03:38,781 --> 00:03:43,220
Voiceover: In the last one hundred years, waves
of newcomers to Alaska have challenged the land.

11
00:03:43,286 --> 00:03:47,841
The first newcomers that challenged the
land would be pioneers and mountain men

12
00:03:47,907 --> 00:03:55,907
seeking riches from the land in
the form of furs, timber and gold.

13
00:03:57,096 --> 00:03:59,257
It was a land of opportunity.

14
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,636
The country was shrinking
and there was a fortune

15
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:05,831
to be made up north for any
man with drive and ambition.

16
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:09,771
If your dream was big enough and
you had the guts to follow it,

17
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:16,789
there was truly a fortune to be made.

18
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:19,528
With the nation in the throes
of a serious depression,

19
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:24,554
my brother Jay Jay struck off northward
to the vast unknown reaches of Alaska,

20
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,542
bound to discover the mother
lode of all gold finds.

21
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:32,881
(gunshot sound)

22
00:04:32,947 --> 00:04:37,593

Voiceover: His journey started at the
Alaska coast, taking him over the mountains,

31
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:33,547
down a chain of lakes and rivers until reaching the
forks of the mighty Susitna and Talkeetna rivers.

32
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:40,260
Two hundred miles in 30 days, Jay Jay
reached the mountain range dominated

33
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:48,325
by a 20,000 foot mountain the native people
called Denali, meaning "the great one."

34
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:51,853
There was no doubt he had
reached his destination.

35
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,479
This was to be the gateway to
his dreams of striking it rich.

36
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,284
Here my brother Jay Jay decided to
settle down, and build an enormous cabin.

37
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,520
He married his childhood
sweetheart, and soon had four sons.

38
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:18,879
Over time, Jay Jay's wife, feeling
unfit to endure the wild land,

39
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:25,319
defeated by the vast reaches of space and
time, left Jay Jay and headed back to New York,

40
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:33,384
taking two of their four sons, leaving him alone
to care for the two youngest, Jeffrey and Joshua.

41
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:43,719

Voiceover: The railroad
opened up big Alaska,

44
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:12,945
punching into the uncharted virgin
wilderness once thought to be impossible.

45
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:19,931
It opened up vast sections of land to
homesteaders, free for the picking.

46
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:27,996
(majestic music)

47
00:08:32,702 --> 00:08:40,701
It was the beginning and the end of
imagination all at the same time.

48
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,803
My brother took this all in stride,

49
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:52,496
feeling a [unintelligible] and even bigger opportunities
of reaching further into the unknown wilderness.

50
00:08:52,562 --> 00:08:57,803

51
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:05,868
(majestic music)

52
00:09:27,545 --> 00:09:30,159
Voiceover: The railroad provided
a stable form of transportation

53
00:09:30,225 --> 00:09:35,434
along this primitive section of wilderness
rumored to be rich in both furs and gold.

54
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:47,256
My brother staked out several prime locations
in the small frontier town of Talkeetna

55
00:09:47,322 --> 00:09:49,708
which he considered his home base.

56
00:09:49,774 --> 00:09:52,624
It's a place where he was
well-known and respected.

57
00:09:52,690 --> 00:10:00,689
(majestic music)

58
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:16,312
Voiceover: Talkeetna sits on the
banks of three major river systems,

59
00:10:16,378 --> 00:10:24,377
providing both rail service
and riverboat access.

60
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:34,023
It happened on his annual supply run
to town, just before spring break-up.

61
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:38,058
He had a winter's worth of furs to be
sold and a supply list a mile long -

62
00:10:38,124 --> 00:10:42,810
thinks like flour, salt, sugar, peanut
butter, gunpowder and, of course,

63
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:48,484
all the grub a person's gonna need to
tide him over until the next season.

64
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,732
His dogsled was loaded, a bit
heavier than he would have liked.

65
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:56,585
Nonetheless, his dogs
were on fire, ready to go.

66
00:10:56,651 --> 00:11:03,893
(dogs barking)

67
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:07,502
Jay Jay: Ready?

Voiceover: What appeared to be a
grand day for travel soon developed

00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,302
into one of the worst
blizzards in Alaskan history,

71
00:11:23,368 --> 00:11:27,765
and little did he know he was on a
head-on collision course with it.

72
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:35,830
(majestic music)

73
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,087
Voiceover: As he gained elevation,
the wind and snow picked up.

74
00:11:44,153 --> 00:11:46,145
The wind was howling;
the snow was blinding.

75
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:50,796
Visibility was so bad, he
couldn't even see his lead dogs.

76
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:57,283
Soon, the mountain pass he was in was
impassable, but he kept pushing on.

77
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,583
(mellow music)

78
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:18,449
Voiceover: He drove himself and
his team of dogs into the unknown,

79
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:26,514
which would eventually lead him to his own
demise and, just like that, he was gone.

80
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:33,223
Within hours of Jay Jay's disappearance,
there was an emergency rescue called.

81
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:41,288
Emergency search-and-rescue teams from three
territories immediately set off to find my brother.

Voiceover: They set up a base camp in
the mountains he had last traveled.

86
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:16,016
Man in hat: Okay, great; thanks for putting
it together; we'll be expecting him.

87
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:22,571
It's a pretty dramatic [unintelligible], so I
want to get the pilots down into their spacing.

88
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:27,115
(helicopter propeller sounds)

Voiceover: Desperately searching both by air
and by dog teams, they had come up empty.

91
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:52,559
After several weeks of searching, they
reluctantly called off the search.

92
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:57,240
My brother had come to this wild
land wanting to claim it for himself,

93
00:13:57,306 --> 00:14:05,305
but it was the land, the sheer size and
extremes, that ended up claiming him.

94
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:16,457
(melancholic music)

95
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:43,478

immediately felt by the three sons in New York.

Voiceover: Joseph was in college when the news of
his father came, hitting him particularly hard.

100
00:15:31,315 --> 00:15:38,266
For him, leaving New York wasn't a
possibility, one he would have to live with.

101
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:42,571
He was devastated.

102
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:50,636

back from Alaska some years earlier,

104
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:07,591
left for Alaska immediately to deal with his father's
will and other issues involved with his death.

105
00:16:07,657 --> 00:16:13,092
He also was looking forward to seeing his youngest
brother, who he had always been so close to.

Man in jacket: Just take the
trail up there and head north.

112
00:17:56,064 --> 00:17:58,037
That'll take you right to it.

Joshua: Ah, thank you.

118
00:18:40,604 --> 00:18:44,039
So, where can a guy go to
get some sleep around here?

119
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:45,043
Woman: You need a room?

120
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:46,143
Joshua: Yeah.

121
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,395
Woman: Okay, you want the
roadhouse just down the street.

00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:50,023
Joshua: Oh, thank you.

123
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:51,682
So, is it true there's gold here?

(laughs quietly)

125
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:56,941
How long did it take you to dig this up?

the better part of this morning.

Joshua: What's your problem?

148
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,175
Didn't your mother teach you any manners?

149
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,376
Man #1: We're just having
some fun with the punk.

00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,655
Joshua: Yeah?

Good day.

157
00:20:55,096 --> 00:20:57,656
Good after noon, sir.

158
00:20:57,722 --> 00:21:00,352
Joshua: Good afternoon; the lady at the
Fairview said you might be able to help me.

159
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:01,729
I need a room.

160
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:03,053
Woman at desk: How very kind of her.

161
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:09,055
I do rent rooms, upstairs at the end of the
hall, $50 a night, if you're not permanent.

162
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:12,515
Joshua: Oh, I'm not permanent; I'm only
going to be here about a day or two.

163
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,269
Woman: Parlor's yours to
use; mind your volume.

164
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:20,421
Mind your volume; I do have other renters. They're staying
downstairs, two railroad workers and a schoolteacher.

165
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:26,691
Coffee's always on; mind
yourself on the stairs.

166
00:21:26,814 --> 00:21:31,223
The stairs are older than I
am, and I'm just as creaky.

167
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:36,647
Your room's this way, but this is
the bathroom right through here.

168
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,519
Joshua: Oh, I thought
that's what that was.

169
00:21:38,585 --> 00:21:40,568
Woman: I trust you know how it all works.

170
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,761
Joshua: I'm fairly certain.

171
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,435
Woman: And here's the room.

172
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:50,361
Watch your head; I do not
have time for a lawsuit.

173
00:21:50,427 --> 00:21:53,188
Joshua: This is very nice.

174
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:58,270
If you don't mind, I'll
take my meals in here.

175
00:21:58,336 --> 00:22:01,032
One more thing - what time
does the train leave tomorrow?

176
00:22:01,098 --> 00:22:03,685
Woman: You'll want to be
at the depot at 11:00.

177
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:05,771
It leaves at 11:20, heads north.

178
00:22:05,837 --> 00:22:07,406
Joshua: Thank you very much.

179
00:22:07,472 --> 00:22:14,110
(running water sound)

180
00:22:14,176 --> 00:22:15,140
(knocking sound)

181
00:22:15,206 --> 00:22:18,220
Voiceover: If you don't want to miss
that train, you better get moving.

182
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:20,018
Joshua: Thank you.

183
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:39,208
Voiceover: After a night at the roadhouse,
my nephew Joshua struck off with plans

184
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:43,506
of catching the train north
to his father's cabin,

185
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:47,254
one of the last cabins he
remembered before returning

186
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,545
to New York some years
before his father's death.

187
00:22:56,861 --> 00:22:59,502
Man: Hey, are you Joshua?

188
00:22:59,568 --> 00:23:02,503
We got a telegram.

189
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:06,646
Voiceover: My brother's youngest son
Jeffrey, aware of Joshua's return,

190
00:23:06,712 --> 00:23:13,709
sent him a telegram to meet him at the forks
of the two rivers just outside of town.

191
00:23:14,949 --> 00:23:20,127
(train whistle)

192
00:23:20,193 --> 00:23:22,226
Man #1: I think I see him
going down the alley right now.

193
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:24,540
Let's go follow him and see where he goes.

194
00:23:24,606 --> 00:23:27,439
(train whistles)

195
00:23:33,498 --> 00:23:41,498

(lively music)

197
00:23:57,753 --> 00:24:03,349
(sound of boat motor)

198
00:24:03,415 --> 00:24:06,395
(Joshua reacts to train whistle)

199
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:15,732
(resounding music)

200
00:24:31,784 --> 00:24:34,446
Man #1: Whoa, whoa, there he is.

201
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:38,607
Man #2: Yeah, bet he's
gonna meet with his brother.

202
00:24:38,673 --> 00:24:41,961
You think he saw us?

203
00:24:42,027 --> 00:24:44,276
Man #1: No, he doesn't
know what's going on.

204
00:24:44,342 --> 00:24:47,252
City slicker didn't see shit.

205
00:25:00,521 --> 00:25:02,815
Man #2: You know, that punk mighta got
the best of us in the bar yesterday,

206
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:05,998
but next time we won't be drunk
and then we'll see what happens.

207
00:25:06,064 --> 00:25:09,304
We'll be all over that boy.

208
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,069
Second man: Look at that smug
son of a bitch over there.

209
00:25:13,135 --> 00:25:14,407
Man #1: I know.

210
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:16,817
Man #2: He's gonna have a
little nap by the river.

211
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:18,602
Well, he may never wake up.

212
00:25:18,668 --> 00:25:20,141
(laughs quietly)

213
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:23,291
Man #1: Where's his brother?

214
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:25,231
Man #2: I don't know;
he'll be here soon enough.

215
00:25:25,297 --> 00:25:27,243
They'll get theirs.

216
00:25:28,104 --> 00:25:33,039
He come down from New York
City, the fancy city boy.

217
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,782
Man #1: I've had my eye on
their land up there for a while.

218
00:25:37,848 --> 00:25:38,678
Man #2: Yeah, no kidding, man.

219
00:25:38,744 --> 00:25:43,071
Think there's actually gold on theirs,
opposed to our weak-assed claims?

220
00:25:44,778 --> 00:25:48,752
Voiceover: Finding a spot
on the bank of the river,

221
00:25:48,818 --> 00:25:54,016
Joshua soon dozed off with thoughts of his
early childhood running through his head.

222
00:25:54,082 --> 00:26:01,480
(mellow music)

223
00:26:01,546 --> 00:26:04,961
Voiceover: He remembered his little
brother Jeff as they ran [unintelligible],

224
00:26:05,027 --> 00:26:09,716
helping feed the sled dogs with their dad.

225
00:26:09,782 --> 00:26:17,781
(dogs barking)

226
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:21,377
Voiceover: Following
in his dad's footsteps,

227
00:26:21,443 --> 00:26:28,068
becoming an accomplished dog
musher himself, just like his dad.

228
00:26:28,134 --> 00:26:36,133
(mellow music)

229
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:50,335
(dogs barking)

230
00:26:50,593 --> 00:26:58,593
(mellow music)

231
00:27:02,381 --> 00:27:05,943
Voiceover: He also carried on the
traditional ways of log building,

232
00:27:09,264 --> 00:27:13,069
as well as becoming a great fisherman.

233
00:27:13,135 --> 00:27:16,903
They were obviously brothers from
the same blood; that was a given.

234
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:24,968
(mellow music)

235
00:28:01,671 --> 00:28:09,670
(bird sounds)

236
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:18,067
(mellow music)

237
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:48,560
(splashing water)

238
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:04,278
(mellow music)

239
00:29:05,883 --> 00:29:09,096
Jeff: Joshua; Joshua, it's me!

240
00:29:09,162 --> 00:29:12,530
Hey, it's me, your
brother; Joshua, get up!

241
00:29:12,596 --> 00:29:13,577
(happy laughter)

242
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:15,280
Jeff: Man, it's been a long time!

243
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:19,000
Joshua: It's been too long;
look at you - fit and trim, huh?

244
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:20,393
Jeff: You look great; you look great, too.

245
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:21,519
Joshua: Thank you; thank you.

246
00:29:21,585 --> 00:29:22,563
Jeff: Let's get after this, huh?

247
00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:30,629
Joshua: Let's do it, man.
Jeff: Nice to see ya.

248
00:29:32,755 --> 00:29:36,188
Man #1: Those are Jay Jay
Johnson's kids, right; Jeffrey?

249
00:29:36,254 --> 00:29:37,607
Man #2: Uh huh, uh huh.

250
00:29:37,673 --> 00:29:38,909
Man #1: That's his brother
over there [unintelligible].

251
00:29:38,975 --> 00:29:42,470
When they read his will,
they're gonna be on that land.

252
00:29:42,536 --> 00:29:44,516
I always had my eye on that, ya know.

253
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,764
Man #2: Yeah, I don't need no
company up in our neck of the woods.

254
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:50,538
Man #1: Damn right; it'll be
awful crowded up there real soon.

255
00:29:50,604 --> 00:29:52,198
Man #2: Yeah, tell me about it.

256
00:29:52,264 --> 00:29:57,743
Man #1: Think we may, uh, have
to take care of this problem.

257
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:00,284
Man #2: I think we can
think of a thing or two

258
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:03,383
to solve our little issue
here with the Johnson boys.

259
00:30:03,449 --> 00:30:05,153
Man #1: That's right.

260
00:30:05,219 --> 00:30:07,954
When they read that will, they're
gonna have to get some ideas.

261
00:30:10,137 --> 00:30:13,444
Man #2: Well, I've got an idea or two.

262
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,016
Man #1: I've got one or two myself.

263
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:17,828
Man #2: Uh huh.

264
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:26,523
Joshua: Say, did you ever
see those guys before?

265
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:30,853
Jeff: No; I don't care for that type much.

266
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:34,060
Joshua: Yeah, let's go.

267
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,652
Jeff: I can't believe
your first night here,

268
00:30:39,718 --> 00:30:42,862
you already got yourself in a
mess of trouble with them guys.

269
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:44,424
Tell me about it.

270
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,524
Joshua: Well, you know, it just
seems to follow me, you know.

271
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,605
You know those two guys
I pointed out to you?

272
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:49,617
Jeff: Yeah.

273
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:50,598
Joshua: That was them.

274
00:30:50,664 --> 00:30:52,048
Jeff: Oh, that riff-raff there.

275
00:30:52,114 --> 00:30:58,861
Joshua: Yeah, I was at the Fairview and they
just tripped this kid that was walking around.

276
00:30:58,927 --> 00:31:00,143
I couldn't just let that go.

277
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:02,089
Jeff: See, that's the problem
I have with this community,

278
00:31:02,155 --> 00:31:05,082
the riff-raff that seem to
be collecting a little more.

279
00:31:05,148 --> 00:31:09,688
It's good to have some good,
honest new guys comin' into town

280
00:31:09,754 --> 00:31:11,987
to show some honest goodness around here.

281
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:14,150
Joshua: Right; you have
my back, though, right?

282
00:31:14,216 --> 00:31:16,026
Jeff: I got you; I got you, bud.

283
00:31:16,092 --> 00:31:16,756
(both laugh quietly)

284
00:31:16,822 --> 00:31:18,685
Jeff: Just like old times.

285
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,997
Joshua: Yep, you know it.

286
00:31:20,063 --> 00:31:28,062
(mellow music)

287
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:41,330
(birds singing)

288
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:49,967
(mellow music)

289
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,036
Joshua: Well, look who's here.

290
00:32:11,102 --> 00:32:12,342
Hey, pal.

291
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:13,909
Jeff: How ya doin'?

292
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:14,974
Joshua: I made it.

293
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,591
Jeff: You did; nice to see ya, just
in time for dinner, too, I see.

294
00:32:18,657 --> 00:32:21,085
Joshua: Ah, thank God; I'm starving.

295
00:32:21,151 --> 00:32:25,703
Jeff: Well, as you see, we
got some bear meat here.

296
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:27,155
Joshua: Bear meat?

297
00:32:27,221 --> 00:32:29,036
Jeff: I know you don't
like seein' 'em, but -

298
00:32:29,102 --> 00:32:31,224
Joshua: Did you shoot this bear yourself?

299
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,633
Jeff: I did; I had to;
I didn't really want to.

300
00:32:33,699 --> 00:32:35,672
It was more of a need than a want.

301
00:32:35,738 --> 00:32:38,572
Yeah, there was not a way that I
was gonna let this bear get into it.

302
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:42,025
He's been giving me a problem the last
coupla years, so his time was due.

303
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:49,131
Joshua: Well, you know, Dad
was a heck of a guy, huh?

304
00:32:49,197 --> 00:32:52,487
Jeff: Yeah, yep; you guys are a lot alike.

305
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,480
Joshua: Really?

306
00:32:53,546 --> 00:32:54,505
Jeff: A lot alike.

307
00:32:54,571 --> 00:32:56,943
Quite a few years ago,
we had a bear that broke

308
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:59,143
in the camp here and started
gettin' into our cache.

309
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:02,049
Same thing; we cooked up the bear
[unintelligible], sitting over a fire,

310
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:09,032
and I tell you what, just you being here
with me right now is just so much similar

311
00:33:09,098 --> 00:33:12,399
to Dad bein' here that, even though
you didn't get along with him

312
00:33:12,475 --> 00:33:14,998
and you guys didn't see
eye-to-eye all the time,

313
00:33:15,064 --> 00:33:17,786
the genetics really pulled through.

314
00:33:17,852 --> 00:33:21,236
You guys are so parallel
together, it's just incredible.

315
00:33:21,302 --> 00:33:24,515
You know, the genetics
really did pull through.

316
00:33:24,581 --> 00:33:29,479
Joshua: Well, maybe that's why me and him
never really saw eye-to-eye, you know?

317
00:33:29,545 --> 00:33:32,624
Jeff: Maybe; maybe, you
guys are too similar.

318
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,577
Joshua: Yeah, the old hard head.

319
00:33:34,643 --> 00:33:36,365
(both men laughing)

320
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,867
Jeff: Well, we loved the guy.

321
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,024
Joshua: Yeah.

322
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,730
Jeff: God rest his soul.

323
00:33:42,796 --> 00:33:50,795
(mellow music)

324
00:33:51,493 --> 00:33:56,023
Jeff: All right, I'm gonna get some
more wood here. Joshua: All right.

325
00:33:56,089 --> 00:34:04,088
(mellow music)

326
00:34:08,275 --> 00:34:11,058
Jeff: Ah, lovely.

327
00:34:11,124 --> 00:34:13,143
Joshua: How's that bear coming?

328
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:18,197
Jeff: The bear; it could use a little
bit longer, a little bit longer.

329
00:34:18,263 --> 00:34:22,087
Joshua: I still can't
believe that people eat bear.

330
00:34:22,153 --> 00:34:24,011
Jeff: Aw, man, you been
in the city too long.

331
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,546
Joshua: Yeah.

332
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:28,404
Jeff: Welcome home.

333
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:33,354
Joshua: You know, it has been years
since I've sat around an outdoor fire.

334
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,210
Jeff: Really?

335
00:34:34,276 --> 00:34:36,849
Joshua: Yeah, you know, in the city -

336
00:34:36,915 --> 00:34:38,575
Jeff: What do ya do?

337
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:41,010
Joshua: Yeah, everyone's just in a
hole in the wall in some building.

338
00:34:41,076 --> 00:34:42,441
Everyone has the same heat.

339
00:34:42,507 --> 00:34:45,551
Heat is a button on the wall you push.

340
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:50,675
It's convenient but
it's soulless, you know?

341
00:34:50,741 --> 00:34:52,125
There's no freedom to it.

342
00:34:53,862 --> 00:34:55,430
So, are the salmon running yet?

343
00:34:55,496 --> 00:34:59,512
Jeff: Not for a couple of
weeks, but when they come in,

344
00:34:59,578 --> 00:35:02,466
they're gonna come in pretty heavy and I could
really use your help if you're gonna be around.

345
00:35:02,532 --> 00:35:04,308
Joshua: They're gonna come in force, huh?

346
00:35:04,374 --> 00:35:06,004
Jeff: Force; just like these mosquitoes.

347
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,197
Joshua: Oh, yeah.

348
00:35:07,263 --> 00:35:08,722
Jeff: I bet you didn't miss these big -

349
00:35:08,788 --> 00:35:10,409
Joshua: Not at all.

350
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:13,316
Jeff: How's that; that enough for ya?

351
00:35:13,382 --> 00:35:15,022
Joshua: I think that'll do for right now.

352
00:35:17,103 --> 00:35:23,198
You know, don't take this the
wrong way, but I'm kinda glad

353
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:27,515
that he's not around to hear me
admit that he was right about Sheila.

354
00:35:27,581 --> 00:35:29,439
Jeff: Sheila.

355
00:35:30,992 --> 00:35:34,800
Joshua: That was the last
argument me and him had.

356
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,006
Jeff: Yeah.

357
00:35:36,072 --> 00:35:39,670
Joshua: The whole reason I moved to New
York; the biggest mistake of my life.

358
00:35:39,736 --> 00:35:42,585
Jeff: Whatever happened to Sheila?

359
00:35:42,651 --> 00:35:48,028
Joshua: She ran off with
some guy named Moe, Moe Lunt.

360
00:35:48,094 --> 00:35:56,093
Yeah, what I wouldn't give to go back
and fix things with Dad, you know?

361
00:35:57,041 --> 00:36:02,258
Jeff: Yeah. Joshua: That last argument we had just.
- I'll never get to tell him "sorry."

362
00:36:02,324 --> 00:36:03,835
Jeff: Yeah.

363
00:36:03,901 --> 00:36:07,921
Joshua: Some of my greatest
memories of me and him were fishing.

364
00:36:07,987 --> 00:36:09,912
Jeff: Oh, absolutely.

365
00:36:09,978 --> 00:36:14,196
Joshua: I haven't had a lot of time
to do that, a lot of opportunity,

366
00:36:14,262 --> 00:36:17,583
You know, living in New York City,
you don't get to do that a whole lot.

367
00:36:17,649 --> 00:36:19,090
Jeff: You don't get a chance.

368
00:36:19,156 --> 00:36:23,426
You don't get a chance to swat mosquitoes,
walk in a river, catch a salmon.

369
00:36:23,492 --> 00:36:25,339
Joshua: I've missed it.

370
00:36:25,405 --> 00:36:28,756
Jeff: So, tell me about those two
others guys at the bar the other night.

371
00:36:28,822 --> 00:36:35,538
Joshua: Oh well, you know, I run into
people like that all the time in New York.

372
00:36:35,604 --> 00:36:38,923
You know, people there don't
believe in manners anymore.

373
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,579
I was getting sick of it.

374
00:36:41,645 --> 00:36:44,602
I was actually kind of glad to come
to Alaska to kinda get away from them,

375
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:46,963
then that's like the
first thing I run into.

376
00:36:47,029 --> 00:36:49,758
Jeff: Yeah, come to think about
it, I do remember seeing those guys

377
00:36:49,824 --> 00:36:52,587
up the tracks quite a while ago,

378
00:36:52,653 --> 00:36:57,004
but the worst part about that is that's where our
claim is, and that's where we're gonna be goin'.

379
00:36:58,162 --> 00:37:01,178
There might be a chance that we're
gonna run into those guys again.

380
00:37:01,244 --> 00:37:05,267
Joshua: Ah, that'd be
very unfortunate for them.

381
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:08,398
Jeff: While you're here, I know you've taken care
of business with them, but now I would assume

382
00:37:08,464 --> 00:37:13,078
that they're gonna be gettin' really mad and
greedy, and if they're going up that way,

383
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:19,844
they're goin' up that way for one reason
and one reason only, and that's no good.

384
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:23,027
That's where Dad's claim is, and
that's where we're gonna be goin'.

385
00:37:23,093 --> 00:37:26,654
Joshua: Well, I wouldn't
worry about them too much.

386
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,272
Jeff: I'm glad that you came around, brother,
to knock those guys around a little bit,

387
00:37:30,338 --> 00:37:32,017
and show 'em who's boss in town here.

388
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,218
Joshua: How do they get up there?

389
00:37:34,284 --> 00:37:39,165
Jeff: There's actually a flagstop train that heads
up north about 60 miles, where people can wave

390
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:44,121
and they can get dropped off or they can
get picked up along the railroad tracks.

391
00:37:44,187 --> 00:37:46,457
Joshua: Is that the way we're going?

392
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:47,617
Jeff: Yep.

393
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:49,714
Joshua: Well, I'm really
glad I made it here.

394
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,522
Jeff: Just in time; perfect, perfect.

395
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,721
I'm gonna get goin'.

396
00:37:55,787 --> 00:37:58,398
I've gotta get home and take
care of my chores - dog chores.

397
00:37:58,464 --> 00:38:04,054
Upstairs in the cache, Dad's
got a bed upstairs there.

398
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,068
Joshua: A bed, really?

399
00:38:05,134 --> 00:38:06,051
Jeff: That's your spot.

400
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,057
Joshua: He put a bed in the cache?

401
00:38:07,123 --> 00:38:08,292
Jeff: That's his little hideout.

402
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:10,798
Joshua: He thought of
everything, didn't he?

403
00:38:10,864 --> 00:38:16,027
Jeff: Oh, yeah; anyway, buddy, I'll
catch up with ya in the morning.

404
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,346
Joshua: Sleep well.

405
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:18,935
Jeff: Right, you have a good night.

406
00:38:19,001 --> 00:38:20,907
Joshua: Yeah, I'll try.

407
00:38:20,973 --> 00:38:28,972
(majestic music)

408
00:38:36,265 --> 00:38:37,963
Joshua: Bear, huh?

409
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:46,028
(majestic music)

410
00:38:52,321 --> 00:38:55,842
Joshua: Not as bad as I thought it'd be.

411
00:39:08,238 --> 00:39:13,427
I'm gonna sleep like the dead tonight.

412
00:39:21,182 --> 00:39:29,181
(suspenseful music)

413
00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:59,235
Man #1: Aw, shit!

414
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:07,300
(sounds of men fighting)

415
00:40:09,806 --> 00:40:13,720
Man #2: That'll teach them Johnson boys.

416
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:28,498
Man: I knew your dad, and I
grew up with your dad as a kid.

417
00:40:28,564 --> 00:40:30,864
Your dad and I climbed McKinley together.

418
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,929
We hunted together; we fished together.

419
00:40:33,995 --> 00:40:36,301
We took many adventures together.

420
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,813
Joshua: There's so much about
him that I don't really know.

421
00:40:38,879 --> 00:40:40,531
I never really knew him.

422
00:40:40,597 --> 00:40:43,647
Man: He was a hell of a
man; he was a heck of a guy.

423
00:40:43,713 --> 00:40:45,771
We're gonna miss him.

424
00:40:45,837 --> 00:40:48,877
Diana, do you have
Johnson's file, by chance?

425
00:40:51,046 --> 00:40:53,725
Diana: Yes, I do; here it is, sir.

426
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:56,450
Man: All right, thank you.

427
00:40:56,516 --> 00:40:59,002
You know, your dad was
quite the adventurer.

428
00:40:59,068 --> 00:41:01,560
We climbed McKinley
together back in the day.

429
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,975
We've been on a lot of
different rafting trips.

430
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:10,038
You know, your dad owns a lot of gold claims
in the state of Alaska - I mean a ton.

431
00:41:10,842 --> 00:41:12,877
Joshua: I had heard that, yeah.

432
00:41:12,943 --> 00:41:15,164
I haven't been there
but my brother Jeff has.

433
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:21,435
Man: Sure, you know, looking at
the provisions of your dad's will,

434
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:24,160
I'd say you're in for quite a ride.

435
00:41:24,226 --> 00:41:29,087
What your dad has done with all
of these gold claims he has,

436
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:33,081
he's basically set up a
maze for you to go through,

437
00:41:33,147 --> 00:41:38,704
location to location, with clues to
find your way along this journey.

438
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:45,009
Whoever gets through this maze, essentially,
will find the gold at the end of the rainbow.

439
00:41:45,075 --> 00:41:49,156
It also goes on to say, "If
this treasure is not found,

440
00:41:49,222 --> 00:41:52,581
"claimed and recorded with
a one-month time period,

441
00:41:52,647 --> 00:41:59,583
"it then becomes open, fair game, to any
such person who dare takes on the challenge."

442
00:41:59,649 --> 00:42:01,906
Joshua: Laughs.

443
00:42:02,321 --> 00:42:04,406
That sounds like something Dad would do.

444
00:42:04,472 --> 00:42:08,212
It also sounds like a lot of fun.

445
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:11,122
Man: Maps to the gold mines.

446
00:42:16,843 --> 00:42:19,873
Joshua: I don't even know
how to read this gibberish.

447
00:42:19,939 --> 00:42:21,995
Man: This was your dad's doing.

448
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:24,401
Your dad set this up this way.

449
00:42:24,467 --> 00:42:27,826
He wants you and your brothers to work
on the clues and to find the treasure.

450
00:42:27,892 --> 00:42:29,994
It's up to you guys.

451
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:34,657
Joshua: Laughs; maybe Jeff can read it.

452
00:42:34,723 --> 00:42:37,986
Man: I got something
else here for ya, Joshua.

453
00:42:42,078 --> 00:42:46,401
Your dad, back in the day,
took down this rogue grizzly

454
00:42:46,467 --> 00:42:50,028
with a single shot from
a Smith and Wesson .44.

455
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:58,266
Joshua: Laughs; I can't believe it.

456
00:42:58,332 --> 00:43:06,331
I hate bears, and he knew that;
and he leaves me this - hmm.

457
00:43:09,797 --> 00:43:12,427
Man: Your dad was a hell of a man.

458
00:43:12,493 --> 00:43:19,433
(phone rings)

459
00:43:19,499 --> 00:43:22,543
Man: Hmm, it's the hospital.

460
00:43:22,609 --> 00:43:28,278
Hello; yes, yes he is.

461
00:43:28,344 --> 00:43:31,551
Yes, hold on one moment.

462
00:43:34,674 --> 00:43:36,778
Joshua: Is he all right?

463
00:43:36,844 --> 00:43:38,334
I'll be right there.

464
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,176
My brother isn't here because he got the crap
beat out of him last night; he's in the hospital.

465
00:43:43,242 --> 00:43:44,291
Man: Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

466
00:43:44,357 --> 00:43:45,515
Joshua: No, I've gotta go.

467
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:49,053
Man: Well, listen, before you leave, your
father has a good friend by the name of Alex.

468
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,366
He's a native Alaskan, and he
can help you on this journey.

469
00:43:53,432 --> 00:43:56,614
You can probably find Alex at
one of your dad's old cabins.

470
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,239
Probably the best one to check
first would be his old cabin

471
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:03,412
at the confluence of the Talkeetna,
the Chulitna, and the Susitna river.

472
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:05,282
Joshua: Thank you very much.

473
00:44:05,348 --> 00:44:07,015
Man: Good luck to you.

474
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:09,462
Joshua: Yes; I gotta go.

475
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:20,629
(mellow music)

476
00:44:26,005 --> 00:44:29,267
(man releases arrow from bow)

477
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:37,332
(mellow music)

478
00:45:08,942 --> 00:45:13,819
Joshua: Anybody home?

479
00:45:15,434 --> 00:45:18,364
Hey; hey!

480
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:20,296
Are you Alex?

481
00:45:20,362 --> 00:45:22,081
Alex: Yes.

482
00:45:22,147 --> 00:45:23,956
Joshua: Are you friends
with Jay Jay Johnson?

483
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:27,090
Alex: Yes, who are you?

484
00:45:27,156 --> 00:45:30,094
Joshua: I'm his son, Joshua.

485
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,959
I've been looking for you;
I heard you were here.

486
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:35,906
Alex: Well, you found me.

487
00:45:38,521 --> 00:45:41,803
Joshua, I miss your dad a lot.

488
00:45:43,048 --> 00:45:45,524
[That's where I live.]

489
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:52,637
Joshua: Nice duck.

490
00:45:52,703 --> 00:45:56,307
Alex: It's what I got
with my hunting bow today.

491
00:45:56,373 --> 00:45:58,050
Joshua: You got that today?

492
00:45:58,116 --> 00:46:02,057
Alex: Yes, from the river.

493
00:46:04,081 --> 00:46:08,871
Your dad believed life is to be lived.

494
00:46:11,622 --> 00:46:14,597
Joshua: Hmm, is that bread?

495
00:46:14,663 --> 00:46:17,362
Alex: Yeah, that's [unintelligible].

496
00:46:17,428 --> 00:46:18,352
Joshua: What is it?

497
00:46:18,418 --> 00:46:22,160
Alex: [Unintelligible],
bread, grouse and ducks.

498
00:46:22,226 --> 00:46:25,408
Joshua: You and my dad, you
guys made it out here, right?

499
00:46:25,474 --> 00:46:26,412
Alex: Yes.

500
00:46:26,478 --> 00:46:29,464
Joshua: Yeah, you knew him best;
you were his best friend, right?

501
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:36,171
Alex: Yes, him and I hunt
together, survived together.

502
00:46:36,237 --> 00:46:39,812
Then, at last, I heard he was dead.

503
00:46:39,878 --> 00:46:45,896
Joshua: At my father's will reading, he
gave me a map that led to all his claims.

504
00:46:46,373 --> 00:46:48,663
Alex: I know all those places.

505
00:46:48,729 --> 00:46:52,547
In two days, I can take
you there; be ready.

506
00:46:53,796 --> 00:46:56,366
Joshua: I'm glad because
I can't read them.

507
00:46:56,432 --> 00:46:58,138
They're like Greek to me.

508
00:46:59,937 --> 00:47:04,954
Alex: Your father write 'em.

509
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:07,314
Joshua: Keep your eyes open, Alex.

510
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,762
There may be some bad guys looking for ya.

511
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:14,169
If they get ahold of you, they're gonna
hurt you, like they did my brother Jeff.

512
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:19,024
As long as I'm with you,
you're okay, all right?

513
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:24,173
But when you're away from
me, be on your guard.

514
00:47:24,742 --> 00:47:28,424
This scum will stop at nothing.

515
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:33,894
They're gonna try and get to
my father's claims before I do.

516
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:41,959
I wouldn't be surprised if they're
following me now, so just be careful.

517
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,482
Alex: I will.

518
00:47:45,548 --> 00:47:53,547
(melancholic music)

519
00:48:20,515 --> 00:48:28,514
(bird sounds)

520
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:39,159
(melancholic music)

521
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:56,029
(bird sounds)

522
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:07,669
(melancholic music)

523
00:49:07,855 --> 00:49:11,020
Voiceover: The first part of the
journey for Joshua and Alex was

524
00:49:11,086 --> 00:49:15,285
to follow the Hatcher Pass
trail, which led them 33 miles

525
00:49:15,351 --> 00:49:22,063
from Tidewater up to the 4,000 foot Hatcher
Pass and the headwaters of the Talkeetna River.

526
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:30,128
(melancholic music and singing)

527
00:50:41,141 --> 00:50:44,321
Alex: That [unintelligible]
cabin [unintelligible].

528
00:50:44,387 --> 00:50:52,386
(majestic singing)

529
00:51:57,928 --> 00:51:59,543
Joshua: So where are we on the maps here?

530
00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:02,160
Alex: We're right there, [Unintelligible].

531
00:52:02,226 --> 00:52:03,222
Joshua: Right here?

532
00:52:03,288 --> 00:52:04,075
Alex: [Unintelligible], yeah.

533
00:52:04,141 --> 00:52:05,102
Joshua: Okay, and that's this way?

534
00:52:05,168 --> 00:52:09,493
Alex: Yes.
Joshua: All right, let's go.

535
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:15,534
(lively music)

536
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,078
Joshua: How about right here?

537
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:27,051
(splashing water)

538
00:52:28,162 --> 00:52:36,161
(lively music)

539
00:53:08,922 --> 00:53:16,921
(sound of digging)

540
00:53:18,957 --> 00:53:26,956
(rushing water)

541
00:53:39,603 --> 00:53:43,905
(majestic music)

542
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:51,970
(rushing water)

543
00:54:01,106 --> 00:54:07,982
(majestic music)

544
00:54:08,048 --> 00:54:10,263
Joshua: And that's where
we're going, that way?

545
00:54:10,329 --> 00:54:12,647
It's that way, you're sure?

546
00:54:12,713 --> 00:54:14,961
You're sure about this?

547
00:54:15,027 --> 00:54:16,306
Okay, let's go.

548
00:54:16,372 --> 00:54:24,371
(majestic music)

549
00:54:47,588 --> 00:54:49,986
Joshua: We have to cross this?

550
00:54:50,052 --> 00:54:51,481
Shit!

551
00:54:52,797 --> 00:54:59,934
(majestic music)

552
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,986
Uhhh!

553
00:55:03,052 --> 00:55:11,051
(majestic music)

554
00:55:19,213 --> 00:55:22,248
Voiceover: After 16 miles, they
had reached the ultimate test,

555
00:55:22,314 --> 00:55:27,058
a steep 1,000 foot climb up
to the summit of Hatcher Pass.

556
00:55:27,124 --> 00:55:35,124
(mellow music)

557
00:55:48,304 --> 00:55:56,303
Voiceover: Desperate to reach the gold fields,
they pressed their luck through rain, fog and snow.

558
00:55:56,569 --> 00:56:04,568
(lively music)

559
00:56:10,025 --> 00:56:14,542
Voiceover: Two weeks had passed and they
had little, if any, luck gold-panning,

560
00:56:14,608 --> 00:56:17,208
trying to find any kind of
color from the creek beds.

561
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:19,579
Most would have turned back along the way,

562
00:56:19,645 --> 00:56:25,327
but they continued on, bound
to find his father's treasure.

563
00:56:25,393 --> 00:56:33,392
(splashing water)

564
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:51,311
Joshua: Hey, I have something!

565
00:56:51,377 --> 00:56:53,951
Alex: Gold!

566
00:56:57,533 --> 00:57:01,200
(thunder)

567
00:57:01,266 --> 00:57:03,516
Joshua: It's gonna really
storm here, isn't it?

568
00:57:03,582 --> 00:57:07,314
Alex: Yes, those are rain clouds.

569
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:11,032
Joshua: How do you tell the difference
between rain and snow clouds?

570
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:14,103
Alex: Because they'e Grey.

571
00:57:14,169 --> 00:57:17,266
Joshua: I see.

572
00:57:17,332 --> 00:57:20,176
(majestic music)

573
00:57:20,242 --> 00:57:21,112
(birds singing)

574
00:57:21,178 --> 00:57:29,177
(majestic music)

575
00:58:00,321 --> 00:58:04,043
Joshua: What a piece of shit!

576
00:58:04,109 --> 00:58:09,756
Looks like the bears got into this.

577
00:58:09,822 --> 00:58:15,334
My dad lived in this thing?

578
00:58:20,809 --> 00:58:24,958
What kind of clue am I
supposed to find here?

579
00:58:25,024 --> 00:58:31,540
The clue must be that a bear got into all
of his shit, and we're not gonna get any.

580
00:58:31,606 --> 00:58:37,389
The place looks like it's been
destroyed for like a year or so.

581
00:58:37,455 --> 00:58:39,424
The valley is pretty.

582
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:41,356
Alex: It's pretty.

583
00:58:41,422 --> 00:58:44,421
It sure was a nice cabin
before the bears got into it.

584
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:46,339
Joshua: Why did you guys come here?

585
00:58:46,405 --> 00:58:48,728
What was this cabin's purpose?

586
00:58:48,794 --> 00:58:50,400
Alex: Wolves and wolverines.

587
00:58:50,466 --> 00:58:52,183
Joshua: You hunted wolves?

588
00:58:52,249 --> 00:58:55,324
Alex: Yes, trapping.

589
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:57,142
Joshua: Trapping.

590
00:58:57,208 --> 00:59:00,682
Alex: Yes.

591
00:59:00,748 --> 00:59:05,487
Joshua: I think I got what my
dad's trying to tell me here.

592
00:59:05,553 --> 00:59:13,552
(majestic music)

593
00:59:45,507 --> 00:59:53,506
(rushing water)

594
00:59:58,452 --> 01:00:06,451
(lively music)

595
01:01:36,573 --> 01:01:39,326
Joshua: He wanted to live
here, in this little house?

596
01:01:39,858 --> 01:01:42,768
Alex: Yes.

597
01:01:46,405 --> 01:01:48,897
Joshua: You been here many times?

598
01:01:49,091 --> 01:01:51,633
Alex: Yes, with your father.

599
01:01:51,699 --> 01:01:55,333
He built his cabin for gold mining.

600
01:01:55,399 --> 01:01:56,703
Joshua: For gold mining?

601
01:01:56,769 --> 01:01:59,562
Alex: Yes, there's gold back there.

602
01:01:59,628 --> 01:02:01,056
Joshua: You and him are gold-mining here?

603
01:02:01,122 --> 01:02:03,113
Alex: Yes.

604
01:02:03,179 --> 01:02:05,057
Joshua: His claim's up there?

605
01:02:05,123 --> 01:02:08,916
Well, that's it; no wonder
he wanted to live here.

606
01:02:08,982 --> 01:02:10,662
It's near his gold claims.

607
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:11,432
Alex: Yes.

608
01:02:11,498 --> 01:02:13,248
Joshua: The treasure he spoke of.

609
01:02:13,314 --> 01:02:16,080
Alex: It's in the Pass;
it's there for you.

610
01:02:16,146 --> 01:02:17,643
Joshua: Laughs.

611
01:02:17,709 --> 01:02:19,396
We're just about there.

612
01:02:19,462 --> 01:02:27,461
(majestic music)

613
01:03:36,865 --> 01:03:39,140
Alex: Do you know this
is the Independence Mine?

614
01:03:39,206 --> 01:03:41,409
Your dad used to live there.

615
01:03:41,475 --> 01:03:42,220
Joshua: There?

616
01:03:42,286 --> 01:03:45,667
Alex: Yes, the bunker house.

617
01:03:45,733 --> 01:03:47,584
Joshua: What, for the miners?

618
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:48,795
Alex: Yes.

619
01:03:48,861 --> 01:03:49,964
Joshua: Did my father work here?

620
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:53,631
Alex: Yes, he was an Independence worker.

621
01:03:53,697 --> 01:03:56,498
Joshua: Independence worker.

622
01:03:56,564 --> 01:03:57,840
Alex: Yes.

623
01:04:01,082 --> 01:04:03,887
Joshua: Huh.

624
01:04:03,953 --> 01:04:11,952
(majestic music)

625
01:07:18,086 --> 01:07:20,798
Joshua: Hey, Alex, where are ya, man?

626
01:07:20,864 --> 01:07:24,860
We're burning daylight!

627
01:07:24,926 --> 01:07:26,394
I told him to be careful.

628
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,944
You okay, man?

629
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:32,382
Are you all right?

630
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:38,860
They got him.

631
01:07:38,926 --> 01:07:45,579
(sound of boat)

632
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:53,644
(majestic music)

633
01:07:54,978 --> 01:07:57,305
Man in hat: Hey, hello there!

634
01:07:57,371 --> 01:07:59,495
Joshua: I'm looking for
a way to get upriver.

635
01:07:59,561 --> 01:08:02,554
Man in hat: Well, you'll need a
power boat, jet boat, something.

636
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,148
Joshua: Where can a person get one?

637
01:08:04,214 --> 01:08:05,735
Man in hat: This guy up
here will rent you one.

638
01:08:05,801 --> 01:08:07,259
Joshua: Sounds good.

639
01:08:11,242 --> 01:08:14,339
Man in hat: This is the
ticket for what you'll need.

640
01:08:14,405 --> 01:08:15,479
This guy can hook you up.

641
01:08:15,545 --> 01:08:17,290
Man: Howdy, Sim Smith.

642
01:08:17,356 --> 01:08:18,489
Joshua: Joshua Johnson.

643
01:08:18,555 --> 01:08:19,936
Sim: What can I do for ya?

644
01:08:20,002 --> 01:08:22,588
Joshua: I'm looking for a way to
get to my dad's cabin upriver.

645
01:08:22,654 --> 01:08:25,031
Sim: Well, I can take you up
there; how far ya gotta go?

646
01:08:25,097 --> 01:08:27,080
Joshua: About 20 miles.

647
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:32,004
Sim: Well, the rate for something like that would be
a hundred and fifty bucks for a drop-off and pick-up.

648
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:33,753
Joshua: I can do that.

649
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:35,667
Sim: Great; where ya need to go?

650
01:08:35,733 --> 01:08:38,300
Joshua: Oh, I'd recognize the landing.

651
01:08:38,366 --> 01:08:40,756
What do ya got up here?

652
01:08:40,822 --> 01:08:43,631
Sim: That's just Mad Dog's place.

653
01:08:43,697 --> 01:08:46,217
He's got a store; you can get
your provisions there if you need.

654
01:08:46,815 --> 01:08:49,077
Joshua: Yeah, I'm probably gonna
need to stock up on some stuff

655
01:08:49,143 --> 01:08:54,251
if I'm gonna go to my dad's cabin,
so why don't we just go on up there?

656
01:08:55,512 --> 01:08:59,921
I need some bacon, five pounds
of beef jerky, some coffee.

657
01:08:59,987 --> 01:09:02,569
When we get there, there won't
be any reason to go inside.

658
01:09:02,635 --> 01:09:05,030
We can just talk to him through the door.

659
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:16,905
So, you were at the
Fairview the other night?

660
01:09:17,464 --> 01:09:20,008
Sim: Yeah, you're that
guy from New York, right?

661
01:09:20,074 --> 01:09:24,157
I remember you're the guy that whipped
on those young rive rats there.

662
01:09:24,223 --> 01:09:25,467
Joshua: That was me.

663
01:09:25,533 --> 01:09:26,681
Sim: What are you up to now?

664
01:09:26,747 --> 01:09:30,093
Joshua: Oh, I got this
map in my dad's will.

665
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:35,599
It's supposed to lead to his gold, and I have
30 days from the time I get this to get it.

666
01:09:35,665 --> 01:09:37,877
Otherwise, it becomes public, you know.

667
01:09:37,943 --> 01:09:41,008
I've been here; I've been
there, and I've been there,

668
01:09:41,074 --> 01:09:44,642
but I haven't found this place yet.

669
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:48,072
Sim: Oh, okay, well I'm
familiar with these areas here.

670
01:09:48,138 --> 01:09:50,426
This one's a little tougher to get to.

671
01:09:50,492 --> 01:09:53,227
You've got a couple choices.

672
01:09:53,293 --> 01:09:57,960
You can take a riverboat, but I guess there
isn't a lot of those guys around right now,

673
01:09:58,026 --> 01:10:01,834
so I'd take the train, and you
jump on the train and run north.

674
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:06,410
You get off here, right in this
area here next to the tracks.

675
01:10:06,476 --> 01:10:08,720
He had a lot of stuff around the area.

676
01:10:08,786 --> 01:10:10,843
It's definitely worth takin' a look at.

677
01:10:10,909 --> 01:10:15,338
It might be good to find someone to
help get you to where you want to go.

678
01:10:15,404 --> 01:10:18,136
Joshua: I had Alex.

679
01:10:18,202 --> 01:10:20,300
Sim: What happened to Alex?

680
01:10:20,366 --> 01:10:25,578
Joshua: He was taken care of.

681
01:10:25,644 --> 01:10:27,551
Sim: Oh?

682
01:10:27,617 --> 01:10:31,760
Joshua: Yeah. Sim: Could it
have been them river rats, ya think?

683
01:10:31,867 --> 01:10:34,403
Joshua: Yeah, that's what I think.

684
01:10:34,469 --> 01:10:38,722
Sim: Well, it makes sense, 'cause they
been raising hell all over these parts

685
01:10:38,788 --> 01:10:42,177
for the last couple of years off and on.

686
01:10:42,243 --> 01:10:44,252
I wish somebody'd just take care of 'em.

687
01:10:44,318 --> 01:10:48,663
You know, that'd probably be the thing
to do but you know how that goes.

688
01:10:48,729 --> 01:10:51,448
Joshua: I'm startin' to come around
to that way of thinking myself.

689
01:10:51,514 --> 01:10:53,746
Sim: Yeah, I reckon.

690
01:10:53,812 --> 01:11:01,017
Sim: Here, why don't you take this with ya,
because you need to be prepared for 'em,

691
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:03,501
'cause I know they're looking for ya.

692
01:11:03,567 --> 01:11:09,131
Joshua: Yeah, well, I'm ready for them.

693
01:11:09,197 --> 01:11:15,693
(train sound)

694
01:11:15,759 --> 01:11:23,758
(mellow music)

695
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,423
(train whistle)

696
01:11:48,489 --> 01:11:56,488
(mellow music)

697
01:12:45,193 --> 01:12:46,806
Man on train: Well, good luck!

698
01:12:46,872 --> 01:12:47,800
Joshua: Thank you.

699
01:12:47,866 --> 01:12:49,495
Man on train: You're welcome.

700
01:12:49,561 --> 01:12:57,561
(mellow music)

701
01:13:35,992 --> 01:13:43,991
(mellow music)

702
01:15:04,798 --> 01:15:08,121
Joshua: I think I'm
starting to get it, Dad.

703
01:15:12,732 --> 01:15:20,732
(mellow music)

704
01:15:52,031 --> 01:16:00,028
(splashing water)

705
01:16:04,315 --> 01:16:06,261
Man #1: I think this is it.

706
01:16:06,327 --> 01:16:07,540
Man #2: Yeah?

707
01:16:07,606 --> 01:16:08,971
Man #1: Yeah, definitely.

708
01:16:09,037 --> 01:16:09,750
Man #2: Sweet!

709
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:14,608
Man #1: Johnson's cabin;
check this place out, dude!

710
01:16:14,674 --> 01:16:16,516
Man #2: Is it locked?

711
01:16:17,716 --> 01:16:19,738
Man #1: No!

712
01:16:19,804 --> 01:16:21,250
Man #2: Huh huh, dumbass!

713
01:16:22,019 --> 01:16:24,966
Man #1: All right, let's see what
we got; we probably don't have long.

714
01:16:25,296 --> 01:16:27,896
Man #2: No, if the door's
open, he's probably around.

715
01:16:28,911 --> 01:16:31,865
Man #1: All right, let's
see; oh, here's a bag; nice!

716
01:16:31,931 --> 01:16:35,456
Man #2: I think that's
like everything he owns.

717
01:16:35,522 --> 01:16:36,343
Man #1: Pretty sure, yeah.

718
01:16:36,409 --> 01:16:37,272
Man #2: Nice!

719
01:16:37,338 --> 01:16:38,623
Man #1: He's got it with him all the time.

720
01:16:38,689 --> 01:16:40,863
Man #2: That'll show him.

721
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:44,871
I'll tell you what, I'll look out back
and see if he's got anything out there.

722
01:16:44,937 --> 01:16:47,057
Man #1: All right, cool,
cool; I'll check it out here.

723
01:16:49,758 --> 01:16:57,757
(splashing water)

724
01:17:01,193 --> 01:17:05,918
(suspenseful music)

725
01:17:05,984 --> 01:17:08,443
Man #2: Nothing back there;
did you find anything else?

726
01:17:08,509 --> 01:17:10,438
Man #1: Not really, just odds and ends.

727
01:17:10,504 --> 01:17:13,167
Man #2: Okay, well, we probably
got another minute or so.

728
01:17:13,233 --> 01:17:18,419
Man #1: Oh, what's that?

729
01:17:20,142 --> 01:17:22,555
Man #2: Paydirt!

730
01:17:24,662 --> 01:17:29,436
Man #1: Hey, sweet, here!

731
01:17:29,502 --> 01:17:31,339
Man #2: I'll go stow this with the rest.

732
01:17:31,405 --> 01:17:33,704
Man #1: All right, good; got his bag.

733
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:41,769
(suspenseful music)

734
01:18:42,197 --> 01:18:49,117
Man #1: Oh, hey listen, calm
down; calm down a second, hey!

735
01:18:51,778 --> 01:18:57,138
Listen, calm down.

736
01:18:57,204 --> 01:18:59,094
Just take a minute.

737
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:03,938
Joshua: You know, you and your
rat-bastard friend have done nothing

738
01:19:04,004 --> 01:19:06,240
but cause me trouble since I got here.

739
01:19:06,306 --> 01:19:08,343
You sent my brother to the hospital.

740
01:19:08,409 --> 01:19:11,176
I find you in my father's
cabin stealing my stuff.

741
01:19:11,242 --> 01:19:16,640
Man #1: I don't know whose place this is!

742
01:19:16,706 --> 01:19:19,793
Man #2: Come on, let's go!

743
01:19:19,859 --> 01:19:27,858
(suspenseful music)

744
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:47,049
Joshua: Uh, aww!

745
01:20:10,762 --> 01:20:14,186
Dad, now I know why you gave this to me.

746
01:20:14,252 --> 01:20:22,251
(suspenseful music)

747
01:20:25,184 --> 01:20:28,311
Man #2: It's a good thing we found
this raft to get back to town.

748
01:20:28,377 --> 01:20:30,477
We'd have been walking for days.

749
01:20:30,543 --> 01:20:33,516
Man #1: Yeah, poor bastard,
just leavin' it out for anybody.

750
01:20:33,582 --> 01:20:36,938
Man #2: Yeah, time to go
cash in some of this gold.

751
01:20:41,552 --> 01:20:44,114
Man #1: Maybe we can finally
get some cash for this.

752
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:46,154
Man #2: Yeah.

753
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:52,444
(suspenseful music)

754
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:54,559
Man #1: That was a damn waste of time.

755
01:20:54,625 --> 01:20:57,517
Man #2: Don't I know it.

756
01:21:14,225 --> 01:21:21,758
(sound of motorboat)

757
01:21:21,824 --> 01:21:29,824
(suspenseful music)

758
01:21:40,484 --> 01:21:45,206
Man #2: Sure am glad Ted filled us in on
that clause in old man Johsnon's will.

759
01:21:45,272 --> 01:21:47,485
Man #1: Yeah, we caught a break there.

760
01:21:47,551 --> 01:21:49,175
Thirty days it expires, right?

761
01:21:49,241 --> 01:21:56,527
Man #2: Mm hmm, if any of them Johnson boys are still
alive in 30 days, they're gonna wish they weren't.

762
01:21:56,593 --> 01:21:58,802
Man #1: We oughta hurry up in any case.

763
01:21:58,868 --> 01:22:01,006
I don't much like the idea
of sharing that claim.

764
01:22:02,036 --> 01:22:06,960
Man #2: Well, if anybody else shows up,
we'll just take care of them the same way.

765
01:22:07,026 --> 01:22:11,142
Hey, hey, isn't that one of
the Johnson boys right there?

766
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,198
Man #1: Let's go.

767
01:22:14,264 --> 01:22:17,874
(suspenseful music)

768
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:20,897
Joshua: Bastards!

769
01:22:20,963 --> 01:22:28,962
(suspenseful music)

770
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:14,231
(splashing water)

771
01:23:18,573 --> 01:23:26,573
(dramatic music)

772
01:23:53,731 --> 01:23:56,761
Man #2: There's no way he
followed us up this far.

773
01:23:58,301 --> 01:24:00,224
Man #1: Hey, they left some canoes.

774
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:01,971
Man #2: Yeah, they did.

775
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:03,717
Man #1: He's goin' by land;
why don't we just cut across?

776
01:24:03,783 --> 01:24:05,219
Man #2: Okay.
Man #1: Beat him over.

777
01:24:05,285 --> 01:24:08,477
Man #2: Well, let's find the paddles;
gotta be around here somewhere, right?

778
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:10,330
Man #1: Yeah.

779
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:15,184
Man #2: Son of a bitch.

780
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,456
Man #1: Locked?

781
01:24:16,522 --> 01:24:17,506
Man #2: Yeah.

782
01:24:18,661 --> 01:24:21,600
Man #1: Smarter than the
guy with the raft, at least.

783
01:24:21,666 --> 01:24:26,467
Well, we can't always be lucky.

784
01:24:29,619 --> 01:24:37,619
Man #2: Well, let's see, it's probably best if
we just head off that way and loop back around.

785
01:24:37,707 --> 01:24:40,221
He'll probably follow the trail that way,
and we'll just bushwhack through here.

786
01:24:40,287 --> 01:24:41,827
We'll still stay ahead of him.

787
01:24:41,893 --> 01:24:43,737
Man #1: All right.

788
01:24:43,803 --> 01:24:51,802
(dramatic music)

789
01:25:33,903 --> 01:25:36,445
Man #2: That Jeff never
even saw us comin', did he?

790
01:25:36,511 --> 01:25:38,483
Man #1: No, he did not.

791
01:25:39,575 --> 01:25:43,286
That Alex kid, he was even
easier to take care of.

792
01:25:43,352 --> 01:25:47,414
Man #2: Laughs; tell me about it.

793
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:52,051
This guy, though, there's something.
- Something different about him.

794
01:25:52,117 --> 01:25:53,940
Man #1: The New Yorker?

795
01:25:54,006 --> 01:25:55,944
Man #2: Yeah.

796
01:25:56,010 --> 01:25:57,167
Man #1: Yeah.

797
01:25:57,233 --> 01:26:03,048
Man #2: He's got this tendency to make my life
a little more complicated than I tend to prefer.

798
01:26:03,114 --> 01:26:05,982
Man #1: Yeah, well,
we'll take care of him.

799
01:26:07,627 --> 01:26:10,454
He's a little different, though.

800
01:26:11,161 --> 01:26:13,761
Man #2: There's no way he
followed us up this far.

801
01:26:15,555 --> 01:26:19,987
Man:#1 I tell ya, you
with that two-by-four -

802
01:26:20,053 --> 01:26:23,393
Man #2: Yeah, he's not so tough
with lumber upside his head.

803
01:26:23,459 --> 01:26:26,286
Man #1: We caught him
off guard at the cabin.

804
01:26:26,352 --> 01:26:28,790
Man #2: Yeah, tell you what,
if he's still following us,

805
01:26:28,856 --> 01:26:32,236
he's probably out there in the
woods holding his map upside down.

806
01:26:32,302 --> 01:26:34,606
Man #1: Shit, we got his
bag; he ain't got crap!

807
01:26:34,892 --> 01:26:39,192
Man #2: Oh, yeah, we got his map now!

808
01:26:39,258 --> 01:26:43,038
Man #1: Yeah, I almost feel bad
for that poor son of a bitch.

809
01:26:43,104 --> 01:26:47,206
Man #2: Not me; he got
what was comin' to him.

810
01:26:47,272 --> 01:26:49,956
If he comes back, he's
gonna get some more.

811
01:26:50,022 --> 01:26:51,273
Man #1: Damn right.

812
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:54,076
Man #2: If the bears don't find him first.

813
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:02,790
What do ya say we head down to the
river and set up camp for the night?

814
01:27:02,856 --> 01:27:07,344
There ain't no way he's gonna
follow us all the way down there.

815
01:27:07,410 --> 01:27:12,909
Man #1: No, it seems safe enough;
I'm gettin' tired of breakin' bush.

816
01:27:12,975 --> 01:27:19,159
Man #2: No kiddin' - much
better at breakin' necks.

817
01:27:19,225 --> 01:27:24,773
(rushing water)

818
01:27:24,839 --> 01:27:32,838
(dramatic music)

819
01:29:06,714 --> 01:29:14,713
(fire crackling)

820
01:29:20,535 --> 01:29:28,534
(dramatic music)

821
01:29:29,244 --> 01:29:37,243
(rushing water)

822
01:29:54,246 --> 01:29:58,925
(dramatic music)

823
01:29:58,991 --> 01:30:06,990
(crackling fire)

824
01:30:19,255 --> 01:30:27,254
(dramatic music)

825
01:30:46,798 --> 01:30:49,428
Man #1: All right, let's
get the hell outta here.

826
01:30:49,494 --> 01:30:53,160
Man #2: Sure hope Ted gets here
soon; that weather's comin' in.

827
01:30:53,226 --> 01:30:54,687
Man #1: Yeah.

828
01:31:00,603 --> 01:31:04,902
Man #2: All right, here, you go grab the rest
of it; I need to get somethin' out of this one.

829
01:31:04,968 --> 01:31:09,455
Man #1: All right, back in a second.

830
01:31:09,521 --> 01:31:17,520
(dramatic music)

831
01:31:26,611 --> 01:31:27,803
Man #2: Shit!

832
01:31:27,869 --> 01:31:29,470
Joshua: You ain't goin' anywhere.

833
01:31:29,536 --> 01:31:30,687
Man #2: That's what you think!

834
01:31:30,753 --> 01:31:31,871
Joshua: Bullshit!

835
01:31:31,937 --> 01:31:38,227
Man #2: Oh!

836
01:31:38,293 --> 01:31:43,841
(sound of gunshot)

837
01:31:43,907 --> 01:31:45,383
Joshua: Hey, brother!

838
01:31:45,449 --> 01:31:46,743
Jeff: Watch out!

839
01:31:46,809 --> 01:31:49,434
(sound of gunshot)

840
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:57,499
(dramatic music)

841
01:31:59,801 --> 01:32:00,499
Joshua: Brother!

842
01:32:00,565 --> 01:32:03,075
Jeff: Hey, brother!

843
01:32:03,141 --> 01:32:04,949
Joshua: You had my back.

844
01:32:05,015 --> 01:32:06,965
Jeff: Always. Joshua: Wow, how
long have you been following me?

845
01:32:07,031 --> 01:32:09,371
Jeff: I've been following
you ever since over the Pass.

846
01:32:09,437 --> 01:32:10,090
Joshua: Really?

847
01:32:10,156 --> 01:32:13,341
Jeff: Yeah, Granite Pass, up that
way; I saw you up from the top.

848
01:32:13,407 --> 01:32:16,754
I didn't mess around, though;
I just knew you needed help.

849
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:18,982
Joshua: No; guess you
did, and you were right.

850
01:32:19,048 --> 01:32:22,176
(dramatic music)

851
01:32:29,475 --> 01:32:37,474
(dramatic music)

852
01:33:25,546 --> 01:33:28,550
Joshua: Hey, pal, come have a seat.

853
01:33:36,979 --> 01:33:38,602
Jeff: How ya doin'?

854
01:33:38,668 --> 01:33:42,773
Joshua: This was Alex's favorite spot.

855
01:33:42,839 --> 01:33:48,686
He would sit here for hours
just lookin' at the lake.

856
01:33:48,752 --> 01:33:51,428
This bench was built for him, in fact.

857
01:33:51,494 --> 01:33:53,021
Jeff: Really?

858
01:33:53,087 --> 01:33:55,703
Joshua: Mm hmm, he wanted
his ashes scattered here,

859
01:33:55,769 --> 01:33:59,662
so I wanted to come
back here one more time,

860
01:33:59,728 --> 01:34:01,936
just to say good-bye before I had to go.

861
01:34:02,002 --> 01:34:03,635
Jeff: Yeah.

862
01:34:06,264 --> 01:34:09,672
Joshua: Believe me, I
really don't want to.

863
01:34:09,738 --> 01:34:11,967
Jeff: Yeah, it's gonna
be sad to see you go.

864
01:34:12,033 --> 01:34:16,138
Yeah, it's been exciting.

865
01:34:16,204 --> 01:34:20,205
Joshua: Well, you know, there was
something that our father was trying

866
01:34:20,271 --> 01:34:22,619
to teach me throughout this whole ordeal.

867
01:34:22,685 --> 01:34:26,723
That treasure he spoke
of, it wasn't money.

868
01:34:26,789 --> 01:34:28,314
Jeff: It wasn't money.

869
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:31,463
Joshua: It wasn't gold;
it was being alive.

870
01:34:32,569 --> 01:34:37,073
That's what he understood,
and when I think

871
01:34:37,139 --> 01:34:40,178
about how I used to exist
in New York, you know,

872
01:34:40,244 --> 01:34:42,745
that wasn't living; that was subsisting.

873
01:34:42,811 --> 01:34:45,705
And this - well, there's no comparison.

874
01:34:45,771 --> 01:34:48,062
There's a richness here, a value.

875
01:34:48,128 --> 01:34:50,233
Jeff: Yeah, bein' alive.

876
01:34:50,299 --> 01:34:52,395
Joshua: It's the very
breath in your lungs,

877
01:34:52,461 --> 01:34:55,767
and that's something that he understood,

878
01:34:55,833 --> 01:34:57,795
and that's something that
our brothers need to know.

879
01:34:57,861 --> 01:35:00,890
That's why I have to go back.

880
01:35:00,956 --> 01:35:02,284
I have to go get them.

881
01:35:02,350 --> 01:35:05,788
Jeff: Yeah, it's too bad that you
couldn't stick around a little bit longer.

882
01:35:05,854 --> 01:35:10,260
Joshua: Yeah, believe me, the last thing
in the world I want to do now is leave,

883
01:35:10,326 --> 01:35:14,315
but I have to go back
and clear some things up.

884
01:35:14,381 --> 01:35:18,134
John and Joseph, they
need to come up here.

885
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:22,515
Jeff: Yeah, it'd be nice to see
our other brothers get back home.

886
01:35:22,581 --> 01:35:28,430
Joshua: There's something that our
father taught me of this whole thing,

887
01:35:28,496 --> 01:35:35,035
that I now need to make sure
they know, so I'll be back.

888
01:35:36,201 --> 01:35:38,213
Jeff: We'll be ready.

889
01:35:39,474 --> 01:35:41,760
Joshua: The Johnson boys together again.

890
01:35:41,826 --> 01:35:44,415
Jeff: Together again.

891
01:35:44,481 --> 01:35:46,187
Joshua: Watching each other's
backs, just like old times, huh?

892
01:35:46,253 --> 01:35:47,923
Jeff: Just like old times.

893
01:35:47,989 --> 01:35:51,304
Joshua: Hey, how ya
doin', after that beating?

894
01:35:51,370 --> 01:35:51,998
Jeff: I'm doin' fine.

895
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,474
Joshua: You doin' okay?
Jeff: Yeah.

896
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:54,351
Joshua: Your leg still botherin' you?

897
01:35:54,417 --> 01:35:57,662
Jeff: A little bit; I'm not doin'
too bad; I'm gettin' better.

898
01:35:58,938 --> 01:36:03,186
It did bother me a little bit, but
what really makes me feel better

899
01:36:03,252 --> 01:36:05,645
is the hurtin' that we
put on them two old boys.

900
01:36:05,711 --> 01:36:09,264
Joshua: Yeah, that's good
medicine right there, yeah.

901
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:11,176
Jeff: laughs

902
01:36:11,242 --> 01:36:13,976
Joshua: It's been a crazy few months, huh?

903
01:36:14,042 --> 01:36:15,408
Jeff: Mm hmm.

904
01:36:15,474 --> 01:36:16,413
Joshua: You know?

905
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:17,894
Jeff: Fun-packed!

906
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:18,712
Joshua: It's been a blast.

907
01:36:18,778 --> 01:36:20,386
Jeff: I don't know; might be
kinda scary next time you come up.

908
01:36:20,452 --> 01:36:22,470
Joshua: Oh, I don't think so.

909
01:36:22,536 --> 01:36:23,533
Jeff: We had so much fun this time.

910
01:36:23,599 --> 01:36:26,053
Joshua: I'm ready for it, you know?

911
01:36:26,119 --> 01:36:29,212
Jeff: We'll get all of us
together this time; we'll be good.

912
01:36:29,278 --> 01:36:37,278
(dramatic music)

913
01:36:38,443 --> 01:36:46,442
(rushing water)

914
01:36:46,759 --> 01:36:54,759
(dramatic music)

915
01:41:18,617 --> 01:41:21,356
Jeff: From the smoke -
did you see that or not?

916
01:41:21,422 --> 01:41:22,805
Voiceover:: At what point, though?

917
01:41:22,871 --> 01:41:26,845
Jeff: When you're shootin' Eric and me,
is there smoke, kinda like a haze here?

918
01:41:26,911 --> 01:41:29,790
Voiceover: I don't remember.

919
01:41:29,856 --> 01:41:32,078
Right now, you mean?

920
01:41:32,144 --> 01:41:33,598
Jeff: Yeah.

921
01:41:33,664 --> 01:41:35,863
Voiceover: I don't know.

922
01:41:35,929 --> 01:41:37,590
Jeff: Well, you'd know right away, so -
Voiceover: Look at each other.

923
01:41:37,656 --> 01:41:38,506
Jeff: Look at each other?

924
01:41:38,572 --> 01:41:40,012
Voiceover: Yeah.

925
01:41:40,078 --> 01:41:41,546
Jeff: Hey, baby.

926
01:41:41,612 --> 01:41:43,445
How you doin'?

927
01:41:43,511 --> 01:41:44,794
Joshua: Come here often?

928
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:46,351
Where have you been all my life?

929
01:41:46,417 --> 01:41:49,327
Jeff: You at McDonald's
today, 'cause I'm lovin' it!

930
01:41:49,942 --> 01:41:55,326
Joshua: You know, if I could rearrange
the alphabet, I'd put U and I together.

931
01:41:55,392 --> 01:41:58,183
Jeff: I never heard that one.

932
01:41:58,249 --> 01:42:00,325
Joshua: Never, really?

933
01:42:00,391 --> 01:42:02,532
Jeff: Oh, man!

934
01:42:02,598 --> 01:42:05,296
Joshua: That is THE classic one.

935
01:42:05,362 --> 01:42:08,162
Jeff: That's good; I heard that
McDonald's one on a bus down in Juneau.
