1
00:00:11,683 --> 00:00:14,433
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,540
(suspenseful music)

3
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:47,440
- [Man] It's just a few more
miles, don't be so squeamish.

4
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,264
It's gonna be a breeze.

5
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:52,264
(suspenseful music)

6
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:16,825
It doesn't feel right.

7
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:19,179
After all, we are the law.

8
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:22,171
(woman speaking indistinctly over radio)

9
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:25,390
(dramatic music)

10
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,557
(woman speaking indistinctly over radio)

11
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:29,768
But the world does not need these dudes.

12
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:31,061
Don't quit on me now.

13
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:32,739
Remember this money's ours.

14
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:34,357
We're the ones with our asses on the line.

15
00:03:34,357 --> 00:03:38,980
If we score now, they're
gonna lose us in a panic.

16
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,980
(suspenseful music)

17
00:03:56,952 --> 00:03:58,277
Payoff is one thing,

18
00:03:58,277 --> 00:04:01,509
but collecting it by deadly force...

19
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:05,157
(suspenseful music)

20
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:09,541
(woman speaking indistinctly over radio)

21
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,413
- I'm not laying down for this.

22
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:13,637
Let's get the money and
we're finished with this guy.

23
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:15,429
- Let's call for some back up first.

24
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:16,431
- Back up?

25
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:18,520
How are we gonna explain this?

26
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,520
(suspenseful music)

27
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:25,526
(wind blows)

28
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:40,402
(man groans)

29
00:04:40,402 --> 00:04:43,152
(dramatic music)

30
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:45,826
- Fuck.

31
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:49,718
(man grunts)

32
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:52,456
- Want it?

33
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:57,632
We're good to you, you piece of shit.

34
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:59,489
(man groans)

35
00:04:59,489 --> 00:05:02,657
(dramatic music)

36
00:05:02,657 --> 00:05:05,074
I've had enough of your shit.

37
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,010
- Boss.

38
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,010
- What?

39
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,945
- They're cops.

40
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,695
(dramatic music)

41
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,379
(guns firing)

42
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:16,039
- God, no, no.

43
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:19,974
(dramatic music)

44
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:25,102
God, no, no.

45
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:29,381
(dramatic music)

46
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,039
God, no, no.

47
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:36,261
(gun fires)

48
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:44,844
(guns firing)

49
00:06:50,216 --> 00:06:53,225
(man groans)

50
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:55,975
(dramatic music)

51
00:06:57,735 --> 00:07:00,235
(guns firing)

52
00:07:21,913 --> 00:07:24,663
(dramatic music)

53
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:37,320
(suspenseful music)

54
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,487
(gun fires)
(groans)

55
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:53,230
(groans)

56
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:57,409
(suspenseful music)

57
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:02,288
- Can't wait for your fucking money?

58
00:08:02,288 --> 00:08:03,784
- Don't do it, man.

59
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,656
- Shut the fuck up.

60
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:07,894
Fuckers should know better by now

61
00:08:07,894 --> 00:08:10,224
not to fuck with me.

62
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:12,808
You're the last one here.

63
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:15,891
You're all by yourself, motherfucker.

64
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,152
Huh?

65
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:20,391
You and I are gonna party, boy.

66
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:21,686
I'll be back for you.

67
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:24,686
(suspenseful music)

68
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,047
Get the goods.

69
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:43,821
I'll take care of this son of a bitch.

70
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:46,821
(suspenseful music)

71
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:54,657
(man groans)

72
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:57,657
(suspenseful music)

73
00:08:58,558 --> 00:09:00,974
How 'bout you and I go for a ride?

74
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:04,222
I bet you ain't never had
a ride like this one, boy.

75
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:07,222
(suspenseful music)

76
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,919
(engine revs)

77
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:19,406
(suspenseful music)

78
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,875
(man screams)

79
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:27,603
I'll give you a fucking ride.

80
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:31,192
(man groans)

81
00:09:42,663 --> 00:09:45,663
(suspenseful music)

82
00:09:51,611 --> 00:09:53,944
(gun fires)

83
00:09:55,272 --> 00:09:58,022
(dramatic music)

84
00:10:23,942 --> 00:10:26,359
(man groans)

85
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:30,841
- Come on, silver boy.

86
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:32,457
We don't wanna be late for
our little fishing trip

87
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:34,427
with Mr. Jacoby.

88
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:37,420
Now get your ass up off
the ground right now.

89
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,170
(dramatic music)

90
00:10:50,522 --> 00:10:53,401
- Hey, what the hell's going on here, huh?

91
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:55,834
You guys are making a
big mistake, you know.

92
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:57,642
Once the boss man finds out
what you're doing to me,

93
00:10:57,642 --> 00:11:00,746
he's gonna be pissed and mad, really mad,

94
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:01,748
so I suggest you--

95
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,434
- Shut up and walk.

96
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:06,184
(dramatic music)

97
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,434
- [Man] Tell me, I gotta carry him.

98
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:23,033
- Oh, yeah.

99
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:25,499
- Lighten up, homie.

100
00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:28,314
- Drag him up.
- Oh, yeah.

101
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:31,064
(dramatic music)

102
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:36,842
(groans)

103
00:11:36,842 --> 00:11:39,592
(dramatic music)

104
00:11:41,627 --> 00:11:45,673
(groans)
(dramatic music)

105
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:46,673
- [Man] Hey, kid.

106
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,306
Go tell Mr. Jacoby we
got Silver Boy, here.

107
00:11:49,306 --> 00:11:50,570
You hear the man or what, dude?

108
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,299
- You have something so fucking important

109
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:55,163
to tell Mr. Jacoby, tell him yourself.

110
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:56,938
He's in the back cabin.

111
00:11:56,938 --> 00:11:58,938
- [Man] Kid, go get him.

112
00:12:00,796 --> 00:12:02,746
(knocks)

113
00:12:02,746 --> 00:12:05,018
- Who the fuck is it?

114
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:08,685
- Mr. Jacoby, we got
Silver here to see you.

115
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,166
- Give me my robe.

116
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:25,114
Simon.

117
00:12:30,714 --> 00:12:31,881
What an honor.

118
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:37,789
First, I was upset, now I'm happy.

119
00:12:41,757 --> 00:12:44,793
Laying odds against
seeing you on this boat.

120
00:12:44,793 --> 00:12:45,876
Unbelievable.

121
00:12:47,593 --> 00:12:49,791
- Why do you say these things to me, huh?

122
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,750
And why you treat me like this?

123
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,856
Somebody's been telling you lies.

124
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:58,882
I thought I was your boy, huh?

125
00:12:58,882 --> 00:13:00,591
How far we go back?

126
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:03,343
And now I'm hearing a
rumor about your short

127
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:04,913
on your collections,

128
00:13:04,913 --> 00:13:07,641
and you think I'm on the take.

129
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:08,800
It wasn't me, boss.

130
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,641
I wouldn't do that to you.

131
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:13,641
Somebody's trying to set me up here.

132
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:17,632
I'm serious--
- Shut up.

133
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:19,715
- It wasn't me.
- Shut up.

134
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,977
Shut the fuck up.

135
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,950
(dramatic music)

136
00:13:27,393 --> 00:13:29,310
Too many women for you,

137
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,242
and they make men greedy.

138
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,596
Too powerful.

139
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:42,464
Delilah to Samson,
Cleopatra to Marc Anthony,

140
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:45,233
you are a fallen victim now.

141
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:46,560
- It wasn't me, boss.

142
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,080
I swear it wasn't me.

143
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,997
- Aww, shh.

144
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:53,513
Don't piss me off more than I already am.

145
00:13:56,832 --> 00:13:58,249
You need a drink.

146
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,307
Honey, champagne.

147
00:14:05,713 --> 00:14:09,274
- Is there a problem, sweetheart?

148
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:12,191
- Nothing that doesn't concern you.

149
00:14:15,713 --> 00:14:17,743
- [Silver] I'm telling you, I was set up,

150
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:19,184
and I did not do his.

151
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:20,562
I wouldn't do that to you.

152
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:22,896
- I'm telling you you're thirsty.

153
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,229
Drink, drink it.

154
00:14:30,113 --> 00:14:30,946
Good boy.

155
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:36,208
- You gotta believe me.

156
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,708
Things have been really slow, I'm serious.

157
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:45,199
(dramatic music)

158
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,208
Sit down.

159
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:52,157
(dramatic music)

160
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:57,848
- No, boss.

161
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,570
Please, please.

162
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:04,707
(groans)

163
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:06,385
Oh, fuck.

164
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:13,621
(groans)

165
00:15:15,505 --> 00:15:16,338
Oh, fuck.

166
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:18,497
- You owe me.

167
00:15:20,681 --> 00:15:22,118
- My face, man.

168
00:15:22,118 --> 00:15:25,238
Why'd you have to scar
me up like this, huh?

169
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:28,246
Jeez, I told you, I didn't do it.

170
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:29,079
God.

171
00:15:34,422 --> 00:15:36,710
- Go check the kid outside.

172
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,043
Get out of here.

173
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:46,087
- You fucked me up so good, man.

174
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:48,004
Thought I was your boy.

175
00:15:49,286 --> 00:15:53,142
- [Jacoby] You ain't shit
you're weakling little baby.

176
00:15:53,142 --> 00:15:54,551
Does it hurt?

177
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:56,301
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

178
00:15:57,141 --> 00:15:58,641
Here, here, relax.

179
00:16:00,646 --> 00:16:02,245
Here's how's this?

180
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:03,078
- Ow.

181
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,709
- You take that shipment up to Billy,

182
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:17,799
and you tell him, if it doesn't happen,

183
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:20,278
he's gonna look like him.

184
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:21,195
You got it?

185
00:16:24,725 --> 00:16:27,734
Nobody wants to look like him.

186
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:30,070
(phone rings)

187
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:30,903
- Hello?

188
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:34,681
It's Billy.

189
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,166
- Jacoby, what's going on?

190
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,551
You said we'd be finished
here in two months.

191
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:43,766
Here it is, six months later,

192
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:46,234
we're still jerking off in this shit hole.

193
00:16:46,234 --> 00:16:48,484
(laughing)

194
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,462
- Listen to me, you little fuck.

195
00:16:53,462 --> 00:16:56,838
I've been taking care of you
since you were a punk kid,

196
00:16:56,838 --> 00:16:58,727
and that's all you are.

197
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,382
Your family doesn't even
give a shit about you.

198
00:17:01,382 --> 00:17:02,549
- Yeah, right.

199
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,829
- So you listen to me.

200
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:10,550
One more fuck up like that in
the desert and you're history.

201
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:15,463
- If it doesn't happen in
two weeks, we're out of here.

202
00:17:15,463 --> 00:17:16,963
- You little fuck.

203
00:17:18,342 --> 00:17:19,574
I swear, if he doesn't does this,

204
00:17:19,574 --> 00:17:24,486
they won't be able to wipe
down a file in forensics.

205
00:17:24,486 --> 00:17:25,819
- Yeah, tell me.

206
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,298
Take it easy.

207
00:17:31,525 --> 00:17:34,275
(dramatic music)

208
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:46,210
(groaning)

209
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,960
(dramatic music)

210
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:53,840
- [Crowd] Get him!

211
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
Yeah, get up, come on, get up.

212
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,872
Yeah, get him, oh!

213
00:17:57,872 --> 00:18:00,112
Get up, get up, come on.

214
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,779
Yeah, hit him, yeah, yeah, yeah.

215
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:06,229
Go, go, go.

216
00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:07,396
Come on, yeah.

217
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:13,205
Hit him, hit him, hit him, yeah.

218
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,227
Go, go, go.

219
00:18:16,277 --> 00:18:17,444
Come on, yeah.

220
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,784
(dog growls)

221
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:28,991
(cars honking)

222
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,302
- [Man] Here, I'll give you a hand.

223
00:18:37,302 --> 00:18:38,135
- Thanks.

224
00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:53,741
I wish you'd reconsider my invitation.

225
00:18:55,649 --> 00:18:57,790
Are you sure I can't change your mind?

226
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,046
- No, I need the bucks.

227
00:19:00,046 --> 00:19:01,331
- Well, I gotta get going.

228
00:19:01,331 --> 00:19:02,558
- All right, you take care of yourself.

229
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,558
- [Woman] Okay, you too.

230
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:11,871
(cheerful music)

231
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:09,115
- Hiya, ma'am, can I fill her up for you?

232
00:20:09,115 --> 00:20:10,365
- Yeah, please.

233
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,723
Could you tell me how to
get up state route 56?

234
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,084
I couldn't find it on my map.

235
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:26,221
- Route 56?

236
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:27,224
- Uh huh.

237
00:20:27,224 --> 00:20:28,225
- [Attendant] How far you going?

238
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:29,551
- To the base of the volcano.

239
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:30,557
- That's not a good idea.

240
00:20:30,557 --> 00:20:32,354
There's some bad old
boys that live up there.

241
00:20:32,354 --> 00:20:33,356
- Well, I have a government grant

242
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:34,851
to research the area, so those boys

243
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:37,003
are just gonna have to
learn to live with it.

244
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:39,586
(upbeat music)

245
00:20:49,645 --> 00:20:50,562
- Hi, Jake.

246
00:20:51,837 --> 00:20:52,670
- Howdy.

247
00:20:53,597 --> 00:20:56,180
(upbeat music)

248
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:07,481
(crowd cheers)

249
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:25,160
- Boy, you really think
you're a stud, don't you?

250
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,680
- Hey, man, it was easy money.

251
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,683
- Good to see you.

252
00:21:27,683 --> 00:21:29,080
You got that gear ready for
that hunting trip tomorrow?

253
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,730
- You bet, I can't wait.

254
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,712
- Sounds like we just better
head up there in the morning.

255
00:21:32,712 --> 00:21:33,713
- [Friend] Yeah.

256
00:21:33,713 --> 00:21:34,713
- Hey, babe.

257
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:37,986
(laughing)

258
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,857
- Hey, what the hell's going on here, huh?

259
00:21:40,857 --> 00:21:42,808
- What's going on here?

260
00:21:42,808 --> 00:21:46,975
(grunting)
(punches landing)

261
00:22:04,014 --> 00:22:06,597
(upbeat music)

262
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:32,887
- Hey, man, I think it's
time for that hunting trip.

263
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:35,637
(crowd shouting)

264
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:39,272
(upbeat music)

265
00:22:39,272 --> 00:22:41,772
(engine revs)

266
00:24:03,727 --> 00:24:05,234
(laughing)

267
00:24:05,234 --> 00:24:06,690
- Hey, that was close that time.

268
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,034
You boys are getting better.

269
00:24:08,034 --> 00:24:09,666
- Man, you made me dent my bumper.

270
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,058
You're gonna kill us one of these days.

271
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:12,180
- When the hell you gonna grow up?

272
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,004
You could have killed me, you dumb shit.

273
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:15,026
- What are you sniveling about?

274
00:24:15,026 --> 00:24:16,945
You wreck your bike every other race.

275
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:18,193
Come on, guys.

276
00:24:18,193 --> 00:24:19,811
Let's head on up to the
hill and set up camp

277
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:21,618
fore it gets too dark,
you want a cold beer?

278
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:23,382
- Now you're talking, toss me one.

279
00:24:23,382 --> 00:24:26,754
- It's the least you can do
for making me crash my bike.

280
00:24:26,754 --> 00:24:28,802
(laughing)

281
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:31,302
(engine revs)

282
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,351
(birds chirping)

283
00:25:14,564 --> 00:25:16,064
- Home sweet home.

284
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:20,546
(birds chirping)

285
00:25:22,534 --> 00:25:25,117
(gentle music)

286
00:25:45,953 --> 00:25:50,177
You know, Johnny, humans
aren't loners by nature.

287
00:25:50,177 --> 00:25:54,094
Here I am in botanist
heaven and it's so quiet.

288
00:25:55,376 --> 00:25:59,361
You would think I would
be used to the outdoors.

289
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:02,146
You know, every time I
come to a place like this,

290
00:26:02,146 --> 00:26:04,737
it feels like the first time.

291
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:06,904
Do you ever feel that way?

292
00:26:08,337 --> 00:26:11,345
I remember when Dad showed
you how to use the gun.

293
00:26:11,345 --> 00:26:13,856
You were shaking like a leaf.

294
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:16,803
Seemed like it took an
hour to pull the trigger,

295
00:26:16,803 --> 00:26:20,241
and you were squinting your eyes so tight,

296
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:22,574
I bet you couldn't even see.

297
00:26:24,371 --> 00:26:27,954
Did it ever get easier
to pull the trigger?

298
00:26:30,705 --> 00:26:31,809
You've already used up enough lives

299
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:33,809
to make any cat jealous.

300
00:26:34,673 --> 00:26:37,572
I think you should visit
as soon as possible.

301
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:39,504
Besides, it would do your ego some good

302
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:42,921
to be your little sister's lab assistant.

303
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:46,616
It's too quiet up here, Johnny.

304
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:54,821
(engine revs)

305
00:27:12,137 --> 00:27:14,887
(birds chirping)

306
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:19,199
(engine revs)

307
00:27:24,216 --> 00:27:26,966
(birds chirping)

308
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:45,892
(engine revs)

309
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:51,152
(birds chirping)

310
00:27:55,642 --> 00:27:56,725
- [Man] Woah.

311
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:00,599
(birds chirping)

312
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,310
(engine revs)

313
00:28:21,627 --> 00:28:24,091
(birds chirping)

314
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:26,591
(engine revs)

315
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,233
(horses trotting)

316
00:28:54,475 --> 00:28:57,142
(engine stalls)

317
00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:02,509
(horses trotting)

318
00:29:03,612 --> 00:29:06,112
(engine revs)

319
00:29:15,693 --> 00:29:18,526
(horses trotting)

320
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:41,178
- Hey, Billy.

321
00:29:41,178 --> 00:29:43,192
How things holding out up here?

322
00:29:43,192 --> 00:29:44,457
You ain't looking so well.

323
00:29:44,457 --> 00:29:46,360
- Cut the shit, I'm fine.

324
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,714
You're four months overdue on our deal.

325
00:29:48,714 --> 00:29:51,193
- Takis, Mr. Jacoby sends his best,

326
00:29:51,193 --> 00:29:53,547
and he apologizes for the inconvenience.

327
00:29:53,547 --> 00:29:55,548
- I don't give a damn
about the inconvenience.

328
00:29:55,548 --> 00:29:56,715
Get the goods.

329
00:29:58,281 --> 00:30:01,031
(birds chirping)

330
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:16,652
Not as good as last time.

331
00:30:17,865 --> 00:30:20,532
Getting real tired of this shit.

332
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:23,736
Put that away.

333
00:30:26,985 --> 00:30:29,929
(branch snaps)

334
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,288
- Expecting company?

335
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,665
- I'll take care of it.

336
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,665
- No, probably just some kid from town.

337
00:30:34,665 --> 00:30:36,696
I'll be right back.

338
00:30:36,696 --> 00:30:40,408
(horse whinnies, gallops)

339
00:30:40,408 --> 00:30:42,106
- Mr. Jacoby is concerned.

340
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:45,523
Don't let things get out of control here.

341
00:30:52,746 --> 00:30:55,496
(dramatic music)

342
00:31:46,497 --> 00:31:48,747
(groaning)

343
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,464
- Well, what do we have here?

344
00:31:54,464 --> 00:31:56,162
- But I didn't see anything.

345
00:31:56,162 --> 00:31:58,880
- Shut your fucking mouth.

346
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,713
- No.

347
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:03,035
(groaning)

348
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:09,028
No.

349
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:12,929
(dramatic music)

350
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:15,096
(screams)

351
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,812
(fire crackles)

352
00:32:22,848 --> 00:32:25,765
(insects chirping)

353
00:32:31,764 --> 00:32:32,766
- Hey, you guys wanna head up

354
00:32:32,766 --> 00:32:34,113
the Devil's Ridge in the morning?

355
00:32:34,113 --> 00:32:35,873
Some pretty big game up there.

356
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:37,009
- If we're gonna go all the way up there,

357
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:38,629
we'd better plan on staying the night.

358
00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:39,797
It's a long hike.

359
00:32:39,797 --> 00:32:41,169
- Shit, I'll just ride my bike.

360
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:42,669
You guys can walk.

361
00:32:43,601 --> 00:32:44,601
- Listen to you, guys.

362
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:47,697
You sound like a couple damn pansies.

363
00:32:47,697 --> 00:32:50,288
(insects chirping)

364
00:32:50,288 --> 00:32:51,455
What the hell?

365
00:32:52,832 --> 00:32:54,353
- Help me.

366
00:32:54,353 --> 00:32:56,615
He might still be after me.

367
00:32:56,615 --> 00:32:58,402
- [Man] What's going on, who's after you?

368
00:32:58,402 --> 00:33:01,333
- There's a man, a man on a horse.

369
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:03,361
He tried to kill me.

370
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:05,281
- Oh, come on, sit over here and sit down.

371
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:06,929
Sit down.

372
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:10,177
(dramatic music)

373
00:33:10,177 --> 00:33:11,281
- We oughta get her to town.

374
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,177
She don't have no business being
up here in the first place.

375
00:33:14,177 --> 00:33:16,737
- What do you mean I have
no business being up here?

376
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:17,857
Are you telling me men are the only

377
00:33:17,857 --> 00:33:19,809
ones allowed in the mountains?

378
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:21,204
- He's not saying that.

379
00:33:21,204 --> 00:33:23,153
Just some bad boys live in these hills.

380
00:33:23,153 --> 00:33:24,657
It's just not a safe place.

381
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:28,929
- Yeah, it looked like they
were dropping drugs from a boat,

382
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:31,265
and a man on a horse
noticed me watching him,

383
00:33:31,265 --> 00:33:33,713
and he started chasing me,

384
00:33:33,713 --> 00:33:36,130
and then he tried to rape me.

385
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,725
(dramatic music)

386
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:49,973
- All right, here's a song
I wrote for my ex-wife.

387
00:33:49,973 --> 00:33:52,140
She's out there somewhere.

388
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,065
(country music)

389
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,322
- Hello, Joy, how 'bout a
little company at my place?

390
00:34:03,322 --> 00:34:05,866
- I'm not blind, Dave.

391
00:34:05,866 --> 00:34:09,084
♫ Come here at night

392
00:34:09,084 --> 00:34:10,826
Hey, Elmo, why don't you cut Dave off?

393
00:34:10,826 --> 00:34:13,326
(engine revs)

394
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,578
- My mom owns this place.

395
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:29,578
♫ But the winds of old December

396
00:34:31,257 --> 00:34:35,081
♫ Cold as they can be

397
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:36,186
Hey, Mom, I need your help.

398
00:34:36,186 --> 00:34:37,337
This is Saundra.

399
00:34:37,337 --> 00:34:38,410
I didn't catch your last name.

400
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,521
- It's Ryker, Saundra Ryker.

401
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:41,802
- What happened to you?

402
00:34:41,802 --> 00:34:43,593
- She ran into Billy and
there's some bad shit

403
00:34:43,593 --> 00:34:45,093
going on up there.

404
00:34:46,346 --> 00:34:48,267
- Hi, hon, who's your new friend?

405
00:34:48,267 --> 00:34:49,578
- This is Saundra Ryker.

406
00:34:49,578 --> 00:34:52,411
She ran into Billy up on the hill.

407
00:34:53,274 --> 00:34:55,642
It isn't all, she stabbed him.

408
00:34:55,642 --> 00:34:56,650
- Is he dead?

409
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,970
- He was moving when I ran away.

410
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,138
Could I use your phone?

411
00:35:00,138 --> 00:35:03,034
I really need to call my brother.

412
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,138
- Let's get her out of here.

413
00:35:04,138 --> 00:35:05,866
Myrna, will you take her back to my place

414
00:35:05,866 --> 00:35:07,370
and get her cleaned up?

415
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:10,787
♫ And her memory remains

416
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:17,893
(dramatic music)

417
00:35:17,893 --> 00:35:18,893
- Oh, Jesus.

418
00:35:20,182 --> 00:35:22,516
- Man, Billy, you gotta get to a doctor.

419
00:35:22,516 --> 00:35:24,692
- Bullshit, fucking doctors.

420
00:35:24,692 --> 00:35:25,878
What are you stupid?

421
00:35:25,878 --> 00:35:28,602
- Jesus Christ, you don't
have to jump down my throat.

422
00:35:28,602 --> 00:35:29,621
- You'd better watch your shit,

423
00:35:29,621 --> 00:35:31,621
always out fucking guys.

424
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:35,582
(sultry music)

425
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,413
You don't want it.

426
00:35:39,413 --> 00:35:43,002
Leave me alone.
- Yeah, just a little.

427
00:35:43,002 --> 00:35:43,835
- Take it.

428
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,581
(sultry music)

429
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:49,748
Come on, here.

430
00:35:50,598 --> 00:35:51,972
Come on.

431
00:35:51,972 --> 00:35:52,805
- Come on.

432
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:58,507
(moaning)
(sultry music)

433
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,170
- You're a freak, so not yet.

434
00:36:16,035 --> 00:36:18,618
(sultry music)

435
00:37:26,012 --> 00:37:30,179
- Takis, bring me that stuff
from the shipment today.

436
00:37:31,927 --> 00:37:34,844
(insects chirping)

437
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:58,607
Here, have some, we have work tonight.

438
00:37:58,607 --> 00:38:00,111
That bitch is gonna pay.

439
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,028
- No, boss.

440
00:38:02,353 --> 00:38:04,864
- All right, I guess it's just as well.

441
00:38:04,864 --> 00:38:06,697
Need you on your toes.

442
00:38:13,727 --> 00:38:17,761
Go round up some of the
boys, going to town.

443
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:18,594
Do it.

444
00:38:19,744 --> 00:38:22,661
(insects chirping)

445
00:38:26,992 --> 00:38:29,992

(phone dials)

447
00:38:45,297 --> 00:38:48,880
- [Woman] Hello, you've
reach 805-648-7611.

448
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,311
(beep)

449
00:38:51,311 --> 00:38:54,144
- Johnny, are you there, Johnny?

450
00:38:54,144 --> 00:38:55,644
Pick up the phone.

451
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:01,417
- Will you be okay?

452
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:03,840
I need to go close the restaurant.

453
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,385
- Johnny, are you there?

454
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:10,552
♫ Three years old beneath
the stars, oh dear

455
00:39:15,393 --> 00:39:18,476
(applause, cheering)

456
00:39:23,233 --> 00:39:25,650
(horn honks)

457
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,540
- Hey, Jake.

458
00:39:45,043 --> 00:39:46,543
Where's the bitch?

459
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,836
Her and I have some unsettled
business there, Jake.

460
00:39:52,836 --> 00:39:53,837
- I have to deal with this.

461
00:39:53,837 --> 00:39:55,156
He won't just go away.

462
00:39:55,156 --> 00:39:56,489
- Come on, Jake.

463
00:39:57,747 --> 00:40:00,999
Don't make me wait any longer.

464
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:03,780
You know how I am when I get mad.

465
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,530
- Don't go out there.

466
00:40:07,844 --> 00:40:10,177
- Don't worry, I'll be back.

467
00:40:13,692 --> 00:40:16,450
- Billy, ain't seen
you in town in a while.

468
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,548
Must be pretty important business.

469
00:40:18,548 --> 00:40:20,465
- Always a joker, Jake.

470
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:25,572
Yeah, Jake, it's pretty
important business.

471
00:40:25,572 --> 00:40:27,172
Bring the bitch out.

472
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:29,042
She's gotta pay for what she done.

473
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:30,968
- She left, Billy.

474
00:40:30,968 --> 00:40:34,756
Why don't you and the boys
just head on up to the hill.

475
00:40:34,756 --> 00:40:38,923
- You know, Jake, you always
did have a knack for bullshit.

476
00:40:40,724 --> 00:40:44,891
Bring her out or I'll level
this whole fucking town.

477
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:48,211
- Your shit don't scare me, Billy.

478
00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:49,214
You gotta problem with me,

479
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:50,564
just jump down off of the hood there

480
00:40:50,564 --> 00:40:53,287
and we'll settle this man to man.

481
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:55,537
- Gotta be a big man, Jake.

482
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,993
We can give you a fight if you want one.

483
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:05,666
(dramatic music)

484
00:41:12,521 --> 00:41:14,604
Surprise, surprise, Jake.

486
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:26,234
- Yeah.

(grunting)

489
00:41:57,436 --> 00:41:59,020

492
00:42:08,741 --> 00:42:10,037
- Get back.

493
00:42:10,037 --> 00:42:10,954

496
00:42:31,817 --> 00:42:35,298
- Could you connect me
with the local police?

497
00:42:35,298 --> 00:42:36,131
Thanks.

498
00:42:40,962 --> 00:42:43,462
(phone rings)

499
00:42:50,354 --> 00:42:54,550
There's never a cop
around when you need one.

505
00:43:12,178 --> 00:43:13,011
I know.

506
00:43:15,298 --> 00:43:17,631
I've had a rough day myself.

507

(dramatic music)

508
00:43:47,427 --> 00:43:48,927
Keep ahold of her.

509
00:43:51,602 --> 00:43:54,852
You are really starting to piss me off.

510
00:43:56,117 --> 00:43:58,367

Well, look at you, Jake.

514
00:44:41,142 --> 00:44:43,509
You got your fight.

515
00:44:43,509 --> 00:44:45,259
Hope you feel better.

516
00:44:52,598 --> 00:44:54,536
Any of you good folks get any ideas

517
00:44:54,536 --> 00:44:59,222
about being witness or
anything stupid like that,

518
00:44:59,222 --> 00:45:01,139
you better think again.

519
00:45:05,126 --> 00:45:07,350
Let's get the hell out of here.

520
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,781
This place is boring me.

522
00:45:21,734 --> 00:45:24,710

- I could do this all day.

you can't give me five more.

the agency has planned for us?

540

- You know how I feel about that?

541
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:43,412
I'm gonna retire and blow this place.

542
00:46:44,887 --> 00:46:46,534
How 'bout lunch?

543
00:46:46,534 --> 00:46:47,451
I'm buying.

544
00:46:48,504 --> 00:46:51,366
- That's a switch but I
gotta take a rain check,

545
00:46:51,366 --> 00:46:55,533
but get your stuff together
and I'll give you a lift.

you're at home on night and you hear

your next door neighbor screaming

549
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:13,876
because some sick bastard is in her house,

550
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:15,480
what are you gonna do?

551
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,509
- I'm gonna call 911 like everybody else.

552
00:47:17,509 --> 00:47:19,957
- Bullshit, you're gonna
go into your closet,

553
00:47:19,957 --> 00:47:21,477
you're gonna grab your Beretta,

554
00:47:21,477 --> 00:47:22,633
and you're going over there,

555
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:24,117
and you're gonna handle the situation

556
00:47:24,117 --> 00:47:26,284
the only way you know how.

557
00:47:58,245 --> 00:47:59,380
(phone beeps)

558
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,990
- [Man] This call is for Mr. John Ryker.

559
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:04,309
Please call Harold Henson at the office

560
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:06,245
regarding your interview.

561
00:48:06,245 --> 00:48:08,162
The number is 855-1439.

562
00:48:09,878 --> 00:48:12,375
(phone beeps)

563
00:48:12,375 --> 00:48:15,317
- [Woman] Johnny, are you there, Johnny?

564
00:48:15,317 --> 00:48:16,817
Pick up the phone.

565
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:20,351
- [Waitress] Will you be okay?

566
00:48:20,351 --> 00:48:22,708
I need to go close the restaurant.

567
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:24,790
- [Woman] Johnny, are you there?

568
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:26,340
I need your help.

569
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,345
(dramatic music)

570
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:28,178
- Oh shit.

571
00:48:30,038 --> 00:48:32,455
(wind blows)

572
00:48:56,766 --> 00:48:57,766
- Hey, baby.

573
00:49:00,176 --> 00:49:01,093
Sleep good?

574
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:06,913
Oh, the silent treatment.

575
00:49:08,588 --> 00:49:10,755
Gosh, honey, don't be mad.

576
00:49:11,678 --> 00:49:13,595
I promise I'll be good.

577
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,421
(grunts)

578
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:20,171
(dramatic music)

579
00:49:25,565 --> 00:49:26,567
Give me a kiss.

580
00:49:26,567 --> 00:49:28,817
Just a little one, come on.

581
00:49:31,597 --> 00:49:33,452
Just a little one.

582
00:49:33,452 --> 00:49:35,745
(groans)

583
00:49:35,745 --> 00:49:37,495
You know you like it.

584
00:49:39,549 --> 00:49:42,845
You really need to trust me, you know?

585
00:49:42,845 --> 00:49:43,678
Yeah.

586
00:49:44,589 --> 00:49:45,422
Come on.

587
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,717
Oh, how 'bout this?

588
00:49:48,717 --> 00:49:49,884
You like this?

589
00:49:51,373 --> 00:49:52,926
Yeah.

590
00:49:52,926 --> 00:49:55,678
How 'bout another kiss, huh?

591
00:49:55,678 --> 00:49:57,761
(grunts)

592
00:50:01,313 --> 00:50:02,146
Come on.

593
00:50:03,966 --> 00:50:06,461
(laughs)

594
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,806
Looks like it's gonna
take a little more time

595
00:50:07,806 --> 00:50:09,723
for you to come around.

596
00:50:10,849 --> 00:50:13,599
When really, you should trust me.

597
00:50:14,797 --> 00:50:18,334
Before you know it, you
and I will be good friends.

598
00:50:18,334 --> 00:50:20,417
(grunts)

599
00:50:37,914 --> 00:50:40,664
(water splashes)

600
00:50:41,899 --> 00:50:44,816
(insects chirping)

601
00:51:08,602 --> 00:51:10,538
- Here, take this.

602
00:51:10,538 --> 00:51:11,871
You need to eat.

603
00:51:13,162 --> 00:51:13,995
- Hey.

604
00:51:15,098 --> 00:51:18,394
How am I supposed to eat this?

605
00:51:18,394 --> 00:51:21,898
Could you at least untie me
so I can eat like a human?

606
00:51:21,898 --> 00:51:25,065
- Yeah, I guess I could untie one arm.

607
00:51:27,002 --> 00:51:28,970
You try anything, I swear to God,

608
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:31,387
I'll break your fucking neck.

609
00:51:33,976 --> 00:51:35,393
Nothing personal.

610
00:51:36,346 --> 00:51:37,179
- I won't.

611
00:51:38,602 --> 00:51:41,519
(insects chirping)

612
00:51:47,678 --> 00:51:51,678
Why do you put up with
his animalistic behavior?

613
00:51:52,664 --> 00:51:53,947
- Billy's good to me.

614
00:51:53,947 --> 00:51:55,386
- Yeah, sure.

615
00:51:55,386 --> 00:51:57,018
I see the way he treats you.

616
00:51:57,018 --> 00:51:59,562
No woman wants to be treated like that.

617
00:51:59,562 --> 00:52:02,479
- Okay, so he's a little different.

618
00:52:04,058 --> 00:52:06,056
He's not that bad all the time.

619
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:08,567
- Just most of the time.

620
00:52:08,567 --> 00:52:11,073
- Look, why don't you
just finish your grub,

621
00:52:11,073 --> 00:52:13,121
all right and stay out of my business?

622
00:52:13,121 --> 00:52:15,023
- You know, we could get
out of here, if you wanted.

623
00:52:15,023 --> 00:52:16,949
- What are you, crazy?

624
00:52:16,949 --> 00:52:18,001
Don't even talk like that.

625
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:19,393
If Billy thought that I'd try to help you

626
00:52:19,393 --> 00:52:21,105
out of here, he'd kill me.

627
00:52:21,105 --> 00:52:23,715
- After dark, all these guys
are just a bunch of drunks.

628
00:52:23,715 --> 00:52:26,067
We could start a new life.

629
00:52:26,067 --> 00:52:27,857
- Forget it, all right,

630
00:52:27,857 --> 00:52:29,457
and why should I help you anyway?

631
00:52:29,457 --> 00:52:30,784
- The way I see it, Billy has his sights

632
00:52:30,784 --> 00:52:32,594
set on someone else.

633
00:52:32,594 --> 00:52:34,561
- All right, so he's going
through a little shit right now.

634
00:52:34,561 --> 00:52:35,728
Okay, don't get your hopes up, huh?

635
00:52:35,728 --> 00:52:40,385
- You know I stabbed him
because he tried to rape me.

636
00:52:40,385 --> 00:52:42,545
- All right, that's
enough, I've heard enough.

637
00:52:42,545 --> 00:52:44,513
Come on, now give me your arm.

638
00:52:44,513 --> 00:52:45,930
Give me your arm.

639
00:52:47,684 --> 00:52:49,986
Come on, put your arm back here.

640
00:52:49,986 --> 00:52:51,486
You're pushing it.

641
00:52:57,297 --> 00:52:58,687
- If you keep letting
him treat you like that,

642
00:52:58,687 --> 00:53:00,527
later, you'll wish you had listened to me.

643
00:53:00,527 --> 00:53:01,601
- Look, if I were you, I'd just worry

644
00:53:01,601 --> 00:53:03,684
about your own situation.

645
00:53:04,799 --> 00:53:09,057
- Thanks for not tying the ropes as tight.

646
00:53:09,057 --> 00:53:11,974
(insects chirping)

647
00:53:20,593 --> 00:53:22,209
- Hey, baby.

648
00:53:22,209 --> 00:53:23,759
Come to Papa.

649
00:53:23,759 --> 00:53:25,777
Mr. Happy is starting to get restless.

650
00:53:25,777 --> 00:53:28,912
- Come on, Billy, would you be serious?

651
00:53:28,912 --> 00:53:31,662
I want something more between us.

652
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:34,109
- What, stability?

653
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,545
A relationship?

654
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,065
Sounds to me like you've been watching

655
00:53:42,065 --> 00:53:44,815
too many damn daytime talk shows.

656
00:53:48,832 --> 00:53:52,241
Why don't you go sleep
with the damn dogs tonight?

657
00:53:52,241 --> 00:53:53,158
- Fuck you.

658
00:53:56,465 --> 00:53:57,465
- Excuse me?

659
00:53:58,721 --> 00:54:00,804
I don't think I got that.

660
00:54:02,129 --> 00:54:04,001
- Well, what word didn't you get?

661
00:54:04,001 --> 00:54:05,001
Fuck or you?

662
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:11,105
(dramatic music)

663
00:54:11,105 --> 00:54:12,107
(groans)

664
00:54:12,107 --> 00:54:13,690
You son of a bitch.

665
00:54:14,564 --> 00:54:17,314
(dramatic music)

666
00:54:18,416 --> 00:54:20,499
(grunts)

667
00:54:23,345 --> 00:54:25,232
Son of a bitch.

668
00:54:25,232 --> 00:54:29,399
(grunts)
(dramatic music)

669
00:55:20,263 --> 00:55:22,930
(coughs, gasps)

670
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,410
(birds chirping)

671
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,460
(engine revs)

672
00:55:49,708 --> 00:55:52,475
- Howdy, looking for my sister.

673
00:55:52,475 --> 00:55:54,589
She came up here a few days
ago to study the volcano.

674
00:55:54,589 --> 00:55:55,756
Have you seen her?

675
00:55:55,756 --> 00:55:57,867
- There was a girl up
looking for directions.

676
00:55:57,867 --> 00:55:59,297
- Where is she at right now?

677
00:55:59,297 --> 00:56:01,004
- Well, if it's the same girl,

678
00:56:01,004 --> 00:56:02,988
she had a run in with
the boys up on the hill.

679
00:56:02,988 --> 00:56:04,508
- Up on the hill, what hill?

680
00:56:04,508 --> 00:56:08,972
- Up at the base of the
volcano, up route 56.

681
00:56:08,972 --> 00:56:10,076
- Thanks a lot.

682
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:11,159
- You betcha.

683
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,395
(suspenseful music)

684
00:56:14,395 --> 00:56:16,895
(engine revs)

685
00:56:28,797 --> 00:56:30,413
- Shh.

686
00:56:30,413 --> 00:56:33,163
(birds chirping)

687
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:35,407
Don't say a thing.

688
00:56:35,407 --> 00:56:37,574
I am so sick of this shit.

689
00:56:38,573 --> 00:56:43,229
Only way out of here is
an old truck up the road.

690
00:56:43,229 --> 00:56:45,979
(birds chirping)

691
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:54,365
(engine revs)

692
00:56:54,365 --> 00:56:56,948
(lively music)

693
00:57:05,613 --> 00:57:07,020
- They're gone.

694
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,700
- Find them.

695
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,283
(lively music)

696
00:57:18,176 --> 00:57:21,133
(engine revs)

697
00:57:21,133 --> 00:57:23,716
(lively music)

698
00:58:21,148 --> 00:58:24,268
(engine revs)

699
00:58:24,268 --> 00:58:26,851
(lively music)

700
00:58:29,307 --> 00:58:31,116
- Are they behind us?

701
00:58:31,116 --> 00:58:34,205
(lively music)

702
00:58:34,205 --> 00:58:36,555
- He's right behind us.

703
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:39,138
(lively music)

704
00:58:44,475 --> 00:58:47,260
(engine revs)

705
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,843
(lively music)

706
00:58:52,732 --> 00:58:53,565
Faster.

707
00:58:55,772 --> 00:58:56,605
Shit.

708
00:58:58,236 --> 00:59:00,300
(car crashes)

709
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,268
Come on, faster.

710
00:59:02,268 --> 00:59:04,851
(lively music)

711
00:59:14,364 --> 00:59:15,740
- Where are they?

712
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:18,323
(lively music)

713
00:59:19,676 --> 00:59:22,259
(tires squeal)

714
00:59:24,524 --> 00:59:27,995
- Watch it, watch it, he's gonna hit us.

715
00:59:27,995 --> 00:59:30,578
(lively music)

716
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:44,690
(engine revs)

717
00:59:58,857 --> 01:00:00,940
(grunts)

718
01:00:03,081 --> 01:00:05,400
- Well, well, ladies.

719
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,608
(grunts)

720
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:09,441
You really screwed up.

721
01:00:10,505 --> 01:00:12,745
Starting to piss me off.

722
01:00:12,745 --> 01:00:14,245
Get them in there.

723
01:00:18,409 --> 01:00:20,985
Get them back to the pit.

724
01:00:20,985 --> 01:00:23,965
Now we're gonna have some fun.

725
01:00:23,965 --> 01:00:24,882
- Fuck you.

726
01:00:25,832 --> 01:00:28,332
(engine revs)

727
01:00:30,249 --> 01:00:31,832
- [Billy] Let's go.

728
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:50,041
(engine revs)

729
01:00:54,168 --> 01:00:56,918
(birds chirping)

730
01:01:49,864 --> 01:01:52,364
(engine revs)

731
01:02:00,449 --> 01:02:03,199
(birds chirping)

732
01:02:07,985 --> 01:02:09,902
- Throw 'em in the pit.

733
01:02:12,307 --> 01:02:14,474
Come on, get 'em in there.

734
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:18,647
Lock it up.

735
01:02:19,601 --> 01:02:22,385
(birds chirping)

736
01:02:22,385 --> 01:02:24,113
You watch 'em.

(fire crackles)

740
01:03:46,876 --> 01:03:49,596

we're on guard tonight.

741

742

(groans)
(blows thudding)

753
01:06:09,576 --> 01:06:11,659
- Oh my God, it's Johnny.

754
01:06:13,382 --> 01:06:14,888
- Who the hell's Johnny?

755
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:16,440
- He's my brother.

756
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:21,161
(groans)
(blows thudding)

757
01:06:21,161 --> 01:06:24,680

a commando for a brother.

758
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,847
(groans)
(blows thudding)

(gasps)

761
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:12,068
- What is this?

762
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:16,647
Throw him in the pit.

763
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:19,653
(grunts)

764
01:07:22,752 --> 01:07:25,502
(dramatic music)

765
01:07:50,038 --> 01:07:52,018
- Nice to see you, sis.

766
01:07:52,018 --> 01:07:53,315
Seems like the only time you call me

767
01:07:53,315 --> 01:07:56,195
is when you're in trouble.

768
01:07:56,195 --> 01:07:58,112
- I'm so sorry, Johnny.

769
01:08:00,338 --> 01:08:02,807
- Look, I hate to break
up this little reunion,

770
01:08:02,807 --> 01:08:05,974
but we gotta get the hell out of here.

771
01:08:07,843 --> 01:08:09,507
- She's right.

772
01:08:09,507 --> 01:08:11,619
We have time to waste.

773
01:08:11,619 --> 01:08:16,531
Look, I left some weapons
dashed around the camp.

774
01:08:16,531 --> 01:08:17,948
Give me a minute.

775
01:08:19,699 --> 01:08:21,477
Here's what I want you guys to do.

776
01:08:21,477 --> 01:08:22,962
- Do what?

777
01:08:22,962 --> 01:08:26,195
Look, you don't know him like I know him.

778
01:08:26,195 --> 01:08:27,445
Billy's psycho.

779
01:08:28,755 --> 01:08:30,449
We could be dead by morning.

780
01:08:30,449 --> 01:08:32,712
- That's right, that's why
gotta get out of here tonight.

781
01:08:32,712 --> 01:08:35,634
- Shh, that guy is listening.

782
01:08:35,634 --> 01:08:38,384
(dramatic music)

783
01:08:46,147 --> 01:08:47,397
- Psst, Harold.

784
01:08:51,331 --> 01:08:53,971
I gotta do a bump, man.

785
01:08:53,971 --> 01:08:55,475
- What do you want, Cindy?

786
01:08:55,475 --> 01:08:57,808
- You got enough for a line?

787
01:09:02,307 --> 01:09:03,140
Ooh.

788
01:09:05,783 --> 01:09:08,450
You like it when I touch myself?

789
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:23,306
I know you've been watching me.

790
01:09:25,383 --> 01:09:29,300
It's been a long, long
time, hasn't it, Harold?

791
01:09:33,121 --> 01:09:34,961
Come on, baby, you wanna touch these?

792
01:09:34,961 --> 01:09:37,961
(suspenseful music)

793
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:53,421
Come on.

794
01:09:58,396 --> 01:09:59,229
Woah.

795
01:10:00,364 --> 01:10:02,447
(groans)

796
01:10:03,692 --> 01:10:06,692

(wind blows)
(insects chirping)

799
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,339
- Take this.

800
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:05,524
Okay, Saundra, you see that
big stump up on the hill?

801
01:11:05,524 --> 01:11:07,588
I put some weapons right behind it.

802
01:11:07,588 --> 01:11:08,755
You get those.

803
01:11:09,796 --> 01:11:11,282
Okay, you see if you can
get some kerosene lanterns

804
01:11:11,282 --> 01:11:13,108
and bottles and rags.

805
01:11:13,108 --> 01:11:17,275
I got some more weapons
stuck over this way, okay.

806
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:21,624
(insects chirping)

807
01:12:31,745 --> 01:12:32,578
- Psst.

808
01:12:38,978 --> 01:12:40,754
Here, you know how to use this?

809
01:12:40,754 --> 01:12:41,837
- Yeah, yeah.

810
01:12:43,536 --> 01:12:46,066
- That son of a bitch is gonna pay.

811
01:12:46,066 --> 01:12:49,816
- Light that and blow
this place up, come on.

812
01:12:53,347 --> 01:12:55,430
(groans)

813
01:12:57,106 --> 01:13:00,106
(suspenseful music)

814
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:02,918
- Fucking bitch.

815
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:06,237
Takis, Takis, Takis.

816
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:10,906
- What's happening, boss?

817
01:13:10,906 --> 01:13:12,727
- Find them.

818
01:13:12,727 --> 01:13:13,958
(suspenseful music)

819
01:13:13,958 --> 01:13:14,791
- [Men] What's going on?

820
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:15,624
Yeah, fuck.
- I don't know man.

821
01:13:15,624 --> 01:13:17,063
- Fuck's going on?

822
01:13:17,063 --> 01:13:20,063
(suspenseful music)

823
01:13:24,215 --> 01:13:28,382

(explosion)

825
01:13:46,305 --> 01:13:49,985
- What's that, smoke, Jesus Christ.

826
01:13:49,985 --> 01:13:54,385
(gun fires)

(groans)
(blows thudding)

831

- [Man] Oh, God.

832
01:14:31,918 --> 01:14:33,001
Jesus Christ.

833
01:14:34,462 --> 01:14:36,795

How's it feel?

852
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:36,132
- Cindy, stop.

853
01:16:37,504 --> 01:16:39,122
Don't do it.

854
01:16:39,122 --> 01:16:40,622
He's not worth it.

855
01:16:45,154 --> 01:16:46,404
Come on, Cindy.

856
01:16:49,426 --> 01:16:50,865
- You know what?

857
01:16:50,865 --> 01:16:51,865
She's right.

858
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:54,567
You ain't worth shit.

859
01:16:56,133 --> 01:16:57,800
Burn in hell, Billy.

(upbeat music)

861
01:17:36,215 --> 01:17:38,646
♫ I'm naturally bad

♫ Doing wrong just makes me feel right

867
01:17:58,822 --> 01:18:02,950
♫ From the time I was 10,
I held a gun with my right

868
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:07,117
♫ Kept fear at my back and evil in sight

869
01:18:08,599 --> 01:18:13,421
♫ Walked in the shadow, I ran from the law

870
01:18:13,421 --> 01:18:17,588
♫ The fire in my eyes
would even scare my own ma

871
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,479
