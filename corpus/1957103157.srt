1
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:54,480
Okay.

2
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,160
do you

3
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,830
want a drink?

4
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:40,800
No.

5
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:45,690
Nice watch.

6
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,330
Yup.

7
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,310
Going to be a cold.

8
00:07:22,885 --> 00:07:24,815
A few minutes, you're
going to feel so warm.

9
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:25,835
You think he was dead?

10
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:26,495
Who are you?

11
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:33,125
The man on the board.

12
00:07:35,895 --> 00:07:36,434
Who was it?

13
00:07:38,585 --> 00:07:39,905
We're all here for the same purpose.

14
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:40,744
Get some sleep.

15
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:48,094
He looks tired, thinks she looked tired.

16
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:50,255
Why don't you get some shots?

17
00:07:58,895 --> 00:07:59,765
What's your name?

18
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:03,005
My name.

19
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:11,645
Farley dates, um, Morrison
where you're headed deeds.

20
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:12,425
Okay.

21
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:15,365
Well, I'm, I'm headed.

22
00:08:15,365 --> 00:08:19,025
Uh, I'm headed East to Jacksonville.

23
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:20,344
Where do you want to go there for?

24
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:22,414
Well, I'm married.

25
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:23,195
My wife's there.

26
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:25,025
What was your wife?

27
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:26,615
Visiting Jacksonville.

28
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,440
It's a family matter.

29
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,150
What kind of family matters?

30
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,140
My mother is ill.

31
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,570
I would ask you what's wrong
with the lady, but I can see

32
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,970
you not too deeply into it.

33
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,000
Didn't conversation.

34
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,409
You know, if you would answer my
question, maybe I would be more

35
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,180
concerned about answering yours.

36
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,150
Besides weren't you the one
who said to stop talking and

37
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,980
go to sleep and sound advice.

38
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,760
It was too.

39
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:47,990
Alright.

40
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:49,670
Good night.

41
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,850
Good and cold.

42
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,240
It can get mighty cold.

43
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,590
There's a lot of people don't
know just how cold it can get.

44
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,360
Then I can tell you

45
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,610
I was all over Missouri.

46
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,000
Wave.

47
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:28,185
Well, this fellow thinks scalp
on her hospitable fellow things

48
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:31,155
were passing through town.

49
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:37,844
And my first week out, you asked me if
I'd ever spent the night in these parks.

50
00:09:38,385 --> 00:09:39,194
No.

51
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:39,405
Why?

52
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:45,535
I said he suggested that I get a
blanket or two, I will address.

53
00:09:45,855 --> 00:09:45,975
Okay,

54
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:50,015
nice.

55
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:55,145
One day to like this one,
you at Walmart, your DS.

56
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:56,075
Okay.

57
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:09,005
So I'm sitting up on the Mesa inside
of Cherokee territory near Fort lane.

58
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:11,405
No cover at all.

59
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:12,875
No trees, nothing.

60
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:19,640
Knights started to creep in and
the temperature drop fell like

61
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,610
a stone below zero further.

62
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:29,240
So I commenced jumping around like
a beat, let a square dance got

63
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:35,329
scared, real scared what a died too.

64
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:36,800
But.

65
00:10:38,715 --> 00:10:39,314
You got lucky.

66
00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:46,415
This Buffalo came by and I
dropped it with my shops.

67
00:10:47,194 --> 00:10:47,944
Carved them up.

68
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:49,835
Call right inside is gutted hide.

69
00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:50,515
Yes.

70
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:52,955
Very nice and warm.

71
00:10:54,995 --> 00:11:01,385
So if you get cold and you need
a blanket, you let me know.

72
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,610
Am I supposed to believe
that don't believe it.

73
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,180
I don't care.

74
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,000
I have plenty of blankets and I thank you.

75
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:38,855
it's a long way to travel for a woman.

76
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:41,915
You must imagine she's pretty special.

77
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:46,025
Yes, I do got a picture of her.

78
00:12:03,345 --> 00:12:04,335
My mother's ill.

79
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:09,425
I'm going East to meet my wife.

80
00:12:09,425 --> 00:12:10,715
She's visiting my mother.

81
00:12:11,705 --> 00:12:14,015
We didn't know if she'd make it to
Christmas when we usually visit her.

82
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:15,485
So we're visiting her now.

83
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:19,755
Can I have that back please?

84
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,084
Well, that is worth something please.

85
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:38,824
I've been everywhere.

86
00:12:40,354 --> 00:12:43,895
Have you worked inside
the big river, Kentucky?

87
00:12:46,695 --> 00:12:49,475
I ain't never been there approximately.

88
00:12:49,475 --> 00:12:51,545
I live in the desert this past year, but

89
00:12:58,775 --> 00:12:59,645
so you're married.

90
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:00,725
Yes,

91
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:05,195
very much.

92
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:07,985
I don't think I'd like it.

93
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:13,454
What's that supposed to mean,
but it wouldn't like it deeds.

94
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:15,165
I don't take offense at that too.

95
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,694
Well, how can you be so cracked?

96
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:16,995
Sure.

97
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:19,454
Maybe your nights wouldn't
be so cold and lonely.

98
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:22,755
If you had a white Mallard.

99
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:27,375
I see.

100
00:13:29,535 --> 00:13:33,015
You're probably right tonight.

101
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:54,695
I like to think of myself as
a lender and what that means.

102
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:55,935
Yes.

103
00:13:58,935 --> 00:13:59,825
That's what I am.

104
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,040
Oh my my mind.

105
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,189
What a surprise.

106
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,770
Well, I don't doubt that it would be to
you and there's a number of other things.

107
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,400
I'm a city boy.

108
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,550
Like you would not guess
that I am while sunny.

109
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,880
I thought I'd be happy to see
another person after a year

110
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,740
to myself, but I was wrong.

111
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,839
Don't think I'm so stupid.

112
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,310
I didn't see that copying.

113
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:27,500
You got stuck on you bedroom pistol, and
it's a fine one to got stuck on a pillow.

114
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,850
I moved those to a safe place.

115
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,030
If I was, you allowed me to
blow your head on a nut, stop

116
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,110
playing with yourself tonight.

117
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,820
Listen, you talk beyond father.

118
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,460
I did not invite you into this
camp to listen to the spew.

119
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,500
Just who the hell do you think you are?

120
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:48,650
What about the Darren up your
greasy sleeve and the shotgun in

121
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,210
the sharps you have on that city?

122
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,810
Five farm you call the horse,
correct me if I'm wrong, Gramps.

123
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,980
But isn't that a pistol, not
20 inches from your big mouth,

124
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,480
a Remington judging from it.

125
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,410
Sloppy bulge.

126
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,000
If you wish to plant yourself
elsewhere, please go.

127
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,380
But if you are going to squat
there at least keep quiet.

128
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,630
Well, I think you might be
good for around the two yet.

129
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,860
I don't care what you think.

130
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,089
You want to hear a story

131
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,089
city?

132
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:33,479
Boy,

133
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:42,930
what kind of a story?

134
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,900
Something city boy,

135
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,890
I asked to know what kind of story

136
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:12,860
Oh, one that'll make that splatter
your ears and your tongue blades.

137
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,870
Like a metal cache pig.

138
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:21,540
Not that we caught his soda,
your deeds story or not.

139
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,040
Don't get smart.

140
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,690
I won't tell it.

141
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,210
Ah,

142
00:16:41,115 --> 00:16:44,765
A few years ago, and there
was millions of Indians.

143
00:16:44,765 --> 00:16:51,314
See, they covered this land like
buffaloes living there, Indian ways

144
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:57,075
and practicing a strange tribal
rights tribes varied as they will do.

145
00:16:57,075 --> 00:17:01,035
But one hard and fast rule known to
damn near every white man was that

146
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:05,744
you don't go kick it around the
cemeteries because that's sacred ground.

147
00:17:06,629 --> 00:17:07,710
Not so important today.

148
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,550
See, as we killed most of them
off, we're gonna lose all with a

149
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,939
few of their customs since none of
them had never been written down.

150
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:21,089
But one, I can tell you a right
and a white man's encounter with it

151
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,960
and old goat name, uh, Lee Colby.

152
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:33,189
No, he knew better and across the sacred
soil, but he'd lost a half a day already.

153
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,910
And there was nothing
better than to make it up.

154
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,570
Let's see nothing, but

155
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,720
a lot of nonsense I'm ashamed.

156
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,030
I'm ashamed to admit it back there.

157
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,180
I read it, believed all this.

158
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,389
Stupid plain stupid.

159
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,490
It was on his Patrick
Duchess gave up, quit,

160
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,379
lying down and died.

161
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:18,949
Peaceable.

162
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,679
Let myself decompose.

163
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:24,020
You you'll give up.

164
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,230
Look what happens.

165
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,909
Come on, boy.

166
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,409
you're done.

167
00:18:58,875 --> 00:18:59,534
Well, your dad

168
00:19:05,054 --> 00:19:06,044
was that company.

169
00:19:08,985 --> 00:19:11,745
You, you, you achieved or some major.

170
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:15,885
Why didn't you buy one?

171
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:17,385
Get up.

172
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,225
Look at me.

173
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,190
I'm older than you.

174
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,830
And what does he mean when I

175
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,629
talk?

176
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,460
I wish you

177
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,430
great.

178
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,270
Self can choose to drive away.

179
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:20,190
Aye.

180
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:27,470
Hi,

181
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:33,680
how you doing?

182
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:45,185
I think I should temp up then.

183
00:20:47,645 --> 00:20:48,575
I guess you Timbo him.

184
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:49,775
He was just letting me know.

185
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:50,675
Okay.

186
00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:58,865
Ooh, you didn't have to bite
my head off to prove the point.

187
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:10,784
You

188
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:16,185
raised him?

189
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:16,935
Peace.

190
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:25,185
I got to get out.

191
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:12,675
Oh,

192
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:19,725
Hey.

193
00:26:22,185 --> 00:26:22,635
Hey.

194
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,560
Ah,

195
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:00,284
Morrison.

196
00:27:00,345 --> 00:27:02,595
That's almost beautiful.

197
00:27:02,895 --> 00:27:09,195
I mean, it's bizarre, certainly
bizarre, but so much more there.

198
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,544
You didn't make it.

199
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:14,355
I loved it, but I want to know what
you thought of when you told it.

200
00:27:15,405 --> 00:27:19,575
I mean, it seemed to me about so much
more than, uh, the man being punished for

201
00:27:19,575 --> 00:27:21,495
passing through an Indian burial ground.

202
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:22,995
I don't know what you're talking about.

203
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,960
Well, why did you make Lee?

204
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,360
An old man, but he was an old man.

205
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,260
Exactly.

206
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:40,139
So why did she end the story on an image
of children burying the solid man deeds?

207
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:43,320
It's a story you tell it.

208
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,500
And there it is, but it
wasn't that terrifying.

209
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:47,715
Gotcha liked it.

210
00:27:47,775 --> 00:27:52,515
I did, but it seemed more about
dying or an old man's fear of death

211
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:54,705
and about breaking an Indian taboo.

212
00:27:55,665 --> 00:27:58,095
How much did you add the ritual?

213
00:27:59,855 --> 00:28:03,695
It's the body and then
what can be put on that?

214
00:28:05,105 --> 00:28:06,365
And it's what been true or not.

215
00:28:07,025 --> 00:28:10,175
I told him exactly as I remembered it.

216
00:28:10,445 --> 00:28:11,795
Word for word.

217
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,650
Come on Morrison.

218
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,250
I mean, you remember a lot, but there
were so many details to your story.

219
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:23,160
So many, I'm not saying that you're
lying, but I'm suggesting that some

220
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,020
of it might've been prevarication.

221
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,730
Let me put this another way.

222
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,940
Don't you think it's incredible
that Indians would go so far

223
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,230
out of their way to put a man.

224
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,910
So gruesomely to death, simply on a
County, went through a stupid graveyard.

225
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,350
Oh sure.

226
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,670
The dog let it around you.

227
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,580
The minute I saw your
campfire, what did you or not?

228
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,230
What is incredible deans
that you made it this far?

229
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,400
Not knowing two spits and
half a fart about the very

230
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,300
controllable with your friends.

231
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,240
Okay.

232
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,710
I have a lot to learn.

233
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,620
I admitted, but I wish you'd be honest
enough to admit that your story.

234
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,520
Wasn't all true.

235
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,570
Word, horse shit.

236
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,450
Oh, I pick it by that remark.

237
00:29:08,925 --> 00:29:12,945
You don't want to hear another
two, another cup of coffee?

238
00:29:13,245 --> 00:29:13,995
No, I don't.

239
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,815
Well, well, what you got to tell another?

240
00:29:22,965 --> 00:29:23,355
I've got them.

241
00:29:23,355 --> 00:29:23,925
Don't have him

242
00:29:29,715 --> 00:29:30,375
give me another cup.

243
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,270
This story is about a young
fella, not unlike yourself.

244
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,480
The store clerk namer, um,
would be on himself, traveling

245
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,300
alone by the great divide.

246
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:56,070
Those grassy Hills, that
roll on just a ball forever.

247
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,320
He was a modest city worker,
hat and coat, not like yours.

248
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,510
And he was slogging along, but
in the sunset did thoughts.

249
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,660
It was pretty wife.

250
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,580
He was going to see

251
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,210
Whoa.

252
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:56,970
Whoa, Whoa.

253
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,430
Pardon?

254
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,410
Ma'am don't be afraid.

255
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,670
I ain't going to hurt you.

256
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,290
Tom would be, man.

257
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,270
Tom would be

258
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,310
only wondered if you might
be lost or something.

259
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,360
I didn't mean to frighten you

260
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,510
are you alone?

261
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,520
I'll be a pitching camp real soon.

262
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,290
You're more than welcome to join me.

263
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:30,950
If you like

264
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,100
be my pleasure.

265
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:37,820
If you've joined me.

266
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,570
Can I help you get somewhere?

267
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:58,290
No, I'm alone.

268
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,170
do that.

269
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:13,560
I'm fine.

270
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,010
Looking for a place to
camp, not paying attention.

271
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,080
You don't think it's too far.

272
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,310
There's a flat spot.

273
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,090
Just up ahead.

274
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:28,960
Pardon me?

275
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,450
Sorry.

276
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:33,140
I was just saying if it doesn't look too
far, there's a little spot right here.

277
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,160
It looks like a good camper.

278
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:34,790
That'd be fine.

279
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:35,420
Ma'am

280
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,400
I stopped calling you man.

281
00:32:43,304 --> 00:32:43,935
I'm sorry,

282
00:32:47,655 --> 00:32:48,524
Jenny Tuberville.

283
00:32:48,524 --> 00:32:49,514
My name is Jenny.

284
00:33:04,094 --> 00:33:04,725
You warm enough?

285
00:33:07,544 --> 00:33:07,935
I didn't know.

286
00:33:07,935 --> 00:33:08,865
I got this cold at night.

287
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:15,920
no, I couldn't.

288
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,970
No, I couldn't.

289
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:25,580
You're good, man.

290
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,690
Tom, can't imagine how
Frito was out there.

291
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,130
I was so afraid about who is
going to come across me or who

292
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,180
I was going to come across.

293
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,540
I'm very lucky that you found me and
took care of me the way you've done.

294
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,310
I guess you probably figured
while I'm out here by myself.

295
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,290
Thank you, Jenny.

296
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,660
But you don't have to tell
me any, I was thrown out.

297
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,990
I was thrown out of the
town that I lived in.

298
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:00,780
Look.

299
00:34:02,565 --> 00:34:05,835
I'll take you to the nearest town and
I'll see to it that you're taken care

300
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,115
of and that you've got a place to stay.

301
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:12,105
No, I'm gonna tell you
anyone will do the same.

302
00:34:12,105 --> 00:34:13,905
I'm just concerned, like anyone

303
00:34:22,054 --> 00:34:27,514
it's beautiful to have a baby
and anyone who can see beyond

304
00:34:27,514 --> 00:34:29,045
that ritual of marriage.

305
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:33,850
Not

306
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,850
everything's going to be all right.

307
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,670
Try not to think about it.

308
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,405
You're a good man, Tom,
thank you for everything.

309
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,250
I'm sorry.

310
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:04,880
I lied.

311
00:36:08,174 --> 00:36:08,835
I had to lie.

312
00:36:08,845 --> 00:36:10,605
I couldn't tell whether
I could trust you or not.

313
00:36:10,605 --> 00:36:14,295
Whether or not you were a good
man, but you're different, Tom.

314
00:36:14,444 --> 00:36:15,285
You are a good man.

315
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:16,325
Yeah.

316
00:36:17,555 --> 00:36:19,055
You're not pregnant.

317
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:20,735
I felt safer that way.

318
00:36:20,735 --> 00:36:22,745
When people see you're pregnant,
they treat you differently.

319
00:36:23,645 --> 00:36:26,915
I did it because of the men that
came before you put your different,

320
00:36:27,634 --> 00:36:31,355
I don't want to pretend, would
you tell me you're good, man.

321
00:36:32,435 --> 00:36:33,575
You're a decent man.

322
00:36:35,535 --> 00:36:36,855
Please don't do anything to me.

323
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:42,095
You're not going to hurt me.

324
00:36:42,095 --> 00:36:44,735
Tell me, I know you're
not going to hurt me.

325
00:36:45,605 --> 00:36:46,865
You're not like them.

326
00:36:48,785 --> 00:36:53,735
Please stop, please, please.

327
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:54,815
Don't do anything to me.

328
00:38:21,015 --> 00:38:21,885
Journey or fresh.

329
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,710
Pregnant again is before

330
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,910
coffee deeds.

331
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,460
That's terrible.

332
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,430
Sick.

333
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,900
You're disturbed.

334
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:46,890
What was wrong with it?

335
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,840
What it's disgusting.

336
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,920
It's just sick.

337
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,650
Where did you, Treach
up a story like that?

338
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,100
You were listening to it pretty
good here, but I had no idea

339
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,720
what was going to happen next.

340
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,810
Well, it'd be a pretty
solid story if you did.

341
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:00,110
Wouldn't it.

342
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,840
You liked it.

343
00:39:08,775 --> 00:39:12,615
He like just went to my South runt.

344
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:15,645
Admitted you city folks are a strange lot.

345
00:39:16,035 --> 00:39:17,535
You say shocked me.

346
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:19,995
And then when I do you come crying?

347
00:39:20,175 --> 00:39:26,405
Oh, why did well, if you're
such a godsend, no, at all.

348
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,995
Why do you think I liked it?

349
00:39:28,155 --> 00:39:29,465
Same as anybody likes it.

350
00:39:30,215 --> 00:39:31,015
It excites you.

351
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:32,225
It never Rouses yet.

352
00:39:32,595 --> 00:39:33,555
And if it did.

353
00:39:33,555 --> 00:39:35,145
So what that doesn't mean?

354
00:39:35,145 --> 00:39:35,985
I liked it.

355
00:39:36,525 --> 00:39:40,245
I mean, did it ever occur to you
that different people have different

356
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:43,875
tastes and that it might, in
fact it made me feel ill at ease.

357
00:39:44,945 --> 00:39:50,285
Um, the first sign of humanity you
offered me were the story stories.

358
00:39:50,285 --> 00:39:51,005
Why stories?

359
00:39:51,935 --> 00:39:55,745
Well, it's a good way to
get to know a person then.

360
00:39:55,745 --> 00:39:58,745
Yeah, I guess so stories
are entertainment.

361
00:40:00,495 --> 00:40:02,504
Even drive it as something
beads, get to it.

362
00:40:02,714 --> 00:40:03,585
It's not ready yet.

363
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,145
Would you let me finish?

364
00:40:06,725 --> 00:40:12,904
Supposing I were to go to bed right now
as if I had heard no stories at all.

365
00:40:13,774 --> 00:40:21,185
Could I, when you put up a fight,
don't the stories as you call the main

366
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,194
something beyond just entertainment.

367
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:27,765
Yeah, well, no.

368
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,765
Yeah, that means something more
than just entertainment to me.

369
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:32,295
Now that you put it to me in that way,

370
00:40:36,095 --> 00:40:36,485
don't play.

371
00:40:37,025 --> 00:40:40,295
Tell me why the hell should
I just got them game to you?

372
00:40:41,075 --> 00:40:43,565
Not important if it's not important,
my story is not important.

373
00:40:43,805 --> 00:40:46,055
If my story is not important and
why the hell should I tell him?

374
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,490
I know a story.

375
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,680
The reason why I asked you all
those questions was because I know

376
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,980
a much better story than either
one of the stories you told me.

377
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,855
I know a story that will make.

378
00:41:10,395 --> 00:41:13,335
That's fly out through
your ears and your tongue.

379
00:41:13,855 --> 00:41:14,235
Right?

380
00:41:14,235 --> 00:41:14,865
All right.

381
00:41:15,585 --> 00:41:17,085
The North went up and made me deve.

382
00:41:19,535 --> 00:41:21,365
Would you set yourself a muddy task?

383
00:41:21,635 --> 00:41:23,255
Would that handsome meant to sprint?

384
00:41:27,365 --> 00:41:27,665
Okay.

385
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:54,800
as, you know, the war displaced a
good many hardworking families, some

386
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,505
on account of fear of retribution
and some, because, uh, Their homes

387
00:41:59,505 --> 00:42:01,995
were destroyed by the noble North.

388
00:42:03,225 --> 00:42:07,275
Each family had its own reasons,
but many of them, West new land

389
00:42:08,055 --> 00:42:11,955
dealing with the land, they could
rebuild their homes and maybe enjoy

390
00:42:11,985 --> 00:42:13,785
the good life that was once theirs.

391
00:42:14,505 --> 00:42:19,605
Now, these early farmers were willing to
work hard for their trucks because trains

392
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:23,685
were all they had left besides the clothes
on their back and the people they love.

393
00:42:24,765 --> 00:42:27,225
This story is about the
hidden, it's just such a fan.

394
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,600
First day they spent in town shopping
and meeting their new neighbors,

395
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:39,950
getting acquainted with the local
policy, take some towns from the South.

396
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,830
Was it comfort after journey?

397
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,960
Almost like coming home.

398
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,730
Take a good long look.

399
00:43:00,195 --> 00:43:01,425
Ain't nobody gonna say nothing.

400
00:43:05,435 --> 00:43:08,105
You too, but I'm going to get down
and I'm going to put my feet on it.

401
00:43:13,715 --> 00:43:14,465
that's right, honey.

402
00:43:15,185 --> 00:43:15,455
Come here.

403
00:43:16,475 --> 00:43:18,485
You see this post here
from this post here.

404
00:43:18,725 --> 00:43:19,745
Clear onto the next one.

405
00:43:19,745 --> 00:43:20,645
Way over there.

406
00:43:20,855 --> 00:43:25,715
Clear onto the next one, one mile East,
we got one square mile of God's country.

407
00:43:26,714 --> 00:43:27,735
Or is the house

408
00:43:37,634 --> 00:43:38,895
puts much too much.

409
00:43:44,495 --> 00:43:47,165
Louis Docker, Mike Finchley
and Bobby Jeffries.

410
00:43:47,165 --> 00:43:48,575
They all said they'd help us out.

411
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:51,725
And I figure when they
need us, we'll help them.

412
00:43:52,055 --> 00:43:53,345
Other people will help us too.

413
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,455
You're not going to be alone.

414
00:43:55,455 --> 00:43:56,055
Him Marine.

415
00:43:56,055 --> 00:43:58,095
There's going to be a whole
community of people here.

416
00:44:09,305 --> 00:44:10,265
it is beautiful.

417
00:44:12,635 --> 00:44:13,235
So big.

418
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:16,115
And just like the garden of Eden.

419
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,025
I normally put the house.

420
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:25,440
Oh, no.

421
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,610
Dare ask you, Paul.

422
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:27,930
Well, I tell you the truth.

423
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,250
I hadn't thought about that long.

424
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,100
I mean, you ask your mother,
she has all the ideas.

425
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,260
Uh, what about over there?

426
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:33,890
On that Hill?

427
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,200
I thought wouldn't that be nice.

428
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,160
Overlooking everything.

429
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,020
Put it there under those trees.

430
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,610
That would be so pretty in the
morning to look out the window and

431
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:45,290
have trees right outside the window.

432
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:48,970
Just like the rich people do it.

433
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:49,700
Doesn't matter to me.

434
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,090
What's in your head.

435
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,259
I don't know.

436
00:45:07,259 --> 00:45:12,150
I just think that things
are pretty quick right now.

437
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:13,680
It's good.

438
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,890
I've been through the log salt
coffee, and I don't think there's

439
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,060
as much as we guess there'd be.

440
00:45:18,855 --> 00:45:20,265
I don't think there's
half pound of coffee.

441
00:45:20,265 --> 00:45:21,915
And I know there's not two spoons of salt.

442
00:45:22,655 --> 00:45:26,885
You know what I want to do when
I have my own room, my own bed.

443
00:45:26,945 --> 00:45:31,955
I want to paint the walls, sky
blue and over my bed, a breastfed,

444
00:45:31,955 --> 00:45:35,495
maybe I'm getting a picture
of you both right over my bed.

445
00:45:36,725 --> 00:45:40,715
Arthur, how are we going to make
other payments after we make the first

446
00:45:44,165 --> 00:45:44,495
author?

447
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,630
Lean data.

448
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,990
It's not that like it is happening.

449
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,500
I think you better rethink my deal.

450
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,509
One woman, ain't going to call me now.

451
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:00,630
She never told her

452
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,680
you're beautiful.

453
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:09,890
And you are shameless as what
you are and finessed with a dish.

454
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:11,640
I love, man.

455
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,730
What kind of shape will not put
you in in the morning and shit?

456
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,040
I knew it.

457
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,320
I knew it was too good to be true.

458
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,760
Oh no, he was top of your bed.

459
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:36,810
I don't know.

460
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:39,120
I don't have a clock long passed that day.

461
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:42,675
I suspect you're Paul's right,
but I don't want to go to bed now.

462
00:46:43,185 --> 00:46:45,195
It's all first night I
should get to stay up.

463
00:46:45,935 --> 00:46:46,415
What is it?

464
00:46:49,355 --> 00:46:50,075
I don't know.

465
00:47:02,205 --> 00:47:02,715
Papa.

466
00:47:14,525 --> 00:47:15,245
He's in an Arthur.

467
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:19,985
We've got a business problem West of town.

468
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:22,805
Wonder if you could help us with him?

469
00:47:23,315 --> 00:47:24,545
Wait until the morning,

470
00:47:28,415 --> 00:47:28,775
evening.

471
00:47:28,775 --> 00:47:29,015
Ma'am.

472
00:47:30,165 --> 00:47:31,455
Uh, orient Hunter.

473
00:47:31,455 --> 00:47:33,134
You remember our friends from town?

474
00:47:33,495 --> 00:47:37,035
Michael, just give me a minute.

475
00:47:37,665 --> 00:47:45,214
He said it was late till they now,
can you gentlemen do without, just

476
00:47:45,214 --> 00:47:47,044
for tonight, give me a minute.

477
00:47:49,174 --> 00:47:49,984
You have a honey lunch.

478
00:47:49,984 --> 00:47:52,835
You're going to go up in the morning.

479
00:47:52,835 --> 00:47:53,495
I'll give you that book.

480
00:47:53,504 --> 00:47:54,365
I promise you right.

481
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,245
Oh, so you're not going.

482
00:47:58,575 --> 00:47:59,895
I'm just going to be a couple hours now.

483
00:48:00,315 --> 00:48:02,145
I won't let you do this to me again.

484
00:48:03,185 --> 00:48:04,725
Tell you what we'll do our third.

485
00:48:04,734 --> 00:48:06,035
Uh, we'll go on ahead.

486
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:07,984
You'll be able to find it.

487
00:48:13,355 --> 00:48:13,685
All right.

488
00:48:16,634 --> 00:48:17,475
Not all right.

489
00:48:18,735 --> 00:48:19,095
No.

490
00:48:20,525 --> 00:48:23,404
You said that before this happened
again, like it is now that we could

491
00:48:23,404 --> 00:48:25,265
talk it over before you did anything.

492
00:48:25,505 --> 00:48:29,555
There were times I said, if there was
time, how much time do you need it?

493
00:48:29,555 --> 00:48:30,745
Before we can discuss it?

494
00:48:30,755 --> 00:48:33,904
You know, wrong for me.

495
00:48:33,964 --> 00:48:36,035
I said, for me, it ain't wrong.

496
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,200
That's a blind, stupid apartment
liking to say it's for what I said.

497
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:40,620
Hold on log.

498
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,390
You have no idea what's
going on in the world.

499
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:43,650
No, it's wrong.

500
00:51:49,529 --> 00:51:50,040
All right.

501
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:52,529
What have you been,

502
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,430
where are your bed?

503
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,750
You're scaring me or I just take it easy.

504
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:15,870
Did you see, I saw you hitting that, man.

505
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:26,670
No, no, either Huntingdale Eva, a bed,
people in the world are people so bad.

506
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,430
And so he will, the only thing you
can do is you'll have to cover him.

507
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:36,150
I was protecting your Eva, but
there was a woman and a grown up.

508
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,439
He's a grown up to be just as
bad and didn't want to hurt.

509
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:42,870
You want to take all that?

510
00:52:44,279 --> 00:52:45,180
I had good reasons.

511
00:52:46,589 --> 00:52:47,490
That's not marker.

512
00:52:49,529 --> 00:52:50,339
They're not men.

513
00:52:50,669 --> 00:52:51,589
They're not fine.

514
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,649
He, honey, please.

515
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:56,390
You don't understand.

516
00:52:57,229 --> 00:52:58,160
You don't understand.

517
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:05,490
Please.

518
00:53:33,855 --> 00:53:35,295
Oh, wait from her.

519
00:53:41,865 --> 00:53:49,785
You go inside, ours, her go inside.

520
00:53:49,845 --> 00:53:50,865
I'll talk to her.

521
00:54:20,495 --> 00:54:21,605
it's not what you think.

522
00:54:22,685 --> 00:54:24,815
It's not at all what you're
thinking your paws, not like

523
00:54:24,815 --> 00:54:26,165
those other men out there tonight.

524
00:54:26,944 --> 00:54:28,355
He senses that it's wrong.

525
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:33,645
Some folks just hate.

526
00:54:35,465 --> 00:54:37,355
Paul knows it is not that simple

527
00:54:40,865 --> 00:54:44,825
and working on him, working on him.

528
00:54:44,825 --> 00:54:46,085
And I believe he'll stop.

529
00:54:47,225 --> 00:54:48,395
We can get him to stop.

530
00:54:50,525 --> 00:54:51,395
He's a good man.

531
00:54:51,395 --> 00:54:51,845
Really.

532
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:00,485
How can you go to him?

533
00:55:04,265 --> 00:55:06,755
How can you go back tonight?

534
00:55:06,935 --> 00:55:12,305
Ever if my husband, you knew, how am I
supposed to understand anything anymore?

535
00:55:12,365 --> 00:55:13,565
He will stop.

536
00:55:13,805 --> 00:55:15,395
Well, look at what you're saying.

537
00:55:15,995 --> 00:55:18,455
How can you possibly say
anything to defend him?

538
00:55:19,175 --> 00:55:20,495
He chills people.

539
00:55:21,225 --> 00:55:22,935
You act as if it's all going to go away.

540
00:55:22,935 --> 00:55:29,115
Like it's some simple thing, but to tell
you everything I saw tonight, don't,

541
00:55:29,115 --> 00:55:34,205
you know, no, there's a young girl.

542
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:34,655
No.

543
00:55:35,905 --> 00:55:40,235
Does she know about giving everything
you have to your neighbors when you have

544
00:55:40,235 --> 00:55:42,665
nothing because they have less than you.

545
00:55:43,885 --> 00:55:46,625
She know that that man, that killer.

546
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:53,280
Who married me anyway, when most men have
turned, their backstage did walked away.

547
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,650
No conscience, nothing at all.

548
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:00,980
Hi belly full of baby.

549
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:04,730
That's our work.

550
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:08,330
Anyway, I wasn't a woman.

551
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:09,560
I wasn't a wife.

552
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:14,120
I, I wouldn't have kept you.

553
00:56:18,495 --> 00:56:24,515
my daughter and I will
always, you, you all right?

554
00:56:26,975 --> 00:56:31,805
He doesn't do all things, evil things.

555
00:56:33,965 --> 00:56:39,694
Arthur and I love, and you
can ask Pete not to love.

556
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:44,730
If that's what it takes
to get him to stop.

557
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:47,670
I can't do it.

558
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:58,950
I just can't.

559
00:58:09,885 --> 00:58:10,535
It'll clear,

560
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:25,085
I'm going into town to get some supplies.

561
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:26,945
Do you want to come along?

562
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,660
I have so much to do here.

563
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:34,340
Why don't you ask Kiva Eva?

564
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,000
Yeah, mom, on your pod to town.

565
00:59:34,505 --> 00:59:35,285
I love you, Paul.

566
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:53,210
And as they roll off down the road,
it's neighboring field broadened,

567
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:56,810
inviting free arm around her.

568
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,060
I love you Eva.

569
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,759
He says, I love you too.

570
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:05,390
And we're going to make
this a beautiful hall.

571
01:00:22,005 --> 01:00:22,815
So that's it.

572
01:00:27,855 --> 01:00:28,785
You know what this means?

573
01:00:31,605 --> 01:00:32,505
I like it.

574
01:00:34,515 --> 01:00:38,174
Maybe not as scary as mine, but
that's not what your story is about.

575
01:00:38,205 --> 01:00:38,535
Right.

576
01:00:40,214 --> 01:00:43,955
I, uh, my God, I'm pleased.

577
01:00:44,555 --> 01:00:52,595
And me to please, you put me on
the spot harden and to see again,

578
01:00:52,665 --> 01:00:54,174
did you tell him the last story?

579
01:00:54,185 --> 01:00:58,935
It being such a good one,
you know, Oh, come on.

580
01:00:58,935 --> 01:00:59,714
Morrison.

581
01:00:59,714 --> 01:01:01,605
Yours was every bit as good.

582
01:01:01,895 --> 01:01:07,714
Mine was good, but your
is, yours was a ripe one.

583
01:01:08,785 --> 01:01:10,055
Got me thinking about it.

584
01:01:11,015 --> 01:01:12,185
Got me thinking it did.

585
01:01:13,055 --> 01:01:15,875
And I won't have it said that
a store Krug businessman.

586
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:16,714
I didn't me.

587
01:01:16,775 --> 01:01:22,505
I won't have it said, I'm going to
tell you a story that will stick to

588
01:01:22,505 --> 01:01:25,625
you like an eyeball to a cactus needle.

589
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:34,670
And we won't get any sleep and whatever,
would it help if I told you that I'd

590
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:38,840
written a little and you should expect me
to be a good storyteller, I'm telling you

591
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:41,480
I can do better when I have a set mine.

592
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:42,890
Wasn't that good?

593
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:46,280
Here's was more terrifying,
more, more exciting.

594
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:47,840
Sit down.

595
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,850
Morrison is not that important.

596
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:53,930
Shut up thousands stories.

597
01:01:54,555 --> 01:01:56,145
I know 2000 stories.

598
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:59,655
It's a matter of picking the right one
as all, like you told a good story.

599
01:01:59,955 --> 01:02:01,095
I'm going to tell a better one.

600
01:02:01,815 --> 01:02:04,095
There's no large amount of just,
just, don't try to talk me out of it.

601
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:10,715
I'm not telling you it's
going to be a long night.

602
01:02:12,275 --> 01:02:12,995
Yes, he did.

603
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:28,860
I'll split concentrate course work.

604
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:29,650
Yep.

605
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,340
Got a story

606
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:42,690
better than mine.

607
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:43,560
It's better.

608
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:50,780
Tell me not to drink this stuff when
you deeds don't drink it Morrison, but

609
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,280
it helps me to tell stories better.

610
01:02:54,105 --> 01:02:54,675
Don't drink it.

611
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,695
Tell one better than yours.

612
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:01,485
Can't take any chances.

613
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:28,130
Imagine four men, actually
six, two of them are dead.

614
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:47,840
The four alive men looks to straw for
the three of the dead, the patient.

615
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:50,730
The distraught fellow, Dr.

616
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:54,210
Francis Letterman doctor and
the sheriff at the time, bill

617
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:56,790
horn on the circle H ranch.

618
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:57,660
It was rainy.

619
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:58,770
This little get together.

620
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:02,250
It's a contest to pick a
hired gun to be his next top.

621
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:04,790
Man, big go cautious as one.

622
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:10,490
The first two rounds, not many
people attend this too many losers.

623
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:15,980
You got one left, but
he's the paper, his name.

624
01:04:16,665 --> 01:04:21,785
It was Martin laugh and
Martin's mind a killer.

625
01:04:21,935 --> 01:04:26,855
Is that filthier brutish beasts in
bed, no resemblance to himself after

626
01:04:26,855 --> 01:04:30,515
all he feeds well, dresses fine.

627
01:04:31,145 --> 01:04:33,935
He knows how to treat
the ladies in his work.

628
01:04:34,055 --> 01:04:42,605
He is an artist gristle gesture, the arm,
clever thunder, one bullet clean distance.

629
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,990
And that is why he is invincible.

630
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,060
That is how he stays alive.

631
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:54,030
The idea is that he's a
killer, never crossed his mind.

632
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:54,890
Okay.

633
01:05:50,855 --> 01:05:51,185
bill.

634
01:05:51,995 --> 01:05:54,065
You didn't tell me there was
going to be three fights.

635
01:05:54,095 --> 01:05:56,045
What difference does it make Francis?

636
01:05:56,975 --> 01:05:58,475
Oh man, the shoulders to fly.

637
01:05:59,615 --> 01:06:01,025
They didn't choose to die.

638
01:06:01,535 --> 01:06:02,855
I'm supposed to prevent this.

639
01:06:04,654 --> 01:06:05,404
We shouldn't arrest you.

640
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:06,524
Right.

641
01:06:08,384 --> 01:06:13,634
Oh, Francis, we'll be done
here in less than an hour and

642
01:06:13,634 --> 01:06:17,265
I promise you be a on is fine.

643
01:06:18,004 --> 01:06:19,415
You've forgotten a couple of words.

644
01:06:19,415 --> 01:06:23,075
Horn stupid deadly.

645
01:06:34,085 --> 01:06:34,355
Mr.

646
01:06:34,355 --> 01:06:35,015
Horn, Mark.

647
01:06:37,575 --> 01:06:44,055
It is a place it was before and it
remains, he didn't Martin law, the

648
01:06:44,055 --> 01:06:47,805
best gun in the territory those years.

649
01:06:47,805 --> 01:06:50,145
My second batch.

650
01:06:53,655 --> 01:06:53,995
see.

651
01:06:54,785 --> 01:06:58,565
Yeah, you should do
something about your eyes.

652
01:07:00,695 --> 01:07:01,475
Second thought.

653
01:07:02,135 --> 01:07:02,795
Don't worry.

654
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,280
Going to bed early tonight.

655
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,050
Oh, no, I don't think so.

656
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:07,770
I got plans.

657
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:12,560
One bullet six.

658
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:13,820
You'll just have one bullet.

659
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:15,980
All right.

660
01:07:40,905 --> 01:07:41,715
Funny man.

661
01:07:57,170 --> 01:07:59,570
the winner of this match
becomes my next gun.

662
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:03,160
No better paying job exist.

663
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:07,340
To my knowledge, you'll
be a King in your own tie.

664
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:08,900
Oh yeah.

665
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:19,109
Women property power, or if you choose a
little savings to help buy your freedom.

666
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:28,609
And with those other gentlemen,
I'll make sure whoever loses

667
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:31,040
got a good Christian batteries.

668
01:09:04,755 --> 01:09:05,265
Goodbye.

669
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:38,030
you got the job.

670
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:38,930
All right, Martin.

671
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:41,720
You're the best.

672
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:44,930
Miguel put up a good fight.

673
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:47,420
You must've been and
I'll see you very proud.

674
01:10:49,974 --> 01:10:52,365
I'm going to need you by
sign up to sign the contract.

675
01:10:53,144 --> 01:10:54,465
If you want, you can stay with me tonight.

676
01:10:55,245 --> 01:10:58,455
No, no, I got plans.

677
01:11:01,184 --> 01:11:01,905
I'll be there.

678
01:11:42,825 --> 01:11:43,335
Martin.

679
01:12:16,264 --> 01:12:22,844
Bring the clean water and leave it outside
the door by no means am I to be disturbed?

680
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:17,820
Sorry.

681
01:13:28,245 --> 01:13:31,535
Yeah, blood blood on a, on everything.

682
01:13:39,365 --> 01:13:40,445
It's my curse.

683
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:47,585
I can't sleep in this.

684
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:48,304
Uh, get up.

685
01:13:48,394 --> 01:13:49,474
We gotta get this cleaned up.

686
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,160
Why won't it hurt you?

687
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:03,410
This is doing, I don't want
to argue about this, Sarah.

688
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:04,700
I want it cleaned up.

689
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:05,150
All right.

690
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:08,390
Cleaning up.

691
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:08,990
We'll get out.

692
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:09,860
Okay.

693
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:12,260
No, just get out.

694
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:16,880
You get out.

695
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:17,800
I said.

696
01:14:24,135 --> 01:14:24,435
Get out,

697
01:14:29,895 --> 01:14:30,615
get out.

698
01:14:30,985 --> 01:14:33,105
Why don't you just pay me first then?

699
01:14:38,955 --> 01:14:39,555
What did I do?

700
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:12,650
blowy where you been, you're supposed
to run out the horns place this

701
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:14,240
morning to firm up the contract.

702
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:15,710
Blow you up.

703
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:16,010
Sorry.

704
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:16,490
I'm late.

705
01:15:18,105 --> 01:15:18,945
Just give me a minute.

706
01:15:21,855 --> 01:15:22,425
Rough night.

707
01:15:25,515 --> 01:15:26,145
I got ya.

708
01:15:26,295 --> 01:15:27,255
But you better hurry up.

709
01:15:27,255 --> 01:15:28,995
Well, Horn's not used
to being kept waiting.

710
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:46,800
I'll just be another second.

711
01:17:05,219 --> 01:17:08,429
Martin, just a second.

712
01:17:08,429 --> 01:17:08,880
Bluey

713
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:21,509
Martin.

714
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:24,599
I said, yes.

715
01:17:36,105 --> 01:17:36,675
Hey Martin.

716
01:17:56,144 --> 01:17:59,264
This time somebody else
would have to clean up.

717
01:18:04,865 --> 01:18:05,945
I liked of nets.

718
01:18:06,705 --> 01:18:07,625
That was fun.

719
01:18:14,644 --> 01:18:17,855
Oh God, what have I done?

720
01:18:18,964 --> 01:18:22,384
Oh, you did this to me.

721
01:18:22,745 --> 01:18:24,125
Or stick around, man.

722
01:18:24,930 --> 01:18:28,680
Fellow be a fool to go out in the
desert heat without proper rest and

723
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:29,880
sleep the day and head out tonight.

724
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:33,660
Charlie, we'll keep one more day, Charlie.

725
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:34,620
His name is Charlie.

726
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:38,610
No, I just pulled up on that.

727
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:41,870
I got to get moving.

728
01:18:42,170 --> 01:18:45,410
I don't want to make it
to Jacksonville in a week.

729
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:48,020
I got to draw almost
a hundred miles a day.

730
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:48,830
You leave it?

731
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:50,330
Yes, I'm leaving.

732
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:57,960
Once it comes South, we'll go by the
Laramie and stop off at Kansas city.

733
01:18:58,350 --> 01:19:01,740
Well, I will show you two
of the finest sin palaces.

734
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:07,160
This country has to offer great
time going East Morrison, where

735
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,110
you got it all whole damn wig on.

736
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:11,210
It takes four days to get to
wherever it is you're going.

737
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:11,870
What was it?

738
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:12,800
Jacksonville?

739
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:15,140
Yeah, four days.

740
01:19:15,795 --> 01:19:17,145
How do you know you've never been there?

741
01:19:17,985 --> 01:19:20,385
No, but I've been there for, well,
in this great country of ours,

742
01:19:20,385 --> 01:19:24,435
I'll have, you know, while I've
even been back in like a Montana

743
01:19:40,355 --> 01:19:42,605
stop, stop.

744
01:19:44,894 --> 01:19:45,855
Don't make me laugh.

745
01:19:47,644 --> 01:19:48,455
No, just too much.

746
01:19:50,825 --> 01:19:51,424
Where are you going?

747
01:19:51,424 --> 01:19:52,474
More Sandino.

748
01:19:55,264 --> 01:19:55,924
Sure.

749
01:19:56,855 --> 01:19:59,705
I'm here to solve where you off to.

750
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:05,674
Oh, I remember don't look
at me like that a bit fine.

751
01:20:05,674 --> 01:20:08,165
Without you, your city ship, you.

752
01:20:08,165 --> 01:20:10,325
I was thinking of you see.

753
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:13,170
See what marriage does to you?

754
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:16,650
You can't spend a day, not
a single day on yourself.

755
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:18,090
Oh man.

756
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:18,960
What's the rush.

757
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:40,380
Picture I showed you at the beginning
of the evening, I'm going East Morrison.

758
01:20:40,389 --> 01:20:41,639
I have to be there in a week.

759
01:20:42,599 --> 01:20:43,889
I love storytelling.

760
01:20:43,889 --> 01:20:47,940
I love writing, but the only thing that
would stop me from going East is someone

761
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:50,490
I love as much as Elaine and I like you.

762
01:20:51,509 --> 01:20:55,230
I greatly enjoyed your
stories and I'm going East.

763
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:58,830
You're lucky, man.

764
01:20:58,830 --> 01:20:59,190
Deeds.

765
01:21:02,645 --> 01:21:04,535
There are a few fragile moments.

766
01:21:06,185 --> 01:21:06,485
I'll see.

767
01:21:06,485 --> 01:21:08,975
Y'all sure

768
01:21:13,835 --> 01:21:15,695
you ever make it to Seattle.

769
01:21:16,715 --> 01:21:19,115
You're welcome to spend a night
or two, be a warm bed and warmer.

770
01:21:19,505 --> 01:21:20,645
No sleep at all.

771
01:21:20,885 --> 01:21:21,305
True.

772
01:21:21,965 --> 01:21:22,175
Yeah.

773
01:21:22,195 --> 01:21:25,445
Were you still a city boy,
nothing will change that.

774
01:21:26,645 --> 01:21:27,575
Good story.

775
01:21:27,785 --> 01:21:28,595
Won't change that.

776
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:30,510
I know

777
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:37,640
I'm going to be a wealthy man.

778
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:43,880
Spent a year looking with this
bastard slung over my saddle

779
01:21:45,830 --> 01:21:47,150
will be eight days left.

780
01:21:47,930 --> 01:21:49,220
Now I'm not a professional.

781
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:51,380
Then I'm not been hunting.

782
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:58,250
When they first came off the wire Alvin
Dudley, Raymer six counts of murder.

783
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:04,245
And two counts of armed robbery,
$2,000 reward, dead or alive,

784
01:22:07,515 --> 01:22:13,545
five feet 10 on in 50 pounds,
coal, black hair and mustache.

785
01:22:13,575 --> 01:22:17,835
The statements use marks
missing fingers, scarred face,

786
01:22:18,555 --> 01:22:19,755
or he got a honey right away.

787
01:22:19,765 --> 01:22:20,475
The left eye.

788
01:22:23,325 --> 01:22:24,815
You say it was missing fingers.

789
01:22:41,465 --> 01:22:42,395
no, I didn't say that.

790
01:22:44,315 --> 01:22:44,675
Good.

791
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:49,265
Hi, Georgia stories.

792
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:49,895
Come on.

793
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,970
You ain't going to last eight days.
