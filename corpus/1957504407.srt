1
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,588
Calling on my day off.

2
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:30,730
So it's halfway unofficial.

3
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,792
You told me to get in touch with you
if any of the people on your list

4
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:37,078
wound up dead.

5
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,613
And did you by any chance
find bread and wine at the scene?

6
00:12:41,072 --> 00:12:41,940
Yeah.

7
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:47,326
You know I wouldn't be able to tell you
unless you hadn't brought it up first.

8
00:12:47,376 --> 00:12:50,159
Anyway, I'm gonna have to ask you
to fly out to New Jersey

9
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:52,414
Detective, you know I'm not a suspect.

10
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:55,658
I'm not even in your country,
let alone at the crime scene.

11
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,984
Yeah, but you know things
about the killings.

12
00:12:58,034 --> 00:13:00,140
If you conspire to commit murder

13
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,209
you're gonna get the death penalty just like
the person who actually did the killings.

14
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:06,590
But you said there were no injuries,
that she died of natural causes.

15
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,401
Yeah, but forensics might change that story.

16
00:13:09,636 --> 00:13:12,350
The only DNA you're going
to find is from grapevines

17
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,458
that are 2,000 years old.

18
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,947
Just come in for an interview.

19
00:13:17,382 --> 00:13:20,571
I don't think you did it, but you're
the only one that can shed light at this time.

20
00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:23,910
If any  of the information
I've given you gets documented

21
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,348
then I'll be locked up in a mental institution

22
00:13:26,398 --> 00:13:28,694
and I will be able to help no one.

23
00:13:28,744 --> 00:13:31,358
Okay, then just come and give us
the facts that don't sound crazy.

24
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:33,532
I already told you what you needed to know.

25
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:35,318
Go through the list of potential victims

26
00:13:35,368 --> 00:13:38,507
contact the police and authorities
in their various regions

27
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:41,082
and assign people to protect them.

28
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:44,199
You know the only way law enforcement
can devote that kind of  manpower

29
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:46,150
is if you give us more information.

30
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:49,536
I thank you detective
for getting in touch with me.

31
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:52,621
I was a fool to think
the police would do anything.

32
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:56,275
I will have to make contact
with the guardians

33
00:13:56,325 --> 00:13:59,569
and have them sent out if they
have not already been dispatched.

34
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:02,241
- What are you talking about?
- I'm on this call

35
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:06,622
but I am not the only one who has
knowledge of these special events.

36
00:14:06,672 --> 00:14:08,182
Let me pass, brother.

37
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:10,405
I can't believe you
call yourself a protector.

38
00:14:10,455 --> 00:14:12,380
Looks can be deceiving.

39
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:15,101
You're not protecting
anybody today, protector.

40
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:18,225
I know I don't have any power
to stop the zombie.

41
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,092
So we don't have to fight.

42
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:23,900
Oh yes I do,
the Warriors' Code demands it.

43
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,618
You are not a warrior,
you're an assassin.

44
00:14:27,803 --> 00:14:29,132
Same difference.

45
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:45,134
Look I don't care if you're embarrassed
by the way I'm dressed.

46
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:48,403
I could go to church
wearing anything that I want to.

47
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:52,574
Don't think you're better than me
because you wear expensive clothes.

48
00:18:52,624 --> 00:18:53,629
Whatever.

49
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,269
Look, I gotta go,
somebody's knocking on the door.

50
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:03,577
Holy shit!

51
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:07,060
Yes, that is what I seek.

52
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,562
Did you receive Holy Communion today?

53
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:13,082
Yes.. I did.

54
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:18,402
I've been wounded and the only way
to heal is to extract the sacred meal

55
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:20,059
from your bowels.

56
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,569
Are you really Jesus?

57
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:32,733
As your humble servant
I will do whatever you ask.

58
00:19:37,187 --> 00:19:38,854
Take off thy clothes.

59
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:47,075
Turn thyself around.

60
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,961
Yes.

61
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,868
Get thyself down on all fours.

62
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:01,020
Spread up thy buttocks.

63
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,146
Ah, yes.

64
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:07,348
Turned thyself around to face me
but maintain that position.

65
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,840
The Lord giveth and Lord taketh.

66
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,375
I will remember you
when I come into my tingle.

67
00:20:56,816 --> 00:20:59,860
Can you make it not hurt
so much while you're..

68
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:02,800
digging around in my intestines?

69
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:07,428
We all have our crosses to bear.

70
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,064
Are you sure that's gonna be enough?

71
00:21:13,114 --> 00:21:15,214
I only have one wafer.

72
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:21,776
Did you not hear the story of when
I multiplied the loaves of bread?

73
00:21:23,868 --> 00:21:25,108
You just..

74
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,424
make sure you
multiply it outside of my ass.

75
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,097
It is finished.

76
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:48,522
This is my body which
has been shed for you.

77
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:52,507
I shall place this on my wound

78
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:55,873
and restore the flesh
that was ripped from me.

79
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,624
Holy shit!

80
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:24,799
This is a crime scene.

81
00:22:33,343 --> 00:22:34,092
Shit.

82
00:22:35,497 --> 00:22:38,354
I should've known I wasn't
gonna get a signal out here.

83
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:45,125
But I have to tell the police
I found a rape victim!

84
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,203
Okay.

85
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,419
It's alright.

86
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:51,644
You poor woman, I'm so sorry.

87
00:22:51,694 --> 00:22:53,063
But before I go..

88
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:56,661
I have to memorize some of the details

89
00:22:56,711 --> 00:23:00,952
because that way, in case someone else
comes along and contaminates the evidence

90
00:23:01,002 --> 00:23:03,377
I'll have something useful
to tell the police.

91
00:24:55,163 --> 00:24:57,338
Wonder if this is worth something.

92
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:04,216
Bitch!

93
00:25:04,982 --> 00:25:06,971
You crushed my ankle!

94
00:25:07,844 --> 00:25:09,439
Let go!

95
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:11,764
Is this what you want?

96
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:17,165
You want this back?

97
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,550
Tough shit!

98
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,154
I'm gonna sell it and use it
to pay for my medical expenses!

99
00:30:30,923 --> 00:30:31,865
Well?

100
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:33,775
Well what?

101
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:35,858
Aren't you gonna eat me out?

102
00:30:36,365 --> 00:30:38,151
I thought you were gonna blow me first.

103
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:40,599
I just did a fucking strip-tease for you!

104
00:30:40,649 --> 00:30:42,380
Oh okay, well..

105
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:47,557
Go get yourself a garter belt so at least it
looks like you put a little bit of effort into it.

106
00:31:12,965 --> 00:31:13,875
Uh..

107
00:31:14,294 --> 00:31:15,115
Babe!

108
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:17,322
There's a skeleton in the closet.

109
00:31:18,063 --> 00:31:19,569
Are you trying to be funny?

110
00:31:20,358 --> 00:31:22,225
I don't have to try to be funny.

111
00:31:22,275 --> 00:31:23,491
I am funny.

112
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:27,306
I'm gay.

113
00:31:28,562 --> 00:31:30,568
Are you trying to be funny?

114
00:31:31,405 --> 00:31:34,667
"I don't have to try to be funny,
I am funny."

115
00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:42,025
Uh..

116
00:31:42,892 --> 00:31:45,840
Babe, the skeleton came out of the closet.

117
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,939
Well then tell him
to find you some lingerie.

118
00:31:48,989 --> 00:31:51,373
Better yet: tell him to eat you out.

119
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:43,738
I can't believe what I just saw.

120
00:32:43,788 --> 00:32:46,747
Then you shall no longer see
what you disbelieve.

121
00:33:03,674 --> 00:33:07,032
I know you're not going to believe this.
but I'm just here to protect you.

122
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,876
I really am sorry about the gag.

123
00:33:13,794 --> 00:33:16,565
Like I told you,
I'm just here to protect you.

124
00:33:16,903 --> 00:33:20,171
I need you to sit and listen
while I explain things to you.

125
00:33:20,557 --> 00:33:22,200
If you weren't tied up

126
00:33:22,426 --> 00:33:26,429
I'm sure that you would run away from me
when you hear what I have to say.

127
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,782
There are forces

128
00:33:31,644 --> 00:33:33,061
vying for control.

129
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:36,186
When the new age comes in 2012

130
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:37,904
it's not the end of the world.

131
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,336
It's a transition.

132
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,543
And you're of a bloodline
that can win the battle.

133
00:33:45,786 --> 00:33:47,243
But these forces...

134
00:33:48,822 --> 00:33:51,228
these enemies are haunting you.

135
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,039
I can't fight them off.

136
00:33:55,628 --> 00:33:58,188
I know I may not look it,
but I'm just a scholar.

137
00:33:58,238 --> 00:33:59,694
But I can't hide you.

138
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,446
I know

139
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,520
that part of the story
may seem crazy, but..

140
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,276
The part that comes now

141
00:34:09,143 --> 00:34:10,477
is even nuttier.

142
00:34:13,814 --> 00:34:15,009
Are you ready?

143
00:34:18,403 --> 00:34:21,766
The druids have raised someone
from the dead.

144
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:25,396
And he walks the earth

145
00:34:26,436 --> 00:34:29,995
killing everyone of your bloodline.

146
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,442
He can't

147
00:34:34,492 --> 00:34:36,546
be dissuaded from his course.

148
00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:41,408
He was brought to life or

149
00:34:41,843 --> 00:34:43,454
reanim-.. or animated!

150
00:34:45,658 --> 00:34:50,442
Until he destroys every one
of his descendants.

151
00:34:51,441 --> 00:34:54,203
You may have heard of the zombie
when it was a man.

152
00:34:55,312 --> 00:34:59,347
Those who don't know the
story call him Yeshu or..

153
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:01,175
Jesus.

154
00:35:04,157 --> 00:35:06,967
I thought you'd be more shocked,
you seem very calm.

155
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:09,809
Are you really calm?

156
00:35:11,307 --> 00:35:12,209
Really?

157
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:21,194
Thank you.

158
00:35:21,846 --> 00:35:22,539
My pleasure.

159
00:35:23,078 --> 00:35:26,228
You were telling me that
Jesus Christ is a zombie.

160
00:35:26,743 --> 00:35:28,185
Do I have that right?

161
00:35:29,272 --> 00:35:31,741
Zombie is a long dead corpse of a man

162
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:35,286
whom most people associate
with the myth of Jesus.

163
00:35:36,663 --> 00:35:38,401
But the gospels are mostly false.

164
00:35:38,723 --> 00:35:42,990
They were compiled from a bunch of
poorly written and rewritten manuscripts

165
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,398
under the supervision of a Roman emperor.

166
00:35:45,448 --> 00:35:48,224
That's why there's
no anti-Roman sentiment in the stories.

167
00:35:49,198 --> 00:35:53,907
Pontius Pilate was portrayed
as a fair and nice arbitrator.

168
00:35:54,243 --> 00:35:58,373
In real life he was brutal and..
insensitive to the jews.

169
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,420
He would've never catered to the mob.

170
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:01,953
The basis of the story

171
00:36:02,003 --> 00:36:05,440
was that there was a custom
to release a prisoner over passover.

172
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,526
There never was such a custom!

173
00:36:08,258 --> 00:36:09,739
Thanks for the history lesson,

174
00:36:09,789 --> 00:36:13,145
but it really doesn't matter to me
what Jesus was or wasn't.

175
00:36:13,195 --> 00:36:16,358
You're telling me that these days
he's a zombie.

176
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,798
And he's coming after me, right?

177
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:21,424
Uh.. to put it simply, yes.

178
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:24,135
Okay.

179
00:36:24,578 --> 00:36:27,411
Will you let me say something
to test if you're delusional?

180
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:28,443
Surely.

181
00:36:29,192 --> 00:36:31,355
I'm hoping, if you're suffering
from a delusion,

182
00:36:31,405 --> 00:36:34,834
that giving evidence the contrary
will snap you out of it.

183
00:36:34,884 --> 00:36:37,774
Now, if I give you evidence
against your belief

184
00:36:37,824 --> 00:36:40,477
do you promise
to call an ambulance on yourself?

185
00:36:41,686 --> 00:36:43,692
I think I can give you that assurance.

186
00:36:45,164 --> 00:36:46,018
Okay.

187
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:50,977
So if I present an argument, and you find
some really big stretch to make it work

188
00:36:51,027 --> 00:36:55,334
you still have to call an ambulance and let
the EMTs decide what should happen next.

189
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:56,783
Yes.

190
00:37:02,368 --> 00:37:03,158
Okay.

191
00:37:03,279 --> 00:37:06,436
The stories about vampires,
and werewolves, and zombies

192
00:37:06,589 --> 00:37:08,932
are all mathematically impossible.

193
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:12,577
If a zombie bites a human,
who then turns into a zombie.

194
00:37:12,627 --> 00:37:16,153
And that zombie bites another person,
who also turns into a zombie.

195
00:37:16,203 --> 00:37:18,015
And so on and so forth.

196
00:37:18,263 --> 00:37:21,046
Then the number of zombies
would grow exponentially.

197
00:37:21,096 --> 00:37:23,133
And very fast I might add.

198
00:37:23,665 --> 00:37:27,174
And quite soon there would be
no unaffected humans left.

199
00:37:27,674 --> 00:37:29,880
Which would terminate the food source.

200
00:37:30,154 --> 00:37:31,660
And all would perish.

201
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,256
I understand that zombies
are sometimes a symbol for plague.

202
00:37:38,562 --> 00:37:42,025
But all plagues die out eventually,
and humans win.

203
00:37:45,412 --> 00:37:48,478
I think you'll agree
that I've listened patiently.

204
00:37:48,528 --> 00:37:50,816
And I agree with what you say about

205
00:37:51,065 --> 00:37:54,681
creatures contaminating humanity
and mathematical probabilities.

206
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,304
But..

207
00:37:56,715 --> 00:37:58,108
those are stories.

208
00:37:58,704 --> 00:38:01,023
Not real events.

209
00:38:05,608 --> 00:38:08,862
The zombie the haunts you
does not eat human brains.

210
00:38:09,192 --> 00:38:12,131
It does not create other zombies
when it bites people.

211
00:38:12,478 --> 00:38:16,632
It is a partially mummified corpse
that has been animated with magic.

212
00:38:17,276 --> 00:38:22,028
I don't even know if it has consciousness
or any memory of who it was in its past life.

213
00:38:22,951 --> 00:38:25,439
- You read Homer's "The Odyssey"?
- No.

214
00:38:25,592 --> 00:38:26,469
Well..

215
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:30,189
According to Homer, the dead are
in a trance-like existence.

216
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:35,262
Only when they drink sacrificial blood
they can remember their past existence.

217
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,711
Okay.

218
00:38:38,548 --> 00:38:41,011
I can see you're too coherent to be crazy.

219
00:38:42,807 --> 00:38:44,144
I'll go with you.

220
00:38:47,502 --> 00:38:48,692
Are you sure?

221
00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:50,552
Yes.

222
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:53,023
You speak in a logical manner

223
00:38:53,073 --> 00:38:55,380
and you haven't hurt me
even though I'm tied up.

224
00:38:56,081 --> 00:38:58,231
So you won't hurt me when I'm free.

225
00:38:58,448 --> 00:38:59,840
That made me trust you.

226
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:06,286
You are proof that
your bloodline will prevail.

227
00:39:11,505 --> 00:39:14,924
My name is Michael. As I mentioned
earlier, I am a scholar. Well..

228
00:39:14,974 --> 00:39:17,168
- A renegade scholar.
- Renegade?

229
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,699
That may seem like a rebellious word, but..

230
00:39:22,303 --> 00:39:25,579
to put it simply, I am not a member
of any organization.

231
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:28,631
I know about these organizations,
but i'm not a member.

232
00:39:29,428 --> 00:39:31,079
And how can you protect me?

233
00:39:31,474 --> 00:39:33,518
Because knowledge is power.

234
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,442
Magda..

235
00:40:31,898 --> 00:40:32,704
<i>Come on.</i>

236
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,117
Thank you.
Yes, he's feeling much better.

237
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:21,890
Yes, sister Mary, I'll be staying
with my brother for a couple of days

238
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,937
and then I'll be back in the convent.

239
00:41:25,095 --> 00:41:26,712
As also with you.

240
00:41:26,762 --> 00:41:28,268
Okay I'll see you soon.

241
00:41:28,501 --> 00:41:29,210
Bye.

242
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:11,100
Would you die for me the same way
that you think I died for mankind?

243
00:42:11,728 --> 00:42:14,136
Would you let yourself get nailed?

244
00:42:14,418 --> 00:42:18,038
If you are truly my
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ

245
00:42:18,088 --> 00:42:20,070
then I will do so gladly.

246
00:42:20,819 --> 00:42:24,006
I did not die for you or for anyone else.

247
00:42:49,543 --> 00:42:54,335
The Romans stole my story and
changed it to suit their political agenda.

248
00:42:54,899 --> 00:42:57,739
What you believe to be history
is just a stolen myth.

249
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:01,670
Romans stole the Greek pantheon
and renamed the Gods.

250
00:43:02,209 --> 00:43:03,705
Zeus became Jupiter.

251
00:43:03,755 --> 00:43:05,622
Dionysus became Bacchus.

252
00:43:06,611 --> 00:43:10,630
When Romans invented Christianity,
Bacchus became Jesus.

253
00:43:11,228 --> 00:43:12,948
But even the Greeks stole a myth.

254
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:16,681
Crete had different deities
before the mainlanders invaded.

255
00:43:32,737 --> 00:43:35,967
No, there is only one God.

256
00:43:38,448 --> 00:43:40,663
You are a Roman Catholic.

257
00:43:40,713 --> 00:43:43,963
The Roman emperor Constantine
created your religion.

258
00:43:44,013 --> 00:43:48,387
But did you know that Constantine himself
never converted  to Christianity?

259
00:43:48,437 --> 00:43:50,695
He was a worshiper of a Sun God.

260
00:43:51,826 --> 00:43:55,313
I am not the Son of God,
I am the God of the Sun.

261
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,457
You are a bride of Christ.

262
00:44:04,507 --> 00:44:07,840
It's time to consummate the relationship.

263
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,848
But you were celibate.

264
00:44:17,161 --> 00:44:18,159
Was I?

265
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,944
In the gospels I was called "Rabbi".

266
00:44:20,994 --> 00:44:24,139
According to the rabbinical
laws I have been married.

267
00:44:24,372 --> 00:44:26,739
I have two children with Mary Magdalene.

268
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,880
And one child with a woman named Lydia.

269
00:44:29,379 --> 00:44:31,241
You are not Jesus.

270
00:44:31,474 --> 00:44:32,866
You are the beast.

271
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:38,238
And so are you.
We shall make the beast with two backs.

272
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,985
I have no boner but I know
that you are thawing for meat.

273
00:48:11,122 --> 00:48:12,425
It's political.

274
00:48:13,269 --> 00:48:16,691
This side of the talisman
reveals that Yeshu or Jesus

275
00:48:17,037 --> 00:48:20,399
belonged to the political party
that wanted peace with Rome.

276
00:48:21,147 --> 00:48:23,664
Is that why he's called the Prince of Peace?

277
00:48:24,187 --> 00:48:27,161
No, that's the American consumerism
of religion.

278
00:48:27,211 --> 00:48:29,515
No, he was from the Davidic bloodline.

279
00:48:30,253 --> 00:48:31,483
He was a king.

280
00:48:31,837 --> 00:48:33,122
King of the jews.

281
00:48:33,172 --> 00:48:35,640
Well not all jews consider him legitimate.

282
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:39,329
Look, I can't do the whole history
in a conversation.

283
00:48:39,563 --> 00:48:42,108
But if you don't mind,
I do have to think out loud.

284
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:46,291
Sometimes when I hear myself say things,
something important may click.

285
00:48:47,843 --> 00:48:48,647
Sure.

286
00:48:49,387 --> 00:48:53,513
They were a sect of extremists that
lived in a remote settlement called Qumran.

287
00:48:54,036 --> 00:48:57,474
They held a political supper.
What you call "The Last Supper".

288
00:48:58,258 --> 00:49:01,431
They were representatives
of the Zealot war party.

289
00:49:02,413 --> 00:49:05,079
And of the peace party,
which Yeshu was a member.

290
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:06,695
Jesus.

291
00:49:06,933 --> 00:49:08,363
The Prince of Peace.

292
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:10,190
Or the King of Peace.

293
00:49:10,889 --> 00:49:12,578
Yes, if that's easier.

294
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:18,349
They were all to merge into one party
if certain prophecies came to pass.

295
00:49:18,517 --> 00:49:19,965
And when they did not

296
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:21,992
the peace party was discredited.

297
00:49:22,394 --> 00:49:25,245
So he was a king,
just not the King of Peace?

298
00:49:29,331 --> 00:49:30,284
Judas

299
00:49:30,944 --> 00:49:32,536
was at this meal.

300
00:49:33,308 --> 00:49:34,770
Was a wanted man at the time.

301
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:37,959
But there was an even more wanted man
at the so-called "Last Supper".

302
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:38,878
Jesus.

303
00:49:39,232 --> 00:49:41,146
No, it wasn't Jesus.

304
00:49:41,765 --> 00:49:44,064
Judas thought he could bargain
for his own freedom

305
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:46,317
if he turned in the other fugitive.

306
00:49:46,736 --> 00:49:48,371
But the betrayal backfired on him.

307
00:49:48,421 --> 00:49:50,890
Like I told you before,
Pontius Pilate wasn't a fair man.

308
00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:54,067
Is any man who rules really fair?

309
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:58,397
Pilate ordered three leaders
to be crucified.

310
00:49:58,447 --> 00:50:00,265
At Qumran bribes were paid

311
00:50:00,904 --> 00:50:02,247
for a man named Simon.

312
00:50:02,617 --> 00:50:04,039
I won't get into his story.

313
00:50:04,089 --> 00:50:08,529
But he was an old man.
And Jesus was chosen in his place to die.

314
00:50:10,419 --> 00:50:12,595
So he didn't die for mankind.

315
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:14,654
He died for an old man.

316
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:17,517
Just pay attention.

317
00:50:20,303 --> 00:50:23,164
There was no one to offer bribes for Judas,
so he was crucified.

318
00:50:23,214 --> 00:50:25,883
And the crucifixions
weren't a hilltop spectacle.

319
00:50:25,933 --> 00:50:29,725
They were done in an unclean portion
of the settlement to add extra insult.

320
00:50:29,866 --> 00:50:31,541
There weren't many spectators.

321
00:50:31,591 --> 00:50:34,567
And Jesus wasn't crucified in the center,
he was at the end.

322
00:50:35,846 --> 00:50:37,390
Well at least it was private.

323
00:50:39,827 --> 00:50:42,087
You said there weren't many spectators.

324
00:50:44,468 --> 00:50:47,128
After a few hours
enough of a bribe was collected

325
00:50:47,178 --> 00:50:50,914
to have Jesus's execution changed
to being buried alive.

326
00:50:51,236 --> 00:50:52,659
But it was all a ruse

327
00:50:52,836 --> 00:50:54,083
for him to escape.

328
00:50:55,209 --> 00:50:57,208
You got all that from a talisman?

329
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,283
No.

330
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,403
I got that because I've
read the Dead Sea Scrolls.

331
00:51:03,465 --> 00:51:05,707
Talisman does give me new associations.

332
00:51:05,757 --> 00:51:08,460
On this side it talks about
Mary Magdalene.

333
00:51:08,757 --> 00:51:10,004
The whore?

334
00:51:10,655 --> 00:51:12,395
The Romans depicted her as a whore.

335
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:16,281
But she wore the color red for a different
reason, sort of like cardinal status.

336
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,587
She was the head of
a large organization though.

337
00:51:19,957 --> 00:51:24,248
I haven't been able to figure out precisely what
it is, but I'm willing to bet it was religious.

338
00:51:24,635 --> 00:51:25,769
Not Christian.

339
00:51:26,677 --> 00:51:28,177
No, not possible.

340
00:51:28,471 --> 00:51:31,505
There was no such thing as Christianity
when Jesus supposedly lived.

341
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:34,049
Okay whatever,
what does it say about Magdalene?

342
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:35,752
It's baffling.

343
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:39,665
It ties her to the Earth Goddess
that was worshiped in Crete.

344
00:51:39,715 --> 00:51:42,047
The one that predates the Greek pantheon.

345
00:51:42,326 --> 00:51:44,659
But she was Jewish, wasn't she?

346
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,180
- You ever heard of the term "diaspora"?
- No.

347
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,151
Never mind then.

348
00:51:49,201 --> 00:51:52,030
It's not the word that matters,
it's the concept behind it.

349
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,597
The main connection between
Mary's Jewish identity and Crete

350
00:51:55,647 --> 00:51:59,753
is that there were quite a few jews
who lived in Greece.

351
00:52:00,815 --> 00:52:04,054
- Don't you mean quite a lot?
- I don't understand. - Well..

352
00:52:04,104 --> 00:52:07,074
Few is always a small number.
It makes no difference whether I say:

353
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,028
"here are three pennies"
or "here are quite a three pennies".

354
00:52:10,816 --> 00:52:12,979
Right, not all expressions are intelligent.

355
00:52:13,609 --> 00:52:17,847
It would help if you stopped using stupid
expressions when you wanna sound smart.

356
00:52:18,587 --> 00:52:19,576
I will.

357
00:52:20,155 --> 00:52:20,968
Thank you.

358
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,318
As I was about to say,

359
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,980
Crete was a society ruled by women.

360
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:29,224
It was well-structured, fun.

361
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:32,023
And not interested in war.

362
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:34,892
It was a compassionate society.

363
00:52:35,721 --> 00:52:36,670
Eventually..

364
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:38,688
it was invaded.

365
00:52:39,481 --> 00:52:41,902
And the Earth Goddess
was replaced by the Sky Gods.

366
00:52:42,328 --> 00:52:46,309
The female run society
was replaced by a male dominated one.

367
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,725
I don't think I'm gonna be
of any help to you.

368
00:52:49,775 --> 00:52:53,264
If you keep talking about history
I'm probably gonna make some wisecracks.

369
00:52:53,314 --> 00:52:55,220
That's not what you want, right?

370
00:52:55,771 --> 00:52:57,870
Does history bore you so much?

371
00:52:59,222 --> 00:53:03,045
No, but I learned a long time ago
that history isn't true.

372
00:53:03,095 --> 00:53:06,720
Everything that was recorded
had some sort of agenda behind it.

373
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:09,479
There was never any intention
to report the truth.

374
00:53:09,529 --> 00:53:11,085
A professor told me that.

375
00:53:11,407 --> 00:53:14,188
Ever since then I haven't wanted
to learn anymore.

376
00:53:14,238 --> 00:53:18,036
I mean, all you've been telling me is that
the history I've learned isn't true.

377
00:53:18,086 --> 00:53:20,525
What makes the history
that you know any more true?

378
00:53:20,575 --> 00:53:21,870
Let's not argue, Mary.

379
00:53:23,865 --> 00:53:27,231
- Is that okay with you?
- I'll let you know if you need to shut up.

380
00:55:44,324 --> 00:55:45,390
Don't be afraid.

381
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:47,594
I'm not an intruder.

382
00:55:48,189 --> 00:55:49,995
What do you call yourself then?

383
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:52,874
You broke in, you're obviously intruding.

384
00:55:53,172 --> 00:55:55,959
I know this sounds crazy,
you have to come with me.

385
00:55:56,321 --> 00:55:57,889
Actually this..

386
00:55:58,726 --> 00:56:01,975
sounds crazy,
I had a dream that you're coming.

387
00:56:02,876 --> 00:56:04,762
Okay, pack some clothes.

388
00:56:04,812 --> 00:56:06,157
I'll wait here.

389
00:56:37,736 --> 00:56:40,436
I'm sorry, I just got a couple of questions.

390
00:56:42,448 --> 00:56:46,718
In my dream there are
two kinds of people coming after me.

391
00:56:47,479 --> 00:56:49,867
Do you know anything about the other team?

392
00:56:50,315 --> 00:56:53,720
The humans who are coming
are going to try to kill me.

393
00:56:54,314 --> 00:56:56,086
Are they gonna try to kill me too?

394
00:56:57,067 --> 00:56:59,410
No, they'll preserve you

395
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,671
for the thing that's coming
to eat your soul.

396
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:05,382
How are they gonna try to kill you?

397
00:57:05,764 --> 00:57:09,173
They'll first try to defeat me
in hand-to-hand skills.

398
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,404
Why?

399
00:57:10,935 --> 00:57:13,396
They believe in the Warrior's Code.

400
00:57:14,095 --> 00:57:15,675
This is stupid.

401
00:57:16,185 --> 00:57:18,711
They must've never read The Odyssey then.

402
00:57:18,761 --> 00:57:22,760
Greatest warrior, Achilles, renounced
the Warrior Code completely.

403
00:57:23,646 --> 00:57:27,718
Warriors are so quick
to lose their lives to glory.

404
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:31,211
Glory is meaningless in the after life.

405
00:57:31,618 --> 00:57:33,392
Or should they say after death?

406
00:57:33,442 --> 00:57:38,418
No woman would ever be foolish enough
to live by the Warrior's Code.

407
00:57:38,468 --> 00:57:40,334
Life is too precious for us.

408
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:46,364
I just got a couple of questions to ask you
before I decide to go with you.

409
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:01,632
Are you risking your life for me?

410
00:58:02,381 --> 00:58:06,351
Do you think that my life
is more important than yours?

411
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:09,751
Do you think that being selfless
makes you honorable?

412
00:58:11,146 --> 00:58:15,194
Just fulfilling my duty, don't wanna die
if that's what you're asking.

413
00:58:16,463 --> 00:58:18,641
I think all tourists..

414
00:58:18,691 --> 00:58:20,018
are all evil.

415
00:58:20,388 --> 00:58:23,153
They do things for rewards

416
00:58:23,203 --> 00:58:25,777
and pretend to care of the greater good.

417
00:58:26,505 --> 00:58:29,939
Don't you think it's better
to be honest about your intentions?

418
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,788
I really don't have any ulterior motives.

419
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:36,368
If that's the way you wanna play the game.

420
00:58:36,418 --> 00:58:37,504
So be it.

421
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:42,388
Can you see if I dropped my special
necklace by this side of the couch?

422
00:58:42,438 --> 00:58:44,706
- I don't wanna leave without it.
- Yeah.

423
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,280
You fool, I'm one of the assassins.

424
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:57,395
And Jill is dead, you came too late.

425
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:09,763
The zombie came for her.

426
00:59:56,482 --> 00:59:59,456
I waited for you
so I could destroy and kill you

427
00:59:59,506 --> 01:00:02,860
before you attempted
to save anyone else on that list.

428
01:00:03,654 --> 01:00:08,097
Even the most intelligent man
becomes a fool when he gazes upon beauty.

429
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:48,376
Think of the Devil and he shall appear.

430
01:02:48,859 --> 01:02:49,936
Oh my god!

431
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:53,139
Your god? I think not.

432
01:02:53,696 --> 01:02:55,948
I grow weary of your crime.

433
01:02:56,817 --> 01:02:57,873
Forgive me.

434
01:02:57,923 --> 01:03:00,360
Actions speak louder than words.

435
01:03:00,617 --> 01:03:02,370
Gird up thy loins.

436
01:03:04,033 --> 01:03:07,909
What you have made others do, I shall do.

437
01:03:52,838 --> 01:03:55,260
Why do you call this a blowjob?

438
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:57,914
The penis is sucked, not blown.

439
01:03:57,964 --> 01:03:59,913
The miracle I shall perform this day

440
01:03:59,963 --> 01:04:03,633
is that I will blow and inflate
the penis until it bursts.

441
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:06,143
What shall be the name of this?

442
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:08,068
Blowup job?

443
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:12,922
Yes. And my magic will keep you
alive, suffering and dickless.

444
01:04:13,123 --> 01:04:17,790
And you must walk the earth and give
all other rapist priests blowup jobs

445
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:22,219
to make it impossible for them and you
to ever rape another boy.

446
01:04:33,294 --> 01:04:35,971
Do you think that everyone
from my bloodline is dead?

447
01:04:36,888 --> 01:04:38,287
Sure seems that way.

448
01:04:39,188 --> 01:04:41,247
But if there is anyone left alive

449
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:45,301
we owe it to that person
to do for them what I've done for you.

450
01:04:45,682 --> 01:04:48,513
And law enforcement probably
has you on their list.

451
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:51,762
Yeah, I've been thinking about that actually.

452
01:04:52,148 --> 01:04:54,215
They could be waiting for me,
hiding in one of the homes.

453
01:04:54,756 --> 01:04:59,010
You said that they won't protect anyone on
the list until a lot of people end up dead.

454
01:05:00,032 --> 01:05:02,222
We found out a lot of those people are dead.

455
01:05:02,272 --> 01:05:05,021
Surely the police have taken
more protective action by now.

456
01:05:05,071 --> 01:05:07,840
Maybe you don't even need
to protect these people anymore.

457
01:05:09,733 --> 01:05:13,400
You feel selfish if you're the only
person on the list whom I saved?

458
01:05:14,108 --> 01:05:17,945
If you fall into a police trap,
you aren't gonna be protecting anyone.

459
01:05:20,269 --> 01:05:24,029
I don't understand why none of the protectors
from the other various organizations

460
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:26,089
have been able to save anyone.

461
01:05:28,986 --> 01:05:31,270
You ever hear that Jesus is
your personal Saviour?

462
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:34,117
Of course.
Actually, I'm sick of hearing it.

463
01:05:34,728 --> 01:05:38,295
Well, Zombie Jesus is more like
your personal savour.

464
01:05:38,866 --> 01:05:40,161
For some reason

465
01:05:40,729 --> 01:05:43,577
he steals the souls of his victims.

466
01:05:43,947 --> 01:05:46,424
It's the reason I haven't been able
to figure out why. 

467
01:05:48,273 --> 01:05:50,159
Maybe the Gods feed on souls.

468
01:05:50,642 --> 01:05:53,014
The Greek Gods used to feed on the smell

469
01:05:53,384 --> 01:05:54,824
of burning flesh.

470
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:59,119
Maybe the zombie's feeding
on the energy of these souls

471
01:05:59,169 --> 01:06:00,609
to keep itself animated.

472
01:06:02,563 --> 01:06:04,039
It's that gonna hurt?

473
01:06:04,763 --> 01:06:05,696
I mean

474
01:06:06,428 --> 01:06:07,980
when he does it to me.

475
01:06:08,623 --> 01:06:09,834
I don't think so.

476
01:06:09,978 --> 01:06:11,963
I mean, souls aren't physicals.

477
01:06:12,013 --> 01:06:13,475
Pain is physical.

478
01:06:13,525 --> 01:06:17,330
But I promise I'll do everything I can
to keep that from happening.

479
01:06:19,763 --> 01:06:21,162
I would die for you.

480
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:25,860
You would?

481
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:30,619
Why would you do something like that?

482
01:06:32,163 --> 01:06:34,865
Because you are the last of your kind!

483
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:41,712
I know I'm not much of a barrier,
but hopefully this is.

484
01:06:41,762 --> 01:06:43,266
Leave me alone!

485
01:06:43,945 --> 01:06:47,492
I left you once.
The pain has never left me.

486
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:51,204
- So you can be hurt.
- You know who likes that.

487
01:06:51,557 --> 01:06:53,504
Mary, you have remembered me.

488
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:58,271
Yes, I remember how you used
your power on me, at my apartment!

489
01:06:59,285 --> 01:07:01,374
That is unless you're a different zombie.

490
01:07:01,424 --> 01:07:03,016
You all look alike to me.

491
01:07:04,419 --> 01:07:08,366
Deeper in the past
have you ever dreamed of another life?

492
01:07:08,416 --> 01:07:10,580
Of another man in your life?

493
01:07:12,407 --> 01:07:13,372
Stay back.

494
01:07:15,117 --> 01:07:16,887
Do I remind you of someone?

495
01:07:17,096 --> 01:07:19,217
You are someone else.

496
01:07:19,267 --> 01:07:23,229
I can see your soul,
but it sleeps in forgetfulness.

497
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:25,457
I will awaken you, Mary.

498
01:07:28,066 --> 01:07:28,758
Go!

499
01:07:44,498 --> 01:07:46,357
Oh no, not again.

500
01:11:46,336 --> 01:11:48,701
So how do I know that this is really wine?

501
01:11:49,649 --> 01:11:52,904
- What else could it be?
- You know, Christ's blood.

502
01:11:54,498 --> 01:11:56,537
That's actually from the Greek mythology.

503
01:11:56,587 --> 01:11:59,423
In fact the gospels took a lot
from the ancient Greeks.

504
01:11:59,851 --> 01:12:02,543
Plagiarism was pretty common
back then, it ran rampant.

505
01:12:02,593 --> 01:12:04,913
- Shut up!
- That's pretty rude.

506
01:12:05,163 --> 01:12:08,332
You told me to stop you whenever
you talk too much about history.

507
01:12:09,213 --> 01:12:09,911
I see.

508
01:12:09,961 --> 01:12:13,829
Let me tell you one thing
that I'm sure you'll find interesting.

509
01:12:14,991 --> 01:12:18,200
Bread and wine had a different meaning to the Greeks.

510
01:12:18,522 --> 01:12:22,761
Bread was given by the Earth Goddess.
You know, grain given from the earth.

511
01:12:23,054 --> 01:12:25,660
But you said that the Greeks
worship the Sky Gods.

512
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,261
Yes, but when one people's
takes over another

513
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:31,694
the takeover is more successful

514
01:12:31,744 --> 01:12:36,014
if the subjugated people are allowed
to keep some of their beliefs.

515
01:12:36,408 --> 01:12:39,953
I remember reading that when Rome
took over the Christian religion

516
01:12:40,003 --> 01:12:43,220
that they blended some
of the pagan practices into catholicism.

517
01:12:43,779 --> 01:12:44,994
Very good, Mary.

518
01:12:45,742 --> 01:12:47,228
Is that my influence?

519
01:12:47,278 --> 01:12:50,358
Well, you do have a way
of making these things stick.

520
01:12:50,921 --> 01:12:51,854
Thank you.

521
01:12:53,834 --> 01:12:54,670
Wine.

522
01:12:55,354 --> 01:12:57,435
Wine was the Sky Gods' gift.

523
01:12:57,485 --> 01:12:59,986
Dionysus taught humans how to make wine.

524
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:02,086
Bread sustained life.

525
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,395
Wine made it worth living.

526
01:13:07,181 --> 01:13:08,950
I's said that it's the..

527
01:13:10,125 --> 01:13:11,757
only cure for sorrow.

528
01:13:14,531 --> 01:13:16,590
There are other cures for sorrow.

529
01:15:38,599 --> 01:15:41,792
That was my blood that was shed for you.

530
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:47,788
You don't really wanna kill her.

531
01:15:48,287 --> 01:15:50,820
You could've many times,
but you didn't.

532
01:15:52,284 --> 01:15:53,161
Wait.

533
01:15:54,214 --> 01:15:55,264
I remember now.

534
01:15:55,706 --> 01:15:57,652
I never stopped loving you.

535
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:02,377
You drank the sacrificial blood,
you remember your past life.

536
01:16:03,865 --> 01:16:05,176
No, Mary.

537
01:16:06,624 --> 01:16:09,371
Your life is what you make of it,
not what you once were.

538
01:16:09,934 --> 01:16:12,178
I died before you came back to me.

539
01:16:12,807 --> 01:16:16,338
You can have the earthly life
that we should've had.

540
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:17,856
Take my hand.

541
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,545
No, Mary, it's a trick.

542
01:16:19,595 --> 01:16:22,074
You can't go against the spell
that animates him.

543
01:16:22,124 --> 01:16:23,725
I am his true love.

544
01:16:25,309 --> 01:16:28,231
Nonsense.
Dionysus was terrible at relationships.

545
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:31,215
Some men write stories for others to read.

546
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:34,661
And some men believe what others write.

547
01:16:35,136 --> 01:16:38,727
There's gotta be a way to satisfy your
orders and still make everybody happy.

548
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:43,255
- There's got to be a loophole.
- I have thought long on this.

549
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:47,022
If you kill her your own bloodline
will be lost. She's your descendant!

550
01:16:47,072 --> 01:16:51,351
I'm not talking about the Mary you once knew,
I'm talking about the Mary of the present.

551
01:16:51,721 --> 01:16:55,489
If you kill her the Sky Gods will lose.
You're a Sky God!

552
01:16:57,271 --> 01:16:59,483
The druids fooled Rome once.

553
01:16:59,933 --> 01:17:02,853
They let Rome believe
that they were wiped out.

554
01:17:03,006 --> 01:17:04,252
But they hid.

555
01:17:04,707 --> 01:17:06,314
Hid for centuries.

556
01:17:06,364 --> 01:17:07,335
Until now!

557
01:17:07,385 --> 01:17:10,385
They made you into their puppet,
but you could be their master.

558
01:17:10,435 --> 01:17:13,952
In another life
I did indeed achieve high rank

559
01:17:14,002 --> 01:17:15,520
in the druidic sect.

560
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:17,798
Maybe that's the loophole
that will serve us.

561
01:17:18,112 --> 01:17:20,873
Use your ancient rank,
you can command them.

562
01:17:21,026 --> 01:17:23,575
Stay out of the affairs of the Gods.

563
01:17:28,743 --> 01:17:30,341
But you're in love with her.

564
01:17:30,391 --> 01:17:32,784
You forget that I can raise the dead.

565
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:35,020
I will not do the same for you.

566
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:15,482
I have dreamed of life with you.
A life in the flesh.

567
01:18:16,037 --> 01:18:19,612
There is a way for us to be together
but there's a price of pain.

568
01:18:20,127 --> 01:18:21,776
You'll hate me for it.

569
01:18:22,733 --> 01:18:25,624
But great pain's never fully remembered.

570
01:18:25,945 --> 01:18:29,034
As you endure it, I will not seem to pass.

571
01:18:29,669 --> 01:18:33,906
When it is over it will just be
a dull memory. Trust me, I know this.

572
01:18:34,831 --> 01:18:37,513
Foolish mortals bow for the
dominion of the new age.

573
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:43,135
Your ignorant protector
makes me a humiliated God.

574
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:46,469
Degraded into serving men
who want to destroy my bloodline.

575
01:18:47,217 --> 01:18:50,792
Let the bloodline perish.
It matters not to immortals.

576
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:54,213
The Gods are the Gods!

577
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:57,915
And the ages of men
are only of significance to man.

578
01:18:59,925 --> 01:19:03,798
Whoever reigns in the age of Aquarius,
reigns only over man.

579
01:19:03,942 --> 01:19:06,249
But remains the same
in the plane of the Gods.

580
01:19:06,299 --> 01:19:08,632
The only place where status matters.

581
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,405
<i>I loved her.</i>

582
01:21:23,495 --> 01:21:27,091
Tomorrow is the day upon which
so many have hung their hopes.

583
01:21:27,814 --> 01:21:29,846
You have left your body by then.

584
01:21:30,208 --> 01:21:32,733
I did not take your soul. nor will I.

585
01:21:33,705 --> 01:21:36,262
You'll die a death worthy of legend.

586
01:21:36,713 --> 01:21:39,084
And then I shall descend from
the skies as a man

587
01:21:39,134 --> 01:21:41,392
and I will resurrect you as a woman.

588
01:21:41,442 --> 01:21:42,686
The druids will have won.

589
01:21:43,247 --> 01:21:44,984
But it shall not matter to us.

590
01:21:45,354 --> 01:21:48,957
We shall know the happiness
that was taken from us long ago.

591
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:53,264
Dionysus!

592
01:21:53,963 --> 01:21:54,671
No!

593
01:21:55,106 --> 01:21:57,364
Michael, you don't know
what you're doing.

594
01:21:57,414 --> 01:21:58,210
Leave!

595
01:22:00,699 --> 01:22:03,657
Alexander the Great brought
Greek mythology to Jerusalem.

596
01:22:03,779 --> 01:22:04,737
Spare him.

597
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:08,058
He can't save me, I know I have to die.

598
01:22:08,955 --> 01:22:12,445
Followers of Dionysus drank wine
and called it his blood.

599
01:22:13,145 --> 01:22:14,762
He was born of a virgin.

600
01:22:15,244 --> 01:22:16,897
His childhood was in danger.

601
01:22:17,484 --> 01:22:19,567
He raised someone from the dead!

602
01:22:19,961 --> 01:22:23,918
They believed that if they followed him
they would  have salvation.

603
01:22:24,208 --> 01:22:26,056
He died in excruciating death.

604
01:22:26,106 --> 01:22:27,616
Went to the underworld.

605
01:22:27,666 --> 01:22:29,411
He returned as an immortal.

606
01:22:29,645 --> 01:22:34,097
Almost everything written about Jesus
was first written about Dionysus.

607
01:22:34,338 --> 01:22:36,156
Michael. Please shut up.

608
01:22:37,346 --> 01:22:38,275
Dionysus

609
01:22:38,926 --> 01:22:40,799
You had a bride, Ariadne.

610
01:22:40,849 --> 01:22:41,965
She was human.

611
01:22:42,015 --> 01:22:44,699
But Zeus approved of her so much
he made her immortal.

612
01:22:44,749 --> 01:22:45,779
Michael.

613
01:22:46,117 --> 01:22:47,005
Stop.

614
01:22:47,906 --> 01:22:49,579
Go while you still can.

615
01:22:49,991 --> 01:22:51,648
Ariadne & Dionysus.

616
01:22:52,275 --> 01:22:55,501
Are there parallels there
to Mary Magdalene and Jesus?

617
01:22:56,249 --> 01:22:58,436
Mary died before Jesus.

618
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:03,396
Was it natural? Or did Jesus
approve of having her killed?

619
01:23:05,101 --> 01:23:08,095
Dionysus consented
to having Ariadne killed.

620
01:23:08,145 --> 01:23:10,735
Because she took another lover, Theseus.

621
01:23:13,675 --> 01:23:15,499
The day is not yet over.

622
01:23:15,549 --> 01:23:18,396
I know the story of
how Dionysus died as well.

623
01:23:19,421 --> 01:23:20,682
I have the talisman.

624
01:23:20,732 --> 01:23:23,370
You may not be the only immortal
that walks the earth.

625
01:23:23,716 --> 01:23:25,743
I will call the titans.

626
01:23:27,862 --> 01:23:29,847
The titans stole your thunder once.

627
01:23:29,897 --> 01:23:31,741
And they will do it again!

628
01:23:49,276 --> 01:23:50,016
No!

629
01:23:50,394 --> 01:23:51,882
What have you done?

630
01:23:52,115 --> 01:23:53,360
It's his time.

631
01:23:54,864 --> 01:23:56,126
So does mine.

632
01:23:57,598 --> 01:23:58,764
I'm finished.

633
01:24:06,715 --> 01:24:08,850
Farewell, beautiful face.

634
01:24:09,087 --> 01:24:10,312
Without you,

635
01:24:10,362 --> 01:24:13,716
the way to compose sweet music
is forgotten.

636
01:27:57,862 --> 01:28:00,082
The Gods work in mysterious ways.

637
01:28:01,915 --> 01:28:05,621
You're quoting that from Euripides.
That's where I first encountered it.

638
01:28:05,671 --> 01:28:07,533
In his play - "The Bacchae".

639
01:28:07,935 --> 01:28:11,257
You know most Christian expressions
were stolen from Greek plays.

640
01:28:11,530 --> 01:28:15,057
I was referring to the seeming paradox
of my  victory.

641
01:28:15,459 --> 01:28:17,228
The Earth Goddess has won.

642
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:18,845
Women shall rule.

643
01:28:19,364 --> 01:28:22,911
Societies will be compassionate
and war shall be forgotten.

644
01:28:23,482 --> 01:28:27,246
But you're of the bloodline of Jesus
(or Dionysus).

645
01:28:28,167 --> 01:28:30,289
That was what you call a smokescreen.

646
01:28:30,339 --> 01:28:32,727
The zombie did not heed his own words.

647
01:28:32,985 --> 01:28:35,181
Humans meant nothing in the contest.

648
01:28:35,301 --> 01:28:38,320
All that happened was meant for me
to become deified.

649
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,367
- Sparagmos?
- Yes.

650
01:28:40,769 --> 01:28:44,533
An excruciating death was necessary
for me to become immortal.

651
01:28:45,136 --> 01:28:48,122
Yes, but when Dionysus underwent sparagmos

652
01:28:48,172 --> 01:28:50,584
he was already half god and half human.

653
01:28:50,634 --> 01:28:51,812
As was I.

654
01:28:51,989 --> 01:28:55,084
I am the daughter of a Goddess.
My father was human.

655
01:28:55,134 --> 01:28:58,989
Why didn't you do something in the past
when you were Mary Magdalene or Ariadne?

656
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:02,240
You forget that immortals
do not feel time like you do.

657
01:29:02,522 --> 01:29:05,964
All that happened in the past
was in preparation for this day.

658
01:29:08,071 --> 01:29:10,842
Hey, that's why you kept
telling me to shut up.

659
01:29:10,892 --> 01:29:13,368
You were afraid Dionysus
would figure out the plot.

660
01:29:13,418 --> 01:29:16,138
That's right.
It's not easy to fool a God.

661
01:29:21,466 --> 01:29:23,051
Did you know he really loved you?

662
01:29:24,008 --> 01:29:26,188
Yes, I was never false.

663
01:29:27,322 --> 01:29:28,605
But he betrayed me.

664
01:29:28,862 --> 01:29:31,942
Whichever story you hear:
Magdalene or Ariadne

665
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,186
There is betrayal of my love.

666
01:29:35,011 --> 01:29:35,966
But you

667
01:29:36,805 --> 01:29:40,464
You came for me even though
you knew you'd be killed for doing so.

668
