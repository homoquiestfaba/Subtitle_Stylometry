This cold is kicking my ass.

- You were coughing very bad last night.

58
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,863
I went to the deli, got you some soup.

- I wasn't playing hard
to get. You kidding me?

62
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,860
I'll knock out J-Lo and
Beyonce to be with you.

63
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,160

(phone beeping)

71
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,880
- It's my sister, Frances,

72
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,240
probably just calling to
see if I paid her rent.

73
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,330
- You pay her rent?

74
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,210
- Yeah.

75
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,250
She's kinda like the
black sheep of the family.

76
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,840
Didn't go to college, can't
keep a job, you know the story.

77
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,190
- Every family has one.

78
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,800
(Sydney chuckling)

79
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,471
Well, I don't think you helpin' her.

80
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:45,240
- What are you saying, I
shouldn't help my sister?

81
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,980
- Nah, I'm saying, how's
she ever gonna learn

82
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,933
to stand her own two when
she got you as a crutch?

83
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,130
- That's a good point.

84
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,430
I'll think about that
while I'm in the shower.

85
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,917
(soft music)

86
00:07:03,612 --> 00:07:05,578

95
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,000

97
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,183

but they are broke, you know?

99
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,840
- I heard that, girl.

100
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,310
- I thought you say

101
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,530
Where ya call from?

102
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,170
- Home, I'm on my cell phone.

103
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,260
I ain't got that many minutes left

104
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,720
so I have to make this quick.

105
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,690
- So what's up, baby girl?

106
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,290
- I need to borrow $300.

107
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,663
- And if it was $300,
me would have spin you.

108
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:52,626
What ya need it for?

109
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:54,370
- You know that contest they had

110
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,270
to win a jam in Jamaican summer weekend?

111
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,650
- Yeah. Yeah.

112
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,580
Me did call them ras
people out there, trying.

113
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,690

114
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,760
- Three days, two nights
in a four-star hotel

115
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,810
plus free brunch, lunch, and dinner.

116
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:08,680
You're lucky.

117
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,720
- Hot fun in the summertime, girl.

118
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,150
- And a mandem?

119
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,413
- Hold that thought. I got
a call on the other line.

120
00:08:15,714 --> 00:08:16,547
What it do?

121
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:17,660
- Is that any way to answer a phone?

122
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,493
- [Frances] Sydney.

123
00:08:18,493 --> 00:08:21,280
- I just got out of the shower.
I saw I missed your call.

124
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,350
- Look, I need to talk to you,

125
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,080
but I got somebody on the other line.

126
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,470
I'll call you back.

127
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,820
- Well, call them back.

128
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,430
- I was talking to them first.

129
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,850
- Well, which is more important?

130
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,560
Your sister who pays your rent,

131
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,060
or then bummy ass bitches
you be hanging out with?

132
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,000
- I'll call you back.

133
00:08:37,535 --> 00:08:39,040
(phone beeping)

134
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,423
Sorry. That was my
sister, the sex offender.

135
00:08:41,423 --> 00:08:42,970
- What she is?

136
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,080
- Sex offender. Every guy
that fucks her is offended.

137
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,120
- Fuck the family affair.

138
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,090
Now tell me what a go on in your yard,

139
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,660
- Okay, I'm gonna tell you.

140
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,660
So the last night after the concert,

141
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,820
I'm at the hotel bar getting
my late night drink on,

142
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,010
thinking about not bringing

143
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,520
my unemployed ass back to LA and...

144
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,200
- And don't tell me. A
dread lock rasta walks in.

145
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,820
- Dreads down his back.

146
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,040
Skin like black coffee wearing white linen

147
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,220
and a six pack to die for.

148
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,950
- You want me to give you money

149
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,600
to go back a yard to go find
your bombo rassclat man?

150
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,570
- No, I need to borrow some
money to get an abortion.

151
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,420
- Frankie, you never used protection?

152
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,330
- I fucked up, didn't I?

153
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,070
- No more than nobody else, baby girl.

154
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,973
- Can you help me?

155
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,520
- Frankie, you know if me did have it,

156
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,620
you would have get it.

157
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,513
But my money is funny.

158
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:41,930
And you know every penny I
make go into my mother lawyer.

159
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,510
- Thanks any who. I got to go.

160
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,750
I ain't got that many minutes left

161
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,180
and I gotta trace this paper.

162
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,803
- Well, keep the faith on.
Everything soon all right.

163
00:09:49,803 --> 00:09:52,041
All right? So later.

164
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,624
(upbeat music)

165
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,330
- [Sydney] What's up, Jordan?

166
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,150
- Okay. Tell me who he is.

167
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,060
- Who, who is?

168
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,320
- We talk every day, sometimes
two or three times a day.

169
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,730
The only time we don't talk is

170
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,350
when you either break up
with a guy or meet a new guy.

171
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,230
So who's your new love of the minute?

172
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,475
- This is gonna last more than a minute.

173
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:15,043
In fact, I wanna make it permanent.

174
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,819
- That's dangerous for chicks like us.

175
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:20,030
(phone ringing)

176
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,803
- Sydney Michaels. Hello?

177
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,360
Hello?

178
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,530
- Hi.

179
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,700
Sorry to bother you at work,

180
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,840
but I was hoping that you had

181
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,513
a few minutes so that we
could talk sister to sister.

182
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,450
- That's pretty much all
I have, sister to sister.

183
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,410
What is it you want, Frances?

184
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,043
- I need to borrow $300.

185
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,770
- What's it for?

186
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,603
- Does it matter?

187
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:45,653
- You're asking me for
$300. Yes, it matters.

188
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:48,360
- Will you give it to me if I tell you?

189
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,610
- One thing's for sure.
I won't if you don't.

190
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,180
- I'm pregnant and I
need to take care of it.

191
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,050
- By whom?

192
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,630
- Nobody you know.

193
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,811
- Well, if you're not gonna to tell me,

194
00:10:58,811 --> 00:10:59,710
why don't you ask him for the money?

195
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,480
- I can't because I don't know.

196
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,140
- Jesus, you're fucking so many guys,

197
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,561
you don't know who knocked you up?

198
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:05,410
- I know who it is!

199
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,430
I was there. Okay? Give me some credit.

200
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,650
I just don't know his last name

201
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,600
or how to get in touch with him.

202
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,810
It happened while I was on vacation.

203
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:15,070
- You know what? This is a
good life lesson for you.

204
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,195
It'll teach you to be more responsible.

205
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:19,090
- I am responsible!

206
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:23,281
I don't need a life lesson.
What I need is $300.

207
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:25,118
Are you gonna give it to me or not?

208
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:25,951
- Not.

209
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,580
- Thank you.

210
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,503
You've been real helpful.

211
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:31,957
(headset beeping)

212
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,540
(upbeat music)

213
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:50,799
(Lovely humming)

214
00:11:52,273 --> 00:11:54,940
(door knocking)

215
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:03,801
(upbeat music)

216
00:12:03,801 --> 00:12:05,120
- [Lovely] Mr. Corbin.

217
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,970
- I'm terribly sorry for not calling.

218
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,700
I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time.

219
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,533
- No, man.

220
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:14,880
What happened to your phone,
it lock off? I've been calling.

221
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,370
- Yes. I currently relocated my office.

222
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,610
But rest assured, your
case will be handled

223
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,283
with the utmost care.

224
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,060
You wouldn't happen to have
any hot sauce, would you?

225
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,606
- Yeah.

226
00:12:30,606 --> 00:12:33,189
(upbeat music)

227
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,870
- I normally keep a bottle
of hot sauce at my apartment,

228
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,083
but my wife got it in the divorce.

229
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:42,920
(upbeat music)

230
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,963
Immigration law is a very
lucrative occupation.

231
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,940
Keeps me very busy so
I gotta eat when I can.

232
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,810
- Speaking of which,
how my mother case a go?

233
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,810
- Very good. It's moving
like a freight train.

234
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,900
Just zooming down the tracks.

235
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,790
It shouldn't take no more
than another six months.

236
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,623
You two will be together.

237
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:09,890
- Six months?

238
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,280
- Things have slowed
down a bit since 9/11.

239
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,270
Homeland Security tripping.

240
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,480
Acquiring a visa isn't
as easy as it used to be.

241
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,270
- You don't understand.
My mother, she's dying.

242
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,870
I promised her I'd get her here.

243
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,780
- There may be a way we can work this out.

244
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,240
These INS people have been
known to be a little motivated.

245
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,357
- How much?

246
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:38,637
- $5,000 will probably
expedite the process.

247
00:13:38,637 --> 00:13:40,240
- $5,000?

248
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,630
I don't have that type of money there.

249
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,160
Between your attorney fees
and me mother medical bills,

250
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,560
I'm doing the best I
can not to get evicted.

251
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,028
- I wanna do whatever I can to help.

252
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:51,880
(dramatic music)

253
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,610
- You gon' help me?

254
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,650
- No, you're gonna help yourself.

255
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:01,157
But the question is, what
are you willing to do?

256
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:06,279
(dramatic music)

257
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:10,263

285
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,840
- Yo, Tasha.

286
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,180
- Frankie. What's up, baby girl?

287
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:05,620
I thought your phone was cut off.

288
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,573
- It is. I'm on my prepaid cell.

289
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,298
- Thank God for them motherfuckers.

290
00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:12,131
A few years back,

291
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:14,130
a bitch would have been hustling
quarters at the pay phone.

292
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:14,993
- I need a favor.

293
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,123
I need to borrow some money.

294
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,073
Tasha.

295
00:15:23,368 --> 00:15:26,201
(Tasha chuckling)

296
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,346
You hear me?

297
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,440
- [Tasha] Mm-hmm.

298
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,091
- What I say?

299
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:33,242
- Mm-hmm.

300
00:15:33,242 --> 00:15:34,805
- [Frances] Tasha?

301
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:35,638
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:37,864
- Tasha?

303
00:15:37,864 --> 00:15:38,907
- Uh-huh.

304
00:15:38,907 --> 00:15:40,630
- [Frances] Tasha!

305
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,120
- You said you need to borrow some money.

306
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,773
Bitch, I'm high not stupid
so quit yelling at me.

307
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,750
- You gon' lend it to me?

308
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,587
- How much you need?

309
00:15:48,587 --> 00:15:49,563
- [Frances] $300.

310
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,583
Is that a yes?

311
00:15:55,925 --> 00:15:56,940
- Mm-hmm.

312
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,827
- You don't want to know what it's for?

313
00:15:58,827 --> 00:15:59,660
- Mm-hmm.

314
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,653
Come by around three o'clock
and I'll hook a sister up.

315
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:11,625
(upbeat music)

316
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,330
(Corbin moaning)

317
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,293
- I'm loving it.

318
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,483
Very lovely. Very fucking lovely.

319
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,010
We'll make a lot of money.

320
00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:30,482
(Corbin moaning)

321
00:16:30,482 --> 00:16:33,232
(Corbin panting)

322
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:42,853
(upbeat music)

323
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:43,910
- Did you get the file from Channing?

324
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,829
- Yeah, it's on the back seat.

325
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:48,412
(upbeat music)

326
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,670
- Didn't I see this guy on the
news, a rapist or something?

327
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,500
- Pedophile, but he was
never convicted. Forget him.

328
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,650
Did Channing tell you he wanted

329
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,670
to make me his number
one motivational speaker?

330
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,653
- Better you than me. I hate that shit.

331
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:02,490
But if you're good at it,

332
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,977
maybe you can talk some sense
into my stupid ass sister.

333
00:17:04,977 --> 00:17:08,450
- You know, not everyone has
a new piece at home like you.

334
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:12,050
- My new piece has a
name. Leonard Williams.

335
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,200
- Is Mr. Williams gainfully employed?

336
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,190
- He's a mechanic. He fixed the Mercedes.

337
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,490
- That's not all he fixed.

338
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,010
Blue collar. There you go
slumming again, Sydney.

339
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,880
- There you go being judgmental.

340
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,960
Not all men have to have

341
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,870
a six figure income to be appealing.

342
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,280
- Says who?

343
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,040
- It's not about the money.

344
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,000
If a guy can just be nice nowadays,

345
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,900
that's a leap in the right direction.

346
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,840
- [Jordan] You're right. Good
men are few and far between.

347
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,990
- I didn't know lesbians
thought about that type of shit.

348
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,660
- I am not a lesbian. I am bisexual.

349
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,823
And yes, we do think
about things like that.

350
00:17:44,823 --> 00:17:47,100
What do you think, I want
to be an old, bitter dyke?

351
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,360
- You're going in that direction.

352
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,460
- Bullshit! I like dick. Some good dick.

353
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,320
As a matter of fact,

354
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,670
now you're just connected
to a thick bank roll.

355
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,890
- It's more than sex with us.

356
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:58,723
- [Jordan] Bitch, you tell it.

357
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:01,830
- It is. You wouldn't believe
what he did on our first date.

358
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,690
- What, show up late with a
six pack of beer and a video?

359
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,773
- He sang to me.

360
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,503

Okay. So he has the pipes of life.

Bitch ain't got no job.

what it is. It's a gift.

- She'll pay me back when she
gets her income tax check.

434

435
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,970

437
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:28,643
It's a damn paintball
gun. It ain't even loaded.

438
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,163
- Paintball or not, it's
still a fucking gun. Shit.

439
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,650
- What?

440
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,530

441
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,180

442

What you gon' buy, another house?

449
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,977
- Nope. I'm getting out.

450
00:23:16,977 --> 00:23:19,650
- You gonna take that
vacation finally? I hear that.

451
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,750
But you should have enough stash

452
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,420
for what, two or three dozen vacations.

453
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,953
- I mean, out of the game.

454
00:23:25,976 --> 00:23:26,890
- This is a joke, right?

455
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,890
- How do you figure?

456
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,350
- Let me put it into perspective.

457
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,180
You've been playing the
role of motivational speaker

458
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,060
but really putting down
scores for Channing for, what?

459
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,020
- Ever since I failed the bar exam.

460
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,850
Five years. A month in a month out.

461
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,080
- Right.

462
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,720
And beyond the fact that you
don't know how to do shit else,

463
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,160
what makes you think Channing's
even gonna let you out?

464
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,153
- Channing and I are like sisters.

465
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,720
- What does it have to do with
the price of pussy on Sunset?

466
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,980
- I want to have Leonard's children.

467
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,040
I pulled all of my money out of the bank.

468
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,940
Leonard and I are going to
the Cayman Islands tonight.

469
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,240
- There you go. Thinking
with your clit again.

470
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,017
Channing know this?

471
00:24:06,017 --> 00:24:06,850
- I'm gonna tell her when

472
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,660
I deliver the chips and the books.

473
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,490
- Good luck with that.

474
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,540
- Imma be good, girl.

475
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,216
(slow music)

476
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,430
- Good. Very good.

477
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,433
You guys did good.

478
00:24:49,924 --> 00:24:52,591
(drink pouring)

479
00:24:54,845 --> 00:24:56,970
(glass clanking)

480
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:00,290
So you want to talk about it?

481
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,053
- It?
- Yes, it.

482
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,933
You wanna retire.

483
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,800
- How did you know?

484
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,583
- I know the look. I've seen
it in the mirror before.

485
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,753
Why?

486
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,263
- I met someone.

487
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,120
- A man?

488
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,023
- A good man.

489
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,620
Leonard Williams.

490
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,824
- [Channing] The mechanic.

491
00:25:30,824 --> 00:25:32,800
(dramatic music)

492
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,633
- I love him.

493
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,650
- Let's see, my little love bird.

494
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,200
You made 300,000 last year

495
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,650
and whatever you and Jordan
skimmed off each hit.

496
00:25:44,648 --> 00:25:49,217
67,000 in the bank. Another
140,000 in stocks and bonds.

497
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,453
And last week, they
approved your black card.

498
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:57,188
So let me ask you again. Why?

499
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,400
(dramatic music)

500
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,233
I didn't know what I was going

501
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:02,930
to do after I failed the bar exam.

502
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,670
And you brought me in

503
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:07,170
and you made me a part
of something special.

504
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,950
And it's not that I'm ungrateful for that.

505
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,310
It's just that I'm...

506
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,183
- In love.

507
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,133
- Yeah.

508
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,103
- You know,

509
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,853
if you love this man and he loves you,

510
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,513
leave tonight and never come back.

511
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,733
- Thank you.

512
00:26:33,733 --> 00:26:35,713
(dramatic music)

513
00:26:35,713 --> 00:26:36,546
- Go.

514
00:26:36,546 --> 00:26:39,296
(dramatic music)

515
00:26:53,582 --> 00:26:57,288

516
00:26:57,288 --> 00:26:58,121
(slow music)

517
00:26:58,121 --> 00:26:59,530
- Leonard?

518
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,363
- Sydney.

519
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,360
Sydney.

520
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,170
- Hey, you're up.

521
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,003
- Yeah.

522
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,342
Man, that chicken soup you gave me worked.

523
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:13,130
(slow music)

524
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,370
- Can we talk?

525
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,670
- I mean, I was about to go take a shower,

526
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,900
but what's wrong?

527
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,733
Bad day?

528
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,470
- I have something to ask you.

529
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,170
It's the most important
question in my life right now.

530
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:26,974
- Aiit.

531
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:27,824
- Do you love me?

532
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,093
- Come on. That's a silly question.

533
00:27:31,093 --> 00:27:32,430
Of course I love you.
I've told you I love you.

534
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,833
Yes, baby. I love you.

535
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,283
- Do you love me enough to go
to the Cayman Islands tonight?

536
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:41,240
- Wait, I don't understand.
What about your job?

537
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,800
- I quit.

538
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,376
Now will you go with me?

539
00:27:44,376 --> 00:27:45,432
- You quit?

540
00:27:45,432 --> 00:27:46,265
- Yeah.

541
00:27:53,989 --> 00:27:55,170
- You wanna go now?

542
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,120
- I've got two plane tickets

543
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,820
and a car will be here in an hour.

544
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,793
- Sounds like you already made a decision.

545
00:28:02,792 --> 00:28:05,459
Of course I'll go with you. Yes.

546
00:28:07,584 --> 00:28:09,796
(Sydney inhaling sharply)

547
00:28:09,796 --> 00:28:12,546
(dramatic music)

548
00:28:23,891 --> 00:28:27,909
(Leonard breathing heavily)

549
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:29,076
You going now.

550
00:28:30,096 --> 00:28:31,263
- I loved you.

551
00:28:32,102 --> 00:28:32,935
- I know.

552
00:28:34,118 --> 00:28:34,951
I know.

553
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:38,551
(slow music)

554
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,653
- She retired.

555
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,253
- Yup. Got her retirement fund right here.

556
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,110
- Good work.

557
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,720
- I do what I do.

558
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,820
- It's a shame though.

559
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,190
I think I loved her.

560
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,063
- Just not as much as you love money.

561
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,896
(Channing snapping fingers)

562
00:29:44,896 --> 00:29:45,813
- Let's go.

563
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:52,951
(somber music)

564
00:30:57,376 --> 00:30:59,630
(upbeat music)

565
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,730
- See, I'm telling you, girl.

566
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,890
A nigga hit you once,
them go and hit you again.

567
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:07,130
- But he said he didn't even
mean it. It was an accident.

568
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,350
- The first man that accidentally beat him

569
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,770
and see how him like it.

570
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,150
- Hey, y'all remember Jordan.
She worked with Sydney.

571
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,553
- Yeah, I remember seeing
you at the funeral.

572
00:31:16,471 --> 00:31:18,035
- Well, I see you're all moved in

573
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:19,400
and you let your girls here and all.

574
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,627
- Yeah. You know, we doing our thing.

575
00:31:21,627 --> 00:31:24,483
Jordan brought over some
photos to add to the scrapbook.

576
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,290
Can I get you something to drink?

577
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,970
- Yeah. Whatever y'all drinking is cool.

578
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,270
So what's going on?

579
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,370
- Out there fighting lines with switches.

580
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,920
- And talking about
these tired ass niggas.

581
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,390
You can't live with them and
you can't live without 'em.

582
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,710
- You need to learn how
to live without Maurice

583
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,288
if you don't want to end up in a hospital.

584
00:31:47,288 --> 00:31:48,930
- [Tasha] Maurice said he was sorry.

585
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,270
- I'd be sorry too if I
didn't have no place to stay.

586
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,778
I don't know why you let him live

587
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:53,767
with you in the first place.

588
00:31:53,767 --> 00:31:56,300
- But Maurice isn't all bad.

589
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,080
In the beginning, he was real cool.

590
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,710
- Correct. Cool in the beginning.

591
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,010
It's what I'm saying in the
long run you must worry about.

592
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,620
- Besides, ain't no woman gon' get

593
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,380
with no man that starts
off acting a damn fool.

594
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,440
- It has to do with the guy's parents.

595
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,080
If he sees the father beating the mother,

596
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,150
he thinks that's how it's supposed to be.

597
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,383
- Now that's a woman
that knows about a man.

598
00:32:16,383 --> 00:32:17,216
- I don't know.

599
00:32:17,216 --> 00:32:20,090
Them sound like excuses to me.
They know right from wrong.

600
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,770
I don't know what you saw in him.

601
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:25,040
This is a classic case
of domestic violence.

602
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,830
- Maurice was funny.

603
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,670
He knew how to make me laugh.

604
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,790
Told me this crazy joke the other day.

605
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:33,910
What's that useless flesh
around a lesbian's pussy called?

606
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,820
- I give up, what?

607
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,987
- A lesbian (laughs).

608
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,522
- Okay. Well, you know what?

609
00:32:44,522 --> 00:32:46,222
I got to get up early, so Imma go.

610
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,123
- Okay. Thanks for
coming. I'll show you out.

611
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,310
- Now, see, why did you have to say that?

612
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:03,730
I told you what Sydney said
about her getting with girls.

613
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,490
- I forgot.

614
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,490
Y'all should've gave me
the heads up she was gay.

615
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,870
- Like what? Hey, everybody.

616
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,940
This is Jordan, Sydney's
friend, who eats pussy.

617
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,370
You need to learn how to be
politically correct girl.

618
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,750
- One random comment
and now I'm gay bashing.

619
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,140
- See, now I'm gonna call
and apologize for you.

620
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,510
- Well, somebody needs to
teach me about this girl thing.

621
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,273
- Maybe they have classes
about it. Dyke 101.

622
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,046
- I'm not gonna remember that.

623
00:33:29,046 --> 00:33:30,333
Can you write that down for me?

624
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,033
What?

625
00:33:34,675 --> 00:33:36,842
I'll write it down myself.

626
00:33:45,813 --> 00:33:47,583
- I just got this new job.

627
00:33:48,787 --> 00:33:50,410
Imma fuck around and
lose it over this shit.

628
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,953
- [Cuz] What are you talking about?

629
00:33:51,953 --> 00:33:54,780
- Cuz, man, caught a
domestic violence case.

630
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,770
- [Cuz] Trifling ass bitches.

631
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,090
Always trying to keep the black man down.

632
00:33:59,090 --> 00:33:59,923
- Right.

633
00:33:59,923 --> 00:34:01,940
- [Cuz] That's why I
only date white girls.

634
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,320
- Nigga, what? You already know me.

635
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,610
I had to put my pin pan down.

636
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,090
- [Cuz] That's right.

637
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,060
- I hate a bitch can't take a punch.

638
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,580
- [Cuz] You used the smack a bitch method?

639
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,560
- Trick ass bitch wasn't complaining

640
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,340
the other night when I was smacking

641
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,950
that ass while I was running up in her.

642
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,870
- [Cuz] Fuck me. Spank me. Pull my hair.

643
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:21,043
- Right. I love that shit, yo.

644
00:34:21,043 --> 00:34:22,300
- [Cuz] I feel you, dog.

645
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,133
- Man, I'm telling you,

646
00:34:23,133 --> 00:34:24,840
next time I should just kill the bitch.

647
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,390
One side of the story, easy to tell.

648
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,450
You feel me, my nigga?

649
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:28,890
- [Cuz] You should have did her OJ style.

650
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,530
- Hell yeah.

651
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,060
Yo man, she ain't answering anyway.

652
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,523
Imma just raise up out of here.

653
00:34:33,523 --> 00:34:34,934
Imma hit you back later.

654
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:35,767
- [Cuz] Aiit, dog.

655
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:36,600
- Aiit.

656
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,183
- [Cuz] I'll hall at you.
- One.

657
00:34:38,183 --> 00:34:39,548
- [Tasha] How'd you get in here?

658
00:34:39,548 --> 00:34:40,610
- You changed the apartment locks,

659
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,580
but I still got my building key.

660
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,500
- Not anymore you don't.

661
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,630
- Tasha.

662
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:48,870
I came all the way down here
and bought you a present.

663
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,310
Smell that.

664
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,460
That's something that will head bank

665
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,930
a bookie straight to your brain type shit.

666
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:59,107
Let's twist one up and do what
we do. Come on. What you say?

667
00:35:00,105 --> 00:35:01,367
- So you just come down here all blasting

668
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:04,610
and I'm supposed to forget
about how you slapped me around?

669
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:07,400
- Didn't I say I was
sorry? Ain't that enough?

670
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,950
I thought we been through this.

671
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,650
- You beat my ass. No, it's not enough.

672
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,011
And something's really wrong with you

673
00:35:15,011 --> 00:35:16,423
if you think that it should be.

674
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,863
- Aiit, then. Be that way, bitch.

675
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,593
Act pretty if you want to.

676
00:35:23,593 --> 00:35:25,703
You ain't that fucking fine anyway.

677
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,022
I got mad bitches blowing up
my phone trying to get with.

678
00:35:30,022 --> 00:35:32,638
Fuck around with this bitch.

679
00:35:32,638 --> 00:35:33,471
Yo, Lisa.

680
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:34,304
(Lisa speaking in foreign language)

681
00:35:34,304 --> 00:35:36,009
- I've been thinking about you, baby.

682
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,592
(mellow music)

683
00:35:40,642 --> 00:35:43,352
- And no other girl this up?

684
00:35:43,352 --> 00:35:45,118
You can't do it.

685
00:35:45,118 --> 00:35:47,701
- I can never get those dances.

686
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,800
I appreciate you staying over.

687
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,040
Being here is still a little weird for me.

688
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,171
- A little glass of liquor. I'm here.

689
00:35:59,171 --> 00:36:00,004
- For sure.

690
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,150
Look, we all know Tasha a little dingy,

691
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,613
but that shit she told
Jordan was right out there.

692
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:07,560
- And you see how the girl
get stuck up and left?

693
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,510
I don't know how that
was your sister's friend.

694
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,100
You know say, I see her at the funeral,

695
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,340
and she don't even speak.

696
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,510
- It's funny you should mention that.

697
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,070
Because the last time Sydney
and I spoke, we argued.

698
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,370
- About the $300 something?

699
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,203
- Yeah.

700
00:36:21,203 --> 00:36:23,350
- It's probably why it happened.

701
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,550
No, man. A bad joke me a make. I'm sorry.

702
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,600
- Don't apologize.

703
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,660
There's a lot you didn't
know about Sydney.

704
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,010
She had a side to her.

705
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,370
And although she treated me
like shit when she was alive,

706
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,130
she left me everything.

707
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,350
House, the car, money in the bank.

708
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,870
- Okay, so Sydney was a
tough pill to swallow.

709
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:43,180
But you see, everyone
have them good points.

710
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,883
It's just a shame she had
to die to learn about hers.

711
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,593
- Yeah.

712
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,853
- Empty.

713
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,313
- Shit, we out.

714
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,900
Sydney got something up in here.

715
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:02,510
- She must have some
liquor about the place.

716
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,083
- She used to hide it from me.

717
00:37:10,198 --> 00:37:13,781
- And what that, a
portable liquor cabinet?

718
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,186
- Damn, sister.

719
00:37:17,186 --> 00:37:18,820
What the hell were you into?

720
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,220
- Apparently, there's a whole lot

721
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,159
you didn't know about Sydney either.

722
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:24,576
(slow music)

723
00:37:40,988 --> 00:37:42,859
(doorbell ringing)

724
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:45,276
(slow music)

725
00:37:47,957 --> 00:37:50,549
(water splashing)

726
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:52,966
(slow music)

727
00:37:58,022 --> 00:37:58,855
- Can I help you?

728
00:37:58,855 --> 00:37:59,750
- Tasha Ramsey?

729
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,330
- Mm-hmm.

730
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,263
- Now this nigga is trying flowers.

731
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,330
Hold on, I think you're
gonna be taking these back.

732
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,600
- [Jordan] Hey, Tasha.

733
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,663
I thought I'd sent you some flowers

734
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:10,810
so that you could see

735
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:13,610
that all all us lesbians
aren't all useless.

736
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,043
- No, I'm good. Thank you.

737
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:19,581
(slow music)

738
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,210
- You wanna make money, ladies?

739
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,710
You've got to use the
talents that God gave you.

740
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,910
Because we're talking about what?

741
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:38,520
Being bloated, some new carb
diet that isn't working,

742
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,210
guy you met at a club stood you up

743
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,310
when you wanted a meaningful relationship.

744
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,053
Bullshit, right?

745
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,690
Let's talk about something important.

746
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:51,250
Sensuous cosmetics, the
one vocation created

747
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,280
for women by women.

748
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,360
Symbolically personified in the form

749
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,393
of a convertible Cadillac.

750
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,083
And you want that Cadillac,
but you can't have it.

751
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,310
You wanna know why?

752
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,093
Because you're a weak bitch.

753
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,500
I have been giving
motivational speeches for years

754
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,870
and I have never met a sorrier bunch

755
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,570
of bitches than yourselves.

756
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:23,620
You can't sell cosmetics.
You're not a woman.

757
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,150
So take your ass home

758
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:29,100
and serve your husbands'
and boyfriends' dinner.

759
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,500
Pop a chicken pot pie in the oven

760
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,520
or let him pop one in you

761
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,530
because if you can't
sell sensuous cosmetics,

762
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:35,880
that's all you're good for.

763
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:41,470
Do you think that Madonna and Oprah wake

764
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,010
up every morning with your attitude?

765
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,730
No. Get out there.

766
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,140
Every broad that ever smeared

767
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,283
on lipstick is a potential client.

768
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,300
Some chick calls you up and asks you,

769
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,830
does she need makeup?

770
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,000
The question isn't, does she need makeup?

771
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,080
It's an essential accessory.

772
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,100
A woman needs makeup like she needs shoes.

773
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,300
Pretty young thing doesn't ask you

774
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,720
to her trailer park
unless she wants to buy.

775
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,620
She wants to give you her money
to make herself beautiful.

776
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,040
Define her eyes.

777
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,170
Give her cheeks a youthful blush.

778
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,623
Let her bask in the glory of
sexual glow without the sex.

779
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:17,573
Give her the dream.

780
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,810
Because if you can't do that,

781
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,100
you better put on your stilettos

782
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,930
and hit the pavement, princess,
cause you're out of here.

783
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,800
And you'll be sitting around
a section eight apartment

784
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,210
with two fleas sucking your tits

785
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,730
to your knees watching cable talking

786
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:33,753
about I'm every woman,
when you could have been.

787
00:41:01,078 --> 00:41:04,161
(bullets clattering)

788
00:41:13,789 --> 00:41:16,456
(phone ringing)

789
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,120
- This is Jordan.

790
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,040
- Hey, Jordan.

791
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,620
- [Jordan] Hey Frankie.

792
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,080
So how'd the scrapbook go?

793
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,800
- Good. Good.

794
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,400
Again, I am so sorry about
what Tasha said. She's...

795
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,790
- You know what? Don't worry
about it. It's no big deal.

796
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,210
Besides, I sent her flowers.

797
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,620
- You did?

798
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,950
Wow. Good for you.

799
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,150
- Yeah, it is, isn't it?

800
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,930
- I was going through
some of Sydney's papers

801
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,160
and I was kind of curious as
to what kind of work she did.

802
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,010
- Well, as a rule, we're
into sales, but occasionally,

803
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,330
we're asked to give motivational speeches

804
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:49,280
to some of the employees.

805
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,420
You know, stimulate them,
bring their numbers up.

806
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,280
That kind of thing.

807
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,549
- Would you know why she'd have a gun?

808
00:41:54,549 --> 00:41:57,299
(dramatic music)

809
00:41:58,290 --> 00:41:59,273
- Sydney had a gun?

810
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,700
- Sydney had lots of guns.

811
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,250
- Well, she was your sister.

812
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,140
If you don't know, I couldn't tell you.

813
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,280
- I thought maybe he had them

814
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,020
because somebody was trying
to bother her or something.

815
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,080
- Listen, Frankie, I
gotta get some work done.

816
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,793
So if you wanna talk again,
just give me a buzz. Okay?

817
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,170
- Yeah.

818
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,608
Thanks anyway.

819
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:22,568
- Okay.

820
00:42:22,568 --> 00:42:24,140
(headset beeping)

821
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,890
(dramatic music)

822
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:57,539
(phone ringing)

823
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:05,723
- Aha.

824
00:43:05,723 --> 00:43:06,990
- [Jordan] Hey, pretty girl?

825
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:08,963
- Jordan?

826
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,920
- I dreamt about you last night.

827
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,430
- Tell me I was dressed.

828
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,060
- I could, but I'd be lying.

829
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,780
You know the thing with girls like you?

830
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,560
- [Tasha] Straight girls?

831
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,920
- Yeah.

832
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,810
- What's the thing with girls like me?

833
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,380
- You're fed up with men
who treat you like shit,

834
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,710
but you're too intimidated
to try new things.

835
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,500
- [Tasha] What new things?

836
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,333
- Women.

837
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:30,000
- [Tasha] That's not exactly new.

838
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,090
- Well, you and I are.

839
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,690
You like the flowers I sent you?

840
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:40,264
- Yeah. They made me feel good.

841
00:43:40,264 --> 00:43:42,730
- Then we'll be safe to say
that I made you feel good.

842
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:45,270
- I see where you're going with this.

843
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,810
- Then let me go there.

844
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:49,393
I promise you'll feel better
than when you got the flowers.

845
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,250
- Can you just give me some
time to think about this?

846
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,083
- Sure.

847
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,610
I just gave you five seconds.

848
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,653
- This doesn't feel right.

849
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:05,558
Hello?

850
00:44:05,558 --> 00:44:06,391
(headset beeping)

851
00:44:06,391 --> 00:44:08,263
Hello? Hello, are you there?

852
00:44:23,573 --> 00:44:25,990
(slow music)

853
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:39,500
(upbeat music)

854
00:44:42,834 --> 00:44:43,834
- Thank you.

855
00:44:45,663 --> 00:44:48,040
I ain't mad at you, ma.

856
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,977
You sure know how to handle your business.

857
00:44:49,977 --> 00:44:51,740
You know what it is?

858
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,230
- Shade told me you were special.

859
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,033
You put it on me like a champ.

860
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:58,130
You got a real diamond,

861
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,673
hard diesel dick and you
know what to do with it.

862
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:04,350
- Cold metal specialist, baby.

863
00:45:06,018 --> 00:45:08,047
You know how us gangsters do.

864
00:45:08,047 --> 00:45:11,180
(lady laughing)

865
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,607
- You must watch a lot of videos (laughs).

866
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,460
Every nigga that watches
videos want to be a gangster.

867
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,253
- That's cute.

868
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,650
Let me tell you something. Come here.

869
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:28,050
(upbeat music)

870
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,130
Now there's two versions of reality.

871
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:34,492
When people tell it to
your face, and this one.

872
00:45:34,492 --> 00:45:35,325
(lady screaming)

873
00:45:35,325 --> 00:45:37,226
This ain't no video trick.

874
00:45:37,226 --> 00:45:38,476
(lady gasping)

875
00:45:38,476 --> 00:45:41,295
(lady screaming)

876
00:45:41,295 --> 00:45:44,212
(doorbell ringing)

877
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:49,633
- Jordan, you shouldn't
have come over here.

878
00:45:52,636 --> 00:45:54,010
(tense music)

879
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,980
You're assuming a lot or practicing

880
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,371
to be a Victoria's Secret model.

881
00:45:58,371 --> 00:46:00,788
(slow music)

882
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,120
- It's cool if you don't want to.

883
00:46:06,904 --> 00:46:09,571
(Tasha gasping)

884
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:24,233
But you'd be a fool if you don't want to.

885
00:46:25,758 --> 00:46:27,310
(Tasha gasping)

886
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:28,143
- Jordan.

887
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,613
Please.

888
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,233
Fuck me.

898
00:47:18,474 --> 00:47:19,544
- Aha.

899
00:47:19,544 --> 00:47:20,984

901
00:47:21,944 --> 00:47:23,804

907
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:30,090
Yes.

908
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:32,264
- I thought you were straight.

909
00:47:32,264 --> 00:47:33,333
- No more.

910
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:34,725
- No more, huh?

911
00:47:34,725 --> 00:47:35,720
- Uh-uh.

912
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,365
- Say no.

913
00:47:37,365 --> 00:47:38,204
- No.

914
00:47:38,204 --> 00:47:39,189
- No, ma'am.

915
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,364

916
00:47:40,364 --> 00:47:42,440
(Tasha moaning)

917
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,325
- So who do you belong to?

918
00:47:44,325 --> 00:47:45,295
- You.

919
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:46,128
- Who?

920
00:47:46,128 --> 00:47:46,961
- You!

921
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:47,794
- [Jordan] Who?

922
00:47:47,794 --> 00:47:49,100
- You!

923
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,767
(Tasha moaning)

00:47:53,202 --> 00:47:56,350
(slow music)

925
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:57,833
- So how do you feel now?

926
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:01,110
- Better than when I got the flowers.

927
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,010
- Well, just for the record,

928
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:04,540
I'm not some pathetic lesbian stalker.

929
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,409
- I didn't think you were.

930
00:48:06,409 --> 00:48:08,870
- You know the way I
showed up at your door.

931
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:11,853
- Aggressive, but a gift from heaven.

932
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:14,830
- Well, there are several religious groups

933
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,280
that would disagree with you.

934
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,410
So would you still think
I was a gift from heaven

935
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:22,430
if I was a man who showed up
at your door in his underwear?

936
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:24,180
- I would think you were a stalker.

937
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,843
- You smoke a lot?

938
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:33,143
- I could do this for a
living. You want a hit?

939
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:36,917
I actually brought something
else to party with.

940
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:39,334
(slow music)

941
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:44,733
You want a hit?

942
00:48:46,325 --> 00:48:48,742
(slow music)

943
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,133
- Yeah.

944
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:54,860
- You ever done this before?

945
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:00,130
- No, but I've done a
lot of things tonight

946
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,343
I haven't done before.

947
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,283
Why stop now?

948
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:08,663
- You sure?

949
00:49:09,772 --> 00:49:12,189
(slow music)

950
00:49:46,539 --> 00:49:49,289

00:50:35,381 --> 00:50:38,048
(phone ringing)

955
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:40,840
- Yeah?

956
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,673
- Wassup, girl?

957
00:50:41,673 --> 00:50:44,040
- I don't know. Just trying
to figure something out.

958
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,510
- Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you

959
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,150
for hooking me up with Jordan.

960
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,103
- I didn't hook you up with her.

961
00:50:48,103 --> 00:50:50,390
You did that all by yourself.

962
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:53,530
- Whatever. So I'm
seeing her again tonight.

963
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:54,650
- Second date.

964
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:56,010
- The first day, wasn't really a date.

965
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:57,304
It was more like...

966
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,137
- Sex?
- [Tasha] Very good sex.

967
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:00,700
- Is there any other kind?

968
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,840
- With men there is.

969
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,040
- I'm the wrong person
to talk to about that.

970
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,440
- [Tasha] Because Jordan's gay?

971
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,320
- No 'cause she lied to me

972
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,910
when I talked to her about Sydney.

973
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:10,041
- How do you know?

974
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:12,160
- [Frances] I don't know.

975
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,040
- Well, I can respect that.

976
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,140
As long as it's not because

977
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,890
you're a new member of the
church of I hate gay people.

978
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:21,544
- Starting to feel guilty about
my relationship with Sydney.

979
00:51:21,544 --> 00:51:23,640
We were never as close
as sisters should be.

980
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,480
- You should never live
your life with regrets.

981
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,280
- Then how do I deal with the guilt?

982
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:31,003
- Be more like me.

983
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,787
- Get high every day and start
dating women? No, thank you.

984
00:51:35,787 --> 00:51:38,427
Imma have to talk to
somebody else about this.

985
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:39,260
- All right, but when

986
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,760
you're done comparison
shopping for friends,

987
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,110
you can call me back.

988
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:43,460
- Don't worry about your phone.

989
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,850
- You do you and I'll do me.

990
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,790
- No, Jordan will be doing you.

991
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,307

1036
00:56:30,663 --> 00:56:31,530
- Hey, girl.

1037
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:33,650
- Hey, Frankie. What a go on?

1038
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:35,150
- I just had a quick question.

1039
00:56:36,186 --> 00:56:37,317
- On Sydney's calendar, it said that

1040
00:56:37,317 --> 00:56:38,810
you did her hair the day before

1041
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:41,120
she went on a date with this Leonard guy.

1042
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,960
- You know your sister.

1043
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,300
Love call last minute

1044
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,590
and act up if I don't take
her without an appointment.

1045
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:49,010
- Did she ever talk about Leonard?

1046
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:51,570
- No, not really, but she did tell

1047
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:54,007
me some man named Shade know him.

1048
00:56:54,007 --> 00:56:55,020
- Who's Shade?

1049
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,930
- Some tip-looking man used

1050
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:59,010
to get him girl hair done at the shop.

1051
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:00,720
- You got a number one on him?

1052
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:04,233
- Why would I have a pimp's number?

1053
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:09,240
- Can you see if you
can get a number on him?

1054
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,517
- I'll ask around at the shop.

1055
00:57:10,517 --> 00:57:13,210
But me nuh make a promise.

1056
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:14,350
- For sure.

1057
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:16,523
- All right. Love you, girl.

1058
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:28,120
- Hey, sorry I'm late.

1059
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,750
- You could have called.

1060
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,040
- I was at work.

1061
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,120
- They don't have phones where you work?

1062
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,600
- Look, I'm a grown ass woman

1063
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,650
and there's a lot of pressures where I...

1064
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,730
I see you've been busy.

1065
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:43,860
- Not really.

1066
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,930
- They were in the kitchen drawer.

1067
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:46,930
Found them when I was looking

1068
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,593
for the corkscrew for the wine.

1069
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,133
- You do know I wasn't
born yesterday, right?

1070
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:54,973
- Yeah.

1071
00:57:54,973 --> 00:57:57,720
- And although you a virgin
to this lifestyle, I wasn't.

1072
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,250
- Forget it. Let's just eat.

1073
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,083
- No, not yet.

1074
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:04,670
You haven't thanked me for
the flowers I gave you.

1075
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:08,440
- The flowers you gave me three weeks ago?

1076
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,440
- Yeah.

1077
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,273
- I thanked you.

1078
00:58:10,273 --> 00:58:11,106
- No, you didn't.

1079
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:13,410
- What do you want me to do?

1080
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,825
- Crawl.

1081
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,070
(Tasha laughing)

1082
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:18,561
- You're kidding, right?

1083
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:19,530
- No.

1084
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:21,162
- You think I'm just gonna...

1085
00:58:21,162 --> 00:58:21,995
(blows landing)

1086
00:58:21,995 --> 00:58:24,583
- Crawl, bitch! Crawl! Crawl, bitch!

1087
00:58:26,509 --> 00:58:29,176
(phone ringing)

1088
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,050
- Hello?

1089
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,153
- Hey, Frankie.

1090
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:39,893
- Lovely.

1091
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:41,800
What time is it?

1092
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,800
- [Lovely] Late. What ya do, sleep?

1093
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,563
- Yeah, but it's okay.

1094
00:58:46,874 --> 00:58:47,824
Is something wrong?

1095
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:50,203
- No.

1096
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:52,043
Me good.

1097
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:54,637
Look, I was just calling.

1098
00:58:54,637 --> 00:58:56,423
The man, Shade, who you look for,

1099
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:00,825
him live at the motel on Third and Main.

1100
00:59:00,825 --> 00:59:01,658
You know it?

1101
00:59:01,658 --> 00:59:04,033
- Yeah. Yeah. Good looking out.

1102
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,870
You sure you all right?

1103
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:10,570
- Yeah, man.

1104
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:13,263
Don't worry yourself. I'm all right.

1105
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:22,932
(birds chirping)

1106
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:27,127
(slow music)

1107
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:35,440
- Isn't it a little early
in the day to be drinking?

1108
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,404
- Not for what I have to tell you.

1109
00:59:37,404 --> 00:59:39,821
(slow music)

1110
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:50,160
According to Sydney's calendar,

1111
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,260
she was seeing a guy named Leonard.

1112
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,930
I checked her charge card and she

1113
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:55,570
and Leonard was supposed to get on a plane

1114
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:58,543
and fly to the Cayman Islands
the night she was killed.

1115
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:03,750
She saw this guy almost
every day for a month,

1116
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:07,300
but he wasn't at the funeral
and he hasn't called once.

1117
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,803
Zero. Nothing.

1118
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:13,493
- He's cute, for a guy.

1119
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:18,090
Well, what do you think is going on?

1120
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:19,040
- I don't know.

1121
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,660
But I think your
girlfriend knows something

1122
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,600
and I want you to find out what it is.

1123
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,410
- And I think you need to stop
drinking so early in the day.

1124
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:27,200
- Why you gotta bring that up?

1125
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,853
I'm your best friend.

1126
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,113
- And Jordan's my woman.

1127
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:34,520
- Would you take off
those goddamn sunglasses?

1128
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,070
'Cause I can't believe
you're choosing her over me.

1129
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:41,170
- My God. Tasha, did Maurice...

1130
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,300
- I haven't seen Maurice
since I hooked up with Jordan.

1131
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,133
- And where was she when

1132
01:00:45,133 --> 01:00:46,860
you was getting the shit beat out of you?

1133
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,910
(slow music)

1134
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:50,890
Did that bitch put her hands on you?

1135
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:52,450
- Don't call my bitch no bitch.

1136
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:56,340
Jesus, we got in an argument.
I pushed her buttons.

1137
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:59,593
- Don't say it. Do not say
that this was your fault.

1138
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,207
- Don't start with me. Please.

1139
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:07,624
(slow music)

1140
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:14,690
- I'm not fucking with you for
the sake of fucking with you.

1141
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:17,380
I'm telling you this because I care.

1142
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:20,210
- And I think you think
I'm made out of porcelain.

1143
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,210
- Then what are you gonna do about it?

1144
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:23,480
- I love Jordan.

1145
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,410
- If this was a man,

1146
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:26,410
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

1147
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,963
- You don't have to pretend
to be at good friend, Frankie.

1148
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:37,078
You are a good friend. I gotta get back.

1149
01:01:37,078 --> 01:01:39,495
(slow music)

1150
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,520
(dramatic music)

1151
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:55,237
(door knocking)

1152
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:00,806
- Economy going to hell in a hand basket.

1153
01:02:00,806 --> 01:02:01,639
(door knocking)

1154
01:02:01,639 --> 01:02:03,170
Get the goddamn door, yo.

1155
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:04,730
The fuck? You hard of hearing?

1156
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:06,133
- I worked last night.

1157
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:10,963
- Hi, I'm looking for Shade.

1158
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,003
- Some bitch for you.

1159
01:02:14,185 --> 01:02:16,768
(upbeat music)

1160
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,215
- You hear about the thing?

1161
01:02:21,215 --> 01:02:22,048
- You're Shade?

1162
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:24,140
- I'm the one you wanna be under

1163
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,650
when the heat is too much for you, Shade.

1164
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:28,773
- This look good.

1165
01:02:28,773 --> 01:02:30,310
- Ayo, what is you doing?

1166
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:31,260
- What?

1167
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,950
- There's money in the street, yo.

1168
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:35,100
Get to getting, bitch.
Fuck wrong with you?

1169
01:02:37,103 --> 01:02:38,603
Come on now. Fuck.

1170
01:02:40,105 --> 01:02:41,260
Ayo, Sunny, don't fucking play with me.

1171
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:42,960
I will wipe the floor with yo ass.

1172
01:02:44,185 --> 01:02:46,803
Should have put her in a
goddamn corporation here, fuck.

1173
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:58,450
Seen a whole lot of bristles
in my day but you nice.

1174
01:02:58,450 --> 01:02:59,780
You well nice.

1175
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:00,613
- Thank you. But...

1176
01:03:00,613 --> 01:03:02,520
- Ain't no buts, baby.

1177
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,744
Me and you gon' make a
whole lot of money together.

1178
01:03:05,744 --> 01:03:08,080
Imma be your number one man, right?

1179
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:08,913
- I don't...

1180
01:03:08,913 --> 01:03:11,090
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1181
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:12,140
Don't talk like that.

1182
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,132
- I think this was a mistake.

1183
01:03:15,132 --> 01:03:16,643
- Where the fuck you going, bitch?

1184
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:21,340
You don't go nowhere
unless Shade say you do.

1185
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:25,474
- Lovely said...

1186
01:03:25,474 --> 01:03:26,307
- Lovely?

1187
01:03:28,594 --> 01:03:31,344
(Shade laughing)

1188
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,337
- Jody Wallace sent you?

1189
01:03:35,337 --> 01:03:36,170
- Who?

1190
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:37,030
(Shade laughing)

1191
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:38,480
- No, Lovely said...

1192
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,170
What's so funny?

1193
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:43,640
- Girl, you ain't got no
idea what you almost got.

1194
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,023
Wasn't nothing nice.

1195
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:51,830
Boy.

1196
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:52,900
- [Frances] You're crazy.

1197
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:53,943
- What can I say?

1198
01:03:53,943 --> 01:03:56,273
It ain't no shrimp fried
rice and newspapers out here.

1199
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:58,013
Fuck you want?

1200
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,060
- You know Leonard Williams?

1201
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:04,313
- With the Business?

1202
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,650
That's what they call them.

1203
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:08,950
Anybody that fucks up,

1204
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:11,890
he gives him the business
end of a sharp knife.

1205
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:13,010
High-end pro.

1206
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:13,843
- You're friends?

1207
01:04:13,843 --> 01:04:15,910
- Friends? No, he ain't got no friends.

1208
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:18,100
Say, we used to rock back in the day

1209
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:20,580
until he put the business
on one of my girls.

1210
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:21,630
Cut the bitch up so bad,

1211
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:23,500
I couldn't even make a dollar off of her.

1212
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,370
Had to send her ass back to Orange County.

1213
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:27,710
- You know where I can find him?

1214
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:29,503
- Sure you wanna do that?

1215
01:04:31,873 --> 01:04:35,100
That building over there
through Haney and Wilsher.

1216
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,600
- That's where my sister worked.

1217
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,820
- That's what the Business works too.

1218
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:41,986
Non-smoking building, they be
in the back, blazing it up.

1219
01:04:41,986 --> 01:04:43,340
I'm telling you right
now, he a slick talker.

1220
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:45,200
You going after him,
you better be careful,

1221
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,903
or you gon' get the business.

1222
01:04:48,177 --> 01:04:50,338
- You know where he live at?

1223
01:04:50,338 --> 01:04:51,171
- You know what?

1224
01:04:51,171 --> 01:04:52,880
I done said all I'm
about to say, sweetheart.

1225
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,920
Anything else, you got to be wearing

1226
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,070
a whole lot less than
what you already are.

1243
01:06:12,223 --> 01:06:13,650

1244
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:14,750
- Hello?

1245
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,010

- Who is this?

1247
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,500
- [Woman] She's using you.

1248
01:06:21,833 --> 01:06:22,666
- Who is that?

1249
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:23,499
- I don't know.

1250
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:25,620
Are you going somewhere?

1251
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:28,490
- One of the girls at the
office is having a party

1252
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:31,440
so I thought I'd stopped
through and show my face.

1253
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,730
- What else are you gonna show 'em?

1254
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:34,030
- Well, what's that supposed to mean?

1255
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:36,880
- This is the fourth time this
week that you've gone out.

1256
01:06:39,276 --> 01:06:40,353
- You know what? I don't have to go.

1257
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:43,570
It looks like you cooked.

1258
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:45,520
Too bad I'm not hungry.

1259
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,750
- What?

1260
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:47,773
- I'm not hungry.

1261
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:50,303
- Okay.

1262
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:52,923
Don't eat.

1263
01:06:54,182 --> 01:06:57,782
(dishes clanking)

1264
01:06:57,782 --> 01:07:00,180
- You either high or out
of your fucking mind.

1265
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:01,570
Now clean this shit up.

1266
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:03,660
- Fuck you, bitch. Clean it up yourself.

1267
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:05,493
- No, fuck you, bitch.

1268
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,130
You obviously don't know
who you fucking with.

1269
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:10,950
- I don't take this shit from no man

1270
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:13,900
and I'm damn sure not
gonna take it from you.

1271
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,610
- Bitch, when I slap you,
you'll take it and like it.

1272
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:18,543
- I ain't no bitch.

1273
01:07:20,114 --> 01:07:22,614
(tense music)

1274
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:25,283
Fuck you, bitch.

1275
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:29,180
- Fuck off me.

1276
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:30,733
Crazy ass hoe.

1277
01:07:30,733 --> 01:07:33,233
(tense music)

1278
01:07:34,249 --> 01:07:35,082
- Shit.

1279
01:07:36,892 --> 01:07:39,559
(both groaning)

1280
01:07:44,054 --> 01:07:46,554
(tense music)

1281
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:53,600
- Who's my bitch?

1282
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,250
Say it or I swear to God
I'll break your fucking arm.

1283
01:07:57,590 --> 01:07:58,430
- I'm your bitch.

1284
01:07:58,430 --> 01:08:00,345
- [Jordan] What? I didn't hear you.

1285
01:08:00,345 --> 01:08:01,320
- I'm your bitch.

1286
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,417
- And don't you ever fucking forget it.

1287
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:06,000
(Tasha crying)

1288
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:22,302
If it'll make you feel any
better, you never had a chance.

1289
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:24,700
I'm a professional killer. It's what I do.

1290
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:28,100
It's what Sydney did and it's
why her boyfriend killed her.

1291
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:32,683
And if you ever thinking
about leaving me, stop,

1292
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:35,250
because I will find you

1293
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:37,323
and I will break every bone in your body.

1294
01:08:42,787 --> 01:08:45,454
(Tasha sobbing)

1295
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:53,917
(door knocking)

1296
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,257
- There she is.

1297
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,970
How you doing, sweetie?

1298
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:04,913
You look great.

1299
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,240
- You get the something for my mother?

1300
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,293
- Did I get the visa?

1301
01:09:12,567 --> 01:09:15,317
(dramatic music)

1302
01:09:22,813 --> 01:09:25,885
- Lord God. I can't believe it done.

1303
01:09:25,885 --> 01:09:29,110
- Done? Look, there's no
reason to mess up a good thing.

1304
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:32,607
- You gon' talk to me, or did
somebody else walk in here?

1305
01:09:32,607 --> 01:09:33,950
- What is that supposed to mean?

1306
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:36,840
- Means the days of you
pimping me over a long time.

1307
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,673
I'm done.

1308
01:09:38,965 --> 01:09:41,629
(dramatic music)

1309
01:09:41,629 --> 01:09:44,129
- Bitch, you've done when
I say you done (groans).

1310
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:48,490
Come on. You can't tell
me you didn't like it.

1311
01:09:48,490 --> 01:09:50,796
A different dick for
every day of the week.

1312
01:09:50,796 --> 01:09:52,587
(Corbin groaning)

1313
01:09:52,587 --> 01:09:53,670
Motherfucker.

1314
01:09:54,652 --> 01:09:56,642
Stinking bitch.

1315
01:09:56,642 --> 01:09:59,510
(Corbin gasping)

1316
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:00,373
- Mr. Corbin.

1317
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:04,802
Mr. Corbin.

1318
01:10:04,802 --> 01:10:07,552
(dramatic music)

1319
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:10,991
This nigga dead.

1320
01:10:10,991 --> 01:10:13,741
(dramatic music)

1321
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,740
Yes. Hello?

1322
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:33,970
My lawyer, he's having a heart attack.

1323
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:36,300
Yes, please hurry. He needs help.

1324
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:55,065
(slow music)

1325
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:19,398
(phone beeping)

1326
01:11:21,676 --> 01:11:22,620
- [Frances] Hello?

1327
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:23,810
- Hey, girl. It's me.

1328
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:24,733
- [Frances] Tasha?

1329
01:11:24,733 --> 01:11:25,981
- You got time to talk?

1330
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:28,398
(slow music)

1331
01:12:00,710 --> 01:12:03,210
- Damn, Tasha, what happened to your arm?

1332
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:05,877
- Girl, I broke it rollerskating.

1333
01:12:05,877 --> 01:12:06,927
- [Frances] And you didn't call me?

1334
01:12:06,927 --> 01:12:09,280
- Did you suddenly get
a degree in medicine?

1335
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,370
- If you wanted to talk crazy,

1336
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:12,440
we could have did that over the phone.

1337
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,760
- I didn't want Jordan to
know I was talking to you.

1338
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,260
- Why? She might think I'm
trying to get with you?

1339
01:12:20,337 --> 01:12:21,570
- No, I didn't want her to know

1340
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:22,650
that I was going to tell you

1341
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:24,950
that your sister, Sidney,
was a professional killer

1342
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:27,495
and she was murdered by her boyfriend.

1343
01:12:27,495 --> 01:12:29,912
(slow music)

1344
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,233
- Leonard.

1345
01:12:32,233 --> 01:12:34,410
- The guy you showed me
in the picture. Yeah.

1346
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:35,510
- But how do you know?

1347
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:38,810
- I lied to you when I said

1348
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:40,510
that I broke my arm rollerskating.

1349
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:43,863
Jordan broke my arm.

1350
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:46,113
- You need to do something about

1351
01:12:46,113 --> 01:12:48,447
that bitch before she kills you.

1352
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:50,864
(slow music)

1353
01:12:57,604 --> 01:13:02,604
You know, the Lord only helps
those who help themselves.

1354
01:13:02,692 --> 01:13:05,109
(slow music)

1355
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:08,433
- Then pray for me.

1356
01:13:10,084 --> 01:13:12,501
(slow music)

1357
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:18,523
(door banging)

1358
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:38,411
(car engine roaring)

1359
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:45,073
(door banging)

1360
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:54,053
- Whoa. What's going on here?

1361
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,790
- You killed my sister.

1362
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:59,010
- Lady, I don't even know you.

1363
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:01,483
- Sydney loved you and you killed her.

1364
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:04,483
- Frankie.

1365
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,253
Sydney's Frankie?

1366
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:10,560
- Amazing what a 38
can do for your memory.

1367
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,860
- Look, look, look, look.

1368
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:16,573
Slow your roll, sister, aiit?

1369
01:14:17,936 --> 01:14:19,220
You don't wanna do nothing crazy.

1370
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:21,870
- I wanna know how you can
do what you did to Sydney.

1371
01:14:24,330 --> 01:14:27,233
- Frankie, think this through. Okay?

1372
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,613
It's not worth it.

1373
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,240
You and your sister, you had nothing.

1374
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,707
She didn't like you. You didn't like her.

1375
01:14:36,657 --> 01:14:39,353
You should hear some of the
things she said about you.

1376
01:14:41,757 --> 01:14:43,424
- What type of shit?

1377
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:46,583
- Like you couldn't hold a job.

1378
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:52,480
Like she always had to pay your rent.

1379
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:57,490
You got knocked up, didn't
even know who the father was.

1380
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:01,939
Always begging her for money.

1381
01:15:01,939 --> 01:15:04,827
And you know something? She had the money.

1382
01:15:04,827 --> 01:15:07,076
But she didn't give a shit about you.

1383
01:15:07,076 --> 01:15:08,960
(gun blasting)

1384
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,772
Fucking bitch!

1385
01:15:10,772 --> 01:15:13,355
(gun blasting)

1386
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:18,850
I did you a fucking favor!

1387
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:24,460
You inherited what, two, $300,000?

1388
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,270
And you wanna come in
here and do this shit?

1389
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:27,390
- When your sister's killed,

1390
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:28,990
you're supposed to do something.

1391
01:15:30,023 --> 01:15:32,660
It doesn't matter if you
didn't like each other.

1392
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:36,203
But you're supposed to do
something because you're sisters.

1393
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:39,362
- I can I have another
foot of road, bitch.

1394
01:15:39,362 --> 01:15:41,945
(gun blasting)

1395
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:35,600
- So what's up with your bag out there?

1396
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,840
I have to lend that to Frankie.

1397
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,363
She's going on another trip.

1398
01:16:51,205 --> 01:16:54,288
(bullets clattering)

1399
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:57,750
- We need to talk, but
I gotta unwind first.

1400
01:17:06,824 --> 01:17:09,241
