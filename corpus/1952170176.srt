1
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:33,646
From the great spirit
comes a unifying force

2
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:37,607
that flows through
all living things.

3
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:43,957
Through this,
we are all relatives.

4
00:00:46,393 --> 00:00:50,023
As I dance,
I remember my friend.

5
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:54,233
Most men knew him
as James Conners.

6
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:57,099
I know him
as Shadowheart.

7
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:14,186
This is the most beautiful place
in the whole wide world.

8
00:01:14,187 --> 00:01:16,956
How do you know?
You've never been anywhere else.

9
00:01:16,957 --> 00:01:21,494
I don't need to go anywhere else.
I just know.

10
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:25,080
Not me.
I'm gonna see the world.

11
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,140
Well, better get back to town.

12
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:39,741
Let's go.

13
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,407
Come on.

14
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:43,482
I'll race you to the horse.

15
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:45,348
Okay!

16
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,087
- James!
- Yes, Father?

17
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:26,091
I've been looking
all over for you.

18
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:27,593
I'm right here.

19
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:29,794
Yes, I can see that.

20
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:33,856
Bring me that can
of paint, would ya?

21
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:37,996
- Goodbye, Mary.
- Bye, James.

22
00:02:51,852 --> 00:02:56,387
Matthew... Chapter 6,
verse 14 and 15. Go.

23
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,724
"For if ye forgive
men their sins,

24
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:00,960
Your heavenly Father
will also forgive you."

25
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:02,519
Go on.

26
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:05,631
"But if ye forgive not
men their sins,

27
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:09,201
neither will your heavenly
Father forgive your sins."

28
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:11,470
You know King James
almost as well as I do.

29
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:13,272
Do you understand it?

30
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:17,333
If I did, we wouldn't
need preachers.

31
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:20,503
Fair, fair enough.

32
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:23,315
Your mother,
God rest her soul,

33
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:25,150
would be very
proud of you, James.

34
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:26,675
Yes, Father.

35
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,487
All right.
Go on back to the house.

36
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:30,422
Finish your chores
and come back here.

37
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:32,358
Come straight back here.

38
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:34,126
I need help
with the cross.

39
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:35,754
Go on.

40
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:56,075
Hey, not bad.

41
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:59,318
- How many tries?
- Eh, I stopped counting after 12.

42
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:02,187
Hey, James, let's see who can stick
the knife in the post

43
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:04,590
the most times
without missing.

44
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:06,325
Can't.
Got chores to do.

45
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:08,021
Come on.

46
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:25,804
Here, you go first.

47
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:28,942
Hey, James.

48
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:37,785
Dang!

49
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:52,028
Why do all churches
have to be white?

50
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:55,101
Tunney.

51
00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:57,939
I mean, why not blue?

52
00:04:57,978 --> 00:05:01,347
Red? Why not
a red church, Preacher?

53
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:03,215
It's not what's
on the outside that matters.

54
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:04,717
It's what's
on the inside.

55
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:07,286
It's the inside,
I like that.

56
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:08,948
Yeah.

57
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:13,993
You might want to include that
in your sermon, Preacher.

58
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:16,128
What do you want, Tunney?

59
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:19,765
Well, you've been paying
the note on this property

60
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:22,635
to a Mr. Rusty Knudsen, yeah?

61
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:24,103
Right.

62
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:25,871
- For about five years now.
- Uh-huh.

63
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:27,533
And it appears

64
00:05:27,574 --> 00:05:30,142
that Mr. Knudsen
had himself

65
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:31,644
what you might call

66
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:34,213
a stroke of bad luck
last night at the poker table,

67
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:36,815
and I had me
what you might call

68
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:38,717
a streak of good luck.

69
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:41,348
And I now own that deed.

70
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:45,135
Rusty was a patient man.

71
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:47,092
Gave me time
to pay it off.

72
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:50,723
I never been one
for the whole...

73
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:53,098
patience thing.
It just kinda slows down the future

74
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:57,102
and in my future,
I can see in my future...

75
00:05:57,103 --> 00:05:59,638
that I'm foreclosing
on your property

76
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,274
if you don't pay me in full
in the next two days.

77
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:04,743
You can't do that, Tunney.

78
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:06,507
Well...

79
00:06:06,546 --> 00:06:08,147
I can even do it
in one day, Preacher.

80
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:11,016
I built this church with my two hands.

81
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:12,882
Yeah.

82
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:15,834
And fine job
you done too.

83
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:18,557
Except for the lack
of color...

84
00:06:18,558 --> 00:06:21,760
and the fact that you
built it on my land.

85
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:25,330
This is a struggling parish.
Where are we gonna get that kinda money?

86
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:27,424
Well...

87
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,480
you could try praying.

88
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:38,877
I am not gonna
lose this church...

89
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:41,113
to a man who runs
with prostitutes!

90
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:43,878
Not a lot of running,

91
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:45,475
mostly lying.

92
00:06:45,518 --> 00:06:47,850
Yeah.

93
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:52,057
You know what?
You just got yourself one day, Preacher.

94
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:54,049
I'm thinking-

95
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:57,724
I'm thinking a nice
burgundy red.

96
00:06:58,031 --> 00:06:59,692
Yeah.

97
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:07,199
What was that?

98
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:14,770
Oh

99
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:17,474
You

100
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,658
Father!

101
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,464
Father!

102
00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:45,140
I'm sorry, James.

103
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:47,009
I'm so sorry.

104
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:50,979
Remember what I taught you.

105
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:58,952
Forgive men their sins
and the Almighty will forgive you yours.

106
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:01,720
Seek not vengeance.

107
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,094
No good can c...

108
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:13,568
Father, no! No!

109
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:32,224
I'm sorry, folks.
Let me through.

110
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:34,455
Oh God.

111
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:45,537
- What happened here, Tunney?
- It was an honest mistake, Sheriff.

112
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:47,597
You see...

113
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:50,943
me and the preacher,
we was having a powwow

114
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:53,779
about uh... uh...
some money he owes me.

115
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,280
And then I turn my back,

116
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:58,083
he pulls out his hammer.
I think he gonna throw it at me.

117
00:08:58,084 --> 00:09:00,085
I mean, we all know
what a temper he has,

118
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:01,519
So...

119
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:03,121
I shoot him in self-defense.

120
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:06,325
I wasn't aware that Preacher Conners
had a temper problem.

121
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:09,261
Well, he did.

122
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:11,463
Yes, sir. So am I
under arrest, Sheriff,

123
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:13,159
or what?

124
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:18,036
We have any witnesses?
We have any witnesses here?

125
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:21,139
- Anybody see this?
- I saw it, Sheriff.

126
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,975
- Me too.
- I seen the whole thing.

127
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:26,445
- It happened exactly like he said.
- Just like Will here said.

128
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:28,812
You sure?

129
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:31,908
Yes, sir.

130
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:34,987
- Yep.
- Well, that be that then.

131
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:38,048
Mind if I have
my gun back?

132
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:40,716
Sheriff?

133
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,294
Merci beaucoup.

134
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:43,896
And you know
where to find me.

135
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:45,797
Uh, boys,
I don't know your names,

136
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:49,433
but I'd like
to buy you a drink.

137
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:53,063
All righty.
Whoa whoa whoa.

138
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,707
Lord have mercy,
look at you.

139
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,369
Just come here.

140
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,645
You're an angel
from above, hmm?

141
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:01,747
Mighty fine
bone structure.

142
00:10:01,748 --> 00:10:03,548
Tell me, what's your name,
little girl?

143
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:04,846
Come here.

144
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:07,552
You come see me
in a few years.

145
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:10,943
Right over
at the saloon, okay?

146
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:18,830
He just murdered my father and you're
not going to do anything about it?

147
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:20,933
He claims he acted
in self-defense

148
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:23,101
and he's got two witnesses
to back him up.

149
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:25,003
I'm sorry, James.
I really am.

150
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:26,938
I'm sorry.

151
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:40,819
I'm innocent.
I'm innocent.

152
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,587
- It was self-defense.
- Yeah, and pigs fly.

153
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,360
Wait wait wait.
Oh-oh-oh-oh.

154
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:51,371
Oh, you wanna
kill me, boy.

155
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:54,766
You wanna hurt me bad.
Come over here.

156
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:56,758
Come over here.

157
00:10:56,803 --> 00:10:58,828
Come on, boy.

158
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:01,356
That's right.
Step up.

159
00:11:04,844 --> 00:11:06,899
How you doing, hmm?

160
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:10,441
Awww.

161
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:13,952
You're hurtin' bad.
Well, see, my daddy...

162
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:15,443
he taught me

163
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:18,857
to keep this knife razor sharp
for a day like this.

164
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:20,553
Go on, take it.

165
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:22,185
Take it, boy.

166
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,431
Ah! Now you cut
my throat. Go on.

167
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:29,587
Just like a pig.
You cut me.

168
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:32,871
Take a man's vengeance.
Come on!

169
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:37,109
Come on! I'll even
closed my eyes for ya.

170
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,476
Come on.

171
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:42,908
I can feel it coming.

172
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:51,190
Awww!

173
00:11:52,592 --> 00:11:54,560
Good boy.

174
00:11:56,262 --> 00:11:59,364
I'll tell you what, boy... now shoo.

175
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:01,233
Come back when
you're man enough.

176
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:03,624
And we'll finish this.

177
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:07,532
Hear?

178
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:15,113
For that rainy day!

179
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:16,615
Hey! Rainy day!

180
00:12:16,616 --> 00:12:18,116
To that rainy day.

181
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:19,607
Yes, sir!

182
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:35,335
I knew that you'd be here.

183
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,239
The whole town's been
looking for you, James.

184
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,141
Let 'em look.
I'm not going back there.

185
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:45,043
You can stay with us.

186
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:46,807
Thanks the same.

187
00:12:47,914 --> 00:12:49,848
Are you coming
back to Legend?

188
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:52,851
When I do,
it'll be to kill Will Tunney.

189
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:55,987
- But, James, your father said that...
- My father's dead.

190
00:12:55,988 --> 00:12:58,423
You better go back,
it'll be dark soon.

191
00:12:58,424 --> 00:13:00,992
- Where will you go?
- I don't know, I...

192
00:13:00,993 --> 00:13:03,095
I have an aunt and uncle
in Mobile, Alabama.

193
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:05,097
That's a thousand
miles away.

194
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:07,896
I don't care!

195
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:11,609
- I best get going.
- James, wait!

196
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:19,619
So that you'll
remember me.

197
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:27,812
Come on, now.

198
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,438
Run, little boy!

199
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:26,970
Boy, where are ya?

200
00:14:28,548 --> 00:14:30,815
Why don't you come home...

201
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:32,884
so we can finish this...

202
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:34,819
...boy?

203
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:52,343
A little bit
jumpy there, Conners?

204
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:56,541
Seems like you got
something on your conscience.

205
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:59,697
Now me,
I sleep like a baby.

206
00:15:01,714 --> 00:15:03,705
Shut up, Haines.

207
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:05,774
Good night.

208
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:28,039
Sangre de Cristo
Mountains, Conners.

209
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,134
The blood of Christ.

210
00:15:31,177 --> 00:15:33,278
I know
what it is, Haines.

211
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,481
Yea, though I ride through the valley
of the shadow of death

212
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:41,453
I shall fear no evil
for thou art with me, Conners.

213
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:45,084
Thy knife
and thy gun comfort me.

214
00:15:46,892 --> 00:15:50,662
You ain't much for religion,
are you, Conners?

215
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:52,831
See, that concerns me.

216
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:55,433
I'm worried
about your soul.

217
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:58,494
How do you
know I have one?

218
00:16:17,456 --> 00:16:19,219
Go go go!

219
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:39,277
Bringing these hostiles
out of Canyon de Chelly,

220
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:40,879
putting 'em
on a reservation.

221
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,115
They don't look
very hostile to me.

222
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:45,947
Neither does he.

223
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:49,888
We're gonna put
8,000 of them there...

224
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:52,223
if they're smart enough
to surrender.

225
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:55,352
Give 'em five-minutes' rest.

226
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:57,729
No water. And watch out
for that buck over there.

227
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:01,132
If he gets half a chance,
he'll slit your throat.

228
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:02,998
Yes, sir.

229
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:30,595
''The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

230
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:32,831
He leadeth me
by still water

231
00:17:32,832 --> 00:17:35,032
for His name's sake.

232
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:39,955
Thy rod and Thy staff
comfort me.''

233
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:48,012
Put an end to it, Preacher.

234
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:50,682
These heathens
don't need religion.

235
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:54,018
They're gonna be farmers
if it kills them...

236
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:56,264
and it probably will.

237
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:18,822
Hey, what are you doing?

238
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:33,324
What'd you do that for?
That's my lucky knife.

239
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:38,055
Well, I don't think
you'll need it, Haines.

240
00:18:56,715 --> 00:19:01,820
Long ride, Conners.
How about you buy me a drink?

241
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:05,931
We'll call it sort of
a last request.

242
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:10,528
What are you in such
a hurry for, huh?

243
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:13,031
What, you gonna catch up
with that Injun party?

244
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:17,332
I saw that look
you and that squaw had.

245
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:26,304
What's going on here?

246
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:28,580
Got a wild one here.

247
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:30,915
Yeah, well,
who's collecting?

248
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,612
James Conners.

249
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:36,467
- Conners.
- That's right.

250
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:38,857
Well, I'll be damned.

251
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:40,492
You're one lucky man.

252
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:44,496
Conners here usually
brings 'em in more dead than alive.

253
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:46,556
Yeah, real lucky.

254
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,799
All right, let's go.

255
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:39,217
The suspense
is killing me.

256
00:20:39,218 --> 00:20:41,286
Why don't you
get to the point...

257
00:20:41,287 --> 00:20:43,154
where I give a damn?

258
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:46,391
Yes, Mr. Mayor. It looks like it will
now come out of Denver,

259
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:48,526
head directly south
via Pueblo,

260
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:51,896
skirt the eastern side
of the Sangre de Cristos

261
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:54,165
through Cimarron
and then southwest

262
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,656
to Santa Fe.

263
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:58,703
And come thundering right through
our lovely little town of Legend.

264
00:20:58,704 --> 00:21:01,205
When the tracks are laid,
the Pacific Railroad

265
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:03,107
will deliver more
business to this town

266
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:05,443
than you've ever imagined.

267
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:06,978
Right at my doorstep?

268
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:09,180
- More or less.
- More or less?

269
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:12,650
- You better hope more than less.
- Yes, of course.

270
00:21:12,651 --> 00:21:15,882
You see, I have bought

271
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:18,289
every single piece of
property here in Legend

272
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,157
based on your advice.

273
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:23,561
And some people have died

274
00:21:23,562 --> 00:21:26,364
based on your advice
here in Legend.

275
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:29,300
Accidentally, of course.

276
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:31,565
I can assure you,

277
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:33,771
their value will
more than triple.

278
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:35,399
However...

279
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:36,908
However.

280
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:38,676
There ain't no howevers.

281
00:21:38,677 --> 00:21:41,312
Your 10% lawyer fee don't
include no howevers.

282
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:43,543
15%, actually.

283
00:21:45,784 --> 00:21:47,485
How... how... regardless,

284
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:49,120
I do have to point out,

285
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:52,457
there is still a parcel of land
that you do not yet own.

286
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,593
- You didn't make 'em an offer yet?
- Oh, yes, I did.

287
00:21:55,594 --> 00:21:58,596
Howev...but they seem
to be stalling.

288
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:00,632
I fear that if they
see the surveyor,

289
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:02,533
they may raise
their asking price.

290
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:04,435
Yeah... Spider'll
take care of that.

291
00:22:04,436 --> 00:22:08,395
- Who?
- Spider.

292
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:15,246
Spider. Pleasure
to make your acquaintance...

293
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:16,874
Esquire.

294
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,490
Aw, relax, Garrick.

295
00:22:31,997 --> 00:22:34,627
The future's on its way.

296
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:37,301
And l'm gonna make sure

297
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:41,217
you catch the bouquet
at my wedding.

298
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:57,321
I'm supposed to eat this?

299
00:22:57,322 --> 00:22:59,157
I'm just saying,
I don't know what part

300
00:22:59,158 --> 00:23:01,592
- of the chicken that is.
- Okay, stop it. I'm trying to...

301
00:23:01,593 --> 00:23:04,028
- Can I eat my dinner in peace?
- What would you say that is?

302
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:06,964
I would say it's something you don't
have to eat, that's what I would say.

303
00:23:06,965 --> 00:23:09,701
- Every town, it's the same thing.
- It's not every town.

304
00:23:09,702 --> 00:23:12,170
No, you pick something out
on your plate you can't identify,

305
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:14,238
- and suddenly, it's like poison.
- But it's not every town.

306
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:16,107
But see, I'm also eating with you.
So we eat together.

307
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:19,143
I know, but you
seem to enjoy it.

308
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:21,078
Thanks, ma'am.

309
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:23,781
- It is every town.
- No, it is not.

310
00:23:23,782 --> 00:23:26,551
- I mean, two stops ago...
- How's your supper, gentlemen?

311
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:29,420
- Just excellent.
- Thank you.

312
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:33,024
Definitely the best
we've had since, um...

313
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:34,492
Reno.

314
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:37,762
For your entertainment
after supper,

315
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:39,664
there are games
of chance in the back.

316
00:23:39,665 --> 00:23:42,200
And if you wish for some
female companionship,

317
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:44,235
that's available upstairs.

318
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:46,404
Just inquire with Billy
at the bar.

319
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:48,372
Just ask Billy?
Oh, well then...

320
00:23:48,373 --> 00:23:50,408
excuse me, I was just
wondering if, um,

321
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:52,810
- if you were...
- You might be...

322
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:55,813
- I mean...
- I only work downstairs.

323
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:58,204
Of course.
I'm sorry.

324
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,086
She only works
downstairs.

325
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:06,491
It was an embarrassing question,
but I asked it for your sake.

326
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:08,357
More for you two?

327
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:22,820
You know that this stuff's
real strong.

328
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:28,383
I'll be right back.

329
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:32,817
Evening, Mary.
You look tired.

330
00:24:32,818 --> 00:24:34,886
You want to take the weight off,
to make up?

331
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:36,921
I'm... I'm fine, thanks.
I'm busy.

332
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:39,117
Well, I was, uh...

333
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:41,893
Hey, piano man!
Stop playing that music!

334
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:43,961
Can't hear myself think.

335
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:46,030
Now, Mary... Mary...

336
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:49,567
I... I was looking for you this morning
before your shift, you know.

337
00:24:49,568 --> 00:24:51,936
- I went ridin'.
- Yeah, you always go ridin'.

338
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:54,539
- I like to ride.
- Yeah, so do I.

339
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,108
- It's fun.
- I like to ride alone.

340
00:24:57,109 --> 00:24:59,236
Yeah, well...

341
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:01,479
soon that will change.

342
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,982
You're only gonna wanna
ride with me, yeah?

343
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:06,851
- Look, Will...
- Yeah?

344
00:25:06,852 --> 00:25:09,687
I'm only workin' here
to keep you from throwing my brother

345
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:11,522
out of the livery
that we own.

346
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:13,514
Owned.

347
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:16,794
And there are some
benefits to being owned.

348
00:25:16,795 --> 00:25:18,462
You know what I'm saying?

349
00:25:18,463 --> 00:25:20,598
I don't plan on sticking
around to find out.

350
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,863
Oh yeah?
Someday...

351
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:24,926
soon...

352
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,360
I'm gonna stop
asking politely.

353
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:30,407
My angel.

354
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:33,787
I gotta... I gotta get to work.

355
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:44,856
- What the hell are you looking at, Tom?
- Nothing, Will.

356
00:25:44,857 --> 00:25:47,437
Then eat your damn food.

357
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:06,711
What's the trouble, Will?

358
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:09,237
The trouble is...

359
00:26:09,281 --> 00:26:11,215
I...I put this
woman on a pedestal

360
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:14,181
and now I can't
reach her.

361
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:18,515
Then knock it down.

362
00:26:19,758 --> 00:26:22,338
Make her crawl
back up.

363
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:29,894
Get off, Velma!

364
00:26:30,969 --> 00:26:33,170
Go make me some money.

365
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:35,435
I'll be upstairs...

366
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:37,499
if you care.

367
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:39,832
Without any pedestals.

368
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:07,434
You reshoe
our horses yet?

369
00:27:09,308 --> 00:27:11,142
Hey there, Mr. Finch.

370
00:27:11,143 --> 00:27:12,940
Yeah.

371
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:14,679
I'll get to it,
right when I'm done

372
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,515
finishing off the real
customers' horses.

373
00:27:17,516 --> 00:27:19,750
Mr. Tunney is
your real customer.

374
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:21,719
And he's also
your boss.

375
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,244
Really?

376
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:27,224
Well, I thought
this was my livery.

377
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:28,793
Handed down to me
by my father.

378
00:27:28,794 --> 00:27:31,796
- But...
- And taken by my boss.

379
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:35,733
You don't like it,
you can always leave.

380
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:39,770
Without your lovely sister,
of course.

381
00:27:39,771 --> 00:27:44,211
Come on, stable boy,
take your best shot.

382
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:47,073
Not as dumb as you look.

383
00:27:48,613 --> 00:27:51,082
Wish I could
say the same for you.

384
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,573
What?

385
00:27:52,617 --> 00:27:55,518
Hmm? Hmm?

386
00:27:55,554 --> 00:27:57,488
Huh, boy? Huh?

387
00:27:57,522 --> 00:28:00,650
- What?
- Nothing.

388
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:03,527
Mr. Tunney and I are
riding out come daybreak.

389
00:28:03,528 --> 00:28:08,543
You have his gray
and my sorrel ready by then.

390
00:28:09,401 --> 00:28:10,732
Yes, sir.

391
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:24,229
Anything you want,
Mr. Finch.

392
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:27,818
Just tell Tunney
I'll be right here.

393
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:30,399
Right where you need me.

394
00:28:33,425 --> 00:28:35,955
Well, hello, stable boy.

395
00:28:37,195 --> 00:28:38,890
Conners.

396
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:43,999
Look at you.
Look at you.

397
00:28:44,036 --> 00:28:46,103
You're all grown up.

398
00:28:46,104 --> 00:28:49,840
And you're...
and you're hairy and...

399
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:53,944
and you're kinda scary lookin',
tell you the truth.

400
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:56,847
So what you been
up to all these years?

401
00:28:56,848 --> 00:28:59,583
Nothing worth talking about.

402
00:28:59,584 --> 00:29:01,916
How's your pop been?

403
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:05,222
He died about
four years back.

404
00:29:05,223 --> 00:29:06,924
Sorry about that.

405
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:11,228
Better he ain't around,
seeing his son lose his livery.

406
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:12,763
- What happened?
- Ah...

407
00:29:12,764 --> 00:29:14,398
it was a weak moment.

408
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,868
Will sent a couple of women of a...
questionable profession

409
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:19,769
over to my place.

410
00:29:19,805 --> 00:29:22,506
And, uh, there was free
whisky and all that, so,

411
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:24,375
you know,
stumbled into a saloon,

412
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:26,310
lost the deed
in two hands.

413
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:28,696
- You gamble?
- Never.

414
00:29:29,714 --> 00:29:33,964
Those whores had
gotten the best of me.

415
00:29:38,423 --> 00:29:40,414
Yup.

416
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:45,329
Tunney had it painted
the day after you left.

417
00:29:47,632 --> 00:29:50,868
Well, I should say
Mayor Tunney.

418
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:52,236
Mayor Tunney?

419
00:29:52,237 --> 00:29:53,602
Yes, sir.

420
00:29:54,906 --> 00:29:57,875
Hmm...You seen Mary yet?

421
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:01,209
No.

422
00:30:01,246 --> 00:30:02,780
Don't know if I plan to.

423
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:05,011
Mm...hmm.

424
00:30:06,084 --> 00:30:08,052
Course you don't.

425
00:30:09,955 --> 00:30:13,540
Come on, let's go
get some grub.

426
00:30:53,165 --> 00:30:55,929
Evening.

427
00:30:59,171 --> 00:31:05,171
If you're looking for Velma,
she works out of the saloon.

428
00:31:12,017 --> 00:31:14,837
I'm not looking for Velma.

429
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:42,506
Let's get
this next reading.

430
00:32:42,507 --> 00:32:44,842
Okay, I just walked
the last two miles.

431
00:32:44,843 --> 00:32:46,910
Fine, then I'm
on the transit.

432
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:48,545
I am on the transit
in New Mexico,

433
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:50,180
You are on
the transit in Utah.

434
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:53,096
Did you just
make that up?

435
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:55,519
- We'll flip for it.
- Fine, let's flip for it.

436
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,054
- Heads or tails?
- Heads.

437
00:32:57,055 --> 00:32:58,555
- Wait. Tails.
- Tails.

438
00:32:58,556 --> 00:33:00,024
Heads! Heads. Heads.

439
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:02,126
- I'll take heads, definitely.
- Are you sure now?

440
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:03,761
Yeah. Wait.
What did I say?

441
00:33:03,762 --> 00:33:05,329
- Heads.
- Fine, heads.

442
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:09,055
- Heads it is.
- No more go-backs.

443
00:33:25,483 --> 00:33:27,084
Morning, gentlemen.

444
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:29,219
- Good morning.
- Howdy.

445
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,515
Which one of you
is Griffiths?

446
00:33:32,824 --> 00:33:34,992
- That'd be me.
- That must make you O'Toole.

447
00:33:34,993 --> 00:33:37,361
That's right.
How do you know our names?

448
00:33:37,362 --> 00:33:40,992
Well, you're staying
at my hotel.

449
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,732
Well...

450
00:33:47,772 --> 00:33:50,874
I...I'm hearing that you boys
are running some kind of...

451
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:53,207
railroad through here?

452
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:55,979
We're just out here doing
some preliminary measurements.

453
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,982
We're in negotiations
with the person who owns this land

454
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:00,517
to possibly cut through.

455
00:34:00,518 --> 00:34:04,143
Yeah, well,
negotiations are over.

456
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:20,603
Landowner signed over dinner.
The steak was a bit rare.

457
00:34:20,872 --> 00:34:23,874
It looks like you drew
your line wrong here.

458
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:26,076
No. Uh, based
on elevation and incline,

459
00:34:26,077 --> 00:34:28,612
rock and soil samples...
you know, science?

460
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:31,148
Uh, that is the best place
to lay railroad tracks.

461
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:33,450
- Best.
- Yeah, well, I'm no surveyor,

462
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:35,746
but it seems to me...

463
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:39,490
like the line needs
to go right through here...

464
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:41,482
town of Legend.

465
00:34:41,526 --> 00:34:43,994
Actually, because
of our instructions, we...

466
00:34:43,995 --> 00:34:46,630
In fact, I'd bet
your life on it,

467
00:34:46,631 --> 00:34:48,591
the both of youse.

468
00:34:56,307 --> 00:34:58,909
And my best advice to you

469
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,065
would be to take
your pencil... go on.

470
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:07,621
You draw a line
right there.

471
00:35:08,052 --> 00:35:09,952
Go on.

472
00:35:09,988 --> 00:35:13,668
Just move it over
a half an inch.

473
00:35:17,562 --> 00:35:19,496
Oh, that's good.
That's a really good line.

474
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:22,499
- How do you like it?
- I do, I like it.

475
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,968
Yeah, you do fine work
with that pencil.

476
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:28,905
Mr., uh...
"Davinky."

477
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,008
- Actually, it's Da Vinci...
- Mm-mm-mm.

478
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:34,172
- What's that?
- Never mind.

479
00:35:34,212 --> 00:35:36,814
Yeah, well, you just
make sure that the line

480
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:39,395
stays right where it is.

481
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:42,887
I'll take this.

482
00:36:13,117 --> 00:36:15,886
Took me almost a year
to make my way back to Alabama

483
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:17,788
and find
my aunt and uncle.

484
00:36:17,789 --> 00:36:19,656
Things were okay
for a while...

485
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:21,617
till the war came.

486
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,128
Our farm didn't
have slaves.

487
00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:28,532
We were part of the confederacy
just the same.

488
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:30,501
Had no choice
but to fight for the gray.

489
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:33,752
How long were you
in the war?

490
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:36,016
Too long,
I suspect.

491
00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:39,409
Long enough to know
that God doesn't favor man.

492
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,310
James.

493
00:36:42,313 --> 00:36:43,905
Mary, I...

494
00:36:43,948 --> 00:36:46,416
I've seen too many
terrible things...

495
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:51,221
terrible things that no God
could just stand by and watch.

496
00:36:51,222 --> 00:36:53,690
- Man is on his own.
- How can you say that, James?

497
00:36:53,691 --> 00:36:55,359
Your father
was a preacher.

498
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,225
And God really favored him.

499
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:14,241
Do you really believe that?

500
00:37:15,813 --> 00:37:17,814
- I've done too many things, Mary.
- Shh.

501
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:20,648
Just let go.

502
00:37:20,685 --> 00:37:23,287
Now you do sound
like my father.

503
00:37:23,288 --> 00:37:26,393
Your father
was a great man.

504
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:35,390
Hey...

505
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:38,298
I have an idea:

506
00:37:38,336 --> 00:37:40,137
What if we just start over

507
00:37:40,138 --> 00:37:41,939
and we pretend
like you never left?

508
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,509
All these years,
we just stayed the same

509
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,171
in our hearts.

510
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:51,788
I never did forget, Mary.

511
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:55,252
All I had to do was
hold onto your ribbon

512
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:57,453
and I was back home.

513
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:00,922
That's back here.

514
00:38:02,026 --> 00:38:05,596
I came out here
every day since you left...

515
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:10,847
just hoping and praying
that you would come home.

516
00:38:12,437 --> 00:38:16,642
I should've came back
a long time ago.

517
00:38:16,908 --> 00:38:19,206
I've gotta ask you...

518
00:38:20,612 --> 00:38:22,379
did you come back
to kill Will Tunney?

519
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:27,751
'Cause that's the last thing
I ever heard you say.

520
00:38:27,752 --> 00:38:30,857
There's going
to be justice.

521
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:35,703
But I don't want
no more killing.

522
00:38:39,263 --> 00:38:43,133
I just want to make up
for lost time.

523
00:38:43,134 --> 00:38:46,479
How do you propose
we do that?

524
00:38:52,944 --> 00:38:55,640
Oh, yes, sir.

525
00:38:55,713 --> 00:38:58,649
I think she needs
a new coat...

526
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,675
of paint.

527
00:39:02,387 --> 00:39:03,877
Whoo!

528
00:39:03,921 --> 00:39:06,723
Things are back
on track, Garrick.

529
00:39:06,724 --> 00:39:09,960
I'm gonna take this town
into the 20th century

530
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:12,262
if I have to drag it
kicking and screaming.

531
00:39:12,263 --> 00:39:14,331
Kicking and screaming.

532
00:39:14,332 --> 00:39:16,867
Excellent, Mr. Mayor.
How wonderful.

533
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:19,208
Did you know, Garrick,

534
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:23,152
I never rid
a railroad track before?

535
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:27,710
Why wait, Tunney?

536
00:39:27,745 --> 00:39:30,614
I'm sure you can catch
a ride anywhere but here.

537
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:33,550
Ah. And you are?

538
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:36,553
I'm here to buy
this church.

539
00:39:36,554 --> 00:39:38,855
Well, it ain't for sale.

540
00:39:38,856 --> 00:39:40,424
And it ain't no church.

541
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:42,325
It was a church.

542
00:39:45,029 --> 00:39:47,849
It was my father's church.

543
00:39:51,202 --> 00:39:53,832
Do you know who this is?

544
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:58,504
Conners...
Good God Almighty.

545
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:00,177
All grown up and...

546
00:40:00,178 --> 00:40:02,646
whiskers and all.

547
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,781
I didn't ever think
I'd see your gutless hide

548
00:40:04,782 --> 00:40:07,982
in this town
of Legend again.

549
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:16,660
That's the amount
my father owed you

550
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:19,496
on the note
when you killed him.

551
00:40:19,497 --> 00:40:22,697
Take it, count it,
and leave.

552
00:40:24,669 --> 00:40:27,137
Well...

553
00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:32,297
I ain't going nowhere.

554
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:37,695
You see, I own
this town now.

555
00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:40,748
Yep, all of it mine.

556
00:40:40,785 --> 00:40:43,185
And I'm the mayor,

557
00:40:43,221 --> 00:40:46,890
and soon-to-be husband
of your long-lost Mary.

558
00:40:46,891 --> 00:40:49,659
I suggest you be gone
by sundown, Tunney.

559
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,026
Oh, sundown.

560
00:40:52,063 --> 00:40:55,332
Sundown. Sunny side up.
No, ain't going nowhere.

561
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:57,028
Okay.

562
00:40:59,403 --> 00:41:03,418
You want to see
what that is? Go on.

563
00:41:04,742 --> 00:41:07,802
What have we here?

564
00:41:07,845 --> 00:41:10,370
Oh, yeah.

565
00:41:10,414 --> 00:41:12,315
Yeah, I...I remember
that night.

566
00:41:12,316 --> 00:41:14,384
Yeah.
That...that fellow

567
00:41:14,385 --> 00:41:16,419
was in the wrong place
at the right time,

568
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,095
just like your daddy was.

569
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:28,265
I'm glad to see you
took care of my knife.

570
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:31,656
You can leave town
now, lawyer.

571
00:41:32,303 --> 00:41:34,965
Uh-uh!
Without those.

572
00:41:35,006 --> 00:41:39,206
Yes, sir. I...I'm leaving
straightaway.

573
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:45,248
You tell me something, boy.
When you woke up this morning,

574
00:41:45,249 --> 00:41:49,404
did you know
you were gonna die today?

575
00:41:55,693 --> 00:41:57,761
How about you, Tunney?
Did you get up this morning

576
00:41:57,762 --> 00:42:03,762
knowing you were gonna be aired out
like the morning laundry?

577
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:24,642
No more free drinks
for you tonight, Samuel.

578
00:42:52,216 --> 00:42:55,986
What's the meaning
of this, stranger?

579
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:57,687
This man is wanted
for the murder

580
00:42:57,688 --> 00:42:59,990
of Nathan Carnes two years ago
in Jamison County.

581
00:42:59,991 --> 00:43:01,825
It was self-defense, Sheriff.

582
00:43:01,826 --> 00:43:03,627
It's no more in self-defense

583
00:43:03,628 --> 00:43:09,353
- than when you murdered my father.
- James? That you?

584
00:43:09,467 --> 00:43:11,492
Your daddy...

585
00:43:11,535 --> 00:43:13,436
was a self-righteous fool

586
00:43:13,437 --> 00:43:16,806
who thought he was better
than the rest of us townsfolk.

587
00:43:16,807 --> 00:43:20,143
Yeah. Jesus was
the son of God.

588
00:43:20,144 --> 00:43:22,412
Your daddy
was a son of a bitch.

589
00:43:22,413 --> 00:43:25,482
Go ahead, shoot.
Finish the job.

590
00:43:25,483 --> 00:43:28,318
Truth is this town needs me
more than it needs you.

591
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,187
I'm the future.
You're the past.

592
00:43:31,188 --> 00:43:33,323
Should have killed you
15 years ago, boy.

593
00:43:33,324 --> 00:43:36,059
Bounty's good
dead or alive, Tunney.

594
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,495
I think I'd prefer dead.

595
00:43:38,496 --> 00:43:40,981
Hey, hold it.
Hold it.

596
00:43:51,943 --> 00:43:53,877
I'm waiting, boy.

597
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:56,004
I'm waiting.

598
00:43:57,148 --> 00:43:58,945
Don't do it.

599
00:43:58,983 --> 00:44:01,281
I'm waiting.

600
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:07,216
Yeah.

601
00:44:07,258 --> 00:44:10,888
You still don't
have the stomach.

602
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:16,055
Lock him up.

603
00:44:18,736 --> 00:44:21,805
Mary...Mary, what the hell
you doing with him?

604
00:44:21,806 --> 00:44:25,101
Mary, you come
here now. Mary!

605
00:45:00,644 --> 00:45:02,879
Marshal in Jamison
confirmed the killing

606
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,914
of Nathan Carnes
by Mr. Tunney.

607
00:45:04,915 --> 00:45:07,550
Said if we wait a couple days,
he can meet us halfway.

608
00:45:07,551 --> 00:45:09,419
How far is halfway?

609
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,456
You know I get the piles
if I have to ride too far.

610
00:45:13,457 --> 00:45:15,191
Reckon a day and a half,
maybe two.

611
00:45:15,192 --> 00:45:18,677
- All right, we'll wait.
- Whoo!

612
00:45:19,697 --> 00:45:21,865
- Want me to...
- Come on there, Brian.

613
00:45:21,866 --> 00:45:24,934
No no. That's all right, Brian.
Forget it.

614
00:45:24,935 --> 00:45:27,037
- Good night, Sheriff.
- Night.

615
00:45:27,038 --> 00:45:30,440
Night. Mind the bedbugs
don't bite.

616
00:45:30,441 --> 00:45:34,138
If they do,
get a shoe, beat 'em

617
00:45:34,178 --> 00:45:37,283
till they're
black and blue.

618
00:45:45,523 --> 00:45:49,058
Oh, that's
a dumb move, Sheriff.

619
00:45:50,394 --> 00:45:55,229
Sheriff? Sheriff?

620
00:45:55,266 --> 00:45:59,135
Why don't I just get you
a nice "checkmate"?

621
00:45:59,136 --> 00:46:01,036
I'm thinking...

622
00:46:01,072 --> 00:46:02,596
tall,

623
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,130
European,

624
00:46:04,175 --> 00:46:07,201
Velma's the best in town.

625
00:46:07,244 --> 00:46:09,542
No, thanks.

626
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:14,184
Why not? Not like you
haven't partaken before.

627
00:46:14,185 --> 00:46:18,755
Fortunately, that part of me
no longer has a say in the matter.

628
00:46:18,756 --> 00:46:20,256
How old are you?

629
00:46:20,257 --> 00:46:22,851
- 60? 65?
- 71.

630
00:46:22,893 --> 00:46:24,451
71.

631
00:46:24,495 --> 00:46:28,488
Well, I take
my hat off to you.

632
00:46:28,532 --> 00:46:30,700
You have fulfilled
your civic duty.

633
00:46:30,701 --> 00:46:32,469
It's time for you to, uh,

634
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:37,040
experience the financial
ease of your twilight years.

635
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:38,908
10 years ago,
I would have taken you up

636
00:46:38,909 --> 00:46:40,677
on your first offer.

637
00:46:40,678 --> 00:46:44,380
Five years ago, I would have taken
you up on your second.

638
00:46:44,381 --> 00:46:46,716
But right now,
in my twilight years,

639
00:46:46,717 --> 00:46:50,732
all I've earned
is a life of regret.

640
00:46:51,055 --> 00:46:53,353
Checkmate.

641
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:56,059
I should have locked you up
15 years ago.

642
00:46:56,060 --> 00:47:01,030
Now shut the hell up
or I'll hang you myself.

643
00:48:33,857 --> 00:48:37,822
Let's go, Tunney.
It's judgment day.

644
00:48:57,014 --> 00:48:58,242
Sheriff!

645
00:49:00,184 --> 00:49:01,784
Hold on, hold on.

646
00:49:01,785 --> 00:49:03,686
Let me grab my horse
and I'll ride with you guys.

647
00:49:03,687 --> 00:49:06,756
Well, that's okay, James.
Uh, I'll take it from here.

648
00:49:06,757 --> 00:49:09,726
Hey, he's still my prisoner.

649
00:49:09,727 --> 00:49:13,597
Not anymore.
He's with the law now.

650
00:49:18,502 --> 00:49:22,797
You make sure you
ride straight through.

651
00:49:23,741 --> 00:49:26,609
You can change its color,
but it's still my property.

652
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:28,611
Load 'em up.
Let's move out.

653
00:49:28,612 --> 00:49:32,315
Mary, don't you do
anything foolish now

654
00:49:32,316 --> 00:49:37,887
that gonna stop you from
wearing white at our wedding.

655
00:49:37,888 --> 00:49:40,189
Mary had a little lamb.

656
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:42,910
Little lamb.
Little lamb.

657
00:49:59,243 --> 00:50:01,143
You'd better go.

658
00:50:01,178 --> 00:50:02,509
Why?

659
00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:04,878
Bad luck. Go!

660
00:50:04,915 --> 00:50:08,640
The barber's waiting
for you. Get!

661
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:18,328
We are gathered here today
to celebrate the marriage

662
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:22,891
Of James Conners
and Mary Cooper.

663
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:26,562
It is a time to rejoice.

664
00:50:26,603 --> 00:50:28,805
And it is also a time

665
00:50:28,806 --> 00:50:31,721
to give thanks to the Lord.

666
00:50:41,185 --> 00:50:43,319
- Okay, hold it up! Hold up! Hold up!
- Whoa.

667
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,710
I gotta rest a minute.

668
00:50:47,524 --> 00:50:53,363
Hey, Sheriff, how's that
long ride treating your behind?

669
00:50:53,364 --> 00:50:57,867
You know something?
Why don't we just turn around...

670
00:50:57,868 --> 00:51:01,504
head back to town for a nice
little drink in my saloon?

671
00:51:01,505 --> 00:51:04,440
Let bygones be bygones.
Turn the other cheek.

672
00:51:04,441 --> 00:51:06,209
What do you say?

673
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:08,940
Hey, Brian.

674
00:51:08,979 --> 00:51:10,847
Another peep out of him,

675
00:51:10,848 --> 00:51:14,350
you got my permission to blow
him out of the saddle.

676
00:51:14,351 --> 00:51:17,836
Brian, live
and let live, right?

677
00:51:32,603 --> 00:51:34,570
Do you have the rings?

678
00:51:34,571 --> 00:51:36,596
Yes, sir.

679
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,369
Oh.

680
00:51:38,409 --> 00:51:41,071
Oh, I'm sorry.

681
00:51:46,016 --> 00:51:47,745
Whoa!

682
00:51:52,022 --> 00:51:54,957
Whoo! Six shots, Sheriff.

683
00:51:54,992 --> 00:51:58,060
It's time for you
to reload, by my count.

684
00:51:58,061 --> 00:52:00,997
Now my boys here
would be happy to sit by

685
00:52:00,998 --> 00:52:02,932
and watch you
refill your pistol,

686
00:52:02,933 --> 00:52:05,333
But Spider up there,

687
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:08,714
you see, he ain't
so obliging.

688
00:52:09,072 --> 00:52:12,308
I now pronounce you,
James and Mary,

689
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:14,402
husband and wife.

690
00:52:14,445 --> 00:52:17,360
You may now kiss the bride.

691
00:52:30,961 --> 00:52:34,197
Now I'm a decent
Christian fella,

692
00:52:34,198 --> 00:52:38,534
so I'm gonna abide by the law
of live and let live,

693
00:52:38,535 --> 00:52:40,169
turn the other cheek,

694
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:45,660
if you hand over the key
to these handcuffs. Finch.

695
00:52:59,756 --> 00:53:02,088
Ah, yeah.

696
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:06,395
Much obliged, Sheriff.

697
00:53:06,396 --> 00:53:08,125
Much obliged.

698
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,535
You know all that stuff
about turn the other cheek?

699
00:53:12,536 --> 00:53:14,970
Well, I lied.

700
00:55:24,601 --> 00:55:29,271
- Congratulations, sis.
- Oh! Thanks, Johnny.

701
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,401
James.

702
00:55:32,442 --> 00:55:34,103
Come here!

703
00:55:35,512 --> 00:55:37,880
Oh. You know,
he don't clean up too bad.

704
00:55:37,881 --> 00:55:40,249
- No, he doesn't.
- Yeah.

705
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,184
You take good care of her.

706
00:55:42,185 --> 00:55:43,777
I will.

707
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,687
So, um, y'all two

708
00:55:46,723 --> 00:55:48,391
headed back to town, or...

709
00:55:48,392 --> 00:55:50,426
No. No, not tonight.

710
00:55:50,427 --> 00:55:52,122
We're not?

711
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:55,998
I have a surprise for you,
Mr. Conners.

712
00:55:55,999 --> 00:55:58,134
- All right.
- Night, Johnny! Night!

713
00:55:58,135 --> 00:55:59,830
Night!

714
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:01,400
Time to leave.

715
00:56:26,697 --> 00:56:29,165
Finch, am I still mayor
of this ungrateful little town?

716
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:30,566
- Yeah, boss.
- Yep.

717
00:56:30,567 --> 00:56:32,468
Then I'm appointing
you sheriff!

718
00:56:32,469 --> 00:56:34,437
Ha ha! That makes you
my deputy, huh, Charles?

719
00:56:34,438 --> 00:56:37,273
Yeah. And your first job is to find
Conners and arrest him.

720
00:56:37,274 --> 00:56:38,741
For what?

721
00:56:38,775 --> 00:56:41,377
For the murder of Sheriff Sanders
and his deputy.

722
00:56:41,378 --> 00:56:43,073
Will!

723
00:56:43,113 --> 00:56:47,607
- Hey! How're you doing?
- Hey!

724
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:50,486
And where is my lovely
little wife-to-be?

725
00:56:50,487 --> 00:56:52,455
What?

726
00:56:52,489 --> 00:56:53,786
Mary.

727
00:56:53,824 --> 00:56:57,884
I asked you a question.
Where's Mary?

728
00:57:03,734 --> 00:57:06,979
She's celebrating
her wedding.

729
00:57:22,753 --> 00:57:25,415
- Hey!
- Hey.

730
00:57:28,258 --> 00:57:31,558
I guess it's
just me and you.

731
00:57:31,828 --> 00:57:34,126
Me and you, Ruby.

732
00:57:34,164 --> 00:57:36,732
Now you better not
go off and get married.

733
00:57:36,733 --> 00:57:39,668
I'm gonna be the one
that gets married next, if anybody is.

734
00:57:39,669 --> 00:57:42,194
Hey, stable boy.

735
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:44,440
We interrupt a little
something with your mare?

736
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:47,276
Oh no, she stopped
listening to me long time ago.

737
00:57:47,277 --> 00:57:50,192
Well, that's a smart horse.

738
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:57,119
Can I help you fellas
with anything?

739
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:00,130
Where's your sister's horse?

740
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:02,758
Don't know.

741
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,228
It's kind of late to be
out riding, isn't it?

742
00:58:06,229 --> 00:58:08,163
I guess.

743
00:58:08,198 --> 00:58:10,359
So where'd they go?

744
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,334
Where did who go?

745
00:58:13,737 --> 00:58:15,905
We're not gonna
play that game.

746
00:58:15,906 --> 00:58:18,306
He doesn't know.

747
00:58:21,278 --> 00:58:24,111
- But I do.
- Yeah? What?

748
00:58:24,147 --> 00:58:26,615
I followed her once,

749
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,984
see where she rides
off to every morning.

750
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:32,488
That's kind of
disturbing to me, Spider.

751
00:58:32,489 --> 00:58:34,081
Yeah.

752
00:58:34,124 --> 00:58:35,853
Yeah.

753
00:58:35,892 --> 00:58:37,860
Yeah.

754
00:58:37,894 --> 00:58:40,764
You don't want to do that.

755
00:58:42,332 --> 00:58:45,867
Guess who's gonna
win that game.

756
00:58:51,741 --> 00:58:56,231
Spider, why don't you
take that from him?

757
00:59:05,755 --> 00:59:07,416
Easy now.

758
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:13,859
Whew.

759
00:59:14,998 --> 00:59:17,483
Give me your hand, boy.

760
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:23,098
Give me...

761
00:59:23,139 --> 00:59:24,669
your gun hand.

762
00:59:25,775 --> 00:59:29,211
I'm pretty good
with either one.

763
00:59:29,212 --> 00:59:31,009
Show me.

764
00:59:42,659 --> 00:59:44,764
I'll take this one.

765
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:49,365
We...we could have been

766
00:59:49,366 --> 00:59:52,756
brothers-in-law,
you know that?

767
00:59:54,671 --> 00:59:57,873
You know what, Mr. Tunney?
You're gonna get yours.

768
00:59:57,874 --> 01:00:01,537
Maybe not in this life,

769
01:00:01,578 --> 01:00:03,145
but you're gonna get yours.

770
01:00:03,146 --> 01:00:04,636
Yeah.

771
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:08,744
You son of a bitch.

772
01:00:11,988 --> 01:00:14,758
Spider, take care of that.

773
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,281
Good evening,
Mr. Conners.

774
01:00:39,282 --> 01:00:42,097
Good evening, Mrs. Conners.

775
01:00:48,024 --> 01:00:51,160
This is quite the honeymoon spot
you picked out for us.

776
01:00:51,161 --> 01:00:54,129
Yeah. Yeah,
I thought you'd like it.

777
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:55,688
I do.

778
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:10,105
Let's never
leave here, James.

779
01:01:10,981 --> 01:01:13,549
- From this spot?
- Yeah.

780
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:18,053
From this spot.
Let's build our house here

781
01:01:18,054 --> 01:01:20,422
and raise our children
by this creek,

782
01:01:20,423 --> 01:01:22,333
grow old together.

783
01:01:24,361 --> 01:01:26,454
Okay.

784
01:01:26,496 --> 01:01:29,601
Can we wait till the morning?

785
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,194
Yes. I love you.

786
01:01:34,237 --> 01:01:35,912
I love you too.

787
01:01:47,283 --> 01:01:49,649
Am I too late?

788
01:01:53,456 --> 01:01:55,357
What...what are you
doing here, Will?

789
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:58,660
I asked you a question, Mary.
Am I too late?

790
01:01:58,661 --> 01:02:00,906
Will, leave us alone.

791
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:08,170
Once upon a time,
there was a little girl called Mary.

792
01:02:08,171 --> 01:02:10,439
And she could
have had a future.

793
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,341
She could have been...

794
01:02:12,342 --> 01:02:15,106
Mrs. Mayor Tunney

795
01:02:15,145 --> 01:02:17,012
because he loved her

796
01:02:17,013 --> 01:02:20,788
and he'd have
given her the world.

797
01:02:21,051 --> 01:02:23,246
But Mary,

798
01:02:23,286 --> 01:02:25,854
well, she had
a little lamb...

799
01:02:25,855 --> 01:02:27,982
a little lamb.

800
01:02:28,024 --> 01:02:29,582
Little lamb.

801
01:02:38,835 --> 01:02:41,336
Don't...Will!
Will, stop! Don't...

802
01:02:41,337 --> 01:02:45,732
So then the big bad wolf
came to town...

803
01:02:47,644 --> 01:02:49,612
and he huffed,

804
01:02:49,646 --> 01:02:52,342
and he puffed,

805
01:02:52,382 --> 01:02:56,752
- and he made her a widow.
- Don't! Will!

806
01:02:56,753 --> 01:02:59,688
- Will!
- He made her...

807
01:02:59,722 --> 01:03:01,356
Don't! Will, stop it!

808
01:03:01,357 --> 01:03:02,858
- ...A whore!
- Stop it!

809
01:03:02,859 --> 01:03:07,062
Just like he should
have done a long time ago.

810
01:03:07,063 --> 01:03:09,725
Will, no! No! Don't!

811
01:03:09,766 --> 01:03:12,633
Stop it!
Leave him alone!

812
01:03:12,669 --> 01:03:15,069
Stop it!

813
01:03:15,105 --> 01:03:18,110
Please please
please please!

814
01:03:24,647 --> 01:03:27,309
You say hello

815
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:29,585
to your daddy for me.

816
01:03:29,586 --> 01:03:31,487
- You want to save him?
- Yes.

817
01:03:31,488 --> 01:03:33,615
- Go.
- No!

818
01:03:36,459 --> 01:03:38,051
No!

819
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:42,455
No!

820
01:03:52,442 --> 01:03:54,774
Mary?

821
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:58,912
Ma... Mary?

822
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:04,015
You kill him... slow.

823
01:04:04,053 --> 01:04:06,522
You make him feel the pain.

824
01:04:06,523 --> 01:04:09,008
Make him feel the pain.

825
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,930
It's time,
bounty hunter.

826
01:04:33,283 --> 01:04:37,686
Oh no.
Oh no, Mary.

827
01:04:55,138 --> 01:04:58,335
He's dead now.

828
01:04:58,374 --> 01:05:01,400
Well, uh, sun's coming up.

829
01:05:03,613 --> 01:05:05,881
Sun's coming up, babe.

830
01:05:05,882 --> 01:05:08,510
You wake up.

831
01:05:08,551 --> 01:05:10,576
You sleep awhile.

832
01:05:14,123 --> 01:05:16,751
Yeah, you...

833
01:05:18,861 --> 01:05:23,016
He'll bleed a long
slow painful death.

834
01:05:27,203 --> 01:05:28,828
You sleep good.

835
01:06:02,972 --> 01:06:05,463
Miakoda.

836
01:06:05,508 --> 01:06:06,998
Miakoda!

837
01:09:03,352 --> 01:09:05,980
No!

838
01:09:06,022 --> 01:09:08,855
Stop it!

839
01:09:08,891 --> 01:09:10,415
No!

840
01:10:04,514 --> 01:10:06,581
- Whore! Whore!
- What's going on in there?

841
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:08,447
Leave me be.

842
01:10:08,484 --> 01:10:10,782
Come on, Velma.

843
01:10:13,155 --> 01:10:15,590
- Mary! Mary!
- It's all right. It's all right.

844
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:17,659
He... he wants
another bottle.

845
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:20,161
He's been drinking
for days.

846
01:10:20,162 --> 01:10:22,397
Don't look to me
for pity.

847
01:10:22,398 --> 01:10:24,525
Wait. Wait, Velma.

848
01:10:26,102 --> 01:10:28,127
Velma.

849
01:10:30,606 --> 01:10:33,598
Velma.

850
01:10:33,643 --> 01:10:35,270
Velma!

851
01:10:52,895 --> 01:10:55,235
Your fever has broken.

852
01:11:09,045 --> 01:11:10,535
You rest.

853
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:17,080
Mary.

854
01:11:20,089 --> 01:11:21,647
Where is she?

855
01:12:22,051 --> 01:12:23,541
I am Miakoda.

856
01:12:24,854 --> 01:12:26,651
I'm James.

857
01:12:26,689 --> 01:12:30,181
James. The bible
by King James.

858
01:12:30,226 --> 01:12:32,927
You speak English
very well.

859
01:12:32,928 --> 01:12:36,078
I learned
on the reservation.

860
01:12:40,302 --> 01:12:45,267
Life is not good there.
Many Navajo have died.

861
01:12:51,614 --> 01:12:54,624
That was you
who helped us.

862
01:12:56,419 --> 01:13:00,889
There were several others
that escaped as well.

863
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:02,824
Thank you.

864
01:13:05,194 --> 01:13:10,304
Your husband doesn't
seem to like me very much.

865
01:13:11,133 --> 01:13:13,234
Washakie is my brother.

866
01:13:13,235 --> 01:13:15,704
He is not trusting
of the white man.

867
01:13:15,705 --> 01:13:17,472
Our parents were killed

868
01:13:17,473 --> 01:13:19,839
at our home in Tsegi

869
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:22,036
by your Kit Carson.

870
01:13:23,312 --> 01:13:28,550
I'm trying to forgive them
for what they have done.

871
01:13:28,551 --> 01:13:30,585
"Turn the other cheek"

872
01:13:30,586 --> 01:13:32,577
as your god says.

873
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:35,112
I've tried that.

874
01:13:36,392 --> 01:13:38,162
It doesn't work.

875
01:13:42,865 --> 01:13:46,925
- You are still weak.
- I'll be fine.

876
01:13:55,377 --> 01:13:57,147
What did he say?

877
01:13:58,948 --> 01:14:02,768
I said you are
foolish white man...

878
01:14:02,918 --> 01:14:06,788
and we should have
left you to die.

879
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:28,843
What's going on?

880
01:14:28,844 --> 01:14:32,139
Hey, boss.
How're you feeling?

881
01:14:32,581 --> 01:14:35,161
I asked you
a question.

882
01:14:44,226 --> 01:14:47,061
We haven't been able
to find Garrick.

883
01:14:47,062 --> 01:14:49,895
And, uh, all the deeds

884
01:14:49,932 --> 01:14:52,033
have been given back
to their original owners,

885
01:14:52,034 --> 01:14:53,768
So I'd say
we're pretty much, uh...

886
01:14:53,769 --> 01:14:58,019
Do not even dare
to venture an opinion.

887
01:14:58,107 --> 01:14:59,641
Okay, sorry, boss.

888
01:14:59,642 --> 01:15:01,269
Yeah, well...

889
01:15:02,311 --> 01:15:04,802
Pacific Railroad...

890
01:15:06,215 --> 01:15:08,349
and them bigwigs
coming into town

891
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:10,351
to do their dog
and pony show,

892
01:15:10,352 --> 01:15:14,747
we're gonna need
to get them deeds back.

893
01:15:14,757 --> 01:15:17,097
From everyone in town?

894
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:25,371
Does that answer
your question?

895
01:15:31,607 --> 01:15:33,908
We're gonna need more men.

896
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:35,570
How many?

897
01:15:35,611 --> 01:15:39,191
Many cockroaches
as you can find.

898
01:15:39,281 --> 01:15:40,949
Turn over every rock
in this town.

899
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:43,441
Yes, sir.

900
01:15:43,485 --> 01:15:45,419
I have decided

901
01:15:46,922 --> 01:15:49,117
that this town

902
01:15:49,158 --> 01:15:51,926
and the people in it
do not deserve

903
01:15:51,927 --> 01:15:55,272
what I am gonna
bring to them!

904
01:16:00,903 --> 01:16:04,361
Anyway, I'm gonna...

905
01:16:04,406 --> 01:16:07,068
uh, clean up.

906
01:16:07,109 --> 01:16:12,364
You'd better hope I'm
in a better mood tomorrow.

907
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:47,680
She was beautiful,

908
01:16:47,716 --> 01:16:49,961
the woman who passed.

909
01:16:51,353 --> 01:16:53,480
She was my wife.

910
01:16:55,824 --> 01:16:57,792
I am sorry.

911
01:17:00,262 --> 01:17:03,598
There are wonderful things
in your God's book about death

912
01:17:03,599 --> 01:17:07,324
that are like
my people's beliefs.

913
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:09,469
I'm sorry,

914
01:17:09,505 --> 01:17:13,074
but I'm all out of beliefs
for one lifetime.

915
01:17:13,075 --> 01:17:16,800
We have all suffered
a great loss.

916
01:17:17,012 --> 01:17:20,248
But it is the valleys
that we learn from...

917
01:17:20,249 --> 01:17:22,683
and not the hills.

918
01:17:22,718 --> 01:17:25,628
Sounds like poetry, Miakoda.

919
01:17:26,989 --> 01:17:28,957
When I hold this ribbon
in my hand,

920
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:32,060
all I see
is blackness in my heart.

921
01:17:32,061 --> 01:17:35,071
It is not blackness you see.

922
01:17:36,131 --> 01:17:38,331
It is only a shadow.

923
01:17:52,448 --> 01:17:54,315
You saved my life.

924
01:17:54,316 --> 01:17:55,883
We saved each other's.

925
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:57,613
I am grateful.

926
01:17:57,653 --> 01:18:01,333
It was you who
gave us the knife.

927
01:18:07,229 --> 01:18:08,963
It is an old
Navajo saying.

928
01:18:08,964 --> 01:18:10,665
It means he who
saves a life

929
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:13,134
shares his debt
with those he saves.

930
01:18:13,135 --> 01:18:15,236
Well, that doesn't
sound too bad.

931
01:18:15,237 --> 01:18:17,137
It is for him.

932
01:18:17,172 --> 01:18:21,275
You'll do what is right
for your heart.

933
01:18:21,276 --> 01:18:22,903
I know.

934
01:18:23,946 --> 01:18:25,743
Goodbye, Miakoda.

935
01:21:44,246 --> 01:21:46,976
Hey hey... wha... wha...

936
01:21:47,015 --> 01:21:48,949
It's me.

937
01:21:48,984 --> 01:21:51,646
How'd you two
get away?

938
01:21:51,687 --> 01:21:53,518
Where's Mary?

939
01:21:57,593 --> 01:21:59,126
Huh-uh. No. No.

940
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:01,757
Look at me.
Look at me.

941
01:22:02,264 --> 01:22:03,731
Look at me.

942
01:22:03,765 --> 01:22:06,725
- Mary, no.
- It ends here.

943
01:22:08,203 --> 01:22:10,828
Okay. Wait.
Wait. James.

944
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,170
Hello there.

945
01:22:20,215 --> 01:22:22,583
- Hi.
- Come on, Penny.

946
01:22:22,584 --> 01:22:26,187
- What, Mother?
- Not yet, all right? Just wait.

947
01:22:26,188 --> 01:22:29,008
Come on.
I know, come on!

948
01:22:32,694 --> 01:22:35,096
You need to cover
yourself up, James. Here's a coat.

949
01:22:35,097 --> 01:22:37,765
- Where's your horse at?
- Out behind the general store.

950
01:22:37,766 --> 01:22:39,533
We can reach the marshal
up in Jamison.

951
01:22:39,534 --> 01:22:42,637
Maybe by tomorrow morning,
but we gotta leave right now.

952
01:22:42,638 --> 01:22:44,739
I'm not going anywhere.

953
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:50,740
What are you gonna do?
You gonna take them all on by yourself?

954
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,249
Sheriff Sanders is dead;
his deputies dead.

955
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:57,616
Will killed them all.

956
01:22:57,653 --> 01:23:00,154
Without the law,
Tunney and his men,

957
01:23:00,155 --> 01:23:01,889
they control
the whole damn town.

958
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:03,517
Not for long.

959
01:23:05,927 --> 01:23:07,918
Hey. Hey!

960
01:23:10,499 --> 01:23:12,867
You promised my sister.

961
01:23:12,868 --> 01:23:14,836
What?

962
01:23:18,106 --> 01:23:21,261
I told her
not to marry you.

963
01:23:21,643 --> 01:23:23,804
What did you say?

964
01:23:23,845 --> 01:23:27,955
I told her she'd
be making a mistake.

965
01:23:29,818 --> 01:23:32,219
You ain't the same
person we once knew.

966
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:35,222
I told her you ain't a man
who settles down to a family.

967
01:23:35,223 --> 01:23:38,021
She said I was wrong.

968
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:41,062
She said that you'd changed
your old desperate ways.

969
01:23:41,063 --> 01:23:44,031
She said that
you promised her,

970
01:23:44,032 --> 01:23:46,087
and I believed her.

971
01:23:48,236 --> 01:23:50,071
Listen to me, James.

972
01:23:50,072 --> 01:23:53,074
If you go against everything
that Mary believed in

973
01:23:53,075 --> 01:23:56,944
and you get yourself
killed doing it,

974
01:23:56,945 --> 01:24:00,581
well, then you destroy
any chance you have

975
01:24:00,582 --> 01:24:03,851
of being together
at your end.

976
01:24:03,852 --> 01:24:05,812
I'm sorry, Johnny.

977
01:24:07,589 --> 01:24:10,925
Well, hold up. Conners, all right,
I'll make a deal with you.

978
01:24:10,926 --> 01:24:13,427
Just... just ride
with me to Jamison.

979
01:24:13,428 --> 01:24:15,596
We'll talk to the marshal.

980
01:24:15,597 --> 01:24:20,852
And if he don't agree
to take in Tunney, then...

981
01:24:25,207 --> 01:24:29,027
well, we'll take him
down together.

982
01:24:31,113 --> 01:24:34,276
All of them. I promise.

983
01:24:53,602 --> 01:24:56,093
Finch!

984
01:24:56,138 --> 01:24:59,103
- Let's go!
- It can't be.

985
01:25:00,175 --> 01:25:01,608
Yeah?

986
01:25:01,643 --> 01:25:05,128
Hey, boss!
James is still alive.

987
01:25:11,453 --> 01:25:14,893
You want to repeat
that for me?

988
01:25:17,058 --> 01:25:19,393
Him and, uh,
Mary's brother

989
01:25:19,394 --> 01:25:23,431
rode out of town,
and they were in a heck of a hurry.

990
01:25:23,432 --> 01:25:25,297
Well...

991
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:28,736
they're heading
for Jamison to get the marshal.

992
01:25:28,737 --> 01:25:32,322
Why don't you go
get them first?

993
01:25:32,607 --> 01:25:34,662
And find me Spider.

994
01:25:54,763 --> 01:25:58,631
Hey! Hey! Whoa!

995
01:26:01,203 --> 01:26:03,404
We need
to rest them some.

996
01:26:03,405 --> 01:26:06,140
And we need a place
to bed come nightfall.

997
01:26:06,141 --> 01:26:08,405
Got any suggestions?

998
01:26:08,443 --> 01:26:13,603
I ain't never been
out of town this far before.

999
01:26:13,782 --> 01:26:15,545
Fine.

1000
01:26:15,584 --> 01:26:17,779
Come on, Ruby.

1001
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:45,075
James, what are
you doing?

1002
01:26:46,982 --> 01:26:50,351
What's she doing?
Hey, did you see Mary's horse over here?

1003
01:26:50,352 --> 01:26:53,187
No no no no no no!
Washakie, Washakie, he's my friend!

1004
01:26:53,188 --> 01:26:56,290
- Washakie!
- Please, let him go.

1005
01:26:56,291 --> 01:26:59,193
You know this savage?
No! Ow!

1006
01:26:59,194 --> 01:27:01,862
He didn't mean that.
He didn't mean that. Apologize!

1007
01:27:01,863 --> 01:27:05,162
Are you serious?

1008
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:09,003
- He understands English.
- For whatever I said, I'm sorry!

1009
01:27:09,004 --> 01:27:11,871
See?
Washakie, he's sorry.

1010
01:27:11,907 --> 01:27:16,062
Please please,
let him go. Let him go.

1011
01:27:16,177 --> 01:27:18,338
Ow!

1012
01:27:27,122 --> 01:27:29,488
What did I say?

1013
01:27:30,525 --> 01:27:31,960
Howdy, ma'am.

1014
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:41,135
Mm.

1015
01:27:41,169 --> 01:27:45,372
This is some pretty
amazing stew there, Mia...

1016
01:27:45,373 --> 01:27:46,707
Uh, Mida? Mayday...

1017
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:48,107
Miakoda.

1018
01:27:48,143 --> 01:27:50,134
Miakoda.

1019
01:27:52,547 --> 01:27:55,349
Miakoda. Hm, that's...
that's a pretty name.

1020
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:58,185
If you head straight,
you will come to a creek.

1021
01:27:58,186 --> 01:28:01,087
Once you pass twin rocks,

1022
01:28:01,122 --> 01:28:06,852
follow it to Jamison.
The moon will show you the way.

1023
01:28:06,928 --> 01:28:09,697
- They should stay the night.
- No.

1024
01:28:09,698 --> 01:28:14,468
It is dangerous for all of us
if they do not keep moving.

1025
01:28:14,469 --> 01:28:16,733
He's right.

1026
01:28:16,771 --> 01:28:19,061
Thanks again, Miakoda.

1027
01:28:33,989 --> 01:28:36,757
I'll come back here
after I see the marshal.

1028
01:28:36,758 --> 01:28:42,429
It is time for us to move on.
We will be gone by then.

1029
01:28:42,430 --> 01:28:43,897
Here.

1030
01:28:43,932 --> 01:28:45,524
You keep it.

1031
01:28:53,141 --> 01:28:55,275
You are doing the right thing.

1032
01:28:55,276 --> 01:28:57,904
Mia... koda?

1033
01:28:57,946 --> 01:28:59,504
Miakoda?

1034
01:29:00,915 --> 01:29:04,585
Thanks again for that stew.
It really hit the spot.

1035
01:29:04,586 --> 01:29:08,886
And, uh, thanks to both
of y'all for...

1036
01:29:14,329 --> 01:29:17,594
Johnny! Johnny!

1037
01:29:29,477 --> 01:29:31,138
We got 'em.

1038
01:29:32,847 --> 01:29:35,577
James, don't go! Don't!

1039
01:29:35,617 --> 01:29:37,244
Stay here.

1040
01:29:39,187 --> 01:29:41,789
Hey hey hey hey hey!
Stay with Miakoda.

1041
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:43,290
She will be fine.

1042
01:29:43,291 --> 01:29:44,858
This is not your fight.

1043
01:29:44,859 --> 01:29:48,154
Your fights
are now my fights.

1044
01:29:59,641 --> 01:30:02,776
- Where are they, Finch?
- Shh.

1045
01:30:02,777 --> 01:30:06,547
- Finch, where are they?
- Shut up.

1046
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:12,684
Finch? Finch!

1047
01:31:00,435 --> 01:31:02,236
We took care
of Mary's brother,

1048
01:31:02,237 --> 01:31:04,738
but, uh, Charlie
got killed.

1049
01:31:04,739 --> 01:31:09,084
Well, I am deeply
saddened by that news.

1050
01:31:11,079 --> 01:31:14,348
Where's the body?
I want to see James's body.

1051
01:31:14,349 --> 01:31:18,685
Had to leave him there.
But I... I scared off his horse.

1052
01:31:18,686 --> 01:31:20,153
Yeah, well,

1053
01:31:20,188 --> 01:31:23,490
he won't be needing
that horse no more, will he?

1054
01:31:23,491 --> 01:31:25,793
What I'm trying to say is
James is still alive.

1055
01:31:25,794 --> 01:31:28,061
He had this Injun with him.

1056
01:31:28,062 --> 01:31:32,328
- That's who killed Charlie.
- He what?

1057
01:31:32,367 --> 01:31:35,435
He had this Injun with him,
and that's who killed Charlie.

1058
01:31:35,436 --> 01:31:37,876
So I had to leave him.

1059
01:31:40,408 --> 01:31:44,077
How many men you got
rustled up for this meeting?

1060
01:31:44,078 --> 01:31:46,842
Should be half dozen.

1061
01:31:46,881 --> 01:31:49,650
Yeah, Spider
counts as six.

1062
01:31:49,651 --> 01:31:54,521
Okay, we'll go after James
after the meeting.

1063
01:31:56,257 --> 01:31:58,502
Where are the people?

1064
01:32:01,563 --> 01:32:03,258
Shh shh.

1065
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,821
They must all be
in the church.

1066
01:32:27,822 --> 01:32:29,456
What's your plan?

1067
01:32:29,457 --> 01:32:35,195
We go on in there to take down
the man who murdered my wife.

1068
01:32:35,196 --> 01:32:37,731
I'm not used
to being the hunter.

1069
01:32:37,732 --> 01:32:40,312
Usually I am the hunted.

1070
01:32:41,536 --> 01:32:44,786
That is why
I like this plan.

1071
01:32:46,808 --> 01:32:49,543
Evening, fine folks
of Legend.

1072
01:32:49,544 --> 01:32:52,274
I am T.S. McKinley,

1073
01:32:52,313 --> 01:32:56,350
the Pacific-West representative
for the Pacific Railroad.

1074
01:32:56,351 --> 01:32:58,218
Thank you, thank you.

1075
01:32:58,219 --> 01:33:00,187
As you know,
the Pacific Railroad

1076
01:33:00,188 --> 01:33:01,655
is laying tracks
in this area,

1077
01:33:01,656 --> 01:33:06,526
which will make Legend
one of its many stops.

1078
01:33:07,562 --> 01:33:11,164
Uh, that means that there will
be a whole lot of new people

1079
01:33:11,165 --> 01:33:15,315
and products coming
to your businesses.

1080
01:33:18,973 --> 01:33:21,975
- Furthermore...
- Beg your pardon, sir.

1081
01:33:21,976 --> 01:33:24,171
Yes, sir?

1082
01:33:24,212 --> 01:33:26,313
This is the first
we've heard of the railroad.

1083
01:33:26,314 --> 01:33:29,283
Yeah!

1084
01:33:29,317 --> 01:33:32,684
Well, th...
that's impossible.

1085
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:35,280
We sent word months ago

1086
01:33:35,323 --> 01:33:37,190
with several updates.

1087
01:33:37,191 --> 01:33:39,192
To who? We didn't
hear about it.

1088
01:33:39,193 --> 01:33:41,184
That's right!

1089
01:33:41,229 --> 01:33:47,167
Now now, calm down. Calm down.
We sent them to your mayor's office.

1090
01:33:47,168 --> 01:33:51,943
All right, we gotta
take out these two guys.

1091
01:33:59,247 --> 01:34:01,481
Where are they going?

1092
01:34:01,482 --> 01:34:04,918
- Miakoda!
- What is she doing?

1093
01:34:06,054 --> 01:34:07,521
Let's go.

1094
01:34:07,555 --> 01:34:09,580
Hey there.

1095
01:34:11,426 --> 01:34:14,261
Lose your way off
the reservation camp?

1096
01:34:14,262 --> 01:34:16,830
My partner's talking
to you, lndian girl.

1097
01:34:16,831 --> 01:34:21,635
She doesn't understand
a word we're saying, do you?

1098
01:34:21,636 --> 01:34:25,411
Man, oh man,
you are a pretty one.

1099
01:34:25,506 --> 01:34:27,574
I'm looking for a light-haired
man named James.

1100
01:34:27,575 --> 01:34:30,944
Well, look at that.
She can talk.

1101
01:34:30,945 --> 01:34:32,512
Can you tell me
where to find him?

1102
01:34:32,513 --> 01:34:36,583
Sure. Climb off and I'll
take you right to him.

1103
01:34:36,584 --> 01:34:38,952
You can handle things
while the little redskin and I

1104
01:34:38,953 --> 01:34:41,254
go look for her friend?

1105
01:34:41,255 --> 01:34:44,157
Now my lawyer
and political adviser

1106
01:34:44,158 --> 01:34:47,794
Mr. Garrick Haring
advised me to buy land.

1107
01:34:47,795 --> 01:34:50,831
Like everyone else
in this town, I am also a businessman...

1108
01:34:50,832 --> 01:34:53,300
And a thief!

1109
01:34:53,334 --> 01:34:55,335
Is that true, Mayor?

1110
01:34:55,336 --> 01:34:58,572
Well, now obviously
Mr. Garrick Haring

1111
01:34:58,573 --> 01:35:01,074
was keeping
the information, uh,

1112
01:35:01,075 --> 01:35:02,909
of a railroad deal
to himself,

1113
01:35:02,910 --> 01:35:05,412
and benefiting from
my personal investments,

1114
01:35:05,413 --> 01:35:07,981
of which he was to make
a very generous 50%

1115
01:35:07,982 --> 01:35:11,577
However, I was
falsely arrested,

1116
01:35:11,619 --> 01:35:14,721
thrown in jail, Mr. Garrick Haring
was run out of town,

1117
01:35:14,722 --> 01:35:18,959
and these townsfolk have
reneged on these contracts

1118
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:22,295
which you all signed,
handing over your properties to me.

1119
01:35:22,296 --> 01:35:25,261
I now own your land by law.

1120
01:35:26,134 --> 01:35:27,667
I get her
when you're done.

1121
01:35:27,668 --> 01:35:30,438
If there's
anything left.

1122
01:35:38,379 --> 01:35:42,579
You should not
have come here, Miakoda!

1123
01:35:43,184 --> 01:35:44,818
This is wrong, Washakie,
and you know it.

1124
01:35:44,819 --> 01:35:46,853
This is his destiny.

1125
01:35:46,854 --> 01:35:48,655
You mustn't do this.

1126
01:35:48,656 --> 01:35:51,825
James, if you do this,
you will have nothing!

1127
01:35:51,826 --> 01:35:53,527
Washakie, get her
out of here.

1128
01:35:53,528 --> 01:35:56,296
I will not run or hide
from my beliefs.

1129
01:35:56,297 --> 01:35:59,067
Then that's your decision.

1130
01:36:04,072 --> 01:36:06,127
You will stay here.

1131
01:36:08,543 --> 01:36:10,744
We were forced to sell
our land to the mayor!

1132
01:36:10,745 --> 01:36:12,007
Yeah! Yeah!

1133
01:36:12,046 --> 01:36:14,815
Why don't you sell us
the land back?

1134
01:36:14,816 --> 01:36:17,551
Well, my friend,
I would like to help you out,

1135
01:36:17,552 --> 01:36:19,419
from the bottom
of my heart.

1136
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:22,222
But I only own
50% of your properties.

1137
01:36:22,223 --> 01:36:24,791
And I never
go back on a deal.

1138
01:36:24,792 --> 01:36:26,419
What deal?

1139
01:36:26,461 --> 01:36:28,195
However, you may
rest assured

1140
01:36:28,196 --> 01:36:30,097
that your businesses
are gonna prosper

1141
01:36:30,098 --> 01:36:32,365
because of all
of this new currency

1142
01:36:32,366 --> 01:36:34,768
which is a-rolling in
from out there...

1143
01:36:34,769 --> 01:36:37,304
- through Legend.
- To your pockets!

1144
01:36:37,305 --> 01:36:40,240
Not if you overcharge
us for that land!

1145
01:36:40,241 --> 01:36:44,778
- That's right!
- Well, I don't see that happening

1146
01:36:44,779 --> 01:36:47,499
in the foreseeable future.

1147
01:36:52,286 --> 01:36:54,811
All right, break it up!

1148
01:37:00,261 --> 01:37:02,388
Sorry, folks.

1149
01:37:02,430 --> 01:37:06,766
Just want to say support
our mayor 100%.

1150
01:37:06,767 --> 01:37:08,301
Why, thank you, Spider.

1151
01:37:08,302 --> 01:37:10,103
Uh, as you can see,
Mr. McKinley,

1152
01:37:10,104 --> 01:37:12,372
we are all very excited
about the prospect

1153
01:37:12,373 --> 01:37:14,608
of a railroad coming
through Legend.

1154
01:37:14,609 --> 01:37:17,978
And we look forward to Legend
being your favorite stop.

1155
01:37:17,979 --> 01:37:20,347
In fact, you are now
standing in what will be

1156
01:37:20,348 --> 01:37:22,115
Legend's railroad depot.

1157
01:37:22,116 --> 01:37:24,384
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1158
01:37:24,385 --> 01:37:27,287
I am going to go
to the saloon

1159
01:37:27,288 --> 01:37:30,757
and get drunk, and celebrate
this momentous occasion.

1160
01:37:30,758 --> 01:37:34,592
If anybody would care to join me?

1161
01:37:34,629 --> 01:37:37,734
Please, the drinks are on me.

1162
01:37:38,966 --> 01:37:41,786
For half an hour at least.

1163
01:37:45,072 --> 01:37:46,697
I remember you.

1164
01:37:47,608 --> 01:37:49,409
Let's raise hell!

1165
01:37:49,410 --> 01:37:51,511
Yeah! All right!
We need a bottle!

1166
01:37:51,512 --> 01:37:53,480
Where is everybody?

1167
01:37:53,481 --> 01:37:56,416
Phil and Bob, customers!

1168
01:37:56,450 --> 01:37:58,685
Where the hell
is my piano player?

1169
01:37:58,686 --> 01:38:00,420
I didn't give nobody
the night off.

1170
01:38:00,421 --> 01:38:04,084
Velma! Velma!

1171
01:38:04,125 --> 01:38:07,800
Get your
daddy longlegs down here!

1172
01:38:11,799 --> 01:38:13,867
There was supposed to be
six men with us.

1173
01:38:13,868 --> 01:38:16,336
One, two, three, four
was obviously enough,

1174
01:38:16,337 --> 01:38:18,438
- with Spider.
- Yeah, where is Spider?

1175
01:38:18,439 --> 01:38:21,494
Spider... Spider don't drink.

1176
01:38:22,043 --> 01:38:24,375
Finch, whiskey, now!

1177
01:38:24,412 --> 01:38:28,181
Make sure it ain't that
watered-down public swill.

1178
01:38:28,182 --> 01:38:31,477
Come on.
I feel lucky tonight.

1179
01:38:32,887 --> 01:38:37,952
Yes, sir, which one of you
is new to the game?

1180
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:39,854
Oh, yeah.

1181
01:38:39,894 --> 01:38:42,761
Will.

1182
01:38:42,797 --> 01:38:44,458
Yes, sir.

1183
01:38:44,498 --> 01:38:46,989
- Will!
- What?

1184
01:39:27,408 --> 01:39:29,033
Get up, Tunney!

1185
01:39:32,913 --> 01:39:35,348
That sure was exciting.

1186
01:39:36,484 --> 01:39:39,953
Dang, you've gone
and shot all my men.

1187
01:39:39,954 --> 01:39:42,869
And I had the winning hand.

1188
01:39:43,257 --> 01:39:48,194
I sure done raised hell
when I killed your pappy, boy.

1189
01:39:48,195 --> 01:39:51,495
Why won't you
just let me be?

1190
01:39:54,635 --> 01:39:57,537
I'll tell you what...
you name your price,

1191
01:39:57,538 --> 01:39:59,773
anything you want
in the world, it's yours.

1192
01:39:59,774 --> 01:40:01,639
Just name it.

1193
01:40:01,676 --> 01:40:04,477
- I only want one thing.
- Anything.

1194
01:40:04,478 --> 01:40:06,639
I want Mary back.

1195
01:40:08,282 --> 01:40:10,648
Will she do?

1196
01:40:13,287 --> 01:40:15,881
She'll do. Yes, sir.

1197
01:40:15,923 --> 01:40:19,120
Nice and easy.

1198
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:21,828
I'm just gonna
take my coat here,

1199
01:40:21,829 --> 01:40:25,598
catch me a breath
of fresh air, right outside.

1200
01:40:25,599 --> 01:40:28,159
Nice and easy does it.

1201
01:40:30,037 --> 01:40:34,407
Spider, if I weren't so cheap,
I'd give you a raise.

1202
01:40:34,408 --> 01:40:36,276
Well, what have we here?

1203
01:40:36,277 --> 01:40:38,572
Huh? I don't normally

1204
01:40:38,579 --> 01:40:40,513
get requests for redskins,

1205
01:40:40,514 --> 01:40:42,582
but my own personal tastes,

1206
01:40:42,583 --> 01:40:45,780
oh, they run wild

1207
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:48,983
like the west wind. Mm.

1208
01:40:56,097 --> 01:40:58,588
Easy does it.

1209
01:40:58,632 --> 01:41:01,032
Okay.

1210
01:41:01,068 --> 01:41:03,263
Spider...

1211
01:41:03,304 --> 01:41:06,873
I want you to give me
a good head start here.

1212
01:41:06,874 --> 01:41:09,175
We're not going
anywhere.

1213
01:41:09,176 --> 01:41:11,701
Well... adios.

1214
01:41:32,066 --> 01:41:35,551
Okay, Chief.
No more Injun talk.

1215
01:41:38,038 --> 01:41:39,972
Chief?

1216
01:41:40,007 --> 01:41:41,804
Shh.

1217
01:41:47,548 --> 01:41:49,607
Here we go.

1218
01:41:54,221 --> 01:41:57,657
- That was not nice.
- Hyaa!

1219
01:42:19,613 --> 01:42:21,513
Washakie!

1220
01:42:23,651 --> 01:42:25,482
Washakie!

1221
01:42:25,519 --> 01:42:28,545
I will be fine.

1222
01:42:28,589 --> 01:42:31,224
- Washakie.
- What you do now

1223
01:42:31,225 --> 01:42:33,950
must be done on your own.

1224
01:42:35,229 --> 01:42:38,824
Only friendship,
my brother.

1225
01:42:43,737 --> 01:42:45,227
James!

1226
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:15,001
I've been looking
all over for you!

1227
01:43:15,002 --> 01:43:17,266
James!

1228
01:43:17,304 --> 01:43:19,272
Bye, James.

1229
01:43:23,277 --> 01:43:25,445
Your mother,
God rest her soul,

1230
01:43:25,446 --> 01:43:28,414
- would be very proud of you, boy.
- Yes, Father.

1231
01:43:28,415 --> 01:43:31,251
Remember what I taught you.
Forgive men their sins,

1232
01:43:31,252 --> 01:43:35,547
and the Almighty
will forgive you yours.

1233
01:43:41,362 --> 01:43:43,091
Come on, boy!

1234
01:43:43,130 --> 01:43:45,155
Whoo-hoo!

1235
01:43:45,199 --> 01:43:47,367
That was a lucky shot.

1236
01:43:47,368 --> 01:43:52,338
So! Still ain't got
the guts to kill me, huh?

1237
01:43:52,907 --> 01:43:54,541
This ain't your town
no more, boy.

1238
01:43:54,542 --> 01:43:56,643
This is my town now.

1239
01:43:56,644 --> 01:44:00,213
What the hell are you
still doing here?

1240
01:44:00,214 --> 01:44:03,581
Your daddy, your wife,

1241
01:44:03,617 --> 01:44:07,627
your daddy's church...
they all gone.

1242
01:44:08,455 --> 01:44:10,355
This is my town.

1243
01:44:10,391 --> 01:44:13,292
It's my future.

1244
01:44:13,327 --> 01:44:15,852
Yeah!

1245
01:44:15,896 --> 01:44:21,101
I am the decider here,
and you are history, boy.

1246
01:44:22,102 --> 01:44:24,003
What was it your daddy

1247
01:44:24,004 --> 01:44:26,919
said to you before he died?

1248
01:44:27,741 --> 01:44:29,709
He said...

1249
01:44:30,878 --> 01:44:32,979
"Forgive men their sins

1250
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:36,882
that He may
forgive you yours."

1251
01:44:36,917 --> 01:44:39,352
Now, tell me something,

1252
01:44:39,386 --> 01:44:44,016
can you find a little
forgiveness for me...

1253
01:44:44,892 --> 01:44:47,520
in your heart,

1254
01:44:47,561 --> 01:44:51,146
before I blow
a hole in it? Hmm?

1255
01:44:53,167 --> 01:44:55,902
You look at me, boy.
Look at me.

1256
01:44:55,903 --> 01:44:57,937
You look deep in my eyes

1257
01:44:57,938 --> 01:44:59,993
with all that hate.

1258
01:45:00,007 --> 01:45:01,565
Yeah.

1259
01:45:01,609 --> 01:45:04,764
You can't hide
from me, boy.

1260
01:45:07,147 --> 01:45:09,342
Come on, do it!

1261
01:45:09,383 --> 01:45:11,451
I know you got it there.

1262
01:45:11,452 --> 01:45:13,352
Bring it on, boy.

1263
01:45:13,387 --> 01:45:15,116
Yeah!

1264
01:45:19,193 --> 01:45:21,823
You can't
kill me, boy.

1265
01:45:22,262 --> 01:45:25,365
You just can't kill me.
You want to know why?

1266
01:45:25,366 --> 01:45:26,856
Huh?

1267
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:29,575
Well, your daddy said it.

1268
01:45:30,270 --> 01:45:33,569
He said to you, killing me,

1269
01:45:33,607 --> 01:45:37,343
that don't make you
any better than me.

1270
01:45:37,344 --> 01:45:39,471
You understand?

1271
01:45:39,513 --> 01:45:43,583
You don't want to disappoint
your daddy, do you?

1272
01:45:43,584 --> 01:45:47,884
You don't want to fail
our lovely Mary?

1273
01:45:48,689 --> 01:45:52,844
You want to see them
in heaven, right?

1274
01:45:54,528 --> 01:45:58,208
Or you want to walk
down my path?

1275
01:45:58,399 --> 01:46:00,458
No.

1276
01:46:00,501 --> 01:46:03,163
No, you don't.

1277
01:46:03,203 --> 01:46:06,258
Better say your prayers, boy.

1278
01:46:06,907 --> 01:46:09,102
What the...

1279
01:46:15,349 --> 01:46:17,214
I guess I failed.
