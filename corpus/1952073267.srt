1
00:00:00,976 --> 00:00:03,811
(rain falling)

2
00:00:09,351 --> 00:00:12,587
(siren wailing in distance)

3
00:00:12,655 --> 00:00:14,989
(thunder crashing)

4
00:00:21,864 --> 00:00:24,198
(thunder crashes)

5
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:38,880
Thank you.

6
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:42,216
(groans)

7
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,893
How long she
gonna be there?

8
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:53,962
Well, the wife's mother,

9
00:00:54,029 --> 00:00:57,031
she's taking longer
to die than we thought.

10
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,633
You said she never liked you.

11
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:00,301
No. I said

12
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:02,437
she thought I was
the wrong guy.

13
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:03,705
Boy, that's good coffee.

14
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,340
Maybe not <i>quite</i> as good

15
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:07,842
as a macchiato after
carbonara at Adriano's.

16
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,112
But, uh, certainly good coffee
for fast-food coffee.

17
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,114
What's the name
of this place again?

18
00:01:13,182 --> 00:01:14,482
Franco's.

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,218
Franco's.

20
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,787
I didn't think
the State Homicide Commander

21
00:01:19,855 --> 00:01:21,356
- did stakeouts.
- It's not a stakeout.

22
00:01:21,423 --> 00:01:22,557
It feels like
a stakeout.

23
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,692
No, I just want to see
how long this guy's

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,860
gonna stay in there.

25
00:01:25,928 --> 00:01:28,162
- Because...?
- Because

26
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,032
I didn't think he'd
stay in there this long.

27
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,668
Franco's had pizza--
should I go back?

28
00:01:33,736 --> 00:01:36,271
I told you we had
to make a stop.

29
00:01:36,338 --> 00:01:37,405
You did.

30
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:40,208
We'll have dinner at Adriano's.

31
00:01:40,276 --> 00:01:42,176
Tonight?

32
00:01:42,244 --> 00:01:43,678
Tonight.

33
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:44,746
Okay?

34
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,749
(gunshots)

35
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,618
(gunshots ricocheting)

36
00:01:53,422 --> 00:01:55,590
(last gunshot echoes)

37
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:05,600
# #

38
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:12,674
(windshield wipers
whooshing rhythmically)

39
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:42,904
(gunshot)

40
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:44,038
(gunshot)

41
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,484
# #

42
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:02,890
(woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

43
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:18,539
We've managed to stabilize him.

44
00:03:18,607 --> 00:03:21,009
If he makes it, we'll
have to open him up again

45
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,844
when he's stronger.

46
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,046
That's all we know.

47
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:36,724
(sighs)

48
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,459
You're a member of Mr. Healy's
immediate family?

49
00:04:00,494 --> 00:04:01,642
It's <i>Captain</i> Healy,

50
00:04:01,677 --> 00:04:03,822
and no, I'm not, and
his wife is in Seattle.

51
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:05,053
Someone has to sign
for his valuables--

52
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,554
his badge, his gun.

53
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:09,206
- I'll take them.
- You a fellow officer?

54
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:09,949
Yes.

55
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:11,225
Can I see your badge?

56
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,927
It's in a drawer.

57
00:04:12,995 --> 00:04:15,330
You were with him?

58
00:04:15,397 --> 00:04:17,665
Yes.

59
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,701
That his blood on you?

60
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,971
Some of it.

61
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,908
I'll get them.

62
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:45,593
(seabirds crying)

63
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,545
(door opens)

64
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:06,147
Morning.

65
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:08,716
She's interviewing

66
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:09,784
the candidate, Lou.

67
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:12,053
I'm Jesse.

68
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:13,521
I know.

69
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:14,722
You keep calling me Lou,
Suitcase,

70
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,324
I'm going to call you Luther.

71
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:18,192
Why would I call you Lou, Jesse?

72
00:05:20,462 --> 00:05:21,996
Sorry I'm late.

73
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:23,965
Chief Stone,
William Butler.

74
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,900
Nice to meet you.

75
00:05:25,968 --> 00:05:27,468
Oh, Rose, I didn't mean
to interrupt.

76
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,870
Yeah, we were up

77
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:31,139
to the Boston PD,
which you left in...

78
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,340
Uh, May 2002.

79
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:34,442
At which point I
moved to Springfield

80
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,578
and joined
the force there.

81
00:05:36,645 --> 00:05:39,013
I was the CJIS, uh, liaison
to the staties.

82
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:42,684
What is CJIS liaison
to the staties?

83
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:44,953
Criminal Justice
Information Services.

84
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,487
Computers?

85
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,590
Yes, but I want to get back
to hands-on policing.

86
00:05:48,657 --> 00:05:50,692
Well, we're hands-on here.

87
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,361
(sighs) I guess...
I guess that's all,

88
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:54,829
unless you have
anything, Jesse.

89
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:56,598
I do.

90
00:05:56,665 --> 00:05:59,167
Did you leave your last two
jobs, or were you let go?

91
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:01,603
I beg your pardon?

92
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,371
You didn't hear me?

93
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:06,441
I heard you.

94
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:08,376
I left.

95
00:06:08,444 --> 00:06:10,144
Thank you very much,

96
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:11,746
Mr. Butler.
It was a pleasure.

97
00:06:11,814 --> 00:06:12,880
We'll let
you know.

98
00:06:18,887 --> 00:06:20,121
Where were you?

99
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:21,956
I got stuck
in traffic.

100
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:23,057
From your house?

101
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,026
No, from Boston.

102
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:27,395
What did you think?

103
00:06:27,463 --> 00:06:28,896
Well, he has a very
impressive résumé.

104
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:30,498
- I don't like him.
- Why not?

105
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,901
He's overqualified.

106
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:34,335
Well, so were you.

107
00:06:34,403 --> 00:06:36,471
SUIT: Jesse, Carter Hansen
wants to see you

108
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:37,972
over at City Hall.

109
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,540
- Did he say why?
- No.

110
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:40,875
My sense is that it's urgent.

111
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:55,657
HANSEN: Any comment?

112
00:06:55,724 --> 00:06:57,759
They misspelled "Healy."

113
00:06:57,826 --> 00:06:59,560
Well, they got
<i>your</i> name right.

114
00:07:00,596 --> 00:07:02,830
Another shooting
incident.

115
00:07:02,898 --> 00:07:04,632
What were <i>you</i>
doing there?

116
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:07,201
Talking to a friend.

117
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:08,403
Did this stakeout

118
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,238
have anything to do
with Paradise?

119
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:12,173
- It wasn't a stakeout.
- Did it have

120
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:14,242
anything to do with this town?

121
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,843
No.

122
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:17,412
You were
moonlighting.

123
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,180
Actually, I was drinking coffee.

124
00:07:19,248 --> 00:07:21,849
When the town council
hired you,

125
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:23,151
we made it clear

126
00:07:23,218 --> 00:07:24,586
that the Paradise
chief of police

127
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,788
does not have
a 9:00 to 5:00 job.

128
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:28,122
I know that.

129
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,191
And with the departure
of Officer DeAngelo,

130
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:31,759
it's more important
than ever

131
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:32,961
for you
to be here.

132
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:36,497
To show the flag, so to speak.

133
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,338
So, um...

134
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:45,807
how did the interview go
this morning?

135
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:47,075
What interview?

136
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:49,077
Candidate seems
highly qualified.

137
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:53,548
I don't think
hiring your son-in-law

138
00:07:53,616 --> 00:07:55,550
- is a good idea.
- Strike that.

139
00:07:55,618 --> 00:08:00,321
For the record, Paradise
promotes tourism, not crime.

140
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:02,757
Crime is bad
for business,

141
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:04,726
and some
of your exploits

142
00:08:04,793 --> 00:08:06,594
garner headlines
that we don't need

143
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:08,096
and we don't appreciate.

144
00:08:08,163 --> 00:08:11,432
I see it as my job
not to look the other way.

145
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,801
Well, I've called a meeting
of the full council

146
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,436
for 10:00 tomorrow morning.

147
00:08:15,504 --> 00:08:16,471
Good for you.

148
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,772
We can fire you.

149
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,173
You can.

150
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:21,943
But you can't tell me
what to do.

151
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:31,653
(speaking faintly, indistinctly)

152
00:08:35,157 --> 00:08:36,291
Mrs. Healy called.

153
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:37,825
She just got back.

154
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,427
She said, "Thanks
for saving his life."

155
00:08:39,495 --> 00:08:41,429
She told me
what happened.

156
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:42,430
Why didn't you?

157
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:43,431
Old habit.

158
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:44,432
Who's that?

159
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,867
I don't know.

160
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:48,636
No one tells me anything
around here.

161
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:50,038
ROSE: Jesse.

162
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:53,474
Why don't you come in, Suit?

163
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:55,043
Can I?

164
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,878
You can.

165
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:03,785
ROSE: Jesse, this is
Elizabeth Blue.

166
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:05,954
Her baby was kidnapped
a few years ago.

167
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:09,023
She thinks he might
be in Paradise.

168
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,025
Where was the baby
kidnapped?

169
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,026
ROSE: Albuquerque, New Mexico.

170
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,094
Little Boy Blue.

171
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:14,162
It was all over

172
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:15,496
the news.

173
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,366
That was quite a while ago,
wasn't it?

174
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:20,568
December 28, 2000.

175
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:22,203
Seven years.

176
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,038
Wasn't the body recovered?

177
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:26,207
You know this case?

178
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,909
Know of.

179
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,178
That wasn't my baby.

180
00:09:30,246 --> 00:09:31,379
I thought
the body

181
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:32,880
was identified.

182
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,549
My husband...

183
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:38,586
A baby's body was found
in a dry riverbed

184
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:40,154
near the
Mexican border.

185
00:09:40,222 --> 00:09:41,856
It had the
hospital

186
00:09:41,924 --> 00:09:43,291
wristband on it.

187
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:45,560
But it was...

188
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:47,362
Decomposed?

189
00:09:49,832 --> 00:09:51,933
My husband
had the remains buried.

190
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:54,535
He didn't think that I
was strong enough to see it.

191
00:09:54,603 --> 00:09:55,770
ROSE: And you think your son

192
00:09:55,838 --> 00:09:57,438
is alive and here
in Paradise.

193
00:09:57,506 --> 00:09:58,740
I know it.

194
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,308
You got a feeling.

195
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:01,409
ROSE: Why do you think

196
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:02,610
he's here, Elizabeth?

197
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:06,080
I received an anonymous letter.

198
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,249
It said...

199
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:11,185
"Your child is loved."

200
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:13,955
ROSE: And it was postmarked Paradise?

201
00:10:14,023 --> 00:10:16,791
JESSE: Did you get

202
00:10:16,859 --> 00:10:18,326
any other letters?

203
00:10:20,062 --> 00:10:21,129
Yes.

204
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:22,230
From other places?

205
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:23,231
Yes.

206
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:24,732
How many?

207
00:10:25,768 --> 00:10:27,168
Hundreds.

208
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:30,638
SUIT: So, why Paradise?

209
00:10:30,706 --> 00:10:32,206
Because this one

210
00:10:32,274 --> 00:10:34,943
haunts me.

211
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,579
"Your child is loved."

212
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:42,450
I just want my son back.

213
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:48,990
Mrs. Blue, anybody
could have written that letter.

214
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,159
You're looking

215
00:10:51,226 --> 00:10:53,328
at the entire
Paradise police force.

216
00:10:53,395 --> 00:10:55,930
A letter
like that...

217
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:00,835
I don't think there's anything
we can do to help you.

218
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:04,639
I'm sorry.

219
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:10,178
(sniffles)

220
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:17,652
I have to
get back

221
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,354
to Boston in the morning.

222
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:21,256
I have to be in Albuquerque
for work,

223
00:11:21,323 --> 00:11:23,658
and I can't miss my bus.

224
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,668
(gunshots)

225
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:46,114
(firing stops)

226
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,218
If you have to use that,
you're going to have problems.

227
00:11:50,286 --> 00:11:52,353
- Safety's on the wrong side.
- Safety's on the wrong side.

228
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,722
You could install an
ambidextrous safety.

229
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,990
I don't like them.

230
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:57,659
They break too easily.

231
00:11:57,726 --> 00:11:59,894
Too much torque.

232
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:02,864
You're doing a
lot better, Rose.

233
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:04,332
That one would
have definitely

234
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,533
ruined someone's
evening.

235
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:15,743
ROSE: When were you
planning on

236
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:17,111
telling me you were shot?

237
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:20,448
Clearly I didn't need to.

238
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:23,251
Why do I get the feeling
that's only one shoe?

239
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:26,387
You're not even gonna try
to look for that woman's baby?

240
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:29,324
This is a small town;
how hard can it be?

241
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:31,459
That kidnapping
was all over the news, Rose.

242
00:12:31,527 --> 00:12:32,627
This is a small town.

243
00:12:32,695 --> 00:12:34,162
Exactly.

244
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:35,530
SUIT: Someone would have noticed

245
00:12:35,598 --> 00:12:36,898
a new baby
without a pregnancy, Rose.

246
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:40,235
Maybe they didn't move here
until later.

247
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,637
Just so they could send
an incriminating letter?

248
00:12:42,705 --> 00:12:44,072
Who's "they"
and how do you find them?

249
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,807
I don't know.

250
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:46,975
What do you think, Suit?

251
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:49,410
What do I think
or what do I feel, Lou?

252
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:52,480
Either one.

253
00:12:54,516 --> 00:12:56,517
I feel the baby's dead.

254
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,927
(frogs croaking,
insects chittering)

255
00:13:35,257 --> 00:13:36,858
# #

256
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:51,906
(sighs softly)

257
00:14:02,418 --> 00:14:04,252
ROSE: Jesse, where are you?

258
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,554
He's been sitting here
for half an hour.

259
00:14:06,622 --> 00:14:09,591
I guess I'll start
the interview without you.

260
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:12,860
You need to get a cell phone.

261
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:14,495
(click, beep)

262
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:15,530
JENN: Jesse.

263
00:14:15,598 --> 00:14:16,864
It's Jenn.

264
00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:17,865
I...

265
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:19,300
(phone ringing)

266
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:21,202
I need you to call me tonight.

267
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,037
It's about Elliot.

268
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:24,539
I was hoping to talk to you.

269
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:25,773
I...

270
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:28,076
Hello.

271
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:29,244
JENN: Hello, Jesse.

272
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:30,245
Hello, Jenn.

273
00:14:30,312 --> 00:14:32,280
How are you?

274
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:33,281
Fine.

275
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:35,049
Are you alone?

276
00:14:35,117 --> 00:14:37,118
No. I'm talking with you, Jenn.

277
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:40,955
Are you drinking?

278
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,625
I'm having my first
of two scotches.

279
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:46,127
Jesse, why do you drink
when you're alone?

280
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:48,196
You sound like
your psychiatrist.

281
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:51,065
He's your psychiatrist, Jesse.

282
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:53,134
Okay.

283
00:14:53,202 --> 00:14:57,138
Jesse, I still care about you.

284
00:14:57,206 --> 00:14:59,574
It's about Elliot.

285
00:14:59,642 --> 00:15:03,444
He wants me to move in with him.

286
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:06,281
Okay.

287
00:15:06,348 --> 00:15:08,416
How do you feel about that?

288
00:15:08,484 --> 00:15:11,219
How do I feel about that?

289
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:13,154
It would be unethical.

290
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:15,089
What are you talking about?

291
00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:17,792
A Hollywood weather girl
living with her producer.

292
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,861
(click)

293
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:25,133
(sighs softly)

294
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:27,435
(receiver rattles)

295
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:33,741
What are you looking at?

296
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,810
(thunder rumbles softly)

297
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,341
# #

298
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:30,993
So you know who the shooter was?

299
00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:33,062
JESSE: Healy couldn't say.

300
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:35,240
Is he gonna make it?

301
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:39,775
I don't know.
I'm going in this morning.

302
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,100
Did you hit the guy?

303
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,845
I would say yes,

304
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:44,661
with my second shot.

305
00:16:44,662 --> 00:16:46,150
It's got to have
something to do with

306
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:47,576
who he was staking out.

307
00:16:47,644 --> 00:16:49,144
Did he tell you who?

308
00:16:49,212 --> 00:16:50,879
He got evasive.

309
00:16:50,947 --> 00:16:51,880
You know.

310
00:16:51,948 --> 00:16:53,082
You were a cop.

311
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:54,316
Which means it has
something to do

312
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:56,685
with who he was
staking out.

313
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:58,988
Jenn's moving in
with her producer.

314
00:16:59,055 --> 00:17:00,756
Elliot?

315
00:17:00,824 --> 00:17:01,924
The guy who had sex

316
00:17:01,992 --> 00:17:03,826
with my wife two days after

317
00:17:03,893 --> 00:17:06,362
our "let's get acquainted
with my new boss" dinner.

318
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:15,471
So how do you feel about that?

319
00:17:17,507 --> 00:17:20,743
How do I feel about that?

320
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,511
I don't know.

321
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,113
Maybe you should ask Suitcase.

322
00:17:26,149 --> 00:17:27,850
He didn't make Jenn do it,
did he?

323
00:17:27,918 --> 00:17:29,685
He's on my list.

324
00:17:29,753 --> 00:17:31,520
What list is that?

325
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:37,259
Jenn called you
before I started here.

326
00:17:37,327 --> 00:17:39,595
Yeah, she did.

327
00:17:39,663 --> 00:17:41,096
What'd she tell you?

328
00:17:41,164 --> 00:17:42,564
I can't tell you that.

329
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:46,268
What can you tell me?

330
00:17:46,336 --> 00:17:47,970
I can tell you that

331
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:50,639
two drinks alone at night
is a lousy rule.

332
00:17:50,707 --> 00:17:53,442
It's not a rule.

333
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,843
Exactly.

334
00:17:56,846 --> 00:17:59,415
So did you go in the tank
after she called?

335
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,785
Almost.

336
00:18:02,852 --> 00:18:04,486
- So you called me.
- Yeah.

337
00:18:04,554 --> 00:18:06,322
Why?

338
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,194
Because I really like you.

339
00:18:12,262 --> 00:18:14,897
Why don't you kiss my ass?

340
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:18,267
(sighs)

341
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:22,037
Every time we start
to figure something out,

342
00:18:22,105 --> 00:18:24,907
you make some wise-ass remark
or you take a hike on me.

343
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:28,811
(sighs)

344
00:18:28,878 --> 00:18:31,847
Who kidnaps babies?

345
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:33,148
What?

346
00:18:33,216 --> 00:18:34,850
I want to know
who kidnaps babies.

347
00:18:34,918 --> 00:18:35,985
It's my time.

348
00:18:36,052 --> 00:18:38,053
I pay you 165 bucks an hour.

349
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:39,855
180 bucks an hour.

350
00:18:39,923 --> 00:18:41,657
Is this something
we're investigating?

351
00:18:41,725 --> 00:18:43,425
No.

352
00:18:45,028 --> 00:18:47,830
In the old days, it was people
who couldn't have babies

353
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:49,398
or had lost a baby.

354
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:50,733
Nowadays,
it's a service industry.

355
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,937
People steal babies
to sell them.

356
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:57,740
Or their parts.

357
00:18:57,807 --> 00:18:59,408
Why so early?

358
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:01,377
I got a town council meeting.

359
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:03,112
They're on your ass.

360
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:06,081
Small town.

361
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:08,550
Police department down to three.

362
00:19:08,618 --> 00:19:11,387
Well...

363
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:13,422
two and one with
his hand tied

364
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,790
behind his back.

365
00:19:14,858 --> 00:19:16,191
Suit's on light ad.

366
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:17,793
Actually, it's one
and two people with

367
00:19:17,861 --> 00:19:19,695
one hand tied behind their back.

368
00:19:19,763 --> 00:19:23,966
You're up to your shorts
in an attempted murder or murder

369
00:19:24,034 --> 00:19:25,167
of a police officer.

370
00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:26,869
Two police officers.

371
00:19:26,937 --> 00:19:28,671
You fired your weapon;
you're gonna need

372
00:19:28,738 --> 00:19:30,706
- a good lawyer.
- It's just Internal Affairs.

373
00:19:30,774 --> 00:19:33,917
Exactly. You're gonna need
a good lawyer.

374
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:38,492
Did you get shot in the arm?

375
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:40,983
Yes.

376
00:19:41,051 --> 00:19:44,753
Did they give
you a sling?

377
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:46,322
Yes.

378
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:49,325
So you're choosing
not to help yourself get better.

379
00:19:49,392 --> 00:19:52,127
I sense a parable.

380
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:01,870
(woman talking quietly)

381
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:16,252
(door opens)

382
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,621
Come on in, Jesse.

383
00:20:18,688 --> 00:20:21,490
PERKINS: This is great.

384
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:23,325
Excuse me?

385
00:20:23,393 --> 00:20:25,928
This is my first non-
fatal bullet wound.

386
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:28,664
You're lucky.

387
00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:30,766
No bone, just
soft tissue.

388
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:32,101
Looks like they did a good job.

389
00:20:32,168 --> 00:20:34,770
No infection.

390
00:20:34,838 --> 00:20:36,705
Stitches have pulled
a little bit.

391
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:38,440
Should be okay if
you're careful.

392
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:40,476
Shouldn't you have a sling?

393
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:42,478
They said I didn't need one.

394
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:47,983
Pediatricians don't
deliver babies.

395
00:20:48,051 --> 00:20:49,718
No, we attend
the birth.

396
00:20:49,786 --> 00:20:51,720
How hard is it to access
birth records, Doc?

397
00:20:51,788 --> 00:20:55,958
Big city, you'd need some sort
of court order, but here...

398
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:56,959
Why?

399
00:20:57,027 --> 00:20:58,727
No reason.

400
00:20:58,795 --> 00:21:00,229
I see you got
new business cards.

401
00:21:00,297 --> 00:21:01,997
"Peter Perkins.

402
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:03,966
Pediatrician/Medical Examiner."

403
00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:06,168
I'm proud to be

404
00:21:06,236 --> 00:21:08,003
your medical examiner.

405
00:21:08,071 --> 00:21:09,838
But you keep them
in a little plastic hippo.

406
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:10,873
What can I say?

407
00:21:10,941 --> 00:21:13,342
You made me a hyphenate.

408
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,344
I'm proud of being
a pediatrician, too.

409
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:25,254
Sorry.

410
00:21:25,322 --> 00:21:26,689
I was fighting crime.

411
00:21:26,756 --> 00:21:29,959
Chief Stone,
losing Officer DeAngelo

412
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:31,026
was a serious blow

413
00:21:31,094 --> 00:21:33,162
to the Paradise
Police Department.

414
00:21:33,229 --> 00:21:37,399
Yeah, in the last month,
Officer Gammon wrote 47 tickets,

415
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:41,570
Officer DeAngelo
wrote 174 tickets,

416
00:21:41,638 --> 00:21:45,574
Officer Simpson was
on light administrative duties,

417
00:21:45,642 --> 00:21:47,042
and you wrote six.

418
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,944
I'm the police chief.

419
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:51,580
DeAngelo was the Babe Ruth
of parking tickets.

420
00:21:51,648 --> 00:21:52,548
And you drove him out.

421
00:21:52,616 --> 00:21:54,416
I may have.

422
00:21:54,484 --> 00:21:55,551
Why?

423
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:56,752
I didn't like him.

424
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:01,557
So, uh, how's
Officer Simpson doing?

425
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,526
I'd like to release him
from light ad.

426
00:22:04,594 --> 00:22:06,195
No adverse effects
from the coma?

427
00:22:06,263 --> 00:22:08,597
None.

428
00:22:08,665 --> 00:22:10,032
We'll take it
under consideration.

429
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,368
Who's manning
the entrance to town?

430
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:14,862
- The speed trap?
- Now, strike that.

431
00:22:15,705 --> 00:22:16,639
No one.

432
00:22:16,706 --> 00:22:18,040
Why not?

433
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:19,441
I don't think it's ethical.

434
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:20,576
Brings in a lot of revenue.

435
00:22:22,178 --> 00:22:23,946
You like movies, Chief Stone?

436
00:22:24,014 --> 00:22:25,948
Good ones.

437
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:27,082
Yeah.

438
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,651
Well, we think
you police this town

439
00:22:28,718 --> 00:22:30,886
like a cowboy sheriff
in a bad movie.

440
00:22:30,954 --> 00:22:32,288
We think?

441
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,392
I think you're making up
your own rules.

442
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:37,793
Like Little Bill Daggett.

443
00:22:37,861 --> 00:22:39,295
Excuse me?

444
00:22:39,362 --> 00:22:40,429
Gene Hackman in <i>Unforgiven.</i>

445
00:22:40,497 --> 00:22:42,731
I would
prefer that

446
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,301
you think of me as
a benevolent Gene Hackman.

447
00:22:45,368 --> 00:22:47,836
Boy, that was a good movie.

448
00:22:47,904 --> 00:22:50,639
Well, cinema commentary
aside, Morris...

449
00:22:50,707 --> 00:22:53,742
Get this, Chief Stone.

450
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,244
We know we can't fire you

451
00:22:55,312 --> 00:22:58,247
without notice,
but we do have other options.

452
00:22:58,315 --> 00:22:59,682
You could be suspended.

453
00:22:59,749 --> 00:23:01,383
We could dock your pay.

454
00:23:01,451 --> 00:23:05,955
But whatever we choose to do,
consider yourself warned.

455
00:23:23,607 --> 00:23:25,174
(school bell ringing)

456
00:23:25,242 --> 00:23:27,243
(kids shouting playfully)

457
00:23:55,338 --> 00:23:57,339
# #

458
00:24:21,131 --> 00:24:24,233
# #

459
00:24:40,517 --> 00:24:43,319
JESSE: It's hard to move on.

460
00:24:44,988 --> 00:24:46,989
I had a few questions.

461
00:24:47,057 --> 00:24:49,658
You changed your mind?

462
00:24:49,726 --> 00:24:51,927
No, I didn't.

463
00:24:53,663 --> 00:24:55,297
You said you got a letter.

464
00:24:59,402 --> 00:25:01,503
This the original
envelope?

465
00:25:01,571 --> 00:25:02,571
Yes, Chief Stone.

466
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:04,373
Jesse.

467
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,844
Jesse.

468
00:25:08,912 --> 00:25:11,847
Why would somebody write you
five years later?

469
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:17,119
As you know,
the press had a field day

470
00:25:17,187 --> 00:25:19,154
with my baby's
kidnapping.

471
00:25:19,222 --> 00:25:21,290
"Little Boy Blue" was

472
00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:23,392
just too good a headline.

473
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,662
I think the story
finally disappeared

474
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:32,334
when a pop singer went into
rehab for the 14th time.

475
00:25:34,905 --> 00:25:38,307
A cable station did
a fifth-anniversary show.

476
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,542
And they asked me
about my son.

477
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:43,379
And you said you had a feeling
your son was still alive.

478
00:25:43,446 --> 00:25:46,448
I still do.

479
00:25:46,516 --> 00:25:48,717
And that started the letters?

480
00:25:48,785 --> 00:25:50,486
That inspired that letter.

481
00:25:52,222 --> 00:25:54,957
Why'd you wait so long
after receiving it?

482
00:25:55,025 --> 00:25:58,260
My husband kept it from me.

483
00:25:58,328 --> 00:26:00,229
He didn't think I should see it.

484
00:26:00,297 --> 00:26:03,065
How did you feel about that?

485
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:05,968
I left him.

486
00:26:06,036 --> 00:26:09,071
Because of this letter?

487
00:26:12,008 --> 00:26:16,478
Our marriage had deteriorated
to such a point that...

488
00:26:18,882 --> 00:26:20,449
Basically, yes.

489
00:26:21,685 --> 00:26:23,719
(girl laughing nearby)

490
00:26:23,787 --> 00:26:27,423
MAN (over P.A.): Bus number 24
westbound service to Philadelphia,

491
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,358
Knoxville, Little Rock,
Albuquerque...

492
00:26:29,426 --> 00:26:31,994
I have to go back to work.

493
00:26:32,062 --> 00:26:34,930
Now boarding at platform A-C.

494
00:26:34,998 --> 00:26:37,566
Send me everything you have
overnight.

495
00:26:39,603 --> 00:26:41,103
You'll find my son?

496
00:26:41,171 --> 00:26:43,105
I didn't say that.

497
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:53,782
His name is Adam.

498
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,842
Eileen?
(monitor beeping)

499
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,877
I don't know, Eileen.

500
00:27:10,945 --> 00:27:14,519
Captain Healy,
everything's okay.

501
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,129
Eileen?

502
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,715
You're gonna be
feeling some gas,

503
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:19,434
it's okay to release it.

504
00:27:19,435 --> 00:27:21,164
I'll stay anyway.

505
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:23,723
Press that
if anything happens.

506
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:25,725
(distant phone ringing)

507
00:27:25,793 --> 00:27:28,728
Eileen?

508
00:27:28,796 --> 00:27:31,731
Could I have some...

509
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,800
some ice?

510
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,279
How close was I?

511
00:27:46,347 --> 00:27:49,282
You were definitely
circling the drain.

512
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,384
So who do you think
shot you?

513
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:53,420
I didn't see the shooter.

514
00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:55,622
Did you?

515
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,257
I think I shot him.

516
00:27:57,325 --> 00:27:59,259
Did you know him?

517
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:00,694
Not in silhouette.

518
00:28:00,761 --> 00:28:03,029
I ran everybody in
the building.

519
00:28:03,097 --> 00:28:04,698
No priors.

520
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:06,399
Who were you staking out?

521
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:09,402
Oh... don't get into that.

522
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,404
- I have to.
- Why?

523
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:13,173
Because he shot me, too.

524
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,810
Come here.

525
00:28:19,847 --> 00:28:21,748
I was keeping

526
00:28:21,816 --> 00:28:23,617
an eye on my nephew.

527
00:28:23,684 --> 00:28:26,286
Okay.

528
00:28:26,354 --> 00:28:28,388
My sister thinks

529
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,423
he's having an affair
with his saxophone

530
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:33,426
teacher.

531
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:35,996
Okay.

532
00:28:36,063 --> 00:28:41,201
He's 18, she's 35.

533
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:42,836
So, was he?

534
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,873
Hmm.

535
00:28:46,941 --> 00:28:48,909
So, tell me...

536
00:28:48,976 --> 00:28:52,336
Did you ever have an affair
with an older woman?

537
00:28:52,371 --> 00:28:53,480
Yes.

538
00:28:53,548 --> 00:28:54,648
You?

539
00:28:54,715 --> 00:28:56,650
Yes.

540
00:28:56,717 --> 00:28:58,724
Bear any psychological scars?

541
00:28:58,759 --> 00:28:59,753
No.

542
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,254
Just fond memories.

543
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,523
Uh-huh.
(chuckles)

544
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:05,625
So who do you think shot you?

545
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,663
I haven't a clue.

546
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:16,736
Okay.

547
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,644
(mechanical whirring)

548
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,687
(dial tone)

549
00:29:39,227 --> 00:29:41,628
This is Jim Kennedy, the
governor's chief of staff.

550
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:45,131
The governor was just visiting
the state homicide commander

551
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:47,634
who's recovering from his second
surgery in two days,

552
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,669
and we seem to be missing
something here.

553
00:29:49,737 --> 00:29:52,472
We're missing 24-hour
police protection.

554
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,207
Do it.

555
00:30:15,363 --> 00:30:16,863
(footsteps approaching)

556
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:19,266
Where were you?

557
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,902
Out drinking all night.

558
00:30:21,969 --> 00:30:24,271
Give me a straight answer,
you son of a bitch.

559
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:27,707
Healy's going to live.

560
00:30:27,775 --> 00:30:30,577
I'm sorry, Jesse.

561
00:30:30,645 --> 00:30:32,646
If he survives the gas.

562
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,851
You are a son of a bitch.

563
00:30:41,956 --> 00:30:43,623
I want to find Little Boy Blue.

564
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:45,091
Well, if you find him,

565
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:46,927
- see if he took a shot at Healy.
- Somebody wrote

566
00:30:46,994 --> 00:30:48,862
that letter;
they know where he is.

567
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,263
The baby is in his grave.

568
00:30:50,331 --> 00:30:51,998
And if he's not,
he could be anyplace.

569
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:53,567
The letter tells us nothing.

570
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:54,968
It said, "Your child is loved."

571
00:30:55,036 --> 00:30:56,603
- Is loved.
- As in:

572
00:30:56,671 --> 00:30:58,605
God loves all children.

573
00:30:58,673 --> 00:31:00,774
Or as in: the writer is crazy.

574
00:31:00,842 --> 00:31:02,309
Jesse, she came
all this way

575
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:03,343
on hope.

576
00:31:03,411 --> 00:31:05,078
2,000 miles on a bus.

577
00:31:05,146 --> 00:31:06,413
Don't you think we owe her?

578
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,582
What if he lived here
and moved away?

579
00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:11,084
What if he never lived here
but just stopped by

580
00:31:11,152 --> 00:31:12,819
to mail the letter?

581
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:14,254
What if some vacationing tourist

582
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:16,289
decided to send
an encouraging note?

583
00:31:16,357 --> 00:31:18,592
Jesse, I know I'm not
an experienced

584
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,794
cop like you,
but what are we

585
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:23,663
doing here if we won't look
for a little lost boy?

586
00:31:23,731 --> 00:31:25,298
You can only do what you can do.

587
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:26,333
But he might
be here!

588
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,801
She needs to know

589
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:29,269
that somebody did
absolutely

590
00:31:29,337 --> 00:31:30,937
everything they could
to find him.

591
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:33,206
I can't justify opening up
a seven-year-old,

592
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:34,574
out-of-state kidnapping.

593
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,009
We have to try!

594
00:31:36,077 --> 00:31:37,210
I won't.

595
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,747
Paradise is my last stop, Rose.

596
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,516
There's nowhere to go
from here.

597
00:31:44,552 --> 00:31:46,653
Then I'm going to do it.

598
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,688
On my own time.

599
00:31:48,756 --> 00:31:50,857
I can't stop you.

600
00:31:50,925 --> 00:31:51,992
Yes, you can.

601
00:31:53,027 --> 00:31:54,961
But I won't.

602
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:57,030
Good.

603
00:32:01,602 --> 00:32:03,703
What are you thinking?

604
00:32:03,771 --> 00:32:06,907
I was thinking,
if I ever get kidnapped,

605
00:32:06,974 --> 00:32:08,975
I hope you're on the case.

606
00:32:14,382 --> 00:32:17,117
(distant siren wailing)

607
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,352
(squeaking)

608
00:32:20,454 --> 00:32:22,355
Could the shooter have
been after you?

609
00:32:22,423 --> 00:32:24,191
- No.
- Because?

610
00:32:24,258 --> 00:32:26,259
Why go after me
from the driver's side?

611
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:28,495
- Did you discharge your weapon?
- I did.

612
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:30,497
How many discharges?

613
00:32:30,565 --> 00:32:31,631
Two.

614
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,633
Any shooting incidents
in LA Homicide?

615
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,268
- Yes.
- How many?

616
00:32:35,336 --> 00:32:36,603
- One.
- Fatality?

617
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:38,638
Are you asking me
or reading about it?

618
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:50,383
Chief Stone, you have been
police chief of Paradise

619
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:51,718
for almost three years.

620
00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:52,953
That's correct.

621
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,855
How many shooting incidents?

622
00:32:59,293 --> 00:33:00,460
Six.

623
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:01,828
Four.

624
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,663
Twice, the sentence was carried
out for me.

625
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,967
"The sentence," now that's an
interesting take on police work.

626
00:33:07,034 --> 00:33:08,468
Four.

627
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:09,970
Fatalities?

628
00:33:10,037 --> 00:33:11,771
Four.

629
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:13,139
A rather conspicuous use
of deadly force.

630
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:14,741
Why use deadly force
if it isn't deadly?

631
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:16,376
Chief Stone, you are aware...

632
00:33:16,444 --> 00:33:17,410
That, as a good guy,

633
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:19,246
I'm responsible for every round

634
00:33:19,313 --> 00:33:20,714
from the moment it leaves
the barrel

635
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:22,782
until it reaches its
final resting place.

636
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:27,888
You said you think you may
have hit the assailant

637
00:33:27,955 --> 00:33:29,923
- with one shot?
- That's correct.

638
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:32,392
Where did the other one go,
Chief Stone?

639
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,027
Jesse.

640
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:37,030
Where did the other one go,
Chief Stone?

641
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:40,367
Into a brick wall.

642
00:33:40,434 --> 00:33:43,170
How long have you been
in Internal Affairs?

643
00:33:43,237 --> 00:33:45,572
Almost three years.

644
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,875
Ever been in the field,
Officer Greenstreet?

645
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,911
Sidney.

646
00:33:50,978 --> 00:33:53,180
You ever been in the field,
Sidney?

647
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:55,549
I have, Jesse.

648
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,884
You ever shot anybody, Sidney?

649
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:58,885
I have.

650
00:33:58,953 --> 00:33:59,920
It's...

651
00:33:59,987 --> 00:34:01,254
Disturbing.

652
00:34:01,322 --> 00:34:02,622
Are you married, Sidney?

653
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,624
Divorced.

654
00:34:04,692 --> 00:34:06,226
As are you.

655
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,094
Jesse.

656
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,965
Jesse.

657
00:34:16,103 --> 00:34:18,104
MAN: Keep 'em up.

658
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,709
To the body,
to the body.

659
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:27,647
Hello.

660
00:34:27,715 --> 00:34:29,316
And you are?

661
00:34:29,383 --> 00:34:31,184
You don't remember me?

662
00:34:31,252 --> 00:34:33,220
I remember the hat.

663
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:34,554
PPD.

664
00:34:34,622 --> 00:34:35,889
Paradise.

665
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:37,591
I'd like to speak to Mr. Fish.

666
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,594
Mr. Fish is not in.

667
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:43,763
Alan.

668
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,665
- You remember me!
- Alan...

669
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:47,334
he's right over there.

670
00:34:47,401 --> 00:34:49,736
Mr. Fish is not in.

671
00:34:49,804 --> 00:34:53,139
If Mr. Fish were in, I
think I'd know about it.

672
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:56,543
Jesse Stone.

673
00:34:58,045 --> 00:34:59,613
Mr. Fish is in.

674
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,659
I had nothing to do with
shooting Captain Healy.

675
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:14,661
Actually, I was hoping

676
00:35:14,729 --> 00:35:16,763
you could help me acquire some
methamphetamines.

677
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:19,499
I read about it
in the paper.

678
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:22,169
Shooting cops is bad
for business.

679
00:35:22,236 --> 00:35:24,404
Exactly.

680
00:35:24,472 --> 00:35:26,439
You hear things.

681
00:35:26,507 --> 00:35:28,175
Oh, I hear lots of things.

682
00:35:28,242 --> 00:35:29,209
Why would I tell you?

683
00:35:29,277 --> 00:35:31,978
Because you really like me.

684
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,780
- I didn't shoot anyone.
- I know.

685
00:35:33,848 --> 00:35:35,482
So why do you
come to me?

686
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,185
You're the only mobster I know.

687
00:35:38,252 --> 00:35:41,121
You knew my friend Leo Finn.

688
00:35:41,189 --> 00:35:42,455
And you killed him.

689
00:35:42,523 --> 00:35:44,424
Actually, his bodyguard
killed him.

690
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:45,792
Lovey Norris

691
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,194
was trying to shoot you.

692
00:35:47,261 --> 00:35:48,695
How do you know?

693
00:35:48,763 --> 00:35:50,997
Assumption.

694
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,999
Good assumption.

695
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,502
Suffice it to
say, but for

696
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,371
your exasperating directness,

697
00:35:58,439 --> 00:36:00,407
my friend would still be alive.

698
00:36:00,474 --> 00:36:02,509
He wasn't your friend.

699
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,677
Colleague.

700
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,212
We went to the same church.

701
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:06,546
You were choir boys together?

702
00:36:06,614 --> 00:36:09,349
I didn't say that.

703
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,018
So you won't help me.

704
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,820
No.

705
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:17,057
You could keep your eyes
and ears open.

706
00:36:17,124 --> 00:36:18,825
I always do.

707
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:21,895
It was nice to see
you, Jesse Stone.

708
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,066
(trainer speaking
indistinctly)

709
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:27,868
Come on, come on.

710
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,252
How's the crime scene
at Paradise Doughnuts.

711
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:52,236
Under constant surveillance.

712
00:36:52,304 --> 00:36:55,072
I feel doughnuts certify
one's copness.

713
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,308
No coffee?

714
00:36:57,376 --> 00:36:59,210
My body's
a temple.

715
00:36:59,278 --> 00:37:00,211
Want one?

716
00:37:00,279 --> 00:37:02,246
My body's a temple.

717
00:37:03,315 --> 00:37:05,283
You just getting back
from Boston?

718
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,018
How do you know
I was in Boston?

719
00:37:07,085 --> 00:37:08,219
Information's out there;

720
00:37:08,287 --> 00:37:10,855
all you have to do is let it in.

721
00:37:10,923 --> 00:37:11,856
So who shot Healy?

722
00:37:11,924 --> 00:37:13,858
I have no idea.

723
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:15,359
My sense is it had something

724
00:37:15,427 --> 00:37:16,961
- to do with the stakeout.
- It had

725
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:18,229
nothing to do
with the stakeout.

726
00:37:18,297 --> 00:37:19,664
So you think.

727
00:37:19,731 --> 00:37:21,232
So Healy knows.

728
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,667
Oh.

729
00:37:22,734 --> 00:37:24,635
He was monitoring
a saxophone lesson,

730
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:26,704
which leaves
me nowhere.

731
00:37:26,772 --> 00:37:28,539
Stir the pot.

732
00:37:28,607 --> 00:37:29,640
We going after this?

733
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:32,410
I'm going after this.

734
00:37:36,815 --> 00:37:39,750
You still seeing
Cissy Hathaway?

735
00:37:39,818 --> 00:37:41,085
What do you mean?

736
00:37:41,153 --> 00:37:43,087
Well, she's older...

737
00:37:43,155 --> 00:37:45,656
How'd you know?

738
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:46,824
The information's out there.

739
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:49,193
All you have to do is let it in.

740
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:52,063
You feel damaged
in any way?

741
00:37:52,131 --> 00:37:53,064
No.

742
00:37:53,132 --> 00:37:54,499
Cissy teach you anything?

743
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:56,534
A lot.

744
00:37:56,602 --> 00:37:58,770
Well, there you go.

745
00:37:58,837 --> 00:38:01,472
How'd the town
council meeting go?

746
00:38:03,742 --> 00:38:05,743
You pick a fight?

747
00:38:06,779 --> 00:38:08,880
No.

748
00:38:08,947 --> 00:38:12,884
Maybe we should start
manning the speed trap.

749
00:38:12,951 --> 00:38:15,119
I don't like the speed trap.

750
00:38:15,187 --> 00:38:17,121
I know, the speed
trap isn't ethical.

751
00:38:17,189 --> 00:38:19,123
Speeding is
speeding, Jesse.

752
00:38:19,191 --> 00:38:20,558
It's the law.

753
00:38:20,626 --> 00:38:23,427
The speed limit changes
and nobody can see the sign.

754
00:38:23,495 --> 00:38:25,396
Exactly.

755
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:29,133
You want to man it, man it.

756
00:38:30,135 --> 00:38:32,937
(thunder rumbling, rain falling)

757
00:38:56,462 --> 00:38:58,429
Getting shot didn't
slow you down.

758
00:38:58,497 --> 00:38:59,897
How do you know?

759
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:03,868
Guess we'll have to wait till
you're healed and try again.

760
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:06,370
I like the
word "again."

761
00:39:06,438 --> 00:39:08,639
So, Sidney...

762
00:39:08,707 --> 00:39:11,008
Did your wife remarry, Jesse?

763
00:39:11,076 --> 00:39:12,276
No, Sidney.

764
00:39:12,344 --> 00:39:14,045
Now that we've had sex,

765
00:39:14,113 --> 00:39:16,147
do you think we could stop with
the whole first name ping-pong?

766
00:39:16,215 --> 00:39:18,049
Of course, Sidney.

767
00:39:18,117 --> 00:39:20,885
I just like saying it.

768
00:39:22,921 --> 00:39:25,022
Who was Healy staking out?

769
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:27,425
You're interrogating
me in your underwear.

770
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:29,427
I'm asking you
a question.

771
00:39:29,495 --> 00:39:30,561
It wasn't
a stakeout.

772
00:39:33,732 --> 00:39:37,235
My husband just told me
his new wife is having a baby.

773
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:41,105
My wife--

774
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:44,375
ex-wife-- just moved in
with her boyfriend.

775
00:39:44,443 --> 00:39:47,712
So we're both feeling kind of
disposable and in desperate need

776
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:52,113
of consolation and would be
inclined to turn a casual something

777
00:39:52,148 --> 00:39:53,351
into more than it was.

778
00:39:53,418 --> 00:39:56,387
On the other hand, there's
nothing wrong with consolation

779
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,792
So you think we
should be careful.

780
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:03,561
I think we should...

781
00:40:03,629 --> 00:40:06,731
carefully do this again.

782
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:12,804
Pals who have sex.

783
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:16,174
I've heard it described as that.

784
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,812
I like you,
Sidney.

785
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:23,781
You're the first person I've
met on the entire East Coast

786
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:26,451
who's more afraid of
commitment than I am.

787
00:40:28,787 --> 00:40:31,155
Ever had sex
with a younger man, Sidney?

788
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:33,391
Why do you ask?

789
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:35,193
I'm conducting a survey.

790
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,895
Nothing to say
to each other afterwards,

791
00:40:37,963 --> 00:40:40,264
but the young man had
a hell of a ride.

792
00:40:42,968 --> 00:40:44,368
I'll let myself out.

793
00:40:44,436 --> 00:40:45,536
Don't get up.

794
00:40:50,776 --> 00:40:53,778
I prefer to think of you
lying there in your afterglow.

795
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:25,743
# #

796
00:41:50,702 --> 00:41:52,837
(reporters clamoring)

797
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:58,109
(camera shutters snapping)

798
00:42:03,215 --> 00:42:06,918
Overwhelming evidence points
in the other direction,

799
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:09,787
<i>but there is no doubt in my mind</i>

800
00:42:09,888 --> 00:42:14,425
<i>that that baby was switched
for Adam.</i>

801
00:42:14,493 --> 00:42:18,029
MAN: <i>Do you have any proof?</i>

802
00:42:18,096 --> 00:42:20,198
ELIZABETH: <i>I just know.</i>

803
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:39,884
(rain patters in distance)

804
00:42:49,962 --> 00:42:52,964
# #

805
00:43:10,682 --> 00:43:13,785
(alarm beeping)

806
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:20,458
(beeping stops)

807
00:43:26,932 --> 00:43:29,934
(birds chirping)

808
00:43:58,297 --> 00:44:00,798
(birds chirping)

809
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:08,372
(sniffing)

810
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,141
(chain saw revving)

811
00:44:24,123 --> 00:44:25,056
(footsteps approaching)

812
00:44:25,124 --> 00:44:26,624
You're early.

813
00:44:26,692 --> 00:44:28,292
You're earlier.

814
00:44:29,862 --> 00:44:31,963
You have a phone message
on your desk.

815
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:32,964
Who was it?

816
00:44:33,031 --> 00:44:35,700
He wouldn't say.

817
00:44:35,768 --> 00:44:38,236
I've been up all night;
I couldn't sleep.

818
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:41,239
- How do I do it, Jesse?
- I use scotch.

819
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:42,640
How do I find Adam?

820
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:44,442
- What have you got?
- I don't have anything.

821
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:46,144
- We always have something.
- We?

822
00:44:46,211 --> 00:44:47,779
Figure of speech.

823
00:44:47,846 --> 00:44:50,181
Just start at the beginning.

824
00:44:50,249 --> 00:44:51,916
December 28, 2000,

825
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:54,018
Adam Blue is born.

826
00:44:54,086 --> 00:44:55,419
The next day
he disappears

827
00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:56,988
from his hospital
bed in Albuquerque.

828
00:44:57,055 --> 00:44:58,589
Remains with
his wrist ID

829
00:44:58,657 --> 00:45:02,026
end up near the Mexican border
six months later.

830
00:45:02,094 --> 00:45:03,327
The authorities assume

831
00:45:03,395 --> 00:45:04,529
the kidnappers escaped
across the border.

832
00:45:04,596 --> 00:45:05,730
Well, they wanted

833
00:45:05,798 --> 00:45:08,399
a closed case,
Feds'll do that.

834
00:45:08,467 --> 00:45:10,735
You know... that river runs
from Albuquerque

835
00:45:10,803 --> 00:45:12,370
right down
to where the body was found.

836
00:45:12,438 --> 00:45:14,372
How do you know that?

837
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,940
I played Triple-A ball
in Albuquerque.

838
00:45:16,008 --> 00:45:17,975
Anyway, it all but dries up
in the summer.

839
00:45:18,043 --> 00:45:20,044
They find a body snagged
on a branch,

840
00:45:20,112 --> 00:45:23,214
but it could have been dumped
in Mesita or anywhere upstream.

841
00:45:23,282 --> 00:45:25,483
Is Mesita
where the body was found?

842
00:45:25,551 --> 00:45:28,352
It's a little town-- 923 people.

843
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,855
No medical examiner,
no tests,

844
00:45:30,923 --> 00:45:32,356
no ID except for the father.

845
00:45:32,424 --> 00:45:34,725
How do you know this?

846
00:45:34,793 --> 00:45:36,994
What's this?

847
00:45:37,062 --> 00:45:38,796
Some stuff.

848
00:45:38,864 --> 00:45:39,831
Where'd you get it?

849
00:45:39,898 --> 00:45:40,832
Mailman.

850
00:45:40,899 --> 00:45:42,400
It's from Albuquerque.

851
00:45:42,468 --> 00:45:44,135
When did you talk
to the mother?

852
00:45:44,203 --> 00:45:47,138
You believe the boy's alive.

853
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:48,206
No,

854
00:45:48,273 --> 00:45:50,408
I don't, but I do believe

855
00:45:50,476 --> 00:45:52,810
Elizabeth deserves
a decent investigation.

856
00:45:52,878 --> 00:45:54,579
She sure hasn't gotten one
so far.

857
00:45:54,646 --> 00:45:56,214
She needs
to move on.

858
00:45:56,281 --> 00:45:58,015
The only thing
that'll let her is certainty.

859
00:45:58,083 --> 00:45:59,083
So you're going to help me?

860
00:45:59,151 --> 00:46:00,451
No.

861
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:02,153
Well, it seems to me
we could find

862
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:03,588
a seven-year-old boy
a lot quicker

863
00:46:03,655 --> 00:46:05,156
if we were working
on this together.

864
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:08,059
Well, what do you need me for?
You've just narrowed it down

865
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,994
by age and gender.
What else do you know?

866
00:46:10,062 --> 00:46:12,787
There are 40,000 seven-year-old
boys in this state.

867
00:46:12,822 --> 00:46:14,108
And how many
in Essex County?

868
00:46:14,143 --> 00:46:15,521
- 5,000.
- And how many in Paradise?

869
00:46:15,556 --> 00:46:16,871
About 67.

870
00:46:16,906 --> 00:46:18,580
Well, just find out
where they were born.

871
00:46:18,615 --> 00:46:19,920
You know,
you keep this up,

872
00:46:19,955 --> 00:46:21,206
you'll make detective
someday.

873
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:22,206
We don't have detectives.

874
00:46:22,274 --> 00:46:24,675
No, but if we did...

875
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,748
Be careful with that.

876
00:46:30,816 --> 00:46:32,150
- What is it?
- A letter.

877
00:46:48,567 --> 00:46:49,567
Mmm.

878
00:46:52,104 --> 00:46:54,138
Thank you for not wearing

879
00:46:54,206 --> 00:46:55,840
your stupid hat.

880
00:46:55,908 --> 00:46:58,643
The hat in and of
itself is not stupid.

881
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:00,144
Because?

882
00:47:00,212 --> 00:47:01,546
Because I designed it.

883
00:47:01,613 --> 00:47:05,745
Ah. Would you excuse us
for a moment, Alan?

884
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,654
(snaps fingers)

885
00:47:09,721 --> 00:47:12,089
Please.

886
00:47:17,229 --> 00:47:21,632
There, uh,
there might be

887
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,634
somebody...

888
00:47:23,702 --> 00:47:25,636
who works for somebody.

889
00:47:25,704 --> 00:47:28,239
Would the somebody
who works for somebody

890
00:47:28,307 --> 00:47:30,475
be involved in prostitution?

891
00:47:30,542 --> 00:47:32,043
Mm-hmm.

892
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:33,411
Teenage prostitution.

893
00:47:33,479 --> 00:47:36,481
I've heard you have scruples
about that.

894
00:47:36,548 --> 00:47:39,750
Where on earth would you get
such an idea?

895
00:47:39,818 --> 00:47:40,785
From Captain Healy,

896
00:47:40,853 --> 00:47:42,353
our gravely-wounded friend.

897
00:47:42,421 --> 00:47:44,155
He's not a friend.

898
00:47:44,223 --> 00:47:46,691
This...

899
00:47:46,758 --> 00:47:49,694
somebody... might hold a grudge.

900
00:47:49,761 --> 00:47:50,962
(sighs)

901
00:47:51,029 --> 00:47:52,296
Do you have a name?

902
00:47:52,364 --> 00:47:56,033
Oh, you do your job,
you'll figure it out.

903
00:47:56,101 --> 00:47:58,803
Everybody says that.

904
00:48:00,773 --> 00:48:03,341
You a Red Sox fan, Gino?

905
00:48:03,408 --> 00:48:05,109
When they're winning.

906
00:48:05,177 --> 00:48:07,979
Well, you know, the hardest
thing to hit is a triple.

907
00:48:08,046 --> 00:48:09,380
With your scruples

908
00:48:09,448 --> 00:48:11,482
about prostitution,
you give up drugs

909
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,050
and gambling...

910
00:48:13,118 --> 00:48:14,719
that would be a triple.

911
00:48:16,755 --> 00:48:19,490
You can leave now, Jesse Stone.

912
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:32,532
(indistinct chatter)

913
00:48:37,505 --> 00:48:40,160
(indistinct conversation)

914
00:48:53,588 --> 00:48:56,456
Talk to me.

915
00:49:00,795 --> 00:49:02,562
Sister Mary John.

916
00:49:04,932 --> 00:49:06,032
Jesse Stone.

917
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:11,538
You're a long way from Paradise.

918
00:49:11,606 --> 00:49:13,540
Why would you
remember me?

919
00:49:13,608 --> 00:49:15,842
You caught the killer
of one of my girls.

920
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,411
You're in my good book.

921
00:49:17,478 --> 00:49:18,879
- You have a bad book?
- Oh, yeah.

922
00:49:18,946 --> 00:49:22,082
I'm looking for
someone in there.

923
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,583
You want a coffee?

924
00:49:23,651 --> 00:49:26,119
I would never turn down
such an offer, Sister.

925
00:49:26,187 --> 00:49:27,554
<i>In my line of work,</i>

926
00:49:27,622 --> 00:49:30,657
I find it best to
be totally honest.

927
00:49:30,725 --> 00:49:32,325
I remembered you

928
00:49:32,393 --> 00:49:34,828
because I saw your
name in the paper.

929
00:49:34,896 --> 00:49:36,663
I'm hurt.

930
00:49:36,731 --> 00:49:38,231
This is about
the shooting?

931
00:49:38,299 --> 00:49:40,033
It is.

932
00:49:40,101 --> 00:49:43,036
Whoever did it was involved
in teenage prostitution.

933
00:49:43,104 --> 00:49:44,171
How do you know?

934
00:49:44,238 --> 00:49:45,405
I can't tell you.

935
00:49:45,473 --> 00:49:47,808
My girls aren't
always prostitutes.

936
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:49,142
I know that.

937
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,478
I think you're a good guesser.

938
00:49:51,546 --> 00:49:53,046
And you need a good guesser?

939
00:49:53,114 --> 00:49:55,482
I do.

940
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:58,085
I'm looking for someone capable
of conduct without conscience.

941
00:49:58,152 --> 00:50:01,154
And who runs a string of pimps?

942
00:50:01,222 --> 00:50:04,091
- That's correct.
- Bixy Chapelle.

943
00:50:04,158 --> 00:50:06,193
Bixy Chapelle is the boss.

944
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,062
I'm looking for a guy
who works for him.

945
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:11,498
Somebody who
likes to get even.

946
00:50:11,566 --> 00:50:13,333
Pauly Palmieri,

947
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:15,202
Teddy Leaf,

948
00:50:15,269 --> 00:50:16,603
Winston Monroe.

949
00:50:16,671 --> 00:50:17,938
How do you know?

950
00:50:18,005 --> 00:50:19,439
They're on my list.

951
00:50:19,507 --> 00:50:23,110
They've all had
girls disappear.

952
00:50:23,177 --> 00:50:25,178
(sighs)

953
00:50:26,447 --> 00:50:28,281
Thank you.

954
00:50:30,251 --> 00:50:33,220
I know you're a nun, but maybe
we could have dinner sometime.

955
00:50:33,287 --> 00:50:35,555
I'd like that.

956
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,863
I know you won't give him up,

957
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:44,898
but maybe you could
tell me who it isn't.

958
00:50:44,966 --> 00:50:46,800
Pauly Palmieri, Teddy Leaf,

959
00:50:46,868 --> 00:50:50,170
Winston Monroe.

960
00:50:50,238 --> 00:50:53,073
One and three.

961
00:50:59,781 --> 00:51:01,982
MAN: Hey, brother, you got
any spare change?

962
00:51:02,049 --> 00:51:03,750
No, do you?

963
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,653
How many quarters you got?

964
00:51:07,688 --> 00:51:09,089
Six.

965
00:51:09,157 --> 00:51:12,259
I'll give you five
bucks for them.

966
00:51:17,298 --> 00:51:18,765
You're welcome.

967
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:20,267
ROSE: <i>Jesse, where are you?</i>

968
00:51:20,334 --> 00:51:21,668
I paged you.

969
00:51:21,736 --> 00:51:23,136
- That was you?
- That was me.

970
00:51:23,204 --> 00:51:24,738
Councilman Comden dropped by.

971
00:51:24,806 --> 00:51:25,939
Oh, he's okay.

972
00:51:26,007 --> 00:51:27,274
How do you know?

973
00:51:27,341 --> 00:51:28,475
He likes movies.

974
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,743
Listen, is Suitcase there?

975
00:51:29,811 --> 00:51:31,178
No, he's out manning
the speed trap.

976
00:51:31,245 --> 00:51:32,679
Showing the flag.

977
00:51:32,747 --> 00:51:34,414
How's he doing?

978
00:51:34,482 --> 00:51:35,782
Well, he called me on his

979
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,517
cell phone and said he hasn't

980
00:51:37,585 --> 00:51:38,652
written a single ticket.

981
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:40,187
Does he know why?

982
00:51:40,254 --> 00:51:41,588
No.

983
00:51:41,656 --> 00:51:43,256
- Well, don't tell him.
- Don't tell him what?

984
00:51:43,324 --> 00:51:45,292
Never mind.

985
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:47,761
I took Doc Perkins
the names of all

986
00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:49,362
the seven-year-old boys
in the Paradise school system,

987
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:51,631
and he was at the birth
of every one of them.

988
00:51:51,699 --> 00:51:54,201
Small town.

989
00:51:54,268 --> 00:51:55,736
He said you brought
the subject up.

990
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,107
Hey, what about the
home-schooled kids?

991
00:52:00,174 --> 00:52:03,009
Well, how would you find them?

992
00:52:03,077 --> 00:52:05,679
I guess I'd have to talk
to the school board.

993
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:06,913
Yeah, their parents

994
00:52:06,981 --> 00:52:08,014
would need a permit.

995
00:52:08,082 --> 00:52:09,216
Carter Hansen's wife

996
00:52:09,283 --> 00:52:11,518
is chairman of the school board.

997
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,553
Do you want him to know
that we're investigating

998
00:52:13,621 --> 00:52:14,988
a seven-year-old
out-of-state kidnapping?

999
00:52:15,056 --> 00:52:16,790
You're investigating
a seven-year-old

1000
00:52:16,858 --> 00:52:18,725
out-of-state kidnapping.

1001
00:52:18,793 --> 00:52:20,961
You'll find a way, Rose.

1002
00:52:21,028 --> 00:52:21,962
(hangs up)

1003
00:52:22,029 --> 00:52:27,033
(saxophone playing slow tune)

1004
00:52:36,377 --> 00:52:37,644
(stops playing)

1005
00:52:40,648 --> 00:52:41,882
(Healy sighs)

1006
00:52:41,949 --> 00:52:43,417
Eileen thought
I was looking

1007
00:52:43,484 --> 00:52:44,918
a little peaked.

1008
00:52:44,986 --> 00:52:46,386
So, I'm taking some sun.

1009
00:52:48,823 --> 00:52:51,224
I'm like a character
in <i>Little Women.</i>

1010
00:52:53,394 --> 00:52:54,661
Oh, this is

1011
00:52:54,729 --> 00:52:56,863
my nephew, Michael.

1012
00:52:58,666 --> 00:53:03,136
Michael... he's on his way
to a saxophone lesson.

1013
00:53:03,204 --> 00:53:04,838
Pleased to
meet you, sir.

1014
00:53:04,906 --> 00:53:07,407
Jesse. You enjoying your
saxophone lessons, Michael?

1015
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,743
I'm learning a lot.

1016
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,278
I'll bet you are.

1017
00:53:11,345 --> 00:53:12,446
And he's getting

1018
00:53:12,513 --> 00:53:13,613
better and better.

1019
00:53:13,681 --> 00:53:15,949
You must have a good teacher.

1020
00:53:16,984 --> 00:53:19,986
Um, I should get going, um...

1021
00:53:23,591 --> 00:53:25,859
It's, uh, nice to meet you, sir.

1022
00:53:28,529 --> 00:53:29,930
You're, uh, blocking my light.

1023
00:53:37,305 --> 00:53:39,239
The IA lady came by.

1024
00:53:39,307 --> 00:53:40,707
Greenstreet.

1025
00:53:40,775 --> 00:53:42,309
She question you?

1026
00:53:42,376 --> 00:53:43,477
Yeah.

1027
00:53:43,544 --> 00:53:45,312
She's a babe.

1028
00:53:45,379 --> 00:53:46,980
I didn't notice.

1029
00:53:47,048 --> 00:53:49,282
You don't think
she's attractive?

1030
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:54,488
I heard a name: Teddy Leaf.

1031
00:53:54,555 --> 00:53:55,956
Thinks he's a tough guy.

1032
00:53:56,023 --> 00:53:59,493
Tries to prove it
by beating on his women.

1033
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:04,564
He once punched a kid
named Linny Dale

1034
00:54:04,632 --> 00:54:06,233
so many times,
her heart stopped.

1035
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,835
Did you nail him for it?

1036
00:54:08,903 --> 00:54:10,203
No, I didn't have enough.

1037
00:54:10,271 --> 00:54:11,438
I got him on a lesser.

1038
00:54:11,506 --> 00:54:13,173
Couldn't let it go?

1039
00:54:13,241 --> 00:54:14,775
Wouldn't let it go.

1040
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:17,711
You think he shot me?

1041
00:54:17,779 --> 00:54:18,812
Us.

1042
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,081
You think he shot us?

1043
00:54:21,149 --> 00:54:23,450
Hell, I have no idea.

1044
00:54:23,518 --> 00:54:25,585
For a while I thought
your nephew shot us.

1045
00:54:25,653 --> 00:54:26,753
It's just a guess.

1046
00:54:26,821 --> 00:54:28,889
It's a good guess.

1047
00:54:28,956 --> 00:54:31,024
One problem.

1048
00:54:31,092 --> 00:54:32,893
He's doing a nickel in Concord.

1049
00:54:35,463 --> 00:54:38,465
Okay...

1050
00:54:38,533 --> 00:54:40,634
Your bust?

1051
00:54:40,701 --> 00:54:42,302
My bust.

1052
00:54:43,337 --> 00:54:44,938
But then the Boston PD

1053
00:54:45,006 --> 00:54:46,406
would know that.

1054
00:54:46,474 --> 00:54:47,774
But a hot-shot sheriff

1055
00:54:47,842 --> 00:54:50,911
from Paradise wouldn't.

1056
00:54:50,978 --> 00:54:52,546
Leaf is a bad guy,

1057
00:54:52,613 --> 00:54:55,048
and you have no authority here.

1058
00:54:55,116 --> 00:54:56,650
I'm still

1059
00:54:56,717 --> 00:54:59,619
State Homicide Commander.

1060
00:54:59,687 --> 00:55:00,787
And I'm telling you:

1061
00:55:00,855 --> 00:55:02,456
Do not pursue this.

1062
00:55:02,523 --> 00:55:04,925
Hey, I'm just a small-town cop.

1063
00:55:04,992 --> 00:55:06,860
Mostly, I give out
parking tickets.

1064
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:11,031
I'm telling you
not to pursue this.

1065
00:55:21,342 --> 00:55:23,143
I have plans this evening.

1066
00:55:23,211 --> 00:55:24,945
This won't take long.

1067
00:55:25,012 --> 00:55:26,313
What makes you so sure?

1068
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,215
I need you to run
a name for me.

1069
00:55:28,282 --> 00:55:29,549
Is that all you need?

1070
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,952
No, but it'll have to do.

1071
00:55:34,255 --> 00:55:35,188
What's the name?

1072
00:55:35,256 --> 00:55:37,157
Teddy Leaf.

1073
00:55:37,225 --> 00:55:38,759
We already brought him
in for questioning.

1074
00:55:38,826 --> 00:55:40,093
I thought he was in Concord.

1075
00:55:40,161 --> 00:55:41,294
He got out on parole
a month ago.

1076
00:55:41,362 --> 00:55:43,764
(sighing): You take his shirt off?

1077
00:55:43,831 --> 00:55:46,166
No, just yours.

1078
00:55:46,234 --> 00:55:47,868
He came in
with his attorney.

1079
00:55:47,935 --> 00:55:49,503
He has an airtight,
triple-witness alibi.

1080
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,738
A family function.

1081
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,173
There's nothing we can do.

1082
00:55:53,241 --> 00:55:54,741
You could give me his picture.

1083
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,910
That's probably unethical.

1084
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:59,880
That hasn't stopped us so far.

1085
00:55:59,947 --> 00:56:01,748
You're a bad boy.

1086
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,617
I am.

1087
00:56:12,693 --> 00:56:14,594
SIDNEY: There's Teddy.

1088
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:17,731
Could you print that for me?

1089
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,471
And there's
haunts and associates.

1090
00:56:24,539 --> 00:56:26,540
Print that.

1091
00:56:41,923 --> 00:56:44,091
JESSE: That's illegal.

1092
00:56:44,158 --> 00:56:46,159
It's okay.

1093
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:51,965
I'm a doctor.

1094
00:56:54,235 --> 00:56:55,469
Great coffee.

1095
00:56:55,536 --> 00:56:56,803
Where do you get it?

1096
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:59,506
You're in my chair.

1097
00:56:59,574 --> 00:57:01,074
It's a lot better
than my coffee.

1098
00:57:01,142 --> 00:57:04,177
You want to wear my hat?

1099
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:09,416
Where you been?

1100
00:57:09,484 --> 00:57:12,252
Fighting crime.

1101
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,653
Where you been?

1102
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:16,289
Working on the shooting?

1103
00:57:16,357 --> 00:57:17,958
Yes.

1104
00:57:18,025 --> 00:57:19,326
Why are you here?

1105
00:57:19,393 --> 00:57:20,594
Did you find the trigger?

1106
00:57:20,661 --> 00:57:21,862
I got a name.

1107
00:57:21,929 --> 00:57:24,331
He's got an airtight alibi.

1108
00:57:24,398 --> 00:57:27,634
Airtight's where
all the fun begins.

1109
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:31,505
Guy's got two felony
convictions in LA.

1110
00:57:31,572 --> 00:57:34,674
I'd just get him on something
else and put him away for good.

1111
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,276
Why not here?

1112
00:57:36,344 --> 00:57:37,844
No three strikes.

1113
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,547
Two-time loser gets pinched

1114
00:57:40,615 --> 00:57:42,349
for anything more
than littering,

1115
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,985
and a judge can put him
away for a long time.

1116
00:57:48,055 --> 00:57:50,757
I spent a lot of time
in an office like this

1117
00:57:50,825 --> 00:57:52,192
when I was a cop.

1118
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,027
You miss it?

1119
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:56,897
Every day.

1120
00:57:56,964 --> 00:57:59,366
You could go back.

1121
00:58:02,236 --> 00:58:04,071
Toxic for me.

1122
00:58:04,138 --> 00:58:06,373
Me, too.

1123
00:58:08,409 --> 00:58:11,011
Nothing happens here.

1124
00:58:13,848 --> 00:58:15,182
You okay?

1125
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:24,691
You got plans tonight?

1126
00:58:24,759 --> 00:58:27,461
That don't involve
me and network TV?

1127
00:58:27,528 --> 00:58:29,096
Yeah.

1128
00:58:29,163 --> 00:58:30,230
No.

1129
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,399
I'll buy you dinner.

1130
00:58:34,702 --> 00:58:37,370
I'd like that.

1131
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:52,402
(children speaking indistinctly)

1132
00:58:58,108 --> 00:59:01,044
I'm taking you off
light ad, Suit.

1133
00:59:01,111 --> 00:59:03,079
You mean it?

1134
00:59:03,147 --> 00:59:05,014
Yes.

1135
00:59:05,082 --> 00:59:06,349
The town council okay it?

1136
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:07,817
They will.

1137
00:59:10,721 --> 00:59:12,321
How about a doughnut, Rose?

1138
00:59:12,389 --> 00:59:13,823
They're coply.

1139
00:59:13,891 --> 00:59:15,792
Jesse?

1140
00:59:15,859 --> 00:59:16,959
My body's a temple.

1141
00:59:17,027 --> 00:59:19,829
Clearly, you have transcended.

1142
00:59:21,231 --> 00:59:23,644
Suit, I need you
to do me a favor.

1143
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:24,449
Anything, Jesse.

1144
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:25,838
He's not here, Jesse.

1145
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:27,638
I talked to the school board.

1146
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:31,215
I told Hansen's wife I was thinking
of home-schooling my youngest.

1147
00:59:31,216 --> 00:59:34,016
She gave me all the names.
There are no seven-year-old boys.

1148
00:59:34,051 --> 00:59:35,745
There aren't even six
or eight-year-old boys.

1149
00:59:35,813 --> 00:59:37,080
Well, maybe you need to

1150
00:59:37,147 --> 00:59:38,681
expand the search.

1151
00:59:38,749 --> 00:59:40,350
Check seven-year-olds
in Swampscott and Beverly.

1152
00:59:40,417 --> 00:59:42,185
But the letter
was mailed from Paradise.

1153
00:59:42,252 --> 00:59:43,853
You've been looking
for someone who's here

1154
00:59:43,921 --> 00:59:46,255
in the second grade.
You need to be looking

1155
00:59:46,323 --> 00:59:48,491
for someone who was in
kindergarten two years ago.

1156
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,126
Because?

1157
00:59:50,194 --> 00:59:52,328
The only way I'd write
a letter like that would be

1158
00:59:52,396 --> 00:59:54,097
if I was moving,
leaving town for good.

1159
00:59:54,164 --> 00:59:56,866
If that letter was
postmarked two years ago,

1160
00:59:56,934 --> 00:59:59,235
you need to check
enrollment two years ago.

1161
01:00:01,438 --> 01:00:03,973
I need to go back
to the beginning.

1162
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:28,531
(indistinct conversations)

1163
01:01:03,867 --> 01:01:05,702
You showing
the flag?

1164
01:01:07,004 --> 01:01:09,205
They need to see you
in the trenches, Jesse.

1165
01:01:09,273 --> 01:01:10,640
I wrote four tickets.

1166
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:11,774
Four parking tickets.

1167
01:01:11,842 --> 01:01:13,476
Nothing at the speed trap?

1168
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:16,512
You know, there was a tree
in front of the sign,

1169
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:17,714
and somebody cut it down.

1170
01:01:17,781 --> 01:01:18,948
A vandal?

1171
01:01:19,016 --> 01:01:20,783
A police chief.

1172
01:01:20,851 --> 01:01:22,685
Okay.

1173
01:01:24,121 --> 01:01:26,055
This guy Teddy Leaf's
a real creature of habit.

1174
01:01:26,123 --> 01:01:28,191
He eats lunch at 12:00
at the same place every day.

1175
01:01:28,258 --> 01:01:31,294
And whoever drew up his
haunts list did a fine job, but

1176
01:01:31,362 --> 01:01:32,662
I added a timeline.

1177
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,497
That's good police work, Suit.

1178
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:36,699
I really appreciate this.
I feel like I'm all the way

1179
01:01:36,767 --> 01:01:38,701
back, Lou.

1180
01:01:38,769 --> 01:01:41,704
Just don't tell the town
council where you were.

1181
01:01:41,772 --> 01:01:44,007
Jesse, Eric Morton.

1182
01:01:44,074 --> 01:01:45,475
Born December 28, 2000.

1183
01:01:45,542 --> 01:01:46,709
Same day as

1184
01:01:46,777 --> 01:01:47,877
Adam Blue.

1185
01:01:47,945 --> 01:01:49,579
- Parents?
- Um...

1186
01:01:49,646 --> 01:01:50,813
Stephanie Morton, mother.

1187
01:01:50,881 --> 01:01:52,181
No father listed.

1188
01:01:52,249 --> 01:01:53,349
Is there a
work address?

1189
01:01:53,417 --> 01:01:55,518
I don't want to talk
in front of the kid.

1190
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:56,919
It could be just
a coincidence.

1191
01:01:56,987 --> 01:01:58,621
Cops don't like
coincidences.

1192
01:01:58,689 --> 01:01:59,856
You think he's alive.

1193
01:01:59,923 --> 01:02:02,558
I want him to be.

1194
01:02:04,828 --> 01:02:08,231
Did you draw me in,
or did I do it to myself?

1195
01:02:08,298 --> 01:02:10,833
It's just who you are, Jesse.

1196
01:02:18,976 --> 01:02:20,843
ROSE: Excuse me?

1197
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:22,345
- Are you Stephanie Morton?
- Yeah.

1198
01:02:22,413 --> 01:02:24,213
I'm Chief Stone, this
is Officer Gammon.

1199
01:02:24,281 --> 01:02:26,549
- Hi.
- Is there a problem?

1200
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:28,051
Do you own a green Dodge?

1201
01:02:28,118 --> 01:02:29,218
STEPHANIE: Yeah.

1202
01:02:29,286 --> 01:02:30,520
Have you used it today?

1203
01:02:30,587 --> 01:02:32,722
- No.
- What about lunch?

1204
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:33,890
I make my own.

1205
01:02:33,957 --> 01:02:35,291
I have a vegetable garden.

1206
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:36,592
Jesse, we don't need
to bother this...

1207
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:37,794
Excuse me, Rose.

1208
01:02:39,663 --> 01:02:40,930
Uh, a green Dodge was used

1209
01:02:40,998 --> 01:02:42,465
in the holdup
of a convenience store.

1210
01:02:42,533 --> 01:02:45,134
We didn't get the
license number, so

1211
01:02:45,202 --> 01:02:47,036
we're just checking every one
that we can.

1212
01:02:47,104 --> 01:02:49,539
Have you loaned your car
to anyone, Stephanie?

1213
01:02:49,606 --> 01:02:50,573
STEPHANIE: No.

1214
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:51,607
Is this your son?

1215
01:02:51,675 --> 01:02:53,643
Yeah, that's my Eric.

1216
01:02:53,711 --> 01:02:55,244
He's gorgeous.

1217
01:02:55,312 --> 01:02:57,213
Rose, do you mind?

1218
01:02:57,281 --> 01:02:59,882
Could your husband
have taken the car?

1219
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,417
I'm not married.

1220
01:03:01,485 --> 01:03:04,253
I-I-I... don't know
who Eric's father is.

1221
01:03:04,321 --> 01:03:08,057
I had a lot of issues
back then.

1222
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:09,525
Drugs and...

1223
01:03:09,593 --> 01:03:11,694
Eric changed all that.

1224
01:03:11,762 --> 01:03:14,630
From the first time
I held him in my arms, he...

1225
01:03:14,698 --> 01:03:16,899
Well...

1226
01:03:16,967 --> 01:03:19,569
listen, um, I don't think
there's anything to be

1227
01:03:19,636 --> 01:03:20,737
concerned about.

1228
01:03:20,804 --> 01:03:22,038
There's probably a hundred

1229
01:03:22,106 --> 01:03:23,439
green Dodges
in the county.

1230
01:03:23,507 --> 01:03:24,907
So, thank you.

1231
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:28,344
Nice to meet you,
Stephanie.

1232
01:03:32,816 --> 01:03:34,050
We could have
pushed harder.

1233
01:03:34,118 --> 01:03:36,085
If she thinks we suspect,
she could run.

1234
01:03:36,153 --> 01:03:37,553
Should we talk
to the son?

1235
01:03:37,621 --> 01:03:38,988
What's he gonna tell us?

1236
01:03:39,056 --> 01:03:40,356
We can't risk it.

1237
01:03:40,424 --> 01:03:42,058
Jesse, what if this
<i>is</i> a coincidence?

1238
01:03:42,126 --> 01:03:44,060
You take any
group of 23 kids,

1239
01:03:44,128 --> 01:03:46,329
and odds are, two of them
will have the same birthday.

1240
01:03:46,397 --> 01:03:47,730
You made that up.

1241
01:03:47,798 --> 01:03:48,998
- No, I didn't.
- How do you know?

1242
01:03:49,066 --> 01:03:50,333
I just know.

1243
01:03:50,401 --> 01:03:53,169
You know, if we're wrong
about this,

1244
01:03:53,237 --> 01:03:54,504
we damage a couple lives.

1245
01:03:54,571 --> 01:03:56,339
So, what are
we going to do?

1246
01:03:56,407 --> 01:03:57,840
Knock on doors.

1247
01:03:57,908 --> 01:03:59,042
Accumulate data.

1248
01:03:59,109 --> 01:04:00,209
But she did it.

1249
01:04:00,277 --> 01:04:02,011
She's the one.

1250
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,127
Last call?

1251
01:04:18,195 --> 01:04:20,163
I'm good.

1252
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:24,667
(quiet chatter,
pool balls clacking)

1253
01:04:26,103 --> 01:04:27,770
(indistinct chatter)

1254
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:29,005
(quiet laugh)

1255
01:04:49,893 --> 01:04:51,994
(water dripping)

1256
01:04:54,398 --> 01:04:56,399
(belt buckle clinking)

1257
01:04:58,135 --> 01:05:00,336
(toilet flushing)

1258
01:05:00,404 --> 01:05:01,904
(groans)

1259
01:05:03,073 --> 01:05:03,873
You shot me.

1260
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:05,208
Who the hell are you?

1261
01:05:05,275 --> 01:05:06,943
State Homicide.
Let me see your hands.

1262
01:05:07,011 --> 01:05:09,445
(panting)

1263
01:05:09,513 --> 01:05:10,713
I believe you know the position.

1264
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:13,716
(panting)

1265
01:05:15,252 --> 01:05:16,352
(grunts)

1266
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:18,855
You got a badge?

1267
01:05:18,922 --> 01:05:20,223
(grunts)

1268
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:21,924
(heavy breathing)

1269
01:05:21,992 --> 01:05:23,026
Yeah? So?

1270
01:05:23,093 --> 01:05:24,460
You armed?

1271
01:05:24,528 --> 01:05:26,396
No. That'd be a violation
of my parole.

1272
01:05:26,463 --> 01:05:28,631
(grunting)

1273
01:05:28,699 --> 01:05:30,033
You a little sore there, Teddy?

1274
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:31,401
I'm the one who shot you.

1275
01:05:31,468 --> 01:05:33,036
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1276
01:05:33,103 --> 01:05:34,704
You tried to kill my friend.

1277
01:05:34,772 --> 01:05:36,406
I've already been through this
with the Boston cops.

1278
01:05:36,473 --> 01:05:37,399
I saw you.

1279
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,062
And I have three people
that saw me elsewhere.

1280
01:05:39,097 --> 01:05:41,811
Well, I got a witness--
a reluctant witness--

1281
01:05:41,879 --> 01:05:43,780
but we got him on a drug charge.

1282
01:05:43,847 --> 01:05:46,282
He'll give you up.

1283
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:49,018
Just when things were going
so well for you.

1284
01:05:49,086 --> 01:05:51,487
I'll see you around, Teddy.

1285
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:55,091
(labored breathing)

1286
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,307
(knocking)

1287
01:06:10,279 --> 01:06:13,014
(children laughing nearby)

1288
01:06:16,084 --> 01:06:17,552
I'm here.

1289
01:06:17,619 --> 01:06:19,490
Oh. Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

1290
01:06:19,525 --> 01:06:20,700
Oh, it's no problem.

1291
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:23,100
Rose Gammon. Paradise Police.

1292
01:06:24,593 --> 01:06:26,594
(horn honking)

1293
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:31,032
(distant siren)

1294
01:06:35,604 --> 01:06:37,538
(sighs)

1295
01:06:46,348 --> 01:06:48,516
ROSE: We were told
that a green Dodge

1296
01:06:48,584 --> 01:06:49,851
was parked outside
all night long.

1297
01:06:49,918 --> 01:06:51,018
Could you verify that?

1298
01:06:51,086 --> 01:06:52,186
Oh, Stephanie's car.

1299
01:06:52,254 --> 01:06:53,354
Oh, sure.

1300
01:06:53,422 --> 01:06:54,755
It's always there.

1301
01:06:54,823 --> 01:06:57,124
How long have you
lived here, Mrs...?

1302
01:06:57,192 --> 01:06:58,459
Steinberg.

1303
01:06:58,527 --> 01:07:00,528
I've lived here forever.

1304
01:07:00,596 --> 01:07:01,729
(laughs)

1305
01:07:01,797 --> 01:07:03,097
Well, the green Dodge
was involved

1306
01:07:03,165 --> 01:07:04,732
in the holdup
of a convenience store,

1307
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,768
and we just wanted to be sure
that hers hadn't been stolen.

1308
01:07:07,836 --> 01:07:10,138
Hmm. Well, I don't sleep well.

1309
01:07:10,205 --> 01:07:11,806
It was here all night.

1310
01:07:11,874 --> 01:07:13,040
Okay. Good.

1311
01:07:13,108 --> 01:07:15,009
Thank you.

1312
01:07:15,077 --> 01:07:17,044
We already interviewed
Mrs. Morton.

1313
01:07:17,112 --> 01:07:18,146
She seems very nice.

1314
01:07:18,213 --> 01:07:19,780
Well, a freeze-dried hippy.

1315
01:07:19,848 --> 01:07:21,449
- Oh.
- But she, uh,

1316
01:07:21,517 --> 01:07:22,783
turned her life around.

1317
01:07:22,851 --> 01:07:24,652
How long has she lived here?

1318
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,254
Stephanie grew up in that house.

1319
01:07:26,321 --> 01:07:27,755
Her mother gave it to her
when Eric was born.

1320
01:07:27,823 --> 01:07:29,757
When was that?

1321
01:07:29,825 --> 01:07:31,425
Oh, six, seven years ago now.

1322
01:07:31,493 --> 01:07:33,427
I remember when she
brought the baby

1323
01:07:33,495 --> 01:07:34,996
home from the hospital.

1324
01:07:35,063 --> 01:07:36,397
I mean, from the airport.

1325
01:07:36,465 --> 01:07:38,599
I told her, you
don't go flying around

1326
01:07:38,667 --> 01:07:39,967
at Christmas as big

1327
01:07:40,035 --> 01:07:41,569
as a house.

1328
01:07:41,637 --> 01:07:44,071
But she went anyway.

1329
01:07:44,139 --> 01:07:46,808
Some nonsense about
it being her last

1330
01:07:46,875 --> 01:07:48,109
shot at freedom.

1331
01:07:48,177 --> 01:07:49,877
And sure enough,

1332
01:07:49,945 --> 01:07:52,446
in the middle of nowhere,
she goes into labor

1333
01:07:52,514 --> 01:07:54,015
and has the baby.

1334
01:07:54,082 --> 01:07:57,985
Can you remember where
in the middle of nowhere

1335
01:07:58,053 --> 01:07:59,287
was?

1336
01:07:59,354 --> 01:08:00,588
Somewhere out west.

1337
01:08:00,656 --> 01:08:03,658
Um, Colorado, Utah,
New Mexico.

1338
01:08:03,725 --> 01:08:07,395
Such a lovely boy.

1339
01:08:09,097 --> 01:08:11,098
(phone ringing)

1340
01:08:13,302 --> 01:08:16,137
I know you're married, but maybe
we could have an affair.

1341
01:08:16,205 --> 01:08:17,738
Jesse, it's her.

1342
01:08:17,806 --> 01:08:19,207
She had a baby boy
in Albuquerque,

1343
01:08:19,274 --> 01:08:21,976
New Mexico,
on December 28, 2000.

1344
01:08:22,044 --> 01:08:24,312
His birth certificate said
she named him Eric.

1345
01:08:24,379 --> 01:08:27,648
His death certificate said
he lived less than a day.

1346
01:08:27,716 --> 01:08:31,819
She put Adam's wristband
on her baby's body.

1347
01:08:31,887 --> 01:08:33,521
What do we do?

1348
01:08:33,589 --> 01:08:35,523
We've got to be careful.
The media gets a hold of this,

1349
01:08:35,591 --> 01:08:38,326
they'll see to it that the world
knows before Elizabeth does.

1350
01:08:38,393 --> 01:08:39,494
To me, that's backwards.

1351
01:08:39,561 --> 01:08:40,661
Jesse...

1352
01:08:40,729 --> 01:08:42,663
She's not going anywhere, Rose.

1353
01:08:42,731 --> 01:08:45,266
I need you to trust me on this.

1354
01:08:49,204 --> 01:08:50,771
I got to go.

1355
01:09:05,921 --> 01:09:08,389
(jackhammer buzzes nearby)

1356
01:09:13,962 --> 01:09:16,097
(dog barking)

1357
01:09:30,646 --> 01:09:33,381
(horn honking)

1358
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:58,105
(jackhammering continues)

1359
01:10:07,716 --> 01:10:09,650
(tires screeching in distance)

1360
01:10:36,612 --> 01:10:38,613
(garbled radio transmission)

1361
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:45,419
(distant siren wails)

1362
01:10:50,993 --> 01:10:52,293
JESSE: I need some help.

1363
01:10:52,361 --> 01:10:54,662
A Paradise town

1364
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:56,564
councilman called.

1365
01:10:56,632 --> 01:10:58,366
Some guy named Hansen?

1366
01:10:58,433 --> 01:11:00,268
He asked for my report.

1367
01:11:00,335 --> 01:11:01,803
Did you give it to him?

1368
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:03,137
No.

1369
01:11:03,205 --> 01:11:04,906
He also wanted to know
if you've been

1370
01:11:04,973 --> 01:11:07,074
using their cruiser on your
trips to Boston.

1371
01:11:07,142 --> 01:11:09,477
I don't have a car anymore.

1372
01:11:09,545 --> 01:11:10,645
They know that.

1373
01:11:10,712 --> 01:11:11,746
You're on thin ice, Jesse.

1374
01:11:11,814 --> 01:11:13,581
They're building
a case against you.

1375
01:11:13,649 --> 01:11:14,816
How do you know?

1376
01:11:14,883 --> 01:11:17,118
I'm Internal Affairs.
It's what I do.

1377
01:11:17,186 --> 01:11:19,620
He did it.

1378
01:11:19,688 --> 01:11:22,657
Leave him alone.

1379
01:11:22,724 --> 01:11:24,792
I know how you work.

1380
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:25,960
You set people up.

1381
01:11:26,028 --> 01:11:27,328
You're going to take him

1382
01:11:27,396 --> 01:11:28,996
in an alley
and shoot him?

1383
01:11:29,064 --> 01:11:30,431
Legally, we can't

1384
01:11:30,499 --> 01:11:31,632
touch him.

1385
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:32,834
I don't
operate under

1386
01:11:32,901 --> 01:11:34,068
the same constraints.

1387
01:11:34,136 --> 01:11:36,504
I got a friend in the hospital
passing blood.

1388
01:11:36,572 --> 01:11:40,041
You cross the line,
I'll put you away.

1389
01:12:00,395 --> 01:12:02,864
(garbled radio transmission)

1390
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:05,967
State Homicide.

1391
01:12:06,034 --> 01:12:07,135
I need a car.

1392
01:12:07,202 --> 01:12:08,336
Marked or unmarked?

1393
01:12:08,403 --> 01:12:10,338
Unmarked.

1394
01:12:10,405 --> 01:12:13,574
(tires squealing)

1395
01:12:14,943 --> 01:12:17,044
(engine revving)

1396
01:12:17,112 --> 01:12:18,946
(tires screech)

1397
01:12:28,056 --> 01:12:30,057
(rolling thunder)

1398
01:12:51,914 --> 01:12:53,714
Did you park in front?

1399
01:12:53,782 --> 01:12:54,916
Yes.

1400
01:12:54,983 --> 01:12:56,918
Could we go someplace
where it's dry?

1401
01:12:56,985 --> 01:12:58,920
No. Talk to me for a while.

1402
01:12:58,987 --> 01:13:00,288
Why?

1403
01:13:00,355 --> 01:13:01,856
I need you not to ask

1404
01:13:01,924 --> 01:13:03,057
- any questions.
- Why?

1405
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:04,659
That's a question.

1406
01:13:13,635 --> 01:13:15,670
I want you
to have plausible deniability.

1407
01:13:15,737 --> 01:13:17,505
- Why?
- I can't tell you.

1408
01:13:17,573 --> 01:13:19,006
- Why?
- Because if

1409
01:13:19,074 --> 01:13:21,275
I tell you, you can't
plausibly deny knowing it.

1410
01:13:21,343 --> 01:13:22,810
- But you know it.
- Yes.

1411
01:13:22,878 --> 01:13:24,445
- (sighs)
- Don't look around.

1412
01:13:24,513 --> 01:13:26,948
Do you have the two keys?

1413
01:13:27,015 --> 01:13:28,449
Yes.

1414
01:13:28,517 --> 01:13:29,517
Give me one.

1415
01:13:33,555 --> 01:13:35,156
(rolling thunder)

1416
01:13:35,224 --> 01:13:37,158
Now shake my hand.

1417
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:51,005
Okay... go to 3A
and use the key.

1418
01:13:51,073 --> 01:13:52,106
Where'd you get it?

1419
01:13:52,174 --> 01:13:53,808
From a saxophone
teacher.

1420
01:13:53,876 --> 01:13:55,910
Will the saxophone
teacher explain?

1421
01:13:55,978 --> 01:13:57,145
No, she's not there.

1422
01:13:57,212 --> 01:13:58,312
- Because?
- Because I don't

1423
01:13:58,380 --> 01:13:59,380
want her to be.

1424
01:13:59,448 --> 01:14:01,349
Turn on the lights
and leave.

1425
01:14:01,416 --> 01:14:03,384
Go out the front door,
get in your car and go home.

1426
01:14:03,452 --> 01:14:04,619
That's it?

1427
01:14:04,686 --> 01:14:06,020
That's it.

1428
01:14:06,088 --> 01:14:08,489
You don't want me
to stay for backup?

1429
01:14:08,557 --> 01:14:12,059
I want you to give me your word
you'll do as I asked, Suitcase.

1430
01:14:14,363 --> 01:14:17,098
You'll explain to me one
day, won't you, Lou?

1431
01:14:18,133 --> 01:14:19,867
Yes, I will, Luther.

1432
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:24,872
Oh.

1433
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:26,707
You have
any quarters?

1434
01:14:32,147 --> 01:14:33,815
Thanks.

01:17:05,067 --> 01:17:06,767
There's a guy breaking
into my building.

1441
01:17:06,835 --> 01:17:08,136
He's got a gun.

1442
01:17:08,203 --> 01:17:09,303
407 Arthur.

1443
01:17:09,371 --> 01:17:10,438
Help me, please.

1448
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:36,664
Hello, Jesse.

1449
01:17:36,732 --> 01:17:37,932
I've been

1450
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,100
expecting you.

1451
01:17:39,168 --> 01:17:41,335
Rose.

1452
01:17:41,403 --> 01:17:43,471
Did you find the green Dodge?

1453
01:17:50,112 --> 01:17:51,746
How long have you known?

1454
01:17:51,814 --> 01:17:53,881
Not long.

1455
01:17:53,949 --> 01:17:55,483
Why didn't you run?

1456
01:17:57,519 --> 01:17:58,586
Come in.

1457
01:17:58,654 --> 01:18:00,154
I want to show you something.

1458
01:18:35,157 --> 01:18:36,924
I don't expect you
to understand.

1459
01:18:38,727 --> 01:18:40,495
I devoted
my whole life

1460
01:18:40,562 --> 01:18:42,296
to Eric.

1461
01:18:44,299 --> 01:18:46,968
I left it just the way it was
the day he died.

1462
01:18:56,712 --> 01:18:58,846
You don't know, do you?

1463
01:19:04,019 --> 01:19:06,654
ROSE: "Thin Ice Kills Boy.

1464
01:19:06,722 --> 01:19:08,422
"Lewiston, Maine.

She sent that letter
the day after he died.

"Your child is loved."

1479
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:02,443
They were here,
hiding in plain sight.

1481
01:20:56,632 --> 01:20:58,800
You can only do
what you can do, Jesse.

1482
01:20:58,867 --> 01:21:01,302
It happened on my watch.

1483
01:21:03,539 --> 01:21:05,206
You got a registered letter.

1484
01:21:05,274 --> 01:21:06,407
I signed for it.

1485
01:21:06,475 --> 01:21:08,042
It's...

1486
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:09,710
it's from
the town council.

1487
01:21:09,778 --> 01:21:11,312
Read it.

1488
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:12,814
Read it out loud.

1489
01:21:14,283 --> 01:21:16,284
(envelope tearing)

1490
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:31,065
"This is to officially
inform you

"that you are suspended

Could you return these
to Captain Healy?

1496
01:22:30,859 --> 01:22:32,126
Um, what...

1497
01:22:32,194 --> 01:22:34,495
what did you get Teddy Leaf on?

1498
01:22:34,563 --> 01:22:35,897
Probably breaking and entering,

1499
01:22:35,964 --> 01:22:37,665
concealed carry,
parole violations.

1500
01:22:37,733 --> 01:22:38,866
Enough.

1501
01:22:39,968 --> 01:22:43,538
They... they want the
keys to your cruiser.

1502
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:50,878
I guess you two
will have to arrest her.

1503
01:22:50,946 --> 01:22:53,915
I'd consider it
a personal favor if, uh...

1504
01:22:53,982 --> 01:22:55,183
you could wait a while.

1505
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:57,084
How long's a while?

1506
01:23:00,222 --> 01:23:01,889
Till I call you.

1507
01:23:04,893 --> 01:23:07,228
She's not going anywhere.
