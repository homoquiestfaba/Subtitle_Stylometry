( Bird chirping )

5
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:20,027
God, why are you
punishing me?

6
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:33,640
Boy:
With red on his head,
he uses a gun.

7
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:35,909
With green on his chest,
he uses a sword.

8
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:36,843
Who is it?

9
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:42,348
Joey, we're not supposed to be
playing the prophet's game.

10
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:43,283
Adele!

11
00:01:43,316 --> 00:01:44,617
What?

12
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:47,453
"With red on his head,
he uses a gun...

13
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:49,988
With green on his chest,
he uses a sword."

14
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:53,492
-
what's the answer?
- I don't want to get
in trouble.

15
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:55,494
Come on, he's not here.

16
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:58,230
Elizabeth Taylor.

17
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:00,666
No, dummy.
It's a man.

18
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:01,500
Oh.

19
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:03,535
John Wayne?

20
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:06,872
No, Errol Flynn.
Remember "Robin hood"?
"Custer"?

21
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:10,441
Red player, you've missed
too many questions.

22
00:02:10,474 --> 00:02:12,176
You're out of the game.
( Clicks )

23
00:02:15,446 --> 00:02:17,114
Don't be a baby,
Adele.

24
00:02:17,148 --> 00:02:20,151
You can still be
the blue player,
and the green player.

25
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:23,020
I don't like this game.
It's too hard.

26
00:02:23,054 --> 00:02:25,189
No, it's not.
Come on, keep playing.

27
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:30,493
Joseph Matthew Highsmith,
what did I tell you
about that game?

28
00:02:31,728 --> 00:02:33,997
I told you to throw
that thing away, didn't I?

29
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,399
-
didn't I?!
- Yes, sir.

30
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:37,968
What's it doing out?

31
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:39,536
I just...

32
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:42,239
You thought you was gonna
get away with something.

33
00:02:42,272 --> 00:02:44,174
-
didn't you?!
- No, sir.

34
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:45,709
Don't sit there
and lie to me, boy.

35
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:48,378
I'll skin you alive.

36
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:50,179
( Whimpering )

37
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,015
Stop it, or I'll give you
something to cry about, Missy.

38
00:02:55,251 --> 00:02:57,653
Give me that game.

39
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:00,556
Give it to me!

40
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:06,061
When I tell you to do something,
you better damn well do it!

41
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:08,464
You think you're smart,
hiding this from me?

42
00:03:08,497 --> 00:03:10,398
You think nobody's
watching you?

43
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:13,167
God is
watching
you!

44
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:15,103
He's judging you
for your sins...

45
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:16,638
For this...

46
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:18,172
What the hell is this?

47
00:03:18,206 --> 00:03:19,474
What is it?

48
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:21,442
Idolatry, sir.

49
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,183
"Thou shalt have
no other god before me."

50
00:03:29,217 --> 00:03:32,085
And this thing,
it's evil.

51
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,057
Nothing but evil
will ever come of it.

52
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:42,095
This is it.
It's over.

53
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:45,098
No more!

54
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:47,000
No, stop it!
You're killing them!

55
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:49,002
You're killing them!
I hate you! I hate you!

56
00:03:49,036 --> 00:03:50,736
Why, you little...!

57
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,774
Mommy, make him stop!

60
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:13,391
Joseph... he's been hurt!
Let me go and look at him!

61
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:15,527
Do not coddle
that boy, Rose.

62
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,495
You're gonna lead him
on a path straight to hell!

63
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,165
No! He's a good boy,
Joseph!

64
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:23,134
It is your boy, Rose,
your boy.

65
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:25,236
He's a goddamned monster,
and everyone knows it.

66
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,305
And everyone knows
what he did to that dog.

67
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:29,541
No! He didn't
do that.

68
00:04:29,574 --> 00:04:31,775
He killed him, Rose.
He killed him.

69
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:33,811
He cut him
into pieces,

70
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:36,080
and stuck his head
on the fence post.

71
00:04:36,113 --> 00:04:38,349
Your boy.
Your boy, Rose.

72
00:04:38,382 --> 00:04:40,718
( Weeping )
No, it's not true!

73
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:43,687
What the hell
is he gonna cut up
next, huh?

74
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:47,558
I just wonder
what he's gonna
cut up next.

75
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:40,198
( Man: Playfully )
I'm gonna get you!
You better hurry...

76
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:41,833
Hurry, hurry!
You better hurry...

77
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:43,568
You better hurry...
uh-oh...

78
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:46,871
Where did she go?
Where is she, now?

79
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,175
Oh, oh, oh...
I got you!

80
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:53,243
( Child squealing
and laughing )

81
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:55,278
I got you.

82
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:04,287
Just a second, honey.

83
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:07,691
What's the matter?

84
00:07:07,724 --> 00:07:10,393
Oh, Vincent...

85
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:22,538
Oh, my god.

86
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:36,618
Do grandpa a favor...

87
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:39,254
Pick up all your toys
before daddy gets here,
all right?

88
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:40,955
-
okay.
- Okay.

89
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:43,258

The game has begun.

114
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:47,066
Who is this?

115
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:50,169
The time may have
dulled your mind, detective,

116
00:10:50,202 --> 00:10:53,138
but surely you remember me.

117
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:55,440
Did you get my postcard?

118
00:10:55,473 --> 00:10:57,408
Look, I don't know
what kind of joke

119
00:10:57,442 --> 00:10:59,143
you're trying
to pull here...

120

You don't believe?
Luna Wells does.

121
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:05,483
You may went to send
someone to fetch her.

122
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:08,820
-
she's ruining the carpet.
- Who the hell is this?

123
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:11,656
You'll have to find me
for the answer.

124
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:13,624
You know where to begin.

125
00:11:13,658 --> 00:11:15,892
I'll have them leave
the light on for you.

( Click )

127
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:32,042

of the police department.

128
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:34,745
I'm standing at the front yard
of the murder victim's home.

129
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,213
The LAPD has not yet commented
on the situation,

130
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:38,848
but one thing is for sure...

131
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:40,850
Luna Wells' murder
could not have happened

132
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:42,718
at a worse time for them.

133
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:44,687
A recent report
alleged corruption

134
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,555
and incompetence
within the department,

135
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:49,992
and resulted in the removal
of police chief Michael Devein,

136
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:53,496
and several other
top ranking personnel.

137
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:55,563
This has been
a very tragic evening.

138
00:11:55,597 --> 00:11:58,700
This is Carol Stone, Kady.
Back to you, Frank.

139
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:02,637
Yeah, we're watching
the news now.

140
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,206
-He left us your number.
- My number?

141
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,610
-
it was on her arm in blood.
- Oh, no.

142
00:12:08,643 --> 00:12:10,078
Why would he do that?

143
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:17,184
I don't know why
he would leave my number.

144
00:12:17,217 --> 00:12:19,553
We had a series
of these murders

145
00:12:19,586 --> 00:12:22,256
a few years ago, but...

146
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:24,992
We got the guy.

147
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:27,528
The number belongs
to a guy in Seattle.

148
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:30,798
- He's a retired detective.
- What's the connection?

149
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:32,633
He was the guy
that brought down

150
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,835
that serial killer
a couple of years ago.

151
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:35,835
"Little Jack"?

152
00:12:35,868 --> 00:12:38,738
Yeah. He seems to think
we've got a copycat.

153
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:40,173
He thinks?

154
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:42,175
You know the story, chief.
We don't exactly have

155
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,876
all of Luna Wells
down in the morgue.

156
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,145
I don't want anyone
to find out about it, either.

157
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:48,748
- Not until we're ready.
- I understand.

158
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:51,551
I don't want to be judged
on how you handle this, Walter.

159
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:54,520
This isn't going to turn
into some feeding frenzy
for the press.

160
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:56,955
I want this handled
quickly and quietly.

161
00:12:56,988 --> 00:12:58,123
Yes, sir,
we're on top of it.

162
00:12:58,156 --> 00:13:01,126
I've got the lab analyzing
trace evidence from the scene,

163
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,628
and we're checking to verify
if she filed any reports

164
00:13:03,662 --> 00:13:06,064
having to do with crazed fans
or ex-boyfriends.

165
00:13:10,602 --> 00:13:13,605
You're not going
to let me down, Walter.

166
00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:16,073
I'm the only reason
you're still here.

167
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:19,543
Chief.

168
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,215
Yeah, what is it?

169
00:13:24,248 --> 00:13:26,650
Captain, these just
came in from Seattle.

170
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,158
It gets worse.

171
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:03,919
It's not him.

172
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:59,104
Woman:
Alan, why are we not
registered at Robinson's?

173
00:14:59,138 --> 00:15:00,205
Did I or did I not
give you a list

174
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:03,709
of things to do two weeks ago,
and asked you to do it?

175
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:05,678
Yes, but listen...

176
00:15:05,711 --> 00:15:07,646
just protract the facts,
all right?

177
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,348
I was going to go down there
and register with them,

178
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:11,250
but Renee said I could
register online.

179
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:12,651
Uh-huh.

180
00:15:12,685 --> 00:15:14,887
What did you do
with that information?

181
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,789
Nothing.

182
00:15:16,822 --> 00:15:20,024
Look. You don't want
to get married? Fine.

183
00:15:20,058 --> 00:15:22,026
-
Barb, I'm doing it.
- ...Fine. With me.

184
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,163
Barb, I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.

185
00:15:25,196 --> 00:15:27,432
Barb, now, honey,
come here, sweetheart.
It's all right.

186
00:15:27,465 --> 00:15:29,667
Just calm yourself down.
Have a seat here.

187
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:32,870
I say uncle Lew's
going to take real
good care of you.

188
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:35,006
What do you want?

189
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,075
Nothing, nothing,
you just relax.

190
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:40,310
Barb...
Barbstress...

191
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:44,214
- Luna Wells.
- I know nothing.

192
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:46,116
Come on, Barb,
come on.

193
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:49,319
Did you see her?
What did he do to her?

194
00:15:49,353 --> 00:15:51,288
- I'm not telling.
- Come on!

195
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:53,123
- Barb, come on.
- I can't.

196
00:15:53,156 --> 00:15:56,793
Do you promise
not to tell a single soul?

197
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:57,828
Yes!

198
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:01,998
Oh, Lewis, you are
such a liar.

199
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:03,799
I love it
when you do that.

200
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,369
- He cut off her foot.
- Ohh! Ooh!

201
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:08,704
But you did not
hear that.

202
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:12,375
That has not been released
to the press... Lewis!

203
00:16:12,408 --> 00:16:14,710
- Alan...?
- What?

204
00:16:14,744 --> 00:16:17,980
- I don't hear you typing.
- I've got to check my email.

205
00:16:18,014 --> 00:16:20,448
See if I got my next clue
for "the prophet's game."

206
00:16:20,482 --> 00:16:22,751
By the way, Lewis,
you owe me 20 bucks.

207
00:16:22,784 --> 00:16:25,687
You missed 6 questions,
and you're out of the game.

208
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:29,824
We are so headed
for a divorce.

209
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:34,362
Wait a minute.
Wait a cotton-picking minute.

210
00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:37,198
What did you do, make a bet
with the other players, too?

211
00:16:37,232 --> 00:16:39,466
You're not getting
20 bucks from me.

212
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,869
You're the prophet,
that's why you keep getting
all the answers right.

213
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:44,838
Yeah, the loser's always
suspicious, isn't he?

214
00:16:44,872 --> 00:16:46,874
I did not get them all right.
I missed just this last one,

215
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:49,843
so did green, we were tied.
You, on the other hand,

216
00:16:49,877 --> 00:16:51,345
are out, and you owe me
20 bones.

217
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,781
I'm not paying you 20 bones.
I'm not paying.

218
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:55,849
It was not
an official bet.

219
00:16:55,883 --> 00:16:57,985
I didn't even want to play
in the first place.

220
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,253
I don't even know anything
about famous dead people,

221
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,789
which I clearly stated
when we started this.

222
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,191
Besides, I know
this is a scam.

223
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,461
Oh, yeah! Yeah, it's you
and Lyle, isn't it?

224
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,997
No, I'm telling you,
I don't know who the prophet is.

225
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,032
Well, it's obviously
somebody here on campus.

226
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,500
I mean, you're posting
all the answers on the board.

227
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,036
Why don't you just
email them back?

228
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,304
Yeah, Alan, why don't we
just email them back, huh?

229
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:21,773
Because that's what
the rules said. I don't know.

230
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,876
You don't know?
Why don't I just go
find Lyle, and ask him?

231
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,078
Hah? Hah?

232
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:29,815
Have a little conversation
with your scam buddy? Yeah.

233
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,084
It is just a game.
Will you relax?

234
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,252
The words
of a guilty man, Barb.

235
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,321
- I want my 20 bones.
-
Shut up, Alan.

236
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:39,857
- I want my 20 bones.
- Shut up, Alan.

237
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:01,978
Aw, come on...

238
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:22,531
TV:
And now our host,
Brent Moore.

239
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:24,133
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen,

240
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,434
this is Brent Moore.

241
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:27,236
We have got a great show
for you this evening.

242
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:29,571
Ms. Carol Collins is here,

243
00:18:29,605 --> 00:18:32,841
and Lidel Jones,
the king of country himself,

244
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,911
so stay right where you are...

245
00:19:19,953 --> 00:19:21,954
Man:
Ow-ww! Ugh!

246
00:19:21,987 --> 00:19:22,955
Alan...!

247
00:19:22,988 --> 00:19:27,092
Alan? Come on,
this is not funny!

248
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,062
Alan?

249
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:36,969
Oh, shit, that's great.
Son of a bitch.

250
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:41,973
Alan, come out.

251
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,543
Alan!

252
00:19:45,577 --> 00:19:48,012
Oh, man!

253
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:58,156
Yah-hh!

254
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:12,135
Hey, Renee.
What are you doing?

255
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,305
- Hey. Where's Lewis?
- He's not here?

256
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,074
No. Do you know
where he is?

257
00:20:18,075 --> 00:20:20,444
- I don't know.
- You live with him, don't you?

258
00:20:20,477 --> 00:20:23,446
I stayed at Barb's
last night.

259
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,683
I lent him my overhead sheets
for professor Hartwig's class,

260
00:20:27,717 --> 00:20:29,952
and he swore to me that he would
have them back today.

261
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:33,089
If you see him, tell him
he is in deep shit with me.

262
00:20:46,468 --> 00:20:49,104
Alan:
Lewis, you are
in big trouble.

263
00:20:49,137 --> 00:20:51,439
You are such...

264
00:20:58,246 --> 00:21:00,015
Lewis?

265
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:05,552
Somebody shut
the power off.

266
00:21:05,586 --> 00:21:09,356
So he comes down
these stairs, and...

267
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,725
I don't know,
tripped over
the coffee table,

268
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:14,161
and hit his head?

269
00:21:14,194 --> 00:21:15,362
No...

270
00:21:15,396 --> 00:21:19,166
No, this place was a mess.
Somebody would have called us

271
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:21,001
if he was in the hospital,
wouldn't they?

272
00:21:21,035 --> 00:21:23,002
Have you checked
your machine?

273
00:21:28,074 --> 00:21:31,077
( Beep )
Hi, honey, it's mom.

274
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,079
Will you please come over
early on Sunday?

275
00:21:33,112 --> 00:21:33,947
Your father thinks
he's going to set up

276
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,449
Nathan's swing set
all by himself.

277
00:21:36,482 --> 00:21:38,084
See you then. Bye, hon.

278
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:41,421
( Beep )
Hi, bro', it's Dillon.

279
00:21:41,454 --> 00:21:44,690
Rhonda says not to buy Nathan
any army toys for his birthday.

280
00:21:44,723 --> 00:21:48,026
Why don't you just pick him up
some lipstick, or a dress?

281
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,162
I'll see you Sunday.
( Beep )

282
00:21:52,431 --> 00:21:54,466
All right.
Don't panic.

283
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:58,670
Just relax.
Drink your beer.

284
00:21:58,704 --> 00:22:01,006
Somebody will call.

285
00:22:14,352 --> 00:22:16,053
What?

286
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,123
What is it?

287
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:24,728
It's my clue
for the prophet's game.

288
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,463
Let me see.

289
00:22:29,499 --> 00:22:33,169
"I am the creator.
I call the warriors together.

290
00:22:33,203 --> 00:22:35,271
I know the secrets
in the water.

291
00:22:35,305 --> 00:22:37,407
Are you afraid to die?

292
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,809
Or will you come again
with the king?"

293
00:22:41,177 --> 00:22:43,045
I don't know.

294
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,116
How does this guy know
where I live?

295
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:49,685
I don't know.

296
00:23:19,647 --> 00:23:21,682
( Glass breaking )

297
00:23:24,885 --> 00:23:27,287
( Telephone ringing )

298
00:23:29,256 --> 00:23:31,458
( Ringing )

299
00:23:34,895 --> 00:23:36,730
Hello?

300
00:23:36,763 --> 00:23:39,166
Detective swan?

301
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:40,600
Who's calling?

302
00:23:40,634 --> 00:23:43,636
Chief of police, Robert bowman.
I'm returning your call.

303
00:23:44,804 --> 00:23:46,372
I didn't call you.

304
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:48,340
Apparently somebody thinks
you should have.

305
00:23:50,176 --> 00:23:53,145
I don't know what you have on
your schedule for tomorrow...

306
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:55,281
But I'd like you come to
the station, if you don't mind.

307
00:23:59,752 --> 00:24:01,654
Chief:
What did you do
with the postcard?

308
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:04,856
I threw it away.
It didn't mean
anything to me.

309
00:24:04,889 --> 00:24:08,493
...until I got the phone call.

310
00:24:08,526 --> 00:24:11,262
Did he ask you to come?
Is that why you're here?

311
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:14,165
We didn't ask you here to pry
into your personal affairs,
detective...

312
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:17,268
But I assume that's why
he left your number behind.

313
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:19,571
Obviously, he's trying to get us
to make a connection

314
00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:20,772
with the "little Jack"
murders.

315
00:24:20,805 --> 00:24:23,274
Yeah, he's trying...

316
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:25,242
But we got that guy.

317
00:24:25,275 --> 00:24:26,076
No, you got
a guy.

318
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,378
It's not like
he made it to trial.

319
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:31,281
You said you were the only
person there that day,

320
00:24:31,315 --> 00:24:33,884
yet you claim that
you don't remember anything.

321
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:35,519
Is that right?

322
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:40,924
Yeah. Yeah.

323
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:43,227
You don't recall anything?

324
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,894
No, not really.

325
00:24:44,927 --> 00:24:47,563
I mean,
just bits and pieces.

326
00:24:47,597 --> 00:24:49,465
Not much.

327
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:53,236
I took a pretty good
blow to the head.

328
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:55,238
You're lucky
to still be here.

329
00:24:55,271 --> 00:24:56,506
Yeah.

330
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,742
I'm willing to go with the fact
that we're probably

331
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:01,911
dealing with a copy cat here,
but I'm curious, though...

332
00:25:01,944 --> 00:25:06,248
How did this Johnny-come-lately
find out about the game?

333
00:25:06,281 --> 00:25:08,316
It was a front page story.

334
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:11,253
They had it all in print.

335
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:13,388
...except the clues.

336
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:16,725
They were never really
published.

337
00:25:16,758 --> 00:25:18,193
Listen...

338
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:23,532
I think he left that message
for me to call you.

339
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,633
Now, that tells me
he wants you here,

340
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:27,601
and he knows
where you are.

341
00:25:27,635 --> 00:25:29,937
I'm certain he'll try
to contact you...

342
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,773
So, I'd like to run
a tap on your phone.

343
00:25:32,806 --> 00:25:34,542
I'd also like to bring you
into the station.

344
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:37,011
Strictly a desk job
for now.

345
00:25:37,044 --> 00:25:38,646
What do you think?

346
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:40,848
I think I'm retired.

347
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:43,317
Well,
sleep on it...

348
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,218
And I'll
call you tomorrow.

349
00:25:47,387 --> 00:25:48,988
Thank you.

350
00:25:49,022 --> 00:25:51,257
Thank you.

351
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:01,734
Bob, you can't be serious.

352
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,636
Jesus Christ, you know
what this guy did in Seattle.

353
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,772
So does he.
He doesn't have amnesia,
that's a line of shit.

354
00:26:06,805 --> 00:26:08,774
This guy is dangerous,
I don't want him here.

355
00:26:08,807 --> 00:26:10,075
That's exactly
why I do,

356
00:26:10,108 --> 00:26:13,011
and I want you
to keep an eye on him.
Get him a baby-sitter.

357
00:26:13,045 --> 00:26:14,546
Who the hell am I
supposed to get?

358
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,781
Find someone.

359
00:26:17,449 --> 00:26:19,651
What about that gal they
just shifted over from vice?

360
00:26:19,685 --> 00:26:21,753
Frances...

361
00:26:21,787 --> 00:26:24,323
Yeah, I could do that.

362
00:26:24,356 --> 00:26:26,290
I want you to make sure
she keeps him busy.

363
00:26:26,324 --> 00:26:29,260
I don't want a vigilante
on my street.

364
00:26:43,341 --> 00:26:44,909
( Telephone ringing )

365
00:26:47,877 --> 00:26:49,546
( Ringing )

366
00:26:52,983 --> 00:26:54,718
Hello?

367
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:56,987
( Gruffly )
How did it go
at the station?

368
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,688
Did they ask
for your help,

369
00:26:58,722 --> 00:27:01,391
or do they know
about your mistake?

370
00:27:01,424 --> 00:27:06,562
- I didn't make a mistake.
-
You made a ghost...

371
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:08,464
And I'm more powerful
than I've ever been.

372
00:27:08,497 --> 00:27:11,400
I see everything now.

373
00:27:11,433 --> 00:27:13,535
You will believe.

374
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:15,871
You're so much smarter
than they are.

375
00:27:15,904 --> 00:27:18,974
Use them to find me.

376
00:27:19,008 --> 00:27:21,410
I want you to.

377
00:27:21,443 --> 00:27:23,612
I'm looking forward
to seeing you again.

378
00:27:23,646 --> 00:27:26,114
Why don't you come
and see me?

379
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:29,751
That's not how
the game is played.

380
00:27:29,784 --> 00:27:32,987
You will have
to wait your turn.

381
00:27:33,021 --> 00:27:34,856
( Dial tone )

382
00:27:36,858 --> 00:27:39,060
The first game started
about 10 years ago,

383
00:27:39,093 --> 00:27:42,530
on a bulletin board at a junior
college in Cincinnati, Ohio.

384
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:46,099
From there it moved to Chicago,
Las Vegas, and then Seattle.

385
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:48,402
In the beginning
the police didn't realize

386
00:27:48,435 --> 00:27:50,771
that their local celebrity
murders were connected

387
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:52,539
to their missing persons list.

388
00:27:52,572 --> 00:27:55,475
Not even after they found
the first contestant gravesite.

389
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:57,611
Why? Well, there were no
similarities between them.

390
00:27:57,644 --> 00:27:59,546
All the celebrities
had a consistent M.O....

391
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:01,882
Severe beatings,
and excessive stab wounds.

392
00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:03,583
All the victims
were killed on the spot,

393
00:28:03,617 --> 00:28:06,018
and no attempts were made
to conceal the crime scene.

394
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:08,521
Each of the victims
was dismembered,

395
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:10,723
and those particular
body parts...

396
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:14,093
Well, they left the crime scene
with the killer.

397
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,128
Like Luna Wells.

398
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:18,397
Yeah, but the contestants
were different.

399
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:22,168
He kidnapped them.
He kept them alive for a while.

400
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,670
Apparently he wanted to form
some kind of a bond with them.

401
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,405
But he did eventually
kill them,

402
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:30,508
and this is where
they ended up. Right here.

403
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:50,594
When he started to surface,
the police realized

404
00:28:50,627 --> 00:28:52,629
that both sets of murders
were connected.

405
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:54,164
But by that time

406
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:56,633
Cincinnati had dubbed their
celebrity killer "little Jack."

407
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,535
"Little Jack the ripper."

408
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:00,971
The FBI issued
a generic profile...

409
00:29:01,004 --> 00:29:04,174
- White male, between 25 and 35.
-
Excuse me, captain?

410
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,642
Yeah?

411
00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:07,443
That's not the guy
we're looking for, right?

412
00:29:07,477 --> 00:29:10,213
This is a copycat, isn't it?
What's his profile?

413
00:29:10,246 --> 00:29:12,482
I wouldn't be surprised
if it was the same.

414
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,551
Captain, what about the game?

415
00:29:15,585 --> 00:29:18,554
Will it be the same?
Do we even know if there is one?

416
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:20,556
If he's really mimicking
"little Jack," yeah...

417
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,825
Probably it will
be the same.

418
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:25,461
This is how it will go.
There will be five contestants.

419
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:27,229
Each contestant
will have a symbol.

420
00:29:27,262 --> 00:29:29,865
They'll have a number
or a color.

421
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:31,867
More than likely it'll start
on a college campus,

422
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,236
somewhere out in the open,
because he needs to see

423
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:36,571
who his contestants are.

424
00:29:36,605 --> 00:29:38,607
He also needs to be able
to follow them.

425
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,875
The more he knows
about them,

426
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:41,543
the more he can
control them later.

427
00:29:41,576 --> 00:29:43,645
Needless to say,
we need to find them.

428
00:29:43,678 --> 00:29:47,214
We need to do it quickly,
quietly... and no press.

429
00:29:47,248 --> 00:29:49,950
You think he's already started
eliminating the contestants?

430
00:29:49,984 --> 00:29:52,987
I think it's possible...
more probable every day
that he's out there.

431
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:57,158
This gentleman in the back
is retired Seattle detective,
Vincent swan.

432
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:59,894
He worked the real McCoy.

433
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:02,630
Chief Bowen has asked him
to stay on, so he'll be in here

434
00:30:02,663 --> 00:30:04,231
with Frances to answer
any questions you might have

435
00:30:04,265 --> 00:30:06,767
about this
investigation, okay?

436
00:30:08,768 --> 00:30:10,503
That's it, folks.

437
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:27,586
Hi. I'm Vincent swan.

438
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:31,523
- Frances Aldobrandi.
- Nice to meet you, Frances.

439
00:30:31,557 --> 00:30:33,759
Please, don't call me
"Frances," please.

440
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,828
It's "Aldobrandi."

441
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:37,095
Okay.

442
00:31:06,357 --> 00:31:07,692
Aldobrandi?

443
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,263
Do you think you could help me
over here for a second?

444
00:31:13,296 --> 00:31:15,232
In a minute.

445
00:31:20,036 --> 00:31:22,606
Can't smoke in here.

446
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:27,677
This is L.A.

447
00:31:36,652 --> 00:31:38,621
Hey, mother superior...

448
00:31:38,654 --> 00:31:40,756
Print me out a missing persons
report, would you?

449
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:42,658
Have you got a lead?

450
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:45,361
Nah. Captain thinks
we might luck out interviewing
the families.

451
00:31:45,394 --> 00:31:48,730
You never know, one of them
might have been playing
the game.

452
00:31:49,898 --> 00:31:51,633
Right.

453
00:31:54,035 --> 00:31:56,704
How's it going there, chief?
You know how to run that thing?

454
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,609
Al, show him how to do it.

455
00:32:01,643 --> 00:32:04,579
- I'm busy right now!
- Come on, give him a break.

456
00:32:14,421 --> 00:32:16,723
All right,
I'm out of here.

457
00:32:16,757 --> 00:32:19,760
Got my cell phone
if you need me.

458
00:32:30,803 --> 00:32:32,638
So, what do you want
to know how to do?

459
00:32:32,672 --> 00:32:35,341
Well, I was trying
to pull up

460
00:32:35,374 --> 00:32:37,410
Luna Wells'
forensic report.

461
00:32:37,443 --> 00:32:40,012
You don't have
access to that.

462
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,716
How about the missing
persons report, then?

463
00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:45,985
You don't have access
to that, either.

464
00:32:46,018 --> 00:32:48,621
What do I have access to?

465
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,191
Solitaire.

466
00:32:54,192 --> 00:32:55,393
Oh, what's that?

467
00:32:55,427 --> 00:32:57,829
Card game.

468
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:04,002
I don't think I was
put here for this.

469
00:33:04,035 --> 00:33:06,104
I think I should be doing
something important.

470
00:33:06,137 --> 00:33:09,707
Frances, this is important.
Trust me on this, please.

471
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,675
But what can he do?

472
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:13,811
He can't have access
to anything.

473
00:33:13,844 --> 00:33:15,746
I told you I was going
to take care of you,

474
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:18,415
and you are going to take on
more of an active role.

475
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:20,451
But right now, I need you
in there with him.

476
00:33:20,484 --> 00:33:22,286
I need to know
what he's thinking,

477
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:24,221
I need to know
what his state of mind is.

478
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:25,255
Please.

479
00:33:31,728 --> 00:33:35,465
Aldobrandi:
"Oh, how art thou fallen
from heaven, o Lucifer."

480
00:33:35,498 --> 00:33:36,966
( Aldobrandi sighs )

481
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:45,074
He was clever,
don't you think...

482
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:47,810
-
for a monster?
- What?

483
00:33:47,844 --> 00:33:49,811
"Little Jack."

484
00:33:49,845 --> 00:33:51,680
I'm just reading
some of his clues.

485
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,986
They thought the answers were
all dead celebrities, right?

486
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:01,189
That's how
he tripped them up.

487
00:34:01,223 --> 00:34:02,758
When he switched
to live ones,

488
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,126
they were still looking
in the history books.

489
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,494
Yeah.

490
00:34:05,527 --> 00:34:07,863
You think they'd have
caught on eventually.

491
00:34:07,896 --> 00:34:10,731
Oh, they did.

492
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:12,500
But he had them
so scared,

493
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:14,902
they'd do anything
he wanted them to.

494
00:34:14,935 --> 00:34:17,338
The only reason
they found three bodies

495
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:19,106
instead of five
in the Seattle grave...

496
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,308
Is because
some kids found it,

497
00:34:21,342 --> 00:34:24,178
called it in.
Just luck.

498
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,451
I noticed a "swan"
on the list.

499
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:34,487
No relation, is it?

500
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:38,391
She was my daughter.

501
00:34:41,261 --> 00:34:43,129
Oh...

502
00:34:43,163 --> 00:34:44,864
I'm sorry...

503
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:49,202
I... didn't know.
They didn't tell me.

504
00:34:49,235 --> 00:34:51,437
It's all right.

505
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,248
I'm gonna go outside
for awhile...

506
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,752
And chomp on a cigar.

507
00:35:26,537 --> 00:35:29,207
Frances, you busy?
I need to see you
for a second.

508
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,875
Sure. Shall I bring
my notes?

509
00:35:30,908 --> 00:35:32,008
No. I need you
to run to Manny's

510
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:34,010
and grab some sandwiches,
we're starving in there.

511
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:36,780
- You don't mind, do you?
- No.

512
00:36:08,244 --> 00:36:10,513
It's "babysit."

513
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,015
"Baby-sit."

514
00:36:15,183 --> 00:36:16,851
Hyphen.

515
00:36:23,024 --> 00:36:24,859
Which file?

516
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:27,495
Missing persons
report?

517
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:29,531
"F-8."

( Dance music plays )

519
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:02,195
Swan:
Your daughter's name
was on...

520
00:37:02,228 --> 00:37:04,564
Our missing persons report.
Was there any trouble?

521
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,567
There wasn't any foul play
in her disappearance, detective.

522
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,002
She was trying to get away
from her ex-husband.

523
00:37:10,036 --> 00:37:11,904
He filed a report,

524
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,239
but I've spoken to her
on the phone since then.

525
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:17,275
She's fine.

526
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:19,044
Thank you.

527
00:37:26,351 --> 00:37:28,587
( Telephone ringing )

528
00:37:30,255 --> 00:37:31,523
Hello?

529
00:37:31,556 --> 00:37:33,057
( Altered voice )
Congratulations,
blue player.

530
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:35,960
You have reached
phase two of the game.

531
00:37:35,993 --> 00:37:38,395
What?
Who is this?

532
00:37:38,429 --> 00:37:40,397
Do you have
your answer?

533
00:37:40,431 --> 00:37:44,268
Lewis...?
Lewis, is this you?

534
00:37:44,301 --> 00:37:47,037
What is your answer,
blue player?

535
00:37:47,605 --> 00:37:49,907
Who is this?

536
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:52,976
Listen, kid, I don't know
how you got my number,

537
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:55,144
but don't call me at home,
okay?

538
00:37:55,178 --> 00:37:58,147
-
give me your answer,
blue player.
- I don't have one.

539
00:37:58,181 --> 00:38:00,083
I'm sorry, I've got too much
going on right now.

540
00:38:00,116 --> 00:38:01,951
I really don't have time
for this.

541
00:38:01,985 --> 00:38:03,152
Tell your dad,
or whatever...

542
00:38:03,186 --> 00:38:05,622
That "blue" is out
of the game, okay? Thanks.

543
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:11,160
Man:
He didn't give me an answer.

544
00:38:11,194 --> 00:38:13,996
You know what that means.

545
00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:17,099
Lewis:
No! No, please don't! No!

546
00:38:20,202 --> 00:38:23,005
- You think they enjoyed it?
- Oh, they loved it, Simon.

547
00:38:23,038 --> 00:38:25,540
Didn't you hear
the response?
I'm delighted.

548
00:38:25,574 --> 00:38:27,142
I'm delighted, too,
because, you know

549
00:38:27,175 --> 00:38:28,977
I have a book signing
on Friday,

550
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:31,747
and the Brent Moore show
on Tuesday,

551
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,447
and I am
a bit worried.

552
00:38:33,481 --> 00:38:35,383
Do you think
the American public

553
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:38,352
realizing that I'm nothing more
than a dull-witted Englishman

554
00:38:38,386 --> 00:38:41,455
with a very large garden
will affect my book sales?

555
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:44,458
Wear black, darling.
They will never know
the difference.

556
00:38:44,492 --> 00:38:46,327
Here's my husband now.

557
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,063
Good night, Simon.
Thank you so much

558
00:38:49,096 --> 00:38:50,731
for speaking tonight.
It was a wonderful time.

559
00:38:50,765 --> 00:38:52,767
My pleasure.
Good night, Kathryn.

560
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,967
Good night.

561
00:39:08,248 --> 00:39:09,983
Bloody hell!

562
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:37,108
Oh, this is rather
embarrassing.

563
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,810
You wouldn't happen
to know anything

564
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,778
about changing a tire,
would you?

565
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:43,181
There must be
some trick to it.

566
00:40:00,497 --> 00:40:01,331
( Heart beating )

567
00:40:22,852 --> 00:40:25,654
( Phone rings )

568
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:27,390
Oh, no.

569
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:29,825
Yeah, it's swan here.

570
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:32,695
( Man's deep voice )
Drive to the cultural center
in thousand oaks.

571
00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:34,863
You'll find a car
with a flat tire.

572
00:40:34,896 --> 00:40:37,665
It belongs to the author,
Simon Davenport.

573
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:40,201
If you look closely,
you will find Simon,

574
00:40:40,235 --> 00:40:42,470
although I doubt
you will recognize him.

575
00:40:42,504 --> 00:40:44,172
Why is that?

576
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:45,874
Are you stalling me, detective?

577
00:40:45,907 --> 00:40:49,177
How long does it take
to trace a call these days?

578
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:49,844
( Click, dial tone )

579
00:40:52,747 --> 00:40:55,482
( Knock at door )

580
00:41:02,322 --> 00:41:04,191
What are you
doing here?

581
00:41:08,162 --> 00:41:09,196
Listen, swan,

582
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:11,799
I want to talk to you
about what happened today.

583
00:41:11,832 --> 00:41:13,634
I don't want you
to think...

584
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:16,202
do you know your way
to thousand oaks?

585
00:41:16,235 --> 00:41:17,470
Yeah.

586
00:41:17,503 --> 00:41:21,541
Okay. We're going,
and you're driving.

587
00:41:34,253 --> 00:41:36,922
Jesus fucking Christ.

588
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:39,925
It's like a fucking
Wes craven movie over there.

589
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,594
Yeah, tell me
about it.

590
00:41:42,627 --> 00:41:44,196
He took his head.
Can you believe that?

591
00:41:44,229 --> 00:41:45,430
I know it.

592
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:47,632
Where's swan?

593
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:48,934
Over there,
looking at Davenport.

594
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:50,902
Get him
out of there.

595
00:41:50,936 --> 00:41:52,404
Why did you
bring him here?

596
00:41:52,437 --> 00:41:54,239
I didn't.
He brought me.

597
00:41:54,272 --> 00:41:56,707
What are we going
to tell the press?

598
00:41:58,576 --> 00:42:00,244
- We're not.
- What?

599
00:42:00,277 --> 00:42:01,345
Look, take his car

600
00:42:01,378 --> 00:42:04,315
and park it someplace where
it can sit for a few days.

601
00:42:04,348 --> 00:42:06,250
Let somebody on patrol
find it.

602
00:42:06,283 --> 00:42:08,185
Take his watch,
his wallet, his rings,

603
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:11,455
anything else that can help
identify him.

604
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:12,256
He's going in
as a John Doe.

605
00:42:12,289 --> 00:42:14,258
I wouldn't
do that.

606
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,227
Come here.

607
00:42:21,264 --> 00:42:23,466
I'm only going
to say this once.

608
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,268
You mind your own
fucking business,

609
00:42:25,301 --> 00:42:26,136
and don't you ever
second-guess me

610
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:27,504
in front of my team again,
you got it?

611
00:42:27,537 --> 00:42:29,339
I was just
going to say...

612
00:42:29,372 --> 00:42:31,407
no, I'm saying
that if the press
gets hold of this,

613
00:42:31,441 --> 00:42:33,343
they are going to have
a field day with it.

614
00:42:33,376 --> 00:42:35,645
Every goddamn psychopath
within 50 miles

615
00:42:35,677 --> 00:42:37,412
is going to be
taking potshots
at celebrities,

616
00:42:37,446 --> 00:42:39,414
and this town
will be shut down.
You understand?

617
00:42:39,448 --> 00:42:41,850
Look,
you got people here.

618
00:42:41,884 --> 00:42:42,951
What's going to keep
that paramedic

619
00:42:42,985 --> 00:42:46,221
from telling his wife,
and who's his wife
gonna tell?

620
00:42:46,255 --> 00:42:48,624
I wouldn't
do this, Walter.

621
00:42:48,657 --> 00:42:50,559
When internal affairs hears

622
00:42:50,592 --> 00:42:51,660
about this kind of thing,
you know what...

623
00:42:51,693 --> 00:42:53,295
are you threatening me?

624
00:42:53,996 --> 00:42:56,397
This guy is famous.
He's gonna be missed.

625
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:59,300
I'll handle it.
Keep your mouth shut.

626
00:43:00,768 --> 00:43:03,604
Somebody get this blood
cleaned up.

627
00:43:03,638 --> 00:43:05,673
Nothing happened here.

628
00:43:10,278 --> 00:43:11,479
You ready to go?

629
00:43:12,613 --> 00:43:14,248
Frances, get him
out of here.

630
00:43:14,282 --> 00:43:15,349
Yes, sir!

631
00:43:15,383 --> 00:43:16,983
Quit calling me
"Frances."

632
00:43:17,017 --> 00:43:20,253
He can't do this.
This is illegal.
He knows it.

633
00:43:20,287 --> 00:43:22,322
Are you backing him
in this?

634
00:43:22,355 --> 00:43:24,491
He's just trying
to buy a little time.

635
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:28,361
He's just...

636
00:43:28,395 --> 00:43:30,430
You know...

637
00:43:30,463 --> 00:43:34,334
Even good people make
terrible mistakes sometimes.

638
00:43:34,367 --> 00:43:37,803
Is that what he says to you?
That I made a mistake?

639
00:43:37,836 --> 00:43:40,039
No, I was just...

640
00:43:40,072 --> 00:43:41,907
I know what
your job is.

641
00:43:41,941 --> 00:43:44,843
You think you got to play
the game to get ahead?

642
00:43:47,446 --> 00:43:50,015
Let's just go.

643
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:51,550
No...

644
00:43:51,584 --> 00:43:53,485
I'll catch a cab.

645
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:57,388
Look...

646
00:43:57,422 --> 00:43:58,723
I don't know what you think
is going on,

647
00:43:58,756 --> 00:44:00,592
but I'm not
your confidante, okay?

648
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:03,294
You have something
to get off your chest?

649
00:44:03,328 --> 00:44:04,662
Go tell a priest.

650
00:44:04,696 --> 00:44:07,799
I have no intention
of risking my job for you.

651
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:13,671
( Giggling )

652
00:44:16,507 --> 00:44:18,008
( Phone ringing )

653
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:20,444
Stop, stop.

654
00:44:20,477 --> 00:44:22,412
( Ringing )

655
00:44:25,048 --> 00:44:26,350
( Ringing )

656
00:44:26,383 --> 00:44:27,451
( Barb yelping )

657
00:44:29,353 --> 00:44:31,421
( Ringing )

658
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,760
Hello?

659
00:44:37,793 --> 00:44:38,928
Blue player...

660
00:44:38,961 --> 00:44:40,563
You have forfeited
your answer

661
00:44:40,596 --> 00:44:42,565
for this round
of the game.

662
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:43,866
It will be marked
against you.

663
00:44:43,899 --> 00:44:45,334
Who is this?

664
00:44:45,368 --> 00:44:47,436
From now on, you will play
by the rules.

665
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:49,538
You have to finish the game.

666
00:44:49,572 --> 00:44:52,108
No! I'm out.
Okay?

667
00:44:52,141 --> 00:44:53,943
Lewis:
Alan, play the game.

668
00:44:53,976 --> 00:44:56,345
Lewis?

669
00:44:56,379 --> 00:44:59,080
Just play
the fucking game.

670
00:45:01,816 --> 00:45:03,518
Lewis, where are you?
I'm calling the police.

671
00:45:03,551 --> 00:45:06,354
No! Don't call
the police, Alan.

672
00:45:06,388 --> 00:45:08,857
Please...
he'll kill me.

673
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,993
-Just play the game.
-Where are you?

674
00:45:12,027 --> 00:45:13,662
I'm calling the police
right now.

675
00:45:13,695 --> 00:45:17,798
He's with me.
We are watching you, Alan.

676
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:20,868
I see you
in the living room,

677
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:25,406
I see you in the bagel shop
on your way to work.

678
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:28,475
I stood next to you
Sunday mornings at the gym.

679
00:45:28,509 --> 00:45:31,645
I know everything
about you, Alan.

680
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:35,149
Everywhere you go,
everyone you talk to.

681
00:45:35,182 --> 00:45:38,017
I will know
if you tell,

682
00:45:38,051 --> 00:45:40,720
and I will kill Lewis
if you do.

683
00:45:40,753 --> 00:45:43,589
-
do you understand?
- Yes.

684
00:45:43,623 --> 00:45:44,924
( Dial tone )

685
00:45:58,537 --> 00:46:01,406
There's nothing.
It's a bad address.

686
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,942
It's got to be a screen
for something else.

687
00:46:05,177 --> 00:46:07,479
Honey, you have
to go to the police.

688
00:46:08,513 --> 00:46:11,416
Barb, I can't.
He's gonna kill him

689
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:13,885
if he finds out
I've said anything.

690
00:46:13,919 --> 00:46:16,822
I'm gonna have to keep playing
until I figure out what to do.

691
00:46:16,855 --> 00:46:18,823
What is there
to figure out?

692
00:46:18,856 --> 00:46:21,859
Barb... will you just
let me think, please?

693
00:46:48,251 --> 00:46:50,820
( Muttering )
Game... oh...

694
00:46:50,854 --> 00:46:54,891
Alan? Can I tell you
a secret?

695
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,962
Simon Davenport
won't be speaking
on Friday.

696
00:46:59,995 --> 00:47:02,030
He's dead.

697
00:47:03,499 --> 00:47:05,501
They brought him in
last night.

698
00:47:06,902 --> 00:47:08,237
Why is that a secret?

699
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:11,140
Because...

700
00:47:11,173 --> 00:47:12,908
He was logged in
as a "John Doe."

701
00:47:14,276 --> 00:47:18,580
- Why?
- I don't know.

702
00:47:18,614 --> 00:47:21,015
He was decapitated,
but the police knew
it has him.

703
00:47:22,016 --> 00:47:24,185
Jody told me.

704
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,523
They didn't even
put him in the freezer.

705
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:31,159
They put him in a hot box
with some sand and dirt,

706
00:47:31,192 --> 00:47:33,594
so that he'd decompose
in his clothes.

707
00:47:34,562 --> 00:47:36,564
What for?

708
00:47:36,597 --> 00:47:38,766
I don't know.

709
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,200
I couldn't ask any questions.
If they found out

710
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:43,470
that Jody told me anything,
they'd let us both go.

711
00:47:45,138 --> 00:47:47,607
But there's something
going on down there.

712
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:50,510
Holy shit.

713
00:47:51,545 --> 00:47:52,512
Holy shit.

714
00:47:56,283 --> 00:47:59,119
Okay, okay...

715
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,522
Listen...

716
00:48:03,556 --> 00:48:06,859
"I am the creator.
I call the warriors together.

717
00:48:06,892 --> 00:48:08,828
I know the secrets
in the water.

718
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:10,262
Are you afraid to die?

719
00:48:10,296 --> 00:48:12,598
Or will you come again
with the king?"

720
00:48:12,631 --> 00:48:14,233
Now...

721
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,169
Look at these books
that he wrote. Match them up.

722
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:22,640
"I call the warriors together."

723
00:48:22,674 --> 00:48:24,843
"Gathering
of the tribes."

724
00:48:24,876 --> 00:48:27,612
"I know the secrets
in the water."

725
00:48:27,645 --> 00:48:30,281
"Dredge the lake."

726
00:48:30,315 --> 00:48:32,784
"Are you afraid to die?"

727
00:48:32,817 --> 00:48:34,786
"Fear of death."

728
00:48:34,819 --> 00:48:37,522
"Or will you come again
with the king?"

729
00:48:41,124 --> 00:48:43,227
( Together )
"The king shall rise."

730
00:48:45,195 --> 00:48:47,264
Simon Davenport
is the answer.

731
00:48:47,297 --> 00:48:49,700
He was not dead
when I got this.

732
00:48:52,669 --> 00:48:53,871
And listen...

733
00:48:53,904 --> 00:48:56,673
This is the clue
that I got before it.

734
00:48:56,707 --> 00:48:59,276
"A lady in scarves
comes not from the east...

735
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:01,811
Too fair of face
on their sands.

736
00:49:01,844 --> 00:49:04,614
She is the moon by which
the moth navigates.

737
00:49:04,647 --> 00:49:06,649
Yet, cast your eyes down.
She ends in deep waters."

738
00:49:07,984 --> 00:49:09,352
I don't know.

739
00:49:09,385 --> 00:49:10,286
Barb...

740
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,955
"A lady in scarves
comes not from the east"?

741
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:16,692
Who's got a CD out right now?
She wears veils in her posters.

742
00:49:16,726 --> 00:49:18,027
Luna Wells.

743
00:49:18,694 --> 00:49:20,795
This is the guy
that killed her, Barb.

744
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:24,032
That's why it's called
"the prophet's game."

745
00:49:24,065 --> 00:49:27,202
He's predicting
his next murder.

746
00:49:28,236 --> 00:49:29,638
Get it?

747
00:49:30,872 --> 00:49:33,041
He's telling us.
He's telling the players.

748
00:49:33,074 --> 00:49:34,776
He's giving us a chance
to save them.

749
00:49:35,777 --> 00:49:37,612
- We're calling the police.
- No, no, no, no.

750
00:49:37,646 --> 00:49:38,847
No.

751
00:49:41,749 --> 00:49:43,951
That's why he took Lewis.
So I'll be quiet,

752
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:45,986
and I'll keep playing.

753
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,621
- What is the point?
- It's winning.

754
00:49:47,655 --> 00:49:49,790
Maybe if I can win,
I will get him back.

755
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,892
What if you don't win?

756
00:49:51,926 --> 00:49:53,861
What then?

757
00:49:53,894 --> 00:49:55,829
Is he going to come
after you, too?

758
00:49:57,197 --> 00:49:59,400
He knows where
you live, Alan.

759
00:49:59,433 --> 00:50:02,302
You have to tell
the police.

760
00:50:02,335 --> 00:50:05,638
I will, I will, okay?
Just... not yet.

761
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:07,173
Let me play it out
for a while.

762
00:50:07,206 --> 00:50:08,308
I've only missed two,

763
00:50:08,341 --> 00:50:10,743
I'm in better shape
than most of the other players.

764
00:50:12,178 --> 00:50:13,680
How do you know?

765
00:50:13,713 --> 00:50:16,716
Do you know who any
of the other players are?

766
00:50:16,749 --> 00:50:19,419
They're all here on campus,
right?

767
00:50:19,452 --> 00:50:22,254
What if one of them knows
who the prophet is?

768
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,762
( Tower bell chimes )

769
00:50:43,074 --> 00:50:45,242
So just relax.
Everything's going
to be okay.

770
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:47,712
All right?
Okay.

771
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:48,879
I'll see you.

772
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,744
Prophet:
He resides in Seattle.

773
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:23,312
Your story begins there.

774
00:51:23,345 --> 00:51:25,347
Man:
Okay, Vincent swan.

775
00:51:25,381 --> 00:51:27,116
Like the bird, right?

776
00:51:27,149 --> 00:51:29,251
That is correct.

777
00:51:29,284 --> 00:51:30,686
I'm sorry, I didn't get
your name.

778
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,689
Hello?
( Dial tone )

779
00:52:06,787 --> 00:52:07,954
( Horn honking )

780
00:52:07,988 --> 00:52:09,923
Swan:
Mrs. Garcia?

781
00:52:09,956 --> 00:52:11,758
Before Jeff disappeared,
did he mention

782
00:52:11,792 --> 00:52:13,760
a game to you
that he was playing?

783
00:52:13,794 --> 00:52:15,962
Mrs. Garcia:
What kind of game?

784
00:52:15,996 --> 00:52:17,030
A trivia game,

785
00:52:17,064 --> 00:52:20,200
something that he would have
picked up somewhere.

786
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:21,868
You mentioned
that he was a student

787
00:52:21,902 --> 00:52:25,538
at Sierra vista
university?

788
00:52:25,571 --> 00:52:27,506
Yes...
I don't remember.

789
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,810
Once, he showed me
a little poem

790
00:52:30,843 --> 00:52:32,511
on an orange piece
of paper,

791
00:52:32,545 --> 00:52:34,146
but it didn't rhyme
or anything.

792
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,215
I thought it was for one
of his poetry classes.

793
00:52:36,248 --> 00:52:37,983
Do you still have that?

794
00:52:38,017 --> 00:52:40,019
No.

795
00:52:40,052 --> 00:52:42,854
But you think that he
got it at the school?

796
00:52:42,887 --> 00:52:45,290
Yeah, I think so.

797
00:52:46,825 --> 00:52:48,359
Thank you, you're very helpful,
Mrs. Garcia.

798
00:52:48,393 --> 00:52:49,994
Thank you.

799
00:53:11,248 --> 00:53:13,884
So, Jeff Garcia's wife...

800
00:53:13,917 --> 00:53:17,154
Said that he was playing
something on campus...

801
00:53:17,187 --> 00:53:19,289
When he disappeared.
This could be it.

802
00:53:22,192 --> 00:53:25,294
What were you doing
talking to Garcia's wife?

803
00:53:25,328 --> 00:53:28,464
Where did you get
the missing persons list?

804
00:53:28,498 --> 00:53:30,500
- Off the computer.
- Not yours.

805
00:53:30,533 --> 00:53:32,568
Who gave you
their password?

806
00:53:32,602 --> 00:53:34,203
I figured it out.

807
00:53:34,237 --> 00:53:36,372
What's the matter?
This could be a contestant.

808
00:53:37,206 --> 00:53:39,108
You wouldn't have
found this if it was.

809
00:53:39,142 --> 00:53:40,243
"Little Jack" would
have pulled it down

810
00:53:40,276 --> 00:53:42,278
before anyone had
a chance to see it.

811
00:53:44,446 --> 00:53:46,081
This isn't
"little Jack."

812
00:53:46,114 --> 00:53:48,216
Bullshit.
You know it is.

813
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,217
You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't.

814
00:53:49,251 --> 00:53:51,486
You came looking
for the right guy this time.

815
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,021
I got
the right guy.

816
00:53:53,054 --> 00:53:54,990
You don't have a fucking clue
who you got.

817
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,392
And you had no business being
up there in the first place.

818
00:53:57,425 --> 00:53:59,327
It wasn't your case.

819
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,996
They pulled you off it,
because they knew

820
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,564
they couldn't trust you
with the suspect.

821
00:54:02,597 --> 00:54:05,065
- That's not true.
- Why did he end up dead?

822
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:06,901
Don't sit there and tell me
that you don't remember,

823
00:54:06,934 --> 00:54:08,068
because I know that you do.

824
00:54:08,102 --> 00:54:10,471
Are you calling me
a liar?

825
00:54:10,504 --> 00:54:13,274
You were a cop, swan.
Your job was to uphold the law,

826
00:54:13,307 --> 00:54:15,042
not take it
into your own hands.

827
00:54:15,075 --> 00:54:16,377
You fucked that up.

828
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:18,179
You raced up to that gravesite

829
00:54:18,212 --> 00:54:19,914
before anyone else
had a chance to get there.

830
00:54:19,947 --> 00:54:21,916
When you found your daughter
was in it, you lost it,

831
00:54:21,949 --> 00:54:24,184
you went out and grabbed
the first person you could find,

832
00:54:24,217 --> 00:54:25,985
and you beat him to death.

833
00:54:26,019 --> 00:54:28,888
That's bullshit.

834
00:54:28,922 --> 00:54:31,224
That son of a bitch
murdered my daughter...

835
00:54:31,257 --> 00:54:34,427
And they knew she was dead
before I ever found her.

836
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:37,497
That's why they took me
off the case...

837
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:39,566
And that is
the only reason.

838
00:54:40,233 --> 00:54:43,169
Any department would
have done the same.

839
00:54:43,203 --> 00:54:47,339
Don't sit there like you've
got something over my head.

840
00:54:47,372 --> 00:54:49,641
Damn it, I almost ate it
that day.

841
00:54:49,675 --> 00:54:52,311
What do you want
from me, a medal?

842
00:54:52,344 --> 00:54:54,213
I thought they gave you
one of those

843
00:54:54,246 --> 00:54:55,647
before they booted
your ass out.

844
00:54:55,681 --> 00:54:57,683
I retired.

845
00:54:57,716 --> 00:54:59,451
Why is that?

846
00:54:59,484 --> 00:55:01,453
Did your friends threaten
to stop lying for you?

847
00:55:01,486 --> 00:55:03,455
Did they set that fire
to cover your ass,

848
00:55:03,488 --> 00:55:05,389
or did you do it
when you found out
you killed the wrong man?

849
00:55:05,423 --> 00:55:06,357
Which one was it?

850
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,559
I didn't set the fire.

851
00:55:08,593 --> 00:55:10,661
How would you know?
You don't remember.

852
00:55:12,263 --> 00:55:14,298
Aldobrandi,
get in here.

853
00:55:15,233 --> 00:55:17,535
- She didn't do anything.
- I'll make sure she doesn't.

854
00:55:17,568 --> 00:55:20,972
Now, your place
in my department

855
00:55:21,005 --> 00:55:23,307
is behind a desk, period.

856
00:55:23,341 --> 00:55:25,709
You are not to be
involved with anything

857
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:28,411
outside of that room,
do you understand me?

858
00:55:28,445 --> 00:55:31,181
Is anyone gonna meet
that kid?

859
00:55:31,214 --> 00:55:33,450
That is not
your business.

860
00:55:33,483 --> 00:55:35,252
If I find you anywhere
near that Marina,

861
00:55:35,285 --> 00:55:38,021
I will personally
shove your ass on
a plane back home.

862
00:55:38,054 --> 00:55:40,257
You got it?
That's it. Get out.

863
00:55:41,391 --> 00:55:43,193
Yes, sir?

864
00:55:45,294 --> 00:55:46,629
Close the door,
and sit down.

865
00:56:00,342 --> 00:56:01,243
Frances...

866
00:56:01,277 --> 00:56:04,146
I think it's time
we get you more involved.

867
00:56:10,184 --> 00:56:11,519
( Seagulls calling )

868
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:45,751
Lone white male, 5'8",

869
00:56:45,785 --> 00:56:47,353
blue jacket, baseball cap.

870
00:56:47,386 --> 00:56:49,622
Looks like he's waiting
on someone.

871
00:56:49,655 --> 00:56:51,724
All right, Frances,
you're in.

872
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:12,344
You wouldn't happen
to know where

873
00:57:12,377 --> 00:57:13,611
"the prophet's game"
is moored, would you?

874
00:57:16,314 --> 00:57:18,717
Simon Davenport
isn't missing, he's dead.

875
00:57:19,417 --> 00:57:20,452
( Wiretap )
He's been dead for a week,

876
00:57:20,485 --> 00:57:21,519
and the police have known it
the whole time.

877
00:57:21,553 --> 00:57:24,456
That's not a contestant.
Get the son of a bitch.

878
00:57:26,256 --> 00:57:29,059
-
which player are you?
- I'm blue.

879
00:57:29,093 --> 00:57:29,526
I'm blue.

880
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,501
Police! Stop!

881
00:57:42,873 --> 00:57:44,608
Goddamn it, swan!

882
00:57:49,512 --> 00:57:50,480
Officer down!

883
00:58:34,588 --> 00:58:36,190
Damn it!

884
00:58:36,223 --> 00:58:37,558
Sorry.

885
00:58:39,827 --> 00:58:41,328
Damn!

886
00:58:50,236 --> 00:58:51,604
( Phone ringing )

887
00:58:54,674 --> 00:58:55,642
( Ringing )

888
00:59:02,949 --> 00:59:05,251
( Gruff voice )
Hello, blue player.

889
00:59:05,285 --> 00:59:07,653
Do you have your answer?

890
00:59:09,188 --> 00:59:11,256
Tell me your answer,
blue player.

891
00:59:13,392 --> 00:59:15,594
You have an answer,
don't you?

892
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:18,697
I don't have it with me.

893
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:21,500
- Do you forfeit?
- No. No.

894
00:59:24,503 --> 00:59:26,738
Ryan...
Ryan Davidson.

895
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:30,541
Blue player,
you are wrong.

896
00:59:30,575 --> 00:59:32,376
( Dial tone )

897
00:59:34,312 --> 00:59:35,713
You motherfucker.

898
00:59:37,882 --> 00:59:40,818
- What happened?
- Nothing, I'm fine.

899
00:59:40,852 --> 00:59:41,886
- It was just stupid...
- What is it?

900
00:59:41,919 --> 00:59:43,721
No, no, no.
It's dumb.

901
00:59:44,755 --> 00:59:46,390
What the hell
are you doing here?

902
00:59:46,424 --> 00:59:48,458
What the hell
are you doing?

903
00:59:48,492 --> 00:59:49,326
You just lost
that contestant.

904
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:51,495
That wasn't a contestant,
goddamn it.

905
00:59:51,528 --> 00:59:53,497
Since when does
the LAPD

906
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:54,798
start running around
with their guns out?

907
00:59:54,831 --> 00:59:57,200
Chasing innocent
bystanders?

908
00:59:57,234 --> 00:59:59,236
What are you gonna do,
to shoot him for loitering?

909
00:59:59,269 --> 01:00:02,305
We don't kill
innocent people.
That's your job.

910
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:04,441
It was the guy.
He knew about Davenport.

911
01:00:04,474 --> 01:00:06,576
I could give any paramedic
50 dollars

912
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:08,244
and find out
about Davenport.

913
01:00:08,277 --> 01:00:10,312
Get your ass out of here.
I want you out.

914
01:00:10,346 --> 01:00:12,715
How long do you think
you will keep that a secret?

915
01:00:12,748 --> 01:00:16,552
You say one word...
one more fucking word,
and you're out.

916
01:00:16,585 --> 01:00:18,521
Fuck you!

917
01:00:18,554 --> 01:00:20,589
You son of a bitch,
you're off this case.

918
01:00:20,623 --> 01:00:23,592
Don't want to see you
anywhere near my people!

919
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,696
( Helicopter flying by )

920
01:01:02,396 --> 01:01:03,797
Are you okay, All?

921
01:01:05,365 --> 01:01:07,601
You think maybe you
should go see a doctor?

922
01:01:07,634 --> 01:01:10,536
No, but maybe you should
if the captain finds you here.

923
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:12,738
Nah, he wasn't serious.

924
01:01:12,772 --> 01:01:14,607
Don't bet on it.

925
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,309
Why? Did he say
something to you?

926
01:01:16,342 --> 01:01:19,612
No. God... what is it
with you two?

927
01:01:19,645 --> 01:01:21,047
You think you're breaking
new ground here,

928
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,915
going for each other's
throat all the time?

929
01:01:22,949 --> 01:01:24,684
I can rent that stuff
off any shelf

930
01:01:24,717 --> 01:01:27,753
at the video store.
Just get over yourselves,

931
01:01:27,787 --> 01:01:29,788
and quit trying
to drag me into it.

932
01:01:29,821 --> 01:01:32,424
Didn't bust my butt
for 12 years

933
01:01:32,457 --> 01:01:34,559
to make homicide
so I could end up a spy.

934
01:01:34,593 --> 01:01:37,495
- I'm a lousy spy.
- Oh, I know.

935
01:01:37,529 --> 01:01:38,964
You get great
sandwiches, though.

936
01:01:38,997 --> 01:01:41,700
Thanks.

937
01:01:41,733 --> 01:01:44,869
That's why I was there today.
He thinks I'm a double agent.

938
01:01:44,903 --> 01:01:46,671
He just wants to get
my loyalty back.

939
01:01:46,705 --> 01:01:49,707
And even if I can convince him
he never lost it,

940
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,575
he's never going
to trust me again.

941
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:54,645
I can talk to him.

942
01:01:54,678 --> 01:01:57,448
Oh, yeah!

943
01:01:57,481 --> 01:01:58,749
You defending me.

944
01:01:58,782 --> 01:02:00,384
He'll know
we're in cahoots, then.

945
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:02,886
Hey, are we?
Come on.

946
01:02:07,124 --> 01:02:08,791
I thought I told you
to get out.

947
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:10,860
What part of that
don't you understand?

948
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,662
I want to talk to you.

949
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:13,596
Get out.

950
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,365
Just give me a minute.

951
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,367
You got two fucking
seconds before I find myself

952
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,901
a good reason
to have you arrested.

953
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:20,870
You go ahead
and arrest me.

954
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,607
Cuff him.

955
01:02:24,641 --> 01:02:26,075
Back off, Princess.

956
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:28,778
You...

957
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:31,647
get your tap
off my fucking phone!

958
01:02:39,054 --> 01:02:40,856
Excuse me.

959
01:02:46,762 --> 01:02:49,563
( Country ballad playing )

960
01:03:12,652 --> 01:03:14,120
Mr. Jones, did you...?

961
01:03:14,154 --> 01:03:15,789
( Screaming )

962
01:03:19,759 --> 01:03:22,529
( Television )
Si no me hubieras
hecho El daño que...

963
01:03:36,642 --> 01:03:38,110
Oh, damn it.

964
01:03:39,111 --> 01:03:40,813
Damn it.

965
01:03:42,114 --> 01:03:43,882
( Phone ringing )

966
01:03:47,786 --> 01:03:49,021
What the fuck
do you want,

967
01:03:49,054 --> 01:03:51,522
you miserable
piece of shit?

968
01:03:51,556 --> 01:03:53,725
Prophet:
I was careless.

969
01:03:53,758 --> 01:03:55,560
I've ruined the surprise.

970
01:03:55,593 --> 01:03:58,830
Well, I got a surprise for you.
I'm out of here.

971
01:03:58,863 --> 01:04:01,499
You can play your little game
all by your fucking self.

972
01:04:01,532 --> 01:04:03,534
You can't leave now.

973
01:04:03,568 --> 01:04:05,136
We've almost
reached the end,

974
01:04:05,169 --> 01:04:07,805
and you're such an important
part of the game.

975
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:10,907
Why should I stay?
You haven't showed me
anything new.

976
01:04:10,941 --> 01:04:13,043
You're just a cheap,
knock-off,

977
01:04:13,076 --> 01:04:16,446
murder-of-the-month,
copycat killer.

978
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,949
Oh, you still
don't believe.

979
01:04:18,982 --> 01:04:21,184
What can I say?

980
01:04:21,218 --> 01:04:24,221
Say goodbye, you...

981
01:04:24,254 --> 01:04:25,756
Twisted fuck!

982
01:04:25,789 --> 01:04:28,825
She wore a silver class ring
with a blue stone.

983
01:04:28,859 --> 01:04:30,860
It wasn't hers.

984
01:04:30,893 --> 01:04:34,563
It belonged to a friend
who killed herself in '86.

985
01:04:34,597 --> 01:04:36,766
She never took it off.

986
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:38,868
She asked me to Bury her
with it.

987
01:04:38,901 --> 01:04:42,571
She thought it would be easier
for you to identify her.

988
01:04:56,584 --> 01:04:58,520
God...!

989
01:04:58,553 --> 01:04:58,987
Oh, my god!

990
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,925
Swan...?

991
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:07,195
Swan?

992
01:05:07,228 --> 01:05:09,597
Don't come in here, al.

993
01:05:11,165 --> 01:05:11,965
Are you all right?

994
01:05:14,234 --> 01:05:15,969
Swan, I want to talk
to you a minute.

995
01:05:17,871 --> 01:05:19,573
Why?
Did Walter send you?

996
01:05:19,606 --> 01:05:22,142
- Wearing a wire?
- No.

997
01:05:22,176 --> 01:05:23,944
Want to frisk me?

998
01:05:25,078 --> 01:05:27,548
Swan, I'm not
against you.

999
01:05:27,581 --> 01:05:29,583
I just want to know
what's really going on.

1000
01:05:29,616 --> 01:05:32,218
I want you
to tell me.

1001
01:05:32,251 --> 01:05:34,253
What you remember
about that day?

1002
01:05:39,058 --> 01:05:41,260
Where are
my fucking cigars?

1003
01:05:55,907 --> 01:05:58,009
You know what I remember?

1004
01:05:58,043 --> 01:05:59,878
Rage.

1005
01:06:01,847 --> 01:06:04,082
All-out fucking rage.

1006
01:06:04,115 --> 01:06:05,784
I see Nancy
in the grave...

1007
01:06:05,817 --> 01:06:09,054
And then I see him,
I think it's him.

1008
01:06:09,087 --> 01:06:11,989
I don't know, it's just
a picture in my head.

1009
01:06:12,022 --> 01:06:13,924
I don't know who he is.

1010
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:16,994
Then afterwards
there's nothing
left of him,

1011
01:06:17,027 --> 01:06:19,096
it's just a pile
of ashes.

1012
01:06:20,097 --> 01:06:22,066
Did you set
the fire?

1013
01:06:22,299 --> 01:06:23,968
I don't know.

1014
01:06:24,001 --> 01:06:26,036
Maybe I did.
Maybe...

1015
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:29,573
Maybe I knew
I had made a mistake.

1016
01:06:29,607 --> 01:06:32,542
Maybe that's why
it's never set right
with me.

1017
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:35,311
That was my "d" day.

1018
01:06:35,345 --> 01:06:37,947
I should have walked away
from there...

1019
01:06:37,981 --> 01:06:40,049
Knowing what
I'm made of,

1020
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:41,885
knowing what kind
of man I am.

1021
01:06:41,918 --> 01:06:45,021
I mean, I walked in there
thinking that I knew.

1022
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:48,157
But...

1023
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:52,928
I sure as hell
don't know now.

1024
01:06:52,961 --> 01:06:55,764
You really don't know
what happened that day?

1025
01:06:55,797 --> 01:06:58,000
I fucked up, Al.

1026
01:06:59,034 --> 01:07:01,069
I fucked up.

1027
01:07:02,337 --> 01:07:04,940
It wasn't him.

1028
01:07:04,973 --> 01:07:06,708
He was a perfect
substitute, though.

1029
01:07:06,742 --> 01:07:08,343
Nothing came up
on him,

1030
01:07:08,377 --> 01:07:11,079
nobody came to claim him,
he didn't work for anyone,

1031
01:07:11,113 --> 01:07:14,015
his landlord didn't
know who he was...

1032
01:07:15,116 --> 01:07:17,084
He just said
he was "weird."

1033
01:07:17,118 --> 01:07:20,121
That was enough for them.
Case closed, here's your medal.

1034
01:07:20,154 --> 01:07:22,990
But I didn't
deserve it...

1035
01:07:23,024 --> 01:07:24,992
Because it wasn't him.

1036
01:07:27,428 --> 01:07:29,230
Fuck!

1037
01:07:31,866 --> 01:07:33,967
Where the
fuck
are my cigars?!

1038
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:38,338
Here.

1039
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:43,076
Oh, great.
Thanks.

1040
01:07:44,377 --> 01:07:45,946
So...

1041
01:07:48,448 --> 01:07:50,283
I should have known.

1042
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:54,853
Actually, I knew
when I got the postcard.

1043
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:58,157
Yeah, I knew.

1044
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:02,294
I should have died
with that poor bastard.

1045
01:08:08,801 --> 01:08:11,170
Swan...

1046
01:08:11,203 --> 01:08:13,871
I can't say I know
how you feel,

1047
01:08:13,905 --> 01:08:16,741
I do know that everything
happens for a reason.

1048
01:08:16,774 --> 01:08:18,710
You just got
to have faith

1049
01:08:18,743 --> 01:08:21,145
that god is going somewhere
with all this.

1050
01:08:26,284 --> 01:08:28,119
Well, let me tell you...

1051
01:08:28,152 --> 01:08:30,955
how much faith I have
in god right now.

1052
01:08:30,989 --> 01:08:32,824
You don't have to.

1053
01:08:33,724 --> 01:08:36,026
I've got enough to carry
both of us for a while.

1054
01:08:37,828 --> 01:08:40,263
( Tearfully )
Don't you help me...

1055
01:08:40,297 --> 01:08:41,832
god forbid.

1056
01:08:42,833 --> 01:08:44,334
God forbid.

1057
01:08:45,202 --> 01:08:48,438
It's so hot.

1058
01:08:48,472 --> 01:08:49,773
Here.

1059
01:08:56,746 --> 01:08:58,347
How did you do that?

1060
01:08:58,381 --> 01:09:00,182
That's broke.

1061
01:09:03,052 --> 01:09:04,787
You're going to make
the same mistake you made
before...

1062
01:09:06,422 --> 01:09:08,224
If you continue this
on your own.

1063
01:09:11,293 --> 01:09:12,695
But...

1064
01:09:14,896 --> 01:09:16,364
You're going
to do it anyway...

1065
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:19,501
So I might as well
help you.

1066
01:09:19,534 --> 01:09:21,136
Listen,
you can't help me.

1067
01:09:21,169 --> 01:09:23,138
Don't argue with me,
goddamn it!

1068
01:09:23,171 --> 01:09:25,106
You need help.

1069
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:26,741
It doesn't guarantee
you're going to be

1070
01:09:26,775 --> 01:09:28,476
the one to catch the bastard,

1071
01:09:28,510 --> 01:09:31,946
but I don't see anyone else
out there rushing to your side,

1072
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:33,914
so I suggest
you just shut up,

1073
01:09:33,947 --> 01:09:35,883
and take whatever
you can get.

1074
01:09:35,916 --> 01:09:37,985
Does this mean...

1075
01:09:38,018 --> 01:09:40,287
That we're in cahoots, Al?

1076
01:09:42,356 --> 01:09:43,991
I'll call you tomorrow,

1077
01:09:44,024 --> 01:09:46,260
after I get out
of confession.

1078
01:09:47,261 --> 01:09:49,396
( Softly )
Thank you.

1079
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:51,198
Okay.

1080
01:10:21,393 --> 01:10:23,095
Here you go.

1081
01:10:23,995 --> 01:10:26,264
Internal affairs knows
something's up with Davenport.

1082
01:10:26,298 --> 01:10:28,166
So does the press.

1083
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:31,169
Jones' housekeeper is set
to talk about what she knows,

1084
01:10:31,203 --> 01:10:33,405
which isn't very much.
She can't even describe the guy.

1085
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:35,473
So what did he take?

1086
01:10:35,506 --> 01:10:38,175
He scalped him.
That's all I know.

1087
01:10:39,376 --> 01:10:41,078
Okay, well...

1088
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:43,314
Keep your ears
open, Al...

1089
01:10:43,347 --> 01:10:44,949
And...

1090
01:10:44,982 --> 01:10:46,851
Watch your back.

1091
01:10:46,884 --> 01:10:49,153
What are you
going to do?

1092
01:10:49,186 --> 01:10:51,255
I'm going to go back
and get that contestant.

1093
01:10:55,258 --> 01:10:57,894
Detective swan.
Have you heard of
"the prophet's game"?

1094
01:10:57,927 --> 01:10:59,929
Woman:
No, sir, I haven't.
I'm sorry.

1095
01:11:01,164 --> 01:11:03,800
Have you heard of a game
called "the prophet's game"?

1096
01:11:06,903 --> 01:11:08,805
Have you heard of a game
called "the prophet's game"?

1097
01:11:13,309 --> 01:11:15,911
I'm detective swan.

1098
01:11:15,944 --> 01:11:17,846
Have you heard of a game
called "the prophet's game"?

1099
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,549
- No.
- "Prophet's game"?

1100
01:11:20,582 --> 01:11:22,417
- Hi.
- Hi.

1101
01:11:22,451 --> 01:11:25,387
- Are you a detective?
- Yes, detective Vincent swan.

1102
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:28,023
My name is Renee.

1103
01:11:28,056 --> 01:11:29,858
Listen,
I have a friend.

1104
01:11:29,892 --> 01:11:32,895
He's also a T.A. Here,
and he was...

1105
01:11:32,928 --> 01:11:35,897
I've seen this game
that you're asking about.

1106
01:11:44,338 --> 01:11:46,140
Remember me?

1107
01:11:46,174 --> 01:11:48,142
I'm the guy
that chased you
yesterday.

1108
01:11:48,176 --> 01:11:49,510
Don't you know
you're supposed to stop

1109
01:11:49,544 --> 01:11:51,212
when a police officer
tells you to?

1110
01:11:52,213 --> 01:11:54,282
I can't tell you anything.
He's got my friend.

1111
01:11:54,315 --> 01:11:55,615
He'll kill him.

1112
01:11:57,184 --> 01:11:58,285
Have a seat.

1113
01:12:06,493 --> 01:12:08,361
So how did you
find the game?

1114
01:12:10,096 --> 01:12:12,065
On the Internet.

1115
01:12:12,098 --> 01:12:14,167
I got an invitation
to play.

1116
01:12:15,302 --> 01:12:16,402
I thought it was one
of my co-workers,

1117
01:12:16,435 --> 01:12:18,637
because we always posted
our answers here on campus.

1118
01:12:21,207 --> 01:12:22,675
I tried to track down
the email address

1119
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:25,010
after I found out
about Simon Davenport,

1120
01:12:25,044 --> 01:12:26,278
but it wasn't valid.

1121
01:12:27,279 --> 01:12:30,115
He's either disguising it,
or he cancelled it.

1122
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:33,886
How did you know
about Davenport?

1123
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:36,287
My fiancee is an intern
at county.

1124
01:12:38,122 --> 01:12:39,624
It's a long story.

1125
01:12:40,425 --> 01:12:42,493
But it doesn't matter.
I'm caught, right?

1126
01:12:44,195 --> 01:12:45,964
I knew I'd have
to come forward
eventually,

1127
01:12:45,997 --> 01:12:48,933
but I wanted to wait
until I was down
to my last clue.

1128
01:12:49,734 --> 01:12:52,170
He's my best friend.

1129
01:12:52,203 --> 01:12:53,938
I just couldn't
give him up.

1130
01:12:54,606 --> 01:12:56,273
I don't know
anyone else's plan.

1131
01:12:56,306 --> 01:12:59,610
I mean, I think
there are five of us.

1132
01:13:00,611 --> 01:13:03,513
I'm still in,
I think green is.

1133
01:13:03,547 --> 01:13:05,616
Orange was out
before Lewis.

1134
01:13:05,649 --> 01:13:08,285
Lewis was yellow.

1135
01:13:09,286 --> 01:13:11,421
Red's probably out now,
he only had one left.

1136
01:13:13,523 --> 01:13:14,524
They...

1137
01:13:16,459 --> 01:13:17,560
Are they gone, too?

1138
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:20,429
Yeah.

1139
01:13:20,463 --> 01:13:24,300
- Are they still alive?
- Yeah, I think so.

1140
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,235
Can you guarantee me
the prophet won't find out,

1141
01:13:26,269 --> 01:13:27,737
if I tell the police
what I know?

1142
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,972
No.

1143
01:13:30,373 --> 01:13:33,376
I can't guarantee you
that the police

1144
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,710
won't leak something.
To the press,

1145
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,678
but I can guarantee you
that I won't.

1146
01:13:36,711 --> 01:13:38,446
And if you want me
to stick it out with you,

1147
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,081
then you're going to have
to cooperate with me,

1148
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:42,284
which means that you
can't do anything,

1149
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:45,420
and you can't go anywhere

1150
01:13:45,453 --> 01:13:46,554
unless I say so.

1151
01:13:48,189 --> 01:13:51,226
If you have family here,
stop seeing them.

1152
01:13:51,259 --> 01:13:53,161
Your girlfriend, too.

1153
01:13:53,194 --> 01:13:55,563
I don't want him
catching you with anyone.

1154
01:13:57,298 --> 01:13:58,732
Now...

1155
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,069
How many clues...

1156
01:14:02,102 --> 01:14:04,038
Have you missed?

1157
01:14:04,071 --> 01:14:07,408
Three.
I have three left.

1158
01:14:07,441 --> 01:14:09,176
Three?

1159
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:10,644
Good.

1160
01:14:12,646 --> 01:14:14,982
Then we still have
some time.

1161
01:14:17,317 --> 01:14:19,352
You see,
each clue refers to a book

1162
01:14:19,385 --> 01:14:20,553
that Simon Davenport
wrote.

1163
01:14:20,586 --> 01:14:23,089
That's how I finally
figured it out,

1164
01:14:23,122 --> 01:14:24,524
but he was
already dead by then.

1165
01:14:25,725 --> 01:14:27,560
You can't
always be 100%.

1166
01:14:27,593 --> 01:14:28,661
The main thing is that...

1167
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:33,433
You've stayed in the game
this long, you're good at it,

1168
01:14:33,466 --> 01:14:35,468
you're going to buy us
a little extra time.

1169
01:14:35,501 --> 01:14:36,669
( Television )
Captain Mott,
is it true

1170
01:14:36,703 --> 01:14:38,537
that you have
Simon Davenport's body?

1171
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:40,105
No comment.

1172
01:14:40,138 --> 01:14:42,507
We know that these murders
run parallel to a series

1173
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:44,409
-
in five other cities.
- No comment.

1174
01:14:44,443 --> 01:14:46,678
Is it true that you contacted
the Seattle detective

1175
01:14:46,712 --> 01:14:48,780
who killed the suspect
in those cases?

1176
01:14:48,814 --> 01:14:50,449
No comment.

1177
01:14:50,482 --> 01:14:52,117
Isn't it possible then,

1178
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:54,653
that the suspect was a victim,
and not the true killer?

1179
01:14:54,686 --> 01:14:55,754
Yes.

1180
01:14:55,787 --> 01:14:57,755
That's not
what Vincent swan says.

1181
01:14:57,788 --> 01:15:01,359
Oh, boy.
I don't know a Vincent swan.

1182
01:15:01,392 --> 01:15:04,595
Who is Vincent swan?
That's the question
many want answered.

1183
01:15:04,628 --> 01:15:07,331
At the LAPD, Leah Sanders,
back to you.

1184
01:15:07,365 --> 01:15:08,566
( Knocking )

1185
01:15:08,599 --> 01:15:11,502
- Al?
-
Yeah.

1186
01:15:11,535 --> 01:15:13,037
Just a minute.
( TV off )

1187
01:15:20,643 --> 01:15:22,379
Detective Aldobrandi,

1188
01:15:22,412 --> 01:15:24,280
I want you to meet
the blue player.

1189
01:15:24,314 --> 01:15:26,149
Hi, Alan Joyce.
I remember you.

1190
01:15:26,182 --> 01:15:27,550
I remember you.

1191
01:15:27,584 --> 01:15:30,387
Wait till you see him
tackle these clues out.

1192
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:32,188
He kid really knows
what he's doing.

1193
01:15:32,222 --> 01:15:32,989
As a matter of fact,
we are gonna

1194
01:15:33,023 --> 01:15:35,291
beat the killer
at the game, huh?

1195
01:15:35,325 --> 01:15:37,127
I wouldn't put all
your faith on me, all right?

1196
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:40,095
Unfortunately,
you're all we have
right now.

1197
01:15:40,696 --> 01:15:42,498
Don't you worry,
you're going to do fine.

1198
01:15:49,171 --> 01:15:51,340
Oh, this will help.

1199
01:15:55,711 --> 01:15:58,546
"If there are 7,
I do 5.

1200
01:15:59,714 --> 01:16:03,418
If I do 5,
you see 10.

1201
01:16:03,451 --> 01:16:05,453
Point me in,
and point me out...

1202
01:16:06,454 --> 01:16:08,890
Make the 6 move.

1203
01:16:08,923 --> 01:16:10,691
I am no more."

1204
01:16:11,793 --> 01:16:13,795
It's got to be something
with numbers in it.

1205
01:16:13,828 --> 01:16:15,196
Yeah.

1206
01:16:15,229 --> 01:16:17,465
Have some kid...

1207
01:16:17,498 --> 01:16:19,599
Do a drop and run
to the station.

1208
01:16:19,633 --> 01:16:21,435
Maybe some of the guys
can get it.

1209
01:16:21,468 --> 01:16:24,137
Hey, guys?

1210
01:16:24,171 --> 01:16:25,672
Come here.

1211
01:16:25,705 --> 01:16:27,641
( Man humming )

all day.

You guys have a puzzle?

1223
01:16:53,599 --> 01:16:54,800
Yeah.

You know, there's never been
one I can't solve.

1226
01:16:58,604 --> 01:17:00,805
There's a standing offer
in Europe, right?

no original thoughts.

If you guys want
to solve the problem...

1234
01:17:20,724 --> 01:17:23,494
You've got to start
thinking like the thinker.

1235
01:17:24,461 --> 01:17:27,264

You're doing fine.

I can do it,
I'm just...

1242

Okay, go ahead.

01:18:42,669 --> 01:18:44,571
Just be calm, come on.

1253
01:18:44,604 --> 01:18:45,738
All right.

1254
01:18:47,674 --> 01:18:49,676
Hello?

1255
01:18:49,709 --> 01:18:52,545
Hello, blue player.
Do you have your answer?

1256
01:18:52,579 --> 01:18:55,882
Yes, but I want to speak
to Lewis first.

1257
01:18:55,915 --> 01:18:59,018
I won't ask you again.

1258

Ethan Forrester.

1259
01:19:05,757 --> 01:19:08,393
Blue player,
you are wrong.

1260
01:19:09,394 --> 01:19:10,462
Oh, shit!

1261
01:19:12,564 --> 01:19:15,067
You did the best
you could, okay?

1262
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:16,702
No, I didn't.

1263
01:19:17,436 --> 01:19:19,638
Wait a second.

1264
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:21,706
I can't do this.

1265
01:19:21,739 --> 01:19:23,841
Who am I kidding?
I can't solve these clues.

1266
01:19:23,874 --> 01:19:26,744
Of course you can.
You did it before.

1267
01:19:26,777 --> 01:19:28,346
No, I didn't.
I cheated.

1268
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:30,948
What?

1269
01:19:30,982 --> 01:19:34,385
I stole green player's answers.
He always got them right.

1270
01:19:34,418 --> 01:19:35,853
I would just wait
till he put his up,

1271
01:19:35,886 --> 01:19:37,021
and then I would
copy them down.

1272
01:19:37,054 --> 01:19:39,390
Why would you do that?

1273
01:19:39,423 --> 01:19:40,957
Because I didn't have
any time.

1274
01:19:40,991 --> 01:19:44,094
It was just a running joke.
I only played to tease Lewis,

1275
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:46,329
and I didn't want
to spoil it.

1276
01:19:47,831 --> 01:19:49,799
I wouldn't be here now
if I hadn't cheated,

1277
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:50,800
I'd be where he is.

1278
01:19:50,834 --> 01:19:53,803
Why in the hell didn't you
tell me that before?

1279
01:19:53,837 --> 01:19:55,672
The only reason you didn't
make me come forward,

1280
01:19:55,705 --> 01:19:58,408
is because you thought
I could buy you time, right?

1281
01:19:58,441 --> 01:19:59,709
I know I'm doing
a shitty job,

1282
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,877
but I'm keeping
my best friend alive.

1283
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:04,446
- I'm trying.
- Okay.

ridiculous.

24 hours in a day.

1294

a moment to think?

Hello?

1300
01:20:49,756 --> 01:20:52,726
He is with you, Alan.

1301
01:20:52,759 --> 01:20:54,161
Who?

1302
01:20:54,194 --> 01:20:55,962
If you think it will affect
the outcome of the game,

1303
01:20:55,996 --> 01:20:58,632
you are both wrong.

1304
01:20:58,665 --> 01:21:00,067
I am the one
who determines

1305
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,901
who lives and dies.

your next round of the game.

01:21:05,705 --> 01:21:06,605
No. No.
Wait, wait, wait.

1308
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:08,407

I just...

1309
01:21:08,441 --> 01:21:10,142
shit.
Shit!

1310
01:21:10,176 --> 01:21:11,711
Hey...

1311
01:21:11,744 --> 01:21:15,047
- Calm down.
- No, you calm down!

1312
01:21:15,081 --> 01:21:17,116
It's not anyone you care about
that he's got, it's my friend.

1313
01:21:17,149 --> 01:21:19,051
If he dies,
it's your fault.

1314
01:21:19,085 --> 01:21:20,820
You said
he wouldn't find out.

1315
01:21:20,853 --> 01:21:22,854
I said I wouldn't tell
the press.

1316
01:21:22,887 --> 01:21:24,889
Well, is Lewis still alive?

1317
01:21:26,591 --> 01:21:29,127
He isn't, is he?
He's already killed him.

1318
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,895
Tell me.

1319
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:33,865
Well, I don't know.
Probably.

1320
01:21:33,898 --> 01:21:36,901
Then why the fuck
am I playing?

1321
01:21:36,935 --> 01:21:40,071
This guy has got more cards up
his sleeve than you know about,

1322
01:21:40,105 --> 01:21:41,740
and if he thinks
that you're on

1323
01:21:41,773 --> 01:21:44,508
to what he did
to your friend...

1324
01:21:44,541 --> 01:21:46,143
Things are only gonna get
worse for you.

1325
01:21:46,176 --> 01:21:47,978
They can't get any worse.

1326
01:21:48,011 --> 01:21:49,780
Oh, yes,
they can.

1327
01:21:51,815 --> 01:21:54,118
Where are you going?

1328
01:21:54,151 --> 01:21:56,019
Going out.

1329
01:21:56,053 --> 01:21:58,489
No, you're not.

1330
01:21:58,522 --> 01:22:00,190
Why not?

1331
01:22:00,224 --> 01:22:02,125
He's not coming after me
tonight. You know it.

1332
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:03,926
Why don't you go on back
to your motel?

1333
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,995
You don't want
to miss his call.

1334
01:22:09,732 --> 01:22:11,467
I've got to tell you,
we're not getting

1335
01:22:11,501 --> 01:22:13,569
the full story
from the LAPD.

1336
01:22:13,603 --> 01:22:16,806
Are you saying that the LAPD
is involved in a coverup here?

1337
01:22:16,839 --> 01:22:20,977
Brent, I think the cops
have Simon Davenport's body,

1338
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:22,811
and the reason
they are hiding it

1339
01:22:22,844 --> 01:22:23,812
is because they don't
want us to know

1340
01:22:23,845 --> 01:22:25,914
that there is a serial killer
in our midst,

1341
01:22:25,947 --> 01:22:28,550
and it's not just
any serial killer,

1342
01:22:28,583 --> 01:22:30,085
it's "little Jack."

1343
01:22:30,952 --> 01:22:32,788
Does Vincent swan
agree with this?

1344
01:22:32,821 --> 01:22:34,089
Vincent swan
wouldn't be here

1345
01:22:34,122 --> 01:22:35,690
unless he knew
he made a mistake,

1346
01:22:35,724 --> 01:22:36,892
and he may well
have known all along,

1347
01:22:36,925 --> 01:22:40,829
which is why he was probably
the one that started that fire.

1348
01:22:40,862 --> 01:22:43,564
Come on.
He was covering
his proverbial ass.

1349
01:22:45,032 --> 01:22:46,934
I couldn't have said it
any better myself.

1350
01:22:46,967 --> 01:22:48,602
We'll be back.

01:25:13,073 --> 01:25:15,008
He thinks I gave you
the clue.

1384
01:25:15,042 --> 01:25:16,743
( Chuckling )

1385
01:25:16,777 --> 01:25:19,046
He doesn't know
whether to give me
a medal or suspend me.

1386
01:25:20,047 --> 01:25:22,416
Well, he'll do it.

1387
01:25:22,449 --> 01:25:25,985
-
back off for a while.
- No, he won't do it.

1388
01:25:26,018 --> 01:25:28,654
He needs all the feathers
in his cap he can get.

1389
01:25:28,688 --> 01:25:30,723
Internal affairs
is closing in on him.

1390
01:25:30,756 --> 01:25:33,292
Even chief bowman
won't return his calls.

1391
01:25:33,326 --> 01:25:36,195
I'm telling you...
Don't push your luck.

1392
01:25:36,228 --> 01:25:38,130
Too late.

1393
01:25:38,164 --> 01:25:42,134
I'm already on the path.
I have to go where it leads.

1394
01:25:42,168 --> 01:25:44,337
It's going to lead
to you losing your job.

1395
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:45,370
Maybe...

1396
01:25:45,403 --> 01:25:48,406
But sometimes you just
have to operate on faith.

1397
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,275
Faith?

1398
01:25:50,308 --> 01:25:52,877
Al, you're in
the wrong profession.

1399
01:25:52,911 --> 01:25:55,113
But I've got
a good title for you.

1400
01:25:55,146 --> 01:25:57,082
Ready?

1401
01:25:57,115 --> 01:25:58,850
"Saint Frances."

1402
01:25:59,985 --> 01:26:01,853
- Um-hmm.
-Sorry...

1403
01:26:01,886 --> 01:26:03,989
I'm one miracle shy.

1404
01:26:04,022 --> 01:26:06,056
Yeah, well,
it ain't over yet.

1405
01:26:08,726 --> 01:26:10,060
Alan.

1406
01:26:10,094 --> 01:26:11,128
I heard.
Congratulations.

1407
01:26:11,161 --> 01:26:13,130
Now, I want you
out of my house.

1408
01:26:13,163 --> 01:26:15,165
Alan, we had
to save Moore.

1409
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:17,134
I mean it.
I just want you out.

1410
01:26:17,167 --> 01:26:18,836
Give me a break, okay?

1411
01:26:18,869 --> 01:26:20,738
That's really
not a very good idea.

1412
01:26:20,771 --> 01:26:22,106
I don't care.
This is my house,

1413
01:26:22,139 --> 01:26:24,074
and I want you out.
Just get out.

1414
01:26:24,108 --> 01:26:25,975
We've got to go.

1415
01:26:26,009 --> 01:26:27,343
Alan,
I'm going to be outside.

1416
01:26:27,377 --> 01:26:28,745
I'm not leaving you
by yourself.

1417
01:26:28,778 --> 01:26:30,713
You've got the number,
right?

1418
01:26:31,814 --> 01:26:34,751
Alan... you have
the number, right?

1419
01:26:45,028 --> 01:26:47,095
( Ringing )

1420
01:26:51,233 --> 01:26:53,001
( Ringing )

1421
01:26:56,238 --> 01:26:57,072
What?

1422
01:26:57,105 --> 01:27:00,175
Cheaters must pay
the price, Alan.

1423
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:01,977
( Sighing )

1424
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:03,912
Just fuck you,
all right?

1425
01:27:03,945 --> 01:27:05,380
I know you've killed him.

1426
01:27:05,414 --> 01:27:07,181
You've got nothing
to keep me quiet anymore.

1427
01:27:07,214 --> 01:27:09,083
I can tell everyone.

1428
01:27:09,116 --> 01:27:10,484
Can you?

1429
01:27:10,518 --> 01:27:12,386
What will happen
to your parents

1430
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:15,089
at 325 Gardner street?

1431
01:27:15,122 --> 01:27:18,359
Or your brother and his wife
at 1812 woodman drive?

1432
01:27:18,392 --> 01:27:21,228
Who will they blame
if there's no more baby

1433
01:27:21,262 --> 01:27:23,531
to throw
a birthday party for?

1434
01:27:23,564 --> 01:27:25,299
And it was such
a good one.

1435
01:27:25,332 --> 01:27:28,234
Barbara looked lovely...

1436
01:27:28,268 --> 01:27:31,037
Although I prefer her
in blue.

1437
01:27:31,071 --> 01:27:34,240
Light, like the shade
of her bedspread...

1438
01:27:34,274 --> 01:27:36,176
( Dial tone )

1439
01:27:45,585 --> 01:27:48,087
Looks like you're
a celebrity now, huh?

1440
01:27:59,198 --> 01:28:01,433
Oh, yeah.

1441
01:28:01,467 --> 01:28:03,168
Big star.

1442
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:10,875
He's been
in Barb's house.

1443
01:28:10,908 --> 01:28:13,244
He knows where
my family lives.

1444
01:28:13,277 --> 01:28:15,213
That's how he keeps us
quiet, isn't it?

1445
01:28:15,246 --> 01:28:17,415
Yeah.

1446
01:28:17,448 --> 01:28:19,317
I want you to make
a deal with me.

1447
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:21,385
What's that?

1448
01:28:21,419 --> 01:28:24,088
If I miss his last clue,
you walk away.

1449
01:28:24,122 --> 01:28:26,224
- I'll fend for myself.
- Alan...

1450
01:28:26,257 --> 01:28:28,492
It's bad enough
that I have to live

1451
01:28:28,525 --> 01:28:29,826
with what
happened to Lewis...

1452
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:31,595
But if he touches
my family,

1453
01:28:31,628 --> 01:28:33,530
or he touches Barb...

1454
01:28:34,631 --> 01:28:36,399
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

1455
01:28:36,433 --> 01:28:39,035
There are
things we can do
to protect them.

1456
01:28:39,069 --> 01:28:41,304
You can't guarantee anything,
and you know it.

1457
01:28:41,338 --> 01:28:44,040
And I can't afford
to take the risk.

1458
01:28:44,074 --> 01:28:47,343
So either you agree...

1459
01:28:47,376 --> 01:28:49,345
Or I'm gonna
shut you out.

1460
01:28:49,378 --> 01:28:51,380
You're not gonna see
my last clue.

1461
01:28:51,413 --> 01:28:52,381
Alan, you can't do this.

1462
01:28:52,414 --> 01:28:55,284
That's the fuckin' deal.
Take it or leave it.

1463
01:28:56,352 --> 01:28:58,187
- Okay.
-
All right?

1464
01:28:58,220 --> 01:28:59,021
Okay.

1465
01:29:00,322 --> 01:29:02,892
It was in my mail slot
this morning.

1466
01:29:13,334 --> 01:29:17,105
Vengeful bird did hunt
blindly in the storm.

1467
01:29:17,138 --> 01:29:19,174
A handful of ashes
for what lay in dirt.

1468
01:29:19,207 --> 01:29:22,443
Two are at rest,
two are at odds.

1469
01:29:24,279 --> 01:29:26,548
A feather in my hand
when it's done.

1470
01:29:26,581 --> 01:29:29,216
And I don't know who it is.

1471
01:29:32,386 --> 01:29:34,221
I just might.

1472
01:29:37,691 --> 01:29:39,359
It's Jean Laroque.

1473
01:29:39,393 --> 01:29:41,161
- The oceanographer?
- Yep.

1474
01:29:41,195 --> 01:29:43,163
He doesn't live here,
does he?

1475
01:29:43,197 --> 01:29:45,332
He's had his ship in the Marina
for the past two months.

1476
01:29:45,365 --> 01:29:47,267
He's filming a
new documentary here.

1477
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:48,434
You sure it's him?

1478
01:29:48,467 --> 01:29:52,205
The vengeful bird
is albatross ii.

1479
01:29:52,238 --> 01:29:55,942
The handful of ashes
is albatross I.

1480
01:29:55,975 --> 01:29:58,444
The Japanese torched it when he
was over there with Greenpeace

1481
01:29:58,477 --> 01:30:01,013
protesting commercial whaling.

1482
01:30:01,047 --> 01:30:03,049
Two of his crew died.

1483
01:30:03,082 --> 01:30:04,584
Two at rest.

1484
01:30:04,617 --> 01:30:06,652
You knew that?

1485
01:30:06,686 --> 01:30:09,254
So, here's what
we're going to do.

1486
01:30:09,287 --> 01:30:12,991
I'm going to have somebody drop
the clue off at the station.

1487
01:30:13,024 --> 01:30:14,392
You're gonna answer it, Al.

1488
01:30:14,426 --> 01:30:17,996
Take your time, think it out.
Make it look good, okay?

1489
01:30:18,029 --> 01:30:20,165
Alan, you're gonna have
to answer wrong.

1490
01:30:20,198 --> 01:30:21,566
But I've only
got one left.

1491
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,902
If I miss this,
I'm out of the game.

1492
01:30:26,438 --> 01:30:28,339
( Ringing )

1493
01:30:37,514 --> 01:30:38,549
Hello?

1494
01:30:38,582 --> 01:30:42,953
Hello, blue player.
Do you have your answer?

1495
01:30:44,288 --> 01:30:45,623
Randy Linch.

1496
01:30:45,656 --> 01:30:49,259
Blue player, you have
missed six questions.

1497
01:30:49,292 --> 01:30:51,394
You are out of the game.

1498
01:30:51,427 --> 01:30:53,029
( Dial tone )

1499
01:30:55,098 --> 01:30:56,499
All right,
go to the hotel.

1500
01:30:56,532 --> 01:30:58,268
I'll call you later.

1501
01:30:58,301 --> 01:31:00,136
Aren't you coming?

1502
01:31:00,169 --> 01:31:02,105
No, I've got something
I've got to do.

1503
01:31:02,138 --> 01:31:04,707
I'll catch up with
you later, all right?

1504
01:31:28,163 --> 01:31:32,166
No, it's too easy.

1505
01:31:34,502 --> 01:31:36,470
( Ringing )

1506
01:31:38,539 --> 01:31:41,409
- Hello?
-Congratulations.

1507
01:31:41,442 --> 01:31:43,411
It was an easy clue.

1508
01:31:43,444 --> 01:31:45,479
You should have spared
yourself the effort,

1509
01:31:45,513 --> 01:31:46,681
just written my name down.

1510
01:31:46,714 --> 01:31:48,482
You should be flattered.

1511
01:31:48,516 --> 01:31:51,551
I've given you
your 15 minutes of fame.

1512
01:31:51,584 --> 01:31:54,087
I'm sorry it has to
end so abruptly.

1513
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,089
Oh, I'm ready
for it to end.

1514
01:31:56,122 --> 01:31:59,326
I'm sure you are ready,
but it isn't that simple.

1515
01:31:59,359 --> 01:32:02,329
I have no intention
of coming to you.

1516
01:32:02,362 --> 01:32:03,730
You will come to me.

1517
01:32:03,763 --> 01:32:06,032
And to make sure
you come alone,

1518
01:32:06,066 --> 01:32:08,301
I've taken out
a little insurance.

1519
01:32:08,335 --> 01:32:10,202
Aldobrandi:
Swan?

1520
01:32:10,235 --> 01:32:11,470
( Nervous breathing )

1521
01:32:11,503 --> 01:32:14,106
Jesus Christ.

1522
01:32:15,574 --> 01:32:18,277
Aldobrandi.

1523
01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:20,112
It isn't Jean Laroque.

1524
01:32:22,748 --> 01:32:24,116
I know.

1525
01:32:24,149 --> 01:32:25,751
Don't come.

1526
01:32:29,354 --> 01:32:30,555
Where are you?

1527
01:32:30,588 --> 01:32:32,523
I don't know.

1528
01:32:34,425 --> 01:32:36,561
Prophet:
Such a brave girl.

1529
01:32:36,594 --> 01:32:39,797
She reminds me of Nancy.

1530
01:32:42,433 --> 01:32:43,768
Where are you?

1531
01:32:43,801 --> 01:32:48,573
Get your map out,
you're going to need it.

1532
01:32:59,616 --> 01:33:01,385
What are you...

1533
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,389
oh, my... god!

1534
01:33:18,401 --> 01:33:20,603
Holy Mary, mother of god,

1535
01:33:20,636 --> 01:33:23,506
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death...

1536
01:33:52,766 --> 01:33:55,636
( Distorted voice )
Welcome, detective.

1537
01:33:55,669 --> 01:33:57,538
Welcome, detective.

1538
01:34:01,241 --> 01:34:03,610
I said, "welcome."

1539
01:34:12,251 --> 01:34:14,654
Adele!
Adele!

1540
01:34:28,835 --> 01:34:31,770
Joey! Joey!

1541
01:34:59,630 --> 01:35:01,465
You were there.

1542
01:35:01,499 --> 01:35:04,635
I didn't kill the wrong man.
I couldn't remember.

1543
01:35:04,668 --> 01:35:06,637
You were a team.

1544
01:35:06,670 --> 01:35:10,307
That's good.
You're figuring it out.

1545
01:35:11,941 --> 01:35:13,643
Give me the gun.

1546
01:35:14,644 --> 01:35:15,979
Go ahead, shoot me.

1547
01:35:16,012 --> 01:35:19,849
When I fall,
this candle falls with me.

1548
01:35:19,883 --> 01:35:21,918
Do you smell
the gasoline?

1549
01:35:24,888 --> 01:35:26,389
Okay.

1550
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:30,226
All right.
All right.

1551
01:35:37,733 --> 01:35:39,935
Get down on your knees.

1552
01:35:41,336 --> 01:35:43,705
It's time to start begging.

1553
01:35:43,739 --> 01:35:44,806
All right,
you've got me.

1554
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:47,476
I do have you,
don't I?

1555
01:35:47,509 --> 01:35:50,345
And this time,
you're not walking away.

1556
01:35:50,379 --> 01:35:52,713
That's fine, but she has
nothing to do with this.

1557
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:56,250
She's not part of this game.
You can let her go.

1558
01:35:56,284 --> 01:35:57,652
Oh, but she is.

1559
01:35:57,685 --> 01:36:00,254
You get to watch
what I do to her.

1560
01:36:00,288 --> 01:36:02,557
Just like I had to watch what
you did to my brother.

1561
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:04,792
But, I had to kill him,
he was going to kill me.

1562
01:36:04,825 --> 01:36:06,627
But you made
a big mistake.

1563
01:36:07,728 --> 01:36:10,665
I was the one who
killed Nancy, not Joey.

1564
01:36:10,698 --> 01:36:13,733
And I should have been there
to protect him from you.

1565
01:36:13,767 --> 01:36:16,970
I should have cut you up
into little pieces.

1566
01:36:17,003 --> 01:36:19,039
I should have stuck
your head on that fence post

1567
01:36:19,072 --> 01:36:20,874
the way I did that
stupid dog of his.

1568
01:36:23,977 --> 01:36:26,580
Joey never laid a hand
on your daughter.

1569
01:36:26,613 --> 01:36:29,516
Why did you have to
go and kill him?

1570
01:36:29,549 --> 01:36:34,653
Why didn't you just let it go
like all the other families?

1571
01:36:34,687 --> 01:36:36,622
But you had to go
looking for revenge.

1572
01:36:36,655 --> 01:36:38,357
I was a detective.

1573
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:41,927
Revenge was never
my intention.

1574
01:36:41,961 --> 01:36:44,530
Yes, it was, big man.

1575
01:36:44,563 --> 01:36:46,765
You had to go
kill the monster.

1576
01:36:46,799 --> 01:36:49,768
Well, you ought
to know by now,

1577
01:36:49,802 --> 01:36:51,403
that when you enter
the monster's world,

1578
01:36:51,437 --> 01:36:53,371
the monster's world
enters you.

1579
01:36:53,404 --> 01:36:55,740
You're no better
than I am, detective.

1580
01:36:55,773 --> 01:36:57,809
I guess we're
both monsters.

1581
01:36:57,842 --> 01:36:59,277
But, she isn't.

1582
01:37:00,645 --> 01:37:03,848
I killed your brother.
You killed my daughter.

1583
01:37:03,881 --> 01:37:06,417
You can do whatever
you want to me.

1584
01:37:06,451 --> 01:37:07,685
But she's innocent.

1585
01:37:07,719 --> 01:37:09,621
For god's sake,
let her go.

1586
01:37:09,654 --> 01:37:11,789
You're in no position
to bargain.

1587
01:37:11,823 --> 01:37:13,724
You have nothing
left to offer.

1588
01:37:13,757 --> 01:37:15,659
How can I help her?

1589
01:37:15,692 --> 01:37:17,027
You already did.

1590
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:18,562
You came here.

1591
01:37:18,595 --> 01:37:20,497
I wanted you
to come here.

1592
01:37:21,498 --> 01:37:25,602
I wanted you to see
what you inspired.

1593
01:37:25,636 --> 01:37:28,338
I wanted you to see what
you're going to be a part of.

1594
01:37:40,716 --> 01:37:42,652
I couldn't decide...

1595
01:37:42,685 --> 01:37:47,556
Exactly what part of you
that I wanted for this.

1596
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:52,628
I knew it had to be something
very special, you see?

1597
01:37:52,662 --> 01:37:57,499
It was really hard,
because it had to be perfect.

1598
01:37:57,532 --> 01:38:01,770
You... you ripped my heart out
when you killed Joey.

1599
01:38:01,803 --> 01:38:03,471
You killed my daughter.

1600
01:38:03,505 --> 01:38:05,907
And I'm going to
rip your heart out.

1601
01:38:07,442 --> 01:38:09,044
And it's perfect.

1602
01:38:10,445 --> 01:38:12,580
It's perfect.
Because, you see...

1603
01:38:12,614 --> 01:38:15,416
Because you're what makes
the game tick.

1604
01:38:15,449 --> 01:38:17,751
You're the heart
of the game.

1605
01:38:17,785 --> 01:38:19,887
Are we having fun?

1606
01:38:24,425 --> 01:38:25,759
( Gun clicks )

1607
01:38:55,654 --> 01:38:56,755
We're out of here!

1608
01:39:09,634 --> 01:39:10,802
Are you okay, Al?

1609
01:39:10,836 --> 01:39:13,105
I'm fine.
I'm fine. Just go!

1610
01:39:14,505 --> 01:39:15,806
What, it wasn't loaded?

1611
01:39:16,807 --> 01:39:19,143
No, I just wanted
to throw her off.

1612
01:39:19,176 --> 01:39:20,878
And lucky for you,
it worked.

1613
01:39:20,911 --> 01:39:25,015
'Cause it wasn't me
that she shot at.

1614
01:39:25,049 --> 01:39:28,853
Just go. Just go.
I'll call for backup.

1615
01:39:28,886 --> 01:39:30,988
I left my phone in the car.
It's down the hill.

1616
01:40:10,659 --> 01:40:11,827
Holy Mary!

1617
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:13,529
Sweet Jesus!

1618
01:40:14,962 --> 01:40:16,864
Oh, god!

1619
01:40:20,301 --> 01:40:21,869
( Gunshot )

1620
01:40:45,225 --> 01:40:47,928
You son of a bitch.

1621
01:40:47,961 --> 01:40:51,565
You ripped my heart out
when you killed Joey.

1622
01:40:59,805 --> 01:41:01,040
Swan!

1623
01:41:01,907 --> 01:41:04,810
Swan.
Swan, come on, now.

1624
01:41:06,679 --> 01:41:08,247
Swan, you gotta help me.
Come on, now.

1625
01:41:38,842 --> 01:41:40,110
Adele!
( Gun clicks )

1626
01:41:41,178 --> 01:41:43,113
Drop the knife.

1627
01:41:43,146 --> 01:41:44,781
Lay it on the ground.

1628
01:41:44,815 --> 01:41:47,117
The gun's empty.

1629
01:41:47,150 --> 01:41:49,953
I've got one
in the chamber.

1630
01:41:52,322 --> 01:41:55,092
Now...
Drop the knife.

1631
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:57,760
You son of a bitch!

1632
01:41:57,793 --> 01:42:00,096
You spoil everything.

1633
01:42:02,331 --> 01:42:03,966
Put the knife down.

1634
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,101
Go ahead and shoot me.

1635
01:42:05,134 --> 01:42:08,004
Or have you developed
a conscience all of a sudden?

1636
01:42:08,037 --> 01:42:10,873
Or maybe you'd like
to beat me to death,

1637
01:42:10,907 --> 01:42:13,142
like I did
your precious daughter?

1638
01:42:13,175 --> 01:42:15,644
Put the knife down!

1639
01:42:16,077 --> 01:42:17,078
Take it.

1640
01:42:18,213 --> 01:42:19,247
Go on...

1641
01:42:19,281 --> 01:42:20,749
Take it.

1642
01:42:20,782 --> 01:42:23,051
- Stop!
- Take it!

1643
01:42:27,355 --> 01:42:29,624
Go ahead, kill me.

1644
01:42:29,658 --> 01:42:30,725
Shoot me.

1645
01:42:30,759 --> 01:42:33,094
You know you want to.
It'll make you feel better.

1646
01:42:33,128 --> 01:42:36,096
You can get away with it.
It'll be self-defense.

1647
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:37,031
Go on...

1648
01:42:37,064 --> 01:42:40,000
Go on, kill me.
Kill me.

1649
01:42:41,101 --> 01:42:43,637
It'll make you feel
so much better.

1650
01:42:43,671 --> 01:42:46,273
Go on, kill me.

1651
01:42:46,307 --> 01:42:49,877
Kill me. Kill me.

1652
01:42:51,178 --> 01:42:52,780
Come on...

1653
01:42:52,813 --> 01:42:54,315
Shoot me...

1654
01:42:54,348 --> 01:42:56,316
Please!

1655
01:42:58,918 --> 01:43:00,019
Please!

1656
01:43:00,053 --> 01:43:02,088
Officer down.

1657
01:43:03,323 --> 01:43:05,858
Stay with me now.
Stay with me.

1658
01:43:05,892 --> 01:43:07,727
Come on.

1659
01:43:08,027 --> 01:43:09,662
This really hurts.

1660
01:43:09,696 --> 01:43:12,799
Nobody said coming back from
the dead was going to be easy.

1661
01:43:14,133 --> 01:43:18,003
Looks like your third miracle,
Saint Frances.

1662
01:43:18,036 --> 01:43:19,938
Stop calling me Frances.

1663
01:43:22,007 --> 01:43:23,408
All right,
get her out of here.

1664
01:43:29,247 --> 01:43:31,683
Hang on there, Al, okay?

1665
01:43:31,883 --> 01:43:35,253
Come on, guys, you got to
get here there. Let's go.

1666
01:43:39,290 --> 01:43:40,124
Are you okay?

1667
01:43:40,157 --> 01:43:45,162
Yeah, it's just...
Really cold out here.

1668
01:43:48,132 --> 01:43:49,233
Swan?

1669
01:43:49,266 --> 01:43:50,968
Hey...

1670
01:43:51,002 --> 01:43:52,103
...swan.

1671
01:43:52,136 --> 01:43:53,371
Swan?

1672
01:44:00,310 --> 01:44:04,447
I'm gonna get you...
I'm gonna get you.

1673
01:44:04,481 --> 01:44:06,182
Lunch is ready.

1674
01:44:06,216 --> 01:44:08,151
Thanks, honey.

1675
01:44:16,926 --> 01:44:20,129
Swan:
Nobody said recovery
had to be painful.

1676
01:44:20,162 --> 01:44:21,897
Aldobrandi.

1677
01:44:24,767 --> 01:44:26,201
No, I guess not.

1678
01:44:37,079 --> 01:44:39,180
Joey...

1679
01:44:39,213 --> 01:44:41,916
They think they won...

1680
01:44:41,949 --> 01:44:44,152
They think they have me...

1681
01:44:44,185 --> 01:44:47,422
They think they're
smarter than us.

1682
01:44:47,455 --> 01:44:50,925
But they don't know...

1683
01:44:50,958 --> 01:44:53,127
We're not here...

1684
01:44:53,161 --> 01:44:56,130
We're just...

1685
01:44:56,164 --> 01:44:59,066
Not... here.
