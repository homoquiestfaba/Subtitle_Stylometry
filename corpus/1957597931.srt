1
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,123
How's it going?

2
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:22,041
Good.

3
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,751
Are you going downtown?

4
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:24,460
Yes, please.

5
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,421
Can you take me to a hotel, please?

6
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:28,756
Of course.

7
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,091
What kind of hotel, like...?

8
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,177
A hotel...

9
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:35,054
one that's comfortable...

10
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,055
not too expensive.

11
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,890
Oh, I've got a very good one.

12
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:41,185
How was your flight?

13
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,148
No, I missed it. There was no flight.

14
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,566
Oh you missed it?

15
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,318
How come?

16
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,487
I arrived a little late.

17
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:56,033
And they didn't want to help you out, huh?

18
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,165
How's life in Tijuana?

19
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,834
We're hanging in there.

20
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,335
Not too bad, it's good.

21
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,753
Things are calm.

22
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,048
It's not too dangerous?

23
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:15,094
No, it just has a bad reputation.

24
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,971
It's good...

25
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,430
everything is good here.

26
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,810
It's a good place to enjoy the night.

27
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,690
Do you go to the US?

28
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,986
No, I can't really go...

29
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,321
because of the visa and those things.

30
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,491
I don't have time for that stuff.

31
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:38,742
Do you go?

32
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:39,952
I live there.

33
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,287
Well...lived.

34
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,329
Oh, lived?

35
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,248
I'm coming back to Mexico.

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,667
You didn't enjoy life over there?

37
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,296
Yes and no.

38
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:55,593
This is Lomas Taurinas.

39
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:59,013
Remember? That's where they
say they gunned down Colosio.

40
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,556
Where the church is?

41
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:02,057
Yeah...

42
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,809
just below there.

43
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,060
Years ago, right?

44
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,147
Yeah, that was in like ninety-two or around then?

45
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:11,901
Yeah, it was there - Lomas Taurinas.

46
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,904
What do you think about that?

47
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,448
Oh, well I think...

48
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,160
it's a cover-up, right?

49
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,418
Tijuana's big.

50
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,631
Are you married?

51
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,137
Have you got kids?

52
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,308
You look worried, sir.

53
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,312
You'll see, at the hotel we're going to
you're gonna have a good time.

54
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,065
Do you like tacos?

55
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:51,982
Yeah, more or less.

56
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:54,777
Which ones? Asada, or...?

57
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,904
The maciza ones.

58
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:59,031
With steamed tortillas.

59
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:00,407
Do they sell them in Tijuana?

60
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,701
You've got everything close to the hotel.

61
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:03,911
But do they sell the ones I like?

62
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,996
Head tacos with steamed tortillas?

63
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:07,665
Yeah, all kinds.

64
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:09,959
Very tasty.

65
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,548
That one thinks he's Superman.

66
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,635
Like they say in my hometown...

67
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:21,303
must be a rubber man.

68
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,850
This is where the paraditas are.

69
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,060
What are the paraditas?

70
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:30,229
Those are the many girls who are standing around here.

71
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,438
Are they prostitutes?

72
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,690
Yes.

73
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,817
Most of them.

74
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,032
Look, this is the hotel.

75
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:42,825
Which one is it?

76
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,868
That one over there.

77
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,122
Listen, can we go to a different place?

78
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,582
Nah, this is good.

79
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,959
It's very good here.

80
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,669
Look, and those are the tacos I told you about.

81
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:55,379
The tacos?

82
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,218
Take me to another place, please.

83
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,137
It looks kind of dangerous.

84
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,389
No, don't worry about it.

85
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:09,893
Come on, you're gonna like it.

86
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,270
You're gonna have a good time.

87
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,689
I guarantee it.

88
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:16,984
OK, thank you.

89
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,027
Have a good new year.

90
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,111
You, too.

91
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,281
You'll be good here.

92
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,155
Fucking taxi driver.

93
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,336
Yes, from six twenty-nine.

94
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,505
Big favor.

95
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,299
Can you wake me up at eight
in the morning tomorrow, please?

96
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:08,178
Oh no, you know what? At six.

97
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,264
At six because my flight leaves at eight.

98
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:12,891
Yes, please.

99
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,394
OK, that's the deal.

100
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,521
Thank you.

101
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,240
What the fuck?

102
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,561
Is this for sleeping or what?

103
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,109
They must be acrobats.

104
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,373
Ah, three beds.

105
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,876
That's how they are, Ma.

106
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,713
It's not like the bus there - it's a plane.
That's how they are.

107
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,424
Yes, exactly.

108
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,593
Very organized.

109
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,431
Not in Los Angeles, I'm in Tijuana.

110
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,936
Because it was less expensive from here.

111
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,063
Remember I don't have much money now.

112
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,151
No, don't worry, it's pretty safe.

113
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,404
Yes, I'm in a hotel. I'm in a hotel here.

114
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,614
It's...

115
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,491
it's elegant.

116
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,533
Sorry.

117
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,202
They actually have three...

118
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,578
they have three beds.

119
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,580
Well, two...two and a little one.

120
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,792
Yeah, it's a...it's a pretty neighborhood.

121
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,128
Yes, it's quiet around here.

122
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,508
I feel sad also.

123
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,468
I wanted to see you all.

124
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,512
Enjoy the tamale feast.

125
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,805
Save some for me.

126
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,182
And some champurrado
cause I'm gonna arrive hungry.

127
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,186
Give a strong hug to Pa.

128
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,731
To my sisters and my brother also, please.

129
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,608
OK, Ma. Enjoy the celebration.

130
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,484
Happy New Year.

131
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:28,819
See you tomorrow.

132
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:35,969
No, thank you.

133
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:36,845
But come here.

134
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,055
What do you want?

135
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,520
How does it work?

136
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:47,522
Two-ninety.

137
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,608
For everything?

138
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,902
No, from the waist down.

139
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,740
And for everything?

140
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,117
Four-fifty.

141
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:00,577
Pesos?

142
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,167
Come on.

143
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,045
It's just...

144
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,338
it's just...

145
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,174
What's the problem?

146
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,976
Why are you a prostitute?

147
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,522
Get the fuck out of here, asshole.

148
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,482
Son of a filthy whore!

149
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,359
Faggot!

150
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,030
Son...

151
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,740
you come from far away, right?

152
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,409
More or less.

153
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:27,122
I was looking at you from here
and I noticed your aura is very dark.

154
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,665
You're on a dead-end road.

155
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:32,169
Somebody must've put a spell on you
to prevent you from reaching your destination.

156
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,088
Something's telling me that...

157
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,590
you're in danger.

158
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,884
I would like to read your cards.

159
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:39,551
The cards?

160
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:43,054
Yes, the cards.
In the cards you can see the future.

161
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:44,848
Is that expensive?

162
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,475
No, it's cheap.

163
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,645
Let's do it.

164
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,902
What's your name, whitey?

165
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,070
Alejandro.

166
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,121
Alejandro Serna.

167
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,292
You came from far away, right?

168
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:16,421
No, I'm coming from Los Angeles now,
but I'm originally from Guanajuato.

169
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:23,136
Let's see what the tarot tells us about you.

170
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,098
Cut it in three with your left hand.

171
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,188
Put your hand...

172
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,399
for me...for my present.

173
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:38,944
For my past.

174
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,570
And for my future.

175
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:51,623
The cards say that...you have cried a lot.

176
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,543
That you had a problem.

177
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,587
Somewhere...in a relationship.

178
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:02,050
It seems like somebody got fired from their job.

179
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,220
There is a young lady...

180
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,056
who thinks about you a lot.

181
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,642
And there's another one...

182
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,311
who's close to you who shows a lot of interest.

183
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,815
It talks about a lot of interest
from this dark-skinned young lady.

184
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,276
You like dark-skinned women, right?

185
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:21,903
Well...

186
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:23,697
I don't discriminate.

187
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,031
You don't discriminate?

188
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,326
It shows...

189
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:32,497
there are a lot of people around you.

190
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:37,127
Those people are gonna get close to you,
but be careful because there is also danger.

191
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,838
Danger...from other people.

192
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,591
It says that there's a dark-skinned man.

193
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,467
It seems like this guy...

194
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,095
feels some jealousy toward you.

195
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,097
You've gotta be careful with him.

196
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,850
It says that he's aware of
what you do and what you say.

197
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:55,437
You have a lot of enemies.

198
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,147
It's telling me that.

199
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,857
Does it say why?

200
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:03,570
Yes, it says that it's because of work-related problems.

201
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:07,657
Disagreements. Misunderstandings.

202
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,328
And it could also be because of...

203
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,751
racial issues.

204
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,252
It talks about racism.

205
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:25,425
It says that sometimes at night you
get sad...melancholic...you feel lonely.

206
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,137
It talks about a lot of loneliness.

207
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:38,647
Your aura looks dirty.
That's why all these things are happening to you.

208
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,691
Do I get it dirty or do other people?
How does it get dirty?

209
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:47,447
The aura usually gets dirty
because we do negative things.

210
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,409
And also because of other people's envy.

211
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,496
We are like energy.

212
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,706
And energy also gets dirty.

213
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:00,752
And when that happens everything in us gets stuck.

214
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,587
And prayer cleans the aura?

215
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,382
Prayer is very important.

216
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,841
It's fundamental.

217
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:19,562
I'm still a sinner in the flesh...

218
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:24,401
but repented in the presence of God.

219
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:30,323
He knows the struggle inside me.

220
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,283
What hurts me.

221
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,245
He knows...

222
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,123
all about me.

223
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,625
And also about you.

224
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,295
God is talking to you.

225
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:51,052
What you need to be wary of is spiritual death.

226
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:55,098
The word death means separation.

227
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:01,563
When you physically die, your
soul and your body get separated.

228
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:07,485
But when you die spiritually, your soul could go to Hell...

229
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:13,366
And it won't come back to God,
who's the one who wants to save you.

230
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:34,929
Good evening.

231
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:35,930
Good evening.

232
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:37,724
What do you sell here?

233
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,517
Hot dogs and hamburgers.

234
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,060
Give me a hot dog, please.

235
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:43,772
With everything?

236
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,356
Yes, what do you put on it?

237
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:49,527
Mayonnaise, tomato, onion,
ketchup, mustard, chile and cheese.

238
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:50,862
Cheese?

239
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,865
What kind of cheese?

240
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,158
Liquid cheese.

241
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,409
Ah, liquid?

242
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,076
OK.

243
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:57,702
Everything?

244
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:58,870
Yes, please.

245
00:17:59,245 --> 00:17:59,829
Thank you, Happy New Year.

246
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,539
Same to you.

247
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,174
A flower.

248
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,761
Hey, look!

249
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,908
Nice to meet you.

250
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,952
Nice to meet you.

251
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:28,454
You speak Spanish?

252
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,372
Yes, I'm from Guanajuato.

253
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:31,207
Ah, nice to meet you. Welcome to Tijuana.

254
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,250
Thank you.

255
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,674
My sister, you met her.

256
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:40,967
Yes, we met.

257
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:00,486
Thank you.

258
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,948
So you used to be Ana's teacher?

259
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,034
Well yes, I used to.

260
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,326
Chicano Studies.

261
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:08,536
What's that about?

262
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,705
Chicano Studies, well, it's...

263
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,498
we don't have it in Mexico, but...

264
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:18,087
it's basically about the struggles of
Mexican-Americans who live in the United States.

265
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,298
And their fight for social equality...

266
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,385
political equality...equality at work.

267
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:25,762
Basically something like that.

268
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:27,346
It's very interesting.

269
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,599
You should give some classes later.

270
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,434
Of course, of course, we'll talk about it.

271
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:32,935
Are you interested...?

272
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:35,688
Cheers to the Chicanos. Fuck yeah!

273
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,440
Happy New Year!

274
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,239
Excuse me.

275
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:28,783
Professor...

276
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,453
a bong hit?

277
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,205
No, thank you.

278
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:47,260
No, thank you.

279
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,553
The thing is...

280
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,805
I don't smoke weed.

281
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,142
Well...

282
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,104
in part because...

283
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,274
I understand some Spanish, OK?

284
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,526
That's right, she speaks perfectly.

285
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:05,361
So keep going.

286
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:06,362
OK, in Spanish.

287
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:08,573
Whatever you want. Tell him, my love.

288
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,122
A bong hit, my professor.

289
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:17,999
For New Year's.

290
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,751
For New Year's.

291
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:41,189
Don't bullshit me, professor.
That was in the past.

292
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,609
They don't care about weed anymore.

293
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,485
Didn't you watch "Breaking Bad?"

294
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,529
There's the answer - "Breaking Bad."

295
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,206
Come on, don't be a pussy.

296
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,291
You're missing out, this is...

297
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,807
Come on, let's do it.

298
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,977
Inhale, professor, inhale!

299
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,312
Inhale hard!

300
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:28,444
Harder, inhale inhale! More, more!

301
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:29,862
Harder!

302
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,083
Good, professor, good.

303
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:44,293
Your eyes.

304
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:45,211
Let me see.

305
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,463
Oh shit!

306
00:28:56,444 --> 00:29:01,490
...if you're not here.

307
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,206
Bravo, Bernie.

308
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,668
Professor, professor!

309
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,053
Let's see, something, something, something...

310
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,057
let's see if you like it.

311
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,309
Bring it on.

312
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:22,488
Take it easy, Sylvio Rodríguez.

313
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,614
It's time to go now.

314
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:24,698
Let's go.

315
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,538
Andiamo, Chucho.

316
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:43,592
Take it easy, Sylvio Rodríguez.

317
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:46,136
You're gonna make me cry, homie.

318
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,020
It's time.

319
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:16,333
I really like how you played.

320
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,711
Congratulations. I've always wanted to play guitar.

321
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:19,837
Oh really? Thank you.

322
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:24,883
Yeah, if you could teach me I would really like to learn.

323
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:25,551
Guitar?

324
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:27,970
I played so badly, so many mistakes.

325
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:31,015
Did you notice I couldn't remember it?

326
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:36,562
I want to thank you for giving me the
opportunity to celebrate the new year with you.

327
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,689
Thank you very much.

328
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:43,444
He crashed it, he crashed it.

329
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,154
I crashed it.

330
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,698
Luis, Carla, thank you very much.

331
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:58,167
Now I'll light it for you.

332
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,801
So you missed your flight? Where were you going?

333
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,971
I was going to - I was just five
minutes late, can you believe it?

334
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:11,513
Really?

335
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,682
Yes. To Guanajuato.

336
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:14,683
León, Guanajuato.

337
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,602
Do you live there, or...?

338
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:18,020
My family...

339
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:19,146
my family's from there.

340
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,190
You were going to spend New Year's Eve there?

341
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,943
But I missed my flight, and...

342
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:25,736
you know what?

343
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:26,820
What?

344
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,573
I don't care.

345
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:30,240
Are you having fun?

346
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:33,702
In fact, I'm having a blast.

347
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,537
That's good.

348
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,039
Tijuana's very cool, I like it a lot.

349
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:38,123
I'm having a blast.

350
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,500
You don't smoke much?

351
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:40,709
Yes...

352
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:41,835
yes.

353
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,879
A little. Not much, but a little.

354
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,230
Like the gringo would say - I like Tijuana.

355
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:34,638
In the United States they...

356
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,225
don't know or don't want to know about the quality...

357
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:40,269
of the Mexican people.

358
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,106
The mainstream media only talks about...

359
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:46,692
oh, those Mexicans...

360
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,819
here they come, the drug smugglers...

361
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:51,238
the gangsters...

362
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,656
the drunks...

363
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:58,537
the ones who take advantage of welfare.

364
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:02,750
Those are the Mexicans that the gringos think we are.

365
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,377
But they don't know about the great culture we have.

366
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:06,170
They don't know.

367
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:13,051
They have no idea about our
ancestry and all the culture of our history.

368
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:19,433
And besides that, they have no idea about
all the heart that Mexicans put into everything they do.

369
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,518
Towards their family and the work they do.

370
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,020
The passion?

371
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,563
Yes, a lot of passion, a lot of heart...

372
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:28,025
they do everything with a lot of enthusiasm.

373
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:32,404
I mean, they cry. The Mexican is
more sentimental than it seems like.

374
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:35,866
They have no idea about the warmth that the Mexican has.

375
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:38,786
It doesn't matter where you're from,
the Mexican is very welcoming.

376
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,037
Very, very warm...

377
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,288
very horny!

378
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,456
No, warm!

379
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:45,209
Horny!

380
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:55,302
I scared you.

381
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:56,678
You got scared.

382
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:58,472
You got scared!

383
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:15,382
Go ahead, sir.

384
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:05,158
Failure?

385
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,529
I'm not afraid of anything.

386
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:43,363
A little.

387
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:07,906
Alright, we're all gathered here together
in this little corner of Tijuana - Tribeca!

388
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:12,661
All together as friends, as family...

389
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:20,794
we're all here tonight to celebrate,
get down, and get drunk to welcome the new year!

390
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:26,424
How are all you drunk Tijuana people doing down there?

391
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,719
Together as a family...

392
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:35,016
come on, let me see everybody
with your right hand up. All the way up, up, up!

393
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,601
Everybody put your hand up!

394
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,960
Happy New Year Tijuana!

395
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,663
Happy New Year, motherfuckers!

396
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:20,807
This is for girls.

397
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,686
Get me a shot please, sister.

398
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:50,855
Hey.

399
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:54,234
I need to tell you something.

400
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,487
What you're doing is OK.

401
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,739
It's OK, don't be ashamed.

402
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:01,449
You, brother...

403
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:02,742
don't need these.

404
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:04,035
Take them off, look...

405
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:06,246
you can see, master.

406
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,080
Really?

407
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:08,998
You can see, you don't need this.

408
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:12,001
You can do it because you see with your mind.

409
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,211
You understand?

410
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:14,796
You can see better.

411
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:16,881
Better than anybody else.

412
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,383
And you know what I'm talking about.

413
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:19,551
Now enjoy.

414
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,136
Thank you.

415
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,305
Masters.

416
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:25,849
What...what's up?

417
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,225
How are you doing?

418
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:29,686
Master - look at me, look at me.

419
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:32,397
Cut this fucking hair, man.

420
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:32,814
What?

421
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:34,441
Really, I'm serious.

422
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:46,411
Bernardo...

423
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:47,287
What do you want?

424
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:49,330
He's Bernardo.

425
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,540
No, Bernardo!

426
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:51,499
What?

427
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,376
OK there you are. There you are.

428
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:54,502
We got it.

429
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,545
We got it!

430
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:56,880
What are you talking about?

431
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,593
Since we got here...
since the house, he's been looking at her.

432
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:02,927
Looking and looking.

433
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:08,266
He gets close to her, then he makes eyes at her
and shit. You think I don't notice? You think I'm stupid?

434
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:10,393
She's got a very nice dress.

435
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:12,479
Do you like women or men?

436
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,855
Tell him the truth.

437
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:14,772
Men.

438
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:16,107
Men?

439
00:46:16,149 --> 00:46:18,318
Look, if you like women that's OK.

440
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,111
It's not a problem.

441
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:25,825
Right?

442
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,165
Johnny, we're already there, homie.

443
00:46:32,207 --> 00:46:33,374
We're there!

444
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:34,626
Nothing else is needed.

445
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:37,670
You know it, homie.

446
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:38,379
Nothing!

447
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,099
OK, people.

448
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:51,851
I'll be right back.

449
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:53,937
Have another shot.

450
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,605
I'll be back for another shot.

451
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:18,920
You OK?

452
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:21,798
Professor Serna.

453
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:33,142
Are you OK, Professor Serna?

454
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:57,769
You know.

455
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:07,362
Leave him.

456
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:11,240
Leave him, Ana. Leave him today.

457
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:22,210
Enough.

458
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:23,127
Hold on, hold on.

459
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:25,046
You'd better stop, better stop.

460
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:28,633
You're making a fool of yourself, brother.

461
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:29,509
No.

462
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,178
No, I'm not making a fool of myself.

463
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:34,972
Stop it now, fucker!

464
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:36,432
That's enough!

465
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,393
Stop being a pain in the ass, you son of a bitch!

466
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:39,686
Luis, she's not for you.

467
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,313
Stop talking to my girl, asshole!

468
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:44,524
Shut the fuck up - don't touch me, fucker!

469
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:45,942
Now! Get the fuck out of here!

470
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,444
Get the fuck out of here!

471
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,117
Leave me alone!

472
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:55,868
Get the fuck out!

473
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:58,496
Get the fuck out of here!

474
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:04,794
It's over, it's over, relax.

475
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:41,098
Can you hear me?

476
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:44,143
Sir, can you hear me?

477
00:51:45,812 --> 00:51:48,189
Sir, I need to make a phone call,
can I have a coin?

478
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:49,398
From the ones that are in your bucket?

479
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:53,402
I need to call my mom, sir...

480
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,822
I'll give you my scarf and I'll pay you later.

481
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:05,081
I'm gonna take a coin, sir...

482
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,290
but I'm gonna pay you later, OK?

483
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:00,469
Hey sir, sir.

484
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:01,137
Listen to me.

485
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,847
Enough! Stop drinking!

486
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:04,056
Listen to me.

487
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:05,224
Listen, listen!

488
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:07,602
Look into my eyes!
There, there, hold it, hold it!

489
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:11,022
Stop drinking now. Now! Wait, wait!

490
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:13,983
Sir, I'm talking to you - it's time to stop drinking.

491
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,125
Look at his pupils.

492
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:33,377
I like his necklace.

493
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:36,422
How much did you pay for it, boy?

494
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:37,506
Are you mute?

495
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:39,008
Can I see it?

496
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,384
Are you a faggot?

497
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:41,510
Can I see it?

498
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,602
That thing's fake.

499
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:50,895
You think so?

500
00:53:50,937 --> 00:53:52,104
Fantasy.

501
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:55,608
Well, I hope it protects you.

502
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:16,814
Hey.

503
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:20,943
What do you want?

504
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:22,528
Can I sit here?

505
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,205
Hey, sir.

506
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,419
Can I tell you something?

507
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:42,048
Yeah, but right now I'm sleeping, brother.

508
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:44,592
Yeah, but just quickly, quickly.

509
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:45,676
OK, go ahead.

510
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:46,510
Because it's urgent.

511
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:47,845
Go ahead.

512
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:54,602
They're following me.

513
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:57,188
Who's following you?

514
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:57,855
All of them.

515
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:02,151
I don't know if it's the police...

516
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:04,737
or even normal people. They look normal.

517
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:06,322
You know how they are.

518
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:08,199
They're undercover.

519
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:10,910
I notice. I see them...

520
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,454
and then they look at me...

521
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:18,167
and I notice. Those fuckers don't fool me.

522
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,961
They're driving in their cars...

523
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:24,715
and when they realize I see them,
they pretend to be on their phone.

524
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,009
They don't fool me.

525
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,344
And why are they looking for you?

526
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,142
Because this is my last day.

527
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:37,144
They wanna kill you or what?

528
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:40,689
They want to eliminate me because...

529
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:42,441
I'm not good for them, you know?

530
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:44,151
Do you know something about them?

531
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,444
Everything.

532
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:51,951
It's been...

533
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:56,831
it's been a long time since I've been to confession.

534
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,501
Can I confess to you?

535
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:02,878
Please?

536
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:04,880
But...

537
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:05,965
Please.

538
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:09,468
To confess you need somebody who has that gift, but...

539
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:11,428
Can you listen to me?

540
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:13,222
Yes, yes, of course.

541
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:14,682
Because...

542
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:16,559
I need to confess, sir.

543
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,769
Get it all out.

544
00:57:19,854 --> 00:57:21,063
Well...

545
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:27,278
I've done many bad things, you know.

546
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,905
I haven't followed the Word of God.

547
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,996
But most of all...

548
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,291
but most of all, what...

549
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,252
what hurts me the most...

550
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:45,462
I have failed my people.

551
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:49,258
To "la raza."

552
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:53,345
I've failed the community...

553
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,139
the "movimiento."

554
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:57,600
Let it out.

555
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:00,102
I've failed the "movimiento."

556
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:04,440
That's what hurts the most.

557
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,526
That's what hurts the most.

558
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:10,196
That's my biggest sin.

559
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:14,325
That's my biggest sin.

560
00:58:16,744 --> 00:58:18,662
Why today?

561
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:21,457
There are so many things I can do...

562
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,792
if He would give me the opportunity...

563
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,837
the opportunity to try things again...

564
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:29,340
a little more time, just a little more.

565
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:31,175
Why today?

566
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:40,643
I don't want to die...yet.

567
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:44,688
I'm not too young, but I'm not old.

568
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:47,316
I don't have a family yet.

569
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:51,111
I want to have a family, I want to have kids.

570
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:55,491
I haven't even gotten married yet.

571
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:58,911
Why so soon? Why today?

572
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,961
If only I could do something to avoid it, but I can't.

573
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:10,798
Today I die.

574
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,970
Don't worry about dying...

575
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:21,392
compared to what I'm going through -
enduring the cold and suffering...

576
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:24,645
death would end my misery.

577
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:31,193
Because living this life - suffering,
enduring people's pity and disgust...

578
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,112
it's better not to.

579
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:39,660
At least somebody's interested in you
to kill you. Nobody cares about me.

580
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:51,213
That's true, huh?

581
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:53,966
I'm a lucky one.

582
00:59:54,008 --> 00:59:57,219
At least you know you're going to die tonight...

583
00:59:57,678 --> 01:00:02,141
most people don't know when, so they won't
have the opportunity to ask God for forgiveness.

584
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:07,187
Even if your body's dying today,
if you repent your soul can be saved.

585
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:11,817
Otherwise both your body and soul will be lost.

586
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:14,820
So it's up to you.

587
01:02:34,293 --> 01:02:34,835
Happy New Year.

588
01:02:34,877 --> 01:02:36,295
Same to you.

589
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:41,508
Happy New Year, brother.

590
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:43,010
A hug?

591
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:45,554
Why not?

592
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:52,769
Yes, sir! Happy New Year!

593
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:58,358
Same to you.

594
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,239
Good morning, Happy New Year.

595
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:05,741
Good morning, same to you.

596
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:21,882
I'm sorry, sir.

597
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:23,592
Go ahead, don't worry.

598
01:03:42,528 --> 01:03:43,487
Good morning.

599
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,613
Hello.

600
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:46,406
Hello.

601
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:52,079
It's me, from yesterday.

602
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:55,624
The asshole.

603
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:02,923
Listen, I want to apologize.

604
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:04,800
For what?

605
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:09,513
Well, you got angry yesterday.

606
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:14,851
Good morning, sir.

607
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:16,019
Good morning.

608
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:17,104
What do you sell?

609
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:18,146
Huaraches.

610
01:04:18,814 --> 01:04:19,856
Carne asada.

611
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,109
Give me one, please.

612
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:23,235
Have a seat.

613
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:24,111
Thank you.

614
01:04:32,953 --> 01:04:34,746
But honestly, I want to apologize.

615
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:35,998
Forget it.

616
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,009
What a beautiful day, right?

617
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:50,429
Gorgeous.

618
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:53,307
Happy New Year.

619
01:04:56,393 --> 01:05:00,105
I wish you all the best and great health.

620
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:06,987
Seedless grapes, strawberries!

621
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:14,244
Do you have plans for today?

622
01:05:20,626 --> 01:05:21,668
You already have plans?

623
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:22,544
Yes.

624
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:23,712
With who?

625
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:25,213
With nobody.

626
01:05:40,479 --> 01:05:42,272
I don't know if you notice...

627
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:48,862
on the Mexican side there are a lot of houses, families...
everybody sees what the border's like.

628
01:05:48,904 --> 01:05:50,739
But on the U.S. side...

629
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:52,658
there's not one house.

630
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:56,036
The first house is...I don't know
how many kilometers or miles away.

631
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:59,289
So people in the United States don't realize what happens.

632
01:06:02,084 --> 01:06:04,711
This is music from the Mexican Revolution.

633
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:09,132
From the early nineteen-hundreds.

634
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:10,842
They can't come over to this side?

635
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:13,011
And you can't go on that side?

636
01:06:13,762 --> 01:06:17,224
General Pancho Villa was a
very famous Mexican revolutionary.

637
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:20,268
Like this.

638
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:27,651
You don't even know.

639
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:33,615
He invaded a town there
and came back with his army.

640
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:39,371
After that, the US Army went to Mexico
looking for him for months, but they never found him.

641
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:43,667
Because people would protect him.

642
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:08,191
He's fast.

643
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:14,114
Oh, it's Rodolfo Gaona.

644
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:15,991
Who's that?

645
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,952
He's the most famous bullfighter in Mexican history.

646
01:07:18,994 --> 01:07:21,913
And he's from Guanajuato...
León, Guanajuato, where I'm from.

647
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:24,583
He invented a lot of moves, with the cape, with...

648
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:26,209
with the "muleta..."

649
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,462
"La Gaonera" is his most famous one.

650
01:07:29,296 --> 01:07:32,507
And the first song I learned as a child...

651
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:36,511
it was "Rodolfo Gaona."
My grandmother taught it to me when I was about...

652
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:38,597
five years old, more or less.

653
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:44,895
I am Rodolfo Gaona...

654
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:49,024
the brave one with the Mexican sword.

655
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:52,444
There's no bullfighter in Spain...

656
01:07:52,486 --> 01:07:56,531
who can compete with me in the Gypsy style.

657
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:04,915
The horsemen are up
and the bullfighters are down...

658
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:08,794
and in the ring are all the banderilleros.

659
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:13,340
Olé, bullfighter, there's nothing like it...

660
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:18,136
the beautiful way you position yourself for the kill.

661
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:28,480
Hey, sir!

662
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:31,191
Can we take a look at the plaza?

663
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:33,235
Oh we can. Come!

664
01:08:37,072 --> 01:08:38,240
How are you, sir?

665
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:39,199
Nice to meet you, Alejandro.

666
01:08:39,241 --> 01:08:40,033
José Francisco.

667
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:42,494
It's a pleasure. And what's the dog's name?

668
01:08:42,536 --> 01:08:43,578
Billy.

669
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,747
Billy. Hello, Billy.

670
01:08:46,665 --> 01:08:48,041
Where do the bullfighters enter from?

671
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:49,334
That way, from cuadrillas.

672
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:50,919
Cuadrillas, right? Can you take us?

673
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:51,378
Of course.

674
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:53,380
Please. Thank you.

675
01:08:54,506 --> 01:08:56,049
The plaza's big.

676
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:57,592
It's the third in the world.

677
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,052
The third largest?

678
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:01,304
That's the entrance, right?

679
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:02,305
Yes, all the way down.

680
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:03,890
I'll be back.

681
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,019
He already thinks he's a bullfighter.

682
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:12,899
Come on, let's watch him from the stands.

683
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:14,818
Help me.

684
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:18,238
Oh, now I'm a chaperone.

685
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:56,985
For you.

686
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:00,006
Who's this crazy man?
