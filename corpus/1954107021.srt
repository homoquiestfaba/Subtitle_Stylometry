1
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,689
Not exactly what I
was looking for.

2
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,162
Wait a minute, Bob. This is not
the only option we've got for you.

3
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,685
Phil.

4
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,809
Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)
Yeah.

5
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,121
Why do it like that,
in grey asparagus,

6
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,489
when you can do it completely
differently in hunter green?

7
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,561
Thank you for your time.

8
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,926
- Bob...
- MAN: Bob?

9
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,246
Have a seat.

10
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,321
Who's that?

11
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,200
It's Chris Meyers, one of our
brightest, young junior execs.

12
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,965
He's very, very bright.

13
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,690
You got 60 seconds.

14
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,044
Say hello to the Krayton koala.

15
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,566
He's soft, cuddly, absorbent.

16
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,087
I present to you the new
face of Krayton bath tissue.

17
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,366
Wow!

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,801
You got yourselves a client.

19
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,881
Yeah.

20
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,883
- Yes!
- (ALL CHEER)

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,923
- Unbelievable.
- He's a genius.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,445
- Hate to admit it, buddy.
- Hey.

23
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,443
- But you really saved my ass.
- Ah!

24
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,066
You've got a big raise
coming to you, pal.

25
00:02:24,092 --> 00:02:25,708
You better believe it,
you cheap bastard.

26
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,127
- Let's go get me pregnant.
- Oh, sounds like a plan.

27
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,440
ALL: (CHANTING) Chris!

28
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,249
Thank you. Back to work.
Back to work.

29
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,765
ALL: (CHANTING) Chris!
MAN: Chris!

30
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,604
It's all I ever wanted.

31
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,523
Chris. Chris!

32
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,810
Hey, Phil. What's up?

33
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,326
What's up?
It's crunch time, dude.

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,448
Krayton's coming in
for the redesign pitch today.

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,807
Need that bad boy ASA
quick as possible.

36
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,327
Yeah, no, I got all the versions you
wanted done, exactly per your specs.

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,401
What's that one right there?

38
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,005
Oh, I actually...

39
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,259
I actually just did a
design of my own, too.

40
00:02:57,285 --> 00:02:59,076
Kind of was hoping
to pitch Krayton.

41
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,770
Cool. Cool.

42
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,571
Why don't you let me take a look at it?
Maybe I can run it up to the big man.

43
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,883
- Yeah, let us give the old look-see.
- That's a great idea, Troy.

44
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,726
I'm just... I'm actually...
I'm really psyched about this one.

45
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,202
And I was kind of hoping to
just take it to him myself.

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,410
Well, credit will be given where
credit's due. It's just that... Fuck.

47
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,562
Look at that girl, Troy.

48
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,966
- (SIGHS)
- (GRUNTS)

49
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,280
PHIL: I tell you what.

50
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,724
Why don't you practise
the pitch on me?

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,041
Let me hear it one time,
make sure it's in tip-top shape.

52
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,604
You don't wanna go in there and pitch
it to Krayton, look like an asshole.

53
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,208
Okay. I'm Krayton, you're you.
Pitch me.

54
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,361
Well, get ready.

55
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,163
And razzle goes the dazzle.

56
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,169
Don't ever say that again.

57
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,086
I was trying to pick up the energy, but I
heard it coming out, and it felt wrong.

58
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,566
What's with the goblin?

59
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,005
Right there on the K.

60
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,525
No. That's a koala bear.

61
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,840
Why is there a koala bear?

62
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,410
Troy brings up a good point.

63
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,131
Well, I did a ton of research
into buying trends

64
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,089
for more intimate products
like bath tissue.

65
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,128
Yeah. Chris...

66
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,521
(PHIL SIGHS)

67
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,490
I hate to say this to you, buddy.

68
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,800
It's not that cuddly.

69
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,688
It's got black, soulless eyes.

70
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,047
- Like a demon's eyes.
- They are like a demon's eyes.

71
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,009
No, no, they're green.
Demons' eyes are red.

72
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,401
I think you're missing the point.

73
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,681
You gotta imagine yourself
on the toilet, right?

74
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,650
You got your pants around your
ankles, and you just wanna do what?

75
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,803
All you really want is to get
the shit out of your butt.

76
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,723
You wanna relax.

77
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,162
You don't wanna have to
worry about anything,

78
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:40,035
especially an
Australian devil bear

79
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,731
coming up out of the toilet
and clawing at your nut sack.

80
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,562
Well, I think that
might just be your own

81
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:46,432
very personal association
with koala bears.

82
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,925
- Is it?
- No.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,331
No, that's the image I got,
too, right away.

84
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:49,997
You got it, too?

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,081
- Yeah.
- Troy got it.

86
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,080
I feel like you guys aren't
letting this sink in.

87
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,723
It just sunk in. Here's the thing. Gotta
call an audible. Not gonna use this.

88
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,882
Let's go with the tried and true.
Should we vote?

89
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,722
Tried and true. All right.

90
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,801
Troy likes it.

91
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,200
I didn't know which way Troy was
gonna go. Thank you, Troy.

92
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,403
All right, just trying to look
out for you, homey G.

93
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,370
Let's go, Troy.

94
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,966
I mean, I don't care
if he's technically your superior.

95
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,841
You don't have to take
that shit off him, man.

96
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,920
Well, technically, I do.
That's what superior means.

97
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,127
Ugh!

98
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,282
- Good morning, Chris.
- Hey.

99
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,486
Jared.

100
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,403
Are you sleeping with Brenda again?

101
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,687
No. Not presently.

102
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,003
But I just gotta tell you, man,
there is something about that girl.

103
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,766
She just unleashes
something primal in me.

104
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,887
I know what you mean.

105
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,450
Hey. Hey!

106
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,842
What's up? (GIGGLES)

107
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,685
You ladies gossiping again
about all the hot guys in the office?

108
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,205
Uh, busted. Yeah.
Chris and I were just talking about

109
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,601
stripping down to our bra and panties
and having a little tickle fight.

110
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,808
If you're interested in joining,
maybe refereeing?

111
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,247
He's joking.
We've never tickled each other.

112
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,045
We would never do that.

113
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,690
Right.

114
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,445
Um...

115
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,040
Anyway, I'm actually just
here on official HR business.

116
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,246
Just to remind you guys

117
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,290
about the big mystery meeting
in the conference room at 4:00 p.m.

118
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,442
- Hoo! Why all the secrecy?
- I don't know.

119
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,366
Crawford just says it's very important.
So just don't be late, okay?

120
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,204
Okay.

121
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,725
It's a date.

122
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,606
Hmm?

123
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,008
- (SIGHS)
- What is wrong with you?

124
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,686
I hate myself.
I'm a horrible person.

125
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,889
You have a heart.
That's about all you have right now.

126
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,610
Hey, Brenda.

127
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,001
Just a reminder, we have a 4:00
meeting in the conference room.

128
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,127
I remember.

129
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,850
Hey, did I show you the
newest addition to the fam?

130
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,081
No.

131
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,811
I'm calling him Sergeant Snuggles.

132
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,121
'Cause he's reporting for duty,
like, every day.

133
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,362
Aw! Brenda,
I didn't know you liked rabbits.

134
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,568
Oh, yeah, right, Lisa.

135
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,291
(LAUGHS)

136
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,491
Did I ever show you this one?

137
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,403
- Oh, is that you?
- Yes.

138
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,166
And that there is Mr Bumbles.
He was my favourite.

139
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,050
When I was eight,
I wanted to marry him.

140
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,521
But society would never allow that.

141
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,367
Well, you never know.

142
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,366
No.

143
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,570
Chris, why aren't you at the pitch?

144
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,980
Phil said Krayton's
not coming until 3:00.

145
00:07:25,006 --> 00:07:26,909
No, it's on the books for 2:15.

146
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,460
What?

147
00:07:27,475 --> 00:07:29,431
Yeah. They're all in
the conference room.

148
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,891
Aw!

149
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,563
In the wild, koala bears
don't need to wipe their bottom.

150
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,770
But if they did, they would ask
Koala Phil how to do it.

151
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,047
- (ALL APPLAUDING)
- I like it! I like it!

152
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,210
Thank you.

153
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,850
Thanks very much.

154
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,490
Thanks, everybody.

155
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,486
Gosh!

156
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,404
How can he just so blatantly
steal my work like that?

157
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,482
"Koala Phil"?
It's not even alliterative.

158
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,562
Yeah. That's the real tragedy.

159
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,201
You know, he's just
gonna homogenise it,

160
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,811
and in the end, it's gonna
look like every other koala.

161
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,008
All right. You know what?
Let's take care of Phil once and for all.

162
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,840
Call my buddy Regg.
He's an Algonquin Indian.

163
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,087
We tell him there's a white guy
fucking up shit for you and your land.

164
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,208
- He'll take care of it. 40 bucks.
- You know what I'm gonna do?

165
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,248
I'm gonna march right into
Mr Crawford's office.

166
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,401
I'm gonna march right in.

167
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,482
I'm gonna tell him exactly what
Phil did, just lay it right out.

168
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,369
You do it. You do it.
Right this wrong.

169
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,844
We shall overcome!

170
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,968
- Where do you think you're going?
- I need to speak to him.

171
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,041
He's in a meeting.

172
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,121
Can you please open the door?

173
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,440
Absolutely not.

174
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,600
Sounds like I'll make
us a tee time, then.

175
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:37,027
Bring your wallet, bitch.

176
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,889
(CHUCKLES) I'm not a bitch.

177
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,883
- LISA: Um, Mr Crawford?
- Yes?

178
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,200
Chris wants a word with you.

179
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,327
Now, Chris, I believe you
believe Koala Phil is your idea.

180
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,210
But sometimes, a person can think that
they came up with something

181
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,089
when it actually came
from somewhere else.

182
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,080
Mr Crawford, that is not
what happened here. I...

183
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,726
Now this sort of thing
happens all the time.

184
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,010
For 25 years, I was convinced
that I invented the BLT.

185
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,447
The bacon-lettuce-and-tomato
sandwich?

186
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,409
Absolutely positive.

187
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,811
I'd brag to women about it.

188
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,723
I tried to convince my friends.

189
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,122
Well, turns out
it dates back to the 19th century.

190
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,285
I must've been exposed to it
when I was a child, and forgotten.

191
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,203
The brain, you know.

192
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,009
So let's just let this one go, okay?

193
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,287
Mr Crawford, Phil stole my work.

194
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,124
Why do you think

195
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,761
I was given the Martin P. Shulman
Award for Excellence in Business?

196
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,606
For beating my meat
in some goddamn jerk-off competition?

197
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,842
It would be a very misleading name
if that were the case.

198
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,766
Not that I couldn't hold my own
in a competition like that.

199
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,330
I could.

200
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,609
I'd be able to perform, no problem.

201
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,806
I'm sure.

202
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,927
No.

203
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,929
I got this award because I know a thing
or two about what I'm doing, God damn it.

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,040
And what I want from you, son, is for you
to stop trying to sabotage Phil Trager.

205
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,447
And start trying to emulate him.

206
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,841
Prove to me

207
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,447
that you deserve a place
here on the Crawford team.

208
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,329
Go. Go get 'em.

209
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,724
I did you a favour, bud.

210
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,849
You would've blown that pitch.
Now the koala lives on.

211
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,241
You had no right to do that.
You had no right.

212
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,800
Chris, what is with the
selfish behaviour?

213
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,646
The ideas within these walls
are our ideas. We're a family.

214
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,846
Yeah.

215
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,050
Oh, by the way, if you ever tattletale
on me again, things are gonna get ugly.

216
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,327
Real F-ing ugly.

217
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,320
My entire adult life
has been spent in packaging design.

218
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,770
I've come into this office every day
at 7:00 sharp for the last 27 years.

219
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,524
And that could be any one of you.

220
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,490
Even you back there
with the squidgy face.

221
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,325
If you can show the
teamwork and leadership

222
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,768
necessary to succeed
in this tough economic climate.

223
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,121
But, frankly, I haven't seen
much of that from any of you.

224
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,284
Except, of course, for Phil.

225
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,203
Come on, boss. It's a team sport.

226
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,522
That's why, tomorrow,
I'm sending all of you

227
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,889
on a mandatory two-day, two-night
teamwork leadership wilderness retreat.

228
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,961
What?

229
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,931
Now, I will not be able to
accompany you on this excursion.

230
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,001
But I turn it over
to a man who will.

231
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,320
MAN: Thank you.

232
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,201
My name is Storm.

233
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,123
Storm Rothchild.

234
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,041
I'm a certified teamwork instructor.

235
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,122
Now, I know what you're thinking.

236
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,163
"This guy teaches about business?
We went to Harvard University." Whatever.

237
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,848
Well, I'm here to tell you,
I went to my own school,

238
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,287
the school of the hard knocks.

239
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,291
I also took some
classes at DeVry once.

240
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,805
Mostly web design.

241
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,885
But then some stuff came up.
You know, some personal stuff.

242
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,525
(SNORTS)

243
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,366
Am I interrupting you?

244
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,681
No. No.

245
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,000
Can I see that, please?

246
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,687
Yeah, I... It's not something...
It's not... I just...

247
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,611
Sorry about that.

248
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,808
You must have big
rocks between your legs.

249
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,644
I... No.

250
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,370
You think you can stare
me down, boy?

251
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,363
Stare you down?

252
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,523
No, I mean, you're just talking.
I'm just listening.

253
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,385
Shh!

254
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:08,550
And I was... Okay. I'm
not staring you down.

255
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,127
Strike one.

256
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,646
Oh, shit.

257
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,405
STORM: I'm a military man.

258
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,482
Navy SEAL, Special Forces,
you name it.

259
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,881
I've seen men die.

260
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,405
I've made men cry.

261
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,131
I will offer you the most intense
wilderness experience allowed by law.

262
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,565
We'll fly off to an island

263
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,521
where it will be you
and me versus nature.

264
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,323
I will teach you negotiation.

265
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,200
Teamwork.

266
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,721
Leadership.

267
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:53,123
And if we're not too careful,
we may have a little fun.

268
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,807
I will see you at 0600.

269
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,166
Dismissed.

270
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,241
Oh! Hang on.

271
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,247
We're gonna have a little soiree in honour
of Phil and the Krayton deal at McCabe's.

272
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,360
Drinks are on the company.

273
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,883
- Great!
- Yes!

274
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,731
I don't know.

275
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,010
Teamwork.

276
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,844
Mortal Kombat is more like it.

277
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,161
Relax, Dale. It's just a silly
team-building exercise.

278
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,210
Word has it, there are some major
cutbacks coming down the pike.

279
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,489
How you perform on this trip determines
your future with this company.

283
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,646
Yeah, all right, Dale.
We're just trying to have a good time.

284
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,525
I'm having a good time.

285
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,686
I wouldn't count on
these drinks being for free.

286
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,045
That is a dark human being.

287
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,851
Just one more, and then cut
me off, please. Thank you.

288
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,846
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

289
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,365
You ready for this big nature trip?

290
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,649
Oh, I am shitting
myself in anticipation.

291
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,403
I'm not much of a camper,
but it could be fun, right?

292
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,326
I'm not much of a camper either.
But luckily for us, Chris is.

293
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,289
In fact, this man was an Eagle
Scout when he was, like, 25.

294
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,601
That's not true. I was 19.
Then I cut it off.

295
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,569
They even made him a scoutmaster.

296
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,881
And he was taking boys out
in the woods and stuff.

297
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,041
Well, it's really... I'd sound so...

298
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,122
- I'd stop talking about it.
- Why don't you stop the humility act?

299
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,645
'Cause he also won
the Silver Badger,

300
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,802
which is, like, the highest award
that the Boy Scouts give out.

301
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,245
- So, we're in good hands.
- Beaver. It's the Beaver.

302
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,765
Cool. Excuse me?

303
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,684
It's the Silver Beaver.
Minor distinction.

304
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,289
Silver Beaver?

305
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,850
That's a terrible name.

306
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,649
I'm sorry.

307
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,080
If I knew that was the name,
I would not have brought it up.

308
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,321
Thanks so much.

309
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,649
Well, it'll be really good to have
you out there, Silver Beaver.

310

Oh, I'm sorry.

311

I can't believe I have to spend a weekend
on an island with Phil.

You gotta relax, man.
Guy's not worth it.

313
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,762
Don't do that. I don't wanna
show up smelling like pot.

picked me up, then.

Oh! And look who it is now.

It's little Jenny Wong, the Kung Fu
Panda, 'cause she's Asian.

374

- You know, just once,

I would like to eat a fortune cookie
out of Jenny Wong's butthole.

Being here reminds
me of a famous story

411
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,885
about some young boys
being stuck in an island.

412
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,962
Before long, they turn into animals.

413
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,850
And from there,
everything goes straight to hell.

417
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,247
And the island was Pleasure Island.

418
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,442
They spend all day
eating candy, playing pool.

419
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,682
And they turn into donkeys.

420
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,765
And then I don't remember.

421

I haven't seen it for a long time.

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,240

be happening here.

- What?
- Stick your finger into the tiger's anus!

Why in the hell would he want us to
put a finger in his asshole?

Thanks for asking, Phil.

What do you need?

every woman, no matter how
strong she thinks she is,

575

from a man.

be that man for you.

- Damn it! Are you sure?
- Yeah.

I used to do ham radio
on the weekends with my dad.

It was like child abuse
without the touching.

just take a deep breath,

and describe to me
exactly what the snake looked like.

00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,723
It was big, and it had black
swirls and dots on it.

Can I talk to you for a second?

Sure, Phil. What's up?

00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,486
Are you sure you're up for
this being in charge business?

You think so.

673
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,765
Well, being a leader is tough.
You've seen me at the office.

674
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,410
You know how that can get.

675
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,687
Frankly, I'm not sure
you can handle it.

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,762
What are you talking about?

677
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,884
Come on, man.
Like it isn't totally obvious?

decide which of us gets eaten first.

00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,765
I don't like nuts!

685
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,127
- And Javier would feed a lot of people.
- All right.

686
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,248
Phil, can you knock it off, please?
Chris is in charge.

687
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,845
We're all on board
with this, right?

688
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,002
- Yes.
- Yeah, I think we're good, Phil.

689
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,807
Fine.

690
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,088
You wanna follow Pocahontas?

691
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,650
Don't blame me.

692
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,165
What's up, Javier?

693
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,526
Hey.

694
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,250
All right, people.

695
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,891
Let's get back to work.
We've got a big day ahead of us.

696
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,007
What happened to everybody?
They were all doing so well.

697
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,287
I don't know. It's just like
at the office, you know?

698
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,800
They're good to work for a little
while, then it's nappy time.

699
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,931
- Javier?
- Javi?

700
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,570
Hey, buddy.

701
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,680
Weren't you supposed to
be on food gathering detail?

702
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,009
Oh, go away. Sleepy.

703
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,361
(SCOFFS)

704
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,089
Okay, everybody. We really gotta
kick it into high gear. Ugh!

705
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,969
Come on, guys!

706
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,883
I don't know how many
times I have to say this.

707
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,048
When you go number two,

708
00:36:43,074 --> 00:36:46,149
you've gotta go at least 50 yards
from the campsite, all right?

709
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,726
I'm not trying to be a buzzkill,
but it's a major health hazard.

710
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,690
Hey, man. Nobody's on food detail,
and whoever's on tiger watch took off.

711
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,280
You gotta step up and
take charge, man.

712
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,685
These people are just gonna
keep slap-dicking around.

713
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,171
Okay. Okay, Jared.
I'm on it.

714
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,480
- All right, buddy. Let's go.
- Okay.

715
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,484
Hey, everybody!
Look over here.

716
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,088
Thought you'd all want something
to eat besides nuts.

717
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,447
- Behold!
- We bring meat!

718
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,967
Ugh!

719
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,690
I killed it with my own bare hands.

720
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,091
- Isn't that right, Troy?
- Yes!

721
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,207
Meat!

722
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,408
That looks like it's been
dead at least two weeks.

723
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,811
And that's not all.

724
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,682
Oh, no. Is that coffee?

725
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,047
- You bet your fat ass it is.
- Hey!

726
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,522
I found the plants just over that ridge.
There's enough for all of us.

727
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,728
Oh, God. Tastes so good.

728
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,531
Okay, okay, you guys.
I don't know about the coffee yet,

729
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,843
but I can tell you for sure that
that meat is not safe to consume.

730
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,207
I'm afraid that's not
your decision, Chris.

731
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,727
And I invite all of you to
share in my bounty.

732
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,808
- Oh, God. That looks so delicious.
- I wouldn't do it. I strongly...

733
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,006
Luther. Hey, Dale. Don't.
The meat's no good.

734
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,560
- Ashley.
- I advise against this.

735
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,131
(CHUCKLES)

736
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,761
Yeah!

737
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,890
He put up a real fight, but I snuck
up behind him and snapped his neck.

738
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,290
It's the least I could do.

739
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,488
- We're a family now.
- Yeah. We are.

740
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,800
MAN: Right, man.

741
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,804
- Try it.
- No, thanks. I'm good. Thank you.

742
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,744
Look, I understand
that we're not at the

743
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:26,912
office and everyone's
under a lot of stress.

744
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,266
But I just feel that
some of the language

745
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:31,707
that I've been hearing
tossed around lately

746
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,569
is offensive to some people.

747
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,044
I've heard MFer.

748
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,088
I've heard CSer.

749
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,688
I've heard A-hole,
BJ, F this F-ing S.

750
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,808
Check out that B's T's.

751
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,566
Slip it in her C-hole.
F it in the fudge shop.

752
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,281
S on that donkey D,
you dirty F-ing S-bag,

753
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,126
then L up that V-juice
and spit it in my A.

754
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,489
Then H it till it's sore
with your S-covered P-pounder.

755
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,005

756
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,844
Who gives a shit?

757
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,888
Hey, it's Brenda's turn to speak.
She can say whatever she wants.

758
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,611
You know the rules.
I have the talking stick.

759
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,683
Screw the rules!

760
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,171
Phil, enough.

761
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,921
Yeah, Brenda.
Screw your rules!

762
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,241
I'm holding the talking stick.

763
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,609
Stick means nothing!

764
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,889
Come on. Sit down.

00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,721
- PHIL: No.
- (THUDDING)

766
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,891
I won't sit down.

767
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:37,169
Because I am so sick of your rules!

768
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,086
So's everybody else.

769
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,323
Come on, Dale. Stand up.
Come on, you guys.

770
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,687
Why should we listen to you?

771
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,683
- Everybody knows...
- WOMAN: Stand up.

772
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,524
I should be leader.

773
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,370
This isn't helping, Phil. Okay?
Come on. We're all in this together.

when he won't even
stand up to me now?

Will you?

00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,571
Huh?

00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,490
Will you, Chris?

In front of all these people?

788
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,491
You gonna stand up to me?

No, he's not gonna do anything

No? Well, what are you
gonna do tonight?

I don't know. Probably
have another orgy.

getting off this island,
you come with me.

Fine, Phil. Whatever.

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,530
Good luck running things around here.
You're gonna need it.

857

Be gone forever!

858
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,287
And don't let me catch you
back on my side of the island!

859
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,401

fucked, then hustle on back.

I just picked a few berries

874
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,882
and had some crackers,
threw in a little sugar, and voila.

so, I just...

or something like that.

next to my hang gliding one.

badge for hang gliding?

I was strapped to my scoutmaster.

Well, the truth is I...

896
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,971
I always imagined my life being
a lot more interesting than it is.

897
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,840
I went to work straight after school
like some trained robot.

898

never even really lived.

I feel the exact same way.

900
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,961
I probably should've done something
about it a long time ago.

It sounds like you need
to be a little bit more assertive.

be a good quality.

to your clean language crusade?

is no other word to describe this.

00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,650
And I've had it since
I got here, too.

911
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,850
I've had to take a shit. But I thought
I could wait till I got home.

1026
00:52:04,102 --> 00:52:05,703
but the circuitry there
looked all right.

1027
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,286
We don't speak geek.

1028
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,330
Listen, darling,
what I'm trying to say is

1029
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,209
if we get that radio
out of the plane,

1030
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,200
there's a decent chance
I could rig something up.

1031
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,924
What about him?
We can't just leave him here.

1032
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,001
STORM: I'm okay.

1033
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,445
I'll be fine.

1034
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,168
We'll work something out.

1035
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,567
Stop. Park me here.

1036
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,646
What do you see?

1037
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,566
I am not quite sure.

1038
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,290
Dude, let me see.

1039
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,122
They've all gone shit-dick crazy.

1040
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,806
Yes, I saw Phil forcing them to eat

1041
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,770
that Jimsonweed all day.

1042
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:04,845
I tried a little bit of it myself, but
I was tripping balls for six hours.

1043
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:05,921
Couldn't feel my face.

1044
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,130
What is that?

1045
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,245
Let me see those.

1046
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,211
Oh, Phil has had a
statue of himself made.

1047
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,686
BRENDA: Oh!

1048
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,169
Solid craftsmanship.

1049
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,411
And they're worshipping
him like a God.

1050
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,971
I guess reasoning with him
isn't gonna be an option.

1051
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,486
Maybe we should just
take the radio.

1052
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,131
I mean, the plane's at least
200 yards from Phil's camp.

1053
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,804
He might not notice.

1054
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,528
No such luck. They got guards
stationed at the plane.

1055
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,170
- That crazy fucker!
- God.

1056
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,605
It's like he doesn't
even wanna go home.

1057
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,605
Hey, guys, if we want to steal
that radio from that plane,

1058
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,602
we'll have to use our
heads and our brains.

1059
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,041
It's the same fucking thing, Storm.

1060
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,931
I think I'll go talk to him alone.
I can still reason with him.

1061
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,207
- Are you sure, Chris?
- Yeah.

1062
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,001
Hey.

1063
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,723
Just be careful, okay?

1064
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,205
I will.

1065
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,685
BRENDA: Aw!

1066
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,886
(CHUCKLING) What?

1067
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:37,290
Keep in pile. You, separate sticks.
Big sticks, little sticks.

1068
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,201
(SIGHS)

1069
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,566
Oh!

1070
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,801
Deserter returns.

1071
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,206
Halt, Outsider.

1072
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,521
You're a trespasser here.

1073
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,251
Hey, Dale. What's up?
Look, I just wanna talk.

1074
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,327
Hi. Hi. How are you?

1075
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,447
What is your purpose here?

1076
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,127
Wow. You guys have really gotten
serious around here, huh?

1077
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,806
Gone is the time of mirth and joy.
Those days ended

1078
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,929
when the great winged beast of iron and
steel brought us here from the sky.

1079
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,971
Are you talking about the plane, Dale?
Come on. You know what a plane is.

1080
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,849
Look, I just need to talk to Phil.
Do you know where he is?

1081
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,445
Who is this "Phil" you speak of?

1082
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,205
He speaks of the Lawgiver.

1083
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,481
Okay.

1084
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,721
- Oh, Orco.
- Orco.

1085
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,847
- Orco?
- Oh, yeah.

1086
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,921
<i>Oy.</i>

1087
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,002
No one demands to see the Lawgiver.

1088
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,081
Let's slit his throat.

1089
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,726
Whoa, come on. Come on, Dale.
Calm down, you guys.

1090
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,801
Hey. Hey. All right.

1091
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,927
(WHISPERING)

1092
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,684
- Come on. Let's not. Let's not.
- Wait.

1093
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,724
Well, Outsider,
it seems you get your wish.

1094
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,404
The Lawgiver will see you.

1095
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,606
Okay.

1096
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,886
(SIGHS)

1097
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,329
Did you come here to kill me?

1098
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,765
Come on, Phil. This is stupid.
Just knock it off.

1099
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,804
I would watch your tongue
if I were you, Outsider.

1100
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,166
Okay. Noted.

1101
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,562
Look, Phil, we found a bunker.

1102
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,125
Phil?

1103
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,566
Phil. I don't know this word.

1104
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,609
Right, no, I'm sorry.

1105
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,961
Orco.

1106
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,561
Yes. Orco.

1107
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,644
Do you know how I chose
the name Orco for myself?

1108
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,884
It's the name of an ancient Babylonian
God, the god of wrath and destruction.

1109
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,646
I think it was also the name of that
floaty little wizard guy in He-Man.

1110
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,165
- Heresy!
- Calm.

1111
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,641
Calm, my pet.

1112
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,561
I spell mine with a C.

1113
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,201
So it's different.

1114
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,566
Yeah, it's different.

1115
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,331
Yes.

1116
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,568
Time for my morning juice.

1117
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,768
(COUGHS)

1118
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,082
Very bitter. That's gross!

1119
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,605
To the Pit of Shame with you!

1120
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,721
(GASPS)

1121
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,001
You shame yourself!

1122
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,609
Come, let's take a walk.

1123
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,481
This is where my minions toil
to harvest the beans

1124
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,847
from which we make the sacred brew.

1125
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,211
Pick faster. Faster.

1126
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,569
Well, it's nice to see that you
didn't eat Javier at least.

1127
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,291
I actually tried a couple of his fingers,
but it was gross.

1128
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,407
Really gamy.

1129
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,528
Keep the berries separate.

1130
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,820
Do you see the power
that I have over them?

1131
00:57:40,846 --> 00:57:41,628
(MOUTHING)

1132
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,125
I do, yeah.

1133
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,207
I'm willing to give
you a taste of it.

1134
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,760
I'm offering you a job
as my second in command.

1135
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,046
Why?

1136
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,681
Because I could use someone
with your know-how

1137
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,084
for the day-to-day running-the-camp
stuff, basically all the boring shit.

1138
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,841
Gee, Orco,
I'm really flattered, but...

1139
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,524
Did I mention the perks?

1140
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,241
Power, glory,
any woman you want.

1141
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,883
Well, none of the super hot ones.
Those are for me.

1142
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,804
But, you know, any of the older,
chubbier ones. Barbara from accounting.

1143
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,405
Oh, she's a big girl.

1144
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,448
Yeah, I don't want Barbara
from accounting, or...

1145
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,251
You haven't even gotten to know her.
She's a sweet lady.

1146
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,085
Listen, we found
another radio, okay?

1147
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,401
Jared thinks he can get it working if we
can get a part from the one on the plane.

1148
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,881
I don't know, bro.

1149
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,486
I kind of got a pretty good deal
going on here, you know?

1150
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,804
Out there I'm just a senior VP,
but here I'm a god.

1151
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,881
Orco.

1152
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,724
Yeah, but think about this.

1153
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,122
You give us that part. We get out
of here. You're a hero.

1154
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,846
Not just here on the island,
but out there in the real world.

1155
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,689
Everybody's gonna know your name.

1156
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,366
Hmm...

1157
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,684
- interesting.
- Yeah.

1158
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,445
That you would try to sweet talk me
into giving up my empire.

1159
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,363
LOL, friend. Guards!

1160
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,369
Phil. Phil, please.
We're never gonna get off this island.

1161
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,441
PHIL: No, we won't.

1162
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,444
If you come back here
again, Outsider,

1163
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,091
we will cut off your dick
and make a soup out of it.

1164
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,491
Cream of Chris!

1165
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,851
- Let's go play some hacky sack.
- Got it.

1166
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:15,160
Poor little bunny.
You almost got eaten by a tiger.

1167
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,363
I wish I could give you a carrot.

1168
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,769
- That would be nice.
- Yeah.

1169
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,525
Storm, I think your wound is
getting worse. It kind of stinks.

1170
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,285
Is that what that is?

1171
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,441
It smells nasty.

1172
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,564
I also didn't take a bath
for a while, okay?

1173
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,361
Tell me you got it.

1174
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,727
I'd be lying.

1175
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:35,847
Seriously, dude?

1176
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,082
Yeah. I asked.
He said no.

1177
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,524
You asked?

1178
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:44,810
He asked. I'm so fucking glad you asked.
Did you say please, at least, Chris?

1179
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,006
- LISA: Jared.
- Yes.

1180
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:50,881
No. I'm tired. I'm cranky.
I'm out of weed, and I wanna go home!

1181
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,920
What do you want me to do, Jared?
You want me to challenge Phil to a fight?

1182
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,684
No, Chris.

1183
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,969
I want you to continue
being the world's

1184
00:59:57,995 --> 01:00:00,473
biggest pussy until we
all die of starvation.

1185
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:04,161
Oh! Come on! You're the pussy.
You're the pussy!

1186
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,810
- You're a pussy.
- You're the pussy!

1187
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,008
Guys! This is not getting
us anywhere, okay?

1188
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,368
Brenda, who is the bigger
female reproductive organ?

1189
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,246
I think you're both vaginas.

1190
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,400
You know what?
I would've been better off with Phil.

1191
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,282
Wow.
Why don't you go join him then?

1192
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,966
Yeah. At least he's doing drugs
and having orgies.

1193
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,841
Instead I'm gonna die

about me being the...

1200

01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,170

No.

1203
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,681
You're not a pussy.
You're just...

1204
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,368
- Nice?
- Yeah. You're really nice.

1205
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,330
Yeah. I know.
I think that's part of the problem.

1206
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,122
My whole life,
I'm such a nice guy.

1207

"It's Chris. He's so nice.
Look at Chris, he's nice."

Which is all well and good,
you know?

1209
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,000
Except that nobody ever gives you any
of the credit you deserve for anything.

1210
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:15,443
Or will actually even consider publishing
your really good fantasy novel,

1211
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,091
even though it's clearly
better than 90%

1212
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,731
of the Sword and Shadows
derivative crap that's out there.

1213
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,727
And it's like these
out-of-touch publishers

1214
01:01:23,753 --> 01:01:26,469
are calling it fetish
porn, and it's not.

1215
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,162
Okay, yes, there's one
very tastefully done,

1216
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,210
very understated love scene
between a dark elf and a centaur.

1217
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,607
And that is integral to the plot.
You know?

1218
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,286
You need it...

1219
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,235
Okay, Chris, I think
maybe you're drifting

1220
01:01:40,261 --> 01:01:41,787
away from the point
here a little.

1221
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,204
The point is that you
just keep taking it

1222
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,602
because you're too nice to stand
up and do anything about it.

1223
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,886
(SIGHS) Yeah.
You're nice. You are.

That's what everyone likes about you.

1225
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,444
I wouldn't want you to change that.

1226
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,091
But there's a time to be nice.

1227
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:06,688
And then there's also a time when you
have to say, "Enough is enough."

1228
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,684
And stick your foot
so far up a prick like Phil's ass

1229
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,684
that he chokes on your
fucking shoelaces.

1230
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,081
And I think now is
one of those times.

1231

I do, too.

- Listen, Chris.

1233
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:30,286
There's a time to play nice.
And there's also come a time

1234

when you have to say,
"Enough is enough."

01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,690
What is that smell?

1365
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,247
(SNIFFS) It's pussy.

1366
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,603
You, who are called Jared,

1367
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,081
come forward.

1368
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,851
Step forward, Jared!

1369
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,361
Dale.

1370
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,565
All right. It's funny, Phil.
I get it. It's not cool.

1371
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,529
You have anything to
say before you die?

1372
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,246
You're a real asshole, Phil.

1373
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,523
- What?
- Be that as it may...

1374
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,043
- Still, you shall die.
- TROY: Yes!

1375

1376
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:16,970
He's just kidding.

1377
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,008
Phil. No.
Come on, I'll do anything.

1378
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,525
Dale.

1379
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,251
Phil, I'm begging you, brother.
Please don't.

1380
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,321
We'll be your slaves.

1381
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,531
Yeah, we get it, whatever
you fucking want.

1382
01:11:26,557 --> 01:11:28,396
Don't have Dale cut
my head off, man.

1383
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,647
You don't wanna do this.

1384
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,131
Phil. Please, man.

1385
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:42,450
This isn't you, man.
Things just got weird.

1386
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,560
Sorry, dude.

1387
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,850
I was just gonna put you in a cage,
or whip you with bamboo or something.

1388
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,046
But, well...

1389
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,326
It's what they want.

1390
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:00,921
Please.

1391
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,246
I love you, Brenda.

1392
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,447
You do?

1393
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:13,601
I'm sorry.

1398

(INAUDIBLE)

1400
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,682
Wait!

1401
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,969
Lower your blade!

1402
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:01,410
So, you've returned just in time
to watch your friends die.

1403
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:02,686
Perhaps you'll join them.

1404
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,491
I don't think so, Orco.

1405
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:09,121
I have returned to claim
my rightful place

1406
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,328
as the true god of this tribe!

1407
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,931
You? A god?
(LAUGHS)

1408
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:17,361
That's right.

1409
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,683
And I command my subjects
to sever their allegiance

1410
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:26,529
to the false Lord Orco and
bow before my mighty loins,

1411
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,685
lest they should feel my wrath.

1412
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:31,601
Tell me.

1413
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:35,048
Can the impostor Orco fly
as the birds of the sky do?

1414
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,566
Just a minute.

1415
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,445
Almost there.

1416
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,410
That was amazing.

1417
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,451
1 mean, 1...

1418
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,325
That was unreal.

1419
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,882
Or, can the impostor conjure fire

1420
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,205
from stone?

1421
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,084
Oh! Oh!

1422
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,561
PHIL: Magic tricks.

1423
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,324
These are tricks! Don't be fooled!

1424
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:59,683
Really? I'm not sure the tribe
is quite so convinced.

1425
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,886
So either prove to me your divinity
by fighting and killing me,

1426
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:06,725
or you will reveal
yourself to be a liar,

1427
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,645
a coward,
and an all-around piece of shit.

1428
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,806
Fine! I accept your challenge!

1429
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,001
Good.

1430
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:18,607
We will resolve this once and for all
with a fight to the death.

1431
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,250
To the Pit of Destiny.

1432
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,647
Where's the Pit of Destiny?

1433
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:29,246
Let's just clear out
the Pit of Shame.

1434
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,731
Yeah.

Come on! Yeah! Yeah!

it'd come to this. Right, Chris?

1437
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:47,569

Yeah.

you'll write to me?

Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

How often?

1553
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,001
Write you once a month?

1554
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,081
I need more.

1555
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,131
I could do once a week.

1556
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,603

01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,844

How was that for more assertive?

I didn't wanna come on too
strong, and I...

I gotta admit it, Chris.

1571
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,001
I always saw you as kind
of a sissy boy.

1572
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:17,287
But you really proved me wrong
out there on that island.

1573
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,130
You got balls, son.

1574
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,567
Big balls. Just like me.

1575
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:25,841
I bet if we pulled our balls
out and compared them,

1576
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,729
they'd be exactly the same size.

1577

with us, Chris.

Vice President of Design.

you say that to me.

This position is exactly
what I've wanted.

It has been on the top
of my vision board.

1585
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,844
But out there on that island,
I realised something.

1586

What's that, son?

1587
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,001
This job sucks.

Yeah, man. It sucks.

You know, there's a whole

There's a whole freaking universe!

Oh, no, you didn't.

01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,206
I quit, too.
