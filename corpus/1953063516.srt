1
00:01:17,565 --> 00:01:18,900
Benedict!

2
00:01:19,114 --> 00:01:20,587
Is it true?

3
00:01:24,123 --> 00:01:25,860
They've found the boy?

4
00:01:27,161 --> 00:01:28,434
Yes.

5
00:01:30,426 --> 00:01:33,486
It's not safe here.
- Nonsense! this is a fortress.

6
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:37,484
The full resources of the order
are at our the disposal.

7
00:01:38,525 --> 00:01:40,558
Respectfully, Benedict...

8
00:01:40,846 --> 00:01:42,794
The Devil himself wants this child.

9
00:01:42,946 --> 00:01:45,478
There is only one place that is safe.....
that is The Sanctuary.

10
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:47,693
<i>The Rider must take him.</i>

11
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:50,135
You do enjoy your wine Moreau

12
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:54,198
If in few days the winter solstice will be pass
and with it the hour of the prophecy.

13
00:01:54,736 --> 00:01:57,101
And the boy would be
no use to the anyone.

14
00:01:57,647 --> 00:01:59,165
By that time, Brother...

15
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,246
You will all be dead.

16
00:02:02,187 --> 00:02:04,371
This conversation is finished.

Nadya....

20
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:05,855
I can help you.

21
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:10,575
Danny, I can protect you.....

22
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,599
Where are they?

23
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:27,812
Shut up!

24
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:37,416
Perfect.

25
00:03:59,127 --> 00:04:00,609
Who is this guy?

26
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:16,332
Stupid ass.

27
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:20,959
Get down.

28
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:48,091
<i>It doesn't matter how far you run.</i>

29
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:52,323
<i>There are some demons, you just can't escape.</i>

30
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:54,491
<i>My name is Johnny Blaze.</i>

31
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,991
<i>I used to ride motorcycle
for a living.</i>

32
00:04:58,073 --> 00:05:03,618
<i>I did a bare ass '360 triple back flip'
in front of twenty two thousand people.</i>

33
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:07,203
<i>It's kind of funny,
it's on Youtube check it out.</i>

34
00:05:07,758 --> 00:05:12,914
<i>But when my dad got sick,
I did something way crazier then that.</i>

35
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:18,552
GHOST RIDER
<font color="#FF3300">Spirit Of Vengeance</font>

36
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:20,867
<i>You look like you could use a little help.</i>

37
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:24,018
<i>Are you willing to make a deal?
John...</i>

38
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:27,552
<i>Atta boy.</i>

39
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:30,151
Do it! Save his life.
Do it!

40
00:05:30,152 --> 00:05:31,152
<i>Yeah, that is right.</i>

41
00:05:30,989 --> 00:05:35,944
<i>I am the guy who made the deal with the devil.</i>

42
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:36,945
<i>I know what you're thinking?</i>

43
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:37,946
<i>Doesn’t this kid watch movies?
Does this ever workout for anyone?</i>

44
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:45,946
<i>Let's just say good judgment
was not exactly my 'Forte'.</i>

45
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:48,722
<i>I was possessed by an ancient demon.</i>

46
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:52,308
<i>In the presence of evil.
I change, into a monster.</i>

47
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,748
<i>And I prey on the wicked....</i>

48
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:58,043
<i>And ...I suck out their soul's.</i>

49
00:05:58,647 --> 00:06:01,004
<i>You don't wanna be around
when that happens.</i>

50
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:03,545
<i>See, there's good and bad in all of us.</i>

51
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:05,330
<i>May be I am not a murderer.</i>

52
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,642
<i>But you did something.</i>

53
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,124
<i>You wouldn't want the ragged to see.</i>

54
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,385
<i>A white lie.</i>

55
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:13,453
<i>An illegal download.</i>

56
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:14,892
<i>What about you?</i>

57
00:06:14,893 --> 00:06:15,893
<i>And you?</i>

58
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,919
<i>After I defied it..
to hold it back.</i>

59
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:23,278
<i>But the darkness inside me...</i>

60
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,167
<i>Only get's stronger.</i>

61
00:06:26,396 --> 00:06:27,832
<i>That's why I had to run.</i>

62
00:06:29,383 --> 00:06:31,760
<i>Half way across the world.</i>

63
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:36,362
<i>And I am still running....</i>

64
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,798
Who are you?

65
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:01,962
My name is Moreau.

66
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:04,808
My brother are dead as should I be.

67
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,458
If not for the intervention of God.

68
00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:12,606
And you are Johnny Blaze.

69
00:07:12,976 --> 00:07:14,243
Go away.

70
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:19,698
I can't do that.

71
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:36,212
Uh huh...

72
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:39,108
It likes the dark places.

73
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:41,339
I don't know
what you're talking about.

74
00:07:44,237 --> 00:07:45,327
You are a rider.

75
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:55,064
The ghost says you could control it.

76
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:57,563
Make it work for you, huh?

77
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:58,886
That you...

78
00:07:59,217 --> 00:08:02,904
Was stronger then
this deep hungry thing.

79
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:04,374
This sickness.

80
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,991
Why are you here?

81
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:07,992
What do you want from me?

82
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,023
I need your help.

83
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,466
And you need your soul.

84
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,348
So we make a deal.

85
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,590
You know about making deals,
don't you Johnny.

86
00:08:23,888 --> 00:08:25,120
Nice bike.

87
00:08:30,402 --> 00:08:31,248
This child..

88
00:08:33,437 --> 00:08:34,401
He is in danger.

89
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,786
And for more than his life.

90
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:38,499
you will...

91
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:40,085
will save him.

92
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,311
I don't.....

93
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:48,038
save.......

94
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:49,702
People.

95
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:56,219
Watch....
what you out here Johnny Blaze!

96
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:59,683
Thousands of miles from your place of birth.

97
00:09:00,677 --> 00:09:01,801
And your dark rebirth.

98
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:04,759
You were brought here.

99
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:06,104
For this.

100
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,059
This little kid.

101
00:09:09,747 --> 00:09:10,876
What makes you think I can find him?

102
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,747
This men that you met
years ago, that put the curse on you.

103
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:17,844
Roarke.

104
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,772
The devil has many names.

105
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:23,702
He is the link the connects you to this child.

106
00:09:24,203 --> 00:09:28,304
Let the rider follow his stench
and will lead you to the boy.

107
00:09:29,064 --> 00:09:31,127
You said something about a deal.

108
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:33,204
The church of my masters,

109
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:34,993
Is in ancient one.

110
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:38,384
We are prepared to give to you.

111
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:41,747
The one thing you want most of this world.

112
00:09:43,343 --> 00:09:45,301
Bring us the boy.

113
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:47,818
And we will lift your curse.

114
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,825
Hello.

00:10:14,826 --> 00:10:15,826

Somebody's gonna have
a lot of explaining to do.

136
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:33,394
We are not always
gonna have to do this, okay?

137
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:38,763
I wanna a make a life for you.

138
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:41,350

So many times i've tried to keep
the rider from coming out. But tonight...

142
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,377
I need him.

143
00:12:42,604 --> 00:12:44,133
What happened?

144
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,342
Hold on.

145
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,645
Stay in there and lock the doors.

146
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:50,676
Nadya....

147
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,465
It's been longtime, Pumpkin.

148
00:14:03,391 --> 00:14:04,352
Carrigan.

149
00:14:05,481 --> 00:14:07,849
I see you're still unbelievable pain in ass.

150
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:11,066
Look... I've got
people after Danny and me.

151
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,067
So just let me go.

Don't touch him.
Get off.

156
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,601
Ohh! Unbelievable.

I know.

163
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:11,149
But he is not mine.

164
00:15:14,222 --> 00:15:16,725
Part of you had to know that might end up like this.

165
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,752
Well... Kill it.

166
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,860

It's funny, cause.

00:19:38,865 --> 00:19:42,810
When you walked in...
I, uhh... I thought, I was still dreaming.

177
00:19:43,372 --> 00:19:44,544
You have hallucinating?

178
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:46,782
No....
No madam. I am not hallucinating.

179
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:48,992
Look...

180
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:51,401
You're beautiful.

00:19:54,424 --> 00:19:56,270
Morphine.

182
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,521
You got any Morphine?

185
00:20:01,723 --> 00:20:02,820
Your wound's....

186
00:20:03,697 --> 00:20:04,870
Very weird Mister.

187
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:08,988
The polizia want to talk to you
when you wake up... no.

188
00:20:09,646 --> 00:20:11,182
I'll tell them you awake.
No.

189
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:13,404
Please.

190
00:20:35,313 --> 00:20:38,036
I'm fine. let me go!
No you should take some rest.

191
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,619
Take a piss.

192
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,538
Carrigan.

193
00:21:24,865 --> 00:21:27,854
I got your package but the cost of
doing business with me just went up.

194
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:29,738
I don't understand.

195
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:31,154
What's not so understand?

196
00:21:32,144 --> 00:21:33,352
I want more.

197
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:35,652
You understand that?

198
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:36,653
We had an agreement carrigan.

199
00:21:37,677 --> 00:21:41,289
Changing the defines term
of agreement is something we just don't do.

200
00:21:42,156 --> 00:21:43,880
You told me to get a kid.

201
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,236
Not a problem.

202
00:21:45,752 --> 00:21:46,983
I've done that for people before.

203
00:21:48,028 --> 00:21:50,180
And I have a history
with his bitch of a mom.

204
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:52,226
So there's no better guy for the job.

205
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:56,554
But what you didn’t tell me?
Is that I be walking into middle goddamn horror movie!

206
00:21:58,898 --> 00:22:00,077
How this is funny to you?

207
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:04,040
Three of my guy's get turned into match stick last night.

208
00:22:04,778 --> 00:22:07,628
By a dude on the motorcycle....
with his head on fire.

209
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,567
Come again.
- You heard me.

210
00:22:14,138 --> 00:22:16,412
I've seen thing's, weird thing's, bad thing's.

211
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,676
But that thing last night.

212
00:22:19,937 --> 00:22:21,297
No... no... no..... no.

213
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,202
Put the boy on the phone.

214
00:22:25,355 --> 00:22:26,394
Talk.

215
00:22:27,143 --> 00:22:28,082
Talk.

216
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,083
Danny?

217
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,948
Do you hear me?

218
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:36,442
I want you to listen very closely.
listen to me danny...

219
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:03,086
What the hell was that?

220
00:23:03,121 --> 00:23:06,010
Think of the child was sort of computer.

221
00:23:06,714 --> 00:23:08,080
You know computers, right?

222
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,986
I just upload it a little program.

223
00:23:12,205 --> 00:23:14,205
A Firewall.

224
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,601
Our friend on the motorcycle won't be able to
sense him now..to track him.

225
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:20,935
Of course.

226
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,329
He is still maybe able to find you.
so......

227
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:25,495
I suggest to you keep moving.

228
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:29,622
Hello.

229
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,281
Who sent you to find me?

230
00:24:31,073 --> 00:24:32,129
Is it the Devil?

231
00:24:32,857 --> 00:24:33,965
The Devil walk's among man?

232
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:37,002
Does the Devil?
Own you answer me.

233
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:38,607
The kid.

234
00:24:39,356 --> 00:24:40,523
Danny.

235
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,058
He is you're son?

236
00:24:45,311 --> 00:24:47,052
Bullets can't hurt you anymore
Could the Demon?

237
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,636
But,I'm think they've gonna do!

238
00:24:52,478 --> 00:24:53,627
Tell me why I can trust you.

239
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,144
You can't!

240
00:24:57,376 --> 00:24:58,937
But if I, don't find your son?

241
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:01,983
I just assumed he'd be dead.

242
00:25:03,765 --> 00:25:05,366
So if you wanna pull that trigger.

243
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:09,465
Do it.

244
00:25:11,336 --> 00:25:12,293
Please.

245
00:25:21,265 --> 00:25:22,482
You tracked us last night.

246
00:25:24,474 --> 00:25:25,834
Can you do it again?

247
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:29,629
I could feel him before.

248
00:25:30,555 --> 00:25:33,305
I could sense him, and then
nothing.

249
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,262
No no.He is not dead.
he is just....

250
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,501
Blocked.

251
00:25:45,363 --> 00:25:46,793
But you know something.

252
00:25:50,413 --> 00:25:51,960
Let's go.

253
00:25:54,689 --> 00:25:57,791
Yeah okay, let me just get something straight....
The guy who kidnapped danny....

254
00:25:57,792 --> 00:25:58,792
And try to kill you.....
blew me up.

255
00:26:01,464 --> 00:26:02,596
With grenades.

256
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,407
You two were like boyfriend and girlfriend?

257
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:11,741
Carrigan was a gunrunner...
a drug dealer and a mercenary.....

258
00:26:12,825 --> 00:26:14,989
I didn’t care about any of that.....
I just searched to get out.

259
00:26:15,418 --> 00:26:17,364
Right ok!
so danny.... is.

260
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,385
Danny what?
Is he was Carrigan's son?

261
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:22,535
No.

262
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,176
When you met the seducer?

263
00:26:27,842 --> 00:26:29,705
He offered you something?
yeah!..

264
00:26:30,738 --> 00:26:32,192
My father's life.

265
00:26:33,715 --> 00:26:34,923
Shocker.
He lied.

266
00:26:35,612 --> 00:26:37,019
For me....
It was only myself.

267
00:26:39,657 --> 00:26:42,148
It was supposed to be big scoff in Carrigan, but he want bad.....

268
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,351
I made it out of third floor in a rental.

269
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:47,723
I was choking on my own blood.

270
00:26:49,177 --> 00:26:50,391
I knew!
I was gonna die.

271
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:52,331
I could feel it.

272
00:26:52,332 --> 00:26:53,332
And that's when he found me....

273
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:56,355
<i>You look like you could use a little help?</i>

274
00:26:59,906 --> 00:27:01,002
Roarke.

275
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,522
He promise to take the pain away.

276
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:05,315
To save my life.

277
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,917
But he ask for something in return.

278
00:27:12,395 --> 00:27:13,473
Your son?

279
00:27:14,604 --> 00:27:16,132
Maybe you can never understand.

280
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:17,505
No.....
I get it.

281
00:27:17,506 --> 00:27:18,506
You are the Devil's baby mama.

282
00:27:20,864 --> 00:27:23,266
I guess that explains why? Moreau wants....

283
00:27:24,714 --> 00:27:26,166
Danny.
So bad.

284
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:27,719
Moreau?

285
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,187
Yeah...... Black, French, Alcoholic-
Priest, he's kind of a Dick. Why? you know him?

286
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,001
He tried to help us I didn’t let him.

287
00:27:35,168 --> 00:27:37,284
We were both gonna work on our decision making.

288
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:40,016
Where are you headed?

289
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:41,532
Someone, I know.

290
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:44,778
He does Carrigan's dirty book.
He'll know where to find him.

291
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:54,724
Why does the Devil walk
on earth in human form anyway?

292
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,141
I have no idea.

293
00:27:58,096 --> 00:27:59,232
Maybe he doesn’t know either.

294
00:28:00,142 --> 00:28:02,517
Maybe he's just.....
Passes on from body to body.

295
00:28:02,518 --> 00:28:03,518
Down through history...

296
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:05,519
Waiting for the perfect fit.

297
00:28:07,066 --> 00:28:08,215
But! I know one thing.....

298
00:28:08,995 --> 00:28:09,875
on earth.

299
00:28:09,876 --> 00:28:10,876
He's weak.

300
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,571
His powers are limited.

301
00:28:13,031 --> 00:28:15,418
He need's innocent emissaries.

302
00:28:15,655 --> 00:28:16,709
To do his dirty work.

303
00:28:17,407 --> 00:28:18,546
So he find's them or make's them.

304
00:28:19,472 --> 00:28:20,773
Using his greatest power.....

305
00:28:21,705 --> 00:28:23,066
The power of....

306
00:28:24,772 --> 00:28:25,951
The Deal.

307
00:28:36,946 --> 00:28:38,124
Can I open a window?

308
00:28:40,663 --> 00:28:41,946
Do you think you can just talk?

309
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:45,393
You know, your mom thought she could just talk.

310
00:28:46,395 --> 00:28:47,791
Until, I get doing your gypsy face.

311
00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:43,283
Carrigan get me out of here.

312
00:29:43,895 --> 00:29:45,512
Enjoy yourself in the twinkies cell.

313
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:46,325
Get me out of here.

314
00:29:49,472 --> 00:29:50,432
Boss.

315
00:30:17,328 --> 00:30:18,451
Come here.

316
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,888
You try that again....
you will return.....

317
00:30:23,147 --> 00:30:24,041
What?

318
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,431
You speak English?

319
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:29,305
Yeah! Dude! what happened?

320
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:31,403
Is that your Van?

321
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:35,446
Ohh! Yeah.

322
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:37,351
Is it in run?
Yeah.

323
00:31:12,587 --> 00:31:14,314
When we get over...
go ahead.

324
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,738
The Rider's going to come out.

325
00:31:17,897 --> 00:31:19,017
When he does.

326
00:31:20,317 --> 00:31:23,465
He'll destroy whoever got it coming.

327
00:31:25,563 --> 00:31:26,477
Nadya.....

328
00:31:27,397 --> 00:31:28,357
This thing......

329
00:31:29,832 --> 00:31:31,245
There is no reason....

330
00:31:32,143 --> 00:31:33,208
Of conscious.

331
00:31:34,071 --> 00:31:35,471
Just hunger.

332
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,118
And in his eye's.

333
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,915
You're not different than Carrigan?

334
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,763
You are not different than any of them.

335
00:31:48,245 --> 00:31:49,389
I'm not afraid of you.

336
00:31:49,424 --> 00:31:51,675
Yeah?

337
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:52,606
Maybe, you should be.

338
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:10,835
That's the guy?

339
00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:13,366
Look's like he work's on a crew ship.

340
00:32:14,846 --> 00:32:17,337
Am I gonna regret taking you?

341
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:18,805
Um...

342
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:20,868
Yeah. Probably.

343
00:32:26,615 --> 00:32:27,778
Count every dollar.

344
00:32:28,495 --> 00:32:29,758
I don't want these idiots robbing me.

345
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:32,037
Everyone's robbing me!

346
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:38,992
Hello, vasil.

347
00:32:42,684 --> 00:32:44,066
Long time Nadya You look good.

348
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:46,198
Shut up just shut up.

349
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,641
He's been talking to Carrigan.
last couple of day's and few hour's ago.

350
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:54,641
John.

351
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,497
You talked to Carrigan?

352
00:32:58,498 --> 00:32:59,498
I've talked with lot of people.

353
00:33:00,158 --> 00:33:01,787
Hey, i've got what your need for your shake's my friend?

354
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:07,558
Carrigan must told you about that thing?

355
00:33:08,308 --> 00:33:09,550
that kills his men last night, huh?

356
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,623
Yeah!

357
00:33:10,624 --> 00:33:11,624
That thing is inside of me.

358
00:33:12,944 --> 00:33:14,679
See you are bad man.

359
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:18,561
And this thing, The Rider he feeds
on them and he is hungry!

360
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:20,984
He's hunger thats been year's
and that's why I am shaking.

361
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:25,634
Cause right now.. the only thing that's standing
between you and the rider is me.

362
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,900
He is just...
he just....

363
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:33,647
He is creeping at the door.
He's creeping at the door.

364
00:33:37,547 --> 00:33:39,049
Who might if you don’t tell me what I wanna to know.

365
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:41,343
I am gonna let him out.

366
00:33:45,945 --> 00:33:47,131
I want to stand with you.

367
00:33:47,132 --> 00:33:49,201
You won't be anything left!
Do you understand?

368
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,425
Do you understand?
Shake your head yes or no?

369
00:33:53,296 --> 00:33:54,236
Good.
good girl.

370
00:33:55,391 --> 00:33:56,286
Where is Carrigan?

371
00:33:58,138 --> 00:34:00,708
I want the kid.
The kid and Carrigan.

372
00:34:00,743 --> 00:34:04,588
You will tell me or
I'm gonna eat your stinking soul!

373
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:05,589
The quarry..?

374
00:34:09,463 --> 00:34:10,348
I know the place.

375
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:15,205
You are not gonna exhibit
this conversation to anyone, are you?

376
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,832
Oh! Yeah all right. That's a good answer.

377
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:20,123
Good girl!
John.

378
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:23,916
We gotta go.
We gotta go.

379
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:49,912
FGM 148 Javelin.

380
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:54,461
Lock on fire and forget.

381
00:35:58,054 --> 00:35:59,640
American Bunker buster.

382
00:36:00,509 --> 00:36:01,747
Two stage detonation.

383
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,098
The first's creates super vacuum.

384
00:36:05,482 --> 00:36:07,208
It's suck's the oxygen from the air.

385
00:36:09,443 --> 00:36:10,797
The next!
- I know what it does.

386
00:36:11,976 --> 00:36:13,645
Give me four of them with extra heads.

387
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,330
How many men you go up against?

388
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:18,268
Just one.

389
00:36:25,633 --> 00:36:26,484
Danny.

390
00:36:27,617 --> 00:36:28,502
Mom.

391
00:36:29,097 --> 00:36:29,921
Are you ok?

392
00:36:30,825 --> 00:36:32,926
I am so sorry I am so sorry.

393
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,914
I am gonna get you out of here.

394
00:36:39,536 --> 00:36:40,564
I think my ankle is broken.

395
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:42,178
Come on, hold on.

396
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,648
Come on.
Hold on to me.

397
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,081
Show time.

398
00:37:24,014 --> 00:37:24,931
What is it?

399
00:37:26,085 --> 00:37:27,012
I don't care.

400
00:37:28,184 --> 00:37:30,815
Give me that thing.
Give it to me.

401
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:58,281
That was awesome.

402
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:13,732
Hey!
Would you Reload.

403
00:38:31,169 --> 00:38:32,102
Throw the grenade.

404
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:05,335
Give me that.

405
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:33,477
I'm sorry did that hurt?

406
00:39:35,028 --> 00:39:36,101
You look like it did.

407
00:41:34,478 --> 00:41:35,942
Sorry...

408
00:41:35,943 --> 00:41:38,114
Does it hurt?

409
00:41:38,115 --> 00:41:40,986
It's look like It does.

410
00:41:40,992 --> 00:41:43,376
What are you waiting for?
Do it. Do it.

411
00:41:57,696 --> 00:41:58,786
He is coming.

412
00:42:24,264 --> 00:42:25,286
Let me go.

413
00:42:35,818 --> 00:42:40,602
Enough, let her go

414
00:43:25,862 --> 00:43:28,100
So, that happened.

415
00:43:56,539 --> 00:43:57,758
There you go.

416
00:44:04,721 --> 00:44:05,934
It was a bee.

417
00:44:06,803 --> 00:44:09,656
I thought it was gonna...
sting your face.

418
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:12,668
Why you feeling better?

419
00:44:15,634 --> 00:44:17,220
Your leg's all heal huh?

420
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,037
Like all by it self.

421
00:44:21,453 --> 00:44:22,532
That's weird.

422
00:44:25,258 --> 00:44:26,245
Where's my mom?

423
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:28,416
She is gassing up the truck.

424
00:44:31,765 --> 00:44:33,071
I know that is.

425
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,329
Little awkward.

426
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,452
I mean Rolling with you guy's.

427
00:44:38,169 --> 00:44:39,289
I mean, after everything.

428
00:44:40,251 --> 00:44:42,787
Dude, you way cooler than the guys
she usually hang's up.

429
00:44:44,297 --> 00:44:45,148
Huh!

430
00:44:47,024 --> 00:44:47,882
Hey!

431
00:45:04,029 --> 00:45:05,603
So, what's next?

432
00:45:05,638 --> 00:45:09,240
Ugh! Moreau seems to think
the danger pass in a few day's..

433
00:45:09,241 --> 00:45:10,241
And if we just get Danny in someplace safe.

434
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:14,578
A Holy place where's people can protect us,
where we can ride it out.

435
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:15,579
That's where we are headed.

436
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,580
Ok.

437
00:45:16,869 --> 00:45:20,392
I've already contacted with Moreau
He's gonna catch up with us on the road.

438
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:25,713
We gotta move fast.

439
00:45:26,367 --> 00:45:27,692
Cause the one that's hunting us.

440
00:45:28,464 --> 00:45:29,603
They are not done.

441
00:45:32,133 --> 00:45:34,479
Of course I have some personal issue's
I kinda like to get fixed.

442
00:45:46,733 --> 00:45:48,458
Your not done...
Carrigan.

443
00:45:49,969 --> 00:45:51,981
You are the bring me Nadya's son.

444
00:45:53,285 --> 00:45:56,181
I do expect you to fulfill your obligation.

445
00:45:58,457 --> 00:46:02,795
S.... S....S......
sorry, jackass.

446
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:07,850
But I am dead

447
00:46:12,257 --> 00:46:13,691
Inconvenient.

448
00:47:03,366 --> 00:47:04,488
What you do to me?

449
00:47:06,819 --> 00:47:08,717
Gave you a second chance.

450
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:12,312
You a little less than alive, now.

451
00:47:15,521 --> 00:47:17,233
But also more!

452
00:47:19,407 --> 00:47:20,738
See..

453
00:47:20,739 --> 00:47:21,739
I've giving you the power.

454
00:47:23,827 --> 00:47:28,015
The power of decay.

455
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:32,951
Of darkness.

456
00:48:08,817 --> 00:48:10,985
I want that boy Carrigan.

457
00:48:12,509 --> 00:48:15,391
Now you've got no excuses.

458
00:48:21,152 --> 00:48:22,490
The machine last night.

459
00:48:23,955 --> 00:48:25,100
Yeah.
You made it change.

460
00:48:26,415 --> 00:48:29,061
Thats how it works.
Whatever he rides changes with him.

461
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,596
But, what if you took the taxi?

462
00:48:33,752 --> 00:48:34,757
Ugh..

463
00:48:34,758 --> 00:48:35,758
I don't know!
I don't know.

464
00:48:37,136 --> 00:48:40,065
Or a Rollercoaster or ski lift or..

465
00:48:40,066 --> 00:48:41,066
- Dude.

466
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:44,728
Hey! What if you have to pee
when you're on fire?

467
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,301
Oh, it's awesome.

468
00:48:48,302 --> 00:48:50,268
It's like a Flame thrower.
You know, It's like..

469
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:13,891
When you change..

470
00:49:13,892 --> 00:49:15,387
When you're him-

471
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,483
Does it feel good?

472
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,887
Sometimes.

473
00:49:24,527 --> 00:49:25,385
What does that mean?

474
00:49:25,386 --> 00:49:26,386
All you just bad?

475
00:49:28,458 --> 00:49:29,662
No.

476
00:49:32,587 --> 00:49:33,895
This power that we have,

477
00:49:33,896 --> 00:49:34,896
comes from the dark place.

478
00:49:36,053 --> 00:49:37,313
But it's not who we are.

479
00:49:38,926 --> 00:49:39,961
and never will be...

480
00:49:40,704 --> 00:49:42,164
And we can use it to do good.

481
00:49:43,462 --> 00:49:44,384
To help people.

482
00:49:47,434 --> 00:49:48,754
Like I am helping you and your mom.

483
00:49:50,652 --> 00:49:51,908
I know why are you helping us.

484
00:49:53,134 --> 00:49:54,412
She say's you wanna get rid of it.

485
00:49:56,682 --> 00:49:57,750
I can't never do that.

486
00:50:03,827 --> 00:50:04,948
Blazer!

487
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:08,733
Hey Nadya.....

488
00:50:08,734 --> 00:50:11,766
I hope you have finished
shooting at me.

489
00:50:17,564 --> 00:50:18,424
Hey!

490
00:50:18,425 --> 00:50:19,425
You wanna have some fun?

491
00:50:37,856 --> 00:50:39,399
You gotta hang on.

492
00:51:34,952 --> 00:51:36,359
That's so weird.

493
00:52:28,683 --> 00:52:30,602
So, this is it.
Moreau's happy place.

494
00:52:32,687 --> 00:52:34,411
I mean this guy's gonna lift my curse.

495
00:52:35,516 --> 00:52:37,023
They donn't even have shoes.

496
00:52:39,761 --> 00:52:40,952
Sunger.

497
00:53:06,958 --> 00:53:08,249
You mustn't be afraid.

498
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,250
It was God that
let you here.

499
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:16,854
What's up?

500
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,498
I know.

501
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:23,499
A little to uptight.

502
00:53:24,387 --> 00:53:25,958
But, not so bad
when you get to know them.

503
00:53:27,641 --> 00:53:28,470
Go on.

504
00:53:29,891 --> 00:53:31,006
They will take good care of you.

505
00:53:31,937 --> 00:53:33,038
What about you two?

506
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:34,598
Oh, We will join you later.

507
00:53:35,557 --> 00:53:37,275
We have some business to complete between us.

508
00:53:38,421 --> 00:53:39,892
I made promise to you, John.

509
00:53:44,237 --> 00:53:45,354
Why can't he come with us?

510
00:53:46,482 --> 00:53:47,265
No.

511
00:53:48,011 --> 00:53:50,033
Danny.
Danny.

512
00:53:50,837 --> 00:53:52,030
You're safe here.

513
00:53:52,031 --> 00:53:53,031
We made it.

514
00:53:54,514 --> 00:53:58,032
The only thing that can hurt you
and your mom now...

515
00:53:58,033 --> 00:53:59,033
is me.

516
00:54:01,107 --> 00:54:02,984
I need to make sure that will never happen.

517
00:54:05,098 --> 00:54:06,360
It will be alright.

518
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:08,583
I promise.

519
00:54:10,207 --> 00:54:11,078
Whatever.
Come on.

520
00:54:16,926 --> 00:54:18,088
Are you sure about this?

521
00:54:21,104 --> 00:54:22,069
Come on.

522
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,149
Where are we going?

523
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:26,150
To my favorite woman.

524
00:54:28,033 --> 00:54:30,750
If there's one thing this sons of bitch's know, huh.

525
00:54:31,578 --> 00:54:32,610
It's wine.

526
00:54:37,032 --> 00:54:40,192
This bottle was fetch fifty thousand Euro's at an auction.

527
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:44,630
Moreau.
Oh.Yeah.

528
00:54:45,354 --> 00:54:46,319
What is it?

529
00:54:46,973 --> 00:54:48,271
It's........
It's thing inside of me.

530
00:54:49,469 --> 00:54:51,363
I would like to know before we..

531
00:54:51,364 --> 00:54:52,364
commence.

532
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,947
Zarathos,

533
00:54:58,948 --> 00:55:01,080
was an angel.

534
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:03,896
A Spirit of justice.

535
00:55:08,997 --> 00:55:11,393
Sent to protect the world of men.

536
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:13,339
But....

537
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,340
He was tricked....

538
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:17,669
captured.

539
00:55:19,195 --> 00:55:20,622
Brought down to hell.

540
00:55:21,737 --> 00:55:22,825
Corrupted.

541
00:55:29,197 --> 00:55:30,179
Driven insane.

542
00:55:34,841 --> 00:55:40,066
His mission to protect the innocent was
perverted into a lust of punish.

543
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,557
The Guilty, he became

544
00:55:44,638 --> 00:55:46,298
The spirit of vengeance.

545
00:55:47,607 --> 00:55:48,636
But the angel?

546
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,599
Spirit justice.

547
00:55:51,645 --> 00:55:53,055
He's alive in there,

548
00:55:53,967 --> 00:55:54,790
Somewhere.

549
00:55:55,905 --> 00:55:56,895
It could be.

550
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,130
Do you feel him?

551
00:56:07,837 --> 00:56:09,035
No.

552
00:56:12,074 --> 00:56:13,184
Cheer up my man.

553
00:56:13,816 --> 00:56:15,026
Soon you will be free.

554
00:56:16,943 --> 00:56:17,955
This bottle....

555
00:56:20,695 --> 00:56:23,974
This one......
is over two thousand years old.

556
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,301
I've had my eye on it for while.

557
00:56:32,651 --> 00:56:33,667
When this is over....

558
00:56:37,168 --> 00:56:38,318
We will share it too.

559
00:56:42,302 --> 00:56:43,430
There is something else.

560
00:56:46,175 --> 00:56:49,644
This thing that, work done to you
is not easily undone.

561
00:56:51,522 --> 00:56:53,001
You risk of death.

562
00:56:54,608 --> 00:56:55,866
Worse than that.

563
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,702
You must confess,

564
00:57:02,703 --> 00:57:07,366
the one thing...
that is most difficult for you to talk about.

565
00:57:23,834 --> 00:57:24,797
My dad..

566
00:57:26,975 --> 00:57:28,161
I didn’t do it for him.

567
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,018
I made the deal from me.

568
00:57:35,547 --> 00:57:36,652
I couldn’t let him go.

569
00:57:38,948 --> 00:57:40,101
I was selfish.

570
00:57:43,082 --> 00:57:44,525
He was ready to die.

571
00:57:46,331 --> 00:57:47,717
He knew it was HIS time.

572
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:50,783
And I thought, I could change that.

573
00:57:53,207 --> 00:57:54,011
I'm sorry.

574
00:58:04,853 --> 00:58:07,560
This is the lamb of God.

575
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:11,837
That take's away all the sin from the world.

576
00:58:14,803 --> 00:58:17,321
<i>Happy are those that are called to receive him.</i>

577
00:58:20,525 --> 00:58:22,846
Would you say that,
you're not worthy to receive him?

578
00:58:22,881 --> 00:58:23,320
I am not.

579
00:58:23,321 --> 00:58:26,116
Ok. That's, that's good enough.

580
00:58:28,769 --> 00:58:29,923
The body of Christ.

581
00:58:32,856 --> 00:58:33,774
Amen.

582
00:58:38,212 --> 00:58:41,538
Been carrying this bread around for while?

583
00:58:45,757 --> 00:58:47,134
May God..

584
00:58:47,135 --> 00:58:50,640
lead you into the eternal life.

585
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:55,861
That is John, if today is in fact-
your last.

586
00:58:58,871 --> 00:59:00,125
Where you go now...

587
00:59:00,126 --> 00:59:01,994
I can not follow.

588
00:59:02,866 --> 00:59:03,977
Are you ready?

589
00:59:11,529 --> 00:59:12,431
Hello.

590
00:59:16,414 --> 00:59:17,409
Hello.

591
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:34,936
Make it quick,
you assholes!

592
00:59:40,644 --> 00:59:41,961
Make the deal.

593
01:00:27,788 --> 01:00:28,818
Moraeu.

594
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:31,273
Moraeu.

595
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:34,390
Moraeu.

596
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:36,476
Moraeu.

597
01:00:37,856 --> 01:00:38,969
You did it.

598
01:00:41,676 --> 01:00:42,722
Moraeu.

599
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:46,987
Moraeu.

600
01:00:49,409 --> 01:00:50,291
It worked.

601
01:00:55,706 --> 01:00:56,434
Hey!

602
01:00:56,435 --> 01:00:57,435
What are you doing?

603
01:00:58,737 --> 01:00:59,658
Let me go.

604
01:01:02,086 --> 01:01:02,978
What are you doing?

605
01:01:04,516 --> 01:01:06,088
What will be done.

606
01:01:10,618 --> 01:01:11,857
The day of Prophecy is tomorrow.

607
01:01:12,758 --> 01:01:14,702
You are to hold the boy
until the danger passes.

608
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,194
The danger will not pass, Moraeu.

609
01:01:18,494 --> 01:01:20,060
As long as the boy exists.

610
01:01:21,205 --> 01:01:23,533
The power will
always be inside him.

611
01:01:28,541 --> 01:01:29,415
You lied to me.

612
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:31,207
You lied to me!

613
01:01:32,575 --> 01:01:34,802
This child must be destroyed.

614
01:01:38,619 --> 01:01:42,409
You might have protested while the child was been conceived.

615
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:45,255
Now, It is too late.

616
01:01:54,409 --> 01:01:58,102
Take them away
until the thing is done.

617
01:02:02,297 --> 01:02:04,204
Danny's soul can still be saved.

618
01:02:05,087 --> 01:02:06,001
That boy..

619
01:02:06,002 --> 01:02:08,144
is one of the God's children.

620
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:09,698
No.

621
01:02:11,814 --> 01:02:13,079
He is not.

622
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:25,135
Pretty neat, huh?

623
01:03:41,388 --> 01:03:42,527
Peace... brother.

624
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:00,617
Damn.

625
01:04:01,939 --> 01:04:03,407
Bet you're happy to see me.

626
01:04:31,773 --> 01:04:32,751
Did Danny do this?

627
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:34,475
No.

628
01:04:35,593 --> 01:04:37,768
Somebody got here, before they could....
- Before they could kill him.

629
01:04:38,578 --> 01:04:39,655
There's no sign of him.

630
01:04:40,682 --> 01:04:42,354
Whoever did this, wanted him alive.

631
01:04:42,989 --> 01:04:46,452
I think we all have pretty good idea!
who had would be, Moraeu.

632
01:04:47,127 --> 01:04:48,362
Yes, now he is with Roarke.

633
01:04:48,363 --> 01:04:50,676
Some protector
you've turned out to be.

634
01:04:50,711 --> 01:04:53,098
What exactly does Roarke
have in mind for the enemy!

635
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:57,330
What are his plans...
Is he putting money away for college or what?

636
01:04:58,266 --> 01:04:59,530
It is the day of prophecy.

637
01:05:01,179 --> 01:05:03,005
As was the day, Danny was conceived.

638
01:05:04,274 --> 01:05:08,827
The child must be in his 13th year's before the rite
can be performed on the dawn of a new winter.

639
01:05:08,828 --> 01:05:09,828
The Rite.

640
01:05:12,467 --> 01:05:15,989
Roarke favor the boy as a vessel,
As a content of for his power.

641
01:05:16,024 --> 01:05:17,338
The ritual will transform his...

642
01:05:17,339 --> 01:05:18,339
essence.

643
01:05:19,506 --> 01:05:20,742
His soul into the boy.

644
01:05:22,555 --> 01:05:23,850
There will be no more Danny.

645
01:05:24,615 --> 01:05:25,430
Only Roarke.
- No.

646
01:05:26,294 --> 01:05:28,068
Why the hell didn’t you tell us this, Moraeu?

647
01:05:28,103 --> 01:05:29,863
You're the one that made a deal with Roarke.

648
01:05:29,864 --> 01:05:30,864
Both of you.

649
01:05:32,336 --> 01:05:33,486
Something, I would never do.

650
01:05:34,383 --> 01:05:37,402
Alright, the prophecy.
You said, It had to happen at the dawn of a new day.

651
01:05:37,403 --> 01:05:38,403
Well that's good.

652
01:05:38,404 --> 01:05:40,231
Maybe there's still time.
Do you know where Roarke has him?

653
01:05:41,666 --> 01:05:43,205
So what, now you want to play hero?

654
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,228
You got that you wanted.

655
01:05:46,253 --> 01:05:47,355
Yes, I did.

656
01:05:48,725 --> 01:05:50,806
Thank you, for holding up your end of the bargain.

657
01:05:51,441 --> 01:05:52,372
You're welcome.

658
01:05:53,237 --> 01:05:56,923
If I could spend the last day of my life as free man
without the curse hell hanging from my head.

659
01:05:56,924 --> 01:05:57,924
Yeah, I will take that.

660
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:00,606
But, I promised Danny he'd be safe.

661
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:04,833
If I walk away now,
I'm just 'pretty one Demon for another'.

662
01:06:06,745 --> 01:06:07,768
So, let's go.

663
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:38,456
Was there really doubt?
- Don't touch me.

664
01:06:40,647 --> 01:06:42,900
Cutting it a bit close, aren’t we?

665
01:06:47,496 --> 01:06:48,561
Do you have any idea..

666
01:06:48,562 --> 01:06:51,312
what I had to go thorough?

667
01:06:53,399 --> 01:06:54,772
To get this little turd.

668
01:06:57,449 --> 01:07:01,579
Look, the players don't align for your little
Pagan party until daybreak tomorrow.

669
01:07:01,614 --> 01:07:05,161
So, get off my ass,
cause I'd said I'm ahead schedule.

670
01:07:08,198 --> 01:07:09,312
Danny?

671
01:07:11,864 --> 01:07:14,857
Do you know who I am?

672
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:17,965
Well....

673
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:21,401
I'm sure your mother told you a lot of thing's about me.

674
01:07:23,042 --> 01:07:24,347
What's the matter with your face?

675
01:07:31,533 --> 01:07:34,437
Uzak Gökten,
The furthest point from heaven.

676
01:07:35,388 --> 01:07:37,345
That is where the ritual is to take place.

677
01:07:38,126 --> 01:07:39,432
According to the prophecy, of course.

678
01:07:40,854 --> 01:07:41,793
- Of course.

679
01:07:41,794 --> 01:07:46,255
Without The Rider..
We stand little chance against Roarke.

680
01:07:46,256 --> 01:07:48,680
I thought, you're supposed to have faith?
- I do.

681
01:07:49,705 --> 01:07:52,699
But also, I think we should have weapon's.

682
01:07:55,672 --> 01:07:56,499
Gun's...

683
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,771
and wine.

684
01:07:59,954 --> 01:08:01,144
Naughty Priest.

685
01:08:02,879 --> 01:08:04,495
I'm starting to like you again Moraeu.

686
01:08:09,429 --> 01:08:12,123
You wanted to know,
why I look this way?

687
01:08:15,364 --> 01:08:16,849
Think of the...

688
01:08:18,069 --> 01:08:19,346
Flame thrower.

689
01:08:27,772 --> 01:08:28,810
Is that funny?

690
01:08:32,121 --> 01:08:32,980
Ok.

691
01:08:32,981 --> 01:08:36,820
A Flame thrower made out of the paper Mache.

692
01:08:39,627 --> 01:08:41,730
All that power.

693
01:08:43,418 --> 01:08:45,254
Try to use it, you burn up.

694
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:50,037
This body, I'm living in,
Its weak.

695
01:08:51,608 --> 01:08:52,568
Human.

696
01:08:54,299 --> 01:08:55,389
It's dying.

697
01:08:57,184 --> 01:09:00,025
It was never made to do the thing's
that I can do.

698
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:02,258
But you...

699
01:09:02,259 --> 01:09:05,441
You're only part human.

700
01:09:06,532 --> 01:09:10,313
You will have all the power
that I have inside of you.

701
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,094
Like Father Like Son.

702
01:09:13,129 --> 01:09:16,667
But this corporial form...

703
01:09:17,757 --> 01:09:21,442
Can wield the power,
without burning itself up.

704
01:09:30,976 --> 01:09:32,497
To help you relax.

705
01:09:43,027 --> 01:09:45,593
That will keep him sedated until the ceremony.

706
01:10:01,752 --> 01:10:02,783
Who are they?

707
01:10:03,843 --> 01:10:06,909
Politicians, Murderers,
People of influence.

708
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:07,910
the Devil's soldiers.

709
01:10:10,304 --> 01:10:13,930
They've traveled from all over the world,
to witness of the annointing of The New king.

710
01:10:14,329 --> 01:10:15,302
Oh...

711
01:10:15,303 --> 01:10:16,303
The New King.

712
01:10:18,184 --> 01:10:19,415
Please.

713
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:20,837
If Roarke succeeds,

714
01:10:20,838 --> 01:10:24,957
we'll have a new form
One more powerful than is ever known,

715
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,352
And His shadow will fall upon the earth.

716
01:11:16,352 --> 01:11:18,402
25-39..More inside.

717
01:11:19,229 --> 01:11:20,653
The ritual has already begun.

718
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,372
Danny's soul be lost forever at the break of dawn.

719
01:11:25,219 --> 01:11:27,014
This is when Roarke is at his weakest.

720
01:11:31,845 --> 01:11:32,802
Nadya?

721
01:11:42,773 --> 01:11:43,756
You alright?

722
01:11:52,528 --> 01:11:54,311
I've made a lot of mistakes Blaze.

723
01:11:55,922 --> 01:11:56,883
But..Danny...

724
01:12:01,554 --> 01:12:02,931
Danny is the one....

725
01:12:04,822 --> 01:12:06,181
The one good thing...

726
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:10,148
I ever did.

727
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:15,455
That being the case, we..

728
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:19,774
had better make sure he doesn’t
turn out to be the anti-christ.

729
01:13:10,501 --> 01:13:11,946
Not much time?
- What's the plan?

730
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:15,243
I need you go and grab the boy,
you run and you don't stop.

731
01:13:16,028 --> 01:13:16,880
What about you?

732
01:13:18,283 --> 01:13:19,170
Me?

733
01:13:20,542 --> 01:13:21,619
I'm going for the front.

734
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:24,745
Okay.

735
01:13:30,248 --> 01:13:31,198
Not bad.

736
01:13:35,483 --> 01:13:36,736
This is my big honor.

737
01:13:39,403 --> 01:13:40,504
Johnny Blaze.

738
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:45,254
Bona me

739
01:13:45,289 --> 01:13:45,884
Go.

740
01:13:52,711 --> 01:13:54,396
Bonjour.

741
01:13:59,289 --> 01:14:00,369
Catch this one, huh.

742
01:14:03,684 --> 01:14:04,920
What a waste of good wine.

743
01:14:06,819 --> 01:14:07,722
Merde!

744
01:15:18,414 --> 01:15:19,446
That felt good.

745
01:15:45,091 --> 01:15:46,269
Okay, you listen to me?

746
01:15:46,304 --> 01:15:49,318
We should've never of gone rid of the power,
I know that now.

747
01:15:50,105 --> 01:15:51,581
He is gonna erase you Danny.

748
01:16:12,899 --> 01:16:13,931
Moraeu.

749
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,579
I can still see the light.

750
01:16:34,345 --> 01:16:35,968
That's gross.

751
01:16:36,743 --> 01:16:38,458
You have no power Blaze!

752
01:16:38,459 --> 01:16:41,620
You're nothing but an insect.

753
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:42,621
Like the rest.

754
01:16:43,942 --> 01:16:45,850
Food for the meals of hell.

755
01:17:20,659 --> 01:17:21,894
Oh, you wanna watch?

756
01:17:28,047 --> 01:17:30,321
The apple doesn’t rot far from the tree.

757
01:17:33,951 --> 01:17:35,127
Danny.

758
01:17:38,291 --> 01:17:41,080
This is not who you are.

759
01:17:44,257 --> 01:17:45,337
It never will be.

760
01:17:50,864 --> 01:17:52,188
My powers and yours are the same.

761
01:17:52,223 --> 01:17:54,208
That's what you said.

762
01:17:55,706 --> 01:17:56,447
Right.

763
01:17:57,385 --> 01:17:58,387
Dad?

764
01:18:00,002 --> 01:18:01,251
Like Father, Like Son.

765
01:18:22,062 --> 01:18:22,565
Do it.

766
01:18:30,347 --> 01:18:31,816
No.

767
01:21:57,523 --> 01:21:58,489
Come here.

768
01:23:15,058 --> 01:23:17,441
I was never afraid of you.

769
01:23:40,143 --> 01:23:41,341
Road kill.

770
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:09,593
You are the worst fucking deal,
I ever made.

771
01:25:17,623 --> 01:25:19,749
Go home.

772
01:26:02,653 --> 01:26:03,542
Danny.

773
01:27:27,496 --> 01:27:28,578
The Angel.

774
01:27:30,549 --> 01:27:33,377
Moraeu says, The Rider was an Angel.

775
01:27:33,408 --> 01:27:34,917
That went crazy.

776
01:27:37,737 --> 01:27:38,897
I can feel him.

777
01:27:39,786 --> 01:27:40,869
The Angel.

778
01:27:44,374 --> 01:27:48,085
I can feel him.

779
01:28:00,832 --> 01:28:02,086
Danny.

780
01:28:02,790 --> 01:28:03,914
Danny.

781
01:28:09,045 --> 01:28:09,935
Did we win?

782
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:16,670
I'm gonna say yes.

783
01:28:17,584 --> 01:28:20,023
Hell... yes.

784
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:25,968
<i>My name is Johnny Blaze.</i>

785
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:30,236
I AM THE GHOST RIDER.
