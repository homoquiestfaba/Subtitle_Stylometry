1
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,470
<i>As the 21 st century began...</i>

2
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:48,104
<i>human evolution was</i>
<i>at a turning point.</i>

3
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:53,151
<i>Natural selection, the process by which</i>
<i>the strongest, the smartest...</i>

4
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:56,814
<i>the fastest reproduced</i>
<i>in greater numbers than the rest...</i>

5
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:00,757
<i>a process which had once</i>
<i>favored the noblest traits of man...</i>

6
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,260
<i>now began to favor</i>
<i>different traits.</i>

7
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,263
<i>TheJoey Buttafuoco case...</i>

8
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:09,165
<i>Most science fiction of the day</i>
<i>predicted a future that was more civilized...</i>

9
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,362
<i>and more intelligent.</i>

10
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:15,498
<i>But as time went on, things seemed</i>
<i>to be heading in the opposite direction.</i>

11
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,576
<i>A dumbing down.</i>

12
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,702
<i>How did this happen?</i>

13
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:23,078
<i>Evolution does not necessarily</i>
<i>reward intelligence.</i>

14
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,708
<i>With no natural predators</i>
<i>to thin the herd...</i>

15
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:29,118
<i>it began to simply reward those</i>
<i>who reproduced the most...</i>

16
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:33,352
<i>and left the intelligent</i>
<i>to become an endangered species.</i>

17
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:38,987
Having kids is such
an important decision.

18
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,532
We're just waiting
for the right time.

19
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,965
It's not something you want
to rush into, obviously.

20
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,969
No way.

21
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,471
<i>Oh, shit,</i>
<i>I'm pregnant again!</i>

22
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,668
Shit!
I got too many damn kids!

23
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,008
- I thought you was on the pill or some shit!
- Hell, no!

24
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,082
Shit! I must've been
thinkin' of Brittany.

25
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,309
Brittany?
No, you didn't!

26
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,478
- There's no way we could have a child now.
- Mm-mm.

27
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,556
Not with the market
the way it is, no.

28
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,988
God, no. That just
wouldn't make any sense.

29
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:09,027
Come on over here, bitch!
He don't care about you!

30
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,791
Yeah? Well, there must be
somethin' he likes over here.

31
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:15,163
- She don't mean nothin' to me, baby!
- Clevon!

32
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:18,328
Oh, shit.
It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

33
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,737
Well, we finally decided
to have children...

34
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:25,868
and I'm not pointing fingers,
but it's not going well.

35
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,879
And this is helping.

36
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,075
I'm just saying that before I have in vitro,
maybe you should be willing to...

37
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,084
It's always me, right?

38
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:36,553
Well, it's not
my sperm count.

39
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,216
Yeah! Yeah!
I'm gonna fuck all y'all!

40
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,088
That's my boy!

41
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,492
Whoo! Whoo!

42
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,298
Clevon is lucky
to be alive.

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,732
He attempted to jump
a Jet Ski from a lake...

44
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,067
into a swimming pool
and impaled his crotch on an iron gate.

45
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,232
But thanks to recent advances
in stem cell research...

46
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,310
and the fine work of Doctors Krinski
and Altschuler...

47
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,606
Clevon should regain
full reproductive function.

48
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,613
Get your hands
off my junk!

49
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,947
Unfortunately, Trevor passed away
from a heart attack...

50
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,149
while masturbating...

51
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:15,352
to produce sperm
for artificial insemination.

52
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,361
But I have
some eggs frozen...

53
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:21,160
so just as soon as the right guy
comes along, you know...

55
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,896
<i>And so it went for generations...</i>

56
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,805
<i>although few, if any,</i>
<i>seemed to notice.</i>

57
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,678
<i>But in the year 2005, in a military base</i>
<i>just outside of Washington, D. C...</i>

58
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:40,719
<i>a simple army librarian</i>
<i>was unknowingly...</i>

59
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,722
<i>about to change the entire course</i>
<i>ofhuman history.</i>

60
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,587
Come on, asshole!
Go on! Take him to jail!

61
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,490
Hey, Bauers.

62
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,090
This is Peterson,
your new replacement.

63
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:59,069
- My what? I'm gettin' replaced?
- Yeah, they didn't tell you?

64
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,265
- No.
- Some new assignment.

65
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,672
They're being all weird
and hush-hush about it.

66
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,609
I don't want a new assignment.
I tell Sergeant Metsler that every time.

67
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:10,479
- I'm good at this.
- Good at what? Sittin' on ass?

68
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,177
<i>No one ever comes in here.</i>

69
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,517
Yeah, I know. It's perfect for me.
No one bothers me. I can't screw up.

70
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,683
<i>If I can just stay in here another eight years,</i>
<i>I get my pension.</i>

71
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,920
I'm all set. Can you just
get me out of this?

72
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,759
No way. Not this time.
It's coming from high up.

73
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:30,234
Jesus. I don't understand.
Why me?

74
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,965
Every time Metsler says, "Lead, follow,
or get out of the way," I get out of the way.

75
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:37,702
When he says that, you're not supposed
to choose "get out of the way."

76
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,871
It's supposed to embarrass you
into leading or at least following.

77
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,846
That doesn't
embarrass me.

78
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,850
Look, Joe.
You don't have a choice.

79
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,783
You're just gonna
have to follow.

80
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,355
Like, follow me upstairs,
like, now.

81
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:54,222
Right now?
Shouldn't I train this guy?

82
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:58,525
I think he can figure out how to sit on his ass
and watch TV all day. Let's go.

83
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,665
<i>Gentlemen, meetJoe Bauers...</i>

84
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,903
our first subject for the Human
Hibernation Experiment.

85
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,945
Now, as you know,
throughout the years...

86
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,515
many of our best pilots,
soldiers and military leaders...

87
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,811
often go their entire careers
without ever seeing battle.

88
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:23,651
<i>With the Human Hibernation Project,</i>
<i>we will be able to save our best men...</i>

89
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,691
frozen in their prime,
for use when they are needed most.

90
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:30,524
<i>Joe, here, is not</i>
<i>one of our best men.</i>

91
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,260
Mr. Bauers was chosen primarily
for how remarkably average he is.

92
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:40,032
<i>Extremely average in every</i>
<i>category. Remarkable, truly.</i>

93
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,903
The most average person
in our entire armed forces.

94
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,534
Additionally, he has no family,
is unmarried...

95
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,943
is an only child,
and both parents are deceased...

96
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,710
making him an ideal candidate,
with no one to ask any nosy questions...

97
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,877
should something go wrong
with the experiment.

98
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:58,548
<i>We had a little less luck in finding a female</i>
<i>researcher's dream within our ranks...</i>

99
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:02,719
and were forced to look
into the private sector.

100
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,287
<i>This is Rita. Like Joe,</i>
<i>she has no immediate family.</i>

101
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,129
<i>Rita agreed to participate</i>
<i>in this experiment...</i>

102
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:13,296
in exchange for dropping
of certain criminal charges and a small fee.

103
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:17,103
<i>We did, however, have to come</i>
<i>to an arrangement with her pimp...</i>

104
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,237
<i>a gentleman who goes by the name</i>
<i>Upgrayedd, which he spells thusly...</i>

105
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:27,013
<i>With two D's, as he says,</i>
<i>for a double dose of this pimping.</i>

106
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,350
Upgrayedd agreed
to loan us Rita for exactly one year...

107
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,788
<i>and keep quiet on the matter,</i>
<i>in exchange for certain leeways...</i>

108
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,123
<i>with the local authorities</i>
<i>in running his pimp game.</i>

109
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,393
<i>First, however, there was</i>
<i>the difficult challenge of gaining his trust.</i>

110
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,329
<i>Collins, could we skip</i>
<i>to the technicals, please?</i>

111
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,735
Sure.
Let me just finish here.

112
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,139
You see, a pimp's love is very different
from that of a square.

113
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,269
Collins!

114
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,048
Fine. We'll move on.

115
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,948
It is a fascinating
world though.

116
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,956
Jesus, Collins.

117
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,361
Yeah, that's...

118
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,436
Anyway, the experiment
in which these two subjects...

119
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,534
are to be placed
into a dry freeze...

120
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,977
for exactly one year
is set to begin tomorrow.

121
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,275
As you know,
this is highly classified.

122
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:35,514
<i>However, if successful, we believe humans</i>
<i>can be stored indefinitely.</i>

123
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,753
So this is kinda crazy, huh?

124
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:49,392
- What unit are you with?
- Oh, I ain't in the service.

125
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,369
Oh, private sector.
Okay.

126
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,966
- So, uh, what do you do?
- A little of this, a little of that.

127
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,271
Wow, that's great.

128
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:02,211
You know, I really envy people
that can make a living that way...

129
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,340
<i>doing a little of this</i>
<i>and a little of that.</i>

130
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,251
I, uh, had a neighbor, Glen.
He used to make chainsaw sculptures...

131
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,255
and then he'd sell 'em
at the flea market.

132
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,257
Yeah.

133
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:18,129
So, uh, you an artist
or somethin'?

134
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,333
- Uh, yeah.
- You do paintings or...

135
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,903
- Yeah, paintings.
- Okay, great.

136
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,168
- Mm-hmm.
- What do you paint mostly?

137
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,338
I don't know, just...
people and fruit and shit.

138
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:40,613
Wow. Well, must be great to be able
to make a living doing something you love.

139
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,348
Yeah. It's not all it's cracked up to be.

140
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,117
- <i>Who wants to go first?</i>

141
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,715
Me.

142
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,765
- What the f... Oh, hell, no. Uh-uh.

143
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,565
Hey, no. You probably don't want to do that
with the I.V. s attached and all.

144
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,766
- What's the matter?
- Man, Upgrayedd didn't tell me
they'd be putting me...

145
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,968
in no damn coffin
with tubes and shit!

146
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:08,069
Oh, no, don't worry about it.
It'll be safe. Trust me.

147
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,738
Who's Upgrayedd?

148
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,817
He's my boyfriend.

149
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,120
Man, how do you know
this shit's safe?

150
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,121
These guys know what they're doing.
Don't worry.

151
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,987
They've tested it on dogs
and everything.

152
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,959
What happens is, the drugs will kick in,
we drift off to sleep...

153
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,053
we wake up in a year,
you'll be paintin' again.

154
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,155
- <i>It'll be fine.</i>
- All right.

155
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:31,168
Upgrayedd. That's an interesting name.
Is he Dutch?

156
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,838
See, 'cause I knew this,
uh, Dutch exchange student.

157
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,466
His name was Untgrad.

158
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,602
Okay, my niggas,
we're almost set here.

159
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,510
Just go ahead
and lie down. Relax.

161
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,588
See you in a year.

162
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,355
<i>The Human Hibernation Project...</i>

163
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:59,488
<i>was one of the army's most</i>
<i>ambitious experiments...</i>

164
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,432
<i>and one of its most secretive.</i>

165
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,969
<i>But it was not immune</i>
<i>from human error.</i>

166
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,707
Freeze!

168
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:22,082
<i>Soon after Collins's arrest</i>
<i>and the massive scandal that followed...</i>

169
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,952
<i>the base was closed.</i>

170
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:29,756
<i>It hadn't even been a year,</i>
<i>and the entire project was simply forgotten.</i>

171
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,897
<i>Things looked bleak forJoe,</i>
<i>but they were even worse for mankind.</i>

172
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,267
<i>As Joe and Rita lay dormant,</i>
<i>the years passed...</i>

173
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:43,399
<i>and mankind became stupider</i>
<i>at a frightening rate.</i>

174
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,884
<i>Some had high hopes</i>
<i>that genetic engineering...</i>

175
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,979
<i>would correct this</i>
<i>trend in evolution.</i>

176
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,253
<i>But sadly, the greatest minds</i>
<i>and resources...</i>

177
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,229
<i>were focused on conquering hair loss</i>
<i>and prolonging erections.</i>

179
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:14,239
<i>Meanwhile, the population exploded,</i>
<i>and intelligence continued to decline...</i>

180
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,936
<i>until humanity was incapable</i>
<i>of solving even its most basic problems.</i>

181
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:24,039
<i>Like garbage, which had been stacked</i>
<i>for centuries with no plan whatsoever...</i>

182
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:29,019
<i>leading to the Great Garbage</i>
<i>Avalanche of 2505...</i>

183
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:34,457
<i>which would set in motion the events</i>
<i>that would change the world forever.</i>

185
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,258
- Hold on.
- <i>Next, on The Violence Channel...</i>

186
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,593
an all-new <i>Ow! My Balls!</i>

188
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,946
- All right.

192
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,447
<i>That guy got hit in the balls.</i>

193
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,083
Ow, my balls!

195
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,965
Huh?

198
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,199
- <i>Where's...</i>
- Hold on. Shut up!

201
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,954
- Where's Officer Collins?
- Shut up!

202
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:16,687
<i>Next week on</i> Ow! My Balls!

- Are we on base?
- I'm gonna base your ass on my fist.

204
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,070
In your face, ass!
Shut up.

205
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,298
<i>I'm sorry. It's just...</i>
<i>Where am I?</i>

206
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,601
Shut up!
I told you already!

208
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,979
Yeah! Wouldn't shut up!

209
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,746
<i>Come in here</i>
<i>and not shut up.</i>

210
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:45,415
<i>Yeah, you were like,</i>
<i>"I'm not shuttin'up,"and I was like...</i>

211
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,006
<i>Unaware of what year it was...</i>

212
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,100
<i>Joe wandered the streets,</i>
<i>desperate for help.</i>

213
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,578
<i>But the English language</i>
<i>had deteriorated...</i>

214
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:13,778
<i>into a hybrid ofhillbilly, valley girl,</i>
<i>inner-city slang and various grunts.</i>

215
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:17,322
- <i>Joe was able to understand</i> them...

216
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,790
<i>but when he spoke</i>
<i>in an ordinary voice...</i>

217
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,487
<i>he sounded pompous</i>
<i>and faggy to them.</i>

218
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,079
<i>Paging Doc...</i>

219
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,620
<i>Report to, uh...</i>

<i>Your floor...</i>
<i>Your floor is now clean.</i>

225
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:08,466
Hi, uh, I was in an army experiment,
and I'm not feeling so well.

226
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,168
I think it might have been
the drugs they had me on.

227
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,404
I've been hallucinating.

228
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,980
<i>My head is just killin'me.</i>

229
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,107
<i>My-My-My joints</i>
<i>are all achy and l...</i>

230
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,753
<i>Is this a hospital or...</i>

231
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:26,985
- <i>Actually, I don't even know where I am.</i>

232
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,322
<i>Please proceed</i>
<i>to the diagnostic area on the right...</i>

233
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,762
- <i>and have a healthy day!</i>
- Oh. Thanks.

234
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,629
<i>Thank you!</i>

235
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:50,841
Uh, 'scuse me. I think this
might be Gatorade or somethin'.

236
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,851
- I was just looking for some regular water.
- Water?

237
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,979
- Yeah.
- You mean like in the toilet? What for?

238
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,990
You know, just to drink.

241
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,032
- <i>You've got hepatitis!</i>

242
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,899
<i>Oh, is someone not</i>

00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:27,218
This one goes in your ear.
And this one goes in your butt.

247
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,183
Come on.

248
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,191
- <i>Hurry up, asshole!</i>
- <i>Come on!</i>

249
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,225
- Shit. Hang on a second.

250
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,433
This one... No.

251
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,365
- Hey, come on.

00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,509
<i>Thank you for waiting.</i>
<i>Dr. Lexus will be with you shortly.</i>

255
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,856
<i>That's a weird misprint.</i>

256
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,063
Hey.
How's it hang, <i>ese?</i>

257
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,863
Yeah. Right.
Well, not so good, you know.

258
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,962
I don't really know what's going on,
but I'm seein' things.

259
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,974
I think it might be because of
these drugs the army put me on.

260
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:27,773
<i>But, if you could, uh, just get me</i>
<i>well enough to get back to base...</i>

261
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,542
Right. Kick ass.

262
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,777
<i>Well, don't wanna sound</i>
<i>like a dick or nothin'...</i>

263
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,719
but, uh, it says on your chart
that you're fucked up.

264
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:40,314
<i>You talk like a fag,</i>
<i>and your shit's all retarded.</i>

265
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:44,795
What I'd do is just like,
like, you know...

266
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,333
<i>like, you know what I mean? Like...</i>

267
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:52,700
- No, I'm serious here.
- Don't worry, scrot.

268
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,831
Now there are plenty of'tards
out there living really kick-ass lives.

<i>My first wife was 'tarded.</i>
<i>She's a pilot now.</i>

I need for you to be serious
for a second here, okay? I need help.

271
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,145
There's that fag talk
we talked about.

272
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,084
<i>All right, so that'll be...</i>
<i>this many dollars.</i>

273
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:13,249
<i>And if you could just go ahead and,</i>
<i>like, put your tattoo in that shit.</i>

274
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:17,294
That's weird. This thing has the same
misprint as that magazine.

275
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:21,457
- What are the odds of...
- Where's your tattoo? Tattoo?

276
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,331
<i>Why don't you have this?</i>

277
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,939
Oh, God.

278
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,101
- <i>Where's your tattoo?</i>
- Oh, my God.

279
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,681
<i>Why come you don't</i>
<i>have a tattoo?</i>

280

- You're unscannable.

283
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,225
- Unscannable!
- No! No, you don't understand!

284
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,890
<i>You gotta let me talk</i>
<i>to someone in the army! Wait a second.</i>

285

Everybody I know's dead!

286

Oh, my God! Oh!

288
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,902
- No! Stop! Calm down!
- Calm down! Calm down!

289
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,170

<i>The economy was</i>
<i>in a state of deep neglect.</i>

294

- Okay. This particular individual is unscannable.

320
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,298
Listen, I can explain, okay?
I was in an army experiment.

321

<i>Wait a second. There's the other pod</i>
<i>from the army experiment.</i>

<i>There was a girl.</i>
<i>She was from the same experiment.</i>

323
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,645
- Yeah, that's enough of your bullshit, sir.

324
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,773
<i>Joe was arrested for not</i>
<i>paying his hospital bill...</i>

329
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,131

- Why'd you do that?
- Yeah. I'm not guilty.

338
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,332
- That's not what the other lawyer said.
- What do you mean what the...

00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,405
Listen, you gotta get me
on the stand, okay?

340

I can explain everything. We can take 'em
to your house, show 'em the pod.

00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,872
<i>Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!</i>

342
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:29,413
<i>Now, prosecutor,</i>
<i>why you think he done it?</i>

343
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,540
Okay, number one, Your Honor,
just look at him.

345
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,179
- He talks like a fag too.

346
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,987
And "B," we've got all this,
like, evidence...

347
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:45,029
of how, like, this guy didn't
even pay at the hospital.

348
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,065
<i>And I heard that he doesn't</i>
<i>even have his tattoo.</i>

349
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,430
- I know!

350
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:54,062
And I'm all, "You've gotta be shittin' me."
But check this out, man.

351
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:57,073
Judge should be like, "Guilty."
Peace.

353
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,479
- Objection!
- What are you objectifyin' on?

354
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,848
- Come on. Just get me on the stand.
- Okay.

355
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,617
- Um, Your Honor?
- Hmm?

356
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,554
I object...

357
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:17,651
that this guy also broke
my apartment to shit.

358
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,754
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- What?

359
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:24,393
And you know what else? I object that
he's not gonna have any money to pay me...

360
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,631
<i>after he pays back all the money</i>
<i>he stole from the hospital!</i>

361
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,730
Don't say I stole.
You're my lawyer.

362
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,775
And I object.

363
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:35,745
<i>I object that he interrupted me</i>
<i>while I was watching</i> Ow! My Balls!

364
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:40,307
- That is not okay! And I rest my case!

365
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,819
Your Honor, I'm pretty sure
we have a mistrial here, sir.

366
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,288
- I'm gonna mistrial my foot up
your ass, you don't shut up.

367
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,859
- Please, listen.
- "Please, listen."

368
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,689
- I didn't steal anything.

369
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,696
I was part of an army
experiment...

370
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,790
<i>Joe stated his case logically and passionately...</i>

371
00:23:55,901 --> 00:24:00,998
<i>but his perceived effeminate voice</i>
<i>only drew big gales of stupid laughter.</i>

372
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,767
- Guilty!

373
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:07,504
<i>Without adequate legal representation,</i>
<i>Joe was given a stiff sentence.</i>

374
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:12,311
<i>Meanwhile, Rita had awakened</i>
<i>to find that the world's oldest profession...</i>

375
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:15,654

You have entered the name "Not Sure."
Is this correct, Not Sure?

00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,138
- No, it's not correct.

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,835
Thank you. "Not" is correct.
Is "Sure" correct?

403

Ow. Could I speak to your supervisor?

Oh, that's fuckin' great.

Okay, sir...

416
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:39,227
now we will begin to proceed
to obtain your I.Q. and "apitude" tests.

417
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,265
What for?

418
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:45,598
Okay, sir, this is to figure out
what your "aptude's" good at...

419
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:50,835
<i>and get you a jail job while</i>
<i>you're being a particular individual in jail.</i>

If you have one bucket that holds two gallons...

421
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,539
and another bucket
that holds five gallons...

422
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,412
how many buckets
do you have?

423
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,253
Two?

424
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,323
Thank you.

'Too.

<i>Desperate and scared...</i>

432
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:15,355
<i>Joe used his superior</i>
<i>intelligence...</i>

433
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,361
<i>to come up with the best</i>
<i>escape plan he could think of.</i>

434
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:24,095
Hi. Excuse me. I'm actually supposed
to be getting out of prison today, sir.

435
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,362
Yeah.

436
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:30,407
You're in the wrong line,
dumb ass. Over there.

437
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:33,807
I'm sorry. I am being
a big dumb ass. Sorry.

438
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,573
Hey, uh,
let this dumb ass through.

442
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,326
- 'Too.
- Yeah. Got it.

444
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:03,106
Uh, yeah, I don't see you in here.
So, you're gonna have to, uh, stay in prison.

445
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,108
Could you check again?

446
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,270
'Cause, I was, you know...
I was definitely in prison, okay?

447
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:12,315
I got sat on my face and everything.
Maybe check those files back there?

448
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:23,156
- <i>"Excape." "Excape."</i>

449
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,821
<i>"Excape." "Excape."</i>

450
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,696
<i>"Excape." "Excape."</i>

453
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,951
The Masturbation Network.

454
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:52,545
Keepin' America 'batin'
for 300 years.

455
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:55,353
- And now, <i>Sweet Bang Tube.</i>

456
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:00,227
- Oh, yeah, give me some. Cut me a piece.

457
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,322
- <i>Oh, yeah, that's...</i>

458
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,333
Go away! 'Batin'!

460
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,632
Damn it.

461
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,231
- All right.

462
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:16,179
Hey. Hey, get out of here.
Hey, get out of here!

463
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:20,377
No, wait, listen. You let me,
an innocent man, get thrown in jail.

464
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,852
So? Shut up,
'cause you broke my house.

465
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,890
Hey, I could have you disbarred...
disbarred... for what you did to me.

466
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,653
Then maybe <i>you'd</i> go to jail
for not havin' any money.

467
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,854
Oh, really?

468
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:35,262
Yeah, really. Now, look.
Okay, here's the deal.

469
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,357
I've been thinking.
It's been 500 years.

470
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:40,437
Someone has to have invented a way
to travel back in time by now.

471
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:43,439
You know, I think they were pretty close
even in my day. You know?

472
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,441
- With Einstein and guys like that?
- Uh-huh.

473
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,103
- You know, scientists? You know?
- Uh.

474
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,347
A time machine,
for time travel.

475
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:54,077
- <i>Do they have one?</i>
- What?

477
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:02,291
Jesus. I knew that was
too much to hope for.

478
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,521
No, no, they got
a time machine.

479
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,530
- They do?
- Yeah.

480
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,532
- Are-Are-Are you sure?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

481
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:13,468
- Can it get me back to 2005?
- Oh, yeah, but it's, like, really expensive.

482
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:16,802
And it breaks all the time 'cause
some smart guy made it a long time ago.

483
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:19,069
I don't care.
Just get me there, okay?

484
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,644
- Well...
- Please!

485
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:23,976
Listen, l... l...
I "supersize" with you...

486
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,846
<i>but didn't you go to jail</i>
<i>for not havin'enough money?</i>

487
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:31,081
Okay, how about this? You get me
to the time machine, and when I get back...

488
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,180
I open a savings account
in your name.

489
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,816
That way, 500 years later,
it'll be worth billions.

490
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,451
- <i>Billions!</i>
- 'Cause?

491
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,395
'Cause of the interest,
it'll be worth billions of dollars.

492
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:43,058
- Oh, l... I like money.
- Yeah.

493
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:46,159
- How many billions?
- Like, 10.

494
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,434
Yeah, suck one.
Time machine costs, like, 20.

495
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,338
Yeah? Okay.
Uh, 30, Frito.

496
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:55,606
<i>Thirty billion dollars.</i>

497
00:31:55,713 --> 00:32:00,150
Thirty billion.
So if you gave me 30 billion...

498
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,242
<i>and the time machine's 20...</i>

499
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,287
What's the minus
of 30 and 20?

500
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,119
Uh, it's, uh...
it's 80, Frito.

501
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,750
<i>It's $80 billion.</i>
<i>That's a mighty big minus, isn't it?</i>

502
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:13,592
- Yeah. I like money though.
- <i>Police! Open the door!</i>

503
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,859
- <i>We're looking for an "excaped"individual.</i>

504
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:19,562
- <i>This particular individual's name is Not Sure.</i>
- Eighty billion.

505
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:23,664
Oh, um, he...
He's... somewhere else.

506
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:28,109
- You got something I can wear?
- Yeah. There's Pro-Wear on the top,
assorted in the middle.

507
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:30,339
<i>A Coke machine in the vicinity caught his tattoo.</i>

508
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,212
<i>Seemed to be heading</i>
<i>for this particular "domistile."</i>

509
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,718
- <i>Okay, sir, we're comin'in.</i>

510
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,118
- No, you can't come in.
- <i>Can too!</i>

511
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,281
- Come on!
- All right, let's go get my billions.

513
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:46,654
Oh, okay, one more thing. We gotta go find
this girl, Rita, first, okay?

514
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,528
- Is she bangin'?
- Yeah, sure, she is.

515
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,534
That wasn't really
part of the deal.

516
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:55,538
- Okay, I'll, uh, throw in another
couple billion, all right?
- I like money.

517
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,700
Okay, her pod's up here on the right.
She shouldn't be far away, I hope.

518
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:03,577
<i>Mmm, girl. Oh, yeah?</i>
<i>So when we gonna do it?</i>

519
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:07,014
'Cause you been chargin' me by the hour,
and it's been, like, three days.

520
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:11,111
Oh, yeah. Soon, baby, soon.
Hey, you know what?

521
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:13,850
Why don't you
come back tomorrow?

522
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,586
- Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah!
- Yeah?

523
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,857
When I finally utilize you,
you gonna be paying me.

524
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:23,422
That's right.
Whatever you say, sir.

525
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,002
- Hey, you still on the clock!
- Yeah, girl.

526
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:29,232
- Thank you!
- Rita!

527
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,208
Rita! It's me, Joe, from the experiment.
Get in the car! Come on.

528
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,609
Oh, yeah!
What the hell, man?

529
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,613
Just get in the car.
I'll explain everything.

530
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,206
- Where we going?
- Just get in the car.

531
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,479
- Trust me.
- <i>What happened to those army guys?</i>

532
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,847
- Wait a minute. You got cops after you?

533
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:51,588
- Yeah.
- And you made me get in the car?
I got two strikes, asshole!

534
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,164
Frito, take a right here.
Right, right!

535
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,233
<i>Into that dust storm,</i>
<i>Frito.</i>

536
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,466
<i>They must have just forgotten about us.</i>

537
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:07,976
<i>It's been 500 years? Oh, hell, no!</i>

538
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,277
Upgrayedd is gonna kill me! He gets mad
when I'm a day late with his money!

539
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,476
So, you owe
your boyfriend money?

540
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,076
Well, yeah,
he's sort of my manager too.

541
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:20,988
<i>You know, he helps me sell</i>
<i>the paintings and shit.</i>

542
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:26,428
Look, Rita, you gotta understand that
Upgrayedd's been dead for a long time now.

543
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,329
- Yeah, man, but you said there
was a time machine, right?
- Yeah.

544
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:32,961
Yeah, there's a time machine
now that can take us back to the past...

545
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,471
but there was no
time machine back then, so...

546
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,508
Upgrayedd don't care where
the time machine is. Now, then, last week...

547
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,578
He will find a way
to come get his money!

548
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,773
- All I'm saying is you don't have to worry about it...
- You know what?

549
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,442
<i>Last time you told me not to worry</i>
<i>was 500 goddamn years ago...</i>

550
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,918
when you were trying to tell me
to get into some coffin.

551
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,012
- Look, Rita, I don't know
how this happened, okay?

552
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:55,422
But I'm doing everything I can
to get us back there, okay? I promise you.

553
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:59,087
<i>You are harboring</i>
<i>a fugitive by the name of Not Sure.</i>

554
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,826
Please, pull over and wait for the police
to incarcerate your passenger.

555
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,835
- Hell, no. You know what? Let me outta here.
- <i>Thank you for your help.</i>

556
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,167
If you don't have one of these,
they're gonna throw you in jail.

557
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,264
You don't want to get thrown in the jails here.
I've been in them.

558
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,105
They're bad. You're better off being with us,
as bad as that sounds.

559
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:18,205
- What are you doing? Why are we slowing down?
- Turned off my battery.

560
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:26,111
Look, how far is it?
Can we just take a cab or something?

562
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,223
Oh, shit.

564
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,798
Oh! Oh, shit!

565
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,136
- Yeah!

566
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:47,541
<i>What the hell's wrong</i>
<i>with you? That's your car.</i>

567
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:52,477
<i>Oh, hell, yeah! He's on fire!</i>

568
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,380
Come on!
Let's get out of here.

569
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,852
<i>Hey, how much farther is it?</i>

570
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,998
Uh, it's, like, far.

571
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:13,537
Man, I could really
go for a Starbucks, you know?

572
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:17,199
Yeah, well, I really don't think we have time
for a hand job, Joe.

574
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,972
<i>Man, he don't seem too bright.</i>
<i>You sure he knows where he's going?</i>

575
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,278
I sure hope so.
He's our only chance.

576
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,913
- How'd you hook up with this guy, anyway?

577
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:36,289
He's my lawyer.
And he's not a very good one either.

578
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,954
<i>He's a goddamned idiot.</i>

579
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:43,864
There's a shuttle down in the Costco.
It'll drop us right by the time machine.

580
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:05,850
Jesus Christ.
Oh, look. One more thing.

581
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:09,358
He thinks he's gonna get billions of dollars
if he takes us there.

582
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,590
So if he mentions anything about
a savings account, just play along, okay?

583
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,598
Yeah, what if this
time machine don't work?

584
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,999
Then I'll spend
the rest of my life trying to fix it.

585
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:29,303
Welcome to Costco. I love you.
Welcome to Costco. I love you.

586
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,780
Welcome to Costco.
I love you.

588
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,685
Shuttle's down there in electronics,
about an hour from here.

589
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,963
We've been walking forever.
You sure you know where you're going?

590
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:52,558
Yeah, I know this place pretty good.
I went to law school here.

591
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,604
In Costco?

592
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,105
<i>Yeah. I couldn't</i>
<i>believe it myself.</i>

593
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:00,871
<i>Luckily, my dad was an alumnus</i>
<i>and pulled some strings.</i>

594
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,111
<i>Hey, come on, Joe.</i>
<i>I already told you...</i>

595
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:08,310
<i>we'd all like a hand job,</i>
<i>but we don't have time for it.</i>

596
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,962
<i>Hey, baby, wanna go out?</i>

597
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,624
<i>Wanna go out, honey?</i>

598
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,968
Shuttle comes every few minutes.
Shouldn't be long.

599
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:35,807
- Do I got time to use the bathroom?

601
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:40,711
- <i>Uh, the toilet.</i>
- Be right back.

602
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,087
Yeah,
back that thing up.

603
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,486
- Hey, you mind if I pound on that, Joe?
- What?

604
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,421
- I like having sex with chicks.
- Yeah?

605
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:50,426
- Yeah.
- I think everybody does, Frito.

606
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:53,895
Not like I do. Like when you
get it like this, sideways.

607
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,523
Then you just, like,
back it up. And then you...

608
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,829
- <i>That's real good.</i>
- <i>Then you... Oh, yeah!</i>

609
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:01,029
Stop! You're gonna
get us caught, okay?

610
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,038
- <i>Warning! Warning!</i>

611
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,665
<i>Costco has detected a dangerous</i>
<i>fugitive in aisle 16,702.</i>

612
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:08,210
Hey! What about Rita?
We can't just leave her here.

613
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,542
I don't care.
Come on!

614
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:15,017
- Oh, shit. Wait a second. What are we gonna do?

615
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,053
Wait, okay, I know.
Here's what we do.

616
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:19,918
We go to the time machine,
then when I get back to the past...

617
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,958
I tell her not
to do the experiment.

618
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,254
- Then she won't even be here. That'll work, right?
- Uh...

619
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,330
- No, wait.
<i>Please stand clear of the doors.</i>

620
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,228
She already is here. That must mean
I didn't go back in time, right?

621
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,530
- Uh...
- No, wait, hold on. It just
means I haven't done it yet.

622
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:35,434
Okay, so I go back and I tell
her not to do the experiment.

623
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,099
Then I won't have to do it either
because she won't be here.

624
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,609
- Then I won't have to
come back and save her, right?
- l...

625
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,373
- But then, wait. Why am I still here?
- Uh...

626
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,449
Goddamn, how does
this time travel work?

627
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:49,417
- <i>Please stand clear.</i>
- Freeze! Hands up! Don't move!

628
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,216
- Put your hands up!
- Don't move! Freeze!

629
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:05,426
Look, if you guys are
taking me back to that jail...

630
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:08,266
<i>just go ahead and shoot me,</i>
<i>'cause there's no way...</i>

631
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:11,637
Ow! Fuck! Ow! Ow!

632
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:16,236
- What?
- Ow! Ow. Ow. Ow.

634
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,612
- <i>Ow! God! Hey, stop!</i>
- Damn it.

635
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:26,250
- <i>What is this?</i>
- <i>Okay, sir, this is the White House.</i>

636
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,655
- <i>What are we doing at the White House?</i>
- <i>What?</i>

637
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,057
- <i>Ow! Ow! Goddamn!</i>

638
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:34,620
<i>It turned out the results</i>
<i>ofJoe's I.Q. test...</i>

639
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:38,828
<i>had caught the attention</i>
<i>of the highest levels of government.</i>

640
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:43,100
Okay, wait a minute. I'm the smartest guy
in the world? Says who?

641
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,300
The I.Q. test you
took in prison.

642
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:48,173
You got the highest score in history.
Brought to you by Carl's Jr.

643
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,180
<i>Yeah, dumb ass, you're even smarter</i>
<i>than President Camacho.</i>

644
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,046
That's how come he's making
you secretary of interior.

645
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:56,119
Okay, so who are you?

646
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,949
I'm the secretary of energy.

647
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,717
He won a contest.
Got to be a cabinet member.

648
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:04,625
I'm the secretary of state.
Brought to you by Carl's Jr.

649
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:07,993
- Why do you keep saying that?
- 'Cause they pay me every time I do.

650
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:11,966
It's a really good way to make money.
You're so smart, why don't you know that?

652
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:16,297
- He's the secretary of defense.
- Hi.

653
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,376
And, uh, funbags over there
is the attorney general.

654
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,809
Hi.

655
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,073
And that's
the secretary of education.

656
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,517
<i>He's kinda stupid, but he's</i>
<i>President Camacho's stepbrother.</i>

657
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,850
<i>Still, he does</i>
<i>a pretty good job, eh?</i>

658
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:35,517
You know, I think there's been
some kind of mistake...

659
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:39,084
'cause the test I took
was real, real easy.

660
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:43,189
I'm not the smartest guy
in the world. Okay?

661
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:51,464
Okay, even if that were true,
I can't be the secretary of the interior.

662
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:55,033
- I don't even know what it is.
- <i>You better find out.</i>

663
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:58,012
- Sit down. It's President Camacho.
- Hey, hey, hey, yo...

664
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:02,074
<i>I gotta take care of some "bidness,"baby,</i>
<i>so I need y'all to wait outside.</i>

- So you smart, huh?
- No, no.

669
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:24,034
- I thought your head would be bigger.

670
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,138
Goddamn.

671
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,612
- It look like a peanut.

672
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,649

Shut up.

- Shut up. Sit your monkey ass down.

679
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,608
Chill out.

680
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:13,288
Shit.

681
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,756
<i>I know shit's bad right now</i>
<i>with all that starvin'bullshit.</i>

682
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:20,598
And the dust storms. And we runnin'
out of French fries and burrito coverings.

683
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,431
And the dust storms. And we runnin'
out of French fries and burrito coverings.

684
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,161
Yeah!

685
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,170
- But I got a solution.
- That's what you said last time, dipshit!

686
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,172
<i>I got a solution.</i>
<i>You're a dick!</i>

687
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,868
- South Carolina, "whassup?"

688
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:43,548
That's what I thought!

689
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:49,622
Now, I understand everyone's
shit's emotional right now...

690
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,252
but listen up.

691
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:55,127
I got a three-point plan
to fix everything.

692
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:56,722
<i>Break it down, Camacho!</i>

693
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:02,033
Number one,
we got this guy, Not Sure.

694
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:06,974
- <i>Number two, he's got a higher</i>
<i>I.Q. than any man alive.</i>

695
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:11,377
- <i>And number three, he's gonna fix everything.</i>

696
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,713
<i>I give you my word</i>
<i>as president.</i>

697
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,343
He'll fix the problems
with all the dead crops.

698
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,854
He's gonna
make 'em grow again.

699
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:24,917
- Crops?
- <i>And that ain't all. I give you my word.</i>

701
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,057
He's gonna fix
the dust storms too.

702
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:34,396
I give you my word.

703
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:38,032
He's gonna
fix the "ecomony."

705
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,908
And he's so smart...

706
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:48,212
- he's gonna do it all in one week.

707
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:51,879
<i>President Camacho stood before</i>
<i>the world and promised everyone...</i>

708
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:55,584
<i>thatJoe would solve</i>
<i>all their problems.</i>

709
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:59,857
<i>He would not only end the dust bow!</i>
<i>and heal the economy...</i>

710
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:02,591
<i>but he would cure acne</i>
<i>and carsickness as well.</i>

711
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,964
<i>And ifhe didn't...</i>

712
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:07,560
<i>President Camacho</i>
<i>made another promise.</i>

713
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:11,300
<i>He would kick Joe's smart balls</i>
<i>all the way up to the roof ofhis smart mouth.</i>

714
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:15,572
- <i>And then, he would throw</i>
<i>his brainy ass back in jail.</i>

715
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:22,178
I should, uh, be honest
with you, Mr. President.

716
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,413
I don't know how to be
secretary of anything.

717
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:25,988
I mean, I've never
even voted, actually.

718
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,888
I don't know what the secretary
of the interior even is.

719
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:33,656
Come on, scrot. Don't be a pussy.
It beats jail, don't it?

720
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:38,098
Besides,
you do a kick-ass job...

721
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:40,432
you get a full
presidential pardon.

722
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:42,437
- No jail time.
- Yeah?

723
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:46,168
Fuck, yeah!
Now gimme a beer.

724
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:48,335
<i>And get you one too.</i>

726
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:56,243
Shit!

727
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,821
Hold on, <i>vato!</i>

728
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,651
- <i>Whoo!</i>

730
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:23,372
- Do somethin' smart.
- Yeah.

731
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:28,377
Uh, okay.
Uh...

732
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:31,545
- <i>I'll, uh...</i>

733
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:35,216
- Hey, we found that lawyer you wanted.
- Oh, okay. Great, thanks.

734
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:40,319
<i>Uh, right now, I'm going to, uh, you know,</i>
<i>confer with my counsel.</i>

735
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,295
<i>You understand?</i>
<i>So I'll be right back.</i>

736
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:45,766
Gotta go, uh, work on some crop stuff,
get that taken care of.

737
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:50,533
- Hopefully get it worked out
by the time we get back here.
- Sounds pretty smart.

738
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,609
Wait here, okay?
Wait there.

739
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:55,542
Dude, this is trepidatious.
You got me a room at the White House.

740
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,614
Everyone gets laid at the White House.
Everyone.

741
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:59,341
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

742
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:02,885
I'm real glad you're happy to be here, Frito,
but I brought you here to help me.

743
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,648
<i>I don't know the first thing</i>
<i>about growin'crops...</i>

744
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,986
much less
the goddamn "ecomony."

745
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:10,025
Econ-Economy.

746
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:13,062
Let's see.
Growin' crops...

747
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,826
No, I just need you to tell me
how to get to the time machine.

748
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:21,098
Oh, that's easy.
You go down by the museum and stuff.

749
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:23,230
It's, like...
It's, like, by the museum...

750
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,934
sort of, but, well,
actually, not really.

751
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:30,571
More like... But on the street. You go, um...
Wait. Let me start over.

752
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,546
Okay, you know
where the time machine is?

753
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:35,618
Hey. Just draw me
a map, okay?

754
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,347
You still want the money?

755
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:41,288
Oh. If I had some money
and a room at the White House...

756
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:46,294
- I would be like, "It's mine, all night!"
- Listen. Cut it out!

757
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:49,194
Listen, I told these people
that you were smart, okay?

758
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,529
- So act smart!
- Smart like you?

759
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:55,127
<i>"Oh, I gotta go</i>
<i>to the time machine. I wanna go home. "

760
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:58,037
- I don't talk like that.
- "I don't talk like that."

761
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,075
Shit, I thought
there was two of you.

762
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:01,974
See?

763
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,639
<i>Doesn't look that big, is it?</i>

764
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:07,876
Okay. Let's go take a look
at those crops.

765
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:11,978
Especially the ones, uh, you know,
out around the museum area.

766
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,286
All right?
Hey, come on!

767
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:22,790
Now, you either lead, follow,
or get out of the way. All right?

768
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,233
Whoa.
Did you just make that up?

769
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:29,271
Yes, I did.
Now look...

770
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,967
I also need help finding this girl named Rita,
like, immediately...

771
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,475
- and Frito will give you a hand with it.
- Why?

772
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:41,344
Well, because, uh, you know,
she'd be an essential... integral... asset...

773
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:46,252
<i>you know, for our team,</i>
<i>for us to, you know, utilize.</i>

775
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:55,797
Utilize her!
Utilize her!

776
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:57,992
<i>Utilize!</i>

777
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:01,161
- Hey, uh, but you're gonna bring her here, right?

778
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,967
Oh, yeah.
Butt first!

780
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,812
- <i>Utilize her!</i>
- Okay.

781
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:17,818
Dang! May I approach
your benches?

782
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:26,055
Uh, yeah.
This sucks pretty bad.

783
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:28,996
<i>Frito, why don't you come over here and,</i>
<i>uh, take a look at this?</i>

784
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,535
<i>Come on. Hustle over here, buddy.</i>
<i>I wanna figure this out.</i>

785
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:36,436
See, uh, just not a lot of moisture.
Have you got the map?

786
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,508
- Oh, yeah.
- Discreetly.

787
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:45,610
- It's right there.
- I see it. I see it.

788
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:48,276
<i>Stand up with me.</i>

789
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:52,253
Yo, Mr. Secretary Not Sure.
They found that whore you wanted.

790
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:55,348
Hey, that may be how you refer
to women in the future, but come on.

791
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:59,725
No, sir. Turns out she charged some guy
a lotta money and didn't put out.

792
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,821
<i>Don't worry though.</i>
<i>We'll get her out...</i>

793
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:05,231
on a work-release whorin' license
as long as you're doin' her.

794
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,532
Get your hands off me. What do you think
I'm gonna do, run through the field?

795
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:10,970
What the fuck
are you all starin' at?

796
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:13,099
- Joe?
- That's Not Sure, ma'am.

797
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:17,112
- Secretary Not Sure.
- Secretary? Secretary of what?

798
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:21,810
Say, would you guys mind if we had
a little moment together? Alone?

799
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:26,321
<i>You know,</i>
<i>in the bushes?</i>

800
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,992
Oh, man.

802
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:42,129
- Fuck her, Joe!
- Hey, you want us to come along,
make sure she puts out?

803
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:44,264
No, thanks.
I can handle it. Yeah.

804
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,605
I thought you was in jail.
How'd you get to be the secretary of interior?

805
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,009
Just keep walking.
I'll explain everything.

806
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,757
Okay.
Get ready to run.

807
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,854
- <i>What?</i>
- Oh, goddamn it.

808
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:08,760
Way to go, Frito. You know what?
Just make a run for it anyways.

809
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:10,799
We'll ask for directions
on the way.

810
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:14,064
No way. I spent the last two days
looking for it. It ain't easy to find.

811
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:17,140
Damn it. I can't go back to jail,
and I sure can't solve these problems.

812
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,368
All's I know is I better find Upgrayedd
before he finds me.

813
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:23,844
Listen to me. Upgrayedd
cannot find you, okay? It's impossible!

814
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:26,677
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah! And even if Upgrayedd...

815
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:28,774
could somehow magically
travel through time...

816
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:32,321
we got secret service guys with huge guns
protecting us, okay?

817
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,322
So don't worry.
You're safe.

818
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:37,587
And you know what? It's none of my business,
but when we get back...

819
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:40,322
you and Upgrayedd should seriously think
about couples counseling, okay?

820
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,867
And you should also think about maybe finding
an art manager who's not also your boyfriend.

821
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:49,064
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>She's not puttin'out?</i>

822
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:53,302
Uh, no, she is.
We, uh... We already did it.

823
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,901
<i>Yeah. He was great.</i>

824
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:01,778
Okay. Hey, a couple of us guys
were wonderin', uh...

825
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:03,853
if we'd go family-style
on her.

826
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,847
Uh, yeah,
probably not right now.

827
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,418
<i>We should focus on the crops.</i>
<i>So let's get back to work. Maybe later.</i>

828
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:22,232
What the hell is this?

829
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:29,010
- Tastes like Gatorade.
- <i>Is that that Brawndo stuff?</i>

830
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:32,843
<i>They're watering crops</i>
<i>with a sports drink?</i>

831
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,248
<i>Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator</i>
<i>had come to replace water...</i>

832
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:39,515
<i>virtually everywhere.</i>

833
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:41,818
<i>Water, the basic component</i>
<i>of all life...</i>

834
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,917
<i>had been deemed a threat</i>
<i>to Brawndo's profit margin.</i>

835
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:48,520
<i>The solution came during</i>
<i>the budget crisis of 2330...</i>

836
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:53,467
<i>when the Brawndo Corporation</i>
<i>simply bought the F.D. A...</i>

837
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,037
<i>and the F.C. C...</i>

838
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:57,368
<i>enabling them to say,</i>
<i>do and sell...</i>

839
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:59,374
<i>anything they wanted.</i>

840
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:07,042
<i>Joe didn't know</i>
<i>any of this...</i>

841
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:11,143
<i>but he did see a problem</i>
<i>that he might actually be able to solve.</i>

842
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:15,816
- <i>With his options running out,</i>
<i>Joe took a bold step.</i>

843
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,053
<i>He would not</i>
<i>get out of the way.</i>

844
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:21,028
<i>This time, he would lead.</i>

845
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,156
For the last time,
I'm pretty sure...

846
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:26,235
what's killing the crops
is this Brawndo stuff.

847
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,100
But Brawndo's got what plants crave.
It's got electrolytes.

848
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,265
<i>So wait a minute.</i>
<i>What you're saying...</i>

849
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:35,174
is that you want us
to put water on the crops.

850
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:38,304
- Yes.
- Water. Like out the toilet?

851
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:42,408
Well, I mean, it doesn't have to be
out of the toilet, but, yeah, that's the idea.

852
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:45,852
- But Brawndo's got what plants crave.
- It's got electrolytes.

853
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:47,924
Okay, look.

854
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:51,516
The plants aren't growing, so I'm pretty sure
that the Brawndo's not working.

855
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:56,292
Now, I'm no botanist, but I do know
that if you put water on plants, they grow.

856
00:53:56,399 --> 00:54:00,096
Well, I've never seen no plants
grow out of no toilet.

857
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:03,468
Hey, that's good. You sure you ain't
the smartest guy in the world?

858
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:07,532
- You wanna solve this problem.
I wanna get my pardon.

859
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:11,603
So why don't we just try it, okay,
and not worry about what plants crave?

860
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:14,183
Brawndo's got
what plants crave.

861
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:16,809
- Goddamn it.
- Yeah, it's got electrolytes.

862
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,354
What are electrolytes?
Do you even know?

863
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:22,220
It's what they use
to make Brawndo.

864
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:24,953
Yeah, but why do they
use them to make Brawndo?

865
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:27,621
'Cause Brawndo's
got electrolytes.

866
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:35,071
<i>After several hours,</i>
<i>Joe finally gave up on logic and reason...</i>

867
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:38,231
<i>and simply told the cabinet</i>
<i>that he could talk to plants...</i>

868
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:40,969
<i>and that they wanted water.</i>

869
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:44,410
<i>He made believers</i>
<i>out of everyone.</i>

870
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:48,075
<i>Joe didn't know it,</i>
<i>but the beloved electrolytes...</i>

871
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:52,143
<i>were salts that had been</i>
<i>building up in the topsoil over the decades...</i>

872
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:54,985
<i>killing plants</i>
<i>and leading to the dust bowl.</i>

873
00:54:55,091 --> 00:55:00,825
<i>As secretary of the interior,</i>
<i>Joe ordered all crops to be switched to water...</i>

874
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:06,061
<i>promising that, over time, plants would grow</i>
<i>and the dust bowl would end.</i>

875
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:10,196
<i>He was on the fast track</i>
<i>to a full presidential pardon.</i>

876
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:13,435
- <i>Or so it seemed.</i>

877
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:18,446
Man, I hope somethin'
grows fast.

878
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,539
Yeah. So we can haul
our ass back home.

879
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:24,245
Man. You really think those people
would have starved to death?

880
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:30,419
I don't know. I mean, how did the world
ever get like this?

881
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:34,395
You know things are bad
when they're comin' to me for answers.

882
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,261
- It's a weird feeling being smarter than everyone.
- Mm-hmm.

883
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,597
- I'm not used to it.
- Yeah. Me neither.

884
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:46,070
You think Einstein walked around thinkin'
everyone was a bunch of dumb shits?

885
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,736
Yeah.
Hadn't thought of that.

886
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:52,975
- Now you know why he built that bomb.
- Yeah.

887
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:57,580
Hey, Joe, listen.
Those cops...

888
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,951
- Oh, hey. I'm sorry about that.
- <i>No. No.</i>

889
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:03,082
They said that
you got me a pardon.

890
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:06,219
You know, if you hadn't done that,
I'd still be in jail right now, so...

891
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,158
I guess I owe you one.

892
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,930
You know, you don't have to sleep
on the floor if you don't want to.

893
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:21,504
Oh. No. I'm...
I'm all right. Yeah.

894
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:25,672
Besides, you know, I don't think Upgrayedd
would be too happy about that.

895
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,443
You in bed with a stranger.

896
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:31,449
- Yeah.

898
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:36,188
I know. I know.

900
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:43,288
<i>Yeah. Oh, boy.</i>

901
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,801
Oh, shit.
It's Upgrayedd.

902
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,344
<i>Oh, shit. It's not Upgrayedd.</i>

903
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:58,744
<i>Given enough time,</i>
<i>Joe's plan might have worked.</i>

904
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:01,180
<i>But when the Brawndo stock</i>
<i>suddenly dropped to zero...</i>

905
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:03,718
<i>leaving half the population</i>
<i>unemployed...</i>

906
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,517
<i>dumb, angry mobs took to the streets,</i>
<i>rioting and looting...</i>

907
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:09,558
<i>and screaming</i>
<i>forJoe's head.</i>

908
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:12,355
<i>An emergency cabinet meeting</i>
<i>was called...</i>

909
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:14,794
<i>with the C.E.O.</i>
<i>of the Brawndo Corporation.</i>

910
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:17,366
How come nobody's buying
Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator?

911
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:19,833
Aw, shit. Half the country
works for Brawndo.

912
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,700
<i>Not anymore!</i>
<i>The stock has dropped to zero...</i>

913
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,967
<i>and the computer did</i>
<i>that auto-layoff thing to everybody.</i>

914
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:27,634
- We're all unemployed!
- You think that makes the "ecomony" suck?

915
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:31,805
- Why is this happening?
- I think it's because we switched to water, but...

916
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:34,406
- You mean this is all your fault?
- What?

917
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:38,351
Yeah, this is your fault. This shit started
happening when we switched to water!

918
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:42,357
Brought to you by Carl's Jr. Brought to you
by Carl's Jr. Brought to you by Carl's Jr.

919
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:46,891
<i>Fox News.</i>

920
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,193
He tried taking water
from toilets...

921
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:57,239
but it's Secretary Not Sure
who finds himself in the toilet now.

922
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,240
And as history
pulls down its pants...

923
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:02,607
and prepares to lower its ass
on Not Sure's head...

924
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:06,705
it will be DaddyJustice
who will be crapping on him this time.

925
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:11,014
We now go live to Violence Channel
correspondent Formica Davis...

926
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,988
at the Extreme Court
with highlights on today's trial.

927
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:21,692
Thank you, Velveeta.
Well, it started off boring and slow...

928
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:25,359
with Not Sure trying to bullshit everyone
with a bunch of smart talk.

929
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:29,564
<i>Blah, blah, blah. You gotta believe me!</i>

930
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,663
<i>That part of the trial sucked.</i>

931
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:34,436
<i>But then, the chief"J"</i>
<i>just went off.</i>

932
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,569
<i>He said, "Man, whatever.</i>

933
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:39,273
<i>The guy's guilty as shit.</i>
<i>We all know that. "

934
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:43,148
<i>And he sentenced his ass</i>
<i>to one night of</i> Rehabilitation.

935
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:45,813
Hey, rehabilitation?
One night?

936
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:47,822
Doesn't sound so bad.

937
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:49,789
Not so bad, huh?

938
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:53,158
Here's some highlights
from last week's <i>Rehabilitation.</i>

941
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,234
<i>And who could forget that wonderful finish...</i>

942
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:09,834
<i>by Rehab Officer Tylenol Jones?</i>

943
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:13,643
And tomorrow night looks even more better.

944
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:18,153
Word is that Beef Supreme himself
might come out of retirement.

945
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:20,950
Wow. Thank you, Formica.

946
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:25,417
So you think you can escape again
like you did last time?

947
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:28,326
- No. They pretty much fixed that.
- How?

948
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:30,695
They chained me
to a big rock.

949
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:34,001
- <i>Oh.</i>
- Yeah.

950
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:36,298
Look, Rita, get Frito.

951
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:39,534
Get him to take you back to the time machine
without me. Don't wait.

952
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:43,669
No. You could have split on me before,
but you didn't.

953
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:47,181
Look, you wanna pay me back?
Just go back, okay?

954
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:49,843
Tell people to read books.

955
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:52,046
Tell people to stay in school,
you know.

956
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:55,682
Tell people to just
use their brains or something.

957
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:58,989
<i>I think maybe the world got like this</i>
<i>because of people like me.</i>

958
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:03,691
I never did anything with my life.
At least you were an artist, you know?

959
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,360
- <i>So just go back and...</i>
- <i>Visit's over!</i>

960
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:12,797
And Rita, whatever you do,
keep painting, okay?

961
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:16,312
Good luck, Joe.

963
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:26,386
<i>Okay, that's five down and one more to go.</i>

964
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:30,186
<i>Are you ready for a monster-truck duel</i>
<i>to the death?</i>

965
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,820
<i>Yeah! Let's give it up</i>
<i>for the Guitar Army.</i>

967
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:37,900
<i>Okay, we're gonna do this shit.</i>

968
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:41,164
<i>But first, to lead us</i>
<i>in our Natural Anthem...</i>

969
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:46,037
<i>the star of</i> Ow! My Balls!
<i>Hormel Chavez!</i>

970
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:49,077
Thank you. Thank you.

972
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:57,844
- Come here!

973
01:00:57,954 --> 01:00:59,854
- <i>Right in the balls!</i>

974
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:04,757
- That's just how that shit went on TV!

975
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:09,093
This execution is brought to you
by Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator.

976
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:11,098
- <i>After you've killed someone...</i>

977
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,134
- <i>your body needs electrolytes.</i>
- Yeah.

978
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:16,535
So, my car's out front...

979
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,903
whenever you want me
to take you...

980
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,238
to the time machine.

981
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,278
Thanks, Frito.

982
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:25,472
- Yeah.
- <i>I can't hear you!</i>

983
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:28,778
That's a real bummer
aboutJoe, huh?

984
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:31,479
- <i>I can't hear you!</i>
- Yeah.

985
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:37,048
<i>Oh! Can you turn this up?</i>
<i>I love</i> Rehabilitation.

986
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:53,031
<i>Okay. Let's meet</i>
<i>our rehabilitation officers for tonight.</i>

987
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:56,441
<i>With a combined record</i>
<i>of 62 kills...</i>

988
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:01,381
<i>please welcome Vinny Mawumba</i>
<i>in the Dildozer!</i>

989
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:12,958
<i>And his brother Bobby Mawumba</i>
<i>in the Ass Blaster!</i>

990
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:15,030
I get a truck too, right?

991
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:17,861
Yeah.
Here it comes.

994
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,478
Get in.

995
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,349
You still got
the chain attached.

996
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:41,114
- <i>Door won't shut.</i>
- What about the chain?

997
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:43,192
- We could break it.
- No. He could escape.

998
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:46,853
- I got an idea. Let's put it in the trunk.
- Yeah. That'll work.

999
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:53,994
- <i>Who's smart now?</i>
- <i>Let's bring out our criminal.</i>

1000
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,231
<i>He tried to ruin the country</i>
<i>by pouring toilet water on crops.</i>

1001
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,740
<i>He cost millions of people</i>
<i>their jobs.</i>

1002
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:03,175
<i>Let's get ready</i>
<i>to rehabilitate Not Sure!</i>

1004
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:17,557
Never would have guessed
this is how I was gonna die.

1005
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:20,561
<i>Are you ready for some car-on-car action?</i>

1006
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,631
Yes.

1007
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:26,566
- I can't watch this.
- This is...

1008
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:31,163
<i>This is gonna be so sad.</i>
<i>I hope I don't cry.</i>

1009
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:36,877
Holy shit!
Frito, come here! Look!

1010
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:39,447
He was right.
The water... it worked.

1011
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:42,177
Frito, can you
get me over there?

1012
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:45,052
Yes.

1013
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:48,146
No, you fuckin' moron.
To the <i>Rehabilitation</i> place.

1014
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:50,282
- Uh, this way.
- Yeah!

1015
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:56,764
Come on, Frito.
Hurry!

1016
01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:59,892
<i>And now the dude that</i>
<i>everybody came here to see...</i>

1017
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:03,597
- Yeah!
- <i>the only undefeated officer ever in history...</i>

1018
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:07,233
<i>coming out of retirement</i>
<i>just to pound Not Sure's ass...</i>

1019
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:12,303
<i>driving the biggest, hugest correctional</i>
<i>vehicle ever built in history...</i>

1020
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:16,283
<i>bigger than the Dildozer,</i>
<i>bigger than the Ass Blaster...</i>

1021
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:20,412
<i>bigger and huger than everything</i>
<i>ever before in history...</i>

1022
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:23,458
<i>the brand-new Assdozer!</i>

1023
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:26,255
- <i>Give it up for Beef Supreme!</i>

1024
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:31,732
Oh!

1025
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,674
Oh!

1026
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:57,321
<i>Oh, shit. I think it was too big, huh?</i>

1027
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,917
<i>We seem to be</i>
<i>"experimenting"...</i>

1028
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:03,328
<i>some "techmological"</i>
<i>differences...</i>

1029
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:05,332
<i>so, uh, shit.</i>

1030
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:08,801
Frito, look!

1031
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,100
- It's working everywhere!
- Huh.

1032
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:15,268
<i>Well, shit. That's a big pile of rocks.</i>

1033
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:18,506
- <i>Kinda reminds me of this one time that I was...</i>
- Man.

1034
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:20,639
- Hey!
- <i>Oh, oh, okay.</i>

1035
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,945
- Get this shit started!
- <i>We're gonna start without Beef Supreme.</i>

1036
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:26,783
<i>Let the rehabilitation begin!</i>

1037
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:38,892
- Oh, shit.

1038
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:41,902
- Come on. Come on.

1039
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:44,472
<i>Come on, Frito. Hurry!</i>

1040
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,805
- Oh!

1041
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,041
Goddamn it.

1042
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:02,322
- Yeah!
- Jesus, that was close.

1043
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:07,728
Mr. President! Mr. President,
I need to talk to you.

1044
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:10,025
<i>You gotta stop this thing.</i>
<i>He was right about the water.</i>

1045
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:13,033
<i>We passed some crops</i>
<i>on the way here. They're growing.</i>

1046
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,035
I didn't see no crops.

1047
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:17,867
<i>They're circling around.</i>

1048
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,499
<i>They're gonna do</i>
<i>the Malachi Crunch on him!</i>

1049
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:26,546
- <i>This is an illegal move, okay? So don't tell nobody.</i>
- Oh!

1050
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:50,362
<i>So, uh... So the winner is, uh...</i>

1051
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:55,371
- <i>You gotta be shittin'me.</i>
- Did he win?

1052
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:00,442
Uh-oh. Look.

1053
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:06,049
<i>Holy shit! It's Beef Supreme!</i>

1055
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:15,159
<i>Beef Supreme! Yeah! Yeah!</i>

1056
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:19,530
Hey, Frito. Frito, you remember
those crops we saw off the road...

1057
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:22,263
- right by the Starbucks?
- Uh-huh.

1058
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:26,467
- Hey. Wanna make some money?
- I like money.

1059
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:44,989
Hey, um, the, uh... the main
screen is malfunctioning...

1060
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:47,619
and they gonna need you
outside immediately.

1061
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:53,859
There's a bunch of whores
in the hallway.

1062
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,530
Come on, Frito.
Hurry.

1063
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:02,702
Can't believe
you like money too.

1064
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:05,303
- We should hang out.
- Totally.

1065
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:32,664
<i>He's behind the truck!</i>

1066
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:37,541
- Yes! Yes!

1067
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:40,973
- He's behind the fucking truck!
- He's over there!

1068
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:43,142
<i>Behind the truck, stupid!</i>

1069
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,054
Look!

1070
01:08:57,266 --> 01:09:00,827
Shit.
That's a good deal.

1071
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:05,430
- <i>Extra foam.</i>
- I got a bunch of money too.

1072
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:08,169
- Forgot what it was for.
- Huh.

1073
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:13,245
- You think it was for lattes?
- Yeah. Probably.

1074
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:17,615
- <i>You like money and sex?</i>
<i>You're trippin'me out.</i>
- What the fuck?

1075
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:22,085
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1076
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:35,602
- Just hold on, okay?
Everyone just take it easy, okay?

1077
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:37,604
Can I just
say something here?

1078
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,944
I don't even know
what I'm guilty of here.

1079
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:46,947
I never said that I was the smartest person
on earth. You people did.

1080
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:50,712
I didn't know that you'd lose your jobs
and all your money...

1081
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:52,946
and I'm very sorry
that that happened.

1082
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:55,080
<i>But I'm tellin'you...</i>

1083
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,557
if you put water on the crops,
it might actually...

1084
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:00,652
No, it will work.
I promise you!

1085
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:05,166
<i>You just have to believe me.</i>
<i>I just wanted to help you. That's all.</i>

1086
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:10,102
<i>So you can try and shoot me.</i>
<i>You can try and run me over, whatever.</i>

1087
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:13,664
But I just want you to ask yourselves
one question first.

1088
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,402
Do you really want to live
in a world...

1089
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:21,005
where you try to blow up the one person
that's tryin' to help you?

1091
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,090
Hold on. Just hold on.

1093
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:57,679
Oh, man.
That was great.

1094
01:10:57,786 --> 01:11:01,449
Hey, was I wearing pants
when we went in there?

1095
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:04,958
Shit. What do I look like,
a pants goblin?

1096
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:08,393
Wait.
This reminds me of something.

1097
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:11,364
<i>Uh, "Rehabil... Rehabilate...</i>

1098
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:14,664
- Rehabilation."
- Why do you keep trying to read that word?

1099
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:18,297
- You a fag?
- I'll fag your face!

1100
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,975
- Come on, Frito.
- Yeah. I don't think so.

1101
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,821
Oh, yeah.

1102
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:19,791
This guy just got
his ass a pardon!

1104
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,573
Yeah!

1106
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:47,295
Man, Rita. I mean,
I don't know what to say.

1107
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:50,661
You saved my life.
No one's ever done anything like that for me.

1108
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:52,666
Yeah, well...

1109
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:55,794
you were looking out for the whole world so,
you know...

1110
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:59,601
- I thought someone should look out for you too.
- Thanks.

1111
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,576
I can't believe I'm even
saying this, but...

1112
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,670
<i>even though these people</i>
<i>tried to kill me...</i>

1113
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:09,239
- you know, I think I'm actually gonna
kinda miss 'em.
- Yeah.

1114
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:12,184
Frito... he's gonna give us
a ride back to the time machine.

1115
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:15,518
I just, uh...
I hope he's okay to drive.

1116
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:20,087
It's you. Oh, man,
I really love your show.

1117
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:22,493
Thank you so much.

1118
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:27,763
- <i>Uh, Joe, I'm not going.</i>
- What?

1119
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:33,439
I had some pretty bad habits back there
that I don't want to fall into again.

1120
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:35,510
Maybe it's time
I got a new start.

1121
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:39,741
<i>Besides, they offered me</i>
<i>a pretty good job at Starbucks here.</i>

1122
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:42,510
- I'm gonna be a C.E.O.
- At Starbucks?

1123
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:45,451
- Yeah.
- Yeah? You're still gonna paint though, right?

1124
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:50,523
Yeah. Sure.

1125
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:52,457
I guess this is
good-bye then.

1126
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:56,559
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey!</i>

1127
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:59,134
I got a couple
presidential decrees to make!

1128
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:00,829
I got a couple
presidential decrees to make!

1129
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:05,168
Not Sure, get your ass up here,
wherever you is.

1131
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:10,006
Let me get that little
peanut head up here.

1132
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:12,876
Yo. Yo.

1133
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:14,915
I have decided...

1134
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:17,542
to make this man...

1135
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:20,588
the man who solved
all our problems...

1136
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:24,586
<i>I have decided to make him...</i>

1137
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:26,991
my new vice president.

1139
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:32,762
Mr. President, thanks.
That's real cool of you, sir...

1140
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:36,736
- but I can't accept it, sir.
- What? Why?

1141
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:41,572
- You know, I gotta get home.
- But we still got all these problems.

1142
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:44,669
Look, you know, you're just gonna
have to solve 'em yourselves.

1143
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:47,248
- How?
- Think about it, you know?

1144
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:50,409
You're just gonna have to figure it out
like we did with the crops.

1145
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:55,047
<i>But how are we gonna figure out about</i>
<i>the garbage "ambulanches"and the "comony"?</i>

1146
01:14:55,157 --> 01:15:00,993
<i>And what about the nuc...</i>
<i>"nucular"reactor in Florida?</i>

1147
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:03,564
It's broke and leaky
and something's happening.

1148
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:09,035
- I thought it was in Georgia.
- Georgia's in Florida, dumb ass.

1149
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:12,197
Hey. Hey, I know.
Let's put toilet water on it. Huh?

1150
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:15,367
- Yeah!
- Good, good. That's a good idea.

1151
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:18,173
- <i>Like we did on the crops.</i>
- Come on, <i>vato.</i>

1152
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,578
Hey, you can't leave.

1153
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:26,621
Whatever happened to all that "lead, follow,
or get outta the way" shit, huh?

1154
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:41,802
I guess I just can't get outta the way anymore,
can I? You know what?

1155
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:44,805
- Forget about the time machine.
- Yeah!

1157
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:52,245
That ride sucks anyways.

1158
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:54,474
Ride?

1159
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,421
<i>Welcome to the Time Masheen.</i>

1160
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:05,016
<i>We are going to take you back,</i>
<i>first to the year 1939...</i>

1161
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:07,618
<i>when Charlie Chaplin</i>
<i>and his evil Nazi regime...</i>

1162
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:10,789
<i>enslaved Europe and tried</i>
<i>to take over the world.</i>

1163
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:13,493
<i>So you knew this thing</i>
<i>was just a ride the whole time?</i>

1164
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:17,094
Yeah. You thought you could really
travel through time, huh?

1165
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:19,571
- Yeah, I guess I did.
- Yeah.

1166
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:22,610
For the smartest guy in the world,
you're pretty dumb sometimes.

1167
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:27,614
- So why didn't you tell us?
- 'Cause I like money. I'm sorry.

1168
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:31,516
But if it's not a real time machine,
there wouldn't have been any money.

1169
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:35,112
You know, 'cause I can't go back in time
and open a savings account.

1170
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:38,158
Uh, uh, uh...

1171
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,024
Yeah. Don't worry about it.
It's okay.

1172
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:44,498
Well,
I guess we're stuck here.

1173
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:49,697
<i>But then an even</i>
<i>greater force emerged... the "UN."</i>

1174
01:16:49,805 --> 01:16:53,842
<i>And the "UN"</i>
<i>un-nazied the world forever.</i>

1175
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:54,103
<i>And the "UN"</i>
<i>un-nazied the world forever.</i>

1176
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:57,768
<i>And so, after serving a short</i>
<i>term as vice president...</i>

1177
01:16:57,879 --> 01:17:01,178
<i>Joe was elected</i>
<i>the president of America.</i>

1178
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,444
<i>Frito became vice president...</i>

1179
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:06,715
<i>and Rita, the former prostitute,</i>
<i>became first lady.</i>

1180
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:10,314
Today I step into the shoes
of a great man...

1181
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:14,555
a man by the name
of Dwayne Elizondo...

1182
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:18,656
Mountain Dew
Herbert Camacho.

1183
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:22,897
<i>Under President Not Sure's</i>
<i>leadership, a new era dawned.</i>

1184
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:26,839
You know, there was a time
in this country...

1185
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:31,208
when smart people
were considered cool.

1186
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:34,248
Well, maybe not cool,
but smart people did things...

1187
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:38,410
like build ships and pyramids,
and they even went to the moon.

1188
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,044
Yeah!

1189
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:46,388
And there was a time
in this country, a long time ago...

1190
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,895
when reading wasn't
just for fags...

1191
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:51,261
<i>and neither was writing.</i>

1192
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:55,462
<i>People wrote books and movies,</i>
<i>movies that had stories...</i>

1193
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:59,870
so you cared whose ass it was
and why it was farting.

1194
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:03,433
And I believe that time
can come again!

1196
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:18,952
Not Sure, Not Sure, Not Sure!

1197
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:24,766
<i>Joe and Rita had three children...</i>

1198
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:27,664
<i>the three smartest kids</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

1199
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:31,295
<i>Vice President Frito</i>
<i>took eight wives...</i>

1200
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:33,840
<i>and had a total of 32 kids...</i>

1201
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:37,173
<i>thirty-two of the dumbest kids</i>
<i>ever to walk the earth.</i>

1202
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:45,580
<i>Okay, so maybeJoe</i>
<i>didn't save mankind...</i>

1203
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:48,121
<i>but he got the ball rolling...</i>

1204
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:52,023
<i>and that's pretty good</i>
<i>for an average guy.</i>

1205
01:23:51,926 --> 01:23:54,622
I'm gonna go find this ho.
