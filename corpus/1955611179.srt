1
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:04,730
<i>Our village sat high in the
mountains of Southern Turkey.</i>

2
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,066
<i>It was half turk, half Armenian.</i>

3
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,769
<i>I was the local apothecary.</i>

4
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:14,106
<i>For 200 years
the boghosians made medicines</i>

5
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,608
<i>using formulas handed down
from our ancestors.</i>

6
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,544
All right.

7
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:21,847
<i>We treated everyone alike... Muslim
and Christian, rich and poor.</i>

8
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,215
Every morning and night.

9
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,584
<i>I was proud of our craft.</i>

10
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:29,688
<i>But making potions from herbs
and minerals was not enough.</i>

11
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,025
<i>My greatest desire
was to study medicine</i>

12
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:35,894
<i>at the imperial school
in constantinople.</i>

13
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:38,430
<i>- But I could never
afford the fees.</i>

14
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,368
<i>So I decided to
become engaged to maral</i>

15
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,205
<i>and use the dowry to pay my way.</i>

16
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:49,141
Here you are. Some tea.

17
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,143
Thank you.

18
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,914
Can I ask you a question?

19
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,983
Do you really want to do this?

20
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,921
We will build a future together,
maral and I.

21
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:06,258
And we will grow
to love each other.

22
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,794
And you will be proud of us.

23
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,505
Give this letter
to your uncle mesrob.

24
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,807
He is an important man
in constantinople,

25
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,077
but he has never
forgotten his roots.

26
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,979
He will take good care of you.

27
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,815
I will make you proud, papa.

28
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:36,288
The boghosians will bring
modern medicine into siroun.

29
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,658
Always remember, god has
given you this mission.

30
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,960
May he bless and protect you.

31
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,945
Oh, hey. What a day, huh?

32
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:03,448
The best wine, the finest food

33
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,951
and the perfect match.

34
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,953
Thank you for your
generosity, harut.

35
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,224
Karine, that's it. Thank you.

36
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,564
400 gold coins as agreed.

37
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:22,067
My daughter's future
and my trust in you.

38
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,037
Spend it wisely.
You won't regret it, sir.

39
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,181
Normally it takes three
years to become a doctor,

40
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,984
but I know that
I can complete it in two.

41
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,886
It will pass quickly, maral.

42
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,355
Not quickly enough.

43
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,994
I will pray for you every day.

44
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,397
Thank you.

45
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,372
Oh.

46
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,675
I'm going to the grand bazaar.

47
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,312
No, sorry. No, thank you.

48
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,928
Ah, my friend.

49
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,963
Better prices here. No, no, I...

50
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,932
Better prices here.
I'm going here.

51
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,934
This Armenian dog will rob you.

52
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:38,003
Get back to your thieves' den.

53
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,038
Always trying to
steal my customers.

54
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,708
Please. What can I
sell you today?

55
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,643
Are you Mr. mesrob boghosian?

56
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:47,179
Mesrob boghosian, yes.

57
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:50,115
What, is it a bill? No, no, no.

58
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,684
This is from my father
vartan boghosian.

59
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,619
I'm Michael.

60
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,288
You're vartan's son? Yes.

61
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,690
Why didn't you say so?

62
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,526
- Speak up! Come here!
- Hello, uncle.

63
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,062
Whoa. Whoa.

64
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,999
Good morning.

65
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,601
Thank you. Please.

66
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,739
Ah, here's my sweet yeva.

67
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,408
Ah. Oh!

68
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,910
Say hello to cousin Michael.
Hello.

69
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,545
- Hello, yeva.
- Please. Please.

70
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:26,518
Hmm. Oh, and here is
my beautiful wife Lena.

71
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,388
Michael boghosian,
cousin vartan's son.

72
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,189
Michael? Yes.

73
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,991
Welcome to our home. Thank you.

74
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,494
- And my Pearl, tamar.
- Hello.

75
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,396
Hello. Nice to meet you.

76
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,898
Oh, what a view.

77
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,069
There is Europe. There is Asia.

78
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,104
The world is at
your feet, Michael.

79
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,506
Do us proud.

80
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,946
How old is this suit, huh?

81
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:58,250
Come by my shop sometime. We need
to dress you like a doctor, huh?

82
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:05,056
Ah, that's the girls' tutor,
Ana khesarian.

83
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,359
The great violinist's daughter.

84
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:09,261
Just back from Paris.

85
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,770
Those are your notes?

86
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:53,305
Yes.

87
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,840
So you've already
studied medicine?

88
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,475
Yes. It's my passion.

89
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:59,010
Female anatomy.
That's my passion.

90
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:04,816
I have no interest in medicine. My father
gave me two choices. This or the military.

91
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,818
Emre ogan.

92
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,653
You? Michael boghosian.

93
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,761
Good morning, gentlemen.

94
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:19,498
Welcome to
the imperial medical school.

95
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,719
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

96
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,455
We haven't been introduced. I'm
Michael boghosian, mesrob's nephew.

97
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,557
Ana khesarian.
Lovely to meet you.

98
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,359
Lovely to meet you too.

99
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,896
Would you like some coffee?

100
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,699
- Please.
- Yes, thank you.

101
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:02,908
You're an artist.

102
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,709
Well, I try.

103
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,213
May I take a look? Please do.

104
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,553
These are excellent. Thank you.

105
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,391
So, mesrob tells me
you're from siroun.

106
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,561
Yes, I'm from siroun. My family
is from the village of ardoo.

107
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,196
Ah, ardoo. Yes, I've been there.

108
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,832
You have? Yes, yes, I'm
the local apothecary.

109
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,101
And now you're going to become a doctor.
That's wonderful.

110
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,537
Yes, yes, um, I will do that,

111
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,507
go back to the region
and set up a clinic there.

112
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,842
I intend to go back there
also, I think,

113
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,344
reconnect with my family.

114
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,446
Dance time.

115
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:44,916
Yes! We dance each
morning before class.

116
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,520
It releases the soul from here,
out to the extremities,

117
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:51,256
the hands, the brain, the feet.

118
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,259
It's both spiritual and medicinal.
Ah!

119
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,127
Why don't you join us?
No, no, no, no.

120
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,097
Come on, cousin Michael.
Dance with me.

121
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,033
It's wonderful! All right,
you want me to dance?

122
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:05,236
Let's go very, very slowly
for cousin Michael.

123
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:09,808
So, throw your arms up
to the wind.

124
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,977
Now dance through the forest.

125
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,912
Through the forest.

126
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,614
Through the fields of flowers.

127
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,916
Through the fields of flowers.

128
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:21,052
Now sweep them into your arms.

129
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,487
Arms.

130
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,623
And cast them to the heavens.

131
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,124
Exactly.

132
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,266
He's-he's very good. He's a
very good dancer. All right.

133
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:36,801
Good-bye. Bye!

134
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,304
It's medicinal.

135
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,976
The deceased died
from cancer of the bowel.

136
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,079
Monsieur boghosian,

137
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,981
please remove the spleen.

138
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,999
Very good.

139
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,272
Now, monsieur ogan,

140
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,708
can you please remove the
lesion on the small bowel?

141
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,179
- Lesion?
- The cancerous growth.

142
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,177
Hey.

143
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,745
Come on.

144
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:56,715
- It was shit.
- Well, what do you think is in a bowel?

145
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,400
Come with me.

146
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,335
Michael. Ana.

147
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,237
What a pleasant surprise.

148
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,907
Chris, Michael is the nephew
of monsieur boghosian.

149
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,511
- Uh, Christopher Myers.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

150
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,780
The legendary Chris Myers.

151
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,749
Emre ogan.

152
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:34,252
Notorious playboy.
Frequents opium dens.

153
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,055
How and why the hell
did they let you in here?

154
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,190
Good to see you.

155
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,927
May I introduce
mademoiselle Ana khesarian.

156
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,398
Constantinople is blessed by your
beauty, mademoiselle khesarian.

157
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,034
Nice to meet you.
Please join us.

158
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,336
Sir.

159
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:56,775
I'm so happy we get to meet when I'm
not teaching. Yes, what a surprise.

160
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,444
Chris is a star reporter
for the associated press.

161
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,480
We met in Paris when my
father was deputy consul.

162
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:05,416
- His father was a spy.
- Oh.

163
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:09,053
That's why you were a good drinking
companion. You were looking to expose us.

164
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:12,056
A toast. To old friends and new.

165
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,625
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

166
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,635
What brings you here, Chris?
Questions of war?

167
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,838
- The ap's star reporter comes east.
- The war has come east.

168
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,608
- This place is so boring.
- It<i> is</i> boring. I know the perfect place.

169
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,749
Absinthe makes
the heart grow fonder.

170
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,157
Oh!

171
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,200
No, no, no, no.

172
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,987
Bravo!

173
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,337
Dance with me. Please. Come on.

174
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,073
I don't know how to dance this.
I'll teach you.

175
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,852
Oh, no.

176
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,587
Poor Michael.

177
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,891
He needs help.

178
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,195
Let's swap.

179
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,497
Oh, hello.

180
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,599
Behave.

181
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,935
How are you? I think I
was being attacked.

182
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,937
I think you were too.

183
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,780
Bravo.

184
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,025
Oh, what a night, huh? Yes.

185
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:29,560
Sunday is my birthday.

186
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,130
My family are having a party
for me at ciragan palace.

187
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:35,600
You must join me and save me from
my father and his guests. Please.

188
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,636
Okay. Yeah.

189
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,705
Well, thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you.

190
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,607
Thank you. And thank you.

191
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,778
You make me feel like I'm home.
Thank you very much.

192
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,813
Thank you. Good night.
Good morning!

193
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,017
Michael!

194
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,287
You made it.

195
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,155
Happy birthday. Thank you.

196
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,593
You look absolutely amazing.
Oh, thank you.

197
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:38,629
Please join us.
That's my father.

198
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:42,000
He's a bigot. I'll spare you the
frosty introduction. Come with me.

199
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:46,337
Dear all, this is my friend
and mentor, Michael boghosian.

200
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,674
Nice to meet you. Ah, here's Ana.
Alone.

201
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:53,011
Chris seems to have abandoned me.
I'm sorry. Foolish man.

202
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,645
Some champagne? Water, please.

203
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,180
Hello, Ana. Hello, Michael.

204
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,149
Everyone, Ana khesarian. Hello.

205
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,951
Hello. Nice to meet you all.

206
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:02,120
Ah, I hear a French accent.

207
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:05,890
I lived in Paris for many years,
but I'm a proud Armenian.

208
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,964
This is a glorious day, general.

209
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,400
We have a flotilla waiting
to greet your ships.

210
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:18,202
Would you like to escape the
Germans for a little while?

211
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,507
Yes, I think I'd love that.
Let's take a walk.

212
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:26,911
I do sketches for some Parisian
magazines and American newspapers.

213
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,214
You're lucky to have
traveled the world.

214
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,585
<i>My mother died when I was 10.</i>

215
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:39,023
So after that, my father took
me all over Europe with him.

216
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:43,494
He played for the kaiser,
for queen Victoria.

217
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,563
Oh. He was wonderful.

218
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,168
And then, um...

219
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,172
And then he insisted I stayed
in Paris to attend la sorbonne.

220
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:55,740
And that's what I did.

221
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,409
But, um...

222
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,346
That was a terrible mistake.

223
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:03,848
Why?

224
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:07,919
Because he killed himself.

225
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,955
He was drowning in debt and...

226
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,392
And I had no idea.

227
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:17,795
If it wasn't for Chris,
I would have lost my mind.

228
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,531
I'm so sorry.

229
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,902
Oh, my god, what was that?

230
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,079
Chris!

231
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,081
Where were you?
We just took a walk.

232
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,383
Ah. You look beautiful.

233
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,119
Thank you. You see that?

234
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:44,388
Did you see? German...
German battleships.

235
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,791
Yes. A gift from
the turkish Navy.

236
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,327
Perfectly...
Perfectly innocent gift...

237
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,898
From teutonic... friends

238
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,633
to the turkish Navy.

239
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:00,004
Turkey has every right
to have a strong Navy.

240
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,340
The empire needs
to protect its borders.

241
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:05,176
The ottoman empire wants
its borders to stretch

242
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,145
from the Atlantic
to the Indian ocean,

243
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,013
and what these fellas...

244
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:13,417
These Germans want your sultan to declare
a holy war against the infidel...

245
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:17,121
The British,
the French and the Russian.

246
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:19,023
Hmm?

247
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,771
Curb your tone, Mr. Myers.
This is not Paris.

248
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:37,141
It's certainly not Paris. I apologize.
Yes, you do apologize.

249
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:40,344
Well, maybe Berlin. It's starting
to look a lot like Berlin.

250
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,780
Gentlemen, let us
celebrate this great day.

251
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,720
- Chris. You made your point.
- You've made your point.

252
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:53,858
Armenians aren't singing? Oh, that's right.
You're the resident infidel.

253
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,494
You'll be the first to go
when the war breaks out.

254
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:58,229
Chris, please. Ana!

255
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,674
<i>I let my anger
get the better of me.</i>

256
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:12,143
But the Germans, I can't
stand their arrogance.

257
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:13,511
<i>Their</i> arrogance?

258
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,913
You insulted me.
You insulted my friend.

259
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,416
I'm sick of
your drunken behavior.

260
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,985
I can't take it anymore.
I will stop drinking.

261
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:23,321
I-I've heard that before.

262
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,389
No, I swear. I swear.

263
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,727
Please sit down.

264
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,401
I'm sorry.

265
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,071
You wanted to come...

266
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,008
Find your roots and start over.

267
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,611
I understand. I support that.

268
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:50,214
I love what you're doing. I love your
illustrations. They compliment my work.

269
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,250
I love that we are partners.

270
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,589
We have something very special.

271
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,593
Don't give up on that.

272
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:41,299
Over there. Line up.
Line up over there.

273
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:44,302
Over there. This way.
Everyone must line up.

274
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:47,305
Hey, Armenian, gonna teach you
how to fight and die now.

275
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:52,009
Get in line. No exceptions.

276
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,679
Everyone line up. You!
Get in line!

277
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,482
- Next.
- Everyone in line!

278
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:06,157
Emre ogan. Sadly, I must accept
the medical student exemptions.

279
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,429
Next.

280
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,164
Hello. Good day.

281
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:20,504
- Boghosian from siroun?
- Yes. Yes.

282
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,311
You have been assigned
to the third military division.

283
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:31,048
- Uh, I am a medical student.
- So?

284
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,285
I would like to apply for
a medical student exemption.

285
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:36,854
You're not a turk. Armenians
have to apply in their hometown.

286
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,156
Um, I-i can't go
all the way back.

287
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,459
I'm sorry, I can't go... officer.

288
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,531
Mr. boghosian
is a medical student.

289
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:51,535
His loyal family are good friends
of my father ogan pasha.

290
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,537
He would appreciate a favor.

291
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,742
Of course.

292
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,614
Thank you.

293
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,684
Thank you.

294
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,319
Thank you, my friend.

295
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:11,088
You really thought I'd be
in line to join the army?

296
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,265
- Where are you going?
- There's something bad going on around konia.

297
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,833
I need to investigate.

298
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:26,404
And listen. It's very dangerous
for Armenians right now.

299
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,206
When I get back, I'll go
get you an American visa.

300
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,208
I wanna get you out of here. No.

301
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,911
What do you mean, no?

302
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:37,348
No. I'm not going to pack up and run
off at the first sign of trouble.

303
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,717
If it's not safe for me, then it's
not safe for any of my people.

304
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:41,552
Ana, this is different.
I'm staying.

305
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,888
Yes?

306
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,523
Yes.

307
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:48,058
Yes, I'll be there.
Yes, I'm coming right now.

308
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,960
I have to go.

309
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:52,096
- We'll discuss this when I get back.
- All right.

310
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,199
Ana, you, uh...

311
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,471
You be careful.

312
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,109
<i>You</i> be careful.

313
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,610
Yes.

314
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,425
Emre.

315
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:22,993
Come.

316
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,066
Father.

317
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:32,002
Dr. nazim. <i>Salaam alaikum.
Alaikum salaam.</i>

318
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,338
It has come to my attention
that you used my name

319
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,307
to procure an exemption
for an Armenian.

320
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:43,180
He's my friend, father,
entitled to an exemption.

321
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,982
I may... the Armenians

322
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,685
are a tumor in our midst, emre.

323
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:50,154
Do you understand?

324
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,090
Tumor, yes.

325
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,960
You took
this military exemption?

326
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:57,761
Yes, father.

327
00:24:57,763 --> 00:25:01,499
I need to learn how to identify
tumors so that I can best serve.

328
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,033
Don't you agree, doctor?

329
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:04,368
Hmm.

330
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,005
Good night.

331
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:17,715
Ana! Ana! Ana! Ana!

332
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:21,118
Ana! Ana! Ana! Ana!

333
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,455
Ana! Ana! Ana! Ana!

334
00:25:24,457 --> 00:25:27,892
Ana! Ana! Ana! Ana!

335
00:25:27,894 --> 00:25:29,860
Ana! Ana!

336
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,863
Ohh!

337
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,543
Thank you.

338
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,514
May I?

339
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:52,750
Y-you got chocolate
on your face.

340
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:55,052
Oh. Yes.

341
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,725
- Gone?
- Yes. -Thank you.

342
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:05,362
Um, I was wondering.

343
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:09,700
Uh, father komidas is singing
at the cathedral on Sunday.

344
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:13,437
He's a dear friend, and my father
accompanied him many times.

345
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,574
Would you like to come with me?

346
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,543
Yes.

347
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:22,012
Of course. I would love to.
Wonderful.

348
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,082
Thank you.

349
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,586
- Good night.
- Good night.

350
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,627
Ana is a fine woman, Michael.

351
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,198
Yes.

352
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,434
Yes, Chris is a very lucky man.

353
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:46,470
Mmm, Lena tells me
things are not so good

354
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:48,772
between her and the American.

355
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,741
You know, women talk.

356
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:53,110
It can't happen, uncle. Why not?

357
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,579
She's very fond of you.
It's obvious.

358
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:57,548
I'm betrothed
to a girl in siroun.

359
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,483
- You are betrothed?
- Yes.

360
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,620
Her name is maral.

361
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:09,326
We're using the money from the
dowry for my studies here.

362
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:11,662
Betrothal.

363
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:15,899
My father, your great-uncle,
was a cruel man.

364
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,235
He matched me with a witch.

365
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,471
She tormented me every day.

366
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:23,407
Barren as the desert.
Thank god she died.

367
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:27,511
Then I found Lena, a good
woman from our province.

368
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:29,613
How much is this dowry?

369
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:31,949
Four hundred gold coins.

370
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:33,884
I've used 100 already.

371
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,654
You'll give it back.

372
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:42,292
All 400, and 200 more
to ease their trouble.

373
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:45,529
Money is not a problem.
I will give you the money.

374
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,433
I made a promise.

375
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:54,371
I... can't go back
on that, uncle.

376
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:33,277
Hello!

377
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,884
We must leave, sir!

378
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:45,522
Hey!

379
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:48,959
We cannot be here.
We must leave. It's forbidden.

380
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,098
Wait!

381
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,499
Come.

382
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,635
We must leave. Come!

383
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,460
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Go over there.
Go over that way.

384
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:25,262
<i>Nein. Nein.</i> Go over that way.

385
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,864
Stop the car! We can't stop!

386
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:29,767
Stop! Stop the car!
Stop the car! Get out!

387
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:32,202
No, this is my car!
I'll pay you more.

388
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:35,706
Here. Here, here. Here.
I'll come back. Get out.

389
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:38,008
That's my car! This is my car!

390
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,346
Get in! Get in!

391
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,424
- No!
- Wait!

392
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:16,526
Kill him! Kill him!

393
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,196
Please stop!

394
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:20,564
Please stop!

395
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,534
No! Stop!

396
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,871
Get away!

397
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,389
Stop!

398
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:47,524
Get in. Quick.

399
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,367
Give me a key.

400
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,904
Here. Room 12.

401
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:02,572
Take him up. Thank you.

402
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:05,409
I will send ointment, hot water.
Thank you.

403
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,717
They set fire to his shop.

404
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,488
My god.

405
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,736
Let me take a look at you.

406
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:50,020
Oh.

407
00:34:50,022 --> 00:34:51,855
I'm sorry.

408
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,262
Were you throwing cabbages?

409
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,933
And a couple of potatoes.

410
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,437
They can go make soup.

411
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,300
I'm sorry.

412
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,435
Where are you going?

413
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:22,539
I need to go back to the hotel.

414
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:25,775
Well, y-you can't go alone.
It's not safe.

415
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:29,212
No, no. No, I better go alone.

416
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:31,414
I need to sort things
out with Chris.

417
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,260
I'm coming with you.

418
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,364
A young child tried to
pull her to her feet,

419
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:50,200
and as she lay on that dirt road,
a turkish cavalryman rode up

420
00:37:50,202 --> 00:37:51,835
and dispatched her...

421
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,604
With a single shot.

422
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,640
Write it. Write it.

423
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:58,942
Good morning.

424
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:01,111
Here you are, miss khesarian.
Thank you.

425
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,147
Hold for more.

426
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:07,217
- Oh, my god.
- What?

427
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:09,319
It's from Lena. She's in trouble.
Where were you?

428
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,960
What are you doing here? Were you
with this bastard last night?

429
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,395
Please calm down. That's enough.

430
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:21,431
Listen to me.
Mesrob has been arrested.

431
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:24,067
Lena is alone with the girls.
We have to go right now.

432
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:26,836
- Mr. Myers, New York is waiting.
- Ana.

433
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,638
- We must go, Chris!
- Ana!

434
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,808
Mr. Myers, New York. We
will lose the connection.

435
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,414
Armenian men are being
slaughtered in their villages.

436
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:41,017
Their women and children are being
driven into the desert to be murdered!

437
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,218
Send that!

438
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,158
Lena? Lena?

439
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,426
Michael.

440
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:51,995
Michael?

441
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,633
What happened? Oh, Michael.

442
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:59,336
They've taken mesrob.
Who has taken him?

443
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:02,172
State security have taken
him to sikedji prison.

444
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,174
They said he's being
investigated for treason.

445
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:06,376
All right.

446
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:08,011
Wait here.

447
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,381
Is papa coming back?

448
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:13,049
Oh, yeva.

449
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,952
The men said
he's an Armenian traitor.

450
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:18,521
It's a mistake, yeva.
Your father is a good man.

451
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,799
I'll go speak with emre.
He'll help us get mesrob out.

452
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:32,736
I'll bring your<i> baba</i>
back home. Don't worry.

453
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,473
Michael.

454
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,826
Mesrob boghosian? Yes.

455
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,077
This is good.

456
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,445
All right.

457
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,958
Father komidas.

458
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,004
You come with me. I need you
to point out your uncle.

459
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,440
You can wait here.

460
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:09,666
Him. That's my uncle.

461
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,044
What? What?

462
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,580
What's happening, please?

463
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:26,282
Sir, I have an exemption.

464
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,384
Emre.

465
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,163
I warned you. You will
join the army today.

466
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,465
The captain will escort
you to your barracks.

467
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:46,336
I do not want to lay eyes on you until
you restore honor to the family name.

468
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,676
Sir. Sir, please.
I have an exemption.

469
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:12,529
Involving the mass arrest of
intellectuals, bankers and clergy.

470
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,732
It does appear to be an attempt

471
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:18,902
to stifle and silence
the Armenian population.

472
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,641
Please come in. Yes.

473
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:27,577
Ambassador morgenthau, can I get
back to you when I have more news?

474
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:28,578
Please sit down.

475
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,213
Thank you.

476
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,250
Chris,
this is mesrob's wife Lena.

477
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:36,719
They have nowhere to go.

478
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,190
Come here with me.

479
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:43,860
Nice to meet you. I'm so sorry.

480
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:46,496
Please, have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.

481
00:42:46,498 --> 00:42:48,498
Thank you.

482
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,067
Let me get a cloth
for your face.

483
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,903
Will you excuse me.

484
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:35,705
Take his place.

485
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:41,678
Up!

486
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:03,966
Help me. Help me. Please.

487
00:45:03,968 --> 00:45:05,702
Don't let me die.

488
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,271
Come. Come.

489
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,052
You should thank me.

490
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:25,922
I eased your burden.

491
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,159
Thank me.

492
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,764
I said...

493
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:36,566
Thank me.

494
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,839
Thank you.

495
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,611
Thank you. Thank you.

496
00:45:48,613 --> 00:45:49,946
Thank you.

497
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,791
He's better off dead.

498
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:05,294
We'd all be better off dead.

499
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:09,565
We won't have long to wait.

500
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:13,436
Another month, winter will come and
we'll freeze in these mountains.

501
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,705
They need us for this railroad.

502
00:46:15,707 --> 00:46:17,440
No, they don't.

503
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:19,776
They're going to kill us.
I know.

504
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:21,944
- How do you know?
- Do you see that?

505
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,248
It's a bullet. It's still there.

506
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,650
Went in my cheek,
bounced up here.

507
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:35,458
I was in the battalion
building the drizi road.

508
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,294
And when we finished,
they brought in machine guns.

509
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:39,962
Blood everywhere.

510
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,933
A few of us survived,

511
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:46,669
spared to dump the bodies
into a ravine.

512
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,809
Let me see this.

513
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:02,919
If we find something sharp and
some thread, I can take this out.

514
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:05,688
No, no. It's my good luck.

515
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,491
You a doctor? Medical student.

516
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,570
I was a clown...

517
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,873
In the circus.

518
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:00,042
I used to make
the children laugh.

519
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,143
The dynamite is weeping.
Be careful.

520
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:38,481
Thank you.

521
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:46,355
Thank you.

522
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,358
- Shoot him!
- Thank you.

523
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:21,510
It's raining!

524
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:30,886
Water!

525
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:32,621
Water!

526
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:35,291
Water! Water!

527
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,443
Someone! Water!

528
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:59,548
Get us out of here!

529
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,217
Hello? Who is it?

530
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:02,885
Help us get out of here!

531
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:04,653
Hello! Yes! Open the doors.

532
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:07,623
- Save us! Help us!
- Please.

533
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:15,297
- I can't breathe!
- I beg you! I beg you!

534
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,251
Help us! Save us!

535
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:46,081
You're Armenian! I'm Armenian!

536
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:47,883
Please help me! Please!

537
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:49,218
Come. Come.

538
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,654
These are our sons.

539
00:54:51,656 --> 00:54:54,390
Did you see them? They were
conscripted in tarsus.

540
00:54:54,392 --> 00:54:56,158
No, I'm sorry.

541
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:59,295
Tarsus is close? Yes.

542
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:01,764
I-I am from siroun.
Do you know it?

543
00:55:01,766 --> 00:55:03,499
I know of it.

544
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,836
God bless you both.

545
00:56:12,236 --> 00:56:14,303
Food, please.

546
00:56:14,305 --> 00:56:17,206
Wake up! Wake up, you traitors!

547
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:19,608
Wake up, traitors!

548
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:24,813
Great news!

549
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:28,550
Our victorious army have driven
the British back into the sea.

550
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:32,388
And the Russian dogs
have fled for their lives.

551
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:37,760
Be ready, Armenians. We will
find you a new homeland.

552
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,840
Who are you?
We have nothing here.

553
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,576
Mama.

554
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,615
Oh, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.

555
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:05,387
Papa.

556
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:07,756
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you.

557
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,260
All the young men are gone.

558
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:15,264
Our business is gone.

559
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:20,002
We have nothing left.

560
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:25,007
Praise god, at
least we have you.

561
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:28,477
I ca...

562
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,949
I can't stay here.

563
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,685
They'll kill us all
if they find me.

564
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:40,556
Where will you go?

565
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:42,124
I don't know.

566
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:46,462
I don't know. Rest up, son.

567
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,134
Michael.

568
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,249
Oh!

569
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:11,453
I'm not a ghost.

570
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:14,923
Michael, thank god you're alive.

571
00:58:14,925 --> 00:58:18,594
Harut has the answer. As soon as
I told him, he had the answer.

572
00:58:18,596 --> 00:58:21,063
Get dressed and he will explain.
Come.

573
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,042
Is he well enough then?

574
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,715
Come. Sit down.

575
00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:42,951
Hello.

576
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,454
- Maral.
- Michael.

577
00:58:45,456 --> 00:58:47,856
Well, here's my plan.

578
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:50,225
I keep a cottage
for my woodcutters.

579
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:53,695
It's high in the hills. No one
ever goes there. You'll be safe.

580
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,731
We must hurry to make
all the arrangements.

581
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:58,166
Maral will prepare all the
provisions you will need.

582
00:58:58,168 --> 00:59:00,202
Vartan and I
will bring the priest.

583
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,672
The priest?

584
00:59:03,674 --> 00:59:07,643
Yes. Oh. We'll have to have the
wedding at the cottage tomorrow.

585
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:09,878
It is too dangerous for you
to go to the church.

586
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,714
Tonight you can leave
for the hills.

587
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:18,453
My prayers have been answered.

588
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,558
You'll sit out this war,
make babies.

589
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:27,396
Oh, praise god
you've been spared.

590
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:34,069
What's wrong?

591
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:40,909
In constantinople,
I fell in love with someone.

592
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:47,849
I can't do this.
I can't marry maral.

593
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:51,019
You have to marry maral.

594
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:54,423
Whatever happened,
that was another life.

595
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:57,893
You told me you would
grow to love maral,

596
00:59:57,895 --> 00:59:59,828
and you will, my son.

597
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,098
You will.

598
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:40,302
Ah. Here you are.

599
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:42,638
Please come in.

600
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:50,946
Everything you will need
for a quiet life.

601
01:00:50,948 --> 01:00:52,814
I will bring you supplies
each week.

602
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,818
Welcome.

603
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,520
Thank you.

604
01:00:58,522 --> 01:00:59,988
So peaceful. Thank you.

605
01:01:21,712 --> 01:01:25,013
<i>Tell me about constantinople.</i>

606
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:27,649
<i>Is it as magical as they say?</i>

607
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:30,352
There are churches
and mosques...

608
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,155
Like you couldn't believe.

609
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:37,292
The finest fashions
from Paris and London.

610
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:41,463
In the grand bazaar, you
could buy anything you want,

611
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:45,233
from a camel to a crown.

612
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,404
Were you happy there?

613
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,814
It... was a different life.

614
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,707
Can I help you?

615
01:02:25,709 --> 01:02:27,909
- Pastor merril?
- Yes, who are you?

616
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:29,711
I'm Christopher Myers
from the associated press.

617
01:02:29,713 --> 01:02:31,580
I have correspondence
from the us embassy

618
01:02:31,582 --> 01:02:33,915
and I have money
from the church relief fund.

619
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:36,718
God bless you.

620
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,687
You're heaven-sent.
God bless you.

621
01:02:38,689 --> 01:02:41,056
Hello. Welcome. Welcome.

622
01:02:41,058 --> 01:02:43,859
Dozens of orphans
are arriving every week.

623
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:46,695
Most have them have just seen their
parents murdered before their eyes.

624
01:02:46,697 --> 01:02:49,798
This whole country
is a graveyard.

625
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,367
There are bloated bodies
polluting the rivers.

626
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:54,803
Corpses rot in the desert.

627
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:57,439
I was told that you're organizing
an escape route for orphans.

628
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:02,277
Who told you that?
I want to go with them.

629
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:06,815
This is a stark endeavor. It needs
to be recorded for posterity.

630
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:17,092
A group of orphans left for the
port of bassek a few days ago.

631
01:03:17,094 --> 01:03:19,661
When the guides return, you can
leave with the next group.

632
01:03:19,663 --> 01:03:21,296
Thank you.

633
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:32,174
Lena won't come with us.

634
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,011
Why?

635
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,615
She won't leave without mesrob.

636
01:03:40,617 --> 01:03:44,319
She wants to stay in siroun
with Michael's family.

637
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:48,657
I want to take her there.

638
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:54,529
I need to go and talk to his family.
I really do.

639
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,735
Would you come with me?

640
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:05,340
Of course.

641
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:12,848
Thank you.

642
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:29,030
My eyes get worse, marta.

643
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,833
Nonsense.

644
01:04:31,835 --> 01:04:34,736
You see well enough
when you count your money.

645
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:36,705
We'll get you better glasses.

646
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:38,540
Who is it?

647
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:41,843
Who is it? Lena.

648
01:04:41,845 --> 01:04:43,879
Lena boghosian.

649
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:49,384
Lena. Come in.

650
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:50,852
Come in. Oh.

651
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:52,754
Oh, vartan. Lena.

652
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,124
Close the door.

653
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,527
This is your uncle vartan.

654
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:03,498
- Who are you?
- Oh, they are my friends. They saved us, thank god.

655
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,167
Mesrob has been deported
to chankiri.

656
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:08,103
They took our house, everything.

657
01:05:08,105 --> 01:05:09,938
And then they came and...

658
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:13,475
We are good friends of your son
Michael from constantinople.

659
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:15,777
Michael is dead.

660
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:21,950
- Oh.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

661
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:26,922
There are spies everywhere.

662
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:30,025
You're a foreigner. You'll
bring trouble down on us.

663
01:05:30,027 --> 01:05:32,394
- Marta, please.
- They have cared for us, marta.

664
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:34,162
No, no, it's okay.
We should leave.

665
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:40,869
H-he was a very good man.
I'm truly sorry.

666
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:43,305
Lena is with her family now.

667
01:05:43,307 --> 01:05:46,207
We will take care of her
and the girls.

668
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:48,143
Ana.

669
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,180
Ana.

670
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:57,385
- God bless you, Ana.
- Ana.

671
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:22,978
Are you all right?

672
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:31,219
I think I am with child.

673
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:37,692
Mmm. Oh.

674
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,341
Deputy governor.

675
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:56,311
Welcome.

676
01:06:56,313 --> 01:07:00,115
The order from Istanbul is
that no one's to be spared.

677
01:07:00,117 --> 01:07:02,217
You should evacuate the
orphans as soon as you can.

678
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:10,125
Who are you? I'm Christopher Myers.
I'm from the associated press.

679
01:07:10,127 --> 01:07:12,560
Ah, yes, Mr. Myers.

680
01:07:12,562 --> 01:07:16,131
I've been alerted that you're in my district
and you're to be detained and deported.

681
01:07:16,133 --> 01:07:18,366
I have all the official documents
from the sultan's office

682
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,068
and from the American embassy.

683
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:22,037
Mr. Myers.

684
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:23,605
I suggest you leave this place.

685
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:27,542
I've done all I can, pastor.

686
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:29,010
Please take my advice.

687
01:07:29,012 --> 01:07:30,092
Thank you, deputy governor.

688
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,549
I'm risking my life
being here, Mr. Myers.

689
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:36,918
I want your word
that you will not expose me.

690
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:41,189
You have my word. Absolutely.
I would never reveal a source.

691
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:43,558
You need to get those
children out of here, pastor.

692
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:57,739
Who is it? Mama, it's me.

693
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:00,742
Michael.

694
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:04,612
Why are you here? What's wrong?

695
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,016
She's sick.

696
01:08:08,018 --> 01:08:10,385
Let's get these wet clothes off.

697
01:08:10,387 --> 01:08:12,654
We must get her to bed. Come.

698
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:18,426
It's a very difficult pregnancy.

699
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:21,529
She needs better nourishment.

700
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:23,598
She needs calcium, iron.

701
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,767
Perhaps after she rests,
we can...

702
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:30,071
Michael?

703
01:08:30,073 --> 01:08:31,139
Lena?

704
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:35,376
Oh, my god. Lena?

705
01:08:35,378 --> 01:08:36,945
Oh...

706
01:08:38,648 --> 01:08:40,248
I... I thought...

707
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,283
Oh, oh, are-are the girls here?

708
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:43,718
Yes.

709
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,987
Yes? And mesrob?

710
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:50,458
They still have him.

711
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,894
Wha... how...
How did you get here?

712
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:55,997
Ana and Chris brought us.

713
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,400
Ana was here?

714
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:00,602
Yes.

715
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:02,170
I told them you were dead.

716
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,642
- Why?
- You trust no one.

717
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:14,182
- Where is Ana now?
- Michael, you have to leave before the sun comes up.

718
01:09:14,184 --> 01:09:16,417
They were at the American
mission at moodan.

719
01:09:16,419 --> 01:09:20,922
The missionaries there have an escape
route to get orphans out of the country.

720
01:09:20,924 --> 01:09:23,758
They're going with them soon.

721
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,995
Ana wanted us to go, but I won't
leave here without my mesrob.

722
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:28,496
Escape? How?

723
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:30,832
Well, by boat.
From bassek, I think.

724
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,635
Michael,

725
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:35,436
seeing you alive
has given me hope

726
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:37,038
that my mesrob
will also survive.

727
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,840
Yeva is restless.

728
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:55,523
I have to go. Michael.

729
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:58,526
I have to find them. Michael.

730
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:01,829
Leave these people alone.
You're safe in the woods.

731
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:04,199
No, no, I'm not safe.

732
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:07,235
No one here is safe.
Don't you see what's happening?

733
01:10:07,237 --> 01:10:10,038
We have lived through
these turkish threats before.

734
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,807
It's not... "threats"?
They want us dead.

735
01:10:12,809 --> 01:10:15,677
I have to get us out of here
before there's no time left.

736
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:18,046
Trust me. It's all right.

737
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:21,115
I'm getting us out of here.

738
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,234
When will you be back?

739
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:42,770
Soon.

740
01:10:42,772 --> 01:10:44,806
Soon? Very soon.

741
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:51,246
My parents will take care
of you till I come back.

742
01:10:58,520 --> 01:10:59,621
Don't worry.

743
01:10:59,623 --> 01:11:01,256
All right.

744
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:03,625
All right.

745
01:11:46,336 --> 01:11:47,502
Almost done.

746
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:49,971
Close your eyes.

747
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:53,508
One...

748
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,643
And two...

749
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:39,487
Ana.

750
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:56,931
Thank you.
I can't believe you're here.

751
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:09,243
Lena tells me that you
are headed for the sea,

752
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:11,078
that you have a way
out of the country.

753
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,113
Yes.

754
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:14,982
Ana, I need your help.

755
01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:16,451
My family...

756
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:19,987
In siroun,
I need to get them out.

757
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:23,224
Of course. Yes.

758
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:37,004
I have a wife.

759
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,177
When we met at constantinople,

760
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:48,015
I was already betrothed
to a girl in my village.

761
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:51,252
When I returned home,

762
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:53,821
we married.

763
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:04,699
I'm-I'm sorry, Ana.

764
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,167
Michael is alive.

765
01:15:40,169 --> 01:15:41,536
I saw.

766
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:43,671
He wants us to help his...

767
01:15:43,673 --> 01:15:45,640
His wife and his family escape.

768
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,112
We have to help them.

769
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:57,552
And after that, he'll be gone,
and we'll never see him again.

770
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:48,302
Here you go.

771
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:57,545
- Bye.
- Bye.

772
01:16:57,547 --> 01:17:01,048
Mr. Myers, when you arrive in
bassek, find reverend antreassian.

773
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:02,917
He'll arrange the boats for you,

774
01:17:02,919 --> 01:17:05,586
and tell him we'll be along with the
rest of the orphans as soon as we can.

775
01:17:05,588 --> 01:17:07,888
Thank you. You're a brave man.

776
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,290
Thank you.

777
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:11,792
God bless you.
And take care of them.

778
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:12,960
Hyah!

779
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:53,501
We're close to siroun.

780
01:17:53,503 --> 01:17:56,037
We'll find a place to rest
while I get my family.

781
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:11,018
Here you go.

782
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:13,220
Oh, my god, you're so heavy.

783
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:16,323
- May I have some bread?
- Oh, yes, me too.

784
01:18:16,325 --> 01:18:18,459
Thank you, Ana. Thank you, Ana.

785
01:18:28,705 --> 01:18:31,405
I'm guessing that your wife
knows nothing about Ana.

786
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:33,708
What?

787
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,311
How do you intend
to introduce them?

788
01:18:37,313 --> 01:18:39,346
Why?

789
01:18:39,348 --> 01:18:42,149
Are you going to report it?

790
01:18:42,151 --> 01:18:45,586
Is-is this what you do? You feed
off the pain and misery of others?

791
01:18:45,588 --> 01:18:47,755
Without reporters,

792
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:50,758
the Armenian people would
disappear, and no one would know.

793
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,828
How wonderful it must be

794
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:56,897
to go back to the comfort of your
American home and write about it.

795
01:19:00,837 --> 01:19:03,838
Huh? What was that?
What's going on?

796
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,407
Ana?

797
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,376
Mustafa, get the mules.

798
01:19:09,378 --> 01:19:11,679
- Ana, load them up. We should leave.
- Everybody, get up.

799
01:19:11,681 --> 01:19:13,347
Take my hand. Come on.

800
01:19:13,349 --> 01:19:15,549
Everybody in the carriage
right now. Quickly.

801
01:19:15,551 --> 01:19:18,452
Mira, help me, please.

802
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:45,980
That's our horse. Oh, god.

803
01:19:52,388 --> 01:19:53,554
Papa!

804
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:17,738
Papa.

805
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:10,724
No!

806
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:17,698
Michael.

807
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:22,836
Mama.

808
01:22:28,143 --> 01:22:29,276
Mama.

809
01:22:32,914 --> 01:22:35,182
Oh. Oh, thank god.

810
01:22:41,757 --> 01:22:42,957
Yeva?

811
01:23:03,112 --> 01:23:05,079
Run!

812
01:23:05,081 --> 01:23:06,280
Michael!

813
01:23:06,282 --> 01:23:07,948
Run!

814
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:09,149
All right.

815
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:13,821
Go!

816
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:22,029
Ana! Mustafa!

817
01:23:22,031 --> 01:23:23,831
Oh, my god!

818
01:23:27,102 --> 01:23:29,336
- We have to go now! Help!
- Ana!

819
01:23:31,607 --> 01:23:34,508
- I'm coming.
- Go! Go! We need to go!

820
01:23:42,318 --> 01:23:43,517
Chris!

821
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:45,119
Come back!

822
01:23:45,121 --> 01:23:46,520
Hyah!

823
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:03,537
There he goes! Turn around!

824
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:20,387
American! American reporter!

825
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:24,358
I have papers. Here. Get down.

826
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:25,960
I'm gonna get off
the horse. Don't shoot.

827
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:29,696
Here.

828
01:24:29,698 --> 01:24:33,567
Travel documents from the sultan's office.
Permission.

829
01:24:36,672 --> 01:24:38,072
Ah! Aaah!

830
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:06,033
Rrrr!

831
01:25:06,035 --> 01:25:09,470
Mama? Mama.

832
01:25:09,472 --> 01:25:10,904
Mama!

833
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:14,274
It's over. It's over. Ana...

834
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:16,143
Shh.

835
01:25:16,145 --> 01:25:17,611
All right?

836
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:19,379
Mama.

837
01:25:19,381 --> 01:25:21,648
Michael, tell me, please.
Where's Lena?

838
01:25:23,752 --> 01:25:25,219
They're all gone.

839
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:28,422
They killed them all.

840
01:25:57,285 --> 01:25:59,253
Mr. Myers.

841
01:25:59,255 --> 01:26:01,722
I am faruk pasha,
commander of this region.

842
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:07,427
What is the associated press
doing here, Mr. Myers?

843
01:26:07,429 --> 01:26:10,130
Uh, reporting on the...
On the war.

844
01:26:10,132 --> 01:26:12,299
There is no war here.

845
01:26:12,301 --> 01:26:15,035
Merely the evacuation of the civilian
population to a safer region.

846
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:18,005
Hmm.

847
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:23,710
"The gallant
Armenian partisans of Van"

848
01:26:23,712 --> 01:26:27,114
put up a heroic resistance
against turkish divisions,

849
01:26:27,116 --> 01:26:29,383
"inflicting heavy casualties."

850
01:26:29,385 --> 01:26:30,851
Hardly objective reporting.

851
01:26:31,886 --> 01:26:33,854
This is my favorite.

852
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:38,025
"A turkish official,"

853
01:26:38,027 --> 01:26:41,395
a man of unshakable humanity
and courage,

854
01:26:41,397 --> 01:26:44,565
informed us that faruk pasha...

855
01:26:44,567 --> 01:26:47,634
A general
notorious for barbarism...

856
01:26:47,636 --> 01:26:51,038
"Has been instructed by the highest
authorities to spare no village."

857
01:26:52,674 --> 01:26:54,374
Are these words
your fabrications,

858
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:57,544
or the words of
some lying turkish traitor?

859
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:02,649
Prove to me that you
did not fabricate these words.

860
01:27:05,753 --> 01:27:08,889
Give me the name of the
high-ranking turkish official.

861
01:27:08,891 --> 01:27:12,893
I'll confirm he gave you this
information and release you.

862
01:27:12,895 --> 01:27:14,094
Uh...

863
01:27:16,664 --> 01:27:17,831
No.

864
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:19,733
You are not a journalist.

865
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:23,437
You are a foreign agent.

866
01:27:23,439 --> 01:27:26,406
You insist there is war here?
Very well.

867
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:30,043
Under the military code of war,

868
01:27:30,045 --> 01:27:33,213
- I'm obliged to execute you!
- No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no!

869
01:27:33,215 --> 01:27:34,948
Don't! Don't! Don't!
To execute you...

870
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,990
Don't! Don't! As a foreign
agent and a collaborator!

871
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:40,821
Oh.

872
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:48,095
Now,

873
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:52,299
was that my barbarism...
Or mercy?

874
01:27:53,801 --> 01:27:55,035
Take him!

875
01:28:13,988 --> 01:28:15,188
Whoa.

876
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:23,497
- Who are you?
- We're fleeing siroun on the way to bassek.

877
01:28:23,499 --> 01:28:25,899
This is bassek.

878
01:28:25,901 --> 01:28:27,634
No one left in the village.

879
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:30,237
We were told to find
a reverend antreassian,

880
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:32,272
and he would arrange for a boat
for these orphans.

881
01:28:32,274 --> 01:28:35,742
There are no boats. The turks
have destroyed them all.

882
01:28:35,744 --> 01:28:39,446
- Who are you?
- I'm the mayor of bassek.

883
01:28:39,448 --> 01:28:42,416
The turks are on their way
to drive us into the desert.

884
01:28:42,418 --> 01:28:45,152
You'll find reverend antreassian
back there.

885
01:28:57,098 --> 01:28:59,266
Excuse me. Reverend antreassian?

886
01:28:59,268 --> 01:29:00,467
Back there.

887
01:29:00,469 --> 01:29:02,502
Reverend antreassian?

888
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:04,438
Hello. We are from the
American mission.

889
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,039
Hello. We were told to
meet you in bassek.

890
01:29:06,041 --> 01:29:08,809
Where are you going?
I don't know.

891
01:29:08,811 --> 01:29:12,813
Faruk pasha sent orders that we
were to be evacuated to aleppo.

892
01:29:12,815 --> 01:29:16,650
Mayor stepan announced that
we would not obey the turks.

893
01:29:16,652 --> 01:29:18,819
We have brought
the orphans with us.

894
01:29:18,821 --> 01:29:22,389
You need to come with us.
We will care for you.

895
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:30,030
Um, there's this American
reporter, Chris Myers.

896
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:32,132
Did he find you? No.

897
01:29:32,134 --> 01:29:34,468
No, I have not encountered
any Americans.

898
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:35,535
Oh.

899
01:29:37,638 --> 01:29:39,272
Thank you very much
for your help.

900
01:30:06,267 --> 01:30:08,368
Emre.

901
01:30:08,370 --> 01:30:10,103
Am I glad to see you.

902
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:15,675
You are in
very serious trouble, Chris.

903
01:30:15,677 --> 01:30:16,910
Mmm.

904
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:18,745
They're going to
make you disappear.

905
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:22,249
I need your help, emre.

906
01:30:22,251 --> 01:30:25,285
I need to get word to the American
ambassador. He can stop this.

907
01:30:26,888 --> 01:30:27,921
Help?

908
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:32,426
I'm in this ridiculous uniform
because I tried to help Michael.

909
01:30:34,128 --> 01:30:36,263
Now you're asking me
to commit an act of treason?

910
01:30:36,265 --> 01:30:38,532
I... listen, Chris.

911
01:30:40,067 --> 01:30:42,102
They're willing
to offer you a deal.

912
01:30:50,211 --> 01:30:51,645
You sign it,

913
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:54,948
you'll live, Chris.

914
01:30:57,318 --> 01:30:59,820
You'll go to jail, but your
government will get you out.

915
01:31:01,589 --> 01:31:03,757
The world knows
you're not a spy.

916
01:31:03,759 --> 01:31:05,892
If I sign this confession...

917
01:31:11,165 --> 01:31:14,768
It destroys everything
I've ever written,

918
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:16,603
my reputation, my future.

919
01:31:16,605 --> 01:31:17,637
Future?

920
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,173
What future?

921
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:25,645
Trust me, my friend. If you do not
sign this, your future ends tonight!

922
01:31:27,915 --> 01:31:31,117
No one knows you are here.

923
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:32,986
No one will know you died.

924
01:31:36,424 --> 01:31:37,591
You'll know.

925
01:31:41,429 --> 01:31:42,496
Hey.

926
01:32:05,453 --> 01:32:06,520
Listen to me.

927
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:11,491
The turks will come soon
to punish us.

928
01:32:11,493 --> 01:32:14,227
Join me and fight them,
or you should leave now.

929
01:32:14,229 --> 01:32:16,162
Fight them? With what?

930
01:32:16,164 --> 01:32:18,164
With whatever weapons we have.

931
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:21,034
With stones and rocks
and our bare hands.

932
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:24,070
I will not walk out
into the desert

933
01:32:24,072 --> 01:32:26,239
to starve or to die of thirst.

934
01:32:26,241 --> 01:32:28,875
We have brought enough food
to reach aleppo.

935
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:31,645
You'll never make it. You'll
be murdered along the way.

936
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:35,382
Who are you
to spread such rumors?

937
01:32:40,154 --> 01:32:41,388
Right now...

938
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:43,557
Outside of siroun...

939
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:49,996
You'll find the bodies of every
Armenian from my village

940
01:32:49,998 --> 01:32:52,599
rotting in a river.

941
01:32:52,601 --> 01:32:56,403
Every man, woman and child
marched from their home,

942
01:32:58,873 --> 01:33:01,908
brought there and slaughtered,
all of them.

943
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:03,076
My father.

944
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:05,445
My wife.

945
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:08,582
Stabbed, slashed open.

946
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:12,752
Our unborn child
ripped from her womb.

947
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:17,591
You don't believe me?

948
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:21,161
Hmm?

949
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:24,130
Go.

950
01:33:24,132 --> 01:33:26,399
Go look for yourself.

951
01:33:26,401 --> 01:33:28,268
Follow the vultures
and the smell.

952
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:31,705
You have heard this man.

953
01:33:31,707 --> 01:33:33,974
He speaks the truth.

954
01:33:33,976 --> 01:33:36,843
We will not walk
like sheep to slaughter.

955
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:40,447
We will make refuge
on musa dagh.

956
01:33:40,449 --> 01:33:42,949
And if the turks
will not leave us in peace,

957
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:45,385
we'll fight them
from every rock.

958
01:33:45,387 --> 01:33:47,654
Let's move!

959
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:56,663
Michael.

960
01:33:58,799 --> 01:34:00,300
I'm so sorry.

961
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:04,638
We need to prepare.

962
01:34:21,856 --> 01:34:24,991
Ambassador morgenthau,
my apologies for the delay.

963
01:34:27,428 --> 01:34:30,864
- What is the problem?
- I have reason to believe, talaat pasha,

964
01:34:30,866 --> 01:34:34,267
that your military is about to
execute an American citizen.

965
01:34:34,269 --> 01:34:37,504
We have captured a spy.
He is indeed an American.

966
01:34:37,506 --> 01:34:39,506
Christopher Myers.

967
01:34:39,508 --> 01:34:43,677
Both our countries have the same
punishment for spying during wartime, no?

968
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:46,112
The United States
is not at war with Turkey.

969
01:34:46,114 --> 01:34:49,115
Myers attacked our men, and he has
been collaborating with traitors.

970
01:34:49,117 --> 01:34:51,584
Nonsense. He's
a world-renowned journalist.

971
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:55,288
He's a spy.

972
01:34:55,290 --> 01:34:58,058
And he has used journalism
to smear the ottoman empire

973
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:00,226
and its soldiers
around the world

974
01:35:00,228 --> 01:35:02,962
with his fabrication about the
relocation of the Armenians.

975
01:35:02,964 --> 01:35:08,301
Minister, you are using this
so-called relocation as a cover

976
01:35:08,303 --> 01:35:12,172
for the systematic extermination
of the Armenian people.

977
01:35:12,174 --> 01:35:15,542
Christopher Myers has been reporting
this outrage to the world.

978
01:35:15,544 --> 01:35:17,510
That is why
you want to silence him.

979
01:35:17,512 --> 01:35:20,280
Ambassador, you're Jewish.

980
01:35:21,849 --> 01:35:24,017
Why are you so concerned about
these Armenian christians?

981
01:35:24,019 --> 01:35:27,387
I am a Jew and I am an American.

982
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:31,591
Many Americans
have fled persecution,

983
01:35:31,593 --> 01:35:34,327
and they are appalled
by what is taking place here.

984
01:35:34,329 --> 01:35:36,896
Now, I am making
a formal request

985
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:41,000
that you release Christopher
Myers, and I must caution you.

986
01:35:41,002 --> 01:35:43,036
Any harm done to him

987
01:35:43,038 --> 01:35:47,040
will be considered an act of aggression
against the United States of America.

988
01:35:47,042 --> 01:35:48,308
Good day to you, sir.

989
01:35:50,177 --> 01:35:51,711
One thing, ambassador.

990
01:35:51,713 --> 01:35:53,513
The New York
life insurance company

991
01:35:53,515 --> 01:35:55,615
and the equitable life
of New York have for years

992
01:35:55,617 --> 01:35:57,884
done considerable business
among the Armenians.

993
01:35:57,886 --> 01:36:00,286
I wish you would get these
American life insurance companies

994
01:36:00,288 --> 01:36:03,757
to send us a complete list
of Armenian policyholders.

995
01:36:03,759 --> 01:36:07,694
They're practically all dead now, and they
have left no heirs to collect the money.

996
01:36:07,696 --> 01:36:11,064
It all, of course,
reverts to the state.

997
01:36:11,066 --> 01:36:13,533
The government
is the beneficiary now.

998
01:36:13,535 --> 01:36:16,669
You will never get
any such list from me.

999
01:36:44,331 --> 01:36:45,965
All right.

1000
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:48,468
This is where
we will build our tent.

1001
01:36:49,904 --> 01:36:52,906
It is going to be
the best tent of the camp.

1002
01:36:54,074 --> 01:36:56,109
Who will help me?

1003
01:36:56,111 --> 01:36:57,944
- I will!
- I will!

1004
01:36:57,946 --> 01:36:59,979
Yes! I will! Let's get started.

1005
01:37:04,618 --> 01:37:06,586
We have only a few weapons.

1006
01:37:06,588 --> 01:37:09,489
Don't take one unless you
know how to use it well.

1007
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:14,928
- Can you shoot?
- Yes.

1008
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:20,834
Can you shoot? Yes.

1009
01:37:22,002 --> 01:37:23,503
Can you shoot? Yes.

1010
01:37:49,997 --> 01:37:53,199
Are you the one he fell in
love with in constantinople?

1011
01:37:59,139 --> 01:38:01,040
He told me he loved you.

1012
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:05,378
But I made him marry maral.

1013
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:20,393
You're getting good at this.

1014
01:38:20,395 --> 01:38:22,262
Do you remember
the French song we learned?

1015
01:38:22,264 --> 01:38:24,430
Yes! Yes? Let's sing it.

1016
01:38:24,432 --> 01:38:25,865
Who wants to lead?

1017
01:38:25,867 --> 01:38:27,734
Me, me, me! Hmm.

1018
01:38:27,736 --> 01:38:30,470
Mira.

1019
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:58,358
Come on. Let's go.

1020
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:00,493
Move! I want to
talk to this man.

1021
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:04,030
I thought I was being driven
to an unmarked grave.

1022
01:40:04,032 --> 01:40:06,072
- What's going on?
- You're being deported to Malta.

1023
01:40:06,934 --> 01:40:08,434
How did you know
I'd been captured?

1024
01:40:08,436 --> 01:40:10,036
Someone called the embassy.

1025
01:40:12,506 --> 01:40:13,506
Thank you.

1026
01:40:15,542 --> 01:40:17,543
I have a request.

1027
01:40:17,545 --> 01:40:21,547
Can you contact
a reverend antreassian in bassek

1028
01:40:21,549 --> 01:40:25,518
and find out if Ana khesarian and a
group of orphans reached there safely?

1029
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,720
I'll do my best.
Good luck to you.

1030
01:40:27,722 --> 01:40:28,855
Thank you, sir.

1031
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:44,704
Sir.

1032
01:40:47,908 --> 01:40:49,475
Lieutenant.

1033
01:40:50,644 --> 01:40:52,478
One moment.

1034
01:40:54,581 --> 01:40:57,216
Read that, lieutenant ogan,
in your normal voice.

1035
01:41:05,859 --> 01:41:07,760
"I have important information."

1036
01:41:09,897 --> 01:41:12,899
Reporter Chris Myers is being
held at army headquarters.

1037
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:17,637
"He will... he will be executed."

1038
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:15,795
- They're here.
- Get the men together.

1039
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:29,842
Surrender these weapons.

1040
01:42:29,844 --> 01:42:32,145
Come down,
or we will kill you all.

1041
01:42:32,147 --> 01:42:35,581
All we ask
is to live in peace here.

1042
01:42:50,932 --> 01:42:53,499
Hold fire. Hold fire!

1043
01:42:56,770 --> 01:42:58,671
Hold fire!

1044
01:43:01,475 --> 01:43:03,676
Hold the line! Hold the line!

1045
01:43:15,789 --> 01:43:17,190
- Shoot him! Shoot him!
- Aaah!

1046
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:21,060
Aaah!

1047
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:30,369
Fall back! Fall back!

1048
01:44:15,515 --> 01:44:17,583
Press here. Hard.
As hard as you can.

1049
01:44:23,857 --> 01:44:26,259
I found these tools for you.

1050
01:44:26,261 --> 01:44:28,628
Give those to sosi, please.
And I need more alcohol.

1051
01:44:35,068 --> 01:44:37,436
Take these and boil them.
Fifteen minutes. All right.

1052
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:52,752
The turks will be back soon.

1053
01:44:52,754 --> 01:44:55,321
Tomorrow at dawn,
we will climb higher.

1054
01:44:55,323 --> 01:44:57,490
Everything
that cannot be carried,

1055
01:44:57,492 --> 01:44:59,392
should be destroyed.

1056
01:44:59,394 --> 01:45:01,394
Livestock, carts.

1057
01:45:01,396 --> 01:45:03,329
If you cannot carry it, burn it.

1058
01:45:05,666 --> 01:45:07,199
There it is.

1059
01:45:14,975 --> 01:45:15,975
Aaah.

1060
01:45:29,423 --> 01:45:31,691
Here. I made you some tea.

1061
01:45:36,496 --> 01:45:37,496
Thank you.

1062
01:45:42,269 --> 01:45:43,703
I couldn't do it.

1063
01:45:48,275 --> 01:45:50,009
I couldn't pull the trigger.

1064
01:46:28,215 --> 01:46:31,016
Pasha. The Armenians
ambushed us.

1065
01:46:31,018 --> 01:46:35,354
There were hundreds of Armenian gunmen,
well armed, with snipers positioned.

1066
01:46:35,356 --> 01:46:37,056
They appeared to be retreating.
So then...

1067
01:46:37,058 --> 01:46:39,258
Enough.

1068
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:41,727
Mobilize the third division
and the artillery.

1069
01:46:48,335 --> 01:46:49,502
Admiral. Admiral fournet?

1070
01:46:51,004 --> 01:46:53,906
I'm Christopher Myers
with the associated press.

1071
01:46:53,908 --> 01:46:56,509
I'm told that you plan to investigate
the plight of the Armenians

1072
01:46:56,511 --> 01:46:57,743
on the turkish coast.

1073
01:46:57,745 --> 01:46:59,912
That is restricted information.

1074
01:46:59,914 --> 01:47:02,081
Would you permit me
to sail with you?

1075
01:47:03,383 --> 01:47:05,084
Why would I do that?

1076
01:47:05,086 --> 01:47:07,353
If you want the United
States to join this war,

1077
01:47:07,355 --> 01:47:09,455
the American public need to
know what the enemy is doing

1078
01:47:09,457 --> 01:47:11,190
and what you're doing
to fight them.

1079
01:47:31,611 --> 01:47:34,713
Everyone, find a place to camp.

1080
01:48:10,317 --> 01:48:11,484
Thank you.

1081
01:48:15,655 --> 01:48:17,523
Marta, I have some soup for you.

1082
01:48:22,128 --> 01:48:23,162
Marta?

1083
01:48:29,836 --> 01:48:31,036
Oh.

1084
01:48:35,876 --> 01:48:39,345
Dear lord,
take your loving child marta,

1085
01:48:40,647 --> 01:48:43,349
who endured all
with such bravery.

1086
01:48:44,718 --> 01:48:46,285
Take her into your care...

1087
01:48:47,487 --> 01:48:51,323
With as much love
as she gave to us.

1088
01:48:51,325 --> 01:48:53,025
Amen.

1089
01:48:53,027 --> 01:48:54,193
Amen. Amen.

1090
01:49:10,243 --> 01:49:12,044
We were always arguing.

1091
01:49:13,313 --> 01:49:14,880
We'd fight all the time.

1092
01:49:16,249 --> 01:49:19,118
She would fight more with me
than with my father.

1093
01:49:24,190 --> 01:49:26,258
I think it's because
we are the most alike.

1094
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:34,733
My mama.

1095
01:49:41,341 --> 01:49:42,775
They're all gone now.

1096
01:49:46,212 --> 01:49:48,581
Yeva and I are all that's
left of my family.

1097
01:49:56,256 --> 01:49:57,823
I know...

1098
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:01,493
That it won't bring
any of them back,

1099
01:50:04,230 --> 01:50:06,165
but god help me, I want revenge.

1100
01:50:09,703 --> 01:50:11,036
I don't care.

1101
01:50:12,305 --> 01:50:13,439
Hey.

1102
01:50:16,776 --> 01:50:18,844
Our revenge will be to survive.

1103
01:50:51,112 --> 01:50:54,980
Fast! Run! Run! Run! Run!
Run! Fast as you can!

1104
01:50:54,982 --> 01:50:57,149
Everyone stay down!
Keep your head down!

1105
01:50:58,752 --> 01:51:00,519
Come!

1106
01:51:00,521 --> 01:51:02,087
Mira, behind the rocks!

1107
01:51:03,357 --> 01:51:05,658
- Oh!
- Get down! Stay down!

1108
01:51:08,428 --> 01:51:10,829
- It's all right.
- You're all right.

1109
01:51:10,831 --> 01:51:11,997
Come, here.

1110
01:51:29,383 --> 01:51:31,817
Reverend, they say the turks
will kill us all.

1111
01:51:31,819 --> 01:51:33,886
It's not true.

1112
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:35,854
God will protect us, yes?

1113
01:51:36,956 --> 01:51:38,590
Let's pray together.

1114
01:51:45,232 --> 01:51:46,465
Dear lord,

1115
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:49,568
the light of all goodness
and mercy...

1116
01:51:50,838 --> 01:51:53,539
<i>Please protect us
in our hour of need</i>

1117
01:51:53,541 --> 01:51:57,743
<i>and help us survive
these cruel times</i>

1118
01:51:57,745 --> 01:52:01,080
<i>so we may once more
sing your praises.</i>

1119
01:52:15,261 --> 01:52:18,063
A French battleship
is steaming toward the coast.

1120
01:52:18,065 --> 01:52:19,732
Tomorrow I want
the final assault.

1121
01:52:28,341 --> 01:52:29,842
Look! Look, there!

1122
01:52:31,344 --> 01:52:34,713
Light the bonfires.
Get everyone down to the beach.

1123
01:52:42,889 --> 01:52:45,257
Easy. On my command.

1124
01:52:49,395 --> 01:52:51,930
Go, go, go! Go!

1125
01:52:51,932 --> 01:52:53,999
To the beach! Everyone, hurry!

1126
01:53:32,305 --> 01:53:33,972
Admiral, I need to be there.

1127
01:53:51,191 --> 01:53:53,425
Hurry! Hurry, everyone!

1128
01:53:53,427 --> 01:53:55,194
Bring the children!

1129
01:54:06,873 --> 01:54:08,807
Have you seen children?
Have you seen children?

1130
01:54:08,809 --> 01:54:10,676
A group of orphans with Ana...

1131
01:54:23,556 --> 01:54:24,857
Ana!

1132
01:54:25,892 --> 01:54:27,526
- Chris?
- Ana!

1133
01:54:27,528 --> 01:54:28,528
Oh, Chris!

1134
01:54:30,029 --> 01:54:32,297
- Oh, thank god!
- Oh, my god!

1135
01:54:39,506 --> 01:54:41,406
- <i>Allez! Vite! Vite!</i>
- Where's Michael?

1136
01:54:41,408 --> 01:54:43,709
- He's coming behind us.
- Quickly, everyone. Come on.

1137
01:54:58,524 --> 01:55:01,393
Stay together. I'm going back to help.
Keep close to me.

1138
01:55:10,036 --> 01:55:11,770
- Chris.
- Michael.

1139
01:55:13,006 --> 01:55:15,674
You survived. Thank god.

1140
01:55:15,676 --> 01:55:16,942
How can I help?

1141
01:55:16,944 --> 01:55:18,110
The people there.

1142
01:55:20,013 --> 01:55:21,546
Help them down.

1143
01:55:21,548 --> 01:55:23,015
Thank you, Chris.

1144
01:55:48,442 --> 01:55:50,142
She's injured.

1145
01:55:56,082 --> 01:55:57,282
Michael!

1146
01:56:08,928 --> 01:56:10,996
Ana! Michael!

1147
01:56:10,998 --> 01:56:13,298
Did you... did you see Chris?
Yes.

1148
01:56:13,300 --> 01:56:14,866
Yes. He's on his way down.

1149
01:56:34,253 --> 01:56:36,989
I love you. I love you.

1150
01:56:44,998 --> 01:56:46,498
Let me help you.

1151
01:56:52,772 --> 01:56:55,173
Get your leg up.

1152
01:57:15,661 --> 01:57:16,895
This will help.

1153
01:57:16,897 --> 01:57:19,498
Here. Put this on.

1154
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:21,133
All right,
you should put this on.

1155
01:57:21,135 --> 01:57:22,801
Put your hands up.

1156
01:57:36,849 --> 01:57:38,050
Help!

1157
01:57:42,555 --> 01:57:45,090
Help us! Hold on. Hold on.

1158
01:57:45,092 --> 01:57:47,225
Michael!

1159
01:57:48,996 --> 01:57:50,996
Ana! Ana! Michael!

1160
01:57:50,998 --> 01:57:53,665
Help!

1161
01:57:53,667 --> 01:57:55,233
Ana!

1162
01:58:04,945 --> 01:58:07,779
Help!

1163
01:58:07,781 --> 01:58:09,281
Ana!

1164
01:58:10,950 --> 01:58:14,286
Ana!

1165
01:58:18,458 --> 01:58:20,459
Ana!

1166
01:58:58,798 --> 01:59:00,132
Ah!

1167
01:59:06,439 --> 01:59:09,374
Yeva!

1168
01:59:13,981 --> 01:59:15,313
He... help!

1169
01:59:30,763 --> 01:59:32,597
Where's Ana?

1170
01:59:32,599 --> 01:59:34,166
Where's Ana?

1171
02:00:09,202 --> 02:00:10,235
Michael.

1172
02:00:13,206 --> 02:00:14,906
Michael!

1173
02:00:20,713 --> 02:00:22,214
Where is she?

1174
02:00:24,150 --> 02:00:25,317
Michael.

1175
02:00:27,553 --> 02:00:28,587
Michael.

1176
02:01:25,811 --> 02:01:27,779
<i>There was nothing
that could be said.</i>

1177
02:01:29,248 --> 02:01:31,616
<i>Both of us had lost
the woman we loved.</i>

1178
02:01:36,289 --> 02:01:39,124
<i>The French took us
to a refugee camp in Egypt.</i>

1179
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:45,130
<i>Chris arranged for us visas
for me, yeva and the orphans.</i>

1180
02:01:47,466 --> 02:01:50,635
<i>We lost Chris in 1938.</i>

1181
02:01:52,271 --> 02:01:55,807
<i>He died while reporting
on the Spanish civil war.</i>

1182
02:01:58,744 --> 02:02:02,314
<i>I adopted yeva,
finished my medical studies</i>

1183
02:02:02,316 --> 02:02:05,817
<i>and set up a practice
in watertown, Massachusetts.</i>

1184
02:02:05,819 --> 02:02:08,353
<i>After the Japanese
attacked Pearl harbor,</i>

1185
02:02:08,355 --> 02:02:11,289
<i>yeva joined
the women's army corps</i>

1186
02:02:11,291 --> 02:02:14,025
<i>and fell in love
with a young marine lieutenant.</i>

1187
02:02:15,795 --> 02:02:17,996
<i>And on her wedding day,</i>

1188
02:02:17,998 --> 02:02:20,699
<i>the orphans joined us
in celebration.</i>

1189
02:02:34,113 --> 02:02:35,547
A toast in Armenian?

1190
02:02:48,894 --> 02:02:50,729
May they return safely to us.

1191
02:02:50,731 --> 02:02:52,230
Cheers.

1192
02:02:55,201 --> 02:02:57,669
My darling yeva

1193
02:02:57,671 --> 02:03:00,238
told me that her greatest wish

1194
02:03:00,240 --> 02:03:04,209
was that her parents
and our dear Ana were here.

1195
02:03:06,245 --> 02:03:09,647
I told her I know that they are.

1196
02:03:09,649 --> 02:03:11,516
For sure, they are here.

1197
02:03:11,518 --> 02:03:13,918
And all of your parents

1198
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:17,589
and all those families lost

1199
02:03:17,591 --> 02:03:21,393
in an attempt to wipe our nation
from the face of the earth.

1200
02:03:22,828 --> 02:03:24,262
But we're still here.

1201
02:03:27,366 --> 02:03:29,234
We're still here.
