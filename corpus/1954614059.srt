2
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,150
My friend Nicholas Brady, who in
his own way tried to save the

3
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:55,521
world, lived in Berkeley
practically his whole life.

4
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:59,491
Back around 1985, Berkeley,
California seemed like an oasis

5
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:03,128
in a country that had become
polarized and divided.

6
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,231
But Fate or God or
whatever had something else

7
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,500
in store for my
friend Nick

8
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:12,538
and as it turned out,
for me, too.

9
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,615
Look, Nick, I appreciate your
interest in the business,

10
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:26,452
but these compact discs
aren't going to catch on.

11
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:28,520
Not with our customers.

12
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:29,755
Why not?

13
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,324
That digital sound
is too perfect.

14
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:33,625
It's cold.

15
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,360
Metallic.

16
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:38,263
Don't underestimate
the human element.

17
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:41,200
Even if CDs catch on, the
records here will

18
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:43,535
be worth a fortune.

19
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:46,438
Or nothing at all.

20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,240
Life's a gamble.

21
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,242
Be patient.

22
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,578
One day it's all
going to be yours

23
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,416
and Rachel's, then you
can do what you like.

00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:13,265

Hey.

35
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:26,398
Phil just called and
he's on his way over.

36
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,634
Please don't tell
him about last night.

37
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:31,637
Promise?

38
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,339
Mm.

39
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,545
Muah.

40
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,713
Have a good day.

41
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,616
Bye, baby.

42
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,551
Sorry, I'm late.

43
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,721
My cat got run over
by a truck yesterday.

44
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,190
That's the bad news.

45
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,526
What's the good news?

46
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,762
My new novel,
getting published.

47
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,530
In hardcover this time.

48
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,332
Oh, wow, that's
great, man.

49
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:01,700
Which one?

50
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,368
The one about what
might have happened

51
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,773
if the Nazis won
the war.

52
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:09,741
I have an idea you might
be interested in.

53
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:15,714
Last night, I woke up and I saw
me staring down at myself.

54
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:18,717
I think Rachel saw it,
too, but now she's not sure.

55
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,285
That's weird.

56
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,254
Were you high?

57
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,556
You know I don't
smoke anymore.

58
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,993
I think it was
a future me.

59
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:31,396
Could something like that
be possible, time travel?

60
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:34,700
It seemed like I was there to
help me or warn me or something.

61
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,702
Might be.

62
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:38,303
Did you look any older?

63
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,472
No, I looked
exactly the same.

64
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:43,375
Maybe it was an alternate self
communicating with you from an

65
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,477
alternate universe.

66
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,579
Can you use the idea?

67
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,581
Nope, too ordinary.

68
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,716
Too ordinary, huh?

69
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:54,720
Well, that's--
that's me.

70
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,521
Cheer up.

71
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,724
You're still having
a better day than my cat.

72
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:02,761
And so, while the membership
lists were destroyed prior

73
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,330
to the collapse of
the Soviet Union,

74
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:07,599
the code name for this
organization has been given

75
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:10,402
to us by our new
Russian allies.

76
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:13,071
That name is Aramchek,

77
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:16,441
an agency of treason
and subversion.

78
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,009
Aramchek.

79
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,011
Remember that name.

80
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:24,015
This secret organization
refuses to acknowledge that

81
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,785
democracy and free
enterprise have triumphed.

82
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:29,755
Instead, they would
turn back the clock,

83
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:32,991
lead America into a dark
shadowy future of a godless

84
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,060
dictatorship.

85
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:39,264
In the near future, I intend to
report to you, the American

86
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:44,770
people, the progress of our war
on this cadre of evildoers.

87
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:47,773
In the meantime,
good night,

88
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:52,077
and may God bless the
United States of America.

89
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,446
The President's address this
evening contained a real

90
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,481
bombshell,
didn't it Hugh?

91
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:59,050
And I wouldn't be surprised if
this new crisis didn't have

92
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:02,087
some bearing on President
Fremont's decision whether or

93
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:06,425
not to seek an unprecedented
fifth term in office--

94
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,627
15 years in office.

95
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,462
You'd think that would
be enough for anyone.

96
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,531
Not Fremont.

97
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:16,468
The only way you get him out of
the Oval Office is in a casket.

98
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:37,055
A record store clerk in Berkeley
will have many troubles.

99
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:41,626
When he moves to Los Angeles,
he will find what he's been

100
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:45,096
searching for
his entire life.

101
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:57,008
I've had the strangest feeling
the last couple of days.

102
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,012
It's like I've been asleep
my whole life waiting for

103
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:04,049
something to happen.

104
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:07,152
We gotta get out
of Berkeley.

105
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:11,056
And how do you
plan on that?

106
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:15,060
I'm thinking of
applying for a new job.

107
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,595
I've already started talking to
some of the record company reps

108
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,531
down in LA.

109
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,541
Maybe they're just
ordinary dreams.

110
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,210
Night after night?

111
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,745
The images always appears
between 3:00 and 4:00

112
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,081
in the morning.

113
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,049
I think I'm being
programmed in my sleep.

114
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,584
Just because I write science-
fiction, doesn't mean I believe

115
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,186
in any of that stuff.

116
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:46,024
I don't even think flying
saucers are real.

117
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:50,061
I think a higher intelligence
has seen my needs and is

118
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,097
directing me towards
something important,

119
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:55,734
some extraordinary goal.

120
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:02,541
So, a powerful
entity guiding you,

121
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,609
helping you get
your shit together?

122
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,578
Sounds good, what do
you think it is?

123
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,146
Don't laugh, but I've
got a name for it.

124
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:11,149
I call it VALIS.

125
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,184
VALIS?

126
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:19,090
It's an acronym for Vast Active
Living Intelligent System,

127
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:24,129
because that's exactly what
it is and how I think of it.

128
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:26,097
Does this VALIS provide
you with any clues

129
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:29,467
as to your
amazing destiny?

130
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,635
I don't have any choice
other than to believe it.

131
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:35,140
I already got
a job offer.

132
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:37,442
Progressive Records is the
first company I applied to,

133
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:41,079
that's got
to mean something.

134
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,781
Just one problem.

135
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:46,117
What's that?

136
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:49,120
I hate Los Angeles.

137
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,056
Just for the sake of argument,
let's suppose it's something

138
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:54,492
evil like the voices
that told Mark Chapman

139
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:57,095
to shoot Mick Jagger.

140
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,098
VALIS has a destiny
for me in LA.

141
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,733
What am I supposed
to say to that?

142
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,134
This is real.

143
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,738
This is happening to me.

144
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,140
Maybe it's
a precognition.

145
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:12,510
Knowing what you're going
to do before you do it.

146
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,479
I wrote a story
about that, remember?

147
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:15,780
"The World Jones Made"?

148
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,148
Vaguely.

149
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,117
How'd that turn out?

150
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,152
Not so good.

151
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:24,155
Instead of being this wonderful
talent, being able to see a year

152
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:29,094
into the future, it locked
Jones into a closed loop.

153
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,262
He lost free choice.

154
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,131
What do you mean?

155
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,200
Well, since everything
was pre-determined,

156
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:39,237
he was forced to act
out his own future.

157
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,506
You foresee yourself
moving to LA.

158
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,009
So now you're moving.

159
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,211
You still don't
understand.

160
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:53,084
VALIS knows about you.

161
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:57,555
I was instructed to tell
you what's happening.

162
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,193
You're putting me on.

163
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,169
It's crazy, Nick.

164
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,705
We're leaving Berkeley
because some imaginary voice

165
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:18,209
tells you to uproot
our lives?

166
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:21,312
It's not a practical way to
make a life-changing decision.

167
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,548
What's better?

168
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,217
Columbus listening to the
imaginary voices in his head

169
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:30,055
that said "keep sailing" or the
real voices that said it was

170
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:33,692
all hopeless
and doomed.

171
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:36,227
Aren't results
what matter?

172
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:55,146
See you guys
after lunch.

173
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,218
Hey, Phil!

174
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,253
I was starting to think you were
going to miss our last day!

175
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,289
What, are you kidding?
Not a chance.

176
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,325
I even brought
refreshments.

177
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:10,128
Hi.

178
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,198
So.

179
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,734
None for me thanks.

180
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,269
That's the first drink
I've ever seen you refuse.

181
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,271
Did VALIS tell you to
go on the wagon?

182
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,307
As a matter
of fact, yes.

183
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:25,176
Oh, come on, baby,
lighten up.

184
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,277
You know, I've been trying
to get him to cut back

185
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,146
on alcohol for years.

186
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,281
His wife, he ignores, but one
little word from the Big Mind

187
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,117
in the sky...

188
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:35,253
All right,
okay, enough.

189
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,159
To friendship.

190
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,061
To Los Angeles.

191
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,230
To destiny.

192
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,265
Destiny.

193
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:55,740
Oh God, excuse me.

194
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:02,046
Could he get
any weirder?

195
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:05,283
How are you supposed to
relate to a friend whose life

196
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,286
is directed from
beyond the stars?

197
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,256
I mean, what kind of attitude
am I supposed to take to that?

198
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:14,325
Imagine being his wife.

199
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,261
It's taken over your
lives, hasn't it?

200
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:19,030
And the strange part is,
VALIS is doing a better job

201
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,132
than we ever did.

202
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,168
I've never seen
Nick so....

203
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,336
Motivated.

204
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:28,239
It's like he's an entirely
different person.

205
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:32,210
Yeah.

206
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,024
I've been thinking
about leaving him.

207
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,360
Wow.

208
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:52,030
What did you decide?

209
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:56,668
The decision has
been made for me.

210
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,306
I saw a gynecologist
last week.

211
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:04,209
I'm pregnant.

212
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:12,350
That's wonderful.

213
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:16,020
I haven't told Nick.

214
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,355
Okay.

215
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:21,426
I'm scared about
everything.

216
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,333
Tell me it's all
going to be okay.

217
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,201
Of course.

218
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,704
Of course it's
gonna be okay.

219
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:39,177
Though the Cold War may be over,
as you know, the secret

220
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:43,214
organization Aramchek is still
committed to undermining our

221
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,084
democratic institutions.

222
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:50,021
Accordingly, I have instructed
our Attorney General to prepare

223
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:54,025
the appropriate legislation to
amend those First Amendment

224
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:57,328
rights that have been so long
abused by our country's foes

225
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:01,466
and their unwitting allies
among the media elite.

226
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:08,106
No one regrets these measures
more than your President.

227
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:11,242
And so, following the
instructions of VALIS,

228
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,345
my friends Nick and Rachel
moved down to LA.

229
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:18,116
I thought of them often, but
it was more than a year until

230
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:21,119
I took the eight-hour bus ride
down from Berkeley.

231
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,422
Excuse me, sir.

232
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,158
Can I give you
the good news?

233
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,504
Jesus Christ.

234
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,372
I never thought
I'd see the day.

235
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:44,175
An old socialist like you
driving around in a Beamer.

236
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,017
You look great.

237
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,118
Yeah?

238
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,754
LA seems to
agree with you.

239
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:59,324
Still doing your art?

240
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,426
No, not so much.

241
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:06,097
I've been really busy,
with the baby and all.

242
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,298
How's Nick?

243
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,133
Oh, he's-- he's great.

244
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,468
He loves it here, too.

245
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,437
You know, he wanted
to pick you up himself,

246
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:15,406
but he's in the studio with
one of his new groups.

247
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:19,410
What about VALIS?

248
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,013
Phil, look,
do me a favor.

249
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,382
Don't bring up
that stuff.

250
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,285
Wow.

251
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,520
A far cry from
the record store, huh?

252
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,303
Hey, Phil.

253
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,337
Glad you could make it.

254
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,373
Get in here.

255
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,709
I want you to stick around
and check these guys out.

256
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,345
I'm gonna get a producer
credit on this album,

257
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,381
maybe a senior vice-presidency
if market research is right

258
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:59,784
about these guys.

259
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,523
You believing it?

260
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,492
Believe what?

261
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:11,529
All this, my act.

262
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,498
What are you
talking about?

263
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,034
So you bought it, too.

264
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:19,170
That's good, that means I must
be doing something right.

265
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,153
Check it out.

266
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:39,557
This is an image that I've been
shown over and over again.

267
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,567
What the hell?

268
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,303
Was that lightning?

269
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,506
Hey.

270
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,075
Nick?

271
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,343
Hey.

272
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,214
You okay?

273
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,287
I don't know why we
had to rush over here.

274
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,189
Ezra's just fine.

275
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,423
No, he's not,
I told you.

276
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,560
He has a birth defect.

277
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:16,794
Good morning.

278
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:20,531
Hey, Doctor,
thank you for coming.

279
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:23,534
He has an inguinal strangulated
hernia on the left side.

280
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:26,537
It's already descended
into the scrotal sac.

281
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:30,508
I'm used to parents imagining
dreadful diseases in the middle

282
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,412
of the night, but rarely
with such specificity.

283
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:38,082
I just saw Ezra
last week, but...

284
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:41,552
It's okay, it's all right,
it's okay...

285
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:48,126
Wait a second.

286
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,396
Page Dr. Andrews, tell
him to come right in,

287
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:55,099
it's an emergency.

288
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,205
I don't know what to tell you,
it's exactly what you thought.

289
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,240
Is he going
to be alright?

290
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,441
Yeah, he'll be fine.

291
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,143
It's a minor
problem to correct,

292
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,544
but it's potentially
very dangerous.

293
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,547
We caught it
just in time.

294
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,356
Hey.

295
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,657
How is he?

296
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,727
Ezra's going
to be fine.

297
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:25,296
What's going on?

298
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:27,165
How did you know that?

299
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,568
Was it VALIS?

300
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,670
Let's get Ezra
and Rachel home first,

301
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,339
then I'll fill you
in on everything.

302
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:47,451
I'm always amazed at how much
difference the desert air makes.

303
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,588
A lot cleaner than LA,
isn't it?

304
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:55,326
No spies,
no police informers.

305
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:59,597
Out here, the wind blows in
from the east and north.

306
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,367
For some reason,
the signal's much stronger.

307
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:07,305
I think VALIS is located
in our upper atmosphere.

308
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,440
How is that
even possible?

309
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,176
How could any kind of living
creature exist up there,

310
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,477
survive?

311
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,313
No, see, it's not--

312
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,748
It's not a he or
she or even an it.

313
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,284
It's a composite entity.

314
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:23,621
It's as if various beings had
come together and formed

315
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:27,491
a single body
and group mind.

316
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:30,461
How do you know
all this?

317
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:34,332
I've had dream after dream after
dream from their point of view.

318
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:36,634
From way up,
looking down.

319
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:41,372
To them earth is like this
horrible, stagnant pond and

320
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:47,645
human beings just swim around
in the muck trying to survive.

321
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:51,649
I think they're
anxious to help us.

322
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:54,252
That doesn't make
sense to me.

323
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,654
Highly evolved creature living
in the sky taking an active

324
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:59,690
interest in
human welfare?

325
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,559
Why would they?

326
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,661
I think they feel
sorry for us.

327
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,730
Try to imagine it.

328
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:07,531
Advanced beings
living alongside

329
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:10,401
the human race
throughout history,

330
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,236
watching our wars
and famines,

331
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:14,372
observing our
unbelievable cruelty,

332
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:17,742
our unbelievable
stupidity.

333
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,779
Wait a second, hold on.

334
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,784
I'm getting new
instructions.

335
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:37,395
You're never going to believe
where they want me to go.

336
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:41,232
...So, this modest bungalow is
the house where the president

337
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:44,201
actually grew up in
his formative years,

338
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:47,405
the dwelling where our beloved
leader first did homework,

339
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:50,541
first played basketball, first
read inspiring biographies

340
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:52,376
of history's
greatest men.

341
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,706
Don't worry,
there's no guards.

342
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,608
I guess they figure
no one would dare trespass

343
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,777
on the holiest
of holies.

344
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,647
Maybe they
have a point.

345
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,717
There it is.

346
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,785
What's the big deal?

347
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,687
It's just a signature
in the cement.

348
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,789
Probably the name
of the contractor.

349
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,525
Baby, look at it,
look at the name.

350
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,794
It's a little faded and hard
to read, but you see it,

351
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:46,030
right, Phil?

352
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm seeing it,
but I can't believe it.

353
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:54,071
Aramchek.

354
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:57,441
I get this urge to go
to the Fremont Museum.

355
00:22:57,443 --> 00:23:02,413
I wander away from
the group I see it.

356
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,448
Then I realize,
I was meant to see it.

357
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,750
Please don't tell me
you're starting up again

358
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:07,585
with the whole
VALIS thing.

359
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:12,456
Little Richard Fremont played in
that backyard and saw the name

360
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,759
written in the
cement, Aramchek,

361
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:17,795
and for whatever reason it
sticks in his little brain

362
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:20,498
as something sinister.

363
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,001
Once the boy grows up,
he projects his paranoia

364
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,370
on the whole world.

365
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:31,375
Aramchek, the super-secret
cabal of evil revolutionaries.

366
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:34,678
it's a figment of
his imagination.

367
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,114
A childhood memory.

368
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,016
It's genius.

369
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:41,652
The government declares war on
a terrorist organization that

370
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:44,054
doesn't even exist.

371
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:45,656
No one can
destroy it.

372
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:48,626
No one's safe from it.

373
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,361
No one knows when
it'll turn up again.

374
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:54,031
What do you think
happened to Mr. Aramchek,

375
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,000
Whoever he
actually was?

376
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:58,636
He's dead.

377
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:01,705
Or stuck away in some
rehabilitation camp.

378
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:05,342
What else would you expect
from Richard Fremont?

379
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,550
Do you really have
to go back to Berkeley?

380
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:14,518
Yeah.

381
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,021
I gotta finish my book.

382
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:20,558
Besides, I can't be your house
guest forever, you know?

383
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:27,431
It's gotten so...
weird all of a sudden.

384
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,001
No, man, you--
you just--

385
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:33,037
You do what
you need to do.

386
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,039
We'll be fine.

387
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:38,342
We have VALIS
to protect us.

388
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:40,644
Back in Berkeley my life
returned to normal,

389
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,513
which for me was
mostly work,

390
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:45,082
staying up all night with
the help of amphetamines.

391
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,017
While I was in LA, Nick and
I had spent hour after hour

392
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,086
talking about VALIS,

393
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:52,556
different theories about how it
operated, what it wanted,

394
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,059
why it had come now.

395
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:57,728
I had material for a dozen
stories just based on all

396
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,564
the premises
we spun out,

397
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:03,100
but none that I could write
about without betraying

398
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:06,070
my friend's confidence.

399
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,512
Gentlemen.

400
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,417
What can I do for you?

401
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:22,086
Are we putting out too
many protest songs?

402
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:24,121
No, on the contrary,
Mr. Brady.

403
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:25,589
May I call you Nick?

404
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:27,458
Sure.

405
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,593
Progressive has a very positive
rating with the Bureau, Nick.

406
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:32,763
One of the best in the whole
recording industry.

407
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:35,432
Just a precaution.

408
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:37,101
You'd be surprised
how many otherwise decent,

409
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:38,736
law-abiding Americans

410
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:41,071
think it's necessary to tape
informal interrogations like

411
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:45,075
this one.

412
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,144
How can I help you?

413
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:49,580
Actually, we're here
to help you, Nick.

414
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:51,482
We happen to know you're
currently under a great deal

415
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:54,084
of financial pressure.

416
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:58,422
Your wife wants your son to go
to an exclusive nursery school.

417
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:01,025
She also expects you to
put a large down payment

418
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:04,028
on a much larger house.

419
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,697
We're prepared to offer you
a simple, patriotic way

420
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:10,067
to enhance your salary
by up to $2,000 a month.

421
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,602
How does that
sound Nick?

422
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:13,137
Tax free.

423
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:15,105
Not even reportable.

424
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:19,043
I'm flattered you'd thought
of me but honestly, I have a--

425
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:20,110
Are you turning your country
down before you even know

426
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:22,780
what we're asking?

427
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:25,649
Maybe your loyalty evaluation
needs to be updated.

428
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:27,685
Wouldn't take any
extra work at all.

429
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:31,221
It's a function of work
you're already doing.

430
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:34,191
All right, I'll listen.

431
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:36,226
It's very
simple, really.

432
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:39,163
See, despite the generally
cooperative attitude of radio

433
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:42,533
stations and music executives
like yourself,

434
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:44,568
a number of anti-social
protest songs

435
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,471
are still
getting airplay...

436
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,177
Subject Nicholas Brady refused
to cooperate with the current

437
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,179
investigation.

438
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:57,147
The following is
a transcript of the conversation

439
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:59,216
taped with the subject.

440
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,619
Recommendation is for this file
to be sent to Washington

441
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:04,221
for inclusion in
Project Coliseum.

442
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:06,523
What can I do
for you?

443
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:08,158
Are we putting out too
many protest songs?

444
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,095
No, on the contrary,
Mr. Brady.

445
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:40,290
So you're certain nothing of
actual monetary value was taken?

446
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,159
Yeah, just
some papers.

447
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:45,062
Notes for my
new novel.

448
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:47,765
Fortunately, I've got a copy
that I keep with a friend.

449
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:50,534
Well, that seems like
a strange practice.

450
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,236
It's almost as if you were
anticipating some kind

451
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:54,071
of problem like this.

452
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:55,105
Not really.

453
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:57,641
It's just, uh...

454
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,184
I've been told you write some
very far-out science fiction.

455
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:10,187
Are you willing to testify under
oath that this isn't some kind

456
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,257
of crazy
publicity stunt?
Are you suggesting--

457
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:16,260
I'm not suggesting anything, but
we're inclined to believe you

458
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:18,562
staged this
break-in yourself.
Yeah?

459
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:21,331
Why would I trash my own house
and ransack my own files?

460
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,734
What better way to throw
suspicion off yourself?

461
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:25,703
Suspicion?
Suspicion of what?

462
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:28,172
That's what we're going to
need to investigate further.

463
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:30,140
I hope you'll make yourself
available for further

464
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:31,308
questioning, if necessary.

465
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,243
No, I'm going home.

466
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:35,779
Forget about the burglary,
forget about the police report.

467
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:40,350
A little late
for that, sir.

468
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:44,188
You almost can't blame the
government for being curious.

469
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,224
Half your stories read like
they were written on acid.

470
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,760
Your entire readership consists
of freaks and misfits.

471
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:51,428
Okay.

472
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,463
So they're curious, that
doesn't give them the right

473
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:54,298
to break into my house.

474
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,267
They probably just want to
know about your next novel.

475
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,169
I'd like to know, too.

476
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,371
It's called "Flow My Tears,
the Policeman Said."

477
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:03,240
Sounds political.

478
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,475
No.

479
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:06,643
Well, sort of,
it's like all my stuff.

480
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,278
Did they get
the manuscript?

481
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,114
No, I sent it
to my lawyer.

482
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:11,749
It's in his safe.

483
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,617
I sent it over as soon
as I was finished.

484
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:17,254
It's time for you
move down here.

485
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,023
We should wait to talk
'til I get to LA.

486
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,759
With any luck, this thing
will just blow over.

487
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,594
Not likely.

488
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:28,365
Once the authorities open a file
on someone, they never close it.

489
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:31,268
I'll talk to you soon.

490
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,108
My books were finally
finding an audience.

491
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,311
I was getting solid
critical reviews too,

492
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,413
especially on my really
insane novel,

493
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:47,384
"The Three Stigmata
of Palmer Eldritch."

494
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:49,319
The rumor got started that I'd
written it under the influence

495
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:52,055
of LSD.

496
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,027
The notoriety had undoubtedly
brought me to the attention

497
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:58,796
of the authorities,

498
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:01,799
but it had also
paid off in sales.

499
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:04,134
I was able to make a down
payment on a small bungalow

500
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:07,337
in the grungy Echo Park
area of LA.

501
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:11,408
When I wasn't working, I went
back as usual to hanging out

502
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,344
with Nick and Rachel.

503
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:21,418
My fellow Americans, this
evening's report will deal with

504
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,355
the remarkable progress we've
made this quarter with our
domestic

505
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:28,258
exports, despite
a temporary setback

506
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,195
in the agricultural
sector.

507
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:34,431
The unforeseeable effects of
terrorism and subversion remain

508
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:37,201
the only question
mark for our country's

509
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:40,170
continued
economic health.

510
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:47,077
You know, at first I thought
these test questions were easy,

511
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,545
just to see if we're
paying attention,

512
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:51,315
but once you actually start
thinking about them,

513
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:53,584
they're kind of tricky.

514
00:30:53,586 --> 00:30:56,053
"If American citizens must

515
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:58,388
give up certain liberties
in the fight for freedom

516
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,224
does it mean
the country is,

517
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:03,193
"A," gaining ground or "B,"
losing ground in the war

518
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,428
against subversion.

519
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,397
Well, you can argue
it both ways.

520
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:10,133
By giving up liberties, maybe
they want us to say we can gain

521
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:13,203
ground by fighting
with our gloves off.

522
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,205
If weren't losing ground, we
wouldn't have to give up our

523
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,373
liberties.

524
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,275
It's a mindfuck.

525
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:20,177
Yeah.

526
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:21,612
If that's the kind of crap
they're teaching the kids

527
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:26,083
nowadays, no wonder
SAT scores are going down.

528
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:29,086
Make sure you mail in
our tests tomorrow.

529
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:33,056
We can't afford another

What an amazing voice.

543
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:17,461
Who is she?

544
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:19,162
Are you kidding?

545
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,297
It's Sylvia.

546
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:21,465
She's on your label.

547
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:23,333
You signed her.

548
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,068
What's wrong
with you, honey?

549
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,304
How could you have
forgotten that?

550
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:30,440
I must be really tired.

551
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:33,310
I can't put my
finger on it,

552
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:37,014
but there's something
subversive in her music.

553
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:20,490
7:00 in the
fucking morning.

554
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:31,435
Just a minute.

555
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,649
Sorry to bother
you so early.

556
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:49,052
I'm Vivian Kaplan and this
is my partner, Ted Pollett.

557
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:53,623
We're volunteer workers with
Friends of the American People.
FAP?

558
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:56,526
Please, sir, we prefer you use
our organization's full name,

559
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,395
Friends of the
American People.

560
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:01,364
It gives off
a better vibe.

561
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:02,399
What can I do
for you?

562
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:05,302
We'll explain inside.

563
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,241
Make yourselves comfortable,
I'll get some coffee.

564
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:12,476
Decaf if you've
got it, please.

565
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:14,644
Me, too.

566
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,580
Caffeine is a drug,
you know.

567
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:19,282
Same carbon ring
structure as cocaine.

568
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:22,586
We learned that in my
political biochem course.

569
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:31,128
We'd like to start with
a few routine questions.

570
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,663
Okay, I guess.

571
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:37,601
Do you regularly use any illegal
or controlled substances?

572
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:39,569
Are you the father of any
children out of wedlock,

573
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,639
particularly of a racial
group other than Caucasian?

574
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,675
And lastly, do you
believe in God?

575
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:49,446
No, no,
and I'm not sure.

576
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:50,580
Is that it?

577
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,249
That's just for
our database.

578
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:53,517
What we really need is a
statement regarding someone

579
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:54,718
you know.

580
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,520
A statement?

581
00:35:56,522 --> 00:36:01,124
Actually, a kind of summary
of his political beliefs.

582
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:03,193
I don't know what friend
you're talking about.

583
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:04,661
All my friends
live in Berkeley.

584
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:08,365
The one who moved to
Los Angeles, Nicholas Brady.

585
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:12,602
You'll find the instructions
and forms in this kit.

586
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,709
And, needless to say, it's
absolutely inappropriate

587
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:23,547
to share any of
this with Mr. Brady.

588
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:36,493
Through various signs and clues,
Nick came to believe that on

589
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:40,297
some level he might still
be living in ancient Rome,

590
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:42,599
an early Christian in
the time of martyrdom,

591
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:45,769
that the true year
was around 70 A.D.,

592
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:49,739
that the Roman empire
had never ended.

593
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,612
Here was Nick's
strangest vision yet.

594
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:59,516
He was locked up in a cage,
but it wasn't him, exactly.

595
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:01,651
He was some kind
of small, mammal

596
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:05,322
and Richard F. Fremont
was our Nero.

597
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,692
A blood thirsty
dragon took off

598
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:12,562
and began to descend
towards him.

599
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,664
I didn't need to see a weird
reptile rip my friend apart

600
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:17,534
to know he was
in danger.

601
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:20,704
I would try to make
friends with the enemy

602
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:24,507
and disarm them with
the truth.

603
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,420
I've been working late.

604
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,623
You want to join me
in a glass of wine?

605
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,791
It's Alexander
Valley Vineyards.

606
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:44,194
It's new, but it's
really good.

607
00:37:44,196 --> 00:37:46,563
Maybe just a taste.

608
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,769
Do you usually work
by candlelight?

609
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,672
Do you usually
dress like that?

610
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:58,742
You know I was wondering why
you invited me over here.

611
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:01,711
Friends of the American People
doesn't encourage its cadres

612
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:06,283
to socialize with
their clients.

613
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,455
You know, I need help
with the statement.

614
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,357
I'm not sure what to put
down, what to leave out.

615
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,359
Don't leave
anything out.

616
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:17,627
I think it's because
I know so much about Nick

617
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:21,464
that I'm having trouble.

618
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,366
You can do it.

619
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:24,701
You're
a professional writer.

620
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,703
Yeah, but I write
science fiction.

621
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:28,705
I'm used to
making stuff up.

622
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:31,541
Well, you can't make up anything
on these reports, Phil.

623
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:33,410
They're sworn statements.

624
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:35,478
Nick talks to God.
What?

625
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,716
Or God talks to Nick, depending
on how you want to look at it.

626
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:42,585
You're sure he's
not just crazy?

627
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:44,788
You should be
writing this down.

628
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,557
I'm going to reveal some of
the things God told him.

629
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,292
Who cares?

630
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:50,794
I can't report
stuff like that.

631
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:54,030
Some of it might be useful
to the government.

632
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,636
You got me over
here for this?

633
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:03,440
There's nothing we can do
about a religious thing.

634
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,778
Maybe, it's not the only
reason I invited you over.

635
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,590
There must be something else
about Brady that could offset

636
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,726
all this weird
stuff about God.

637
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:24,627
How can you
offset God?

638
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:28,765
He's all-knowing
and all-powerful.

639
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:33,036
I mean in terms
of political views.

640
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:36,139
Want more wine?

641
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,776
I'd rather
smoke grass.

642
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:41,311
Sorry, I don't
have any.

643
00:39:41,313 --> 00:39:42,445
I do.

644
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:43,680
It's really
killer stuff.

645
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:45,582
I don't want drugs
in my house.

646
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:48,451
Grass doesn't count.

647
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:51,454
Really?

648
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:57,060
You afraid
I'm setting you up?

649
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,668
It's much more dangerous
for me than you.

650
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,339
FAPers are the straightest
kids on the planet.

651
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:10,807
That's why I was glad
when you called.

652
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:14,711
I knew you'd be
cool to smoke with.

653
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:19,082
Oh, yeah, why's that?

654
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:21,384
Everyone knows you're
a big pothead.

655
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:23,553
It's in the files.

656
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:31,027
Now, are we gonna
have sex or what?

657
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:34,464
Grass gets
me super horny.

658
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:58,054
So what do you do when
you're not working for FAP?

659
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:01,424
You can't do that kind of
work full-time, can you?

660
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:02,692
I'm in school.

661
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:04,027
Where at? UCLA?

662
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:05,595
Cal State?

663
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:07,030
Fairfax.

664
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:09,532
Fairfax as in
Fairfax High?

665
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:11,601
Yeah, I'm a senior.

666
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:13,069
How old are you?

667
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:14,070
17.

668
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:15,572
Jesus Christ!

669
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:17,674
Don't be such
a worrywart.

670
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:20,076
Get your stuff, you've
got to get out of here.

671
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,713
No one even
knows I'm here.

672
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:25,181
Except Ted, of course.

673
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:27,050
Who the hell is Ted?

674
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:29,118
The boy I came here
with this morning.

675
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,587
He's my partner.

676
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:32,555
We're sort of engaged.

677
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:36,426
I told him I'd call when I got
home so he'd know I'm all right.

678
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:38,094
You're not going tell
him we had sex are you?

679
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:39,562
Look, just file your
statement on time.

680
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:41,164
That's all
he cares about.

681
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,800
He's the most gung-ho
FAPer in the district.

682
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:48,104
I just enjoy meeting people
we're assigned to cover.

683
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:55,111
So that's
how FAP does it.

684
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:57,413
Compromise someone with an
underage girl who doesn't

685
00:41:57,415 --> 00:42:02,485
look it, then turn
them into a snitch.

686
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:05,588
We just want you to
keep an eye on Brady.

687
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,223
I won't do it.

688
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:10,593
We have a lot of information
on you, too, Phil.

689
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:14,130
I want to see your
driver's license.

690
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,769
Wait a minute, wait,
wait a minute...

691
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:23,706
You're not 17,
you're 23.

692
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,028
I'll be seeing
you soon, Phil.

693
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,429
Not if I can help it.

694
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:49,799
Oh, by the way, I hid
a small stash of coke.

695
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:51,367
You'll never find it.

696
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:53,236
Not even if you tear
the whole place apart.

697
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:56,139
Have fun!

698
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:15,191
I made an appointment
for you with the dentist.

699
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:17,794
God, I can't believe you still
have your wisdom teeth.

700
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:19,796
I can't believe how
much they hurt.

701
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:22,165
Well, he phoned in the
prescription for a pain killer.

702
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:27,136
The drugstore's delivering it
about an hour or so.

703
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:29,172
See ya.

704
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:31,541
Bye.

705
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,043
Mr. Brady?

706
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:08,111
Hey.

707
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:09,112
Hi.

708
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:10,146
What do I owe you?

709
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:12,248
10.42, please.

710
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:16,653
15.
Thank you.

711
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,523
What's that?

712
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:22,258
What's what?

713
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,762
Your, uh... necklace.

714
00:44:25,764 --> 00:44:27,730
Oh, the fish sign.

715
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:30,333
It's a symbol used by
the early Christians.

716
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,202
The Greek word for
fish is ichthys.

717
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:35,271
In Greek, the letters
are an acronym for

718
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:38,174
"Jesus Christ
God's Son Savior."

719
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:42,712
In the time of the Roman empire,
a time of persecution,

720
00:44:42,714 --> 00:44:45,515
they needed some way to
safely identify each other

721
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:48,751
and their
meeting places.

722
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:34,263
For many years we
have watched them.

723
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:37,300
Their terrible deeds
are known to us.

724
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:39,268
Soon, they shall
be judged,

725
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:44,173
and you will be an
instrument of that justice.

726
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:06,362
Have no fear,
Nicholas Brady.

727
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:11,367
You are a child of
the starry heavens.

728
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:14,036
Well, you're going to be
just fine, Mr. Brady.

729
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:16,205
We have you on a strong
antibiotic drip.

730
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:19,809
And you'll be able to get out
of here in a couple of hours.

731
00:46:19,811 --> 00:46:23,412
I saw great,
fiery pinwheels.

732
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:25,448
I felt like I was
going crazy.

733
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,383
I'm not surprised.

734
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:28,785
You've had a build-up
of toxins due

735
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:31,254
to that infected
wisdom tooth of yours.

736
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:35,158
But don't worry, you're
going to be just fine now.

737
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,361
What a relief.

738
00:46:38,363 --> 00:46:41,130
Those ridiculous religious
ideas and visions.

739
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,032
Imagine!

740
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:45,802
It was all just an
impacted wisdom tooth.

741
00:46:45,804 --> 00:46:47,303
Honey, I don't
want to argue.

742
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:48,704
Maybe I do have an
infected tooth...

743
00:46:48,706 --> 00:46:50,540
Maybe?

744
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:51,808
The doctor said that
was the reason why--
All right.

745
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,710
Yes, I have an
infected tooth.

746
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:57,046
And maybe I have toxins
in my bloodstream

747
00:46:57,048 --> 00:46:59,182
and maybe they caused the
blackout and hallucinations,

748
00:46:59,184 --> 00:47:01,651
but that doesn't explain the
hallucinations themselves,

749
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:03,186
does it?

750
00:47:03,188 --> 00:47:05,421
Hallucinations don't
need an explanation.

751
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:07,023
They're not supposed
to make sense.

752
00:47:07,025 --> 00:47:08,691
But mine do.

753
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:11,060
Mysteries have been
revealed to me.

754
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:14,363
Like the Kennedy
assassination.

755
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:19,168
And I suppose VALIS told you
who was behind the conspiracy.

756
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:52,461
The message could have come from
a parallel world where Portugal

757
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:56,098
rather than England
colonized America.

758
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,733
It sounds to me like whoever was
delivering the information must

759
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:59,769
have been pretty
low-level.

760
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:02,438
He might have been
in a trance state.

761
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,473
That would explain why he
didn't know his own name.

762
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:08,511
But why transmit
from a parallel world?

763
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:12,181
Maybe it's too dangerous
to contact you directly.

764
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:15,785
So you they transmit from
an alternate reality where

765
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:20,089
President Fremont hasn't
even been elected?

766
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:23,559
Sounds to me like a world
where he was never born.

767
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:25,761
Think about it.

768
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:29,165
If there had been any
Protestant Reformation,

769
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:32,435
the world might have divided up
between Portugal and Spain,

770
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:35,471
the major
Catholic powers.

771
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:39,342
It's odd thinking that science
in a more religious world

772
00:49:39,344 --> 00:49:41,510
would be
further advanced.

773
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:43,512
But it makes sense.

774
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:46,482
They never fought the terrible
sectarian wars that set

775
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:50,453
civilization back
five hundred years.

776
00:49:50,455 --> 00:49:53,322
Actually, a pretty interesting
premise for a novel.

777
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,358
Oh, hey, look, no, you gotta
promise me you won't write

778
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,492
about any
of this, man.

779
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:57,560
Not even fictionalized.

780
00:49:57,562 --> 00:49:59,128
Don't be paranoid.

781
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:01,330
I've already told FAP
you talk to God.

782
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,165
They couldn't
care less.

783
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,800
God's not on their
list of subversives.

784
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:06,502
Not yet.

785
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,372
I'm sure they're
looking into Him.

786
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,482
There's a woman
here to see you.

787
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:22,051
She doesn't have an appointment
and won't say what she wants.

788
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:24,520
Should I say
you're unavailable?

789
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:25,521
No, it's fine.

790
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:30,393
Send her in.

791
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:33,629
Hi, I am sorry to
barge in on you.

792
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:36,532
My name is
Sylvia Sadassa.

793
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:39,468
Hi.
Hi.

794
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,570
You're a singer-songwriter,
aren't you?

795
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:43,039
What gave
you that idea?

796
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,440
No.

797
00:50:44,442 --> 00:50:46,542
I'm here to apply
for a job.

798
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,612
Sorry, I-- I don't
do the hiring.

799
00:50:49,614 --> 00:50:51,547
Do you mind if I sit
down for a second?

800
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:55,551
Just getting
over an illness.

801
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:58,521
Are you okay?
Oh, yeah.

802
00:50:58,523 --> 00:51:02,324
I'm sorry, yeah, no,
I'm fine, thank you.

803
00:51:02,326 --> 00:51:05,361
Sorry.

804
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:10,399
What kind of guitar
do you have?

805
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,068
A Gibson.

806
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:15,404
But I don't play professionally,
though, why do you ask?

807
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:18,541
I just assumed that anyone
with a passion for the music

808
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:22,445
business must be
somewhat musical.

809
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:24,447
Do you write songs?

810
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:26,148
Just poetry.

811
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,117
But I do great
secretarial work.

812
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:31,787
I take shorthand and
I type 70 words per minute.

813
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:38,094
I'll make sure
personnel sees you.

814
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:42,264
But we get hundreds of
applications every month.

815
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:46,202
If you get any kind of job
here, it'll be a miracle.

816
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:52,141
I guess this proves VALIS
isn't infallible, huh?

817
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:53,576
You can't give a recording
contract to a secretary,

818
00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:55,411
can you?

819
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:58,581
It's amazing how much
of the dream was true.

820
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:01,517
Maybe she just needs
a little encouragement.

821
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:03,486
Don't we all?

822
00:52:03,488 --> 00:52:05,154
Here's the weirdest part.

823
00:52:05,156 --> 00:52:07,423
I looked at her resume.

824
00:52:07,425 --> 00:52:10,593
She's divorced, but still uses
her ex-husband's last name.

825
00:52:10,595 --> 00:52:12,695
But you'll never guess
her maiden name is.

826
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:14,463
What's that?

827
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,298
Aramchek.

828
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:20,669
Sylvia Aramchek.

829
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:22,605
Could be a coincidence.

830
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:24,106
She even grew up
in Placentia,

831
00:52:24,108 --> 00:52:26,575
it's the same town
as the President.

832
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,649
It's just a funny
coincidence.

833
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:37,286
I used to get asked about
my name all the time.

834
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:43,559
Actually, I have a small
confession that I want to make.

835
00:52:43,561 --> 00:52:47,263
What's that?

836
00:52:47,265 --> 00:52:52,201
"Sadassa" isn't my real name,
I've never been married.

837
00:52:52,203 --> 00:52:54,470
But President Fremont made
it impossible for me to live

838
00:52:54,472 --> 00:52:56,505
with the name
"Aramchek."

839
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,607
You can understand
that, right?

840
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:02,745
One night a friend and I found
the name "Aramchek" written in

841
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:06,682
the cement right behind the
house where Fremont was born.

842
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:10,619
Yeah, I know, my grandfather did
that when he was a teenager.

843
00:53:10,621 --> 00:53:14,456
So why Progressive Records,
why'd you come to us?

844
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:16,625
Well, you have
got good artists.

845
00:53:16,627 --> 00:53:19,161
It just seemed more exciting
than working for a lawyer

846
00:53:19,163 --> 00:53:22,631
or an oil company.

847
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:25,668
I want to sign you to
a recording contract.

848
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:26,669
You've got to be
kidding me.

849
00:53:26,671 --> 00:53:27,703
Doing what?

850
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,638
Singing.

851
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,774
You have a gorgeous
soprano voice.

852
00:53:31,776 --> 00:53:33,309
I've heard it.

853
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,543
You have?

854
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,179
Where?

855
00:53:37,181 --> 00:53:39,515
Something to drink?

856
00:53:39,517 --> 00:53:41,317
Glass of wine?

857
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:42,718
I wish I could.

858
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,654
Just a lemonade, thanks.

859
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:48,557
Club soda,
please, thanks.

860
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:52,561
You don't drink?

861
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:53,796
Not anymore, no.

862
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:55,698
It affects my eyesight.

863
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,733
When I was sick I would
sometimes go totally blind,

864
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:02,371
so I'd be bumping
into walls.

865
00:54:02,373 --> 00:54:04,707
If you don't mind my asking,
what was wrong with you?

866
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:06,275
Cancer.

867
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:08,711
Lymphoma.

868
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:10,379
The doctor said it's
unknown for anyone to have

869
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:13,549
it enter their
brain to survive.

870
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:17,353
He says if I live another year,
he'll have me written up.

871
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:19,655
Do the doctors know why
it went into remission?

872
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:21,557
Well, they never know.

873
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:23,492
But I think
it was prayer.

874
00:54:23,494 --> 00:54:27,696
Because when I was going
blind and I couldn't hear,

875
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:29,665
I was having seizures from
the medication.

876
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:34,403
I used to think it
was God healing me.

877
00:54:34,405 --> 00:54:36,739
You're an
extraordinary person.

878
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:39,475
Medically, maybe.

879
00:54:39,477 --> 00:54:43,479
Otherwise all I can do is
type and take dictation.

880
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,253
In Nick's vision
that night,

881
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:54,790
he was shown row after
row of fish tanks.

882
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,559
He was viewing all of this
from the vantage point

883
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:59,762
of a superior life form,

884
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:05,367
perhaps from the viewpoint
of VALIS itself.

885
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:08,404
Each of the fish tanks
was an alternate earth

886
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:12,641
in an alternate universe,
swarming with life.

887
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,745
Here was a good
universe he realized,

888
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:21,550
filled with happy creatures
living in harmony and beauty.

889
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:33,595
But there were also
other kinds of worlds,

890
00:55:33,597 --> 00:55:36,465
murky and frightening.

891
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,769
He suddenly realized that he
was now looking at how VALIS

892
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:43,806
saw our own reality.

893
00:55:43,808 --> 00:55:46,742
One of the worst.

894
00:55:46,744 --> 00:55:49,745
He was a small crab living at
the bottom, slyly concealed

895
00:55:49,747 --> 00:55:53,482
behind a boulder,
alone and frightened,

896
00:55:53,484 --> 00:55:57,753
afraid to venture forth,
until he saw its glow.

897
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:03,158
Daddy! Daddy!

898
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:05,761
What's up, buddy?

899
00:56:05,763 --> 00:56:08,664
I'm thirsty, Daddy.

900
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,677
Here you go.

901
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:27,716
I'm not hungry.

902
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:30,786
It's a game, just try
and have a bite.

903
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:45,701
Your secret name
is Paul.

904
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:50,472
Can you remember
that name? Paul.

905
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,811
Such a good boy.

906
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,114
To them, Earth is
like an unlit button

907
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:02,818
on the intergalactic
switchboard.

908
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:06,422
It's out of contact,
it's lost in the dark.

909
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:08,390
And now it's like
an emergency 9-1-1

910
00:57:08,392 --> 00:57:12,494
call has finally
gotten through.

911
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:14,363
But gotten
through to who?

912
00:57:14,365 --> 00:57:16,565
Aliens or God?

913
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:19,168
That's a tough
question.

914
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:22,070
Maybe the
answer is both.

915
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:24,106
Maybe the God of
the Old Testament,

916
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:26,708
the God who spoke to
Abraham and Moses.

917
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:31,113
Maybe he was
an alien.

918
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,182
You're kidding around, but an
advanced life form would seem

919
00:57:33,184 --> 00:57:37,686
like God to an ancient
tribe of nomads.

920
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:41,123
Nomads wandering
in the desert,

921
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:43,859
because the transmissions
are clearer.

922
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:51,767
I think VALIS has always been
there, ready to help mankind,

923
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:54,536
inspiring all
the great prophets,

924
00:57:54,538 --> 00:57:59,808
Moses, Confucius,
Buddha, Jesus.

925
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:03,645
Maybe even some of the
poets like William Blake.

926
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,647
And now you?

927
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:07,749
The next avatar?

928
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:11,086
The second coming?

929
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:47,456
Behold the mother
of Sylvia Sadassa.

930
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:04,032
Her mother's name
is Aramchek.

931
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:07,102
Whose mother?

932
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:09,204
Sylvia Sadassa.

933
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:11,173
A woman we just
hired at work.

934
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:16,211
In my vision, she was signing
up young Richard Fremont

935
01:00:16,213 --> 01:00:19,147
for something, but
signing him up for what?

936
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:22,284
She used a red
fountain pen.

937
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:23,585
Red.

938
01:00:23,587 --> 01:00:26,288
Subversive.

939
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:31,059
Signed up.

940
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:33,295
Okay, okay,
I get it.

941
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:36,031
It's clear, economical,
direct.

942
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:38,133
It's like
a political cartoon.
What is?

943
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:41,637
The scene I witnessed, it
symbolizes something that

944
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:44,139
happened to Richard Fremont
in his late teens.

945
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:47,175
The Fremonts and the Aramcheks
lived on the same block, right?

946
01:00:47,177 --> 01:00:50,545
Mrs. Aramchek was an organizer
for the Communist Party.

947
01:00:50,547 --> 01:00:53,649
She must have
recruited him back then.

948
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,793
But Fremont's not
a communist.

949
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:06,194
He's a fascist.

950
01:01:06,196 --> 01:01:08,030
We get hung up
on names and labels,

951
01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:09,698
they don't
mean anything.

952
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:12,701
The communists really are all
fascists and Fremont the fascist

953
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:15,203
is the first communist president
of the United States.

954
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:16,772
It makes perfect
sense to me.

955
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:18,440
This is too farfetched.

956
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:21,343
Richard Fremont, America's
most famous red-baiter,

957
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,045
a secret communist?

958
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:24,713
Yes!

959
01:01:24,715 --> 01:01:27,649
I'm sure he started out as
just another youthful idealist.

960
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:29,718
But little Dickie turned
out to be exactly what

961
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,254
Mrs. Aramchek
was looking for,

962
01:01:32,256 --> 01:01:33,722
a sleeper agent who
could someday rise

963
01:01:33,724 --> 01:01:36,258
to high political
office.

964
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,627
Why would the Soviets and
America's right-wing both

965
01:01:38,629 --> 01:01:40,762
back the same man?
It doesn't make sense.

966
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:42,731
And by the way, we won
the Cold War, didn't we?

967
01:01:42,733 --> 01:01:45,634
Yeah, that's what Fremont and
the Russian puppet regime

968
01:01:45,636 --> 01:01:47,402
want us to think.

969
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:49,738
But what's the difference
between the right-wing cops

970
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,106
in the United States,

971
01:01:51,108 --> 01:01:52,774
and the left-wing
cops in Russia?

972
01:01:52,776 --> 01:01:56,611
The KGB, the CIA, FAP, they're
all just different aspects

973
01:01:56,613 --> 01:01:59,314
of the same security
state apparatus.

974
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:02,784
Why reveal this kind of
top-secret information to you?

975
01:02:02,786 --> 01:02:05,287
Somehow I must be in the right
position to do something

976
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:08,090
with the information.

977
01:02:08,092 --> 01:02:10,258
I gotta admit, it would be
pretty fucking fascinating

978
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,294
if it's true.

979
01:02:12,296 --> 01:02:15,330
The assassination of JFK and
both his brothers, supposedly

980
01:02:15,332 --> 01:02:19,201
by disaffected loners,
was to get Fremont elected.

981
01:02:19,203 --> 01:02:21,103
It was the only way.

982
01:02:21,105 --> 01:02:22,738
And to make sure he stays in
power, Fremont's rich cronies

983
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,307
went around and bought control
of all the biggest voting

984
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:27,743
machine manufacturers.

985
01:02:27,745 --> 01:02:30,112
No wonder a guy almost no
one likes continues to win

986
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:34,216
the Presidency by the largest
margins in history.

987
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,325
How's it going?

988
01:02:43,327 --> 01:02:45,360
Great.

989
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:50,065
Thank you again for
helping me get this job.

990
01:02:50,067 --> 01:02:54,169
I had a feeling you
belonged here.

991
01:02:54,171 --> 01:02:56,238
It's funny you
should say that.

992
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,307
I had a dream about this
record company last night.

993
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:01,710
I was at a recording session
and I remember thinking how

994
01:03:01,712 --> 01:03:04,212
wonderful
the singer was.

995
01:03:04,214 --> 01:03:09,785
And when I picked up the album
cover, I realized it was me.

996
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:13,188
I'm interested
in dreams.

997
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:16,324
Have you had any other
strange ones lately?

998
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:22,297
The truth is I came
here because of a dream.

999
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:24,633
I was in this beautiful green
valley and I was walking toward

1000
01:03:24,635 --> 01:03:30,438
this mountain and it
turns into a building.

1001
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,407
It had a plaque
on the entrance

1002
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:35,677
way and it said
PROGRESSIVE on it.

1003
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:40,348
And I could hear this incredibly
sweet music coming from inside.

1004
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:44,352
I was worried that
you wouldn't show up.

1005
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:56,164
Mr. Brady, your
wife just phoned.

1006
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,799
She says its urgent you
get a copy of the Times

1007
01:03:57,801 --> 01:04:00,235
and look at page three.

1008
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,376
According to the official
Russian news agency,

1009
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:11,246
a respected Moscow
astrophysicist has reported

1010
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:13,748
the discovery of unexplained
radio signals from what

1011
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:17,419
he believes may be an
extraterrestrial source.

1012
01:04:17,421 --> 01:04:20,388
Professor Georgi Moyashki
has detected short,

1013
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:23,258
information-rich signals
as the source passes over

1014
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:25,093
Earth's night side.

1015
01:04:25,095 --> 01:04:27,162
The U.S. Space Agency
has already gone on record

1016
01:04:27,164 --> 01:04:29,397
stating that the signals
most likely originate

1017
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:32,500
from an abandoned and
forgotten earth satellite.

1018
01:04:32,502 --> 01:04:35,237
Russian authorities have
announced plans to deploy

1019
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:38,240
a space probe to photograph
the mysterious transmitter.

1020
01:04:38,242 --> 01:04:43,245
Meanwhile, earlier
today on the I-5--

1021
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:50,452
Intense high-frequency bursts;
always at night.

1022
01:04:50,454 --> 01:04:54,356
Don't you receive your images,
your voices, at 3:00 a.m.?

1023
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:55,824
It fits!

1024
01:04:55,826 --> 01:04:58,426
You're not crazy.

1025
01:04:58,428 --> 01:05:01,396
I never thought I was.

1026
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:03,298
You and Phil were
talking that it could be

1027
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,432
a satellite
orbiting Earth.

1028
01:05:04,434 --> 01:05:06,167
Right?

1029
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:07,435
I remember you
saying that.

1030
01:05:07,437 --> 01:05:09,304
That was months ago.

1031
01:05:09,306 --> 01:05:11,373
You know how I am
with theories.

1032
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:14,409
Like planes landing at LAX,
a new one every few minutes.

1033
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,444
Our latest theory is that the
messages come from a parallel

1034
01:05:16,446 --> 01:05:19,381
universe.
Who cares about
your theories?

1035
01:05:19,383 --> 01:05:22,450
This is real.

1036
01:05:28,492 --> 01:05:31,259
♪ Every day

1037
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:37,766
♪ Seems to be the door
at someone's reach ♪

1038
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:39,567
For years, Nick
had placed his faith

1039
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:42,470
in the instructions
of VALIS.

1040
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:47,208
Moving to LA, going to work
for Progressive Records.

1041
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:49,344
He thought of VALIS
as all-knowing,

1042
01:05:49,346 --> 01:05:52,180
a manifestation
of God's will.

1043
01:05:52,182 --> 01:05:56,451
If VALIS was just a satellite,
it reduced something limitless

1044
01:05:56,453 --> 01:06:00,055
to a finite reality,
a mere machine.

1045
01:06:00,057 --> 01:06:02,424
♪ Every day
the satellite... ♪♪

1046
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:19,274
Breathe deeply.

1047
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:52,240
Did you think we
would forsake you?

1048
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:54,509
Is your belief
so weak?

1049
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:56,077
Where am I?

1050
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,512
A place above the stars.

1051
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:01,082
This is where you
were truly born.

1052
01:07:01,084 --> 01:07:02,617
I come from
above the stars?

1053
01:07:02,619 --> 01:07:04,519
Many times.

1054
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:07,555
Only now are you remembering
who you really are.

1055
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:09,090
Who am I?

1056
01:07:09,092 --> 01:07:10,558
Everyone.

1057
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,260
And all things.

1058
01:07:12,262 --> 01:07:14,496
You asked to be broken
down and healed.

1059
01:07:14,498 --> 01:07:17,565
This is that breaking
down and healing.

1060
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:20,568
Soon you shall be
with us for all time.

1061
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:23,638
I'm not going to die?
I won't cease to exist?

1062
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:27,609
No one truly dies
and nothing is ever lost.

1063
01:07:27,611 --> 01:07:30,178
There is nowhere
for anything to go.

1064
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:34,516
There is only here
and now, for all time.

1065
01:07:34,518 --> 01:07:39,220
Now that you have remembered,
there can be no forgetting.

1066
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,089
Nick.

1067
01:07:41,091 --> 01:07:45,427
You are a lucky man.

1068
01:07:45,429 --> 01:07:47,429
I don't feel so lucky.

1069
01:07:47,431 --> 01:07:49,397
I've got the world's worst
headache in the world.

1070
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,466
I'm not surprised,
you've been through a lot.

1071
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:54,402
Let's take a look.

1072
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:57,672
The steering wheel did
most of the damage.

1073
01:07:57,674 --> 01:08:00,408
I'm afraid you're going
to be with us for a while.

1074
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:02,577
This kind of trauma...

1075
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,479
What the--?

1076
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:06,214
Is something wrong?

1077
01:08:06,216 --> 01:08:07,649
Just a minute.

1078
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:11,419
Wow, your skin's hot.

1079
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:15,490
Is this tender?

1080
01:08:15,492 --> 01:08:18,126
No.

1081
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:27,635
Look, I'm glad you're all
right, but how is it possible?

1082
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:30,472
The satellite
healed me.

1083
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:38,113
There's something else
I've got to tell you.

1084
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:41,282
The new secretary
at work, Sylvia.

1085
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:44,319
She's part of
all this, too.

1086
01:08:44,321 --> 01:08:46,688
Are you sure you
can trust her?

1087
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:49,324
I don't know,
I think so.

1088
01:08:49,326 --> 01:08:51,626
I'm still just
finding my way here.

1089
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:55,363
There's no real chance of
overthrowing Fremont, is there?

1090
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:57,332
Probably not.

1091
01:08:57,334 --> 01:08:58,700
But it's still
worth trying.

1092
01:08:58,702 --> 01:09:00,335
Yeah.

1093
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:02,437
And what if it
ruins our lives?

1094
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:04,739
And our son's life?

1095
01:09:04,741 --> 01:09:08,676
My friendship with Phil,
writer of pulp science fiction

1096
01:09:08,678 --> 01:09:12,480
stories is a false lead.

1097
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:14,315
The authorities are looking for
something subversive to show up

1098
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:16,317
in his books.

1099
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,186
But the fact is we have a
better chance to get a message

1100
01:09:18,188 --> 01:09:20,321
out in a song.

1101
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:23,758
If we're caught they'll
put us in prison or kill us,

1102
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,494
so I'm making this videotape
for you, Ezra,

1103
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:29,397
so that one day, you'll
know the truth....

1104
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:32,133
Mr. Brady.

1105
01:09:32,135 --> 01:09:33,535
Is something wrong?

1106
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:35,336
I know about
your mother.

1107
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:37,739
What do you mean? What are
you doing here so late?

1108
01:09:37,741 --> 01:09:41,709
I know she was a recruiter for
the Communist Party and I know

1109
01:09:41,711 --> 01:09:45,313
she signed up
Richard Fremont.

1110
01:09:45,315 --> 01:09:46,414
I heard about your
car crash.

1111
01:09:46,416 --> 01:09:47,749
Are you all right?

1112
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:49,684
You're talking
crazy right now.

1113
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:51,653
Fremont and the Party think
their secret is safe.

1114
01:09:51,655 --> 01:09:55,657
But as a little girl, you must
have overheard conversations.

1115
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:57,392
You're the only person
outside the highest ranks

1116
01:09:57,394 --> 01:09:59,194
of the Party who knows.

1117
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:01,229
That's why the government
tried to kill you with cancer,

1118
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:02,530
isn't it?
Why on earth would the
government want to harm me?

1119
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:03,731
I'm nobody.

1120
01:10:03,733 --> 01:10:06,668
We're supposed to
work together.

1121
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:10,171
Fremont's secret will go
out as a song in the form

1122
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:11,673
of a subliminal message.

1123
01:10:11,675 --> 01:10:14,242
I'll make sure that it saturates
the airwaves before the

1124
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:15,710
authorities get wise--
Listen to me.

1125
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:16,711
My mother has been a
down-to-earth Republican

1126
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,780
all her life.

1127
01:10:18,782 --> 01:10:20,615
She's just an ordinary woman
saddled with the name

1128
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:22,650
"Aramchek."

1129
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:24,652
The police have investigated her
over and over because of it

1130
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:26,721
and it's lunatic stuff like
this that gets innocent people

1131
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:29,657
into trouble.

1132
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:38,700
Your friend
Silvia called.

1133
01:10:38,702 --> 01:10:41,769
What did she say?

1134
01:10:41,771 --> 01:10:43,705
She's at
the La Paz Bar.

1135
01:10:43,707 --> 01:10:46,407
She wants you to
meet her there.

1136
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,434
I'm sorry if what I said before
offended you, I didn't--

1137
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:14,736
No, it's okay.

1138
01:11:14,738 --> 01:11:17,772
I had now idea how
I was supposed to react.

1139
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:20,708
I think
I'm being watched.

1140
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:24,712
I've received a new transmission
since I last saw you

1141
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:27,548
and I'm to initiate you further
into the organization by--

1142
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:28,716
Org--

1143
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:31,586
Organization?

1144
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:33,588
Aramchek.

1145
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:35,590
Aramchek really exists?

1146
01:11:35,592 --> 01:11:37,558
Sure.

1147
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,460
Why would Fremont waste
his time trying to stamp out

1148
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,296
an imaginary group?

1149
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:45,600
So what I said about
your mother is true?

1150
01:11:45,602 --> 01:11:48,569
Basically, yeah.

1151
01:11:48,571 --> 01:11:50,605
So what is Aramchek?

1152
01:11:50,607 --> 01:11:52,740
It's the people contacted by
the satellite, which in turn

1153
01:11:52,742 --> 01:11:57,278
receives instructions from a
star system called Albemuth.

1154
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,315
Life on this planet came
from there originally.

1155
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:02,784
So whenever we fall into
overwhelming difficulties,

1156
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:07,588
the satellite serves as our
link back to Albemuth.

1157
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:10,425
I think I intuited
most of this already.

1158
01:12:10,427 --> 01:12:12,827
Yeah, Aramchek includes
hundreds, maybe thousands

1159
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:17,632
of people, mostly here and in
the former Soviet Union.

1160
01:12:17,634 --> 01:12:19,133
We're each contacted
individually, so only

1161
01:12:19,135 --> 01:12:21,502
the satellite knows
who, and how many,

1162
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:25,473
where and exactly what
we're supposed to do.

1163
01:12:25,475 --> 01:12:26,641
Last call.

1164
01:12:26,643 --> 01:12:27,742
What would you like?

1165
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:30,278
Something strong.

1166
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:33,815
But I guess I'll
settle for club soda.

1167
01:12:33,817 --> 01:12:35,516
Make that two.

1168
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:38,519
Thanks.

1169
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:41,689
VALIS has done it before,
in the time of Jesus

1170
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:44,058
and the early
Christians.

1171
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,661
It didn't quite
work out then.

1172
01:12:46,663 --> 01:12:50,498
I always thought I made up
that word, VALIS.

1173
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:53,067
That word was
placed in your mind.

1174
01:12:53,069 --> 01:12:57,805
VALIS is how we all refer to it
while we assimilate the shock.
Shock?

1175
01:12:57,807 --> 01:13:00,775
Yeah, the shock of discovering
your mind is being invaded by

1176
01:13:00,777 --> 01:13:03,511
an alien life form.

1177
01:13:03,513 --> 01:13:07,315
It conjures up horrible images
of Martian insects knocking

1178
01:13:07,317 --> 01:13:10,051
over the Golden
Gate Bridge.

1179
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:12,653
But this invasion is
for our benefit, Nick.

1180
01:13:12,655 --> 01:13:17,058
You and I and the others
were chosen by VALIS.

1181
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:25,066
Will they leave after
Fremont is destroyed?

1182
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:27,435
If we manage
to destroy him.

1183
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:29,070
They're our
protectors, Nick.

1184
01:13:29,072 --> 01:13:31,105
They only come when
we need them.

1185
01:13:31,107 --> 01:13:34,142
I had to see
her for myself.

1186
01:13:34,144 --> 01:13:36,811
Has he shown you
pictures of our son?

1187
01:13:36,813 --> 01:13:40,415
I'm so sorry about
this, Mrs. Brady.

1188
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:41,816
You're going home.

1189
01:13:41,818 --> 01:13:44,519
Come on.

1190
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:53,528
I need you to go home.

1191
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:55,630
I'll explain everything to you
later, but you have to trust me.

1192
01:13:55,632 --> 01:13:57,765
What are you doing to us?
I thought we were happy.

1193
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:00,568
It's not what
you think.

1194
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:02,036
I don't know,
maybe it's worse.

1195
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:04,172
Are you in love with her?

1196
01:14:04,174 --> 01:14:07,708
Rachel, you are the only
woman I've ever loved.

1197
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:09,610
The only woman
I'm ever going to love.

1198
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,446
Then what are
you doing?

1199
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:13,815
You have to trust me.

1200
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,642
She doesn't understand.

1201
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:43,644
Did you really
expect her to?

1202
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:45,446
Do you expect anyone
to understand this?

1203
01:14:45,448 --> 01:14:48,649
I hoped she would.

1204
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:52,820
My crazy friend Phil
understands, sort of.

1205
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:54,589
Maybe you
should go home.

1206
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:57,058
No, this is more
important.

1207
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:58,759
Are you sure?

1208
01:14:58,761 --> 01:15:02,597
No, I'm not sure.

1209
01:15:02,599 --> 01:15:04,499
But I can't let my son grow up
a world like this if I can do

1210
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:07,101
something about it.

1211
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:11,439
Come here.

1212
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:22,149
The satellite's been up there
for thousands of years.

1213
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:23,784
What the ancient
Hebrews were to Egypt

1214
01:15:23,786 --> 01:15:25,419
and the early Christians
were to Rome,

1215
01:15:25,421 --> 01:15:28,623
we are now to this corrupt
new American empire.

1216
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:30,791
It's an ancient
fight, Nick.

1217
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:32,527
The values of the individual
against the supremacy

1218
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:34,195
of the state.

1219
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:35,596
That's why the confession
kits, that's why

1220
01:15:35,598 --> 01:15:37,832
the growing
police supervision.

1221
01:15:37,834 --> 01:15:42,136
Over half the organization has
been discovered and eliminated.

1222
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:44,171
Aren't you afraid?

1223
01:15:44,173 --> 01:15:47,575
I would be if it weren't
for Fire Bright.

1224
01:15:47,577 --> 01:15:51,178
That's how I refer to the
plasmatic entity within me.

1225
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:54,148
It's like a little egg of
silver, cold, pale fire,

1226
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:57,752
glowing with life
just right up here.

1227
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:07,194
It's strange to have him inside
us, alive, yet unnoticed.

1228
01:16:07,196 --> 01:16:09,497
When we're killed
does he die, too?

1229
01:16:09,499 --> 01:16:12,066
When the body is
destroyed, he leaves.

1230
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:14,168
But they won't
desert us.

1231
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:15,836
So just as you and I have
housed and sheltered them,

1232
01:16:15,838 --> 01:16:19,507
they'll take us along with
them into eternity.

1233
01:16:19,509 --> 01:16:21,642
As a reward
for succeeding?

1234
01:16:21,644 --> 01:16:24,645
No, what they value
is the attempt.

1235
01:16:24,647 --> 01:16:27,481
Not the achievement
or the ultimate result.

1236
01:16:27,483 --> 01:16:31,085
They judge us by our intention,
by our hearts.

1237
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:44,599
This just
in from Moscow.

1238
01:16:44,601 --> 01:16:47,535
Russian authorities report that
an accidental explosion aboard

1239
01:16:47,537 --> 01:16:50,237
the intercept missile launched
to photograph an allegedly

1240
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:53,074
extra-terrestrial satellite
has destroyed both

1241
01:16:53,076 --> 01:16:55,042
the satellite
and the missile.

1242
01:16:55,044 --> 01:16:57,244
The cause of the
blast is unknown.

1243
01:16:57,246 --> 01:16:58,813
And now,
turning to.....

1244
01:16:58,815 --> 01:17:00,181
Must be a lot of partying
tonight in the Kremlin

1245
01:17:00,183 --> 01:17:01,582
and the White House.

1246
01:17:01,584 --> 01:17:03,718
Well, I'm glad.

1247
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,821
At least it's over
and done with.

1248
01:17:06,823 --> 01:17:08,756
It's not over.

1249
01:17:08,758 --> 01:17:11,659
And it's not
done with.

1250
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:20,201
With great pleasure I now
authorize Project Coliseum.

1251
01:17:20,203 --> 01:17:22,203
Our toughest laws yet in
the fight against terror

1252
01:17:22,205 --> 01:17:25,706
and subversion.

1253
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:44,725
Did you see
the news last night?

1254
01:17:44,727 --> 01:17:46,293
Yeah, well, when
you attack a tyranny,

1255
01:17:46,295 --> 01:17:48,362
you've got to expect
it to fight back.

1256
01:17:48,364 --> 01:17:50,131
We knew once they
pinpointed the location

1257
01:17:50,133 --> 01:17:52,233
that they would
destroy it.

1258
01:17:52,235 --> 01:17:54,068
Can another
satellite be sent?

1259
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:55,736
There's one already on
the way from Albemuth.

1260
01:17:55,738 --> 01:17:57,238
But even traveling
at the speed of light,

1261
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,607
it won't arrive for
hundreds of years.

1262
01:17:59,609 --> 01:18:01,709
That's not going
to do us any good.

1263
01:18:01,711 --> 01:18:03,244
It's hopeless.

1264
01:18:03,246 --> 01:18:06,147
It's not, I've written
down the material.

1265
01:18:06,149 --> 01:18:08,082
What material?
The lyrics.

1266
01:18:08,084 --> 01:18:11,786
Use it on an album you
expect to sell really well.

1267
01:18:11,788 --> 01:18:13,788
What's the message
supposed to be?

1268
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:15,322
Take a look, it reads
like nothing at all.

1269
01:18:15,324 --> 01:18:18,192
It's completely
innocuous.

1270
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:20,094
Do you know what
it really means?

1271
01:18:20,096 --> 01:18:22,129
Well, I heard the final
recorded version in a dream

1272
01:18:22,131 --> 01:18:24,265
and it goes something like,
"Come to the party."

1273
01:18:24,267 --> 01:18:26,767
And it sounds like
just a fun party song.

1274
01:18:26,769 --> 01:18:29,403
Then later the vocal line
goes, "Join the party."

1275
01:18:29,405 --> 01:18:32,373
And the singer then goes,
"Everybody join the party."

1276
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:35,776
And a subtrack goes,
"Is everybody at the party?

1277
01:18:35,778 --> 01:18:38,145
Is everybody present
at the party?"

1278
01:18:38,147 --> 01:18:39,447
Only if you
listen closely,

1279
01:18:39,449 --> 01:18:41,348
you can hear they're
actually singing,

1280
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:43,751
"Is everybody's
president at the party?"

1281
01:18:43,753 --> 01:18:45,453
No, okay, I get it.

1282
01:18:45,455 --> 01:18:48,122
It's like the-- the Beatles,
the "I Am the Walrus,"

1283
01:18:48,124 --> 01:18:49,290
"Smoke dope, smoke dope,
everybody smoke dope"

1284
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:51,325
in the backup track.
Right.

1285
01:18:51,327 --> 01:18:53,294
And enough repeated listenings,
and the word gets through,

1286
01:18:53,296 --> 01:18:56,197
the message
gets through.

1287
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:58,165
I mean, is that all
there is to it?

1288
01:18:58,167 --> 01:18:59,834
What a grand chick.

1289
01:18:59,836 --> 01:19:01,502
What?

1290
01:19:01,504 --> 01:19:03,370
"What a grand chick,"
that's part of the chorus.

1291
01:19:03,372 --> 01:19:05,306
Only the backup vocals change
from "what a grand chick"

1292
01:19:05,308 --> 01:19:08,642
to "Aramcheck."

1293
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:12,379
The Fisher Kings are in
the studio this afternoon.

1294
01:19:12,381 --> 01:19:15,382
They'd be perfect
for it.
Great.

1295
01:19:15,384 --> 01:19:16,484
Why don't you go on ahead?
The less we're seen

1296
01:19:16,486 --> 01:19:18,786
together right
now the better.

1297
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:36,237
♪ Welcome join
the party ♪

1298
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:39,807

everybody's present ♪

1299
01:19:39,809 --> 01:19:43,310

♪ Wait for love ♪♪

1302
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:56,357
I fucking hate
this song.

1303
01:19:56,359 --> 01:19:59,794
Dude, relax, "Let's Party"
is gonna go out as a single.

1304
01:19:59,796 --> 01:20:02,663
If it doesn't sell, it's not
gonna be on the album.

1305
01:20:02,665 --> 01:20:05,065
Well, it doesn't sound like
any of our other material.

1306
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:06,834
I know.

1307
01:20:06,836 --> 01:20:10,337
Your contract gives us
the right to pick material.

1308
01:20:10,339 --> 01:20:12,139
We've never done it before,
we're probably not gonna do

1309
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,808
it again.

1310
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:15,342
Let's just get this thing laid
down and get out of here, okay?

1311
01:20:15,344 --> 01:20:17,344
It's almost midnight.

1312
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:48,409
A young lady to see
you, Mr. Brady.

1313
01:20:48,411 --> 01:20:51,445
Um, send her in.

1314
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:56,584
Hello.

1315
01:20:56,586 --> 01:21:00,721
I'm Vivian Kaplan from
Friends of the American People.

1316
01:21:00,723 --> 01:21:03,524
How can I help you?

1317
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:07,328
We understand you have an
employee here by the name

1318
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:09,463
of Sylvia Aramchek.

1319
01:21:09,465 --> 01:21:11,765
As I'm sure you know, there's
also a subversive organization

1320
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:13,801
calling itself Aramchek.

1321
01:21:13,803 --> 01:21:16,136
Would you like to make
a voluntary statement

1322
01:21:16,138 --> 01:21:18,806
concerning this
coincidence?

1323
01:21:18,808 --> 01:21:20,774
The only thing I know about
Aramchek is that it's Sylvia

1324
01:21:20,776 --> 01:21:23,143
Sadassa's maiden name.

1325
01:21:23,145 --> 01:21:26,080
How did you happen
to hire Ms. Aramchek?

1326
01:21:26,082 --> 01:21:28,282
She came here
looking for a job.

1327
01:21:28,284 --> 01:21:31,785
I felt sorry for her because
of her recent bout with cancer.

1328
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:36,290
I'm sorry, I'm very busy.

1329
01:21:36,292 --> 01:21:39,526
Do I have to answer these
questions right now?

1330
01:21:39,528 --> 01:21:42,496
What's this new song you're
releasing by the Fisher Kings?

1331
01:21:42,498 --> 01:21:44,498
"Let's Party."

1332
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,166
Everybody at Progressive
is talking about it.

1333
01:21:46,168 --> 01:21:48,402
We think it's going
to be a surefire hit.

1334
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:50,471
We'd like a copy
to review.

1335
01:21:50,473 --> 01:21:53,340
It's not even
mastered yet.

1336
01:21:53,342 --> 01:21:56,410
A demo tape
would be fine.

1337
01:21:56,412 --> 01:22:00,381
You could probably
get a demo sooner.

1338
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,790
It's our opinion,
Mr. Brady,

1339
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:12,826
that you're having a sexual
affair with Ms. Aramchek.

1340
01:22:12,828 --> 01:22:17,298
Whether I am or not
my personal business.

1341
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,166
Would you be willing to write
a statement concerning

1342
01:22:19,168 --> 01:22:21,535
the political loyalty
of Ms. Aramchek?

1343
01:22:21,537 --> 01:22:24,071
I'm sorry, but mutual spying
by friend upon friend is

1344
01:22:24,073 --> 01:22:26,807
destroying the fabric
of our society.

1345
01:22:26,809 --> 01:22:28,342
You can write that
down in your little book

1346
01:22:28,344 --> 01:22:30,144
and put it in my file.

1347
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:33,113
When can we have
the demo tape?

1348
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:37,151
Sometime next week.

1349
01:22:37,153 --> 01:22:40,187
And it will be the
same as the master?

1350
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:43,190
Yeah, more or less.

1351
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,162
You know, "more or less"
really isn't good enough,

1352
01:22:48,164 --> 01:22:50,331
Mr. Brady.

1353
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:06,347
Are you going
somewhere?

1354
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:12,086
I'm leaving.

1355
01:23:12,088 --> 01:23:15,189
I want you to talk to our
lawyer in the morning.

1356
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:19,226
Are you asking
for a divorce?

1357
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:37,077
I think the house
is bugged.

1358
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:41,515
These are our
financial papers.

1359
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:44,618
I've signed over everything,
the house, the bank accounts,

1360
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:46,653
to you.

1361
01:23:46,655 --> 01:23:49,590
It's Sylvia, isn't it?

1362
01:23:49,592 --> 01:23:53,494
It's not Sylvia, it's what
we're trying to do together.

1363
01:23:53,496 --> 01:23:57,564
It could be dangerous, I don't
want it to affect you and Ezra.

1364
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:04,538
How could-- how could
anything you do not affect us?

1365
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,639
We love you.

1366
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:12,579
Remember that.

1367
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:16,650
I will, too.

1368
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:33,400
"Let's Party" is our
hottest upcoming release

1369
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:35,536
and they know we've got a lot
of time and effort invested

1370
01:24:35,538 --> 01:24:37,571
into it, stands to reason
that they're suspicious.

1371
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:39,440
But what if
it's a trap?

1372
01:24:39,442 --> 01:24:40,808
What if they just want
us to produce this thing

1373
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:42,509
as some hard evidence?
If they really knew

1374
01:24:42,511 --> 01:24:44,611
what we were up to, they
would just arrest us.

1375
01:24:44,613 --> 01:24:49,083
I think we need
to move forward.

1376
01:24:49,085 --> 01:24:52,219
Even if there's no chance of us
getting away when we get caught?

1377
01:24:52,221 --> 01:24:55,322
This project has been
building for years, Nick.

1378
01:24:55,324 --> 01:24:57,224
VALIS may no longer be here to
protect us, but within each of

1379
01:24:57,226 --> 01:25:02,262
us, there's a new life
that's eternal.

1380
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:05,666
Well, I'll give
that little FAP bitch

1381
01:25:05,668 --> 01:25:07,468
a copy of the demo
tape for now

1382
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:09,703
and then when we press the
record, I'll make some copies

1383
01:25:09,705 --> 01:25:12,539
made from a master minus
the subliminal material.

1384
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:14,308
That way,
if they break in,

1385
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:16,310
whatever they get will
match their tape

1386
01:25:16,312 --> 01:25:20,514
and then we'll start
shipping the real thing.

1387
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:24,651
Wish me luck.

1388
01:25:24,653 --> 01:25:26,553
I have an appointment with my
doctor this afternoon to see

1389
01:25:26,555 --> 01:25:30,457
if I'm still
in remission.

1390
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:17,171
Let me get
this straight.

1391
01:26:17,173 --> 01:26:18,705
A million people think they're
just listening to a dumb rock

1392
01:26:18,707 --> 01:26:22,676
song, but what they're
actually hearing is,

1393
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:25,345
"Fremont's a red,
Fremont's a red,

1394
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,514
better a dead
Fremont than a red."

1395
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:30,517
Something like that?

1396
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:32,686
Basically, yes.

1397
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:36,323
And when it sinks in,
an outraged citizenry marches

1398
01:26:36,325 --> 01:26:39,726
to the White House en masse and
overthrows the government.

1399
01:26:39,728 --> 01:26:42,262
Is that the sequence
of events?

1400
01:26:42,264 --> 01:26:45,432
It has to be done.

1401
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:52,206
Listen to me, it's not
too late for you.

1402
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:54,408
Go back to Berkeley.

1403
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:57,678
Put some distance between
yourself and this mess.

1404
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:04,685
What the hell.

1405
01:27:04,687 --> 01:27:09,356
If I'm going down, I'm going
down with people I love.

1406
01:27:09,358 --> 01:27:11,758
Press a million
copies of the record.

1407
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,628
Here's to subversion.

1408
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:17,831
Here's to Aramchek.

1409
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:20,634
To subversion.

1410
01:27:30,778 --> 01:27:32,813
You know what this
probably means, right?

1411
01:27:32,815 --> 01:27:35,382
Yeah.

1412
01:27:35,384 --> 01:27:36,683
That somebody else is going
to have to write the great

1413
01:27:36,685 --> 01:27:38,752
American science
fiction novel.

1427

You need to start
getting out more.

1428
01:28:34,777 --> 01:28:39,346
Only if I can meet the redhead
from the show "Dallas."

1429
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:44,451
Well, I'm not speeding.

1430
01:28:44,453 --> 01:28:47,087
What do you
think I did?

1431
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:59,800
Shit.

1432
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:02,836
Get out of the car!

1433
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:04,104
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1434
01:29:04,106 --> 01:29:05,639
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa!

1435
01:29:05,641 --> 01:29:06,840
Easy!

1436
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:08,608
Hey, hey.
Easy.

1437
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:11,845
Ow!

1438
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:14,781
What the fuck?

1439
01:29:14,783 --> 01:29:18,085
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

1440
01:30:21,682 --> 01:30:23,550
I'll be straight
with you guys.

1441
01:30:23,552 --> 01:30:24,785
We planted a recording
device to monitor

1442
01:30:24,787 --> 01:30:27,053
your conversation
at the club.

1443
01:30:27,055 --> 01:30:29,089
Orders have been given
for Progressive Records

1444
01:30:29,091 --> 01:30:32,058
to be closed and all
its assets seized.

1445
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:34,161
How insane.

1446
01:30:34,163 --> 01:30:36,797
A subliminal message that our
President is himself a secret

1447
01:30:36,799 --> 01:30:39,099
subversive agent?

1448
01:30:39,101 --> 01:30:41,735
I have nothing
to say.

1449
01:30:41,737 --> 01:30:45,439
I want an attorney.

1450
01:30:45,441 --> 01:30:47,073
Take him out
and shoot him.

1451
01:30:47,075 --> 01:30:49,075
He might be able to
tell us something more.

1452
01:30:49,077 --> 01:30:52,078
Nothing we don't
already know.

1453
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:57,818
Bring him back.

1454
01:30:57,820 --> 01:31:00,053
I'll tell you
everything he told me.

1455
01:31:00,055 --> 01:31:03,423
I'm sorry, the satellite's
already infected him.

1456
01:31:03,425 --> 01:31:05,459
But the satellite's
gone now.

1457
01:31:05,461 --> 01:31:07,427
An egg has been
laid in his head.

1458
01:31:07,429 --> 01:31:09,796
An alien egg.

1459
01:31:12,099 --> 01:31:14,534
Where are you
taking me?

1460
01:31:14,536 --> 01:31:17,137
We always kill them before
they have a chance to hatch.

1461
01:31:17,139 --> 01:31:18,805
This one, too?

1462
01:31:18,807 --> 01:31:21,608
Give me a few
moments with him.

1463
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:30,784
We intend to let you
go on living, Phil.

1464
01:31:32,587 --> 01:31:35,222
We'll even publish
books under your name.

1465
01:31:35,224 --> 01:31:37,557
I'm an American
citizen!

1466
01:31:37,559 --> 01:31:39,826
I have rights!

1467
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:43,129
In fact, they
already exist.

1468
01:31:43,131 --> 01:31:45,565
We've been having them written
for several years now.

1469
01:31:45,567 --> 01:31:48,068
Your style's
easy to imitate.

1470
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:49,736
I'd rather you
just shoot me.

1471
01:31:49,738 --> 01:31:52,205
The novels will be
published anyway.

1472
01:31:52,207 --> 01:31:57,644
Book by book, you'll evolve
to more conservative views.

1473
01:31:57,646 --> 01:31:59,779
Since you're getting older,
it won't be unexpected

1474
01:31:59,781 --> 01:32:02,549
for you to mellow out.

1475
01:32:04,485 --> 01:32:06,319
Let me talk to Nick
before you kill him.

1476
01:32:06,321 --> 01:32:09,623
Will you cooperate with the
publication of your new books?

1477
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:11,491
Interviews? Signings?

1478
01:32:11,493 --> 01:32:14,127
Sci-fi conventions?

1479
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:21,701
Hold up on Brady.

1480
01:32:21,703 --> 01:32:25,171
Take him to
a cell for now.

1481
01:32:27,642 --> 01:32:29,142
Code Five on Brady.

1482
01:32:29,144 --> 01:32:32,178
Was that a mistake?

1483
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:34,180
No, that's okay.

1484
01:32:34,182 --> 01:32:36,783
Thanks, anyway.

1485
01:32:39,487 --> 01:32:40,820
I'm sorry, Phil.

1486
01:32:40,822 --> 01:32:42,556
It's too late.

1487
01:32:42,558 --> 01:32:44,157
It's police policy not
to delay eliminating

1488
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:47,627
alien-controlled
subversives.

1489
01:34:17,585 --> 01:34:20,553
Open the bag.
Number two.

1490
01:34:20,555 --> 01:34:23,256
So you can see
for yourself.

1491
01:34:50,317 --> 01:34:53,286
Whiskey? Single malt.

1492
01:35:05,132 --> 01:35:07,734
I assume you stopped
the song from getting out.

1493
01:35:07,736 --> 01:35:12,272
We shut down the record company
before they'd duped the master.

1494
01:35:12,274 --> 01:35:16,342
We got all the subliminal
tracks, too.

1495
01:35:16,344 --> 01:35:19,245
"Join the Party!"

1496
01:35:22,416 --> 01:35:26,186
No, it's "Let's Party."

1497
01:35:26,188 --> 01:35:28,621
They sing "join
the party" later on.

1498
01:35:28,623 --> 01:35:32,792
"A grand chick saved me, put
back together my whole world."

1499
01:35:32,794 --> 01:35:37,197
And the background turns into
"Aramchek saves the world."

1500
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:39,365
A bit unsubtle,
don't you think?

1501
01:35:39,367 --> 01:35:40,800
It might have worked.

1502
01:35:40,802 --> 01:35:42,368
Oh, sure.

1503
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:46,306
"Is everybody
president at the party?"

1504
01:35:47,808 --> 01:35:51,411
We use subliminal techniques
too, but not so crudely.

1505
01:35:51,413 --> 01:35:54,314
And for different ends.

1506
01:35:54,316 --> 01:35:56,349
Want to see
your new book?

1507
01:35:56,351 --> 01:35:59,252
No thanks.

1508
01:36:01,689 --> 01:36:06,392
It's called
"The Mind-Screwers."

1509
01:36:11,799 --> 01:36:14,200
You should give
it a try.

1510
01:36:14,202 --> 01:36:18,104
It's about an invasion of
hideous space worms who work

1511
01:36:18,106 --> 01:36:21,841
their way into people's heads
and rape their minds.

1512
01:36:21,843 --> 01:36:24,110
Real subtle.

1513
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:25,845
I just came to tell you,
I'm sorry you didn't get to

1514
01:36:25,847 --> 01:36:28,848
talk to Nick Brady
before he died.

1515
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:30,717
If you want, you can
talk to the Aramchek woman

1516
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:33,353
he was conspiring with.

1517
01:36:33,355 --> 01:36:35,288
Do you know her?

1518
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:39,225
No, I never got
to meet her.

1519
01:36:39,227 --> 01:36:42,162
Are you going
to shoot her, too?

1520
01:37:01,382 --> 01:37:02,515
You're Phil.

1521
01:37:02,517 --> 01:37:04,117
Nick's friend, right?

1522
01:37:04,119 --> 01:37:06,286
The science-fiction writer.

1523
01:37:06,288 --> 01:37:07,420
Is he okay?

1524
01:37:07,422 --> 01:37:09,823
No, he isn't.

1525
01:37:09,825 --> 01:37:12,492
They shot him.

1526
01:37:12,494 --> 01:37:15,395
I see.

1527
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:18,498
And you're sure
it's true.

1528
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:22,135
They showed
me his body.

1529
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:27,407
I suppose I'm next.

1530
01:37:29,410 --> 01:37:32,412
No trial,
no investigation.

1531
01:37:32,414 --> 01:37:34,280
They're really
afraid of us.

1532
01:37:34,282 --> 01:37:37,417
That's right.

1533
01:37:37,419 --> 01:37:40,320
I don't think
they'll kill you.

1534
01:37:40,322 --> 01:37:41,621
They said they want
you to write crappy novels

1535
01:37:41,623 --> 01:37:45,058
for them full of
pro-government propaganda.

1536
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:47,293
The books are
already written.

1537
01:37:47,295 --> 01:37:49,095
It'll just be my
name on them.

1538
01:37:49,097 --> 01:37:50,797
That's good.

1539
01:37:50,799 --> 01:37:52,765
It means they
don't trust you.

1540
01:37:52,767 --> 01:37:55,768
It's when they trust
you that it's bad.

1541
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:59,339
It's the next worst thing
to being on their side.

1542
01:37:59,341 --> 01:38:02,275
I'm sorry for all this.

1543
01:38:03,811 --> 01:38:05,545
For what Nick
got you into.

1544
01:38:05,547 --> 01:38:08,481
It's okay.

1545
01:38:08,483 --> 01:38:10,817
We're immortal.

1546
01:38:10,819 --> 01:38:14,420
VALIS conferred that on us, and
it will on everyone, someday.

1547
01:38:14,422 --> 01:38:17,190
I don't feel
too bad, though.

1548
01:38:17,192 --> 01:38:20,193
I feel like we put
up a good fight.

1549
01:38:21,462 --> 01:38:24,397
Time's up.

1550
01:38:42,316 --> 01:38:45,184
Don't tell them how
lousy their novels are.

1551
01:38:45,186 --> 01:38:47,520
Let them find out
the hard way.

1552
01:38:54,495 --> 01:38:57,563
So that's how
it all came down.

1553
01:38:57,565 --> 01:38:58,831
My friend Nicholas Brady
had tried

1554
01:38:58,833 --> 01:39:02,502
to save the
world and failed.

1555
01:39:02,504 --> 01:39:06,339
And I found myself
in this place.

1556
01:39:06,341 --> 01:39:08,808
The dark night
of the soul.

1557
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:11,511
Alone and forgotten.

1558
01:39:11,513 --> 01:39:14,480
Scribbling furtively
on scraps of paper

1559
01:39:14,482 --> 01:39:17,550
that no one would ever
get a chance to read.

1560
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:31,831
So you used to
be a writer?

1561
01:39:31,833 --> 01:39:34,233
Yeah.

1562
01:39:36,503 --> 01:39:38,538
In a way, I still am.

1563
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:43,443
Were you a member
of Aramchek?

1564
01:39:43,445 --> 01:39:45,345
No.

1565
01:39:45,347 --> 01:39:47,280
Know anything
about it?

1566
01:39:47,282 --> 01:39:49,549
Some friends
of mine belonged.

1567
01:39:49,551 --> 01:39:52,218
Dead?

1568
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:54,554
Yeah.

1569
01:39:54,556 --> 01:39:56,456
So, what's
Aramchek teach?

1570
01:39:56,458 --> 01:39:59,559
Are they really diehard
communists?

1571
01:39:59,561 --> 01:40:01,561
No.

1572
01:40:01,563 --> 01:40:05,331
They think we shouldn't put
our faith in any human rulers.

1573
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:08,401
That there's a vast intelligence
above the stars, that guides us,

1574
01:40:08,403 --> 01:40:11,537
that's interested
in our welfare.

1575
01:40:11,539 --> 01:40:14,841
That sounds like
a religious idea.

1576
01:40:14,843 --> 01:40:19,145
I always thought Aramchek was
a revolutionary organization.

1577
01:40:19,147 --> 01:40:20,713
It's both.

1578
01:40:20,715 --> 01:40:24,484
A subversive organization guided
by a supreme higher power.

1579
01:40:28,088 --> 01:40:29,422
They think our loyalty
should be to the values

1580
01:40:29,424 --> 01:40:32,458
of that higher
entity alone.

1581
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:34,560
You believe that, too?

1582
01:40:34,562 --> 01:40:37,497
I didn't at first.

1583
01:40:37,499 --> 01:40:41,067
But now, maybe.

1584
01:40:41,069 --> 01:40:43,369
So this, supreme being,
does it tell

1585
01:40:43,371 --> 01:40:46,406
the Aramchek
people what to do?

1586
01:40:46,408 --> 01:40:48,408
They called it VALIS.

1587
01:40:48,410 --> 01:40:52,211
It spoke to them
in visions.

1588
01:40:52,213 --> 01:40:55,081
And will again, someday,
I believe that.

1589
01:40:56,316 --> 01:40:58,351
You're a strange guy.

1590
01:40:58,353 --> 01:40:59,719
You ever hear
its voice?

1591
01:40:59,721 --> 01:41:02,588
No.

1592
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:05,425
But I wish I had.

1593
01:41:19,473 --> 01:41:23,242
I've still got my printing
supplies hidden away.

1594
01:41:23,244 --> 01:41:25,244
I might be able to
run off some literature

1595
01:41:25,246 --> 01:41:27,613
for you and your
Aramchek friends.

1596
01:41:27,615 --> 01:41:30,450
You interested?

1597
01:41:30,452 --> 01:41:33,586
Yeah, very much.

1598
01:41:33,588 --> 01:41:36,622
First, I've got to get back
to my friend's wife and son,

1599
01:41:36,624 --> 01:41:40,493
make sure they're okay.

1600
01:41:40,495 --> 01:41:43,329
You think Aramchek
would take me?

1601
01:41:43,331 --> 01:41:45,631
I need help, I can't
get anywhere alone.

1602
01:41:45,633 --> 01:41:48,301
Sure.

1603
01:41:48,303 --> 01:41:51,270
Maybe they
have already.

1604
01:41:51,272 --> 01:41:53,639
I've never heard
any voices.

1605
01:41:53,641 --> 01:41:56,642
Your own voice
might be the voice.

1606
01:41:58,679 --> 01:42:02,315
How about that?

1607
01:42:02,317 --> 01:42:05,218
Nobody's ever said
that to me before.

1608
01:42:10,657 --> 01:42:12,692
You think believing
about a heavenly power

1609
01:42:12,694 --> 01:42:14,627
get them anywhere?

1610
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:16,596
Not in this world.

1611
01:42:16,598 --> 01:42:19,665
I've got to tell you something
you maybe don't want to hear.

1612
01:42:19,667 --> 01:42:21,634
I know you loved your friends
and maybe they are happy spirits

1613
01:42:21,636 --> 01:42:23,669
somewhere up in the sky,

1614
01:42:23,671 --> 01:42:27,306
but even if they are,
that's not good enough.

1615
01:42:27,308 --> 01:42:29,342
They gave their lives
for that belief.

1616
01:42:29,344 --> 01:42:32,211
What I'm saying is, it's got
to be something here first.

1617
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:39,652
This is where the suffering is,
this is where the injustice is.

1618
01:42:39,654 --> 01:42:41,721
This Valis or God or whatever
you want to call it,

1619
01:42:41,723 --> 01:42:44,457
has to do something
for us here.

1620
01:42:44,459 --> 01:42:47,360
Or what the
fuck good is it?

1621
01:42:54,568 --> 01:42:56,536
What's this I heard about
the Aramchek people having

1622
01:42:56,538 --> 01:43:00,339
a beautiful silver egg placed
in each of their foreheads?

1623
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:02,208
That's what
they believe.

1624
01:43:02,210 --> 01:43:04,677
My theory is it enters along the
optic nerve to the pineal gland

1625
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:07,680
by means of radiation beamed
down by the satellite.

1626
01:43:07,682 --> 01:43:09,749
The egg hatches when they die
and incorporates them into

1627
01:43:09,751 --> 01:43:13,753
the vast living entity
in the stratosphere.

1628
01:43:17,691 --> 01:43:19,592
I got a confession
to make.

1629
01:43:19,594 --> 01:43:22,361
I know a little more about
Aramchek than I admitted.

1630
01:43:22,363 --> 01:43:24,597
I used to be a preacher.

1631
01:43:24,599 --> 01:43:26,732
The beautiful silver egg
that guarantees immortality,

1632
01:43:26,734 --> 01:43:28,501
that's in
the Bible, Phil.

1633
01:43:28,503 --> 01:43:31,437
Jesus speaks about
it several times.

1634
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:34,207
The real meaning was known
only to his disciples.

1635
01:43:34,209 --> 01:43:36,342
But now it's
coming back.

1636
01:43:36,344 --> 01:43:37,543
Tell me more,
preacher.

1637
01:43:37,545 --> 01:43:39,378
I'm not
a preacher anymore.

1638
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:40,780
Religion is shit.

1639
01:43:40,782 --> 01:43:43,382
It's more honest work
being a plumber.

1640
01:43:43,384 --> 01:43:45,451
You believe what my friend said
is true and yet you still--

1641
01:43:45,453 --> 01:43:50,323
I still say the work has
to be done here on earth.

1642
01:43:50,325 --> 01:43:53,726
Let me ask you this--
where did Jesus do his work?

1643
01:43:53,728 --> 01:43:56,729
Where did he teach?

1644
01:43:58,799 --> 01:44:00,566
Hey, boss.

1645
01:44:00,568 --> 01:44:04,303
Can we take five?
It's hot out here.

1646
01:44:20,287 --> 01:44:22,755

watching us.

01:44:44,412 --> 01:44:46,712
Hey, it's cool,
he's not going anywhere.

1654
01:44:46,714 --> 01:44:50,449

eye on him.

They must have gotten another
record company to press it--

1658
01:45:01,062 --> 01:45:04,330
while Progressive was preparing
its version, other members of

1659
01:45:04,332 --> 01:45:08,334
Aramchek must have been
working on the song, too.

1660
01:45:08,336 --> 01:45:09,635
They made it.

1661
01:45:09,637 --> 01:45:11,504
It's out.

1662
01:45:11,506 --> 01:45:13,806
Do you know
what this means?

1663
01:45:13,808 --> 01:45:16,108
I never listen to that
rock and roll junk.

1664
01:45:16,110 --> 01:45:17,543
I used to have
a big record collection,

1665
01:45:17,545 --> 01:45:20,346
mostly classical
and jazz.

1666
01:45:20,348 --> 01:45:23,783
As far as I'm concerned, that
music's just for the kids.

1667
01:45:23,785 --> 01:45:25,685
Yeah.

1668
01:45:25,687 --> 01:45:28,654
That's right,
for the kids.

1669
01:45:28,656 --> 01:45:32,191
The music's for them.

1670
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:37,330
I guess it's gonna
be up to them now.

1671
01:45:47,542 --> 01:45:50,409
While we waited to finish our
sentences, I continued to work

1672
01:45:50,411 --> 01:45:54,413
on Nick's story, which turned
out to be my story, too.

1673
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:59,852
I wanted to chronicle the
origins of that faint flicker

1674
01:45:59,854 --> 01:46:03,723
of hope that would someday
burn out a cancerous regime,

1675
01:46:03,725 --> 01:46:06,092
the humble beginnings of a mass
movement of young people that

1676
01:46:06,094 --> 01:46:10,463
would eventually change
our country for the better.

1677
01:46:10,465 --> 01:46:13,666
Even if they found my
manuscript and destroyed it,

1678
01:46:13,668 --> 01:46:17,470
I would still have been the
first to bear witness.

1679
01:46:21,641 --> 01:46:24,777
