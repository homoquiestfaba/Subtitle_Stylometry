1
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,141
Bobby!

2
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,855
Bobby, are you in there with Amada?
Bobby!

3
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,316
-lt's Jumbo.
-l'll be out in a second, Jumbo.

4
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,609
You gotta come out.

5
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:18,072
There's chicks dancing naked right
in the bar, in the lobby. Unbelievable.

6
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,448
-We gotta go.
-What?

7
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,701
-Bob!
-We gotta go.

8
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,286
Oh, fuck, I forgot.

9
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,121
Bob!

10
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,791
Fucking animal.

11
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,712
I gotta ask Mr. Buzhayev
if we can take the night off.

12
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,630
I love you.

13
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:39,343
I'm gonna run across the street.
You meet me at the car, okay?

14
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,763
-Okay. Go.
-Amada...

15
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:47,143
...l'm the luckiest man on the planet.
If l died right now, I'd be happy.

16
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,162
Hey, Mr. Green,
thanks for hooking me up, man.

17
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,705
How are you?

18
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,582
-Hey, Bobby.
-Hey.

19
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,459
You got the best club in Brooklyn.

20
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,669
Just wait
till l take over Manhattan, baby.

21
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,839
Hey, do me a favor. Get them
a couple of drinks, all right?

22
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:36,233
Hey, baby, give me my purse.
I'm meeting the family tonight.

23
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,527
I don't want Coco paying
for his shit tonight.

24
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,322
Not after that little mix-up
we had last weekend, ladies.

25
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,531
-All right.
-Bye.

26
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,158
Bye, Amada. Good luck, girl.

27
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,878
Take it off! Take it off!

28
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,512
Hey, get the fuck down here!

29
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,681
Hey, you! Get the fuck down!

30
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,561
Calm down. Let's give them space.
Good looking out, Jumbo.

31
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,063
No problem, Bob.

32
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,440
Oh, what the fuck?!

33
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,234
-Don't strain yourself.
-You got it.

34
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,654
Looks like everything's under control.
I'll take my break.

35
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:22,863
I didn't do nothing!

36
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,241
You"re bleeding all over the place.
Go home.

37
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,493
-Freddie, take him home.
-l didn"t do nothing.

38
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,704
Go easy on them, Jumbo.

39
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,260
I'm going across the street to see
the boss. Bring my car around.

40
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:47,304
-You got it. l need you to come--
-Be right back.

41
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:57,440
Hi, Kalina. Look at you.

42
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:01,277
You wanna go with me to
the club, huh? Do a little dance?

43
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,407
-Hey, everybody!
-Hey, Bobby.

44
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,618
-Hey, Mr. Buzhayev, how are you?
-Look, she got the watch.

45
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,122
Oh, yeah, it's great. I told you.
He's the best.

46
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,291
-Yeah. Yeah.
-l know deals.

47
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,459
Digital.

48
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,254
Yeah, it's great. Hey, listen.
I gotta go do something tonight...

49
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,299
...but Freddie will watch the place,
make the night drop later.

50
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,260
Good. So how is my club doing?

51
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,803
-Everything's fine.
-Good.

52
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,931
For me? Just this one.

53
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,435
Amada tells me l put on 5 pounds
every time l come over here.

54
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,271
I'm telling you,
you guys are fattening me up.

55
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,815
-Good?
-Excellent.

56
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,443
Always. Real good. Excellent.

57
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,320
Listen, Bobby....

58
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:49,742
Next week you come by, we talk.
We talk about plans for you.

59
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,161
We like what you do
at the club very much.

60
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,330
-Yeah? All right.
-Yeah.

61
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,165
-Good.
-Something more?

62
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,128
More? I just said l can't eat it.
I can't even eat this.

63
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,005
I can't have another bite.

64
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,257
What are you doing to me?

65
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,885
No, no, no, Amada's waiting.
I have to go.

66
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,261
You"re too good to me.

67
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,680
Why do l deserve this?

68
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:16,185
-No, I gotta go.
-Where? Where you run off to?

69
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,200
It's my bike. Don"t!

70
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,173
-Keep being brave, okay?
-Thank you.

71
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,383
Thank you.

72
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,182
-Here comes the right. Watch the right.
-Catch.

73
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,102
-Keep-- Keep it up. Keep the guard--
-Careful.

74
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,312
-Sorry, babe. Keep--
-Joseph.

75
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,148
-All right, hey. Hey.
-Joseph.

76
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,441
-Hey, quit fooling around.
-Did he bag it?

77
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,278
No, he never did. His gun jammed,
so he started crying.

78
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,988
That's terrible. A nine-point?

79
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,615
-Joseph, come on.
-Pop's calling. Look...

80
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,993
...we'll go to Metropole,
cut loose a little.

81
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,494
-You got it.
-Come over here.

82
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,246
Gotcha.

83
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,083
Get your picture taken.
It's your big night.

84
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,335
-We took them already.
-The more, the better.

85
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,588
-Get your face out there.
-Stevie, come here.

86
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,007
The P.C. will see this in the magazine,
all right?

87
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,843
-All right.
-Get used to it, it"s good. Come on.

88
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,846
-Good.
-Thanks, chief.

89
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,432
Go over there to Mommy,
all right?

90
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,434
It's almost 1 1 .
Where's your brother?

91
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,353
If he comes at all, he'll come late, Pop.
You know him.

92
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,441
Baby.

93
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,443
There's cops all around.

94
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,572
-They're all fucking drunk anyways.
-Give me some.

95
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,618
-l'm nervous.
-Don't be nervous. They're harmless.

96
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,954
Jumbo came through.
It's good, right?

97
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,125
Yeah, it's good. Okay.

98
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,219
You coming?

99
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:17,848
Do we have to? I don't know if I can
fucking deal with them tonight.

100
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,143
Come on, honey. lt's your family.
You gotta support them.

101
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,062
Hey, remember
what I told you, right?

102
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,898
Nobody at the club knows about
my family. Not even Jumbo.

103
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,108
I know. Baby, I won"t
say anything. Come on.

104
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,570
Last thing l need is anybody
thinking l"m a fucking cop.

105
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,282
-Never happen, baby.
-l could be a cop.

106
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,993
-What do you have to do?
-Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

107
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:42,206
Freeze. All right, spread them.
Spread them. Move!

108
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,041
-Get him! Get him!
-Arrest her.

109
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,127
-Where you going?
-Just kidding, officers.

110
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,047
He must know someone
because l'm talking about--

111
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,882
Shit. Oh, shit, look at this.

112
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,885
Bobby. Bobby Grusinsky.
Is that you?

113
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,805
It's me, Russ De Keifer
from across Union Turnpike.

114
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,181
-How you doing?
-All right.

115
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,309
-Still bartending at that Russian joint?
-l'm managing it now.

116
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,019
Hey, listen to you.

117
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,939
-Did he just call you "Grusinsky"?
-l'll talk to you later.

118
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,107
That guy"s funny.

119
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,820
Oh, my God.

120
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,867
That's them.
In the corner down there.

121
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,373
Hey, Pop.

122
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:31,088
They don't look that bad,
though, for cops.

123
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,383
All right, let's go.

124
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,636
-He"s got company.
-Give me a break.

125
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,058
-Here comes trouble.
-Look at you.

126
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,561
-You came.
-Congratulations, you're moving up.

127
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,689
Mr. Big Shot honors us
with his presence.

128
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,400
-At your service. You look great.
-Thanks.

129
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,402
Everybody,
this is my girlfriend, Amada.

130
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,321
-That's my father...
-Nice to meet you.

131
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,947
...Chief Burt Grusinsky.

132
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,907
-My brother, Joe.
-Hi.

133
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,576
That's Michael and Jack.

134
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,286
You guys look good.

135
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:06,749
-You put up with this guy?
-l'm a Leo. I can put up with anything.

136
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,627
If you got a minute,
we'd like to talk to you.

137
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,255
-Let"s get a drink first.
-No, right now. Right now.

138
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,174
It's only gonna take a minute.

139
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,259
-Upstairs in the church.
-"'Right now."'

140
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,927
Come on.

141
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,263
Don't worry. We'll bring him back
in one piece.

142
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,190
That's a great crowd
you got down there, Joe.

143
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:35,194
-You know all the right people.
-That's a nice suit you got, Bobby.

144
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,071
Was that funny?

145
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,990
I didn't know you had a sense
of humor, Michael. l like it.

146
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,951
How much did that earring
set you back?

147
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,038
-What?
-You heard what I said.

148
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,582
Bobby, I asked Pop
to bring you up here.

149
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:53,212
-Bobby. Please, l'm serious.
-Why? What's the matter?

150
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,132
I'll be heading up this new
narcotics team starting this week.

151
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,927
Russian unit
out of PSA-One in Brighton.

152
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,055
What?

153
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,140
You brought me up here
to tell me that?

154
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,314
Do any of you fucking guys talk?

155
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,776
-You ever say anything back there?
-l'm old-fashioned. l listen first.

156
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,612
Oh, God. Excuse me.

157
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,823
We"re looking at this guy,
Vadim Nezhinski.

158
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,785
Served time in the Soviet Union
for black-market activity...

159
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:29,915
...come over in 1 979.
He's dealing H, cocaine, angel dust.

160
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,669
This guy's bringing in major weight
and we need to track it.

161
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,090
He's operating out of that spot
you manage, the El Caribe.

162
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,844
Oh, l don't know nothing
about that. I'm not--

163
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,721
No, we know. We checked
the rest of the management too...

164
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,474
-...his uncle, the owner.
-The old man?

165
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,811
-Well, he is his uncle.
-You been fucking watching me too?

166
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:55,190
Everybody else came up clean.
It's just Nezhinski we're looking at.

167
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,903
You want me to inform?

168
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,572
No.

169
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,283
-Are you kidding me?
-Just observe, that's all.

170
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,327
It's a closed community.
You"re our only way in right now.

171
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,039
Great. You guys are the fucking cops.
Why are you coming to me?

172
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,041
Why--? Why is this my problem?

173
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,130
The whole city's falling apart. Don't
you have any sense of responsibility?

174
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,340
Let me think.

175
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,635
No. No, not really. l don't.
I got enough fucking problems, Joe.

176
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,721
The streets are
in fucking chaos, Bobby.

177
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,724
-Our guys are dropping like flies.
-Joseph, come on. l--

178
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:33,061
Joseph, you go downstairs.
Let me talk to him, all right?

179
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,064
-Yeah, thanks for coming.
-lt's always a pleasure. Thank you.

180
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,692
You better be careful out there
the next couple weeks.

181
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,486
-What's that mean?
-You know.

182
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,739
-Joseph.
-Fine, Pop. You fucking deal with him.

183
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,578
-Take care, Bobby.
-Yeah.

184
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,374
Move over. Move over.

185
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,547
Been a long time
since we've seen you.

186
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,217
Your brother says you don"t
answer the phone anymore.

187
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,260
I've been busy, Pop. That's all.

188
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,054
Yeah?

189
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,723
What's going on with you?

190
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,436
You can't talk?

191
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,438
I don't know.

192
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,482
You what?

193
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,275
Things are all right.

194
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,402
-You're all right?
-Yeah.

195
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,737
Yeah?

196
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:27,908
You know, I could"ve gotten you
a good job with us, a safe job.

197
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,453
If you would have asked.
If you'd been around.

198
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,790
I got a job. l got a job. A good job.

199
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,918
That's the whole point
of this conversation we had.

200
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,213
That's why your brother was here,
because of this club.

201
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,639
Your brother says that you've been
using your mother's name these days.

202
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,809
Yeah, just for the business.
You know, it"s easy.

203
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,311
"Bobby Green'"?

204
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,314
Well, people can pronounce it,
you know?

205
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,818
That Puerto Rican you brought.
She been hooking you up?

206
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,989
-What do you mean?
-Come on, I can smell it on you.

207
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,074
You keep laughing.

208
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,661
Your mother, rest in peace,
I think she was too easy on you.

209
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,541
All right.

210
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,336
I gotta go, Pop.

211
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,673
Bobby, let me tell you something.

212
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:29,303
Sooner or later,
either you're gonna be with us...

213
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,222
...or you're gonna be
with the drug dealers.

214
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,308
This is like a war out there.

215
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,769
Now, do you understand that?

216
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,481
Do you?

217
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,737
I'll see you.

218
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,197
Careful.

219
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,549
It's getting late. How are
the kids doing? They tired yet?

220
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:11,053
They"re always tired. They worry
about you when you're out at night.

221
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,263
-Baby, sit up straight.
-Baby, do me a favor.

222
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,182
Don't start, all right?

223
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,268
Excuse me, everybody.
Can l have your attention, please?

224
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,857
Hi, my name is Deputy Commissioner
Spiro Giavannis...

225
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:27,527
...and we're here this holiday season
to honor one of our new leaders....

226
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,779
Let's get out of here...

227
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,906
-...and go party with Jumbo.
-Why?

228
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:34,409
Baby, your family don't like me,
I don't care. I"m here for you, okay?

229
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,203
Fuck them. Let's go. lt's boring.

230
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,038
-They're stiffs. Yeah.
-Really?

231
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,499
I'm sure the chief would like
to say a few words.

232
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,251
So l'd like to bring him
up here now. Chief?

233
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,592
Thank you. Thank you very much.

234
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,302
Yeah, chief.

235
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,931
You know, I used to tell my kids,
"Work first, play later."'

236
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,267
And my son Joseph
really took that to heart.

237
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:03,605
Been a real fighter over the years.
He overcome the dyslexia...

238
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:07,818
...and eventually wound up
graduating John Jay as salutatorian.

239
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,736
And hey....

240
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:13,031
I'm very proud here tonight.

241
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:27,546
I wanna thank you all for coming.
Happy Thanksgiving.

242
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,132
Before I say anything else...

243
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,385
...one of our brothers was killed
in the line of duty last night.

244
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,971
Edward Conlon was gunned down...

245
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,473
...serving a warrant
on Northern Boulevard.

246
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,308
Hey. Come here.

247
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,103
The clock is about to strike 1 1 .

248
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:47,232
I thought we might be able to give
a moment of silence to remember.

249
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,281
-Come on, get over here.
-Which one?

250
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,701
Come on, l'm meeting with Buzhayev
tonight. Which one? This one?

251
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,995
That one. Hey, baby.

252
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,872
-l got good news.
-Yeah?

253
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,209
So l talked to my mom yesterday.
She"s feeling better.

254
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,337
So l can move in whenever I want.

255
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,049
Really?

256
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,219
-Don't joke with me.
-l'm not.

257
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,847
I like it. l like it.

258
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:04,559
It's official. You get your side
of the bed, I get mine.

259
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:07,562
Seriously, it's great news.

260
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,024
-Hey, l got you something.
-What?

261
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:14,236
You"ve been working so hard lately.

262
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,617
-What is it?
-Open it up.

263
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,994
-Now?
-Go ahead, open it.

264
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,548
It's nice.

265
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,008
I like it.

266
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,844
Thank you.

267
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,931
-l love you so much.
-l love you too, babe.

268
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,809
We"ll have a lot of kids...

269
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,895
-...big house.
-Yeah?

270
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,608
Can we get big kids
and a lot of houses?

271
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,027
Hey, Bobby! Get your ass out here.

272
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,614
It's probably Jumbo. Come on, let's
go hang out with them for a minute.

273
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,284
Everybody, the life of the party
is here.

274
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,244
Hey, Falsetti,
you get what we wanted?

275
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,205
Absolutely. l got a little of
what everybody asked for here.

276
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:11,293
I got uppers, l got downers.
Hash, mescaline, some blow.

277
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,504
The troops require sustenance.

278
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,706
Go, go, go!

279
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,796
You gotta get dressed.
You gotta get dressed.

280
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,840
Come on, get dressed.

281
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,301
You can't be late
for the boss, baby.

282
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:13,021
-Bobby!
-Well, hello, how are you?

283
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,858
I thought you could ride. Not riding
so good. You don't ride bareback?

284
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,735
How are you?

285
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,987
-Bobby.
-You wouldn't believe it.

286
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:26,034
It's 40 degrees out, line's halfway
around the block. It's unbelievable.

287
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,995
I'll grab something in a second,
thank you.

288
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,959
Take kids in the other room.

289
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:38,713
Don't worry, kids.

290
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:42,342
You will see Grandpa on Tuesday
to ride the horses.

291
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,469
Not on the furs!

292
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,179
-Bobby.
-Pop.

293
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,139
-Have a seat.
-Why? What'd l miss?

294
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,392
Listen, we"re thinking
about expanding.

295
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,646
Maybe we'll open another spot
next year across from Brighton.

296
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,564
-l like it.
-Yeah, good.

297
00:21:56,732 --> 00:22:00,568
And we think you"ll run it
and we'll do it exactly like here.

298
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,278
-Could be good.
-Good?

299
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,906
Good, yeah. Listen...

300
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:08,493
...l've been thinking. lf you wanna
open another spot, l mean...

301
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,871
-...why not try Manhattan?
-Manhattan's very expensive.

302
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,248
Depends on where you go.

303
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,001
I mean, you get in there now,
get something for cheap.

304
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,420
I'm talking a big space,
a big warehouse.

305
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,130
You get different levels going.

306
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,465
We could do something different
on each floor.

307
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,426
Like one floor could be rock 'n' roll.

308
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,679
Then you do another floor,
you got disco. Something like that.

309
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,641
He's got so many ideas!

310
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:36,146
And don't let your hair-brained
nephew Vadim screw it up!

311
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,523
It's a lot of money, Papa.

312
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:42,444
Your fur business can
support that right now?

313
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:46,072
My son-in-law, he worries people
take advantage of me.

314
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
I understand that.

315
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,909
But l think we can do something
special and different.

316
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,245
Worst-case scenario,
it"s a great investment.

317
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,789
I mean, l think
it"s worth looking into.

318
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,333
All right.

319
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,587
So bring some details.
We"ll figure out the numbers.

320
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,464
-Yeah?
-Okay?

321
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,049
Good.

322
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,217
I love you.

323
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,853
Hey, who is this?

324
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:20,565
You are in the presence
of the future king of New York.

325
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,776
The future king?
What are you talking about?

326
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,487
Listen, nothing's definite
so don't say anything.

327
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,072
I was just with Mr. Buzhayev.

328
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,783
He's talking about opening
another spot in Manhattan.

329
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,412
He wants me to run it.
I want you, my brother, to be a host.

330
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,665
Of course! I'm a people person.
That's my specialty.

331
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,001
-l know.
-My fucking man.

332
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,003
I'm the "hoster"' with the "'moster."'

333
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:45,006
That's beautiful news, Bob.
Beautiful.

334
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:48,468
Now you'll finally be getting me
all the women I deserve.

335
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,345
What's Amada doing
at Vadim's table?

336
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:56,601
She"s doing what she's supposed
to do. She's charming the customers.

337
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:01,397
-What do you hear about him, Jumbo?
-l don't know what l hear.

338
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:05,193
-l hear stories.
-You hear stories. Like what?

339
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,694
Stories.

340
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:11,116
Like last year, one of his guys
was gonna rat him out.

341
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,118
Cops found his head
on Brighton Avenue.

342
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,122
-Fucking dick was in his mouth.
-Sure it wasn't your dick?

343
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,583
Are you sure it wasn't your mouth?

344
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,882
But l tell you, he wouldn't be
running around here like a king...

345
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,677
...if his uncle didn't own the place,
that much l know.

346
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:32,053
I gotta get back to work.

347
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,931
All right. Nice talking to you. Bye.

348
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,183
I'm gonna go talk to Amada.

349
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:41,396
-All right, I'll see you later.
-l'll be downstairs.

350
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,741
I was just telling her how you
stuffed a pill up her nose.

351
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,661
Yeah, that's going
on the wall of shame.

352
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,122
See you later.

353
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,374
Hey, babe, listen.

354
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,252
I don't think you should be around
Vadim so much right now.

355
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,296
Why? You jealous?

356
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,465
No, I'm not jealous. Listen,
it"s nothing for you to worry about.

357
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,633
Okay.

358
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,094
I wanna tell you about
my meeting with Buzhayev.

359
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,429
This is the police!

360
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:17,015
-This is a raid!
-Let"s go.

361
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,851
-Police!
-Fuck.

362
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:23,271
Let's find this motherfucker right now.
Let's go.

363
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,816
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

364
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,319
Everybody get your hands
on your fucking heads.

365
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,071
-Let go of me, man.
-Get the fuck down!

366
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,955
Empty your pockets! Oh, jackpot.

367
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,042
-Get on the bar. Hands on the bar.
-Who authorized this?

368
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,336
Tell me who authorized it.
I have the right--

369
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,713
What's the matter? You on
something? Come here.

370
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,634
That's right. Hands on your
fucking head and don"t move!

371
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,136
-Hey, easy, easy.
-Toss them all, Pudge!

372
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:58,139
-Where is he?
-Get on-- Get on the fucking ground!

373
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,558
Give him the charcoal.
Open your fucking mouth!

374
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,185
Who the fuck authorized this?

375
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:05,772
-l'm looking for Vadim Nezhinski.
-He must be on something.

376
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,441
Get the fucking charcoal.
You do a little dust?

377
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,277
-Bring him the fuck down here!
-Get this piece of shit up.

378
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,947
-Where is he?
-He"s up here, captain! We got him.

379
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,282
How about some charcoal
to absorb the toxins?

380
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,534
Clear some space here
for me, ladies, please.

381
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,995
-Turn him, he's gonna puke.
-Where's Nezhinski?

382
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,957
-Get this piece of shit up.
-Here we go.

383
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,834
-Give me some space here, please.
-Get the fuck out here.

384
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,670
-Who else?
-Don't you move.

385
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,088
-Turn around.
-Here we go.

386
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,840
What are you looking at?
Turn your head the other way.

387
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:41,516
Turn around.

388
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:45,853
-What is this?
-Stay down, stay down.

389
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,147
Tough guy, huh?

390
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,275
What, you want me
to double your money?

391
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,488
-Stay down.
-There it is.

392
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:58,533
It's doubled. How's that?

393
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,703
What are you looking at?
Turn around.

394
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,333
What else you got in here, huh,
joker? What about the girls?

395
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,795
Come here.
You got anything in here?

396
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,384
You got a cross and a Jewish star
on you.

397
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,970
-What's the matter? You confused?
-Not me.

398
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,598
-What we got?
-This one's holding.

399
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,226
-Couple dimes of cocaine, some PCP.
-Good.

400
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,479
You and you are under arrest.
Possession and sale of narcotics.

401
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,065
Talk to them and
we go after your mother.

402
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,735
What the fuck
did you just say to him?

403
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,070
Nothing.

404
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:41,200
Your boy's gonna open up on you.
And when he does, l"m coming back.

405
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,912
All right. Let's go.

406
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,581
Come on!

407
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:51,586
Good night, everybody. Pleasure
doing business with you. Wrap it up.

408
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,921
Let's go.

409
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,758
-Mr. Buzhayev.
- Yes?

410
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,385
-l'm Captain Jack Shapiro.
-Nice to meet you.

411
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,137
This has nothing to do with you...

412
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,848
...but do you have a nephew
named Vadim Nezhinski?

413
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,601
-Yes.
-Does he have an office here?

414
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:09,771
Clean him up. I don't want to
get it all over the car.

415
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,689
You got him dirty, you clean him up.

416
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,734
-Does he have an office here?
-No.

417
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,444
Okay.

418
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,197
We"ll be in touch.

419
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,282
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

420
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,789
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, my God!

421
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,291
-How the fuck did he get out here?
-Get out!

422
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,461
-What do you got?
-Possession and resisting arrest.

423
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,880
He's also got $207 on him.

424
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,174
-Two-oh-seven? Take him in the back.
-Let"s go.

425
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,885
-Who frisked this asshole?
-Don't forget the pedigree.

426
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,388
-All right.
-We gotta stop the bleeding.

427
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,015
-What do you got?
-He"s bleeding all over the place.

428
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,643
-Don't touch him!
-Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

429
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,895
-The Russian guy cut himself open.
-Jesus.

430
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,481
-Where'd he get the blade?
-He had it on him, man.

431
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,859
Hey, hey.
What the fuck is going on in here?

432
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,654
-He cut his throat.
-He pulled some cutting, man.

433
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:03,074
Put pressure on him, all right?
Put pressure.

434
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,910
Why are you standing there?
Get us a fucking bus.

435
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,079
All right, all right, all right.

436
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:10,623
Shit.

437
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,049
Good morning, chief.

438
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:27,265
You ready to go home?

439
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,350
Or do you have a home?

440
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,355
Your brother wanted me
to let you out.

441
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:38,192
If it was up to me, l'd let you stay here
another couple of days or a week.

442
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,653
-Maybe a month.
-Do you want me to thank him?

443
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,157
Disgusting.

444
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,953
You"re uncontrollable. You know?

445
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,207
Give him a bath.

446
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,002
I ought to rap you one.

447
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:08,139
Hey, sign out with the desk sergeant
before you leave, please.

448
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:14,145
Guy cut his own throat.
Nezhinski must've...

449
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,689
-...really put the fear of God in him.
-Look...

450
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,358
...that guy knew how they're
bringing the product in.

451
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,902
-Absolutely.
-That's the key.

452
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,738
We find the right guy,
we're gonna get him....

453
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:42,757
We waited till it was your day off.
We had to go. l"m sorry. That"s it.

454
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:45,092
You had to hit that spot.
Of all the places...

455
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,513
-...you gotta come to my place?
-That's where Nezhinski"s been seen.

456
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,515
We supposed to
announce it in advance...

457
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,601
...and compromise the whole thing?
I told you l'm very sorry--

458
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:57,021
Sorry"s not good enough. You don't
come in, act like you own the place.

459
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,106
Got your guys putting shit
down my throat!

460
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,610
You want me to come in here, fuck
everything up, push everything around?

461
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,862
You wouldn't be in this
if you didn't fuck around!

462
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,491
No, I wouldn't be in this shit
if you weren't trying to be top cop.

463
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:11,536
You know fucking Nezhinski's guy?
His fucking throat cut open.

464
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,454
Congratulations, Captain Joe.
Good job!

465
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,582
Think you're above it? You fuck
around with your Puerto Rican?

466
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,877
-Grow up and act like a man--
-Try thinking about my Puerto Rican...

467
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,588
...while trying to fuck your fat wife!
How's that?

468
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,008
-Knock it off! Bobby!
-Get off!

469
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,302
-Come on!
-Get off me!

470
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,306
Don't touch me! You're not Pop!

471
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,893
I'm done with you. l don't wanna
see your fucking face anymore.

472
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,979
Get out of here!

473
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:44,652
I'm going home.

474
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,489
It's a fucking holiday.

475
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,171
Winter, spring, summer, fall...

476
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:08,843
...call 966-721 0 for reservations
at Pocono Gardens and....

477
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:12,680

478
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,275
Shit.

479
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,469
Jab, combination.

00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:56,349
Come on, dig. Dig. Come on.
Dig! Dig! Dig! Combination.

481
00:32:56,516 --> 00:33:00,061
Combination. Jab. Jab. Jab.

Dig. Dig. Dig. With authority.

483
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:05,691
Dig. Dig. Finish it up.
With authority.

484
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,860
That's it. That's it.

485
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:10,404
Good. Take a rest. Take a rest.

486
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,912
-Chief.
-Yeah.

487
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,087
Which kid is it?

488
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:34,095
It's Joseph.
He's in Jamaica Hospital.

489
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,598
It don't look good right now.

490
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,893
Want us to contact
your other son, chief?

491
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:44,105
No, I'll do that. Thanks.

492
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,232
You okay, chief?

493
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,111
You guys go on.
I'll be right out. Thank you.

494
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,621
-Chief.
-Yo, chief. You all right?

495
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:03,624
I'm all right. l'm all right.

496
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,752
C-note.

497
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,262
Come on, man. Let's go.

498
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:20,141
All right, tell you what, José.

499
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,101
I'll see you...

500
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,523
...and l"ll bump you two C's.

501
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:40,828
Call.

502
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:43,205
Hello.

503
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:47,710
Ladies and gentlemen, l'd like to
introduce you to José's new friends...

504
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:51,172
...Siegfried and Roy. Two queens.

505
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,967
-Hey, Bobby.
-How you like that, huh?

506
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:58,471
-Bobby!
-What? Hang up on them.

507
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,515
What you got?
Come on, you fold with that?

508
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,059
-That's what--
-lt's the police.

509
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,271
All right, all right, deal again.
Deal again. l'm feeling hot!

510
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,482
José, l thought you knew
how to play poker.

511
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,984
I told him to keep going.
He was gonna pack it in.

512
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,278
Go fuck yourself
and just deal the cards.

513
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,155
-Hello.
-Bobby?

514
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,907
Yeah.

515
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,868
Bobby, it's Michael Solo.
I got some bad news.

516
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,704
It's your brother.
Your brother"s been shot.

517
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:27,208
About an hour ago,
outside his house.

518
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,375
What? Who?

519
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,962
Can you hear me? Your brother's
been shot. He's at Jamaica Hospital.

520
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,756
They're working on him now.

521
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,175
What are you talking about?
I was just with him.

522
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,219
Listen, your father's coming.
I gotta go.

523
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:42,223
But he's at Jamaica.
I just thought you should know.

524
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,227
What happened?

525
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,066
-My brother was shot.
-Oh, my God.

526
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,696
They're operating on him--

527
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,032
They're operating on him right now.
I gotta--

528
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,742
Bobby.

529
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,912
-Where are my keys?
-They should be on your desk.

530
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,415
-l'll get my coat. I'll go with you.
-No. No.

531
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,668
Stay here tonight.
I'll call you later.

532
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:14,630
-Bobby, l wanna go with you.
-No. I'll call later.

533
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:17,633
Bobkes?

534
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:21,095
-Where you going?
-Deal the cards, man.

535
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:37,653
Pop, Joe gonna be all right?

536
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,114
He's all right?

537
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,951
You got into a fight with him,
I heard.

538
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:48,706
-No.
-Well, you got what you wanted...

539
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:51,083
...and you stayed out of it.

540
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,168
-Burt.
-Why would you say that?

541
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,297
-The union sent a shrink over for you.
-l don't need that crap.

542
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,424
-Your Honor.
-Chief.

543
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:02,636
-Chief, I'm sorry.
-What happened, Michael? Tell me.

544
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:04,638
-What's going on?
-l'm glad you're here.

545
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,765
First, I wanna tell you
how sorry I am.

546
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:10,686
We'll get them, Your Honor.
I'll come back in and run it myself.

547
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:13,188
The bullet went into his cheek,
came out his jaw.

548
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,232
-lt missed his brain, thank God.
-Jesus.

549
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,942
He's very lucky, considering.

550
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,153
Do you know who did it?

551
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:21,655
No.

552
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,658
Definitely a professional.
They bombed his car.

553
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,662
It's a calling card.
We think it's the Russians.

554
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:33,667
You know, it's a real shame
we didn't get to Nezhinski before this.

555
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,671
Are you fucking blaming me?

556
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,008
No.

557
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:44,845
But l'm not the only one
around here with an opinion.

558
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,810
Best-case scenario...

559
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:56,231
...doctor says your brother will have to
be here for at least a couple months.

560
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:58,150
Anyway...

561
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,362
...let's just--
Let's just hope he pulls through.

562
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,489
I'm going to see him.

563
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,454
-Easy.
-Nobody's allowed in...

564
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,706
-...except immediate family.
-l'm his brother.

565
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:14,291
I'm his fucking brother!

566
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,543
Officers, hold on!
Let him in. It's all right.

567
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,546
-His nametag says "Green."
-lt's his brother.

568
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,423
Okay, boss.

569
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,701
I'm sorry, Joe.

570
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:37,142
This guy got two queens
and he bumps the guy $200?

571
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:41,105
And then he wins and where the fuck
do you run off to, like a Jew, huh?

572
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,107
The place went fucking bananas.

573
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,527
I gotta straighten things out. I had
to bust some heads like Bruce Lee.

574
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,695
I'm in there busting fucking heads.
They--

575
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,323
All right, Jumbo?
Jumbo, do me a favor.

576
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:54,201
Would you grab the check?
Let's get out of here. I'm tired.

577
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,037
All right, fine. I'll go pay the check.

578
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,999
But, Bob, just don't forget that nobody
could ever do for you what l did.

579
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,418
Busting heads.

580
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,588
Hey, don't say nothing to Jumbo
about what happened, all right?

581
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:10,008
Of course. I just thought he could
cheer you up a little, that's all.

582
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,052
-Thanks.
-Look who's here.

583
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,556
-Hi, Vadim.
-Hey.

584
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,766
We were just about to leave.

585
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,687
-How you doing?
-l'm all right.

586
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,064
Made it through the bust okay?

587
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,985
-l'm here.
-Good. Good. Glad to hear it.

588
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,655
Your uncle's got some
trouble now, though.

589
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,907
You fucked up the club.

590
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:37,411
He does what he's gotta do,
I do what l got to do.

591
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:39,329
He don't own me.

592
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,374
He's got grandkids to worry about,
chasing them around.

593
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:53,427
Hey, baby, go keep Jumbo company
for a sec, all right?

594
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,680
Nice girl you got there.

595
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,433
One is prettier than the other.
He knows everybody.

596
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:01,018
He's pretty popular.

597
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:06,315
You must know a whole network
of people. Clubs, everything, huh?

598
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:09,067
Listen...

599
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,571
...l got some shit coming in.

600
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,991
And some of us think maybe
you could help us get it out there.

601
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,785
My product needs a reputation.

602
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,121
A little dangerous right now,
don't you think?

603
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,541
We got a lot of muscle behind this.

604
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,629
-Muscle?
-Yeah, that's right.

605
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,506
You know a cop got hit today?

606
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:34,468
Do you think
that was a coincidence?

607
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,975
Well, they're not gonna
sit still for that, you know?

608
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,144
Police are a fucking joke, dude.

609
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:46,730
Mickey Mouse ain't gonna
do nothing.

610
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,901
Cop got lucky. He zigged
when he should have zagged.

611
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,819
You sit with them.

612
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,036
Bobby.

613
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,705
The cops...

614
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,582
...they ain't no problem.

615
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,252
So don't worry about it.
We'll get them all.

616
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:12,339
You cut the head off, the body will fall.
Am l right?

617
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,051
We do it until they get the message.

618
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:20,097
We just heard that cop's father
is going to be in charge now.

619
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,099
We'll get him too.

620
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,604
We got all their names on a list.

621
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,566
The chief of police will be next.

622
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:36,321
If you change your mind, call Pavel.

623
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:38,782
I got a great product.

624
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,410
Why don't you come down
and check it out for yourself?

625
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,120
All right.

626
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:53,213
Well, you're wrong, chief.

627
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,340
We gotta make a move.
We gotta make it now.

628
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:58,635
-No! We don't go nuts.
-You heard what Bobby just said.

629
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,179
Nezhinski's got a contract
out on us, Burt.

630
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,391
I know that. You wanna
take over my department?

631
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,351
You wanna run it?
What do you wanna do?

632
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,687
-l want an answer from you.
-Answer for what?

633
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:13,066
I have no answers now.
We're looking for him, all right?

634
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,404
Use your head. If we go arrest them,
they'd be back on the street in a day.

635
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,740
We gotta catch them
with their hands full...

636
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,993
...find out where they got the real
weight, then we make the move.

637
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:26,079
-We don't have that much time.
-Doesn't matter. lt's the right play.

638
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,581
-l say we hit them all.
-What?

639
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:30,876
-Wipe them out. No survivors.
-Don't be a first-class schmuck.

640
00:44:31,044 --> 00:44:34,296
-We don't have the time to infiltrate.
-That is exactly my point.

641
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:36,048
Then we make the time.

642
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,425
-At whose expense?
-Hold on!

643
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,969
I want you all
to understand something, all right?

644
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:44,264
We don't ever play in the dirt here.
Not ever, no matter what.

645
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:48,352
When you piss in your pants,
you can only stay warm for so long.

646
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:52,898
Bobby.

647
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:55,942
Is there anything else you know
or anything you can tell us?

648
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,280
Nezhinski come in and...

649
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,825
...he was saying they're trying
to create a brand name, that they...

650
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:05,994
...wanna corner the market.

651
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,330
Why did he tell you this?

652
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:13,210
I don't know. He thought
I could help him build a reputation.

653
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,212
Nice friends you got there.

654
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,382
Know what, Pop? He's not my friend.
All right? He came at me.

655
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:19,925
All right.

656
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:22,386
I'm not interested in that.
I don't deal.

657
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,012
But didn't you lead him on?

658
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,223
No, I didn't fucking lead him on.

659
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:30,143
The guy's crazy. He told me
I could come look at his operation.

660
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:32,813
-l didn't even ask.
-He talked about his operation?

661
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,607
Maybe that's it. Maybe that's key.

662
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:37,651
What's your point?

663
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:40,445
We put a Kel on him.
Then send one of our uncles in.

664
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:42,948
Wait a minute. Wait.
Who's gonna be the tail?

665
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:47,452
No, forget about it. No way.
No. Forget it. Forget it!

666
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,288
You go to his spot, right?
And you let him talk.

667
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,290
You let him hang himself.

668
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,001
And then we trail you,
you know, to the location.

669
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,837
A week later, we pop him.

670
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:59,256
And your name's cleared.
Nobody knows it's you.

671
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:02,134
Mike, it's too dangerous for him.
He's my son.

672
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,554
-He's connected to all of us.
-No one knows I'm connected to you.

673
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:09,057
-What?
-l don't talk about you.

674
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:13,520
What about your girlfriend?
She knows about you, right?

675
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:17,774
Yeah.

676
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:22,362
All right, leave me alone
a minute. Okay?

677
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:28,702
I gotta fill out these line-of-duty reports
for your brother, for Joseph.

678
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:40,046
I didn't know this
was gonna happen, Pop.

679
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:42,924
Yeah, well...

680
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:45,343
...what can you do, right?

681
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,139
I don't want you to get hurt.

682
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:53,351
Don't worry about me.
Just worry about yourself.

683
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,730
I hear anything about your brother,
I'll call you. Goodbye.

684
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,903
Goodbye.

685
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,854
Hey, baby.

686
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,981
Hey, babe.

687
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:45,070
How's your father?
Is he holding up okay?

688
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:48,281
-Yeah.
-Good.

689
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:51,743
I heard on the television
your brother's doing better.

690
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,123
Me and my mom,
we said a prayer for him.

691
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:00,377
Thanks, baby.

692
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,964
Did they find out who did it?

693
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:10,428
Baby?

694
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,435
It was Vadim.

695
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,523
Vadim shot Joseph.

696
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:27,445
Oh, my God.

697
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,948
They tried to tell me...

698
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:33,827
-...but I didn't listen.
-Oh, my God.

699
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:37,497
Bobby, what are we gonna do?

700
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:09,988
Michael.

701
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,536
Hey.

702
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,708
You been up to see Joe?

703
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:26,254
Yeah. He's doing much better.
They reset his jaw this morning.

704
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:31,551
He was awake when l left him.
Your old man's up there with him now.

705
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,637
How you doing?

706
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:39,559
You can't protect my father.

707
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:42,562
We'll do the best we can.

708
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,523
Those guys aren't afraid
of the police.

709
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:49,194
If anything should happen to him....

710
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:55,492
Listen, that thing
you were talking about...

711
00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:00,038
...if I wanted to help you,
what would l have to do?

712
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:06,586
I'll call you.

713
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:16,221
There's a wire in here.
We hear everything that goes down.

714
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:20,100
We'd also have a tail on you,
so we'd be with you at all times.

715
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,687
Small. Light as a feather.

716
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:27,315
You're fucking kidding me. That's it?

717
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:31,736
That's it. That's the risk.
You just gotta find that stash house.

718
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:34,280
-This can't get out.
-lt won't.

719
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:41,079
Well, what if
something goes wrong?

720
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:46,084
Give me a word.
First word comes to your mind.

721
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,630
-Feather.
-Okay.

722
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:54,467
Anytime we hear the word "feather,"
we come in early.

723
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:58,138
Otherwise, stay there, do what you
gotta do and get the fuck out.

724
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:01,933
-This will all be kept confidential.
-Yeah, it better.

725
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,105
You get burnt, we have to
put you into protection.

726
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:09,649
That's better than ending up dead.

727
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,653
-Fuck.
-Listen...

728
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:16,448
...nobody will ever know
you're involved.

729
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:20,577
Not your father, not your girlfriend,
nobody.

730
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:23,997
And maybe someday your brother
will thank you for all this.

731
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:25,915
So, Bobby...

732
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,335
...you call Vadim's people
and set it up.

733
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:33,506
You won't see us, but we'll be
following your every move.

734
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:37,010
Don't be a hero.
Don't make conversation.

735
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:41,181
You sense they're onto you,
just remember the word is "feather."

736
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:43,641
Your life is in that lighter.

737
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:45,769
Good luck.

738
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:07,207
Bobkes. Jesus.

739
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,209
Where you been?
I left you a message.

740
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,544
-Yeah, I got it. Thanks.
-You all right?

741
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,338
-Yeah.
-What's the matter? You sick?

742
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:15,381
Yeah, l've been out of it. I gotta--

743
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,716
Come on, Amada's here.

744
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,718
-Two Jack Daniels, please.
-No, no, no.

745
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:22,388
I gotta take care of something.
I'll call you tomorrow.

746
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,766
All right. Call me tomorrow.

747
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:41,199
Please.

748
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,703
See my friends out there?

749
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:51,584
Vadim is really glad
that you made up your mind.

750
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:54,128
He's very happy.

751
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:58,633
You ready?

752
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,846
Yeah.

753
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:07,767
You'll meet me at the boardwalk
in one hour.

754
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,602
For your protection, and for ours...

755
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:13,022
...you'll be searched and blindfolded
as we arrive.

756
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,567
You'll be able
to sample the product...

757
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,736
...see if you like it. I'm sure you will.

758
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,698
You will discuss the rest
of the details with Vadim.

759
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:24,367
Don't raise your voice,
he doesn't like it.

760
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,787
And for me...

761
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,876
...l'm taking you to the place
where l never took anybody before...

762
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,545
...especially no Americans.

763
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:40,425
And l don't trust you
the way Vadim does.

764
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,511
So don't.

765
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,471
All right?

766
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:50,393
And if you want to see
your girlfriend ever again...

767
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:51,978
...you will come alone.

768
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,067
Boardwalk. One hour.

769
00:54:57,002 --> 00:55:00,129
You don't mind
that I sit behind, do you?

770
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:02,966
Do what you gotta do.

771
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,806
Let me see your hands.

772
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:17,934
Take this. Put it on.

773
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:59,535
What do you think?

774
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:02,622
Good.

775
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,334
What do you got there?
How many keys?

776
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,794
What, like three to four months?

777
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,922
It's not gonna dry up on us, is it?

778
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,883
We got a whole lot of stuff
coming in...

779
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:16,427
...in a way nobody could ever trace.

780
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:29,023
All the shit l got in here,
at least 86 percent pure.

781
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:30,691
Sasha.

782
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:51,921
The whole city will be
sucking our glass soon.

783
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,674
We'll push the guineas out.
The Domos will work for us.

784
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,342
It's good.

785
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,555
So where's this coming from?

786
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:18,281
You're breathing heavy.

787
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:21,659
Yeah, because I just took a hit.

788
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:32,128
You know, I seen fighters
breathe like that.

789
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:34,422
It means they get nervous.

790
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:37,550
-Are you nervous?
-No.

791
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,012
I told you,
it's because I took some shit.

792
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,222
What do I have
to be nervous about?

793
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:51,731
They already searched me.

794
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,900
I'm not here to fuck you.
What are you doing?

795
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:21,385
How come you got both
matches and a lighter?

796
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:27,141
I'm feeling light as a feather
from that shit.

797
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,607
-What?
-Feeling light as a feather...

798
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,776
...from that stuff.

799
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,246
-He's wired.
-No, wait.

800
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:52,500
You were right.
Kill the motherfucker.

801
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,960
Wait. Wait! Wait!

802
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:13,896
Get up! Get over there!

803
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,650
Take the roof. Bobby!

804
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,075
Get the weapon!

805
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,497
Go, go!

806
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:48,139
-Police! Don't move!
-l'm with you! I'm with you!

807
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,516
Don't move!

808
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:03,112
Police! Don't move!

809
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,740
Put your hands up! Put your
hands up! Put your hands up!

810
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,659
Back up to my voice!

811
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:14,915
-Who is he? ls he one of us?
-He's still breathing.

812
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,001
Get him a stretcher, quick.

813
01:03:17,169 --> 01:03:20,045
Copy that, Rescue 238.
Patient is a Caucasian male...

814
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:23,174
...mid-30s, with a leg fracture,
broken ribs, abrasions...

815
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,050
...and a possible neck injury.

816
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,109
Where's Bobby? Where's my son?

817
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:44,570
He's in the bus, chief.
They said he'll be okay.

818
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,364
You guys call an operation
like this without telling me?

819
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:49,241
You think I was born yesterday?

820
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:51,243
-He came to me.
-He could've been killed!

821
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:53,162
-Are you out of your mind?
-l'm sorry.

822
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,373
Well, my son's gotta go into
protection now. Thank you very much.

823
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:57,958
-lt was his idea.
-Where is he?

824
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:00,586
I wanna see him. Is he all right?

825
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:04,256
He's a dead man.

826
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:16,936
You hear me, son?

827
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:23,859
Crazy kid.

828
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:26,362
Stupid kid.

829
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:27,571
Pop...

830
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:30,616
...my girlfriend.

831
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:33,702
Call my girlfriend.

832
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:37,373
Don't worry. l'll call her, all right?

833
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:40,167
I'll let your brother know too.

834
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:42,920
We gotta get you....

835
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:46,799
Get you well again.

836
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,969
Things are gonna be different
for you now, Bobby.

837
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,763
We're gonna
have to protect you now.

838
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:06,777
1 010 WINS. You give us 22 minutes,
we'll give you the world.

839
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:10,197
This is Stan Brooks in Queens.
Police captain Joseph Grusinsky...

840
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:12,783
...is leaving Jamaica Hospital
this afternoon.

841
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:16,495
His doctors cleared him for release
following a four-month stay.

842
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:19,665
The 1 1-year veteran was shot
in the face by a masked gunman...

843
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:23,335
...outside his home
the night before Thanksgiving.

844
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:28,090
Hey, big guys,
let's see what you got.

845
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:30,593
Get out. Get lost.

846
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:35,014
Everybody, l see the car.

847
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,601
Here they are.

848
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,028
Welcome home, Joe.

849
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:53,657
Welcome home. We love you.

850
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:56,035
Hey, kiddo. You look great.

851
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:58,746
-Welcome home.
-Hey, Bob.

852
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:02,541
-l saw your guards out there.
-Daddy!

853
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:05,210
-l didn't think they'd let you come.
-No, I wanted to.

854
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:08,339
What's up? What's up, buddy?

855
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:11,675
-Hey, how's your leg? You all right?
-Yeah. I'm glad you're home.

856
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:14,219
Hey, we'll talk later, all right?

857
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:18,015
Everyone, let's move inside.
There's plenty to eat.

858
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:20,309
You gonna eat? Young lady. No?

859
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:27,274
Stop it!

860
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:29,401
Joe, you look just great.

861
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:33,072
-Does it hurt at all?
-Yeah, a little, when l look at you.

862
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:36,492
Oh, finally.
Finally he gets you back.

863
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,994
Do you think maybe we could
go see my mom?

864
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:42,748
No, honey, they made an exception
for this. l'm sorry, I don't think you can.

865
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,416
Hey, Pop.

866
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:47,753
You wanna go outside and
talk a little business on the porch?

867
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,963
It's time you
brought me back up to speed.

868
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:51,757
Whatever you say. Let's go.

869
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:55,260
Bobby, come on, I want you
to hear this. lt's for the trial.

870
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,429
-All right.
-Baby, l wanna go.

871
01:06:57,597 --> 01:07:00,641
-No, stay here. l'll be 1 0 minutes, tops.
-Let me just go back.

872
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:04,103
No. Just wait here. We'll go back
to the motel together.

873
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,522
Hey, Sandra, these brownies
are really good.

874
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,107
Careful.

875
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,735
Nezhinski's cache was
even bigger than we thought.

876
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,905
Forty kilos of yayo. Angel dust too.

877
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:16,865
We gotta try to
make a deal with him...

878
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,034
...find out how they're bringing it in.

879
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:21,120
He might not be too reliable, Pop.

880
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,288
Hey, listen, you marry an ape...

881
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,749
...you don't complain
about the stench of bananas.

882
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,378
-Where is he now?
-At Rikers, tucked in nice and comfy.

883
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,296
We take him
to the ADA's next week.

884
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:34,383
Good, I wanna go with you on that.
I wanna see his fucking face.

885
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:38,429
We gotta lean hard, get him to open
up. We got nowhere else to look.

886
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:40,556
Well, what about his uncle?
Buzhayev?

887
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:42,307
No, he's clean.

888
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:45,102
We tapped his phone, tailed him.
We got nothing.

889
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,937
Went to his fur store on Monday.

890
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:49,773
Tuesday he took his grandkids
horseback riding.

891
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:52,484
-Nothing there.
-l'll tell you, the streets are dead.

892
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:56,238
The junkies are out there waiting
for something big, no question.

893
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,991
Well, we got their number one.

894
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:01,785
Gotta put the full-court press
on him, get him to fold.

895
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:04,496
-lt won't work.
-What?

896
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:10,836
He won't trust you. These guys
think of you like you're a joke.

897
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:13,797
They call you Mickey Mouse.
He's not gonna turn for you.

898
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:17,301
Listen to the expert here. You don't
gotta get involved in this no more.

899
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:20,345
I asked him to come in.
He's gotta know all this to testify.

900
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,514
This is official police business, Pop.

901
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:25,434
You gonna make him an honorary
member of the department?

902
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:27,603
-What's the matter with you?
-He's right.

903
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:29,146
Didn't you hear what l said?

904
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:33,317
I asked him to come in here.
I brought him in.

905
01:08:33,485 --> 01:08:36,695
Your brother's got a price on his head
and you talk to him like that?

906
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:43,869
-Let's go.
-You have to wait for another car.

907
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:47,331
Ms. Juarez just left.
She went to her mother's.

908
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:49,166
-Bobby.
-What?

909
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:51,668
What was said in there,
he didn't mean it.

910
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,504
Ever since this thing happened...

911
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:56,715
...he flies off the handle sometimes.
But, you know--

912
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,259
Doctor says it may be part
of a stress disorder.

913
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:02,262
-Needs a little more time to adjust.
-l understand that, Pop.

914
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:05,641
I got my own shit to deal with.
I got a girlfriend that's pissed off.

915
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:07,643
I just want this to be over with.

916
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:11,313
Listen to me. A lot of people been
talking about how good you did.

917
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:15,234
Now, l think,
considering the alternatives...

918
01:09:15,944 --> 01:09:18,570
...maybe you ought to think
about going on the job.

919
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:22,074
You got special knowledge.
The department likes that.

920
01:09:22,242 --> 01:09:23,492
I'm gonna go, Pop.

921
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,745
Why do you have to go?
Where you going?

922
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:34,419
-Think fast.
-Hey.

923
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,090
Hello.

924
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:44,763
-When is she gonna marry me?
-That is my mother. That's gross.

925
01:09:52,981 --> 01:09:55,691
-ls it all clear? Good.
-Place is clear.

926
01:09:57,151 --> 01:10:00,070
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

927
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:06,451
I'm sorry, but she can't be here
right now, okay?

928
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,453
Baby, l was just finishing eating.

929
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:12,541
Just get your stuff, let's go.
I'll be outside. l wanna talk to you.

930
01:10:25,305 --> 01:10:27,639
She can't do this, Jumbo.

931
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:31,810
There are people out there trying
to kill me. Understand? It's dangerous.

932
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,145
I-- l know.

933
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:35,856
She called me. l got no idea
where you guys are.

934
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:38,817
-Because no one can know.
-You all right?

935
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,114
I miss you.

936
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:45,657
Jeez, Bob.

937
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:48,035
I'm stressed out.
Don't know what I'm doing.

938
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:49,786
Me too.

939
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:53,749
Hey, Bob, everyone's asking
about you at El Caribe.

940
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:56,293
Freddie and all the girls...

941
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:59,087
...and Mr. Buzhayev.
I mean, you were like a son to him.

942
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,298
We were surprised
to hear about your family.

943
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:04,343
Your father's like J. Edgar Hoover.

944
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:07,262
I'm sorry I never said nothing.

945
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,556
Don't worry, Bob. It's all right.

946
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:13,185
Listen, l gotta get her out of here,
and we'll call you.

947
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:15,812
-Let's go.
-Okay.

948
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,357
We gotta move. Let's go.

949
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:28,158
She misses me, Bobby.

950
01:11:29,661 --> 01:11:34,164
-You got to see your family.
-l know, baby, but that's different.

951
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:35,540
How?

952
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,293
Mike and Vitt,
they have a route planned.

953
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:41,046
You can't just go
and jeopardize all this.

954
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:43,507
Nobody can even know
what motel we're staying at.

955
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:45,467
You gotta understand that.

956
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:49,930
Listen, baby, Vadim's trial's
in two months.

957
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:51,515
Two months.

958
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,396
I'm sorry.

959
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:03,360
It just feels like sometimes
the walls are closing in on me.

960
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:05,779
It's gonna be okay.

961
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:22,087
I'll go in the lead car. You stay
with him till we get to the A.D.A.

962
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:25,257
Yeah. We got two cars.
One behind, one in front.

963
01:12:25,425 --> 01:12:28,719
If we make a deal with him, then
my brother don't have to testify.

964
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:30,762
At least that's something.

965
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:37,185
I'm here for an inmate pickup.
Vadim Nezhinski.

966
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,689
-ls he ready?
-Yeah.

967
01:12:41,441 --> 01:12:43,066
They took him 20 minutes ago.

968
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:46,028
-What?
-He complained of chest pains.

969
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,321
They had to take him down
to Elmhurst Hospital.

970
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:49,573
Elmhurst Hospital?

971
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:52,451
Yeah, we had to do it.
It's the law.

972
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:55,996
Give me the phone.

973
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:58,999
You deaf?
Give me the fucking phone!

974
01:12:59,167 --> 01:13:00,625
Hey, what's wrong with you?

975
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:04,379
Thanks for being here.

976
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:09,176
I know it's been really hard.

977
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:17,142
Yeah.

978
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:22,105
Bobby, your brother just called.
We have an emergency.

979
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:25,650
Nezhinski's out. So get your stuff
together, we're moving you.

980
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,319
-What?
-He escaped.

981
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:29,905
They took him to the hospital
with chest pains. He--

982
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:33,492
He had cooperation from the outside.
Our guys got ambushed.

983
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:37,120
Start packing up, sweetheart.
Let's go.

984
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:41,416
Somebody might know this location.
We better get you moved.

985
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:45,378
I'll meet you outside, all right?
Let's go.

986
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,685
The backup should be here
any minute.

987
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:03,271
Probably got held up in the rain.

988
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,441
You all right?

989
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:14,825
-Pop, l'm fucked.
-No, you're not. You'll be okay.

990
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,706
You're never gonna get Nezhinski.

991
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:23,959
Me and Amada
can't take this anymore.

992
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:27,504
-Bobby.
-l don't know what to do.

993
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,715
I'm gonna protect you, all right?

994
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:34,219
I'll make you a promise right now.

995
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:37,055
I'm gonna protect you.

996
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:39,641
Don't worry.

997
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:46,481
It's gonna be okay, son.
We'll see it through.

998
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:50,986
-Chief?
-Yeah.

999
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:53,613
-We have three vehicles on the way.
-Okay.

1000
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:55,073
We'll move them to Corona.

1001
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:56,658
I'll lead the line.

1002
01:14:57,952 --> 01:15:00,162
-Let's go, son.
-Honey.

1003
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,998
You guys stay close behind my car.

1004
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:20,432
There's flooding up ahead.
Watch my brake lights.

1005
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:23,977
It's really coming down.

1006
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:29,316
Vitt, where's the car that's
supposed to be following us?

1007
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:31,902
He should be right behind us,
Bobby.

1008
01:15:32,904 --> 01:15:35,864
Shit, I left the watch you gave me
at the hotel.

1009
01:15:36,324 --> 01:15:38,283
Is that it on the right?

1010
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:42,621
-Vitt!
-Oh, my God!

1011
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,414
Amada, get down! Get down!

1012
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:49,586
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Motherfucker!

1013
01:15:49,754 --> 01:15:51,463
Oh, my God!

1014
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:54,633
What the fuck?!
How'd they find us?

1015
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:58,428
-Amada, stay down!
-Get off, they're shooting.

1016
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,972
Get off the road!

1017
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:03,058
Fuck.

1018
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,273
Fuck!

1019
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:14,444
Get off! Now! I'll take care of them!

1020
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:35,966
Get off the road, Bobby!
Get off the road! Get off!

1021
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,637
You hit? Amada, are you hit?
You hit?

1022
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:43,974
-No! No!
-You hit?

1023
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:55,026
Jesus.

1024
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:17,173
Pop, pull over!

1025
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:19,843
Pull over! Pull over!

1026
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:55,688
You're in a suite at the Sheraton
near Kennedy Airport.

1027
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:58,024
Your brother is here for you.

1028
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,176
I wanted to let you sleep a little bit.

1029
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,053
Where's Pop?

1030
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:30,515
I had to go and identify the body.

1031
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:42,819
I saw him die.

1032
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:46,448
It's all right.
It's gonna be okay, all right?

1033
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:49,200
-l don't wanna be alone.
-l know.

1034
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:51,411
I'm here.

1035
01:19:51,871 --> 01:19:53,371
Now, don't worry, all right?

1036
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:56,541
I'll be ready to come back and
head things up, and we'll get him.

1037
01:19:57,084 --> 01:20:01,129
You just wait till after the funeral.
They're gonna get Nezhinski.

1038
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:03,548
-How did they know where we were?
-lt's all right.

1039
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:06,342
How'd they find us?

1040
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:08,154
Your father was a great man.

1041
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:09,948
Thank you.

1042
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:13,952
He gave me his combat ribbon...

1043
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:16,704
...after we got back from Korea.

1044
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:21,167
I was gonna put it in with him...

1045
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:24,629
...but l think he would have wanted
you to have it now.

1046
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:26,965
Thanks.

1047
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:29,425
It's now in your hands...

1048
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,803
...but we're gonna help you
get Nezhinski.

1049
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,972
And we got a lead, Joe.

1050
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:35,932
Word got back
from one of our uncles...

1051
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:39,394
...that a big Russian shipment's
coming in sometime next week.

1052
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:41,312
We'll find it.

1053
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:44,816
Your father will not
have died in vain.

1054
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:03,835
You're not sleeping again.

1055
01:22:05,546 --> 01:22:08,339
Did you take the pills
the doctor gave you?

1056
01:22:09,091 --> 01:22:10,800
No.

1057
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,265
What is this?

1058
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:30,653
Is this a police exam?

1059
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:38,328
Bobby, is this a police exam?

1060
01:22:39,246 --> 01:22:41,039
Yes.

1061
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:49,213
Were you gonna talk to me
about it?

1062
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:51,799
Yeah.

1063
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:54,177
When?

1064
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:56,888
I don't know.

1065
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:03,895
Bobby, do you know
how this makes me feel?

1066
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:08,775
You just went off,
you made this decision.

1067
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:16,157
You didn't even talk to me about it.

1068
01:23:18,452 --> 01:23:21,913
After this nightmare
we've been through?

1069
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:25,166
I don't know if l could
live through that again.

1070
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,922
You're gonna join
the police, Bobby?

1071
01:23:31,465 --> 01:23:35,009
Baby, you could be killed.
Look at your brother.

1072
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:37,095
Your father, he died for nothing.

1073
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:39,305
No! No!

1074
01:23:39,473 --> 01:23:42,225
Don't talk about them!
You don't talk about them!

1075
01:23:42,393 --> 01:23:45,019
-You wanna get shot like him?
-Don't talk about them!

1076
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:48,564
Do not talk about them!
You don't understand!

1077
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:53,111
You can't do this!
I won't let you!

1078
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:55,279
-No, you can't!
-l have to do this!

1079
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,573
-No, you don't!
-l have to do it!

1080
01:23:57,741 --> 01:24:00,451
No, you're gonna get yourself killed!

1081
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:02,412
I fucking hate you!

1082
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:19,387
The commissioner's aware you have
special knowledge for this case.

1083
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,724
He made it top priority.

1084
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,350
Come.

1085
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:31,649
We're all very sorry
about your father, Robert.

1086
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,986
-Thank you.
-Pursuant to your request...

1087
01:24:35,154 --> 01:24:37,864
...we've decided to grant you
a special dispensation...

1088
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:39,991
...and appoint you
a conditional member...

1089
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:42,577
...of this department,
effective immediately.

1090
01:24:42,745 --> 01:24:44,996
-l appreciate that.
-Good.

1091
01:24:45,164 --> 01:24:49,125
You will be required to go to the
academy once this case is completed.

1092
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:51,961
-You know that?
-Yes, I do.

1093
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:53,671
All right, then.

1094
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:56,924
Would you raise
your right hand, please?

1095
01:24:57,593 --> 01:25:00,803
"I, Robert Green,
hereby pledge and declare...

1096
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:03,973
...that l will support and defend
the Constitution--"

1097
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:07,685
I, Robert Green,
hereby pledge and declare...

1098
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:10,646
...that l will support and defend

"--both of

1100
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:15,526
...and the state of New York,

1101
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:17,528
--both of
the United States government...

1102
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:20,865

1103
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:25,661
"I will faithfully discharge my duties
in the rank of probationary officer--"

1104
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:30,291
I will faithfully discharge my duties
in the rank of probationary officer--

1105
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:32,502
"--in the New York City
Police Department."

1106
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:34,670
--in the New York City
Police Department.

1107
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:38,382
-"So help me God."
-So help me God.

1108
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:41,135
Congratulations, Robert,
and welcome.

1109
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:42,345
Thank you.

1110
01:25:42,513 --> 01:25:44,222
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1111
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:46,641
They're all expecting you
down at the precinct.

1112
01:25:46,809 --> 01:25:51,729
Work all your contacts. We gotta find
out where that deal is going down.

1113
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:54,816
Jumbo, I'm not gonna party,
but I need to talk to you.

1114
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:59,403
All right, so, look, I'll come down later
and l'll see you there. All right.

1115
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:01,739
No, don't tell Freddie.

1116
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:03,574
Jumbo, listen to me.

1117
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:07,036
Just meet me at El Caribe
at 1 1 :30, all right?

1118
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:08,746
All right.

1119
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:10,790
Hey.

1120
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:13,459
You get your lD card this morning?

1121
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:17,338
Yeah, but they wouldn't give me
a piece. l should have one.

1122
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:19,757
I'll get you one.

1123
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:24,178
Pop always said
you were a good shot.

1124
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:31,602
-What's the matter, Joe?
-Nothing.

1125
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:34,605
It's kind of weird seeing you here.

1126
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:40,486
-Yeah, I know.
-Bobby.

1127
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:44,782
I never meant
to get you involved in all this.

1128
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,367
I'm sorry.

1129
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:49,453
You don't gotta apologize to me.

1130
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:53,332
I never listened to you or Pop.

1131
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:57,086
You wanna hear something funny?

1132
01:26:57,546 --> 01:26:59,964
I was kind ofjealous of you for that.

1133
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:04,760
I was. I don't think
I had a lot of faith in myself.

1134
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:07,179
I just did what Pop wanted me to do.

1135
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:11,642
I mean, you....
I mean, you were free.

1136
01:27:15,022 --> 01:27:17,064
Anyway, look...

1137
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:19,775
...l didn't mean to get into all this.
It just....

1138
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:23,654
Maybe it's just because
I ain't been sleeping lately.

1139
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:27,074
I'm kind of having some nightmares
about what happened to me.

1140
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:30,953
Well...

1141
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,920
...all that matters
is that we finish this.

1142
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:42,840
And we catch Nezhinski
when that deal goes down.

1143
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:46,260
Bobby, an Amada Juarez
is calling for you on line three.

1144
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:49,263
-Tell her I'll call her back later.
-All right.

1145
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:53,017
Are you gonna be okay?

1146
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:59,148
I gotta go downstairs and
get fitted for a vest, all right?

1147
01:27:59,316 --> 01:28:00,858
Yeah.

1148
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,839
Amada?

1149
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:26,550
Hey.

1150
01:28:27,094 --> 01:28:30,012
Miss Juarez left about an hour ago.

1151
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:32,264
She said to give you this.

1152
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:41,065
-Hey, get me some food, would you?
-Yeah, sure.

1153
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:44,402
We're checking you out at noon
tomorrow. Get your stuff together.

1154
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:46,570
I'll bring the menus.

1155
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:30,781
Lou.

1156
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:33,743
My brother. The grand return.

1157
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:37,413
I can't believe you called. Look at you.
You look great. You look different.

1158
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:39,582
-Who is this?
-That's my bodyguard.

1159
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:42,793
Look at this place.
You put more tables up here?

1160
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:46,005
No. I don't know. Come here.
Come on, have a drink for a second.

1161
01:29:46,173 --> 01:29:49,633
-Why don't you get us some drinks?
-Don't you think you've had enough?

1162
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:53,220
You wanna be a pain in my ass?
You my mother? Get us some drinks.

1163
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:56,265
-Fuck you in the ass.
-l'm ready.

1164
01:29:56,433 --> 01:29:59,477
-l wanna talk to you about something.
-Sure.

1165
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:04,398
You know of anything going down
the next few days? Something major?

1166
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:06,984
No.

1167
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:10,321
I mean, they never tell me
their heavy stuff anyway.

1168
01:30:10,489 --> 01:30:13,908
Yeah, but you hear about things.
People talking, anything?

1169
01:30:15,786 --> 01:30:18,287
If l hear anything, l'll let you know.

1170
01:30:19,498 --> 01:30:22,166
-What about Freddie? He around?
-Freddie's downstairs.

1171
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:24,668
-Come on, pay attention.
-Where's Amada?

1172
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:29,131
Bob.

1173
01:30:29,299 --> 01:30:31,634
-She left.
-She left?

1174
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:35,012
-What do you mean, she left?
-Jumbo, leave it alone.

1175
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:36,889
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1176
01:30:37,057 --> 01:30:40,017
Amada, she probably
just needs some space.

1177
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:42,186
She'll be back.

1178
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:45,356
Between us, that place they
had you in was driving her crazy...

1179
01:30:45,524 --> 01:30:47,900
...l know that.
The Cue Motor Inn?

1180
01:30:48,068 --> 01:30:51,112
We used to call it the "Screw Motor
Inn," with all the hookers.

1181
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:55,866
How'd you know
where we were staying?

1182
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:03,582
How did you know
where we were staying?

1183
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:08,546
It was in the papers.

1184
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:11,882
You know, those reporters,
they got their noses everywhere.

1185
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:14,385
Always looking through
everybody's garbage.

1186
01:31:14,553 --> 01:31:17,513
Anyway, homeslice,
what do you think of the floorshow?

1187
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:21,058
Wanna go downstairs for a bit?
Go outside? It's loud in here.

1188
01:31:21,226 --> 01:31:23,519
-What?
-Talk, catch up?

1189
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:27,148
You wanna go outside?
We got drinks coming.

1190
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:30,151
Forget the drinks. l haven't
seen you in forever. Let's go.

1191
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:32,611
-lt's cold out.
-Get your coat.

1192
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:35,239
Come on. Give us a few minutes.
It'll be all right.

1193
01:31:35,407 --> 01:31:37,616
Okay, but make it quick.

1194
01:31:55,302 --> 01:31:57,803
It wasn't in the papers, Lou.

1195
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:08,314
Where's Nezhinski?

1196
01:32:08,481 --> 01:32:10,232
I don't know.

1197
01:32:11,401 --> 01:32:13,319
Don't play games with me.

1198
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:18,240
-l don't know.
-l said, don't play games with me.

1199
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:25,247
Amada told you where
we were staying, didn't she?

1200
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:28,709
She trusted you like a brother.

1201
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:31,128
Bob. Come on.

1202
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:34,798
I swear, l don't know nothing.

1203
01:32:41,348 --> 01:32:44,141
My father's dead because of you.

1204
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:47,603
You know I'm with the police now?

1205
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:51,315
And l can do anything to you.

1206
01:32:51,483 --> 01:32:55,527
Bob, l told them where you were,
but it ain't what you think.

1207
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:57,738
Amada said you moved
every couple days.

1208
01:32:57,906 --> 01:33:01,408
I thought you'd be gone by then.
It's the truth. l sw--

1209
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:02,993
I swear to God.

1210
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:06,997
I tried to give them
the wrong information. l tried.

1211
01:33:07,165 --> 01:33:10,251
Come on. Tell me who.

1212
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:13,545
Who? Who? Who?

1213
01:33:16,925 --> 01:33:18,550
Marat.

1214
01:33:18,718 --> 01:33:21,011
Marat Buzhayev.

1215
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:25,474
I'm sorry, Bob. I know
he was like a father to you...

1216
01:33:26,393 --> 01:33:27,643
...but he owns me.

1217
01:33:27,811 --> 01:33:32,189
Don't say that! Don't say that!
Don't say that!

1218
01:33:32,524 --> 01:33:35,192
-My eyes.
-You fuck!

1219
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:39,780
You fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1220
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:42,199
You fuck!

1221
01:33:45,829 --> 01:33:47,538
Get up. Get up!

1222
01:33:49,291 --> 01:33:52,543
Get up! Get up!

1223
01:33:54,421 --> 01:33:56,297
This Jumbo Falsetti guy
confirmed...

1224
01:33:56,464 --> 01:34:00,551
...that a major shipment
is coming tomorrow for Buzhayev.

1225
01:34:01,136 --> 01:34:04,972
He says Buzhayev uses
his grandkids as couriers.

1226
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:08,559
They go everywhere for him. That's
why we weren't able to catch him.

1227
01:34:08,727 --> 01:34:11,729
We should've been putting a tail
on a couple of 1 0-year-olds.

1228
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:14,356
It's unbelievable.
Did Jumbo know the location?

1229
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:18,193
No. No, we tried, believe me.
We interrogated him all night.

1230
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:20,154
He was crying like a 4-year-old.

1231
01:34:20,322 --> 01:34:24,199
But he did say he thought
Nezhinski would be there, though.

1232
01:34:24,367 --> 01:34:26,702
Tomorrow's Tuesday, right?

1233
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:30,414
Buzhayev takes his grandkids to
Floyd Bennett Field every Tuesday.

1234
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:32,916
He takes them horseback riding.

1235
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:35,878
Joe, we should
put our money on that.

1236
01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:39,757
-No, that's not really much to go on.
-You got a better idea?

1237
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:42,217
Anyone?
We can sit on our fucking asses...

1238
01:34:42,385 --> 01:34:44,511
-...or we can crush these--
-Bobby.

1239
01:34:45,055 --> 01:34:47,473
It's a process, you know?

1240
01:34:47,807 --> 01:34:52,394
Look, that's what we got.
I guess that's what we should go with.

1241
01:34:53,897 --> 01:34:55,689
You heard him. Let's go.

1242
01:34:57,317 --> 01:34:59,151
Coats are on the porch.

1243
01:34:59,319 --> 01:35:02,071
Contact ESU. Make sure we don't
come up short, all right?

1244
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:03,906
We got it covered.

1245
01:35:04,074 --> 01:35:06,283
-Sorry about the mess, Sandra.
-lt's all right.

1246
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:09,745
Joe, you know, they're laughing at us
out there on the street.

1247
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:12,498
Now, when we get there,
what we do will be up to you.

1248
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:15,292
But l hope
you drop the hammer on them.

1249
01:35:17,003 --> 01:35:19,129
After your father
and everything else?

1250
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:22,633
I mean, these people
are like fucking lice.

1251
01:35:23,385 --> 01:35:26,387
Just think about
what I'm saying to you.

1252
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:31,100
Joe.

1253
01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:33,894
Joe, you okay?

1254
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:38,023
I hear you, GQ.

1255
01:35:51,037 --> 01:35:54,456
Take that, all right?
It's one of Pop's.

1256
01:35:58,002 --> 01:36:01,213
I don't need any more guns in my life,
that's for sure.

1257
01:36:01,381 --> 01:36:03,841
But you should have one to be safe.

1258
01:36:04,843 --> 01:36:08,387
It's better to be judged by 1 2
than carried by six.

1259
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:44,608
Joe, we're all ready.
What's the move?

1260
01:37:44,776 --> 01:37:46,568
Wait till they complete the sale.

1261
01:37:46,736 --> 01:37:48,904
Then we move.
ESU will grab the kids.

1262
01:37:53,785 --> 01:37:56,620
They're so fucking close,
the two of them.

1263
01:38:34,242 --> 01:38:37,160
This is what
we've wanted for so long.

1264
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:41,915
My nephew has stayed
just to see this through.

1265
01:38:43,918 --> 01:38:46,211
When this is done...

1266
01:38:46,629 --> 01:38:49,339
...we'll control
almost the whole market.

1267
01:38:51,259 --> 01:38:53,760
Each load is completely untraceable.

1268
01:38:57,307 --> 01:39:00,183
It's my own method.

1269
01:39:01,811 --> 01:39:02,853
Impressive.

1270
01:39:03,563 --> 01:39:08,275
You put the drugs right on the coat.

1271
01:39:08,610 --> 01:39:12,029
We are importing 200 imitation sables
per week.

1272
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:43,060
Try it.

1273
01:39:50,109 --> 01:39:52,194
Very good. Give them the money.

1274
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:58,241
All right, deal's about to close.
Let's go.

1275
01:39:58,409 --> 01:40:01,328
This is the police! Drop your weapons.
Come out!

1276
01:40:01,496 --> 01:40:03,038
Police! Put your weapons down!

1277
01:40:03,373 --> 01:40:05,082
They're firing at us.
Everybody down!

1278
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:07,125
Eli! The kids!

1279
01:40:12,131 --> 01:40:15,050
Get down! Joseph! Get down!

1280
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:18,553
Joe! Joe, are you hit?

1281
01:40:19,013 --> 01:40:21,890
-What happened?
-He's okay. He's okay.

1282
01:40:23,309 --> 01:40:25,018
He's all right. He ain't hit.

1283
01:40:25,186 --> 01:40:27,562
-Should we move?
-l don't know what's wrong.

1284
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:29,898
-Bobby. Bobby, take his shotgun.
-Okay.

1285
01:40:30,066 --> 01:40:32,275
-l'll stay here with him.
-Go, go, go!

1286
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:45,330
Run!

1287
01:40:45,498 --> 01:40:47,416
We got runners out the back!

1288
01:40:54,757 --> 01:40:57,217
-lt's okay.
-Come with me.

1289
01:40:57,385 --> 01:40:58,427
Keep going! Go! Go!

1290
01:40:58,594 --> 01:40:59,928
-Watch your back!
-Go! Go!

1291
01:41:00,096 --> 01:41:02,347
Kelly, we're gonna move to the left!
Let's go.

1292
01:41:02,515 --> 01:41:03,932
Okay.

1293
01:41:09,605 --> 01:41:11,773
Halt! Police!

1294
01:42:01,449 --> 01:42:03,950
Freeze. Hold it right there.

1295
01:42:29,519 --> 01:42:32,437
All right. Fuck!

1296
01:42:34,315 --> 01:42:36,775
We'll kill each other in here.

1297
01:42:36,943 --> 01:42:38,944
Nezhinski's in here with us.

1298
01:42:39,111 --> 01:42:41,238
Let's smoke him out.

1299
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:44,074
Radio our guys.
Tell them to clear out.

1300
01:42:44,242 --> 01:42:45,951
Absolutely.

1301
01:42:47,036 --> 01:42:50,038
We got the old man.
We got Buzhayev.

1302
01:42:50,206 --> 01:42:52,833
All right, guys. Clear out.

1303
01:42:53,918 --> 01:42:56,253
Go on. lnto the clearing.

1304
01:43:33,291 --> 01:43:35,417
Bobby!

1305
01:43:35,585 --> 01:43:37,586
Bobby, what are you doing?

1306
01:43:39,046 --> 01:43:40,463
Bobby!

1307
01:43:42,174 --> 01:43:45,343
Don't go in there.
We have Vadim surrounded.

1308
01:43:45,511 --> 01:43:49,431
Be patient, he'll come out! Bobby!

1309
01:43:53,811 --> 01:43:59,983
Bobby!

1310
01:44:46,322 --> 01:44:47,989
Bobby...

1311
01:44:49,367 --> 01:44:51,201
...fuck you.

1312
01:45:58,602 --> 01:46:00,645
Bobby...

1313
01:46:00,813 --> 01:46:03,898
...l didn't know
it would be your family.

1314
01:46:06,819 --> 01:46:09,070
Get on your knees.

1315
01:46:32,136 --> 01:46:33,803
We're done here.

1316
01:47:40,788 --> 01:47:41,830
Hey, Joe.

1317
01:47:41,997 --> 01:47:43,832
-Can't believe how nervous l am.
-Bobby.

1318
01:47:43,999 --> 01:47:45,208
-Big day.
-Look at you.

1319
01:47:45,376 --> 01:47:48,128
All dressed up, huh?
Looking like a chief.

1320
01:47:48,295 --> 01:47:50,547
I don't know about that.
Maybe a lieutenant.

1321
01:47:50,714 --> 01:47:52,382
-You look good.
-Captain?

1322
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:55,135
Hey, Joe, l got through
to McClennan at Personnel.

1323
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:57,137
He's still holding that slot for you...

1324
01:47:57,304 --> 01:47:59,848
...if you're ready
to switch to administration.

1325
01:48:00,015 --> 01:48:02,142
Yeah, can we talk about it
another time?

1326
01:48:02,935 --> 01:48:04,018
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

1327
01:48:04,353 --> 01:48:07,230
-Hey, good luck.
-All right.

1328
01:48:07,773 --> 01:48:09,649
Now, what's this?

1329
01:48:11,026 --> 01:48:13,778
Look, l meant to tell you.

1330
01:48:14,155 --> 01:48:17,782
I gotta start doing the right thing.
I gotta spend more time at home.

1331
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:20,201
I got three kids now.
What am I supposed to do?

1332
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:23,788
Look, l was gonna
talk to you about it.

1333
01:48:24,748 --> 01:48:27,041
Do what you need to do.

1334
