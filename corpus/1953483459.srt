Well the weird weather continues.

we can expect some
chilly, gusty winds.

We've got toilets tying up traffic.

Oh, hi Paula.

30
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,917
Could you tell him I'm
gonna be a few minutes late?

31
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,418
No, no, I know he's a big baby,

32
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,622
but he's also the cow that
keeps our cash clock ticking.

33
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,324
Alright, we lose him and we all
go back to living in the dorms.

34
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,760
Alright. No, no, no, I'm fine.

35

Uh-huh.

37
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:29,601
Just keep him there because he's

Finally! I was like this
close to giving him a foot rub.

43
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,709
Also, your brother called like ten times!

44
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,311
What are you wearing?

45
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,646
Christmas gift. He made me wear it.

46
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,014
You don't have to wear that.

47
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,316
What did my brother want?

48
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,984
He wouldn't say. He was talking so fast.

49
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,654
Something about the end
is near, or beer, or here.

50
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,189
The end is beer! Could that be it?

51
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,192
No, no, no.
It's Armageddon again. Perfect.

52

off that I could find for you, trust me,

I'm sorry Martin, but your brother
absolutely will not take no for an answer.

89

Everybody knows it.

You have become a very scary guy, Sam!

When you can't see he's
yanking your chain like usual.

177
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,206
Let me smell your breath...

178
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,774
Let me smell your breath.

179
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,277
Seriously, there's something
really stinky floating around here.

180
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,212
[Martin chuckles sarcastically]

181
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,947
[LU]
I wasn't drinking!

182
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,549
Hello! Father come in!

183
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,050
I don't drink! Gross!

184
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,052
Oh yeah, well, then how
come the cops arrested you?

185
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,756
First of all, I wasn't arrested.
I was escorted here.

186
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,392
Second of all, it wasn't the police.

187
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,727
Okay. Go on.

188
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,295
Are you sure you can handle it?

189
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,230
Bring it.

190
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,231
<i>Regis and I...</i>

191
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,468
Oh God, Regis, is that the
hairy guy with the tattoos?

192
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,570
You know what, forget it.

193
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,738
Can we just go home?

194
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,907
You're not listening, and as
usual, you're not here.

195
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,582
I am here. Please continue.

196
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,747
Fine!

197
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,484
Regis, not sure where the hairy thing
comes in, my boyfriend of three months,

198
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,619
who by the way you've
met at least five times,

199
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,922
were hanging out at the mall and
a couple of the kids had some beers.

200
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,459
So then this mall cop named
Bob shows up, and the kids

201
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,330
who actually had the beers bolt, leaving
Regis and I holding the bag. Not cool!

202
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,464
I agree

203
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,934
So then he says he has to deliver
me to a parent or legal guardian.

204
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,971
He takes me home first. Only
when we get there, Mom's not there.

205
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,506
Yeah, what else is new?

206
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,776
So then I try calling you,
and you don't answer your cell.

207
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,277
What else is new?

208
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:04,015
So he's left with no choice but to drop me
off here to Uncle Sam's farmhouse of freaks.

209
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,451
You know if I had my own car, none of
this would have happened by the way.

210
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,320
[Martin breathes in and exhales]

211
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,302
Save some air for the rest of us papa bear

212
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,166
Hey! Where': your mother?

213
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,702
I'm not her social secretary.

214
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,671
So, do I get my phone back or not?

215
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,040
Ha ha, you think?

216
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:02,841
[Lu scoffs in frustration]

217
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,342
[Lu] So lame.

218
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,913
[door closes]

219
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,238
[water dripping]

220
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,723
[television playing in background]

221
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,726
Kids! I'm home!

222
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,731
[television playing in background]

223
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,441
Jessie?

224
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,814
[Martin]
Jessie? You didn't hear me?

225
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,740
And this is where Jonah
surrendered to God': will.

226
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:17,978
For three days and three nights,
he prayed to God to forgive him of his sins...

227
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,487
[Jessie]
Tina says it hurts.

228
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,490
[Jessie]
Lights please!

229
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:29,761
[Pastor] And that's where he
started his journey to Nineveh...

230
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,096
You have a kiss for Daddy?

231
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:36,935
[Pastor] ...and Jonah spoke to those
barbarians, and to his amazement,

232
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,771
they listened!

233
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:46,121
[Pastor] And they followed Jonah.
And together they learned the love of God.

234
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,783
Tina says we were rude,
and you can turn the lights back on.

235
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,195
[Martin]
Okay.

236
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,126
So, what did you and, uh,
Tina do today?

237
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,162
Watched TV.

238
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:08,633
[Jessie] Santa from the mall was on
the news, but the police took him away.

239
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:13,634
[Jessie] He looked skinny.
Tina says he was a fake one.

240
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:18,676
I told her we shouldn't watch
so much TV, but she likes it.

241
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,679
Especially church TV.

242
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:27,385
Did we ever go to church?
Real church?

243
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,154
Well... <i>yeah...</i> before you were born.

244
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,191
Did you marry Mommy in a church?

245
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,671
I did.

246
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:40,665
Tina wants to know why we stopped
going to church after I was born.

247
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:45,370
Well, we, uh...
got kind of busy with stuff.

248
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,375
We got too busy to go to church?

249
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,414
Have you and Tina had dinner?

250
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,247
And where is your brother?

251
00:16:56,248 --> 00:17:01,357
[Jessie] He's keeping an eye on me.
Like God does.

252
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,565
Okay.

253
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,603
[Martin]
Hey buddy!

254
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,210
[Martin]
Adam!

255
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,874
[Martin]
Hi Dad.

256
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,723
[Martin]
Right.

257
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,749
Hey, I was going to make a little
dinner downstairs.You hungry?

258
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,593
[digital beeps]

259
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,266
[Jessie] When are Splatter's
puppies gonna come?

260
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,935
I don't know. Soon.

261
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:54,076
I just hope someone':
home when they do.

262
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,477
[Jessie]
Here ya go...

263
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,245
I thought you love franks and beans.

264
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,749
Splatter loves franks and beans.

265
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,920
Oh. Well, what do you like to eat then?

266
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,321
Cereal.

267
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,824
Yeah, yeah.
You can't have cereal for dinner.

268
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,492
What about Tina?

269
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,094
Oh, you definitely
can't have Tina for dinner.

270
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,097
[Martin laughs]

271
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,803
I think you upset her.

272
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:26,838
[door closes]

273
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,672
[Jackie]
Hey guys!

274
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:28,639
Mommy!

275
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,608
[Jackie]
Hey!

276
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,010
Oh, you and Tina didn't
feel like pizza baby?

277
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,178
What pizza?

278
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,115
The pizza I told Lu to order.
I gave her money this morning.

279
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,283
She spent it on booze
for her boyfriend.

280
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,284
[Jackie chuckles under her breath]

281
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,120
Exaggeration voice Martin.

282
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,489
I talked to her.
Wrong place, wrong time.

283
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,157
We have all been there.

284
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,626
I am not going to get
into this with you. Come on!

285
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,295
Let's go get a Christmas tree.
Now, before Christmas actually happens.

286
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,674
[Jackie] Come on...
Come on kids! Christmas tree!

287
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,811
You know a toilet fell on me today?

288
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,675
[Splatter whines]

289
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,680
J' sleigh bells lead into Christmas song J'

290
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,009
That one!That one!
Tina likes that one!

291
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,677
[Tree salesman laughs]

292
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,581
Tina says he's
not the real Santa either.

293
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:44,682
How about this one?

294
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,851
It's eight foot six.
Perfect for a nine foot ceiling

295
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,686
Great. Let's grab it and go.

296
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,521
Oh, no, no, no! Not so fast!

297
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,889
The girl made a fine choice there.

298
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,357
That's the best tree in the lot.

299
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,193
Come on! Show me the good stuff!

300
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,195
Martin, let's not make a big deal.

301
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,229
All these trees are beautiful.

302
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,931
It doesn't smell! Smell it!

303
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,365
That's a good tree!

304
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,368
Yeah, burn it! It's firewood!

305
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,244
Yeah, for munchkins maybe.

306
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,918
<i>Oh...</i>

307
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,281
Now, that': a tree!

308
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:21,287
[chainsaw buzz]

309
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,262
[Martin] You know, everything the
kids do is part of some glorious,

310
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,065
normal developmental phase with you.

311
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,467
I mean, Jessie': in her pajamas every day.

312
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:39,403
The same ones, morning, noon, and night.

313
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,572
Well, when she wants to
wear something else, she will.

314
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,741
And what's up with
this whole church TV thing?

315
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,610
Where'd that come
from all the sudden?

316
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,812
[Jackie says chuckling]
I put my money on Tina.

317
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,480
Oh yeah, well and her!

318
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,482
Jessie freaks out that
I don't want to give her doll,

319
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,619
Tina, a birthday party
and then what do I do?

320
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,653
I cave!

321
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,788
[Jackie]
Oh, it was sweet.

322
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,590
Oh yeah, it's
preposterous is what it is.

323
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:04,591
$413.16.Thinking of
claiming her as a dependent.

324
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,631
[Jackie]
Oh, there': my accountant.

325
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,099
Always looking for a write-off.

326
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,101
Oh, and Adam, his voice could
have changed by now and I wouldn't

327
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,837
know it because you got to make an
appointment with his door to talk to him.

328
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,438
You buy him the stuff.

329
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,440
Look on the bright side, Babe.
At least he can spell.

330
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,775
You know he invented a little camera.

331
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,510
He's going around and spying on us.

332
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,945
[Jackie]
Oh, it's just a toy.

333
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,947
It's pretty ingenious if you ask me.

334
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,849
I think every family can use a MacGyver.

335
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,184
Speaking of which, Babe,
you've got to fix that shower.

336
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,786
I need my shower fixed

337
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,822
It's weird, the whole spying thing.

338
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:35,159
[Jackie] Look, if you don't like what
you see, do something about it.

339
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,995
Just, you know, take some
responsibility. Take control.

340
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,797
Uh, take control.

341
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,165
Again. Everybody keeps
telling me to take control.

342
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,700
What does that even mean?

343
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,702
Martin, try connecting
with your children.

344
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:45,803
How? What do you want me to do?

345
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,973
Skype them? Text them?
Tweet them? I work!

346
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,675
[Jackie]
Oh, here we go.

347
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,644
So do I Martin, raising our children!

348
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,845
[Jackie]
What's with all the classes?

349
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,647
I mean, what did you take this week?

350
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:01,152
Was it ceramics? Dance?
Kung Fu and interpretive baking?

351
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,520
What was it tonight?

352
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:06,824
I've told you, several times, and
as usual, you never pay attention.

353
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:11,495
Uh, oh, I pay attention.
People pay me to pay attention.

354
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,164
Well then, you should know!

355
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,399
All in all, Lu,
she's a pretty good kid.

356
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,402
Try cutting her some slack.

357
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,675
Lights please.

358
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,678
[Martin sighs and sarcastically chuckles]

359
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:35,386
[Christmas tree talks]
Hey!You destroyed me.

360
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,389
You were too tall.

361
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,790
[television playing in background]

362
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:16,066
And Jonah was snatched by
a great whale, into the belly.

363
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:22,233
And this is where Jonah
surrendered to God': will.

364
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:27,234
For three days and three nights he
prayed to God to forgive him of his sins.

365
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:33,312
And on the third day, that
great whale released Jonah...

366
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,587
[military music]

367
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:48,125
[Drill Sergeant] Warning! A cataclysmic
disaster is just around the corner.

368
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,834
Prepare yourself. Act now!

369
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:55,266
It doesn't take a genius to
realize that with each passing day,

370
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:59,770
we give up one more piece
of control in our daily lives.

371
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,807
[Drill Sergeant]
We've become slaves to technology.

372
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:07,178
And worst of all, our children,
our future, are unmotivated...

373
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,682
Their morals eroding
in the face of uncertainty.

374
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,951
They hopelessly walk
the streets like zombies.

375
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,953
Passing through a
data mushroom cloud...

376
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,789
Speaking a language
we no longer understand.

377
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,135
But rest assured,
there is one last sliver of hope.

378
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,297
[with echo effect]
The 3 Day Test.

379
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:30,634
An exercise that not only challenges
your ability to survive disaster,

380
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:34,472
but gives you and your loved
ones the opportunity to reconnect

381
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:39,343
and rediscover hope and
the meaning of family together.

382
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:40,978
The ground rules are simple.

383
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:45,649
Without discussion, turn off every utility
and service coming into your house.

384
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:50,650
Water, power, gas, phone,
cable, satellite... All of it.

385
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,557
Collect the cell phones.

386
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,392
Lock the windows.
Lock the doors.

387
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:59,163
No one in, no one out for 72 hours.

388
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,333
That is three full days.

389
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,169
The world outside no longer exists.

390
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,172
You're gonna want to spring
this on you family without warning...

391
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:13,173
...and at the most inappropriate time,
as that is how true emergencies develop.

392
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:18,082
[Drill Sergeant]
Now is the time to make that choice!

393
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,018
Take it or be taken!

394
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,353
Eat or be eaten Martin!

395
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,925
Be scary or be scared.

396
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,727
You had me at cataclysmic pal!

397
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,730
Alright then! Let's get started!

398
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:36,702
J' "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"
by Pyotr llyich Tchaikovsky J'

399
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,114
[objects falling]

400
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,560
[Martin]
Owl!

401
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,623
Tweet that!

402
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,634
[Martin]
Okay... let's see here.

403
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,801
Huh.

404
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:21,805
[spraying sound]
J' uptempo Christmas music J'

405
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:26,176
[Ms.Wilburn] What in the who hey
are you doing now, Taylor?

406
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:29,146
Good morning, Ms. Wilburn.

407
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,016
[Martin] You can crawl back in
your hole.The world is over.

408
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,851
What's this?

409
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,386
Looks like a candy cane to me.

410
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,021
I know what it is ding dong.

411
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:40,524
It's my candy cane.
How did it get on your lawn?

412
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,159
Ah, beats me.

413
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,661
I just might.

414
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,396
Just because we share the same street...

415
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,064
...doesn't mean we share our lives.

416
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,511
I understand Ms. Wilburn.

417
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,024
Jessie!

418
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:06,583
Lu! Adam! Jackie! Everybody up!

419
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:11,584
Let's go! Let's go!
Everybody! Everybody!

420
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,059
Move it! Move it!
Move it! Move it!

421
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,864
The world as we know it is over.

422
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,066
This is a test.

423
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,701
A test? What?
What are you talking about?

424
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,869
A test of survival. Boom!

425
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,603
Sam!

426
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:27,705
Been there. Seen that.

427
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,040
Not that interested. Boom! Bye.

428
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,875
Stay!

429
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:35,212
[Martin] Alright, for the next
three days, time has stopped.

430
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,281
Everything that we've
come to depend on is gone.

431
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,550
No water. No power. No heat.

432
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,951
Are you out of your mind?

433
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,553
Yes! I'm out of my mind!

434
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,888
I'm off the hook!
Speaking of which, no phones!

435
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:45,756
What?

436
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:46,123
<i>Yeah...</i>

437
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,892
No one goes in this house,
no one leaves this house

438
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,429
for three days and three
nights. 72 hours.

439
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,631
It's freezing in here.
What happened to the heat?

440
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:55,566
The heat is off.

441
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,946
If we don't make it
in here, it doesn't exist.

442
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:03,107
What happened to our windows?

443
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,775
Blacked out!

444
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:07,144
The cruel world stays outside.

445
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,145
[Martin maniacally laughs]

446
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,581
We stay inside!

447
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,416
You painted our windows black?

448
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,283
Yeah!

449
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,786
He's lost it. Happened to Cara': dad.

450
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:19,590
Moved the whole family to North
Dakota to build canoes from scratch.

451
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,992
We're going to build a canoe?

452
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,128
Okay, Honey.
This is about last night, right?

453
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,996
Fine, you've made your point, okay?

454
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,298
Now turn on the heat.
I'll make some pancakes.We can--

455
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,968
No, no, now, wait, wait!
This is about the last seventeen years.

456
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:34,271
This is...This is about finding us again.

457
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,274
I want my family back.

458
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:02,633
You sure this is where
the toilet dude lives?

459
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,968
Absolutely.

460
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,503
That's pretty weird, huh?

461
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,006
Maybe it hit him a
little harder than we thought.

462
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,809
Yeah, apparently.
I smell a bigger deal here.

463
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,210
You know what? I hope so!

464
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:16,980
I truly hope so, because my parents didn't
spend 100 grand to put me through college

465
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,150
for a "man gets hit by port-a-potty"
topping our news today.

466
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,819
George, George, chill man.

467
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,820
My momma would whoop me...

468
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,654
[Tom]
I know. George!

469
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,721
That doesn't feel good.

470
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,056
Cool, cool, alright man.

471
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,158
What else you got on this guy?

472
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,993
Says here the guy's an accountant.

473
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,167
His firm does taxes.

474
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,200
That sounds totally...

475
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,334
...stressful.

476
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,703
Okay, we're going to be warmer
sleeping together in the living room.

477
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:42,506
We'd be warmer if
you turned on the heat.

478
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,341
You think you're free don't you?

479
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,175
I guess.

480
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,344
Well, you're not.You're a slave.

481
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,680
To all that stuff in your room.

482
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,082
The oil that heats
the house, drives your car...

483
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,017
I don't drive dad.

484
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,686
Alright, where's all the camping gear?

485
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,520
Up in the attic?

486
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,021
I'm on it!

487
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,690
Would that be the ton of
camping gear you bought for

488
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,725
the trip to Yellowstone
that never happened there, Yogi?

489
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:04,595
We got too busy to go camping.

490
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:05,929
Martin, it's freezing.

491
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:10,100
Yeah, well, layers.
It's survival not yoga,Yogi.

492
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:12,274
Get in here! Now!

493
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,539
Take off that stupid hat.

494
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,542
You know, you lose 30% of
your body heat through your head!

495
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,244
I'm not doing this Martin!

496
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,746
It's Christmas!
You have us locked in our house.

497
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:23,947
This has Sam written all over it!

498
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,884
This is me taking control!

499
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,720
He said it, you say it,
everyone says it.

500
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,897
Now I'm doing it.
I gotta do this now Jackie!

501
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,262
Just say, "I love you, Martin."

502
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:42,799
Of course, I love you, but right now,
I want to get dressed.

503
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,436
I want to go get a latte. Do some
Christmas shopping. It's Christmas.

504
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,071
I used to love Christmas.

505
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,108
Remember? We'd sit around the fire.
We would read stories to the kids.

506
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:55,279
Lu would sing in the Christmas
choir in that cute little red velvet dress.

507
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,649
You remember all that?
And now she's going to college.

508
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,755
[Martin]
Where did it go?

509
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,590
Now Christmas is just another excuse
for everyone to melt their credit cards,

510
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:10,494
go further into debt,
and then expect me to fix it.

511
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,262
[Martin]
Well I say no!

512
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,666
No more shopping! No more showers!
No more lattes!

513
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:19,603
No more "connectivity,"
unless it's in person, under this roof.

514
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,506
I'm taking a stand!
We're unplugging from this lunacy!

515
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:25,954
No, Martin!
You're plugging right into it!

516
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,847
Kids, get dressed! We're going out!

517
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,116
Jackie, I really need this.

518
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,685
We need this!

519
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,954
I can't do this for you Martin.

520
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,523
It's Christmas, and this is nuts.

521
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:42,659
This is just you and Sam,
doing the same old thing.

522
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,161
So get over it! Okay?

523
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:47,166
I'm done with this! It is crazy!

524
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,641
Put that stuff down. We're going out.

525
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,687
What do you two
bozos think you're doing?

526
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,356
[Tom]We're here to
do a story on your neighbor.

527
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,991
Why? He's an idiot.

528
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,993
Construction toilet
fell on him yesterday.

529
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,495
We're here to ask him the
question everyone wants to know.

530
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,331
What's it feel like to get hit by a toilet?

531
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:26,069
Well, you'd better hurry then because
I've just called the cops on him.

532
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,170
Why?

533
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,243
I think he's got his
family hostage in there.

534
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,083
Jessie, go find your brother and sister
and tell them we are leaving now.

535
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,086
With or without them.

536
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,224
[Martin]
You know...

537
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:50,927
I haven't asked for anything
in seventeen years.

538
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:54,064
Three days is all I ask.
Is that so much to ask?

539
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:57,234
Yes.You want to
lock yourself in here, fine!

540
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,869
I've already done it.

541
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,705
[Jackie] My friends have careers.
I have carpools.

542
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,709
They talk business. I can't form a
sentence that doesn't end in pee-pee.

543
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,445
You know, you want to do
something really constructive,

544
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,615
use those tools you have
on display in the garage

545
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:15,052
to fix the drain in the shower
before the ceiling caves in.

546
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,420
I could've had a plumber
do it six months ago,

547
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:21,058
but no, you wanted to save
the $538.42 by doing it yourself.

548
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,393
Well now, it's double that and counting!

549
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,895
Jackie, do you know what I am?

550
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,930
I am a bean counter. Okay?

551
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,900
Day in, day out I account
for other people's lives.

552
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,902
I never take the time to account for ours.

553
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,471
And whose fault is that?

554
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:35,739
Mine.

555
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,076
We live in a nice house, in a nice
neighborhood, in a nice block.

556
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,311
We've got the whole package,
but what do we really know?

557
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:44,281
Seriously, what do we
really know about anything?

558
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,617
How, socks get made.

559
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:48,752
Ask Kara': dad.

560
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,757
I'm sure he can knit
you a pair between canoes.

561
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,293
[Martin]
Come on, Seriously?

562
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,662
[Martin]
We take so much for granted.

563
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:02,299
What if the world as
we know it did end suddenly?

564
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,267
Are we ready?

565
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,603
What if Sam's right?

566
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,306
What if Armageddon is a coming?

567
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,475
[Jackie]
Martin, stop! Really!

568
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:14,945
Besides, I'm pretty sure
that's God': call, not Sam's.

569
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,147
Uh, Jackie, we kind of need the water,
so you might not want to...

570
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,788
[toilet flushes]

571
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,491
The power': out.

572
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:28,994
Uh, Martin!

573
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,661
Jessie, get in the car please.

574
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:32,829
Lu, could you open the door?

575
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,298
What, with like my hands?

576
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,677
Never mind. I got it.

577
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,482
[I-ll]
This is so lame.

578
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,720
[screeching tires]

579
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,361
[police sirens]

580
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,205
[Merrick]
Martin Taylor!

581
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:18,008
[Merrick] Please come out the
front door with your hands up!

582
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,011
You are surrounded.

583
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,716
What?

584
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:57,914
Drop your weapon.

585
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:58,782
What?

586
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,584
The frying pan, Martin!

587
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,552
Oh, right.

588
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,121
[S.W.A.T. members] Get on the
ground now! Get down! Get down!

589
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:07,124
[Jessie screams]

590
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,730
Hello network news!

591
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,732
[Merrick]
Okay guys, up!

592
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,235
[Martin]
I'm swallowing lawn.

593
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,569
Are you Martin Taylor?

594
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,804
Yeah.

595
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,072
You know why we're here?

596
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,273
No.

597
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,809
Were you holding your family
hostage inside your house?

598
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,409
[Jackie]
Huh?

599
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,143
No.

600
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:28,912
We have reason to believe you were.

601
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,413
Well, you heard wrong.

602
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,615
Ma'am, please back off.

603
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,583
No, you back off! Get off him now!

604
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,619
Ma'am! I'm gonna
ask you straight out.

605
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,653
Was your husband holding you

606
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:40,966
or any member of your family
against your will inside that house?

607
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:44,494
Well if you...

608
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:45,495
Jackie!

609
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:47,797
I'm kidding. No, no,
of course not! That's ridiculous.

610
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:50,934
Ma'am, now': the time for truth.

611
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,470
Kids, get over here.

612
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,438
The rest of you, back off!

613
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,274
This is private property!

614
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,810
I don't know what you think is going
on here, but you are mistaken.

615
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,179
Just move it! Now! All of you!

616
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,983
Who? Who said I was
holding my family hostage?

617
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:07,684
[Merrick]
Look...

618
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,687
Who? Who was it?

619
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,623
Clearly, there's been a little mix up.

620
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,959
Oh, a little mix up?
Is that what this is, a little mix up?

621
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,160
[Martin]
Well, this is not over!

622
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,963
I'm an accountant and I know
people who know people.

623
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,331
Martin.

624
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:25,135
Down boy! Listen, please
just take your guns and your

625
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,137
big toys with all the flashing
lights and just go home.

626
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,638
[Jackie]
Okay? We'll call it even.

627
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,342
You heard the lady, go home!

628
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:35,812
Shows over! Go back in
your houses! Eat or be eaten!

629
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,657
Seriously! Calm down!

630
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,685
[Tom]
Hey dude...!

631
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:45,532
How's it feel to get hit
by a toilet falling from the sky?

632
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,164
[clock ticking]

633
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,046
Jonah made it three days in a
whale': belly without power and stuff.

634
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:09,857
Okay.

635
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:12,415
You got three days.

636
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,692
What...? Are you kidding?

637
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:17,754
Three days, Martin.

638
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,723
You want your family back?

639
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:22,525
Hop in the belly, here we are.

640
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,860
Hop in the belly? A whale?

641
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:27,063
Am I like totally
missing something here?

642
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:29,032
Are you serious?

643
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:33,570
Since we can't go Christmas shopping,
consider this my Christmas gift to you.

644
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:38,541
Seriously, we don't have any gifts.
We have no gifts this Christmas.

645
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,377
That kind of stinks!

646
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,544
[Martin]
Thank you...

647
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,549
Thank you, thank you! Thank you.

648
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:54,234
Alright. I'm going to go make breakfast...
without water, power, or gas.

649
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,800
Gum;

650
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:03,139
Alright, so what do
you think? We hang?

651
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:14,951
Oh yeah.We hang.
We most definitely hang.

652
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,949
Candles?

653
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,084
Check!

654
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,754
Check. Flashlights and lanterns?

655
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,657
<i>Uh, check!</i>

656
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:31,327
Check. Uh, you know, Adam, when the
power runs out on that thing, that's it, right?

657
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:35,333
Don't worry dad.
You do it your way. I'll do it mine.

658
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,600
You know we might need to start thinking
about rationing the chow. Just for...

659
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,975
[Jackie] We have food Martin.
Not tons, but enough.

660
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:48,311
I can make food. See.

661
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:49,612
We can't eat clay dumbo.

662
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,947
Tina does. Dumbo!

663
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,449
Tina's a doll moron!

664
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,984
[Jessie] She is not, and you
are whatever you just said!

665
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:56,319
--[Adam] Oh yeah!

666
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,653
--[Jessie screams]
--[Adam] Oh yeah!

667
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,521
--[Jessie screams]
--Enough guys!

668
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,657
Hmm, how do you like it so far?

669
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,292
<i>[I-ll]
So lame...</i>

670
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,829
Oh, FYI, there's no water in the downstairs
toilet, if that's where you're headed.

671
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,964
You can thank your mother for that

672
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:12,965
The average toilet tank in every older
home holds about three gallons of water.

673
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:17,173
Unflushed toilet water. We've got two
bathrooms. That's two times three. That's six.

674
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,174
We're here for three days...

675
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,342
Wait, we're drinking toilet water?

676
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:20,643
[All]
Eww.

677
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,811
Is that even healthy?

678
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,480
[Martin]
Tank water! It's fine.

679
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,516
Necessity is the mother of
invention.Alright?

680
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:30,153
[Martin]
Next is firewood! Firewood.

681
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,821
[Adam] I don't think we
have any outside either.

682
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,656
You could always burn that pamphlet.

683
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,228
Now, that's funny Lu,
but that means you're thinking.

684
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:42,171
See. Burn furniture.

685
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,175
Hmm?

686
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,714
Oh, no, no, no you don't.
No you don't! No you don't!

687
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,699
Hey!

688
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,725
[Martin]
Ah, no, that': Lu's changing table.

689
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:11,060
Nah, no, not ready, no way.

690
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:13,563
Honey, she's out of diapers.
She's going to college next year.

691
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:15,202
No, not yet.

692
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:20,036
Grandpa': desk. I can't.

693
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,205
Oh, you can. Yeah, that': hideous.

694
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:27,212
I'm freezing and, uh... Grandpa, God rest
his soul, is going to keep us warm.

695
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,423
[clock ticking]

696
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,072
[clock suddenly stops ticking]

697
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,236
[Lu] Look, the clock is dead.

698
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,238
Some strange ironic act of fate.

699
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,575
The Taylor family killed time
on the way to killing themselves

700
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,911
Oh, I like that Lu.Very clever!

701
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:06,416
Look at the bright side, at least we'll look
like runway models on our way to starvation.

702
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,118
Yeah, if the hypothermia doesn't get us first.

703
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,987
I've got a great idea.

704
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,156
How about we decorate
that Christmas tree?

705
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:14,657
Ornaments are in the attic.
I'm on it.

706
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:16,125
No, no, no, no, no! A better idea.

707
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:19,829
[Martin] We make our own ornaments from
stuff that's lying around the house.

708
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,599
Maybe like Jessie's art supplies.
That's a cool idea.

709
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,501
So cool, give me my
phone so I can tweet it!

710
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,437
Paper angels!

711
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,938
Oh, that's a great idea.

712
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,441
There's our angel!

713
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:36,312
We make stars made out of aluminum
foil, and strings of cranberry and popcorn...

714
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:40,116
Ooh, which of course we'll get from our
cranberry and popcorn tree in our kitchen.

715
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,118
[Martin] Come on team!
Where's your Christmas spirit?

716
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,953
You think they used to
make Christmas decorations

717
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:47,123
out of old cheap
ornaments and tacky tinsel?

718
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,660
No! They made their own!
They made their own Christmas!

719
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,630
They went out and chopped down
the tree and caught a wild turkey.

720
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:58,468
And at night, they would dream about
microwaves and iPods and a cure for smallpox.

721
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,370
Tina likes this idea.

722
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:04,007
Good. Enough said.Tina has spoken.

723
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:07,310
J' uptempo seasonal music J'

724
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:11,714
You're going to burn
down the house, Martin.

725
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,316
It's lit!

726
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,652
Tina wants to know if we're
going to burn the house down.

727
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,657
If it does, are we
allowed to leave?

728
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:29,065
[Jackie]
I think the tree has spoken.

729
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,603
[Tom] Ok... so check it out.
How'bout this for a reality show?

730
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,737
So check it out.

731
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,839
You take like ten
smokin'super models.

732
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:41,840
You stick them on a deserted island
with some blue collar guy for like a month.

733
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,513
The guy is like a real loser.

734
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,181
Someone like you?

735
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,050
Whatever man.
You're missing the point here.

736
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,018
Alright, fine,
so what happens then?

737
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:52,755
You film it.You capture the reality of it.

738
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:56,259
It's like, beauties
and the beast, only it's real.

739
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,694
It's all about survival.

740
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:01,197
No matter how low this guy
is on the socioeconomic ladder,

741
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,033
one of these girls is going to go for him.

742
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,536
Because she needs
him because she's afraid.

743
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,770
[Tom]
So what does she do?

744
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:12,275
She reaches out across
the great divide to survive.

745
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,376
Even if he's a loser.

746
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,079
Just admit it, you're talking about you.

747
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,914
Man, I've done real news!

748
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:20,450
I've been in the trenches!
I've paid the price!

749
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,885
I've seen stuff
that you couldn't handle.

750
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:27,623
I'm telling you,
reality TV is the new news.

751
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:32,624
It's true. You see everything from the faults
of man to the beauty of God': creation.

752
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:38,897
And that's what's happening with you and
ten supermodels on a deserted island?

753
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,070
Yeah!

754
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,073
You need help!

755
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,412
J' soft piano music J'

756
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,420
[Martin] Twenty years ago, did you ever
think that we'd be here today?

757
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,823
Yesterday, I didn't
think we'd be here today.

758
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:02,269
[Martin]
Hmm.

759
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:10,266
Even in high school,
I knew I wanted to marry you.

760
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,636
You're so beautiful.

761
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:16,641
Loads of common sense.
A good heart.

762
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:23,442
You, could count really well.

763
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:28,518
Wait a minute...
You married up. No fair.

764
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:33,519
Seriously, did you
ever regret marrying me?

765
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:38,694
Because I would hate to think we've
gone this far and you had any regrets.

766
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:42,698
No, I'm not sorry I married you.

767
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:49,810
I don't have any regrets..
or feeling in my toes.

768
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:08,996
[military march-like music]

769
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,926
[Sam]
Roll call little brother!

770
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:46,931
[Jackie and Jessie scream]

771
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:50,533
Sam;

772
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,268
That's right.

773
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:57,269
It's your Uncle Sam... and I want you,
and you, and you, and you.

774
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:01,043
Sam! Get out of my house, now!

775
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,746
No problem,Jackie.
We already got what we came for.

776
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:06,115
I can see your zits
through your mask Gordon.

777
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:07,950
My name is Night Crawler!

778
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:11,420
Oh, how appropriate, a worm.

779
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:15,725
Locking yourself inside, nice Marty,
but that': only half of it...

780
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:19,262
When the real battle starts, the marauders
will come, and they'll take your food,

781
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:21,430
and they'll take your women
and children and start a new world...

782
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,766
You touch me or my
children and I'll call the cops!

783
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,635
You can start your new world in prison!

784
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,069
Alright Jackie,Jackie,
come on. It's just a game.

785
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,938
He's just trying to make
it a little more realistic for us...

786
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:31,073
Because that's the
way it's gonna happen!

787
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,909
Why are you such
a twerp around him?

788
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,577
Would you stand up
for yourself? Defend your family!

789
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,279
That's a girl! Bring it, Jackie!

790
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,314
You're right Marty.
Right now it's just a game.

791
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:40,283
But when that day comes, there won't be any

792
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:43,452
police or any phones to call them on, Jackie.

793
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,154
Because there are no saviors.

794
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:48,159
Jesus! Jesus is the savior!

795
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:49,926
[Gordon]
She's kinda right dad...

796
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,304
[Sam]
Well...

797
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:53,930
Martin! Do something!

798
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,798
Oh, okay, alright.

799
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:58,467
Listen, Sam, the fun': over.
Now go on home.

800
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:00,603
Get home. Scram. Skedaddle.

801
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,272
Seriously, Dad?
Did you grow up in like 1925?

802
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,174
Oh, we're leaving Marty.

803
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:09,779
But just remember, night after night
they'll come in waves...

804
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,448
Night after night.

805
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,817
Oh, I almost forgot.

806
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:16,452
[Jackie]
Sam... Sam!

807
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,024
[paintball gun fires, family screams
and Martin yelps] [Jackie] Martin!

808
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,994
[Sam laughs]

809
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:27,330
[Sam] Come on man.You've got
this beautiful family, and the best

810
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:30,801
you can do to protect
them is a "hide-a-key" fake rock?

811
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,208
[Sam] Maybe you're
not as smart as you look.

812
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:40,710
[Sam]
Gordon!

813
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:43,312
Uh-oh worm,
looks like daddy's angry.

814
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,681
Run along like a good little soldier.

815
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:46,816
[Sam]
Gordon!

816
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,661
[Gordon]
Stop! I'm coming.

817
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:59,729
[Jessie] Is it true?
Uncle Sam took all our food?

818
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:00,896
No, not all of it.

819
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:02,832
Don't you guys see what he's doing?

820
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,002
Seven to ten with
time off for good behavior?

821
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,538
No. In his own weird way,
he's actually trying to protect us.

822
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:13,209
Hmm.Well now, I'm going to try
in my own weird way to protect us.

823
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,679
Power': going back on.
We are returning to earth.

824
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,681
You mean that same earth
with all the weird weather,

825
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:23,085
random acts of violence, and bomb crazy
dictators, making every day a guessing game?

826
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:25,354
Jackie, I'm tired of living in the dark.

827
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,089
All the more reason to turn on the lights.

828
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,425
Just, well then do it for the children.

829
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:33,429
You really think beating Sam at this
ridiculous game of tug of war you've

830
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:38,234
been playing for thirty years is somehow
going to make life better for your kids?

831
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:41,604
<i>Maybe in some weird, Nightmare
Before Christmas, ET, Cast Away,</i>

832
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,272
Home Alone kind of way.

833
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,707
Yeah, I do.

834
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,543
He's taken everything.
It's freezing in here.

835
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:52,544
We have nothing to eat,
and your children are afraid.

836
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,384
Come on guys! Let's be like pioneers.

837
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,786
Let's have an adventure!

838
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:59,755
I mean, how many guys do you know
that get to have a Christmas like this?

839
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,599
The pilgrims.

840
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,393
[Martin]What do you
mean we got nothing to eat?

841
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:07,063
[Martin] We've got food...
there': plenty of food!

842
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,265
See? Food.

843
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:10,733
Let there be food!

844
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,435
Not the table!

845
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:15,404
[Lu] Jessie': fake clay hamburgers
are looking pretty good right about now.

846
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,409
You want heat? Let there be heat!

847
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,577
Burn this!

848
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,645
Okay.

849
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:25,081
I'm giving you the
shirt off my back, Jackie.

850
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,818
When I'm afraid, I will trust in you.

851
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:33,489
[Jessie] In God, whose word
I praise, I will not be afraid.

852
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,936
[Jessie]
What can mortal man do to me?

853
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:39,428
Thank you.

854
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:42,433
[Lu] You learned all this from
that church dude on TV?

855
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:48,304
Two more days, Martin. Make them count.

856
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,439
[Lu and Adam sigh]

857
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,175
I'd rather build a canoe.

858
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:55,315
I'd build an ark.

859
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:20,202
[Martin] Whoa, careful you don't
start a new fashion trend there.

860
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:25,203
Oh yeah, shabby, shabby.
Hey um, what is A-Dog Productions?

861
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,711
That's Adam': label.

862
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:29,812
[Jackie]
Hm?

863
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:30,980
Label?

864
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,816
Yeah, he downloads music, movies,
whatever... makes copies of them

865
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:37,052
and then sells them to his friends at school.

866
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:39,822
Wait, isn't that illegal?

867
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:44,527
Oh, come on guys. Seriously? How do you
think he affords all that stuff in his room?

868
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,729
I thought I bought it for him.

869
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,999
[Lu]Yeah, well,
think again Sherlock.

870
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,334
Mom, seriously, I need
to let Regis know I'm okay.

871
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,503
I don't want him to worry.
How can I do that?

872
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,704
Who's, umm, huh, who?

873
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:58,340
Regis! What is it the name?
You can't remember the name?

874
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,544
I mean there are only two
in the world and mine isn't 100.

875
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:05,014
I don't really care about the name.
All I can see is hair and tattoos.

876
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,716
What is it with you?
And what is up with this hair thing?

877
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:09,585
Regis practically shaves his head.

878
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:14,586
Oh great, bald and then covered
in tattoos. He's practically a convict.

879
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:17,560
Next you're going to tell me he's
shoving an earring in his nose.

880
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:20,029
That would be a nose ring, Martin.

881
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,230
Nose ring.

882
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,032
Oh,that's it!

883
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,867
That's the last step before
they're gone for good.

884
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,735
They start calling
you by your first name

885
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:31,736
Dad, he doesn't have a nose ring, and
his hair is short because he plays football.

886
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:38,220
And he only has one little tattoo...
that matches mine.

887
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:46,585
You have a tattoo?
My baby has a tattoo?

888
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,892
Ah! Is it hot in here?

889
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:54,230
[Jackie] Martin, foot off the pedal, okay?
She's just pushing your buttons.

890
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,066
Tattoos, no tattoos, boyfriends,
why don't we know any of this stuff?

891
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,567
You're her mother,
why don't you know this?

892
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,969
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

893
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:03,405
Once again you are under the impression
that handling all this stuff is all up to me.

894
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,408
You are her father.

895
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,244
I'm boiling hot.

896
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,245
I'm going to go talk to her.

897
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,914
Just, Sweetie.
Take a breath, okay?

898
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,416
This is not an audit,
she isn't the IRS.

899
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:17,990
Calm down.You can't go
in there like a locomotive.

900
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,959
Okay, I got this under control I think.

901
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,962
I'm gonna be fine.

902
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,806
You're seventeen!

903
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,934
[Martin]There is a
time for everything. Okay?

904
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,302
You're going to graduate
high school this year.

905
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:36,005
Next year, you go to college.
Fifty years from now you'll--

906
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:38,774
Dad! Stop!

907
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,844
[Martin]You know what,
I want to see the tattoos.

908
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:44,146
I want to see those tattoos.
Show them to me right now.

909
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:45,481
Has Reggie seen them?

910
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:49,785
Regis! And seriously,
you know nothing about me!

911
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:54,456
You know nothing about anything
except for crunching stupid numbers.

912
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,459
You know, sometimes
life isn't in the math dad.

913
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,662
Look at me. Me!

914
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:01,997
Do you actually think
I would mess up this velvety,

915
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:05,367
pristine skin that
I moisturize three times daily?

916
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:08,372
Do you actually think
I would mess that up with ink?

917
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,381
So you don't have a tattoo?

918
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,315
If you have to ask,
then I can't help you.

919
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:24,482
Okay. I, I'm, I've been
somewhat derelict in my duties.

920
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:29,663
Nice word. Means nothing.

921
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,164
How about we change it?

922
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,666
How about... we start talking now?

923
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:42,338
I mean <i>I...</i> we can talk about the
boyfriends, and tattoos and everything.

924
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:45,013
The good, the bad, the ugly.

925
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:50,579
For what, three days?

926
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,847
What's that supposed to accomplish?

927
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:55,261
In four days, everything
goes back to the way it was?

928
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,858
You've had seventeen years.

929
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,199
Please leave.

930
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:15,582
Alright, I'll play along with your stupid
game, but right now I don't feel like talking.

931
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,895
I'm lost.

932
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:42,297
Yeah, when you start eating
your old fruitcake, I agree.

933
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:47,298
Lu... it's not her, it's me.

934
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,939
I've lost her.
I was not there for her.

935
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,242
Oh, Honey,
don't be so hard on yourself.

936
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:57,079
[Jackie] She's your baby girl.
She's growing up.You're worried.

937
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,315
Another glorious, normal phase.

938
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:02,151
Exactly.

939
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,253
Is she gonna be ready?

940
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:08,327
I mean, have we really prepared
her for the world? This world?

941
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,269
That world.

942
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:16,165
[Jackie]
Honey, she'll be fine.

943
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,833
And, speaking of lost, I can't find Adam.

944
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:19,268
I've looked everywhere.

945
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,680
What?

946
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,607
I think he left the house.

947
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:31,649
Naw, no, no, no, no. He's got
to be around here somewhere.

948
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:40,952
He's a good kid. He probably knows
we're onto him about all this DVD stuff.

949
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,025
He knows we're going to have
to deal with it sooner or later.

950
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:48,026
[Jessie] Daddy. I'm not allowed to tell,
but I thinkTina knows where Adam is.

951
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:50,833
Where is he?

952
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:55,834
Adam will get mad if I tell,
so maybe Tina can tell you instead.

953
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,209
Jessie,Tina is a doll.

954
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,545
She's eight inches of cotton,
plastic and a bad wig.

955
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:07,216
That's going to cost me around $10,000 in
birthday parties for the next twenty years.

956
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:09,184
Maybe we could just
talk to each other directly

957
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:12,020
Don't you think that'd be nice?

958
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:13,989
Be cheaper.

959
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,158
Tell me where your brother is.

960
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,570
[Jessie angrily]
Mm!

961
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,374
Smooth.

962
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:33,509
Jessie? Sweetie?

963
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,344
I'm really sorry that I said that to you.

964
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,579
I apologize. That was mean.

965
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:41,049
[Jessie]
Are you going to apologize to Tina?

966
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,052
I'm sorry Tina.

967
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:52,099
I really am sorry Tina.
I do mean that.

968
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:58,204
Okay!Tina forgives you.

969
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,740
But, she has an important question.

970
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:06,220
<i>Oh.</i>

971
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,581
She can still
keep having birthday parties.

972
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:17,582
It's not that. Tina wants to
know if you believe in God.

973
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:22,224
Jess, I know how important
this is to you and Tina.

974
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:25,394
And anything important to
you is also important to me,

975
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,763
but Mom needs us to find Adam.

976
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:32,467
And if Tina can help us find Adam,
we'll talk about that later. Okay?

977
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:33,402
Promise?

978
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:34,780
Promise.

979
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,574
Follow me.

980
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,757
You were right.

981
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,126
Ran out of juice.

982
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:00,429
Want to tell me what
you're doing up here?

983
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,966
I don't know. Want a bite?

984
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,268
Jessie, go down and
tell mom we found Adam.

985
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,970
We'll be right down, okay?

986
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:10,439
Okay. Sorry.

987
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,010
It's okay.

988
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:18,451
[Martin]
So...

989
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:22,985
So what is this place?

990
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:26,355
I don't know. Just a place.

991
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:29,491
Want to tell me
about all the DVD stuff?

992
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:33,362
I don't know. Sure. I guess.

993
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:34,630
Well first, I just want to make sure.

994
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:39,631
You downloaded music and movies
off the internet and sold it to your friends?

995
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:45,507
<i>I... I guess.</i>

996
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:49,144
You know that': wrong and illegal.

997
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,479
Kind of a big deal, Adam.

998
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,480
Everyone does it though.

999
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,483
It's not like I'm ripping off
a store or hurting anyone.

1000
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,184
You don't think so?

1001
01:00:56,185 --> 01:01:00,355
Are you going to write a personal check to the
people who make the music and the movies?

1002
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:01,657
No.

1003
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,358
Well, how are they going to get paid?

1004
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,028
I mean they did all the work
and now you're making the money.

1005
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:07,829
Do you think that's right?

1006
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,698
I guess not.

1007
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:11,542
Yeah, yeah.

1008
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:16,872
You know your Uncle Sam
and my dad are an awful lot alike.

1009
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:21,873
They like hunting and fishing and bringing
home a lot of dead smelly things.

1010
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,346
I hated it. I wasn't that into it.

1011
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:28,183
But, I wanted so badly
to share what they had.

1012
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,552
I wanted the attention that Sam had.

1013
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:32,888
So did you start killing stuff?

1014
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,356
I tried.

1015
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,857
Always kind of made me puke a little.

1016
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:40,858
But what I did do, is I did things
I knew would make my dad mad.

1017
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:46,698
I grew my hair long, I listened to music
I knew he detested, and I even stole stuff.

1018
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:52,040
You stole stuff? Like what?

1019
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,408
Jeans.

1020
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:54,743
You stole jeans?

1021
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:57,212
Oh, not just any jeans.

1022
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,215
Acid washed jeans.

1023
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,386
It made him really angry.

1024
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,389
So wait. Why are you mad
at me if you did it too?

1025
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,558
You were like worse.
You stole from a store.

1026
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:13,595
First of all, stealing is stealing,
no matter how you cut it. It's wrong.

1027
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:16,932
And second of all,
I'm not mad at you.

1028
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:21,436
It's my job as your dad to help
you understand right from wrong.

1029
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:26,437
Thinking back to stealing those jeans,
it was just a dumb kid thing to do.

1030
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:28,643
The bigger part of it was
that I was really just trying

1031
01:02:28,644 --> 01:02:32,114
to flag down my old
man and say, "I'm here too."

1032
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:37,919
So how do I fix it?

1033
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,257
I don't know. Got any ideas?

1034
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,828
Not really.

1035
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,963
Why don't you just sit here,
and you think about it.

1036
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:50,103
We'll figure it out together.

1037
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:53,177
I'm sorry.

1038
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:57,014
Me too.

1039
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:08,017
J' uplifting Christmas music J'

1040
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:17,826
[Tom] Okay, take the dumbest, weirdest looking
redneck you can find in the country, right?

1041
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:21,630
You give him a tan, you bleach his teeth,
you cut off his mullet if he has one.

1042
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,465
You put him in some designer clothes.

1043
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:26,668
You send him on
a date with a supermodel.

1044
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:30,806
Redneck Redo. Now that':
a show America will watch.

1045
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,808
Is there any idea floating around in that

1046
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:37,512
extremely goofy brain of yours that
doesn't completely degrade women?

1047
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:38,713
What are you talking about?

1048
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:41,354
I love women. All women.

1049
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,823
What are you two screwball:
still doing out here?

1050
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,524
Nothing. Just hanging.

1051
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:53,228
You get too cold out here,
feel free to drop in for

1052
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:56,665
a cup of something
hot to warm you up.

1053
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,043
That's nice.

1054
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,577
What was that? I'm not that old.

1055
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:10,512
[George laughs]

1056
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,186
You're old.

1057
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:26,396
[Martin] Night after night,
the marauders will come.

1058
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,535
Now bring it on, big brother.

1059
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:34,913
[Jackie]
Martin hurry!

1060
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:37,739
[Martin]
What?

1061
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:38,406
--[Jackie] Hey, shhh, shhh, shhh!

1062
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:39,875
--[Martin]What?
--[Jackie] Hey, shhh, shhh, shhh!

1063
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,719
[Jessie]
Puppies!

1064
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,882
[dog whines]

1065
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:48,750
[Jackie]
Martin, put down the flashlight!

1066
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:52,454
Sorry. Here we go.

1067
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:56,892
One, two,three
breathe in. Breathe out.

1068
01:04:56,893 --> 01:05:00,729
[Martin starts pregnancy breathing exercises]

1069
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,265
[Jackie and Lu snicker]

1070
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:04,266
Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie...

1071
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,568
Honey, I'm pretty sure
it's not the same thing.

1072
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,403
<i>Oh.</i>

1073
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,906
Truthfully, this is a little disgusting.

1074
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,408
I don't think I'm ever
going to get pregnant.

1075
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,577
Actually I'm okay with that.

1076
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:19,281
It's not disgusting. It's beautiful!

1077
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:22,484
All things are created by
Him and for Him.

1078
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:27,127
He is before all things. And
in Him, all things hold together.

1079
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:49,446
[High winds and debris rolling down the road]

1080
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,616
[debris hits news truck]

1081
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,031
[Jessie screams]

1082
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:10,532
[Jackie]
What?

1083
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:13,309
[Jackie] Jessie... What?

1084
01:06:15,538 --> 01:06:18,139
<i>Ahh...</i>

1085
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,976
[Martin] "Thanks for the puppies.
They'll make great watchdogs."

1086
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,354
[Jackie]
Sam!

1087
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:26,489
They took Tina too! She's gone

1088
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:33,195
[Jackie]
That's it Martin. He stole our dog.

1089
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,564
J' military drums J'

1090
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,176
[Martin]
You... get in here!

1091
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:49,341
[Martin]
Come on!

1092
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:02,183
Hello North Dakota.

1093
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:05,020
A couple days ago, I told
Don Brendle that I would tear

1094
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:08,556
apart my own house to
find a tax deduction.

1095
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:10,692
[Martin]
Then I got to thinking.

1096
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:14,396
Over 50% of my tax payments go to
some part of the Department of Defense,

1097
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:16,698
which is around $630 billion.

1098
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,900
2% of which goes to civil defense,

1099
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:23,438
which is constructing shelters
and early warning systems.

1100
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:27,208
So then, I thought...
Why can't this test be

1101
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:31,046
part of that budget and
have it be deductible?

1102
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,281
So based on my salary,
that deduction would

1103
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:36,263
end up being right around $9,232.16.

1104
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,589
If Sam wants a war, we'll give him a war,

1105
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:44,125
but we'll have the other Uncle Sam pay for it.

1106
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:45,760
[Martin laughs]
This is brilliant!

1107
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:49,464
[Martin]
Oh, and this test will be televised.

1108
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:51,566
The IRS is going
to want proof of the test.

1109
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,478
It's a hole.

1110
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:58,273
[Jessie] Daddy': making
booby traps like Home Alone.

1111
01:07:58,274 --> 01:08:01,776
[Adam] Night after night,
the marauders will return.

1112
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:03,945
Three days and three nights.

1113
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:07,415
Uncle Sam is coming back, but we're
going to get to him before he gets to us.

1114
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:08,950
<i>[I-ll]
Excuse me, umm...</i>

1115
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:11,953
Yeah, that didn't exactly work last
night with your pots and pans.

1116
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:13,421
Ah, that': okay. We're not
going to be doing alarms.

1117
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:14,456
It's going to be booby traps.

1118
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:17,258
I'm talking big booby traps! Like
extreme home makeover booby traps!

1119
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,094
Am I the only one seeing this here?

1120
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:22,263
I mean, you're talking about
completely destroying our house.

1121
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,966
That <i>is...</i> preposterous.

1122
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:26,301
[George]
Hey... Check it out.

1123
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:28,803
Says here the power
is out all over the city.

1124
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:30,472
Let me see that.

1125
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:31,952
Ouch!

1126
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:36,183
[Tom]Wind blew out
everything. That's weird.

1127
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,461
A blackout!

1128
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:56,204
He does work in mysterious ways.

1129
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:02,137
I think she may be on to something.

1130
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,639
[Lu] I think maybe the
power just went out.

1131
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,876
[Martin] Well that may be,
but either way, here we are.

1132
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:11,146
We're better off in
here than anyone out there.

1133
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,013
Hold on.

1134
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:14,182
I'm still seeing a new
shower out of this, right?

1135
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:15,817
Oh, gosh, we're halfway there!

1136
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:18,822
[military drums and brass]

1137
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:34,702
[Tom]
You're on!

1138
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:39,674
[George] All Martin Taylor wanted was three
days away from the maddening crowd.

1139
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:43,211
Three days away from the
technological progress and moral

1140
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:47,024
regression that has put a
stranglehold on today's society.

1141
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:53,087
But in the process,
Family Taylor has been invaded

1142
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:57,725
by the very forces they've tried
to insulate themselves from.

1143
01:09:57,726 --> 01:10:04,200
An overzealous armed forces; nosey
neighbors who ridicule and point fingers.

1144
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:10,601
And yes, they've even
been invaded by the media.

1145
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:14,375
[George] They've been pushed to their
limit by one of society's outcasts...

1146
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:18,586
Mr. Taylor's own
unstable survivalist brother Sam.

1147
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:29,290
Power? Who says we don't have power?

1148
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:33,428
[George] With their meager provisions
pillaged, their beloved pets stolen,

1149
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:38,429
and even one of their own, Tina,
the soul of their family, taken hostage,

1150
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:44,068
the Taylor family has endured and united
in a heroic effort to fight back the tide.

1151
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:50,612
[George] And yes, for better
or worse, come together under

1152
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:53,617
one roof with a common purpose.

1153
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,503
[George]
Can the family Taylor do it...?

1154
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:18,506
Can they keep afloat against
an undertow so strong it has

1155
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:23,479
sucked into the darkness the very society
it was meant to protect and inspire?

1156
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:32,453
[Goerge] Alas, they are a metaphor
for the little people-- You and I.

1157
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:37,454
The faint but enduring chorus crying
out for liberty and justice for all.

1158
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:39,961
[George]
Their voyage is our voyage...

1159
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,630
Their success is our success...

1160
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:45,333
Their failure is our failure

1161
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:48,474
God speed Taylor family.
God speed!

1162
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:56,878
Five minutes until curtain.

1163
01:11:56,879 --> 01:11:59,013
Places please!

1164
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:00,481
So, how'd I do?

1165
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:03,053
Your parents would be proud.

1166
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:06,187
[Martin]
Just give us a second.

1167
01:12:06,188 --> 01:12:06,988
Thanks.

1168
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:10,992
Alright guys, I know this has
been a pretty rotten Christmas,

1169
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:14,529
and I just wanted to let
you know that after taking

1170
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:17,365
a good long hard look in the mirror,

1171
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:22,366
checking in with you, I realize
the missing link in all this has been me.

1172
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:29,173
And for that I am sorry.
Now... let's go get them!

1173
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:33,523
Yeah! Let's get them.

Ow! I scratched my back!

1176
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:02,243
[Sam] Seriously Marty,
you can do better than that.

1177
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:04,087
[Gordon]
So stupid.

1178
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:14,722
[Sam chuckles quietly]

1179

[Gordon]
Wigs?

1180
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:20,628
[Sam]
Game on Gordy!

1181
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:21,562
[Gordon]
It's Night Crawler...

1182
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,406
Night Crawler!

[Jessie]
They're here.

1185
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:30,304
You're up!

1186
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:32,073
[Jessie]
I'm on it.

1187
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:32,940
[Sam]
Downstairs.

1188
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:34,784
[Gordon]
Roger that.

1189
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:41,155
[Sam]
Hmm... nice.

1190
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:48,589
[Jessie]
Hi Uncle Sam!

1191
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:50,592
So nice to see you.

1192
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:58,101
[Sam] Alright Jess... you got me.

1193
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:01,602
[sound of lighter flicked on]

1194
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,446
[Jessie]
Here, catch!

1195
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,951
[explosion sound]

1196
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,948
[Sam laughs]

1197
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:17,954
I'm not buying it.
Are you buying it Tina?

1198
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:22,290
Tina is not buying it either, Jess.

1199
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,324
[Jessie] Hmm.

1200
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:25,327
[sound of machine gunfire]

1201
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,800
I'm buying that. Strike!

1202
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,803
[sound of bowling pins getting knocked over]

1203
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:39,340
[Sam]
You're going down little brother!

1204
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:41,343
Yeah, look who's talking!

1205
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:44,545
[Sam]
You too old man!

1206
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:45,980
[Tom]
I'm not that old!

1207
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:48,349
[George laughing]
You're old.

1208
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:49,317
[Martin]
Tina!

1209
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,219
[Jessie]
No! Leave her!

1210
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:52,487
[Martin]
Alright, come on.

1211
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,492
[Sam]
Ho Ho H-- Oh... that hurt.

1212
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:15,676
Come on! Get in here.

1213
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:16,511
Nice job!

1214
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,513
--Thanks.
--Boom!

1215
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,516
Well, we got another player.

1216
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:25,720
He swallowed the bait.

1217
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:27,359
[Adam]
Hit it.

1218
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,690
[light clicks on]

1219
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,068
[Gordon]
Huh?

1220
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:37,101
[squish]

1221
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:46,240
[crunch and Gordon begins to grimace]

1222
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:48,876
[Jessie laughs]

1223
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:51,881
[Gordon begins to cry out]
[Jessie continues to laugh]

1224
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:56,618
[Adam]
You can't eat clay dumbo.

1225
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,652
[smack]

1226
01:16:23,779 --> 01:16:26,783
Come on Sam! Huh!
You can do better than that.

1227
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:33,087
[Gordon over radio]
Dad... Night Crawler': down!

1228
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:34,922
[Gordon]
I'm stuck!

1229
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:37,927
[Gordon struggles]

1230
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:42,263
What are you doing?

1231
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:43,931
I'm stuck!

1232
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:47,602
I'm standing right here, you can
put that thing down you dummy!

1233
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,947
We're in the middle of a battle.

1234
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:55,811
Get un-stuck!
They're dug in upstairs.

1235
01:17:01,316 --> 01:17:02,950
[Sam]
Hurry! Come on!

1236
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:04,953
[Gordon]
Now my feet are cold.

1237
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:09,624
I need Night Crawler,
not Whiney the Pooh!

1238
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:12,299
Let's move it! Come on!

1239
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:14,462
[Sam]
Hurry!

1240
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:17,535
[Gordon] Okay...
I'm coming.Wait for me.

1241
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:26,470
[Sam]
Good start bro! I like your spirit!

1242
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:28,976
Oh, what's this?

1243
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:33,977
Yeah, okay. I think I'll
start with door number...

1244
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:37,896
<i>...two.</i>

1245
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:43,168
[Sam]
Huh.

1246
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,496
I'm going to go on a little recon.

1247
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,831
You check out the
rest of the rooms down here.

1248
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:51,365
[Gordon]
Really?

1249
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:53,534
Yes, really!

1250
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,835
Where': your weapon?

1251
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:55,836
[Gordon]
I don't know.

1252
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:58,909
Gordon! You're on your own now son!

1253
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:09,052
[Lu "crying"]

1254
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:13,021
[I-ll]
Come in Gordy.

1255
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:19,227
[Lu continues to "cry"]

1256
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,074
[I-ll]
Help me.

1257
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:28,869
[I-ll]
Gordy, I'm so scared...!

1258
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:31,038
I don't like this any more!

1259
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:31,539
[Gordon]
What ha--

1260
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:34,578
[I-ll]
Will you take me out of here?

1261
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:44,595
<i>[Gordon]
Whoa... whoa... whoa...!</i>

1262
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:48,789
[Gordon]
Ow;

1263
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:53,427
[Gordon struggles]

1264
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:56,397
No! Stop... please... don't!

1265
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:58,400
[Gordon]
Oh no!

1266
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:03,280
[Gordon]
Lug

1267
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:07,109
Now that': art!

1268
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:13,320
He's all yours.

1269
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:17,151
[Gordon] I want to be on
your team Uncle Marty!

1270
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:19,428
Maybe next time Gordy.

1271
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:21,793
[Gordon sighs]

1272
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:45,613
--[Sam] Fee, fie, foe, fum. I smell
the blood of my nephew... Adam.

1273
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:46,614
--[Jessie] I'm scared... --[Sam] Fee, fie, foe, fum.
I smell the blood of my nephew... Adam.

1274
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:51,615
--[Sam] Fee, fie, foe, fum. I smell
the blood of my nephew... Adam.

1275
01:19:56,158 --> 01:20:00,163
[Sam laughs]

1276
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:12,139
Got ya;

1277
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,875
[Jessie screams]

1278
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:16,844
[Martin]
Hey big brother!

1279
01:20:16,845 --> 01:20:18,345
[Martin]
Go long!

1280
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:19,825
[Sam]
Ooh.

1281
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,684
[Martin]
You remember that Sam?

1282
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:27,531
It's between you and
me now. Mano a Mano.

1283
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:32,160
Go, go, go, go, go!

1284
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,164
Game on!

1285
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:43,046
[Martin]
Go, go, go, go, go!

1286
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:55,358
[Martin] You can't even beat your unprepared,
disorganized, scrawny little baby brother.

1287
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:04,561
[Martin]
Be scary or be scared.

1288
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:17,371
[Martin]The world isn't
going anywhere Sam...!

1289
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:21,876
But this thing between
you and me does end... tonight.

1290
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:26,046
[Sam]The bathroom, huh?
Right back where you started.

1291
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:27,890
[Martin]
Ha ha.

1292
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:39,059
[Sam] You know what Marty?
I'm proud of you.

1293
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:42,563
You finally cracked the nut and
started standing up for yourself.

1294
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:47,240
You're right. It ends tonight.You win.

1295
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:53,073
Don't wimp out on me now.

1296
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:55,315
Just surrendering my weapon.

1297
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:02,418
Game over. I surrender.

1298
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:07,156
Now don't just stand there,
l give already.

1299
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:11,759
I want you to know
what victory smells like.

1300
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:16,130
What it does to your soul.
Take me down.

1301
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:18,509
Come on. Do it.

1302
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:21,769
Do it!!

1303
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:25,272
Okay, get down.

1304
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:26,946
Arms up!

1305
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:31,979
Lower!

1306
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,180
[Sam laughs]

1307
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:34,949
Hands where I can see them.

1308
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,952
Yes sir, officer!

1309
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:50,965
Going down.

1310
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,809
[Martin yells]

1311
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:56,971
[Lu]
Dad?

1312
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:57,972
[Sam laughs]

1313
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,306
You think I'm blind.

1314
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:01,308
Survival means knowing your surroundings,

1315
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:04,144
and playing them before they can play you.

1316
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:07,388
Oh yeah?
Then how'd you miss this?

1317
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,195
[Sam yells]

1318
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,240
[Jackie]
Martin!

1319
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:27,877
Oh, karate.Those were
the classes you were taking.

1320
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,551
Uh, dad?

1321
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:38,880
[Sam and Martin struggling]

1322
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:48,557
[Sam] Ouch, my knee,
my knee, my knee! Ow!

1323
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:55,363
[Sam] Ow! That's my knee again!

1324
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,778
[Adam]
Got ya.

1325
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:12,282
Uh-uh-uh!

1326
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:17,217
[Jessie]
Uh-uh!

1327
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:19,220
[I-ll]
Not going that way.

1328
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:27,295
[Jessie screams]

1329
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:29,797
[thud]

1330
01:24:29,798 --> 01:24:30,564
[George]
Ooo!

1331
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:33,434
[Tom]
Wow... that hurt.

1332
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:34,802
[Sam]
Too old for this.

1333
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:36,248
Here.

1334
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:44,411
That'll teach you to mess with Tina.

1335
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:46,949
Oh, and another thing...

1336
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:50,250
You can huff and you can puff,

1337
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:53,087
...but you're never blowing
this house down again!

1338
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,658
Game over.

1339
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:00,994
You're not going to shoot me?

1340
01:25:00,995 --> 01:25:02,429
Ah, that': you and Dad.

1341
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:05,934
I'm with Lu. I don't
call dead animals art.

1342
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:12,181
[Martin]
Thanks for the gift buddy.

1343
01:25:14,476 --> 01:25:16,110
[Martin]
Love you bro.

1344
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:19,179
[Gordon]
Can I get a towel or something?

1345
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:21,182
I think I chipped a tooth.

1346
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:25,829
[Lu] It makes you look
cool Gordy. You'll live.

1347
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,968
[Sam]
Come here son.

1348
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:37,798
Come here.

1349
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,700
A little goofy, but what the hay.

1350
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:40,634
--Why not.

1351
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:43,137
--Did I just say, "What the hay?"
--Why not.

1352
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:44,805
[watch beeps]

1353
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:47,841
Uh-oh. You guys.

1354
01:25:47,842 --> 01:25:50,144
We did it.Three days!

1355
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:53,149
We did the test.We did it!
We made it!

1356
01:25:56,518 --> 01:25:58,652
Come here, come here.
Let 'em do their thing.

1357

1362
01:26:26,581 --> 01:26:28,424
[Martin]
There you go!

01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:31,852
And there was light!

1364
