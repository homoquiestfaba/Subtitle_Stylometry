1
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:45,658
Based on a true story.

2
00:00:45,658 --> 00:00:50,872
4, 1967 JUNE Saville Theatre, London

3
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,768
There is so much
contest this time.

4
00:01:10,768 --> 00:01:14,140
- The Queen, The Who...
- I do not know...

5
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,175
I do not see it as
contest... not.

6
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:20,389
But think yourself better than
all of them?

7
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:27,001
A YEAR BEFORE
Cheetah Club - New York

8
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:12,878
Sorry to bother you.
Is Linda Keith?

9
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:15,665
Is Linda Keith.
Fantastic!

10
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:17,911
I was there with my friends
and saw immediately that it was you.

11
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:21,009
Can I have your autograph, please?
Dedicated it to Ted?

12
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:23,745
Not you rather before a kiss?

13
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:30,572
accounts with your friends that was the closer you got

14
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:36,049
to make a brooch to the Rolling Stones.
That's what you want, right?

15
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:43,203
I'm here with friends,
at this table here.

16
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:46,818
Do you want to join us,
a few drinks?

17
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:51,024
- Are you lemons?
- Honey, I forgot the lemons.

18
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:52,812
- No lemons?
- No lemons.

19
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:54,592
Come on, you know I need
of lemons.

20
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:14,120
Howlin 'Wolf?
Robert Johnson?

21
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,269
T-Bone Walker? It is a promotional copy,
completely fresh.

22
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:23,966
Whatever you want.
I trust you.

23
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:25,066
Roberta.

24
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:31,655
- Dylan?
- Yup...

25
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,297
Hair like him.

26
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:45,303
Jimi?

27
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,600
Want to try something?

28
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:20,267
One thing... the first time
not see in the mirror.

29
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:02,655
These types-ignited, you know?

30
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:06,361
- They were true to what they believed.
- Just as your eyes for me.

31
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:07,591
- No...
- Yes.

32
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:10,731
- Even very good.
- Yup?

33
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:15,329
Of course, because
is your real name.

34
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:19,060
I think Jimi James
sounds very...

35
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,549
- Canto-author...
- It's just for show.

36
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,554
Why do you need it?

37
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:27,558
I go on stage and I have to act.

38
00:06:27,558 --> 00:06:31,151
Yes, because you can not take the stage
and act?

39
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:33,732
- Because you have to be a character?
- It's one thing, you know...

40
00:06:33,732 --> 00:06:37,288
It's not. It's not a thing.
It's nothing.

41
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:45,915
Are you up there with hair arranged
and a leopard pattern shirt.

42
00:06:45,915 --> 00:06:49,377
- It's leopard, is a cheetah.
- Really?

43
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:52,114
Yes... you know, Cheeta Club.
Shirt cheetah...

44
00:06:52,114 --> 00:06:55,567
Really?
Not got there.

45
00:06:57,498 --> 00:07:03,164
Will you continue on that stage with your
cotton shirt, you will be hidden there.

46
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:07,797
Of course, there are many other guys.
I just do not understand...

47
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,120
Why not?

48
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:19,163
I know where this is going.

49
00:07:19,163 --> 00:07:22,239
- Where? What do you mean?
- Nowhere.

50
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:26,948
You're so serious!
We are just enjoying ourselves, you know?

51
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,047
Do you think I'm wrong?

52
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:39,910
- In some things, yes.
- Yup? Yeah.

53
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:55,209
You know, if you're done with
standards of cheetah and leopard...

54
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,769
- Drop the Curtis?
- Yes

55
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,921
Why.? For I would...

56
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:03,224
I find it quite adequate.

57
00:08:03,224 --> 00:08:07,674
But it's the only thing I can say
of him.

58
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:10,917
You're bad, you can not take so personally.
It's just a thing.

59
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:14,352
I know, I have nothing to
lead to chest.

60
00:08:14,352 --> 00:08:22,939
The more it takes to get you to you and R
your cotton shirt in an empty club?

61
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,912
's How it is.

62
00:08:24,912 --> 00:08:27,735
Got Curtis, and me
is just a concert.

63
00:08:27,735 --> 00:08:32,497
Gain enough, we all have things to pay
.

64
00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:36,753
- Yes, but what if camest forth out?
- Are you stoned.

65
00:08:36,753 --> 00:08:38,795
- No!
- Are you stoned.

66
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:44,724
I'm asking you if that camest forth out
tocarias music?

67
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:50,610
I do not know... it's like you ask me if I had
a spaceship was going to Venus or Mars.

68
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:57,842
It's nothing. I'm asking if you could
play your music as you do?

69
00:08:57,842 --> 00:09:01,021
If you could do things my way...

70
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,214
I did it, you know?
It was something new.

71
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:12,576
It was my own thing,
you know? Yes...

72
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,772
But I can not drop the Curtis
now, so...

73
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:27,052
The guitar is it, so...
I'm not even a guitar, you know?

74
00:10:16,724 --> 00:10:18,326
Jimi.

75
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:21,722
Jimi!

76
00:10:22,102 --> 00:10:25,670
- I want to go to The Village you.
- There's nothing there.

77
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,540
- Can I borrow a few bucks?
- What?

78
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,318
I will not play tonight,
so do not consi...

79
00:10:32,318 --> 00:10:34,997
You spent the last dollar that you had that damn
disc!

80
00:10:34,997 --> 00:10:38,050
- Dylan?
- It's my money.

81
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,221
And you caught it, salts
and do what you want?

82
00:10:42,657 --> 00:10:46,783
Not lend you anything.
Did you hear?

83
00:10:46,783 --> 00:10:51,909
- If you want something, waves me with you.
- There's nothing there.

84
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:55,998
Shit...

85
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:06,882
It's good you bring me food.

86
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:12,481
Thank you.

87
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:15,831
Do not ever over
whitey albums.

88
00:11:16,118 --> 00:11:17,783
Jimi?

89
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:57,911
MANAGER / PRODUCER OF ROLLING STONES

90
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,164
- And do not you stayed unimpressed.
- It's nothing.

91
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,604
- Did you see how he plays?
- Is less than that, is rubbish.

92
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,727
- God...
- The hands of it are amazing.

93
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:57,720
- Is an amazing guitarist.
- It's not that they are missing.

94
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,980
And what was he playing?
A improvisation full of nothing.

95
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,760
It lost more money with him
than I do.

96
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,224
He is bright.

97
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:07,478
What will I do?
I am hired by your boyfriend.

98
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:08,623
When he returned from the tour,

99
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:12,334
I inform you that I share my time between
and he your friend?

100
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,839
Linda, I realize more than
what you know.

101
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,686
I'm tired to call me
"the manager of the Rolling Stones"

102
00:13:19,686 --> 00:13:23,724
as thou "a girlfriend of Keith Richards
"

103
00:13:23,724 --> 00:13:25,844
like a
description of employment.

104
00:13:25,844 --> 00:13:30,978
Identity is a fantastic thing.
I encourage you to get a head.

105
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:35,654
But for God's sake, a bit of description
not hurt anyone.

106
00:13:37,553 --> 00:13:41,521
- Anda. Beautiful?
- Have a good night.

107
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,512
- Come on!
- Because people care?

108
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,899
To spend that time
come see you?

109
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:50,077
Did you find it really fun?

110
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:53,588
Think it's attractive
doors to look directly at people?

111
00:13:53,588 --> 00:13:56,554
- They had a strange skin.
- Are you that only you look at your skin.

112
00:13:56,554 --> 00:13:59,238
Are you up there and not say anything
.

113
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:03,996
And when you decide not speak out more
than an inaudible whisper.

114
00:14:03,996 --> 00:14:08,233
- I'm Keith, you know...
- I'm not asking you to be you Keith!

115
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,983
I pray thee, thou mount there and you
apoderes stage

116
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:15,603
as who really aspires
something.

117
00:14:15,603 --> 00:14:18,402
Yeah... okay.

118
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:19,463
Okay.

119
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:22,857
You know that already do not have anyone
to come see you play?

120
00:14:22,857 --> 00:14:25,266
You can look at me when I talk to you
?

121
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:38,759
- I do not have anyone.
- Thank U.

122
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,798
That tells you something?

123
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:43,380
- Yes? I can not believe it.
- I heard you!

124
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,061
Talk low, is
during another show.

125
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:47,964
Okay, thank you!
Yup!

126
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:07,942
You know I've never been
in Harlem?

127
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:14,481
I like to see other places, but
never been in Harlem.

128
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:18,401
- You could invite me.
- I would like.

129
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:22,002
There's nothing there for you.

130
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:29,684
Wander through New York.
It's kind of...

131
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:35,734
Everyone knows everything!

132
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:41,506
Only speak of the two.
It's humbling, very humbling!

133
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:45,330
For you to be, and I pity
it, really I have.

134
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,346
And he's a drug addict.
Know that?

135
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:51,290
's Always that!

136
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,823
Will you let her walk so
for America?

137
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:00,489
Chas.

138
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:05,265
Chas, hello.
I am Linda Keith.

139
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:09,101
- The Keith Richards girlfriend.
- Hello There!

140
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,676
BASS PLAYER OF THE ANIMALS

141
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:13,402
- How are you?
- Well, are you?

142
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:15,260
I'm fine.

143
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,581
I think for me it's over,
after this tour.

144
00:16:19,577 --> 00:16:22,669
We were not anywhere,
lost Alan.

145
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:24,564
Out...

146
00:16:24,564 --> 00:16:29,688
- No, he's afraid of flying.
- Really?

147
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,939
Will play the new album
for us?

148
00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:33,280
- Yes
- E is called?

149
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,255
- House of the rising sun.
- Okay, here are The Animals.

150
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,300
No... over.

151
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,315
I see the written headlines.

152
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:48,861
Our manager robbed us shamefully
.

153
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:53,834
- What does he say?
- Spending money to make money...

154
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:56,214
It is money that never see.

155
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:04,475
I want to be manager of some musicians.
I treat them well and paid the bills.

156
00:17:04,475 --> 00:17:09,305
- And you? You're still model?
- Occasionally... yeah.

157
00:17:09,305 --> 00:17:13,583
To the chagrin of my father, the girls
British should not do that.

158
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:17,050
I'm not sure what it is supposed
do, but apparently

159
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:23,081
be model and walk with the Rolling Stones
are not viable options.

160
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:29,411
Things are coming.
Always come.

161
00:17:30,998 --> 00:17:35,119
Or so I was told.

162
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,209
You talk seriously about leaving for
act to manage?

163
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:52,383
Because I have something for you.

164
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,019
You can try you for
put something else?

165
00:17:56,019 --> 00:18:00,099
You go up there for a reason...

166
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:02,478
I do not know, maybe...

167
00:18:02,478 --> 00:18:08,151
Will you sing? Would have much
offerings cantasses.

168
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:11,481
My voice is...
is terrible!

169
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:15,121
Also Dylan! He
has turned out well, do not you?

170
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:21,981
Chas really likes blues.

171
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:31,711
So if you're in the mood
can touch something...

172
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:36,541
Bluesy? Sure... whatever you want
that touch, I play.

173
00:18:38,323 --> 00:18:41,330
I look like your mother?

174
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,545
I do not know.

175
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:58,492
Your thing, Jimi.
Your way.

176
00:18:58,527 --> 00:19:00,840
He's kind of quiet.

177
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,804
So if you do not speak much
light not the chest,

178
00:19:04,804 --> 00:19:07,747
's not in his nature.
- Of Course.

179
00:19:08,695 --> 00:19:13,356
He thinks not... well it
does not like singing.

180
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:18,245
And think you have a voice
quite weird, but...

181
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,728
not think it's anything weird
.

182
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:25,965
- I need another, you want too?
- Absolutely, yes.

183
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:29,245
Thank you for coming to Wah coffee.

184
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:32,017
We have a very good show for you
.

185
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:38,334
To begin this evening,
Jimi James and the Blue Flames.

186
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:28,342
Damn!

187
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,585
So, no holes in the clubs
RnB in Harlem?

188
00:21:42,585 --> 00:21:44,652
No, my, they're very restrictive
there.

189
00:21:44,652 --> 00:21:49,005
They managed to get the blues there,
do not know who took him home.

190
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:52,847
- They fuck them.
- Fuck! I like him.

191
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:55,298
- You're brilliant.
- Thank U.

192
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:58,768
- Linda told you what to play?
- No... just told to play.

193
00:21:58,768 --> 00:22:03,472
I heard almost everything there is to hear and...


194
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:08,941
Dismantle you all with your
hands, man. Jesus Christ!

195
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:11,044
- Nobody brokered you?
- No...

196
00:22:11,044 --> 00:22:13,938
Jimi, you're not much of commitments
it?

197
00:22:13,938 --> 00:22:14,862
- No.
- For...

198
00:22:14,862 --> 00:22:19,167
- Linda told you I search...
- People who would like to work.

199
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:21,737
What do I broker, but was never
manager in life.

200
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:24,520
- I have never been touted.
- Neither Even Steven.

201
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,660
Okay... go for a tour
within 3 months.

202
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,242
I think it would be great if you came with me to London
.

203
00:22:32,242 --> 00:22:35,723
London... there is already there so many people
good playing.

204
00:22:35,723 --> 00:22:38,693
But you do not got to you.
Of that you can be sure.

205
00:22:38,693 --> 00:22:42,972
No one bothers you because of this chord
, or that...

206
00:22:42,972 --> 00:22:45,835
They would be crazy to see what
you do there.

207
00:22:46,517 --> 00:22:51,318
All that play there're
the stream of blues...

208
00:22:51,318 --> 00:22:53,915
But do not want to be caught
this type of labels, you know?

209
00:22:53,915 --> 00:23:00,258
He is playing blues. Or RnB,
or soul... all are cages, man.

210
00:23:00,258 --> 00:23:02,518
I'm not saying it has to be...

211
00:23:02,518 --> 00:23:04,484
You do not have to do with style, you know?

212
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:08,757
I want my music
enter the person's soul.

213
00:23:08,757 --> 00:23:10,356
For me are colors.

214
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:13,168
I want people to feel the music
the same way that I see it.

215
00:23:13,168 --> 00:23:19,080
They're just colors... the rest is a bit
painted science fiction here and there.

216
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,959
I do not want to scare you...
early.

217
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:26,028
I have to take you to London.

218
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:34,040
Already know you a pimp seriously?
Yes, pimps use it on the streets.

219
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,534
Yes... use.

220
00:23:37,534 --> 00:23:39,433
I will use it on stage.

221
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:42,744
Say, "Look at that pimp with
guitar upside down."

222
00:23:42,744 --> 00:23:45,648
Is a type looking for you.
Says called Keith.

223
00:23:45,648 --> 00:23:48,841
- Richards?
- Allen.

224
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:52,261
Leave it up... I think.
Yup.

225
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:55,755
- Who is Allen?
- Is my father.

226
00:23:55,755 --> 00:23:58,533
- You're kidding, right?
- No...

227
00:23:59,347 --> 00:24:03,065
- Are you serious?
- Yup!

228
00:24:03,065 --> 00:24:04,616
Shit...

229
00:24:11,327 --> 00:24:13,239
What beautiful work...

230
00:24:14,575 --> 00:24:17,804
You do not want to say anything before?

231
00:24:19,013 --> 00:24:21,385
This is Mr. Jimi Hendrix.

232
00:24:24,216 --> 00:24:26,241
Pleasure.

233
00:24:28,565 --> 00:24:30,407
Tidy your things.

234
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:33,630
Tidy your stuff...

235
00:24:34,631 --> 00:24:36,383
So, my...
Come on!

236
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:18,241
It's all arranged. Can you
leave work and some decent concerts.

237
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:23,028
Initially it will not be much money,
but I take care of the expenses.

238
00:25:24,727 --> 00:25:26,702
I do not know, my...

239
00:25:26,702 --> 00:25:31,312
- You wanted to come to London before.
- Yes, but that was before.

240
00:25:31,312 --> 00:25:34,514
So what changed?

241
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:40,083
You do not have much to say, do you?

242
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:43,659
A speech... the other listens.

243
00:25:49,538 --> 00:25:51,148
You know Eric Clapton?

244
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:54,375
- If heard of him?
- Not if you know him.

245
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:57,964
Course, Clapton is a myth.

246
00:25:57,964 --> 00:26:01,760
If it is to London, you present it to me?

247
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,285
He, Beck, the Townshend...

248
00:26:04,285 --> 00:26:09,011
- No... only the Clapton.
- Okay, so we get.

249
00:26:09,046 --> 00:26:12,082
- You passport?
- No, my...

250
00:26:12,082 --> 00:26:15,227
- You birth certificate?
- Do Not...

251
00:26:15,227 --> 00:26:19,173
Do you know how to have a copy?
Your family has a copy?

252
00:26:19,173 --> 00:26:22,077
I have to call my father.
No... not you'll call.

253
00:26:22,077 --> 00:26:26,811
If not we have the birth certificate
not you got a passport.

254
00:26:27,488 --> 00:26:29,867
I do not know, but I will not call you.

255
00:26:32,866 --> 00:26:39,166
Okay... I do some calls.
Shit families, uh?

256
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:43,872
You know, my father did not recognize me if he saw me
now, you know?

257
00:26:43,872 --> 00:26:46,050
I have not spoken to him Condo
much time, you know?

258
00:26:47,445 --> 00:26:50,372
Nor should know I'm alive
or not.

259
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,518
24, 1966 LONDON SEPTEMBER

260
00:27:46,196 --> 00:27:48,532
CLAPTON IS GOD

261
00:27:48,532 --> 00:27:49,744
How was your trip?

262
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:57,943
No, I'm not ready...
I am a mess.

263
00:27:57,978 --> 00:28:00,538
The next time you're
will be a mess...

264
00:28:06,974 --> 00:28:09,688
- How is he?
- Life is a party.

265
00:28:17,554 --> 00:28:19,634
We are at night, then?

266
00:28:22,459 --> 00:28:25,414
At about 21. In the Scotch?

267
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:29,451
No, I still have work visa
can only play a few minutes.

268
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,171
- Jimi, we go to the hotel.
- What time shall we meet?

269
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:48,929
Arise.
Come on.

270
00:28:49,698 --> 00:28:54,363
You have to see what the Chas brought.
Seems a savage.

271
00:28:54,363 --> 00:28:55,932
Can I have a drink?

272
00:28:55,932 --> 00:28:59,294
- I have spoken with Jimi!
- Stop crying.

273
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:02,309
I will have with you the Scotch!

274
00:29:19,882 --> 00:29:22,884
Hello, how are you?

275
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:27,530
- You like it here?
- Yes, yes... and you, are you okay?

276
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:05,679
It's the kind we saw in the afternoon.

277
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:15,467
- You want a drink?
- Yes, a glass of wine.

278
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,900
Fantastic!

281
00:31:30,762 --> 00:31:32,588
Excuse.

00:31:42,383 --> 00:31:44,674

00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:12,111
Yes Or rather, heard of there..

295
00:32:12,111 --> 00:32:14,203
Do not make me laugh!

296
00:32:14,203 --> 00:32:18,479
- Seattle, Washington. That's where I am.
- Where the president live?

297
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:21,298
No... no, it's another Washington.
Is Washington DC.

298
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:25,225
Do you mind to tell him to
out of my place?

299
00:32:33,022 --> 00:32:34,731
Can ask you to leave
my place?

300
00:32:34,731 --> 00:32:37,246
- She is just...
- I did not ask.

301
00:32:37,777 --> 00:32:39,344
I'm just being social
, love.

302
00:32:39,344 --> 00:32:41,308
Why do not you be social
elsewhere?

303
00:32:41,308 --> 00:32:44,535
Why not forsaken the store,
your cow? You know her?

304
00:32:44,535 --> 00:32:45,645
Yes, it is a friend.

305
00:32:45,645 --> 00:32:48,202
Why do not you tell your friend Condo for
go annoy the fuck?

306
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,448
Anyway, there never was...

307
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:55,025
Anyway, you have a beautiful mouth
.

308
00:32:55,025 --> 00:32:57,658
- I can tell you something?
- Yes, says.

309
00:33:01,891 --> 00:33:04,357
My Salts place ?!

310
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:09,807
<i>From one point of the sea to the
circles of your mind</i>

311
00:34:09,807 --> 00:34:13,039
<i>A new force acts on the planetary transformation
</i>

312
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:14,199
<i>A new radio for
a new world</i>

313
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:19,736
<i>An average of 96.3 Khz wave
takes the force of conscience</i>

314
00:34:19,736 --> 00:34:21,751
<i>on the radio Caroline</i>

315
00:35:31,557 --> 00:35:35,037
Fuck!
Jesus Christ...

316
00:35:35,037 --> 00:35:38,269
What are you...
Linda, no!

317
00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:41,331
What the fuck was that ?!

318
00:35:41,331 --> 00:35:44,377
It was my guitar...

319
00:36:48,295 --> 00:36:51,446
Sorry for last night.

320
00:36:51,446 --> 00:36:57,942
I think I left my emotions
take the best of me.

321
00:36:57,942 --> 00:37:01,048
It's all cool, no problem.

322
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:08,274
You were one day, Jimi!

323
00:37:08,274 --> 00:37:13,012
One day in London, and already did
a jetty of nonsense!

324
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:15,489
I do not planned anything.

325
00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:20,234
I have experience in putting
things in a certain order.

326
00:37:20,234 --> 00:37:23,789
... You take away me from a club
was not planned.

327
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,706
I could not have planned it.

328
00:37:26,706 --> 00:37:29,618
Is how things are.
People are not predictable.

329
00:37:30,552 --> 00:37:36,217
Sometimes are... and everything is cool,

330
00:37:36,217 --> 00:37:41,360
and sometimes prefer to stay
drugged instead of being mothers.

331
00:37:46,972 --> 00:37:50,700
This was a very short trip.

332
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:56,231
From your mother let you, the foderes
all the girl that you see.

333
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:03,732
This is how you intend to proceed?
Will be your crutch?

334
00:38:03,732 --> 00:38:08,365
I have no intentions here.
I've seen what they do to people.

335
00:38:08,365 --> 00:38:11,636
"I plan to do this and that."

336
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:15,067
And bad things do not result,
let them all fucked.

337
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:17,126
No... I'm not with them, you know...

338
00:38:17,126 --> 00:38:20,915
I have my own thing, my own
time, my space and everything is beautiful.

339
00:38:20,915 --> 00:38:24,116
- The rest is just...
- Reality!

340
00:38:24,116 --> 00:38:26,436
We can change the world!

341
00:38:26,436 --> 00:38:32,835
If you could, the only thing that would make was
put a little more color on the streets.

342
00:38:32,835 --> 00:38:35,743
Other than that, we have to accept things as are
.

343
00:38:35,743 --> 00:38:38,383
But what will happen is
get started stumbling around...

344
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:41,552
and you'll realize that this is enough.

345
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:45,041
What will be brilliant enough to
make you win the day.

346
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:50,938
And things as there are accepted but
is what you try to say, Jimi!

347
00:38:50,938 --> 00:38:53,984
You can not let other people decide
your life.

348
00:38:53,984 --> 00:38:58,259
This is your life!
Please footholds it?

349
00:38:58,259 --> 00:39:00,738
- Have disses you.
- I say, yes.

350
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:06,971
And I hear you?
That tell me to be myself?

351
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:10,449
What is the alternative? Can not you see me say
to you follow everyone else.

352
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:15,546
- Why you should listen then?
- Because I love you.

353
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:29,148
When I saw you at the Cheetah Club
were twenty people in a room for a thousand.

354
00:39:29,148 --> 00:39:38,508
And these twenty people talked, drank and
ignorant of what was happening on stage.

355
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:40,632
And I wanted to turn me to them all

356
00:39:40,632 --> 00:39:46,904
and say, "They'll be all crazy?"
Do not you see?

357
00:39:46,904 --> 00:39:49,938
Do not see what he can do ?!

358
00:39:50,728 --> 00:39:54,630
I think none of us means
whatever that is for you.

359
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:59,992
Never heard anything that you said.

360
00:39:59,992 --> 00:40:04,805
I always hear.
Always.

361
00:40:09,253 --> 00:40:11,442
What is it?

362
00:40:13,426 --> 00:40:14,658
What?

363
00:40:14,658 --> 00:40:19,412
The first night we spent together
, I told you

364
00:40:19,412 --> 00:40:22,447
"Whatever you do, do not
see yourself in the mirror."

365
00:40:22,447 --> 00:40:27,541
You were me pedrar instead of me saying
soon as you look in the mirror

366
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:31,681
would pass through me.
Come on, that's not fair.

367
00:40:31,681 --> 00:40:35,926
No experience needs to be reckless.

368
00:40:35,926 --> 00:40:40,877
And become in a bathtub
to pass you,

369
00:40:40,877 --> 00:40:44,672
is no way to find that
speak the truth.

370
00:40:48,377 --> 00:40:51,113
What did you see when you looked in the mirror
?

371
00:40:51,113 --> 00:40:54,276
... My shit maradas.

372
00:40:56,406 --> 00:40:59,475
Seemed to Marilyn Monroe!

373
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:02,199
Yes...

374
00:41:10,744 --> 00:41:13,225
Watch the press, Jimi...

375
00:41:15,926 --> 00:41:19,756
They can be extremely fierce.

376
00:41:21,577 --> 00:41:25,095
It is better to have a deal with them...

377
00:41:25,095 --> 00:41:30,770
The Oldham is extremely smart, you would not harm
doors near it.

378
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:34,799
Chas should have thought of this.

379
00:41:34,799 --> 00:41:39,147
It is very good, Chas.
You're in very good hands.

380
00:41:41,278 --> 00:41:44,060
See if the hear.

381
00:42:42,366 --> 00:42:44,331
Do you want to leave?

382
00:44:13,662 --> 00:44:17,967
It's different, really it is.
Is a good time to explore.

383
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:23,010
The Beatles have just done one tour
, left this space.

384
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:29,964
And you the Kinks, the Small Faces...
Everything became... Rock n 'Roll direct.

385
00:44:29,964 --> 00:44:35,980
More raunchy. I think people
're more receptive to it.

386
00:44:37,273 --> 00:44:40,946
It looks like the world is.
Aged too, right?

387
00:44:44,488 --> 00:44:46,599
Not?

388
00:44:47,321 --> 00:44:49,512
- I like your hair.
- I am a hairdresser.

389
00:44:49,512 --> 00:44:50,387
- Yes?
- Yes.

390
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:51,408
I love it.

391
00:44:51,408 --> 00:44:53,584
I know all about hair,
yours is cool.

392
00:44:53,584 --> 00:44:57,650
Is natural or permanent?
Just be honest, do not lie to me.

393
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,875
It has its own life, look.

394
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:03,887
's Cool, it's like Dylan.
I like him very much.

395
00:45:03,887 --> 00:45:05,034
Really?
Thank U.

396
00:45:05,034 --> 00:45:07,795
The way the announcement was made...


397
00:45:07,795 --> 00:45:11,482
- This seems to you a heron?
- No, honey...

398
00:45:11,482 --> 00:45:15,399
You do not have to be anything, you know?
It's beautiful the way it is.

399
00:45:15,399 --> 00:45:20,676
The way it was written, I thought that was a
audition for Animals.

400
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,155
The Animals?
Because you thought that?

401
00:45:23,155 --> 00:45:27,773
No... I'm an animal, but not
"The Animals".

402
00:45:27,773 --> 00:45:30,805
The pay is good?
I'm dry.

403
00:45:30,805 --> 00:45:33,630
- Dry? What do you mean dry?
- I mean bankrupt.

404
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:38,119
I like this term. No, the concert
not pay much.

405
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:40,827
Nothing to do about it.

406
00:45:40,827 --> 00:45:43,085
We're broke, but we're cool.

407
00:45:43,085 --> 00:45:45,002
Yes, we have the right style.

408
00:45:45,002 --> 00:45:49,493
Do you prefer to walk with us and be
bankrupt... and be cool?

409
00:45:51,578 --> 00:45:54,707
I'd rather be here bankrupt.
What do you think?

410
00:46:22,523 --> 00:46:23,656
<i>I</i>

411
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:25,610
<i>I have an international
call to you and to</i>

412
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,635
<i>Jimi Hendrix to Mr. Al Hendrix</i>

413
00:46:27,635 --> 00:46:30,539
<i>- Is Mr. Hal Hendrix?
- Well, yes...</i>

414
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:33,825
<i>- accepted the costs?
- Where does the call</i>

415
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:36,726
<i>- Father!
Accepted costs</i>

416
00:46:36,726 --> 00:46:39,853
<i>- Yes...

417
00:46:39,853 --> 00:46:41,883
<i>- It's Jimi!
- Who</i>

418
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:44,936
The Jimi! Your son Jimi!
Can you hear me?

419
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:48,266
<i>- Who?
- Is your son, Jimi</i>

420
00:46:48,266 --> 00:46:53,378
See this, guess...
Guess where I am..

421
00:46:54,315 --> 00:46:58,362
I'm in London.
I am in London, my!

422
00:46:59,302 --> 00:47:02,053
<i>- I am? ?
- Where</i>

423
00:47:02,053 --> 00:47:03,398
In London, England!

424
00:47:03,398 --> 00:47:06,218
A type caught me a
club where he walked to touch.

425
00:47:06,218 --> 00:47:08,956
Now is my manager and I
my scene happening.

426
00:47:08,956 --> 00:47:12,235
<i>- That's funny?
- I'm making a record</i>

427
00:47:12,235 --> 00:47:16,792
<i>It's funny to you!?
- No, not try to be funny</i>

428
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:20,007
<i>You think I'm an asshole...</i>

429
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:25,794
Father, you know what.?
Wait, someone wants to talk to you.

430
00:47:25,794 --> 00:47:29,652
Come here. Tell him, talk to him.

431
00:47:30,768 --> 00:47:32,967
Hello mr. Hendrix.
Speaks Cathy.

432
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:36,179
<i>- Who is this?
- A friend of Jimi</i>

433
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:40,345
She was eager to meet him, the
Jimi will not stop talking about themselves.

434
00:47:40,345 --> 00:47:44,076
He's here to do sensasionais things,

435
00:47:44,076 --> 00:47:47,019
now has a manager and is
to start a band.

436
00:47:47,019 --> 00:47:51,858
I heard him play, by the way.
Must be very proud.

437
00:47:54,153 --> 00:47:57,092
<i>- Very proud...
Yes, it is in England</i>

438
00:47:57,092 --> 00:47:58,267
Yes!

439
00:47:58,267 --> 00:48:01,459
<i>If you are in England, why the hell I
call collect at the destination </i>?

440
00:48:01,459 --> 00:48:04,005
<i>I do not accept the call radius
payable on target</i>

441
00:48:04,005 --> 00:48:09,035
<i>If you want to talk to me about England, tell him
to write me a fucking letter </ i. >

442
00:48:10,543 --> 00:48:14,756
<i>This guy must think I'm crazy...
</i>

443
00:48:14,756 --> 00:48:17,232
<i>I</i>

444
00:48:17,232 --> 00:48:19,350
<i>- Jim?
- I</i>

445
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:25,982
<i>- I am!
- Yes...</i>

446
00:48:25,982 --> 00:48:31,555
<i>Where the hell did you get the money?
If you are there, it is because you stole</i>

447
00:48:31,555 --> 00:48:36,471
No, do not steal anything, man.
I'm really doing something here.

448
00:48:36,471 --> 00:48:38,894
<i>Yes...</i>

449
00:48:40,865 --> 00:48:44,310
I have to go.
I have to go, okay?

450
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,667
I'll call you later.

451
00:49:11,443 --> 00:49:13,755
All right, gentlemen.

452
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,961
Let's review the situation.

453
00:49:17,961 --> 00:49:21,553
The Redding is entering
replace bassist, right?

454
00:49:21,553 --> 00:49:23,211
It is a good musician and is
willing to join.

455
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:27,967
Right. And the battery? We have to keep the dishes
to beat, or not?

456
00:49:28,989 --> 00:49:32,678
Yes... We're still looking for
drummers.

457
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:37,242
There arrive... spending time.
Time spent is money spent.

458
00:49:37,242 --> 00:49:40,262
Yes... there are things we need...

459
00:49:40,262 --> 00:49:44,802
Jimi Hendrix and the Experience.
Yes, quite like.

460
00:49:44,802 --> 00:49:49,486
- Your name is Jimi, as J-I-M-I.
- Yes, I like it that way.

461
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,519
It was a pleasure to give you the idea.

462
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:54,555
- No, I thought...
- Your success is payment enough.

463
00:49:54,555 --> 00:49:58,411
We have other things to discuss,
to speak truth.

464
00:49:58,411 --> 00:50:03,854
- We have?
- I made some contracts.

465
00:50:03,854 --> 00:50:06,790
Things signed when
tried to do some...

466
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:10,699
We heard some gods old and Jimi reveals that...

467
00:50:10,699 --> 00:50:13,844
were things I did... to play,
nothing serious, you know?

468
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,009
When you say "some contracts"...

469
00:50:16,009 --> 00:50:20,999
I made a recording with Curtis.
And I had to sign something.

470
00:50:20,999 --> 00:50:24,330
- I was doing work background...
- They're a pair of contracts.

471
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:27,585
Technically it still belongs
these types.

472
00:50:27,585 --> 00:50:30,663
Yes, and I'm with a guy...
I was just doing one session.

473
00:50:30,663 --> 00:50:34,033
It's nothing you need to worry
.

474
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:37,547
Okay, when you say "this kind"...
To whom are you referring to?

475
00:50:38,353 --> 00:50:40,843
Juggy Murray.

476
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:46,177
- Do not tell me...
- Yes

477
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:52,298
Okay... we're here
a beautiful situation..

478
00:50:52,298 --> 00:50:55,655
Looks like I'm going to solve it
America.

479
00:50:55,655 --> 00:50:58,861
- What are you...
- The Jimi Hendrix Experience.

480
00:50:58,861 --> 00:51:00,090
Yes, it's better that way.

481
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,397
The chakras are cleaner,
faster.

482
00:51:02,397 --> 00:51:04,425
Says it in a nutshell.

483
00:51:04,425 --> 00:51:07,956
Cherish it, not Jimi?
The economy of vocabulary?

484
00:51:07,956 --> 00:51:09,108
Yes, of course.

485
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:13,941
When I return, I can also have a record contract
there for you.

486
00:51:13,941 --> 00:51:19,243
So deal with
join "experience".

487
00:51:26,257 --> 00:51:31,919
1 OF OCTOBER 1966
REGENT STREET POLYTECHNIC

488
00:51:48,837 --> 00:51:52,039
Is it?
It?

489
00:51:53,058 --> 00:51:58,315
- Is it up there?
- Oh yes, God Himself.

490
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:01,073
Let's see if he wants to talk a bit
?

491
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,221
Let's go before the concert start
.

492
00:52:31,221 --> 00:52:34,648
Yes... asks if
I make a jam with him.

493
00:52:34,648 --> 00:52:37,148
Yes, I want to play with him.

494
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:20,013
Go get the guitar.

495
00:54:39,965 --> 00:54:44,409
Go there. Jimi! This was a
please your friend here.

496
00:54:44,409 --> 00:54:46,852
- A favor your friend!
- Yes, fine.

497
00:54:49,842 --> 00:54:52,997
- Hello, my. I am your big fan.
- Thank U.

498
00:54:52,997 --> 00:54:55,857
I'm a big fan.

499
00:55:02,734 --> 00:55:06,815
- You can connect there.
- No, no... here is fine.

500
00:55:13,916 --> 00:55:18,681
I was thinking about doing a jam.
Know the Killing Floor?

501
00:55:18,681 --> 00:55:23,865
From Menace Boy?
You know the Menace Boy?

502
00:55:23,865 --> 00:55:25,378
I do not know them very much.

503
00:55:25,378 --> 00:55:27,221
Come on, man. Are the blues, you have to know these songs
.

504
00:55:27,221 --> 00:55:29,129
I teach you.

505
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:34,820
We have a guest who
will touch us.

506
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:38,270
Came directly from America.

507
00:55:40,234 --> 00:55:42,269
What's your name again?

508
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:46,642
- Jimi Hendrix.
- Mr. Jimi Hendrix.

509
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:23,613
Damn...

510
00:56:57,862 --> 00:57:02,620
- Eric...
- He is that good?

511
00:58:11,391 --> 00:58:12,835
Give me that.

512
00:58:43,582 --> 00:58:46,588
Now ladies and gentlemen,
your and my favorite,

513
00:58:46,588 --> 00:58:52,360
King of the continents, Tommy Putin.
A big round of applause.

514
00:59:40,445 --> 00:59:43,456
Cathy... look here.

515
00:59:46,093 --> 00:59:47,738
What do you think?

516
00:59:55,777 --> 00:59:58,855
- Sorry... stopped.
- What?

517
01:00:00,266 --> 01:00:02,916
Was working Condo little
and now left to give.

518
01:00:03,753 --> 01:00:05,977
It's broken.
Neither is complete.

519
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:10,016
- Can arrange it?
- Not worth the money spent.

520
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,553
- It is good to me?
- You're very handy.

521
01:00:24,553 --> 01:00:26,468
- Thank you, I buy it? .
- Yes

522
01:00:26,468 --> 01:00:28,155
How much is this, man?

523
01:00:41,733 --> 01:00:44,768
- He is aggressive, I must say...
- In good or bad way?

524
01:00:44,768 --> 01:00:47,141
See how
was always looking for Jimi?

525
01:00:47,141 --> 01:00:50,492
- This is only... is aggressive.
- What did you think of Hensley?

526
01:00:50,492 --> 01:00:51,939
Is just right.

527
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:54,973
- Also liked him.
- I said that I liked.

528
01:00:54,973 --> 01:00:57,320
Is just right, but plays
always safe.

529
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,688
Thanks for the concert, but still
I am learning on bass.

530
01:01:01,688 --> 01:01:03,904
It would be nice to have someone more experienced.

531
01:01:03,904 --> 01:01:05,907
It would be nice to find someone
to show some respect.

532
01:01:05,907 --> 01:01:07,914
This is now your band, is it?

533
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,035
It's called The Jimi Hendrix Experience,

534
01:01:09,035 --> 01:01:11,423
. "The experience of the two types
who came from America"  not

535
01:01:11,423 --> 01:01:13,522
We all know our place.

536
01:01:13,522 --> 01:01:15,801
I do not wanna make a big fuss of it
.

537
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:19,170
He's not afraid, yes.
I do not condemn the can for it.

538
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:21,738
For me reminds me
more Elvin Jones.

539
01:01:21,738 --> 01:01:23,576
Yes, it is more oriented
for jazz!

540
01:01:23,576 --> 01:01:27,504
Yes, so it will not be that thing "rock"
that everyone tries to do, you know?

541
01:01:27,504 --> 01:01:28,464
Exactly.

542
01:01:28,464 --> 01:01:31,186
Would you then put more experience in
Experience.

543
01:01:31,186 --> 01:01:32,931
He's right.

544
01:01:33,616 --> 01:01:36,167
I can say what you want, you know?

545
01:01:36,167 --> 01:01:39,240
Okay... look.

546
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:43,833
Hensley... and Mitch.

547
01:02:18,723 --> 01:02:21,289
<i>Yes... and the Little Richard...</i>

548
01:02:21,289 --> 01:02:24,720
<i>Why are called the The Breakaways</i>

549
01:02:24,755 --> 01:02:30,462
<i>This is the Jimi experience Hendrix
singing...</i>

550
01:02:30,462 --> 01:02:31,302
<i>You will sing, I will not sing
</i>

551
01:02:31,302 --> 01:02:34,437
You must sing.
Are you here choirs.

552
01:02:34,437 --> 01:02:37,624
<i>No, we should put
The Breakaways to sing the melody</i>

553
01:02:37,624 --> 01:02:39,266
<i>I agree, and we support</i>

554
01:02:39,266 --> 01:02:44,241
<i>But I could not go
the high tones. What tone should they arrive, Jimi?</i>

555
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:56,596
Fifty. As far as I know they're there
500, gives three hours right?

556
01:02:56,596 --> 01:02:59,587
- Two hours, Chas...
- Two? Come on, you're hurting me.

557
01:02:59,587 --> 01:03:01,659
- I'm doing you a favor.
- I understand.

558
01:03:01,659 --> 01:03:04,471
- This is the best equipment there...
- I can see that.

559
01:03:04,471 --> 01:03:08,074
- But give me three hours.
- Not tale, Chas, because I know you.

560
01:03:08,074 --> 01:03:12,038
You know me, so not all.
They're there five hundred pounds.

561
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,352
- He has not even tuned the guitar.
- I'm about!

562
01:03:14,352 --> 01:03:15,890
- But no one else booked...
- Two hours.

563
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:17,895
If you finish in two hours...

564
01:03:22,528 --> 01:03:24,404
Recording.

565
01:03:24,439 --> 01:03:26,713
We can download some lights?

566
01:03:26,713 --> 01:03:30,913
To create a certain environment
, you know?

567
01:03:30,913 --> 01:03:33,753
As my voice sounds
that side?

568
01:03:33,753 --> 01:03:36,967
- We have to record the track, Jimi...
- Okay, okay...

569
01:03:36,967 --> 01:03:38,637
With lights or not.

570
01:03:38,637 --> 01:03:44,695
You have to sing faster than
raids to catch the bus home.

571
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:47,615
Okay, here goes...

572
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,341
<i>- No, do you want to download the lights</i>

573
01:03:49,341 --> 01:03:52,917
Please, yes. I think
help. Thank U.

574
01:04:00,995 --> 01:04:02,476
Recording.

575
01:04:05,981 --> 01:04:08,200
Why are the lights off?

576
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:12,132
Jesus Christ, we are recording!

577
01:04:12,132 --> 01:04:15,004
Who writes the shit
of darkness? I knew there.

578
01:04:15,004 --> 01:04:17,955
Good to know, you're not completely stupid
!

579
01:04:17,955 --> 01:04:19,963
Only you doing ignorant!

580
01:04:19,963 --> 01:04:27,251
Now get out of here for us to do something different
to burn money, you bitch!

581
01:04:37,643 --> 01:04:42,007
Okay? Come on...
This time without laughter.

582
01:05:05,154 --> 01:05:08,393
- Yes, that was good.
- Were awesome, girls.

583
01:05:08,393 --> 01:05:11,520
See you later.
I like what they did, it was great.

584
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:16,863
It was cool...

585
01:05:20,003 --> 01:05:23,357
He talks to me like that, call me
goat and not say a word!

586
01:05:23,357 --> 01:05:25,594
- What are you talking about?
- I am the radius of your girlfriend!

587
01:05:25,594 --> 01:05:28,139
- What did you want me to do?
- You should defend myself!

588
01:05:28,139 --> 01:05:31,181
Fuck you, ruined me
take the woman!

589
01:05:32,074 --> 01:05:33,715
Fuck you!

590
01:05:36,615 --> 01:05:38,112
Would you hit me?

591
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:44,542
It's all right.
Has passed, man.

592
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:52,062
You see? She is crazy.

593
01:06:01,823 --> 01:06:03,727
It's crazy...

594
01:06:04,684 --> 01:06:06,782
What is wrong with you?

595
01:06:13,935 --> 01:06:17,848
People come
energy that acts on stage.

596
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:20,938
It's what they call it?
Energy...

597
01:06:20,938 --> 01:06:24,249
But it seems very tiring.
You're having fun?

598
01:06:24,249 --> 01:06:28,043
Yes, it's work as another
whatever.

599
01:06:28,043 --> 01:06:34,038
I go up on stage every night and
consumes a lot of energy as they call,

600
01:06:34,038 --> 01:06:37,600
but if not we give all...

601
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:42,739
We must put all our individuality
what we do, you know?

602
01:06:42,739 --> 01:06:46,989
<i>has a new album about to leave
</i>

603
01:06:46,989 --> 01:06:50,370
Yes, they'll all buy.

604
01:06:50,370 --> 01:06:54,591
But there is so much competition.
The Queen, The Who...

605
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:58,439
No, I see no way
competition.

606
01:06:58,439 --> 01:07:02,354
But the Beatles have mentioned that
find it amazing.

607
01:07:02,354 --> 01:07:04,470
Want to talk about it?

608
01:07:06,607 --> 01:07:09,502
That's right. Fries...
fries and eggs, right?

609
01:07:09,502 --> 01:07:12,843
And drink as much tea!
What is it with tea, man?

610
01:07:12,843 --> 01:07:16,585
We drink tea because it was what
drank while invadiamos India.

611
01:07:16,585 --> 01:07:19,234
That's why we're always agreed
, they'll never sleep!

612
01:07:19,234 --> 01:07:22,178
- Caffeine, caffeine...
- The tea makes you not be awake!

613
01:07:22,178 --> 01:07:23,790
Alcohol is that you
is being awake.

614
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,819
No, alcohol gives you sleep.
At least I give.

615
01:07:25,819 --> 01:07:28,473
Not do anything. No need
much to put you to sleep.

616
01:07:28,473 --> 01:07:31,006
Since not drink with your cooked...

617
01:07:32,819 --> 01:07:35,324
- What they are up to?
- What you mean? Nothing.

618
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:40,393
All.
Something.

619
01:07:40,393 --> 01:07:43,460
- Imbeciles playful...
- He's bothering her?

620
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,799
No... as you can see.

621
01:07:45,799 --> 01:07:47,017
Thank you, buddy.

622
01:07:48,341 --> 01:07:50,503
- They're together?
- None of your business.

623
01:07:50,503 --> 01:07:53,479
- Like them well done?
- Disappears, can head!

624
01:07:53,479 --> 01:07:56,662
Now I was upset.
Is drunk?

625
01:07:56,662 --> 01:07:59,075
Want to take a complaint
disrespect Condo authority?

626
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,787
- Was in the Army?
- Yes...

627
01:08:01,787 --> 01:08:04,409
- I'm a soldier.
- What war was?

628
01:08:04,409 --> 01:08:06,255
At all.

629
01:08:06,255 --> 01:08:11,392
I am in constant war with gray.

630
01:08:11,392 --> 01:08:14,138
Only becomes the
little minds.

631
01:08:14,138 --> 01:08:16,842
But it's out of fashion...

632
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:20,297
- You having fun?
- Yes, we are to have fun.

633
01:08:20,297 --> 01:08:23,054
- Put garbage in the bin, please.
- Sorry, Officer.

634
01:08:23,054 --> 01:08:27,990
- My father was in the army.
- Yup? God... God bless you.

635
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:30,497
Died to wear that uniform.

636
01:08:30,497 --> 01:08:33,877
This? Is that this is the Victorian era.

637
01:08:33,877 --> 01:08:37,444
His father died to deal with donkeys
or clear skies?

638
01:08:37,444 --> 01:08:39,980
- Not You...
- Stay away, not worth being.

639
01:08:40,793 --> 01:08:44,726
You're a disgrace to all
men who used this uniform.

640
01:08:45,783 --> 01:08:49,154
Take it.

641
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:09,294
Put yourself walking...
in your bike.

642
01:09:09,294 --> 01:09:12,106
I have no bike...
do not have bike.

643
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,010
Them you should not have given
your coat.

644
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:17,346
You should not have given them.

645
01:09:18,949 --> 01:09:23,526
You do not know how.
You never had to go through this.

646
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:26,468
No need to talk about it.

647
01:09:31,422 --> 01:09:34,521
<i>- It was a great concert, amazing.
- Yes</i>

648
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:37,997
It is said that the very Paul McCartney
recommended you personally.

649
01:09:37,997 --> 01:09:40,521
There are only two bands
represent England.

650
01:09:40,521 --> 01:09:43,230
- Who is the other?
- The The Who are the other.

651
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:45,171
Of course... yes...

652
01:09:45,171 --> 01:09:48,283
Monterey... never been there!
Is hot?

653
01:09:48,283 --> 01:09:51,266
No, it's Northern California.
But do not worry about it.

654
01:09:51,266 --> 01:09:54,480
Should I buy a matching jacket.
Do you think I should buy a coat?

655
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,544
- We should go buy new coats!
- Who else is playing?

656
01:09:58,525 --> 01:10:03,365
Otis Redding, The Mamas & the Papas...
is the thing John Phillips.

657
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:04,025
Yes, I know.

658
01:10:04,025 --> 01:10:06,429
The The Who, as I said.

659
01:10:06,429 --> 01:10:10,624
Refferson Airplane... and you.

660
01:10:13,245 --> 01:10:17,683
Jimi! Come on, give me a smile
, son!

661
01:10:18,394 --> 01:10:20,077
- Today is a good day.
- Yes, yes...

662
01:10:20,077 --> 01:10:22,015
It's a great day.

663
01:10:23,227 --> 01:10:27,634
<i>You know, playing guitar is about what you do on stage
</i>

664
01:10:27,634 --> 01:10:30,353
<i>Electric're up there</i>

665
01:10:30,353 --> 01:10:32,950
<i>not want to know anything else
</i>

666
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:36,773
<i>Come that energy, all the feel
</i>

667
01:10:36,773 --> 01:10:39,039
<i>I think we should just... < / i>

668
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:45,871
<i>It was what I expected. The beginning of a new era
</i>

669
01:11:08,302 --> 01:11:10,787
Go again to put it in place.

670
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,642
What are you doing?

671
01:11:20,146 --> 01:11:25,694
- What time is it?
- I do not know... a couple.

672
01:11:25,694 --> 01:11:27,394
Two hours...

673
01:11:28,724 --> 01:11:32,518
The Salvation Army Band is
playing outside. Let's hear?

674
01:11:38,512 --> 01:11:43,457
- I want out.
- Yes, alright...

675
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:48,204
I want to go out with you.

676
01:11:52,498 --> 01:11:54,899
's Two hours!

677
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,652
I heard you at first.

678
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:02,037
It's two hours and you stay sitting there.
You look good. Never want to leave!

679
01:12:02,037 --> 01:12:06,323
- Woman, play every night.
- You play music, that's not socializing.

680
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:08,207
Do not give me shit, come on.

681
01:12:08,207 --> 01:12:12,575
- I want to hang out with people!
- I do not hang out with people!

682
01:12:12,575 --> 01:12:15,932
It makes me feel uncomfortable.
You're just saying shit and balelas.

683
01:12:15,932 --> 01:12:18,022
I leave you embarrassed?
I'm always on the bullshit!

684
01:12:18,022 --> 01:12:20,901
But if you do not speak the Dylan or
Howlin 'Wolf not you care in the conversation!

685
01:12:20,901 --> 01:12:22,537
There are other things that we can talk
, you know?

686
01:12:22,537 --> 01:12:27,569
Okay, what you want to talk?
Do you want to talk? Speaks.

687
01:12:34,853 --> 01:12:36,540
I have friends!

688
01:12:38,023 --> 01:12:40,652
- Right...
- I have people who leave.

689
01:12:43,417 --> 01:12:45,706
For God's sake...
I'm sick of it.

690
01:12:46,642 --> 01:12:51,953
<i>". No short arms, so I'm cool
You're bored, that's what you are!"</i>

691
01:12:59,806 --> 01:13:03,236
<i>Buster...
Fuck you </i>.

692
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:19,014
You know what?
Sai but is already here!

693
01:13:21,852 --> 01:13:23,630
I'm not to put up with this shit
.

694
01:14:09,957 --> 01:14:13,673
- Is it good? You like?
- Yes, yes... like, it's cool.

695
01:14:13,673 --> 01:14:15,350
It is about what?

696
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:20,428
"The City and the Stars" talks about
a being super smart coming from the universe.

697
01:14:20,428 --> 01:14:23,481
It is just there, you know?
Condo hold.

698
01:14:23,481 --> 01:14:27,647
And one day will descend from space and
save us all from ourselves.

699
01:14:27,647 --> 01:14:31,780
And teach us... not to hate, but to love
even seriously.

700
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:33,334
This is profound.

701
01:14:33,334 --> 01:14:35,607
- I know, it seriously.
- Oh, yeah?

702
01:14:35,607 --> 01:14:38,602
Yes, there are a lot of things out there that do not even know
.

703
01:14:38,602 --> 01:14:42,330
As other people in other solar systems
they've got the same things as us.

704
01:14:43,421 --> 01:14:46,218
No bad feelings, you know?

705
01:14:46,218 --> 01:14:50,409
It is as if our negative vibrations from affecting
the way you live.

706
01:14:50,409 --> 01:14:54,634
- It's all...
- Yes, negativity betrays us...

707
01:14:54,634 --> 01:14:57,522
Yes, but the solar system is
undergo a massive change.

708
01:14:57,522 --> 01:15:00,300
Will affect land within
thirty years.

709
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:04,970
And our friends are gonna
space come and show us the way.

710
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:07,608
- The path?
- Yes...

711
01:15:08,185 --> 01:15:09,926
In fact...

712
01:15:15,038 --> 01:15:16,277
What are you doing?

713
01:15:16,277 --> 01:15:18,490
- We were just...
- What did you? Jimi!

714
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:20,315
Jimi, wake up!
Opens ohos!

715
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:22,130
What you this?
Jimi, come on, get up.

716
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:23,774
Wake up! Jimi, wake up!

717
01:15:23,774 --> 01:15:25,291
Only smoke some herb.

718
01:15:25,291 --> 01:15:26,881
Jimi, you have to get up now.
Get out of here!

719
01:15:26,881 --> 01:15:28,310
You have to get up, come on!

720
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:31,645
No, everything's cool.
We just hang out.

721
01:15:35,235 --> 01:15:38,973
- I miss you.
- We were just talking.

722
01:15:38,973 --> 01:15:42,551
We talked about child stars,
and science fiction.

723
01:15:42,551 --> 01:15:45,713
He wanted me to stay with him until you arrived
.

724
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:49,352
Would you stay with it?
He just buy it.

725
01:15:49,352 --> 01:15:51,735
Okay...

726
01:15:53,123 --> 01:15:55,168
I realize...

727
01:15:56,681 --> 01:15:58,736
- You're cool, you can stay.
- No, I'm fine.

728
01:15:58,736 --> 01:16:01,578
No, it's okay.

729
01:16:02,889 --> 01:16:04,562
Okay.

730
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:11,879
- I saw him play. It's good.
- That's incredible.

731
01:16:11,879 --> 01:16:14,375
Yes, it will be a rock star
one day.

732
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:16,886
He is a rock star.
It is one.

733
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:21,230
- Okay...
- Where does that accent?

734
01:16:21,230 --> 01:16:23,792
- Milwaukee.
- I do not know.

735
01:16:23,792 --> 01:16:25,878
There's nothing to know.

736
01:16:25,878 --> 01:16:30,297
- They're together Condo long?
- Since coming since September.

737
01:16:30,297 --> 01:16:32,300
This is a long time in
years groupie.

738
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:34,291
I'm not a groupie,
'm his girlfriend.

739
01:16:34,291 --> 01:16:36,620
Well... girlfriend,
fine.

740
01:16:37,835 --> 01:16:39,322
What is the secret?

741
01:16:39,322 --> 01:16:41,259
Us plenty of fun.

742
01:16:41,259 --> 01:16:43,890
We are always happy.
That's the secret.

743
01:16:44,804 --> 01:16:48,005
You should see what I fled.
God...

744
01:16:48,005 --> 01:16:52,556
Teeth direitinhos and conversation
complex. Boring...

745
01:16:52,556 --> 01:16:55,422
The easiest are always
the most boring.

746
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:01,954
You've been with some
rock star?

747
01:17:01,954 --> 01:17:05,389
- Yes, I've been to many.
- What was the most durable?

748
01:17:06,765 --> 01:17:11,951
Once was with the same type
a five and half months.

749
01:17:11,951 --> 01:17:15,945
Five and a half!
Yes...

750
01:17:15,945 --> 01:17:19,270
- What happened?
- Met a prettier girl.

751
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:23,160
But without problem.
I met a musician even better.

752
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,457
Turns all r Returns the largest
and better.

753
01:17:25,457 --> 01:17:27,664
But do not have to worry about that you
.

754
01:17:27,664 --> 01:17:29,902
Why will not know
a better musician?

755
01:17:29,902 --> 01:17:33,056
Because he will never know
prettiest girl.

756
01:17:35,661 --> 01:17:37,997
<i>We are not even
tables, my</i>

757
01:17:37,997 --> 01:17:41,931
Not we played in the Top 100
or anything, man.

758
01:17:41,931 --> 01:17:44,517
The newspaper needs to associate
music to a face!

759
01:17:44,517 --> 01:17:47,026
You need to be seen there.

760
01:17:47,026 --> 01:17:50,386
No, you said that if we are to consecrate
have to conquer London.

761
01:17:50,386 --> 01:17:53,483
- Was what you said!
- We won half of London!

762
01:17:53,483 --> 01:17:55,785
But we are at risk if
not conquer America.

763
01:17:55,785 --> 01:17:57,580
What is wrong with you, man?

764
01:17:57,580 --> 01:18:00,154
You start with one thing and you end
another bullshit any.

765
01:18:00,154 --> 01:18:02,320
- What is it, man?
- I'm you to cheat!

766
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,012
Not with the place where the disk is
!

767
01:18:05,012 --> 01:18:08,469
Look, I gave everything I had
to bring us where we are today.

768
01:18:08,469 --> 01:18:11,104
Spent up at the last pound
to bring us here.

769
01:18:11,104 --> 01:18:14,110
- So this is about you?
- It's about the payment.

770
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:18,183
For me, yes. And for you.
For us, for the guys.

771
01:18:18,183 --> 01:18:23,453
100 songs, my...
Not one!

772
01:18:23,453 --> 01:18:26,432
Hold to Monterey.

773
01:18:27,688 --> 01:18:29,027
Can be?

774
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:33,194
- Could be?
- Yes... yes, my... yes.

775
01:18:50,689 --> 01:18:52,409
I like him, though.

776
01:18:52,409 --> 01:18:56,347
You know, you should let it grow
wild, like an angel.

777
01:18:56,347 --> 01:18:59,212
I'll leave.
I have not cut the most.

778
01:18:59,212 --> 01:19:03,803
And do as before,
put ointment.

779
01:19:03,803 --> 01:19:06,689
- Yes...
- control it.

780
01:19:06,689 --> 01:19:08,271
Casts well your face.

781
01:19:08,271 --> 01:19:10,045
<i>not seem remotely different
</i>

782
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,841
I brought someone to see you.

783
01:19:31,981 --> 01:19:33,695
- What's up, man?
- How are you?

784
01:19:34,596 --> 01:19:36,351
Enter.

785
01:19:39,115 --> 01:19:42,816
You know Jimi, right?
Will be a rock star one day.

786
01:19:42,816 --> 01:19:46,412
Oh, wait. He is a rock star
!

787
01:19:46,412 --> 01:19:49,124
It's what your girlfriend
say, right?

788
01:19:49,124 --> 01:19:51,344
Why do not you get to Jimi
some herb you have?

789
01:19:58,904 --> 01:20:02,013
- Damn...
- We have many guests.

790
01:20:02,013 --> 01:20:05,654
- Where are the papers?
- In the drawer, where are forever.

791
01:20:09,401 --> 01:20:13,453
I saw you play. Jimi Hendrix, yes...
Very good.

792
01:20:15,568 --> 01:20:18,224
So, what do you think of London?

793
01:20:19,092 --> 01:20:22,933
- It's a good scene.
- A good scene?

794
01:20:23,901 --> 01:20:26,491
And where is this good scene?

795
01:20:26,491 --> 01:20:30,635
I touch the Scotch... and Bag O'Nails
the other night, man.

796
01:20:30,635 --> 01:20:33,389
- The people there are very cool.
- Yup?

797
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:37,464
Here appreciate how music
different than in America.

798
01:20:37,464 --> 01:20:41,168
In America still... still
all separate in America.

799
01:20:41,168 --> 01:20:45,210
There is a scene for a type of music,
and one scene to another kind of music.

800
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:50,127
And when you try to mix everything
are uncomfortable with you, you know?

801
01:20:50,127 --> 01:20:54,037
Here, just...
They give you more freedom to play!

802
01:20:54,037 --> 01:21:00,759
And love it. You-let do what
want, when you want.

803
01:21:00,759 --> 01:21:04,137
- What? They leave you?
- Yes

804
01:21:04,698 --> 01:21:08,652
Sorry, but you just said
you have freedom to play..

805
01:21:08,652 --> 01:21:14,353
When there is freedom nobody leaves you
do anything, you just do.

806
01:21:17,445 --> 01:21:19,011
There's nothing in the drawer.

807
01:21:19,011 --> 01:21:22,440
Is within the drawer.
Better search.

808
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:27,298
But you know that... good for you.
Vieste, you are have fun.

809
01:21:27,298 --> 01:21:31,112
In the name of England, good in
name of black England...

810
01:21:31,112 --> 01:21:33,879
- Welcome.
- Thank U.

811
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:39,776
Seems to me that you had not much
chance to see the black England.

812
01:21:39,776 --> 01:21:41,266
Bridgestone, Notting Hill...

813
01:21:41,266 --> 01:21:45,555
not divide things as black or white
England.

814
01:21:45,555 --> 01:21:48,000
But... it is so.

815
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,172
They divide.

816
01:21:50,172 --> 01:21:54,172
Or perhaps you have not had your
share of threats here.

817
01:21:54,172 --> 01:21:57,745
I read what the newspapers say
your music.

818
01:21:57,745 --> 01:22:00,933
"Wild, tribal, violent..."

819
01:22:02,074 --> 01:22:04,204
words, my...
They're just words.

820
01:22:04,204 --> 01:22:07,409
They're just words.
To me not bore me the words.

821
01:22:07,409 --> 01:22:12,880
But do not use when talking about
Jeff Beck or Eric Clapton.

822
01:22:14,322 --> 01:22:18,556
When they play blues is acceptable.
But as you touch blues...

823
01:22:18,556 --> 01:22:23,858
You're a violent abomination
and black. Thank U.

824
01:22:25,203 --> 01:22:27,114
England is different
America.

825
01:22:27,961 --> 01:22:32,121
Our problems with
racism are more... subtle.

826
01:22:33,373 --> 01:22:36,258
This new
England was built in the Windrush.

827
01:22:36,258 --> 01:22:38,558
Have you heard that?
You do not know what it is?

828
01:22:38,558 --> 01:22:40,962
- The Windrush?
- No, never heard.

829
01:22:40,962 --> 01:22:46,829
After the war, the Caribs...
and the Indians of the West

830
01:22:46,829 --> 01:22:50,943
were brought to England.

831
01:22:50,943 --> 01:22:54,968
That's why you see ads all over the
side labor and employment.

832
01:22:54,968 --> 01:22:58,323
"Come here, work
hard for a better life."

833
01:22:58,323 --> 01:23:02,110
- These are new possibilities.
- But there was no possibilities.

834
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:05,605
Not exist or decent accommodation
payments.

835
01:23:05,605 --> 01:23:08,697
- There is a class system here.
- Notting Hill, my...

836
01:23:08,697 --> 01:23:12,381
It was hard work, yes.
But anything better life.

837
01:23:12,381 --> 01:23:15,320
Yes, but it is difficult to
all, right?

838
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:18,761
People are just people.
They're like animals.

839
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:20,884
The animals are animals, right?

840
01:23:20,884 --> 01:23:25,110
The stick his nose where it is not
due to smell the heavens of the other...

841
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:26,816
Yes, animals are animals.
Even animals have never been...

842
01:23:29,894 --> 01:23:34,033
Look... I say this from brother to brother
, okay?

843
01:23:34,033 --> 01:23:40,419
For they are not more than just
curiosity. And that's the truth.

844
01:23:40,419 --> 01:23:45,477
They make you not go to the stage,
they want you there. In the electric chair.

845
01:23:45,477 --> 01:23:47,067
This is low, man.

846
01:23:47,067 --> 01:23:52,567
You've been playing with whitey, when are
British blacks who need inspiration.

847
01:23:52,567 --> 01:23:55,491
- Inspiration, my...
- Why do you think joke?

848
01:23:55,491 --> 01:23:57,975
- I can you tell me what I am...
- You could be a symbol.

849
01:23:57,975 --> 01:23:59,947
I do not understand, what you're talking?

850
01:23:59,947 --> 01:24:02,353
- You could be a symbol.
- Just play guitar.

851
01:24:02,353 --> 01:24:05,356
- Plays music for your people.
- My people?

852
01:24:06,092 --> 01:24:08,531
They're all my people.
What...

853
01:24:08,531 --> 01:24:10,410
Each of them are my people.

854
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:14,359
Jimi... people around you
this time, do not understand.

855
01:24:14,359 --> 01:24:20,994
If you go up on stage just to be there
, you are wasting you.

856
01:24:20,994 --> 01:24:23,336
Music should represent
protest notes.

857
01:24:23,336 --> 01:24:24,721
No doubt, man.

858
01:24:24,721 --> 01:24:28,048
The protest is everywhere.
Everyone wants solutions now.

859
01:24:28,048 --> 01:24:31,687
Okay, so you go up on stage with
all stratagems, is this the solution?

860
01:24:31,687 --> 01:24:34,297
I'm sick to speak of stratagems.

861
01:24:34,297 --> 01:24:37,866
World not just a big fat
ploy.

862
01:24:37,866 --> 01:24:40,892
Wars, you know? Napalm bombs
and all that stuff...

863
01:24:40,892 --> 01:24:43,956
You have people who are burned
direct on TV.

864
01:24:43,956 --> 01:24:45,658
Right across our faces Rs.

865
01:24:45,658 --> 01:24:48,867
All this violence...
is not my scene, man.

866
01:24:48,867 --> 01:24:51,623
Okay, so what?
To sit down and do nothing?

867
01:24:51,623 --> 01:24:55,218
It would be like you.
Faria exactly the same as you.

868
01:24:55,218 --> 01:24:58,080
Said shit and smoking weed.

869
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:01,726
The herb is good, but the shit you say my...

870
01:25:01,726 --> 01:25:04,475
Do you really want to change things?

871
01:25:04,475 --> 01:25:10,447
When the power of love takes
love for power, that's where things change.

872
01:25:18,601 --> 01:25:24,042
29, 1967
SPALDING MAY, LINCOLNSHIRE

873
01:25:30,701 --> 01:25:32,968
Toca something!

874
01:25:33,525 --> 01:25:35,034
Plays a fucking song!

875
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:40,911
Come on, buddy!
Where is the show?

876
01:25:40,911 --> 01:25:45,243
- I paid to see this shit.
- Cala me that...

877
01:25:45,243 --> 01:25:48,347
"Characterized by awkward silence,
tuning guitar obsessive,

878
01:25:48,347 --> 01:25:53,756
And obscene gestures, the fans think what
lost musically during this concert. "

879
01:25:53,756 --> 01:25:55,368
- Jimi...
- is not in tune, my

880
01:25:55,368 --> 01:25:56,400
Toca something, my

881
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,378
Get thee.. . fuck, I'll tune this guitar
not to take me all night

882
01:25:59,378 --> 01:26:03,270
"On hearing the first album,
the answer is. little"

883
01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:07,933
"Jimi Hendrix is not a great composer
not a great singer. "

884
01:26:07,933 --> 01:26:12,981
" is solemn when you're not angry.
Vago, when it's not archaic. "

885
01:26:12,981 --> 01:26:17,191
" The quality of the songs is equivalent to
the purism of their letters. "

886
01:26:17,191 --> 01:26:22,958
"The song that gives title to the album is
little lyrical and unambiguously primary."

887
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:26,939
You're really facing
play any shit, right?

888
01:26:26,939 --> 01:26:31,741
Not you care how it sounds.
Go away then, my!

889
01:26:31,741 --> 01:26:36,809
- Do not take long, did you?
- The single or revenge in America.

890
01:26:36,809 --> 01:26:40,479
- And together you a critique of these...
- I do not mean anything.

891
01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:43,051
I can already see the movie.

892
01:26:43,051 --> 01:26:46,825
The people asking me if
he deserved the invitation to Monterey.

893
01:26:46,825 --> 01:26:51,148
Why are we here ?!
Why do all this?

894
01:26:51,148 --> 01:26:53,041
Mitch?

895
01:26:57,603 --> 01:27:01,353
- Where's your girlfriend?
- I do not know.

896
01:27:02,716 --> 01:27:04,888
She stopped a lot around here.

897
01:27:04,888 --> 01:27:09,767
There are people sigh you
ears. The fill-in...

898
01:27:09,767 --> 01:27:12,217
I do not even want to know.

899
01:27:12,217 --> 01:27:16,024
It's a lack of respect, you know?

900
01:27:16,024 --> 01:27:18,749
Escape you will...

901
01:27:18,749 --> 01:27:21,027
The Jimi should be
Subtle touch the theater.

902
01:27:21,027 --> 01:27:25,875
Brian Epstein wants to celebrate the new album
Beatles and the boys are gonna be there.

903
01:27:25,875 --> 01:27:30,114
If Jimi has a performance like last time...

904
01:27:30,497 --> 01:27:35,090
We can lose Monterey. In a second
.

905
01:28:03,376 --> 01:28:04,995
Come here.

906
01:28:05,801 --> 01:28:08,814
- Come here. Arrives here.
- Go on.

907
01:28:12,737 --> 01:28:14,682
Sit down.
Sit with me.

908
01:28:14,682 --> 01:28:16,804
Come, sit down.

909
01:28:31,859 --> 01:28:34,362
- You want to come have a drink?
- I...

910
01:28:34,362 --> 01:28:36,455
No, she's fine.

911
01:28:36,455 --> 01:28:38,502
She does not want anything.

912
01:28:40,379 --> 01:28:41,765
Yes, I do not want anything.

913
01:28:41,765 --> 01:28:45,161
- See you in a bit.
- OK.

914
01:28:56,796 --> 01:29:01,411
I'll just call a person,
okay? I'll be back.

915
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:26,034
I am? Me.
Yes, dear.

916
01:29:26,034 --> 01:29:30,404
You come here? Yes, the site is good.
Is half full.

917
01:29:30,404 --> 01:29:33,419
More people will come here
a few hours.

918
01:29:51,365 --> 01:29:54,508
- Jimi, great show.
- Thank you very much.

919
01:29:54,508 --> 01:29:57,335
I have to go.
Thank you, thank you.

920
01:29:59,968 --> 01:30:02,242
What is this ?!
What is this?

921
01:30:06,177 --> 01:30:10,044
Fouls me concerning ?!
Who lines?

922
01:30:10,044 --> 01:30:11,612
Who were talking about?

923
01:30:11,612 --> 01:30:13,522
Fouls me concerning ?!

924
01:30:17,972 --> 01:30:19,811
I said to take
away!

925
01:30:48,216 --> 01:30:49,750
- You'll be fine.
- Yes.

926
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:52,242
- It will all be fine.
- Yes, thank you.

927
01:31:48,732 --> 01:31:52,770
- Are you cool?
- Should I take...

928
01:31:52,770 --> 01:31:57,141
Should I take these for pain.

929
01:31:57,141 --> 01:32:02,786
And these sleeping. Later
not now, I do not sleep tonight.

930
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,034
I wrote them for you.

931
01:32:21,594 --> 01:32:26,857
You write lyrics that have nothing
be with you and everything is supposed to be okay?

932
01:32:44,653 --> 01:32:46,634
I never doubted you.

933
01:32:46,634 --> 01:32:52,641
Was not me, it was you.
Was you... it was your chance!

934
01:32:58,029 --> 01:33:00,444
Only you can blame you.

935
01:33:02,603 --> 01:33:04,193
Is plotted.

936
01:33:05,034 --> 01:33:11,331
All in all, the blame
's all yours.

937
01:33:11,331 --> 01:33:16,019
You think to walk with a star
rock just behind fun.

938
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:21,620
It's them that make it real,
but never for themselves.

939
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:26,627
His whole life is to
fucking brooch.

940
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:30,544
You can not continue to think
on something that is not.

941
01:33:30,544 --> 01:33:35,741
He walk the fuck around. And later
or earlier back to fuck you.

942
01:33:36,879 --> 01:33:41,261
But it will not come back to fuck you,
will do it just to mess with you.

943
01:33:43,358 --> 01:33:46,906
Why would you say that? Why would you say such a thing
?

944
01:33:46,906 --> 01:33:49,633
Because I'm your sister.

945
01:33:49,633 --> 01:33:53,346
I will leave you to pieces
to think he loves you

946
01:33:53,346 --> 01:33:55,957
when in fact only
love yourself.

947
01:33:57,137 --> 01:34:01,874
Are you worn out, dear?
You seem to be.

948
01:34:02,796 --> 01:34:06,269
You know what you need?
Come here.

949
01:34:06,885 --> 01:34:10,462
Do you have any... let me see here
.

950
01:34:10,462 --> 01:34:13,236
Yes, you have some.

You know what? Let me take some

Take a few. Will put you to sleep
instantly.

I feel all...

955
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:36,709
If you need anything,
I'm really out there.

And I will do a solo at the end of
first verse, even before the chorus.

- All right.
- Even before the chorus?

972
01:40:06,768 --> 01:40:09,526
I like these pants.

Also, there's nothing there for you
. Not gonna like.

You know, I'll be back soon and.
It's nothing special, okay?

01:46:33,424 --> 01:46:38,540
Can act for a thousand people
but are not honest for one.

1007
01:46:39,696 --> 01:46:42,144
Can sing everything but...

1008
01:46:43,957 --> 01:46:47,565
Do not come between the lines.

1009
01:46:51,411 --> 01:46:54,039
Why do you want to go with you?

1010
01:46:58,397 --> 01:47:01,884
It makes me not go running
pack.

1011
01:47:01,884 --> 01:47:03,996
Good times.

1012
01:47:05,518 --> 01:47:08,505
We have a good time here.

1013
01:47:10,154 --> 01:47:14,784
It would not be anything... it's all
very restricted.

1014
01:47:14,784 --> 01:47:17,169
- It's all very formal?
- Yes.

1015
01:47:18,285 --> 01:47:21,792
- So how would there?
- More loose.

1016
01:47:21,792 --> 01:47:26,811
More  loose?
How uncertain?

1017
01:47:26,811 --> 01:47:33,840
When booting things, I think
if you will continue to notice my presence.

1018
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:40,358
Yes... of course.

1019
01:47:45,044 --> 01:47:51,095
Things you love are with you.
Whether you want it or not.

1020
01:47:55,924 --> 01:47:59,333
You have a disturbing way of being.

1021
01:48:00,174 --> 01:48:04,822
Very simple and profound.

1022
01:48:12,133 --> 01:48:18,086
I do not think it's a good idea
I go to Monterey.

1023
01:50:13,108 --> 01:50:16,046
<i>So, think themselves better than they</i>

1024
01:50:16,046 --> 01:50:21,673
<i>No, there's nothing to do with
be better or something like that</i>

1025
01:50:21,673 --> 01:50:23,204
<i > It has to do with inspiration</i>

1026
01:50:23,204 --> 01:50:26,596
<i>And I'm inspired by everyone,
by all kinds of people</i>

1027
01:50:26,596 --> 01:50:29,147
<i>For me it is art.</i>

1028
01:50:29,147 --> 01:50:34,992
<i>And this is to show something never seen before
, or something you see every day</i>

1029
01:50:34,992 --> 01:50:36,807
<i>Show it otherwise, you know </ i? >

1030
01:50:36,807 --> 01:50:40,085
<i>So I should be able to pick up on any song...
</i>

1031
01:50:40,085 --> 01:50:46,232
<i>Should I be able to undress and submit
in a way that never hast heard, you know?</i>

1032
01:50:46,232 --> 01:50:50,904
<i>It has everything to do with inspiration,
and inspire others</i>

1033
01:50:51,927 --> 01:50:59,623
