1
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:41,803
Stop. Stop.

2
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,337
Gary, what the fuck?

3
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,172
Court order
for asset seizure.

4
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,774
Pay your property taxes,
Maddie.

5
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:48,108
No, this is a mistake.

6
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,978
I'm negotiating
a payment schedule.

7
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,946
Guess they're done
negotiating.

8
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,314
So they take my car?
I'm an Uber driver.

9
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,750
Not my problem.

10
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:58,019
How am I supposed to pay
their taxes bartending?

11
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:01,154
My problem is that
you went radio silent on me.

12
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,991
Is that
what this is about?

13
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:07,061
No, I also have a contract with
the county, but I'm saying,

14
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,664
a little explanation about why
I never heard from you again

15
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,264
would've been nice.

16
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,166
You can't just ghost people.
Three months is not nothing.

17
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,639
Three months?
Felt longer. In a good way.

18
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:19,272
Wait, Gary, please stop.

19
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,708
You were right, okay?

20
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:23,578
My feelings were so intense
that I got scared.

21
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:25,245
I freaked out.

22
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,116
Is that true?

23
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,918
Of course it's true,
you big dummy.

24
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:33,855
Last night, I was doing laundry,
and I thought to myself:

25
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,858
"I miss that fucker.

26
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,627
I miss hearing about
what the Jets were doing wrong."

27
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:41,796
What you would do
differently

28
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,263
if you ran the team.

29
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:46,067
They'd be so much better.
So much better.

30
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,735
The other day,
I saw a green sock,

31
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:50,138
and I was like,
that's Gary's.

32
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,942
This feels good.

33
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:57,477
Just say my car wasn't here,
okay?

34
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:01,082
Yeah. You know what?

35
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:04,217
I will do that
because it's not gonna be here.

36
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,455
What...?
That's my cousin.

37
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:11,559
He's from Italy.

38
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:14,128
Gary, I swear to God,
he's my cousin.

39
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,531
Second cousin.
That's their culture.

40
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:20,333
Have you ever been to Italy?
I wanted closure, I got closure.

41
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:21,803
Thank you.
Gary, come on.

42
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:24,672
It was a fling.
No, no, it wasn't, not to me.

43
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:26,741
My sister was right about you.

44
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:30,712
Wait, your sister who
was arrested for elder abuse?

45
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:32,613
Okay, Gary.

46
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:34,782
There's something
seriously wrong with you.

47
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,752
You think you're so perfect?

48
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,021
You're indecisive,
which is annoying.

49
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,025
Okay, Gary, I'm sorry.
Will you drop me off?

50
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:46,127
I'm bartending
at the Claw today.

51
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,427
God. You know...

52
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,430
I just can't decide.

53
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:51,666
You're an asshole.

54
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,923
You think I chose this?

55
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,673
Hi, Gary. What can I get you?

56
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:34,809
Let me get a banana bread.

57
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,443
Actually. Wait, hold on.

58
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:39,479
I gotta go lemon loaf.

59
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,387
I'm gonna...

60
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,124
I want a heated...

61
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,496
That's gonna be 4.50.
Right.

62
00:05:01,102 --> 00:05:02,236
Um...

63
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,012
Come on.

64
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,852
Hey.

65
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,554
What the hell are you doing?

66
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,354
Trying to save my house!

67
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:30,765
- You got it?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

68
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:36,170
Oh. No. No, no, no.

69
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:42,543
Come on, man.

70
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:57,490
Aah...

71
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,359
Gotta get it together,
Maddie.

72
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,629
One more infraction
and you lose your license.

73
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,364
Lot of good a license is gonna
do me when I don't have a car.

74
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,334
My mom left me that house.

75
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,502
It's paid off.
Can they do this?

76
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:10,671
If you haven't paid your taxes,
they can.

77
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,372
So these rich fucks move in

78
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:15,243
and then our taxes triple?
Bullshit.

79
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,279
Good news is
you have till September 1st.

80
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:22,750
You'll pay it off.
Not without a car, man.

81
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:26,187
Any idea how much money I lose
every day I'm not Ubering?

82
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,256
Summer's when I make
my nut for the year.

83
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,257
I get it.

84
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,993
These people are moving in,

85
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:33,361
trying to push me out?

86
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,062
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

87
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,235
Course you do. Thanks.
Mm-hm.

88
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:43,237
See you on the water.
All right.

89
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:55,016
- Come on, dawg.
- You know how we do.

90
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,084
New house
is right on the water.

91
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:59,553
Tore down the old place.
Gotta come out.

92
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:01,756
G and T with lime.

93
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,457
Yeah, I take him out
on the boat, like, every day.

94
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:05,927
We're not open until noon.

95
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,063
Know what, bro?
Let me call you right back.

96
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:10,965
Um...

97
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,066
It is noon.

98
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,069
It's 11:57.

99
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:18,272
Got it.

100
00:07:20,074 --> 00:07:21,275
Now what time is it?

101
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,080
It's 11:56.

102
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:32,753
Give it back.
Why not wait on your boat?

103
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:34,956
I'll blow the foghorn
when we're open.

104
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:36,791
The fuck's wrong?
Just asked for a drink.

105
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:41,195
Hey, hey, hey. Stop that.
What is going on here?

106
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:44,098
Sir, I will make your drink
for you.

107
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,333
Good Lord.

108
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,768
Fuck that.
You need to fire her.

109
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:49,837
I can't.
She has a disability.

110
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:51,005
What? No, I don't.

111
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,373
You don't?
No.

112
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:53,808
That's the reason why
I hired you.

113
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:56,143
- Bullshit.
- You know what?

114
00:07:56,277 --> 00:08:00,147
We cannot start off
the summer like this, okay?

115
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:02,984
You could be a bitch
any other month of the year.

116
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:05,653
Be a bitch in October.
Be a bitch in March.

117
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,555
Don't be a bitch
in June. Okay?

118
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,190
These people
keep our lights on.

119
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,959
These people are the reason
I'm losing my house.

120
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:14,528
Sorry, Fern.
I'm having a shitty morning.

121
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:15,796
Yeah, I see that.

122
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,366
You know what helps me?

123
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,135
Folding napkins.

124
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,206
Oh, this car's only $1000.

125
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,042
Oh, no,
that's just the tires.

126
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,312
Not gonna find anything
on Craigslist. I've looked.

127
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,381
You could always
sell your kidney.

128
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:38,452
You could sell your hair,
your plasma, your eggs.

129
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:41,055
The human body's a cash cow.
People don't understand that.

130
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,858
Jim, I can feel our baby
getting dumber.

131
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,226
Just trying to help.

132
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,994
You could always
rent the house out.

133
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:50,197
No, ugh. I can't stand the
thought of those summer people

134
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:51,499
being in my house.

135
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,334
Oh. Hey, hey.
Look at this.

136
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,304
"Need a car for college?

137
00:08:57,438 --> 00:08:59,607
"Date our 19-year-old son
this summer.

138
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,375
"He's a wonderful young man,
extremely smart,

139
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,377
"but socially shy.

140
00:09:03,512 --> 00:09:05,346
"Never had a girlfriend.
We've tried everything.

141
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,947
"We're looking for
an attractive, kind,

142
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,683
"intelligent woman,
early to mid-20s,

143
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:11,852
"to date him and bring him
out of his shell

144
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:13,888
"before he leaves for college
in the fall.

145
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,023
"In exchange, we'll give you
a Buick Regal,

146
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:17,992
"clean, rust-free, 40K miles.

147
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,727
Serious inquiries only."

148
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,862
"Date" is in quotes.

149
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:24,698
- It's gotta be a joke, right?
- No.

150
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:27,101
Have you seen
these helicopter parents?

151
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,769
They'll do everything
for their kids.

152
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:31,205
Surprised they're not gonna
fuck him themselves.

153
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,274
It does say early
to mid-20s, though.

154
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,209
That's okay.
I can pass for that.

155
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,243
Okay.

156
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:38,245
You won't rent your house out,

157
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,748
but now you'll rent out
your vag?

158
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,383
The adults are talking.

159
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:45,019
Just 'cause I'm a guy,
I can't express an opinion?

160
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,487
Exactly. Yeah, shut up.
Yeah.

161
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,289
You have a Road Runner tattoo

162
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,623
covering your entire back.

163
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:50,958
Don't think
you should tell anybody

164
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,126
what to do
with their body.
Nope.

165
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,595
What about an OnlyFans page?

166
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,630
What's an OnlyFans page,
Jim?

167
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:00,067
That would take too long.
I need a car now.

168
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:02,803
Just surprised you're
considering this. That's all.

169
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:04,271
I've had
a one-night stand before

170
00:10:04,405 --> 00:10:05,806
and gotten zero Buick Regals
for it.

171
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,441
Babe,
you don't know this,

172
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:09,643
but women have all sorts
of reasons for having sex.

173
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:11,645
I had sex once because I didn't
want to commute in the morning.

174
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,216
I've had sex once to get out
of playing Settlers of Catan.

175
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:17,251
I had sex once on a first date

176
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,520
'cause I thought
he was gonna kill me.

177
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:19,588
Jesus.

178
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,955
You're with me now, babe.

179
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,790
She's talking about you,
dumbass.

180
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,729
Yeah! Epic!

181
00:10:28,863 --> 00:10:31,132
Waves are firing.
No tourists.

182
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:34,668
You guys are missing out.
It's probably not even real.

183
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,670
It would be the fastest way
to get a car.

184
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,272
Oh, yeah.

185
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:41,675
Kid would cream his shorts
as soon as he saw you.

186
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,777
Then you can
just drive right home.

187
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,614
Oh, my God.
Jim.

188
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,948
You want my opinion?

189
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:51,719
These people use us.
So why don't we use them?

190
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:55,356
I just know my mom would've
wanted me to save that house.

191
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,791
Yeah.
Things are so expensive now.

192
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:00,595
Think I wanna wait tables
after teaching kids all year?

193
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:01,996
Listen to me.

194
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,864
If you're really in a pinch,
you can use our van.

195
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:06,000
I'll send Sara
to fuck the kid instead.

196
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,701
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Jim.

197
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,670
Just trying to keep it light.

198
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,405
Think a kid wants
to have sex with you

199
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,140
in your current condition?

200
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:15,442
Get back into the sea.
Just opened a beer.

201
00:11:15,577 --> 00:11:17,344
Go to the sea.

202
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:20,582
It's cold as fuck--
Go in the ocean.

203
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,149
Might just keep paddling.

204
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,020
Maddie.

205
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,288
Oh, hi.
Hi.

206
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:08,757
Hey.

207
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,357
Any trouble finding the place?

208
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:11,559
No.

209
00:13:11,693 --> 00:13:13,827
No. Found it.

210
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,297
Oh, well,
welcome to our home.

211
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,734
I'm Allison
and this is my husband, Laird.

212
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,736
Layered? Like lasagna?

213
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:24,606
Lasagna? No. Laird.

214
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:26,508
Laird. Am I saying that right?

215
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:28,643
Yeah, one syllable. Laird.

216
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:30,477
Okay.

217
00:13:30,612 --> 00:13:33,548
Just call me Laird.
I can't.

218
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,816
So should I come up,
or do you wanna come down here?

219
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,752
Come on.
Yeah, come on up.

220
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:39,153
- That'd be great.
- Come on up.

221
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,034
I just want you to know,

222
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:57,471
we have the utmost respect
for sex workers.

223
00:13:57,605 --> 00:13:58,807
I am...

224
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:00,374
not a sex worker.

225
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:03,712
Not that there's anything wrong.
Oh, no.

226
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:08,382
So, Maddie,
tell us about yourself.

227
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:10,518
Where you from?
Here, actually.

228
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:12,019
Wow, a local.

229
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,287
I'm jealous, heh.

230
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,557
You live in paradise
all year long.

231
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,859
I meant to ask this on
the phone, but how old are you?

232
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,562
Well...

233
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:25,933
I know you were looking for
someone early to mid-20s.

234
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:29,169
I'm slightly older.
Right. How old?

235
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:30,304
I just turned 29.

236
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:31,740
Recently?
Last year.

237
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,508
So you're 29?
Last year.

238
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:36,276
And how old are you,
like, right now?

239
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,245
One more year older.
So 30.

240
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:40,147
Yeah. 32.

241
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,450
I...

242
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:44,652
May I be frank?

243
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:48,088
I'm assuming that I'm here

244
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,724
because you haven't
found anyone yet,

245
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:51,860
and the reason
you haven't found anyone yet

246
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:54,829
is because
young girls are idiots.

247
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:56,698
That's not their fault.
They're young.

248
00:14:56,831 --> 00:14:58,031
But...

249
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:00,934
this is your son
we're talking about.

250
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:04,905
What you need is someone
who looks like a peer,

251
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,742
but has the maturity
to be able to handle this

252
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:12,146
with the tact and sensitivity
the situation requires.

253
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,782
She's good.
Good.

254
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,283
Good answer.
Mm-hm.

255
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:19,486
We've just been so worried
about our son.

256
00:15:19,621 --> 00:15:23,525
Percy is so loving,
and he is so sensitive,

257
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:25,593
and he's extremely bright.

258
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:27,595
He's going to Princeton
next year.

259
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:29,263
Oh, I've heard of it.

260
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,432
He's an amazing musician,
but won't play for anyone.

261
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:34,268
He's just having
a lot of trouble socially.

262
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:35,603
You know, and as a mother,

263
00:15:35,737 --> 00:15:37,438
that's just been
really hard to watch

264
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:38,573
these past four years.

265
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:39,908
Always on his phone,

266
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,876
doesn't come out of his room,

267
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:45,312
he doesn't have any friends,
he doesn't talk to girls.

268
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:49,082
Doesn't drink, doesn't go
to parties, doesn't drive.

269
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,519
Doesn't do anything
that I did.

270
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:53,755
We can't send him
to college like that.

271
00:15:53,888 --> 00:15:55,222
He'd never make it.

272
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,826
Well, that's why
you called a professional.

273
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,428
Not a professional,
just a girl who needs a car.

274
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:05,767
Yeah.
We didn't come by this easily.

275
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,536
We tried everything
to bring him out of his shell.

276
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,070
We're at the end of our rope.

277
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:12,406
I was shy
when I was Percy's age.

278
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,309
But I dated this girl
before I went to college,

279
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,679
and she really opened me up
sexually.

280
00:16:17,812 --> 00:16:19,581
Okay. Mm-mm.
Barbara.

281
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:22,216
Anyway,
by the time I got to college,

282
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,985
I was out of my shell
and thriving.

283
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,688
Yes, and that's
what we want for Percy.

284
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:28,288
Is this him?

285
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:29,323
Yes.

286
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:34,629
- Wow, he's adorable.
- Isn't he?

287
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:36,463
Mm-hm.

288
00:16:36,598 --> 00:16:37,498
So...

289
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:39,466
how does this work?

290
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:42,135
The honor system
or...?

291
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,338
That, and we know
his passcode.
Mm-hm.

292
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:47,007
And he's not gay?

293
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,276
No. We've seen
his Internet history.

294
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,880
Yeah, the porn is graphic,
but not gay.

295
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:55,215
A little gay.
Large groups of people.
Hm.

296
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:56,518
Hm.

297
00:16:56,651 --> 00:16:59,253
Not to look a gift horse
in the mouth,

298
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,723
but does it have to be
a Buick?

299
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:03,858
It's just what Dad drove.
Mm.

300
00:17:03,992 --> 00:17:07,662
Okay, then, why don't you date
Percy and the Buick is yours?

301
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:10,532
And don't just "date" him,
you know?

302
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:12,332
Get to know him,
'cause he's a good kid.

303
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,736
So when you say date him,

304
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:18,673
do you mean date him
or date him?

305
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:21,141
Yes.
Yeah, that's correct.

306
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:22,977
Date him.
Date him hard.

307
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,411
Okay.

308
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:26,179
I'll date his brains out.

309
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,683
So is he in his room? Should I
jump out and surprise him?

310
00:17:28,816 --> 00:17:30,585
No. No, no, no.
He's not here.

311
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:32,887
He can't know about this.
Nobody can know about this.

312
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:36,223
Nobody can know about this.

313
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:37,424
Also,
it would devastate him,

314
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,893
which would
defeat the purpose

315
00:17:39,027 --> 00:17:40,695
of building up
his confidence.

316
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:42,229
Right. Right.

317
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,932
He volunteers
at the animal shelter

318
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,132
from 10 to 6.

319
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,568
We thought
maybe you could go

320
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:49,069
and act like
you wanna adopt a dog.

321
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,772
And I don't see this
happening,

322
00:17:50,905 --> 00:17:54,842
but if Percy dates somebody
the organic way...

323
00:17:54,976 --> 00:17:55,977
Got it.

324
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,444
Better get to work.
Yeah.

325
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:13,293
I'm drifting. I'm drifting,
I'm drifting, I'm drifting.

326
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,168
Hi. Can I interest you
in some unconditional love?

327
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:56,738
Looking for something
to slobber on you?

328
00:18:56,871 --> 00:18:59,107
Can he help me?

329
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:02,677
Well, he works with the dogs.
I deal with the people.

330
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:05,278
But you have a weird energy.

331
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:07,280
Don't worry,
I've been neutered.

332
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:08,916
I want him.

333
00:19:10,752 --> 00:19:12,452
Percy,
can you help this lady?

334
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,359
Mind if I touch your wiener?

335
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,361
What?
Your dog.

336
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,497
Oh.

337
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:24,532
Yeah.

338
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:26,601
Um...

339
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:27,969
How can I help you?

340
00:19:28,102 --> 00:19:29,704
Um, I wanna adopt a dog.

341
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,238
Oh, yeah. Sure.

342
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,242
Um... Great.

343
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:38,846
Um...

344
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,015
That's a cool cartoon.
It's anime.

345
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:44,351
Yeah, animated.
That's what I said.

346
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,154
Um, excuse me.
I need your help.

347
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,089
Oh! Sorry, sorry. Okay.

348
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:49,891
What kind of dog
are you looking to adopt?

349
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:52,026
I wish
I could adopt them all.

350
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,795
Which is the most fucked up?

351
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:58,066
Um, the most messed up
is Milo.

352
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,801
This is Milo. Um...

353
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:01,569
He's been here
the longest.

354
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,738
Um...

355
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,707
He was a drug dog
for the state police,

356
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,407
but they forced him
into retirement

357
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:10,645
because he got addicted
to C-O-C-A-I-N-E.

358
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:11,713
Cocaine?

359
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:13,581
No! Milo!

360
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:14,816
Milo. Milo.

361
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:18,052
If he hears the word,
he gets triggered.

362
00:20:18,186 --> 00:20:20,021
Sorry, Milo. I'm fresh out.
Heh, heh.

363
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:23,390
It's okay. It's okay. Um...

364
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:25,093
I have to ask you questions

365
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:28,328
just to make sure
you're a suitable candidate.

366
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:30,263
We do it with everyone.
It's the rules.

367
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,232
Oh,
a little rule follower, huh?

368
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:34,535
Yeah, they're super important.
Mm.

369
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:37,471
So is there, like,
an office or somewhere private?

370
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:40,007
An office.

371
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:41,743
Come right this way.
Great.

372
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,113
Maddie Barker.

373
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:48,482
I feel so far from you.

374
00:21:13,508 --> 00:21:15,475
Um...

375
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,577
Spouse?

376
00:21:17,545 --> 00:21:19,747
Um, currently single.

377
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:21,149
Thank God too.

378
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,684
You can just have more fun.
Be spontaneous.

379
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:25,720
"Unmarried."

380
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:27,221
Children?

381
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,289
No. God, no. Too young.

382
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,793
Having fun still. Meeting
new people. I love that.

383
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,995
"Childless."

384
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:37,965
Why do you want to adopt a dog?

385
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:40,201
Because I can't have dogs
of my own.

386
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:47,575
And what do you plan to do
with the dog if you move?

387
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,443
I'm not moving.
Well, if you did.

388
00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:52,780
I have lived here my whole life.
Not going anywhere.

389
00:21:52,914 --> 00:21:54,949
Oh, sorry. I di--
I didn't mean to pry.

390
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:56,617
No. Pry.

391
00:21:57,718 --> 00:21:58,986
Pry me open.

392
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:04,592
Um...

393
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:09,396
Oh, what? Already?

394
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:11,732
Um, okay. Sorry.

395
00:22:11,866 --> 00:22:14,001
I'll have to send this
application up to my supervisor.

396
00:22:14,135 --> 00:22:16,336
Come on.
Gotta be more questions.

397
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:19,640
Yes, there are, but, um,
I have to start closing up.

398
00:22:19,774 --> 00:22:22,409
So, um, yeah. You can come back
another day, though.

399
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:24,679
I might not want a dog
another day.

400
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:27,480
I want a dog right now.

401
00:22:27,615 --> 00:22:30,284
Well, then, pet ownership
may not be for you.

402
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:32,854
You sound a lot like
the kind of person

403
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:36,389
we would normally
take a dog from.

404
00:22:37,825 --> 00:22:39,392
How about I give you
a ride home?

405
00:22:39,527 --> 00:22:40,995
And we can keep talking?

406
00:22:41,128 --> 00:22:44,632
You're on the way.
How do you know where I live?

407
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:46,167
Your parents told me.

408
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,970
What?
It's on your school bag.

409
00:22:51,272 --> 00:22:53,274
Oh, heh.

410
00:22:54,876 --> 00:22:56,177
Everything under control?

411
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,712
Um, hey, Crispin,

412
00:22:57,845 --> 00:23:00,413
what's the company policy
about leaving early?

413
00:23:00,548 --> 00:23:02,984
It's like we super can't
do that, right?

414
00:23:03,117 --> 00:23:05,219
Would that be, you know,
frowned upon?

415
00:23:05,353 --> 00:23:07,355
Oh, come on. Let's go.

416
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:08,756
Okay.

417
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,924
Okay.

418
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:11,692
You can finish alone,
right?

419
00:23:11,826 --> 00:23:13,393
Bet you do it all the time.
Uh...

420
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:14,929
Thanks.

421
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:15,997
Bye.

422
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:18,699
Okay, then.

423
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:19,734
Approved.

424
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:26,941
That's your car?
It is for tonight.

425
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,778
Actually, um, you know what?

426
00:23:30,912 --> 00:23:32,445
This sucks,
but I just remembered

427
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,382
I rode my bike here, so...

428
00:23:34,515 --> 00:23:36,918
This is what--
I'll go on this.

429
00:23:37,051 --> 00:23:38,052
Well, that's okay.

430
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:43,224
I can just throw it
in the back.

431
00:23:43,357 --> 00:23:44,592
You can ride up front with me.

432
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,965
Oh, come on. I won't bite.

433
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:54,568
Unless you want me to.

434
00:23:58,372 --> 00:24:01,309
Okay. But no biting.

435
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,214
I mean, whatever. I've been
with girls a couple times.

436
00:24:07,348 --> 00:24:08,883
Where's the rest of
my seat belt?

437
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:10,685
It's a lap belt.

438
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:14,221
Pretend you're on an airplane.
I'll be your flight attendant.

439
00:24:14,355 --> 00:24:16,524
Why is the flight attendant
flying the plane?

440
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:18,726
I've killed the pilot
and taken over the plane.

441
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:19,927
You're my hostage.

442
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:34,508
This isn't the way to my house.
It's a shortcut.

443
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:52,793
Give me that.
What are you doing?

444
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:55,930
Our generation
and our phones, huh?

445
00:24:58,632 --> 00:24:59,700
We're home.

446
00:25:01,802 --> 00:25:02,803
Okay.

447
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:06,640
Ooh.

448
00:25:06,774 --> 00:25:08,976
What you got down there?

449
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,044
Something for me?

450
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:16,417
Oh, fuck! Ugh!

451
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:29,330
Why?

452
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:30,831
You tried kidnapping me!

453
00:25:30,965 --> 00:25:33,901
I can't kidnap you.
You're 19. Grow up.

454
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:36,337
You put me in a van
and took my phone.

455
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,838
If I were kidnapping you,

456
00:25:37,972 --> 00:25:40,641
would I give
my personal information first?

457
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:43,512
Why couldn't you have used
your rape whistle?

458
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:45,046
Why would I have
a rape whistle?

459
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,848
Why do you have fucking Mace?

460
00:25:47,982 --> 00:25:49,383
Sorry.

461
00:25:49,518 --> 00:25:52,319
Will you get the hose, please?
Please.

462
00:25:55,723 --> 00:25:58,959
Uh... Uh, it's broken.
Is the water on?

463
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:01,896
You have to turn the water on?
Are you fucking with me?

464
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:04,231
Maybe it was already on.
The spigot.

465
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:06,033
The spigot.
Oh, okay.

466
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:07,234
God.

467
00:26:07,368 --> 00:26:08,269
Oh!

468
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:13,207
God. Fuck.

469
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,942
Stop spraying me with it.
I'm sorry.

470
00:26:15,076 --> 00:26:16,577
I'm trying to help.
I'm sorry.

471
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:20,815
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

472
00:26:20,948 --> 00:26:22,683
I'm sorry.

473
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:24,218
I'm sorry.

474
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:25,953
I didn't know
what you were trying to do.

475
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:28,622
I just thought you were hot.

476
00:26:28,756 --> 00:26:29,790
You think I'm hot?

477
00:26:29,924 --> 00:26:33,594
Yeah. I think you're super hot.

478
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:36,263
Um, uh... Maybe we
should go on a date, then?

479
00:26:37,998 --> 00:26:39,433
I'll go throw another dress on.

480
00:26:39,568 --> 00:26:41,402
Oh, no, I didn't mean now.
I meant,

481
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,871
you know, t-tomorrow.
Like...

482
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:44,939
a real date.

483
00:26:45,072 --> 00:26:45,973
Oh.

484
00:26:47,108 --> 00:26:48,976
Yeah, that's better.

485
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,111
Okay.

486
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:51,178
Tomorrow, then.

487
00:26:57,118 --> 00:26:58,252
Thank you for the ride.

488
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:01,822
Bye.

489
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:08,896
Ugh. Can't believe
this kid is going to Princeton.

490
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,064
He's dumb as shit.

491
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:11,499
He's just afraid
of the world.

492
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:13,834
They all are.
Grew up in bubble wrap.

493
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:16,137
My cousin, she's 20.
Still lives at home.

494
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,005
Won't go outside
without a helmet.

495
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:20,509
It might be
a medical thing.

496
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:23,644
The problem is the parents.
They baby him.

497
00:27:23,777 --> 00:27:26,480
Anyway, I'll need the van
tonight for my big date.

498
00:27:26,615 --> 00:27:27,948
No.
What?

499
00:27:28,082 --> 00:27:30,684
No. Gonna take me a week
to air that thing out.

500
00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:33,154
Sara's pregnant. I can't have
her breathing those fumes.

501
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:35,322
Ask Fern
to borrow that Claw car.

502
00:27:37,258 --> 00:27:38,692
That'll drop his panties.

503
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,698
Hey, Mel.
Hi, Mel.

504
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:46,635
Hey, guys.

505
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:48,202
Did you hear about Mel?

506
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:52,039
She got herself a sugar daddy.
You could do that.

507
00:27:52,173 --> 00:27:55,176
Then you wouldn't have to worry
about a car or property taxes.

508
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:59,113
No. No way I'm gonna be on call
to some rich asshole all summer.

509
00:27:59,246 --> 00:28:03,184
If you see me doing that, it
means I've compromised who I am,

510
00:28:03,317 --> 00:28:06,353
and you can kill me
because I've given up.

511
00:28:06,487 --> 00:28:09,558
I should have this Buick by now,
but this kid is unfuckable.

512
00:28:55,604 --> 00:28:58,872
Well, you look like
an accountant in the Bahamas.

513
00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:02,776
Heh,
it was too hot for pants.

514
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,281
Hi.
Hi.

515
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:10,117
I'm so glad we're doing this.
A date was a great idea.

516
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:11,752
Am I allowed to be here?

517
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:13,454
Oh, yeah. I know the owner.
It's fine.

518
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:15,389
It's just that I'm not 21.

519
00:29:15,523 --> 00:29:16,890
That doesn't matter here.

520
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:18,892
I think it's a federal law,
but, heh--

521
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:25,499
Where is the waitress?

522
00:29:25,634 --> 00:29:28,737
I just hope my parents
don't find out that I'm here.

523
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:29,803
Do they come here?

524
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,606
No, no. They track my phone.

525
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,576
Wow, okay.
Do they microchip you too?

526
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:39,179
There she is, the Flash.

527
00:29:39,313 --> 00:29:40,682
What do you want, Maddie?

528
00:29:40,814 --> 00:29:43,585
Uh, a Long Island iced tea
for me, and...

529
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:45,587
Pepsi, please.
We only have Coke.

530
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,621
Oh.

531
00:29:48,255 --> 00:29:50,759
Do you wanna go somewhere else?
No, Percy.

532
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:52,960
He'll have
a Long Island iced tea too.

533
00:29:53,093 --> 00:29:54,028
Okay.

534
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:55,095
Thank you.

535
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:00,568
I'm really tense.

536
00:30:00,702 --> 00:30:03,404
Why? Is everything okay?
Yeah, I just--

537
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:07,107
I had this really intense dream
about you last night.

538
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:08,677
Don't ask.

539
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:10,645
Of course. That's private.

540
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:12,179
Do you ever have those?

541
00:30:12,313 --> 00:30:15,282
Uh. intense dreams?
Um...

542
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:17,318
Actually, uh, yeah.

543
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:19,353
Tell me.

544
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:22,256
You know Harley Quinn
from <i>Suicide Squad?</i>

545
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:23,223
Okay.

546
00:30:23,357 --> 00:30:24,693
I had this one dream

547
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:27,995
where I wouldn't let her
adopt a dog.

548
00:30:28,128 --> 00:30:31,265
So she'd locked me
in one of the dog cages

549
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:33,167
and dragged me back
to her hideout.

550
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,303
I kicked at the cage
and screamed.

551
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:37,605
And that made you come?

552
00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:40,207
Uhh... I did not.

553
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:42,476
How is that a sex dream?

554
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,512
You asked me if I have
intense dreams.

555
00:30:46,113 --> 00:30:48,382
You're right.
I should've been more specific.

556
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:51,885
I used to have nightmares
about this song

557
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:53,053
when I was a kid.

558
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:54,355
Why?

559
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:58,325
'Cause it's about a monster.
A man-eater.

560
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:00,094
"She only comes out at night.

561
00:31:00,227 --> 00:31:02,697
Watch out, boy.
She'll chew you up."

562
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:06,233
I don't think
that's what the song is about.

563
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:07,802
I'll look into that.

564
00:31:07,935 --> 00:31:10,505
Long Island iced tea
for America's sweetheart,

565
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:11,706
and one for the boy.

566
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,041
Oh, uh, good news,
by the way.

567
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:15,744
Um, we got some new dogs
in today.

568
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:18,212
So, you know,
if you're still looking...

569
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,718
This is the worst iced tea
I've ever had.

570
00:31:23,852 --> 00:31:25,486
Percy,
you're going to college soon.

571
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,421
You're gonna have to learn
how to drink.

572
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:29,691
Can't go your whole life
scared of everything.

573
00:31:29,824 --> 00:31:31,593
I'm not scared of everything.

574
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:33,127
Come on. Open up.

575
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,395
Have your medicine.

576
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:36,230
Come on, baby bird.
I don't like it.

577
00:31:36,363 --> 00:31:37,898
Oh, shit.
Well, well,

578
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:40,100
look at what the tide
dragged in.

579
00:31:41,268 --> 00:31:43,103
Hello, Travis.

580
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:45,540
Well, I don't know
if you heard, but...

581
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:48,777
That's great. Congratulations.

582
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:51,378
Congratulations.
Thank you. Thank you.

583
00:31:51,513 --> 00:31:54,181
Turns out your little
disappearing act,

584
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:56,283
that was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

585
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:58,586
Well,
I'm happy I could help.

586
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,654
You know...

587
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:05,426
my wife,
she speaks three languages.

588
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,896
She's hot as fuck.
The sex is incredible, heh.

589
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:11,465
We do everything together.
All of it.

590
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,802
That's great.
Is her vagina dishwasher-safe?

591
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:14,836
No.

592
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:17,237
She's a real person.

593
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:19,908
Unlike you.

594
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,710
Wanna know
what the best part is?

595
00:32:22,844 --> 00:32:25,112
When I told her
that I loved her,

596
00:32:25,245 --> 00:32:28,850
she said it back to me
instead of running away.

597
00:32:28,982 --> 00:32:30,350
Like a coward.

598
00:32:30,484 --> 00:32:32,654
That must've been
a really exciting second date.

599
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:41,796
You better be careful
of this one.
Mmm.

600
00:32:42,564 --> 00:32:43,865
She is slippery.

601
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:46,467
Bye-bye. Bye, Travis.

602
00:32:48,636 --> 00:32:51,840
Is that your ex-boyfriend?
More like a friend.

603
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:53,974
It felt like
you didn't really like him.

604
00:32:54,107 --> 00:32:57,779
You met him. Do you like him?
I didn't have sex with him.

605
00:32:57,912 --> 00:33:00,113
Do you want to?
I can call him back over.

606
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:02,851
Hey, Travis.
No, no, no. No.

607
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:04,451
I don't wanna do that.
I just...

608
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:06,453
I don't know why
you'd have sex with someone

609
00:33:06,588 --> 00:33:07,922
if you don't like them.

610
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:10,592
It was Christmas, I was lonely.
I don't know.

611
00:33:10,725 --> 00:33:12,359
Why'd you disappear on him?

612
00:33:12,493 --> 00:33:14,896
What's with the questions?
Can't we get drunk and have fun?

613
00:33:15,028 --> 00:33:17,498
Oh, sorry. Just trying
to get to know you.

614
00:33:20,434 --> 00:33:22,971
Do you wanna get out of here?
Yes. Please.

615
00:33:23,103 --> 00:33:25,607
Ah. I think
I'm a little drunk.

616
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,442
Yeah,
you've been drinking a lot.

617
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,476
No, I wasn't.

618
00:33:30,512 --> 00:33:32,212
God, I love the beach.

619
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:34,582
I just feel so free out here.
Don't you?

620
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:35,683
Um...

621
00:33:35,817 --> 00:33:37,251
Yeah.

622
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:41,890
I think it's closed, though.
Oh, it's after 8, so...

623
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:44,826
We could come back
during operating hours.

624
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:46,561
We got the whole place
to ourselves.

625
00:33:46,694 --> 00:33:48,262
Lots of red flags.

626
00:33:48,395 --> 00:33:50,732
Let's go swimming.
There's no lifeguards.

627
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:53,835
Perfect.
We can go skinny-dipping.

628
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:57,672
Oh, look, no swimming.

629
00:33:57,805 --> 00:33:59,641
Oh, we tried.

630
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:03,945
You know, those rules are
more like just suggestions.

631
00:34:04,077 --> 00:34:06,346
Come on, let's get you
out of these Daisy Dukes.

632
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,816
Ha, ha! Maddie, I don't know.

633
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:13,555
I'm ugly to you. I knew it.

634
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:15,023
I knew it.
What?

635
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,525
N-- No.

636
00:34:19,326 --> 00:34:20,929
No.
Seems like it.

637
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:21,963
No, I...

638
00:34:23,698 --> 00:34:25,098
I think you're the...

639
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:27,401
I think you're the prettiest
person I've ever seen.

640
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:29,136
Really?

641
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,371
Pretty where?

642
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:38,012
Pretty here?

643
00:34:41,315 --> 00:34:43,851
Or pretty here?

644
00:34:51,593 --> 00:34:53,226
What about sharks?

645
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,261
None here.

646
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:56,463
Jellyfish?

647
00:34:56,598 --> 00:34:57,765
Not in season.

648
00:34:57,899 --> 00:34:59,266
It's really
the lack of lifeguards

649
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:00,835
that's causing an issue
for me.

650
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:02,402
Just get the fuck in here
right now!

651
00:35:02,537 --> 00:35:04,973
Okay! Okay. Okay.

652
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:07,775
Come on. I promise
nothing's gonna happen.

653
00:35:10,912 --> 00:35:12,547
Isn't this
how <i>Jaws</i> started?

654
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:18,586
I'm going to trust you.

655
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:34,334
See? It's not so bad.

656
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:38,940
Mmm.

657
00:35:40,108 --> 00:35:41,643
Fuck her!

658
00:35:41,776 --> 00:35:43,978
Fuck her
in the butt!

659
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:46,279
What are they doing?
I don't know.

660
00:35:46,413 --> 00:35:47,347
Hello.

661
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:50,350
Hey, what you up to
over there?

662
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:52,954
Just doing our taxes.

663
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:54,454
These yours?

664
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:56,490
Yeah,
no need to fold them.

665
00:35:56,624 --> 00:35:58,492
Let's take her clothes.
Take her clothes.

666
00:35:58,626 --> 00:36:01,129
Take her fucking clothes.
They're taking our clothes.

667
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:04,666
Hey, put that back!
Suck my balls!

668
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:06,501
Oh-ho-ho!

669
00:36:06,634 --> 00:36:07,869
I'm warning you.

670
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:10,337
Bye, sea bitch.

671
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,439
You said nothing bad
would happen.

672
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:15,510
We need to find an adult.
Percy, you're an adult.

673
00:36:15,643 --> 00:36:16,844
Where are you going?

674
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:19,614
Oh, dude.
What the fuck?

675
00:36:19,747 --> 00:36:21,015
Gross, right?
Dude.

676
00:36:21,149 --> 00:36:22,315
It's like nasty.

677
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:25,053
Wait, are you serious?
We lost one.

678
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,587
- Fuck yeah.
- Come here, cunts.

679
00:36:26,721 --> 00:36:29,057
What the fuck?

680
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:33,094
Shit.

681
00:36:33,226 --> 00:36:34,829
Stay the fuck back.
Who wants some?

682
00:36:35,963 --> 00:36:37,230
Fucking...

683
00:36:38,298 --> 00:36:39,466
Come on.

684
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,135
Aah! Aah!

685
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:52,212
Come here.
Come on. Come on.

686
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:54,448
Oh, my God.

687
00:36:54,582 --> 00:36:56,050
- Connor.
- What the fuck?

688
00:36:57,417 --> 00:36:58,886
What about you?
You want the business?

689
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,188
Take it. Take it.

690
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,622
Think it's cool
to steal clothes?

691
00:37:01,756 --> 00:37:02,724
You need fucking help.

692
00:37:02,857 --> 00:37:04,025
I'm calling the cops.

693
00:37:04,158 --> 00:37:06,393
And stay the fuck out
of Montauk!

694
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:08,295
Ah...

695
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:10,865
Where were we?

696
00:37:10,998 --> 00:37:15,069
What happened over there?
I got our clothes back.

697
00:37:15,203 --> 00:37:17,939
Did you beat up those kids?
No.

698
00:37:18,072 --> 00:37:20,575
They apologized.
I heard screaming.

699
00:37:21,843 --> 00:37:23,410
That was the apologizing.

700
00:37:27,515 --> 00:37:31,251
I don't like this. Something's
really wrong with you.

701
00:37:31,384 --> 00:37:35,223
They had our clothes, our
phones, our keys, our wallets.

702
00:37:35,388 --> 00:37:38,059
I got them back. What would you
have done? Nothing?

703
00:37:38,192 --> 00:37:40,762
You should be thanking me.
I was coming up with a plan.

704
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:42,964
To do what?
Call your mom and dad?

705
00:37:43,097 --> 00:37:44,031
Sack up, ho.

706
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:48,202
Sorry. That was mean.
Let's fuck.

707
00:37:49,904 --> 00:37:50,905
No?

708
00:37:53,241 --> 00:37:54,642
Why not?

709
00:37:54,776 --> 00:37:57,444
Because it's like
you're trying to eat me.

710
00:37:57,578 --> 00:37:58,478
Oh, God.

711
00:37:58,613 --> 00:37:59,747
I'm not gonna have sex

712
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:01,481
with somebody
that I don't know.

713
00:38:01,616 --> 00:38:04,085
It's better that way.
Trust me.

714
00:38:04,218 --> 00:38:05,953
Not for me.

715
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:10,490
This is bullshit. I'm done.
I feel sorry for you.

716
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,301
Fucking waste of time.

717
00:38:21,434 --> 00:38:23,070
Hey! Hey!

718
00:38:25,573 --> 00:38:28,509
Hey, give me my clothes.
Okay.

719
00:38:28,643 --> 00:38:30,945
Here,
take your little booty shorts.

720
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:36,349
Where's my phone?
Is it in your car?

721
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:37,952
Nope.
You barely even looked.

722
00:38:38,085 --> 00:38:39,654
It's not in here.

723
00:38:39,787 --> 00:38:41,889
Can you check? My parents
need to know where I am.

724
00:38:42,023 --> 00:38:43,591
Why? Are you a child?

725
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:50,965
Aah!
Give me my phone!

726
00:38:51,098 --> 00:38:53,835
Percy, get off my hood.
Not until you give me my phone.

727
00:38:53,968 --> 00:38:56,436
I need it.
Okay, guess we're doing this.

728
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:01,709
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, very funny, Maddie.

729
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:03,544
Yo!
PERCY Now let me off.

730
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:07,081
Just give me my phone.
I just need my phone.

731
00:39:07,215 --> 00:39:10,852
I will drive to fucking Chicago.
Just give me my phone.

732
00:39:12,485 --> 00:39:15,488
Don't test me.
'Cause I'm fucking crazy.

733
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:17,124
I'm stupid. I'm dumb.

734
00:39:17,258 --> 00:39:18,159
I don't give a--

735
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:19,560
Fuck me.

736
00:39:19,694 --> 00:39:21,195
- Oh, thank God.
- Fuck.

737
00:39:22,495 --> 00:39:24,065
Idiot.
Oh, thank God.

738
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:28,135
Okay, pull over.
Just pull over. Just stop.

739
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:30,872
I'm on probation.
I can't lose my license.

740
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:32,173
<i>Pull over.</i>

741
00:39:33,674 --> 00:39:34,775
What the fuck are you doing?

742
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:36,577
Hang on.

743
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:38,613
Sorry. Hold on.

744
00:39:38,746 --> 00:39:42,049
Oh, my God!

745
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:48,222
God.

746
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,569
I'm not seeing any cops
out there. I think we lost them.

747
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:03,571
Are you sure? Keep looking.

748
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:07,708
I can't believe you drove
over the train tracks.

749
00:40:07,842 --> 00:40:09,476
I thought
we were gonna die.

750
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,979
You were really brave, holding
on to the hood like that.

751
00:40:12,113 --> 00:40:13,915
Most guys
would've fallen off.

752
00:40:14,048 --> 00:40:17,084
I have pretty strong hands
from piano lessons.

753
00:40:17,218 --> 00:40:19,120
Ooh,
we should have some music.

754
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:20,621
Yeah, yeah.

755
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:22,890
Hey, thank you for
these clothes, by the way.

756
00:40:24,325 --> 00:40:26,394
I like your house a lot.
It's cozy.

757
00:40:26,527 --> 00:40:28,596
Bedroom's the best part.
I'll show you later.

758
00:40:38,606 --> 00:40:40,107
Oh, we're wearing
the same shorts.

759
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:41,742
Ssh.

760
00:40:47,348 --> 00:40:48,783
Did you
grow up dancing?

761
00:40:51,585 --> 00:40:53,287
Smack it.
You want...?

762
00:40:53,421 --> 00:40:55,289
Me smack it? You want me
to smack it?
Mm-hm.

763
00:40:58,059 --> 00:40:59,627
Do I have your consent...?
Yeah.

764
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,629
Smack it. Harder.

765
00:41:03,097 --> 00:41:03,998
Hit it.

766
00:41:04,899 --> 00:41:06,701
Sorry.

767
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:11,672
So how long have you lived here?

768
00:41:21,983 --> 00:41:24,185
Ow. Ow. Ow.

769
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:26,921
You're a little heavy
on my legs.

770
00:41:27,054 --> 00:41:28,656
You wanna switch?

771
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:40,801
Do you wanna
go to the bedroom?

772
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:41,836
We can take it slow.

773
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,238
Yeah.

774
00:41:44,372 --> 00:41:46,507
Thank you.
Are you okay?

775
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,075
Yeah, I wanna-- I wanna--

776
00:41:48,209 --> 00:41:51,145
Yeah, I'm just a little itchy.
But let's go.

777
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:53,647
Sorry.
Heh-heh.

778
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:55,649
Does it look weird?

779
00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:58,853
No, it's fine.
My back itches too.

780
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:03,324
Oh, my God.
What?

781
00:42:05,726 --> 00:42:06,994
Oh, God.

782
00:42:09,296 --> 00:42:11,232
This happens sometimes
when I get anxious.

783
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:13,401
I know you're really horny.
I'm sorry.

784
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:15,436
Fuck.

785
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:17,671
This is for board rash,

786
00:42:17,805 --> 00:42:19,440
but it should do the trick.

787
00:42:20,775 --> 00:42:22,076
I'm so embarrassed.

788
00:42:23,144 --> 00:42:24,178
Don't be.

789
00:42:25,946 --> 00:42:28,649
I once went to a Halloween party
dressed as a baby.

790
00:42:28,783 --> 00:42:31,552
My crush was there,
and as we were hooking up,

791
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:35,256
we both realized that I got
diaper rash from my costume.

792
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:36,690
I was 21.

793
00:42:36,824 --> 00:42:38,926
You didn't wear underwear?

794
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,694
Diapers are underwear.

795
00:42:40,828 --> 00:42:43,532
No, they're not. Diapers are
like wearable toilets.

796
00:42:43,664 --> 00:42:45,599
Well, I didn't use it.

797
00:42:45,733 --> 00:42:46,634
Sure, you didn't.

798
00:42:48,503 --> 00:42:50,539
There's a smile.
Hmm.

799
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:55,276
I don't really have
a lot to smile about.

800
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:57,044
I can barely leave my room.

801
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:01,516
Well, I've lived in this house
my whole life.

802
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:02,750
Really?

803
00:43:02,883 --> 00:43:05,753
I did leave once,
when I was 18.

804
00:43:05,886 --> 00:43:07,788
I had this custom board

805
00:43:07,922 --> 00:43:10,291
of all the California beaches
I was gonna surf.

806
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:12,760
Made it all the way
to New York City

807
00:43:12,893 --> 00:43:14,962
before
I turned back around.

808
00:43:15,096 --> 00:43:17,665
Why'd you turn around?
I just realized

809
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:20,167
everything I need is here.

810
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:22,136
And my mom got sick.
So...

811
00:43:24,238 --> 00:43:25,873
I stayed
to take care of her.

812
00:43:27,775 --> 00:43:29,143
Why couldn't your dad do it?

813
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:32,079
Lift up your arms.

814
00:43:35,082 --> 00:43:37,618
I had to switch schools...

815
00:43:37,751 --> 00:43:39,521
after I had a sleepover
in ninth grade

816
00:43:39,653 --> 00:43:41,288
and everybody found out
that I still slept

817
00:43:41,422 --> 00:43:43,791
in my parents' room
sometimes, so...

818
00:43:46,427 --> 00:43:47,862
It turned into this rumor

819
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:50,698
that I slept
in the same bed with them...

820
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:54,735
and then it became
that I had sex with them.

821
00:43:57,938 --> 00:43:59,440
It was awful.

822
00:43:59,574 --> 00:44:02,243
Probably why
I spend so much time alone.

823
00:44:02,376 --> 00:44:03,744
You don't have any friends?

824
00:44:03,878 --> 00:44:07,248
Yeah, I have tons of friends,
just online.

825
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:12,820
Having Jody in my life
helped a lot too.

826
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:15,823
Who?

827
00:44:15,956 --> 00:44:17,858
Jody's my old nanny.
Turn around.

828
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:31,105
I'm sorry I couldn't
have sex with you today.

829
00:44:32,773 --> 00:44:35,776
I-I guess I'm just
a bit of a romantic.

830
00:44:36,645 --> 00:44:37,546
It's okay.

831
00:44:39,113 --> 00:44:41,849
Maybe we could spend the day
together tomorrow?

832
00:44:41,982 --> 00:44:43,684
Then, I promise,
I'll put out.

833
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,589
Sounds nice.

834
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:01,670
It's just, like, swish.

835
00:45:02,703 --> 00:45:03,737
What's that?

836
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:33,167
Frisbee thing...
Yeah.

837
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,201
...and then the smallest...

838
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:39,608
Yeah. Got it, got it.

839
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,609
Bye!

840
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:41,775
Get a life.

841
00:45:48,215 --> 00:45:49,083
There.

842
00:45:49,216 --> 00:45:51,285
Ah.

843
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:53,287
You can finally drink
while you're at bat.

844
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,990
You get me. What else?

845
00:45:56,123 --> 00:45:56,957
Oh! Uh...

846
00:45:57,091 --> 00:45:57,992
Close your eyes.

847
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:01,762
And stick out your finger.

848
00:46:05,232 --> 00:46:06,767
Now you're stuck with me
forever.

849
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:09,770
It's a finger trap.

850
00:46:10,904 --> 00:46:11,872
Percy,
get me out of this.

851
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:12,906
Stop pulling away.

852
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,643
Stop pulling away. Relax.

853
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:15,677
Just push in.

854
00:46:17,646 --> 00:46:18,580
Mm.

855
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,822
Do you think we would've been
friends in high school?

856
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:30,659
Yeah, I think so.

857
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:33,427
I don't know.
I feel like you were, like...

858
00:46:33,561 --> 00:46:35,796
prom queen or something.

859
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:38,098
I didn't even go to prom.

860
00:46:38,232 --> 00:46:39,900
What? Nobody asked you?

861
00:46:40,034 --> 00:46:43,103
Everybody asked me.
Teachers asked me.

862
00:46:43,237 --> 00:46:45,774
I had a date,
and a dress, and...

863
00:46:45,906 --> 00:46:47,141
What happened?

864
00:46:47,274 --> 00:46:49,176
It was a long time ago.
Who cares?

865
00:46:50,578 --> 00:46:51,680
I care.

866
00:46:54,148 --> 00:46:57,284
Well, you asked why my dad
didn't take care of my mom

867
00:46:57,418 --> 00:46:59,186
when she was sick.

868
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,022
It's 'cause he was in the city
with his family.

869
00:47:03,157 --> 00:47:04,191
They summer here.

870
00:47:04,793 --> 00:47:06,026
Oh.

871
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,361
They had an affair.

872
00:47:09,963 --> 00:47:12,132
And then I came along.

873
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:15,135
I was just a mess
that he didn't wanna deal with.

874
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:18,172
So he had his lawyers
clean everything up,

875
00:47:18,305 --> 00:47:21,676
gave my mom some money
and a house to make us go away.

876
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:26,480
Years later,
I wrote my dad a letter

877
00:47:26,614 --> 00:47:29,917
asking why he wanted nothing
to do with me.

878
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:32,886
But, um,
on the morning of prom...

879
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,056
I got the letter returned,
unopened.

880
00:47:38,827 --> 00:47:41,495
And so after that,
I didn't wanna go to prom.

881
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:43,665
I didn't wanna--
I didn't wanna do anything.

882
00:47:43,798 --> 00:47:46,333
I just stayed in my room
and cried.

883
00:47:47,736 --> 00:47:49,671
Why didn't you
reach back out to him?

884
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:54,041
'Cause fuck him. He left.
He can reach out.

885
00:47:58,345 --> 00:47:59,246
What?

886
00:48:00,815 --> 00:48:02,082
Can I kiss you?

887
00:48:23,404 --> 00:48:24,304
It's Jody.

888
00:48:25,372 --> 00:48:26,808
Who?

889
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,076
J-Jody. Uh, my nanny.
Remember?

890
00:48:29,209 --> 00:48:31,646
Meet at the lighthouse.
Yeah.

891
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,714
Okay.

892
00:48:34,014 --> 00:48:35,048
You sure
you don't wanna

893
00:48:35,182 --> 00:48:36,183
just go back to my house?

894
00:48:36,316 --> 00:48:37,451
I'm still horny from
that kiss.

895
00:48:37,585 --> 00:48:39,386
Yes, Jody!

896
00:48:39,521 --> 00:48:40,789
- Hi.
- There he is.

897
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:42,089
The tickle prince.

898
00:48:44,726 --> 00:48:46,728
So this must be
the famous Maddie.

899
00:48:46,861 --> 00:48:49,363
And you're Jody.
You were Percy's nanny?

900
00:48:49,496 --> 00:48:50,765
Mr. Mary Poppins.

901
00:48:50,899 --> 00:48:52,600
Oh.

902
00:48:52,734 --> 00:48:55,469
You guys stayed
pretty close, huh?

903
00:48:55,603 --> 00:48:57,171
Oh, yeah. Super close.

904
00:48:58,439 --> 00:49:00,274
What'd you win there, pal?
Oh.

905
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:02,409
Is that a Frisbee?
Oh, yeah, Maddie won it.

906
00:49:02,544 --> 00:49:03,745
Nice.
Look at that.

907
00:49:03,878 --> 00:49:05,814
Maddie, score!
Yeah.

908
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:07,715
Hey, Perce, go long.
Oh.

909
00:49:09,717 --> 00:49:11,886
Oh. Oh.

910
00:49:12,019 --> 00:49:13,555
I-I got it.
Heh, heh!

911
00:49:13,688 --> 00:49:15,389
Real motor on that little guy.

912
00:49:15,523 --> 00:49:16,758
What the fuck do you want?

913
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:19,293
Excuse me?

914
00:49:19,426 --> 00:49:21,796
It's his parents' money,
not his.

915
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,698
You like little kids
or something?

916
00:49:23,832 --> 00:49:25,834
Do I like little kids?
You're a male nanny.

917
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:27,502
What do you want from him?

918
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:29,369
Same thing as you.
I wanna date him.

919
00:49:32,005 --> 00:49:34,843
I have nannied for a lot
of powerful families out here.

920
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,244
So if you hurt him...

921
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:38,780
I'll hurt you.

922
00:49:38,913 --> 00:49:41,348
What are you gonna do?
Throw a pacifier at me?

923
00:49:41,482 --> 00:49:43,918
Hey, bud.
Hey.

924
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:45,854
It was in a prickle bush,
but I got it.

925
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:47,120
That's incredible.

926
00:49:49,657 --> 00:49:52,125
Okay, are you ready
for your gift?

927
00:49:52,259 --> 00:49:54,394
Yeah.
I'm bringing it out.

928
00:49:57,364 --> 00:50:00,535
Oh, my God...

929
00:50:00,668 --> 00:50:01,970
Did you find this?

930
00:50:02,102 --> 00:50:03,872
Figured it would get him
into surfing early.

931
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:05,205
Wow, this is...

932
00:50:06,273 --> 00:50:07,709
It turns on.
It does?

933
00:50:07,842 --> 00:50:09,811
Why don't-- Why don't we see
if that makes it better?

934
00:50:09,944 --> 00:50:12,145
Yeah,
I have batteries somewhere.

935
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:13,313
Nice.

936
00:50:15,817 --> 00:50:16,818
No.

937
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,688
Hey, how's the Buick thing
working out?

938
00:50:20,822 --> 00:50:22,991
- I haven't gotten it.
- Really?

939
00:50:24,792 --> 00:50:26,059
Huh.

940
00:50:26,193 --> 00:50:27,094
Why?

941
00:50:29,664 --> 00:50:32,567
I mean, they haven't given it
to you yet?

942
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,434
You could sue them
for that, you know.

943
00:50:34,569 --> 00:50:37,371
Actually,
we haven't had sex yet.

944
00:50:37,505 --> 00:50:39,741
He just needs more
of a connection first.

945
00:50:39,874 --> 00:50:42,309
I actually really like him.
We're becoming friends.

946
00:50:44,546 --> 00:50:45,580
Mmm.

947
00:50:45,713 --> 00:50:47,047
He's gonna forget about me.

948
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,315
He's going to college
in the fall.

949
00:50:48,448 --> 00:50:49,349
I don't know.

950
00:50:49,483 --> 00:50:50,685
Well, it's happening tonight.

951
00:50:50,818 --> 00:50:52,052
We're getting dinner.

952
00:50:52,185 --> 00:50:53,655
You're going to dinner.

953
00:50:53,788 --> 00:50:56,089
Okay, so you're, like,
"dating" dating, then.

954
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:57,124
Shut up.

955
00:51:00,662 --> 00:51:01,963
I know what I'm doing.

956
00:51:09,436 --> 00:51:10,437
Maddie.

957
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:13,875
It's me, Doug Khan.

958
00:51:14,008 --> 00:51:17,210
We went to high school
together. Remember? I...

959
00:51:17,344 --> 00:51:19,212
I ran varsity track?

960
00:51:19,346 --> 00:51:21,348
I had that sweet
cherry-red Miata?

961
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,620
I had sex with our
Spanish teacher, Mrs. Walsh.

962
00:51:25,753 --> 00:51:29,423
Doug Khan! You were on TV.

963
00:51:29,557 --> 00:51:30,959
Didn't Miss Walsh go to jail?

964
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:32,627
Uh, no.

965
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,062
Mrs. Khan did.

966
00:51:35,195 --> 00:51:36,598
We got married.

967
00:51:36,731 --> 00:51:37,732
But, you know...

968
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:40,334
they never run that story.

969
00:51:40,467 --> 00:51:41,970
How can I help you, Doug?

970
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:45,039
Well,
I'm a real estate broker now.

971
00:51:45,172 --> 00:51:48,241
I don't have to tell you,
this is a fabulous neighborhood.

972
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:50,210
I mean,
an acre on this street?

973
00:51:50,344 --> 00:51:52,412
Name your price, Maddie.

974
00:51:52,547 --> 00:51:54,816
It was great catching up, Doug.
Listen, come on.

975
00:51:54,949 --> 00:51:56,551
If you don't
pay off your lien,

976
00:51:56,684 --> 00:51:58,452
the county's gonna
fire-sale your house.

977
00:51:58,586 --> 00:52:00,021
You'll lose half
of what it's worth.

978
00:52:00,153 --> 00:52:01,689
Let me list it,
you'll get full price.

979
00:52:01,823 --> 00:52:03,825
So they can tear
this whole thing down?

980
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:06,259
Stay off my yard, Doug.

981
00:52:43,031 --> 00:52:44,364
Was this a stupid idea?

982
00:52:44,498 --> 00:52:47,200
No, I love it.
We're finally going to prom.

983
00:52:48,503 --> 00:52:49,771
I have something for you.

984
00:52:55,943 --> 00:52:57,845
I have this.

985
00:52:57,979 --> 00:52:59,981
It's from my garden.

986
00:53:00,114 --> 00:53:01,082
Careful.

987
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:09,557
You look very handsome.
Should we take a picture?

988
00:53:11,659 --> 00:53:14,361
I-- I left my phone at home.
On purpose.

989
00:53:14,494 --> 00:53:15,897
What?
Yeah.

990
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,899
I don't believe you.
No, I did.

991
00:53:18,032 --> 00:53:19,967
I don't believe you.
No! I don't have it.

992
00:53:20,101 --> 00:53:22,670
I did. I did.
I just wanna talk to you.

993
00:53:35,248 --> 00:53:36,349
Just crack it.

994
00:53:36,483 --> 00:53:38,119
The claws
are still sharp!

995
00:53:40,054 --> 00:53:43,791
This is so much better than if
I actually went to my prom, heh.

996
00:53:43,925 --> 00:53:44,859
Why didn't you?

997
00:53:46,293 --> 00:53:48,162
I just didn't ask anybody.

998
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:49,362
Why?

999
00:53:49,496 --> 00:53:51,032
I don't know. I guess, um...

1000
00:53:52,867 --> 00:53:54,502
After everything
that happened at school,

1001
00:53:54,635 --> 00:53:56,403
I just wanted
to stay invisible.

1002
00:53:59,073 --> 00:54:01,609
If they couldn't see me,
they couldn't make fun of me.

1003
00:54:01,743 --> 00:54:04,612
People should see who you are.
You're great.

1004
00:54:06,346 --> 00:54:07,247
Thanks.

1005
00:54:15,523 --> 00:54:17,457
What?
Play something.

1006
00:54:17,592 --> 00:54:18,793
No.

1007
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:21,294
You said you play.
You should play something.

1008
00:54:21,428 --> 00:54:23,363
I'm not going to play.

1009
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:25,133
If you don't play something,

1010
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:27,201
I'm gonna make a toast
to the entire restaurant

1011
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:28,770
about what an amazing lover
you are.

1012
00:54:30,238 --> 00:54:32,439
Good.
It's time they find out.

1013
00:54:34,075 --> 00:54:35,643
Stop, stop, stop.

1014
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:41,281
Wha--?
What do you want me to play?

1015
00:54:41,414 --> 00:54:43,918
Doesn't matter. Play anything.
Play it for me.

1016
00:54:45,653 --> 00:54:47,155
Fuck.

1017
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:48,756
Fuck.

1018
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,258
Fuck me. Fuck.

1019
00:54:52,193 --> 00:54:53,393
Okay. Okay.

1020
00:54:55,196 --> 00:54:56,063
Fuck.

1021
00:57:58,112 --> 00:57:59,180
Yes!

1022
00:58:05,786 --> 00:58:06,754
What the fuck?

1023
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,790
That was unbelievable.

1024
00:58:09,924 --> 00:58:11,993
How did you even know
that song?

1025
00:58:12,126 --> 00:58:16,063
We talked about "Maneater,"
so I went home and learned it.

1026
00:58:16,197 --> 00:58:17,832
What are you?

1027
00:58:17,965 --> 00:58:19,166
Percy.

1028
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,701
Natalie. Oh, my God.
Hi.

1029
00:58:20,835 --> 00:58:22,670
That's so funny.
That was amazing.

1030
00:58:22,803 --> 00:58:25,573
Oh, my God. Dude,
I haven't seen you in so long.

1031
00:58:25,706 --> 00:58:27,708
My parents said that
you're going to Princeton.

1032
00:58:27,842 --> 00:58:29,677
- Yeah.
- I am too.

1033
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:32,146
Oh, my God, that's so great!
How funny is that? I know!

1034
00:58:32,279 --> 00:58:33,881
That's amazing.

1035
00:58:34,015 --> 00:58:35,549
Oh.
Maddie, this is Maddie.

1036
00:58:35,683 --> 00:58:36,951
Maddie.
So nice to meet you.

1037
00:58:37,084 --> 00:58:38,819
Are you friends
with his parents too?

1038
00:58:38,953 --> 00:58:40,121
No.

1039
00:58:40,254 --> 00:58:41,922
Um.
So are you excited?

1040
00:58:42,056 --> 00:58:43,491
Yes! So excited.

1041
00:58:43,624 --> 00:58:45,426
Except it's wild,
I look at all, like,

1042
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:47,528
the freshman girls
at my high school...

1043
00:58:49,063 --> 00:58:53,768
and I don't know. I just
feel so old. You know?

1044
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:56,437
Yeah.
Yeah. So good to see you.

1045
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:57,905
I don't know
what you're doing later,

1046
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:00,174
but there's this party
that I'm going to.

1047
00:59:00,307 --> 00:59:02,209
There's gonna be a bunch
of Princeton people there.

1048
00:59:02,343 --> 00:59:05,346
We have plans,
but thank you so much.

1049
00:59:05,479 --> 00:59:07,748
Oh, dang. Um,
I can send you the address.

1050
00:59:07,882 --> 00:59:09,850
He didn't bring his phone.
So...

1051
00:59:09,984 --> 00:59:11,819
Oh, I can give you the address.
No need.

1052
00:59:11,952 --> 00:59:13,054
Can't hurt.
Might hurt.

1053
00:59:14,088 --> 00:59:15,056
Um...

1054
00:59:15,189 --> 00:59:16,924
31 Amagansett Road.

1055
00:59:17,058 --> 00:59:19,360
It was so nice to meet you.

1056
00:59:19,493 --> 00:59:23,297
Um. Oh, my God. Next year is
gonna be so fun. I can't wait.

1057
00:59:23,431 --> 00:59:25,866
That's so exciting. Yeah.
Okay. So nice to run into you.

1058
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,702
So nice to meet you, ma'am.
Bye. Have a good night.

1059
00:59:28,836 --> 00:59:29,737
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Bye.

1060
00:59:31,138 --> 00:59:32,740
So funny.

1061
00:59:32,873 --> 00:59:36,243
Don't remember ordering
a phony bitch for dessert.

1062
00:59:36,377 --> 00:59:37,945
Natalie's, like, super nice.

1063
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:39,947
Well, anyway. I can't believe
you can do that,

1064
00:59:40,081 --> 00:59:40,948
but you can't drive.

1065
00:59:41,082 --> 00:59:43,050
Yeah, actually, um,

1066
00:59:43,184 --> 00:59:44,985
so I've been thinking about
getting my license.

1067
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,221
That's great.
Yeah? Good.

1068
00:59:47,354 --> 00:59:51,926
You know, 'cause Princeton's
like five hours away by train,

1069
00:59:52,059 --> 00:59:53,562
but if I have a car,
then I can--

1070
00:59:53,694 --> 00:59:54,762
It'll be a lot easier for me

1071
00:59:54,895 --> 00:59:56,464
to come back here on
the weekends.

1072
00:59:58,533 --> 01:00:00,634
Well, you're gonna--

1073
01:00:00,768 --> 01:00:04,105
You're gonna wanna spend
the weekends in school.

1074
01:00:04,238 --> 01:00:05,873
Yeah,
you're probably right.

1075
01:00:07,741 --> 01:00:09,110
You can always come visit me.

1076
01:00:10,211 --> 01:00:11,912
Well, I don't have a car.

1077
01:00:12,046 --> 01:00:14,748
Oh, you could take the train.
It's only five hours.

1078
01:00:14,882 --> 01:00:15,783
Yeah.

1079
01:00:17,985 --> 01:00:21,288
I just don't really--
I don't do long distance.

1080
01:00:21,422 --> 01:00:24,859
You know, I hear Montauk is
the best in the fall.

1081
01:00:24,992 --> 01:00:27,094
All the summer people
are gone. So...

1082
01:00:31,065 --> 01:00:32,066
It's a lot of travel.

1083
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:37,104
I don't know what you want.

1084
01:00:40,441 --> 01:00:41,675
Just wanna have fun tonight

1085
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:43,777
and not talk
about all this stuff.

1086
01:00:48,115 --> 01:00:49,618
I'd like to leave, please.

1087
01:00:51,285 --> 01:00:52,853
Are you serious?

1088
01:00:52,987 --> 01:00:53,888
Yes.

1089
01:00:55,422 --> 01:00:56,558
It's my prom too.

1090
01:00:59,193 --> 01:01:00,127
Fuck.

1091
01:01:11,739 --> 01:01:13,974
I'm just trying to be realistic.
Yeah.

1092
01:01:15,276 --> 01:01:16,177
Me too.

1093
01:01:29,957 --> 01:01:31,759
You're drinking now?

1094
01:01:31,892 --> 01:01:34,161
Yeah. I love vermouth.

1095
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:37,031
I'm going to college soon.

1096
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:39,200
I need to know how to drink,
right?

1097
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:46,140
Where are we going?

1098
01:01:48,543 --> 01:01:49,443
It's a shortcut.

1099
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,589
The Princeton party?

1100
01:02:00,721 --> 01:02:03,558
You said I needed to hang out
with people my own age, right?

1101
01:02:03,692 --> 01:02:05,092
Well, I didn't mean tonight.

1102
01:02:05,226 --> 01:02:06,393
Then don't come.

1103
01:02:10,565 --> 01:02:11,666
Party!

1104
01:02:58,045 --> 01:02:59,446
Do you guys know Percy?

1105
01:03:01,482 --> 01:03:03,183
Do you know Percy?

1106
01:03:03,317 --> 01:03:05,853
Yo, yo, what's going on, you
guys? It's your boy, Cameron B.

1107
01:03:05,986 --> 01:03:07,321
<i>We are kicking the summer</i>
<i>off right</i>

1108
01:03:07,454 --> 01:03:08,989
<i>at a sick house party</i>

1109
01:03:09,123 --> 01:03:10,791
in Montauk.
Now me. Yo, what's up?

1110
01:03:10,924 --> 01:03:12,459
<i>It's me, Trash Gucci.</i>

1111
01:03:12,594 --> 01:03:15,129
If you or someone you know
is being bullied,

1112
01:03:15,262 --> 01:03:16,830
<i>never be afraid to speak up.</i>

1113
01:03:16,964 --> 01:03:18,667
<i>Bullying is not a--</i>
Excuse me, ma'am.

1114
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:21,068
Can you not do that while
we're recording? Thank you.

1115
01:03:21,201 --> 01:03:23,137
Just getting a beer, Frosted.

1116
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:24,706
Did she just call me
Frosted?

1117
01:03:24,838 --> 01:03:26,641
That, my friends, is what
we call a bully, huh?

1118
01:03:26,775 --> 01:03:29,778
<i>Oh, no, not a phone.</i>
<i>Someone help, I'm being filmed.</i>

1119
01:03:32,146 --> 01:03:33,515
Have you seen Percy?

1120
01:03:33,648 --> 01:03:36,950
Oh, yo, <i>mami.</i>
How old are you?

1121
01:03:37,985 --> 01:03:38,952
Twenty-three.

1122
01:03:39,086 --> 01:03:40,588
Damn, you old as fuck.

1123
01:03:40,722 --> 01:03:42,823
No disrespect.
He loves cougars.

1124
01:03:42,956 --> 01:03:44,325
I fuck with the big cats.

1125
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:46,260
Why don't you two big cats
fuck each other, then?

1126
01:03:46,393 --> 01:03:48,028
Whoa!

1127
01:03:48,162 --> 01:03:50,264
Is that an insult?
Shut the front door.

1128
01:03:50,397 --> 01:03:52,099
It sure is, professor.

1129
01:03:52,232 --> 01:03:54,736
Why is us having sex with each
other an insult? I'm confused.

1130
01:03:54,868 --> 01:03:56,236
Say what you just said.
Say that again.

1131
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:57,971
No, I didn't mean it
in a homophobic way.

1132
01:03:58,105 --> 01:03:59,873
How'd you mean it, then?

1133
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:02,343
<i>It was a joke. I'm not--</i>
<i>I've been with girls.</i>

1134
01:04:02,476 --> 01:04:03,745
<i>I'm not--</i>
<i>I'm not homophobic.</i>

1135
01:04:03,877 --> 01:04:05,212
Where the fuck
did you come from?

1136
01:04:05,346 --> 01:04:07,716
Stop filming me. No comment.

1137
01:04:07,848 --> 01:04:10,518
Whose mom is that?

1138
01:04:13,187 --> 01:04:14,789
Have you seen Percy?

1139
01:04:16,957 --> 01:04:17,826
Oh, my God.

1140
01:04:19,493 --> 01:04:20,695
Was that funny?

1141
01:04:20,829 --> 01:04:22,630
He's with Natalie
upstairs.

1142
01:04:24,465 --> 01:04:25,499
Hey!

1143
01:04:32,507 --> 01:04:34,108
Move! Coming through.

1144
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:37,712
Percy?
Yeah?

1145
01:04:37,846 --> 01:04:39,246
Wait, your name's Percy?

1146
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:40,347
Yeah.

1147
01:04:42,517 --> 01:04:44,218
Percy?

1148
01:04:44,351 --> 01:04:46,019
Sorry. Continue.

1149
01:04:46,153 --> 01:04:47,154
Percy?

1150
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:51,191
Doesn't anyone fuck anymore?

1151
01:04:54,729 --> 01:04:56,196
Percy?

1152
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:57,231
Percy?

1153
01:04:58,332 --> 01:04:59,634
Open this door!

1154
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:01,435
Percy!

1155
01:05:01,569 --> 01:05:04,371
Percy, open this door.
This is your last chance.

1156
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:18,620
Did you fuck him?
Oh, my God.

1157
01:05:18,753 --> 01:05:19,953
Did you fuck him?

1158
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:21,723
Calm down. Please,
nothing happened.

1159
01:05:21,856 --> 01:05:24,258
The room is spinning.
You're drunk already?

1160
01:05:24,391 --> 01:05:27,161
No, he took something. I don't
know. I think it was a pill.

1161
01:05:27,294 --> 01:05:31,432
Percy? Did you take something?
Percy, did you take a pill?

1162
01:05:34,869 --> 01:05:35,737
Come...

1163
01:05:40,207 --> 01:05:41,609
Stick your fingers
down your throat.

1164
01:05:41,743 --> 01:05:43,076
Make yourself
throw up.

1165
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:45,145
- I don't wanna.
- Deeper, deeper.

1166
01:05:48,215 --> 01:05:49,751
No.

1167
01:05:49,884 --> 01:05:50,885
Let me do it!

1168
01:05:59,092 --> 01:06:00,127
Do you feel better?

1169
01:06:01,495 --> 01:06:03,598
Not even at all.

1170
01:06:03,731 --> 01:06:07,167
I didn't know you couldn't
drink on Ibuprofen.

1171
01:06:08,603 --> 01:06:09,838
That's what you took?

1172
01:06:11,806 --> 01:06:14,475
Found her.
Okay, who told the joke?

1173
01:06:14,609 --> 01:06:15,976
Your fucking parents are here?

1174
01:06:16,109 --> 01:06:17,745
You think our son
would have a party

1175
01:06:17,879 --> 01:06:19,179
without our consent?

1176
01:06:19,313 --> 01:06:21,281
That's it. Come on.
You don't belong here.

1177
01:06:21,415 --> 01:06:22,584
<i>I</i> don't belong here?

1178
01:06:22,717 --> 01:06:24,451
I've fucking lived here
my whole life!

1179
01:06:24,586 --> 01:06:25,986
You don't belong here.

1180
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:28,957
You don't belong at
a high-school party, miss.

1181
01:06:29,089 --> 01:06:30,959
Oh, well, yeah--
We're leaving.

1182
01:06:31,091 --> 01:06:32,527
Let me get--
Stay away from her.

1183
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:33,661
Stay back. Okay?

1184
01:06:33,795 --> 01:06:36,063
I said, let go of her--
Stay back!

1185
01:06:36,196 --> 01:06:38,700
Get out of here. Come on.
Don't touch me! Percy--

1186
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,871
Oh, shi-- Oh, fuck!
Oh, sh-- Maddie.

1187
01:06:48,977 --> 01:06:50,277
Fuck!

1188
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:51,613
We should go.

1189
01:07:02,389 --> 01:07:05,560
I just want you to know
I-I would never hurt you.

1190
01:07:08,963 --> 01:07:10,063
I know.

1191
01:07:14,702 --> 01:07:15,837
I'm ready for you.

1192
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:18,840
Are you sure?

1193
01:07:18,973 --> 01:07:19,874
Yes.

1194
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:23,410
Okay.

1195
01:07:24,378 --> 01:07:25,312
I...

1196
01:07:34,321 --> 01:07:36,624
I don't know.
Where's the perforation?

1197
01:07:38,826 --> 01:07:39,894
Let me help you.

1198
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:47,467
I love you.

1199
01:07:53,741 --> 01:07:56,109
Percy, you're drunk.

1200
01:07:57,545 --> 01:07:59,246
A little.

1201
01:07:59,379 --> 01:08:03,952
Is that all right?
I mean, I-I still love you.

1202
01:08:04,084 --> 01:08:06,888
I don't think we should do this
when you're drunk.

1203
01:08:07,021 --> 01:08:08,488
Not for your first time.

1204
01:08:09,624 --> 01:08:10,558
Okay.

1205
01:08:13,595 --> 01:08:14,929
I think we should wait.

1206
01:08:16,396 --> 01:08:17,565
If that's what you want.

1207
01:08:19,834 --> 01:08:20,902
That's what I want.

1208
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:34,749
Well, look what the cat
dragged in.

1209
01:08:34,882 --> 01:08:36,784
Fun night?

1210
01:08:36,918 --> 01:08:38,418
Yeah, yeah, really fun, heh.

1211
01:08:38,553 --> 01:08:40,088
That's good.

1212
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:43,457
Hey, I'll drive you to work.
We can chat.

1213
01:08:43,591 --> 01:08:46,293
Actually, would it be all right
if I-- If I drive?

1214
01:08:46,426 --> 01:08:47,996
I'm thinking about
getting my license,

1215
01:08:48,128 --> 01:08:50,497
so, uh, you know,
I could use the practice.

1216
01:08:50,632 --> 01:08:52,466
My son,
the licensed driver?

1217
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,335
Yeah, it'll just...
You know, if I have a car,

1218
01:08:55,469 --> 01:08:57,505
it'll be easier
to see my girlfriend.

1219
01:08:57,639 --> 01:08:59,874
Oh. Your girlfriend?

1220
01:09:01,174 --> 01:09:05,312
Yeah. Her name is Maddie.

1221
01:09:05,445 --> 01:09:08,248
She's on the older side.
But she's really, really fun.

1222
01:09:09,383 --> 01:09:10,685
Fun's important.
Yeah.

1223
01:09:10,818 --> 01:09:12,620
She doesn't really wanna do
long-distance,

1224
01:09:12,754 --> 01:09:14,856
so I'm not gonna go
to Princeton.

1225
01:09:16,624 --> 01:09:17,525
What?

1226
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:22,429
Just, you know, Maddie's here.

1227
01:09:22,563 --> 01:09:23,631
Just makes sense for us.

1228
01:09:23,765 --> 01:09:25,767
You're going to Princeton.

1229
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,769
I'm not.

1230
01:09:27,902 --> 01:09:29,637
I'm 19.
Okay.

1231
01:09:29,771 --> 01:09:31,105
I'm an adult now.

1232
01:09:31,238 --> 01:09:32,540
I can make my own decisions.

1233
01:09:32,674 --> 01:09:34,307
And I'm going to stay here,
okay?

1234
01:09:34,441 --> 01:09:37,210
Um, sweetie, why don't you
go wait in the car?

1235
01:09:37,344 --> 01:09:39,212
And Daddy will be right out.

1236
01:09:43,785 --> 01:09:45,053
What the fuck was that?

1237
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:52,026
Just relax, okay?

1238
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,163
You drive for a living.
Let me take this one.

1239
01:09:57,965 --> 01:09:59,867
She's angling for the Tesla.

1240
01:10:00,001 --> 01:10:01,536
Call her right now.
I'm gonna yell at her.

1241
01:10:01,669 --> 01:10:03,071
You're gonna yell at her?
Yeah.

1242
01:10:03,203 --> 01:10:04,572
You're gonna yell at
the one person

1243
01:10:04,706 --> 01:10:06,206
who can convince him
to go to college?

1244
01:10:06,339 --> 01:10:08,208
You're right. You're right.
I know.

1245
01:10:08,341 --> 01:10:10,477
You think that they...?
That...?

1246
01:10:10,611 --> 01:10:11,979
Call her. Call her now.

1247
01:10:19,352 --> 01:10:20,855
Hi.

1248
01:10:20,988 --> 01:10:22,557
I was gonna call you.

1249
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:24,525
Listen,
I don't think I can do this.

1250
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:27,161
<i>Percy has gotten</i>
<i>way too attached.</i>

1251
01:10:27,294 --> 01:10:28,830
You-You can have the car.

1252
01:10:30,064 --> 01:10:30,998
Really?

1253
01:10:32,166 --> 01:10:33,266
Even though we didn't...?

1254
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,203
You got him out of his shell,

1255
01:10:35,335 --> 01:10:36,938
and that's all we wanted.

1256
01:10:37,071 --> 01:10:40,407
But now he's got this idea that
he wants to stay in Montauk,

1257
01:10:40,541 --> 01:10:43,778
and you need to convince him
that he has to go to college.

1258
01:10:46,514 --> 01:10:47,915
Yeah.

1259
01:10:48,049 --> 01:10:51,052
Great. Great.
I'll sign over the title today.

1260
01:10:54,454 --> 01:10:57,158
<i>So if I can convince him to go</i>
<i>to Princeton, I get the car?</i>

1261
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:59,093
<i>I don't have to have sex</i>
<i>with him anymore?</i>

1262
01:10:59,227 --> 01:11:01,162
Hello? Maddie? Hello?
Maddie?

1263
01:11:01,294 --> 01:11:02,630
<i>Hello?</i>

1264
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:50,443
Can I try some wine?

1265
01:11:52,345 --> 01:11:53,214
Yeah.
Sure.

1266
01:11:53,346 --> 01:11:54,282
I think that's okay.

1267
01:12:03,024 --> 01:12:04,859
Okay. That's-That's good.

1268
01:12:04,992 --> 01:12:06,694
Easy there.
Mm.

1269
01:12:15,837 --> 01:12:17,305
Sweetie, please.

1270
01:12:17,437 --> 01:12:20,340
You wanna savor it. Savor it.
Yeah.

1271
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:35,690
Oh...

1272
01:12:35,823 --> 01:12:37,792
Did I double-book?

1273
01:12:45,633 --> 01:12:47,869
Aren't you guys gonna
ask Maddie about herself?

1274
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:52,405
Oh, Maddie, where are you--?
Where are you from?

1275
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:55,676
Um, here, actually.
I'm from here.

1276
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:58,378
Yeah, in fact, she's never--
You've never left, right?

1277
01:12:58,512 --> 01:13:01,115
It's so beautiful here,
I don't blame you, heh.

1278
01:13:01,249 --> 01:13:02,250
Mm.

1279
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:03,517
This chicken
is delicious.

1280
01:13:03,651 --> 01:13:05,086
Oh, thank you.
Mm.

1281
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:06,754
Mom, you didn't make it.
Inez did.

1282
01:13:06,888 --> 01:13:08,455
Percy.

1283
01:13:08,589 --> 01:13:11,592
Well, the important thing is
that it's delicious.

1284
01:13:11,726 --> 01:13:14,695
I think the important thing
is the truth.

1285
01:13:14,829 --> 01:13:18,032
And I haven't been
entirely truthful with you all.

1286
01:13:18,165 --> 01:13:21,736
I didn't get the dates wrong.

1287
01:13:21,869 --> 01:13:23,337
I just wanted to introduce you
to them,

1288
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:25,773
but I didn't know how
to explain how old you are.

1289
01:13:31,145 --> 01:13:33,114
Well, I'm not that old.

1290
01:13:33,247 --> 01:13:34,882
I actually know someone

1291
01:13:35,016 --> 01:13:37,952
who married our
high school Spanish teacher.

1292
01:13:38,085 --> 01:13:39,687
Forty-year age difference.

1293
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:42,056
Forty years? And that's
how old you are, right?

1294
01:13:42,189 --> 01:13:43,090
No.

1295
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:47,595
You guys aren't gonna
ask us how we met?

1296
01:13:49,563 --> 01:13:51,165
Oh. How'd you meet?

1297
01:13:51,299 --> 01:13:54,168
Do you wanna tell them? No,
I'll tell them. This is so us.

1298
01:13:54,302 --> 01:13:57,104
It's actually really random.
Maddie came in to adopt a dog.

1299
01:13:57,238 --> 01:13:58,471
Oh!

1300
01:13:58,606 --> 01:14:00,241
Yeah, but I rejected
her application

1301
01:14:00,374 --> 01:14:02,310
because she was
totally unqualified.

1302
01:14:02,442 --> 01:14:03,811
But we still hit it off.

1303
01:14:03,945 --> 01:14:05,813
I mean, the first day we met,
I had to Mace her,

1304
01:14:05,947 --> 01:14:06,981
she was so fucking horny.

1305
01:14:07,114 --> 01:14:08,783
Percy. Percy, be a gentleman.

1306
01:14:08,916 --> 01:14:11,185
I'm kidding,
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1307
01:14:11,319 --> 01:14:12,820
We actually
have a lot in common.

1308
01:14:12,954 --> 01:14:14,655
In four years,
we'll both be seniors.

1309
01:14:14,789 --> 01:14:16,624
Oh.

1310
01:14:16,757 --> 01:14:18,559
Oh, I'm so--
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

1311
01:14:18,693 --> 01:14:20,995
I have to get this, but keep
getting to know each other,

1312
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:22,430
you know, chat.

1313
01:14:22,563 --> 01:14:23,597
My favorite people.

1314
01:14:27,635 --> 01:14:29,136
Did you tell him?
No.

1315
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:34,675
I brought tools.

1316
01:14:34,809 --> 01:14:36,911
We need to move fast.
We're in the middle of dinner.

1317
01:14:37,044 --> 01:14:40,314
What are you having?
Roasted chicken and salad.

1318
01:14:40,448 --> 01:14:42,249
I fucking love salad.

1319
01:14:50,925 --> 01:14:52,560
She's gonna hate
not having hubcaps.

1320
01:14:58,532 --> 01:14:59,734
It's very simple.

1321
01:14:59,867 --> 01:15:01,702
She broke your heart,
you break the car,

1322
01:15:01,836 --> 01:15:04,205
since that's
all she cares about.

1323
01:15:04,338 --> 01:15:06,674
She was just like
every other thing in my life:

1324
01:15:06,807 --> 01:15:09,176
Planned by my parents.

1325
01:15:17,618 --> 01:15:20,521
Fuck!
It's not doing anything.

1326
01:15:20,654 --> 01:15:22,123
Goddamn American-built.

1327
01:15:31,032 --> 01:15:33,834
Ha, Ha! Yeah. Yeah! Okay.
Whoo! Yeah.

1328
01:15:41,642 --> 01:15:42,643
That'll teach her.

1329
01:15:47,348 --> 01:15:48,916
Oh, God.
Hey, there he is.

1330
01:15:50,484 --> 01:15:51,619
Everything all right?

1331
01:16:04,598 --> 01:16:05,534
Hey.

1332
01:16:07,668 --> 01:16:08,569
How we doing?

1333
01:16:10,505 --> 01:16:11,540
Where were you?

1334
01:16:15,342 --> 01:16:16,577
You okay? I--

1335
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:19,313
Percy,
your parents are downstairs.

1336
01:16:19,447 --> 01:16:21,582
I really don't think
they mind.

1337
01:16:21,715 --> 01:16:26,353
Well, can we just talk? God!
Stop. What's--? My wrist.

1338
01:16:30,559 --> 01:16:31,692
What's going on?

1339
01:16:37,064 --> 01:16:38,632
I'm just a little confused.

1340
01:16:38,766 --> 01:16:40,067
Because I--

1341
01:16:40,201 --> 01:16:42,603
Because I thought you wanted
to have sex with me.

1342
01:16:42,736 --> 01:16:44,138
So...

1343
01:16:44,271 --> 01:16:48,042
If there's something
I don't know, just tell me.

1344
01:16:51,011 --> 01:16:52,046
No.

1345
01:16:52,179 --> 01:16:53,414
No?

1346
01:16:53,548 --> 01:16:54,583
No.

1347
01:16:56,283 --> 01:16:57,651
I want to. Let's do it.

1348
01:17:00,721 --> 01:17:02,490
Let's have sex.

1349
01:17:02,623 --> 01:17:04,959
This is what you want?
This will make you happy?

1350
01:17:05,092 --> 01:17:07,361
Yeah. Yep.

1351
01:17:07,495 --> 01:17:08,963
Great.

1352
01:17:31,385 --> 01:17:32,920
Um...

1353
01:17:33,053 --> 01:17:34,655
What--? What do I--?
What do I do?

1354
01:17:34,788 --> 01:17:35,689
Get on top.

1355
01:17:41,262 --> 01:17:44,098
Okay. Yes.
Okay. And now...

1356
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:47,602
Okay, I'll help you.

1357
01:17:47,735 --> 01:17:50,104
Percy, you're not...

1358
01:17:50,237 --> 01:17:53,040
And then I'll help you--
Oh, fuck!

1359
01:17:59,046 --> 01:18:00,147
Mm.

1360
01:18:04,151 --> 01:18:05,886
Did you come too?

1361
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:06,921
No.

1362
01:18:07,054 --> 01:18:08,222
Mm.

1363
01:18:09,957 --> 01:18:12,326
That-- That was my thighs.

1364
01:18:14,895 --> 01:18:15,829
Just gonna...

1365
01:18:27,509 --> 01:18:31,513
By the way, your car is in
the forest, crushed by a tree.

1366
01:18:31,646 --> 01:18:32,547
What?

1367
01:18:33,814 --> 01:18:35,517
I had some kind of stupid idea

1368
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:37,384
that you actually liked me.

1369
01:18:39,453 --> 01:18:40,921
Percy.

1370
01:18:41,055 --> 01:18:42,489
Was any of it real?

1371
01:18:42,624 --> 01:18:44,425
Yes.

1372
01:18:44,559 --> 01:18:47,394
It is real. I've told you things
I've never told anybody.

1373
01:18:49,396 --> 01:18:51,732
I was just
trying to save my house.

1374
01:18:51,865 --> 01:18:53,100
It wasn't personal.

1375
01:18:54,335 --> 01:18:55,769
It felt personal to me.

1376
01:18:55,903 --> 01:18:57,905
Percy, I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

1377
01:18:58,038 --> 01:18:59,708
You should go, I think.

1378
01:19:21,762 --> 01:19:24,431
The truth is, one day
I'll live in Paris or something,

1379
01:19:24,566 --> 01:19:26,133
and I'll come back
to visit Montauk

1380
01:19:26,267 --> 01:19:27,569
and you'll still be here.

1381
01:19:32,072 --> 01:19:34,743
How much money
do your parents have?

1382
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:37,411
Why don't you go ask them?
I know you guys are close.

1383
01:19:37,545 --> 01:19:38,912
But you're rich, right?

1384
01:19:39,046 --> 01:19:40,548
You never have to worry
about money.

1385
01:19:42,249 --> 01:19:45,119
So my life is amazing, right?
I have no problems.

1386
01:19:45,252 --> 01:19:46,721
I'm gonna lose my house.

1387
01:19:49,089 --> 01:19:51,458
And I don't have a rich dad
that can help me.

1388
01:19:51,593 --> 01:19:52,926
Actually, Maddie, you do.

1389
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:54,828
And you're gonna waste
your life in that house

1390
01:19:54,962 --> 01:19:57,331
waiting for him to come back
and apologize.

1391
01:19:57,464 --> 01:19:59,567
Because that's really why
you never made it past New York,

1392
01:19:59,701 --> 01:20:00,602
right?

1393
01:20:50,951 --> 01:20:52,286
What? Gary, no.

1394
01:20:52,419 --> 01:20:54,121
No, no, no.

1395
01:20:54,254 --> 01:20:55,956
This is not my car.

1396
01:20:56,090 --> 01:20:59,828
Well, your name's on the title.
It's your car.

1397
01:21:01,929 --> 01:21:04,733
What am I supposed to do
with a car that doesn't run?

1398
01:21:04,865 --> 01:21:06,033
Who says it doesn't run?

1399
01:21:08,469 --> 01:21:10,204
These things
are built to last.

1400
01:21:12,072 --> 01:21:13,073
Unlike us.

1401
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:16,678
What?

1402
01:21:18,847 --> 01:21:20,180
I didn't say anything.

1403
01:21:30,991 --> 01:21:32,594
What the fuck, you guys?

1404
01:21:32,727 --> 01:21:34,261
Percy, language.

1405
01:21:34,395 --> 01:21:35,730
You don't get to tell me
what to do anymore.

1406
01:21:35,864 --> 01:21:38,365
I'm the parents now.

1407
01:21:38,499 --> 01:21:41,068
What other stuff have you been
doing for me I don't know about?

1408
01:21:43,303 --> 01:21:45,673
That time I beat you in
basketball, did you let me win?

1409
01:21:45,807 --> 01:21:48,375
No. You beat me
fair and square.

1410
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:50,344
What about Kyle McElroy?

1411
01:21:50,477 --> 01:21:52,079
Kyle McElroy.

1412
01:21:52,212 --> 01:21:55,082
The kid who bullied me.
Did you have him expelled?

1413
01:21:55,215 --> 01:21:57,451
No. I was told
it was a dream of his

1414
01:21:57,585 --> 01:21:59,888
to go to military school.

1415
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:03,691
Okay. Whatever--
Whatever this is, it's done.

1416
01:22:03,825 --> 01:22:07,127
You can't track me anymore.
I'm changing my phone passcode.

1417
01:22:07,261 --> 01:22:08,663
To what?

1418
01:22:08,797 --> 01:22:11,165
Okay, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

1419
01:22:11,298 --> 01:22:14,468
I-I know you're trying
to help me, but you're not.

1420
01:22:14,602 --> 01:22:18,673
You have to let me fail
or succeed on my own.

1421
01:22:19,874 --> 01:22:20,775
Understood?

1422
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:24,077
Okay, you can go.

1423
01:22:25,379 --> 01:22:26,280
Okay.

1424
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:31,853
Stop! Leave it.
Yeah.

1425
01:22:55,944 --> 01:22:56,845
Kelly?

1426
01:22:58,245 --> 01:22:59,781
I have your picture.

1427
01:23:02,584 --> 01:23:04,451
Get in.

1428
01:23:04,586 --> 01:23:07,187
I'm not getting in that car.
Get in.

1429
01:23:14,361 --> 01:23:16,129
<i>Finish him!</i>

1430
01:23:20,602 --> 01:23:21,736
<i>Fatality.</i>

1431
01:23:49,429 --> 01:23:53,801
<i>Away, ay, yeah ♪</i>

1432
01:23:56,604 --> 01:23:58,506
To Maddie. You figured it out.

1433
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:01,241
Yeah. I mean, that car's
a little banged up.

1434
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:03,811
Whatever, the summer's over.
We got our town back.

1435
01:24:03,945 --> 01:24:06,213
And we can still have
Thanksgiving at my place.

1436
01:24:08,482 --> 01:24:10,685
Yeah.
What?

1437
01:24:10,818 --> 01:24:11,920
Um...

1438
01:24:13,186 --> 01:24:15,023
Okay.
Fine, I'll do it.

1439
01:24:15,155 --> 01:24:17,291
Here it goes. Uh...

1440
01:24:19,326 --> 01:24:21,029
Sara has something
to tell you.

1441
01:24:22,997 --> 01:24:24,866
Thank you, Jim. Um...

1442
01:24:27,569 --> 01:24:28,970
We're gonna move to Florida,
I think.

1443
01:24:29,102 --> 01:24:30,572
What?

1444
01:24:30,705 --> 01:24:32,707
I know, I know, we wouldn't
if we didn't have to.

1445
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,909
You know that.
I don't wanna move to Florida.

1446
01:24:35,043 --> 01:24:37,579
We just can't afford
to buy our own place here.

1447
01:24:37,712 --> 01:24:39,547
And we can't keep staying
with Jim's parents

1448
01:24:39,681 --> 01:24:40,949
when the baby comes.

1449
01:24:41,081 --> 01:24:44,251
They only have one bathroom.
Can't believe this.

1450
01:24:44,384 --> 01:24:46,219
We're really out of options.
I'm sorry.

1451
01:24:46,353 --> 01:24:47,956
Yeah. We wanna stay.

1452
01:24:48,088 --> 01:24:49,591
Don't be mad.

1453
01:24:49,724 --> 01:24:54,629
I'm not mad. I just...
I can't believe you're leaving.

1454
01:24:54,762 --> 01:24:57,031
Well, I can't believe
you're staying.

1455
01:24:58,332 --> 01:24:59,934
What does that mean?

1456
01:25:00,068 --> 01:25:03,303
Oh, you know what, I just--
My buddy's in the bathroom.

1457
01:25:05,907 --> 01:25:10,745
I just mean that...
I don't know.

1458
01:25:10,878 --> 01:25:12,847
How long are you gonna
keep doing this?

1459
01:25:12,981 --> 01:25:15,950
Having sex for Buicks?
This is probably it.

1460
01:25:16,084 --> 01:25:17,619
That wasn't what I meant.

1461
01:25:17,752 --> 01:25:20,955
I did what I needed to do
to save my mom's house, okay?

1462
01:25:21,089 --> 01:25:23,591
Yeah. You keep saying that,

1463
01:25:23,725 --> 01:25:27,028
but your mom wanted you
to be happy.

1464
01:25:28,128 --> 01:25:29,864
You don't seem happy.

1465
01:25:29,998 --> 01:25:31,633
I am happy.
Are you?

1466
01:25:35,268 --> 01:25:36,470
I like my life here.

1467
01:25:40,173 --> 01:25:41,109
All right.

1468
01:25:42,977 --> 01:25:45,747
I should tell you I go back
to the city tomorrow morning.

1469
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,649
Oh, tomorrow?
Can't you go any sooner?

1470
01:25:48,883 --> 01:25:49,851
You're funny.

1471
01:25:55,723 --> 01:25:59,594
What is this? A finger trap?
I used to love these things.

1472
01:26:03,831 --> 01:26:05,365
You okay?
Mm-hm.

1473
01:26:05,499 --> 01:26:08,268
So do you live in the city?

1474
01:26:08,402 --> 01:26:10,605
Mm-hm.

1475
01:26:10,738 --> 01:26:13,041
Have you been out here
for the whole summer or...?

1476
01:26:13,173 --> 01:26:15,208
What is this,
a questionnaire?

1477
01:26:15,342 --> 01:26:18,012
I was trying
to get to know you.

1478
01:26:18,146 --> 01:26:20,380
I'm sorry. Um...

1479
01:26:24,284 --> 01:26:25,352
I have an idea.

1480
01:26:26,621 --> 01:26:28,422
Close your eyes for me?

1481
01:26:28,556 --> 01:26:30,525
Come on, close them.
Give me your finger.

1482
01:26:34,529 --> 01:26:35,395
Forward.

1483
01:26:36,363 --> 01:26:37,364
Up.

1484
01:26:37,497 --> 01:26:39,067
Okay, open your eyes.

1485
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:40,601
Oh, what the fuck?

1486
01:26:40,735 --> 01:26:43,571
That's disgusting.
Ow! Ow!

1487
01:26:43,705 --> 01:26:45,807
Stop pulling on it!
This was a gift from a friend.

1488
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:47,809
Ow! Ow! Ow! Don't pull it,
don't pull it, don't--

1489
01:26:47,942 --> 01:26:49,577
You have to push in to get out.

1490
01:26:49,711 --> 01:26:50,678
I'm trying.

1491
01:26:56,551 --> 01:26:59,187
That was
kind of weird, huh?

1492
01:27:00,888 --> 01:27:01,823
Anyways.

1493
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:04,559
I live in Battery Park.

1494
01:27:04,692 --> 01:27:06,226
Get out.

1495
01:27:06,359 --> 01:27:07,260
Yeah.

1496
01:27:40,595 --> 01:27:41,495
Here you go.

1497
01:28:02,784 --> 01:28:04,886
<i>- Doug Khan Realty.</i>
<i>- Doug.</i>

1498
01:28:05,019 --> 01:28:07,088
<i>It's Maddie. I wanna sell.</i>

1499
01:28:07,221 --> 01:28:08,288
<i>Great!</i>

1500
01:28:08,421 --> 01:28:09,757
<i>Don't get too excited.</i>

1501
01:28:09,891 --> 01:28:10,792
<i>There's a catch.</i>

1502
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:17,932
Hey, is he here?

1503
01:28:18,065 --> 01:28:19,534
No.

1504
01:28:19,667 --> 01:28:21,836
Well, he won't return
my calls or texts.

1505
01:28:21,969 --> 01:28:23,436
Will you tell him I came in?

1506
01:28:23,571 --> 01:28:25,206
Absolutely fucking not.

1507
01:28:25,338 --> 01:28:26,974
Really?
Yeah.

1508
01:28:27,108 --> 01:28:28,876
You fucked up.
He's a special guy.

1509
01:28:32,814 --> 01:28:34,148
Cocaine!

1510
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:40,621
All right.

1511
01:28:40,755 --> 01:28:42,056
Let's hear it.

1512
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:44,992
"My name is Jody
and I'm a registered..."

1513
01:28:45,126 --> 01:28:48,262
Remember when I said I've made
some powerful friends nannying?

1514
01:28:48,395 --> 01:28:51,364
That includes
the Suffolk County tax assessor.

1515
01:28:51,498 --> 01:28:54,602
And they're gonna make
your property taxes go up.

1516
01:28:54,735 --> 01:28:55,670
Way up.

1517
01:28:55,803 --> 01:28:57,004
I sold the house.

1518
01:29:00,808 --> 01:29:03,511
Sorry, can I actually
use your bathroom?

1519
01:29:03,644 --> 01:29:05,713
It's number two, so...

1520
01:29:05,847 --> 01:29:06,814
Okay.

1521
01:29:09,016 --> 01:29:10,852
It's Maddie.

1522
01:29:10,985 --> 01:29:12,385
Can I talk to him?

1523
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:13,855
<i>He's not home.</i>

1524
01:29:13,988 --> 01:29:16,023
<i>He'll be at</i>
<i>the Princeton mixer later.</i>

1525
01:29:16,157 --> 01:29:18,025
Okay. Thanks.

1526
01:29:45,686 --> 01:29:48,222
And there are several
eating clubs to choose from,

1527
01:29:48,356 --> 01:29:49,857
if you make it to junior year.

1528
01:29:51,893 --> 01:29:54,195
I can't wait to be eaten
at Princeton.

1529
01:29:54,328 --> 01:29:55,830
What?
I've tried calling you.

1530
01:29:55,963 --> 01:29:57,497
You can't just ignore me.

1531
01:29:57,632 --> 01:29:58,733
Leave me alone.

1532
01:29:58,866 --> 01:30:00,268
Percy,
don't shut me out.

1533
01:30:01,636 --> 01:30:03,571
I don't owe you anything.
Stop.

1534
01:30:03,704 --> 01:30:05,239
Percy.

1535
01:30:05,373 --> 01:30:08,441
I don't owe you anything.
I don't owe you anything.

1536
01:30:08,576 --> 01:30:10,211
Well, I owe you something.

1537
01:30:10,344 --> 01:30:12,079
Our friendship is real.

1538
01:30:12,213 --> 01:30:15,583
You made me realize
I needed to push in to get out.

1539
01:30:15,716 --> 01:30:19,186
I was hurt. So I hurt people.

1540
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:22,356
Percy. Percy.

1541
01:30:22,489 --> 01:30:25,425
Percy, unlock the door.
Come on, open the door.

1542
01:30:25,559 --> 01:30:26,594
Please, let's talk.

1543
01:30:31,365 --> 01:30:32,266
What are you doing?

1544
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,668
Get off the hood.

1545
01:30:33,801 --> 01:30:35,269
I don't want anything
to do with you.

1546
01:30:35,403 --> 01:30:37,738
I'm not getting off
until you talk to me.

1547
01:30:39,073 --> 01:30:40,675
Then I guess we're doing this.

1548
01:30:42,376 --> 01:30:45,746
Hey, okay. Easy. Easy. Fuck.

1549
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,915
This is scary.
I can't believe you did this.

1550
01:30:48,049 --> 01:30:49,083
Then get off!

1551
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:51,018
No! Not until you believe me

1552
01:30:51,152 --> 01:30:52,586
that I care about you.

1553
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:55,556
You lied to me just so you
could get a fucking car.

1554
01:30:55,690 --> 01:30:56,891
You don't give a shit about me.

1555
01:30:57,024 --> 01:30:58,125
Yes, I do.

1556
01:30:58,259 --> 01:30:59,927
Pull over! Let's talk!

1557
01:31:01,362 --> 01:31:03,463
Get off the hood of my car!

1558
01:31:03,597 --> 01:31:04,632
Make me!

1559
01:31:06,534 --> 01:31:08,169
Had enough?
No!

1560
01:31:08,302 --> 01:31:09,603
Oh, my God!

1561
01:31:09,737 --> 01:31:12,006
Aah! I can't see!

1562
01:31:12,139 --> 01:31:13,975
- Oh, my God!
- You're blocking me!

1563
01:31:14,108 --> 01:31:15,176
Percy!

1564
01:31:21,248 --> 01:31:22,183
Fire!

1565
01:31:34,829 --> 01:31:35,696
Oh, shit.

1566
01:31:36,496 --> 01:31:37,398
Oh, my God.

1567
01:31:41,002 --> 01:31:42,036
Oh, shit.

1568
01:31:49,043 --> 01:31:50,077
Maddie?

1569
01:31:50,211 --> 01:31:51,178
Maddie!

1570
01:31:51,312 --> 01:31:52,213
Maddie!

1571
01:31:56,317 --> 01:31:57,385
It's okay.

1572
01:32:03,024 --> 01:32:03,991
I'm sorry.

1573
01:32:05,159 --> 01:32:06,193
I'm sorry.

1574
01:32:28,716 --> 01:32:29,917
I just got my license

1575
01:32:30,051 --> 01:32:31,685
and I've already ruined
two cars.

1576
01:32:33,154 --> 01:32:35,556
The Buick's not ruined.
I fixed it up.

1577
01:32:38,426 --> 01:32:39,894
It just needed a little love.

1578
01:32:41,629 --> 01:32:43,597
My grandfather shot himself
in that Buick.

1579
01:32:45,666 --> 01:32:46,567
I'm kidding.

1580
01:32:48,369 --> 01:32:49,270
You little shit.

1581
01:32:50,604 --> 01:32:52,873
You're lucky
I came back for you.

1582
01:32:53,007 --> 01:32:54,375
Where would you be
without me?

1583
01:32:56,744 --> 01:32:59,280
I'd definitely
still be a virgin.

1584
01:33:00,881 --> 01:33:02,583
You're still a virgin,
hotshot.

1585
01:33:02,716 --> 01:33:03,951
No, that counts, actually.

1586
01:33:05,653 --> 01:33:07,054
Well, you can tell
your friends in college

1587
01:33:07,188 --> 01:33:08,089
whatever you want.

1588
01:33:09,757 --> 01:33:11,258
If I make any friends.

1589
01:33:13,894 --> 01:33:15,463
What do you mean?
We're friends.

1590
01:33:22,036 --> 01:33:25,106
I think we're probably gonna
come back out for Thanksgiving.

1591
01:33:25,239 --> 01:33:26,273
I won't be here.

1592
01:33:28,042 --> 01:33:30,778
I sold the house.
I'm-I'm moving to California.

1593
01:33:41,288 --> 01:33:42,524
You're gonna be okay.

1594
01:33:45,759 --> 01:33:47,761
What are you,
some kind of wise Buddha?

1595
01:33:47,895 --> 01:33:49,997
I'm older than you.
<i>You're</i> gonna be okay.

1596
01:33:52,266 --> 01:33:53,502
We're both gonna be okay.

1597
01:34:02,977 --> 01:34:04,245
Maddie?

1598
01:34:04,378 --> 01:34:05,580
Yeah?

1599
01:34:05,713 --> 01:34:06,747
It still counts.

1600
01:34:13,555 --> 01:34:15,756
Am I being executed?
Is that the surprise?

1601
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:16,924
No peeking!

1602
01:34:17,057 --> 01:34:18,359
Yeah, no.
This is good news.

1603
01:34:18,492 --> 01:34:19,660
You're not
blindfolding me

1604
01:34:19,793 --> 01:34:21,095
to tell me
you're having an affair?

1605
01:34:21,228 --> 01:34:22,296
All right.

1606
01:34:26,834 --> 01:34:28,002
What am I looking at?

1607
01:34:28,135 --> 01:34:30,004
The house.
The house.

1608
01:34:30,137 --> 01:34:32,139
Instead of selling it to
some rich asshole,

1609
01:34:32,273 --> 01:34:33,741
I decided to sell it
to you guys.

1610
01:34:33,874 --> 01:34:35,976
Yeah,
a regular asshole.

1611
01:34:36,110 --> 01:34:38,846
Who had to sell
one of the boats.

1612
01:34:38,979 --> 01:34:40,347
Maddie, we-we can't.

1613
01:34:40,481 --> 01:34:42,750
No, we can. And she could've
gotten more for it.

1614
01:34:42,883 --> 01:34:44,218
I got enough.

1615
01:34:44,351 --> 01:34:46,487
This is how we stay.

1616
01:34:46,621 --> 01:34:48,355
This is what we wanted.

1617
01:34:48,489 --> 01:34:50,559
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1618
01:34:52,993 --> 01:34:53,894
Oh, wait.

1619
01:34:55,863 --> 01:34:59,534
Oh, right,
the thing you made.

1620
01:34:59,668 --> 01:35:01,670
There it is.
Should we put it up?

1621
01:35:01,802 --> 01:35:03,404
Mm-hm.
Ahem. We will do that.

1622
01:35:03,538 --> 01:35:04,972
We're gonna do it
as soon as you leave.

1623
01:35:06,508 --> 01:35:08,375
Well, I guess this is it.

1624
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:10,377
Call us as soon
as you get there, okay?

1625
01:35:10,512 --> 01:35:12,547
Or don't.
Totally fine either way.

1626
01:35:12,681 --> 01:35:13,648
Yeah. We're cool.

1627
01:35:13,781 --> 01:35:15,015
Are you guys gonna be okay?

1628
01:35:15,149 --> 01:35:16,250
Yeah. Yeah.

1629
01:35:16,383 --> 01:35:18,319
Empty nesters. Finally, heh.

1630
01:35:19,621 --> 01:35:21,523
Yeah, come on.
Get out of here, you.

1631
01:35:27,861 --> 01:35:29,063
I love you guys.

1632
01:35:29,196 --> 01:35:30,931
And we love you so much.
Love you too, huh?

1633
01:35:31,065 --> 01:35:32,199
Please don't follow me out.

1634
01:35:32,333 --> 01:35:33,602
No. Ha, ha!
Okay.

1635
01:35:33,734 --> 01:35:34,768
Okay.

1636
01:35:37,672 --> 01:35:39,574
Sure you don't want
help with the bags?

1637
01:35:39,708 --> 01:35:40,908
No, I got it.

1638
01:35:47,448 --> 01:35:49,483
Well, let him do it.

1639
01:35:49,618 --> 01:35:50,784
Yeah. Oh!

1640
01:35:55,389 --> 01:35:56,323
Honey.

1641
01:35:59,927 --> 01:36:01,328
Yeah, that's it.

1642
01:36:01,462 --> 01:36:02,830
- That's worth it.
- Yeah!

1643
01:36:02,963 --> 01:36:04,298
Um... Okay.

1644
01:36:05,432 --> 01:36:07,201
All right.

1645
01:36:07,334 --> 01:36:09,270
All right, guys. See you.
Bye, sweetie.

1646
01:36:13,073 --> 01:36:14,241
Whoo!

1647
01:36:14,375 --> 01:36:15,309
Okay.

1648
01:36:15,442 --> 01:36:17,411
Nice! All right.
Yeah.

1649
01:36:17,545 --> 01:36:18,812
I'll see you guys
for Thanksgiving.

1650
01:36:18,946 --> 01:36:20,247
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.

1651
01:36:24,051 --> 01:36:24,985
Wrong way, heh.

1652
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:26,387
Bye!
Bye, sweetheart.

1653
01:36:35,896 --> 01:36:37,831
Your Uber's here.

1654
01:36:37,965 --> 01:36:40,000
I requested no conversation.

1655
01:36:40,134 --> 01:36:43,937
Oh, we're talking, buddy.
All the way to Princeton.

1656
01:36:44,071 --> 01:36:47,542
Then I'm gonna call you for
my whole drive to California.

1657
01:36:47,676 --> 01:36:49,176
Tell you about
my new boyfriend.

1658
01:36:51,412 --> 01:36:53,013
New boyfriend?

1659
01:36:53,147 --> 01:36:54,683
He's a former cop.

1660
01:36:54,815 --> 01:36:55,949
Okay.

1661
01:36:56,083 --> 01:36:58,018
He's had some drug addiction
in the past.

1662
01:36:58,152 --> 01:36:59,119
Uh-huh.

1663
01:37:00,287 --> 01:37:02,724
Do you want to meet him?
No.

1664
01:37:02,856 --> 01:37:05,359
Well, he really wants
to meet you. Come on!

1665
01:37:05,492 --> 01:37:07,696
Milo! Hey! Hey.

1666
01:37:10,831 --> 01:37:12,866
You ready to leave?

1667
01:37:14,234 --> 01:37:15,269
Yeah.

1668
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:17,171
Are you?

1669
01:37:17,304 --> 01:37:18,839
Yeah.
