1
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,522
<i>The authorities in Russia
are bracing themselves today</i>

2
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,854
<i>for mass protests
against the trial</i>

3
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,148
<i>of former billionaire
Yuri Komarov.</i>

4
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,653
<i>The case against Mr. Komarov</i>

5
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,986
<i>has caused widespread division
amongst the Russian public,</i>

6
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,493
<i>some of whom view his incarceration
as a political maneuver</i>

7
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,030
<i>orchestrated by this man,</i>

8
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,577
<i>defense minister
candidate Viktor Chagarin.</i>

9
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,465
<i>What do you want Viktor?</i>

10
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,354
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

11
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,687
<i>What do you want to accomplish tomorrow?</i>

12
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,904
<i>I'm prepared to pay for my sins.</i>

13
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,201
<i>You should prepare yourself too.</i>

14
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:52,529
<i>Yuri,</i>

15
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:58,499
<i>let's be civil about this. We were friends once...</i>

16
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,371
<i>...are could be again.</i>

17
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,841
<i>Just give me the file...</i>

18
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,889
<i>...and I'll hand your life back to you.</i>

19
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,010
<i>Forget this stupid trial.</i>

20
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,230
<i>I don't want my life back.</i>

21
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:32,780
<i>You think I'm going to let you talk tomorrow?</i>

22
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,583
<i>No one is going to hear you!</i>

23
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,203
<i>I own everybody in that courtroom.</i>

24
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,460
<i>You don't own me.</i>

25
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,269
Mike.

26
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,648
Chagarin's making
a move on Komarov.

27
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,983
Shit.
I'll see if we got local.

28
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,713
<i>We are ready to get started.</i>

29
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,344
<i>Make the call.</i>

30
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,814
<i>You won't disappoint me?</i>

31
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,693
<i>Have I ever disappointed you?</i>

32
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:38,820
<i>Anton.</i>

33
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,366
<i>Alik, it's Viktor.</i>

34
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,419
<i>Yuri Komarov says hello...</i>

35
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:48,713
<i>It's time to grab him.</i>

36
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,548
<i>Yuri Komarov?</i>

37
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,251
<i>...and Goodbye.</i>

38
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,243
McClane.

39
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,914
Hey, Murph, how you doing?

40
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,167
Nice grouping, Grandpa.

41
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,204
Yeah, not bad.

42
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,083
Is that it?

43
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,716
Yep. We found him.

44
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,510
It's not good, John.

45
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,843
Hospital or morgue?

46
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,767
Worse.

47
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,233
When was the last time
you spoke to this kid?

48
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,562
It's been a while.

49
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,274
Maybe a few years, even.

50
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,446
Last time I saw him,
it was pretty ugly.

51
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,493
Well, there's a few different
versions in there,

52
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:12,381
but my people are pretty sure he's
being held at a Moscow prison

53
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,883
awaiting sentencing.

54
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,839
What's he charged with?

55
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,219
It's a nasty sheet.

56
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,433
He'll be lucky to get life.

57
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,765
He can never get
out of his own way.

58
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,527
He had a lot of problems.

59
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,814
He's still my kid.

60
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,034
I know.

61
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:45,572
But it's Russia. They do
things differently over there.

62
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,743
Me, too.

63
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,913
Good luck, Poppy.

64
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:54,964
Thanks, kid.

65
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,481
God damn you! God damn it!

66
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,831
<i>Welcome to John F.
Kennedy International Airport.</i>

67
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,329
Thanks, kid.

68
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,331
McClane, good luck.

69
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,415
See you soon.

70
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,917
<i>I was told you had something to offer me?</i>

71
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,514
<i>You're looking for evidence against Yuri Komarov?</i>

72
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,310
<i>Perhaps.</i>

73
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,104
<i>Put me in the courtroom with him...</i>

74
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,817
<i>...and I'll testify that Komarov hired me to murder Anton.</i>

75
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,196
<i>Did he?</i>

76
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,988
<i>I'll testify under oath.</i>

77
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,862
<i>That's good enough, isn't it?</i>

78
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,537
...Draganskiy courthouse?

79
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,121
You speak Russian?

80
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,958
How did I do?

81
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,546
Well, you asked for
a large bag of hair

82
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,210
on the way to
Draganskiy courthouse.

83
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,634
But I got it.
I got it.

84
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,219
Good.

85
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,385
Traffic sucks here, too, huh?

86
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,515
Sex?

87
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,682
You want sex? Sexy clubs?

88
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,857
No. No sex.

89
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,852
It sucks, this traffic.

90
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,816
What is it? An accident?

91
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,522
No.

92
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,733
Garden Ring. Is bad.

93
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,529
Always traffic, always traffic.

94
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,490
You're American?

95
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,536
Yeah, American. New York.

96
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,713
The Big Apple.

97
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:10,505
<i>I want to wake up
in that city that never sleeps</i>

98
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,840
That's it.
Never sleeps.

99
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,259
Frank Sinatra.
Chairman of the Board.

100
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,722
That's right.

101
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,434
The Chairman. Yeah.

102
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,395
You sing good.

103
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:27,526
<i>These little town
blues are melting away</i>

104
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,026
Yes, I sing.

105
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,941
I sing all the time.

106
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,279
Yeah.

107
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,574
<i>King of the hill
Top of the world</i>

108
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,700
Huh?

109
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,373
Heap. "Top of the heap."

110
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,371
All right, all right. Draganskiy
courthouse, right there.

111
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,584
Two blocks.

112
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:49,593
You better walk, traffic is bad.
Really bad.

113
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,798
What do I owe you?

114
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:51,924
Hey, no money.

115
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,716
No money, you let me sing.
You let me sing.

116
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,226
You listen to my singing.
No money.

117
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,102
Welcome to Moscow.

118
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:05,058
<i>That little
town blues are melting away</i>

119
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,615
<i>I'm gonna
make a brand new start of it</i>

120
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,068
<i>In old New York</i>

121
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,350
<i>...protests
in central Moscow,</i>

122
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,310
<i>following a day of
demonstrations in Russia.</i>

123
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,938
<i>The unrest comes as authorities have been
accused of fraud</i>

124
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,139
<i>throughout the country's elections.</i>

125
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,941
<i>...some pictures
out of Russia right now.</i>

126
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,393
<i>Protests happening there.</i>

127
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,194
<i>This is a look
at the demonstration.</i>

128
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,339
<i>Quiet!</i>

129
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,751
<i>Order in the courtroom!</i>

130
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,054
<i>Order in the courtroom!</i>

131
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,885
<i>Order!</i>

132
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,555
<i>Seal the doors!</i>

133
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,279
Detonator.

134
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,159
<i>But, sir... the drivers?</i>

135
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,784
Detonator.

136
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,387
It's gonna be loud.

137
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,572
Hey!

138
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:46,923
<i>Quick!</i>

139
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:51,723

<i>The cage.</i>

144
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,488
<i>Check the cage.</i>

145
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,085
<i>They are not here.</i>

146
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,584
<i>No kidding.</i>

148
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,054
<i>Take Komarov alive...</i>

<i>Your best friend.</i>

156

Jack!

157
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,295
Dad?

158
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,087
Get out of the van!

159
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,592
What are you doing here?

160
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,102
Jack! Hey!

161
00:18:58,846 --> 00:18:59,847
Jack!

162
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,685
Shit.

163
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:07,943
<i>Komarov! Komarov!</i>

Go home.

167
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,619
What the fuck
do you think...? Jack!

168
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,363
You're out of your depth, John.

169
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,406
Jack! What are you doing?

170
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,794
No! No!

171
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,205
<i>We need him alive!</i>

172
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,664
Jack!

173
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,668
You're gonna shoot me?

174
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,380
You're gonna
shoot your own father?

175
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,508
You shouldn't be here, John.

176
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:37,968
You shouldn't be here.

177
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,103
What are you doing?

178
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,436
Jack!

179
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,439
Whoa!

180
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,779
You're gonna
fucking run over me?

181
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,819
You're only making it worse!

182
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:55,903
Jack.

183
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,601
Get out of the way!

184
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,721
Call a cop!

185
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:48,914
Come on, go!

186
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,568
Idiot.

187
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:26,043
Reaper One?
Reaper One from 6-1-0.

188
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,295
Who's got him?

189
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,376
Clock's running. Foxy.

190
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,881
On the paper now. Box on.

191
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,916
Copy that. Box on.

192
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:32,758
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

193
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,466
<i>6-1, Reaper, we read you.
Go ahead.</i>

194
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:36,917
Reaper, how are we looking?

195
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,013
Your guy is late.

196
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,931
His rate of
progress is way off.

197
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,642
MET now plus 6 minutes.

198
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,897
MCC Reaper. MET now plus 6.

199
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,339
This is
un-frigging-believable.

200
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,233
MCC Reaper.
That's not how it works.

201
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,565
Something's off. I know this guy.
This doesn't happen.

202
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,402
MCC Reaper, 6-1 is in the hole.
Stand by.

203
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,441
6-1, be advised,
your window is closed.

204
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:58,780
Time on target is no-go.

205
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,911
I say again, TOT is no-go.

206
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,620
Reaper, this is real-world,
not exercise, do you copy?

207
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,577
No, sir, Moscow police will
have shut down the Garden Ring.

208
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,662
Reaper!
He's no-go for extraction.

209
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,251
It's too late. Shut it down.

210
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,335
Pull it!

211
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,695
6-1, mission window is closed.
Reaper is out of here.

212
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,752
Come on!

213
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,091
Shit!

214
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,422
Get me Operations.

215
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,681
Reaper!

216
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,267
Get Mike Collins looped in.

217
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,970
Tell him it's Plan B,
safehouse. Go now!

218
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,347
<i>Plan B. No choice.</i>

219
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:28,764
Shit.

220
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,184
It's blown.
They shut the Garden Ring.

221
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,029
Harvest is in effect.
Keep on working.

222
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,272
Let's finish this, Foxy.

223
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,693
Damn you, McClane!

224
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,324
Damn you!

225
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,849
Oh, fuck!

226
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,480
Jack!
I'm not done talking to you!

227
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,773
Who is this?

228
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,029
Come on, go!

229
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,589
Concentrate, please.

230
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,301
That's right,
come on through, yeah!

231
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,570
See if you can hit this guy!

232
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,051
Jesus!

233
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,952
I'm tired of this guy.

234
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,030
RPG now!

235
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,160
Jesus!

236
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,939
You missed!
Interesting choice, man.

237
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,164
Hey, hey!

238
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,328
Hey!

239
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,750
Whoa!

240
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,460
Hey! Whoa!

241
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,422
Come on!

242
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,258
You gotta be
fucking kidding me!

243
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:36,933
What?

244
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:43,269
Do you think I understand
a word you're saying?

245
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,240
Jesus Christ.

246
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,277
It's okay, I'm fine, thanks.

247
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,254
Oh, man, you're
driving like my grandma!

248
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,920
When I say drive, I mean fly!

249
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,973
Oh, yeah!

250
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,496
Get out of the way!

251
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,582
Oh, God.

252
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,501
Jesus!

253
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,764
Oh, for the love of...

254
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,113
Sorry, ma'am!

255
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:25,954
Sorry!

256
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,048
Did you see this guy?

257
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:26,686
Oh, man!

258
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,183
Knock knock.

259
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:53,667
Guess who!

260
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,357
I've had enough of this shit.

261
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,984
Oh, man, hey!

262
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,362
Is that it?
Is that your best shot?

263
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,566
Damn you, John.

264
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,273
Damn you!

265
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,390
Hey! Up here!

266
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,689
Shoot up here!

267
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,945
John! Get in!

268
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,328
Get in before I change my mind.
Jesus!

269
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,619
Take your time.

270
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,005
Jack,
what the fuck was that, huh?

271
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,257
Shut up.
Shut up, John.

272
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,496
I swear to God, I will put
a bullet in you this time.

273
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,003
Who do you think
you're talking to?

274
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,546
The last person I want to see.

275
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,306
Well, maybe you missed
the whole part back there

276
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,341
where I saved you
and Papa Geppetto here

277
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,385
from a whole bunch
of Russian bad guys.

278
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,554
You saved? You saved?

279
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,097
That's right, saved.

280
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,733
Shut up.
Shut up.

281
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,526
You're a world class screw-up,
you know that, John?

282
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,154
I'm a screw-up?
I'm a screw-up?

283
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,313
I'm still your father.

284
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,024
Yeah,
nothing I can do about that.

285
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,608
What a joke.

286
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,277
Just shut up. Try not to
touch anything, all right?

287
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,071
You've done
enough goddamn damage.

288
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,625
<i>The appointment is next week...</i>

289
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,289
<i>We will begin immediately.</i>

290
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,291
<i>Excuse me, sir. Komarov has escaped.</i>

291
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,326
<i>I'll call you back. There is a problem with Komarov.</i>

292
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,249
<i>What happened?</i>

293
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,228
<i>Some sort of attack on the courthouse.</i>

294
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:42,635
<i>Who took him?</i>

295
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:43,712
<i>They don't know yet.</i>

296
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,548
<i>What do you mean you don't know?</i>

297
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:46,464
<i>Eh...</i>

298
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,266
<i>...well it's confusing...</i>

299
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,307
<i>Eyewitnesses say they saw Komarov...</i>

300
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,022
<i>...with an American.</i>

301
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,483
<i>What American?</i>

302
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,443
John McClane.

303
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:05,991
Let's go.

304
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,364
After you.

305
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,913
Yeah, I got him.
Okay, I'm on it.

306
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,373
Look, Mike, we had an unexpected delay.
I'm sorry.

307
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:17,500
I understand.

308
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,798
This is the last guy on earth
I expected to see.

309
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,316
Listen to me, Yuri, you have
half of Moscow looking for you.

310
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,135
Okay I need you to get dressed, please.
Why am I here?

311
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:27,013
Just please put on these clothes.
Trust me.

312
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,300
This is the key to your cuffs.
Take these.

313
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:30,718
Oh, my Jesus.

314
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,352
Are you okay?
What?

315
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,934
Do you have
the file on Chagarin?

316
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,392
This is what you
been doing, Jack?

317
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,234
Spy shit?

318
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,114
This is it?

319
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,242
You're a spy? Oh, my God.

320
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,785
The 007 of Plainfield,
New Jersey.

321
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,623
Very nice.

322
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,831
McClane, shut up.

323
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,704
Take it easy, Odd job.

324
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,713
I'm on vacation.

325
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,215
Your mom will be pleased.

326
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,172
We thought you were
doing drugs or something.

327
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:05,381
Mr. Komarov.

328
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:08,096
Or selling drugs,
but that was me, really.

329
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,471
Do you have
the file on Chagarin?

330
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,601
Yes, or no?

331
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:16,855
It's very simple, Yuri.

332
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,225
You give me the file,
and I get you out of Russia.

333
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:22,812
And you're a free man.
What do you say?

334
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:28,947
It's not about me.
I don't care about my life.

335
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,661
Well, that's the deal.

336
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,117
It's the only deal.

337
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,116
Come on.

338
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,836
Come on, Yuri. Help yourself.

339
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:42,039
What's it gonna be?

340
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,918
Yes or no?

341
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,883
The clock is ticking, Yuri.
Come on.

342
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,923
You will get me out of here?

343
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,182
Only the three of you?

344
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,560
Whoa, Nijinsky.
I'm not in the gang.

345
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,017
I just got off the plane.
I'm still jet-lagged.

346
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,058
I'm not involved in this.
Huh, Jack?

347
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,279
Only if I can take
my daughter with me.

348
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,861
Chagarin's people
will kill her.

349
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,323
Fine. Make it quick.

350
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,533
Ah.

351
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:19,994
Where's the file?

352
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,915
It's in a vault in Prypiat, but
the key is here in Moscow.

353
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,206
At Hotel Ukraina.

354
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,667
Shit.

355
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,681
Make your call. We're going
to the Ukraina, let's go.

356
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:41,560
<i>It's papa..</i>.

357
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,855
<i>I'm fine, Sunshine...</i>

358
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,486
<i>...we'll talk later.</i>

359
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:47,729
<i>Listen.</i>

360
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,108
<i>I'll be waiting for you
where your mother and I shared our first dance.</i>

361
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,362
<i>Now.</i>

362
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,829
<i>Hurry! Hurry! You understand?</i>

363
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,966
Mike, listen, I'm sorry
about this morning, man.

364
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,675
It's fine.

365
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,182
Okay, let's go.

366
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,680
Contact!

367
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,271
Down! Get down!

368
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,111
Go! Get down! Go, go, go!

369
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,903
John, cover!

370
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,624
Come on, buddy!

371
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,053
Go! Go!

372
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,395
That's right, jerk-off!

373
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,642
All right, let's move, John!

374
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,182
I'm on fucking vacation!

375
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,225
Come on, time to hustle.
Watch your head.

376
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,270
McClane, move it.

377
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,314
8,000 fucking miles for this?

378
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,154
Get down, Yuri. Stay low!

379
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:20,530
Head down.

380
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,407
Come on. Go, go!

381
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,756
Safe house, my ass.

382
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,645
He knows how old we are, no?

383
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:45,730
Come on.

384
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,936
Here, here, here.

385
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,281
Sit down.
You're all right.

386
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,691
Let me look at you.

387
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,617
It's all right.
You're fine.

388
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,198
What are you doing?

389
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,696
Jack.

390
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,700
Calm down, Yuri, okay?
You're gonna be just fine.

391
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,581
Here, put this on, stay warm.

392
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,210
What was that, John? 5 minutes?
5 minutes?

393
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,090
You blew a 3-year op
in 5 minutes!

394
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,889
You're welcome!
What do you want me to do?

395
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,139
Unbelievable.

396
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,392
I'm so fucking burned. I got no
friends in this town anymore.

397
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,394
What about your people at Langley?
Just give them a call.

398
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,806
Give me your phone.

399
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,736
It's a 2-year contract
on that phone.

400
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,072
What are you carrying?
Give me that.

401
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,697
All right.
You got any cash on you?

402
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,374
Some American money.

403
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,956
What are you talking about?
We need to keep on moving.

404
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,755
We have to get this guy to a doctor.
To medical attention, Jack.

405
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:53,915
The mission stands.

406
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,467
Your mission is
bleeding out over there.

407
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,754
The mission continues.
We go to the hotel.

408
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,140
Come on, let's move.
Let's move.

409
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,944
This is nuts.

410
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:20,825
What, are you going to go out
and kill somebody else now?

411
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,736
Why all this trouble
for just one guy?

412
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,662
He's a political prisoner.

413
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:26,330
Not that you care, John,

414
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,787
but it's a matter of national
security, all right?

415
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,420
He's got the goods to stop Viktor
Chagarin, and we need that to happen.

416
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:33,626
Well, great, Jack.

417
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,665
Let's drop him off at the
Embassy, and we can go home.

418
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,335
Are you kidding me? After what
happened at the safe house?

419
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,012
Look, it doesn't work
like that, all right?

420
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,290
It's a huge diplomatic mess,
and I'm a burnable asset.

421
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,138
So, I now need that file
to un-fuck this mission.

422
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,434
Any more questions?

423
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,016
Yeah, just one.

424
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,306
How come you never called
and told me where you were?

425
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,475
Like you'd give a shit.

426
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:12,790
Shit.

427
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,126
Well, we're not going in the front door.

428
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,258
All right, hold up, hold up.

429
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,354
Okay, Yuri, listen to me, all right?
We're almost done.

430
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,019
As soon as we get that key,
we're gonna grab the file,

431
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,228
get you and your daughter
out of Russia, all right?

432
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,692
All right.

433
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:45,869
All right listen to me, you're doing good.
All right?

434
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,347
I need you to hang here a second.
Keep an eye on him, John.

435
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,572
Hey, hey.

436
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:53,369
What is it with all this "John" shit?
Whatever happened to "Dad?"

437
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,708
Good question.

438
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,592
In Russia, we have
word for men like him.

439
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:03,879
<i>"Krutoi."</i>

440
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,970
It means "tough,"
"hard."

441
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,477
In America, it means
"juvenile delinquent."

442
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,648
Is he your only child?

443
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:20,069
No. I got a daughter, too.

444
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,114
You?

445
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,828
I have only my <i>Solnyschka.</i>

446
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,995
When she was little,
I was working all the time.

447
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,912
I believed work was
all that mattered.

448
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,836
I screwed my
kid's life up, too.

449
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,087
You work all the time

450
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,094
around the clock most of the
time, when you're a cop.

451
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:54,934
I just thought that working all the
time was a good thing, you know?

452
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,437
I didn't help him at all.

453
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,446
It's never too late,

454
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,948
I hope.

455
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,790
Okay, let's go.

456
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,939
All right, Yuri, which part of
the building is the ballroom in?

457
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:27,962
Main tower.

458
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,676
Main tower.
Which floor?

459
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,471
Top floor.

460
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:33,593
What about security?

461
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,519
You remember any guards?
Cameras? Anything like that?

462
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,555
I don't know.

463
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,224
Well, I need you to remember.

464
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,392
I was in prison for 5
years, how should I know?

465
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,360
Everything could have changed.
I know.

466
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,193
Just think, all right?
Picture it in your head.

467
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,991
The ballroom was closed in '89.

468
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,152
I think it's under
construction now.

469
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,908
So that floor's unsecured.

470
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,369
I don't know! Listen!
My daughter is in there.

471
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:56,700
I'm scared to death, let's go!

472
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,330
Just calm down, Yuri.

473
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:25,941
I guess you have
done that before.

474
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,907
Smart.

475
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,783
I could have done it.

476
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,745
Irina?

477
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,748
Irina?

478
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,677
Irina?

479
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,799
Papa.

480
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,263
Irina.
Papa!

481
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,143
That's tender.

482
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,691
Really? I wouldn't know.

483
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,624
Need a hug?

484
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:06,538
We're not really
a hugging family.

485
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,297
That's right.

486
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,509
<i>We just have to get one thing...</i>

487
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,299
<i>...and then we're leaving Moscow for good.</i>

488
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:15,630
<i>OK?</i>

489
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:16,630
<i>OK.</i>

490
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,477
<i>Who are they?</i>

491
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,524
The young one works for CIA.

492
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,148
The old one is his father.
Americans.

493
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,155
<i>Then thank God for them.</i>

494
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,493
There's something
no good about this.

495
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,033
Just shut up, all right?

496
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:45,917
I'm telling you, Jack,

497
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,329
this smells bad.

498
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,004
Just stop, okay?

499
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:56,713
This might seem like a totally
foreign concept, you know?

500
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,177
I know you love to just
run in, making shit up.

501
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,971
But like any professional,
I have a plan.

502
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,931
So let's just
stick to it, okay?

503
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,562
Just move your plan along.

504
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,855
All right, Yuri, come on. Let's
grab the key, get out of here.

505
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,436
Yes.

506
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,893
Just take a moment.

507
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,371
How you doing?

508
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:34,501
Fine.

509
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,225
How did you get
over here so quick?

510
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,770
Well...

511
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:54,483
I took Garden Ring.

512
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:58,905
Oh, the Garden Ring. Supposed
to always be bad, right?

513
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,161
Hey, John.

514
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:11,613
Did you get stuck in traffic?

515
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,212
I have it! I have it.

516
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,426
Welcome, Americans.

517
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,813
Put your goddamn
guns down, asshole!

518
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,490
<i>Papa, what is going on?</i>

519
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,697
Give me your weapons.

520
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:47,741
Come and get them.

521
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,338
Really?

522
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:57,671
Really.

523
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,545
Papa.

524
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,307
Yuri.

525
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,718
Do it.

526
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,684
I thought you were
a problem child.

527
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,701
This a part of your plan,
Mr. Professional?

528
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,871
<i>What are you doing?</i>

529
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,048
<i>It's about money, papa...</i>

530
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,126
<i>...millions of dollars.</i>

531
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:41,798
<i>You think life was easy for me?</i>

532
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,800
<i>While you were sitting in prison being a victim?</i>

533
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,136
But.

534
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,642
I'm your father.

535
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,229
And I am your daughter.

536
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,936
We should kill the old man now.

537
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,445
We still need him.

538
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,197
But them you can kill.

539
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,194
Thank you.

540
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:07,491
Hi.

541
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,324
I don't know if I'm
saying this right.

542
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:13,826
Hi.

543
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,878
Do you know what I hate
about the Americans?

544
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,293
Everything.

545
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,884
Especially cowboys.

546
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:02,342
I could have been a dancer.
I swear to God.

547
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,556
But nobody supported me.

548
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,095
You two

549
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:20,101
have been such a

550
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:23,404
pain in the ass!

551
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,449
Come on, come on!

552
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,131
I prefer dancing, really.

553
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:48,721
But killing is much, much better
than working in a grocery shop!

554
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,134
Jesus Christ!

555
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:57,846
Nice one.

556
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,867
You guys. So arrogant.

557
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:16,331
It's not 1986, you know.

558
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:20,332
Reagan is dead.

559
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,629
Sorry. Oh, God.

560
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,891
What's funny there?

561
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:43,726
Can't tell you.

562
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:47,188
It's not you.
I love these outfits.

563
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,528
You guys are looking good.

564
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,876
That was enough, thank you.

565
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:05,210
Let's dance.

566
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:23,932
Come on! Come on!

567
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,412
Jack!

568
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,033
Remember the last time we talked
just before you went away?

569
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,166
Oh, no! No, no!

570
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,797
You're not gonna open up
to me right before we die!

571
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,213
No,
that's not your thing, John.

572
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:51,502
What's my thing?

573
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,967
Fucking killing bad guys,
that's your thing!

574
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,307
You're not gonna die today!

575
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,454
Go!

576
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,904
Shit!

577
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,655
Fuck.

578
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,374
We're finished, John.

579
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,841
<i>I'm taking care of it now.</i>

580
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,228
I can't believe this.

581
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:38,367
I can't believe this.
This is unbelievable.

582
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,831
Jack. Hey!

583
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:57,878
Jesus!

584
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:02,633
Come on!

585
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:11,756
Let's get out of this building!

586
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:28,325
<i>Where are they?</i>

587
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,415
Come on.

588
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:01,901
<i>Alik, that's it. We're done!</i>

589
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:02,610
<i>Let's go!</i>

590
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:03,489
<i>Break left!</i>

591
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:04,528
<i>Copy, Commander.</i>

592
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:39,818
<i>Do you have him?</i>

593
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,402
Yes.

594
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:42,361
<i>And the file?</i>

595
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,242
<i>Does he have it?</i>

596
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,037
<i>I need that file, Alik.</i>

597
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,742
He's taking us to it.

598
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,580
<i>No more mistakes, Alik.</i>

599
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,874
<i>And when you have the file...</i>

600
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,414
<i>...kill them both.</i>

601
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,000
Yes, sir.

602
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,352
Shit.

603
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,201
That was exciting.

604
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,863
Yeah. Loads of fun.

605
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:32,040
You wanna go again?

606
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:36,374
Are you shot?

607
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:37,537
No.

608
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:39,210
No, I'm fine.

609
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,587
Let me take a look at that.

610
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,548
It's fine.

611
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,887
Oh, fuck.

612
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:49,300
I can't believe she betrayed
her father for Chagarin.

613
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,890
I don't understand that.

614
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,891
Someday you will.

615
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,146
Kids.

616
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,781
What's our next move?

617
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,568
I don't know.

618
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,908
You don't know?
I don't know, all right?

619
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,160
I mean, I'm out of moves.
I don't know.

620
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,082
I don't know.

621
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,077
I screwed up.

622
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,588
I blew the mission.

623
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:29,257
Well, then we're done, right?

624
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:30,595
Yeah, we're done.

625
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:31,842
We're done.

626
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,262
We should just go home.

627
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:37,022
We'll stop by a little pharmacy
on our way out of Moscow,

628
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,775
get you some Merthiolate
or mercury

629
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,481
and fix up your
little scratches, here.

630
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:45,777
Get you home.
Get a little toy set.

631
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:49,698
Get yourself a nice warm glass of
milk with a little Bosco in it.

632
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,453
Get your CIA slippers.

633
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:52,783
All right.

634
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,619
What?
I get it.

635
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,626
What the hell are we gonna do?

636
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,621
What's in the file?

637
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,336
Evidence on Chagarin.

638
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:08,674
Evidence about what?

639
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:11,807
Chernobyl.

640
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:16,061
Look, listen to me.

641
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,221
Komarov and
Chagarin used to have this

642
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:22,814
nasty little side-racket
going on back in the day.

643
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:28,027
They siphoned weapons-grade
uranium, got greedy,

644
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,071
caused the meltdown.

645
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:35,826
Then, you know, they fell out.

646
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,659
Former partners, bad break-up.

647
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,878
Scumbags.

648
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,748
So, Chagarin had
Komarov thrown in jail.

649
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,589
You know, put him in a hole,
forget about him.

650
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,674
Doesn't have to worry anymore.

651
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,390
So what happened to rescuesque?

652
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,180
Well, he grew a conscience.

653
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:00,681
Yeah, well, that figures.

654
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:05,068
Listen, Chagarin is bad news.
All right he's the real deal.

655
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:08,948
If we see this guy in control, we're
gonna see the whole thing fall apart.

656
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:12,280
I'm talking terrorism,

657
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,285
WMD's,

658
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:16,280
nukes.

659
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,586
Someone has to stop him.

660
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,749
Well, that's what we do.

661
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:33,139
We go out to Chiapep
and we do our thing.

662
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,391
Our thing?

663
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,467
Yeah.

664
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:41,271
We go out there
and kill a lot of scumbags.

665
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:50,317
What? You got
something better to do?

666
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,450
All right. Pull it.

667
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,702
You're not gonna cry, are you?

668
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:57,704
Just pull it.

669
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:59,911
Everybody needs a good cry
once in a while, Jack.

670
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,125
Don't be ashamed.
Pull it.

671
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,914
You remember that time when

672
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:08,207
you and Ralphie Mauser were gonna
have that house-painting job?

673
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,813
Got your finger
caught in the ladder,

674
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,210
you cried for
about 5, 6 days.

675
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:12,673
John, just pull it!

676
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,259
All right.

677
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:17,390
On 3. Here you go.

678
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:19,593
1, 2...

679
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:25,770
Good God.

680
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,525
Jesus.

681
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,400
When was the last time
you had a tetanus shot?

682
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,453
You all right?

683
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:39,738
Yeah.

684
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:42,658
We need a car.

685
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:44,827
Atta boy.

686
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,461
Back to work.

687
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,938
Hey, Watergate,
how's that lock coming?

688
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,693
Almost there.

689
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,650
Here, try these.

690
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:15,069
Come on.

691
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:17,655
Oh, stealing. That's nice.
Real nice, John.

692
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:20,492
Yeah, I'm up for the
Father of the Year award.

693
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:33,796
Whoa.

694
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:37,804
All right.

695
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,044
How'd you know all of these
guns were gonna be here?

696
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,133
It's a Chechen hangout.

697
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,052
Owner doesn't like
guns in the club,

698
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,020
so these bozos leave
them in their cars.

699
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,272
You learn a lot in 3 years.

700
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:49,349
Yeah.

701
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:06,875
You sleeping?

702
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:10,875
I was.

703
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,124
Jet-lag.

704
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:24,426
Jeez, when was the last time
we were in a car together?

705
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:29,055
Drive home from Trenton.

706
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:33,102
I had to bail you out for that
weapons charge.

707
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,644
Yeah?

708
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,190
No, it was the fire thing,
right?

709
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:40,196
When you set South Philly
on fire, you mean?

710
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:46,584
We had to take out a second mortgage
on the house to make your bail.

711
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,742
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

712
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:50,919
It was funny.

713
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:05,596
Are we really
going to Chernobyl?

714
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,636
Yeah.

715
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:10,105
The Chernobyl.

716
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,440
The radioactive joint?
Meltdown?

717
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,272
That's the one.

718
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,937
It's not the Chernobyl
in Switzerland, right?

719
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,278
With all the skiing and
the snow and everything?

720
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:23,443
You mean Grenoble?

721
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:27,827
No, sorry,
we're not going to Grenoble.

722
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:37,291
Eddie Collins's kid took
him on vacation last year.

723
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:38,800
They went down to Boca.

724
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:39,959
Oh, yeah?

725
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,286
Spent 4 days at the track.

726
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:43,009
Well, that's nice.

727
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,053
That's relaxing.

728
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:47,718
Oh, yeah. Sure.

729
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:51,146
We have to go to Chernobyl?

730
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,147
Yeah, sorry about that.

731
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,519
But all the radioactive stuff
is out, right?

732
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:34,397
<i>Is it as you remember, papa?</i>

733
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,186
<i>I don't want to remember.</i>

734
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,151
<i>Tough.</i>

735
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:42,480
<i>The file...</i>

736
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,361
<i>...is in the inner vault.</i>

737
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,738
Very touching.
Let's move.

738
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:15,681
Which one is it?

739
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,600
<i>Get moving, old goat.</i>

740
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,763
Couple of fresh coats of paint and
a weedwacker and it's good to go.

741
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:07,782
You know, at first, they
denied anything even happened.

742
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:10,535
Held a children's parade
the next day to prove it.

743
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:15,123
24 hours later, 50,000
residents were evacuated.

744
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,958
Never came back.

745
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:22,835
As soon as they get in that
vault, Komarov's a dead man.

746
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,005
All right.

747
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:19,395
You got a plan?

748
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:21,685
Not really.

749
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:25,018
I kind of thought
we'd just wing it.

750
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:29,735
You know, run in, guns blazing,
making shit up as we go.

751
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:32,109
Yeah?
Yeah.

752
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,580
What is this? A pirate gun?

753
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:40,242
Yeah. It's old school, man.

754
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:41,534
Like you, right?

755
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,578
Yeah, like me.

756
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:49,383
One of these days, I'm gonna
have a long talk with you.

757
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,647
Look, Jack,

758
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,901
I'm sorry your
partner got killed.

759
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:16,904
I'm sorry I fucked up your day.
That wasn't my plan.

760
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,239
I caused you problems.

761
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:23,785
You know, I came here
for something else.

762
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,584
And all that other bullshit.
I mean,

763
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:36,135
I had a pretty good day.

764
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:41,470
It's fun,
running around with you.

765
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,106
It's good to see you.

766
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,614
I love you, boy.

767
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:04,792
You, too.

768
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,209
I want you to know
I got your back.

769
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,877
I got yours, too.

770
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:22,643
All right. Let's go kill
some motherfuckers.

771
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:44,991
<i>Key.</i>

772
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:18,551
Okay, what the fuck is this?

773
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:22,422
I'm losing my patience. The
fucking file better be here.

774
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:29,687
Radiation has been
pooling in this room for decades.

775
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:34,776
You've underestimated
us, Daddy dearest.

776
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,228
<i>Bring it in!</i>

777
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:32,325
Atta boy.

778
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:38,839
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

779
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:44,964
Compound 27-4. It
neutralizes radiation, trust me.

780
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:28,098
All clear.
We can ditch the suits.

781
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:08,345
The hell is that?

782
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:13,719
1 billion euros worth
of enriched uranium.

783
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:16,763
What?

784
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:21,021
Don't worry,
it's stable in this form.

785
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,147
File!

786
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:27,991
Irina, cut the crap, please.

787
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:31,866
No one here is speaking about uranium.
Where's the file?

788
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,414
No more games,
where is the file?

789
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:43,714
That's no longer your concern.

790
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:09,573
<i>Sunshine...</i>

791
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:11,488
<i>...you did well.</i>

792
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:16,579
<i>I told you...</i>

793
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:18,524
<i>...everything would work out.</i>

794
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:22,536
<i>Come to papa.</i>

795
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:37,434
Papa, You're a genius.

796
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:39,603
<i>I know.</i>

797
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:45,563
<i>Load it up.</i>

798
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:49,439
<i>Pegasus?</i>

799
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:51,232
<i>Do you copy?</i>

800
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:42,492
A lot of hardware for a file.

801
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:53,044
<i>Wheels up in 5 minutes.</i>

802
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:54,629
<i>Perfect.</i>

803
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:37,004
<i>Here you go, sir.</i>

804
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:39,340
<i>Team extraction completed. She's all yours.</i>

805
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:40,340
<i>Good...</i>

806
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:12,214
<i>Are you inside?</i>

807
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:13,673
<i>Yes, yes, Viktor.</i>

808
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:17,337
<i>I'm inside.</i>

809
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:21,261
<i>Yuri?</i>

810
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:23,683
<i>You surprised?</i>

811
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,434
<i>I'm in the same place where it all started...</i>

812
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:30,941
<i>...before you betrayed me.</i>

813
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:32,601
<i>Remember...</i>

814
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:37,064
<i>...you promised to give me my life back.</i>

815
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:39,574
<i>You gave it back to me.</i>

816
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,282
<i>I thank you for that.</i>

817
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:46,035
<i>And now...</i>

818
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,083
<i>...I'm going to take yours.</i>

819
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:19,865
<i>Static 4, we are ready for take off.</i>

820
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:24,411
<i>Static 4, do you copy?</i>

821
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:31,043
Yuri!

822
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:36,127
Yuri.

823
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:38,463
Where's the dancer?

824
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:41,261
You okay? You hurt?

825
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:42,922
No.

826
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:46,800
I'm good.

827
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,098
I'm all right.

828
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:59,233
What's in these boxes?

829
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:04,239
Thank God you're here, Jack.

830
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:06,787
We have to leave.

831
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:08,448
They're coming back any minute.

832
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:13,661
Just let me get the file.

833
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:15,499
What's in the boxes?

834
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:21,252
It's U-235.

835
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:25,347
Weapons-grade uranium.

836
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:29,301
Armored cases.

837
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:36,350
The bomb kind?

838
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,487
Yeah, the bomb kind.

839
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:47,786
Not so fast, Eddie.

840
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:49,158
Are you crazy?

841
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:51,657
Yeah, a little bit.

842
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:53,167
I'm getting the file.

843
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:57,337
No. No, you're not.

844
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:01,292
The key. It's your
vault, isn't it, Yuri?

845
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:04,507
What? No. No, I...

846
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:06,635
You put this
shit in here, right?

847
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:07,798
What? No.

848
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:08,924
Right?

849
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:11,348
I didn't know, Jack.

850
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:21,942
Is that the dancer down there?

851
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:23,689
What are you talking about?

852
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:25,774
That's a tough break
for a good athlete.

853
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:28,991
Jack, you know me.

854
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:33,957
Yeah, I know you. I know you.

855
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:37,290
I know him better.

856
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:43,710
Never was a file,
was there, Yuri?

857
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:54,853
Of course there was no file.

858
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,389
It was simply bait.

859
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:00,976
What I needed
was in this vault.

860
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:03,020
Chagarin was
the only one with enough

861
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:04,980
power and influence
to get me out of jail.

862
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:08,321
I used him.

863
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:11,820
I used you.

864
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:16,417
It's about money.

865
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:18,335
When's it not about money?

866
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:19,746
You want to arrest me?

867
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:26,510
You're out of your jurisdiction,
Detective McClane, aren't you?

868
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:29,259
I wouldn't worry too much
about being arrested.

869
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:32,223
See, my boy

870
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:34,927
is in the CIA.

871
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:37,347
No phone call.

872
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:39,606
Spy shit.

873
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:44,361
Goddamn Americans.
You think you're so smart.

874
01:23:45,062 --> 01:23:48,692
No, I'm not that smart.
I'm just on vacation.

875
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:50,530
My boy here.

876
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:53,537
He gonna put a whooping on you.

877
01:23:59,076 --> 01:24:01,249
Move!

878
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:11,597
You can say goodbye to your
daughter, you dumbwit fuck.

879
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:19,229
Where's your
little Soltschanitsa?

880
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:34,324
Shit!
God damn it!

881
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:40,325
Shit!

882
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:05,256
<i>Irina, I'm going to the roof...</i>

883
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:06,185
<i>The roof!</i>

884
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:10,651
Jack!

885
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:29,883
<i>Set at 91.</i>

886
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:30,918
<i>Power plant?</i>

887
01:25:31,251 --> 01:25:32,093
<i>All good to go.</i>

888
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:32,711
<i>Let's go!</i>

889
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:04,117
Subtle.

890
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:06,913
What the hell is in
those goddamn grenades?

891
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:15,087
Go get him!

892
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:17,765
I'm going to the helicopter!

893
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:14,146
<i>Vadim, watch the tail.</i>

894
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:16,314
<i>Copy. You are at 120 meters...</i>

895
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:18,150
<i>...115 meters...</i>

896
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:47,268
<i>There is small arms fire coming from the roof.</i>

897
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:02,166
We have a guest.

898
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:05,034
<i>Hatch the tail for me there.</i>

899
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:13,706
<i>Come on!</i>

900
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:15,082
<i>Come on, hurry!</i>

901
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:17,714
<i>Vadim, give me firing control now...</i>

902
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:19,211
<i>Engaging!</i>

903
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:26,468
Jack!

904
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:30,142
<i>Shoot him!</i>

905
01:28:30,597 --> 01:28:31,564
<i>With pleasure, papa.</i>

906
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:40,319
I'm on fucking vacation!

907
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:44,452
<i>Vadim! He is there! I see him!</i>

908
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:54,171
The shit we do for our kids.

909
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:56,331
Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker.

910
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:01,928
<i>What happened?</i>

911
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:12,272
<i>CG's shifted...</i>

912
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:14,516
<i>I've got full forward cyclic.</i>

913
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:47,007
<i>I can't hold it.</i>

914
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:50,973
Jesus Christ!

915
01:29:56,683 --> 01:29:57,684
Well done,

916
01:29:58,310 --> 01:29:59,903
Mr. Super-spy.

917
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:06,493
What a shame your father won't
be alive to see you promoted.

918
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:09,404
Neither will you.

919
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,630
Hey! Jack!

920
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,717
Hang on, John!

921
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:09,597
John!

922
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:16,680
Come on!

923
01:31:25,355 --> 01:31:26,698
<i>We're out of ammunition!</i>

924
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:28,108
<i>Shit.</i>

925
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:29,985
<i>Bastards.</i>

926
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,237
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

927
01:31:35,115 --> 01:31:35,995
<i>This is for you, papa.</i>

928
01:32:40,013 --> 01:32:41,014
John!

929
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:44,809
John!

930
01:32:46,352 --> 01:32:47,353
John!

931
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:55,987
John!

932
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:02,081
Dad!

933
01:33:04,454 --> 01:33:05,455
Right here.

934
01:33:32,774 --> 01:33:34,367
Did you just call me Dad?

935
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:37,195
No.

936
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:40,206
I didn't think so.

937
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:43,535
You're hearing things.

938
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:47,213
You got swimmer's ear.

939
01:33:56,256 --> 01:33:59,260
We're not gonna grow any third
arms or anything, are we?

940
01:33:59,425 --> 01:34:00,597
No.

941
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:02,804
You might lose your hair.

942
01:34:03,429 --> 01:34:04,555
Laugh it up, kid.

943
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:07,726
This is you,
5 years from now.

944
01:34:08,226 --> 01:34:10,228
It's rainwater.
You'll be fine.

945
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:13,569
Besides, it's hard
to kill a McClane.

946
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:16,943
Now you're a McClane?

947
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:20,410
Yeah, I'm a McClane.
John McClane.

948
01:34:20,572 --> 01:34:22,074
John McClane Junior.

949
01:34:23,074 --> 01:34:25,543
Well, that makes you a "senior."

950
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:27,204
That's right.

951
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:28,917
Try not to forget it.

952
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,753
I'm your father.

953
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:34,924
Have some respect
for your father.

954
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,092
Let me ask you something.

955
01:34:39,132 --> 01:34:41,260
Do you go looking for trouble

956
01:34:41,426 --> 01:34:43,554
or does it always
just seem to find you?

957
01:34:45,638 --> 01:34:48,608
You know,
after all these years,

958
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:52,228
I still ask myself
the same question.

959
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:35,356
<i>I had a dream last night
That I was piloting a plane</i>

960
01:35:35,521 --> 01:35:39,025
<i>And all the passengers
were drunk and insane</i>

961
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:42,370
<i>I crash landed
in a Louisiana swamp</i>

962
01:35:42,445 --> 01:35:45,995
<i>Shot up a horde of zombies
But I come out on top</i>

963
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:48,202
<i>What's it all about?</i>

964
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:51,626
<i>Guess it just reflects my mood</i>

965
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:57,256
<i>Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt</i>

966
01:35:57,335 --> 01:36:02,842
<i>All I hear is doom and gloom</i>

967
01:36:04,342 --> 01:36:08,597
<i>And all is darkness</i>

968
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,808
<i>In my room</i>

969
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:17,356
<i>Through the light,
your face I see</i>

970
01:36:19,065 --> 01:36:24,117
<i>Baby, take a chance Baby,
won't you dance with me</i>

971
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:29,701
<i>Lost all that treasure
in an overseas war</i>

972
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:33,630
<i>It just goes to show you
don't get what you paid for</i>

973
01:36:33,746 --> 01:36:37,125
<i>Battle to the rich
and you worry about the poor</i>

974
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:41,088
<i>Put my feet up on the couch
And lock all the doors</i>

975
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:42,547
<i>What's that funky noise?</i>

976
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,601
<i>It's the tightening
of the screws</i>

977
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:51,769
<i>Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt</i>

978
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:57,355
<i>All I hear is doom and gloom</i>

979
01:36:59,355 --> 01:37:02,199
<i>But when those drums</i>

980
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:05,154
<i>Go boom, boom, boom</i>

981
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:09,536
<i>Through the night</i>

982
01:37:09,615 --> 01:37:13,165
<i>Your face I see</i>

983
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:19,384
<i>Baby, take a chance Baby,
won't you dance with me</i>

984
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:22,670
<i>Yeah!</i>

985
01:37:22,962 --> 01:37:27,308
<i>Baby, won't you dance with me</i>

986
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:29,101
<i>Ah, yeah</i>

987
01:37:49,447 --> 01:37:53,668
<i>Fracking deep for oil But
there's nothing in the sump</i>

988
01:37:53,743 --> 01:37:57,373
<i>There's kids all picking
at the garbage dump</i>

989
01:37:57,455 --> 01:38:01,050
<i>I am running out of water
so I better prime the pump</i>

990
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:05,301
<i>I am trying to stay sober
but I end up drunk</i>

991
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:10,136
<i>We'll be eating dirt Living
on the side of the road</i>

992
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:14,146
<i>There's some food for thought</i>

993
01:38:14,222 --> 01:38:17,977
<i>Kind of makes your head explode</i>

994
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:21,445
<i>Feeling kind of hurt</i>

995
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:23,277
<i>Yeah!</i>

996
01:38:23,356 --> 01:38:26,360
<i>But all I hear</i>

997
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:29,283
<i>Is doom and gloom</i>

998
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:34,751
<i>And all is darkness</i>

999
01:38:34,826 --> 01:38:37,170
<i>In my room</i>

1000
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:40,832
<i>Through the night</i>

1001
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:44,135
<i>Your face I see</i>

1002
01:38:45,461 --> 01:38:47,714
<i>Baby, take a chance</i>

1003
01:38:48,297 --> 01:38:51,517
<i>Won't you dance with me</i>

1004
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:53,223
<i>Yeah!</i>

1005
01:38:53,594 --> 01:38:54,595
<i>Come on!</i>

1006
01:38:55,096 --> 01:38:57,849
<i>Baby, won't you dance with me</i>

1007
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:01,778
<i>I'm feeling kind of hurt</i>

1008
01:39:01,853 --> 01:39:04,857
<i>Baby, won't you dance with me</i>

1009
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:07,324
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

1010
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,118
<i>Sitting in the dirt</i>

1011
01:39:09,193 --> 01:39:13,198
<i>Baby, won't you dance with me</i>
