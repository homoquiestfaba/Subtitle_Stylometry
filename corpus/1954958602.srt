1
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,181
Fuck, yeah!

2
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:47,256
This is such a big night for you.

3
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,855
but I'm celebrating.

4
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,195
I finally just slept
with my high-school crush.

5
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,255
Right?

6
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:56,392
Thank you.

7
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,596
Thank you, but I swear, now he, like,

8
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,765
expects me to go to his graduation.

9
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,102
Like I know where I'm gonna
be in three years, right?

10
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,443
I'm like, "Whoa!"

11
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,676
Slow it down.

12
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,445
Fucking kids, right?

13
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:18,149
Fucking small kids.

14
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,714
You look, like, upset.
Like, I don't fuck kids.

15
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,781
That's a joke.

16
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,351
Like, I would never...

17
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,953
I shouldn't say never.

18
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,794
That's like... you don't know...

19
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,732
I feel like I just painted
myself in a corner there.

20
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,669
But... that's not a good way to start.

21
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,069
This is a beautiful theater.

22
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,198
I should be really grateful.

23
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,208
I worked at a fish restaurant last week.

24
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,039
Like, I did stand-up
at a fish restaurant,

25
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,669
just so you guys know.

26
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,701
That's not a joke.

27
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:42,906
People were, like, eating mussels,

28
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,381
and they were just like, "Check".

29
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,180
And I was like, "Can you just
let me try and pursue my dream?"

30
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,778
And this place is so beautiful.

31
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,982
I should have started off

32
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,217
with something other than kid fucking.

33
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,954
You guys are right.

34
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,155
Start over. Class it up.

35
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,824
My mom's a cunt. Hear me out.

36
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,663
Go with me on this, you guys.

37
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:09,037
I know, like, not everyone's
comfortable with that word.

38
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,803
Half of you were like, "Ugh," right?

39
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,070
"No, don't say that".

40
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,600
And the other half of you
were like, "Oh, my God.

41
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,079
What a coincidence".

42
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:22,551
"That cunt should meet my cunt mom".

43
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,415
I just... I brought her to a soccer game

44
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,892
'cause I wanted her to see
what boundaries looked like,

45
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,327
you know?

46
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,457
I was like, "Look,
stop wearing my clothes".

47
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,761
Ugh.

48
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,325
She's always bragging
about the dumbest stuff.

49
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,598
The other day she was telling
me, she was like,

50
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,266
"You know, I can still fit
in my wedding dress,"

51
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:46,437
I was like, "Oh, my God.
Who cares?" Right?

52
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,472
I mean, it is weird
that she's the same size now

53
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,244
as she was when she
was eight months pregnant,

54
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,343
but I just...

55
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,817
I don't think bragging's cool.

56
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:02,883
Are you okay?

57
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,486
You're, like, choking. No?

58
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,622
Are you allergic to talent?

59
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,225
Hi. Hi.

60
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,930
I'm just kidding. Are you okay, really?

61
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,996
You need anything? Okay.

62
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,167
Oh, God.

63
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,874
I don't need
another death under my belt.

64
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,437
Speaking of me taking
Plan "B" last week,

65
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,813
I...

66
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:26,839
I did.

67
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,318
You know... you know what it is?

68
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,185
There are some people here...
it's the morning-after pill.

69
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,623
I take it the night before
'cause I'm smart.

70
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,648
But...

71
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,561
some people like to...
I'm with you good people.

72
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,826
I believe birth begins at conception.

73
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,662
So I just, like, beat that shit.

74
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,665
Plan Bizzle.

75
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,540
Who's taken it? Who's taken it?

76
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,703
Thank you.

77
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,235
Oh, sorry, a room of heroes.

78
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,474
Everyone's like,

79
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,641
"Eh"

80
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,083
This place is old. There's probably...

81
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,347
you're probably being inseminated

82
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,322
by the seats right now, let's be real.

83
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,825
I did, I took it.

84
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:08,951
It's over the...

85
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,428
I went to my normal pharmacy. I walk in.

86
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,294
The pharmacist is like, "Hey, Ame".

87
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,129
I'm like, "Please
don't call me a nickname".

88
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,930
He's like, "What do you want, Ambien?"

89
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,766
I'm like, "No, I'm not addicted to that.

90
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:23,103
"You guys know that.

91
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,972
I only take that when I'm drinking".

92
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,574
They're like, "What do you want?"

93
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,376
I was like, "Plan and they were like...

94
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,404
they didn't even hide it.

95
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,747
They were like, "Ew, you whore".

96
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,309
I was like,

97
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:39,721
"You can't... you can't say that".

98
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,521
They're like,
"You're gonna feel nauseous".

99
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,582
I was like, "Ugh".

100
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,256
I took it, I felt fine.

101
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,324
I went to yoga.

102
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,993
I'm like, "Can these people tell

103
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,867
"I'm, like, mid-aborsh right now?

104
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:53,996
This is..."

105
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,878
This is not good. It was easy.

106
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:07,976
They should call it Plan
That's how I used it.

107
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,783
It's a great plan.
Let's start with this one.

108
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,848
I... I don't...

109
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,915
I don't think that's, like,

110
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,984
adorable that I just took Plan

111
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,428
I'm 31. Like, that's not cute at all.

112
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,661
That's cute when you're, like...
you're, like, 21, right?

113
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,327
You go, you sit on your mom's bed,

114
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,597
you cry, you're like,

115
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,629
"Oh, the condom broke".

116
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,141
I'm like, "The what broke?"

117
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,278
"What now? What's this you speak of?"

118
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:40,443
I do, I still think I'm
20. It's so gross.

119
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,510
Like, every bar I go to, I show my I.D.

120
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,614
They're like, "No, that's okay".

121
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:49,525
Like, "Wow, they're really relaxed here.

122
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,722
"I hope they don't get raided.

123
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,459
This place, I don't know".

124
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,761
But the girls I grew up with,

125
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,665
they're living normal
adult lives, you know?

126
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,227
So they call me now, and they're
like, "Ame, I'm pregnant".

127
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,899
And I still react like,
"What are you gonna do?"

128
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,643
"No..."

129
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:11,046
I'm like, "I'll drive you, I guess".

130
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,779
They're like, "No, you're gross,"

131
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:18,755
I'm like, "Oh, we keep them now".

132
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,883
Keep them.

133
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,122
That's my favorite reality show.

134
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,458
You know the show Teen Mom?

135
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,556
Or if you're from the South, Mom.

136
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,334
They don't wait, right?

137
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,895
This is poor planning on my part.

138
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,338
I'm kind of dizzy.

139
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,898
I donated blood today.

140
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,606
That's what I call getting an AIDS test.

141
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:43,841
I know, that j...

142
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,783
people, like, hate
that joke if they have AIDS.

143
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:53,886
So if you didn't laugh, get tested.

144
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,621
Check it out.

145
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,855
Check it out.

146
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,330
You have it. You have it.

147
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,027
I'm a healer.

148
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,335
I went through a breakup this year.

149
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,431
I was dating this guy.

150
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,908
I walked in on him masturbating.

151
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,774
Yeah, he's like, "Are you mad?"

152
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,746
I'm like, "No, but you seem to be.

153
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,009
Holy shit".

154
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,813
I'm like, "Does it owe you money?

155
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,483
"Why are you..."

156
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,656
"Is that waterboarding?

157
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,061
I don't feel safe".

158
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,364
Me and this guy, we were so different.

159
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,529
I knew we were... like, he
was, like, really into family.

160
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:43,598
You know, and I mentioned my mom.

161
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,939
Like, he'd never come on
the road with me on the weekends

162
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,571
'cause he wanted to spend
time with his wife.

163
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,376
And I just...

164
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,576
I'm better.

165
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:54,946
No, the truth is

166
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,009
I thought he was gonna break up with me

167
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,851
the whole time for the lamest reason...

168
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,289
because I wouldn't swallow.

169
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,522
But I have a nut allergy.
Like, what did he expect?

170
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm gonna risk my life...

171
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,100
for his empty calories?

172
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,232
No!

173
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,171
Stop telling us it's good for our skin.

174
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,647
Fuck you guys.

175
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,885
One girl was like, "Oh, okay".

176
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,986
Guys are so gross, right?

177
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,189
Guys are gross.

178
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,391
You're gross, okay?

179
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,558
They're so gross.

180
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,363
I had sex with a guy recently,

181
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,860
more semen than you've
ever seen in your life.

182
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,465
I was like, "Did you
just get out of jail?

183
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:55,275
What's... what is the meaning of this?"

184
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,371
"It's a compliment".

185
00:08:56,402 --> 00:09:00,111
"No, no".

186
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,380
But that's what guys want
'cause they're so gross.

187
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,149
If it were up to them,
we'd all look like Carrie

188
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,019
in the prom scene at the end, just,

189
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,252
"Ugh"

190
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,330
No girl wants that. We don't want that.

191
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,831
We're lazier than you.

192
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,026
If it were up to me,

193
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,295
the cleanup would be me taking a Q-tip

194
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,825
going, boop, asleep.

195
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,496
That's it.

196
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:24,235
Instead I was like, "I've been slimed".

197
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,774
"I feel like a contestant
on Double Dare right now".

198
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:41,619
"Let me just get this
self-worth off me real quick".

199
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,052
That's why I don't like porn.

200
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,154
Well, I like to watch porn.

201
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,823
Like, what girls in here like porn?

202
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,162
Thank you. I love it.

203
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,930
All the... all the whores
are in the front.

204
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,938
This is the best.

205
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,633
Girls in the back are, like,

206
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,608
reading books.

207
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:02,135
They're like, "50 shades of what?"

208
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,943
That reference will not be funny

209
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,381
by the time this show comes out.

210
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,611
People will be like, "What a hack.

211
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,641
Oh, God".

212
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,950
More references about right now,

213
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,389
how about Sandusky... no.

214
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,760
Wasting everyone's time
in the editing room.

215
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,627
So, yeah, I like porn.

216
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,827
I like that casting director
one, that's funny.

217
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,269
He never finds the right girl.

218
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,364
What do these girls have to do?

219
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,238
I don't like to watch the end of porn.

220
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,140
I don't like to
watch the end of any porn,

221
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,702
'cause guess what happens
at the end of the rainbow

222
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,339
every time.

223
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,646
Spoiler alert, he cums on her face.

224
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:40,742
Oh!

225
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:45,654
What an amazing
choose-your-own adventure

226
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,488
that always ends exactly the same.

227
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,926
There's never a twist, right?

228
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,361
He's never like... the guy
is having sex with her,

229
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,058
and he looks off camera
in her backpack, he's like,

230
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:57,966
"Oh, are you reading that
Nicholas Sparks book too?"

231
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,663
"Oh, my God. What are the chances?

232
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,572
Let's start a bed
and breakfast together".

233
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,598
No.

234
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,237
He just cums on her head.

235
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,113
We don't wanna see that. I don't want...

236
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,550
'cause we think about that girl.

237
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,018
Like, that poor girl,

238
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,750
and we know, as soon as
the director yells "cut,"

239
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,849
that she's just
stumbling around like Helen Keller

240
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,656
looking for a towel, just where...

241
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:27,756
"Did you guys go to lunch?

242
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:32,099
"This isn't cool.

243
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,401
You promise this is good for my skin?"

244
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,674
That's so funny.

245
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,181
Am I the only person who ever
walked in the audience

246
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,876
during their special?

247
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,885
Three little Asian chicks
were just like...

248
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,358
And that's not racist, that's just...

249
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,827
I'm just saying that that's
how all Asian people walk.

250
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,295
Just very creepy.

251
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,356
I know I'm in San Fran.
I should watch my back.

252
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,299
But...

253
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,896
I think I could take those girls.

254
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,406
That was funny. I was watching them.

255
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,533
Like, every time I referenced
semen, they were just like,

256
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,044
"Oh, no".

257
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,444
Yes.

258
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,215
It's not for shock value.
This happens, right?

259
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,720
Come on, you guys,

260
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,019
we've all taken a load
somewhere we're not proud of.

261
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,251
So...

262
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,485
Like, my mom's here.

263
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,597
So the guy I was dating,
he was, like, so lazy.

264
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,571
He was one of those dudes,
like, he wouldn't go down on me.

265
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,939
I had to become a climber
every time, you know?

266
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,171
Head up there, just holding
on to the headboard

267
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,772
like a nosy neighbor
peeking over the fence.

268
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,714
I feel like Wilson
from Home Improvement.

269
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:57,278
I'm like, "Hey, Tool Man, what's..."

270
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,250
That was embarrassing up there.

271
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,952
That's the worst dismount in the biz.

272
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,451
I don't care how you slice it.

273
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:06,963
So I'm, like, single now. I'm dating.

274
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,431
I suck at dating.

275
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,797
I go outwith these guys.

276
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,802
This guy wanted to go dancing
the other night.

277
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,929
Like, have you ever had a guy
who's trying to date you

278
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,063
be like, "Let's dance"?

279
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,334
It's like, "I don't know".

280
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,773
I'm like, "It's..."

281
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,539
I'm like, "Look, I think you
wanna go to the parade".

282
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,781
And it's also 'cause
I'm the worst dancer.

283
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,547
I dance like your...
like your aunt at a wedding.

284
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,520
Like, every move I do,
I'm surprising myself.

285
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,544
I'm just like,

286
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,751
"Oh, wh... what?

287
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,418
"Whoa, whoa.

288
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,088
Nobody saw it going this way".

289
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,427
Everybody saw it going that way.

290
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,128
It's so awful. So I'm, like, dating now.

291
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,159
I'm, like, going on dates.

292
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,298
Whenever I start seeing someone,

293
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,171
I'm, like, this alternate
version of myself.

294
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,733
It's just like... I'm just, like,

295
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,245
you know, trying to be
super-cool new girl.

296
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,575
I'm like, "Let me just sweep
this crazy under the rug

297
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,013
"for a couple months.

298
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,210
"You don't need to...
you don't need to see this

299
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,083
till month three".

300
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,088
I went on a date with a guy recently,

301
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,646
and he was, like, really hot.

302
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,683
So I was pretending to be
a good person, you know?

303
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:10,853
I was saying things like,

304
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,159
"I love kids, and I'm not racist".

305
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,633
Just vague lies.

306
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,037
And you have to, like, pretend
like you wanna use a condom.

307
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,972
I like to say something fun
when I bring it up, but honest.

308
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,599
I'll be like, "You're
gonna wanna wear this.

309
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,303
I've had a busy month".

310
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,548
"It's like a Petri dish right now.

311
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,985
I don't know what's happening".

312
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,484
People are so upset
about my vagina right now.

313
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:42,514
They're like, "No!"

314
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,118
Here... but this guy, we went out,

315
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,253
and he was like...

316
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,456
you can tell when a guy dates a lot.

317
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,260
He had, like, date questions.

318
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,233
He was like, "if you could
have lunch with anybody,

319
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,463
living or dead, who would it be?"

320
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,492
I thought about it.

321
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,663
I answered honestly, I was like,

322
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,434
"Mark Twain. I think he was hilarious".

323
00:14:56,462 --> 00:15:01,207
And he goes, "Pfft, Amy,
it's got to be somebody real".

324
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,275
I was like, "Oh, you're legit retarded.

325
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,114
That's so cute".

326
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:13,515
"I'm gonna sleep
with a retarded person".

327
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,547
I did.

328
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,289
So I've been on the road a lot lately,

329
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,993
and every town I go to,
you have to do, like,

330
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,592
local press, you know?

331
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,603
<i>The, like, Greenville Who Gives A Shit.</i>

332
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,332
Like, everybody has a paper.

333
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,500
And they all ask the same
questions every week.

334
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,668
They ask me the same, exact question.

335
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,109
They're just like,

336
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,512
"What's the hardest part
about being a female comedian?

337
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,914
What is it? What's the hardest part?"

338
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,418
And, like, what would you guess?

339
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,349
Well, it's the rape.

340
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,862
The three Asian chicks
just walked back in here,

341
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,733
and I said that, and they went...

342
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,501
No, but it is. It's all the rapings.

343
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,010
No... but they ask...
they're just like...

344
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,136
and I guess it's a normal question,

345
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,475
"Is it harder for female comics?

346
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,673
Is it harder?"

347
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:11,704
And it's not.

348
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,216
Like, they think we just get up here

349
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,649
and just bleed all over the stage.

350
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,675
I'm just, "Oh, my ovaries.

351
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,588
How do I keep them in my body?"

352
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,352
Like, it's totally not harder.

353
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,521
It's harder to be a chick
in general, for sure.

354
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,827
That sucks. That's not fun.

355
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,628
Right? Right girls?

356
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,100
No, it is. It sucks.

357
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,466
Just in terms of laziness.

358
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,528
Like, look at the guys
you're here with tonight, okay?

359
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,301
Some of them bangable, not all of them.

360
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,864
Let's be real.

361
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:41,400
Let's keep it honest, okay?

362
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,505
But, like, what did you do
to get ready, you know?

363
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,516
Like, how long did it
take you to get ready?

364
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,781
You didn't get ready is the answer.

365
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,584
Guys don't do shit.

366
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,885
They put a shirt on,

367
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,324
give themselves one of these
in the mirror, they're out.

368
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,057
They're like, "I did it, bro.

369
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,122
I fucking did it".

370
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,532
"What did you do?"

371
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,963
Some guys take a little more time.

372
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,802
I dated a guy from Philly for a while.

373
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,171
Is anybody here from Philadelphia?

374
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,197
Yeah?

375
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,268
Okay, some sassy babes.

376
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,334
No dudes, though.

377
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,641
But tell me if I'm right about this.

378
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,672
Well, just agree, 'cause
this is for my TV special.

379
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,951
Like, those dudes will beat you to death

380
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,286
with a sack of batteries,

381
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,348
but they get their eyebrows waxed.

382
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,553
You know the kind of guy
I'm talking about?

383
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,859
I was at a Met game... thank you.

384
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,992
And... it was Mets, Phillies,

385
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,024
and I'm sitting behind third base.

386
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,301
And these huge Philly meatheads
are heckling David Wright.

387
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,238
They're like, "You suck,
Wright. You're the worst.

388
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,435
We hate you".

389
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,877
And so I said,
"You're very attractive!"

390
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,542
And the biggest one
of them goes, "True".

391
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,424
But most guys don't do shit.

392
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,154
Like, look at the shirts
you guys are wearing.

393
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,593
Every one of you that I can see,

394
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,993
you could have worn that
when you were a toddler

395
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,019
on picture day.

396
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,123
Every one. No difference.

397
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,395
Check it out.

398
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,425
But look at the
beautiful girls you're with.

399
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,268
Look at... it's so much work for us.

400
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,207
It takes me 90 minutes
to look this mediocre.

401
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,404
90 minutes.

402
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,777
Tonight it took eight hours, okay?

403
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,611
I slept sitting up. I slept like this.

404
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,275
It's so much work.

405
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,183
Oh, we're like clowns.

406
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,347
We are circus freaks, women, we are.

407
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:35,347
We... we put paint on
our faces like warriors.

408
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,984
We're... I'm wearing stilts.

409
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,017
We wear stilts. We wear heels all night.

410
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,031
And we put a string
in our buttholes, just...

411
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,732
"Ah...

412
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,431
am I pretty?"

413
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,371
We wear jewelry, shiny shit...

414
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,999
"Look over here.
Follow me to the altar".

415
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,713
Ugh.

416
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,980
It sucks. It sucks.

417
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,350
I think as a woman as you get older,

418
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,719
you get lazier just by looking around.

419
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,225
No, I just... I work in Vegas a lot.

420
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,527
That doesn't sound awesome.

421
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,533
But I do stand-up in Vegas a lot,

422
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,728
and I see these packs of young girls

423
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,759
that still have the energy, you know?

424
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:21,793
Just a pack of girls

425
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,932
all wearing tube dresses, right?

426
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,942
And just... the heels they can't handle.

427
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:29,173
They have to hold each other
and do, like, Wizard of Oz walk,

428
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,910
chain gang kind of...

429
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,349
They all look identical.

430
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,375
It looks like a whore computer
just shot out a prototype,

431
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:37,648
and they just started walking.

432
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,654
"Tonight, tonight's
the night, you guys".

433
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,095
I like seeing them
at the end of the night,

434
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,291
you know, like it didn't work out.

435
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,698
They're carrying their heels.

436
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,360
They're crying their makeup off.

437
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,631
It looks like they're melting.

438
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,195
"Why didn't anyone pick me?"

439
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,203
"You have puke on your tube, Amber".

440
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,113
It's all work.

441
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,049
It's work having a vagina. That's work.

442
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,849
Guys don't think
that it's work, but it is.

443
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,685
You think it just shows up
like that to the event?

444
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,351
It doesn't.

445
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,688
Every night it's like getting it ready

446
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,128
for its first quinceañera, believe me.

447
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,459
Gets an updo, it cries.

448
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,798
It's a lot of work.

449
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,361
It didn't used to be work.

450
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,100
I know that from watching vintage porn.

451
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:33,234
It was no work.

452
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,869
Zero.

453
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,574
I even... I remember my mom
bottomless when I was a kid.

454
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:38,604
And it was just...

455
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,584
poof!

456
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,746
It looked like the black
smoke monster from Lost

457
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,379
was just following her.

458
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,459
It's like, "Is Mom being
swarmed by bees?

459
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:53,929
"What is...

460
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,364
"Is that a tumbleweed?

461
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,959
We're not even in the West".

462
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,831
And then something happened.
I don't know.

463
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,499
Like, 10, 15 years ago,

464
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,066
all the dudes got together
and had, like, a meeting.

465
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,911
Like a fantasy football
draft about our privates.

466
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,574
They were like, "We can't get in there.

467
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,642
"It's like Vietnam trying to...

468
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,120
What do we do?"

469
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,816
And then they just came to
us, and they were just like,

470
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:23,452
"Ladies, would you mind

471
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,929
looking like babies again?"

472
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,424
And we were like...

473
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,561
"Like, what do you mean?

474
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:37,267
Just clean up the sides
a little bit or..."

475
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,300
"The whole enchilada".

476
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:44,781
And we were like,
"Yeah, that's not super weird".

477
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,215
So now we go, we get it done.

478
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,014
We have to go get it done.

479
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,520
Ugh, yeah, like, that does... she...

480
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:51,714
we go and get it done, guys.

481
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:52,881
Like, it doesn't just happen.

482
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,254
I don't care how cool your girl is.

483
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,316
She doesn't have, like,
alopecia of the crotch.

484
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,727
It just falls out in
the shape of your initials.

485
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,890
That's not what happens.

486
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,466
That's not how it goes down, no.

487
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,266
We get it done.

488
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,772
We have to go see a woman,

489
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:14,266
usually from a third-world country.

490
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,801
It's never from, like...

491
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,313
like, it's never me
that comes and gets you

492
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,644
from the waiting room.

493
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,172
Like, I'll never be like,
"Hi, I'm Ashley.

494
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,411
I'm here to take care of your pussy".

495
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,817
Like, no.

496
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,581
"Pussy!"

497
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,092
No, it's not...

498
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,526
that's not how it goes.

499
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,496
Like, the chick who
does it to me in New York,

500
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,862
I think she's from, like,
the killing fields of Cambodia.

501
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,696
Like, this poor woman...

502
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:41,466
I can tell, like, she has
seen some shit, you know?

503
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,205
She has been through it,

504
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,837
and she was, like, a doctor there.

505
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,838
And now she does this, and she hates me.

506
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,545
And she doesn't even hide it.
I walk in, she's like, "Ugh".

507
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,417
I'm like, "Sorry".

508
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,024
But she should, she should
hate me because I'm like...

509
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,957
we're the worst, white, entitled girls.

510
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,358
I walk in chewing gum,

511
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,384
I'm on my phone.

512
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:08,159
I'm just like...

513
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,427
I'm like, "Don't get any
wax on my new UGGs.

514
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,901
What?"

515
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,238
She's like, "My parents
were murdered in front of me".

516
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,243
I'm like, "I'm on the phone. What?"

517
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,604
"It's about True Blood.
Give me one sec".

518
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,781
She hates me, but she wins.

519
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,878
Like, those chicks win every time,

520
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,479
'cause what they do,
and I always forget this,

521
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,855
they go... she goes and gets a mirror,

522
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,690
and she shows it to me.

523
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:40,890
She shows me my own vagina.

524
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,230
And I have to act
like I'm not horrified.

525
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,000
And I'm horrified.

526
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,938
It's the worst thing in the world.

527
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,964
And what she's saying in that moment is,

528
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:56,571
"Are you happy now, you dumb bitch?

529
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,605
You just paid me to assault you".

530
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,941
"And now you look like a toddler.

531
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:07,081
Is that what... is that cool, yeah?"

532
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,386
And it's not cool.

533
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,450
It's the worst thing
you'll ever see in your life.

534
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,120
It's red.

535
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,322
It looks angry.

536
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,955
It looks like an old man frowning.

537
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,364
Just, "No!"

538
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:23,037
"Visit me!"

539
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,373
"Birds!"

540
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,141
I don't know. Old
people like birds, right?

541
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:31,374
I don't know.

542
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,508
They're always like, "Oh, look, a bird".

543
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:37,247
Ugh. It's so much work.

544
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,487
I think guys have it easier.

545
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:40,956
I'm not sure.

546
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,550
What do you guys think? Yeah, you do?

547
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,960
Did you ever see an
uncircumcised penis?

548
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,895
You did? Did you know...

549
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,262
did you know you were gonna see it?

550
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:52,131
No, it's always a
fucking surprise party, right?

551
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,461
It's a big... it's him, right?

552
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,202
It's him.

553
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,800
Wait. Here's the funniest thing.

554
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,777
I'm sorry that everyone knows
about your penis now.

555
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,302
But here's the best part,

556
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,542
he's wearing a shirt
that says "Browncoats".

557
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,880
Now, if that's not funny...

558
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,176
And that's what it looks like.

559
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:14,383
It looks like your penis is
wearing a little brown coat...

560
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,286
if you've seen one.

561
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,125
You just... nobody ever
tells you, right?

562
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,789
He didn't tell you.
They don't tell you shit.

563
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,890
They're just like, boom,

564
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,299
reunited with Snuffleupagus, enjoy.

565
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,065
Enjoy.

566
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,629
You guys are so cute.

567
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,197
Why don't they tell us?

568
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:32,606
Tell... tell me.

569
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,542
We have to become
award-winning actresses.

570
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:35,772
Like, "Oh, no. That's totally cool.

571
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,110
"Mom, can you come pick me up?

572
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:43,183
"I don't know. It's wearing,
like, a hat or, like, a cape.

573
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,916
Like, a brown coat type thing".

574
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,352
Why don't they tell us?

575
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,025
I would tell you if I had
an extra flap over my clitoris.

576
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,330
I'd give you a heads-up. I would.

577
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,501
I'd be like, "You're gonna
encounter a wizard.

578
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:05,371
"Keep going.

579
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,173
"Go.

580
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,769
Take this compass".

581
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:12,577
I'd make it exciting,

582
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,639
play the music from Zelda.

583
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:14,878
It'd be great.

584
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,514
Men don't care. They don't tell you.

585
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:23,219
I hooked up with a guy one
time that had no testicles.

586
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:28,561
Count them, zero "testicalo".

587
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,861
You think he brought that up at dinner?

588
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:30,889
'Cause he didn't.

589
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,402
I got to find out in real time.

590
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,029
It was dark in the room.

591
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:40,043
Let me paint the romantic picture here.

592
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,274
And I went right to the spot
I know them to always be,

593
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:46,805
no GPS necessary.

594
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,910
I picked up the main event and noth...

595
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,420
I felt like a girl learning Braille.

596
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,013
I just kept...

597
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:57,592
And, like, we don't...

598
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,061
like, girls don't care about your balls.

599
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,358
Like, no one care...

600
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,955
like, I would never call
my sister the morning after

601
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:02,988
and be like,

602
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:06,332
"Hey, okay. So, like, the sex was lame,

603
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,931
"but this guy's balls..."

604
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,606
No.

605
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,412
But when they're
not there, you miss 'em.

606
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,884
They're like grandparents.

607
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:34,959
Thank you.

608
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,364
I like that that's the one
that was too much for you guys.

609
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,959
You're like, "Rape, AIDS, whatevs.

610
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,062
Grandparents? Whoa!"

611
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,535
So, yeah, the way I saw
an uncircumcised penis...

612
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:50,409
I had met this guy
at a bar. He was French.

613
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:51,573
So I should have known,

614
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:52,707
but I didn't know
he was actually French.

615
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:53,875
I thought we were
both just, like, wasted

616
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:55,543
and faking the accent, you know?

617
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:00,889
I was like, "Rosetta Stone!"

618
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,324
'Cause I do, I can
only drink beer and wine now

619
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,554
'cause I, like, my parents are...

620
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,152
anybody have alcoholic parents?

621
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,720
Anybody in here?

622
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,390
Oh, no, everybody was raised awesomely?

623
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:11,823
Like, my dad

624
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,392
used to apologize to me

625
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:17,373
for missing
volleyball games that he was at.

626
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:20,501
So, anyway, I meet
this French guy and...

627
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,978
'cause I don't think that's
a cute accent on dudes, right?

628
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,480
The French accent.

629
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,607
It just... it makes my vagina
shut like a steel trap,

630
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,743
Just pshh!

631
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:31,617
I mean, thank God
for that other hole, but...

632
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:36,615
My butthole.

633
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:37,718
Oh, you knew.

634
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,319
Okay, you knew.

635
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,797
So I went home with this French guy,

636
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,528
'cause he said something adorable like,

637
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,035
"I have an apartment".

638
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,205
I was like, "Oh".

639
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,003
So we go... I go home with him,

640
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,441
and we're, like, making out.

641
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,876
He was very sensual.

642
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,140
He's one of those dudes,
like, he started to pick me up,

643
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:58,772
and then he realized
he was in over his head,

644
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,805
and I got planted back down.

645
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,087
It's hard to feel sexy
when a dudes winded

646
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,351
from trying to hoist you.

647
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:08,982
His, like, legs are shaking.

648
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,015
He's, like, wiping sweat.

649
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,585
I'm like, "Can you just put me..."

650
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,290
I tried to land cute like a gymnast.

651
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,299
I was like...

652
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,232
No, but I do...

653
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,360
but I know I have a body type.

654
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,267
Like, I know, like, I'm not a twig.

655
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,169
Like, if a cheerleading
pyramids being made,

656
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,605
I know I'm a base.

657
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:27,075
Like, I get right down...

658
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,338
I'm not like, "Hoist me up on top

659
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,811
"like a star tonight, you guys.

660
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:30,835
I wanna fly".

661
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,576
Like, I know where I am.

662
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:36,518
I know my body type the way
guys hit on me at bars,

663
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:37,542
like, when it happens.

664
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:38,576
And it's usually my idea.

665
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,680
I'm usually like, "Hey".

666
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:40,712
And they're like, "No, thanks".

667
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:41,746
And I'm like, "Hey!"

668
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,259
And they're like, "Oh".

669
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,663
But when I do get hit on...

670
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,427
Like, this guy just came
up to me, and he was from,

671
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,435
like, Texas or somewhere I'm not going.

672
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:56,166
And...

673
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,571
and he comes over, and he's like,

674
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:00,599
"Hey, I like you.

675
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,873
You're sturdy".

676
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,481
I'm like, "I'm sorry?"

677
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:08,950
He's like, "You look like
you could take a punch".

678
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,975
I'm like, "Oh".

679
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:14,183
Oh, don't I feel like
the belle of the ball.

680
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,789
So I'm making out with Frenchinator,

681
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,525
and... he did...

682
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,964
he put... he, like, gave up right away,

683
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,625
'cause he's French, I guess.

684
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,227
And...

685
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:32,807
Oh, my God. Thank you.

686
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,833
So we're making out, and... he...

687
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,812
he pulled his dick out immediately.

688
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,647
He must have been thinking
like, "She's the one".

689
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,117
And I'm looking at it.

690
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,553
I'm just like, "What... what is that?"

691
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,649
"Are we having, like, a pillow fight?

692
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,125
"What's...

693
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:53,686
Why is the gnome from
Travelocity in your underpants?"

694
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,568
But, like, you can't...
guys are sensitive too.

695
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,297
I couldn't do what I was,
like, thinking, like...

696
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:01,360
"Aah!"

697
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:04,032
Like, run down the
five stories of his walk-up.

698
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,973
I had to be, like, a team
player and be like,

699
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,340
"All right, here we go".

700
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,844
Just, like, fighting through the skin

701
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,312
trying to find his actual pe...

702
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,747
I felt like a magician
with the scarves, I'm just...

703
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:20,314
Waiting for a dove
to hit me in the face.

704
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,819
It sucks getting older as a chick.

705
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,160
In your 20s, you're
just like, "Life is awesome.

706
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:31,724
Everybody wants to fuck me, you guys!"

707
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:33,463
Then you turn 30, and you're like,

708
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,732
"You guys?"

709
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,502
It's like a bus that never comes.

710
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,475
But as I'm getting older,
what I'm doing now

711
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:42,535
is I'm just making sure
I'm the best-looking one

712
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,568
of my friends.

713
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,205
It's really easy.

714
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,877
I cut certain people out of my life.

715
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,377
And I now hand-select
strangers off of Facebook

716
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,016
and surround myself with
real trolls and reptiles.

717
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,151
You should see these monsters.

718
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:59,491
I had a friend, Nikki,
she kept losing weight.

719
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:03,294
I took her out of my phone.
Fuck her, I'm sorry.

720
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,426
But there's one chick
I've been friends with forever.

721
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:06,799
Her name is Sabina.

722
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,394
Like, she's gorgeous,

723
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,133
and of course she is,
with the name Sabina.

724
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,971
Like, what a white,
annoying name, right?

725
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,670
You have to be so hot to
pull off names like that,

726
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,406
like Sabina, Priscilla.

727
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,380
You can't have, like,
a bum knee and a lazy eye

728
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,815
and be like, "I'm Sabina".

729
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,150
It's like, "Nice try.

730
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,347
"We're gonna call you Bertha, bitch.

731
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,788
"But that was cute.

732
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,416
That was cute".

733
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,926
Guys go crazy over her.

734
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,724
I never get hit on like that.

735
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,492
The only time I get hit on
is last call at the bar.

736
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,760
Right?

737
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,632
That's when I shine, I'm telling you.

738
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,136
What a weird time of night, right?

739
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,729
The lights go on.

740
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,639
It just feels real rape-y
all of a sudden.

741
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,108
Post-apocalyptic.

742
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,337
Something happens to the men.

743
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:49,902
They're just like, "I need a woman".

744
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,607
Like, they all just start
pacing like gorillas.

745
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,116
Their eyes widen.

746
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,246
It looks like they can only see by heat.

747
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,315
They're like, "What?" Like Predator.

748
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,154
I see some dude in a full blackout

749
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,323
just walking at me,

750
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,424
like a zombie just pointing
at his own dick.

751
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,298
Like, "Here".

752
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,039
I'm like, "I'll get us a cab".

753
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,005
I know I make it sound
like I'm so slutty up here,

754
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:26,777
but I'm... I've
only been with four people,

755
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,715
and that was a weird night.

756
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,086
That's my business.

757
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,421
Oh, it doesn't matter
what you do, ladies.

758
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,187
Every guy is gonna
leave you for an Asian woman,

759
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,024
and you know that.

760
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,154
That's right,

761
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,892
I'm saying it in San Francisco,
in the hotbed.

762
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,298
In the hotbed.

763
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:48,236
I get it. I can't compete
with an Asian chick.

764
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,761
I can't. They're better.

765
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,273
I've been thinking
about this. I did the math.

766
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,866
I know that's their thing, but I did it.

767
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,604
I've been thinking about
it. I can't win.

768
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,173
How can I compete with an Asian chick?

769
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,616
They're smarter.

770
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,779
They have naturally silky hair.

771
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:08,552
This Jew denial took
me, like, 40 minutes.

772
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,058
They laugh like this

773
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:13,688
'cause they know men
hate when women speak.

774
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,531
They're better.

775
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,535
They're just better.

776
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,764
And how do they bring it
on home for the win?

777
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,967
Oh, the smallest vaginae in the game.

778
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,566
I can't compete with that.

779
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,599
What do I have? What am I...

780
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,442
I've got a B.A. in Theater and HPV.

781
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,915
No one's buying my stock.

782
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,646
I am plummeting.

783
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:37,948
I'm going to black guys.

784
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,420
That's what I'm trying to do.

785
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,821
That's what I'm doing, yeah.

786
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,290
I've... I can't believe
I've never done it.

787
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,919
I'm built for it. It
seems weird I haven't.

788
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,486
Gotta go for the black guy.

789
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,122
Have you ever... black guy? Yeah.

790
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:50,632
She's like, "Yeah".

791
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,635
She's like, "Yes, look at my shirt.

792
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:53,965
You know I fuck black guys".

793
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,299
How cute are you?

794
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:56,930
You're so cute. You're hot.

795
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,406
I'm not gay.

796
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,500
I've caught a finger,
but you get what I'm saying.

797
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,005
Black guys are the future.

798
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,174
Some chicks are scared.

799
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,013
You know what they say,
"Once you go black,

800
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,347
your parents don't talk to you anymore".

801
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,512
Something like that. I don't know.

802
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,284
I don't know.
Something, like, to that effect.

803
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,223
But black guys...

804
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:17,624
No, I want to do it.

805
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,559
I almost did it last weekend.

806
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,086
I was... like, after the show,

807
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,726
I was standing out, and...
and I was trying to sell my CDs,

808
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,860
and people were like, "No, thanks".

809
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:30,361
And not even of my stand-up.

810
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,499
Just, like, some shit I needed
to get rid of, you know,

811
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,942
<i>like, the Forrest Gump soundtrack,</i>

812
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,570
just some Missy "Misdemeanor" Elliott.

813
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,705
I'm like, "I don't need this".

814
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:40,011
But, no, this dude comes up to me,

815
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,812
this black guy, and he was into it,

816
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,284
'cause, come on.

817
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,809
And...

818
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:49,018
he walks over, and he's
like, "I'm Derek".

819
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,151
And I was like, "Derek?"

820
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,321
He's like, "Derek".

821
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,456
And he had on, like, a nice shirt,

822
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,262
and he had, like, a job.

823
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:05,199
And I was like, "No, I want a brotha".

824
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:09,041
If I'm gonna do it, I wanna
really do it, you know?

825
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,272
Not Derek.

826
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,541
I want him to, like,
not even have a name,

827
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:12,570
just like nicknames.

828
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:13,741
Everyone's like, "Pookie!"

829
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:16,183
He's like, "What's up?"

830
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,686
No job.

831
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,211
We need, like, a ton of lube,
but just, like, for his elbows.

832
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,155
You know what I'm talking about?

833
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,150
Oh, that was insanely racist?

834
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,062
You're right. You're right.

835
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,529
I love joking about race.

836
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:32,660
It's, like, my favorite.

837
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,998
I was talking about this the other day.

838
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,199
I was hanging outwith
literally all my black friend.

839
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:40,437
And...

840
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:44,207
And... and I remember
I was like, "Tamambe,"

841
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,215
or whatever.

842
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:50,242
Tapestry... it's something
wild, you know?

843
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,044
It's something crazy.

844
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:55,182
I mean, that's why they need
Google in the delivery room,

845
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,214
I think, right?

846
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,248
It's everywhere else.

847
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,555
Why not there, right?

848
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,687
So when her mom was like,

849
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,823
I'm gonna name you "Tamambo".

850
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:06,801
Google would show up and say,
"Did you mean Jennifer?"

851
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,176
And her mom would be like,

852
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:16,508
"Yes, Google, I did mean Jennifer.

853
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,377
Thank you".

854
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:21,612
No, Tamambe.

855
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:26,281
So I'm hanging out with Tapioca and...

856
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,551
Tempura or something,
and what was she saying?

857
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,081
She... she was like, "Girl".

858
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,151
Like, I won't do some racist impression,

859
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,184
so don't worry.

860
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:34,992
But she was like, "Girl!"

861
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,233
I mean, we were, like,
mid-double Dutch,

862
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,471
and...

863
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:48,499
And I'm just like,

864
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:51,012
"Stop yelling. We're not at the movies".

865
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,710
Thank you.

866
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,155
Thank you.

867
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:02,680
I'm glad you guys laughed at that.

868
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,922
That does not always work,
I'll be honest with you.

869
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,191
I mean, nothing works
100% of the time, right?

870
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,596
Except Mexicans.

871
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,429
I've noticed...

872
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:13,766
That's the one?

873
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,236
Boo! Right?

874
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:16,738
Boo, Mexicans.

875
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:17,796
I hear ya.

876
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:19,330
You guys are

877
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,468
preaching to the choir.

878
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,049
So, ass play, you guys,
what do you guys think?

879
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,175
For or against?

880
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:30,811
Every night? Okay.

881
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,616
I've dealt with two kinds of guys

882
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,556
when it comes to my personal asshole.

883
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,191
There's the kind of guy that
never acknowledges it, right?

884
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:42,197
Like, the whole time
you're together just never...

885
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,221
which is awesome because who
needs the extra maintenance?

886
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,461
Can I get what-what, ladies?

887
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,729
What-what!

888
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:49,738
Thanks, sister friends.

889
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,500
That guy's awesome, right?

890
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,976
You know what you're
getting with that guy.

891
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,774
And then there's the other kind of guy

892
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,975
who goes for it immediately.

893
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,006
Like, you're not even fully kissing yet,

894
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,383
and he's trying to grab
you like a bowling ball.

895
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,911
You're like, "No!"

896
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,885
He's like, "You said
you like Jeff Dunham".

897
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,624
You're like, "No!"

898
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,801
You can't trust those guys, all right?

899
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,394
So I was dating the first kind of guy,

900
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:22,802
no ass play.

901
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,431
Like, the sex was very vanilla.

902
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,874
There was no funny business,
no dirty talk.

903
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,138
If I sent him a naughty photo,
he would just write back,

904
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:33,080
"Thanks," like I
sent him a fax he needed.

905
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:36,051
Like I had forwarded him an e-vite.

906
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:38,912
So we were together for, like, years,

907
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,616
and one night, out of nowhere,

908
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,123
we're at dinner, and he's like,

909
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,183
"I'd like to talk about something.

910
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,355
I'd like to talk about ass play".

911
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,626
And I'm like, "Is that a Broadway show?

912
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:54,735
"That show sounds awesome.
Let's go see that show".

913
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,261
And he's like, "No, ass play".

914
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,170
And as I'm asking him questions,

915
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,038
I realize he hasn't thought
it through at all.

916
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,907
'Cause I was just like,
"Do you mean on you or me?"

917
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,070
And he was like, "Oh".

918
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,478
I was like, "Oh, Jesus, no".

919
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:10,277
This is not a brainstorm sesh here.

920
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:13,811
Your PowerPoint, buddy.

921
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,653
So that night, I was like,

922
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,953
"I'm gonna call him on his bluff".

923
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,654
I don't usually joke
around in the bedroom,

924
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,423
but I was like, "Fuck this guy".

925
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:21,759
So...

926
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,590
I'm like, "This J.V. player
is gonna get it from me," so...

927
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,167
So we're, like, making
out, and I'm just like,

928
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:36,303
"Psst, where is all the ass play?"

929
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:41,112
And like a frightened child,
he goes, "Tonight?"

930
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,747
And I'm like, "Uh-huh".

931
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:49,019
And he can't think... he goes,
"Well, did you shower?"

932
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:50,582
I said, "I'm not gonna answer that,

933
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,287
'cause I'm not a homeless woman".

934
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:55,695
Just some schizophrenic
with a cart like,

935
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:58,825
"Wash me!"

936
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,265
So he can't think of any
other way to stall,

937
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,774
so this is what he does, okay?

938
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,070
This is my asshole.

939
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:11,705
This is his finger. He goes like this.

940
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:13,942
And he holds it there,

941
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,508
like he was checking it for a pulse.

942
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,811
Like he thought a groundhog
might pop out,

943
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,414
and he'd have
to Whac-A-Mole it.

944
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:26,521
And then I fist him

945
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,997
like you wouldn't believe.

946
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,262
He's dead.

947
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,297
Oh, God, you guys are awesome.

948
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,332
I... seriously,

949
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:42,776
sometimes that goes so awkward,

950
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,507
and during a set, I
just want to, like, tap out.

951
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,980
I've had this image.

952
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,710
Not like a wrestling tap-out,

953
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,843
but just sort of soft-shoe
out of the room

954
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,319
in an awkward situation.

955
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,049
Like, why can't we do that?

956
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,148
I was working at this club,

957
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,852
and... I walked in the first night.

958
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:59,555
And I realized at this club,
there was a bathroom attendant.

959
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,823
Have you ever been like,

960
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,559
"Oh, dope, a bathroom
attendant works here".

961
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:04,827
No, you're like,

962
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:05,959
"Ah, it's awkward".

963
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,492
They hate you.

964
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,368
You hate... you're just
like, "Oh, please".

965
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,565
Like, you know, it's unnecessary.

966
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:11,834
Are you ever peeing like,

967
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,138
"How am I gonna leave here
without a Starburst?"

968
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,807
"I don't like going
without somebody listening".

969
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,439
No.

970
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,143
I go in the bathroom the first night,

971
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:23,947
and the bathroom attendant
stops me at the door.

972
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:26,181
And she's like,

973
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,656
"They're all full right now,

974
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,024
so you're gonna have to wait a minute".

975
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,529
And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah,
I know how bathrooms work".

976
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,191
Like, if she hadn't said that,
I was just gonna go rogue

977
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,498
and start pounding on all the stalls,

978
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,561
up and down with a shiv.

979
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,971
"No!"

980
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:45,996
Peeing in the sink.

981
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,500
"I do what I want,

982
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,979
bathroom attendant!"

983
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,577
I come out. She hands me a paper towel.

984
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,587
"Thank you.

985
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:00,714
"If you hadn't saved me,
I would have just bled

986
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:01,848
"and dripped like stigmata.

987
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,052
Thank you".

988
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,362
So unnecessary.

989
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,386
So, the last night I'm at this club,

990
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,421
I go in the bathroom.

991
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:11,592
She's, like, facing the wall.

992
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:12,623
So I'm like, "Oh, good".

993
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:13,999
I go right in the stall.

994
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,833
And I'm not gonna say anything gross.

995
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:19,363
But I'm in there just
dropping a ton of heat,

996
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,842
Just...

997
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:23,173
massacring this bowl.

998
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,271
Just...

999
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:29,782
I'm texting people, like,

1000
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:30,911
"Am I dying?"

1001
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:34,454
It's like, "Your sister's a nurse".

1002
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:38,119
Things like that.

1003
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:41,425
To a lot of my family,
I just wrote, "Good-bye".

1004
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:47,496
Like, whatever you're picturing,
like, triple it.

1005
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,432
I'm sorry. None of that happened.

1006
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,999
You guys, none of that happened.

1007
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:56,238
You two, you two, none of that happened.

1008
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,644
Hey, did you know there's a show?

1009
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:05,315
Come on, you're pretty.
Just stop talking.

1010
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:08,255
No, I appreciate you
supporting live comedy.

1011
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:11,191
No, none of that happened.

1012
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:12,387
I didn't really...

1013
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,828
you guys... oh, my God,
you guys, then just...

1014
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:16,092
what's go... what are
you guys talking about?

1015
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,121
What's happening?

1016
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,531
Oh, you love me? It's...

1017
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,535
It's their anniversary.

1018
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:22,298
Oh, my God, do you remember
that I don't care?

1019
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,771
No, I'm just kidding.

1020
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:25,501
No, that's exciting.

1021
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:29,839
How many years?

1022
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:33,110
I'm just kidding. I don't
care. I don't care.

1023
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:35,581
No, I don't care.

1024
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:36,744
No, do you guys care?

1025
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:37,912
No? Okay, sorry.

1026
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,249
Sorry, nobody cares.

1027
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,756
Nobody cares.

1028
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:43,690
No, but seriously, thank you
guys so much for coming.

1029
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:44,715
Nobody cares.

1030
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,323
What's your name?

1031
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,422
Erin.

1032
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,797
That was a test. Nobody cares, Erin.

1033
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,864
You guys are so cute. I'm sorry.

1034
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:56,371
Thank you for spending
your anniversary with me.

1035
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:57,701
Mom, thank you.

1036
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:59,207
I'm sorry you have to sit
next to your daughter

1037
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:02,142
when I'm talking
about semen the whole time.

1038
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:06,478
Where do you stand on ass play, Mom?

1039
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:07,573
You're good?

1040
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,845
Okay, you don't want her to
know, but you can't get enough?

1041
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,546
Okay.

1042
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:16,716
You guys won't forget this anniversary.

1043
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,522
What am I... what am I talking about?

1044
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,691
Like, what was I talking about

1045
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,791
before I just talked to you guys?

1046
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,199
Does anybody remember? Shitting.

1047
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,109
I love you guys.

1048
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:35,667
I fucking love this crowd.

1049
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,281
The sweetest voice too.

1050
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,308
"Shitting".

1051
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,752
Oh, God, I wish that happened.

1052
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,724
Like, I wish I was
able to... to do that.

1053
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,624
But I did, I just...

1054
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:52,956
she was facing the wall,

1055
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:55,224
and I'm like... I hear
that she's crying,

1056
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,663
so I'm like,

1057
00:45:56,687 --> 00:46:00,362
"Excuse me. I'm about
to wash my hands, so you...

1058
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,596
"you better get fucking ready."

1059
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:08,974
No, she's crying.

1060
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:10,205
No, I was like, "Well, what's wrong?

1061
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:11,406
"Like, is it your choices?

1062
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,540
Like, what's..."

1063
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,750
No, I asked her what was
wrong, and she was like...

1064
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,652
she told me, she
was like, "My dog died".

1065
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:21,713
So I was like, "I'm so
sorry. I've been there.

1066
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,019
"I'm gonna go get us some shots.

1067
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:24,525
"We're gonna get weird
in here tonight, okay?

1068
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,391
You and me".

1069
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,657
And she goes, "it
just really doesn't feel

1070
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:31,063
like six years ago".

1071
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:34,695
What do you say?

1072
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:35,965
I just looked right at her and just...

1073
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:40,834
What do you do?

1074
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:42,002
I found the owner, I was like,

1075
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:43,773
"She's doing a ton of blow in there.

1076
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,281
You should get rid of her".

1077
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,183
I...

1078
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:53,813
I've been really enjoying
being on the road

1079
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:56,791
ever since the roast, because
I've been on the road, like,

1080
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,090
for years, but...

1081
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:00,652
but people had no idea who I was,

1082
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:02,288
so they would see a picture
of me, and they'd be like,

1083
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,457
"Oh, she looks sweet.

1084
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,263
"She kind of looks, like,
Amish, you know?

1085
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:10,568
"Like... kind of
Cabbage Patchy up top, right?

1086
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:11,937
"We should bring the family.

1087
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:13,305
I bet she talks about, like, shopping".

1088
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,776
And then they get here,
and I'm like, "My pussy..."

1089
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,012
but it's way better now,

1090
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,451
'cause, like, a lot
of people saw that roast,

1091
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,454
and they just are like,
"Oh, she's, like, a bad person".

1092
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,717
So that means you guys are dirtbags too,

1093
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:31,589
and I appreciate you coming out.

1094
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,151
You are bad people.

1095
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:40,223
Thank you, bad people.

1096
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,600
But I've been really lucky.

1097
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,572
Like, my whole life, I found
friends just like me.

1098
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,597
Like, at a young age, I found
girls that were just like me.

1099
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,166
Like, we were all whores.

1100
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,233
You know?

1101
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:51,769
Just little drunks running around.

1102
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,839
But in every group of girlfriends,

1103
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,545
there's always, like, one
that's the sluttiest, you know?

1104
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:58,985
If you don't have that friend,
you're that friend.

1105
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:01,011
Let's be real.

1106
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,359
And it wasn't me in my group of friends.

1107
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,327
Shocker was my nickname.

1108
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:14,696
But, no, in my group
of friends... in my...

1109
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,534
the sluttiest of us was this girl Katie.

1110
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,335
And... we didn't judge her for that.

1111
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:19,932
But she... she wouldn't own it.

1112
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:22,068
Like as soon as she
would have a boyfriend,

1113
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:24,545
she'd start acting like Mother
Teresa, you know?

1114
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,774
She'd, like, walk different.

1115
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:27,213
She talked differently.

1116
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,238
Like, I remember one time

1117
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,444
she walked over with her new boyfriend,

1118
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:30,508
she was like,

1119
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:34,647
"Adam and I are thrilled
you could join us for brunch".

1120
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:37,659
I was like, "I've helped you
get cum out of your hair".

1121
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:44,591
"Remember, we tried using peanut butter

1122
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,123
'cause we're stupid, remember?"

1123
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:53,571
We didn't talk about that
at brunch with Adam.

1124
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:58,205
So she moved to Connecticut
and, like, was getting married,

1125
00:48:58,235 --> 00:48:59,646
and she had a wedding shower there.

1126
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,581
And I was the only friend
from home that could go.

1127
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,381
So I met all of her new,
fancy Connecticut friends.

1128
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:05,751
And, like, you know women like this.

1129
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,084
Like, these girls,

1130
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,454
they were all, like,
very Stepford wife, you know?

1131
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:11,015
They all, like, wore, like,

1132
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:14,120
pastel cashmere cardigans and pearls

1133
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,961
and Burberry, like, tampons.

1134
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,799
And they all spoke like this,
like almost in a whisper.

1135
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:23,168
Like, they all were...

1136
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:25,503
everybody just walked around
whispering to each other.

1137
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,031
Like, "Oh, I guess we were just born

1138
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,839
"with different vocal cords

1139
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:30,173
'cause I was raised better.

1140
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,611
Do you ski?"

1141
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:37,249
So I'm at this party,

1142
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,117
and I'm, like, mainlining chardonnay,

1143
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,883
trying to remember fun.

1144
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,955
Just like, "Why?"

1145
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:48,953
So one of the girls was like,
"Let's play a game".

1146
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:52,092
And I'm like,
"Suicide pact? I'll go first.

1147
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:54,625
This party's the worst".

1148
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,467
And she goes, "No, let's all go around

1149
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,837
and admit something".

1150
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:01,069
And I'm like, "Oh, no".

1151
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,044
So these girls are going around.

1152
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:06,877
They are... the shit
they're admitting is so boring.

1153
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:08,541
I can't... like, one girl was like,

1154
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:10,552
"Once, I forgot to let
the dog out all day!"

1155
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:13,111
And they were all like, "No!"

1156
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:19,052
I'm like, "Is this
happening right now?"

1157
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:22,029
So the girl that goes right
before me, Bridget,

1158
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:24,157
the worst human I've ever met.

1159
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,393
I hope she sees this.

1160
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,732
That's how bad of a person she is.

1161
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:32,098
Like, Bridget, I
hope you're watching this.

1162
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:33,130
But she wouldn't.

1163
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:36,906
She wouldn't be up this late.

1164
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,037
She spoke the softest.

1165
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:39,376
You had to, like, lean in and squint

1166
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:40,882
and read her lips, 'cause she just...

1167
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:43,885
Bridget talked like an angel

1168
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:45,682
was sleeping on her tongue.

1169
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:52,587
<i># No one wake the angel</i>

1170
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,426
<i># On my tongue</i>

1171
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:56,590
That's not a real song,

1172
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,031
Comedy Central.

1173
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,127
So, anyway, she's like,

1174
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,537
"All right, you guys, it's my turn.

1175
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,063
Bring it in".

1176
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,632
And we're like, "We're
in 'cause we have to be,

1177
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:09,701
'cause you talk like Fievel".

1178
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:14,311
Use your diaphragm, Bridge.

1179
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:15,338
So she's like,

1180
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:16,749
"I'll admit this.

1181
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:20,220
"Sometimes after Richard falls asleep,

1182
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,917
I get up and eat ice cream".

1183
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:27,361
I just wanted to find one
other pair of eyes being like,

1184
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:30,092
"What a dumb cunt, right?"

1185
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,929
But nothing. No one.

1186
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:36,233
They're all looking at her like,
"Bridget! You should be asleep".

1187
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:43,102
"Bridget, it's night. Carbs? Come on".

1188
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,241
So then it's my turn,

1189
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,806
and... I don't look at my friend Katie.

1190
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,911
I just feel her just glaring
at me, just like,

1191
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,913
"Don't be yourself right now, bitch!

1192
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,017
This is my new life".

1193
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:59,288
And so I'm like,

1194
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:02,195
"Okay... first of all, Bridget,

1195
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,699
thank you for being so brave".

1196
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,571
"I'll admit this.

1197
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:15,736
"It's kind of like your ice cream thing.

1198
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:18,473
"One time

1199
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:22,211
I let a cab driver finger me".

1200
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,963
And Katie's like,

1201
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,628
"That's not how you play, Amy".

1202
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,660
I'm like, "Really?
'Cause I feel like I won.

1203
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:46,401
I feel..." You guys,
you were an amazing crowd.

1204
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,272
Thank you so much.

1205
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:24,542
I feel like this is
what I would feel like,

1206
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:27,549
like, if I ever kept a baby.

1207
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:30,347
You know, like, this kind of joy.

1208
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:50,737
Thank you guys so much.

1209
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:57,139
Thank you.

1210
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:59,169
Fuck, thank you.

1211
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:05,682
Oh!

1212
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:08,690
I want to jerk you
all off, even the girls.

1213
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:10,453
Even the girls.

1214
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,959
Guys, thank you.

1215
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:13,290
I really, really appreciate it.

1216
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:14,886
I know you guys are thinking like,

1217
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,226
"What are you doing back out here?"

1218
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,596
And some of you were just thinking like,

1219
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:21,000
"You're so pretty".

1220
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:22,503
Thank all of you.

1221
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:24,562
But I wanted to come out
and just sort of, like,

1222
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,904
give you an opportunity if
anybody wants to ask a question,

1223
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,341
like, now it's the time.

1224
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,311
It doesn't have to be about my set.

1225
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:31,505
Yeah? What's your name?

1226
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:33,241
And what... what actor are you?

1227
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,149
I'm Cubed.

1228
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:38,174
What?

1229
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,482
My name's Cubed.

1230
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:41,216
Cubed?

1231
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:43,383
Does anybody different have a question?

1232
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:45,983
With a name that makes sense?

1233
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:48,121
No, I'm just kidding.
What... what happened?

1234
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:49,824
Where... where are your parents from?

1235
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:50,957
What are you doing later?

1236
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:51,988
What am I doing later?

1237
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,092
Ooh, Cubed.

1238
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,034
Do you have HPV? Do you want it?

1239
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:02,802
I haven't drank in two months,
getting ready for this.

1240
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:05,642
So I'm gonna, like, black out.

1241
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:07,671
If anybody wants to get down with me,

1242
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:09,274
like, sexually,

1243
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,344
tonight is not the night.

1244
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,446
But, yes, I'm gonna tie one on.

1245
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,924
Anybody... yes, you,
sir. What's your name?

1246
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:19,392
- Rick.
- Hi, Rick.

1247
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,293
I want to give you a standing

1248
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,764
I think we all should
give you a standing ovation.

1249
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:28,660
This guy's sad 'cause he's wasted.

1250
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:31,798
You don't have to... thank you.

1251
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:35,105
This is good for the camera.

1252
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,436
Wow.

1253
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:41,142
Thank you.

1254
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:45,718
Okay, okay. Thank you.

1255
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,551
That was... that was nice.

1256
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:48,885
A lot of people weren't into it.

1257
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:51,119
Like, a lot of people got up
and were just kind of, like...

1258
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:54,795
"Our reservations were,
like, ten minutes ago.

1259
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:56,525
When's this bitch gonna wrap it up?"

1260
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:59,090
Yes, you, gorgeous. Hi.

1261
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:00,396
Can I buy you a drink,

1262
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:03,233
possibly have a cocktail
with you at some point?

1263
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:04,260
Ooh, this is awesome.

1264
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:05,739
You can definitely buy me a drink.

1265
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,400
I don't... I'm not gay.

1266
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,535
I mean, I've caught a
finger. I'm not boring.

1267
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,568
Trust me.

1268
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,603
But, yeah, I could totally
see that happening.

1269
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:15,445
I don't think that
would be weird at all.

1270
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:17,008
Your boyfriend doesn't seem too psyched,

1271
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,021
but he's all fired up about Pride.

1272
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,716
Oh, yes, you. Hi.

1273
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:26,091
So... who is your comedy mentor?

1274
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,459
My comedy mentor.

1275
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,259
That's a good question.

1276
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:32,357
I hang out with
mostly 45-year-old dudes.

1277
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,925
Thank you.

1278
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:35,698
They're all comedians.
They're alcoholics.

1279
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,467
Like, they don't drink anymore
'cause they can't, you know?

1280
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:39,530
And it makes sense,

1281
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,303
because, like, they look
at me, and they're just like,

1282
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:42,435
"Oh, my God".

1283
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:45,412
Like, they think I'm so hot
just 'cause I'm not their wives.

1284
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:47,606
I walk in, they're like...

1285
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:49,310
<i># Who's that girl? #</i>

1286
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:50,477
I'm like, "What?"

1287
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:52,509
But out, like, you know, in the streets,

1288
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:54,283
people are just throwing
lit cigarettes at me.

1289
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,620
They're like, "Ugh, pass".

1290
00:56:56,646 --> 00:57:00,150
So, like, Dave Attell and Jim Norton.

1291
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:03,456
Right?

1292
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,362
And so... yeah, you
gotta love those guys.

1293
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:07,959
Yeah... yes.

1294
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:09,561
- Of women...
- Women.

1295
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,868
- Comics, who is your mentor?
- Okay.

1296
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:15,365
Okay, well, Jessica
Kirson was my mentor.

1297
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:17,207
Like, she's in New York,
and she's amazing.

1298
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:19,179
And then... sort of where she left off,

1299
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,739
I just like... my mentor, like,
those guys took me on the road

1300
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,773
to open for them a lot, so that's why.

1301
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:25,650
But I grew up loving Gilda

1302
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:27,586
and Goldie Hawn,

1303
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,523
and I love Margaret Cho,
and Sarah... Palin.

1304
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:31,719
I'm just kidding.

1305
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:35,819
You, sir.

1306
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:37,331
What's your feeling on anal bleaching?

1307
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:38,388
Anal bleaching.

1308
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:40,492
I'm glad somebody brought this up.

1309
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,767
That's a great question.

1310
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,864
Okay, so here's how I feel about it.

1311
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:47,101
When I heard about it, I was just like,

1312
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,041
"Ew, everybody, chill out".

1313
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:50,635
But then I looked at my own asshole,

1314
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:53,739
and I was like, "Whoa!

1315
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,477
"That looks like something
out of the universe.

1316
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:56,643
Maybe we should hook that up".

1317
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:58,380
But I still haven't done anything.

1318
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:01,412
But I keep a low pro, butt-wise.

1319
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:03,151
You... I'm doing God's work.

1320
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:04,920
I mean, am I healing people? Yes?

1321
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:06,655
What's your favorite city?

1322
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:07,923
My favorite city?

1323
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,259
New York City...

1324
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:12,061
Yeah...

1325
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:16,059
Sorry, one girl's like, "Boo".

1326
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:18,902
I like Madison, Wisconsin.

1327
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:21,598
Nice.

1328
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,633
And I think Cleveland's the worst.

1329
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:29,983
Yes, you, sir?

1330
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,280
Why is your sister here?

1331
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:33,048
Why is my sister here?

1332
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:35,750
You know what? I have no idea.

1333
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:37,587
I didn't fly her in. She showed up.

1334
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,150
She shows up wherever I am.

1335
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:43,756
My sister is here because...

1336
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,663
she's my best friend in the whole world,

1337
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,998
and I love her and
trust her more than anyone.

1338
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,368
And I dedicate this show to her.

1339
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:55,504
And I want to thank my mom,
who's not a cunt at all.

1340
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,034
My mom... please clap for my mom.

1341
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:58,409
She's not a cunt.

1342
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:02,310
But her bush was huge
when I was growing up.

1343
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:04,045
That was true.

1344
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:06,576
Okay, yeah?

1345
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:09,146
Do you have to pee as bad as I do?

1346
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:11,124
Oh, okay, she has to pee,
and she's really pretty.

1347
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:12,353
So everyone's, like,

1348
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,827
given her whatever
she wants her whole life.

1349
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:20,964
I don't have to pee at all.

1350
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,298
It's pretty sweet.

1351
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:25,238
I feel, like, physically,
real comfortable up here.

1352
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:26,740
I could hang out.

1353
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:28,071
If you don't mind,

1354
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:30,373
I'm gonna do my 90-minute
one-woman show now.

1355
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:38,241
Thank you.

1356
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:40,083
Thank you, Comedy Central,

1357
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:41,554
and thank you guys.

1358
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,989
Thank you.

1359
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:57,436
Oh, God, Dad died.

1360
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,462
When?

1361
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:01,907
I guess, like, today.

1362
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:07,644
Are you gonna talk about it onstage?

1363
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,671
Yeah.

1364
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:10,013
Yeah? You should open with it.
