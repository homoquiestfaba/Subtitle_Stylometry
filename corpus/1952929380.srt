given to know

3
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,193
the secrets of
the kingdom of heaven.

4
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,896
But for others,
they are in parables.

5
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:42,602

00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,515
You look nice.

9
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,716
That's because
I'm going to church.

10
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,350
I'm not going.

11
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:01,655
It's my only day off.

12
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:05,824
Are you gonna
come down here

13
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,164
and have a civilized breakfast
with your son?

14
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,634
- I'll go get him.
- Thank you.

15
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,234
Dad!

16
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,673
man: You know how you can feel
what's bothering someone

17
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,267
just by looking at 'em?

18
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,402
Dad?

19
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,514

( weeping )

00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,071
Oh, God.

56
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,581
Sorry.

57
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,512
( crying )

58
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:48,555
I can't do it.

59
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,528
woman: So the sex is not
mixed up with love or intimacy

60
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:56,830
or emotions or connections

61
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,803
or any of that kind of
bullshit.

62
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,806
I mean, that notion of love
is so pre-Gloria Steinem.

63
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,741
It's so 1950s
"mother's little helper,

64
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,335
bake me a pound cake in
Gary, Indiana."

65
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,902
woman: Jamie, I know.

66
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,575
I mean, for fuck's sakes,
I am a liberated woman here.

67
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,016
I am a postmillennial girl.

68
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,451
Having sex is not something
I should be made

69
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,181
to feel guilty about.

70
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,315
I mean, men don't feel bad
about it when they do it,

71
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,256
so why should I?

72
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,588
Jamie, you're so right.

73
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,757
( ding )

74
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,398
( moaning )

75
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,876
Okay.

76
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,510
Well...

77
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,617
Thank you.

78
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:53,954
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

79
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,187
You're welcome.

80
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,058
- Yeah.
- Or...

81
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,564
I'm sorry, thank you.

82
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,793
That was, um...
that was fine.

83
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,070
So what are you doing later?

84
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,405
It was nice to have
met you.

85
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,908
( sighing )

86
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,782
man: It ain't always easy to
see the upside of shit.

87
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,482
man: Welcome to
the Bordasch/Newman Agency.

88
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,550
Thanks for joining our
focus-group family.

89
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,323
Today your moderator is Fred.

90
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,631
What we have is a market-
prototype presentation.

91
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,364
It's a mockup,
it's not a finished commercial.

92
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,702
What we're doing and what we
need your help with

93
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,104
is to figure out

94
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,439
how what you see
on the television screen

95
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,637
makes you feel, okay?

96
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,147
And don't pay any attention
to the cameras.

97
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,150
Our writers are just
observing your reactions

98
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,652
and that's why on the piece of
paper that I gave you,

99
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,985
under the heading,
"My thoughts,"

100
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,957
we want you to
write your thoughts.

101
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,493
Okay?

102
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,825
So let's start.

103
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,227
man: Holzhammer Chowder.

104
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,322
Phillip Katz.

105
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,196
V-2-6-3-F.

106
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,930
Sex doesn't have to be
confused by love or intimacy

107
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,598
or emotions or connections.

108
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:18,041
Men don't feel bad about it
when they do it.

109
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,738
So why should you?

110
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,178
Mmm...

111
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,886
Holzhammer's Clam Chowder!

112
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:32,822
Mm-hmm!

113
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,154
Holzhammer's Clam Chowder.

114
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,354
Tastes like
a bowl of heaven.

115
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,862
Holzhammer's Clam Chowder.

116
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,625
Tastes like
heaven in a bowl.

117
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,561
All right.

118
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,331
Don't forget to indicate which
catchphrase appeals to you.

119
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,535
Phillip Katz,
I think you have what it takes

120
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,134
to be a Clio Award winner!

121
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,315
But you're not there yet.

122
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:00,079
Take for instance this
commercial you did today.

123
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:04,055
It's fun, it's zany,
it has a hook.

124
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,522
But...

125
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:09,254
what exactly are you trying
to say to the world?

126
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,558
What am I trying to
say to the world?

127
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,759
Phil, tonight, I'm gonna
ask you to do something.

128
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:18,099
I want you to stay here
in this revered firm,

129
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,265
in this historic
downtown building.

130
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,901
I want you to formulate and
fulminate and fabricate.

131
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:29,175
I want you to dream
fruitful dreams all night long,

132
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,478
until you come up with
exactly what you,

133
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,577
Phillip Katz, junior
copywriter extraordinaire,

134
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,178
wants to tell the world--

135
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,854
What you want to
tell the world.

136
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,255
About?

137
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,662
Clam chowder?

138
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,461
Resolve the pitch.

139
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,695
Taste the creamiest chowder.

140
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,794

141
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,601

This is Phillip.

144
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,143
Mrs. Katz: I don't think
it's healthy

145
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,705
for you to go
back to work so soon.

146
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,445
- Hi, Mom, how are you?
- I made dinner

147
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,817
and I don't appreciate you
letting it get cold.

148
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,549
Phillip: Pestering a chowder,

149
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,454
- the nagging chowder.
- Hello?

150
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,049
- Are you there?
- Yeah.

151
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,115

See, most people,
they just walk by,

184
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,587
nobody even looks you
in the eye anymore.

185
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:57,061
And they all
say the same thing...

186
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,290
"I'll get you on
the way out."

187
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,399
Are those helping you?

188
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:03,901
Excuse me?

189
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,528
The pills.

190
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,539
What needs of yours are
being met by taking them?

191
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,835
Needs?

192
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,172
Uh...

193
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,801
My mom's doctor
gave them to me.

194
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:13,810
Bingo.

195
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,938
Tell the man what he won.

196
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,277
( chuckling )

197
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,345
Do you see the difference
between the question

198
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,319
I asked you
and the answer I got?

199
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,787
I asked you what needs
are being met

200
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,949
and you told me your
mother's physician said

201
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,357
that they were
"permittable."

202
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,361
Hey, lady!

203
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,420
It's not what you are,
it's who you are.

204
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,932
I want to see your
shoulders back and your chin up

205
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,434
the next time you
walk by here

206
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,902
so I know that you're
thinking better of yourself.

207
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,029
( chuckling )

208
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,131
Ha-ha.

209
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,108
You talk like that
to everyone?

210
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,906
Only my disciples.

211
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:47,968
Wanna enlist?

212
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,537
( change rattling )

213
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,414
Uh...

214
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,319
I don't have any change.

215
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,914
Let me get you
on the way out.

216
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,159
My message was not intended
to guilt you

217
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,958
into acting charitable.

218
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,328
Yeah, if we--

219
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,594
You and I can empathize,

220
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:13,105
if I can tell you how your
actions impact my needs.

221
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,764
Let me get my coffee
and I'll take care of you.

222
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,807
Thanks-- thanks.

223
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,776
You ought to
loosen up that tie.

224
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,402
You wear it like a noose.

225
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,883
The only truth
is your own truth!

226
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:30,680
A noose?

227
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,849
My... my father just--
he just--

228
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,483
He just hung himself.

229
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,697
Congratulations.

230
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:46,696
woman on TV:
Sorry to interrupt

231
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,296
your regular scheduled
programming,

232
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,241
but we have breaking news
here at the Channel 8 desk.

233
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,245
Channel 8, hard news 24/7.

234
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,610
What we are hearing
unofficially

235
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,546
is that they are
predicting the sun

236
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,016
has anywhere from one week to
six months of hydrogen left...

237
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,348
Phillip?

238
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,648
... before it runs out of fuel
and collapses

239
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,952
- onto itself completely.
- Phillip Katz?

240
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,651
- Do you want a receipt?
- They have been furiously

241
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,523
making calculations
about the amount of hydrogen

242
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,755
Ieft at the core of the sun
and it does not--

243
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,320
The sun's dying,
you wanna fuck?

244
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,387
( tape rewinding )

245
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,957
Do you want a receipt?

246
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,559
Yeah.

247
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,000
What did you mean by
"congratulations"?

248
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,167
Where are my manners?

249
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,437
Gabe.

250
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,206
Phillip Katz.

251
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,304
- What's alive in you, brother?
- Huh?

252
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:32,111
You see, I used to be
a divorce attorney,

253
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,481
pulling people apart

254
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,679
when I could have been
putting them together.

255
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,657
Y'know, what I meant is that
we are all born preloaded

256
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,716
with the tragedy
of our parents dying.

257
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:42,920
The worst is over.

258
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,395
You're halfway home.

259
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,456
Well, now you don't
have to worry about

260
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,297
what he thought about you,

261
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,769
how he made you feel,
what he taught you,

262
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,396
how he punished you.

263
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,735
What the fuck
did he know anyway?

264
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,503
He took the easy way out.

265
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:00,477
Now you can be your own man
and look to yourself.

266
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:09,018
( humming sustained pitch )

267
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,027
That's the $10 version.

268
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,363
Out of this event,

269
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,032
out of this grief,
out of this mourning,

270
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,939
from this corner on,

271
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,104
you will be known to us as

272
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,446
Son of Morning!

273
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,516
Thanks for taking the time to
connect with me.

274
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,392
Now go and be the change

275
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,954
you wish to
see in this world.

276
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,816
( dog barking )

277
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,628
Oh...

278
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,070
man: Returning now to
a Channel 5 special report.

279
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:43,444
Welcome back to our continuing
coverage of Planetary Panic.

280
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,449
We know you've got a lot
of options to choose from

281
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,348
here in
the South Florida area...

282
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,943
( multiple TVs blaring )

283
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,852
woman on TV: If it were
only for this

284
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,949
Earth would probably be
spared, but new research...

285
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,688
man on TV:... begin when the
core temperature reaches

286
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,787
around 100 million Kelvins.

287
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,695
Waves and extreme
rainfall events,

288
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,701
floods, possibly
wind events, like storms.

289
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,260
More bad news
for the ailing sun,

290
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,067
this time out of Belgium.

291
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,370
Climate models predict that
over the next five days,

292
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,206
we are likely to see a rise
in global average temperatures

293
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,713
of maybe 1 or 1 ½

294
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,043
... all report severe
disruptions

295
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,879
in cellular service today,

296
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,886
responsible for global system
mobile communication...

297
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,114
Mom?

298
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,679
I've taken a job
at a coffee shop.

299
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,282
Do you think you're
gonna be okay?

300
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,849
I have nobody.

301
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,703
There's a special
prayer service for the sun.

302
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,667
I can't go.

303
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,264
I need you to come with me.

304
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,934
In layman's terms,
if you would, please, sir,

305
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,443
tell us a little bit about
the mechanics

306
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,537
of what's going on
with the sun right now.

307
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,744
Well, Jim, there comes a time
in the life cycle of every star

308
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,410
when man...

309
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:57,887
Each man must
ask his Father,

310
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,447
his Holy Father,

311
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,857
to forgive him his sins

312
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:06,159
and to forgive us
the sins of humanity,

313
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,325
to quench the fiery storm above

314
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:13,701
and relieve us
of the dangers of the vacuum

315
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:16,741
of His might.

316
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,607
God has forgotten us,

317
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:24,377
abandoned us
because we have forgotten Him.

318
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,748
We have abandoned Him.

319
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,727
God has forgotten you

320
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:43,234
because you
have forgotten Him

321
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,896
and because you,
my children,

322
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:49,202
have abandoned His church.

323
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:52,505
All He asks of us,
all He asks...

324
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,603
Clam chowder?

325
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,946
... is more talking gerbil.

326
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,217
( speaking in
foreign language )

327
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,027
( screaming )

328
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,905
( chanting in Latin )

329
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,447
Holy...

330
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,748
( all shouting )

331
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:37,982
Stop that!

332
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,025
This is a church!

333
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:40,922
Phillip!

334
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,160
I'm in a church in Boca.

335
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,822
I have a breaking story.

336
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,697
I'm gonna get an interview
and this is gonna be big!

337
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,063
This one's for you.

338
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,865
man on TV: Sorry to interrupt,
but it looks like

339
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,238
we have some
breaking news for you

340
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,004
in an exclusive report
from Channel 5

341
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,842
entertainment reporter
Josephine Tuttle in Boca Raton.

342
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,109
Josephine: In 1858, it was
Lourdes, France,

343
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,414
where Bernadette Soubirous saw
the Virgin Mary 18 times.

344
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,681
On October 13, 1917,

345
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,280
it was Portugal where hundreds
of spectators

346
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:15,224
claimed to have seen
Our Lady of Fàtima in the sky.

347
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:19,628
Now, almost 90 years later,
another miracle has occurred,

348
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,258
this time in the exclusive
South Florida resort town

349
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,699
of Boca Raton.

350
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,130
Welcome.

351
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,105
My name is Thomas.

352
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,368
I'll be your concierge

353
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,376
for the duration
of your stay with us.

354
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,002
Josephine: There was
pandemonium inside

355
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,876
the Third Nicene Church
of Boca Raton

356
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,473
where tears of, yes, blood

357
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,711
flowed not from the eyes
of the Virgin Mary statue

358
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,118
but from an actual
congregation member

359
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:46,021
known for the moment only as
"Phillip. "

360
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,456
Come on, come on,
come on...

361
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,187
Members of the small
ecumenical congregation

362
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,819
came out today to pray for
the health of the sun,

363
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,955
but what they found was
an entirely different

364
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,761
kind of "son" altogether.

365
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,529
This was the scene
just hours ago,

366
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:01,004
a fervor of hysteria
to see, touch and hear

367
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:05,874
the man that many are already
calling a modern-day messiah.

368
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,378
( siren blaring )

369
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,348
Sorry, sir,
are you still resting?

370
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,678
No.

371
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:13,979
Am I in a hotel?

372
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,519
That you are.

373
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,488
The owner should be arriving
in town a week Thursday.

374
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:21,549
He'd very much like to
come up for a meet and greet,

375
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,094
probably be accompanied
by his usual

376
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,995
coterie of
derelict child stars

377
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,793
and strung-out
supermodels.

378
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,834
Should be mildly amusing.

379
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,894
He's footing the bill, so...

380
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,872
You've received
a great number of gifts.

381
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,273
Just here in the living room.

382
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,908
Oh, my God.

383
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,620
Most of them are from fans.

384
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,246
There are a few
from corporate sponsors

385
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,655
wanting endorsements,
no doubt.

386
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,454
And there's a delegation
from the governor's office

387
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,653
that wants
to meet with you.

388
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,559
- What's going on?
- Sir?

389
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,892
What is this?

390
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,023
What is what?

391
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,657
This-- this real?

392
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:03,996
This is real?

393
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,536
Well, I suppose that really
depends on your

394
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,300
definition of reality.

395
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,433
If that's all,
sir, have a blessed day.

396
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,478
And you might stay away
from the windows.

397
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,739
The Romans
are growing restless.

398
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,111
They're running low on bread.

399
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:20,174
And you are, as I'm sure
you've realized by now,

400
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,685
the circus.

401
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,755
( gasping )

402
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,899
( doorbell ringing )

403
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,277
( knocking )

404
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,043
I'm sorry, are you
in the middle of a bath?

405
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:54,381
I can wait outside
until you're done.

406
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,853
Atmospheric.

407
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,651
You like it
atmospheric, huh?

408
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,419
- Who are you?
- Josephine.

409
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,652
Oh, I'm Phillip.

410
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:02,853
I know.

411
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,260
- Did you arrange all this?
- I did.

412
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,627
I just happened to
be at the church,

413
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,859
praying for that sun thing,
or against it.

414
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,128
Whatever.

415
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,602
- You understand.
- So you saw what happened.

416
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:13,899
I did, I saw
what happened to you

417
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,303
and I realized immediately

418
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,671
that you were gonna need
a friend,

419
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,209
someone to insulate
you from the wolves

420
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,938
and the succubi.

421
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,377
Hi, Mrs. Katz.

422
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,107
I'm David
from Alchemy Talent.

423
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,978
You spoke to my assistant.

424
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,484
Flew in from the coast on the
first red-eye I could catch.

425
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,281
Can I come in and talk?

426
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,281
Sure.

427
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:33,984
Great.

428
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,028
This is Chad and Jim.

429
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,528
Could they come in, too?

430
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,996
Josephine: I want you to
be able to trust me.

431
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,555
There's gonna be many other
so-called news journalists

432
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,157
and they're
gonna promise you things:

433
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,032
money, trust, confidentiality.

434
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,934
They'd even do things,
sexual things.

435
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:48,529
They're all whores.

436
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,768
I was at the church
with you, praying.

437
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,901
I was touched...

438
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,879
... by what you did.

439
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:02,051
I appreciate all this,
I really do, it's amazing.

440
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,385
I just don't think that what
they say about me is--

441
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,924
I just think
that the blood...

442
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,016
The blood.

443
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,526
... from my eye,

444
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,118
I think it was
because I stopped taking

445
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,027
my stress medication.

446
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,122
Oh.

447
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,598
That was not stress.

448
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,101
That was not the result of not
taking stress pills.

449
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,637
Forget about those pills.

450
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,263
Don't ever mention those
pills again, ever, to anyone.

451
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,001
Okay, I-- I--
I am pretty sure

452
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,633
that I'm not what
they think I am.

453
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,302
I'm pretty sure
I'm not what you think.

454
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:27,504
I want to help you.

455
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,672
I want to do a one-hour

456
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:33,013
exclusive in-studio
interview with you.

457
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,019
Just you and me.

458
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,748
And the lighting guy.

459
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,084
The sound guy, the cameraman
and the grips.

460
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,852
Just you getting
your message across.

461
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,154
You'll have to pull up
your breeches

462
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,489
and you have to
grow some balls

463
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,690
and just accept your destiny.

464
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,524
Mmm.

465
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,797
Mmm... this is
delicious cheese.

466
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,533
Mrs. Katz, we've done
a little research.

467
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,302
We know about the refinancing.

468
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,970
We know about the second and
third mortgages on this house.

469
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,569
I told him.

470
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,650
I'm not good at finances.

471
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,185
I told him.

472
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,118
What am I, an economist?

473
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,019
Mrs. Katz.

474
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,354
- Mrs. Katz.
- Mrs. Katz.

475
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:18,886
Your husband also left a
sizable debt in his business.

476
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,831
I warned him
every day for years,

477
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,630
but he never listened to me.

478
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:25,761
Nope.

479
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,600
Your student loans
are out of control.

480
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,230
Five graduate degrees.

481
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,934
A Master's in Ornithology.

482
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,271
What is that, even?

483
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,206
Birds.

484
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,475
You are the king now

485
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,813
and the people deserve to
know what their king

486
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,409
is dreaming
about, don't they?

487
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,977
I've been having a dream.

488
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,250
- Huh.
- Mmm, mmm...

489
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,519
Actually, I've been having it
over and over again.

490
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,787
What is that, Brie?

491
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,123
Maybe you're right.

492
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,185
Of course I am.

493
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,561
About what?

494
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,395
Maybe my dream has some
significance for the world.

495
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,900
I'm sure it's very important.

496
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,459
All told, you're down,
give or take,

497
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:03,030
about a half
a million dollars.

498
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,735
I did the best I could.

499
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,268
If I could get ahold
of your son...

500
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,213
If you could convince
Phillip to sign with us.

501
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,183
- Mrs. Katz.
- Mrs. Katz.

502
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,583
Mrs. Katz.

503
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,588
We're gonna let people
know who you are,

504
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,090
what you've done,
what you're going to do.

505
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,318
Mrs. Katz.

506
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,554
- Mrs. Katz.
- Mrs. Katz.

507
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,323
You'd be out of debt
by the end of the month.

508
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,728
So I don't want to
pressure you,

509
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,766
but I need to let my
boss know in the next hour

510
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,768
or he's probably
gonna fire me.

511
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,497
- Do we have a deal?
- Do we have a deal?

512
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:37,003
man: In response to the rapidly
escalating situation,

513
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,100
an emergency multinational
conference of astronomers,

514
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,042
astrophysicists, and...

515
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,602
- Is he the son of God, or...
- He is the son of God.

516
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,308
I think he's the son of
the son of God, no?

517
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:46,612
- Grandson of God.
- Yeah, that works.

518
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,118
So that's what
we're gonna go with?

519
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,483
He's the grandson of God,
then, because--

520
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:50,919
No, that or we can
just stay with "messiah,"

521
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:51,978
if that makes it easier.

522
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,217
It's up to you--
I think that's better.

523
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,519
I think that "grandson,"
it limits

524
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,060
the audience potential
in terms of demographics.

525
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,287
Oh, fine.

526
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,296
Great, we're sticking with
"messiah" then, perfect.

527
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,355
Laurel, looking forward
to your story next week.

528
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:02,457
Next week?

529
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,161
Are we even gonna be
alive next week?

530
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,261
Has anyone heard
anything about the sun?

531
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,499
Have you all forgotten about
the fact that the sun

532
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:09,699
is about to turn into

533
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,901
a massive
fucking vacuum cleaner?

534
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,009
I told you before, if you
can't control this sun thing,

535
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,143
I'm gonna yank you

536
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,653
and replace you
with the weekend girl.

537
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:29,525
All right, boys.

538
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:30,583
Sandy.

539
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:31,959
Henchy.

540
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,931
Gentlemen... Iet's dance.

541
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:42,766
You ready?

542
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,908
I can do that.

543
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,284
Okay, what we need
out of him for sidebars,

544
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,411
has he performed any miracles
that we don't know about?

545
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,479
Has he been arrested,
misdemeanors or fines?

546
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,922
Does he have a girlfriend?

547
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,720
Is he gay, does he have
a gay lover, if so, who?

548
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:02,885
- Josephine, this is Frederick.
- Hold on.

549
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,155
Frederick.

550
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,719
... the network decided
to carry the interview.

551
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:07,059
Nice work.

552
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,066
The network's decided
to pick up the feed.

553
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,193
Phillip, you're gonna become
a nationwide phenomenon,

554
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,827
bigger than Je--

555
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,394
Bigger than The Beatles.

556
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,277
Oh, my God.

557
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,041
man: Counting down.

558
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,017
Ten... nine...

559
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,348
Woo!

560
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,479
This is gonna be huge.

561
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:31,783
Is this not
gonna be great, huh?

562
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:34,381
I love that kid, I goddamn
love that kid, right?

563
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,921
( tone ringing )

564
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,060
Now that you
have the spotlight,

565
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,760
the attention of the people,

566
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:45,826
what is the message that
you'd like to get across?

567
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,304
What is it that you'd like
to say to the world?

568
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,747
Yeah.

569
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,717
( chuckling )

570
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:04,280
Look at him, there he is.

571
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,119
That's God.

572
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,328
What you feel,
what you really feel.

573
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,768
It's a complete
and total clusterfuck.

574
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,444
Next question,
go to the next question!

575
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,744
Josephine, go to the next
question, please.

576
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,808
You've chosen to reveal
yourself here in South Florida.

577
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,218
What made you choose this
particular locale

578
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:39,279
for your cotillion?

579
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,323
Did she just say
his cotillion?

580
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,557
Say something!

581
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:48,724
Say something,
you ruinous prick!

582
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,324
There's been a lot of
speculation,

583
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,926
particularly in
the blogosphere,

584
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,166
that you've come to the Earth
to make some sort of sacrifice

585
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,698
for the sun so that
it doesn't die.

586
00:27:58,777 --> 00:27:59,801
( phone ringing )

587
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,209
Channel 5.

588
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:04,877
- It's his mom.
- Are you crazy?

589
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,007
I'm not gonna put
that idiot's mother

590
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,711
on live national television!

591
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,886
Hey, remember that guy
I fucked the other day?

592
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,358
At the coast bar?

593
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,400
Say something.

594
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,801
Patch her through.

595
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,304
His mom.

596
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,402
His mom.

597
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,605
What?

598
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,875
The messiah's mother.

599
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:40,042
Messiah's mother!

600
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,052
- Messiah's mother!
- What?

601
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,089
The fucking messiah's mother's
on the phone!

602
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,283
Uh-oh!

603
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:48,723
Phillip.

604
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:50,454
Phillip, I don't
think it's fair

605
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,792
you get to have all the fun.

606
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,661
Mrs. Katz--

607
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,702
Phillip, there are hundreds
of people outside our house

608
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,828
holding candles.

609
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:03,101
They keep asking me
if I'm a virgin.

610
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,438
I'm a widow!

611
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,807
Push into his eyes.

612
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,848
( chanting in Latin )

613
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:18,778

634
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,780
- Hello?
- Mrs. Katz.

635
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,348
I have David from
Alchemy Talent for you.

636
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,223
David?

637
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,728
I'm surrounded.

638
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,661
They won't leave.

639
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,459
Hi, this is David.

640
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,629
David, what do these
people want from me?

641
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,369
Hello?

642
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:47,070
I have David.

643
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,305
David?

644
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,281
Yeah, hi, I'm here, hi.

645
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,647
I-- I called him
on the phone,

646
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,276
I did what you said.

647
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,285
Mrs. Katz.

648
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,946
Mrs. Katz,
you need to go to him.

649
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,047
He's your son and this
is his time of need.

650
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:02,558
Also, I pitched him
really hard at the staff lunch

651
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,060
and it could not have
gone better.

652
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,494
Go to him,
go to him, Mrs. Katz.

653
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:10,295
Go to him and make
him understand

654
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,563
what he needs to understand.

655
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,071
Oh, I gotta take this.

656
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,903
All right,
let me know how it goes.

657
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,204
David?

658
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,844
( group applauding )

659
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,421
The governor asked me to
come down here today,

660
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,155
meet with you

661
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,754
and figure out
what we have in common

662
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,355
and see how we might be able
to work together

663
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,333
over the course of
the next couple months

664
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:21,805
before the election rears
its ugly little head...

665
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,341
yeah...

666
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,877
to see what you
want to accomplish

667
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,105
and to let you know
a little bit about

668
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,908
what we're looking to do.

669
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,479
Sounds good.

670
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,492
If there was one thing--
policy-wise,

671
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,721
you understand, policy-wise--

672
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,232
if there was one thing
that we could do to help you,

673
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,065
to help get you on our side,

674
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,536
what would that
one thing be?

675
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,197
Uh, one thing?

676
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,243
Yeah, policy-wise,
I'm talking, policy-wise.

677
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,212
Whatever you want us to do to
help you with this--

678
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,647
You know, the thing
that you're doing to--

679
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:09,244
to help the... sun.

680
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,713
The sun?

681
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,451
We're talking about things
like stem-cell research,

682
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,857
fetus rights,
oil drilling, gay marriage,

683
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,522
that kind of thing.

684
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,862
See, we are willing
to go far for you.

685
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:26,461
We're willing to go
very far, very far.

686
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:29,097
I mean, we'll even reverse
suffrage if you want.

687
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,800
( chuckling )

688
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:34,971
Well, one thing...

689
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,513
policy-wise,

690
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:39,049
that-- that--
that I would want--

691
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,482
In my district,
people are concerned about

692
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:41,813
prisoner recidivism.

693
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:43,547
Is that
a concern of yours?

694
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,325
Yes.

695
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:51,055
Are you pro-life
or pro-choice?

696
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,337
Do you like babies?

697
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:01,167
Yes.

698
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,729
Yes, yes!

699
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,274
He's pro-life.

700
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:05,707
Somebody write that down.

701
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:11,039
Now, Mr. Katz, all we're
looking to get from you

702
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,208
in return, of course,

703
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,047
is your endorsement
for the midterms.

704
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,461
( knocking )

705
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:25,689
Sir, do you
have a minute?

706
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,754
Bob, I'll call you back.

707
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,156
What's up?

708
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,895
There's someone
I think you'll wanna meet.

709
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,439
Send her in.

710
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,044
Thank you.

711
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,373
All right.

712
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,042
Let me hear your story.

713
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,577
Well, it all
started in a bar.

714
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,856
man: Good afternoon,
Palm Royale.

715
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,360
Hello, I'm Gabe.

716
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,827
How are you doing?

717
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,830
How may I
direct the call?

718
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:03,025
Thank you for taking the time
to connect with me.

719
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,659
I have an urgent
need to connect with

720
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:07,465
my good friend,
Phillip Katz.

721
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:09,233
Phillip Katz,
transferring now.

722
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,172
Thank you.

723
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,403
( ringing )

724
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:14,467
( beeping )

725
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,308
Hello?

726
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,745
Hello?

727
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:21,478
Phillip, it's me, Gabe.

728
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,281
You didn't
forget me, did you?

729
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,151
Thomas: Due to the volume
of calls,

730
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,691
the messiah will not be able to
personally attend to your wish.

731
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:30,352
Please accept the messiah's
gratitude for your call

732
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,692
and have a blessed day.

733
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:35,197
( dial tone )

734
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,325
Hello?

735
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:38,333
Hello?

736
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,377
man on TV:
... 80%f the world,

737
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,280
what many people are
describing

738
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,216
as a good old-fashioned
miracle.

739
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,187
It seems that with everyone's
eyes and ears on Phillip Katz,

740
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:00,986
the sun has continued puzzling
astrophysicists

741
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,822
as to what this latest
release of radiation means.

742
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,886
Scientists the world over are
going back and forth

743
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:08,397
about whether
the sun's core

744
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,263
is shrinking or expanding.

745
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,269
One thing is certain,
the sun is very unstable.

746
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,828
There are no precedents
for these reasons.

747
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,898
It seems all we can do is pray

748
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,068
and hope that our new messiah
has some ideas of his own

749
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,736
about stabilizing the sun.

750
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:23,040
Maria?

751
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,672
Maria: Theological experts
worldwide

752
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,614
are poring over the
copywriter's past work

753
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,982
in an attempt to discern the
significance of anything

754
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,884
from magazine advertisements

755
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:33,082
for toilet-bowl cleansers to
his last television commercial

756
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,715
for condensed oatmeal.

757
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,191
man: All right, thanks, Maria.

758
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,750
Some of you might recognize
Maria Sanchez

759
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,352
from the weekend desk.

760
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,193
She'll be taking over duties
from long-time anchor

761
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,665
Laurel Sanders,
who's on personal leave.

762
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,198
Your indulgences
have arrived, sir.

763
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:50,797
These came in
the mail.

764
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,206
They're from Asia.

765
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:53,174
Really?

766
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,144
How exotic, sir.

767
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,374
There you are.

768
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,882
I hope you're
puckish, sir.

769
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,885
- This may tide you over.
- Thank you, Thomas.

770
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:05,716
Bon appétit.

771
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,052
man on TV:... trying to
catch a glimpse

772
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,751
of our savior-- Josephine?

773
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:10,555
Josephine: Tom, the crowds
outside of this historic hotel

774
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:11,856
have not subsided.

775
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,453
Anything else for you, sir?

776
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,125
- Thomas.
- Your Grace?

777
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,192
She looks so sad.

778
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,601
No one is giving up hope.

779
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,195
Maybe I can help her.

780
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:24,468
Phillip, Phillip, Phillip!

781
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,243
- Hi, how are you?
- Oh, my God.

782
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,184
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God!

783
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,120
I'll leave you to it,
then, shall I?

784
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,081
I'm Phillip.

785
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,820
( screaming )

786
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,626
Are you all right?

787
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:48,824
Sorry.

788
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:49,888
No, no, don't worry.

789
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,332
It's fine.

790
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,494
I like your shirt.

791
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,167
( screaming )

792
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:02,573
I saw you on
the news and I--

793
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,844
You were very beautiful

794
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,612
and you looked like
you were troubled

795
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:12,315
or upset for some reason.

796
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:16,451
And I thought maybe you'd
want to come up here and chat.

797
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,127
What can I do for you?

798
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,498
Bleed on me.

799
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:29,733
( thundering )

800
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:42,946
I've been having this
recurring dream about the sea.

801
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,784
It's one of those lucid dreams
people talk about,

802
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,984
Iike, when you're
awake within your own dream

803
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,052
and you know it's a dream,

804
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:54,859
but you know you're
awake in the dream.

805
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,763
I can't figure out
what it means.

806
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:01,700
People seem to think
that this dream

807
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,741
might have some
significance for the world.

808
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,674
Maybe for the sun thing.

809
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:26,195
Would it be okay if
I invite some friends over?

810
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,329
Sure.

811
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,514
man: Mr. Katz, it's about
the endorsement.

812
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:50,111
We are prepared to
offer you $5 million.

813
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,620
That's weird...

814
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,782
woman: Where's the motion...

815
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,789
( phone ringing )

816
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,490
- St. Mary.
- Who?

817
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,792
Sir?

818
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:04,630
St. Mary of
the Catholic Church.

819
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,101
I've never heard of her.

820
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,660
( phone ringing )

821
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,899
woman: Then after 1:30, you have
a meeting with the ambassador.

822
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,601
Then at 4:00, you have tea
with Prince Harry,

823
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:12,801
followed by...

824
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,344

man: My guest tonight,

854
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:59,805
Jamie Johnson, on a very special
edition of "Sunbeat Now."

855
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,818
First of all,
this is really big news

856
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,854
you're breaking here on
"Sunbeat."

857
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:07,152
You're pregnant with
the messiah's child.

858
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,590
How exciting for you.

859
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,026
I'm just happy to bring
attention to the plight

860
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:15,827
of the single expectant
mother/celebrity/author.

861
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,394
Now, you dated Phillip
before he was famous.

862
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,769
He wasn't even
Phil the Messiah then.

863
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,467
The question everyone
wants to know,

864
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,102
and forgive me for asking,

865
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:30,408
how is Phil the Messiah
in bed?

866
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:35,983
Puta.

867
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,350
- ( giggling )
- Come on.

868
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:40,288
Is he a giver or a taker?

869
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,325
Does he try to
satisfy you

870
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,987
or does he just
take care of himself?

871
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,463
All those intimate details
are in my book,

872
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,432
"Immaculate Deception."

873
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,526
No, you don't.

874
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:53,592
( laughing )

875
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,764
So the messiah in bed...

876
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,407
That's the deception.

877
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:02,138
Glenn, unfortunately,

878
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:05,079
even God doesn't know
how to please a woman.

879
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,111
- Mrs. Katz.
- Mrs. Katz.

880
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,585
Mrs. Katz, you look great.

881
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:12,451
Don't worry.

882
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:13,888
He's gonna love you.

883
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,855
( birds chirping )

884
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,293
( whistling )

885
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,732
( clearing throat )

886
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:33,868
I was told you
wished to speak with me.

887
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,002
Yes.

888
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,843
Hello, I'm Mrs. Katz.

889
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:38,973
Ahh.

890
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,311
How may I be
of assistance?

891
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,874
I'm here to see Phillip.

892
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,852
He's my son.

893
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:46,890
I'm not at liberty to grant
access to his person.

894
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,447
Okay, what room is he in?

895
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:52,256
Madam, I cannot allow the
release of that information.

896
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,797
I want to see my son!

897
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:57,527
( birds crowing )

898
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:58,932
( cell phone ringing )

899
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,265
If you'll excuse me.

900
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,865
Hello?

901
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:06,034
It's me, Josephine.

902
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,010
I need to see Phillip now.

903
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:13,682
If you'll have a drink
in the vestibule,

904
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,844
you never know
what the cat may drag in.

905
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,622
( phone ringing )

906
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,940
- Hello?
- It's me, Josephine.

907
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,635
- I'm outside.
- Outside where?

908
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,940
Outside your door.

909
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,001
- Shit.
- Shit?

910
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,047
Shit what?

911
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:45,547
What shit, what?

912
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:48,210
- I can't let you in right now.
- Why not?

913
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,684
Do you have
a girl in there?

914
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:58,017
Phillip, are you
aware of what's on TV?

915
00:44:58,095 --> 00:45:01,326
If you have an opportunity,
grab it by the balls!

916
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:04,866
I'll meet you
down by the pool.

917
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:12,932
Did you do it,
did you fuck her?

918
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,069
I slept with her once,
briefly.

919
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:16,544
Don't tell me,
I don't want to know.

920
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:17,773
- I have to do the right thing.
- The right thing?

921
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:18,712
I hope you mean
an abortion.

922
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:20,044
You're pro-choice, right?

923
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:21,584
Well, yes,
but not officially.

924
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:22,914
People think you're becoming
decadent.

925
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:24,351
We don't want to
give them ammunition.

926
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:26,582
If this is my responsibility,
I need to get in touch with her.

927
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:27,919
Well, we need to do
an interview.

928
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,288
Something positive,
something upbeat.

929
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,951
People are freaking out
about this sun thing

930
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:32,256
and we need to
give them something

931
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:33,694
simple and straightforward.

932
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:34,788
If you don't
give them a message soon,

933
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,025
you run the very real risk

934
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,761
that they are
going to turn on you.

935
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:39,962
Don't you understand?

936
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,629
I want to
give them a message.

937
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:43,570
I want to have a message.

938
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,107
I want to save
the sun from dying.

939
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,608
I don't know how.

940
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,076
I don't know what to do.

941
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,669
If you don't come up with
something to sell them,

942
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,078
they're gonna think
that you took advantage

943
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:52,911
of this whole sun thing
for your own benefit.

944
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:54,109
Took advantage?

945
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:55,617
I never said
that I was any of this.

946
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:57,176
You're the one that made me
into all of this--

947
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,950
You took advantage of your
position in life.

948
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,514
That was your choice.

949
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:06,324
I didn't mean to,
I just sort of fell into it.

950
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,330
Listen.

951
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:09,365
The message doesn't matter.

952
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,230
It's how you
make people feel

953
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:13,235
about the message
that counts.

954
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,895
Mrs. Katz: Phillip!

955
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,940
They wouldn't let me
through to your room!

956
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,941
I-- I need to talk to you

957
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:21,739
about these
men from Hollywood!

958
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,245
( screaming )

959
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:28,474
Hold on, Mom, I'm coming.

960
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:29,917
No, you can't go out there,
there's a lot of photographers.

961
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,147
- I have to help my mom.
- Hey, Keith!

962
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:32,483
You can't afford any more
bad press right now.

963
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:33,750
She's my mom, I have to--

964
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:35,121
Hey, hey!

965
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:37,558
- Get off me.
- I'm drowning!

966
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:38,822
Don't you know who I am?

967
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,124
- Do you watch the news?
- Throw her a noodle.

968
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:41,528
I'm the second coming of--

969
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:43,532
You are both
going straight to hell!

970
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,965
I want your first
and last names,

971
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:47,060
you are both
going straight to hell!

972
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,105
Get the fuck off me!

973
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:51,801
Glenn on TV: Boffo for
Jamie Johnson's booty,

974
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:54,207
reported to be good for
not six, not seven

975
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:55,870
but eight digits.

976
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,880
Pat on the back
for something she claims

977
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:00,348
to have written in less
than three weeks.

978
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,578
Thomas, I need your advice.

979
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:08,447
Thomas.

980
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:14,627
Do you think that I'm...

981
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:16,996
Lord of all things?

982
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:18,659
Not quite sure that
I'm qualified to make

983
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:21,499
that sort of decision, sir.

984
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,631
I bled from my eyes
in a church.

985
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:26,767
Well, I pissed blood once
after eating bad shellfish

986
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,574
off the coast of Argentina.

987
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:32,979
Didn't seem to grant me
any magical powers.

988
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,347
So you don't think I am?

989
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:35,578
I'm an employee, sir.

990
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,051
I have no opinion.

991
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,348
As the son of God,
I command you

992
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:39,912
to tell me what you think.

993
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,582
I thought it was
the son of the son--

994
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:42,750
Oh, all right, fine.

995
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:43,918
As the son
of the son of God,

996
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,086
I command you to tell me
what you think.

997
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:46,993
Excuse me, sir,
but the point is,

998
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,326
this is a very difficult time

999
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,195
for people living
on the Earth.

1000
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:53,862
There's all this business
of the sun going on right now.

1001
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:57,304
The sun up there, not you.

1002
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,002
Uh, may I?

1003
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,344
( "Hava Nagila" playing )

1004
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,475
Uh, I'm so sorry.

1005
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,782
They're preparing
a bar mitzvah next door.

1006
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:12,219
I'll ask them to turn it down,
shall I--

1007
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:13,654
( music stops )

1008
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,422
Oh, divine intervention.

1009
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:21,258
Phillip, there's really no need
for you to be so worried.

1010
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:24,391
What's happening
to you is nothing new.

1011
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:25,730
You're not the first.

1012
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:27,667
I have concierged
for rock stars,

1013
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:31,606
for film icons,
for football players.

1014
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:34,007
When they can no longer
distract the public

1015
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,978
by throwing a football
or lip-synching a song,

1016
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:39,242
they move on...

1017
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:43,047
and look for someone else
to distract them.

1018
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:47,182
Right now...

1019
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,657
it's your turn.

1020
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:53,162
The world is looking to you
for its distraction.

1021
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,256
But what if
I'm not divinely chosen?

1022
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,960
Chosen, not chosen.

1023
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,969
Does it really matter?

1024
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:01,664
Lead or be led.

1025
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:04,172
Serve or be
served.

1026
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,004
I chose to serve.

1027
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:09,910
Ended up being towels
and cheese, mostly.

1028
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,140
I need to do something
important,

1029
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:13,205
something that
will change things.

1030
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,251
Why not make a speech?

1031
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:16,877
A speech!

1032
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,717
I need to get to work.

1033
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,952
Well, don't forget your
visage de guerre, sir.

1034
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,758
Thank you, Thomas.

1035
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,199
Thank you for
everything.

1036
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:34,032
Thank you, sir.

1037
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:38,031
Ooh, can I have
the ch-- Yeah.

1038
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:39,075
Thank you.

1039
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:43,072
( "Hava Nagila" playing )

1040
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,193
man on TV: Back to our exclusive
special on Jamie Johnson,

1041
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:06,030
mother of the child
of the son of God.

1042
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,732
Hello in there?

1043
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:13,673
What do you want?

1044
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:17,009
She mentions that she never had
a long-term relationship...

1045
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:22,281
Leave me alone!

1046
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,116
For Christ's sake, can't you
all just leave me alone?

1047
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,324
I'm not here for
your son, Mrs. Katz.

1048
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:34,887
I'm here to help you.

1049
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,198
If you have
something to say,

1050
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:40,736
say it before somebody
else does.

1051
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,362
man: Truly amazing.

1052
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:57,677
And who should
I make it out to?

1053
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:00,814
Son of Morning.

1054
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,291
Is that with an "O"
or with a "U"?

1055
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,828
Whatever you feel is right.

1056
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,194
First I want to thank you
for taking the time

1057
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:11,496
to connect with me.

1058
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:15,527
When I listen to you speak,
I feel a sense of loss

1059
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:19,473
and because I have
a need to feel hopeful,

1060
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:22,376
I'm requesting that
you hear my need

1061
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:25,381
and refrain from
spreading your message.

1062
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:26,780
My message?

1063
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,750
Yeah, your example.

1064
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:33,347
You are profiteering off
of a gift.

1065
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,913
Your time's up.

1066
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:36,219
You'll need to buy
another book.

1067
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,590
No, no.

1068
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:41,529
Your campaign of vulgar
opportunism is distracting us

1069
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,931
from the hope that Phillip
brings to all of us.

1070
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:47,094
You can't talk to me
like that.

1071
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,364
I'm famous.

1072
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,134
This-- this is not
your salvation.

1073
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:53,233
This is your destruction!

1074
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,642
Get the fuck out of here
or I'm calling the cops.

1075
00:51:55,712 --> 00:52:00,649
I-- I hear your
requests to feel safe.

1076
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:04,744
My need for you to hear
my pain was not meant.

1077
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:06,686
- Time's up.
- No, no, no, wait.

1078
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:09,850
It's impossible
for us to talk

1079
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:12,190
and listen at the same time.

1080
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:14,594
Do something with your life,
you sad piece of shit!

1081
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:17,724
I apologize on behalf of
your childhood caregivers.

1082
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,234
You are loved,
you are needed.

1083
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,792
- Security!
- No, no, no!

1084
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:21,838
Security!

1085
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:22,894
Just...

1086
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,464
We are not immune to
a disease

1087
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:27,203
of our own creation!

1088
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:28,301
Security!

1089
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:30,437
Give me that,
give me that!

1090
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:34,350
Security!

1091
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:36,078
( screaming )

1092
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,071
( thundering )

1093
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,804
( bell ringing )

1094
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:12,414
Sir, there are some
gentlemen waiting.

1095
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:14,957
They're from the state
attorney general's office.

1096
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,458
They wish to speak
with you.

1097
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,585
Do they have
an appointment?

1098
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:20,687
No.

1099
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,197
Thomas, I really
can't see anybody

1100
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:24,733
until I'm done writing
my speech.

1101
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,632
Hmm.

1102
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,568
man on TV: Here at CCA, we
have Jennifer with the story.

1103
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:30,765
Jennifer?

1104
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,932
Jennifer: Peters'
immediate claim

1105
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:33,600
after the slaying of
Jamie Johnson

1106
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:35,872
was that Phillip had
ordered him to kill her

1107
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:37,504
and her unborn child

1108
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:40,072
in order to attract attention
to Peters' own

1109
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:43,517
nonprofit conflict-
resolution charity.

1110
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,646
Public reaction has
soured overnight

1111
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,690
for the fledgling savior.

1112
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:49,918
Shall I let
the gentlemen in?

1113
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,790
- What?
- I'd rather not get involved.

1114
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:53,351
You don't have to
get involved.

1115
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,864
Just-- just-- just tell
them I'm in the bath.

1116
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:57,559
Mustn't forget.

1117
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:00,360
The owner of the hotel
has rung up.

1118
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:03,668
He's asked me to
leave this with you.

1119
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,037
What is that?

1120
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,684
Oh, shit!

1121
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:20,216
Right, well, I'll just let
the gentlemen in, shall I?

1122
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,349
And then, unfortunately,
I'll have to be off.

1123
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,915
I'm serving
champagne cocktails

1124
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:26,258

00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:28,559

Sir, who are "they"?

More talking gerbil!

1152
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:46,464

1157
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,346
Who are "they"?

1158
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,320
Everybody-- the television,
the Internet.

1159
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:00,583
Everybody.

1160
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,716
Sir, the deposition panel
was formed--

1161
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,089
Yeah, we're not here
to discover

1162
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,650
what everybody else thinks.

1163
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:10,166
We're here to find out what
Mr. Katz believes.

1164
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:13,259
I spoke to the lieutenant
governor, a personal friend,

1165
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:16,464
and he is less than thrilled
with this massive cornhole

1166
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,905
you have dumped on his doorstep.

1167
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:21,375
He has given this
panel judicial authority

1168
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:23,674
and we can hold you
in contempt, boy!

1169
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:25,339
Sir, do you claim to be
someone called--

1170
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:28,873
Are you the Son of Morning?

1171
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:32,581
And, if so, is it "sun" with
a "U" or "son" with an "O"?

1172
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,179
And is it "morning,"

1173
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:35,986
Iike in the "sun" with a "U"
or is it "mourning,"

1174
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,994
Iike in a bereavement?

1175
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:42,691
Mr. Katz, are you
the Son of Morning?

1176
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:47,399
He's not cooperating.

1177
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,370
Were you in any type of
correspondence

1178
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:52,408
with a gentleman by
the name of Gabriel Peters?

1179

No response.

1180
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,143

1181
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:02,673
Gabriel Peters
in question to murder a woman

1182
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,482

No, not that
I'm aware of.

00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:33,774

Jamie Johnson was a fraud.

Hey there, pal.

1232
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,597
How you doing?

1233
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:37,663
It seems from the tests
we conducted and examined

1234
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,173
that you, my friend,
are suffering from

1235
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,700
some highly elevated
levels of cortisol.

1236
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:45,213
What do I have?

1237
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:48,341
Well, in my opinion,

1238
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:52,149
you got one big case
of being stressed out,

1239
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:53,415
clinically.

1240
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:55,116
Not a heck of a lot
more than that.

1241
00:59:58,094 --> 00:59:59,459
So what I'd like to do

1242
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:02,259
is I'd like to get you
on these for awhile

1243
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:03,993
and see how that works out.

1244
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:07,468
Depending on your reaction,
we'll go from there.

1245
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:10,062
I'd like to keep
you for observation,

1247
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:14,901
Okay.

1248
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:16,775
Oh, and, Phillip,

1249
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:19,576
try to find an outlet

1250

Mom?

01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,144
Mom?

1282
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,217
Phillip?

1283
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:08,450
I'm so sorry, I--

1284
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:11,516
I wasn't prepared
for visitors, I...

1285
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:12,891
What visitors?

1286
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:15,396
I would've gotten ready.

1287
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:18,366
I would've
made myself up.

1288
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:23,872
Presentation is five-tenths
of the...

1289
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,635
the thing.

1290
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,505
What are you
talking about?

1291
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,011
Phillip, do you know
Katherine Jayne?

1292
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,842
Katherine Jayne?

1293
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:36,544
It's the Katherine Jayne
disaster supply kit for women.

1294
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:38,849
This is going to improve
the lives

1295
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:42,857
of men-less women everywhere.

1296
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:47,225
It's so that when
something happens bad,

1297
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:51,699
a woman can remain refreshed
and looking her best.

1298
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,861
Feel my skin.

1299
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:56,200
How does that feel?

1300
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:01,770
When did all this happen?

1301
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:06,078
When?

1302
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:08,515
When you were at
your five-star resort,

1303
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:10,142
fantasy hotel

1304
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:14,952
with your fabulous
celebrity friends.

1305
01:03:15,024 --> 01:03:18,425
When I was left here alone
to fend for myself.

1306
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,696
That's when Joyce came here,

1307
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:30,227
and she said that
I would be the best person

1308
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:33,241
to get these supply kits
to women who need them.

1309
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:34,674
More talking gerbil!

1310
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:36,507
You're not the only one

1311
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:38,604
who can save people,
you know.

1312
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:45,921
I'm going to bed.

1313
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:48,320
I'm tired of being
unappreciated.

1314
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:54,794
I need to resolve myself.

1315
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:04,163
Clinically.

1316
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,265
man on TV: In a meeting today
at the global site in Geneva,

1317
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,867
a consensus of the world's
leading stellar scientists

1318
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:10,708
have concluded that the
terrestrial sun's

1319
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,839
recent increase
in flare activity

1320
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:15,475
is actually the result
of a normal cycle

1321
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:18,281
and does not
represent the final stage

1322
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:21,619
in the death of our sun,
as many have believed.

1323
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:49,909
I have something to say.

1324
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:51,817
Okay.

1325
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,378
On television.

1326
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:58,791
You had your chance,
your 1 5 minutes are up.

1327
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:01,591
But I know what
I want to say now.

1328
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:03,928
I have a message.

1329
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,468
Please?

1330
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:07,968
I don't know.

1331
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:10,369
You owe me.

1332
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:14,038
I'm doing this bullshit
piece on sea turtles

1333
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:16,044
at Spanish River Beach.

1334
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:17,511
I could try to
pull some strings.

1335
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,774
I might be able to get you
a few minutes

1336
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:20,816
between traffic
and sports with Fritz.

1337
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:24,984
Thank you.

1338
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:00,482
This is Josephine Tuttle
reporting to you live

1339
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:02,717
from Spanish River Beach
here in Boca Raton

1340
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:03,884
with Phillip Katz,

1341
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,894
who one time,
not very long ago,

1342
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,224
was thought by the majority

1343
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,662
to be man's
last hope for salvation

1344
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:11,529
from fear of the dying sun.

1345
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,931
I have covered
Phillip's story

1346
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:15,095
from the day he chose to
reveal himself

1347
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:17,537
to a small congregation
here in Boca Raton.

1348
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:19,540
There's been some
confusion as to whether Phillip

1349
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:21,803
may have been some kind of
false messiah.

1350
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:23,845
In this live interview,

1351
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:27,679
Phillip Katz will finally
reveal his story to the world.

1352
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,149
- Now?
- Yeah.

1353
01:06:31,954 --> 01:06:34,684
What I've learned,
from my experience,

1354
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:38,523
is that when the world
is about to end,

1355
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:41,791
food tastes better,

1356
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:44,094
fabrics feel softer,

1357
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:47,397
the air
smells better,

1358
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:49,961
dreams seem more real

1359
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:51,939
and people...

1360
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:56,673
People are very strange.

1361
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:59,408
We live in
and are educated by a system

1362
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:03,441
that is supposed to protect us,
but it doesn't protect us...

1363
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,850
( horns honking )

1364
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,753
... distracting us from our
compassionate nature.

1365
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:10,291
But if something
is missing in your life,

1366
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:13,351
you can't look to another
person to fill that void...

1367
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,931
( horns honking )

1368
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:24,068
I can't tell you what
the clam chowder tastes like.

1369
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,904
You have to taste it
for yourselves.

1370
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:31,344
( exhaling )

1371
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:42,648
Gabe: We have tried before,
we have failed.

1372
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,488
But we must try again.

1373
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:50,128
We love to build people up
and then break 'em down.

1374
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:53,032
Maybe it's pointless,
maybe it's justified,

1375
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:56,799
maybe we're just constantly
disappointed in each other.

1376
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:00,103
It's hard to say.

1377
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,375
But hey...

1378
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:07,348
