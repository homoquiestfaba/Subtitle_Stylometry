00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:20,067
[ laughs ]

2
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:25,067
[ screaming ]

3
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:39,067
Daddy, are you  okay?

4
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:45,567
Daddy? Daddy?

5
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:12,567
- Daddy, I-I--
- Everything's fine, my sweetness.

6
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:16,567
[ laughs ]
Now let's get to work.

7
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:22,067
Great idea, Boss.
I am dying for some action.

8
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:53,567
Look, I want to catch
Ransik as badly as you,

9
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:56,567
but we're going to need help.

10
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:04,067
Hey, over here!

11
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:09,567
This is Captain Logan.
Do you read me?

12
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:12,067
- We read you, Captain.
- Where have you landed?

13
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:14,567
We followed Ransik
to the year 2001.

14
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,567
Sir, he's got a whole
prison full of monsters.

15
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:20,567
- We need backup.
- That's impossible.

16
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:26,067
With the Time Ship destroyed,
we can't send any human help.

17
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:30,067
Our weapons are at your disposal,
but the rest is up to you.

18
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,067
You're our only hope.

19
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:37,067
Yes, sir. We won't let you down.

20
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:47,967
- Philips, I hate these things.
- You can't attend

21
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:51,967
an executive meeting
without a necktie.

22
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:54,467
Yeah, well, maybe I shouldn't even...

23
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:59,967
Philips, stop. Stop, stop!

24
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:07,967
I got to go. Sorry, Philips.

25
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:10,967
- Tell them something came up.
- But, sir, I-I--

26
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:14,467
Come back here, sir. Come back.

27
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:19,467
All right, you bolt brains.
Let's blow this joint.

28
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:28,967
You're going to make me kick
your butt again, aren't you?

29
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:30,967
You kicked my butt?

30
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:37,467
Let me jog your memory.
Let's rock.

31
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:40,967
All right. The more, the merrier.

32
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:42,967
I'm glad you feel that way.

33
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:48,967
Well, looky who decided
to crash our party.

34
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:51,167
Destroy him!

35
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,833
Okay, no more.

36
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,533
Get him!

37
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,533
Game over.

38
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:35,233
- Oh, my nail!
- Come on, let's go!

39
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:37,733
- I just painted it, too.
- Move it!

40
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,233
They're going to pay for this.

41
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:42,233
- Come on, Nadira.
- I broke my nail.

42
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,133
It's no big deal.

43
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:48,633
Hey, you've got nine more, right?
Oh!

44
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:52,133
Don't talk to me in
that tone of voice.

45
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,633
But, Na-- ooh.

46
00:05:56,133 --> 00:06:00,133
Hey, ease up. What did
you do that for, anyway?

47
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,133
I had Nadira right
where I wanted her.

48
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:05,633
- I told you to stay out of our way.
- But you need my help.

49
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,633
I told you this is none
of your business.

50
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:12,133
What's your problem?
I'm fighting on your side.

51
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:15,633
You're not fighting at all.
You're playing.

52
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:18,633
This isn't a game for us.

53
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:22,633
You've never had to fight
for anything in your life.

54
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,633
Of course I have.

55
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:36,133
What? Name one thing you've
sacrificed everything for,

56
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:39,133
something that helped
everyone but you,

57
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,133
something you couldn't buy.

58
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:53,633
That's what I thought. Let's go.

59
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,133
Trip, come on.

60
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:17,433
Aah!

61
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:23,933
Those Rangers are going to
spoil our whole plan, Daddy.

62
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:25,933
Ohh.

63
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:33,433
Ah, don't fret, my dear.
[ laughs ]

64
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:37,433
We're going to destroy
the Rangers

65
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:40,933
without even getting
our hands dirty.

66
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:50,433
Ah, the mutant criminals. Perfect.

67
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:51,933
[ laughs ]

68
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,433
Gentlemen, this is the
young man who's going to be

69
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,933
taking my place at bio
synth someday--

70
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:59,933
- my son Wesley Collins.
- Pleasure.

71
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:02,933
- It's nice to meet you.
- Why don't we just go inside

72
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:04,433
and hammer out the
rest of the details?

73
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:07,433
- Please, go ahead.
- Oh, Dad.

74
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:08,933
- Yeah?
- I'll be right in, okay?

75
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:11,433
Don't be long.
This is important.

76
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:21,933
Name one thing you've
sacrificed everything for,

77
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:24,933
something that's helped
everybody but you,

78
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:27,933
something you couldn't buy.

79
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:34,433
Psst. Wes.

80
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:36,933
Come on.

81
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:50,933
- What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you, to explain.

82
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:54,933
No, no. Jen made it pretty clear.

83
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:59,433
She thinks I'm nothing
but a spoiled brat.

84
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:02,433
I don't know. Maybe she's right.

85
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,433
She isn't right.

86
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:09,433
I have ways of knowing.
I'm from the Planet Xybria.

87
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,933
Our gems give us special visions.

88
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:15,433
Here, I want you to see something.

89
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:20,933
- Hey, that's me.
- No, that's-- that's Alex.

90
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:23,933
He and Jen, they were
going to get married.

91
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:25,933
Will you marry me?

92
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,433
That was before Alex
tried to stop Ransik

93
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:33,433
from escaping to the past.

94
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:36,933
Ransik struck him down
without mercy.

95
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:40,933
And Alex was gone.

96
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:45,933
So that's why Jen...

97
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:49,933
- It's all beginning to make sense.
- Wesley!

98
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:54,433
Wesley!

99
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,200
Jen.

100
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,200
- What do you want?
- You were right.

101
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,200
I've never had to fight
for anything in my life,

102
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,700
But now I have
something to fight for.

103
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
I know about Alex.

104
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,700
Unless we stop Ransik
neither of us will have a future.

105
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Please, let me help you.

106
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Time to reverse
the chrono freeze.

107
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,700
The Jatara is ready
for re-animation.

108
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,200
Begin.

109
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,900
The re-animator works perfectly!

110
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,400
Now, go! Go and destroy!

111
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,100
Now let's just see how
tough the cops are in 2001.

112
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,100
- Rangers, we got trouble.
- Circuit's picking up

113
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
signs of mutant DNA at the harbor.

114
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,100
One more chance.

115
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,400
- Ready?
- ALL: Time for Time Force!

116
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,800
- Hyah! Ready.
- Let's do it!

117
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Yeah. Wait.

118
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,300
Time to use the time jet.

119
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,500
Let's hope this works.

120
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Its supersonic speed will
get you anywhere fast.

121
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,600
Come on, let me help you, Rookie.

122
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
Whoa!

123
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,300
He wasn't kidding about
the supersonic part.

124
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,800
This is intense.

125
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,300
So, Wes, do you think
you can handle it?

126
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,300
Piece of cake. Whoo!

127
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,900
Let's go!

128
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,400
Time Force. You're under arrest.

129
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,400
Your days of destruction
are over, Jatara.

130
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,600
- We're bringing you back to prison.
- Not without a fight, Rangers.

131
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,500
Suit yourself.

132
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,000
Chrono-Saber!

133
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,600
Time strike!

134
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,200
- Circuit, what's happening?
- His mutant has been exposed.

135
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,700
This causes him to grow
to a tremendous size

136
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,700
- with more strength than ever.
- Oh, great, now you tell us.

137
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,400
So what do we do now?

138
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,900
That's easy.

139
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,100
Just sit back and prepare
to be destroyed.

140
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,500
[ screaming ]

141
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It looks like he's
attacking the city.

142
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,300
That does it. We need help.
Captain Logan, can you hear me?

143
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,800
We're sending the
Time Force Megazord.

144
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Time Fliers online.

145
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:41,867
Wow! They're incredible!

146
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:46,367
You use your chrono morpher
to dispatch the Time Jet.

147
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:49,367
Right. Time Jet online.

148
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:00,867
Let's go.

149
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:10,667
Time Force Megazord mode blue.

150
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:38,967
Whoa. What do we do now?

151
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:41,967
I'm downloadng the data. Got it.

152
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,467
Guys, we have to all
control it together.

153
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:45,967
Gotcha.

154
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:56,867
I don't believe it.
It's not possible.

155
00:16:56,867 --> 00:16:59,767
You got nothing on us, Jatara.

156
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:03,567
Aah!

157
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:13,667
Concentrate.

158
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:25,667
Aah!

159
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:34,367
- Rangers, go to red mode.
- You got it, Circuit.

160
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:37,267
All right, guys,
let's break it down.

161
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:45,367
Time Force Megazord mode red.

162
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:14,367
Delpoy Saber!

163
00:18:35,267 --> 00:18:36,767
Shields up!

164
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:44,767
- Yeah!
- Wes, try using the saber.

165
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:47,867
I'm on it.
Time Force Megazord Saber.

166
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:53,467
Engage.

167
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:05,967
Aah!

168
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:26,867
Yeah, we did it!

169
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:37,767
Back where you belong.

170
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,167
Power down.

171
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:52,367
- ALL: Power down.
- There's one down.

172
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:58,867
- Glad you captured this guy.
- You mean we captured him.

173
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:02,133
We couldn't have done
it without you.

174
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:09,633
No. Keep it.

175
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:14,633
- Really?
- Yeah. You earned it.

176
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:17,633
