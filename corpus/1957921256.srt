1
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,186
<i>Every day,</i>

2
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,938
<i>we pass strangers around us,</i>

3
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,483
<i>exchanging smiles,
friendly nods...</i>

4
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,820
<i>maybe even a "Merry Christmas"
if we're in the spirit.</i>

5
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,073
<i>And as we smile and
greet that stranger,</i>

6
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,200
<i>you may think to yourself,</i>

7
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,703
<i>"I wonder what
their life is like?"</i>

8
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,830
<i>You might not even
think about it</i>

9
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,165
<i>for more than a moment,</i>

10
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,084
<i>as your paths aren't
likely to cross again...</i>

11
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,337
<i>...yet these complete strangers</i>

12
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,131
<i>would find their
way to one other...</i>

13
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,509
<i>...forming bonds
that, at first,</i>

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,137
<i>may seem unlikely.</i>

15
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,350
<i>Sometimes, we discover,</i>

16
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,769
<i>those bonds may turn out to be</i>

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,438
<i>the very best kind.</i>

18
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,191
There you go!

19
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,567
Are you happy now?

20
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,694
I am.

21
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,278
Now you can play 1/12th
of "Silent Night".

22
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,531
- Wonderful!
- Mm-hmm.

23
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,907
Well...

24
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,450
when we meet our deadline

25
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:02,621
and deliver these paintings
to the Christmas Gallery,

26
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,999
then you can teach me the
other 11 parts. How's that?

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,500
I know you're worried

28
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,877
about us not selling enough
at the gallery to make rent,

29
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,254
but...

30
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,423
God will make a way.

31
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,759
You're right.

32
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,177
Please, God,

33
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,679
let the love of my life

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,640
come over here and help
me finish these paintings.

35
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,684
Amen.

36
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:32,776
Happy first day of
December, Traci!

37
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,195
I got you a little something.

38
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,323
Isn't it a little early
for a little something?

39
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,535
Thought it might
liven the place up.

40
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,996
There's chocolates for each day!

41
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,331
That'll get you in the spirit.

42
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,376
Thank you. I love it.

43
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,961
Is excessive
consumption of sweets

44
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,046
a stage of grief?

45
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,213
Because if so,

46
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,256
then I am really cruising

47
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,674
through that part
of the process.

48
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,426
All right, let's see,

49
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,803
only...

50
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,348
23 more chocolates until our...

51
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,977
my annual Christmas exhibition.

52
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,021
Want to see what
I've been working on?

53
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,189
Mm! Great!

54
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,734
You just wait!

55
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,611
This I like to call...

56
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,071
"Silent Not".

57
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,573
Oh, boy.

58
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,075
Yeah.

59
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,077
And this little,
sweet gem over here

60
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,411
I like to call

61
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,415
"Riding in a Half-Horse,
Open Sleigh".

62
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,001
Okay, Trace, I am
your best friend first

63
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,503
and your manager second...

64
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,796
And while the manager side of me

65
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,464
is a little nervous

66
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,092
you won't be done
for Christmas Eve,

67
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,260
the friend side of me...

68
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,763
understands.

69
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,140
If you need to take
another year off, take it.

70
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,433
No. No.

71
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,852
It's been two years, Joyce.

72
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,271
I have to do this.

73
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,283
I have to figure out
how to work without him.

74
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,569
It's just...

75
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,697
we complemented each other

76
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,031
in...

77
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,032
every way, you know?

78
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,869
I don't know, I...

79
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,413
I see potential here.

80
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,332
I think you can do this.

81
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,961
And I know exactly what
you need to do next.

82
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,295
Plant myself in
front of that easel

83
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,089
until I've finished
my masterpiece?

84
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,882
No, silly...

85
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,259
clear your mind!

86
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,677
I'm taking you
Christmas shopping!

87
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,761
- No!
- Yup!

88
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,097
Yes! 100%!

89
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,140
Can't be sad at the
Christmas market.

90
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,308
It's illegal.

91
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,316
You've just had too much.

92
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,403
I can't help myself.

93
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,237
Hey!

94
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,614
You guys are still here?

95
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,034
Well, we were chatting after
the meeting as usual...

96
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,368
Which then turned into

97
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,870
us getting a three-hour
hot chocolate together...

98
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,121
Which then ended

99
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,956
in me realizing I forgot
my scarf at church,

100
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,166
so we came back here to get it.

101
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,542
I see.

102
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,336
That's when we noticed
our beloved leader

103
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,920
working away here!

104
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,047
You need help?

105
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,381
No, no, no. You guys, no.

106
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,549
Look, I've got it covered.

107
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,217
I think I'm ready to
deliver these boxes

108
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,344
to the women's shelter,

109
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,137
and children's hospital
youth center...

110
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,262
So I'm good.

111
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,305
Hey, Mike, I have a question.

112
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,556
Are you the real Santa Claus?

113
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,350
Give us your best "Ho-Ho-Ho".

114
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,226
Ho-ho-ho, Justin!

115
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,187
Oh, but that wasn't a no.

116
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:13,270
No, No.

117
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,147
Listen... I
appreciate the offer,

118
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,440
I do,

119
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,359
but I really would like
to deliver these solo,

120
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,609
if I could.

121
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,194
All right.

122
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,820
But...

123
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,406
promise us that you will also
do something for yourself.

124
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,369
You spend all your time
helping everyone else.

125
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,537
I know I do, and I will, okay?

126
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,663
Okay.

127
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,831
Now...

128
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,832
I love you guys, but...

129
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,875
let's go! Out!

130
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,043
Okay! We're going!

131
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,586
We're going, we're going.

132
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,838
- See ya.
- See ya later.

133
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,895
Here we go.

134
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,271
Ah, yes.

135
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,233
Come on! Pick any one
you want, my treat!

136
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,526
All right, um...

137
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,069
Ooh! How about that one?

138
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,113
Hmm.

139
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,531
- Oh!
- Oh, I'm sorry!

140
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,740
No, no, no, no! You take it!

141
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,825
Please, I insist.

142
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,993
You touched it one
second before me,

143
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,078
so, technically, you had dibs.

144
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,413
Oh.

145
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,206
So those are the rules
for "dibs" then, huh?

146
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,374
I don't make the rules,

147
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,543
I do enforce them.

148
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,421
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

149
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,172
Two strangers insisting the
other gets what they want

150
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,882
certainly beats the alternative
this time of year, huh?

151
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,884
Oh, you...

152
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,553
you should have seen the
tug-of-war I witnessed

153
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,471
between two moms and a
toy car on Black Friday.

154
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,140
I can only imagine.

155
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,141
Brutal.

156
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,603
You know, you take this.

157
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,564
What?

158
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:38,939
You can have it. I...

159
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,524
I...

160
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,067
I have to go. Yeah.

161
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,820
Have a nice day.

162
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,036
What was that all about?

163
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,246
He looks familiar.

164
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,375
I think he goes to the church
that Greg and I went to.

165
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,919
- Grace Community?
- Yeah.

166
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,338
My memory's fuzzy,

167
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,174
but I think he led a
support group there.

168
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,803
Of course, I haven't
been back since...

169
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,767
You know, when my aunt
passed away a few years back,

170
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,561
I went to a grief-support
group at a local church.

171
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,731
It really helped me.

172
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:21,900
There's just something special

173
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:23,484
about healing alongside others

174
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,027
who are going through
the same thing.

175
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,112
And look!

176
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,114
Grace has one, too!

177
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,576
Thank you.

178
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,786
I just don't think
it's my thing.

179
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,995
I don't.

180
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,082
Besides, I'm feeling
like my old self again!

181
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,166
Yeah!

182
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,544
Joy! Happiness! Fun!

183
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,838
Boop-boop-boop!

184
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:46,917
I'm not fooling anyone, am I?

185
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,802
Who knows.

186
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,514
Maybe it will help you move
past this "painter block".

187
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,015
I'll take this one.

188
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,183
How's that?

189
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,393
It's gorgeous. We'll take it.

190
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,019
All right. Thank you.

191
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,021
Here you go.

192
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,023
Made your favorite...

193
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,317
Pancakes, Christmas-style,

194
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,696
with red and green sprinkles.

195
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,575
Dad, you do know I'm not five
years old anymore, right?

196
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,577
Well, you know what...

197
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,037
they actually
still do the trick.

198
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,039
Thank you.

199
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,708
How's the Christmas
painting coming along?

200
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:24,211
Well, it's not exactly
coming along quite yet.

201
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,047
There is clearly
something missing.

202
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,634
Well...

203
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,469
we think it is so admirable

204
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,637
that you're choosing to carry on

205
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:37,057
the work that you
two shared together.

206
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,310
Maybe you just need
a little inspiration?

207
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,521
My childhood art projects?

208
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,106
Where did you dig these up?

209
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,149
I found them

210
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,026
when I was cleaning
the other day.

211
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:47,359
Do you remember

212
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,861
the very first art show
that you put on for us?

213
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,654
Yes, I was about the same age

214
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,335
as when you used to
make me these pancakes.

215
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,910
Look, it's Freddy Teddy.

216
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,245
Do you remember Freddy Teddy?

217
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,830
I remember Freddy Teddy.

218
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,667
I stood in line for hours
for a "Freddy Teddy".

219
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,252
This is not bad for a kid.

220
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,212
- Not bad at all.
- No.

221
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,421
Try to remember

222
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,048
why you became an artist
in the first place.

223
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,216
To make people feel
something special.

224
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,261
And isn't that what brought
you and Greg together?

225
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,642
I'm sorry, Trace.

226
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,643
I didn't mean to...

227
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,896
No, no, no, no, no.

228
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,481
Dad, it's...

229
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,858
it's okay.

230
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,612
Just some memories just
hit harder than others.

231
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,948
Well, don't forget that
we are here for you.

232
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,950
We are so...

233
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,578
blessed...

234
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,664
that we're your parents.

235
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:46,878
And I am so lucky
to be your daughter.

236
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,788
Are you copying me?

237
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,498
- Oh...
- I'm gonna tell the teacher.

238
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,042
No, no. I was...

239
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,878
admiring the colors
and the detail.

240
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,131
It's a lot better than mine.

241
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,465
I don't know.

242
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,717
I think you're in good shape.

243
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,302
Aw, thank you. I work out.

244
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:42,641
I'm Greg.

245
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,269
Traci.

246
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,218
Traci Fremont!

247
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,096
Patricia.

248
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,514
It's been a while.

249
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,184
Yes! Oh!

250
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,562
It's so good to have you back
for the gallery this Christmas!

251
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,065
We really missed you last year.

252
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,649
Now, Joyce said

253
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,109
she was working on the
press release. How is...

254
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,111
Press release?

255
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,406
Um... I thought you knew.

256
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,699
You are committed, right?

257
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,494
No. Yes, yes, yes! I am. Yes.

258
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,496
Sorry, it just...

259
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,375
Listen, if you're
still not ready...

260
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,626
I am. I am.

261
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:51,836
I just...

262
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,214
I need to make a call.

263
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,133
- Okay.
- Okay.

264
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,064
Joyce, hey.

265
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,776
I was thinking about our
conversation at the market.

266
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,278
What time is that next meeting?

267
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,674
- What's her name?
- Traci, I think.

268
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,883
Yeah, I think so.

269
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,260
So we'll just wait.

270
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,344
Hey, there she is. Hey!

271
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,554
Hey.

272
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:44,514
You... you must be Traci.

273
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:45,931
I am.

274
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,934
We got your email about
possibly joining the group.

275
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,352
I'm sorry. You look
extremely familiar to me.

276
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,395
Have we met?

277
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,272
At the Christmas market.

278
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,481
Remember the ornament?

279
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,482
Oh, yes! That's right. Yeah.

280
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,608
Yeah.

281
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,277
That's very... very funny.

282
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,279
Please! Come on, join us.

283
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,322
Have a seat.

284
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,742
My name is Michael.

285
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:05,284
I'm sort of

286
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,827
the fearless leader of
our little group here.

287
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:07,870
Mostly fearless...

288
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,288
Except when he sees a spider.

289
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,372
Okay, come on.

290
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,457
You should've seen
him the other day...

291
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,042
he jumped, like,
three feet in the air!

292
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:13,334
Okay, well, yes...

293
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,668
And I only did that once...

294
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:15,961
Because the spider
was really big.

295
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,505
It was about, like, that.

296
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,135
So, this is...
this is everybody?

297
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,887
Yes. No, it's...

298
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:25,847
yeah, this is everybody.

299
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,348
We're kind of small but mighty!

300
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,390
Right, you guys?

301
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,017
I'll introduce
you. This is Ethel.

302
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:30,935
Hello.

303
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,186
We have Regina here.

304
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,187
- Hi.
- Hi.

305
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,480
And Justin.

306
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,481
Hi!

307
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,648
Hi.

308
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,901
So, what do you say
we get started, huh?

309
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:39,943
Traci, before every session,

310
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,363
we like to bow our
heads in prayer.

311
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,369
Dear God,

312
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,495
I want to thank you

313
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,996
for bringing us all
together tonight.

314
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,414
<i>The team handling his surgery</i>

315
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,583
<i>is the best there is.</i>

316
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,127
So there's hope?

317
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,130
In his case, in particular...

318
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,422
it's a risky procedure.

319
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,095
I'd be doing you a disservice
if I gave you false hope.

320
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,057
But we've prayed.

321
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,602
Me, our church,
family, and friends,

322
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:14,603
we've prayed.

323
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,273
He'll be okay.

324
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,568
- Amen.
- Amen!

325
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,695
I'm really sorry, everyone.

326
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,030
I, um...

327
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,491
It was nice meeting you.

328
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,084
Traci! Traci!

329
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:40,421
Are you okay?

330
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,463
No.

331
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,924
No, I am...

332
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,092
I thought I was ready.

333
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,301
I'm not.

334
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,054
Look, the hardest part
is just showing up.

335
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,347
Okay?

336
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,308
We just want you to feel
welcome here, that's all.

337
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:53,809
Thank you.

338
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,311
Thank you, but...

339
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,607
I can't. I can't.

340
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,167
Okay...

341
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,713
Good work, partner.

342
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,757
Thank you.

343
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,468
Hey, what do you say
we donate this one?

344
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,720
Yeah. 'Tis the season.

345
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,597
God provided for us

346
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,038
and now we get to
bless someone else.

347
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,143
I love it.

348
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,269
I'm lucky...

349
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,520
that you said yes to
that hot chocolate

350
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,772
all those years ago.

351
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:40,939
Oh, ho, ho.

352
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,982
You're just lucky that place

353
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,568
was stocked full
of marshmallows.

354
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,863
I'm just glad we get to do
this for the rest of our lives.

355
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,074
Mm-hmm.

356
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,202
Mm-hmm.

357
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,225
Excuse me.

358
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:17,309
Oh!

359
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,395
Oops.

360
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:20,813
It's okay.

361
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,649
I have a thousand
of these shirts.

362
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:24,943
Do not worry about
anything, okay?

363
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:26,151
It was my fault.

364
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,236
I shouldn't have snuck
up on you like that...

365
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,488
Especially when you
were in the zone.

366
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,657
- Oh...
- Do you paint?

367
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,866
- I do.
- Wow, really?

368
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:33,992
Yeah.

369
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,119
That's fabulous,
because I could...

370
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,162
use your expertise,
if you don't mind.

371
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,499
I'm looking for the right
paint for toy wooden trains.

372
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,667
Toy wooden trains?

373
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,085
Yeah, yeah.

374
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:43,795
It's something the group
does every year at Christmas.

375
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,212
Oh.

376
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,839
This year, we're providing
toys to the youth center

377
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,881
so they can decorate.

378
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,383
Do our work and stuff like that.

379
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,135
- That's really sweet.
- Thank you.

380
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,512
It kinda even sounds like...

381
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,389
- Fun?
- Fun.

382
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,349
- Fun!
- Yeah.

383
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,933
No, it's a lot of fun, actually.

384
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:58,810
We like to mix things up.

385
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:00,185
I mean...

386
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,104
Talking in a circle is just
one of the things we do,

387
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:02,272
but... yeah.

388
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,441
- Quick recommendation?
- Sure!

389
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,942
- Yes, are you kidding? Please.
- Okay. Great.

390
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:11,363
Um, I would recommend
the non-toxic acrylic.

391
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,323
Okay.

392
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:14,033
Especially since
it's kids, right?

393
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,118
They have every
color imaginable.

394
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,244
I'll just pull some for you.

395
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,662
Ah, this is amazing.
Thank you so much.

396
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,289
Of course! Green, Christmas.

397
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,665
Okay...

398
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,042
It's kind of funny

399
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,209
that we just bumped into
each other again like this.

400
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,627
You know, at first, the market,

401
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,046
then group, then here.

402
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,423
Ooh! Nice catch.

403
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,944
Well, they do say
third time's a charm.

404
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,385
Except that... not so lucky.

405
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,762
Yeah, well...

406
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,555
you know, people do say
it's either luck, or fate,

407
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,140
or God.

408
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,559
Or a complete coincidence.

409
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,894
Thank you.

410
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,230
Well, I don't really
believe in coincidences, so.

411
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,358
- Uh, hey?
- Yeah?

412
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:50,487
I just wanted to apologize
again for the other night.

413
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,573
To be honest...

414
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,784
prayer is tough for me.

415
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,118
I don't know

416
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,799
what I was expecting
walking into a church.

417
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:00,955
Hey, it's okay.

418
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,582
It's fine, it's fine.

419
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,209
My offer still stands.

420
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,419
You know, we'd love to have you,
and no praying required, okay?

421
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,421
All right?

422
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,256
So, how much...

423
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:11,591
No, no, no. It's on me.

424
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,592
Because that's on him.

425
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:15,844
- Thank you very much.
- Yes, of course.

426
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,513
I think the blue actually
does help bring out my eyes.

427
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:18,514
What do you think?

428
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
- Mom?
- Hmm?

429
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,481
What other things was
I good at growing up?

430
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,441
What weren't you good at!

431
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,776
Math, Science,

432
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,405
making necklaces out of
those little candies...

433
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,572
A mathematician and scientist

434
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,324
are probably more
practical careers,

435
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,743
but making candy necklaces
sounds like a lot more fun.

436
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,704
Uh-oh.

437
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:42,788
Has your creative block

438
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:43,956
progressed to the point

439
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,541
where you're considering
changing careers?

440
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:49,420
It's just I kept the
apartment for the art studio,

441
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,798
but now I don't even
want to make art, so.

442
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,300
You might feel that way now,
but you'll get your groove back.

443
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,802
You know, it just takes time.

444
00:18:56,803 --> 00:19:01,766
Or maybe it's time I let it go.

445
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,437
You know...

446
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:10,691
Greg loved talking
about your gifts,

447
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:11,651
your compassion,

448
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:12,818
your...

449
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,778
perseverance...

450
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,573
your knack for helping others.

451
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:21,118
So, before you go make
any big decisions,

452
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,496
think about the
ways that your...

453
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,873
gifts

454
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:26,875
influence your art.

455
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,294
Whoa!

456
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,504
Did Michelangelo design these?

457
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,340
Oh, Dad.

458
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,758
Hey, where are you
going with those?

459
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,676
Well...

460
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,219
I am going to take them

461
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,096
to some people...

462
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,617
who could use a little
Christmas cheer.

463
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,102
That looks great, Ethel.

464
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,395
Thank you.

465
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,689
Thank you for taking the
lead on the trimmings.

466
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,024
You're welcome.

467
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,984
So what do you say
we get started, guys?

468
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,194
Huh?

469
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,612
Yeah, sounds good.

470
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:57,654
It's about time.

471
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:58,906
All right...

472
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,492
Hi.

473
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:07,916
I brought cookies.

474
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,876
I hope I don't
spoil your dinner.

475
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,628
Not at all.

476
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,546
Justin already
spoiled our dinner!

477
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,383
But we always have
room for more.

478
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,051
Well...

479
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,845
technically, they are
"apology cookies".

480
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,013
I am...

481
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,140
I'm really sorry
for running out.

482
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,558
No need to apologize, dear.

483
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,519
We're just happy you came back!

484
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,397
This group is all
about second chances.

485
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,857
Yeah, and third chances,
fourth chances...

486
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:34,858
however many it takes.

487
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,277
Yeah.

488
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:40,155
So, since this is Traci's
official first meeting,

489
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,198
I'd like to remind everybody

490
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,409
this is a judgment-free
zone here.

491
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,743
Speak freely, honestly,

492
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,744
but only if you're led,

493
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,621
and keep in mind

494
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:48,288
that whatever is said here...

495
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,291
stays here. Okay?

496
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,377
I thought we'd start
with some check-ins.

497
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,878
Let's have a seat, shall we?

498
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:55,964
Okay.

499
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:03,595
I took a trip down to
the Christmas market,

500
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:07,976
where Ron and I used to
play Santa and Mrs. Claus.

501
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,146
I didn't stay for very long,

502
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,106
but I...

503
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,734
I did manage to sit
with the discomfort

504
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:17,735
for a little while.

505
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:18,653
That's good,

506
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,446
because I know that you and Ron

507
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,780
have shared a lot
of memories there.

508
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,992
So many happy ones.

509
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,998
<i>Ron was the best Santa
in the whole world.</i>

510
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,124
<i>We married later in life,</i>

511
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,084
<i>so we never had any
kids of our own.</i>

512
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,294
<i>But one year,</i>

513
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:38,005
<i>Ron had the idea to
volunteer as Santa.</i>

514
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,089
Definitely on the Nice List.

515
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,009
<i>He already had
the look down pat.</i>

516
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:45,763
Santa sees a toy
truck in your future.

517
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:46,764
Oh!

518
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,934
What would I do without
you, Mrs. Claus?

519
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,146
Plus the occasional kid

520
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:54,480
that would tug on his beard

521
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,066
to make sure he
was the real Santa.

522
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,151
Yeah.

523
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,570
His beard was
real. It was real.

524
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:03,906
My husband passed away
a couple of years ago,

525
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,033
and...

526
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,248
life has not been the
same since then, but...

527
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,706
the passing of time helps.

528
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:15,752
Especially when you're
surrounded by loved ones.

529
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:17,753
Thank you.

530
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:18,838
Thank you!

531
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:21,131
Thank you. Yeah.

532
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:22,174
May I actually go next?

533
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,175
Of course.

534
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,635
Yeah, I...

535
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,178
I was supposed to stop
by my parents' house

536
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,097
the other night for dinner,

537
00:22:27,098 --> 00:22:28,222
but...

538
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:29,431
I just told myself

539
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:30,599
it would end in
another argument.

540
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,685
So I went back to the bakery,

541
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:33,895
as usual.

542
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,522
I mean, it's just...

543
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:39,525
I think it's just where I
feel closest to Nai Nai.

544
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:40,777
Oh! Nai Nai is my grandmother.

545
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:42,820
Yeah, I've been
running her bakery

546
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:44,238
ever since she passed
away last year,

547
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,990
hence our weekly sugar-rushes.

548
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,909
Thank you.

549
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,537
I dropped out of law
school to take it over.

550
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,873
And that did not go
over well with my dad.

551
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,334
Well, Justin,

552
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:58,961
I know you'll patch
things up with your dad.

553
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,212
You will.

554
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,548
When the time is right, okay?

555
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,426
Thanks. I hope so.

556
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:07,178
Regina?

557
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:10,890
Would you like to
share anything today?

558
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,564
That's totally okay.

559
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:23,111
Traci?

560
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,363
And there's no pressure at all.

561
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:27,574
I feel angry.

562
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:30,909
Okay.

563
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,829
That's all I really want to say.

564
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:36,958
Thank you for sharing.

565
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:43,089
Thank you, all.

566
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:47,426
And the fire alarm in
the kitchen was blaring.

567
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:48,969
When the firefighters showed up,

568
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,721
I was mortified.

569
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,765
I mean, it was my first time
baking all those pies at once.

570
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,975
You know, Nai Nai trusted I
could do it all on my own,

571
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,978
but she probably trusted
me a little too much.

572
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,856
But, you know, she still gave
me another chance after that,

573
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:02,608
and that's what I
loved about her.

574
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,610
She... she embodied the
spirit of forgiveness.

575
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:07,196
I think your Nai Nai and I
would have made fast friends.

576
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:08,197
No doubt about it.

577
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:12,326
I... I have a question.

578
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:13,828
Sure.

579
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,498
Does talking about all this...

580
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:18,874
ever make you feel like

581
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,669
you're just reliving the
pain of the loss of them

582
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,713
over and over again?

583
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,174
I felt a lot of anger, too.

584
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,968
It seemed like everyone
was trying really hard

585
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,012
to say the right thing.

586
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:33,138
I appreciated their efforts,

587
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,723
but I was so angry

588
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,018
that nobody could
really understand.

589
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:39,978
They understand.

590
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,527
So...

591
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:47,945
I just want to say,
before we close tonight,

592
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:50,699
I need to discuss one
small order of business.

593
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,826
Now, I know we all know

594
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,619
that helping others
during the holiday season,

595
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,705
it's a big thing
of what we do here,

596
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:00,332
so we are all volunteering at
the children's youth center

597
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,542
this Sunday

598
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,002
for the Polar Express
Christmas Party.

599
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,671
But we have to all discuss
how we can contribute, so...

600
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:06,839
I've got baked goods covered.

601
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,965
Check.

602
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,216
- I could bring some decorations.
- Love it.

603
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:10,342
I can handle story-telling.

604
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,594
Good. Okay.

605
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,054
There's one thing missing.

606
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:16,255
We need somebody who can
actually help paint toy trains.

607
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,062
Man, I wish we knew somebody
with that skill set...

608
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:29,403
I will be there.

609
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,113
Great! Thank you, Traci!

610
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:32,197
Yes.

611
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,240
All right, session complete.

612
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:34,617
See you all this weekend.

613
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:06,357
Hi.

614
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:07,984
Hey.

615
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:17,326
You seem...

616
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:18,870
happy.

617
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:21,330
Well, why wouldn't I be?

618
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:22,874
Look who's sitting next to me.

619
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:39,264
Traci! Traci!

620
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,225
Hey.

621
00:26:40,226 --> 00:26:41,684
Um...

622
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:43,525
I just wanted to say I'm
glad you came tonight.

623
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:45,396
Oh...

624
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:46,438
All right, listen.

625
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,839
Hit me with it...
First impressions?

626
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,610
Everyone was warm and welcoming.

627
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:54,030
Sorry my contributions
were a bit...

628
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:56,657
minimal.

629
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:57,783
What are you talking about?
No, they weren't at all.

630
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:58,992
There are no expectations, ever.

631
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:00,619
- Thank you.
- I mean, look at Regina.

632
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,912
She's been here for,
I think, a few months

633
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:03,473
and has only said a
couple of words, so.

634
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:05,875
Everybody's at their own pace.

635
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:09,671
So, I will see
you Sunday, right?

636
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:11,715
Paintbrush in-hand.

637
00:27:11,716 --> 00:27:13,049
Hey, I'll keep my distance then.

638
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:17,636
I noticed...

639
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:20,056
that you didn't share.

640
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,767
Sorry?

641
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:24,894
I don't mean to assume...

642
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:27,689
Have you also lost someone?

643
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:32,109
I mean... Yeah, I mean...

644
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,485
You know what, you don't
need to answer that.

645
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:34,528
I should not have
asked you that.

646
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:35,654
It's okay.

647
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,198
No, it's totally
okay, all right?

648
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,324
It's just, as the leader,

649
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,885
I like to put my focus
on everyone else.

650
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,537
But listen, I've got to lock up.

651
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:46,165
I'm glad you came tonight again.

652
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,166
Goodnight, okay?

653
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,710
Yeah.

654
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,338
- I'll see you Sunday?
- Yeah.

655
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,423
All right!

656
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:08,146
Trace?

657
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:12,399
Picked you up some
morning motivation!

658
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,778
Peppermint mocha!

659
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:21,158
How are you so joyful
so early in the morning?

660
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,286
"Joy"... it's right
there in my name!

661
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:26,456
- Hi.
- Hi.

662
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,208
Oh!

663
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:30,085
Oh, no, no, no, no.

664
00:28:30,086 --> 00:28:31,377
It's not there yet, it's not,

665
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:33,379
but at least I was able
to get some work done

666
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,546
after last night.

667
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,632
Oh! After the group, right?

668
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:37,758
How was that?

669
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:38,967
You know what,

670
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:42,012
it... it wasn't
horrible, actually.

671
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:44,139
I mean, I don't know
how much I'll share,

672
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,265
if at all,

673
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:46,600
but it was kind of nice

674
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:47,935
being around people

675
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,063
who understood what
I was going through.

676
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:53,024
I know, I know.
You were right.

677
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:57,277
It seems to be having a
positive effect on your art.

678
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:58,570
I mean, look...

679
00:28:58,571 --> 00:28:59,863
You've gone from half-paintings

680
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:01,240
to three-fourths of paintings!

681
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,576
I think that's called
deadline anxiety.

682
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:06,329
Have you landed on a theme?

683
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:09,499
- Ready for it?
- Mm-hmm.

684
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,627
"Christmas"!

685
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,421
I'm gonna need a
little more than that

686
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:16,797
for the promotional materials.

687
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,716
I'll keep working on it.

688
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:20,968
Okay, well, I'll let you be.

689
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:25,139
Remember, the artists' meet
and greet is next week.

690
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,224
Talking about what you're
planning to present

691
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:28,685
will really help
generate some buzz.

692
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:30,687
Greg used to do that.

693
00:29:30,688 --> 00:29:32,813
Hey...

694
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:34,357
you're not gonna
be alone up there.

695
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:38,361
I'll be right next to
you if you need me.

696
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:40,864
Thank you.

697
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,158
I'm gonna work for
a few more hours,

698
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,827
and then I'm gonna meet
Michael at the youth center.

699
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,078
Michael?

700
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,872
Uh, he leads the support group,

701
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:51,123
and we're...

702
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,166
We're volunteering at
the youth center today.

703
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,250
Great.

704
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:54,501
Oh, wait...

705
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:55,669
He's the guy,

706
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,920
the one from the market,

707
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:57,921
with the ornament.

708
00:29:57,922 --> 00:29:59,256
The handsome one

709
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:01,175
who got all shy around you
like a boy with a crush?

710
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:03,594
I think we're remembering
that moment differently,

711
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:04,762
but yes.

712
00:30:04,763 --> 00:30:06,472
Mm-hmm.

713
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:07,514
What are the odds

714
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:08,975
you'd bump into
him at the market?

715
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:15,398
Maybe that divine meeting
was just meant to be.

716
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:18,359
I don't know that
I really believe

717
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,736
that anything is
"meant to be" anymore.

718
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:22,363
But you know what
I do believe in?

719
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:23,364
Hmm?

720
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:24,656
- Coffee.
- Coffee!

721
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:25,909
- Coffee.
- Coffee.

Yes! Yes!

730
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:00,109
Take five, guys.
I appreciate that.

731
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,777
Thank you, thank you.

732
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:02,946
All right.

733
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:05,949
Regina! Hey!

734
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:08,575
Hi.

735
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:10,953
Any chance we'll
see you back up here

736
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:12,330
one of these Sundays, or?

737
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:14,456
Maybe.

738
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:17,293
The choir isn't the
same without you.

739
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:19,963
I miss you.

740
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:24,467
We miss you!

741
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:29,139
And I know she would
love to hear you

742
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,432
up there again, too.

743
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:36,645
I'll... I'll see you soon.

744
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:37,647
Hey...

745
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:44,820
All right, y'all.

746
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:45,989
Round two!

747
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:54,621
Hello, Michael!

748
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:56,373
Denise, hey!

749
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:57,833
Merry Christmas.

750
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:58,959
So, listen, I've got clothes,

751
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,794
I've got books, I've
got toys galore.

752
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:02,296
Well, on behalf of
me and the kids,

753
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:03,881
it's always very
much appreciated.

754
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:05,341
Well, I appreciate you.

755
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:07,593
Um, I've got to get all
of these boxes in there

756
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:08,886
before the group arrives, so.

757
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:10,804
- Hey.
- Yeah?

758
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:13,515
I'm a little worried about you.

759
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:15,517
Yeah, I'm doing fine.

760
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:16,894
I'm fine. No.

761
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:18,562
I'm just trying to help out
wherever there's a need.

762
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:19,563
Just like Melody did.

763
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:23,192
I've known you and
Melody for years now,

764
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:25,070
so I think I can say this...

765
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:27,780
It seems like you're
trying to atone

766
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:29,532
for something you
had no control over.

767
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:34,328
Denise, I don't know
what else to do.

768
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:35,871
Okay?

769
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:37,664
I know this isn't going
to bring her back,

770
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:39,792
but it definitely
eases the guilt.

771
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:41,670
You have nothing to
feel guilty about.

772
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,131
Well, listen...

773
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:48,218
would you mind helping
me finish all these?

774
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:12,658
♪ Feel the magic once again ♪

775
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,410
♪ It's coming, it's coming ♪

776
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:16,203

778
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,626
- You're getting a workout.
- Tell me about it.

779
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:25,088
Makes up for all those
weeks I skipped leg day.

780
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:29,091
Hey, tell you what...

781
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:30,732
Why don't you and I
do some face painting?

782
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:33,137
And then we give
Conductor Michael here

783
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:34,138
a little bit of a break.

784
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,347
What do you think?

785
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:36,266
All right.

786
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:37,183
All right, come on.

787
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:38,351
One, two, three... Oh!

788
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:40,644
All right, so here's the deal.

789
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:44,398
The key is you just have
to sit super still...

790
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,566
Cookies!

791
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:46,567
There she goes.

792
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:49,612
There goes my subject.

793
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:51,947
Well, you know what,
I'll be your muse.

794
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:53,116
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

795
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,579
- Here we go...
- All right.

796
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,580
Are you ready for this?

797
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:00,790
Yeah. Make me pretty.

798
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,127
All right...

799
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,588
- Okay.
- Okay.

800
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:09,067
You know, you're
really good with kids.

801
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:11,133
How can you not love them?

802
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:13,386
They inspire me to have
"child-like faith".

803
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,264
I guess you're right.

804
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:22,479
All right.

805
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:25,939
This might truly be
my best work yet.

806
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,107
Really?

807
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:28,901
- I mean... yes.
- Drumroll.

808
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:30,362
Pretty amazing.

809
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,448
Ta-dah!

810
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:35,199
Oh! Wow!

811
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,283
Oh, no. I'm not done.

812
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:37,868
I'm going into Vogue.

813
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:38,911
I'm not done!

814
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:39,995
Here we go!

815
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:41,121
Now you're done.

816
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:42,540
Oh, that's...

817
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:46,001
Guys, come look at
Conductor Michael!

818
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:48,253
I mean, look at this.

819
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:49,963
- Rudolph the Reindeer!
- Rudolph the Reindeer!

820
00:34:49,964 --> 00:34:51,383
Rudolph the Reindeer!

821
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:06,189
Those kids had a blast!

822
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,273
I think the more
exhausted we were,

823
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:09,900
the more fun they had.

824
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:10,901
That's a good way of putting it.

825
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:12,027
I'm spent.

826
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:12,946
Listen, guys, I
want to thank you

827
00:35:12,947 --> 00:35:14,029
for your hard work today.

828
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,657
It was such a
special, special day.

829
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:17,867
Good job.

830
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:22,705
Do you want me to
put it over here?

831
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:24,386
No, let's just put all
the stuff down here.

832
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:45,185
The doctor said not to worry.

833
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:47,230
You've got the best
care in the world.

834
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:49,357
How are you?

835
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:53,987
Always putting others first.

836
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:57,407
I love your big,
beautiful heart.

837
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:02,149
At least that's one part of
me that's still in good shape.

838
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,421
I'm gonna be home
before you know it.

839
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:15,507
We're gonna be painting...

840
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:17,385
eating too many
Christmas cookies.

841
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:19,763
Singing in church...

842
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:23,767
Front row?

843
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,394
Best seats in the house.

844
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:31,316
Yeah.

845
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:51,002
"Best seats in the house."

846
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,484
- Hey, Trace!
- Hi!

847
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:18,904
December 15th!

848
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:20,072
Don't remind me.

849
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:22,324
The gallery is neigh.

850
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:23,867
Don't you mean "nigh"?

851
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:27,121
I like "neigh," like
the reindeer would say.

852
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:28,415
'Tis the season, right?

853
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:30,874
Thank you!

854
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,669
Got a front-page ad
for your exhibit!

855
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,795
Oh, man.

856
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:37,716
And top billing on
the gallery invite.

857
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:43,971
"Traci Fremont returns
for a holiday surprise."

858
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:45,055
You're a genius.

859
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:47,224
It'll add intrigue,

860
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:48,934
and give you more
time to pick a theme.

861
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:51,270
Now, don't forget, meet
and greet is on Thursday.

862
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:52,991
Think you could have
it figured out by then?

863
00:37:54,232 --> 00:37:56,859
Traci Fremont's Return...

864
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,403
Is Neigh."

865
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:01,989
- Yeah.
- I'll keep working on it.

866
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,033
Okay.

867
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,000
Oh...

868
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:14,169
it all looks so good.

869
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:18,213
How much for one of everything?

870
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:19,298
Traci?

871
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:20,841
After all your stories,

872
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:22,760
I feel like I'm visiting
a historical landmark.

873
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:25,137
Yeah. Well, in a way,
it kind of is one.

874
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:26,722
Are you headed to group soon?

875
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:27,640
Yeah.

876
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:29,183
I just gotta put
some stuff away.

877
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:30,704
Did you... Did you
wanna walk together?

878
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:32,603
I would love that.

879
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:33,854
Cool.

880
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:35,648
Ooh, one last thing.

881
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:38,901
Compliments of the chef.

882
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:39,943
How can I resist?

883
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:40,945
Let me see...

884
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:43,364
Maybe this.

885
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:44,324
Best choice.

886
00:38:44,325 --> 00:38:45,492
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

887
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:51,705
Mm...

888
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:52,998
Mm!

889
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:56,502
Wait, is this chocolate
inside a chocolate donut

890
00:38:56,503 --> 00:38:58,420
with chocolate frosting
and chocolate sprinkles?

891
00:38:58,421 --> 00:38:59,630
Oh, yeah!

892
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:01,965
That is Nai Nai's
quadruple chocolate donut.

893
00:39:01,966 --> 00:39:03,342
It's about a week's
worth of calories.

894
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:04,302
Worth it.

895
00:39:04,303 --> 00:39:05,595
That's what they say.

896
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:08,305
Now...

897
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:09,557
has your dad tried this?

898
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:12,101
He...

899
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:13,477
won't even set foot in here.

900
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:16,563
I think if your dad could
see, or, rather, taste,

901
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:19,024
how talented you are...

902
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:20,067
he'd be more supportive.

903
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:21,193
Right.

904
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:22,945
But...

905
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:25,146
that would just require us
to have a conversation first.

906
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:27,617
I'll be right back.

907
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,955
For sure...

908
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:34,081
Um...

909
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:35,124
I'll see you in there.

910
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:36,458
Oh, do you mind taking this?

911
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:37,836
Thanks.

912
00:39:40,213 --> 00:39:41,413
"The Best Seats in the House".

913
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:43,133
Hey.

914
00:39:43,134 --> 00:39:44,383
Hey!

915
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,011
I'm sorry, what was that?

916
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:49,346
That's what Greg always
called the front row...

917
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:50,306
"The Best Seats in the House".

918
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:51,266
Oh, right.

919
00:39:51,267 --> 00:39:52,516
Well...

920
00:39:52,517 --> 00:39:53,476
he definitely wasn't wrong.

921
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:54,977
I'm sorry, I'm interrupting...

922
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:56,228
No, no, no, no.

923
00:39:56,229 --> 00:39:57,688
No. You're not interrupting
at all, actually.

924
00:39:57,689 --> 00:39:59,023
I just...

925
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:00,482
I always come here early
to pray for the group, so.

926
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:01,651
Any requests?

927
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:05,196
Where does one begin?

928
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:08,157
You know, I have a...

929
00:40:08,158 --> 00:40:09,366
- a deadline...
- Hmm.

930
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:10,993
And no idea what to present.

931
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:12,786
So...

932
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:13,787
a miracle?

933
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:15,999
A miracle it is.

934
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:25,549
Do you ever wonder if it...

935
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,760
if it doesn't work?

936
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:31,180
Hmm.

937
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:33,682
You know, I think...

938
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:35,726
I think a small degree
of doubt is normal.

939
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:39,521
But I also believe that God
answers prayers sometimes

940
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:40,899
in ways we don't expect.

941
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,902
Hmm.

942
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:47,697
I stopped praying.

943
00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:50,407
When I lost him.

944
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:54,370
It just...

945
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:55,537
feels so wrong to say that.

946
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:56,915
Hey, hey, hey...

947
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:00,084
it's not.

948
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:02,712
It's normal.

949
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:05,632
It's honest.

950
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:07,841
And it's honest.

951
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:08,968
Yes.

952
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:13,681
I hope I wasn't being rude

953
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:15,724
whenever I asked you if
you had lost someone.

954
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:16,685
No.

955
00:41:16,686 --> 00:41:18,435
No, you weren't rude at all.

956
00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:19,646
It's okay.

957
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,857
The truth is...

958
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:27,112
I have lost someone.

959
00:41:28,446 --> 00:41:30,115
- I'm really sorry.
- That's okay.

960
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:33,909
We don't have to talk
about it. Honestly, I...

961
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,036
I couldn't really
help you anyway.

962
00:41:36,037 --> 00:41:40,582
I mean, my faith is
not exactly sturdy, so.

963
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:43,085
Well, in that case...

964
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:44,628
You know, God says

965
00:41:44,629 --> 00:41:46,691
all you need is to have faith
the size of a mustard seed.

966
00:41:46,715 --> 00:41:48,115
I have a feeling
you have that much.

967
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:54,973
Why do you think things
like this happen?

968
00:41:57,475 --> 00:41:58,977
I think it's a reminder.

969
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,564
To always live each
day to the fullest,

970
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:06,608
but also I think it's a way

971
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:09,236
for Him to show us...

972
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:11,906
how He restores and heals us.

973
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,160
And all we have to do is pray.

974
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:24,460
Great photos, guys.

975
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:26,004
I really love seeing
what you did here.

976
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:30,008
I think I'm ready to share.

977
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:35,054
Okay.

978
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:37,264
Um...

979
00:42:37,265 --> 00:42:40,517
my husband, Greg, and
I met six years ago

980
00:42:40,518 --> 00:42:41,936
in art class.

981
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:46,358
My parents said that we were
a "match made in heaven".

982
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,693
So, we got married,

983
00:42:49,694 --> 00:42:52,154
and I felt like

984
00:42:52,155 --> 00:42:54,449
God gave me everything I
could have ever wanted.

985
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:56,910
Yeah.

986
00:42:58,244 --> 00:43:00,038
Until I lost it all.

987
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:06,086
Greg had a brain tumor.

988
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:10,381
The doctors tried,

989
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:12,050
but...

990
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:16,429
I miss him every day.

991
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:22,101
You know, Traci,

992
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:24,061
that takes...

993
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:25,939
a lot of courage to
open up like that.

994
00:43:27,273 --> 00:43:29,234
I hope you believe
me when I say this...

995
00:43:30,735 --> 00:43:32,055
that's what healing looks like.

996
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:36,198
Can we pray for you?

997
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:37,325
Yeah.

998
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:41,328
Yeah.

999
00:43:47,585 --> 00:43:49,105
Heavenly Father, I
want to thank you...

1000
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,881
for a wonderful day.

1001
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:54,883
But also for a day

1002
00:43:54,884 --> 00:43:56,051
where you showed us

1003
00:43:56,052 --> 00:43:57,344
that,

1004
00:43:57,345 --> 00:43:59,263
even within our grief,

1005
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:01,266
we can find joy.

1006
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:05,769
As we leave this place today,

1007
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,355
bless us...

1008
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:11,234
and comfort us.

1009
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:17,573
I don't think I can do this.

1010
00:44:17,574 --> 00:44:19,450
Just be yourself!

1011
00:44:19,451 --> 00:44:21,618
You really want me to do that?

1012
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:22,786
I haven't finished my art,

1013
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:23,787
I don't have a theme,

1014
00:44:23,788 --> 00:44:24,997
and I clam up

1015
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:26,457
when talking in front of people.

1016
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:28,292
Your art will be finished,

1017
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:30,794
you can tease them with
the element of surprise,

1018
00:44:30,795 --> 00:44:33,797
and, most importantly,
you're here.

1019
00:44:33,798 --> 00:44:35,216
Okay? You'll be fine.

1020
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:38,677
Ladies and gentlemen,

1021
00:44:38,678 --> 00:44:40,387
may I have your
attention, please?

1022
00:44:40,388 --> 00:44:41,847
Thank you for coming

1023
00:44:41,848 --> 00:44:44,475
to the pre-gallery
artist meet and greet!

1024
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:49,314
Let's start with our
very own Traci Fremont!

1025
00:44:56,863 --> 00:44:58,114
Hey, everyone.

1026
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:01,534
Um, it's good to see you again.

1027
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:06,373
You may have noticed
I'm here solo.

1028
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:12,336
Two years ago, I lost
my husband, Greg.

1029
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:14,046
Now he would, you know,

1030
00:45:14,047 --> 00:45:18,050
probably warm you all up
with a really great joke.

1031
00:45:18,051 --> 00:45:20,136
I don't have one of
those in my pocket.

1032
00:45:26,601 --> 00:45:27,643
To be honest,

1033
00:45:27,644 --> 00:45:29,020
it has just been... it's hard.

1034
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:31,398
It's been really hard.

1035
00:45:33,274 --> 00:45:36,026
When you feel like
half of you is missing,

1036
00:45:36,027 --> 00:45:37,653
how do you move forward?

1037
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:38,654
You know?

1038
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:45,119
So...

1039
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,205
you are going to
see a new version

1040
00:45:48,206 --> 00:45:50,083
of the Fremont series this year.

1041
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:53,378
One of...

1042
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:55,130
resilience...

1043
00:45:57,257 --> 00:45:58,258
and healing.

1044
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:01,885
And it's probably
going to be messy,

1045
00:46:01,886 --> 00:46:03,430
because that's life...

1046
00:46:05,598 --> 00:46:06,682
but I really do believe

1047
00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:09,519
that that's where
true beauty is found.

1048
00:46:11,938 --> 00:46:14,189
So I hope you come and
check out my exhibit.

1049
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,191
Thank you.

1050
00:46:22,657 --> 00:46:24,075
What. Was. That.

1051
00:46:25,618 --> 00:46:26,827
I don't know what came over
me, it just kinda spilled out.

1052
00:46:26,828 --> 00:46:28,579
And it was amazing!

1053
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,289
- Really?
- Yes!

1054
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,415
The perfect way

1055
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:32,624
to channel your
feelings into your work!

1056
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:33,709
You hit a home run.

1057
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:35,044
I almost ran out of here.

1058
00:46:35,045 --> 00:46:37,087
You managed to pull it together.

1059
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:40,133
It was a Christmas
miracle, perhaps?

1060
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:42,217
Whatever it was, it worked.

1061
00:46:42,218 --> 00:46:43,677
It was the support
group, wasn't it?

1062
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:45,471
I knew it! I'm always right!

1063
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,139
Calm down.

1064
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,099
You're giving yourself just
a little bit too much credit.

1065
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,934
Oh, I don't know.

1066
00:46:50,935 --> 00:46:52,729
I think someone is
looking out for you.

1067
00:47:01,654 --> 00:47:05,783

1073
00:47:34,896 --> 00:47:35,938
Hi, sweetie.

1074
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:37,564
- Hi!
- Hi!

1075
00:47:37,565 --> 00:47:38,732
Wow!

1076
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:39,983
Who did you hire

1077
00:47:39,984 --> 00:47:41,860
to make this place
all sparkly and shiny?

1078
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:43,987
Well, I did it all by myself.

1079
00:47:43,988 --> 00:47:46,199
With the help of five
to six cups of coffee.

1080
00:47:47,701 --> 00:47:49,076
Well, we brought you some sweets

1081
00:47:49,077 --> 00:47:50,411
to fuel your work.

1082
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:51,537
Oh!

1083
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:52,621
Just keep them away
from your father.

1084
00:47:52,622 --> 00:47:53,747
Mm-hmm.

1085
00:47:53,748 --> 00:47:55,749
Hey, I had a carrot yesterday!

1086
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,543
And it wasn't even in a cake.

1087
00:47:57,544 --> 00:47:58,585
Oh.

1088
00:47:58,586 --> 00:47:59,754
Well, I'm very proud of you.

1089
00:48:02,924 --> 00:48:04,842
Huh.

1090
00:48:04,843 --> 00:48:05,884
Something tells me

1091
00:48:05,885 --> 00:48:06,927
that you guys
didn't just stop by

1092
00:48:06,928 --> 00:48:08,555
to give me some sweets.

1093
00:48:10,306 --> 00:48:11,765
We heard about
your support group.

1094
00:48:11,766 --> 00:48:13,268
Ah, Joyce.

1095
00:48:14,227 --> 00:48:15,477
We think it's wonderful

1096
00:48:15,478 --> 00:48:16,520
that you're getting
yourself back out there,

1097
00:48:16,521 --> 00:48:18,355
and we want to
hear all about it!

1098
00:48:18,356 --> 00:48:20,441
Who's this Michael fella anyway?

1099
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:21,859
Okay, Dad.

1100
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:22,819
He's just a friend.

1101
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,237
Friends are good.

1102
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:26,406
Yes...

1103
00:48:26,407 --> 00:48:28,241
friends have been really good.

1104
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:34,621
- Hey!
- Hey!

1105
00:48:34,622 --> 00:48:35,706
This was on your door.

1106
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:36,791
Thank you!

1107
00:48:37,792 --> 00:48:39,294
So much.

1108
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:43,547
Well, this is interesting.

1109
00:48:43,548 --> 00:48:44,715
What?

1110
00:48:44,716 --> 00:48:45,883
A text from Michael.

1111
00:48:45,884 --> 00:48:47,009
He says, "Meet me in
front of the church

1112
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,052
tomorrow at 5:00 a.m.

1113
00:48:48,053 --> 00:48:49,345
And dress warm!"

1114
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:50,512
Thank you.

1115
00:48:50,513 --> 00:48:52,056
Winky face.

1116
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:53,307
Winky face, huh?

1117
00:48:53,308 --> 00:48:54,558
Yeah...

1118
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:55,602
It's to the whole group.

1119
00:48:57,437 --> 00:48:58,979
Well, I wonder what
he has planned.

1120
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,939
It better be good.

1121
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,107
5:00 a.m.?

1122
00:49:03,693 --> 00:49:05,569
What's his story anyway?

1123
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:06,570
I don't know.

1124
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:07,613
He hasn't told me it,

1125
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:09,324
but I'm sure he will
when he's ready.

1126
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:13,577
Good Morning, everyone!

1127
00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:15,662
Who's ready for a winter
wonderland adventure?

1128
00:49:15,663 --> 00:49:16,914
I'm ready for a nap.

1129
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:18,123
I second that.

1130
00:49:18,124 --> 00:49:19,917
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1131
00:49:19,918 --> 00:49:21,127
- Here you go.
- Lifesaver.

1132
00:49:22,128 --> 00:49:23,420
Let me guess, you're
not a morning person?

1133
00:49:23,421 --> 00:49:24,838
I'm about to be.

1134
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:27,174
All right, I am your
tour guide this morning

1135
00:49:27,175 --> 00:49:29,510
as we head to a very
special location.

1136
00:49:29,511 --> 00:49:30,761
Thank you.

1137
00:49:30,762 --> 00:49:32,180
All aboard!

1138
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:35,599
- You're in?
- Yeah.

1139
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,810
Groovy.

1140
00:49:46,027 --> 00:49:47,736
I know it's early and
it's dark outside, guys,

1141
00:49:47,737 --> 00:49:48,946
but trust me,

1142
00:49:48,947 --> 00:49:50,072
if you look outside the window,

1143
00:49:50,073 --> 00:49:51,825
you'll see this gorgeous...

1144
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:00,666
Okay.

1145
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:02,168
Night-night, guys.

1146
00:50:03,503 --> 00:50:04,703
How about you?
You still awake?

1147
00:50:08,508 --> 00:50:09,467
You all right?

1148
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:11,677
Yeah... yeah.

1149
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:13,137
Just thinking.

1150
00:50:13,138 --> 00:50:15,305
Well, I'll tell you what...

1151
00:50:15,306 --> 00:50:18,309
I bet I can make you laugh
by the end of this trip.

1152
00:50:23,023 --> 00:50:23,940
What are the stakes?

1153
00:50:23,941 --> 00:50:25,607
Ooh.

1154
00:50:25,608 --> 00:50:26,692
Okay.

1155
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:27,943
You drive a hard
bargain there, Traci.

1156
00:50:27,944 --> 00:50:29,319
The stakes are...

1157
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,613
the loser buys the winner

1158
00:50:31,614 --> 00:50:33,824
a dozen sweet treats
of their choice

1159
00:50:33,825 --> 00:50:34,825
from Nai Nai's bakery.

1160
00:50:34,826 --> 00:50:36,910
What do you think?

1161
00:50:36,911 --> 00:50:38,371
Deal.

1162
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:40,540
You're on.

1163
00:50:56,556 --> 00:50:57,848
Well, we're almost
there, you guys.

1164
00:50:57,849 --> 00:50:59,308
Hey, listen,

1165
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:00,727
I want to discuss
this week's theme.

1166
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:03,562
"Finding Peace".

1167
00:51:03,563 --> 00:51:05,064
What better way
to experience that

1168
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:06,232
than in nature, right?

1169
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:08,192
What's our task?

1170
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:09,568
You don't have a task, Ethel.

1171
00:51:09,569 --> 00:51:10,694
As a matter of fact,
none of you do.

1172
00:51:10,695 --> 00:51:11,695
All I want you to do...

1173
00:51:11,696 --> 00:51:13,947
stay in the moment.

1174
00:51:13,948 --> 00:51:15,407
If you have a memory or thought,

1175
00:51:15,408 --> 00:51:17,201
let it be there,
make room for it.

1176
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:18,370
That's it.

1177
00:51:29,255 --> 00:51:30,631
Okay.

1178
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:32,512
Yeah, now I see why you
got us up here so early.

1179
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:34,844
Right?

1180
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:37,972
This is where I
feel closest to God.

1181
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:40,433
Right here.

1182
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:42,518
The stillness, the quiet...

1183
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:44,396
the closer proximity to Heaven.

1184
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:47,481
It's a place you can look out

1185
00:51:47,482 --> 00:51:49,002
and see something
bigger than yourself.

Music was everything to us.

1207
00:53:23,536 --> 00:53:25,955
I lost her only a
couple of months ago.

1208
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:29,917
My mother,

1209
00:53:29,918 --> 00:53:30,918
my singing partner...

1210
00:53:32,587 --> 00:53:34,171
and...

1211
00:53:34,172 --> 00:53:36,924
when I lost her,

1212
00:53:36,925 --> 00:53:38,425
I...

1213
00:53:38,426 --> 00:53:39,886
also lost my voice.

1214
00:53:43,723 --> 00:53:44,516
But now, it's...

1215
00:53:44,517 --> 00:53:46,726
it's like she's here.

1216
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:51,523
I love you.

1217
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:00,448
That was beautiful.

1218
00:54:02,617 --> 00:54:03,618
Regina...

1219
00:54:04,744 --> 00:54:05,869
you okay?

1220
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:06,871
Yeah, I'm okay.

1221
00:54:08,915 --> 00:54:09,957
Um...

1222
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:11,501
I think I'm ready
to go back down now.

1223
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,420
- Thank you for sharing.
- Yeah, thanks.

1224
00:54:14,421 --> 00:54:15,755
I'm proud of you.

1225
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:28,935
Wow.

1226
00:54:30,228 --> 00:54:31,395
She's come so far.

1227
00:54:31,396 --> 00:54:33,023
You helped make that happen.

1228
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:36,984
Speaking of help...

1229
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:38,235
You okay?

1230
00:54:38,236 --> 00:54:40,654
No, my back... getting old here.

1231
00:54:40,655 --> 00:54:42,072
Think you could carry
me down to the...

1232
00:54:42,073 --> 00:54:43,033
I got you!

1233
00:54:43,034 --> 00:54:44,366
- No!
- No, no!

1234
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:45,617
I got you. You owe me.

1235
00:54:45,618 --> 00:54:47,418
- That does not count.
- Of course, it counts.

1236
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:49,288
Made you laugh. Like
I told you I would.

1237
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:50,622
Tricky.

1238
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,916
Fine!

1239
00:54:52,917 --> 00:54:54,251
Oh!

1240
00:54:54,252 --> 00:54:55,461
And trust me,

1241
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:56,254
I'm not going to have
you get me any treats,

1242
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,255
or anything like that.

1243
00:54:57,256 --> 00:54:58,714
Instead, I...

1244
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:00,132
Instead...

1245
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:01,800
you know, I didn't know
if you might want to...

1246
00:55:01,801 --> 00:55:03,470
might want to be my
partner at the...

1247
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:06,139
gift-wrapping contest.

1248
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:10,477
Like, a date?

1249
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:13,521
Uh...

1250
00:55:14,647 --> 00:55:15,814
yeah, I mean, I don't know...

1251
00:55:15,815 --> 00:55:17,609
Well, yeah, I could
call it a date, or...

1252
00:55:18,818 --> 00:55:20,487
or not, or...

1253
00:55:21,613 --> 00:55:22,613
Can I think about it?

1254
00:55:22,614 --> 00:55:24,365
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1255
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:25,574
Okay, I'm gonna just...

1256
00:55:25,575 --> 00:55:26,868
- catch up.
- Okay.

1257
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:42,341
Everything okay, honey?

1258
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:44,511
Yeah, yeah. Why?

1259
00:55:45,845 --> 00:55:49,264
Well, you've been twirling
that same piece of spaghetti

1260
00:55:49,265 --> 00:55:51,017
for 10 minutes.

1261
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:57,731
Michael asked me on a date.

1262
00:55:57,732 --> 00:55:59,025
I mean, I think it was a date.

1263
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:02,236
I don't know...

1264
00:56:02,237 --> 00:56:03,362
That's great!

1265
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:04,988
Great?

1266
00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:05,740
From what we've heard,

1267
00:56:05,741 --> 00:56:07,700
he's an upstanding man.

1268
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:09,159
He is.

1269
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,662
He's a really nice guy.

1270
00:56:11,871 --> 00:56:14,498
But...

1271
00:56:14,499 --> 00:56:15,792
what about Greg?

1272
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:19,461
So, what, am I just
supposed to forget him

1273
00:56:19,462 --> 00:56:20,797
and move on?

1274
00:56:23,508 --> 00:56:24,925
I don't think I can do that.

1275
00:56:24,926 --> 00:56:27,929
No one's asking you
to forget about Greg.

1276
00:56:30,056 --> 00:56:31,140
But he...

1277
00:56:31,141 --> 00:56:32,017
he would want you to be happy,

1278
00:56:32,018 --> 00:56:33,767
no matter what.

1279
00:56:33,768 --> 00:56:34,769
Yes.

1280
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:37,312
I know that you are afraid

1281
00:56:37,313 --> 00:56:39,941
to open your heart again.

1282
00:56:41,526 --> 00:56:43,986
But if there's a
little part of you

1283
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:46,740
that thinks maybe
it's time to try...

1284
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:49,935
maybe that's what you should do.

1285
00:56:53,913 --> 00:56:55,205
One small step...

1286
00:56:55,206 --> 00:56:57,541
or a date...

1287
00:56:57,542 --> 00:56:58,710
at a time.

1288
00:57:34,537 --> 00:57:36,080
You still need a partner?

1289
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:37,289
Oh, hey.

1290
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:38,708
Yeah, I would...
I would love one.

1291
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:43,004
So, what was your
plan if I didn't show?

1292
00:57:44,047 --> 00:57:44,798
My plan was,

1293
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,256
I was gonna use each hand

1294
00:57:46,257 --> 00:57:48,676
to wrap each one of these
presents separately,

1295
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:50,052
and then I thought, you
know, that's not good...

1296
00:57:50,053 --> 00:57:51,178
But anyway, I thought
it might work,

1297
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:52,346
but obviously, it's not.

1298
00:57:52,347 --> 00:57:53,722
Now, listen, I knew
you were gonna come.

1299
00:57:53,723 --> 00:57:55,643
I knew you'd show up. It's
nice to see you laugh.

1300
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:58,811
- So we're wrapping this?
- Yes.

1301
00:57:58,812 --> 00:58:00,896
How does one wrap a bicycle
without it looking ridiculous?

1302
00:58:00,897 --> 00:58:02,272
Well, you know,
it's an art form.

1303
00:58:02,273 --> 00:58:04,817
Don't worry. You'll catch
on. Just follow my lead.

1304
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:06,568
All right wrappers,
are you ready?

1305
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:08,487
- Yes!
- Yes!

1306
00:58:08,488 --> 00:58:11,323
Time is important,
but aesthetic is key.

1307
00:58:11,324 --> 00:58:13,826
These gifts will be donated
to the homeless shelter,

1308
00:58:13,827 --> 00:58:16,328
but our winners will not
go away empty-handed,

1309
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:18,372
because you're playing for...

1310
00:58:18,373 --> 00:58:20,332
an all-expense-paid ski trip

1311
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:21,709
to Murray's Lodge!

1312
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:23,043
- Whoa!
- What?

1313
00:58:23,044 --> 00:58:24,045
Nice, huh?

1314
00:58:25,588 --> 00:58:26,630
Don't worry, when we
win, we'll go as friends.

1315
00:58:26,631 --> 00:58:27,799
When we win?

1316
00:58:28,717 --> 00:58:30,342
- Really?
- I like your confidence.

1317
00:58:30,343 --> 00:58:31,343
Well...

1318
00:58:31,344 --> 00:58:32,386
On your mark...

1319
00:58:32,387 --> 00:58:33,512
- Ready?
- All right.

1320
00:58:33,513 --> 00:58:35,681
Get set,

1321
00:58:35,682 --> 00:58:36,974

I felt so bad for
Richard and Maria.

1343
00:59:35,575 --> 00:59:37,034
Why?

1344
00:59:37,035 --> 00:59:38,494
Well, because they were much
faster than us, come on.

1345
00:59:38,495 --> 00:59:39,912
Don't feel bad for those two.

1346
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:42,247
Come on, they've won it
the last 30 years in a row.

1347
00:59:42,248 --> 00:59:43,540
- What?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1348
00:59:43,541 --> 00:59:44,875
Not to mention, I think...

1349
00:59:44,876 --> 00:59:46,396
they're a little too
proud, by the way.

1350
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:52,084
Thanks for coming by the way.

1351
00:59:52,926 --> 00:59:53,926
I probably should be working,

1352
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:56,345
but I'm... I'm
really glad I came.

1353
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:57,638
It was fun.

1354
00:59:57,639 --> 01:00:00,265
- Yeah, it was, wasn't it?
- Yeah!

1355
01:00:00,266 --> 01:00:01,184
What do you say

1356
01:00:01,185 --> 01:00:03,144
we procrastinate
a little longer?

1357
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:05,980
I'd say I'd love that.

1358
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:12,821
It's a different kind of
beautiful at night, huh?

1359
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,662
Melody loved coming down here...

1360
01:00:21,663 --> 01:00:22,788
at night

1361
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:24,332
and looking up at the stars.

1362
01:00:29,587 --> 01:00:30,839
Can I tell you about her?

1363
01:00:32,424 --> 01:00:33,424
Are you kidding?

1364
01:00:35,176 --> 01:00:37,136
I've been waiting
weeks for this moment.

1365
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:38,847
Please.

1366
01:00:52,444 --> 01:00:53,445
Overpack for the hike?

1367
01:00:54,487 --> 01:00:56,447
Uh, yeah, yeah.

1368
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:57,823
Yeah, that would... That
would be an understatement,

1369
01:00:57,824 --> 01:00:59,283
wouldn't it?

1370
01:00:59,284 --> 01:01:00,743
I've seen a lot of first-timers
make the same mistake.

1371
01:01:00,744 --> 01:01:01,952
Well, the funny thing is, I
think I brought everything,

1372
01:01:01,953 --> 01:01:03,329
I just think I forgot...

1373
01:01:04,706 --> 01:01:05,582
Water?

1374
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:06,623
Yeah.

1375
01:01:06,624 --> 01:01:07,624
I have an extra one.

1376
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:08,834
- Really?
- Yeah.

1377
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:10,002
- Thank you so much.
- Take it.

1378
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:12,004
Really? Thank you.

1379
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:13,381
I think you just saved my life.

1380
01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:18,219
So, do you...

1381
01:01:19,888 --> 01:01:21,513
you come here often?

1382
01:01:21,514 --> 01:01:22,639
I do.

1383
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,016
It's my happy place.

1384
01:01:24,017 --> 01:01:27,145
I like to pray as I
look over the view.

1385
01:01:29,105 --> 01:01:31,025
Well, it definitely is a
stunning view, isn't it?

1386
01:01:31,524 --> 01:01:32,525
It is.

1387
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:34,985
Listen...

1388
01:01:34,986 --> 01:01:35,904
I'm Michael, by the way.

1389
01:01:35,905 --> 01:01:37,029
Oh, I'm Melody.

1390
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,550
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1391
01:01:39,282 --> 01:01:40,949
So what do you... what
do you pray about?

1392
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:42,493
- Today?
- Yeah.

1393
01:01:42,494 --> 01:01:43,411
The kids at the youth center.

1394
01:01:43,412 --> 01:01:44,953
Oh.

1395
01:01:44,954 --> 01:01:47,248
Every year, I deliver gifts
to make their spirits bright.

1396
01:01:49,292 --> 01:01:51,377
That's... Oh, no,
you're Santa Claus!

1397
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:52,544
You are!

1398
01:01:52,545 --> 01:01:53,587
You know, I've been
wanting to meet you

1399
01:01:53,588 --> 01:01:54,672
ever since I was a kid.

1400
01:01:54,673 --> 01:01:55,673
I've got to get your autograph?

1401
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:56,591
Do you have a...
do I have a pen?

1402
01:01:56,592 --> 01:01:57,841
I've packed everything else.

1403
01:01:57,842 --> 01:01:59,885
You know, the season's
all about giving back.

1404
01:01:59,886 --> 01:02:01,387
Plus, giving is my
"love language".

1405
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:02,846
Hmm.

1406
01:02:02,847 --> 01:02:04,640
I like that.

1407
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:05,684
I think mine's pizza.

1408
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:08,519
Funny guy.

1409
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,646
I try.

1410
01:02:10,897 --> 01:02:12,617
No, seriously, that's
very admirable of you.

1411
01:02:13,525 --> 01:02:14,650
Thank you.

1412
01:02:14,651 --> 01:02:15,651
I've been blessed with a lot,

1413
01:02:15,652 --> 01:02:16,777
so...

1414
01:02:16,778 --> 01:02:18,070
I make it a habit
of blessing others.

1415
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:21,199
Well, you certainly blessed me.

1416
01:02:23,952 --> 01:02:26,120
You know what, I'm glad we met.

1417
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:27,622
Call this a happy coincidence.

1418
01:02:28,998 --> 01:02:30,291
I don't believe in coincidences.

1419
01:02:32,293 --> 01:02:33,294
Okay... okay.

1420
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:37,423
You know, after the accident,

1421
01:02:37,424 --> 01:02:40,759
they...

1422
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,803
they found this
ornament in her car.

1423
01:02:42,804 --> 01:02:45,306
It was a gazebo, just like this.

1424
01:02:46,307 --> 01:02:47,976
And attached to it was a note.

1425
01:02:49,394 --> 01:02:50,603
It said "To Michael.

1426
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:53,690
Merry Christmas."

1427
01:02:56,526 --> 01:02:58,153
I tell you, Traci...

1428
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:02,031
If she didn't go and
buy that gazebo for me,

1429
01:03:02,032 --> 01:03:03,782
I swear she'd still
be here today.

1430
01:03:03,783 --> 01:03:04,992
Michael, you can't
think like that.

1431
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:06,869
No. I do think like that.

1432
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:08,079
Every single day.

1433
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:13,001
It's like I can't let it go.

1434
01:03:17,464 --> 01:03:18,505
Look at me...

1435
01:03:18,506 --> 01:03:19,674
How sad is this?

1436
01:03:21,259 --> 01:03:22,259
Here I am,

1437
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:24,304
a leader of a
grief-support group.

1438
01:03:28,683 --> 01:03:30,809
It's better than...

1439
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:32,187
acting like everything's okay.

1440
01:03:36,107 --> 01:03:37,483
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1441
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:38,525
Oh...

1442
01:03:38,526 --> 01:03:39,651
not to make matters worse,

1443
01:03:39,652 --> 01:03:41,570
but when I opened the box...

1444
01:03:41,571 --> 01:03:43,490
the ornament was broken.

1445
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:48,161
Maybe I can fix it.

1446
01:03:53,458 --> 01:03:54,626
If you want.

1447
01:04:01,424 --> 01:04:02,883
Wow.

1448
01:04:02,884 --> 01:04:05,124
I can tell you really know
your way around a canvas, huh?

1449
01:04:05,845 --> 01:04:08,098
I am... impressed.

1450
01:04:09,891 --> 01:04:11,934
That's the...

1451
01:04:11,935 --> 01:04:13,561
that's the last painting
we did together.

1452
01:04:15,438 --> 01:04:17,565
It's what we think
Heaven looks like.

1453
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:21,652
And it's immune to criticism,

1454
01:04:21,653 --> 01:04:22,986
because...

1455
01:04:22,987 --> 01:04:24,406
it's up to
interpretation, right?

1456
01:04:25,907 --> 01:04:27,450
Right.

1457
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:30,078
Wow.

1458
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:32,706
This is beautiful, huh?

1459
01:04:34,457 --> 01:04:35,457
May I?

1460
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:37,668
Yeah.

1461
01:04:54,894 --> 01:04:56,061
You're not so bad.

1462
01:04:56,062 --> 01:04:57,688
Well, well.

1463
01:04:57,689 --> 01:04:59,149
Greg was always the...

1464
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:02,318
Anyway...

1465
01:05:03,528 --> 01:05:04,696
here you go.

1466
01:05:05,822 --> 01:05:06,989
It still has some tiny cracks,

1467
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,615
but I think it's
part of the charm.

1468
01:05:08,616 --> 01:05:11,243
You know, it shows that...

1469
01:05:11,244 --> 01:05:12,286
things that are broken

1470
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:14,663
can be made, you know,

1471
01:05:14,664 --> 01:05:16,166
somewhat whole again.

1472
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:19,502
It's perfect.

1473
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:24,006
Thank you.

1474
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:25,383
Of course.

1475
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:30,597
So you never
learned how to play?

1476
01:05:31,723 --> 01:05:32,724
No...

1477
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:35,893
Okay, one song.

1478
01:05:35,894 --> 01:05:37,270
- Okay.
- Just one.

1479
01:05:38,229 --> 01:05:40,064
- All right.
- All right.

1480
01:05:40,065 --> 01:05:42,275
I'll give it a shot.

1481
01:05:58,083 --> 01:05:59,124
That's great!

1482
01:05:59,125 --> 01:06:00,418
- That's right.
- That's good!

1483
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:03,770
That's really good.
We make a great team.

1484
01:06:04,547 --> 01:06:05,547
That's true.

1485
01:06:11,012 --> 01:06:12,471
Um...

1486
01:06:12,472 --> 01:06:14,598
I...

1487
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:16,433
I think I should go.

1488
01:06:16,434 --> 01:06:17,851
- It's getting late.
- It is getting late, yeah.

1489
01:06:17,852 --> 01:06:19,354
But...

1490
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:23,774
thank you...

1491
01:06:23,775 --> 01:06:24,818
for this.

1492
01:06:30,907 --> 01:06:32,658
Goodnight, Traci. Thank you.

1493
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:33,702
Yeah, goodnight.

1494
01:06:41,751 --> 01:06:42,793
You know, as much as I love

1495
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:44,336
having a newly-minted
expert wrapper

1496
01:06:44,337 --> 01:06:46,171
helping me with these,

1497
01:06:46,172 --> 01:06:47,423
shouldn't you be
getting back to work?

1498
01:06:47,424 --> 01:06:49,174
The gallery is in two days.

1499
01:06:49,175 --> 01:06:50,468
I'm merrily procrastinating.

1500
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,262
And un-merrily

1501
01:06:53,263 --> 01:06:55,223
starting to lose
confidence in myself.

1502
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:58,392
If your goal is...

1503
01:06:58,393 --> 01:07:01,645
trying to get people
to feel something,

1504
01:07:01,646 --> 01:07:03,806
maybe you should draw on what
you're feeling right now.

1505
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:06,263
Well, it's a real
mixed bag, Mom.

1506
01:07:09,988 --> 01:07:10,988
Honestly, my...

1507
01:07:12,073 --> 01:07:13,616
my heart is just so conflicted.

1508
01:07:17,996 --> 01:07:20,749
You have grown so much
since you joined that group.

1509
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,418
Maybe the final
piece of this puzzle

1510
01:07:24,419 --> 01:07:25,337
is...

1511
01:07:25,338 --> 01:07:27,005
opening your heart.

1512
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:30,580
And that doesn't mean that
you have to forget about Greg.

1513
01:07:32,218 --> 01:07:35,554
Maybe drawing on
the memories of him

1514
01:07:35,555 --> 01:07:36,555
will help you.

1515
01:07:51,112 --> 01:07:53,197
God,

1516
01:07:53,198 --> 01:07:54,866
I feel lost...

1517
01:07:58,495 --> 01:08:00,372
and I don't know what to do.

1518
01:08:02,165 --> 01:08:04,541
I pray...

1519
01:08:04,542 --> 01:08:06,126
that I am able to help people

1520
01:08:06,127 --> 01:08:08,546
feel something
special for Christmas.

1521
01:08:11,633 --> 01:08:12,884
Amen.

1522
01:08:34,864 --> 01:08:36,366
All right, I've got you.

1523
01:08:37,534 --> 01:08:40,369
Well, being home sure beats
that hospital room any day.

1524
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:42,538
The doctor is one
phone call away,

1525
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:44,790
I will be with you 24/7,

1526
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:46,291
and...

1527
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:48,086
your only job is to rest, okay?

1528
01:08:54,175 --> 01:08:55,426
Dance with me.

1529
01:08:55,427 --> 01:08:57,803
Did you not just
hear what I told you?

1530
01:08:57,804 --> 01:08:58,972
Come on.

1531
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,767
After all,

1532
01:09:03,768 --> 01:09:05,144
we never know how much
time we have left,

1533
01:09:05,145 --> 01:09:07,856
so we have to live each
moment like it's our last.

1534
01:09:09,357 --> 01:09:11,693
We are going to have so
many of these moments.

1535
01:09:13,153 --> 01:09:14,612
Decades more.

1536
01:09:19,534 --> 01:09:21,174
Traci, I need you to
promise me something.

1537
01:09:22,579 --> 01:09:23,621
Anything.

1538
01:09:25,123 --> 01:09:27,333
Never stop laughing,

1539
01:09:27,334 --> 01:09:29,044
and never stop loving.

1540
01:09:31,046 --> 01:09:32,505
And never stop living.

1541
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,383
Okay?

1542
01:09:41,222 --> 01:09:44,350
♪ The world waits
for a miracle ♪

1543
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:46,018
♪ Oh, come... ♪

1544
01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:48,855
♪ Emmanuel ♪

1545
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,073
Traci! Come in!

1546
01:09:59,157 --> 01:10:00,949
Thank you!

1547
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:02,034
What are you doing here?

1548
01:10:02,035 --> 01:10:04,746
And what are you wearing?

1549
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:07,247
I know I look ridiculous,

1550
01:10:07,248 --> 01:10:09,417
but they said they
also need an elf.

1551
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:12,503
What are you talking about?

1552
01:10:12,504 --> 01:10:16,006
The Christmas market
needs a Mrs. Claus,

1553
01:10:16,007 --> 01:10:19,427
and I told them I know someone
with years of experience.

1554
01:10:23,223 --> 01:10:25,432
Maybe all you need to
do is take one step.

1555
01:10:25,433 --> 01:10:26,892
Just try it on,

1556
01:10:26,893 --> 01:10:28,436
see if it fits?

1557
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:33,149
Okay...

1558
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:34,567
Okay!

1559
01:10:37,028 --> 01:10:38,154
It fits like a glove.

1560
01:10:40,907 --> 01:10:44,452
You are rocking that!

1561
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:47,956
But I don't think I
can do this on my own.

1562
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:50,624
Well, you'll have
your trusty elf

1563
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:51,918
right by your side.

1564
01:10:59,342 --> 01:11:00,593
I'll be with you in just a sec.

1565
01:11:03,805 --> 01:11:05,223
Nothing's changed a bit.

1566
01:11:10,854 --> 01:11:12,312
Dad...

1567
01:11:12,313 --> 01:11:13,480
What are you doing here?

1568
01:11:13,481 --> 01:11:14,857
A friend of yours

1569
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:17,485
left a box of Nai Nai's
sweets at my doorstep.

1570
01:11:19,529 --> 01:11:21,169
It's been so long since
I've tried them...

1571
01:11:22,657 --> 01:11:23,992
but I'm glad I did.

1572
01:11:25,994 --> 01:11:26,994
You made them?

1573
01:11:28,329 --> 01:11:29,581
I did.

1574
01:11:30,749 --> 01:11:32,500
They taste just like hers.

1575
01:11:34,836 --> 01:11:36,276
<i>So why'd you ask me
to meet you here?</i>

1576
01:11:37,672 --> 01:11:39,298
I just wanted to celebrate

1577
01:11:39,299 --> 01:11:41,134
your courage for
sharing the other day.

1578
01:11:42,927 --> 01:11:43,927
How does it feel?

1579
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:46,264
Like my soul is healing.

1580
01:11:48,183 --> 01:11:49,263
I know she's still with me.

1581
01:11:52,354 --> 01:11:53,437
You know...

1582
01:11:53,438 --> 01:11:55,106
open mic's about to start.

1583
01:11:56,232 --> 01:11:58,692
And I just so happened...

1584
01:11:58,693 --> 01:12:00,528
to reserve the first slot.

1585
01:12:02,405 --> 01:12:04,199
You wanna give it a shot?

1586
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:08,870
I think I can do it.

1587
01:12:14,626 --> 01:12:16,377
I came to apologize.

1588
01:12:16,378 --> 01:12:17,795
No. Whoa.

1589
01:12:17,796 --> 01:12:19,463
No, no. You don't... You
don't have to do that, Dad.

1590
01:12:19,464 --> 01:12:20,714
It was a hard time
for all of us,

1591
01:12:20,715 --> 01:12:21,840
and we all grieve differently.

1592
01:12:21,841 --> 01:12:24,176
I was angry,

1593
01:12:24,177 --> 01:12:25,220
and I took it out on you.

1594
01:12:26,971 --> 01:12:28,514
It wasn't fair...

1595
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:31,308
and I'm sorry.

1596
01:12:31,309 --> 01:12:34,520
If my mother taught
me anything at all,

1597
01:12:34,521 --> 01:12:38,482
it is that there is nothing
more important in life

1598
01:12:38,483 --> 01:12:39,609
than family.

1599
01:12:43,697 --> 01:12:45,030
You have no idea
how much it means

1600
01:12:45,031 --> 01:12:46,074
to hear you say that.

Hey, Joyce.

1611
01:13:55,352 --> 01:13:56,518
Yeah!

1612
01:13:56,519 --> 01:13:57,936
I...

1613
01:13:57,937 --> 01:13:59,313
I think you're gonna like
what I've been working on...

1614
01:13:59,314 --> 01:14:01,565
And it will be done just
in time for the gallery.

1615
01:14:01,566 --> 01:14:03,275
I just have...

1616
01:14:03,276 --> 01:14:04,778
one more thing left to do.

1617
01:14:15,121 --> 01:14:16,706
Hey.

1618
01:14:17,457 --> 01:14:19,042
Hey.

1619
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:24,464
Happy Anniversary.

1620
01:14:27,092 --> 01:14:27,926
Traci...

1621
01:14:27,927 --> 01:14:29,344
what are you doing here?

1622
01:14:30,804 --> 01:14:32,930
Well, I thought it was strange

1623
01:14:32,931 --> 01:14:35,432
that you weren't
returning any of my calls.

1624
01:14:35,433 --> 01:14:36,892
Right.

1625
01:14:36,893 --> 01:14:38,352
And then I remembered...

1626
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:40,980
that it was December 23rd.

1627
01:14:42,065 --> 01:14:42,857
Yeah.

1628
01:14:42,858 --> 01:14:44,401
The day we first met...

1629
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:47,519
and the day we got married.

1630
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:56,995
I hope I'm not intruding.

1631
01:14:56,996 --> 01:14:58,497
I just wanted to make
sure you were okay.

1632
01:14:58,498 --> 01:14:59,832
No, no, no.

1633
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:01,208
Not intruding at all.

1634
01:15:01,209 --> 01:15:02,459
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1635
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:04,044
Yeah.

1636
01:15:04,045 --> 01:15:05,255
You know what...

1637
01:15:08,091 --> 01:15:09,091
I'm okay.

1638
01:15:12,595 --> 01:15:13,971
Every year,

1639
01:15:13,972 --> 01:15:15,932
I bring a flower up
here to remember her.

1640
01:15:18,268 --> 01:15:19,685
Listen, Traci, about
the other night...

1641
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:22,272
No, no, no. We do not
need to talk about that.

1642
01:15:24,357 --> 01:15:25,775
Today is about you and Melody.

1643
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,362
I was sitting here,

1644
01:15:30,363 --> 01:15:31,906
and I was thinking...

1645
01:15:33,783 --> 01:15:37,578
I am so grateful

1646
01:15:37,579 --> 01:15:39,539
for all the years that
we spent together...

1647
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:44,501
and from now on, that's...

1648
01:15:44,502 --> 01:15:45,962
that's what I vow to hold on to.

1649
01:15:47,589 --> 01:15:49,174
It's hard. It's really hard.

1650
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:53,093
For some reason,
this year, I just...

1651
01:15:53,094 --> 01:15:54,846
I don't know, I just feel...

1652
01:15:56,306 --> 01:15:57,932
more at peace.

1653
01:15:58,808 --> 01:16:00,185
Sounds like healing to me.

1654
01:16:06,441 --> 01:16:08,068
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1655
01:16:31,633 --> 01:16:32,633
That's incredible.

1656
01:16:33,885 --> 01:16:34,803
That's incredible, isn't it?

1657
01:16:34,804 --> 01:16:36,637
I mean, we have made

1658
01:16:36,638 --> 01:16:38,931
a ton of progress
these past few weeks.

1659
01:16:38,932 --> 01:16:39,973
I have a feeling
you're talking about

1660
01:16:39,974 --> 01:16:41,226
more than just the tree.

1661
01:16:42,227 --> 01:16:43,895
Um, well, your
feeling's correct, I am.

1662
01:16:45,689 --> 01:16:47,049
So, what do you
say we get started?

1663
01:16:47,691 --> 01:16:48,650
Is Traci coming?

1664
01:16:48,651 --> 01:16:49,858
Actually, I don't think so.

1665
01:16:49,859 --> 01:16:51,579
I think she's really
busy with her art show.

1666
01:16:52,362 --> 01:16:54,154
- I should have canceled...
- Sorry I'm late!

1667
01:16:54,155 --> 01:16:55,155
- Hey!
- Hi!

1668
01:16:55,156 --> 01:16:56,824
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

1669
01:16:56,825 --> 01:16:57,991
Merry Christmas!

1670
01:16:57,992 --> 01:17:00,994
I waited until the
last possible minute

1671
01:17:00,995 --> 01:17:02,329
to invite you to this...

1672
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:03,414
But it's probably because

1673
01:17:03,415 --> 01:17:04,832
I waited till the
last possible minute

1674
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:06,334
to finish my art.

1675
01:17:07,293 --> 01:17:08,544
Your gallery exhibit? Tonight?

1676
01:17:08,545 --> 01:17:09,920
Yes!

1677
01:17:09,921 --> 01:17:11,547
And I would love
for you to stop by,

1678
01:17:11,548 --> 01:17:12,715
if you can, no pressure.

1679
01:17:12,716 --> 01:17:13,924
- But there will be cookies.
- I'm there.

1680
01:17:13,925 --> 01:17:15,551
- Me too!
- You had me at "cookies".

1681
01:17:15,552 --> 01:17:17,177
I wouldn't miss
it. I wouldn't.

1682
01:17:17,178 --> 01:17:18,887
We're all going. We're there.

1683
01:17:18,888 --> 01:17:20,723
So, while we're all here,
why don't I open things up?

1684
01:17:20,724 --> 01:17:22,182
Yeah, actually...

1685
01:17:22,183 --> 01:17:24,018
What?

1686
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:25,645
Can I open things up tonight?

1687
01:17:28,231 --> 01:17:29,356
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1688
01:17:29,357 --> 01:17:30,524
I'd be honored.

1689
01:17:30,525 --> 01:17:31,984
Okay. Okay.

1690
01:17:31,985 --> 01:17:34,237
I'm a little rusty,
but here we go.

1691
01:17:38,324 --> 01:17:39,993
Dear God...

1692
01:17:42,787 --> 01:17:44,121
in the last two years,

1693
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:45,581
I've...

1694
01:17:45,582 --> 01:17:48,585
often thought that my prayers
weren't being answered...

1695
01:17:51,046 --> 01:17:53,298
and now I know that
they were answered...

1696
01:17:54,424 --> 01:17:56,384
just not in the way I expected.

1697
01:17:58,136 --> 01:17:59,429
You led me to this group.

1698
01:18:02,223 --> 01:18:06,477
Thank you so much for the
gift of new friendships.

1699
01:18:06,478 --> 01:18:07,603
And I ask you, God,

1700
01:18:07,604 --> 01:18:10,064
just to bless every person...

1701
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:11,441
in this group tonight...

1702
01:18:12,609 --> 01:18:14,069
and continue to heal us...

1703
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:17,404
with Your peace,

1704
01:18:17,405 --> 01:18:19,239
love,

1705
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,407
and joy.

1706
01:18:20,408 --> 01:18:21,408
Amen.

1707
01:18:21,409 --> 01:18:22,952
Amen!

1708
01:18:23,787 --> 01:18:24,787
You weren't rusty at all!

1709
01:18:26,748 --> 01:18:27,998
Thank you.

1710
01:18:27,999 --> 01:18:30,001
I learned from the best.

1711
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,025
Best seats in the house.

1712
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:00,364
Hi, everyone!

1713
01:19:00,365 --> 01:19:01,615
Merry Christmas.

1714
01:19:01,616 --> 01:19:02,742
Merry Christmas!

1715
01:19:04,953 --> 01:19:06,161
As many of you know,

1716
01:19:06,162 --> 01:19:09,456
the last couple of
years have been...

1717
01:19:09,457 --> 01:19:11,459
really hard.

1718
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:13,877
I, um...

1719
01:19:13,878 --> 01:19:15,714
almost gave up on
my art completely.

1720
01:19:17,215 --> 01:19:19,759
But that would have been
taking the easy way out.

1721
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:23,471
So I decided to take
the hard road...

1722
01:19:26,683 --> 01:19:29,309
and open my heart,

1723
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:31,521
and the creativity followed.

1724
01:19:32,689 --> 01:19:35,524
That never...

1725
01:19:35,525 --> 01:19:36,817
would have been possible

1726
01:19:36,818 --> 01:19:39,903
without the love and
support of my Mom and Dad,

1727
01:19:39,904 --> 01:19:41,281
and my friends...

1728
01:19:42,115 --> 01:19:43,408
who are all here tonight.

1729
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:48,662
Each and every one of you

1730
01:19:48,663 --> 01:19:51,249
inspired me to seek hope...

1731
01:19:52,876 --> 01:19:54,501
and love...

1732
01:19:54,502 --> 01:19:55,628
and joy...

1733
01:19:56,921 --> 01:19:58,839
even in life's toughest moments.

1734
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,133
This is dedicated to them.

1735
01:20:04,721 --> 01:20:06,097
Now I would love to present...

1736
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:09,309
"Hearts of Healing".

1737
01:20:18,234 --> 01:20:20,235
Look, I'm wearing my
Mrs. Claus outfit!

1738
01:20:20,236 --> 01:20:22,237
- And there's little Presley!
- Adorable!

1739
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:24,656
Is that the
quadruple-chocolate donut?

1740
01:20:24,657 --> 01:20:26,076
It is!

1741
01:20:31,873 --> 01:20:32,956
I want to thank you all

1742
01:20:32,957 --> 01:20:35,125
for joining us tonight.

1743
01:20:35,126 --> 01:20:38,420
The theme for this year's
Christmas Eve service

1744
01:20:38,421 --> 01:20:41,132
is "Holding on
while letting go".

1745
01:20:43,093 --> 01:20:44,176
Now, I'm sure there's
some of you here

1746
01:20:44,177 --> 01:20:46,346
that have lost someone
close to you...

1747
01:20:47,347 --> 01:20:49,348
and I urge you to look around

1748
01:20:49,349 --> 01:20:51,226
and realize that
you're not alone.

1749
01:20:55,188 --> 01:20:57,356
By lighting these balloons,

1750
01:20:57,357 --> 01:20:58,565
we signify

1751
01:20:58,566 --> 01:20:59,566
that the ones that
we've lost in our lives

1752
01:20:59,567 --> 01:21:00,567
will always remain...

1753
01:21:01,611 --> 01:21:03,612
in our hearts.

1754
01:21:03,613 --> 01:21:05,333
But before we do, I'd
like to take a moment.

1755
01:21:06,199 --> 01:21:08,575
I'd like all of us to...

1756
01:21:08,576 --> 01:21:09,993
say a prayer,

1757
01:21:09,994 --> 01:21:12,955
recall a memory...

1758
01:21:12,956 --> 01:21:14,499
hold them in your heart.

1759
01:21:23,299 --> 01:21:24,633
Now...

1760
01:21:24,634 --> 01:21:27,928
as we release these
balloons into the sky,

1761
01:21:27,929 --> 01:21:29,449
I'd like all of us
to celebrate them...

1762
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:32,392
as we let them go.

1763
01:21:34,853 --> 01:21:36,603
Are you ready?

1764
01:21:36,604 --> 01:21:38,897
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1765
01:21:38,898 --> 01:21:40,315
Whoo...

1766
01:21:40,316 --> 01:21:42,317

two...

1768
01:21:43,945 --> 01:21:45,405

Okay?

Can you teach me
to paint sometime?

Oh, yeah, yeah.
