00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,525

00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,568
(Angry crowd)

3
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,863
(Loud Speaker) Attention: This is a secure area.
For your own safety move away

4
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,115
from the spacecraft. Selectees please move
quickly to your assigned boarding stations.

5
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,201
Altus Exodus.

6
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,789
Welcome aboard Altus Exodus.

7
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,960
- Welcome aboard Altus Exodus.
- Move this line faster.

8
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,298
Come on!

9
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,721
Move it. Faster. Move it! Come
on.

10
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,186
(Explosion)

11
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,062
Vasquez.

12
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,606
Help!

13
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:08,277
- This is Baum. The Crowd is riding.
I have men down. -Stop! Stop!

14
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,447
Pebbles. Howell you're with me.

15
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,161
31st command. This is Baum. Do
you read.

16
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,746
Dammit!

17
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,107
I have un authorized personnel
boarding the Albert Einstein.

18
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,808
In pursuit. Ground that air
support. Close those doors!

19
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,939
Freeze! Freeze!

20
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,400
We just wanna live.

21
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:53,696
Captain. We may have stow aways
on board.

22
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,364
Emergency launch now!

23
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,034
Now!

24
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:03,081
(Rumble)

25
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,010
Full thrust now.

26
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,896
I'm sorry. We can't do that
Lieutenant..

27
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,857
Baum Sir. Frank Baum. 31st
tactical command.

28
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,069
North American joint military.

29
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:35,906
Captain Sam Crowe. Activate
autopilot and sleep mode.

30
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:40,409
Sir. Those people don't belong
on your ship.

31
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,828
This is one of humanities
lifeboats.

32
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:47,166
Some where chosen for needed skills.
Others were picked by lottery.

33
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,545
So one human must be just good
as another.

34
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,171
Well I have to get back sir.

35
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,883
My team and I are part of
Earth's defenses.

36
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:59,721
TIM activate interface once
we reach cryo.

37
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,056
Yes Sir.

38
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,975
We're not going into Cryo Sir.

39
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:08,020
You know there is an old sailor
saying Frank.

40
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,567
"Never jump into a lifeboat until
you have to jump up into it".

41
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,652
The war is over. We lost.

42
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,488
No sir. We are not giving up.

43
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,784
We've been accelerating at one
"G" ever since we left orbit.

44
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,829
There is no going back.

45
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,293
I wasn't asking, sir.

46
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,592
You know what? You can shoot me.

47
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,928
But you can't change the laws of
physics.

48
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:46,560
We are going to another world. And we will all
be very happy to have your protection there.

49
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,902
Altus Exodus, Frank.

50
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,865
Do you see a red cape, sir?

51
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,871
What are you looking at?
Everyone back to work.

52
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,933
(Female Technician) Alright Lieutenant
we'll be putting you in cryo now.

53
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,068
I'll hang on to this.

54
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,536
Will I dream?

55
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,248
Nightmares...

56
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,960
It will be like no time has pass
at all.

57
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:13,897
(Gasp)

58
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:25,325

59
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:36,036
(Beeping/ Groans)

60
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,882
(Beeping continues)

61
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:45,679
(Glass Cracking)

62
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,395
(Explosion)

63
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:12,641
(Gunshots)

64
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,340
(Gunshots)

65
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,152
Come on. Up you go. Come on.

66
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,540
(Groans)

67
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,377

68
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,562

69
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,572

70
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,623
(Groans)

71
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,584
(Groans)

72
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:19,768
Come on. Come on. Alright.

73
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:30,656
(Groans)

74
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,897
(rustling in the woods)

75
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,241
(Whisper) Hey!

76
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,827
(Whispers)
Psst! Over here.

77
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,417
Take that off.

78
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,584
What?

79
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:27,668
Ssshh!

80
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,881
(Whispers) You might as well
have a bull's-eye on your back.

81
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,929
How we - What the hell's going
on?

82
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,680
Who's shooting at us?

83
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,350
I don't know.

84
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:47,522
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

85
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:51,401
Come on. Come on.

86
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,627
I'm going up there to recon.

87
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,713
You stay here. Take him.

88
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:43,411
I thought I told you to stay
back there.

89
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,080
You're the one with the gun.

90
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,843
(Whistles)

91
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,096
(Whistles)

92
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,480
Come on.

93
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:11,940
Come on.

94
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,574
Frank.

95
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,493
Frank.

96
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,037
Report.

97
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,206
Howell died in crash.

98
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:31,293
I don't know about Vasquez.

99
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:34,421
Something's been chasing us but
I couldn't get a good look.

100
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,007
They took out Vasquez.

101
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:42,595
They're big. Some sort of sonic
disrupt or with active camouflage.

102
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,640
Active camouflage?

103
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,311
I found these two wondering
after the crash.

104
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:54,315
We better get moving. There's a
stream about half a klick away.

105
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:55,358
We'll throw them off our trail.

106
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,153
Why should we follow you?

107
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,822
I'm the one with the gun.

108
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,667
No Weapon?

109
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:16,046
Lost it in the crash. I got
this.

110
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,674
Could you find anything bigger?

111
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,174
It's bigger then yours.

112
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:21,343
It's not what your mama said.

113
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,010
(Laughs)

114
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,471
Alright.

115
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,472
Did you see those others?

116
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,431
The pale skinny ones?

117
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,016
Yeah I saw them.

118
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,602
They disappeared quick though. I
don't what they were.

119
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,521
They looked almost human.

120
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:34,982
Almost.

121
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,622
Who are you people?

122
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,170
We are-

123
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:11,935
(Gasp) No, no no. Too much noise.
They're harmless.

124
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,147
Who are you people?

125
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:19,651
We're from the Isaac Newton. We
came in on-

126
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,247
(Gasp)

127
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,463
What the hell was that?

128
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:43,842
Come on. Come on.

129
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,154
Follow the stream.

130
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,989
I'll bear off and lead them
away.

131
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,241
With you boss.

132
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,962
Oh No, you stay with them. Keep
them moving.

133
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:11,620
Watch your 6.

134
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,288
You! You're T.I.M.

135
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,291
Yes Sir. I'd be happy to assist
you in anyway I can.

136
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,628
No, Why is he in charge?

137
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,506
Come on.

138
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,385
(Yells)

139
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:27,928
Come on. Hurry up!

140
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:31,055
Sir, I might suggest you would
be safer under these unusual

141
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,642
circumstances if you were
to lower your voice.

142
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:35,059
<i>We want them to follow us!</i>

143
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,186
Sir, I am programmed to
preserve human life.

144
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:41,732
I'll preserve your damn ass
if you don't make some noise!

145
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,862
As you wish, Sir. I'm happy to
assist you!

146
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,209
(Rustling)

147
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,214
I found a place to hide.

148
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:37,890
Who the hell are you people? You weren't on the
Albert Einstein. And where the hell are we?

149
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,434
Don't you know? You've got crew.

150
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:43,105
You've got that.

151
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:44,940
It's ok Honda.

152
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:46,942
We were on the Isaac Newton.

153
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,943
That was the first Ark to
leave.

154
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:55,783
Right. We crashed here. We don't know why.
None of our crew survived.

155
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:59,955
We were rounded up by the Chameleons.
Those things that are chasing us.

156
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,917
Some of us were brought back and
were put in to the um-

157
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:11,007
I don't know what to call it. It
was like a prison? A Zoo? A Lab?

158
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,134
What does it matter? It has
cages.

159
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:18,890
It had cages. Until your ship crashed into it.
Now more of our people are dead.

160
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,474
But you're free.

161
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:23,520
Yeah and now they are hunting us
instead of feeding us.

162
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,023
Do you want to go back there?

163
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:32,946
No.

164
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,866
I didn't think so.

165
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,367
Now we have to work together.

166
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:41,413
To do what? We don't even know
where we are.

167
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,916
Captain, do you know where we
are?

168
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,958
I-

169
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:50,339
This can't be Alpha Proxima 5.
There's only one sun.

170
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,674
Where...

171
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:57,345
It's the head wound. Probably a
concussion.

172
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:58,472
You a doctor?

173
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,934
I'm a nurse, but I don't have
any supplies.

174
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,978
I'll see what I can do.

175
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:09,524
What about you? You are T.I.M
aren't you?

176
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:12,068
I am a Transhuman Interactive
Machine.

177
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:16,864
But my friends call me Tim. I'd be
happy to assist you in anyway I can.

178
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,407
Make me a banana split.

179
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,743
I regret I don't have the
necessary ingredients.

180
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,620
Yeah, then what good are you?

181
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:25,122
Where are we? And how can we
both be on the same planet.

182
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,708
Hannah, each Ark went to it's
own destination.

183
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,336
I'm very sorry that I can't
answer your question.

184
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:34,841
Whatever caused the ship to crash happened
before I was scheduled to awaken.

185
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:39,053
However, once I was functional I began
recording all ship's telemetry.

186
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:46,352
Really? Just before the crash I saw something, triangular.
It looked like a space ship.

187
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:50,523
Yes. I believe I can provide range
and bearing to that target.

188
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:53,277
But exactly what it is, I'm
afraid I can't say.

189
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:57,738
Then we have a plan. That ship
could be our ticket home.

190
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,700
We left earth for a reason. The
aliens were exterminating us!

191
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,368
<i>What do you think these
aliens are doing?</i>

192
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:05,330
We'll find that ship and get
back to earth.

193
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:09,293
We've got to get away from here
as far away as possible.

194
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,420
Right?

195
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,753
Yeah.

196
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,089
Yeah.

197
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:15,966
Yeah, well you're the one with
the gun.

198
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,386
So how long were you prisoners?

199
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:23,598
More like Lab rats. But about 2
years.

200
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,932
That's not possible.

201
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,852
I saw the newton leave on TV a
month ago.

202
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:31,272
I lost counted of the days
around 490.

203
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:35,735
I was sick for a while. And that
was a while ago.

204
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:37,112
All relative.

205
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,863
How long does a concussion
last?

206
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:41,824
I believe Captain Crowe may be
less impaired than he seems.

207
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:44,952
He may be trying to convey that
the elapsed time disparity is due

208
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:48,664
to the effects of Einstein's
theory of special relativity.

209
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,374
I always hated physics.

210
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:55,130
Sargent, let's scout at 6. make
sure we are not growing a tail.

211
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,264
So you're fine flying back to
earth just to get killed?

212
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,476
I didn't say that. Did I?

213
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:11,979
If there is a ship. There's gonna
be a place on this planet where

214
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,981
there are no chameleon
things are.

215
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,359
Like an island or something.

216
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:19,946
Yeah. But what if we can't
change their mind?

217
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:22,658
Then it's a good thing I'm a
pilot.

218
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:42,052
(Groan)

219
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:48,016
(Screaming)

220
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:58,706
(Gunshots)

221
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:21,300
Perimeter.

222
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:41,319
(Rustling in the Jungle)

223
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,196
What the hell was that?

224
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:44,739
Let's go find out.

225
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,034
Sargent! With me.

226
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:50,204
Are you ok?

227
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:54,708
(Screaming)

228
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,419
Stay in a circle.

229
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,634
Fan out.

230
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:07,179
(Yelling)

231
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:27,032
Where she go?

232
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:47,135
It's ok. It's alright. We won't
hurt you.

233
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,430
It's ok. It's ok.

234
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:54,934
She looks almost human. How is
that possible?

235
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:57,895
We don't know much about them. And the
cages, they use to huddle together

236
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:01,983
when they weren't being used for
slave labor, or for experiments.

237
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:05,779
But I've never seen one like her
before.

238
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:35,517
It's alright.

239
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,504
Tastes... like... crap.

240
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:08,132
Frank.

241
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,177
I'm Lea.

242
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,807
You're ok.

243
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:20,729
Where'd they go?

244
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:23,565
Where did they go?

245
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:29,862
What the hell is that?

246
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,073
Her name is Lea.

247
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,741
How do you know her name?

248
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:36,370
I... said it... to him.

249
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:42,041
The humanoids in the zoo never
spoke. How do you know English?

250
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,501
I learned... from you.

251
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:45,336
From him?

252
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:51,259
From all of you. From jungle... I listen
you in damn cages. You talk a lot.

253
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,760
She was spying on you.

254
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,220
We never saw her.

255
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:58,558
Can't imagine why. Best damn
camouflage I've ever saw.

256
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,644
Except for the Chameleons.

257
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:06,274
Yeah. We'd better get going.

258
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:08,068
No wait where's Honda?

259
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,903
Not a trace.

260
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:13,657
The Captain needs rest. And
food.

261
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:15,784
Alright, who's got food.

262
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,704
This is it.

263
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:22,583
Food. Food everywhere. I show
you.

264
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:28,212
Alright. Dug in. We'll get food.
Give that to Captain Crowe.

265
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:29,630
Why you gonna give that to him?

266
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:31,174
You're just going to trust her?

267
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:32,967
What choice do I have?

268
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:34,552
Watch at 6.

269
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:38,724
Plus your gun's outta amo. Why
should we follow you?

270
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:43,811
Lieutenant Baum's training as
a military officer would have

271
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:45,813
included advanced
survival tactics.

272
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:50,401
As long as Captain Crowe incapacitated,
he is the logical leader.

273
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:53,238
Where is my banana split
already?

274
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:07,628
Here.

275
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,715
Good to eat. Sweet.

276
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:19,848
No!

277
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,853
Capelblom. One eat of
those kill a Kormoryx.

278
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,187
Kormoryx?

279
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:28,315
Very big. Very... bad?

280
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:29,650
Got it.

281
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:33,570
You always fed yourself?

282
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:36,365
Always.

283
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:38,700
Even when you were little?

284
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,725
Food.

285
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:18,574
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!
- Hey!

286
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:28,500
If you ever lay a hand on any member of
this group again I'll kick your ass.

287
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,339
Unless she beats me to it.

288
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:37,049
She put the fire out.

289
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,136
So she saved your ass again. The
fire would have given us away.

290
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:43,848
Well I am sorry I don't have your
training but we can't eat it raw.

291
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:45,851
What the hell is this anyway?

292
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:50,397
Don't worry. It will taste just
like chicken.

293
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:54,693
Hope this spaceship has an oven.

294
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,743
So what can you tell Chameleons?

295
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:06,329
<i>It's not like I've been able to
run tests on them .</i>

296
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,583
They have technology. Better than ours. But
they only seem to use it when they have to.

297
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:17,298
They keep the humanoids they catch as slaves, but
they didn't seem to know what to make of us.

298
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:20,968
What did they do to you?

299
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:23,847
Well, they seem to want to
know if we could inter--EH!

300
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:27,266
Cassie.

301
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:29,436
Sorry.

302
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:32,940
We're going to get wet.

303
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:36,609
I'd be happy to assist in
constructing a rain shelter,

304
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,403
however I don't believe that was
thunder.

305
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:41,657
Everybody under cover. Now!

306
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:42,990
Come on.

307
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:44,535
Oh god.

308
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:47,995
(Explosion)

309
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:50,122
(Screaming)

310
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:52,166
(crying)

311
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,960
No. No.

312
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:56,380
(Crying) Jason!

313
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,218
What the hell just happen?

314
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:06,138
This soil appears rich in
decomposing biological matter.

315
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:10,726
It's possible the bombs ignited the methane.
Higher ground will be safer.

316
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,270
Still looking like paradise to
you?!

317
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:14,564
This place ain't perfect but
it's got good air.

318
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:18,568
Even better then earth. Food. Water.
Even the right type of gravity.

319
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:20,611
You're forgetting about the
Chameleons.

320
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:22,280
Tim, which way to the ship?!

321
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:25,658
The structure is approximately
ten miles in that direction.

322
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:27,535
Let's get off this planet.

323
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,620
Don't ever try to stop me from
doing something again.

324
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:33,541
Lieutenant, as a military officer I
recognize that you tolerate a higher

325
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:38,129
level of risk than the others, but
I cannot allow you, or any human,

326
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:43,802
to sacrifice themselves for a lost cause.
Jason was already dead.

327
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:55,396
(Humming)

328
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:59,567
♪ It's a long way to Tipperary.
It's a long way- ♪

329
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:01,485
Captain.

330
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:03,697
Sorry.

331
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:06,408
How are you doing?

332
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,785
How am I doing? Better.

333
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:12,955
Thanks for uh-keeping the group
moving.

334
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:14,749
It's my job but I-

335
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,336
I had a concussion once... They asked me my name.
I said "Wednesday".

336
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:20,087
To bad it was Saturday.

337
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,797
(Laughs)

338
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:24,008
I wonder what day it is here.

339
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,927
And what time?

340
00:31:25,928 --> 00:31:28,721
Well the sun is going down. We
just don't know how long the

341
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:30,933
days are. Or the nights.

342
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,935
Yeah.

343
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:38,564
Sergeant, Improvised Weaponry
101.

344
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:40,275
Yes sir.

345
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,114
Do you have any idea where we
are?

346
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:52,286
Our target was Barnard's Star 4. But
that shouldn't have these rings.

347
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:55,122
Something went wrong.

348
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:59,127
We were supposed to go to Alpha
Centauri. Three suns there.

349
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:02,630
I didn't have time to check the star charts.
Once we came out of.

350
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:04,591
Cryo we were hitting
the atmosphere.

351
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:10,346
Frank, Alpha Centauri is the
nearest star system to Earth.

352
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:15,727
So wherever we are,
We're further away then that.

353
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:17,270
So-

354
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:20,983
So we're talking 40 years. Maybe
more.

355
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:26,280
Earth is still there. You just
find it.

356
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:30,951
If it was a ship, yeah I'll find
it.

357
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:43,629
Your camouflage is incredible.

358
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,339
"Camouflage"?

359
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,592
Your um-

360
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:48,719
I wish I could disappear like
that.

361
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:51,180
You want... be like me?

362
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:57,268
What What is "get the hell off
this planet"?

363
00:32:57,269 --> 00:33:03,692
My world was under attack. They bombed us from orbit.
That we didn't even see it coming.

364
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:09,864
Hhmm, your world. Where do you
come from?

365
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:15,454
Earth. Far Far Away. Out there.

366
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:18,039
Like tell children. Stories.

367
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:23,754
Well that's what we thought until they
came and try to take our world from us.

368
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:28,842
And... go back?

369
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:32,054
If we can.

370
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:41,395
Well, that could be a problem.

371
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:44,232
Our destination lies on the
other side of those mountains.

372
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:46,400
How did I know you were going to
say that?

373
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:50,405
I don't know. Clairvoyance in humans
is not a well-understood ability.

374
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,910
Altus Exodus, Frank? Huh?

375
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:22,229
The others are never going to
make it up here.

376
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:25,816
We've got to
find an easier way.

377
00:34:32,614 --> 00:34:34,366
No one else ever do this.

378
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:38,287
None of your people use
camouflage?

379
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:41,790
Not my people. They hide
in caves.

380
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:45,751
I live in jungle. I hunt,
I kill, I feed. Me alone.

381
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:48,881
Ok. What about family?

382
00:34:49,506 --> 00:34:51,300
No.

383
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:54,887
They must be lonely.

384
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:57,139
You family?

385
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:59,099
On Earth. Maybe.

386
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:09,275
You didn't hide.

387
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:10,902
No.

388
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:13,864
Always something ready to hurt
you.

389
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:15,991
Remember.

390
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:19,703
OK.

391
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:24,208
Do you hear that?

392
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:26,376
Water.

393
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:45,521
Are you sure this water is safe?

394
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:49,358
Most of the water on Earth is
polluted.

395
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:51,276
Polluted?

396
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:53,070
Nevermind.

397
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:12,630
Do you have any idea where this
water goes?

398
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:14,590
Down to...

399
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:17,885
What the word...

400
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:19,429
Big Water.

401
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:24,226
You mean like a lake or river?

402
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:28,814
I'll be right back.

403
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:46,248
Hide!

404
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:08,228
You really want to say here?

405
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:14,484
If those things catch us... Honda
told me Hannah wasn't sick.

406
00:37:14,485 --> 00:37:17,321
They impregnated her and she
miscarried.

407
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:21,408
Like I said, we need to find a
place away from those things.

408
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:27,246
In Earth, 12 billion people. There
were still some unhabited Islands.

409
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:28,832
We need to find a place like
that.

410
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:33,712
But there's only 2 of us. And
you're not really my type.

411
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:37,341
So we stay alive. We watch each
other's backs.

412
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:40,219
The Captain is the only other
pilot.

413
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:43,262
If something were to happen to
him-

414
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,681
Yeah. Then they need you.

415
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:51,270
We could take charge. Fly some
place safe, and just leave.

416
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:55,149
It makes sense. The others will
come around.

417
00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:00,321
Hhhmm, Yeah. That Victoria is
kinda hot.

418
00:38:00,322 --> 00:38:03,617
We just need to be ready for
"opportunities".

419
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:07,454
(Faint Buzzing)
What's that sound?

420
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:17,964
Lieutenant Baum, there is a
Chameleon Airship approaching.

421
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,382
Please join us in hiding.

422
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:20,550
Yeah I know.

423
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:25,054
Look, there's a river that will
take us right where we need to be.

424
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:26,848
But we've got to make a run for
it.

425
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:28,349
But they'll catch us.

426
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,976
Would you for once just shut up
and listen to him.

427
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:32,771
We've got to move now! Come on!

428
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:37,692
TIM do you float?

429
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:41,655
I'm capable of submerged or
surface operation.

430
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:45,159
Ahh!

431
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:50,247
Get in the water. Stay Submerged
as long as you can. Come on.

432
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,710
Let the river take you.

433
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:14,396
(Screaming)

434
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:29,744
Lieutenant! Here!

435
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:32,080
Everyone out! Come on. Let's go!

436
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:53,018
Where's Hannah?

437
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:04,111
(Screams)
No! No! No!

438
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:07,783
Help! Help! Help!

439
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:13,247
Come on Peebs.

440
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:42,484
We must go. Kormoryx is near.
I can smell it.

441
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:46,279
I would be happy to assist by
digging a grave for Hannah.

442
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,407
Happy? Heartless Son-of-a-

443
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,492
That's enough. We don't have
time for this.

444
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:53,662
We don't have time. Stop. Stop.

445
00:40:56,123 --> 00:41:00,293
I must apologize if I have offended.
I'm only here to assist.

446
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:06,132
While my form is designed to put you at
ease, you're correct. I have no heart.

447
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:09,427
That's very touching, but aren't we
supposed to be finding the ship?

448
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:11,596
What the hell is a Kormoryx?

449
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:13,682
Very big. Very Bad.

450
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:18,020
We're going to bury her, aren't
we?

451
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:20,522
We didn't get to bury the
others.

452
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:23,609
There's nothing left to bury
man.

453
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:30,699
You know what? We are going to save humanity.
We gotta stay human.

454
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:33,242
So we are going to bury her.

455
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:34,703
He's right.

456
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:50,218
It's an attack ship. It must
have escaped the invasion.

457
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:52,261
Looks like they made a
controlled landing.

458
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:54,431
(Gasp) Stop Stop Stop.

459
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:00,269
Crap!

460
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:05,566
It will eat us. All of us! Skin
too tough for spears.

461
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,735
We need to get inside that ship.

462
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:13,367
Well, it's not gonna eat all of
us, will it?

463
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:16,661
Would you be happy to assist us?

464
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:20,666
Look, just distract it. Get it
to chase you.

465
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:25,086
You're not edible. There's
nothing to be afraid of.

466
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:30,508
I'm not programmed for fear. But if I'm
not edible, how will I lure it away?

467
00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:32,426
(Sniffs)

468
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:34,388
Switch clothes with him.

469
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:42,437
Shoo.

470
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:50,612
Out! Out! Damn dragon!

471
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:03,417
Everyone. Those are capelblom,
they're poisonous don't eat them.

472
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:28,275
Looks pretty good.

473
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:48,336
Huh.

474
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:49,712
Is it dead?

475
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:52,758
I don't know. Keep your fingers
crossed.

476
00:43:58,722 --> 00:44:01,016
(Sigh)

477
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:03,810
We'll have to check the
power cell connections.

478
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,402
Here. Pull this up. Right here.
Right here. Pull up.

479
00:44:16,824 --> 00:44:17,991
There she is.

480
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:22,912
It looks ok.

481
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:25,164
I didn't expect for everything
to work perfectly.

482
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:31,087
But these connections are secure.
It should power the basic system.

483
00:44:31,088 --> 00:44:36,592
I checked the weapons locker. It's empty.
But the emergency kit is intact.

484
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:38,637
Like it's never been opened.

485
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:41,765
They took the weapons and left
all the survival supplies?

486
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:47,311
Impossible.

487
00:44:47,312 --> 00:44:49,188
What?

488
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:52,441
I thought an antimatter power cell
was good for a thousand years?

489
00:44:52,442 --> 00:44:55,027
Well that's what they say in the
handbook.

490
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:56,154
(Sigh)

491
00:44:56,155 --> 00:44:59,366
Ahh! Hard as a rock.

492
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:03,912
Alright lets check every compartment.
There's gotta be an answer here.

493
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:14,130
That's it. No coffee mugs, no old magazines.
It's like it's fresh from the factory.

494
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:15,673
It doesn't make any sense.

495
00:45:15,674 --> 00:45:17,884
If it was the power cell, could
she fly?

496
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:20,344
I can't find anything else
wrong.

497
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:23,014
But we don't have a power cell. It's time
to figure out how we're going to live here.

498
00:45:23,015 --> 00:45:24,390
Look man I'm going home.

499
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:26,559
Frank, We can't make antimatter
here.

500
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,062
We don't need to make antimatter. Power
cell's are designed to withstand anything.

501
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:31,772
Right? Even a crash.

502
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:34,108
Yeah it it were to rupture. It
would be "Boom".

503
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:37,612
So the AE didn't blow up. Her
power cell is still intact.

504
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:39,947
(Everyone talking at once) -You
don't know what they're like.

505
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:41,365
Why not?

506
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:43,284
(Everyone talking at once)
- We're lost.

507
00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:46,287
You know I'll follow you
anywhere but that sounds crazy.

508
00:45:46,288 --> 00:45:47,872
Come on man.

509
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:50,959
No, Frank. We've been in flight
for a very long time.

510
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:55,339
That thing is back. It's got
TIM.

511
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:57,883
Dammit!

512
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:03,889
Alright dragon. Let's find your
weak spot.

513
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:06,892
(Yells)

514
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:30,999
Good Job.

515
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:33,167
You risked your life to save me.

516
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:34,877
You did the same for us.

517
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:37,672
I am programmed to assist and
protect humans.

518
00:46:37,673 --> 00:46:41,634
You risked your life for me. For
a machine.

519
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:44,012
You're more then a machine.

520
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:52,771
You are one crazy, heroic,
son of a bitch.

521
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:15,127
What is "Altus Exodus"?

522
00:47:18,714 --> 00:47:26,053
It's a moronic slogan they made up for the
evacuation, to make it seem less cowardly.

523
00:47:26,054 --> 00:47:28,807
It means, "The high noble
departure".

524
00:47:35,564 --> 00:47:40,444
In the unit we use to say "Up,
up, and away".

525
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,239
You risked your life?

526
00:47:46,074 --> 00:47:50,579
For a member of my unit... my
family.

527
00:47:57,377 --> 00:47:59,129
It was the right thing to do.

528
00:48:00,422 --> 00:48:03,467
If we don't protect each other,
we'll all die alone.

529
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:07,095
We are family now?

530
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:13,936
Do you have other family? In
your world?

531
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,148
A... mate?

532
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,026
Umm-

533
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:23,737
I have a wife.

534
00:48:25,614 --> 00:48:28,951
She's gone. She left before the
attack.

535
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:34,790
But I have a daughter.

536
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:37,501
She's 5 now.

537
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:44,550
Probably older.

538
00:48:49,388 --> 00:48:51,014
I have to get back to her.

539
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:55,185
I promised her I'd be back.

540
00:49:01,817 --> 00:49:05,988
If we get the power cell,
will you leave?

541
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:10,075
You can come with us.

542
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:18,584
But that might not happen because without
anybody's help we're not going anywhere.

543
00:49:19,877 --> 00:49:21,587
I got your back Frank.

544
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,633
Me too. Let's get out of here.

545
00:49:27,467 --> 00:49:29,178
I'm with you Frank.

546
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,015
I'm in.

547
00:49:34,558 --> 00:49:37,102
I would be happy to assist you.

548
00:49:41,482 --> 00:49:43,192
Family.

549
00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:48,155
Yeah.

550
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:50,699
Yeah.

551
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:06,923
- Good Morning Cassie.
- Good Morning. Where is Frank?

552
00:50:06,924 --> 00:50:10,051
I thought we were all going for
the power cell together.

553
00:50:10,052 --> 00:50:12,179
Frank and Lea went to get water.

554
00:50:24,525 --> 00:50:25,901
It's beautiful.

555
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,587
What are you looking at?

556
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:48,006
Beautiful.

557
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:52,468
Is this a tattoo?

558
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:54,721
Some sort of rite of passage?

559
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,765
Tattoo?

560
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:00,811
What?

561
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:10,821
Lea?

562
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:13,115
Lea?

563
00:51:14,324 --> 00:51:15,909
Ahh!

564
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:18,430
That looks like everything.

565
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:29,441
What?

566
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:35,446
You all sure about this?

567
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:36,781
Come on Frank.

568
00:52:36,782 --> 00:52:38,825
It's too dangerous. We're
leaving.

569
00:52:38,826 --> 00:52:42,703
Of course we got to get back to AE.
Without being caught by chameleons.

570
00:52:42,704 --> 00:52:44,039
Or something worse.

571
00:52:44,206 --> 00:52:47,333
Yeah. And getting here almost
killed us.

572
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:51,128
We should take the river. It will be a lot
easier than going through that jungle again.

573
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:52,547
And probably a lot safer.

574
00:52:52,548 --> 00:52:54,340
- Well let's say that we get there.
- Right.

575
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:56,676
There aren't enough of us for an
assault.

576
00:52:56,677 --> 00:52:58,720
I had an Idea about that.

577
00:52:59,221 --> 00:53:01,223
Would your people help us?

578
00:53:20,409 --> 00:53:21,577
Are you alright?

579
00:53:25,247 --> 00:53:27,875
I'm glad something good has come
out of all of this.

580
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:31,003
I think Frank is a very good
man.

581
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:34,715
What is it?

582
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:39,260
What is... "Tattoo"?

583
00:53:39,261 --> 00:53:47,261
(All singing) ♪ It's a long was to Tipperary.
To the sweetest girl I know. ♪

584
00:53:50,105 --> 00:53:58,105
♪ Goodbye Piccadilly. Farewell Leicester Square.
It's a long long way to Tipperary ♪

585
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:06,121
♪ My heart is still there.

586
00:54:07,956 --> 00:54:10,583
What does it mean? Tipperary?

587
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:12,044
No idea.

588
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:14,004
Are we there yet?

589
00:54:18,759 --> 00:54:21,260
Did you ever consider that the
filed was being bombed?

590
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:27,017
If you'd stayed you would have been blown up.
So in a way I saved your life.

591
00:54:28,477 --> 00:54:31,313
The village is far bu there is
and entrance near.

592
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:35,317
The not used way.

593
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:37,860
Back door?

594
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:43,826
Back door. Long walk in dark, Under mountain.
Chameleons don't go underground.

595
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:45,661
So we'll be safe inside.

596
00:54:45,994 --> 00:54:52,000
Never safe. Never all safe. The
people will not want to help us.

597
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:55,962
The chameleons hunt them kill
them.

598
00:54:55,963 --> 00:54:59,465
Maybe if we give the Chameleons a bloody
nose they will leave your people alone.

599
00:54:59,466 --> 00:55:00,676
Come on. Let's go.

600
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:02,386
Stay close.

601
00:56:06,074 --> 00:56:07,534
There's something back here.

602
00:56:08,827 --> 00:56:10,120
Just ignore them.

603
00:56:13,916 --> 00:56:15,584
(Screams)

604
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:27,012
The village is in the next
cavern.

605
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,556
I can't go in.

606
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:34,394
You know what, we need you to
translate.

607
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:45,280
What's wrong?

608
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:51,411
This is where I use to hide. To
listen...

609
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:56,291
Sometimes my mother would leave
me food.

610
00:56:58,418 --> 00:57:00,546
They caught her and...

611
00:57:03,006 --> 00:57:03,550
(Crying)

612
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:11,181
These are not my people.
(Sigh)

613
00:57:12,224 --> 00:57:13,559
I don't have people.

614
00:57:17,729 --> 00:57:23,068
I was - I don't know know words.
Sent away?

615
00:57:24,027 --> 00:57:25,487
Banished?

616
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:31,245
(Crying)

617
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,541
They called me a monster.

618
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:41,378
When child born like me.

619
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:49,636
(Sigh)
They take into jungle to die.

620
00:57:53,223 --> 00:57:55,601
They say if I ever come back I'm
killed.

621
00:57:57,352 --> 00:57:59,688
Why would anybody call you a
monster?

622
00:58:00,772 --> 00:58:05,360
(Cries) Not "Tattoo"

623
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:07,696
I don't have tattoo.

624
00:58:14,036 --> 00:58:16,705
You are the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen.

625
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:26,882
Why did you bring us here if you
knew you couldn't go in?

626
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:30,427
You only people who ever see
past...

627
00:58:34,556 --> 00:58:35,474
Ok.

628
00:58:39,353 --> 00:58:41,062
Did you learn their language?

629
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:42,356
No.

630
00:58:44,024 --> 00:58:45,484
I can speak to them.

631
00:58:46,026 --> 00:58:48,237
If Lea will teach me the words.

632
00:58:50,572 --> 00:58:54,159
Many languages have similar
sentence structure.

633
00:58:57,579 --> 00:58:58,747
I'll teach.

634
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:02,751
I'll teach.

635
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:15,263

639
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:30,570
He suggests they kill us, that we're

Thahessoom lin Kamelonas

641
00:59:35,117 --> 00:59:39,871
He says we must be with the Chameleons.
This isn't going well.

642
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:44,000
Tell them what Lea taught you, that
together we'll kill the Chameleons so

643
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:45,459
they can live in peace.

650
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:10,943
Yey. Yaliff.

651
01:00:10,944 --> 01:00:12,528
Yes. I live.

But thanks to these visitors I

654
01:00:20,037 --> 01:00:21,204
What are you doing?

655
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:23,206
The right thing.

656
01:00:23,207 --> 01:00:26,459
Hasim to humm weymish kessil.

657
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:30,421

a far off world.

Shelesteyfa. Hasim pash

659
01:00:33,926 --> 01:00:37,053
Abomination. It is death for you
to come here.

660
01:00:37,054 --> 01:00:41,557
Is that what you do? You kill
what you don't understand?

661
01:00:41,558 --> 01:00:44,769
What are you afraid of? A little
baby with colored skin?

662
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:50,441

666
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:09,919
This man killed many Chameleons
after the crash.

667
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,713
How many of you would be dead no
if it were not for him?

668
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:15,550
Sin amin tukasim rey sellafas.

669
01:01:15,551 --> 01:01:17,802
And now you won't help him
defeat your enemies.

670
01:01:17,803 --> 01:01:21,055
Thooish loos nik mua? Sashoon

671
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:25,561
Stop living in fear. It's time
to do what must be done.

672
01:01:45,914 --> 01:01:49,208
<i>(TIM translating the QUEEN) It is said that our
people have collected and guarded these down</i>

673
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:53,629
<i>through the ages. Some stolen from
the Chameleons. Some passed down</i>

674
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:59,594
from the dark times. Awaiting a day to strike.
The Chameleons still hold many of our people

675
01:01:59,595 --> 01:02:03,681
<i>as slaves. We will help you, if
you help us.</i>

676
01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:05,559
We'll do it together.

677
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:20,698
So this is how they disappeared
so quickly after the crash.

678
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:22,408
Yeah.

679
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:29,707

He say tat there is about a
hundred Chameleons.

681
01:02:32,669 --> 01:02:34,630
There may be more.

682
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:37,633
So what's the plan.

683
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:42,012
We need a diversion. We get back
to basics. Come on.

684
01:02:46,225 --> 01:02:54,225

01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:01,800
(Whistles)

687
01:04:06,555 --> 01:04:08,097
So you really think this is
gonna work?

688
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:11,893
These are zookeepers or
scientist, not soldiers.

689
01:04:11,894 --> 01:04:14,229
Even if they were, who would
they be fighting?

690
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:17,106
The humanoids would never attack
them.

691
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:18,650
Hope you're right.

692
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:25,657
Fire!

693
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:32,039
(Explosion)

694
01:04:42,674 --> 01:04:44,635
Ok. Let's go.

695
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:50,556
Come on!

696
01:04:50,557 --> 01:04:52,851
Let's get out of here and find
your friends.

697
01:05:07,491 --> 01:05:10,077
(Animal Cry)

698
01:06:00,711 --> 01:06:02,004
(Whispers) Hey.

699
01:06:21,857 --> 01:06:24,776
What happend? Where did they go?

700
01:06:28,572 --> 01:06:30,782
Ok. Ok. Ok.

701
01:06:34,703 --> 01:06:36,246
It's still energized.

702
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:42,252
Uh-That will work.

703
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:49,551
Look, we'll have to look for
them.

704
01:06:49,927 --> 01:06:52,220
Hope our diversion's still
working.

705
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:54,055
We're going to risk our lives
for them?

706
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:56,725
That's what they are doing for
us.

707
01:06:57,893 --> 01:07:02,731
Fine. Let's get this over with.

708
01:07:03,524 --> 01:07:04,900
Foot prints.

709
01:07:16,245 --> 01:07:17,913
Go. Go. Go. Go.

710
01:07:23,794 --> 01:07:25,586
Go. I got your back.

711
01:07:25,587 --> 01:07:26,671
What?

712
01:07:26,672 --> 01:07:28,090
Go on. I'll catch up.

713
01:07:30,217 --> 01:07:32,261
It's my turn to be a heroic son
of a bitch.

714
01:07:34,096 --> 01:07:34,972
Go!

715
01:07:35,889 --> 01:07:37,141
I got this.

716
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,978
What your 6.

717
01:07:58,287 --> 01:07:59,912
(Laughs)

718
01:07:59,913 --> 01:08:02,457
I guess I'll be taking that
fancy gun of yours.

719
01:08:17,264 --> 01:08:17,764
(Groan)

720
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:33,989
Lea?

721
01:08:43,832 --> 01:08:46,209
(Screams)

722
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:47,377
Lea no!

723
01:08:48,045 --> 01:08:49,004
Lea!

724
01:09:00,641 --> 01:09:02,267
- Oh no.
- Oh no.

725
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:12,194
Down!

726
01:09:35,384 --> 01:09:38,011
(Gun fire)

727
01:09:55,237 --> 01:09:56,530
Lea.

728
01:10:21,889 --> 01:10:24,223
(Gun fire)

729
01:10:24,224 --> 01:10:27,269
No what? We're sitting ducks.

730
01:10:35,277 --> 01:10:38,947
Well bulid uh-We'll build a
plasma field.

731
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:41,949
The Jungle version. A Wall of
fire.

732
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:44,119
Methane. Shoot the ground.

733
01:10:45,454 --> 01:10:47,455
(Gun fire)

734
01:10:47,456 --> 01:10:49,833
(Explosion)

735
01:11:13,899 --> 01:11:15,400
Lea.

736
01:11:19,112 --> 01:11:20,489
You alright?

737
01:11:21,698 --> 01:11:23,157
I'm ok.

738
01:11:23,158 --> 01:11:25,244
Are you crazy? You could have
been killed.

739
01:11:27,996 --> 01:11:29,998
TIM. Come on.

740
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:33,168
Here.

741
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:42,009
I regret I am unable to assist
you at this time.

742
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:43,177
You saved my life.

743
01:11:43,178 --> 01:11:44,638
That is my purpose.

744
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:47,056
Is the power cell damaged.

745
01:11:47,057 --> 01:11:48,891
If it were, none of us would be
here.

746
01:11:48,892 --> 01:11:50,560
- Take it and go.
- What?

747
01:11:50,561 --> 01:11:53,312
I would be happy to perform one
last piece of assistance.

748
01:11:53,313 --> 01:11:56,440
I will wait for our pursuers and
then self-destruct.

749
01:11:56,441 --> 01:11:58,693
It should be a significant
explosion.

750
01:11:58,694 --> 01:12:00,779
No. We'll take you with us.

751
01:12:01,738 --> 01:12:04,198
I cannot allow you to endanger
yourself for me again.

752
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:06,201
You don't have any choice.

753
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:09,329
Let's get the hell off this
planet.

754
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:19,006
Come on.

755
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:24,428
Take, Take him. Take him.

756
01:12:25,304 --> 01:12:26,388
Grab him.

757
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:27,889
Where's Peebles?

758
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:29,516
He was with you.

759
01:12:29,683 --> 01:12:32,226
Keep going. Move! Move!
Go Go Go!

760
01:12:32,227 --> 01:12:40,227
- Here take this. - I'll catch up.
- You'll need this.

761
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:47,700
Damn. This will never work.

762
01:12:47,701 --> 01:12:49,995
We'll lead them right back to
the cave.

763
01:12:53,248 --> 01:12:56,709
Captain. Take TIM and the
others.

764
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:59,629
Back through the Mountain. Get
to the ship.

765
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:00,713
You'll be killed.

766
01:13:00,714 --> 01:13:02,215
I'm dying on earth not here.

767
01:13:02,216 --> 01:13:03,424
I'll come with you.

768
01:13:03,425 --> 01:13:06,261
The more people the better the
decoy.

769
01:13:07,429 --> 01:13:10,432
Alright. Move on 2. 1...2.

770
01:13:12,184 --> 01:13:17,022
Are you sure about this? There could be more
then a few Chameleons zookeepers out there.

771
01:13:18,941 --> 01:13:21,401
We'll head for the river. Find
us.

772
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:23,903
- Alright.
- Go!

773
01:13:23,904 --> 01:13:25,113
Go!

774
01:13:29,409 --> 01:13:32,078
- Don't you want me?
- What are you doing?

775
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:33,371
Of course I want you.

776
01:13:33,372 --> 01:13:35,790
You belong here with your
people.

777
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:37,376
You are my people.

778
01:13:41,129 --> 01:13:44,049
Alright. Ready? Go. 1, 2.

779
01:13:46,134 --> 01:13:48,554
Follow me. There's a boat!

780
01:13:53,684 --> 01:13:55,144
There it is!

781
01:14:02,901 --> 01:14:04,027
Get in.

782
01:14:28,969 --> 01:14:31,054
Colin where's the power cell?

783
01:14:32,764 --> 01:14:34,391
Looks like we lost them.

784
01:14:39,646 --> 01:14:41,273
That wasn't so bad.

785
01:14:47,779 --> 01:14:48,864
Dammit.

786
01:14:49,615 --> 01:14:51,533
I was hopping they only had one
of those.

787
01:14:56,371 --> 01:14:58,248
Colin where are you?

788
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:05,631
(Gun fire)

789
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:46,338
Paddle Paddle Paddle!

790
01:15:52,094 --> 01:15:53,512
(Screams)

791
01:15:58,725 --> 01:16:00,477
(Screaming)

792
01:16:09,736 --> 01:16:11,947
Give me your hand. Give me your
hand.

793
01:16:13,157 --> 01:16:14,825
(Gasp)

794
01:16:48,317 --> 01:16:49,443
(Screams)

795
01:17:10,214 --> 01:17:11,423
Pull.

796
01:17:18,055 --> 01:17:19,013
You took your time.

797
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:20,097
Good to see ya.

798
01:17:20,098 --> 01:17:21,850
Altus Exodus?

799
01:17:24,937 --> 01:17:26,563
Come on!

800
01:17:28,941 --> 01:17:32,402
(Gun fire)

801
01:17:48,752 --> 01:17:51,212
Well that explains why we
crashed.

802
01:17:51,213 --> 01:17:53,257
Some kind of planetary defense
system.

803
01:17:53,549 --> 01:17:54,799
Probably automated.

804
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,886
I'll take a few moments for the
computer to figure out where er are.

805
01:17:58,887 --> 01:18:00,012
Alright.

806
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:02,348
(Beep)

807
01:18:02,349 --> 01:18:04,393
Problem?

808
01:18:05,352 --> 01:18:06,854
This doesn't make sense.

809
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:10,149
Nothing is where it should be.

810
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:12,860
I my have the answer to that
this time.

811
01:18:14,444 --> 01:18:19,323
We arrived at Barnard's Star after a
flight time approximately 10 years.

812
01:18:19,324 --> 01:18:21,033
What?

813
01:18:21,034 --> 01:18:24,328
No habitable planets were
observed, so we continued on.

814
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:27,748
Eventually reaching more then 99
percent the speed of light.

815
01:18:27,749 --> 01:18:32,879
Several other systems were also uninhabitable
and with Cryo liability limited to

816
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:39,802
100 years, I instructed the ship to initiate
a return trajectory hopes to whatever the

817
01:18:39,803 --> 01:18:43,098
outcomes of the war, Earth might
still be habitable.

818
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:49,061
You're saying we've been gone a 100 years?
And we crashed on some habitable planet

819
01:18:49,062 --> 01:18:50,354
on the way back to Earth?

820
01:18:50,355 --> 01:18:57,778
Relativity is a bitch Frank. It's been 100 years for us.
But on Earth it has been...

821
01:18:57,779 --> 01:19:02,241
Approximately 325,000 years have
passed here.

822
01:19:02,242 --> 01:19:05,078
Wait? Here?

823
01:19:05,454 --> 01:19:08,415
The AE successfully returned
home.

824
01:19:13,295 --> 01:19:19,384
That's not Earth. Earth is blue. And
what about that ring around it?

825
01:19:20,135 --> 01:19:21,345
We're the moon?

826
01:19:21,929 --> 01:19:24,680
I would suggest the alien
invaders destroyed it.

827
01:19:24,681 --> 01:19:26,641
The ring is the debris left
behind.

828
01:19:26,642 --> 01:19:28,601
Why would they destroy the moon?

829
01:19:28,602 --> 01:19:33,314
With no tidal influence, the surface
of the world would grow flatter.

830
01:19:33,315 --> 01:19:37,485
And with the runaway greenhouse effect, the
planet would eventually become covered

831
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:41,697
in tropical jungle and shallow
seas.

832
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:44,159
Perfect for a race of
Chameleons.

833
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:48,955
- Why didn't you tell us!? Huh?
- FRANK!

834
01:19:48,956 --> 01:19:53,669
Peebles and Hannah and all the rest.
They died trying to get home.

835
01:19:54,336 --> 01:19:57,798
When all this time there was
nowhere to go. Was there?

836
01:19:58,173 --> 01:20:00,092
- Frank.
- What there?!

837
01:20:00,759 --> 01:20:05,180
If I had told you, will you've
had the will to go on?

838
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:14,689
My programming shows that a
goal, a reason to live is one of

839
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:18,651
the most critical factors in
human happiness.

840
01:20:18,652 --> 01:20:21,697
So you were trying to make us
happy.

841
01:20:24,241 --> 01:20:25,909
He didn't have the heart.

842
01:20:27,452 --> 01:20:28,704
What?

843
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,751
He's saying he didn't have the
heart to tell us.

844
01:20:41,258 --> 01:20:43,427
I- I promised her.

845
01:20:48,015 --> 01:20:49,558
Your people...

846
01:20:54,396 --> 01:20:55,647
You're us.

847
01:20:58,275 --> 01:21:02,154
Lea's skin is may be the next
step in human evolution.

848
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:08,160
We can't go home Frank. We're
already there.

849
01:21:12,998 --> 01:21:14,666
Yes we are.

850
01:21:15,792 --> 01:21:17,293
And we are going to have to
adapt.

851
01:21:17,294 --> 01:21:18,587
How?

852
01:21:20,756 --> 01:21:22,925
We're going to take back our
world.

853
01:21:24,968 --> 01:21:28,597
It's going to be a long long
fight.

854
01:21:29,932 --> 01:21:35,145
Yeah. But there is no place like
home.
