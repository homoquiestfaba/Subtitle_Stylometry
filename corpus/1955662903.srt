181
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:24,945
-You paying the bills OK?</font>

182
00:08:24,944 --> 00:08:26,446
-Yeah, I mean, I get by.</font>

183
00:08:26,446 --> 00:08:27,948
You know.</font>

184
00:08:27,947 --> 00:08:28,364
I'm--</font>

185
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:29,949
I'm not rich, but--</font>

186
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:34,955
-Let me ask you something.</font>

187
00:08:34,954 --> 00:08:35,955
When you--</font>

188
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:39,459
when you go to collect
 money, right, like--</font>

189
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:40,460
how-- how's it go down?</font>

190
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,429
Like, how does that work?</font>

191
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:44,463
-What-- what do you mean?</font>

192
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:46,967
-Well, like, does it always
    have to get violent?</font>

193
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:50,470
Can you sometimes maybe
    talk to them, or</font>

194
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,972
like, intimidate them?</font>

195
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:52,472
I don't know.</font>

196
00:08:52,472 --> 00:08:53,473
I'm asking.</font>

197
00:08:53,473 --> 00:08:53,974
-You owe me some money, buddy.</font>

198
00:08:53,973 --> 00:08:54,974
Remember?</font>

199
00:08:54,974 --> 00:08:55,975
You have a gambling problem.</font>

200
00:08:55,975 --> 00:08:56,476
Time to pay.</font>

201
00:08:56,976 --> 00:08:57,477
Why-- no--</font>

202
00:08:57,477 --> 00:08:58,979
I don't-- why you asking?</font>

203
00:08:58,978 --> 00:08:59,979
-No, I'm just--</font>

204
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:01,981
-Are you, like, researching
    a book or something?</font>

205
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:02,732
What--</font>

206
00:09:02,732 --> 00:09:03,816
-No, no.</font>

207
00:09:05,618 --> 00:09:07,203
-What's going on?</font>

208
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:13,659
-I'm in trouble, man.</font>

209
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:14,577
-OK.</font>

210
00:09:17,663 --> 00:09:22,668
-We got an eviction notice this
     morning, and, uh, if I</font>

211
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:25,671
don't pay in a few days, we're
   gonna be on the street.</font>

212
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:27,674
-Fuck.</font>

213
00:09:27,673 --> 00:09:30,176
-I don't have a job since,
 like, an hour ago, so--</font>

214
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:31,728
-I'm sorry, man.</font>

215
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,180
Look, I--</font>

216
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:36,732
I can help you out.</font>

217
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:37,733
I got a couple hundred bucks.</font>

218
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:43,822
-Look, I need 4,500.</font>

219
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:46,326
-Yeah, that's-- that's a little
       rich for my blood.</font>

220
00:09:49,362 --> 00:09:51,831
So that's-- that's why
    you're asking?</font>

221
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:52,281
You're looking for work?</font>

222
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:53,282
-Oh, no, no, no.</font>

223
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:55,368
No, just curious.</font>

224
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:56,953
-Yeah.</font>

225
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:04,461
You know, Craig, I once broke a
  guy's arm for $80 while his</font>

226
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,962
daughter watched.</font>

227
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:10,967
You think you're capable of
 doing something like that?</font>

228
00:10:21,777 --> 00:10:23,279
God, don't get so heavy.</font>

229
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:23,780
-I'm not.</font>

230
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,781
I'm cool.</font>

231
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:27,283
-My god, you got so depressed
  over the last five years.</font>

232
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:28,201
-No, it's good.</font>

233
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:28,735
It's good.</font>

234
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:29,786
I, uh--</font>

235
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:31,287
I'm gonna go drain.</font>

236
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:32,238
-All right.</font>

237
00:10:32,238 --> 00:10:33,239
-I'll be right back.</font>

238
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:34,290
-Yeah.</font>

239
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,292
Craig Daniels.</font>

240
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:39,295
Craig Daniels.</font>

241
00:10:39,295 --> 00:10:40,797
God damn.</font>

242
00:10:48,387 --> 00:10:51,557
[snorting]</font>

243
00:10:51,557 --> 00:10:53,426
-Sorry.</font>

244
00:10:53,426 --> 00:10:54,928
What's up?</font>

245
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:25,341
-Hey Craig.</font>

246
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:27,343
These guys want to buy
 the next round, man.</font>

247
00:11:27,343 --> 00:11:28,544
Come on, saddle up.</font>

248
00:11:34,016 --> 00:11:38,938
They were just looking
for a little company.</font>

249
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:39,439
-Hey.</font>

250
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:40,940
Party, party.</font>

251
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:45,945
Cool.</font>

252
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:47,029
All right.</font>

253
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:47,947
You guys like tequila?</font>

254
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:48,281
-Um, yeah.</font>

255
00:11:48,864 --> 00:11:49,865
Yeah, sure.</font>

256
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:52,901
-Bartender, three shots of your
    finest tequila, please.</font>

257
00:11:52,902 --> 00:11:53,903
You know-- wait-- hold--</font>

258
00:11:53,903 --> 00:11:55,405
I'm sorry.</font>

259
00:11:55,404 --> 00:11:57,623
Uh, just, matter of fact, give
     me the whole bottle.</font>

260
00:11:57,623 --> 00:11:58,124
And the cranberry juice.</font>

261
00:11:58,708 --> 00:11:59,209
-Yeah?</font>

262
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,042
What are your names?</font>

263
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:00,910
-I'm Colin.</font>

264
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,411
This is my wife, Violet.</font>

265
00:12:01,911 --> 00:12:02,412
-Hey, how you doing?</font>

266
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:02,878
I'm Vince.</font>

267
00:12:02,878 --> 00:12:03,212
-Vince?</font>

268
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:04,296
All right.</font>

269
00:12:04,797 --> 00:12:05,214
-Craig.</font>

270
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:06,549
-Craig.</font>

271
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:07,550
It's Violet's birthday today,
      so we thought we'd</font>

272
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,551
go out on the town.</font>

273
00:12:08,551 --> 00:12:09,052
You know, get a little crazy.</font>

274
00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:10,052
-Happy birthday.</font>

275
00:12:10,052 --> 00:12:10,469
-Right?</font>

276
00:12:10,469 --> 00:12:10,803
-Thanks.</font>

277
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:11,837
There she is.</font>

278
00:12:11,837 --> 00:12:12,388
Put it right there.</font>

279
00:12:12,388 --> 00:12:13,890
-You sure?</font>

280
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:14,890
This is a $300 bottle
     of tequila.</font>

281
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,891
-Oh, my.</font>

282
00:12:15,891 --> 00:12:16,842
Oh, this is embarrassing.</font>

283
00:12:16,842 --> 00:12:17,843
Uh--</font>

284
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:20,179
uh-- yeah, it's fine.</font>

285
00:12:20,763 --> 00:12:21,264
What's your name?</font>

286
00:12:21,264 --> 00:12:22,482
-Caren.</font>

287
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:23,065
-Caren with a K or a C?</font>

288
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:24,067
-C.</font>

289
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,235
-There you go, Caren with a C.</font>

290
00:12:26,235 --> 00:12:27,319
-Thanks.</font>

291
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,104
-The glasses come with?</font>

292
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:28,855
Oh, good.</font>

293
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:37,530
Gentlemen.</font>

294
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,334
To my amazing wife, Violet.</font>

295
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:45,839
The past six months have been
     so fucking awesome.</font>

296
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:48,341
I love the shit out of you.</font>

297
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:50,343
-Love you too.</font>

298
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:51,845
-All right, to Violet.</font>

299
00:12:54,096 --> 00:12:55,097
Oh.</font>

300
00:12:55,097 --> 00:12:56,599
God damn.</font>

301
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:57,550
-That's smooth.</font>

302
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,601
-Yeah, it's all right.</font>

303
00:12:58,601 --> 00:12:59,552
I have this bottle at home.</font>

304
00:12:59,552 --> 00:13:00,636
It used to belong
 to Pancho Villa.</font>

305
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:03,139
It cost me, like,
  what, $10,000.</font>

306
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:03,640
-What?</font>

307
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,191
-Yeah, isn't that crazy?</font>

308
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:06,776
Uh, so anyway-- what do
 you guys-- what do you</font>

309
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:08,361
guys do for a living?</font>

310
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:10,813
Do you, like, uh, work at
 a car wash or something?</font>

311
00:13:10,813 --> 00:13:12,865
-Oh, you mean because
 of the monkey suit?</font>

312
00:13:12,865 --> 00:13:14,367
-Well, I didn't-- no offense.</font>

313
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,368
I assumed manager.</font>

314
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:16,202
-No, no, no.</font>

315
00:13:16,202 --> 00:13:18,287
We're just old friends
     catching up,</font>

316
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:19,288
having a couple of drinks.</font>

317
00:13:19,288 --> 00:13:20,039
-Right on.</font>

318
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,624
Old friends is good.</font>

319
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:22,575
-Yeah.</font>

320
00:13:22,575 --> 00:13:23,543
No, we used to skateboard
        together.</font>

321
00:13:24,043 --> 00:13:25,545
We played music in
   high school.</font>

322
00:13:25,544 --> 00:13:26,462
-You guys go way deep.</font>

323
00:13:26,462 --> 00:13:27,046
-Yeah.</font>

324
00:13:27,046 --> 00:13:27,880
Yeah.</font>

325
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,130
No, simpler times.</font>

326
00:13:28,714 --> 00:13:29,215
Yep.</font>

327
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,667
-Occasionally.</font>

328
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:32,668
-Mystery man.</font>

329
00:13:32,668 --> 00:13:33,169
Occasionally.</font>

330
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:34,170
Ber.</font>

331
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,138
Bum.</font>

332
00:13:35,137 --> 00:13:36,722
You should be wearing a suit
  and a tie or something.</font>

333
00:13:36,722 --> 00:13:38,557
This guy-- ruh-ruh
   ruh-ruh-ruh.</font>

334
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:40,426
A very proper man.</font>

335
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:41,894
Oh, uh, Violet--</font>

336
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:43,345
we should, uh, take
   some candids.</font>

337
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:44,347
Take some-- take
 some pictures.</font>

338
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:45,598
We should document this, right?</font>

339
00:13:45,598 --> 00:13:46,482
-OK--</font>

340
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:47,984
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Come on.</font>

341
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:49,485
-All right, you want to
  take some pictures?</font>

342
00:13:49,485 --> 00:13:49,986
OK.</font>

343
00:13:49,985 --> 00:13:50,486
Yeah, sure.</font>

344
00:13:50,986 --> 00:13:51,987
-Say cheese.</font>

345
00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:53,489
-Cheese.</font>

346
00:13:53,489 --> 00:13:55,574
Oh god, that's bright.</font>

347
00:13:55,574 --> 00:13:56,325
Oh.</font>

348
00:13:56,325 --> 00:13:56,909
-Let me get in there.</font>

349
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:58,411
-You want another one?</font>

350
00:13:58,411 --> 00:13:58,995
OK.</font>

351
00:13:59,995 --> 00:14:00,445
-Here we go.</font>

352
00:14:00,446 --> 00:14:01,414
-One, two, three.</font>

353
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:02,498
-All right.</font>

354
00:14:02,498 --> 00:14:04,033
Did you take it?</font>

355
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:05,535
How's it look?</font>

356

00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,794
-Come on, Craig.</font>

705
00:28:08,793 --> 00:28:10,762
Come on, you got a little
       patched up?</font>

706
00:28:15,634 --> 00:28:17,136
Move it, buddy.</font>

707
00:28:17,636 --> 00:28:19,638
Ooh.</font>

708
00:28:19,638 --> 00:28:21,106
-Killer view, right?</font>

709
00:28:21,106 --> 00:28:22,608
-Yeah.</font>

710
00:28:22,607 --> 00:28:24,476
-Yeah, I have a-- another place
     by the water in Palos</font>

711
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,063
Verdes and a condo in Malibu.</font>

712
00:28:28,063 --> 00:28:29,064
But this is all--</font>

713
00:28:29,064 --> 00:28:31,033
this is all Violet's
  baby right here.</font>

714
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:34,452
I just gave her the checkbook
and I said, hey, whatever you</font>

715
00:28:34,452 --> 00:28:36,871
create are my desires.</font>

716
00:28:36,871 --> 00:28:37,989
And clearly she's
 doing it, right?</font>

717
00:28:37,989 --> 00:28:40,575
She put together every
     inch of it.</font>

718
00:28:43,578 --> 00:28:44,579
-What?</font>

719
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:51,336
Oh, what the fuck?</font>

720
00:28:51,336 --> 00:28:52,470
[laughter]</font>

721
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,055
-Fuck off.</font>

722
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:57,059
-Craig, wait, wait, wait, wait.</font>

723
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:58,060
Come here.</font>

724
00:28:58,059 --> 00:28:58,560
Don't be like that.</font>

725
00:28:59,010 --> 00:28:59,978
Come here, man.</font>

726
00:29:00,512 --> 00:29:02,514
Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig.</font>

727
00:29:02,514 --> 00:29:03,432
Wait, wait, wait, wait.</font>

728
00:29:03,431 --> 00:29:05,733
Stop, stop, stop.</font>

729
00:29:05,734 --> 00:29:06,735
-Oh, what are you gonna
 take a shit on me now?</font>

730
00:29:06,735 --> 00:29:08,237
Get the fuck out of here.</font>

731
00:29:08,236 --> 00:29:09,237
-Relax, man.</font>

732
00:29:09,237 --> 00:29:10,739
That was for $300, all right?</font>

733
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:11,740
You would have done the
   same exact thing.</font>

734
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,741
-Oh, yeah?</font>

735
00:29:12,741 --> 00:29:14,109
You think so?</font>

736
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,669
-I'm gonna rob him.</font>

737
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:25,753
-What?</font>

738
00:29:25,754 --> 00:29:26,455
-This fucking idiot has
    got a safe-full</font>

739
00:29:26,454 --> 00:29:27,538
of cash in his office.</font>

740
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,040
I'm gonna take it.</font>

741
00:29:34,546 --> 00:29:37,632
-Are you insane, you
    fucking ape?</font>

742
00:29:37,632 --> 00:29:39,634
I just want to get
   out of here.</font>

743
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:44,639
-There is, like, $150,000
    in cash in there.</font>

744
00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:46,691
Now, for him, that's a
 drop in the bucket.</font>

745
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:49,110
But for us, that's a whole
      new life, man.</font>

746
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,478
Think about it.</font>

747
00:29:50,478 --> 00:29:52,063
-I'm not gonna rob him.</font>

748
00:29:52,063 --> 00:29:53,448
-OK, fine.</font>

749
00:29:53,448 --> 00:29:57,702
That's fine, but the last time
 I checked you needed money.</font>

750
00:29:57,702 --> 00:29:59,287
This right here, this
 is your opportunity.</font>

751
00:29:59,738 --> 00:30:02,291
-Yeah, my opportunity
   to get arrested.</font>

752
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,658
He's seen our faces.</font>

753
00:30:03,658 --> 00:30:04,542
He knows our names.</font>

754
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:05,576
-He's not calling the cops.</font>

755
00:30:05,577 --> 00:30:06,745
He's not gonna call them.</font>

756
00:30:06,745 --> 00:30:10,332
-That is a really crazy
      assumption.</font>

757
00:30:10,582 --> 00:30:11,299
No, it's not.</font>

758
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:12,884
Not when you think about it.</font>

759
00:30:12,884 --> 00:30:15,887
Any fucking cop that isn't blind
      is going to take one</font>

760
00:30:15,887 --> 00:30:18,390
look at his dilated pupils and
   throw him in jail right</font>

761
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,391
alongside of us.</font>

762
00:30:19,891 --> 00:30:20,892
He's not calling the cops.</font>

763
00:30:24,979 --> 00:30:29,233
Now look, I'm doing
  this either way.</font>

764
00:30:29,234 --> 00:30:33,271
Now, if you don't want to be a
 part of it, you should leave</font>

765
00:30:33,271 --> 00:30:34,272
right fucking now.</font>

766
00:30:40,161 --> 00:30:41,913
-Wait, wait, wait.</font>

767
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:50,255
What am I supposed to do?</font>

768
00:30:50,255 --> 00:30:52,290
-Just hold the girl,
     all right?</font>

769
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,042
I'll take care of the rest.</font>

770
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:55,343
-You're not gonna hurt
    him, are you?</font>

771
00:30:55,343 --> 00:30:56,177
-No.</font>

772
00:30:56,177 --> 00:30:57,762
No, I'm not gonna fucking--</font>

773
00:30:57,762 --> 00:30:58,763
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): You guys
 jerking each other off in</font>

774
00:30:58,763 --> 00:30:59,764
there or something?</font>

775
00:31:00,265 --> 00:31:02,684
-Why, you want to come
  in here and watch?</font>

776
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:04,269
Nobody's getting hurt.</font>

777
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:06,688
Just grab violet and
   hold on tight.</font>

778
00:31:19,868 --> 00:31:23,205
-You bros kiss and make up?</font>

779
00:31:23,204 --> 00:31:24,155
-Yeah.</font>

780
00:31:24,155 --> 00:31:24,539
-Ding, ding.</font>

781
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:26,124
-Ooh.</font>

782
00:31:26,124 --> 00:31:28,410
-Violet's got all of her music
  hooked up with the stereo.</font>

783
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:31,413
So there's, like, 12,000
  tunes we can listen</font>

784
00:31:31,413 --> 00:31:32,214
to on shuffle, right?</font>

785
00:31:32,464 --> 00:31:34,549
Play that crazy instrumental
           honey.</font>

786
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:38,169
Oh you know, it's the one with
   the-- with the strings.</font>

787
00:31:38,636 --> 00:31:39,670
Ooh, or just play this one.</font>

788
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:41,173
This is actually the
    better vibe.</font>

789
00:31:41,172 --> 00:31:42,674
Better for the vibe, actually.</font>

790
00:31:42,674 --> 00:31:44,059
Here's your cocktail.</font>

791
00:31:44,058 --> 00:31:45,643
Uh, are you girls done
with the ladies room?</font>

792
00:31:46,144 --> 00:31:47,312
'Cause I gotta pee.</font>

793
00:31:47,812 --> 00:31:48,262
-Yeah.</font>

794
00:31:48,263 --> 00:31:48,847
Yeah.</font>

795
00:31:48,847 --> 00:31:51,016
Hey, uh, Colin--</font>

796
00:31:51,015 --> 00:31:54,018
well, I hate to do
   this to you.</font>

797
00:31:54,018 --> 00:31:55,403
-What the fuck, man?</font>

798
00:31:55,403 --> 00:31:56,905
-I'm gonna need all the
  money in that safe.</font>

799
00:31:56,905 --> 00:31:58,490
-Dude, this is fucking really
      stupid, all right?</font>

800
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,108
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</font>

801
00:32:00,108 --> 00:32:01,610
Now, you and I are gonna
    wait right here.</font>

802
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:03,077
Craig's gonna get
  it for us, OK?</font>

803
00:32:03,495 --> 00:32:04,579
What's the combination?</font>

804
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:05,330
-Combination?</font>

805
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:05,530
I--</font>

806
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,498
I--</font>

807
00:32:06,498 --> 00:32:06,832
I don't--</font>

808
00:32:07,415 --> 00:32:08,917
-Look, don't fuck with me, OK?</font>

809
00:32:08,917 --> 00:32:10,419
-Dude, you fucking
 gotta chill, OK?</font>

810
00:32:10,418 --> 00:32:12,587
We got a good party going
     here, all right?</font>

811
00:32:12,587 --> 00:32:14,506
-Tell me the combination.</font>

812
00:32:14,506 --> 00:32:17,592
-I told you, I don't know it.</font>

813
00:32:17,592 --> 00:32:18,593
It's not locked, Vince.</font>

814
00:32:19,093 --> 00:32:19,844
-You fucking shitting me?</font>

815
00:32:19,844 --> 00:32:21,846
You expect me to believe that?</font>

816
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:22,797
-I--</font>

817
00:32:22,797 --> 00:32:24,299
I can't remember the
numerical sequence.</font>

818
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:25,767
OK?</font>

819
00:32:26,301 --> 00:32:28,303
It was her birthday and then
I changed it to her social.</font>

820
00:32:28,803 --> 00:32:30,021
I can't-- it's not
 fucking locked.</font>

821
00:32:30,021 --> 00:32:32,607
-It's a safe-full of cash.</font>

822
00:32:32,607 --> 00:32:33,558
-Well, I guess I--</font>

823
00:32:34,108 --> 00:32:35,109
I, uh--</font>

824
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:38,112
I guess trust my bros
    too much, huh?</font>

825
00:32:38,112 --> 00:32:38,863
-You know what?</font>

826
00:32:38,863 --> 00:32:41,449
Hey Craig, you're gonna
      handle this.</font>

827
00:32:41,449 --> 00:32:42,450
Come here.</font>

828
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:42,951
Just walk over to the couch.</font>

829
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:43,452
Come on.</font>

830
00:32:43,952 --> 00:32:44,453
Sit down, sit down.</font>

831
00:32:44,452 --> 00:32:45,403
Sit down.</font>

832
00:32:45,954 --> 00:32:47,155
CRAIG (OFFSCREEN): What
   do I do with her?</font>

833
00:32:47,155 --> 00:32:47,739
-Just-- just put her on
 the couch next to him.</font>

834
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:48,240
-OK.</font>

835
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:51,242
Watch your--</font>

836
00:32:51,242 --> 00:32:52,744
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Don't
  do anything stupid.</font>

837
00:33:09,978 --> 00:33:10,979
-Uh-huh.</font>

838
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:11,930
All right.</font>

839
00:33:15,483 --> 00:33:16,484
Whoa.</font>

840
00:33:29,497 --> 00:33:30,415
-You keep it unlocked?</font>

841
00:33:30,415 --> 00:33:32,334
What are you, fucking stupid?</font>

842
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:33,334
Come on, bro.</font>

843
00:33:33,334 --> 00:33:34,335
Come on.</font>

844
00:33:55,356 --> 00:33:57,308
-Ah, fucking cock.</font>

845
00:33:57,308 --> 00:33:59,527
-What's taking so long, Craig?</font>

846
00:33:59,527 --> 00:34:00,445
-Give me a sec.</font>

847
00:34:12,707 --> 00:34:13,041
Let's go.</font>

848
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:13,792
I got it.</font>

849
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:14,659
-You got all of it?</font>

850
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:14,993
-Yeah, yeah.</font>

851
00:34:14,993 --> 00:34:15,911
Come on.</font>

852
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,828
-How much was in there?</font>

853
00:34:16,828 --> 00:34:17,329
-I don't know.</font>

854
00:34:17,328 --> 00:34:18,246
I didn't count it.</font>

855
00:34:18,246 --> 00:34:19,214
Let's get the fuck
   out of here.</font>

856
00:34:19,213 --> 00:34:19,663
-All right.</font>

857
00:34:20,131 --> 00:34:20,965
Yeah.</font>

858
00:34:20,965 --> 00:34:21,749
You know what, Colin?</font>

859
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,551
I'm also gonna need
  those car keys.</font>

860
00:34:23,551 --> 00:34:25,503
-Oh, uh, I think they're on the
    shelf right over there.</font>

861
00:34:34,729 --> 00:34:36,814
-Fucking cool it.</font>

862
00:34:36,814 --> 00:34:38,432
Take a fucking moment.</font>

863
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:41,603
-I just want to say, this
     was not my idea.</font>

864
00:34:41,603 --> 00:34:42,521
He came up with the idea.</font>

865
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,938
I told him it was a bad idea.</font>

866
00:34:43,938 --> 00:34:45,156
-Shut it.</font>

867
00:34:45,156 --> 00:34:47,608
Let's all just chill for a
fucking moment, all right?</font>

868
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:48,527
Let's hit pause.</font>

869
00:34:48,526 --> 00:34:49,077
-(MUFFLED) Yeah.</font>

870
00:34:49,611 --> 00:34:50,612
-OK.</font>

871
00:34:50,612 --> 00:34:51,446
-Want to?</font>

872
00:34:51,446 --> 00:34:52,030
-Yeah.</font>

873
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,998
-Hey, how about we pretend?</font>

874
00:34:53,448 --> 00:34:54,366
You want to pretend something?</font>

875
00:34:54,365 --> 00:34:55,366
Let's-- let's pretend.</font>

876
00:34:55,867 --> 00:34:56,785
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): You're
      fake bullies.</font>

877
00:34:56,784 --> 00:34:57,285
COLIN (OFFSCREEN):
 Yeah, that's it.</font>

878
00:34:57,869 --> 00:34:58,536
Good, Vince.</font>

879
00:34:58,536 --> 00:34:59,120
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): OK.</font>

880
00:35:01,923 --> 00:35:06,928
-Let's just pretend these
  last 15 minutes didn't</font>

881
00:35:06,928 --> 00:35:08,430
even happen, all right?</font>

882
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:09,431
-What do you mean, dude?</font>

883
00:35:09,847 --> 00:35:10,681
We just tried to rob you.</font>

884
00:35:10,682 --> 00:35:12,133
-Yeah, that was really
    fucking lame.</font>

885
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:15,103
That was really fucking
        stupid.</font>

886
00:35:15,103 --> 00:35:18,890
All right, listen, Violet and
  I haven't necessarily been</font>

887
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,892
honest with you guys either,
  but we're willing to let</font>

888
00:35:20,892 --> 00:35:22,694
bygones be bygones, all right?</font>

889
00:35:22,694 --> 00:35:23,228
-OK.</font>

890
00:35:23,778 --> 00:35:24,779
Bygones are bygones.</font>

891
00:35:24,779 --> 00:35:26,898
We did not try to rob you.</font>

892
00:35:26,898 --> 00:35:28,450
I didn't just hold a knife
     to your throat.</font>

893
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:29,483
-I know, Vince.</font>

894
00:35:29,484 --> 00:35:31,536
I just said fucking rewind.</font>

895
00:35:31,903 --> 00:35:32,904
That doesn't exist.</font>

896
00:35:32,904 --> 00:35:33,822
The past-- shut the fuck up.</font>

897
00:35:33,821 --> 00:35:35,072
The past is the past,
      all right?</font>

898
00:35:35,073 --> 00:35:36,658
We're in the present.</font>

899
00:35:36,658 --> 00:35:37,626
Didn't exist.</font>

900
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:39,377
Let's start over.</font>

901
00:35:39,377 --> 00:35:40,879
Let's reset.</font>

902
00:35:40,878 --> 00:35:42,380
I'm cool with it.</font>

903
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,666
Are you cool with it?</font>

904
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:46,084
OK.</font>

905
00:35:46,084 --> 00:35:47,168
Guys, all right,
 so we're cool.</font>

906
00:35:47,669 --> 00:35:48,670
-We're cool.</font>

907
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,055
-Let's push play.</font>

908
00:35:50,054 --> 00:35:51,422
-You're not gonna call
   the cops on us?</font>

909
00:35:51,422 --> 00:35:53,224
-I'm not gonna call the
  fucking cops, cross</font>

910
00:35:53,224 --> 00:35:54,258
my heart, all right?</font>

911
00:35:54,759 --> 00:35:59,147
-So-- what-- what the
  fuck is this, huh?</font>

912
00:35:59,147 --> 00:36:00,148
What the fuck is this?</font>

913
00:36:00,598 --> 00:36:02,483
-This is Violet's
 birthday, guys.</font>

914
00:36:02,483 --> 00:36:03,517
What am I gonna get this girl?</font>

915
00:36:03,518 --> 00:36:05,403
Look at her, she's a vision.</font>

916
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:06,771
My God.</font>

917
00:36:06,771 --> 00:36:07,772
That girl's got everything.</font>

918
00:36:07,772 --> 00:36:09,240
She can but everything
      she wants.</font>

919
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,158
You gotta think outside
     the box, guys.</font>

920
00:36:10,158 --> 00:36:13,194
So Violet and I came
 up with this idea</font>

921
00:36:13,194 --> 00:36:14,696
for an awesome night.</font>

922
00:36:14,696 --> 00:36:16,665
-You gonna find a couple of
losers, you pay them a bunch</font>

923
00:36:16,664 --> 00:36:20,168
of money, and you laugh your
asses off while they humiliate</font>

924
00:36:20,168 --> 00:36:21,119
themselves.</font>

925
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:21,670
Awesome fucking night.</font>

926
00:36:21,669 --> 00:36:22,170
Happy birthday.</font>

927
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,087
-Stop.</font>

928
00:36:23,087 --> 00:36:23,421
Come on.</font>

929
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:24,455
Are you kidding me?</font>

930
00:36:24,872 --> 00:36:25,373
You guys aren't losers.</font>

931
00:36:25,373 --> 00:36:26,457
You're fucking awesome.</font>

932
00:36:26,457 --> 00:36:27,541
This has been a night, right?</font>

933
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:29,044
This has been fucking amazing.</font>

934
00:36:29,043 --> 00:36:32,930
This is more-- this is more
 like a reality game show.</font>

935
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:35,015
-What reality game show?</font>

936
00:36:35,016 --> 00:36:37,719
-You know, the game shows
    when they gobble,</font>

937
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:39,721
like, animal dicks.</font>

938
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:41,223
They make them do that.</font>

939
00:36:41,222 --> 00:36:42,807
Or put their head in a bucket
  of snakes or eat bugs, you</font>

940
00:36:42,807 --> 00:36:43,891
know, shit like that.</font>

941
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:45,809
Except this isn't TV.</font>

942
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,061
Right?</font>

943
00:36:47,061 --> 00:36:50,615
That and there's 250,000
   tax-free dollars.</font>

944
00:36:53,451 --> 00:36:54,452
-$250,000?</font>

945
00:36:54,452 --> 00:36:55,903
-What?</font>

946
00:36:57,455 --> 00:36:59,374
This money's for us?</font>

947
00:36:59,373 --> 00:37:01,408
-Yeah, down.</font>

948
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:02,961
-Fucking down.</font>

949
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,461

00:37:03,961 --> 00:37:04,295
I'm down, Colin.</font>

951
00:37:04,545 --> 00:37:05,129
I'm down.</font>

952
00:37:05,129 --> 00:37:05,630
-Fucking stay down, Vince.</font>

953
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,131
-OK.</font>

954
00:37:06,581 --> 00:37:07,632
OK.</font>

955
00:37:08,132 --> 00:37:10,001
-It's cool, bro.</font>

956
00:37:10,001 --> 00:37:11,419
It's cool.</font>

957
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:14,922

00:37:14,922 --> 00:37:16,257
That's-- you know.</font>

959
00:37:19,343 --> 00:37:21,345
You know what's funny?</font>

960
00:37:21,846 --> 00:37:24,515
This money that was in the safe
   was for the fucking game.</font>

961
00:37:24,982 --> 00:37:29,019
And we were gonna give it to
 you, and you guys took it.</font>

962
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,522
You know what that's like?</font>

963
00:37:30,521 --> 00:37:32,023
Um--</font>

964
00:37:32,023 --> 00:37:33,408
there's a word for it.</font>

00:37:33,991 --> 00:37:34,492

-Thank you.</font>

Super irony is what it is.</font>

-Call the cops on you?</font>

00:37:48,956 --> 00:37:51,926
No, I'm not gonna call the
   fucking cops on you.</font>

-And we can leave whenever
       we want to?</font>

00:37:53,961 --> 00:37:55,629
-I'd be bummed.</font>

00:37:57,548 --> 00:37:59,133
I really would.</font>

-OK.</font>

982
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:30,381
But let me tell you this, no
 matter how much money's in</font>

983
00:38:30,381 --> 00:38:32,383
that box, I am not
sucking his dick.</font>

no dudes boning dudes or
  blowing each other.</font>

No.</font>

You just have to do
  whatever we say.</font>

988
00:38:40,808 --> 00:38:41,809
Not that.</font>

How about this.</font>

00:38:55,573 --> 00:38:57,658
$500 to whoever can hold their
     breath the longest.</font>

00:40:21,993 --> 00:40:22,494
He did it.</font>

1047
00:40:22,493 --> 00:40:23,577
-$200?</font>

1048
00:40:24,161 --> 00:40:24,945
What?</font>

1049
00:40:24,946 --> 00:40:25,864
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, yeah.</font>

1050
00:40:25,863 --> 00:40:26,947
-All right, my turn now?</font>

1051
00:40:26,948 --> 00:40:27,615
-Your turn, Craig.</font>

1052
00:40:27,615 --> 00:40:29,867
Are you ready?</font>

1053
00:40:29,867 --> 00:40:31,252
-Yeah.</font>

1054
00:40:31,252 --> 00:40:35,873
-Three, two, one, go.</font>

1055
00:40:35,873 --> 00:40:36,841
-That's--</font>

1056
00:40:36,841 --> 00:40:37,508
that's not fair.</font>

1057
00:40:37,508 --> 00:40:38,092
-What's not fair?</font>

1058
00:40:38,592 --> 00:40:39,593
-You give--</font>

1059
00:40:40,094 --> 00:40:42,597
-I get to decide.</font>

1060
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:44,599
-All right, how much-- how
  much time did I have?</font>

1061
00:40:44,598 --> 00:40:47,101
-You were one minute,
     58 seconds.</font>

1062
00:40:47,101 --> 00:40:48,603
-OK.</font>

1063
00:40:52,723 --> 00:40:53,224
-Oh.</font>

1064
00:40:53,724 --> 00:40:54,225
-How you doing, buddy?</font>

1065
00:40:54,225 --> 00:40:54,726
Huh?</font>

1066
00:40:54,725 --> 00:40:56,644
You all right?</font>

1067
00:40:56,644 --> 00:40:58,062
You know, it actually
   really starts to</font>

1068
00:40:58,062 --> 00:40:59,480
hurt after one minute.</font>

1069
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:03,067
No, you know what?</font>

1070
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:04,535
I think he's about to blow.</font>

1071
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:07,455
-He actually looks better than
    you did at that point.</font>

1072
00:41:07,955 --> 00:41:11,459
-Yeah, I think he's got
    this in the bag.</font>

1073
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:14,962
I saw this documentary where
guys that dive for lobsters</font>

1074
00:41:14,962 --> 00:41:16,497
can go, like, five minutes.</font>

1075
00:41:16,497 --> 00:41:17,415
-What?</font>

1076
00:41:17,415 --> 00:41:19,801
Huh, that doesn't help?</font>

1077
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,718
What?</font>

1078
00:41:20,718 --> 00:41:23,921
What, it's just a little poke.</font>

1079
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:26,974
What, huh?</font>

1080
00:41:26,974 --> 00:41:28,008
-Oh, shit, bitch.</font>

1081
00:41:28,009 --> 00:41:30,979
He's going to reach you.</font>

1082
00:41:30,978 --> 00:41:37,017
53, 54, 55--</font>

1083
00:41:41,489 --> 00:41:43,358
oh shit!</font>

1084
00:41:43,357 --> 00:41:44,408
-Ha, ha, ha!</font>

1085
00:41:44,408 --> 00:41:45,359
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Oh!</font>

1086
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,827
-Fuck, Vince.</font>

1087
00:41:46,827 --> 00:41:47,411
-Pay up.</font>

1088
00:41:47,411 --> 00:41:49,413
-That got hairy.</font>

1089
00:41:49,413 --> 00:41:51,498
-You serious?</font>

1090
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:52,416
You pay him?</font>

1091
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:53,450
He just cheated.</font>

1092
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:55,119
-I didn't set any rules.</font>

1093
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:55,786
-Relax, man.</font>

1094
00:41:55,786 --> 00:41:56,837
We're just having fun.</font>

1095
00:41:59,507 --> 00:42:00,508
-What's next?</font>

1096
00:42:00,508 --> 00:42:02,844
-Oh, I like that.</font>

1097
00:42:02,843 --> 00:42:05,846
Let's go back out
 front, shall we?</font>

1098
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:12,636
This-a-way.</font>

1099
00:42:12,636 --> 00:42:14,555
Let's go this way.</font>

1100
00:42:23,314 --> 00:42:25,316
Look at that.</font>

1101
00:42:25,316 --> 00:42:27,318
You see that shit?</font>

1102
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:28,202
-That's shit.</font>

1103
00:42:28,702 --> 00:42:29,570
-Yes, that's what I said.</font>

1104
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:30,654
That shit.</font>

1105
00:42:30,654 --> 00:42:31,905
-Wait, you-- you want us to--</font>

1106
00:42:31,906 --> 00:42:32,323
-No.</font>

1107
00:42:32,323 --> 00:42:32,657
Eat it?</font>

1108
00:42:32,656 --> 00:42:33,240
No.</font>

1109
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,241
No, no.</font>

1110
00:42:34,241 --> 00:42:35,209
I want you to see that
     shit because</font>

1111
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:36,043
it's part of the story.</font>

1112
00:42:36,627 --> 00:42:38,078
You see that house over there?</font>

1113
00:42:38,496 --> 00:42:40,465
-Yeah.</font>

1114
00:42:40,464 --> 00:42:41,966
-Those assholes always
  let their dog take</font>

1115
00:42:42,466 --> 00:42:43,417
a shit on my lawn.</font>

1116
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:45,419
The other day I came out here
   to talk to the gardener.</font>

1117
00:42:45,419 --> 00:42:48,756
I stepped in a pile of shit,
wearing a brand new pair of</font>

1118
00:42:48,756 --> 00:42:49,674
suede oxfords.</font>

1119
00:42:49,673 --> 00:42:50,257
I was so fucking pissed.</font>

1120
00:42:50,758 --> 00:42:51,759
They were ruined.</font>

1121
00:42:55,312 --> 00:42:56,814
-OK, so?</font>

1122
00:42:56,814 --> 00:43:00,017
-So I want revenge
on the neighbors.</font>

1123
00:43:00,017 --> 00:43:04,438
$800 to whoever can sit
  inside their house.</font>

1124
00:43:04,772 --> 00:43:06,941
Photographic evidence
      required.</font>

1125
00:43:06,941 --> 00:43:07,942
-That's crazy.</font>

1126
00:43:07,942 --> 00:43:09,193
-All right, $1,200.</font>

1127
00:43:09,193 --> 00:43:11,078
That's my final offer.</font>

1128
00:43:11,078 --> 00:43:12,913
-Sure.</font>

1129
00:43:13,414 --> 00:43:14,916
-I'm in.</font>

1130
00:43:14,915 --> 00:43:16,583
-I like it.</font>

1131
00:43:16,584 --> 00:43:17,668
Misfit.</font>

1132
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:29,931
-Craig, you-- you--</font>

1133
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:32,382
you really don't want
 to do this, do you?</font>

1134
00:43:32,383 --> 00:43:34,385
-No, I don't want to take a shit
    in this person's house,</font>

1135
00:43:34,385 --> 00:43:35,353
but I need the money.</font>

1136
00:43:35,352 --> 00:43:36,887
My family needs the money.</font>

1137
00:43:36,887 --> 00:43:38,889
-You know, this-- this-- this
  is breaking and entering.</font>

1138
00:43:38,889 --> 00:43:41,392
That's minimum two-year
sentence, just so you know.</font>

1139
00:43:41,392 --> 00:43:42,894
-Hey, dummy.</font>

1140
00:43:42,893 --> 00:43:44,895
We just held them at knifepoint,
        and this feels a</font>

1141
00:43:45,362 --> 00:43:46,363
million times safer.</font>

1142
00:43:46,363 --> 00:43:48,899
You're not backing
  out, are you?</font>

1143
00:43:48,899 --> 00:43:49,400
-No.</font>

1144
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,401
No, no.</font>

1145
00:43:50,401 --> 00:43:52,403
I'm not backing out.</font>

1146
00:43:52,403 --> 00:43:54,405
Thanks to you and your shitty
back up and the fact that you</font>

1147
00:43:54,405 --> 00:43:57,408
never searched Violet, this
 stupid fucking game is the</font>

1148
00:43:57,408 --> 00:43:58,409
only way I'm getting
 out of this house</font>

1149
00:43:58,409 --> 00:43:59,410
with any real money.</font>

1150
00:43:59,877 --> 00:44:00,828
So no, I'm not backing out.</font>

1151
00:44:01,328 --> 00:44:02,329
-Just hold the girl.</font>

1152
00:44:02,746 --> 00:44:04,331
I'll take care of the rest.</font>

1153
00:44:04,331 --> 00:44:06,333
I remember that being your
 sole instruction to me.</font>

1154
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:08,252
-I've been arrested
    before, OK?</font>

1155
00:44:08,752 --> 00:44:10,254
I've been through the system.</font>

1156
00:44:10,254 --> 00:44:11,255
I know I can handle it.</font>

1157
00:44:11,755 --> 00:44:12,756
You, on the other hand?</font>

1158
00:44:12,756 --> 00:44:14,258
That's all I'm saying.</font>

1159
00:45:34,922 --> 00:45:35,923
-Good luck, man.</font>

1160
00:45:57,695 --> 00:45:59,080
[siren]</font>

1161
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:03,918
-You son of a--</font>

1162
00:46:11,175 --> 00:46:12,677
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): You
  gotta-- you gotta</font>

1163
00:46:13,177 --> 00:46:14,679
start writing lyrics.</font>

1164
00:46:14,678 --> 00:46:16,180
You really have to.</font>

1165
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,131
OK, then just start journaling
 and then later turn it into</font>

1166
00:46:18,682 --> 00:46:21,185
something, you know
  what I'm saying?</font>

1167
00:46:25,105 --> 00:46:26,690
Hey, there he is.</font>

1168
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:27,641
Yo, you got something for me?</font>

1169
00:46:31,195 --> 00:46:33,481
Oh, no.</font>

1170
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,065
Oh no, really?</font>

1171
00:46:35,065 --> 00:46:35,899
Oh my god.</font>

1172
00:46:35,899 --> 00:46:36,950
Look at-- you did it.</font>

1173
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:37,901
I can't-- baby, you
 want to see this?</font>

1174
00:46:37,901 --> 00:46:39,903
-I'm good.</font>

1175
00:46:39,903 --> 00:46:42,122
COLIN (OFFSCREEN):
  What is that?</font>

1176
00:46:42,573 --> 00:46:43,657
What is that?</font>

1177
00:46:43,657 --> 00:46:45,125
-All right, you know what?</font>

1178
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:47,744
So Craig, yeah, he took a shit
  in your neighbor's house.</font>

1179
00:46:47,745 --> 00:46:48,713
Big fucking deal.</font>

1180
00:46:49,246 --> 00:46:50,714
This little fucker's still
 gonna crap in your yard.</font>

1181
00:46:50,714 --> 00:46:53,750
How about I take care of
   the actual problem</font>

1182
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:56,837
permanently, huh?</font>

1183
00:46:56,837 --> 00:46:58,756
How much for that?</font>

1184
00:46:58,756 --> 00:47:00,258
Five, $6,000?</font>

1185
00:47:00,758 --> 00:47:03,844
-Uh, how about, uh, nothing?</font>

1186
00:47:03,844 --> 00:47:06,347
Does that figure suit you OK?</font>

1187
00:47:06,847 --> 00:47:07,931
-What?</font>

1188
00:47:07,931 --> 00:47:10,016
-I'm not gonna pay you to
   kill a helpless dog.</font>

1189
00:47:10,434 --> 00:47:11,402
-Yeah, but--</font>

1190
00:47:11,402 --> 00:47:12,937
-What kind of sick birthday
   present would that be?</font>

1191
00:47:13,487 --> 00:47:15,155
It's er birthday, Vince.</font>

1192
00:47:15,155 --> 00:47:16,323
-So I--</font>

1193
00:47:16,907 --> 00:47:18,609
I just did all of that
  for-- for nothing?</font>

1194
00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:19,660
VIOLET (OFFSCREEN): Oh, cutie.</font>

1195
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:22,163
Oh, you are cute, aren't you?</font>

1196
00:47:24,365 --> 00:47:26,367
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): That was
really not fucking cool, what</font>

1197
00:47:26,367 --> 00:47:27,869
you just did, man.</font>

1198
00:47:27,868 --> 00:47:29,370
You could have really fucked
     me up over there.</font>

1199
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:30,454
CRAIG (OFFSCREEN): You fucking
  punched me in the stomach</font>

1200
00:47:30,454 --> 00:47:31,505
before, man.</font>

1201
00:47:32,005 --> 00:47:33,006
You fucking pissed
 on me out there.</font>

1202
00:47:33,006 --> 00:47:34,007
-That is not the same thing.</font>

1203
00:47:34,007 --> 00:47:34,508
-How is that not
the same thing?</font>

1204
00:47:35,008 --> 00:47:35,926
Think about it.</font>

1205
00:47:35,926 --> 00:47:37,511
-Get your fucking finger
  out of my face, man.</font>

1206
00:47:45,602 --> 00:47:47,104
-Come on, guys.</font>

1207
00:47:47,104 --> 00:47:48,022
Ease up.</font>

1208
00:47:48,021 --> 00:47:50,106
It's supposed to be
   a celebration.</font>

1209
00:47:50,107 --> 00:47:51,558
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): What are
    we doing next, huh?</font>

1210
00:47:51,558 --> 00:47:53,060
-Keeping it moving,
    I like that.</font>

1211
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,061
How about--</font>

1212
00:47:54,061 --> 00:47:55,029
-Where's my money?</font>

1213
00:47:55,028 --> 00:47:56,980
-Oh, shit.</font>

1214
00:47:57,448 --> 00:47:58,532
My bad.</font>

1215
00:48:04,571 --> 00:48:10,577
100, 200, 300--</font>

1216
00:48:10,577 --> 00:48:12,079
-I think we all know
   how this ends.</font>

1217
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,081
Can we just fast forward
   this part, please?</font>

1218
00:48:22,089 --> 00:48:24,592
-As promised.</font>

1219
00:48:25,092 --> 00:48:26,093
-What are we doing next, huh?</font>

1220
00:48:31,098 --> 00:48:32,600
-I got it.</font>

1221
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:37,604
$300 to whoever can make
me a vodka tonic first.</font>

1222
00:48:38,105 --> 00:48:39,106
Three, two, one, go.</font>

1223
00:48:45,496 --> 00:48:47,999
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): One vodka
tonic coming right up, sir.</font>

1224
00:48:47,998 --> 00:48:50,501
Hey, uh, could you toss me one
   of those limes, brother?</font>

1225
00:48:53,837 --> 00:48:55,172
All right.</font>

1226
00:49:04,348 --> 00:49:05,349
-You OK?</font>

1227
00:49:11,855 --> 00:49:12,856
You're really tense.</font>

1228
00:49:18,612 --> 00:49:20,614
All coiled up.</font>

1229
00:49:20,614 --> 00:49:22,116
So many knots.</font>

1230
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:28,122
I think you'd feel better
 if you let me fuck you.</font>

1231
00:49:32,576 --> 00:49:33,877
-What?</font>

1232
00:49:33,877 --> 00:49:35,879
What did she just say?</font>

1233
00:49:35,879 --> 00:49:37,330
-Still waiting on that
    drink, Vince.</font>

1234
00:49:41,168 --> 00:49:44,254
-Would you like that, Craig?</font>

1235
00:49:44,755 --> 00:49:46,257
Would you like to fuck me?</font>

1236
00:49:46,757 --> 00:49:48,642
-Are you hearing
this right now?</font>

1237
00:49:48,642 --> 00:49:50,144
-Yeah, I am.</font>

1238
00:49:52,563 --> 00:49:53,514
What's the matter, Craig?</font>

1239
00:49:54,014 --> 00:49:55,766
Why don't you want
 to fuck my wife?</font>

1240
00:50:01,522 --> 00:50:02,523
She's hot, isn't she?</font>

1241
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,408
Don't you want to fuck her?</font>

1242
00:50:04,408 --> 00:50:07,411
-You don't care?</font>

1243
00:50:07,411 --> 00:50:08,862
-Why would I?</font>

1244
00:50:08,862 --> 00:50:10,330
-It's cool.</font>

1245
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:11,865
We have an open relationship.</font>

1246
00:50:11,865 --> 00:50:13,367
-Yeah, that's--</font>

1247
00:50:13,367 --> 00:50:15,452
great, but my wife and I don't.</font>

1248
00:50:15,953 --> 00:50:16,454
So--</font>

1249
00:50:16,954 --> 00:50:17,455
-Hey, um, I--</font>

1250
00:50:17,454 --> 00:50:18,839
I'd fuck you, Violet.</font>

1251
00:50:22,626 --> 00:50:25,262
-Please, Craig?</font>

1252
00:50:25,762 --> 00:50:26,796
I really want to.</font>

1253
00:50:26,797 --> 00:50:30,301
-Look, uh, you're a lovely,
      you know, woman.</font>

1254
00:50:30,801 --> 00:50:31,635
I'm flattered, really.</font>

1255
00:50:31,635 --> 00:50:32,553
But I--</font>

1256
00:50:32,553 --> 00:50:33,554
I just can't do that.</font>

1257
00:50:33,554 --> 00:50:34,722
-Come on, Craig.</font>

1258
00:50:34,721 --> 00:50:35,305
It's her birthday.</font>

1259
00:50:35,689 --> 00:50:37,057
-Guys, I'm married.</font>

1260
00:50:37,057 --> 00:50:38,058
It's not going to happen.</font>

1261
00:50:38,058 --> 00:50:42,029
-Well, how about if I paid
     you to fuck her?</font>

1262
00:50:42,029 --> 00:50:44,448
Would it be cool then?</font>

1263
00:50:45,032 --> 00:50:46,033
-Paid me?</font>

1264
00:50:46,033 --> 00:50:48,035
-Yeah, how about, uh, $2,000?</font>

1265
00:50:48,535 --> 00:50:50,454
-This is some weird-ass
       shit, man.</font>

1266
00:50:56,076 --> 00:50:57,077
-I can't believe I'm
    saying this.</font>

1267
00:50:57,544 --> 00:50:58,829
Uh--</font>

1268
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:00,831
how about 4,500?</font>

1269
00:51:01,298 --> 00:51:03,717
How does that number sound?</font>

1270
00:51:03,717 --> 00:51:05,219
When I put the money in the
   wallet for-- for-- for</font>

1271
00:51:05,218 --> 00:51:09,222
punching that dude, I saw
   the eviction notice.</font>

1272
00:51:09,723 --> 00:51:12,142
Sorry for reading it,
  but shit, I mean,</font>

1273
00:51:12,726 --> 00:51:14,011
it was right there.</font>

1274
00:51:14,011 --> 00:51:16,480
-Oh my god.</font>

1275
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,598
-Please, Craig.</font>

1276
00:51:34,665 --> 00:51:36,700
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): Obviously
  the guy doesn't want to.</font>

1277
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,584
OK?</font>

1278
00:51:37,584 --> 00:51:39,086
I mean, cut-- cut--
  cut him a break.</font>

1279
00:51:39,086 --> 00:51:40,087
I'll fuck her for free, man.</font>

1280
00:51:40,087 --> 00:51:41,589
-Cool it, Vince.</font>

1281
00:51:41,588 --> 00:51:42,589
It's not gonna happen.</font>

1282
00:51:42,589 --> 00:51:43,090
She's into married dudes.</font>

1283
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:44,592
What can I say?</font>

1284
00:51:44,591 --> 00:51:45,792
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): That's
  some fucking bullshit.</font>

1285
00:51:51,848 --> 00:51:54,351
-$4,500?</font>

1286
00:51:54,351 --> 00:51:55,352
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): All that.</font>

1287
00:51:58,355 --> 00:51:59,356
-I love my wife.</font>

1288
00:51:59,773 --> 00:52:02,609
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Why don't
     you prove it, man?</font>

1289
00:52:02,609 --> 00:52:05,529
Show her.</font>

1290
00:52:05,529 --> 00:52:06,947
Get your family off
    the street.</font>

1291
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:11,285
Pay your rent, Craig.</font>

1292
00:52:21,578 --> 00:52:23,413
Oh, that shit's hot.</font>

1293
00:53:04,588 --> 00:53:06,790
-I'm gonna fucking come.</font>

1294
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:08,875
-I'm coming too, baby.</font>

1295

Oh--</font>

-What the fuck?</font>

1303
00:53:41,792 --> 00:53:42,793
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): -Ah, shit.</font>

1304
00:53:42,793 --> 00:53:43,794
Oh fuck, baby.</font>

1305
00:54:00,927 --> 00:54:02,429
Well fuck, man.</font>

1306
00:54:02,429 --> 00:54:04,481
Things get a little sticky
       there, boys.</font>

1307
00:54:04,481 --> 00:54:08,769
I might, uh, have to go
downstairs and make a quick</font>

1308
00:54:08,769 --> 00:54:11,655
wardrobe change.</font>

1309
00:54:11,655 --> 00:54:12,656
Hoo.</font>

1310
00:54:14,658 --> 00:54:15,659
Ahh.</font>

1311
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:18,945
We'll keep the game going.</font>

1312
00:54:19,246 --> 00:54:20,330
Back in a flash, boys.</font>

1313
00:54:32,876 --> 00:54:35,379
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): You
did not deserve that.</font>

1314
00:54:35,378 --> 00:54:37,380
Not one bit.</font>

-What do you mean done?</font>

1318
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:53,397
-I'm going home.</font>

1319
00:54:53,396 --> 00:54:54,397
-Good.</font>

1320
00:54:54,397 --> 00:54:55,899
Glad to see you go.</font>

00:55:14,918 --> 00:55:17,888
-See you in five years,
      huh, buddy?</font>

1323
00:55:17,888 --> 00:55:19,390
Don't forget to write.</font>

-All right, bitches.</font>

1325
00:55:43,864 --> 00:55:45,366
You ready to make
 some real money?</font>

1326
00:55:45,365 --> 00:55:46,366
-Oh, yeah.</font>

1327
00:55:46,366 --> 00:55:47,367
That's what I'm talking about.</font>

Where's Craig?</font>

-Oh, no.</font>

1332
00:55:50,704 --> 00:55:52,289
He peaced.</font>

1333
00:55:52,289 --> 00:55:53,791
Yeah.</font>

1334
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:54,874
No, I think cheating on his wife
    really freaked him out.</font>

1335
00:55:58,211 --> 00:55:59,796
Where's she going?</font>

-Well--</font>

1338
00:56:49,012 --> 00:56:51,097
well, what's the problem, huh?</font>

1339
00:56:51,097 --> 00:56:54,183
I mean, I'm still here, right?</font>

00:57:00,523 --> 00:57:04,193
I'm feeling a little unloved

You're boss, bro.</font>

1346
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:10,951
It's just that we-- we-- we
 hate breaking up the crew.</font>

 the crew since fucking high</font>

1348
00:57:12,953 --> 00:57:14,955
school, all right?</font>

Come on, let's keep
  this going, huh?</font>

What do you want
 me to do next?</font>

1351
00:57:21,428 --> 00:57:22,429
Huh?</font>

-Follow me.</font>

1353
00:57:39,946 --> 00:57:41,448
Cut your pinkie off.</font>

1354

It's your pinkie.</font>

You use it for, like, nothing.</font>

1360

1362

-How much?</font>

1363
00:58:07,674 --> 00:58:09,176
Yeah.</font>

1364
00:58:09,676 --> 00:58:11,678
How much, he wants to know.</font>

1365
00:58:16,149 --> 00:58:18,852
Let's think about it.</font>

1366
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:20,353
Let's say--</font>

1367
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:34,167
$25,000.</font>

1368

OK, I'll do it.</font>

00:58:56,106 --> 00:58:56,523
OK.</font>

1376
00:58:57,974 --> 00:58:59,025
-Awesome.</font>

1377

What are you, like, a ninja?</font>

1384
00:59:16,409 --> 00:59:20,330
-I'll cut my pinkie
  off for $23,000.</font>

1385
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:22,132
-What the fuck is wrong
    with you, Craig?</font>

1386
00:59:22,132 --> 00:59:23,216
-You don't get it, do you?</font>

1387
00:59:23,216 --> 00:59:24,718
-No.</font>

1388
00:59:24,717 --> 00:59:25,718
Look, you've already got your
    rent money, all right?</font>

1389
00:59:25,718 --> 00:59:28,721
Let somebody else have a shot.</font>

1390
00:59:28,721 --> 00:59:31,724
-That 4,500 takes care of my
eviction problems, but only</font>

1391
00:59:31,724 --> 00:59:32,225
this month.</font>

1392
00:59:32,725 --> 00:59:33,726
What about next month?</font>

1393
00:59:33,726 --> 00:59:35,428
My wife and I are
 both unemployed.</font>

1394
00:59:35,428 --> 00:59:36,429
How do I pay my rent?</font>

1395
00:59:36,429 --> 00:59:37,730
How do I feed my kid?</font>

1396
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:40,516
23 grand gives me some--
  some breathing room.</font>

1397
00:59:41,017 --> 00:59:44,020
So if I gotta cut my pinkie
       off for that,</font>

1398
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,022
fuck it, I'll do it.</font>

1399
00:59:46,022 --> 00:59:47,524
-That's right, Craig.</font>

1400
00:59:48,024 --> 00:59:49,025
You gotta think about
     the future.</font>

1401
00:59:49,526 --> 00:59:49,943
-Yeah.</font>

1402
00:59:49,943 --> 00:59:50,827
No, no.</font>

1403
00:59:50,827 --> 00:59:52,779
But wait, wait-- what
    about me, huh?</font>

1404
00:59:52,779 --> 00:59:55,282
Every time I go to work,
    I'm this close--</font>

1405
00:59:55,832 --> 00:59:57,834
this fucking close to be
  thrown back in jail.</font>

1406
00:59:58,118 --> 00:59:58,869
And I don't make that
     much money.</font>

1407
00:59:59,452 --> 01:00:01,454
Not for what I fucking do.</font>

1408
01:00:01,454 --> 01:00:03,539
-Nobody told you to drop
  out of high school.</font>

1409
01:00:03,873 --> 01:00:06,209
You could have done anything
 you wanted, but you didn't</font>

1410
01:00:06,209 --> 01:00:07,210
want to work for it.</font>

1411
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:09,713
Your life is exactly
 what you made it.</font>

1412
01:00:12,348 --> 01:00:13,850
-Wow.</font>

1413
01:00:15,852 --> 01:00:16,686
Fuck you.</font>

1414
01:00:22,692 --> 01:00:26,229
I'll do it for 22.</font>

1415
01:00:26,529 --> 01:00:27,613
-21.</font>

1416
01:00:31,651 --> 01:00:33,153
-20.</font>

1417
01:00:33,153 --> 01:00:37,290
And if you say another fucking
 word, I will knock you out.</font>

1418
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:38,291
-19.</font>

1419
01:00:38,791 --> 01:00:42,244
-I said shut your
  fucking mouth.</font>

1420
01:00:42,245 --> 01:00:43,747
18.</font>

1421
01:00:53,473 --> 01:00:53,890
-All right.</font>

1422
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:56,676
-$15,000.</font>

1423
01:00:56,676 --> 01:00:59,596
-Are you fucking crazy, man?</font>

1424
01:00:59,596 --> 01:01:02,099
You're gonna cut off your
   pinkie for $15,000?</font>

1425
01:01:02,098 --> 01:01:03,600
That's a finger.</font>

1426
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,851
-It's not like it's
   gone forever.</font>

1427
01:01:05,351 --> 01:01:09,355
Even if costs me six grand to
 sew it back on, that's still</font>

1428
01:01:09,355 --> 01:01:10,823
9,000 more dollars than when
  I woke up this morning.</font>

1429
01:01:11,357 --> 01:01:11,858
-All right.</font>

1430
01:01:11,858 --> 01:01:12,776
Fine, man.</font>

1431
01:01:12,775 --> 01:01:14,360
If you want to mutilate
      yourself for</font>

1432
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,363
$15,000, go right ahead.</font>

1433
01:01:17,363 --> 01:01:18,865
-All right.</font>

1434
01:01:18,865 --> 01:01:20,367
Let's, uh--</font>

1435
01:01:20,867 --> 01:01:23,336
let's get it ready.</font>

1436
01:01:23,336 --> 01:01:24,370
Uh, OK.</font>

1437
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:25,371
This one, right?</font>

1438
01:01:25,371 --> 01:01:26,372
-Oh, wait.</font>

1439
01:01:26,372 --> 01:01:27,373
Could we do-- because
     I use that--</font>

1440
01:01:27,373 --> 01:01:27,874
-Sure.</font>

1441
01:01:27,874 --> 01:01:28,375
Yeah.</font>

1442
01:01:28,374 --> 01:01:29,375
Your choice.</font>

1443
01:01:29,375 --> 01:01:29,876
-Thank you.</font>

1444
01:01:30,376 --> 01:01:30,877
That's nice of you.</font>

1445
01:01:30,877 --> 01:01:31,378
-There you go.</font>

1446
01:01:31,878 --> 01:01:32,379
Care to do the honors?</font>

1447
01:01:32,378 --> 01:01:33,379
-It would be my pleasure.</font>

1448
01:01:33,379 --> 01:01:34,380
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.</font>

1449
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:35,381
You--</font>

1450
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:36,382
you don't want to
  do it, Colin?</font>

1451
01:01:36,382 --> 01:01:37,216
-Sorry, dude.</font>

1452
01:01:37,217 --> 01:01:38,769
Too gross.</font>

1453
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,022
-Let's put that right there.</font>

1454
01:01:42,021 --> 01:01:43,022
OK?</font>

1455
01:01:43,022 --> 01:01:44,023
I'm going to count to three.</font>

1456
01:01:44,524 --> 01:01:45,025
One--</font>

1457
01:01:45,024 --> 01:01:46,025
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.</font>

1458
01:01:46,025 --> 01:01:46,526
Jesus Christ.</font>

1459
01:01:46,526 --> 01:01:47,027
Hold on.</font>

1460
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:51,448
OK, I'm ready.</font>

1461
01:01:51,447 --> 01:01:52,365
Are you ready?</font>

1462
01:01:52,365 --> 01:01:52,899
-One.</font>

1463
01:01:52,899 --> 01:01:53,900
-No, no, no.</font>

1464
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:54,867
Not yet.</font>

1465
01:01:54,867 --> 01:01:55,901
Just are you ready?</font>

1466
01:01:55,902 --> 01:01:58,238
-Yes, I'm ready.</font>

1467
01:01:58,238 --> 01:02:00,824
Are you ready?</font>

1468
01:02:00,823 --> 01:02:02,792
-Are you sure you don't want
 to do this instead of him?</font>

1469
01:02:03,326 --> 01:02:05,328
-Sorry, bro.</font>

1470
01:02:05,328 --> 01:02:06,329
-OK.</font>

1471
01:02:06,329 --> 01:02:09,833
OK, OK, OK.</font>

1472
01:02:09,832 --> 01:02:10,333
Go.</font>

1473
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:11,334
-One--</font>

1474
01:02:11,334 --> 01:02:11,751
-Wait.</font>

1475
01:02:11,751 --> 01:02:12,835
-What?</font>

1476
01:02:12,835 --> 01:02:15,338
-I gotta check to make
 sure the iron's hot.</font>

1477
01:02:15,338 --> 01:02:15,839
OK.</font>

1478
01:02:16,339 --> 01:02:16,806
I--</font>

1479
01:02:16,806 --> 01:02:17,757
I don't want blood everywhere.</font>

1480
01:02:17,757 --> 01:02:18,758
CRAIG (OFFSCREEN):
  Jesus Christ.</font>

1481
01:02:19,342 --> 01:02:19,843
-We're good to go.</font>

1482
01:02:19,842 --> 01:02:20,843
-OK.</font>

1483
01:02:20,843 --> 01:02:23,346
For real this time, all right?</font>

1484
01:02:23,346 --> 01:02:25,315
-Oh yeah.</font>

1485
01:02:25,315 --> 01:02:27,267
-Do it, Vince.</font>

1486
01:02:27,267 --> 01:02:28,401
-One, two, three.</font>

1487
01:02:28,401 --> 01:02:29,352
-Oh shit, bro.</font>

1488
01:02:29,686 --> 01:02:32,072
You can't puss out on us now.</font>

1489
01:02:32,071 --> 01:02:33,439
-I need something
  for the pain.</font>

1490
01:02:33,439 --> 01:02:34,273
-What are you talking about?</font>

1491
01:02:34,274 --> 01:02:34,858
He hasn't even done it yet.</font>

1492
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:36,276
-No, no.</font>

1493
01:02:36,276 --> 01:02:37,944
Something to take away the pain,
     to numb it, to keep me</font>

1494
01:02:37,944 --> 01:02:39,446
from feeling anything
 in the first place.</font>

1495
01:02:39,445 --> 01:02:40,696
-Oh, uh--</font>

1496
01:02:40,697 --> 01:02:42,082
you still got those
 pills I gave you?</font>

1497
01:02:42,081 --> 01:02:43,199
-Yeah, one of them.</font>

1498
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,167
Somewhere.</font>

1499
01:02:44,167 --> 01:02:45,335
-Well, give it to me.</font>

1500
01:02:45,335 --> 01:02:46,286
I'll crush it up.</font>

1501
01:02:46,286 --> 01:02:47,287
You can rail it.</font>

1502
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:48,204
You won't feel a
 fucking thing.</font>

1503
01:02:48,204 --> 01:02:49,205
-It's in here somewhere.</font>

1504
01:02:49,205 --> 01:02:51,874
Hold on.</font>

1505
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:53,376
-There it is.</font>

1506
01:02:53,676 --> 01:02:54,427
It's done.</font>

1507
01:02:54,427 --> 01:02:56,429
And I hope it hurt.</font>

1508
01:02:56,429 --> 01:02:58,264
-Oh, shit.</font>

1509
01:02:58,264 --> 01:02:59,215
Fuck.</font>

1510
01:02:59,215 --> 01:03:00,216

Just let go of your arm.</font>

1514

-What are you waiting for?</font>

1523
01:03:31,881 --> 01:03:33,966
-It's still fucking attached.</font>

1524
01:03:33,966 --> 01:03:34,884
All the way off.</font>

1525
01:03:34,884 --> 01:03:36,803
That's the fucking deal, bro.</font>

You fucking did it.</font>

1538

How's it feel to be
  $15,000 richer?</font>

-Do me a favor.</font>

Let me see it.</font>

1541
01:04:35,812 --> 01:04:38,315

     it was again.</font>

[gagging]</font>

1557
01:05:25,111 --> 01:05:26,696
-Oh, I think I just heard it.</font>

1558
01:05:26,696 --> 01:05:28,164
-Good.</font>

1559
01:05:28,164 --> 01:05:30,116
I thought I was going
    fucking crazy.</font>

1560
01:05:30,116 --> 01:05:32,085
-No, I heard it that time.</font>

1561
01:05:32,084 --> 01:05:34,036
VIOLET (OFFSCREEN): I think it's
     coming from over here.</font>

1562
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:47,767
-Guys, do you know where
     my finger is?</font>

1563
01:05:47,767 --> 01:05:48,768
VIOLET (OFFSCREEN): Uh-oh.</font>

1564
01:05:48,768 --> 01:05:49,969
COLIN (OFFSCREEN):
  What's wrong?</font>

1565
01:05:49,969 --> 01:05:52,305
-Oh, the dog's dead.</font>

1566
01:05:52,305 --> 01:05:53,439
-What the fuck?</font>

1567
01:05:53,439 --> 01:05:54,523
What--</font>

1568
01:05:54,524 --> 01:05:56,026
how'd that happen?</font>

1569
01:05:59,529 --> 01:06:02,032
Oh, no.</font>

1570
01:06:02,532 --> 01:06:03,033
What the fuck?</font>

1571
01:06:03,449 --> 01:06:06,035
-Oh, it choked on
 Craig's finger.</font>

1572
01:06:12,959 --> 01:06:14,461
-All right, I'll take
    care of this.</font>

1573
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:15,711
Go check on him.</font>

1574
01:06:22,668 --> 01:06:24,170
-Fuck.</font>

1575
01:06:27,974 --> 01:06:29,476
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): That's
      fucking weird.</font>

1576
01:06:39,936 --> 01:06:44,824
-Good luck reattaching that
     crew toy now, huh?</font>

1577
01:06:44,824 --> 01:06:48,277
-You're a real piece of
  shit, you know that?</font>

1578
01:06:52,498 --> 01:06:53,582
-Yeah.</font>

1579
01:06:55,084 --> 01:06:58,955
At least I didn't steal $25,000
        from my friend.</font>

1580
01:06:58,955 --> 01:07:02,292
-I need that money
  for my family.</font>

1581
01:07:05,294 --> 01:07:08,881
You'd just blow it on
  hookers and drugs.</font>

1582
01:07:08,881 --> 01:07:10,466
I know you.</font>

1583
01:07:10,466 --> 01:07:11,968
-Yeah, I know you too, Craig.</font>

1584
01:07:11,968 --> 01:07:15,772
-I'm not that person anymore.</font>

1585
01:07:15,771 --> 01:07:17,856
I have responsibilities.</font>

1586
01:07:17,857 --> 01:07:19,359
I have a life to live.</font>

1587
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:24,363
You don't have shit to do but
  waste the world's oxygen.</font>

1588
01:07:24,363 --> 01:07:26,365
You're a fucking loser.</font>

1589
01:07:26,866 --> 01:07:30,486
You know that, Vince?</font>

1590
01:07:30,486 --> 01:07:30,870
-No.</font>

1591
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:32,955
Yeah, I do.</font>

1592
01:07:32,955 --> 01:07:34,457
I know I'm a loser.</font>

1593
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:39,963
See, I've always known that.</font>

1594
01:07:39,962 --> 01:07:43,299
But you, you really surprised
          me, Craig.</font>

1595
01:07:43,299 --> 01:07:46,302
You see, because you had
parents that loved you.</font>

1596
01:07:46,302 --> 01:07:49,138
And they took care of you.</font>

1597
01:07:49,138 --> 01:07:54,143
They sent you to college and
   got you an education.</font>

1598
01:07:54,143 --> 01:07:56,929
But look how you fucking
      turned out.</font>

1599
01:07:56,929 --> 01:07:58,931
I mean, you obviously didn't
    make it as a writer.</font>

1600
01:07:58,931 --> 01:08:01,817
I mean, hell, you can't even
keep a job changing oil at a</font>

1601
01:08:02,318 --> 01:08:03,319
fucking car shop.</font>

1602
01:08:05,321 --> 01:08:10,326
You had to fuck another woman
and mutilate yourself just to</font>

1603
01:08:10,326 --> 01:08:11,828
keep your family
off the street.</font>

1604
01:08:11,827 --> 01:08:12,828
So who's--</font>

1605
01:08:12,828 --> 01:08:15,331
who's the bigger loser?</font>

1606
01:08:15,331 --> 01:08:16,833
Huh?</font>

1607
01:08:25,091 --> 01:08:26,542
-Oh, you guys are still here.</font>

1608
01:08:26,542 --> 01:08:28,094
-Fuck, that smells good.</font>

1609
01:08:28,094 --> 01:08:28,595
-Doesn't it?</font>

1610
01:08:29,095 --> 01:08:29,596
-Yeah.</font>

1611
01:08:29,595 --> 01:08:30,096
-You hungry?</font>

1612
01:08:30,596 --> 01:08:31,097
-I could eat.</font>

1613
01:08:31,097 --> 01:08:32,599
-Then let's do it.</font>

1614
01:08:32,598 --> 01:08:34,049
Join me.</font>

1615
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:36,219
Let's gain sustenance,
      shall we?</font>

1616
01:08:38,721 --> 01:08:41,807
You know what, honey, that
bottle we've been saving.</font>

1617
01:08:46,028 --> 01:08:48,030
Ah--</font>

1618
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:51,650
this particular dish
 pairs well with a</font>

1619
01:08:51,651 --> 01:08:55,655
$10,000 bottle of tequila.</font>

1620
01:08:55,655 --> 01:08:58,158
Asuckamadee, Pancho Villa.</font>

1621
01:09:00,793 --> 01:09:04,330
-What the fuck?</font>

1622
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:05,832
What?</font>

1623
01:09:08,334 --> 01:09:09,802
-Oh, no.</font>

1624
01:09:09,802 --> 01:09:10,803
Oh, no.</font>

1625
01:09:11,303 --> 01:09:14,139
-Moments ago you were raving
      about the smell.</font>

1626
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:15,591
-Why-- why did you--</font>

1627
01:09:15,975 --> 01:09:17,009
-Make it?</font>

1628
01:09:17,009 --> 01:09:18,561
So you could eat
 it, obviously.</font>

1629
01:09:18,561 --> 01:09:21,564
-Yeah, but I thought you
 guys were dog people.</font>

1630
01:09:21,564 --> 01:09:22,565
-No, no.</font>

1631
01:09:22,565 --> 01:09:24,183
I just don't want to kill
    a helpless animal.</font>

1632
01:09:24,183 --> 01:09:26,235
But I mean, it's already
       dead, so--</font>

1633
01:09:26,235 --> 01:09:27,353
you're not vegetarians,
        are you?</font>

1634
01:09:27,903 --> 01:09:28,437
-Oh my god.</font>

1635
01:09:28,938 --> 01:09:29,939
I think I just became one.</font>

1636
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:32,442
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Tastes
  like chicken, really.</font>

1637
01:09:32,441 --> 01:09:33,442
-But it's not a chicken.</font>

1638
01:09:33,442 --> 01:09:34,443
It's a dog.</font>

1639
01:09:34,944 --> 01:09:36,028
-Don't be so limited, bro.</font>

1640
01:09:36,612 --> 01:09:38,614
I've seen dog on menus
throughout the world.</font>

1641
01:09:38,614 --> 01:09:39,832
You need to get out.</font>

1642
01:09:39,832 --> 01:09:41,917
-Is it even safe to eat?</font>

1643
01:09:41,917 --> 01:09:43,419
-Yes.</font>

1644
01:09:43,419 --> 01:09:45,838
Cooked all the way through,
internal temperature of 165.</font>

1645
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:48,374
I've got a meat thermometer.</font>

1646
01:09:48,374 --> 01:09:51,460
So what's the offer?</font>

1647
01:09:53,462 --> 01:10:01,770
$50,000 to whoever finishes
    their portion first.</font>

1648
01:10:01,771 --> 01:10:03,690
$50,000.</font>

1649
01:10:03,689 --> 01:10:07,226
That's probably more than you
 guys make in a year, right?</font>

1650
01:10:07,727 --> 01:10:08,561
Think about that.</font>

1651
01:10:09,145 --> 01:10:10,647
Takes away a lot of worry.</font>

1652
01:10:11,113 --> 01:10:12,231
Bills are paid.</font>

1653
01:10:12,815 --> 01:10:15,368
You have time to do
 things you wanted.</font>

1654
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:25,961
It's a mental game, guys.</font>

1655
01:10:25,961 --> 01:10:26,962
It's easy to get past.</font>

1656
01:10:30,833 --> 01:10:31,133
-All right, fuck it.</font>

1657
01:10:31,717 --> 01:10:34,086
Yeah, I'm in.</font>

1658
01:10:34,086 --> 01:10:36,221
-Here's your--</font>

1659
01:10:36,222 --> 01:10:36,806
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): I'm in.</font>

1660
01:10:36,806 --> 01:10:37,807
I'm in.</font>

1661
01:10:38,307 --> 01:10:38,808
I'm in.</font>

1662
01:10:38,808 --> 01:10:40,727
-Nice.</font>

1663
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:41,761
Hold on.</font>

1664
01:10:41,761 --> 01:10:42,729
I don't trust him.</font>

1665
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:52,104
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): First
  to finish, 50 grand.</font>

1666
01:10:55,107 --> 01:10:57,109
What's going on, guys?</font>

1667
01:10:57,109 --> 01:10:58,861
What are you waiting for?</font>

1668
01:11:05,251 --> 01:11:06,252
Let's eat.</font>

1669
01:11:47,243 --> 01:11:47,877
-Oh, I'm done.</font>

1670
01:11:47,877 --> 01:11:49,078
-Done.</font>

1671
01:11:51,831 --> 01:11:53,833
-Shit, that was close.</font>

1672
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:54,334
Violet?</font>

1673
01:11:54,333 --> 01:11:55,000
VINCE (OFFSCREEN): No.</font>

1674
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,001
No, no, no.</font>

1675
01:11:56,001 --> 01:11:56,552
Clearly I won.</font>

1676
01:11:56,552 --> 01:11:57,720
Look.</font>

1677
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:58,804
Open your mouth.</font>

1678
01:11:58,804 --> 01:11:59,221
Open your mouth.</font>

1679
01:11:59,221 --> 01:12:00,172
-It's open.</font>

1680
01:12:00,172 --> 01:12:01,173
Ahh.</font>

1681
01:12:03,309 --> 01:12:05,812
-Fuck.</font>

1682
01:12:05,811 --> 01:12:10,432
Guys, that was a tie.</font>

1683
01:12:10,432 --> 01:12:12,851
-What?</font>

1684
01:12:12,852 --> 01:12:15,271
-Uh, we need a tiebreaker.</font>

1685
01:12:21,193 --> 01:12:22,411
Great idea.</font>

1686
01:12:25,998 --> 01:12:34,423
I guess whoever eats Craig's
   finger gets the money.</font>

1687
01:12:39,378 --> 01:12:39,879
-No.</font>

1688
01:12:39,879 --> 01:12:40,880
No, no.</font>

01:12:52,691 --> 01:12:54,193
-Crying like a motherfucker?</font>

[grunting]</font>

1692
01:13:30,346 --> 01:13:32,982
-That still counts, right?</font>

1693
01:13:32,982 --> 01:13:35,067
-It counts, Craig.</font>

1694
01:13:35,067 --> 01:13:37,152
You're the winner.</font>

1695
01:13:37,653 --> 01:13:40,656
-(CHUCKLING) I did it.</font>

1696
01:13:43,158 --> 01:13:47,162
50,000 fucking dollars.</font>

1697
01:13:47,162 --> 01:13:49,081
[laughing]</font>

1698
01:14:03,512 --> 01:14:07,016
-You're fucking weak, Craig.</font>

1699
01:14:07,016 --> 01:14:08,434
You always were.</font>

1700
01:14:14,974 --> 01:14:17,977
-Let's get you some air.</font>

1701
01:14:17,977 --> 01:14:19,479
There we go.</font>

1702
01:14:46,088 --> 01:14:47,673
-Oh, fuck.</font>

1703
01:14:47,673 --> 01:14:50,643
You know what, fuck him, man.</font>

1704
01:14:50,642 --> 01:14:55,680
You know, he used to get his
 ass beat, his fucking ass</font>

1705
01:14:55,681 --> 01:14:58,184
handed to him, all the time.</font>

1706
01:14:58,183 --> 01:14:59,685
And who would he
come crying to?</font>

1707
01:15:00,235 --> 01:15:01,737
To me.</font>

1708
01:15:01,737 --> 01:15:03,739
To me, and I would always
      have his back.</font>

1709
01:15:03,739 --> 01:15:07,192
I always had your back.</font>

1710
01:15:07,192 --> 01:15:11,246
And how does he fucking
     repay me, huh?</font>

1711
01:15:11,246 --> 01:15:13,198
By thinking he's fucking
    better than me.</font>

1712
01:15:15,751 --> 01:15:18,254
You know, he thinks he fucking
     deserves that money.</font>

1713
01:15:18,253 --> 01:15:20,255
He doesn't deserve shit--</font>

1714
01:15:20,255 --> 01:15:22,257
not a fucking dime.</font>

1715
01:15:27,763 --> 01:15:30,266
Fuck, man.</font>

1716
01:15:30,265 --> 01:15:31,767
I almost fucking killed him.</font>

1717
01:15:35,354 --> 01:15:36,856
-Why don't you do it?</font>

[chuckling]</font>

1719
01:15:45,898 --> 01:15:49,402
-Do it.</font>

1720
01:15:49,401 --> 01:15:52,654
$250,000.</font>

1721
01:15:52,654 --> 01:15:56,658
I'll take care of
 the rest of it.</font>

1722
01:15:56,658 --> 01:16:00,162
This is your chance, Vince.</font>

1723
01:16:00,162 --> 01:16:03,132
Fresh start.</font>

1724
01:16:03,132 --> 01:16:04,583
Living the life you want.</font>

1725
01:16:17,396 --> 01:16:31,911
-$250,000?</font>

1726
01:16:31,910 --> 01:16:34,746
-You want to play us
 a slideshow, baby?</font>

1727
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,583
She did this one for our
wedding, it's fucking killer.</font>

1728
01:16:42,588 --> 01:16:45,508
Craig, you want a
  beer or, like,</font>

1729
01:16:45,507 --> 01:16:47,959
an ice pack of something?</font>

1730
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,713
-Uh, cab.</font>

1731
01:16:50,712 --> 01:16:51,713
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Fuck,
     you know what?</font>

1732
01:16:51,713 --> 01:16:52,214
You're right.</font>

1733
01:16:52,714 --> 01:16:53,882
It's fucking late.</font>

1734
01:16:53,882 --> 01:16:56,935
Slash early.</font>

1735
01:16:56,935 --> 01:16:59,888
You know, I'm feeling
    kinda brunchy.</font>

1736
01:16:59,888 --> 01:17:00,889
You guys into that?</font>

1737
01:17:04,309 --> 01:17:05,310
-Yeah.</font>

1738
01:17:05,811 --> 01:17:06,812
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): I could
 pound, like, 100 Bloody</font>

1739
01:17:06,812 --> 01:17:08,280
Mary's right now.</font>

1740
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:12,451
CRAIG (OFFSCREEN): Hey Colin,
  can you call a cab for me?</font>

1741
01:17:12,451 --> 01:17:13,452
-Sure, man.</font>

1742
01:17:13,952 --> 01:17:16,288
But I'm paying for it.</font>

1743
01:17:16,788 --> 01:17:19,791
Because I'm a good host.</font>

1744
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:21,293
I got some guy--</font>

1745
01:17:21,293 --> 01:17:22,795
here we go.</font>

1746
01:17:26,748 --> 01:17:27,249
Oh, there we go.</font>

1747
01:17:27,749 --> 01:17:28,967
Ha, ha.</font>

1748
01:17:32,004 --> 01:17:34,256
The reunion shot.</font>

1749
01:17:34,256 --> 01:17:35,841
CRAIG (OFFSCREEN): Colin.</font>

1750
01:17:35,841 --> 01:17:36,342
COLIN (OFFSCREEN): Yes.</font>

1751
01:17:36,341 --> 01:17:37,843
OK, OK, OK.</font>

1752
01:17:45,767 --> 01:17:47,269
Hi, is this Central Cab?</font>

1753
01:17:47,769 --> 01:17:50,272
Yeah, to pick up.</font>

1754
01:17:50,272 --> 01:17:53,575
The address is 1231 Waverly.</font>

1755
01:17:53,575 --> 01:17:54,409
Oh, Craig.</font>

1756
01:17:54,409 --> 01:17:57,279
Go ahead and get your 50,000.</font>

1757
01:17:57,279 --> 01:17:58,580
I trust you.</font>

1758
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,165
Count it out.</font>

1759
01:18:00,616 --> 01:18:02,785
No, I was talking to a friend.</font>

1760
01:18:02,784 --> 01:18:14,846
All right, 20 minutes
   Oh shit, Vince.</font>

1761
01:18:15,347 --> 01:18:16,765
This shit was so funny.</font>

1762
01:19:22,164 --> 01:19:25,250
-Craig, let's get the
  fuck out of here.</font>

1763
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:27,202
[gunshot]</font>

1764
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:55,947
[gunshot]</font>

1765
01:20:15,334 --> 01:20:16,669
-Whoa, that was grim.</font>

1766
01:20:20,505 --> 01:20:21,973
That was grim.</font>

1767
01:20:53,038 --> 01:20:54,540
Hey.</font>

1768
01:20:54,539 --> 01:20:57,042
You know that--</font>

1769
01:20:57,042 --> 01:20:57,926
that maid service
 we talked about?</font>

1770
01:21:03,014 --> 01:21:04,265
Yeah, I need that now.</font>

1771
01:21:35,997 --> 01:21:37,499
It's been good partying
    with you, Craig.</font>

1772
01:22:03,742 --> 01:22:05,193
Good call on your boy.</font>

1773
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:11,283
I thought my guy was
 gonna wrap it up.</font>

1774
01:22:11,783 --> 01:22:12,784
[sigh]</font>

1775
01:23:37,869 --> 01:23:40,088
[baby crying]</font>

1776
01:23:47,596 --> 01:23:51,467
-Oh, it's OK.</font>

1777
01:23:51,716 --> 01:23:53,301
[crying]</font>

1778
