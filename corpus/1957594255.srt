00:00:01,551 --> 00:00:04,384
(Multicom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,226 --> 00:00:15,726
(light music)

3
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,463
- [Man] So Crystal was by herself,

4
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,313
and this is when your
father came into the room?

5
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:28,802
What happened then?

6
00:00:28,802 --> 00:00:30,571
- He's layin' over her like he was

7
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:32,600
gonna help her with her
homework or somethin',

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,368
but what he was really doin'
was lookin' down her dress.

9
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,840
(audience gasps)

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,094
- [Man] How did your mother react to this?

11
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:42,720
- Like it wasn't happenin'.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,370
My mama shoulda been born one of them

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,363
birds that stick their head in the sand.

14
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,760
- [Man] An ostrich?

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,593
- Yeah, exactly.

16
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,283
She shoulda been born a ostrich.

17
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,850
- So your mother

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,970
ignored what was going on between Crystal

19
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,150
and your father?

20
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,440
- Yeah, just like always.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,070
And then Daddy starts telling Crystal

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,450
how pretty she is, how
he bets that all the boys

23
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,101
can't hardly keep their hands of her

24
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:18,640
and how if he was 16 again,
he'd be chasin' after her too.

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,540
- [Woman] Everything is so elaborate.

26
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,640
I mean, at Margolis, we
were all sort of shoehorned

27
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,110
into these cubby holes.

28
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,760
- Oh, Howard's show is a first-class ride.

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,010
He insists on it so does Sadie.

30
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,070
- Are you sure I don't
need an appointment?

31
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,720
- Trust me, it's better this way.

32
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:33,814
- It's hot, ain't it?

33
00:01:33,814 --> 00:01:35,746
A real scorcher of a night.

34
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:37,993
A night like this, ain't
nothin' better than a ice cream.

35
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:40,331
- [Man] Hey, she has
her father's mustache.

36
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:42,914
(men laughing)

37
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,820
- And Crystal over here,
she says she's the same way.

38
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,490
How when it gets hot and close

39
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,370
and she gets to feelin' sticky all over

40
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,500
and all she can think
about is the ice cream.

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,650
And then the two of them,
they go off together

42
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,256
like they was on a date or something.

43
00:01:59,256 --> 00:02:00,212
(audience groans)

44
00:02:00,212 --> 00:02:01,890
- I got to go prep the next one, okay?

45
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,253
- [Host] Okay, we've
heard from Lucille-Ann.

46
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,730
- Now there are two green rooms.

47
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,230
Ever since Sadie came on board,

48
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,080
she likes to keep the
opposing sides separated,

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,850
so if there's a fight, it happens in front

50
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,294
of the camera as opposed to back here.

51
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:15,518
You know what she calls them?

52
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:17,114
Holding pens.

53
00:02:17,114 --> 00:02:18,029
- That's terrible.

54
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:23,029
- (laughs) Well, wait until
you meet some of the guests.

55
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:23,940
- Teri, Sadie needs you on the floor.

56
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,200
- Okay, 30 seconds, Jimmy.

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,532
Just give me 30 seconds.

58
00:02:26,532 --> 00:02:27,840
And remember, be honest with him.

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,390
Tell him everything you told me.

60
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,490
They'll be with you every step of the way.

61
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:33,507
- Oh, Teri, this is--

62
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:34,812
- Not now, later, sorry.

63
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:35,645
- Hi, bye.

64
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:37,327
- That's Teri.

65
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:38,160
She's one of Sadie's people.

66
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,520
She's a little tense.

67
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,043
- Yeah, oh, I'm starting to feel

68
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:43,299
like I should've stayed in Chicago.

69
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:44,610
- No, come on.

70
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,730
You belong right here in New York with me.

71
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,880
All you gotta do is
sell yourself to Sadie.

72
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:53,235
That didn't come out quite right, did it?

73
00:02:53,235 --> 00:02:58,235
(audience applauding)
- Randy, come on out.

74
00:02:58,853 --> 00:03:01,477
- When is she going to cry?

75
00:03:01,477 --> 00:03:02,310
- Cry?

76
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,120
- Dammit, Teri, do you want our audience

77
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,140
surfing off to Oprah?

78
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,560
I told you, I want tears or a fight

79
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,283
within the first segment.

80
00:03:09,283 --> 00:03:10,123
- Okay.

81
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:13,033
- [Howard] Crystal be
honest, level with me.

82
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,296
You're an attractive young woman,

83
00:03:14,296 --> 00:03:15,406
you had to know people
- Right,

84
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:16,334
just between you and me.
- would start to talk

85
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:17,433
when you began spending time

86
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:19,500
with a married man almost twice your age.

87
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,220
- Sadie wants you to
stay off Howard's back.

88
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,800
His battery pack's showing
through his jacket.

89
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,150
- Sadie wants you on the floor now!

90
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,983
- Okay!

91
00:03:25,983 --> 00:03:28,650
- Butt shots, I need lots of butt shots.

92
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,470
- Howard Grant is wired?

93
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,730
- Sadie's idea.

94
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,410
She's into cue cards too.

95
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,863
She doesn't like him
working without a net.

96
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:35,823
- What the hell were you doing?

97
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:37,771
It is a five minute drive
to the Dairy Queen, okay?

98
00:03:37,771 --> 00:03:39,244
You guys were gone for an hour!

99
00:03:39,244 --> 00:03:41,770
- Ask him why his wife
didn't join him on the show.

100
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,518
Howard, come on, this is falling apart.

101
00:03:43,518 --> 00:03:45,638
- [Randy] Hey, hey, hey, we wasn't gone

102
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:46,830
for more than 20 minutes.
- Hang on, hang on a second

103
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,110
now, Randy, hey, come on.

104
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,240
Folks, take a breath now.

105
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,430
Wait just a second.

106
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,880
Randy, question for you now.

107
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,848
Why didn't your wife join us on the show?

108
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:56,348
- [Audience] Yeah?

109
00:04:03,478 --> 00:04:05,240
- Wasn't that scarecrow here last week?

110
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,210
- Hello, we interrupting your nap?

111
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,050
Take three.

112
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,730
She's here every week.

113
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,790
- How did she slip by Alan?

114
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,623
- Take two.

115
00:04:11,623 --> 00:04:12,456
Alan loves her.

116
00:04:12,456 --> 00:04:13,620
She asks great questions.

117
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,761
Ready four.

118
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:16,470
Take four.
- You are nothin' but a slut.

119
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,303
Okay?

120
00:04:17,303 --> 00:04:18,211
You nothin' but a slut.

121
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:21,082
- [Director] Three, pull back.

122
00:04:21,082 --> 00:04:22,100
- Well, we're certainly not shy

123
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,530
of our opinions here on
the Howard Grant Show.

124
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,570
What happens when flirtation
becomes seduction?

125
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,180
When we come back,
- Ready bumper, take two.

126
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,760
- we'll introduce you to a
young woman with the answer.

127
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,030
- Music up.

128
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,947
Cue bumper.

129
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,026
And fade.

130
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:48,690
- [Teri] Okay, you're up next.

131
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,190
- Oh, I don't think I can do this.

132
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,660
- Sure you can.

133
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,950
You're gonna go out there,

134
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,260
you're gonna tell your story,

135
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,770
and you're going to feel a whole lot

136
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,080
better for it afterward.

137
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,630
I've seen it over and over.

138
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,410
People hold a thing inside,
it eats away at them.

139
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,730
They come on the show, they
get it out in the open.

140
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,900
(fingers snap)
They get rid of it!

141
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,990
- Oh, I don't know.

142
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,950
- It's gonna be fine.

143
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,040
I'll be right there,

144
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,657
and I'll support you all the way.

145
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:14,420
But remember, you've
got to get the audience

146
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,430
on your side, so be honest.

147
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,693
Tell them everything you told me, okay?

148
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,393
- Okay.

149
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:21,226
- Okay, good.

150
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:25,730
- Your mother and I--
- Look, Dad, you're

151
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,660
not even listening to me.

152
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,880
- I am, and I want to hear
your side of the story,

153
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,910
but this isn't the time

154
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,000
or the place.
- Dad, I am not

155
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,833
one of your guests,

156
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,470
and I'm not gonna let
you talk to me like one!

157
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,303
- [Howard] Ted.

158
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:36,453
- Dad, just do the show.

159
00:05:37,843 --> 00:05:39,088
(bell ringing)

160
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:39,921
- Bad timing.

161
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:41,110
- Thank God, you saved my life.

162
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,943
Hurry, there's no time.

163
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:43,051
Come on, come on.
- This is Alan,

164
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,328
our audience coordinator.

165
00:05:44,328 --> 00:05:47,078
- [Alan] Come on, I'm dying here.

166
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:49,014
- Are you okay?

167
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:49,977
- Yes.

168
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:51,677
He's just going through something.

169
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,050
- Empty seat's the kiss of
death, you know what I mean?

170
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,487
Smile.

171
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:01,830
(upbeat music)

172
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,997
(audience applauding)

173
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,540
- We've been talking to young women

174
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,500
whose fathers flirt with their friends.

175
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,720
But what happens when dad's
flirtations turn serious?

176
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,333
Meet Wanda, whose best
friend is now her mother.

177
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,408
(audience ohs)

178
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:24,575
(audience applauding)

179
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,950
Wanda, help me out here.

180
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,470
You and your father used
to be close, didn't you?

181
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,180
- We was real close.

182
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,500
My mama died when I was born and all,

183
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,790
but that was before him and Thelma

184
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,514
started, uh, sleepin' together.

185
00:06:46,514 --> 00:06:48,310
(audience groans)

186
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,783
It just tore us apart.

187
00:06:51,942 --> 00:06:54,903
And then they got married.

188
00:06:54,903 --> 00:06:57,130
I couldn't believe it.

189
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:57,963
I still can't.

190
00:06:57,963 --> 00:06:58,796
- She's going down.

191
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,770
She's going down.

192
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,410
- I started
- Tighter.

193
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,360
- to put on weight.

194
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,876
It's just that I miss
him so much. (crying)

195
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:12,262
- She's down!

196
00:07:12,262 --> 00:07:13,179
She's down!

197
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,812
- I ain't standin' back
there and listenin' no more.

198
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:20,300
(audience groans)

199
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,281
- This is

200
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:22,930
- I'm telling you, he's great for Thelma.

201
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,130
- This is Vernon, Wanda's father,

202
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,878
and his wife Thelma.

203
00:07:26,878 --> 00:07:28,303
- Go home!

204
00:07:31,097 --> 00:07:33,963
- And they're anxious to
tell their side of the story.

205
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,473
- No story to tell.

206
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,743
We met, we fell in love,
and we got married.

207
00:07:41,582 --> 00:07:42,590
- That's right.

208
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,510
- [Vernon] Now what's
the harm in that, huh?

209
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,954
- Well.

210
00:07:45,954 --> 00:07:47,430
- I think Wanda here, I think

211
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,939
she's just jealous, that's all.

212
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:51,300
- That's right.
- Daddy!

213
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,310
- Jealous?
- Hell, yes.

214
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,516
She's used to havin' me all to herself.

215
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,163
(audience groans)

216
00:07:57,163 --> 00:07:58,040
Just, just don't sit right with her

217
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,190
now she's got to share.

218
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,940
- Are you saying--

219
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,827
- I'm sayin', I'm man
enough for both of 'em.

220
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:07,131
- [Audience] Oh!

221
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:08,436
- Daddy.

222
00:08:08,436 --> 00:08:09,269
- Yes!

223
00:08:10,955 --> 00:08:11,788
- Plenty to go around, huh?

224
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,833
- I felt like I was refereeing a wreck.

225
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,010
But shows like this pay for the ones

226
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,843
that really matter.

227
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:35,560
We feed the audiences
transvestites and strippers

228
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,800
and then hit them with
something really thoughtful,

229
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,600
like next week's segment
on race and intelligence.

230
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,590
- I will never forget the
show you did on the Klan.

231
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,570
I mean, I saw that one and I knew,

232
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,359
well, that I had to work in talk.

233
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:50,028
- You know, I'm really
embarrassed about today's show.

234
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:50,861
- Oh, no.

235
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:52,150
- Excuse me, Howard.

236
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,840
Diane's been summoned.

237
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,712
- Oh, well, it was really,
really nice meeting you.

238
00:08:56,712 --> 00:08:57,545
- You too.

239
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:00,943
- [Sadie] Talk to me.

240
00:09:00,943 --> 00:09:01,820
What have you done?

241
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,180
- Well, I majored in communications

242
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,109
at Iowa State, and then I did the news

243
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:06,350
at WNXT in Chicago--

244
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,910
- I'm not interested in news.

245
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,510
I'm interested in talk.

246
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,010
- Diane was an AP at the Margolis Show.

247
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,710
She'd made producer,
then they got canceled.

248
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,450
- Well, we don't do issues here.

249
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,955
We don't do issues, not anymore--

250
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,890
- I know, but I--
- We do theater.

251
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,290
Confrontation, conflict,
drama, that's what

252
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,520
the audiences are buying,
that's what we're selling.

253
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,470
You want to do issues,
you talk to Bill Moyers.

254
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,950
Issues killed Margolis.

255
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,800
It almost killed Howard.

256
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,150
Look, Jenny says that you're okay,

257
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,410
so I'm gonna give you a chance,

258
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,380
one month, four shows.

259
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,170
You deliver, you're on staff.

260
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,490
You let me down, you join Margolis

261
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,760
in the unemployment line.

262
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,870
- I never made producer at Margolis.

263
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,490
- Oh come on, scruples
or some of the collection

264
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,860
of overdue bills?

265
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,693
Look, you didn't have the title,

266
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:52,000
but you did the work.

267
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,220
Besides, his show is gone.

268
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,743
Who's she gonna check with?

269
00:09:54,743 --> 00:09:55,576
- You're so bad, Jenny.

270
00:09:55,576 --> 00:09:56,775
- And you are a producer.

271
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:59,192
(rock music)

272
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,620
- He practically invented talk, Mom!

273
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,520
I know.

274
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,353
I know that.

275
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:07,520
He's really embarrassed about that too.

276
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,227
It's just this new executive
producer that he has.

277
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,530
You know, next week's
shows are gonna be a lot.

278
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,820
Wait, what?

279
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,147
I, you know what, I
can't hear you very well.

280
00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:18,800
Why don't I, I'll call you back

281
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,960
when my phone gets hooked back up.

282
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,793
Yeah.

283
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:22,626
I love you.

284
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,030
I'm gonna make you proud, Mom.

285
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:27,409
Tell Dad I love him too.

286
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:28,242
Bye.

287
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,222
- Hey, what'd they say?

288
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,950
- Well, they said that
Howard was beginning

289
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,420
to sound a little like Geraldo,

290
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,200
and maybe I should come home.

291
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,243
- Oh yeah, Howard is still Howard.

292
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:47,080
He's just been fightin' for his life.

293
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,560
I mean, when the ratings come back--

294
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,563
- Yeah, I know.

295
00:10:49,563 --> 00:10:50,810
I know, and in the
meantime, I figure I can

296
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,750
convince Sadie to do anything
with a sensationalistic

297
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,993
hook to it, even if it
does have some meat on it.

298
00:10:55,993 --> 00:10:58,190
- I don't know, Diane.

299
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,270
Sadie's not into causes.

300
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,220
You do the sort of thing you
were pushing at Margolis--

301
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,220
- Look, I am gonna do the kind of shows

302
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,340
I wanna do by convincing
Sadie that they're

303
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,290
the kind of shows that she wants to do.

304
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:12,680
Ooh, who is the hunk?

305
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,183
- Mark Holston.

306
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,950
Outside counsel to the show.

307
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,320
He just bailed us out
of a $10 million lawsuit

308
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,010
by taking the plaintiff
apart on the stand.

309
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,037
Sadie's been panting after him ever since.

310
00:11:26,037 --> 00:11:27,950
So he works on Sadie by night

311
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,780
and the Lula Belle Barton
case by day. (laughs)

312
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,630
It's kinda like watching cobras mate.

313
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,409
- What is this?

314
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:39,270
- A celebration.

315
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,103
It's on Sadie.

316
00:11:40,103 --> 00:11:41,200
She just doesn't know it.

317
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,603
To money in the bank and
life in the fast lane.

318
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,977
- Don't hang up, okay?

319
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:51,540
No, don't hang up.

320
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,680
Look, I don't think you
understand the situation here.

321
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,630
I told Howard you were coming,

322
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,310
and he's dying to meet you.

323
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,948
He's.

324
00:11:57,948 --> 00:11:58,984
Damn!

325
00:11:58,984 --> 00:11:59,817
- I don't have a show.

326
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:00,800
- What?
- I don't have a show.

327
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,633
- [Teri] Neither do I, Myra.

328
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:02,890
Now go to your kennel and let me slash

329
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,790
my wrists in peace.

330
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,461
(rapid music)

331
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:08,762
- I don't have a--
- I know, Myra.

332
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:09,595
You don't have a show.

333
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,419
And neither will I unless
you stop pestering me.

334
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:15,419
(people chattering)

335
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:20,490
- [Myra] I don't have a show.

336
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,440
- You must be Myra.

337
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,100
Hi, I'm Diane.

338
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,200
- Welcome to the rack.

339
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,110
- Congratulate me, girls,
the warden has given

340
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,593
me my release.
- Oh, God.

341
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,983
- [Woman] What are you gonna do, huh?

342
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,350
- I don't know, dig ditches, clean sewers.

343
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,860
Something with dignity.

344
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,883
- There goes another
one of Howard's people.

345
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,570
- It's 11 o'clock, guys.

346
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,760
The dragon lady awaits.

347
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,630
- Terrific.

348
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,653
Another great story ruined by checking.

349
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,960
We're taping your segment tomorrow, Myra.

350
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,850
I'm going to be very annoyed if we don't

351
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,530
have anything to put
in front of the camera.

352
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,500
Alex, talk to me.

353
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,170
What have you got?

354
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,540
- Girls in gangs, pretty
much virgin territory.

355
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,520
- There's no such thing
in talk, not anymore.

356
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,810
You got rival gang members?

357
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,280
- And their boyfriends.

358
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,113
- That's good.

359
00:13:10,113 --> 00:13:11,310
Tell Nick to beef up security.

360
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,913
Okay, new girl on the
block, let's hear it.

361
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,630
- I was looking over last month's shows,

362
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,930
and I saw that Howard's ratings really

363
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,990
went through the roof when he went

364
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,280
out on the street and
talked to prostitutes.

365
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,430
So I thought we could bring back one

366
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,263
of those girls and maybe bring--

367
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:29,076
- Howard's got to talk to you.

368
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:30,800
He says it can't wait.

369
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,173
- Back in five, folks.

370
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,193
- Okay, what's that all about?

371
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,770
- You should try reading the trades.

372
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:43,090
- He's upset about the
announcement from United Media.

373
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,265
They're giving his son a talk show.

374
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:47,240
- Why would that make him upset?

375
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,073
It's his son.

376
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:49,013
- Demographics.

377
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:50,952
He doesn't want to compete

378
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:52,910
with a younger version of himself.

379
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,790
Unless I miss my guess,

380
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,750
he's out there wringing his hands.

381
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,563
A pound of flesh, that's
what he's taking from me.

382
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:03,237
All these Saturday meals will
take a piece of my heart.

383
00:14:03,237 --> 00:14:04,070
(people laughing)

384
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:04,903
- Bravo, Alex.

385
00:14:04,903 --> 00:14:06,080
But I catch you again,
and your act's going

386
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,573
to be canceled, permanently.

387
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,340
Now, prostitutes.

388
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,640
Is there one hooker in this entire city

389
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,755
that hasn't guested on a talk show?

390
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:17,800
(some people laugh)

391
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,150
- We've had most of them
right here on our own.

392
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,113
- But we haven't had their families.

393
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,120
Most of these girls are addicts.

394
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,953
I mean, we know that.

395
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:30,600
That's why they're out
there hooking, right?

396
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,330
I mean, that's double impact right there.

397
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,880
We bring their families on with them,

398
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,240
and that dramatizes the human cost,

399
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,693
the other victims in
this victimless crime.

400
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,640
- Well, what have we got
here, boys and girls?

401
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,753
Could it be, a new angle?

402
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,810
That's what I like about fresh blood.

403
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,883
Okay, you got it.

404
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:59,060
Now, one last thing, the
party Wednesday evening

405
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,290
for the stations that carry the show.

406
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,320
Everyone attends.

407
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,290
These people are our
bread and butter, folks,

408
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,860
and I want every last one of them

409
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,860
to feel a part of our happy little family.

410
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,693
Understand?

411
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,680
Okay, get out of here and get to work.

412
00:15:16,814 --> 00:15:17,647
(pulsing music)

413
00:15:17,647 --> 00:15:19,010
- [Prostitute] Whatever,
the only action around here,

414
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,222
if you know what I mean.

415
00:15:20,222 --> 00:15:21,564
And besides, in my line of work,

416
00:15:21,564 --> 00:15:23,615
we like to keep what
we call a low profile.

417
00:15:23,615 --> 00:15:25,204
- Yeah, I completely understand that.

418
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:26,563
There would be no cops.

419
00:15:27,453 --> 00:15:28,986
- Well, college girl,

420
00:15:28,986 --> 00:15:30,697
(speaking in foreign language)

421
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:34,467
But you see, there's one
other little problem.

422
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,208
It's been a while since
I've seen my mother,

423
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,791
10, 12 years maybe.

424
00:15:39,786 --> 00:15:42,291
I don't even know what she looks like.

425
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,124
- You know what, it's okay.

426
00:15:43,124 --> 00:15:43,957
Thank you.

427
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:46,596
- Hey, hey, you looking
for some salsa tonight?

428
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:47,429
Her?

429
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:49,091
Hey, hey, come on.

430
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:50,661
Honey, it's a career opportunity.

431
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:52,328
He's asking for you.

432
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:56,191
- What's up, babe?

433
00:15:56,191 --> 00:15:57,790
- [Sadie] And?

434
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,740
- [Diane] Well, I guess you could say

435
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,373
he offered to sponsor me.

436
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,250
- I'm thrilled for you,

437
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,960
but the bottom line is
you don't have a guest.

438
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,143
No guest, no show.

439
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,953
Sit down.

440
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,790
Look, I like you, kid.

441
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,623
You got guts.

442
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:15,880
It took guts to lie to me that you

443
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,160
produced for Margolis.

444
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,249
You thought I wouldn't check,

445
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:21,210
and it took guts for you to go

446
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,610
out on the street like that.

447
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,100
Look, if you want to be a success in talk,

448
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,360
you gotta use your head too.

449
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,123
So let me give you some advice.

450
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,910
Never tell a lie you can get caught in.

451
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,820
Never hit the streets without backup.

452
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,220
And never, ever admit to failure.

453
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,970
Now, this is a good idea you have,

454
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,440
but it's not gonna amount to much

455
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,740
if you go out on the street

456
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,220
and you get yourself whacked.

457
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,790
I had Jimmy yank the letters that came in

458
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,713
after last month's show on prostitutes.

459
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,217
Unless I've missed my guess,

460
00:16:54,217 --> 00:16:56,830
what you're looking for,
you'll find right there.

461
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,170
- Thanks.

462
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,263
Thanks, Sadie.

463
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:00,940
- I don't want thanks.

464
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,123
I want a killer show.

465
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,883
(phone buzzes)

466
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,707
Hello.

467
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:09,200
- [Secretary] Mark Holston on two.

468
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,800
- [Sadie] Yeah, put him through.

469
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:14,560
(tense music)

470
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,450
- Sure, I can believe it.

471
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,420
My girlfriend's the same way.

472
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,630
- Your girlfriend?

473
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,187
- [Alex] I lie all the time, don't you?

474
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:23,800
- No, she doesn't, Alex,
and neither should you.

475
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,810
- No one's calling me back.

476
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,680
I might as well start
clearing out my desk.

477
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,290
- Oh yeah, you should do that, Myra.

478
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,123
- They won't call back.

479
00:17:29,123 --> 00:17:30,187
I know they won't.

480
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:31,020
(phone ringing)

481
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,520
Hello.

482
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,480
How the hell are you?

483
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,340
Listen, I'm so glad you called.

484
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,930
That story of yours is the
funniest thing I ever heard.

485
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:38,763
- Jenny.

486
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:44,850
Listen to this.

487
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,160
Dear Howard, I am writing to you

488
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,530
because I don't know where to turn.

489
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,870
Every day, my daughter breaks my heart.

490
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,450
She's only 19, but her
life is already over.

491
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,690
She's a drug-addicted prostitute

492
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,920
and the mother of a two-year-old girl.

493
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,560
I am at my wit's end with her,

494
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,891
but your show gives me hope.

495
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:04,724
- Oh.

496
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:05,557
- This is it.

497
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:06,600
I mean, this is the one.

498
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,110
I can help these people.

499
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,310
I can put the daughter
through a treatment program.

500
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,770
I can show the audience what the cost

501
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,270
of prostitution is, and I can give Sadie

502
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,523
ratings to die for.

503
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,933
- I love subways.

504
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,631
You get all those suits down there

505
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:24,820
in the filth and darkness rubbing elbows

506
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,190
with the derelicts and the rest

507
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,680
of the sewage from the slums.

508
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,780
It's the same thing in talk.

509
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,820
We take the audience for a tour

510
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,100
of the underbelly, the lower depths,

511
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,330
and we introduce them
to the ghetto garbage

512
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,440
and the trailer trash.

513
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,300
And then we send them back to their clean,

514
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,653
safe little lives.

515
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,910
That's why this piece of yours is perfect.

516
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,680
The audience can shake its head.

517
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,753
Isn't that tragic?

518
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,380
Then go to sleep happy because it's not

519
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,753
their daughter who's
out hooking for a fix.

520
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,620
So how did you talk this
girl into coming on the show?

521
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:12,400
- Oh, um, well, I haven't
actually spoken with her.

522
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,306
I spoke to her mom,
and her mom seemed to--

523
00:19:14,306 --> 00:19:15,670
- Wait a minute.

524
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,043
You come in here, and you tell me you

525
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:18,937
want to build a whole
show around this girl

526
00:19:18,937 --> 00:19:20,620
and her family, and now you're telling me

527
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,830
you haven't even talked to her?

528
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,050
- Sadie, nobody knows
exactly where she is.

529
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,330
If you just give me a few days,

530
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,300
I'm sure--
- Forget it.

531
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,690
Your show tapes on Friday.

532
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,932
You find another girl.

533
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:30,310
(phone buzzes)

534
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,373
Or find another job.

535
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,743
I'm in a meeting.

536
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,743
It's for you.

537
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,133
- Hello?

538
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:53,280
Sadie, Sadie, it's the mother.

539
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,790
It's her.

540
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,183
Yes, um, this is Diane Shepherd.

541
00:19:58,183 --> 00:19:59,750
- [Woman] Oh, thank God!

542
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,710
- Have you found Kelly yet?

543
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,450
- [Woman] Well, she's here,
but her pimp's with her.

544
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,037
And I'm scared, and she's
looking really sick.

545
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,950
And he's trashing the
place looking for money.

546
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,902
I've never--

547
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:08,921
(dial tone humming)

548
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:11,671
(dramatic music)

549
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,617
- Okay, this girl may
balk at doing the show.

550
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,330
If she does, figure out what she wants

551
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,704
and then you offer it to her.

552
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:23,010
Remember to wait for the camera crew.

553
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,790
They spend a lot of time on the streets.

554
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,297
They know how to handle themselves,

555
00:20:27,297 --> 00:20:29,742
so don't go in without them, okay?

556
00:20:29,742 --> 00:20:30,575
- Okay.

557
00:20:30,575 --> 00:20:31,811
- Oh, here.

558
00:20:31,811 --> 00:20:33,352
- Thanks.
- All right.

559
00:20:33,352 --> 00:20:34,185
Good luck.

560
00:20:40,211 --> 00:20:42,711
(tense music)

561
00:20:55,652 --> 00:20:59,569
(speaking in foreign language)

562
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:02,864
- Check it out.

563
00:21:02,864 --> 00:21:05,614
(dramatic music)

564
00:21:15,755 --> 00:21:18,255
(baby crying)

565
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,538
(people yelling)

566
00:21:26,538 --> 00:21:28,287
- [Man] Here we go, my fault.

567
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,986
(something breaking)
It's always my fault!

568
00:21:29,986 --> 00:21:32,512
Oh, it's never your fault.

569
00:21:32,512 --> 00:21:35,262
(people yelling)

570
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:49,050
- [Man] Yeah?

571
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,150
- Um hello, is this the Reilly residence?

572
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,663
- I don't know, might be.

573
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,470
Hey, uh, uh, Brenda.

574
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,844
What's your last name?

575
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:00,104
- [Brenda] I want you outta here!

576
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:02,014
- [Woman] Reilly.

577
00:22:02,014 --> 00:22:05,431
- Looks like you came to the right place.

578
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:12,602
- I tossed the whole room
- Uh huh.

579
00:22:12,602 --> 00:22:14,547
- and nothing.

580
00:22:14,547 --> 00:22:15,600
Who's that?

581
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,850
- [Man] I don't know.

582
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,933
- Hi, I'm Diane Shepherd.

583
00:22:18,933 --> 00:22:19,766
- What did you get?

584
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:20,599
What did you dig up?

585
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,432
- Nothing.

586
00:22:21,432 --> 00:22:23,099
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

587
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:26,472
- You wouldn't happen to have a little

588
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:27,960
something you could loan us?

589
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,800
See, we're experiencing a
little cash flow problem,

590
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,860
and Kelly here needs some groceries.

591
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,230
Don't you, honey?

592
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,390
- Sorry, I spent all my
money on the cab over here.

593
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,300
- Cab fare.

594
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,800
It's terrible, isn't it,
what them cabbies charge?

595
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,711
Nothing less than highway robbery.

596
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:48,544
I'll tell you what, why don't you take

597
00:22:48,544 --> 00:22:50,240
a little look-see in that purse of yours

598
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,863
just to kinda make sure?

599
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:06,739
Thank you.

600
00:23:07,896 --> 00:23:08,740
- That's it?

601
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,657
That's all?

602
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:12,383
Two lousy dollars?

603
00:23:12,383 --> 00:23:14,941
Boy, you travel light, don't you, honey?

604
00:23:14,941 --> 00:23:16,760
- Just like my mama
said, you want something

605
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,011
done right, do it yourself!

606
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:19,844
God!

607
00:23:24,134 --> 00:23:26,301
- Did you say who you are?

608
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,603
- Diane Shepherd.

609
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,200
I'm a producer from the Howard Grant Show.

610
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,400
I'd like to talk to you
about being a guest.

611
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,773
- That's real funny, Mom,

612
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,180
but I got an even better idea.

613
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:46,523
Why don't we all go on
American's Funniest Home Videos

614
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,150
and give the folks a real laugh.

615
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,319
- Kelly, they want to put
you in a treatment program.

616
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,500
They can help you get clean,

617
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,441
help you get little Joey back.

618
00:23:56,441 --> 00:23:58,639
- Uh, a treatment program.

619
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:00,290
I haven't heard that one before.

620
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,860
- [Grandmother] We just want our sweet

621
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,008
little girl back again.

622
00:24:07,008 --> 00:24:08,917
- Well, you know what I want?

623
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:10,240
I just want to get well.

624
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,160
- [Grandmother] Hey you, get outta there!

625
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,903
You know you're not welcome here!

626
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,550
How can you let him do this?

627
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,776
I held you, and I loved
you when you were a baby.

628
00:24:20,776 --> 00:24:21,609
When you took off with Jeri,

629
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:23,356
I was always here for you!

630
00:24:23,356 --> 00:24:24,725
- That's the problem!

631
00:24:24,725 --> 00:24:26,091
If you weren't always trying to take

632
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:27,787
her away from me, maybe I'd--

633
00:24:27,787 --> 00:24:29,095
- You were the one that was
always fightin' with her.

634
00:24:29,095 --> 00:24:30,453
- Shut up!

635
00:24:30,453 --> 00:24:31,932
You're always doing this!

636
00:24:31,932 --> 00:24:33,939
You're tearing me to pieces!

637
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,268
You're always like this!

638
00:24:35,268 --> 00:24:37,388
Go ahead, cry, cry, Mom!

639
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:38,221
Cry, cry!

640
00:24:39,702 --> 00:24:41,546
Oh baby, let's split.

641
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,296
- Oh, Brenda, Brenda.

642
00:24:45,244 --> 00:24:46,161
10, 15, 20.

643
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:48,042
20 bucks.

644
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:49,709
It's a start, right?

645
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,170
What did you say you did again?

646
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,480
- She just wants to
put me on some TV show.

647
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,313
- Oh yeah?

648
00:24:57,313 --> 00:24:58,430
- The Howard Grant Show.

649
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,500
- No kiddin'?

650
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,920
I know that show.

651
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,830
I know that show.

652
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,967
Well, you know, you should
be talkin' to me then,

653
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:06,523
'cause I'm Kelly's, I'm
her business manager.

654
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,840
How much they pay for one of them--

655
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,644
- That is none of your business.

656
00:25:10,644 --> 00:25:11,477
- Hey!

657
00:25:13,527 --> 00:25:16,502
What do they pay for one of
those uh guest appearances?

658
00:25:16,502 --> 00:25:20,000
- Well, um, ordinarily,
we don't pay our guests.

659
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,284
We just give them an opportunity

660
00:25:21,284 --> 00:25:23,390
to talk about whatever's bothering them.

661
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,510
- Yeah, yeah, but you wouldn't be opposed

662
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,900
to a little, uh, what's the word?

663
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,425
Help me out with this will ya?

664
00:25:30,425 --> 00:25:31,258
Honorarium!

665
00:25:31,258 --> 00:25:32,466
A little honorarium.

666
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:34,240
- Dwayne, please.

667
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,100
I gotta go.

668
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,700
- I know, I know!

669
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,823
I am just having a little
business conversation, all right?

670
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,362
- No, it's not all right.

671
00:25:42,362 --> 00:25:43,794
I am sick.

672
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:45,395
I have to go.

673
00:25:45,395 --> 00:25:47,124
Okay?
- Okay, okay.

674
00:25:47,124 --> 00:25:47,957
- We've been here for hours.

675
00:25:47,957 --> 00:25:48,790
- We gotta go.

676
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,930
We have to go on a little shopping trip.

677
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,230
Why don't you come along with us?

678
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,680
This way, we can continue
our little negotiation.

679
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,440
You want her on the show or not?

680
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:08,146
(tense music)

681
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:24,540
- Maybe, maybe we should wait for my car.

682
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,293
- I can't wait.
- Can you believe this?

683
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,126
- [Kelly] I can't wait.

684
00:26:27,126 --> 00:26:27,959
- It never fails.

685
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:28,792
When you don't want a cab,

686
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:31,253
the streets run yellow
with the damn things!

687
00:26:31,253 --> 00:26:32,086
(horn honking)

688
00:26:32,086 --> 00:26:33,390
Oh!

689
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,323
Am I poison?

690
00:26:36,787 --> 00:26:38,199
(Dwayne whistles)

691
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:39,299
All right, here we go.

692
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:41,551
- Wow, wait a minute.

693
00:26:41,551 --> 00:26:43,606
That's not a cab.
- Sure it is, sure it is.

694
00:26:43,606 --> 00:26:45,189
- No, it's not a cab.
- That is what you call

695
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:47,388
a entrepreneur, doesn't waste his time

696
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:48,914
on details like stupid paint jobs.

697
00:26:48,914 --> 00:26:50,423
- [Diane] But I don't think you sh.

698
00:26:50,423 --> 00:26:51,256
- Hang on.

699
00:26:56,387 --> 00:26:58,393
Avenue M and 14th Street.

700
00:26:59,443 --> 00:27:01,210
Now, where were we?

701
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,820
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

702
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,350
See what you've got to realize
is that Kelly is special.

703
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:09,100
She is just, she's real class.

704
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,280
She does not work the streets anymore.

705
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,443
Not since I've become
her business manager.

706
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,610
All of our business is strictly

707
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,950
by appointment only, if
you catch my meanin'.

708
00:27:21,383 --> 00:27:23,090
The way I figure it is she is worth

709
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:26,150
so much more than any
garden variety hooker

710
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,470
that you're just gonna pick up

711
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,300
on some street corner.

712
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,050
- Listen, buddy, I just remembered.

713
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,940
They got Central all blocked up.

714
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,773
Construction.

715
00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:36,543
We're gonna have to go
the long way around.

716
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,689
- The long way?

717
00:27:39,546 --> 00:27:40,953
- [Driver] Gonna have to charge you more.

718
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,450
- Really?

719
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,503
- [Driver] 20 bucks.

720
00:27:46,693 --> 00:27:48,500
- No kiddin'.

721
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,193
Well, whatever you think is fair.

722
00:27:57,613 --> 00:27:59,824
(dramatic music)

723
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:00,782
- What are you doing?
- Where I come from,

724
00:28:00,782 --> 00:28:02,470
a deal's a deal.
- What are you doing?

725
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,303
What is he doing?
- But one thing I can

726
00:28:03,303 --> 00:28:05,180
not abide by is a cheat.

727
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,036
So now I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask

728
00:28:07,036 --> 00:28:07,869
you to pull over.

729
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:09,286
- Oh God, please.

730
00:28:12,488 --> 00:28:13,488
- Frisk him.

731
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:17,711
Uh uh.

732
00:28:17,711 --> 00:28:18,810
- Ha ha!

733
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:19,750
Bingo.

734
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,577
- Are you offering me a cash settlement

735
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:24,110
over our little business dispute?

736
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,540
- Whatever you want, mister.
- But you know something,

737
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,610
it's not enough.

738
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,680
Now, if you were to throw in the car,

739
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,260
I might see my way clear
of calling us even.

740
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,650
- Sure, mister, sure.

741
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,547
- Oh, so we have a deal then?

742
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:35,846
- [Driver] Whatever you want, mister.

743
00:28:35,846 --> 00:28:37,190
- Good, you just open
up your car door there

744
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,353
and let yourself out.

745
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,450
(dramatic music)

746
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,703
Pleasure doing business with ya.

747
00:28:49,671 --> 00:28:50,880
So you understand what I'm saying, right?

748
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,890
That Kelly is just a very special girl,

749
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,620
and I think she deserves more than what

750
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,060
an ordinary guest would get.

751
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,670
Wouldn't you say?

752
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,210
- I do.

753
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,360
I do, but like I was trying to say before,

754
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,990
we don't ordinarily...

755
00:29:07,773 --> 00:29:09,380
You know what, I'm sure that we could

756
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,135
come up with some sort of an arrangement.

757
00:29:11,135 --> 00:29:11,988
- Good.

758
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:13,543
Good.

759
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:16,460
I was thinkin', I don't know, five.

760
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,651
- Well, I'd have to
talk to my boss, but I--

761
00:29:20,651 --> 00:29:22,151
- I ain't goin' on no TV show.

762
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,460
- Pleasure doing business with ya.

763
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,040
And now, if you will excuse us,

764
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,990
we have another little piece
of business to conduct inside.

765
00:29:43,455 --> 00:29:44,288
Be right back.

766
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,183
Hey, it's Dwayne, open up!

767
00:29:57,635 --> 00:29:59,052
Oh ho, what's up?

768
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,392
(bottle breaking)

769
00:30:15,424 --> 00:30:17,191
- [Diane] No!

770
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:18,883
- Open up the door!

771
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,332
Open the door!

772
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:23,156
- Jimmy, hi, it's Diane.

773
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:25,382
(horn honking)

774
00:30:25,382 --> 00:30:26,401
- Diane!

775
00:30:26,401 --> 00:30:27,234
Are you all right?

776
00:30:27,234 --> 00:30:28,067
- Yeah, Jimmy, I'm fine.

777
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:28,900
Quick, get out of the car.

778
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,300
I want to get some footage of this guy.

779
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,842
Oh come on, quick, before he gets away!

780
00:30:31,842 --> 00:30:33,009
Please, hurry!

781
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:39,180
- Dear Howard, I am writing
to you because I don't

782
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:44,280
know where to turn
(phone ringing)

783
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,579
- Cut.

784
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:46,489
- God.
- What?

785
00:30:46,489 --> 00:30:48,763
- I'm so sorry.
- Jimmy, dammit.

786
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:49,700
- What?

787
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,280
Hi.

788
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,668
Yeah.

789
00:30:52,668 --> 00:30:54,335
Diane, it's for you.

790
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,273
- Shepherd.

791
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:58,250
- [Sadie] Diane.

792
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,670
- Oh, Sadie, hi.

793
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,840
Yeah, yeah, I've been
trying to get in touch

794
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,011
with you all morning.

795
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:06,270
- Well, I understand you had
another little adventure.

796
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,130
- Yeah.

797
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,147
I know, the video crew hadn't shown up.

798
00:31:09,147 --> 00:31:11,100
- Did we have a conversation about backup,

799
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,120
or did I just imagine it?

800
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,953
- Oh, I know.

801
00:31:13,953 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm sorry, Sadie, I am.

802
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,640
- [Sadie] Why did you call?

803
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,990
- Okay, um, well, Kelly's boyfriend,

804
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,690
he wants $500, and I don't know what to do

805
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,150
because at Margolis we had a policy

806
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,370
never to pay our guests.

807
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,080
- Yeah, well, the money's on the way.

808
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,003
Get back to work.

809
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,813
- [Diane] Okay.

810
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,700
Where did she go?

811
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,533
- She's inside.

812
00:31:37,533 --> 00:31:38,366
She's having second thoughts.

813
00:31:38,366 --> 00:31:39,199
- [Diane] What?

814
00:31:48,914 --> 00:31:51,331
- You really think it's best?

815
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,640
- I know it is.

816
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:56,080
(gentle music)

817
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,280
This is right for Kelly.

818
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,970
It's gonna help her.

819
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,220
It's gonna help a lotta people.

820
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,053
Jeri, just think about it.

821
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:03,433
Think about the people watching the show.

822
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,520
If it turns around just one girl

823
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,870
who is heading in the
direction that Kelly was,

824
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:17,260
who knows, maybe it'll
keep a Dwayne out there

825
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,393
from exploiting a young girl like Kelly.

826
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,190
This is so important, Jeri.

827
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,730
It's important for Kelly.

828
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,020
It's important for you.

829
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,070
It's important for Brenda.

830
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,650
It's important for so many
people you don't even know.

831
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:35,631
- All right.

832
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:42,057
But you know I don't read so well.

833
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:47,100
Maybe you could just get
Howard to read my letter?

834
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,576
- Oh no, you have to read it.

835
00:32:48,576 --> 00:32:49,870
You read it so beautifully.

836
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,610
They're your words.

837
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,340
Just think about how you felt

838
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,200
when you wrote them, okay?

839
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,650
You hold onto that, and
everything'll be perfect.

840
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:05,240
- You talk to these girls
with such understanding,

841
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,260
and you treat them like human beings

842
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,260
instead of garbage that
belongs in the gutter.

843
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:18,660
So I know you will hear me too.

844
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:22,783
Please, Howard, help me save my daughter.

845
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:25,343
Help me stop the pain.

846
00:33:27,849 --> 00:33:30,816
(Jeri crying)
- Uh, cut.

847
00:33:30,816 --> 00:33:31,649
Cut.

848
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,814
Hey, you okay?
- I'm sorry.

849
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:38,098
- No.
- No, I just have such

850
00:33:38,098 --> 00:33:40,135
a hard time talking about this.

851
00:33:40,135 --> 00:33:41,185
- You were beautiful.

852
00:33:42,407 --> 00:33:45,200
You were just beautiful.

853
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,570
Uh, look, why don't you go back up

854
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,910
to your apartment, okay?

855
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,110
We'll be up to tape you
and Brenda together.

856
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,028
All right, um, let's get some B roll.

857
00:34:01,028 --> 00:34:03,130
Uh, the streets, garbage piles,

858
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,230
anything that'll give us a sense of place.

859
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:09,447
- Okay.

860
00:34:16,787 --> 00:34:18,622
One, two, three, four, five.

861
00:34:18,622 --> 00:34:20,030
- Listen, are you sure
she's okay about this?

862
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,395
- Oh yeah, of course she is, of course.

863
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:22,400
Yeah.

864
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,129
If she gives you any trouble at all.

865
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:25,473
You just, you know, you just talk to me.

866
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:28,681
Okay.

867
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,343
- Sure he talked to me, nice and sweet.

868
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,603
Said if I don't do it, he'd kill me.

869
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,883
- Well he was kidding, right?

870
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:46,340
- I said, "What am I,
a freak in a sideshow?"

871
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,367
He says, "If you don't do it,

872
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:52,560
"you're gonna be a side
of beef in a meat locker."

873
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:55,322
That's a big joke, huh?

874
00:34:57,638 --> 00:34:59,055
Look, I'll do it.

875
00:35:00,603 --> 00:35:02,653
Get the old broads off my back.

876
00:35:03,646 --> 00:35:05,546
I mean, why should I even care, right?

877
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,733
- Because you should care.

878
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,770
Kelly, this is gonna give you a chance

879
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,023
to get your life back.

880
00:35:16,596 --> 00:35:18,046
- When you get to where I am,

881
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,433
you don't go back.

882
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,160
I'm on the express, one
way to the end of the line.

883
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,513
It don't matter what I do.

884
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:35,331
They're not stoppin' the train for me.

885
00:35:41,508 --> 00:35:42,506
Will you give me a sec, okay.

886
00:35:42,506 --> 00:35:44,493
I gotta fix my face.

887
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,120
- Kelly?

888
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,953
- [Kelly] Yeah?

889
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,750
- Oh, I'm sorry.

890
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,299
We just, we really have to roll.

891
00:35:58,299 --> 00:36:01,330
(Kelly coughing)

892
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,223
Are you okay?

893
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:07,963
- I'm fine now.

894
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,030
Let's just get this over with.

895
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:15,933
- Smile.

896
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:19,942
Yeah, that's a pretty picture.

897
00:36:20,868 --> 00:36:22,080
Hey, is this all there is to this?

898
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,316
- [Diane] Jimmy, please.

899
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:24,149
Can you take care of this?

900
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:25,744
- [Dwayne] I can do this.

901
00:36:25,744 --> 00:36:28,363
- Okay, Kelly, please
sit in the red chair.

902
00:36:30,044 --> 00:36:31,090
- Oh God.

903
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,793
Kelly, not for the interview.

904
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,690
- Do you have no respect?

905
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,550
You do this terrible thing to yourself

906
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,820
in my house, in my bathroom?

907
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,653
- All right, Brenda.

908
00:36:41,653 --> 00:36:43,870
Um, Jeri, I need you to wait

909
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,743
in the other room, okay, until we're done.

910
00:36:46,743 --> 00:36:47,980
It's just that Kelly's gonna have a really

911
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,817
hard time with this, and I don't want

912
00:36:48,817 --> 00:36:50,273
her to be distracted.

913
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,233
Please.

914
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,873
Thank you.

915
00:37:03,028 --> 00:37:03,861
Okay.

916
00:37:09,907 --> 00:37:11,960
Are we rolling?
- Um hmm.

917
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,710
- Did you shoot up before this interview?

918
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,543
- It's good.

919
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,833
- Why, Kelly?

920
00:37:19,746 --> 00:37:24,344
- Mm.

921
00:37:24,344 --> 00:37:25,677
Look around you.

922
00:37:33,153 --> 00:37:36,835
- Kelly?

923
00:37:36,835 --> 00:37:37,668
Kelly?

924
00:37:37,668 --> 00:37:38,501
- Hmm?

925
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,800
- Kelly, why are you here?

926
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,063
- On TV?

927
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,770
- No, why are you here with your family?

928
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,913
- I needed some money.

929
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,010
- Does your family give
you money to buy drugs?

930
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,360
- No.

931
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,193
I take it.

932
00:38:11,913 --> 00:38:14,330
- How do you feel about that?

933
00:38:15,182 --> 00:38:17,932
(dramatic music)

934
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,600
What about prostitution, Kelly,

935
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,000
how does that make you feel?

936
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,297
Do you ever feel, uh?

937
00:38:26,297 --> 00:38:28,997
- Why do you keep on asking me how I feel?

938
00:38:36,537 --> 00:38:38,373
I don't feel anything.

939
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:40,523
- Kelly.

940
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,143
Kelly?

941
00:38:51,215 --> 00:38:52,048
- Honey.

942
00:38:54,616 --> 00:38:55,870
- What's happening?

943
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:56,826
- She's fine.

944
00:38:56,826 --> 00:38:58,110
- Oh my God.

945
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,824
Oh my God, is she overdosing?

946
00:38:59,824 --> 00:39:00,772
- Open your eyes, come on.

947
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:01,900
No, she's fine.

948
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,801
- Kelly?
- Kelly?

949
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:03,634
- [Dwayne] She's fine.

950
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:04,551
She's fine.

951
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,977
- Oh God, Jimmy, call 911.

952
00:39:10,472 --> 00:39:14,472
(everyone yelling)
- She's fine!

953
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,830
- No, Mom, he was right.

954
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,710
She was fine.

955
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,030
She just passed out.

956
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,863
Thank you.

957
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,610
Well, no, that's the whole point here.

958
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,903
We're trying to get her to
top being the victim, Mom.

959
00:39:26,903 --> 00:39:28,480
Mom, it's best if I don't talk

960
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,524
to you during work, okay?

961
00:39:29,524 --> 00:39:30,410
I.

962
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,243
Yeah, I'm sorry.

963
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,570
I'm just, I'm under a lot of pressure.

964
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,560
I was up all night.

965
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,043
I was editing the videotape, and. (sighs)

966
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,930
Look, my boss is coming in.

967
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:39,763
I gotta go, okay?

968
00:39:39,763 --> 00:39:41,450
I'll call ya later.

969
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,940
Yes, I love you too.

970
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,440
Bye.

971
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,450
- That's it?

972
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,480
- Um, well, no, there's more crying

973
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,560
at the tail end of the tape.

974
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,453
- (sighs) Play it out.

975
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,423
Lay some music over it,
something plaintive.

976
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,540
You dig up anything on her kid?

977
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,170
- Well, I spoke with social services,

978
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,150
and the record's sealed.

979
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,150
- Keep pushing.

980
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,850
There may be some way around that.

981
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:10,400
Okay, now, I want to intercut some footage

982
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,820
of Kelly working on the street.

983
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,540
Do you have anything we can use?

984
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,300
- Not yet, but I am meeting her and Dwayne

985
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,610
tonight at his office.

986
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,443
- His office?

987
00:40:17,443 --> 00:40:19,280
- A street corner in the Bronx.

988
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,110
- What makes you think they'll show?

989
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,603
- I had to offer a little incentive.

990
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,706
- Well, make sure we
get our money's worth.

991
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,710
One last thing, I want you to track down

992
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,520
a recovered addict that we can plant

993
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,690
in the audience.

994
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,493
You know, toss in a bone of hope.

995
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,314
- Three months?

996
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,330
Yeah, no, unfortunately, I need somebody

997
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:46,023
who is clean a little longer
than just three months.

998
00:40:47,397 --> 00:40:49,822
Yes, of course I understand.

999
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:50,655
(sexy music)

1000
00:40:50,655 --> 00:40:52,568
But if she's willing to come on.

1001
00:40:52,568 --> 00:40:53,850
Uh, could you hold on?

1002
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:54,683
- You Miriam?

1003
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,320
- Hi, I'm back.

1004
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,153
Um.

1005
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,140
Yeah, so if she's willing
to appear on the show,

1006
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,790
it would be great.

1007
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,000
- I'm Lana.

1008
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,290
- Oh, Miriam Reeder.

1009
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,625
Have a seat.

1010
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:08,500
- Thanks.

1011
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,109
- So did Jimmy explain the segment to you?

1012
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:17,109
- Yeah, housewives who strip? (laughs)

1013
00:41:18,128 --> 00:41:18,963
Your kids?

1014
00:41:18,963 --> 00:41:19,796
- Uh huh.

1015
00:41:19,796 --> 00:41:21,863
- Oh, they're really cute, yeah.

1016
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:25,053
So Jimmy told me that you're the one

1017
00:41:25,053 --> 00:41:28,280
who did the shows on body piercing

1018
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,443
and boyfriends who couldn't get enough?

1019
00:41:32,443 --> 00:41:34,750
Ah! (laughs)

1020
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,279
I really loved that one.

1021
00:41:36,279 --> 00:41:37,929
- Yeah, I'm the resident pervert.

1022
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:41,340
- No kiddin'.

1023
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,782
- Okay, gang, I'm takin' orders.

1024
00:41:42,782 --> 00:41:43,630
Miriam, what can I get ya?

1025
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,900
- Uh, boys of the Purple Pussycat.

1026
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,388
They're always rowdy.

1027
00:41:47,388 --> 00:41:48,334
And horny.
(Lana laughing and snorting)

1028
00:41:48,334 --> 00:41:49,167
- You got it.

1029
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:50,000
You know, for an extra buck,

1030
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,833
you can upgrade to a combo and get

1031
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:51,869
fries and a drink with that.

1032
00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:52,702
Enh, hee, hee.

1033
00:41:52,702 --> 00:41:53,535
Diane?

1034
00:41:54,606 --> 00:41:56,690
- [Diane] You know what, I'm
sorry, I don't understand.

1035
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:57,523
- What kind of audience do you want

1036
00:41:57,523 --> 00:41:59,181
for your hooker show, you know?

1037
00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:01,290
- (laughs) You're telling me
I can specify an audience?

1038
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,123
- Sure.

1039
00:42:02,123 --> 00:42:03,839
You know, we aim to
please and all that, eh?

1040
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,410
- Yeah, but at Margolis, we just had

1041
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,682
to take pot luck.

1042
00:42:06,682 --> 00:42:08,560
- Sadie doesn't like to
leave anything to chance.

1043
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,460
- You got that right.

1044
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,370
You want college kids?

1045
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,320
We got sororities and
frat houses we go to.

1046
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,380
You want the mature conservative types?

1047
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,213
We go to church groups.

1048
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:16,046
You want large people?

1049
00:42:16,046 --> 00:42:17,220
We hang out at the hot dog vendors.

1050
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,928
You want johns looking to pick
up transvestite prostitutes?

1051
00:42:19,928 --> 00:42:21,220
We head down to 42nd Street.

1052
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,163
You want Bible--
- Jenny?

1053
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,213
- What's with her?

1054
00:42:25,213 --> 00:42:26,145
Jenny?

1055
00:42:26,145 --> 00:42:27,083
Was it something I said?

1056
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:29,390
(Jenny sniffling)

1057
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:33,073
- They aired the show I
did on battered wives.

1058
00:42:34,097 --> 00:42:36,554
And one of the guests...

1059
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,520
- What is it?

1060
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,990
Jenny, come on, it's okay.

1061
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:39,823
What?

1062
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:41,523
It's okay.

1063
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,204
- Her husband saw the show,

1064
00:42:44,204 --> 00:42:45,333
and he beat her up,

1065
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:47,700
and she's in intensive care.

1066
00:42:49,578 --> 00:42:52,663
And they don't know if
she'll make it. (crying)

1067
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:57,278
- I'm sorry, come here.

1068
00:42:57,278 --> 00:42:58,111
I'm sorry.

1069
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:08,853
- Jenny.

1070
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,440
Did you beat up that woman?

1071
00:43:12,285 --> 00:43:13,640
Of course you didn't.

1072
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,623
You placed her in a halfway house,

1073
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:20,623
but she ran back to her husband, sweetie.

1074
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,950
So who's responsible
for what happened, huh?

1075
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:30,450
She is.

1076
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,783
She knew what he was.

1077
00:43:32,947 --> 00:43:34,390
But she went back to him anyway,

1078
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:36,740
in spite of everything
you tried to do for her.

1079
00:43:39,716 --> 00:43:42,030
The people we deal with are victims,

1080
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,813
and they will always be victims.

1081
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,620
The only mistake you made was to get

1082
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,883
involved emotionally.

1083
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,660
Come on.

1084
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,018
Let's tie one on.

1085
00:43:57,018 --> 00:43:58,518
What do you think?

1086
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:02,555
Okay.

1087
00:44:02,555 --> 00:44:04,888
(sad music)

1088
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,137
- [Prostitute] Hey, baby.

1089
00:44:14,137 --> 00:44:16,220
What you want, baby, huh?

1090
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:18,543
- Okay, cut.

1091
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,540
- What do you say we call it quits?

1092
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,255
We've got enough footage here for a movie.

1093
00:44:25,255 --> 00:44:26,310
- Yeah.

1094
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,060
Okay, let me just try and talk

1095
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,810
to our friend Dwayne one more time.

1096
00:44:32,363 --> 00:44:34,430
(pulsing music)

1097
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:36,672
Dwayne, it's 1:30, where is she?

1098
00:44:36,672 --> 00:44:37,793
- You're kiddin' me, already?

1099
00:44:37,793 --> 00:44:39,043
I don't have a.

1100
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,842
Well, it's probably like I told you.

1101
00:44:41,842 --> 00:44:43,910
She probably got all tied up

1102
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,650
in a business meeting. (laughs)

1103
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,740
- Really?

1104
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,330
Well, that's what you
told me two hours ago.

1105
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,163
Forget it.

1106
00:44:51,163 --> 00:44:51,996
We're outta here.

1107
00:44:51,996 --> 00:44:53,470
- Wait, wait.

1108
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:54,303
Wait.

1109
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,498
I just had an idea.

1110
00:44:56,498 --> 00:44:57,331
You know something?

1111
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:58,164
You don't even really need Kelly.

1112
00:44:58,164 --> 00:45:00,230
Lemme, lemme introduce you to Constance.

1113
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,063
Constance.

1114
00:45:02,062 --> 00:45:03,900
Now, she's freelance, but she has agreed

1115
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,760
to commission me on this.

1116
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,818
Turn around, honey.

1117
00:45:05,818 --> 00:45:07,030
Huh?

1118
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:07,863
- Forget it, Dwayne.

1119
00:45:07,863 --> 00:45:08,696
There's no deal.

1120
00:45:08,696 --> 00:45:10,700
You either deliver Kelly
or the whole thing is off.

1121
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,713
- Tough chick.

1122
00:45:15,651 --> 00:45:17,132
Pwew.

1123
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:20,150
- I am sorry, but we have
a strict policy, Lurleen.

1124
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,520
No teeth, no talk.

1125
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,980
Ye, yes, I know.

1126
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,370
I know, but we can't.

1127
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:27,640
As I said, we do have a strict policy.

1128
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,460
We have standards here
at the Howard Grant Show.

1129
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,720
- Producers of this show
have only one job, Diane,

1130
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,000
and that is to make me happy.

1131
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,807
Do I look happy?

1132
00:45:37,807 --> 00:45:39,200
(phone buzzes)

1133
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,363
I told you, no interruptions.

1134
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:43,663
Put her on.

1135
00:45:47,234 --> 00:45:49,270
I am not interested in
sick children, Miriam,

1136
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:50,710
yours or anyone else's.

1137
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:52,810
I am interested in your show.

1138
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:54,520
It is taping tonight at nine,

1139
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,430
with or without you.

1140
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:56,453
Which will it be?

1141
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,920
- I am going to give you
another chance, Diane.

1142
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,373
I am going to let you
take over Miriam's show.

1143
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,910
- Housewives that strip?

1144
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:10,352
- Jeffrey Madden from corporate

1145
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:12,720
is paying us a surprise visit tonight,

1146
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,320
and I want this show to be perfect.

1147
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,910
Understand?

1148
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,160
- Yes, Sadie, but I really don't think--

1149
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,203
- Get Miriam's book and get on it.

1150
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:25,760
- Okay, Teri, you have
to help me out here.

1151
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,250
Miriam has you down as an expert

1152
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,403
for the stripper show.

1153
00:46:28,403 --> 00:46:29,420
- Um hmm.

1154
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,810
It's you scratch my
back, I'll scratch yours.

1155
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:34,730
One of us comes up short a guest

1156
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:36,003
or an expert, the other steps in.

1157
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,120
I've been a guest twice now.

1158
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,170
This is my first time as an expert.

1159
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,950
- Fine, but what makes you--
- an expert?

1160
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,110
I had breast reduction
surgery a few years ago,

1161
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,514
so Miriam thought that I'd be

1162
00:46:46,514 --> 00:46:48,187
the perfect candidate for--
- Phone, Diane.

1163
00:46:48,187 --> 00:46:50,104
The phone!
- I'm coming.

1164
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,353
Hello.

1165
00:46:53,312 --> 00:46:54,262
Yes, this is Diane.

1166
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:57,937
Oh hi, yes, of course.

1167
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:06,991
Of course, I understand, but how long

1168
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:07,824
do you really think you're gonna be

1169
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:09,492
able to keep this a secret?

1170
00:47:09,492 --> 00:47:10,410
Can you hold on?

1171
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,250
I think I'm losing a guest.

1172
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,410
- No you're not.

1173
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,170
Open the prize closet.

1174
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,300
Offer her an extra day
or two and just see.

1175
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,187
If that doesn't work,
throw some money at her,

1176
00:47:18,187 --> 00:47:20,340
but don't even think about telling

1177
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,313
me you've lost her.

1178
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:23,323
Myra.

1179
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,533
We need to talk.

1180
00:47:29,533 --> 00:47:34,533
- Hi, um, you know, I'm thinking that

1181
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,263
it's probably just stage fright.

1182
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,620
What could I possibly do to make this

1183
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,903
a little easier for you?

1184
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,110
- I want to hear right on, brother.

1185
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:45,240
Tell it like it is, girl.

1186
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,560
You better start talkin' to my hand,

1187
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,173
'cause my face just stopped listenin'

1188
00:47:48,173 --> 00:47:49,966
a half an hour ago to what
you all started sayin'.

1189
00:47:49,966 --> 00:47:50,799
(audience laughing)
Okay?

1190
00:47:50,799 --> 00:47:51,632
I want everyone to say hello

1191
00:47:51,632 --> 00:47:52,681
to my main man Keith.

1192
00:47:52,681 --> 00:47:54,033
- [Audience] Hi, Keith.

1193
00:47:54,033 --> 00:47:56,200
- All right, Keith is gonna help you out.

1194
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,690
So every time you see
my man Keith do this,

1195
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:01,231
we expect to hear from you.

1196
00:48:01,231 --> 00:48:04,231
(audience cheering)

1197
00:48:08,935 --> 00:48:11,010
Ladies and gentlemen of New York City,

1198
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:12,880
without further ado, put your hands

1199
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,880
and feet together for a warm welcome

1200
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,340
to the one, the only, the dashing,

1201
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,930
the daring, compassionate and caring

1202
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:20,204
all-around guru of television talk show

1203
00:48:20,204 --> 00:48:22,296
Howard Grant!

1204
00:48:22,296 --> 00:48:27,296
(upbeat music)
(audience applauding)

1205
00:48:38,406 --> 00:48:40,910
- Camera two, give me a waister on Howard.

1206
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:42,040
Take two.

1207
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,110
Ready one.

1208
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,260
Take one.

1209
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,093
Key Lana.

1210
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,167
32, take two.

1211
00:48:50,417 --> 00:48:52,380
Camera three, tighten up on Howard.

1212
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,213
Tighten up.

1213
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,200
Ready one, take one.

1214
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,870
- A week doesn't go by without one

1215
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:59,940
of our competitors staging
a show just like this.

1216
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,310
- We've got a few new wrinkles.

1217
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:02,413
Haven't we, Diane?

1218
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:06,303
- I better go prep the next guest.

1219
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:09,528
(audience applauding)

1220
00:49:09,528 --> 00:49:12,350
- I bloomed kinda young, you know.

1221
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:14,320
And the guys, I mean, they were

1222
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,380
always like at me, and you know,

1223
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,910
I figured, you know,
when opportunity knocked.

1224
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:21,613
I mean, (laughs) hello, why not?

1225
00:49:22,567 --> 00:49:25,734
(audience applauding)

1226
00:49:27,528 --> 00:49:28,361
- Why not?

1227
00:49:29,241 --> 00:49:30,739
- Camera three's out of focus.

1228
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:32,210
That operator's history.

1229
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,610
I want him off the stage now!
- Lana, even without knowing

1230
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:36,450
your husband, I think we can safely assume

1231
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:39,040
he's a very understanding fellow.

1232
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,453
Let's say hi to Pete.

1233
00:49:41,628 --> 00:49:44,795
(audience applauding)

1234
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:48,943
Thanks for joining us, Pete.

1235
00:49:48,943 --> 00:49:50,501
- [Man In Audience] You're a lucky guy!

1236
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:53,930
- Now, before we go any
further, I have to ask.

1237
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,970
It doesn't bother you seeing your wife

1238
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:58,340
take off her clothes in
front of all those other men?

1239
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:59,610
- She can go right ahead.

1240
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:01,114
They can slobber all they want.

1241
00:50:01,114 --> 00:50:04,640
(audience laughs)

1242
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,980
'Cause they're just a bunch of hogs

1243
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,256
gatherin' at the trough.

1244
00:50:07,256 --> 00:50:10,785
(audience applauding)

1245
00:50:10,785 --> 00:50:12,360
I can tell you, this ole boy's the only

1246
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,301
one that ever gets the slop.

1247
00:50:14,301 --> 00:50:15,830
Ain't that right, honey?

1248
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:17,948
(audience applauding)

1249
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:19,598
- And I thought romance was dead.

1250
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,157
- Listen to this.

1251
00:50:24,157 --> 00:50:25,180
Tell him how we met, go on.

1252
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,010
- Well, I guess you could say that Lana

1253
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:28,822
here was my birthday present.

1254
00:50:28,822 --> 00:50:29,655
- Ta-da.

1255
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,490
- [Pete] A bunch of boys
got together, you know.

1256
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:35,653
- They hired her to strip at your party?

1257
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,050
- Actually, it was a little bit more

1258
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:40,454
intimate than that.

1259
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,762
(audience oohs)

1260
00:50:41,762 --> 00:50:44,262
(Pete laughs)

1261
00:50:45,791 --> 00:50:48,212
- BJ. (laughs)

1262
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,990
- There's an idea for a show,

1263
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:51,910
housewives who hook.

1264
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:53,723
Or have we already done that one?

1265
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:55,930
- Intimate.

1266
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:56,763
Yes.

1267
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:00,960
- I've got something to say to Lana.

1268
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,921
How can you let him treat
you like a piece of meat?

1269
00:51:03,921 --> 00:51:05,730
- [Audience] Aww!

1270
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,315
- You're just jealous!

1271
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:08,197
I'll tell her.

1272
00:51:08,197 --> 00:51:09,750
- And you, Howard.

1273
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:12,500
I used to admire you, but
now you're like all the rest.

1274
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,150
You demean women.

1275
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:16,320
You demean the human race!

1276
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,263
- Damn, mark that comment
right after piece of meat.

1277
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,426
We'll cut the rest in post.
- Lana's husband is completely

1278
00:51:22,426 --> 00:51:23,640
comfortable with her line of work,

1279
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,950
but some of our guests perform

1280
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:28,742
without their husband's knowledge.

1281
00:51:28,742 --> 00:51:31,351
(audience groans)

1282
00:51:31,351 --> 00:51:33,201
- I just know how he's gonna take it.

1283
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:37,403
- Um, well, just, you know, relax.

1284
00:51:38,413 --> 00:51:41,814
I'm sure it'll be fine
once you get out there.

1285
00:51:41,814 --> 00:51:42,767
- Okay.

1286
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:45,110
- When we come back,
we'll answer the question

1287
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:48,190
what happens when the unsuspecting hubby

1288
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:51,904
discovers that the little
woman moonlights as a stripper?

1289
00:51:51,904 --> 00:51:52,806
- [Director] 31.

1290
00:51:52,806 --> 00:51:54,845
(audience applauding)
- When we come back.

1291
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:57,595
(dramatic music)

1292
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,590
Let's give a nice hello to Shelley.

1293
00:52:04,471 --> 00:52:07,638
(audience applauding)

1294
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,616
- You're gonna be great.

1295
00:52:13,616 --> 00:52:18,616
Go on, good luck.

1296
00:52:27,529 --> 00:52:29,630
- Hello, Shelley, welcome
to the Howard Grant Show.

1297
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:32,243
Now, you're a secretary?

1298
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,743
- During the day.

1299
00:52:35,743 --> 00:52:38,190
(audience laughing)

1300
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:39,090
- I'm curious.

1301
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,650
How did you go from taking dictation

1302
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:43,930
in an office to taking
your clothes off in a bar?

1303
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:47,930
- Well, it was my
surgery, really. (laughs)

1304
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:50,000
Well, you know, it's like
when you get a new car.

1305
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,670
It don't mean much if you can't,

1306
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:53,290
you know, show it off a little bit.

1307
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:56,020
So when I got my new boobs,

1308
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:59,643
I just sorta wanted to share them.

1309
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,643
(audience cheering)

1310
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:05,445
- I've never been on TV before.

1311
00:53:05,445 --> 00:53:06,362
- Shh, shh.

1312
00:53:08,095 --> 00:53:10,540
- But your husband doesn't know.

1313
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,833
- About my boobs?

1314
00:53:11,833 --> 00:53:16,180
(audience laughing)
- No, about your stripping.

1315
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,370
- Oh.

1316
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:18,376
No.

1317
00:53:18,376 --> 00:53:19,540
(throat clears) No.

1318
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:22,400
I wasn't sure how he was gonna take it.

1319
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,507
- Shall we find out?

1320
00:53:23,507 --> 00:53:24,893
- [Audience] Yes!

1321
00:53:24,893 --> 00:53:27,146
(audience applauding)

1322
00:53:27,146 --> 00:53:31,760
- I've got all my friends
and relatives watching.

1323
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,680
- We've had Shelley's husband in isolation

1324
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,870
backstage, but now we're gonna ask

1325
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:36,060
him to join us.

1326
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,390
Ladies and gentlemen, let's give Bill

1327
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:39,254
a big round of applause.

1328
00:53:39,254 --> 00:53:41,527
(audience applauding)

1329
00:53:41,527 --> 00:53:43,027
- You'll be great.

1330
00:53:43,997 --> 00:53:44,830
Good luck.

1331
00:53:48,488 --> 00:53:49,900
- [Director] See Bill.

1332
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,570
Ready two, take two.

1333
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:52,403
- Ambush.

1334
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:53,374
Ambush.

1335
00:53:53,374 --> 00:53:56,080
There's outlaws up that canyon, cowboy.

1336
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:56,970
- That's it, Tex.

1337
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:58,363
You're outta here.

1338
00:53:58,363 --> 00:54:00,111
- [Howard] Welcome to
the Howard Grant Show.

1339
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:00,944
- [Jeffrey] Move!

1340
00:54:00,944 --> 00:54:01,977
- [Howard] We've asked
you here because your wife

1341
00:54:01,977 --> 00:54:04,630
has a secret she wants to share with you.

1342
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,428
Any idea what it is?

1343
00:54:06,428 --> 00:54:08,393
- See ya, Jer.

1344
00:54:08,393 --> 00:54:09,226
- I don't know.

1345
00:54:10,096 --> 00:54:11,450
(audience chuckles)

1346
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:12,440
- I'll give you a hint.

1347
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,430
Shelley's been moonlighting lately

1348
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:16,487
to bring in a little
extra cash, hasn't she?

1349
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:18,070
(audience laughing)

1350
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:20,940
- Yeah, she's been waitressing.

1351
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,560
The pays good.

1352
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,503
It pays good too.

1353
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,740
- That's what she's been telling you.

1354
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:30,210
How would you like to know what she's

1355
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:31,143
really been doing?

1356
00:54:34,937 --> 00:54:36,354
- I don't get it.

1357
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,621
- Why don't we let her show you.

1358
00:54:38,621 --> 00:54:39,638
Maestro!

1359
00:54:39,638 --> 00:54:40,743
(audience applauding)

1360
00:54:40,743 --> 00:54:43,160
(sexy music)

1361
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:44,191
- What is he doing?

1362
00:55:44,191 --> 00:55:45,383
He's not supposed to do that.

1363
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,333
- That's enough.

1364
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:49,959
(Shelley screams)

1365
00:55:49,959 --> 00:55:51,621
- [Howard] Come on, wait a second.

1366
00:55:51,621 --> 00:55:54,812
(punch slamming)

1367
00:55:54,812 --> 00:55:56,081
- Oh God, get Howard out of this!

1368
00:55:56,081 --> 00:55:56,914
Jimmy!

1369
00:55:56,914 --> 00:55:58,303
- Oh, this is great!
- Yes!

1370
00:55:58,303 --> 00:56:00,203
- This is what talk's all about.

1371
00:56:04,175 --> 00:56:05,008
- [Director] If Howard leaves that stage,

1372
00:56:05,008 --> 00:56:06,445
I will personally murder him!

1373
00:56:06,445 --> 00:56:07,959
- Uh, I told you we had some new wrinkles.

1374
00:56:07,959 --> 00:56:08,792
- Come on!

1375
00:56:12,879 --> 00:56:14,280
- [Director] Camera four,
move right in there.

1376
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,113
Get Howard.

1377
00:56:18,164 --> 00:56:18,997
- [Security Guard] Let's go.

1378
00:56:18,997 --> 00:56:20,050
Right now, right now!

1379
00:56:25,312 --> 00:56:26,145
- Sit down.

1380
00:56:26,145 --> 00:56:27,312
I'm all right.

1381
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:31,890
- [Jimmy] Hey.

1382
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:33,917
So what are you gonna do with the money?

1383
00:56:33,917 --> 00:56:35,160
- What money?

1384
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:35,993
- Didn't you know?

1385
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:38,393
There's a $500 bonus for
any on-the-air fights.

1386
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,790
Keep up the good work and even Sadie'll

1387
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:42,390
have to start watching her back.

1388
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:44,264
Hi.

1389
00:56:44,264 --> 00:56:45,097
(Sadie chuckles)

1390
00:56:45,097 --> 00:56:45,940
Terrific show.

1391
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,030
- Mm.

1392
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:48,980
- [Jimmy] Well, no rest for the wicked.

1393
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,333
- Congratulations.

1394
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,633
You won Madden's heart.

1395
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,973
I know it's a very small
prize, but it matters.

1396
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:11,417
It's gotten to you, hasn't it?

1397
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:14,923
You feel what, unclean?

1398
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,600
- This just isn't what I came here to do.

1399
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,220
- Mm, you know what your trouble is,

1400
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,320
you're an idealist.

1401
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,620
You think you can do shows to improve

1402
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:28,460
people's lives, but you can't.

1403
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:32,977
There's no audience for it.

1404
00:57:32,977 --> 00:57:35,513
Everything in talk is entertainment.

1405
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,783
Everybody in the business is a whore.

1406
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,823
But there is a bright side.

1407
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,387
We're highly paid whores.

1408
00:57:47,282 --> 00:57:49,699
(slow music)

1409
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:07,582
(machine beeps)

1410
00:58:07,582 --> 00:58:08,929
- [Diane's Mother] Diane, it's Mom.

1411
00:58:08,929 --> 00:58:11,660
I just wanted to remind
you about Daddy's birthday.

1412
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:14,520
Now, the party's at two,
so why don't you call

1413
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,160
and surprise him when
everyone's here, okay?

1414
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,210
We love you.

1415
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:19,043
Bye.

1416
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:21,347
(machine beeps)

1417
00:58:21,347 --> 00:58:23,014
- Diane, it's Jenny.

1418
00:58:24,673 --> 00:58:26,006
Nothing special.

1419
00:58:27,282 --> 00:58:30,910
I guess (sighs) I just felt like talking.

1420
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:32,360
I'll catch you at the office.

1421
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,907
(hand knocking)

1422
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,396
- Who is it?

1423
00:58:39,396 --> 00:58:41,717
- [Jimmy] Diane, it's Jimmy.

1424
00:58:41,717 --> 00:58:42,905
- Jimmy?

1425
00:58:42,905 --> 00:58:46,144
(gentle music)

1426
00:58:46,144 --> 00:58:46,977
- Hi.

1427
00:58:48,221 --> 00:58:49,840
I was just leaving the studio when--

1428
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,798
- It's Kelly.

1429
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:51,965
She's in jail.

1430
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:58,840
- It was right after
we left the apartment.

1431
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:01,690
Dwayne, he sees him coming,

1432
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:04,823
and he fades away like he was never there.

1433
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:10,120
I figured it was the
usual roundup, you know?

1434
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,790
In and out in a couple of hours,

1435
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:14,620
but no, it was that cabbie.

1436
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,173
Oh God.

1437
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,550
- Could we get some help?

1438
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:19,850
Could somebody help us, please!

1439
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,750
- You get me out of here!

1440
00:59:23,436 --> 00:59:24,980
- I can't.

1441
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,680
It took me all day just to get in.

1442
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:30,110
Are you gonna be okay?

1443
00:59:30,944 --> 00:59:32,563
- Yeah, I feel great.

1444
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:36,220
- I'm very sorry.

1445
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:37,170
I mean, I really wish there was

1446
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:38,693
something I could do for you.

1447
00:59:39,602 --> 00:59:40,435
- There is.

1448
00:59:40,435 --> 00:59:41,930
You could get me out of here.

1449
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:44,370
Mom said you could get me out.

1450
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:45,483
- I can't get you out.

1451
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,380
Kelly, if she said that,

1452
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,453
she just, she misunderstood, all right?

1453
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:52,670
I told her that I could propose

1454
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:53,823
a satellite remote.

1455
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:55,733
- A what?

1456
00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:01,240
- Well, I could interview you live in jail

1457
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,170
while talking to your family on the show.

1458
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:05,670
But then, you know, we could go in front

1459
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:07,380
of the judge and offer to put you

1460
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,790
in a treatment program
maybe instead of jail time.

1461
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:11,500
- Yeah, but what am I supposed

1462
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,933
to do in the meantime?

1463
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:17,080
Ow. (crying)
- I don't know.

1464
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:17,970
Hang in there, I guess.

1465
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:19,470
I don't know what to tell you.

1466
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:28,983
- This treatment program,
they got methadone?

1467
01:00:30,882 --> 01:00:31,850
- I don't know.

1468
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:32,683
- [Man] Forget it.

1469
01:00:32,683 --> 01:00:35,147
I'm not gonna let you people
play God with this girl.

1470
01:00:35,147 --> 01:00:36,820
- [Diane] But we're
not trying to play God.

1471
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:38,290
- [Man] I'm due in court.

1472
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:39,900
- Please just hear me out.

1473
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,320
- Look, you want to help this girl?

1474
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,153
- Yes.

1475
01:00:42,153 --> 01:00:44,620
- Then don't humiliate
her by putting her on TV.

1476
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:47,390
Let nature and the legal
system take their course.

1477
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,140
Let her go cold turkey.

1478
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,190
It'll give her something to think about

1479
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:52,360
next time she thinks about
sticking a needle in her arm.

1480
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,193
- That's just it.

1481
01:00:53,193 --> 01:00:54,870
We want to put her in a treatment program.

1482
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:57,290
- Hey look, do I look like
some kind of idiot here?

1483
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:58,970
In a couple of days, the assistant DA's

1484
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:00,360
gonna show up and he's gonna say Jack,

1485
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,200
what can we do?

1486
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,084
And I'm gonna say Mike,
the jails are overcrowded,

1487
01:01:04,084 --> 01:01:06,023
and the only person this girl's ever hurt

1488
01:01:06,023 --> 01:01:07,630
is herself, so why don't we do

1489
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:09,210
everybody a favor, and we'll put her

1490
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:11,190
into a treatment program in lieu of jail.

1491
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:12,380
Great idea, he says.

1492
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:13,600
Nice talkin' to ya.

1493
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,352
By then, she'll have gone cold turkey.

1494
01:01:16,352 --> 01:01:18,230
She'll be off the stuff.

1495
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:20,890
She'll go in clean, maybe even have some

1496
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:22,350
chance of going all the way.

1497
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:24,950
And she won't have the
memory of going on TV

1498
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,963
and rubbing her face in her dirt!

1499
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,400
What are you gonna call this anyway?

1500
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,713
I was a teenage junkie?

1501
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,550
- [Diane] The satellite
remotes, it's not happening.

1502
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:43,383
- [Sadie] Why not?

1503
01:01:43,383 --> 01:01:44,770
- Well, her public defender's against it

1504
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:46,060
and so's the jail.

1505
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,160
- Bail her out.

1506
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,120
- What?

1507
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:48,953
Wait a minute, Sadie.

1508
01:01:48,953 --> 01:01:50,640
Wouldn't that be crossing
some sort of a line?

1509
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,043
- You're going soft on me?

1510
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:55,130
You crossed a line when
you paid off her pimp.

1511
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:58,440
You crossed another line when
you witnessed that carjacking.

1512
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,240
Now you're worried
about fronting her bail?

1513
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,290
- I know, it's just that I don't know--

1514
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:05,410
- Diane, if you look
at it with a clear head

1515
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:06,620
you'll see that there really aren't

1516
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:08,820
any lines, just frontiers.

1517
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:10,480
You want to succeed in
talk, you gotta keep

1518
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,960
pushing them back.

1519
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,100
Bail her out.

1520
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,603
- Okay, okay.

1521
01:02:14,603 --> 01:02:15,910
It's just that the court's closed now.

1522
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:17,340
- Well then tomorrow.

1523
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:18,830
And Diane?

1524
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:19,830
- Yeah?

1525
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:21,570
- You haven't forgotten about the station

1526
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:23,057
manager's party, have you?

1527
01:02:26,631 --> 01:02:30,024
(dial tone humming)

1528
01:02:30,024 --> 01:02:32,017
- I've always prided
myself on being in touch,

1529
01:02:32,017 --> 01:02:33,989
but the landscape of talk has changed,

1530
01:02:33,989 --> 01:02:35,930
and you can bet the Howard
Grant Show's gonna change too.

1531
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:38,190
- [Sadie] Regarding Howard's
longevity and the fact

1532
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,420
that his ratings are rising.

1533
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,408
- I'm telling you, Sadie, the demographics

1534
01:02:41,408 --> 01:02:43,253
get younger every day.

1535
01:02:43,253 --> 01:02:44,770
They don't want Howard.

1536
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:47,493
They want Ricki or Howard's son.

1537
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,210
- Yes, well you know what
you have to understand

1538
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:54,000
is that our owners are farmers.

1539
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,090
- Farmers.

1540
01:02:55,090 --> 01:02:58,440
- Big farmers, but they're
still good old boys

1541
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,260
with good old fashioned
values, and I got the--

1542
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:01,960
- Tell me those old fashioned values

1543
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:05,000
do include appreciation of
the bottom line, don't they?

1544
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,460
- Yes, sir, they do.

1545
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:07,810
And that's my second point.

1546
01:03:09,068 --> 01:03:11,150
Our big sponsors are getting cold feet

1547
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:11,983
and starting to pull out.

1548
01:03:11,983 --> 01:03:13,890
- Uh huh, and for every
one that pulls out,

1549
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:16,958
there are two or three
others standing in line

1550
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:19,150
waiting to step in.

1551
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:21,070
- Everything's always
threatening to fall apart,

1552
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:22,360
but, at the last minute, you manage

1553
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,180
to pull it out of the toilet.

1554
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:25,013
It's a constant rush.

1555
01:03:25,013 --> 01:03:27,400
I can't wait until I become a producer.

1556
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,277
The critics can say what they want,

1557
01:03:28,277 --> 01:03:31,540
but we're dealing with stuff
the average Joe cares about.

1558
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:32,720
Bosnia, the bond market?

1559
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,250
They don't care about that stuff.

1560
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:36,200
They care about the
stuff that impacts them,

1561
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,560
the stuff talk deals with.

1562
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,393
- Right.

1563
01:03:39,393 --> 01:03:40,226
- And Sadie, woo.

1564
01:03:40,226 --> 01:03:41,800
She's tough, but you know what?

1565
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,170
You gotta be.

1566
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:44,003
And she cares too.

1567
01:03:44,003 --> 01:03:45,850
When she saw that thing
upset Jenny the other day,

1568
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:46,980
she took care of her.

1569
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,280
I tell ya, I'm right where I want to be.

1570
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,080
Right in the thick of it.

1571
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:50,930
- Jimmy, I'm sorry can you excuse me?

1572
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:52,987
I just want to go talk
to Jenny for a minute.

1573
01:03:52,987 --> 01:03:53,820
- Sure.

1574
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,083
- Jenny!

1575
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,249
- [Man] Whoa, what's the matter with you?

1576
01:03:58,249 --> 01:03:59,667
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

1577
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:01,928
- Oh, don't be, I'm grateful.

1578
01:04:01,928 --> 01:04:03,090
- You're grateful?

1579
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,860
- Yes, for the opportunity to meet

1580
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:07,260
such a lovely young woman.

1581
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,610
I'm Mark Holston.

1582
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:09,530
- Diane Shepherd.

1583
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:11,030
- Oh, you're Diane.

1584
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:13,660
Oh, I understand Sadie
has great hopes for you.

1585
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:15,100
- Oh, no, I mean, I'm new.

1586
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,640
I'm just sort of feeling
my way through, you know.

1587
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,460
- Well, we're soul mates then.

1588
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,540
- Oh no, I mean, you're a lawyer,

1589
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,400
and you don't go through...

1590
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,040
Oh.

1591
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,760
- Diane, have you been spying on me?

1592
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:27,670
- No, no.

1593
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:28,670
I just.

1594
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:30,100
Well, of course, I know who you are.

1595
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:32,516
I mean, I know about the
case that you won, and--

1596
01:04:32,516 --> 01:04:33,495
- And?

1597
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:36,540
- (laugh) I just, I know
about you and Sadie.

1598
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,441
- Ah, then you have been spying on me.

1599
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:39,274
- No.

1600
01:04:39,274 --> 01:04:40,107
No, no.

1601
01:04:40,107 --> 01:04:40,940
- It's okay.

1602
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:43,597
Because we're soul mates, I forgive you.

1603
01:04:43,597 --> 01:04:47,470
You know, I think you and I
should get together for dinner.

1604
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:48,960
Then you could tell me all about yourself.

1605
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,283
I could tell you all about myself,

1606
01:04:50,283 --> 01:04:52,848
and then you could give
up your career as a spy.

1607
01:04:52,848 --> 01:04:54,423
- (laughs) That's sweet.

1608
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:56,692
I don't think Sadie would like that.

1609
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:57,920
- Well, Sadie doesn't have to know.

1610
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,660
- Oh now, I couldn't do that, Mark.

1611
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:00,493
- Oh sure you could.

1612
01:05:00,493 --> 01:05:02,150
You know, people do it all the time.

1613
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:03,430
- Mark.

1614
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:04,840
- Sadie.

1615
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:05,740
- We have to talk.

1616
01:05:07,606 --> 01:05:08,439
- You'll excuse me, won't you?

1617
01:05:08,439 --> 01:05:09,489
- Oh yes.

1618
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:10,720
(glass tinkling)

1619
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,644
- Ladies and gentlemen.

1620
01:05:12,644 --> 01:05:13,477
Thank you, Jenny.

1621
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,640
We've got a little program planned,

1622
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,300
so if you'll gather around the monitors,

1623
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,200
we'll get started.

1624
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,190
Maestro, if you will.

1625
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:25,695
- Where's Sadie?

1626
01:05:25,695 --> 01:05:27,205
- Oh, I, I'm not sure.

1627
01:05:27,205 --> 01:05:28,300
I just saw her--
- Find her.

1628
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,720
She's up right after the clips.

1629
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,190
- [Announcer] For 15
years now, America has

1630
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:34,770
trusted Howard Grant to bring it the most

1631
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:36,470
compelling programming in talk TV.

1632
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:39,713
Whether the issue is
race or relationships,

1633
01:05:39,713 --> 01:05:41,941
the politics of this nation.

1634
01:05:41,941 --> 01:05:42,774
- [Sadie] You can't talk
yourself out of this.

1635
01:05:42,774 --> 01:05:44,280
- Sadie?

1636
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,953
- [Mark] Don't you think
you're overreacting?

1637
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,130
- [Sadie] I had to stand there and listen

1638
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:51,070
politely while that tramp bragged

1639
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:52,170
about sleeping with you.

1640
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:53,410
- [Mark] It meant nothing, all right.

1641
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:54,743
It was just sex.

1642
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,730
- [Sadie] How many of
these sweet little nothings

1643
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:58,660
have you got, Mark?

1644
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,300
A station manager here,
a legal secretary there.

1645
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,050
- [Mark] Sadie, I'm telling you.

1646
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:04,130
- [Sadie] No!

1647
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:06,150
I am telling you, Mark.

1648
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:08,833
You can forget about us,
if there ever was an us.

1649
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:12,410
And you can forget about the show too,

1650
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:14,943
Because as of this
moment, you are history!

1651
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:20,070
- [Mark] You know, you
were always history, Sadie,

1652
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:23,658
old, dusty and dull.

1653
01:06:23,658 --> 01:06:25,085
- [Announcer] Have watched
their ratings plummet

1654
01:06:25,085 --> 01:06:26,985
in the course of the last few years.

1655
01:06:26,985 --> 01:06:29,587
Howard's ratings among women 18 to 49

1656
01:06:29,587 --> 01:06:33,549
have actually risen during
the same period of time.

1657
01:06:33,549 --> 01:06:35,934
The Howard Grant Show, it simply doesn't

1658
01:06:35,934 --> 01:06:37,394
get any better than this.

1659
01:06:37,394 --> 01:06:38,227
- All right, everyone, sit down.

1660
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:39,670
I'm all right.

1661
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:43,018
- [Announcer] Howard Grant,
all right with America.

1662
01:06:43,018 --> 01:06:46,518
(people clapping)
- Yeah!

1663
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:51,380
- She was safe in jail, from a pimp,

1664
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,450
from a habit, from herself.

1665
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:55,140
Now you just spent $8,000
to put her at risk again!

1666
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:56,150
- No, no, no, no, I promise you,

1667
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:57,150
she's gonna be safe with us.

1668
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:57,983
We're gonna place her in a--

1669
01:06:57,983 --> 01:06:58,816
- You're gonna place her back

1670
01:06:58,816 --> 01:07:00,250
in the same hell she just left!

1671
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,450
Now, that is not bail money!

1672
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,493
That is blood money!

1673
01:07:05,113 --> 01:07:07,696
(gentle music)

1674
01:07:30,071 --> 01:07:31,073
- What's this?

1675
01:07:31,073 --> 01:07:32,283
- It's my apartment.

1676
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:34,323
The show usually provides the guests

1677
01:07:34,323 --> 01:07:35,250
with a hotel room.

1678
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:37,110
I thought you'd be more comfortable here.

1679
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:38,350
- What's the matter, you figure I'm gonna

1680
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:39,870
run off or somethin'?

1681
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:41,500
- [Diane] Look, they told me
to keep an eye on you, okay?

1682
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,680
I could've put you in a hotel room

1683
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,470
with a body guard, all right?

1684
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:45,303
- Whatever.

1685
01:07:52,407 --> 01:07:53,240
Wow.

1686
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:56,783
Nice place.

1687
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:59,720
- Oh, um, thanks.

1688
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,503
It's just a sublet.

1689
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:06,470
Um, listen, make yourself at home, okay?

1690
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:08,433
I just, um, I gotta make a phone call.

1691
01:08:18,397 --> 01:08:20,890
Happy birthday, Daddy!

1692
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:21,870
Oh yeah, I know.

1693
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:23,513
I'm sorry I missed your party.

1694
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:26,263
He what?

1695
01:08:27,174 --> 01:08:29,433
(laughs) I don't believe it.

1696
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:31,530
In front of everybody?

1697
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:33,770
I can't believe I missed that.

1698
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:35,533
Oh, that is so embarrassing!

1699
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:40,810
Um, you know what?

1700
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:43,000
I have someone here, so I just called

1701
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,147
to wish you a happy birthday and tell you

1702
01:08:44,147 --> 01:08:46,053
that I love you very, very much.

1703
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,300
Yes.

1704
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:49,483
Yes, I'll be careful.

1705
01:08:52,006 --> 01:08:53,582
I love you too.

1706
01:08:53,582 --> 01:08:54,415
Bye.

1707
01:08:56,373 --> 01:08:58,423
- He sounds like a nice guy or something.

1708
01:08:59,388 --> 01:09:01,340
- Yeah, yeah, he is.

1709
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,990
- Yeah well, I don't believe in nice guys.

1710
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:07,307
I never met one that
didn't want somethin'.

1711
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:11,560
- You know, not everybody
is out for themselves.

1712
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,940
- Yeah?

1713
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,563
Yeah well, what about you, huh?

1714
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:19,990
You're being all nicey
nice, but it isn't real.

1715
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:21,423
You just want something.

1716
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:25,220
You're just like, like those johns

1717
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:26,910
that tell me how pretty I am

1718
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:28,010
and wonder what a girl like me

1719
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:29,170
is doing out on the street.

1720
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:30,520
- No.

1721
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:33,040
I mean, yeah, I want you on the show,

1722
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,563
but I also care about what happens to you.

1723
01:09:34,563 --> 01:09:38,010
- N-n-n-n-no, everybody's
the same, all right?

1724
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:40,100
I go on the show tomorrow.

1725
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,510
I do my little act.

1726
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,290
Your boss pats you on the back,

1727
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:45,830
and it's on to the next one.

1728
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:47,440
Goodbye, Kelly.

1729
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:48,863
Hello, whoever.

1730
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:56,080
Have you got something to eat?

1731
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:00,160
I'm starvin'.

1732
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,300
I mean, it's always like
this when I come down.

1733
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,800
I can never get enough to eat.

1734
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:07,170
- So you've been clean before?

1735
01:10:08,033 --> 01:10:08,866
- Um hmm.

1736
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,803
When I was pregnant, I went cold turkey.

1737
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,863
I didn't want my kid born a junkie.

1738
01:10:19,663 --> 01:10:20,963
Have you seen her picture?

1739
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:24,750
- Yeah.

1740
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:26,063
- She's cute, isn't she?

1741
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:28,513
- She's beautiful.

1742
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:37,323
So um, why,

1743
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:41,023
why did you go back to the drugs?

1744
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,733
I mean, how could you let
your little girl go like that?

1745
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,370
- What was I gonna do for her?

1746
01:10:52,278 --> 01:10:54,695
You know me a junkie, no job,

1747
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,303
no education, no home.

1748
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,347
What was I gonna do for her?

1749
01:11:06,657 --> 01:11:08,530
- It doesn't have to be that way.

1750
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:09,980
- Yes, it does.

1751
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:11,586
It does have to be that way.

1752
01:11:11,586 --> 01:11:13,007
- No, no, it doesn't.

1753
01:11:13,007 --> 01:11:15,030
You could help yourself.

1754
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:16,880
You could go to a treatment program.

1755
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:17,930
You could go to school--

1756
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:18,763
- Yeah, what do you know about it?

1757
01:11:18,763 --> 01:11:21,533
You've never had that needle in your arm.

1758
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,203
We're sitting here talking about my kid,

1759
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:28,470
my child, all right.

1760
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:31,087
And what am I thinking about?

1761
01:11:31,087 --> 01:11:33,700
I'm thinking about that needle.

1762
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:36,380
I'm thinking about how just a spoonful

1763
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:39,113
of that white sugar will
make all of this go away.

1764
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,953
See, I don't want to care.

1765
01:11:43,957 --> 01:11:45,803
I don't want to care about anything.

1766
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:47,833
- But you do.

1767
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:53,363
I know that you do.

1768
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:00,314
So do I.

1769
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,370
- Hello.

1770
01:12:09,370 --> 01:12:10,770
Have you suffered brain death?

1771
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:11,760
Of course we're going ahead.

1772
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,980
- Sadie, I am not suggesting
that we shouldn't.

1773
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:16,540
I'm just saying that she seems
a little fragile, you know.

1774
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,800
I'm concerned about what could
happen to her afterwards.

1775
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,470
- She's going into a rehab program.

1776
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:22,340
- Or she could end up back on the streets.

1777
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:25,180
- Uh, that's exactly where you found her.

1778
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:27,010
Look, the bottom line, I don't care

1779
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:29,850
what happens to her
and neither should you.

1780
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:32,380
You book 'em, interview
'em, get rid of 'em.

1781
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,523
Bing, bang, boom.

1782
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:42,870
- Jenny?

1783
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:44,425
Jenny, hi.

1784
01:12:44,425 --> 01:12:46,290
Wait a second, I, I've been really

1785
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:48,210
worried about you, you know?

1786
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:49,160
- [Jenny] I'm fine.

1787
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:50,953
- Oh, I.

1788
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:54,560
I just, I've been feeling like
I let you down the other day.

1789
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,360
- I'm fine, really.

1790
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:57,193
Sadie was right.

1791
01:12:57,193 --> 01:12:59,170
It was bound to happen anyways.

1792
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:02,833
It was just a mistake to
get so emotionally involved.

1793
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:05,793
I gotta run.

1794
01:13:05,793 --> 01:13:06,980
I'll catch you later, okay?

1795
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:12,037
- So I said to him, "Ted
don't you have any pride?

1796
01:13:12,037 --> 01:13:15,087
"How could you ride my
shirt tails like this?"

1797
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,520
- [Sadie] Where's the kid, Diane?

1798
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,850
I don't see any sign of her here.

1799
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:24,690
- Right, I told you,
the record was sealed.

1800
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:26,940
- And I told you there
was a way around that.

1801
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:29,300
- Look, Sadie, I thought about it,

1802
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:30,230
and I really don't think we should

1803
01:13:30,230 --> 01:13:32,250
subject Kelly to that kind of emotional--

1804
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:34,960
- I have already briefed
Howard on this one.

1805
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,210
Could we read through it?

1806
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:41,460
- As many of you know, I have for years

1807
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:44,310
tried to focus attention on the plague

1808
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:47,143
of drugs devastating
the youth of our nation.

1809
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,293
It is a plague with many symptoms:

1810
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:54,153
AIDS, violent crime, prostitution.

1811
01:13:54,153 --> 01:13:56,800
- Pick up the pace, Howard, and give me

1812
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,083
a pause before prostitution.

1813
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:05,290
- As many of you know, I have for years

1814
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:06,900
tried to focus attention on the plague

1815
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,573
of drugs devastating the youth.

1816
01:14:09,435 --> 01:14:11,045
- [Announcer] The Howard Grant Show!

1817
01:14:11,045 --> 01:14:13,411
(audience applauding)

1818
01:14:13,411 --> 01:14:14,970
- Hi.

1819
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:15,803
You all right?

1820
01:14:15,803 --> 01:14:18,074
- Got anymore of those candy bars?

1821
01:14:18,074 --> 01:14:20,124
- (laughs) All right, I'll talk to Jimmy.

1822
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:24,420
You sure you're up to this?

1823
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,764
- What kind of question is that?

1824
01:14:26,764 --> 01:14:28,934
Like I'm gonna back out now?

1825
01:14:28,934 --> 01:14:29,767
And then what?

1826
01:14:29,767 --> 01:14:30,963
Go back to jail?

1827
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:33,750
I'm cool.

1828
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:36,263
You just take care of those
candy bars, all right?

1829
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,250
- As many of you know,
I have for years now

1830
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,790
tried to focus attention on the plague

1831
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:49,000
of drugs devastating
the youth of our nation.

1832
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,943
It is a plague with many symptoms:

1833
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:57,590
AIDS, violent crime, prostitution.

1834
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:02,200
In fact, a shockingly high percentage

1835
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,340
of the prostitutes on our streets

1836
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:06,193
are there simply to feed their habit.

1837
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:09,930
Not long ago, the mother of one such girl

1838
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:10,830
wrote me a letter.

1839
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:15,743
Dear Howard,

1840
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:20,670
I am writing to you because I don't know

1841
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:22,250
where else to turn.

1842
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:27,250
- Every day, my daughter breaks my heart.

1843
01:15:29,503 --> 01:15:32,840
She's only 19, but her
life is already over.

1844
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:36,500
She is a drug-addicted prostitute

1845
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,400
and the mother of a two-year-old girl.

1846
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,230
- [Howard] Like so many
of our young people today,

1847
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:44,390
Kelly started out with
the world all before her.

1848
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:46,690
Then heroine changed her life.

1849
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:48,640
Did you shoot up before this interview?

1850
01:15:49,521 --> 01:15:51,250
- [Kelly] Good stuff, actually.

1851
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,760
- [Howard] Why, Kelly?

1852
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,073
- [Kelly] Look around you.

1853
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:56,970
- [Howard] Kelly plies her trade

1854
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:58,160
from a corner in the Bronx.

1855
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,120
- [Kelly] Hey, baby, you
lookin' for some company?

1856
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:01,740
- [Howard] She feeds her habit here

1857
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:03,430
at a nearby crack house.

1858
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:04,530
- [Man] What you need?

1859
01:16:05,648 --> 01:16:07,800
Whatever ails you, I got the cure.

1860
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,800
- [Howard] She has been
beaten, intimidated,

1861
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,180
raped, but nothing slakes her thirst.

1862
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:14,810
Nothing keeps her from coming back.

1863
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:17,080
Kelly and her boyfriend,
Dwayne, have come home

1864
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,910
not to see her family but
to scavenge money for drugs.

1865
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:20,743
- [Jeri] Oh yeah?

1866
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:21,576
Well, how about you?

1867
01:16:21,576 --> 01:16:23,560
Whose house did she come to to shoot up?

1868
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,820
- Well, where was she gonna go?

1869
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:26,526
To you and one of your boyfriends?

1870
01:16:26,526 --> 01:16:27,359
- Why not?

1871
01:16:27,359 --> 01:16:29,800
(audience murmurs)

1872
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,830
- [Howard] Why are you here now?

1873
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:33,350
- I needed some money.

1874
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:35,980
- [Howard] Your family
gives you money for drugs?

1875
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:38,350
- [Kelly] No, I take it.

1876
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:40,233
- [Howard] How do you feel about that?

1877
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,050
What about prostitution?

1878
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:46,450
How does that make you feel?

1879
01:16:48,942 --> 01:16:50,890
(sad music)

1880
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:52,046
Do you ever feel--

1881
01:16:52,046 --> 01:16:55,110
- Why do you keep on asking me how I feel?

1882
01:16:57,203 --> 01:17:02,063
I don't, I don't feel anything.

1883
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:04,263
I.

1884
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:08,659
- You talk to these girls
with such understanding,

1885
01:17:08,659 --> 01:17:11,350
and you treat them like human beings

1886
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:15,830
instead of garbage that
belongs in the gutter,

1887
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:20,670
so I know (sighs) you will hear me too.

1888
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:21,503
Please, Howard.

1889
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,923
Please, Howard, help me save my daughter.

1890
01:17:31,999 --> 01:17:33,749
Please stop the pain.

1891
01:17:35,667 --> 01:17:38,167
(Jeri crying)

1892
01:17:48,010 --> 01:17:52,415
- Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet Kelly.

1893
01:17:52,415 --> 01:17:55,582
(audience applauding)

1894
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,500
Kelly, after seeing yourself like that,

1895
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:06,800
how does it make you feel?

1896
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:10,043
- Ashamed.

1897
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:14,730
- But you're drug free now?

1898
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:17,846
- Yes.

1899
01:18:17,846 --> 01:18:21,013
(audience applauding)

1900
01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:26,760
- How did she get started?

1901
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:29,320
- How did you get started?

1902
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,173
- Um.

1903
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,773
I knew this girl at school,

1904
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:41,653
and um, it was a real
rush at first, you know?

1905
01:18:43,778 --> 01:18:45,373
But now it's not.

1906
01:18:46,230 --> 01:18:47,343
It's work.

1907
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:50,520
It's hard work.

1908
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:55,520
You lie, you cheat, you steal,

1909
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:59,300
you turn tricks, you do whatever.

1910
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,520
- And you're gonna stay clean?

1911
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,413
- I'm gonna try.

1912
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:06,990
(audience applauding)

1913
01:19:10,994 --> 01:19:12,107
- When we come back,
we'll talk with two people

1914
01:19:12,107 --> 01:19:16,064
who are determined to
help Kelly keep that vow.

1915
01:19:16,064 --> 01:19:20,000
(audience applauding)

1916
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,894
- This girl is a gold mine.

1917
01:19:21,894 --> 01:19:24,890
You wanted to give up our claim?

1918
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:27,473
(upbeat music)

1919
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:33,425
- Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome Jeri and Brenda.

1920
01:19:33,425 --> 01:19:36,592
(audience applauding)

1921
01:19:47,173 --> 01:19:50,263
Have a seat, and welcome
to the Howard Grant Show.

1922
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:56,943
What did you do to try to help Kelly?

1923
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,733
- We tried detox.

1924
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,893
We tried to get her into
a treatment program, but.

1925
01:20:06,590 --> 01:20:08,663
I even tried locking her in her room.

1926
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:12,400
- She's a beautiful girl when she's clean,

1927
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,680
but, you know, when she's high she steals.

1928
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,570
She steals from me and from Jeri,

1929
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:20,593
and she brings these terrible
people into our homes.

1930
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,100
- Kelly, how does that make you feel,

1931
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,400
knowing that you put
your family through that?

1932
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:27,563
- Like garbage.

1933
01:20:29,948 --> 01:20:32,540
But when you're high, you just don't care.

1934
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:33,707
- But I cared.

1935
01:20:35,865 --> 01:20:38,070
I never stopped caring about you.

1936
01:20:40,097 --> 01:20:42,597
(Jeri crying)

1937
01:20:43,690 --> 01:20:44,640
- You have a child.

1938
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:48,730
- [Kelly] She's in foster care,

1939
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:51,890
but she's clean.

1940
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:54,540
I went off the stuff when
I found out I was pregnant.

1941
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:59,220
- You had her for two months,

1942
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:02,423
and then you went back on the drugs again.

1943
01:21:03,338 --> 01:21:04,793
- Yeah, but I loved her.

1944
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:06,960
I still love her.

1945
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:07,937
- Of course you do, Kelly.

1946
01:21:07,937 --> 01:21:09,580
I'm just trying to understand here.

1947
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:11,645
- You think I like knowing that she

1948
01:21:11,645 --> 01:21:12,973
calls someone else mom?

1949
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:19,177
I just wasn't strong enough.

1950
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,563
I just wasn't strong enough.

1951
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,510
- Kelly, would you like to see Joey?

1952
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:33,414
Would you like to see
your little girl again?

1953
01:21:33,414 --> 01:21:34,247
- Yeah.

1954
01:21:34,247 --> 01:21:35,680
- Ladies and gentlemen, we've arranged

1955
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,520
a little surprise for Kelly.

1956
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,030
Joey's adoptive parents have brought

1957
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:40,820
her here to see Kelly.

1958
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:43,080
So now let's please welcome Lee,

1959
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,438
Kathleen and Joey.
- What?

1960
01:21:44,438 --> 01:21:45,388
Adoptive parents?

1961
01:21:45,388 --> 01:21:48,182
She's in foster care, Mom!

1962
01:21:48,182 --> 01:21:49,565
(dramatic music)

1963
01:21:49,565 --> 01:21:52,815
(audience applauding)

1964
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:04,800
- Now, bear in mind, Joey doesn't know

1965
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,510
that Kelly is her biological mother.

1966
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:08,850
She's been told she's
here to meet her aunt,

1967
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:11,250
so we're depending on
your discretion, audience.

1968
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:16,140
At two, Joey is a bright, lively child

1969
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:18,230
with no sign of addiction.

1970
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:20,810
And now, let's introduce Joey to Kelly.

1971
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:21,643
Kathleen?

1972
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:30,234
(Joey crying)

1973
01:22:33,924 --> 01:22:35,424
- Joey, it's okay.

1974
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:37,953
It's okay.

1975
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,203
It's all right.

1976
01:22:40,054 --> 01:22:41,221
Oh, it's okay.

1977
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:49,725
- She isn't very good with strangers.

1978
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:54,150
- She's probably just upset by the crowd.

1979
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:56,663
I'm sure, in time, she'll come round.

1980
01:22:57,810 --> 01:23:00,793
Unfortunately, we're out of time.

1981
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:03,820
But before we go, let me just say

1982
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:07,530
that what you have seen here
today is a cautionary tale,

1983
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:09,713
but one that may yet end happily.

1984
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:12,900
Lee and Kathleen have told us

1985
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:16,970
that if Kelly stays clean
and off the streets,

1986
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:18,790
they'll consider letting her visit Joey

1987
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:20,380
from time to time.

1988
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:25,380
Well, until tomorrow,
goodbye and God bless.

1989
01:23:28,658 --> 01:23:31,825
(audience applauding)

1990
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,620
- [Diane] Why wasn't I told?

1991
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:39,890
- You were getting cold feet,

1992
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:41,400
so I put Jimmy on it.

1993
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,880
He's not hamstrung by scruples.

1994
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,880
- Sadie, they're people, you know!

1995
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:46,990
They're not puppets!

1996
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:48,750
- That is where you're wrong, Diane.

1997
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:50,280
The are nothing but puppets.

1998
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,510
Puppets jerked around by
their pathetic desires.

1999
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:53,910
- I'm gonna go check on her.

2000
01:23:59,591 --> 01:24:00,640
- Hey, Diane, great show.

2001
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,410
When I grow up, I want
to be just like you.

2002
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:03,250
- Where's Kelly?

2003
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:04,620
- You know that old saying in talk.

2004
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:05,870
In in a limo, out in a taxi.

2005
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:06,871
I sent her home.

2006
01:24:06,871 --> 01:24:07,704
- What?

2007
01:24:07,704 --> 01:24:08,537
(whistle blowing)

2008
01:24:08,537 --> 01:24:09,812
Oh, Kelly!

2009
01:24:09,812 --> 01:24:10,645
Kelly!

2010
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:16,136
What happened?

2011
01:24:16,136 --> 01:24:19,040
- We, uh, we had words.

2012
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,190
- She guessed it.

2013
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:23,183
- That I agreed to the adoption.

2014
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:26,200
I didn't want to, but I couldn't

2015
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,913
take care of her myself.

2016
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:30,970
Other foster homes were terrible.

2017
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:32,905
- Okay, okay, just tell
me, where did she go?

2018
01:24:32,905 --> 01:24:33,967
- We don't know.

2019
01:24:33,967 --> 01:24:35,812
She just grabbed that taxi that the nice

2020
01:24:35,812 --> 01:24:37,393
young man just hailed for us.

2021
01:24:38,954 --> 01:24:41,704
(dramatic music)

2022
01:24:43,164 --> 01:24:44,417
- Sure, I know her.

2023
01:24:44,417 --> 01:24:46,723
But I ain't seen her in a couple of weeks.

2024
01:24:47,703 --> 01:24:48,953
What can I say?

2025
01:24:50,174 --> 01:24:51,591
That's how it is.

2026
01:24:53,032 --> 01:24:54,876
See ya, college girl.

2027
01:24:54,876 --> 01:24:59,876
Hey, (speaking in foreign language)

2028
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,030
- Kelly Lonigan.

2029
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:06,880
Look, I know she comes here all the time.

2030
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,143
- You want information, dial zero.

2031
01:25:10,090 --> 01:25:12,710
You want a lift, come talk to me.

2032
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:19,025
- Well, maybe, maybe you can
relieve my ignorance, huh?

2033
01:25:20,906 --> 01:25:22,489
- I ain't seen her.

2034
01:25:32,061 --> 01:25:34,478
(slow music)

2035
01:25:42,154 --> 01:25:42,987
- [Kelly] I went off the stuff

2036
01:25:42,987 --> 01:25:45,251
when I found out I was pregnant.

2037
01:25:45,251 --> 01:25:47,995
- [Howard] And then you
went back on the drugs?

2038
01:25:47,995 --> 01:25:50,431
- [Kelly] (crying) Yeah, but I loved her.

2039
01:25:50,431 --> 01:25:51,730
I still love her.

2040
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,080
- [Howard] Of course you do, Kelly.

2041
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,756
I'm just trying to understand here.

2042
01:25:54,756 --> 01:25:55,920
- [Kelly] Do you think I like knowing

2043
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,607
that she calls someone else mom?

2044
01:26:01,232 --> 01:26:06,232
I just wasn't strong enough.

2045
01:26:07,484 --> 01:26:09,817
I just wasn't strong enough.

2046
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:11,850
- Would you like to see Joey?

2047
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:14,853
Would you like to see your little girl?

2048
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:19,770
Ladies and gentlemen, we've arranged

2049
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:21,343
a little surprise for Kelly.

2050
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:23,980
Joey's adoptive parents have brought

2051
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:25,340
her here to see Kelly.
- What?

2052
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:28,683
- Please welcome Lee, Kathleen and Joey.

2053
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:32,930
(audience applauding)

2054
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:40,003
Now, bear in mind, Joey doesn't know

2055
01:26:40,003 --> 01:26:41,980
that Kelly is her biological mother.

2056
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:44,310
She's been told she's
here to meet her aunt,

2057
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:47,670
so we're depending on
your discretion, audience.

2058
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:51,410
At two, Joey is a bright, lively child

2059
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:53,697
with no sign of addiction.

2060
01:26:53,697 --> 01:26:57,733
And now, let's introduce Joey to Kelly.

2061
01:26:58,795 --> 01:26:59,628
Kathleen?

2062
01:27:00,644 --> 01:27:03,144
(Joey crying)

2063
01:27:04,383 --> 01:27:07,275
(dramatic music)

2064
01:27:07,275 --> 01:27:08,120
- It's okay.

2065
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:09,636
It's okay.

2066
01:27:09,636 --> 01:27:10,886
It's all right.

2067
01:27:16,512 --> 01:27:18,124
- She's not very good with strangers.

2068
01:27:18,124 --> 01:27:20,063
(spoon clattering)

2069
01:27:20,063 --> 01:27:22,400
- [Howard] She's probably
just upset by the crowd.

2070
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,883
I'm sure in time, she'll come round.

2071
01:27:26,364 --> 01:27:29,010
Unfortunately, we are out of time.

2072
01:27:32,348 --> 01:27:34,848
(phone rings)

2073
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:40,933
- Hello.

2074
01:27:42,916 --> 01:27:45,333
(slow music)

2075
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:49,900
- Yes, I ordered it, for the
hallway outside the stage.

2076
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:52,000
Does it look like it belongs in an office?

2077
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:56,360
Yeah, well, I am not interested
in union regulations.

2078
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,990
I am interested in getting the damn thing

2079
01:27:57,990 --> 01:27:59,060
out of my office!

2080
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:00,000
- Diane.

2081
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,833
We just heard.

2082
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:02,640
I'm so sorry.
- Ugh, he put me on hold.

2083
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,313
We did not kill that girl, Diane.

2084
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:10,710
- I've heard the speech, Sadie.

2085
01:28:10,710 --> 01:28:12,143
- She killed herself,

2086
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:14,980
and she would've done it if she'd never

2087
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:17,870
heard of you or the Howard Grant Show.

2088
01:28:17,870 --> 01:28:18,703
- Maybe.

2089
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:25,530
- We, we deal with people
who are dysfunctional,

2090
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:28,540
and there is nothing that
anyone can do for them.

2091
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:29,763
So let it go.

2092
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:31,743
- I already have.

2093
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:34,553
I'm quitting.

2094
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,740
- What?

2095
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:40,593
- I'm quitting.

2096
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:42,970
- I didn't hear that.

2097
01:28:42,970 --> 01:28:44,600
I refuse to hear that.

2098
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,210
- Well, I guess you'll
just have to be surprised

2099
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:47,850
when I don't show up for work tomorrow.

2100
01:28:47,850 --> 01:28:51,110
- [Sadie] Uh ha, you want more money.

2101
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:54,180
- I don't want any more money, Sadie.

2102
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:56,883
I just, I don't want any more.

2103
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:00,533
- How much?

2104
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:06,870
Please, who is it?

2105
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:07,703
Geraldo?

2106
01:29:07,703 --> 01:29:09,073
I'll double the offer.

2107
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:12,760
Jeffrey, I didn't expect you.

2108
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,280
- Are we, uh, losing that girl?

2109
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,113
- Of course not.

2110
01:29:15,113 --> 01:29:16,700
She's just negotiating.

2111
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,050
- Unlike your ex-boyfriend.

2112
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:20,323
- [Sadie] What's this?

2113
01:29:20,323 --> 01:29:24,990
- That's a $12 million lawsuit
for wrongful termination.

2114
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:27,730
- He couldn't possibly--

2115
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:30,130
- I hope not, Sadie, for your sake,

2116
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:33,140
because I'm not prepared
to pay $12 million

2117
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:34,553
for an executive producer.

2118
01:29:37,243 --> 01:29:39,576
(sad music)

2119
01:30:02,872 --> 01:30:04,354
- [Officiant] And I
will dwell in the house

2120
01:30:04,354 --> 01:30:06,021
of the Lord forever.

2121
01:30:07,121 --> 01:30:07,954
Amen.

2122
01:30:07,954 --> 01:30:08,787
- Amen.

2123
01:30:10,670 --> 01:30:12,073
I'm going back to news.

2124
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:15,860
It's where I started,
and it's where I belong.

2125
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:19,690
- But you're doing such
wonderful work with Howard.

2126
01:30:19,690 --> 01:30:22,347
We'll never forget what you did for us

2127
01:30:22,347 --> 01:30:23,490
and for Kelly.

2128
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:24,990
- Never.

2129
01:30:24,990 --> 01:30:28,092
You and Howard were the
only ones who cared.

2130
01:30:28,092 --> 01:30:29,740
You were the only ones that even noticed

2131
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:30,640
that she left us.

2132
01:30:33,230 --> 01:30:34,590
- You spoke with Howard?

2133
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:38,033
- Yes, he called to offer his condolences,

2134
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:42,403
and he invited us to join
him on the show again.

2135
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:47,110
He said maybe we could help some other

2136
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:49,573
girl in Kelly's situation.

2137
01:31:09,429 --> 01:31:12,096
I'm so sorry you won't be there.

2138
01:31:14,156 --> 01:31:14,989
Thank you.

2139
01:31:21,445 --> 01:31:24,528
You treated Kelly like a human being.

2140
01:31:26,937 --> 01:31:29,270
(sad music)

2141
01:31:46,065 --> 01:31:49,232
(audience applauding)

2142
01:31:57,408 --> 01:31:58,960
- Dwayne under control?
- Jeri, Brenda, thanks

2143
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,013
for coming.
- Oh yeah,

2144
01:32:00,013 --> 01:32:00,846
I've Jimmy watching him.

2145
01:32:00,846 --> 01:32:05,063
- I am so very, very sorry.

2146
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:13,883
Before we begin, I'd like
to share something with you.

2147
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:19,510
You see, the reason I feel so deeply

2148
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:24,510
about Kelly's fate is that I nearly

2149
01:32:24,810 --> 01:32:27,480
lost my son, Ted, to drugs some years ago.

2150
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:28,430
- What is he doing?

2151
01:32:29,570 --> 01:32:31,220
- Like
- I believe it's called

2152
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:32,500
ad libbing.
- so many other parents,

2153
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:35,620
my wife and I ignored
the early warning signs,

2154
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:37,610
rationalizing Ted's behavior
- What is that going to

2155
01:32:37,610 --> 01:32:39,290
do to Ted?
- As nothing more

2156
01:32:39,290 --> 01:32:41,612
than adolescent
- Who cares?

2157
01:32:41,612 --> 01:32:43,333
- rebellion.
- It's great theater.

2158
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:46,220
- After all, it's a teenager's
- You're right.

2159
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:48,280
- job to be selfish,
- It doesn't get

2160
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:50,346
any better than this.
- withdrawn

2161
01:32:50,346 --> 01:32:51,179
- Uh uh.

2162
01:32:53,313 --> 01:32:55,970
- [Howard] and secretive.

2163
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:57,783
By the time we woke up, Ted had almost

2164
01:32:57,783 --> 01:32:59,616
died from an overdose.

2165
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:04,240
Fortunately, Ted's story had a happier

2166
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:05,540
ending than Kelly's.

2167
01:33:05,540 --> 01:33:08,973
He's clean, for now.

2168
01:33:11,390 --> 01:33:13,967
But it will always be day to day.

2169
01:33:14,977 --> 01:33:16,377
But it could just as easily.

2170
01:33:17,221 --> 01:33:19,739
(upbeat music)

2171
01:33:19,739 --> 01:33:22,322
(gentle music)

2172
