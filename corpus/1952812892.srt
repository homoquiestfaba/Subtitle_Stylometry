1
00:00:01,861 --> 00:00:04,261
I may be on the verge

2
00:00:04,345 --> 00:00:07,245
of discovering the true nature
of Destiny's mission.

3
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,408
You've had
control of this ship

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,630
the whole time!

5
00:00:11,664 --> 00:00:13,164
Why wouldn't you tell anyone?

6
00:00:13,224 --> 00:00:14,624
The Lucian
alliance is planning

7
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:15,873
an attack on Earth.

8
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:17,421
I killed Riley.

9
00:00:17,432 --> 00:00:19,533
I suffocated him
with my own hands.

10
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:21,902
You are a good commander.

11
00:00:21,903 --> 00:00:23,137
There is no mission

12
00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:24,905
other than getting
these people home.

13
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:26,540
It was never about
going home.

14
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:27,808
It's about getting us
to where we're going.

15
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:30,544
That is the mission.

16
00:00:30,545 --> 00:00:32,479
I've just been going over
the shuttle's navigational data

17
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,814
trying to figure out

18
00:00:33,815 --> 00:00:35,149
The path you took
back to Destiny.

19
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,717
It seems you were there,
and then you were here.

20
00:00:36,718 --> 00:00:38,319
Nothing in between.

21
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,921
Every square inch of this thing
is in perfect factory condition.

22
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:42,590
:There's hundreds
of these things!

23
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:43,991
There's no way we're going to
be able to shoot them all down!

24
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:45,693
How's that
damage report coming?

25
00:00:45,694 --> 00:00:46,794
I'll arrange
a briefing when we're ready,

26
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:48,028
but it's not going to be pretty.

27
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:49,997
I'm
supposed to be back to normal.

28
00:00:49,998 --> 00:00:51,365
You managed to retain

29
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:52,700
some of the knowledge
you gained.

30
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:53,667
I should think
that's a good thing.

31
00:00:53,668 --> 00:00:55,436
Because I can still be useful.

32
00:00:55,437 --> 00:00:57,705
Everyone on this ship
is useful.

33
00:00:57,706 --> 00:01:00,341
We all belong here.

34
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:03,911
All right,
somebody say something.

35
00:01:03,912 --> 00:01:05,613
How bad is it?

36
00:01:05,614 --> 00:01:07,381
It isn't any one thing,
it's the accumulation.

37
00:01:07,382 --> 00:01:10,117
This ship just wasn't up
to fighting a battle like that.

38
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:11,952
A big chunk of the life support

39
00:01:11,953 --> 00:01:13,120
is still down, too.

40
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:14,955
Well, you can repair it, right?

41
00:01:14,956 --> 00:01:16,290
With what?

42
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,157
Even if we knew how,

43
00:01:17,158 --> 00:01:18,225
we don't have the spare parts.

44
00:01:18,226 --> 00:01:19,660
I mean, I'm talking
about things

45
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:21,795
that are broken
and burnt out that...

46
00:01:21,796 --> 00:01:23,998
That I don't even know
what they do.

47
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:25,599
Now, if life support
was our only problem,

48
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,067
we might be able to
figure something out.

49
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:28,469
But there are dozens of systems

50
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,470
on the brink of failure.

51
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:31,605
Weapons, shields...

52
00:01:31,606 --> 00:01:33,073
Well, they're operating.

53
00:01:33,074 --> 00:01:34,908
And at mission critical levels?

54
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:37,778
We are down

55
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:38,846
to one last everything.

56
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:40,114
There's practically
no redundancy.

57
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:41,482
"Practically no redundancy..."

58
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:42,750
Wasn't funny
the first three times!

59
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:45,019
Well, I'm very tired.

60
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,754
Okay, we know
what the problems are.

61
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:49,657
What are the solutions?

62
00:01:49,658 --> 00:01:52,026
Well, what I think
we're trying to say...

63
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:53,427
We make do as best we can

64
00:01:53,428 --> 00:01:54,528
and carry on with the mission.

65
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:55,529
Well, it doesn't sound like

66
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,697
that's what they were
trying to say.

67
00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:58,065
You're talking like
we have a choice here.

68
00:01:58,066 --> 00:01:59,099
Actually...

69
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,501
Eli, please...

70
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:02,569
Ginn and I figured out

71
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,405
how to dial
the ninth chevron back to Earth

72
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:07,041
while Destiny recharges
in a star.

73
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:09,109
Without blowing up
the ship, you mean?

74
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,010
Yeah.

75
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:10,844
No.

76
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:12,546
Here we go.

77
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:13,914
Look, Eli's solution,
however brilliant,

78
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:15,049
fails to consider

79
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,583
the thousand things
that could go wrong

80
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:18,686
when attempting to open
a wormhole in a star.

81
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:20,054
I can show you the simulation.

82
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:21,288
More to the point,

83
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:22,656
it could cause
the same kind of overload

84
00:02:22,657 --> 00:02:24,058
that happened on Icarus.

85
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:25,092
Well, who cares

86
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:26,627
if we're not even
going to be here?

87
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:27,461
Well, I do, lieutenant.

88
00:02:27,462 --> 00:02:28,796
Along with anyone else

89
00:02:28,797 --> 00:02:29,563
who cares to remain
aboard this ship.

90
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:30,931
Rush, come on, man.

91
00:02:30,932 --> 00:02:32,199
Nobody in their right mind
would stay.

92
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,867
You said you understood
how important this mission was.

93
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:35,736
I did.

94
00:02:35,737 --> 00:02:37,137
So, what's changed?

95
00:02:37,138 --> 00:02:38,672
Nicholas,
you know what's changed.

96
00:02:38,673 --> 00:02:40,741
Look I was all aboard
with this, you know that,

97
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:41,875
but if the ship can't fly,

98
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:43,043
there is no mission.

99
00:02:43,044 --> 00:02:44,545
It's not like we're
just giving up here.

100
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:45,746
Well, that's exactly
what we're doing.

101
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:47,214
Well, fortunately for
the people on this ship,

102
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:48,749
the decision
is not yours to make.

103
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,451
Well, thankfully it's not
your bloody decision either...

104
00:02:50,452 --> 00:02:52,086
Rush!

105
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:53,721
We can get through this!
They are just being defeatist!

106
00:02:53,722 --> 00:02:55,556
My first responsibility

107
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:57,891
is the safety of these people.

108
00:02:57,892 --> 00:02:58,959
I'm sorry.

109
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:02,963
Yeah, right.

111
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:29,409
Oh, whoa.

112
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,276
Stand aside, sergeant.

113
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,577
Hey...

114
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:32,945
I can't do that.

115
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,347
Colonel's orders.

116
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,615
Since when?

117
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,450
Just now.

118
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,585
Did he say why?

119
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,921
I didn't ask.

120
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,623
Okay, could you tell me

121
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:44,991
where else
I've been banned from?

122
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:46,826
Save me wasting my time.

123
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:49,395
Pretty much any place
that you can push buttons.

124
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,397
Ah.

125
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,399
And I've got people
where all the buttons are.

126
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,273
Destiny's course
is taking us toward a star

127
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:02,742
roughly 18 hours ahead,

128
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:03,976
We assume to recharge.

129
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,878
We...
We should be ready.

130
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,947
Oh, we've been ready
for a long time.

131
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,182
I'm ready, and I just got here.

132
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:11,284
I can only imagine
what it's like for you.

133
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,425
Hi.

134
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,893
We've been expecting you.

135
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,029
Well, it seems you can predict
my every move.

136
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,764
Well, I had to make sure

137
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,832
you didn't lock us out of
the dialing programs.

138
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:30,903
The thought
never crossed my mind.

139
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,506
I see the elders have gathered.

140
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:38,578
You should know Eli is using
the stones right now

141
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,913
to run his calculations
by the best people on Earth.

142
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:41,914
They'll tell him
what I told him.

143
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:42,949
The work is brilliant,

144
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,517
but what works on paper

145
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:45,785
does not necessarily
work within a star.

146
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,787
Well, Eli said

147
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:48,921
that he's taken that
into consideration.

148
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,457
Eli is not an astrophysicist.

149
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,993
Inside a star

150
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,928
there are magnetic fields,

151
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,431
enormous pressures,
solar flares,

152
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:01,434
conditions that make events
unpredictable

153
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:02,802
by any mathematics.

154
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,638
Now, will Eli's

155
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,873
connection to Earth work?

156
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:07,874
Possibly,

157
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,342
But what happens

158
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:10,710
the moment that wormhole
has been established

159
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,111
is anybody's guess.

160
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,680
It could blow a hole
in the fabric of space-time.

161
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,082
He's out of his freaking mind,
you know that.

162
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,617
All right.

163
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,886
So, what are you
asking us to do?

164
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:23,022
Let me talk to the crew.

165
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:23,923
At least some
of them understand

166
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:24,957
how important it is

167
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,392
to remain on this ship...

168
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:27,426
Nobody is going to
agree to that!

169
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,028
You say

170
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,696
you have no choice
but to leave.

171
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,732
I have no choice but to stay.

172
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,669
We're going to brief everyone
in the gate-room

173
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,037
the minute we come out of FTL.

174
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,105
You can address them then.

175
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,376
It would carry far more weight

176
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,845
if you were standing
alongside me.

177
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,848
I can do that.

178
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:58,357
Thank you.

179
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,030
You're not serious.

180
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,799
Oh, I think he is.

181
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,474
We've run the simulation
a dozen times.

182
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,843
It works.

183
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,078
So, the gamer came up with
power flow algorithm?

184
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,880
Eli, yeah.

185
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,348
I gotta say, you know,

186
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:23,716
when we tried to solve
this back on Earth,

187
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,886
There we a lot of
smart people in that room.

188
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,521
Yeah, well, don't
tell him I said this,

189
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:29,755
but he's arguably
the smartest person

190
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:30,857
I've ever met...

191
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,125
You all right?

192
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,527
I'm fine. I'm back.

193
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:35,661
What did they say?

194
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,064
The math works, so we're on.

195
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,002
Who was the smartest person
you were just talking about?

196
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,605
Einstein?

197
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,743
Einstein.

198
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,813
Yeah, he was-
he was pretty smart.

199
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:56,048
But don't ever tell him
you said that?

200
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,416
All right, come on,

201
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,018
Let's go tell
the colonel the news.

202
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,384
Hey, T.J., can you
give us a minute?

203
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:32,385
Yeah.

204
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,688
Can you keep this ship flying?

205
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:36,889
Yeah, with help.

206
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,924
Then I need to know

207
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,659
an absolute minimum
number of personnel

208
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,927
You need to do it.

209
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,496
Well, as many as possible,
obviously.

210
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:44,664
I need a number.

211
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,732
I'll say a dozen.

212
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,134
Plus you and me?

213
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,140
No, including us.

214
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,141
So 10.

215
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,144
Yeah, look,
I-I've written down

216
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,712
most of what I intend to say.

217
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,314
If you've got anything
you might want to add...

218
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,683
<i>Everett, is Rush</i>
<i>in the gate-room with you?</i>

219
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:04,917
Yeah, what is it?

220
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,719
<i>I need both of you</i>
<i>on the bridge.</i>

221
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,120
We don't have time
for this just now.

222
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,555
David, we were just going
to talk to the crew.

223
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,589
Can it wait?

224
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,824
<i>Negative!</i>

225
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,025
<i>Get up here.</i>
<i>Trust me.</i>

226
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,427
We have time.

227
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:16,696
Yeah.

228
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:19,632
Time they might need to decide.

229
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,100
Just keep everyone here,
we'll be right back.

230
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,769
Uh, sure.

231
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,879
What is it?

232
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,982
It was in orbit
around the star.

233
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:38,017
Destiny picked it up
when it turned towards us,

234
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,819
and then we got
the radio broadcast.

235
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,687
From who?

236
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,556
You.

237
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,058
I don't understand.

238
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,127
Neither do we.

239
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,795
Wait for it...

240
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,065
Wait for what?

241
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,567
<i>I repeat, this is</i>
<i>Dr. Nicholas Rush</i>

242
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,435
<i>Calling the Destiny.</i>

243
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,737
<i>I'm aboard the shuttle</i>
<i>headed your way.</i>

244
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,071
<i>Please respond.</i>

245
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,807
Well, isn't this

246
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,075
an interesting turn of events?

247
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,810
What is this?

248
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:05,778
Well, I wouldn't know, colonel.

249
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,680
How about you tell me?

250
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,948
Well, it's not a recording,
if that's what you're thinking.

251
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,083
It's a subspace broadcast,

252
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,218
and beyond the fact

253
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,552
that it sounds
exactly like Rush,

254
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,855
I can tell that
that's our shuttle,

255
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,723
and it's on
an intercept course.

256
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,091
Even though according to this,

257
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,560
the shuttle is still docked
with Destiny.

258
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,762
<i>Again, this is Dr. Rush.</i>

259
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:23,996
<i>I need assistance with</i>
<i>the docking procedure.</i>

260
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,998
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

261
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,603
Have we responded yet?

262
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:31,871
No, not yet.

263
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,973
Well, best not
to keep me waiting.

264
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,514
Hello, this is also
Dr. Nicholas Rush.

265
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:42,882
How can we be of assistance?

266
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,485
<i>Tell them not to try</i>
<i>and dial Earth.</i>

267
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,054
<i>It won't work.</i>

268
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:49,121
<i>If they go through with it,</i>
<i>they're all going to die.</i>

269
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,423
This is colonel Young.

270
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,024
Doctor Rush is sitting
right next to me.

271
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,927
Yes, obviously.
We've just spoken.

272
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,695
The only reasonable explanation

273
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,932
is that somehow
I've come back through time.

274
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,201
Reasonable explanation?

275
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,569
<i>I couldn't be sure</i>

276
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,671
<i>until I seen you</i>
<i>dropping out of FTL,</i>

277
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,673
Which happened
roughly 12 hours ago

278
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:08,941
in my time-line.

279
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,777
And we're supposed to just
take your word for this?

280
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,213
Shortly after
we dropped out of FTL, colonel,

281
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,515
you asked me for a number.

282
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,751
I told you ten, plus two.

283
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,758
12?

284
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,660
That's well calculated,
Mr. Volker,

285
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:28,961
But I think you're
missing the point here.

286
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,262
Is that true?

287
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,564
Did you just have
that conversation?

288
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:34,567
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

289
00:10:46,274 --> 00:10:47,408
It's weird.

290
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:49,343
I was completely stoked
about this mission.

291
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:51,078
Yeah, we all were.

292
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:52,213
All of a sudden

293
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:54,315
I can't wait to see my kid.

294
00:10:54,316 --> 00:10:55,649
Wow.

295
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,218
Gosh, and I thought
the hardest thing

296
00:10:57,219 --> 00:10:58,786
was going to be
introducing you to my mom.

297
00:10:58,787 --> 00:11:00,154
Okay, that makes me
more nervous

298
00:11:00,155 --> 00:11:01,455
than goin' through
the dang gate.

299
00:11:01,456 --> 00:11:04,091
:Hey, when we get back,

300
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:05,960
we-we're all still
gonna hang out,

301
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:07,361
right?

302
00:11:07,362 --> 00:11:08,696
Yeah, of course we will.

303
00:11:08,697 --> 00:11:10,364
We will have
a reunion every year.

304
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:12,800
I was thinking more along
the lines of Fridays.

305
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:15,803
Depends on whether you're
stationed Earth-side.

306
00:11:15,804 --> 00:11:17,104
I can guarantee you

307
00:11:17,105 --> 00:11:19,006
that Earth will be my station.

308
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:20,374
But you're joining
Stargate command.

309
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,409
like they're gonna ask me.

310
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:24,411
They'll ask you, Eli.

311
00:11:24,412 --> 00:11:26,747
You'll be right up there

312
00:11:26,748 --> 00:11:28,149
with the other SGC brainiacs,

313
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:32,887
Like Dr. Jackson
and colonel Carter, and, uh...

314
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:34,255
What was that guy's name
who kept staring at your...

315
00:11:34,256 --> 00:11:36,123
Ugh, McKay.

316
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:37,792
Yeah, McKay.

317
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:38,826
They'll ask you right
when we get back.

318
00:11:38,827 --> 00:11:40,494
<i>Lieutenant Scott, come in.</i>

319
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:43,030
Yes, sir, is there-
is there a problem?

320
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:47,835
<i>Yeah. Join up with Greer,</i>
<i>head to shuttle bay 2.</i>

321
00:12:07,923 --> 00:12:09,290
Open it.

322
00:12:21,903 --> 00:12:23,871
Don't listen to him!

323
00:12:23,872 --> 00:12:25,139
He's going to try
and kill you all!

324
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:35,416
What in the hell?

325
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:37,084
T.J., this is Young.

326
00:12:37,085 --> 00:12:39,453
Yes, sir, the gang's all here.

327
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:41,155
<i>Yeah, they're going to</i>
<i>have to wait.</i>

328
00:12:41,156 --> 00:12:43,424
<i>We need you</i> <i>in the infirmary.</i>

329
00:12:56,938 --> 00:12:59,974
How did you get the burn?

330
00:12:59,975 --> 00:13:01,508
There was an overload.

331
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:03,677
I couldn't stop it.

332
00:13:03,678 --> 00:13:05,045
Explosions all over the ship

333
00:13:05,046 --> 00:13:07,982
one after another.

334
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:09,583
The air became so toxic,

335
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:11,418
I had no choice but to abandon.

336
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:12,720
At which point,

337
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:15,055
you somehow went back
12 hours in time?

338
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:19,059
No, no, no, that would have
to happen inside the star.

339
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,496
The ship itself must have passed
very near a solar flare

340
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:24,064
in the exact moment

341
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:25,866
we locked the ninth
chevron address.

342
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:27,301
A temporal event,

343
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:31,038
Like we've seen cause
time travel through wormholes.

344
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:33,007
It somehow affected
the entire ship.

345
00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:35,542
One of those
unpredictable things

346
00:13:35,543 --> 00:13:37,011
I remember warning you about.

347
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,450
What are you smiling at?

348
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:44,551
Well, you should know.

349
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:47,855
What, fascinating, is it?

350
00:13:47,856 --> 00:13:49,089
Well, you wouldn't think so

351
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,391
if you'd been through
what I've been through.

352
00:13:50,392 --> 00:13:52,493
Well, I won't have to now,
will I?

353
00:13:52,494 --> 00:13:54,094
Look, we can still do this

354
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:56,997
if we could just learn
from your mistakes.

355
00:13:56,998 --> 00:13:58,499
<i>My</i> mistakes?

356
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,100
The only mistake was trying it
in the first place!

357
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:02,136
No, no, wait a second,
she's right.

358
00:14:02,137 --> 00:14:03,537
Just because it went wrong
the first time round...

359
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:05,606
Wait, isn't it the same time
again?

360
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:07,174
No, not entirely.

361
00:14:07,175 --> 00:14:09,543
We'd end up with two of us
staying behind next time.

362
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:10,644
If we kept going long enough,

363
00:14:10,645 --> 00:14:12,112
we'd soon have an entire crew.

364
00:14:12,113 --> 00:14:14,048
We still have an hour
before we run Eli's program.

365
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:15,582
Tell us what happened.

366
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:19,019
Up to the point
you received my radio signal,

367
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,454
you know what happened...

368
00:14:20,455 --> 00:14:21,989
<i>I need a number.</i>

369
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,657
<i>I'll say a dozen.</i>

370
00:14:23,658 --> 00:14:25,392
<i>Plus you and me?</i>

371
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,398
<i>No, including us.</i>

372
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,399
<i>So 10.</i>

373
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:35,402
<i>Yeah, look,</i> <i>I've written down</i>

374
00:14:35,403 --> 00:14:36,637
<i>Most of what</i> <i>I intend to say.</i>

375
00:14:36,638 --> 00:14:37,771
<i>If you've got anything</i>
<i>you might want to add...</i>

376
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:39,907
<i>So, I'll speak</i>
<i>when you're done,</i>

377
00:14:39,908 --> 00:14:41,575
<i>But just so we're clear,</i>

378
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:43,010
<i>if we don't get</i>
<i>the 10 volunteers...</i>

379
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:44,945
<i>We will.</i>

380
00:14:44,946 --> 00:14:46,914
<i>Okay.</i>

381
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:52,286
You were true
to your word, colonel.

382
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:55,222
You stood alongside me.

383
00:14:55,223 --> 00:14:56,790
Ladies and gentlemen,

384
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,125
if I could have
your attention, please?

385
00:14:58,126 --> 00:14:59,960
Dr. Rush would like to say
a few words.

386
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:08,936
My friends...

387
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,240
Well, yes, perhaps that's...

388
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:15,609
an overstatement,

389
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,178
but we are at least shipmates,

390
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:25,252
who have, up until now,
shared great adversity.

391
00:15:25,253 --> 00:15:27,121
I know a lot of you,

392
00:15:27,122 --> 00:15:29,390
probably most of you,

393
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:30,624
also share the hope

394
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,127
of going home.

395
00:15:33,128 --> 00:15:34,228
It is a fact

396
00:15:34,229 --> 00:15:35,462
that the conditions
inside a star

397
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:37,698
bode very poorly

398
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:40,734
for the sustained viability
of a wormhole,

399
00:15:40,735 --> 00:15:42,703
and I owe it to you all
to tell you that.

400
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:45,005
Stop trying to scare people
and get on with this.

401
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:50,544
The ancients did not devote

402
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:51,979
the efforts of
an entire generation

403
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,080
to build this ship

404
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:54,615
on a whim.

405
00:15:54,616 --> 00:15:58,752
Neither was Destiny
named on a whim.

406
00:15:58,753 --> 00:16:00,487
Over a million years ago,

407
00:16:00,488 --> 00:16:04,391
the ancients discovered
a complex structure

408
00:16:04,392 --> 00:16:07,161
buried deep within
the background radiation,

409
00:16:07,162 --> 00:16:09,296
the fingerprints
of an intelligence

410
00:16:09,297 --> 00:16:11,532
that existed very near

411
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:14,601
the beginning of time itself.

412
00:16:14,602 --> 00:16:17,704
Destiny was launched
in search of that intelligence.

413
00:16:17,705 --> 00:16:19,973
Who knows how close we are

414
00:16:19,974 --> 00:16:21,341
to finding it?

415
00:16:21,342 --> 00:16:23,110
How close we are to learning,

416
00:16:23,111 --> 00:16:25,979
in the ancients' words,

417
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,049
"the Destiny of all things."

418
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,520
I don't pretend to know
when that's going to be,

419
00:16:33,521 --> 00:16:35,589
in which stars it will happen,

420
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,157
or even how that

421
00:16:37,158 --> 00:16:39,226
will change our view
of the universe.

422
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:41,562
I only know

423
00:16:41,563 --> 00:16:44,631
that Destiny has come this far,

424
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:48,635
and if we abandon her now...

425
00:16:48,636 --> 00:16:52,773
there'll be no coming back.

426
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:58,445
All of that knowledge
will be lost forever.

427
00:16:58,446 --> 00:17:04,151
I believe this journey
is the reason I'm here,

428
00:17:04,152 --> 00:17:07,454
but I can't hope
to do it alone.

429
00:17:07,455 --> 00:17:11,158
I ask you to come with me.

430
00:17:13,495 --> 00:17:15,295
Now, I, uh,

431
00:17:15,296 --> 00:17:19,166
I believe that those of you
who want to go home

432
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:20,400
deserve that chance,

433
00:17:20,401 --> 00:17:25,606
but I joined Stargate command
for a reason,

434
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:29,810
so I too
am willing to stay aboard.

435
00:17:31,713 --> 00:17:38,152
What we are looking for
are 10 volunteers,

436
00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:41,455
so I am asking those of you

437
00:17:41,456 --> 00:17:44,191
who want to be here,

438
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:46,293
please step forward.

439
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:31,338
All right, listen to me!

440
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:32,806
You've already accomplished

441
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:34,875
the damn mission!

442
00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:36,777
Our goal was to investigate

443
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:38,245
the ninth chevron address,

444
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:39,746
and you've done that.

445
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:42,249
Now, I do not deny

446
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,951
that there once was a mission,

447
00:18:43,952 --> 00:18:45,752
but if it was as important
as Rush claims it to be,

448
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:47,888
they sure as hell couldn't
expect us to do it.

449
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:51,158
There is no noble voyage

450
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:52,526
to save the universe
or to meet God,

451
00:18:52,527 --> 00:18:53,860
or whatever it is

452
00:18:53,861 --> 00:18:55,495
that Rush has sold you on!

453
00:18:55,496 --> 00:18:58,198
there is only the day
that this ship dies!

454
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:00,367
David, we don't know that.

455
00:19:00,368 --> 00:19:01,802
I've got a good mind

456
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:03,470
to try to take you all back
by force.

457
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:06,240
Good luck with that.

458
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:13,447
Those of you still
taking part in the evacuation

459
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:15,382
are going to form two lines.

460
00:19:15,383 --> 00:19:18,185
Everything we carry with us
becomes a projectile

461
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:19,753
in a nine-chevron transit,

462
00:19:19,754 --> 00:19:21,521
so we are going home
with the clothes on our backs,

463
00:19:21,522 --> 00:19:22,889
nothing more.

464
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,759
Eli has warned them
to expect us,

465
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,428
but it seems that
a radio signal does not reach

466
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:31,465
across a nine chevron
connection,

467
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:32,699
So I'll go first

468
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,201
to warn them
that we're on our way.

469
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:37,070
You will follow
in three-second intervals

470
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:37,938
two at a time.

471
00:19:37,939 --> 00:19:39,506
Eli, are we ready?

472
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:42,476
Yeah, the program’s all set.

473
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:44,478
You're good to go.

474
00:19:49,784 --> 00:19:51,285
15 minutes, people...

475
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:56,189
And we go home!

476
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,492
And 15 minutes after that,

477
00:19:58,493 --> 00:20:01,928
you were dead.

478
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:08,309
If all those people
stayed aboard,

479
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,410
why were you the only survivor?

480
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:11,112
I told you,
there was an overload.

481
00:20:11,113 --> 00:20:12,346
It doesn't matter.

482
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:14,081
We have a second chance now.

483
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:16,918
You just need to tell us
what went wrong,

484
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,986
what can we do differently.

485
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:20,521
Eli's program
is based on precise timing

486
00:20:20,522 --> 00:20:22,023
in the recharging process.

487
00:20:22,024 --> 00:20:23,524
A time which is
fast approaching.

488
00:20:23,525 --> 00:20:26,027
All right, so you dialed
the ninth chevron...

489
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:26,994
And?

490
00:20:26,995 --> 00:20:28,296
And it worked.

491
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:31,899
We made the connection.

492
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,392
Chevron nine is locked!

493
00:21:04,032 --> 00:21:06,233
Wait three seconds,
then follow me!

494
00:21:09,938 --> 00:21:11,205
No, no, wait, wait!

495
00:21:11,206 --> 00:21:12,540
Stop!

496
00:21:13,976 --> 00:21:15,242
What is it?

497
00:21:15,243 --> 00:21:16,978
The wormhole is unstable.
See for yourself.

498
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:18,312
Well, shut it down.

499
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:19,246
I can't.

500
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:20,247
One of the mains blew out.

501
00:21:20,248 --> 00:21:21,582
My program can't compensate.

502
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,150
We'll have to configure
the power levels on the fly.

503
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:25,252
Yes, Eli,
that's what I'm doing.

504
00:21:25,253 --> 00:21:26,253
I've almost got it.

505
00:21:26,254 --> 00:21:28,289
Everybody, stand by!

506
00:21:32,694 --> 00:21:34,295
That's as stable
as we're gonna get.

507
00:21:35,664 --> 00:21:37,398
Okay, go, go, go!

508
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:52,780
It's beginning to overload!

509
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:53,714
Well, we were supposed to be
gone by now!

510
00:21:53,715 --> 00:21:55,516
We can't stay ahead of this!

511
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:00,221
We're losing her!

512
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,290
That's it, everyone,
we're going through!

513
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,792
Let's go!

514
00:22:04,793 --> 00:22:05,626
All right, you heard him,
let's go!

515
00:22:05,627 --> 00:22:07,361
Come on!

516
00:22:10,632 --> 00:22:12,366
Eli, there's
nothing more you can do.

517
00:22:19,674 --> 00:22:21,208
Eli, get the hell out of here!

518
00:22:23,612 --> 00:22:25,212
Rush...

519
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:26,781
I can't maintain
a stable connection

520
00:22:26,782 --> 00:22:27,648
and argue with you
at the same time.

521
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:28,716
Now, please go.

522
00:22:30,285 --> 00:22:31,385
Go!

523
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:55,643
I don't really know
how long I stayed there.

524
00:22:55,644 --> 00:22:56,710
It felt like hours.

525
00:22:59,014 --> 00:23:02,249
I kept waiting for
the end to come,

526
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,651
but Destiny fought
to stay alive.

527
00:23:05,187 --> 00:23:07,221
How are you sure that we...

528
00:23:07,222 --> 00:23:08,422
They...

529
00:23:08,423 --> 00:23:09,390
All didn't make it?

530
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:13,794
I didn't say
they <i>all</i> didn't make it.

531
00:23:39,187 --> 00:23:40,621
I'm dr Rush.

532
00:23:40,622 --> 00:23:42,456
How many of them
made it through?

533
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:44,725
I'm sorry, sir.
Only one, hours ago.

534
00:23:44,726 --> 00:23:46,560
He's been waiting
to switch with someone

535
00:23:46,561 --> 00:23:49,530
to see why the others
didn't follow.

536
00:24:01,676 --> 00:24:03,811
The connection was made...

537
00:24:05,347 --> 00:24:07,748
but you were the only one
who made it through to Earth.

538
00:24:19,427 --> 00:24:22,296
We were told we'd be leaving
for Earth by now.

539
00:24:22,297 --> 00:24:24,465
What's happening?

540
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:26,167
Some funky, funky stuff, man.

541
00:24:26,168 --> 00:24:30,504
<i>Lieutenant Scott, come in.</i>

542
00:24:30,505 --> 00:24:32,473
Sir, you are cutting it
awful close here.

543
00:24:32,474 --> 00:24:34,642
Stand down, lieutenant,
we've decided not to go ahead.

544
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:36,477
You've got to be kidding me.

545
00:24:36,478 --> 00:24:37,444
Sir?

546
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:39,113
<i>We have reason to believe</i>

547
00:24:39,114 --> 00:24:40,714
<i>The evacuees will not</i>
<i>make it through alive.</i>

548
00:24:40,715 --> 00:24:42,416
Send everyone
to their quarters.

549
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:45,085
Understood.

550
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:55,529
You made the right decision.

551
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,398
Yeah, about bloody time.

552
00:24:57,399 --> 00:24:59,433
I want to use the stones
to confirm his story.

553
00:24:59,434 --> 00:25:01,535
Well, we've never
used the stones inside a star,

554
00:25:01,536 --> 00:25:03,470
and I don't think now
is the time to start it,

555
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:05,472
but I'll tell you what,
you can go talk to yourself

556
00:25:05,473 --> 00:25:06,607
once we're on safely
on the other side.

557
00:25:06,608 --> 00:25:08,142
Safely.

558
00:25:08,143 --> 00:25:10,611
I think now we all need
to be on the bridge.

559
00:25:10,612 --> 00:25:12,313
Oh, well,

560
00:25:12,314 --> 00:25:13,547
at least I'll have someone

561
00:25:13,548 --> 00:25:15,216
To engage in
a decent conversation.

562
00:25:29,731 --> 00:25:31,198
There it is.

563
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:35,135
Well, I think that's
confirmation, don't you?

564
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:36,570
We're altering course
and accelerating.

565
00:25:36,571 --> 00:25:38,672
But we're close enough
to get a decent look at her.

566
00:26:11,706 --> 00:26:14,775
There but for
the grace of God, huh?

567
00:26:14,776 --> 00:26:16,243
It's my fault.

568
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,580
Everybody on that ship

569
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:22,216
died because of me.

570
00:26:22,217 --> 00:26:24,351
Yeah, well, the only reason

571
00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:25,486
we're even in this situation

572
00:26:25,487 --> 00:26:27,788
Is because you were all
trying to save me.

573
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:30,691
Do you guys see what I see?

574
00:26:30,692 --> 00:26:32,192
What?

575
00:26:32,193 --> 00:26:34,862
The damage is confined mostly
to the engineering spaces.

576
00:26:34,863 --> 00:26:36,497
The main living compartments

577
00:26:36,498 --> 00:26:37,431
look intact.

578
00:26:37,432 --> 00:26:38,899
So?

579
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,801
I've got an idea.

580
00:26:43,772 --> 00:26:44,905
Out of the way, out of the way!

581
00:26:44,906 --> 00:26:46,907
Move, move, move!

582
00:26:51,813 --> 00:26:54,214
You just said it was
falling back toward the star.

583
00:26:54,215 --> 00:26:55,683
That was me, actually.

584
00:26:55,684 --> 00:26:57,284
O-okay.

585
00:26:57,285 --> 00:26:59,520
I'm telling you, we need
to get over to that ship.

586
00:26:59,521 --> 00:27:00,954
It might be worth the risk

587
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:02,523
if we can salvage ammunition,
food, supplies...

588
00:27:02,524 --> 00:27:04,892
No, no, that's not
what he's talking about...

589
00:27:04,893 --> 00:27:06,493
Well, what is it, then?

590
00:27:06,494 --> 00:27:09,363
Spare parts.
I had the same idea.

591
00:27:09,364 --> 00:27:10,864
I ran the whole way, too, so...

592
00:27:14,936 --> 00:27:16,737
Hmm.

593
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:17,838
How much time do we have
before we're out of range?

594
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,840
Well, we can't take a shuttle,

595
00:27:19,841 --> 00:27:20,941
the other ship is too close
to the star,

596
00:27:20,942 --> 00:27:22,843
and Destiny is
accelerating away.

597
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:25,245
We can arrange
a short FTL jump,

598
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:26,547
use the Stargate.

599
00:27:26,548 --> 00:27:28,615
It's the same gate.
Can it dial itself?

600
00:27:28,616 --> 00:27:30,718
I don't see why not.

601
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:31,819
Destiny's address
isn't based on

602
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,620
a fixed point in space.

603
00:27:33,621 --> 00:27:34,888
We'll have to input
the distance calculation,

604
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:36,957
but you...

605
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:39,560
Guys should be able
to work that out, right?

606
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:41,695
Yeah, between me,
Eli, and me...

607
00:27:42,964 --> 00:27:44,264
All right, well, let's, uh,

608
00:27:44,265 --> 00:27:45,299
Let's start
putting together a list.

609
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,834
Yeah.

610
00:27:47,836 --> 00:27:49,236
I'd like to lead
the team over there.

611
00:27:49,237 --> 00:27:50,404
I should go as well.

612
00:27:50,405 --> 00:27:51,839
I'm the only one who knows

613
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,273
which systems were affected
by the overload.

614
00:27:53,274 --> 00:27:54,641
Listen, Rush,

615
00:27:54,642 --> 00:27:55,576
I don't even know if that's
what I should call you.

616
00:27:55,577 --> 00:27:56,877
Well, it is my name.

617
00:27:56,878 --> 00:27:57,778
Fine.

618
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:58,946
What I'm trying to say

619
00:27:58,947 --> 00:28:00,447
is that you've been
through hell and back.

620
00:28:00,448 --> 00:28:01,815
You don't got to do this.

621
00:28:01,816 --> 00:28:03,650
The man wants to help,
Everett, let him help.

622
00:28:03,651 --> 00:28:05,853
We're gonna need
all hands for this.

623
00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:13,494
Okay.

624
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,775
These are priority number one!

625
00:28:21,776 --> 00:28:23,510
We want as many as we can
get our hands on.

626
00:28:23,511 --> 00:28:24,544
This one's burned out.

627
00:28:24,545 --> 00:28:25,712
This one is good.

628
00:28:25,713 --> 00:28:26,679
Now, they're in every console,

629
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,114
Power relay,

630
00:28:28,115 --> 00:28:28,882
and pretty much every
piece of equipment

631
00:28:28,883 --> 00:28:30,417
aboard the ship.

632
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:32,385
Open 'em up,
pull 'em out and move on.

633
00:28:32,386 --> 00:28:33,520
What do you call those things?

634
00:28:33,521 --> 00:28:34,721
I don't know,

635
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:36,189
things that make it go.

636
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,257
We should find

637
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:38,658
concentrations of working parts

638
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:40,593
in the bridge,
control interface

639
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,328
and neural interface rooms.

640
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,330
Number two, these things,

641
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:45,632
and don't ask me
what they're called.

642
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:46,766
I'm not even sure
how they work.

643
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,468
We also have to
get our hands on

644
00:28:48,469 --> 00:28:51,504
the other repair robot,
and shield emitter relays.

645
00:28:51,505 --> 00:28:52,672
We'll get
everything on the list.

646
00:28:52,673 --> 00:28:54,140
If there's still time,

647
00:28:54,141 --> 00:28:56,242
we'll move on to our
secondary objectives.

648
00:28:56,243 --> 00:28:57,544
How much time do we have?

649
00:28:57,545 --> 00:28:59,679
We'll assess that
once we're aboard.

650
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,382
Conditions will be difficult
and they will be dangerous,

651
00:29:02,383 --> 00:29:03,883
but make no mistake,

652
00:29:03,884 --> 00:29:06,753
We need to salvage these things
if we are going to survive.

653
00:29:10,858 --> 00:29:13,426
Dial the gate.
Everyone step back.

654
00:29:18,165 --> 00:29:19,199
Send the kino.

655
00:29:32,713 --> 00:29:34,180
It's getting hot already,

656
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:37,317
but the air...
Is still breathable.

657
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:38,952
I'd call it a green light.

658
00:29:38,953 --> 00:29:40,653
Let's move.

659
00:29:41,689 --> 00:29:42,755
Okay, let's go.

660
00:29:42,756 --> 00:29:46,226
Let's move it.

661
00:30:07,882 --> 00:30:09,315
Form into your teams
and stand by.

662
00:30:14,889 --> 00:30:18,591
Okay, I'm reading
power and life support

663
00:30:18,592 --> 00:30:20,527
In both the bridge
and control interface room.

664
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,362
40 minutes
till the shield fails.

665
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:23,663
Then that's the time we have.

666
00:30:23,664 --> 00:30:25,398
Lieutenant,
that means your team

667
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:26,399
heads straight to the armory.

668
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,634
Got it.

669
00:30:27,635 --> 00:30:28,635
You know your assignments, let's
go!

670
00:30:30,504 --> 00:30:31,604
This is Telford.
We are proceeding.

671
00:30:31,605 --> 00:30:32,805
40 minutes on the clock.

672
00:30:32,806 --> 00:30:35,441
Okay, let's go.

673
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:36,543
David, be careful.

674
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,545
Will do.

675
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,701
Someone should report
to home-world command,

676
00:31:01,702 --> 00:31:02,802
explain what's been going on.

677
00:31:02,803 --> 00:31:04,637
Well, you go ahead,

678
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:06,839
and when you're back,
you can explain it to me.

679
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,843
They must think we're all dead.

680
00:31:10,844 --> 00:31:12,645
It didn't happen.

681
00:31:12,646 --> 00:31:13,980
Yeah, it did.

682
00:31:13,981 --> 00:31:15,148
Not to us, Eli...

683
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:16,716
You can say anything you like.

684
00:31:16,717 --> 00:31:19,552
Tell me to take
one time-line at a time,

685
00:31:19,553 --> 00:31:23,823
but if Rush wasn't sent back
by a freak of physics,

686
00:31:23,824 --> 00:31:26,826
we'd all be dead by now.

687
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,702
Move it, come on!

688
00:31:50,317 --> 00:31:51,484
We'll start here.

689
00:31:51,485 --> 00:31:52,885
Let's make this quick.
Spread out.

690
00:31:52,886 --> 00:31:54,687
Over here, guys.

691
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:00,360
Want to try to get
that alarm off?

692
00:32:16,377 --> 00:32:18,411
Start at the back!

693
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,361
Guess we're not going in there.

694
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:59,819
So, this must be
pretty weird for you two, huh?

695
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,920
Yes.

696
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:05,525
Half the ones I'm pulling

697
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:07,093
are burned out
from the overload.

698
00:33:07,094 --> 00:33:09,128
I'll take what we can get.

699
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:10,997
Go get your c02 nodes.
We need to breathe, too.

700
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:15,568
Penhall, you're with me.

701
00:33:17,738 --> 00:33:19,472
That's half time,
start packing it up!

702
00:33:20,908 --> 00:33:23,509
Get back to the Stargate,
quickly as you can.

703
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,745
Go!

704
00:33:27,948 --> 00:33:29,148
Gettin' hot, huh?

705
00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:31,651
Yeah, but it's a dry heat.

706
00:33:40,127 --> 00:33:41,794
All right, that's it,
we're out of here.

707
00:33:41,795 --> 00:33:43,930
Move.

708
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:48,501
Get back to the gate-room. Double
time!

709
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,604
How we doing?

710
00:33:51,605 --> 00:33:53,106
We eat tonight.

711
00:33:53,107 --> 00:33:54,707
Excellent.
Get out of here.

712
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:56,509
Pack it up.

713
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,910
Let's go.

714
00:33:59,847 --> 00:34:02,115
All right, that's it, let's go!

715
00:34:15,462 --> 00:34:16,896
What do you think?

716
00:34:16,897 --> 00:34:18,931
I think it's not on our list.

717
00:34:23,537 --> 00:34:25,738
It could double
the amount of weapons

718
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,707
we could bring online.

719
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:29,208
Do we even have time for this?

720
00:34:29,209 --> 00:34:31,110
Colonel, we've come across
a piece of equipment

721
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,579
that could
significantly increase

722
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,781
Our weapons capability,

723
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:36,048
but we're up against the clock.

724
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:37,083
<i>For that,</i> <i>we should risk it!</i>

725
00:34:37,084 --> 00:34:39,786
For once, he agrees with me.

726
00:34:42,055 --> 00:34:43,990
Okay, I'll go
and I'll bring back

727
00:34:43,991 --> 00:34:45,625
the proper tools.

728
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:46,759
Be careful not to touch
the damaged one.

729
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,961
About a thousand volts
running through that.

730
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,096
Do you think I might know that?

731
00:35:07,614 --> 00:35:08,848
Didn't mean to sneak up on you.

732
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,984
This is it?

733
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,386
Yeah.

734
00:35:13,387 --> 00:35:14,654
The others took the parts we had
back to the gate-room.

735
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:17,056
My younger self
is coming back to help,

736
00:35:17,057 --> 00:35:18,925
but I don't want to
wait for him.

737
00:35:18,926 --> 00:35:20,593
You don't trust
him either, huh?

738
00:35:22,763 --> 00:35:23,896
So, what went wrong?

739
00:35:23,897 --> 00:35:26,199
What are you talking about?

740
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,934
Not that I think you would
kill them all deliberately.

741
00:35:27,935 --> 00:35:29,669
I tried to save them!

742
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,637
You don't think
I buy that story?

743
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:34,040
Rush valiantly keeping
the gate open

744
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:35,775
while the ship explodes
all around him?

745
00:35:35,776 --> 00:35:37,143
I don't care what you think.

746
00:35:37,144 --> 00:35:38,778
It wouldn't be the first time
you sabotaged the ship

747
00:35:38,779 --> 00:35:40,513
to make an ass out of me,
would it?

748
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:41,714
The last time
we tried to dial Earth

749
00:35:41,715 --> 00:35:42,582
from inside a star
comes to mind,

750
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:43,950
among others.

751
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:45,151
So, what went wrong?

752
00:35:45,152 --> 00:35:46,419
The wormhole was unstable!

753
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,887
I'm talking about
what really happened.

754
00:35:47,888 --> 00:35:49,222
Their blood is on your hands,
not mine.

755
00:35:49,223 --> 00:35:51,257
They would all
have made it home,

756
00:35:51,258 --> 00:35:52,491
but you did something!

757
00:35:52,492 --> 00:35:53,926
I was trying
to buy them some time!

758
00:35:53,927 --> 00:35:55,728
Oh, and there's not
a single person left alive

759
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:56,929
to confirm...

760
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:57,964
Get your hands off of me!

761
00:35:57,965 --> 00:35:59,565
You're the coward!

762
00:35:59,566 --> 00:36:00,833
You're the one who didn't
believe in the mission!

763
00:36:00,834 --> 00:36:02,001
You're the one
that killed them!

764
00:36:08,008 --> 00:36:09,609
Oh no...

765
00:36:40,326 --> 00:36:42,060
All right, right over here!

766
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:46,831
Hey, Rush, where's
your other, uh...

767
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:47,365
He's found something
for the weapons systems.

768
00:36:47,366 --> 00:36:48,733
There's no time!

769
00:36:48,734 --> 00:36:50,268
We still have time.
I'm just going back to help.

770
00:36:50,269 --> 00:36:51,536
I'll go with you!

771
00:36:51,537 --> 00:36:54,138
Dial the gate
and keep it open for us.

772
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:56,507
T.J. Get these people
outta here.

773
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:57,508
Don't stay too long!

774
00:36:57,509 --> 00:36:59,143
All right, everybody, move out,

775
00:36:59,144 --> 00:37:01,679
We're going to dial the gate!

776
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,514
They're dialing back.

777
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:05,116
Good.

778
00:37:05,117 --> 00:37:06,985
That was fast.

779
00:37:06,986 --> 00:37:08,086
I wasn't finished reporting,

780
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:09,554
but when colonel Telford
found out

781
00:37:09,555 --> 00:37:10,622
that we were still here,

782
00:37:10,623 --> 00:37:11,990
he insisted

783
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:13,758
that he be allowed
to use the stones

784
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:17,128
to switch with someone,
preferably himself.

785
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:18,196
That's weird.

786
00:37:18,197 --> 00:37:19,364
Yeah, well, that can wait.

787
00:37:19,365 --> 00:37:20,431
At least they know we're alive.

788
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,012
Oh no...

789
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:52,463
Lieutenant Scott,
where the hell are you?

790
00:37:52,464 --> 00:37:54,098
<i>Goin' after something</i>

791
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:55,366
<i>that's supposed to double</i>
<i>the weapons capability, sir.</i>

792
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:57,402
Negative. You don't
have time for that.

793
00:37:57,403 --> 00:37:59,103
I need you to locate
colonel Telford.

794
00:37:59,104 --> 00:38:00,371
He's not answering his radio.

795
00:38:00,372 --> 00:38:01,406
<i>Roger that, sir,</i>

796
00:38:01,407 --> 00:38:03,808
we're comin' right around...

797
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:07,345
Scott, say again?
You were cut off.

798
00:38:07,346 --> 00:38:09,480
We found the colonel, sir.

799
00:38:09,481 --> 00:38:11,349
He's dead.

800
00:38:16,722 --> 00:38:17,722
Where's Rush?

801
00:38:17,723 --> 00:38:19,624
He's right beside me.

802
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:21,392
I don't know where
the other one is.

803
00:38:21,393 --> 00:38:22,460
I do.

804
00:38:23,796 --> 00:38:24,729
Hey, hey, Rush!

805
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:28,633
Sir, Rush just ran off on me.

806
00:38:28,634 --> 00:38:29,567
Let him go.

807
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:31,135
<i>Sir!</i>

808
00:38:31,136 --> 00:38:32,570
You only have a few minutes
before the shield fails.

809
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:34,439
Let him go,
that is an order, lieutenant.

810
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:58,363
It was an accident.

811
00:38:58,364 --> 00:39:03,101
I believe you,

812
00:39:03,102 --> 00:39:04,102
but they won't.

813
00:39:04,103 --> 00:39:06,804
No.

814
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,844
Tell me, when you, uh,
dialed Earth...

815
00:39:12,845 --> 00:39:14,779
what really happened?

816
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:18,716
I told you what happened.

817
00:39:22,388 --> 00:39:24,789
And so now you're...

818
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,823
trying to decide

819
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:27,892
whether or not
to sit in that chair.

820
00:39:27,893 --> 00:39:29,160
Well, wouldn't you in my place?

821
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,897
I'm not sure if even
the knowledge of the ancients

822
00:39:32,898 --> 00:39:34,332
can help you now.

823
00:39:36,902 --> 00:39:38,736
Well, I really don't have
anything to lose

824
00:39:38,737 --> 00:39:41,873
at this point.

825
00:39:41,874 --> 00:39:45,243
Imagine what I could learn.

826
00:39:45,244 --> 00:39:46,411
Well, you won't have much time.

827
00:39:46,412 --> 00:39:48,613
Well, time's relative.

828
00:39:48,614 --> 00:39:51,849
We've just proved
that, haven't we?

829
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,218
So, what are you waiting for?

830
00:39:56,488 --> 00:39:58,923
I need your help.

831
00:40:19,278 --> 00:40:21,179
Thank you.

832
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,613
Good bye.

833
00:40:59,218 --> 00:41:00,318
Come on, come on, come on!

834
00:41:20,572 --> 00:41:22,240
You're welcome.

835
00:41:24,676 --> 00:41:26,511
I'm okay, I'm okay.

836
00:41:29,515 --> 00:41:31,449
Nicholas...

837
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,950
Yeah?

838
00:41:34,486 --> 00:41:37,221
Where's the other Rush?

839
00:41:37,222 --> 00:41:38,589
I don't know.

840
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,324
You told Scott
you knew where he went.

841
00:41:40,325 --> 00:41:41,526
I was wrong.

842
00:41:41,527 --> 00:41:43,194
I went looking for him,
couldn't find him.

843
00:41:43,195 --> 00:41:45,363
Maybe he decided
to go down with his ship.

844
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:47,465
That doesn't sound like me.

845
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:48,733
Still, you must, uh,

846
00:41:48,734 --> 00:41:50,568
you must be pleased
about one thing.

847
00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:52,637
What's that?

848
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:55,406
Well, we can fix the ship,
get on with the mission.

849
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,644
Yeah, of course.

850
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:06,617
Get on with the mission.
