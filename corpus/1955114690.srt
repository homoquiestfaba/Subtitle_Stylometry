1
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,963
<i>All units to 16th and H street,
Lafayette Hotel.</i>

2
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,321
<i>Proceed north to Lafayette square.</i>

3
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,046
<i>Ten-four, we're on our way.
ETA, 10 minutes.</i>

4
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,527
<i>We have reports of gunfire
at Lafayette Hotel.</i>

5
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,931
<i>Air units dispatched
en route the scene. Over.</i>

6
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,488
<i>Need Homeland security clearance.
Heading right over the White House.</i>

7
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,685
<i>105 North Avenue, 52.</i>

8
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,327
Get her out of here. Move, move.
Step back.

9
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,210
Go, go, go!

10
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,131
Storm that hotel! Move! Move!

11
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,482
<i>Aerial unit, flying over
restricted area.</i>

12
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,160
<i>Will need Homeland security
clearance.</i>

13
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,523
<i>Right. We're checking into that.
Stand by.</i>

14
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,563
- Yeah.
<i>- SWAT team in position.</i>

15
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,728
<i>Perimeter secured.</i>

16
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,570
Just crossing
Maryland Avenue now.

17
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,331
<i>Yes, sir. We're ready for you.
Over and out.</i>

18
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,600
<i>We are right across the street
from the White House...</i>

19
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,043
<i>...and the hotel stand off continues.</i>

20
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,449
Unfortunately, with no new reports
from authorities...

21
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,326
...who still decline to identify
the hostages...

22
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,320
Keep the reporters back before
I instruct my men to shoot them.

23
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,127
Is she still alive?

24
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,163
They have her on the phone
with a negotiator.

25
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,249
- She's relaying demands.
- The other hostages?

26
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,647
She's the only one.
They cleared everybody else out.

27
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,842
I moved them to the basement
when the press came.

28
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,041
Good. What about our men?

29
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,608
According to one of the waiters,
they're all dead.

30
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,166
- Get the SWAT team ready.
- Okay.

31
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,970
The executive dining room main door
is on the second floor landing.

32
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,481
I want every exit covered.
Every window, every door.

33
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,889
Done, sir. Your associate,
Mr. Mandela, gave the orders.

34
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,686
- Mandela?
- Yes, sir.

35
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,843
- Oh, fuck.
- Hold on a minute.

36
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,850
- Darryl boy, have a seat.
- Mr. Mandela?

37
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,407
- That was a funny bit, huh?
- Yeah, real funny.

38
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,649
- What are you doing here, Brooks?
- I was just in the neighbourhood.

39
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,205
Thought you could use some help.

40
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,127
You have really overstepped
your bounds this time.

41
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,810
Your team doesn't belong here.

42
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,368
In fact, if I had anything to say about it,
your team wouldn't belong anywhere.

43
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,766
It wouldn't exist.

44
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,406
Now, get your crazy bunch of lunatics
out of my--

45
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,967
He's made it into the basement.
Where now?

46
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,766
- To the left, above the garbage can.
- You hear that?

47
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,928
<i>Copy that.</i>

48
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,691
- I'm sorry, you were saying?
- Who is this?

49
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,491
Darryl, this is Carlos.
Carlos is a waiter.

50
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,968
He knows the ins and outs
of the banquet hall kitchen.

51
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,210
Carlos, this is Darryl Greene.
He's head of the Secret Service.

52
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,564
He's in charge of all of those
dead agents inside.

53
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,284
- Dining room door, now.
- I wouldn't storm the door, Darryl.

54
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,845
Move, move, move!

55
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,080
The bad guys say they put explosives
at all the entrances and exits.

56
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,567
You two, take the left.
You, come with me, now.

57
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,171
Bullshit. They'd kill themselves.

58
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,160
Good point. Good point.
But if you're wrong...

59
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,489
...well, one, you're just gonna kill
more of your men...

60
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,411
...which I know you don't give
a flying fuck about.

61
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,602
But two...

62
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
...you are gonna guarantee
one hell of a funeral...

63
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,200
...down Pennsylvania Avenue.

64
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,322
Now, I, for one, would not want to be
the head cowboy in charge...

65
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,091
...that went and blowed up
the president's wife.

66
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,931
<i>- Entering basement.</i>
- Okay, I got you.

67
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,122
My team's ready.

68
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,689
- Who's on your team?
- Just Connors.

69
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,848
- Jesus Christ.
- No, he wasn't available.

70
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,849
You're fucking team is a disaster,
Brooks.

71
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,929
You make more problems
than you solve.

72
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,606
I'm waiting.

73
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,921
You fuck this up,
I'll really have your ass.

74
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,090
Ten minutes, you smug bastard.
That's it.

75
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,361
- You're up, partner.
<i>-See you in a few minutes, Billy.</i>

76
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,211
We have a 10-point
emergency action plan for America.

77
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,925
They want to broadcast.

78
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,681
They've sent this by e-mail to all the
major networks and cable outlets.

79
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,205
Their manifesto must be read live
tonight on the evening news.

80
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,289
Bobby.

81
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,404
The money must be transferred
to this bank account.

82
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,321
- Dinner, what's taking so long?
- I'll go check on it.

83
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,320
--NCC-202.

84
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,205
- The password is "protagonist."
- Bobby?

85
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,926
- That's right. Protagonist.
- Champagne.

86
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,283
- They expect confirmation in one hour.
- And make it a good one.

87
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,281
Let's go, people, let's go. Hurry up.

88
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,608
How's it going, Wolfgang?

89
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,088
Hurry up. Let's move!

90
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,362
This looks tasty.

91
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,443
Tasty.

92
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,171
Tasty. Hurry up.
Let's move, people!

93
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,045
You. Champagne?

94
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,447
It's at the entrance.

95
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,000
- This a good one?
- I'm a Henny man myself.

96
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,610
You stay here. I'll take that.

97
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,003
Hey.

98
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,804
Where'd you come from?

99
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,686
At the door.

100
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,844
He just told me to bring out the food.
I don't want no problems.

101
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,805
Gentlemen.

102
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,047
Come.

103
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,249
If it wasn't for the unfortunate
interference of your Secret Service...

104
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,683
...you'd be safely home by now,
Barbara.

105
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,611
I expect we'll be here
a few more hours...

106
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,725
...and we did interrupt
before dinner was served.

107
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,404
Chicken or fish?

108
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,650
Oh, I'm sorry.

109
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,287
Is it too presumptuous of me
to call the first lady by her first name?

110
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,051
I don't know how you think
you could ever get away with this.

111
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,087
I don't expect to get away.
I expect to be heard.

112
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,887
This operation is about
making a statement.

113
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,162
One we're all prepared to die for.

114
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,003
You see, some people have principles,
unlike the gang of trash...

115
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,885
...that currently holds
the reigns of power in this city.

116
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,048
Champagne?

117
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,968
While your husband and the rest
of the government fiddles...

118
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,011
...this country is burning.

119
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,487
Someone has to put out the flames.

120
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,728
The Army of Patriots will.

121
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,441
Well, give me the damn bottle.

122
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,329
This does not bode well for your tip,
my friend.

123
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,566
- Move, move!
- Greene.

124
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,970
Get down! There!

125
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,642
- Greene.
- Keep him off my ass.

126
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,046
Greene.

127
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,326
Drop your fucking weapons,
or I'll slit Barbara's throat.

128
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,762
Drop them!

129
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,881
- Enemy neutralized. Stand down.
- Stop!

130
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,211
- No! Do not enter!
- Fuck.

131
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,164
Do not open the door!

132
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,691
No! No!

133
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,844
Yeah.

134
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,731
Fuck. I'm coming!

135
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,441
Yeah, yeah.

136
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,688
What?

137
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,843
- What do you want, Howard?
- How do you always know it's me?

138
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,725
Because I can smell your
skanky-ass breath. What time is it?

139
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,331
Around 5.

140
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,887
- Which 5?
- The one before <i>Jeopardy!</i>

141
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,526
Listen, Debbie's going out
for groceries. You need...

142
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,769
-...any of these cigars you smoke?
- Yeah, and a six-pack.

143
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,042
Hey, later on,
having a little barbecue.

144
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,527
You know, a piece of salmon,
a little tofu...

145
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,166
...a little Crosby, Stills,
Nash and Young.

146
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,408
I know you're not a sociable guy,
but maybe you--

147
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,250
- Here.
- No, I'll get this one, eh.

148
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,522
Look, I don't need your charity,
you fucking gimp.

149
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,007
- Just take the money.
- You don't need charity, Connors.

150
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,806
- You need a fucking psychiatrist.
- Fuck you, cracker.

151
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,731
- Fuck you, homeboy.
- Eat shit.

152
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,287
That's very mature.
Give me the money.

153
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,403
Give me the goddamn money.
I'll get the cigars.

154
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,807
- Now you want the money.
- Yeah.

155
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,485
- You want any fruit or anything?
- No, just go. Go.

156
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,807
<i>Thank you, Johnny. Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

157
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,001
<i>Yes, it's easy money.</i>

158
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,487
<i>Charlie Lincoln and I are here
to give away money.</i>

159
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,091
<i>I've got a wonderful--</i>

160
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,760
<i>Roberto Tomas, quite a fight but
sonic Tangler laying back.</i>

161
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,851
<i>There's a left hook right now,
followed by a right jab in there.</i>

162
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,771
<i>Tangler's starting to put
a little pressure now on Tomas.</i>

163
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,962
<i>A right, another left,
a fury of fighting--</i>

164
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,970
<i>- Hit hard, hit hard.
- This is starting to look incredible. I--</i>

165
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,208
<i>G stocks extended their gain
Wednesday...</i>

166
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,801
<i>...amid positive views
on the sector from Wall street.</i>

167
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,649
Are you excited about
the new room?

168
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,128
Yeah. Where is it?

169
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,244
Marco.

170
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,124
Polo.

171
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,809
Still walking around
jingling that change in your pocket.

172
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,287
Fucking loser.

173
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,404
Yeah, I gotta know it's there.

174
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,001
So, what's popping?

175
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,407
Yeah, partner.

176
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,566
Just chilling on the back
of your pimping houseboat...

177
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,966
...on a weekday, huh?

178
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,049
You know me, it is what it is.

179
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,642
Fresh air, sea breeze.

180
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,365
I'll bet you get a hell of a view
once the fog lifts, huh?

181
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,685
Blind man with a view.
You got jokes.

182
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,962
What is you doing out
on the coast anyway?

183
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,525
I thought you hate the water.

184
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,810
I came to see you, asshole.

185
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,851
Your cell phone's terminated.

186
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,642
You won't answer my damn letters.

187
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,083
What do you expect from me?

188
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,363
I'm a busy man. You know,
with all this chilling and all.

189
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,966
How long has it been?

190
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,130
How long?

191
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,010
About a long two years, huh?

192
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,525
So how's business?

193
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,961
The fact is, that's why I'm here.

194
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,685
I got a gig for you.

195
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,089
The president's chauffeur.
Holler at your boy. When do I start?

196
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,964
Come on, man. This is a good gig.

197
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,367
This will get you right back up
in the loop.

198
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,291
Look here, Billy man, don't come
down here playing with me like that.

199
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,004
I swear on everything I'll break your
legs and throw you in that fucking bay.

200
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,161
Same old Warren Connors, huh?

201
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,684
Same old little punk-ass,
East St. Louis crackhead.

202
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,530
Sitting in the brig,
all fierce and mean.

203
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,203
But I could see then and there,
all your potential.

204
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,603
You remember what I said?

205
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,126
You remember I told you
you got a choice?

206
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,002
I said, you could fuck up your life.
Go back to the projects.

207
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,204
Go to jail. Maybe take a bullet...

208
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,850
...and die in some rat-infested,
nasty-ass prison hospital.

209
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,930
Or...

210
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,931
...you could come
and work with me...

211
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,841
...and be somebody.
Do something for your country.

212
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,442
"Do something for your country."
Is that what we were doing, Billy?

213
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,360
You damn straight.

214
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,044
Gotta wonder about that one.

215
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,322
Damn, partner...

216
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,406
...sound to me like you've been
doing some heavy thinking...

217
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,931
...since you've been chilling.

218
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,283
Soldiers don't ask questions.
They just do or die.

219
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,482
They do or die
because they believe in something.

220
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,083
Not that bullshit, flag-waving,
Chinese proverb shit.

221
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,281
Come on, man.

222
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,561
Well, don't do it for me.

223
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,969
Do it for yourself.
You believe in that, don't you?

224
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,128
Come on, man.

225
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,568
I gotta have you back.

226
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,683
And you could use a gig.

227
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,201
Even if I wanted to do it...

228
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,082
...do you see
what you looking at?

229
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,362
I'm blind as a bat, dogs.

230
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,927
Well, what if I was to tell you...

231
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,203
...if you come with me, right now...

232
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,844
...I have a way
of getting your eyesight back.

233
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,689
All of it.

234
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,884
Still wanna throw me in the bay?

235
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,640
Yeah. About a month ago...

236
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,365
...I was called into the West Wing.

237
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,767
The old man gave me six months.

238
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,931
They're closing down my unit.

239
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,006
- Darryl Greene?
- Who else?

240
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,406
Motherfucker.

241
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,205
He finally convinced the president
I was too much of a loose cannon...

242
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,086
...for their post-Cold War,
"we're the good guys" paradigm.

243
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,089
Got this drone satellite.

244
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,610
Damn thing can track,
pinpoint and destroy a fly...

245
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,882
...from a thousand miles in space.

246
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,128
They think they don't need
human beings anymore.

247
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,369
Guess I feel sorry for you, O.G.

248
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,969
Then don't be.

249
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,323
Because tonight...

250
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,601
...you will sneak into the Mountain
and steal the brain to their little toy.

251
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,961
I'm gonna do what?

252
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,807
Just for a day, okay?

253
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,164
One 24-hour period, then I'm gonna
bring it back to the president myself.

254
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,087
He gonna see right then and there
why you can't replace old Brooks.

255
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,169
Jesus Christ, Billy,
how am I supposed to--?

256
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,523
Dude, you're stealing their
security computer, and tonight...

257
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,802
...you're gonna have
your sight back.

258
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,004
And that asshole
who fucked over you and me...

259
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,489
...that son of a bitch is gonna be
pushing papers in some desk job...

260
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,002
...in Uzbekistan, because it's payback
time for Greenie, I'm telling you.

261
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,928
You remember <i>The Art of War,</i>
chapter two?

262
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,762
Turn the first defeat...

263
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,201
-...into the final victory.
- Into the final victory.

264
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,761
Where are we?

265
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,407
Old farmhouse about a half-hour
east of the mountain.

266
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,250
Oh, we way under radar, huh?

267
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,249
Yeah, but we'll be all right.

268
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,209
You got it? You good?

269
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,690
Watch your step, son
you got about just a few left.

270
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,089
Three, two-- Just a few more.

271
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,886
- Three, two-- One more.
- Here we are.

272
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,084
- Okay, you're up. Doc.
- Hi.

273
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,920
Lead the man--
Get comfortable in the chair, please.

274
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,010
All right. Now, watch yourself.
There's a chair right there.

275
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,043
Hold that.

276
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,569
We're moving an instrument
in front of you now.

277
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,930
This is Dr. Lucas Mackenzie.

278
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,683
He's been in micro-ocular surgery
and medicine for over 50 years...

279
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,008
...and he knows
what he's doing, okay?

280
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,690
He's gonna take a look at your eyes.

281
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,770
- Mighty soft hands, doc.
- That's his colleague.

282
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,883
Hello, colleague.

283
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,764
Mr. Connors.

284
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,806
Easy, partner.

285
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,843
Just wanted to get to know
how she looked.

286
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,006
- Nothing personal.
- So, what's the story, doc?

287
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,002
Exactly as his file reads.

288
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,841
The retina is fused to the inner lining
of the ganglion nerve.

289
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,202
- And as--
- English, doc, please?

290
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,130
Your subject should work perfectly.

291
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,484
All right. Did you hear that?

292
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,843
Now, do you wanna get
your sight back, partner?

293
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,884
Because if you do,
you gotta make a decision right now.

294
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,368
No, I ain't scared of nothing.

295
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,086
- Fuck it. Let's do it.
- My man.

296
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,123
Okay, doc, let's rock.

297
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,525
If you don't mind me asking, doc,
what's the deal?

298
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,888
Ms. Halden, can you explain
about the tapetum?

299
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,409
Mr. Connors, do you know
why some animals like rabbits...

300
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,604
-...see differently than humans?
- Got me.

301
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,404
Because they have
what's called tapetum.

302
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,920
Which is kind of like a mirror
that lies behind the retina.

303
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,562
It amplifies
all the available light.

304
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,564
It's what makes their eyes glow when
we shine a light on them in the dark.

305
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,362
Now, Dr. Mackenzie here
has developed a synthetic tapetum...

306
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,881
...which we're going to inject
directly into your eyes.

307
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,447
The military was interested in this
for night vision.

308
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,689
But someone with normal eyesight
can't absorb the serum.

309
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,120
Their body just rejects it.

310
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,764
So the subject has to be someone
with a non-functioning ocular system.

311
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,964
Oh, let me guess,
so I'm the lucky guinea pig.

312
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,290
Well, not exactly.

313
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,767
There were Larry, Curly and Moe.

314
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,686
Three blind mice.

315
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,685
Not anymore.

316
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,360
Okay, this is going to numb
your eyes...

317
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,808
...so you don't feel a thing.

318
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,729
This is a mechanical syringe.

319
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,765
It injects the serum
directly into your eyes.

320
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,124
We call it the pitchfork.

321
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,085
That's very comforting, doc.

322
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,362
Are you ready, Mr. Connors?

323
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,482
We gotta go, partner.

324
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,920
Let's go.

325
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,127
Both eyes lined up and ready to go.

326
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,687
Let's do the damn thing.

327
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,730
Done.

328
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,325
Done?

329
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,649
- Doc, I can't see shit.
- Well, it takes some time...

330
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,731
...for the anaesthetic to wear off and
the artificial tapetum to integrate itself.

331
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,605
We can't wait around here for that.
We gotta get out of here.

332
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,168
- If you say so.
- All right.

333
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,644
At 5, the Mountain's getting
an upgrade to its power grid.

334
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,891
The whole place will temporarily go
offline and on to the backup system.

335
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,044
So I take out the backup
and all the lights go out.

336
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,971
That's right.
The electrical is on I-Level.

337
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,926
Now, dig it.
The drone brain is on G-Level.

338
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,124
Now, I know you don't have
clearance for that, but you got moves.

339
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,962
It's in locker number 605
and it's kept on ice.

340
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,725
All right?

341
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,522
Oh, yeah, it's getting to be
about that time, partner.

342
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,202
Let's see if this partnership
is still on track.

343
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,802
Look, I don't care about
your little war with Darryl Greene.

344
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,206
I get my vision back...

345
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,131
...this one job...

346
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,924
...and I'm done.

347
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,170
Deal.

348
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,408
Oh, you gonna do
the honours yourself?

349
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,640
Well?

350
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,851
- Oh, my God.
- What?

351
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,124
I forgot how ugly you were.

352
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,320
Okay, now, dig it.
You'll use the Jeep to enter.

353
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,205
And I'll meet you
back outside the gate.

354
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,561
All right?

355
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,810
Now, I got your ID,
I got a change of clothes...

356
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,411
...I got your 9 mm.

357
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,125
I'm not gonna need that.

358
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,607
I'm not killing nobody
over no damn laptop.

359
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,643
Now, don't go pussy on me, partner.

360
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,251
These dudes don't play.

361
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,246
They ain't gonna invite you for tea
if they catch your ass.

362
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,930
I know the drill. I'm on my own.

363
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,131
All right.

364
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,405
Well, you got your assorted
break-and-enter equipment...

365
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,168
...and the star scope goggles.

366
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,291
Which will give you
a double advantage in the dark.

367
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,571
What? What's wrong?

368
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,209
What's wrong?

369
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,845
Oh, shit.

370
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,364
What's wrong, damn it?

371
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,203
Billy, I ain't gonna need
those goggles.

372
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,202
<i>Main gate, we have a car
approaching. Check it out.</i>

373
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,765
All right, sir. Go ahead.

374
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,721
Yes, hold on, I'll transfer you.

375
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,804
We're at the one-and-a-half-hour
mark, sir.

376
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,331
Thank you, major.

377
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,808
G-Section,
authorized personnel only.

378
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,161
Can I see your badge, sir?

379
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,570
All right.

380
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,162
- You all right there, buddy?
- Yeah, yeah.

381
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,362
It's just these new contacts
is killing me.

382
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,843
You know, my wife got that
laser surgery.

383
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,326
She swears by it.

384
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,281
Oh, all right. Yeah,
I'll keep that in mind. Thanks.

385
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,687
Oh, shit.

386
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,921
No. Not fucking now.

387
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,130
<i>All personnel review final procedures

388

389
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,850
<i>Two hours to upgrade procedure.</i>

390
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,001
<i>It is now two hours

391
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,008
Oil refineries in the bottom--

392
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,690
Enter.

393
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,531
Yeah?

394
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,324
Grid goes off-line in 15, sir.

395
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,249
- Backup systems checked?
- Yes, sir.

396
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,965
Carry on, major.

397
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,965
As I was saying, the oil refineries
in the bottom left...

398
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,764
...would be our primary target.

399
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,565
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

400
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,807
Get on the radio.

401
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,844
Why aren't the backup systems
kicking in?

402
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,566
Sergeant, we need someone
down at I-Level immediately.

403
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,683
Here you go, general.

413
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,125
This is section G. Please come in.

We have a Code 16.
I repeat, Code 16.

415
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,968
We have a Code 16.

416
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,321
We're in total darkness.

419
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,128

an accident, general.

420
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,166
<i>This is section G. Please come in.</i>

421
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,642
- Yeah?
<i>- Got a break-in in the Armoury.</i>

422
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,447
<i>- Locker 605.</i>
- What's in 605?

423
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,291
I want this place shut down!
Now! Move it!

424
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,810

<i>We have a code red.</i>

431
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,571
Hold on!

432
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,289
- You talking to me?
- Yes, sir.

433
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,051
We got orders to close down the base.
You'll have to go back.

434
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,041
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Me too.

435
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,930
That's him! Over there!

436
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,924
The guy in the car!

437
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,611
Halt!

438
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,571
Halt, or we fire!

439
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,401
And fire!

440
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,206
Oh, shit!

441
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,724
<i>We're going in for a closer look.</i>

442
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,922
We're approaching
the vehicle now.

443
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,600
Doesn't seem to be
anybody inside.

444
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,926
Nope, nobody's inside the vehicle.

445
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,607
- Marco?
- Oh, fuck you.

446
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,171
Yeah, but you got it, didn't you?

447
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,561
Fuck!

448
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,249
Fuck! Fuck!

449
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,920
Fuck!

450
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,528
Hold still, Mr. Connors.

451
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,168
What the fuck did y'all give me, man?
My head feels like it's exploding.

452
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,047
Seems to be an adverse reaction
to the tapetum.

453
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,481
There's always the possibility
of side effects.

454
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,684
Side effects? What the fuck
you telling me about side effects now?

455
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,804
Oh, stop whining, Connors.
You wanted to see.

456
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,526
- So you got a little headache.
- Fuck you, too, Brooks.

457
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,245
Hold on, Mr. Connors.

458
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,489
We're going to extract the serum.
That should relieve the pain. Amanda?

459
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,842
Mr. Connors, sit back.
Try and relax, all right?

460
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,042
The extraction process
is more complicated...

461
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,324
...so we're gonna give you a general
anaesthetic and knock you out.

462
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,443
Oh, yeah.

463
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,210
Just take this pain away.

464
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,287
Ten, nine...

465
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,962
...eight, seven...

466
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,644
...six, five, four...

467
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,730
Ms. Halden?

468
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,921
How did you know it was me?

469
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,080
I don't wear cheap perfume.

470
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,440
I guess you're feeling better.

471
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,648
Yeah. I'm all right.

472
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,970
- What time is it?
-It's about 1:00.

473
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,286
Which 1?

474
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,767
The one around lunch,
which is what I'm trying to fix.

475
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,201
But it's quite the challenge
in this kitchen.

476
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,526
How did we get here?

477
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,688
Brooks dropped us off
about three hours ago.

478
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,928
I told him I'd stay till
the anaesthesia wore off.

479
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,725
- Headache's gone?
- Pretty much.

480
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,604
- Mind if I take a look?
- Be my guest.

481
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,165
How long before
headaches started?

482
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,567
About five, six hours.

483
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,009
Then, like, my vision
kept going in and out.

484
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,442
- How well could you see before that?
- Look...

485
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,770
...that serum didn't just
enhance my vision, it magnified it.

486
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,644
Colours got deeper.

487
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,001
Lights got sharper.

488
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,811
I could see in pitch black.

489
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,730
I could spot a golf ball from
a mile away and tell you the brand.

490
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,442
- So the serum worked.
- Damn straight, it worked.

491
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,007
Only thing is your guinea pig
can't see shit in light...

492
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,806
...and my head felt like it was
about to explode or something.

493
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,321
Look, we'll work
on the headaches. Okay?

494
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,087
I don't think there's anything we can
do about your sensitivity to the light.

495
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,363
The infrared rays from the sun just
aren't synthesizing with the serum.

496
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,085
Put your head back.

497
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,884
Maybe there's some kind of headgear
or something we can develop...

498
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,048
...to diminish the intensity.

499
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,571
Say word.

500
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,240
Like I get some type of cape,
fancy car with it too?

501
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,681
I bet you would just love
a theme song, wouldn't you?

502
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,040
See?

503
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,526
Oh, wait.

504
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,961
I know I just didn't detect
a little sense of humour.

505
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,087
I know Ms. Halden didn't just come up
with a little funny or something.

506
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,441
It's been known to happen.

507
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,201
You know what?

508
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,767
I bet those cute brown eyes
get even sexier...

509
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,203
...and nicer when you smile.

510
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,765
How do you know
I have brown eyes?

511
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,960
Snuck a peek after you drugged me
and took advantage of me.

512
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,562
Mr. Connors, I wouldn't need any
anaesthesia to knock you out again.

513
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,368
You're supposed to be a healer,
not a fighter.

514
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,891
You're supposed to comfort me.

515
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,001
What about that
doctor-patient relationship?

516
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,924
Isn't there some oath
to go with that?

517
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,922
I had a life before medical school,
Mr. Connors.

518
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,170
On the South Side of Chicago...

519
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,930
...the sisters got their own oath.

520
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,365
- You want a piece of that?
- Chi-town.

521
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,891
I don't want no drama.

522
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,050
Hell, no. Saved by the bell.

523
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,688
Let me get up until
something pop off.

524
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,970
Howard, Howard, Howard.

525
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,165
How did you know it was me
this time? I brushed, I flo--

526
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,083
- What?
- Well.

527
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,169
- Well, what?
- Well, well, well.

528
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,843
Does the Conster have himself
some female companionship today?

529
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,850
- Howard, could you haul ass?
- Hey, no judgment.

530
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,123
Free love. That's what it was
all about in my day.

531
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,243
You're a pathetic,
dirty old man, you know?

532
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:15,450
Yeah, listen. My TV is on the fritz
and I just rented <i>Yellow submarine.</i>

533
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,926
What's that have to do with me?

534
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,604
Oh, well, I thought
I could borrow yours.

535
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,371
It's not like you're watching it
or anything right now.

536
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,369
Okay, okay. Later, later. Not now.

537
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,722
Yeah, later, later.
Just give me a call...

538
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,845
...when it's free and clear
down here at the love shack.

539
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,168
You know, you're a
piece of work, Howard.

540
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,451
- So how do you like your eggs?
- Sunny-side up.

541
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,209
Too late. How about scrambled?

542
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,447
Oh, damn.

543
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,848
You know, Dr. Mackenzie
wanted me to apologize.

544
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,284
We should have let you know there
could be side effects to the serum.

545
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,124
Forget about it.
I mean, it is what it is.

546
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,651
Actually, it was pretty shitty.

547
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,922
But sometimes we get
so close to the project...

548
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,805
...we forget that we're actually
dealing with real people.

549
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,241
Look, if you hadn't been so caught up
on your work...

550
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,761
...I'd never have the opportunity
to have my sight back.

551
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,525
You don't know how much
that means.

552
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:14,128
Well, we're gonna learn how
to do it better and without side effects.

553
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,924
That is, if you're willing
to continue...

554
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,130
You know, continue to be...

555
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,321
Being your guinea pig?

556
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,289
- Yeah, basically.
- I ain't got nothing to lose, baby.

557
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,641
I'm a rider.

558
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,925
Good. Now all we have to do
is secure the funding.

559
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,724
What about Brooks?

560
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,571
- Our work with Brooks is done.
- Done?

561
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,888
- Yeah.
- Don't you work for the agency?

562
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,766
No. When the new administration
came in, they cut us loose.

563
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,081
We tried to hustle some money
from private investors...

564
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,611
...but we had no takers.

565
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,086
Until Brooks came along.

566
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,966
He knew our work, secured the
funding, and brought us in for this job.

567
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,811
And maybe, if your mission
was a success last night...

568
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,163
...you can actually convince him
to continue funding the project.

569
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,408
Well, we should know pretty soon.

570
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,524
Brooks should be handing the brain
to the president as we speak.

571
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,362
- Brain?
- Yeah. See...

572
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:09,565
...our little mission last night
was basically to save Brooks' project.

573
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,000
We sort of kind of...

574
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,728
...borrowed this hard drive.

575
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,844
Funny piece of equipment
for a hard drive.

576
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,481
- You saw it?
- Yeah.

577
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,809
While I diffused serum in your head,
Brooks took it out of the bag.

578
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,205
It looked more like a thermos
than a hard drive.

579
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,801
- A thermos?
- Yeah.

580
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,322
It was about that big...

581
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,569
...and stainless steel.

582
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,767
What?

583
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,885
- What?
- Peek outside.

584
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,320
- Peek outside?
- Peek outside.

585
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,205
All right.

586
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,084
- I'm peeking outside.
- What do you see?

587
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,369
"What do I see?"
I see a houseboat.

588
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,201
I see a guy in a boat kind of throwing
some water out with a bucket.

589
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,004
No, no, no.
Over by the bridge.

590
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,206
- What do you see?
- Nothing.

591
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,120
There's two guys on the bridge.

592
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,765
Two--? What they got on?

593
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,281
- What do you mean?
- What are they wearing?

594
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,370
Dark glasses, dark suits.

595
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,530
Those are Greene's men.
Get away from that window.

596
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,404
Wait a minute. What's going on?

597
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,444
I think something's gone wrong.
Those are agency men.

598
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,880
They're staking out the place.

599
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,806
- We got five minutes, if that long.
- Five minutes for what?

600
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,482
- What the hell is that?
- This is my bodyguard. Let's go.

601
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,041
I'm not going until you explain to me
what's going on.

602
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,846
We don't have time for that.
Let's go.

603
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,451
Mr. Connors, you are blind...

604
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,041
...you got God knows
what arsenal in your crotch...

605
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,607
...and you want me to
lead you around? I deserve answers.

606
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,802
Look, Amanda,
you gotta trust me right now.

607
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,162
Those men are here to kill us.
They got a hit on us.

608
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,441
Let's go.

609
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,891
Okay.

610
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,291
Go around.

611
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,890
Howard, I need a favour. Your ride.

612
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,885
- What?
- Give me the damn keys!

613
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,646
Yeah. I always knew
there was more to you...

614
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,287
...than just a blind dude
with a rotten attitude.

615
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,447
Here.

616
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,961
Federal agents!

617
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,365
Come out!

618
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,802
Hey, Connors!

619
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,367
You be careful with her.

620
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,767
She's a classic.

621
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,885
Get down.

622
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,080
Jesus Christ.

623
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,730
Yes, Mr. President?

624
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,325
- Mr. President?
<i>- Guess again, Greene.</i>

625
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,047
Connors.

626
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,003
Don't say nothing. I got a couple
of things I need to know.

627
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,929
<i>That was some stunt
you and Brooks pulled.</i>

628
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,691
<i>- Tell me, how does a blind man--?</i>
- Look, don't say nothing.

629
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,803
I'm asking the questions.

630
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,809
Does Brooks still work
for the agency?

631
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,241
Like you don't fucking know.

632
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,120
Jesus Christ, you don't know.

633
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,165
When the new administration came in,
Brooks' department wasn't necessary.

634
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,010
We fired him about six months ago.

635
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,566
<i>What did you think?</i>

636
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,683
<i>You didn't work
for the U.S. Government...</i>

637
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,609
...you worked for Brooks,
private citizen.

638
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,690
Now he's in D.C. trying to
blackmail us with the shit you stole.

639
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,806
- Is the thermos what I think it is?
- Why should I tell you anything?

640
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,731
Because I'm the best chance
of you getting it back.

641
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,649
Is the thermos CMC-12?

642
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,491
Yes. I'm telling you, Connors,
your man's nuts.

643
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,211
He went crazy when we fired him.

644
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,050
All kinds of threats, accusations.

645
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,844
What did you think
was gonna happen?

646
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,883
That job was his whole fucking life.

647
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,043
Well, now his whole life
is all fucked up.

648
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,961
The man is a criminal,
he's dangerous.

649
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,323
He has a vendetta against me and the
whole country and you've helped him.

650
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,682
No, no, no.
He wouldn't do nothing like that.

651
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,120
Nothing.

652
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,250
Unless...

653
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,766
You were taking him out?

654
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,044
You got an executive order,
didn't you?

655
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,850
Fuck you. Assassinations are
against the law in this country--

656
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,202
<i>Wait. What did he threaten,
to go to the press?</i>

657
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,769
To release all y'all dirty laundry
to get his job back?

658
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,248
<i>No. You wouldn't go for that.</i>

659
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,046
You went to the president
and got an executive order?

660
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,686
You're in deep shit, Connors.

661
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,691
You'd better turn yourself in and--

662
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,929
- Where are we headed?
- Back to the farm...

663
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,010
-...so you can reinject me with serum.
- Reinject you?

664
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,325
Wait, wait a minute.

665
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,851
This vehicle. Is it marked?

666
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,850
What do you mean, "Is it marked?"

667
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,930
Any distinctive characteristics
that will get us spotted?

668
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,643
Well, yeah. There's a few.

669
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,003
All right, we're gonna have to ditch
this thing. We need another ride.

670
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,722
My car's still back at the farm. Are you
gonna tell me what's going on?

671
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,922
Yeah. Brooks lied to us,
that's what's going on.

672
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,646
- He ain't the cat we thought he was.
- Well, who is he then?

673
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,729
Good fucking question.

674
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,809
See, he's an agency man.

675
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,367
He was brought in during Vietnam.

676
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,086
See, he put together this team,
this special team...

677
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,964
...that only answered
to the president.

678
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,045
Brooks was my mentor.

679
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,801
Brought us all in from nothing.
Taught us how to fight.

680
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,889
Taught us about loyalty and honour.

681
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:10,649
Made us believe we was finally doing
something right in our fucked-up lives.

682
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,764
What a joke.

683
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,681
Then there was this operation
called London Fog.

684
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,570
<i>It was a nasty little gig
during Desert storm...</i>

685
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,724
<i>...headed by our old friend,
Mr. Darryl Greene.</i>

686
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,241
That was back
when he worked for the CIA.

687
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,091
See, the agency had developed
this little nerve gas...

688
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,009
<i>...they called CMC-12.</i>

689
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,009
<i>A thousand times
more deadly than sarin.</i>

690
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,885
<i>And during the end of the war...</i>

691
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,687
<i>...the entire Iraq army--
They was hauling ass out of Kuwait.</i>

692
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,325
<i>You know what Greene wants to do?</i>

693
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,524
He decides to have
a little field test on the CMC-12.

694
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,801
- What?
- Yeah...

695
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,925
<i>...before there was any chance of talks
for a cease-fire or anything like that.</i>

696
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,965
<i>So we dropped a container.</i>

697
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,847
<i>- What?
- Took out an army platoon.</i>

698
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,487
<i>But also killed every man, woman
and child within a mile radius.</i>

699
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,681
<i>Jesus.</i>

700
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,120
And the thermos?

701
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,886
Thermos?

702
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,129
It got ten times the CMC-12
than what was dropped in Iraq.

703
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,163
Oh, my God.

704
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,408
What do you think
he's gonna do with it?

705
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,568
Who the fuck knows?

706
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,047
But I'll tell you one thing, mama.

707
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,564
If we don't find him,
we can kiss all our asses goodbye.

708
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,402
Barnes.

709
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,646
Brooks called.

710
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,411
He wants $22 million and safe
passage to a neutral country...

711
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,887
...or he'll set off CMC-12
in the middle of the city.

712
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,366
Fuck.

713
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,891
Okay, I will...

714
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,890
I will notify the president
and get him to a safe location.

715
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,606
That is exactly
what we're not going to do.

716
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,041
We keep this all in-house.
Let's not panic.

717
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,207
Okay.

718
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,846
You know Brooks better than I do,
but I don't understand.

719
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,647
Why 22 million, and why CMC-12?

720
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,524
In a warped way
it makes perfect sense.

721
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,326
This is Billy Brooks' big "fuck you"
to me and the government.

722
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,126
His annual operating
budget was 22 mil.

723
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,402
CMC-12 was my project.

724
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,807
It's a project
that's not supposed to exist.

725
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,322
What matters now is we get the
CMC-12 back and buried.

726
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,081
We'll play his game and then we'll
take down Brooks before this gets out.

727
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,328
- What's wrong?
- The door's open.

728
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,409
It's never open.

729
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,968
Know what? Go park this somewhere
where it's out of sight.

730
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,602
Oh, my God.

731
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,847
Dr. Mackenzie?

732
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,127
- He's dead.
- Bullet to the base of the skull?

733
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,849
- Bullet to the base of the skull?
- Yes!

734
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,082
- Who would do this?
- Brooks.

735
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,725
- Why?
- Look, look.

736
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,445
You have to keep it together for me.

737
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,922
You have to reinject me
so we can get out.

738
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,122
- Cleaners are on the way.
- The cleaners?

739
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,766
A team of Brooks' men.
They're gonna dispose of everything.

740
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,566
- Probably burn this to the ground.
- Okay.

741
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,648
Watch your head.

742
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,520
Now, look.

743
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,644
We've only got
one more vile left, and...

744
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,564
And you gotta remember that you've
only got about five or six hours...

745
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,001
...until the serum
starts causing headaches.

746
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,966
Yeah, and I won't see nothing in light,
I know. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

747
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,286
Oh, God.

748
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,369
- I don't know how to tell you this.
- What?

749
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,328
- We don't have any more anaesthetic.
- Of course not. Let's go.

750
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,880
- I can't do this.
- You're gonna have to.

751
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,010
- No, I can't do this.
- You have to or we dead. Just do it.

752
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,770
All right. Here.

753
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,680
Put your chin up. Yeah.

754
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,167
Okay, I think...

755
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,650
All right. I'm in.

756
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,929
I've never actually-- But okay.
Oh, my God.

757
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,571
All right.

758
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,728
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

759
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,331
On the count of three.

760
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,841
Ready?

761
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,281
One, two--

762
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,170
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Shit!

763
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,929
I'm sorry.

764
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,451
- Are you okay?
- What happened to counting to three?

765
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,450
- I didn't want you to twitch.
- The nigga twitching, ain't he?

766
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,291
- Okay.
- Goddamn it.

767
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,364
All right.

768
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,571
Something is just not
making sense to me. I mean...

769
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,171
- Here.
- No!

770
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,802
Stop. I don't need that
right now. Stop.

771
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,320
How much did it cost Brooks
to get this operation together?

772
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,010
Millions.

773
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,927
Brooks don't need to take
nothing from the government.

774
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:39,082
Over the years we took our stash,
and we ain't worrying for nothing.

775
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,964
This ain't about
no goddamn money.

776
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,571
This about getting even.

777
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:50,081
Even with Darryl, the president,
the whole fucking country.

778
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,089
What are you talking about?

779
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,211
What? What?

780
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,084
- What is it?
- The cleaners is here.

781
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,649
- Take it.
- I'm not gonna take that.

782
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,207
- Take it.
- I've never fired a gun in my life.

783
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,687
Look. This is gonna be
your initiation, then.

784
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:18,203
You gonna have to not let your
South Side girls down right now.

785
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,290
Because some gangster shit
is about to pop off in here.

786
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,731
Oh, God.

787
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,327
What do you see?

788
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,885
Three guys getting out of a van.

789
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,366
- Find somewhere to hide.
- What?

790
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,086
Anywhere. Anywhere. Go.

791
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,169
There's nothing in here.

792
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,204
- Quick, quick, quick.
- Where, though?

793
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,641
God. God.

794
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,807
Work's upstairs.

795
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,801
Hey, hey. Don't shoot. It's me.

796
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,161
It's me.

797
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:28,847
All right, Chi-town.

798
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,606
Come on.

799
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,131
- Yeah.
<i>- Mean Darryl Greene, everybody.</i>

800
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,527
Let's get on with this, okay, Brooks?
For chrissake.

801
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,563
Oh, Darryl, jeez,
you gotta lighten up.

802
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,001
You've always been
so fucking high-strung.

803
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,324
<i>Gotta take all the fun out of life...</i>

804
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,488
...walking around
with a big stick up your ass.

805
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,401
- Can we move on?
- Yes, we can.

806
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:11,206
But, Darryl,
tell Barnes to turn off the recorder.

807
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,562
<i>I know I'm getting old
but give me some credit.</i>

808
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,808
<i>There ain't no way
you can trace me.</i>

809
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,083
- You got my money?
- Yeah.

810
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,441
<i>Good.</i>

811
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,483
Okay, here's the deal.

812
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,047
I got my guys.
You got yours.

813
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,130
Now, we can make this clean
or we can make this bloody.

814
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,564
<i>Very bloody, and very fucking loud.</i>

815
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,366
- I'm listening.
- Two cars.

816
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,608
Barnes drops off the money.

817
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,247
<i>You pick up the package.</i>

818
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,490
Easy, simple, quiet.

819
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,603
- Where and when?
<i>- In one hour...</i>

820
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,565
<i>...be in your cars outside your office.</i>

821
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,524
I've got your numbers. Darryl...

822
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:54,840
<i>...any sign of backup
and the deal's off.</i>

823
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,804
There's not gonna be
any backup, Brooks.

824
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,924
You know I want this
as quiet as you do.

825
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,009
You've been very clever, I must say.

826
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,000
I'll take that as a supreme compliment
coming from you, Mr. Greene.

827
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,767
Why are we stopping?

828
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,641
- Get out.
- What do you mean, get out?

829
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,084
Get out. I'm going to D.C.

830
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,770
You're going to that gas station...

831
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,531
...and hitching a ride back
to wherever you came from.

832
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,882
No, I am not.

833
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,128
- And give me the gun.
- No.

834
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,687
- What do you mean, no?
- I mean, no.

835
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,769
I'm sticking with you.
The way I look at it...

836
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,531
...in about two hours you're gonna be
howling in pain...

837
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,131
...and you know what else?

838
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,403
You're gonna be blind as a bat.
You are gonna need me.

839
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,170
And beside that...

840
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,565
...I'm getting pretty good
with this thing.

841
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,810
You're beginning to worry me.

842
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:04,527
Just drive.

843
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,769
- Yeah?
- You both in your cars?

844
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,689
- Yes.
- Yes.

845
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,406
<i>All right, Barnes, you hold tight.
My man will come to you.</i>

846
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,284
Greenie, start up your crate.

847
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:36,562
<i>Leave your office, onto First.</i>

848
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,689
Shouldn't we warn the authorities?

849
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,120
And tell them what?

850
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:50,130
There's a weapon of mass destruction
somewhere in the D.C. area?

851
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,560
"And who are you, sir?"

852
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,240
Oh, I'm just a blind,
undercover ex-agent...

853
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,408
...rolling with a
gun-toting optometrist.

854
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:59,126
I get your point.
So how do you know where Brooks is?

855
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,721
If Brooks wanna threaten,
he'll threaten where it hurt.

856
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,809
- The president.
- He's at the White House?

857
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,126
Not exactly.

858
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,527
See, Brooks quoted <i>The Art of War,</i>
chapter two.

859
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,687
That's his bible.

860
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,930
It's an ancient Chinese book
on battle tactics.

861
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:15,408
It's kind of just stating that the first
defeat could be the final victory.

862
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,840
You know, symmetry.

863
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:20,761
Okay, so where is this symmetry
gonna take us?

864
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,563
I'm just crossing onto
Maryland Avenue now.

865
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,683
<i>Now keep going, you're almost there.</i>

866
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:32,209
Turn that corner
and what do you see?

867
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,490
I see the White House.

868
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,728
<i>Yeah. Now look across the street.</i>

869
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:39,002
<i>What do you see?</i>

870
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,685
<i>Fun idea, huh?</i>

871
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,362
<i>The first defeat
can be the final victory.</i>

872
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,883
- Barnes, you still with me?
- Yeah.

873
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:02,001
<i>He's here.
Let him in, bring him to me.</i>

874
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,491
Darryl, that you?
What are you drinking?

875
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:15,886
Cut the shit. Let's do this.

876
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,363
You've never had any style,
Greenie.

877
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,328
That's always been
your big problem.

878
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,885
Relax.

879
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,686
You're the guest of honour.
Have a seat.

880
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,683
Darryl...

881
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,644
...have a seat.

882
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,485
Your boys need more training.

883
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,725
Will you please stop showing off
and sit down?

884
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,729
Please?

885
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,367
- Barnes, you there?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

886
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,164
<i>Where's Greene?</i>

887
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,124
He's right here with me.

888
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,570
Don't worry.

889
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,489
We're gonna start
our little transaction.

890
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,081
<i>See my man walking towards you?</i>

891
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,371
- Yeah.
<i>- That's the drop. Give it to him.</i>

892
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,443
Barnes?

893
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,130
Barnes, give it to him.

894
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,201
It's okay, Barnes.

895
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,851
I'm sorry about this, Darryl.
I really am.

896
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:59,690
You weren't on the ground in '91
to see what your little concoction does.

897
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,803
Sure wasn't pretty.

898
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,368
Now let me see.
How does this thing work again?

899
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,091
Let me see.

900
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:15,161
Now, I believe all I have to do
is push this button...

901
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,761
...the protective seal cracks...

902
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:22,648
...causing the cooling
liquid nitrogen inside to escape...

903
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,286
...and then, my friend,
there's no going back.

904
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:26,925
You can't disarm it.

905
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,368
In about five minutes...

906
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:33,042
...it becomes unstable, explodes...

907
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:37,484
...and a totally invisible toxic cloud...

908
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,885
...could engulf you...

909
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,928
...and waft through every
nook and cranny of this hotel...

910
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:48,250
...cross Pennsylvania Avenue
into the White House...

911
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:52,411
...and two of my favourite people
will be in heaven.

912
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,921
And along with them...

913
01:09:55,120 --> 01:10:01,366
...their little, secret executive order
to eliminate one Billy Brooks.

914
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:15,482
Excuse me. Do you have
a William Brooks here?

915
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:18,160
Brooks. B-R-O-O-K-S.

916
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:22,160
Brooks, William.

917
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,442
- No, sorry.
- Greene?

918
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,120
- Darryl Greene.
- Yeah, Darryl Greene. G-R-E-E-N--

919
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,766
- ls there an E on the end of that?
- Yeah.

920
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,289
You mean the Darryl Greene
retirement party?

921
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,561
- Yes, that's it.
- Yeah.

922
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,569
- It's private.
- Well, where--?

923
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,000
- Where is it at?
- Where is it?

924
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,680
I can't tell you that.
That's against hotel policy.

925
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,086
Just give it to him.

926
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,204
I wouldn't mess with her, homey.

927
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,243
It's the executive dining room.

928
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,162
That's what's up. Bonnie...

929
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:51,964
...come to Clyde.

930
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,845
- Sorry.
- That's as far as you go, okay?

931
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,008
- What?
- I need you here, right here.

932
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,645
No, but I--

933
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,530
Him?

934
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,524
You gotta be out of your mind.

935
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,848
There's nowhere on earth
you'll be able to hide.

936
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,286
You see, that's the thing.
See, I won't have to.

937
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:16,723
Because thanks to you,
nobody knows about this.

938
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,684
So later on, when they investigate...

939
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,531
...and find that you shot yourself
with your own gun...

940
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:25,850
...they'll find this...suicide note--

941
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:30,525
Very adroitly forged.
--explaining everything.

942
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:34,202
How you were
so terribly distraught...

943
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,084
...and guilty about your misdeeds.

944
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,805
How you blamed the government...

945
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,767
...and how this was your own
personal deranged plan...

946
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,965
...to set the whole thing straight.

947
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,042
You're the deranged one, Brooks.

948
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,924
And the rest of you...

949
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,327
...you gonna go along
with this sick fuck?

950
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,164
I taught my men you gotta be
a little nuts in this business to survive.

951
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,044
You won't just kill me
and the president.

952
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,890
You'll kill everyone within five miles.

953
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,289
Collateral damage.

954
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,767
You didn't seem to mind in Iraq.

955
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,770
This is America, damn it,
the people you're paid to protect.

956
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,851
You fired me, you fuck!

957
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,244
I'm off the payroll, Darryl. For good.

958
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,681
So fuck you.

959
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,605
Do it.

960
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,361
Connors.

961
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,730
Connors?

962
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,371
That you, partner?

963
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,801
Put down the canister
and drop your guns.

964
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,968
What did you do?

965
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:57,527
Put some more
of that crap in your eyes?

966
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:01,683
I told you about trying to be a hero.

967
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:05,521
That is not the way
the game is played, my brother.

968
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,851
You know you played me out, right?

969
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,724
Hell, I had to. I needed you.

970
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:18,284
I could tell that the layoff
had affected you, and...

971
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,088
...well, it-- Oh, fuck.

972
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,484
I'm gonna tell you the truth. I knew
damn well you wouldn't do the gig.

973
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:29,086
That's the first thing that came out
your mouth that wasn't a fucking lie.

974
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,205
What the hell? That's him!

975
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,284
- Get him, he's unarmed.
- Careful, behind there.

976
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,721
- Behind there, go.
- There he is, there he is!

977
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,370
He's got my gun.

978
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:48,803
- There, in the corner!
- Not me, damn it.

979
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,485
You son of a bitch!

980
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,610
Brooks!

981
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,165
He's out the door.

982
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,886
Connors, get him! Kill the bastard.

983
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,208
Shut your ass up.

984
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,291
Brooks.

985
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,246
Brooks!

986
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,442
Drop the gun. Drop it!

987
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,089
Drop it, drop it.

988
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,324
And the bomb.

989
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,885
Step away.

990
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,165
Can't we talk this out, partner?

991
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,049
I mean, you're forgetting I let you go.

992
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:04,804
Even left you
that pretty bitch to help you out.

993
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,927
Now, if I wanted to kill you...

994
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,805
...I would have done it
right then and there.

995
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,163
That's the only reason you ain't got
a bullet in your ass right now.

996
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,283
See, you ain't nothing
but a common murderer.

997
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,250
Stone-cold killer, huh?

998
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:22,369
You killed Dr. Mackenzie
and his assistant...

999
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,050
...for what?

1000
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,804
It had to be done.

1001
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,287
You know how it works,
you gotta tie up the loose ends.

1002
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:38,165
Look, this government
was gonna kill me.

1003
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,523
I don't give a fuck if it's
the president or the pope...

1004
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,165
...or who the fuck else.

1005
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:47,441
I ain't hardly sitting around
waiting for somebody to off me.

1006
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:50,883
Mama Brooks didn't raise
no stupid-ass children.

1007
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,040
Oh, there's my ride.

1008
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:06,520
All I gotta do is signal for pickup...

1009
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,961
...break the seal on the CMC...

1010
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,401
...and in five minutes, I'm free.

1011
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,602
Well, look, you could come with me.

1012
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,610
We could head for
the Grand Cayman islands.

1013
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,529
Break open my piggy bank.

1014
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:23,283
Start spending
that 100 mil I been stacking.

1015
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,801
No! No more of your fucking lies!

1016
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,527
We could get your eyes right.
That's the first thing we'll do, dog.

1017
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,404
Permanent.

1018
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,409
You gotta make
a decision here, partner.

1019
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,928
You wanna be a blind old man...

1020
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,885
...sitting out the rest of your days
on your back porch...

1021
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,606
...in the fog, getting sauced?

1022
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,689
Or you wanna be somebody again?

1023
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,770
No! It's over, shut up!

1024
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,364
Marco.

1025
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,242
You're supposed to say Polo.

1026
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,965
Don't play fucking games, right?

1027
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,922
Brooks, do not fucking move.

1028
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,364
Billy!

1029
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,004
Brooks!

1030
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,010
Brooks!

1031
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,604
Polo.

1032
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:02,928
<i>It's in locker number 605,
it's kept on ice.</i>

1033
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,088
Howard, what?

1034
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:42,285
That's impossible. I had my hand
over my mouth the entire time.

1035
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,323
- What's the trick?
- Ain't no trick.

1036
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,761
Of course there's a trick.

1037
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,042
- There's gotta be.
- Okay.

1038
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:51,481
- You got me, there is a trick.
- What?

1039
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,047
You're the only pain in the ass
that comes and visit me.

1040
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,924
- That's it?
- That's it.

1041
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,531
Now, what do you want?

1042
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:02,642
My transmission is fucked.
My clutch is mush.

1043
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,241
- So?
- So before you took my classic...

1044
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,444
...on your little joy ride,
she was virgin tight.

1045
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,007
- It's gonna cost me money.
- I knew it was coming.

1046
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,282
- How much?
- About a grand.

1047
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,687
Bullshit. That whole truck
ain't worth a grand.

1048
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,929
All right, 250,
if I get Debbie to do the work.

1049
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,805
And you're never, never gonna
borrow my ride again.

1050
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,684
Whatever, I'll give you
a check tomorrow.

1051
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,530
You better.

1052
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,802
- Hey, Howard?
- Yeah?

1053
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,161
What are you doing later?

1054
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,762
You and Debbie wanna come over,
have some grub?

1055
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,531
With you?

1056
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,804
Hey, this is a first.
What's the occasion?

1057
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,570
It's no occasion, it's just dinner.

1058
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:45,730
- Sounds great. What are we having?
- We having steak.

1059
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:49,888
Oh, no, no. Absolutely not.

1060
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:54,444
Red meat? Now I know
where you get all this aggression.

1061
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,210
Red meat.

1062
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,165
Fuck, no wonder you got
the Man shooting at you.

1063
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,362
You're bringing trouble
into your neighbourhood.

1064
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:06,771
It's the whole bad karma, red meat,
military-industrial complex...

1065
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,042
-...macho-fantasy bullshit.
- Okay.

1066
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,204
More for us.

1067
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:20,409
Shit.

1068
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,769
What you doing,
lighting up the barbecue...

1069
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,291
...or burning down my yacht?

1070
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,802
I'm not burning anything,
I can't get the charcoals lit.

1071
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,083
You know, might
have to go inside.

1072
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,203
You know, with that
cooking skills of yours...

1073
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,164
...you gonna make
a lucky man real happy.

1074
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,885
All right, shut up.

1075
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,491
Thank you.

1076
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,205
Look, I'm only kidding.

1077
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,483
Why don't you come over here
and sit down. Take a load off, mama.

1078
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,409
I'm all over that.

1079
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,282
- Here, baby, take that.
- Thank you.

1080
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,769
How's about a little toast?

1081
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:56,361
You know, actually we have
nothing to toast about.

1082
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,927
- I mean, neither one of us has a job.
- True.

1083
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,929
- Both of our bosses are dead.
- As doorknobs.

1084
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,088
- You killed yours.
- Hey, it was self-defence.

1085
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,726
Greene is back at his cushy job.

1086
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,242
Swept everything under the carpet like
the last two days never even existed.

1087
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,649
- That's the way the government do.
- There's no funds for the research.

1088
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,729
No serum.

1089
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,122
- And you're still blind.
- As a bat.

1090
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,971
- So see, there's nothing to toast to.
- I disagree.

1091
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,844
All right, so,
what is there to toast to?

1092
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,169
Well, I think...

1093
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,567
...that we need to toast...

1094
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,121
...to our friendship.

1095
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,365
To our friendship.

1096
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,004
Connors, if you go
Mr. Rogers on me...

1097
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:40,522
-...I'm gonna throw myself off this boat.
- Don't do that, I need you.

1098
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:45,925
All right, so, what, you've got
some kind of a friendship toast?

1099
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,646
- Matter of fact, I do.
- Of course.

1100
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:51,730
One of my O.G. killer soldiers
taught it to me...

1101
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,490
...while we was together on the brig.

1102
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:56,202
While you was on the brig?

1103
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,402
- All right, let's hear it.
- All right.

1104
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,730
Here's to you...

1105
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,160
...and here's to me.

1106
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,610
And friends we shall be...

1107
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:06,880
...till eternity.

1108
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:10,008
And if we ever disagree...

1109
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,009
...fuck you, and here's to me.

1110
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,004
That is retarded.

1111
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,965
I know, but you laughed
and you toasted.

1112
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,321
You're right about that.

1113
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,048
God, it's freezing out here.

1114
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,810
Nice day for a barbeque.

1115
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,282
Know what, I know someplace
that's not cold.

1116
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:31,891
Yeah, me too. Hawaii.

1117
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:35,404
I was thinking more of the lines
of the Cayman islands.

1118
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,728
Cayman islands.
Name me one good reason...

1119
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,890
...to go to the Caymans
instead of Hawaii.

1120
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,367
I got a hundred million
good reasons to go.

1121
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,846
A hundred million reasons?

1122
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,280
All right, name me one.

1123
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:50,128
Two first-class tickets
with our names on them.

1124
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:53,803
- You're full of shit.
- I ain't lying.
