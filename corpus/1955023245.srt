[Bells Jingling]

2
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:22,390
[Man] Good morning,
Southern California.

3
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:24,792
7:51 on the
Pepper and Spice Show.

4
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:27,328
Fifteen days till Christmas,

5
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,598
And we're talkin' about
who you want to see on
Santa's naughty list.

6
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:33,667
[Woman]
Let's see. We've got a tweet
here from Jamarco.

7
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:37,338
"How about those
Salvation Army bell ringers?"

8
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,574
[Man]
Oh, constant clanging
in the month of December.

9
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:42,376
[Woman]
Shame on you, Jamarco.

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,778
I think what you need
is a good spanking.

11
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:47,181
[Man]
I was just going to
send him a T-shirt.

12
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:51,252
Gloria from Pasadena
wants to see her husband Alex
on the naughty list.

13
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:54,322
Well, tell me, Gloria,
what has Alex done...

14
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:56,657
To get himself in hot water
with you and Santa?

15
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,726
-[Gloria On Phone]
He cheated on me.
-[Alarm Wailing]

16
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,862
Uh-oh. Sounds like Alex
has been a very naughty boy.

17
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,233
Now, listen, the naughty list
is a pretty serious thing.

18
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,601
I mean, you can't just say
your husband's cheating on you.

19
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,570
We're gonna need
to see some proof.

20
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,505
Okay, people.
On your toes.

21
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:15,376
I don't want this
getting away from us.
I want a tight leash on him.

22
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,379
[Gloria] For starters,
how 'bout a million text
messages on his work phone...

23
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,481
From some skank named Wanda?

24
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:23,117
And last night,
he comes in at 4:00
in the morning,

25
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:24,852
And says he was out
Christmas shopping.

26
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,687
In all fairness, I mean,

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,290
Most stores do have
holiday extended hours.

28
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,259
Ah, come on.
Until 4:00 in the morning?

29
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,394
What about all
those text messages?

30
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,664
I mean, what can you
really tell about someone
from a text message?

31
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:39,767
What's this?
What are they doing?
What's going on?

32
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,437
Hello, Wanda.
I wonder if you might
do us a small favor.

33
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:46,607
For all we know,
Wanda could be, like,
some shut-in, you know,

34
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,309
That needs someone
to talk to.

35
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,411
And Alex, well, Alex,
maybe he's a secret Santa...

36
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,580
Out at all hours
of the night,

37
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:56,617
Going to orphanages
and shelters.

38
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,752
Or maybe he's
a complete schmuck.

39
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,754
Let's get him on the line
and find out.

40
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,557
No, no, no, no.
We don't have clearance
for that. No, no. Hang up.

41
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,194
[Alex On Phone]
Yeah, hello?

42
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,229
[High-pitched Voice]
Hi, Alex.

43
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,364
Yeah, speaking.
Who's this?

44
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:13,934
Alex, this is Murray,
the elf from the North Pole,
calling.

45
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,870
Okay. Why not?
I got nothing better to do
than sit in traffic.

46
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,872
What can I do for you,
Murray?

47
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:22,376
As you know,
this is the time of the year
when we're going over our list,

48
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,280
And we're checkin' it twice,
and it appears you're
on the naughty list.

49
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:30,218
Oh, that's too bad.
What did I do, leave
the toilet seat up again?

50
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,686
Well, I think it's a little
more serious than that.

51
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,756
You see, when Santa comes
down your chimney in the wee
hours of the morning,

52
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,425
He's bringing
divorce papers!

53
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,560
Wait a minute.
Who is this?

54
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:42,530
You happen to know
anyone named Wanda?

55
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:45,499
Did my nut-job wife
put you up to this?

56
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,635
[Gloria]
I'm here,
you bimbo-chasing lowlife.

57
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,603
What's her I.Q., like 60?

58
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:52,340
[Alex]
I think you're getting mixed up
with your dress size, honey.

59
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:55,776
Now, now. Let's be good,
for goodness' sake.

60
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,379
[Gloria]
Hey, you better lawyer up, pal,

61
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,614
Because I'm coming after
your skinny little lying...

62
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:02,916
Unfortunately, that's all
the time we have today.

63
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,553
You've been listening
to Pepper and Spice
in the Morning.

64
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:08,922
And I'd like to give
a big shout-out to all
those overpaid folks...

65
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:10,891
Who make this show go.

66
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:14,462
And remember, ladies,
no matter how hot
you might be,

67
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,897
You can always use
a little Pepper in your life.

68
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,367
And I'm gone.

69
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,868
[Man]
And we're out.

70
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,603
- Killed it.
- Yes.

71
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:44,325
[Man]
My friends invite me over, but
I just can't seem to get there.

72
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:48,296
Not yet anyway.
Not since Lucille died.

73
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,598
It's been 19 months.

74
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,700
I just don't know
what to do?

75
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,304
You know, Ross, it is
perfectly normal to feel...

76
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:59,307
Intense feelings of loss
at Christmas.

77
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,643
You know, there's this
expectation of loved ones
getting together,

78
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:05,979
And, sadly,
your loved one is gone.

79
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:09,517
Do you mind if I ask
how long you and Lucille
were together?

80
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,021
Let's see.
Got her used in '98.

81
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,757
But I swapped engines
four or five years ago.

82
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,760
Wait. I'm sorry.
Was, uh, Lucille a car?

83
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,563
You kidding?
Try a two-ton truck.

84
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,065
Why? What'd you think she was?

85
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,034
You know,
on second thought,

86
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:30,704
I think 18 months
is probably plenty of time
to grieve.

87
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:33,341
And if you have friends
still willing
to invite you over,

88
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:37,511
I would walk...
no, I would probably run there
as fast as I could.

89
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,547
You're listening to
Dr. Love in the Morning.

90
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,049
And we'll be back
with more of your calls
right after this.

91
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:46,487
- I mean...
- [Phone Rings]

92
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,356
Dr. Love.
What's your problem?

93
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,058
Hey. Guy grieving
a pickup truck?

94
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,060
Is that
the best we got?

95
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,563
[Laughing]
Seriously?

96
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,898
You expect me
to put that on the air?

97
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:01,435
No. No. No, sir.
A crisis is bad radio,

98
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:03,337
Which is what you're
describing right now.

99
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:04,805
Call back
when you got real problems.

100
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,607
Geez.

101
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,976
- Would it kill you
to be nicer to callers?
- What?

102
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,978
I'm saving them
from you.

103
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,981
- Me? What did I do?
- You baby them.

104
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:17,585
Oh, it's natural
to have feelings of loss.

105
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:20,588
Seriously.
Give me an hour on the mike,
I'll show you how it's done.

106
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:24,425
Welcome to the octagon.
This is Dr. Tough Love.
Get over it! Aah!

107
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,894
Okay. Okay.
So, how 'bout,
hands down,

108
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:30,097
You are the worst
call screener
in all of radio.

109
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,600
Better. Yeah.
That had some real bite.

110
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,735
- Did it? Did it hurt?
- Felt it right here.

111
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,770
- You're back on in 10.
- Okay.

112
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:39,507
- And, uh, Cole wants
to see you after the show.
- Wait, what? Why?

113
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,008
Is it about ratings?

114
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,977
No, it's our improper
workplace romance.

115
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,380
How the heck do I know?

116
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:49,450
In three, two...

117
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:53,521
Greetings. And welcome back
to Dr. Love in the Morning.

118
00:05:56,957 --> 00:06:00,394
I'm doing what I can.
Yes, I will talk to them again,
for the hundredth time.

119
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:02,095
Yeah, sure.

120
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,865
So I have courtside seats
to the Lakers...

121
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,034
Right next to Nicholson.

122
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,002
Thanks, but I'll pass.

123
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,971
Come on.
You love basketball.

124
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,507
No, actually, I hated it.

125
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,876
I only went along
to be with you.

126
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,011
Oh, well, that's perfect.
Just come along with me then.

127
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,514
It was a college thing,
sweetie.

128
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:21,649
A long time ago.

129
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:22,916
Ouch.

130
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,187
Pepper.
In my office, now.

131
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,157
Do me a favor,
and hold him off for me?

132
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,826
For old times' sake.
Thank you.

133
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,573
Pepper had to scoot.
Anything I can help you
with, Mr. Harper?

134
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:49,042
Okay. That show-off thinks
he can get away with
whatever he wants.

135
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,045
Well, this time,
not gonna happen.

136
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,454
Ah, Morris, my man.

137
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,190
Courtside seats
for you and the kid.

138
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,058
Here you go.
Just make sure and use 'em.

139
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,594
Spent a lot of money
on those.

140
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:07,695
Seriously?

141
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:10,097
Yeah, it's the least
I can do for my agent, right?

142
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,834
Pepper, I gave these to you
for your last birthday.

143
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,805
And my birthday wish
is to bring a little joy
to you and your son.

144
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,907
- Daughter.
- That's what I meant.

145
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,710
Look, where have you been
hiding? I've been looking
for you all afternoon.

146
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,945
I've just been laying low, man,
till Harper calms down.

147
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:28,081
Well, he hasn't,
and you've been suspended.

148
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,551
What? What are you
talking about?

149
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:34,087
Corporate called an hour ago.
They are taking you off the air
until further notice.

150
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:38,025
Uh, off the air? No.
They... Why?

151
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,893
The little stunt you pulled
this morning.

152
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:42,195
You know, the naughty list.
Murray the elf.

153
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,664
Yeah. Dude, that was funny.

154
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,666
Yeah, well, not
to Alex King.

155
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,935
That's the guy you threw
under the bus.

156
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,871
The TV guy.
Oh! That was him?

157
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:53,607
Alex King,
the Kong of Big Screens.

158
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:55,876
The station's
biggest advertiser.

159
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,512
Okay, okay.
So, I'll apologize.

160
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:01,849
I'll buy one of those
planet-sized TVs of his
for the staff. We'll be good.

161
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:06,153
Alex King
can buy and sell you.

162
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:09,022
He does not want your money.
He wants your head
on a stick, man.

163
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:11,692
[Stammers]

164
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:14,294
Okay. All right.
Maybe we can
make this work.

165
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,864
Let me try to milk
the controversy.

166
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,699
I'll stir up some press.

167
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,934
You go away for a couple
of weeks, come back
to even bigger numbers.

168
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:24,137
Couple of weeks? What?
Man, are you crazy?

169
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:27,040
That's like a million years
in radio time. Everyone's
gonna think I'm dead.

170
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:30,110
Well, that is better
than actually being dead,
which is what Alex King wants.

171
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,746
Okay. What about remotes?

172
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,717
I'll just keep my name
out there by calling in
from some exotic place...

173
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,719
Like, uh, Tahiti?

174
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:41,722
[Laughing]

175
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,658
Pepper, I'm sure management
wants to send you
quite a few places,

176
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,193
But Tahiti
is not one of them.

177
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,161
Here.
What's this?

178
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,731
Airline ticket.
Corporate took the liberty
of reassigning you...

179
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,332
To a sister station
until further notice.

180
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,567
They can do that?

181
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:56,069
Read your contract, Pepper.

182
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,171
They own you.

183
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,841
You leave
on a red-eye tonight.

184
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,577
Where the heck
is Idyllwild, Colorado?

185
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:06,814
Beats me, but, uh,
you might want to
pack your Snuggies.

186
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,856
- [Knocks]
- Hey.

187
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,191
Sandy, come in.
Have a seat.

188
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,929
Uh, do you want water
or something?

189
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:25,065
Um, no. No, I'm okay.
Thank you.

190
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,835
Well, let's talk
about your show.

191
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:30,303
Okay. Cool.
Look, I know what
you're gonna say.

192
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:33,306
The ratings... they haven't
been what they should be,
and I agree with you,

193
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,743
But I feel like
if you just give us
a little time...

194
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:38,779
- Sandy...
- No one knew who Dr. Laura was
for, like 15 years.

195
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,615
- Now she has a huge career.
- I'm not canceling your show.

196
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:42,883
You're not?

197
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,584
No.

198
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:48,088
You're the best show we have,
and you're right... it takes time
to build an audience.

199
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,090
But I think I have
a way to help.

200
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,363
Pepper Sterling,
one of the hottest
radio jocks in L.A.

201
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,299
This could be big for you.
The network that owns us
thinks he's gonna be huge.

202
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,270
That's great for him,

203
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,639
But unless he's
moving here to Whoville,
how does this help us?

204
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:09,309
That's exactly what he's doing.
And not voluntarily.

205
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,845
Apparently, he ticked off
some big-shot advertiser,

206
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:14,648
So they need to put him on ice
till things blow over.

207
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:16,817
Mmm. So we get
to babysit him.

208
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,652
Not "we." You.

209
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,856
Say hello
to your new cohost.

210
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,761
What? No. No.
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't want a cohost.

211
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:30,964
I mean, what does this guy
even know about psychotherapy?

212
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:33,233
- Anything?
- It doesn't matter.
That's your job.

213
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,368
If he gives us
a bump in the ratings,
that's what you need.

214
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,638
Do I have any say
in this?

215
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,009
[Sighs]
Corporate wants to
park him here,

216
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:45,245
So we're gonna be good soldiers
and make the best of it.

217
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,380
If he brings
a little attention
to the best thing on radio,

218
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:49,817
Not to mention
the most beautiful,

219
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,218
Even better.

220
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,756
Okay. So, when does
this Pepper Sterling guy
get here?

221
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:56,890
Tomorrow morning.

222
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:57,958
Tomorrow?

223
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,761
And I want you to pick him up
from the airport.

224
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,697
It'll give you guys a chance
to hang out before the show.

225
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:05,298
You owe me so big.

226
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,868
Fine. What about dinner
at my place?

227
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,037
Tomorrow night
after the show?

228
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,973
How 'bout dinner,
no your place?

229
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,108
You're drivin' me crazy.
You know that.

230
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,344
Well, maybe you should call
that radio shrink.

231
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,780
I heard
she's really good.

232
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:29,456
Final boarding call for
flight 371 service to Boulder,
gate two.

233
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,894
Mr. Sterling. Hi.

234
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,963
Sandra Love.
Welcome to Idyllwild.

235
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:40,000
Thanks.
It's just one bag.

236
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:44,271
[Chuckles]
I... I think there's been
a little misunderstanding.

237
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,874
You're the car service, right,
from the radio station?

238
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:52,212
No. Um, I'm your new cohost.
Actually, technically, you're
my new cohost, but...

239
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,848
You know, you're here
helping with my show.

240
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:58,085
- Oh, your show?
- That's right.

241
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:02,222
Okay, look, I...
[Sighs]

242
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,758
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

243
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:07,394
Sandy Love.
Welcome to Idyllwild.

244
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:10,263
I'm guessing it's not
a heavy metal show.

245
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:13,333
[Sandy]
No, no. It's more
like a help line.

246
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,302
You know, people call in
with problems,

247
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,971
Usually relationship issues,
things like that.

248
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:21,008
Sounds like
a barrel of fun.

249
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,516
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

250
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,418
What?

251
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:34,221
Look, I'll slum it
on your touchy-feely
radio show if I have to,

252
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,056
But shopping...
No fricking way.

253
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,891
There's only so much torture
I can take.

254
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,861
Will you relax?
I promise it won't
be painful.

255
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,464
[Door Hinges Squeaking]

256
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,166
Come on.

257
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,270
[Sighs]

258
00:12:58,245 --> 00:12:59,813
Oh, hey.

259
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:03,050
What do you think?

260
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,085
I think you look
just like one of us.

261
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,154
Yeah, that's what
I'm afraid of.

262
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:09,356
Come on. We got
a lot of work to do.

263
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,259
Welcome to your
new place of employment.

264
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,227
You gotta be kidding me.

265
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,175
Here we are.

266
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,078
KZJJ, 99.6.

267
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,213
Home of Dr. Love
in the Morning.

268
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,714
Geez.
For a minute there,

269
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:38,351
I thought you were leading me
into a top-secret division
of the C.I.A.

270
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:40,988
Hey. Pepper, I'm Cole,
station manager.

271
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,055
And prison warden.

272
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:43,156
Oh, come on.

273
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,093
Cheer up. It's not that bad,
once you get used to it.

274
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,195
You want to give him
the 25-cent tour?

275
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:53,266
Sure. Which won't take long
because we only have
one studio.

276
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,168
This is true.

277
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:56,937
- Okay.
- So...

278
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,539
Most of our content comes
from the network feed.

279
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,442
And any live programming we do
happens right here.

280
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,178
It's probably not exactly
what you're used to.

281
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:08,448
That's okay.
You can't have caviar
all the time, right?

282
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:11,218
Sometimes you gotta
take a step back.

283
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,987
Way back.
Is that a sundial?

284
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:17,324
Uh, no, no, no.
That's actually my seat.
We have you set up right here.

285
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,458
[Pepper] Okay.

286
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,060
[Whimpering]

287
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:23,096
[Whimpering Continues]

288
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,465
Pepper Sterling.

289
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,434
Pepper Sterling.
[Laughs]

290
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,103
This is Jonah.
He's our engineer.
He's like a puppy.

291
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:31,638
Once he smells you,
he'll settle down.

292
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:34,407
You, sir, are a god.

293
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:37,177
I am such a huge fan.

294
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,279
You know, I stream
every single one
of your shows,

295
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:43,183
And I just want to say
that if it wasn't for
my crappy salary,

296
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,018
I would totally build
a shrine to you.

297
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,020
Thanks.

298
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:50,223
Okay. Well, um,
it's about show time.

299
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:53,260
So, leave you to it.
Welcome aboard.

300
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,495
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Okay. Um...

301
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:59,432
Hey, if you need anything
at all while you're here,
you just come to me, okay?

302
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:02,169
And I mean
anything at all.

303
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,171
Okay. Great.
Have a good show.

304
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,705
You're awesome, dude.

305
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,541
Okay. So I know it's hard
coming in cold.

306
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,211
I took the liberty
of putting together some
production notes for you.

307
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,314
Look at that.
Proper online form
and everything.

308
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:17,517
Even a little staple
in the corner. Cute.

309
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,953
Well, a disciplined show
is a good show.

310
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:21,388
And a motto too.

311
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,959
Okay, look,

312
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,061
I know that you
don't wanna be here.

313
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,464
Okay? And I'm not really
that thrilled to share
my show with you either.

314
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:34,267
But I feel like
if we just show each other
a little respect...

315
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:37,437
And show my show
some respect,

316
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,239
That we'll be just fine.

317
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,640
Respect. Your show.

318
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,209
Yeah.

319
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:43,610
Got it.

320
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,412
Thank you.

321
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,281
- [Jonah] Live in 10.
- Ha! Hoo! Hah!

322
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,416
What are you doing?

323
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,750
Vocal exercises.

324
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,220
You know, just
limbering up the cords.

325
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,991
Uh, live in three.

326
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:02,062
[Loud Laughing]

327
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:05,165
- What are you doing?
- Old deejay trick. Happy face,
happy voice, right?

328
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,669
No, not happy face.
Scary face. You look
like the Joker.

329
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:17,444
Hi. Uh, greetings.
And welcome to Dr. Love
in the Morning.

330
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,613
Today we have
a very special guest.

331
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,616
In from our sister station
in Los Angeles, please welcome
Pepper Sterling.

332
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,220
Hey there, Idyllwild.
You guys ready to get wild
and crazy?

333
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:30,123
Actually, Pepper,
our long-time listeners
will tell you...

334
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,092
We don't use
the word "crazy"
around here...

335
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,761
Because we feel like
it stereotypes people
with real issues.

336
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,730
Okay. Well, how about
uptight and controlling?

337
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:40,567
Good? No good?

338
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:45,072
With that, let's take
our first caller.

339
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:48,175
Kenny, hi.
Where are you calling from?

340
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,044
[Kenny]
Uh, a telephone.

341
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:54,181
Good answer.
What can I help you
with today?

342
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:57,284
Uh, this girl
in my high school class.

343
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,586
I kind of want to ask her
to the Christmas formal,

344
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,721
But she's sort of
out of my league.

345
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:05,558
Oh, Kenny, look, it's dating,
it's not football.

346
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:08,695
There's no leagues.
Women don't think like that.

347
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,131
- Okay.
- That's right, Kenny.

348
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,433
And I flew all the way here
on a magic unicorn.

349
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,135
[Kenny Chuckles]

350
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,537
Women value
thoughtfulness...

351
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,806
Even more than they do
physical attraction.

352
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,275
If you want her
to go out with you,

353
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,644
Don't just go up to her locker
and ask her out.

354
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,147
Be brave, you know?
Be bold.

355
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,149
Really sweep her
off her feet.

356
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:30,217
All right then.

357
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,585
Kenny, if I may
offer my opinion...

358
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:36,523
No, you may not.
Jonah, who's our next caller?

359
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,126
Uh, that would be no one.

360
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:43,230
Kenny, I don't know you,
but the fact that you're
calling in on this show...

361
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,665
Pretty much tells me
that you are no George Clooney.

362
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:48,868
So I'd say the chances
of you getting rejected...

363
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:53,140
Fall somewhere between
sure thing and stone-cold lock.

364
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:57,377
My advice: Take the money
you'd blow on a tux
and buy yourself an Xbox.

365
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,647
It'll never leave you
nor will it ever tell you
to share your feelings.

366
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,517
Unless, of course,
your feelings are,
"Take that, sucker!"

367
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:08,555
With that brilliant
piece of advice,
we'll be right back.

368
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,823
Listen here,
you overpaid twit.

369
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:13,460
I googled you last night,

370
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,662
And despite thousands
of tedious pages
I had to read through,

371
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,764
I didn't find
one redeeming quality.

372
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,800
You're smug and crude,

373
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,803
And you use people's lives
to get a cheap laugh.

374
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:27,240
We don't do that here
on my show, okay?

375
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:28,641
And that's right.
I said it.

376
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,777
My show. Mine, okay?

377
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,380
Mine, mine, mine.
You got it?

378
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:37,750
Or do I need to put
a Sticky Note on that
Cro-Magnon forehead of yours?

379
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,821
What are you
laughing about?

380
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,759
[Gasps]
Are we on the air?

381
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,429
And we'll be
right back, folks.

382
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,834
I think that went well.

383
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,912
I promise you
that will never, ever
happen again.

384
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:08,815
- That's too bad.
- And you have every right
to feel like that. I just...

385
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:11,551
I'm sorry.
What did you say?

386
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:14,321
We don't get hard numbers
till the end of the week,
but based on these,

387
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,656
You two are a hit.

388
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,291
We haven't got calls like this
in a long time.

389
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:21,794
- The phones lit up right
after your little episode.
- That was more of a conniption.

390
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:25,332
- Shut up.
- Whatever it was,
keep doing it.

391
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:26,966
People seem to eat it up.

392
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,536
Yeah, but, Cole,
these are all complaints.

393
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,871
Honestly, love you
or loathe you,

394
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,773
Just as long
as they keep listening.

395
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,343
You know what?
Maybe she's right.

396
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,811
Maybe this was just
a bad idea.

397
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,214
If I were you,
I'd call the network,

398
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:43,450
I'd tell them this
is all a disaster,

399
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,552
Send my sorry butt
on the next plane
out of here.

400
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,321
- That's what I would do.
Let me call 'em for you.
- Nice try.

401
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,657
You're both adults.
Figure it out.

402
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,694
Now if you'll excuse us,
Pepper. Sandy and I have
a dinner engagement.

403
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,763
Jonah will take you
to your motel.

404
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,232
I'll pick you up out front.
Meet you there.

405
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,968
- [Snorts]
- What?

406
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,936
[Kissing]

407
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,773
[Scoffs]
Grow up.

408
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:19,486
[Laughing]

409
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:25,024
Can you believe it?
The village idiot in there
has you down for next Christmas.

410
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:29,262
I mean, what kind of moron
books a place a year in advance?

411
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:30,963
That's all right.
Maybe it's here
on the reservation.

412
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:33,300
Look, no, no, no.

413
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,635
Okay. Look, man.
It's no big deal.

414
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:36,803
We'll just go
to another place.

415
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,971
Dude, this is
the only game in town,

416
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:42,842
So unless you have
some long-lost cousin
here in Hicksville,

417
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,278
- you're hosed.
- You're kidding.

418
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:48,515
I mean, this is Colorado.
There's gotta be, like,
some ski chalet or something.

419
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:52,419
Absolutely, yeah.
Tons of 'em right up
the road in Aspen.

420
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,987
- Perfect.
- Which is about
six hours from here.

421
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:58,391
Great.
That's just great.

422
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,860
Despair not, my friend.
I got a solution. Come on.

423
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,345
Uh... Oh, man.

424
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,415
You're gonna love
this place.

425
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:25,552
Uh, there's only one place
good enough for my boy,
Pepper Sterling.

426
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:26,919
Here we go.

427
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,756
[Laughing]

428
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,660
Welcome to the broadcasters'
bachelor pad!

429
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,397
- Your garage apartment.
- No, no, no.

430
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,468
Combination boudoir
and radio museum.

431
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,603
See, uh...

432
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,839
Oh! You know, one day,
you are gonna be up
on that wall of fame.

433
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:48,475
I just know it.

434
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:51,678
But you're gonna die first.
[Laughing]

435
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:54,547
I'm not kidding about that,
by the way.

436
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:57,850
Look, Jonah, I appreciate
your hospitality,

437
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:59,719
But I don't wanna
put you out.

438
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:03,390
No, no, no, no, no.
It will be my honor,
good sir.

439
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:06,426
But I do have one question
for you... FM or AM?

440
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:09,662
- What?
- Firm mattress
or air mattress?

441
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,902
- FM it is.
- All right.

442
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:19,105
Cool. Well, you're
probably pretty wiped
from the flight,

443
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:22,875
So why don't you
just kick back, relax?

444
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:25,512
I'm gonna go inside.
My mom's heating up
some pigs in a blanket.

445
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:26,846
And, uh,
I'll be right back.

446
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,051
And, uh, Pepper,
just so you know,

447
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,387
I'm never washing
that sheet again.

448
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:35,922
Ever.

449
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:39,926
You know, I don't think
I actually ever have, so...

450
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:44,063
Okay.

451
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:47,066
Hey, Mom!
Preheat those piggies,
will ya?

452
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,772
[Groans]

453
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,407
Hmm.

454
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,545
[Exhales]

455
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,518
Okay. Here you go.

456
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:08,521
I feel like an idiot.

457
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,557
Well, you look adorable.

458
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,925
Are you sure
this will work?

459
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:15,695
I mean,
what if she already has a date
to the Christmas formal?

460
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,930
No, look, Kenny,
that's not the point.

461
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:19,766
It kind of is.

462
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,034
No, the point is
for her to notice you,

463
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,103
For her to wake up
and realize...

464
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,539
That you could be
the greatest guy she's ever met
in her whole life.

465
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,576
Santa?

466
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,844
No. You.

467
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:35,482
Okay? Now, stick to the plan.
Go get on that curb
and keep your phone close by.

468
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:37,116
- And here's your hat.
- Okay.

469
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,986
You can do this.
You're gonna be great.

470
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,988
[Exhales]

471
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,594
Right there.

472
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:05,111
- [Laughing]
- [Phone Rings]

473
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,946
Oh, hold on, hold on.

474
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,717
Hey, Pepper.
How was your flight?

475
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,219
It crashed
in the Twilight Zone.

476
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:15,722
Come on.
It cannot be that bad.

477
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:18,991
Man, yesterday
I have a hit show,
I'm living like a rock star.

478
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:21,894
Today I'm a has-been.
I'm living in a garage.

479
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:24,497
It's like I've turned
into a TV movie, man.

480
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,065
Will you stop being
so melodramatic?

481
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:27,600
It hasn't even been
24 hours yet.

482
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:28,968
You gotta fix this.

483
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,504
If I stay here much longer,
I'm gonna go crazy.

484
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:34,741
I'm workin' on it.
Oh, and thank you
for regifting those tickets.

485
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:37,076
Yeah. I'm just having
a little pregame cocktail.

486
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,978
Hold on.
Somebody wants to say hi.

487
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,050
Hi, Pepper.
How's it going?

488
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,187
Are you kidding me?

489
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:51,724
Bye.
[Laughing]

490
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,192
- Cheers.
- He is not happy.

491
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,227
He is not happy.

492
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:08,841
[Phone Rings]

493
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,844
[Sandy]
Rudolph to Big Red.

494
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:13,713
The goose is approaching
the oven.

495
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:16,616
- Do you copy?
- What?

496
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:19,686
- No, it means she's on her way.
- Why didn't you just
tell me that?

497
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:21,588
Just get moving.

498
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,832
[Knocking]

499
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,167
- What are you doing here?
- Give it to me straight.

500
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:38,605
Are you really a radio deejay,
or is this just a cover
for your spy gig?

501
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:40,239
Get in the car.

502
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:44,176
You gonna tell me
what's going on?

503
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,846
Okay. Remember
that high school kid
who called into the show?

504
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:50,216
Kenny, that loser you almost
got to humiliate himself? Yeah.

505
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,585
First of all,
he's not a loser.

506
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:56,188
And second,
he's about to get a date
with the girl of his dreams.

507
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:59,626
Please tell me
you did not get involved.

508
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:01,193
Oh, I shouldn't be
getting involved,

509
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,730
But it's okay for you
to turn people
into a punch line...

510
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:05,632
And toss them away
whenever you're done?

511
00:26:05,665 --> 00:26:08,801
We're entertainers.
That's what we do. Come on.

512
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:12,071
Ho, ho, ho.
Well, if it isn't
little Annie Nibough.

513
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:14,073
Hi, Santa.

514
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,742
What you got
in the bag?

515
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:18,711
Oh! Let's take a look.

516
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:21,848
Must be something in here
with your name on it.

517
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:24,016
Well, son of a gun.

518
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,819
[Gasps]
Thank you.

519
00:26:26,853 --> 00:26:28,587
They're really pretty.

520
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:32,158
[Chuckles]

521
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,027
Wait! Uh...

522
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:40,232
Ho-ho-hold on. Almost forgot
the most important part.

523
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:47,940
Well, go on. Open it.

524
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:02,221
Well?

525
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:06,192
Let me think about it.

526
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,440
- Ka-boom.
- [Sandy] Oh, no.

527
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,242
No. I feel so bad.

528
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:25,745
[Pepper]
Oh, hold on.

529
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:27,880
Wait. Wait, wait. Look.

530
00:27:27,914 --> 00:27:29,248
Hey, Kenny.

531
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:38,825
- Yes?
- Yes.

532
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:40,226
Yes!

533
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:51,437
Yes! Yes!

534
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,372
Oh, yes!

535
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,775
Sorry, sucker.

536
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:57,944
Oh, they're so cute.

537
00:27:57,977 --> 00:28:00,246
[Gasps]
Yes.

538
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:08,020
[Sandy]
Well, we are coming up
on 12:00,

539
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:11,257
And we have time
to take one more caller
before we have a little break.

540
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,425
Katrina, you've
been holding a while.

541
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:15,494
What can I help you with
today, Katrina?

542
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,429
[Snoring]

543
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:20,099
Hello. You're on
with Dr. Love.

544
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:22,168
[Boy]
I want to talk to Santa.

545
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,204
Does your mommy know
you're on the phone?

546
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:29,441
She fell asleep.
And she's making funny noises.

547
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:31,477
She certainly
does sound asleep.

548
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,981
Well, you know, Santa
doesn't live here.

549
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:40,252
He's... He's... more
of a North Pole kind of guy.

550
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:42,021
Ho, ho, ho.

551
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:45,825
You know, you're
never gonna believe
who just walked in.

552
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:47,493
- It's him.
- Hello, Santa.

553
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:49,328
It's me, Dex.

554
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:53,833
What? The little dude
with a mother who snores
like a chainsaw?

555
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:56,135
- Yeah!
- All right.

556
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:59,305
Well, I don't have all night.
The reindeers are
gettin' restless.

557
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:01,340
Neigh! Neigh!

558
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:06,045
Which makes them
sound like horses.

559
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:09,849
- Santa?
- Well, for goodness' sake,
what is it now?

560
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:11,784
I love you.

561
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,523
And with that,
we take our first break.

562
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,227
What?

563
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,395
No snarky comeback?

564
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:25,564
Don't tell me
you're getting soft
on me now.

565
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:29,468
With kids,
it's different.

566
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:33,272
All right, people. Chop, chop.
We got two minutes to check
the sizes on these things.

567
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:34,406
What things?

568
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,442
Hello! Costumes!

569
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:39,311
The client sent them over
for your big public appearance
tonight.

570
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:43,349
No one told me
about a public appearance.
That was not cleared with me.

571
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:45,517
Okay, princess,
don't go all diva on me.

572
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:48,454
You got a hit show.
People wanna press the flesh.
Now try 'em on.

573
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:51,457
Pepper, you're gonna look great
in this Joseph thing here.

574
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,525
I think you're gonna
look fabulous as Mary.

575
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:54,894
Yeah?

576
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:56,162
Okay.

577
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:58,430
No.

578
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:04,971
This is it.
My career is officially dead.

579
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:07,539
Look, I know that it's
a little goofy, okay?

580
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:10,076
It's not
the Hollywood Bowl, but,

581
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:12,044
You know, here,
this means a lot.

582
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:13,913
People look forward
to this.

583
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:17,283
Why don't you just
shut your mouth and not
be cynical for once?

584
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,985
Whatever.

585
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:22,955
* [Horns: Fanfare]

586
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:25,357
[Cheering]

587
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:27,593
Whoo!

588
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,304
There were shepherds
in the fields, keeping watch
over their flock by night.

589
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,873
The angel of the Lord
came upon them,

590
00:30:40,907 --> 00:30:42,975
And the glory of the Lord
shone round about them,

591
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,211
And they were
sore afraid.

592
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:49,048
Hey, kid, you okay?

593
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:51,383
- What are you doing?
He's supposed to be afraid.
- Oh.

594
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,185
- Pay attention.
- Sorry.

595
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:54,987
Carry on.

596
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,356
Unto you was born this day,
in the city of David,

597
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,391
A Savior
which is Christ the Lord.

598
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:02,161
And this shall be
a sign unto you...

599
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:13,139
I think I know the story.
Need some help?

600
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:17,576
And there shalt be a sign
and ye shall find a baby
wrapped in swaddling clothes,

601
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,511
Lying in a manger.

602
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:22,181
And suddenly,
there was with the angel,

603
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,484
A multitude
of heavenly hosts
praising God...

604
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,253
And saying...

605
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:29,188
Think you got it
from here?

606
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:36,462
Glory to God in the highest,
and on earth peace,
good will towards men.

607
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:40,499
Whoo! Yeah!
[Laughing]
All right!

608
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:43,569
- Whoo! Good job.
- [Applauding Continues]

609
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,409
So am I done?

610
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:53,445
Nope. Next you're
the bartender
at the reception.

611
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:54,580
Of course.

612
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:57,683
Hi.

613
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,485
There she is.

614
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:02,054
Well, someone turned out
to be the star of the show.

615
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:06,025
Nah, she was the star.
I just had enough sense
to upstage her.

616
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:08,160
You really
took me by surprise.

617
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:10,329
How did you know
all that stuff?

618
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:13,065
What, you think cynics
didn't go to Sunday school?

619
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:15,067
Here.

620
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:18,437
Have some
unnaturally green punch.

621
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,408
Yikes. It looks like
the Grinch died in here.

622
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:27,179
You're gonna need something
to wash down...
the dough balls with.

623
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:29,748
- No, thanks.
- You don't want
salmonella?

624
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,119
You know, I actually had
something a little stronger
in mind.

625
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:34,286
Yeah?

626
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,521
Do you think
you can handle it?

627
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:37,589
Rise up, shepherd,
and follow.

628
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,191
Come on.

629
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,429
- I gotta admit,
you had me fooled.
- Oh, yeah? How?

630
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,364
I just didn't think
you were the type...

631
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,666
To stash a bottle of booze
in the office.

632
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,736
No. It's way better
than that.

633
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:54,106
Aw. Decaf tea bags?

634
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,375
No, I put that on
to ward off intruders.

635
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:58,210
A.k.a. Jonah?

636
00:32:58,244 --> 00:32:59,611
Look inside.

637
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:05,151
Ah. Christmas cookies.

638
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:08,454
With red and green sprinkles.
My mom makes 'em.

639
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,256
- Try one.
- All right.

640
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,763
Mmm. Wow.
That's really good.

641
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:20,232
-[Laughing]
I know.
- Oh, my God.

642
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:23,302
- Good, right?
- I haven't had anything
like this since I moved to L.A.

643
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,138
What?
What are you talking about?
L.A.'s like food heaven.

644
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:29,541
Yeah, with little pastries
made by some guy named Pierre.

645
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:32,644
I mean, seriously,
there's no way I could get
a sugar rush like this.

646
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:35,514
- I'd have to eat, like,
a thousand of those.
- Really?

647
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:38,817
So, how did you make it
out there anyway?

648
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,588
Mmm. It's a pretty
sad story actually.

649
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:46,258
Please.
Big six-figure salary
just for being a goofball?

650
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:48,360
My heart bleeds for you.

651
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:51,197
- You should not
have said that.
- Why?

652
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,499
'Cause now you're
just gonna feel bad
when I tell you the story.

653
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,801
Yeah, right. Try me.

654
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,703
All right.
You asked for it.

655
00:33:57,736 --> 00:34:00,306
So, it's four years ago,

656
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:03,209
And I'm like a semester away
from graduating college.

657
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:05,511
And the whole time I have
this campus radio show, right?

658
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,380
Long hours, no pay.

659
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:11,617
Just me and another guy
doing all the work
because we love it.

660
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:15,287
Except in this case,
the other guy...

661
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:16,522
Is a girl.

662
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:19,291
Is a girl.

663
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:21,093
Carrie Spicer.

664
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:24,430
Sugar and spice
and everything nice.

665
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:27,799
Oh! In unspeakable ways.

666
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:30,836
Oh, wait.
Too much information.

667
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,272
All right.
Moving on.

668
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:36,342
For three years,
we spent pretty much
all of our time...

669
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,377
In the station,

670
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,379
And senior year
rolls around,

671
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,149
And I start making plans.

672
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:47,153
- I buy a ring.
- Wait. This is gonna be
a heartbreak story?

673
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:49,821
Oh, no, no.
I don't wanna hear
a sad story.

674
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:51,657
I compensate by overeating.

675
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,425
Too late.
You can't chicken out.

676
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:55,761
- You gotta listen
to the whole story.
- Oh. Okay.

677
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:59,398
So, I make
elaborate plans...

678
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,267
To ask her
to marry me.

679
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,902
- Stop.
- Live and on air.

680
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,172
- What?
- Yup.

681
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:09,841
So the day comes.
She's back in the booth
when a request comes in.

682
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:12,578
She signals line two.
I think she signals
line three.

683
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:16,548
So, I pick up,
and there's Carrie...

684
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:18,684
On line three,
telling her new guy...

685
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:21,353
How she plans
to leave me.

686
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:24,623
Yikes.

687
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:25,791
Yeah.

688
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,025
What did you do?

689
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,495
Well, I did what any seasoned
radio professional would do.

690
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:32,331
I freaked out
and I went off on her
like a raging lunatic.

691
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:36,202
Did I mention
the mike was still hot?

692
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:39,205
No! Oh, that is not good.

693
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:41,740
Yup. I managed to lose
the love of my life...

694
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:45,544
And get kicked out of school
all on the same day.

695
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:46,845
Want to know
the worst part?

696
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,280
No. Hold on.

697
00:35:49,415 --> 00:35:50,849
Okay. Go.

698
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,352
It was Christmas.

699
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,922
That is the saddest story
I've ever heard.

700
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:59,625
Ah, not really.
The rant went viral.

701
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:03,195
And I'm an immediate
Internet sensation.

702
00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:05,764
And the next thing you know,
I got a six-figure salary...

703
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:07,766
For just being...
What was it
that you called me?

704
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,501
A goofball?

705
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:10,802
[Laughing]
I hate you.

706
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,272
You know
I'm still eating this.
Dare me?

707
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,274
It's all yours.

708
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:20,346
Ah! [Laughing]
The whole bite.

709
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,714
- That is the biggest bite
I've ever seen.
- Mmm.

710
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:28,720
Listen, I've answered
enough questions.

711
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:30,622
It's your turn.

712
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:32,458
Fair enough.

713
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,260
Fire away.

714
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:36,428
- Scared.
- All right.

715
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:38,530
So, the whole
Dr. Love thing.

716
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:41,600
Is that real,
or is it just
a radio deal?

717
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:44,603
Ph.D. in psychology
from Northwestern.

718
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,305
Go, big purple.

719
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:47,773
So you clearly cheated.

720
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:49,575
I did not.

721
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:52,778
I actually graduated
with distinction, so...

722
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:56,515
Okay. Well,
if you're so smart,

723
00:36:56,548 --> 00:37:00,486
Why you hanging out here
with me, freezing your
butt off in Idyllwild?

724
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,721
That is a good question.

725
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:06,525
Um, I had a practice
in Chicago,

726
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,927
And then my dad got sick,

727
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,464
So I moved back here
to be with him and my mom.

728
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:15,634
And he died
eight months ago.

729
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:18,637
Mmm.
[Clicks Tongue]

730
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,006
What?

731
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,543
Can we just take it back
a few seconds right before
I shoved my foot in my mouth?

732
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,878
It's fine.

733
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,282
- I'm sorry.
- Really, no, it's okay.

734
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:34,052
Um, so why don't you just
open up another practice?

735
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,356
Because this here
is mountain country, son,

736
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:41,026
And, well, we folks,
we don't talk about
our feelings.

737
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,861
Plus, I don't know.

738
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:46,298
The radio's
become my practice.

739
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:47,799
So what do you make
of me, Doc?

740
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:50,336
- You?
- Yeah.

741
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:51,770
Ah, you're easy.

742
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,839
Oh, yeah?

743
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:56,442
Guy who got
his heart broken,

744
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:58,544
Who now hides
behind a microphone...

745
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:01,547
'Cause he's scared
of getting hurt again.

746
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,815
Right?

747
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:06,752
Or maybe I'm just
being cautious.

748
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:10,356
You know,
like mature people do.

749
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,294
Well, your time's up.

750
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:19,798
This is my car, so...

751
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:22,033
So, what do I
owe you, Doc?

752
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:24,636
Oh, you can't afford me.

753
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:28,006
You know you're talking
to the second biggest radio star
in Idyllwild, right?

754
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,709
Oh, yeah? Okay.

755
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:33,912
Well, why don't you
make it snow?

756
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:37,749
'Cause it's just not
the same around here
without it.

757
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:39,485
That's a heck of a co-pay.

758
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:42,388
I told you,
I'm not cheap.

759
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:45,824
All right. Well, I guess
this is good night.

760
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:50,396
Um, are you sure
you don't want me
to drive you to Jonah's?

761
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:53,599
No, thanks.
I've gotta work off
all the cookies anyway.

762
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:55,601
Okay.

763
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:57,035
I'll see you tomorrow.

764
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,605
Drive safe.

765
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:08,079
Bye.

766
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:22,027
[Man On Phone]
I've asked her what
she wants for Christmas,

767
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,096
But she just says
she'll be happy with
whatever I get her.

768
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,099
Right. And everybody
who believes that,
raise your third hand.

769
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,402
No, I think what Tom's wife
is trying to say...

770
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:31,937
Is that it's the thought
that matters.

771
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,739
It's not
the gift itself.

772
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:37,809
Okay. Then why don't you
get her a thoughtful set
of snow tires...

773
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:41,012
And watch her light up
when you roll those babies in
on Christmas morning?

774
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:44,049
I'm sure that Tom is thinking
about something a little more
romantic than snow tires.

775
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:46,184
Right, Tom?

776
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,619
Tom?

777
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,559
Well, the radials
are kind of bald.

778
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:57,195
On that note, for calling in,
I'm gonna send you
a jewelry catalog.

779
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,197
That's all the time
we have for today, guys.

780
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,699
This is Dr. Love.

781
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:01,900
And I'm Pepper Sterling.

782
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:04,470
- And we are
signing off.
- Signing off.

783
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:10,676
That's what I'm talking about.
The banter between you two
needs to be more like that.

784
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:13,745
The raise your third hand?
And that jewelry catalog
comeback?

785
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:14,913
That was priceless.

786
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:17,082
What is this?
Armchair analysis?

787
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,687
Well, there's always room
for improvement.

788
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,623
Football coach dissects
game film every night, right?

789
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,858
And I dissected a frog
in biology class,

790
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:28,727
But I swore I'd never
do that again.

791
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,129
All I'm saying is the way
you two guys started,

792
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,532
I didn't know if this
was gonna work or not.

793
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:36,502
Well, even some
of the best marriages
get off to a rocky start.

794
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:39,871
I mean, not that we're
a couple or anything.

795
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,712
[High-pitched]
Awkward.

796
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:49,247
Sandy, I ordered some
of that takeout you love.

797
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,717
It's a nice day.
I thought we'd eat
out in the square.

798
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,653
Oh, um, yeah.
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

799
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:58,189
I'm such an idiot.
Pepper, you wanna join us?

800
00:40:58,223 --> 00:40:59,925
I can order you something.
What do you like?

801
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,059
Nah, I can't do that.

802
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:03,061
Sure you can.
Why not?

803
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:05,531
I made plans already
for lunch.

804
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:08,266
You made plans?
With who?

805
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,002
With your trusty sidekick
in there.

806
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,545
You know what I think about
every time I eat one
of these bad boys?

807
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:21,246
A trip
to the emergency room.

808
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:25,517
No.
Little Lonnie Mills,
WNKW in Mississippi.

809
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:27,686
Soul beast
of the great Southeast.

810
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,855
Oh!
Moment of silence,
please.

811
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:34,292
He choked on a hot dog,
dropped dead right
in the middle of a show.

812
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,994
Dude's a legend.

813
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:38,530
What's going on
with those two?

814
00:41:38,564 --> 00:41:40,932
What, you mean
dull and duller?

815
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:43,168
Best evidence yet
that there is, indeed,
a god.

816
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:44,703
Yeah? How's that?

817
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:46,037
Well, think about it.

818
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:48,874
The two most boring people
in the entire world...

819
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:52,043
Somehow managed
to find each other
in a place like this.

820
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:54,012
I mean, what are the odds?

821
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:56,882
If that's not
divine manipulation,
I don't know what is.

822
00:41:56,915 --> 00:42:01,186
I don't know, man.
Maybe she's just having a tough
time after her dad died.

823
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:03,622
Maybe she just needs
a little bit of fun
in her life.

824
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:06,792
Forget it, man.
She was born without
the fun gene.

825
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:09,127
Oh, dude!
I just got the best idea.

826
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,196
Let's blow off work
and drive to Canada.

827
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:12,931
It's only, like,
14 hours.

828
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:15,901
I got a better idea.
Let's get back
to the hardware store.

829
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,971
How is that better
than Canada?

830
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,212
I got a call
from headquarters
this morning.

831
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:29,648
Oh, no. Who are they
unloading on us now?

832
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:31,950
Actually,
it was about me
this time.

833
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:34,686
They are considering me
for a job in Dallas.

834
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,756
What? Wow!

835
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:40,626
Cole, that's amazing.
Congratulations.

836
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:43,128
It's not a sure thing yet
and I'm sure they have
a lot of candidates,

837
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:45,664
But if it does happen,

838
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:47,899
I want you to think
about coming with me.

839
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,771
Wow. Um...

840
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:57,676
I don't know what to say.

841
00:42:57,709 --> 00:42:59,945
I believe
in your talent.

842
00:42:59,978 --> 00:43:03,114
Sandy,
I think you'd be a huge hit
in a market like Dallas.

843
00:43:03,148 --> 00:43:05,917
And, yes,

844
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:08,586
The fact of the matter is
I would like to
keep seeing you.

845
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:12,257
I'm just asking you
to think about it.

846
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:35,246
Oh! Margaret!
I'm so sorry.

847
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,949
- That's okay.
- I'm sorry.

848
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:42,287
Okay. Sorry.

849
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:47,025
Oh, my gosh.
I have not been late
like this since college.

850
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:49,194
It's all right.
You still got 15 seconds.

851
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:50,729
Get your feet
out of my chair!

852
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:54,432
All right. Now that
the queen has arrived,
let's make some radio history.

853
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,402
- Live in five.
- Oh, I just gotta
catch my breath.

854
00:43:57,435 --> 00:44:01,673
And now, your number one
talk radio show,

855
00:44:01,707 --> 00:44:06,311
Dr. Love in the Mornings,
with special guest,
Pepper Sterling!

856
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:08,880
What's going on, Idyllwild?
Happy holidays.

857
00:44:08,914 --> 00:44:10,949
We'll get to your calls
in a few minutes,

858
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:14,319
But first
here's a little something
to get you in the mood.

859
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:16,955
- [Deck the Halls plays]
- Wait. Wait, what?

860
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:20,025
I got a surprise for you
in your office.

861
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:22,193
Are you crazy?
We can't just walk out
on a show.

862
00:44:22,227 --> 00:44:24,429
We can for three minutes
and 17 seconds,

863
00:44:24,462 --> 00:44:26,898
Which is exactly how long
the song lasts.

864
00:44:26,932 --> 00:44:29,200
- Come on.
- You know we're not
gonna make out.

865
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:31,770
It's not about that
this time. Follow me.

866
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,308
[Giggles]

867
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:46,284
Go ahead, open it.

868
00:44:49,888 --> 00:44:51,790
[Sandy Laughing]

869
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:54,059
So, what do you think?

870
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:57,495
You filled my office
with packing peanuts.

871
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,297
[Laughs]

872
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,032
You said you wanted snow.

873
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:02,934
Well, now you got snow.

874
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:06,738
Well, I mean,
it is actually
kind of amazing.

875
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:08,106
[Both Shouting]

876
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:09,841
You're gonna pay for that.

877
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,476
[Scoffs]
Hey.

878
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:13,344
- Oh, my God.
- Get back here.

879
00:45:23,488 --> 00:45:26,792
No! [Laughing]

880
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,497
[Muffled Laughing]

881
00:45:41,807 --> 00:45:43,008
[Roars]
[Screams]

882
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,852
Take a good look
at your face.

883
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:03,328
See?
It's just like snow.

884
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:05,396
Yeah.

885
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:11,102
Let's tie it.

886
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,209
[Giggles]
Looks good.

887
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:22,948
- Oh...
- The show.

888
00:46:27,853 --> 00:46:29,220
[Laughs]

889
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,990
[Sandy]
Ah!

890
00:46:33,158 --> 00:46:36,995
And we're back.
I'm Dr. Sandra Love...

891
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:39,831
And I'm college dropout
Pepper Sterling.

892
00:46:39,865 --> 00:46:41,266
Jonah,
who's our first caller?

893
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:45,136
[Jonah]
Up first we have "do that again
and I'll crush you both."

894
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:48,006
Go ahead, caller.
You're on with Dr. Love.

895
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:49,307
Oh, my God.
[Chuckles]

896
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,609
[Clears Throat]

897
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,311
[Laughs]
Well...

898
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:55,446
Looks like
you missed a peanut.

899
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,115
You don't mean snow?

900
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,349
Yeah, I mean snow.

901
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,152
I had fun today.

902
00:47:01,186 --> 00:47:03,454
Yeah, yeah.
It was a good show.

903
00:47:07,092 --> 00:47:09,627
All right, well, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go.

904
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,997
[Chuckles]
All right.

905
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,199
If you're not
doing anything...

906
00:47:14,232 --> 00:47:17,302
Other than rearranging
Jonah's sock drawer... nada.

907
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:20,005
Well, my mom and I
were gonna go pick out
our Christmas tree,

908
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:22,473
If you wanna come along.

909
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:25,443
Who, me? The overpaid
Cro-Magnon twit?

910
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:28,914
We need a little
caveman muscle.

911
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:31,216
Any opportunity to show off
these massive guns.

912
00:47:31,249 --> 00:47:33,384
I'm in. Let's do this.

913
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:35,086
Go get in the car.

914
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:44,029
Hey, do me a favor
and be nice to my mom. Okay?

915
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:48,033
It's our first Christmas
without my Dad,
so she's a little fragile.

916
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:53,204
Yeah,
she seems real fragile.

917
00:47:53,238 --> 00:47:55,606
- Katherine Love.
Call me Kate.
- Hi.

918
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,642
- Hi.
- I'm Pepper.

919
00:47:57,675 --> 00:48:02,480
- You're that radio guy.
I like you. You're spunky.
- Yeah, that's me.

920
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:05,616
I hope you don't mind
that I invited him
to come cut a tree with us.

921
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,953
Yeah, that's great.
We could use the help.

922
00:48:07,986 --> 00:48:10,055
- You got gloves?
- No.

923
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:12,390
Oh, well,
you'll need these.

924
00:48:18,496 --> 00:48:21,699
All right. Be careful.

925
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,669
Let's go cut a tree.

926
00:48:24,702 --> 00:48:27,072
-[Kate]
Come on.
-[Both Laughing]

927
00:48:29,474 --> 00:48:31,342
[Pepper]
Aren't you guys freezing?

928
00:48:31,376 --> 00:48:33,478
[Kate Scoffs]
You're not used
to the cold, huh?

929
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:36,614
Okay, you guys.
Let's pick it up.
We're losing light.

930
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,616
So, you kill
for your own food too?

931
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,518
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

932
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:43,421
I got a possum in the oven.
Hope you're hungry.

933
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:49,027
Hey, guys. That's it.
Right there.

934
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,430
[Kate]
Oh, that's pretty.
That's a good tree.

935
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:54,132
Do you approve of this one?

936
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:55,633
[Pepper]
It's so shiny.

937
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,502
Yeah. I made it.

938
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:59,137
It's cute.
I like it.

939
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,974
- It's pretty colorful.
- Thank you.

940
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:07,645
Hmm.
So, what do you think,

941
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:10,715
Little snowman thing
or baby's first Christmas?

942
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:13,985
I like both.
I say put both.

943
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:17,088
Yeah? All right.
You're the one who's
gotta live with it.

944
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:18,623
- Pepper?
- Yeah.

945
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:21,126
Um, where are you
spending Christmas?

946
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:24,495
I hadn't thought about it.
I wasn't sure how long
I was gonna be here.

947
00:49:24,529 --> 00:49:26,731
Well, if you're still here,

948
00:49:26,764 --> 00:49:28,966
We'd love to have you
spend it with us.

949
00:49:30,235 --> 00:49:32,003
Only if you cook up
another possum.

950
00:49:32,037 --> 00:49:34,039
That thing was incredible.

951
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:36,407
Little secret...
It was brisket.

952
00:49:36,441 --> 00:49:37,742
Aw, don't tell me that.

953
00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:41,446
Makes me feel more manly
to think I ate a giant rat.

954
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:44,382
Okay, what happened here?

955
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:49,054
[Laughs]
You know, I love this one.

956
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:52,523
I made it in second grade.
It's a reindeer.

957
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:54,625
Maybe after he got hit
by a truck.

958
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,027
What?

959
00:49:56,061 --> 00:49:59,197
All right, we're gonna
put this guy back here
so nobody sees him.

960
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,166
No, that is so mean.
He goes in the front.

961
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:02,700
No, this is for his own good.

962
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:05,703
- This way no one will
make fun of him. Okay?
- Stop being so controlling.

963
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,638
Oh, you're calling me
controlling?

964
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:09,074
- I mean...
- Wow.

965
00:50:09,107 --> 00:50:12,277
- Yeah, you're a little...
- Excuse me, guys.
I'll be back in a minute.

966
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:17,448
I'm gonna go and check on her.
I'll be right back, okay?

967
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:18,649
Yeah.

968
00:50:25,723 --> 00:50:29,260
Hey.
Mom, what's wrong?

969
00:50:29,294 --> 00:50:31,162
Nothing. Really, I'm good.

970
00:50:31,196 --> 00:50:32,497
I'm so sorry.

971
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,466
I never should have
brought him here
without asking you first.

972
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,070
Are you kidding me?
No, I'm glad that you did.

973
00:50:39,104 --> 00:50:41,506
It's like spending Christmas
with your dad.

974
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:44,209
Mom, Pepper
is nothing like Dad.

975
00:50:44,242 --> 00:50:46,511
[Scoffs]
Who are you kidding?

976
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:50,281
He is exactly like your dad.
No wonder you like him so much.

977
00:50:50,315 --> 00:50:52,583
I never said that I like him.

978
00:50:52,617 --> 00:50:55,120
You didn't have to.

979
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:59,157
Okay, Mom, look, he's funny
and he's fun to be around,

980
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:01,526
But... that's it.

981
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,795
He's not substantial.
He's not like Dad.

982
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:08,466
Trust me,
it's nothing serious.

983
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:11,236
You make your dad
sound so serious.

984
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:13,104
Well, what's wrong with that?

985
00:51:13,138 --> 00:51:16,274
Nothing, as long
as you're not boring.

986
00:51:16,307 --> 00:51:21,112
I don't think you remember
how silly Dad used to be
with us...

987
00:51:21,146 --> 00:51:24,182
And how much he could
make us laugh.

988
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:30,155
You gotta remember
to have fun and let go.

989
00:51:30,188 --> 00:51:32,123
Now you sound like Pepper.

990
00:51:32,157 --> 00:51:34,459
Then you should
listen to him.

991
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:43,234
Okay, you've got a guest,
and I know it's time for me
to get lost.

992
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:47,305
Mom. I love you.

993
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:50,708
[Laughs]

994
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:02,587
Sorry.

995
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,821
Did I upset her?

996
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:08,193
No. No, on the contrary.
She...

997
00:52:08,226 --> 00:52:10,228
She adores you.

998
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:12,297
You made her really happy.

999
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:15,633
And me too.
So, thank you.

1000
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:17,868
Well, I have
a confession to make.

1001
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:19,704
Oh, no.
What did you do now?

1002
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:21,739
- Steal the family silver?
- Worse.

1003
00:52:21,772 --> 00:52:22,807
What?

1004
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,041
So, that tree over there?

1005
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:27,312
That's not the only thing I
cut down with a chainsaw today.

1006
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:29,947
What is it with men
and power tools?

1007
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,783
You guys, like,
turn into little boys.

1008
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:35,853
Little boys that can't stop
thinking about little girls.

1009
00:52:39,957 --> 00:52:44,429
Are you mad at me
for cutting this down too?

1010
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:51,168
I guess...
only if you waste it.

1011
00:53:14,592 --> 00:53:17,428
[Sandy]
Most often,
in situations like this,

1012
00:53:17,462 --> 00:53:20,398
My advice
would be to avoid...

1013
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:22,267
- Stop that right now.
- No.

1014
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,535
All, am... uh, you know...

1015
00:53:24,569 --> 00:53:26,771
-Ambiguous psychological
functioning...
-[Pops]

1016
00:53:26,804 --> 00:53:31,576
That would manifest itself
in our, um...

1017
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:34,845
In our... our dream state.
[Whispers]
Stop.

1018
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:36,581
How does that sound?

1019
00:53:36,614 --> 00:53:38,316
[Male Caller]
Like you're psychotic.

1020
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:41,386
I just asked if I should tip
the trash guy at Christmas.

1021
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:43,788
Well, I'm sure that...

1022
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:46,257
It will make
a lot more sense...

1023
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:48,959
Once you've
thought about it.

1024
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:51,462
Jonah, who's
our next caller?

1025
00:53:51,496 --> 00:53:56,301
Oh, uh, up next we have
Buddy from the
Golden Acres Retirement Home.

1026
00:53:56,334 --> 00:53:59,770
Oh, um, it's always a pleasure
to welcome a senior
onto our show.

1027
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:03,274
Uh, can I ask how old you are?
[Whispers]
Don't.

1028
00:54:03,308 --> 00:54:05,843
-[Buddy]
I'll be 93 in January.
-[Pops]

1029
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:09,847
Wow, almost 93. That's...
Congratulations.

1030
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,418
Um, what's on your mind today,
Buddy?

1031
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:15,486
- [Buddy] Sex.
- Sex?

1032
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,054
Sex?

1033
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,856
Yeah, yeah. Sex.

1034
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:20,825
Talk to me, caller.
What's going on?

1035
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:24,962
Okay. Well, not too long ago
my wife talked me into...

1036
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:28,299
Getting one of those
stint thingies.

1037
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:30,000
You know, to open up the valve
in the old ticker?

1038
00:54:30,034 --> 00:54:32,837
I gotta say,
I feel like a new man.

1039
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:36,541
And not just
in the heart department,
if you know what I mean.

1040
00:54:36,574 --> 00:54:38,976
Yes, yes. We...
We know what you mean.

1041
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:43,814
Um, so I'm guessing
your question is if it's okay
to resume having sex?

1042
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:47,352
Wouldn't you after 37 years?

1043
00:54:47,385 --> 00:54:51,088
In my professional opinion,
I think you should consult
your doctor...

1044
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,758
And have a full work-up
before any vigorous activity...

1045
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,461
Just to make sure
that your heart and...

1046
00:54:56,494 --> 00:54:59,063
Other parts
are working correctly.

1047
00:54:59,096 --> 00:55:03,868
Buddy, you're 92 years old.
Forget the work-up.

1048
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:07,004
- What?
- Look, you're already playing
with house money.

1049
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:10,441
Come on. Get moving.
Ticktock. Time's a wastin'.

1050
00:55:10,475 --> 00:55:13,411
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen. Right?

1051
00:55:13,444 --> 00:55:15,546
[Bell Tolls]

1052
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,448
[Microphone Popping]

1053
00:55:17,482 --> 00:55:20,851
Um, hello?
[Clears Throat]

1054
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,456
You know,
I barely knew Buddy,

1055
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:29,394
But during one of
our most recent talks...

1056
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:34,899
Okay, our only talk...

1057
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:37,902
I got to see that Buddy
was a great person.

1058
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:39,904
Somebody who loved life...

1059
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:43,641
And loved the person
he shared it with.

1060
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:46,511
And who can ask for anything
more than that?

1061
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:06,631
Ma'am, I can't tell you
how incredibly sorry I am.

1062
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:08,799
I just... I feel awful about
what happened to your husband.

1063
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,735
Oh, it's okay, sweetie.

1064
00:56:10,768 --> 00:56:14,104
Buddy and I had
a wonderful life together.

1065
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:19,043
And I want you to know
he died a very happy man.

1066
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:22,079
[Both Chuckling]
Well, it's always good
to go out on a high note.

1067
00:56:26,551 --> 00:56:29,454
Mrs. Crutchfield,
now what would Buddy think?

1068
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:31,856
Who cares? He's dead.

1069
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:35,560
Like you say, at my age,
there's no time to waste.

1070
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:38,529
All right, then.
So you wanna dance
with an old fart like me?

1071
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:40,030
[Laughing]
Can you keep up?

1072
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:42,467
[Pepper]
No, can you keep up?

1073
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,470
I like your moves.

1074
00:56:45,503 --> 00:56:48,506
-[Cackling]
- Whoa, you're getting away
from me.

1075
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:50,575
[Mrs. Crutchfield]
Whoo-whoo. Grandma nothin'.

1076
00:56:50,608 --> 00:56:53,744
Whoo-whee!

1077
00:56:53,778 --> 00:56:56,080
I got all kinds
of surprises, little boy.

1078
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:59,984
-[Pepper]
One handed, huh? Oh!
- Just let me show you my stuff.

1079
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:01,952
And here it comes.

1080
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:04,822
Whoa.
[Laughing]

1081
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:09,627
- Well, look what heaven
dropped into my lap.
- Shut up and dance.

1082
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,497
All right.

1083
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:15,900
I had no idea memorials
could be so much fun.

1084
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:22,807
Wanna dance?

1085
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,809
You sure you're up for it?

1086
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:28,012
You probably ought to get
a full work-up before
any vigorous activities.

1087
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:30,915
[Both Chuckling]

1088
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:48,799
[Pepper]
I'm telling ya, that old lady
was pretty into me.

1089
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:50,601
[Sandy]
You know,
she just lost her husband.

1090
00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:52,269
[Jonah]
Rebound relationship.
She's using you, man.

1091
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,872
Well, here I am,
my blue-haired vixen.

1092
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:57,174
Come and use me up.

1093
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:07,251
-[Pepper] With the chess
pieces all in the punch.
-[Jonah Laughing]

1094
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:10,254
- Hi.
- Hey. Looks like I missed
a heck of a party.

1095
00:58:10,287 --> 00:58:14,592
- Oh, you have no idea.
- The prune pudding was
the bomb diggity.

1096
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:16,761
I can't even get that taste
out of my mouth.

1097
00:58:16,794 --> 00:58:19,096
Pepper, can I have you
come to my office for a second?

1098
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:21,198
Just come on in
and close the door.

1099
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:23,934
Ooh.

1100
00:58:23,968 --> 00:58:25,603
Yeah, sure.

1101
00:58:28,072 --> 00:58:29,540
Just Pepper.

1102
00:58:29,574 --> 00:58:32,577
- Oh, you didn't want
to see us?
- No.

1103
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,144
Okay, all right.
Good luck, Pepper.

1104
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,146
[Scoffs]

1105
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,616
Love you.

1106
00:58:38,649 --> 00:58:39,750
So, what's up?

1107
00:58:42,086 --> 00:58:44,288
Headquarters called.
They want you back on the air.

1108
00:58:46,724 --> 00:58:50,094
- Since when?
- Since their ratings dropped
four percent.

1109
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,599
So just like that,
I'm out of the penalty box?

1110
00:58:54,632 --> 00:58:56,734
Yeah. A dip in ad revenue
will do that.

1111
00:58:58,636 --> 00:59:00,738
They, uh... They're sending
a plane tomorrow.

1112
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:03,674
They want you back
by Christmas Day.

1113
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:07,745
Christmas Day? No.
I-I can't do that to Sandy.

1114
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,782
I'm confused.
I thought you couldn't wait
to get out of here.

1115
00:59:11,816 --> 00:59:14,852
Yeah, no. Um...
Yeah, it's great.

1116
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,187
Look, can you do me a favor
and just...

1117
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:20,691
Not say anything
to Sandy?

1118
00:59:20,725 --> 00:59:22,059
I wanna tell her myself.

1119
00:59:27,097 --> 00:59:29,634
Pepper,
she means a lot to me.

1120
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:32,937
Probably a lot more
than I mean to her.

1121
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:34,639
Don't hurt her.

1122
00:59:46,684 --> 00:59:50,721
All right. Sandy and Pepper
in the Morning's promo,
take four.

1123
00:59:50,755 --> 00:59:54,625
This is KZJJ 99.6,

1124
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:57,127
Home of Sandy and Pepper
in the Morning.

1125
01:00:00,698 --> 01:00:02,900
- How was that?
- Inspired.

1126
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:06,837
Hey. What do you think?

1127
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:10,708
What happened to
Dr. Love with special guest
Pepper Sterling?

1128
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:14,211
I guess I'm getting
used to sharing.

1129
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:17,314
We were just playing around
with a couple things,
seeing how stuff sounds.

1130
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:18,348
We should have Pepper
do one.

1131
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:19,684
I'll do one in a minute.

1132
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:23,387
Um, Jonah,
can we get a second?

1133
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:25,956
[Whispers]
Yeah.

1134
01:00:29,894 --> 01:00:33,363
Hey.
What happened in there?

1135
01:00:33,397 --> 01:00:35,332
Nothing. Um, I'm fine.

1136
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,101
It's just...

1137
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:38,836
I think there's something
we need to talk about.

1138
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:41,972
What is it?

1139
01:00:42,006 --> 01:00:45,843
- Um...
- Pepper, just say it.

1140
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:47,344
Well...

1141
01:00:48,913 --> 01:00:50,881
Yeah. I just...

1142
01:00:57,855 --> 01:01:01,191
I was wondering if you wanted
to go to the company Christmas
party with me.

1143
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:07,097
I mean, sure, but we don't...

1144
01:01:07,131 --> 01:01:09,433
We don't have
a company Christmas party.

1145
01:01:09,466 --> 01:01:14,038
I'm talking about the one
on Sunday in California.

1146
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:17,808
Wait, are you kidding? L.A.?

1147
01:01:19,376 --> 01:01:21,979
- Are you kidding?
- No, I mean, I know
it's short notice...

1148
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:24,815
And you probably have some,
like, trees to chop down
or something...

1149
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:28,085
No, shut up.
I mean, what about the show?

1150
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:31,789
Well, we can have
a company plane pick us up
right after the show,

1151
01:01:31,822 --> 01:01:34,291
And then we'll be back
in time the next morning.

1152
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:37,027
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you joking?

1153
01:01:37,061 --> 01:01:39,363
I mean,
L.A. and a private plane?

1154
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:40,430
There's one catch.

1155
01:01:40,464 --> 01:01:41,766
What?

1156
01:01:41,799 --> 01:01:43,934
You gotta be my date.

1157
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:47,772
- [Squealing, Laughing]
- Yeah?

1158
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:48,939
[Kisses]

1159
01:01:48,973 --> 01:01:50,975
I guess that means
you'll think about it?

1160
01:02:04,488 --> 01:02:07,157
- It's an experience.

1162
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,431
Thanks.

1164
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:24,041
- And one point... Pepper.
- [Shouts]

1165
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:25,309
Can we take a picture?

1166
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:27,812
Aw, sure, why not?

1168
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,182
Whoa.

-[Sandy]
This mansion is your house?
-[Engine Off]

1170
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:55,372
Yep.
[Chuckles]

1171
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:57,574
- Show me.
- There's nothing
to see.

1172
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,176
It's just a bunch
of empty rooms.

1173
01:03:01,478 --> 01:03:03,914
- Jimmy.
- Welcome home, Mr. Sterling.

1174
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:05,415
Hey. Hey, can you throw that
in the back for us?

1175
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:06,917
Sure thing.

1176
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:08,352
- Thanks.
- There you go.

1177
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:09,820
- Hi.
- Hi.

1178
01:03:09,854 --> 01:03:12,089
- I'll see you
in a little bit.
- Okay.

1179
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:16,093
- Okay, who was that?
- Ah, that's Jimmy,
my house manager.

1180
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:19,396
Are there any other
people in the entourage
I need to know about?

1181
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:20,931
That's it.

1182
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:23,934
So, are you gonna tell me
what's in that basket?

1183
01:03:23,968 --> 01:03:26,937
Now, now,
have a little patience.
You'll see.

1184
01:03:48,025 --> 01:03:50,094
- Let's put our stuff
right here.
- Okay.

1185
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:57,634
So, do you always have
your minions pack you
a nice little picnic?

1186
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:00,537
Oh, this isn't a picnic.
It's way better than that.

1187
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:01,638
- Oh, yeah?
- Yep.

1188
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,307
We're gonna
make a snowman.

1189
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,608
L.A.-style.

1190
01:04:04,641 --> 01:04:06,310
Uh, what are we gonna
use for snow?

1191
01:04:07,644 --> 01:04:09,013
We're gonna use sand.

1192
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,415
[Pepper]
Voilà.

1193
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:13,250
[Giggling]

1194
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:16,086
What else do you have in here?

1195
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,587
Yeah, we got
some shovels for ya.

1196
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:22,226
Yeah, instead of it melting,
the high tide just washes it
back out to sea.

1197
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:26,596
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

1198
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:28,933
Why on earth would someone
as incredible as you...

1199
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:31,101
Stick around
in Idyllwild, Colorado?

1200
01:04:31,135 --> 01:04:34,238
Well, you know,
my mom's cookies are
a big selling point.

1201
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:35,639
Okay.

1202
01:04:37,141 --> 01:04:40,444
Come on.
I'm being serious.

1203
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:42,913
What? I mean, I told you.

1204
01:04:42,947 --> 01:04:45,482
I moved home to be with my mom
when my dad got sick.

1205
01:04:45,515 --> 01:04:47,351
Nope. I don't buy it.

1206
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,119
Your mom can
take care of herself.

1207
01:04:49,153 --> 01:04:51,688
Who said anything about
taking care of her?

1208
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,657
I said, "being with her."

1209
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:56,393
You know, breathing
the same air as her.

1210
01:04:56,426 --> 01:04:58,495
Sharing the same space.

1211
01:04:58,528 --> 01:05:00,397
It's what you do when
you love someone else.

1212
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,666
You want to be around them
all the time.

1213
01:05:06,971 --> 01:05:09,439
[Sighs]
We need to talk about
the Christmas party.

1214
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:13,010
You know, I think
he's missing something.

1215
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:15,645
I'll be right back.
Hold on.

1216
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,416
Sandy, what...

1217
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,219
Wait a sec.

1218
01:05:25,322 --> 01:05:28,525
Pepper?
Pepper.

1219
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:31,561
Man, why didn't you call me?
I would've picked you up
at the airport, brother.

1220
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:33,063
Look, we got a lot
to talk about.

1221
01:05:33,097 --> 01:05:34,564
Yeah, yeah, I know. I just...

1222
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:37,167
I got a friend in town and
I'm just showing her around.

1223
01:05:37,201 --> 01:05:38,635
It's her first
time here, so...

1224
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:39,970
Oh, nice.

1225
01:05:40,004 --> 01:05:43,273
You tell her her tour guide
is about to become
the king of L.A.

1226
01:05:43,307 --> 01:05:44,741
[Scoffs]
What are you talking about?

1227
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,111
Ratings have been so bad
since you left...

1228
01:05:47,144 --> 01:05:49,446
That they are desperate
to get you back on the air, man.

1229
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:50,747
Look, have you seen these?

1230
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,815
What?

1231
01:05:51,848 --> 01:05:54,184
They are blanketing
the whole city with those...

1232
01:05:54,218 --> 01:05:56,620
Billboards, bus stops,
everything.

1233
01:05:59,256 --> 01:06:01,291
Wow, I guess they really
did miss me, huh?

1234
01:06:01,325 --> 01:06:03,393
I mean, they never spent
this kind of money before.

1235
01:06:03,427 --> 01:06:06,063
That, my friend,
is what I call "leverage,"

1236
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:08,632
And my two favorite words
in the whole English language...

1237
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:11,101
Are "re" and "negotiation."

1238
01:06:11,135 --> 01:06:13,737
-[Laughs]
- Turning lemons
into lemonade, huh?

1239
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:15,639
It's what I do, baby.

1240
01:06:15,672 --> 01:06:17,274
I'll call you tomorrow.
All right?

1241
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,381
Hey. Who was that?

1242
01:06:24,414 --> 01:06:27,117
Oh, that's my buddy,
Morris.

1243
01:06:30,287 --> 01:06:31,755
All right. There.

1244
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:35,025
Perfect.

1245
01:06:35,059 --> 01:06:37,327
Yeah, I guess it is,
isn't it?

1246
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:46,570
It's sort of sad that this
is all gonna be washed away
by tomorrow, isn't it?

1247
01:06:50,474 --> 01:06:52,109
Are you okay?

1248
01:07:07,324 --> 01:07:09,659
This is her, right?

1249
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:12,196
Your girlfriend?

1250
01:07:12,229 --> 01:07:14,564
- Your make-out buddy?
- Okay, it's not
like that.

1251
01:07:14,598 --> 01:07:17,167
I promise,
it's not like that.

1252
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:19,536
Why did you even
bring me here?

1253
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:21,338
I think you should
let me explain.

1254
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:27,077
There's no need to.
That... That says it all.

1255
01:07:27,111 --> 01:07:29,113
- Congratulations.
You're back.
- Sandy...

1256
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:31,381
No, now you get to
go back to real life.

1257
01:07:31,415 --> 01:07:34,184
When were you gonna tell me
about this?

1258
01:07:34,218 --> 01:07:36,753
At the party, or...

1259
01:07:38,422 --> 01:07:39,756
Wait...

1260
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:42,759
There...
There is a party, right?

1261
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,261
No.

1262
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,601
I feel so stupid.

1263
01:07:51,635 --> 01:07:53,637
I was gonna tell you.
In fact, I tried...

1264
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:56,106
Has anything that
you've said been true?

1265
01:07:57,474 --> 01:07:59,443
You know what?
It doesn't even matter now.

1266
01:07:59,476 --> 01:08:01,711
Because, you know, I'm not
one of your callers, right?

1267
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:04,348
Like, you know you can't just
use me for entertainment

1268
01:08:04,381 --> 01:08:06,516
And then disconnect from me
whenever you're done.

1269
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:08,752
You knew this
was gonna happen. Come on.

1270
01:08:08,785 --> 01:08:12,122
I mean, now... a month from now...
at some point, they were gonna
bring me back here.

1271
01:08:12,156 --> 01:08:14,458
So then why do all this
with me?

1272
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:16,126
What do you want me
to say?

1273
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,195
I have a deal with these people.

1274
01:08:18,228 --> 01:08:19,896
Okay?
I made a commitment.

1275
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,665
You may have a deal
with these people,

1276
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:24,268
But you know nothing
about commitment.

1277
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:29,506
Sandy.

1278
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:32,142
Sandy, I'm sorry.

1279
01:08:32,176 --> 01:08:33,877
Where are you even gonna go?

1280
01:08:39,216 --> 01:08:40,584

[Carrie]
Welcome back to Pepper
and Spice in the Morning.

1282
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:08,445
We would like to thank
our special guest Rat Mutants...

1283
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,447
For stopping by
on Christmas Day.

1284
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,251
The final show of Rat Mutants'
Merry Metal Christmas Tour...

1285
01:09:14,284 --> 01:09:17,721
Is tonight, and I'm told
you guys have got some
surprises up your sleeve.

1286
01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:21,225
Yeah, I'm performing
a special mash-up...

1287
01:09:21,258 --> 01:09:23,927
Of "Jingle Bells"
and "Putrefied Maggots."

1288
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,796
Can't get more Christmassy
than that, right?

1289
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,632
[No Audible Dialogue]

1290
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:30,867
So, um, I've got to tell you...

1291
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,437
When Pepper and I
were in college,

1292
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:36,473
We absolutely loved
your first album.

1293
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:39,309
Especially the third track.
I, uh, I can't remember
the name of it,

1294
01:09:39,343 --> 01:09:41,345
But I do know that we
made out to it...

1295
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:43,713
For 12 minutes
and 11 seconds.

1296
01:09:43,747 --> 01:09:45,615
I get that a lot.

1297
01:09:45,649 --> 01:09:47,651
Apparently that tune
helped breed us...

1298
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:50,320
A whole new generation of fans.

1299
01:09:50,354 --> 01:09:52,489
Well, I bet you Pepper
remembers the name of the track.

1300
01:09:57,594 --> 01:10:00,730
- Pepper?
- Just a college
thing, sweetie.

1301
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:02,499
Long time ago.

1302
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:05,669
Talk to me, Morris.
What's going on here?

1303
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,404
Uh, he's just a little
out of sync.

1304
01:10:07,437 --> 01:10:09,239
- He'll get it back.
- Yeah, well, he better.

1305
01:10:09,273 --> 01:10:10,940
You know, we didn't
double his salary for this.

1306
01:10:10,974 --> 01:10:12,776
And that's going to wrap
things up for today.

1307
01:10:12,809 --> 01:10:13,843
I'm Carrie.

1308
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:15,845
And I'm outta here.

1309
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,682
[Carrie]
And we'll be back tomorrow...

1310
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:20,884
With more Pepper
and Spice in the Morning.

1311
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:22,852
And we're out.

1312
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:25,389
Will somebody please tell me
what's going on?

1313
01:10:25,422 --> 01:10:27,891
Okay, you tell him
that I want to see him
in my office, now.

1314
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:29,559
No worries.
I'll talk to him.

1315
01:10:31,695 --> 01:10:33,663
Pepper!

1317
01:10:35,031 --> 01:10:36,900
What are you trying
to do, man. Huh?

1318
01:10:36,933 --> 01:10:38,502
Get yourself kicked off
the air again?

1319
01:10:38,535 --> 01:10:39,736
Back off.

1320
01:10:39,769 --> 01:10:41,338
I just... I can't think
straight right now.

1321
01:10:41,371 --> 01:10:42,806
Oh, clearly.

1322
01:10:42,839 --> 01:10:45,008
Look, I'll get it together.
I promise.

1323
01:10:47,777 --> 01:10:50,447
[Sighs]
Okay.

1324
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,282
Come on, Sandy.

1326
01:10:55,652 --> 01:10:58,488
[Sandy: Recording]
Hi, you've reached Sandy's
cell phone. Leave a message.

1327
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:09,933
Okay, this is a special one
for you.

1328
01:11:09,966 --> 01:11:12,736
- Mom!
- But it... Oh, turn it
like that.

1329
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,404
It's no big deal.
You'll see.

1330
01:11:14,438 --> 01:11:15,739
What did you
get me?

1331
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,474
Hmm.

1332
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:24,414
Oh...
[Laughs]
It's my little reindeer.

1333
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:28,852
[Kate]
Pepper was right.
Poor thing was falling apart...

1334
01:11:28,885 --> 01:11:31,921
And there's no way
I could ever get rid of that.

1335
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,791
Thank you.

1336
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:38,962
Look, I know you're
going through so much
right now,

1337
01:11:38,995 --> 01:11:42,966
And I'm so sorry.

1338
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:45,101
Oh, Mom.
[Laughing, Crying]

1339
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,936
Oh.

1340
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:51,541
I'm gonna go make us
a pot of coffee,
and we're gonna talk.

1341
01:11:51,575 --> 01:11:53,910
- Okay?
- Okay.

1342
01:12:00,517 --> 01:12:01,951
[Vibrates]

1343
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:06,956
[Knocking On Door]

1344
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:13,830
Merry Christmas.

1345
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:17,033
Cole. Hi.

1346
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:18,702
Merry Christmas.

1347
01:12:18,735 --> 01:12:21,538
Yeah, something tells me
I'm not who you were
hoping for.

1348
01:12:23,106 --> 01:12:25,742
No, no.
It's nothing like that.

1349
01:12:25,775 --> 01:12:27,010
Come in.

1350
01:12:28,144 --> 01:12:30,614
I just dropped by
to bring you this.

1351
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:33,517
You didn't have
to get me a gift.

1352
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:35,719
Well, just open it.

1353
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:39,055
Okay.

1354
01:12:44,961 --> 01:12:46,763
- Cowboy boots.
- [Both Laughing]

1355
01:12:46,796 --> 01:12:48,598
Wow.

1356
01:12:48,632 --> 01:12:50,934
You know, I think this might be
the first time...

1357
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:52,936
Anyone's every given me
a pair of these.

1358
01:12:52,969 --> 01:12:54,971
Okay, but they're
sort of symbolic.

1359
01:12:55,004 --> 01:12:57,073
I got a call
from the network last night,

1360
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:58,808
And they want me in Dallas
tomorrow night.

1361
01:13:00,644 --> 01:13:03,980
You got the job. That's...
That's fantastic.

1362
01:13:04,013 --> 01:13:06,583
And I still, uh,
mean what I said.

1363
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:07,917
I hope you come with me.

1364
01:13:10,487 --> 01:13:11,921
Cole, h-how can you mean that?

1365
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:15,058
After what happened.

1366
01:13:15,091 --> 01:13:17,961
Look, whatever happened
between you and Pepper,

1367
01:13:17,994 --> 01:13:20,730
It doesn't change the fact that
you're great at what you do.

1368
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:25,435
And, uh, the truth is...

1369
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:29,439
I still want a chance
to make us work.

1370
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:37,080
I'm gonna leave
after the show tomorrow.

1371
01:13:38,615 --> 01:13:40,517
And I really hope you're
in the car with me.

1372
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:52,195
[Sandy: Recording]
No, you don't get your wife
sexy lingerie for Christmas.

1373
01:13:52,228 --> 01:13:54,531
[Pepper: Recording]
Why not? It's kind of
a his-and-hers gift.

1374
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:56,733
[Sandy]
Please. The last thing that I
want in the middle of winter

1375
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:58,502
Is fishnet underwear, okay?

1376
01:13:58,535 --> 01:14:01,571
I like my p.j.'s flannel
and preferably with feet.

1377
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:04,173
[Pepper]
Which explains why
you're still single.

1378
01:14:04,207 --> 01:14:06,776
[Laughing]
See? It's funny, right?

1379
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:09,178
Yeah, it is.

1380
01:14:09,212 --> 01:14:11,781
But it's about as soft
as a bag of marshmallows.

1381
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:16,252
You're wrong.
You're wrong, man.

1382
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,021
People love this stuff.

1383
01:14:18,054 --> 01:14:20,990
Yeah, maybe back in Weedpatch
or wherever you were.

1384
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:23,593
But this is L.A.
Nobody's gonna want
to hear that, man,

1385
01:14:23,627 --> 01:14:25,094
Especially not
coming out of you.

1386
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:28,031
How do you know?
Man, come on.
Give me an hour.

1387
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:31,134
Middle of the night.
I don't care.
I'll do it for free.

1388
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:33,803
And if it flops,
I'll let it go.
I promise.

1389
01:14:33,837 --> 01:14:36,540
Pepper, it's not you.
Huh?

1390
01:14:36,573 --> 01:14:38,908
You're all about edge.
Getting crazy.

1391
01:14:38,942 --> 01:14:40,677
Being unpredictable.
That's your brand.

1392
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:42,712
What if I want
a different brand.

1393
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:49,553
Then you will be walking away
from a ton of money...

1394
01:14:49,586 --> 01:14:51,755
And a very successful career.

1395
01:14:54,758 --> 01:14:57,661
[Sighs]
Look, my advice to you...

1396
01:14:57,694 --> 01:15:00,597
Is to just let her go, man.

1397
01:15:24,588 --> 01:15:26,823
- Hey.
- Hi.

1398
01:15:28,157 --> 01:15:30,827
You going somewhere?

1399
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,662
I haven't decided yet.

1400
01:15:32,696 --> 01:15:36,132
You know, Cole wants me
to go with him to Dallas.

1401
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:37,734
Wow.

1402
01:15:38,835 --> 01:15:40,770
What do you want to do?

1403
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:44,908
I want
what I can't have.

1404
01:15:44,941 --> 01:15:47,110
Honey.

1405
01:15:47,143 --> 01:15:50,814
I don't know.
Part of me thinks
I should just go.

1406
01:15:50,847 --> 01:15:53,549
You know, give myself
a chance to start over.

1407
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:58,755
And Cole? Is he someone
that you want to be with?

1408
01:15:58,788 --> 01:16:01,758
I don't know. I...
Maybe someday.

1409
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:04,828
Well, then maybe someday
you should go to Dallas.

1410
01:16:04,861 --> 01:16:08,331
- But not now.
- I can't stay here.

1411
01:16:08,364 --> 01:16:11,300
Every time I look
at that empty microphone,

1412
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:13,703
I think about Pepper.

1413
01:16:13,737 --> 01:16:16,572
I don't think I could
get through a show without
completely falling apart.

1414
01:16:20,644 --> 01:16:23,246
Yes, you can.

1415
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:25,248
It gets better.

1416
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:29,653
I can't tell you how much
I used to feel that same way...

1417
01:16:29,686 --> 01:16:32,989
Every time I'd be in bed...

1418
01:16:33,022 --> 01:16:36,159
And I'd look
at Dad's empty pillow.

1419
01:16:36,192 --> 01:16:37,794
Mom.

1420
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,665
But it does get better.

1421
01:16:44,734 --> 01:16:46,703
You do what you need to do.

1422
01:16:48,004 --> 01:16:49,372
I love you.

1423
01:16:50,874 --> 01:16:52,108
I love you too.

1424
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,909
Hey, Mr. Sterling.

1425
01:17:59,943 --> 01:18:01,845
Nice day, huh?

1426
01:18:03,112 --> 01:18:04,748
What's nice about it?

1427
01:18:04,781 --> 01:18:08,952
Well, my friends back east
are bragging about the snow
they got for the holidays.

1428
01:18:08,985 --> 01:18:12,922
I just think it's great
to be in California
at Christmas.

1429
01:18:12,956 --> 01:18:14,924
Depends on who you're with,
I guess.

1430
01:18:16,492 --> 01:18:19,395
Yeah. I, uh...
I know what you mean.

1431
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:22,331
You know, my grandparents
felt the same way.

1432
01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:26,736
They were, uh,
married for 43 years.

1433
01:18:27,937 --> 01:18:30,206
God bless 'em.

1434
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:34,043
Didn't matter where they were,
as long as they were together.

1435
01:18:34,077 --> 01:18:35,912
You know?
That was the, uh...

1436
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:39,348
That was the greatest place
on earth.

1437
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:43,920
Thanks, Jimmy.
I needed that.

1438
01:18:45,188 --> 01:18:46,722
Sure thing, sir.

1439
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:49,425
Hey, Jimmy.

1440
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:51,094
Something wrong, sir?

1441
01:18:51,127 --> 01:18:53,429
[Chuckles]
No.

1442
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:56,132
Something's right.

1443
01:18:56,165 --> 01:18:58,501
Something's very right.
You know what?

1444
01:18:58,534 --> 01:19:00,804
I'm gonna need to get
those keys from you.

1445
01:19:06,943 --> 01:19:08,444
I'll see you.

1446
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:10,313
Drive safe.

1447
01:19:38,474 --> 01:19:40,076
Here. Keep the change.

1448
01:19:52,455 --> 01:19:54,057
Hey, Kate. Is Sandy around?

1449
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:55,258
Pepper, what are you
doing here?

1450
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,260
I came to tell her
what an idiot I am.

1451
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:59,028
Couldn't you have done that
on the phone?

1452
01:19:59,062 --> 01:20:01,097
No, I've realized it
and I need to show her.

1453
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,599
- Is she upstairs?
- No, she's at work.

1454
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,368
But her show is
in the morning.

1455
01:20:05,401 --> 01:20:07,170
No, it's
a special broadcast today.

1456
01:20:07,203 --> 01:20:09,038
She's saying good-bye.

1457
01:20:09,072 --> 01:20:10,874
Good-bye?
What are you talking about?

1458
01:20:10,907 --> 01:20:13,076
To her listeners.
Didn't she call you?

1459
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:14,610
No.

1460
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:18,481
She's going to Dallas with Cole.

1461
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:24,587
No.
No, she can't do that.

1462
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:26,322
I gotta go.
I gotta go.

1463
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:29,192
Thank you, Kate.
Thank you.

1464
01:20:33,629 --> 01:20:35,865
Hey, come back! Wait!

1465
01:20:44,908 --> 01:20:46,242
I'm gonna need to borrow
that car of yours.

1466
01:20:46,275 --> 01:20:49,012
Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

1467
01:20:49,045 --> 01:20:50,446
Hey, do you know
how to drive a stick?

1468
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:52,115
Of course.

1469
01:20:52,148 --> 01:20:55,885
-[Engine Revving]
-[Pepper]
Come on. Stupid truck.

1470
01:20:55,919 --> 01:20:59,622
Come on, let's go.
[Grunts]

1471
01:20:59,655 --> 01:21:01,490
Come on!

1472
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,528
[Woman Caller]
He's obsessed with sports.

1473
01:21:05,561 --> 01:21:08,031
He says he'll do better
right after bowl season,

1474
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:09,598
Or the NFL play-offs.

1475
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:12,969
For sure
before spring training.

1476
01:21:13,002 --> 01:21:15,471
- What do you think?
Should I believe him?
-[Pops]

1477
01:21:15,504 --> 01:21:19,575
Unfortunately it sounds like
you're in a relationship
with someone...

1478
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:22,645
Who doesn't want
the same things as you.

1479
01:21:22,678 --> 01:21:25,982
So, you have a choice to make.

1480
01:21:26,015 --> 01:21:29,352
You either spend
the rest of your life
wishing it were different,

1481
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:32,555
Or... you move on.

1482
01:21:32,588 --> 01:21:35,591
Um, let's take our final break.

1483
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:39,362
You're listening to a special
farewell broadcast of Dr. Love.

1484
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:42,898
[Pops]

1485
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:09,092
Aww, man.

1486
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:10,526
[Honks]

1487
01:22:10,559 --> 01:22:13,362
Move! Come on!

1488
01:22:13,396 --> 01:22:15,999
- Watch where you're going!
- All right, already!

1489
01:22:16,032 --> 01:22:17,433
- Go!
- Kill yourself!

1490
01:22:25,308 --> 01:22:27,243
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1491
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:39,655
[Sandy Laughing]
Okay.

1492
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:43,092
- One more.
- Yeah.

1493
01:22:46,362 --> 01:22:47,997
[Sighs]

1494
01:22:50,599 --> 01:22:52,635
[Grunting,
Panting]

1495
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:01,444
[Groans]

1496
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:02,711
Pepper?

1497
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:07,383
Pepper!

1498
01:23:10,219 --> 01:23:14,290
Oh. Oh, man.
Oh, I am so glad
to have you back.

1499
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:16,059
It's like a morgue in there.

1500
01:23:16,092 --> 01:23:18,327
I'm starting to play funeral
music between the breaks.

1501
01:23:18,361 --> 01:23:21,397
Yeah, well, let it go.
I'm not coming back.

1502
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:23,766
Well...
[Chuckles]

1503
01:23:23,799 --> 01:23:25,701
What do you mean
you're not coming back?

1504
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:28,271
You belong here, man.
Come on.

1505
01:23:28,304 --> 01:23:30,673
Now get down out of that thing
and do something totally epic.

1506
01:23:30,706 --> 01:23:34,377
Give it up, Jonah.
Okay?

1507
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:35,744
Go find another hero.

1508
01:23:38,081 --> 01:23:40,583
I don't even give a damn about
the radio show anymore, man.

1509
01:23:40,616 --> 01:23:42,651
I'm not what you think I am.

1510
01:23:43,786 --> 01:23:46,255
I'm just another guy.

1511
01:23:49,392 --> 01:23:52,695
Who said anything
about the radio show?

1512
01:23:52,728 --> 01:23:55,831
I'm talking about Sandy.

1513
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:57,800
She loves you, dude.

1514
01:23:57,833 --> 01:24:01,404
I mean, even a nimrod
like me can see that.

1515
01:24:04,207 --> 01:24:07,276
You know what? Maybe, uh...
Maybe you're right.

1516
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:10,479
Maybe you're
just another guy.

1517
01:24:10,513 --> 01:24:12,415
And she deserves a lot
better than that.

1518
01:24:32,668 --> 01:24:36,172
[Sandy]
Okay. That'll wrap things up
for me today.

1519
01:24:36,205 --> 01:24:38,707
On a personal note, I...

1520
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:42,311
I just want to tell you all
how special you've made me feel.

1521
01:24:42,345 --> 01:24:46,115
And how grateful I am that
you've let me into your lives.

1522
01:24:46,149 --> 01:24:50,519
So... from the bottom
of my heart, thank you.

1523
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:01,830
[Phone Rings]

1524
01:25:03,566 --> 01:25:06,735
Dr. Love. Uh, you are caller
number too late.

1525
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:10,506
She just hung up on
her last victim. So...

1526
01:25:10,539 --> 01:25:13,809
- This is Dr. Sandra Love
and you've been listening to...
- Uh, hold the phone, Doc.

1527
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:16,579
What?

1528
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:19,582
Uh, it looks like we have
just one more caller...

1529
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:22,385
Who could really use
a little help.

1530
01:25:29,658 --> 01:25:33,162
Uh, okay.
So, um, yeah.

1531
01:25:33,196 --> 01:25:35,498
I guess we have time
for one more quick call.

1532
01:25:35,531 --> 01:25:37,866
Who am I speaking with?

1533
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:43,806
An overpaid, rock-headed,
Cro-Magnon twit...

1534
01:25:43,839 --> 01:25:47,710
Who'd rather die than let
the love of his life slip away.

1535
01:25:47,743 --> 01:25:50,513
He finally understands
what's missing in his life.

1536
01:25:50,546 --> 01:25:53,916
And even though it may seem
like he has it all,

1537
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:00,256
He realizes that he's got
nothing without her.

1538
01:26:04,927 --> 01:26:08,597
Uh, I-I can definitely hear...

1539
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:11,367
The regret in your voice,

1540
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:16,171
But I think you might have
waited too long.

1541
01:26:19,975 --> 01:26:22,177
Not if she gives me
another chance.

1542
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:28,617
I just don't know
if that's possible.

1543
01:26:28,651 --> 01:26:31,887
- Good-bye, caller.
- Wait. Can I just say
one more thing?

1544
01:26:33,756 --> 01:26:36,625
What else is there to say?

1545
01:26:36,659 --> 01:26:39,295
[Sighs]

1546
01:26:39,328 --> 01:26:40,996
I don't think I can express it
over the phone.

1547
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:43,766
Maybe you should come outside
and see for yourself.

1548
01:26:45,601 --> 01:26:47,336
You're here?

1549
01:26:50,806 --> 01:26:54,277
This is crazy.
I can't just walk out
on my listeners like that.

1550
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:56,612
I don't think you have
to worry about that.

1551
01:26:56,645 --> 01:26:58,714
'Cause they're all out here
with me.

1552
01:27:20,836 --> 01:27:22,838
All right,
this is it.

1553
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:25,641
Now.

1554
01:28:02,745 --> 01:28:04,880
[Cheering, Clapping]

1555
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:30,072
- Look, it's snowing.
- Oh. [Laughing]

1556
01:28:39,515 --> 01:28:41,450
[Both Laughing]
