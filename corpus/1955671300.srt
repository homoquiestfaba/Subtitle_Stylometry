1
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,700
Good Morning.
- Good morning teacher.

2
00:00:45,673 --> 00:00:47,233
Bushido.

3
00:00:48,217 --> 00:00:50,337
The Path of the Samurai.

4
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:55,834
His honor was the
guide of their lives.

5
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:58,146
A Samurai knew...

6
00:00:58,978 --> 00:01:05,898
that his final test
related to death.

7
00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:13,047
Face to face with death...

8
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:16,851
intrepid and unwavering...

9
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:20,865
who does not seek death...

10
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:26,436
but the acceptance...

11
00:01:34,722 --> 00:01:36,762
was carrying...

12
00:01:37,808 --> 00:01:40,688
samurai life.

13
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:53,529
Nice, man.

14
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:58,339
Stuart?

15
00:01:59,124 --> 00:02:00,924
He is Professor Vent.

16
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,610
It's so beautiful here.
And everyone is so cool.

17
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:22,638
Brazilians are cool people.
When's your speech?

18
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:28,822
Ten hours. Then I visit the children's
hospital in Rio de Janeiro.

19
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,350
Secret Service.
This is invasion.

20
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:43,777
Hey, no one can be here.

21
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,300
Like the mother?

22
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,279
Well, they still Room
Lincoln reorganization.

23
00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:05,286
Why did she never go?

24
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:07,726
They wanted a married doctor.

25
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:15,181
You can not be here.

26
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:17,178
I do not speak English...

27
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:32,961
In position. Let's go further.

28
00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:37,785
To the beach?

29
00:03:38,056 --> 00:03:41,576
Honey, do you know
what beach wear is?

30
00:03:44,397 --> 00:03:46,357
I love you too.

31
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,180
What is?

32
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:10,121
I'll be right there.

33
00:04:12,425 --> 00:04:15,785
Terrorists are called
People's Liberation.

34
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:18,097
They demand a hundred million dollars...

35
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:22,711
and modern weapons the
government subversive activity.

36
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:25,149
I do not care what they demand.

37
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:27,359
They already have six people murdered...

38
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,010
This government does not
deal with terrorists.

39
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:34,163
But... have your wife...

40
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:41,465
I'm aware of that. Thank you.

41
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,902
- When?
- Yeah.

42
00:06:36,489 --> 00:06:40,689
I hope your husband understands...

43
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:46,936
that we are prepared
to die for our sake.

44
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:50,507
How very tragic.

45
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:55,497
But if you think you and my husband
your gang gear weapons will do...

46
00:06:55,923 --> 00:06:58,363
forget it.

47
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:05,609
If not, get it.

48
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:19,306
About five minutes to
the destination, sir.

49
00:07:42,555 --> 00:07:43,995
Good luck.

50
00:09:39,968 --> 00:09:41,528
Check the terrace!

51
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:52,927
If I hear any more
shot, you're dead.

52
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:29,096
- Who are you?
- Room service.

53
00:10:48,621 --> 00:10:52,501
I do not know who you are, but you
did not even introduce yourself.

54
00:10:53,876 --> 00:10:55,916
Oh my God... You're hurt!

55
00:10:56,212 --> 00:10:58,892
Can you swim, my lady?
- Yes, why?

56
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:04,261
What are you doing?

57
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,095
Put your arms around my neck.

58
00:11:14,188 --> 00:11:17,148
Are not we going down there?

59
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,464
It's just an attraction in Disneyland.
- Promise?

60
00:11:21,863 --> 00:11:24,743
Hug me around the
neck and hold tight.

61
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:27,744
Is your husband very jealous?

62
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,000
Nice to meet you, Mrs.

63
00:12:46,658 --> 00:12:48,458
Thank you

64
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,900
The man who saved me, Who is he?

65
00:12:55,334 --> 00:12:57,534
Ma'am, we have no idea.

66
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:49,143
Where are you going?

67
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:51,463
Visit the George.

68
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:54,126
- Can I come, too?
- Not this time.

69
00:13:55,186 --> 00:13:59,026
- Are you okay?
- Yes. See you soon.

70
00:14:35,353 --> 00:14:38,793
Hello Nevada.
How you doing, boy?

71
00:14:43,026 --> 00:14:46,146
- What a surprise!
- Hello Joshua.

72
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:49,369
- How you doing, George?
- Happy to see you.

73
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:52,381
"You've had a job here."
"We've been painting, that's all.

74
00:14:52,704 --> 00:14:54,824
Come in for coffee.

75
00:14:57,042 --> 00:15:00,322
I've heard about the case
with the First Lady.

76
00:15:00,878 --> 00:15:04,798
It reminds me of the time
I started in Burma and...

77
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:11,419
Listen, I know you're not in
order to retrieve memories.

78
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:14,674
But tell me. What's up?

79
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:19,322
How did you know
the time, George?

80
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:26,021
It's a feeling inside,
you know that.

81
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:28,205
Is it your time?

82
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,670
I think so.

83
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:37,477
Then you will see a
successor to find.

84
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,200
Just as I was you.

85
00:15:52,056 --> 00:15:53,376
Hear!

86
00:15:53,683 --> 00:15:57,443
According to sources here and the U.S.
the Santiago responsible cartel...

87
00:15:57,813 --> 00:16:01,693
about 40 percent of illicit
drugs enter the U.S.

88
00:16:02,065 --> 00:16:04,105
- Excuse me, sir?
- Sergeant?

89
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:07,005
We have nothing against
action, but as we know...

90
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:11,321
why throw things other than
just flat from the air?

91
00:16:11,701 --> 00:16:14,461
The cartel has a primary
school in the complex.

92
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:16,788
A school?

93
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:19,803
There is a teacher and
about twenty students.

94
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:23,086
What? Cum...
- Your mission is complex...

95
00:16:23,463 --> 00:16:26,663
destruction and an acceptable number
of civilian losses to maintain.

96
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:29,127
An acceptable civilian
number to lose?

97
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:32,147
Lieutenant, can you
explain what this is?

98
00:16:32,473 --> 00:16:34,753
Five children? Six?
- That's enough, Sergeant!

99
00:16:35,558 --> 00:16:39,998
But you remember that your main
neutralization of the installation.

100
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,048
Apple.

101
00:17:10,302 --> 00:17:12,022
One red apple.

102
00:17:14,807 --> 00:17:16,767
Red apple.

103
00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:22,642
Two red apples.

104
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:26,646
Very good.

105
00:17:45,086 --> 00:17:46,686
For the love of God.

106
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:49,564
You had to believe God thank
you for insulting me.

107
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:53,245
- No sir...
- Not Santiago...

108
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:06,728
Should I kill him?
"No, I have more balls."

109
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:24,423
The helicopter will be exactly
in an hour ago. One hour!

110
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:27,394
I'll wait with you.
- Okay, she's done!

111
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:38,465
Forward!

112
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,810
You're ready to go.
- OK, let's go.

113
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:14,929
It's about three clicks
from here to the place.

114
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:17,105
That gives us fifteen
minutes to the floor...

115
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:20,313
thirty minutes to the mission
and fifteen to return.

116
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:22,042
More questions?

117
00:19:22,312 --> 00:19:24,992
I have a question.
Will you marry me?

118
00:19:27,318 --> 00:19:30,278
Unfortunately, Burroughs, I
Dobson has already promised.

119
00:19:30,654 --> 00:19:34,814
Well. Now, remember...
Together, together at home.

120
00:19:35,617 --> 00:19:36,977
Stressed, men!

121
00:20:26,504 --> 00:20:28,064
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

122
00:20:28,339 --> 00:20:30,219
Listen, I want you kids
away from the situation.

123
00:20:30,383 --> 00:20:33,583
What are you going to do?
- Take the children to safety.

124
00:21:40,997 --> 00:21:42,677
Am I releasing you?

125
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:50,016
I suppose so.

126
00:22:08,148 --> 00:22:10,108
- Ready to go?
- Yes, let's start.

127
00:22:22,872 --> 00:22:24,832
Come on, blow it up!

128
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,224
Do it!

129
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:45,046
Let's hit it!

130
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:03,452
Where are Burroughs and Dobson?
"They were behind us.

131
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:06,669
What is?
"There are two men behind."

132
00:23:26,396 --> 00:23:28,276
Let's go.

133
00:23:51,545 --> 00:23:54,825
I can not wait any longer.
I have an enemy troop report.

134
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:57,096
No, we stay!

135
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:01,183
- Climb!
- No, he does not have.

136
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:06,332
I gave you an order, soldier!

137
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:14,997
I sleep like this in court.
"Then give me enough reason."

138
00:24:17,196 --> 00:24:18,996
Look, Sergeant! There they are!

139
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,145
Cover me!

140
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,350
Come back, Slater!

141
00:24:36,718 --> 00:24:38,438
He's seriously injured, Sergeant.

142
00:24:53,816 --> 00:24:55,856
Hold on, my friend. It's good.

143
00:25:03,953 --> 00:25:06,953
The lieutenant has to see
I also saw some actions.

144
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:23,245
We understand the circumstances
surrounding the incident...

145
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:27,683
and our concern to slater
his men to imagine.

146
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,500
The truth is that a
direct command denied it.

147
00:25:31,856 --> 00:25:34,496
And you have a more mobilized
employee mobilization.

148
00:25:34,818 --> 00:25:38,098
Thus, this court has no
choice but to convict...

149
00:25:38,486 --> 00:25:41,366
at least seven years
in a federal facility.

150
00:26:00,262 --> 00:26:02,222
Good shot, Slater.

151
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,060
There he is.

152
00:26:23,743 --> 00:26:27,023
Do you have a cigarette?
"No, sorry, I do not smoke."

153
00:26:27,372 --> 00:26:29,332
Me neither.

154
00:26:30,292 --> 00:26:32,892
- Get Slater.
- I thought not.

155
00:26:33,252 --> 00:26:34,812
This hole is not.

156
00:26:35,337 --> 00:26:36,777
From now on.

157
00:26:38,382 --> 00:26:41,822
Nice. If you're with him the
grave will be, you can.

158
00:26:49,101 --> 00:26:50,661
Everything is OK?

159
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:56,947
Ask them.

160
00:26:59,613 --> 00:27:02,533
It's going too far, Slater.
There is no turning back.

161
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:11,606
On the side.

162
00:27:30,602 --> 00:27:32,962
Smith, Lundgren. Opzouten.

163
00:27:39,945 --> 00:27:43,385
Let me see how hard you are without
your "brother" to support you.

164
00:27:44,115 --> 00:27:46,995
Seriously, this is you.
"Not the one?"

165
00:28:20,988 --> 00:28:23,588
He put it down!

166
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:25,809
Guard!

167
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:37,521
He is dead.

168
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:40,244
Come on.

169
00:28:45,262 --> 00:28:49,262
We're just talking and
he's suddenly turned on.

170
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:51,441
Next witness.

171
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,610
I just got there in time.

172
00:28:58,275 --> 00:29:02,475
He is the Special Unit.
These guys are murderers.

173
00:29:04,824 --> 00:29:06,784
We may be satisfied that
we are still alive.

174
00:29:12,122 --> 00:29:13,762
The witness must remain.

175
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,960
Not less than thirty years.

176
00:29:36,271 --> 00:29:38,991
I have twelve possible
successors for you.

177
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,600
From this, it is the
most promising.

178
00:29:46,116 --> 00:29:47,796
Deke Slater.

179
00:29:51,996 --> 00:29:52,996
Is he in prison?

180
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,319
Yes, but I have the
charges you studied.

181
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:58,347
I find it mistakenly hard rated.

182
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:02,750
He was popular with almost every
major university in the country.

183
00:30:03,132 --> 00:30:06,332
And he had an athletic
or purse to get.

184
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,640
And he was on duty? Fascinating.

185
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,177
Okay. Let him try.

186
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,965
Who are you?
- I'm your ticket to freedom.

187
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,023
Open B-409.

188
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,803
What do you mean:
Can not you tell me?

189
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,480
What do not you understand, Mr.
Slater?

190
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,070
Hang on. Wait!

191
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:20,914
First you take me out of
prison, even autonomous...

192
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:23,655
which is not only something,
but a bit insulting...

193
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,967
You brought me here tells me that I or
another mysterious man satisfy ga...

194
00:31:26,991 --> 00:31:29,403
and now you say you can
not give me more details.

195
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:31,522
It's perfectly understandable.

196
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:43,201
This is him? A teacher?

197
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,097
A teacher.

198
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:49,002
Is this the man I'm
going to explain?

199
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:58,834
Who are you?

200
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:03,057
Tell me, I had enough
as a toy to be used.

201
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:05,501
I have doubts and
want answers now.

202
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:09,156
I told you, I...

203
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:21,807
What do you know?

204
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:28,618
The right hand of the president?

205
00:32:29,033 --> 00:32:32,073
The function is created at
the time of Abraham Lincoln.

206
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:35,651
Since then, every president
he can trust someone...

207
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:37,958
what will happen to.

208
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,375
Oh, whatever? I get it.

209
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:43,992
Well, within the limits
of reason and morality.

210
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:49,113
The function is highly confidential.
It exists, but it is little known.

211
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:54,757
You mean the White House
maintains complete denial?

212
00:32:57,729 --> 00:33:01,889
So now you're the man... Are you on
the right side of the President?

213
00:33:02,651 --> 00:33:05,571
What is?
Would you like to retire, or something?

214
00:33:06,237 --> 00:33:08,037
Something.

215
00:33:09,991 --> 00:33:12,751
How do you know I'm
the right man to do?

216
00:33:13,077 --> 00:33:14,557
I do not know.

217
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:18,482
Not yet.

218
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,090
Jesus... What is this space?
- Our training room.

219
00:33:40,481 --> 00:33:42,521
We have everything we need.

220
00:33:42,983 --> 00:33:45,663
Including my
favorite, "the way".

221
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,584
Or, as I call it, "the curse".

222
00:33:55,913 --> 00:33:59,593
When will we start?
"I'm glad to see you so enthusiastic."

223
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:02,283
Let's see how long that lasts.

224
00:34:05,632 --> 00:34:08,912
Is she always so sarcastic?
"This is nothing."

225
00:34:32,951 --> 00:34:37,151
This is very beautiful,
but we do it here.

226
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:41,406
What do you mean by that?
"Come, let me see you."

227
00:34:45,296 --> 00:34:47,976
- You got it?
- Yes I understand.

228
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,510
If we do it here.

229
00:36:12,762 --> 00:36:14,722
We will try again.

230
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,620
General Tran... Welcome.

231
00:36:37,076 --> 00:36:39,516
Thank you, Mr. Santiago.

232
00:36:43,794 --> 00:36:46,754
Satisfaction is for us.
- What about plutonium?

233
00:36:51,758 --> 00:36:53,478
Thank you

234
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,978
It's my pleasure.

235
00:37:04,437 --> 00:37:05,957
You did not have broccoli.

236
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,411
I really do not like broccoli.

237
00:37:09,818 --> 00:37:13,258
I do not care. You eat broccoli.

238
00:37:17,826 --> 00:37:20,386
George Bush does not eat broccoli.

239
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:23,733
But you're not George Bush.

240
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:31,062
What does he like?
"Who, George Bush?"

241
00:37:31,509 --> 00:37:34,789
No, President Mathews.
He is a good boy?

242
00:37:35,178 --> 00:37:37,618
I do not know. I never knew him.

243
00:37:38,974 --> 00:37:41,254
I serve as an intermediary
for the president.

244
00:37:41,684 --> 00:37:43,964
If something goes wrong on a mission...

245
00:37:44,271 --> 00:37:47,711
it is so impossible to go
back to the White House.

246
00:37:48,691 --> 00:37:50,451
Just eat your broccoli.

247
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:54,082
You see, you're not
the one to choose it.

248
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:09,094
In an ideal situation, a
well-trained superiority fighter...

249
00:38:09,464 --> 00:38:11,184
on the less-trained opponent.

250
00:38:11,507 --> 00:38:13,707
But what less an
ideal situation?

251
00:38:14,052 --> 00:38:18,652
You are tired, hungry, you are
mentally and physically exhausted.

252
00:38:19,056 --> 00:38:20,056
And then?

253
00:38:21,392 --> 00:38:25,152
You have the ability to develop attention
and concentration to maintain.

254
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:28,707
For every other head to
eradicate the journey.

255
00:38:29,024 --> 00:38:32,384
Your physical condition,
your mental condition...

256
00:38:32,986 --> 00:38:36,106
Your concern for your
safety or even your life.

257
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,370
There is nothing
more than Mission.

258
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:47,384
This is something that the great
inventors in the computer industry...

259
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:48,666
invented especially for us.

260
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:51,239
It gives access to the
universal satellite.

261
00:38:51,549 --> 00:38:55,389
You can communicate directly with
me through a secret technology.

262
00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:00,090
And access to top secret files
from the BVD and the FBI.

263
00:39:00,473 --> 00:39:04,553
More questions?
- An. Has no patience?

264
00:39:05,104 --> 00:39:08,624
Listen carefully. This
phone has a global reach.

265
00:39:08,982 --> 00:39:11,942
It is also a radio
controlled ignition system.

266
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:15,399
You run an access number,
and then your code.

267
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:27,421
Energy is supplied by a
small nuclear battery.

268
00:39:29,481 --> 00:39:30,481
What is it?

269
00:39:30,505 --> 00:39:35,265
This is full of C-7s. This is the
C-4 similar to a stink bomblet.

270
00:39:39,764 --> 00:39:42,124
Hear 's, this is stupid.
- What's stupid?

271
00:39:42,475 --> 00:39:46,795
This one. A practice with that battle.
Sorry but...

272
00:39:50,817 --> 00:39:53,537
Rule one:
Never underestimate your opponent.

273
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:56,821
Come on, Joshua. She told me
but a step forward, okay?

274
00:39:59,492 --> 00:40:02,372
Rule number one...
- Well, I barrel 'm.

275
00:40:43,455 --> 00:40:46,575
If you see this guy... Shoot.

276
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:56,859
In a fraction of a second...

277
00:40:57,177 --> 00:40:59,617
can decide the average difference
between life and death.

278
00:41:07,603 --> 00:41:10,283
You have to relax and
use your momentum.

279
00:41:21,828 --> 00:41:25,788
The secret is commitment.
You absolutely should go for it.

280
00:41:27,373 --> 00:41:30,053
Try again.
- Yeah, just give it a try.

281
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,220
How do you know Joshua?

282
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:47,215
In fact, I've known
my whole life already

283
00:41:54,527 --> 00:41:56,967
In your file it was just
that you are an orphan.

284
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,440
What happened to your family?

285
00:42:01,158 --> 00:42:02,638
I do not know.

286
00:42:06,664 --> 00:42:08,224
When I had three...

287
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:12,203
my parents me a church left.

288
00:42:12,544 --> 00:42:16,064
No note. Without explanation.
Anything.

289
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,580
If you want, I can
probably find you.

290
00:42:22,472 --> 00:42:24,432
Maybe later.

291
00:42:25,182 --> 00:42:28,062
How about you?
Where's your family?

292
00:42:28,394 --> 00:42:30,034
Joshua is my family.

293
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,074
Do not. I mean your real family.

294
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:35,638
Joshua is my real family.
He is my father.

295
00:42:38,737 --> 00:42:41,537
He met my mother at
the end of the war.

296
00:42:41,867 --> 00:42:46,067
They were in love and getting married.
I followed not much later.

297
00:42:46,455 --> 00:42:48,575
What happened to the
mother happened?

298
00:42:49,748 --> 00:42:51,548
She was murdered.

299
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:56,470
They were deceived by a man
they thought was his friend.

300
00:43:11,605 --> 00:43:13,045
Checkmate.

301
00:43:15,984 --> 00:43:18,264
I really hate this stupid game.

302
00:43:20,072 --> 00:43:23,512
This is only possible
because you are very bad.

303
00:43:35,503 --> 00:43:37,383
I already am.

304
00:43:52,813 --> 00:43:55,093
I would like your insurance.

305
00:43:57,569 --> 00:44:00,769
It must be assured,
Mr President.

306
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:06,628
Donna? I am ready for the
instructions on Indonesia.

307
00:44:07,538 --> 00:44:09,258
Her name is Courtney Lyons.

308
00:44:09,622 --> 00:44:12,902
The daughter of Senator Bob Lyons?
- The only.

309
00:44:13,503 --> 00:44:16,303
Three months ago she was
persuaded to join...

310
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,510
a religious sect adhere.

311
00:44:18,798 --> 00:44:22,478
Three days ago, they got word
to their father of contraband.

312
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:26,621
She wants out.
"But they will leave you."

313
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:31,339
Wait, the daughter of a Senator
is arrested against her will...

314
00:44:31,729 --> 00:44:33,689
and you do not just send Marines?

315
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:37,579
Says "Branch Davidian Composed"
one thing?

316
00:44:38,486 --> 00:44:39,486
I get it.

317
00:44:39,529 --> 00:44:41,409
The sect is called "The Chosen One".

318
00:44:41,698 --> 00:44:45,218
Your leader is a pipsqueak.
Douglas Wetherby.

319
00:44:45,575 --> 00:44:48,535
Washington has the right
to We try to explain?

320
00:44:49,163 --> 00:44:52,843
What right has the "politicians"
contribute to our requirements.

321
00:44:53,378 --> 00:44:57,578
The wolf may be at the
door, we will not let him.

322
00:44:57,962 --> 00:45:01,562
We are a sovereign power,
an unsurpassed nation.

323
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:06,967
And we will fight to the death
for our right to freedom.

324
00:45:08,558 --> 00:45:10,678
Do you like him very much?

325
00:45:26,284 --> 00:45:28,644
I have a question...

326
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,760
The people you keep
outside or inside?

327
00:45:32,082 --> 00:45:33,282
Both, probably.

328
00:45:39,257 --> 00:45:40,257
There she is.

329
00:45:41,257 --> 00:45:42,457
Job?

330
00:45:42,718 --> 00:45:46,598
The sediment containing a small Creator
from a range of radioactive isotopes.

331
00:45:46,972 --> 00:45:48,532
They think... is to put a

332
00:45:48,807 --> 00:45:52,007
but they must ensure that the
isotope that follows its 24 hours

333
00:46:06,033 --> 00:46:08,393
We'll wait until dark,
so let's go inside.

334
00:46:09,203 --> 00:46:11,883
We?
I think I should do it themselves.

335
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:14,819
Because?
- Because this mission is a breeze.

336
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:18,405
I go in there, take her out and I back
before someone announces that they are gone.

337
00:46:18,429 --> 00:46:21,062
No mission is a breeze.
And I do not know if you're ready.

338
00:46:21,381 --> 00:46:23,661
There is only one way to
make it discover, right?

339
00:46:26,137 --> 00:46:28,657
There are patrol guards
along the grounds.

340
00:46:29,224 --> 00:46:31,984
So you came here more.

341
00:46:33,686 --> 00:46:36,366
I have never had such clear
recognition images seen.

342
00:46:36,732 --> 00:46:39,492
We download them directly
from the satellite.

343
00:46:39,818 --> 00:46:42,898
What is the satellite?
- Eye in the sky.

344
00:46:43,237 --> 00:46:45,837
There are probably no more than a
few centimeters in the earth...

345
00:46:46,157 --> 00:46:49,197
not continuously being photographed.

346
00:47:01,382 --> 00:47:05,982
The microphone is completely wireless.
Chatting is normal. Give me your arm.

347
00:47:06,553 --> 00:47:09,513
Because? What is it?
- Radioactive isotope.

348
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:15,179
The red dot is Courtney Lyons.
Blue is you.

349
00:47:18,857 --> 00:47:23,057
Remember, it's a simple extraction.
You're going back in and out.

350
00:47:28,577 --> 00:47:31,017
But Mr. Wetherby, the domestic
bill against terrorism...

351
00:47:31,369 --> 00:47:32,969
the following week
Congress for approval.

352
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,040
If it is we can pack.

353
00:47:35,916 --> 00:47:39,276
Who supports the project?
- Senator Lyons.

354
00:47:39,921 --> 00:47:41,721
Get Courtney Lyons.

355
00:47:42,048 --> 00:47:45,488
It's Senator Lyons time
to send a message.

356
00:48:36,062 --> 00:48:39,062
Come on, Mr. Wetherby
wants to talk to you.

357
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:52,529
Who are you?
- I get everything here.

358
00:48:53,204 --> 00:48:55,564
- Not without Cathy.
- Come on.

359
00:48:55,915 --> 00:48:58,515
No! I'm not going without her.

360
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:02,602
She is my best friend.
I can not go out.

361
00:49:07,009 --> 00:49:09,289
- Right. Where is she?
- On here.

362
00:49:17,769 --> 00:49:21,129
Cathy, come on. We go here.
- I stay here.

363
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:24,781
Who are you?

364
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:27,155
Wetherby is disturbed.

365
00:49:27,448 --> 00:49:29,728
We have to go.
With or without it.

366
00:49:32,577 --> 00:49:35,857
I'm not leaving.
"I'm not going without her."

367
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:53,580
Freeze.

368
00:49:55,017 --> 00:49:58,377
I do not know who you are, but
you're just a big mistake.

369
00:50:10,866 --> 00:50:12,986
- Who sent you?
- No one.

370
00:50:13,746 --> 00:50:15,866
I am a friend of these
girls, and I have them.

371
00:50:16,163 --> 00:50:18,363
You have one with
you, and where to go.

372
00:51:08,884 --> 00:51:11,324
What were you doing?
"She did not want to leave without her."

373
00:51:11,638 --> 00:51:15,238
- You had a job.
- I know, Joshua.

374
00:51:16,891 --> 00:51:20,491
Excuse.
"I have here on this subject."

375
00:51:28,487 --> 00:51:30,687
You need to talk to him.

376
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:34,599
He is not the easiest to speak.

377
00:51:34,994 --> 00:51:36,634
Talk to him.

378
00:51:52,053 --> 00:51:55,413
You'll think I screwed up.
- It's not not to ruin what you have...

379
00:51:55,807 --> 00:51:58,247
I know you have to ruin it.

380
00:51:59,687 --> 00:52:02,727
I followed my instinct.
"And that's the problem."

381
00:52:03,106 --> 00:52:05,946
It follows that you alone
are your instinct.

382
00:52:06,485 --> 00:52:09,365
Like when you hit the lieutenant.
"I had two men in the field."

383
00:52:09,738 --> 00:52:12,818
And it's not right.
But you had other options.

384
00:52:13,158 --> 00:52:17,678
What options do I have? Tell me.
- Think about it.

385
00:52:19,706 --> 00:52:22,986
And what did you get out of
this dead prisional guy?

386
00:52:23,585 --> 00:52:27,865
That was self-defense.
Time followed his instinct for survival.

387
00:52:32,428 --> 00:52:33,988
What would you say?

388
00:52:34,263 --> 00:52:37,863
I wanted to say that you were to other
things can listen to your instincts.

389
00:52:39,768 --> 00:52:41,328
As your mind.

390
00:52:41,729 --> 00:52:44,409
Well, maybe I am
just is not enough.

391
00:52:46,401 --> 00:52:48,281
Maybe not, no.

392
00:53:16,264 --> 00:53:20,424
Deke feels awful.
- Good. He led a mission in distress.

393
00:53:21,644 --> 00:53:22,684
What do you do?

394
00:53:27,483 --> 00:53:29,603
I know yet.

395
00:53:40,914 --> 00:53:43,434
Get ready for winter
or do the exercise?

396
00:53:43,751 --> 00:53:46,351
A little of both.

397
00:53:48,007 --> 00:53:50,127
What is wrong?

398
00:53:52,425 --> 00:53:54,705
I get the wrong
selected, George.

399
00:53:55,053 --> 00:53:56,093
Why do you think?

400
00:53:56,389 --> 00:53:59,269
He is so arrogant and
do everything to know.

401
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:03,309
And you do not think it
was you when you started?

402
00:54:04,664 --> 00:54:05,664
Maybe a little.

403
00:54:05,688 --> 00:54:08,448
Maybe a lot.
But you have already learned.

404
00:54:08,776 --> 00:54:10,576
You have two things
to look into.

405
00:54:10,862 --> 00:54:12,902
When I told you successor
to be found...

406
00:54:13,198 --> 00:54:15,318
I mean you should
create your own.

407
00:54:15,658 --> 00:54:17,658
You're not looking at the
negative side of a man...

408
00:54:17,702 --> 00:54:19,222
you are looking at your positive side.

409
00:54:19,953 --> 00:54:23,793
Secondly, because things do
not like what you would do...

410
00:54:24,167 --> 00:54:26,447
This does not mean it's wrong.

411
00:54:41,601 --> 00:54:42,601
How was your visit?

412
00:54:42,769 --> 00:54:46,449
Was good. Deke, we need to talk.

413
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:51,540
I'm in my office. No.
It affects all of us.

414
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:53,922
You screwed up.

415
00:54:53,946 --> 00:54:56,706
- I know but...
- Let me finish.

416
00:54:57,785 --> 00:55:00,745
You screwed up, but you did
it for the right reasons.

417
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:05,400
You will make mistakes, but what matters
is how you deal with those mistakes.

418
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:09,170
So I'm not fired?

419
00:55:11,173 --> 00:55:12,213
So you're not very lucky.

420
00:55:20,015 --> 00:55:23,535
Americans call it
a war on drugs...

421
00:55:23,895 --> 00:55:26,175
but it's a war against us.

422
00:55:26,565 --> 00:55:29,125
They have our
location destroyed...

423
00:55:29,901 --> 00:55:31,701
but never found.

424
00:55:32,987 --> 00:55:35,947
Americans think we can
fight impunity...

425
00:55:36,323 --> 00:55:39,683
that nothing we can do back.

426
00:55:40,078 --> 00:55:43,358
General Tran thanks you
and your plutonium...

427
00:55:44,082 --> 00:55:46,442
they will quickly realize
how deceived they are.

428
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:47,808
Two rotating giants and
a somersault backwards.

429
00:56:48,148 --> 00:56:49,148
I just did it.

430
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:52,118
I know. But now
you've got blindfold.

431
00:56:55,197 --> 00:56:56,557
He makes a joke, right?

432
00:57:01,077 --> 00:57:02,717
What do you think?

433
00:57:51,045 --> 00:57:52,445
I mean, let's go.

434
00:57:53,799 --> 00:57:55,519
He's better already.

435
00:57:55,924 --> 00:57:56,964
Best?

436
00:58:13,026 --> 00:58:14,426
Eighteen seconds.

437
00:58:14,986 --> 00:58:16,266
Am I good or am I right?

438
00:58:16,529 --> 00:58:18,089
What do I tell you
about overconfidence?

439
00:58:18,365 --> 00:58:18,885
You know what they say...

440
00:58:19,116 --> 00:58:21,996
This is not a bluff if you can deliver.
- It's still bluffing.

441
00:58:22,868 --> 00:58:26,548
Well, this 'talkative'
thinking he can beat him.

442
00:58:27,041 --> 00:58:29,801
Let me see.

443
00:59:05,455 --> 00:59:06,895
You are not honest.

444
00:59:07,165 --> 00:59:10,445
I play to win.
Where do you recommend?

445
00:59:10,835 --> 00:59:13,875
I do not know... The mission...
The bell rings.

446
00:59:14,253 --> 00:59:16,133
What arrested you?

447
00:59:16,401 --> 00:59:17,401
You.

448
00:59:17,425 --> 00:59:20,465
Exactly, sometimes I have
a removal barrier...

449
00:59:20,844 --> 00:59:23,204
to its effect can achieve.

450
00:59:25,684 --> 00:59:28,124
Okay, gentlemen.
Your game is over.

451
00:59:28,894 --> 00:59:31,454
Dr. Francisco Anderson is a
widely renowned physicist...

452
00:59:31,773 --> 00:59:34,213
and the department's main
expert internal security...

453
00:59:34,524 --> 00:59:36,484
in the field of nuclear
weapons tactics.

454
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,180
Dr. Anderson showed
up at work yesterday.

455
00:59:39,488 --> 00:59:41,528
A BVD team was his home.

456
00:59:41,825 --> 00:59:46,185
Dr. Anderson, his wife and
two daughters, were lost.

457
00:59:46,622 --> 00:59:50,582
The FBI and the BVD are
an extensive study...

458
00:59:50,959 --> 00:59:53,559
but to date have not been met.

459
00:59:53,878 --> 00:59:55,398
Do they think the
family was kidnapped?

460
00:59:55,796 --> 00:59:59,236
Yes. And they get everything
from the closet to find them.

461
00:59:59,593 --> 01:00:02,593
The President asked for your help.

462
01:00:16,653 --> 01:00:18,133
Everybody out.

463
01:00:23,993 --> 01:00:27,873
What happens here? Who are you?
- Your new employer.

464
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:32,811
What you want?
- Six tactical nuclear weapons.

465
01:00:33,209 --> 01:00:37,569
Our Vietnamese friends will
plutonium, and expertise.

466
01:00:38,007 --> 01:00:40,807
Let's see what
America is worth...

467
01:00:41,136 --> 01:00:45,096
when a bomb exploded
in a New York subway.

468
01:00:46,182 --> 01:00:47,742
- Ga I help you...
- Yes it is.

469
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:50,019
Let me clarify this point.

470
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:55,230
You will help us, because you
Otherwise your whole family dies.

471
01:00:56,402 --> 01:01:03,322
One by one. Slowly and painfully.
Understood?

472
01:01:31,477 --> 01:01:32,477
Chess!

473
01:01:33,522 --> 01:01:34,722
I'll be here in.

474
01:01:36,316 --> 01:01:38,196
Yes, you have the address.

475
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:40,892
But...

476
01:01:46,701 --> 01:01:47,701
Checkmate.

477
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,380
I hate this game.

478
01:01:52,124 --> 01:01:54,404
But you're better.

479
01:01:58,547 --> 01:02:00,747
They have Dr. Anderson
and his family found.

480
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,930
According to Langley's
latest information...

481
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:08,059
are in his possession Santiago
drug cartel in Colombia.

482
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,796
The drug on the Santiago cartel?

483
01:02:11,854 --> 01:02:14,214
When I was in Delta Force, they
have destroyed their thirst.

484
01:02:14,438 --> 01:02:16,238
Well, they have a
new construction...

485
01:02:16,523 --> 01:02:18,643
in a remote area of
the Colombian Forest.

486
01:02:18,942 --> 01:02:20,822
Is the location known?

487
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:26,074
The drug barons control over
25,000 km² of Columbia.

488
01:02:26,578 --> 01:02:29,498
And there are hundreds on the
country scattered places.

489
01:02:29,828 --> 01:02:33,908
According to sources
Santiago has a business

490
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:40,052
Vietnamese with a group of former
employees headed by General Vinh Tran.

491
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:44,013
Vinh Tran?

492
01:03:57,503 --> 01:03:59,303
Do you know him?

493
01:04:03,675 --> 01:04:04,795
Is it?

494
01:04:07,137 --> 01:04:08,497
What did he do?

495
01:04:10,682 --> 01:04:13,202
He is the man my
mother was murdered.

496
01:04:27,449 --> 01:04:28,569
Open!

497
01:04:33,915 --> 01:04:38,435
Plutonium weapons.
How did you receive it?

498
01:04:43,132 --> 01:04:46,892
Your contact in Colombia
Felipe Juarez is a.

499
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,860
He will be here tomorrow afternoon
to gather for four hours.

500
01:04:51,681 --> 01:04:52,881
Why does he help us?

501
01:04:53,392 --> 01:04:57,832
Philip of the family murdered
by the man Santiago.

502
01:04:59,108 --> 01:05:00,828
That's a good reason.

503
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:04,220
Say that again.

504
01:05:15,748 --> 01:05:17,388
What is this tight.

505
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:21,006
In a few minutes you
have enough space.

506
01:05:21,338 --> 01:05:23,138
Three minutes into
the drop zone.

507
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:22,190
The house of our
contact A mile south.

508
01:07:37,268 --> 01:07:38,548
Santiago male.

509
01:09:21,251 --> 01:09:22,891
Goodbye contact.

510
01:09:34,889 --> 01:09:35,889
And now?

511
01:09:36,265 --> 01:09:40,465
This field every fifteen minutes
from air points of view.

512
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:45,431
That said hundreds of these
drug complexes in t country.

513
01:09:45,982 --> 01:09:48,942
Who is looking for a
needle in a haystack.

514
01:09:58,329 --> 01:09:59,529
I have an idea.

515
01:10:00,248 --> 01:10:02,288
Let's contact.

516
01:10:04,294 --> 01:10:07,654
We have satellite photos as needed.
"Do you have the coordinates?"

517
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:12,800
5 degrees, 53 minutes north.
75 degrees, 11 minutes West.

518
01:10:13,636 --> 01:10:15,916
I'm looking at satellite access.

519
01:10:34,074 --> 01:10:35,074
Calendar?

520
01:10:35,451 --> 01:10:38,571
Begin at 16:00 am
and ga from there.

521
01:10:42,917 --> 01:10:46,277
These are our boys.
Santiago do knokploeg.

522
01:10:46,879 --> 01:10:47,879
Ga slightly.

523
01:10:52,217 --> 01:10:56,177
Highlight the Jeep and follow
them back to square one.

524
01:11:17,995 --> 01:11:21,675
Stop here. Zoom.

525
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,600
I got you.
What, what are the coordinates?

526
01:11:33,133 --> 01:11:37,813
7 degrees, 16 minutes north.
77 degrees west 2 minutes.

527
01:11:38,848 --> 01:11:42,048
This is in the middle of the
jungle, just outside Medillin.

528
01:11:43,895 --> 01:11:46,015
We will contact as we have
the mission accomplished.

529
01:11:46,357 --> 01:11:47,477
Good luck, boys.

530
01:12:02,621 --> 01:12:04,341
How long?

531
01:12:04,707 --> 01:12:08,227
I do not know. This
material is very old.

532
01:12:08,587 --> 01:12:12,707
I'll give it to you until tomorrow morning.
- This is impossible.

533
01:12:14,886 --> 01:12:18,486
With sufficient motivation
nothing is impossible.

534
01:12:22,977 --> 01:12:25,937
You have tomorrow off.

535
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:42,930
I want to go home!

536
01:12:43,205 --> 01:12:46,405
- I know. US too.
- When?

537
01:12:46,876 --> 01:12:50,316
Coming soon baby. When the
father has finished his work.

538
01:12:55,051 --> 01:12:56,171
Come on.

539
01:12:56,636 --> 01:12:57,996
Where are you taking us?

540
01:13:09,984 --> 01:13:11,584
Choose one.

541
01:13:12,403 --> 01:13:13,483
What are you talking about?

542
01:13:13,507 --> 01:13:16,067
Choose the person who
will first be killed.

543
01:13:17,073 --> 01:13:18,193
I Do not!

544
01:13:18,449 --> 01:13:22,529
- Good. So, I choose you.
- No!

545
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:36,680
It's too valuable to kill.
Attempt.

546
01:13:56,613 --> 01:13:58,813
Maybe you want Dad to talk.

547
01:13:59,158 --> 01:14:01,958
Because if he does
not work anymore...

548
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:10,705
I will go tomorrow...
you must kill.

549
01:14:28,188 --> 01:14:30,788
The sun is down. How much more?

550
01:14:31,108 --> 01:14:33,708
Ten kilometers to
the camp, this way.

551
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:38,926
Okay. Forward.

552
01:15:44,141 --> 01:15:46,941
It's time.
- I'm almost finishing.

553
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:49,590
Sorry doctor, but
how you respect...

554
01:15:49,898 --> 01:15:51,098
when my word is not love?

555
01:15:51,692 --> 01:15:55,452
Wait. I give you a bomb, I
just a little more time.

556
01:15:55,861 --> 01:15:57,581
And that you start.

557
01:15:59,155 --> 01:16:01,955
After analyzing his
daughter to have murdered.

558
01:17:35,672 --> 01:17:39,792
You stay with my daughter!
No, Terry!

559
01:17:44,305 --> 01:17:45,345
Mom!

560
01:17:59,697 --> 01:18:03,817
Who made this? Leaves!

561
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:08,170
Come out, or they will happen!

562
01:18:11,249 --> 01:18:12,249
There he is!

563
01:18:43,574 --> 01:18:44,854
Who are you?

564
01:19:07,974 --> 01:19:10,334
You're going to tell me
what I want to know.

565
01:19:12,188 --> 01:19:16,708
Why do you suffer in the first place?
"That's my nature, I guess."

566
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,760
Let us know when he's
willing to talk.

567
01:20:12,371 --> 01:20:13,371
Good job.

568
01:20:13,790 --> 01:20:16,430
Have all the time been analyzed?
- Yes.

569
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:21,313
Bring the family to safety.
I must do something.

570
01:20:33,187 --> 01:20:34,187
Tran.

571
01:20:46,116 --> 01:20:53,676
Joshua McCord. You're
hard to eradicate.

572
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:56,828
Why did you do that?

573
01:20:59,172 --> 01:21:00,972
$ 200,000.

574
01:21:02,007 --> 01:21:05,367
The North wanted Vietnamese
You liked death.

575
01:21:06,012 --> 01:21:08,052
Why my wife?

576
01:21:10,516 --> 01:21:14,876
Why read it?
"I could not leave witnesses."

577
01:21:28,742 --> 01:21:31,102
Easy. I hear from you.
- Who are you?

578
01:21:31,496 --> 01:21:33,456
I am here for you and
your family for safety.

579
01:21:33,790 --> 01:21:35,430
Stay close and follow me.

580
01:21:39,879 --> 01:21:41,359
Wait. I'll be back.

581
01:21:44,091 --> 01:21:45,811
I have often wondered...

582
01:21:46,095 --> 01:21:48,695
what would happen if
we would meet again.

583
01:21:51,641 --> 01:21:53,081
We'll see.

584
01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:30,439
Come on. We'll get
you somewhere else.

585
01:22:34,892 --> 01:22:38,572
Wolf, where are you waiting?
- I have no idea.

586
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:47,350
- It's him?
- Yes.

587
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,512
Call.

588
01:26:23,043 --> 01:26:25,843
- You're safe now.
- Thank you

589
01:26:32,802 --> 01:26:34,282
Good work, Deke.

590
01:26:36,432 --> 01:26:37,432
Thank you.

591
01:26:40,686 --> 01:26:41,886
I had a good teacher.

592
01:26:47,359 --> 01:26:48,359
Let's go for it.

593
01:26:53,075 --> 01:26:55,915
- In between.
- Mr. President.

594
01:26:56,827 --> 01:26:58,467
We just received notice
from Delta Force.

595
01:26:58,745 --> 01:27:03,025
Dr. Anderson and his family
are safe and on the way home.

596
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:04,458
Thank God.

597
01:28:03,522 --> 01:28:05,962
- What is it?
- You file.

598
01:28:06,357 --> 01:28:07,557
It's clean.

599
01:28:09,485 --> 01:28:11,445
What do you mean, "clean"?

600
01:28:11,862 --> 01:28:14,622
That means that everything
can do what you want.

601
01:28:16,368 --> 01:28:17,488
Everything I want?

602
01:28:18,912 --> 01:28:21,272
So what do you want?

603
01:28:26,753 --> 01:28:29,833
I want the right to
be the president's man.

604
01:28:59,204 --> 01:29:01,244
Two minutes to destination, sir.

605
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,760
Good luck, sir.

606
