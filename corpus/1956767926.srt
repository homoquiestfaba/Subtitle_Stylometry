1
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,603
No, don't put me on hold.

2
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,037
How... You're the third person
I've spoken to.

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,074
Today, by the way.

4
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:43,443
I have water.

5
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,145
I don't have hot water, do you
understand there's a difference?

6
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:46,614
Can you get me some sugar,
honey?

7
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:48,848
- Okay, great.
- Thank you.

8
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,118
Then help me, please.

9
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,819
I had icicles in my hair
this morning.

10
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,255
Do you know what that's like?
No...

11
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,924
Oh! Oh! Oh!

12
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:59,360
- Oh, hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

13
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,662
- I'm sorry. Come on.
- Daniel!

14
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,564
Tomorrow, please.

15
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,433
Thank you.

16
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:07,066
Oh.

17
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:07,701
- I'm so sorry.
- It's...

18
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:13,106
Apologize to this nice lady.

19
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:14,641
Boys will be boys.
It's fine, really.

20
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:15,776
No, it's not.

21
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:18,578
Daniel, say you're sorry. Now.

22
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,148
Or do you wanna end up
on the naughty list?

23
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,150
I'm sorry I ran into you.

24
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:25,285
That naughty or nice list
really works, huh?

25
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:25,819
- What's she talking about?
- Nothing, honey.

26
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:32,459
I'll be right back.

27
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,161
I'm guessing by your lack
of stains, sweatpants,

28
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:36,329
and bloodshot eyes,
you don't have children.

29
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,466
No, I don't.

30
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:40,434
You probably popped right up
after eight hours of sleep,

31
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:43,303
took a nice, long, hot shower...

32
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:45,372
Actually, no.
My hot water heater's all...

33
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:46,873
Leisurely got dressed,
applied your perfect makeup

34
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:51,010
while watching
Good Morning America.

35
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:51,679
- That is so not my life.
- I love my children,

36
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,914
but parenting
is all your nightmares combined.

37
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:57,218
The one trump card parents have

38
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,687
is that kids know
Santa keeps a list.

39
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:02,690
So, yes,

40
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,626
the naughty or nice list
still works.

41
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,728
The world is a better place
because of it.

42
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:15,203
What?

43
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:16,704
Enjoy. Next.

44
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:18,806
Hi, can I get
a large vanilla latte

45
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:21,641
with a shot...

46
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,909
Make it three shots of espresso,

47
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,977
and a mocha capp to go?

48
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,413
- Okay.
- Thank you.

49
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:28,080
$7.75, please.

50
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,682
Thanks.

51
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:30,651
[chuckles]

52
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:33,721
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

53
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:36,789
Krissy Kringle?

54
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,191
Like Kris Kringle?

55
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:39,326
[laughs]

56
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,527
That's awesome.

57
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:41,495
You want some milk and cookies

58
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:43,363
to go with your latte?

59
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:44,164
I can get you some carrot sticks
for your reindeer.

60
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,832
Do you think any of that
is original?

Sorry, St. Nick.
Credit card's been declined.

64
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,874
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

65
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,676
Well, I don't have cash.

66
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,179
Here's...

67
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,382
Ah.

68
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:05,453
I need another quarter.

69
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,488
Come on.

70
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:12,526
Thanks, kid.

71
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:14,228
You're off the naughty list.

72
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,000
[cash register opens]

73
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,302
- [Krissy] Morning, Michaela.
- Morning.

74
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:23,371
- [Krissy] Hey, Jack.
- Hey.

75
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,908
- [Krissy] Hello.
- Hi.

76
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,516
Hi.

77
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,557
Everybody's a comedian.

78
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:45,892
Hey, there.

79
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,360
Hi. The usual.

80
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,529
Ah, thank you.
You're a lifesaver.

81
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,931
You look nice.

82
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,099
Oh.

83
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,401
Meeting a friend for lunch.

84
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:55,235
Does that say, "triple shot"?

85
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,837
- Hmm? Mm.
- Rough night?

86
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,273
Rough morning.

87
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:01,241
Jingle, jingle,
Miss Krissy Kringle.

88
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:04,043
And it continues.

89
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,778
She's heard them all, Philip.
Run along, now.

90
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,914
Helen needs to see you
in her office ASAP.

91
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,283
Get your sleigh bells
over there.

92
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,452
- Thank you, Philip. Bye-bye.
- Okay.

93
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,322
Oh, how do I look?
Like promotion material?

94
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:16,923
I don't have
any hot water at my house,

95
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,425
so I'm a mess.

96
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:19,826
You look great.

97
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:20,294
You really think
you're gonna get it?

98
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:22,729
I don't know.

99
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,664
I mean, I've brought in three
new accounts in the last month,

100
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:24,598
and the rumor is
they're gonna hire from within.

101
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,334
And two days ago,

102
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:28,302
Helen smiled at me
in the bathroom.

103
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,338
No teeth, but the corners
of her mouth did go up.

104
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,907
Go get it, girl.

105
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:36,577
[Krissy sighs]

109
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:57,398
Miss Kringle.

110
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,666
Yes.

111
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,468
We're setting you free today.

112
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:02,735
You can pick up your final check
from accounting.

113
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,037
Thank you so much for your work.

114
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:07,440
Have a good holiday.

[tapping keys]

116
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,044
I'm sorry, did you just fire me?

117
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,047
We released you, yes.

118
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,917
Released me.

119
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,086
Like an animal into the wild.

120
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,055
Why?

121
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:24,958
Cutbacks.

122
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,595
- Cutbacks?
- That's it.

123
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:31,063
Because I have been bringing in
new clients every month.

124
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,666
I thought
I was getting a promotion.

125
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,535
Oh.

126
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,710
No.

127
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:44,777
No, you know what?
You just... You can't... You...

128
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,079
You... You should know that...

129
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,081
You are going
on the naughty list.

[scoffs]

131
00:05:56,757 --> 00:06:01,528
- Fired?
- Released.

132
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,430
Returning me
to my natural habitat.

133
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,665
Unemployed and going nowhere.

134
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,100
I thought this was it, you know?

135
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:09,737
I thought this was a place I was
gonna make a name for myself.

136
00:06:09,738 --> 00:06:12,005
I'm clever-ish
and funny and smart, right?

137
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,942
Don't say anything
if you don't agree.

138
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,011
I agree.

139
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,379
God, and right before Christmas.

140
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,714
I knew her heart
was made of ice,

141
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,915
but this is really cold.

142
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,150
I know.

143
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:26,619
Well...

144
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,621
I let her have it.

145
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,156
Oh, my God.

146
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,124
Tell me what you said.

147
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,159
Told her she was rude
and oblivious and just angry.

148
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,863
And then I said a bunch of stuff
I can't even repeat.

149
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:39,999
You did not.

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,634
What I actually said
was more like,

151
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,705
"You're gonna end up
on Santa's naughty list."

and I'm weak.

I'm gonna die in the wild.

156
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:54,482
Maybe you should go back in
and give her a time-out as well.

157
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:57,050
Ha.

158
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,186
You know what?

159
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:01,154
They take all our best ideas,

160
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:02,855
we never get a raise or a bonus,

161
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,290
and nobody gets promoted.

162
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,726
Maybe this is a good thing.

163
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,427
I mean,
what am I supposed to do?

164
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,129
I literally had to borrow change
from a seven-year-old today.

00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,165
Lance is making money.

166
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:14,468
I mean, he's almost
a partner by now, right?

167
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:17,570
Yeah.

168
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:17,771
Yeah, but I'm not
gonna take money from him

169
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,072
until we're married.

170
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,741
It's been six years.

171
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,109
I mean, how long
should a girl have to wait?

172
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,078
Apparently six years.

and unemployed.

terrible right now, Krissy.

grab drinks or something.

Wait, you are the one
that told me to buy that house.

329

and she is the mind reader
in the family.

331

How come she didn't predict
the crash?

332
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,743
Well, she does...

333
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,912
Doesn't see everything. Shh.

334
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:47,647

we'd be home free.

335

- Mm.

What is this now?

338
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,891
[Carol] That is your next job.

339
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:00,560
It's only temporary,
but it'll do

340
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:02,828
till something better
comes along.

341
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,064
Wrapping presents at the mall.

342
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:08,434
- I'm not doing this.
- [Carol] It's too late.

343
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:09,302
I already texted Gloria.
Her grandson is the manager.

344
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,404
I told him you would be there
at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

Hey, come on, it's
the perfect job for a Kringle.

347
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,345
Okay, you understand
in other countries,

348
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,613
they force prisoners
to wrap presents.

349
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:22,582
It's a form of torture. No!

350
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,252
Don't be so dramatic.

351
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:27,353
I'm sure that Lance agrees
with me, don't you, honey?

352
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:29,356
Don't.

353
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,058
[chuckles]

354
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:33,959
And you get to wear
a cute little elf costume.

355
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,095
Oh, that
is definitely not happening.

356
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,164
I think elves earn
an extra 20 bucks a day.

357
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,233
Seriously?

358
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,271

Do you wanna come inside and
watch an old movie or something?

360
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,121
[Lance sighs]

361
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:03,822
I can't.

362
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:04,757
I have a pile of research.

363
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,592
Big deposition tomorrow.

364
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:07,760
Sure.

365
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:09,728
It's okay, it's fine.

366
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,330
Don't be mad.

367
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:14,066
I'm an associate.

368
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:14,734
It won't be like this forever,

369
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:16,368
I promise.

370
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,370
So why were you so quiet

371
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,173
when my mom asked
about us getting married?

372
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,309
[Lance] So that's really
why you're upset.

373
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,377
Because I didn't jump up
and tell your mom

374
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,146
that she has a wedding to plan.

375
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,081
Your silence was deafening.

376
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:31,317
I don't talk
about weddings, Krissy,

377
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:32,784
because you hate them.

378
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:33,686
- What?
- You...

379
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:35,921
The overcooked steak,

380
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,756
the Chicken Dance,

381
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:38,790
that Shout song.

382
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,058
Everybody hates that stuff!

383
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,860
My wedding's
not gonna be like that.

384
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,429
It is gonna be different, okay?

385
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,832
Most girls wanna get married

386
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:47,700
so they can have
their own personal prom.

387
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:50,102
I just...

388
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,137
Ugh,
I just want a new last name.

389
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,140
So you're using me.

390
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:54,707
Well, yeah.

391
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,576
[chuckles]

392
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,278
I love you, Krissy Kringle.

393
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:00,147
Come here.

394
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:01,648
I need you to.

395
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,152
Good night.

396
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:20,833
Debbie?

397
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,535
Wh...

398
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,504
What are you doing?

399
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:26,473
Um, just
some last-minute decorating.

400
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,442
Oh...

401
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,843
Candy canes.

402
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:32,445
It's not really your theme
this year.

403
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,781
Yeah, I know, right?

404
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:36,483
No, these won't...
These won't work at all.

405
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,885
You know...

406
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,590
A porch light doesn't count
as a decoration.

407
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,125
It's a shame that someone
with such a festive last name

408
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,862
is such a grinch.

409
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,764
This is Candy Cane Lane.

410
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,467
Show some respect!

411
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,835
It was not Candy Cane Lane
when I moved in, okay?

412
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,705
You are the nightmare
before Christmas,

413
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,474
Krissy Kringle!

414
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,176
Yes, you are.

Hello?

427
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:03,970
[plumber] Yeah, this
is the plumber.

428
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:04,871
This Krissy Kringle?

429
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,372
This is she.

430
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:06,739
[plumber]
That's your real name?

431
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,407
Yes.

432
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:09,408

434
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:11,443
Yes, Krissy Kringle,

435
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,644
who lives on Candy Cane Lane.

[rustling]

437
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,215
[plumber] Ma'am, you there?

438
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,250
Oh. Oh!

439
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:21,420
Oh.

Dean Patterson, right.
I'm sorry.

458
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,563

uh, Miss Kringle,

I'm... I'm sorry,
but my truck broke down.

00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:40,699

that water heater today.

[plumber] What?

464
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,674
What was that?

465

Are you in your pajamas,
drinking coffee?

00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,746
[plumber] What?
What are you talking about?

467
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:55,948
- Plaid pajamas?
- [plumber] No. I'm serious.

I'm sitting here
waiting for a tow right now.

Yes. Yes, you are.

aren't you? Admit it.

Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

Yup.

What's his story?

00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,250
Well, to start with, he speaks
with an Australian accent,

531

yet he is not Australian.

goes on walkabout.

- Yeah.

as fashionable as we are.

541
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:11,109
Hey, Ruth. Hey, Phyllis.
How's it going?

542
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,680
They can't hear me.

543
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,347
Uh, oh, did he tell you
that the elves

544
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,284
have to work at Santa's
photo gallery as well?

545
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:21,620
- What?
- Yup.

546
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:23,121
Put on a happy face.
You're gonna need it.

547
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:24,522
No, no, I'm not trained
to work the photo gallery.

548
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,158
Oh.

549
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:27,627
Okay, well, question.

550
00:25:27,628 --> 00:25:30,261
Do you know

551
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,163
what this word means?

552
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:34,734
- Yeah.
- Great.

553
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,269
And...

554
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,606
Can you do this?

555
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,308
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, wait for it.

556
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:45,912
And then back again.

557
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:48,780
Got it.

558
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:49,015
Guess what.
You just got trained.

559
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:51,150
[laughs]

560
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,019
Merry Christmas.

561
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,189
Got another load for the elves.

562
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,158
What?

563
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,360
I thought it was break time.

564
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,629
You were 15 minutes late.
That was your break.

565
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,965
Another hour and a half
till lunch.

566
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:07,734
What is this, Santa's workshop
or Santa's sweatshop?

567
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:14,005
You know what?
Let's get out of here.

568
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,307
He's gonna be trying
to level up for the next hour.

569
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,009
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

570
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,712
Let's go.

571
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:21,080
Honestly,
I thought my old boss was bad.

572
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:24,183
I went from Helen of Troy
to a Napoleonic elf.

573
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:27,252
- Who's also a liar and a cheat.
- What are you talking about?

574
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,788
All right, well,
the wrapping station

575
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:30,922
is sponsored
by the senior center.

576
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,691
Uh-huh.

577
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:33,592
Justin's grandma
is the chairwoman,

578
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,727
so that's how he got his job.

579
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:37,428
Well, I figured
it wasn't based on merit.

580
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,364
Okay, but they used to give
a petty cash fund

581
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:42,333
for the managers to buy snacks
and drinks for the staff.

582
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,270
- That's sweet.
- Right?

583
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,138
- So where are the snacks?
- Exactly.

584
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:47,372
Ever since Justin took over,
he's like,

585
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:49,775
"Oh, sorry, mate.

586
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,176
We stopped doing it.
You know how it is."

587
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:53,344
He throws around
the word "recession"

588
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,579
like he knows what it means.

589
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,514
So you're saying he's stealing.

590
00:26:55,515 --> 00:26:57,916
I think so.

591
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,751
But I can't prove it,
so what is an elf to do?

592
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:01,721
I got bills to pay
just like everybody else.

593
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,724
Don't wanna go
rocking the sleigh.

594
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:06,358
["Jingle Bells" playing]

595
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:27,013
Stop it.

596
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,680
Stop.

597
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:29,949
[gasps]

598
00:27:35,755 --> 00:27:39,391
Ow!

599
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:43,561
A kitten hugging a puppy?
That's hilarious, Ruth.

600
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:47,432
And, Phyllis, I heard
you took second place

601
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:48,800
at the gin rummy tournament
last weekend.

602
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:50,201
Congratulations.
That's fantastic.

603
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:52,271
Ugh.

604
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,707
Excuse me, ladies. One second.

605
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:56,709
Are you kidding me?

606
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,011
I've seen five-year-olds
wrap better.

607
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:01,280
Let me explain.

608
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:04,449
Right, you fold it straight...

609
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,885
One piece of tape.

610
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,320
You use
more than one piece of tape,

611
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:11,723
you're doing it wrong.

612
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:12,591
Keep doing it wrong,
and you're fired.

613
00:28:12,592 --> 00:28:14,426
Understand?

614
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:17,296
Or should I speak slower?

615
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,301
Good.

616
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,337
Keep up the Christmas cheer.

617
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:27,339
[Marco sighs]

618
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:31,811
Hat on!

619
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:33,312
[sighs]

620
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:37,383
I'll be right back.

621
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:47,059
Where are you going?

622
00:28:47,493 --> 00:28:48,761
Krissy!

623
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:09,180
Justin Reid.

624
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:10,581

Check...

630
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,102
mate.

631
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:31,804
[video game sounds]

632
00:29:35,141 --> 00:29:36,008
Please go back to the workshop.

633
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:40,512
Okay.

634
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:44,082
Hey, um, sorry.

635
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:44,984
Is this about that thing
that I told you about?

636
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:46,852
'Cause that's
just between you and me.

637
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:48,453
- It's okay. Where's the money?
- Oh.

638
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,021
- What is this, a shakedown?
- Just...

639
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,824
The petty cash
from the senior center.

640
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:53,960
I told you,
cutbacks and recession.

641
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:57,963
Oh. You're sure about that?

642
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,065
Wait, what...

643
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,267
[Krissy gasps]

644
00:30:01,268 --> 00:30:02,334
Justin.

645
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:06,737
You thief!

646
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:07,406
What would Grams think, Justin?

647
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:11,177
[without an accent]
Don't tell Grams.

648
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:13,611
If she finds out,
she'll cut me off. Please.

649
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:16,848
I'll do whatever you want.

650
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:18,049
It's okay,
we're not gonna say anything

651
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,986
on three conditions.

652
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:21,420
One, you are gonna buy
the staff snacks.

653
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:25,756
And lunch
for the rest of the week.

654
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:26,458
Yeah, and that means
actual food.

655
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:28,294
Something that's not
gonna make us diabetic.

656
00:30:28,295 --> 00:30:30,862
Two...

657
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:31,463
Show some respect.
Stop demeaning everyone.

658
00:30:31,464 --> 00:30:34,166
I do that?

659
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,667
- A lot.
- [Krissy] Three...

660
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,702
You're gonna let me borrow all
these extra holiday decorations.

661
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,471
You're gonna take all
of this stuff out of here?

662
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:42,373
No, no, mate.

663
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:42,975
You are.
My address is right here.

664
00:30:42,976 --> 00:30:44,944
Forget that.

665
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:46,913
I mean, it's cool.
We can call Grams.

666
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:50,182
Yeah, we could
totally call Grams.

667
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:52,617
She's really good friends
with my mom.

668
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:53,452
No, no, no, fine. Fine. You win.

669
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,621
Uh, Marco,
order lunch for everyone.

670
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:58,590
With pleasure.

671
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,796
Oh.

672
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:06,465
There you go. That's better.

673
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,504
[sighs]

674
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:14,206
That was sick!

675
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:16,908
It really was fun
watching him grovel.

676
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:18,743
How did you know
where the money would be?

677
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:19,478
Are you psychic or something?

678
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:21,879
No, no, I had some help.

679
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,316
Well,
tell me about it over lunch.

680
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,351
Oh, I have to meet my boyfriend.
He's, um... where's...

681
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:29,621
He's actually not gonna make it.

682
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,323
- Oh.
- Figures.

683
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:34,059
Hey, it's all right, look,

684
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,660
you know
what'll never stand you up?

685
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:36,495
A sandwich, my treat. Come on.

686
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:45,770
Ah, I still can't believe
you called him out like that.

687
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:47,705
And blackmailed him.
You should consider politics.

688
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,574
We'll see how my yard
turns out, right?

689
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,709
Yeah, right?

690
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,910
Uh, I need a Turkey,
no Mayo, on wheat.

691
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,980
I'll get a veggie wrap,
gluten free.

692
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:57,282
Excuse me, you guys
not go to kindergarten?

693
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:58,883
Don't know how a line works?

694
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:01,452
- We were next.
- Oh, no!

695
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,421
We're not gonna get anything
in our stockings this year.

696
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:07,458
Wait, so you actually walk
around in public like that?

697
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:10,928
Aren't you taking the whole
holiday spirit a little too far?

698
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,564
Hmm, aren't you taking
your makeup a little bit too...

699
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:16,102
Psst.

700
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:22,308
Save our spots.
I'll be right back.

701
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,577
I have to get a picture of this.

702
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:32,550
- Putting this one on Facebook.
- [Marco] Okay, stop.

703
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:33,719
Stop. No, stop.

704
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,555
[tinkling]

705
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,525
- [Tiffany] Smile.
- [Marco] No. Okay, that's...

706
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,728
Do... Do not tag me.

707
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:44,762
[cell phone camera clicks]

708
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:46,031
[Tiffany] It's for Twitter.

709
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:49,167
Hi, Tiffany, Brittany.

710
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:53,004
A little holiday spirit
for you guys.

711
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,939
Brittany, stop telling everyone
Tiffany's bulimic. She's not.

712
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,276
- And, Tiffany...
- What?

713
00:32:58,277 --> 00:32:58,644
Stop texting Brittany's
boyfriend she's cheating on him.

714
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,845
That's rude.

715
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,113
Why would you do that?

716
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:04,082
I would never
do something like that.

717
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,616
I can't believe you told
people I was bulimic.

718
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:06,684
- You know I'm not anymore.
- I didn't say that!

719
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:07,753
Happy holidays!

720
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,855
It may have slipped out
a long time ago.

721
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:12,157
What do you mean, "slipped out"?
Things don't slip out.

722
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:14,326
Okay, what is going on here,
all right?

723
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:16,694
Are you... Are you
like a witch or something?

724
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,330
It's a gift.

725
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:20,032
Hi. We're next.

726
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:22,768
Spill it.
Don't tell me it's a gift.

727
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:27,072
I wrap gifts.
This is not a gift, all right?

728
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:28,340
This is like voodoo
or something.

729
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,775
You're gonna think I'm insane.

730
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:32,243
Don't make me use
drastic measures.

731
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:32,644
I don't even know
what it is for sure.

732
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:36,847
All right, don't think
that I haven't learned

733
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:37,616
some tactics
from these kids, all right?

734
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,017
I have seen moms
break in seconds.

735
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,120
- I can break you!
- Fine.

736
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:44,389
I will tell you.

737
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,656
But you are the only person,
do you understand?

738
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:46,392
'Cause if anybody else
finds out,

739
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:49,294
I will end up in the loony bin.

740
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:50,461
Okay, I'm like Fort Knox,
I promise.

741
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:52,364
[man] Number seven, please.

742
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,066
[bell rings]

743
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:02,640
What is this,
your book of spells?

744
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:06,777
Sort of.

745
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,413
Can I ask you an honest
and direct question?

746
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:10,615
As opposed to a deceitful
and ambiguous one? Proceed.

747
00:34:10,616 --> 00:34:12,651
- That's funny.
- Thank you.

748
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:14,520
Do you think there is
a real naughty or nice list?

749
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:17,488
The naughty or nice list.

750
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,457
Every year, because of my name
and the street I live on,

751
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:21,159
I get thousands of letters

752
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,160
intended
for the real Kris Kringle.

753
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:24,462
Right.

754
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:25,796
I'm sorry, back it up.

755
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:26,632
The real Kris Kringle?

756
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:28,433
Santa Claus.

757
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:29,467
Yes, I got the connection.

758
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:30,402
So just for argument's sake,

759
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:32,138
let's say
he really is watching us,

760
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:35,440
and he really does know

761
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:37,074
whether or not
we've been naughty or nice.

762
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,110
- I know how it sounds.
- Do you?

763
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,813
Good. No, hey,
sounds perfectly reasonable.

764
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,683
Look, I do believe that somebody

765
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,319
is watching over us
and all that,

766
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,087
but not Santa Claus,
'cause I was raised catholic.

767
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:54,959
Can you just go with me here?

768
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,562
[laughing] I'm trying.

769
00:34:57,563 --> 00:34:58,563
What if there is a little bit
of magic this time of year?

770
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:02,167
And what if the list is real,

771
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:03,169
and it's not just this thing
that parents use

772
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,771
to threaten
their kids to behave?

773
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:07,473
And what if it was
accidentally sent to me?

774
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,710
Those are a lot of "what ifs."

775
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,147
And you thought I wouldn't
put you in the loony bin?

776
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,849
- Okay.
- Check this out.

777
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:21,287
All right.

778
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:23,855
Marco Webb.

779
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,557
[tinkling]

780
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:28,327
"Told girlfriend he was sick,
then went to a sports bar"?

781
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:35,201
How does it know that?

782
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:37,902
Shh, sit down.

783
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:38,570
And that... That is private.

784
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,209
How...

785
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:47,778
So crazy,

786
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:48,647
but this might be
the real naughty or nice list.

787
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:50,749
Who else would have
a book like this?

788
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:53,618
The CIA.

789
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:55,152
'Cause they care that you lied
to your girlfriend.

790
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,654
Hey, I am
a pretty important guy,

791
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,490
so maybe.

792
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:00,459
All right, this just appeared
on your doorstep?

793
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:05,095
- Yeah.
- And have...

794
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,931
Have you told anybody else?

795
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:09,200
No, I don't want anyone...

796
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:10,835
You know,
let's make that two, to go.

797
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:11,903
- [Marco] What's the matter?
- Oh, God.

798
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:15,473
It's my old boss and Jill.

799
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:16,508
- [man] That'll be $5.50.
- Okay, thank you.

800
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,244
Which one is Jill?

801
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:20,778
Is she foxy blue,
or the ice queen?

802
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:21,547
Shh!
Just tell me when they're gone.

803
00:36:21,548 --> 00:36:23,648
Okay.

804
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:24,450
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

805
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,386
[gasps]

806
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:31,122
Oh, and she's looking at me.

807
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:33,525
Are they gone?

808
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,261
And we're clear.

809
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:36,928
What was that about?

810
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:39,630
"Foxy blue" is Jill.

811
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,266
I worked with her at my old job
at an advertising agency.

812
00:36:41,267 --> 00:36:45,035
Wow, you went
from ad exec to elf.

813
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,339
That is a letdown.

814
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,241
I got fired, and now Jill is
coffee buddies with the boss.

815
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:53,812
Something's not right
about that.

816
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:55,581
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

817
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:57,383
You can't just wield that thing.

818
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,417
Jill Rhodes.

819
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:00,785
Or maybe you can.

820
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:01,753
[tinkling]

821
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:05,223
"Stole promotion
from Krissy Kringle."

822
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:09,828
[man] Number eight, please.

823
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:12,831
That backstabbing...

824
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,099
[bell rings]

825
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,634
All right, let's wrap this up

826
00:37:15,635 --> 00:37:17,902
before you go all Vesuvius on us

827
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:19,904
and cover us in ash.

828
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,071
Can we take these to go?

829
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,507
Jill was my mentor.

830
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:24,342
And, I mean, I thought
she was my friend.

831
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:26,311
What do I know?

832
00:37:26,312 --> 00:37:26,778
You two ever
go shopping together?

833
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:28,946
No.

834
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,147
Not a friend.

835
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:31,116
You know what? You're right.

836
00:37:31,117 --> 00:37:32,950
She wasn't my friend,

837
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,184
she stole my ideas,

838
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,487
she passed them off as her own,

839
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:37,488
she told Helen
I was hitting on her husband.

840
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:41,091
That's insane. He's, like, 50.

841
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,461
Wait, so you knew him, then.

842
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,096
Yeah, we talked
about reality television

843
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,366
at company parties.

844
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:49,834
Well, that can get passionate.

845
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:50,135
Especially if they're about any
of the Real Housewives.

846
00:37:50,136 --> 00:37:52,803
[chuckles]

847
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:53,872
She betrayed me.

848
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:58,076
I'm gonna go in there on Monday
and just tell them everything.

849
00:37:58,077 --> 00:38:00,045
Tell them what, exactly?

850
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,647
That you found
Santa's naughty or nice list?

851
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:05,450
They'll have you committed.

852
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:07,017
And then what happens
to the book

853
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,619
if she gets her hands on it?

854
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,187
Well, I can't just
let her get away with it.

855
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:10,922
That's fine, but we gotta
be methodical about this.

856
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:14,291
All right, now,

857
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,393
probably got a line of kids

858
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:17,094
waiting to see Santa.

859
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,228
Let's deal with that,
then we'll get back

860
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,064
to "Operation Kill Jill" later.

861
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:21,432
All right? Let's go. Let's go.

862
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,369
And we'll go.

863
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:26,705
[soft Christmas music plays]

864
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:12,016
Unbelievable.

865
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,018
[chuckles]

866
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:16,388
Oh, gold star, Justin.

867
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:24,028
Debbie. Hi.

868
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,030
What do you think?

869
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:28,099
Compliments
the porch light, huh?

870
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,001
[Debbie] Very nice.

871
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:32,137
I love this little family
of snowmen! They're so cute!

872
00:39:32,138 --> 00:39:34,573
Do you think I have a chance

873
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:38,142
of winning
the holiday house contest?

874
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:40,277
Well, it's nice not to have
a black hole on the street.

875
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:42,847
I'm sure
that's worth some merit.

876
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,149
Hmm.

877
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,584
I don't know,

878
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:47,052
I think I've got a real shot.

879
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:48,153
When do we vote?

880
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:50,154
Check your newsletter.

881
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:52,157
Huh.

882
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:05,136
Excellent.

883
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:31,762
[Lance] You've
reached Lance Leigh.

884
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:32,897
Leave me a message.

885
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:34,098

886
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,199
Hey, Mr. Attorney.

887
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,801
I got your flowers. Thank you.

888
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:38,203
You're off the hook this time.
But call me, okay?

889
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:40,806
There's, um,
some crazy stuff going on.

890
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:44,175
I just wanna talk
to you about it.

891
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,177
I think.

892
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:56,488
[sighs]

893
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:06,296
- [sighs]
- [Jill] Hi, this is Jill.

894
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,632
Leave me a message if you dare.

895
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:08,699
I'll call you back if I care.

896
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,067
[Jill chuckles]

897
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:11,235
[beep]

898
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:12,336
Hey, Jill, it's Krissy,

899
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:13,071
your great, great friend.

900
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:16,440
Um, just wanting to get

901
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:18,442
those drinks
that we talked about.

902
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:20,010
So call me back. I can't wait.

903
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:22,614
Bye.

904
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:29,220
[mysterious music plays]

905
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:58,617
Debbie O'Brien.

906
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,185
[tinkling]

907
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:11,162
That little weasel.

908
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,203
Excellent.

909
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:19,905
[neighbors talking
indistinctively]

910
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:29,681
Hey.

911
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:34,653
Wow!
What is this winter wonderland?

912
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,624
This is unbelievable.

913
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:41,792
- I know, right?
- Justin really did a good job.

914
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:44,162
That Grams must be
a real gravy train.

915
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,297
Well, I just hope it's enough

916
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,666
to beat my neighbor Debbie
over here.

917
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:50,000
I'm calling out
that kleptomaniac tonight.

918
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:52,202
All right.

919
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:53,370
Thank you for coming,
by the way.

920
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:53,805
Ah, please.
This is better than shark week.

921
00:42:53,806 --> 00:42:56,006
[both chuckle]

922
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:57,175
This is quite the turnout.

923
00:42:58,209 --> 00:42:59,177
[Krissy] We're entering
the lion's den.

924
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:00,712
Ooh, maybe they got cake pops.
I'll be right back.

925
00:43:00,713 --> 00:43:02,914
Marco.

926
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:04,749
Krissy!

927
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,116
I love what you did
to your house.

928
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:07,185
Oh.

929
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:08,987
Everyone is talking
about how beautiful it is.

930
00:43:08,988 --> 00:43:10,188
I posted it on Pinterest,

931
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,090
and so far it has gotten
over 2,000 repins!

932
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,661
- Wow.
- It's a sensation!

933
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:17,228
Oh, yeah, thank you.

934
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:19,563
Okay, let's everyone
take our seats.

935
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:21,031
The meeting is about to begin.

936
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:23,033
Thank you.

937
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:23,935
They've got mini cupcakes.

938
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:27,137
Don't leave me alone
with these people again.

939
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:29,774
[laughs]

940
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:31,642
[bells jingle]

941
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:32,777
- [Marco] What does that mean?
- [Krissy] I do not know.

942
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:33,945
Take your seats, everyone.
Welcome.

943
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:37,915
Welcome,
Candy Cane Lane neighbors.

944
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:40,350
As you know, tonight
we are going to select

945
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:41,953
the best holiday house.

946
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,955
But I think,

947
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:46,123
with the huge turnout
of spectators

948
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,492
that we've had every evening

949
00:43:48,493 --> 00:43:49,327
that it is safe to say
that we are all winners.

950
00:43:49,328 --> 00:43:51,362
[applause]

951
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:56,267
[Krissy clears her throat]

952
00:43:56,802 --> 00:43:57,969
[whistles]

953
00:43:58,603 --> 00:43:59,871
Debbie.

954
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:02,273
Krissy has a question.

955
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:05,042
Oh. Krissy, I apologize.

956
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:07,444
You never come to these things.

957
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:09,046
You can imagine
why I might overlook you.

958
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:10,380
Oh, I just... I didn't get
a chance to cast my ballot.

959
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:13,218
Oh, that's unfortunate.

960
00:44:15,053 --> 00:44:16,553
The ballot box
was right over there

961
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:18,088
by the dessert table.

962
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:20,991
Oh, well.

963
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:21,727
That's why punctuality
is the politeness of kings.

964
00:44:21,728 --> 00:44:24,561
Oh, come on, Debbie.

965
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:25,796
- Just let her vote.
- Yeah.

966
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:26,297
It's so nice to have her
join in this year.

967
00:44:26,832 --> 00:44:29,299
[applause]

968
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,968
Let her vote! Come on!

969
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:31,636
- Come on!
- Thank you, guys.

970
00:44:31,637 --> 00:44:33,537
All right, okay.
It is Christmas.

971
00:44:33,538 --> 00:44:34,740
Please, bring
your ballot to my assistant.

972
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:37,743
By the way,
you can't vote for yourself.

973
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:42,680
Yes, Debbie. I'm well aware.

974
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:45,450
Okay.
This is so exciting, right?

975
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:49,287
Ahh!

976
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:52,758
Do we have the results?

977
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:56,061
Here we go.

978
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,865
Second runner-up,

979
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:01,800
winner of a 60-piece
Tupperware set...

980
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:05,770
Sixty.

981
00:45:05,771 --> 00:45:07,404
With four votes,
Brenda and David Weir.

982
00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:11,308
That's great. We won.

983
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:12,477
There's your Tupperware.

984
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,280
[Brenda chuckles]

985
00:45:16,281 --> 00:45:17,714
Fantastic.

986
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,183
[Brenda chuckles]

987
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:21,551
[mild applause]

988
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,887
You are gonna keep
a lot of things fresh.

989
00:45:22,888 --> 00:45:24,489
And now the first runner-up,

990
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:29,426
and the winner
of a one-year membership

991
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:31,261
to the cheese
of the month club...

992
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:33,230
Yum.

993
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,132
[chuckles]

994
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:36,400
Oh.

995
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:37,135
With seven votes,
Krissy Kringle.

996
00:45:37,136 --> 00:45:39,269
Hey!

997
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,504
[applause]

998
00:45:40,505 --> 00:45:41,472
Huh. Huh, all right.

999
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:43,809
- Whoo!
- Congratulations, Krissy.

1000
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:46,511
You see what happens
when you participate?

1001
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:48,379
You win nice things.

1002
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:50,081
Noted.

1003
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:52,183
Okay, okay, okay.

1004
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:54,319
And here's the moment
that we've all been waiting for.

1005
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,187
The winner.

1006
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:58,089
Oh, my goodness! It's me!

1007
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,593
Oh!

1008
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,429
With eight votes,

1009
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:05,830
Debbie O'Brien.

1010
00:46:05,831 --> 00:46:07,564
Thank you.
Thank you all so much.

1011
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:09,100
It's such an honor.

1012
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:12,536
Hey, hey, let's give ourselves
a round of applause, huh?

1013
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:15,305
'Cause when Debbie wins,
we all win, don't we?

1014
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:18,542
[applause]

1015
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:22,079
Thank you, Krissy.

1016
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:22,848
Now, I don't wanna put
a damper on the festivities,

1017
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,117
but I do have to raise
just a small, little concern.

1018
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:29,387
I'm actually missing
some key pieces from my display.

1019
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:34,191
Does anybody know
anything about that?

1020
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:35,993
Well, kids like to play pranks
this time of year.

1021
00:46:35,994 --> 00:46:38,996
- Oh.
- No, no, no, she has a point.

1022
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:39,530
I had a bunch
of my candy canes go missing.

1023
00:46:40,932 --> 00:46:42,167
Brenda, it is so funny
you would say that.

1024
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:46,170
I saw Debbie
with an armful of candy canes

1025
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:48,139
just a few nights ago,
walking across her lawn.

1026
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:51,008
Krissy.

1027
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:52,042
Is anybody else

1028
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:52,810
missing anything?

1029
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:53,611
One of my wise men

1030
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:54,579
and a camel are MIA.

1031
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:58,415
Yeah, and my North Pole gnomes
have... psh... vanished.

1032
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:01,019
[Krissy] How about that?

1033
00:47:02,988 --> 00:47:04,088
Now, look, I don't wanna
jump to any conclusions,

1034
00:47:04,089 --> 00:47:05,156
but my gut is telling me

1035
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:08,625
if we take a peek
in Debbie's shed,

1036
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:10,327
we could probably
solve this mystery.

1037
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,963
Wha... What?

1038
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,464
To the backyard!

1039
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:17,302
- [Debbie] No, no! No, no, no!
- [Brenda] Everybody, follow me!

1040
00:47:17,302 --> 00:47:18,203
- Oh, this is crazy.
- No, no, no!

1041
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:20,737
No, no, everyone sit down.
What are you doing?

1042
00:47:20,738 --> 00:47:22,072
This is crazy! This is crazy!

1043
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:24,141
Go, go! Come on!

1044
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:25,610
[Debbie] This is ridiculous!
Come back here!

1045
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:28,213
[Brenda] This way!

1046
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,948
[Debbie] What are you doing?

1047
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,849
[man] Definitely been missing.

1048
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:33,919
[Brenda] Get ready, everybody!

1049
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,521
Open the doors!

1050
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:39,490
[all gasp]

1051
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:42,393
[man] Oh, my gosh!

1052
00:47:42,394 --> 00:47:43,760
Holy Moly!

1053
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:44,662
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

1054
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:45,496
It's not what you think.

1055
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:47,498
I...
I was gonna give it all back.

1056
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,634
Under the circumstances,

1057
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:54,671
I propose we revote
for the best holiday house.

1058
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:57,508
- Yeah, I agree.
- Wha...

1059
00:47:58,343 --> 00:47:59,210
All in favor of my house,

1060
00:47:59,211 --> 00:48:01,478
please raise your hands.

1061
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:02,247
- She did a good job.
- Yeah.

1062
00:48:05,183 --> 00:48:06,183
All in favor of Krissy's house,
please raise your hands.

1063
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:09,853
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

1064
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:10,588
- Great this year.
- Come on!

1065
00:48:10,589 --> 00:48:11,990
Finally, Debbie's house.

1066
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,992
[Brenda]
Yeah, I didn't think so.

1067
00:48:16,861 --> 00:48:17,528
Looks like you lost your title.

1068
00:48:18,663 --> 00:48:20,297
Congratulations, Krissy!

1069
00:48:20,298 --> 00:48:21,666
Whoo!

1070
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,068
[applause]

1071
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:26,271
Debbie,
you've disgraced yourself.

1072
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:30,774
I am taking my candy canes
and my Tupperware back.

1073
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:33,979
That I won, fair and square.

1074
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:48,092
- Congratulations, Krissy.
- Oh, thanks.

1075
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:49,560
[man] See my wise man
in there anywhere?

1076
00:48:51,963 --> 00:48:55,633
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

1077
00:48:58,036 --> 00:48:59,336
[man] Honey, grab that.
Grab that. That's ours.

1078
00:48:59,337 --> 00:48:59,670
- That's our... That's ours.
- [man 2] No, there's two.

1079
00:48:59,671 --> 00:49:01,805
There's two of them.

1080
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:02,640
[sad music plays]

1081
00:49:19,357 --> 00:49:23,560
Well, that was
my first Christmas lynch mob.

1082
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:25,963
Hmm.

1083
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,698
I kept waiting for somebody

1084
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:28,433
to yell, "kill the beast!"

1085
00:49:28,434 --> 00:49:31,835
What?

1086
00:49:31,836 --> 00:49:32,803
Oh, don't tell me you feel
sorry for her, do you?

1087
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:34,838
I didn't have to humiliate her.

1088
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:36,440
Ah, she humiliated herself.

1089
00:49:36,441 --> 00:49:39,743
- Great.
- Oh, don't tell me.

1090
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:41,911
Lance is working late again.

1091
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,081
It's none of my business,

1092
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:46,416
but why do you keep
putting up with that?

1093
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:47,385
It's not his fault.
He's trying to make partner.

1094
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:50,920
He's just trying to make
a good impression.

1095
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:54,691
It's just sometimes I wish

1096
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:55,692
he'd try to make
a good impression on me.

1097
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:58,428
So what's his deal?

1098
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:00,664
He doesn't wanna get married

1099
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:02,166
until his career
is where he wants it.

1100
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,867
He says he's getting
a good bonus this year.

1101
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:06,236
Like I care about that.

1102
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:08,505
So do you ever think
about, you know,

1103
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,641
using the list?

1104
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:12,343
Like, to give you peace of mind.

1105
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:15,712
If I do that,
that's like reading his emails.

1106
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:18,982
Where's the trust?

1107
00:50:18,983 --> 00:50:19,617
Look, if it were me,
I'd wanna know.

1108
00:50:19,618 --> 00:50:23,121
I'm just saying.

1109
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:29,127
I'm just saying.

1110
00:50:29,594 --> 00:50:30,628
Okay.

1111
00:50:32,163 --> 00:50:33,298
Good night.

1112
00:50:51,749 --> 00:50:55,453
[sighs]

1113
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:04,661
[sighs]

1114
00:51:04,662 --> 00:51:06,063
Lance Leigh.

1115
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:09,733
[pages rustle]

1116

[gasps]

1119
00:51:20,145 --> 00:51:21,745
Oh.

1120
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:22,547
[tense music plays]

1121
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,457
Hi, um, I'm looking for, uh...

1122
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:34,758
He's a guy. He's here with...

1123
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:35,860
Found him.

1124
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:37,562
He lives!

1125
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:41,732
Krissy. Is everything okay?

1126
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:43,468
It was.

1127
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:45,602
Till I found out you are lying,

1128
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:46,736
cheating scum of the earth.

1129
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,339
Excuse us.

1130
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:51,309
You know what? They need
to know your true colors.

1131
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:52,510
Especially you, Mrs. Harris.

1132
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:55,078
If you're considering
making him partner,

1133
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:57,514
you should know
his true colors, right?

1134
00:51:57,515 --> 00:51:59,216
- Krissy, stop it.
- [Krissy] I trusted you.

1135
00:51:59,217 --> 00:52:00,251
For six years,
I gave you everything,

1136
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,489
and this is how you repay me?

1137
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:06,590
By lying to me
and cheating on me?

1138
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:09,826
What are you talking about?

1139
00:52:09,827 --> 00:52:11,395
All those "late nights"
you were working,

1140
00:52:11,396 --> 00:52:12,230
you were really with Jill,
weren't you?

1141
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:13,764
Guilty or not?

1142
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:16,233
Okay,
that is not what you think.

1143
00:52:16,234 --> 00:52:16,734
I knew it! You just admitted it.
It's guilty!

1144
00:52:16,735 --> 00:52:19,769
Krissy, my boss is here.

1145
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:21,571
I know.

1146
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:22,972
Ms. Harris, you're a lady.

1147
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,641
I'm sure you understand, right?

1148
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:27,977
[Ms. Harris] Oh!

1149
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,280
[man] Are you kidding me?

1150
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:48,298
[sighs]

1151
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:50,400
Excuse me.

1152
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:51,436
[Marco] Big smile.

1153
00:52:53,538 --> 00:52:54,539
That's a great one.

1154
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:56,907
There you... Oh, even better.

1155
00:52:56,908 --> 00:52:58,942
There you go.

1156
00:52:58,943 --> 00:52:59,577
All right, what's a mouse eat?

1157
00:52:59,578 --> 00:53:00,777
That's right. Cheese.

1158
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,313
Okay, all right.

1159
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:05,215
One more, just for you.

1160
00:53:05,216 --> 00:53:06,551
Excellent. All right, good job.

1161
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,886
Merry Christmas.

1162
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:10,855
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, no.
Up, now.

1163
00:53:10,856 --> 00:53:13,424
That's not
how we do things here.

1164
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:18,262
Did you hear me say "next"?

1165
00:53:18,263 --> 00:53:19,763
- I wanna see Santa.
- All right, great.

1166
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:20,565
You're gonna see Santa
when it's your turn.

1167
00:53:21,299 --> 00:53:23,032
What's the difference?

1168
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,167
That Santa's fake,

1169
00:53:24,168 --> 00:53:24,969
and you're too big to be an elf.

1170
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:27,304
This is lame!

1171
00:53:27,305 --> 00:53:28,538
Excuse me?
I want you to know something.

1172
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,575
Santa's helpers come in
all shapes and sizes.

1173
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:33,810
And some of us are just trying
to make a living, okay?

1174
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:35,980
Whatever, lady.

1175
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:37,748
No, not "whatever."

1176
00:53:37,749 --> 00:53:39,916
I want you to know something.

1177
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:41,485
Santa has eyes everywhere,

1178
00:53:41,486 --> 00:53:43,953
and nothing, I mean nothing,
goes unnoticed.

1179
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:46,723
Do you understand?

1180
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:47,957
Krissy.

1181
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,426
It's fine. I got it.

1182
00:53:49,427 --> 00:53:51,228
He is watching and recording

1183
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,331
every naughty thing you do.

1184
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:55,965
And trust me, in your case,

1185
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:57,233
it is a huge collection.

1186
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,370
You're crazy.

1187
00:54:00,305 --> 00:54:01,606
- I'm crazy?
- [kids laugh]

1188
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,541
Oh, that's funny, huh?
All right.

1189
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:06,344
You think
you can just lie and cheat

1190
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:08,845
and not be held accountable?

1191
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:09,914
You're so wrong!

1192
00:54:10,615 --> 00:54:12,015
Because Santa knows all!

1193
00:54:12,016 --> 00:54:15,552
He's got a list.

1194
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:16,120
And one day, you're gonna
wake up and think,

1195
00:54:16,121 --> 00:54:17,622
"Oh, I'm gonna get

1196
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,424
this great present
for Christmas!"

1197
00:54:20,425 --> 00:54:21,659
But instead, you are gonna
be single and unemployed

1198
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,929
and too weak and intimidated
to do anything about it!

1199
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:30,033
Okay, all right!

1200
00:54:30,034 --> 00:54:32,035
All right. Here we go.

1201
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:33,904
Her blood sugar's way down.

1202
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,072
Where are your parents?

1203
00:54:36,073 --> 00:54:37,408
Come on, now. All right.

1204
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,644
What was that?

1205
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:41,412
I don't know, I don't know.

1206
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:44,381
Oh, God, Marco, I'm sorry.
I lost it.

1207
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:46,283
Yeah! That's a bit
of an understatement.

1208
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:48,686
What happened?

1209
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,455
I checked on Lance in the book.

1210
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,523
He cheated on me with Jill.

1211
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,994
Yeah.

1212
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:00,665
I guess I would've lost it too.
Um...

1213
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:03,968
Maybe not in front of Santa.

1214
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:05,670
It started earlier in the day.

1215
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:07,972
At Lance's business lunch.

1216
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:11,776
It was stupid.
It was so stupid. I know that.

1217
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:16,414
But I was just...

1218
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:18,315
I was hurt, and I was furious.

1219
00:55:19,283 --> 00:55:20,585
Lance isn't that guy.

1220
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:24,989
It's not like him.

1221
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:26,691
I wish
I'd never opened the book.

1222
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:29,927
[sad song plays]

1223
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:44,108
And initial.

1224
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:49,813
Thank you.

1225
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:50,881
[sighs]

00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:02,993
[reporter]
We'll bring youmore on
the story as it unfolds.

1227
00:56:03,828 --> 00:56:07,363
Everyone's a little disappointed

1228
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,265
by the lack of snow
on the mountains this year,

1229
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:11,034
but maybe now we know why it
hasn't been a white Christmas.

1230
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:13,370
Things got pretty heated today

1231
00:56:14,905 --> 00:56:16,840
when one of Santa's helpers
had a meltdown at the mall.

1232
00:56:16,841 --> 00:56:19,809
Shoppers captured this footage
that went viral earlier today.

1233
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:23,112
Not be held accountable?
You're wrong!

1234
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:26,716
Because Santa knows all!

1235
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,052
So one day, you think you're
gonna get a beautiful present,

1236
00:56:29,554 --> 00:56:31,789
but instead, you are gonna
be single and unemployed

1237
00:56:33,257 --> 00:56:35,125
and too weak and intimidated
to do anything about it!

1238
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:41,631
Okay, here we go.

1239
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:42,866
It's okay, all right.
Her blood sugar is...

1240
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:44,634
Where are your parents?

1241
00:56:44,635 --> 00:56:46,135
You better not pout,
you better not cry.

1242
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:47,871
This is one elf
who will soon find out why.

- [reporter] I'm Jane Lei...

1244
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:58,548
Mom? Dad?

1245
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:01,017
[both] Oh.

1246
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:02,185
Your mom thought you could use
some more ice cream about now.

1247
00:57:02,186 --> 00:57:04,054
- Huh?
- [Carol] Hi.

1248
00:57:04,722 --> 00:57:05,756
How are you, dear?

1249
00:57:06,691 --> 00:57:09,358
You guys know, huh?

1250
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,460
Of course we know, it's
already gone viral on YouTube.

1251
00:57:10,461 --> 00:57:13,362
Hey, this is about Lance,
isn't it?

1252
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:16,132
She who knows everything.

1253
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:18,702
Well, I...

1254
00:57:18,703 --> 00:57:19,703
Come on, tell us
what happened, sweetheart.

1255
00:57:19,704 --> 00:57:22,071
[Krissy] Oh, Daddy.

1256
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:24,608
He's cheating on me.

1257
00:57:24,609 --> 00:57:26,510
With Jill,
that girl I told you about.

1258
00:57:26,511 --> 00:57:28,478
The girl that stabbed me
in the back

1259
00:57:28,479 --> 00:57:29,547
and got me fired
and took my job.

1260
00:57:30,581 --> 00:57:34,183
Sounds like
a Country-Western song.

1261
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:35,553
Are... Are you sure about Lance?

1262
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:39,923
I mean, it just
doesn't sound like him.

1263
00:57:39,924 --> 00:57:41,224
Well, let's say I have it
on very good authority.

1264
00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:43,594
Sweetheart, you know,

1265
00:57:44,428 --> 00:57:45,895
this would not be the first time

1266
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,063
you've jumped to conclusions.

1267
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:48,798
No, but I... Ugh.

1268
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,099
And this affair is...
Is happening now?

1269
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,869
It's ongoing?

1270
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,703
I don't know.

1271
00:57:53,704 --> 00:57:55,338
Does it really matter when?

1272
00:57:55,339 --> 00:57:56,906
Could it have happened
maybe two summers ago?

1273
00:57:56,907 --> 00:57:59,876
When... When you took a break
to find yourself?

1274
00:57:59,877 --> 00:58:01,879
We were still together then.

1275
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,380
Really?

1276
00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:05,782
Because I had a depressed boy

1277
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:06,950
calling me twice a day
for over a month,

1278
00:58:06,951 --> 00:58:08,586
asking how to get you back.

1279
00:58:09,453 --> 00:58:10,588
He thought we were broken up?

1280
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:13,089
May I ask where you're getting
all this information

1281
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:15,391
about his alleged tryst?

1282
00:58:15,392 --> 00:58:17,161
Oh, I wanna tell you.

1283
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:19,162
I wanna tell you so bad.

1284
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:20,130
I can't, though.

1285
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:22,699
In mom's hands,
it would be a loaded weapon.

1286
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,168
Well, it sounds
like it already is.

1287
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,203
I will just say
there's two sides to every coin.

1288
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:29,740
You flip it over,
there's always another side.

1289
00:58:33,377 --> 00:58:34,511
She's right.

1290
00:58:37,748 --> 00:58:38,849
You're right.

1291
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,151
- You're right.
- Mm.

1292
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,520
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1293
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,055
Hey! Come on, it's the holidays.

1294
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:47,757
- I'm right.
- What a gyp.

1295
00:58:47,758 --> 00:58:48,893
[Carol chuckles]

1296
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:57,167
[playful music plays]

1297
00:58:58,769 --> 00:58:59,904
Lance Leigh.

1298
00:59:03,107 --> 00:59:04,174
[tinkling]

1299
00:59:09,346 --> 00:59:12,917
Oh, that's so sweet.

1300
00:59:14,118 --> 00:59:14,819
[Carol] I couldn't hear
what you said, honey.

1301
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,287
[tinkling]

1302
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:28,232
"Has never lied to Krissy Kringle."

1303
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:30,801
[Krissy sobs]

1304
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:35,605
Just one sec.

1305
00:59:35,606 --> 00:59:36,106
I'm sorry, honey,
what'd you say?

1306
00:59:38,743 --> 00:59:40,577
Just thank you.

1307
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:42,579
[Carol] Oh, honey.

1308
00:59:44,982 --> 00:59:46,050
Oh.

1309
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:02,298
This better be good.

1310
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:03,566
We don't go on the clock
for another hour.

1311
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:06,202
I have a plan to fix everything.

1312
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:08,237
With Lance?

1313
01:00:08,238 --> 01:00:09,405
With everyone.

1314
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:10,874
All right, I'm listening.

1315
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:12,376
What does this say?

1316
01:00:13,377 --> 01:00:15,278
Is that a trick question?

1317
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:16,880
Something like that.
Just tell me what it says.

1318
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:18,715
- It says, "naughty or nice."
- Except it's not "or."

1319
01:00:18,716 --> 01:00:21,584
It's not one or the other.
There's two sides to the book.

1320
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:24,854
Two totally different lists.

1321
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:26,923
Meaning you only had
half the story.

1322
01:00:26,924 --> 01:00:30,359
I never looked at it
from the other side.

1323
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,996
- The nice list.
- Yes.

1324
01:00:32,797 --> 01:00:34,764
I mean, nobody's perfect.

1325
01:00:34,765 --> 01:00:36,165
Just because
you're on the naughty list

1326
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:37,366
doesn't mean you can't be
on the nice list

1327
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:38,302
a whole lot more, right?

1328
01:00:39,003 --> 01:00:40,469
That's fair enough.

1329
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,305
Lance wasn't lying.

1330
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:43,040
He really was working
late nights.

1331
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:44,909
What about
his little escapade with Jill?

1332
01:00:47,011 --> 01:00:49,478
Yeah.

1333
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:50,247
They were together, barely.

1334
01:00:50,248 --> 01:00:52,916
Once.

1335
01:00:52,917 --> 01:00:53,784
When we were broken up.

1336
01:00:53,785 --> 01:00:55,019
What?

1337
01:00:57,021 --> 01:00:58,354
I missed that part.

1338
01:00:58,355 --> 01:00:59,323
Turns out I missed a lot
with everyone.

1339
01:00:59,324 --> 01:01:02,026
Even Jill?

1340
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:04,994
The woman volunteers
at a convalescent home.

1341
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:06,296
She probably steals
their social security checks.

1342
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,866
Well, I know she stole my job.

1343
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:11,667
Get this, she's been on payroll
at a rival firm,

1344
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,603
giving them insider information,

1345
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:15,872
so they can steal
Helen's clients.

1346
01:01:15,873 --> 01:01:17,041
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1347
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:19,308
The plan is to cripple
Helen's company,

1348
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:22,045
then buy her out,

1349
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:22,913
and then Jill will become
a partner in the new firm.

1350
01:01:22,914 --> 01:01:25,782
And the book had all of this?

1351
01:01:25,783 --> 01:01:26,516
All of it, in great detail.
This baby...

1352
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:28,318
Oh! Oh!

1353
01:01:28,753 --> 01:01:31,087
Oh, no.

1354
01:01:31,088 --> 01:01:32,221
Oh, oh, okay. No, I got it.

1355
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:33,457
- Come on.
- [Marco] Oh.

1356
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:36,326
Oh, this isn't happening.

1357
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,932
Krissy Kringle.

1358
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,468
Oh, no, no. Please.

1359
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:47,270
Krissy Kringle!

1360
01:01:47,271 --> 01:01:49,705
Oh, I ruined it.

1361
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:50,307
Okay, okay.
No, you can fix this.

1362
01:01:50,308 --> 01:01:53,910
How?

1363
01:01:53,911 --> 01:01:54,812
Listen, remember
when you had your little episode

1364
01:01:54,813 --> 01:01:58,147
in front of everyone,
and you said

1365
01:01:58,148 --> 01:02:00,049
that you were gonna end up
weak and intimidated?

1366
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,186
That is not the Krissy
that I met here on day one.

1367
01:02:03,187 --> 01:02:05,990
That's because I had this.

1368
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,893
No, that is just a crutch.

1369
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:11,727
You've always had
that strength inside of you.

1370
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,931
But I didn't have all the names

1371
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:17,567
and information
I need to make my case.

1372
01:02:17,568 --> 01:02:21,104
Okay.

1373
01:02:21,105 --> 01:02:21,806
Well, it sounds
like you need a good lawyer.

1374
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,441
Well, we know
Mr. Hennessy was innocent,

1375
01:02:27,878 --> 01:02:29,645
because he was
at a family reunion

1376
01:02:29,646 --> 01:02:31,480
the night of August the 18th.

1377
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:32,082
[woman] Miss, you're not allowed
to be on the premises.

1378
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:34,984
[Krissy] It's an emergency.

1379
01:02:34,985 --> 01:02:36,119
[Ms. Harris] So if we do
our job, we can get him home

1380
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,453
for Christmas with his wife
and lovely daughters.

1381
01:02:37,454 --> 01:02:39,522
- Hi.
- Krissy.

1382
01:02:39,523 --> 01:02:41,391
What are you doing here?

1383
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:44,128
Everyone, it's okay.
I come in peace.

1384
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:46,396
I know that you hate me
right now,

1385
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:50,299
but we really need to talk.

1386
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,268
This is not the time or place.

1387
01:02:51,269 --> 01:02:53,536
Please, go home.

1388
01:02:53,537 --> 01:02:55,439
Should I call security?

1389
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,141
- No.
- Krissy...

1390
01:02:57,842 --> 01:02:59,142
Lance, I was wrong.

1391
01:02:59,143 --> 01:03:00,977
I jumped to conclusions,

1392
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:02,278
and if I'd looked
just a little bit closer,

1393
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:03,512
I would have realized
that you were only with Jill

1394
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,781
after we'd broken up.

1395
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:06,416
I was crushed.
I wasn't exactly myself.

1396
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:10,987
But Jill? Really?

1397
01:03:10,988 --> 01:03:13,156
No, no, no, I'm sorry.
I was wrong.

1398
01:03:13,157 --> 01:03:14,190
You are the most generous,
loving, kind man that I know.

1399
01:03:14,191 --> 01:03:17,394
And he's not a liar or a cheat.

1400
01:03:18,896 --> 01:03:21,165
In fact,
he's the exact opposite.

1401
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:23,167
He's everything
we look for in a man,

1402
01:03:24,201 --> 01:03:25,202
including being
very kind to a woman

1403
01:03:26,036 --> 01:03:28,771
in the middle of a meltdown.

1404
01:03:28,772 --> 01:03:29,239
Wait, you're the elf
on the news.

1405
01:03:30,574 --> 01:03:34,510
It's not my finest hour.

1406
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:35,879
[woman] Oh, that's her?

1407
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,581
Lance, I love you.

1408
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:42,919
And I'm sorry.

1409
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,620
I should not have done
what I did.

1410
01:03:44,621 --> 01:03:45,822
Please forgive me.

1411
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:49,826
You should go.

1412
01:03:52,997 --> 01:03:53,530
Can you at least
please come over tonight

1413
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:57,466
so we can talk?

1414
01:03:57,467 --> 01:03:58,402
It's important.

1415
01:04:00,404 --> 01:04:01,205
I'm not gonna go
until you agree.

1416
01:04:05,943 --> 01:04:09,479
Fine.

1417
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,015
But we are not
getting back together.

1418
01:04:12,016 --> 01:04:12,983
I'll come by
to pick up my things.

1419
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:14,919
Thank you.

1420
01:04:17,421 --> 01:04:18,488
Thank you.

1421
01:04:19,023 --> 01:04:20,190
Thank you.

1422
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:41,444
Debbie, hey!

1423
01:04:41,445 --> 01:04:43,247
Hi.

1424
01:04:44,114 --> 01:04:45,781
Look, I just wanna apologize.

1425
01:04:45,782 --> 01:04:47,616
It's a little late for that.

1426
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:49,018
No, no, no. Come on.

1427
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:50,653
You shouldn't have done
what you did,

1428
01:04:50,654 --> 01:04:51,521
but I was really wrong too.

1429
01:04:51,522 --> 01:04:53,257
[sighs]

1430
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,158
Look, I know

1431
01:04:55,159 --> 01:04:56,392
that you are
a generous philanthropist

1432
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:57,760
who donates a substantial
amount of money

1433
01:04:57,761 --> 01:04:59,795
to a lot of local charities.

1434
01:04:59,796 --> 01:05:01,397
That's supposed to be anonymous.

1435
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:03,866
[Krissy] Candy Cane Lane...

1436
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:05,201
I mean,
we'd just be an ordinary street

1437
01:05:05,202 --> 01:05:06,602
if it weren't for you.

1438
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:07,937
You can't leave.

1439
01:05:07,938 --> 01:05:10,239
[sighs]

1440
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,308
Do you know
where this tradition came from?

1441
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:13,510
During World War II,
wives and mothers

1442
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:19,048
would decorate a tree
as a beacon of hope

1443
01:05:19,049 --> 01:05:21,217
for their loved ones
who were away at war.

1444
01:05:21,218 --> 01:05:22,219
I didn't know that.

1445
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,388
My grandfather died
in World War II.

1446
01:05:25,889 --> 01:05:27,691
So this was my way to give back,

1447
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,961
a way for me to remember him.

1448
01:05:31,962 --> 01:05:33,063
I realize that I went too far.

1449
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:37,634
And I know that's no excuse,
but I meant no harm.

1450
01:05:39,903 --> 01:05:44,240
Believe me, I have been
doing a lot of that lately.

1451
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:47,210
Doesn't mean we can't fix
our mistakes, though, right?

1452
01:05:47,211 --> 01:05:49,013
Before you go,
come over for coffee.

1453
01:05:51,248 --> 01:05:53,050
Tomorrow, can we say,
like, three o'clock?

1454
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:55,185
I'll try.

1455
01:05:57,821 --> 01:05:58,655
Sounds like a yes.

1456
01:06:00,991 --> 01:06:02,226
Okay.

1457
01:06:05,329 --> 01:06:06,330
So you saw it, then?

1458
01:06:09,066 --> 01:06:09,666
It was
on the evening news, Krissy.

1459
01:06:11,268 --> 01:06:12,336
Everybody saw it.

1460
01:06:13,037 --> 01:06:14,004
Well, okay, to be fair,

1461
01:06:14,005 --> 01:06:15,339
after the whole
restaurant thing,

1462
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:18,241
I was pretty upset,
and it was the last straw.

1463
01:06:18,242 --> 01:06:21,777
I mean, I thought
you cheated on me.

1464
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:22,612
We were broken up, right?

1465
01:06:25,249 --> 01:06:26,050
I thought you were
with somebody else in New York.

1466
01:06:28,285 --> 01:06:29,253
Lance, there's never been
anybody else.

1467
01:06:31,288 --> 01:06:32,589
I know you're mad.

1468
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,493
And I would be too,
so it's totally understandable,

1469
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:39,096
but this isn't about me anymore.

1470
01:06:40,397 --> 01:06:41,397
I am really, really trying
to do the right thing

1471
01:06:41,398 --> 01:06:43,299
and help someone else out.

1472
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,833
And in order to do that,

1473
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,370
I need a good lawyer.

1474
01:06:47,204 --> 01:06:48,705
Go ahead. You have my attention.

1475
01:06:51,808 --> 01:06:53,143
Jill is conspiring
with a rival agency

1476
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:58,147
to take over Helen's company.

1477
01:06:58,148 --> 01:06:59,882
Everyone's gonna lose
their jobs.

1478
01:06:59,883 --> 01:07:01,118
And I respect Helen.

1479
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:04,487
You know,
she's a self-made woman.

1480
01:07:04,488 --> 01:07:05,921
She doesn't deserve that.

1481
01:07:05,922 --> 01:07:07,157
And you have proof?

1482
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:08,658
I did, and then I lost it.

1483
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,495
So if you can just do
a little bit of research

1484
01:07:12,496 --> 01:07:14,098
and find anything concrete,
I can take it from there.

1485
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,667
[sighs]

1486
01:07:22,339 --> 01:07:23,140
Lance, I'm really trying
to do the right thing, okay?

1487
01:07:23,141 --> 01:07:26,041
Honest.

1488
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:26,710
All right. I'll research it.

1489
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,248
Well, I mean, you're leaving?

1490
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:33,817
I thought maybe you could stay,

1491
01:07:35,018 --> 01:07:36,420
and we could work
on it together.

1492
01:07:37,221 --> 01:07:38,722
I can't concentrate here.

1493
01:07:39,156 --> 01:07:41,691
Oh.

1494
01:07:42,926 --> 01:07:44,260
Is it 'cause you still
find me irresistible?

1495
01:07:44,261 --> 01:07:45,695
Shouldn't you put
that sign up outside?

1496
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:49,166
I have plans for that sign.

1497
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:51,435
Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

1498
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,204
Good night, Krissy.

1499
01:07:54,638 --> 01:07:55,839
[sighs]

1500
01:08:02,946 --> 01:08:06,750
[doorbell rings]

1501
01:08:09,453 --> 01:08:14,022
Debbie.

1502
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:14,691
- Hi.
- Please, come in.

1503
01:08:15,992 --> 01:08:16,493
[Debbie]
Oh, why is everyone here?

1504
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,498
It's for you.

1505
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:24,500
We want you to know
how much we appreciate you

1506
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:25,735
and everything you do,
not only for our neighborhood,

1507
01:08:26,536 --> 01:08:28,537
but our entire community.

1508
01:08:28,538 --> 01:08:30,139
[applause]

1509
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:34,109
We didn't know that you helped

1510
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,478
build a rescue shelter
for animals.

1511
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:36,512
Or that you sponsored
our school's music program.

1512
01:08:36,513 --> 01:08:38,482
And lots of other charities

1513
01:08:39,483 --> 01:08:41,317
without receiving
any recognition.

1514
01:08:41,318 --> 01:08:43,652
Until now.

1515
01:08:43,653 --> 01:08:44,488
I... I don't know what to say.

1516
01:08:46,423 --> 01:08:47,424
Say you won't leave.

1517
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:49,493
You think any of us
wanna organize

1518
01:08:51,395 --> 01:08:51,695
the Easter egg hunt
or the Valentine's Day party?

1519
01:08:51,696 --> 01:08:54,830
[all laugh]

1520
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:56,665
I wish I could take back
what I did.

1521
01:08:56,666 --> 01:08:59,368
I'm so sorry.

1522
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:01,204
Oh, Debbie,
there's so much stuff

1523
01:09:01,205 --> 01:09:02,105
I wish that I could take back
recently.

1524
01:09:02,106 --> 01:09:05,341
But when you care about people,

1525
01:09:05,342 --> 01:09:07,243
you give them the benefit
of the doubt.

1526
01:09:07,244 --> 01:09:07,911
And because you always
take the time

1527
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:11,146
to make every holiday
so special,

1528
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,648
we all would like
to make your house

1529
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:15,117
the honorary holiday house.

1530
01:09:15,118 --> 01:09:15,785
Not just this year,
but every year.

1531
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,522
[applause]

1532
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:22,725
You know, this doesn't mean

1533
01:09:22,726 --> 01:09:24,193
that we're ending the
Christmas decorating contest.

1534
01:09:24,194 --> 01:09:25,529
Everyone here
still wants to beat you.

1535
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:27,264
- [man] That's right.
- Fair enough.

1536
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:31,133
Thank you all for seeing
the nicer side of me.

1537
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:33,370
Enough of the apologies.
Let's celebrate.

1538
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:37,941
[applause]

1539
01:09:42,212 --> 01:09:45,815
- Hey, there.
- Hi.

1540
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:47,551
Congratulations, Debbie.

1541
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:49,885
I hope this means
the hologram reindeer

1542
01:09:49,886 --> 01:09:50,554
will be back
in time for Christmas.

1543
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:52,921
Of course.

1544
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:53,557
I'll redecorate all night

1545
01:09:53,558 --> 01:09:55,391
if that's what it takes.

1546
01:09:55,392 --> 01:09:56,559
So looks like you were
on to something with Jill.

1547
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,962
I feel a "but" coming on.

1548
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:01,830
But there's no paper trail.

1549
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:04,700
Without a bank statement

1550
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:05,801
showing that she's on another
company's payroll,

1551
01:10:05,802 --> 01:10:07,936
we can't prove anything.

1552
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:09,438
What do you need
a bank statement for?

1553
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:10,873
Oh, my former co-worker
is trying to take down

1554
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:13,409
my old boss
at Purcell Advertising

1555
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:14,810
by poaching her clients
for a rival agency.

1556
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:17,680
What company?

1557
01:10:17,681 --> 01:10:19,214
Pogue and Price.

1558
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,383
They're an ad agency
and PR Firm.

1559
01:10:20,384 --> 01:10:21,318
I know them well.
We do their payroll.

1560
01:10:21,319 --> 01:10:22,986
Really?

1561
01:10:23,753 --> 01:10:25,354
So you could see

1562
01:10:25,355 --> 01:10:25,989
if Jill Rhodes
was working for them.

1563
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:29,492
I could definitely look into it.

1564
01:10:29,493 --> 01:10:31,126
Why don't you come by my office
tomorrow around 2:00?

1565
01:10:31,127 --> 01:10:32,629
I'll see what I can dig up.

1566
01:10:33,797 --> 01:10:34,631
Debbie, thank you.
Oh, thank you so much.

1567
01:10:35,632 --> 01:10:38,467
I'm not doing it
entirely for you.

1568
01:10:38,468 --> 01:10:39,603
I also happen
to know Helen Purcell,

1569
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:43,005
and she throws
this huge Christmas party

1570
01:10:43,006 --> 01:10:43,640
for underprivileged children
every year.

1571
01:10:44,474 --> 01:10:47,343
If she goes out of business,

1572
01:10:47,344 --> 01:10:48,044
a lot of kids will have
a miserable Christmas.

1573
01:10:48,045 --> 01:10:49,879
Wow.

1574
01:10:51,014 --> 01:10:52,415
I always thought
she was such an ice queen.

1575
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:53,883
Well, there are two sides
to every coin.

1576
01:10:54,718 --> 01:10:56,420
So I've learned. Thank you.

1577
01:10:57,787 --> 01:10:59,323
So...

1578
01:11:03,727 --> 01:11:05,227
Looks like you really
are doing the right thing.

1579
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:08,030
Well, I'm certainly trying.

1580
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,632
- Does this mean that we're...
- No.

1581
01:11:12,302 --> 01:11:14,036
You're still
on the naughty list.

1582
01:11:14,037 --> 01:11:16,340
[both chuckle]

1583
01:11:18,408 --> 01:11:18,875
I bet Debbie wins
best holiday office too.

1584
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:24,914
Where do you even buy
a fiber-optic Christmas tree?

1585
01:11:26,049 --> 01:11:27,417
Same place you get
a hologram reindeer.

1586
01:11:27,884 --> 01:11:30,420
Yeah.

1587
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:32,456
Well, Krissy,
you are absolutely right.

1588
01:11:32,457 --> 01:11:34,623
Turns out your friend Jill

1589
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:35,624
has been working
for Pogue and Price on the side

1590
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:36,926
for over a year now.

1591
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:38,928
And here is your paper trail.

1592
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:41,030
That's public information,

1593
01:11:43,099 --> 01:11:44,266
but if anyone asks,

1594
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:44,934
it just fell into your lap.

1595
01:11:45,769 --> 01:11:46,536
My name is never mentioned.

1596
01:11:46,537 --> 01:11:48,070
Absolutely.

1597
01:11:48,071 --> 01:11:48,838
This is exactly what we need.

1598
01:11:48,839 --> 01:11:51,039
Thank you.

1599
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,307
I gave a heads up
to some of our clients

1600
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,777
who might have been affected.

1601
01:11:54,778 --> 01:11:56,512
Really?

1602
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:57,414
[Debbie]
Well, they're gonna be looking

1603
01:11:57,415 --> 01:11:59,515
for an honest agency.

1604
01:11:59,516 --> 01:12:00,683
I told them I know
a bright advertising executive,

1605
01:12:00,684 --> 01:12:03,352
that we'd all be fools
not to give her our business.

1606
01:12:03,353 --> 01:12:05,021
Debbie,
I don't know what to say.

1607
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:09,925
Say "Merry Christmas."

1608
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:12,528
Merry Christmas.

1609
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:13,062
I'm really happy
we're still neighbors.

1610
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:16,099
Me too.

1611
01:12:18,768 --> 01:12:20,202
Now go and talk to Helen.

1612
01:12:20,203 --> 01:12:20,737
These companies don't wanna stay
in limbo for long.

1613
01:12:20,738 --> 01:12:22,472
Thank you, Anonymous.

1614
01:12:24,808 --> 01:12:25,475
So, um, how are you getting
to the party later?

1615
01:12:29,513 --> 01:12:31,814
'Cause I'm probably
gonna need a ride.

1616
01:12:31,815 --> 01:12:33,717
[sneezes]

1617
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:35,619
- [Krissy] Bless you.
- Oh, thanks, Krissy.

1618
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:36,720
Wait, Krissy?

1619
01:12:37,554 --> 01:12:38,422
The product appeals to parents,

1620
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:43,225
and they're the ones
with the pocketbooks,

1621
01:12:43,226 --> 01:12:45,260
so let's make sure
we take advantage of that.

1622
01:12:45,261 --> 01:12:46,129
Um, also we're hitting
both demographics with this.

1623
01:12:47,397 --> 01:12:49,999
Miss Kringle,
what are you doing here?

1624
01:12:51,034 --> 01:12:52,635
- I'm here to save your company.
- What?

1625
01:12:52,636 --> 01:12:55,137
This is my...

1626
01:12:55,138 --> 01:12:57,272
My attorney.

1627
01:12:57,273 --> 01:12:58,674
Mrs. Purcell,
with the help of Miss Kringle,

1628
01:12:58,675 --> 01:13:00,043
I have uncovered
some legal proof

1629
01:13:01,077 --> 01:13:02,645
that you have a mole
in your company.

1630
01:13:02,646 --> 01:13:03,146
This mole has been
selling key information

1631
01:13:04,448 --> 01:13:06,314
about your clients
to Pogue and Price

1632
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:07,983
and, as a result, picking off
your clients one by one.

1633
01:13:07,984 --> 01:13:10,619
- Who is this person?
- Helen, are you okay?

1634
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,589
I knew Krissy
would go postal one day.

1635
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,023
I just didn't think
she'd involve you, Lance.

1636
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:16,692
Speak of the devil.

1637
01:13:16,693 --> 01:13:18,561
If you take a look,

1638
01:13:18,562 --> 01:13:19,395
you'd see that
your employee Jill Rhodes

1639
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:20,396
is responsible for the leak.

1640
01:13:21,565 --> 01:13:22,865
She's on the payroll
at Pogue and Price.

1641
01:13:22,866 --> 01:13:23,767
If her scheme works,
she'll be made partner there.

1642
01:13:24,568 --> 01:13:26,469
Helen, this is all a lie.

1643
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:28,003
Krissy is severely delusional.

1644
01:13:28,004 --> 01:13:30,673
We've talked about this.

1645
01:13:30,674 --> 01:13:32,207
Delusional? No, no.

1646
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:33,241
Delusional is thinking
you can still shop

1647
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,544
in the juniors' section.

1648
01:13:35,545 --> 01:13:36,012
So did you finally
tell her about us?

1649
01:13:38,515 --> 01:13:40,849
What little there was
to remember.

1650
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:42,051
Enough.

1651
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:44,152
Miss Rhodes,

1652
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:44,921
these documents clearly show

1653
01:13:44,922 --> 01:13:46,421
that you've been collecting

1654
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:47,190
a secondary salary
for over a year.

1655
01:13:47,191 --> 01:13:49,357
Helen, she's psychotic.

1656
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:51,560
She's got
incriminating evidence.

1657
01:13:51,561 --> 01:13:53,196
So what?
Are you gonna release me?

1658
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:56,164
No.

1659
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:57,133
[chuckles]

1660
01:13:57,134 --> 01:13:58,567
I'm firing you.

1661
01:13:58,568 --> 01:13:59,736
Security?

1662
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:03,438
Please have Jill Rhodes

1663
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:04,673
escorted out of the office
at once.

1664
01:14:04,674 --> 01:14:05,809
Fine, do this.
I'll take everything.

1665
01:14:06,643 --> 01:14:08,545
It's not like I haven't already.

1666
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:10,646
That's not true.

1667
01:14:10,647 --> 01:14:11,914
I actually
have verbal commitments

1668
01:14:11,915 --> 01:14:13,949
from all
of these business owners

1669
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:14,784
who are eager to start accounts
with your firm, if...

1670
01:14:14,785 --> 01:14:16,119
If you work here?

1671
01:14:18,021 --> 01:14:19,122
You can't do this.

1672
01:14:22,325 --> 01:14:23,726
I hope you have a good attorney!

1673
01:14:23,727 --> 01:14:25,528
Don't worry. I do.

1674
01:14:25,529 --> 01:14:26,562
- [guard] Let's go.
- Let go of me!

1675
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:27,564
Thank you, Miss Kringle.

1676
01:14:28,498 --> 01:14:29,833
And welcome back.

1677
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:32,802
Well, before I come back in
from the wild,

1678
01:14:32,803 --> 01:14:35,838
I have just a few requests.

1679
01:14:35,839 --> 01:14:37,574
I'd like an office.

1680
01:14:39,843 --> 01:14:41,610
And a parking space.

1681
01:14:41,611 --> 01:14:43,579
And a 20% raise.

1682
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:46,214
[chuckles]

1683
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:47,150
I was wrong
to assume the worst, Krissy.

1684
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:51,253
You're very talented
and an asset to this company.

1685
01:14:51,254 --> 01:14:52,889
I agree to your terms,
with one exception.

1686
01:14:53,723 --> 01:14:56,092
The job comes with a 30% raise.

1687
01:14:58,027 --> 01:14:59,195
I think I can live with that.

1688
01:15:01,064 --> 01:15:02,064
[Philip retches]

1689
01:15:02,065 --> 01:15:03,699
[coughs]

1690
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:06,636
I'm sorry.

1691
01:15:07,704 --> 01:15:08,171
I know this might not be
the best time,

1692
01:15:09,606 --> 01:15:10,639
but, Mrs. Purcell, I don't think
I can play Santa Claus tonight.

1693
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,809
[Philip coughs]

1694
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:14,877
Okay, Philip. It...

1695
01:15:14,878 --> 01:15:15,911
Just go drink some tea.

1696
01:15:15,912 --> 01:15:17,646
[coughs]

1697
01:15:17,647 --> 01:15:19,047
Thank you.

1698
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:20,649
[Philip coughs]

1699
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:21,250
[Krissy] You know,
I think I can help.

1700
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,854
Um, I know
about the charity work you do

1701
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:27,156
and the party you throw
for the underprivileged kids,

1702
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:31,894
so if you can just get them here
at this time,

1703
01:15:31,895 --> 01:15:33,697
I can schedule
a private meeting with Santa.

1704
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,199
Are you serious?

1705
01:15:38,902 --> 01:15:39,869
You know Santa Claus?

1706
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:42,238
I'm a Kringle.

1707
01:15:43,673 --> 01:15:44,841
[chuckles]

1708
01:15:46,743 --> 01:15:51,113
[kids screaming]

1709
01:15:51,114 --> 01:15:53,950
Hi! Come on!

1710
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:57,920
Hi, guys!

1711
01:15:57,921 --> 01:15:59,588
- [Marco] Hey, guys.
- Welcome to Santa's workshop!

1712
01:15:59,589 --> 01:16:00,556
We're so excited
you guys are here, right?

1713
01:16:01,124 --> 01:16:04,026
Absolutely.

1714
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:05,560
We have a really big night
planned for you guys.

1715
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,863
Santa Claus is coming
all the way from the North Pole

1716
01:16:07,864 --> 01:16:11,199
just to see you guys.

1717
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,768
Are you ready?

1718
01:16:12,769 --> 01:16:13,802
- [kids] Yeah!
- [Krissy] Yeah? Good!

1719
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:14,803
'Cause Santa Claus
is coming to town tonight.

1720
01:16:14,804 --> 01:16:16,706
[kids] Yeah!

1721
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,506
And I think I see him.

1722
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:22,344
Ho, ho, ho!

1723
01:16:22,345 --> 01:16:23,812
[kids] Yeah!

1724
01:16:23,813 --> 01:16:27,449
Merry Christmas.

1725
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:29,785
This guy's pretty good.

1726
01:16:29,786 --> 01:16:31,053
Have you all been
very, very good?

1727
01:16:31,054 --> 01:16:32,689
[kids] Yes!

1728
01:16:33,556 --> 01:16:35,457
Well, let me sit down and see.

1729
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:38,126

Hey.

1756
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:40,356
Justin, that fits really nice.

1757
01:17:40,357 --> 01:17:43,026
Yeah, not bad, huh?

1758
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:44,527
It's more comfortable
than I would have thought.

1759
01:17:44,528 --> 01:17:46,029
Right?

1760
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:47,931
Thank you so much
for making all of this happen.

1761
01:17:47,932 --> 01:17:49,332
It turned out really amazing.

1762
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,700
No worries, mate.

1763
01:17:51,701 --> 01:17:53,068
[laughs]

1764
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:54,870
I'm glad I could help.

1765
01:17:54,871 --> 01:17:57,172
Hey, make sure
you tell Grams, okay?

1766
01:17:57,173 --> 01:18:00,275
Yeah.

1767
01:18:00,276 --> 01:18:01,443
Oh.

1768
01:18:01,444 --> 01:18:03,079
Merry Christmas.

1769
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,380
You too.

1770
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:06,049
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

1771
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:07,817
All right. Come on out this way.

1772
01:18:08,885 --> 01:18:10,086
Can we all say
thank you to Santa?

1773
01:18:11,487 --> 01:18:12,520
- [kids] Thank you, Santa!
- [Marco] Thank you, Santa!

1774
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:15,457
And you're very welcome.

1775
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:16,826
Merry Christmas to you all.

1776
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:20,796
You continue to be good,

1777
01:18:20,797 --> 01:18:23,198
and all your dreams
will come true.

1778
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,334
All right, Santa's got
a lot of work to do tonight,

1779
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:29,171
so say thank you again.

1780
01:18:29,172 --> 01:18:30,806
Bye, Santa!

1781
01:18:30,807 --> 01:18:31,207
- [kids] Bye, Santa!
- [Marco] Bye, Santa!

1782
01:18:32,575 --> 01:18:33,442
Oh, this is very kind.

1783
01:18:36,813 --> 01:18:40,482
Thank you.

1784
01:18:40,483 --> 01:18:41,017
It's Christmas.
That's what it's about, right?

1785
01:18:41,018 --> 01:18:43,486
Merry Christmas to you.

1786
01:18:44,854 --> 01:18:45,789
I hope Santa brings you
something very special.

1787
01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:47,356
Oh, he already has.

1788
01:18:47,791 --> 01:18:49,125
Thanks.

1789
01:18:49,926 --> 01:18:50,993
Can we all say thank you?

1790
01:18:50,994 --> 01:18:52,660
[kids] Thank you.

1791
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:53,329
Oh, I'm so glad. Bye, guys!

1792
01:18:58,601 --> 01:19:02,371
[Marco groans]

1793
01:19:02,906 --> 01:19:04,606
[chuckles]

1794
01:19:04,607 --> 01:19:05,374
This has been a great holiday.

1795
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:08,310
I'm glad you came to work here,
Krissy Kringle.

1796
01:19:08,311 --> 01:19:09,744
Marco, I wouldn't have
survived it without you.

1797
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,380
Oh, please, I loved the drama.

1798
01:19:12,215 --> 01:19:13,116
I was glad to be part of it.

1799
01:19:14,183 --> 01:19:16,684
Did you get to ask Santa
for anything?

1800
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:17,386
I just want off
the naughty list.

1801
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:19,122
[both chuckle]

1802
01:19:20,389 --> 01:19:21,224
I think you did that
without Santa, all right?

1803
01:19:21,225 --> 01:19:24,626
Merry Christmas.

1804
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:26,661
- You too.
- All right.

1805
01:19:26,662 --> 01:19:27,463
Hey, let me help you clean up.

1806
01:19:29,532 --> 01:19:30,532
No, no, no, no.
I'll do it in the morning.

1807
01:19:30,533 --> 01:19:32,435
It's my gift to you.

1808
01:19:32,869 --> 01:19:34,904
Thanks.

1809
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:36,638
All right.

1810
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:37,506
- Good night.
- Bye.

1811
01:19:37,507 --> 01:19:38,908
[chuckles]

1812
01:19:41,477 --> 01:19:45,414
Merry Christmas to all,
and to all a good night.

1813
01:19:46,215 --> 01:19:49,853
Bye.

1814
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:56,425
[sighs]

1815
01:20:02,932 --> 01:20:06,569
[tinkling]

1816
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:09,405
I love Christmas lights.

1817
01:20:11,908 --> 01:20:14,609
I do.

1818
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:15,544
[Santa laughs]

1819
01:20:15,545 --> 01:20:16,744
Did you know

1820
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:18,013
that, before electricity,

1821
01:20:18,014 --> 01:20:19,214
they used to light trees
with candles?

1822
01:20:19,215 --> 01:20:21,584
That sounds like a fire hazard.

1823
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:24,386
Oh, it was.

1824
01:20:24,387 --> 01:20:25,988
That's why I made sure
that little Tommy Edison

1825
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:28,924
had everything he needed
in his science kit.

1826
01:20:28,925 --> 01:20:31,460
[chuckles]

1827
01:20:32,528 --> 01:20:33,595
This red suit
is flammable, you know.

1828
01:20:33,596 --> 01:20:34,964
Do you need a ride or anything?

1829
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:39,367
Oh, well, no, I...

1830
01:20:39,368 --> 01:20:42,871
I have a ride.

1831
01:20:42,872 --> 01:20:43,372
I came back for my book,
Krissy Kringle.

1832
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:47,944
[tinkling]

1833
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:50,479
Wait, are you...

1834
01:20:52,648 --> 01:20:53,582
No, no, I'm sorry.
That's... That's impossible.

1835
01:20:53,583 --> 01:20:56,751
That's for you to decide.

1836
01:20:56,752 --> 01:20:57,954
It's a magical time of year.

1837
01:21:01,024 --> 01:21:03,226
And you helped
prove that tonight,

1838
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:05,894
right here with these kids.

1839
01:21:05,895 --> 01:21:07,130
Alas, I must have my book now.

1840
01:21:12,401 --> 01:21:16,438
Um...

1841
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:17,506
Thanks.

1842
01:21:20,243 --> 01:21:21,244
You can let go now.

1843
01:21:22,946 --> 01:21:23,947
I'm sorry. I ruined it.

1844
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:27,149
Oh, no.
You haven't ruined anything.

1845
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:29,417
I've had many cocoa spills
over the years myself.

1846
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:32,921
[both chuckle]

1847
01:21:32,922 --> 01:21:33,489
And I knew
you would work things out,

1848
01:21:33,490 --> 01:21:36,324
even without it.

1849
01:21:36,325 --> 01:21:37,325
Wait, did you send it to me?

1850
01:21:37,326 --> 01:21:39,527
Oh, no.

1851
01:21:39,528 --> 01:21:40,862
I just let you have it
for a while.

1852
01:21:40,863 --> 01:21:42,898
What did you say you wanted
for Christmas this year?

1853
01:21:44,033 --> 01:21:46,334
I wanted a new last name.
No offense.

1854
01:21:46,335 --> 01:21:49,038
Oh.

1855
01:21:50,073 --> 01:21:52,374
I believe the last thing
on your list

1856
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:53,676
was to be recognized
for your hard work and talent

1857
01:21:55,011 --> 01:21:59,547
and to be happy.

1858
01:21:59,548 --> 01:22:00,316
That sounds familiar.

1859
01:22:01,985 --> 01:22:03,285
And were you recognized?

1860
01:22:03,286 --> 01:22:04,653
Yeah.

1861
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:08,590
And are you happy?

1862
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:09,558
I'm getting there.

1863
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:15,063
Everyone makes mistakes.

1864
01:22:15,064 --> 01:22:15,798
It's how we respond to them
that matters.

1865
01:22:15,799 --> 01:22:20,302
Follow your heart,

1866
01:22:20,303 --> 01:22:21,070
and you'll always see
the nice side of others first.

1867
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,140
Thank you, Santa.

1868
01:22:25,908 --> 01:22:27,043
[Santa chuckles]

1869
01:22:29,412 --> 01:22:30,579
Merry Christmas, Krissy Kringle.

1870
01:22:32,715 --> 01:22:33,716
[Krissy chuckles]

1871
01:22:34,717 --> 01:22:35,418
And to you, a good night.

1872

1873
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:39,622

[Krissy chuckles]

1875
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:10,119
Hi.

1876
01:23:10,553 --> 01:23:11,620
Hi.

1877
01:23:13,522 --> 01:23:14,090
I came here
because I wanted to tell you

1878
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,627
I accept your apology.

1879
01:23:19,628 --> 01:23:20,263
So does this mean
you're my boyfriend again?

1880
01:23:22,531 --> 01:23:24,233
No.

1881
01:23:26,969 --> 01:23:27,636
I don't wanna be your boyfriend.

1882
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:31,006
Okay.

1883
01:23:33,942 --> 01:23:35,078
I mean, I...

1884
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:36,645
I understand.

1885
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:38,347
[chuckles]

1886
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:41,350
I wanna be your husband.

1887
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,389
[Krissy chuckles]

1888
01:23:47,223 --> 01:23:48,391
I've waited six years for this,

1889
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:51,226
since the moment
I first laid eyes on you.

1890
01:23:51,227 --> 01:23:52,728
Krissy Kringle,
will you be my wife?

1891
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,365
Is that a yes?

1892
01:23:59,635 --> 01:24:00,536
Uh-huh, it is.

1893
01:24:03,239 --> 01:24:06,775
[Krissy chuckles]

1894
01:24:12,014 --> 01:24:16,418
[Krissy chuckles]

1895
01:24:16,419 --> 01:24:17,552
I love you so much.

1896
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:19,020
I love you.

1897
01:24:19,021 --> 01:24:20,123
[both chuckle]

1898
01:24:25,294 --> 01:24:30,265
What did you do?

1899
01:24:30,266 --> 01:24:31,100
I didn't think you were
ever gonna get to "yes."

1900
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:36,070
[applause]

1901
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:37,472
Mom.

1902
01:24:37,473 --> 01:24:38,341
Okay, let me see that ring.

1903
01:24:39,642 --> 01:24:41,809
[gasps]

1904
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:42,611
Welcome to the family,
officially.

1905
01:24:42,612 --> 01:24:45,280
Thank you.

1906
01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:46,814
- Congratulations, Krissy.
- Thank you so much.

1907
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:49,184
- Hi.
- [Brenda] I'm so happy for you.

1908
01:24:49,185 --> 01:24:50,952
How did you guys
know about this?

1909
01:24:50,953 --> 01:24:52,954
[Brenda] We're so happy for you.

1910
01:24:52,955 --> 01:24:54,757
Marco, what are you doing here?

1911
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:57,925
Well, maybe there is a
little magic this time of year.

1912
01:24:57,926 --> 01:24:59,461
- Oh, buddy, thank you.
- [Marco] Come here.

1913
01:24:59,462 --> 01:25:00,995
Hi.

1914
01:25:00,996 --> 01:25:01,764
- This is Lance.
- Lance.

1915
01:25:02,865 --> 01:25:03,998
- Well done, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

1916
01:25:03,999 --> 01:25:06,401
Oh, honey, it's beautiful.

1917
01:25:06,402 --> 01:25:08,670
So that's why
I've been working so hard.

1918
01:25:08,671 --> 01:25:10,305
[sighs]

1919
01:25:10,306 --> 01:25:11,474
I love it.

1920
01:25:13,075 --> 01:25:14,009
I hope it's exactly
what you wanted.

1921
01:25:14,010 --> 01:25:15,377
You are all I ever wanted.

1922
01:25:15,378 --> 01:25:16,812
Well, that, and my last name.

1923
01:25:18,881 --> 01:25:21,449
Yeah, about that, um,

1924
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:22,485
I was thinking maybe
I would keep my name

1925
01:25:23,219 --> 01:25:24,952
and just hyphenate it.

1926
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,053
Hmm. Krissy Kringle-Leigh.

1927
01:25:26,054 --> 01:25:28,823
[chuckles]

1928
01:25:28,824 --> 01:25:29,991
It has a nice ring to it.

1929
01:25:29,992 --> 01:25:30,559
- I like it.
- I like you.

1930

[wind blows]

1931
01:25:38,234 --> 01:25:39,735
- [man] Holy...
- [woman] Oh, my God.

1932
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:48,777
Debbie, you didn't get
a snow machine, did you?

1933
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:51,514
I had nothing to do with this.

1934
01:25:52,448 --> 01:25:54,149
- I don't believe it.
- I do.

1935
01:25:55,284 --> 01:25:56,519
- This is wonderful!
- This is perfect.

1936
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:00,155
Oh!

1937
01:26:01,724 --> 01:26:03,226
It's beautiful.
