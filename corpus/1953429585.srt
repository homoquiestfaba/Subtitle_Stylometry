1
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,380
- Would you try your semen?
- Not intentionally.

2
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,690
- But would you?
- Yes, maybe I have.

3
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,380
- Perhaps?
- If, as I was towards the straw.

4
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,170
- You will?
- I do not always wash after...

5
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,500
for me the straw, depending on what
going to do, if I go to...

6
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,080
my grandparents if
but if I'm sitting in the...

7
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,600
dining table,
probably not...

8
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,470
and it depends as
get my hands on.

9
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,550
- You know.
- The 3rd is my turn. You still are on the 1st?

10
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,900
We are in
conversation.

11
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,400
- Must be very intellectual.
- Fuck.

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,040
John, I can ask what
is your darkest fantasy.

13
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,580
- This should be good.
- I've never told this to anyone.

14
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,850
but I think a lot
it would be very hot...

15
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:16,030
if a girl had a
deformity of two vaginas.

16
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,060
- Shit.
- How does it work?

17
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,340
I'm not sure I'm not a
expert in anatomy, but ..

18
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,310
is a good idea, I have
to give credit for that.

19
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,990
I think so, but not
I imagine in my head.

20
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,980
Any above the other,
from side to side, or horizontal?

21
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,765
Horizontal, as a
china vagina?, horrible.

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,370
I did not say vagina china.
're Putting words in my mouth.

23
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,110
I'll put my penis your mouth one soon.

24
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,750
There may be one above the other
it would be a huge vagina.

25
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,570
- That is good but not what we want.
- A side by side.

26
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,510
If we are not going to elaborate.

27
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,210
- The image is what matters...
- Ah, she's unconscious.

28
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,320
- Fuck.
- Very funny.

29
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,960
Very relaxed you are with this girl
you take off your pants, panties.

30
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:06,620
And "bam!" double action
Double your fun.

31
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,110
Those are rare things
"Total Recall" on TV.

32
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,750
- As the girl with three boobs
- She was hot.

33
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,240
Three tits is hot but
two vaginas is warmer.

34
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,255
Yes, but you will need 2
penises to enjoy it.

35
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:23,110
- You have the hands and feet.
- She can fuck with two in one.

36
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,355
No, find yours, this is mine.

37
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,040
- And what about the rule, two periods.
- I thought of that, periods

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,790
Periods ranging from one
the other vagina vagina.

39
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,840
So when this des-ovulating
the other is ready to "Rock N Roll."

40
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,580
You know what a period
is when the uterus...

41
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,730
Enough with the terms
clinicians this is a fantasy.

42
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,800
- Exactly.
- And in this world, no periods.

43
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,620
A fucking love that.

44
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,860

- Living with April, have you seen naked?
- Eg...

176
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,530
Maybe.

177
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,520
Some action last night, did you just
sat there drooling?

178
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,180
Let's say I had doubled.

179
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,480
- Menage Trois?
- No second base.

180
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,590
- With whom?
- This girl.

181
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,440
- Do not know.
- Taste.

182
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,400
Yes, what is your name?
Or you're just lying.

183
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,990
I do not know your fucking name,
had people next to me...

184
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,830
they were kissing and this
girl was unconscious.

185
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,480
You're pathetic.

186
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,240
Boobs touched many last night
great guy. Exactly.

187
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:20,090
If I did not make love to conjoined twins
before the age of 30 commit suicide.

188
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,510
What the hell are you looking.

189
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,670
- It's research.
- From the Cuban Missile Crisis.

190
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,750
No, it's more interesting than that.

191
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,230
What the hell is that?

192
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,610
Hear of the "Glory Holes."

193
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,980
We are not all perverts like you.

194
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,140
Colin you know what
a glory hole, right?.

195
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,170
- Maybe.
- Again, Colin is also perverted.

196
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,980
- What is it?
- A small hole in the dying and someone sticks his penis.

197
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,160
and across someone masturbates.

198
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,620
- Anyone?
- A hot girl.

199
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,760
Not always.

200
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,000
And this happens where?

201
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,440
Everywhere.

202
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,750
- I do not know how common it is.
- This is fiction pornography.

203
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:04,340
You are so brainwashed with this
shit and have lost touch with reality.

204
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,760
Whatever.

205
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,200
- Where is Caroline?
- Do not know.

206
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,580
I do not think she is lost
examinations.

207
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:27,150
- Try this with her boyfriend.
- Do you think that at least is real?

208
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,030
Why a college man
I would like something with it?

209
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,150
Yes, I know she has been
out to 6 months.

210
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,360
And have not seen it even once.

211
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:41,390
Suspect that if she was
invited to the party last night but did not come.

212
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,270
I heard you spent good
times at this event.

213
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,130
What?

214
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,400
Everyone is talking about it.

215
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,760
Should it?

216
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,570
Attention students

217
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,660
Due to numerous complaints from parents
the upcoming production of "Vagina Monologues"

218
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,500
has been postponed indefinitely.

219
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,610
Remember to vote next week
whether it will be replaced by "Cat's"

220
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,110
or "A girl like you"

221
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,890
- What will you do now?
- Nothing.

222
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,240
- Would you hang around?
- Your sister is very good.

223
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,760
- My house or yours?
- Yours.

224
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,110
Pizza.

225
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,750
Large pepperoni pizza.

226
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,420
Is this your sister?

227
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,520
- Do not know.
- I ordered a cheese...

228
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,850
Okay, the pepperoni is free...

229
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,340
I have to go to the bathroom.

230
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,500
It's really a great pepperoni.

231
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,060
Have you heard of the "Glory Hole"?

232
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,890
It is a small hole in the wall
where the man puts his penis...

233
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,410
... And someone on the other side sucks.

234
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,620
Good girl.

235
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,520
How nice it looked Mr. Kimble

236
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,230
He is so old. Is 32.

237
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,160
Whatever.

238
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,050
- Reminds me of AC Slater.
- What?!

239
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,200
- If it is someone is Screech.
- No way.

240
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,930
I like men who are a bit...

241
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,660
What?

242
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,150
I like...

243
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,800
- I like Tyler.
- Tyler is hot.

244
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,240
Hot?!

245
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,810
- Hello Mr. Kimble.
- Call me John or Jonathan.

246
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,570
- Good to see you again Dr. Jordan.
- Please call me Mike.

247
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,740
Do you?

248
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:56,130
My wife tells me that the dye
food causes cancer in rats.

249
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,000
Who knows it.

250
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,350
I just came to see if everything
is fine and comfortable...

251
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,500
Yes, good kids.
In fact your daughter Michelle...

252
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,620
- It's in my chemistry class.
- And she does not stop talking about you.

253
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,520
He says you do great things
with the Bunsen burner.

254
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:20,580
Speaking of lighter, I'll have
a barbecue tomorrow night

255
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,490
I would like you to come and share.

256
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,950
- Yes?
- Yes.

257
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,530
I think it would be a good opportunity
for you to meet other teachers.

258
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,430
As you are new to the area.

259
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,650
- I love barbecue.
- Who does not like?.

260
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,660
I'm buying a box
Tofu Dogs whole.

261
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,500
Some veggie burgers...

262
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,960
And Frank's English department,
the account of the funniest stories.

263
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,330
"I can count on you?

264
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,780
- Of course.
- Good!

265
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,750
I knew you'd want John!

266
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,400
Jonathan.

267
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,390
Science!

268
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,210
Winters appeal to make, no
We answer the phone now...

269
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,930
but leave a message
and we will contact.

270
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,480
Hello April and Colin, I hope
having a nice day

271
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,420
I will work late tonight
Dad is in town.

272
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,100
be alone for dinner tonight.

273
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:33,110
To order whatever they want with the credit card.
I hope to be at 9:00.

274
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,430
I love them.

275
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:40,650
- What happened last night?
- That one I met with some people.

276
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:45,060
- April.
- Do not know if it sounds strange, but still a virgin.

277
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,750
So what happened?

278
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,780
I just collect.

279
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,330
- What does that mean?
- Not all are prudish Michelle.

280
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,870
Just because all have not done much,
does not mean that everyone is like you.

281
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,330
Well, I feel like
I'm losing.

282
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,780
You have so much attention.
Everyone knows who you are.

283
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:06,060
You're not a prude...

284
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,270
Just go to the next level.

285
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,610
What, is easy and fun.
And they love it.

286
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,810
I love that kind of control.

287
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,530
- You bitch again.
- No big deal.

288
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,750
It's like shaking hands, but
Instead of using the hand you use your mouth.

289
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,380
- And instead of the hand of another...
- I got it.

290
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,130
You like that, right?

291
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,880
What, do you want to do
singa harder?

292
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,620
I know I can endure,
I do not know if you can.

293
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,110
Wait.

294
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,420
Fuck.

295
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,120
I'm not interrupting anything?

296
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,560
I was... sleeping.

297
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,990
- Is your box of condoms in the bathroom?
- What?

298
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,190
They are not mine, and I'm pretty sure
Dad had a vasectomy.

299
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:24,230
- What Mom is not here?
- Do not know.

300
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,400
- With whom you are gathering.
- Do not worry.

301
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,020
- What the hell were you doing at that party last night?
- Jesus, you too?

302
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,370
Everyone talked about today.

303
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,110
Personally I do not
matter what you do.

304
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:40,900
But if foxes to the point that I can not
continue my day without hearing that shit.

305
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,700
I think things went too far.

306
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,420
Rumors out of proportion.

307
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,270
Funny.

308
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,310
What I heard is that your
mouth out of proportion.

309
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,230
I'm not a slut.

310
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,440
I'm just popular, you understand.

311
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:57,150
I'm not the one that leaves a box
open condom in the bathroom.

312
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,230
Honestly, not who you to talk.

313
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,310
Wednesday

314
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,440
- Shit.
- Friend.

315
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,830
What man?

316
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,140
I have to tell you, you had the
right about the "Glory Hole"

317
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,770
What?

318
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,220
It was Colin's house because
wanted to see if it was true in April.

319
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,480
You're not alone.

320
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:42,620
Yes, but not easily understood what was in
party until I wanted to see for myself.

321
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,900
All right.

322
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,850
I went to the bathroom and were renovating the bathroom.

323
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,950
And there was this hole in the wall
that was the fourth of April.

324
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,620
Dude, tell me you got involved
penis through that hole.

325
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,450
Volume 2 minutes but finally.

326
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,230
By God, you suck the April
penis for the "Glory Hole"

327
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,080
- That was what was missing.
- It was so good.

328
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,470
- I have to go more to Colin's house.
- Honestly.

329
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:09,700
Caroline was watching me.

330
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,010
- It was not.
- What if.

331
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,600
- Hey, where were you yesterday?
- I was not feeling well.

332
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,630
- What is that?
- Does all what?

333
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,720
Your attitude, you're acting
like a bitch.

334
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,080
- What happened?
- What?

335
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,800
I've heard of the party.

336
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,100
- You must be joking.
- I heard you tie with Tyler yesterday.

337
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,650
- I do not know what you mean.
- I do not care

338
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:43,390
- I do not know when you became a whore.
- That offends me.

339
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,590
Hi, what happens?

340
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,190
- Nothing.
- Yes.

341
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,700
I think I will invite
Tyler this weekend.

342
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:54,390
- If he has no plans to April.
- What?

343
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,030
What do you mean?

344
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,820
No Michelle, Caroline thought
hear something that is not true.

345
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,200
What?

346
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:06,800
- What is it?
- Never mind, I promise not to pass.

347
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,750
I heard this morning saying Tyler
that was with April yesterday.

348
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,740
April!

349
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,340
- I told you no way.
- I know what I heard.

350
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,670
That is a lie.

351
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:24,130
It is not enough to have the person you want,
have to pursue the only guy I like.

352
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,560
He is not alone.

353
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,900
And what of Mr. Kimble?

354
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,000
Michelle.

355
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,680
Finally you get to work.

356
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,160
That I'm trying.

357
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,150
And him? The Missile Crisis in Cuba.

358
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,240
- I doubt it.
- What got you so interested?

359
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:56,440
Eh... I'm watching something online fascinating.

360
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,490
Have you heard of "Seagull"

361
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,530
- "Seagulls?"
- No.

362
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,620
- And they call men.
- I never said that.

363
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,550
- What is "Seagull"?
- I knew you were interested.

364
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:13,460
- What is it?
- Those familiar with the "Bukkake."

365
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,720
What is that?

366
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,270
Let's say it is a
art form of Japanese.

367
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,350
Oh, and you call yourself religious.

368
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,810
Not really.

369
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:27,570
It's like "Bukkake"
with a small difference.

370
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:30,580
The recipients do not agree.

371
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,760
- Ok, I think I understand.
- What is it, I'm lost.

372
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:39,230
Basically you have to know when
and where two people are going to have sex.

373
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,690
Then go ahead to hide
so that they can not see you.

374
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:50,040
They come in and start doing
and you begin to get a straw.

375
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,610
- Is that all?
- It gets better.

376
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,990
They come in and start the
sex, you're making it a straw.

377
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:59,410
And just before they are
to end your sales of hiding...

378
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,160
and ejaculate over them.

379
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,790
Flapping your hands and
screaming like a "Seagull."

380
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,580
Would you mind?!

381
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:15,500
What the fuck, no
So that is real.

382
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:18,160
It is, accept it!

383
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,630
- That's great.
- Both are sick.

384
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,850
Because we're making
a new and exciting sex.

385
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,670
Me too, but I think if you
given more time to girls

386
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:34,070
to read that shit, you'd
with more opportunities.

387
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,680
I told you what happened the other
night, second base.

388
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:43,270
- John, I do not think that counts.
- I think it has to be awake.

389
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,310
Whatever.

390
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,850
Love, love you so much.

391
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,410
You will, I'm so tired
with all of my age.

392
00:30:55,490 --> 00:31:01,580
They are so immature, and I like to have a
relationship without all the drama of high school.

393
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:02,770
Yes?

394
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,200
Wait, I just
think of something.

395
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,530
You'll love this.

396
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,730
- Ryan.
- What?

397
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,130
What are you doing?

398
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,570
I want to record you,
going to be hot.

399
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,190
- What if someone sees?
- No one will see.

400
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,190
Trust me.

401
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,870
I love you.

402
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,180
- Really?
- Claro.

403
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,920
If this is done.

404
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,900
You're hot.

405
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,580
I love you too.

406
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:11,470
- Hello Mr. Kimble.
- Hi Michelle.

407
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,900
What brings you here?

408
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:17,490
I was a bit confused by...

409
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,480
the book's problems Thermo-Chemistry.

410
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:23,100
Just do not want to stay behind.

411
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:26,170
I do not think you're going to stay behind,

412
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,890
scores have a
highest in class.

413
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,430
Better safe, to forgive.

414
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:37,200
You can wait a few minutes
I will finish correcting.

415
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,670
Sure, you wait all day.

416
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,050
Are you okay?

417
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,340
Ok, this is embarrassing

418
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,070
my stupid thong, sorry.
Who cares...

419
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,540
Michelle.

420
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,680
- Much better.
- No. .. I do not think.

421
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,000
Usually I do not wear tights,
I do not know what he was thinking.

422
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,640
Hey John I was thinking...
Oh, Michelle...

423
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,460
're Here for a class.

424
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,100
- Mr. Kimball was...
- Teaching...

425
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,450
the, the, the... facts...

426
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,800
That will be in the next review
and you know what happens is that Michelle...

427
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,130
is ahead of others in class.

428
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:51,890
The exam is not until next
week, but she is ready.

429
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,470
That's my daughter.

430
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,170
What about Mike?

431
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:00,470
Do not want to interrupt, wanted to make sure
would come to the barbecue tonight.

432
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,480
I'm going to barbecue, Mike.

433
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,655
Good, good!

434
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:09,010
See you tonight love
and let them return to their...

435
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,790
Quantum entanglement.

436
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:16,010
Quantum entanglement,
I loved that show.

437
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,880
Have fun.

438
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,890
"Quantum entanglement?
I do not know what you.

439
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,220
- Not what you know.
- Do you find me beautiful?

440
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,110
Wait a second.
Please wait.

441
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,920
- Did not you going to do?.
- I do not see a ring.

442
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:36,680
- I'm your teacher.
- And?

443
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,840
And you have 16 years.

444
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,040
- Not until within 2 weeks.
- Oh... my god.

445
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,140
Have any idea of the problem
that I would get if... if...

446
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:52,300
Stop. I can lose my
work or even go to jail.

447
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:55,640
You're going to stop this now, okay?.

448
00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:00,060
I want you to go outside
here, see you tomorrow. Now!

449
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,460
I think it will tonight.

450
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,840
Learn something of dignity today.

451
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,910
Good day.

452
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:35,250
Never want to be away
you, I love you so.

453
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:45,910
My friends are now.
Please excuse me.

454
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,930
That's it.

455
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,420
I have things to do.

456
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,790
Just want to be me
when we have sex...

457
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:01,120
when that is finished and want to go.
It's like I want.

458
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:03,530
And I thought you would not do that to me.

459
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,280
- Caroline.
- I love you Ryan.

460
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,380
I know, but I have social plans.

461
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,520
Do you understand?

462
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,590
And this is all organic, costs
a little more expensive but worth it.

463
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,140
- Nice day is not
- Yes.

464
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,620
Toma, Cauliflower.

465
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:49,110
Michelle would love
teach her room, listen.

466
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,210
I have to go to the bathroom,
Are you in?

467
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:57,990
Here, in right.
The house.

468
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,890
I have nothing to
I do better just a. ..

469
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:05,470
No, my wife would kill me.
Use the toilet boss.

470
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:11,210
I will wait until
I go home,

471
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,860
I have something funny to use...

472
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,920
are things, things about me...

473
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,660
If it did not tell you, I have to applaud...

474
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,160
're doing a job
phenomenal from what I hear...

475
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:31,540
your schools are happy.
Your students are...

476
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,470
You know, I have to go, I have
toileting. Truth here.

477
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:37,510
Oh yeah, for right there on the right.

478
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,700
Dame over the cauliflower.

479
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,250
Food for the brain.

480
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,200
- What are you doing.
- Do not speak so high if I were you.

481
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,100
We do not want
someone finds us.

482
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:08,250
Michelle, I thought I
clear. I can not do this.

483
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:11,600
I can not do this,
please forgive me.

484
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,200
- Right now.
- You're in no position to tell me to do.

485
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:20,030
Please Michelle, not me
take off my shirt and do that.

486
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,510
Only, please.

487
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:25,690
So. .. only, I will pretend
than ever...

488
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,479
- Pretend that is not happening.
- Do you know your taste?

489
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,640
Flores.

490
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,650
Flowers?

491
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,420
But as...

492
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,420
Rainbow.

493
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:51,650
- I have to go.
- Why did you do that?

494
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,700
Hello, anybody there.

495
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,610
Jonathan Kimball just me.

496
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,440
Are you okay?

497
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:09,350
Tofu Dogs
I hit it.

498
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,450
The opener is next
toilet if you need it, okay?.

499
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,600
Thanks, that's great.

500
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:27,020
You're not going anywhere.

501
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,350
It is not difficult.

502
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,820
See rich.

503
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,930
Now come here.

504
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,130
This is me, I'm drifting
a person 15 years...

505
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:43,100
take my hands
off their chests.

506
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:48,670
Now I'll go through that door, I'll go
home to watch Jeopardy and not go to jail.

507
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,400
Thanks.

508
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,000
- Good.
- What was true.

509
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,200
Tofu did not know that outside
so good but we all love.

510
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,790
Never think that organic is going to be good.

511
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,770
- Hey, where you go.
- I have to.

512
00:40:11,805 --> 00:40:14,020
Let's play Parcheéis.

513
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:18,110
I have to correct some
exams, so I must review.

514
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,270
Thanks was very...
fun.

515
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:24,040
See you tomorrow.

516
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,380
A good time, I knew.

517
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:34,820
- It's her.
- If

518
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,990
Look at this, I'll fuck with it now.

519
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,530
Preparation, preparation.

520
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:51,980

523
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:09,300
- Sorry about earlier.

524
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,240
- Let's see this movie.
- Ok.

525
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:17,270
- Como se llama.

526
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,790
Shit.

527
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,510
Hello. Did not tell me
your friends were here.

528
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,820
- Hey girl.
- Hello.

529
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:29,200
Hello.

530
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:33,220
This is Caroline,
and these are my friends.

531
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:35,930
- Hey, want a beer?
- No.

532
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,010
Sit back, relax.

533
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,980
- She's hot, right?
- Yes.

534
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:50,790
Love you and I thought we

535
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,680
True, I forgot about that.

536
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:57,760
- Want to see "The Notebook".
- No thanks.

537
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:03,390
I was thinking, in a very funny idea.

538
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,570
If you could take your clothes off for them.

539
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,765
I think I
I go home, I have homework.

540
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,190
Caroline No, you have to do this.

541
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,530
You're so hot.
Look at that ass.

542
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,640
Bebe.

543
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,680
She's hot.

544
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,040
What, you have a tremendous
body there is no reason to hide.

545
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,490
Come on, show her skin.

546
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:40,050
If you do not I have
50 other girls who will.

547
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,450
Ryan you are a pig.

548
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,280
Caroline is well, if not
want to call another girl...

549
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,920
... Show them your body.
What's the drama?

550
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,300
Show them some skin.

551
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,660
Raise your arms.

552
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,760
Surrender or what?

553
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:14,660
Take off your bra.
Show off your breasts, show me

554
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:22,560
- Ray.
- You are the man.

555
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,730
Michelle whatever you
"Caroline is a rumor.

556
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:35,640
- I would never do anything with Tyler.
- Do you swear?

557
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:38,340
- If I swear.
- Okay.

558
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:41,220
But listen, I have news.

559
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,650
I decided to do what you said
and try to be more forward.

560
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,340
My father invited some
teachers tonight...

561
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,070
... And I enter the bathroom
with Mr. K.

562
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:54,200
That's a good start
but I was thinking of someone younger.

563
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,830
I was just practicing.

564
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:01,960
My goal still is Tyler, you know what
my parents come out this weekend.

565
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,800
so I thought making a small party.

566
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,890
Oh yes, what kind of party?

567
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:11,140
Nothing great, just
some people.

568
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,540
Have you heard of a
Rainbow party?

569
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:17,540
- Are you serious?
- Okay.

570
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:22,010
I think if you want more
experience this is your chance.

571
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,750
It'll be like a crash course
to become a woman.

572
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:01,890
Hey Colin, oh shit.

573
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,960
Hello.

574
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:07,950
- What the hell are you doing?
- Me?

575
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,240
They are things of yoga.

576
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,080
To the Gym.
Stretching my muscles.

577
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:18,120
I just came to get the number
Tyler, Michelle wants.

578
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,690
Oh if I have it.

579
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:22,950
And what is it?

580
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,500
It's in my phone.

581
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,260
Am I you can give?

582
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:29,950
Not at this time.

583
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,490
Son of your girlfriends, I
I have the same pair.

584
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,710
Huh?

585
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:41,040
I do not think I'll never understand
what happens here.

586
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:52,000
Thursday

587
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,850
Have you heard of something called
Rainbow party.

588
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,230
- Are you playing?
- Que.

589
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,680
What's that, some fags?

590
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,750
No, I think it has to do with bracelets.
- Colin, tell me you know.

591
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,150
- ROY G BIV.
- Who?

592
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,650
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Rainbow Man.

593
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,370
Or if "ROY G. BIV"

594
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:11,030
- John.
- Who the hell is "ROY G. BIV?

595
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,910
An aid to remember
primary colors in the prism.

596
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,380
- Red, orange, yellow, green
- Yes, blue, indigo...

597
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,150
Want to talk about that
shit memory aid.

598
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,790
Or want to know is
Rainbow party.

599
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:25,150
What is it?

600
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,850
A rainbow party is when the girl group
come together and put lipstick different.

601
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,540
And take turns leaving
the guys a rainbow.

602
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,820
... Colors in the penises of the boys.

603
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,930
Idiots!

604
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:40,440
I'm trying to read here!

605
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,440
Damn.

606
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:45,370
Do you also discovered that on the internet?

607
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,410
- No, Opra.
- Opra?

608
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:53,200
She not only gives
free cars, talks about...

609
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,810
important things.

610
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,360
Where did you hear about this party?

611
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,760
April, was on the phone
Michelle and I heard mention.

612
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:06,640
We'll need more details
because I have to be there.

613
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:09,300
- What should I do?
- What?!

614
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:11,910
I have a problem, not you.

615
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,700
Oh man.

616
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:15,920
All right.

617
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,310
That's why they invented the "Levitra".

618
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,850
I can not go to a party
orally for April will be there.

619
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:23,420
- Who cares!
- Really?

620
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:26,480
Others will see
Hence, not just you and her.

621
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:29,650
She'll be sucking
my penis, not yours.

622
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:34,280
Going to be embarrassing me
with her and you two.

623
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,570
I do not like giving bad news
but I'll definitely be there.

624
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:39,390
Yes.

625
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,240
Fuck.

626
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,280
Consuelo wait!

627
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:03,040
Hello Mr. Ryan.

628
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:03,840
Damn!

629
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,560
Do me a favor.

630
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:10,030
Return to Ecuador and low vacuum.

631
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,720
I'm from Guatemala and still
I have to clean the bathroom.

632
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:16,760
- Just go, do me a favor.
- Ok Mr. Ryan, I see him next week.

633
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:17,800
Fuck.

634
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,200
Damn.

635
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:22,480
Shit.

636
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:39,090
- Do these parties evolve?
- What?

637
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,480
You know...

638
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,090
Sex.

639
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,650
How long am the expert?

640
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,310
What are you doing tomorrow.

641
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:49,990
No.

642
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,660
So when?

643
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,140
- That you care.
- Well...

644
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,450
I do not understand.

645
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:00,560
Do many things with the kids,
What sex is not one of them?.

646
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:02,350
I want to stay pure.

647
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:05,870
I have done some things
different guys, but...

648
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:08,510
I'm still waiting for something real.

649
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:11,440
Well I think you're still technically a virgin.

650
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,410
Sucking is not sex.

651
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:17,680
I thought it was a sign of being pure

652
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:21,650
only if you have done something specific.

653
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,740
I no longer want to be a virgin.

654
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:29,710
Then do it with the team
Football whole do what you want.

655
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:31,090
April.

656
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:36,180
I do it because it's easy and fun
and I know I'm not pregnant.

657
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:41,190
Are you waiting until you marry?

658
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:52,790
Hello love.

659
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:54,040
Are you awake?

660
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:57,990
- Love, I came to see.
- Caroline.

661
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,880
What?

662
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:04,090
It's almost 9:00 and are finished with school.

663
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,860
I had a difficult night.

664
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,540
Fuck.

665
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,350
I have a hangover.

666
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,640
I'm sorry baby, what
I can do to help?

667
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,680
You can start
leave me alone.

668
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:25,680
All right.

669
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,900
Cary, Cary. Bebe wait, sorry.

670
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,310
Cary, baby hears.

671
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,670
I was sleeping, I just
wake up, you know how I am.

672
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:43,570
- Ryan This has to stop.
- I know.

673
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,900
I love you but I can
so keep trying.

674
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,990
Last night...

675
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:55,870
I went home to mourn, I was
like a slut does not like your girlfriend.

676
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:58,350
Last night?

677
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:02,790
- What do you mean?
- You know I speak Ryan.

678
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:06,250
What last night?, Was drunk.

679
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:10,940
For the shit
Do you remember when I undress?

680
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:15,260
No, and you took your clothes
Who cares?

681
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,910
It was not just for you.

682
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,200
- Goddamn bitch.
- You wanted.

683
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:24,250
What the hell.
You're a slut.

684
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:26,720

Damn Ryan, you're doing

687
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:39,090
I hate it, I'm not a stripper,

688
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,200

693
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,300
What is that?

694
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,740
A note that my friend
I sent her in class.

695
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:08,070
Am I this cheating?

696
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:12,480

697
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,570
I love you, you speak.

698
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:17,830
You're a liar, you
a whore and a liar.

699
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,200
- Ryan is true.
- You're kidding, here!

700
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:24,820
- Love, that's not my writing.
- Out!

701
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,010
Get out of my house!

702
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,060
- What?
- I wanted to know what you gonna do this weekend.

703
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,370
What do you care?

704
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,230
I'm not doing anything and I thought...

705
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:47,160
- You knew a good thing.
- No.

706
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:48,840
Segura.

707
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:52,000
- No color is it?.
- Color?

708
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,520
Do not have plans with this girl?

709
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:56,900
No. ..

710
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:00,530
So you're telling me no

00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:11,310
- How long are you going to parties?
- Are you talking about, I love the holidays.

714
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:15,350
- There is much we do not know about me.
- Yes, that's true.

715
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,410
I have to answer that.

716
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:27,910

717
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,290

What the hell.

760
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,940
Not bad.

761
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:01,460
If Paula, I'll finish up your breasts.

762
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:05,090

Friday

767
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:31,350
I can not believe
We are doing this.

768
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:35,350
- Not too late to cancel.
- Do not want to cancel...

769
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:38,720
- I'm just a little nervous.
- That's normal.

770
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,080
- Are not you nervous?
- No.

771
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:43,770
Hello.

772
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,910
Look, I'm sorry the other day.

773
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,150
- Do not want to fight you.
- Who is fighting?

774
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:54,600
Whatever you did
was not my case.

775
00:57:54,635 --> 00:57:57,980
Where you been, you never see.

776
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:02,140
- He has been with Ryan.
- The mystery man.

777
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:05,020
April and I are going to have a party,...

778
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:08,200
- Invite some guys y. ..
- Forget Michelle.

779
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,300
You too Michelle,

780
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:13,050
What happened to everyone.

781
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:16,560
No thanks, I have
a boyfriend and I love it.

782
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,540
That has to do that.

783
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:26,020
We are what we
Excellence is not an act...

784
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,650
I have information they wanted.

785
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:31,730
- Forget that, formally invited Tyler.
- What?

786
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:35,130
If your sister's friend
Michelle Jordan called me last night.

787
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:37,720
- I'll call you.
- Yes, I said that April and her...

788
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:40,430
have a party tonight.

789
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:43,600
They will not suck the pole tonight.

790
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,100
She will also invite.

791
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:49,000
- Not exactly, but...
- Arrimarte going to the party.

792
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,900
Fuck yeah, yeah I have to.

793
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,580
Nothing gets in my way and this
party with girls who suck penises.

794
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:56,730
- True Friend.
- Do not know.

795
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,720
- Sounded intimate.
- Of course it was intimate...

796
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:01,800
What is more intimate than a puff.

797
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:03,640
A "Footjob".

798
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,490
Select sounded like by invitation only.

799
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:14,380
- What happened to our plan?
- The plan changed when I was invited.

800
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:15,790
Shit.

801
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:18,680
While knowing where and when,
I will be in the street...

802
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,870
straw making me
with binoculars.

803
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:22,600
- Enough.
- Enough?

804
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,640
John, maybe I can
explain the relevance...

805
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:31,670
that the theme nude teen
the Cuban missile crisis?

806
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:34,730
Just "advertising"

807
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:39,750
These presentations are for Monday.
I hope you use your time well.

808
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,750
This is for everyone.

809
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,680
- Thanks.
- Yes please.

810
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,610
Colin shit, no echo
not shit all week.

811
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:50,960
Fuck, party "Rainbow."

812
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:51,780
Look...

813
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:55,440
- We have to meet tomorrow to finish this.
- Okay.

814
00:59:55,570 --> 01:00:00,180
- Too bad for you, my partner finish it.
- Who is your partner?

815
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:01,800
Did you do anything?

816
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:05,800
She said that I have that
do anything if I let her calm.

817
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,490
Highly...

818
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:18,400
Retarded.

819
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,200
Mr. Johnson, sit down.

820
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:30,240
- I like this art, has potential.
- Thanks.

821
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:33,130
We have received numerous complaints...

822
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,460
The use of their language
Obscene in the library.

823
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:38,750
I do not, sure it was me.

824
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:42,870
Apparently this
upsetting their peers.

825
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:47,440
And mocks the environment
this school's academic...

826
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,030
much pride.

827
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:53,070
- I'll be honest with you, Mr. Jordan
- Dr. Jordan.

828
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:55,580
- It's Doctor.
- Yes.

829
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:57,850
And the director.

830
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,240
Doctor Director.

831
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,220
You know, I think...

832
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:08,080
I think a punishment
Saturday would do much for you.

833
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:10,190
- What do you think?
- No.

834
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:14,000
That does not make much
my, I have rights.

835
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,650
such as freedom of speech.

836
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,190
Yes, and my father is a lawyer,

837
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:23,780
He can come here and talk
this, I and my Father lawyer.

838
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:26,580
- Your father is my plumber.
- Look, well...

839
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:30,000
Sometimes it is the plumber

840
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:33,490
is like a Good Samaritan
Look, I have read the "Magna Carta"

841
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:38,220
I know all the rules to talk.

842
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:40,440
That was easy.

843
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:44,640
Let's play, can we?
Do you like games?

844
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:46,610
- I love games.
- Sure.

845
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:47,610
You know what this is?

846
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:51,010
- An 8-ball.
- Right, it's a magic 8 ball.

847
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,870
Do you know what is done with the magic ball?

848
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:55,090
You ask him something and gives you an answer.

849
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:57,670
- We ask you something John.
- Ok.

850
01:01:57,710 --> 01:02:00,560
"John deserves a punishment on Saturday?

851
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,220
No, look in your heart, it
it's silly, it does nothing...

852
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:07,010
is just a ball with a bucket.

853
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:10,480
"I do not think"
Good.

854
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:14,620
Great, a good method.
I like it.

855
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:18,100
I'll let go with a warning.

856
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:19,800
This time.

857
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,960
Thanks.

858
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,310
Thank you, thank you.

859
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,130
- What is it?
- That was easy.

860
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:29,500
Is that we were, I was painting...

861
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:31,830
That is exactly what John was talking,

862
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,630
You have to wipe, clean
your actions, clean your mouth.

863
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,220
And out of my office.

864
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:40,360
- A warning, just this once.
- Thanks for the warning.

865
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,870
- Damn.
- What?

866
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:46,070
I said I feel sick.

867
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,140
Flu.

868
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:48,430
Sorry thanks.

869
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,340
I love my job.

870
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:12,590
- Should we do this?
- You're the expert.

871
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:15,980
I do not go to buy pen
labial to prepare.

872
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:22,580
Caroline has become
a bitch or what?.

873
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:25,180
So do not let these
meetings from becoming serious.

874
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:26,230
Once he does.

875
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,810
I do not mind, my
plan tonight is...

876
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:31,080
Tyler teach what you need...

877
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,650
And then, you might want to date me.

878
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,830
Or you can go on,
but whatever.

879
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:38,820
Need help.

880
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:41,490
Are these sores that come from?

881
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:43,320
No, those are there.

882
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,250
Well.

883
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:49,350
Well.

884
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,790
- What are we doing tonight?
- Let's get some girls.

885
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:53,850
If girls.
Ryan?

886
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:56,770
In reality, whatever they want,

887
01:03:57,290 --> 01:04:00,570
- I'm going to a party tonight.
- What fucking party man?

888
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:03,050
Remember that
girl the other night.

889
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:07,720
What do you do with these
high school girls?

890
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,890
First, girls
secondary are very hot.

891
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:14,660
Second, they love
fuck with older men.

892
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:18,860
Do you know what, because
types of secondary school age...

893
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,460
do not know how to use their penises.

894
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,980
That's why we put
online for us.

895
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:29,840
That's what I tell women this
made for man's pleasure.

896
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:32,660
What the Bible says. I read it.

897
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,780
If, as is.

898
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,920
If you are getting screwed as you say,

899
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:40,810
They must be very ill.

900
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:43,570
Maybe even have worms.

901
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:47,430
I have seen worms in them.

902
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:50,190
But if there are very, very small.

903
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:54,110
In addition, these girls are still virgins.

904
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:56,060
They are clean y. ..

905
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,660
We "deflowered."

906
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,420
- Nothing like exploiting a cherry.
- Well, I scored.

907
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:01,820
Where is it?

908
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:05,650
If I do not know. It is in the house
a girl, I'm not sure.

909
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:10,040
- That you're not a damn.
- Yes, share your wealth.

910
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:12,800
Only some people are,
and invited me.

911
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:16,020
I do not think it would be good show
with a couple guys, know what I mean.

912
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:18,650
- This is fucked.
- If you fuck.

913
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:22,220
Next time, I promise.

914
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:25,260
She is.

915
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:29,540
Hello.

916
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:32,590
Hi Mom.
How is Australia?

917
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,130
Well, you know...

918
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:40,250
doing some homework.

919
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:44,720
I have another call
and I have to deal with it.

920
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:47,470
Do me a favor and tell
hi dad

921
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:50,650
Have a good
trip, see you soon.

922
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,970
Ok, I love you too mama goodbye.
Goodbye.

923
01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:01,190
- Ryan, I miss you love.
- Oh Caroline, how's it going?

924
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:03,980
Ryan, sorry love.

925
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:07,610
I go through there.

926
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,880
I'm not okay...

927
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:12,590
- I'm going out tonight.
- Where?

928
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,490
We talk later, bye.

929
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:19,000
Bitch.

930
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:27,995
Is that all?.

931
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:31,670
An hour and a half before
die and go to heaven.

932
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,640
We?

933
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:35,740
- Come on buddy.
- I can not.

934
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:39,780
We'll have to
give a spy camera,

935
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:42,810
Because if this is true
and we have recorded...

936
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:45,600
We will be set for life.

937
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:51,140
- Did you remember your Vitamin C?
- Yes.

938
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:52,350
And your Vitamin E?

939
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,290
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

940
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:56,670
- Take my "Ginkgo."
- Well

941
01:06:57,310 --> 01:06:59,920
Hello love, and we almost got.
Hi April.

942
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:03,720
- Hello April.
- Well have fun and not worry.

943
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,130
I do not care about you love.

944
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:10,290
Let's review the history notes
because we have a big test.

945
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:14,850
Do not work too hard.
Remember, there are more than just school.

946
01:07:15,810 --> 01:07:18,860
Do not worry, I will
sure have fun.

947
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:21,800
I love you sweetness.

948
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:24,140
- Me too.
- Goodbye girls.

949
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,270
Look at them.

950
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:35,070
- They are so ingenious.
- I'm going to change.

951
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,645
I do not understand.

952
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:43,010
If you will use different lipsticks,
Is not going to see just a brown stain?

953
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:43,950
I guess.

954
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,870
- "Then there is the Rainbow?
- I do not know, who cares,

955
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:50,630
You can paint my penis long Rosado
when you have the attention of a girl.

956
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:52,530
Let's see if this still goes well.

957
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,280
Who is it?

958
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:10,540
It's Caroline.

959
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,940
You may answer if you want.
Maybe he decided to come.

960
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:20,220
- Hello.
- Michelle?

961
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:24,140
I'm not April, Michelle
not here right now.

962
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:27,790
- Hi April, this is Tyler.
- I know.

963
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:31,450
I wanted to know if
party was still going.

964
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:35,300
Well, you know Michelle
not feeling very well.

965
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:37,930
So do not think it's going to happen.

966
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:40,550
Need that bad.

967
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:42,930
I know.

968
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:45,020
I was excited to see you.

969
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:50,220
- Do you want me now?
- Yes, yes, it would be funny

970
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,440
- Do you want to go there?
- No, I will go there.

971
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:56,110
See you soon.

972
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:03,220
What the hell, there is no party "Rainbow"?

973
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,340
- April said no.
- God will never leave me happy.

974
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:08,060
The party was canceled.

975
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:16,970
- What do you think?
- That's hot.

976
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:19,480
- Enough for Tyler.
- We'll see.

977
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:22,640
- Comes Caroline?
- She said to try to come.

978
01:09:22,675 --> 01:09:23,940
That's fine.

979
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,740
- I think I go home and change.
- What?

980
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:30,620
You look great,
Are you going to be on time?

981
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,770
Of course Michelle, do you think
I'm going to miss on your big night?

982
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:36,030
I'll be back.

983
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:56,040
Hi, Michelle.

984
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:57,400
Hello.

985
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,180
I'm John.

986
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:02,380
- Oh yeah, how's it going?
- Well, you know.

987
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:04,590
Tyler said you were going to have a party.

988
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:10,510
We were thinking of doing that,
but I think I'm going to study.

989
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:11,890
What cerium?!

990
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:16,730
Because these dressed as...
if you went to a party.

991
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:21,600
Is not that, it's just...
a quiet night.

992
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:26,610
I'll keep working.

993
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:29,950
I'm here, if you want...

994
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:33,210
idle?, maybe you
I can help you study.

995
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:35,680
I'm fine.

996
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:43,400
Someone told you
you have beautiful feet.

997
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,010
If you see at school.

998
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:52,360
Sexy bitch.

999
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,030
Scrotum-On, apply it to your testicles.

1000
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:17,090
Scrotum-On, apply it to your testicles.
Scrotum-On directly from your testicles.

1001
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:21,280
I love those commercials,
but I hate the product.

1002
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:24,610
You know, I always thought you were hot.

1003
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:33,900
What the hell?

1004
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:35,640
Where is everybody?

1005
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:41,180
8:23

1006
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:50,170
- Let me look for a condom.
- No.

1007
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,530
- Are you taking the pill?
- No.

1008
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:56,710
- What?
- Relax, I'm good at other things.

1009
01:11:57,490 --> 01:11:58,980
If I remember.

1010
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:00,610
What?

1011
01:12:00,970 --> 01:12:03,600
No, it's a good thing you were
excellent the other day.

1012
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,430
What do you mean?

1013
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:09,210
After school the other day.
In the pit wall.

1014
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:11,530
I was.
Great, I adore.

1015
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:15,950
- What the fuck?
- Do not worry, I do not think badly of you.

1016
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:18,040
I really hot.

1017
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:20,190
It's the best I have given suck.

1018
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:25,230
Look, I know with whom I
state and you are not one.

1019
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:29,750
I know you did not know who he was,
but it was me, and it was great.

1020
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,300
The "Glory Hole."

1021
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,240
Does "Glory Hole"?

1022
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:50,870
- Hello.
- Hello.

1023
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:54,530
There is a party, is o. ..?

1024
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:57,320
Yeah, you are?

1025
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:58,510
Ryan.

1026
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:00,210
Oh.

1027
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:03,690
I'm Michelle, so...

1028
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,760
comes...

1029
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,300
To start this party.

1030
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:21,960
So tell me?

1031
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:24,750
Where is everybody?

1032
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:29,550
Looks like they're late or something.

1033
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:31,790
Great.

1034
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,920
Your lip is sensual.

1035
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,250
You think?

1036
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:49,480
- So you want to go upstairs?
- Yes.

1037
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,840
Ganame now April.

1038
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:20,740
If you suck my dick...

1039
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:23,310
Oh yeah...

1040
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,460
Michelle.

1041
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:50,770
We scored.

1042
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:21,000
Where did you learn to fuck like that?

1043
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:24,230
MTV.

1044
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:33,490
You're amazing.

1045
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:47,230
- No, stay there.
- Tyler...

1046
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:49,870
- I told you.
- I'm just returning the favor.

1047
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:54,210
- No, I'm fine.
- Relax, I just want to test you.

1048
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,020
- I promise you'll like it.
- No, I...

1049
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,900
- I do not shave today.
- Do not worry...

1050
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:02,340
The inside is what counts.

1051
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:31,590
- Happens.
- Hello.

1052
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:36,560
- I like your skirt.
- Thanks.

1053
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:40,010
- Sure.
- I miss much today.

1054
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,350
Miss you too.

1055
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,270
- Yes?
- Very.

1056
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:58,850
I'm sorry for everything.

1057
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:00,140
All right.

1058
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:04,430
And also...

1059
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:08,050
I'm leaving the cocaine.

1060
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:10,830
Although it is tempting...

1061
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:14,150
- But I work on that.
- Oh dear.

1062
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,780
Saturday

1063
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,360
- You are terrible.
- No, I think it's over.

1064
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:32,850
- No, not the command, like stink
- Ryan.

1065
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:36,910
- Did you come to give us another show?
- Yes.

1066
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:39,930
What?

1067
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:52,860
How many times you tell me
you left the cocaine.

1068
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:54,980
I left the cocaine
when I'm with you.

1069
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,650
You were up and I was down.

1070
01:17:58,610 --> 01:18:02,880
Love, hate when you do.
You mean to me.

1071
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:07,340
It's just that you were last night
so loving and special.

1072
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:08,775
Forget that shit y. ..

1073
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:12,210
Oh, that shit is my life.
OK?

1074
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:16,110
That is who I am. If
want to be by my side...

1075
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:19,480
and be part of my life, you
have to understand, okay?

1076
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:24,490
Please do not show me that face.

1077
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:26,360
This is the time to men.

1078
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:30,450
- It is time for Pimp and Whore.
- Oh yeah, tell man.

1079
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:36,770
I have to take drugs and people
I do not want to see, like you.

1080
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:38,940
Dame line, goodbye.

1081
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:58,180
Tyler: What happens amazing
last night, will you come?

1082
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:06,660
Ok... at a time for more!

1083
01:19:14,038 --> 01:19:15,238
What happens?

1084
01:19:18,139 --> 01:19:19,239
- Hello.
- Hello.

1085
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:25,700
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1086
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:28,730
Nothing, that's good.

1087
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:35,800
Because I was thinking it's a
good time for me suck.

1088
01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:38,500
Ryan for.

1089
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:41,090
What's wrong?

1090
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:44,920
Why these games?

1091
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:52,410
You have this fantastic nice clothes
and do not want to suck my penis.

1092
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,910
What the hell!

1093
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,970
- Sorry.
- What the fuck you?

1094
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:01,780
- Sorry, I did not.
- You would not...

1095
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:06,620
You know what, you're a whore.

1096
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,620
Sometimes I hate you.

1097
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,230
Did you know?

1098
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,900
- Sorry.
- I know.

1099
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,170
All right.

1100
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:21,630
Ryan.

1101
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:47,090
- Hello.
- What the hell happened?

1102
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:50,220
I have a story for you.

1103
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:59,580
Let me go to the bathroom.

1104
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:26,960
April, what happens?

1105
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:28,940
Hello.

1106
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,110
What happened?

1107
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:43,630
The party was not worth anything to be honest.

1108
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:45,420
What happened to your hand?

1109
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:49,980
I'll tell you, I went to
Michelle's home y. ..

1110
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,180
We have the entire site for us.

1111
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:06,590
Come up.

1112
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:08,660
Eventually I lost my balance y. ..

1113
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,960
If it was brutal, but thank
God it was my left arm.

1114
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:17,120
Thank God.

1115
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:25,090
- Today?
- No.

1116
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:28,090
- Why not?
- Because I am a virgin.

1117
01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:31,370
- Me too.
- Never mind, I'll check.

1118
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:34,740
- Why?
- Look, do you want a suck or what?

1119
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:38,460
I have to go to Tyler's house
and finish this damn project.

1120
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:40,150
Come on.

1121
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:42,220
If you want.

1122
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,430
I think I love you.

1123
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,280
I know they want.

1124
01:22:58,380 --> 01:22:59,640
I can not Tyler.

1125
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:05,350
And if...

1126
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:10,370
- What do you think?
- I guess.

1127
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:16,480
Tyler!

1128
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:26,880
Where is it?
Tyler!

1129
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,650
No way.

1130
01:23:44,570 --> 01:23:46,280
- This is our chance.
- What?

1131
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:47,920
- "Seagull"
- Do you believe?

1132
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:48,970
Why not.

1133
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:51,220
"When these opportunities?

1134
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:55,870
Exactly what
we do is get y. ..

1135
01:23:56,150 --> 01:23:58,190
... I'm going to go near her bed.

1136
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,770
You stay here.

1137
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:01,950
And when the magic moment arrives...

1138
01:24:02,610 --> 01:24:05,390
- We left, what do you think?
- Who is?

1139
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:08,090
- It does not matter.
- Get in the game.

1140
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,460
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

1141
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:44,330
Slowly.

1142
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:03,750
Now.

1143
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:09,620
- Shit.
- Run.

1144
01:25:09,690 --> 01:25:11,070
Fuck friends.

1145
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:13,390
Are you okay?

1146
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:15,500
Want to go?

1147
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:58,420
This is nice.

1148
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:07,060
How was the weekend?
How is school?

1149
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:09,060
- All right.
- Okay.

1150
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:14,970
The contractor's Coming
week to fix the upstairs bathroom.

1151
01:26:15,610 --> 01:26:17,000
Finally.

1152
01:26:17,290 --> 01:26:20,610
That hole in the wall
finally going to be closed.

1153
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:24,070
It will not disturb this April.

1154
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,840
Sunday

1155
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:43,850
I want you inside me.

1156
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:46,140
Now?

1157
01:27:27,090 --> 01:27:28,940
I can not live without you.

1158
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:31,520
You are very sweet.

1159
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:38,370
Michelle!

1160
01:27:38,710 --> 01:27:41,750
- What are you doing here?
- He is my boyfriend.

1161
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,600
Do you know?

1162
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:49,040
What the hell, Ryan.

1163
01:27:49,170 --> 01:27:51,700
Okay, okay.

1164
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:54,440
Come here...

1165
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:56,790
Not what you think.

1166
01:27:57,070 --> 01:27:58,740
So what is it?

1167
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:00,130
I'll show you.

1168
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:01,940
Right now.

1169
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:03,970
Come, come.

1170
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:05,220
Just come.

1171
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:06,480
- Trust me.
- No Ryan.

1172
01:28:21,310 --> 01:28:23,320
No, no, come here.

1173
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:25,940
All right.

1174
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:28,730
Mira.

1175
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:52,720
Come on.

1176
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:53,950
Come on, kiss her.

1177
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:03,490
That was one of the worst
flights I've had in my life.

1178
01:29:04,510 --> 01:29:05,910
Michelle...

1179
01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:08,100
Honey are you home?

1180
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:10,940
Must be in the library.

1181
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:31,790
She fucks better than you.

1182
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:36,660
But I love you Ryan.

1183
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:41,970
I do not I love you and will never love you.

1184
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:43,880
Please just go.

1185
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:49,220
Zorra.

1186
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:54,140
Like it?

1187
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:28,600
THIS WEEK

1188
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:33,520
I did my part, we have an A.

1189
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:34,860
Now it's up to you.

1190
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,320
Why not... we took this.

1191
01:31:39,110 --> 01:31:41,780
- "This is between us?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1192
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:45,090
Slowly, I enjoy the moment.

1193
01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:52,090
Oh my god, yeah.

1194
01:31:56,390 --> 01:31:57,450
Well!

1195
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:59,210
Yes!

1196
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:02,930
Give it!

1197
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,020
Hell yeah!

1198
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:08,660
No hands!

1199
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:10,640
Yes!

1200
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:15,100
I record it.
It will be hot!

1201
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:16,740
What if someone sees?

1202
01:32:17,090 --> 01:32:20,070
Be deprived, I promise.

1203
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:22,280
I love you.

1204
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:38,640
How are you?

1205
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:43,090
- Any problem with the lab?
- It's all good in the Lab

1206
01:32:43,310 --> 01:32:45,260
But I was wondering if...

1207
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:48,840
could happen to
home after school.

1208
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:52,870
Why review a little
female anatomy?

1209
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:56,080
- Caroline, I am a professor of chemistry.
- I know.

1210
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:57,920
Puta.

1211
01:32:58,260 --> 01:33:01,880
Because you care,
you catch your my boyfriend.

1212
01:33:01,950 --> 01:33:03,300
Do not put words in my mouth.

1213
01:33:03,370 --> 01:33:06,230
- I'll put my vagina in your mouth.
- I prefer Ryan.

1214
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:13,220
- Fuck fuck.
- Have 4 times in a row?

1215
01:33:15,810 --> 01:33:17,650
Sorry boy was distracted.

1216
01:33:18,410 --> 01:33:20,220
- Excuse me.
- Cool.

1217
01:33:28,050 --> 01:33:30,570
Hello.
Hello dear.

1218
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:33,260
Take Ginkgo like you asked.

1219
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:37,020
Well. And the extra green, green...

1220
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:40,760
That green thing, what
was. This vegetarian.

1221
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,400
The Vibrance, that is.

1222
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:46,860
To take and tastes great.

1223
01:33:48,150 --> 01:33:49,630
Just then, yes.

1224
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:57,630
I seem to seek care,
I will go to the office.

1225
01:34:01,390 --> 01:34:05,210
See you at dinner time.
Ok, thanks dear.

1226
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:16,000
Vegetarian this.

1227
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:32,970
What happens? this is Ryan.
Let.

1228
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:34,960
This message is for Ryan Thompson.

1229
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:38,370
In the clinic, I have the results.

1230
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:41,950
He was diagnosed
Lumpacema Pallidum.

1231
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:44,930
Its common name is...

1232
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:46,420
"Crabs"

1233
01:34:47,330 --> 01:34:49,830
Your feet are amazing.

1234
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:54,810
I would stay,
but I have to go.

1235
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:57,730
And what about me?

1236
01:34:57,810 --> 01:35:00,340
You are not the only one
who likes feet.

1237
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:06,350
You know you're going to do
next project right?

1238
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:08,350
I do not want to scare you,
or anything like that but...

1239
01:35:08,710 --> 01:35:10,700
I have this rare condition.

1240
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:13,530
No way...
