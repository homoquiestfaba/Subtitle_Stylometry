A
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:22,720
KIMERA - Strange Seduction
- The Inner Life of Martin Frost -

2
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,531
The house was empty.

3
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,877
Your friends Jack and Diane Rastall not
return home until the end of the year.

4
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,548
If Martin wanted to quit
New York, said Jack ...

5
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,346
he could stay in their homes,
How long wanted.

6
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,328
Martin spent three years
writing a novel ...

7
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,491
and his brain was tired.
He needed rest.

8
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,963
He had no plans.

9
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,099
I just wanted to spend some
within weeks, doing nothing.

10
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,577
To live like a rock.

11
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,816
But what did he know?

12
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,797
A few hours of silence,
some gusts of fresh air ...

13
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:55,234
and suddenly, an idea for a
story appeared in his head.

14
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,405
It seems to be well
that works with stories.

15
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:03,102
In a minute, there's nothing.
And next, it is there.

16
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,371
Inside you.

17
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,213
It may not have the machine
world's newest ...

18
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,052
but it worked.

19
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:56,429
CAN NOT BE MORE NEW MACHINE
THE WORLD, BUT IT WORKS

20
00:04:56,429 --> 00:05:00,633
It would be a long story.
25 or 30 pages.

21
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,464
40 at most.

22
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,400
Martin did not know how long
need to write.

23
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:08,632
But decided to stay
the house to finish.

24
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,979
This was the new plan.
He would write the story ...

25
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,573
and would not leave until you finish.

26
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,872
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

27
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,908
No! Who are you?
What are you doing here?

28
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,967
- I?
- Hey!

29
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,681
- It's close enough.
- I'm Martin Frost.

30
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,015
Not that any of your business.

31
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:27,418
If you do not tell me now who you are,
I have to call the police.

32
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,947
You are Martin Frost?

33
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,959
The real Martin Frost?

34
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,427
That's what I said.
I have to speak again?

35
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,799
Because I know you, that's all.
I do not know really, but ...

36
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,257
know who you are.
You are Martin Frost, the writer.

37
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,994
Friend of Jack and Diane.

38
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,537
- Do you know Jack and Diane?
- I am a niece of Diane.

39
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,445
- What is your name?
- Claire.

40
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,573
- Claire what?
- Claire ...

41
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,947
Martin.

42
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,521
What is this?
Some kind of joke?

43
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,682
I can not do anything.
That's my name.

44
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,654
What are you doing here,
Claire Martin?

45
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,759
Diane invited me.
Look, if you do not believe me ...

46
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,003
See? Diane gave me
the key to the front door.

47
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:22,066
- And why Jack gave me this one?
- Because ...

48
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,945
Why is Jack. So.
You know them.

49
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,436
He and Diane are always
things like that.

50
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:42,053
Well, not like that.
I came here to be alone.

51
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,459
I have work to do.
And here you are ...

52
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,591
Well, not being alone, is not it?

53
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,074
Do not worry.
I will not stand in your way.

54
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,974
I am here for
working on my thesis.

55
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,609
- I have read a lot.
- Reading is bad for your health.

56
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:04,183
Only books of high cholesterol.
I read them without fat.

57
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,673
Things vegetarian.

58
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,388
What is your area, history of cooked turnip?

59
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,557
- Philosophy.
- Philosophy?

60
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,796
Chewy, but somewhat tasteless.

61
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,162
This weekend,
I read Bishop Berkeley.

62
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,868
'If a tree falls in the forest
and no one hears ...

63
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:25,861
- It produces a sound or not? '
- It's' The tree is really there? '.

64
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,209
Berkeley said that matter does not exist,
and everything is in our head.

65
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,546
Yes, but you do not
is in my head.

66
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,538
You exist and I have to divide
this house with you.

67
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,852
I will be very discreet, I promise.

68
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,618
I put my stuff in another room
and will not even notice I'm here.

69
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,793
Right.

70
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:00,237
You get out of my way
and I stay out of yours, okay?

71
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:05,945
If that's what you want,
is how it goes.

72
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,207
Great.

73
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:11,781
I work now.
Even more.

74
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,486
But you just said
do not want to see me.

75
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:19,057
It is a figure of speech.
It means "goodbye".

76
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,558
Goodbye.

77
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,301
Bye, Martin.

78
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:42,048
'And it seems no less evident
that the various sensations or ideas ...

79
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:45,952
imprinted on the senses, even if
have mixed or combined ...

80
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,718
can not exist except
in mind that a notice. '

81
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,103
'Secondly, it will be challenged
there is a big difference ...

82
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,173
between real fire
and the idea of ??fire.

83
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:11,940
Between dream and imagine themselves to
and actually be burned. '

84
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,041
Hello

85
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,613
Sorry for not being
very nice to you this morning.

86
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,154
I should not have acted that way.

87
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:03,324
- What time is it?
- Six or so.

88
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,798
I still have time to read.
Why we are not ...

89
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,562
in the living room in half an hour
for a drink?

90
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,027
Good idea.

91
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,803
I mean, since we live
with one another, let's be civilized.

92
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:34,616
She's wearing that shirt because
Berkeley is reading this week?

93
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,094
To have any
the next week writing 'Hume'?

94
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:44,036
No, this here is 'Berkeley.'
The philosopher I'm reading 'Berkeley.'

95
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,906
- There is a difference in pronunciation.
- No, the spelling is the same ...

96
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,674
then, is the same word.

97
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,444
It is the same spelling,
but they are two different words.

98
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,847
- Are you trying to confuse me?
- What are you saying, Mr. Frost?

99
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:58,613
He has written a story with
two characters with the same name.

100
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,984
So, you read that story?

101
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:08,027
You must be one of six people
the universe in the know.

102
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:13,124
It was published in a
small magazine for over 15 years.

103
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:18,166
I read everything you wrote.
The four novels and two plays.

104
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,338
But I just published three novels.

105
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,804
But there's a new, right?

106
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,612
You gave a copy of the text
Jack and Diane.

107
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,046
Diane lent to me
and read last week.

108
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,013
I think it's the best
thing you've done.

109
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:49,602
In other words,
Miss. Martin approves?

110
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,969
Yes, for sure.

111
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:59,772
- Ms. Martin approves the Martin?
- Yes, Martin.

112
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,178
Miss. Martin approves Martin.

113
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:08,778
It reads 'Berkeley' in 'Berkeley'.
Or 'Berkeley' in 'Berkeley'?

114
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,791
The shirt that says?
The man or college?

115
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:16,387
The two.
It's what you mean.

116
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,419
Or ...

117
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,359
means nothing.

118
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,832
Well, it's a way
to eliminate confusion.

119
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,305
Simple logic.

120
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:37,683
And eliminating one type of confusion,
is creating another.

121
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:41,949
Do not get confused, Martin,
I'm being as clear as possible.

122
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,054
Claire is clear.

123
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:51,462
- And Claire is beautiful.
- Do you?

124
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,490
Yes, for sure.

125
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,829
Every story has a format.

126
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,799
And the format
each story is different ...

127
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,970
the format of another story.

128
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:52,424
Some follow straight lines,
other circles are ...

129
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,291
zigzags or pirouettes.

130
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:32,264
Instead of following one direction,
the story of Martin ...

131
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,034
seems to be going around
around itself.

132
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,871
Or going into
a series of right angles ...

133
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:43,240
or going in a spiral fashion
to an invisible point in the center.

134
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,314
So perhaps.

135
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,787
Or so.

136
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:21,080
Be that as it was the story,
Martin was making ...

137
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,882
and each day was
going further with it.

138
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,077
Understanding it a little better.

139
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,721
And every day, he put
more pages in the pile.

140
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,521
And he said to him: 'If you do not believe
me, I'll show you. '

141
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,094
So I put the pocket e. ..

142
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,468
What is this?

143
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,973
- What is what?
- That noise? Have not you heard?

144
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,470
This!

145
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,970
Yes, I heard.

146
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,349
It's kind of a bell, is not it?

147
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:36,817
It is a bell.
Perhaps a clatter.

148
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,455
It seems the outside world.

149
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,595
I mean,
other people besides us?

150
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,325
I think not.
It must be an illusion.

151
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:52,727
Hello? Jack!
How are you?

152
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,499
Jack and Diane.

153
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,673
Calcutta? Are in Calcutta.

154
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,504
Boiler?

155
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,009
Diane is concerned with the boiler.

156
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,719
Right.

157
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:13,353
If something goes wrong,
call Jim Fortunato.

158
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,793
'Fortunato Plumbing & Heat'.
I see.

159
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,934
Glad you called,
Claire and I were discussing ...

160
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,529
if you was real or not.
What do I tell her?

161
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,238
As well, 'Who is Claire?'
Claire Martin, niece of Diane.

162
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,644
What?

163
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,954
Claire!

164
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,920
Claire!

165
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:11,438
What's going on, Claire?
Say what is happening.

166
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,675
You gotta tell me!

167
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,987
I'm listening.
Do not shout, Martin.

168
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:25,164
I just learn that Diane
has a sister who has two children.

169
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,067
Two boys, which gives
two nephews, Claire ...

170
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,898
but no niece.

171
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,307
I did not know what to do. I had to find
one way to do it trust me

172
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,277
I thought after a few days,
you would find yourself ...

173
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,213
- And do not care anymore.
- Find out what?

174
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,010
You do not understand, Martin?

175
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:49,218
We've been together almost a week.
And saying that is not understood.

176
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,589
Who are you?
What the hell are you doing here?

177
00:19:55,627 --> 00:20:00,699
- Martin, no matter who I am.
- Of course it matters.

178
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,502
- Very important.
- Honey, do not matter.

179
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:07,063
- How can you say that?
- No matter why you love.

180
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,071
Because you want me,
that's what matters, right?

181
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,010
The rest is nothing.

182
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,528
Unfortunately, Claire was right.

183
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,631
Martin loved her and wanted to ...

184
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,759
but how you love someone
do not trust?

185
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:54,775
Treatise of Human Nature

186
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,533
The food is ready, Martin.

187
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,763
I'll wait for you
in the dining room.

188
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:05,606
Are you okay?

189
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,839
It looks good.

190
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:47,382
So Martin, how's your story?

191
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,198
Who are you, Claire?
What are you doing here?

192
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:57,032
No, answer my question first.
How is your story?

193
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:02,095
Please, Martin,
is very important.

194
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:08,206
- Want to know?
- Yes, I want to know.

195
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:12,681
Okay, I'll tell you how it's going.

196
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,125
It's going well.

197
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:24,152
Well? Or very well?

198
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,169
Very well.
I would say that is going very well.

199
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,295
Got it?

200
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:37,542
- Understand what?
- Martin, of course I understand.

201
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:41,947
No, Claire, no.
I did not understand anything.

202
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:45,849
And if you want the truth,
I am completely lost.

203
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,243
Martin should not be
so hard on yourself.

204
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,536
Not bad.
What do you think, Martin?

205
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,982
Damn!
I think not.

206
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:21,442
That night, Martin took one of
most important decisions of your life.

207
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:25,584
He decided not
do any more questions.

208
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,712
Claire asked him to trust her.

209
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,787
And instead of pressing it,
he decided to close their eyes and jump.

210
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,661
He had no idea
than expected at the end ...

211
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,687
but this did not mean
not worth the risk.

212
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:45,170
Then he continued falling in love.
And a week later ...

213
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,974
when he began to think
that nothing would go wrong ...

214
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,340
Claire went for a walk.

215
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,281
She seemed to be fine.

216
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,650
Only a faint
unwell, thought.

217
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,513
But the next morning,
Claire woke up with a high fever.

218
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,777
She did not complain.
His skin was hot ...

219
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:35,075
but she seemed in good humor.

220
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,117
After a while,
she put him out of the room ...

221
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,517
insisting that
returned to its history.

222
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:52,427
The next morning,
fever was worse.

223
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:56,360
Martin said he would take the day
off, whether she liked it or not.

224
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,070
He sat beside her
for several hours ...

225
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,302
and in the afternoon,
she seemed to be improving.

226
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:08,235
The fever subsided and suddenly
she returned to the old Claire.

227
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:15,613
'The things we see are not
for themselves what we see.

228
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:21,826
So if we change the subject or
the subjective form of our senses ...

229
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:25,997
all qualities, all relations
of objects in space and time ...

230
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:29,592
not only but also
their own space and time ...

231
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,865
would disappear. '

232
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,415
Martin felt encouraged.

233
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:03,234
And the next day,
he returned to his story.

234
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,479
He worked directly
for three or four hours.

235
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,380
Then he returned to the room
to check on Claire.

236
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:23,614
It was cold that day.
Much cooler than the day before.

237
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,719
Diane was right
in worrying about the boiler.

238
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:31,696
Martin should have called the Fortunate,
but so many things happened ...

239
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,493
he just forgot.

240
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,727
Do not want to wake you.
Sorry.

241
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:11,061
Hello, Martin.
How's my beautiful man?

242
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:26,850
- You're burning.
- I'm feeling good.

243
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:32,891
It is the third day, Claire.
I think we should call a doctor.

244
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:37,624
I do not need it.
Just give me some aspirin ... more

245
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,529
and in half an hour I'll be right.

246
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,699
This is not good, Claire.

247
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:50,468
I really think that
you should see a doctor.

248
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,344
Tell us what is
happening in the story.

249
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:00,485
- This will make me feel better.
- It has to rest.

250
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:04,012
Please Martin, just a little.

251
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:12,797
It's night now.
He left the house.

252
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:16,255
Anna is on the way.
But he did not know it.

253
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:21,671
If she does not get there soon,
it will fall into the trap.

254
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,174
- She'll get?
- Does not matter.

255
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:28,036
What matters is that
she is going to meet him.

256
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,572
She is in love with him, right?

257
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,483
In a way, yes.

258
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,391
She is putting
his life in danger by it.

259
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:44,754
It is a form of love, is not it?

260
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,877
How much longer?

261
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,146
Two or three pages.
I'm almost done.

262
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,819
- Write them down now.
- They can wait.

263
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,921
- I do it tomorrow.
- No, write now.

264
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:13,118
You have to write now.

265
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,593
What are you doing?

266
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,869
My God, Martin,
what are you doing?

267
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,237
I'm buying you back, Claire.

268
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,084
The 37 pages for his life
is the greatest bargain I've ever seen.

269
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,253
But you can not do that!
It is forbidden!

270
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:39,056
Maybe so, but I'll do
anyway. I changed the rules.

271
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:42,457
Martin! Martin!

272
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,091
You do not know what he did.

273
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,833
That is, Claire.
They are just words.

274
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,198
There were 37 pages
and nothing but words.

275
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,449
What do we do?

276
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,524
Tell me, Martin.

277
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,897
What do we do?

278
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:06,177
- Everything will be alright.
- How can you be so sure?

279
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:10,307
Why am I writing the story
and I can do it as I want.

280
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,008
This, of course,
have a happy ending.

281
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:15,978
But what if I never
arriving in New York ...

282
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:20,782
We should be there at 23h tonight
if the flight leaves on time.

283
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,185
And if no flat tire.

284
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,225
Bored on a trip,
we are using the spare.

285
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,929
More than one hole and we are screwed.

286
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:34,330
- Talk about New York, Martin.
- What do you know?

287
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:38,568
Where you live, to get started.
How is your apartment.

288
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,774
If it is large enough
for both of us.

289
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:48,450
We will have to move furniture,
but has room for two people.

290
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,755
And if not like,
look elsewhere.

291
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:55,021
- I'm afraid, Martin.
- Of course it is, I am also.

292
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,485
This is grace.

293
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,654
We go to a place
where nobody was.

294
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,130
And do not talk of New York.

295
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,304
Are you okay?

296
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:19,078
Yes, I'm fine.

297
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,220
I still have many
to learn about you, is not it?

298
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,322
I have a lot to learn about me.

299
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,760
I hope not to disappoint you, Martin.

300
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,024
I think not. I speak of a flat tire
and then it happens.

301
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,924
Sorry, Martin.

302
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,821
Maybe I'll bring bad luck.

303
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,958
'Sorry'?
Why would you apologize?

304
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,462
It's not your fault.

305
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:30,221
Well, there goes the brake.

306
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:33,156
The brake, no, Martin is a tire.

307
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,087
What will you do?

308
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:45,235
It has a gas station
2 or 3 km from here.

309
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,105
I can walk there in half an hour.

310
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:51,475
Buy a new tire in the shop.
They give me a ride back.

311
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:55,912
- What about me? There I go with you?
- Of course I want.

312
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,711
But it makes no sense you get tired.

313
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,812
I'll be back soon.

314
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,014
Sure, Martin.

315
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,980
Do whatever you think best.

316
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,168
You can sleep
in the car while I go.

317
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,033
Will make the time pass quickly.

318
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,841
Only 45 minutes,
one hour at most.

319
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:25,741
Kiss me again, Martin.

320
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:33,249
Do you love me, no?

321
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,814
What do you think?

322
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,133
Hello?

323
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,087
Yes, I understand.

324
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,760
Goodbye.

325
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:59,463
Only one person had
the post that day.

326
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:02,921
What do you mean there was nobody
to take Martin to the car.

327
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,577
Nice work, Martin.

328
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:12,864
He did not know what to do.

329
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:16,800
If it were to New York, he felt
the connection end for all time.

330
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,766
Maybe Claire had
panicked and changed my mind.

331
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:24,538
If she showed up again,
would be the home of Jack and Diane.

332
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:26,850
It was the only place she knew.

333
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,675
And it was Martin's only hope.

334
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:42,964
Need help?

335
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:47,033
Thanks, I think I can turn.

336
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:50,901
Take your time.
I'm just trying to help, man.

337
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:59,706
'Fortunato Plumbing & Heat.'
You are Jim Fortunato?

338
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,780
- Himself.
- I was going to call you.

339
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,454
The boiler in my house
is not working right.

340
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:06,046
Need of repair.

341
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,926
What is home?
I can not say I've seen here.

342
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,028
I'm just visiting.
The house is Jack Rastall.

343
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:13,758
You must know it.
He told me to call you.

344
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:16,958
Sure, I know Jack.
Why does not he call?

345
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,470
He and Diane are out of the country.
Are in Calcutta.

346
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,835
Calcutta?

347
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:27,277
I once read that the rain
India can be so strong ...

348
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:29,646
the drops are like bullets.
If you are not careful ...

349
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:31,671
you can die if they quit.

350
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,689
Are you taking care of the house?

351
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:42,125
I am a friend, I am in the house,
while they are away.

352
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,462
A friend?
And where are you, friend?

353
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:47,564
- New York.
- New York City?

354
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,054
New York City.

355
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:53,093
- This makes a foreigner, is not it?
- What do you mean?

356
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,874
I once read that New York
is only an island off the coast of Europe.

357
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,244
- Not part of the United States.
- You read a lot, huh?

358
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:04,237
All the time. In all there
in the world, what I like most is reading.

359
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,713
I hope you enjoy
repair of boilers.

360
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,945
I do not care, but is not
what I call passion, you know?

361
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:15,856
- You can go to the house this afternoon?
- Sorry, everything is full today.

362
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:19,796
Tomorrow, it may be.
Some time after 15h.

363
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:23,027
Okay, tomorrow,
some time, after 15h.

364
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:26,333
He spoke, man!
Even more.

365
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:56,491
- Then he went home.
- Claire!

366
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,161
- And the second part of the story begins.
- Claire!

367
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:05,031
Where are you, Claire?

368
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:34,301
Martin? Martin?

369
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:39,331
Are you awake?

370
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,307
Claire?

371
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,974
I can not open.
I'm stuck.

372
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:50,983
Do not worry about the door, Martin.

373
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,491
I just want to make sure you're well.

374
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:58,393
Well? Not good.

375
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:02,524
What happened to you, Claire?
Why did you run away?

376
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,502
I should not have
left me alone, Martin.

377
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,638
What would I do? I could not
go to the airport without a car ...

378
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:10,970
and the car needed
a new tire.

379
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:15,838
They called me back.
I had no choice.

380
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,714
While you were there, they do not
had control over me, but ...

381
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:24,254
when you left
and, again, I could not do anything.

382
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:26,823
But we broke the spell.
I brought you back to life.

383
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:29,348
Once that happened,
I thought it would be free forever.

384
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:33,395
That's what I thought, too.
But I was wrong.

385
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:38,025
- What will happen now?
- I will be punished.

386
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:43,798
- For how long?
- I do not know. Everything is in chaos.

387
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,710
They never faced
a situation like this.

388
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,541
No one knows what to do.

389
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:52,349
They are discussing it
provided that burned its history.

390
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:55,250
Great.
Now, I suffer too.

391
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:58,388
Just because I'm an idiot
not good for anything ...

392
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,481
with a typewriter, not
mean it can not meet them.

393
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:03,622
Why do I want this, Martin?

394
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:09,324
- There are other women in the world.
- I've been with other women, Claire.

395
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,459
So I've been married.

396
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:17,274
You're the first person
I care about ...

397
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,504
more than myself.

398
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,545
It's simple.

399
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:51,608
The next morning, Martin decided
write down everything you remember ...

400
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,838
time spent with Claire.

401
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,980
If he concentrated
enough in the past ...

402
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,949
perhaps understand
what to do at present.

403
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:20,423
I arrived early?
That came later?

404
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,550
No, the time is great.

405
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:26,196
No need to show me the way.
I've been here several times.

406
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:27,897
- Need Help?
- Do not worry.

407
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:30,331
I know the best boiler
my own mother.

408
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,759
That's because I am an orphan.

409
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:56,056
Here is your money.

410
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:00,553
You're a writer.
With novels published.

411
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,397
It is what it seems.

412
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,825
Martin Frost and Martin Frost.

413
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,439
I thought I
something familiar to you.

414
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,074
He could not remember
where he had seen.

415
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:13,235
Will not say that you have read my work?

416
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:17,873
I could lie and say yes,
but I heard about you.

417
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:21,676
- At least it's something.
- More than 'something'!

418
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:26,147
Sorry my face in amazement,
but I'm surprised.

419
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:32,562
Restrain yourself, Mr. Fortunato, will pass.

420
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:35,198
No, seriously. I am a writer.

421
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:37,826
Not published anything,
but also write.

422
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:40,537
What sort of things do you write?

423
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:43,840
Stories, mostly. Tales.
All kinds of history.

424
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:48,777
Science fiction, horror,
police, political, erotic.

425
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:52,206
As can be as creative
and have a business at the same time?

426
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,146
Energy, Mr. Frost.

427
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:58,555
By day, I get
the pipes, toilets, boilers ...

428
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:01,615
but at night,
I walk in my imagination.

429
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,127
You'd be surprised how
what a man can do ...

430
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:06,357
only when sleeping
two or three hours a night.

431
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:11,559
Give time to live two lives.
Be two men in one body.

432
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:16,002
What is the secret?
If I sleep so little, I faint.

433
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:19,867
Passion, ambition, desire.

434
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:32,448
- I do not want to take advantage, Mr. Frost ...
- You can call me Martin.

435
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:36,417
- Marty did not?
- Martin.

436
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:39,989
Sure, Martin.

437
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:43,890
Call me Jim.
No more 'Mr. Fortunato '.

438
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:49,134
- All right, Jim. I was saying ...
- Yes

439
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:53,943
Do not want to take advantage of you,
Martin, but I wonder ...

440
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:58,607
have the time to
take a quick look ...

441
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:00,617
in some of my production.

442
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:03,386
I do not know if my opinion
worth that much, but, of course.

443
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:06,822
Why not?
Can I get a pleasant surprise.

444
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:25,066
- How long does this happen?
- Years, Martin, many years.

445
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:27,668
But you're my first writer.

446
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:31,147
I used to be sent
for painters and musicians.

447
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:34,913
But there was a terrible incident
and I was transferred.

448
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:37,954
- What happened?
- Last year, in Paris ...

449
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:42,358
a painter named Philippe Ponge
hanged himself in the studio. 5939

450
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:44,349
I remember reading about it.

451
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:48,862
- It was because of you?
- It was not my fault.

452
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:51,501
I was his model, not his mistress.

453
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:53,901
When the frame was ready,
had to leave.

454
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:57,067
Whenever I'm gone
when the work is finished.

455
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:02,409
He could not handle it.
And a month later, he killed himself.

456
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:05,982
- I know how he felt.
- Do not be silly ideas, Martin.

457
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:09,850
I fight for us every day.
The story is not over yet.

458
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,817
What if I break down the door?

459
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:16,117
And if your hand caught
and pulled into the room?

460
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:19,395
There's no point. At the moment
he stepped into the hallway ...

461
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:22,887
I would not be there anymore.
The dream would end.

462
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:27,993
I do not know more
How long stand this, Claire.

463
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:33,241
They are arguing about what
do with me. There is so much confusion.

464
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:37,305
They are beginning to make mistakes.
Joining women with the wrong men.

465
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:41,544
- Men with the wrong women.
- Men with the wrong men.

466
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:44,547
Not to mention women
with the wrong women.

467
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,216
Actually, yes.

468
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:51,221
- And?
- I do not know.

469
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:54,464
But if we help them
to clean up the mess ...

470
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:56,830
maybe we can
make a deal with them.

471
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:01,029
Wait. How can I help?

472
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:05,801
I do not know, Martin.
Time will tell.

473
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,082
Martin felt that
things were changing.

474
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:27,560
The more he wrote about Claire
its presence felt more at home.

475
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,733
He was not a person
I believed in ghosts.

476
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:34,804
He was always a rational person.
But there were times when podiajurar ...

477
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:37,136
felt that breathing at his side.

478
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:41,370
The words he wrote about it
were to bring back?

479
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:44,607
Martin was afraid to think that.

480
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:47,382
He was not allowed more
to hope.

481
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:51,117
But without hope,
that was still in the house?

482
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:54,087
Why was still
writing the story?

483
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:34,415
It is a good time?
Or is it a bad time?

484
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:38,856
I did not want to overwhelm you,
so I decided to bring only three ...

485
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:42,256
you can call sample
representative of my work.

486
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:45,668
This is called
'The Little People of Lastman.'

487
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:48,137
Lastman is a republic
fictitious in Central Europe ...

488
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:50,640
hidden in the Carpathian Mountains.

489
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,201
Population: 3.5 million.
Main production: Potato.

490
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:59,182
One day, the harvest is not enough
and famine spreads throughout the country.

491
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:02,785
Dr. Anatol Karpac,
the chief scientist of Lastman ...

492
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:05,686
goes to the President
with a plan to save the country.

493
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:10,093
The problem is:
Little food, many people.

494
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:12,493
There are not enough resources.

495
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:16,599
Karpac analyzed the situation
and the conclusion is ...

496
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:18,968
the inhabitants are very large.

497
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:22,472
I'm talking about the bodies.
Their bodies are very large.

498
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:24,574
They need a lot of
food to sustain them e. ..

499
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:28,811
as there is not enough,
he invented a pill ...

500
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:32,770
that shrinks people to
a third of its original size.

501
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:37,320
Just take a pill and
a man is 1.82 m with 60cm.

502
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,723
1.82 If a man needs
of potatoes in 9 days ...

503
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:43,092
then need a 60cm
only three, right?

504
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,458
There are enough resources.

505
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,399
- Incredible.
- It is actually an allegory ...

506
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:52,769
about the environmental crisis
in the world today.

507
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,403
We are destroying the planet
because of greed.

508
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:59,475
Because everyone wants too.
Many cars, many plants ...

509
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:01,677
many washing machines.

510
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:04,781
The only way to save
the planet is to think small.

511
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,749
About what are the other stories?

512
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,952
This is called 'Fuck off, asshole. "

513
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,388
Where the hero is a detective
Sharpless named Don.

514
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:16,425
It is a classic tough guys.
Dialogues fast. Very sophisticated.

515
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:19,690
- And the third?
- This is the newest.

516
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:24,362
I finished last night and
must be the best thing I ever did.

517
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:27,325
'Bushataque'.
This is the title.

518
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:29,903
What do you think
as the first sentence?

519
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:35,737
'It was the morning of the third
possession of George W. Bush. '

520
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:40,850
Promising.

521
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:45,685
'Bushataque'. Got it?
Bush attack.

522
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:49,158
The story is about a conspiracy
to kill the bastard ...

523
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,785
that self-proclaimed
our president.

524
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,558
- You do not like the old George?
- I despise the damned.

525
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:59,068
He is a dangerous liar
and did more to destroy America ...

526
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:01,103
that any man in history.

527
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:03,970
I did not know he had a Democrat
here in these parts.

528
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:07,940
Democrat? Who's a Democrat?
I also hate those disgusting.

529
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:12,641
Vote the Socialist Party.
I am 100% trostkista.

530
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:17,720
- One of the last.
- Permanent Revolution, Martin.

531
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,789
It is the only answer
to the problems of the world.

532
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:22,358
- And 'think small'?
- I was talking about ...

533
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,660
over natural resources.
When it comes to politics ...

534
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,863
you have to think big.
I'm leaving you bored.

535
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:30,321
No, no, no. Not at all
I'm just a little tired, that's all.

536
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:33,765
If you want my opinion,
you are very down.

537
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:37,469
Are you a sad look, Martin.

538
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:41,675
I finished a novel three weeks ago.

539
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:45,045
I always take some
months to recover.

540
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,343
So, is not
writing anything at the moment?

541
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:53,714
A little.

542
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,918
I'm taking notes.

543
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:00,352
Getting ready for the next step.

544
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:05,657
So you get this great old house,
alone, no one to talk?

545
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:08,169
That's why we get depressed.

546
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:10,729
What you need
is a little distracting.

547
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,269
Maybe.

548
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:16,138
Ever heard of
'Screwdriver Darts'?

549
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:21,083
- 'Screwdriver Darts'?
- It's a game that Jack and I invented.

550
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:24,921
It's great fun, Martin.
Maybe I will one day teach.

551
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,822
As a thank you
for reading my stuff.

552
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:46,022
Hi, Martin. Ready for fun?

553
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:48,421
Beautiful clothes.

554
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:52,595
The official uniform
of 'Darts Screwdriver'.

555
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:56,939
You mean Jack
have one of these too?

556
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:59,499
You bet.
But his is white.

557
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:02,378
I hope you do not mind
I refuse this pleasure ...

558
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:04,403
and stay with my
own clothes.

559
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,540
No problem.
As you wish.

560
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:12,448
These are the Jack.
He will not mind if you use.

561
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:20,529
Let me guess.
The goal is to hit the target.

562
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:21,964
Exactly.

563
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:24,800
There are 40 points to the red in the middle,
20 points for the Blue ...

564
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:28,237
10 points for white
and 5 points for the yellow.

565
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:29,772
The first to arrive
to 100 points wins.

566
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,605
- We played the game for $ 50.
- $ 50?

567
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:35,945
You and Jack lead
this thing seriously, eh?

568
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,380
- If there is no risk, no fun.
- Where do you stand?

569
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,211
Here, behind this line.

570
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:45,054
- It's a bit far, is not it?
- There are darts common, Martin.

571
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:47,356
Are 'Screwdriver Darts' and
to make a screwdriver ...

572
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:51,884
into that target,
you have to play with great force.

573
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:58,792
- Impressive.
- I'm just warming up.

574
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:00,963
Why do not you try?

575
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:03,706
- Secure the blade or the cable?
- For the blade.

576
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,674
You get a
better balance as well.

577
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:08,642
Only about half
between the line and the target.

578
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,614
A star is born!

579
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:22,824
- You have talent, Martin.
- Very proud.

580
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:24,915
Think you're ready
for a game?

581
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,594
Why not?

582
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:51,579
I'm sorry, Martin.

583
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:55,255
After primeirajogada,
I thought it would fare much better.

584
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:58,561
Beginner's luck.
Then it was how I actually play.

585
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:02,156
- I hate to take money from you.
- Forget it. You won, I lost.

586
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:05,968
- It's fair.
- But $ 500 is too much.

587
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:07,770
Particularly after
of everything you did for me.

588
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:09,939
I did not do anything for you.

589
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:12,708
I know I have not read
my stories, but will read.

590
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:15,472
You are a man of his word
and will not let me down.

591
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,774
Let's go, I will check.

592
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:23,649
I know. I'll leave
you stay with my niece.

593
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:26,121
His niece?
What are you talking about?

594
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:29,488
I do not think right pick
all this money without giving you something.

595
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:33,395
Still do not understand what
this has to do with his niece.

596
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,264
She is 18 and does not work.

597
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:38,461
She can cook for you,
cleaning house, washing clothes.

598
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:41,067
I would like to offer you this
in exchange for money.

599
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:43,772
It is very gentle, Jim,
but I better not.

600
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:47,037
With her around, you will no longer
be alone in this house.

601
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:49,302
But I like being alone.

602
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:52,274
I want to be alone.

603
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:25,580
PEOPLE OF SMALL Lastman.
FORTUNATO JAMES

604
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:31,146
There was nothing else to write,
nothing else to think.

605
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,454
All he
could do was wait.

606
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:37,815
Or give up,
pack up and leave.

607
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:31,380
- You again?
- I'm going to the governor's mansion ...

608
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:35,551
And I wanted you to see me before.
Elegant, no?

609
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:37,720
- Governor's Mansion?
- A few months ago ...

610
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:41,490
I saved a girl from drowning.
Maggie Fitsons.

611
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:45,127
Perhaps he saw in the newspaper.
Now, I get the medal ...

612
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:48,494
- For heroism and bravery.
- Who is she?

613
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:51,289
Not that way, stupid.
Enter the house.

614
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:55,871
- My niece, Anna.
- I thought I had spoken ...

615
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:59,742
I know, I know. But when he said
what was here yesterday ...

616
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:02,939
she said she wanted to meet you,
would not take no for an answer.

617
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:07,249
- Talk 'hi' to Martin.
- Hi, Martin.

618
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:08,682
Hi, Anna.

619
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:11,753
Squeeze his hand, dizzy.

620
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,093
Now, sit on the couch.

621
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:24,958
What's wrong with her?
She looks half dead.

622
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:29,338
It is a sad story, Martin.
She appeared at my door ...

623
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:32,574
there are nine months,
with nothing but their clothes.

624
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:36,979
Homeless, penniless.
It had to house it, no?

625
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:39,248
What happened?
She fled the country?

626
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,842
That's the problem.
She has no parents.

627
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:45,053
My sister and her husband, Al James,
died in a car crash ...

628
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:46,782
in Oregon last year.

629
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:52,958
Are you saying that her last name
is like your first name?

630
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:57,454
Yeah, so?
It's just a coincidence.

631
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,171
When was the last time you saw
before they appear in your home?

632
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:06,039
A long time ago.
She had no more than 2, 3 years.

633
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:09,006
My sister and I
were not very close.

634
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:12,411
How do you know that Anna is his niece?

635
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:17,714
Of course it is my niece.
Why else would come up to me?

636
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:23,789
I do not think it is
a real person, Jim.

637
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,628
- What are you talking about?
- She is ...

638
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:31,732
a spirit.

639
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:34,497
A ghost.

640
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:42,476
You're crazy, Martin.

641
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:45,280
This is the craziest thing I've ever heard.

642
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,976
When he began
to write their stories?

643
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:53,255
- I do not know, about a year, I think.
- But you did not take seriously ...

644
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:56,019
Anna to begin
to live with you, right?

645
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:01,663
I thought you were
an intelligent person, Martin.

646
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,732
I came behind you,
wanted to be your friend ...

647
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:06,394
but what is
saying now is a nonsense.

648
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:10,503
Look at her.
Call it spirit?

649
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:17,679
She is a human being of flesh and bone.
And a real bore.

650
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,649
When she started living with me
she weighed 72.5 kg.

651
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:23,385
Now, look at her.
You look like a toothpick.

652
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:26,522
She barely eats, barely speaks to me ...

653
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:30,359
and never showed the least amount of gratitude
that I have received it.

654
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,293
Not a word of gratitude.

655
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:34,661
Lift, pea brain.

656
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:38,456
Now give me a slap in the face.

657
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:42,905
See? She likes it.
She likes to hurt me.

658
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:45,707
If you do not want to get slapped,
so do not ask her.

659
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:49,978
I'm just showing how it is.
That's it, she is an idiot.

660
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:52,208
She can barely read and write.

661
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:55,910
You can see how
she takes good care of herself.

662
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:04,386
But, believe it or not,
she has an angelic voice.

663
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:08,193
Take the hair from her face.

664
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:13,298
Sing one of your songs.

665
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:20,242
I am the girl you can see

666
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:24,713
I'm the girl that can not be

667
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:30,419
With my heart I sail the sea

668
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:36,425
And where love beginning to end

669
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:42,497
I go to China, London
In Rio, France

670
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:48,103
I live life
And dance the dance

671
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:53,909
And if you come with me

672
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:59,648
I do not give you another chance, friend

673
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:04,820
For I am the girl
You could not see

674
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:11,157
For I am the girl
That could not be

675
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:19,267
- How did you learn to sing well?
- I do not know.

676
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:23,305
I woke up one day and could not.

677
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:25,741
She can sing
and also know how to interpret.

678
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:27,766
Make one of your monologues for Martin.

679
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:37,978
'Lord Bassanio, as well as
you see me now, I am.

680
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:43,258
For myself, would not be
ambitious in my wish ...

681
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:45,988
want to be much better at all.

682
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:50,193
But triple wished twenty times,
for you, what I am ...

683
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:55,836
be a thousand times more beautiful,
ten thousand times more woman ...

684
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:59,833
a rich heritage.
For your concept to be higher ...

685
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:03,345
wanted to have
invaluable account of virtues ...

686
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:07,714
beauty, wealth and friends. '

687
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:13,747
Portia,
'The Merchant of Venice', right?

688
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:16,655
Excellent.

689
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:19,795
Wow, I gotta go.
The reception starts at 18h ...

690
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:21,530
and have a long way to go.

691
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,794
Come on, Anna,
I take you home.

692
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:25,866
I want to stay with Martin.

693
01:18:25,934 --> 01:18:28,403
I'll cook and clean for him,
as you said I would.

694
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:30,839
But Martin does not want a cook.
I've said it.

695
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:33,637
I do not mind.
I like it here.

696
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:36,278
- And I like Martin.
- Come on, you fool, that's enough.

697
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:40,578
I changed my mind, Jim.
She can stay if you want.

698
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:42,975
At least for now.

699
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:47,516
Let's give her some day,
to see how things turn out.

700
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:57,893
- Where are you from, Anna?
- The home of Jim.

701
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:01,999
Before that.
Before coming to him.

702
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:04,669
I do not remember.

703
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:07,899
It rained a lot.

704
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:10,444
- Oregon?
- Maybe.

705
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:14,672
- They never told me.
- They? Who are they?

706
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,111
The people with whom I lived.

707
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:23,722
That's funny.
I can not see them.

708
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:28,293
How old are you, Anna?

709
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:32,122
I do not know for sure.

710
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:36,769
Sometimes I think I just born.

711
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:39,396
There are 10 minutes.

712
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:42,737
You know what I mean?

713
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:51,887
- Promises to give you food when you eat?
- Yes, I promise.

714
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:54,723
Right. What will you do now ...

715
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:57,988
is to go to the end of the corridor
and bathing.

716
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,262
Go to the bigger room.

717
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:03,498
It has women's clothes in the closet
put whatever you want.

718
01:20:03,498 --> 01:20:06,626
- Right? Think you can do this?
- I think so.

719
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:09,732
If something goes wrong,
just give a shout.

720
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:13,204
Like this? Help! Help!

721
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,836
Exactly.
Just like that.

722
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:32,456
Hello, Anna.
Shall I help you?

723
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:36,258
- Who are you?
- My name is Claire.

724
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:40,569
- I'm here because of Martin.
- I do not understand.

725
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:43,834
Do not worry.
I'll explain everything.

726
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:57,475
Look at you.

727
01:20:58,486 --> 01:21:00,589
That's what I call progress.

728
01:21:00,589 --> 01:21:03,752
Thank you.
I could not alone.

729
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:07,055
- What do you mean?
- Claire helped me.

730
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:10,398
She is a very nice person.

731
01:21:10,398 --> 01:21:13,367
- Where is she?
- You want to see it?

732
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:15,369
Of course I want to see it.

733
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:21,209
Sorry, I should not have said that.
What I meant was ...

734
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:23,177
you want to talk to her?

735
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:27,443
- Is there a difference?
- You can not look at it.

736
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:30,845
If you look, it disappears
and not go back.

737
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:35,186
I screwed the same things, no?

738
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:40,024
What you have to do
is uncovered eyes with this scarf.

739
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:43,326
So, it will be able to speak
with it as you want.

740
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:55,869
- Can I touch it?
- I guess I'm not sure.

741
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:59,744
Of course you can touch me, Martin.

742
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:08,620
You can even kiss me if you want.

743
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:11,124
- Where are you?
- Right here, Martin.

744
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:25,507
It was the best I could do.
Nobody wanted to stay.

745
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:28,843
It is unprecedented and they
did not know how to handle it.

746
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:31,212
I do not understand
why can not I look at you.

747
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:35,808
Because I belong to you, Martin.
To you and nobody else.

748
01:22:36,318 --> 01:22:39,821
During the time that is
caught between here and there ...

749
01:22:39,821 --> 01:22:42,449
they said
will be so for a year.

750
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:45,888
And what happens
when that time runs out?

751
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:50,098
If all goes well, you will be able to
look at me again.

752
01:22:50,098 --> 01:22:52,498
This was the condition.

753
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:55,270
Are not always clear
as could be.

754
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:58,637
And how do you define 'work out'?

755
01:22:58,873 --> 01:23:00,942
To begin with,
you have to take care of Anna.

756
01:23:00,942 --> 01:23:03,274
It was how I managed to convince them.

757
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:05,547
She was sent here by mistake,
was not ready ...

758
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:10,318
and now need education,
must learn to be a person.

759
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:13,288
But living with Anna Fortunato,
he thinks is his niece.

760
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:16,424
I think Mr. Fortunato
will not object.

761
01:23:16,424 --> 01:23:19,450
- No?
- No.

762
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:22,863
He is a horrible writer, is not it?

763
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:25,021
I think so.

764
01:23:26,368 --> 01:23:27,801
Poor girl.

765
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:30,572
That's why we have to do
all we can for her.

766
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:34,565
We have to undo the damage. So
can go back and start all over again.

767
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:37,702
This is getting complicated.

768
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:39,604
What else?

769
01:23:40,882 --> 01:23:44,477
No sex.
No sex for a year.

770
01:23:45,086 --> 01:23:48,757
- Not to sell?
- No, Martin.

771
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:50,918
Only in your dreams.

772
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,994
But there are dreams.

773
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:57,555
Are real.

774
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,667
I think you're all set.

775
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:21,156
I wanted to be with us.
Makes no sense you get.

776
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:24,926
I can not go now.
But I find you in New York later.

777
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:28,696
- When?
- Soon, I promise.

778
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:32,188
- I do not want to leave you again.
- But need.

779
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:35,131
I wish I could go now, too,
I can not.

780
01:24:53,154 --> 01:24:55,213
- Bye, Anna.
- Bye.

781
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:59,252
One more kiss.

782
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:02,619
Drive carefully, Martin.

783
01:25:11,339 --> 01:25:15,503
- Claire, are you back there?
- Yes, Martin.

784
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:23,184
As I drive to the airport
eyes with a handkerchief?

785
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:24,879
Tire.

786
01:25:25,153 --> 01:25:28,523
But if you take, you will see and
then you lose.

787
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:33,222
It will not.
I wish it were a surprise.

788
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:36,493
Mirrors do not count.

789
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:40,459
- Are you sure?
- Absolute.

790
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:55,177
- Hello, Claire.
- Hello, Martin.

791
01:26:27,615 --> 01:26:30,518
- Why not sing a song, Anna?
- What do you hear?

792
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:33,188
- Something slow and sad
busy and funny or something?

793
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:36,282
- Whatever you want.
- Exciting and funny.

794
01:26:37,392 --> 01:26:43,598
I went south to see Salt
Singing Polly Wolly Doodle all day

795
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:49,270
She is a brave girl
Singing Polly Wolly Doodle all day

796
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:54,943
Bye, bye
Goodbye my beautiful fairy

797
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:57,612
I go to Louisiana
See my Susyanna

798
01:26:57,612 --> 01:27:00,513
Singing Polly Wolly Doodle all day
