MAN: Thousands of years ago
in ancient China,

2
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:43,505
an evil army
of shadow warriors...

3
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:46,167
terrorized the great city
of Shang-sa.

4
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:47,904
To save his people,

5
00:00:47,944 --> 00:00:52,438
the good king sacrificed himself
to create a mystical medallion.

6
00:00:53,115 --> 00:00:56,414
Realizing the ultimate powers
of the medallion,

7
00:00:56,452 --> 00:00:58,477
the king split it in half.

8
00:00:58,521 --> 00:01:02,252
To one son,
he gave the power over body;

9
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,885
to the other,
power over the soul.

10
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:09,088
This is the legend
of the Double Dragon.

his sons would be triumphant...

and return peace to the land.

17
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:28,659
After their victory, the princes
hid the medallions...

18
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:32,504
to prevent them
from ever being used...for evil.

Over the centuries,
many lives have been spent...

25
00:04:01,303 --> 00:04:03,567

the legendary Double Dragon.

Uh, you go ahead.
l'll watch the truck.

179
00:17:17,632 --> 00:17:21,124
-So what's the plan?
-l'm working out the details.

180
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:29,903
Hey, broomhead!

181
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:31,845
We'll sweep the floor
with your skull!

182
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,541
[Growling]

183
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:36,050
ABOBO: Huh?
HAWK: Oh, oh.

184
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:53,560
Let's get out of here.

185
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:58,336
-Ha! Last of the Mohicans.
-Oh.

186
00:17:58,974 --> 00:18:03,968
BlLLY: Run, you little Tontos.
Go on. Shoo! Shoo!

187
00:18:06,081 --> 00:18:08,072
BlLLY: Oh, great.
The Power Corp.

188
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:15,489
Team Lee. Need any help?

189
00:18:16,124 --> 00:18:18,285
-Not from you, Marian.
-Yeah, Marian.

190
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:19,657
ls that so?

191
00:18:19,694 --> 00:18:20,922
BlLLY: Yeah.
JlMMY: Yeah.

192
00:18:21,463 --> 00:18:23,328
[Murmuring]

193
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:25,731
MARlAN: Always the tough guy,
huh, Jimmy?

194
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:28,468
You're not worth saving.

195
00:18:29,204 --> 00:18:31,069
We came for this.

196
00:18:34,676 --> 00:18:36,803
lt's a Gangnet link-up.

197
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:40,804
lt gives us data on the gangs
that are destroying our city.

198
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:43,977
Marian, the mother of all quakes
did most of the destroying.

199
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:46,385
The Power Corp
could use you guys.

200
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:49,356
We could help each other.
What do you say?

201
00:18:49,391 --> 00:18:51,689
JlMMY: You break curfew nightly.

202
00:18:51,726 --> 00:18:54,786
You're as law-abiding
as the gangs. Right?

203
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:57,898
Wha...heck, no.

204
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:01,366
Marian's doing a tremendous
service for our city.

205
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:05,734
What a butt-kiss.

206
00:19:05,774 --> 00:19:07,571
Hey, guys, let's fly.

207
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:09,634
They'll be back
with reinforcements.

208
00:19:17,352 --> 00:19:19,377
[Yelling]

209
00:19:25,193 --> 00:19:28,219
JlMMY: lt's time you told us
about the dragon.

210
00:19:28,396 --> 00:19:31,923
SATORl: Your father was in the
excavation when it collapsed.

211
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:37,336
He gave this to me
in Shang-sa...with a warning.

212
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,868
He said the powers of the dragon
are too dangerous...

213
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,003
for one person to possess.

214
00:19:45,947 --> 00:19:50,043
When he died,
l made a promise to myself.

215
00:19:51,252 --> 00:19:55,211
That l'd look after you two
and the medallion.

216
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:05,227
Doesn't look dangerous.

217
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,358
l broke it in half.

218
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:12,501
l kept one piece with me
and hid the other.

219
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,539
Jimmy's underwear?

220
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:19,273
Listen to me.

221
00:20:20,081 --> 00:20:23,175
The medallion acts as
a spiritual amplifier.

222
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:26,119
lt magnifies the power
inside you.

223
00:20:26,154 --> 00:20:28,418
This half gives power
over the body.

224
00:20:28,456 --> 00:20:30,651
The other half gives power
over the soul.

225
00:20:30,692 --> 00:20:34,594
Legend says it can transform
a man into a ghost...

226
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:36,756
and give him strength of steel.

227
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:44,571
Power of body...
and strength of steel?

228
00:20:46,274 --> 00:20:47,741
Where's the "on" button?

229
00:20:49,444 --> 00:20:52,106
To use it now
would put us in danger.

230
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:56,981
Dark forces know
of its existence.

231
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,117
lt's been the source
of much death and destruction.

232
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:06,992
lt is our responsibility
to protect the dragon.

233
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,730
lt's best to let it sleep.

234
00:21:17,338 --> 00:21:21,536
COMPUTER: Billy Lee, age 17.

235
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:23,476

Deville Theater.

238

Fourth-degree black...

239
00:21:33,455 --> 00:21:36,891
How was l supposed to know?
lt looked like cheap jewelry.

240
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:38,415
COMPUTER: Jimmy Lee...

241
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,258
SHUKO: The power of
the second dragon calls me.

242
00:21:41,296 --> 00:21:44,094
They'll surrender it or die.

243
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:46,793
Lash!

244
00:21:46,835 --> 00:21:48,063
COMPUTER: Satori lmada--

245
00:21:48,837 --> 00:21:50,828
You know better than that.

246
00:21:50,872 --> 00:21:53,102
Not until l have my shades on.

247
00:21:56,311 --> 00:22:01,943
Once the medallions are mine,
so then will be New Angeles.

248
00:22:04,152 --> 00:22:06,518
l've always wanted my own city.

249
00:22:08,256 --> 00:22:11,248
Now...as for you, Mr. Abobo--

250
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:14,227
Lash should have put out an APB
on that medallion.

251
00:22:14,262 --> 00:22:15,593
lt's her fault.

252
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,431
Nobody likes a tattletale.

253
00:22:45,093 --> 00:22:47,357
SHUKO: Your incompetence
sticks needles...

254
00:22:47,395 --> 00:22:49,363
in the flesh of my honor.

255
00:22:51,165 --> 00:22:53,827
Think of this
as similar punishment.

256
00:22:56,104 --> 00:23:00,404
My engineering firm
created this, my pin cushion.

257
00:23:01,843 --> 00:23:04,573
Sudden molecular steroids.

258
00:23:04,612 --> 00:23:06,842
You'll have the strength
of 10 men.

259
00:23:07,782 --> 00:23:11,115
l have the strength of 10 men.
This will kill me.

260
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:15,351
Perhaps. l consider you
like a son, Abobo.

261
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,723
Like a son,
l can always have another.

262
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,890
However, there's only
one Double Dragon.

263
00:23:23,765 --> 00:23:25,733
Please, have a seat.

264
00:23:32,373 --> 00:23:35,706
Yah!

265
00:23:35,743 --> 00:23:38,234
Once again,
Madonna's in the news.

266
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:40,679
She held a press conference
in Old York.

267
00:23:40,715 --> 00:23:44,014
She said her marriage
to Tom Arnold is finished.

268
00:23:44,052 --> 00:23:45,519
She's moving to Paris.

269
00:23:45,553 --> 00:23:49,956
The ex-pop superstar said
simply, she wants to be alone.

270
00:23:49,991 --> 00:23:51,322
lt's tragic, isn't it?

271
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,154
Vice president Jerry Brown was
in Bangladesh this week...

272
00:23:55,196 --> 00:23:56,959
attending the funeral
of Chairman Khan.

273
00:23:56,998 --> 00:24:00,126
Next week, he'll attend
the funeral of ambassador...

about your hair.

HAMlLTON: A plane
containing medical supplies...

283
00:24:28,963 --> 00:24:30,157
exploded last night.

284
00:24:30,198 --> 00:24:33,429
Authorities believe
it's the work of the Power Corp.

285
00:24:33,468 --> 00:24:34,696
Damn Power Corp.

286
00:24:34,736 --> 00:24:37,637
MARlAN: Setup. The plane was
probably filled with drugs.

287
00:24:37,672 --> 00:24:40,800
-What do you know?
-l know that the Power Corp...

288
00:24:40,842 --> 00:24:43,538

terrorizing the city.

289

-That's what l know.
-Marian, don't start.

290
00:24:47,782 --> 00:24:50,080
At least l got the guns
off the street.

291
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:54,651
You should have seen it
when everybody had an Uzi.

292
00:24:54,689 --> 00:24:57,522
Dad, please.
Not the Uzi story again.

293
00:24:57,558 --> 00:24:59,856
Marian, you were too young
to remember...

294
00:24:59,894 --> 00:25:01,691
what it was like
after the quakes.

295
00:25:01,729 --> 00:25:04,789
Floods, power outages,
gas leaks all over,

296
00:25:04,832 --> 00:25:06,424
and no help from the Feds.

297
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:09,698
When we looked up
from the debris, ahh...

298
00:25:09,737 --> 00:25:11,364
the gangs ran the city.

299
00:25:11,673 --> 00:25:14,301
Yeah. They still do, Dad,
every night!

300
00:25:15,843 --> 00:25:18,038
One thing l learned from Mom...

301
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,808
is to fight for
what you believe in.

302
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:22,748
At least the days are safe,
Marian.

303
00:25:22,784 --> 00:25:26,618
lf that's not enough for you,
try being a cop sometime.

304
00:25:26,654 --> 00:25:30,215
So l could learn to compromise
with thugs? No, thanks.

305
00:25:30,258 --> 00:25:32,522
The Power Corp doesn't just
clean the mess in the morning;

306
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,686
they fight.

307
00:25:33,728 --> 00:25:36,925
CHlEF:
The Power Corp are terrorists.

308
00:25:52,313 --> 00:25:53,712
BlLLY: That was pretty good.

309
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:57,745
The problem with you is
you don't understand physics.

00:25:57,852 --> 00:25:59,752
Two hands! Hang on to me!

311
00:25:59,787 --> 00:26:02,950
They call it martial arts,
not martial science.

312
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,356
-Like you'd know the difference.
-l would.

SATORl: You guys
are doing great...just great.

Geisman.

320
00:26:27,181 --> 00:26:30,514
No one has called me Geisman
for many years.

321
00:26:31,586 --> 00:26:34,487
But like a phoenix
rising from the ashes,

322
00:26:34,522 --> 00:26:36,319
l have ascended.

323
00:26:36,357 --> 00:26:38,154
l've taken a new name,

324
00:26:38,192 --> 00:26:41,184
that of the great,
ancient Japanese warlord.

325
00:26:41,229 --> 00:26:43,959
l am Koga Shuko.

326
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:48,935
SATORl: You...you're Shuko?

327
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,460
l'm afraid so.

328
00:26:51,506 --> 00:26:55,704
You see, Satori, no one wants
to party with Victor Geisman.

329
00:26:56,511 --> 00:27:00,971
Now, l believe you have
something that belongs to me.

330
00:27:01,015 --> 00:27:04,246
You ask so politely...Geisman.

331
00:27:06,854 --> 00:27:09,652
-Just give me the medallion.
-l think not.

332
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,282
l put continents
between the medallions...

333
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:13,555
to keep them away from you.

334
00:27:13,594 --> 00:27:15,391
l'd hoped you wouldn't find me.

335
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:16,828
lt hardly matters.

336
00:27:17,598 --> 00:27:20,829

-You got it.

530
00:47:59,172 --> 00:48:00,935
Whoa!

531
00:48:25,398 --> 00:48:26,558
Whoa!

532

MAN ON P.A.: ...on the corner
of Sunset and Vine.

534
00:49:05,305 --> 00:49:08,900
Now for the highlight
of your Hollywood river tour,

535
00:49:08,942 --> 00:49:14,938
we're now approaching the world
famous Mann's Chinese Theatre!

536
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:18,679
BlLLY: l think we lost one.

537
00:49:32,365 --> 00:49:33,957
This river's flammable!

538
00:49:39,205 --> 00:49:40,297
We're cooked!

539
00:49:54,454 --> 00:49:55,716
Whoa!

00:49:59,092 --> 00:50:00,389
Yeah, come on, Jimmy!

541
00:50:41,968 --> 00:50:44,232
Send in the divers
for the medallion.

542
00:50:49,008 --> 00:50:50,202
-Blech!

[Coughing and gagging]

544
00:50:52,278 --> 00:50:56,044
This water's gross.
Needs a seat and lid over it.

Exactly. lt's time
to take the fight to Shuko.

550
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:24,266
The Hollywood river caught fire
once again today.

551
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:26,278
When the police went
to investigate,

552
00:51:26,312 --> 00:51:29,975
they were attacked in
broad daylight by gang members.

553
00:51:30,016 --> 00:51:32,382
Here we see footage
from our cop-cams,

554
00:51:32,418 --> 00:51:36,980
as gangs attacked the police,
chanting, "The truce is over."

555
00:51:37,023 --> 00:51:41,483
This is the first daylight
gang attack in seven years.

556
00:51:41,527 --> 00:51:44,121
Let's go now live
to police headquarters.

557

Chief Delario, Sam Gilespi,
102 News.

558
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,960
Why aggravate the gangs?

559
00:51:49,002 --> 00:51:51,436
WOMAN: What will you do?
They have rights, too.

560
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:53,632

are misunderstood.

562
00:51:55,675 --> 00:51:58,075
GlLESPl: Why did gangs
break the truce?

563
00:51:58,111 --> 00:52:01,774
You realize that it's
23 minutes till sundown?

564
00:52:02,749 --> 00:52:04,842
MAN: l'm gone.
GlLESPl: That's a wrap.

565
00:52:13,259 --> 00:52:18,595
SHUKO: OK, how hard can it be to
pull my dragon from the river?

566
00:52:18,631 --> 00:52:20,155
l mean, it's down there!

567
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:21,496
The river's really deep.

568
00:52:21,534 --> 00:52:23,024
Damn kids!

569
00:52:24,537 --> 00:52:27,529

Huh?

575
00:52:44,724 --> 00:52:47,852
lt's a bad career move, boys.
Bad career move.

576
00:52:48,494 --> 00:52:50,155
Time for plan B.

577

BlLLY: We can't take Shuko
by ourselves. We need help.

587
00:53:24,764 --> 00:53:26,163
JlMMY: The Power Corp?

588
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:28,827
l can't believe
you'd ask Marian for help.

589
00:53:28,868 --> 00:53:32,360
BlLLY: We'll go to the police.

590
00:53:32,405 --> 00:53:34,532
They'll believe
this medallion thing.

"You see, Officer,
we've got this magic medallion.

l don't think so.

595
00:53:47,453 --> 00:53:51,287
The way to stop Shuko is to get
his half of the medallion.

596
00:53:51,324 --> 00:53:53,019
For that, we need help.

597
00:53:53,059 --> 00:53:55,755
JlMMY: l won't ask Marian.

598
00:53:55,795 --> 00:53:57,695

This is it.

614
00:54:51,684 --> 00:54:55,848
Now for the last time,
why is Shuko uniting them?

00:54:55,888 --> 00:54:58,288
l told you everything l--

616
00:54:58,324 --> 00:55:00,849
He used you!
Why are you protecting him?

l need to get into
Shuko's headquarters, OK?

618
00:55:04,931 --> 00:55:07,491

Abobo being there.

No, you wouldn't.
He's as big as a house.

Shuko did some sort
of experiment on him.

He looks like
the Stay-Puff marshmallow man.

Let me get this straight.

656

Shuko can hot-wire
people's bodies,

657
00:57:28,774 --> 00:57:32,505

of this magic medallion?

We have the element of surprise.

00:57:43,322 --> 00:57:46,758
So prove it.
Make it do something.

01:00:20,146 --> 01:00:26,449
OK, the plan is that l have
loaded Abobo's Gangnet link...

695

with false information...

696
01:00:27,987 --> 01:00:30,319
so it seems like
the Maniacs are getting...

697
01:00:30,356 --> 01:00:31,618
an unfair profit share.

698
01:00:31,657 --> 01:00:34,922
Once l download this
into Shuko's mainframe,

699
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,258
it should start a gang mutiny.

700

That is the plan.

an emergency, this is it.

The brothers were abandoned
and raised by wolves.

Together, they built
the great city of Rome.

Romulus killed Remus.

After all the trouble l've
caused you, it dawned on me--

01:26:01,752 --> 01:26:05,313
the New Angeles police
department is underfunded.

-No, Jimmy.

you could use some help.
