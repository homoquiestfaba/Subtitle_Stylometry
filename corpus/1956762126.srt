Tonight on "Newsreaders," we take you inside
the world-famous snead normandy youth golf

3
00:00:04,274 --> 00:00:07,475
academy -- breeding ground
for world-class professional

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,930
golfers, or training camp
for Al-qaeda sleeper cells?

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,320
Also, we catch up with famed
newsman Dan rather and learn

6
00:00:14,355 --> 00:00:18,323
about his second career as part
of the dirty south hip-hop scene.

7
00:00:18,358 --> 00:00:21,595
It turns out Bone Crusher,
Bun B, and I share an agent.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,734
The rest, as I say in my song
"Fact Man To Da 404," is history.

9
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:31,139
All that and more
tonight on "Newsreaders."

10
00:00:40,615 --> 00:00:43,618
60 years ago, when Dr. Alfred
Kinsey published his

11
00:00:43,653 --> 00:00:47,489
seminal work on human sexuality,
he never could have imagined the

12
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:51,460
things we would be doing
<i>with and to</i> our genitalia.

13
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:54,596
And Dr. Kinsey surely could
never have imagined that

14
00:00:54,632 --> 00:00:58,266
America's changing sexual habits
might one day revitalize a

15
00:00:58,302 --> 00:01:01,003
struggling American auto industry.

16
00:01:01,038 --> 00:01:03,005
Not only might they, did they.

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,709
The story of the rebirth of
Detroit steel begins in, of all

18
00:01:06,745 --> 00:01:10,480
places, this eastern Arizona
state university dorm room,

19
00:01:10,516 --> 00:01:13,451
where sports drink marketing
majors Ethan Lexworth and

20
00:01:13,486 --> 00:01:16,120
Micah Berkeley had a simple idea.

21
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:19,657
Well, we didn't have a
ride for Bonnaroo and...

22
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:23,228
I said, "Dude, if -- I bet if we
had a cool but nondescript van,

23
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:26,131
I bet we could drive ourselves
there and get girls that we

24
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,633
don't know to have sex with us."

25
00:01:27,668 --> 00:01:29,701
I was like, "Yeah, totally."

26
00:01:29,737 --> 00:01:32,203
And then like 10 minutes
later, I had another idea.

27
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,771
You had a second idea.

28
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:35,106
Yeah. It just hit me.

29
00:01:35,142 --> 00:01:36,641
It was like a freight truck.

30
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:39,711
And did you say
what the second idea was?

31
00:01:39,747 --> 00:01:43,282
I was like, "Uh, cool, and
then if we film us having sex

32
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:46,585
with the girls, we could just
put it up on the Internet."

33
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:48,254
LaFonda:

34
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:48,821
It's genius.

35
00:01:49,757 --> 00:01:50,489
You guys.

36
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:51,357
Whatever.

37
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:52,825
LaFonda:

38
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:53,793
How was Bonnaroo?

39
00:01:53,828 --> 00:01:55,094
We didn't make it.

40
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:56,462
Yeah, we kind of got busy.

41
00:01:56,497 --> 00:01:57,597
LaFonda:

42
00:01:57,633 --> 00:02:00,033
More like boner-roo. Am I right?

43
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:01,334
Nobody really says "boner"

44
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,402
anymore.

45
00:02:02,437 --> 00:02:04,698
They leased the
15-passenger van and just

46
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:09,265
outside the dealership lot, an
Internet sensation was born.

47
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,100
Why don't you get inside the van?

48
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:12,234
We'll get a little weird.

49
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,402
Okay. That sounds fun.

50
00:02:13,438 --> 00:02:14,703
Oh, girl!

51
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:16,772
Oh, that is hella bangin'.

52
00:02:16,807 --> 00:02:22,410
Ethan and Micah's videos
spread like a viral Internet video.

53
00:02:22,445 --> 00:02:26,113
And like apple computer and
Jesus, another successful

54
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:29,316
business was once again born in a garage.

55
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:33,283
And now America needed
more garages...for vans.

56
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,352
As the [Bleep] Van videos gained
in popularity, vans sales spiked

57
00:02:37,387 --> 00:02:41,155
across the country, and auto
manufacturers began to heavily

58
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,323
market them as luxury items.

59
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:48,795
The new American auto motor's
benchmark l -- roomy, sleek,

60
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,565
stylish, sophisticated, and sexy.

61
00:02:52,600 --> 00:03:00,405
Much more than transportation, it gets
you exactly what you're looking for.

62
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,541
In just two years,
Ethan and Micah made enough

63
00:03:03,577 --> 00:03:07,078
money to buy an entire floor
of their dormitory, which now

64
00:03:07,113 --> 00:03:08,613
houses the  van offices.

65
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:12,349
America's love affair with vans
seemed to know no bounds, but it

66
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:14,651
learned some bounds thanks to one man.

67
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:19,255
His name is Ames Mackenzie,
and he's suing American Auto.

68
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:22,325
I bought one of their vans
and drove it around for two

69
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,296
weeks, approached girls at
parking lots and parking

70
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:33,335
garages and strip malls, regular
malls, sports arenas, turnpike

71
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:37,005
rest areas, uh...Carl's Jr.

72
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,042
Parking lots, Arby's parking
lots, Rax Roast Beef's parking

73
00:03:42,077 --> 00:03:49,115
lots, um...parks, dog parks,
Del Taco parking lots.

74
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:50,283
Did I say sports arenas?

75
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:51,551
Yes, you did.

76
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:56,756
Sports arenas and the marina, and
none of the girls would even

77
00:03:56,792 --> 00:04:00,494
get into the van, let alone take
off their top and do stuff.

78
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:03,197
So, here you
are, stuck with a lemon.

79
00:04:03,232 --> 00:04:05,199
A lemon with the premium package.

80
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:06,467
Heated seats?

81
00:04:06,502 --> 00:04:08,236
Heated seat belts.

82
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:11,205
I understand why
you're suing American auto, but

83
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:12,473
why would you sue [Bleep] Van?

84
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:15,443
Well, first of all, I work as a
file clerk at a law firm, so

85
00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:16,577
the paperwork's nothing.

86
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:18,612
Everything on our website is 100% real.

87
00:04:18,647 --> 00:04:21,147
So, you guys aren't
worried about this lawsuit?

88
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:23,116
Sorry if he couldn't
get laid with the van.

89
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:23,650
It works for us.

90
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:26,052
You guys -- you guys
are just getting laid all the

91
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:27,087
time in college, aren't you?

92
00:04:27,122 --> 00:04:31,091
You're just, like... I
think I was born 20 -- 10

93
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:32,692
years too early, you know?

94
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:34,728
I, uh... but you can just get a van.

95
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:35,662
They're stylish.

96
00:04:35,697 --> 00:04:36,663
You should get one.

97
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:39,366
And that's just what
we did, to find out if their

98
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:41,435
website was legitimate.

99
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:45,206
So, Cammie, you've been in
several [Bleep] Van videos.

100
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,775
Are you familiar with the -- 
No, no, no, no.

101
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,109
That's --
No, no.

102
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:51,745
Just -- 
You can put your shirt back down.

103
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:53,080
It's okay.

104
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:56,184
Um...where was I?

105
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:57,051
Uh...right.

106
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:59,621
Have you heard about
the lawsuit going on?

107
00:04:59,656 --> 00:05:00,488
Oh, yeah.

108
00:05:00,524 --> 00:05:02,090
I saw that guy suing on TV.

109
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,359
He probably had a dirty van.

110
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:07,161
That's why girls wouldn't
get in it and do stuff.

111
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:09,964
So, you think
the van was the problem?

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,299
Maybe.

113
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:16,338
I mean [Bleep] Vans are always spotless
on the outside and roomy on the inside.

114
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:17,405
And they're so sleek.

115
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:20,575
Plus they're comfortable
and kind of sophisticated.

116
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,577
Do you think -- 
No, no, no, Cammie.

117
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,079
No, no. Stop, stop, stop.

118
00:05:24,114 --> 00:05:26,148
Just...pull it down.

119
00:05:26,183 --> 00:05:28,183
It's  not necessary.

120
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:29,585
It's really hot in here.

121
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,253
Everything's heated.

122
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:33,122
I don't know.

123
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:37,160
Maybe the van wasn't clean
enough to be enticing.

124
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:40,530
No, it was detailed before I got it.

125
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:43,132
Do you smell something?

126
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:44,767
I ate salami yesterday.

127
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:48,538
I-I-I-I think that's
possible it might be it.

128
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:51,274
[Bleep] Van appeared to be
guilty of nothing more than

129
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,677
providing a file clerk with an
outlet for his paperwork skills,

130
00:05:54,713 --> 00:05:58,648
until "Newsreaders" received a
call from somebody -- an insider

131
00:05:58,683 --> 00:06:01,217
who said they had inside information.

132
00:06:01,253 --> 00:06:02,719
I had to say something.

133
00:06:02,754 --> 00:06:04,155
Is that you, Cammie?

134
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:06,564
No. No.

135
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,367
The source, who
we'll call Woodward, because

136
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:12,970
calling her deep throat would be
too on the nose, decided to come

137
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,373
forward because she had seen too much.

138
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,575
Please, just put your top down.

139
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,310
Look, I know that's you, Cammie.

140
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,479
[Bleep] Van is not what you think it is.

141
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,449
I was in 20 videos, and all of
a sudden, they fired me, and I

142
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:25,651
lost my health insurance.

143
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,619
They give you healthcare?

144
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:28,453
And dental.

145
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,521
Full premium package.

146
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:30,356
Fully heated.

147
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:32,527
That doesn't make any sense.

148
00:06:32,563 --> 00:06:34,430
It will when you read this.

149
00:06:34,465 --> 00:06:39,636
That folder contained a
Pandora's box of shocking revelations.

150
00:06:39,672 --> 00:06:43,273
These documents told the untold
story that some very powerful

151
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:46,009
corporate interests did
not want to be told.

152
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:49,446
According to one American auto
internal memo [Bleep] Van was

153
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:53,184
not the work of two enterprising
college students, but like the

154
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:57,522
Bonnaroo music festival, sprang from
a polished corporate boardroom.

155
00:06:57,557 --> 00:07:00,726
Yes, we are completely
behind [Bleep] Van.

156
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:03,728
So, you don't deny this?

157
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:04,996
No. No.

158
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:06,665
We're very proud of it.

159
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,033
It was brilliant advertising.

160
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:09,234
We gave those two kids a van.

161
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:11,670
And you sent them out
on the street to make videos

162
00:07:11,705 --> 00:07:14,239
of themself having sex with
girls they just picked up, huh?

163
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:17,042
No, actually, we told them to
have sex with their girlfriends,

164
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:19,544
then make it look like they
picked them up on the street,

165
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,148
and then we created a website
for them, and the videos just

166
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:24,282
went off the charts.

167
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:28,320
Even more successful than any of the
alternative music festivals we've created.

168
00:07:28,355 --> 00:07:29,621
Even Coachella?

169
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,289
Yeah.

170
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,625
Then we launched the Benchmark L
commercials and --

171
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,029
To coincide with the
success of the [Bleep] Van website.

172
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:38,164
Yeah, the van sales
went through the roof.

173
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,701
So, you're not only an auto
manufacturer, you're a porn producer.

174
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:43,136
I wouldn't call it porn.

175
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,238
What would you call it?

176
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:48,776
Um... sexy van...stories.

177
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:50,377
Pornography. N-no?

178
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:50,778
Stories.

179
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:51,645
Stories.

180
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,779
Human interest.

181
00:07:52,815 --> 00:07:54,381
We had student loans.

182
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,283
American auto gave us
the vans, the scripts.

183
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:00,153
What? They gave
you "Hella bangin'"?

184
00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:02,288
Man, listen to yourself.

185
00:08:02,324 --> 00:08:03,256
No one says that.

186
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:05,325
American auto totally came
up with "Hella bangin'."

187
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,560
And you, Cammie, I
mean, why are you blowing the

188
00:08:07,596 --> 00:08:09,396
whistle when you were
in on this whole thing?

189
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:12,432
Ethan and I broke up and the car
company wouldn't let us have

190
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:14,368
sex on camera unless we were together.

191
00:08:14,404 --> 00:08:17,172
American automotive is a
real conservative company.

192
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:20,275
Bro, I mean, I
personally watched videos of you

193
00:08:20,311 --> 00:08:22,378
having sex with over two dozen women.

194
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:23,546
Mm. Yeah.

195
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:25,648
I'm a total serial dater.

196
00:08:25,683 --> 00:08:27,650
Totally defines himself
by who he's dating.

197
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:30,218
That is the wussiest
thing I've ever heard of.

198
00:08:30,254 --> 00:08:31,286
I have a poet's heart.

199
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:34,422
Dude, like, what--
what happened to us?

200
00:08:34,457 --> 00:08:35,990
What are you talking about?

201
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:39,560
You know, downing brews
and, like, hangin', bangin'.

202
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:40,595
Banging what?

203
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,032
Like, you know,
bangin' -- hella bangin' --

204
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:46,034
we told you no one says that, man.

205
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:49,170
You deceived the
American public, and you

206
00:08:49,206 --> 00:08:52,741
encouraged young girls to think
that it's okay to have sex with

207
00:08:52,776 --> 00:08:54,376
strangers in moving vans.

208
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:55,777
We are an auto manufacturer.

209
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:56,778
Mm-hmm.

210
00:08:56,814 --> 00:08:59,081
We have done way worse things than this.

211
00:08:59,116 --> 00:09:00,048
Such as?

212
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:05,287
The annual California wildfires, periodic
e. coli breakouts in fresh produce,

213
00:09:05,323 --> 00:09:11,393
burning man, the <i>Exxon Valdez,
cat vomit, hepatitis "B," but

214
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:14,029
<i>not "C," uh... the zodiac killer.

215
00:09:14,064 --> 00:09:15,564
<i>That was you guys?

216
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:17,700
<i>No, but only because
we didn't think of it.

217
00:09:17,735 --> 00:09:20,569
<i>I mean, you're
kind of an evil person.

218
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:23,105
<i>Do you have any other questions for me?

219
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,341
<i>Finally tonight, a few
thoughts from Skip Reming.

220
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:29,244
<i>My grandchildren, Rider and
Madison -- yes, those are the

221
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,146
<i>names their parents actually
chose to give them -- always ask

222
00:09:32,182 --> 00:09:34,982
<i>me why things used to be so
much better in the olden days.

223
00:09:35,018 --> 00:09:36,383
<i>My answer's always the same.

224
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:39,420
<i>First of all, when kids used
to ask questions, they did it

225
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:42,623
<i>looking you in the eye, wearing
a shirt with a collar and shoes

226
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:43,691
<i>with leather soles.

227
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:46,493
<i>And then I tell them things were
better because cigarettes tasted

228
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:48,162
<i>like burning flesh.

229
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:49,196
<i>A man was a man.

230
00:09:49,232 --> 00:09:52,400
<i>It was illegal for doctors to
turn a penis into a vagina.

231
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:55,503
<i>You could lease a new horse
every year, Turkey sandwiches

232
00:09:55,538 --> 00:09:59,473
<i>were a quarter, and prostitutes
were two Turkey sandwiches.

233
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:02,210
<i>But these kids aren't listening,
not even looking at me.

234
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:05,046
<i>They're off in a corner, playing
a ninja video game in their

235
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:10,317
<i>[bleep] rubber-soled shoes
that light up when they walk.

236
00:10:10,353 --> 00:10:13,120
<i>Coming up next week,
with summer vacations just

237
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:15,656
<i>around the corner, we have a
story that may make you think

238
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:19,227
<i>twice when planning that
Vietnamese sex-tourism adventure.

239
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:22,697
<i>Their brochures promised
exquisite sex workers.

240
00:10:22,732 --> 00:10:26,601
<i>And I flew all the way over
there, went to like 12 different

241
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:30,270
<i>brothels, and none of the
girls would have sex with me.

242
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:33,634
<i>If you would like a
transcript of tonight's program,

243
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,104
<i>use both your DVR and a
computer, and you can probably

244
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:37,905
<i>knock it out in a couple of hours.

245
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:39,595
<i>I'm Louis LaFonda.

246
00:10:39,842 --> 00:10:40,879
<i>Good night.

247
