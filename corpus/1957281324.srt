00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:34,351
THE WOMAN AND CULT MEMBERS: We have
been hiding among you for generations.

3
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:35,987
We are everywhere.

4
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,823
We bag your groceries,
we teach your children,

5
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:41,725
we fight your wars,

6
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,029
always beneath your notice,
always searching.

7
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:49,867
Tonight, we finally claim
what's rightfully ours,

8
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:54,671
power, unholy and unspeakable.

9
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:56,640
Power that had been hidden
from us

10
00:00:56,673 --> 00:00:59,409
beneath a house of lies,

11
00:00:59,442 --> 00:01:04,347
power to remake this weak world
in our image,

12
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:09,452
power to cheat death
and live forever in darkness.

13
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,956
We are the divide.

14
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,391
We carry on.

15
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:18,896
JOSIE: Feels like I'm
back in high school

16
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,865
with you driving me around.

17
00:01:20,898 --> 00:01:22,800
JOSIE'S MOM: Josie,
I still drive you around everywhere.

18
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:26,369
JOSIE: No,
sometimes the Castillos pick me up.

19
00:01:26,403 --> 00:01:28,005
JOSIE'S MOM: Just don't call
me five minutes after I leave

20
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,373
asking me to come back
and get you.

21
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:31,541
JOSIE:
That only happened twice.

22
00:01:31,575 --> 00:01:33,510
JOSIE'S MOM: Because you
only went to a party twice.

23
00:01:34,812 --> 00:01:36,379
Are you sure
I'm still goin' the right way?

24
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:38,448
JOSIE:
Yeah, this is right.

25
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:40,517
The house is
really high up here.

26
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,819
I love it.

27
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:42,820
JOSIE'S MOM:
Don't you ever get scared?

28
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:43,955
I know I'd be.

29
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:45,122
JOSIE:
Nah.

30
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:45,990
It's so hard to find this place,

31
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,125
I don't think it's even
on any map.

32
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,460
JOSIE'S MOM:
It's not on my GPS.

33
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:52,529
Is their daughter
in your Mustard Seed's troop?

34
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:54,397
JOSIE:
Not yet, next year.

35
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,735
JOSIE'S MOM: Oh, you're still going
to be a troop leader next year?

36
00:01:58,769 --> 00:01:59,469
(Josie chuckles)

37
00:01:59,502 --> 00:02:00,805
JOSIE:
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

38
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:02,639
JOSIE'S MOM: Honey, you're
surrounded by a bunch of 10-year-olds

39
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:03,473
when you're there.

40
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:04,441
(Josie chuckles)

41
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:05,575
JOSIE:
Thanks, mom.

42
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:06,844
JOSIE'S MOM: I don't mean to be
harsh, but I just...

43
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,212
JOSIE:
What?

44
00:02:08,246 --> 00:02:09,847
JOSIE'S MOM: Weren't you invited
to some Christmas party tonight?

45
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:10,747
JOSIE:
Oh.

46
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:13,751
- Yeah, I was, but...
- (Josie sighs)

47
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:16,720
JOSIE: The Castillos
asked me to babysit, so.

48
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:17,855
JOSIE'S MOM: I thought all
your friends would be there.

49
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,090
Are you sure
I didn't miss the turn?

50
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:20,523
JOSIE:
No, it's up a little further.

51
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,492
And only Kate, but...

52
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:25,863
It's fine though, I... I'd
honestly rather be babysitting.

53
00:02:25,897 --> 00:02:27,765
JOSIE'S MOM:
That's what I'm worried about.

54
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:29,432
JOSIE:
What do you mean?

55
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:32,003
JOSIE'S MOM:
Josie, I feel like you aren't...

56
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:33,971
I don't know,
making the most of your life.

57
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:35,306
JOSIE: You think
partying would fix that?

58
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:37,909
JOSIE'S MOM: No, but I just
wish you'd let yourself have fun

59
00:02:37,942 --> 00:02:39,542
every once in a while.

60
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,178
And with people your own age.

61
00:02:41,212 --> 00:02:42,847
JOSIE: I have fun when
I'm at Mustard Seeds.

62
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,582
It's... I just...
the house is up ahead.

63
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:48,618
Look, mom, I appreciate you
worrying about me,

64
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:50,788
but I'm fine.

65
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:51,956
I promise.

66
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:54,658
JOSIE'S MOM:
Okay, if you say so.

67
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:55,659
Well, keep me updated

68
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:56,693
on when you think the parents
will be home.

69
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:57,762
I hope it's not too late.

70
00:02:57,795 --> 00:02:58,863
JOSIE:
It shouldn't be.

71
00:02:58,896 --> 00:03:00,563
JOSIE'S MOM:
Love you, be safe.

72
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,033
JOSIE:
Always am.

73
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:04,035
I love you, too.

74
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:05,069
Bye.

Ready or not, here I come!

80
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:39,136
Sophia.

81
00:03:58,923 --> 00:04:00,825
Sophia!

Shit.

Hello?

102
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:21,825
KATE: (On phone)
<i>Josie, you comin' or what?</i>

103
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,027
<i>Everyone's here!</i>

104
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,062
Oh, um, no.

105
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:26,197
Uh, no, not tonight.

106
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,299
KATE: (On phone)
<i>Not tonight?</i>

107
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:31,969
<i>This is the Christmas party,
it only comes once a year.</i>

108
00:07:32,002 --> 00:07:33,337
Uh, a babysitting gig came up.

109
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,638
KATE: (On phone)
<i>Babysitting?</i>

110
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:38,275
<i>Josie, Keith Calhoun has been
asking about you all night!</i>

111
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:40,110
- <i>Get over here!</i>
- I know, I know, but, um...

112
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:41,879
KATE: (On phone)
<i>But what?</i>

113
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:43,347
- (Sighing)
- I... I can't.

114
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,481
KATE: (On phone)
<i>Holy hell, Josie,</i>

115
00:07:44,515 --> 00:07:46,884
<i>if only there was a camp badge
for getting laid.</i>

116
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:47,985
<i>You gotta grow up sometime.</i>

117

120
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:19,316
I don't know
where Sophia could be.

121
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,053
I mean I've searched
like every inch of this house

122
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:25,289
except for the one spot
where Sophia knows

123
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:27,057
that she's never allowed
to hide,

124
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:29,260
'cause it's so dangerous.

125
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:36,900
And I know that Sophia
would never break any rules,

126
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,470
she's a little angel.

127
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:41,238
- Oh!
- Aah!

128
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:43,107
You can't hide in there,
little monster,

129
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,509
- you could have suffocated!
- I know.

130
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:46,910
I tricked you, Josie.

131
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,146
- (Grunts)
- Alright, come on.

132
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:51,081
(Grunting)

133
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:53,117
Come on,
let's get out of here.

134
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:59,356
Plus, it's not fair,
you were totally cheating.

135
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,859
And whoa-ho!

136
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:03,060
What are these?

137
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:05,496
My ninja swords for protection.

138
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,298
Well, you have me for that.

139
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:09,833
And besides,
if you hurt yourself with these,

140
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:11,235
then all our fun would be over.

141
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:14,305
Think I can hit the bull's-eye
from here?

142
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:16,140
No way.

143
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:17,308
Watch this.

144
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:27,284

145
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,492

- Oh.

146
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:38,629
Okay, just don't... don't
tell your parents about that.

147
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:41,498
SOPHIA:
Okay.

148
00:09:46,603 --> 00:09:48,505
I'm the hide-and-seek king.

149
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:52,042
Huh, no one's better
at hide-and-seek than me.

150
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:54,611
Where is this pizza guy?

151
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:58,148
SOPHIA: Can we play
again after pizza, mom?

152
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,116
Mom?

153
00:10:00,284 --> 00:10:02,152
I'm your friend Josie, silly.

154
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:07,391
One more time after pizza,
promise?

155
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:09,593
Alright.

156
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:12,930
Cross my heart and hope to die,
Mustard Seed's honor.

157
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:16,433
Pizza's here.

158
00:10:24,141 --> 00:10:25,008
(Gasps)

159
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:25,909
Oh, shoot,
I did not mean to scare you.

160
00:10:25,943 --> 00:10:28,979
Wow, you guys are home
like super early.

161
00:10:29,012 --> 00:10:30,981
- The party was...
- Not cool enough, apparently.

162
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:31,682
(Chuckling)

163
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,217
Hey, Mrs. Castillo.

164
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:37,287
You're not pizza.

165
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:39,356
Well,
you're not exactly pizza either.

166
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,058
Am I right, Jen?

167
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:42,092
Come here.

168
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,263
Mmm, muah.

169
00:10:46,296 --> 00:10:48,165
- How was she?
- She was great.

170
00:10:48,198 --> 00:10:50,300
We played hide-and-go-seek, we...

171
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:53,103
I almost suffocated.

172
00:10:53,137 --> 00:10:54,571
Wha...

173
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:56,940
Oh, who's ready to rock out
with their cunt...

174
00:10:56,974 --> 00:10:57,908
Patch!

175
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:01,345
Oh, shit, sorry.

176
00:11:02,546 --> 00:11:04,081

00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:28,099
You have a job to do.

359
00:22:28,132 --> 00:22:38,075
(♪♪♪)

360
00:22:57,761 --> 00:22:58,963
Tell me, Rick,

361
00:23:00,865 --> 00:23:02,933
how long have you lived
in this house?

362
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:05,169
About 10 years.

363
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:11,308
10 years, huh?

364
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:19,283
In those 10 years...

365
00:23:25,189 --> 00:23:27,391
...you seen anything
that looks like this?

366
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:33,063
A box?

367
00:23:38,402 --> 00:23:41,906
We have some jewelry boxes
and a safe.

368
00:23:41,939 --> 00:23:46,477
This is why we mark our bodies,
reshape ourselves.

369
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,145
(Intruder takes a deep breath)

370
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:50,247
People like you are content

371
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:53,117
to live in the image
of their silent God!

372
00:23:53,150 --> 00:24:02,459
(♪♪♪)

373
00:24:02,493 --> 00:24:05,462
And just like Him,

374
00:24:07,464 --> 00:24:09,300
you don't listen.

375
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:19,243
(♪♪♪)

376
00:24:23,247 --> 00:24:26,884
I didn't ask if you brought
something into this house.

377
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:29,153
I asked if you discovered it.

378
00:24:31,188 --> 00:24:32,456
I'm... I'm sorry.

379
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:35,526
No, we never discovered
anything here.

380
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:38,929
(Taking deep breaths)

381
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:48,906

382
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,199

(♪♪♪)

384
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:45,195
THE INTRUDER: You know who once
lived and died in these walls?

385
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:50,401
RICK: No, it...
it was uh, empty for years before us.

386
00:25:50,434 --> 00:25:51,502
Decades probably.

387
00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:53,404
Ever wonder why that is, Rick?

388
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:56,173
(Grunting)

389
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:58,175
What the...

390
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:00,878
(Taking deep breaths)

391
00:26:00,911 --> 00:26:02,479
What was that?

392
00:26:02,513 --> 00:26:04,214
- What?
- That noise!

393
00:26:04,248 --> 00:26:06,617
You're losing control
of the situation.

394
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,118
You would spill the blood
of the father...

395
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:10,587
There is somebody else
in this house.

396
00:26:14,191 --> 00:26:17,061
(Taking deep breaths)

397
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,397
No, that's us.

398
00:26:25,302 --> 00:26:26,937
We have begun.

399
00:26:28,605 --> 00:26:30,341
There's no one else here

400
00:26:30,374 --> 00:26:33,010
and you are wasting
precious time.

401
00:26:36,313 --> 00:26:37,548
Why are you...

402
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:41,518
No more words.

403
00:26:43,287 --> 00:26:44,922
Take them down, all of them.

404
00:26:46,924 --> 00:26:48,258
You ain't over me.

405
00:26:53,364 --> 00:26:56,033
(Taking deep breaths)

406

(♪♪♪)

407
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:30,567
Sophia, do you wanna know
a secret?

408
00:27:33,704 --> 00:27:35,339
Open your eyes, Sophia.

409
00:27:38,475 --> 00:27:41,578
Open your eyes now!

410
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,383
I'm the devil.

411
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:53,357
(Taking deep breaths)

412
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:17,714

417
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:50,147
That's it?

418
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:57,354
Think about this house
and what it means.

419
00:28:57,387 --> 00:28:59,556
Did this room call to you
or did you just start

420
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,592
with the first room
that you saw?

421
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:04,495
The box will call to you.

422
00:29:04,528 --> 00:29:06,396
Are you listening?

423
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,233
Think blueprints,
think locations

424
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:12,536
that were marked in these walls.

425
00:29:12,569 --> 00:29:15,105
Those locations are finite.

426
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:18,308
As finite as the true universe.

427
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:23,413
In a finite universe,
all mystery is extinct.

428
00:29:23,447 --> 00:29:24,581
Listen.

429
00:29:24,615 --> 00:29:27,084
Does the box call to you now?

(♪♪♪)

434
00:31:33,911 --> 00:31:35,612
Why are you stopping?

435
00:31:38,783 --> 00:31:42,185
Yeah, she bit your hand,
and you almost killed her,

436
00:31:43,855 --> 00:31:45,923
and now,
you wanna finish the job.

437
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:53,697
What is your name?

438
00:31:55,632 --> 00:31:56,667
Boy.

439
00:31:57,969 --> 00:32:01,238
Hmm, an old-school breed.

440
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:03,273
You listen to me, Boy.

441
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:07,377
It is never productive
to live outside the task.

442
00:32:07,411 --> 00:32:08,980
That family downstairs,

443
00:32:09,013 --> 00:32:11,615
they will all be destroyed
tonight.

444
00:32:11,648 --> 00:32:15,419
We will feed them to this house.

445
00:32:15,452 --> 00:32:17,922
That's why we need to find
the box.

446
00:32:19,556 --> 00:32:21,759
What does it say in here?

447
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:29,967
We are what comes next.

448
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:31,869
This world is ours to destroy.

449
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:36,707
With the tools of man
and the blood of our enemy.

450
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,608
We are what comes next.

451
00:32:38,642 --> 00:32:41,745
This world is ours to remake
for our own.

452
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:44,281
No law but our will.

453
00:32:44,314 --> 00:32:46,450
No God but our desire.

454
00:32:46,483 --> 00:32:47,919
We are what comes next.

455
00:32:49,286 --> 00:32:50,888
We are the divide.

456
00:32:50,922 --> 00:32:52,556
(Taking deep breaths)

457
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:55,860
But the f...

458
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:58,462
The only way
that family dies

459
00:32:58,495 --> 00:33:02,399
is with their blood spilling
from the black masks.

460
00:33:02,432 --> 00:33:05,569
That is the ritual,
that's how it works.

461
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,741
THE WOMAN:
This is our time.

462
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:19,282
So go find the box now
or this is all for nothing.

463
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:27,825

467
00:34:02,994 --> 00:34:04,361
THE INTRUDER: (On walkie-talkie)
<i>What's this?</i>

468
00:34:05,997 --> 00:34:07,631
They were yelling
about a pizza guy before,

469
00:34:07,664 --> 00:34:08,966
that's all this is.

470
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,472

No, stay hidden.

473
00:34:40,765 --> 00:34:42,399
I'll get rid of him.

474
00:35:09,026 --> 00:35:13,630
PIZZA GUY: Of course,
it's black, definitely and...

475
00:35:13,663 --> 00:35:15,565
- Well, the house?
- No, it's older.

476
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:24,108
Oh, hey, call you back.

477
00:35:24,141 --> 00:35:25,042
Ugh, so sorry.

478
00:35:25,076 --> 00:35:27,477
I... I got lost tryin'
to find this place

479
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,046
all the way up here.

480
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,147
Tried to call
like a thousand times,

481
00:35:30,181 --> 00:35:31,715
but I... I guess your phones
are out or somethin'.

482
00:35:32,783 --> 00:35:35,619
Obviously, this is free.

483
00:35:35,652 --> 00:35:37,587
Also, I got some coupons here
for you somewhere.

484
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:38,421
We don't need any.

485
00:35:38,455 --> 00:35:39,589
No, no, no,
these are really good.

486
00:35:39,623 --> 00:35:40,490
Hang on.

487
00:35:40,523 --> 00:35:42,159
Hope I didn't leave 'em
in my ride.

488
00:35:42,193 --> 00:35:45,029
These are like BOGO you know,
buy one, get one free.

489
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:47,098
(Grinder whirring)

490
00:35:51,668 --> 00:35:54,872
Uh, everything okay in there?

491
00:35:57,507 --> 00:35:58,109
Remodeling.

492
00:35:58,142 --> 00:35:59,743
Ah!

493
00:35:59,777 --> 00:36:01,045
A late-night remodeling.

00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:02,013

495
00:36:02,046 --> 00:36:03,580

Okay, again, so sorry.

499
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:17,929
Look, if uh, Mr. Lawrence Eddie
didn't find out about this,

500
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:20,231
I'd really...
Whoa, dude!

501
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:22,499
- What is that?

502
00:36:22,532 --> 00:36:23,868
Is that Rick Castillo?

503
00:36:23,901 --> 00:36:24,969
Does he live here?

504
00:36:26,703 --> 00:36:29,240
Oh man, shut up right now, uh...

505
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:29,941
This is like a life goal.

I'm literally like a student
of his entire career.

508
00:36:35,512 --> 00:36:38,515
Mr. Castillo is not at home,
it is late.

509
00:36:38,548 --> 00:36:42,619
I'm sure you can understand
how he would like his privacy.

510
00:36:42,652 --> 00:36:44,255
Oh, uh, yeah.
So sorry.

511
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:46,456
Uh, have a terrific night
and everything!

512
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:55,699
Dude, can you guess
where I'm standing right now?

513
00:36:55,732 --> 00:36:56,700
Why would you assume

514
00:36:56,733 --> 00:36:58,970
that means I'm standing
on top of something?

515
00:36:59,003 --> 00:37:00,004
(Indistinct speech)

516
00:37:00,037 --> 00:37:01,839
He's talking too much.

PIZZA GUY:
Just... just stop.

518
00:37:08,112 --> 00:37:09,280
Okay, you're never gonna get it,
okay?

519
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:11,048
I'll just tell you.

520
00:37:11,082 --> 00:37:15,618
I am currently
at Rick Castillo's front yard,

521
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:16,686
for real.

522
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,590
The biggest music producer
in the world lives here.

523
00:37:20,623 --> 00:37:23,894
No, I didn't actually meet him.

524
00:37:26,629 --> 00:37:27,664
...one-eyed lady.

525
00:37:28,933 --> 00:37:30,001

Answer the question!

I got some more pies to deliver.

Yeah, it's the damn babysitter.

that was the babysitter.

THE INTRUDER: You're gonna
have a really long night.

727
00:52:10,781 --> 00:52:12,515
I'm gonna make a woman

(Grunting)

733
00:52:26,831 --> 00:52:29,133
Oh, think you could do me
some damage?

734
00:52:31,668 --> 00:52:32,970
I'll... I'll stop you.

735
00:52:33,004 --> 00:52:34,471
No!

736
00:52:36,007 --> 00:52:38,475
What happens after you hit me
with that, huh?

737
00:52:38,508 --> 00:52:40,044
What do you think?

738
00:52:40,077 --> 00:52:41,012
One tap.

739
00:52:42,479 --> 00:52:45,415
That's it, lights out,
end of my story?

740
00:52:47,818 --> 00:52:48,819
To get at me with that

741
00:52:48,853 --> 00:52:51,454
you're gonna have
to hit me again,

742
00:52:51,488 --> 00:52:56,227
and again, and again,
and again, and again!

743
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:59,729
Till my head is a bloody pulp!

744
00:52:59,764 --> 00:53:01,799
You think you're made for that?

745
00:53:01,832 --> 00:53:04,101
(Taking deep breaths)

746
00:53:04,135 --> 00:53:06,636
Because if my head's
not a bloody pulp,

747
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:07,905
I'm gonna keep gettin' up

748
00:53:07,939 --> 00:53:09,807
and I'd keep comin' for you
with this!

749
00:53:11,175 --> 00:53:13,543
That's the difference
between us.

750
00:53:13,576 --> 00:53:14,812
I will.

751
00:53:14,845 --> 00:53:16,180
I will stop you.

(Chuckling)

756
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:27,992
You're a spoiled child.

757
00:53:30,527 --> 00:53:34,198
When I was a child
I was raised to hurt people.

758
00:53:34,231 --> 00:53:36,167
I liked hurting people.

759
00:53:38,202 --> 00:53:40,737
I still like hurting people.

760
00:53:41,973 --> 00:53:43,808
You understand?

761
00:53:45,943 --> 00:53:51,215
I bet you've never hurt anybody
in your whole life.

762
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:55,186
I'm willing to bet my blood
on it.

You can't do nothin',

766
00:54:07,765 --> 00:54:10,835
This was always gonna
happen here, babysitter.

My whole life
I've never hurt anybody.

773
00:54:31,155 --> 00:54:32,790
Not even to defend myself.

774
00:54:33,824 --> 00:54:34,657
