1
00:02:59,342 --> 00:03:00,742
<i>Thank you.</i>

2
00:03:09,854 --> 00:03:11,422
I got you.

3
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,890
<i>So this woman,</i>
<i>you know, she's flirting,</i>

4
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,625
asking all these questions.

5
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,228
You know, she came
to buy a tree,

6
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,296
but suddenly she's less
and less interested.

7
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,634
So, she convinces him
to sneak away for a minute.

8
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:24,370
<i>So they go behind the stand.</i>

9
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:26,606
<i>There's like this little alley</i>
<i>behind the building.</i>

10
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:28,976
Boom, she goes down on him.

11
00:03:28,978 --> 00:03:31,845
He's sitting there,
this freezing ass cold night

12
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:31,845
suddenly ain't so bad, right?

13
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:37,285
Gettin' head from this beautiful
girl, starring up at the stars.

14
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,991
<i>So, he finishes and all of a</i>
<i>sudden she gets all embarrassed</i>

15
00:03:41,993 --> 00:03:43,592
and then she runs away.

16
00:03:43,594 --> 00:03:45,262
And he doesn't
really think about it,

17
00:03:45,264 --> 00:03:47,998
he just walks back to the stand,
gleaming, you know?

18
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,803
He gets back,
all the trees are gone.

19
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:55,606
<i>Shut up.</i>

20
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:58,910
<i>Every single one of 'em, empty.</i>

21
00:03:58,912 --> 00:04:01,280
Wow, even the who-hash.

22
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:15,797
<i>Oh, hi.</i>
<i>How much are those wreaths?</i>

23
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,767
<i>The small ones are $10,</i>
<i>the big ones are $20.</i>

24
00:04:19,035 --> 00:04:21,304
How big are the smalls?

25
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,707
That's a small.

26
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:26,409
Yeah, that's good.

27
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:29,479
- That works?
- Yeah.

28
00:04:30,815 --> 00:04:33,518
- All right, anything else?
- No, thanks.

29
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,132
All right.

30
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:40,326
I'm gonna finish up
the lights out here.

31
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:55,943
<i>It smells so good.</i>

32
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,017
Hey guys, lights are done.

33
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:20,475
Yo, it's not a bad
night's sleep in there.

34
00:06:20,477 --> 00:06:21,877
If you say so.

35
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:24,947
Two sixteen-inch wreaths
and a daddy burger swag.

36
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,671
I like this.

37
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:48,708
Look at this, this is round.
It feels good.

38
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,245
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey.

39
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:54,048
- How much for this one?
- Sixty.

40
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,650
- And that one?
- Also $60.

41
00:06:56,653 --> 00:06:59,654
Yeah, these are all
the same trees, same height.

42
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:02,692
So, what do you think.

43
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:04,126
Oh, it's kinda big.

44
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:06,529
I don't think we have
that much room.

45
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:09,199
What are you talking about?
We got 8-foot ceilings.

46
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:11,802
- We do?
- We bought from you last year.

47
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:13,704
<i>Oh, great.</i>

48
00:07:13,706 --> 00:07:16,975
<i>Is that nice girl</i>
<i>still working here?</i>

49
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:18,877
Not this year.

50
00:07:19,945 --> 00:07:22,948
- You sell the bases?
- Yep, stands.

51
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,551
- Yeah, how much are they?
- $20.

52
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:29,890
Let's go for it.

53
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:31,691
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

54
00:07:33,962 --> 00:07:36,531
<i>Do we have those lights</i>
<i>from last year?</i>

55
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,566
<i>Oh yeah, they're</i>
<i>in a box in the closet,</i>

56
00:07:38,568 --> 00:07:38,566
<i>but I don't think they work.</i>

57
00:07:38,568 --> 00:07:41,303
<i>But they worked last year.</i>

58
00:07:41,305 --> 00:07:42,971
No, I'm telling you
they don't work

59
00:07:42,973 --> 00:07:44,908
because I remember
you were putting them away

60
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:44,908
and you said they were broken.

61
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,278
<i>Why would I save broken lights?</i>

62
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,881
- Do you have lights?
- Yep, white or colored?

63
00:07:50,883 --> 00:07:52,716
<i>We don't need lights.</i>

64
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:55,920
All right, all right.

65
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:02,193
- Here, keep that.
- Oh, great, thanks.

66
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:02,193
<i>Thanks.</i>

67
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:06,599
<i>Just put some hot water</i>
<i>on it tonight.</i>

68
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:09,002
It breaks open the sap
and absorbs better,

69
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:11,138
and then just
lukewarm after that.

70
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,140
- Lukewarm?
- Yeah, middle of the faucet.

71
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:15,009
Okay.

72
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:16,878
All right. Well, thanks.

73
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,713
<i>Here we go.</i>
<i>We'll see you again.</i>

74
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:22,585
<i>Just watch out.</i>
<i>I don't know where you are.</i>

75
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,653
- Thank you.
- All right, thanks.

76
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:46,946
<i>No number ones?</i>

77
00:08:47,247 --> 00:08:48,881
Do you not know the difference?

78
00:08:48,883 --> 00:08:50,383
<i>No, I know the difference.</i>

79
00:08:50,385 --> 00:08:53,120
Oh yeah, well, I just don't
like to sell crappy trees.

80
00:08:53,122 --> 00:08:54,955
All right,
it's your money, man.

81
00:08:54,957 --> 00:08:56,357
My brother
went along with that?

82
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:58,827
<i>Yeah, he didn't care.</i>
<i>He barely sold anything.</i>

83
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,161
<i>He just worked the night shift.</i>

84
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:01,830
<i>That makes sense.</i>

85
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,299
<i>He says hi by the way.</i>

86
00:09:05,235 --> 00:09:08,337
- He still in Massena?
- Yeah, working for our dad.

87
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,311
This is where it usually goes?

88
00:09:14,713 --> 00:09:16,681
<i>Yep, that works.</i>

89
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:20,385
That sign is new.

90
00:09:23,156 --> 00:09:25,391
Finally repaved the road.

91
00:09:25,393 --> 00:09:27,927
I never thought I'd see that.

92
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,097
<i>What else is different?</i>

93
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:08,875
<i>I go back and the tank's</i>
<i>still just sitting there.</i>

94
00:10:10,378 --> 00:10:11,945
<i>I just don't understand</i>

95
00:10:11,947 --> 00:10:14,749
how the people
doesn't care about the jobs.

96
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,919
They gotta know
how shitty they are.

97
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:21,857
Yeah, I guess some people
just don't care.

98
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:26,930
How can you not care,
at least a bit?

99
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:29,199
<i>You know, not everybody's</i>
<i>like you and me, Martin.</i>

100
00:10:29,201 --> 00:10:32,970
<i>Yeah, that's for sure.</i>

101
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:36,407
<i>But you must put up</i>
<i>with a lot of shit around here.</i>

102
00:10:38,478 --> 00:10:40,145
Five years running.

103
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:42,347
Five years?

104
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:44,149
Holy shit.

105
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:47,453
I never done
nothing for 5 years.

106
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:52,092
<i>I was with a woman</i>
<i>for 3 years once.</i>

107
00:10:55,964 --> 00:10:57,365
<i>Where's Mary-Ann?</i>

108
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,768
<i>I didn't see her around.</i>

109
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:02,170
Yep, she's not
around this year.

110
00:11:02,773 --> 00:11:05,508
<i>I am sorry to hear that.</i>

111
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:09,112
That must make
your holiday even tougher.

112
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:12,516
Yeah, it's just 1 month a year.

113
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:15,787
<i>Christmas.</i>

114
00:11:17,322 --> 00:11:19,223
Christmas sucks.

115
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,887
Seven, eight, no frasers?

116
00:11:45,823 --> 00:11:47,957
Lots of smalls.

117
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,425
You got small frasers.

118
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:51,028
<i>Not under 4'.</i>

119
00:11:52,163 --> 00:11:53,897
The new Dougs coming in?

120
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:55,232
<i>Maybe tomorrow.</i>

121
00:11:55,234 --> 00:11:57,502
Truck's stuck in the snow.

122
00:11:57,504 --> 00:12:00,939
<i>The twins sold some tall ones.</i>

123
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:06,178
- How tall?
- A couple 12s, a couple 10s.

124
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,249
You know, those brownstones
over there, high ceilings.

125
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:11,518
- How's your generator doing?
- Good.

126
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:11,518
Why, what happened
to the old one?

127
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,257
<i>Oh, it's noisy.</i>
<i>Some neighbor complained.</i>

128
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:18,593
Hey, keep what's-his-name's
mitts off that thing, will ya?

129
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:20,127
Nick, yeah, he'll be all right.

130
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:21,864
- What's that girlfriend's name?
- Robin.

131
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,399
<i>Robin, she's</i>
<i>a sweet little thing.</i>

132
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:28,872
<i>There's oil under the sink.</i>
<i>Every 2 days.</i>

133
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,298
<i>Hey man, Nick, you gotta do</i>
<i>a better job with these needles.</i>

134
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,234
<i>The last few nights the place</i>
<i>has been covered.</i>

135
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:24,169
But there's barely
any needles anywhere.

136
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,570
Okay, well there
shouldn't be any.

137
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:25,570
If people see the needles

138
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:28,641
they'll think
the trees are dead.

139
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:30,376
<i>The trees are dead,</i>
<i>everyone knows that.</i>

140
00:13:30,378 --> 00:13:32,178
But they don't wanna be
reminded of it, okay?

141
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,449
So when there's needles, which
there will be, you clean 'em up.

142
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:37,117
That's why I do on my shift,

143
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:37,117
that's what you do
on your shift.

144
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:40,055
- Okay, that's how it works.
- Yeah, I know how it works.

145
00:13:40,057 --> 00:13:41,990
All right, all right.

146
00:13:47,197 --> 00:13:48,531
Hey.

147
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:50,667
You know, you don't have to be
so hard on him.

148
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:55,138
- He's done this before.
- Not here.

149
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,076
<i>Yeah, well I'm sure</i>
<i>even you were new once.</i>

150
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:00,545
He's got a problem,
he can say so.

151
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:04,016
<i>We'll be moving</i>
<i>into my sister's place tomorrow.</i>

152
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:06,318
<i>No more trailer.</i>

153
00:16:30,555 --> 00:16:32,923
<i>Really we could trim him</i>
<i>and make him skinny, right?</i>

154
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,525
<i>Yeah.</i>

155
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:12,435
<i>I think we got everything,</i>

156
00:17:12,437 --> 00:17:14,772
but if not
we'll just grab it tomorrow.

157
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:17,341
- All right.
- See you in the morning.

158
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:19,310
<i>See you guys.</i>

159
00:18:25,288 --> 00:18:28,357
Sir, is that yours?

160
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,332
Hello? Ma'am?

161
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:38,603
Hello?

162
00:18:39,571 --> 00:18:41,506
<i>Do you know her?</i>

163
00:18:45,412 --> 00:18:46,912
<i>Ma'am?</i>

164
00:18:47,747 --> 00:18:49,515
<i>Ma'am?</i>

165
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:52,652
<i>Is this your phone, sir?</i>

166
00:18:53,087 --> 00:18:54,921
Ma'am?

167
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:01,796
<i>Is this your phone?</i>

168
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:04,032
<i>Wake up. Wake up.</i>

169
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:07,769
Fuck.

170
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,380
All right, a couple more steps.

171
00:19:22,888 --> 00:19:24,989
Step up. Big step up.

172
00:21:22,862 --> 00:21:25,196
Yep. Five years.

173
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:28,000
<i>You still with Mary-Ann?</i>
<i>She not here this year?</i>

174
00:21:28,002 --> 00:21:30,870
No, she's... yeah,
just me this year.

175
00:22:06,913 --> 00:22:09,549
<i>I don't know, the real kind?</i>

176
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:11,617
<i>They all look the same to me.</i>

177
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,921
Under the shelf, no way.

178
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:16,056
It's not gonna fit.

179
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:18,859
It's not a height issue,
it's the width.

180
00:22:18,861 --> 00:22:21,062
I know because
I'm staring at it.

181
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:23,231
I don't know,
they're all the same.

182
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,233
All right, fine, I'll ask.

183
00:22:25,235 --> 00:22:28,103
<i>Are they all this wide?</i>

184
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:29,672
<i>Do you have any skinnier trees?</i>

185
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:29,672
Huh?

186
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:33,877
<i>Do you have any skinnier trees?</i>

187
00:22:34,745 --> 00:22:37,213
This is a little skinnier.

188
00:22:37,215 --> 00:22:39,617
That's not so bad actually.

189
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,254
Yeah, all right, fine.

190
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:45,324
All right,
hold it straight please.

191
00:22:47,226 --> 00:22:49,896
<i>All right, yeah, I'll send it.</i>

192
00:22:49,898 --> 00:22:51,764
<i>Just gonna be a minute.</i>

193
00:22:51,766 --> 00:22:53,833
<i>Yeah, you get it yet?</i>

194
00:22:53,835 --> 00:22:56,670
<i>Sure, I love your tortellini.</i>

195
00:22:56,838 --> 00:22:58,772
<i>What about that tuna thing?</i>

196
00:22:58,774 --> 00:23:00,240
<i>All right.</i>

197
00:23:00,242 --> 00:23:03,178
<i>I don't know, 4 feet.</i>
<i>How tall is that?</i>

198
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:03,178
Yeah, 4 feet.

199
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:03,178
<i>It's gonna come up</i>
<i>to your chest.</i>

200
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:09,118
<i>All right, fine.</i>
<i>I'll stand next to the next one.</i>

201
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,053
<i>What do you call it?</i>

202
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:13,389
- It's a balsam fir.
- Balsam fir.

203
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,892
It's like the wood,
it's super light.

204
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,862
- How light is this?
- It's pretty light.

205
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,766
No, it's not that light.
Why is it so heavy?

206
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:23,134
<i>I mean, it's a Christmas tree.</i>

207
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,904
<i>It's not... you might be thinking</i>
<i>of balsa wood.</i>

208
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:28,007
<i>Oh, balsa wood.</i>

209
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:31,410
- And this is?
- This is a balsam fir.

210
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:35,682
<i>Balsam fir.</i>
<i>Okay, I guess she don't like it.</i>

211
00:23:35,684 --> 00:23:37,317
What else you got?

212
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:41,656
Well, we got Douglas firs,
something like this.

213
00:23:41,658 --> 00:23:44,826
<i>All right, hold it up though.</i>

214
00:23:44,828 --> 00:23:46,895
<i>You gotta hold it</i>
<i>straight, man.</i>

215
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,201
<i>All right, I got it,</i>
<i>I'm sending it.</i>

216
00:23:51,202 --> 00:23:52,769
<i>Okay, I got it,</i>
<i>I'm sending it to you.</i>

217
00:23:52,771 --> 00:23:55,839
<i>Oh shit, I forgot</i>
<i>to stand next to it.</i>

218
00:24:02,348 --> 00:24:04,215
All right, if you guys are
gonna get coffee every morning,

219
00:24:04,217 --> 00:24:06,718
you gotta get back by 9.

220
00:24:07,186 --> 00:24:09,468
I've been working a 12-hour
shift, I just wanna go to bed.

221
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,457
All right, we work
12 hours too, man.

222
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:13,225
<i>Yeah, and I'm never late</i>
<i>to relieve you.</i>

223
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:15,195
It's only 5 minutes,
all right, relax.

224
00:24:15,197 --> 00:24:17,330
You know what?
Is it too much to ask?

225
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:18,932
I've been sitting out
in the rain all night,

226
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:20,334
I just wanna go to bed.
Jesus Christ.

227
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:22,937
- All right.
- You want some muffin?

228
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:24,405
No.

229
00:25:07,858 --> 00:25:09,258
<i>Do you work here?</i>

230
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:13,797
<i>I can help you.</i>

231
00:25:13,998 --> 00:25:14,610
<i>Thank you.</i>

232
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:21,439
<i>These are all</i>
<i>the most beautiful.</i>

233
00:25:25,812 --> 00:25:27,513
- Hi.
- Hey.

234
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:30,082
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

235
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,552
<i>No, I meet a lot of people.</i>

236
00:25:32,554 --> 00:25:34,821
<i>Do you work nights here?</i>

237
00:25:34,823 --> 00:25:36,156
<i>Just 'til 9.</i>

238
00:25:36,158 --> 00:25:37,825
<i>And who works after 9?</i>

239
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,161
- The night guy.
- Is he here?

240
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,163
<i>He's inside.</i>
<i>Can I help you with something?</i>

241
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,564
<i>No, I just...</i>
<i>I've met him before.</i>

242
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:46,101
<i>I just need to ask him</i>
<i>a question.</i>

243
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,106
<i>Noel, you got a visitor.</i>

244
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,276
Hi.

245
00:25:56,247 --> 00:25:58,015
Hi.

246
00:25:58,449 --> 00:26:00,284
Do you remember me?

247
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:03,054
Yeah.

248
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:05,456
Can I come in?

249
00:26:06,225 --> 00:26:07,993
Okay.

250
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:17,571
Um, I don't really remember
what happened

251
00:26:18,005 --> 00:26:20,575
or how I got here.

252
00:26:25,214 --> 00:26:29,051
Um, I found you in the park
passed out on a bench.

253
00:26:29,986 --> 00:26:32,055
You found me in the park
passed out on a bench?

254
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:34,424
Yeah, and you were sitting
next to a homeless man

255
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:38,028
who had your cell phone,
and you only had one shoe on,

256
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,964
and you had gum in your hair.

257
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,033
<i>And it was freezing,</i>
<i>so I carried you back here</i>

258
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:46,438
<i>and laid you in bed, and cut</i>
<i>the gum out of your hair.</i>

259
00:26:51,144 --> 00:26:53,246
<i>Yeah, sorry,</i>
<i>I didn't know how to get it out.</i>

260
00:26:54,581 --> 00:26:57,384
<i>Um, and my other shoe?</i>

261
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,654
I didn't see it.
I didn't see a second shoe.

262
00:27:03,325 --> 00:27:06,060
This is pretty embarrassing.

263
00:27:07,162 --> 00:27:10,532
And my wallet?
I lost my wallet.

264
00:27:10,534 --> 00:27:12,501
You didn't see it anywhere?

265
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,169
No.

266
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:18,008
<i>And you have no idea</i>
<i>how I got there?</i>

267
00:27:18,476 --> 00:27:20,511
No.

268
00:27:22,614 --> 00:27:25,216
<i>All right, well, thanks anyway.</i>

269
00:27:47,077 --> 00:27:48,977
Can I get a holiday riches?

270
00:27:49,512 --> 00:27:52,248
Okay. What else?

271
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,717
And a 6-hour energy.

272
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,353
- Six hour.
- That's it.

273
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:58,655
<i>That's it?</i>

274
00:27:58,657 --> 00:28:00,724
- Thank you, have a good day.
- Thanks.

275
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:09,635
Anything I need to know?

276
00:28:09,637 --> 00:28:11,236
This Fraser sold.

277
00:28:11,238 --> 00:28:12,738
The woman's coming back
tomorrow morning.

278
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,341
All right.

279
00:28:14,343 --> 00:28:17,344
Oh, and baler netting,
we couldn't find any.

280
00:28:17,346 --> 00:28:19,079
Should be in the closet.

281
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:21,983
<i>Actually, neither of us</i>
<i>have ever changed it,</i>

282
00:28:21,985 --> 00:28:25,152
so would you mind
showing us how?

283
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:26,488
Yeah, I don't like
to waste any,

284
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,423
so I'll just change it
when it runs out later.

285
00:28:28,425 --> 00:28:31,426
I mean, it's easy.
You just gotta figure it out.

286
00:28:31,428 --> 00:28:33,429
All right, see you later.

287
00:28:33,431 --> 00:28:36,032
<i>Oh, oh, oh, what's the deal</i>
<i>with deliveries?</i>

288
00:28:36,034 --> 00:28:36,032
<i>What do you mean?</i>

289
00:28:36,034 --> 00:28:39,403
<i>Well, the sign</i>
<i>says we gladly deliver.</i>

290
00:28:39,405 --> 00:28:41,005
<i>Up to you.</i>

291
00:28:41,007 --> 00:28:42,706
If we deliver
or if we do it gladly?

292
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:42,706
Either.

293
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:46,111
<i>Well, I told this woman</i>
<i>that we do it.</i>

294
00:28:46,113 --> 00:28:47,512
Yeah, the day guy
usually takes care of it

295
00:28:47,514 --> 00:28:49,280
at the end of his shift.

296
00:28:49,282 --> 00:28:51,417
- Where is it?
- The other side of town.

297
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:54,053
- Take the truck.
- Okay.

298
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:35,435
<i>There is always</i>
<i>the hunter and the hunted,</i>

299
00:29:35,437 --> 00:29:37,604
<i>the pursuer and the pursued.</i>

300
00:29:37,606 --> 00:29:39,506
<i>It may be the voice</i>
<i>of authority</i>

301
00:29:39,508 --> 00:29:41,742
<i>or a race with death</i>
<i>and destruction,</i>

302
00:29:41,744 --> 00:29:44,345
<i>the most relentless</i>
<i>of the hunters.</i>

303
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:46,614
<i>There are times when laughter</i>
<i>is heard as counterpoint,</i>

304
00:29:46,616 --> 00:29:49,384
<i>and moments when sheer terror</i>
<i>is the theme!</i>

305
00:29:54,257 --> 00:29:56,693
<i>But always, there is the chase.</i>

306
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,738
<i>Come in, my dear.</i>

307
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:10,742
<i>It was almost unbelievable.</i>

308
00:30:10,744 --> 00:30:12,344
<i>When he recovered</i>
<i>consciousness,</i>

309
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:16,216
<i>he lay on the floor, staring,</i>

310
00:30:16,218 --> 00:30:18,885
<i>until I summoned</i>
<i>the authorities.</i>

311
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,504
<i>And you sell stands too?</i>

312
00:30:34,506 --> 00:30:36,439
Yeah, you need one?

313
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:43,681
<i>How does it work?</i>

314
00:30:43,683 --> 00:30:45,550
Three screws through the holes.

315
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,519
And then I fill it with water?

316
00:30:50,157 --> 00:30:51,924
<i>Water. Do I put water in it?</i>

317
00:30:51,926 --> 00:30:54,393
Yeah, water.
Fill it with water.

318
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,463
<i>How often do I refill it?</i>

319
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:59,399
Whenever it gets empty.

320
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:10,345
<i>So basically he asked me out</i>
<i>to laser tag,</i>

321
00:31:10,347 --> 00:31:12,581
<i>but I obviously...</i>

322
00:31:14,451 --> 00:31:16,886
hi, do you have the Obama tree?

323
00:31:16,888 --> 00:31:18,488
What?

324
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,924
The Christmas tree
that the Obama's have.

325
00:31:19,926 --> 00:31:24,662
It's the Colorado blue spruce.
It's from Ohio.

326
00:31:24,664 --> 00:31:26,331
Yeah, we have
some blue spruces.

327
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:27,899
Oh, is it from Ohio?

328
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:29,968
- Yeah, the seeds are.
- Oh, cool.

329
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,837
It's from here, grown here.

330
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,973
Oh, a local tree.

331
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:39,646
I don't have to tell you the
Curbers come out of your share.

332
00:31:40,615 --> 00:31:43,551
- Yeah, it'll pick up.
- No one else is so far behind.

333
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:45,220
<i>Talk to Nick, he's the day guy.</i>

334
00:31:45,222 --> 00:31:46,955
<i>Day guy?</i>

335
00:31:46,957 --> 00:31:49,758
<i>You talked me</i>
<i>into giving you the night shift.</i>

336
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,794
You vouched
for Nick what's-his-name

337
00:31:51,796 --> 00:31:53,929
and his girlfriend.

338
00:31:56,434 --> 00:31:58,235
Sell trees.

339
00:32:10,717 --> 00:32:12,751
Hi.

340
00:32:16,924 --> 00:32:21,829
Listen, I felt a little bad
for the way I acted before.

341
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,664
I should have been
more appreciative

342
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:25,433
for what you did for me.

343
00:32:31,975 --> 00:32:33,843
<i>It's pumpkin.</i>

344
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:37,346
What is this?

345
00:32:38,516 --> 00:32:40,284
These?

346
00:32:40,286 --> 00:32:41,852
These are blackberries.

347
00:32:41,854 --> 00:32:44,022
My mom does it.

348
00:32:44,657 --> 00:32:47,859
- Your mom made that?
- No, I made it.

349
00:32:49,763 --> 00:32:51,730
So, did you figure out
what happened?

350
00:32:51,865 --> 00:32:53,432
<i>Psh, no.</i>

351
00:32:53,434 --> 00:32:55,969
<i>I just drank too much.</i>

352
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:58,638
I think I drank goldschlãger.

353
00:33:03,645 --> 00:33:07,048
- So, this is where you live?
- Yeah.

354
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,651
<i>You're not from here?</i>

355
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:12,054
No, I live upstate.

356
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,591
You must love this.

357
00:33:16,093 --> 00:33:18,961
- Love this?
- Yeah, the excitement.

358
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:21,732
I mean, living in a camper
on the streets of New York,

359
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:24,668
spreading Christmas spirit.

360
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:29,007
<i>Yeah, I guess</i>
<i>it's a good contrast.</i>

361
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:31,477
<i>From what?</i>

362
00:33:33,714 --> 00:33:36,048
My regular life, I guess.

363
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:41,922
So, what do you do
with the leftover trees?

364
00:33:43,024 --> 00:33:44,926
There aren't any.

365
00:33:45,094 --> 00:33:47,962
- Never?
- No.

366
00:33:47,964 --> 00:33:50,399
What if there are?

367
00:33:50,401 --> 00:33:52,901
- There's not.
- Why not?

368
00:33:52,903 --> 00:33:54,870
'Cause we got it down
to a science.

369
00:33:54,872 --> 00:33:58,775
<i>But let's say</i>
<i>divine intervention.</i>

370
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:03,481
<i>Little baby Jesus comes down</i>
<i>because it's Christmas</i>

371
00:34:03,483 --> 00:34:05,850
and he and the wise men
stand on that corner

372
00:34:05,852 --> 00:34:08,420
and they tell everyone who
comes along not to buy a tree

373
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:10,689
because they won't
get into heaven,

374
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:12,991
and people listen, obviously,

375
00:34:12,993 --> 00:34:15,495
'cause it's Jesus
and it's Christmas.

376
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:18,765
Yeah, well, I guess
in that scenario

377
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,901
we would just leave 'em
on the curb?

378
00:34:20,903 --> 00:34:23,470
- For people to take?
- Sure.

379
00:34:23,472 --> 00:34:27,108
But you have no experience
with this, obviously.

380
00:34:29,512 --> 00:34:32,047
They all end up
on the curb eventually.

381
00:34:43,962 --> 00:34:46,130
This your crew?

382
00:34:46,132 --> 00:34:48,466
Old crew.

383
00:34:48,867 --> 00:34:55,475
<i>Aww, look at you.</i>

384
00:34:55,477 --> 00:34:57,544
<i>That your girlfriend?</i>

385
00:34:57,945 --> 00:35:00,046
<i>Used to be.</i>

386
00:35:05,954 --> 00:35:08,924
Listen, it's Noel, right?

387
00:35:09,459 --> 00:35:11,526
Yeah.

388
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,161
N-o-e-l?

389
00:35:13,163 --> 00:35:16,766
- Yeah.
- Who sells Christmas trees.

390
00:35:17,968 --> 00:35:20,737
Mm-hmm.

391
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:24,775
Thank you for helping me out
the other night.

392
00:36:22,944 --> 00:36:25,145
Are these all the wreaths
that you have?

393
00:36:25,848 --> 00:36:27,715
There's a couple more up front.

394
00:36:28,884 --> 00:36:33,656
Are there any without all
this stuff on it, just plain?

395
00:36:34,691 --> 00:36:36,292
Nope, just these.

396
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,295
Can you take
all this stuff off?

397
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,799
<i>Like, I don't need this,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

398
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,837
What... you just don't want...

399
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:51,343
<i>yeah, I don't need this,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

400
00:36:51,744 --> 00:36:54,913
- What do you mean?
- Like, without this.

401
00:36:54,915 --> 00:37:02,917
- You just want a plain wreath?
- Yeah.

402
00:37:05,695 --> 00:37:07,596
- Is that...
- Yeah.

403
00:37:07,598 --> 00:37:10,231
- Do it for $15.
- All right.

404
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:12,233
- So?
- Thanks.

405
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:17,073
Yeah, just throw
some hot water on it tonight,

406
00:37:17,075 --> 00:37:17,073
breaks open the sap.

407
00:37:17,075 --> 00:37:22,646
And then just regular tap water
after that, room temperature.

408
00:37:24,315 --> 00:37:26,384
Good to go, thanks.

409
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:31,957
Hey, what kind of tree is this?

410
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:35,127
That's a Douglas fir.

411
00:37:36,663 --> 00:37:39,232
- What about this one?
- These are Fraser firs.

412
00:37:39,234 --> 00:37:41,101
What's the difference?

413
00:37:41,103 --> 00:37:43,704
Fraser firs are most popular,
easiest to take care of,

414
00:37:43,706 --> 00:37:45,973
live the longest.

415
00:37:45,975 --> 00:37:47,842
They all have pretty much
the same shape.

416
00:37:47,844 --> 00:37:51,413
Douglas fir, more unique,
you got needles

417
00:37:51,415 --> 00:37:54,249
going all around the branches
to make it look fluffy.

418
00:37:55,352 --> 00:37:57,687
Which do the ladies like?

419
00:37:57,689 --> 00:37:59,255
Probably the Douglas fir.

420
00:37:59,257 --> 00:38:03,694
It has the most smell,
but it requires the most care.

421
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:09,067
What, like rub their feet?

422
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:10,669
No, you just gotta...

423
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:13,939
you can't put it
near sunlight or direct heat.

424
00:38:13,941 --> 00:38:16,909
You got a spray bottle, it's
a good idea to keep it misted.

425
00:38:18,211 --> 00:38:20,247
All right.

426
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,749
Women like 'em?

427
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,785
- Yeah.
- Cool.

428
00:38:24,787 --> 00:38:27,188
Let me... let me see this one.

429
00:38:31,761 --> 00:38:33,295
<i>Nice.</i>

430
00:38:33,297 --> 00:38:35,798
<i>Spin it.</i>

431
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,471
<i>Cool, yeah, I'll take it.</i>

432
00:38:41,806 --> 00:38:43,474
Seventy-two.

433
00:38:46,378 --> 00:38:48,846
- Hey, do you sell lights?
- Yep, white or colored?

434
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:50,415
<i>White.</i>

435
00:38:52,418 --> 00:38:54,352
<i>Hey, make it two.</i>

436
00:38:54,354 --> 00:38:56,022
<i>You got a couple packs at home?</i>

437
00:38:56,024 --> 00:38:57,457
<i>No, why?</i>

438
00:38:57,459 --> 00:38:59,092
You're gonna need
about four for that tree.

439
00:38:59,094 --> 00:39:02,162
<i>Four, really?</i>
<i>Hey, can you test them.</i>

440
00:39:02,164 --> 00:39:05,733
I got one home last year,
it didn't work.

441
00:39:06,234 --> 00:39:08,169
All right, yeah, come on in.

442
00:39:16,513 --> 00:39:18,380
Nice crib you got here, man.

443
00:39:20,518 --> 00:39:22,185
These are good.

444
00:39:25,257 --> 00:39:26,924
<i>These are good.</i>

445
00:39:30,496 --> 00:39:32,531
What are those, blackberries?

446
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:34,466
All good.

447
00:39:35,301 --> 00:39:37,437
- Are those blackberries?
- Huh?

448
00:39:37,439 --> 00:39:39,906
<i>Did you make that pie?</i>

449
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:42,408
No, some girl made it for me.

450
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,445
Your girlfriend?

451
00:39:44,946 --> 00:39:46,347
No.

452
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:48,783
Some girl stays here one night,
now she's baking pies for me.

453
00:39:50,987 --> 00:39:52,788
<i>Do you need a bag for this?</i>

454
00:39:53,256 --> 00:39:54,856
No.

455
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,804
You want an ornament, free?

456
00:40:06,806 --> 00:40:09,140
No.

457
00:40:09,142 --> 00:40:11,109
You sure?

458
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:14,013
Yeah, fine, give me one.

459
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,415
You want to pick one out?

460
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:20,220
The big one.

461
00:40:25,327 --> 00:40:27,094
<i>I don't need change.</i>

462
00:41:20,124 --> 00:41:22,459
<i>It's just one 4-foot Doug,</i>
<i>there's no stand.</i>

463
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,895
<i>Baby, you're dying.</i>

464
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,131
Let me just ask Noel
if he wants to do it.

465
00:41:27,366 --> 00:41:30,936
No, it's just one tree.
I can do it.

466
00:41:30,938 --> 00:41:33,238
<i>All right,</i>
<i>how 'bout I do it then.</i>

467
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,675
<i>Come on, it's pretty small and</i>
<i>it's a first floor apartment.</i>

468
00:41:37,978 --> 00:41:39,379
I can do it, come on.

469
00:41:39,381 --> 00:41:41,514
No, I feel like shit
but I'd rather do it myself

470
00:41:41,516 --> 00:41:43,083
than have you freeze.

471
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:44,551
It's fine,
I can handle one tree.

472
00:41:44,553 --> 00:41:46,387
I'll do it.

473
00:41:53,029 --> 00:41:55,131
- Coming.
- I got it.

474
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:56,699
<i>Oh honey, that thing is huge.</i>

475
00:41:56,701 --> 00:41:58,334
Come on in.

476
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:03,507
- Where do you want it?
- Straight back.

477
00:42:20,027 --> 00:42:21,561
Can I get one of you guys
to hold this up

478
00:42:21,563 --> 00:42:23,229
while I screw this in?

479
00:42:23,231 --> 00:42:25,733
Yeah, I got it.

480
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,341
Still look straight?

481
00:42:32,343 --> 00:42:34,609
<i>Yeah.</i>

482
00:42:35,078 --> 00:42:36,745
Okay, you can let go.

483
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:53,732
So, we're all set here.

484
00:42:53,734 --> 00:42:55,368
Cool, man,
thanks so much, here you go.

485
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,769
- Great.
- Thanks.

486
00:42:56,771 --> 00:42:59,238
Happy holidays.

487
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,008
You too.

488
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:20,633
Can I see this one?

489
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:25,773
<i>No, no, no, that one.</i>

490
00:45:07,189 --> 00:45:10,658
<i>Oh yeah, just tonight,</i>
<i>just throw some hot water on it.</i>

491
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:14,263
Helps absorb the... helps
the... break open the sap.

492
00:45:14,265 --> 00:45:15,664
Helps absorb better.

493
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:17,199
And then after that,
just normal...

494
00:45:17,201 --> 00:45:18,768
hey!

495
00:45:22,339 --> 00:45:23,806
<i>You all right?</i>

496
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,178
<i>You okay?</i>

497
00:49:35,234 --> 00:49:37,670
<i>Noel?</i>

498
00:49:37,904 --> 00:49:40,806
Noel? What the fuck, dude?
Wake up.

499
00:49:43,177 --> 00:49:45,011
I just fell asleep.

500
00:49:45,013 --> 00:49:52,587
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

501
00:51:13,717 --> 00:51:16,718
Those are trees?
Behind you, trees?

502
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,053
Yeah, trees.

503
00:51:18,055 --> 00:51:20,890
Yeah, you know,
they look perfect.

504
00:51:20,892 --> 00:51:23,259
Just perfect.

505
00:51:23,261 --> 00:51:26,763
But you see, this
is a Polish neighborhood,

506
00:51:26,765 --> 00:51:31,369
and in Poland,
trees have character.

507
00:51:31,837 --> 00:51:35,740
<i>They are not perfect,</i>
<i>but they have a character.</i>

508
00:51:37,077 --> 00:51:43,883
Like tonight, you go to a forest
and every tree is dressed.

509
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:51,626
Dressed in a wedding white...
like, brides all of them.

510
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:56,999
<i>But you must have an axe,</i>
<i>not a chainsaw.</i>

511
00:51:57,001 --> 00:51:59,101
<i>Chainsaw makes noise.</i>

512
00:51:59,636 --> 00:52:01,638
<i>Everybody gets scared.</i>

513
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,706
<i>Trees get scared.</i>

514
00:52:07,012 --> 00:52:08,712
Cheers!

515
00:52:09,047 --> 00:52:10,414
- Cheers.
- Do you work here?

516
00:52:10,416 --> 00:52:11,949
Oh, yeah.

517
00:52:11,951 --> 00:52:13,852
Do you have any decorated ones?

518
00:52:13,854 --> 00:52:16,988
Yeah, there's
a couple of 'em over here.

519
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:30,905
<i>Are you gonna get more?</i>

520
00:52:30,907 --> 00:52:34,142
I just make 'em myself,
so when we run out,

521
00:52:34,144 --> 00:52:37,946
I'll make a couple more.

522
00:52:37,948 --> 00:52:41,950
- Kinda sad, I know.
- No, this is lovely.

523
00:52:41,952 --> 00:52:44,454
<i>It's perfect.</i>

524
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:46,723
<i>Mistletoe?</i>

525
00:52:46,725 --> 00:52:48,826
<i>Holly.</i>

526
00:52:48,828 --> 00:52:51,996
<i>Juniper and noble fir.</i>

527
00:52:51,998 --> 00:52:55,801
- Pine?
- Yep, white pine.

528
00:52:55,803 --> 00:52:59,171
- And what's this?
- Western red cedar.

529
00:52:59,173 --> 00:53:01,107
<i>I love it.</i>

530
00:53:01,109 --> 00:53:03,276
<i>I love it.</i>

531
00:53:03,278 --> 00:53:05,478
What about the trees?

532
00:53:06,347 --> 00:53:09,783
<i>We have an artificial tree</i>
<i>where I work.</i>

533
00:53:09,785 --> 00:53:13,154
Everybody loves it,
but I just... i don't know.

534
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:16,291
I feel like it'd be so much
better if it was a real one.

535
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:19,929
Yeah, nothing beats
the real thing.

536
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:21,263
<i>It's not too late, is it?</i>

537
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:22,898
<i>No, not at all.</i>

538
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,435
<i>A lot of people wait</i>
<i>'til Christmas Eve,</i>

539
00:53:25,437 --> 00:53:27,370
spend all night decorating it.

540
00:53:27,372 --> 00:53:29,806
Wow.

541
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:32,110
- Do you deliver?
- Yeah.

542
00:53:32,112 --> 00:53:34,112
Can you deliver to bushwick?

543
00:53:34,114 --> 00:53:36,080
Sure.

544
00:53:36,082 --> 00:53:38,884
Earliest I can do would be
tomorrow night, though.

545
00:53:38,886 --> 00:53:40,753
That's all right.

546
00:53:40,755 --> 00:53:42,489
Can you deliver it
Christmas Eve,

547
00:53:42,491 --> 00:53:46,226
and then we can decorate it
like you said?

548
00:53:46,228 --> 00:53:49,463
Yeah, I got a couple more
deliveries Christmas Eve.

549
00:53:50,365 --> 00:53:52,867
Great.

550
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:52,867
So you want this one?

551
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:56,304
<i>Yeah, and the wreath.</i>

552
00:53:56,306 --> 00:53:58,240
<i>Okay.</i>

553
00:53:58,242 --> 00:53:59,775
Do I pay for it now?

554
00:53:59,777 --> 00:54:01,110
You can pay for it
when I deliver it.

555
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,212
<i>Oh, great.</i>

556
00:54:03,214 --> 00:54:05,948
<i>Here's the address</i>
<i>and the number is there too.</i>

557
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,918
<i>Okay.</i>

558
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,787
- All right.
- Fantastic.

559
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:12,323
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

560
00:54:24,338 --> 00:54:26,106
Morning.

561
00:54:47,231 --> 00:54:50,367
- Hey man, how you doing?
- Hey, how's it going out there?

562
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:54,272
Great, I sold 25 today
and a bunch of wreaths too.

563
00:54:54,274 --> 00:54:56,041
I think we might be out
by tomorrow.

564
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:59,277
Awesome man, great job.

565
00:55:00,146 --> 00:55:03,916
We're getting
the last load in tonight.

566
00:55:03,918 --> 00:55:05,451
Think you got
one more day in you?

567
00:55:05,453 --> 00:55:07,554
Should be okay.

568
00:55:11,192 --> 00:55:13,061
Tell you what, let me take
care of those deliveries for you

569
00:55:13,063 --> 00:55:14,596
tomorrow night.

570
00:55:14,598 --> 00:55:16,297
- Really?
- Yeah.

571
00:55:16,299 --> 00:55:18,199
That'd be great.

572
00:55:18,201 --> 00:55:20,236
I'm gonna finish up.

573
00:55:34,219 --> 00:55:36,288
- Not bad.
- Few more coming in?

574
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:38,190
Nope.

575
00:55:38,192 --> 00:55:39,958
- What?
- Too risky.

576
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,894
We're closing down early.

577
00:55:41,896 --> 00:55:44,430
Give me 20 more.
I'll have 'em all sold.

578
00:55:44,432 --> 00:55:47,033
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, you
know how busy the last day is.

579
00:55:47,035 --> 00:55:48,502
Curbers come out of your ass.

580
00:55:48,504 --> 00:55:51,639
There won't be any.

581
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:54,309
You'll have 15 more tomorrow.

582
00:56:10,262 --> 00:56:14,532
- There you go.
- Oh, great.

583
00:56:14,534 --> 00:56:17,101
- Thank you so much.
- All right, happy holidays!

584
00:56:27,983 --> 00:56:31,485
So, you lookin' for something
a little slimmer or is that...

585
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:34,021
<i>are you looking for anything</i>
<i>a little slimmer or is this...</i>

586
00:56:43,435 --> 00:56:45,134
<i>merry Christmas.</i>

587
00:57:03,992 --> 00:57:05,658
<i>I need the pan back.</i>

588
00:57:06,227 --> 00:57:08,328
- Excuse me?
- The pie pan, I need it back.

589
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:08,328
<i>I haven't cleaned it yet.</i>

590
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:11,498
<i>Please just</i>
<i>give me back the pan.</i>

591
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:13,568
<i>Are you serious? Yeah, okay.</i>

592
00:57:29,153 --> 00:57:30,688
Is everything all right?

593
00:57:38,598 --> 00:57:41,333
- This look like a 4'?
- Huh?

594
00:57:41,734 --> 00:57:43,336
Yeah, it's a 4'.

595
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:45,304
Tall 4', but
definitely not a 5'.

596
00:57:45,306 --> 00:57:46,672
Okay.

597
00:57:46,674 --> 00:57:48,275
Don't forget about the one
from last night.

598
00:57:48,277 --> 00:57:50,077
Yeah, it's in the truck already.
You're all good to go.

599
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,379
All right, thanks.

600
00:58:21,448 --> 00:58:23,749
Did you tell my boyfriend
we hooked up?

601
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:26,553
What?

602
00:58:26,555 --> 00:58:28,755
Why would you do that?

603
00:58:29,557 --> 00:58:31,592
He said he came and bought
a tree from you,

604
00:58:31,594 --> 00:58:34,695
and asked about the pie,
and you said we hooked up.

605
00:58:36,699 --> 00:58:38,366
That guy was your boyfriend?

606
00:58:38,368 --> 00:58:40,469
Yes, why would you say that?

607
00:58:40,471 --> 00:58:41,870
I didn't say anything.

608
00:58:41,872 --> 00:58:43,406
Well, then
why would he think that?

609
00:58:43,408 --> 00:58:46,542
I don't know.
I don't even know him.

610
00:58:49,214 --> 00:58:51,582
Uh...

611
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:56,488
I think he punched me
in the face yesterday.

612
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:58,857
What?

613
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:01,627
Somebody came up and clocked
me from behind and ran away.

614
00:59:01,761 --> 00:59:04,196
Sound like something he'd do?

615
00:59:07,368 --> 00:59:09,169
I think you should go home.

616
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:11,571
I'm locked out.

617
00:59:14,643 --> 00:59:18,280
Sorry, I just need a minute.

618
00:59:27,324 --> 00:59:29,726
Can I just hang here
for a second?

619
00:59:35,934 --> 00:59:38,303
I gotta go make some
deliveries.

620
00:59:39,372 --> 00:59:41,473
You wanna come?

621
01:00:27,661 --> 01:00:29,696
<i>Come on in, thanks for coming!</i>

622
01:00:29,698 --> 01:00:31,332
Sure.

623
01:00:31,334 --> 01:00:32,733
I drilled a hole,
it should be wide enough.

624
01:00:32,735 --> 01:00:34,635
<i>Thank you!</i>

625
01:00:34,637 --> 01:00:36,871
<i>Hi, guys.</i>

626
01:00:41,277 --> 01:00:42,945
You want this around here?

627
01:00:42,947 --> 01:00:44,981
<i>Oh, it's perfect, thank you.</i>

628
01:00:46,617 --> 01:00:48,919
<i>We got our tree</i>
<i>from you last year.</i>

629
01:00:48,921 --> 01:00:50,487
<i>Oh, great.</i>

630
01:00:50,489 --> 01:00:53,490
<i>How old is the tree?</i>

631
01:00:53,492 --> 01:00:56,661
This tree is about 5 years old.

632
01:00:56,929 --> 01:00:58,463
How old are you guys?

633
01:00:58,465 --> 01:01:01,400
- I'm 8.
- I'm 5.

634
01:01:01,402 --> 01:01:03,869
<i>Do you work for Santa?</i>

635
01:01:05,272 --> 01:01:07,507
Well, we're more
like colleagues.

636
01:01:08,909 --> 01:01:10,677
What is a colleague?

637
01:01:10,679 --> 01:01:12,947
People who work together.

638
01:01:13,415 --> 01:01:15,516
<i>Does that look good, straight?</i>

639
01:01:21,658 --> 01:01:24,827
- Great, thank you so much.
- Thank you.

640
01:01:24,829 --> 01:01:28,498
- All right guys.
- Merry Christmas, thank you.

641
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,967
- Enjoy.
- Bye.

642
01:02:00,704 --> 01:02:02,538
Maybe there's an elevator?

643
01:02:02,939 --> 01:02:05,607
There's never an elevator.
Is it open?

644
01:02:05,609 --> 01:02:07,444
Uh, yes.

645
01:02:24,965 --> 01:02:27,033
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>whose house this is?</i>

646
01:02:39,482 --> 01:02:41,082
Nice tree.

647
01:02:41,784 --> 01:02:43,486
Do you know
whose house this is?

648
01:02:43,488 --> 01:02:45,888
- No.
- Do you know a Matt?

649
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,924
Oh, I think he's back there.

650
01:02:49,527 --> 01:02:51,628
<i>Oh, excuse me.</i>

651
01:03:13,555 --> 01:03:15,556
<i>Hey, there's the tree.</i>

652
01:03:15,724 --> 01:03:18,059
- Is this your place?
- It is indeed.

653
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:20,095
Where do you want this?

654
01:03:20,097 --> 01:03:22,564
<i>Right there is fine.</i>

655
01:03:27,438 --> 01:03:30,441
I'm sorry about before,
the whole pie thing.

656
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:32,609
That's all right.
He'll get over it.

657
01:03:34,446 --> 01:03:36,714
How's your face?

658
01:03:37,817 --> 01:03:40,051
It's all right.

659
01:03:40,053 --> 01:03:41,821
I've been punched before.

660
01:03:44,724 --> 01:03:46,091
You know, I guess
I just got excited

661
01:03:46,093 --> 01:03:48,595
<i>somebody made a pie for me.</i>

662
01:04:07,151 --> 01:04:09,786
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?

663
01:04:09,788 --> 01:04:11,789
- Good.
- Thank you for coming.

664
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:13,858
<i>Sure, sure, sure.</i>

665
01:04:16,862 --> 01:04:19,798
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Oh, I'll show you... this way.</i>

666
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:57,074
How's it look?

667
01:05:00,713 --> 01:05:03,181
Ooh!

668
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:07,620
It's a hit.

669
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:12,893
All right.

670
01:05:14,563 --> 01:05:16,697
They just, they love it,
I can tell you.

671
01:05:16,699 --> 01:05:18,333
Yeah, great.

672
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:21,570
<i>Before you go,</i>
<i>can I give you something?</i>

673
01:05:21,771 --> 01:05:23,305
<i>Sure.</i>

674
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:27,143
<i>This is a tea flower.</i>

675
01:05:28,278 --> 01:05:32,082
You put it in your cup
of boiling water and it blooms.

676
01:05:33,251 --> 01:05:35,018
<i>It's very nice.</i>

677
01:05:35,687 --> 01:05:37,121
- Fair enough.
- I'll walk you guys out.

678
01:05:37,123 --> 01:05:40,291
- Great, thank you so much.
- Thank you, take care.

679
01:05:40,293 --> 01:05:42,628
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

680
01:05:45,332 --> 01:05:46,966
Should I drop you home?

681
01:05:49,303 --> 01:05:51,037
He's still not answering.

682
01:05:54,343 --> 01:05:56,210
Can we deliver more trees?

683
01:06:03,353 --> 01:06:05,253
You can come wait at the stand.

684
01:06:06,657 --> 01:06:08,124
Okay.

685
01:06:18,204 --> 01:06:21,139
- You need us to stay?
- No, you guys are good.

686
01:06:22,174 --> 01:06:24,243
Just see you in the morning
for the breakdown.

687
01:06:25,312 --> 01:06:27,313
Just one more left.

688
01:06:27,748 --> 01:06:29,281
Still could sell it.

689
01:06:30,284 --> 01:06:32,386
- All right guys.
- See you in a bit.

690
01:07:01,888 --> 01:07:03,455
So, what's next?

691
01:07:05,124 --> 01:07:06,926
What do you mean?

692
01:07:06,928 --> 01:07:09,929
<i>You can't sell Christmas</i>
<i>trees all year.</i>

693
01:07:09,931 --> 01:07:12,733
<i>I build houses</i>
<i>the rest of the year.</i>

694
01:07:12,735 --> 01:07:14,301
<i>It's pretty dead through march.</i>

695
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:18,373
We used to spend
January traveling.

696
01:07:19,975 --> 01:07:22,243
You know what,
you wanna play some cards?

697
01:07:22,245 --> 01:07:24,246
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

698
01:07:31,322 --> 01:07:33,223
<i>What do you wanna play?</i>

699
01:07:35,994 --> 01:07:39,297
<i>Well, I usually play solitaire.</i>

700
01:07:41,033 --> 01:07:43,102
<i>Do you want me to watch?</i>

701
01:07:48,175 --> 01:07:50,443
- Gin rummy?
- Okay.

702
01:07:52,379 --> 01:07:54,148
<i>Do you know how to play?</i>

703
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:55,916
Yes I do.

704
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:04,926
I lost count, was that ten?

705
01:08:04,928 --> 01:08:07,096
<i>I wasn't counting.</i>

706
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:15,939
Hey sorry,
I don't really wanna play.

707
01:08:18,244 --> 01:08:20,278
<i>That's fine.</i>

708
01:08:29,924 --> 01:08:35,328
- You got that tea flower?
- Mm-hmm.

709
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:37,799
<i>Do you have a kettle?</i>

710
01:08:37,801 --> 01:08:39,867
Sure do.

711
01:08:45,909 --> 01:08:47,342
<i>Kettle.</i>

712
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:52,415
<i>How about something</i>
<i>to put it in?</i>

713
01:08:52,817 --> 01:08:55,519
Something clear, possibly.

714
01:08:55,854 --> 01:08:58,489
Yeah, there's a jar over there.

715
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,575
- Wanna take the label off?
- Yes.

716
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:24,133
- What's going on?
- The generator ran out of gas.

717
01:13:24,135 --> 01:13:25,767
<i>What time is it?</i>

718
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:27,636
<i>It's around 3.</i>

719
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:30,507
<i>I should go.</i>

720
01:13:34,845 --> 01:13:36,814
<i>The tea flower.</i>

721
01:13:41,153 --> 01:13:42,754
<i>I'm gonna go.</i>

722
01:13:43,556 --> 01:13:45,423
<i>Just a second.</i>
