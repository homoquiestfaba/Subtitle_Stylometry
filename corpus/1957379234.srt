00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,416
[man] How was the jog?

12
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,333
It was good.

13
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,791
Hurry up and get out of there.
This place is supposed to be fun.

14
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,083

What?

18
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:41,958
You look beautiful.

19
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,950
- [man] All right.
- All right.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,708
- [man] You ready?
- Yep.

21
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:52,791
[man] Let's go.

22
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,333
[chuckles] Wow. No phones?

23
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,000
This is a real-deal date night. Okay.

24

25

- L...
- [pop music playing]

00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,208
[woman] T.

27
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,291
[man] "Gestalt" is a person. Sorry.

28
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,593
- And a word.
- That's an interesting theory.

29
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,250
- It's also one of those fact thingies.
- [chuckles]

30
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,000
- I'm gonna challenge you.
- Okay.

31
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,333
[pages flipping]

32
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:35,041
"Gestalt. An organized whole
that is perceived as more than..." Damn it.

33
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,163
- Are you sure you wanna keep fighting?
- Yeah, yeah.

34
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,333
It's just that I'm so much better
than you. I'm sorry. [laughs]

35
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,125
By the way,
speaking of an organized whole...

36
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,375
Beg your pardon?

37
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,750
I was referring to our housewarming party.

38
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,125
- But in the weirdest way possible.
- [laughs]

39
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,166
- [giggles]
- I sent out that Evite this morning.

40
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,375
Oh, yes. Thank you for doing that.

41
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,666
[pen clicks]

42
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,416
[woman] Oops...

43
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,416
Two...

44
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,916
So, did you, uh... did you feel anything?

45
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,416
Huh?

46
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,833
I noticed you checking in the shower.

47
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Mm.

48
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,458
Okay. That makes sense.

49
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:21,208
Now, that's why you were
looking at me like that at the house.

50
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,250
Listen to me.

51
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,916
If it happens again,

52
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,416
we'll deal with it again.

53
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,625
Together.

54
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,958
Loser still has to do the laundry.

55
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,625
I hate you so much.

56
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,458
- [softly] I hate you too.
- [laughs]

57
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:43,958
Come here.

58
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,375
All right. Gimme that.

59
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,635
You're still good
with the party on the 18th?

60
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,186
'Cause that's what I put on the Evite.

61
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,125
Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I think that's perfect.

62
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,750
Any later than that,
and it gets too close to Thanksgiving...

63
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,541
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.
Wait a minute. Come here.

64
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,208
[crickets chirping]

65
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,291
What?

66
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,708
I'm proud of what we built.

67
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,708
- [woman] Well, you built it.
- [man] Yeah. But I built it for you.

68
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:10,916
- I built it for us.
- [sighs]

69
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,541
- How about a movie?
- [keys jangling]

70
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,625
Movie? I thought this was a date night.

71
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,791
That is a much better idea.

72
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,291
What?

73
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,041
Did you leave the back door open?

74
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,041
No.

75
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,708
[menacing music playing]

76
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,541
Henry?

77
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,375
Henry?

78
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,416
[hurried footsteps]

79
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,958
[Henry] No. The back door was closed...
- [gasps]

80
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,041
[breathing heavily]

81
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,791
[menacing music playing]

82
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,541
[door closes]

83
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,583
Hey. You okay?

84
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,666
Yeah. I, um...

85
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,500
What if they tried to hurt us?

86
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,333
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

87
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:36,250
Listen, they just...
they just wanted our stuff.

88
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,416
Really?

89
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,416
Yeah.

90
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,625
Okay. Then why didn't they take anything?

91
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,375
[sighs] I don't know.

92
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,083
It's kind of embarrassing, really.

93
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,416
Yeah. I mean, what's wrong with our stuff?

94
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Right?

95
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,833
We have good stuff.

96
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,000
[woman sighs]

97
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,916
I'm gonna have one more look around. Okay?
I'll be right up.

98
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,416
Okay.

99
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,625
[tense piano music playing]

100
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,000
[sighs deeply]

101
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,250
[boy] I think it's getting
a little better.

102
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,166
[muffled]
I don't always feel so mad at her.

103
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,500
- [breathing heavily]
- [boy] The breathing exercises...

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,101
I think about having to change schools
and everything,

105
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,845
and I just get pissed
at her all over again.

106
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,083
Well, moving can be difficult.

107
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,791
[chuckling] It sucks.

108
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,791
Well, it depends where you move to.

109
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,916
You know,
you might even like the East Coast. I did.

110
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,250
- Did you grow up there?
- No. No.

111
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,375
I grew up in India,
and then I moved to Boston for university.

112
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,083
- What made you stay?
- My husband. We met there.

113
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,458
What did he do to convince you?
Maybe it'd work on my mom.

114
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,541
[chuckles]

115
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,875
Well, he, um,
wooed me with a cheap souvenir.

116
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,125
Uh, he bought me a clock
on our first date.

117
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,791
That's kind of a weird gift.

118
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,250
- No offense.
- [sighs] I still have that clock.

119
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,583
So, basically,
you're saying I should bribe her?

120
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:23,041
Basically, I'm saying
maybe you should not be so pissed at her.

121
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,750
Not for trying to be a good mom.

122
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,458
Were your kids pissed at you
for moving here?

123
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,833
Mm. We... We don't... We don't have any kids.

124
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,333
No.

125
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,333
[notification chimes]

126
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
[melancholy music playing]

127
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,798
[receptionist]
You know, I can get you in on...

128
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,833
Hi, Mom. Thanks.

129
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,291
How about the 23rd? You wanna get some...

130
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,708
[papers rustling]

131
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,625
[doorbell rings]

132
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,500
[door opens]

133
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,916
- [Henry] Hi. Can I help you?
- Mr. Parsons.

134
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,833
Detective Morse.

135
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:15,958
Corrales PD.

136
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,875
Hi. Yeah, um... Come on in.

137
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,500
[Morse] Two cell phones and one laptop.

138
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,291
That's it?

139
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,250
Pretty specific list of items they took.

140
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,245
Why'd you and your wife
leave your cell phones behind?

141
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,458
We used to be tied to 'em. Especially me.

142
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,666
And we decided when we moved

143
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,541
that when we're together,
nothing should get in the way of it.

144
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,125
[chuckles]

145
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,791
- How long the two of you been married?
- Twelve years.

146
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,791
And when did you move to Corrales?

147
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,666
Came out about a year ago to break ground,

148
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,916
and then we finally moved in
about two months ago.

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,458
Boston's a rat race, and we were looking
for the exact opposite.

150
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,291
[exhaling] Make any enemies
since you've been here?

151
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,625
Uh, um...

152
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:06,333
I don't think what happened
was anything personal. Why? Do you?

153
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,166
Part of what we're trying to figure out.

154
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,708
What about back in Boston?

155
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,666
Back in Boston?

156
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,750
[Morse] Did you leave
any enemies behind there?

157
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:19,375
None that would fly across the country
to... to break into my home. No.

158
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:20,958
[scoffs, inhales sharply]

159
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,583
[chuckles softly]

160
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,333
It's a nice place.

161
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,958
It's big.

162
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:28,958
You design it yourself?

163
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,833
- Yep.
- Hmm.

164
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,833
What? [chuckles]

165
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:38,250
I'm just surprised you didn't install
an alarm system, that's all.

166
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,083
Well, I was under the impression
that Corrales was safe.

167
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,833
[chuckles softly]

168
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,208
How long were you and your wife gone
from the house that night?

169
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,833
- Couple hours.
- So, two?

170
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,876
- Yeah. Like, two or three.
- Which? Two or three?

171
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,458
I'm trying to put together
a timeline here. So, I'd need to know...

172
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,958
My wife is rattled about what happened.
Okay? And I know you are doing your job.

173
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,166
- I am.
- [Henry] My job's to make her feel safe.

174
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,750
So what can I tell her you guys are doing
that might make that happen?

175
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,708
[pipes rattle]

176
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,375
[pipes groan]

177
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,000
Sounds like you need a plumber.

178
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,833
I'll add it to the list.

179
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:19,833
You tell her...

180
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,583
[pen clicks]

181
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,458
...we're tracking a few leads.

182
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,833
- [insects chittering]
- [suspenseful music swells]

183
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,375
[inhaling]

184
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,208
[indistinct muffled dialogue]

185
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,666
[breathing heavily]

186
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,916
[suspenseful music swells]

187
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,791
- [phone ringing, door closes]
- So, good news.

188
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,958
The lump you felt was probably
just a residual build-up of scar tissue.

189
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,500
- Oh.
- I see no indication of cancer returning.

190
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,333
[sighs] Okay.

191
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:00,250
Okay. I just, um...
I just... just wanted to be really sure.

192
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,500
Of course. Here, you can keep a copy.

193
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,666
Yeah. Thank you.

194
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,375
[exhaling sharply]

195
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,041
How are you feeling otherwise?

196
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm... I'm okay. Just... just very tired.

197
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,500
I, um, heard about the break-in.

198
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,958
Corrales is a small town.

199
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,416
What you don't hear about at church,
you read about in the police log.

200
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:29,833
I know this is your field,
but if you ever need to speak to someone...

201
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,083
Oh. No. No. [chuckles]
Thank you so much. I'm... I'm okay.

202
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,125
- You're sure?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

203
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:39,041
My... my husband, he helps in that way.

204
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,416
A lot, actually.

205
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:46,083
He's really good at, um, at being there
and dealing with all my stuff.

206
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,291
[melancholy music plays]

207
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:51,583
He could have walked away.
Most people would have in that position.

208
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:56,041
And I was impossible
to be around sometimes,

209
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,083
but he stayed with me
and supported me through all of it.

210
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:05,083
- Idiot.
- [both laugh]

211
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,875
[birds chirping]

212

[thunder rumbling]

217
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:10,708
[seat belt clicking]

218
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,625
[folk music playing]

219
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,875
- Henry?
- [Henry] In here.

220
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,875
Actually, wait a second.

221
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,125
- [clanking]
- What's happening?

222
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,250
[Henry] Okay. Come on in.

223
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,333
[laughs] Okay.

224
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
Ta-da!

225
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,333
[gasps]

226
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,250
- You fixed our pictures.
- Yeah. And the shelf.

227
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,916
And the hallway light,
and the... the desk chair.

228
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,416
But, hey, who's counting? Right?

229
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,625
Wow. Look at you.

230
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,416
Oh.

231
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,750
- [clicks music off]
- [laughing]

232
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,916
Oh. Hold on.
This wasn't here before. Was it?

233
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,416
No. I added some new ones.

234
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,666
- Hmm.
- Oh.

235
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,416
Aren't you the best?

236
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,166
Yeah. Well, nothing inspires you
like a good burglary.

237
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,208
- [kisses, chuckles]
- [sighs]

238
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,083
Hey. I noticed
the light and locks you installed.

239
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,375
- Are you expecting to need them?
- It's just me being me.

240
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,500
I also bought us two new phones.

241
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,416
- Oh.
- Uh-huh.

242
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,041
And I installed
a location tracker app, so,

243
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,458
you know, if you ever get worried
about being alone...

244
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,541
[woman exhales]

245
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,833
Did you also get a new computer?

246
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:36,916
[pages turning]

247
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Henry?

248
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,708
Henry.

249
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,416
Come on. You can't be mad at me for this.

250
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,125
I just wanted to be sure
before I said something to you.

251
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,166
But we can't hide things
from each other, Meera.

252
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,375
We... We're not that couple.

253
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,583
You're... You're right.

254
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,466
I just didn't wanna worry you
if there was nothing to be worried about.

255
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,125
I need to know these things.
How else am I gonna take care of you?

256
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,208
Is everything okay?

257
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine.

258
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,000
[melancholy music playing]

259
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,083
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,666
[Henry] Come here.

261
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,041
I love you so much.

262
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:23,875
I love you too.

Henry?

271
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,625
- Henry.
- Hmm?

272
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,291
The power's out.

273
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:00,416
Looks like it rained earlier.
The storm probably knocked it out.

274
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,250
[breathing heavily]

275
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,875
I'll check the generator.

00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:29,708
[glass breaking]

356
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,375
[indistinct chattering]

357
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:49,166
[man] All right, buddy. Come out with me.

359
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,708
How long had it been there in the house?

360
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:58,791
I had it back in Boston too.

361
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,833
I thought we were not "that couple."

362
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:07,386
Would you have let me keep it in the house
if you had known about it?

363
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:10,750
- No.
- That is exactly why I did not tell you.

364
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:15,666
It's gone now.

365
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:18,000
- The cops have it.
- Yeah.

366
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,458
Instead of it being stashed
in one of my plants.

367
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:22,666
I thought it was a good idea.

368
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,625
A fantastic idea. Every home
should have a hidden weapons cache.

369
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,416
It was one gun.

370
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,916
And we're lucky we had it.

371
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,125
Okay. They're here.

372
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:46,166
[indistinct chatter]

373
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:53,708
Here they are.

374
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,291
[detective clears throat]

375
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:06,125
- Who... who are they?
- They're from Eagle Point.

376
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:08,958
It's a trailer park across town.

377
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:11,916
[detective] Poor community.
A lot more crime than around here.

378
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,750
He was a career criminal.
Mostly drug-related.

379
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,500
Same for these other two.

380
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,166
We plan on questioning him if we can.

381
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:23,458
Who?

382
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:28,041
He's in the ICU at Saint Mary's.

383
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,750
- It's not looking good.
- Wait. They're... they're still alive?

384
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:35,166
- Just him.
- Troopers are gonna wanna talk to him too.

385
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:38,541
- I'm sure.
- What are you talking about?

386
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:40,541
Who are these people?

387
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,142
I know some of their names and faces,
some of the stuff that they've done,

388
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:45,458
but beyond that...

389
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,875
I might even peg them
for what happened to you folks. Maybe.

390
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:52,166
You know it seems to fit...

391
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:55,791
but there's another matter.

392
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,708
A girl from around here
has been missing for a month.

393
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:05,708
[Morse] Christine Cobb.

394
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,750
Freshman at the community college.

395
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:13,916
State Police think that these men have
something to do with her disappearance.

396
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,416
And the thing is,
if this guy doesn't pull through,

397
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,666
they might never find her.

398
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:23,500
Gosh. Her poor family.

399
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:29,125
I don't think you understand, ma'am.

400
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,750
These men <i>are</i> her family.

401
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:34,833
[tense music playing]

402
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,458

[chopping]

405
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,625
Fixed my drafting table.

406
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:09,708
You're leaving?

407
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:14,041
Yeah. I'm just gonna get the rest
of the stuff for the housewarming party.

408
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,291
You still wanna have it?

409
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:19,666
Yeah. Yeah. I think it'd be good for us.
Don't you?

410
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:22,791
[chopping]

411
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,708
I'm not gonna be gone long,
I'm just going downtown to Grayson's.

412
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,416
They close at eight on Sundays.

413
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,708
Are you okay staying here?

414
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:33,583
Or you could just not worry
about the party.

415
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,875
- Meera.
- Or fixing furniture.

416
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:36,875
Stop.

417
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:38,976
For God's sakes,
you're acting like nothing happened.

418
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yes. I am trying to.

419
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:45,125
- You killed these people.
- Who were going to kill us.

420
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,708
But still, does that...
does that even register for you?

421
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:51,583
Of course, it does!
It makes me sick to my stomach!

422
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:52,791
[scoffs]

423
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:56,166
Apparently, not enough
to make you shirk on social obligations.

424
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,666
- We have to get past this.
- It just happened! Okay?

425
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:05,291
What if there are more of them out there?

426
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:09,625
How... how do we get past that?

427
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,583
[melancholy music playing]

428
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,291
You're... you're scared.

429
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,708
I am too.

430
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:24,250
But we... we have been scared before,

431
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:26,333
and we got through it...

432
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,791
together by fixing the damage.

433
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:32,958
[Meera breathes shakily]

434
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,041
[softly] Hey.

435
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:36,875
By inviting friends over,

436
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,875
I'm just... I'm... I'm...

437
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,166
I'm just trying
to get back to normal. That's it.

438
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,000
[Meera breathes heavily]

439
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:50,291
I can... I can go to the store another day.

440
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:52,458
No. No, no, no. Just...

441
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,416
Just, um... [sniffles]

442
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:58,875
Just go.

443
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:00,375
[sniffles]

444
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:02,458
You sure?

445
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:06,250
Yeah. I'm sure. I'll be okay.

446
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,125
I love you, you know.

447
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:13,250
I love you too.

Oh.

453
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:41,208
Henry?

454
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:44,041
[car departing]

455
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,208

You've reached Henry Parsons.</i>

<i>Please leave a message. </i>[beeps]

457
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:58,416
Hey. Hey. It's me. It's me.

458
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Well, you're not gonna have
much luck paying

459
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,375
'cause you left your wallet here.

460
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:05,500
Uh, hopefully, you'll listen to this
before you get there.

461
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,375
[smacks lips] Okay. Bye.

Um, you know, I...

466
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,750
You know what? I think I'm gonna try
and catch up to you with it.

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,666
Hey! Where you been?
Did you go for a drive or something?

475
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,833
I tried calling you.

476
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:01,750
Oh shit. Yeah.
It went straight to voicemail. Sorry.

477
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:04,333
Is something wrong?

478
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,791
I... I got into an accident.

479
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:12,708
Oh my... Oh my God. Are you okay?

480
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:16,750
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I... I was just trying to catch up to you,

481
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:20,250
and you turned off away from town
towards a hospital.

482
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:24,916
Yeah. I made a wrong turn.
I barely made it to... to Grayson's on time.

483
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,583
Oh, right. [chuckles]

484
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:31,708
I realized it, but, thankfully,

485
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:33,711
the owner said
I could come back next week, so...

486
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,208
- Gotta love small towns. Huh?
- Yeah.

Where's your car now?

489
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:48,041
Uh, they towed it to a body shop.
I just took an Uber home.

490
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,750
Okay. I'll take care of it.

491
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,958
Don't worry.
Good thing is you're okay. Right?

[woman] Oh, I almost forgot. Um...

508
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,833
- I'm sorry about your party.
- What?

509
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:34,916
The housewarming party?
I... I got the Evite cancellation.

Oh. Okay.

511
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:39,041
Okay.

God.

513
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,250
Heard about your accident. You okay?

514
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:12,416
Yeah. I'm fine.

Well, it's my husband's.

There's, uh,
something I think you should know.

519
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:31,375
The man who broke into your house,
the one that was still alive?

520
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,375
He's not anymore.

521
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,583
Um. Well, um...

522
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:38,875
Wasn't he in the ICU or something?

523
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:41,333
And showing signs of improvement.

524
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:43,625
Anyway,

525
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:48,750
I figured you might feel better
knowing that it's over.

526
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:52,208
Thank you.

00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:57,750

Oh. Um...

607
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:56,916
Uh. You know, I, um, texted you,
and I got a little worried.

Thing said you were near Eagle Point or...

609
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:05,291
Oh. Sorry. I actually did come
in here earlier. I... I was gonna vacuum.

I... I came in here
and didn't need to do anything.

So... [chuckles nervously]

615
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:19,750

About what you...
you were doing across town earlier.

Nothing. Just...

625

- Just driving.
- To where?

626
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:03,166
Um. Ho-home.

627
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:05,625
From where?

628
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:08,083
From work.

629
00:50:08,166 --> 00:50:09,166
Hmm.

630
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,458

You're not hiding anything from me.
Are you?

635
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:53,733
What... What would I hide from you?

636
00:50:57,083 --> 00:50:58,500
What would I hide from you, Henry?

637
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:05,541
Results.

638
00:51:07,416 --> 00:51:10,083
Oh. Um... [chuckles nervously]

00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:30,458
I thought there was
a s-specialist or something

644
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:32,291
you've been going to around there.

645
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,208
Something you didn't wanna tell me. Hm.

[policeman 1] Hey. Wanna get out
of the car, man? Come on.

Let me go or I swear...

[Joanne] <i>Meera?
Meera, are you still there?</i>

678

Yeah. Y-Yes.
I'm... I'm... I'm here. I'm here. Um...

679
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:05,166
I'll come by later
and take care of everything.

00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:41,708
Hey.

688
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:44,875
Where... where have you been?
I've been trying to call you.

689
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:47,833
They found that missing girl.

690
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:51,250
Uh, they... they did? Is she okay?

691
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I don't think so.

692
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:55,958
How do you know?

693
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:00,875
Why does he have
one of your envelopes, Henry?

694
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:05,208
- Who?
- The man who broke into our house.

695
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,000
I went to his trailer.

696
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:10,625
Two days after you did.

697
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:16,916
[inhales]

698
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,250
I need you to tell me
you have nothing to do

699
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:22,791
with any of this, Henry.

700
00:56:23,375 --> 00:56:24,208
Meera...

701
00:56:24,291 --> 00:56:27,708
I need you to tell me why you had
a gun that you never told me about,

702
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:32,458
or why you have some s-secret password
on your filing cabinet.

703
00:56:32,541 --> 00:56:37,250
And I really need to know why you have
a picture of that missing girl, Henry.

704
00:56:43,416 --> 00:56:44,583
I couldn't do it.

705
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:48,375
I thought I could, but I couldn't.

706
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:49,833
Do... Uh...

707
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:52,208
Do... do what, Henry? Do what?

708
00:56:52,291 --> 00:56:54,625
I thought if we tightened our belt
for a while,

709
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:57,333
and, you know,
got a good rate from the bank, um...

710
00:56:58,375 --> 00:56:59,750
What are you talking about?

711
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,916
This house. Meera, look... look at it.

712
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:06,158
Did you ever ask yourself
how we were able to afford it?

713
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:09,375
Well, you... you make a good living.

714
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:12,333
Yeah. I do now.
But that wasn't always the case.

715
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:15,291
And I didn't wanna say anything
'cause I didn't wanna worry you, but...

716
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,625
our insurance had only covered
so much of your treatments.

717
00:57:19,708 --> 00:57:21,541
We were running on fumes for a while.

718
00:57:22,041 --> 00:57:25,333
Okay. Then, um, how did we afford it?

719
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:29,416
I had to find a way
to bring construction costs down.

720
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:32,875
The first step was
taking over as contractor,

721
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:34,625
and the second step was

722
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:39,166
making the IRS think
I pretty much built it alone.

723
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,916
But you had dozens of people building it.

724
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,625
Yeah. And that girl's father
was one of them.

725
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:48,666
And I knew he was a junkie,
but I didn't know he was violent

726
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:52,625
until one day
his daughter drops by the job site,

727
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:54,916
the same day
that photo must have been taken.

728
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,500
And she crashed his truck, like,
jumped the curb or something.

729
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:02,833
And he just starts wailing on her
in front of everybody.

730
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:05,625
I couldn't believe it. And I fired him,
right there on the spot.

731
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:08,833
And he promised me
that I was gonna pay for it,

732
00:58:08,916 --> 00:58:11,250
which I did, literally, for...

733
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:14,208
almost a year.

734
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:18,708
Every month, in that envelope,
which is what I was hoping

735
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:23,208
I'd find at his trailer, 'cause I think
it's the only proof there is.

736
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:26,750
But I don't understand.
If money was the issue in the first place,

737
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:27,833
why would you pay him?

738
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:30,125
I was committing fraud.
I could've gone to prison.

739
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:31,808
- So could have he.
- But he didn't care.

740
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:36,041
This is a guy who, instead of worrying
about his missing daughter,

741
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:40,000
he decided
to break into our house be-because...

742
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,625
Because why?

743
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:45,953
'Cause I stopped paying him.

744
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:47,833

746

to be happy. It's why I built the house.

747
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,750
We were given a chance
to grow old together, and I...

748
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:04,166
I wanted to do that
somewhere that felt like a home.

749
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,375
N-Not... Not a house. A home.

750
00:59:09,833 --> 00:59:11,625
And I... I made some mistakes.

751
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:16,166
But now you know what they are.
I got nothing else to hide.

the code on my filing cabinet,
