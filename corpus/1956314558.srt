332
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:21,981
Basically, he wants to do
an Oklahoma City in Miami,
and it's up to us to stop him.

333
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:26,886
Look, I've trained with you,
but never as your commander.

334
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:29,622
It'll be my privilege
to lead you today.

335
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:32,359

or I overlook something,
let me know.

and that's what you are.

-ALL: Yes, Ma'am.

338

LT. CAROSELLI: Bus CX-17,
if you can hear this,
please respond, Mr. Kee.

339
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:55,582
Mr. Harry Kee, this is
Lieutenant Dominick Caroselli
of the Metro-Dade Police.

340
00:26:55,648 --> 00:27:00,953
I would like to discuss
your demands and resolve
this without any harm to you,

341
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,356
or the passengers.

342
00:27:03,423 --> 00:27:05,057
Maybe he could
have helped you!

343
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:12,832
-Excuse me. Excuse me!
-What?

344
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:14,201
This isn't the right way.

345
00:27:14,267 --> 00:27:17,337
Fernando... Children,
please, no talking.

346
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:21,808
You and Jimmy
are so observant.

347
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:25,512
Why don't you guys look
out the window,
see if you see any police.

348
00:27:25,578 --> 00:27:27,214
Maybe they can
show us the right way.

349
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:30,617
But I already
know the right way.

350
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:34,354
After we pick up Josefina,
we go straight for six lights.

351
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:37,257
Then we make
a left turn. Five blocks.

352
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,792
Then we make
a right turn. Three blocks.

353
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:43,996
Then we make
a right turn into the bus lane
at Jackson Elementary School.

354
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:46,833
At the sign that says
"Buses Only".

355
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:49,969
That's the right way.
This is the wrong way.

356
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:52,739
We have to go back
to Josefina's, so we can
find the right way.

357
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:53,806
WOMAN DRIVER:
Your flashers are on.

358
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:05,285
-What'd she say?
-She said my flashers were on.

359
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:08,655
I forgot to turn them
off after the railroad
crossing, okay?

360
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:13,059
-Forgot?
-Yes. I'm nervous. I'm trying
to do the best I can!

361
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,161
Turn left off the highway,
then pull over and stop.

362
00:28:46,693 --> 00:28:48,495
-What's your name?
-Marta.

363
00:28:49,296 --> 00:28:50,430
You're a liar, Marta.

364
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,106
You've been lying
to me all along, huh, Marta?

365
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:06,713
Listen, the problem
with the IRS
is not the children's fault.

366
00:29:07,714 --> 00:29:09,248
Let her go, please.

367
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:22,829
-Katie...
-Katie's fine.

368
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:26,733
But if I find out you've
been lying to
me again, Katie will be first.

369
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,068
And then the others.

370
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:31,704
And you will be responsible.

371
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:37,677
So we'll just wait right here.
And if anybody shows up...

372
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,049
We'll just do it right here.

373
00:29:54,661 --> 00:30:00,433
Benito, we'll
get to the moon. Okay?

374
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,768
It's gonna be all right.

375
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,783
There you go!
Don't hog the ball.

376
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:21,687
Come on, what are you doing?
Come on, come on. Pass it.
Pass it. Let's go!

377
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,254
-Mr. Caldwell?
-Yeah?

378
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,156
We're Detective Sims
and Grantham, Metro-Dade.

379
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:28,059
-Can we talk to you for
a moment?
-Sure. What's up?

380
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:31,597
Sir, there's an incident
in progress aboard your
wife's school bus.

381
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,898
An incident?
What are you talking about?

382
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,501
Apparently, there's
a hostage situation.

383
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,536
That's all we know.

384
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:39,070
(NERVOUSLY) Well,
is she okay?
Is anybody hurt?

385
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,539
We just got it over the radio.

386
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:42,841
Are you in contact with
the bus? Can I talk to her?

387
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:46,344
Mr. Caldwell, we don't know.
Right now, we just need to
ask you some things.

388
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:49,515
We're bringing the kids'
parents to the Jackson School
to wait this out.

389
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,183
Um, why don't we walk over
there while we talk?

390
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,386
-The principal's already
okayed it.
-Yeah, all right. All right.

391
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:56,287
All right. Would you
take over, please?

392
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,824
-GIRL: Sure.
-Sir, uh, going to work
this morning, uh,

393
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,058
how'd your wife act?

394
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,494
Uh, normal? Was she upset?

395
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:03,829
Well, I wouldn't say
she was upset. I...

396
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,163
What? Maybe depressed?

397
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,632
What the hell kind
of question is this?

398
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,833
Are you saying she's
a suspect in this thing?

399
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,568
No, no, no.
Sir, we don't know.

400
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:12,137
But we have to ask.
Was she depressed?

401
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,641
Yeah, she was depressed, okay?

402
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,610
-Why?
-Why? Why?

403
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:21,379
Because the doctors
have said that the odds of
us ever having

404
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:24,249
a child together are slim.

405
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:27,385
Which we would like to
do, because we've been
married five years,

406
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:30,055
after lousy
first marriages, and we love
each other so much,

407
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,757
you wouldn't believe it.
That's why.

408
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:35,727
Any chance that might make
her want to do, well, you
know, something crazy?

409
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:38,063
You know why
she's driving that bus?

410
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:41,266
Because the other drivers
with more seniority
won't, that's why.

411
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:44,269
These kids have
problems, all right?
But she loves these kids.

412
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,171
And she tells me
about their problems.

413
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,106
She tells me about Benito
and Fernando and Katie.
She loves them.

414
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:51,610
And she would never,
ever do anything to hurt one
of them, or any other child.

415
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:54,379
So you just rule her
out as a suspect.
You rule her out.

416
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:01,553
If that bus is
in trouble, Marta Caldwell
is the best friend

417
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,555
that you or those
kids could possibly have.

418
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:50,301

Mr. Danielson of the IRS. He's
familiar with Mr. Kee's case.

What's Mr. Kee's problem
with the IRS, Mr. Danielson?

Forgive me, but
there are certain sticky

00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,797
Okay?

464
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,032
It's the IRS's position
that Mr. Kee has
underpaid his taxes

465
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:38,436
by sixteen thousand dollars.
Now, he disputes that.
Obviously.

466
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,638
Obviously.

out a payment plan, anything
else that could help,

to the evacuation location.

Couldn't he hire
a lawyer and appeal?

474

My hunch is we're
dealing with a perfectionist.

475
00:35:56,654 --> 00:36:01,292
Someone with huge ego
and pride, who now feels
unjustly persecuted

476
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,063
and he can't cope with that,
so he plans this
suicidal statement.

477
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:09,334
He wants to go out
with a great big bang. It's
so wildly irrational,

478
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,771
and so out of proportion to
the sixteen thousand dollars.

a little story about Marta.

she hid with her family
for five days,

without any food or water,
in a Cuban sugarcane field,

with soldiers patrolling
all around them,

669
00:50:41,835 --> 00:50:43,770

to escape to America.

And when they finally sailed,
her father

saw a patrol boat,
and he armed Marta
with hand grenades.

672
00:50:52,779 --> 00:50:54,581
And she would have used them.

-What do you mean?

to go to Rick's, I swear.

after all these years here,
he quits.

full of customers.

has terminated

I believe he has
harmed his hostages,

would result in further
harm or death.

We searched for explosives
and weapons on the bus
and on Kee's body.

You had no way of knowing.

1154
01:23:01,971 --> 01:23:05,608
None of us did.
We had to assume that
he meant what he said.

1155
01:23:05,675 --> 01:23:07,944
That he would kill
those children and he would
blow up the bus.

1156

Everything, everything they
went through was for nothing.

Whether Kee was mentally ill,
whatever his problem was.

1158

It was not your job
to save him.

Now, you put your life
on the line to do it,

1161

done it any better.

You're a hero, Marta.

1163
01:23:29,766 --> 01:23:30,767
A real hero.

1164
01:23:32,835 --> 01:23:36,505

to ask of you.

to take the children
back to their school.

are waiting for them there.

1167
01:23:42,511 --> 01:23:45,047
Their parents believe
it's vital we show them

1168
01:23:45,114 --> 01:23:47,116
the school bus
and the school are safe.

1169
01:23:47,183 --> 01:23:48,384
And the sooner, the better.

1170
01:23:50,219 --> 01:23:53,155
No. I know these children,
and they won't go
into another bus.

1171
01:23:54,523 --> 01:23:56,125
Maybe they will
if you ride with them.

1172
01:23:57,293 --> 01:23:58,294
(SIGHS)

1173
01:24:01,598 --> 01:24:05,101
MARTA:
Well, we've had some morning,
huh, Fernando?

1174
01:24:05,702 --> 01:24:07,303
Yeah.

1175
01:24:07,369 --> 01:24:09,839
Yeah. A bad man
rode on our bus today.

1176
01:24:09,906 --> 01:24:11,808
A very bad man.

1177
01:24:11,874 --> 01:24:14,811
He scared us all. Even me.

1178
01:24:14,877 --> 01:24:17,680
And you, Jimmy, Celena. Hmm...

1179
01:24:18,715 --> 01:24:21,483
But now he's gone forever.

1180
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:24,520
So you guys will never be hurt
again riding the bus.

1181
01:24:26,188 --> 01:24:30,426
So, now that we've finished
with our field trip,

1182
01:24:30,492 --> 01:24:32,561
how about if we
go to school, hmm?

1183
01:24:32,629 --> 01:24:34,463
But we're gonna need
another bus.

1184
01:24:34,530 --> 01:24:35,932
Don't you think?
Another bus?

1185
01:24:35,998 --> 01:24:37,800
No. I, I can't.
I don't want to go.

1186
01:24:37,867 --> 01:24:40,336
He's gone, Benito.
But just to make sure,

1187
01:24:40,402 --> 01:24:44,106
could put some very important
officers on that bus to check.

1188
01:24:44,173 --> 01:24:45,174
Would that be a great idea?

1189
01:24:49,846 --> 01:24:50,847
Okay.

1190
01:24:54,483 --> 01:24:55,517
Katie, what?

1191
01:24:56,619 --> 01:24:57,654
What, baby?

1192
01:24:58,487 --> 01:25:00,356
Oh, talk to me.

1193
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:02,091
Hmm?

1194
01:25:03,592 --> 01:25:06,162
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

1195
01:25:06,228 --> 01:25:08,030
Listen, I'm gonna sit
next to you in the bus,

1196
01:25:08,097 --> 01:25:11,467
and we'll have all the time
in the world to talk.

1197
01:25:11,533 --> 01:25:12,635
Okay?

1198
01:25:12,702 --> 01:25:13,836
All right, babe?

1199
01:25:20,442 --> 01:25:22,912
It's okay. It's okay.
Come on.

1200
01:25:22,979 --> 01:25:24,681
It's gonna be all right.

1201
01:25:24,747 --> 01:25:25,915
It's gonna be all right.

1202
01:25:27,316 --> 01:25:28,918
I'm coming behind you.

1203
01:25:38,761 --> 01:25:41,430
Okay, guys. No bad man here.

1204
01:25:41,497 --> 01:25:42,799
No bad man.

1205
01:25:42,865 --> 01:25:43,933
It's all clear.

1206
01:25:45,702 --> 01:25:46,736
Good luck.

1207
01:25:47,436 --> 01:25:48,504
Thank you.

1208
01:25:53,375 --> 01:25:55,111
There is so much
I want to say to you.

1209
01:25:59,982 --> 01:26:01,183
Goodbye, Marta.

1210
01:26:05,021 --> 01:26:06,088
Goodbye, Kathy.

1211
01:26:09,692 --> 01:26:10,727
Thank you.

1212
01:26:13,996 --> 01:26:15,064
Thank you.

1213
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:29,378
Okay, kids.

1214
01:26:31,047 --> 01:26:32,081
Okay.

1215
01:27:00,910 --> 01:27:03,780
You gave him every possible
chance, and then some.

1216
01:27:05,181 --> 01:27:06,916
I saw an officer made today.

1217
01:27:11,187 --> 01:27:12,321
Let's go home.

1218
01:27:16,025 --> 01:27:17,526
GRANTHAM: Listen up!
Listen up!

1219
01:27:17,593 --> 01:27:19,996
The parents want privacy
for the kids.
Please respect that.

1220
01:27:20,062 --> 01:27:22,198
Come on, move. Thank you.
Thank you.

1221
01:27:27,636 --> 01:27:29,806
If she never speaks again,
it's okay.

1222
01:27:29,872 --> 01:27:31,240
I just want to hold her.

1223
01:27:38,314 --> 01:27:40,182
Here they are.

1224
01:27:41,117 --> 01:27:43,319
Hey! How you doin', son?

1225
01:27:50,793 --> 01:27:51,894
Hi!

1226
01:28:02,671 --> 01:28:04,340
He was a bad man.
A very bad man.

1227
01:28:04,406 --> 01:28:05,774
Let's go now. You're safe.

1228
01:28:20,857 --> 01:28:22,959
Mommie! Mommie! Mommie!

1229
01:28:23,025 --> 01:28:25,627
Mommy's here.

1230
01:28:25,694 --> 01:28:27,129
Oh, Mommy's here.

1231
01:28:30,299 --> 01:28:31,300
Well...

1232
01:28:39,641 --> 01:28:41,010
I love you.

1233
01:28:53,122 --> 01:28:55,124
(INDISTINCT)

1234
01:28:55,191 --> 01:28:57,726
PARENTS: Thank you.
Thank you, Mrs. Caldwell.
Thank you.

1235
01:29:03,299 --> 01:29:04,466
Oh, my baby.

1236
01:29:09,371 --> 01:29:12,942
I told you it was gonna be
one long day.

1237
01:29:13,009 --> 01:29:14,710
You're okay, huh? Good.

1238
01:29:16,178 --> 01:29:17,279
Oh, Josefina.

1239
01:29:18,915 --> 01:29:21,817
Well, you wanted
another child.

1240
01:29:23,719 --> 01:29:25,387
CHARLOTTE: And now you have
eight more.

1241
01:29:25,922 --> 01:29:26,989
Thanks, Marta.

1242
01:29:30,459 --> 01:29:34,897
Okay, children of bus CX-17,

1243
01:29:34,964 --> 01:29:36,198
straighten your line.

1244
01:29:39,201 --> 01:29:41,003
Where are we going, Senora ?

1245
01:29:42,671 --> 01:29:44,106
To the moon, Benito.

1246
01:29:44,806 --> 01:29:46,208
As always.

1247
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:49,912
To the moon. Let's go.

1248
01:29:53,682 --> 01:29:55,484
PARENTS: Bye!
