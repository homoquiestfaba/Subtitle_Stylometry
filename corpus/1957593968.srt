(MultiCom Jingle)

00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:14,600
("Crown on My Head"
 by Battery Acid)

3
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,933
* I'm running fast
 past a million things

4
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:38,500
* Got my gold, but I have heart

5
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:45,900
* All my hopes came on it later

6
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,733
* And the lies that
 you once told me

7
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:51,633
* I'm not here

8
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:58,333
* Crown on my head

00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:23,267
(dark atmospheric music)

10
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:26,267
- I told you, you
 got magical hands.

11
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:28,067
Give yourself a raise.

12
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:29,900
- Yes, Master Billy.

13
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,533
(video game chimes)

14
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:34,567
(butler clears his throat)

15
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:36,800
- Luncheon is served,
 Master William.

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,733
- Excellent, is Aerosmith here?

17
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,467
- I regret not today, sir.

18
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,167
Something about a
 concert in Europe.

19
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:45,067
- Just as well.

20
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:46,900
I'm in a grunge mood anyway.

21
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,067
- May I have your permission
 to telephone Jam Pearl, sir?

22
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:53,233
- Excellent idea.

23
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:54,900
- Indeed, sir.

24
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,967
- You know what the bad thing
 about being extremely rich is,

25
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:57,833
Jeeves?

26
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,167
- No, sir.

27
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:03,100
- Me neither.
 (roaring motorcycle engine)

28
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,167
Hey, Granny.

29
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:20,300
How far you go today?

30
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,467
- 10 miles.

31
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:22,900
- 10 miles?

32
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,433
- I know.

33
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:26,700
I think I'll leave the leg
 weights at home next time.

34
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,967
(chuckles)

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,667
(cracking thunder)

36
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:37,067
Sounds like rain.

37
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:39,633
- Good, holefield can touch it.

38
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,733
Lobster again?

39
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,900
You've got to be joking me.

40
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,400
- Just shut up and eat.

41
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,700
- I don't need to
 take this from you.

42
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,800
Drop and give me 50, now.

43
00:02:57,733 --> 00:03:00,367
- [Waiter] Yes, master William.

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,500
- Hurry up.

45
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:08,333
(bubbling)

46
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,333
- Hey, moron William!

47
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:17,800
Hey, moron William!

48
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,633
- Leon.

49
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:26,200
- Hey, idiot!

50
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,100
Give me it!

51
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,367
- Give you what?

52
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:31,100
- My term paper,
 moron, it's due today!

53
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,933
- Hold on.

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,900
I'm not gonna do your homework
 for you anymore, Leon.

55
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,133
This is it.

56
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:43,733
- I don't have time
 for this, Bright.

57
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:46,233
I gotta go to the Cooks' house
 to get my science project.

58
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:47,500
Now give me the work.

59
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,333
- Only if you promise
 this is the last time.

60
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,333
- I promise not to come up
 there and rip your ears off

61
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,500
if you give me it now!

62
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,667
- Good enough.

63
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,767
- It better be good!

64
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:00,733
Hey!

65
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:02,233
This isn't typed!

66
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:03,800
- Of course it's not typed.

67
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,200
The typewriter's jammed
and we don't have

68
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,500
enough money to fix it.

69
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,567
Just copy it over in
 your own handwriting.

70
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:11,400
- I don't pay you do I have
 to go redo the work myself.

71
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,133
- Leon, you don't pay me.

72
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:14,800
- Hey, we've got an arrangement.

73
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,833
You do my work,
 I don't kill you.

74
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,333
I would never insult
 our friendship by
 offering you money.

75
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,433
- Insult me!

76
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:21,500
- Okay.

77
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,967
You're a dork.

78
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:24,200
See you around.

79
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,800
(melancholic music)

80
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:44,533
- I wish you were still
here, Mom and Dad.

81
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:47,633
(sighs)

82
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:50,067
Hey, Cecil.

83
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,233
Hey.

84
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:54,067
Hey, baby.

85
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,800
How about somethin' to eat, hm?

86
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,633
Come on.

87
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:08,367
- Good morning, Billy!

88
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:09,367
- Hey, Gran.

89
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,533
Made you some breakfast.

90
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:14,267
- Oh, what would I
 do without my Billy?

91
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:16,167
- Got you some oatmeal.

92
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:19,133
Some juice.

93
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:20,067
What else?

94
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:21,267
- Toast!

95
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:22,100
- Toast!

96
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:23,767
Ouch.

97
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,267
Damnit, I'm such an idiot.

98
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:28,233
- Oh no, don't be silly.

99
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,500
I like my toast, uh, black.

100
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,533
- I don't do anything right.

101
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:37,800
- Yes you do.

102
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,900
You do a lot of things right.

103
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,700
- Yeah sure, name one.

104
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,567
- I can name a million.

105
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:47,733
You're smart, good-looking,
 and you have a big heart.

106
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,967
- You have to say that,
you're my grandmother.

107
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:53,900
- I wouldn't say it if I
 didn't mean it. (chuckles)

108
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,433
You're a wonderful boy who
 takes good care of his granny.

109
00:05:57,433 --> 00:05:59,400
- I just wish things were
 like they used to be.

110
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,600
When you owned the grocery
 store and your heart was okay.

111
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,600
- Well I know, dear, but
I'm just not well enough

112
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,633
to really run the store.

113
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,567
Now Mrs. Lower, she
was very good about it.

114
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:13,067
- Granny, maybe I could
 quit school and get a job.

115
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:14,900
The newspaper
 route isn't enough.

116
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,767
- Sweety, you're too young.

117
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:18,667
You belong in school.

118
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:20,700
- I'm always too something.

119
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,667
Too short, too young.

120
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:23,733
- Stop that!

121
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,433
Where's your pride, dear?

122
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:27,900
You can do anything.

123
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,400
Now repeat the two Cs with me.

124
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,333
- Granny, I don't wanna
recite the two Cs.

125
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,533
I want a new bike, a big house.

126
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:38,800
A personal masseuse
 who calls me Beely.

127
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,633
- Come on!

128
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,100
I have courage!

129
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,200
I am confident!

130
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:47,667
- [Billy] I have courage.
 - [Granny] I have courage!

131
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,933
- [Billy] I am confident.
 - [Granny] I am confident!

132
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:52,200
- [Billy] I have courage.
 - [Granny] I have courage!

133
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,133
- [Billy] I am confident.
 - [Granny] I am confident!

134
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:57,200
Billy, one of these days,

135
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,200
you're gonna grow up and
 you will have everything.

136
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,400
You will be just like
 King Midas. (chuckles)

137
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,933
- And everything I touch will
 turn to gold, I know, I know.

138
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:11,800
- In the meantime, Your
Majesty, go to school.

139
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,167
(upbeat music)

140
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,533
Now, come here.

141
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:17,300
Give your granny
a great big hug.

142
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,167
- All right, Granny.

143
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:21,933
See you after school.

144
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,067
- [Granny] With
 your parents gone,

145
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:08,300
I couldn't keep
 up with the store.

146
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,200
I had to let Mrs.
 Lower buy me out.

147
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,300
- Hey, Hannah.

148
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,067
- Hey, Billy.

149
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:24,833
What's up?

150
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,100
Do you like my new bike?

151
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,533
My dad just bought
 it for me yesterday.

152
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,200
- What's wrong
 with your old one?

153
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,233
- Eh, it was a piece of trash.

154
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:35,633
Well, no offense or anything.

155
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:37,233
- Hey, my bike's not trash!

156
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:40,267
This is a finely-tuned
state-of-the-art riding machine.

157
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:42,767
(clattering and squeaking)

158
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:43,800
Uh.

159
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,900
It's supposed to do that.

160
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,367
You can take it with you.

161
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:48,533
It's portable!

162
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,233
- What a creepy place that is.

163
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,333
- [Billy] Yeah.

164
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,200
It's definitely weird.

165
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,633
(dark atmospheric music)

166
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,100
- I wonder what Mrs.
 Latimer looks like.

167
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,567
- The rich lady?

168
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:08,267
She's seven-foot-tall.

169
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:10,967
Satanic tattoos
 from head to toe.

170
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,767
Razor-sharp fingernails
20-inches-long.

171
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,700
Oh yeah, and blue eyes.

172
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,433
- [Hannah] Wait a minute.

173
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,867
Nobody's ever seen her.

174
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:21,067
How would you know?

175
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:22,200
- Not true.

176
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,067
You know my gym
 teacher, Mr. Devita?

177
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:26,667
Well his friend's cousin's
 cousin knows a guy who sat

178
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,700
next to a man on a
 plane who saw her.

179
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,467
So it's pretty much a fact.

180
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:31,300
- Wow.

181
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:35,633
No wonder she never
comes out of the house.

182
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:37,900
- How do you think she
 gets her groceries?

183
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,767
- I heard she eats
 bugs and stray dogs.

184
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:42,200
- Nasty!

185
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,133
- Do you remember when the
Millers' Great Dane disappeared?

186
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,433
I heard that she
 made him into a dip,

187
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:49,433
then ate him with
 wheat crackers.

188
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:51,367
- Now wait a second.

189
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:52,800
Now if she never
 leaves the house,

190
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,600
how did she get
 her wheat crackers?

191
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,500
- She has these powers,
 like a witch or something.

192
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,767
- Hey, you see that
 hourglass up there?

193
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,400
I heard it once belonged to
 the wicked witch of the west.

194
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,367
- No, that's from
 the Wizard of Oz.

195
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:11,200
There's no such thing.

196
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,600
She's coming!

197
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,500
(cracking thunder)

198
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,667
(school bell rings)
 (background chatter)

199
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,133
- Come on, I'll be late!

200
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:32,000
- Give me a quarter
 and you can go by.

201
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,933
- Get out of my way.

202
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,133
(Billy groans)

203
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,933
- Make it 50 cents.

204
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:38,200
Yeah, right?

205
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,767
Pay the toll right.

206
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:40,900
- What a wuss.

207
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,733
- Man.

208
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:45,933
Here, happy now?

209
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:46,900
- Yeah.

210
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,900
- Somethin' wrong here, Bright?

211
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,200
You guys need something'?

212
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,933
- He took my 50
 cents, for lunch!

213
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:54,667
- Give me!

214
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:55,500
Or else.

215
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:04,300
What would you do without
 me around, Bright?

216
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,700
(rock music)

217
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,600
- Can I have my
 50 cents back now?

218
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,767
- No.

219
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,200
I just saved your butt.

220
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,400
That's the price for life.

221
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,800
- Leon, put your foot down.

222
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,900
Where is your assignment?

223
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,067
(spits)
(thud)

224
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:29,567
(soft giggling)

225
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:31,467
- William, Leon?

226
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:33,867
- [Billy] Who, me?
 - [Leon] Who, me?

227
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:36,200
- It seems to me that
 you both have acquired

228
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,467
the same, exact
 handwriting style.

229
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:41,667
- There is a perfectly good
 and believable explanation

230
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,067
for this, Miss Henderson.

231
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:45,933
- Well, I'd like to hear it.

232
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:46,933
- Now?

233
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:47,933
- Right now.

234
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:51,233
- Tell her, Bright!

235
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:53,333
- Well you see,
 Miss Henderson, um.

236
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,800
Leon broke his hand in a
freak lawnmower accident

237
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,600
and was forced to
dictate his paper to me.

238
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,133
- Broke his hand?

239
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:02,533
There is no cast.

240
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,100
- He's Amish, uh.

241
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,100
He doesn't go for that
 modern medicine stuff.

242
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,567
- All right, I admit.

243
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:12,800
I refuse to sit here and
 lie to you, Miss Henderson.

244
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,533
I did Billy's homework for him.

245
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:16,767
- [Miss Henderson] I see.

246
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,967
- No, Miss Henderson!

247
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:20,800
- Well, I must say
 I'm very disappointed.

248
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,100
But since this is
 your first offense,

249
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,133
I'm gonna be easy
 on you this time.

250
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:27,567
You'll both write a paper
 on what you do this weekend.

251
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,100
Due Monday.

252
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,767
- [Leon] Yes, Miss Henderson.
 - [Billy] Yes, Miss Henderson.

253
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:35,967
(spits)
 - [Billy] Ah!

254
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,233
- You're dead meat.

255
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:39,167
- Me? I told you to
 copy over the paper!

256
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:41,267
- You're not getting out
of this one, bonehead.

257
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:43,633
(rock music)

258
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:46,633
(school bell rings)

259
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:52,667
- Hey, Billy, wait up!

260
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:54,667
I'll ride home with you!

261
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,900
- Where is he?

262
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,733
- Who?

263
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,067
- Bright.

264
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:00,900
I need to give him his
 daily dose of pain.

265
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,867
- You are always on his case.

266
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:04,333
Why don't you just
 leave him alone?

267
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:08,500
- Someone has to toughen
 him up, might as well be me.

268
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,400
(groans)

269
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:14,567
What'd you do that for?

270
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:17,333
- Well, somebody's
 gotta toughen you up.

271
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,067
Might as well be me.

272
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:20,500
Huh?

273
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,433
- No.

274
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,267
No spazzy girl can hurt me.

275
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:24,333
I'm a marine.

276
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,733
(groans)

277
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,200
(background chatter)
 (groans)

278
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,133
- Hey, what happened to you?

279
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:45,733
- Oh, this?

280
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:46,833
I was jumped.

281
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,900
By eight guys, college dudes.

282
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,867
Football jockeys.

283
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:53,067
- Yeah, right.

284
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,967
- Look, I went Van
 Dam on their butts.

285
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:57,533
Hospitalized nine of 'em.

286
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,233
- You just said there was eight.

287
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,200
- Eight football guys.

288
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,400
A couple of weightlifters too.

289
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,367
- You're not that
 brave, no one is.

290
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,067
- Listen, wimp.

291
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:10,200
I'm the bravest guy
 in this neighborhood.

292
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,700
I come from a long
 line of brave men.

293
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,533
My dad was a war hero.

294
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:16,633
My granddad was a war hero.

295
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,600
My grandmom was a war hero.

296
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,500
(chuckles) It's in my blood.

297
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,433
- Oh, yeah?

298
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:22,600
I bet you're not brave enough

299
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,067
to go into the
 witch-lady's house.

300
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:25,600
- Wanna bet?

301
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,567
- I bet you a week's lunches
 that you're not brave enough

302
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,700
to go in there for one minute.

303
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,533
- You're on.

304
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:30,367
(slapping)

305
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:31,700
- Let's go, now.

306
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,233
- Nah, I work alone.

307
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:35,100
- And how are we supposed
 to know that you went in?

308
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,233
Do you think I'm stupid?

309
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:38,533
- There's an hourglass
 in the window.

310
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:40,133
Bring it back.

311
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:41,700
- Yeah, the hourglass.

312
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,233
Bring it back and you win.

313
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:44,900
- Fine, you got your hourglass.

314
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,233
I'll show you wusses.

315
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:47,733
Meet me back here in an hour.

316
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:48,833
- No sweat.

317
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,433
(electric guitar whine)

318
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:54,067
(upbeat music)

319
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,900
(cracking knuckles)

320
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:15,333
- Thought you'd get away, huh?

321
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,900
- I told you to rewrite
 the paper, it's your fault!

322
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,967
(groans)

323
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:23,600
- Figured out your punishment.

324
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,967
I got a little job for ya.
 - [Billy] Ow!

325
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,167
- [Leon] Come on.
 - [Billy] Hey!

326
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:29,567
- [Leon] Come on!

327
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,733
(dark atmospheric music)

328
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:43,067
- Listen, I've had it!

329
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,733
Come on, you and me!

330
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:45,567
Hands up!

331
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:49,933
- You don't wanna do this.

332
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,100
(Billy groans)

333
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,733
Now, are you gonna
 do this favor for me,

334
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:59,667
or do I have to
 bust open an organ?

335
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:04,067
- (coughs) This favor,
is it life-threatening?

336
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:05,667
- Define life-threatening.

337
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:06,867
- Could I die?

338
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:08,400
- Nah.

339
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,733
Not really.

340
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:11,067
Come on, get up.

341
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,500
Get the hourglass.

342
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:20,767
(wondrous atmospheric music)

343
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,567
Go on, get it!

344
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:41,600
(squeaking glass)

345
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:44,767
Hurry up!

346
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:51,600
(faint rumbling)
(twinkling)

347
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,767
(twinkling)
 (cat purrs)

348
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,600
(cat meows)

349
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,667
(door creaks closed)

350
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:31,500
(loud clattering)

351
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:37,167
(door creaks open)

352
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,800
(floorboard creaks)

353
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:46,867
(floorboard creaks)

354
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,300
(cracking thunder)

355
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,700
- What's wrong, Billy Bright?

356
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:18,533
Cat got your tongue?

357
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,567
(cracking thunder)

358
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:28,900
- How'd you know my name?

359
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,667
- I know lots of things.

360
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:34,533
(cracking thunder)

361
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:36,433
You're shaking like a leaf, boy.

362
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:38,067
Are you afraid?

363
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:39,433
- No.

364
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:40,433
I mean, yes.

365
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,133
Look, I'm sorry I
 broke into your house.

366
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:46,133
It's just, I--

367
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:47,800
- Want my hourglass.

368
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:50,400
Well, there it sits.

369
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:06,900
(Billy screams)

370
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:11,067
- Come on, open, let me out!

371
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:15,233
(banging)
 (grunting)

372
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,833
(whooshing)

373
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,567
(zipping and whirring)

374
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,933
- [Old Woman] What's your hurry?

375
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:31,333
- Let me out of here!

376
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,567
I wanna go home!

377
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:34,400
- You'll leave when
 I'm finished with you.

378
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,967
- Please don't kill me.

379
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,433
My granny needs me!

380
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:41,100
- I'm not going to kill
 you, I'm going to help you.

381
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,067
- Help me?

382
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:43,267
How?

383
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,400
- I've been sitting
 in this chair waiting

384
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,967
for a soul with enough
 courage to enter my house.

385
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:52,200
You, Billy Bright,
 are that soul.

386
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,733
- So what are you
 gonna do to me?

387
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,067
- Grant you a wish!

388
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:56,433
- Can't you just let me go?

389
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:57,367
Please.

390
00:19:57,367 --> 00:19:58,933
- Make a wish, boy, make a wish!

391
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:00,067
- I don't know.

392
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:01,267
I just kinda wanna leave.

393
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,400
- What is it you really want?

394
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,000
What is it you desperately need?

395
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,600
Quickly, make a wish!

396
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,433
- Okay.

397
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:10,267
I wish...

398
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,267
I wish I was King Midas.

399
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:16,667
- King Midas.
 (rumbling thunder)

400
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,500
Are you sure?
 - [Billy] That's what I want.

401
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,167
- All right, extend your finger.

402
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,733
Now close your eyes
 and repeat after me.

403
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,600
I, Billy Bright.

404
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,000
- I, Billy Bright.

405
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,667
- Wish to become King Midas.

406
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,233
- Wish to become King Midas.

407
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:38,300
- And will accept the good and
 the bad it will bring to me.

408
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,800
- I accept the good and
the bad it'll bring.

409
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,267
(dark atmospheric chimes)

410
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:47,433
(screams)

411
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:56,867
(screams)

412
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:58,633
- Hey Billy, wait up!

413
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:06,100
(chirping crickets)
 (cracking thunder)

414
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:17,067
- Hey, Cecil.

415
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:19,567
What's the matter?

416
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:21,367
You can't sleep?

417
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:22,733
Me neither.

418
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:24,533
(magical chimes)

419
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,967
Goodnight, Cecil.

420
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,600
(suspenseful music)

421
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,067
(screams)

422
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:52,167
- Billy?

423
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:54,400
Are you all right?

424
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,233
- Cecil.

425
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,900
(magical chimes)

426
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,233
Whoa!

427
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:12,067
(thud)

428
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:13,067
- Billy!

429
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:14,933
What's going on in there?

430
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,733
- Uh, nothing.

431
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:18,333
Just caught myself
 in my zipper again.

432
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,167
(Granny chuckles)

433
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:29,633
(grunts)
(thud)

434
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:35,167
Granny, what if you had
 all the money in the world,

435
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:36,700
and you could get
 anything you wanted,

436
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,800
what would it be?

437
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,833
- Oh, I don't know.

438
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,567
I'd buy you a new bike.

439
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:45,367
- No Granny, what
 would you want?

440
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:48,333
- Billy, what is this all about?

441
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,067
- Well, how about a new heart?

442
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:52,533
- That would be nice.

443
00:22:52,533 --> 00:22:53,367
- Granny.

444
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,633
I'm goin' out and I'm gonna
 get you that new heart.

445
00:22:57,633 --> 00:22:59,200
- That's sweet of you, dear,

446
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,067
but not 'til you wash
those hands, let me see!

447
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:04,167
- Uh, Granny, I gotta go.

448
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:06,400
See you later.

449
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,733
- You made me look bad.

450
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:20,200
Now it's time to pay.

451
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,933
- No Leon, you don't understand!

452
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,167
You don't know what
 happened in there!

453
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:24,733
- Yeah I know that
 I gave you a mission

454
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:26,967
and you didn't follow
your Commander's orders.

455
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:28,333
It's punishment time.

456
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,800
- Shut up and listen!

457
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,600
- Why don't you shut up?

458
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,133
Look, I'm sick of hearing
 your excuses, Bright.

459
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:36,600
If I hear one more word I'm
 gonna bust some kneecaps.

460
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,967
- Mine or yours?

461
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:39,467
- That's it, punk.

462
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:40,833
(groans)

463
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,533
Hey doofus, what'd
 you do that for?

464
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:43,500
- Oops.

465
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Sorry.

466
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,300
Loose breaks.

467
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,467
Are you okay?

468
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,400
- Hannah, you
 wouldn't believe it.

469
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,867
I was in the witch-lady's house!

470
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:51,967
- Excuse me, I'm trying
to give a beating here.

471
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:53,633
- I was trapped, she
 locked the doors.

472
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:56,900
There was this magical
 cat, my heart was pounding.

473
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,467
She offered me the hourglass.

474
00:23:58,467 --> 00:24:00,800
- You didn't take it?

475
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,733
That's it.

476
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:02,933
- She gave me something better.

477
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:05,100
- So, what'd she give you?

478
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:08,333
- This.

479
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,833
- A can?

480
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,567
Big stinkin' deal, I could
 get 12 of those down at the

481
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:15,600
Quick Mart for four--
 (magical tones)

482
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,933
and fifty cents.

483
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:21,700
- How'd you do that?

484
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:25,167
- That's God-like, dude.

485
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,367
- I've got the Midas touch.

486
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,333
- Wait, Billy, what?

487
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,967
How did you, how--

488
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:33,633
- The witch-lady
 granted me a wish.

489
00:24:33,633 --> 00:24:35,667
I told her I wanted
 to be like the king.

490
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:37,067
- Elvis?

491
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:38,067
- No, Midas.

492
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,600
He was some dude
 in ancient times.

493
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,400
He had the power to
turn anything into gold.

494
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,067
- (chuckles) That's my bud!

495
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:50,333
(chuckles)

496
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:51,533
- Bud?

497
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:53,600
- Yeah, we hang out
 together, right?

498
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,700
- If you mean by hang
out, you mean pounding,

499
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,533
well yes.

500
00:24:57,533 --> 00:24:58,733
- Pound you?

501
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:00,733
Those are love
 taps of affection.

502
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,333
- Oh, give me a break, Leon.

503
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,433
You're no friend.

504
00:25:03,433 --> 00:25:06,067
- Hey, when Billy was home sick,

505
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:07,800
who's the one who brought
 his homework assignments

506
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,767
every day for two weeks?

507
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:10,600
- Hannah.

508
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,067
- Oh.

509
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:15,633
Well I thought about doin' it.

510
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:18,200
(upbeat music)

511
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,633
You know, Billy.

512
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:34,100
I can offer you something
 much more than friendship.

513
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,733
Protection, guidance.

514
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,467
- Stupidity.

515
00:25:37,467 --> 00:25:38,767
- Can we lose the dame?

516
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:40,667
- She's my best friend.

517
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:42,333
- Whatever. Come on.

518
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:53,600
Whoa.

519
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
- Why'd we have to
come to your playhouse?

520
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,233
- It's called a fort, thank you.

521
00:26:16,233 --> 00:26:19,500
- Oh yeah, lots of
forts have dolls, right?

522
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,900
Very macho.

523
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,067
- They're called action
figures, thank you.

524
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:26,867
Look Billy, this is
 the way I see it.

525
00:26:26,867 --> 00:26:28,367
You play your cards right
 and you could be the most

526
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:30,367
richest, famous
 person in the world.

527
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:32,067
You could do anything.

528
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,467
Go to the Moon,
 run for president.

529
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,433
Get ringside tickets
 to RumbleMania 12.

530
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:38,967
I'm talkin' power.

531
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:40,567
- Well I was kinda thinking
 maybe if I turned something

532
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:43,100
big into gold, I could get
 a new heart for my grandma.

533
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,367
- Lamebrain, idiot.

534
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:48,400
Buddy, look we're talking
 about a transplant here.

535
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,900
She would have to
 match with someone.

536
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,400
- Match what?

537
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,700
Look, Leon, all Billy wants
 to do is just get a new heart

538
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,700
for his grandmother, all right?

539
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,833
You're not the boss, so
 why don't you just shut up?

540
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:58,700
- Why don't you shut up?

541
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,633
- Good comeback.

542
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:01,400
- Will you guys quit ragging?

543
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,800
- Okay, how about this.

544
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,233
I know a place where
 we can sell the gold,

545
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:05,467
but if we go in with too much,

546
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:07,300
they'd think we robbed
Fort Knox or somethin'.

547
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,633
So as I was saying before
 I was rudely interrupted,

548
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:12,533
that we can bring in a few
 small pieces to get him

549
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:14,833
interested, then we'll hit
 him with the big stuff, okay?

550
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,533
- Yeah, yeah that's a good idea.

551
00:27:17,533 --> 00:27:18,367
- Okay.

552
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:20,133
Here we go.

553
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,167
(chuckles)

554
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:28,867
Do your stuff.

555
00:27:28,867 --> 00:27:31,633
(magical chimes)

556
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:34,867
- [Hannah] Whoa.

557
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:36,933
- Whoa.

558
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,500
Gonna be rich.

559
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,067
- That is awesome.

560
00:27:53,267 --> 00:27:54,567
Hey, Billy.

561
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:55,600
What's wrong?

562
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,533
- I don't know.

563
00:27:57,533 --> 00:27:59,667
- Do you think
 you're gonna be okay?

564
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:00,833
- I think so.

565
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:02,633
Just kinda dizzy.

566
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:05,067
- You want a cold soda or
 something from the Quick Mart?

567
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:06,567
- Yeah.

568
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:08,467
Yeah Leon, that'd be kinda nice.

569
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:09,733
Thanks.

570
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:12,067
- You see, I can be a
 nice guy if I want to.

571
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,767
Um, pick me up some
 jerky while you're there.

572
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:14,767
Extra spicy.

573
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:19,833
What?

574
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:22,200
- How much you think
we'll get for 'em, man?

575
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,067
- Uh, 4,000.

576
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:25,433
Maybe even five.

577
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:26,800
- [Billy] All right.
 - [Leon] Yeah.

578
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,267
- You really think so?

579
00:28:28,267 --> 00:28:30,733
- Yeah, I got it all under
 control, don't worry about it.

580
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:32,567
- Have you ever
 pawned before, though?

581
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:34,800
- No but, but I know, okay?

582
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,700
I'm the man.

583
00:28:44,267 --> 00:28:45,100
Ew, gross.

584
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,633
They're in there.

585
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:49,900
Looks like they're havin' lunch.

586
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,800
Okay, you guys wait here.

587
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,733
I'm goin' in.

588
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,167
- Why can't we go in with you?

589
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,933
- Yeah, why can't we?

590
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,200
- 'Cause I'm the one
 with the fake ID?

591
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,900
- Where did you score an ID?

592
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,800
- My brother's
 older friend John J.

593
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,367
- You don't look like John J.

594
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:08,400
- What?

595
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,267
- Firstly, he's good-looking.

596
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:12,933
Secondly, he's like 15
 years older than you.

597
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:15,833
- What, you guys
 got a better idea?

598
00:29:18,067 --> 00:29:19,333
Didn't think so.

599
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,867
(upbeat guitar music)

600
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:30,900
(bell rings)

601
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,067
- What can I do for you?

602
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:33,700
- I have some items.

603
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,533
- To sell?

604
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,733
- Uh yeah, to sell.

605
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:40,333
- How old are you, kid?

606
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:41,400
- 18!

607
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,200
I'm 18-years-old.

608
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,367
'Cause if you think I'm
lyin', I'm not, I'm 18.

609
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,200
- Year of birth.

610
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,767
- Year of birth?

611
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:51,667
Uh, 19, are you
 ready for the rest?

612
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:53,600
63.

613
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:00,267
- Sounds about right.

614
00:30:00,267 --> 00:30:02,533
Still gonna need to
 see some ID, though.

615
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:04,000
- ID, me?

616
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,433
- Yeah, ID, yeah.

617
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:08,767
- Look, bless your heart.

618
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:12,700
The missus is gonna get
a kick out of this one.

619
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,133
(man laughs)

620
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:21,800
(woman laughs)

621
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,967
- Do we look like the
 supidest people on the planet?

622
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:29,100
- You must think we're a couple
of morons, this isn't you.

623
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,467
You have blue eyes!

624
00:30:31,467 --> 00:30:33,367
- Color contact lenses.

625
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,467
- Oh yeah.

626
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,367
Yeah, okay.

627
00:30:38,467 --> 00:30:40,033
So what do you got?

628
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,033
There's more where
 that came from.

629
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,033
- Cora.

630
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:51,300
Cora!

631
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,133
- What?

632
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,900
Wow.

633
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,467
- Leon's showing him the stuff.

634
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:02,867
Hey Billy, are you okay?

635
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:04,500
- I'm okay.

636
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,467
I just feel kinda weirded out.

637
00:31:07,467 --> 00:31:09,233
- What's wrong?

638
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:11,067
You look kinda yellow.

639
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:17,500
- So!

640
00:31:19,433 --> 00:31:21,100
You got these from
 a friend of yours,

641
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,567
is that what you're tellin' us?

642
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:24,100
- Uh, yeah.

643
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,133
A friend that owed
 me a lot of money.

644
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:28,600
So, how much are you guys
gonna give me for all of these?

645
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,367
- I think we should give
 him the super-special deal.

646
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:34,300
- Not the super-special deal!

647
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,067
How will we ever
 stay in business?

648
00:31:37,067 --> 00:31:40,333
- This is not about staying
 in business, my dear brother.

649
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:43,567
This is about
 pleasing the customer.

650
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:45,067
- Oh, right.

651
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:47,467
My beautiful and ever-so
intelligent sister.

652
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:48,467
- Come on, guys.

653
00:31:48,467 --> 00:31:49,967
Give me the super-special deal.

654
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:51,467
Give me it! Come on, please?

655
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:52,967
- Well, all right.

656
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,900
No, can't do it, it's
too good a deal for you!

657
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,067
- Come on, please?

658
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:00,767
- Okay.

659
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:04,667
I'll give you 200
 for the whole bundle.

660
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:05,933
- I'll take it.

661
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:11,067
- Here you go!

662
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:12,900
- Whoa, thanks.

663
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,233
(woman and man laugh)

664
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,533
(Leon chuckles)

665
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:19,800
Come on.
 (upbeat music)

666
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,533
- Let's follow 'em!

667
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:23,767
Maybe they got more gold.

668
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:27,700
- Those stupid kids
are gonna make us rich!

669
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,367
Hey!

670
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:30,200
Get away!

671
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:38,567
There we go!

672
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:40,667
Wow, I'm tired!

673
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,400
I gotta stop.

674
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,667
- Could you park the
 car any further away?

675
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:47,200
- I'm sorry, all right?

676
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,200
Come on, let's go.

677
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Come on.

678
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,233
Ow, oh I'm okay, I'm all right.

679
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:53,067
I'm okay, I'm okay.

680
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:53,867
All right.

681
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,433
You know, I gotta
 park this thing--

682
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,533
- Shut up and drive!

683
00:32:58,533 --> 00:32:59,733
- Sorry.

684
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:02,400
(car screeches)

685
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,633
You see 'em?

686
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:08,633
- No!

687
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:10,467
Can't this junk go any faster?

688
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:14,633
- I'm crankin' this baby into
 high gear so you just hold on!

689
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:21,333
(bike bell rings)

690
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,067
(hissing smoke)

691
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:29,667
There they are.

692
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,800
I'm gonna hit 'em off.

693
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,800
- Hey, let me see.
 (man choking)

694
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,300
Hey, that sign says
 this is one way!

695
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,167
- I'm only driving one way.

696
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:44,400
- Oh.

697
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,633
Yeah!

698
00:33:45,633 --> 00:33:46,833
(car horn honks)

699
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:49,567
(car screeching)

700
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:53,700
(car horn honks)
(car screeching)

701
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,800
Idiot.

702
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,733
(cars screeching)

703
00:33:57,733 --> 00:34:01,233
(clattering and smashing)

704
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:04,633
- What ya doin', cheatin' us?

705
00:34:04,633 --> 00:34:06,567
- No, dweebet.

706
00:34:06,567 --> 00:34:08,600
I have a secret hiding place.

707
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,667
Here's your guys's share.

708
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:11,133
50 bucks each.

709
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,400
- 50 bucks?

710
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,633
How am I gonna get my
 grandma well on that?

711
00:34:14,633 --> 00:34:16,067
- Like this.

712
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:17,333
- Leon, I don't feel--

713
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,867
(magical chimes)

714
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:21,300
- Billy?

715
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,967
Billy, are you okay?

716
00:34:24,133 --> 00:34:25,733
Leon, something's
 wrong with him.

717
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:27,067
- Let me see.

718
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:28,267
- Well do you know
 what you're doing?

719
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:31,367
- Relax, would ya, my
 father's a dentist.

720
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:33,700
(slap)
 - [Billy] Ow!

721
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,267
- He's fine.

722
00:34:35,267 --> 00:34:37,567
- I'm okay, I just
 need to go home.

723
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:38,867
- Excellent idea.

724
00:34:38,867 --> 00:34:41,200
Headquarters is on the
shutdown for the night.

725
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,600
I say we rendezvous at
 uh, oh-ten-hundred hours.

726
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,200
That's 10 in the morning
for you civilians.

727
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,300
- Hannah, you go down first.

728
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,600
I'll be down in a second.

729
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,700
- Okay.

730
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,467
(peaceful music)

731
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:07,400
- Hey, Leon?

732
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,367
- Yeah.

733
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:11,233
- Do me a favor, will ya?

734
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:12,933
If anything happens to me,

735
00:35:12,933 --> 00:35:15,267
I want you to take
 care of my grandma.

736
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:17,533
- You want me to
 kill your grandma?

737
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:20,100
- No, not that kind
 of take care of.

738
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,600
The real one.

739
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,833
- Oh.

740
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:23,667
Yeah, sure.

741
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,100
Anything you say.

742
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:35,433
- Look, Billy, I
 don't trust that guy.

743
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,367
I mean, the whole Rambo thing.

744
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:40,200
The helmet, the
 oh-ten-hundred hours.

745
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,267
Come on, Billy,
 it's just not right.

746
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:43,600
- It's okay.

747
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,067
What's he gonna do?

748
00:35:45,067 --> 00:35:48,167
Like you said, I'm the
 one with the magic finger.

749
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:49,600
I'm tired.

750
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,567
- All right.

751
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:51,767
I'll ride you home.

752
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:52,600
Hop on.

753
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:58,200
Billy, if you touched
 me with that finger,

754
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,300
do you think I'd turn to gold?

755
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,067
- I don't know.

756
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:03,633
- Careful where you
 point that thing.

757
00:36:03,633 --> 00:36:06,200
I don't think my parents
want a 24-caret kid.

758
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,767
(upbeat music)

759
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:13,667
How do you do this light?

760
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:16,333
It was supposed
 to do that, right?

761
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:17,800
- You know, it's
 gettin' hot in here.

762
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,100
Do you think you could
 open up this sardine can?

763
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,367
- You don't have to
 call it a sardine can.

764
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:22,200
It's not a sardine
 can, it's 196--

765
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,867
- Would you shut up
 and push the button?

766
00:36:23,867 --> 00:36:25,500
- I pushed it, I pushed
it, it's working.

767
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,333
- God!

768
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:30,300
- There, there, see?

769
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,700
It's one of them kids who's
 got the stash of gold.

770
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,800
I just know it, it's one of 'em.

771
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,533
- Well we just ride to
 it and we'll be rich.

772
00:36:36,533 --> 00:36:40,700
Filthy stinkin' rich!
(man laughs maniacally)

773
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:45,167
- What are we laughin' at?

774
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:46,567
- I don't remember.

775
00:36:46,567 --> 00:36:47,633
Let's go!

776
00:36:47,633 --> 00:36:50,633
(car engine starts)

777
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:57,167
(muffled radio chatter)

778
00:36:57,167 --> 00:37:00,233
(melancholic music)

779
00:37:02,967 --> 00:37:03,800
- Billy!

780
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:09,367
Hey, Billy, what's goin' on?

781
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:12,833
- You'll be fine.

782
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:15,400
You just need to get some rest.

783
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:18,367
- What's wrong?

784
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:19,600
What's goin' on? What
happened to my grandma?

785
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,067
- She's okay.

786
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:23,967
Her heart was beating just
 a little bit too fast.

787
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:25,500
- Well, are you gonna take her?

788
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,433
- No.

789
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:28,100
No, she's stabilizing now,

790
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:32,167
but she'll be needing a
pacemaker pretty soon.

791
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,067
- Granny.

792
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,467
- [Granny] Billy boy.
- [Billy] Are you okay?

793
00:37:37,467 --> 00:37:38,800
- Yes, I'm fine.

794
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,967
- Promise me you won't leave
 me like Mom and Dad did.

795
00:37:42,967 --> 00:37:45,100
I don't wanna be all alone.

796
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,567
- Oh, Billy, I...

797
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:47,400
- Promise!

798
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,667
- All right, dear.

799
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:50,500
I promise.

800
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:56,867
- Is there anything
 I can get you?

801
00:37:56,867 --> 00:38:00,133
- How about a cold
 glass of water?

802
00:38:00,133 --> 00:38:01,333
- Cold water?

803
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:03,567
I can handle that, hold on.

804
00:38:04,633 --> 00:38:07,367
(magical chimes)

805
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,433
(sighs)

806
00:38:15,433 --> 00:38:16,267
Done.

807
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:23,333
(running water)

808
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:27,500
Ice tray was empty, so I
 hope this is cold enough.

809
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,067
(screams)

810
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:30,467
(smashing glass)

811
00:38:30,467 --> 00:38:31,667
(thud)

812
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:34,567
(cracking thunder)

813
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,700
(suspenseful music)

814
00:38:45,233 --> 00:38:47,633
(loud bang)

815
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:50,300
(loud bang)

816
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,633
(loud bang)

817
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:58,633
(door creaks open)
 (cracking thunder)

818
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:06,367
(door locks shut)

819
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,633
(cracking thunder)

820
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,800
- You're the one they call Leon?

821
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,933
You want something from me?

822
00:39:32,933 --> 00:39:34,733
- No, I mean, I mean yeah.

823
00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:35,833
- Speak!

824
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:36,667
- I, I--

825
00:39:37,733 --> 00:39:39,600
- Just as I thought.

826
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,167
No longer such a tough
 young lad, are you?

827
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:43,367
- Look, I'm not afraid of you.

828
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:44,700
- You should be!

829
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:49,067
- Me feet, they're stuck!

830
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:51,700
- So, you wish you
 could move your feet?

831
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,833
- I'm not gonna fall for that.

832
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:55,533
I wish to be like King Midas.

833
00:39:55,533 --> 00:39:58,633
- Your wish must be for
 something you really need.

834
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:00,633
Your heart is greedy.

835
00:40:00,633 --> 00:40:02,600
You want only to be rich.

836
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,000
You're not thinking
 of anyone else, no!

837
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,733
I don't grant wishes like that.

838
00:40:07,733 --> 00:40:09,000
- Look, then I wanna wish for--

839
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,867
- I'll tell you what
 you want, and need.

840
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,267
Yes.

841
00:40:13,267 --> 00:40:17,333
I know exactly what a
boy like you could use.

842
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:18,833
- A new CD player?

843
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,900
(magical chimes)
(whooshing)

844
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,067
(screams)
 (cracking thunder)

845
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:44,067
(door creaks open)

846
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,667
- Billy?

847
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:48,533
(suspenseful music)

848
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:49,367
Billy!

849
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:50,633
Billy, please wake up!

850
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:51,467
Wake up!

851
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:54,900
Billy, Billy what did you do?

852
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,900
Your grandmother's gold.

853
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,300
- I know, I know.

854
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,867
I can't believe it.

855
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,233
It was an accident, I mean...

856
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:06,967
What am I supposed to do?

857
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,467
- Look, Billy.

858
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:11,067
You've gotta go back to the
 witch-lady's house, all right?

859
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:13,667
You've gotta make her
 undo what she did to you.

860
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:15,333
- What if she won't?

861
00:41:17,067 --> 00:41:18,600
- Look, Billy.

862
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,667
You've gotta at
 least try, all right?

863
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:22,667
Your grandmother's gold.

864
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:26,800
- Yeah, you're right.

865
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,300
I gotta be strong.

866
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,267
I'm confident, I have courage.

867
00:41:32,267 --> 00:41:34,967
I'm confident and
 I have courage.

868
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:36,333
- Billy.

869
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:37,733
What are you doing?

870
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:40,167
- I'm reciting the two Cs.

871
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,667
I'm confident, I have courage.

872
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:46,267
Okay, I'm ready.

873
00:41:46,267 --> 00:41:48,533
Witch-lady can't scare me.

874
00:41:48,533 --> 00:41:51,633
I'm confident and
 I have courage.

875
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:52,700
Hannah.

876
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,367
You'll come with me, right?

877
00:41:55,367 --> 00:41:56,367
Oh, come on!

878
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,533
- All right, Billy.

879
00:41:58,533 --> 00:41:59,367
Let's go.

880
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,300
Come on, let's go!

881
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,800
- Hannah, wait up!

882
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:15,067
Witch-lady doesn't scare me.

883
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,067
- Red bird to sparrow,
 red bird to sparrow.

884
00:42:23,067 --> 00:42:24,867
The geese fly west
 in the summer.

885
00:42:24,867 --> 00:42:26,433
Leave the nest and
 join the party.

886
00:42:26,433 --> 00:42:30,600
(radio static)
 (man gasps)

887
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:33,767
Sparrow!

888
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:37,400
- Okay-doke, go for sparrow.

889
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,867
- This is red bird.

890
00:42:38,867 --> 00:42:41,200
The geese are flying,
 leave nest and join party.

891
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,467
(radio static)

892
00:42:42,467 --> 00:42:44,867
- Geese are flying and
 I gotta go to a party?

893
00:42:44,867 --> 00:42:48,100
- The geese, the kids,
 you join the party!

894
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,967
(radio static)

895
00:42:50,967 --> 00:42:53,067
- The kids are flyin' and
 I gotta go to a party?

896
00:42:53,067 --> 00:42:57,300
- The kids are leaving the
 house, it's time to roll!

897
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,967
- Kids, house, role.

898
00:43:00,467 --> 00:43:01,800
I don't know what
 you're talkin' about.

899
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,633
- Get your can
 outta that dumb car!

900
00:43:04,633 --> 00:43:06,400
- Right, right, uh!

901
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,800
Ten-four!

902
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,200
The sparrow has left the nest!

903
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,667
Right, okay, I'm coming.

904
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:12,533
My pizza!

905
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:15,533
(suspenseful music)

906
00:43:16,867 --> 00:43:18,800
Okay, you can relax now.

907
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,633
- Shh!

908
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:20,767
- All right, shh.

909
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:22,233
You can relax now,

910
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:24,200
because I've got extensive
 training in this area.

911
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,167
I was a boy scout, you know.
 (clanging)

912
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:27,367
- Quiet!

913
00:43:27,367 --> 00:43:28,900
- Here's what we're gonna do.

914
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:33,067
I'll use my cat-like nimbleness
to shimmy up that tree.

915
00:43:33,067 --> 00:43:34,067
(clanging)

916
00:43:34,067 --> 00:43:35,300
Sorry.

917
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,467
I'll wallow my way up to
the end of that branch,

918
00:43:37,467 --> 00:43:40,067
dropping down behind
 the fence, you see?

919
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:42,733
Thus proceeding to maneuver
 a-break in from there.

920
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:43,867
You ready?

921
00:43:43,867 --> 00:43:44,700
On three.

922
00:43:47,533 --> 00:43:48,900
Three!

923
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,067
(whines)

924
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:56,200
(chuckles nervously)

925
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,567
(gate squeaks open)

926
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:01,433
(groans)
(thud)

927
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:03,067
- The gate is open!

928
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:17,333
(man grunting)

929
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:18,300
- Upstairs.

930
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,467
Upstairs apartment.

931
00:44:20,467 --> 00:44:22,133
- I knew that.

932
00:44:22,133 --> 00:44:23,867
I was just checkin' out
my new crowbar here.

933
00:44:23,867 --> 00:44:27,933
Makin' sure it all looked
 real good, workin' perfect.

934
00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:28,767
- Bingo.

935
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,267
- Bingo?

936
00:44:31,267 --> 00:44:33,133
It's not Thursday night.

937
00:44:33,133 --> 00:44:34,333
- That window!

938
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:36,067
It's open!
 - [Man] Ow.

939
00:44:37,733 --> 00:44:38,567
- Hey!

940
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:40,200
I have an idea!

941
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,300
Why don't we go in
 through that window?

942
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,633
You know what I could do?

943
00:44:43,633 --> 00:44:46,067
I could attach something
above the window...

944
00:44:46,067 --> 00:44:47,900
Nah, that's not gonna work.

945
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,167
Okay, I could shimmy
 my way up that tree,

946
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:51,533
and come with over with a--

947
00:44:51,533 --> 00:44:53,133
- Hey, could you
 help me with this?

948
00:44:53,133 --> 00:44:54,367
(clanging)

949
00:44:54,367 --> 00:44:55,533
(thud)
 (man groans)

950
00:44:55,533 --> 00:44:57,167
- That didn't hurt, I'm okay.

951
00:44:57,167 --> 00:44:58,167
I'm okay.

952
00:44:58,167 --> 00:44:59,900
Oh, that didn't hurt.

953
00:45:01,067 --> 00:45:04,367
This, on the other
hand, is pretty painful.

954
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,767
(clanging)

955
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,800
There she is.

956
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,100
- Well?

957
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,200
Get up there!

958
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,700
(man chuckles)

959
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,200
- I can't go up there. You
 know I'm scared of heights.

960
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,067
Why me?

961
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:21,100
Okay, I'm goin'.

962
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:29,933
- Go on!

963
00:45:32,067 --> 00:45:33,500
- I hate ladders.

964
00:45:41,133 --> 00:45:44,067
(door creaks open)

965
00:45:53,067 --> 00:45:55,867
(creaking ladder)

966
00:45:58,233 --> 00:45:59,567
(door knock)

967
00:45:59,567 --> 00:46:03,267
(door creaks open)

968
00:46:03,267 --> 00:46:04,100
- Whoa!

969
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:06,567
Oh, yes.

970
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:09,533
(creaking and clanging ladder)

971
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:10,367
Gold!

972
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,800
Willy!

973
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,333
- That's the mother lode.

974
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:18,767
- Willy!

975
00:46:18,767 --> 00:46:22,467
We melt this sucker down,
 and we're home-free.

976
00:46:22,467 --> 00:46:23,633
Rich!

977
00:46:23,633 --> 00:46:24,500
- Help me.

978
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,333
Help me!

979
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,867
- Hurry up and get in
 here, ya tub of lard!

980
00:46:28,867 --> 00:46:29,700
Oh my god.

981
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,733
(Willy screaming)

982
00:46:37,733 --> 00:46:38,633
Hey, Willy!

983
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:39,900
Are you all right?

984
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,067
- I'm okay.

985
00:46:41,067 --> 00:46:42,500
I'm all right.

986
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,233
(suspenseful music)

987
00:46:44,233 --> 00:46:45,533
- [Billy] Come on.

988
00:46:45,533 --> 00:46:46,700
- [Hannah] I just
don't wanna end up like

989
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,600
the Millers' Great Dane.

990
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,067
- Listen, Hannah,
 this was your idea.

991
00:46:51,067 --> 00:46:52,467
- [Hannah] I know.

992
00:46:52,467 --> 00:46:53,700
What do I know?

993
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,167
Look, Billy.

994
00:46:57,167 --> 00:46:59,600
Maybe the doctors can do
 something for your granny.

995
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,867
You know, modern
 medicine's come a long way.

996
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:05,633
- Hi-diddly-o, friends.

997
00:47:05,633 --> 00:47:06,567
- [Billy] Leon?
- [Hannah] Leon?

998
00:47:06,567 --> 00:47:08,233
- Come on out of that chill!

999
00:47:08,233 --> 00:47:09,533
May I take your jackets?

1000
00:47:09,533 --> 00:47:12,700
Pour you some lemonade,
read you a story?

1001
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,800
(suspenseful music)

1002
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,633
Come on!

1003
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,133
Don't be afraid.

1004
00:47:27,467 --> 00:47:28,733
(chuckles)

1005
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:30,400
Madame Latimer isn't
 here right now but,

1006
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,600
you guys can make yourselves
 comfy as I finish my chores.

1007
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,333
- Leon, what has
gotten into you?

1008
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,733
(rumbling)

1009
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,300
- Don't you love it when she
 does that appearing thing?

1010
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,633
Isn't she swell?

1011
00:47:44,633 --> 00:47:47,567
- Manners has gotten
into him, Billy Bright.

1012
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:50,633
He was a mean-spirited bully.

1013
00:47:50,633 --> 00:47:51,633
Not anymore!

1014
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,200
Why have you returned?

1015
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,067
- I...

1016
00:47:57,067 --> 00:47:59,333
- Why have you returned?

1017
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:01,200
- I need another wish!

1018
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,900
I want you to fix my grandma!

1019
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,900
- Impossible.

1020
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,833
You only get one wish.

1021
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:07,933
- I don't wanna be
 Kind Midas anymore!

1022
00:48:07,933 --> 00:48:09,133
Cancel the spell!

1023
00:48:09,133 --> 00:48:10,300
- I can't.

1024
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,600
- Listen, lady,
 what's wrong with you?

1025
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,067
Because of you, Billy's
grandmother is a statue,

1026
00:48:15,067 --> 00:48:16,833
and Leon over here is a dorkus.

1027
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,533
Not to mention you've
 never left your house

1028
00:48:18,533 --> 00:48:19,933
and you eat stray dogs.

1029
00:48:19,933 --> 00:48:22,433
(magical tones)

1030
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:23,833
- Hey, what'd you do to Hannah?

1031
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:25,433
- Silence!

1032
00:48:25,433 --> 00:48:29,233
I'm going to say this once,
 and I'm going to say it loud!

1033
00:48:29,233 --> 00:48:30,800
Leave!

1034
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,067
(rumbling)

1035
00:48:33,933 --> 00:48:35,067
- it was great working with you.

1036
00:48:35,067 --> 00:48:37,300
Can I use you on my resume?

1037
00:48:38,733 --> 00:48:40,767
- My grandma said one day
 I'd be like King Midas.

1038
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:43,267
Things would be better and
 they'd work out for me.

1039
00:48:43,267 --> 00:48:44,667
But they're not!

1040
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:47,467
- I told you to be
 careful what you wish for.

1041
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:50,067
You must take the
 bitter with the sweet.

1042
00:48:50,067 --> 00:48:51,367
- But she's sick!

1043
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:52,700
All I wanna do is make her well,

1044
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,267
that's what my wish really was.

1045
00:48:54,267 --> 00:48:55,867
So we could be happy again.

1046
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:58,133
But I just went and
 messed everything up!

1047
00:48:58,133 --> 00:49:01,233
- There is nothing
 more I can do for you.

1048
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:02,100
Now go!

1049
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,867
- No, I'm not gonna go.

1050
00:49:03,867 --> 00:49:06,500
I'm a Bright and I have
 courage and I have confidence.

1051
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,367
I'm gonna stand here
 with my head held high

1052
00:49:08,367 --> 00:49:10,167
until you change me back!

1053
00:49:10,167 --> 00:49:11,067
- I can't.

1054
00:49:12,067 --> 00:49:13,100
- Why not?

1055
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,400
- Only you can do that.

1056
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,200
(loud rumbling and screeching)

1057
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,200
- Save it for Halloween.

1058
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:29,867
- Are you chaps okay?

1059
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:31,233
- Just a little freaked out.

1060
00:49:31,233 --> 00:49:32,867
- She wouldn't cancel my wish.

1061
00:49:32,867 --> 00:49:34,333
Now what am I supposed to do?

1062
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:36,333
- You know what I do
 when I'm feeling blue?

1063
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:38,133
I go to the library.

1064
00:49:38,133 --> 00:49:40,067
- Hello, Leon.

1065
00:49:40,067 --> 00:49:43,200
Where's the old Leon, the
 one that we know and we hate?

1066
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,367
- Hold on, wait a second!

1067
00:49:45,367 --> 00:49:46,633
Leon's got a point!

1068
00:49:46,633 --> 00:49:47,833
We just have to go to
 the library and learn

1069
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:49,533
about the old King Midas.

1070
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:52,533
(suspenseful music)

1071
00:49:56,467 --> 00:49:58,067
- I hope it's open.

1072
00:49:58,067 --> 00:50:00,067
- Well if it's not, we're
 gonna have to break in.

1073
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:01,967
- That would be morally
and legally wrong.

1074
00:50:01,967 --> 00:50:03,300
- Come on, Leon.

1075
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:13,400
- Open, nine to five.

1076
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,667
- Dang it, it's closed!

1077
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:17,167
- Now what?

1078
00:50:17,167 --> 00:50:18,600
- Guess we're gonna have to
 come back when it's open.

1079
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,900
- When, Monday morning?

1080
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,067
- [Leon] Mm-hm.

1081
00:50:21,067 --> 00:50:23,500
- We gotta break in!

1082
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,733
Hannah, you can leave.

1083
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:26,867
I don't wanna get you
 in any more trouble.

1084
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:29,533
It's my granny and I did it
 and now I have to undo it.

1085
00:50:29,533 --> 00:50:31,567
By any means necessary.

1086
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:32,967
Leon will help me.

1087
00:50:32,967 --> 00:50:34,500
- I'm staying.

1088
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,733
- Good! (chuckles)

1089
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:37,200
So you don't need
 me here, right?

1090
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,367
- Come on, let's
 check out the back.

1091
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:40,200
- Great.

1092
00:50:41,267 --> 00:50:42,100
- Hey!

1093
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,333
Hey, this one's loose!

1094
00:50:51,267 --> 00:50:52,967
Midas, where would it be?

1095
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:54,233
- In the mythology section.

1096
00:50:54,233 --> 00:50:55,567
Come on, go, go!

1097
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,833
- Come on, Leon!

1098
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:01,633
Come on!

1099
00:51:05,067 --> 00:51:07,733
(guard snoring)

1100
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:12,133
- Where abouts is--

1101
00:51:12,133 --> 00:51:13,533
- [Billy] Shh!
- [Hannah] Shh!

1102
00:51:13,533 --> 00:51:14,367
Quiet!

1103
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,067
Now, I think it's up this way.

1104
00:51:17,067 --> 00:51:20,067
Be quiet, don't
 make too much noise.

1105
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:24,733
Shh.

1106
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,400
(door slams shut)
 (Billy gasps)

1107
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,233
God, shh.

1108
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,267
Okay, got geography.

1109
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:34,967
History.

1110
00:51:35,833 --> 00:51:36,667
Politics.

1111
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,333
Biology.

1112
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,333
- Cooking?

1113
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,433
- Hey, there it is, mythology!

1114
00:51:47,433 --> 00:51:48,833
- How are we gonna get up there?

1115
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:50,233
There's no way up.

1116
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:52,200
- Hannah, step on my shoulders.

1117
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,067
- Okay.

1118
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:58,400
All right.
- [Leon] I'll help you.

1119
00:52:12,933 --> 00:52:14,467
- Okay, I think this is it.

1120
00:52:14,467 --> 00:52:16,267
Here you go.

1121
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:17,333
(thud)

1122
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:18,167
- What?

1123
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,900
Must have been dreaming.

1124
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:26,733
- Okay.

1125
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:30,633
Okay, here's something.

1126
00:52:30,633 --> 00:52:32,967
King Midas, King of Phrygia.

1127
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,733
Okay.

1128
00:52:39,067 --> 00:52:41,367
King Midas, golden touch.

1129
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:42,867
Okay, here it is.

1130
00:52:42,867 --> 00:52:45,767
Finally Pan, the god of the
 fields took pity on Midas

1131
00:52:45,767 --> 00:52:50,167
King of Phrygia who found
 only bitterness in his gift.

1132
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,467
(sizzling)
 - [Leon] Ow.

1133
00:52:52,467 --> 00:52:53,300
- Come on.

1134
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,067
He commanded Midas to
 traverse his kingdom and again

1135
00:52:58,067 --> 00:53:00,967
touch all things he
 had turned into gold.

1136
00:53:00,967 --> 00:53:03,800
Completing this task broke
 the spell and restored

1137
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,167
those things to the
 way they once were.

1138
00:53:06,167 --> 00:53:07,133
- Yeah.

1139
00:53:07,133 --> 00:53:08,500
- [Billy] Yeah.
- [Leon] Yeah!

1140
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,267
Oh, that was close.
 - [Billy] Oh, that was close.

1141
00:53:10,267 --> 00:53:12,200
- You guys, come
 on, there's more.

1142
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,867
But Pan said the task
 must be performed

1143
00:53:14,867 --> 00:53:18,200
before the noon hour
 which follows the alchemy

1144
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,333
or those things shall
 forever remain gold.

1145
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:21,500
- Oh.

1146
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,967
- Man.

1147
00:53:22,967 --> 00:53:26,367
- King Midas prayed to
 Dionysus, some Greek guy.

1148
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:31,467
The god told him to bathe
 in the river, Pactoralus.

1149
00:53:31,467 --> 00:53:35,133
He did and the curse
 left him, immediately.

1150
00:53:35,133 --> 00:53:37,233
- The river who?

1151
00:53:37,233 --> 00:53:38,467
- Billy.

1152
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:39,867
You're going metallic.

1153
00:53:39,867 --> 00:53:42,500
- I thought you looked
 a little yellow.

1154
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,067
- It's just my finger.

1155
00:53:44,067 --> 00:53:46,900
- Billy, what color
 are your eyes?

1156
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,167
- Blue.

1157
00:53:48,167 --> 00:53:49,733
- Not anymore.

1158
00:53:49,733 --> 00:53:53,900
(Hannah screams)
 (suspenseful music)

1159
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,633
- If this is gonna
 work, let's do it.

1160
00:53:59,633 --> 00:54:01,800
(zapping)

1161
00:54:03,567 --> 00:54:06,467
(door creaks open)

1162
00:54:07,867 --> 00:54:08,700
- Oh-oh.

1163
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:09,900
- What are you doin'?

1164
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,967
You kids know you
 don't belong in here!

1165
00:54:12,967 --> 00:54:13,800
- I surrender.

1166
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,067
- Come on!

1167
00:54:15,067 --> 00:54:17,633
Billy, remember
 to touch the book!

1168
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:24,467
- You kids know better than
 to hang around in here.

1169
00:54:25,633 --> 00:54:27,133
Hey, what's that?

1170
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:28,733
- It's just a book.

1171
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:31,367
- That's gold.

1172
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:32,933
That is solid gold.

1173
00:54:35,233 --> 00:54:36,733
Hey uh...

1174
00:54:36,733 --> 00:54:38,200
Hey kid, get out of here, huh?

1175
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,500
It's all right, I
 won't tell anybody.

1176
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,100
- Please sir, I need that book.

1177
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,933
- Just get lost.

1178
00:54:44,933 --> 00:54:46,900
- You don't understand!

1179
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,100
I have to have it!

1180
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,833
- What the...

1181
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:53,067
(zapping)

1182
00:54:59,867 --> 00:55:00,733
- Ah, ah!

1183
00:55:02,867 --> 00:55:05,067
- I touched it and
 it didn't turn back.

1184
00:55:05,067 --> 00:55:07,333
- But that's 'cause you
 have to touch everything.

1185
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:08,733
Once you touch that last thing,

1186
00:55:08,733 --> 00:55:11,067
then everything will
 turn back to normal.

1187
00:55:11,067 --> 00:55:13,933
- That means that we gotta
 go back to the pawn shop.

1188
00:55:13,933 --> 00:55:15,833
Everything I touched
 is back there!

1189
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:18,467
- Look, whatever we do,
we've gotta do it soon.

1190
00:55:18,467 --> 00:55:21,433
The task must be performed
 before the noon hour,

1191
00:55:21,433 --> 00:55:23,067
which follows the alchemy,

1192
00:55:23,067 --> 00:55:25,267
or all those things
 shall remain gold.

1193
00:55:25,267 --> 00:55:26,967
- By noon tomorrow?

1194
00:55:26,967 --> 00:55:29,733
- Is that noon,
 Eastern Standard Time?

1195
00:55:29,733 --> 00:55:31,633
(thud)
 Ow!

1196
00:55:31,633 --> 00:55:33,200
Do not strike me.

1197
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,733
I'm opposed to all
 forms of violence.

1198
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:38,467
- What happened to him?

1199
00:55:38,467 --> 00:55:40,967
(guitar riff)

1200
00:55:44,933 --> 00:55:46,167
I don't feel good.

1201
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:47,400
- Well, you know what?

1202
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,300
You will feel much, much better

1203
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,067
when you get some
 food into your body.

1204
00:55:52,067 --> 00:55:53,067
- Here they are.

1205
00:55:53,067 --> 00:55:54,933
Three death burgers, extra mayo.

1206
00:55:54,933 --> 00:55:56,133
- I'm not hungry.

1207
00:55:56,133 --> 00:55:57,633
My granny needs me!

1208
00:55:57,633 --> 00:55:58,800
- Come on, Billy.

1209
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,367
You've got to eat.

1210
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:05,233
(magical tones)

1211
00:56:05,233 --> 00:56:06,400
(Billy groans)

1212
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,333
(Leon laughs)
 (suspenseful music)

1213
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:08,833
- I think I broke a tooth.

1214
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:09,933
- Let me see.

1215
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:14,300
- Billy, your teeth are gold.

1216
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,767
- You sort of look
 like a metal mouth.

1217
00:56:16,767 --> 00:56:18,400
- This can't be happening!

1218
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,233
- You totally look
 like Run-D.M.C.

1219
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,700
That was a compliment?

1220
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,500
Hey, there's the guy
 from the pawn shop.

1221
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,767
Look, he has a gold
 statue in his trunk.

1222
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:35,067
- Oh, no!

1223
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:37,233
They're stealing my granny!

1224
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,967
(jazzy music)
(car screeches)

1225
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:53,100
- Hurry up, let's go!

1226
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,800
- Ow, my head!

1227
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,433
Okay, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1228
00:56:59,433 --> 00:57:01,267
Let's get it out, come on.

1229
00:57:01,267 --> 00:57:02,767
Come on, can you pull, please?

1230
00:57:02,767 --> 00:57:05,267
(Cora groans)

1231
00:57:06,633 --> 00:57:07,967
Can you close the door?

1232
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:09,767
Not yet, not yet!

1233
00:57:09,767 --> 00:57:12,367
All right, come on, come on.

1234
00:57:12,367 --> 00:57:14,133
We're gonna set her down
here, put her head down.

1235
00:57:14,133 --> 00:57:16,967
I'm gonna unlock the
 door, you hold her.

1236
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:17,800
- Hurry up.

1237
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,300
- Hold her for a second.

1238
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,233
- You know, if Ma could see
 if now she'd be so proud.

1239
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:22,733
- Why?

1240
00:57:22,733 --> 00:57:24,233
'Cause we're like, workin'
 together for the first time

1241
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:25,467
without fightin'?

1242
00:57:25,467 --> 00:57:28,167
- No, 'cause we finally
stole something good!

1243
00:57:28,167 --> 00:57:29,367
(Willy chuckles)

1244
00:57:29,367 --> 00:57:30,633
- You know I start
 to get real emotional

1245
00:57:30,633 --> 00:57:31,800
when you say nice
 things like that.

1246
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,667
- Oh shut up, fathead,
 and pick her up!

1247
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:34,500
Go!

1248
00:57:35,533 --> 00:57:37,333
Come on.
 - [Willy] Come on!

1249
00:57:37,333 --> 00:57:38,733
I got it. You got it?
 - [Cora] Yeah.

1250
00:57:38,733 --> 00:57:39,833
- I got it, come on.

1251
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:41,267
Come on, come on.

1252
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,700
(suspenseful music)

1253
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,200
- Guys, I think we
 should call the cops.

1254
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,467
- And say what?

1255
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,967
"Hi, I'm looking
 for a stolen granny.

1256
00:57:56,967 --> 00:58:00,100
"She's 5'7, and oh
 yeah, solid gold."

1257
00:58:02,067 --> 00:58:03,533
- Look, you guys,
 we got to the cops

1258
00:58:03,533 --> 00:58:05,733
and Billy can't go back
and retouch everything.

1259
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:08,433
- But, I think we should
 notify the proper authorities.

1260
00:58:08,433 --> 00:58:09,633
- No!

1261
00:58:09,633 --> 00:58:11,900
We gotta get granny
 back ourselves.

1262
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:16,533
And if anyone can't handle
 this, they should leave now.

1263
00:58:16,533 --> 00:58:19,433
- All for one, and one for all.

1264
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:21,567
(upbeat music)

1265
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:25,233
- Sometimes you just
gotta say what the hey.

1266
00:58:27,067 --> 00:58:28,233
- It's locked.

1267
00:58:28,233 --> 00:58:30,367
- [Willy] I got it,
 give me the hook.

1268
00:58:30,367 --> 00:58:32,433
- [Cora] Here's the hook.

1269
00:58:35,867 --> 00:58:36,700
- There!

1270
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:41,333
Maybe you could get
 up through the roof.

1271
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:43,067
- Okay, pull her up.

1272
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,133
- Watch out.

1273
00:58:49,133 --> 00:58:50,400
(clattering)

1274
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,767
- Hold, hold, hold,
hold on, you hear that?

1275
00:58:52,767 --> 00:58:55,767
- You mean, that loud crashing
 noise coming from the alley

1276
00:58:55,767 --> 00:58:58,167
that sounded like a trunk
 falling off a garbage can?

1277
00:58:58,167 --> 00:58:59,333
- Yeah.

1278
00:58:59,333 --> 00:59:01,100
What do you suppose it was?

1279
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,633
- [Cora] No idea.
 - [Willy] Right.

1280
00:59:02,633 --> 00:59:05,900
- Come on, let's
get her in here.

1281
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,267
- Billy, be care--

1282
00:59:07,267 --> 00:59:10,067
(magical chimes)

1283
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,433
(zapping)

1284
00:59:23,433 --> 00:59:24,667
- Beautiful.

1285
00:59:24,667 --> 00:59:26,367
He remembered to
 touch the ladder.

1286
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:27,900
- Yes!

1287
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:28,933
- Come on, get her up!

1288
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:29,867
Come on, pull her up!

1289
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:31,733
That'a girl, come on!

1290
00:59:31,733 --> 00:59:32,800
Get her in!

1291
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,600
(suspenseful music)

1292
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,633
- Would you help me?

1293
00:59:37,633 --> 00:59:38,967
- Oh, right.

1294
00:59:38,967 --> 00:59:41,467
(Cora groans)

1295
00:59:43,867 --> 00:59:45,933
- What the heck was that?

1296
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,467
- I don't know.

1297
00:59:50,467 --> 00:59:52,867
But whatever it was,
 I'm gonna squash it.

1298
00:59:52,867 --> 00:59:55,367
(Cora groans)

1299
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,500
(door squeaks open)

1300
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:05,367
Well!

1301
01:00:05,367 --> 01:00:07,167
I don't see anybody out there.

1302
01:00:07,167 --> 01:00:09,867
Let's turn this
 baby on, put her in,

1303
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:11,833
melt her down, liquefy.

1304
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:14,200
- Yeah, turn it on.
 (clunking)

1305
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,933
What are you gonna do with
 your half of the money?

1306
01:00:16,933 --> 01:00:18,900
I'm gonna buy lots of taffy.

1307
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,200
- I don't know.

1308
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,000
I'll probably place a
portion of the principal

1309
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,567
in derivatives and then
I'll take the bulk of it

1310
01:00:24,567 --> 01:00:27,200
and place it into 10%
 convertible bonds.

1311
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,933
You know, they're trading in
 tremendous discount-to-face

1312
01:00:28,933 --> 01:00:30,367
value these days.

1313
01:00:34,633 --> 01:00:36,333
- Yeah, me too.

1314
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:40,233
You know, I meant after that,
 probably, I'll buy some taffy.

1315
01:00:40,233 --> 01:00:44,400
Okay, uh, turn the flames down
 while we put in the statue.

1316
01:00:48,933 --> 01:00:50,167
Okay, you ready?
- [Willy] Yep!

1317
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:51,233
- Okay, come on.

1318
01:00:51,233 --> 01:00:52,267
Ready?
 - [Willy] Yep.

1319
01:00:52,267 --> 01:00:54,167
- [Cora] One.
 - [Willy] One.

1320
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:55,800
- [Cora] Two.
 - [Willy] Two.

1321
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,467
- [Cora] Three.
- [Willy] Three.

1322
01:00:57,467 --> 01:00:59,567
- You go downstairs and
 get the rest of the gold.

1323
01:00:59,567 --> 01:01:02,400
- [Willy] Right!
 - [Cora] (groans) Not now!

1324
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,400
(suspenseful music)

1325
01:01:09,267 --> 01:01:10,300
- Come on, come on.

1326
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,267
Shh.

1327
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:12,100
Come on!

1328
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,833
(Willy chuckles)

1329
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:19,533
- She's be liquid
 gold in seconds!

1330
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:23,933
Oh! Downstairs now!
 - [Cora] Yes!

1331
01:01:23,933 --> 01:01:24,833
- [Willy] Right!
- [Cora] Now!

1332
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:26,967
- Okay, all right.

1333
01:01:26,967 --> 01:01:30,300
(door opens and closes)

1334
01:01:32,933 --> 01:01:35,933
(suspenseful music)

1335
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:37,833
- Oh, yeah.

1336
01:01:40,233 --> 01:01:43,433
- All right guys, we
 gotta make this look good.

1337
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:44,267
- What?

1338
01:01:52,467 --> 01:01:53,300
- Freeze!

1339
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,800
Reach for the clouds!

1340
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,733
- Sky, it's reach for the sky.

1341
01:01:56,733 --> 01:01:58,067
- Right, sky!

1342
01:01:58,067 --> 01:01:59,467
Do it!
 - [Leon] Say please.

1343
01:01:59,467 --> 01:02:01,367
There's no need to be rude.

1344
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:02,900
- Leon, this is stick-up!

1345
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,167
- Wait.

1346
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:05,567
Why are your guns
 under your shirts?

1347
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:08,167
- Uh, because um, Hannah?

1348
01:02:08,167 --> 01:02:09,733
- Because uh, Leon?

1349
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:11,833
- Because we're
 lying. (chuckles)

1350
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,867
- That's right, because we're...

1351
01:02:13,867 --> 01:02:15,067
Leon!

1352
01:02:15,067 --> 01:02:17,200
- You kids come to rob us, huh?

1353
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,267
- No.

1354
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:20,167
I just want my grandmother back!

1355
01:02:20,167 --> 01:02:21,867
And all the other
 stuff we sold you.

1356
01:02:21,867 --> 01:02:23,900
- I paid for that
 stuff fair and square.

1357
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,800
- We'll give you
your money back.

1358
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,233
You don't understand, that's
 my grandmother you've got!

1359
01:02:28,233 --> 01:02:30,500
- Your grandmother? What
are you talkin' about?

1360
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,467
- The statue is my granny!

1361
01:02:32,467 --> 01:02:34,500
- Oh yeah, and this can?

1362
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,367
Is this your uncle Herb?
(suspenseful music)

1363
01:02:36,367 --> 01:02:37,200
- No.

1364
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,700
Now give her back!

1365
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:42,300
- One step closer, and I'll
 melt her like a popsicle.

1366
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,133
- We got 'em now! (laughs)

1367
01:02:45,133 --> 01:02:47,200
JJ, I'm surprised at you.

1368
01:02:48,067 --> 01:02:49,367
You're 18.

1369
01:02:49,367 --> 01:02:51,067
You should know
 better than to try

1370
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,100
to rob somebody
 with a finger point!

1371
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,567
- That can hurt me, sir.

1372
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:57,400
- Get away from him!
 (Willy grunts)

1373
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,500
- Tie 'em up!

1374
01:02:59,767 --> 01:03:01,867
(clattering)
 (Willy groans and whines)

1375
01:03:01,867 --> 01:03:03,367
- Oh right, okay.

1376
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:05,167
Everybody back-to-back,
 come on, all three of you.

1377
01:03:05,167 --> 01:03:08,367
Come on.
 (children groaning)

1378
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:09,933
- Where is the other stuff?

1379
01:03:09,933 --> 01:03:11,600
- Here, it's in this bag.

1380
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,567
- [Cora] Throw it in!

1381
01:03:12,567 --> 01:03:14,333
(clanging)

1382
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:15,833
- Yeah.

1383
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,533
(chuckles)

1384
01:03:17,533 --> 01:03:20,900
- Billy, you've
 gotta do something.

1385
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,867
- Leon, have you
 got anything sharp?

1386
01:03:22,867 --> 01:03:24,600
- Let me see.

1387
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,867
- All right, we'll melt it down

1388
01:03:25,867 --> 01:03:27,700
and put it in these buckets.

1389
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,633
- And you know what we'll do?

1390
01:03:28,633 --> 01:03:30,067
We'll get rid of these three,

1391
01:03:30,067 --> 01:03:32,667
sell the gold to the
 refinery, we'll melt her down,

1392
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:35,200
well um, we'll turn
 it into gold bars

1393
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,067
and then Cora, we'll be rich.

1394
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:39,067
Then I can buy that
 new pocket video game

1395
01:03:39,067 --> 01:03:40,233
that I like so much!

1396
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,467
You know, the one that like,

1397
01:03:41,467 --> 01:03:42,367
that video with the
 little bunnies on it?

1398
01:03:42,367 --> 01:03:43,867
And then we'll--
(sizzling)

1399
01:03:43,867 --> 01:03:46,367
(gasps) Think of somethin'
 else cool to do with it.

1400
01:03:46,367 --> 01:03:49,467
- [Cora] All right,
 I'll heat her up.

1401
01:03:50,933 --> 01:03:51,800
(whooshing)

1402
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,067
(thud)
 (Willy groans)

1403
01:03:53,067 --> 01:03:55,467
(clattering)

1404
01:04:00,467 --> 01:04:03,233
(suspenseful music)

1405
01:04:03,233 --> 01:04:04,667
- You stop there!

1406
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,767
(clanging)

1407
01:04:11,533 --> 01:04:13,200
(thud)

1408
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,833
(chuckles) Yeah.
 - [Billy] Look out!

1409
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:19,067
(valve squeaking)
 (grunting)

1410
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,067
My granny.

1411
01:04:22,167 --> 01:04:23,067
She's gone!

1412
01:04:24,067 --> 01:04:25,500
- Look, Billy uh.

1413
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,767
Maybe we could just take her
 back to your place, all right?

1414
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:30,333
We just gotta get out of here
 before they wake up, okay?

1415
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:31,933
We'll figure out what to do.

1416
01:04:31,933 --> 01:04:32,867
Come on.

1417
01:04:32,867 --> 01:04:35,867
(suspenseful music)

1418
01:04:43,233 --> 01:04:44,933
(children grunting)

1419
01:04:44,933 --> 01:04:46,133
- All right, let's go, come on!

1420
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:48,067
- No, Billy, you
 gotta touch the ID.

1421
01:04:48,067 --> 01:04:49,933
Remember, you gotta touch
 everything, all right?

1422
01:04:49,933 --> 01:04:52,200
- That's right.
(zapping)

1423
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,067
- All right, let's go!

1424
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,733
Got it?

1425
01:04:56,733 --> 01:04:57,700
Come on!
 - [Leon] We got it.

1426
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:58,567
- Let's go!

1427
01:04:58,567 --> 01:05:00,533
Hurry, hurry, let's go!

1428
01:05:05,467 --> 01:05:07,267
- That stuff weighs a ton!

1429
01:05:07,267 --> 01:05:08,500
How are we gonna carry this

1430
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,967
all the way to my
 grandma's place?

1431
01:05:09,967 --> 01:05:10,800
- No idea.

1432
01:05:12,733 --> 01:05:14,133
What's she doing?

1433
01:05:15,933 --> 01:05:18,500
- Why walk when you can drive?

1434
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,267
- Because, we don't
 have a license.

1435
01:05:20,267 --> 01:05:22,067
- Well, we don't.

1436
01:05:22,067 --> 01:05:23,633
But you do, John J.

1437
01:05:24,733 --> 01:05:27,733
(suspenseful music)

1438
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,933
(twanging)

1439
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:40,100
(thud)
 (Leon groans)

1440
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:46,567
- I got 'em!

1441
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:48,500
Should be one of these.

1442
01:05:51,167 --> 01:05:54,233
(car engine revving)

1443
01:05:55,433 --> 01:05:56,600
- Oh, no.

1444
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,733
Oh, no.

1445
01:05:57,733 --> 01:05:59,367
My Impala!

1446
01:05:59,367 --> 01:06:01,867
No, don't hit anything, don't!

1447
01:06:01,867 --> 01:06:05,333
Just 20 more payments and
 that baby was gonna be mine!

1448
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:06,667
- You just hit something.

1449
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:08,700
- Come on, let's get 'em!

1450
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:09,633
- Right.

1451
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:10,533
- We really should leave a note.

1452
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:11,667
- Go, come on!

1453
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:12,500
Just go!

1454
01:06:15,067 --> 01:06:16,733
(Willy yelps)

1455
01:06:16,733 --> 01:06:19,800
- You kids get out of
 my precious Impala,

1456
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:20,633
right now!

1457
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,767
Oh, no!

1458
01:06:23,767 --> 01:06:25,367
You're gonna have
 to kill me first!

1459
01:06:25,367 --> 01:06:27,433
(groans)

1460
01:06:28,367 --> 01:06:29,200
Cowards!

1461
01:06:30,733 --> 01:06:32,100
Cowards!

1462
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,167
(grunts)

1463
01:06:35,067 --> 01:06:36,067
Cowards!

1464
01:06:36,067 --> 01:06:37,200
- [Cora] Willy!
- [Willy] What?

1465
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,067
- [Cora] Their bikes!
 - [Willy] Right!

1466
01:06:42,367 --> 01:06:43,200
(clattering)

1467
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,067
Ow, ow!

1468
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:48,133
What did you do that for?

1469
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:50,900
- Leon should be back soon.

1470
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:53,467
(Leon panting)

1471
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,267
Hey, Billy.

1472
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:01,300
Are you okay?

1473
01:07:03,867 --> 01:07:05,767
- Oh man, that's attractive.

1474
01:07:05,767 --> 01:07:07,833
I look like a freak!

1475
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:09,067
- No.

1476
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:11,833
Billy, you don't look
 like a freak, okay?

1477
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:12,667
- Yeah?

1478
01:07:14,067 --> 01:07:16,333
- Well, maybe just a little.

1479
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:19,667
But in a good way.

1480
01:07:24,867 --> 01:07:25,833
- I got it.

1481
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,300
That should be it, right?

1482
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,833
(suspenseful music)

1483
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:31,833
(car engine starts)

1484
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,800
(children grunting)

1485
01:07:55,233 --> 01:07:56,400
Uh-oh.
- [Hannah] What?

1486
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,867
- Come on, we'll
find those kids.

1487
01:07:57,867 --> 01:07:59,067
- There they are!

1488
01:07:59,067 --> 01:08:02,800
- Hurry, and try and
not to spill any granny.

1489
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,200
- Come on, stupid, pedal faster!

1490
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,333
- I'm pedaling as fast as I can!

1491
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:07,933
Oh no, don't brake!

1492
01:08:09,267 --> 01:08:12,200
(clattering)

1493
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,067
- Be careful!

1494
01:08:13,067 --> 01:08:14,300
Don't drop Granny!

1495
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,700
- Okay, I got it.

1496
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:18,233
- Me first!

1497
01:08:20,067 --> 01:08:22,167
Oh, I'm breathin' too hard.

1498
01:08:22,167 --> 01:08:23,467
- Come on.

1499
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:24,300
Take it.

1500
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:34,833
- It's open.
(Cora chuckles)

1501
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:36,067
- Okay, Billy,
 touch the buckets.

1502
01:08:36,067 --> 01:08:37,233
Bring her back now.

1503
01:08:37,233 --> 01:08:38,500
- No, wait!

1504
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,633
You grandmother might
 end up in two pieces.

1505
01:08:40,633 --> 01:08:42,167
We've gotta put it
 all in the same spot.

1506
01:08:42,167 --> 01:08:43,567
- All right, come on, come on.

1507
01:08:43,567 --> 01:08:44,400
Pick it up.

1508
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:47,400
(suspenseful music)

1509
01:08:51,733 --> 01:08:53,233
Put her in.

1510
01:08:53,233 --> 01:08:55,900
- I swear I'm gonna pass out.

1511
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,167
- [Cora] Shut up
 and get up there!

1512
01:08:57,167 --> 01:08:59,400
- I can't, I can't
 go any further!

1513
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,200
- Get out of the way!

1514
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,200
- What's the matter with you?

1515
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,600
Climbing over me.

1516
01:09:06,633 --> 01:09:10,500
(Cora and Willy panting)

1517
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:13,133
All right, no more
 messin' around.

1518
01:09:13,133 --> 01:09:14,633
- What are you doing?

1519
01:09:14,633 --> 01:09:16,233
- I am getting in there, by
 whatever means I have to.

1520
01:09:16,233 --> 01:09:18,633
So you just step back
 and watch yourself.

1521
01:09:18,633 --> 01:09:20,933
(door knock)

1522
01:09:20,933 --> 01:09:22,067
Room service!

1523
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:24,700
- How dumb are you?

1524
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:27,767
They're never gonna
 fall for that!

1525
01:09:27,767 --> 01:09:29,933
- Oh no, Billy, the drain!

1526
01:09:34,433 --> 01:09:36,633
- This should work.

1527
01:09:36,633 --> 01:09:37,967
(door knock)

1528
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:39,800
Candygram! (chuckles)

1529
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,800
(Cora laughs derisively)

1530
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,067
- [Cora] Willy.
- [Willy] What?

1531
01:09:42,067 --> 01:09:43,333
- Let me see your
 head for a second.

1532
01:09:43,333 --> 01:09:44,700
- There's something
 wrong with my head?

1533
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,067
- [Cora] No, it's perfect!
 - [Willy] What?

1534
01:09:46,067 --> 01:09:47,367
(thud)
 Ow!

1535
01:09:47,367 --> 01:09:48,800
(thud)
 Ow!

1536
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,367
(thud)
 Ow!

1537
01:09:50,367 --> 01:09:54,400
(muffled screaming and thuds)

1538
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,567
(thuds)
 (groaning)

1539
01:10:02,033 --> 01:10:03,533
- Billy, touch it!

1540
01:10:05,133 --> 01:10:07,067
- [Billy] What's wrong?

1541
01:10:10,567 --> 01:10:12,633
- Out of my way, sister.

1542
01:10:12,633 --> 01:10:14,333
All right, you little twerp.

1543
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:17,833
Now give us the gold, which
 you stole, which we stole!

1544
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:21,700
- No.
 (suspenseful music)

1545
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,067
- What the--

1546
01:10:23,067 --> 01:10:24,133
(Billy groans)

1547
01:10:24,133 --> 01:10:25,533
- Billy!

1548
01:10:25,533 --> 01:10:27,400
- Now you're gonna
 tell me how three kids

1549
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,000
come up with all of this gold.

1550
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,667
- Yeah!
(Hannah screams)

1551
01:10:32,667 --> 01:10:34,867
- [Hannah] Let me go!
 - [Willy] You shut up.

1552
01:10:34,867 --> 01:10:37,067
And you kid, come clean,
 or your little girlfriend's

1553
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:39,900
gonna go flyin' right
 through that window.

1554
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,000
- Okay, okay.

1555
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,567
I'll tell you.

1556
01:10:44,567 --> 01:10:47,133
I got a pretty cool trick
 I can do with this finger.

1557
01:10:47,133 --> 01:10:49,367
- Are you double-jointed too?

1558
01:10:49,367 --> 01:10:50,200
- Cooler.

1559
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,833
Everything I touch
 turns to gold.

1560
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,167
- So, you have a special power

1561
01:10:56,167 --> 01:10:59,100
to turn things into gold, huh?

1562
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,433
Well you're gonna
 tell me the truth,

1563
01:11:00,433 --> 01:11:03,700
or this stuff is
 goin' down the drain.

1564
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:04,533
- No!

1565
01:11:05,767 --> 01:11:06,933
(sighs)

1566
01:11:06,933 --> 01:11:09,300
Okay, you don't believe me?

1567
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:10,700
Touch my finger.

1568
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:15,067
- (giggles) What, do
 you think I'm stupid?

1569
01:11:15,067 --> 01:11:17,500
- Well you'll be rich.

1570
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,300
- What are you, scared?

1571
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:20,867
Touch his finger.
 - [Willy] No!

1572
01:11:20,867 --> 01:11:22,200
Don't touch his finger, Cora.

1573
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,800
It's probably that
 farting trick.

1574
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,967
Remember when we were kids?

1575
01:11:25,967 --> 01:11:26,967
- Okay, kid.

1576
01:11:28,167 --> 01:11:29,933
I'll play your little game.

1577
01:11:29,933 --> 01:11:31,900
(magical tones)

1578
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:34,067
(zapping)

1579
01:11:40,267 --> 01:11:42,567
- I think I'm gonna faint.

1580
01:11:42,567 --> 01:11:44,200
- Can I help you?

1581
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,067
Oh, be careful.

1582
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:47,233
(loud rumbling)

1583
01:11:47,233 --> 01:11:48,300
- Wait.

1584
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,867
Wait a second, you guys.

1585
01:11:49,867 --> 01:11:51,367
The book was wrong.

1586
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:53,700
You touched the gold and
then nothing happened.

1587
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:55,667
- [Billy] I forgot something!

1588
01:11:55,667 --> 01:11:57,567
- Get this guy off me, please.

1589
01:11:57,567 --> 01:11:59,100
- All right.

1590
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:00,067
- Go.

1591
01:12:00,067 --> 01:12:01,433
- One, two, three.

1592
01:12:06,533 --> 01:12:08,700
(zapping)

1593
01:12:10,567 --> 01:12:12,267
All right, let's tie him up.

1594
01:12:12,267 --> 01:12:13,900
Hurry.
 - [Leon] Okay.

1595
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:16,067
(zapping)

1596
01:12:22,133 --> 01:12:24,067
- [Hannah] All right,
he's not going anywhere.

1597
01:12:24,067 --> 01:12:26,133
- Okay, Billy, finish it.

1598
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,333
(loud rumbling)
(dark atmospheric music)

1599
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:38,900
(screams)

1600
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,067
(zapping)

1601
01:12:48,167 --> 01:12:49,333
- Hello there?

1602
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,900
Are you friend of Billy's?

1603
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,133
- But you, how?

1604
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:55,933
- Granny!

1605
01:12:57,533 --> 01:12:58,367
Are you okay?

1606
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:00,300
- Yes, dear, I'm fine.

1607
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:03,767
But your friend there
 seems a little pale.

1608
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,267
- Hey, Cecil.

1609
01:13:10,267 --> 01:13:11,400
Hey.

1610
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,533
Bet you're glad to be home, huh?

1611
01:13:14,533 --> 01:13:15,800
(Willy yelps)

1612
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,800
- You don't understand,
I don't even like jail!

1613
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,433
I don't like camp,
 I don't like jail.

1614
01:13:20,433 --> 01:13:22,667
I don't wanna go away, I
don't wanna go to jail!

1615
01:13:22,667 --> 01:13:24,933
I don't wanna, you lousy kids!

1616
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:27,067
- What's with the
 gold eyes, kid?

1617
01:13:27,067 --> 01:13:28,967
- Uh, it's for Halloween.

1618
01:13:28,967 --> 01:13:31,067
He's going as King Midas.

1619
01:13:32,233 --> 01:13:34,133
- Halloween is six months away.

1620
01:13:34,133 --> 01:13:36,733
- He's getting an early start.

1621
01:13:36,733 --> 01:13:39,900
- Guys, my whole
 body's turning stiff.

1622
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:43,367
I'm turning to gold!

1623
01:13:43,367 --> 01:13:45,267
- [Hannah] We have
 to find a river.

1624
01:13:45,267 --> 01:13:46,767
I mean, it's close to 12 now.

1625
01:13:46,767 --> 01:13:48,700
- [Leon] But there's none
 around here, anywhere.

1626
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,167
- [Officer] There
 used to be one.

1627
01:13:50,167 --> 01:13:51,300
- Where?

1628
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,767
- Used to be Wayland River.

1629
01:13:52,767 --> 01:13:55,067
That is until the sanitation
 department took it over.

1630
01:13:55,067 --> 01:13:57,067
- The sewage canal up north?

1631
01:13:57,067 --> 01:13:59,267
- Yeah that's it, I used to
 fish there when I was a kid.

1632
01:13:59,267 --> 01:14:00,300
Not anymore.

1633
01:14:01,467 --> 01:14:02,900
- Guys, we've gotta go.

1634
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:05,900
(suspenseful music)

1635
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:12,467
- I know this place.

1636
01:14:12,467 --> 01:14:14,067
- How do we get in?

1637
01:14:14,067 --> 01:14:17,633
- You guys just have to
 have confidence and courage.

1638
01:14:17,633 --> 01:14:19,700
- [Hannah And Leon]
 Confidence, courage.

1639
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:22,067
Confidence, courage.

1640
01:14:22,067 --> 01:14:23,667
Confidence, courage.

1641
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,300
- Look you guys, I
 don't know about this.

1642
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:30,067
I mean, this is where Joey
 Beck drowned last summer.

1643
01:14:30,067 --> 01:14:32,367
He was a really good swimmer.

1644
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:35,200
- They used to call it Dead
Man's Creek it was so dangerous.

1645
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,633
- You guys aren't helping.

1646
01:14:36,633 --> 01:14:39,567
- Look, Billy, maybe we
 could just do something else.

1647
01:14:39,567 --> 01:14:41,067
Like, dunk you in a pool.

1648
01:14:41,067 --> 01:14:44,267
- Or, go through the car
 wash with your windows open.

1649
01:14:44,267 --> 01:14:46,200
- Thanks, but I gotta do this.

1650
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,567
It's the only way!

1651
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:49,267
(Leon sighs)

1652
01:14:49,267 --> 01:14:50,867
- You'll drown in there.

1653
01:14:50,867 --> 01:14:52,533
- He's right, Billy.

1654
01:14:54,067 --> 01:14:56,433
- Please, let's just do this!

1655
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,100
- Okay, look, I'm
 gonna go first.

1656
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:07,667
(grunts)

1657
01:15:14,133 --> 01:15:15,133
Ouch!

1658
01:15:15,133 --> 01:15:15,967
- Leon!

1659
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:18,767
- [Leon] Help me.
 - [Hannah] Don't move!

1660
01:15:18,767 --> 01:15:19,933
Almost got it.

1661
01:15:23,433 --> 01:15:24,733
- Ah, great.

1662
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:26,233
Just what we need.

1663
01:15:26,233 --> 01:15:27,667
- What?

1664
01:15:27,667 --> 01:15:28,800
- There's a couple of kids
messin' around out there again.

1665
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,533
Let's go rouse them out.

1666
01:15:30,533 --> 01:15:31,867
- Ah, the heck with it.

1667
01:15:31,867 --> 01:15:33,067
Call the cops.

1668
01:15:33,067 --> 01:15:34,600
Let them chase 'em.

1669
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,900
- Thank you.

1670
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:42,733
I'm okay.

1671
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:46,967
- Leon, Billy will
 never make it.

1672
01:15:46,967 --> 01:15:48,700
- Look, I'm gonna go around.

1673
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:49,933
I'm gonna try and
 find an opening

1674
01:15:49,933 --> 01:15:51,433
where both you guys
 can get through.

1675
01:15:51,433 --> 01:15:52,667
- Well maybe I
 should go with you.

1676
01:15:52,667 --> 01:15:55,567
- No, you stay with Billy.

1677
01:15:55,567 --> 01:15:56,400
- Okay.

1678
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,467
- You okay?

1679
01:15:57,467 --> 01:15:58,367
Okay.

1680
01:15:58,367 --> 01:16:01,233
(suspenseful music)

1681
01:16:01,233 --> 01:16:04,467
(wailing police siren)

1682
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:08,067
- This is your fault!

1683
01:16:08,067 --> 01:16:09,233
- I'm sorry, it's your fault!

1684
01:16:09,233 --> 01:16:11,400
- No, it's your fault!

1685
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,133
- You're the one who
got us into this anyway!

1686
01:16:14,133 --> 01:16:16,133
- Would you two shut up?

1687
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:33,233
You just sit there and shut up.

1688
01:16:33,233 --> 01:16:35,500
- I'll do whatever
 I want, copper!

1689
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,233
You can't tell me what
 to do with your badge,

1690
01:16:37,233 --> 01:16:40,367
and your cop guh,
 oh is that a gun?

1691
01:16:40,367 --> 01:16:41,800
I'm sorry, do whatever you want.

1692
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:42,967
Carry on, sir!

1693
01:16:44,133 --> 01:16:46,167
I can't go to jail, you
can't let 'em take me!

1694
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:47,967
I'm very fragile, you know.

1695
01:16:47,967 --> 01:16:52,833
Institution food makes me
 gassy just thinkin' about it.

1696
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:54,267
I can't go to jail, Cora!

1697
01:16:54,267 --> 01:16:56,400
For the love of
 god, Cora, I can't--

1698
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,200
- Pull yourself together, man.

1699
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,633
(jazzy bass)

1700
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:07,267
- [Voiceover] All units, 714.

1701
01:17:07,267 --> 01:17:08,867
Three perpetrators have
 entered the complex at the old

1702
01:17:08,867 --> 01:17:11,200
Wayland River, they're
described as 12 to 13-years-old.

1703
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,533
Do you copy?
 - [Cora] That's them!

1704
01:17:13,533 --> 01:17:15,200
We're bustin' out of here
 and gettin' revenge on those

1705
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,067
little narc kids!
 - [Willy] Yeah?

1706
01:17:17,067 --> 01:17:18,333
- [Cora] Yeah.
 - [Willy] How?

1707
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:19,267
- The keys!

1708
01:17:20,467 --> 01:17:23,400
All we gotta do is
 open up the door.

1709
01:17:27,633 --> 01:17:28,867
Hey.

1710
01:17:28,867 --> 01:17:31,567
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

1711
01:17:31,567 --> 01:17:32,900
- What, that that
little girl looks a lot

1712
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:35,167
like our sister Darla?

1713
01:17:35,167 --> 01:17:39,467
Of course, Darla's got a lot
 more tattoos and facial hair.

1714
01:17:39,467 --> 01:17:41,700
- Hi, little girl, little girl!

1715
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:44,133
Sweet one, come open the door.

1716
01:17:44,133 --> 01:17:45,467
You little brat.

1717
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:47,833
- What did you say?

1718
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:50,167
- Come on, open the door,
 open the door for Cora!

1719
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:51,767
Yeah, that's right.

1720
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:57,067
(dramatic music)

1721
01:18:00,533 --> 01:18:01,333
(door knock)

1722
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:02,500
- Hey, pal?

1723
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:05,867
Two elephants are
taking off in your car!

1724
01:18:05,867 --> 01:18:07,367
- Call for backup!

1725
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,067
(sighs)

1726
01:18:14,067 --> 01:18:16,733
(car screeches)

1727
01:18:17,667 --> 01:18:19,367
- Oh, Leon.

1728
01:18:19,367 --> 01:18:20,733
What took you so long?

1729
01:18:20,733 --> 01:18:22,200
- Fence goes on forever.

1730
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,067
I think I found a place where
 you guys can get through.

1731
01:18:24,067 --> 01:18:25,333
- Oh, good.

1732
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:27,433
Billy, come on, let's go!

1733
01:18:27,433 --> 01:18:28,900
- I can't get up!

1734
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,100
- Oh my gosh.

1735
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:32,767
He's turning into a statue!

1736
01:18:32,767 --> 01:18:33,767
- [Billy] Get off.

1737
01:18:33,767 --> 01:18:36,367
- Shoo, get out of here!

1738
01:18:36,367 --> 01:18:37,700
- Great, it's almost noon.

1739
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:40,400
- We gotta carry him, come on.

1740
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,933
One, two, three.

1741
01:18:41,933 --> 01:18:46,100
(suspenseful music)
 (Leon and Hannah grunting)

1742
01:18:47,167 --> 01:18:50,400
- [Hannah] Let's rest.
 - [Leon] Okay.

1743
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:53,667
(wailing police siren)

1744
01:18:55,367 --> 01:18:56,367
Wait.

1745
01:18:56,367 --> 01:18:57,867
Did you hear that?

1746
01:18:59,133 --> 01:19:00,533
- Hurry!

1747
01:19:00,533 --> 01:19:04,233
Come on, let's go.
 - [Leon] All right, let's go.

1748
01:19:07,633 --> 01:19:08,867
- You two are cops?

1749
01:19:08,867 --> 01:19:10,467
- Uh yeah, that's who
 we are, we're cops!

1750
01:19:10,467 --> 01:19:11,767
Undercover.

1751
01:19:11,767 --> 01:19:13,100
Where are the little punks?

1752
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:14,567
I mean, the suspects, of course.

1753
01:19:14,567 --> 01:19:15,567
- By the canal bank.

1754
01:19:15,567 --> 01:19:16,633
Come on, I'll show you.

1755
01:19:16,633 --> 01:19:18,067
- No, you wait here.

1756
01:19:18,067 --> 01:19:19,600
This is police business.

1757
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,433
- Right!

1758
01:19:20,433 --> 01:19:21,633
Police business.

1759
01:19:21,633 --> 01:19:23,300
I began my covert
 activity training back

1760
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,067
in my cub scout days,
 although I admit that was...

1761
01:19:26,067 --> 01:19:26,867
Excuse us.

1762
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:33,233
- Hang in there, Billy.

1763
01:19:33,233 --> 01:19:34,800
We're almost there.

1764
01:19:35,967 --> 01:19:38,533
(Willy groans)

1765
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,600
(Willy panting)

1766
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,833
- [Cora] There.
- [Willy] What?

1767
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:46,100
- [Cora] There they are.
- [Willy] What?

1768
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:48,500
- There they are right there.

1769
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:49,300
There!

1770
01:19:53,567 --> 01:19:56,700
(Willy and Cora groaning)

1771
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:58,767
- All right, now what do we do?

1772
01:19:58,767 --> 01:20:00,567
- Look, he's gotta
 jump in himself.

1773
01:20:00,567 --> 01:20:03,000
- He can't, he's a statue.

1774
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,700
- Look, we gotta push him.

1775
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,100
- All right, help me.

1776
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:07,367
- You can swim, right?

1777
01:20:07,367 --> 01:20:09,000
(Billy mumbles)

1778
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,667
I hope that's a yes.

1779
01:20:10,667 --> 01:20:11,500
Okay.

1780
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:12,633
One, two--

1781
01:20:12,633 --> 01:20:13,967
(Hannah gasps)

1782
01:20:13,967 --> 01:20:14,800
Let her go!

1783
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,233
- Hey you, be quiet!

1784
01:20:16,233 --> 01:20:18,267
I'm the one makin' the
 rules around here now.

1785
01:20:18,267 --> 01:20:19,600
So if you'll kindly step back

1786
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,200
from your little
 gold friend here,

1787
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:23,067
your sister won't
 have to go for a swim.

1788
01:20:23,067 --> 01:20:25,467
- Bet you two thought
you were rid of us, huh?

1789
01:20:25,467 --> 01:20:27,533
- You guys don't understand,
 he'll die in there.

1790
01:20:27,533 --> 01:20:29,033
- Shut up!

1791
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:31,967
It looks like your little
 pal's almost solid gold now.

1792
01:20:31,967 --> 01:20:33,100
Let's get him!

1793
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:36,167
Ow, my head, ow!
(dark atmospheric music)

1794
01:20:36,167 --> 01:20:37,367
- Do you see him?

1795
01:20:37,367 --> 01:20:39,133
Come on, Billy, come on.
(suspenseful music)

1796
01:20:39,133 --> 01:20:40,400
- Where is he?

1797
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,600
- He should be up by now.

1798
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,433
- Billy!

1799
01:20:43,367 --> 01:20:44,300
- [Leon] Come on, Billy.

1800
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:45,133
- Billy!

1801
01:20:46,033 --> 01:20:47,433
- Do you see him?

1802
01:20:48,733 --> 01:20:49,733
Where is he?

1803
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,533
Hey!

1804
01:20:55,533 --> 01:20:56,367
Billy!

1805
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,633
(uplifting music)
 (Billy gasping)

1806
01:21:05,633 --> 01:21:08,400
- All right, Billy!
 (Leon chuckles)

1807
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,133
- [Billy] Yeah, yeah!

1808
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,233
- You know, I think you and
 me could work somethin' out!

1809
01:21:14,233 --> 01:21:17,567
- No deal, fatso, you're
goin' up the river.

1810
01:21:17,567 --> 01:21:18,500
- [Cora] He did it!

1811
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:21,333
(Leon chuckles)

1812
01:21:21,333 --> 01:21:22,767
- All right, you guys.

1813
01:21:22,767 --> 01:21:24,700
I don't wanna see you
 playing around here anymore.

1814
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:26,267
This water ain't for swimmin'.

1815
01:21:26,267 --> 01:21:27,833
As some of you may
 have found out.

1816
01:21:27,833 --> 01:21:28,967
- [Children]
 (laughing) Yes, sir.

1817
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:30,433
We understand, sir.

1818
01:21:30,433 --> 01:21:31,767
- All right, get out of here.

1819
01:21:31,767 --> 01:21:32,833
- Let's get out!

1820
01:21:32,833 --> 01:21:36,067
(upbeat music)

1821
01:21:36,067 --> 01:21:38,467
- So, we're officially
 buds now, right?

1822
01:21:38,467 --> 01:21:39,800
- Sure, why not?

1823
01:21:40,867 --> 01:21:41,700
- Hannah?

1824
01:21:42,567 --> 01:21:44,200
Buds?

1825
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,567
- All right.

1826
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:48,333
I guess we can
 hang out together.

1827
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:50,233
I'll even overlook
 the doll thing.

1828
01:21:50,233 --> 01:21:52,933
- They're action figures.

1829
01:21:52,933 --> 01:21:54,400
- Action figures.

1830
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,833
That's what I meant.

1831
01:21:56,833 --> 01:22:01,067
(children talking
 over each other)

1832
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:07,933
- Good morning, class.

1833
01:22:07,933 --> 01:22:10,400
- [Children] Good
morning, Miss Henderson.

1834
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:14,067
- Well, boys, do you
 have your assignments?

1835
01:22:17,533 --> 01:22:19,800
- I hope, Billy, that now
 you will think twice before

1836
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,133
copying someone else's work.

1837
01:22:23,067 --> 01:22:24,333
- Yes, Miss Henderson.

1838
01:22:24,333 --> 01:22:25,533
(children laughing)

1839
01:22:25,533 --> 01:22:26,700
- Settle down.

1840
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:32,400
Everyone take out their
 texts and turn to page 60.

1841
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,600
Leon?

1842
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,600
Are you going on strike again?

1843
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,500
- No, I just have
 something to say.

1844
01:22:40,467 --> 01:22:42,667
Last Friday I told you

1845
01:22:42,667 --> 01:22:44,967
that Billy cheated off me.

1846
01:22:44,967 --> 01:22:47,200
(sighs) But the truth
is I cheated off Billy.

1847
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,933
He was innocent.

1848
01:22:48,933 --> 01:22:49,933
- Excuse me?

1849
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,267
- (sighs) I lied.

1850
01:22:53,267 --> 01:22:54,533
It was my fault.

1851
01:22:54,533 --> 01:22:56,133
I'm sorry.

1852
01:22:56,133 --> 01:22:57,800
- Let me get this straight.

1853
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,467
You are apologizing?

1854
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:04,733
Max, go get the school nurse!

1855
01:23:06,167 --> 01:23:07,733
I was...

1856
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:09,067
I was kidding.

1857
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:10,367
Van, go get Max.

1858
01:23:11,933 --> 01:23:13,067
I'm not kidding.

1859
01:23:13,067 --> 01:23:16,500
(children laughing)

1860
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:17,333
- Thanks.

1861
01:23:19,133 --> 01:23:20,867
- Magic spells?

1862
01:23:20,867 --> 01:23:22,500
Gold grandmothers?

1863
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,433
What do you call this?

1864
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:25,700
- My weekend.

1865
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:28,300
(upbeat music)

1866
01:23:34,367 --> 01:23:36,067
No way.

1867
01:23:36,067 --> 01:23:36,833
No way.

1868

"I told you in life to take
 the bitter with the sweet.

1869
01:23:53,267 --> 01:23:57,100
"You've had a little bitter
and now here's a little sweet."

1870
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,367
Madame Latimer?

1871
01:24:03,267 --> 01:24:04,533
The witch-lady!

1872
01:24:06,367 --> 01:24:07,200
Granny!

1873
01:24:08,467 --> 01:24:10,067
(upbeat music)

1874
01:24:10,067 --> 01:24:11,267
Hey, Gran.

1875
01:24:11,267 --> 01:24:12,800
How do you feel?

1876
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,133
- 20 years younger.

1877
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:15,233
- Hey, you wanna race?

1878
01:24:15,233 --> 01:24:18,167
- Yeah. (chuckles)

1879
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,400
- Oh, how was that?

1880
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,633
- You show-off.

1881
01:24:25,633 --> 01:24:26,600
- Not bad, huh?

1882
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:27,900
Four miles.

1883
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,467
Beat my own record.

1884
01:24:31,067 --> 01:24:32,667
- Looks good, Gran.

1885
01:24:34,767 --> 01:24:37,267
- See you after work.

1886
01:24:37,267 --> 01:24:39,500
(chuckles)

1887
01:25:07,367 --> 01:25:08,867
- Nice touch, kid!
