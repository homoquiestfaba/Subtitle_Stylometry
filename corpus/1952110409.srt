00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:16,240
You know, the whole
spirit of giving, all that?

550
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,611
And then, when he found out
there were no birds

551
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,047
at the Nativity,

552
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,346
he actually went
and scooped it back

553
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,216
and put it back
in the freezer

554
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,516
mixed in
with all the bird seed.

Okay, so you
don't like clubs.

You don't really
have any friends or hobbies.

564
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:55,644
And you're not
very good with spinning.

00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,620
Well, what is it
that you like to do?

566

This is where I go
to read and write and relax.

Wow.

00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,400
Yeah.

572
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,045
Isn't it strange?

The world is so big,
all that space.

574
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,619
People still want to pack
themselves in tiny little boxes

575

and stack them
on top of each other.

576
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,660
You should get
a telescope up here.

577
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:42,254
You could spy on
all those corporate crooks,

banging their secretaries.

579
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,231
I've thought
about that.

580
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:53,936
Yeah, but then again,
they could be watching you.

581
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,045
Maybe.

I don't know
how to put this.

586
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,053
Given the history here,

587
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,892
is it possible that,
subconsciously,

588
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:18,025
you're looking for me
to replace your brother?

589
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:21,536

594

Maybe half.

Who are you quoting here
in the third paragraph?

Thas Brooke.

624
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,198
Oh.

00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,740
Who's Brooke?

And I thought
we talked about Tom Clancy.

627
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,210
Is Byron Brooke.

628
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,577
He's an 18th-Century
poet and writer.

Well, yeah.

00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,312
Sounds like Shakespeare.

632
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,448
Is Brooke
maybe too obscure?

633
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,787
I mean, I don't want to be
labeled a pretentious asshole

634
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,692
because I'm quoting some poet
that nobody's heard of.

635
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,856
Brooke is well respected.

636
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,261
He's not obscure at all.

637
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:06,598
If you want, I could
show you his bibliography.

I was thinking about
Edgar Allan Poe.

646
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,198
What about him?

647
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,426

of his poems once.

00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,996
I know is a choice.

734
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:20,365
I guess it sounds
kind of crazy.

735
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:23,268
Man, I don't know.

736
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:25,398
You shouldn't ask me.

737
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:29,035
I cheated on my ex-wife
with her therapist.

738
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:30,612
I'm not smart.

739
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:36,746
See you.

740
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,591
So when are you going to let me
read some of your stuff?

741
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,291
What do you want
to read?

742
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:52,732
I don't care.
Anything.

743
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:56,203
I didn't really
bring anything with me.

744
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,830
I didn't mean now.

745
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,216
Oh, I got
to check out this tub.

00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:22,258
(Evan)
Most days,
I lie encased in a dream,

747
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:24,367
kicking and screaming,

748
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,992
unable to wake forfear
of breathing in the poison

749
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:29,935
that too long sustained me.

750
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:31,735
So I hold my breath,

751
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,672
writhing in agony,

752
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:36,302
until the day
I can sleep eternal

753
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,846
and dream no more.

754
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,033
How's yourfish?

755
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:04,401
Is good.

756
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,701
Is not too fishy.

757
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,534
What are you doing?

758
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,800
Oh, sorry.

759
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,875
I just...
I picked up your book,

760
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,672
and this came...

761
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:48,115
God, Evan,
this is really dark.

762
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,948
Did you write this?

763
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:56,890
Yeah, is a speech
for a script I'm writing.

764
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,527
Oh, you're writing a script?

765
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:02,791
Mm, screenplay.

766
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:03,957
I just started it.

767
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,295
Cool.

768
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,529
Whas it about?

769
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,730
Well, just...

770
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:14,970
Is about a cop
who goes undercover and...

771
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:19,446
deep undercover, and he gets
involved with the drug people,

772
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,847
and they kidnap his wife.

773
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:22,952
Yeah.

774
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:24,054
So thas the plot?

775
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:28,522
Mm-hmm, broad strokes.

776
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,064
It sounds a little derivative,
doesn't it?

777
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:35,825
Really?

778
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:36,933
No, I mean,
I don't think so.

779
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,659
Is...

780
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:42,602

is execution-driven,

I'm sorry
to call you at home.

No, is okay.

Ooh, uh...

00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:02,651
I'm sorry, Abel.

I'm not ready
to show you the new draft yet.

No, no, is okay.

Oh, I feel good today.

00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:39,494
I don't know why.

807
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,997
It started this morning
when I took a really great dump.

808
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:46,400
So how was your trip?

809
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:49,666
It was good.

810
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:52,905
You like this chick.
I can tell.

Just don't
fuck her in the ass.

812

I don't know.

816
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:06,790
Is fine.

817
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:07,891
Shitty.

818
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,425
Fine.

819
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:11,619
I love music.

820
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:13,730
I just wish I didn't need it
to pay the bills.

821
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,827
Yeah, but if you didn't
write music, what would you do,

822
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:20,937
right?

823
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:27,334
I would buy a cliff.

824
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:28,842
Huh?

825
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:33,006
I would buy a cliff where people
could come and throw shit off,

826

or computers orwhatever,

things that piss them off
'cause they didn't work right,

828
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,015
like an outlet
for machine rage.

829
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,684
And the whole thing would be
videotaped in slow motion

830
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:46,989
so they could
watch their heap of shit

break into
a million pieces back at home.

Plus, for an extra couple bucks,

833
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:55,803
I would attach an explosive
so it would blow up on impact,

00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:58,305
just like they do in the movies,
a big fireball.

a jump on traffic.

that you know exactly
how long we've been dating.

goddaughter Robin,

are in Guatemala or somewhere,

what his deal is,

but he's her

do me a favor.

on the bed.

pick me out one?

What do you say
we skip the tie for dinner,

874
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:55,782
and we figure out a way
to use them later?

875
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:57,587
Okay.

876
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,059
Are you ready?

877
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:00,993

878
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,669
This is good soup.

879
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:08,771
Yeah, is great.

880
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,807
Is really delicious.

882
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,874
So, Charlotte,
are you working right now?

883
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,309
Yeah.

884
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:21,748
I'm doing some consuiting work
at a pharmaceutical company.

885
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:23,512
Is just temporary.

886
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,314
I think they're
being investigated.

887
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:26,479
Why?

888
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:28,250
Oh, my.

889
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:29,654
Yeah, well,
don't worry, Mom.

890
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:32,284
I'm not exactly thrilled about
my parking space anyway.

891
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:36,632
And you're a writer?

892
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:37,927
Yes, I am.

893
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:40,127
Do you enjoy that?

894
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,170
For the most part.

895
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:44,739
I believe Clare
is studying to be a writer.

896
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,342
Well, I'm a journalism major.

897
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:50,640
What do you write?

898
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:52,009
Mostly freelance.

899
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,174

900
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:55,750
Well, that must be fascinating.

901
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,183
I guess so.

905
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,753
(Evan)
Yes, I believe so.

906
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,229
I don't think I could
ever be a novelist.

907
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,926
It just seems
like such a lonely life.

908
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:15,197
And I'm just too much
of a people person.

909
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:17,067
Well, you got to go
with your gifts.

910
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:18,333
Right?

911
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:21,375
Plus, I think
I'm too type-A

912
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:24,105
to ever treat writing
like a vacation, you know?

913
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,874
Vocation.

914
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,541
Oh, I thought
you said "vacation."

915
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:30,550
Right, I didn't.

916
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:38,188
Evan, Charlotte tells me that
you went to Cornell with Matty.

917
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:41,058
Yes, I did.

918
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:42,324
Greg's at Cornell too.

919
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:44,093
He's a sophomore.

920
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:45,201
No kidding.

921
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:47,496
How do you like it?

922
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:48,604
Is pretty cool.

923
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:51,206
Dorm kind of sucks, though.

924
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:54,174
Where'd you live
when you were there?

925
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,770
I lived off-campus.

926
00:51:57,914 --> 00:51:59,905
Not freshman year,
right?

927
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,518
Right.

928
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:04,711
I can't remember my dorm
freshman year right now.

929
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,186
It seems it slipped my mind.

930
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,224
North campus,
Keller Hall,

931
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,553
Sterling Quad?

932
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:13,060
Sterling Quad,
on the tip of my tongue.

933
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:17,027
Those dorms
aren't too bad.

934
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:27,567
You in line
for the bathroom?

935
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,576
Yep.

936
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,007
So your parents
are in Guatemala?

937
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:39,547
Why'd they go there?

938
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,882
'Cause God told them to.

939
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:47,222
Oh.

940
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,802
Hey.
Hey.

941
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,733
So when you headed
back to New York?

942
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,270
Thursday, I think.

943
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:58,874
Mm-hmm.

944
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,840
Evan is interesting.

945
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:05,570
Well, thas
bravely noncommittal.

946
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:08,013
Where'd you meet him?

947
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:10,551
At Matty's funeral.

948
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,315
I know
that sounds strange.

949
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:15,754
Well, not that it matters,

950
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:18,861
but your boyfriend
did not go to Cornell.

951
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:22,958
What?

952
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:38,637
These are cute baby pictures.

953
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:39,771
Yeah, they're adorable.

954
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,747
Kitridge Hall
and Sterling Quad don't exist.

955
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,375
You neverwent
to fucking Cornell.

956
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,318
Just thought I'd spare you
any further embarrassment.

957
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:47,480
So les start over.

958
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:49,615
I'm Charlotte.
Who the fuck are you?

959
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:50,953
Here we are.

960
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:56,330
I don't know
how you take yourcoffee,

961
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:59,026
but I have both sugar
and SweeN Low.

962
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:02,297
Please, sit.
Sit, sit, sit.

963
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:08,207
Francis, would you
like cream in your coffee?

964
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:09,937
I think you'd
enjoy some cream.

965
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:14,173
So, Evan,

966
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:18,083
how long have you lived
in Los Angeles?

967
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:20,246
Um, about five years.

968
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,858
Ah.

969
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:25,757
So you found
a happy home here.

970
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:27,863
I think so.

971
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:29,522
I neverwent to Cornell.

972
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:33,202
I'm sorry?

973
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:37,233
I neverwent to Cornell.

974
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:39,865
I went to a small community
college outside of Philadelphia.

975
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,247
Oh.

976
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:48,476
After I graduated, I...

977
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:52,554
I wrote for a men's
health journal in Ithaca.

978
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,157
Thas where
I met Matt.

979
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,260
We shared
a bus route.

980
00:54:57,394 --> 00:55:00,852
You rode a bus together?

981
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:06,866
I told you
that we went to school together

982
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:10,234
because I thought that would
somehow seem less random.

983
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,875
I was nervous to meet you.

984
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:17,674
Why?

985
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:23,775
I have a picture.

986
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,355
I...

987
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,152
traded Matt bus fare
for a picture

988
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,227
he had in his wallet one day.

989
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:35,854
What picture?

990
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:45,836
Why would you want this?

991
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:49,706
Because I thought
you were beautiful.

992
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,509
(Evan)
For me,

993
00:55:57,654 --> 00:56:01,385
hell has reserved
a special place

994
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:08,453
where I sit and talk
and scare myself to death

995
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:11,499
a little bit more
each day.

996
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:24,575
[Telephone ringing]

997
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,043
You're an asshole.

998
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:35,624
You know that, right?

999
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:36,885
Yeah.

1000
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:44,698
So here's
yourwarning shot.

1001
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:46,927
I'm willing
to look past this

1002
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,698
on one condition:

1003
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:53,002
From now on,

1004
00:56:53,143 --> 00:57:00,549
no matter how insignificant
or justifiable orfucking noble

1005
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:03,277
it may seem
at the time,

1006
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,413
you won't ever,
ever lie to me again.

1007
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:14,424
Okay?

1008
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:15,792
Okay.

1009
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:22,236
You rode
the bus together.

1010
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:23,361
Yeah.

1011
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:24,530
I had to think fast.

1012
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:26,403
Is the best
I could come up with.

1013
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:27,874
I really did have a job
in Ithaca once.

1014
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:30,673
That wasn't a lie.

1015
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:33,510
I think we got to rework
the second paragraph.

1016
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:34,776
I sound nuts here.

1017
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:36,351
What the fuck
am I doing?

1018
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:37,748
So you lied.

1019
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:40,947
Just don't do it agaln
If it bothers you that much.

1020
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:44,617
And if it was really meant
to be, then, you know...

1021
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:45,728
all that shit.

1022
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,227
What do you mean "nuts"?

1023
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:48,330
Just tell her
you're sorry.

1024
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,763
Get her some flowers
and buy her a puppy.

1025
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,333
Chicks love puppies, man.

1026
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,027
I'm telling you.

1027
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,262
They're like heroin
with fur.

1028
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:58,238
I don't know
what the hell I was thinking.

1029
00:57:58,374 --> 00:57:59,341
This is crazy.

1030
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,670
Well, you know
what they say.

1031
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,903
If you want to make an omelet,
you got to break some eggs.

1032
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:04,411
How does that apply here?

1033
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:05,980
I don't know.

1034
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:07,343
You're being
very tense.

1035
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,351
We got to get out of here.

1036
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,613
What?

1037
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:12,914
Stress therapy.

1038
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,023
A little field trip.

1039
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,785
I got just the thing
to clear your head.

1040
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:18,223
Trust me.

1041
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:30,229
Why are we sitting here?

1042
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:32,136
We're looking
for our mark.

1043
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:33,640
Mark?
What mark?

1044
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:36,609
Just...
don't worry.

1045
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,179
We got to be patient.

1046
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:44,948
Do you want a smoothie?

1047
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:46,214
No.

1048
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,515
Oh.

1049
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,627
How perfect.
Perfect.

1050
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:52,728
- What?
- Come on.

1051
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:53,829
Come on, now listen.

1052
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,658
Stay close,
and no matterwhat I do,

1053
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:57,265
don't make any sound at all.

1054
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,662
All right?
Is important.

1056
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,218
Ah, you okay?

Oh, man.

1061
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,034
You've got to try that.

1062

Oh, come on.

1066
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:40,333
What do you remember
from that age?

1067
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:41,443
Nothing.

1068
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,773
This is so harmless.

1069
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:47,872
If anything I'm endowing him
with a very necessary distrust

1070

of strangers.

1071
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:53,116
Their parents
should be thanking me.

1072
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,486
This is healthy
and primal.

1073
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:56,592
Come on.
You'll see.

1074
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:57,693
No.

1075
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:59,124
Are you kidding?

1076
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,891
Oh, Jesus, what is it with this
cultural reverence of babies?

'Cause I got news for you,

1078

just because
you're short and chubby,

01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:09,830
that doesn't mean
you're not an asshole.

01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:17,976

But I'm back on now,
and is better.

1090
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:44,365

it out with us, you know,

01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,634

No, not really.

1095
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:57,751
The 1-10 overpass
at Victory.

1096
01:00:57,887 --> 01:00:58,979
Is nice and high.

1097
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:00,749
And is a pretty
nostalgic spot for me.

1098
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,381
About slx years ago,

1099
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:04,493
I got offered an intervlew

1100
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:06,561
for the
musical director position

1101
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:09,597
at the Los Angeles
Master Chorale.

1102
01:01:09,732 --> 01:01:11,791
My then-wife's father
was on the board.

1103
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:14,767
But that morning,
a truck jackknifed

1104
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,872
on the freeway,

1105
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:20,339
and I sat in traffic right in
that spot underthe overpass.

1106
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:24,037
Three hours,
I just say there.

1107
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,011
Of course, I missed
the interview completely,

1108
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:27,343
didn't get the job.

1109
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:33,154
Anyway, thas where
I'm going to jump.

1110
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:36,156
See if I can't make some other
shitheads late that morning.

1111
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:41,895
(Charlotte)
So how's
your screenplay coming along?

1112
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,495
Um, beginning stages,
really.

1113
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:47,762
Why?

1114
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:51,670
Well, I was thinking about it,
and I have this friend.

1115
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:53,867
He's actually this guy
in my yoga class

1116
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,102
who's a screenwriter.

1117
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:58,873
And I was thinking maybe
you guys could get together,

1118
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:01,108
and you could, like,
tell him your ideas.

1119
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,979
He could give you feedback.

1120
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,144
I mean, you know,
is such a tough industry.

1121
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:06,585
Yeah.
Yeah, thanks.

1122
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,351
Is something
to think about.

1123
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:12,256
So you're open to it?

1124
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,363
Sure.

1125
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:19,059
Good, because I actually
asked him to join us for lunch.

1126
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:20,794
What?

1127
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:22,131
Oh, is totally casual.

1128
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:24,262
I mean, is not like you
have to pitch him or anything.

1129
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,466
Jesus, Charlotte,
why didn't you ask me first?

1130
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:28,474
I just did,
and you said you were open...

1131
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:30,010
Yeah, I'm open to it,
but what the fuck?

1132
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:32,205
You're fucking trapping me here,
you know that?

1133
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:34,077
Fuck.

1134
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,845
God, Evan...

1135
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:38,317
I would never
try and trap you.

1136
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:39,421
I'm sorry.

1137
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:41,284
I was just
trying to help.

1138
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,593
I care about you, Evan.

1139
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:46,922
He's here.

1140
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:48,462
Don't worry.
I'll fix it.

1141
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:52,227
I'll just tell him that we don't
want to talk about the script.

1142
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:53,801
- Hey, Brady.
- Hey, Charlotte.

1143
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:54,903
Hey, thanks for coming.

1144
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:58,598
Uh, Brady the screenwriter,

1145
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:00,902
this is Evan the poet.

1146
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:05,075
Yeah, we've...
we've met.

1147
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:07,116
Really?

1148
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,683
No, I don't think so.

1149
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:09,807
But I get that a lot.

1150
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,783
Now, I know
your time is valuable,

1151
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:13,081
but Charlotte
thought you could

1152
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:14,951
brainstorm
a few points on my script.

1153
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:19,118
Is about a cop
who goes undercover

1154
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:21,890
to work with a drug dealer.

1155
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:24,056
Now, the cop has a friend

1156
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,760
who also knows
the drug dealer.

1157
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:29,838
But the friend
doesn't tell the drug dealer

1158
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,236
what the cop
really does for a living.

1159
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:36,979
Why not?

1160
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:39,638
Because friends
are super cool that way.

1161
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,249
[Chuckles]

1162
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:43,511
Huh.

1163
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:50,286
Or maybe the cop sweetens
the deal for his friend.

1164
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:53,162
You mean
like a payoff?

1165
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:54,854
Ooh, I like that.

1166
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,055
Sounds good.

1167
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:58,997
What kind of payoff
are we talking about?

1168
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:00,159
I don't know.

1169
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:02,999
Throw out a number.

1170
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:06,370
Okay, maybe $200.

1171
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,607
200 bucks?
Are you kidding?

1172
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:10,803
Shh.
My movie.

1173
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:12,278
No, I think Charlotte
might be right.

1174
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:15,748
I was thinking
more like $1,000.

1175
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:16,943
At least.

1176
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:19,418
Um, but don't
you think that would

1177
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,045
totally destroy the friendship?

1178
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,624
Yeah.

1179
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:25,954
Yeah, but you're writing drama.

1180
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:27,494
And that would be
very dramatic.

1181
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:52,012
You're quiet tonight.

1182
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:54,418
Am I?

1183
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:55,956
What are you thinking?

1184
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:03,088
Today woulïve been
Matty's 31st birthday.

1185
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,427
Oh.

1186
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,537
Just kind of creeps up on me
sometimes, you know?

1187
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,804
Yeah.

1188
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:15,774
You want to be alone?

1189
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,345
No.

1190
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,447
I don't know.
No.

1191
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:27,180
I rememberwanting this stuffed
giraffe when I was a kid.

1192
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:31,316
My parents weren't clued in
enough to get one for me.

1193
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:36,189
Maybe thas why
I haven't found a career.

1194
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,697
Maybe thas why
I bite my nails.

1195
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:46,798
What time do you
have to get up forwork?

1196
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,877
7:00.

1197
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:50,569
Hey, do you want
to meet me for lunch?

1198
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:53,238
Um, I can't.

1199
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:55,441
There's this thing.

1200
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:58,712
Is a poetry symposium
at UCLA.

1201
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:00,617
Fun.

1202
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,459
You don't get
a lot of women, do you?

1203
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,091
No, not a lot.

1204
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,437
I can tell by the way
you look at me.

1205
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:19,905
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to look...

1206
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:23,842
I need to do this
as quickly as possible.

1207
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,880
How does it work?

1208

Yeah, I put It
on his desk this morning.

No, I already
talked to him about it.

Hey, Robin.

You guys look comfortable.

1223
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:20,658
What are you watching?

1224
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:22,065
No way.

1225
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:23,762
Where'd you find this?

Afriend of mine works in
archives at the TV Academy.

1227

called it "spellbinding."

And you didn't tell me
Susan Lucci played your mom.

1235
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:42,082
You did not ask.

1236
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,489
So you don't want
to watch it with us, do you?

1237

By the way,
I saw you having lunch today

1244

when I was driving
through Silver Lake.

1245

What was that?

1246
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,773
Didn't you have that
poetry thing in Westwood?

1247
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,510
I did.

did that go on for?

think of a single thing.

Nothing.

Maybe you should take
a few more days.

1264
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:30,656
I go through the motions,

1265
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:33,495
and I don't know
what to search for anymore.

1266
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:42,009
I think when we finally
stop looking for answers,

1267
01:09:42,144 --> 01:09:43,873
the questions
will fade away too.

1268

01:23:04,879 --> 01:23:08,110
And if there is,

1448
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:09,443
what are your plans?

1449
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:11,814
I was going
to play it by ear.

1450
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:15,552
Now, shut up, please.

1451
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,093
Don't.

1452
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,424
I have no choice.

1453
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:29,233
Please don't.

1454
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,864
Why shouldn't I?

1455
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,100
No reason.

1456
01:23:34,242 --> 01:23:37,678
Only, do it tomorrow.

1457
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:40,781
Let me buy you
a slice of pizza.

1458
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:42,940
I could use
a slice of pizza.

1459
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:44,574
You wouldn't believe
the day I've had.

1460
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:50,757
For me.

1461
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:52,484
Do it for that reason?

1462
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:55,561
Thas not enough, Evan.

1463
01:23:58,133 --> 01:23:59,259
I'm sorry.

1464
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:00,390
It isn't.

Hey.

1471
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:08,064

you were someone else.

Yeah.

Actually, I thought
you were the movers.

1475
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:17,973
They're late.

1476
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:22,105

to yourface?

Nothing.

Altercation.

1479
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:28,687
An altercation?

1480
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:32,693
Jesus, Evan.

1481
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:43,333
I'm not sure
really why I came.

1482
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:44,438
I'm glad you did.

1483
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:45,766
Fuck you.

1484
01:25:45,907 --> 01:25:47,772
Well, then.

1485
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:50,742
And who the fuck are you?

1486
01:25:56,184 --> 01:25:59,449
I'm not really sure.

1487
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:02,385
I've been living
with some issues.

1488
01:26:07,529 --> 01:26:10,054
In the past,

1489
01:26:10,198 --> 01:26:11,256
I would manage those issues

1490
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:13,594
by writing about
other people's pain.

1491
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:15,970

1494
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:25,104
Growing up in the foster system
can be kind of complicated.

1495
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:30,250
Right, fuck it.

1496
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:32,615
Who knows why we do
what we do, really?

1497
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:36,457
I decided
to stop writing.

1498
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:38,183
I'm going
to start a business,

1499

out of state, I think.

1500
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:42,087
Maybe I'll
come back in a year.

1501
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:43,197
I don't know.

1502

1503
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:56,171

1504

that I lost my brother,

1509
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,551

that I wasn't there

when he needed someone.

1511
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,797
And I wanted you
to know that.

1512
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:29,067
So...

1513
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,837
I'm going to go.

1514
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:37,384
Is that for me?

1515
01:27:38,519 --> 01:27:40,214
Yeah.

1516
01:27:43,124 --> 01:27:46,150
Well, if you do come back
in a year or so,

1517
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:49,422
maybe give me a call,
let me know you're alive.

1518
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:55,967
I probably
won't want to see you.

1519
01:28:15,657 --> 01:28:17,147
Okay.

1520
01:28:28,369 --> 01:28:31,566
So um,
how does this work?

1521
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:32,730
