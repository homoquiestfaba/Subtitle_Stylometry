17
00:01:55,184 --> 00:01:56,771
 - You're just a fucking pig!

18
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:07,679
- I want to, I want to.

19
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:09,163
and I'm gonna get it done,

20
00:02:09,198 --> 00:02:10,440
 it's too hard right
 now, I'm gonna get--

21
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,900
- Whatever?

22
00:02:23,073 --> 00:02:24,178
You're such a fucking pig!

23
00:02:34,913 --> 00:02:36,535
- Just hanging out,

24
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,950
 it's not even a big deal!

25
00:02:37,985 --> 00:02:39,228
- I'm always home!

26
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:57,867
 - This has gotta stop.

27
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:59,420
- What?

28
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:01,077
 Say something.

29
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:22,271
 Fuck.

30
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:35,353
Asshole!

31
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:36,216
 God!

32
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,423
 Oh, hey, man, you
 dropped some quarters.

33
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:30,537
One came all the way over here,

34
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:34,506
if you care.

35
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,998
Hey, I have that shirt.

36
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:49,245
- Yeah, you're wearing
yours, this one's mine.

37
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:51,385
 Look, do I know you?

38
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,145
- Yeah, I think we're neighbors.

39
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,802
- No, I didn't ask you
if you'd seen me before.

40
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:56,770
I asked if you know me.

41
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:00,705
 - I'm Linda.

42
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:04,847
 - Great, now you've forced
 me to know your name, Linda.

43
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:06,055
 Are you happy?

44
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:09,817
 - Wow... uh.

45
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,789
I was just trying to be polite.

46
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:27,145
 I mean, we do live in the
 same apartment building.

47
00:06:28,318 --> 00:06:29,492
 - Sorry if I seem
 a little harsh.

48
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:30,769
 I'm having a hard day.

49
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:32,875
- Ah, yeah, well, join the club.

50
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,532
 - I don't see you in traction.

51
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:37,258
Your pain must be on the inside.

52
00:06:59,142 --> 00:07:03,526
 I guess for a first date,
 it's not too bad, huh?

53
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:08,462
 - Being my neighbor, you
 must know I have a boyfriend,

54
00:07:08,497 --> 00:07:10,395
a very large boyfriend.

55
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:12,259
 - Well, I've never met him.

56
00:07:12,293 --> 00:07:13,605
I've only ever had the
pleasure of hearing him

57
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,849
 throw you against the wall.

58
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:22,545
PlayStation doesn't cry, Linda!

59
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:31,036
 - Yeah, well, I'm not the
 one with the black eye.

60
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,937
 - Yeah, you should
 see the other guys.

61
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:38,285
 By the way, Linda, did I
 mention you're awfully nosy?

62
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,806
- I'm not the one eavesdropping
on people's apartments.

63
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,463
- Well, I don't exactly
have to hold a glass

64
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,672
 up against the wall to
 hear well, what's his name,

65
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:47,984
 Dumbfuck, kicking your ass.

66
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:51,229
- His name is Kyle, and
he doesn't kick my ass.

67
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:54,991
 Half the time you're probably
 hearing me throw shit.

68
00:07:55,026 --> 00:07:57,373
 I tend to break
 things when I'm angry.

69
00:07:57,407 --> 00:07:58,408
 - Ooh, whoa.

70
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:06,416
 - So, since we're prying into
 each other's personal lives,

71
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:09,799
 I gotta know what
 happened to your eye.

72
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:13,044
 - Why?

73
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:15,046
- Just curious.

74
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,703
 I know I've only known
 you for a wash cycle

75
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:18,912
 and I already wanna
 punch you in the face.

76
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:19,775
 - Hmm.

77
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:24,918
 Yeah, my work is
 hazardous, it's messy.

78
00:08:24,952 --> 00:08:27,161
 - What do you do?

79
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:28,611
 Extreme painting?

80
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:32,028
 - What are you talking about?

81
00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:34,134
 - You're wearing
 a painter's suit.

82
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:36,067
 I mean, you must be a painter.

83
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:37,586
 - It's laundry day.

84
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,794
You're wearing a chicken shirt.

85
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:41,313
 What does that
 mean, you lay eggs?

86
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:44,696
 This is a McConville jumpsuit.

87
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:47,596
 It's industrial durability,
 cellulose based,

88
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,667
 and on a molecular level,
 the hydrogen bonding--

89
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:50,875
 - Huh, hydro what?

90
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:52,773
 - Shh, it's odor free,
 it's wrinkle free,

91
00:08:52,808 --> 00:08:56,087
 and with minimal
 Scotchgard, stain resistant.

92
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:59,055
 I never bother with
 the Scotchgard.

93
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:03,922
- So if
 you're not a painter,

94
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:07,270
 then why are you so
 worried about stains?

95
00:09:07,305 --> 00:09:09,203
 - We're all worried
 about stains, Linda.

96
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:10,653
 This is a laundromat.

97
00:09:10,688 --> 00:09:12,379
 We're not here at the crack
 of dawn to make friends,

98
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:14,554
 or take a steam bath, are we?

99
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,728
 It's all about the stains.

100
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:23,701
 - So you must just
 have a messy job

101
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:25,047
 that doesn't involve paint.

102
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:27,359
 - Look, it's not important.

103
00:09:27,394 --> 00:09:28,913
 Okay, it's like ping-pong,

104
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:31,709
 or dressing up in
 women's clothing.

105
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:34,297
 I don't play
 ping-pong, by the way.

106
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:36,127
- You're fucking crazy.

107
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:38,508
 - Oh yeah, you have no idea.

108
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:44,135
 So Linda, who snorts
 when she laughs,

109
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:45,964
has a dumb fuck for a boyfriend

110
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:48,104
 and bullies strangers
 into conversations.

111
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:50,141
Do you like to eat food?

112
00:09:52,661 --> 00:09:54,076
- Occasionally.

113
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,734
- Oh, God, no, we might actually
have something in common.

114
00:09:56,768 --> 00:09:58,459
 - Technically, yeah.

115
00:09:59,495 --> 00:10:00,669
 - So you wanna get some food

116
00:10:00,703 --> 00:10:02,843
 after you finish
 folding my stuff?

117
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:03,810
 - Go to hell.

118
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:06,191
 - Whoa, shh, language.

119
00:10:06,226 --> 00:10:08,469
There might be people that
actually speak English in here.

120
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:09,643
 Lunch, please?

121
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:11,990
 - Lunch with you?

122
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:14,303
 - Duh.

123
00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:17,962
- Oh, oh,

124
00:10:17,996 --> 00:10:20,378
I'm sorry, I just think
I might have a problem

125
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,069
 holding my food down
 while staring at you

126
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:24,554
 from across a table.

127
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:27,281
- I'm nicer than your boyfriend.

128
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:30,733
 - Yeah, well, everybody's
 nicer than my boyfriend,

129
00:10:30,768 --> 00:10:33,115
 which is why I'm doing
 laundry at the crack of dawn

130
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:35,324
 to avoid going home to my,

131
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:38,603
 my dumb fuck.

132
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,848
 - Ha, well, let's
 not go home together.

133
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,368
 - Oh yeah, right.

134
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:48,924
 - I get it.

135
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,753
- You get what?

136
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:54,205
- Yeah, you're chicken,
no pun intended.

137
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:55,171
 - I'm chicken?

138
00:10:55,206 --> 00:10:56,621
 - Yeah.
 - I'm chicken?

139
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,003
 Oh, like I'm scared
 of something?

140
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:00,487
- Yeah.

141
00:11:00,521 --> 00:11:02,523
 - What might that be?

142
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:03,732
- I don't know.

143
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:05,837
Hot young girl,

144
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:08,737
 big bad wolf,

145
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,843
 did I mention you're hot?

146
00:11:11,878 --> 00:11:13,638
 - Thank you.

147
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,227
Look, don't worry about
me, I can handle myself.

148
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:17,538
I'm a big girl.

149
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:20,818
But you, a big bad wolf?

150
00:11:22,612 --> 00:11:25,754
 I don't know, no offense,
 I just kinda see you

151
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:28,826
 more like a sheep
 in wolf's clothing.

152
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,897
 - Look, all I'm saying
 is I could understand

153
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:33,796
 why you wouldn't go to lunch
 with a complete stranger,

154
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:36,730
 but thanks for the demeaning
 characterization anyway.

155
00:11:36,765 --> 00:11:39,215
- Oh, gee, I'm so sorry.

156
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,527
- I'm starving.

157
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,531
There's a vending machine there.

158
00:11:45,877 --> 00:11:49,985
 - I suppose we could go
 somewhere public and well lit

159
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:53,298
with plastic utensils
and clear escape routes.

160
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,610
 - Oh, yeah?

161
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:56,405
 I'm just saying we
 can hang out here

162
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:59,649
 and breathe this dryer
 lint in hellhole,

163
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:02,929
or we can walk 100 feet
and hang out in Bangkok.

164
00:12:02,963 --> 00:12:04,206
It's your call.

165
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:10,868
 - I've always wanted
 to go to Bangkok.

166
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,024
 - It's weird, huh?

167
00:12:30,473 --> 00:12:31,302
I mean,

168
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:33,062
 my power.

169
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:36,100
- Oh, it must be a supernatural

170
00:12:36,134 --> 00:12:38,205
 'cause it ain't your charm,
 that's for goddamn sure.

171
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,484
 - Don't be so obvious, is
 she looking over here, baby?

172
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,107
- No, she doesn't
 even know we're alive.

173
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:44,453
 Would you like me to signal?

174
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:46,144
- Mm-hm.

175
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:48,215
- Did you call me baby?

176
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,252
- Just chill out, watch.

177
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:54,049
 - You're serious.
 - Watch.

178
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:01,815
 - You want to order something?

179
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,300
 - Yes, we'll have two beers,

180
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:05,819
 she'll have the
 Thai spring rolls,

181
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:07,510
 and I'll have the
 pad siew, please.

182
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:08,822
- Ka.

183
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:12,412
- How the hell did you do that?

184
00:13:12,446 --> 00:13:15,242
 And how'd you know
 what I wanted to eat?

185
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:16,381
 - I told you,

186
00:13:18,142 --> 00:13:19,143
 I'm magical.

187
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:22,249
 Or maybe...

188
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:33,157
 - You've got quite
 an imagination there.

189
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:35,745
 Is this a hobby, you write?

190
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,782
- No, I'm a storyteller.

191
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,578
 Now if you're lucky,
 you might make it

192
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,305
into one of my stories,
but you'd be naked.

193
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:44,168
 - Honored.

194
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:46,653
 Are you any good?

195
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:49,759
 - Oh, I don't know.

196
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,798
 - Come on, why don't you
 just tell me a story, then?

197
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,144
- Don't mock me.

198
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:57,940
 - Look, it's been real but,

199
00:13:57,975 --> 00:14:01,495
 I've kinda got some
 panties to fold.

200
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,844
 - All right, I'll
 tell you a story.

201
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,572
- Would it
 kill someone to come

202
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:11,367
 in this kitchen and help me?

203
00:14:11,402 --> 00:14:14,577
 I oughta poison
 all you ingrates!

204
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:19,651
- Stay put,

205
00:14:19,686 --> 00:14:21,688
there's knives in there.

206
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:26,762
- Very hot plate.

207
00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:28,315
 - Thanks.

208
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,524
 So, where's this story going?

209
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:33,562
 - Well, give me a
 minute, ADD, geez.

210
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:42,743
 - Can someone come into
 this kitchen and help me?

211
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:44,987
 I oughta poison
 all you ingrates!

212
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:46,851
 I don't know why I bother!

213
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,818
 Here ya go, piggies!

214
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:50,682
 Oh, whores, bastards!

215
00:14:50,717 --> 00:14:52,339
 Look at the mess you made!

216
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:54,031
 More work for Mommy!

217
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:56,619
Ah, this spoon is singing to me!

218
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:01,348
- Mommy?
- Stop.

219
00:15:01,383 --> 00:15:02,591
 - Mommy, did you remember

220
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,627
 to take your special
 medication today?

221
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:06,250
- I made your favorite,

222
00:15:06,284 --> 00:15:10,116
 wormies with
 marinada-nada-nada sauce.

223
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,566
 It's tomato, don't ya know?

224
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:15,500
 - Oh, great sauce,
 honey, great sauce.

225
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:20,402
- Ain't no honey in that sauce,
only tomato, only tomato!

226
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,231
- Only tomato, only tomato,

227
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:25,062
only tomato, that's all we got.

228
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:25,925
 - You!

229
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,410
 - It's not his fault.

230
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:31,758
 - It's always gonna
 be you, it's only you!

231
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:34,174
 - Don't, don't you touch him.

232
00:15:36,556 --> 00:15:40,146
 - They won't be around
 forever to save you.

233
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,596
 Just you wait, just you wait.

234
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:54,677
 - It just seems a little tame,

235
00:15:54,712 --> 00:15:57,887
 dysfunctional family
 with a loony mom.

236
00:15:58,923 --> 00:16:00,545
 - Wow.

237
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,099
 Now, I would've
 guessed pole dancer,

238
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:04,204
 but literary critic,
 that's amazing.

239
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,861
 - Don't get bent outta shape.

240
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:07,483
I was just saying that--

241
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:09,175
 - I wasn't finished.

242
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:35,399
- Creepy,
 I'll give ya that.

243
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:38,091
 - How generous of you.

244
00:17:38,126 --> 00:17:40,714
 - It just still seems a
 little tame compared to you.

245
00:17:40,749 --> 00:17:41,646
- You know what?

246
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:43,683
Fuck off, you try and do better.

247
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:44,925
- You know what?

248
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,514
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
you're right, I'm just,

249
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:49,654
I'm in a really foul mood today.

250
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:52,105
 I was supposed to be
 at a friend's birthday
 party last night

251
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,589
 and it's like up in the woods,

252
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:55,488
 it's at this really cool cabin

253
00:17:55,522 --> 00:17:59,181
and my best friends are up
there and my sister's up there.

254
00:17:59,216 --> 00:18:00,734
- So?

255
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:03,116
 - So at the last minute,
 Kyle decides he's gotta watch

256
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:06,154
some college ballgame
and refuses to take me.

257
00:18:06,188 --> 00:18:08,535
 - So why didn't you just
 ditch him and go yourself?

258
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,365
 - Because my car's a beater

259
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:13,057
 and Kyle wouldn't loan me
 his car to drive up there.

260
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,370
 'Cause he's a selfish asshole.

261
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:17,234
 - That's a nice story.

262
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:21,514
 - I just think it's
 pretty lame that,

263
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:25,000
 I'm not sitting with
 my toes in a lake.

264
00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:27,106
 - So you missed your party.

265
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,764
 Still no excuse to take it
 out on your new boyfriend.

266
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,733
 - I wasn't, and you're not.

267
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:36,391
 It's just that your story was

268
00:18:36,425 --> 00:18:38,910
 not what I was expecting.

269
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:43,432
I guess I was expecting
something a little
more horrific.

270
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:46,711
- Oh, you like horrific, do you?

271
00:18:46,746 --> 00:18:47,747
 - Sometimes.

272
00:18:51,337 --> 00:18:53,062
 - Here's one.

273
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:20,814
- Need more fish sauce.

274
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:34,587
 - Thanks, but for some reason,

275
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:35,864
 making me into a killer hasn't

276
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:37,348
 really cheered me
 up all that much.

277
00:19:37,383 --> 00:19:39,143
 Hm, go figure.

278
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,179
 - Hm.

279
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,110
 - Hm, what?

280
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,286
 - How 'bout I make
 a story for you

281
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:46,599
 about the party you missed.

282
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:54,814
 Custom made, I'll just
 need a little background.

283
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:55,849
 - Like what?

284
00:19:57,057 --> 00:19:59,163
 - Like for starters,
 where's this cabin?

285
00:19:59,198 --> 00:19:59,991
 - Big Bear.

286
00:20:00,026 --> 00:20:00,820
 - Isolated?

287
00:20:00,854 --> 00:20:01,648
- Very.

288
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:03,029
 - How many guests?

289
00:20:03,063 --> 00:20:05,928
 - Ooh, uh, Frank, Amy, Ken,

290
00:20:05,963 --> 00:20:07,378
 Roy, John, Jenny,

291
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:13,384
 I know I'm forgetting
 somebody, oh, uh...

292
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:16,111
 Patricia, Pat, my sister.

293
00:20:16,145 --> 00:20:18,251
 - Okay, which one is
 it, Patricia or Pat?

294
00:20:18,286 --> 00:20:19,666
 - Is Pat.

295
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:21,254
 - 'Kay, that's
 it, there's seven?

296
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:22,324
 - Yeah, I think so.

297
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,670
 - Who's birthday?

298
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:27,018
 - Frank's and am I
 telling the story, or?

299
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:27,881
- Fine.

300
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:34,647
- What?

301
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:35,889
- They're not gonna do

302
00:20:35,924 --> 00:20:37,270
 the whole surprise
 thing, are they?

303
00:20:37,305 --> 00:20:38,616
- You love this stuff,

304
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:39,548
 you're like an
 attention whore, go!

305
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,618
- You
 just, you go first.

306
00:20:40,653 --> 00:20:42,310
- Nope.

307
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:09,198
- What?

308
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:12,167
 - First of all, my
 sister's nothing like me.

309
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:15,135
 She's not a blonde, she's
 a brunette, no glasses.

310
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,655
 - Okay, I should have figured
 you were one of a kind.

311
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,450
- And you have Frank all wrong.

312
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:22,453
 Although, he does
 have tons of tattoos,

313
00:21:22,488 --> 00:21:23,627
his hair's kind of long

314
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:25,870
 and he's way too
 cool to drive an SUV.

315
00:21:25,905 --> 00:21:28,804
Oh, and there's just a--
- No, that's enough.

316
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,289
 - Well, I just think
 that you should--

317
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:33,947
 - No, listen, am I telling
 the story or are you?

318
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:38,435
- They're not gonna

319
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:40,851
 do the whole surprise
 thing, are they?

320
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:41,921
- You love this stuff,

321
00:21:41,955 --> 00:21:44,510
you're like an attention whore.

322
00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:33,559
- Wow, what a
reception, I'm touched.

323
00:22:35,043 --> 00:22:37,356
 You guys stoned already, or?

324
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,256
- Happy Birthday!

325
00:23:00,206 --> 00:23:01,656
 - Roy, Roy, do me a
 favor, keep it real,

326
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,554
 you just keep it
 real, this one time,

327
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:06,246
once in your life, keep it real.

328
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:07,662
- How's this
 for keepin' it real?

329
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:10,216
- Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh!

330
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,493
- Oh, no, oh, no!

331
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:14,910
 - She touched it.

332
00:23:14,945 --> 00:23:16,015
 - Oh!
 - You touched it.

333
00:23:18,086 --> 00:23:20,468
 - If you're not wearing
 underwear, say hooty-hoo!

334
00:23:20,502 --> 00:23:25,024
- I'm wearing underwear.

335
00:23:25,058 --> 00:23:26,232
- All right, let's go.

336
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:28,268
- Does that
 mean we're not gonna--

337
00:23:28,303 --> 00:23:30,443
 - This is something
 for Frank especially.

338
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:31,962
- I want one too.

339
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:35,828
 - All everyone was expecting
 cabin and rocks, right?

340
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:37,450
 - There's nothing
 sweet about that.

341
00:23:37,485 --> 00:23:38,693
 - Can I use your
 light again, man?

342
00:23:38,727 --> 00:23:39,556
 - Hm?

343
00:23:40,522 --> 00:23:42,351
 Man, I love you guys.

344
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:45,009
 - Aw, it's cute,
 love you too but,

345
00:23:45,044 --> 00:23:48,185
you can go to hell because what
I really love is this cabin.

346
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,462
- Yeah!
- Right?

347
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,120
 - Yay!

348
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:57,159
- Oh, congratulation!

349
00:23:57,194 --> 00:23:58,437
Oh, I know you.

350
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:02,337
 You come here some time
 with a big, handsome man.

351
00:24:02,371 --> 00:24:03,925
 - Oh, she means Dumbfuck.

352
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,340
 - Dumbfuck?

353
00:24:05,374 --> 00:24:06,790
 What's that mean?

354
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:11,864
So nasty.

355
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:20,631
 - Oh my God, now I really
 wish I was at that cabin.

356
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,391
 - Oh, that'll change,
 just gimme some time.

357
00:24:22,426 --> 00:24:24,842
- Ooh, I'm shakin' in my boots.

358
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:27,224
 It's all been very
 horrific so far.

359
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,570
- Well, gimme a minute,

360
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:30,399
 I gotta set up the
 freakin' characters, right?

361
00:24:30,434 --> 00:24:31,573
 - Yeah, you should
 just calm down though,

362
00:24:31,608 --> 00:24:33,472
 I mean, you're so worked up.

363
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:35,266
 - Yeah but you, you
 really piss me off,

364
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:37,165
 you know that, don't you?

365
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:38,028
Kiss me.

366
00:24:42,446 --> 00:24:44,966
I'll take it out
on your friends.

367
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,002
- Are we skinny dipping today?

368
00:24:47,037 --> 00:24:50,730
 - Aw, skinny dipping,
 really, with the nude?

369
00:24:50,765 --> 00:24:52,007
 How hippy.

370
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:53,284
 - Come on, boy,
 live a little, man.

371
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,216
 - Ahh!
 - I know,

372
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:56,253
 you could use some sun, baby.

373
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,117
 - Yeah, show it, SBBD.

374
00:24:59,014 --> 00:25:00,982
 - Ahh!
 - SB, SB what?

375
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:03,260
What?

376
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:04,537
 - Skinny Boy Big Dick.

377
00:25:05,883 --> 00:25:08,403
 - Shut up, it's not that big.

378
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:09,611
- You know what?

379
00:25:09,646 --> 00:25:11,164
 I think I'm gonna wear my
 bathing suit after all.

380
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:13,546
- Hey, don't let
Anaconda intimidate you,

381
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:14,789
Johnny, you got points.

382
00:25:14,823 --> 00:25:16,998
- Ah-ha-ha-ha, suck it.

383
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:18,586
- Let's swim, shall we?

384
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,519
 - I'm sorry, I just can't
 keep my hands off this guy.

385
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:22,382
 Come here, hey, come here!
 - Ah, no, stop, man!

386
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:24,626
 - Take it, take it, take it.
 - I've got a rash on my neck.

387
00:25:24,661 --> 00:25:25,972
 - Ow, all right, all right!

388
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:28,147
All right, I'm done,
I'm done, ow, ow, okay.

389
00:25:28,181 --> 00:25:29,079
 - See that?

390
00:25:30,356 --> 00:25:33,911
 Brute force is no
 match for physics.

391
00:25:33,946 --> 00:25:36,327
- Physics nothing, more like
ball-grabbing, you pole smoker.

392
00:25:36,362 --> 00:25:38,985
- Oh, I see, so he beat
you in a fair fight

393
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,539
 and you gotta call him gay?

394
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:43,334
 - Uh, no, he grabbed my nuts
 is why I called him gay.

395
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:46,372
 And besides, look how pretty
 he is, huh, ya see that?

396
00:25:46,406 --> 00:25:48,581
 - He's got you there,
 Roy, you are pretty.

397
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:52,033
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm, I know, I know,

398
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,966
I'm pretty like a girl.

399
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:57,694
I can't help it, I'm sick of it.

400
00:25:57,728 --> 00:26:00,973
 Girls just wanna dress me
 up like a little sister

401
00:26:01,007 --> 00:26:02,733
 and guys either
 wanna beat me up,

402
00:26:02,768 --> 00:26:04,666
or get me to blow them.

403
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:05,874
 - Oh, oh!

404
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:08,946
- Well, come on, Christ!
- Whoa, Roy!

405
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:11,673
Honey, settle down a little bit.

406
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:13,226
 We're just windin' ya up.

407
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:14,883
 Just windin' ya up.

408
00:26:14,918 --> 00:26:18,128
 - I know, I'm just
 messing with you guys.

409
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:20,440
- Okay.

410
00:26:20,475 --> 00:26:22,442
 - Can I just say how bummed
 I am that Linda's not here.

411
00:26:22,477 --> 00:26:23,996
 - Pretty weak.

412
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,929
 - Yeah, she should be here.

413
00:26:25,963 --> 00:26:27,620
 - Okay, no, I don't wanna
 talk about it, all right?

414
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:29,967
It really irks me, and
her dumb fuck boyfriend.

415
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:32,176
- Dumb fuck, dumb fuck.
- Dumb fuck.

416
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:34,178
Dumb fuck, dumb fuck.

417
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:35,628
 - Nice touch.

418
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:38,527
 - Dumb fuck, dumb fuck.
 - Hey, hey, let's go swimming!

419
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:40,529
Last one in is Roy!

420
00:26:40,564 --> 00:26:41,807
 - Oh, oh, oh, oh,
 oh, shit, shit,

421
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:43,360
 I forgot my music.
 - Go to hell.

422
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,500
 - I'm gonna run back, get
 my boombox, be right back.

423
00:26:45,534 --> 00:26:48,917
 - Now, help me design
 our perfect maniac.

424
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:51,506
 - How's that?

425
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,611
 - Well, like,

426
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:56,269
 what should our
 psycho look like?

427
00:26:56,304 --> 00:26:58,099
 - Probably like you?

428
00:26:58,133 --> 00:26:58,962
- Nice.

429
00:27:06,452 --> 00:27:08,281
 - Anyways, he should
 probably have one

430
00:27:08,316 --> 00:27:11,043
 of your creepy
 macaroni suits on.

431
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:14,218
 - It's a McConville.

432
00:27:14,253 --> 00:27:17,463
 And how do we even
 know the guy's a he?

433
00:27:21,812 --> 00:27:25,264
 - Oh, come on, get
 real, he's a he.

434
00:27:25,298 --> 00:27:26,921
 - Okay, what's he look like?

435
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:30,476
 - Like, is he wearing
 a mask or something?

436
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,926
 - Yeah, whatever.

437
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:37,345
- Hm, maybe it's just
like black face makeup.

438
00:27:39,554 --> 00:27:41,798
 - No, not blackface makeup,

439
00:27:41,832 --> 00:27:44,835
 I meant like just
 black face makeup.

440
00:27:46,595 --> 00:27:49,460
- That's too predictable,
let's think of household items.

441
00:27:51,324 --> 00:27:52,671
 Very funny.

442
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:54,155
 - I'm sorry!

443
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:57,814
 Okay, so let's just put
 a kid's mask on him then.

444
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,853
- Wow, that's original.

445
00:28:03,923 --> 00:28:05,338
 - Well, fuck you.

446
00:28:07,858 --> 00:28:10,585
 - Why doesn't he just pull a
 nylon stocking over his head?

447
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:12,552
 - Sure, I mean, just
 'cause it's cliche

448
00:28:12,587 --> 00:28:14,347
doesn't mean it can't be creepy.

449
00:28:14,382 --> 00:28:15,245
 - Okay, so,

450
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:18,558
 we'll all some barbed wire.

451
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,667
 - All right, I like where
 you're going with this.

452
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,875
- Yeah?

453
00:28:27,257 --> 00:28:29,259
 It's dramatic, but
 it's not believable.

454
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:31,744
He'd be shedding crayon
crumbs everywhere.

455
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:34,195
 - Yeah, you're
 probably right, so,

456
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:36,749
 you just wanna stick
 to the ski mask?

457
00:28:36,784 --> 00:28:38,544
 - I'll give you that.

458
00:28:38,578 --> 00:28:40,063
 But how 'bout we compromise?

459
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,243
- That is really creepy.

460
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:49,900
 - So we're good to go?

461
00:28:49,935 --> 00:28:51,350
 - No.

462
00:28:51,384 --> 00:28:53,386
I want a pink tool belt.

463
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:54,318
 - Get out.

464
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:57,045
 - I mean, it's just a story,

465
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,323
 so I want a pink tool belt.

466
00:29:00,428 --> 00:29:02,361
 - You're serious?

467
00:29:02,395 --> 00:29:03,224
- Yeah.

468
00:29:06,814 --> 00:29:08,401
 Oh, come on!

469
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:13,786
- I can see why he would bring--

470
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:15,339
- Why did I leave
my gold earring here?

471
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:22,519
 - Don't, don't do this to me.

472
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:23,934
 Now you see that?

473
00:29:23,969 --> 00:29:28,180
I don't need you, Mr.
Cable, I have batteries.

474
00:29:28,214 --> 00:29:30,734
 You're no match
 for me, it's cool.

475
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,805
Stings, does it?

476
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,082
 All right, what's up, holla!

477
00:29:34,117 --> 00:29:36,119

 - No, what kind of brain
 comes up with shit like that?

491
00:30:11,982 --> 00:30:13,708
 - You're such a poser.

492
00:30:13,742 --> 00:30:14,985
 - Me?

493
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,711
 - Yeah, you try to act all
 hardcore but you're really,

494
00:30:16,745 --> 00:30:18,230
 you're just a girl.

495
00:30:18,264 --> 00:30:19,748
 - Well, I am, and the people

496
00:30:19,783 --> 00:30:22,199
that you're slaughtering
happen to be my friends.

497
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:23,822
- It's a story.

498
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:25,754
 Besides, I wouldn't
 think that you would mind

499
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:28,792
 considering they're all up
 there partying without you.

500
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,725
Shit, you said they
haven't even called you.

501
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:34,211
 - There's probably
 no cell reception.

502
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:35,419
 - Yeah, right.

503
00:30:39,665 --> 00:30:42,012
 - Death is too good for them.

504
00:30:42,047 --> 00:30:43,738
 - That's the spirit.

505
00:30:52,989 --> 00:30:54,611
 What?

506
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:56,993
 What are you doing,
 it's not finished yet.

507
00:30:57,027 --> 00:31:00,203
 - Oh, listen, I'd love to
 spend all day listening

508
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:04,138
 to your perverted fantasies,
 but I gotta get goin'.

509
00:31:04,172 --> 00:31:04,966
- What?

510
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:06,934
 Oh, right,

511
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,662
 yeah, Prince Charming
 is waiting for you.

512
00:31:11,697 --> 00:31:14,803
 - So we ate some noodles while
 you slaughtered my friends.

513
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:17,634
 Doesn't make us best
 friends forever.

514
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:20,050
 - I didn't force you
 to have lunch with me.

515
00:31:20,085 --> 00:31:21,776
 - Whatever.

516
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,882
 - No, I'm not buying this.

517
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,919
 You approached me
 in the laundromat.

518
00:31:26,954 --> 00:31:31,061
 I didn't even wanna talk
 to you but you persisted.

519
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:34,133
 And I think you
 like me in that way.

520
00:31:34,168 --> 00:31:35,410
- Oh, dream on.

521
00:31:36,964 --> 00:31:38,724
 What is your point?

522
00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:39,656
 - My point?

523
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:45,041
My point is you can't
treat me like a novelty.

524
00:31:45,075 --> 00:31:49,010
 This guy, Kyle, he's
 a hobby, I'm for real.

525
00:31:49,045 --> 00:31:51,944
 - No, you're full of shit.

526
00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:53,739
 And you don't know
 anything about me.

527
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:55,879
 - I know you better
 than you think.

528
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,260
 Your voice, it
 penetrates the drywall

529
00:31:57,294 --> 00:31:59,331
of my apartment like a chainsaw.

530
00:31:59,365 --> 00:32:00,919
 - And nobody asked
 you to listen.

531
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:02,955
 - No, you never asked
 me, you insisted

532
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,681
 with your incessant yelling,

533
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:08,064
 and your nagging,
 and your crying.

534
00:32:08,098 --> 00:32:09,824
 But you're still hot.

535
00:32:11,446 --> 00:32:13,414
- Regardless, thank you,

536
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:16,451
 for a really lovely lunch.

537
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,766
 - Well, in lieu
 of dessert, Linda,

538
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,423
 why don't you chew on this?

539
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:24,873
 Everything else aside, had
 you really wanted to make

540
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:29,050
that birthday party, you
would have been there.

541
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:51,590
 Hey.

542
00:32:54,662 --> 00:32:57,389
- I'm sorry I bailed back there.

543
00:32:57,423 --> 00:32:58,769
It's been a day.

544
00:32:59,874 --> 00:33:01,289
- I just figured you were trying

545
00:33:01,324 --> 00:33:03,257
 to get out of paying
 for the check.

546
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:07,192
 - Oh, shit, no, oh,
 God, no, I'm sorry.

547
00:33:07,226 --> 00:33:10,298
 - It's cool, it's
 cool, I handled it.

548
00:33:11,644 --> 00:33:14,233
 Let's just say you owe me one.

549
00:33:14,268 --> 00:33:15,994
 - Okay, are you sure?

550
00:33:17,202 --> 00:33:18,030
- Yeah.

551
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,863
 - Listen, I didn't realize you
 could hear so much at home.

552
00:33:23,898 --> 00:33:24,726
- A lot.

553
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,110
- Well, let's hope not too much.

554
00:33:29,145 --> 00:33:31,250
 - More than I would like.

555
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:37,670
 Oh, you meant do I actually
 hear you two having sex?

556
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,295
 No, although I would
 welcome the sound

557
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:44,022
of you and Dumbfuck going at it.

558
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:47,749
 - Excuse me?

559
00:33:47,784 --> 00:33:49,165
 - Anything would be
 better than listening

560
00:33:49,199 --> 00:33:52,168
 to the two of you break plates
 over each other's heads.

561
00:33:52,202 --> 00:33:56,896
 Now, is screwing the only
 thing you do quietly, or?

562
00:33:56,931 --> 00:33:58,070
 Oh, I'm sorry.

563
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:02,523
 Sex has been a
 little scarce lately?

564
00:34:02,557 --> 00:34:03,834
I can fix that.

565
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:04,766
 - Watch it.

566
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:11,221
 - Are you gonna show me your
 impressive folding technique?

567
00:34:28,928 --> 00:34:33,657
 - Why on earth would I miss
 my friend's party on purpose?

568
00:34:33,692 --> 00:34:35,866
 - How would I know?

569
00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:37,144
 I was just suggesting that

570
00:34:37,178 --> 00:34:38,904
 if you really
 wanted to be there,

571
00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:40,388
 you would have been.

572
00:34:40,423 --> 00:34:43,702
 - Oh, come on, use
 your imagination.

573
00:34:43,736 --> 00:34:47,671
 I'm just asking you for
 one fucking simple reason.

574
00:34:47,706 --> 00:34:49,777
 - All right, I'll
 give you a couple.

575
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:52,607
 If you'd shown up
 there with Kyle,

576
00:34:52,642 --> 00:34:54,678
 the two of you would have
 fought the entire time,

577
00:34:54,713 --> 00:34:56,473
 effectively killing
 everyone's buzz.

578
00:34:56,508 --> 00:34:58,165
Now, had you gone alone,

579
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,719
 your friends would have
 railed on you the entire time

580
00:35:00,753 --> 00:35:02,548
 about dumping that loser.

581
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:03,756
 All I can say is this,

582
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:06,104
 I haven't lied to you.

583
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:07,691
 I make stuff up in my stories

584
00:35:07,726 --> 00:35:10,073
 but I'm telling you
 the truth right now.

585
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,594
That boyfriend of
yours, he's dead weight.

586
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:17,701
- Do you actually think
if I wasn't with Kyle,

587
00:35:17,736 --> 00:35:20,325
you and I would stand a chance?

588
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:23,086
 - Oh, Linda,

589
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:28,436
 I wish this was about us.

590
00:35:28,471 --> 00:35:33,061
 But it's not, it's about you
 and your crappy boyfriend.

591
00:35:35,995 --> 00:35:37,549
- Shit!

592
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:39,309
 Yeah, I know, I know!

593
00:35:40,379 --> 00:35:42,243
This isn't easy for me.

594
00:35:42,278 --> 00:35:43,555
 - Sure it is.

595
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:45,419
 - No, Aaron, it's not.

596
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:47,214
- Linda,

597
00:35:50,182 --> 00:35:51,321
 I have vision.

598
00:35:52,495 --> 00:35:54,359
- Come on, 35, 35, we got this,

599
00:35:54,393 --> 00:35:56,395
we got this, let's go, let's go.

600
00:35:57,879 --> 00:35:59,191
Are you serious?

601
00:36:00,779 --> 00:36:03,506
It's two
more yards, you pussies!

602
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,334
 You gotta go--

603
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,069
 Oh, shit.

604
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:25,562
 - Too good, that's too good.

605
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:28,186
 - Nothing's too good for him.
 - Oh, stop,

606
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,981
 I don't know if I
 can take anymore.

607
00:36:31,016 --> 00:36:32,155
 - That's an interesting way

608
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,501
 of mourning the
 death of a loved one.

609
00:36:33,536 --> 00:36:35,054
- Oh, he can't be dead.

610
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:36,228
 - No?

611
00:36:36,263 --> 00:36:39,093
 - No, no, Kyle hasn't
 suffered enough.

612
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,855
 - It's your call.

613
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:48,378
- Down to 33.

614
00:36:56,144 --> 00:36:59,562
 - Oh, that's good,
 thank you for that.

615
00:36:59,596 --> 00:37:01,253
 - Glad I could help.

616
00:37:05,982 --> 00:37:08,053
 - You are taking forever.

617
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,230
 - I haven't perfected
 the technique.

618
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:14,680
 This comes so easy for you.

619
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:16,268
 - I think you're stalling.

620
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:17,476
- For what?

621
00:37:17,511 --> 00:37:18,408
 - I wonder.

622
00:37:20,203 --> 00:37:21,722
- You're a strange girl.

623
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:23,586
 - Finish your story.

624
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,139
 - What story?

625
00:37:25,173 --> 00:37:27,797
 - I get it, Kyle's a jerk.

626
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:29,177
 But hopefully he'll
 start to worry

627
00:37:29,212 --> 00:37:31,318
 if I don't come home soon.

628
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:32,284
- Worry?

629
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:34,286
 We just killed him.

630
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:35,494
- This.

631
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:39,015
- Yeah, one of us should
be born more often.

632
00:37:44,814 --> 00:37:46,781
 - Ew, get that slimy
 thing off of me.

633
00:37:46,816 --> 00:37:49,128
- Come on, you know you like it.

634
00:37:49,163 --> 00:37:51,890
 - I sense some more
 commentary coming.

635
00:37:51,924 --> 00:37:53,305
 - Oh, you've got it so wrong.

636
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,100
 I mean, Roy is a nerd.

637
00:37:55,134 --> 00:37:58,034
 He's sweet, but he's a nerd.

638
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:00,243
 - Even nerds do it, Linda.

639
00:38:01,555 --> 00:38:03,315
 - You don't know Roy.

640
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:05,559
- Stop.

641
00:38:05,593 --> 00:38:07,215
 Amy, Amy, Amy, don't
 get water in my ears.

642
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,769
 - Oh, "Don't get
 water in my ear."

643
00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:11,219
 - Seriously.
 - "Seriously!"

644
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:12,704
 - It's not funny, Amy.

645
00:38:12,738 --> 00:38:15,154
- "It's not funny, Amy."
 - Stop playing.

646
00:38:15,189 --> 00:38:16,121
- Aw!

647
00:38:16,155 --> 00:38:16,984
 - Aw!
 - Aw!

648
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:21,229
 - Hurricane splash!
 - Hey, that's for--

649
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:28,409
- Hurricane splash!

650
00:38:28,444 --> 00:38:29,790
 - Hey, that's for--

651
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:44,563
- This is the best
birthday present I've ever had.

652
00:38:44,598 --> 00:38:48,187
- Sorry I didn't
have time to wrap it.

653
00:38:48,222 --> 00:38:51,329
 - Your birthday
 suit'll do just fine.

654
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:19,357
- Stop it, shit, stop it!

655
00:39:32,991 --> 00:39:34,441
 - Did you hear that?

656
00:39:34,475 --> 00:39:35,580
 - Uh-huh.

657
00:39:39,825 --> 00:39:41,827
No doubt our little Roy.

658
00:39:45,003 --> 00:39:46,245
No, wait, wait.

659
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:49,387
 We can't have all the fun.

660
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:52,079
 Let's give our
 friend a little show.

661
00:39:52,113 --> 00:39:53,529
 - You are so bad.

662
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:56,083
 Mm, God, fuck yeah.

663
00:40:01,226 --> 00:40:04,540
- Ow, what the--
- Pig.

664
00:40:04,574 --> 00:40:07,128
- Ow, what did you do that for?

665
00:40:07,163 --> 00:40:09,165
- Shh.

666
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,062
 - Ow!

667
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:17,760
 - Who needs the internet?

668
00:40:28,633 --> 00:40:29,461
 - Oh, man!

669
00:40:47,893 --> 00:40:49,481
 I only came once.

670
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,453
Okay.

671
00:40:56,626 --> 00:40:59,905
 Come out, come out,
 whoever you are, Roy.

672
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:07,188
- Yup, as Roy's friend,

673
00:41:07,223 --> 00:41:10,813
I think it's only fair I
give him a little taste.

674
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:18,510
- You're kidding, right?

675
00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:22,721
 - Oh, sorry, did you
 wanna do the honors?

676
00:41:22,756 --> 00:41:26,242
 - No, no, thanks,
 I think I'll pass.

677
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:28,209
I will say that you are

678
00:41:29,107 --> 00:41:31,281
 one generous friend.

679
00:41:31,316 --> 00:41:34,250
- Me generous, um, have
you seen Roy's package?

680
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:37,218
 I mean, he'd be
 doing me the favor.

681
00:41:41,637 --> 00:41:42,638
 - All right.

682
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:47,021
Well,

683
00:41:47,056 --> 00:41:48,851
and with that, I think I'll just

684
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:51,992
cruise my way down to the lake.

685
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,307
 Okay.

686
00:42:00,379 --> 00:42:01,726
 Bye.

687
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,554
 - Bye.

688
00:42:11,494 --> 00:42:12,288
 Roy?

689
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:17,051
I got somethin' for ya.

690
00:42:21,677 --> 00:42:25,301
 Too late to be shy
 now, baby, come on.

691
00:42:34,172 --> 00:42:36,070
 - That is so sick.

692
00:42:36,105 --> 00:42:37,831
 - Yeah, but it's hot, right?

693
00:42:37,865 --> 00:42:38,970
 - Not really.

694
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:42,525
 - You're so jaded, you
 wouldn't even admit it

695
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,941
if it were the hottest
thing you'd ever heard.

696
00:42:44,976 --> 00:42:47,875
 - Okay, first of all,
 not that impressed,

697
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,601
 and isn't it kind of a cliche

698
00:42:49,636 --> 00:42:52,155
 to kill people for having sex?

699
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:54,986
 - No, it's not like that.

700
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:58,886
 - Oh, it's not, is it like
 old-school slasher style?

701
00:42:58,921 --> 00:43:01,406
Kids go into the woods,
tits come out, I mean,

702
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,305
 hockey masks and machetes
 can't be far behind.

703
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,928
 - Oh, please.

704
00:43:05,962 --> 00:43:07,723
 - A psychopath
 punishing young people

705
00:43:07,757 --> 00:43:09,310
for having a good time.

706
00:43:09,345 --> 00:43:12,072
 That is so tired
 and so derivative.

707
00:43:12,106 --> 00:43:14,799
 - Fuck off, think about it.

708
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:18,872
 In a social situation, like
 a party, or a camping trip,

709
00:43:18,906 --> 00:43:20,977
sex would be a time when couples

710
00:43:21,012 --> 00:43:22,634
separated from the herd, right?

711
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:23,946
 - Lame, if I remember,

712
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,190
your last scenario was
practically a threesome.

713
00:43:27,225 --> 00:43:29,607
 I mean, why does it
 always have to be sex?

714
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:31,091
 Someone can't like stumble

715
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:34,128
 into the woods to
 like, read a book?

716
00:43:35,233 --> 00:43:37,476
 - Well, you have
 friends that can read?

717
00:43:37,511 --> 00:43:40,894
- Funny, oh, and there's
just one small detail.

718
00:43:40,928 --> 00:43:42,067
 - Uh-huh?

719
00:43:42,102 --> 00:43:43,897
 - I know you worked extra hard

720
00:43:43,931 --> 00:43:46,624
 on the Frank-and-Jenny-humping
 scenario,

721
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:48,971
 but Frank happens to be gay.

722
00:43:51,939 --> 00:43:54,597
 - Oh, a small detail, huh?

723
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:57,531
 - I tried to tell
 you this earlier.

724
00:44:00,465 --> 00:44:02,398
- Okay, I'll try again.

725
00:44:03,157 --> 00:44:03,986
 - Roy?

726
00:44:05,366 --> 00:44:06,264
- Yeah.

727
00:44:06,298 --> 00:44:07,955
 - Oh my God, are you okay?

728
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:09,750
 - It's only 10 feet down.

729
00:44:09,785 --> 00:44:12,650
 Aw, man, it smells
 like poop in here.

730
00:44:14,721 --> 00:44:16,584
- Aw, shit.

731
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:18,000
- Oh my God.
- You all right?

732
00:44:18,034 --> 00:44:18,966
 Jenny, what are you doing?

733
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:21,175
 - Somebody pushed me!

734
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,936
Fuck!
- Hello?

735
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,317
 - Hello?
 - This isn't funny, come on.

736
00:44:25,352 --> 00:44:26,525
 - Disgusting.

737
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,218
 - Throw down a rope
 and pull us up.

738
00:44:30,391 --> 00:44:31,910
 I'll go up and then
 I'll pull you up.

739
00:44:31,945 --> 00:44:33,153
- All right.

740
00:44:33,187 --> 00:44:34,913
- Hold it, hold it, all
right, I'm comin' up.

741
00:44:39,918 --> 00:44:41,817
 All right, come on.

742
00:44:55,969 --> 00:44:57,280
- Funny.

743
00:44:57,315 --> 00:44:59,869
- I'm just tying up loose ends.

744
00:45:01,112 --> 00:45:02,354
 - Where's Jon?

745
00:45:04,115 --> 00:45:05,530
 He never made it to the lake.

746
00:45:05,564 --> 00:45:07,566
 - He's probably
 hiding somewhere.

747
00:45:07,601 --> 00:45:09,258
 He's probably waiting for
 us to stumble upon him

748
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:10,673
 so he can scare
 the shit out of us.

749
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,951
 - Well, he's gonna
 have a long wait.

750
00:45:12,986 --> 00:45:14,746
 - Probably stoned and
 up a tree somewhere.

751
00:45:14,781 --> 00:45:15,954
- He's definitely wasted

752
00:45:15,989 --> 00:45:17,438
 'cause he left his
 precious music behind.

753
00:45:17,473 --> 00:45:19,544
- Roy and Jenny are
nowhere in sight either.

754
00:45:19,578 --> 00:45:22,064
 - They'll be fine, believe me.

755
00:45:22,098 --> 00:45:25,067
- Are you sure Roy'll be
safe in Jenny's hands?

756
00:45:25,101 --> 00:45:26,896
 - Oh, I think he's in
 more than her hands.

757
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:28,346
- Oh!
- All right, guys,

758
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,624
let's not be rude about
our resident man-eater.

759
00:45:30,658 --> 00:45:33,523
- Roy and Jenny hooking
up, uh-uh, no way.

760
00:45:33,558 --> 00:45:35,008
 - Let's just put it this way,

761
00:45:35,042 --> 00:45:39,115
Jenny'll give Roy something
besides sci-fi to obsess about.

762
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,496
 - You're such a pig.

763
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,016
 - Our little Roy is
 boldly going where

764
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:45,743
 many men have gone before.

765
00:45:45,777 --> 00:45:48,676
 - Yes, exploring
 spectacular planets.

766
00:45:48,711 --> 00:45:50,782
 - Entering warp space.

767
00:45:50,817 --> 00:45:52,439
- Shut up.

768
00:45:52,473 --> 00:45:54,337
- He's being
 swallowed by a black hole.

769
00:45:54,372 --> 00:45:55,614
- Okay, really?

770
00:45:55,649 --> 00:45:59,618
Okay, you're just gross.
- Well I, okay.

771
00:45:59,653 --> 00:46:00,827
 - Where are you going?

772
00:46:00,861 --> 00:46:04,106
- Well, none of us
know how to make toast.

773
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,487
 So, I'm gonna go find Jon,

774
00:46:06,522 --> 00:46:07,972
pry him out of his tree,

775
00:46:08,006 --> 00:46:09,697
 and get him to rustle up
 some grub for the troops.

776
00:46:09,732 --> 00:46:12,390
- Oh, yes, please, I'm starving.

777
00:46:14,012 --> 00:46:16,359
- I can make toast.

778
00:46:16,394 --> 00:46:18,776
What are you doing, Miss Thang?

779
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,881
 - Let's get the damn
 candles on this thing.

780
00:46:20,916 --> 00:46:22,814
If Frank doesn't find Jon soon,

781
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:26,093
we're gonna have a red
velvet cake for dinner.

782
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,247
 - A lawn mower in a forest.

783
00:46:42,282 --> 00:46:46,044
Good luck.

784
00:47:01,232 --> 00:47:02,060
 Hello?

785
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,173
 Man, you scared the living--

786
00:47:11,207 --> 00:47:12,036
 - Shh.

787
00:47:13,658 --> 00:47:16,730
- Don't shush me, motherfucker.

788
00:47:16,764 --> 00:47:18,939
 I'll fuck you up.

789
00:47:18,974 --> 00:47:20,389
 Come on, come on.

790
00:47:23,357 --> 00:47:26,119
Thanks, but, not
really my thing.

791
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:31,400
You know, you're really starting

792
00:47:31,434 --> 00:47:33,989
 to piss me off, you know that?

793
00:47:45,552 --> 00:47:49,176
You know, I could break
free if I wanted to.

794
00:47:55,734 --> 00:47:57,529
Alright already.

795
00:47:57,564 --> 00:47:59,980
 It's not funny anymore, okay?

796
00:48:00,981 --> 00:48:04,122
 What do you want from me, huh?

797
00:48:04,157 --> 00:48:04,985
 Huh?

798
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:09,196
 All right, let me go now.

799
00:48:11,647 --> 00:48:13,649
 I'll do anything.

800
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:17,584
- Anything?

801
00:48:18,965 --> 00:48:19,793
 I want you.

802
00:48:23,245 --> 00:48:25,143
- I bet you do.

803
00:48:27,628 --> 00:48:29,251
- Mm, happy
 birthday, baby.

804
00:48:29,285 --> 00:48:30,459
 - Happy birthday--

805
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:38,639
- Gimme that.

806
00:48:40,848 --> 00:48:43,196
- I'm glad
 you came, Ken.

807
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:45,474
 Wait till I get my hands
 on you, you little slut--

808
00:48:46,889 --> 00:48:49,754
- Yep, you will have to wait

809
00:48:49,788 --> 00:48:51,790
to get your hands on me.

810
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,794
- Oh, yeah.

811
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:58,487
That's right, grab my, oh, fuck.

812
00:49:02,422 --> 00:49:04,079
 Oh, shit, Jon, fuck!

813
00:49:05,977 --> 00:49:08,428
 - Shit, Jon, this
 is a private party.

814
00:49:08,462 --> 00:49:10,119
You know, I appreciate
you dressing up and all.

815
00:49:10,154 --> 00:49:12,087
 And by the way, what are
 you doing with that nasty--

816
00:49:31,865 --> 00:49:32,693
 Wow.

817
00:49:34,143 --> 00:49:36,042
 That was killer, Jon.

818
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:40,770
 Now go be a stud and go make
 dinner, everybody's hungry.

819
00:49:42,565 --> 00:49:45,327
 Show's over,
 nothing to see here.

820
00:49:46,362 --> 00:49:47,812
 You're a bad boy.

821
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,397
- You guys
made this one too easy.

822
00:50:21,432 --> 00:50:22,709
- Motherfucker.

823
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:24,745
- Don't think
 this is happening

824
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,437
 because of your lifestyle.

825
00:50:26,471 --> 00:50:28,784
 I wish I could feel one
 way or the other about it.

826
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,027
 - Please--

827
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:31,200
- I wish I
 could feel anything.

828
00:50:42,936 --> 00:50:44,282
 - Ready, talk.

829
00:50:46,871 --> 00:50:48,597
 - Okay, you see this?

830
00:50:53,326 --> 00:50:55,293
 Look, see this, you
 see these girls?

831
00:50:55,328 --> 00:50:56,536
- Do you like--
- Pop it.

832
00:51:00,195 --> 00:51:03,198
- Ow, fuck!

833
00:51:03,232 --> 00:51:04,061
Ow, man.

834
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:06,822
 - Show me, show me.

835
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:08,996
 Whatcha got, whatcha
 got, whatcha got?

836
00:51:09,031 --> 00:51:12,897
- That's all I got.

837
00:51:18,351 --> 00:51:22,596
 Oh, God, that song must never
 see the light of day again.

838
00:51:22,631 --> 00:51:24,322
- We're never gonna see
the light of day again

839
00:51:24,357 --> 00:51:28,982
 unless we have someone come
 and feed us some real food.

840
00:51:32,537 --> 00:51:34,194
 - So it's been real.

841
00:51:35,506 --> 00:51:36,990
- I don't believe this.

842
00:51:37,024 --> 00:51:38,164
 Don't you wanna
 know how it ends?

843
00:51:38,198 --> 00:51:40,476
I'm one scene away from
finishing our story.

844
00:51:40,511 --> 00:51:42,202
 - Our story?

845
00:51:42,237 --> 00:51:44,239
I'm not taking
 credit for the pink tool belt.

846
00:51:46,586 --> 00:51:47,587
 - Ahh, well,

847
00:51:49,036 --> 00:51:52,523
 I'm pretty sure I'll
 be seeing you around.

848
00:51:54,076 --> 00:51:55,526
- Hey, you
 know where I live.

849
00:51:57,907 --> 00:51:58,701
- Yeah.

850
00:52:35,842 --> 00:52:39,673
Yeah, okay.

851
00:54:52,944 --> 00:54:53,807
 Uh--
 - Oh,

852
00:54:55,257 --> 00:54:58,087
 it's okay, I'll
 take a rain check.

853
00:54:59,054 --> 00:55:00,297
- Oh, uh, yeah.

854
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:35,677
 Fucking motherfucker.

855
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:01,496
 Fuck!

856
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,006
What an asshole.

857
00:56:29,903 --> 00:56:32,630
 - Hey, it was an accident.

858
00:56:32,665 --> 00:56:34,080
- What?

859
00:56:34,114 --> 00:56:37,635
 - Here, take it, got
 mixed up in my things.

860
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:39,119
 Innocent mistake.

861
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,675
 - I could fucking scream.

862
00:56:42,709 --> 00:56:44,849
 - Well, you just did.

863
00:56:44,884 --> 00:56:47,404
 It's paper thin, remember?

864
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:49,578
 - It's like, it's as if...

865
00:56:51,338 --> 00:56:54,445
 It's like Kyle fucking won't
 even let me go to the cabin

866
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,103
so he that he can stay
home and watch some game

867
00:56:57,137 --> 00:56:59,070
and then he just bails?

868
00:56:59,105 --> 00:57:00,727
 Like he'd just bailed?

869
00:57:00,762 --> 00:57:02,419
 - Are you surprised?

870
00:57:03,696 --> 00:57:05,801
 - I'm really sorry.

871
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:09,426
I don't mean to put
this on you, it's just,

872
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:13,982
I either harass you or I
trash my apartment more.

873
00:57:14,016 --> 00:57:16,087
 - Well, I don't
 wanna invite you in

874
00:57:16,122 --> 00:57:20,367
 because I don't want you
 to break any of my things.

875
00:57:23,129 --> 00:57:24,855
 - I'm really fed up.

876
00:57:24,889 --> 00:57:27,271
- Yeah, I can see that.

877
00:57:27,305 --> 00:57:28,445
 - I'm burning.

878
00:57:29,929 --> 00:57:34,243
 - Let's see, you don't
 strike me as the whiny type.

879
00:57:34,278 --> 00:57:37,557
 You're not a total ice
 princess either, so,

880
00:57:37,592 --> 00:57:40,318
 if I had to guess, I would say

881
00:57:40,353 --> 00:57:42,942
that you would opt for revenge.

882
00:57:44,702 --> 00:57:45,531
- Yeah.

883
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,086
 - I have the perfect thing.

884
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,328
- I'm listening.

885
00:57:50,363 --> 00:57:51,675
 - How long do you
 think it would take

886
00:57:51,709 --> 00:57:53,228
 to get to that cabin?

887
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:54,436
 - A few hours.

888
00:57:56,507 --> 00:57:57,439
 - Let's go.

889
00:57:59,786 --> 00:58:01,029
- You're crazy.

890
00:58:02,617 --> 00:58:05,171
 - I can finish
 telling you my story,

891
00:58:05,205 --> 00:58:07,242
 you can piss off Kyle,

892
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:09,934
I won't wear my creepy jumpsuit.

893
00:58:12,419 --> 00:58:14,801
 I'm just offering you a ride.

894
00:58:15,802 --> 00:58:18,149
 I'm not gonna ask you again.

895
00:58:19,703 --> 00:58:21,325
- Okay,

896
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,292
yeah, let's fucking go.

897
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,054
 - Yeah, great.

898
00:58:27,193 --> 00:58:29,851
I'll see you at the
car in like 10 minutes?

899
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:31,577
 - Are you sure about this, I--

900
00:58:31,611 --> 00:58:33,199
- Oh, yeah.

901
00:58:35,477 --> 00:58:36,305
- Okay.

902
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,586
 Take the jumpsuit off, please.

903
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:44,141
- Yeah.

904
01:00:26,864 --> 01:00:27,693
 Hello?

905
01:00:34,976 --> 01:00:36,909
Why do people say that?

906
01:00:36,943 --> 01:00:38,531
 - Because it's funny.

907
01:00:38,565 --> 01:00:39,774
 - I don't know,
 what do they mean,

908
01:00:39,808 --> 01:00:40,982
 like don't have a cow,

909
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:42,742
don't behave like you're
having a cow, what?

910
01:00:42,777 --> 01:00:44,744
 - You are a such a ponderer.

911
01:00:44,779 --> 01:00:46,677
 - These are important issues.

912
01:00:46,712 --> 01:00:48,299
- Who knows, it's like,

913
01:00:48,334 --> 01:00:50,888
 why do people say
 don't rub it in?

914
01:00:50,923 --> 01:00:52,234
 - I know that one.

915
01:00:52,269 --> 01:00:54,581
My great grandfather
told me that in his day,

916
01:00:54,616 --> 01:00:55,824
 people used to say,

917
01:00:55,859 --> 01:00:57,792
 you can shit on me,
 just don't rub it in.

918
01:00:57,826 --> 01:00:59,552
 - Oh, you know, I
 don't believe that,

919
01:00:59,586 --> 01:01:01,243
I think that's bullshit.

920
01:01:01,278 --> 01:01:02,762
- Why bullshit?

921
01:01:02,797 --> 01:01:04,833
 See, bullshit is
 just grass and grain.

922
01:01:04,868 --> 01:01:07,215
 - You what what the
 worst type of shit is?

923
01:01:07,249 --> 01:01:09,873
 It's human vegetarian shit.

924
01:01:09,907 --> 01:01:11,737
 See, I used to
 have this roommate

925
01:01:11,771 --> 01:01:13,911
 and all she would
 eat is spinach,

926
01:01:13,946 --> 01:01:17,328
and bran, and wheat grass shots.

927
01:01:17,363 --> 01:01:20,573
 I swear to God, it was rankest
 thing I've ever smelled.

928
01:01:20,607 --> 01:01:24,232
 It's kinda like a mossy
 swamp, rotten eggs, garlic--

929
01:01:24,266 --> 01:01:27,166
- Oh, okay, I get it, I
get it, that's enough.

930
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,892
I get it.

931
01:01:28,926 --> 01:01:31,135
 - Yeah, now who's hardcore?

932
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:43,630
 So, finish tell me the story.

933
01:01:43,665 --> 01:01:45,322
 - Oh, that old thing?

934
01:01:45,356 --> 01:01:47,876
- Yes, now.

935
01:01:47,911 --> 01:01:49,982
 - Well, don't have a cow.

936
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:06,032
 - I'm gonna be sick, I can't
 eat anymore of this cake, ugh.

937
01:02:08,448 --> 01:02:10,243
 - Shit, shit.

938
01:02:10,278 --> 01:02:13,108
 Shit, you know, this
 isn't funny anymore.

939
01:02:13,143 --> 01:02:15,110
 - It stopped being remotely
 funny about two hours

940
01:02:15,145 --> 01:02:17,285
 and an empty can
 of Cheez Whiz ago.

941
01:02:17,319 --> 01:02:20,115
 - Okay, something's wrong,
 something's happened.

942
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,668
- Okay, well, let's try
to keep it together.

943
01:02:21,703 --> 01:02:23,774
 Okay, how can something
 happen to five people at once?

944
01:02:23,809 --> 01:02:27,502
 - Okay, well, where
 are they then, huh?

945
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:28,814
 - Probably screwing,

946
01:02:28,848 --> 01:02:30,332
 I don't know.
 - We've been through this.

947
01:02:30,367 --> 01:02:33,577
 Frank and Ken can go at it all
 day and night, but Roy, Jon?

948
01:02:33,611 --> 01:02:36,373
No way, and even if
that miracle did occur,

949
01:02:36,407 --> 01:02:38,099
 with who, hm, Jen?

950
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:39,790
Yeah, pfft, never gonna happen.

951
01:02:39,825 --> 01:02:40,998
 - Uh, our Jen?

952
01:02:42,137 --> 01:02:43,552
 - Okay, fine, I'll
 give you that,

953
01:02:43,587 --> 01:02:44,968
Jen would nail anything on legs.

954
01:02:45,002 --> 01:02:46,210
 But it doesn't matter

955
01:02:46,245 --> 01:02:47,729
 because they should
 have been back by now.

956
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,111
 I mean, what, I give it
 like three minutes for Jon

957
01:02:50,145 --> 01:02:53,010
 and a 30-second out-of-body
 experience for Roy.

958
01:02:53,045 --> 01:02:54,460
 It's been three hours

959
01:02:54,494 --> 01:02:56,738
since we left the lake.
- Okay, whoa!

960
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,983
 Freaking out about it isn't
 gonna help anything, okay?

961
01:03:00,017 --> 01:03:03,503
 Breathe, let's just
 come up with a plan.

962
01:03:03,538 --> 01:03:04,815
 - A plan, Pat?

963
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:05,954
 You don't even know
 what's going on?

964
01:03:05,989 --> 01:03:07,542
 What do you wanna plan for?

965
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:10,648
 - Let's think of other
 possible scenarios.

966
01:03:10,683 --> 01:03:12,996
 - Oh, sure, like
 what, alien abduction?

967
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:15,481
 - No, like other
 kinds of accidents.

968
01:03:15,515 --> 01:03:16,482
 - Okay, hm?

969
01:03:18,035 --> 01:03:20,727
- Like what if they fell
down an abandoned well?

970
01:03:20,762 --> 01:03:22,868
- Give me a break, five
people fall down a well?

971
01:03:22,902 --> 01:03:24,835
 Yeah, maybe they were
 eaten by alligators.

972
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:26,319
Gimme a break, Pat, I mean, God,

973
01:03:26,354 --> 01:03:28,908
 even our friends
 aren't that stupid.

974
01:03:31,738 --> 01:03:33,223
 - Maybe they were
 treed by a black bear.

975
01:03:33,257 --> 01:03:35,363
 - Oh my God, your plan is
 to go up against a bear?

976
01:03:35,397 --> 01:03:37,054
 Forget that.

977
01:03:37,089 --> 01:03:39,712
 - Maybe they just
 ran afoul some locals

978
01:03:39,746 --> 01:03:41,265
 and they're all hangin' out.
 - Oh my God, hillbillies?

979
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:42,922
You gotta be kidding me.

980
01:03:42,957 --> 01:03:45,649
- I'm just saying, if
we're gonna go out there

981
01:03:45,683 --> 01:03:47,858
 to look for 'em, maybe--
 - Whoa say what, go out there?

982
01:03:47,893 --> 01:03:51,931
 Oh, no, you shoulda thought
 of that when it was light out.

983
01:03:51,966 --> 01:03:55,141
 - Amy, wouldn't you want
 them to come look for us?

984
01:03:55,176 --> 01:03:58,869
Mm-hm, thought so.

985
01:03:58,904 --> 01:04:01,768
 So we're going,
 let's go, come on.

986
01:04:02,908 --> 01:04:05,634
 I got a flashlight
 fo' you, mama.

987
01:04:07,671 --> 01:04:11,433
 - Well, at least
 we got flashlights.

988
01:04:11,468 --> 01:04:15,575
- Okay, and I will write a note
just in case they come back.

989
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:17,405
- Oh, yeah, sure, Dear Assholes,

990
01:04:17,439 --> 01:04:19,234
 if you're reading
 this, fuck you.

991
01:04:19,269 --> 01:04:21,478
 - That's nice, that's
 really sweet of you.

992
01:04:21,512 --> 01:04:22,479
I'll write that.

993
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:55,477
 Be careful, you good?

994
01:04:55,512 --> 01:04:57,963
- This sucks.

995
01:04:57,997 --> 01:05:00,068
Ow.

996
01:05:00,103 --> 01:05:02,691
You know, we brought everything
but insect repellent.

997
01:05:02,726 --> 01:05:05,280
- Amy, stop complaining.

998
01:05:05,315 --> 01:05:07,179
- What, I'm
 being eaten alive.

999
01:05:07,213 --> 01:05:10,182
- It's called
nature, be one with it.

1000
01:05:10,216 --> 01:05:12,080
 - Well, you know they're
 out there screwing around

1001
01:05:12,115 --> 01:05:15,049
 and we're stumbling around
 here getting Lyme disease.

1002
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:16,809
 - Please, really?

1003
01:05:16,843 --> 01:05:19,225
- What, I'm just saying.

1004
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:22,297
 - Saying, and
 saying, and saying.

1005
01:05:22,332 --> 01:05:23,954
 - What?
 - Let's just start at the lake

1006
01:05:23,989 --> 01:05:26,163
 and we'll work our way back.

1007
01:05:26,198 --> 01:05:28,269
This is so cool.

1008
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:30,340
 - This really sucks.

1009
01:05:30,374 --> 01:05:32,135
 I'm itchy everywhere.

1010
01:05:33,446 --> 01:05:35,483
- Oh my God, Amy!

1011
01:05:35,517 --> 01:05:38,624
- Jesus!

1012
01:05:38,658 --> 01:05:41,868
 Oh my God, now I have
 a fucking headache.

1013
01:05:41,903 --> 01:05:43,940
You're so
 easy to mess with.

1014
01:06:01,681 --> 01:06:03,649
- It's so quiet.

1015
01:06:03,683 --> 01:06:04,512
- Yeah.

1016
01:06:06,479 --> 01:06:07,653
 - Hey, idiots!

1017
01:06:14,004 --> 01:06:14,763
 - Nothing.

1018
01:06:20,114 --> 01:06:22,702
- Pat, I'm kinda really scared.

1019
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:27,397
 - Yeah, I'm right
 there with you.

1020
01:06:28,363 --> 01:06:30,503
 - I mean, this isn't right.

1021
01:06:30,538 --> 01:06:32,264
 What are we gonna do?

1022
01:06:34,852 --> 01:06:37,200
 - Think we better go get help.

1023
01:06:39,167 --> 01:06:41,204
I got somethin' for ya.

1024
01:06:41,238 --> 01:06:42,584
- Hey, was that?

1025
01:06:43,861 --> 01:06:44,690
- Yeah.

1026
01:06:50,592 --> 01:06:54,148
- Assholes.

1027
01:06:54,182 --> 01:06:56,219
- Let's just be
glad that they're okay.

1028
01:06:56,253 --> 01:06:58,083
- Oh, I'm glad, I'm
 gonna mess 'em up real good.

1029
01:06:58,117 --> 01:06:59,912
- Well,
 that's nice of you.

1030
01:06:59,946 --> 01:07:01,120
- What?

1031
01:07:01,155 --> 01:07:02,328
 You're not pissed?

1032
01:07:02,363 --> 01:07:03,536
 Look at you.

1033
01:07:03,571 --> 01:07:04,951
Look at you

1034
01:07:04,986 --> 01:07:06,505
 with that stupid
 fucking backpack.

1035
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:07,954
- Well, maybe
 because I'm the leader

1036
01:07:07,989 --> 01:07:09,611
 and I'll take care of
 things and you won't,

1037
01:07:09,646 --> 01:07:10,785
 look what you're wearing.

1038
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:12,304
 What, a hoity-toity, what,

1039
01:07:12,338 --> 01:07:14,168
 you going to the
 cabaret in the forest?

1040
01:07:14,202 --> 01:07:15,686
 - Shut up.
 - I mean, really.

1041
01:07:15,721 --> 01:07:17,171
- At least I
 don't look like a mom.

1042
01:07:17,205 --> 01:07:20,070
- Why don't we just
 go back to the campsite.

1043
01:07:20,105 --> 01:07:21,865
- Oh, jerk-off?

1044
01:07:23,108 --> 01:07:24,868
 We're gonna kick your asses.

1045
01:07:24,902 --> 01:07:26,766
- Yeah, and that's
gonna bring 'em running.

1046
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:28,078
 - Shit, I don't care,

1047
01:07:28,113 --> 01:07:29,597
 I'm pissed.
 - Shh.

1048
01:07:33,221 --> 01:07:34,222
 - So busted.

1049
01:07:42,265 --> 01:07:45,199
You're so dead!

1050
01:07:49,203 --> 01:07:50,928
- Who the fuck is that?

1051
01:07:50,963 --> 01:07:52,275
- Jesus, oh
 my God, oh my God!

1052
01:07:52,309 --> 01:07:56,072
- Hey, gang,
 what's for dinner?

1053
01:07:56,106 --> 01:07:57,176
- Amy, come on, come on!

1054
01:07:57,211 --> 01:07:58,143
- Where are we going?

1055
01:07:58,177 --> 01:07:59,558
- Run, run!

1056
01:07:59,592 --> 01:08:02,008
I don't know, keep running!

1057
01:08:02,043 --> 01:08:03,251
- Where?

1058
01:08:03,286 --> 01:08:04,942
- The boat, run towards
 the boat, hurry, come on.

1059
01:08:04,977 --> 01:08:06,496
 We'll get as far away
 from shore as we can.

1060
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:09,119
- Oh my God,
 Pat, Jenny's dead.

1061
01:08:09,154 --> 01:08:11,052
- I know, Amy, focus, the boat.

1062
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,813
 Come on, come on,
 come on, come on--

1063
01:08:18,542 --> 01:08:20,924
- Glass
 bottom boat, anyone?

1064
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:22,443
- You sick fuck!

1065
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:26,136
- Actually, I
 feel fine, how 'bout you?

1066
01:08:26,171 --> 01:08:27,931
Ooh!

1067
01:08:27,965 --> 01:08:29,829
- Run, Amy, go, run!

1068
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,282
- Pat, Pat, Pat,
 he's got me!

1069
01:08:36,767 --> 01:08:38,252
 - Don't stop, Amy.

1070
01:08:44,396 --> 01:08:47,053
 Oh, my God, Amy, Amy, okay,
 okay, Amy, okay, okay,

1071
01:08:47,088 --> 01:08:48,262
don't do this right now.

1072
01:08:48,296 --> 01:08:49,953
 - They are all dead--
 - Don't do this right now,

1073
01:08:49,987 --> 01:08:51,023
don't do this right now!

1074
01:08:51,057 --> 01:08:52,162
 - Ow, ow!
 - Stop!

1075
01:08:52,197 --> 01:08:53,646
 Listen to me, you know
 what else is gonna happen?

1076
01:08:53,681 --> 01:08:54,854
 Is we're gonna live right now.

1077
01:08:54,889 --> 01:08:56,132
 We're gonna live through
 this, all right, all right?

1078
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:57,478
This is what we're gonna do.

1079
01:08:57,512 --> 01:08:59,342
 Okay, I know, I know, I know,

1080
01:08:59,376 --> 01:09:00,791
 just gotta get keys, okay?

1081
01:09:00,826 --> 01:09:02,897
 You're gonna get Frank--
 - I don't think I can do this.

1082
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:04,726
 - You're gonna get Frank
 right now, okay, okay, go.

1083
01:09:04,761 --> 01:09:06,314
Go, go, go,

1084
01:09:06,349 --> 01:09:07,833
 you have to be quick,
 you have to be quick.

1085
01:09:09,283 --> 01:09:10,836
- I can't, I
 can't, I don't know

1086
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:12,941
where they are, my God.

1087
01:09:12,976 --> 01:09:14,219
- Find them, Amy.

1088
01:09:14,253 --> 01:09:17,325
 - I can't, I can't.
 - Okay, shh, shh, shh!

1089
01:09:18,982 --> 01:09:20,294
Get in the car, right now.

1090
01:09:20,328 --> 01:09:21,812
- Don't hit me.

1091
01:09:21,847 --> 01:09:25,747
- Maybe if you don't
 get in the fucking car--

1092
01:09:25,782 --> 01:09:26,817
All right, all right, all right,

1093
01:09:26,852 --> 01:09:28,025
 all right, all right,
 all right, all right.

1094
01:09:28,819 --> 01:09:29,993
- Oh my God, oh my God!

1095
01:09:30,027 --> 01:09:31,201
 - Get the fucking
 hood up right now!

1096
01:09:31,236 --> 01:09:32,582
- It won't go
 up, it won't go--

1097
01:09:32,616 --> 01:09:33,790
 - Pull up the hood!

1098
01:09:33,824 --> 01:09:36,689
- Keys, keys, keys, keys, keys!

1099
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:39,002
- Oh, no, oh
 my God, oh my God.

1100
01:09:41,694 --> 01:09:43,248
 Let us go!

1101
01:09:43,282 --> 01:09:44,214
 Don't!

1102
01:09:46,872 --> 01:09:48,701
- Gimme the
 keys, gimme the keys!

1103
01:09:48,736 --> 01:09:51,083
- Oh my God.
- What the fuck?

1104
01:09:52,429 --> 01:09:54,949
- I think
 I found your keys.

1105
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,503
 - Okay, okay, okay.
 - Now what, now what?

1106
01:09:57,538 --> 01:09:59,022
- You know what I'm gonna do?

1107
01:09:59,056 --> 01:10:00,437
 You run, okay?

1108
01:10:00,472 --> 01:10:01,645
I'm gonna fucking

1109
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:02,853
 and you're gonna
 run, are you ready?

1110
01:10:02,888 --> 01:10:04,476
 I'm not kidding, you have
 to run your ass off, ready?

1111
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:05,856
 Okay, ready?
 - What, are you crazy?

1112
01:10:05,891 --> 01:10:07,479
- Yes, one, two.

1113
01:10:08,756 --> 01:10:11,137
Come on, Amy, come on!

1114
01:10:11,172 --> 01:10:13,588
 Come on, come on, Amy, hurry.

1115
01:10:15,487 --> 01:10:19,629
Come on, push, push.

1116
01:10:22,597 --> 01:10:23,598
 Amy come on!

1117
01:10:28,776 --> 01:10:29,811
 Amy come on!

1118
01:10:39,718 --> 01:10:41,167
 Run, we have to run!

1119
01:10:41,202 --> 01:10:43,204
 Come on, run, run!

1120
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,550
Go, go, go, run!

1121
01:10:48,278 --> 01:10:51,661
Shit!

1122
01:10:54,388 --> 01:10:56,700
 Get up, Amy, get up, get up!

1123
01:10:59,807 --> 01:11:01,049
 Fuck you!

1124
01:11:04,467 --> 01:11:08,436
Amy, oh, fuck.

1125
01:11:10,231 --> 01:11:13,027
- Oh, hammer time.

1126
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:15,719
Bash it,  break it down.

1127
01:11:26,523 --> 01:11:28,318
- Don't you dare.

1128
01:11:28,353 --> 01:11:29,526
- Sure, what?

1129
01:11:29,561 --> 01:11:33,185
 - Don't you dare
 do anything to Pat.

1130
01:11:33,219 --> 01:11:34,600
 - What are you talking about?

1131
01:11:34,635 --> 01:11:36,326
 I take no prisoners.

1132
01:11:36,361 --> 01:11:37,534
 - I'm serious.

1133
01:11:38,397 --> 01:11:40,019
 - Look, it's just a story.

1134
01:11:40,054 --> 01:11:41,297
- I don't care!

1135
01:11:42,367 --> 01:11:43,954
 That's my sister!

1136
01:11:43,989 --> 01:11:45,301
- Okay, I won't.

1137
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,200
 - You swear?

1138
01:11:49,822 --> 01:11:54,171
- Okay, I promise
 I won't kill your sister.

1139
01:12:05,528 --> 01:12:08,669
 So, we're right back
 where we started.

1140
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,127
 Ooh, you're shot.

1141
01:12:19,162 --> 01:12:19,990
 - Go to hell.

1142
01:12:20,025 --> 01:12:21,682
- Language.

1143
01:12:22,855 --> 01:12:24,926
You're the last.

1144
01:12:24,961 --> 01:12:28,240
 Are you gonna go easy, or
 are you gonna make this hard?

1145
01:12:28,274 --> 01:12:30,656
 - Why are you doing this?

1146
01:12:30,691 --> 01:12:32,624
 - This is real life.

1147
01:12:32,658 --> 01:12:34,729
There's no sense in any of this.

1148
01:12:34,764 --> 01:12:37,180
It's just the way it is.

1149
01:12:37,214 --> 01:12:39,147
Fucked up, huh?

1150
01:12:39,182 --> 01:12:41,115
 - Please tell me why
 you're doing this.

1151
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:44,808
- Jesus, everybody's
 always gotta know why.

1152
01:12:44,843 --> 01:12:46,741
 It's embarrassing,

1153
01:12:46,776 --> 01:12:49,123
and you wouldn't believe
me if I told you.

1154
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:50,469
Ow, biting!

1155
01:12:50,504 --> 01:12:52,126
Oh!

1156
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,714
No fair.

1157
01:13:09,557 --> 01:13:11,317
 - Die, you piece of--

1158
01:13:25,021 --> 01:13:27,264
- Woo-hoo!

1159
01:13:27,299 --> 01:13:28,542
- Thank you, thank you.

1160
01:13:28,576 --> 01:13:30,682
- Wow, so it
was you the whole time.

1161
01:13:30,716 --> 01:13:31,890
- Yeah.
- Nice.

1162
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:35,307
 Oh.

1163
01:13:35,341 --> 01:13:36,998
 Wow, this doesn't--

1164
01:13:37,033 --> 01:13:38,655
 - Doesn't look right.

1165
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:40,864
 - Yeah, it's really quiet.

1166
01:13:42,521 --> 01:13:45,455
 - Maybe they're at
 the lake, hiking.

1167
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:47,008
 - Oh, my friends?

1168
01:13:47,043 --> 01:13:50,529
No, no, see, they're permanently
tethered to a beer cooler.

1169
01:13:50,564 --> 01:13:54,360
They're like good for
20 feet off shore, max.

1170
01:13:55,707 --> 01:13:57,916
 They don't really swim either,
 they kinda flop around.

1171
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:04,301
- What was that?

1172
01:14:04,336 --> 01:14:05,579
- I don't know.

1173
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:09,824
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

1174
01:14:09,859 --> 01:14:11,585
- Look, this doesn't feel right.

1175
01:14:11,619 --> 01:14:13,241
I think we should drive
back down the road

1176
01:14:13,276 --> 01:14:16,037
 until we get a phone signal,
 call someone for some help.

1177
01:14:16,072 --> 01:14:17,798
 - No, no, those are
 my friends in there

1178
01:14:17,832 --> 01:14:19,662
 and what if something
 bad has happened to them?

1179
01:14:19,696 --> 01:14:23,217
- Linda, I'm many
things, but I'm no hero.

1180
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,841
- God.

1181
01:14:26,876 --> 01:14:28,671
 - No, no, no, no.

1182
01:14:28,705 --> 01:14:30,293
 I'm gonna go investigate.

1183
01:14:30,327 --> 01:14:31,259
- Yeah, let's go.

1184
01:14:31,294 --> 01:14:32,882
 - No, I'm gonna go investigate

1185
01:14:32,916 --> 01:14:34,642
 under the condition
 that you wait here

1186
01:14:34,677 --> 01:14:37,749
 and you do not follow
 until I tell you it's safe.

1187
01:14:37,783 --> 01:14:39,992
 - Oh no, you do not
 leave me in this car.

1188
01:14:40,027 --> 01:14:41,235
 - Look, Your Highness,

1189
01:14:41,269 --> 01:14:43,340
 you're gonna do what
 I tell you to do

1190
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:47,448
 or I'm gonna drive us both
 out of here right now.

1191
01:14:48,553 --> 01:14:49,657
 - Okay, okay.

1192
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,348
- What?

1193
01:14:58,045 --> 01:14:59,287
You're a loony.

1194
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:01,600
 - Be careful.

1195
01:15:02,912 --> 01:15:03,740
- Yeah.

1196
01:15:55,067 --> 01:15:56,586
Oh, God.

1197
01:15:56,621 --> 01:15:57,760
 Oh, fuck this.

1198
01:16:20,886 --> 01:16:21,715
 Aaron?

1199
01:16:22,888 --> 01:16:24,338
 Aaron?

1200
01:16:24,372 --> 01:16:25,201
 Fuck.

1201
01:16:26,409 --> 01:16:27,237
 Fuck.

1202
01:16:29,895 --> 01:16:31,172
 Goddammit.

1203
01:16:44,738 --> 01:16:45,601
 Aaron?

1204
01:16:47,326 --> 01:16:48,155
 Aaron?

1205
01:16:51,468 --> 01:16:55,472
 I swear to God, Aaron,
 if you don't answer me...

1206
01:17:02,721 --> 01:17:03,584
 - Run!

1207
01:17:19,945 --> 01:17:20,774
 Patricia.

1208
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:29,575
 - What the?

1209
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:33,027
 Uh-oh.

1210
01:17:38,723 --> 01:17:39,585
 Surprise.

1211
01:17:41,415 --> 01:17:44,521
 Told you I wouldn't
 kill your sister.

1212
01:17:46,765 --> 01:17:50,182
Really,
 Linda, I have to say,

1213
01:17:50,217 --> 01:17:51,908
 I'm very disappointed in you.

1214
01:17:51,943 --> 01:17:55,187
 I had you pegged as a fighter.

1215
01:17:55,222 --> 01:17:58,570
 Maybe it's better
 that you folded early.

1216
01:18:00,434 --> 01:18:02,194
 'Cause I'm exhausted.

1217
01:18:04,058 --> 01:18:07,234
 Getting you out here
 was a real chore.

1218
01:18:08,235 --> 01:18:09,650
 Constant nagging.

1219
01:18:10,893 --> 01:18:12,515
 Day in and day out.

1220
01:18:16,174 --> 01:18:18,935
Like fingernails
on a chalkboard.

1221
01:18:36,608 --> 01:18:38,679
 Wanna see something cool?

1222
01:18:42,131 --> 01:18:43,719
 This is my passion.

1223
01:18:45,099 --> 01:18:49,379
 It's sort of a spin-art
 scrapbook of my greatest hits.

1224
01:18:52,831 --> 01:18:53,763
 Here's Jon,

1225
01:18:56,214 --> 01:18:57,042
 Amy,

1226
01:19:01,012 --> 01:19:02,289
Frank, and Ken.

1227
01:19:05,464 --> 01:19:06,776
Here's Jen, Roy,

1228
01:19:08,364 --> 01:19:09,227
 oh, look,

1229
01:19:11,229 --> 01:19:14,094
 here's a little of
 your handy work.

1230
01:19:14,128 --> 01:19:15,129
 It's your sister, Pat.

1231
01:19:15,164 --> 01:19:16,096
 - Fuck you!

1232
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,859
 - You know, I do like you,

1233
01:19:20,894 --> 01:19:23,275
 as much as I can like anyone.

1234
01:19:23,310 --> 01:19:24,760
 I know I'm a nut.

1235
01:19:25,864 --> 01:19:27,763
 There's really nothing
 I can do about it

1236
01:19:27,797 --> 01:19:30,006
 short of the death penalty.

1237
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:36,772
 Hm.

1238
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,018
 You know, if this had
 been in one of my stories,

1239
01:19:42,053 --> 01:19:43,813
 you'd be laughing
 out loud, right?

1240
01:19:43,848 --> 01:19:46,609
 Someone getting cut with a
 knife full of buttercream?

1241
01:19:48,093 --> 01:19:48,887
 - Hey.

1242
01:19:52,753 --> 01:19:54,168
 Baby.
 - Oh my God.

1243
01:19:55,998 --> 01:19:57,171
Oh my God.
- You all right?

1244
01:19:57,206 --> 01:19:58,724
- Yeah.

1245
01:19:58,759 --> 01:20:01,106
 Thought I was dead.

1246
01:20:01,141 --> 01:20:02,590
 Get those untied.

1247
01:20:04,523 --> 01:20:09,149
- Hey, it's okay.

1248
01:20:09,183 --> 01:20:12,324
Nobody kills my girl,
all right?

1249
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:16,846
 - I think this makes up for
 everything you've ever done.

1250
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:30,860
 - I think you broke my jaw.

1251
01:20:30,895 --> 01:20:31,999
 - Let's double check.

1252
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:43,390
 Enjoy your birthday cake,
 Dumbfuck, it's your last.

1253
01:20:43,424 --> 01:20:44,322
 - Fuck you!

1254
01:20:45,668 --> 01:20:46,496
 Fuck!

1255
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:48,498
 Is he?

1256
01:20:48,533 --> 01:20:50,707
 - Yeah, I believe so.

1257
01:20:50,742 --> 01:20:52,468
 I'm sorry for everything.

1258
01:20:52,502 --> 01:20:53,745
 I love you, you
 know that, right?

1259
01:20:53,779 --> 01:20:55,367
 - I love you too,
 I love you so much.

1260
01:20:55,402 --> 01:20:56,575
- Things are gonna be different.

1261
01:20:56,610 --> 01:20:58,163
 - Oh, no, let's not talk
 about that right now, okay?

1262
01:20:58,198 --> 01:20:59,475
 Let's just get the
 fuck out of here.

1263
01:20:59,509 --> 01:21:00,648
- Yeah.

1264
01:21:04,342 --> 01:21:05,757
 - What the?

1265
01:21:05,791 --> 01:21:08,725
Oh my God.

1266
01:21:10,244 --> 01:21:13,040
 Oh my God, Kyle,
 what's happening?

1267
01:21:14,386 --> 01:21:16,216
Oh my God, Kyle?

1268
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:18,149
Kyle, what's happening?

1269
01:21:19,012 --> 01:21:20,358
 Oh my God!

1270
01:21:33,302 --> 01:21:34,234
 - You know,

1271
01:21:37,168 --> 01:21:40,757
you were really the
only one I ever wanted.

1272
01:21:43,208 --> 01:21:45,935
 But when you were a
 no-show, I had to improvise.

1273
01:21:56,049 --> 01:22:01,054
And I live happily, ever...

1274
01:22:04,022 --> 01:22:04,850
 After.

1275
01:22:31,567 --> 01:22:32,395
 Hm,

1276
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:36,710
 the neighbors are so quiet.

1277
01:22:36,744 --> 01:22:38,229
 Hope they're okay.

1278
01:22:48,515 --> 01:22:49,343
 Zzzz!

1279
01:22:56,764 --> 01:22:59,871
Is it all right if I
keep this, as a memento?

1280
01:22:59,905 --> 01:23:00,734
Thanks.

1281
01:23:05,325 --> 01:23:06,153
 You know,

1282
01:23:07,327 --> 01:23:10,123
 I almost feel sorry
 for you, dude.

1283
01:23:11,814 --> 01:23:16,267
 You're not gonna be around
 to enjoy the peace and quiet.

1284
01:23:16,301 --> 01:23:18,786
 Dad would be so proud.

1285
01:23:29,314 --> 01:23:30,833
- You!

1286
01:23:32,041 --> 01:23:33,353
It's always you.

1287
01:23:34,285 --> 01:23:37,667
You!

1288
01:23:37,702 --> 01:23:39,497
It's always you.

1289
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:43,328
It's always you.

1290
01:23:45,089 --> 01:23:47,194
 It's always gonna be you.

1291
01:23:53,131 --> 01:23:54,822
 - This really hurts.

1292
01:24:00,897 --> 01:24:02,658
 I hope that doesn't stain.

1293
01:24:02,692 --> 01:24:04,246
- Look
 at the mess you made!

1294
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:05,799

1295
01:24:06,938 --> 01:24:08,595
