367
00:35:11,287 --> 00:35:13,076
Look I'm sorry about
getting upset before

368
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:16,202
I just think I deserve to
know about my release date.

369
00:35:16,204 --> 00:35:20,161
Of course this of course

00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:23,663
you'll never hear from me again

372
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,203
I'm an expert at keeping my
mouth shut.

373
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:28,162
Of course you are.

374
00:35:28,164 --> 00:35:30,245

comes to illegal stuff.

375
00:35:30,247 --> 00:35:34,496

379
00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:15,458
What do about his piano tuning
business?

380
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,335
Nothing really.

381
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:19,375
We found 10 pounds of heroin

382
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,252
inside the piano next to his
body

383
00:36:22,378 --> 00:36:24,501

No.

387
00:36:29,503 --> 00:36:31,628
Do you know who the piano was
meant for?

388
00:36:33,337 --> 00:36:35,710
Do where the piano was supposed
to go?

389
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,254
No I don't know anything
about the stupid piano

390
00:36:39,379 --> 00:36:40,419
I don't know who it was for

391
00:36:40,421 --> 00:36:42,253
I don't know where it was going

392
00:36:42,255 --> 00:36:45,172
and I didn't know there were
drugs inside.

393
00:37:14,216 --> 00:37:17,216

400
00:41:30,702 --> 00:41:35,200
Just relax Sharyn breath

401
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:37,410
Oh my God.

402
00:41:38,535 --> 00:41:40,536
I told you not to roam

403
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:42,494
what happened?

404
00:42:02,205 --> 00:42:03,746
So What frightened Sharyn?

405
00:42:08,164 --> 00:42:10,747
There was a piano and

406
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:15,914
And?

407
00:42:18,957 --> 00:42:22,165
You saw a piano and?

408
00:42:28,499 --> 00:42:29,999
Are you elucidating Sharyn?

409
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:37,125
I see what's going on here.

410
00:42:41,042 --> 00:42:42,540
I think it's time we analyze

411
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:44,125
what's going on inside your
head.

412
00:42:47,626 --> 00:42:49,793
There's nothing to analyze.

413
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:01,627
Miss. Berkley.

414
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:17,169
Nice place you got here.

415
00:43:17,171 --> 00:43:20,796
Thank you I grew up
here it was my mom's.

416
00:43:23,171 --> 00:43:25,795
As the investigation closed.

417
00:43:25,797 --> 00:43:29,003
We found no evidence of foul
play in determined his death

418
00:43:29,005 --> 00:43:30,047
to be a suicide.

419
00:43:34,006 --> 00:43:38,963
I know what it's like to
lose someone it's not easy.

420
00:43:38,965 --> 00:43:41,379
You lost someone you were
close with

421
00:43:41,381 --> 00:43:44,924
My little brother he
also took his own life.

422
00:43:49,216 --> 00:43:52,339
I took him to a shooting
range for his birthday

423
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:53,840
he went to learn how to shoot

424
00:43:53,842 --> 00:43:55,675
or at least that's what he told
me.

425
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,048
It was fine for a while,

426
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,715
but then it started getting
cold.

427
00:43:59,717 --> 00:44:02,008
He asked me to go grab
his jacket from the car,

428
00:44:03,009 --> 00:44:05,593
and by the time I went
back he shot himself.

429
00:44:07,968 --> 00:44:08,884
That's terrible.

430
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:14,885
How do you deal with something
like that?

431
00:44:17,094 --> 00:44:22,176
I started going to church I
go every time I think of him,

432
00:44:22,178 --> 00:44:23,970
I just sit there with myself

433
00:44:25,636 --> 00:44:28,095
it does it take long
for me to feel better?

434
00:44:31,136 --> 00:44:32,054
It sounds nice.

435
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:35,721
Maybe you should try.

436
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:44,803
[knocking door]

437
00:44:44,805 --> 00:44:45,680

438
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:01,640
How long have you been here?

439
00:45:03,682 --> 00:45:06,472
I don't know nobody knows.

440
00:45:06,474 --> 00:45:09,641
No clocks no windows so
it's always nighttime.

441
00:45:11,016 --> 00:45:12,641
So how they get in your head?

442
00:45:13,766 --> 00:45:14,725
I never stop.

443
00:45:18,725 --> 00:45:21,057
Can they make you see things

444
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:23,390
and feel things that aren't
there?

445
00:45:23,392 --> 00:45:26,684
Yeah absolutely they're very
good.

446
00:45:35,977 --> 00:45:38,227
You said they burned you
alive?

447
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:41,853
Yeah three times they put in
oven

448
00:45:45,186 --> 00:45:46,936
first My skin blisters,

449
00:45:48,187 --> 00:45:50,020
when my blisters start to burst

450
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:54,354
then my eyes start boiling,

451
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,105
I can't see,

452
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:01,438
but I can still feel and smell

453
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,853
you know the stench of
your own flesh cooking

454
00:46:05,855 --> 00:46:07,272
is something you never forget.

455
00:46:12,189 --> 00:46:13,981
Do you ever think about
escaping?

456
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,107
Are you fucking kidding me?

457
00:46:18,023 --> 00:46:20,813
I have some ideas I think
we can get out of here,

458
00:46:20,815 --> 00:46:25,188
Sharyn why don't I help
you back to your room

459
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:26,483
Indexing is about to begin.

460
00:46:38,067 --> 00:46:39,817
Let me give an hand.

461
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:49,774

percent.

462
00:46:49,776 --> 00:46:51,441
Give it time Sharyn.

463
00:46:51,443 --> 00:46:55,319

how did they get anything
done in this place?

471
00:47:32,822 --> 00:47:34,863
Well they keep all these
papers on file

472
00:47:34,865 --> 00:47:36,488
It makes things easier to burn.

473
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,279
If this thing get out of
the opening which it works,

474
00:47:38,281 --> 00:47:40,531
the government can't
just shove it on the rug.

again...

549
00:59:47,066 --> 00:59:51,607
Help I need some help hello.

550
00:59:52,775 --> 00:59:53,608
Hello.

551
00:59:59,942 --> 01:00:01,192
Is anybody home?

552
01:00:40,905 --> 01:00:41,780
Hello.

553
01:01:41,369 --> 01:01:44,369
[breathing heavily]

554
01:02:07,206 --> 01:02:09,414
No please don't.

555
01:02:21,332 --> 01:02:23,457
[choking]

556
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:40,082
[Hellenbach] There is
something amazing

557
01:02:40,084 --> 01:02:44,918
about this trust, it fulfills
its own expectations

558
01:02:49,335 --> 01:02:51,043
let's talk more about your past.

559
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,794
Why do you keep healing me?

560
01:02:57,461 --> 01:02:59,502
I don't you just kill me?

561
01:03:00,461 --> 01:03:02,461
[Hellenbach] We don't kill
people here.

562
01:03:04,378 --> 01:03:06,335
So let's talk about the worst

563
01:03:06,337 --> 01:03:09,003
that you think you've ever
done in your life Sharyn.

564
01:03:13,546 --> 01:03:15,377
I was a drug addict.

565
01:03:15,379 --> 01:03:17,921
[Hellenbach] I know
all about that what else?

566
01:03:22,671 --> 01:03:24,047
There's nothing else.

567
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:30,753
It's always good to tell the
truth,

568
01:03:30,755 --> 01:03:33,506
unless of course you weren't
exceptionally good liar,

569
01:03:34,506 --> 01:03:36,048
which you are not.

570
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,381
But what were you going to
school for?

571
01:03:56,383 --> 01:03:58,008
I was majoring in English.

572
01:03:59,258 --> 01:04:02,093
English what do you want
to be an English teacher?

573
01:04:03,551 --> 01:04:08,509
No I wanna work in
publishing I'm a journalist.

574
01:04:08,968 --> 01:04:11,342
You could give me the
scoop on some good stories.

575
01:04:11,344 --> 01:04:13,175
Trust me you don't wanna
write about the story

576
01:04:13,177 --> 01:04:16,552
that I deal with unless you
like living without sleep.

577
01:04:20,135 --> 01:04:22,259
It's that bad then why do you
do it?

578
01:04:22,261 --> 01:04:24,053
It's not bad it's just that

579
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:27,553
there's more to life than work,

580
01:04:29,595 --> 01:04:32,596
I wonder what's everyone else
does.

581
01:04:33,512 --> 01:04:35,304
Family, kids, all that.

582
01:04:38,262 --> 01:04:39,512
Not everybody wants that.

583
01:04:46,305 --> 01:04:48,386
How did you wind up here?

584
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:49,263
Car accident?

585
01:04:50,598 --> 01:04:51,639
Was it serious?

586
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,264
It was pretty bad.

587
01:04:55,556 --> 01:04:58,556
Broken ribs had neck injuries

588
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:02,099
and then I wound up here.

589
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:10,183
Did you ever do anything
that was really awful.

590
01:05:12,766 --> 01:05:13,973
Why do you ask?

591
01:05:13,975 --> 01:05:17,100
Because 10 years ago I did
something that was terrible

592
01:05:19,767 --> 01:05:22,559
and I don't wanna talk about
it or tell you what it was,

593
01:05:23,767 --> 01:05:25,017
but it was really bad

594
01:05:27,476 --> 01:05:28,977
and it's drowning me,

595
01:05:31,268 --> 01:05:32,977
and I think that's why I'm here.

596
01:05:35,477 --> 01:05:36,393
What about you?

597
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:42,184
I'm not really sure I follow,

598
01:05:42,186 --> 01:05:45,017
but I haven't done anything
to warrant this kind of abuse.

599
01:05:45,019 --> 01:05:45,686
Really?

600
01:05:47,479 --> 01:05:48,354
Absolutely not.

601
01:05:51,812 --> 01:05:54,062
You know Everett we're in the
same boat

602
01:05:54,812 --> 01:05:56,352
and I'm trying to steer us to
shore,

603
01:05:56,354 --> 01:05:58,063
but you got to pick up the
slack.

604
01:06:13,689 --> 01:06:16,232
[soft music]

605
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:30,274
You're not drinking what's
going on?

606
01:06:34,816 --> 01:06:36,067
I'm pregnant.

607
01:06:40,442 --> 01:06:42,067
You're pregnant.

608
01:06:44,693 --> 01:06:49,276
Well that's great isn't it?

609
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:55,069
Before we go any further I
have to tell you something.

610
01:07:08,695 --> 01:07:10,153
I thought you were dead.

611
01:07:26,614 --> 01:07:29,489
They wanna keep burning me
alive,

612
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,865
the sad part is I deserve it.

613
01:07:35,865 --> 01:07:37,615
Nobody deserves that.

614
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,867
A few weeks ago I
broke into a Mink farm,

615
01:07:57,658 --> 01:08:00,198
there were 650 Minks

616
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,409
waiting to be slaughtered for
their fur,

617
01:08:03,993 --> 01:08:05,576
and I couldn't let that happen

618
01:08:06,951 --> 01:08:08,326
I needed to get them out,

619
01:08:10,284 --> 01:08:11,827
but I couldn't just leave at
that

620
01:08:12,827 --> 01:08:15,660
you know I need you to stop
the whole thing from happening,

621
01:08:18,452 --> 01:08:19,369
so I burned it,

622
01:08:22,495 --> 01:08:24,328
I burned the whole farm to the
ground,

623
01:08:29,328 --> 01:08:31,496
the farmers were still
sleeping in the house

624
01:08:33,662 --> 01:08:34,662
husband and wife

625
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:38,579
and they didn't make it out.

626
01:08:40,413 --> 01:08:43,705
The thing is I knew they
were in there I knew it,

627
01:08:45,372 --> 01:08:46,995
and I thought that they deserved
it

628
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:49,206
for killing all those beautiful
animals,

629
01:08:50,956 --> 01:08:52,539
but then I realized it's me,

630
01:08:53,873 --> 01:08:55,414
I'm the one that deserves it,

631
01:08:57,873 --> 01:08:59,665
I just wish they would let me
die,

632
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:06,290
you only way out of here is
death.

633
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:16,958
Cassandra we're already dead.

634
01:09:19,876 --> 01:09:20,751
What?

635
01:09:22,001 --> 01:09:26,001
Before you got here you ate
poisonous mushrooms right?

636
01:09:27,877 --> 01:09:30,918
And before I got here I
had emergency surgery,

637
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:36,418
before Everett got here he
was in a fatal car accident,

638
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:41,836
don't you see you, me, him

639
01:09:43,919 --> 01:09:45,711
we're all dead

640
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,004
and I think this place is hell.

641
01:09:55,337 --> 01:09:57,463
What did you do why are you
here?

642
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:02,463
10 years ago I killed my
ex-boyfriend,

643
01:10:04,796 --> 01:10:06,545
we got high on some shit
he bought in Mexico,

644
01:10:06,547 --> 01:10:08,381
and we got in a fight.

645
01:10:12,381 --> 01:10:14,631
[screaming]

646
01:10:38,384 --> 01:10:40,634
[screaming]

647
01:10:48,176 --> 01:10:50,676
[soft music]

648
01:10:54,427 --> 01:10:56,592
But you didn't mean to kill
him

649
01:10:56,594 --> 01:10:58,927
it was an accident wasn't it?

650
01:10:59,844 --> 01:11:01,511
That part was an accident

651
01:11:03,678 --> 01:11:05,720
but what happened wasn't.

652
01:11:12,595 --> 01:11:15,596
[suspenseful music]

653
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,471
why did you do that?

654
01:11:39,473 --> 01:11:42,932
'Cause I panic I
couldn't think straight.

655
01:11:45,682 --> 01:11:48,016
[soft music]

656
01:11:51,099 --> 01:11:55,850
I want you to forget all
this I beg you forget it.

657
01:12:01,059 --> 01:12:04,059
[suspenseful music]

658
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:31,771
I see you like to do some
light reading.

659
01:12:34,771 --> 01:12:36,812
You've read Dante's Inferno.

660
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:39,855
Yes when I was in college,

661
01:12:41,605 --> 01:12:42,605
ordered me to death,

662
01:12:44,772 --> 01:12:46,605
but I do remember some things

663
01:12:49,606 --> 01:12:51,606
like when Dante travels through
hell

664
01:12:53,148 --> 01:12:54,731
how the centers are tortured

665
01:12:55,648 --> 01:12:59,024
and then healed only to be
tortured again

666
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:02,065
sound familiar.

667
01:13:04,065 --> 01:13:07,524
Very good most people
never figure it out.

668
01:13:09,983 --> 01:13:10,858
Who are you?

669
01:13:12,733 --> 01:13:15,816
Are you Satan?

670
01:13:17,817 --> 01:13:18,942
There is no Satan.

671
01:13:23,567 --> 01:13:25,651
I'm a patient to just like you.

672
01:13:28,527 --> 01:13:30,066
What?

673
01:13:30,068 --> 01:13:31,902
Everybody down here is Sharyn

674
01:13:32,985 --> 01:13:35,027
I was a doctor not there

675
01:13:36,568 --> 01:13:41,569
I enjoyed my power a little
too much off my patients,

676
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:46,111
I prescribed medicine opiates
primarily

677
01:13:47,195 --> 01:13:50,652
myself when your boyfriend
actually have a lot in common,

678
01:13:50,654 --> 01:13:52,654
except that my drug dealings
were legal.

679
01:13:53,612 --> 01:13:57,194
I had a lot of books with
the pharmaceutical companies,

680
01:13:57,196 --> 01:14:01,988
I was way ahead of the
curve in that regard,

681
01:14:02,863 --> 01:14:04,113
it was a nice life,

682
01:14:06,697 --> 01:14:10,947
but people's guide overdoses and

683
01:14:16,907 --> 01:14:19,740
it doesn't really matter
because I had no remorse at all,

684
01:14:21,073 --> 01:14:22,071
actually I didn't realize

685
01:14:22,073 --> 01:14:25,241
what kind of suffering
I did until I got here,

686
01:14:27,074 --> 01:14:30,991
they punished me overdose after
overdose

687
01:14:33,616 --> 01:14:35,073
they don't overdose me with
narcotics,

688
01:14:35,075 --> 01:14:37,950
they overdose me with bile.

689
01:14:39,825 --> 01:14:42,740
[screams]

690
01:14:42,742 --> 01:14:47,158
So doctors torture other
doctors?

691
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,035
That's the way the system
works

692
01:14:50,035 --> 01:14:52,908
whoever comes down here is
evaluated

693
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:54,159
then after three months,

694
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:58,659
they're enrolled in the program
to begin to torture others.

695
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,325
But what if you don't want to
torture?

696
01:15:00,327 --> 01:15:03,662
Well then you are
punished for it you see

697
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,620
hell is a self-perpetuating
system of cruelty.

698
01:15:13,121 --> 01:15:14,788
How long have you been here?

699
01:15:18,329 --> 01:15:19,954
Since 1969.

700
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:27,247
So you're some sort of
know it all kind of guy.

701
01:15:28,789 --> 01:15:30,205
I guess you could say that.

702
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:33,790
Can a person die here?

703
01:15:35,956 --> 01:15:38,371
Like a final absolute death.

704
01:15:38,373 --> 01:15:41,496
Absolute death is absolution.

705
01:15:41,498 --> 01:15:44,124
Hell is not about absolution.

706
01:15:48,999 --> 01:15:53,875
[screaming]

707
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:58,956
No you don't have to do this.

708
01:15:58,958 --> 01:16:01,874
What makes you think I don't
want to?

709
01:16:01,876 --> 01:16:04,834
[breathing heavily]

710
01:16:06,376 --> 01:16:07,251
Nico.

711
01:16:08,418 --> 01:16:10,835
[groaning]

712
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:30,004
You love me once remember?

713
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:32,462
I loved you too.

714
01:16:33,921 --> 01:16:35,754
Nobody loved you like I did

715
01:16:36,421 --> 01:16:37,296
nobody

716
01:16:44,005 --> 01:16:46,297
I'm the only one who puts
candles on your grave,

717
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:50,214
and I'm sorry I killed you

718
01:16:52,214 --> 01:16:53,714
and I can't change it,

719
01:16:54,881 --> 01:16:55,881
but I can pay for it

720
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:01,424
so hang me please

721
01:17:02,882 --> 01:17:06,213
but don't let me down lock
the door and walk away

722
01:17:06,215 --> 01:17:07,174
and let me rot.

723
01:17:19,092 --> 01:17:21,259
It doesn't work that way.

724
01:17:33,343 --> 01:17:34,218
Come on.

725
01:17:44,469 --> 01:17:46,220
Where do you think you're
going?

726
01:17:47,637 --> 01:17:49,385
This is a private matter.

727
01:17:49,387 --> 01:17:52,302
When you come, come and get
me you know that.

728
01:17:52,304 --> 01:17:53,427
This is none of your business.

729
01:17:53,429 --> 01:17:56,469
Well actually it is my
business in all these years

730
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:58,386
I have never failed in
delivering a patient

731
01:17:58,388 --> 01:18:00,094
and I will not start today.

732
01:18:00,096 --> 01:18:02,055
am the reason she's here

733
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:05,094
I decide what happens to her.

734
01:18:05,096 --> 01:18:08,637
Oh in that case maybe I
should talk to the people

735
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:10,306
that decide what happens to you

736
01:18:12,931 --> 01:18:15,057
they will mow you down Nico,

737
01:18:15,932 --> 01:18:17,096
they go they will peel off your
skin,

738
01:18:17,098 --> 01:18:18,932
they will drink your blood

739
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:22,307
because I know how things
work done here Nico

740
01:18:23,307 --> 01:18:26,933
so do you really want me to
complicate things for you?

741
01:18:30,016 --> 01:18:31,224
You're full of shit Doc.

742
01:18:53,018 --> 01:18:55,144

[lighting and thunder]

746
01:20:03,234 --> 01:20:04,566
Go.

747
01:20:04,568 --> 01:20:06,234
It was nice seeing you.

748
01:20:09,234 --> 01:20:11,525

749
01:20:11,527 --> 01:20:13,150

750
01:20:13,152 --> 01:20:14,442
[Doc] Charge.

751
01:20:14,444 --> 01:20:16,275
[Doc] Clear.

752
01:20:16,277 --> 01:20:18,025
[Doc] I'm taking charge.

753
01:20:18,027 --> 01:20:19,108
[Doc] Clear.

754
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:20,528
[Doc] Come on...

755
01:20:26,278 --> 01:20:29,279
[suspenseful music]

756
01:20:37,446 --> 01:20:38,485
[Doc] Charge.

757
01:20:38,487 --> 01:20:39,613
[Doc] Clear.

758
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:55,656
[bell ringing]

759
01:21:23,367 --> 01:21:24,201
Go.

760
01:21:32,202 --> 01:21:35,202
[suspenseful music]

761
01:21:41,703 --> 01:21:46,704
[groaning]

762
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:05,080
[soft music]

763
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:44,958
How are we feeling?

764
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,624
Where am I?

765
01:22:46,626 --> 01:22:49,543
Holy cross hospital
you been out for awhile.

766
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:51,916
Out?

767
01:22:51,918 --> 01:22:53,667
We ran into some complications

768
01:22:53,669 --> 01:22:55,459
we had to put you into
a medically induced coma

769
01:22:55,461 --> 01:22:57,292
in order to clean out your
abdomen,

770
01:22:57,294 --> 01:22:59,794
there was an infection
inside your heart stopped

771
01:23:01,211 --> 01:23:02,169
we thought we lost.

772
01:23:05,295 --> 01:23:06,295
I Died?

773
01:23:07,545 --> 01:23:10,337
Clinically speaking yes you
were dead for about 15 seconds

774
01:23:11,587 --> 01:23:14,254
It felt like a lot
longer than 15 seconds.

775
01:23:18,838 --> 01:23:21,586
I wouldn't do that
just give it a few days

776
01:23:21,588 --> 01:23:23,420
and you'll be back home,

777
01:23:23,422 --> 01:23:24,422
you take care Sharyn.

778
01:23:29,964 --> 01:23:31,128
Mom.

779
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:34,173
Hey we can't disturb mommy
she's been through a lot.

780
01:23:35,006 --> 01:23:36,173
I love it.

781
01:23:39,798 --> 01:23:40,963
I'm glad to have you back,

782
01:23:40,965 --> 01:23:43,174
I'm glad to be back.

783
01:23:48,299 --> 01:23:52,423
You look pretty damn good
for someone who is dead,

784
01:23:52,425 --> 01:23:54,633
It's the miracle of modern
medicine.
