00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,062
Sy, the photo guy.

182
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,154
Nina: Oh, yeah.

183
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,234
Sy took it
to finish off the roll.

184
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,022
I get you
anything else, Sy?

185
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,567
Oh, no, thanks.
Just the check's fine.

186
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,261
What you got there,
family photos?

187
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:47,531
Yeah.

188
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,164
Yeah? You mind
if I take a look?

189
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,212
Mmm, these are
beautiful.

190
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,146
That's a good shot.

191
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,047
These your,
uh, relations?

192
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,121
Yes. That's my little
nephew,Jake.

193
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,418
He's a handsome boy.

194
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,152
Isn't he?

195
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,286
Yeah. l, uh, I got him
a camera for his birthday.

196
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,855
Oh. Well, you must be
his favorite uncle then.

197
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,525
I don't know.

198
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,365
Sure I can't get you
no more coffee then?

199
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:20,995
Oh, no. I'm fine, thanks.

200
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,302
Have a nice night now.

201
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,501
You, too.

202
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,544
Jake: Mom?

203
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:05,650
Nina: What, pookie?

204
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,151
I feel bad for someone.

205
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,051
Somebody at school?

206
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,317
No.

207
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,949
What do you mean,
you feel bad?

208
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,961
When someone seems sad...

209
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,054
they don't have
any friends...

210
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,600
and people
make fun of'em...

211
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,261
that makes me
feel bad for them.

212
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,601
Who is sad and doesn't
have any friends?

213
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:31,431
Sy.

214
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,636
Sy?

215
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,304
The photo guy
at the one hour place?

216
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,676
Yeah.

217
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:38,807
[Chuckles]
Oh,Jake.

218
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:42,251
I really
feel bad for him.

219
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,482
But Jake...

220
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,754
we don't know
that Sy is sad.

221
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:54,731
We really don't know
that much about him, you know?

222
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,235
I mean, he might even
have a lot of friends.

223
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,770
He probably has a girlfriend

224
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:04,001
and--and a mommy
and a daddy who love him.

225
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:07,112

he does.

[Sighs]
Oh. Tch.

227
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,649
That is so sweet of you

228
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:16,483
to think of somebody else
like that, you know?

229
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,956

Listen,Jake...

230
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,558

is as lucky as we are.

You know?

232
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:31,465
But maybe if we send them
good thoughts...

233
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,072
we'll make them
feel better.

234
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,672
So why don't we
close our eyes

235
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,677
and send Sy
some good thoughts?

236
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:41,905
Okay.

237
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,313
Okay? All right? Ready?

238
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,078
Yeah.

239
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,370
There.

240
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,414
Nina: I bet the next time
we see Sy...

241
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,886
he won't seem so sad.

242
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,456
Okay.

243
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,990
You have to go
to sleep, pookie.

244
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,493
Okay.

245
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,324

we pay for all this?

Will: How--How do you think
we pay for all this?

253
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,485
I'm just asking you.
What do you think...

254
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:30,680
there's a money fairy
that comes

255
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,723
and slips an envelope
under my pillow every month?

256
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,951
What are you even
talkin' about?

257
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,152
Well--Well, how--

you have on now--how?

I love you, Nina. I do...

261
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,201
but if you continually
want our life

262
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,302
to look like something
out of a magazine, I'm sorry.

263
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,813
I've gotta work
to make that happen.

Do you even believe
what you're saying, huh?

265
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,882
This is not
about things, Will...

266
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,754
and it's not
about money.

267
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,060
You're neglectful.

268
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,825
Do you understand that?

269
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,900
What?

270
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,526
You are an emotionally
neglectful husband...

271
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,762
and you're
an emotionally

272
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,773
neglectful father.
Got it now?

273
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,274
That's just fuckin' great.
Neglectful?

274

You're not here,

who only takes pictures
of her cats.

00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,883

Your customers.

336

337
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,618
that a plus point 3
shift to cyan

338
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,277
is insignificant.
It's massive.

Sy, let me try and explain
something to you one more time.

340
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,721
You need to take
another look

341
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,127
at your place
on the food chain.

342
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,722
These aren't your customers.

343
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,391
They're SavMart's customers.

on paper towels
and socks.

348
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,135
If they wanted to see
yelling and screaming...

to create a scene

never think about it...

437

the blink of an eye.

536
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,721
and then I broke
my collarbone...

537
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,162
and I had to wear
this weird cast

538
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:04,792
where I kept my arm up
like this all winter.

539
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:08,303
I wasn't exactly
the most popular kid.

540
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,270
How'd you break
your collarbone?

541
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:13,571
Oh, I fell
out of a tree.

542
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,008
How's your dad
doing?

543
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,580
Good.

544
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,341
Does he come
to see the games?

545
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,542
Yeah, sometimes.

546
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,118
Does he come to see
any of the games?

547
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,017
He's really busy
at work.

548
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,751
I don't know. He's--
He's busy all the time.

549
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,327
He sounds like
an important guy.

550
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:33,625
I guess. He owns a company
and everything.

551
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,631
Probably just wants
to make sure

552
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,132
that you and your mom

553
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,634
have all the nice things
you want...

554
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:41,705
like that cool bike
and those soccer shoes.

555
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,898
Hold on.

556
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:49,510
Yeah. You know,
those things cost money.

557
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:50,842
He'd be here
if he could.

558
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,643
I guess.

559
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,480
I got something for you.

560
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,625
Wanna guess what it is?

561
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,002
Whoa.

562
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,611
What's wrong?

563
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,545
It's--It's the one
you wanted.

564
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,345
Mr. Parrish,
I can't take this.

565
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,248
Sure you can,Jake.

566
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,321
My parents won't let me.

567
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,855
I'd better be
gettin' back home now.

568
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,359
You sure?

569
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:41,329
Yeah. Thanks anyway,
Mr. Parrish.

570
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,297
Okay, see you
around the store.

571
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,299
Jake: Okay.

572
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:48,529
Hey,Jake.

573
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:49,935
The name's Sy.

574
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,507
Okay, Sy.

575
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,012
Well, there's--

576
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,248
There's been, like,
some kind of shift.

577
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:43,817
I don't know.
A couple of weeks.

578
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,557
Maybe five weeks.

579
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:53,661
Six. No, I know that, but...

580
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:58,036
[Chuckles]
Um, yeah, but this--

581
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:01,338
This feels different,
you know?

582
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,345
[Sighs]
Listen,Jan...

583
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,007
I can't talk right now.
[Sighs]

584
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,880
I'll call you back
this afternoon.

585
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:13,048
Okay. I know.
I love you, too. Bye.

586
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,060
Hi, Sy.

587
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:21,393
Hi there.

588
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:22,557
I was just
at the Dairy Queen.

589
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:23,565
I saw you down here

590
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,067
and thought
I'd say hello.

591
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:28,400
I'm just grabbing
some shopping fuel.

592
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,564
I never see you
away from the store.

593
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,074
After all these years,
you'd think

594
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,938
we'd run into each other
at some point.

595
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,478
Why, do you live
around here?

596
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,274
I live downtown.

597
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:40,282
Mmm. Well,
that's quite a drive.

598
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,011
No, I'm used to it.

599
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,248
You have
a nice boy there.

600
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:52,193
Oh,Jake. Yeah.

601
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,787
A little sensitive,
maybe, but, um...

602
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,457
- he likes you, Sy.
- Aw.

603
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,626
He calls you
"Sy the photo guy."

604
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,169
You know,
I've watched him grow

605
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:01,738
since he was this big.

606
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,033
That's right.

607
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,007
You've been doing our pictures
for a long time.

608
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:10,240
You know, I almost feel
like "Uncle Sy."

609
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:15,380
[Chuckles]
Well, I've got some

610
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,283
serious shopping
to do, Sy.

611
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,652
Oh, sure.

612
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:24,451
Take care.

613
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,690
Oh, my God.

614
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,858
What?

615
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:34,165
That's so weird.
l--l--I'm--

616
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,569
I'm reading that exact
book right now.

617
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,232
You're kidding.

618
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,369
No. I can't believe that
you'd be reading that book.

619
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,674
You know, he writes a lot

620
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,579
about noticing coincidence,
doesn't he?

621
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,777
Yeah, he does.

622
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,820
That thing he says
about fear--

623
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:53,087
Oh.

624
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,887
"The things we fear
the most

625
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,930
have already
happened to us."

626
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,427
Wow.

627
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:08,027
I had no idea you were
such a deep thinker, Sy.

628
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:13,200
[Chuckles]
I wouldn't say that.

629
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,972
Do you have
any children, Sy?

630
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,675
Me? No. No.
I'm not married.

631
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,149
No girlfriend?

632
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,150
No.

633
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,455
I have a snapshot
of my mother, though.

634
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,488
Hmm.

635
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,871
She looks very nice.

636
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,473
She's passed away.

637
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:49,909
Oh. Well, um...

638
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:50,946
I'm sorry, Sy.

639
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,916
Gosh, you know,
I have to go.

640
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,718
Um, it was really nice
chatting with you.

641
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,952
It was nice
chatting with you.

642
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,027
Um...

643
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,891
I'll probably
see you very soon.

644
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:06,985
We can't seem to go a day

645
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,792
without taking a picture
of something, so--

646
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,816
Sy Parrish,
please see the manager.

647
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,219
Sy to the manager's office
immediately, please.

648
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,427
What's with the getup, Sy?

649
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:22,698
Sy: It's Wednesday,
Bill.

650
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,433
I was doin' the SRS.

651
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:27,703
Sy, there's been some
discrepancies

652
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:28,743
in the click count.

653
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:32,179
Oh, well,
that's probably Yoshi.

654
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,648
You know, his math skills
are pretty weak...

655
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:34,649
but I told you about that

656
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:35,844
when you moved him over
from audio.

657
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:36,942
No, all the discrepancies

658
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,783
are on the logs
that you initialed.

659
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,618
- They are?
- Yeah.

660
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,952
Oh. l, you know...

661
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,459
I guess sometimes
the end of the week

662
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,756
you get
a little tired--

663
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,229
We're not talking about
a few innocent math errors, Sy.

664
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:52,166
The net clicks all zero out.
They always zero out.

665
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,100
The problem is, Sy,
that the shutdown clicks

666
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,227
don't correspond at all.

667
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:57,500
I mean, they don't even
come close to matching

668
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,905
the amount of prints
that we sold.

669
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,671
Well, then,
it's probably a problem

670
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,109
with the reorder
counter.

671
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,875
Well, I asked Larry
about that.

672
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,143
What did he say?

673
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,219
Well, he looked
at the counter

674
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,185
and said that
it checked out.

675
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:14,189
He also said that
in 14 years of servicing...

676
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,782
he's never seen a faulty
counter on an AGFA unit.

677
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,657
Really?

678
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:19,786
So the question is, Sy...

679
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:22,297
where did all those
unaccounted for prints go?

680
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:24,094
Well, what kind
of discrepancy

681
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,259
are we talking
about, Bill?

682
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:27,927
We're talking about
hundreds of prints, Sy.

683
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:29,699
[Chuckles]
Oh!

684
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,399
That's not possible,
Bill.

685
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,066
Oh, no.
I've done the math...

686
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,336
and the P.O.s
confirm it, too.

687
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:36,776
Well, I don't know
anything about it.

688
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,280
Oh, I think you do, Sy.

689
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,184
Well, I don't, Bill.

690
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,518
Look, Sy,
I've got a family.

691
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,354
I'm not losing my job
over this.

692
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,692
I'm lettin' you go.

693
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,698
No.

694
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,797
Oh.

695
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,100
[Sighs]

696
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,845
These log discrepancies
would be enough...

697
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:11,471
but you've been
spacing out on the job...

698
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:12,843
taking 90 minute
lunch breaks...

699
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,510
creating scenes in front
of the customers...

700
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:17,314
giving away free merchandise.

701
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:18,615
What?

702
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:21,122
Free disposable cameras
to customers on their birthday?

703
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,193
That must have been
your bright idea.

704
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:24,726
Sure as shit
isn't company policy.

705
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:25,726
You can't do this.

706
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,160
It's done, Sy.

707
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:29,232
I talked to Sims
at district.

708
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,200
Now you finish out the week
and clear out your locker.

709
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,133
And if you do somethin'
like fuck up today's prints--

710
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:36,706
I haven't fucked up
a customer's prints

711
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:39,401
in 11 years.

712
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:42,137
Just get back out there.

713
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,666
Nina: Hey, Sy.

714
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:40,696
Sy.

715
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,308
Jake wanted to get his
birthday gift processed.

716
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,479
I'm sorry?

717
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,776
The camera.

718
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,587
Right. The birthday gift.

719
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,055
Number of sets?

720
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:07,425
Oh, just one is fine.

721
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,402
4x6? 5x7?

722
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:15,961
Um, the ones
we usually get.

723
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:18,132
Standard.

724
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,300
Jake had a really great
time with the camera.

725
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,342
Didn't you,Jake?

726
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,913
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

727
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:31,620
What was that
address again?

728
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:36,989
It's 326 Serrano Terrace.

729
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:40,526
Sy, are you all right?

730
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,893
I'm fine.

731
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,463
I'll have these
for you tomorrow.

732
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,804
All right. Thanks, Sy.

733
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:51,897
Bye.

734
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,535
Bye.

737
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:02,989
Oh.

738
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:06,246
I'm leaving early
today, Yoshi.

739
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:08,221
Okay, Sy.

740
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:12,252
I won't be
coming back, Yoshi.

741
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:13,761
Bill let me go.

742
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:17,400
You were fired?

743
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:18,866
Yep.

744
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:19,867
Really?

745
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,301
Really.

746
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:23,304
Wow.

747
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:29,712
I've really enjoyed
working with you, Yoshi.

748
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,280
Yeah, me, too, Sy.

749
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:36,378
Sy?

750
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,647
Sy, I just wanted to, um...

751
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,622
well, I guess I just wanted
to say thank you, you know?

752
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:43,989
For what?

753
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:46,619
For teachin' me
all this stuff.

754
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,756
You're welcome, Yoshi.

755
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:52,858
Don't let the place
go downhill, okay?

756
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,163
I won't, Sy.

757
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:20,815
Here they are.

758
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,477
Oh, my pictures.
Let me see. Let me see.

[Starts Car]

760
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:37,280
Come on.

761
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:45,453
What the hell's
wrong with these people?

762
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:10,579
Michael Rennie On TV:
The universe grows smaller

763
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:12,587
every day.

764
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,919
There must be security
for all...

765
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:16,821
or no one is secure.

766
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:22,759
It is no concern of ours
how you run your own planet.

767
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:25,835
But if you threaten
to extend your violence...

768
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,267
this earth of yours
will be reduced

769
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:30,100
to a burned-out cinder.

770
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:36,206
Now, we do not pretend
to have achieved perfection.

771
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,782
But we do have a system,
and it works.

772
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:43,916
Your choice is simple:

773
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,420
join us and live in peace

774
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:51,551
or pursue your present course
and face obliteration.

775
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:54,755
We shall be waiting
for your answer.

776
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:58,765
The decision rests with you.

777
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:40,673
Aah!

778
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:41,869
Ah!

[Breathing Heavily]

780
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:49,700
Sy: According to
the Oxford English Dictionary...

781
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:53,145
the word "snapshot"
was first used in 1808

782
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:57,151
by an English sportsman by
the name of Sir Andrew Hawker.

783
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:58,811
He noted in his diary

784
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:01,412
that almost every bird
he shot that day

785
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:04,049
was taken by snapshot...

786
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,154
meaning a hurried shot
taken without deliberate aim.

[Click Click Click Click]

788
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,200
Can I help you,
Sy?

789
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,241
Just dropping off
some film.

790
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:56,140
Just a customer.

791
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:58,236
I can still shop here,
can't l, Bill?

792
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,246
No, Sy, you can't
still shop here.

793
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:01,748
- I believe I can, Bill.
- Shh.

794
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:03,682
[Raises Voice]
There's no law that says

795
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:06,346
I can't shop here
just because I was fired.

796
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:07,423
I checked it out.

797
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:08,421
There's a thousand
other places

798
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:09,752
you could do
your photos.

799
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:11,986
There's no reason to come
all the way down here

800
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:13,562
other than
to fuck with me.

801
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:15,255
There's
a very good reason.

802
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:17,355
I calibrated that machine
personally.

803
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,628
It's the best mini-lab
in the state.

804
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:25,105
All right, Sy.
Just this one time.

805
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:26,607
But I'm telling you...

806
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:28,438
find another place
to do your film.

807
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,375
I do not want you
back in here.

01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,845
Thanks, Bill.

809
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,585
What is it, Yoshi?
You can't just

810
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:19,558
leave your station
unmanned down there.

811
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:21,596
I think you need
to see these, sir.

812
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:22,925
What have you got
there?

813
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:24,727
Is it the anal sex
fiend again?

Motherfucker.

815
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:30,192
What would you say

816
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:33,393
Mr. Parrish's demeanor
was when he came in?

817
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:34,526
Demeanor?

818
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:36,195
Yeah. How did he seem?

819
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:39,274
Did he seem upset
or agitated in any way?

820
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:42,105
Um...I don't know.
He seemed fine.

821
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,202
Sy and I had some words
when he came into the store.

822
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:46,838
Under the circumstances,
I was surprised to see him...

823
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,349
and I asked him
what he was doing here...

824
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:51,579
and I...I suggested
in strong language

825
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:52,915
that in the future

826
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:54,922
he bring his pictures
somewhere else.

827
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,252
Yoshi, I'm gonna
need to make

828
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:57,883
some Xerox copies
of this.

829
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:59,928
Can you show me where
I can get that done?

830
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,053
Yeah.

831
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:04,291
Mr. Owens, why don't you
come and grab a seat

832
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,890
and try to calm down?

833
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:12,873
Your wife and child,
they're, uh...

834
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:14,272
they're somewhere
safe now?

Uh...they're
at my mother's.

836
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:19,273
I'm--I'm sorry.
I'm just a little upset.

837
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:21,646
No, no, no, no.
I understand. It's...

838
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,343
It's understandable.

839
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,943
So how did he take
his being fired?

840
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:28,751
I've had to fire
a lot of people, Detective.

841
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:31,088
People get upset
when they get fired.

842
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:33,218
He got pretty upset.

843
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:35,092
He knew that Mr. Araki
would see the photos...

844
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:36,755
and he knew
he'd show them to you

845
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:38,026
and that
you'd call us.

846
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:39,362
I think
it's just a warning.

847
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:41,402
But you have to
take it seriously.

848
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:43,699
Oh, we take it
very seriously.

I've got plainclothes
officers on standby

855
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,146
inside the store and out.
Now, look...

856
01:05:57,253 --> 01:05:58,777
he may come back
and pick up his photos.

857
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:00,651
He may not.
It's hard to say.

858
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:02,246
I doubt he will.

859
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:04,258
You really think
that's a good idea?

860
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,351
I mean, this place
is wall-to-wall families.

861
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:09,124
If he's stupid enough
to come back here...

862
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:11,597
he'll never make it
inside the store.

I'll be the one asking
the questions here, Sy.

I know.
Just one question.

Detective,
are you a family man?

01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:33,762
That's none of your
business, Sy.

Sir, you're right,
it isn't.

It is none
of my business.

that you are...

and that makes you
a very fortunate man.

I can also tell by the way
that you've treated me so far
