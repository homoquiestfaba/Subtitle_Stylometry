1
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,013
Miss, you okay?

2
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,710
<i>I can't remember when I had my first
waking nightmare.</i>

3
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,787
<i>They're too disturbing to call daydreams.</i>

4
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,690
<i>I never talked about them with anyone.</i>

5
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,998
<i>They never made any sense to me...</i>

6
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,226
<i>then I found the Pathway.</i>

7
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,466
<i>Now they're all clear, every one of them.</i>

8
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,318
Breakfast of champions.

9
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,216
When was the last time you slept?

10
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,259
<i>I'm happy I can stand, man.
I'm on a three-day rage.</i>

11
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,886
Your father will kick your ass
if you flunk anything.

12
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,294
Since when did he need an excuse
to do that?

13
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,866
<i>At least you're out of the house.</i>

14
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,663
<i>Hey, I'd trade places with you any day.</i>

15
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,131
- What up, Jake?
- Darius.

16
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,400
<i>What's up?</i>

17
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,475
So you playing ball next year?

18
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,244
<i>- I don't know, man.
- Get with it.</i>

19
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,111
<i>That's what you said last term, dawg.</i>

20
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,980
<i>Man, the guys around the gym,
they tell me you're the real deal.</i>

21
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,618
<i>- What are you staring at?
- It ain't your truck, homey.</i>

22
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,300
<i>- Easy.
- What's he got there, Jake?</i>

23
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,664
- Nothing, man.
- Bullshit.

24
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,862
Let it go.

25
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,695
- Just keep your dog on a leash.
- All right.

26
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,946
What the fuck were you gonna do,
shoot him?

27
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,040
Chill. It only told me to scare him.

28
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,279
<i>"It"? What is "it"?</i>

29
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,185
Just give me back the piece.

30
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,656
No, man, no. Are you crazy?
What, do you want to get arrested?

31
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,451
Where did you get this?

32
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,422
Later.

33
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,555
Happy birthday.

34
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,203
Joseph Campbell believed
that the power of myth...

35
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:23,635
related to certain intrinsic universal values
found in all cultures:

36
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,144
The need to worship God,
to protect the family...

37
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,740
to coexist in harmony with nature.

38
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,915
Now, from these very ideas
stories were created...

39
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,648
and passed down
from one generation to another...

40
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,316
each having its own central hero character.

41
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,422
Want to see what you missed?

42
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,326
<i>If I wanted to see it,
I wouldn't have missed it.</i>

43
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,032
Campbell termed this ennobled path...

44
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,832
- Just trying to be helpful.
- What a shame.

45
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,264
I thought you wanted to get in my pants.

46
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,078
It is my birthday.

47
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,480
Works for me.

48
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,589
But little more than the stories
we grow up hearing...

49
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,453
and the tradition of telling them...

50
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:16,289
is what binds together
even the most disparate of societies.

51
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,595
Happy birthday, handsome.

52
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:26,663
<i>- How does it feel to be 21?
- Like I'm on the verge of nothing.</i>

53
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:30,208
Mr. Gray, am I interrupting a celebration?

54
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,501
Sorry, Prof. Hartney.

55
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:37,010
Tell me, Dakota, what are we to make
of this Dionysian offering?

56
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,447
Mimosas.

57
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:49,389
<i>All right. That's enough for today.
Thank you.</i>

58
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:57,562
<i>- So we drinking this tonight?
- We'll be doing a lot more than that.</i>

59
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,534
Dakota.

60
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,135
In my office in 30 minutes.

61
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,178
Get me out of this town.

62
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,342
You must be Jake.

63
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,910
Yeah. How did you know that?

64
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,441
Hey, Jake, this lady needs help
with her laptop, okay?

65
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,121
<i>Okay. What's the problem?</i>

66
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,387
It just stopped working.

67
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,688
They do that.

68
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,132
<i>Okay, let's see.</i>

69
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:41,031
<i>- That's what it looks like in there.
- What did you expect?</i>

70
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,371
Lots of little guys running around
doing my errands for me.

71
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,874
Okay.

72
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,955
<i>You've got some red wax.</i>

73
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,590
Wax. My tarot cards.

74
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:05,195
<i>- Sorry?
- I burn candles when I read tarot, so...</i>

75
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,966
They help you see into the future, right?

76
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,762
Yeah, and the past.

77
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,030
Okay.

78
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,066
It works.

79
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,380
- What do I owe you?
- No charge.

80
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,018
- Really?
- Yeah.

81
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,481
<i>That's so nice. Thank you.</i>

82
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,380
Jake.

83
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,827
You could have got $75 for that job.

84
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,796
- It was a piece of wax.
- Yeah?

85
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,762
<i>Well, I'm docking your salary.</i>

86
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,960
What the hell for?

87
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,005
Because your time is my money.

88
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,270
And please, watch your fucking language.

89
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,750
<i>Aren't you going to blow it out?</i>

90
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,052
<i>Are you going to sing me "Happy Birthday"?</i>

91
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,595
I stopped singing the day
they kicked me out of the church choir.

92
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,432
Did you go see your mother?

93
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,801
<i>No. She wasn't feeling well today,
so I'll go see her tomorrow.</i>

94
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,401
How are things going at the mill?

95
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,075
Still got a job.

96
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,075
<i>They'd have to close the place down
if they got rid of you.</i>

97
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,480
Thanks.

98
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,951
You going out tonight
with Conrad and Dakota?

99
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,821
<i>I'm legal.</i>

100
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,891
They look up to you, Jake.

101
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,863
<i>But they're still caught in the rain.</i>

102
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,771
What does that mean?

103
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,540
<i>Don't get wet.</i>

104
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,410
<i>Ludes? X? What's your poison, lover boy?</i>

105
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,641
<i>- Are you peaking or crying?
- I've had better days, Jake.</i>

106
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,115
- So what happened?
- Hartney hit on me again.

107
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,382
- What did he say?
- Fuck or fail.

108
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,156
<i>That's got a nice ring to it.</i>

109
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:22,387
Well, I ran out of the office.
I bought myself a few days.

110
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,894
<i>Why don't you report him?
He does this all the time.</i>

111
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,727
<i>- Dean Glick won't do anything.
- Why not?</i>

112
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,460
<i>I'll give you one guess.</i>

113
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,900
Come on, huh?

114
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,735
Shit.

115
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,283
<i>Fuck. I'll fucking nail both of you, man?</i>

116
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,060
<i>- I didn't call for back up.
- You're welcome.</i>

117
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,556
So, Valerie Gaines, behind the gym...

118
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,502
senior prom.

119
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:08,136
You guys thought that we were
powdering our noses.

120
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,299
Her nose was up my skirt.

121
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,308
Man!

122
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,408
<i>Jake, what's our zip code?</i>

123
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,676
98133.

124
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,879
Had you heard that one?

125
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,252
Personally, I found it depressing.

126
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,919
<i>That's just because you weren't there.</i>

127
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,393
Exactly. What year were you born?

128
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,054
Same as you, dumb-ass.

129
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,732
<i>So what's your weirdest family holiday?</i>

130
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,363
<i>Fuck that. We'll be here all night.</i>

131
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:43,831
What was your weirdest family holiday?

132
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,505
Thanksgiving, a couple years ago.

133
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,144
<i>I was building a ramp
for my mom's wheelchair...</i>

134
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,613
and Father Moore came by to visit.

135
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:01,484
They were all inside watching football,
Dallas-Tampa game. Dallas lost.

136
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,391
That was your weirdest family holiday?

137
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,694
So I had a hammer in my hand...

138
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,635
and I look up
and Father Moore was smiling at me...

139
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,965
and all I could think about
is just bashing his head in.

140
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,602
<i>Over and over,
and then I'd smash my parents' heads in.</i>

141
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,006
<i>Then, like, half the people I knew, just...</i>

142
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:29,279
So then I started thinking,
what else would I like to do?

143
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,590
And all this crazy shit came into my head.

144
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,754
So then what happened?

145
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,397
I finished the ramp, and we ate turkey.

146
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,270
<i>Dude, that's sick even for me.</i>

147
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,840
<i>Dude, I've castrated my dad
112 times in my dreams.</i>

148
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,037
Three of a kind, huh?

149
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,707
<i>Let's play a real fucked-up game.</i>

150
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,394
<i>"Welcome to The Pathway. "</i>

151
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,360
The Pathway.

152
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,905
<i>I've never played this before.</i>

153
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,467
<i>Dakota, it's a secret.</i>

154
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,536
<i>Well, it's not a very good secret
if you know about it.</i>

155
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,337
Serious.

156
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,939
You give it your phone numbers and stuff...

157
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,581
then it calls you
and gives you bizarre things to do.

158
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,551
What kind of bizarre things?

159
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,921
<i>Well, you don't know unless you play.</i>

160
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,385
- How do you start?
- You already have.

161
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,188
Happy birthday.

162
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,564
<i>Oh, shit. It's, like, my entire life.</i>

163
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,402
Wild or what?

164
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,640
<i>Dude, you'll never be President.</i>

165
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,340
Turn this off.
Somebody could be reading this.

166
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,942
Nobody cares about the $243
you got left in your bank account.

167
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,315
Abort.

168
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,446
Fuck!

169
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,419
<i>God, I'm so drunk.</i>

170
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,763
I need another drink.

171
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,593
Oh, body shots.

172
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,268
<i>- I'll be down in a minute.
- Enjoy.</i>

173
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,497
What are you doing?

174
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,948
Your charity case dropped that off for you.

175
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,455
Did she leave a number?

176
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,690
What do I look like, a secretary?

177
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,671
<i>By the way, you're fired.</i>

178
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,038
Yeah, right. I was 10 minutes late.

179
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,236
Look, my nephew got out of rehab,
all right. He needs a job.

180
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,506
<i>- So do I.
- Oh, I don't know.</i>

181
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:19,477
Sell pot like my nephew did.
He made a killing before he got busted.

182
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,119
I need the keys.

183
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,753
<i>You've got to be kidding me.</i>

184
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,658
You know, you owe me two weeks pay.

185
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,429
Sue me.

186
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,263
<i>Son of a...</i>

187
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,351
What?

188
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,546
<i>Your boss fires you
and all you do is hit a desk?</i>

189
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,082
Who is this?

190
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:02,550
<i>I know what the voices in your head
really tell you to do.</i>

191
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,255
<i>I don't know who this is.
I don't have time to play games.</i>

192
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,229
<i>You wouldn't have let Conrad sign you on...</i>

193
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,301
<i>if you weren't looking for a distraction
from your dreary world.</i>

194
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,664
Happy birthday.

195
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,003
This is the Pathway?

196
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,510
<i>Today we find a way to get even
with an asshole of your choosing.</i>

197
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,842
<i>- Have anybody in mind?
- My boss.</i>

198
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,008
<i>- What would you like to do to him?
- Kill him.</i>

199
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,109
<i>You'd only be doing him a favor.</i>

200
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,253
<i>Enjoy your first day off...</i>

201
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,690
<i>then come back tomorrow
and see what the Pathway does for you.</i>

202
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,550
Somebody order an orchid?

203
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,153
<i>Don't expect a tip.</i>

204
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,232
So you been thinking about me?

205
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,139
Only between my dance classes.

206
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,103
<i>- How are you doing?
- I'm good.</i>

207
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,612
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

208
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,710
<i>How's your job going?</i>

209
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,477
<i>It's going great.</i>

210
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,646
You and your dad getting along?

211
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,191
Yeah, like family.

212
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,460
That bad, huh?

213
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,329
Maybe I should move back home.

214
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,225
This place is breaking us.

215
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:54,605
<i>No. There'd be no one
to look after you all day.</i>

216
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,537
Dad and I are fine.

217
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:04,105
You were always such a terrible liar.

218
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,519
<i>Where's your blanket?
I'm going to get you a blanket. Hang on.</i>

219
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,646
<i>Excuse me, nurse.
Can we get a blanket for my...</i>

220
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,351
- Marisol.
- Jake.

221
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,123
What are you doing here?

222
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:21,759
You two know each other?

223
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,231
Yeah, she came into the computer shop.

224
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,098
Jake saved my life.

225
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:29,031
It was just a circuit board.

226
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,844
<i>So you're the one
that brings Kathy the orchids?</i>

227
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,003
Yeah.

228
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:43,914
<i>- You wanted a blanket. I'll get you blanket.
- Thanks for the cards.</i>

229
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,417
<i>- You're welcome.
- Small world, huh?</i>

230
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,458
Yeah. I like it that way, though.

231
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,696
Behave, Mom.

232
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,859
Why should I start now?

233
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,479
<i>There he is. That's the kid that robbed me.</i>

234
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,717
- Arrest him.
- Take it easy.

235
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:26,230
No. I fired this kid yesterday.
He comes back last night and rips me off.

236
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:29,393
I just came by to get my money.
He owes me two weeks pay.

237
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,594
- Were you in here last night?
- No.

238
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,293
Okay. All right. You know what?

239
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:36,932
<i>Let's check out the hidden surveillance
cameras and we'll see what we see.</i>

240
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,942
<i>Didn't know we had those, did you, Jake?</i>

241
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:42,411
<i>I'm just going to start this
from when I left here last night.</i>

242
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:48,883
<i>What the...</i>

243
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,624
<i>That can't be me.</i>

244
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,490
You doctored the tape.

245
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,901
<i>You little prick. Don't you see?</i>

246
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:07,603
<i>He's goddamn smart.</i>

247
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,464
God, you screwed me, Gray!

248
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:12,065
<i>How'd you do it, huh?</i>

249
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:18,239
So then who were those guys
on the videotape?

250
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,547
<i>I don't know. That's why I'm trying
to hack into the site.</i>

251
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:25,655
<i>Well, whoever they are,
I wouldn't piss them off.</i>

252
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:26,815
Yeah.

253
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,383
Shit.

254
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,688
Since when are you into voodoo?

255
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:37,131
<i>They're spiritual interpretations
of universal ideas.</i>

256
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,772
<i>That's what it said on the box.</i>

257
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,902
So what did it have to say
about these guys?

258
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:57,216
<i>"The figures suggest youth,
love, and virginity...</i>

259
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,586
<i>"before they're corrupted by desire. "</i>

260
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,762
Remember taking my virginity?

261
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,865
If I recall, I think it was you that took mine.

262
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:17,533
Details.

263
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,314
Should we light a candle or something?

264
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,468
So much for cuddling.

265
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,549
Well, Jake, you got what you wanted...

266
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,916
and I get to keep playing the Pathway.

267
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,049
You just made love to me
because the Pathway told you to?

268
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:43,150
No, Jake, I fucked you
because the Pathway told me to.

269
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,728
When did you start playing the Pathway?

270
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,157
Like you care.

271
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:54,668
<i>Like you've ever really given a shit
about me, Jake.</i>

272
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,199
Like any man ever has.

273
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,610
See you on campus.

274
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,461
Hello.

275
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,431
<i>Feeling distracted?</i>

276
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,196
Beats watching TV.

277
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,609
<i>Are you ready for another test?</i>

278
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,169
<i>I thought that was Dakota's test.</i>

279
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,474
<i>Besides, it's not exactly our first time.</i>

280
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,379
<i>With her in control it was.</i>

281
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,343
I thought the point was to entertain me.

282
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:18,445
<i>No, the point was to see
what's inside your head.</i>

283
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:46,653
<i>Dinner's ready.</i>

284
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,058
Trying to break my hand?

285
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,193
<i>What's the matter, you pull something?</i>

286
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,092
Just throw the goddamn ball.

287
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,773
Let me see.

288
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,184
- Darius do that?
- With a little help.

289
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:47,656
<i>Damn it, Connie, I can't baby-sit you
day and night.</i>

290
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,251
Who asked you to?

291
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:54,356
<i>Don't give me that shit. I've been covering
your back since we were nine.</i>

292
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,524
<i>Why don't you stop already?</i>

293
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:58,862
Okay.

294
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,361
Sorry, man.

295
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,631
<i>I think I'm building up a resistance
to my medication.</i>

296
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,641
<i>Yeah, I think we're both losing it.</i>

297
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:12,182
<i>Listen to this shit.
The other night, I'm down in the basement.</i>

298
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,215
I get a phone call from the Pathway.

299
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:17,116
<i>I turn around.
There's a big creature staring at me.</i>

300
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,552
A creature.

301
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,314
Half man, half woman.

302
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,821
Anyway, I have this dream
where I go upstairs...

303
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,553
and I shoot my dad in the back of the head.

304
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,062
Has trippy stuff like that
been happening to you?

305
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,896
Every goddamn day.

306
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,535
Great.

307
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:41,240
<i>- I'll take it easy on you.
- Right.</i>

308
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,618
<i>- Hello.
- Jakey.</i>

309
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,222
Got two girls in my room.

310
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,530
<i>- I can't get them to leave.
- Nice, man.</i>

311
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,824
<i>Why didn't you give me a shout?</i>

312
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,562
<i>Yeah, like I'm going to have you by.</i>

313
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,299
They would have taken one look at you
and kicked my ass out of bed.

314
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,971
Is something wrong?

315
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,046
<i>I don't know, man. I'm spent. You know?</i>

316
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,545
All right, dude. Be careful.

317
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,585
<i>Why don't we get breakfast in the morning?</i>

318
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,211
<i>Okay. I'll call you in the morning.</i>

319
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,222
<i>- Hey, Jake.
- Yeah.</i>

320
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:28,684
Fuck you.

321
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,941
Dude, what the fuck do you want now?

322
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,913
<i>Nobody knows how fucked up
you really are.</i>

323
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,913
<i>And nobody really gives a fuck, do they?</i>

324
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,154
What the fuck!

325
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,029
Connie.

326
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,808
<i>Connie, let's go get some breakfast, bud.</i>

327
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,139
Or more like lunch.

328
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:33,945
Connie, wake up.

329
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,337
Uncle Ross.

330
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:19,022
<i>He didn't sound good.
I should have come over.</i>

331
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,552
You could have wound up dead, too.

332
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:26,927
<i>Conrad wasn't a psychopath.</i>

333
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:30,625
He was always on the edge. This thing
with Darius just pushed him over it.

334
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:34,501
<i>No. Those guys would fight one day,
and then they'd get high the next.</i>

335
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:37,797
<i>I'm sure their parents will be comforted
to hear that.</i>

336
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,003
Did you help Conrad steal that gun?

337
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:43,038
What?

338
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:47,174
<i>The serial numbers matched a. 38
stolen from Sid's Sporting Goods last week.</i>

339
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,156
<i>- That's impossible.
- Why is that?</i>

340
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:57,657
- Because I threw that gun into Cove Lake.
- You what?

341
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,094
<i>I took a gun from Connie...</i>

342
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:03,266
<i>I didn't want him to get in trouble,
so I threw it in the lake.</i>

343
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:05,198
How would Conrad
have gotten the gun back?

344
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:06,894
<i>He couldn't have.</i>

345
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,733
This is a bad time to start lying to me.

346
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:09,999
<i>I'm not lying to you.</i>

347
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:13,235
<i>You think I don't want to find out
what went on in there?</i>

348
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,270
You going to tell my sister or am I?

349
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,148
Yeah, I want to go to the hospital now,
if I can.

350
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:34,158
<i>You know, I'm your uncle.</i>

351
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,929
You could have brought the gun to me.

352
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,623
Are you okay?

353
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,764
<i>It's the worst day of my life.</i>

354
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,130
You want to talk about it?

355
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,497
Not here.

356
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,663
Meet me in front in five minutes.

357
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:50,540
Okay?

358
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:54,501
Okay.

359
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,775
<i>I just don't want to end up like my father.</i>

360
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:06,548
Go to work at 6:00, come home at 8:00.
Do it all over again the next day.

361
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,284
What do you want to do?

362
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,824
- I wish I knew.
- Have you ever thought about leaving here?

363
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,822
<i>- Who'd bring my mom orchids?
- I'm sure she would love postcards.</i>

364
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,502
Looks like you like to travel.

365
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,141
Yeah.

366
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,406
I like collecting things.

367
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,908
- How did you end up here?
- A man.

368
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,611
<i>Sorry, I didn't mean to pry.</i>

369
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,688
<i>No, it's okay.
I'm just enjoying this one too much.</i>

370
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,963
So how about you?
Are you seeing anybody?

371
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:51,526
Took you long enough to ask.

372
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:55,595
- I take that as a no.
- No.

373
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:01,944
<i>But who knows, I could always
run into someone when I'm not expecting it.</i>

374
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,576
That never happens.

375
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:11,514
What timing. All I want to do
is leave this town, and you just got here.

376
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,781
We just have to meet somewhere
in the middle.

377
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:17,985
Okay.

378
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,924
Well, you were right. The day did get better.

379
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,936
<i>I'm sorry about your friend.</i>

380
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:46,386
<i>So I'm going to try to play it cool
and not call you for at least an hour, okay?</i>

381
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,593
Okay. Bye, Jake.

382
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,053
Bye.

383
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:19,388
I remember when you and Connie
first met in Sunday school.

384
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:23,951
<i>You're drinking?</i>

385
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:27,053
<i>Well, I'm not praying.</i>

386
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:31,133
<i>You're going to throw away five years
just like that?</i>

387
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:35,601
<i>You think I don't know what you and Conrad
have been doing to yourselves, Son?</i>

388
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:37,003
<i>You think I don't know that?</i>

389
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,268
What Conrad did has nothing to do with me.

390
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,003
<i>He's gone to hell.</i>

391
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,815
<i>I don't have to listen to this.</i>

392
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:49,183
Wait just a minute, Jake.
Wait a minute. Wait.

393
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:57,318
<i>We're not going to be able to save you now.</i>

394
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,896
<i>Don't preach to me
with a drink in your hand, Dad.</i>

395
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:02,625
You ungrateful punk.

396
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,296
You realize that we have sacrificed
everything for you here?

397
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:11,069
Sacrificed? You sacrificed?

398
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,709
<i>I could've gone anywhere,
I could've done anything...</i>

399
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:17,042
but I stayed here for you,
I stayed here for Mom.

400
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,206
What did you ever give up for me?

401
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:22,417
My beautiful wife.

402
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,248
What does that mean?

403
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:29,888
<i>- I thought I could do this, but I can't.
- Thought you could do what?</i>

404
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:33,292
<i>What are you trying to tell me?
You're blaming me for the way Mom is...</i>

405
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,831
<i>for the accident?
You're gonna blame me for that now?</i>

406
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:40,131
<i>The day after my best friend kills himself,
you're gonna blame me for that?</i>

407
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:43,462
<i>It's not very much, though, Jake.</i>

408
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:51,908
The day I need you the most, the day
I need help, the day I need my father...

409
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:54,314
you do this?

410
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,388
Shame on you.

411
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:01,749
Jake?

412
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,098
<i>I don't know whether to cry or scream.</i>

413
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,231
I know what you mean.

414
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:20,674
You know, I called you six times.

415
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,548
<i>I'm really sorry about what happened
the other night.</i>

416
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,339
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

417
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:39,719
<i>- So why didn't you call me back?
- I was hanging out with a friend.</i>

418
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:42,725
Who is she?

419
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,761
Her name is Marisol.

420
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:49,498
<i>- Sounds exotic.
- She's different.</i>

421
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:51,732
<i>- I'm super late.
- Dakota, hey.</i>

422
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,970
You heard what Conrad
did to himself, right?

423
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,244
<i>Can't stop thinking about it.</i>

424
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,649
Well, the other night,
after I got off the phone with the Pathway...

425
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:07,087
I had a dream
where I did the same thing to myself.

426
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,626
You think that the Pathway has something
to do with what Conrad did to himself?

427
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:15,755
Yeah, maybe. Are you still playing?

428
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:19,402
<i>It hasn't asked me to corrupt anyone else,
if that's what you're asking.</i>

429
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,993
All right. Do me a favor.

430
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,662
- Anything.
- Stop.

431
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,302
Sure.

432
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,071
<i>Come by the Tomahawk tonight.
Dinner's on me.</i>

433
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,382
And bring your friend.

434
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,818
You sure you want company tonight?

435
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:47,856
- No, but I like being with you.
- Good.

436
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,969
<i>Okay, now I'm jealous.</i>

437
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:59,898
- Marisol, this is Dakota.
- Nice to meet you.

438
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,808
<i>- God, Marisol. That's such a beautiful name.
- Thank you.</i>

439
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,905
<i>- What does it mean?
- It's Spanish for "sun and sea. "</i>

440
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:09,381
Oh, my parents named me
for where I was conceived.

441
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,295
I would really love to stay here
and chat with you guys...

442
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,661
but my boss is totally riding my ass.

443
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:25,501
<i>It's okay. We're just going to do take-out.</i>

444
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:27,661
So two burgers, two fries, and two beers.

445
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:30,706
<i>- We're not staying?
- No. I got a surprise for you.</i>

446
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:36,241
Now this would be the part where I get ill.

447
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:46,779
<i>Sorry. Looking for the men's room.</i>

448
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:55,122
<i>You know where the men's room is,
Professor. You eat here twice a week.</i>

449
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:58,668
So, have you thought about
our little conversation after class?

450
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:08,173
<i>Professor, you twist that ring any harder,
and your finger's going to come off.</i>

451
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,642
<i>I've got plenty more.</i>

452
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:13,142
Asshole!

453
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:30,964
<i>- Tomahawk.
- Even Hartney knows you are weak.</i>

454
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,065
<i>Every man does.</i>

455
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:37,772
<i>Why do you think Jake would never
be with you for more than one night?</i>

456
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,708
<i>He knows you've fucked all his friends.</i>

457
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,207
<i>Who wants a girl like that?</i>

458
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:49,242
<i>I know. It wasn't your fault.</i>

459
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:51,680
<i>Daddy was a monster.</i>

460
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,881
<i>But then, let's face it.</i>

461
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,483
<i>Lots of girls have bad fathers,
and they don't end up like you.</i>

462
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:59,891
<i>Get used to it.</i>

463
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,122
<i>You let Hartney fuck you over...</i>

464
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:06,828
<i>and you're going to be working in dumps
like this for the rest of your miserable life.</i>

465
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:10,335
<i>- Is that what you want?
- Fuck you.</i>

466
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,141
Fuck all of you!

467
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:17,640
<i>That's my girl. Didn't that feel good?</i>

468
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:21,048
<i>Don't you understand
that I want to help you...</i>

469
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,348
<i>make you feel better...</i>

470
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,751
<i>help you get even with Hartney
before it's too late.</i>

471
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:28,952
Yes.

472
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,954
<i>Don't be afraid. It's time to play.</i>

473
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,539
When I was nine months old,
my folks moved here from Seattle...

474
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,074
<i>to be near my uncle, my mother's brother.</i>

475
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:49,107
There was a blizzard
and my dad lost control of the car.

476
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,373
It was a miracle any of us survived.

477
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:54,139
<i>There's a higher power looking out for you.</i>

478
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,021
Is she okay?

479
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:06,324
<i>- I'll call her later. We are late.
- Late for what?</i>

480
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:28,979
<i>It's so worth the pain. I promise.</i>

481
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,611
I need some more medicine, nurse.

482
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:33,187
- Ready?
- Yeah.

483
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,222
One, two, three, go.

484
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:46,760
I hope you can fight.
I never put an orchid on a guy before.

485
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,597
<i>It's for my mother, Walt.</i>

486
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,708
<i>Okay, now you're breaking my heart.</i>

487
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:56,573
Sorry.

488
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:58,772
Quit smoking yesterday.

489
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,276
Great.

490
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:46,520
Jake.

491
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:53,332
What have you and your friends gotten into?

492
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:55,426
Nothing.

493
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:59,372
First Conrad, now Dakota
kills your professor and mutilates herself.

494
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,474
This is no coincidence.

495
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:06,779
You could be next.
I am not going to let that happen.

496
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:17,185
All right, can you take him home?
Make sure he gets some sleep?

497
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:22,197
Listen to me. First thing tomorrow morning,
you meet me at my cabin.

498
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:23,664
No one will disturb us there.

499
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:27,032
<i>But we're not leaving
until you tell me everything you know.</i>

500
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:10,613
Uncle Ross.

501
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:29,625
Nine points?

502
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,165
<i>Didn't hear you drive in.</i>

503
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,698
So, how are you holding up?

504
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,034
- Fine.
- Yeah?

505
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,610
<i>What's in the ground?</i>

506
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,911
<i>After a hunt, we bury the animal's remains.</i>

507
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:51,143
Native American ritual I taught Jake
when he was a kid.

508
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:53,916
<i>Returns the animal's soul to the Earth.</i>

509
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,251
Well, come on in.

510
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,494
When we started,
the Pathway was just a game...

511
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:09,538
that had this strange ability
of knowing what we were thinking.

512
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,836
But then Conrad used the gun
that I threw into the lake...

513
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,872
and then cuts his tongue off...

514
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:18,971
the way that I did
after a beast in a dream tells me to.

515
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:26,520
<i>So I'm thinking maybe it wasn't a dream.
Maybe it isn't just a game.</i>

516
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,528
<i>I feel like I'm going insane.</i>

517
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:45,397
<i>No, I think you're just looking for an answer
for something so horrible it has none.</i>

518
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:47,176
I like it here.

519
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:50,045
<i>It's peaceful.</i>

520
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:53,109
Thanks.

521
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:57,250
Well, I have to meet the FBI in my office
in a couple hours.

522
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,346
<i>I'll ask them to check
on this computer game of yours.</i>

523
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,985
<i>Why don't you spend the night here?</i>

524
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,385
It might do you some good.

525
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:28,109
Sheriff North.

526
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:40,720
What is it?

527
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:43,785
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

528
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:49,321
<i>I'm sorry, I think we ought to go.</i>

529
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,258
Okay.

530
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,241
Jake, talk to me.

531
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:10,184
Shit.

532
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:10,035
Give rest, O Christ, to your servant
with your Saints.

533
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:13,314
Where sorrow and pain are no more.

534
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:17,842
Neither sighing, but life everlasting.

535
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:23,183
You only are immortal,
the creator and maker of all.

536
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:27,094
We are mortal, formed of the earth...

537
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:30,391
and to the earth we shall return.

538
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:33,700
For so did you ordain
when you created us, saying:

539
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:37,837
<i>"You are dust, and to dust you shall return. "</i>

540
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,805
All of us go down to the dust...

541
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:44,611
yet even at the grave we make our song.

542
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:49,641
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.

543
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:03,393
<i>You know, you say there's a higher power
looking out for me?</i>

544
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:06,294
<i>Well, I need him now. He's not here.</i>

545
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:34,262
Jake, what is it?

546
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:42,871
I have to go see an old friend.

547
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:56,414
Jacob, why this sudden interest in Satan?

548
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:01,483
Do you think he really exists?

549
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:06,287
Many in the Church take the Devil
quite literally...

550
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:11,833
but I think of him as a symbol of temptation,
not as a beast with a pitchfork and horns.

551
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:26,639
What does it say in the Bible
about possession or self-mutilation?

552
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:31,277
You think that your two friends
were possessed?

553
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:34,549
Maybe.

554
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:44,532
Here in Mark 9:25:

555
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:50,972
<i>"When Jesus saw that a crowd was running
to the scene, he rebuked the evil spirit.</i>

556
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:55,510
<i>"'You deaf and mute spirit,' He said.
'I command you to come out of him. "'</i>

557
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:09,287
Again, sorry about your friend.

558
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:12,352
Thanks.

559
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,362
So when did you stop worshipping Satan?

560
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:29,539
<i>Ten years ago. I'm a Christian now.</i>

561
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:32,981
<i>It's more forgiving.</i>

562
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:36,675
<i>Why'd you even start?</i>

563
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:39,678
<i>Some folks want
what God ain't giving them:</i>

564
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:41,216
Money. Power.

565
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:43,584
Me? I wanted to get laid.

566
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:49,497
<i>There's more pussy at a Black Mass
than there is at a Metallica concert.</i>

567
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:53,532
What happens at a Black Mass?

568
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,360
People get naked.

569
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:58,272
Then they sacrifice something.

570
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:00,670
A cat or a dog.

571
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,903
Satan rewards you for killing a dog?

572
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:06,948
The more you give, the more you get.

573
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:10,109
What happens if you kill a human?

574
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:14,249
My group was more bankers
and housewives...

575
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,689
looking for a different kind of picnic.

576
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,285
Do you know any people
that are more devoted?

577
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:24,631
<i>You don't cross people
who are willing to give up their souls.</i>

578
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:34,706
Walt, please.

579
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:48,884
Yeah, I know a guy.

580
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:51,689
Just do me a favor.

581
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:56,158
<i>Don't tell him I sent you.</i>

582
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:14,209
Coming. Sammy.

583
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:20,082
<i>Mr. Reisz, I'm Jake Gray.</i>

584
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:23,357
I called about an hour ago,
said I was coming by.

585
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:28,864
Yeah.

586
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,990
I get $50 an hour for consultations.

587
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:33,460
Right.

588
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,428
I should charge more.

589
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,633
The guy who fixes my car gets $80.

590
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:44,812
Barely knows where the sparkplugs are,
much less how to conjure up Beelzebub.

591
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:56,681
I ever sell books to you before?

592
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:58,827
No.

593
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:12,699
<i>You say it's called the "Pathway"?</i>

594
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:14,134
Yes. Why?

595
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:18,407
<i>Because that's what we call the connection
between the Devil and the possessed.</i>

596
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:19,981
So how did I resist?

597
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:23,575
<i>We're often unaware of our strength
until we're tested.</i>

598
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:28,018
Why does the Devil need to use
computers or games?

599
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:29,352
Think about it.

600
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:32,326
<i>It's a very effective way
to spread a message.</i>

601
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:35,657
I mean, imagine if Hitler had
had the Internet.

602
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:38,899
<i>Maybe Satan's found someone
to do his bidding again.</i>

603
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:03,655
<i>I've seen this man...</i>

604
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:10,464
in my head.

605
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:11,824
So have I.

606
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:17,366
What makes you think
this guy can conjure Satan?

607
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,802
Because I taught him to.

608
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,040
When Aidan Kater came to me
to learn the black arts...

609
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:31,545
he was a geek
living out of the back of his van.

610
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,518
I stopped teaching a few years later...

611
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:38,659
but by then he was very skilled.

612
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:40,826
Why did you stop?

613
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:42,860
I was going to be a father.

614
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:45,792
Was?

615
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:49,768
Anne Kilton was a student of mine
before we were married.

616
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:52,072
The pregnancy was hard on her.

617
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:54,071
She had a bad premonition...

618
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:58,241
and asked me to perform a sacrifice
for the health of the baby.

619
01:06:58,481 --> 01:06:59,846
A human sacrifice.

620
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:02,708
I refused.

621
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:05,181
So Kater took your place.

622
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:09,416
I came home one night
and found a pentagram in my yard.

623
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:11,386
There was blood everywhere.

624
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:13,327
I thought at first:

625
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:16,864
<i>"Anne must have sacrificed
some kind of animal here. "</i>

626
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,395
But Anne was gone, too.

627
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:24,205
When they found her bloody clothes
in a ditch two days later, I knew...

628
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,969
Aidan Kater had sacrificed
my wife and unborn child.

629
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:31,540
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

630
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:34,109
What did the police say?

631
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:37,783
The police were very helpful.

632
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,287
They made me their prime suspect.

633
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:43,722
<i>I spent the next five years
trying to prove that I didn't do it.</i>

634
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:45,953
<i>And that's what I have left
to remember them by.</i>

635
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:50,124
An empty grave.

636
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,932
The Devil uses the Pathway
to possess people.

637
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:29,095
And then forces them to kill...

638
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:31,433
and commit suicide?

639
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:33,138
She seduces them.

640
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:38,379
<i>The Devil's a woman?</i>

641
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:40,911
<i>I don't know.
It can be whatever it needs to be.</i>

642
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:42,711
Or what you want it to be?

643
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:44,820
<i>I didn't want it to be a woman.</i>

644
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:47,319
You think Conrad and Dakota wanted
to die like that?

645
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:48,947
Some part of them did.

646
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:50,286
<i>You didn't even know them!</i>

647
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:53,520
<i>I'm not saying it's your fault.
I think that you're angry because...</i>

648
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:54,857
<i>Yes, I'm angry.</i>

649
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:57,466
<i>My friends are dead! I'm angry!</i>

650
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,791
<i>But I'm not crazy.
This Kater guy is behind this...</i>

651
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:03,133
<i>and I gotta do something.
I can't just stand here.</i>

652
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:06,640
What are you gonna do? Throw holy water
on him? Burn him at the stake?

653
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:08,607
You believed me
when I said I saw something.

654
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:11,737
I did. I believed that you had a vision,
maybe, or an apparition.

655
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:13,712
The bitch was in my basement!

656
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:15,678
Okay. You know what?

657
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:20,080
This is getting a little bit too heavy
for me right now.

658
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:25,255
I adore you,
but this is getting to be too much.

659
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:27,192
<i>I guess I shouldn't have come here.</i>

660
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:28,524
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

661
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:30,898
Fucking shit.

662
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:15,903
<i>We're not going to be able to save you now.</i>

663
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:19,700
<i>You are dust, and to dust you shall return.</i>

664
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:21,207
<i>He's gone to hell.</i>

665
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:40,052
Where you going with those, Jake?

666
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:42,791
To your mother and father?

667
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,225
<i>You can't do that, man.</i>

668
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:48,828
<i>You'll ruin everything.</i>

669
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:00,306
Jake.

670
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,683
<i>I didn't have a choice.</i>

671
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,817
Neither of us do.

672
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:13,294
Are we in hell?

673
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:14,487
No.

674
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:17,998
<i>But hell ain't so bad.</i>

675
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:21,461
<i>You'll see.</i>

676
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:44,418
You know, you remind me of myself
when I was your age.

677
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:45,685
Smart.

678
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:47,887
Angry.

679
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:51,661
Trying desperately to pretend
that I was something good...

680
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:54,827
<i>but somehow deep down inside
knowing you're not.</i>

681
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:57,169
<i>I'm nothing like you. I don't kill people.</i>

682
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:59,069
No, you just dream about it.

683
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:04,372
Is this how you got to Conrad and Dakota?

684
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,142
You mess with their minds
until they do what you tell them?

685
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:08,443
It was a test.

686
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,050
They failed. You passed.

687
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,056
You stared the Devil directly in the face...

688
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,855
and you never looked away.

689
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:27,130
But when you finally did...

690
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:29,266
<i>we knew that we'd found you.</i>

691
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:31,963
You used the Pathway to find me?

692
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:37,637
Why?

693
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:40,105
Because you were stolen from us...

694
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,877
and we needed a way to get you back.

695
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:44,476
Stolen?

696
01:13:46,121 --> 01:13:47,088
By who?

697
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:49,316
Those people you call your parents.

698
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:54,093
They found your mother where
she was hiding on the night you were born.

699
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:56,456
She was too weak to fight them.

700
01:13:58,767 --> 01:13:59,961
<i>You're insane.</i>

701
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:04,435
You were taken from your real mother
on the night you were born.

702
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,236
My real mother?

703
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:09,035
Anne Kilton.

704
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:12,178
Bullshit.

705
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:16,240
Anne never had a child.
You made sure of that.

706
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:18,979
Every son wants to believe his father...

707
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,885
<i>but faking Anne's death
kept Ivan from the truth.</i>

708
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:23,955
You belong to us.

709
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:26,083
You always have.

710
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:28,123
Anne had a plan...

711
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:30,289
but when Paul and Kathy interfered...

712
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:32,890
you went from being a Prince of Darkness...

713
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:35,128
to just another fucked up kid.

714
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:42,437
Look.

715
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,180
Your whole life is a lie.

716
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,210
Why are you doing this to me?

717
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:54,414
Why?

718
01:15:36,565 --> 01:15:37,896
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

719
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,366
<i>She'll explain everything.</i>

720
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:45,839
Where is she?

721
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:08,440
I know who you are now.

722
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:06,598
Why?

723
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:33,723
No!

724
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:15,034
<i>There's a higher power looking out for you.</i>

725
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:21,335
I had to make sure
my son still belonged to me.

726
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:23,001
Oh, God.

727
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:26,343
You had to kill
before I could show myself to you.

728
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,575
They took you from me...

729
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:33,950
<i>but I'm sorry I had to do this to you.</i>

730
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:39,290
<i>That isn't your blood.</i>

731
01:21:42,931 --> 01:21:44,228
Drink this.

732
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,794
Accept who you were born to be...

733
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:51,935
or go back to the life that you hate.

734
01:22:02,117 --> 01:22:03,584
Will you be with me?

735
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:06,746
<i>I'll be whatever you need me to be.</i>

736
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:15,779
<i>You're a monster.</i>

737
01:24:20,922 --> 01:24:22,981
<i>My God, they think I killed them?</i>

738
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:27,590
<i>The Devil couldn't kill her child,
so this is how she makes me pay...</i>

739
01:24:27,695 --> 01:24:29,356
<i>for wanting to be human.</i>

740
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:32,793
<i>But maybe they're right.</i>

741
01:24:32,934 --> 01:24:34,663
<i>Maybe there is no Pathway.</i>

742
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:39,639
<i>And this is all a fantasy I've created
to live with the horrible things I'd done.</i>

743
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:44,045
<i>Wake me from this nightmare.</i>

744
01:24:44,646 --> 01:24:47,342
<i>Please. Help me.</i>

745
