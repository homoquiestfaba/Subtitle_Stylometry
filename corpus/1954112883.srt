This is a calamity!

An absolute calamity!

possibly be this time?

There's no submarine?

00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,660
What happened
to all of these stories?!!

184
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,601
Ah, what a disaster.
What are we going to do now?

185
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,639
Je ne sais pas.
Ooh la la.

Oh la la la la la.

187
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,839
I'll have to
advise the president

188
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,207
that he needs to cancel
the Jules Verne event,

189
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,008
and then you and I
must go to see the Professor.

Oh, no no no no no.
Oui oui.

Oh, no.
Oh, oui.

00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,019
Please, no.
Oui!

193
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,220
What? Absolutely not.

194
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:48,197
Don't you realize how important
the Jules Verne event is?

if you don't

196
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,326

Sweetie, about my big event
yes?

I need a bigger budget...
Well...

more money to make it
more spectacular,

about going down...

fix this mess, or else.

But, minister Chateau, please.

209
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,962
With all due respect.

Je ne sais pas
if it is a good idea

211
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,963
for us to go and ask
the Professor for his help!

212
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,025
Pascal, there's no one
who knows more

213
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,163
about science fiction
than he does.

214
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:32,073
Oui! But, the Professor
is also totally crazy!

215
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,701
Completement fou!

00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,212
Oh, please.

00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,906
Last time I saw him.

218
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,611
He got angry and tried
to transform me into a dog!

219
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,711
It was an absolute nightmare!

220
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,255
You made him angry?

221
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,621
He's already a mad scientist.
Don't make him madder!

222
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,125
Now you tell me.

223
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,388
Anyway, he doesn't
understand the difference

224
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,756
between science
and science-fiction.

225
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,889
He's completely nuts!

226
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,297
Yes, that's true.

227
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,096
I guess you could say
he's a little unbalanced.

who can figure this out.

Even to this day, I still bark
whenever I see a squirrel.

231
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:10,810
And forget about what I do
when I'm near a fire hydrant.

232
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,850
I know precisely what happened!

233
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,680
Someone has found
the Imaginasium

234
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,380
and used it
to sabotage these stories.

00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,218
I invented it years ago.

236
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,259
But the government
shut the project down.

It really works. Woo-hoo-hoo!

Hm, so what
is your suggestion, Professor?

242
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,442
Do you really think
it might be possible

243
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,008
to put the stories
back into their original state?

244
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:45,038
Well, I might have a solution,
but first I need Pascal's help

I've been working on.

Yeah, that is unusual.

to your problem, Chateau.

was way ahead of his time.

in each of his stories

Yes, about that

I have some good news
and bad news.

722
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:02,323
You see, the restart button
is very close by.

00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,121
That's the good news...

724
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,718
And, its also the bad news,
I'm afraid.

725
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,486
What do you mean?

726
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,532
What I'm saying
is that the restart button

727
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,725
is on the rocket

728
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,332

Why didn't you tell us that

when we were
back on earth, Pascal?

00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,373
was a safe
and completely tested machine.

it was completely tested.

in "adventure."

It's the beginning
of the word "restart!"

And, then along with "star"
and the "t" in "tours,"

791

it spells out "restart!"
