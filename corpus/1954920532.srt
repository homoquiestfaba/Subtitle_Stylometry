00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:39,868
I'm sure it'll be easy.

175
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:43,047
MR. WU: Okay, everyone,
let's get started.

176
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:46,750
I hope you've all
studied very hard.

177
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:52,918

Good luck.

McKenna,
can I see you for a moment?

187
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:15,800
MRS. BROOKS: I just
don't understand it. It's
so not like you to cheat!

188
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:18,875
I tried to do it on my own
but it was like...

189
00:13:19,245 --> 00:13:21,475
I couldn't remember
anything I was reading.

190
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:23,709
(SIGHS) I don't know,
okay?

191
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:26,083
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:27,210
It's time to
meet that tutor.

193
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:30,380
Mr. Wu had to give you
a zero on the quiz.

194
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:31,612
He did?

195
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:32,680
MR. BROOKS: Yeah.

196
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:35,554
He thinks you might
have a problem with
reading comprehension.

197
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:36,954
He does?

198
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:38,087
Yeah. It happens a lot.

199
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:39,524
When I was
an elementary-school teacher,

200
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:40,827
I used to
see it all the time.

201
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,834
Mr. Wu says a lot
of fourth graders
deal with this.

202
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,962
There's even a name for it,
"fourth grade slump."

203
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:48,668
What's that?

204
00:13:48,741 --> 00:13:49,935
Well, you know how to read.

205
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:52,509
Now it's all
about understanding
what you're reading.

206
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:54,509
That's where
you're getting stuck.

207
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,781
But I can't get
a tutor right now.

208
00:13:57,283 --> 00:13:58,682
I have so much going on.

209
00:13:58,784 --> 00:13:59,944
You mean gymnastics?

210
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:01,643
Well, yes, gymnastics.

211
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:03,183
Making the regional team

212
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:06,248
is the most important thing
to me in the whole world!

213
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:08,850
McKenna, listen up,
because here's the deal.

214
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:12,723
No tutor, no gymnastics.

215
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:15,157
Your school work
has to come first.

216
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:18,164
You're gonna start
with the tutor tomorrow.

217
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:23,898
Okay.

218
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:26,402
Thanks.

219
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,444

your punishment
for cheating later.

00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:50,424
McKenna?

223
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,329
Hey. I'm Josie.

224
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,044
So you're my tutor?

225
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:05,549
Yep! Have a seat.

226
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:08,085
As you can see,
I've already done that.

227
00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:10,514
I call him Lightning.

228
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:15,226
Cool. I like the color.

229
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:16,522
Thanks.

230
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,560
So, I guess
you've been having
some reading problems?

231
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:23,359
So my teacher says.
But I really
don't see how I could.

232
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:25,301
I mean,
I used to love to read...

233
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:28,204
Used to? But not anymore.

234
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:32,469
I don't know, it's boring.
And I'm really busy
with gymnastics.

235
00:15:32,979 --> 00:15:34,640
Oh, yeah, that's right,
you're a gymnast.

236
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:37,945
Well, maybe you
can think of
studying with me

237
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:39,575
as gymnastics
for your brain.

238
00:15:46,892 --> 00:15:48,826
Hi, did the book
I reserved come in?

240
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:54,733

00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:08,179
Sorry, I dropped my pencil.

243
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:12,311
Actually,
I'm already gonna be
late for gymnastics.

244
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:14,046
So, can we start?

245
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,420
Yeah. I have
a flute lesson after this.

246
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:18,252
So let's make
the most of our time.

247
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:22,394
If that's okay
with your pencil.

248
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:26,396
Right.
Okay.

249
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:28,859
So, let's work on this today.

250
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:30,629
You said you had trouble
with a quiz, right?

251
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:32,136
I guess.

252
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:34,564
Okay, here you go.

253
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:41,908
Where were you?

254
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:43,980
What do you mean,
where was I?

255
00:16:44,216 --> 00:16:45,308
It's Wednesday!

256
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:48,080
We always get smoothies
before practice
on Wednesdays.

257
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:51,718
Oh, right. Sorry,
I guess I spaced out.

258
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:59,965
So, are you psyched
for the demonstration
this weekend?

259
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,097
I can't wait to show you up
with my killer beam.

260
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:06,161
I don't know,
my mom keeps saying

261
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:08,069
I need more work
on my floor routine.

262
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:10,571
She says
I've been goofing off.

263
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:12,036
You have not!

264
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:14,805
And besides,
it's just a demonstration.

265
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,711
They're not even
gonna be judging us!

266
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:23,084

00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:30,419
No, I'm just super thirsty.

I'm such a loser

kindergarten books?

You're not a loser, McKenna.

286
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:43,531
Sometimes we have to
go back to the basics,

287
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:45,866
and go back to
what feels easy.

288

Don't you ever do
that in gymnastics?

but this is not gymnastics!

00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:55,946
I don't think
this is gonna work.

292
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:58,414
I think I need to
get another tutor.

that's your choice.

get off balance.

be there for you guys

do it all on my own,

take you to practice,
be home to make dinner.

What?

00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:19,462

I couldn't do it
all on my own.

taught me something.

want to be here.

to try again Thursday.

the whole time hiding again.

525

What?

526
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:10,475
Look, I get it that
you're embarrassed
to have a tutor,

527
00:36:10,548 --> 00:36:13,073
but this is not gonna work
unless you give it a chance.

528

ready to do that
by Thursday.

I really love how hard
you're working today,

531
00:36:34,672 --> 00:36:36,003
but why don't you
take a break, now?

532
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:39,439
I can't.
My mom says my floor
routine looks messy.

533
00:36:39,711 --> 00:36:41,508
I think I need to
keep working on it.

534
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:44,740
I mean, my sister made it
to the Olympic trials
in that event!

535
00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:46,741
Yeah,
but then Tasha fell

536
00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:49,218
and she broke her wrist
and couldn't compete.

537
00:36:49,554 --> 00:36:52,045
You know there is
such a thing
as training too hard.

538
00:36:52,924 --> 00:36:55,586
Besides, gymnastics
is supposed to be fun!

539
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:02,094
Tell that to my mom.

540
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,432
Um...

541
00:37:11,242 --> 00:37:13,233
I just wanted to
tell you something.

542
00:37:15,113 --> 00:37:16,637
I had a tutor too.

543
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:20,511
You did?
But you have straight A's.

544
00:37:20,652 --> 00:37:23,246
Now I do, but I used to
be really bad at math.

545
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:25,149
So, I needed help.

546
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,722
But now, math is
a lot easier for me.

547
00:37:30,662 --> 00:37:32,357
Please don't tell anyone
I have a tutor.

548
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,560
I mean,
I know you had one and all,

549
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:37,464
but I'm not ready for anyone
to know about mine.

550
00:37:37,735 --> 00:37:39,566
I won't. I promise.

551
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:41,469

00:37:43,174 --> 00:37:44,163

to have a tutor.

You're just trying to help.

Geez, took you long enough
to figure that out.

things your way.

(INAUDIBLE)

1294
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:55,368
MCKENNA: <i>Some people</i>
<i>think that athletes</i>
<i>only define success</i>

1295
01:28:55,977 --> 01:28:57,638
by whether they win or lose.

1296
01:28:58,279 --> 01:29:00,110
But the most
successful athletes

1297
01:29:00,682 --> 01:29:04,550
<i>know that winning or</i>
<i>losing isn't the only</i>
<i>thing that matters.</i>

1298
01:29:05,086 --> 01:29:06,917
<i>They are able</i>
<i>to balance sports</i>

1299
01:29:07,389 --> 01:29:10,358
with all
the other important things
going on in their lives.

1300
01:29:11,159 --> 01:29:13,559
That's why balance
is an important theme
in this book.

1301
01:29:13,928 --> 01:29:16,522
Another lesson in
this book is that no one

1302
01:29:16,598 --> 01:29:19,158
achieves greatness
without help from others.

1303
01:29:19,868 --> 01:29:22,769
Everyone runs into trouble
and everyone gets scared.

1304
01:29:23,838 --> 01:29:25,669
But you can get
through any problem,

1305
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:27,765
and turn even
the worst days

1306
01:29:27,842 --> 01:29:29,833
into the ones that make
your dreams come true.

<i>have the support</i>
