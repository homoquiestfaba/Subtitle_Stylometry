1
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:45,479
Patrick, it's me.
Are you blind?

2
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,915
Maggie?

3
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:49,147
Something really horrible
has happened to one of the boys.

4
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:50,154
Which one?

5
00:03:50,222 --> 00:03:51,155
Well, I don't know which one.

6
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:52,452
I'm not really sure.

7
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,992
All the colors, they got dark.

8
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:55,185
Colors?

9
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,354
I had a premonition dream, OK?

10
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:58,487
Wait a second.

11
00:03:58,563 --> 00:04:00,964
You're waking me up
at five in the morning...

12
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,397
to tell me about
a premonition dream?

13
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:03,935
Yes, I am.

14
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:05,936
Look, all right, I'm sorry.

15
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:07,631
The last time,
I made a big mistake.

16
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,639
I had the wrong kid, OK?

17
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,038
I was absolutely sure
it was Darren.

18
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:11,940
And it turned out
to be Gideon.

19
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,273
Don't you remember?
Gideon broke his ankle.

20
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:14,779
This is exactly
what happens, Mag...

21
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:17,281
when you sleep alone, you know?
You hallucinate.

22
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:19,113
It has nothing to do
with me sleeping alone.

23
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:20,379
I like sleeping alone.

24
00:04:20,452 --> 00:04:22,284
Well, then maybe
some little bitty part of you...

25
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:23,549
doesn't like sleeping alone.

26
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:24,612
Get serious, please.

27
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:27,454
Why don't you call all the boys
and conduct an inquiry?

28
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,128
It would make you
feel better.

29
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:33,221
Look, just let me know
if you have any sexy dreams...

30
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:34,959
involving
your estranged husband.

31
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:36,057
Patrick, stop it.

32
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:37,067
Tits and elbows.

33
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:39,297
Just stop it.
Will you stop it?!

34
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:41,169
Have your eyes
really gotten better?

35
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,298
They're perfect.
Isn't that amazing?

36
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,308
It's a sign.

37
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:45,343
-It's not a sign.
-It's a sign.

38
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,139
It's not a sign, Mag.

39
00:04:52,517 --> 00:04:54,679
Oh, it's Alfred.

40
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,016
Alfred.

41
00:04:59,057 --> 00:05:02,152
I got up early
this morning to work.

42
00:05:02,227 --> 00:05:03,922
Oh, God, Cynthia.

43
00:05:03,995 --> 00:05:06,464
I can't get enough of you.

44
00:05:26,017 --> 00:05:27,485
Why are you doing this?

45
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:29,452
Couldn't sleep.

46
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:30,955
Bad dream?

47
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:32,456
Premonition dream.

48
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:35,152
Yeah? Which one of us
was bumped off this time?

49
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:38,958
I don't know.
It got dark towards the end.

50
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,328
That's great. Now you
can worry about all of us.

51
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,165
Not you. You're right here
with me, safe and--

52
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:47,967
Simon, are these dreadlocks?

53
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:50,667
Sure are.

54
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:52,506
Well, I didn't know
you had the kind of hair...

55
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:53,976
that could do that.

56
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:55,479
A little Jell-o does it.

57
00:05:55,547 --> 00:05:57,982
Jell-o? I ate Jell-o.

58
00:05:58,049 --> 00:06:00,017
It never did that to my hair.

59
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:02,452
Mom, you put the Jell-o
in your hair.

60
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,454
You let it dry.
You don't wash it out.

61
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:06,047
Oh, OK.

62
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,122
How many times have I told you
to clean out this garage?

63
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:13,790
Twenty or thirty.

64
00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:15,799
Well, it's happening today.

65
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,129
It's Izzy.

66
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:21,468
It's not Alfred.

67
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:22,665
It's Izzy.

68
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,516
Well, don't look, then.
It's not you.

69
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,307
All right.

70
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,709
You win.

71
00:07:07,452 --> 00:07:12,891
Well, Mom, first one back
to the car gets to drive.

72
00:07:12,957 --> 00:07:14,083
Oh, since when do
fourteen-year-olds...

73
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:15,251
know how to drive?

74
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:18,023
Since that fourteen-year-old's
older brother taught them how.

75
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:19,188
Who taught you? When?

76
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:20,493
Come on, get a move on, Mom.

77
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,033
You take Silvermans'.

78
00:07:29,474 --> 00:07:30,908
Simon.

79
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:32,409
Nope. His mom.

80
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:35,572
Oh! They've sure got you out
on some freezing morning.

81
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:37,906
Say, how are those cute twins?

82
00:07:37,982 --> 00:07:39,040
They're great.
They're at school.

83
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,152
Leave me alone!

84
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:47,491
Stop!

85
00:07:48,827 --> 00:07:50,022
Get out of here!

86
00:08:00,004 --> 00:08:01,699
Mom?

87
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:07,269
Watch out!

88
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:09,609
Daisy! Daisy, come here.
Come here.

89
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:10,614
Daisy?

90
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:12,047
Come on, baby.

91
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,915
You keep that monster inside.

92
00:08:13,985 --> 00:08:15,475
There's a leash law, you know.

93
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:17,214
She already bit my son once.

94
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,188
I want my paper.

95
00:08:19,257 --> 00:08:20,986
You better not leave it there.

96
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:24,290
The next time, it's going
to be in the street, OK?

97
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:25,693
You're supposed to bring
it to the front porch.

98
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:27,254
Bastard.

99
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:28,925
Language, Mom.

100
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,595
Jesus Christ, he could have
taken a chunk out of you.

101
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,694
He was aimed for the Kill.

102
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:35,604
I know, those teeth,
they just--

103
00:08:35,673 --> 00:08:36,606
It's the twins.

104
00:08:36,674 --> 00:08:37,607
What?

105
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:38,608
Mrs. Silverman
mentioned the twins.

106
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:39,939
It's the twins.

107
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:41,979
Oh, Mom, how do you know
it wasn't me--

108
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:43,275
I mean, with the dog?

109
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:44,873
No, because now it's over.

110
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:45,939
I'd feel better if it was you.

111
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:47,109
But I don't feel better.
I feel much worse.

112
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:48,448
It's the twins.

113
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,784
We know it's not the twins.
We talked to them last night.

114
00:08:50,855 --> 00:08:53,790
What bad things could happen
in a dorm room overnight?

115
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:55,292
Earthquake, fire,
drugs, accident.

116
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,955
Oh, now there we go.
All real possible, Mom.

117
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,727
Now, look, we know
it's not Gideon...

118
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,064
because nothing bad
ever happens in Utah.

119
00:09:04,135 --> 00:09:05,261
Who taught you that?

120
00:09:06,771 --> 00:09:08,239
I can be as crazy as you.

121
00:09:08,306 --> 00:09:10,206
I'm a mother.
I've earned it.

122
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:11,902
Forgot about Percival.

123
00:09:11,976 --> 00:09:12,943
Percival.

124
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:19,883
Hey, all you singers
back home.

125
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:22,215
This is me and my buddies...

126
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:24,551
bringing you greetings
from the Sinai.

127
00:09:24,622 --> 00:09:27,250
Hey, Mom, I miss you.

128
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:29,089
Hey, Dad.

129
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,254
Things are going
pretty well here.

130
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:32,922
They treat me pretty good.

131
00:09:32,997 --> 00:09:35,261
But there's not
a whole lot to do.

132
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,267
We do get movies
every Sunday--

133
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:39,929
a lot of Sylvester Stallones
and "Lethal Weapons."

134
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:41,768
I think they're trying
to tell us something--

135
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,706
trying to make us
into heroes or something.

136
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:49,913
Dad.

137
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:53,747
Hey. What the hell
have you done to your head?

138
00:09:53,818 --> 00:09:55,547
What are you doing here?

139
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,487
Hey, look at this number
in the background here--

140
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,489
in the black.

141
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,490
Great thighs.

142
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,617
Patrick.

143
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:03,786
Pink's better. Better buns.

144
00:10:03,862 --> 00:10:04,920
Patrick.

145
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:09,432
What's going on with
the boxes in the hallway?

146
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,592
What are you doing here?

147
00:10:10,668 --> 00:10:11,931
Mom, have a heart.

148
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:14,768
Well, I wasn't real happy
with our phone conversation.

149
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:16,933
And I'm not sleeping
very well at the office.

150
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:18,100
Well, then, why don't
you get an apartment?

151
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:19,109
Will you chill?

152
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:22,442
Any halfway reasonable man
who's separated from his wife...

153
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:23,605
rents an apartment.

154
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:26,048
You're not allowed to
just bop in here now.

155
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:27,107
I'm not allowed?

156
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:29,620
Who paid for this place?
Is this my jacket?

157
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:30,620
Will you stop it?

158
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:31,655
-It is my jacket!
-No, it isn't!

159
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,248
Give me that!

160
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:35,588
And will you please turn
down that trashy noise?

161
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,627
I think you're right
about her.

162
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:55,981
You know, if you were
to suddenly turn soft...

163
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:57,981
I wouldn't hold it against you.

164
00:10:58,049 --> 00:10:59,710
Patrick, don't. Look...

165
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,947
Simon and I are moving.

166
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,915
Oh, that's smart...

167
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,789
when you got a completely
paid-for house right here.

168
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,954
I want to be closer
to my work.

169
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:12,360
Work? What work?

170
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,920
We interrupt this
regularly scheduled program...

171
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:14,965
for a news bulletin.

172
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:16,694
I told you to turn that--

173
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:17,929
Forty-three marines
are reported dead...

174
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:19,697
an unknown number injured...

175
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:22,138
in an explosion this morning
at the American compound...

176
00:11:22,206 --> 00:11:23,867
of the multinational
peacekeeping force...

177
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,205
in the Sinai desert.

178
00:11:25,276 --> 00:11:26,471
Oh, my God. It's Percival.

179
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:27,807
Details remain sketchy
at this hour.

180
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,643
But preliminary reports
indicate the blast occurred...

181
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:30,840
in the early morning hours.

182
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:34,943
It was of suspicious origin,
the explosion leveling...

183
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,612
the three-story
headquarters building...

184
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:39,157
where an undisclosed number
of marines were sleeping.

185
00:11:39,223 --> 00:11:40,418
Is that where he is?

186
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,653
What building did
they say it was, Simon?

187
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:43,888
...with updated information
as it becomes available.

188
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:46,294
Turn it off.

189
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:47,763
Didn't they say
it was a noncombat zone?

190
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,766
There was forty-three
killed out of five hundred?

191
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,268
Wait.

192
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,804
The blast apparently collapsed
the Marine building...

193
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,168
which was located on
the southern tip of the Sinai...

194
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:57,003
near the town
of Sharm El-Sheikh.

195
00:11:57,075 --> 00:11:58,304
More than sixty men
are known dead.

196
00:11:58,376 --> 00:11:59,502
Sixty?
They just said forty-three.

197
00:11:59,577 --> 00:12:00,567
Efforts are underway
to rescue others...

198
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:01,874
still trapped
beneath the debris.

199
00:12:01,946 --> 00:12:04,677
Reporting live from the Sinai...

200
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:06,717
we now take you back
to our studios.

201
00:12:06,784 --> 00:12:08,616
We will bring you
the latest update...

202
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,620
as soon as more details
become available.

203
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,782
Now back to
your local programming.

204
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:24,996
How many men were actually
sleeping in that building?

205
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,472
Why don't you know?

206
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,975
Doesn't the Marine Corps
keep tabs on its few good men?

207
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,875
OK, look, when do you think...

208
00:12:33,945 --> 00:12:35,970
you might
know something definite?

209
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,311
If you don't know...

210
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:42,320
who can I call
who might know something?

211
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,822
You can't be telling me
there's nothing I can do!

212
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,220
I got a son over there!

213
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:56,066
It's quite a situation,
isn't it...

214
00:12:56,134 --> 00:12:59,104
when there's nothing
you can do but wait?

215
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:34,972
Come on, guys.

216
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,973
Crank it up.

217
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,976
We're going to be late
for church.

218
00:13:40,044 --> 00:13:40,977
Hurry upstairs.

219
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:43,070
Get your shoes on. Come on.

220
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:45,206
We're running behind.

221
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:52,112
OK. Reasons you won't
marry me again?

222
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,989
Because you're too young.

223
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:56,151
That's inconsequential.

224
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:57,888
I have a note from my mom.
You've seen it.

225
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:11,532
What?

226
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:24,852
I called Alfred.

227
00:14:30,027 --> 00:14:31,995
Mom needs him.

228
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:56,384
What did they say?

229
00:14:56,454 --> 00:14:59,583
Nothing. They had
absolutely nothing to say.

230
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:01,250
"You'll just have to wait,
sir...

231
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:02,850
"like all the rest of us.”

232
00:15:04,162 --> 00:15:08,030
I had too many children.
I was asking for trouble.

233
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:09,589
Oh, knock it off with
the self-pity, will ya?

234
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:12,432
An explosion happened.
That's all we know.

235
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:14,130
You're spoiling that cat.

236
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,433
She happens to miss me.

237
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:19,237
See?

238
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,456
For twenty-five years now...

239
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:43,126
you have been dunking your tea
bag exactly seven times...

240
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:45,966
and then throwing it
in the sink.

241
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:52,641
Who do you think takes
your tea bag from the sink...

242
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,509
and puts it into the garbage?

243
00:15:57,548 --> 00:15:59,516
Where is the garbage?

244
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:03,821
...estimated that more than...

245
00:16:03,821 --> 00:16:04,652
...estimated that more than...

246
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:06,918
seventy-five marines
have been killed.

247
00:16:06,991 --> 00:16:09,619
And it's feared
the body count is rising.

248
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:15,431
Give as much as you can,
brothers and sisters.

249
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:17,490
Give as much
as you possibly can...

250
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:20,765
to spread the word of God...

251
00:16:20,838 --> 00:16:22,932
and tell us your want.

252
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:24,941
We'll make your pledge
work hard.

253
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:28,445
We'll do our best
to pray over your want.

254
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:32,107
Every dollar is appreciated,
every fifty-cent piece...

255
00:16:32,183 --> 00:16:34,447
every nickel you send in.

256
00:16:34,518 --> 00:16:37,453
God isn't greedy.

257
00:16:37,521 --> 00:16:40,957
He knows that life is hard,
full of...

258
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:42,459
Why are we watching this?

259
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:44,460
Well, it beats the news.

260
00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:45,791
I called Beth O'Neal.

261
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:47,627
She doesn't have
any information.

262
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:49,462
If it weren't
for Tim O'Neal...

263
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,297
Percival wouldn't even
be in the Marines.

264
00:16:51,369 --> 00:16:52,803
He'd be sitting here
with us...

265
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,066
trying to find out if
anything's wrong with Tim.

266
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,800
Instead, here we are sitting
trying to find out...

267
00:16:56,874 --> 00:16:58,706
if something's
happened to Percival.

268
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:01,370
Mother, statistically,
it's very unlikely...

269
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:02,674
that Percival
has even been hurt.

270
00:17:02,747 --> 00:17:04,738
Alfred, what's
the good of statistics...

271
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,010
if you're
on the wrong end of it?

272
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:08,847
Well, I called Izzy.

273
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:10,683
He's picking up the twins
and bringing them home.

274
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:12,154
Not Gideon.
Don't call him yet.

275
00:17:12,223 --> 00:17:13,713
It'd be too hard for him.

276
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:14,849
Oh, shit.

277
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:16,359
What is it, Patrick?

278
00:17:16,427 --> 00:17:18,725
Uh-oh. Dad's blind again.

279
00:17:18,796 --> 00:17:20,423
Patrick, sit down.

280
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,262
For God's sake,
will you sit down?

281
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,233
You don't think I don't
know my way around here?

282
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,267
Did you bring your pills?
Where are they?

283
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,362
Who put all this junk
in here?

284
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,406
Are they in your jacket?

285
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:30,963
What is she doing?
What's with the boxes?

286
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:33,534
Mom says we're moving,
just me and her.

287
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:34,578
You left them here?

288
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:35,908
You were supposed
to have been moved out.

289
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,072
This is my house!

290
00:17:37,148 --> 00:17:38,445
What about Dad?

291
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,109
He's sleeping in his office.

292
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,243
It's weird,
even for this house.

293
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,788
We're separated!

294
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,253
Will you get
your father's pills?

295
00:17:45,323 --> 00:17:47,951
That's a good point.

296
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,493
Just sit down. Lay down.

297
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,858
Why do you have to be
so stubborn? Sit down.

298
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:53,454
You should take a shower...

299
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,589
and do something
about your hair.

300
00:17:54,665 --> 00:17:56,963
My hair? What big
fucking tragedy, my hair!

301
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,968
Patrick,
will you just lie down...

302
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,595
and stop pretending
like you're in charge?

303
00:18:00,671 --> 00:18:01,695
Listen!

304
00:18:01,772 --> 00:18:04,207
Ironically,
casualties may be higher...

305
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:07,404
Because on Sunday morning,
many of the men were asleep.

306
00:18:07,478 --> 00:18:08,809
Sunday is the one day...

307
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,576
most of them did not
have to report for duty.

308
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:13,083
God's day.

309
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,948
Identification of the bodies
will be made more difficult...

310
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:17,454
because most of the men
weren't wearing their dog tags.

311
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:19,580
The Marines will have to rely
on dental records.

312
00:18:19,657 --> 00:18:20,988
Pills, Dad.

313
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,119
...and officer identification
in those cases where...

314
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:33,467
Do you want me
to talk to her?

315
00:18:33,537 --> 00:18:34,936
No. Let her stew.

316
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:37,599
This is a zoo!

317
00:18:41,846 --> 00:18:42,813
Mother?

318
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:59,621
Why don't you...
go upstairs...

319
00:18:59,697 --> 00:19:01,256
and shower?

320
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:03,596
Everyone will be
coming home soon.

321
00:19:19,517 --> 00:19:22,953
I remember. This is
the Mussorgsky, isn't it?

322
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,955
Where all the movements
are different pictures.

323
00:19:26,023 --> 00:19:28,458
You told me about this once.

324
00:19:28,526 --> 00:19:32,463
I remember you--
this is the great gate at Kiev.

325
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,465
I remember you got down
the encyclopedia.

326
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:36,967
God, how old--

327
00:19:37,034 --> 00:19:39,969
I must have been six or seven?

328
00:19:40,037 --> 00:19:42,836
You showed me the pictures...

329
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:44,466
the wrought-iron gates...

330
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:47,477
and that, I don't know,
that church...

331
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:50,845
that church
with the gold dome.

332
00:19:54,051 --> 00:19:55,985
1 did that?

333
00:19:57,388 --> 00:19:58,947
And the bells here.

334
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:00,115
I remember you saying...

335
00:20:00,191 --> 00:20:01,886
that this was the sound
of stars falling...

336
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:04,553
of star confetti.

337
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:10,500
And it was the springtime...

338
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:14,505
and this was the celebration
of the Resurrection.

339
00:20:14,572 --> 00:20:17,735
"You see?" You said...

340
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:20,038
"There is possibility
of perfect joy."

341
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,547
That's fabulous.

342
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,017
I couldn't have done that.

343
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:29,018
I mean, you were six.

344
00:20:29,086 --> 00:20:31,521
That meant that Izzy was four.

345
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:33,523
Percival would have been two...

346
00:20:33,591 --> 00:20:34,990
Gideon just starting to walk.

347
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:36,151
I was pregnant with the twins.

348
00:20:36,227 --> 00:20:37,991
How could I possibly
have had the time...

349
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:41,191
to take a book down
and show you this?

350
00:20:41,265 --> 00:20:44,394
I don't know, but you did.

351
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:46,334
That must have been
Beth O'Neal.

352
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:48,531
I wasn't
that kind of a mom.

353
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,336
Well, what do you say?
Let's go.

354
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,435
A shower,
a change of clothes.

355
00:20:55,513 --> 00:20:58,813
I don't have to be dressed
to hear bad news.

356
00:20:58,883 --> 00:20:59,975
I know, Mother.

357
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,743
It's just that everyone
will be coming home...

358
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,754
and the neighbors
will probably stop by.

359
00:21:04,822 --> 00:21:06,813
People love a tragedy.

360
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,825
Well, Mother, you don't
have to talk to them...

361
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:09,860
or deal with them.

362
00:21:09,927 --> 00:21:13,625
I'll handle them.

363
00:21:13,697 --> 00:21:16,132
Oh, sweetie, you don't
have to do that.

364
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,690
Yes, I do.

365
00:21:17,768 --> 00:21:19,167
I do, and I will.

366
00:21:22,206 --> 00:21:23,264
I know.

367
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:31,981
Oh, Alfred.

368
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:34,518
Take off your coat.

369
00:21:37,555 --> 00:21:39,523
Hi. Mom?

370
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:42,993
Hi, Mom.

371
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,494
Where's your laundry?

372
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:46,826
Mom, we wouldn't bring that
at a time like this.

373
00:21:46,897 --> 00:21:47,989
Have you heard anything yet?

374
00:21:48,065 --> 00:21:49,897
Hey, what's different?
You look terrible.

375
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:50,991
Yes, he does.

376
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:52,001
Who's there?
Who's come?

377
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:53,332
Your father's gone blind again.

378
00:21:53,404 --> 00:21:54,496
Oh! I thought that was over.

379
00:21:54,572 --> 00:21:56,506
No. He walks into this house,
he goes blind.

380
00:21:56,574 --> 00:21:57,666
What does that tell you?

381
00:21:57,741 --> 00:21:58,833
I don't know.
It could be stress.

382
00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:00,001
Hey, I am under stress.

383
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:01,101
Do you see me going blind?

384
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:03,612
Come on in here.
Don't listen to her.

385
00:22:03,681 --> 00:22:05,115
Hey. Go see Dad.

386
00:22:05,182 --> 00:22:06,115
Hey, how are you?

387
00:22:06,183 --> 00:22:07,116
Go see Dad.

388
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:09,448
It's pretty tense
around here, huh?

389
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,453
She's in crisis mode.

390
00:22:10,521 --> 00:22:11,454
Loud music?

391
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:12,455
Mussorgsky.

392
00:22:12,523 --> 00:22:14,457
Uh-oh. What are
all the boxes for?

393
00:22:14,525 --> 00:22:15,458
I don't know.

394
00:22:15,526 --> 00:22:16,823
Simon says they're moving
without Dad.

395
00:22:16,894 --> 00:22:18,794
Dad's been sleeping
at the office.

396
00:22:18,862 --> 00:22:20,296
She's never gone
this far before.

397
00:22:20,364 --> 00:22:22,458
Alfred, you have to talk to her.

398
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:23,625
Is she serious this time?

399
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:24,634
I don't know.

400
00:22:24,702 --> 00:22:25,794
We're all pretending
she's not, though.

401
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:27,462
Don't spoil the fun.

402
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:30,303
Typical.
Deny what you don't like.

403
00:22:30,374 --> 00:22:31,637
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

404
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:33,143
I just packed all this.

405
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,305
Looking for something--
something important.

406
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,973
So, come on, Dad.
Guess who?

407
00:22:38,048 --> 00:22:40,483
One of the twins?

408
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:41,484
Yeah, but which one?

409
00:22:41,552 --> 00:22:43,486
What, is this a test
or something?

410
00:22:43,554 --> 00:22:45,989
Yeah. Feel my face.

411
00:22:46,056 --> 00:22:47,990
What is this, a mustache?

412
00:22:48,058 --> 00:22:49,492
Yeah.

413
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,494
"M" For mustache,
"M" For Merle.

414
00:22:51,562 --> 00:22:53,496
Darren's clean-shaven.

415
00:22:53,564 --> 00:22:55,498
Oh, I see. So if I go
blind permanently...

416
00:22:55,566 --> 00:22:57,000
I can tell the two
of you apart?

417
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:59,001
Informa--who's this?

418
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:01,436
You still have
the headache, Dad?

419
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,769
What, everybody's
experimenting...

420
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,240
with their facial hair
or something?

421
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:07,243
So first the headache,
and then the eyes started?

422
00:23:07,311 --> 00:23:08,244
Yeah.

423
00:23:08,312 --> 00:23:09,245
Did you take your pills?

424
00:23:09,313 --> 00:23:10,371
Yes, I did.

425
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:11,380
...the Sinai desert.

426
00:23:11,448 --> 00:23:12,438
Wait! Shh! Shh!

427
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,608
...inquiries
from the families...

428
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,152
of the Sinai peacekeeping
contingent...

429
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:16,448
the Marines have announced...

430
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,113
that they will take
the unprecedented step...

431
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,020
of preparing
a list of survivors.

432
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,151
Spokesmen caution that rescue
efforts are still under way...

433
00:23:23,227 --> 00:23:24,888
and some units continue
to be scattered.

434
00:23:24,962 --> 00:23:28,796
So a definitive list may take
several days to prepare.

435
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,096
For further information,
relatives may call...

436
00:23:31,168 --> 00:23:32,135
Alfred.

437
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,102
Call that.

438
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:35,138
Damn it!

439
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,401
Oh, Simon, get your cat
out of this house.

440
00:23:37,474 --> 00:23:38,532
I'm busy.

441
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:40,475
We now return you to your
regularly scheduled...

442
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,069
All right. Darren?

443
00:23:42,146 --> 00:23:44,672
Come on. Merle?
The cat.

444
00:23:44,748 --> 00:23:46,477
Your father
could trip over it.

445
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,814
Get this cat--

446
00:23:50,154 --> 00:23:51,713
-Damn it!
-Mom, relax.

447
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:54,724
It's not the cat's fault.

448
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:55,987
Oh, no.

449
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,324
Hey, it's cold out there.

450
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,489
If she doesn't like it,
she can go in the garage.

451
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,998
It's really crowded in there.

452
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,261
Well, if you'd
cleaned it out...

453
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,767
it wouldn't be crowded,
now, would it?

454
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:11,000
Now what are you doing?

455
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,839
Something.

456
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,105
Simon, that's not an answer.

457
00:24:17,014 --> 00:24:19,312
It's just what we've heard.

458
00:24:20,651 --> 00:24:22,779
They're preparing a list.

459
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:24,617
Each survivor has to be seen...

460
00:24:24,688 --> 00:24:26,452
by a first sergeant
or an officer...

461
00:24:26,523 --> 00:24:28,150
before they put the name
on the list.

462
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:30,956
They said it could take days.

463
00:24:31,028 --> 00:24:32,996
What if a marine is wounded?

464
00:24:33,063 --> 00:24:35,828
I guess it takes longer.

465
00:24:40,871 --> 00:24:42,168
What if he's dead?

466
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:47,476
They send someone...

467
00:24:47,544 --> 00:24:50,479
a chaplain or an officer.

468
00:25:01,058 --> 00:25:04,119
We're in for a long siege.

469
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,301
That's Percival, Dad.

470
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:16,567
He's throwing passes
out on the front lawn.

471
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,008
He's got his green
football jersey on...

472
00:25:20,077 --> 00:25:21,875
his big old helmet.

473
00:25:21,945 --> 00:25:23,936
Yeah. He just
turned nine, right?

474
00:25:24,014 --> 00:25:26,813
Said he'd die if he couldn't
make the football team.

475
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,455
Break!

476
00:26:14,464 --> 00:26:15,454
Come on!

477
00:26:19,136 --> 00:26:20,604
That's all right.

478
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,064
Come on, line it up!

479
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:25,802
Shift!

480
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,708
Come on, Percy!

481
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:30,975
Grid eighteen!
Grid eighteen! Cigar!

482
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:33,316
Look out!

483
00:26:44,027 --> 00:26:45,256
Percy.

484
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:46,558
Sweetie.

485
00:26:54,037 --> 00:26:54,799
Mrs. Singer, wait a minute.

486
00:26:54,872 --> 00:26:56,169
We'll get a stretcher.

487
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:05,276
Wake up.
Wake up, Percy. Come on.

488
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,751
Wake up. You can do it.
Wake up, sweetie.

489
00:27:17,828 --> 00:27:19,489
Come on. Wake up.

490
00:27:26,503 --> 00:27:28,198
What's your name, son?

491
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,205
Percival Singer.

492
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,306
And who is this person
right here?

493
00:27:38,015 --> 00:27:40,279
My...my mother.

494
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,154
Pretty strong lady, too.

495
00:27:45,222 --> 00:27:47,953
She carried you
off that field herself.

496
00:27:48,025 --> 00:27:49,015
She what?

497
00:27:49,092 --> 00:27:51,356
In front of all the guys?

498
00:27:51,428 --> 00:27:53,055
Sure did.

499
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,532
She carried me?!
Like a baby?

500
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,533
And the guys saw?

501
00:27:57,601 --> 00:28:00,298
He's going to be fine.

502
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:04,238
Now, you keep him flat
for the rest of the day.

503
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,400
But if he sleeps too long...

504
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,909
wake him up
and give me a call.

505
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,411
Thank you so much.

506
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,604
You're welcome.

507
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,848
How could you?

508
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:15,681
Why didn't you
just leave me there?

509
00:28:15,752 --> 00:28:18,414
They have stretchers
for things like that.

510
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,149
Didn't you happen
to see the stretcher?

511
00:28:20,223 --> 00:28:23,591
I'm sorry. I just--
I couldn't help it.

512
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,651
That's no answer.

513
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,933
Look, sweetheart.

514
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,766
When a woman
becomes a mother...

515
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,430
there's just this little
part of her that takes hold.

516
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:39,339
And it grows and grows--
this monster-mother part--

517
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:40,774
kind of like
those little things...

518
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,437
that are in your cereal box,
when you add water...

519
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,946
they grow to three hundred-times
their original size.

520
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,005
Well, when a woman
becomes a mother...

521
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:49,747
it just rules her life,
this monster-mother...

522
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,379
three hundred-times-bigger
part.

523
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,889
Make some sense.

524
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:55,948
I saw you lying there.

525
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,927
I was scared.
I wanted to get you to help.

526
00:28:58,996 --> 00:29:01,363
And I couldn't
hear or see anything else.

527
00:29:01,431 --> 00:29:04,196
But other moms don't do
that weird stuff.

528
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:09,269
Well, you know, I'm sorry.

529
00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:11,740
But you just have to play
the hand you're dealt.

530
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,867
You're a difficult kid.
I'm a difficult mom.

531
00:29:13,944 --> 00:29:17,903
No! You're worse than that!
You do wrong things!

532
00:29:17,981 --> 00:29:20,075
All right.
Well, this time...

533
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,175
I'm going to do
a right thing.

534
00:29:22,252 --> 00:29:24,220
No more football.

535
00:29:24,287 --> 00:29:26,779
You mean for today, right?

536
00:29:26,857 --> 00:29:29,087
No, I mean forever.
It is too dangerous.

537
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:30,251
I can't protect you.

538
00:29:30,327 --> 00:29:31,954
Oh, you don't mean it.
Tell me you don't.

539
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:33,588
I do mean it.
Don't you realize...

540
00:29:33,663 --> 00:29:35,597
You could've been paralyzed?
You could've had a concussion?

541
00:29:35,665 --> 00:29:37,064
You could've broken your neck?

542
00:29:38,168 --> 00:29:40,637
You ruin my life!

543
00:29:40,704 --> 00:29:40,804
What is this, a goddamn morgue?

544
00:29:40,804 --> 00:29:42,602
What is this, a goddamn morgue?

545
00:29:42,672 --> 00:29:43,605
Mort.

546
00:29:43,673 --> 00:29:45,607
I mean, what the hell
is all this?

547
00:29:45,675 --> 00:29:47,939
Don't start, Mort.

548
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:50,946
The boxes. Explain the boxes.

549
00:29:52,349 --> 00:29:54,443
Simon and I are
moving to the city.

550
00:29:54,518 --> 00:29:56,247
Alone.

551
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:58,981
And Patrick, what about him?

552
00:29:59,056 --> 00:30:00,956
Patrick's going
conveniently blind.

553
00:30:01,024 --> 00:30:03,254
But not deliberately, Mag.

554
00:30:03,326 --> 00:30:05,761
I mean,
give the guy a break, huh?

555
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:09,424
He made a joke
about my getting a real job.

556
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:11,331
What does he call
your working for me?

557
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:12,766
It's only part-time...

558
00:30:12,836 --> 00:30:13,962
and it's the same thing
I used to do...

559
00:30:14,037 --> 00:30:15,300
when I was a volunteer,
only how you pay me...

560
00:30:15,372 --> 00:30:16,464
because you like
having me around.

561
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,304
Not true.
You're a pain in the ass.

562
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:22,334
Do you think I'm going to pass
that civil-service exam?

563
00:30:22,412 --> 00:30:23,811
Piece of cake.

564
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,905
Do you think I'd make
a good social worker?

565
00:30:25,982 --> 00:30:28,110
Sweetheart, it pours out of you.

566
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,481
Well, Patrick laughed at me.

567
00:30:32,556 --> 00:30:33,523
And?

568
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,024
-Hello?
-It wasn't funny.

569
00:30:35,092 --> 00:30:38,027
Yes, Percival Singer
is over there.

570
00:30:38,095 --> 00:30:40,325
No, we haven't
heard anything yet.

571
00:30:40,397 --> 00:30:42,058
What do I say?

572
00:30:44,568 --> 00:30:48,505
So is it like a throbbing pain,
or is it like a vise pain...

573
00:30:48,572 --> 00:30:50,666
or is it like
a hammering pain?

574
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,004
Knock it off, Izzy.
Pain is pain.

575
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:56,011
It's my turn to have a life.

576
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:59,049
I always thought
you had a good one.

577
00:31:00,584 --> 00:31:01,983
You should stop smoking.

578
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,726
That is a chicken coop.

579
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:18,461
Your father made us live
in a chicken coop.

580
00:31:18,535 --> 00:31:20,936
It was a--
it was a henhouse.

581
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,972
No, it was a chicken coop,
and it reeked of chickens.

582
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,973
And there were
little chicken ghosts.

583
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:27,066
And at night,
I could hear them cackling.

584
00:31:27,144 --> 00:31:29,476
Yeah, well, it was
structurally very sound.

585
00:31:30,947 --> 00:31:33,211
Mom, look at your
two little braids.

586
00:31:33,283 --> 00:31:34,808
You look so young.

587
00:31:34,885 --> 00:31:36,250
I was--l was twenty-three...

588
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:40,552
and I had two kids
and one on the way.

589
00:31:40,624 --> 00:31:42,490
Simon, turn it off.

590
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,993
The newspapers are calling.

591
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,755
Even the "New York Times."

592
00:31:45,829 --> 00:31:47,593
Well, we should try
to get ahold of Gideon.

593
00:31:47,664 --> 00:31:48,654
Not yet.

594
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:50,496
You want him to read
about it in the papers?

595
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:51,500
I'll get the number.

596
00:31:51,568 --> 00:31:52,501
I'll dial.

597
00:31:52,569 --> 00:31:54,162
I'll call. Come on, Dad.

598
00:31:54,237 --> 00:31:58,071
Look, if he hears my voice,
he's gonna know it's bad news.

599
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,475
Gideon, it's me.

600
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:33,634
Dad.

601
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,144
How are you doing?

602
00:32:35,212 --> 00:32:36,475
Good. How's it going?

603
00:32:38,381 --> 00:32:42,477
There's been an explosion
in the--in the Sinai...

604
00:32:42,552 --> 00:32:44,486
where Percival was stationed...

605
00:32:44,554 --> 00:32:47,615
and we can't get any word
yet on how he is.

606
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:49,921
Do you want me to come home?

607
00:32:49,993 --> 00:32:52,690
No. You've got
an important meet coming up.

608
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,163
This puts
the conference championship...

609
00:32:55,232 --> 00:32:56,996
in a hell of a perspective, Dad.

610
00:32:57,067 --> 00:32:59,832
Look, until we know
something more...

611
00:32:59,903 --> 00:33:02,531
the best thing you can do
is just to stay where you are.

612
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,574
Besides, Percival's probably OK.

613
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:06,439
We all have a pretty
good feeling about it.

614
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:09,103
You'll call me
if anything happens?

615
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:10,271
Yeah, we'll let you know...

616
00:33:10,347 --> 00:33:12,281
just as soon we find out
something, OK?

617
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:13,783
-OK.
-All right, buddy.

618
00:33:23,026 --> 00:33:24,289
Why did you tell him that?

619
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:25,624
What good's it going to do...

620
00:33:25,695 --> 00:33:27,356
for him to come
out here from Utah?

621
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,125
Maybe he wants to.

622
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:31,327
He'd miss days of training
to sit around here and mope.

623
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:33,096
Maybe he wants to be
with his family.

624
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:34,295
He's in training!

625
00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:35,736
He doesn't care about that now!

626
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:36,966
He's got to care about it.

627
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,030
He's got to concentrate
on what's real.

628
00:33:38,108 --> 00:33:39,132
If you lose that,
you lose--

629
00:33:39,209 --> 00:33:40,335
Lose what? What?

630
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:43,710
What, damn it?
What do you lose? What?

631
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:51,611
Can you see, Patrick?

632
00:33:51,688 --> 00:33:54,157
What? What can you see?
What does it look like, Dad?

633
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,988
It looks like you
need a shower, Mag.

634
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:05,195
I like you better blind.
Move.

635
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:18,948
Do you still have the headache?

636
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,279
Yeah, still there.

637
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:22,944
Possibly low blood sugar.

638
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,284
Hell, it's not
low blood sugar, Izzy.

639
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,120
They rejected
the chemical theory...

640
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:32,594
along with the virus theory
and the brain tumor theory.

641
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,965
Well, there's got to
be a cause, Dad.

642
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,298
Well, all the doctors
at Johns Hopkins...

643
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,633
couldn't come up with one.

644
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,639
So where does that leave me?

645
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,971
Uninformed
and periodically blind.

646
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,977
That doesn't mean you
have to give up looking.

647
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,480
What exactly would you
like me to do, lzzy?

648
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:52,811
I don't know.

649
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,180
I mean, I should know,
but I don't.

650
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:58,578
Lunch.

651
00:35:05,995 --> 00:35:07,929
Pass the bottle opener.

652
00:35:07,997 --> 00:35:10,932
Mrs. Anderson
baked us a cake, huh?

653
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,436
She's Simon's high-school
teacher or whatever.

654
00:35:14,504 --> 00:35:16,438
So how about my mustache?

655
00:35:16,506 --> 00:35:17,940
It looks pretty good.

656
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:20,442
It looks like long Velcro.

657
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,944
What is that?

658
00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:23,604
Go like this. You have
something on your lip.

659
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,613
It's because it's blond.

660
00:35:24,681 --> 00:35:26,945
I'm going to dye it.

661
00:35:27,016 --> 00:35:28,450
Should I dye it?

662
00:35:28,518 --> 00:35:30,953
It looks like tail hairs
on arat's a...

663
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,953
On a rat's ah?

664
00:35:32,021 --> 00:35:33,955
Ass. Like a rat's ass.

665
00:35:34,023 --> 00:35:35,457
Peanut butter.

666
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:37,118
You look like a rat's ass.

667
00:35:37,193 --> 00:35:39,662
I get it. I get it.

668
00:35:39,729 --> 00:35:41,163
Anyway, dye it green.

669
00:35:41,231 --> 00:35:44,963
Red. If you dye it red,
it will look like...

670
00:35:45,034 --> 00:35:46,468
Sweetie, don't do that.

671
00:35:46,536 --> 00:35:48,163
It's disgusting.

672
00:35:48,238 --> 00:35:49,467
I get the picture.

673
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:52,338
Let's talk
about something...

674
00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:55,344
Anyway, dye it green.
Dye it green.

675
00:35:55,412 --> 00:35:57,506
Oh, my God!

676
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,345
Simon, Jesus Christ.
Come here.

677
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,924
Hey, Ma, you better
have that disinfected.

678
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:13,360
Boil the finger or something.

679
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,558
Yeah, it's horribly unclean.

680
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:16,565
How does the song go--

681
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:17,759
the Irish one you used to sing?

682
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:20,599
Johnny McEldoo and McGee and me

683
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,434
And a couple or two or three

684
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:24,769
Went on a spree one day

685
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:28,277
We had a bob or two,
and we knew what to do

686
00:36:28,344 --> 00:36:32,781
And beer and whiskey flew

687
00:36:36,386 --> 00:36:37,649
Drop the other shoe.

688
00:36:58,475 --> 00:36:59,965
Do you know
what happens to a person...

689
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:02,011
when he's crushed to death?

690
00:37:04,981 --> 00:37:06,073
What, are
you going to give us...

691
00:37:06,149 --> 00:37:08,140
a complete description, or
what?

692
00:37:08,218 --> 00:37:11,153
Oh, I'm sorry, Patrick.
I didn't--

693
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:14,247
I'm sorry if I can't
push past the pain...

694
00:37:14,324 --> 00:37:16,315
the way you can this time.

695
00:37:16,392 --> 00:37:18,156
The pain?

696
00:37:18,228 --> 00:37:19,491
Push past the pain.

697
00:37:19,562 --> 00:37:20,620
Isn't that what you
always told the boys?

698
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,756
Just push past the pain,
and they always did.

699
00:37:22,832 --> 00:37:25,358
Past the shin splints
and the bone spurs...

700
00:37:25,435 --> 00:37:27,369
and the muscle spasms
and the...

701
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:31,598
It wouldn't hurt you to do
a little running yourself, Mag.

702
00:37:31,674 --> 00:37:33,233
Get your mind off things.

703
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:38,538
I don't want to get
my mind off things.

704
00:37:40,016 --> 00:37:41,279
You tortured your boys.

705
00:37:41,351 --> 00:37:42,477
All these years
yelling at them--

706
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:43,986
trying to
make them like you.

707
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,043
All right, Mom.
It's a little overboard.

708
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:51,494
All right, leave.
Go ahead.

709
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:54,462
Why don't you just split
if it's too much for you?

710
00:37:54,531 --> 00:37:56,465
Yeah, it is too much for me.

711
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:58,297
You torture yourself.

712
00:38:02,472 --> 00:38:03,940
Good, Mom.

713
00:38:12,382 --> 00:38:14,407
Dad, where you going?

714
00:38:14,484 --> 00:38:16,452
For a stroll.

715
00:38:19,989 --> 00:38:21,423
What are you doing?

716
00:38:21,491 --> 00:38:22,925
Coming with you.

717
00:38:22,992 --> 00:38:24,926
Give it a rest, Izzy.

718
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:33,970
You going to ring the doorbell?

719
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:45,705
We've reached
the insane asylum stage.

720
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,285
You know, those "ripoffs” were
the one thing I invented...

721
00:38:50,353 --> 00:38:52,287
that your mom thought
was halfway useful.

722
00:38:52,355 --> 00:38:53,948
I guess that's because
they kept Percival...

723
00:38:54,023 --> 00:38:56,117
and Gideon from
getting overheated.

724
00:38:56,192 --> 00:38:58,456
What about the hand-warmer
you made for Alfred...

725
00:38:58,528 --> 00:39:00,292
when he was playing
the piano?

726
00:39:00,363 --> 00:39:02,730
And the iridescent
pajamas for the twins...

727
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:05,063
so Mom could tell them
apart in the dark?

728
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,431
Strokes of genius.

729
00:39:06,502 --> 00:39:09,665
How come you never
invented anything for me?

730
00:39:09,739 --> 00:39:12,401
I don't remember you
around much, Izzy.

731
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,967
Could you stop
making all that noise?

732
00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:16,409
It's distracting.

733
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,913
I was there.

734
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,915
You just didn't notice me
a whole hell of a lot...

735
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,418
because you were always running
with Percival and Gideon.

736
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,919
Well, you could have
come along.

737
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:27,480
Right. I was the one who always
got a "D" in gym, remember?

738
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:31,491
Dad, I was thinking.

739
00:39:31,561 --> 00:39:35,327
Maybe these eye attacks
are related to stress.

740
00:39:35,398 --> 00:39:37,093
Yeah? Well,
if that was the case...

741
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,429
I probably
would have gone blind...

742
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,526
a week after I met your mother.

743
00:39:46,442 --> 00:39:51,608
Well, no. No, Grandma.

744
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:54,946
Grandma, we haven't heard
anything yet.

745
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,316
Yes, it's hard.

746
00:39:57,387 --> 00:40:00,687
It's...it's awful.

747
00:40:11,401 --> 00:40:13,335
You know, I didn't
really want Alfred.

748
00:40:13,403 --> 00:40:16,338
I was eighteen.
I just wanted to have fun.

749
00:40:16,406 --> 00:40:17,805
But, of course, when he came...

750
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:24,337
he was the world's only baby,
so sweet and so cute.

751
00:40:24,414 --> 00:40:26,348
And then along came Gideon...

752
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:28,851
Percival,
and all the other guys...

753
00:40:28,918 --> 00:40:31,148
and that was it for me.

754
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,689
Yep. It's hard.

755
00:40:36,926 --> 00:40:39,861
How did you manage to
become a psychologist...

756
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:43,388
have two kids, get a divorce,
snare Alfred...

757
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,367
still make a great meat loaf?

758
00:40:45,435 --> 00:40:46,834
By the way, you might
want to just try...

759
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,894
a little bit of this,
all right?

760
00:40:52,942 --> 00:40:56,879
I'd say Alfred did
the major share of the snaring.

761
00:40:56,946 --> 00:40:59,381
I was very leery.
He's so...

762
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:00,712
Young.

763
00:41:02,852 --> 00:41:03,944
Yes, he is that.

764
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,114
And neat.

765
00:41:06,189 --> 00:41:07,122
That, too.

766
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,316
And responsible.

767
00:41:08,391 --> 00:41:09,859
That, three.

768
00:41:12,195 --> 00:41:13,959
I robbed him of his life.

769
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,328
It's my fault he grew up
without any passion.

770
00:41:16,399 --> 00:41:18,333
Oh, I don't know about that.

771
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:20,130
I'd say somewhere
along the line...

772
00:41:20,203 --> 00:41:22,171
he found plenty of passion.

773
00:41:30,913 --> 00:41:31,880
Really?

774
00:42:03,746 --> 00:42:05,544
A marine
out on perimeter duty...

775
00:42:05,615 --> 00:42:08,607
was shooting this home video
to be sent to his family...

776
00:42:08,684 --> 00:42:10,209
when the blast occurred.

777
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:17,787
To update us now
on the situation in the Sinai...

778
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,455
we have on the phone
our reporter Nick Zarron.

779
00:42:21,531 --> 00:42:23,966
Nick, what can you tell us?

780
00:42:24,033 --> 00:42:27,298
I haven't seen carnage
like this since Beirut.

781
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:30,465
It's like
the ground is crying out.

782
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,066
There's so many trapped men.

783
00:42:33,142 --> 00:42:36,112
As we can see, rescue efforts
are still frantically...

784
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,578
continuing throughout the night.

785
00:42:37,647 --> 00:42:40,116
I want to donate a kidney.

786
00:42:41,818 --> 00:42:44,287
That's enough of this.
Let's cash it in.

787
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:47,379
I can't believe last night
at this time nothing was wrong.

788
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,023
Merle, come on.

789
00:42:54,564 --> 00:42:57,659
What is that animal
doing back in the house?

790
00:42:57,733 --> 00:42:59,428
Mom, it's really cold out there.

791
00:42:59,502 --> 00:43:01,129
She's been out all day long.
Have a heart.

792
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:03,434
She doesn't choose
to sleep with you.

793
00:43:03,506 --> 00:43:04,996
It's only a cat, Mother.

794
00:43:05,074 --> 00:43:07,270
With her whiskers and
bad breath in my face...

795
00:43:07,343 --> 00:43:08,777
and her tail and butt
in your father's--

796
00:43:08,845 --> 00:43:10,438
I mean, when he was
living in the house.

797
00:43:10,513 --> 00:43:12,447
Well, at least
you get the good end.

798
00:43:12,515 --> 00:43:13,812
If you think
it's such a great idea...

799
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,009
then why don't you
sleep with her?

800
00:43:15,084 --> 00:43:17,951
-Fine. I will.
-Great.

801
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,284
Look, we're so tired,
we're sniping at each other.

802
00:43:20,356 --> 00:43:21,755
Come on. Let's hit the sack.

803
00:43:25,494 --> 00:43:26,484
Good night, sweetie.

804
00:43:35,605 --> 00:43:37,164
Where are you planning
on sleeping tonight?

805
00:43:40,109 --> 00:43:41,338
In my bed.

806
00:43:50,553 --> 00:43:53,386
You know, back to back,
no touching.

807
00:44:00,563 --> 00:44:04,625
I was hoping we could
have a conversation.

808
00:44:06,002 --> 00:44:07,970
There's nothing to say.

809
00:44:11,007 --> 00:44:14,466
This is sort of
the reason I left.

810
00:44:17,513 --> 00:44:20,278
You left because
I told you to leave.

811
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,615
I left because I figured
if I was going to be alone...

812
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:29,089
I could do that by myself.

813
00:44:29,892 --> 00:44:31,291
You left
because I told you to leave.

814
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,293
It was my decision.

815
00:44:32,361 --> 00:44:33,795
Don't try to take that from me.

816
00:44:33,863 --> 00:44:34,955
Your decision?

817
00:44:35,031 --> 00:44:36,294
Yes. I told you to leave.

818
00:44:36,365 --> 00:44:37,628
You have a really,
really bad memory.

819
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,135
I don't have a bad memory.
I have an excellent--

820
00:44:40,202 --> 00:44:41,795
Anything that's important, I
remember perfectly.

821
00:44:41,871 --> 00:44:43,464
What day did Alfred graduate...

822
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:45,132
from elementary school,
for instance?

823
00:44:45,207 --> 00:44:48,336
Huh? June 27, 1982.

824
00:44:48,411 --> 00:44:50,470
What does that have
to do with anything?

825
00:44:50,546 --> 00:44:51,980
What day of the week
were we married?

826
00:44:52,048 --> 00:44:53,311
What day of the week?

827
00:44:53,382 --> 00:44:55,476
It was a Monday,
about 10:00 a.m...

828
00:44:55,551 --> 00:44:56,746
Little Chapel of Bliss...

829
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,480
and the judge's name
was Wilfred--

830
00:44:58,554 --> 00:45:00,579
It was
the Little Chapel of Harmony.

831
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,885
-Bliss!
-It was Harmony!

832
00:45:04,427 --> 00:45:07,362
All right, I don't
remember who was there...

833
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:08,761
and what time it was...

834
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,128
and what day
of the week it was...

835
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:12,258
because all I saw
and all I cared about was you.

836
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:15,396
I was so madly in love
with you. I was so happy.

837
00:45:19,442 --> 00:45:21,604
Well, what happened?

838
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,304
I mean...

839
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,911
What do you want, Mag?

840
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,121
I want a different life.

841
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:34,452
I never chose this one.

842
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,719
Well, who did?
Don't tell me it was me.

843
00:45:36,792 --> 00:45:38,954
I didn't demand that we
have seven kids, you know.

844
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:41,258
I didn't say
you had to be cranky...

845
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:44,698
and angry and unhappy
all the time.

846
00:45:44,767 --> 00:45:47,464
I'm going to take that
civil-service exam.

847
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,766
And if I pass it,
I'm going to take the job.

848
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,273
Well, good. Good.
That's good.

849
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,774
A lot of people have jobs.

850
00:45:52,842 --> 00:45:54,367
A lot of unhappy people
have jobs.

851
00:45:54,443 --> 00:45:56,138
Patrick, don't make fun of me.

852
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:58,544
I swear to God,
I'm going to take you...

853
00:45:58,614 --> 00:45:59,706
right out of this bed
and kill you...

854
00:45:59,782 --> 00:46:01,181
if you start making
a joke out of this.

855
00:46:03,853 --> 00:46:05,287
Don't start that.

856
00:46:05,354 --> 00:46:06,583
Come here.

857
00:46:06,655 --> 00:46:08,384
It's not funny!

858
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,318
OK. I am cranky, and I'm--

859
00:46:43,025 --> 00:46:44,288
I don't want to be cranky.

860
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:47,227
I don't like being cranky.

861
00:46:47,296 --> 00:46:50,789
I used to be able to
laugh at your jokes.

862
00:46:50,866 --> 00:46:53,301
I can't laugh at them anymore.

863
00:46:53,369 --> 00:46:56,464
Because whenever I do...

864
00:46:56,539 --> 00:46:59,008
I just feel like I'm
giving in to something.

865
00:46:59,075 --> 00:47:01,203
I don't even know what it is.

866
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:02,745
That's pretty funny.

867
00:47:06,015 --> 00:47:07,483
I'm sorry.

868
00:47:10,586 --> 00:47:12,452
Patrick?

869
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:10,771
Oh, I thought it was...

870
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,315
See, they send
an officer to tell...

871
00:48:13,382 --> 00:48:14,679
Gideon, it's you.

872
00:48:16,952 --> 00:48:18,920
Oh, Gideon.

873
00:48:20,556 --> 00:48:22,923
Oh, honey, welcome home.

874
00:49:05,034 --> 00:49:08,163
That's the way it
was supposed to be.

875
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:09,932
Percival winning.

876
00:49:12,341 --> 00:49:15,333
Hell, I only ran to be with him.

877
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:19,314
You know, train with him,
hang out with him.

878
00:49:19,381 --> 00:49:23,045
Dad always said,
"If you're going to pass...

879
00:49:23,118 --> 00:49:24,552
"you have to
blow around the guy...

880
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,645
"so he won't re-pass you.

881
00:49:26,722 --> 00:49:28,053
"So you break his heart.

882
00:49:28,123 --> 00:49:31,058
"He won't have the will
to catch up again.”

883
00:49:31,126 --> 00:49:34,460
That day it sort of kicked in.

884
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:37,295
He hated me after that day.

885
00:49:37,366 --> 00:49:38,856
Oh, sweetheart.

886
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:42,299
You can't blame
yourself for winning.

887
00:49:42,371 --> 00:49:43,998
It was like I didn't even exist.

888
00:49:44,073 --> 00:49:46,007
Look, you work harder
than Percival.

889
00:49:46,075 --> 00:49:47,668
And you don't give up.

890
00:49:47,743 --> 00:49:48,972
You should be proud of that.

891
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,013
You go on upstairs
and get some sleep, OK?

892
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:56,575
I'll make you some French toast
when you get up.

893
00:50:08,597 --> 00:50:10,531
What's the matter
with your legs?

894
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,002
It's just...
it's a case of the flu.

895
00:50:59,648 --> 00:51:00,945
Oh, Percival.

896
00:51:10,592 --> 00:51:12,082
I hate you!

897
00:51:14,997 --> 00:51:16,522
I'm not going to
tell you again!

898
00:51:16,598 --> 00:51:18,032
Let go of him! He can't--

899
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,534
Stop it! You're killing him!

900
00:51:19,601 --> 00:51:21,160
He can't breathe!

901
00:51:21,236 --> 00:51:22,169
Percival, let go!

902
00:51:22,237 --> 00:51:24,228
I'm going to stop this car!

903
00:51:25,507 --> 00:51:26,531
Stop it! He can't--

904
00:51:26,608 --> 00:51:28,042
All right, I'm going to--

905
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:29,737
Did you hear what I said?

906
00:51:29,812 --> 00:51:31,803
Mommy, they're killing me!

907
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,781
All right,
I'm stopping this car!

908
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:41,546
Let go of him!
You're strangling--

909
00:51:41,623 --> 00:51:44,285
He can't breathe!

910
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:30,263
I beat you!

911
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,464
Are you really leaving?

912
00:52:56,532 --> 00:52:58,466
That's between
your father and I.

913
00:52:58,534 --> 00:53:01,003
Oh, like it doesn't
affect the rest of us.

914
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,906
Are you still living
with that sweet little girl?

915
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,908
What's her name,
Cindy or Mindy...

916
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,705
or something like that?

917
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,415
Must be really
difficult for the girls.

918
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:15,917
I mean, you are so handsome.

919
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:19,352
And with this beard,
it makes you look so old.

920
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,423
Well, if you do find
a significant other...

921
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:24,425
please bring her home
so I can meet her.

922
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:27,121
Well, how can 1?
You won't be here.

923
00:53:27,196 --> 00:53:28,823
Everybody's up early.

924
00:53:28,897 --> 00:53:30,422
Oh, no. Not in this house.

925
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:32,433
Out you go. Come on.

926
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:33,764
Is this for me, Izzy?

927
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:35,429
It is now.

928
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:36,938
Thanks.

929
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,474
Go join your little cat friends.

930
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:48,381
Gideon came home last night.

931
00:53:52,321 --> 00:53:55,154
He pulled out the old video
of his race with Percival.

932
00:53:55,224 --> 00:53:56,248
He feels so guilty.

933
00:53:56,325 --> 00:53:57,451
He's walking around
like he's a hundred.

934
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,358
He says it's the flu.

935
00:54:03,465 --> 00:54:04,899
Oh, God damn.

936
00:54:04,967 --> 00:54:07,527
Izzy, get the pills.

937
00:54:07,603 --> 00:54:08,570
Why now?

938
00:54:08,637 --> 00:54:09,604
Get the pills, Izzy.

939
00:54:09,671 --> 00:54:12,504
I don't understand.

940
00:54:12,574 --> 00:54:13,905
I was right here.

941
00:54:13,976 --> 00:54:15,535
It doesn't make any sense.

942
00:54:15,611 --> 00:54:17,511
I mean, he came down,
and he seemed fine.

943
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:19,513
He had some tea
and looked at the paper...

944
00:54:19,581 --> 00:54:20,810
and then boom!

945
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,715
I can't figure it out.

946
00:54:22,784 --> 00:54:26,084
I mean, this is a crisis, and
I can't do anything about it.

947
00:54:26,154 --> 00:54:27,246
You can answer the door.

948
00:54:27,322 --> 00:54:28,949
Go ahead. I've got
your father's pills.

949
00:54:30,492 --> 00:54:31,687
All right, I'm coming.

950
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,058
I've got your pills.

951
00:54:43,372 --> 00:54:48,538
I know this must seem like
a convenient way out...

952
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:51,580
but it just comes on me.

953
00:54:54,616 --> 00:54:56,084
Wait.

954
00:55:06,628 --> 00:55:08,426
Come on in, come on in.

955
00:55:08,497 --> 00:55:09,794
We just had to tell you.

956
00:55:09,865 --> 00:55:11,924
Tim just called me.
He's all right.

957
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,866
He was out on the perimeter
of the compound.

958
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:15,335
Well, do you know
where Percival was?

959
00:55:15,404 --> 00:55:16,462
I mean, did he know?

960
00:55:16,538 --> 00:55:20,270
The last time Tim saw
Percival was days ago.

961
00:55:20,342 --> 00:55:22,709
Really, he hadn't
seen him all weekend.

962
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:23,768
Where was Percival then?

963
00:55:23,845 --> 00:55:26,041
He was in the building.

964
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,708
The building that was bombed?

965
00:55:32,054 --> 00:55:34,989
Yes, but he could have
been on leave or...

966
00:55:36,058 --> 00:55:37,492
out in another perimeter.

967
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:38,993
It's so confusing
over there...

968
00:55:39,061 --> 00:55:40,495
Tim couldn't get
any information.

969
00:55:40,562 --> 00:55:42,121
Mom, it doesn't mean anything.

970
00:55:43,565 --> 00:55:45,465
I'm going to get dressed...

971
00:55:45,534 --> 00:55:48,026
and go take
my civil-service exam.

972
00:55:52,074 --> 00:55:53,542
Mag?

973
00:55:54,743 --> 00:55:57,007
Mom?

974
00:55:57,079 --> 00:55:59,514
Yeah?

975
00:55:59,581 --> 00:56:01,447
Look at those trophies.

976
00:56:01,516 --> 00:56:03,450
Which ones did I win?

977
00:56:03,518 --> 00:56:05,486
Which ones are Percival's?

978
00:56:07,022 --> 00:56:08,456
Can't tell, can you?
You know why?

979
00:56:08,523 --> 00:56:09,957
Because it doesn't matter.

980
00:56:10,025 --> 00:56:12,960
Mine or Percival's,
it's all the same.

981
00:56:13,028 --> 00:56:14,291
No. I had Percival...

982
00:56:14,363 --> 00:56:15,956
then fourteen months later
I had you.

983
00:56:16,031 --> 00:56:17,260
You're a separate person.

984
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:19,892
It's my fault if he's dead.

985
00:56:20,936 --> 00:56:23,462
I beat him,
and he quit running...

986
00:56:23,538 --> 00:56:26,235
and then he met Tim O'Neal,
and he joined the Marines...

987
00:56:26,308 --> 00:56:27,469
and they sent him to Sinai.

988
00:56:27,542 --> 00:56:29,704
Now he's probably dead
because of me!

989
00:56:29,778 --> 00:56:31,473
I threw him
out of the car.

990
00:56:31,546 --> 00:56:32,877
That's what
started him running.

991
00:56:32,948 --> 00:56:35,007
Maybe it's my fault.

992
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:39,282
Well, maybe it is
your fault.

993
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,789
Or maybe it's
your father's fault.

994
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,120
If he hadn't been
so irresistible...

995
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,283
then we wouldn't
have had sex.

996
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,123
And if his sperm hadn't
been such great swimmers...

997
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,457
then maybe they wouldn't
have reached the egg...

998
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:52,330
Mom. Look, Mom,
I got the picture.

999
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,805
Finding somebody to blame
isn't going to make him safe.

1000
00:57:05,947 --> 00:57:09,906
This was a great race,
and it was yours.

1001
00:57:20,462 --> 00:57:22,089
Mrs. Singer!

1002
00:57:22,164 --> 00:57:23,598
One question, Mrs. Singer.

1003
00:57:23,665 --> 00:57:25,497
I know this is
a difficult time for you.

1004
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,968
One question, Mrs. Singer.

1005
00:57:29,471 --> 00:57:30,905
Look at me! Look over here!

1006
00:57:30,972 --> 00:57:32,406
Look at me!

1007
00:57:32,474 --> 00:57:35,933
Mrs. Singer! Look at me!

1008
00:57:38,346 --> 00:57:40,781
Red Cross units are
being flown into the Sinai...

1009
00:57:40,849 --> 00:57:42,749
to give aid and comfort
to the growing number...

1010
00:57:42,818 --> 00:57:44,308
of wounded marines
injured in the...

1011
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,909
Nice fire, Percival.

1012
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,344
What are you using for kindling?

1013
00:58:11,413 --> 00:58:15,680
This is Newton's Second Law
of Thermodynamics.

1014
00:58:15,751 --> 00:58:17,583
That must burn pretty well.

1015
00:58:17,652 --> 00:58:19,916
Yeah. Funny how it
works out that way.

1016
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:26,484
You know how I feel
about smoking dope.

1017
00:58:26,561 --> 00:58:29,394
You know, how can you
be so self-righteous...

1018
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,933
about something you've
never even tried?

1019
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:38,235
All right. Let me try it.

1020
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:39,967
What?

1021
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:41,873
Let me try it.

1022
00:58:41,943 --> 00:58:44,469
Clearly you're
not going to listen...

1023
00:58:44,546 --> 00:58:47,481
to a thing I have to say
unless I speak from experience.

1024
00:58:47,549 --> 00:58:50,519
So why don't you help me
gather some experience?

1025
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:54,385
I think you've lost it.

1026
00:58:54,456 --> 00:58:57,118
Well, maybe, but let me...

1027
00:58:57,192 --> 00:58:58,182
Seriously?

1028
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,227
Yeah.

1029
00:59:06,635 --> 00:59:08,433
Take a deep breath...

1030
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:09,732
and then hold it
in your lungs...

1031
00:59:09,805 --> 00:59:11,671
till they feel like
they're going to burst.

1032
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,952
Don't laugh. That's strong.

1033
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,988
Just wait.

1034
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,522
This is pretty cool, Mom.

1035
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:41,469
This is pretty good.

1036
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:42,799
Yeah?

1037
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:45,807
So what classes are we cutting?

1038
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:51,308
French...

1039
00:59:52,514 --> 00:59:54,539
English...and History.

1040
00:59:54,616 --> 00:59:57,984
What a coincidence!
All the classes you're flunking.

1041
00:59:58,053 --> 00:59:59,316
Yeah, so what?

1042
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,788
Well, so you're not going
to graduate, that's what.

1043
01:00:01,857 --> 01:00:03,120
Doesn't matter.

1044
01:00:03,191 --> 01:00:04,386
I'm not going to college anyway.

1045
01:00:04,459 --> 01:00:06,951
Great. Just great.

1046
01:00:07,028 --> 01:00:10,089
You flunk a few classes,
so you quit school.

1047
01:00:10,165 --> 01:00:11,291
Your brother beats you
in one race.

1048
01:00:11,366 --> 01:00:12,458
You quit the team.

1049
01:00:12,534 --> 01:00:15,128
You can't play the guitar like
Jimmy Page in three lessons?

1050
01:00:15,203 --> 01:00:16,170
You quit.

1051
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:18,297
Doesn't this seem to
be some kind of pattern?

1052
01:00:18,373 --> 01:00:20,501
You know, Percival...

1053
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,509
the minute something
starts to get too hard...

1054
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,740
or you can't do it immediately,
you just bail out.

1055
01:00:25,814 --> 01:00:27,304
You quit it, and you say...

1056
01:00:27,382 --> 01:00:28,975
"I'm out of the woods now."
But it's not true.

1057
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:30,814
You're not out of the woods.
because...

1058
01:00:30,886 --> 01:00:32,320
the woods are all around you.

1059
01:00:32,387 --> 01:00:35,015
I mean, I'm in the woods,
you're in the woods.

1060
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,524
There's always
something difficult...

1061
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,922
that's going to
present itself.

1062
01:00:37,993 --> 01:00:39,654
Like some big tree,
some redwood.

1063
01:00:39,728 --> 01:00:41,662
Some majestic,
some mystical redwood...

1064
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:44,165
pops up or some kind
of little fir tree.

1065
01:00:44,232 --> 01:00:46,997
You turn around, and there's
some little fir tree...

1066
01:00:47,068 --> 01:00:49,264
sitting there,
or some dogwood is...

1067
01:00:49,337 --> 01:00:50,827
you know,
somewhere else.

1068
01:00:50,906 --> 01:00:52,840
And you're just,
because you're--

1069
01:00:52,908 --> 01:00:54,535
I mean--

1070
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:59,547
Life is the woods,
is what I'm trying to say.

1071
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:02,481
Yeah, that's--
that's very deep, Mom.

1072
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:05,315
You're very deep
when you're stoned.

1073
01:01:08,056 --> 01:01:10,491
I guess that's a little...

1074
01:01:10,558 --> 01:01:12,458
It was a little heavy.

1075
01:01:12,527 --> 01:01:14,017
Majestic tree.

1076
01:01:18,233 --> 01:01:20,531
You're totally out of it.

1077
01:01:29,577 --> 01:01:31,807
Percy, you're absent
from your own life.

1078
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,507
It's breaking my heart.

1079
01:01:37,585 --> 01:01:41,818
You know, not once...

1080
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:45,019
Not one time in
my whole rotten life...

1081
01:01:45,093 --> 01:01:47,187
have I gotten
one thing that I want.

1082
01:01:47,262 --> 01:01:48,991
What? What is it?

1083
01:01:49,064 --> 01:01:51,533
I want to live in a family
where I'm not compared.

1084
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:54,933
Alfred is the oldest.
Izzy is the brain.

1085
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:56,471
The twins are the twins.

1086
01:01:56,538 --> 01:02:00,475
And now Gideon is the runner.

1087
01:02:00,542 --> 01:02:03,409
Percival? Yeah.

1088
01:02:03,478 --> 01:02:05,412
Percival's the difficult one.

1089
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,177
How do you think
that makes me feel?

1090
01:02:08,249 --> 01:02:10,877
I'm sorry.
I'm doing the best I can.

1091
01:02:10,952 --> 01:02:14,411
Yeah, well, what does
that say about you, Mom?

1092
01:02:20,996 --> 01:02:23,522
I'm joining the Marines,
me and Tim.

1093
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:27,964
I'm old enough.
You can't stop me.

1094
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:03,938
Margaret Singer.

1095
01:03:06,474 --> 01:03:07,908
Dad?

1096
01:03:07,976 --> 01:03:10,104
Are you all right?

1097
01:03:13,481 --> 01:03:16,917
Do you want me to come in?

1098
01:03:16,985 --> 01:03:18,453
Yeah.

1099
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:24,425
Can you see?

1100
01:03:24,492 --> 01:03:27,928
It's starting to come back.

1101
01:03:27,996 --> 01:03:31,455
The shower.
Maybe it did some good.

1102
01:03:33,501 --> 01:03:36,471
It's never happened
two days in a row before.

1103
01:03:38,006 --> 01:03:40,668
It's getting worse.

1104
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:43,603
What do you think,
it's an omen?!

1105
01:03:43,678 --> 01:03:44,804
Do you think God
is interested...

1106
01:03:44,879 --> 01:03:46,643
whether or not you pass
your civil-service test?

1107
01:03:46,714 --> 01:03:47,647
I should be dead, and I'm not.

1108
01:03:47,715 --> 01:03:48,682
It's a sign.

1109
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,047
Yeah, but a sign of what?

1110
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:51,779
That I shouldn't take the job.

1111
01:03:51,853 --> 01:03:53,321
Well, how do you know it
isn't a sign that you should?

1112
01:03:53,388 --> 01:03:55,982
No. God wanted me to stop.
I didn't stop.

1113
01:03:56,057 --> 01:03:57,650
He wants me to stay
at home for the boys.

1114
01:03:57,725 --> 01:03:59,887
Maggie,
let me tell you something.

1115
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,952
You're a fruitcake,
you know that?

1116
01:04:03,164 --> 01:04:05,258
Life is capricious,
and you have to be vigilant...

1117
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:06,425
and watch the signs.

1118
01:04:06,501 --> 01:04:08,765
Yeah, but things happen
to you anyway, Maggie...

1119
01:04:08,837 --> 01:04:09,895
no matter how much you worry.

1120
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:11,598
I'm not going to
talk about Percival...

1121
01:04:11,673 --> 01:04:14,108
and if I pass the test,
I'm still not taking the job.

1122
01:04:14,175 --> 01:04:18,737
Oh, well, well, well.
Now we see.

1123
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:19,905
You're nothing but hot air.

1124
01:04:23,251 --> 01:04:25,413
Let me tell you a secret.

1125
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:27,683
God likes a go-getter.

1126
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,793
I think I passed the test.

1127
01:04:35,864 --> 01:04:37,298
I mean, everybody there
was really young...

1128
01:04:37,365 --> 01:04:38,457
and just out of college...

1129
01:04:38,533 --> 01:04:42,492
but I had life experience
and common sense.

1130
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:46,871
I know I passed it.

1131
01:04:46,941 --> 01:04:47,242
There is speculation
the explosion was caused...

1132
01:04:47,242 --> 01:04:49,301
There is speculation
the explosion was caused...

1133
01:04:49,377 --> 01:04:51,846
by a highly combustible
plastic explosive.

1134
01:04:51,913 --> 01:04:53,938
Traces of ammonium nitrate
at the site...

1135
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,450
led investigators to believe
that Semtex...

1136
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:59,453
or C4 as it's called,
was the cause of the blast.

1137
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:00,955
As of now, no known group...

1138
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,080
Hey, Gideon?

1139
01:05:02,157 --> 01:05:04,626
Why don't you come on in here
and play a round?

1140
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:16,967
What's the matter with you?

1141
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:18,563
It's just the flu, you know.

1142
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:19,732
You got a fever or what?

1143
01:05:19,807 --> 01:05:23,072
No, I don't think so.

1144
01:05:23,144 --> 01:05:24,578
Stomach?

1145
01:05:24,646 --> 01:05:27,047
I don't know what it is.

1146
01:05:27,115 --> 01:05:28,947
Come on, let's get out
of here. Get some air.

1147
01:05:29,017 --> 01:05:30,951
Dad, I can't. I'm sick.

1148
01:05:31,019 --> 01:05:32,453
I need you to drive
me somewhere.

1149
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,954
I better drive you, Dad.

1150
01:05:34,022 --> 01:05:35,387
No. I want Gideon to drive.

1151
01:05:37,025 --> 01:05:38,117
Dad, where are you going?

1152
01:05:38,193 --> 01:05:39,627
Out.

1153
01:05:39,694 --> 01:05:41,526
From you?
Just a couple of words?

1154
01:05:41,596 --> 01:05:42,995
Nobody's been in contact?
They haven't called you?

1155
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:45,465
Have they called you?

1156
01:05:45,533 --> 01:05:47,001
Has anyone--

1157
01:05:50,538 --> 01:05:52,506
Shit.

1158
01:06:00,548 --> 01:06:02,482
Vultures.

1159
01:06:11,993 --> 01:06:13,620
Mrs. Singer?

1160
01:06:13,695 --> 01:06:15,493
Mrs. Singer!
Can we talk to you just--

1161
01:06:15,563 --> 01:06:18,328
Do you have any information
about your son?

1162
01:06:18,399 --> 01:06:19,992
Do you think he's
still alive, Mrs. Singer?

1163
01:06:20,068 --> 01:06:22,002
What do you think
Percival's chances are?

1164
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:24,164
Tim O'Neal says he saw
him in the building...

1165
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:25,172
before it was bombed.

1166
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:26,332
Have you heard
that the Marines...

1167
01:06:26,407 --> 01:06:28,171
are only recovering
dead bodies now?

1168
01:06:28,243 --> 01:06:29,677
Do you have any hope
that he might be alive?

1169
01:06:29,744 --> 01:06:31,872
Have they contacted you,
Mrs. Singer?

1170
01:06:32,914 --> 01:06:34,712
Fuck off.

1171
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,011
Mom!

1172
01:06:36,084 --> 01:06:37,916
That's something
they can't say on TV.

1173
01:06:43,091 --> 01:06:45,025
Can't do this.
Cannot do this.

1174
01:06:45,093 --> 01:06:48,222
Mother! Mom!

1175
01:06:50,098 --> 01:06:51,532
Mom, you turned off my alarm!

1176
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:53,533
Why? Why didn't you
wake me up?

1177
01:06:53,601 --> 01:06:55,695
I couldn't sleep,
so I was up anyway.

1178
01:06:55,770 --> 01:06:57,204
Well, what about my route?

1179
01:06:57,272 --> 01:06:59,036
How did you even know
which houses to do?

1180
01:06:59,107 --> 01:07:01,098
It was fine.

1181
01:07:01,175 --> 01:07:02,142
Look, I needed something
to do, that's all.

1182
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:03,974
Well, so did I!
Did you ever think of that?

1183
01:07:04,045 --> 01:07:06,412
No! You are
the most selfish person.

1184
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:08,381
Then clean the garage.
That's something to do.

1185
01:07:08,449 --> 01:07:10,042
I don't want to do that!

1186
01:07:10,118 --> 01:07:11,552
Ah, that's not
the right something.

1187
01:07:11,619 --> 01:07:13,053
I see we're testing
"Mefistofele”...

1188
01:07:13,121 --> 01:07:15,852
for its ability to deaden
the auditory nerves.

1189
01:07:15,923 --> 01:07:17,550
Tim O'Neal called his mother.

1190
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:19,559
The last time he saw Percival...

1191
01:07:19,627 --> 01:07:21,857
Percival was in
the headquarters building.

1192
01:07:21,929 --> 01:07:26,992
Well, we can't draw
conclusions from that.

1193
01:07:27,068 --> 01:07:28,695
He was in the building
that was bombed.

1194
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:29,931
Not necessarily
at that moment.

1195
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,403
Oh, Alfred, if you're going
to keep splitting hairs...

1196
01:07:31,472 --> 01:07:32,667
please, you're just...

1197
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:33,969
Yes. Assume the absolute worst.

1198
01:07:34,042 --> 01:07:35,237
It's really best for everyone.

1199
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:36,709
It really helps.

1200
01:07:36,778 --> 01:07:38,974
So glad I came home!

1201
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:43,006
I'd feel the same way you do.

1202
01:07:43,084 --> 01:07:47,214
I'd feel like, "Oh, my God.
He was in that building.”

1203
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:54,291
Did you see the pictures
of the building--

1204
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:55,295
what's left of it?

1205
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:57,730
Yes, on the news.

1206
01:07:57,799 --> 01:07:59,460
Percival was always
my most difficult child.

1207
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:03,232
I never seemed to be able
to make him happy.

1208
01:08:03,304 --> 01:08:06,569
But then, this past summer
when he came home on leave...

1209
01:08:06,641 --> 01:08:10,236
he seemed to have found
some kind of inner peace.

1210
01:08:10,311 --> 01:08:12,439
He needed to be away,
do you understand?

1211
01:08:16,984 --> 01:08:20,420
So let him not be absent.

1212
01:08:20,488 --> 01:08:22,422
Let him be present
at the bombing.

1213
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:23,924
Let him survive it.

1214
01:08:23,991 --> 01:08:25,925
And let him get
the strength from that...

1215
01:08:25,993 --> 01:08:28,462
to be present
in the rest of his life.

1216
01:08:30,498 --> 01:08:33,433
I'm asking too much,
aren't I?

1217
01:08:35,002 --> 01:08:38,461
That's what every good
mother would want.

1218
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:46,604
You got to keep
your head down.

1219
01:08:46,681 --> 01:08:49,241
Keep low, OK?
Keep a fluid line.

1220
01:08:49,317 --> 01:08:51,911
You're crazy, man.
I'm out of here.

1221
01:08:51,986 --> 01:08:53,078
What are you
going to do, quit?

1222
01:08:53,154 --> 01:08:55,020
No. Never, never
in my entire life...

1223
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:56,523
have I ever quit anything.

1224
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:58,116
Percival is the quitter.

1225
01:08:58,192 --> 01:09:00,024
You're mixing up your sons.

1226
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,459
I know which son
I got right in front of me.

1227
01:09:01,529 --> 01:09:03,964
Yeah, the one you always
screamed and yelled at.

1228
01:09:04,031 --> 01:09:05,465
Why me, Dad, huh?

1229
01:09:05,533 --> 01:09:07,467
Why was it always me that you
screamed and yelled at...

1230
01:09:07,535 --> 01:09:08,730
more than anyone else?

1231
01:09:08,803 --> 01:09:10,999
‘Cause it worked.
It made you a winner.

1232
01:09:11,072 --> 01:09:13,541
No, you're wrong.
I made myself a winner.

1233
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:16,077
So stop yelling at me.

1234
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:30,056
Mom?

1235
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:31,057
Oh, shoot.

1236
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,059
That one could
be better. Sorry.

1237
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,061
You're just in time.

1238
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:37,063
Here, you want something?

1239
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,725
Try it. It's fun!

1240
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:42,395
You're supposed to send these
to Aunt Charlotte.

1241
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:45,030
She's dead. Just toss it.

1242
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:49,306
That's it.

1243
01:09:49,377 --> 01:09:50,344
Not bad.

1244
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,513
Score for the Singers!

1245
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,711
And he's off!

1246
01:10:01,088 --> 01:10:03,853
Ah, ready! On your mark!

1247
01:10:03,925 --> 01:10:06,587
Get set!

1248
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:08,595
Go!

1249
01:10:10,731 --> 01:10:13,063
The flying Singers!
Let's have it, boys! Yes!

1250
01:10:20,475 --> 01:10:23,342
Here's one from Granny Singer!

1251
01:10:26,814 --> 01:10:28,145
I hated that!

1252
01:10:31,486 --> 01:10:32,920
Good-bye, golf.

1253
01:10:32,987 --> 01:10:34,455
Who played golf?

1254
01:10:37,992 --> 01:10:40,461
4.0 difficulty...

1255
01:10:41,996 --> 01:10:43,930
Hang time was good,
but you failed.

1256
01:10:43,998 --> 01:10:45,466
That was a hell of a throw.

1257
01:10:50,004 --> 01:10:52,666
And it's up, and it's good!

1258
01:10:55,009 --> 01:10:55,942
Mother?

1259
01:10:56,010 --> 01:10:57,205
Just a minute, honey.

1260
01:10:57,278 --> 01:10:58,939
Mother, I think you should
come inside now.

1261
01:10:59,013 --> 01:11:01,277
Just come inside. I think--

1262
01:11:01,349 --> 01:11:02,475
We'll clean this up
in the morning.

1263
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:05,315
Izzy, come on.
Just come inside.

1264
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,286
We're not going
to clean it up, Alfred!

1265
01:11:07,355 --> 01:11:09,653
It took me all day
to get it like this!

1266
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:11,021
There's really a lot to--

1267
01:11:11,092 --> 01:11:13,424
Guys, come on!
There's a lot to do inside.

1268
01:11:13,494 --> 01:11:14,893
Mother, just--

1269
01:11:14,962 --> 01:11:15,952
Try this, Alfred.

1270
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:17,520
I don't want
to throw anything.

1271
01:11:17,598 --> 01:11:19,566
I don't want
to throw anything. Please.

1272
01:11:19,634 --> 01:11:21,261
No! It will
make you feel great.

1273
01:11:21,335 --> 01:11:23,565
Hey, I feel fine.
I feel fine.

1274
01:11:23,638 --> 01:11:25,470
How could you
possibly feel fine?

1275
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:26,939
Obviously I'm the only
one feeling fine here.

1276
01:11:27,008 --> 01:11:27,941
Mother, please,
just put it down...

1277
01:11:28,009 --> 01:11:28,942
and come inside,
all right?

1278
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:30,535
Please.

1279
01:11:30,611 --> 01:11:32,045
OK, Alfred. It's all right.

1280
01:11:32,113 --> 01:11:34,275
You go back inside.
We'll take care of this.

1281
01:11:34,348 --> 01:11:35,713
Come on, guys!

1282
01:11:35,783 --> 01:11:37,808
You know,
I hate when you do that!

1283
01:11:37,885 --> 01:11:40,479
I hate when you
assume that you--

1284
01:11:40,555 --> 01:11:41,488
What do you think?

1285
01:11:41,556 --> 01:11:43,547
That I'm utterly incapable--

1286
01:11:43,624 --> 01:11:44,614
Hey, come on!

1287
01:11:44,692 --> 01:11:46,626
You know, I--look, I could--

1288
01:11:46,694 --> 01:11:49,163
You know, I--

1289
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:50,163
Whoo! Good one!

1290
01:11:50,231 --> 01:11:52,359
Hey! Everybody out!

1291
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:53,992
Everybody out of the garage!

1292
01:11:54,068 --> 01:11:56,503
Move it! Move it!

1293
01:11:56,571 --> 01:11:58,039
Put it down!

1294
01:12:04,011 --> 01:12:05,979
Hey, you want to see
something wild?

1295
01:12:20,027 --> 01:12:22,997
You started a fire.

1296
01:12:30,104 --> 01:12:33,472
Alfred, that's so wonderful.

1297
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:35,066
Sweetheart.

1298
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:37,338
You make me crazy!

1299
01:12:37,411 --> 01:12:38,435
But you're going to
have some passion...

1300
01:12:38,512 --> 01:12:39,809
in your life after all.

1301
01:12:41,048 --> 01:12:43,415
Let's hear it for Alfred!

1302
01:12:47,555 --> 01:12:50,752
Oh, it's a beautiful fire.

1303
01:13:00,568 --> 01:13:03,936
Identifying the dead
is a tedious process.

1304
01:13:04,005 --> 01:13:06,940
So far we've accounted
for 147 dead.

1305
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:09,943
But many of the men weren't
wearing their dog tags.

1306
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,445
147.

1307
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:12,707
Is there any hope at all...

1308
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:14,373
that some of the men
are still alive...

1309
01:13:14,448 --> 01:13:15,938
beneath all that rubble?

1310
01:13:16,017 --> 01:13:17,610
We're operating
under that assumption.

1311
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:19,779
We reached
some warm bodies today...

1312
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:21,447
but the men weren't alive.

1313
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:23,456
Simon, can you turn that off?

1314
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:27,358
Marine spokesman reporting from
the site of the bomb blast...

1315
01:13:27,428 --> 01:13:28,953
where hope is fading now
that any more survivors...

1316
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:36,462
Mag, if it's
all right with you...

1317
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:38,938
I'm going to put him upstairs
in Alfred's old room.

1318
01:13:39,006 --> 01:13:40,474
Do you want to go upstairs?

1319
01:13:41,509 --> 01:13:42,943
Simon, can you give me a hand?

1320
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:46,446
You're going to go
up to Alfred's room.

1321
01:13:46,514 --> 01:13:47,948
There you go.

1322
01:13:48,015 --> 01:13:49,449
Come here.

1323
01:13:49,517 --> 01:13:50,450
Thanks.

1324
01:13:50,518 --> 01:13:51,451
Yeah.

1325
01:13:51,519 --> 01:13:56,958
I don't know about you guys,
but I could use a drink.

1326
01:13:57,024 --> 01:13:59,459
Patrick, can I
get you something?

1327
01:13:59,527 --> 01:14:01,393
Mmm...no, thanks.
I'm allergic.

1328
01:14:01,462 --> 01:14:03,396
All liquor, Dad?

1329
01:14:03,464 --> 01:14:06,434
Yeah, just about.
I'll stick to tea.

1330
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:34,417
I'm just trying to figure out
what it is about you...

1331
01:14:34,495 --> 01:14:37,294
that Alfred loves so much.

1332
01:14:37,364 --> 01:14:40,265
Maybe he sees you in me
or me in you.

1333
01:14:40,334 --> 01:14:43,167
I don't know. Who knows?

1334
01:14:43,237 --> 01:14:45,331
Yeah, who knows?

1335
01:14:45,406 --> 01:14:48,842
I mean, Patrick's been after
me for twenty-five years...

1336
01:14:48,909 --> 01:14:50,673
and I still don't know why.

1337
01:14:50,745 --> 01:14:53,271
Twenty-five years. Lucky you.

1338
01:14:53,347 --> 01:14:55,315
Lucky me.

1339
01:14:57,084 --> 01:14:59,178
Lucky me.

1340
01:14:59,253 --> 01:15:01,381
And after all these years,
all he has to do...

1341
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:03,446
is put his hand
on my lower back...

1342
01:15:03,524 --> 01:15:07,188
touch my neck, and I'm gone.

1343
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:11,064
But gone to a better place.

1344
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:13,191
One might even say,
“transported.”

1345
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:20,407
Is that why
you're with Alfred?

1346
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:21,600
That's one reason.

1347
01:15:21,675 --> 01:15:24,303
Let it suffice to say...

1348
01:15:24,378 --> 01:15:27,245
he has his father
in him somewhere.

1349
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:32,475
That's really embarrassing.

1350
01:15:32,553 --> 01:15:34,078
Let's talk
about something else.

1351
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:38,550
He's very good with my sons.

1352
01:15:38,626 --> 01:15:40,424
Another man's sons.

1353
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:42,861
It's too much
responsibility, too soon.

1354
01:15:42,930 --> 01:15:46,924
Oh, I think he's having fun
in his Alfred kind of way.

1355
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:49,936
He's rising to the challenge
like you did.

1356
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:51,438
Are you kidding?

1357
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:53,439
I was a lousy mother.

1358
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:56,442
I always forgot
their permission slips.

1359
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:59,343
Their milk money.
Their socks didn't match.

1360
01:15:59,413 --> 01:16:01,905
I've yet to have a complete
conversation with any of them.

1361
01:16:01,982 --> 01:16:05,441
Well, then who raised
those seven wonderful guys?

1362
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:07,544
I mean, look at them,
every one of them.

1363
01:16:07,621 --> 01:16:10,818
They're every one
of them decent, honest.

1364
01:16:10,891 --> 01:16:12,620
They all love each other.

1365
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:15,390
And they love you.
That's obvious.

1366
01:16:15,462 --> 01:16:16,452
I would be thrilled...

1367
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:19,556
if my boys turned out
like yours.

1368
01:16:19,633 --> 01:16:21,067
Somebody did something right.

1369
01:16:21,135 --> 01:16:22,603
Who was that?

1370
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:26,465
Patrick played with them a lot.

1371
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,008
Well, that's good.

1372
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:33,878
1 did all the boring
maintenance stuff.

1373
01:16:33,948 --> 01:16:35,609
I'll bet you did.

1374
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:42,990
You know, today, when I took
my civil-service exam...

1375
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:46,994
I had to describe myself
in fifty words or less.

1376
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:49,496
So I started out.

1377
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:50,826
I wrote down...

1378
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:53,526
“I'm the mother of seven boys."

1379
01:16:55,035 --> 01:16:56,628
Yeah, right.

1380
01:16:58,205 --> 01:17:00,435
And then I just sat there.

1381
01:17:00,507 --> 01:17:04,375
I couldn't think
of anything to say...

1382
01:17:04,445 --> 01:17:06,846
for forty-five minutes.

1383
01:17:06,914 --> 01:17:08,211
I was sitting there.

1384
01:17:08,282 --> 01:17:09,374
And I couldn't--

1385
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:11,214
I'm the mother of seven sons.

1386
01:17:11,285 --> 01:17:13,754
That's it. Oh, God!

1387
01:17:13,821 --> 01:17:15,653
And that wasn't enough?

1388
01:17:15,723 --> 01:17:17,851
Oh, well, I don't--
I always thought...

1389
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:18,949
there'd be something more.

1390
01:17:19,026 --> 01:17:21,290
You know, one minute,
I'm hot for Patrick.

1391
01:17:21,362 --> 01:17:26,823
And then the next minute,
I'm the mother of seven sons.

1392
01:17:29,036 --> 01:17:32,131
What was that something
more that you wanted?

1393
01:17:32,206 --> 01:17:33,469
Oh, I don't know.

1394
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:35,133
I mean, I was thirty-five
before I had a dinner...

1395
01:17:35,209 --> 01:17:37,007
where I wasn't cutting
somebody else's meat.

1396
01:17:40,714 --> 01:17:41,806
Maybe you're right.

1397
01:17:41,882 --> 01:17:44,146
Maybe you shouldn't have
had all those kids.

1398
01:17:44,218 --> 01:17:47,984
Oh, I can't imagine my life
without any one of my guys.

1399
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:18,918
Honey, it's late.

1400
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:20,454
Mom.

1401
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:23,457
Look.

1402
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:31,488
It was like my feet
didn't even touch the ground.

1403
01:18:31,565 --> 01:18:34,466
I didn't even have to try.

1404
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:37,937
I just ran.

1405
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:40,975
For the pure joy of it.

1406
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:46,469
You were doing
what you were meant to do.

1407
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:11,404
I was happy that day.

1408
01:19:11,472 --> 01:19:14,442
You were so happy that day.
I remember.

1409
01:19:15,976 --> 01:19:17,102
And you were loud.

1410
01:19:17,177 --> 01:19:18,906
I was loud.

1411
01:19:18,979 --> 01:19:20,606
Yeah.

1412
01:19:27,354 --> 01:19:29,550
Turn that damn thing off, Simon.

1413
01:19:43,604 --> 01:19:46,539
Hey, we're going to be late.
Come on.

1414
01:19:46,607 --> 01:19:50,066
This is the day
we're going to find out.

1415
01:19:53,614 --> 01:19:55,582
I'll wait for you downstairs.

1416
01:20:10,130 --> 01:20:11,598
See ya.

1417
01:20:51,371 --> 01:20:53,567
All right. Come on.

1418
01:20:56,543 --> 01:20:57,635
What do you want?

1419
01:20:57,711 --> 01:20:58,837
You want to get me?

1420
01:21:03,083 --> 01:21:04,278
Simon, run!

1421
01:21:04,351 --> 01:21:06,820
Mom!

1422
01:21:06,887 --> 01:21:08,412
Go!

1423
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:09,923
Mom!

1424
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,687
Mom! Stop! Get up!

1425
01:21:12,759 --> 01:21:13,954
Go! Go!

1426
01:21:14,027 --> 01:21:16,655
Mom, stop it!

1427
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:19,427
Mom, stop it. Get up.

1428
01:21:24,571 --> 01:21:26,471
Get up, please.

1429
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:28,474
You're going to kill him.

1430
01:21:28,542 --> 01:21:30,510
You're going to kill him.

1431
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:38,484
Oh, my God.

1432
01:21:38,552 --> 01:21:40,611
Oh, my God.

1433
01:22:14,521 --> 01:22:18,151
This is the third day
in a row, Dad.

1434
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:20,660
I have a theory.

1435
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:22,491
I mean, I think
I've figured it out.

1436
01:22:25,532 --> 01:22:28,263
It wouldn't hurt you
to listen, Dad.

1437
01:22:31,038 --> 01:22:33,006
I don't want you
to tell anybody...

1438
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:34,472
at home about this.

1439
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:39,845
We'll tell them you fell...

1440
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:46,349
We'll tell them you tripped
on the Swansons' lawn.

1441
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:49,185
All right. You know
where that big rock is?

1442
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:51,190
That's why you're so dirty...

1443
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:52,817
because the lawn
was really muddy.

1444
01:22:56,063 --> 01:23:00,500
Maybe we could even say that
they left the hose running.

1445
01:23:00,567 --> 01:23:02,433
They'll believe us.

1446
01:23:02,502 --> 01:23:03,936
Sure.

1447
01:23:04,004 --> 01:23:07,338
People forget things
like that all the time.

1448
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:13,446
I could have killed that dog.

1449
01:23:13,513 --> 01:23:15,777
Mom...

1450
01:23:17,184 --> 01:23:19,846
you saved my life.

1451
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,855
Maybe.

1452
01:23:22,923 --> 01:23:24,516
No, you...

1453
01:23:24,591 --> 01:23:26,559
You did.

1454
01:23:29,596 --> 01:23:31,564
You're great, Mom.

1455
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,495
Sit down, Dad. Here.

1456
01:23:35,569 --> 01:23:38,470
I can see that you're not
too fired up about my theory...

1457
01:23:38,538 --> 01:23:39,471
but you're going
to hear it anyway.

1458
01:23:39,539 --> 01:23:40,973
I've had it
with the theories.

1459
01:23:41,041 --> 01:23:43,032
Will you just hear me
out on this, please?

1460
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:44,373
I think the blindness...

1461
01:23:44,444 --> 01:23:46,811
is an allergic reaction
to the cat...

1462
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,871
and all the tea
you've been drinking.

1463
01:23:48,949 --> 01:23:51,077
Could I have my tea, please?

1464
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:52,482
Izzy, try again.

1465
01:23:52,552 --> 01:23:53,917
Dad, go with me on this, OK?

1466
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:55,580
The first day I got here,
you were blind.

1467
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:57,249
Did you drink any
tea that morning?

1468
01:23:57,324 --> 01:23:58,689
I don't know.

1469
01:23:58,759 --> 01:24:03,253
What is this?
Give me my tea! Jesus!

1470
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:04,593
I saw Mom throw Lucy out...

1471
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:06,895
and then, minutes later,
after you talked to Gideon...

1472
01:24:06,967 --> 01:24:08,230
your sight started
coming back, remember?

1473
01:24:09,303 --> 01:24:10,862
And yesterday,
the cat was around.

1474
01:24:10,937 --> 01:24:12,166
And at first,
you were all right.

1475
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:14,435
But then you drank tea
and looked at the paper...

1476
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:15,600
And you went blind.

1477
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:17,269
Later, you went upstairs
to take a shower...

1478
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:18,937
which probably washed
some of the dander off...

1479
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:20,377
and you could see again.
I was right there.

1480
01:24:20,447 --> 01:24:21,539
Dad, think about it.

1481
01:24:21,615 --> 01:24:24,550
What's the first thing
you do in the morning?

1482
01:24:24,618 --> 01:24:25,551
You drink tea!

1483
01:24:25,619 --> 01:24:26,586
And you drank a cup
of tea last night...

1484
01:24:26,653 --> 01:24:27,916
right before
you went to bed.

1485
01:24:27,988 --> 01:24:28,921
Do you remember?

1486
01:24:28,989 --> 01:24:30,923
You said,
“I'm allergic to liquor...

1487
01:24:30,991 --> 01:24:32,356
"and I should probably
stick to tea.”

1488
01:24:32,426 --> 01:24:33,791
Then you spent
the night with the cat.

1489
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:34,793
And here you are.

1490
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:36,795
Have you lost your mind? Huh?

1491
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:40,959
Did you even have one
allergic blind attack...

1492
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:43,128
when you were sleeping
at your office--

1493
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:46,798
your office
without the cat? Huh?

1494
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:48,739
I don't know.
I don't know. Maybe not.

1495
01:24:48,809 --> 01:24:49,970
Wow.

1496
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:51,306
But if it's so simple...

1497
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:52,436
how come the doctors
missed it?

1498
01:24:52,512 --> 01:24:54,947
They missed it because
it takes both components...

1499
01:24:55,015 --> 01:24:56,039
to trigger the reaction.

1500
01:24:56,116 --> 01:24:57,948
Look, I must have read
seven thousand articles...

1501
01:24:58,018 --> 01:24:59,452
about allergies
this past year, all right?

1502
01:24:59,519 --> 01:25:00,782
I probably know more
about allergies...

1503
01:25:00,854 --> 01:25:02,754
than anyone else
in the country.

1504
01:25:02,823 --> 01:25:03,756
Allergy expert.

1505
01:25:03,824 --> 01:25:04,882
I mean,
it can be totally bizarre.

1506
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:06,084
There was a case of a guy...

1507
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:08,093
who broke out in hives
if he was around dogs...

1508
01:25:08,161 --> 01:25:09,595
but only if he ate
tuna fish first.

1509
01:25:09,663 --> 01:25:11,722
Aha! Tuna fish.
Tuna fish.

1510
01:25:11,798 --> 01:25:15,257
Dad, people can be
allergic to each other.

1511
01:25:15,335 --> 01:25:16,894
That's for sure.

1512
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:19,166
Have you tried
cutting out tea?

1513
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:22,903
Dad, what have
you got to lose?

1514
01:25:22,976 --> 01:25:26,776
Just go shower
the cat fur off.

1515
01:25:26,847 --> 01:25:28,781
Dad, we have solved it.

1516
01:25:28,849 --> 01:25:30,908
Well...

1517
01:25:30,984 --> 01:25:34,443
I guess I'm not getting
any tea, right?

1518
01:25:36,323 --> 01:25:38,758
All right.
I'll try your shower.

1519
01:25:38,825 --> 01:25:39,849
Whatever's right.

1520
01:25:48,502 --> 01:25:50,470
You know,
Percival's not dead.

1521
01:25:52,506 --> 01:25:54,474
I know he's not.

1522
01:25:59,546 --> 01:26:01,378
All right.
I'll take the cat.

1523
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:03,382
You two vacuum
everything off...

1524
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:04,918
and let's see
what happens.

1525
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:43,422
It looks like
it's supposed to.

1526
01:26:55,001 --> 01:26:57,265
Oh, I tripped on, um...

1527
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:59,362
the Swansons' lawn.

1528
01:27:04,277 --> 01:27:06,871
They left
their hose running...

1529
01:27:06,947 --> 01:27:08,881
and on a rock...

1530
01:27:08,949 --> 01:27:12,408
and then
a great big rock, and...

1531
01:27:13,954 --> 01:27:15,422
I tripped.

1532
01:27:29,970 --> 01:27:31,938
Jesus, Izzy.

1533
01:27:54,494 --> 01:27:56,929
Izzy's an amazing kid,
you know?

1534
01:27:56,997 --> 01:27:59,625
I think he might have just
figured this whole thing out...

1535
01:27:59,699 --> 01:28:02,066
with my eyes.

1536
01:28:02,135 --> 01:28:05,867
He kept watching me,
making notes...

1537
01:28:05,939 --> 01:28:07,907
following me around.

1538
01:28:07,974 --> 01:28:10,375
I thought he was going
to drive me crazy.

1539
01:28:10,443 --> 01:28:11,501
He loves you.

1540
01:28:13,947 --> 01:28:15,881
He was determined.

1541
01:28:15,949 --> 01:28:18,384
Wouldn't give it up.

1542
01:28:18,451 --> 01:28:20,419
Singers never give up.

1543
01:28:22,455 --> 01:28:25,891
Well, that's not such
a bad thing, is it?

1544
01:28:25,959 --> 01:28:28,758
What happened to you?

1545
01:28:28,828 --> 01:28:29,886
Patrick.

1546
01:28:29,963 --> 01:28:30,930
What happened?

1547
01:28:30,997 --> 01:28:35,594
Is...is that why
we're still together?

1548
01:28:35,669 --> 01:28:38,900
After all these years and
all the fighting, is that...

1549
01:28:38,972 --> 01:28:41,100
because we can't give up?

1550
01:28:53,987 --> 01:28:55,955
I just...

1551
01:28:57,991 --> 01:29:01,393
I just don't think
I can live without you.

1552
01:29:10,437 --> 01:29:12,405
Patrick, I...

1553
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:20,906
I won't be able
to stand it if he's dead.

1554
01:30:07,994 --> 01:30:10,429
What is all this stuff?

1555
01:30:10,497 --> 01:30:12,465
This stuff.

1556
01:30:18,004 --> 01:30:20,939
I like you when
you're naked, you know.

1557
01:30:21,007 --> 01:30:21,940
Why?

1558
01:30:22,008 --> 01:30:23,442
Do you know that?

1559
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:27,447
Because you look more naked
than other women somehow.

1560
01:30:27,514 --> 01:30:28,982
You know?

1561
01:30:59,145 --> 01:31:02,945
Hey, all you Singers back home.

1562
01:31:03,016 --> 01:31:04,484
This is me and my buddies...

1563
01:31:04,551 --> 01:31:07,316
bringing you greetings
from the Sinai.

1564
01:31:07,387 --> 01:31:10,652
This is Kevin
from Rocky River, Ohio.

1565
01:31:10,724 --> 01:31:13,216
And this is Tommy
from Folsom, California.

1566
01:31:13,293 --> 01:31:15,591
You know, where the prison is.
Don't worry, guys.

1567
01:31:15,662 --> 01:31:17,528
He's never been in it
or anything...

1568
01:31:17,597 --> 01:31:19,531
but he's given me this t-shirt.

1569
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:22,034
It says "Folsom Prison"
right across the front...

1570
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:23,866
with a number on it.

1571
01:31:23,937 --> 01:31:26,463
Cool, huh, Simon?
I'm saving it for you, dude.

1572
01:31:26,539 --> 01:31:28,667
We'd like to give you
a panorama view...

1573
01:31:28,742 --> 01:31:31,268
of my home away from home...

1574
01:31:31,344 --> 01:31:34,041
the lovely countryside
in this resort community.

1575
01:31:34,114 --> 01:31:35,479
Yes, that's right, folks.

1576
01:31:35,548 --> 01:31:40,884
Sand, sand, and more sand
as far as the eye can see.

1577
01:31:43,957 --> 01:31:46,949
We even have palm trees
in the desert, right?

1578
01:31:47,026 --> 01:31:48,960
No. Just sand and heat.

1579
01:31:49,028 --> 01:31:51,725
And it gets over a hundred
practically every day.

1580
01:31:51,798 --> 01:31:54,267
Actually,
it's pretty boring here.

1581
01:31:54,334 --> 01:31:57,269
Hi, Mom. I miss you.
Hey, Dad.

1582
01:31:57,337 --> 01:31:58,634
Hi, Beth.

1583
01:31:58,705 --> 01:32:00,173
Any word yet?

1584
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:01,469
No. We'll let you know.

1585
01:32:01,541 --> 01:32:03,873
Don't worry. They're
treating me pretty well here.

1586
01:32:03,943 --> 01:32:05,240
There's not a whole lot to do.

1587
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:08,906
So it's given me
some time to think.

1588
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:12,145
Sort some of the things out
about my life and stuff.

1589
01:32:32,005 --> 01:32:33,996
Mom, Dad, the phone!

1590
01:32:34,073 --> 01:32:35,472
Hurry up!

1591
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,545
Yes, this is she.

1592
01:32:56,596 --> 01:32:57,995
Percival?

1593
01:32:59,599 --> 01:33:01,966
Percy!

1594
01:33:02,035 --> 01:33:03,799
Is he all right?
Mom, is he all right?

1595
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:06,532
Oh, Percy!

1596
01:33:06,606 --> 01:33:09,439
Percival! It's Percy!

1597
01:33:09,509 --> 01:33:13,036
Where was he?
Trapped in that building?

1598
01:33:17,217 --> 01:33:19,811
...Sylvester Stallones
and "Lethal Weapons."

1599
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:21,149
I think they're trying
to tell us something--

1600
01:33:21,221 --> 01:33:24,213
trying to make us
into heroes or something.

1601
01:33:24,290 --> 01:33:26,850
Hey, Mom, what they don't know
is I'm already a hero.

1602
01:33:26,926 --> 01:33:30,453
I grew up in the Singer family
and lived to tell about it.

1603
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:16,668
If you want to be brave

1604
01:34:20,213 --> 01:34:23,649
Reach for the top of the sky

1605
01:34:24,884 --> 01:34:27,046
And the farthest point

1606
01:34:28,521 --> 01:34:32,719
On the horizon

1607
01:34:35,528 --> 01:34:38,498
Do you know
who you'll meet there?

1608
01:34:40,233 --> 01:34:45,535
Great soldiers and seafarers,
artists and dreamers

1609
01:34:45,605 --> 01:34:48,438
Who need to be close

1610
01:34:49,909 --> 01:34:52,105
Close to the light

1611
01:34:56,215 --> 01:34:58,843
They need to be

1612
01:34:58,918 --> 01:35:03,151
In danger of burning by fire

1613
01:35:07,293 --> 01:35:11,821
And I

1614
01:35:11,898 --> 01:35:13,957
I want to get there

1615
01:35:21,808 --> 01:35:25,039
I want to be one

1616
01:35:26,245 --> 01:35:29,840
One who is touched by the sun

1617
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:35,287
One who is touched by the sun

1618
01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:41,584
One who is touched by the sun

1619
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:55,064
Often I want to walk

1620
01:35:58,378 --> 01:36:01,245
The safe side of the street

1621
01:36:02,548 --> 01:36:06,746
And lull myself to sleep

1622
01:36:06,819 --> 01:36:10,619
End all my pain

1623
01:36:12,291 --> 01:36:14,089
Oh

1624
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:17,391
Deep down inside I know

1625
01:36:17,463 --> 01:36:18,692
I've got to

1626
01:36:18,765 --> 01:36:20,824
Learn from the greats

1627
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,562
Earn my right to be living

1628
01:36:23,636 --> 01:36:27,834
Let my wings of desire

1629
01:36:27,907 --> 01:36:30,399
Soar over the night

1630
01:36:34,614 --> 01:36:38,983
I need to let them say

1631
01:36:39,052 --> 01:36:41,316
She must have been mad

1632
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:50,427
And I

1633
01:36:50,496 --> 01:36:53,329
I want to get there

1634
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:03,410
I want to be one

1635
01:37:04,677 --> 01:37:08,113
One who is touched by the sun

1636
01:37:10,016 --> 01:37:13,850
One who is touched by the sun

1637
01:37:15,421 --> 01:37:19,289
One who is touched by the sun

1638
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:25,158
One who is touched by the sun

1639
01:37:26,499 --> 01:37:31,733
One who is touched by the sun

1640
01:37:31,804 --> 01:37:36,674
One who is touched by the sun
