1
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,798
I've wasted a lot of my time
looking for you

2
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:27,959
It's strange, how you're the one
who comes to me

3
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,875
So, you're ready to tell me
all that happened, right?

4
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,399
If the same
thing happened to you...

5
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:05,153
You might not ever
want to see anyone again.

6
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,350
Are we almost there yet?

7
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,040
This stuff is heavy and you
won't let us use the elevator

8
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,519
What's the big deal anyway?

9
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,232
Will you just stop complaining!

10
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,112
It's damn annoying!

11
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,553
Damn it!

12
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,875
We were doing fine playing
in Bangkok

13
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,235
But no, we had to change the
scenery

14
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,120
Who's idea anyway?

15
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,554
Mine

16
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,717
I found a better paying place
for you

17
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,035
What else do you want?

18
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,150
In Bangkok better musicians
will just eat us alive.

19
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,950
Isn't this place here close to
where you live?

20
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,479
Why don't you go sleep
at your place

21
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,750
so we have more space here.

22
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,916
That's none
of your damn business.

23
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,234
Come on guys

24
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,754
We'll play cards and in a couple
of hours it'll be morning.

25
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,871
Hey!

26
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,520
What's the matter with you?

27
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,993
Go to the bathroom
if you need to take a piss.

28
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,716
Totally insane!

29
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,077
Hey, What's that you're
staring at?

30
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,469
See that piece of cloth?

31
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,591
Did you see it when we came in?

32
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,953
I don't know

33
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,469
Didn't notice it...

34
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:51,159
But I didn't

35
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
You bastard!

36
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,754
Always trying to scare me.

37
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,477
Hey! I didn't see it either

38
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,838
This is the first I've seen it.

39
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,236
Hey! What the hell!

40
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,679
Hey! What the hell is wrong
with all of you

41
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,040
Just this and you all look as white as
boiled chicken.

42
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,634
You asshole!

43
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,278
This is your idea of a joke?

44
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,160
Don't you dare!

45
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,917
Don't!

46
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,191
I'm serious!

47
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,715
Boy! How are you?

48
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,114
What are you holding me
down for?

49
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,272
If you don't quit it,
I'll get serious.

50
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,435
Where the hell did Kob go?

51
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,475
Don't know
what's wrong with him

52
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,751
Just left one after the other.

53
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,440
Why is it so hot in here?

54
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,796
Who the hell turned off
the air conditioner?

55
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,390
Noone did

56
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,509
Uan, what's wrong?

57
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,599
Oh, it's nothing

58
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,595
Who took this down?

59
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,639
If we don't put it back,
we won't hear the end of it

60
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,596
Hyai, put it back.

61
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,194
Why me?

62
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,391
Just do it.

63
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,199
Can't a friend ask you
to do something

64
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,515
Hey! If you can't do it then don't.

65
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,153
I'll do it myself

66
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,353
What the hell is wrong with you!

67
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,310
Hyai, where are you going?

68
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,194
Hey! Hyai!

69
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,915
Damn you!

70
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,713
Now, I have to do it

71
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,998
Uan, What's wrong?

72
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,995
Hello?

73
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,599
Pim, don't do anything

74
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,120
Just quickly come downstairs.

75
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,677
Wait

76
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,516
Hello

77
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,676
Hello

78
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,235
Nui, let's go

79
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,156
Nui... Wake up

80
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,199
Nui...

81
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,270
Nui, let's get out of here...

82
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,311
Nui

83
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,994
You all saw it, right?

84
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,951
Boy!

85
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,120
Boy!

86
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,475
You're going to be Okay

87
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,160
Boy!

88
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,152
Help!

89
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,958
Boy!

90
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,072
Boy!

91
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:40,996
I think it was more of an accident...

92
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,992
What do you think?

93
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:58,232
Hey, what are you so afraid of?

94
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,271
That woman

95
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,039
Pim, Have you called his home?

96
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,199
Pim...

97
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,838
Pim

98
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,120
Did you call?

99
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:47,229
I called but noone answered.

100
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,952
I want to go home

101
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,917
And what about Boy?

102
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,669
You're going to just leave him?

103
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,068
He's dead!

104
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,512
But he's your friend, man

105
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,717
But I'm going home

106
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,120
I thought you said
you didn't want to go home

107
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,078
Didn't you say that your home
was worse than prison

108
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,510
So, how come now
you want to go home?

109
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,160
I don't know

110
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,119
But right now I want to go home

111
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,633
I also want to go home

112
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,120
My name's Tawan,
I've been here for so long

113
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,190
I can't find my way back home

114
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,989
Take me back home with you.

115
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,030
What the hell?

116
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,435
We don't live at the same house.

117
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,752
That's alright
I want to stay with you.

118
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,469
Crazy!

119
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:14,157
It's Okay, I'll have
someone else take me home.

120
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,474
Wait. Well, where do you live?

121
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,192
Here, this is my home.

122
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,239
Here, let me see.

123
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,754
Is it the same?

124
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,479
Who's the woman in the picture?

125
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,275
Oh! That's my sister Saeng Daow

126
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,237
She works in the hotel

127
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,509
Don't know what she does

128
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,077
She goes upstairs
with men for hours.

129
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:10,435
It took days before they found
her body hidden under the bed

130
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,719
but without her head.

131
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:25,154
Did they catch the person
that murdered her?

132
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,308
Hey Wait, forget about that now

133
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,956
So, where's her head?

134
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:47,314
He cut off her head and tied her hair
to the air condition vent.

135
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,990
And how did they find her head?

136
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,997
You dumbass

137
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,874
So smart on everything else

138
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,192
They found it
the same way you did.

139
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,160
Get away!

140
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,152
Don't come near me!

141
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,391
Get the fuck away from me!

142
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,756
I said don't come near me!

143
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,271
Stay away from me!

144
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,310
Put the gun down

145
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,668
Put the gun down

146
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,516
Put the gun down

147
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,032
Kob

148
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,197
Kob don't!

149
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,238
Stop shooting!

150
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,749
Kob put the gun down first

151
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,995
Kob!

152
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,439
Kob!

153
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,238
Kob!

154
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,713
Kob!

155
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,274
What the fuck is wrong
with you!

156
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:10,519
Don't you leave me!

157
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,755
Let me go!

158
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,199
Let me go!

159
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,030
I don't want to die!

160
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,195
I want to go home!

161
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,120
Go home!

162
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:25,676
Let go!

163
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,990
Kob!

164
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,030
Kob!

165
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,752
Hurry!

166
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,189
Kob!

167
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:32,234
Did all of you normally do drugs?

168
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,160
No

169
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,037
Really?

170
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,116
But from what
you're telling me now

171
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:46,075
it's completely opposite to the
police report

172
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:55,479
The hallucinations
could've come from this.

173
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:05,757
The police found it in your friend's
pants after you all took off.

174
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,669
Anything?

175
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,156
Noone knows of anybody
by the name Tawan

176
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,472
Noone by that name was ever
on the patient list either

177
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,792
And what about the dead body
that was found in the hotel?

178
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,794
Everyone claims that they've
never heard of this

179
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,754
and of the headless body ever
entering this hospital at all.

180
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,079
We're talking about a dead
person here, not a patient

181
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,079
Noone here knows.

182
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,519
Damn it!

183
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:50,077
Who the hell
do you want us to ask?

184
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,951
I don't know
what her name was

185
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,520
She had no relatives or friends

186
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,752
So, we just cremated her

187
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,637
even though they haven't
found her head.

188
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:37,717
Did the hotel claim
any responsibility for this?

189
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,071
Noone wanted to talk about it

190
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:45,676
After the cremation,
everyone just went silent

191
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,396
They didn't even
bring back her head

192
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:58,120
So, it's become a curse
that anyone who sees her.

193
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:02,398
Will either die without reason

194
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,160
or go completely insane
like Saem.

195
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,711
So, there was someone
who saw her like we did?

196
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,120
Saem

197
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,159
Saem, come out here

198
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,750
Saem was the one
who took her head

199
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,031
out from the air condition vent

200
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,712
From then on, he has seen her
face everynight while asleep

201
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:50,472
He didn't dare fall asleep

202
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:55,071
until I took the curse off him.

203
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,990
How's that?

204
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,873
He had to sleep in the coffin with
a person who died a violent death

205
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,397
every night before midnight
for 7 days

206
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,434
with my help
will release the curse.

207
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,072
Does this mean that all 4
of us must do the same?

208
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,553
And what about the lady
behind you?

209
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,672
Won't she also join you?

210
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,830
Behind us?

211
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,633
Who?

212
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,919
There's only the 4 of us

213
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,352
Hey! Aren't you like blind?

214
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:57,434
No wonder Saem didn't want
to greet you

215
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:04,232
It's because she also came
with you...

216
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:41,353
You see, I've never heard of
anything like this before

217
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:50,633
But if there really has been
a murder committed

218
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,517
and even
the Buddhist priest knows

219
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,996
about it then so does the police

220
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,917
Manoon, I want all the details
on the prostitution

221
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:08,909
murder case immediately.

222
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,835
On that day

223
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:51,110
the Buddhist told me to stay
inside the temple church

224
00:48:51,240 --> 00:49:02,071
while the rest set out finding
those dead coffins

225
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,709
before their time runs out.

226
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,870
What happens when it becomes
after midnight?

227
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:52,158
Hyai, What the hell
are you looking at?

228
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,153
Did you notice

229
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,949
All the cars are blinking their
head lights at us.

230
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:08,996
I blink in return but then they
honk their horn at me.

231
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,234
There! There's another one.

232
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,875
Damn it!

233
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,836
What is it with these damn
dead coffins?

234
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,229
So damn hard to find

235
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,434
Are we going to survive this?

236
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,910
Shut your fucking mouth!
Damn!

237
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,879
That's it

238
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,711
Can I not go?

239
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,479
I want to go home

240
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:19,120
Just drop me off at home,
alright pal?

241
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:23,716
Damn!
What the hell is your problem?

242
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,120
Pleasel'm asking you

243
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,033
Here, turn here
My house is just here.

244
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,916
Aren't you afraid to die anymore?

245
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,960
I'll be safer at home

246
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,833
The most I'll get is a good beating

247
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,833
At least my father won't kill me

248
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,036
Turn hereTurn here

249
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,436
Stop. Stop right here.

250
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,555
You don't believe in this
curse, right?

251
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,035
If I do, then what?

252
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,470
I'll have to sleep inside a coffin
like that crazy guy?

253
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,477
Right, you guys go ahead

254
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:20,913
We'll see what happens
tomorrow See ya!

255
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,155
Hey!

256
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,874
Wait! Hyai!

257
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,873
Nui... Forget about him

258
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,157
We can look for it by ourselves.

259
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,229
Where is everyone

260
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:38,072
Ma! I'm home!

261
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,669
Hey, little one

262
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,678
Did Aunty spank you again

263
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,270
Sir, there's only 2 coffins

264
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,868
Is there maybe just one more?

265
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:19,273
You got two for one damn
bottle of whisky

266
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,960
What else do you want?

267
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:26,631
Why don't you die,
then you'll have another one

268
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,757
Hey! Don't have to be rude.

269
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,472
Calm down, man

270
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,831
It's better than nothing.

271
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,195
Gets two and complains

272
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,034
We've got to hurry back
or we won't make it on time.

273
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,557
It's already past midnight

274
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:20,309
The Buddhist priest said
the ritual won't work

275
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,120
That's not true

276
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,999
He's lying to us

277
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,475
It's hard enough finding
the coffins

278
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,070
he has to do the ritual

279
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,279
What have I done wrong?

280
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,837
Why do I have to wait for death?

281
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,993
Uan, when it's time

282
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,669
we all must die

283
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,959
There has to be another way

284
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:23,392
Another way?

285
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,072
What other way?

286
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,997
Anyway I'm going to die

287
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:32,240
Even the Buddhist priest
can't help me.

288
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,273
That ghost will break my neck

289
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:44,033
You too, she don't let you servive.

290
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:51,120
We get the curse,
all we get the curse.

291
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:51,996
Finally, all of us can not servive.

292
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,156
Uan, that's enough

293
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,149
Where's Hyai?

294
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,599
We can't leave him alone.

295
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:43,113
What's wrong Nui

296
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:54,033
Hurry up.

297
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,511
Hyai!

298
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,074
Hyai!

299
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,952
No more!

300
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:31,996
No more!

301
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,030
Let me go!

302
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,479
Help!

303
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,956
Help me!

304
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:17,278
Don't come near me!

305
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,030
Wake up

306
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,674
Wake up

307
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,720
Is this the wrong house?

308
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:14,719
No, I remember the mailbox.

309
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,990
Alright, then let's go in.

310
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:21,272
Hey! I'm not going in

311
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:25,160
I'll wait in the car

312
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,957
It might get stolen.

313
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,877
How the hell is it going to
get stolen

314
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,552
We'll be right out

315
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,079
We'll just drag Hyai out to
sleep at the temple...

316
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,919
It's safer.

317
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:39,237
I still want to wait here.

318
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,873
That's okay Nui

319
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,996
Let him wait.

320
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:49,951
I can guess that it was suicide

321
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:54,352
Your friend had problems
at home.

322
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:06,236
Before we left his house

323
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:13,233
his parents came back

324
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:20,120
We didn't know
how to explain it to them

325
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:25,069
They wouldn't listen

326
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:32,117
They just kept blaming us

327
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:45,150
And where did you go
all that night?

328
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:55,230
That night we decided
to go back to the temple

329
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,634
But Uan

330
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:14,879
Uan had this stupid idea.

331
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,716
This is the safest place.

332
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,071
Aren't you going to keep it
for the ritual.

333
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,951
Let's just get past tonight

334
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:39,117
lt'll be kind of like being reborn

335
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,316
Don't think of me in a bad way

336
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,079
I'm asking you

337
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:52,999
Nui

338
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,160
What?

339
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:58,392
Close the coffin for me.

340
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,152
Okay.

341
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,117
Uan, wake up.

342
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,070
Uan.

343
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,156
Uan.

344
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,309
Uan.

345
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,037
The reason for his death.

346
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:40,470
We believe it to be caused by
lack of oxygen

347
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,989
But what do you expect from
someone stupid enough

348
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:47,511
to sleep in a coffin with
the lid closed

349
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:53,638
But actually he didn't close
it all the way

350
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,874
He left an opening
for air to breathe.

351
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,749
There's only the two of us left.

352
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:06,078
Pim, would you like to meet
Saeng Daow?

353
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:13,238
How? This is not a living
human being.

354
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:20,034
Are we just going to wait for her
to come to us?

355
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:25,874
But where can we find her?

356
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:32,231
We'll start from the place
where she was murdered.

357
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:08,514
He cut off her head and tied her
hair to the air condition vent.

358
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:29,314
Did you see anything strange?

359
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,478
No, none at all.

360
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:43,237
Here, that's all that is left

361
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:55,870
Oh, there is one thing that
you should know

362
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:19,598
Saeng Daow was pregnant
when she died.

363
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,995
The letter that the hotel
employee gave us

364
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,953
was written by Saeng Daow

365
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,514
but was never sent

366
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,271
We decided to go to the address

367
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,755
that was on the front of
the envelope

368
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:52,078
and deliver that letter

369
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:58,391
hoping that it might
release her from this pain

370
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:03,873
and suffering she is in.

371
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,714
Who let you in?

372
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,315
I'm sorry

373
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:04,429
Excuse me Ma'am

374
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:09,352
Ma'amThe name on this letter
is addressed to you, right?

375
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:23,232
It's a letter from Saeng Daow.

376
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,873
Saeng Daow

377
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,430
Saeng Daow my child

378
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:38,838
Saeng Daow ran away
from home a long time ago

379
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:41,878
I never received any news
from her

380
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:46,120
I didn't know where to find her

381
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:50,193
Her father died
when she was just a child

382
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:58,710
I raised her with the money
from my new husband.

383
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:12,991
Who's the girl standing
next to Saeng Daow?

384
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,997
Oh, that's Tawan

385
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:18,120
My other daughter

386
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,160
Saeng Daow loved her sister
very much

387
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:26,075
They went everywhere together,
never were separated

388
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:34,517
Tawan was close to her sister,
she cried wanting to go too

389
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:43,238
Saeng Daow just ran away
and didn't tell anyone

390
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:48,354
She left her sister even though
they've never been apart

391
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:56,160
Tawan must've been really lonely.

392
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:01,638
And what happened to Tawan?

393
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:06,874
Tawan would just keep herself
in the room

394
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:19,031
Everytime I saw her
she would be sleeping here

395
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:24,951
I never thought that one day
she wouldn't wake up

396
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:40,508
Who's in the next room?

397
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:43,108
That's just my husband

398
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,189
He's probably hungry

399
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:48,034
Go on

400
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,071
It's getting dark, I think the
both of you should be going

401
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:54,073
It's dangerous driving back
at night

402
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:59,432
Go on now

403
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:06,635
Go on

404
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:09,120
It's nothing

405
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,792
Go, go, go, go

406
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:15,038
And don't come back

407
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:45,915
I'm sorry Saeng Daow.

408
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:38,554
So, we still don't know
anything, right?

409
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:47,273
Why is Saeng Daow
so angry at us?

410
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:51,757
It might not have anything
to do with us at all

411
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:54,348
She probably just doesn't like us.

412
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:59,230
And wants to kill us
because she's crazy

413
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,315
So, what now?

414
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,476
You want to go back and sleep
in the coffin?

415
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,477
So, I can die the same way Uan did?

416
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,670
No, thanks

417
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,234
We'll just let the Buddhist do
the ritual for us first

418
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,511
It might work.

419
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:30,032
Don't you want to know more
about Saeng Daow?

420
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:35,029
The more we know
the faster we die

421
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:41,430
Oh... Did you see anything
over at her house?

422
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:49,077
Like what?

423
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,154
Like under the bed?

424
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,991
Sa... SaSa

425
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:36,031
Saeng Daow

426
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:55,951
You've wasted a lot of time already

427
01:27:56,080 --> 01:28:01,438
Will you please tell me something
I can put in my report?

428
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,592
Like in the accident

429
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:08,229
Did anything peculiar happen?

430
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:18,637
I really can't remember much of it

431
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:31,153
Everything seems to be a blur.

432
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,036
Pim...

433
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,160
Pim...

434
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,628
Where are you?

435
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:56,632
Pim...

436
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,718
Pim...

437
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:06,116
Pim...

438
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:14,708
Pim...

439
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:16,034
Where are you?

440
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:17,479
Pim...

441
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,909
Pim...

442
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:22,990
Pim...

443
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:26,510
Where are you?

444
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:35,548
Pim...

445
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:37,398
Where are you?

446
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:39,120
Pim...

447
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,873
Come out of there...

448
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:42,631
Pim...

449
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,518
Come out of there...

450
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:47,995
Pim...

451
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,314
It's dangerous...

452
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:52,318
Come out of there, Pim.

453
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,548
Pim...

454
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:03,235
Pim...

455
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,716
Pim...

456
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:29,070
I don't know
what else to ask you

457
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:34,832
All your responses just end up
back on the same story

458
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:38,708
It's because of a ghost

459
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:46,589
Alright then,
what about your friend?

460
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:49,990
Where is he?

461
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:57,120
We had a difference of opinions...

462
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:58,473
He thought that the Buddhist
priest would be able to release him

463
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:02,878
from the curse by performing
the ritual

464
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:11,311
So, he went back to the temple to
try the ritual one more time.

465
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:14,911
What about you?

466
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:19,033
Don't you think of doing
the same?

467
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:29,430
If I did I probably wouldn't be
here now telling you about it.

468
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:37,518
Because from then on,
Nui just disappeared.

469
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:45,789
To this day, I still can't find him.

470
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:56,756
Your story is quite unbelievable

471
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:02,679
It's creepier than any book
I've read

472
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:12,950
But your characters seem to
have the same names as mine

473
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:19,477
I'll tell you what

474
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:23,077
I'll tell you a story of my own

475
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:28,832
I had a suspect here once,
waiting for interrogation

476
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:32,151
He was a psycho

477
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:39,396
We believed he killed people
as a sacrificial offering

478
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,471
What ever that is

479
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,120
Later that night,
he tore his clothes off

480
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:46,271
and hung himself on the jail bars

481
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:58,358
There was a writing
on the wall written in blood

482
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:05,190
He might be the murderer
in your story

483
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:13,276
So, do you still see Saeng Daow?

484
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:21,076
Is she here now?

485
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:30,399
Anyway, you're probably tired

486
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:33,074
You can go

487
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:39,994
but I'll still need you to come back

488
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:43,157
and make your statement
one more time

489
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:49,112
I hope you'll cooperate.

490
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:21,591
If the same thing happened to you

491
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:32,237
You might not ever want
to see anyone again.

492
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:42,918
With all do love and respect to
my dearest mother.

493
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:46,715
I'm so sorry that I ran away
without telling anyone.

494
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:50,515
I know it must've caused
you much pain and sorrow.

495
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:55,873
But did you know that this
daughter also felt the same pain

496
01:35:55,960 --> 01:36:00,078
and sorrow as you did?

497
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:07,072
All I could do was cry
for what I've done to you.

498
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:09,674
I'm such a bad person

499
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:13,713
for leaving you and my sister
isn't that right mother?

500
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,717
But please believe me mother.

501
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:21,198
I have my reasons in making
this decision.

502
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:24,158
If I had to stay
in that house any longer

503
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:25,992
my life would surely be filled
with such heartache

504
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:29,874
and would finally end
without meaning.

505
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:34,158
Please don't ask me
to go back to that house

506
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:38,950
because I don't think
I have the courage to face you

507
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:42,120
or anyone ever again.

508
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:49,037
My sins can never be erased
for as long as I live

509
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:55,918
and I will never forget the people
that have done me wrong...

510
01:36:56,040 --> 01:37:04,948
especially those men which
to this day I curse them all.

511
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,957
In conclusion

512
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:10,868
I ask you to please explain to
Tawan so that she understands

513
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,918
because I really worry about her.

514
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:16,474
She is still so young

515
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:20,036
and probably very disappointed
in me for what I've done.

516
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:23,038
With Love, Saeng Daow
