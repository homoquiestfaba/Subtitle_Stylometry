1
00:00:55,498 --> 00:00:58,379
A few years ago

2
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,624
Antarctica

3
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,609
inhospitable wasteland

4
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:10,524
But even here,
at the bottom of the frozen earth,

5
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:13,039
find life.

6
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:21,801
And not any life

7
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,269
penguins

8
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:31,313
joyous, breathtaking, fluctuating
charming and affectionate life.

9
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:36,390
Look at them, tumbling to
his chubby ass

10
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,024
Who could take these
santiacich small snow clowns

11
00:01:40,144 --> 00:01:41,323
serious!

12
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:43,715
Does anyone where are we going?

13
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:45,809
Who cares?
I'm not asking for anything.

14
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:46,995
Neither do I!
Neither do I!

15
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:47,939
We're cool!

16
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:51,014
Thus philandering advance series
and see for yourself!

17
00:01:51,134 --> 00:01:54,103
Kovalsky, Riko,
the onset of the aerial survey!

18
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,232
Captain, it seems, we bezletovi.

19
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:02,839
Well fine, which
then we have wings?

20
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:09,654
I like it!
This could be our thing!

21
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:14,628
What do you think?
Call it high applause!

22
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:19,269
Hey, did you see that? It is an egg!
It will not take someone?

23
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:21,912
We can not.
Why not?

24
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:25,629
Outside is a dangerous world.
And we just penguins.

25
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:28,089
You know, we are nothing,
a charming and affectionate.

26
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:31,818
Amen, why do you think us
documentarians still filming?

27
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:38,051
I'm sorry, baby. A few eggs
we lose every year. Such is the nature.

28
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:41,990
Oh well, nature.
I guess it makes sense, but

29
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:48,271
Daco deep in my belly
tells me that it does not make sense.

30
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:51,952
You know what?
I refuse to nature!

31
00:02:53,813 --> 00:02:55,274
Who is with me?

32
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:41,904
Old ship! Nobody
stade yet returned alive!

33
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:46,978
Calm down, Kovalsky down there
is a bird. Look, he's fine.

34
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,582
Leopard seals! Natural snakes.
There are snakes natural snakes?

35
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:58,341
How do I know? Living
in a strange frozen tundra!

36
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:01,980
They're coming after the egg!
Run me down immediately!

37
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,765
It would be enough for us
collect30 feet seaweed...

38
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:09,873
Small and helpless Penguin
are frozen with fear.

39
00:04:09,993 --> 00:04:14,471
They know that if they fall
of this cliff, surely die.

40
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:16,718
Gunter, push them.

41
00:04:17,726 --> 00:04:22,387
Training jellyfish we've learned
listen to simple voice commands.

42
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,524
That's how it went!

43
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:39,876
Go ahead, Riko.
Do not let them get it!

44
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:44,788
Okay.
That would go.

45
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:50,394
Gets higher!

46
00:04:56,313 --> 00:04:57,523
Success.

47
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:03,682
I recommend it now detonate.
No detain them.

48
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:07,279
It is time to detonate.
Not until we see the whites of their eyes.

49
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,006
They usually pupil, very
little white. Almost none.

50
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:12,643
They have very little white, though?
None at all.

51
00:05:12,763 --> 00:05:14,995
And what if the eyes look
far left?

52
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,442
Shoot in the hole!

53
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,796
Kowalski, analysis?

54
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:39,987
In this we really amazing!

55
00:05:41,163 --> 00:05:44,140
Guys, we did it!
Mission accomplished.

56
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,973
We can do our high applause!

57
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,870
Yes.

58
00:05:55,303 --> 00:05:56,353
My mistake.

59
00:05:57,853 --> 00:06:00,846
Look, it is miracle of birth.

60
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:06,315
Moment of extraordinary beauty.

61
00:06:08,216 --> 00:06:11,974
It's disgusting. I guess
the slime everywhere mouth.

62
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:22,185
Ahojte.
You are my family?

63
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:36,333
You have family all
soon dies. I'm sorry.

64
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:37,666
What?

65
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:42,206
Why would he not know?
Nobody is not going to die!

66
00:06:42,326 --> 00:06:46,862
No, baby. Do you have a family,
you got us. We have each other.

67
00:06:47,438 --> 00:06:50,494
If this is not the family,
then I do not know what is.

68
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:56,257
Such cute.

69
00:06:56,377 --> 00:07:00,720
Kowalski, what is our path?
- 95% certainly perish.

70
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,685
And the other5%?

71
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:06,494
The famous design, as before
saw no penguin!

72
00:07:06,614 --> 00:07:09,826
Then take action!
Where are we going?

73
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:12,962
Future boys glorious future.

74
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:21,509
<i>Glorious Future</i>

75
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:25,687
And a song.
That can not stand the heat.

76
00:07:25,807 --> 00:07:27,618
Singing grow, Captain!

77
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,898
So hurry up!

78
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:38,237
Kovalsky, hand reporting!
I'm really tired of this song!

79
00:07:39,518 --> 00:07:42,203
The best thing ownership circus

80
00:07:42,323 --> 00:07:45,947
is that you can transfer
gun across state lines!

81
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:53,761
The Penguins of Madagascar

82
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:01,432
On this day10 years ago.

83
00:08:01,552 --> 00:08:03,105
Hatched eggs are small

85
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:10,123

Royal Flush.

90
00:08:23,497 --> 00:08:26,673
Pesak what we rule

91
00:08:26,793 --> 00:08:30,075
Sorry, go ahead.
I've lost it. Pawn go wrong.

92
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:32,759
Sir, we are approaching
to our goal.

93
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:37,784
Hey Captain, I really do not...
Do you doubt me, pawn?

94
00:08:37,904 --> 00:08:39,969
No, sir!
What a pity!

95
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:42,742
Because it respects
brave soldiers.

96
00:08:42,862 --> 00:08:45,031
Really? Then I

97
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:47,932

But come on, nesrandujes?

108

<i>Everybody come in, do you hear?
And give yourself an iced tea.</i>

110
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:54,810
Pawn, if you have something for the

Well Captain, I'd like to significant

Well, okay, got
We have something else.

113
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:07,143
Vending machine?
It's not common, pawn.

114
00:10:07,263 --> 00:10:11,475
The last place
in the US states of juicy,

115
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:16,118
but not chemically hazardous
crunchy bits of heaven called

116

Cheese puffs!

117

Happy birthday jingling,

Thank you!

119
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:36,087
Do not waste time, pawn!
Turn on the machine and take your gift!

120
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:41,507
We just broke
in the safest object

121
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:44,033
in North America.
You know what that means?

122
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:46,833
We are criminals,
who get a life?

123
00:10:46,953 --> 00:10:49,493
Always feeling the hot breath
Johnny Law on the neck?

124
00:10:49,613 --> 00:10:54,089
No, we are an elite unit,
elite elite!

125
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:57,938
The top shelf in the office.
The penultimate syllable. Plus first

126
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:02,382
Where did pawn?

127
00:11:02,765 --> 00:11:04,482
There she is. D3,

128
00:11:04,602 --> 00:11:08,391
Oh pawn. How much is it?
$3,50, sir.

129
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:11,203
That's uncalled for.
Even for a pawn.

130
00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:14,125
Vending machine is alive!

131
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,476
I do not think I like
your behavior, automat,

132
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:20,810
nor your prices.
Let them!

133
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:27,109
What?

135
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,627
Kovalsky, analysis!

136
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:25,691
All the evidence suggests

137
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:29,736
I ate too cheese crisps.

138
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,426
We're behind enemy lines
and incredibly thirsty.

139
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:36,173
Riko, get us out
this tasty prison.

140
00:12:39,271 --> 00:12:41,067
Nice work Riko.

141
00:12:41,187 --> 00:12:43,937
You're significant and valuable
member of this team.

142
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:02,705
Pawn, stop aloud
and still vomit.

143
00:13:03,112 --> 00:13:03,949
Sorry.

144
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:08,525
There's a dark and menacing. My two
least favorite room features.

00:13:08,645 --> 00:13:10,084
Oh look, a button!

146
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:11,781
Pawn, no!

147
00:13:14,463 --> 00:13:17,149
What did I tell you about...
Excuse me, what?

148
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:28,262
It looks like a giant laser
sent to kill us all, sir.

149
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:34,246
U, another button!

150
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,710
What?

151
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,261
Baci bac!

152

Nice birds include

153
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:02,350
Well it hurt.

154
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:06,185
And I was so happy,
you see that again.

155
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:12,889
Captain, Kovalsky, Riko
a sweet little pawn

156
00:14:14,242 --> 00:14:15,936
Who are you?

157
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:19,345
People know me

166
00:14:54,953 --> 00:14:56,982
Dave.

167
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:13,164
Sorry. Moment,
I go this way.

168
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:20,913
Keep talking, keep going.
You do not remember me?

169
00:15:22,604 --> 00:15:26,199

You do not remember me, but
I will never forget you.

175
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:45,934
Central Park Zoo.

176
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:48,189
Life was good.

177
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:54,284
Large tank, a great place
view of the houses monkeys,

178
00:15:55,117 --> 00:15:59,658
And, of course,
my adoring fanbase

179
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:03,934
Dave, octopus
with its1,000 tricks.

180
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:08,745
Amazing!
Everything belonged to me.

181
00:16:09,265 --> 00:16:13,043
<i>Hey baby, you gotta see this!
Come up here, quick!</i>

182
00:16:13,163 --> 00:16:15,235
And then Everything has changed.

183
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:20,908
Mommy, Mommy, I want one!
Just smile and wave, boys!

184
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:23,962
And you took my everything.

185
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:28,638
There are some amazing!
Have you seen anything nicer?

186
00:16:28,758 --> 00:16:31,456
Because admired Penguin

187
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:35,367
no longer be interested in
old octopus.

188
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:38,306
Going away Dave.

189
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:42,050
And so it went still further

190
00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:44,582
at the zoo in the aquarium.

191
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:46,329
I do not see penguins, buddy.

192
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:49,182
Admired penguins stole the show.

193
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:56,635
While I was circumvented

194
00:16:58,155 --> 00:16:59,469

197
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:17,529
It sounds horrible.
That's what it was.

198
00:17:17,814 --> 00:17:22,449
I realized that some creatures
is born and you get all the love

199
00:17:22,845 --> 00:17:25,227
and other get nothing!

200
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:28,589
The only thing I
drove through the years

201
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:32,547
is my oyster hungry for revenge!

202
00:17:34,163 --> 00:17:37,333
And my rare collection
snow globe.

203
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,741
What you mad?

204
00:17:45,086 --> 00:17:46,327
I do not know.

205
00:17:46,678 --> 00:17:50,473
Oh Derylov Dejl Dave, we can not
blame for what happened to you!

206
00:17:50,593 --> 00:17:54,780

ImTOO as t I
Finally, the power to destroy you.

210
00:18:09,747 --> 00:18:12,518
I think that I have for you
bad news, Denis.

You fight against improper birds
because we are an elite unit!

Best of the Best, semolina
porridge on the stove platinum.

And we'll take your
deadly green crap

214
00:18:22,345 --> 00:18:24,585

directly through the hatch.

215
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:27,477
But how would you like to do?

216
00:18:27,892 --> 00:18:30,217

So octopus, you want to dance
Gondola mambo? Dance!

231
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:35,908
Ouch! Freshwater pearl, it burns.

232
00:19:36,028 --> 00:19:38,708
I lost my picture.
Kowalski, either through my eyes!

233
00:19:38,828 --> 00:19:41,109

Aye, aye, Captain.

Okay, okay. Now,

Kovalsky, you remember our conversation
on good but unnecessary comments?

255
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:31,759
Yes, sir.
Sometimes it only needs okridlit!

256
00:21:34,381 --> 00:21:35,381
Phew!

257
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,470
I'm sorry
for underestimating the plan, Captain.

258
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,602
That's fine, Kovalsky only
More about me doubt it.

259
00:21:53,722 --> 00:21:56,097
So what do boards
is this happening?

260
00:22:00,157 --> 00:22:02,109
Stay calm, penguins.

Hey, go away!
Have enough hugging!

Corporal.

For example, a penguin.
Really? And you?

284
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,632
My name is withheld.
So secret? What?

285
00:23:19,752 --> 00:23:21,910

Please?
That accent.

287
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:28,713
No, my name is secret, because I was
the leader of the firing pin piece.

288
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,413
Seal is Gunny,

289
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:33,316
The bear is a corporal,
our muscleman

You see, it works
on a completely different level.

298
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,322
A Riko is our demolition expert.

299
00:24:06,577 --> 00:24:10,767
Destroys the chair just entertainment.
Total for no reason!

300
00:24:10,887 --> 00:24:13,124
And then there's pawn.

301
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,361
He is like our

Canada secretly trains

Hotdogs are just
17% of the actual dogs.

My team found that Dr. Oktavius Brine

Dave.
How Dave. Octopus.

Hit the button
with a picture of a microphone.

00:27:16,794 --> 00:27:20,889
It ended?
So why did I call you?

355
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:22,479
Strange.

356
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,746
Oh, maybe I
you had to show you this!

357
00:27:26,361 --> 00:27:29,275
This is too much serum
4 penguins.

358
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:34,980
Oh, you thought it was just
for the four of you? No no no!

359
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,357
Even just starting to.

360
00:27:38,296 --> 00:27:43,267
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go buy something.

361
00:27:43,387 --> 00:27:44,886
For revenge!

362
00:27:48,411 --> 00:27:49,828
Wait.
How to...

363
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,415
This red if?

364
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:57,087
I guess it was.
This is not it.

365
00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:02,705
Came a warning.
Coincidence image.

366
00:28:03,107 --> 00:28:05,431
Detail of Berlin.
Missing15 penguins.

367
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:09,126
Dave catches the other penguins!
Oh no, they are gentle and affectionate!

368
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,939
We must act. What?
We must act. What?

369
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:12,593
Time for our game 'A'!
All together!

370
00:28:12,713 --> 00:28:13,991
Corporal, ready fighter!

371
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:19,240
Initiating Severacek Protocol zeta! Another12
penguins taken from the London Zoo.

372
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,242
Okay, boys, this is it. Mission,
who is preparing for a lifetime.

373
00:28:24,362 --> 00:28:26,856
Be defeat Dave or die!

374
00:28:26,976 --> 00:28:29,828
Kova lsky, revoke our training.
Riko, armament.

375
00:28:30,254 --> 00:28:32,102
Pawn, do that thing,
what I like.

376
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:34,612
It's still fun.

377
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:37,601
Captain, good news.
They appreciated our class!

378
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:41,878
Sir, the jet is ready.
Great babe, how Superbowl19th

379
00:28:41,998 --> 00:28:43,512
They steal my stuff!

380
00:28:43,995 --> 00:28:44,840
No!

381
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,784
This mission has no place for pathetic
unnecessary wobble penguins.

382
00:28:47,904 --> 00:28:50,012
Who are you calling a pathetic?
Enough!

383
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:55,148
See Riko, making
You can not have a nice day!

384
00:28:57,441 --> 00:28:58,441
You know

385
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,148
fairly well
I control the computer.

386
00:29:10,076 --> 00:29:12,422
Put your pajamas, penguins.

387
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,089
They are adorable,
even in sleep.

388
00:29:16,209 --> 00:29:19,192
Not like me.
I want to give me these balls

389
00:29:19,312 --> 00:29:21,697
leave off of trips and missions.

390
00:29:21,817 --> 00:29:25,947
Send them off to some of our hiding place,
place on a distant planet.

391
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,075
<i>Recipient: Madagascar</i>

392
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:35,331
Where do we board?
There is little oxygen.

393
00:29:36,077 --> 00:29:38,008
Proposes to limit our breathing.

394
00:29:39,626 --> 00:29:40,626
Au, pawn!

395
00:29:43,707 --> 00:29:45,801
Excuse me, I become
gas during the flight.

396
00:29:45,921 --> 00:29:48,346
And even when sleeping.
We must be on the plane.

397
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:52,919
What we Severac done?

398
00:29:53,422 --> 00:29:54,896
They gave us badges!

399
00:29:55,765 --> 00:29:58,612
No badges, tranquilizer darts.

400
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:03,573
Utajeny. The ground floor, dirty dog
We are trying to put out the mission!

401
00:30:03,693 --> 00:30:07,701
They think that we can not save
penguins, because we only penguins.

402
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:11,177
Penguins are our body and kind.
They are us.

403
00:30:11,297 --> 00:30:14,292
A single one of us can save us.

404
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:18,684
But Captain, we are at5 mil.
This significantly limits our options.

405
00:30:18,804 --> 00:30:20,868
I'll do my custom options.

406
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,203
A great move, Captain.

407
00:30:28,554 --> 00:30:30,514
But now it seems,
that we are out of the aircraft.

408
00:30:30,616 --> 00:30:32,558
I was a little got carried away.

409
00:30:32,678 --> 00:30:34,852
Well, at least we have
good view.

410
00:30:34,972 --> 00:30:37,973
Well, Kowalski.
Your turn, collect margin.

411
00:30:39,377 --> 00:30:41,453
Why not catch plane?

412
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,617
Collision with birds, Write it.

413
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,649
We next destination
at12 o'clock.

414
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:49,628
Well, there's only11:30th

415
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:52,958
Follow me boys.
Now we will be hot.

416
00:30:53,078 --> 00:30:55,385
<i>The heat hot hot...</i>

417
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:57,552
Nobody loves showing off Pesak.

418
00:30:57,672 --> 00:30:59,072
We're heading into the first grade!

419
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:07,741
I'm OK.
Kovalsky, where the aircraft is flying?

420
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:11,678
According to the strange shape of the rolls
I guess we're going to Paris.

421
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:14,236
France? Forget it!
...

422
00:31:14,356 --> 00:31:16,967
Then I suggest moving air.
Is approved.

423
00:31:17,087 --> 00:31:19,666
Peanut, peanuts, peanuts...

424
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,198
Bingo!
There is n AS years, boys.

425
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:29,680
I can not stay, doll.
Dangerous, my dear.

426
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:31,852
Riko, supra.

427
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:35,090
Stop stop stop ...

428
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,471
We leave just in time because...

429
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,053
Unroll flap

430
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,177
Aim for the goal.

431
00:31:44,441 --> 00:31:46,329
We'll catch him, we catch him.

432
00:31:47,329 --> 00:31:49,262
Ojoj! We did not catch him!

433
00:31:49,382 --> 00:31:52,102
WAIT a minute.
Where is the captain?

434
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:54,354
Time to become creative.

435
00:31:54,474 --> 00:31:56,398
Start catch boxes, boys.

436
00:31:57,241 --> 00:31:58,689
I'm going away!

437
00:32:00,873 --> 00:32:04,867
Oh pawn, stop playing with those
backpacks, find something useful.

438
00:32:06,481 --> 00:32:08,888
We are together now.
Let's get to work!

439
00:32:09,008 --> 00:32:13,088

Call American, Kovalsky!

00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:17,482
Excuse me, sir.

441
00:32:25,584 --> 00:32:29,242
Okay. Clearly,
what we need to do.

442
00:32:29,362 --> 00:32:30,577
<i>An hour later,</i>

443
00:32:34,473 --> 00:32:35,751
That is fine!

444
00:32:36,434 --> 00:32:40,031
Great swing, boys.
Now back to civilization.

445
00:32:40,462 --> 00:32:44,939
We're going to remove Dexter.
We need to know where to attack again.

446
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:05,512
Alojz, he could get them
Please take?

447
00:33:16,748 --> 00:33:20,383
Traces of penguins are still fresh.
We just missed Dave.

448
00:33:20,503 --> 00:33:24,174
Sto thunder is gone!
So many penguins!

449
00:33:25,781 --> 00:33:28,386
Again stressful!
Corporal.

450
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,142
Found.
Unleash the wrath of the stomach.

451
00:33:31,262 --> 00:33:33,822
Corporal, concentrate!

452
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:37,482
We're going to save those
Powerless penguins because

453
00:33:37,994 --> 00:33:41,295
We are Northern Wind and nobody

454
00:33:41,576 --> 00:33:44,380
one can stop the wind!

455
00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:49,827
Wind never stops!
That's right, Corporal.

456
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:53,125
We're the four penguins
rescued, however?

457
00:33:53,245 --> 00:33:56,249
We sent them in comfort
Madagascar to safety.

458
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:57,830
What does that pipe?

459
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,221
Lord, those penguins, never
redirected to Madagascar.

460
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:03,782
What? But where
Thus ticking?

461
00:34:08,031 --> 00:34:09,933
Kowalski, n what is ur location?

462
00:34:10,053 --> 00:34:13,814
According to my calculations, we
came to the city of Dublin in Ireland.

463
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:19,396
Well soldiers
will merge with the crowd.

464
00:34:19,635 --> 00:34:20,635
River dance.

465
00:34:26,425 --> 00:34:28,812
There is no time to watch
sights, boys.

466
00:34:28,932 --> 00:34:31,753
We need to find a clue
about Daveovej position. Rushing!

467
00:34:37,768 --> 00:34:40,117
Okay. Ty! Where is Dave?
Give us a clue!

468
00:34:41,867 --> 00:34:44,323
Sir, it is small cuttlefish.

469
00:34:48,905 --> 00:34:50,064
Sorry, kid.

470
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,803
Shipwreck on the Emerald
the island without a single key!

471
00:34:54,923 --> 00:34:58,798
This is the luck of the Irish?
Captain, see!

472
00:35:03,513 --> 00:35:05,265
Someone speaks Irish?

473
00:35:05,385 --> 00:35:07,525
No, but it seems
Dave that it makes.

474
00:35:07,728 --> 00:35:09,935
He stole penguins
of Guadalajara.

475

That is, every zoo and aquarium,
from which it kicked!

482
00:35:27,355 --> 00:35:28,894
Do not tell me where it was.

483
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:31,412
Tell me, where it is now?

484
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:33,430
Wait, What do you want, Riko?

485
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,324
Is it a book? Film? The game?
The first word of two syllables...

486
00:35:37,444 --> 00:35:40,265
Sounds like hue.
Sounds like Hue?

487
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:41,963
Sounds like Hie?

488
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,548
What begins with Hie?

489

Shanghai.

490

There Dave not yet, Captain.

491
00:35:52,879 --> 00:35:54,857
If we move,
We can still stop him.

492
00:35:54,977 --> 00:35:56,367
Good work, Riko.

00:38:21,151 --> 00:38:23,007
Can you help me with it?

528
00:38:25,306 --> 00:38:26,691
Aye, aye, Captain.

529
00:38:26,811 --> 00:38:29,077
Hey, it's quick study.

530
00:38:30,753 --> 00:38:33,402
Pawn, 10 yards of impact.

531
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:35,527
Pawn, a poised?

532
00:38:36,261 --> 00:38:38,601

Aperture up!

The target is stunned!
Riko, manufacture puddle!

538
00:39:20,897 --> 00:39:24,889
What are you doing here, little one?
Well, back to your tank.

539
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:30,101
Protect Marine virgins and find

00:39:31,507 --> 00:39:33,488
David octopus.

541
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:38,304
A little late, Severac.

542
00:39:40,437 --> 00:39:43,028
Mission accomplished.
High applause!

543
00:39:44,373 --> 00:39:48,288
Corporal, take our prisoners,
which belongs to us, into custody!

544
00:39:48,978 --> 00:39:49,676
What?

545
00:39:49,796 --> 00:39:52,594
Melted him?
You're sick birds!

546
00:39:54,264 --> 00:39:56,246
He goes into the sewer.

547
00:40:00,725 --> 00:40:03,003
Captain!
Pawn?

548
00:40:03,123 --> 00:40:04,204
Pawn!

549
00:40:04,324 --> 00:40:05,749
Get out of there.

550
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,563
No no no, Pawn!

551
00:40:08,683 --> 00:40:09,683
Captain!

552
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:11,429
Pawn.

553
00:40:11,962 --> 00:40:13,148
Help!

Captain, aircraft Severak!
Great, celestial chariot!

557
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,035
But you know with that fly?
There is only one way to find out.

558
00:40:35,481 --> 00:40:38,086
No, I still do not get it.

559
00:40:38,586 --> 00:40:40,521
Let's go without books.

560
00:40:48,202 --> 00:40:49,732
No no no!

561
00:40:52,024 --> 00:40:53,914
Too, too, too!

562
00:41:01,029 --> 00:41:03,821
I'm beginning to go, Captain.
Soar!

563
00:41:04,164 --> 00:41:06,848
Well! We're going
behind you, pawn!

564
00:41:08,311 --> 00:41:11,994
These ridiculous butter balls
David let escape!

565
00:41:12,244 --> 00:41:13,778
Eva, secure transport!

566
00:41:13,898 --> 00:41:15,880
Gunny and corporal
grab our disposal!

567
00:41:21,498 --> 00:41:22,498
Pal!

568
00:41:25,992 --> 00:41:27,038
The great thing.

569
00:41:40,733 --> 00:41:42,107
Hold it steady.

570
00:41:52,014 --> 00:41:54,589
Sir, Dave recedes.
We're too heavy.

571
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:57,668
Our cursed heavy diet
Krupinka with cheese.

572
00:41:57,788 --> 00:42:01,574
Riko, finds all unnecessary.
Everything must go away!

573
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:07,669
What is it? NO!

574
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:12,348
That's all, sir. We must
chemical toilet drain.

575
00:42:12,468 --> 00:42:14,586
But Riko's Day
already15 minutes!

576
00:42:14,706 --> 00:42:16,117
Just do it!

577
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:25,544

Captain's Log.

583
00:42:57,618 --> 00:43:00,926
Pawn was captured Dave

584
00:43:01,863 --> 00:43:05,483
and we are carried by the current
perhaps for several days.

585
00:43:06,013 --> 00:43:11,194
No food, drinking water,
no visible ground.

586
00:43:13,904 --> 00:43:16,589
Kovalsky is sick as a dog

587
00:43:17,133 --> 00:43:20,195
Riko and it still tries to eat.

588
00:43:20,315 --> 00:43:22,646
Please limit it.

589
00:43:24,332 --> 00:43:27,675
We do not know how long
It still endure.

590
00:43:27,795 --> 00:43:30,558
Perhaps this is my last record.

591
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:35,401
Champagne2000 tracks

592
00:43:35,521 --> 00:43:37,220
That sounds good.

593
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,570
I've never been more hydrated!

594
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:44,584
If you do not mind, I cut off a piece of elk.
It is the greatest delicacy on this boat.

595
00:43:44,704 --> 00:43:46,612
I need to allow the belt.

596
00:43:46,732 --> 00:43:49,703
No, I'm full.
Just throw it into the sea.

597
00:43:50,178 --> 00:43:53,206
Did you know that we're all here
in a common boat?

598
00:43:53,326 --> 00:43:54,981
Actually we are not.

599
00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:58,636
And maybe you should
a little more aware of the fact

600
00:43:58,756 --> 00:44:02,164
that you stole and destroyed
vehicle for $90 million.

601
00:44:02,763 --> 00:44:06,473
Entered in the accounts to me.
Corporal, Corporal!

602
00:44:06,593 --> 00:44:08,652
We catch the signal, sir.

603
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:09,448
Yes?

604
00:44:09,568 --> 00:44:14,536
5 km southwest. But he stopped
to navigate that distant island.

605
00:44:14,656 --> 00:44:15,656
Country?

606
00:44:17,377 --> 00:44:20,251
You're doing well!
Have you found the ground!

607
00:44:20,371 --> 00:44:24,608
No silly, we Stop your

Ty ground, dirty, rotten, dishonest,
Flea smelling the toilet drinker!

611
00:44:40,802 --> 00:44:42,749
But... well.

I bet you are dying

He kills all of us!
What? No!

619
00:45:47,646 --> 00:45:52,349
My serum jellyfish anyone

620
00:45:52,469 --> 00:45:57,516
So what does Dave?
Something much, much worse.

621
00:45:59,669 --> 00:46:02,852
Okay, but what does it
namely: doing?

622
00:46:03,516 --> 00:46:07,339
Well, that's exactly what I
you came here to show off.

623
00:46:07,459 --> 00:46:09,251
I just need volunteer.

624
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:11,664
Hello. sweetie.

625
00:46:15,348 --> 00:46:21,843
Look how I break
the full force of serum jellyfish.

626
00:46:23,244 --> 00:46:24,244
Pal!

627
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:32,273
Yes, it works!

628
00:46:34,686 --> 00:46:38,622
I've created a monster!
I've created a monster!

629
00:46:38,742 --> 00:46:42,150

<i>The Monster!
Monstrous! Monstrous!</i>

631
00:46:44,598 --> 00:46:45,879
Who said that?

632
00:46:47,645 --> 00:46:51,237
No.

633
00:46:55,633 --> 00:46:56,851
Yes!

634
00:46:57,426 --> 00:47:00,135
Gentlemen, do you remember pawn?

635
00:47:01,942 --> 00:47:04,518
This will never fails, Dave!

636
00:47:04,638 --> 00:47:09,342
My brothers and come together
frustrate your entire operation.

637
00:47:09,462 --> 00:47:11,858
Everyone quit hunting.

Eva, what do you see?

641
00:47:29,939 --> 00:47:32,552
I counted 30 enemies.

643
00:47:35,718 --> 00:47:39,442
Ah, thither are two
very close together.

644
00:47:39,562 --> 00:47:43,525
I am going to, you know,
together physically. But...

645
00:47:45,104 --> 00:47:48,209
Do not talk about their
weakness, Kovalsky.

646
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:52,955
Poor pawn. Alone.
Helpless in the stomach of the beast.

647
00:47:53,075 --> 00:47:56,600
We encountered already lengthy
difficulties, Captain.

648
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,763
But these seem to be
the longest. The strangest.

649
00:47:59,883 --> 00:48:02,904
If we want to overcome
we need a diversion.

650
00:48:03,024 --> 00:48:05,508
<i>Deactivate jungle camouflage</i>

651
00:48:05,628 --> 00:48:07,637
Can you be quiet?
Listen, Utajeny...

652
00:48:07,757 --> 00:48:10,562
The manager had them
fetter on the boat!

653
00:48:10,682 --> 00:48:12,201
Nehologramujte me!

654
00:48:12,321 --> 00:48:18,076
But they do not have hands, they only have wings,
boss. I have my wings. It would be useless!

655
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:19,476
Well, boy.

656
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:23,026
If you do not work with us,
You'd better work for us.

657
00:48:23,146 --> 00:48:25,055
Our plan needs a diversion.

658
00:48:25,175 --> 00:48:28,399
I'm in charge here, and although I was
harasses need be

660
00:48:31,635 --> 00:48:35,462
No! This is our plan and needs you

We have a kiss?
Plan it.

664
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:48,225
Yes, the plan.
That's what I was going to say.

And this young, helpless,
grit is vulnerable pawn.

668
00:48:59,915 --> 00:49:01,647
And this is Dave.

00:49:02,615 --> 00:49:05,923
Why do you want bouncer
diversion octopus?

670
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,263

<i>Let's go.

00:51:08,134 --> 00:51:10,474
It must be awful feeling.

702
00:51:11,645 --> 00:51:15,067
I can not imagine
the guilt, remorse.

703
00:51:15,187 --> 00:51:19,447
The feeling you know,
You should have it.

704
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,602
Who is behind schedule penguins?

705
00:51:30,225 --> 00:51:32,690
Who is behind schedule Norther?

706
00:51:37,925 --> 00:51:39,516
His

707
00:51:39,636 --> 00:51:41,534
it is better.

708
00:51:41,654 --> 00:51:42,786
What?

709
00:51:45,049 --> 00:51:48,857
Sorry guys, but this time
you can not lead.

710
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:57,196
We are a team and you're our captain.
We do not need these guys.

711
00:51:57,316 --> 00:52:00,307
We do not Kovalsky,
but Pesak yes.

712
00:52:00,704 --> 00:52:05,413
I think this time
Leave professionals.

713
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:07,457
Oh, Lord!
It's decided.

714
00:52:07,577 --> 00:52:10,660
Now bend to secret agent.

715
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:12,489
That's an order, Riko!

716
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:23,903
Well hidden,
what is the diversion?

717
00:52:33,591 --> 00:52:36,905
This is a shame we take to my grave.
I agree.

718
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,288
Time?
- 22:00,

719
00:53:13,408 --> 00:53:15,166
Time to beat Dave!

720
00:53:37,726 --> 00:53:39,284
Octopus David,

721
00:53:39,744 --> 00:53:41,531
show me their tentacles.

722
00:53:44,587 --> 00:53:45,587
All of them.

723
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:05,749
I think we lost them, Captain.

724
00:54:05,858 --> 00:54:09,912
It's about time these pants
do not wear it in my Bundesliga.

725
00:54:10,604 --> 00:54:14,205
Quickly boys, take your
coconuts and firmly hold them.

726
00:54:14,781 --> 00:54:18,094
Utajeny should go
from massive explosions

727
00:54:18,214 --> 00:54:21,293
s pawn on his shoulders
for3 ...2...

728
00:54:21,413 --> 00:54:23,520
Greet him home again, Riko!

729
00:54:28,591 --> 00:54:30,678
The infantryman is back!
Welcome home!

730
00:54:34,185 --> 00:54:37,233
Sir, the submarine did not explode.

731
00:54:37,696 --> 00:54:41,317
And I'm afraid that fireworks
was probably a tactical mistake.

732
00:54:50,602 --> 00:54:55,225
<i>Stay calm!
Do not panic! Still to win!</i>

733
00:54:55,345 --> 00:55:00,766
His delight in! Stop hating!
Dream away! Love it! Love other people!

734
00:55:00,886 --> 00:55:04,635
Judiciously choose life combat.
Do not let anyone control.

735
00:55:07,278 --> 00:55:08,749
Eva!

736
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,166
I know.

737
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:23,502
Welcome! The captain, a Kovalsky
avid Riko! There's a whole gang!

738
00:55:23,622 --> 00:55:27,844
The mood is electrifying.
They really are all finally here?

739
00:55:27,964 --> 00:55:30,955
Well Dave. But what
did... pawn!

740
00:55:31,075 --> 00:55:34,321
Oh buddies.
Now in porridge, Dave!

741
00:55:34,441 --> 00:55:37,207
Really? Anyway,
timely speech.

742
00:55:37,327 --> 00:55:40,792
Who else is ready
to test penguins live?

743
00:55:40,912 --> 00:55:43,960
Immediately put away the
death ray from Pesci!

744
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,845
It is not deadly, Captain,
but change us monsters!

745
00:55:47,965 --> 00:55:51,283
Tralala! And what comes
then, Dave?

746
00:55:51,403 --> 00:55:54,712
Invasion! Fearful
mutated penguins

747
00:55:54,832 --> 00:55:57,463
Discharge into the streets
New York!

748
00:55:57,583 --> 00:56:01,525
You're a monster.
Yes, I'm a monster

749
00:56:01,645 --> 00:56:06,134
all it gave me clear
every day of my life.

750
00:56:06,254 --> 00:56:11,364
But now let's see how much you will
all love when you're going monsters.

751
00:56:11,484 --> 00:56:12,184
Captain!

752
00:56:12,304 --> 00:56:15,926
You can not take pawns tenderness.
It's a feature!

753
00:56:16,046 --> 00:56:19,055
What?
That's all it is the babe!

754
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,597
Hm. Si supermilucky.
I prefer to run.

755
00:56:22,717 --> 00:56:24,657
Drew, Barry, more electricity.

756
00:56:24,777 --> 00:56:27,092
Are you ready?
Negotiations have been infringed.

757
00:56:27,212 --> 00:56:29,542
Riko, paperclip.
Get us out of here.

758
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:32,601
We need that clip.
Shot soldier!

759
00:56:35,956 --> 00:56:38,521
Riko where the clip?

760
00:56:40,394 --> 00:56:41,580
Pawn!

761
00:56:47,713 --> 00:56:49,055
No!

762
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,164
Pawn!
For them.

763
00:56:58,062 --> 00:57:00,294
I had disintegrated.

764
00:57:00,777 --> 00:57:02,775
That's what I expected.

765
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:06,302
You maniac!
He crushed it.

766
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,206
No.

767
00:57:08,549 --> 00:57:11,686
Well. Because of this,
things we test people.

768
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:14,792
I'll have to shrink
current for others.

769
00:57:16,212 --> 00:57:18,069
Full steam ahead, gentlemen.

770
00:57:18,189 --> 00:57:21,081
Monsters must come to Manhattan.

771
00:57:46,642 --> 00:57:47,642
Sorry.

772
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:01,405
Uh-oh.

773
00:58:02,607 --> 00:58:04,230
Well, octopus!

774
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:07,163
Anything you Dave promised
I can double it!

775
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,286
This indicates yes? Do you understand
someone speech octopus?

776
00:58:10,406 --> 00:58:11,914
I'm sorry.
I do not know.

777
00:58:12,034 --> 00:58:13,034
Vanity.

778
00:58:13,117 --> 00:58:20,280
Ty Free us.
My give you benefits!

779
00:58:24,653 --> 00:58:26,135
What is it?

780
00:58:32,512 --> 00:58:34,353
No, great.
No, it's terrible!

781
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:36,704
I do not want to die battered.

782
00:58:40,413 --> 00:58:43,475
Dead, dead, dead, dead.

783
00:58:43,595 --> 00:58:45,596
Oh no, We're dead!

784
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:47,409
Dead.

785
00:58:47,715 --> 00:58:49,026
Dead!

786
00:58:51,746 --> 00:58:53,648
I pressed the button!

787
00:58:54,284 --> 00:58:57,951
Super, great Pesak!
Well done, little one!

788
00:58:58,071 --> 00:59:02,189
Aano, yes, great
pressing a button!

789
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:04,564
Compliment, respect, etc.

790
00:59:04,684 --> 00:59:07,637
Well agents Again we work.

791
00:59:10,624 --> 00:59:12,856
Wait!
Captain, Kovalsky, Riko

792
00:59:12,976 --> 00:59:15,328
and all penguins are this way!

793
00:59:15,448 --> 00:59:16,990
There is a large Army octopuses.

794
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:20,979
And as soon as we return to our base
and take your new gear

795
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:24,739
and think of new destructive plan
quickly come and beat Dave.

796
00:59:24,859 --> 00:59:28,010
But penguins are endangered!
We have to go now.

797
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:30,639
Again, large Army octopuses.

798
00:59:30,759 --> 00:59:33,558
So because you have one
failed, are you running?

799
00:59:33,678 --> 00:59:36,598
We failed and run away,

800
00:59:36,718 --> 00:59:38,605
Just be very careful regroup.

801
00:59:38,725 --> 00:59:42,824
Captain would not bother
plan or not, great outfit or not.

802
00:59:42,944 --> 00:59:45,446
He would never left the man.

803
00:59:45,566 --> 00:59:48,800
I believe that everyone
Penguins can not be, right?

804
00:59:54,908 --> 00:59:55,908
No.

805
00:59:56,957 --> 00:59:59,042
But maybe you should be.

806
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:07,393
Let's go.

807
01:00:16,257 --> 01:00:19,941
It's showtime,
big smiles for New York!

808
01:00:20,061 --> 01:00:23,943
Listen, Doris. You're changing the
the madman, but then what?

809
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:27,841
Think you why
everyone will love?

810
01:00:28,133 --> 01:00:30,592
No, but I despise you.

811
01:00:33,973 --> 01:00:36,296
And I like it surely enjoy it!

812
01:00:45,596 --> 01:00:48,430
Special Report!
Disappearance penguins were found!

813
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:52,337
According to my notes, gene
engineer Dr. Oktavius Brine

814
01:00:52,457 --> 01:00:55,276
found penguins and brings them
here in Central Park in NY

815
01:00:55,396 --> 01:00:58,144
Penguins are returning!
Wow Oh look!

816
01:01:11,341 --> 01:01:12,390
Look!

817
01:01:24,836 --> 01:01:27,070
Lovers penguins around the world

818
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:29,309
I believe that love them

819
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:32,043
It was not easy

820
01:01:32,163 --> 01:01:37,442
But the prospect that the penguins get everything
what belongs to them, it will be worth it.

821
01:01:37,562 --> 01:01:40,948
What a strange speech.
I'm so excited!

822
01:01:41,276 --> 01:01:42,726
Do it.

823
01:01:54,234 --> 01:01:57,508
Captain, Captain, Captain,
Riko, Kovalsky!

824
01:01:57,628 --> 01:02:01,283
As if I've ever heard
his voice calling us.

825
01:02:01,403 --> 01:02:04,005
<i>You have to go
stade away! Move it!</i>

826
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:07,352
You have to go
stade away. Mou!

827
01:02:07,472 --> 01:02:10,046
Why would Mukalla?
Why are you asking me?

828
01:02:10,166 --> 01:02:12,496
I'm not a pawn, Oh dear.

829
01:02:18,164 --> 01:02:19,353
No!

830
01:02:21,147 --> 01:02:23,527
Are you ready?

831
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:29,772
Yes!

832
01:02:33,985 --> 01:02:35,488
Your new

833
01:02:36,365 --> 01:02:37,855
and improvements

834
01:02:38,199 --> 01:02:39,571
penguins!

835
01:02:42,928 --> 01:02:47,148
Penguins! Penguins!

836
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:50,854
What?

837
01:02:59,437 --> 01:03:03,261
Oh, people love you.
Just hug!

838
01:03:22,096 --> 01:03:26,359
For them. Is it me?
Nobody does not like anymore?

839
01:03:26,479 --> 01:03:29,858
Thus, a cheerful game begins.
Watch penguins.

840
01:03:29,978 --> 01:03:32,763
Someone call liquidators!

841
01:03:37,694 --> 01:03:41,169
<i>Pest control / penguin</i>

842
01:03:41,289 --> 01:03:45,738
And when you remove liquidators,
never more return!

843
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,661
Oh dear! Oh no! Oh no!
What should I do?

844
01:04:15,622 --> 01:04:16,981
Ojoj!

845
01:04:21,325 --> 01:04:24,436
Come on. Do you want to go?
Want to guess?

846
01:04:49,205 --> 01:04:50,394
Oho, this!

847
01:04:52,495 --> 01:04:54,114
What a wonderful day in the park.

848
01:04:54,774 --> 01:04:55,774
Captain.

849
01:05:00,852 --> 01:05:01,852
Wait.

850
01:05:03,701 --> 01:05:05,540
For them.
What are you doing?

851
01:05:08,854 --> 01:05:09,854
Captain.

852
01:05:11,443 --> 01:05:12,443
Do not eat it.

853
01:05:13,591 --> 01:05:15,031
Captain, listen.

854
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,720
It's me, pawn.

855
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:18,998
I have a plan, but
I need your help.

856
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,359
I need his captain.

857
01:05:35,241 --> 01:05:36,930
<i>The family Pesak</i>

858
01:05:42,336 --> 01:05:45,074
Pawn?
Yes, exactly.

859
01:05:45,194 --> 01:05:46,813
Pawn, you're alive!

860
01:05:49,151 --> 01:05:50,151
Yes.

861
01:06:03,344 --> 01:06:05,212
Kovalsky, wake up!

862
01:06:06,763 --> 01:06:09,561
Kovalsky, Eva worried about you.

863
01:06:09,681 --> 01:06:13,292
Really? What did she say?
Explicitly said my name?

864
01:06:13,412 --> 01:06:16,830
I think that even with tears?
Details! Speak up!

865
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:19,588
Pawn, you're alive!
Come here.

866
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:22,802
Maybe it does not fit here,
But I'm happy.

867
01:06:26,977 --> 01:06:29,444
Riko, you have control.

868
01:06:29,564 --> 01:06:32,117
Although I think it
so normally did.

869
01:06:32,237 --> 01:06:33,288
Female friend!

870
01:06:34,103 --> 01:06:35,103
Attention!

871
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:40,181
It seems that we
back again, boys

872
01:06:40,301 --> 01:06:43,005
and our work Save the penguins.

873
01:06:43,302 --> 01:06:45,507
Who is added?
I'm in.

874
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:47,047
Join.
Let's do it!

875
01:06:47,765 --> 01:06:49,888
Let's create a memorable moment.

876
01:06:54,608 --> 01:06:57,136
Sir, how long have
thus we stand?

877
01:06:57,256 --> 01:07:00,007
Until we achieve
maximum splendor.

878
01:07:02,836 --> 01:07:05,910
And there is. Now only
we need a plan.

879
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:07,642
I got the poison!

880
01:07:10,785 --> 01:07:13,260
You stole Dave beam?

881
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:16,278
I found that if you we can turn

882
01:07:16,398 --> 01:07:18,728
and return all to normal!

883
01:07:18,848 --> 01:07:21,458
Consult beam?
This is brilliant

884
01:07:21,578 --> 01:07:24,468
but impossible.
To turn beam

885
01:07:24,588 --> 01:07:27,054
we would have to replace
Serum jellyfish

886
01:07:27,174 --> 01:07:29,816
drive almost immense tenderness.

887
01:07:29,936 --> 01:07:33,421
Measureless tenderness,
where we gathered it?

888
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:48,020
No, wait a pawn!
We do not know what I would do!

889
01:07:49,947 --> 01:07:53,507
All right!
The beam works!

890
01:07:53,627 --> 01:07:56,725
Pawn, are you okay?
Yes!

891
01:07:56,845 --> 01:07:58,751
Ble, hand on my ass!

892
01:07:58,871 --> 01:08:02,628
He's ass stuck his hand.
That was not there before.

893
01:08:02,748 --> 01:08:04,820
Get out of there.
That's an order!

894
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:06,893
Permission to disobey.
Enabling rejected.

895
01:08:07,013 --> 01:08:08,697
Then refuse your refusal.

896
01:08:08,817 --> 01:08:11,722
Too risky pawn.
Have you increased the hand.

897
01:08:11,842 --> 01:08:14,257
I know that this time my turn.

898
01:08:14,988 --> 01:08:17,451
And I think you know it well.

899
01:08:30,655 --> 01:08:32,785
I have a secret weapon.

900
01:08:42,639 --> 01:08:45,638
I am happy yet

901
01:08:46,536 --> 01:08:49,324
Now, when I his revenge

902
01:08:49,444 --> 01:08:52,859
I feel empty, like everything

903
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:57,077
I needed all the time,
was more revenge!

904
01:08:57,197 --> 01:08:58,905
Actually, Robin,
this registration.

905
01:08:59,025 --> 01:09:01,400
Tomorrow we go the kittens

906
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,853
then the dog, bunny, Panday!

907
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:08,151
Charlize, are farewell.

908
01:09:09,721 --> 01:09:11,252
Helena, and take them.

909
01:09:11,372 --> 01:09:12,676
William, hurting them.

910
01:09:12,796 --> 01:09:14,068
Halle, their trench.

911
01:09:14,188 --> 01:09:16,294
Hugh, Jack, above our station.

912
01:09:16,414 --> 01:09:17,746
Kevin furnace!

913
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:20,471
I still do not have
winning cake!

914
01:09:27,602 --> 01:09:30,182
We have just one shot, boys.

915
01:09:30,302 --> 01:09:32,605
What we do it comes with globes?

916
01:09:32,725 --> 01:09:35,730
Beam splitter ready!
Fire as needed!

917
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:37,844
Do it, Captain!

918
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,299
Discharged flashlights!

919
01:09:51,548 --> 01:09:52,985
End of the game, Captain.

920
01:09:54,832 --> 01:09:55,832
No!

921
01:09:56,838 --> 01:09:58,718
Riko, flashlights.

922
01:09:58,838 --> 01:10:01,386
Captain, Kovalsky,
Vehicle protection.

923
01:10:01,506 --> 01:10:03,935
Let's do it now!

924
01:10:04,347 --> 01:10:06,669
Did you hear Pesca?
Go!

925
01:10:19,088 --> 01:10:20,285
<i>Batteries</i>

926
01:10:20,759 --> 01:10:22,057

927
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,323
Riko go from the other side!

928
01:10:35,443 --> 01:10:37,627
We're just two
and they are many.

929
01:10:57,734 --> 01:10:59,271
You are returned!

930
01:11:07,433 --> 01:11:10,618
Au, so we have to be
Explosion cautious.

931
01:11:24,505 --> 01:11:25,920
Maintain position!

932
01:11:27,212 --> 01:11:29,178
Stay away from pawn!

933
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:35,508
Suck, Kovalsky?

934
01:11:37,767 --> 01:11:38,767
No!

935
01:11:38,984 --> 01:11:41,057
It's over, Captain.

936
01:11:41,177 --> 01:11:43,203
The end?
This is weird.

937
01:11:43,323 --> 01:11:46,538
So why do Riko bears
fresh pair of batteries!

938
01:11:52,146 --> 01:11:53,146
Driver!

939
01:12:00,424 --> 01:12:01,992
Riko, give me crackers!

Pawn.

943
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:04,162
Sorry. We walk.
Come down the aisle!

944
01:13:08,004 --> 01:13:09,850
Oh no!
Do not worry!

945
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:14,043
Just around you creates
hood, it is completely normal.

946
01:13:25,895 --> 01:13:27,096
Pawn.

947
01:13:29,296 --> 01:13:30,357
What?

948
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:37,906
Pawn?

949
01:13:41,762 --> 01:13:43,836
Check out majestic!

950
01:13:43,956 --> 01:13:44,964
Ahojte.

951
01:13:47,482 --> 01:13:49,591
What is it?
Oh no, cautiously.

952
01:13:49,711 --> 01:13:51,590
Cautiously.
Cover your eyes.

953
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:53,479
Wobbles his head.
What is it?

954
01:13:53,599 --> 01:13:54,646
So

How do I look?

956
01:13:57,710 --> 01:13:59,728
Your head is
hideously disfigured

957
01:13:59,848 --> 01:14:01,752
and probably
will be hunted for sport.

958
01:14:01,872 --> 01:14:03,948
What?
Very.

959
01:14:04,604 --> 01:14:06,960

964
01:14:37,999 --> 01:14:44,103
Yes sir, you were the most important
a valuable member of this team.

965
01:15:38,024 --> 01:15:39,160

What?
Mocking me?

968
01:15:50,992 --> 01:15:53,208

I hope you find lucky Dave.

975
01:16:15,603 --> 01:16:18,824
It's snowing! It's snowing! It's snowing!

976
01:16:21,782 --> 01:16:25,574
Snowden correctly!
It is hard to say this.

977
01:16:25,694 --> 01:16:28,430
It is osteoporosis?
You just have to accustom

978
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:30,869
vowels.
O-you-o-po-ro-za.

979
01:16:30,989 --> 01:16:32,253
No! No.

984
01:16:44,823 --> 01:16:47,710
Give us jetpack!
We could kiss.

985
01:16:48,225 --> 01:16:50,322
After... you just said?

986
01:16:54,817 --> 01:16:56,323
That was nice.

987

I'd rather
Desired jetpack, please.

988
01:16:59,206 --> 01:17:02,138
I think that we should
accept the idea of ??the pawns.

989
01:17:07,172 --> 01:17:09,328
Kovalsky what is our trajectory?

990
01:17:09,448 --> 01:17:12,258
95% of land on on wood?

991
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:14,322
What do you mean trouble?

992
01:17:14,442 --> 01:17:17,229
And the other5%?
They are irrelevant, sir.
