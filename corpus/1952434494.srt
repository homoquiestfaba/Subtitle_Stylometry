1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,480
You're history, Ninja Boy!

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,480
We'll teach you...

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,000
to keep your nose out 
 of our business!

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This if for the pizza and soda.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And this is for any damages.

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,520
Thanks.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,000
Hope you enjoyed your 
 la supper, Ninja Boy!

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yeah, your last supper.

9
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Use these they're old.

10
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,120
Sorry about the window, Joe.

11
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,120
Get him!

12
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,160
I hope you're not afraid of heights.

13
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,640
But I am afraid of heights.

14
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,640
You need professional help. 
 Get up there.

15
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,160
Going down.

16
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,680
Ah, let go of my hair!

17
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
You're stepping on my fingers.

18
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,680
That color looks good on you.

19
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,720
We'll make ninja burgers out of you!

20
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,720
Ahh!

21
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,240
Oh, I'm out of here.

22
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,240
Oops.

23
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
And cut!

24
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,760
Nice work, everybody. 
 That's going to be lunch, half hour.

25
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Watch out!

26
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,000
Look, look. Here it comes, 
 here it comes.

27
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
Watch this...

28
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,520
watch this.

29
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,520
And cut.

30
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,520
Luther!

31
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,520
Water.

32
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,040
Just like you like it,

33
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,560
I love it.

34
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Boy.

35
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,560
We love it too.

36
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,560
Yes, I thought you would.

37
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,080
You're golden, kid.

38
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,560
You've got the magic.

39
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
We found a caterer,

40
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,600
that will go for thirteen 
 dollars a plate.

41
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
That's chicken or the meatloaf.

42
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,600
We'll go with tuna for twelve.

43
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
Do it again.

44
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
Mr. Wadsworth,

45
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,120
any word on 
 "Muscle Monsters from Malibu"?

46
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,120
We go into production, you 
 guys are the first to know.

47
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Cool.

48
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
Ahh, don't forget the exhaust pipe, lad.

49
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,120
I hate dirty exhaust pipes.

50
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,640
He polishes David's tail pipes?

51
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,120
He doesn't polish my tail pipes.

52
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,120
Hey, when your finished 
 polish our tail pipes.

53
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
Yeah.

54
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Yeah, why don't you make me, huh?

55
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,640
On second thought 
 don't worry about it.

56
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,640
Now remember, 
 when Wil Shriner ask you,

57
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,640
your favorite food is 
 hamburger and french fries.

58
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,640
Your favorite TV show is 
 "Beverly Hills 90210"

59
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Oh, who's your favorite 
 baseball team?

60
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
The Chicago Cubs.

61
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,160
No. Atlanta braves, 
 they had a better season.

62
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,680
Let's go with a winner.

63
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
And...

64
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,680
when you grow up,

65
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,160
you want to be a jet fighter pilot.

66
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
No, I don't.

67
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,160
Yes, you do, remember I took you 
 to see that movie "Top Gun"?

68
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
You loved that movie.

69
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
I bought you that styrofoam glider.

70
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,680
You threw it for hours,

71
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,680
there's fighter pilot in your blood.

72
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Wait a second. I never saw Top Gun.

73
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Yeah, but we saw the 
 coming attractions.

74
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,680
The lines were too long.

75
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
ANNOUNCER: The Wil Shriner 
 Show will be right back

76
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
after these messages.

77
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,200
So when Wil Shriner asks you 
 to show us some of your stuff,

78
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,720
you'll ninja chop this wood.

79
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,720
Boy, you're stronger than you look.

80
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,720
It's just balsa wood, Uncle Bob. 
 I mean it's fake.

81
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,240
Hey, who needs the gym, huh?

82
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,760
The studio doesn't want 
 you to get hurt, Kevin.

83
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,240
Nobody will know the difference, 
 this is television.

84
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
I will.

85
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,760
Where's the coffee? 
 Where's my coffee!

86
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,760
Here.

87
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,280
It's about time. The logo goes 
 out. Idiot! Are you brainless?

88
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
- We're on the air in... 
 - Are you without a brain in your head?

89
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
- 5, 4, 3... 
 - You'll be working your butt on

90
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
- arsenio if you screw up again! 
 - 2, 1... go!

91
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
I'm surrounded by idiots.

92
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Oh, hi there and welcome back.

93
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,760
Now I want to thank 
 my good personal friend

94
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,280
Kevin Costner for dropping by.

95
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,760
I know he had to run cause 
 he's shooting a film.

96
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,280
But you all know my next 
 guest from his recurring role,

97
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,280
on the action adventure show 
 "No More Mr. Nice Guy".

98
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,800
All right, you're on, Kevin.

99
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,280
Don't forget anything we went over.

100
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
And the most important 
 thing to remember...

101
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,800
is to act honest and real.

102
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Oh! Don't forget the fake wood.

103
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Well, he's just completed work 
 on his own Motion Picture.

104
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,320
So ladies and gentlemen, please 
 welcome Hollywood's newest superstar,

105
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
and teen heartthorb,

106
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,800
the Ninja Boy himself,

107
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,320
Kevin Ryan. Kevin...

108
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
Hey, nice to have you on our show.

109
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,840
That's quite a little hand 
 shake you got there, Ninja Boy.

110
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,840
So, you must have to eat right, 
 exercise to stay in shape.

111
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,840
Well, my favorite food is 
 hamburger and french fries,

112
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,840
my favorite television show 
 is "Beverly Hills 90210",

113
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,360
my favorite baseball team 
 is the Alanta Braves

114
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
and I want to be a jet fighter pilot.

115
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,880
Wow, uh, I guess we'll just get 
 right into our demonstration then.

116
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
We have a little surprise 
 for you, Ninja Boy.

117
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,880
We wanted to see you in action,

118
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,360
so we invited kickboxing 
 champion, Eto Samaguci

119
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,880
over here to spar with you.

120
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,880
How's that for a surprise.

121
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
It'd be an honor.

122
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,360
Mr. Samaguchi, can I call you Sam?

123
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
What do you think of our 
 little Ninja Boy here?

124
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
What ever you say.

125
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Okay.

126
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Folks, don't try this at home.

127
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,920
They got large sticks. I had no 
 idea this was going to happen.

128
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,920
They look like large pieces of licorice.

129
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
He better pull this off.

130
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,960
He will. I'd stake my life on it.

131
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,960
And if he doesn't, strike that 
 last statement from the record.

132
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,960
Jay? Merv? Mike? Dave? 
 Arsenio? I'm okay.

133
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,480
I'm on camera, 
 get out of here, you idiot!

134
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
Ouch!

135
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
That was good, kid!

136
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,480
I'm sorry, let me help you.

137
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh! He cheats, 
 that guy cheats! He cheats!

138
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,040
Very nice. Ladies and gentlemen, 
 the Ninja Boy, Kevin Ryan.

139
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
Nicely done!

140
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,040
Mr. Samaguchi, here you 
 need this more than me.

141
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,560
What do you think of our Ninja Boy?

142
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,040
Yeah, two of those 
 and come misp soup.

143
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,080
We'll be right back after this 
 TV break. Don't go away!

144
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,080
Okay, how many?

145
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,560
I'll take two.

146
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
- Two. 
 - You?

147
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
Same here.

148
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,600
Two.

149
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
I'll take three.

150
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,600
Three. And Mr. Lucky takes three.

151
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,600
What's with the dog?

152
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,600
What do you mean, 
 what's the the dog.

153
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
He can't help the way 
 he looks, it's in his genes.

154
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
I'm not talking about genes.

155
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,120
I mean ever since he's been sitting 
 next to me, I haven't won a hand.

156
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,600
Talk about paranoid.

157
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,120
Hey, we're agents, 
 all agents are paranoid.

158
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
We should have been doctors.

159
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,640
Yeah.

160
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
I'll bet ten bucks.

161
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,640
Too rich for me.

162
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
I'm out.

163
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,160
I'll see your ten and 
 I bet another ten.

164
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Three ladies.

165
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
Read em' and weep... four deuces.

166
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,160
Okay, that does it. The dog is 
 cheating. You can tell by his eyes.

167
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,160
Manny, be reasonable.

168
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
Huh?

169
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
- What's he doing, Manny? 
 - What's he doing?

170
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
Is he sending signals?

171
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,680
Yeah, well, uh, two wags 
 of the talk... two pair.

172
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,200
Three wags... three of a kind.

173
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,680
For heaven's sake, he doesn't 
 even have a tail how can he wag?

174
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Yeah, well...

175
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,200
Calm down. All right, all right. 
 Buford, go on out.

176
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Go on up to Kevin's room.

177
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,680
You hurt his feelings, 
 I hope you're happy.

178
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,720
I don't care.

179
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
Okay, Kevin.

180
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
During the Lincoln administration

181
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,200
one of the most important things

182
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
was the emancipation proclamation.

183
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,200
Why was it so important?

184
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Well,

185
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,720
well, why was it so important?

186
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,240
Well, umm, isn't it true that 
 some people don't think

187
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
it's important at all?

188
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
Kevin, you didn't read 
 the chapter, did you?

189
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
What read the chapter? 
 Oh, you mean chapter seven.

190
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,720
It's chapter seven?

191
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,760
I'm sorry.

192
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
Okay.

193
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,240
We'll try again tomorrow.

194
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
And, Kevin...

195
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,760
get some sleep.

196
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,280
What are you looking at?

197
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
You think you're so smart?

198
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,280
You tell me why the emancipation 
 proclamation's so important then.

199
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
A pair of nines.

200
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,800
I don't like these plastic cards,

201
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,280
I think I read somewhere 
 they cause cancer.

202
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,280
Well, that's why I won't 
 eat them anymore.

203
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,800
And besides I think that test was 
 done with white mice playing go fish.

204
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
Two pair, jacks high.

205
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,320
Same thing only mine's got kings.

206
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,320
First it's the dog. Then it's her.

207
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,320
You just don't know how 
 to play fair, do you?

208
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
What are you talking about?

209
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Bob, can I speak to 
 you for a minute please?

210
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,320
Yeah, I'll be right there.

211
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,840
What's going on? 
 Changing secret signals?

212
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,840
You know you really need therapy. 
 Will you watch my chips.

213
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,320
I don't trust him.

214
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,840
You want to wait for him 
 or play another hand?

215
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,360
Well, we could dance, want to dance?

216
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,360
Oh, brother!

217
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,840
Bob, we have a problem.

218
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
What are you nuts?

219
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,360
There's no problem, 
 I'm up two hundred bucks.

220
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,360
I'm talking about Kevin. He's 
 falling way behind in his studies.

221
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,360
At this pace he won't be 
 ready for the tenth grade.

222
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,880
Are you kidding? He's like 
 one of the smartest kids I know.

223
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,360
He knew right away that 
 Bruce Wayne was really Batman.

224
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,880
Have you ever had one 
 of these? These are great.

225
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,880
No. No, thanks. I'm talking 
 about his education, Bob.

226
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,360
His future, his life.

227
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,400
His life, his future?

228
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
He's going to be a big 
 movie star. That's his life.

229
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
That's his future.

230
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,400
I have taught a lot of 
 different kids at the studios,

231
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
but Kevin is something special.

232
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,880
I'm going to fight for him.

233
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,920
And if you really care about him, 
 I suggest you do the same.

234
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,400
Jeez, what a hard ass.

235
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,440
You danced your last dance, Ninja Boy.

236
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,480
I need the money more than them.

237
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,960
You'll never get the money, 
 it belongs to the orphans.

238
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Ouch, ouch!

239
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,960
Ouch, ouch, where is that? 
 I don't have that ouch, ouch.

240
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,480
Now where is that in my script?

241
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,480
I just got soap in my eyes.

242
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,480
You're history, Ninja Boy, 
 say your prayers.

243
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You'll never get the money, 
 it belongs to the orphans.

244
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,480
No, no, no, no. Try it again. 
 Okay, now give it a lot more

245
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
feeling this time. A lot 
 more feeling. All right.

246
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
All right, go!

247
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,000
You'll never get the money, 
 it belongs to the orphans.

248
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Much better, much better!

249
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,520
Say your prayers, Ninja Boy.

250
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You'll never get the money, 
 it belongs to the orphans.

251
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,520
One more time and I think we got it.

252
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Okay.

253
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,000
Say your prayers, Ninja Boy,

254
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,520
you're history!

255
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
You'll never get the money...

256

Uncle Bob?

257
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,040
What, what?

258
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,040
Why was the emancipation 
 proclamation so important?

259
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,560
The emancipation proclamation?

260
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,560
Ah, of course.

261
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,040
It was important because before 
 the emancipation proclamation,

262
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,040
there was no such thing as 
 the free trade agreement,

263
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,560
which in turn gave President Lincoln

264
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,560
the idea of the concept 
 of double coupons.

265
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,080
Yeah, double coupons.

266
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,080

you're history!

No. No. Look at you! 
 Look at your hair.

279
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,640
Your hair is completely wrong.

Stay!

00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
Are you okay?

288
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,680
He's just fine, aren't you, Kevin?

289
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,680
There must have been 
 something slippery on the floor.

290
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,680
Could we possibly get a couple 
 of PA's to mop the floor?

291
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,200
We don't want to lose our 
 major star, do we, Kevin?

292
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,200
You know, David, it might 
 be good if he lays down

293
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,720
for a couple of minutes.

294
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,200
We're on a roll. The floor was 
 slippery. It's being handled. Okay?

295
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,720
It's okay, Uncle Bob. I just slipped.

The photographers?

305
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,800

 arranged a really big

surprise for you this evening.

00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,800
But I was supposed to be 
 with my tutor tonight.

308

Don't worry, she'll be paid. 
 Come on.

309
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,320
Okay, this is very nice. 
 Look at me. Don't blink. Don't blink.

 No, no, too much.

311
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,320
Okay, there you go. Look away 
 a little. Back to me. Back to me.

312

Don't blink. Here we go. 
 Don't blink.

What's that?

315
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
My history book.

316
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,840
Well, it's in my shot. Get rid of it.

317
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,360
Okay, now, show me 
 some teeth, Ninja Boy.

318
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
Great.

319
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,360
Good.

320
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,360
Okay. I've got what I need.

321
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,840
Wasn't that fun?

322
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,360
Come on, it's time

352
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
# I've got a leather heart like you #

353
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
# Hey, man #

354
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,520
# I'm what I am #

355
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,520
# I've got a leather heart like you #

356
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,040
# Deep in my soul #

357
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,520
# Lives rock and roll #

358
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,040
# I've got a leather heart #

359
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,560
Venus darling!

360
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,600
That was smashing!

361
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Absolutely smashing!

362
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,080
Thank you.

363
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,080
Venus, I'd like you to meet Kevin Ryan.

364
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Oh, Ninja Boy.

365
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,840
Hi.

366
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,120
I understand you're taking 
 me dancing tonight.

367
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
I am.

368
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
That's your big surprise tonight.

369
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,120
Now, it's our first date. 
 Absolutely no funny business.

370
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,120
Okay. Well, why don't we get 
 you two a little more aquainted.

371
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,640
Shall we?

372
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,640
Bye.

373
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,640
You know, David, I'm not quite 
 sure about this thing. You know?

374
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,160
I like it.

375
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,640
I think it's great.

376
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,640
They look great together. 
 It's the all American couple.

377
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:18,160
# I don't wait up for me 
 tonight, mama #

378
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,680
You just follow my lead, Ninja Boy.

379
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,680
We're gonna make the cover 
 of every tabloid in the nation.

380
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,760
I'm thirsty, Ninja Boy. 
 Will you get me a coke?

381
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,280
A coke?

382
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,760
A coke.

383
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,800
What's a hot babe like you doing 
 with a member of the Brady Bunch?

384
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,280
Him? The studio wanted 
 me to be seen with him.

385
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,800
He's supposed to be some 
 big ninja movie star.

386
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,280
He wouldn't be anything 
 without his stunt guys.

387
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,320
Nice cross. 
 I love a woman that's religious.

388
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,320
Excuse me.

389
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,320
Here's your coke.

390
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,320
Thank you.

391
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,840
Mind if I cut in for 
 the rest of the evening?

392
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,320
I don't want to dance with him.

393
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,320
I'm sorry, she doesn't 
 want to dance with you.

394
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,320
I'll determine that.

395
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,320
Besides...

396
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,840
you've got to go get changed.

397
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
Now go home, Poppa Smurf.

398
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,360
I don't believe you did that.

399
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,840
So what are you doing 
 later on anyway?

400
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,840
Hey, guy.

401
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,360
What?

402
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,360
Listen, buddy. 
 I don't want to hurt you.

403
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,360
You've got to be kidding.

404
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,360
Alright, Bruce Leroy.

405
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,360
You want to go?

406
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,360
Let's go.

407
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,480
I thought you said he was a phony.

408
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
I guess I lied.

409
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
I waited for you, Kevin.

410
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,000
I didn't know you 
 were going to be here.

411
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,520
The studio wanted me to go out.

412
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Well, that's a shame.

413
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Because we were going to start 
 something very important tonight.

414
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,520
I'm sorry.

415
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,000
The studio wanted me 
 to be seen in public.

416
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Well, I was here to teach 
 you about the civil war.

417
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,520
Did you learn anything about 
 the civil wat tonight, Kevin?

418
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,040
Tonight?

419
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Well, it was kind of a war,

420
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
but I don't know how civil it was.

421
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,040
The civil war the turning 
 point in our country's history.

422
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,040
I'm sorry you had to miss it.

423
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Oh, for God's sake, let me do that.

424
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,080
Never will learn to shuffle, will you?

425
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,560
Okay. Aces, deuces, fours, 
 and sevens are wild.

426
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,560
No. No. No. Dealers choice.

427
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,560
I'm the dealer, you're just doing it.

428
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,080
Alright, cut.

429
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,600
Who didn't anty?

430
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,080
You didn't.

431
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,080
I antyed.

432
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,080
You didn't anty. You never anty.

433
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,600
- I don't understand it. It's a dollar. 
 - I... I...

434
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,080
It's a dollar. What is it 
 to you? A dollar by God.

435
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,600
- But... 
 - Come on, it's not a life saver.

436
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,120
This is five card draw.

437
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,600
Don't put them all over the place.

438
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,120
Okay, what did you say was wild?

439
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,600
Ah...

440
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,120
Jacks, nines...

441
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,120
Well, you can't look at your cards and 
 then tell me what's wild for God sakes.

442
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
That's cheating.

443
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,120
- Definitely cheating. 
 - Who ever heard of that.

444
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
- Dealers choice. 
 - No. No. Miss deal.

445
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,120
- Well, let's see... 
 - That is cheating.

446
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,120
Let's make deuces wilds, and 
 I think I have a jack here.

447
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
He just, he just took this anty back.

448
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,640
You took the anty out again.

449
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,160
We're starting again.

450
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,640
Yeah, but it doesn't matter 
 we're starting a new game.

451
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,160
We're not taking a break here. 
 You keep taking the anty out.

452
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Okay, five card stud.

453
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,160
I might as well deal in the dog; 
 that way he can look at his own cards.

454
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,240
Studio teacher for Ninja Boy.

455
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,720
Stage twenty two.

456
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,240
Nice jacket.

457
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,720
Why didn't you call me and 
 tell me you were wearing that?

458
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
I didn't realize I had to call

459
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,720
and ask your permission before 
 I get dressed in the morning.

460
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,240
Oh, man, how embarrassing.

461
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,240
Let's hope David doesn't notice.

462
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,760
David.

463
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,240
Here's your coffee.

464
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,240
Your stir rod, sir.

465
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,240
David, may I speak to 
 you for a moment, please?

466
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,760
We've got to talk.

467
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Certainly, Susanne.

468
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,280
Kevin missed another session last night.

469
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,760
He didn't show up.

470
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Well, he had more 
 important things to do.

471
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
More important things?

472
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,800
David, he starts high school 
 the day this film finishes.

473
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,280
He's way behind.

474
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,800
He'll never be ready.

475
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,280
Everything will be fine.

476
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,280
David, if things don't change,

477
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,280
I'm going to take this to 
 the child labor board.

478
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,800
Susanne, Susanne, relax.

479
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,320
Don't worry, your pretty 
 little head about it.

480
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
I'll take care of everything...

481
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,800
myself.

482
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,320
Okay.

483
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
Thank you, David, I appreciate it.

484
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,320
Get rid of her.

485
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
I'm sorry, I thought it was mine.

486
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,360
Gentlemen.

487
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,360
Honorable investors.

488
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,360
The Ninja Boy lunch box.

489
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,840
And inside...

490
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,840
a free carton of ninja nectar.

491
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,840
Kosher, of course.

492
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,880
The newest sensation,

493
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,880
for next Halloween...

494
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,360
the Ninja Boy costume.

495
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,880
It actually makes you 
 feel like Ninja Boy.

496
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,360
Witness.

497
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,400
And now, for one of 
 my personal favorites.

498
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Edible Ninja Boy nunchucks.

499
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,920
Salted or unsalted.

500
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,920
And finally,

501
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,920
for a bit of marketing genius.

502
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,920
A toy every kid will want,

503
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,400
and every mother can use.

504
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,440
The Ninja Boy doll,

505
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,920
and meat tenderizer.

506
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,920
That's a nice cut of beef.

507
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,960
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Shlomo.

508
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,960
It'll come right out.

509
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,440
Twenty million in the film,

510
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,440
further ten million in development.

511
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,960
We're working on Ninja Boy cereal,

512
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,480
vitamin enriched puffed corn in 
 the shape of tiny Ninja Boys.

513
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,960
Then there's the Ninja Boy video game,

514
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,960
where you conquer world evil. 
 That sort of thing.

515
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,960
And finally, my favorite.

516
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,480
Ninja Boy tea.

517
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,000
Mr. Shlomo!

518
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,480
I'm so sorry, Mr. Shlomo!

519
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,480
My suit.

520
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,520
It's just a minor flesh 
 wound, you'll be alright.

521
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,000
You look great.

522
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
Stop it. Don't laugh.

523
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
They're the chosen people.

524
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,520
Stop.

525
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Kevin's doing great.

526
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,520
Yeah, he works with the tutor 
 four or five hours a day.

527
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,040
He's not missing a thing.

528
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,520
Not a thing.

529
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,520
Yeah, look,

530
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,040
hey, I'm your brother.

531
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,040
Would I let Kevin do 
 anything wrong? Huh?

532
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,040
You know?

533
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,040
He's doing great.

534
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,040
Buford!

535
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,560
It's long distance!

536
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,560
Bob, you okay?

537
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,040
Why are you breathing so heavy?

538
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,040
Buford! You're going to 
 have to pay for this call.

539
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,880
Buford!

540
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,040
Hello, Kevin.

541
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,080
Ms. Patterson, come in.

542
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,080
Don't worry, Kevin. 
 I'm not here for your lesson.

543
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
I'm...

544
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,080
I'm here to give you a farewell gift.

545
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
A farewell gift?

546
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,080
I was fired by the studio.

547
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,600
Why?

548
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,600
I'm a teacher, Kevin.

549
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,600
And I believe in what I do.

550
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,080
But sometimes when you believe 
 in something too strongly,

551
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,600
it gets you in trouble.

552
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,120
I guess I just pushed a little too 
 hard for something I believed in.

553
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,120
Now when you get dressed 
 on your first day of school,

554
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,120
And right before you walk out that door,

555
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,600
you open this gift.

556
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
Good bye.

557
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,640
President Lincoln changed 
 everything with it.

558
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,120
Because it said that never again can 
 one person own another person.

559
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,160
That's why the emancipation 
 proclamation's so important.

560
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,160
Thank you, Kevin.

561
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,160
You know, when I bought this phone,

562
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
they said it was water proof, 
 interference proof,

563
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,680
but never never did they 
 mention slobber proof.

564
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,680
So, what about Susanne?

565
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,680
Kevin, these guys make millions of dollars.

566
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,200
They know what they're doing.

567
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,680
If they fired Susanne I'm sure 
 there was a good reason.

568
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,680
What do you think? The studio 
 doesn't want you to learn?

569
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,680
Don't be ridiculous.

570
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,200
David cares about you. 
 He likes you.

571
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,200
What's on the menu for lunch, boys?

572
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,200
Is it chicken chop suey?

573
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,240
Or corn beef hash?

574
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,240
What's it going to be, Ninja Boy?

575
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,320
And cut.

576
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Cut! Cut!

577
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,840
Go find out what's going on, will you?

578
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,840
Move.

579
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,840
I'm a little concerned about his future.

580
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,840
We love doing the movies.

581
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,840
Okay, here's your pastrami 
 chili cheeseburger,

582
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,840
extra mayo, a side order 
 of chili cheese fries.

583
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,360
And your tofu salad.

584
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,360
Oh, here's your chili cheese things,

585
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,880
and your salad, and your straw.

586
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,360
Oh, thank you.

587
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,880
See, David,

588
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,880
what I'm saying is that,

589
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,360
if Kevin does the sequel right away,

590
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,880
then he'll miss the entire 
 spring semester.

591
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,880
Do you know what I mean?

592
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,880
Correct me if I'm wrong, Bob.

593
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,400
But prior to Kevin,

594
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,880
didn't you book clowns 
 for birthday parties?

595
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,880
Well, they weren't exactly clowns.

596
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,400
Clowns, Bob, saps in big shoes.

597
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,920
They were clowns.

598
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,400
Not a large vision.

599
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,400
In the contract,

600
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,400
it says that you were going to 
 give Kevin time off to go to school,

601
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,400
and then we'd do the sequel.

602
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,440
Yes, the contract also 
 stipulates that you,

603
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:08,920
will support our investments 
 in Kevin in good faith, Bob.

604
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,440
Now if you want to break your 
 part of the contract, fine.

605
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,440
Simply return the hundred 
 thousand dollars,

606
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,440
the cadillac, and the house 
 that we leased for you.

607
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,440
You're riding some...

608
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,960
...very lucrative coat tails.

609
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,440
Such a tragedy to fall off.

610
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,960
Time is like salt, Bob.

611
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,480
Don't let it run out on you.

612
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,480
It's a good thing time 
 isn't like ketchup.

613
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,000
I've got a meeting.

614
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,480
Take care of this, will you?

615
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,480
I'll get the next one.

616
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,000
Good boy.

617
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
The magic of motion pictures!

618
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Bobby! Looking good guy.

619
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,520
We are truly privileged, you and I.

620
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,520
But I was supposed to go to school.

621
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,520
I mean we were going to do the 
 sequel in the summer, right?

622
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,520
Yes, I spoke to Uncle Bob about that,

623
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,520
he agrees.

624
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,040
School can wait.

625
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,040
Can I be perfectly 
 Frank with you, Kevin?

626
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,560
I want to make you King of the Ninjas.

627
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,040
King! 
 Do you realize what that means?

628
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,560
Elvis?

629
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,040
Elvis and Kevin.

630
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,560
Yes, you see it's all part 
 of my master plan for you.

631
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,560
A vision if you will.

632
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,560
A very large and very expensive vision.

633
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,560
Is that why you fired Susanne?

634
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,080
She wasn't part of your master plan?

635
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,080
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

636
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,080
You're fourteen years old.

637
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,560
Do you have any idea 
 how many fourteen years olds

638
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,080
would like to trade places with you?

639
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,600
Right now?

640
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,080
You're living a dream, Kevin.

641
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,600
I know that if I were in your shoes,

642
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,080
I wouldn't want to wake up.

643
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,120
Knowledge is power, Francis Bacon.

644
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,120
One of my favorite quotes.

645
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,120
And what I think of when 
 I think of you.

646
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,640
Have a great first day at school.

647
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,120
Love, your teacher Susanne Patterson.

648
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,160
Hey, buddy, great news.

649
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,160
They're going to do the 
 sequel right away.

650
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,680
It's called "Frozen Ninja Boy".

651
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,160
We shoot it in Alaska.

652
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,680
And you take on a band 
 of killer eskimos.

653
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,680
How come you didn't stand up for me?

654
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,680
What are you talking about?

655
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,680
I was supposed to go to school.

656
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,200
You are going to go to school.

657
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,200
It's just going to be later. 
 That's all.

658
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,200
Hey, I thought we'd have 
 pizza tonight, huh?

659
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,680
I mean you were the one who was 
 supposed to take care of me.

660
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,200
All you care about is this 
 dumb house and your stupid car.

661
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,200
Hey, I care about you.

662
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,720
That's why I want you to do the sequel.

663
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,200
You don't care about me.

664
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,200
It's all a pack of lies, and 
 you're the biggest lie of all!

665
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,200
Hey, stop it!

666
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,720
Don't you talk to me like that.

667
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,200
You're fourteen how dare you?

668
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,720
Why not?

669
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,240
I mean everybody else does.

670
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,720
They laugh at you, Uncle Bob. 
 You're a big joke to them.

671
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,240
Nobody respects you.

672
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,720
You know cut it out!

673
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,720
I don't want to hear anymore from you.

674
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,240
Mr. Big Shot!

675
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,240
Mr. Movie Star!

676
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,760
Well, I've got news for you, Ninja Boy.

677
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,240
They laugh behind your back too.

678
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,760
Kevin.

679
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,280
We'll do the sequel, okay?

680
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,760
Everything's going to be great.

681
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,760
No, it won't be okay!

682
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,280
No one cares about you, Uncle Bob,

683
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,280
and no one cares about me!

684
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,760
I mean I'm not Ninja Boy.

685
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,800
I'm a ninja.

686
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,280
And to a ninja,

687
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,280
knowledge is a part of my power.

688
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,800
Kevin, you don't understand.

689
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,840
Kevin!

690
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,320
Kevin!

691
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,400
Buford.

692
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,880
Where's Kevin?

693
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,480
Ah! The late Mr. Ryan.

694
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Where is he, Bob?

695
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Kevin's not here?

696
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,000
Twenty million dollars.

697
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,520
That's four hundred and 
 forty four thousand,

698
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,520
four hundred and forty 
 four dollars a day.

699
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,520
Thirty seven thousand and 
 thirty seven dollars an hour.

700
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:33,520
Six hundred and seventeen dollars 
 and twenty eight cents a minute.

701
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:38,040
What the hell have you 
 done with the kid Ryan?

702
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,520
Nothing!

703
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,040
I thought he'd be here.

704
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,040
I swear I don't know where he is.

705
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,560
Luther!

706
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,560
Yeah?

707
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,040
Is he lying?

708
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,560
Hold this.

709
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,600
You know, I'm not quite sure.

710
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,600
You have twenty four hours

711
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,600
to find him.

712
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,600
And bring him back.

713
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,600
I don't know where he is.

714
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,080
Then I suggest Uncle Bob...

715
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,600
You start looking.

716
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,120
You took a bite out of 
 this, didn't you?

717
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,160
Kevin.

718
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,160
Kevin.

719
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,680
Hi.

720
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,430
Hi.

721
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,200
Hold on a minute, Karen.

722
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,200
Is this where Ms. Patterson lives?

723
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,200
Umm, yeah, she's in the back.

724
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:49,720
Who are you?

725
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:50,720
Oh, I'm...

726
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,720
Kevin Ryan.

727
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,720
Like I said she's in the back.

728
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,720
You can go back there if you want.

729
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,240
Thanks.

730
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,240
Karen, you won't believe who 
 just walked into my house.

731
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,720
No. You give up?

732
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,760
Ninja Boy.

733
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,760
I'm serious. I wouldn't lie 
 about something about that.

734
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,240
No, I'm going to go. I have to 
 change into my bathing suite.

735
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,760
No, you can't come over.

736
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,760
No, you'll make him feel uncomfortable.

737
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,240
You'll stare.

738
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,280
Oh, yes, you always stare.

739
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,760
Remember the time you 
 were five years old

740
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,760
and you stared at 
 Jimmy Henson until he cried.

741
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,280
No. No. No. 
 Okay, I'll call you back tomorrow.

742
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,280
All right, 
 I'll call you in thirty minutes.

743
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,280
Bye.

744
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,280
Mom.

745
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,800
Mom!

746
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,800
All right, they always say 
 two heads are better than one.

747
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,280
So we've got to put our 
 heads together and stay calm.

748
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,800
Now think.

749
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,800
If you were, Kevin, 
 where would you be?

750
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,800
You are no help.

751
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,320
There you go.

752
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,320
Kevin, want a hamburger?

753
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,840
Thank you, Ms. Patterson.

754
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,320
Maggie, give me your plate.

755
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:17,840
Here you go.

756
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,320
Eddie.

757
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,840
You'll have to excuse 
 my little brother.

758
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,840
He just escaped from the institution.

759
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,840
Na na...

760
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,840
Maggie!

761
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,840
Eddie, take some water.

762
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,360
Whoa! Are you hungry?

763
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,880
Do you want another 
 hamburger, Kevin?

764
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,360
Sure.

765
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,880
I have to talk to him about his room.

766
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,920
Really cool bathing suit, Kevin.

767
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,400
Well, you know, it was either this or

768
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,920
your little brother's Superman trunks.

769
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,920
What is it, too cold for Ninja Boy?

770
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,400
Too cold?

771
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,440
Too cold?

772
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,920
It's never too cold for Ninja Boy.

773
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,440
Quit stalling get in the pool.

774
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,920
Quit stalling.

775
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,440
It's too cold.

776
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,960
Okay, Buford, pick up the scent,

777
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,440
pick up the scent, Buford.

778
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,960
Okay, pick up the scent.

779
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,960
Wow, I saw it on Lassie once but...

780
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,480
his nose was much bigger than yours.

781
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,000
You should be ashamed of yourself.

782
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,480
My parents are back in Michigan.

783
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,000
I live with my uncle.

784
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,480
That's really sad.

785
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,480
I mean you must really miss them.

786
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Yeah, sometimes I do get a little lonely.

787
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,520
Oh, come on.

788
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,520
A big movie star like you.

789
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,000
You must have a million 
 girls chasing after you.

790
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,520
No, I don't.

791
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,000
Oh, please. 
 You must go on a date every night.

792
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,520
Well, the truth is I haven't 
 been on a date since,

793
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,520
well, you know since,

794
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,040
actually I've never been on a date.

795
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,040
Then you probably have no 
 idea how to ask a girl out, do you?

796
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,520
Of course I do.

797
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,040
Prove it. Show me 
 how you'd ask me out.

798
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,560
Would you like to go 
 out with me sometime?

799
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,040
Oh, come on, you know what I mean.

800
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,040
No. No. No. 
 You have to do it like this.

801
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,560
Maggie... would you go 
 out with me tomorrow?

802
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,560
Come on, do it just like that.

803
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,560
Maggie... would you go 
 out with me tomorrow?

804
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,080
I thought you'd never ask.

805
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,600
He's out there somewhere.

806
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,600
It's simple.

807
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,080
I just got to look for him.

808
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,600
Boy, Kevin, 
 those are really cool pajamas.

809
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,600
Here I brought you some towels.

810
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,120
Oh, thanks.

811
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,120
You know, next time I spend 
 the night over someone's house...

812
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,120
I'm going to remember 
 to pack some clothes.

813
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,640
Kevin, you've been here since 
 four o'clock this afternoon.

814
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,120
Yeah, it's been real great too.

815
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,120
I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.

816
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,640
Kevin, don't you think you 
 should let your uncle know

817
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,120
that you're staying over?

818
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,640
Oh, it's cool.

819
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,120
Kevin.

820
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,640
Ms. Patterson, Uncle Bob 
 doesn't care what I do.

821
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,160
I mean he's probably out 
 playing poker somewhere anyway.

822
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,160
Kevin...

823
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,640
I've seen the way your uncle 
 looks when he's watching you.

824
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,160
Believe me, he cares about you.

825
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,160
He loves you.

826
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,160
Maybe I'll give him a call tomorrow.

827
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,160
Kevin, I know something's wrong.

828
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,680
Do you want to talk about it?

829
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,680
Maybe tomorrow okay.

830
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,680
I mean right now I'm just 
 having the time of my life.

831
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,160
I don't want to ruin it.

832
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,280
Hey, darling, you looking 
 for a good time.

833
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,280
Actually I'm looing for a young boy.

834
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,280
Well, young girls are a lot more fun.

835
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,280
I don't want a young girl. 
 I want my nephew.

836
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,800
That sick.

837
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,800
Can you believe another one 
 of these guys wants a little boy.

838
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,800
Hi, Jack.

839
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,800
Bob, what are you doing here?

840
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,320
I need you your help.

841
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,840
I can't find my nephew. Kevin.

842
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,840
I've looked everywhere for him.

843
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,840
He's not here.

844
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:34,320
I know. But I was wondering 
 if you could help me look for him.

845
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,320
[ voice from inside the house ] 
 What's taking so long?

846
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,840
You guys will do anything to keep 
 from putting money in the pot.

847
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,840
What's going on you guys 
 are playing cards.

848
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,360
Well, not exactly cards.

849
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,840
Then what?

850
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,840
It's more like poker.

851
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,360
Poker?

852
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,840
Oh, come on, it's manny, it's manny.

853
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,360
You know how he is about the dog.

854
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,360
You have the dog here, do you?

855
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,360
Of course not, I don't have the dog.

856
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,880
Well...

857
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,360
why don't you come on in and play?

858
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,880
I can't I got to look for my nephew.

859
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,880
Wait...

860
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,400
We'll help you.

861
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,880
Really?

862
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,880
Yeah. We'll help you.

863
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,400
Thanks.

864
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,920
Luther.

865
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,920
Pour.

866
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,440
This is David.

867
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,160
I see.

868
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,480
Ninja Boy is still absent.

869
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:17,960
And my very expensive watch 
 tells me that Uncle Bob's

870
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:22,480
twenty four hours are up.

871
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,000
Luther.

872
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,480
Put down the water.

873
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
And handle it.

874
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,520
Okay.

875
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,520
Buford, haven't you ever 
 heard of mouthwash?

876
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,040
Buford...

877
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,520
Oh, God, where's Kevin?

878
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:08,560
Why am I always trying to have a 
 meaningful conversation with a dog?

879
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:27,560
what the!

880
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,600
Let me, Luther.

881
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,120
Move over!

882
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,600
Geek.

883
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,120
You go left.

884
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,640
And you go right.

885
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,640
If you ever want to see 
 your benji videos again,

886
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,640
you'll leave me alone.

887
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:34,640
Buford.

888
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,160
Buford. Buford.

889
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,160
Let's go. Let's go.

890
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,680
Let me tell you something, Buford,

891
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,160
the key is to keep low, okay?

892
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,160
They'll never notice us 
 if we keep low.

893
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,680
Keep low. Keep low.

894
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,680
No! Not that low. Come on.

895
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,680
Peek-a-boo!

896
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,200
Like mine.

897
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:10,720
What a pig.

898
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,720
Buford, come on!

899
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,720
Buford! Look at me!

900
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:18,200
Wipe that dumb expression 
 off your face.

901
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,200
We're talking a serious death here!

902
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,720
Buford, get off me.

903
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,240
Wait! Oh, not there. Not there.

904
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,240
Oh, Buford! The neighbors 
 are going to talk.

905
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,470
Oh!

906
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,720
It's me.

907
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,760
Some gum.

908
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,240
Hey! Has anybody got any change?

909
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,240
Fetch!

910
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,760
Fetch, Buford!

911
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,240
Buford, fetch!

912
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,280
Buford.

913
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,280
If you don't get your droopy 
 eyed, frying pan smashed face,

914
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,280
tailless butt out of here,

915
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,280
there's going to be 
 no more teddy grahams.

916
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,760
That's right! 
 No more teddy grahams ever.

917
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,760
Cinnamon or regular flavored.

918
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,510
Go!

919
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,280
I knew he's fold.

920
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,800
These are good.

921
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,800
I really miss those days when 
 we used to terrorize small towns.

922
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,360
I'm really glad you asked me out.

923
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,360
Look, I won.

924
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:35,400
I wonder what it feels like 
 to be crushed by a Harley?

925
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,920
Alright, think positive. 
 Think positive.

926
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,400
Don't panic. Don't panic.

927
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,400
Panic!

928
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,440
Your turn.

929
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,480
No. No. No. No. No.

930
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,000
What?

931
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
You're doing it all wrong.

932
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,480
I mean you're batting like a girl.

933
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:40,480
That's because I am a girl.

934
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I hope you've noticed.

935
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,480
Yeah, that was the first 
 thing I did notice.

936
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:57,520
- There you go! 
 - Okay.

937
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,000
I got it.

938
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,520
Now you're on your own.

939
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,520
Okay, I got it.

940
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,040
Okay.

941
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,560
They're multiplying.

942
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,560
Amoebas on Harleys.

943
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,080
I'm going to be killed by things 
 that reproduce a sexually.

944
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,120
A heart transplant from a 
 baboon that didn't take.

945
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,600
That's how I thought I'd go.

946
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,120
But never this way! Never.

947
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:26,720
I...

948
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,200
suppose you want to see my license?

949
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,720
Actually, Officer,

950
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,200
this wasn't entirely my fault.

951
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,200
It was...

952
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,720
lots of mean looking guys,

953
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,240
and lots of hair.

954
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,240
And they smelled pretty bad too.

955
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:46,720
Come on.

956
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,720
Once a ninja, always a ninja, right?

957
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,240
I broke the code.

958
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,760
I mean I used the ways of the 
 ninja to hurt someone I love.

959
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,240
I hit Uncle Bob.

960
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,760
So what are you going to do now?

961
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,240
Wait.

962
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,760
Practice.

963
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,240
Have faith.

964
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:07,760
The time will come when 
 I can make it right again.

965
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,760
I just hope I don't have 
 to wait until I'm real old.

966
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,760
Like twenty or something.

967
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,320
It's been nice guys.

968
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,800
See you on America's most wanted.

969
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,840
Lock me back up! Please!

970
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,840
I love this man like a brother.

971
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,320
Nobody hurt you in there, did they?

972
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,360
Oh, I love this song!

973
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:16,360
Mr. Ryan, can I interest you in a dance?

974
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,840
Right here? Right now?

975
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,880
What? You've never danced 
 on the thirteenth green?

976
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:23,880
It's an old irish tradition.

977
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,360
Well, in that case.

978
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,360
I throw away my lucky charms,

979
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,880
and offer you to a dance.

980
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,880
# Right here with me tonight #

981
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,880
# Is a love and my arms are 
 going to hold on tight #

982
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,880
# And I hope you'll hold on tight #

983
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,400
# Hold on tight to me #

984
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,400
# Gonna tell you why #

985
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:54,920
# The man in the moon #

986
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,920
# Is shining #

987
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,400
# On us #

988
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,400
# Tonight #

989
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,920
# Forever #

990
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,920
# We'll lift our hearts to the stars #

991
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,920
# Where they'll burn forever #

992
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,960
You've got to understand,

993
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,440
I really like you guys. I really do.

994
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,440
Those studio guys,

995
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:24,960
they're not as nice as me.

996
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,440
I mean they play for keeps.

997
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,960
Kevin's got to do this movie.

998
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,960
What?

999
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,480
What did you say?

1000
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,480
I was trying to tell you 
 not to rip the tape off.

1001
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,960
Come on, Luther. Untie me, 
 I'm not going anywhere.

1002
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:48,960
Promise?

1003
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,000
You can run faster than me.

1004
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,480
Okay.

1005
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:04,000
Okay, this is going to hurt me 
 more than it's going to hurt you.

1006
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Crybaby.

1007
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,520
Luther.

1008
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,520
Kevin's history book.

1009
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
I didn't read it.

1010
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,520
Wait a second.

1011
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,520
When did that happen?

1012
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,040
I'm out of touch.

1013
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,560
I'll take this home with me.

1014
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,560
How about a soda?

1015
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,560
Sure.

1016
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,600
Here you go.

1017
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,080
Take them I don't want them anymore.

1018
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,600
Oh, my God.

1019
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,120
Maggie, wait.

1020
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,120
Maggie, wait.

1021
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,120
Mr. innocent.

1022
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,600
You told me you had never dated before.

1023
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,120
It wasn't a date.

1024
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,120
Venus Vows To Make Ninja Boy Ninja Man!

1025
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,600
Oh, give me a break!

1026
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,120
Come on!

1027
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,120
You don't believe all 
 that stuff, do you?

1028
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,640
Do you? 
 I mean the studio set that up.

1029
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:43,120
So why do you look like you're 
 enjoying yourself so much?

1030
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,120
Maggie, stop!

1031
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,640
What do you want?

1032
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,640
Maggie...

1033
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,640
today was the best day of my life.

1034
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,160
All that other stuff.

1035
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,640
It's phony.

1036
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,160
You and I.

1037
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,160
We're real.

1038
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,640
That picture.

1039
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,160
You saw everything 
 I've been running from.

1040
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:11,680
You've just got to believe me.

1041
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,680
Boy, you look silly with all those animals.

1042
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,680
Will you stop.

1043
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,680
What am I a chimpanzee?

1044
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,680
You're grooming me. What is this?

1045
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,200
Oh, settle down.

1046
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,200
Want to watch a little TV?

1047
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,200
I can't believe I won all these things.

1048
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,200
Oh, Kevin.

1049
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:45,200
Uncle Bob, what are you doing here?

1050
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,720
I'll be right back, okay, sweetie.

1051
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,720
I'll be right back.

1052
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,720
Okay. Don't be long.

1053
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,720
Kevin...

1054
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,720
I was wrong.

1055
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:01,240
We're going to do the sequel 
 like we originally planned.

1056
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,240
You're going back to school.

1057
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,760
Your uncle and I have been talking.

1058
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,240
For real, Uncle Bob?

1059
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,240
For real, Kevin.

1060
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:29,280
Ma'am, could I bother you for a tissue?

1061
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:35,800
Luther.

1062
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,280
Yeah.

1063
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,800
Remember the first time 
 you were in love?

1064
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:41,800
Ah...

1065
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,280
Ah-ah...

1066
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:48,800
It's okay, Luther.

1067
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,800
Store it in your memory 
 and I'll ask you later.

1068
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:52,800
Okay.

1069
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,800
You know we really 
 got to go something.

1070
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,320
Robby has the meter running.

1071
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,320
It's costing me a fortune.

1072
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:58,320
Really?

1073
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,800
Can you get them?

1074
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:00,800
Excuse me.

1075
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,320
Excuse me.

1076
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,840
Get your butt over here!

1077
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,320
Okay, let's go.

1078
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,320
Those are our terms, David.

1079
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:19,840
Take it or leave it.

1080
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,840
I admire your integrity.

1081
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,360
We'll do it your way.

1082
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,840
Finish school, Kevin...

1083
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:29,360
We'll do "Frozen Ninja Boy" 
 in the summer.

1084
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,360
Really?

1085
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,360
I mean I'm glad you 
 saw it my way, David.

1086
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,880
Robin.

1087
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,360
Take Kevin down to makeup,

1088
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,880
we have a movie to finish.

1089
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,880
Okay...

1090
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,360
let's go to makeup.

1091
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,880
Help me up, Kevin.

1092
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,880
I always stick to leather, okay.

1093
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:02,400
"Frozen Ninja Boy", 
 goes ahead on schedule.

1094
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,400
Find me a new Ninja Boy.

1095
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,400
Umm...

1096
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,400
we have a problem, David.

1097
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,400
Oh?

1098
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:14,400
Kevin and Bob Ryan own 
 the Ninja Boy character.

1099
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,920
Are you telling me that

1100
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:21,440
that clown agent outfoxed 
 our attorneys?

1101
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:22,920
I'm afraid so.

1102
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,440
Oh, my.

1103
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:28,440
I think I maybe getting angry.

1104
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,440
[ chanting ]

1105
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,960
Okay. Here's what we do.

1106
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:40,960
Get what's his name,

1107
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,960
the director on the phone.

1108
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,440
We have some creative 
 decisions to make here.

1109
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,960
If I can't have Ninja Boy,

1110
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:53,960
nobody will.

1111
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,480
Hey, thanks.

1112
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,480
You got to be kidding.

1113
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:04,000
You want me to kill off 
 the Ninja Boy character.

1114
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,000
I can't do that.

1115
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,480
David. That will change the 
 whole end of the picture.

1116
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,000
I can't do that.

1117
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:10,480
You can't kill off the Ninja Boy.

1118
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
He's the hero of the film.

1119
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,480
No, I won't do that, David.

1120
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,000
It compromises my integrity.

1121
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:20,520
And besides I happen to have 
 a contract for the sequel.

1122
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,000
Two pictures.

1123
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,520
Michelle Pfieffer?

1124
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,520
Yeah, kill the kid, you know, 
 I never liked that Ninja Boy.

1125
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
He's out.

1126
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,040
[ director speaking ] Okay, 
 just a couple of minor changes.

1127
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:39,040
No matter happens,

1128
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,520
I want you to wing it.

1129
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,520
I want this to be spontaneous.

1130
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,520
Okay?

1131
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,520
Sure, I'll try.

1132
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,040
That's my Ninja Boy.

1133
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,040
Kevin.

1134
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,520
No matter what happens,

1135
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,040
just make it spontaneous. 
 And keep going. Okay?

1136
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,560
Okay.

1137
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,040
Okay, here we go. Are we all set?

1138
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:59,560
Kevin takes everybody down 
 but the killer. Let's go.

Say goodbye, Ninja Boy.

Cut! Cut!

Who are these people?

What did you do?

1148
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:58,120
I didn't do it.

1149
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,120
He was going to shoot me?

1150
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,640
He wasn't going to shoot you.

1151
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,640
He was going to shoot Ninja Boy. 
 Ain't that right, David?

1152
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:07,640
Get off this set,

1153
