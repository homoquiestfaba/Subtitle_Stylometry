How can you trust a jury?

2045
01:21:08,944 --> 01:21:10,536
A jury is made up
of 1 2 people

2046
01:21:10,612 --> 01:21:12,204
too stupid to get out
of jury duty.

2047
01:21:12,281 --> 01:21:14,215
Oh , Colin .

2048
01:21:14,283 --> 01:21:16,308
That's old , man .
Really old .

2049
01:21:16,385 --> 01:21:18,649
lt's old now, but maybe
he's the one that wrote it.

2050
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:19,982
No.

2051
01:21:20,055 --> 01:21:21,920
How old is it?

2052
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:24,686
The '50s.
