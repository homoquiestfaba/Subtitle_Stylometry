1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,171
[dog barking]

2
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:10,375
[wind blowing]

3
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:22,854
There it is, boys.

4
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,424
The Whaley House.

5
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:28,560
Ah, I thought
it'd be bigger.

6
00:00:28,627 --> 00:00:30,862
It's big enough
for ghosts.

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,230
You know what?

8
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,366
Everything
compared to you
is small, meathouse.

9
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,302
You guys know this place
used to be a morgue?

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,970
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

11
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,638
No, dead serious.
Wow.

12
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:43,375
That's one
of the reasons why it's
so frigging haunted.

13
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:46,578
And the fact that,
you know, so many
people died here.

14
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:47,446
That helps.

15
00:00:47,513 --> 00:00:49,081
Well, um,
I've seen enough.

16
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:50,549
I think
we should get back

17
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:52,784
before your sister
finds out we're
gone, Casey.

18
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:53,585
Go back?
Yeah.

19
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:55,587
But we have
to go in first.

20
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:57,722
Besides, she's busy
porking shit-ass Steve.

21
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,224
We have plenty of time.

22
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,159
But the house
is locked, Casey.

23
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,562
And I forgot
my inhaler.
I need it.

24
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:04,829
Breathing's
for gays, dude.

25
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:06,098
Besides...

26
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:08,433
I just so happen
to have the key.

27
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,168
Wait. Is that
one of those rocks

28
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,336
with the key
hidden inside,

29
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,737
you know,
the hideaway rock?

30
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:15,039
Is it a hideaway rock?
No, it's a regular rock.

31
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,142
I throw it.
We get in.

32
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,444
No, that's vandalism, dude.

33
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:20,878
Get Simon to do it.

34
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:22,147
Fuck you, fat boy.

35
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,548
Okay, come on, guys.

36
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:26,951
We've walked all this way.
We gotta see inside.

37
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:30,155
Then let's
come back and take
the damn tour.

38
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,324
We can get
some souvenirs
and shit.

39
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:34,326
You know we don't
have any money.

40
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:36,694
Okay, man.

41
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:39,164
If you throw
that rock in there

42
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,432
and you do something

43
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,135
and piss off
all the ghosts,
then what?

44
00:01:43,202 --> 00:01:44,569
Mm-hmm.
Then we see 'em,

45
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:47,172
and that's exactly
what we came here for.

46
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,640
Oh, my god.

47
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,009
You know what? Uh...

48
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:52,244
You do this,
meathouse.

49
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:54,045
Your arms
are fatter than mine.

50
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:55,580
It's muscle,
cancer tooth,

51
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:59,050
and I'm not going
to jail for some
stupid-ass ghosts.

52
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:01,620
[laughing]
Dumb-ass.

53
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,222
[wind blows]

54
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,524
Don't look at me.

55
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:07,292
I'm not
about to do it.

56
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,493
I'd rather be
at home

57
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,529
watching the rest of
the fulci marathon.

58
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:12,364
Fulci is
an artistic abortion.

59
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:14,699
Argento is
the way to go, man.

60
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:15,833
Shut up,

61
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:18,036
you fat Louie
Anderson looking
motherfucker.

62
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:19,404
Okay, fine. I'll do it.

63
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,406
I guess it's
a man's job anyway.

64
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,708
Wouldn't want
one of you ladies
to break a nail.

65
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,378
Hey, that was
only one time.

66
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:29,614
[glass breaks]

67
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,115
Now what?

68
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,784
Now...

69
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:34,786
I get a few shots.

70
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:38,290
And then...

71
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,026
What?

72
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:52,003
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

73
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,438
[horn honks]
Aah!

74
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,839
Fuck.
[crash]

75
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:56,841
[music playing]

76
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,040
[camera clicks]

77
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,718
Welcome, everyone,

78
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,987
to America's
Most Haunted House.

79
00:04:16,054 --> 00:04:18,956
If you're all ready,
we'll get started.

80
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:19,991
Right this way.

81
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:43,815
Here we are
in the piano room.

82
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:46,451
When Thomas and Anna Whaley
first built the house,

83
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,688
they planned to run
part of it as a business,

84
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:51,923
which was in this room.

85
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,626
It was called Whaley
and Crosthwaite's
general store.

86
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,594
His partner,
Philip Crosthwaite,

87
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:59,331
was once the Deputy Sheriff
of San Diego,

88
00:04:59,398 --> 00:05:01,132
and it just so happens

89
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,335
that he was the man
who tightened the noose

90
00:05:03,402 --> 00:05:05,069
around
Yankee Jim Robinson's neck,

91
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:09,874
who was hanged here
when the public gallows
occupied the grounds...

92
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,175
Allegedly.

93
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:19,217
Right this way, everyone.

94
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,557
The Whaley house
was also the site

95
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:28,660
of the first commercial
theater in all of San Diego.

96
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,562
The ghost of a little girl

97
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:32,930
has been seen in here
on several occasions.

98
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:34,899
Nobody really knows
who she is.

99
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,635
Some think that she's
the great-granddaughter
of Thomas Whaley,

100
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:39,871
but it's still a mystery.

101
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,543
W-whoa. Did--
Did you see that?

102
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,216
Never mind.

103
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:56,721
Anyway, let's continue on,
everyone.

104
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,122
Now...

105
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,391
I have been asked

106
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,860
if I've ever
seen anything before,

107
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:05,229
and the answer to that is...

108
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:06,330
No.

109
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,766
Actually,
to be quite honest,

110
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,502
I am pretty skeptical
of the whole thing.

111
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:12,937
Now, I'm not saying that

112
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,773
I don't believe in ghosts
[creaking]

113
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,542
I just haven't been
convinced either way.

114
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,910
[creaking]

115
00:06:18,977 --> 00:06:20,879
I'm sorry,
but I don't know

116
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:24,148
how you don't
believe this house
isn't haunted.

117
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:25,517
Excuse me?

118
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:30,422
I've been seeing things
for the past 20 minutes.

119
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:32,524
Am I alone here?

120
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,861
You're kidding.
You're kidding.

121
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,863
This house
is haunted as fuck.

122
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,598
Well, what have
you seen?

123
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,033
Maybe you've just
mistaken something.

124
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,035
No. No, I haven't
mistaken anything.

125
00:06:44,102 --> 00:06:46,070
I've been seeing
ghosts and...

126
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:48,139
[coughing]

127
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:49,407
Are you okay?

128
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,208
Get her some water,
please.

129
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:53,678
[gagging]

130
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,985
Somebody call 911!

131
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,757
I need you to...

132
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:13,164
[dispatch chatter]

133
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:29,013
Whoa. Sorry.

134
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,047
Hey, Bobo.

135
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,686
You okay, kiddo?

136
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:36,654
Yeah.
Yeah, it just...

137
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,222
[siren blaring]

138
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,024
Kinda stunk.

139
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,325
No kidding.

140
00:07:41,393 --> 00:07:43,895
But you were great,
though.

141
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,129
Thanks.

142
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,135
It happens
all the time.

143
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:52,504
Really?

144
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:53,972
Believe it or not,

145
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:57,174
someone has
a reaction
to this house,

146
00:07:57,242 --> 00:08:01,012
and they have
to be wheeled away
to the hospital.

147
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,446
Why?

148
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,716
Well, it's
this damn house.

149
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:07,251
It does things
to people.

150
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,056
You've been here,
what, dear,

151
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,157
four months?

152
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,627
I-I've been
working here
over 30 years.

153
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:19,363
Trust me.
I know how to deal
with this house.

154
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:20,899
How to deal with it?

155
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:24,168
Well, walk with me
while I close
the place up.

156
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:28,205
I don't think
we're going to be doing
any more tours today.

157
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:33,144
You know, Penny,

158
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:35,980
When I first started
working here,

159
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:40,151
my predecessor gave me
three rules
to live by,

160
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:44,388
and I think--
Think maybe it's time
I shared those with you.

161
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:45,623
[keys jingle]

162
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,159
[lock turns]

163
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,664
So rule number one,

164
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:54,465
don't call
the ghosts out.

165
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,833
They hate that.

166
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:57,902
Rule number two,

167
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,604
don't damage the house.

168
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,405
They're
very territorial.

169
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:03,841
And rule number three,

170
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:08,713
never, never go inside
the house at night.

171
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,514
That is their time,

172
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,117
reserved for them alone.

173
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,054
You know I don't
believe in ghosts, right?

174
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:19,057
Heh. I used to be
just like you, Penny,

175
00:09:19,124 --> 00:09:22,594
used to think it was all
a big tourist trap.

176
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:24,696
So what
changed your mind?

177
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,141
Just because you
don't believe in ghosts,

178
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:41,012
doesn't mean they
don't believe in you.

179
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,851
You know, Penny, dear,

180
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,987
you know who
you remind me of?

181
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:50,287
No. Who?

182
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:53,324
Did--did you ever wonder
why you ended up
working here,

183
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:56,327
despite the fact
that you don't
believe in ghosts?

184
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:58,963
Eh, ghosts had nothing
to do with it, okay?

185
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,464
I just lucked into it.

186
00:10:00,532 --> 00:10:03,901
I needed a job
to help pay my way
through med school,

187
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:05,637
and this is
where I ended up.

188
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:08,339
Hmm. Maybe it was
meant to be.

189
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:09,874
What was meant to be?

190
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,209
Oh, nothing. Just my--
my mind wandering.

191
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:14,679
Anyway, look,
you go on home now,

192
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,081
and I'll see you
tomorrow morning, okay?

193
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:23,154
[music playing]

194
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:32,563
Right. So that's
what I think is
the most crucial element.

195
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,298
My god.

196
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:35,867
I agree.

197
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:37,869
I mean, have you
actually seen

198
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:40,872
the nipples
on an indian woman?

199
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:43,074
Are we really
talking about this
right now?

200
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,175
Okay, honey,
please, please.

201
00:10:44,242 --> 00:10:45,543
The men are trying
to talk, so...

202
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,079
I think the width
and the girth
of the areola

203
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,648
are just as important
as the size
of the breast,

204
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,250
you know, adds majesty
to the bosom.

205
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:55,086
Definitely.
A fantastic set of nipples

206
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,688
can literally
define a woman.

207
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:58,289
Guys, will you
please shut up?

208
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:01,625
I think it goes back
to when we were babies.

209
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:05,396
Okay, I think
I know where we're
going with this,

210
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:08,833
so let's just, uh,
stop talking
about it.

211
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,235
Baby, I'm a scientist.

212
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,670
Please.

213
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:16,440
See, the thing is--
is we want to marry
our mothers.

214
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:17,441
What?!

215
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:21,645
And we
seek out nipples
that are similar

216
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,414
to the ones
that we suckled.

217
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:24,481
Ah, lord.

218
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:27,618
Penny's nips,
just like my mother's.

219
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:28,920
What?!
Shut up!

220
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:29,954
Ouch. Ouch.

221
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,223
You need me
to do that to you?

222
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,325
No, I'm--I'm good.
Okay. There you go.

223
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:36,794
Guys, can we change
the subject now?

224
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,462
Yes. Let's.

225
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,066
How was everyone's day?

226
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,802
Some tourist
freaked out
at the house today.

227
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,803
No shit?

228
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,772
Yeah. It was weird.

229
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,507
Freaked out how?

230
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:52,176
Started going
into seizures

231
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,112
and foaming
at the mouth.

232
00:11:57,415 --> 00:11:59,083
You're joking.

233
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,819
No. And apparently
it happens
all the time.

234
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,088
My boss blames it
on the house,

235
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,623
like it's poison
or something.

236
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,459
I don't know
how you can work
at that place.

237
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:09,827
It's not that bad.

238
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,095
Not that bad?

239
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,097
It's haunted
as fuck.

240
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,567
Well, if I ever
see anything,

241
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,269
I'll let you know,
Craig.

242
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:21,739
Yeah, but ghost shit,
it can't be real.

243
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,208
It just doesn't
make sense.

244
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,177
Well, just 'cause
we don't understand it,

245
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,712
I mean, it doesn't mean
it isn't real.

246
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,547
Right. I mean, it took 'em

247
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:33,417
a hell of a long time
to figure out gravity, right?

248
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:36,220
Actually,
I don't think
that's the case.

249
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,257
Okay, I mean,
millions of people

250
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:41,259
have experienced
the paranormal, okay?

251
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:44,762
Yet one witness
is enough to send someone
to death row.

252
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,165
I'd rather be
talking about nipples.

253
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:49,400
Look, ghosts are real,

254
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,769
and the Whaley house
is really haunted.

255
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,305
Why?
Because TV says so?

256
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:57,708
Are you saying
the TV lies to me?

257
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,711
Oh, no, no, no,
honey balls.

258
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,814
TV is your master.
Right.

259
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:05,582
All I'm saying
is that weird stuff
happens there,

260
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,585
but I just can't
buy that ghosts
are real.

261
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:10,054
It doesn't
make sense.

262
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,358
Penny, you work
in the mornings, right?

263
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,393
Sometimes.

264
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:19,096
Wait. Wait.

265
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:20,998
Craig, what are
you thinking?

266
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:24,435
So you open the doors,
and you lock up at night?

267
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:26,237
Sometimes.

268
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,406
Okay, now I don't
want to make an ass
out of you and me,

269
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:31,508
but is it safe
to assume that you have

270
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:33,677
a set of keys
to the Whaley house

271
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:35,813
or at least
access to them?

272
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,381
Yeah, but...

273
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,484
wait a minute.

274
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:42,486
Oh, my god. Craig.

275
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:45,456
Oh, that's such
a great idea.

276
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:47,225
No. No, it's not.

277
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:50,694
A private tour
of the most haunted house
in america.

278
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:52,096
What do you say, Penny?

279
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,298
Eh, wait. Wait, what--
No!

280
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,467
Guys,
I can get fired!

281
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:57,869
Mmm, please.

282
00:13:57,936 --> 00:14:00,938
Come on, sweetie.
What do you say?

283
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,940
We'll be
on our best
behavior.

284
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,142
Just--just a couple
of hours, pen.

285
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,044
I can call my cousin
and borrow some stuff.

286
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,347
He's like Q branch
for ghost hunters.

287
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:10,882
But, guys,
if anything breaks,

288
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:12,616
I'm liable,
and I need this job.

289
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:15,686
Oh, my god.
No one is going
to find out.

290
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,054
We'll be careful.

291
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:22,927
We're not doing this,
right?

292
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:26,730
God, first you drive us
to the set of thriller,
and then you want

293
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:28,966
to take us
to a haunted mansion?
What's wrong with you?

294
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,734
Ahem!

295
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:32,370
Hey, Penny...

296
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:35,639
You know, it's, um--

297
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:37,375
it's your call.

298
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:41,578
Pretty please?

299
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:48,485
Okay!
Yes!

300
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:51,389
But only for
a little bit,
all right?

301
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:53,391
Yes!

302
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,260
This is just
to prove to you guys

303
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,962
that there's
nothing there.

304
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,196
[line rings]

305
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:00,731
Just in and out.
What's going to hap--

306
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,666
Yeah, we'll just do
the old in-and-out.

307
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:04,802
Hey. Hey, Ray-Ray.

308
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:06,603
Guess what we're
doing tonight.

309
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,491
[gasps]

310
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,093
Oh, wow.

311
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:39,403
Oh, my god, you guys.

312
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,605
It smells so cool in here.

313
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,843
This place is
creepy as fuck.

314
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,012
It's just
an old house.

315
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,281
They say you could
hear the footsteps

316
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,017
of Thomas Whaley pacing
up in his bedroom.

317
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,253
Why are we
whispering?

318
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:57,721
[knock on door]
Ohh.

319
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,905
Are you Craig's...

320
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:18,075
cousin,
twice removed.

321
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,077
Hey!
Black-ass Ray!

322
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,178
White-ass Craig!

323
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,213
[both laugh]

324
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,415
This is dope
as shit, brother.

325
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,216
Yeah.

326
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:26,884
How did you
pull this off?

327
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:28,119
Penny.
She works here, man.

328
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:29,586
Well, I hope
you don't mind,

329
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:31,655
but I kind of
brought a friend.

330
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:33,424
Who?

331
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:38,262
[gasps]

332
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,531
Keith Drummand.

333
00:16:40,598 --> 00:16:43,234
At your service,
young friends.

334
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:47,271
[gasps] the famous
Keith Drummand?

335
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,839
The one and only,
young man.

336
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,408
The one and only.
Heh heh.

337
00:16:56,614 --> 00:17:01,552
World-famous,
if you don't mind.

338
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,760
Give me your hand.

339
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,775
You're an Aries.

340
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:27,878
Taurus, actually.

341
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,548
Oh. Really?

342
00:17:30,615 --> 00:17:32,516
Well...

343
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:35,386
someone here
is an Aries.

344
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:39,390
Ah!

345
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,392
There. You see?
Heh heh.

346
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:45,196
Now, enough chitchat.

347
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:48,799
Let me at
those darn ghosts.
[chuckles]

348
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:55,106
Who's Keith Drummand?

349
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:57,341
I thought it was
just gonna be us.

350
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,609
Heh. Are you serious?

351
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:00,377
He's a psychic.
He's been on, like,

352
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:01,945
every ghost-hunting show
on TV,

353
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:04,948
even that short-lived
crippled kid's one.

354
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:08,152
Let's go.

355
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,587
It's all right.

356
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:19,296
[exhales]

357
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:43,154
I'm here.

358
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:45,422
I heard you.

359
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,326
You called me back.

360
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:58,636
What do you want
from me?

361
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,080
Yes. Yes.

362
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:12,216
All right.

363
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,250
All right.

364
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,885
I--I--

365
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:31,435
You want this,

366
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,004
and I can
give it to you.

367
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:38,509
It'll help.

368
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,971
Ah! Be careful with
the floor, please.

369
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,608
As a matter of fact,
be careful with
everything, guys.

370
00:20:10,675 --> 00:20:11,875
Sorry.

371
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:15,078
You know what?
Here are some
ground rules, okay?

372
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:18,649
No touching
anything.

373
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,287
No taking anything.

374
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,088
No rifling
through papers

375
00:20:25,156 --> 00:20:26,923
or breathing
on anything, guys.

376
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:30,160
Come on. Everything
is really fragile.

377
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:32,296
Pen, pen, relax.

378
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,564
It's gonna
be fine.

379
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,099
Hey, what'd you bring me?

380
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:38,001
The works, baby.

381
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:39,002
Ooh.

382
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:43,974
First and foremost,

383
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,409
digital
voice recorder.

384
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:48,279
Oh, evp. Nice.

385
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:50,213
What's evp?

386
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,950
It's a fancy term
for recording
ghost voices on tape.

387
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:56,787
See, the recorder
picks up frequencies

388
00:20:56,854 --> 00:20:58,822
the human ear
can't detect,

389
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,125
so if they're talking,
we'll hear 'em.

390
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:04,561
Yeah, but does
that really work?

391
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:06,530
Google it.
You'll hear things

392
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,299
that'll turn
your asshole white.

393
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:09,866
Ha ha!

394
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:11,602
Laser thermometer.

395
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,671
You can measure
temperatures all over,

396
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:15,939
or you can spot-temp
with the laser.

397
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:18,141
Good for pointing out
cold spots.

398
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:24,581
And the pièce
de résistance...

399
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,484
The emf meter.
Motherfucker.

400
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,620
Emf?

401
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,155
Electricians
use 'em,

402
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:33,657
but ghost hunters
do, too.

403
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,559
It's a commonly held belief

404
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,961
that ghosts disrupt
the electromagnetic field,

405
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:41,598
so you can use these things
like metal detectors.

406
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:42,800
But for ghosts.

407
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:45,268
Right as rain.

408
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,304
You didn't bring
the full-spectrum
camera?

409
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:51,007
Dumb-ass Dave dropped it
on a tombstone
a few nights ago.

410
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:53,577
[sighs]
That sucks.

411
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,613
It's okay.
Shit-ass Steve
is gonna fix it.

412
00:21:57,615 --> 00:21:59,550
So what do
we do now?

413
00:21:59,617 --> 00:22:01,184
Just walk around,
or...

414
00:22:01,252 --> 00:22:05,656
We could, but I'd
like to try an oldie,
but goodie first.

415
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,992
What's that for?

416
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,973
Ah, there we are.

417
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,107
Heh heh.

418
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:29,012
[girl laughs]

419
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,517
Hello?

420
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:34,852
Who's there?

421
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,191
[clock ticking]

422
00:22:46,063 --> 00:22:48,465
Guys, we really
shouldn't be doing this.

423
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,734
Will you please
relax, Giselle?

424
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,335
No. I'm not doing this.

425
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,170
I'm not a part of this.

426
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,277
Okay, everyone.

427
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:02,178
One finger
lightly on top.

428
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,955
We are speaking
to the Whaley family

429
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:15,992
or any earthbound entity
in this house.

430
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:21,632
We would like
to communicate with you.

431
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:33,844
My finger's
starting to cramp up
a little already.

432
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,012
Yeah, I've heard that
before.

433
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,383
Hey, it's called
rheumatoid arthritis,
all right?

434
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,118
Guys,
we need to focus.

435
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:45,188
No. We need to get
the fuck out of here.

436
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:47,624
Penny, you work here.

437
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,660
Maybe you should
ask the question.

438
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:52,062
What should I ask?

439
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:54,130
I don't know.

440
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:56,099
Maybe something only
the ghost would know.

441
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:57,100
Yes or no questions.

442
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,136
Um...

443
00:24:01,372 --> 00:24:03,640
Okay.

444
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:08,612
Did Violet Whaley
die in this house?

445
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,149
Move the glass
if yes, spirit.

446
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:21,124
[gasping]

447
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,597
[laughs]

448
00:24:26,664 --> 00:24:27,898
That was Craig.

449
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,733
I swear to god
it wasn't me.

450
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,202
No, that was you, Craig.
I know it was.

451
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:35,005
No. I know you think
I'm lying 'cause I'm
an asshole,

452
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,040
but I swear to god
I didn't move that.

453
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:40,777
Ray: All right, guys,
fingers back on.

454
00:24:40,845 --> 00:24:42,913
We've got someone here.

455
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,790
You're on, Penny.

456
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:59,696
Okay, Violet died
in this house,

457
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:02,799
but did she shoot
herself here, too?

458
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,569
Move in a circle if no

459
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,871
and a straight line
if yes, spirit.

460
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,989
Did she shoot herself
in the head?

461
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:38,134
No.

462
00:25:39,236 --> 00:25:41,137
That's right.

463
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:43,707
She shot herself
in the heart.

464
00:25:44,642 --> 00:25:47,077
That's so sad. Why?

465
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:50,413
Um, her husband
abandoned her

466
00:25:50,481 --> 00:25:51,949
after two weeks
of marriage,

467
00:25:52,016 --> 00:25:54,417
so she went outside
and shot herself.

468
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,520
Thomas Whaley
heard the gunshot,

469
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:01,191
and he went out
and brought his daughter
in the house.

470
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,294
She died
in that chair.

471
00:26:04,361 --> 00:26:05,829
Of course she did.

472
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:13,103
Okay, guys,
I am getting

473
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,305
increasingly freaked
the fuck out here.

474
00:26:15,372 --> 00:26:17,440
We've got someone
hanging on here.

475
00:26:17,508 --> 00:26:18,842
Can we please focus?

476
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:31,354
Is this Violet Whaley?

477
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,728
Are you still there,
spirit?

478
00:26:39,697 --> 00:26:42,132
Are you a ghost?

479
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,702
Are you a moron?

480
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,404
I'm a little nervous
right now.

481
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,776
Are you still here?

482
00:26:56,313 --> 00:26:58,581
Oh.

483
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,783
Wow.

484
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,317
It likes you.

485
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:04,721
Ask it something else.

486
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,490
Um...

487
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:09,059
Are you a Whaley?

488
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,643
Okay. But which one?

489
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,078
All of them.

490
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,520
This place...

491
00:27:37,588 --> 00:27:39,389
This house...

492
00:27:39,456 --> 00:27:41,324
is interesting.

493
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,095
How so?

494
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,565
You know when you walk
into a darkened
movie theater

495
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:50,567
and it seems
empty because it--

496
00:27:50,634 --> 00:27:52,903
You can hardly
see anything?

497
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,740
But there are
other people there

498
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:01,377
watching you,
sitting in the dark.

499
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:04,881
That's how it feels.

500
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,918
I just need
to get adjusted
to the dark.

501
00:28:07,985 --> 00:28:09,686
You want to look around?

502
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,421
Yes. Yes.

503
00:28:11,488 --> 00:28:12,889
I think we should.

504
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,992
Is it okay?

505
00:28:20,664 --> 00:28:22,032
Fine.

506
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,102
"Fine"? Really?

507
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:28,571
'Cause this is
kind of crazy
right now, Penny.

508
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:30,941
30 minutes tops,
guys, okay?

509
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,245
I been looking forward
to this.

510
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,313
The Whaley house

511
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:38,381
has barred its doors

512
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:41,084
to paranormal
investigators
for years.

513
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:44,721
So tonight
I'll be the first one

514
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:47,224
to peek behind its veil.

515
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:50,260
[chuckles]

516
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:54,297
Quite a feather
in my cap,

517
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:57,067
don't you think?
[laughs]

518
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,774
You can wait here
alone if you want.

519
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:06,342
Well, shit, when you
put it like that...

520
00:29:24,695 --> 00:29:26,263
[woman sighs]
Yeah.

521
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,999
Well, I feel like
we're on the set
of thriller.

522
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:30,733
No, we're not.
We're at my job.

523
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,469
I thought
we were going out.
I had my hair done.

524
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:37,174
Of course we're going out,
but I got to take care
of something first.

525
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:38,441
This place
looks haunted.

526
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:39,442
Just a minute.

527
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,512
Puffy. Puffy.

528
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:44,047
Who's Puffy?

529
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,682
Come here, baby.

530
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:48,218
Come here, Puffy.

531
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,420
Is it a monster
or something?

532
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:55,091
Puffy,
look what papa got.

533
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:58,361
Look.

534
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,463
Puffy?

535
00:30:00,531 --> 00:30:01,698
Hot chick. Big tits.

536
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:05,368
Can we go have sushi
at a nice restaurant
now?

537
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,137
Yeah, in a minute.

538
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:09,472
Really?

539
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,976
Baby? Puff?

540
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:15,846
[sighs] all right,
I'm just gonna go
before I get murdered.

541
00:30:15,913 --> 00:30:18,681
Babe, hold on.

542
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:21,084
Babe.

543
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,853
Hey, babes,
where'd you go?

544
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,021
Babe.

545
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,724
Come on, now. We--
we getting ready to go.

546
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:29,292
You just wait a second.

547
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:32,329
[woman crying softly]

548
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:35,531
Hello?

549
00:30:37,935 --> 00:30:39,569
Who's there?

550
00:30:39,636 --> 00:30:42,105
[crying continues]
who's out there?

551
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:45,641
Bobo: I can't see you.

552
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,544
Are you hurt?

553
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,781
Oh, fuck that shit!

554
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,483
[groaning]

555
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:15,705
[lapping]

556
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,277
[meows]

557
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,523
Ray: This is
the Whaley house.

558
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,458
Time is 10:30.

559
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,128
We are proceeding
to the second floor.

560
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,645
When you see a ghost,
what does it look like?

561
00:31:55,712 --> 00:31:57,447
I'm just curious.

562
00:31:57,514 --> 00:32:01,017
I see them
like I see you.

563
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,320
Sometimes they're
wispy and filmy,

564
00:32:03,387 --> 00:32:05,455
just like
in the movies,

565
00:32:05,522 --> 00:32:08,658
but usually
they're solid.

566
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,430
Just another
state of being.

567
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:21,438
You get me?

568
00:32:21,505 --> 00:32:23,239
Kind of.

569
00:32:23,307 --> 00:32:24,975
Kind of like
how water

570
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:27,210
turns to steam,
you know.

571
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,911
[hinge creaks]

572
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,781
Ah, there we are.

573
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,549
Hello?

574
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:35,485
Who's there?

575
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,489
This is so cool.

576
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:47,197
Convinced yet?

577
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:48,931
About what?

578
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,702
Oh, come on.
That glass thing
down there was crazy.

579
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:54,237
Okay--
No, no, no. Stop.

580
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,707
You cannot tell me
that it was, like,
some sort of...

581
00:32:57,774 --> 00:32:58,908
That was Ray.
Trick.

582
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:01,144
That was Ray, okay?
It had to be.

583
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,446
No way. I mean,
how would he know

584
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,081
all that stuff
about Violet Whaley?

585
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,916
Look, I was
on the spot, okay?

586
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:09,619
I couldn't think
of any obscure info
on the house,

587
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:12,555
and Violet
was on my mind,
so I asked about her.

588
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:16,192
But the thing is
you can find all
that stuff out online

589
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,927
or by taking my tour.

590
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:19,929
Look, it wasn't
a ghost, okay?

591
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:22,632
It was probably
just Ray.

592
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,268
God, I love you.

593
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,569
Okay, Scully.

594
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,238
[creak]
whatever you say.

595
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,151
What do you see?

596
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:47,157
Nothing.

597
00:33:47,224 --> 00:33:48,891
It's probably
just the wind.

598
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,301
This is the heart
of the house.

599
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,738
The vortex?

600
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:36,806
You see?

601
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:37,807
[beep]

602
00:34:43,947 --> 00:34:46,316
It's 10 degrees cooler
where you're standing.

603
00:34:46,383 --> 00:34:49,385
What? No way.

604
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:51,521
That's not normal.

605
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,489
Right?

606
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:54,124
Sometimes
a ghost's presence

607
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:56,926
or a vortex
can create cold spots.

608
00:34:58,295 --> 00:35:01,030
Wait.
What's a, uh...

609
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:03,666
A vortex? For lack
of a better word,

610
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:07,003
it's a doorway
in and out of this reality,

611
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:10,573
usually found
at the heart
of haunted locations

612
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,143
there's someone here.

613
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,211
Tom? Thomas?

614
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,212
Oh, shit.

615
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,680
Is that your name?

616
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:18,781
[laughs]

617
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:19,749
Keith: Tom? Thomas?

618
00:35:19,816 --> 00:35:23,019
Talk to me.
Speak to me, please.

619
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:36,132
Why are you looking
at us like that?

620
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,134
Because...

621
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:41,304
He's standing
right behind you.

622
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,409
Ohh.
[laughter]

623
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,244
That's not funny,
all right?

624
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,280
I wasn't joking.

625
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,015
[clicking]

626
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:58,388
Does that mean that
there's something there?

627
00:35:58,455 --> 00:36:00,856
That means
there's something there.

628
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,961
We'd like to speak
with you, sir.

629
00:36:07,264 --> 00:36:09,666
[slam]

630
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:11,234
Yes. Yes.

631
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,703
Bang the wall again
for me, Thomas.

632
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:17,807
[slam]

633
00:36:17,874 --> 00:36:19,742
Yes. Yes.

634
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:26,048
Once for no,
and twice for yes.

635
00:36:26,116 --> 00:36:27,950
Okay?

636
00:36:28,018 --> 00:36:29,785
[slam slam]

637
00:36:29,853 --> 00:36:31,688
[creak]

638
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:34,524
Are you bound
to this house?

639
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:37,059
[slam]

640
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:39,929
[laughing]
Oh, my god.

641
00:36:39,996 --> 00:36:42,998
That was--
That was a no?

642
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:46,035
He's free-roaming?

643
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:49,639
Are there others
with you, Thomas?

644
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,343
[slam slam]

645
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,546
Are you here
with your family?

646
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,817
[slam slam]

647
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:03,185
[nervous laugh]

648
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:04,754
This can't
be happening.

649
00:37:07,991 --> 00:37:10,826
Thomas, if you're
not bound to the house,

650
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:13,496
can you tell us
why you're here?

651
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,965
Can you whisper it
into my ear?

652
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:21,404
Hey, did--
did Thomas Whaley
die in here?

653
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:24,674
No. He died
at his second house
in San Diego.

654
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:28,745
His wife Anna
and some other relatives
did die here, though.

655
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,847
That's why he's here.

656
00:37:31,915 --> 00:37:35,851
That's why he returns,
why he protects his house.

657
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:38,053
His loved ones
are trapped here...

658
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,157
bound to this world.

659
00:37:41,224 --> 00:37:44,860
He's here
to look over them.

660
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,302
And they don't like us
being here.

661
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:54,570
Okay, I'm done.
Let me go.

662
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:57,407
Mm, Giselle, please.

663
00:37:57,474 --> 00:37:59,008
No, Craig.
Go fuck yourself.

664
00:37:59,075 --> 00:38:01,711
This guy doesn't
like us being here,
so I'm going.

665
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,646
[sighs] Just stop
being such a baby.

666
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,682
Keith is here.
You'll be fucking fine.

667
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:08,217
Oh, why is that?
Is he, like, ghost
bulletproof or something?

668
00:38:08,285 --> 00:38:09,452
[muttering mockingly]

669
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,421
On the contrary,
my child.

670
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:14,190
They've come
after me first.

671
00:38:14,257 --> 00:38:17,126
They can attack me
spiritually,

672
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,061
and they know it.

673
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:20,963
Oh. Great.

674
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:24,934
Oh, hell, no!

675
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,903
What the fuck, Ray?!

676
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,707
You all need
to hear this shit.

677
00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:35,778
[soft static]

678
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,148
[slam on recording]

679
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:42,084
[laughing]
Oh, my god.

680
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:43,720
That was--
That was a no?

681
00:38:43,787 --> 00:38:45,020
[raspy]
Will...

682
00:38:45,088 --> 00:38:48,991
Di-i-ie.

683
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:53,028
That's a Class-A evp
if I ever heard one.

684
00:38:53,096 --> 00:38:55,064
[laughs]
Fuck me.

685
00:38:55,131 --> 00:38:57,667
How is that
possible?

686
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:05,107
Woman: Oh, crap.
What's wrong
with seal?

687
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,846
Keith, are--
Are you channeling?

688
00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:11,481
I'm fine.

689
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:13,082
I'm fine.

690
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:18,120
There's
someone else here.

691
00:39:18,188 --> 00:39:20,122
I-It's not Thomas.

692
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:31,501
It's the missis
of the house.

693
00:39:37,173 --> 00:39:38,941
What was that?

694
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,110
Anna says hi.

695
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,615
Come sit with me,
Anna.

696
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,818
[floor creaking]

697
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,687
You don't mind I'm
sitting on your bed, do you?

698
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:55,057
That's right.

699
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,358
Come over here.

700
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,561
[creaking continues]

701
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:04,600
Come. I won't hurt you.

702
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,302
Let's be friends.

703
00:40:08,271 --> 00:40:10,272
She's there?

704
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,007
She's here.

705
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,817
Ah.

706
00:40:20,884 --> 00:40:22,184
Ah.

707
00:40:22,252 --> 00:40:23,686
Oh, I see.

708
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:26,889
Her?

709
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,292
Me?

710
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,863
What about me?

711
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:36,566
Oh, god.

712
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:40,703
No, what about me?

713
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,674
She's gone.

714
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,143
You were pointing
at me. Why?

715
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:51,714
She recognizes you.

716
00:40:53,216 --> 00:40:55,651
Heh. She recognized me.

717
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,620
Maybe 'cause
you work here?

718
00:40:57,688 --> 00:41:01,524
Yeah. Oh, that's--
That's gotta be it.

719
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:02,859
Hold up.

720
00:41:05,195 --> 00:41:06,161
Listen.

721
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:08,531
Keith: Ah.

722
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:12,101
Ah. Oh, I see.

723
00:41:12,168 --> 00:41:13,669
Her?

724
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:16,472
Me? What about me?

725
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:21,410
[woman wails]

726
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:22,945
You all hear
that shit?

727
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:26,081
Yeah. I think
everybody heard
that shit.

728
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:27,750
Dude, this could
get us, like,

729
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,552
a show
on syfy channel
or something.

730
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,286
We should
be filming this.

731
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,258
[laughs]

732
00:41:36,326 --> 00:41:39,695
I think I just
shit myself
a little bit.

733
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:42,131
Okay, that's it.
I'm leaving.

734
00:41:42,198 --> 00:41:43,432
[rattles]

735
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,568
Giselle, ghosts
can't hurt you.

736
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:48,638
Actually,
they--they can.

737
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,741
There was
this case in 1987--

738
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:53,809
you know what?
I think Giselle's
right.

739
00:41:53,877 --> 00:41:55,110
We've overstayed
our welcome.

740
00:41:55,178 --> 00:41:57,413
They're just trying
to get our attention.

741
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,149
[rattling]

742
00:42:04,254 --> 00:42:06,722
This is a terrible way
to spend a Saturday night.

743
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:10,826
Looking for ghosts?
Walking around

744
00:42:10,894 --> 00:42:12,261
an old house
in the dark?

745
00:42:12,328 --> 00:42:14,196
What the fuck
is that all about?
It's stupid.

746
00:42:14,264 --> 00:42:15,798
If ghosts were real,
it wouldn't matter

747
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,832
when you
looked for them.

748
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,133
Ray: Well,
the theory is--

749
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:19,035
fuck the theory.

750
00:42:19,102 --> 00:42:21,037
They can have this
shitty-ass house

751
00:42:21,104 --> 00:42:22,204
to themselves.
They don't have to

752
00:42:22,272 --> 00:42:23,739
go around
slamming doors
in my face

753
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:25,608
or trying to scare
the shit out of me.

754
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:26,776
Gigi, calm down.

755
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:28,243
I'm calm, Vanessa.
I am super calm.

756
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:30,813
I just want
to get the fuck
out of this house.

757
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,048
Where are
the stairs?

758
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:33,716
They're down that way.

759
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:41,624
What? Don't look at me.
She's your friend.

760
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,125
Oh, come on.

761
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:44,827
Yeah, you'll be
thanking us

762
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,496
when we're making bank
off our ghost-hunting show.

763
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:50,633
Retarded,
the whole thing.

764
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:54,169
[creaks]

765
00:42:54,237 --> 00:42:56,438
Um, hello?

766
00:43:00,143 --> 00:43:01,077
[screams]

767
00:43:01,144 --> 00:43:02,078
[crack]

768
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,083
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

769
00:43:08,384 --> 00:43:10,152
Giselle. [gasping]

770
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,487
Giselle!

771
00:43:11,554 --> 00:43:13,489
Giselle.
Get down here!

772
00:43:13,556 --> 00:43:14,490
Oh, shit.

773
00:43:14,557 --> 00:43:16,425
Giselle.
Giselle.

774
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:17,459
Giselle.

775
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:19,495
No, no, no, no.

776
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:21,764
Penny: no, no.

777
00:43:23,066 --> 00:43:25,434
She must have tripped
down the stairs.

778
00:43:26,803 --> 00:43:29,505
No.
How's that happen?

779
00:43:29,572 --> 00:43:31,340
Giselle.
Is she okay?

780
00:43:31,407 --> 00:43:32,975
Giselle, honey.

781
00:43:35,812 --> 00:43:36,746
Craig: Penny,
is she...

782
00:43:36,813 --> 00:43:37,747
Penny: Hey.

783
00:43:37,814 --> 00:43:40,950
Giselle. No.

784
00:43:46,556 --> 00:43:49,358
No way, man.

785
00:43:49,425 --> 00:43:50,926
She--
she can't be.

786
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:52,862
Well, does she
have a pulse?

787
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:55,330
Giselle, honey.

788
00:43:55,398 --> 00:43:56,899
Giselle, honey.

789
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:00,302
Giselle, wake up.

790
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:07,543
This isn't good.

791
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:08,744
Yeah, no shit.

792
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,047
No, I mean
for the house.

793
00:44:11,114 --> 00:44:13,515
This isn't good
for the house.

794
00:44:18,388 --> 00:44:20,255
No way, man.

795
00:44:20,323 --> 00:44:23,059
We need to--
We need to call
for help, right?

796
00:44:25,261 --> 00:44:26,996
Right?

797
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:30,499
Penny, let me see
your phone.

798
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,803
Penny.

799
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:41,410
This isn't fucking
happening right now.

800
00:44:41,477 --> 00:44:44,180
Just shut up, Craig.

801
00:44:44,247 --> 00:44:46,481
Listen, both of you,
shut up.

802
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:48,517
What are you doing?

803
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,686
What the fuck does
it look like I'm doing?

804
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:51,754
What are you
talking about?

805
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:52,922
Who are you
gonna call?

806
00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:54,656
I'm gonna call 911.

807
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,992
No. No,
you can't do that.

808
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,929
Am I cra--
Get the fuck off me.

809
00:44:59,996 --> 00:45:01,731
Are you fucking crazy?
Don't be an idiot, man.

810
00:45:01,798 --> 00:45:03,232
Give me that fucking--
What the fuck--

811
00:45:03,299 --> 00:45:05,534
Give me the phone!
Fuck off, Craig.

812
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,036
This is fucking
serious, man!

813
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:08,838
Craig, man,
what are you doing?

814
00:45:08,905 --> 00:45:11,340
Don't you guys
fucking get it?!

815
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,978
It'll look
like we killed her.

816
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:23,252
Are you crazy?

817
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:25,487
Apparently
I'm the only one

818
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:28,357
processing
the situation
correctly here.

819
00:45:28,424 --> 00:45:31,460
You're such
a fucking asshole.

820
00:45:31,527 --> 00:45:33,796
I'm an asshole?

821
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:34,997
Yeah, you.

822
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,266
We broke
into a house...

823
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:41,203
and our friend fell
down the stairs, right?

824
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:47,176
Who is gonna buy
that shit?

825
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,879
If we don't call,
they'll think
we did it.

826
00:45:49,946 --> 00:45:52,748
No. No. No.

827
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:54,250
Listen, uh...

828
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:57,386
we get
out of here.

829
00:45:59,122 --> 00:46:01,257
We make it look
like she snuck in
by herself

830
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:02,691
and fell
down the stairs

831
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:04,260
while walking around
in the dark.

832
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:06,528
That way,
none of us get
any shit for this.

833
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:11,133
I am doing this
for all of you.

834
00:46:13,536 --> 00:46:15,938
Now we need to get
our stories straight.

835
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,240
Otherwise, they're gonna
pin this shit on us.

836
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:21,977
What in the name
of god are you
talking about?

837
00:46:22,979 --> 00:46:25,314
It was
an accident!

838
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:30,519
An accident?

839
00:46:31,654 --> 00:46:34,523
You think they're
gonna believe that?

840
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:37,359
Innocent people
go to jail
all the time!

841
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:39,862
Our friend is dead,
and you want to argue

842
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,964
about whether or not
we should call for help!

843
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:45,034
I'm just trying
to be realistic,
Pen, okay?

844
00:46:45,101 --> 00:46:46,969
This looks
really bad,

845
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:49,538
and we're not even
supposed to be here.

846
00:46:49,605 --> 00:46:51,207
No, this was your idea!

847
00:46:51,274 --> 00:46:53,909
Well, you didn't
have to let us in!

848
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,111
You could have
just said no!

849
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:58,314
You're just
as responsible
for this as--

850
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,327
[dials]

851
00:47:11,394 --> 00:47:12,427
[line rings]

852
00:47:12,495 --> 00:47:14,930
911. Please state the nature
of your emergency.

853
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,932
Yes, hello.
My name is Penny Abbott,

854
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,700
And I'm
at the Whaley house.

855
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:23,239
Did you say,
"The Whaley House"?

856
00:47:23,306 --> 00:47:24,673
Yes, there's been
an accident.

857
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:27,409
My friend, she fell
down a flight
of stairs and--

858
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,711
I'm sorry. I can't
hear you too well, ma'am.

859
00:47:29,779 --> 00:47:30,846
Did you say
an accident?

860
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,414
Yes. My friend,
she fell.

861
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:34,716
She fell down
a flight of stairs.

862
00:47:34,784 --> 00:47:36,285
Ma'am, are you
still there?

863
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,153
Yes, I'm still here!
Hello?!

864
00:47:38,221 --> 00:47:39,554
Ma'am, are you there?

865
00:47:39,622 --> 00:47:41,490
I'm gonna send--[static]
hello! I'm here!

866
00:47:41,557 --> 00:47:42,491
Can you hear me?

867
00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:45,094
Ma'am,
we'll send some--

868
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:46,528
My friend...

869
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:49,365
oh, come on!

870
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,467
What happened?

871
00:47:52,535 --> 00:47:54,036
My battery died.

872
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:56,171
That happens.

873
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:58,540
Sometimes
a spirit will drain
battery power

874
00:47:58,608 --> 00:48:02,311
from cameras,
meters, even
flashlights.

875
00:48:03,746 --> 00:48:05,680
They feed off it.

876
00:48:05,748 --> 00:48:09,184
Will you cut the crap
with that ghost shit?!

877
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:14,623
Well, did
you at least
get through?

878
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:15,857
I don't know.

879
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:18,093
Well, did you,
or didn't you?
What do you mean?

880
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:19,962
I don't know, okay?
I spoke with someone,

881
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,164
but I don't know
if they could hear me.

882
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,933
I--I don't know.
What...

883
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,201
probably better
that way.

884
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:27,903
Now you shut
the fuck up, man!

885
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:29,171
Just trying to help.

886
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,272
Fucking idiot.

887
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:34,143
Both of you
just stop, okay?

888
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,448
I'm gonna get...

889
00:48:42,785 --> 00:48:44,686
Ahh!

890
00:48:44,754 --> 00:48:46,521
It's hot.

891
00:48:46,589 --> 00:48:48,223
I'm afraid...

892
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:50,359
they won't
let us go.

893
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,827
What?

894
00:48:51,894 --> 00:48:54,596
I never felt it
like this before.

895
00:48:54,664 --> 00:48:56,098
It's like hate.

896
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:01,236
Energy coursing
through this house,

897
00:49:01,304 --> 00:49:02,804
it's omnipotent.

898
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:21,323
Your poor friend's
death,

899
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:23,658
that strengthened them.

900
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,562
Strengthened them how?

901
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,731
I hear voices.

902
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,335
I hear a lot of them.

903
00:49:34,904 --> 00:49:36,171
They're saying...

904
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:40,142
Blood has been spilled.

905
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,510
When we die,

906
00:49:41,577 --> 00:49:44,179
we open the doorway
to the next world

907
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,515
for our soul.

908
00:49:46,582 --> 00:49:48,550
Like the vortex?

909
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:49,551
No.

910
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,787
The vortex
is always open
and weaker,

911
00:49:52,855 --> 00:49:57,092
but a fresh death tears
the next world open.

912
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,394
Wait. What are
you saying, man?

913
00:49:58,461 --> 00:50:00,795
Your friend's death...

914
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:04,599
No, wait.

915
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:11,040
Not just your friend.

916
00:50:11,107 --> 00:50:13,375
There has been--

917
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:16,611
There has been
more blood spilled
on the property.

918
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:18,213
More blood?

919
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:19,781
What--what about
that woman

920
00:50:19,849 --> 00:50:22,017
Who spazzed out
earlier this afternoon?

921
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:23,419
She--she's not dead.

922
00:50:23,486 --> 00:50:26,255
She was alive
when they took her
to the hospital.

923
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,628
I see a woman
and two men

924
00:50:33,696 --> 00:50:35,364
right there.

925
00:50:36,766 --> 00:50:37,699
Oh, shit!

926
00:50:38,968 --> 00:50:41,470
[clicking]

927
00:50:43,706 --> 00:50:47,309
Their deaths has
opened the portal wide,

928
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,677
wider than ever...

929
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:52,081
And they're
keeping it open,

930
00:50:52,148 --> 00:50:55,317
drawing strength
from both sides.

931
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:01,856
No. He is.

932
00:51:03,759 --> 00:51:07,796
I hear you.
I hear you, Mr. Whaley.

933
00:51:10,032 --> 00:51:14,369
He can finally
bring his family over
to the other side.

934
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:19,341
The portal has
allowed them a way out,

935
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,344
but he's propping it
open for some reason.

936
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,749
I'm afraid they aim
to do us harm.

937
00:51:32,688 --> 00:51:36,525
Why? What did
we ever do to them?

938
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,528
It's because of her.

939
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,664
No, not this again.

940
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:46,801
Yeah, enough of this.
Let's smash a window.

941
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:49,904
Shh. Stand still.

942
00:51:49,972 --> 00:51:52,608
[clock ticking]

943
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,011
Do you all feel that?

944
00:51:59,582 --> 00:52:01,716
What?

945
00:52:01,784 --> 00:52:04,620
[house rumbling]

946
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:09,558
Ahh!
Oh, no.

947
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,960
[crying]

948
00:52:21,837 --> 00:52:25,307
What the fuck
was that all about?

949
00:52:26,509 --> 00:52:27,742
It's okay.

950
00:52:29,945 --> 00:52:31,146
Just an earthquake?

951
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:32,347
Not an earthquake.

952
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:34,816
That was the portal,
my young friends.

953
00:52:36,252 --> 00:52:38,654
It was trying to close,
but it can't,

954
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:40,556
so it's affecting
our reality.

955
00:52:40,623 --> 00:52:43,091
Shit!

956
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:46,061
They broke
my equipment!

957
00:52:46,128 --> 00:52:48,197
You okay, man?

958
00:52:48,264 --> 00:52:49,764
No, I am not okay!

959
00:52:49,832 --> 00:52:52,701
Do you know how expensive
this shit is?!

960
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:56,471
You just can't
run down to walmart

961
00:52:56,539 --> 00:52:58,740
and buy a--
A trifield meter.

962
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:01,376
Damn it!

963
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,512
Now some
stupid-ass ghost

964
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,448
Has to come
and break my shit?

965
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:07,449
Cuz, it's okay.

966
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,818
No, it's not okay.

967
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,621
Fuck you, ghost!

968
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,356
Do you hear me?!
Ray.

969
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:17,392
Who the hell
do you think you are,
breaking a man's shit?

970
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,394
Do you know how hard
I work for this--

971
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:22,897
I work a minimum-wage job
to afford this shit,

972
00:53:22,965 --> 00:53:25,834
and you just gonna
come and break it?

973
00:53:25,901 --> 00:53:28,237
Fuck you!

974
00:53:28,304 --> 00:53:30,105
Ray, be careful.

975
00:53:30,172 --> 00:53:31,506
They're listening.

976
00:53:31,574 --> 00:53:34,175
Good! I hope
they hear me!

977
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:38,647
Damn ghosts
can suck my dick.

978
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,117
Come on, ghosts!
Where are you?!

979
00:53:42,184 --> 00:53:45,520
Come on, now.
Bang on a wall now,
motherfucker.

980
00:53:45,588 --> 00:53:47,756
Ray, stop it.
Don't call them out.

981
00:53:47,823 --> 00:53:49,324
You'll
make them angry.

982
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,059
Good! Where are you?!

983
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:54,529
Where are you? 10 years,
I been looking for you.

984
00:53:54,597 --> 00:53:56,531
10 years, and nothing.

985
00:53:56,599 --> 00:53:58,833
Heh. Maybe a noise here.

986
00:53:58,901 --> 00:54:01,303
Maybe a whisper there,
but that's all crap.

987
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:03,138
Ray.
If you're there,

988
00:54:03,205 --> 00:54:04,706
I want to fucking
see you.

989
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,441
Don't do that.
Here I am.

990
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:09,210
Come and get me,
motherfuckers!

991
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:10,612

Okay, okay, okay.

[Vanessa crying]

1002
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:59,994
Shh. Shh. Okay.

1003
00:55:00,062 --> 00:55:00,929
This isn't right.

1004
00:55:00,996 --> 00:55:03,598
None of this,
this isn't right.

1005
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,867
This is--Penny,
I want to go home.

1006
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:07,869
We're--
I want to go home.

1007
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:10,138
We're gonna get
out of here, okay?

1008
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:13,608
No. No,
I know we're not.
Don't lie to me.

1009
00:55:13,676 --> 00:55:15,744
Vanessa,
we're gonna be okay,

1010
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,146
all right?
You gotta stay strong.

1011
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:19,514
Gotta stay strong, okay?

1012
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:22,818
[footsteps upstairs]

00:55:22,885 --> 00:55:25,119

1015
00:55:26,422 --> 00:55:28,089
Okay. It's okay.

[footsteps continue]

1018
00:55:36,198 --> 00:55:38,032
He's up there.

1019
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,835
They all are.

1021
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:47,876
Anything?

1022
00:55:47,943 --> 00:55:50,044
What?

1023
00:55:50,112 --> 00:55:52,681
No. No, the doors
are locked solid.

1024
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:56,251
Yeah, it's like
a meat locker
back there.

1026
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,229
Are you seriously
going back up there?

[slam slam]
Well, yes.

1028
00:56:13,302 --> 00:56:15,236
We have
to talk to them,

1029
00:56:15,304 --> 00:56:16,938
ask for
their forgiveness.

1030
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:19,608
Maybe they'll
let us out

1031
00:56:19,675 --> 00:56:21,142
if we plead
for mercy.

1032
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:22,477
Plea for mercy?

1033
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,380
What about all that
"power of christ
compels you" stuff?

1034
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:28,349
Shouldn't we able
to force them
to let us go?

1035
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:30,218
They're not like that.

1036
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:31,820
They aren't evil.

1037
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:35,189
[laughs]

1038
00:56:35,257 --> 00:56:36,391
They aren't?

00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:38,059
They aren't evil?

1040
00:56:38,127 --> 00:56:40,028
Ray is dead, okay?!

1041
00:56:40,095 --> 00:56:41,863
Giselle is dead.

1042
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:44,633
I know. No,
they're just desperate.

1043
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,401
Desperate for what?

1044
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:47,602
You.

1045
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,673
But I'm not sure why.

1046
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,675
It's okay.

1047
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:00,415
You guys can stay here
if you want.

1048
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,283
I'm going up
to find out.

1049
00:57:13,295 --> 00:57:15,263
It's cold
up here, too.

1050
00:57:20,169 --> 00:57:21,302
Whaley family,

1051
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,905
we come as friends.

1052
00:57:26,809 --> 00:57:28,610
Where can we speak?

No! No! No!

1054
00:58:04,847 --> 00:58:06,347

Vanessa,
are you hurt?

00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:12,654
What happened?

1060
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:14,188
She grabbed me!

00:58:14,256 --> 00:58:16,257
She grabbed me!

1062
00:58:16,325 --> 00:58:18,292
What? But there's--

1063
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,861
There's nobody
in here.

1064
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:22,263

Look.

What is it?

1070
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:37,579
I see something.

1071
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:38,580
Where?

1072
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:39,781
Thomas?

1073
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,785
It's not Thomas.

1074
00:58:45,521 --> 00:58:47,422
Keith, what is it?

1075
00:58:48,991 --> 00:58:50,592
Back up!

00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,960
Back up now!

1077
00:58:53,495 --> 00:58:54,896
Go back!

1078
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:56,965
Go away! Go back!

1079
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:01,469
[Vanessa sobbing]

1080
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:02,904
[Penny murmuring,
shushing]

1081
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:04,873
Please,
it's okay.

1082
00:59:06,842 --> 00:59:09,110
Okay. It's okay.

1083
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:10,378
It's okay.

1084
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:11,746
What was it?

1085
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:14,783
What the hell
did you see, man?

1086
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:16,751
It wasn't--

1087
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,286
It wasn't human.

1088
00:59:18,353 --> 00:59:21,422
[scoffs]
Not human?

1089
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:23,558
[sobbing]
Like what?

1090
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:25,794
Like a fucking demon
or something?

1091
00:59:25,861 --> 00:59:27,428
Okay,
stay with me, okay?

1092
00:59:27,496 --> 00:59:29,464
Okay, I thought you said
they were just ghosts.

1093
00:59:29,531 --> 00:59:31,232
[Vanessa crying]

1094
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,968
It wasn't a Whaley.

1095
00:59:33,869 --> 00:59:35,737
Stay with me, okay?

1096
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:38,406
I know. I know. I know.
I know. I know. I know.

1097
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:41,209
It said its name
was Santiago.

1098
00:59:42,878 --> 00:59:44,378
Yankee Jim?

1099
00:59:47,449 --> 00:59:49,117
Who's Yankee Jim?

1100
00:59:49,184 --> 00:59:51,419
He was hanged
on the property

1101
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:52,954
when it was
a gallows.

1102
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:54,990
He was too tall
for the noose,

1103
00:59:55,057 --> 00:59:57,558
so he stood
on his tiptoes
when they dropped him.

1104
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,027
Penny: Shh.

1105
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,062
It took him
hours to die.

1106
01:00:03,532 --> 01:00:05,000
His real name
was Santiago,

1107
01:00:05,067 --> 01:00:07,802
and he's
supposed to be one
of the resident ghosts.

1108
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:11,539
So, what? So he's
not human anymore?

1109
01:00:11,607 --> 01:00:13,608
W-what the fuck?

1110
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:15,877
He told me he died bad.

1111
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,912
He stayed bad.

1112
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:20,148
[screaming]
Stop!

1113
01:00:20,215 --> 01:00:21,716
Stay out!

1114
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,051
Stay back!

1115
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,020
You have no power
over us!

1116
01:00:25,087 --> 01:00:26,688
Go away!

1117
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:28,857
Go away!

1118
01:00:28,924 --> 01:00:30,892
He's gonna
break the fucking
door down!

1119
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:36,564
See?
I fucking told you!

1120
01:00:36,632 --> 01:00:38,166
[Vanessa sobbing]

1121
01:00:40,435 --> 01:00:41,536
Oh, my god.

1122
01:00:41,603 --> 01:00:43,938
[sobbing continues]

1123
01:00:44,006 --> 01:00:46,207
Santiago,
is that you?

1124
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:47,208
Oh, my god.

1125
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:49,811
[sobbing ends]

1126
01:00:51,613 --> 01:00:53,014
He's gone.

1127
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:54,115
Well, he was sure
as shit there

1128
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:55,216
a fucking
minute ago.

1129
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:57,118
I figure it's
exhausted itself

1130
01:00:57,186 --> 01:01:00,188
with the door
and needs to rest.

1131
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:03,658
Why is he an it?
If he was--

1132
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:05,827
If he was human once,
why is he an it?

1133
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:07,562
He died bad...

1134
01:01:09,398 --> 01:01:10,799
on the wrong side.

1135
01:01:12,601 --> 01:01:13,802
What is that stuff?

1136
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:16,671
Purified and
blessed sea salt

1137
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:18,773
with powdered angelica root.

1138
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,342
Helps to protect
against negative energy.

1139
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:23,377
Oh, is that gonna
keep them outside?

1140
01:01:24,479 --> 01:01:25,613
It should work.

1141
01:01:25,681 --> 01:01:27,115
[rumbling]

1142
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,282
Ah, shit!

1143
01:01:29,384 --> 01:01:31,319
[crickets chirping]

1144
01:01:31,386 --> 01:01:33,888
[thunder rumbling]

1145
01:01:39,261 --> 01:01:42,097
You ever been
in this place before?

1146
01:01:42,164 --> 01:01:44,565
No.

1147
01:01:44,633 --> 01:01:46,901
They say it's haunted.

1148
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:48,837
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1149
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:56,644
You get a bunch
of prank calls
about this place?

1150
01:01:56,712 --> 01:01:59,480
None. This might be
the first one.

1151
01:01:59,548 --> 01:02:01,282
[rings doorbell]

1152
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:08,156
[thunder crashes]

1153
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,390
Anything?

1154
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:12,227
Place looks like
it's been ransacked.

1155
01:02:12,294 --> 01:02:13,895
Any ghosts?

1156
01:02:16,498 --> 01:02:18,233
Let's go around back.

1157
01:02:25,941 --> 01:02:27,408
Look.

1158
01:02:27,476 --> 01:02:29,177
Probable cause.

1159
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,247
Go.

1160
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:35,383
SDPD!

1161
01:02:40,122 --> 01:02:42,456
SDPD! Who's here?!

1162
01:02:42,524 --> 01:02:43,992
Bodies.

1163
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:49,730
Pretty sure they
wouldn't have a pulse
if I checked anyway.

1164
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:51,199
You want to call it in?

1165
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:52,200
I got it.

1166
01:03:02,711 --> 01:03:05,579
We are so fucked
right now.

1167
01:03:05,647 --> 01:03:07,882
I--I mean, like--

1168
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,083
Shh, shh, shh.

1169
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:12,854
I mean, like fucked---

1170
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:14,722
Shut up! Shut up.
Listen.

1171
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:15,723
Like really fucked.

1172
01:03:15,791 --> 01:03:16,925
Listen! Listen!
Just...

1173
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:20,528
Officer: This is
the San Diego
police department!

1174
01:03:20,595 --> 01:03:23,364
Is anybody sick
or injured in the house?

1175
01:03:27,369 --> 01:03:29,971
Dispatch, this is
Officer Downs. Come back.

1176
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:33,875
Dispatch, do you copy?

1177
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:35,210
What, is it wonky?

1178
01:03:35,277 --> 01:03:37,678
Signal's doing something.
Try yours.

1179
01:03:37,746 --> 01:03:39,214
Hey! Hey!

1180
01:03:39,281 --> 01:03:40,915
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

1181
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,116
Put your hands up!

1182
01:03:42,184 --> 01:03:44,485
I was the one that
called you guys, okay?

1183
01:03:44,553 --> 01:03:46,855
All right, come down here.
Keep your hands where
we can see 'em.

1184
01:03:46,922 --> 01:03:49,123
There are more of us.
One of us is hurt.

1185
01:03:49,191 --> 01:03:52,660
[woman sobbing]

1186
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:55,763
I got it.

1187
01:03:55,831 --> 01:03:57,732
Okay, you go.
I got them.

1188
01:03:57,799 --> 01:03:59,300
Where is he going?

1189
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:01,569
[crying]

1190
01:04:01,636 --> 01:04:02,871
Ma'am.

1191
01:04:02,938 --> 01:04:04,172
Ma'am, San Diego police.

1192
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,840
Are you all right?

1193
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:07,976
[crying]

1194
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:10,845
Ma'am, are you hurt?

1195
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:12,613
Officer: Okay,
hold it, you two.

1196
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:17,018
Where's your friends?

1197
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,021
Go, go, go, go, go.

1198
01:04:21,857 --> 01:04:23,457
Gates!
Gates: Oh, my god.

1199
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,094
Gates, what is it?

1200
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:36,737
[gasping]

1201
01:04:43,979 --> 01:04:47,348
[gurgling]

1202
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,366
What's he doing?

1203
01:05:14,209 --> 01:05:16,010
Hey, cool it
with that stuff, man.

1204
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:21,082
Shit. You think
chairs are gonna keep
those fuckers out, man?

1205
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:24,419
This is magic, dude.
This'll work.

1206
01:05:24,486 --> 01:05:26,887
Gates: This is ridiculous.
What the fuck?

1207
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:29,490
Dispatch, come back. Over.

1208
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:30,825
Dispatch.

1209
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:34,062
Still not working?

1210
01:05:34,129 --> 01:05:36,264
No, it isn't.

1211
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:38,566
Backup'll be here soon,
though, right?

1212
01:05:38,633 --> 01:05:41,369
I mean, you guys
can't just fall
off the map, huh?

1213
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,504
Yeah, if we don't
check in within
half an hour,

1214
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:44,973
they send
another squad car out.

1215
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,208
I hope it's
not too long.

1216
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:50,378
Vanessa isn't
doing very well.

1217
01:05:52,747 --> 01:05:53,547
Yeah, but--

1218
01:05:53,615 --> 01:05:56,617
But she'll
be okay, right?

1219
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:04,959
No.

1220
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:07,495
No, she's not.

1221
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:10,564
[creaks]

1222
01:06:14,903 --> 01:06:17,138
I know you're there.

1223
01:06:18,707 --> 01:06:20,574
I know you are.

1224
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,445
Who's there?

1225
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:31,319
Come on out.

1226
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:35,956
Wait.

1227
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:37,691
You think we should
leave the room?

1228
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:41,029
I wouldn't do that.

1229
01:06:41,096 --> 01:06:42,230
I'll be right back.

1230
01:06:42,297 --> 01:06:43,664
She looks like Lisa.

1231
01:06:47,102 --> 01:06:50,604
Hey, this salt
stuff'll protect us
in here, right?

1232
01:06:50,672 --> 01:06:54,242
Yes, unless there's
something in here already.

1233
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:04,385
[giggles]

1234
01:07:11,993 --> 01:07:13,394
I know you're here.

1235
01:07:14,963 --> 01:07:16,364
What's your name, child?

1236
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:21,835
What's your name,
sweetheart?

1237
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:36,850
[giggling]

1238
01:07:38,887 --> 01:07:40,455
Wait, sweetheart.

1239
01:07:46,728 --> 01:07:47,728
What about Keith?

1240
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,232
Man, fuck Keith, okay?

1241
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:54,135
He can take it down
when he gets back.

1242
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:55,836
Just--Here.
Help me, please.

1243
01:07:55,904 --> 01:07:58,372
[humming, murmuring]

1244
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:04,445
Hey, I think there
might be something
wrong with your friend.

1245
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:08,882
Hey, baby,
are you okay?

1246
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,687
[continues humming]

1247
01:08:13,755 --> 01:08:15,389
Vanessa.

1248
01:08:16,891 --> 01:08:19,127
What is she saying?

1249
01:08:19,194 --> 01:08:20,328
Baby.

1250
01:08:27,302 --> 01:08:28,736
Fuck me!
Shit!

1251
01:08:32,674 --> 01:08:33,741
Holy shit!

1252
01:08:35,777 --> 01:08:36,844
Fucking freeze!

1253
01:08:37,946 --> 01:08:41,949
This is my house.

1254
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:43,651
My house.

1255
01:08:45,887 --> 01:08:47,588
Will die.

1256
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:50,424
Vanessa.

1257
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:56,364
You--

1258
01:08:56,431 --> 01:08:58,633
Vanessa, what's--

1259
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,368
Vanessa--

1260
01:09:00,435 --> 01:09:03,771
Vanessa is asleep.

1261
01:09:05,874 --> 01:09:07,542
You're not Vanessa.

1262
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:21,355
You belong to us.

1263
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:23,424
Why are you
doing this?

1264
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,926
We want you back.

1265
01:09:27,262 --> 01:09:29,363
Back from what?

1266
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:32,132
You ours.

1267
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:33,934
How am I yours?

1268
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:37,037
You missing.

1269
01:09:37,105 --> 01:09:39,607
You're missing me?

1270
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:40,808
Baby.

1271
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:43,578
I...

1272
01:09:43,645 --> 01:09:45,045
Baby.

1273
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,118
Hey, give us
our friend back.

1274
01:09:51,186 --> 01:09:52,286
[creaks]

1275
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:53,954
Be careful.

1276
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:59,694
She is not yours.

1277
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:02,963
Ours.

1278
01:10:07,502 --> 01:10:09,770
She, too...

1279
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:11,071
Hey.

1280
01:10:18,146 --> 01:10:20,381
Ours.

1281
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:23,684
Who are you?

1282
01:10:26,988 --> 01:10:28,589
[gasping]

1283
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:30,791
No!
Look out! What is she--

1284
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:32,393
Penny: No.

1285
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:34,828
Watch out!
Vanessa!

1286
01:10:34,896 --> 01:10:36,597
Honey, it's okay.
[sobs]

1287
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:38,366
It's okay. It's okay.

1288
01:10:38,433 --> 01:10:39,734
What--

1289
01:10:39,801 --> 01:10:42,035
What happened?
You know, I don't--

1290
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:48,276
No. Now they're
fucking possessing us.

1291
01:10:48,343 --> 01:10:50,444
[gasping]

1292
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:53,281
I have had it
with this shit, man!

1293
01:10:53,348 --> 01:10:54,448
Hey, stay calm.

1294
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:56,116
I'm getting
the fuck out of here!

1295
01:10:56,184 --> 01:10:58,786
I'm not gonna wait
for these fucks
to kill us all!

1296
01:10:59,854 --> 01:11:01,622
Craig, wait.

1297
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:04,892
I'm gonna break
this fucking window!

1298
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:06,394
Craig!

1299
01:11:07,262 --> 01:11:09,129
No!
[screams]

1300
01:11:09,197 --> 01:11:11,031
Craig!
[sobs]

1301
01:11:12,867 --> 01:11:14,669
What?

1302
01:11:19,741 --> 01:11:21,875
[crickets chirping]

1303
01:11:23,578 --> 01:11:25,713
[clock ticking]

1304
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:31,185
[soft whispering]

1305
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:40,328
Where'd you go, child?

1306
01:11:40,395 --> 01:11:42,196
I know you're up here.

1307
01:11:42,263 --> 01:11:44,198
[whispering continues]

1308
01:11:58,613 --> 01:11:59,647
Don't be afraid.

1309
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:03,984
You know, I had
a daughter once.

1310
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:08,489
[chuckles]
She was so beautiful,

1311
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:11,425
had a smile that
would make my day.

1312
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,994
[whispering]

1313
01:12:14,062 --> 01:12:16,063
Her name was Lisa.

1314
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:17,665
[whispering]

1315
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:20,368
She's gone now, too.

1316
01:12:20,435 --> 01:12:22,370
She was hit by a car...

1317
01:12:22,437 --> 01:12:24,338
[whispering]

1318
01:12:24,406 --> 01:12:27,541
her and her mommy,

1319
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:29,477
a long time ago.

1320
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:33,213
[breathes deeply]

1321
01:12:33,281 --> 01:12:35,883
[whispering]

1322
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:38,552
I miss my little girl
very much.

1323
01:12:40,555 --> 01:12:43,056
I remember
the hugs the best.

1324
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:47,561
May I give you a hug?

1325
01:12:48,463 --> 01:12:52,199
[screams]

1326
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:57,605
I'm sorry, sweetie.

1327
01:12:57,672 --> 01:12:59,239
I'm sorry.

1328
01:12:59,307 --> 01:13:01,675
Where'd you go,
sweetheart?

1329
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:06,781
Where are you,
sweetheart?

1330
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,693
What is this?

1331
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:25,933
Not supposed
to be there.

1332
01:13:32,373 --> 01:13:35,375
[gurgles]

1333
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:38,646
[screams echoing]

1334
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:43,818
[crying]

1335
01:13:43,885 --> 01:13:46,754
Vanessa: Why would
they do that to Craig?

1336
01:14:00,368 --> 01:14:03,036
Penny:
Jesus, Vanessa!

1337
01:14:03,104 --> 01:14:04,037
Shh, shh, shh.

1338
01:14:04,105 --> 01:14:06,273
Vanessa, just--
Just stop it, okay?

1339
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:08,642
Sweetie, please.
Please.

1340
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:12,446
Vanessa, Vanessa,
Vanessa.

1341
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:13,681
Vanessa, Vanessa,
Vanessa, Vanessa,

1342
01:14:13,748 --> 01:14:15,082
Put the gun down.

1343
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:20,053
You don't need that.

1344
01:14:20,121 --> 01:14:21,822
Of course I do.

1345
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:29,864
It's because of you
that we're all here.

1346
01:14:32,066 --> 01:14:35,936
You deserve to die
more than Craig did.

1347
01:14:38,072 --> 01:14:39,373
[laughs]

1348
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:42,009
She's fucking
lost it.

1349
01:14:42,076 --> 01:14:43,878
She's fucking
lost it.

1350
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:47,280
They aren't
gonna let us leave.

1351
01:14:47,348 --> 01:14:49,917
Can't you see that?

1352
01:14:52,186 --> 01:14:54,187
I mean, they win.

1353
01:14:54,255 --> 01:14:57,691
[laughs]

1354
01:14:57,759 --> 01:14:59,560
They win, right?

1355
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:02,696
I mean, they win, right?

1356
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:06,967
[laughing]

1357
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,105
They win.

1358
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:15,075
Vanessa,
Vanessa, don't.

1359
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:16,076
Don't, babe.

1360
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:23,316
Vanessa, what are you doing?
Just--Just stop it, okay?

1361
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,320
She won't let me.

1362
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:36,363
[whispering]
You have to. Do it.
Stay with us.

1363
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:38,699
[laughs]

1364
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:43,336
Ah, she wants it
to be like Violet.

1365
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:47,675
Penny: Vanessa,
put the fucking
gun down!

1366
01:15:52,146 --> 01:15:55,883
Violet died
of a broken heart.

1367
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:00,054
Me, too.

1368
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:05,358
[murmurs]

1369
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:12,600
No! Vanessa, no!

1370
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:13,667
No.

1371
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,435
Get her.

1372
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:18,572
[sobs]

1373
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,741
Vanessa. Vanessa.

1374
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:23,443
It's okay.

1375
01:16:23,511 --> 01:16:25,613
It's okay.

1376
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:29,149
It's not so bad.

1377
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:30,684
They think...

1378
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:33,220
You're Violet.

1379
01:16:33,287 --> 01:16:35,856
[sobbing]

1380
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:48,035
Penny.

1381
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:49,036
Penny.

1382
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:53,807
Penny.

1383
01:16:56,811 --> 01:16:57,945
I'm done.

1384
01:17:01,282 --> 01:17:02,850
I give up.

1385
01:17:02,917 --> 01:17:05,853
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

1386
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,623
No, don't--
Don't you say that.

1387
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:11,358
Don't you say that, okay?

1388
01:17:11,425 --> 01:17:13,360
We can get out of this.

1389
01:17:13,427 --> 01:17:14,928
No.

1390
01:17:14,996 --> 01:17:18,132
We can't.
We can't.

1391
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,304
Listen.

1392
01:17:24,372 --> 01:17:25,773
We can--

1393
01:17:27,575 --> 01:17:30,410
We can at least try.

1394
01:17:30,478 --> 01:17:32,212
Okay?

1395
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,313
Okay?

1396
01:17:33,381 --> 01:17:34,314
Okay?

1397
01:17:39,654 --> 01:17:41,789
Okay, I need you
to focus.

1398
01:17:44,559 --> 01:17:46,860
Penny, need you to focus.

1399
01:17:49,497 --> 01:17:51,198
Hey.

1400
01:17:51,265 --> 01:17:52,032
Fire escape.

1401
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:53,901
What?
The fire escape.

1402
01:17:53,968 --> 01:17:54,935
What fire escape?

1403
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:56,670
The fire--
There's a fire--

1404
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:58,205
A hatch
in the attic.

1405
01:17:58,272 --> 01:18:00,708
There's
a fire escape,

1406
01:18:00,775 --> 01:18:02,242
a way out of here.

1407
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:05,079
Okay. Okay.
Okay, Penny, let's go.

1408
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:14,888
Where is it?

1409
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:16,456
It's back
around here.

1410
01:18:16,524 --> 01:18:18,826
It's padlocked,
but maybe we can
rip it from the wall.

1411
01:18:18,893 --> 01:18:20,260
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

1412
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:21,261
What?

1413
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:24,098
It must have
been Keith's.

1414
01:18:24,165 --> 01:18:26,033
Penny: Then
he's up here?

1415
01:18:31,639 --> 01:18:33,941
[screams]
[yelling]

1416
01:18:34,008 --> 01:18:37,177
Oh, my god! Pull me!
Pull me! Pull me!

1418
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:40,214
Pull me out!
Pull me out!

1419
01:18:40,281 --> 01:18:42,182
Penny! Aah!

1420
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,617
[gasping]

1421
01:18:43,684 --> 01:18:45,219
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Shit! Shit!

1423
01:18:49,657 --> 01:18:51,524
Oh, my god! Aah!

1424
01:18:51,592 --> 01:18:54,161
What the--What--

1425
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:58,866
What the fuck?! Aah!

1426
01:18:58,933 --> 01:19:01,635
[screaming]

1427
01:19:01,702 --> 01:19:03,270
Jake!

1428
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,967
No! No! Please!

1429
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:36,870
No! No! Aah!

1430
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:39,006
No, please. No, please.

1431
01:19:39,073 --> 01:19:41,308
Please, just let me go.
Please.

1432
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:43,410
Aah! No!

1433
01:19:43,477 --> 01:19:44,845
Please, no.

1434
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:46,313
No, please.

1435
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:48,648
[screaming]

1436
01:20:00,761 --> 01:20:02,562
Violet.
Violet.

1437
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:03,931
Baby.
We love you.

Violet.
We've missed you.

1443

I'm not Violet.

1444
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:13,173
Violet.
You belong to us.

1445
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:15,642
My name is Penny.

No. No.

1482
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:17,497
I'm not, not for
a very long time.

1483
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:23,003
We'll need you
to come down and make
a statement at the station.

1484
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,738
Oh, does it have
to be this second?

1485
01:22:25,806 --> 01:22:27,341
I'm afraid so, ma'am.

1486
01:22:28,676 --> 01:22:32,612
Are you okay to drive,
or would you
like a ride?

1487
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,147
I can drive.

1488
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:37,717

Oh, Bethany,

Damn this house.

She wasn't
yours to take.

1497
01:23:53,627 --> 01:23:56,296
They didn't
take me, Bethany.
I'm right here.

But they
didn't take me.

You did look
so much like her.

1503
01:24:14,348 --> 01:24:17,016
Why can't you
hear me, Bethany?

1504
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:21,054
You just had
to have her.

1505
01:24:21,122 --> 01:24:23,190
Why can't you
hear me?

1506

Penny, dear?

1511
01:24:38,739 --> 01:24:43,810
Oh, Penny,
I'm so very sorry.

But don't worry.

1513
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:51,551
You won't be lonely.

1514
01:24:53,454 --> 01:24:55,822
I'll be around.
