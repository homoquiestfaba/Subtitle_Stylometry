1
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:18,906
<i>And now, back to the one man
in America who really gets it.</i>

2
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:28,585
<i>Alrighty, welcome back.</i>

3
00:00:28,747 --> 00:00:33,696
<i>I'm here with the lovely Debra
and her beau, Joel.</i>

4
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:36,742
<i>Now, let's slap on our swim trunks...</i>

5
00:00:36,907 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>...and go for a dip in Lake Joel.</i>

6
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:42,864
What is going on?

7
00:00:43,027 --> 00:00:46,940
<i>The little lady says
you have no direction, no passion.</i>

8
00:00:47,107 --> 00:00:51,737
<i>The audience wants to hear your story.
I wanna hear your story.</i>

9
00:00:51,907 --> 00:00:55,217
<i>Right now, I work at Gutters.
It's a bowling alley.</i>

10
00:00:55,387 --> 00:00:58,936
<i>Bowling, all right.
I bowled a 280 last week.</i>

11
00:01:00,107 --> 00:01:02,575
<i>College grad like you must be what,
manager?</i>

12
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:06,296
<i>No, actually, no.</i>

13
00:01:08,547 --> 00:01:10,822
<i>I give out shoes, and then
when they come back, I spray them.</i>

14
00:01:12,387 --> 00:01:15,026
<i>And then I put them in their cubbies.</i>

15
00:01:15,187 --> 00:01:17,143
<i>See, this is what I'm talking about.</i>

16
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:20,743
<i>He, he has no joie de vivre.</i>

17
00:01:20,907 --> 00:01:23,979
<i>He got passed up for a promotion
and he didn't say a thing.</i>

18
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:26,707
<i>It's like he's content
being a shoe boy.</i>

19
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:28,016
<i>Shoe...?</i>

20
00:01:28,947 --> 00:01:31,507
<i>Listen, Eddie needed the job
more than I did.</i>

21
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:35,023
<i>Come on, Joel, a young buck like you
should have the world at his toes.</i>

22
00:01:35,187 --> 00:01:38,304
<i>Now, I want you to think back for me.</i>

23
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:41,459
<i>When you were a kid,
did you ever think...</i>

24
00:01:41,627 --> 00:01:46,621
<i>...that you would be handling
other people's rented shoes?</i>

25
00:01:49,147 --> 00:01:51,058
No.

26
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:54,300
<i>Not exactly, no, no.</i>

27
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:58,385
<i>But work isn't everything.</i>

28
00:01:58,547 --> 00:01:59,866
I'm happy.

29
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:01,221
I am.

30
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,901
<i>I've got the best friends in the world.</i>

31
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:06,299
<i>And I've got Debra.</i>

32
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:10,185
<i>You came here for one thing,
but I'm hearing another.</i>

33
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:12,383
<i>- Am I right, audience?
- Yeah.</i>

34
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:17,018
<i>It sounds like Joel here wants to scurry
home instead of facing the truth.</i>

35
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:19,698
<i>Yeah!</i>

36
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:24,065
<i>I think you're the one
that's crying out for help.</i>

37
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:34,096
<i>Yeah. Are you willing to see
the situation for what it is?</i>

38
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:37,145
<i>Because he ain't.
He's hiding in the shady knoll...</i>

39
00:02:37,347 --> 00:02:41,738
<i>...you know, looking for unicorns,
hoping no one finds him.</i>

40
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:47,664
<i>The point is, this relationship
is nothing but a bunch of hooey.</i>

41
00:02:48,707 --> 00:02:51,221
<i>Whoa, wait, wait up.
We came here for career advice.</i>

42
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:54,299
<i>Dagnabbit, Joel, put a cork in it.</i>

43
00:02:54,787 --> 00:02:57,779
I know this is tough for you.

44
00:02:57,947 --> 00:03:02,623
<i>But you know what you need to do,
don't you?</i>

45
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:07,380
<i>Joel...</i>

46
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,382
<i>...I think Dr. Dwayne is right.</i>

47
00:03:10,547 --> 00:03:11,616
What?

48
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:13,425
<i>I can't be with you anymore.</i>

49
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:15,305
<i>No, no.</i>

50
00:03:16,347 --> 00:03:17,939
<i>I can't be with you anymore.</i>

51
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:20,378
<i>- Isn't that great?
- Yes!</i>

52
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:21,980
<i>Wait a minute.
What is going on?</i>

53
00:03:22,147 --> 00:03:24,342
<i>You need to shape up,
is what's going on.</i>

54
00:03:24,507 --> 00:03:27,863
<i>You got a long road ahead of you,
and I am happy to say...</i>

55
00:03:28,027 --> 00:03:30,541
<i>...that you are not taking her
with you.</i>

56
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:32,380
<i>No, you're not.</i>

57
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:35,865
<i>Joel...</i>

58
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,226
<i>...I think Dr. Dwayne is right.</i>

59
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:42,660
<i>I can't be with you anymore.</i>

60
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:44,616
<i>Joel.</i>

61
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:45,936
<i>Joel.</i>

62
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:47,859
<i>- Joel.
- Joel?</i>

63
00:03:48,387 --> 00:03:50,901
<i>Joel. Joel. Joel...</i>

64
00:03:51,507 --> 00:03:52,656
<i>Seriously, dude...</i>

65
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,706
<i>...you gotta snap out of it.
This is not healthy.</i>

66
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:58,186
<i>- Hi, Ben.
- Hi, Joel.</i>

67
00:03:58,347 --> 00:04:01,100
<i>- Where'd you come from?
- I came from outside.</i>

68
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,456
Hi.

69
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:04,902
<i>For crying in the night,
have you stopped bathing?</i>

70
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:07,740
<i>You look like shit
and you smell like shit.</i>

71
00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:09,135
<i>What's the point?</i>

72
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:11,184
<i>We all die dirty.</i>

73
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:15,465
<i>All right. Well, look, that may be,
but I had my last final today.</i>

74
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:18,095
<i>My bar exam is in four months.</i>

75
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,827
<i>Right now, it's all about getting you
out of this funk.</i>

76
00:04:20,987 --> 00:04:22,136
<i>All right, home skillet?</i>

77
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:25,377
<i>Buddy, I love you.
You're my best friend.</i>

78
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:28,505
<i>I'm really sorry that Deb broke up
with you, that really sucks.</i>

79
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,225
<i>But look on the bright side, huh?</i>

80
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:33,504
<i>- I mean, it's not gonna get any worse.
- I got fired last week.</i>

81
00:04:34,147 --> 00:04:35,341
Fantastic.

82
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:39,864
<i>Mr. Wendell said I wasn't fit
to work in the bowling industry.</i>

83
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:42,382
<i>He called me an ass face.</i>

84
00:04:42,547 --> 00:04:46,699
<i>Said my face looks like an ass.</i>

85
00:04:47,907 --> 00:04:50,705
<i>Your face doesn't look like an ass.</i>

86
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:51,856
Much.

87
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:54,780
<i>From here on in,
there's nowhere to go but up.</i>

88
00:04:54,947 --> 00:04:56,346
<i>- No.
- Yes.</i>

89
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:59,101
<i>Up, up, up, there we go.
Come on, come on.</i>

90
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:02,464
<i>On your feet. On your feet.
Good God, you stink.</i>

91
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:06,415
<i>Come on now, just gonna bring you
on a little trip to the window here.</i>

92
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:08,696
<i>Yeah, huh?</i>

93
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:10,459
<i>Come on, Nosferatu.</i>

94
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:12,743
<i>Who's got an idea?
I've got a brilliant idea.</i>

95
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:15,421
<i>Let's go hop in your ride.
Take the top down, huh?</i>

96
00:05:15,587 --> 00:05:17,305
<i>Don't answer it.</i>

97
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:22,462
<i>Hi, honey, it's your mother.</i>

98
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:26,176
<i>I thought you should know that your
father took Buck ets to the dog park.</i>

99
00:05:26,347 --> 00:05:27,382
<i>Buckets.</i>

100
00:05:27,547 --> 00:05:31,062
<i>Well, there was a very aggressive
pug mix there.</i>

101
00:05:31,227 --> 00:05:34,617
<i>And your father thought they were
just humping, you know, lik e dogs do?</i>

102
00:05:34,787 --> 00:05:38,018
<i>And well, he didn't mak e it.</i>

103
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:41,145
<i>Oh, Harold.</i>

104
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,026
<i>Buckets? My Buckets?</i>

105
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:47,702
<i>Okay, okay, Joel, focus, focus.</i>

106
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:49,266
Look.

107
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:52,863
<i>Look at me, okay?
I am not gonna bullshit you anymore.</i>

108
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:56,901
<i>Today is a really, really shitty day.</i>

109
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:59,627
<i>But things are gonna turn around.</i>

110
00:05:59,787 --> 00:06:00,902
<i>I can smell it.</i>

111
00:06:03,587 --> 00:06:05,145
Wyatt?

112
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:11,539
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

113
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:15,257
<i>How many times have I applied
to the Oscar Mayer Wiener internship?</i>

114
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:17,497
<i>- Eleven.
- How many times...</i>

115
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:20,135
<i>...have I been rejected?
- Twelve.</i>

116
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:24,296
<i>That's also correct,
I did call that one time.</i>

117
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,425
<i>Whatever. To answer the question
that you haven't asked yet...</i>

118
00:06:27,947 --> 00:06:30,859
<i>...but I know you want to,
"Where has Wyatt been all week?"</i>

119
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:32,824
<i>Well, I'll tell you where he's been.</i>

120
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:36,218
<i>He's been in the process
of creating his own Wienerwagon...</i>

121
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:38,343
<i>...with every last penny in his pocket.</i>

122
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:39,860
That's right.

123
00:06:40,027 --> 00:06:41,016
<i>Wyatt's Wienerwagon.</i>

124
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:43,376
<i>- Wyatt's?
- Yes.</i>

125
00:06:43,547 --> 00:06:46,266
<i>This is an authentic,
chrome- plated, winged wiener.</i>

126
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:50,705
<i>One of only 600,000 made.</i>

127
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:53,062
<i>Can I ask a stupid question?</i>

128
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:56,695
<i>Now, why have I spent every last penny
in my pocket...</i>

129
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:59,904
<i>...on this Wienerwagon
and 12,000 frozen hot dogs?</i>

130
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:02,456
<i>It's called taking action, bitches.
Okay?</i>

131
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:07,098
<i>I will distribute hot dogs
across these great Estados Unidos...</i>

132
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:09,258
<i>...and prove that I am wiener worthy.</i>

133
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:11,782
<i>You'll drive thousands of miles
on your own dime...</i>

134
00:07:11,947 --> 00:07:15,940
<i>...to distribute wieners across these,
as you put it, great Estados Unidos...</i>

135
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:21,101
<i>...to advertise for a company that's
rejected you resoundingly 12 times.</i>

136
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:22,700
<i>Correctamundo.</i>

137
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:25,176
<i>It's a self-promotion blitzkrieg.</i>

138
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:28,862
<i>And it wouldn't be a road trip
without my two other angels.</i>

139
00:07:31,347 --> 00:07:32,496
<i>Little walkie- talkie.</i>

140
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:34,419
<i>Come on, you can be Lucy Liu.</i>

141
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,861
<i>Me?</i>

142
00:07:38,147 --> 00:07:40,263
<i>I think I'll go inside.</i>

143
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:42,825
<i>There's chips...</i>

144
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:45,938
<i>...under the La-Z-Boy.</i>

145
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:50,819
<i>Okay, bro, you go get suited up.
We blast off in 60.</i>

146
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:53,706
<i>Were you dropped as an infant?</i>

147
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:56,062
<i>Cameron Diaz would not say that
to Drew Barrymore.</i>

148
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:59,344
<i>I am not Cameron Diaz.
You are not Drew Barrymore.</i>

149
00:07:59,507 --> 00:08:01,862
<i>Joel is not Lucy Liu.</i>

150
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:05,015
<i>At least not yet.
He's going through a lot of shit.</i>

151
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:07,018
<i>Are you completely clueless?</i>

152
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,700
<i>Well, here's a clue.</i>

153
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:10,619
<i>I've mapped out our entire trip...</i>

154
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:13,779
<i>...and the final stop on the tour
is Los Angeles.</i>

155
00:08:13,947 --> 00:08:18,782
<i>When we get there, there's a certain
resident by the name of Dr. Dwayne.</i>

156
00:08:18,947 --> 00:08:20,380
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

157
00:08:20,547 --> 00:08:23,061
<i>About opening up
the largest can of whoop ass...</i>

158
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:25,502
<i>...that's ever been crizzacked.
- I got it.</i>

159
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:27,464
<i>So you wanna go kick
Dr. Dwayne's ass.</i>

160
00:08:27,627 --> 00:08:31,461
<i>No, we're gonna hold him down while
Joel beats the bejesus out of him.</i>

161
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:34,016
<i>Until he cries for his mommy.</i>

162
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:35,666
His mama.

163
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,501
<i>You've lost it.</i>

164
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:43,380
<i>Drake Hanswald.</i>

165
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:47,501
<i>And the name.</i>

166
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:49,180
<i>Drake Hanswald.</i>

167
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:51,656
<i>You're in the Gaylord Club,
you little douche.</i>

168
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:54,387
<i>And you're about
to join the Smashed Face Club.</i>

169
00:08:54,547 --> 00:08:56,060
<i>Will never pass our lips again.</i>

170
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:57,819
<i>- Dude, don't do it.
- I did it.</i>

171
00:08:57,987 --> 00:09:00,740
<i>No, no, no. No, we promised.
We made a pact.</i>

172
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:08,262
<i>- Why would you bring that up?
- Why? I'll tell you why.</i>

173
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:11,225
<i>Because he never stood up
for himself back then.</i>

174
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:13,343
<i>Never stood up for himself at all.</i>

175
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:17,261
<i>With girls, his jobs, everything.</i>

176
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:23,423
<i>Dr. Dwayne pulled a Drake Hanswald
on Joel on national television.</i>

177
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:29,538
<i>But this time, he's fighting back
like his forefathers before him.</i>

178
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:32,938
<i>You know, Lex Luthor tried
to Drake Hanswald Superman.</i>

179
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:34,222
<i>And what did Superman do?</i>

180
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:37,777
<i>Did he curl up next to a piece
of kryptonite and die? No.</i>

181
00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:40,939
<i>That crazy lady, Mrs. Teschmacher,
jumped into the pool...</i>

182
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:44,543
<i>...and took the necklace off of him
so he could fight back.</i>

183
00:09:44,707 --> 00:09:49,098
<i>We have to be that crazy lady
that take the necklace off of Joel.</i>

184
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:53,340
<i>All right, little Timmy O'Shaemus,
that's enough.</i>

185
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:55,304
<i>Here's a dollar.
Go play somewhere else.</i>

186
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:57,935
<i>Oh, jeepers. Thanks, mister.</i>

187
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:03,224
<i>So I go back to your original question.
Clueless?</i>

188
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:05,947
<i>Perhaps you meant "brilliant. "</i>

189
00:10:06,587 --> 00:10:09,147
<i>No, I didn't mean that.
You're still an idiot.</i>

190
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:12,583
<i>- Joel is never gonna agree to do this.
- Well, you leave that up to me.</i>

191
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:15,215
<i>I can persuade Joel. He trusts me.</i>

192
00:10:17,427 --> 00:10:19,099
<i>What the hell are you doing, Wyatt?</i>

193
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:22,464
<i>Relax, man, 87 percent of the time,
there's no permanent side effects.</i>

194
00:10:22,627 --> 00:10:24,026
<i>You drugged him?</i>

195
00:10:24,187 --> 00:10:27,577
<i>- Help me get his limp body into the car.
- Are you out of your...?</i>

196
00:10:27,747 --> 00:10:29,863
<i>Now, what are you two boys up to?</i>

197
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:32,905
<i>- Hi, Mrs. Harrison.
- Hey.</i>

198
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,219
<i>Something fishy's going on here.</i>

199
00:10:35,387 --> 00:10:37,343
<i>- Is that a new perfume?
- I don't smell a thing.</i>

200
00:10:37,707 --> 00:10:40,699
<i>You know what, you got a little
something on your mouth right there.</i>

201
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:44,460
<i>- Wyatt!
- Now, just breathe in. Take it in.</i>

202
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:47,460
<i>Relax, you're going to sleepybye,
sleepybye.</i>

203
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:48,696
<i>All right, don't worry.</i>

204
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:51,745
<i>She won't remember a thing.
But she might lose bladder control.</i>

205
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:54,137
<i>Wyatt, you are freaking
out of your mind, man.</i>

206
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:57,379
<i>This is not a fun trip.
This is not starting well.</i>

207
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:08,057
<i>I mean, look at him,
look at that punim.</i>

208
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:09,899
<i>He looks so peaceful.</i>

209
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:12,217
<i>He looks like somebody famous.</i>

210
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:15,664
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

211
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:17,056
<i>Got you some eggs there.</i>

212
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:18,746
<i>Might wanna eat up.</i>

213
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:20,625
<i>Gonna need your strength.</i>

214
00:11:23,627 --> 00:11:25,458
<i>Oh, that's good.</i>

215
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,259
<i>- Where are we?
- West Virginia.</i>

216
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:33,576
<i>It's for lovers.</i>

217
00:11:33,747 --> 00:11:35,544
What? What?

218
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:42,818
<i>Okay, try and follow me, Joel.</i>

219
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:45,495
<i>I can hear you fine.</i>

220
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:49,184
<i>What the hell are we doing?</i>

221
00:11:49,347 --> 00:11:51,303
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

222
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:53,345
<i>- We drugged you.
- Yeah.</i>

223
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,697
<i>We're travelling
across the country to L. A...</i>

224
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:57,937
<i>...so you can kick the crap
out of Dr. Dwayne.</i>

225
00:11:58,107 --> 00:11:59,779
<i>Dr. Dwayne?</i>

226
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:02,063
<i>I went to school with Dr. Dwayne.</i>

227
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:04,778
<i>- Really?
- Yep.</i>

228
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:07,063
<i>Said I was special in my own way.</i>

229
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:11,055
<i>You know, you're special
in your own way.</i>

230
00:12:11,227 --> 00:12:12,376
<i>Felt me up.</i>

231
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:15,345
<i>Now say,
"I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. "</i>

232
00:12:15,827 --> 00:12:18,136
<i>- Say it, " I'm cuckoo...
- I'm cuckoo...</i>

233
00:12:18,307 --> 00:12:20,741
<i>...for Cocoa Puffs. " Yeah.
... for Cocoa Puffs?</i>

234
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:23,419
<i>And then dumped me on prom night.</i>

235
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:33,905
<i>You tell him Muriel says rot in hell,
bitch.</i>

236
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,380
All right.

237
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:44,416
<i>I'll go start the car.</i>

238
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:46,817
<i>Need to look for a new job tomorrow.</i>

239
00:12:46,987 --> 00:12:49,979
<i>Worse comes to worst,
I can always go back...</i>

240
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:52,263
...to babysitting.

241
00:12:58,707 --> 00:13:01,221
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

242
00:13:01,387 --> 00:13:03,343
<i>Steady now.</i>

243
00:13:07,547 --> 00:13:09,822
<i>Probably not a good time
to mention the moustache?</i>

244
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:11,705
<i>Yeah.</i>

245
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:21,183
<i>This gravel feels like shiatsu.</i>

246
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,463
<i>Look, Joel, I...</i>

247
00:13:25,987 --> 00:13:28,706
<i>You're not a loser,
and I wasn't trying to say that.</i>

248
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,664
<i>Look, it's okay.</i>

249
00:13:30,947 --> 00:13:32,665
<i>You're right.</i>

250
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:37,862
<i>I'm 24 years old, with a college degree,
I rent out bowling shoes for a living.</i>

251
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:40,177
<i>You used to rent out bowling shoes.</i>

252
00:13:40,347 --> 00:13:43,100
<i>Who could blame Deb?
I would've dumped me too.</i>

253
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:46,062
<i>I don't even know
why you guys hang out with me.</i>

254
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:49,219
<i>I mean, when we were kids,
yeah, yeah...</i>

255
00:13:49,387 --> 00:13:52,584
<i>...I was the one on the block
with the trampoline.</i>

256
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:54,624
<i>But I don't even have that anymore.</i>

257
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:57,255
<i>My dad put it on eBay...</i>

258
00:13:57,427 --> 00:13:58,746
<i>...without even asking me.</i>

259
00:13:58,907 --> 00:14:02,582
<i>Actually, I was kind of hanging out
with you because you had Nintendo.</i>

260
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:04,226
<i>Your dad still has that, right?</i>

261
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:08,938
<i>Look, this road trip
was a really cool idea. It is. I just...</i>

262
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:12,227
<i>It's not gonna make things go back
to the way they were.</i>

263
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:14,343
<i>Buddy, it's not about going back.</i>

264
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:17,704
<i>This is about your happiness.
This is about standing up for yourself.</i>

265
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:19,095
<i>So what? Who cares, man?</i>

266
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:22,384
<i>Worst case scenario, you get
a road trip with your two best friends.</i>

267
00:14:22,547 --> 00:14:25,380
<i>Come on, buddy. Road trip?</i>

268
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:26,775
<i>Friends?</i>

269
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:29,262
<i>- Wieners.
- Wieners.</i>

270
00:14:32,227 --> 00:14:33,546
You know what?

271
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,379
<i>- Yeah, okay, let's do it.
- Really?</i>

272
00:14:35,547 --> 00:14:39,460
<i>Yeah, screw it. Let's go to L.A.
And let's put the smack on.</i>

273
00:14:39,627 --> 00:14:41,345
<i>- Well, down.
- What?</i>

274
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:44,021
<i>You don't put the smack on,
you put the smack down.</i>

275
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:46,417
It is smack down. Wyatt is right.

276
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:48,384
<i>Oh, yeah, Joel.</i>

277
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:51,186
<i>We made you look like Adolf Hitler.</i>

278
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:56,066
<i>That's pretty funny.</i>

279
00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:18,658
<i>Oh, hi. Sorry, excuse me.</i>

280
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:24,462
Damn.

281
00:15:24,627 --> 00:15:27,744
<i>Hello, pimping.</i>

282
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:29,776
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

283
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:31,744
<i>- Think I should talk to her?
- Of course.</i>

284
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:34,819
<i>- She could be the one.
- I look like an idiot, a diabetic.</i>

285
00:15:34,987 --> 00:15:38,104
<i>- You do look like an idiot, so what?
- You need to go.</i>

286
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:44,016
<i>Put it down. Put it in the van.
What're you talking about? Let's do it.</i>

287
00:15:44,947 --> 00:15:45,936
<i>- Hi.
- Hey.</i>

288
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:48,462
<i>- Check out the getaway sticks on her.
- All right.</i>

289
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:49,616
<i>Did you see that gun?</i>

290
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:56,659
<i>I'm telling you guys, Jack La Lanne
is a modern day prophet.</i>

291
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:59,859
<i>I'm gonna help you guys out
with that round tyre...</i>

292
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:04,421
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

293
00:16:29,027 --> 00:16:31,939
<i>Get that thing out of here.
Get that thing out.</i>

294
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:34,298
<i>Get that damn...</i>

295
00:17:03,227 --> 00:17:06,264
<i>You got a little something on your face
there, boys. I don't know.</i>

296
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:08,145
I don't know what it is.

297
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:14,264
<i>Janet, what in the diggity wiggity
happened to you?</i>

298
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:17,578
<i>My idiot brother shot me
with his BB gun.</i>

299
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:20,136
<i>Why would you do that, Tommy,
why?</i>

300
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,901
<i>- I was cleaning the gun and it went off.
- Whatever.</i>

301
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:24,944
<i>- It was an accident.
- No, it wasn't.</i>

302
00:17:25,107 --> 00:17:28,224
<i>Hang on, let's get our stories straight,
okay, partners?</i>

303
00:17:28,387 --> 00:17:32,505
<i>Now, Tommy, you were just sort
of cleaning your BB gun...</i>

304
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:35,261
<i>...and all of a sudden it went off
like that?</i>

305
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:40,186
<i>Like that?</i>

306
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:41,860
<i>Like that? How about that?</i>

307
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,506
<i>How about that, son? Huh?</i>

308
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:50,660
<i>All right, let me ask,
how is this all gonna go down?</i>

309
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:52,818
<i>I've never been in a fight before,
guys.</i>

310
00:17:52,987 --> 00:17:54,181
<i>No, hey, that's not true.</i>

311
00:17:54,347 --> 00:17:57,100
<i>That slap fight you had
with Adam Heiman in the third grade?</i>

312
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:59,576
<i>- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

313
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:01,817
<i>I'm pretty sure I lost that one.</i>

314
00:18:01,987 --> 00:18:03,978
<i>- Yeah.
- You put up a good fight, though.</i>

315
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:07,696
<i>His right arm was like orangutan strong
because he didn't have a left one.</i>

316
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:10,381
<i>It's true. You know, that thing
was practically bionic.</i>

317
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,536
<i>I did my best, though.</i>

318
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:15,017
<i>Seriously, sometimes I thought when
he was going to pick something up...</i>

319
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:16,745
<i>...that I could hear that:</i>

320
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:23,267
<i>Oh, good times, good times.</i>

321
00:18:23,427 --> 00:18:25,702
<i>Is it sad that the only fight
I've ever been in...</i>

322
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:27,619
<i>...was with a 7-year-old
one- armed boy?</i>

323
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:29,106
<i>- Yeah.
- Hell, yeah.</i>

324
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,817
<i>There's the exit. Fire up the hot pot.</i>

325
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:37,265
<i>We got our first stop on the tour:
Bilbo, Tennessee.</i>

326
00:18:37,427 --> 00:18:40,942
<i>Hot dogs, get your free hot dogs here.
Anybody want a hot dog?</i>

327
00:18:41,107 --> 00:18:43,416
<i>I'm giving them away free.</i>

328
00:18:43,587 --> 00:18:46,260
<i>Free means no money.</i>

329
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:53,262
<i>Come and get your free hot dog now,
better than candy.</i>

330
00:18:59,427 --> 00:19:01,782
<i>Wyatt, can we please
move on to the next town?</i>

331
00:19:01,947 --> 00:19:03,619
<i>This one is obviously dead.</i>

332
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:05,816
No.

333
00:19:05,987 --> 00:19:09,980
<i>I'm not leaving Bilbo, Tennessee,
till I give out at least one free hot dog.</i>

334
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:13,139
<i>- Folks, it's time to get up...
- I can't take the stench anymore.</i>

335
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:14,979
I'm going for a walk.

336
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:17,183
<i>Yeah, I could move around too.</i>

337
00:19:17,387 --> 00:19:19,742
<i>Hot dogs. Come on and get them.</i>

338
00:19:19,907 --> 00:19:21,659
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

339
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,057
<i>Can you handle the mob
on your own?</i>

340
00:19:29,027 --> 00:19:32,337
<i>Hot dogs. Somebody want
a free hot dog? Anyone?</i>

341
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:34,577
<i>Anybody, free hot dog.</i>

342
00:19:34,747 --> 00:19:36,385
<i>Anyone, anybody?</i>

343
00:19:36,547 --> 00:19:40,426
<i>Sir, do you want a free hot dog, sir?
Use a free hot dog?</i>

344
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:52,378
<i>Hello, sir, you want a free hot dog?</i>

345
00:19:53,987 --> 00:19:56,182
<i>What did you do to them?</i>

346
00:19:56,347 --> 00:19:59,578
<i>Nothing, sir.
It's just a free hot dog.</i>

347
00:20:00,307 --> 00:20:01,376
<i>Some kind of trick?</i>

348
00:20:02,507 --> 00:20:06,386
No. It's not a trick.

349
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,535
<i>So how old are you?</i>

350
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:13,506
<i>Twenty-four.</i>

351
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:17,345
<i>- Bring one over.
- All right.</i>

352
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:29,177
<i>Hey, did you want any mustard,
or ketchup...</i>

353
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,615
<i>Or relish, or anything like that?</i>

354
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:37,017
<i>Just the meat'll do.</i>

355
00:20:42,547 --> 00:20:43,616
<i>All right, here.</i>

356
00:20:43,787 --> 00:20:45,584
<i>Try this, see how you like...</i>

357
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:47,985
<i>Wait a second.</i>

358
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:55,462
Not bad.

359
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:00,337
<i>Pretty quiet out here today.</i>

360
00:21:00,507 --> 00:21:03,579
<i>We must be the only two people
out here for miles.</i>

361
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:05,419
<i>Just me...</i>

362
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:07,259
...and you.

363
00:21:10,627 --> 00:21:12,219
<i>My friends just went for a walk.</i>

364
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:15,220
<i>You know, they'll probably be back
any minute.</i>

365
00:21:16,027 --> 00:21:19,019
<i>You smell like beef and sweat.</i>

366
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:22,542
<i>Probably a short walk.
They gonna... Coming...</i>

367
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:24,777
<i>Hush, now.</i>

368
00:21:24,947 --> 00:21:27,097
<i>Let me take you away from all this.</i>

369
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:29,223
I wanna stay.

370
00:21:36,787 --> 00:21:39,699
<i>Kierkegaard, schmierkegaard.
The guy's a...</i>

371
00:21:40,147 --> 00:21:41,944
<i>Get in the van!</i>

372
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,098
<i>- Get in the van. Get in the van!
- What?</i>

373
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:46,019
<i>- Wyatt, calm...
- Get in the van now!</i>

374
00:21:46,187 --> 00:21:48,576
<i>I will leave you!
Get in the van right now, let's go!</i>

375
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:50,499
<i>Man, let's go.</i>

376
00:21:58,667 --> 00:21:59,656
<i>- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey.</i>

377
00:21:59,827 --> 00:22:01,499
<i>- Calm down, calm down.
- Wyatt, Wyatt.</i>

378
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,783
<i>- Buddy, what happened?
- Nothing.</i>

379
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,858
<i>- Nothing happened.
- Okay, nothing happened.</i>

380
00:22:06,027 --> 00:22:07,779
- What is wrong with you?
- What's wrong?

381
00:22:07,947 --> 00:22:11,144
<i>What would be wrong with you if
some guy was sucking on your finger?</i>

382
00:22:11,307 --> 00:22:12,820
<i>Dude, what are you talking about?</i>

383
00:22:12,987 --> 00:22:17,026
I'm talking about cowboy boots
and man-gina.

384
00:22:17,187 --> 00:22:19,462
<i>One minute, I was giving him
a free hot dog...</i>

385
00:22:19,627 --> 00:22:23,336
<i>...and the next thing I know,
he had my finger in his mouth.</i>

386
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:25,463
I don't wanna talk about it.

387
00:22:26,227 --> 00:22:28,661
<i>Buddy, that's...
You're fine, that's cool.</i>

388
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:31,295
<i>- Settle down, it's perfectly normal.
- Really?</i>

389
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:32,456
<i>Yeah.</i>

390
00:22:32,627 --> 00:22:35,664
<i>Just forget about it, forget about it.
You're fine. You're fine.</i>

391
00:22:35,827 --> 00:22:38,739
<i>- We're fine.
- He's fine. We're fine, you're fine.</i>

392
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:40,977
<i>- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, right?
- Yeah.</i>

393
00:22:41,147 --> 00:22:42,944
<i>Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.</i>

394
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,386
<i>Yeah.</i>

395
00:22:46,627 --> 00:22:48,265
<i>- Oh, hey, Ben.
- Yes, my friend.</i>

396
00:22:48,427 --> 00:22:51,419
<i>I was thinking, Kentucky Fried Chicken
for lunch.</i>

397
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:52,861
<i>- That's a good one.
- Yes.</i>

398
00:22:53,027 --> 00:22:54,346
<i>I could go for good chicken.</i>

399
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:56,463
<i>I'm picking up
what you're laying down.</i>

400
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:59,699
<i>You know, I might even go so far
as to say...</i>

401
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:01,823
<i>...that it's finger- licking good.
- Yeah.</i>

402
00:23:01,987 --> 00:23:03,340
<i>You guys are assholes.</i>

403
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,463
<i>A guy sucked on your finger?</i>

404
00:23:05,627 --> 00:23:09,063
<i>Yeah, like your dad used to suck
on your balls.</i>

405
00:23:09,947 --> 00:23:14,065
<i>Masturbating in an elevator?
Ding-ding, going down.</i>

406
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:15,746
<i>How about that?</i>

407
00:23:19,787 --> 00:23:23,336
<i>- Hey. Hey, what's going on?
- Hey, just relaxing.</i>

408
00:23:23,547 --> 00:23:27,017
<i>- Where the hell's Wyatt?
- Washing his finger. Still.</i>

409
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:31,262
<i>Get up, get dressed. We're going out.
I scoped out this place down the street.</i>

410
00:23:31,427 --> 00:23:35,500
<i>- I'm watching something.
- Oh, oh, TV, well, that's not bad.</i>

411
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,976
<i>Well, what's on, let me see?
Those are the channels...</i>

412
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:39,580
<i>Oh, I accidentally turned it off.</i>

413
00:23:39,747 --> 00:23:42,420
<i>We're going to the bar.
It'll be good therapy for you.</i>

414
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,055
<i>You can get drunk
and talk about your feelings.</i>

415
00:23:45,227 --> 00:23:47,502
I don't know. L...

416
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:50,295
I go through ups and downs.

417
00:23:50,827 --> 00:23:52,499
<i>I guess...</i>

418
00:23:52,787 --> 00:23:54,539
...you know...

419
00:23:55,987 --> 00:23:57,898
<i>...maybe I loved her.</i>

420
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:02,661
<i>I know it sounds cliché, but I...</i>

421
00:24:02,987 --> 00:24:05,376
<i>I feel empty on the inside.</i>

422
00:24:06,587 --> 00:24:07,861
<i>It's like I'm hollow.</i>

423
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:11,420
<i>Oh, honey, do you wanna put
your face in my boobs again?</i>

424
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,459
<i>I guess.</i>

425
00:24:24,227 --> 00:24:27,105
<i>I don't know, buddy,
is this really helping Joel?</i>

426
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:28,939
<i>You smell great.</i>

427
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:32,456
<i>Yeah, this was definitely a good call.</i>

428
00:24:32,627 --> 00:24:34,185
<i>Oh, time expired already, baby?</i>

429
00:24:34,387 --> 00:24:35,786
<i>Well...</i>

430
00:24:35,947 --> 00:24:38,415
<i>...let's feed that meter.</i>

431
00:24:48,627 --> 00:24:50,504
<i>You forgot one.</i>

432
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:53,506
<i>You guys, I'm cold.</i>

433
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:55,339
<i>Can't we put the comforter on?</i>

434
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:58,658
<i>No, man, haven't you seen those
20/20 episodes?</i>

435
00:24:58,827 --> 00:25:01,819
<i>I'm not cuddling up
next to someone else's jiz.</i>

436
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:04,182
<i>Too late for that, dude.</i>

437
00:25:16,907 --> 00:25:18,704
<i>You're an idiot.</i>

438
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:21,256
<i>Would you both please shut up?</i>

439
00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:26,459
<i>- Good night, Ben.
- Good night, Wyatt.</i>

440
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:29,187
<i>- Good night, Joel.
- Good night, Wyatt.</i>

441
00:25:29,347 --> 00:25:33,386
<i>Good night killers of Arkansas,
lurking outside our window.</i>

442
00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:35,219
Damn.

443
00:25:39,547 --> 00:25:41,538
<i>I'm sleeping in the van.</i>

444
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:06,060
<i>What the...?</i>

445
00:26:09,747 --> 00:26:11,942
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

446
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:15,781
<i>Welcome to Tofu Town, boys.</i>

447
00:26:41,827 --> 00:26:44,022
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

448
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:47,224
<i>That's frigging defamation of character
right there.</i>

449
00:26:47,387 --> 00:26:48,820
That is disgusting.

450
00:26:48,987 --> 00:26:52,184
<i>That is the sexiest loogie
ever hawked.</i>

451
00:26:52,347 --> 00:26:53,860
What?

452
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:58,066
<i>- She was hot.
- Dude, it was like her mouth ejaculated.</i>

453
00:26:58,387 --> 00:27:02,096
<i>- I know.
- She's gonna get out here and clean it.</i>

454
00:27:02,267 --> 00:27:03,541
<i>Come on.</i>

455
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:06,380
<i>Let's be honest, she probably
didn't even know she did it.</i>

456
00:27:06,547 --> 00:27:09,744
<i>She probably didn't even notice.
Maybe she was coughing, I don't know.</i>

457
00:27:09,907 --> 00:27:11,625
<i>I know people have that problem.</i>

458
00:27:11,787 --> 00:27:14,665
<i>I've been hit in the face before.
There's nothing you can do...</i>

459
00:27:14,827 --> 00:27:16,545
<i>No, no, no,
that loogie had a purpose.</i>

460
00:27:16,707 --> 00:27:18,265
<i>Dude.</i>

461
00:27:18,507 --> 00:27:21,021
<i>Dude, dudes, wait a minute.
This is perfect.</i>

462
00:27:21,187 --> 00:27:23,257
<i>The loogie cementing itself
to my windshield?</i>

463
00:27:23,427 --> 00:27:24,542
<i>No, no, Wyatt.</i>

464
00:27:24,707 --> 00:27:27,779
<i>This is a perfect practise run
for Joely.</i>

465
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,262
<i>- No.
- Yes.</i>

466
00:27:30,427 --> 00:27:32,338
<i>Hell yes, buddy.
You're gonna get in there.</i>

467
00:27:32,507 --> 00:27:35,658
<i>You're gonna confront those hippies
head on. Head on, baby.</i>

468
00:27:35,827 --> 00:27:37,818
<i>What are they gonna do,
hug you to death?</i>

469
00:27:37,987 --> 00:27:39,978
<i>- This is a perfect first step.
- Yes.</i>

470
00:27:40,147 --> 00:27:42,058
<i>Come on, you go in there
and you tell them.</i>

471
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:45,139
<i>They don't clean that stuff off,
you'll go psycho on their shit.</i>

472
00:27:45,307 --> 00:27:46,820
<i>Psycho on their shit.</i>

473
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:49,706
<i>No, I'm not going psycho
on anybody's shit.</i>

474
00:27:49,867 --> 00:27:51,539
<i>You're so frigging lame.</i>

475
00:27:51,707 --> 00:27:54,301
<i>Let me show you how it's done.
Lesson number one.</i>

476
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:57,698
<i>It all starts when I get up
and make eye contact.</i>

477
00:27:57,867 --> 00:27:59,858
<i>I rise.</i>

478
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:03,464
<i>I shift into attack mode.</i>

479
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,381
And now...

480
00:28:09,547 --> 00:28:10,775
<i>...we dance.</i>

481
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:15,456
<i>Hey, bitches.</i>

482
00:28:16,147 --> 00:28:18,263
<i>Bitches, huh?
Well, this should be fun.</i>

483
00:28:18,427 --> 00:28:21,225
<i>I think you might've left something
on my windshield.</i>

484
00:28:21,387 --> 00:28:23,662
<i>Oh, yeah. It's a loogie.</i>

485
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:24,816
I know what it is.

486
00:28:24,987 --> 00:28:26,978
<i>Do you also know that big hunk
of flesh...</i>

487
00:28:27,147 --> 00:28:29,058
<i>...with your bright smiley face on it...</i>

488
00:28:29,227 --> 00:28:32,424
<i>...promotes the violent death of
innocent animals everywhere you go?</i>

489
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:35,340
<i>What're you doing but driving around
in a big giant sponge...</i>

490
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:38,419
<i>It's tofu. It's a soy-based
meat alternative, hello.</i>

491
00:28:38,587 --> 00:28:40,942
<i>Oh, well, hot dogs are meat-based
soy alternatives.</i>

492
00:28:41,107 --> 00:28:42,984
<i>How you like me now...?</i>

493
00:28:44,867 --> 00:28:47,176
<i>You better go back over
to your cavemen friends...</i>

494
00:28:47,347 --> 00:28:49,941
<i>...before I hawk another one
in your face.</i>

495
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:51,978
<i>Easy chief. We can handle this.</i>

496
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:55,901
<i>Okay, so it sounds to me like,
number one, you're not apologising.</i>

497
00:28:56,107 --> 00:28:58,826
<i>Two, you're not gonna
clean that thing of my windshield?</i>

498
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,136
<i>A for the weenie guy.</i>

499
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:03,743
<i>Sarcasm. That's how it's gonna be?
Well, let me tell you how I'm gonna be.</i>

500
00:29:03,907 --> 00:29:05,420
<i>Full of meat.</i>

501
00:29:06,907 --> 00:29:09,102
<i>You know what,
you won't be needing this.</i>

502
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:11,064
<i>Steak sauce, you don't need that.</i>

503
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:13,138
<i>What, you gonna put steak sauce
on tofu?</i>

504
00:29:13,307 --> 00:29:15,025
<i>It ain't steak.</i>

505
00:29:19,987 --> 00:29:21,625
<i>So how did that go, chief?</i>

506
00:29:21,787 --> 00:29:24,665
<i>Well, you know, I said what I needed
to say when I said it.</i>

507
00:29:24,827 --> 00:29:27,182
<i>To establish authority, you dig?</i>

508
00:29:27,347 --> 00:29:30,066
<i>They'll think twice about messing
with us again, thank you.</i>

509
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:34,106
<i>No. One, two, three, four, five. No.
One, two, three, four, five.</i>

510
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:36,576
<i>No, oh, it's gone.</i>

511
00:29:36,747 --> 00:29:38,578
<i>Oh, it's definitely gone.</i>

512
00:29:38,747 --> 00:29:41,022
<i>My hood ornament, man...</i>

513
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:42,536
<i>Oh, wait a second.</i>

514
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:47,625
<i>You guys are funny guys.
You took my winged wiener.</i>

515
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:51,466
<i>Please...</i>

516
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,504
<i>...tell me it was you.</i>

517
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:58,536
<i>I am going to kill every bone
in those hippies' bodies.</i>

518
00:29:58,707 --> 00:30:00,743
<i>Yeah, you can't really kill a bone,
dude.</i>

519
00:30:00,907 --> 00:30:03,501
<i>Without that hood ornament,
my vehicle isn't regulation.</i>

520
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:06,056
<i>- I could get fired.
- You don't work for the company.</i>

521
00:30:06,227 --> 00:30:08,297
<i>Not the point.
I need my hood ornament, man.</i>

522
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:11,027
<i>- Are you feeling me?
- Could be anywhere by now.</i>

523
00:30:11,187 --> 00:30:14,463
<i>Man, I have seen it all.
A gigantic hot dog.</i>

524
00:30:14,627 --> 00:30:16,106
<i>- What are you eating?
- Bean curd.</i>

525
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:18,781
<i>Hippies in a big sponge
giving this stuff out for free.</i>

526
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:22,223
<i>- What do I do to get a free hot dog?
- Focus. Where's the sponge?</i>

527
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,945
Took off down that dirt road.

528
00:30:24,107 --> 00:30:25,096
<i>Get in, get in.</i>

529
00:30:25,267 --> 00:30:28,782
<i>I'm going, I'm going, I'm getting in.
I'm getting in.</i>

530
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:32,500
<i>You mean, I don't get
my free hot dog?</i>

531
00:30:36,107 --> 00:30:38,018
<i>- Oh, there they are.
- Wyatt, slow it down.</i>

532
00:30:38,187 --> 00:30:40,018
<i>- This thing was built for speed.
- Really?</i>

533
00:30:40,187 --> 00:30:42,064
<i>A giant hot dog built for speed?</i>

534
00:30:42,227 --> 00:30:43,865
Holy shit.

535
00:30:44,027 --> 00:30:46,336
- What...? What is that?
- That's nothing.

536
00:30:46,507 --> 00:30:47,576
<i>Help me.</i>

537
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:50,539
<i>They're dragging my...</i>

538
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:54,905
<i>Wyatt, Wyatt.</i>

539
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:57,464
<i>Slow this thing down, man,
I'm serious.</i>

540
00:30:57,627 --> 00:31:00,744
<i>I've got some major pucker factor
going on right now.</i>

541
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:03,338
<i>Take your foot
off the accelerator now.</i>

542
00:31:03,507 --> 00:31:05,737
<i>- You take it...
- They're just right over...</i>

543
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:09,343
<i>I did not go on this trip to be spinning
around in a giant hot dog.</i>

544
00:31:18,427 --> 00:31:20,702
<i>Oh, look at my baby.</i>

545
00:31:20,907 --> 00:31:22,056
<i>Oh, look at this.</i>

546
00:31:22,227 --> 00:31:24,741
<i>No wonder I've been rejected
11 times.</i>

547
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:27,944
<i>Hey, hey, it's totally fixable.</i>

548
00:31:28,107 --> 00:31:29,745
<i>Glue's come a long way.</i>

549
00:31:29,947 --> 00:31:32,461
<i>Joel. Joel, look at this, is it...?
Am I bleeding?</i>

550
00:31:32,627 --> 00:31:35,824
<i>- Dude, it's just a bump.
- Oh, yeah? You are such an idiot.</i>

551
00:31:35,987 --> 00:31:37,386
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

552
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:40,220
<i>- Guys, come on.
- No. No, Joel, he's a moron.</i>

553
00:31:40,387 --> 00:31:42,821
<i>He acts like an idiot
and we have to pay the price.</i>

554
00:31:42,987 --> 00:31:46,662
<i>That's why your nose is gushing blood,
and I've got a lump on my head.</i>

555
00:31:46,827 --> 00:31:49,261
<i>- Your entire head is a lump.
- I'm done talking to you.</i>

556
00:31:49,427 --> 00:31:51,657
<i>I'm done talking to you
for the rest of the trip.</i>

557
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:53,619
<i>I already started.</i>

558
00:31:56,827 --> 00:31:58,943
<i>- Look at this.
- Stupid wiener.</i>

559
00:32:01,307 --> 00:32:03,616
<i>Remember when Ian Rosenbluth...</i>

560
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:07,700
<i>...would wedge the chalk into the
eraser in Doc Summergrad's class?</i>

561
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:10,984
<i>And every time Summergrad would
go to the board and try to erase...</i>

562
00:32:11,147 --> 00:32:14,583
<i>...he'd get that fatty streak of chalk?
It was amazing.</i>

563
00:32:14,747 --> 00:32:17,215
<i>That kid was great.
Oh, my God.</i>

564
00:32:17,387 --> 00:32:19,298
<i>Lan Rosenbluth, he's a genius.</i>

565
00:32:20,867 --> 00:32:23,586
<i>Oh, did you...? Did you see that sign?
Did you see that?</i>

566
00:32:23,747 --> 00:32:27,535
<i>That's a sign. That's a sign,
that's what this trip is all about.</i>

567
00:32:27,707 --> 00:32:31,063
<i>My best friends
helping me take a stand.</i>

568
00:32:31,227 --> 00:32:34,060
<i>Hey, and look at me.
You know, look at me, it's working.</i>

569
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:37,426
<i>I'm not scared of that.
I wasn't scared of that at all.</i>

570
00:32:37,587 --> 00:32:39,896
<i>Punch that poster in the face.
Turn around.</i>

571
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:42,376
<i>Turn around, I wanna punch
that poster in the face.</i>

572
00:32:42,547 --> 00:32:44,344
What do you guys think of that?

573
00:32:44,507 --> 00:32:47,863
<i>Come on, I wanna hear your thoughts.
I'm listening now.</i>

574
00:33:27,587 --> 00:33:30,420
Nothing? Nothing at all?

575
00:33:30,587 --> 00:33:33,545
<i>I will hurl my body out of this car,
I swear to God, I mean it.</i>

576
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:37,859
<i>- I've always wanted to do it.
- Hey. All right, all right, dude, stop.</i>

577
00:33:38,027 --> 00:33:39,745
<i>Close the door.</i>

578
00:33:44,187 --> 00:33:46,576
<i>- Say something to Ben, Wyatt.
- Why I gotta go first?</i>

579
00:33:46,747 --> 00:33:49,307
<i>- Oh, God, Wyatt.
- Oh, God, Ben.</i>

580
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,181
<i>Apologise, please.</i>

581
00:33:55,787 --> 00:34:00,258
<i>I'm sorry that I called you
a moron and an idiot.</i>

582
00:34:00,427 --> 00:34:04,340
<i>Thank you.
I'm sorry I said your head was a lump.</i>

583
00:34:04,507 --> 00:34:06,259
Thank you.

584
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:11,779
<i>Didn't even ask for that.
That was great, that was good.</i>

585
00:34:13,947 --> 00:34:16,859
<i>What the...? Hey, what do you say...</i>

586
00:34:17,027 --> 00:34:20,178
<i>...we go rediscover friendship?</i>

587
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:35,337
<i>Come on, let me get a lollipop.</i>

588
00:35:36,987 --> 00:35:38,215
<i>Hey.</i>

589
00:35:46,627 --> 00:35:49,380
<i>You're not so happy anymore,
are you?</i>

590
00:35:58,507 --> 00:36:00,498
<i>Boobies!</i>

591
00:36:00,747 --> 00:36:03,022
<i>What planet are you from, Cody?</i>

592
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:11,019
<i>Do you see what I am dealing with,
Dr. Dwayne?</i>

593
00:36:11,187 --> 00:36:13,462
<i>I mean, his teachers think
he's a mental case.</i>

594
00:36:13,627 --> 00:36:16,744
<i>Liz Anne, help is on the way,
my friend.</i>

595
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:20,582
<i>Just for you,
a copy of my latest and greatest:</i>

596
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:25,025
<i>Earth to Mom, What to do
When Your Kid Thinks He's an Alien.</i>

597
00:36:25,187 --> 00:36:29,783
<i>And if all else fails, you can use it
to knock something loose.</i>

598
00:36:32,387 --> 00:36:34,059
<i>"Cloozy, cleazy, clucky" that.</i>

599
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,058
Buy my book.

600
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:55,587
<i>Hey, hey, hey.
Everybody calm down, calm down.</i>

601
00:36:58,067 --> 00:36:59,659
<i>All right, who needs a napkin?</i>

602
00:37:14,227 --> 00:37:15,626
<i>You make me wanna scream...</i>

603
00:37:15,787 --> 00:37:17,345
...and pull my hair out
and just go:

604
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:28,266
<i>I'll take one.</i>

605
00:37:40,387 --> 00:37:43,379
<i>I got a peanut butter dog.
Do you want one of those?</i>

606
00:37:43,547 --> 00:37:45,139
Got it right.

607
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:48,140
<i>Don't forget. Wyatt's Wieners,
you can't beat them.</i>

608
00:38:03,427 --> 00:38:06,021
<i>- We did real good today, guys.
- I'm pretty happy.</i>

609
00:38:06,187 --> 00:38:09,259
<i>Man, this day
could not get any better.</i>

610
00:38:09,427 --> 00:38:11,338
<i>Hi, boys.</i>

611
00:38:11,627 --> 00:38:13,106
<i>Can we have a hot dog?</i>

612
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:14,905
<i>You know, I don't know if we have...</i>

613
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:17,183
<i>You know, we have three left,
actually.</i>

614
00:38:17,347 --> 00:38:20,305
<i>- Perfect.
- Yes, you are.</i>

615
00:38:22,427 --> 00:38:24,304
<i>Why are you guys so wet?</i>

616
00:38:24,467 --> 00:38:27,504
<i>Well, we all got dumped yesterday
by our boyfriends.</i>

617
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:31,262
<i>What better way to get over things
than to go on the log flume.</i>

618
00:38:31,427 --> 00:38:34,180
<i>That is such an awesome plan.</i>

619
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:36,863
<i>We also wanted to make out
with some guys...</i>

620
00:38:37,027 --> 00:38:39,495
<i>...so we could feel better
about ourselves.</i>

621
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,737
<i>Would you guys be okay with that?</i>

622
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:47,295
<i>- One second.
- Yeah, just one minute.</i>

623
00:38:48,867 --> 00:38:51,586
<i>We accept your offer. Begin.</i>

624
00:39:22,267 --> 00:39:24,303
<i>You want your gum back?
Because...</i>

625
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:26,537
<i>I'll keep it.</i>

626
00:39:39,507 --> 00:39:41,543
<i>Bless you.</i>

627
00:39:45,507 --> 00:39:47,782
<i>Wet girls.</i>

628
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:51,817
<i>All right, boys, we should be
in Flaglestown by 8.</i>

629
00:39:52,227 --> 00:39:55,185
<i>Not if you continue to drive 30
miles an hour, man. Come on.</i>

630
00:39:57,947 --> 00:40:00,381
<i>- Move your wiener.
- That's illegal.</i>

631
00:40:00,547 --> 00:40:02,981
<i>Hey. Tuck your ass in, old lady.</i>

632
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:06,141
<i>Wyatt, why are old people passing us?
What is going on?</i>

633
00:40:06,307 --> 00:40:09,458
<i>I don't know. The pedal
must be busted. I'm flooring it.</i>

634
00:40:09,627 --> 00:40:12,266
<i>Could it be that your gas tank
is on empty?</i>

635
00:40:13,067 --> 00:40:14,580
Crap.

636
00:40:17,787 --> 00:40:19,425
<i>Hey, slow up there... Jesus Christ.</i>

637
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:21,942
<i>All right, all right, all right.</i>

638
00:40:22,107 --> 00:40:23,665
<i>Come on, witch...</i>

639
00:40:24,827 --> 00:40:26,818
<i>Hey, lady.</i>

640
00:40:33,747 --> 00:40:36,307
<i>Hey. Gotta stop.</i>

641
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:40,016
<i>Come on... This is bullshit.</i>

642
00:40:40,747 --> 00:40:43,545
<i>Calm down,
you're gonna hurt yourself.</i>

643
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:44,901
<i>Hey, we got an RV, boys.</i>

644
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,342
<i>What makes you think
an RV is gonna pick us up?</i>

645
00:40:47,507 --> 00:40:49,225
<i>Come on, man, we surrender.</i>

646
00:40:50,467 --> 00:40:52,264
<i>Hey, he's stopping.</i>

647
00:40:52,427 --> 00:40:54,224
<i>He's stopping, come on.</i>

648
00:40:55,267 --> 00:40:56,700
<i>He's stopping.</i>

649
00:40:56,867 --> 00:40:58,459
<i>Hey, he's stopping.</i>

650
00:40:58,627 --> 00:41:00,140
<i>- Oh, man.
- He's stopping.</i>

651
00:41:00,307 --> 00:41:02,377
<i>He's stopping.</i>

652
00:41:03,187 --> 00:41:05,576
<i>I'm Felicia Applebaum,
and that's my husband Frank.</i>

653
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:07,146
<i>- Oh, I'm Wyatt.
- I'm Ben.</i>

654
00:41:07,307 --> 00:41:08,820
<i>I'm Joel.</i>

655
00:41:12,027 --> 00:41:13,460
<i>Hey, this is nice.</i>

656
00:41:13,627 --> 00:41:16,699
<i>Hey, it's just like having the kids
in the car again.</i>

657
00:41:16,867 --> 00:41:18,858
<i>No, we just really appreciate
the ride.</i>

658
00:41:19,027 --> 00:41:21,939
<i>- Don't worry about it.
- Oh, nonsense. Happy we can help out.</i>

659
00:41:22,107 --> 00:41:23,938
<i>So where are you guys from?</i>

660
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,938
<i>- From Chitown, Joel.
- Chicago.</i>

661
00:41:26,107 --> 00:41:28,177
<i>- The Windy City.
- Cool.</i>

662
00:41:28,347 --> 00:41:31,862
<i>But now we are just touring
God's green earth.</i>

663
00:41:32,027 --> 00:41:33,346
<i>It's the life, boys.</i>

664
00:41:33,507 --> 00:41:36,579
<i>No commitments, we go wherever
we want, whenever we want.</i>

665
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:37,896
<i>- That's awesome.
- Yeah.</i>

666
00:41:38,067 --> 00:41:39,102
Cool.

667
00:41:39,267 --> 00:41:41,986
<i>Me and the missus, we've made
love in 34 states.</i>

668
00:41:43,907 --> 00:41:46,626
<i>We're driving along,
we get a hankering, we pull over...</i>

669
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:49,426
<i>...right there in the back seat,
where you're sitting.</i>

670
00:41:49,587 --> 00:41:51,737
<i>Might be some stains back there.</i>

671
00:41:51,907 --> 00:41:53,420
<i>- I cleaned them.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

672
00:41:53,587 --> 00:41:56,226
<i>We collected a decal
from every state we've made it in.</i>

673
00:41:56,387 --> 00:41:59,857
<i>Yeah, we got decals from 34 states,
and the District of Columbia.</i>

674
00:42:00,867 --> 00:42:04,143
<i>The Washington Monument,
sticking straight up in the air?</i>

675
00:42:05,027 --> 00:42:07,587
<i>Hey, those tourists'll never forget it.</i>

676
00:42:09,987 --> 00:42:11,056
<i>Are you guys hungry?</i>

677
00:42:11,227 --> 00:42:13,900
<i>Oh, I've got some trail mix, okay.</i>

678
00:42:14,067 --> 00:42:18,902
<i>And I've got some homemade
dried apricots.</i>

679
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:21,581
<i>Frank here bought me a dehydrator
for our anniversary.</i>

680
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:22,736
<i>- Just the one.
- Okay.</i>

681
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:26,058
- Okay.
- Thanks.

682
00:42:30,387 --> 00:42:31,945
<i>Who wants a treat?</i>

683
00:42:32,107 --> 00:42:33,586
<i>Who's a good girl? Yes, she is.</i>

684
00:42:33,747 --> 00:42:35,658
<i>Who's a good girl? Yes, she is.</i>

685
00:42:35,827 --> 00:42:37,704
<i>Give Daddy a kiss.</i>

686
00:42:39,907 --> 00:42:42,660
<i>Down, girl, down. Down.
It's okay.</i>

687
00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:45,136
<i>Daddy'll give you a bone later.</i>

688
00:42:45,907 --> 00:42:48,705
<i>Oh, yeah, the kids loved that one.</i>

689
00:42:49,307 --> 00:42:50,899
<i>How many kids do you have?</i>

690
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:53,023
<i>Three boys. Three tigers.</i>

691
00:42:53,187 --> 00:42:55,417
<i>Yes, sir, they know their way
around the ladies.</i>

692
00:42:55,587 --> 00:42:59,182
<i>Yeah, our oldest, Carl, he lost
his virginity when he was 16.</i>

693
00:42:59,347 --> 00:43:01,417
<i>- Back of a Chevy.
- No, honey, that was Bob.</i>

694
00:43:01,587 --> 00:43:04,340
<i>Carl was down in the basement
on top of the dirty clothes.</i>

695
00:43:04,507 --> 00:43:07,419
<i>Oh, yeah. Jesus, screaming,
all that noise.</i>

696
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:10,863
<i>- I thought the cat was in heat.
- Oh, I know. We don't have a cat.</i>

697
00:43:14,307 --> 00:43:17,105
<i>So have you guys
been to the festival before?</i>

698
00:43:17,267 --> 00:43:19,337
<i>No, I've never been to Flaglestown.</i>

699
00:43:19,507 --> 00:43:21,259
<i>Yeah, us too. Us too, us too.</i>

700
00:43:21,867 --> 00:43:24,540
<i>Virgin territory for me
and my freaky-deaky.</i>

701
00:43:24,707 --> 00:43:26,937
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

702
00:43:27,587 --> 00:43:29,737
<i>- Yes.
- We might have to christen it?</i>

703
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:31,863
<i>- I hope so. I'm so ready.
- Ready?</i>

704
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:33,346
- Right now.
- All right.

705
00:43:33,507 --> 00:43:35,896
<i>- Somebody grab the wheel.
- No! No, no, no!</i>

706
00:43:36,507 --> 00:43:38,782
<i>Oh, I'm watching old people do it.</i>

707
00:43:58,587 --> 00:44:02,023
<i>And again, you have our number
if you need a place to crash.</i>

708
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:04,099
<i>Hey, hey, but be prepared.</i>

709
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,735
<i>There might be da noise
and or da funk...</i>

710
00:44:06,907 --> 00:44:08,625
<i>...being brought in tonight.</i>

711
00:44:08,787 --> 00:44:11,699
<i>Look at you, you are so hip.</i>

712
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:18,936
<i>Oh, wait, hey, you got some of
my soft serve on your chin there.</i>

713
00:44:19,107 --> 00:44:21,416
<i>You're so sweet, you're so sweet.
Bye.</i>

714
00:44:26,387 --> 00:44:28,343
I'm a lucky guy.

715
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,544
<i>I mean, you know...</i>

716
00:44:45,707 --> 00:44:48,016
<i>...at least we got a place to crash.</i>

717
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:50,705
<i>Are you nuts?</i>

718
00:44:50,867 --> 00:44:53,222
<i>That was the most disgusting thing
I've ever seen.</i>

719
00:44:53,387 --> 00:44:54,376
<i>Really?</i>

720
00:44:54,547 --> 00:44:57,141
<i>Even more disgusting
than that time we caught your dad...</i>

721
00:44:57,307 --> 00:44:59,696
<i>...in the tub tugging his myagi?
- He was scratching.</i>

722
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:01,698
<i>Didn't know you could
scratch like this.</i>

723
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:03,095
Shut up.

724
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:06,065
<i>We agreed that he was...</i>

725
00:45:09,587 --> 00:45:11,976
<i>Dude, do you have my wallet?</i>

726
00:45:12,147 --> 00:45:15,219
<i>What's that, a black thing?
I ain't got your wallet.</i>

727
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:17,822
<i>- You got my wallet?
- No.</i>

728
00:45:18,387 --> 00:45:20,059
<i>Hey, barfy.</i>

729
00:45:20,867 --> 00:45:22,619
<i>Do you have our wallets?</i>

730
00:45:23,107 --> 00:45:24,460
<i>Oh, man, what...?</i>

731
00:45:24,627 --> 00:45:27,619
<i>No, no. Hey.
No, don't bother, don't bother.</i>

732
00:45:27,787 --> 00:45:29,539
<i>What the hell?</i>

733
00:45:31,587 --> 00:45:32,622
<i>Wet girls.</i>

734
00:45:33,027 --> 00:45:35,018
<i>We accept your offer. Begin.</i>

735
00:45:51,787 --> 00:45:53,140
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

736
00:45:53,507 --> 00:45:56,897
<i>I am gonna find those wet bitches
if it's the last thing I do.</i>

737
00:45:57,067 --> 00:45:58,182
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

738
00:45:58,347 --> 00:45:59,860
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

739
00:46:00,027 --> 00:46:01,745
<i>How are you gonna go
about doing that?</i>

740
00:46:02,307 --> 00:46:03,296
<i>I gotta pee.</i>

741
00:46:03,467 --> 00:46:05,822
<i>I'll drive across this state
50 times if I have to.</i>

742
00:46:05,987 --> 00:46:07,784
<i>Really? We need
to make money tonight.</i>

743
00:46:07,947 --> 00:46:10,381
<i>Instead of giving out hot dogs,
we're selling them.</i>

744
00:46:10,547 --> 00:46:12,936
<i>- No. I took an oath.
- You didn't take an oath, retard.</i>

745
00:46:13,107 --> 00:46:15,575
<i>I did take an oath,
with myself, oka...?</i>

746
00:46:15,747 --> 00:46:17,624
<i>You don't know everything.</i>

747
00:46:18,187 --> 00:46:19,745
<i>Okay, what's your great idea?</i>

748
00:46:23,707 --> 00:46:26,175
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

749
00:46:30,547 --> 00:46:32,378
<i>Hey, Timmy O'Shaemus?</i>

750
00:46:32,547 --> 00:46:34,583
<i>Don't you live down the block?</i>

751
00:46:34,747 --> 00:46:36,226
<i>I go where I'm needed, mister.</i>

752
00:46:36,387 --> 00:46:37,456
<i>That's great.</i>

753
00:46:37,627 --> 00:46:41,222
<i>- Can you spare some change?
- Oh, Timmy, my wallet...</i>

754
00:46:41,387 --> 00:46:43,582
<i>- I am strapped for cash.
- You're a real douche.</i>

755
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:45,738
<i>And you have a small dick.</i>

756
00:46:48,027 --> 00:46:49,506
<i>What the...?</i>

757
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,059
Timmy?

758
00:46:52,827 --> 00:46:55,057
<i>- I told you what the plan is.
- No, you didn't.</i>

759
00:46:55,227 --> 00:46:56,785
<i>- Yes, I did.
- No.</i>

760
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:59,620
<i>- Why are you provoking me?
- Check this out.</i>

761
00:47:00,187 --> 00:47:01,415
<i>It's perfect.</i>

762
00:47:01,587 --> 00:47:03,259
<i>You shopping for thongs
or something?</i>

763
00:47:03,427 --> 00:47:06,464
<i>Thongs? What? No... Oh, no.
No, no, no.</i>

764
00:47:06,627 --> 00:47:09,346
<i>Hot bod competition.
For buff boy here.</i>

765
00:47:09,507 --> 00:47:11,657
<i>- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.</i>

766
00:47:11,827 --> 00:47:13,943
<i>You know that I don't like
competitive stuff.</i>

767
00:47:14,107 --> 00:47:16,496
<i>He forgot to read the fine print,
$10 entry fee.</i>

768
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,623
<i>We don't have cash,
last time I checked.</i>

769
00:47:18,787 --> 00:47:21,255
<i>Crap, we need $10?</i>

770
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:25,660
<i>Are you Wyatt Fabio Goldstein?</i>

771
00:47:26,707 --> 00:47:29,301
<i>- Yeah.
- I've been looking for you for 15 years.</i>

772
00:47:29,467 --> 00:47:30,866
<i>Here you go.</i>

773
00:47:31,027 --> 00:47:33,587
<i>I finally can retire now.
That was my last delivery.</i>

774
00:47:33,747 --> 00:47:35,385
<i>I'm free.</i>

775
00:47:35,547 --> 00:47:39,381
<i>Vacations, singles cruises,
Club Med, Hawaii.</i>

776
00:47:39,547 --> 00:47:41,822
<i>I've got my whole life ahead of me.</i>

777
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:45,024
<i>Life begins today.</i>

778
00:47:50,227 --> 00:47:51,501
What is it?

779
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:52,702
I don't know.

780
00:47:52,867 --> 00:47:56,496
<i>It looks like it's a card or something
from my nana.</i>

781
00:47:57,187 --> 00:48:00,224
<i>"Happy Birthday, Wy-Wy,
you're a perfect 10.</i>

782
00:48:00,387 --> 00:48:02,503
<i>Don't spend it all in one place. "</i>

783
00:48:04,267 --> 00:48:06,019
Good old Nana.

784
00:48:06,907 --> 00:48:08,818
<i>I love her.</i>

785
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:10,784
<i>Candy's on me, boys. No king-size.</i>

786
00:48:10,947 --> 00:48:15,498
<i>Wait. Did you actually count that?
Yeah, that's 10. Here you go.</i>

787
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:18,659
<i>Bingo. You're in. All right.</i>

788
00:48:18,827 --> 00:48:20,624
<i>We'll get more.
We'll get more.</i>

789
00:48:20,787 --> 00:48:23,426
<i>- I hate you both.
- You better win.</i>

790
00:48:34,747 --> 00:48:36,146
<i>He's kind of hot.</i>

791
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:38,060
<i>Yeah.</i>

792
00:48:38,867 --> 00:48:40,425
<i>But he's got that beer gut.</i>

793
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:44,659
<i>No, no, no. No competition.</i>

794
00:48:45,387 --> 00:48:48,663
<i>Yeah, have a couple more beers,
there, cowboy.</i>

795
00:48:48,827 --> 00:48:50,419
<i>Good idea.</i>

796
00:48:51,507 --> 00:48:53,259
You suck.

797
00:48:54,267 --> 00:48:56,417
<i>I smell booty.</i>

798
00:49:00,707 --> 00:49:03,426
<i>Keep your fucking eye on the ball,
Benny.</i>

799
00:49:06,307 --> 00:49:07,456
Run.

800
00:49:07,627 --> 00:49:09,982
<i>Run like you got an ex- con
on your ass.</i>

801
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:13,025
<i>Take control. You're a defender,
for Christ's sake.</i>

802
00:49:13,187 --> 00:49:14,540
<i>Kick him in the damn shin.</i>

803
00:49:14,707 --> 00:49:17,267
<i>Hey, defence, you suck. Losers.</i>

804
00:49:17,947 --> 00:49:20,507
<i>Hey, Mom,
can I have some Gatorade?</i>

805
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:23,022
<i>No. You stop fucking up
on the field out there...</i>

806
00:49:23,187 --> 00:49:26,816
<i>...and you can have some Gatorade.
Get out there and kill those bastards.</i>

807
00:49:26,987 --> 00:49:28,420
<i>Come on, hustle.</i>

808
00:49:29,627 --> 00:49:31,618
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

809
00:49:35,547 --> 00:49:38,778
<i>- What are you doing, man? Get ready.
- Come on. It's time to grease up.</i>

810
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:41,580
<i>Come on, man, snap out of it.</i>

811
00:49:44,387 --> 00:49:45,706
<i>No, Mommy, no more games.</i>

812
00:49:45,987 --> 00:49:47,784
<i>I don't wanna play anymore.</i>

813
00:49:50,307 --> 00:49:52,457
<i>- Hey!
- Ben?</i>

814
00:49:52,627 --> 00:49:54,106
<i>What we gonna do for money?</i>

815
00:49:54,267 --> 00:49:57,145
<i>No. No. I'm not gonna...
Get out of the way! Get out!</i>

816
00:49:57,307 --> 00:49:59,343
<i>No, you should know better.
Watch out.</i>

817
00:49:59,787 --> 00:50:02,540
<i>Get out, move, watch it.</i>

818
00:50:02,707 --> 00:50:04,857
<i>He's got a tail like...</i>

819
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:07,817
<i>Oh, where is fire?</i>

820
00:50:07,987 --> 00:50:10,547
<i>Where is forest fire?</i>

821
00:50:10,987 --> 00:50:12,022
<i>- I'm so sorry.
- Hey.</i>

822
00:50:12,187 --> 00:50:13,700
<i>Let me help you up.</i>

823
00:50:18,187 --> 00:50:22,544
<i>I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to...
I didn't... Are you okay?</i>

824
00:50:22,707 --> 00:50:25,267
<i>I am fine. But I am built like ox.</i>

825
00:50:25,427 --> 00:50:27,736
<i>You are frail like mosquito.</i>

826
00:50:28,347 --> 00:50:30,383
<i>What is your name?</i>

827
00:50:31,947 --> 00:50:33,619
<i>- I'm Ben.
- Ben.</i>

828
00:50:33,787 --> 00:50:36,176
<i>My name is Walrus Boy.
Nice to meet you.</i>

829
00:50:36,347 --> 00:50:39,225
<i>Why you run around here
like scared banshee from hellfire?</i>

830
00:50:40,467 --> 00:50:42,981
<i>I was gonna do
the hot bod competition.</i>

831
00:50:43,147 --> 00:50:45,786
<i>Brilliant! I am on my way there now.</i>

832
00:50:45,947 --> 00:50:47,983
<i>The Countess Carlotta
will be there...</i>

833
00:50:48,147 --> 00:50:50,707
<i>...and I plan on stealing a kiss
from her tonight.</i>

834
00:50:50,867 --> 00:50:53,142
<i>- Come on. Let us go.
- No. You don't understand.</i>

835
00:50:53,307 --> 00:50:55,582
<i>- I don't wanna be in the competition.
- Why not?</i>

836
00:50:55,747 --> 00:50:59,137
<i>- You have hot bod.
- Well, I appreciate that.</i>

837
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:01,377
<i>- Yeah.
- But no. I can't.</i>

838
00:51:01,547 --> 00:51:03,617
<i>- I don't compete. My mother...
- Say no more.</i>

839
00:51:03,787 --> 00:51:05,857
<i>Walrus Boy know that tune.</i>

840
00:51:06,467 --> 00:51:08,776
<i>- Come sit on my bails.
- Okay.</i>

841
00:51:09,347 --> 00:51:11,986
<i>I have story to tell you, Ben.</i>

842
00:51:12,147 --> 00:51:14,138
<i>The story of a boy.</i>

843
00:51:14,307 --> 00:51:17,822
<i>Born with flipper. He did not have
wiggly fingers like other boys.</i>

844
00:51:19,227 --> 00:51:20,899
<i>He made fun of.</i>

845
00:51:21,067 --> 00:51:25,060
<i>He pelted with rocks.
He was even urinated on, Ben.</i>

846
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:27,345
<i>Pissed on.</i>

847
00:51:28,027 --> 00:51:29,585
But now...

848
00:51:29,747 --> 00:51:32,739
That boy is famous
Walrus Boy actor.

849
00:51:35,627 --> 00:51:36,946
<i>And that actor would be you?</i>

850
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:39,706
<i>Of course it is me, Ben.</i>

851
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:42,904
<i>It's me, Walrus Boy.
I famous actor.</i>

852
00:51:43,067 --> 00:51:44,295
<i>Let me tell you something.</i>

853
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:46,935
<i>The reason I am successful.</i>

854
00:51:47,107 --> 00:51:51,259
<i>I take negative past
and turn into positive future.</i>

855
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,944
<i>The point is, Ben...</i>

856
00:51:54,107 --> 00:51:59,943
<i>...never let the evil of the past
poison the fruit of your present.</i>

857
00:52:07,467 --> 00:52:09,458
<i>Stupid. What a waste of 10 bucks.</i>

858
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,380
<i>Hey, man,
I said we could have had candy.</i>

859
00:52:14,627 --> 00:52:16,982
<i>Hand me that butter.</i>

860
00:52:17,987 --> 00:52:21,821
<i>Wait a second. Does this mean
that I'm not gonna...?</i>

861
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:24,700
<i>Whatever.</i>

862
00:52:25,427 --> 00:52:26,940
<i>Let's do this.</i>

863
00:52:33,427 --> 00:52:34,576
<i>What's with the fat guy?</i>

864
00:53:51,267 --> 00:53:52,256
<i>Yeah!</i>

865
00:54:22,627 --> 00:54:24,265
<i>Yes! We won!</i>

866
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,464
<i>- I won!
- We won! Yes! We won!</i>

867
00:54:28,507 --> 00:54:32,625
<i>- Yeah. Yes. We won!
- We won.</i>

868
00:54:32,787 --> 00:54:36,826
<i>Look, I'm smoking, guys.
I don't know what to say.</i>

869
00:54:36,987 --> 00:54:38,466
<i>Thanks, everybody.</i>

870
00:54:38,627 --> 00:54:42,905
<i>Thank you, Flaglestown
and good night.</i>

871
00:54:43,067 --> 00:54:45,581
<i>Man, you were awesome.</i>

872
00:54:45,747 --> 00:54:47,578
<i>That hippity-hopping around
on the stage.</i>

873
00:54:47,747 --> 00:54:49,783
<i>- I didn't know you had it in you.
- Me neither.</i>

874
00:54:49,947 --> 00:54:52,620
<i>I owe it to Walrus Boy for showing me
to stand up for myself.</i>

875
00:54:52,787 --> 00:54:53,981
Walrus Boy?

876
00:54:54,147 --> 00:54:55,546
You know him?

877
00:54:55,707 --> 00:54:57,504
<i>I just talked to him about
an hour ago.</i>

878
00:54:57,667 --> 00:54:59,498
<i>I didn't get a chance to thank him.</i>

879
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:02,386
<i>He died in '46.</i>

880
00:55:06,067 --> 00:55:09,343
<i>I'm just messing with you.
We play Hold 'Em on Wednesdays.</i>

881
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:12,021
<i>I'll tell him you said thanks.</i>

882
00:55:12,787 --> 00:55:15,824
<i>So we got the best suite
Flaglestown has to offer.</i>

883
00:55:15,987 --> 00:55:19,582
<i>Excuse me. Hey, I wanted to tell you,
you were amazing out there.</i>

884
00:55:19,747 --> 00:55:21,703
<i>Your body is ripped- tastic.</i>

885
00:55:23,107 --> 00:55:25,223
<i>Hey, thanks, man.</i>

886
00:55:25,387 --> 00:55:27,264
<i>Will you sign my pecs?</i>

887
00:55:27,707 --> 00:55:29,584
<i>Absolutely.</i>

888
00:55:30,107 --> 00:55:32,337
<i>- It's Barri but with an I.
- Oh, all right.</i>

889
00:55:32,507 --> 00:55:36,500
<i>All right. Here. B...
That's an awesome name, man.</i>

890
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:40,057
<i>- I'll just use your nipple to dot the I.
- Nice.</i>

891
00:55:40,867 --> 00:55:42,664
Stay firm.

892
00:55:42,827 --> 00:55:45,022
<i>Know what I'm talking about? Ben.</i>

893
00:55:45,187 --> 00:55:48,065
<i>- That's a nice six-pack there, buddy.
- Oh, thanks, man.</i>

894
00:55:48,227 --> 00:55:50,536
<i>- But I'd kill for these.
- Oh, dude. Come on, man.</i>

895
00:55:50,707 --> 00:55:52,538
<i>- Nice to meet you.
- You keep it firm.</i>

896
00:55:52,707 --> 00:55:55,062
<i>Yeah, man, abs not flabs,
you know what I mean?</i>

897
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,024
<i>Stay off the sugar.
Sugar's the enemy.</i>

898
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,257
<i>Yeah, man. No carbs.</i>

899
00:55:59,947 --> 00:56:03,223
<i>Man. You are like a celebrity
around here.</i>

900
00:56:03,387 --> 00:56:06,584
<i>That's so awesome.
You are like a gay celebrity.</i>

901
00:56:06,747 --> 00:56:08,419
<i>- What?
- Yeah, that was pretty gay.</i>

902
00:56:08,587 --> 00:56:10,976
<i>You guys touching abs
and stuff like that. That was...</i>

903
00:56:11,147 --> 00:56:13,741
<i>I wonder if he's the prize
at the gay booth?</i>

904
00:56:13,907 --> 00:56:16,944
<i>- Could you sign me?
- Yeah, could you sign my abs?</i>

905
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:19,541
<i>Do something with my belly button.
Do something fun.</i>

906
00:56:19,707 --> 00:56:21,663
<i>- You got nice abs.
- No, you have the hotness.</i>

907
00:56:21,827 --> 00:56:23,465
<i>Are you guys... Are you children?</i>

908
00:56:23,627 --> 00:56:26,016
<i>You couple of ass clowns,
you're both pathetic.</i>

909
00:56:26,187 --> 00:56:28,701
<i>You're pathetic slobs.</i>

910
00:56:31,307 --> 00:56:33,138
<i>Mama told me she liked my belly.</i>

911
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:35,377
<i>It's prosthetic.</i>

912
00:56:35,547 --> 00:56:37,060
<i>- That means rubber.
- Yeah.</i>

913
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,060
<i>And I get phantom pains, it itches.</i>

914
00:56:40,227 --> 00:56:42,138
<i>You know,
sometimes I think it was God...</i>

915
00:56:42,307 --> 00:56:46,061
<i>...made me drink that Jägermeister,
stick my arm in that concrete mixer.</i>

916
00:56:46,227 --> 00:56:49,856
<i>So stupid. I don't know what I did,
it must've been real bad.</i>

917
00:56:50,027 --> 00:56:52,416
<i>- I don't know, it's...
- Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.</i>

918
00:56:52,587 --> 00:56:55,340
<i>Son, listen to me for just a second.</i>

919
00:56:55,507 --> 00:56:57,657
<i>People get sick of hearing
about your stories.</i>

920
00:56:57,987 --> 00:57:00,262
<i>Don't wanna hear them
stupid stories no more.</i>

921
00:57:00,427 --> 00:57:02,463
<i>Yeah, I got your arm.
Yeah, I got your arm.</i>

922
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,777
<i>I'm gonna keep your arm too.
I'm gonna keep it.</i>

923
00:57:13,587 --> 00:57:15,942
<i>What smells like corn on the cob?</i>

924
00:57:22,827 --> 00:57:24,977
<i>You still wearing that butter?</i>

925
00:57:25,547 --> 00:57:28,061
<i>Yeah. I like the way it feels on me.</i>

926
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,539
<i>What's happening to you?</i>

927
00:57:32,707 --> 00:57:35,858
<i>Guys, remember when I said I had
a surprise for you in New Mexico?</i>

928
00:57:36,587 --> 00:57:37,986
- No.
- No.

929
00:57:38,147 --> 00:57:39,500
<i>Oh, I forgot.</i>

930
00:57:39,667 --> 00:57:42,386
<i>I have a surprise for you
in New Mexico.</i>

931
00:57:42,547 --> 00:57:44,902
<i>I'll give you a hint: Sixth grade.</i>

932
00:57:45,507 --> 00:57:47,145
Miss Isaac?

933
00:57:47,307 --> 00:57:49,662
<i>- Hottest teacher ever.
- You're kidding, right?</i>

934
00:57:49,827 --> 00:57:51,419
<i>No, remember
when she used to say...</i>

935
00:57:51,587 --> 00:57:53,782
<i>...she would quit it all
and move to New Mexico?</i>

936
00:57:53,947 --> 00:57:56,336
<i>- Yeah.
- Well, colour me Google...</i>

937
00:57:56,507 --> 00:58:00,500
<i>...because I found her on the Internet.
And I told her we'll be driving through.</i>

938
00:58:02,027 --> 00:58:03,380
Miss Isaac.

939
00:58:13,467 --> 00:58:17,506
<i>Parallelogram.</i>

940
00:58:23,827 --> 00:58:26,421
<i>Miss Boobies.</i>

941
00:58:36,867 --> 00:58:39,825
<i>I've dreamt about this day for years.</i>

942
00:58:40,707 --> 00:58:43,062
<i>What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?</i>

943
00:58:52,347 --> 00:58:54,065
Look who it is.

944
00:58:55,467 --> 00:58:59,096
<i>I never thought I'd see
you little birds again.</i>

945
00:59:00,107 --> 00:59:01,381
<i>Bet you missed these.</i>

946
00:59:04,547 --> 00:59:07,107
<i>- Miss Isaac?
- Who else do you think it is, dumbass?</i>

947
00:59:07,267 --> 00:59:09,417
<i>Give me a squeeze.</i>

948
00:59:10,867 --> 00:59:15,941
<i>Well, Wyatt, I see you still got
that twisted hot dog obsession, huh?</i>

949
00:59:16,147 --> 00:59:17,580
<i>Nice.</i>

950
00:59:19,307 --> 00:59:22,140
<i>Don't stand there like a bunch
of boners, lunch is on in five.</i>

951
00:59:22,307 --> 00:59:23,660
<i>Come on.</i>

952
00:59:27,427 --> 00:59:29,702
<i>Thank you for ruining
my sixth grade fantasy.</i>

953
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:33,576
<i>- She's so disgusting.
- Guys, she's still a person.</i>

954
00:59:33,787 --> 00:59:35,106
<i>Is she?</i>

955
00:59:37,427 --> 00:59:40,703
<i>It's hot as crotch out here.
I'm sweating my balls off.</i>

956
00:59:40,867 --> 00:59:43,062
<i>You know what you boys need?</i>

957
00:59:43,227 --> 00:59:46,139
<i>A Mexican blowjob.</i>

958
00:59:46,347 --> 00:59:48,736
<i>- A what?
- Mexican blowjob.</i>

959
00:59:48,907 --> 00:59:51,705
<i>Tequila, whipped cream.</i>

960
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:54,423
<i>Tequila?</i>

961
00:59:54,587 --> 00:59:55,622
It's 11:30.

962
00:59:55,787 --> 00:59:58,779
<i>- You know, for me that's early...
- Yeah, I mean, it's...</i>

963
00:59:58,947 --> 01:00:01,017
<i>That's too early for...</i>

964
01:00:01,187 --> 01:00:03,860
<i>- Down the hatch.
- Okay. One shot.</i>

965
01:00:04,027 --> 01:00:05,346
<i>Yeah.</i>

966
01:00:06,107 --> 01:00:08,496
<i>That really gets you going.</i>

967
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:11,420
<i>- Come on, bitches.
- Miss Isaac, I really shouldn't.</i>

968
01:00:11,587 --> 01:00:13,020
I'm driving.

969
01:00:13,187 --> 01:00:15,906
<i>We all need to be alert
because we're all navigators.</i>

970
01:00:16,067 --> 01:00:17,705
<i>We need to keep our eyes
on the road.</i>

971
01:00:17,867 --> 01:00:19,619
<i>Wise words.
But do I want to get drunk?</i>

972
01:00:19,787 --> 01:00:22,984
<i>I wanna get drunk,
but we gotta go, so...</i>

973
01:00:23,147 --> 01:00:25,980
<i>Fine, you pansies. Fine.</i>

974
01:00:30,267 --> 01:00:32,701
<i>- You don't need...
- Careful with your teeth.</i>

975
01:00:43,667 --> 01:00:45,419
How many was that?

976
01:00:45,587 --> 01:00:47,259
<i>I think that was five.</i>

977
01:00:47,427 --> 01:00:49,702
<i>Five.</i>

978
01:00:50,627 --> 01:00:52,379
<i>Time for lunch, eses.</i>

979
01:00:54,427 --> 01:00:58,466
<i>Hope you like egg salad,
it's my speciality.</i>

980
01:00:59,027 --> 01:01:00,665
All right.

981
01:01:01,347 --> 01:01:04,942
<i>That's a really healthy way
to prepare that.</i>

982
01:01:07,107 --> 01:01:08,665
<i>So you live by yourself out here?</i>

983
01:01:08,827 --> 01:01:12,103
<i>Ever since that rat bastard left me
for the gas station slut.</i>

984
01:01:12,267 --> 01:01:15,065
<i>Hope she likes wearing the ball gag.</i>

985
01:01:15,227 --> 01:01:16,979
I don't miss that.

986
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:21,657
<i>Well, you know what they say...</i>

987
01:01:21,827 --> 01:01:23,704
<i>...that every cloud...</i>

988
01:01:24,827 --> 01:01:27,546
<i>That every cloud has...</i>

989
01:01:28,587 --> 01:01:29,861
<i>Something.</i>

990
01:01:30,027 --> 01:01:32,700
<i>So now it's just me and my Benny...</i>

991
01:01:33,507 --> 01:01:36,260
<i>...named after my favourite student.</i>

992
01:01:38,107 --> 01:01:40,257
<i>Come to Mama, Benny.</i>

993
01:01:43,427 --> 01:01:44,906
<i>How's life treating you boys?</i>

994
01:01:47,507 --> 01:01:49,816
<i>Just fine, I guess.</i>

995
01:01:50,347 --> 01:01:52,986
<i>Well, it was nice
to visit your old teach.</i>

996
01:01:53,147 --> 01:01:54,739
<i>You haven't changed a bit.</i>

997
01:01:56,667 --> 01:01:58,305
<i>You, either?</i>

998
01:02:05,387 --> 01:02:07,139
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

999
01:02:15,067 --> 01:02:17,945
<i>How do you
like living out here by yourself?</i>

1000
01:02:18,107 --> 01:02:21,338
<i>- Are you happy out here?
- What is not to love, you know?</i>

1001
01:02:21,507 --> 01:02:23,862
<i>I am living
like a New Mexican queen.</i>

1002
01:02:25,147 --> 01:02:27,024
<i>Enough, all right? Enough.</i>

1003
01:02:28,347 --> 01:02:32,181
<i>Any who, guess what I made
you boys for dessert?</i>

1004
01:02:32,387 --> 01:02:34,537
Tapioca pudding.

1005
01:02:35,467 --> 01:02:38,777
<i>And I made it
with my own two hands.</i>

1006
01:02:40,867 --> 01:02:43,779
<i>I think I ate that sandwich
too fast. It was tasty.</i>

1007
01:02:43,947 --> 01:02:45,778
<i>- We gotta go. I just realised.
- Yeah.</i>

1008
01:02:45,947 --> 01:02:48,415
<i>- We're on the clock.
- I thought this was a booty call...</i>

1009
01:02:50,827 --> 01:02:52,385
Miss Isaac?

1010
01:02:52,867 --> 01:02:54,937
<i>- What the hell just happened?
- Is she dead?</i>

1011
01:02:55,107 --> 01:02:56,096
I don't know.

1012
01:02:56,267 --> 01:02:59,418
<i>- And I don't wanna find out.
- I've never checked a pulse.</i>

1013
01:03:01,187 --> 01:03:03,257
<i>- Get it, touch her wrist.
- I don't wanna...</i>

1014
01:03:06,907 --> 01:03:09,626
<i>- She's back.
- That narcolepsy's a bitch.</i>

1015
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:13,302
<i>Sometimes I'm out for a few seconds,
sometimes a few hours.</i>

1016
01:03:13,467 --> 01:03:15,219
<i>I better say goodbye
to you boys now.</i>

1017
01:03:15,387 --> 01:03:16,456
<i>Once they start...</i>

1018
01:03:18,147 --> 01:03:20,183
<i>Dude, what the hell
is wrong with this lady?</i>

1019
01:03:20,347 --> 01:03:22,178
<i>We are leaving right now.
Right.</i>

1020
01:03:22,347 --> 01:03:26,181
<i>Well, I mean, should we, well,
I guess she said goodbye.</i>

1021
01:03:26,347 --> 01:03:28,861
<i>Yeah, she said goodbye.
We're saying goodbye right now.</i>

1022
01:03:29,027 --> 01:03:30,938
<i>Thank you for lunch, Miss Isaac,
bye- bye.</i>

1023
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:32,506
<i>Thanks, Miss Isaac.
Bye- bye.</i>

1024
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:34,578
<i>You can't just leave her here
like this.</i>

1025
01:03:34,747 --> 01:03:37,466
<i>- Just get in and shut up!
- Ben.</i>

1026
01:03:38,587 --> 01:03:41,260
<i>Let me just... I'll just put something
underneath so she...</i>

1027
01:03:41,427 --> 01:03:44,066
<i>At least she doesn't hurt her head
or anything.</i>

1028
01:03:44,227 --> 01:03:46,058
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1029
01:03:47,067 --> 01:03:48,944
<i>Oh, God, no.</i>

1030
01:03:51,107 --> 01:03:52,096
Wyatt.

1031
01:03:53,627 --> 01:03:56,016
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

1032
01:03:56,187 --> 01:03:57,302
Hurry!

1033
01:03:58,147 --> 01:03:58,420
<i>I still can't believe
that's the same person.</i>

1034
01:03:58,427 --> 01:04:00,224
<i>I still can't believe
that's the same person.</i>

1035
01:04:00,387 --> 01:04:02,582
<i>Yeah, she was pretty narsty.</i>

1036
01:04:02,747 --> 01:04:04,783
<i>I don't think I can jerk off
to her anymore.</i>

1037
01:04:04,947 --> 01:04:06,778
You don't think?

1038
01:04:06,947 --> 01:04:08,539
<i>- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, man.</i>

1039
01:04:08,707 --> 01:04:11,699
<i>- Antacid?
- What, you nervous or something?</i>

1040
01:04:12,467 --> 01:04:14,901
<i>No, it's just that... Come on.</i>

1041
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:18,776
<i>I thought since we was a couple
days away you was getting nervous.</i>

1042
01:04:19,227 --> 01:04:20,455
What? No.

1043
01:04:20,627 --> 01:04:23,187
<i>No, no, that's funny, though,
that's funny.</i>

1044
01:04:23,347 --> 01:04:25,224
<i>No, it's...</i>

1045
01:04:25,387 --> 01:04:27,503
<i>It's a couple days away.</i>

1046
01:04:28,387 --> 01:04:30,139
<i>Well, that's good.</i>

1047
01:04:32,067 --> 01:04:35,025
<i>- Let's go, boys.
- Let's go.</i>

1048
01:05:00,427 --> 01:05:03,100
<i>Help me, Wyatt.</i>

1049
01:05:28,427 --> 01:05:30,702
<i>Don't put on too much gel, damn it.</i>

1050
01:05:33,187 --> 01:05:35,576
<i>You need to lose
some of that extra weight.</i>

1051
01:05:35,747 --> 01:05:39,342
<i>I don't like looking at your rolls
when I'm getting my makeup done.</i>

1052
01:05:39,507 --> 01:05:44,183
<i>No one should have to watch
that shit jiggle.</i>

1053
01:05:46,427 --> 01:05:48,782
<i>Who the hell is that in my studio?</i>

1054
01:06:03,147 --> 01:06:05,945
<i>I think it's time to shut you up.</i>

1055
01:06:06,787 --> 01:06:08,618
<i>Permanently.</i>

1056
01:06:19,587 --> 01:06:20,702
<i>Dwayne.</i>

1057
01:06:27,267 --> 01:06:30,942
<i>Joel, you're shaking
in your boots, son.</i>

1058
01:06:31,107 --> 01:06:34,816
<i>And I bet right about now,
your palms are sweatier...</i>

1059
01:06:34,987 --> 01:06:39,503
<i>...than a fat man's ass crack
on a hot Georgia day.</i>

1060
01:06:41,067 --> 01:06:45,219
<i>Oh, Joel, even in your dreams...</i>

1061
01:06:45,387 --> 01:06:50,177
<i>...you're a pathetic coward!</i>

1062
01:06:50,347 --> 01:06:53,737
<i>It's like he's content
being a shoe boy.</i>

1063
01:06:53,907 --> 01:06:56,865
<i>I can tell you miss the smell
in your dumb ass face.</i>

1064
01:07:04,147 --> 01:07:06,377
<i>You can't beat me, Joel.</i>

1065
01:07:06,547 --> 01:07:08,777
<i>I'm a PhD doctor, son.</i>

1066
01:07:46,787 --> 01:07:48,618
<i>Where's Joel?</i>

1067
01:07:50,387 --> 01:07:51,502
<i>Hey.</i>

1068
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:53,225
What?

1069
01:07:53,627 --> 01:07:55,538
<i>Where's Joel?</i>

1070
01:07:57,547 --> 01:07:59,265
<i>What the...?</i>

1071
01:08:00,427 --> 01:08:02,463
<i>There's a note on my chest.</i>

1072
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,385
Look at this.

1073
01:08:10,067 --> 01:08:14,424
<i>"Guys, I'm really sorry to do this... "</i>

1074
01:08:14,587 --> 01:08:16,225
<i>But I have to go home.</i>

1075
01:08:16,387 --> 01:08:19,823
<i>I just can't tak e the chance
of getting humiliated again.</i>

1076
01:08:19,987 --> 01:08:22,103
<i>This whole thing was a mistak e.</i>

1077
01:08:22,267 --> 01:08:26,055
<i>I've tak en 300 bucks
and I'm gonna buy a bus tick et.</i>

1078
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:27,296
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1079
01:08:27,467 --> 01:08:28,980
<i>"Joel. "</i>

1080
01:08:31,987 --> 01:08:33,579
<i>Wyatt, we have to find him.</i>

1081
01:08:34,627 --> 01:08:36,026
<i>All right, Wyatt, let's go.</i>

1082
01:08:36,187 --> 01:08:38,576
<i>- Here you go.
- Why don't you pick up your bag...?</i>

1083
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:40,260
I'm sorry.

1084
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:42,698
<i>Where do you think you're going?</i>

1085
01:08:46,227 --> 01:08:48,297
<i>Oh, I'm fine.</i>

1086
01:08:48,467 --> 01:08:51,106
<i>Are you all right?</i>

1087
01:08:54,067 --> 01:08:56,820
<i>Bathroom's where I say it is.</i>

1088
01:09:14,387 --> 01:09:15,615
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

1089
01:09:16,107 --> 01:09:18,541
<i>- Me?
- Joel, it's me, Timmy.</i>

1090
01:09:18,707 --> 01:09:21,175
<i>Timmy O'Shaemus
from down the block.</i>

1091
01:09:21,347 --> 01:09:22,336
<i>You remember.</i>

1092
01:09:22,507 --> 01:09:25,021
<i>Timmy, he has too many demons.</i>

1093
01:09:25,187 --> 01:09:27,985
<i>Joel, don't give up. Fight him.</i>

1094
01:09:28,147 --> 01:09:30,377
<i>You've gotta fight him.</i>

1095
01:09:47,107 --> 01:09:48,506
<i>Grape fizz burp.</i>

1096
01:09:48,667 --> 01:09:51,977
<i>I'm sure you miss the smell
of those in your dumb ass face.</i>

1097
01:09:53,667 --> 01:09:56,420
<i>- Drake?
- Who else would it be, stupid bitch?</i>

1098
01:09:59,027 --> 01:10:00,460
No.

1099
01:10:00,627 --> 01:10:03,425
<i>No. Leave me alone,
leave me alone.</i>

1100
01:10:03,587 --> 01:10:05,657
<i>- Leave me alone.
- Where are you going, loser?</i>

1101
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:08,216
<i>Where you going, loser?</i>

1102
01:10:16,947 --> 01:10:17,936
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1103
01:10:18,667 --> 01:10:20,066
<i>Where are you going?</i>

1104
01:10:20,227 --> 01:10:22,422
<i>Relax and enjoy the show,
vagina face.</i>

1105
01:10:26,467 --> 01:10:28,901
<i>Hey, toolbox, why you digging
in the garbage?</i>

1106
01:10:29,067 --> 01:10:30,659
<i>You looking for your filthy mother?</i>

1107
01:10:30,827 --> 01:10:33,580
<i>No. I'm reducing,
reusing and recycling.</i>

1108
01:10:33,747 --> 01:10:35,783
<i>Mrs. Yazel lets me leave
Math-a-letes early.</i>

1109
01:10:35,947 --> 01:10:37,175
<i>I'm in the Recycling Club.</i>

1110
01:10:37,347 --> 01:10:40,020
<i>You're in the Gaylord Club,
you little douche bag.</i>

1111
01:10:40,187 --> 01:10:42,143
<i>You're about to join
the Smashed Face Club.</i>

1112
01:10:42,307 --> 01:10:45,379
<i>No, Drake. See, I don't
wanna join the Smashed Face Club.</i>

1113
01:10:46,107 --> 01:10:47,096
<i>It's entertaining.</i>

1114
01:10:49,467 --> 01:10:51,105
<i>Oh, saved by the bell, huh?</i>

1115
01:10:51,987 --> 01:10:55,297
<i>- Oh, God.
- Or should I say burned by it.</i>

1116
01:10:59,627 --> 01:11:02,585
<i>All right, nothing to see here.</i>

1117
01:11:02,787 --> 01:11:04,220
<i>Oh, this is my favourite part.</i>

1118
01:11:04,387 --> 01:11:06,457
<i>- You remember.
- Pull your pants up.</i>

1119
01:11:09,027 --> 01:11:11,541
<i>Oh, what, like none of you guys
have ever farted before?</i>

1120
01:11:11,707 --> 01:11:13,857
<i>Oh, my God, look.</i>

1121
01:11:14,067 --> 01:11:17,343
<i>Gross, it wasn't just a fart.</i>

1122
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:23,025
<i>Poo pants, poo pants,
poo pants, poo pants.</i>

1123
01:11:23,587 --> 01:11:25,782
<i>Oh, I hated that name.</i>

1124
01:11:26,147 --> 01:11:27,819
<i>It's a good name.</i>

1125
01:11:47,107 --> 01:11:48,984
<i>Never again.</i>

1126
01:11:49,747 --> 01:11:53,137
<i>Never again!</i>

1127
01:11:57,707 --> 01:12:00,380
<i>Pucker up, pussycats.</i>

1128
01:12:02,107 --> 01:12:03,699
<i>Now who's the meat?</i>

1129
01:12:04,547 --> 01:12:07,903
<i>Hold it right there, you damn,
dirty hippies.</i>

1130
01:12:08,067 --> 01:12:10,137
<i>There'll be no branding today.</i>

1131
01:12:13,907 --> 01:12:15,579
<i>He had to go.</i>

1132
01:12:28,627 --> 01:12:29,980
<i>Welcome back.</i>

1133
01:12:36,187 --> 01:12:39,099
<i>Sorry I took so long, boys.</i>

1134
01:13:17,947 --> 01:13:20,063
<i>- Yeah!
- Yes!</i>

1135
01:13:20,947 --> 01:13:22,505
That's right.

1136
01:13:22,667 --> 01:13:24,817
<i>- Good work, guys.
- Yes, sir.</i>

1137
01:13:24,987 --> 01:13:27,296
- What got into you?
- Right?

1138
01:13:27,467 --> 01:13:29,583
<i>That was awesome, man.</i>

1139
01:13:29,867 --> 01:13:31,300
<i>Let's go.</i>

1140
01:13:31,467 --> 01:13:35,301
<i>If we ride through the night,
we can reach L.A. By daybreak.</i>

1141
01:13:36,187 --> 01:13:38,781
<i>It was a good thing we had all
that climbing rope handy.</i>

1142
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:41,415
<i>Yeah, I heard that.</i>

1143
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:07,538
<i>Guys. Guys, look.</i>

1144
01:14:08,067 --> 01:14:10,786
<i>Hollywood, Hollywood.</i>

1145
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:13,507
<i>Ninety-one exit. Next exit.</i>

1146
01:14:13,667 --> 01:14:15,623
<i>- Oh, my goodness.
- We made it. Hey, Joel...</i>

1147
01:14:15,787 --> 01:14:17,379
<i>...I wanna see you kick serious ass.</i>

1148
01:14:17,547 --> 01:14:18,866
<i>- The smack is on.
- Absolutely.</i>

1149
01:14:19,027 --> 01:14:21,621
<i>- Down.
- The smack is down, uptown.</i>

1150
01:14:21,787 --> 01:14:23,698
<i>I was wondering, is it illegal?</i>

1151
01:14:23,867 --> 01:14:26,301
<i>Is that a crime?
You know what I'm saying?</i>

1152
01:14:26,467 --> 01:14:29,186
<i>- Could I go to jail for kicking his ass?
- Absolutely not.</i>

1153
01:14:29,347 --> 01:14:32,384
<i>I think revenge is actually legal
in America, so...</i>

1154
01:14:45,987 --> 01:14:48,660
<i>Good morning, ma'am.
See your driver's licence?</i>

1155
01:14:49,347 --> 01:14:50,575
<i>Where we going, gentlemen?</i>

1156
01:14:50,747 --> 01:14:52,624
<i>It's all right.
I'm here to see Dr. Dwayne.</i>

1157
01:14:52,787 --> 01:14:54,743
<i>- I know him.
- You and the rest of America.</i>

1158
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:56,499
<i>You got any tickets?</i>

1159
01:14:56,667 --> 01:14:58,737
<i>Not technically,
no, we don't have tickets.</i>

1160
01:14:58,907 --> 01:15:00,863
<i>Tough break, kid,
I wish I could help you.</i>

1161
01:15:01,027 --> 01:15:02,426
<i>- Now get lost.
- What?</i>

1162
01:15:02,587 --> 01:15:03,736
<i>- State your name.
- What?</i>

1163
01:15:03,907 --> 01:15:06,296
<i>State your name.
State your name and purpose.</i>

1164
01:15:06,507 --> 01:15:08,020
<i>What are you...?</i>

1165
01:15:10,307 --> 01:15:12,025
<i>Oh, my God! She...!</i>

1166
01:15:12,187 --> 01:15:14,337
<i>What kind of officer are you, man?</i>

1167
01:15:14,507 --> 01:15:15,496
<i>Jesus!</i>

1168
01:15:16,147 --> 01:15:19,662
<i>My God, that woman is still twitching.</i>

1169
01:15:19,827 --> 01:15:21,818
<i>Jeez, what the hell do we do now?</i>

1170
01:15:24,267 --> 01:15:25,939
<i>Hi there.</i>

1171
01:15:26,347 --> 01:15:30,022
<i>Sorry, I wanted to actually come over
and apologise...</i>

1172
01:15:30,187 --> 01:15:31,700
<i>...for what had happened earlier.</i>

1173
01:15:31,867 --> 01:15:34,097
<i>We might have got off
on the wrong foot. I'm Ben.</i>

1174
01:15:34,267 --> 01:15:35,859
<i>- Jim.
- Nice to meet you, Jim.</i>

1175
01:15:36,027 --> 01:15:38,587
<i>Listen, we're not here to break in
to anywhere...</i>

1176
01:15:38,747 --> 01:15:42,820
<i>...we're not trying to do anything
wrong. We wanna spread happiness.</i>

1177
01:15:42,987 --> 01:15:45,945
<i>Happiness in the form
of a good wiener.</i>

1178
01:15:51,587 --> 01:15:55,500
<i>Maybe you'd like a little mustard,
a little ketchup, a little meat.</i>

1179
01:16:09,827 --> 01:16:11,704
<i>You're reaching
for your winter parka...</i>

1180
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:14,062
<i>...and it's the Fourth of July, okay?</i>

1181
01:16:14,227 --> 01:16:18,778
<i>You can't see the flame from
the firecracker, and you know what?</i>

1182
01:16:18,947 --> 01:16:21,507
<i>You are about to blow.</i>

1183
01:16:21,667 --> 01:16:23,578
<i>Do you understand me when
I use the word...?</i>

1184
01:16:23,747 --> 01:16:24,975
You.

1185
01:16:34,107 --> 01:16:35,540
<i>I'll kill you, Dwayne.</i>

1186
01:16:39,427 --> 01:16:41,065
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

1187
01:16:41,227 --> 01:16:42,706
Boys.

1188
01:16:42,867 --> 01:16:44,823
<i>- Joel.
- Dr. Dwayne?</i>

1189
01:16:44,987 --> 01:16:46,659
<i>There's two of them.</i>

1190
01:16:46,827 --> 01:16:48,419
<i>I knew it.</i>

1191
01:16:49,147 --> 01:16:53,060
<i>Joel, meet decoy. Decoy, meet Joel.</i>

1192
01:16:56,347 --> 01:16:58,497
<i>I'm getting paid, y'all.</i>

1193
01:17:00,587 --> 01:17:02,179
<i>You know, you can't be too careful.</i>

1194
01:17:02,347 --> 01:17:04,861
<i>I heard about you
after your incident at the gate...</i>

1195
01:17:05,027 --> 01:17:08,019
<i>...so I sent decoy out
to do the show, just in case.</i>

1196
01:17:08,187 --> 01:17:11,020
<i>That thing on your face
is nasty, son.</i>

1197
01:17:11,187 --> 01:17:13,018
<i>Don't look at me, son,
don't look at me.</i>

1198
01:17:13,187 --> 01:17:17,180
<i>It's okay, everyone. Okay? I'm okay.</i>

1199
01:17:21,307 --> 01:17:23,423
<i>We'll take care of this right away,
Dr. Dwayne.</i>

1200
01:17:23,587 --> 01:17:25,179
<i>Get your hands off of me.</i>

1201
01:17:25,347 --> 01:17:26,462
<i>Wait a second, Dwayne.</i>

1202
01:17:26,627 --> 01:17:28,822
<i>I came here to say something
and I'm gonna say it.</i>

1203
01:17:31,227 --> 01:17:33,138
<i>Okay, boys, keep them rolling.</i>

1204
01:17:33,307 --> 01:17:35,662
<i>So, Joel...</i>

1205
01:17:35,827 --> 01:17:37,055
...what's on your mind?

1206
01:17:37,227 --> 01:17:39,582
<i>My girlfriend dumped me.</i>

1207
01:17:39,907 --> 01:17:41,738
I lost my job.

1208
01:17:42,707 --> 01:17:47,861
<i>I lived on chips for months.
My life fell to shit because of you.</i>

1209
01:17:49,587 --> 01:17:50,576
<i>Joel.</i>

1210
01:17:50,747 --> 01:17:53,864
<i>You make my toes perspire,
they're so warm and toasty...</i>

1211
01:17:54,027 --> 01:17:57,303
<i>...from the fire inside of you.
And you know what that means?</i>

1212
01:17:57,467 --> 01:17:59,139
<i>It means you're a man now.</i>

1213
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:01,616
<i>It means that you have
faced your fears.</i>

1214
01:18:01,787 --> 01:18:06,417
<i>It means you overcame
Drake Hanswald.</i>

1215
01:18:08,947 --> 01:18:11,700
Wait. What?
How did you know that?

1216
01:18:11,867 --> 01:18:15,303
<i>I'm a PhD doctor, son, you can't eat
the onion without peeling it.</i>

1217
01:18:15,467 --> 01:18:21,064
<i>I mean, if you think about it,
getting dumped, what I did for you:</i>

1218
01:18:21,307 --> 01:18:23,616
<i>Best thing in the world.</i>

1219
01:18:25,107 --> 01:18:26,745
Right?

1220
01:18:28,547 --> 01:18:30,777
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1221
01:18:33,227 --> 01:18:34,785
<i>You're right.</i>

1222
01:18:41,707 --> 01:18:44,858
<i>I think you changed my life
for the better.</i>

1223
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:46,536
<i>Yes.</i>

1224
01:18:46,707 --> 01:18:47,981
<i>Yes.</i>

1225
01:18:48,147 --> 01:18:52,265
<i>Release that prisoner.
Release him to my arms.</i>

1226
01:18:58,867 --> 01:19:03,224
<i>Now. Wyatt Fabio Goldstein.</i>

1227
01:19:03,907 --> 01:19:05,056
<i>Yeah, what...?</i>

1228
01:19:05,227 --> 01:19:07,661
<i>What's happening, Dr. Dwayne?</i>

1229
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:09,897
<i>Rejected 12 times.</i>

1230
01:19:10,507 --> 01:19:13,579
<i>That is a whole heap of rejection.</i>

1231
01:19:13,747 --> 01:19:19,344
<i>But now, it's surprise time
right here on the Dr. Dwayne Show.</i>

1232
01:19:21,707 --> 01:19:23,902
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...</i>

1233
01:19:24,067 --> 01:19:28,185
<i>...Cornelius Worthington III.</i>

1234
01:19:32,947 --> 01:19:36,701
<i>How are you, Wyatt? Okay.</i>

1235
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:39,495
<i>Hey, you're that junkie
from behind the dumpster.</i>

1236
01:19:39,667 --> 01:19:41,817
<i>Guilty as charged.</i>

1237
01:19:42,267 --> 01:19:43,825
<i>Yeah, that was me, everyone.</i>

1238
01:19:43,987 --> 01:19:47,423
<i>Down on my luck,
hopped up on gack...</i>

1239
01:19:47,587 --> 01:19:51,500
<i>...urinating on myself
just to feel my legs.</i>

1240
01:19:52,067 --> 01:19:53,420
<i>But you saved me.</i>

1241
01:19:53,587 --> 01:19:56,784
<i>You saved me with a hot dog
and a smile.</i>

1242
01:19:56,947 --> 01:20:00,337
<i>- I thank you for it, Wyatt.
- No... No problem, junkie man.</i>

1243
01:20:00,947 --> 01:20:01,936
Mr. Worthington.

1244
01:20:02,107 --> 01:20:04,416
<i>Hey, cut it out, Wyatt.</i>

1245
01:20:04,587 --> 01:20:05,906
<i>Let's cut to the chase.</i>

1246
01:20:06,107 --> 01:20:08,416
<i>I wanna finance Wyatt's Wieners.</i>

1247
01:20:08,587 --> 01:20:10,225
<i>- Really? Are you serious?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

1248
01:20:10,387 --> 01:20:13,618
<i>- I'm dead serious.
- Cornelius Worthington III!</i>

1249
01:20:13,787 --> 01:20:16,745
<i>Mama, I got money.
Mama, I got money.</i>

1250
01:20:16,907 --> 01:20:19,819
<i>You all see that? Surprises
and dreams come true...</i>

1251
01:20:19,987 --> 01:20:22,421
<i>...right here
on the Dr. Dwayne Show.</i>

1252
01:20:22,587 --> 01:20:27,377
<i>Gosh darn it, I feel like I just
peeked up the tooth fairy's skirt...</i>

1253
01:20:27,547 --> 01:20:30,141
<i>...and poured myself
a plate of lasagna.</i>

1254
01:20:30,307 --> 01:20:33,219
<i>That's how I feel.</i>

1255
01:20:33,387 --> 01:20:35,981
<i>Tin Man, I bet you got
some fire to get off...</i>

1256
01:20:36,147 --> 01:20:38,138
<i>...that perfectly sculpted chest.</i>

1257
01:20:40,947 --> 01:20:42,460
You know what?

1258
01:20:42,747 --> 01:20:44,703
<i>You know what, Dr. Dwayne?
I think I do.</i>

1259
01:20:44,867 --> 01:20:47,700
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Ben.</i>

1260
01:20:47,867 --> 01:20:50,335
<i>- Hi, Ben.
- Listen, I've realised a lot on this trip...</i>

1261
01:20:50,507 --> 01:20:54,819
<i>...with my best friends, but the one
thing that I'm realising the most...</i>

1262
01:20:54,987 --> 01:20:57,421
<i>...is that this whole rat race...</i>

1263
01:20:57,587 --> 01:20:59,942
<i>...this circus that we call life...</i>

1264
01:21:00,107 --> 01:21:02,143
<i>...it's really all about love.
L- O-V-E.</i>

1265
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:08,824
<i>And it doesn't matter if you love
someone that's white or black.</i>

1266
01:21:09,987 --> 01:21:11,181
<i>Whether you love a girl...</i>

1267
01:21:12,787 --> 01:21:13,822
<i>...or you love a man.</i>

1268
01:21:21,467 --> 01:21:22,536
Thank you.

1269
01:21:24,467 --> 01:21:27,504
<i>Now, that is some insightful chatter,
Ben.</i>

1270
01:21:27,707 --> 01:21:29,857
<i>Well, audience.</i>

1271
01:21:30,947 --> 01:21:34,178
<i>There's a moonbeam full
of pleasure in the unexpected.</i>

1272
01:21:34,347 --> 01:21:36,383
<i>But if you wanna make it
across that pond...</i>

1273
01:21:36,547 --> 01:21:38,742
<i>...don't let the fear
of hypothermia keep you...</i>

1274
01:21:38,907 --> 01:21:40,704
...from skating right on across it.

1275
01:21:40,867 --> 01:21:43,665
<i>If the thing opens up and starts
to swallow you...</i>

1276
01:21:43,827 --> 01:21:47,342
<i>...make sure you got a friend
out there...</i>

1277
01:21:47,547 --> 01:21:49,777
<i>...to throw you a rope.</i>

1278
01:21:57,947 --> 01:22:01,303
<i>- That's a cut.
- Now get these fuckers off my set.</i>

1279
01:22:01,467 --> 01:22:03,105
<i>Someone get me a soy latte.</i>

1280
01:22:03,267 --> 01:22:06,498
<i>Come on, people, I'm Dr. Dwayne.</i>

1281
01:22:07,987 --> 01:22:10,785
<i>- Holy shit, dude.
- That was insane.</i>

1282
01:22:10,947 --> 01:22:12,016
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

1283
01:22:12,787 --> 01:22:15,585
<i>- This trip was a good thing.
- Yeah.</i>

1284
01:22:15,747 --> 01:22:18,659
Thank you. Thanks.

1285
01:22:18,827 --> 01:22:20,863
<i>You know this,
but I'm gonna say it anyway.</i>

1286
01:22:21,027 --> 01:22:23,495
<i>You're the two best friends
a guy could ever have.</i>

1287
01:22:24,907 --> 01:22:25,896
<i>What the...?</i>

1288
01:22:26,067 --> 01:22:27,819
<i>Eat egg, you sappy bitch.</i>

1289
01:22:28,827 --> 01:22:29,942
<i>No, not my face.</i>

1290
01:22:30,107 --> 01:22:34,385
<i>Not my face.
It's my instrument, you bitch.</i>

1291
01:22:35,307 --> 01:22:36,945
<i>Did you see that?</i>

1292
01:22:37,107 --> 01:22:40,702
<i>This is an accomplishment, Joel.
You've got somebody afraid of you.</i>

1293
01:22:41,387 --> 01:22:43,343
<i>People fear me.</i>

1294
01:22:43,507 --> 01:22:45,384
<i>I like this.</i>

1295
01:22:46,827 --> 01:22:49,022
<i>I think we can go home now.</i>

1296
01:22:52,027 --> 01:22:53,779
<i>Ben, can we get serious
for a moment?</i>

1297
01:22:53,947 --> 01:22:55,824
<i>Absolutely, man, what's up?</i>

1298
01:22:56,067 --> 01:22:58,900
<i>- Do you think I look like Beyoncé?
- No.</i>

1299
01:22:59,067 --> 01:23:00,420
<i>- I mean, not in the eyes?
- No.</i>

1300
01:23:00,587 --> 01:23:01,656
<i>- The mouth?
- No.</i>

1301
01:23:01,827 --> 01:23:04,057
<i>Whatever, you don't know anything.</i>

1302
01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:06,544
<i>Get me a soy latte.</i>

1303
01:23:06,747 --> 01:23:09,500
<i>Son, you need to look at me
when I'm talking to you.</i>

1304
01:23:09,667 --> 01:23:13,296
<i>But Dr. Dwayne, I am looking at you.</i>

1305
01:23:13,507 --> 01:23:15,862
<i>Okay, I can't work like this.</i>

1306
01:23:16,027 --> 01:23:19,383
<i>Who the hell hired
the cockeyed sumbitch?</i>

1307
01:23:19,547 --> 01:23:21,981
<i>Oh, goddamn it, y'all, come on.</i>

1308
01:23:22,147 --> 01:23:23,580
<i>I'm Dr. Dwayne.</i>

1309
01:24:05,227 --> 01:24:06,819
A mark.

1310
01:24:22,867 --> 01:24:25,745
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

1311
01:24:26,307 --> 01:24:30,425
<i>I had a gay moment. I had
my first, my first gay moment.</i>

1312
01:24:30,587 --> 01:24:31,781
<i>Gibberish.</i>

1313
01:24:43,267 --> 01:24:46,384
<i>- You did not take an oath, retard.
- Yes, I did take an oath, with my...</i>

1314
01:24:46,547 --> 01:24:48,981
<i>You don't know everything.</i>

1315
01:24:59,707 --> 01:25:01,186
<i>F*** me.</i>

1316
01:25:01,627 --> 01:25:03,538
<i>I'm gonna back up one.</i>

1317
01:25:03,707 --> 01:25:05,618
Hold on.

1318
01:25:06,107 --> 01:25:08,496
<i>I'm a team player, here I go.</i>

1319
01:25:15,187 --> 01:25:16,700
How many was that?

1320
01:25:16,867 --> 01:25:19,540
Shit. Hold on.

1321
01:25:21,267 --> 01:25:23,019
<i>He was laughing.</i>

1322
01:25:23,187 --> 01:25:24,336
<i>Help her. Help her now.</i>

1323
01:25:24,507 --> 01:25:26,463
<i>All right, ready.</i>

1324
01:25:34,227 --> 01:25:36,821
<i>- Okay, cut, we'll pick it up.
- Sorry.</i>

1325
01:25:37,747 --> 01:25:40,307
<i>Grape... F***.
That was his fault.</i>

1326
01:25:40,467 --> 01:25:43,504
<i>Clueless?
Perhaps you meant...</i>

1327
01:25:47,067 --> 01:25:50,616
<i>...brilliant!
- No, I didn't mean...</i>

1328
01:25:53,907 --> 01:25:54,942
...brilliant.

1329
01:25:55,107 --> 01:25:57,667
<i>I will hurl my body out of this car,
I swear to God.</i>

1330
01:25:57,827 --> 01:26:00,421
<i>I mean it, I've always thought
about doing it.</i>

1331
01:26:00,587 --> 01:26:03,465
<i>Go ahead,
we're not moving anymore.</i>

1332
01:26:03,667 --> 01:26:05,464
<i>Do you understand what I mean?</i>

1333
01:26:05,627 --> 01:26:07,822
<i>What I'm talking about
when I say blow?</i>

1334
01:26:07,987 --> 01:26:09,818
You... What?

1335
01:26:13,427 --> 01:26:16,339
<i>I wasn't supposed to last that long.</i>

1336
01:26:16,907 --> 01:26:18,579
<i>I thought you were gonna cut me off.</i>

1337
01:26:28,947 --> 01:26:31,859
<i>- Mark.
- There isn't a cloud in the sky.</i>

1338
01:26:32,027 --> 01:26:36,657
<i>It's like a blank canvas,
full of hope and possibilities.</i>

1339
01:26:36,827 --> 01:26:40,661
<i>You know, my nana used to say
it was like a naked virgin...</i>

1340
01:26:40,827 --> 01:26:44,263
<i>...waiting to be ploughed
from behind...</i>

1341
01:26:44,427 --> 01:26:46,622
<i>...while playing with her boobies.</i>

1342
01:26:46,787 --> 01:26:48,698
<i>Maybe tickling her anus.</i>

1343
01:26:48,867 --> 01:26:50,459
Okay.

1344
01:26:52,627 --> 01:26:54,265
<i>Camera set?</i>

1345
01:26:56,147 --> 01:27:00,459
<i>When we get there, there's a certain
resident by the name of Dr. Dwayne.</i>

1346
01:27:00,667 --> 01:27:03,977
<i>Ever heard of him?
Ruined our friend's life.</i>

1347
01:27:12,627 --> 01:27:14,777
It's dirty.

1348
01:27:15,387 --> 01:27:16,706
<i>I don't like dirt.</i>

1349
01:27:16,867 --> 01:27:19,984
<i>Chitown, Joel, the Windy City.</i>

1350
01:27:20,147 --> 01:27:23,139
<i>But now we are just touring
God greens...</i>

1351
01:27:23,307 --> 01:27:25,218
<i>But now we are just touring God...</i>

1352
01:27:25,387 --> 01:27:28,299
<i>But now we are just touring
the earth of something.</i>

1353
01:27:28,467 --> 01:27:33,587
<i>- Cut.
- Well, we're okay, I guess.</i>

1354
01:27:38,427 --> 01:27:40,497
<i>All right. That's enough.</i>

1355
01:27:46,067 --> 01:27:48,627
<i>Can you pull this beast off
at the next exit?</i>

1356
01:27:48,787 --> 01:27:51,699
That is ridiculous.

1357
01:27:52,627 --> 01:27:54,618
<i>No problem.</i>

1358
01:28:07,627 --> 01:28:09,299
Hold for coughs.

1359
01:28:09,467 --> 01:28:12,982
<i>I smoked so many blunts last night.
All right.</i>

1360
01:28:16,827 --> 01:28:17,896
<i>Pull over right now!</i>

1361
01:28:18,067 --> 01:28:19,102
<i>A marker.</i>
