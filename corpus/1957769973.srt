1
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:07,331
Here we go, boys!

2
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:09,625
Let's go! Come on!

3
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:48,998
I know, Mom. I'm sorry.

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,081
No, you're right.

5
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,290
You're right.

6
00:01:53,292 --> 00:01:56,081
It's very frustrating.

7
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,458
No, she shouldn't
talk to you like that.

8
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,790
Okay.

9
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:06,956
No, I know, I know.
I know how he is.

10
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,706
Okay.

11
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,540
Me? Yeah, I'm good.

12
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:15,831
Well, the other night, I...

13
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,456
Okay.

14
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,581
No, yeah, that makes sense.

15
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,667
Okay. Bye. I'll see you soon.

16
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,667
Fuck!

17
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:35,833
Fuck.

18
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,123
Hello?

19
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:54,540
I had the thing again where
I thought I ran over a guy.

20
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:58,248
Did you run over a guy?

21
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,998
No.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,498
I mean, I don't know.

23
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,498
I felt like it. And I saw it.

24
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,540
You saw it?

25
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:12,248
No. I heard a noise
and it felt like something.

26
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,206
I saw it in my mind,
like, as clear as day.

27
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,581
Okay, you've had this same
intrusive thought four times

28
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,665
since we started meeting.
- Mm-hmm.

29
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,456
Now, what do you think the odds
are that you've actually run

30
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:28,206
over four people with your car
who then ran and hid from you?

31
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,040
What are the... What are the
real-world odds

32
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:32,415
that this has happened
to you four times?

33
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:37,415
No, I know, but maybe
this time. I mean...

34
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,415
It could happen, and people do
run people over with their cars.

35
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:43,081
And I was on the phone,
which I know is bad.

36
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,748
I shouldn't have done that.

37
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,917
- Who were you on the phone with?
- My mother.

38
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,040
What did your mom say?

39
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:58,873
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Then maybe we better.

40
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,373
But what about this?

41
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,165
What if we just solved
all the other problems

42
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:06,290
and worked on those problems
and then just ignore my mother?

43
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:08,456
Sure. Or we could talk
about your mother.

44
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:13,415
And then all those other things
might take care of themselves.

45
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:16,123
Fuck.

46
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,373
You suck.
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,123
You're, like,
the worst therapist.

48
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,831
Most likely, yeah.

49
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:31,748
I'm suffering.

50
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,873
Maybe you're not
suffering enough.

51
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,290
Why would you say that?
What does that mean?

52
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:38,956
Well, if you were in more pain,
and enough pain,

53
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,123
you might seek a real solution.

54
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,998
That's how some people
might view it.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,831
- But I'm here.
- Yes, you are.

56
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:49,125
I'm seeking a solution.
I come here and I talk to you.

57
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,956
- We're out of time.
- Good.

58
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,081
Come on.

59
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:19,623
I'm sorry to say this, but I'm
not finding anything here.

60
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,915
Shit. Are you sure?

61
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:26,040
Yes. Look. Is the left side
of your face...

62
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:27,456
That's where
you were having the issue?

63
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:28,748
Yeah, it's all along here.

64
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,415
- Yeah, well, that's here.
- Right.

65
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,165
And it looks great.

66
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,373
I've examined you.
- Okay, but what's this?

67
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,081
What's this right here?
See that?

68
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,706
- That?
- Mm-hmm.

69
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,248
- That's your jaw.
- Okay.

70
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,373
And it looks great.
It looks fantastic.

71
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,540
Okay, but maybe we should take
an X-ray from a different angle,

72
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:47,165
because I think...

73
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:50,540
Jeff, you've had two X-rays
in almost three weeks.

74
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:52,915
That's almost malpractice.

75
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:55,915
Okay, what about an MRI?
- MRI?

76
00:05:55,917 --> 00:06:00,081
Yeah, it's just a really weird
feeling all along here, and...

77
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,081
Is it painful?

78
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,581
No, it's not painful.

79
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,248
It's just... It's, like,
terrifying.

80
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,165
And I just know
there's something wrong here.

81
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:12,373
Do you want
something to be wrong?

82
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,331
- Hey, Bill.
- Invisible Man.

83
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,540
...I know, I know. I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

84
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:29,290
Look, I don't have much time.

85
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:30,706
Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.

86
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,498
I'm just... I'm never late,
all right?

87
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,706
- Look, you're here now.
- Okay.

88
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,206
Um, are you eating?

89
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,040
- No, just coffee.
- Okay. Do you mind if I eat?

90
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:39,623
'Cause I'm starving.
- No. It's fine.

91
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,456
Okay. Sorry.

92
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:44,206
I'm gonna have, uh, eggs...

93
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,331
Like, scrambled...
Lots of scrambled eggs.

94
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:51,331
Like four, cheddar cheese,
and white toast.

95
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,623
- Got it.
- Lots of eggs.

96
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,581
- Got it.
- Okay. Thank you.

97
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,956
Ugh, I'm really sorry.
It's not... I'm gonna...

98
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,331
- Go ahead and eat.
- Okay.

99
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,998
But you're not eating,
is the thing.

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,540
How you doing?
I haven't heard from you.

101
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,831
Um, I'm okay.
How are you doing?

102
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:10,248
Wife.
Teenage kid. Yankees.

103
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,915
You get to a meeting today?

104
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:13,706
Yeah, I went
to the one on third.

105
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,956
Oh, well, good meeting.

106
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,456
Yeah. They're a good group.

107
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,498
There's just that one guy
that drives me nuts.

108
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,456
He always says, um,
"I'm definitely an alcoholic,"

109
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,581
as though we're not alcoholics.

110
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,998
It really just makes me
a little nuts.

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,581
We used to have a guy
in my home group,

112
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:31,456
used to say,
"I'm Martin, the alcoholic."

113
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,623
- Right. He's like a superhero.
- Yeah.

114
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,456
But that's... that's what they
got to do to tell themselves.

115
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,790
They're just saying it
so they can hear it.

116
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,456
- Right. That makes sense.
- Okay.

117
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,498
So, good?

118
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,998
- In that respect. Yeah.
- Yeah.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,165
You coming up on what,
two and a half years?

120
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:52,498
Yeah. Three... Three
in November.

121
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,415
- Fucking A.
- Yeah.

122
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:56,706
- Son of a bitch.
- Yeah.

123
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,248
Well done.
- Feels good. Yeah.

124
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,998
- I'm proud of you.
- Oh, thank you, Bill. Thank you.

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,165
Well, I wouldn't have done it
without you, so...

126
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:06,667
Yeah, well, maybe.
Look, I found you a sponsee.

127
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:12,165
Oh, um...

128
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:14,206
See, right now,
I think that might be a lot.

129
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,290
- You're ready.
- No, it's not about being ready.

130
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:19,040
It's just today
I had, like, a lot.

131
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:21,331
- He's a drummer.
- Oh, he's a drummer.

132
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,498
That's fun. He's a drummer,
you're a drummer.

133
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,623
You're my drummer.
You're a drunk, he's a drunk.

134
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:29,790
We're gonna meet him
after the gig tonight.

135
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:31,456
That just feels
like a lot right now.

136
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:35,040
Look. Are we doing this,
or are we doing this?

137
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:36,623
No, we're doing it.
We're doing it.

138
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,165
I just think I'm
a little scrambled right now.

139
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,040
I'm busy, I guess,
is what I'm saying.

140
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:43,290
And taking on a sponsee
might be a little bit...

141
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:46,706
Okay.
I have a wife younger than me.

142
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,415
I got a teenage kid.

143
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:52,831
I got two grown kids,
three cats, and six sponsees.

144
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,331
And right now,
I'm not counting you.

145
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,206
You understand?
- Yeah.

146
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,123
Listen, you show up late.

147
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,333
I haven't heard from you.
You're teetering.

148
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,665
Look at me.

149
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:10,540
Either lean forward,
take the next step,

150
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:13,542
or lean back,
fall down a flight of stairs.

151
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,123
No, that makes sense.
Um...

152
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,790
Look, I know it's a lot.

153
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:25,248
Sponsoring another guy.
Not easy.

154
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,873
In fact, it's a giant pain
in the ass.

155
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,456
- I know.
- Like this.

156
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:32,331
And I'm sorry I was late.
- Don't worry about it.

157
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,415
That's not eggs.
We got to fix that.

158
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:35,665
No, no, no. It's okay.

159
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,415
It's okay. It's fine.
- You sure?

160
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,206
This actually looks really
good. Yeah, this is better.

161
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,831
Okay, look, I got to split, kid.

162
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,581
And I'll see you tonight.

163
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,206
Okay. Thanks, Bill.

164
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,290
Just take the next right action.

165
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:48,748
Okay. Perfect.

166
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,998
And call me more than never.

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,665
Okay. Will do. Thank you.

168
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,000
Um...

169
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,831
Hey. Maybe I'll get this to go.
Is that okay?

170
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,081
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it looks good.

171
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,831
I just... Something came up.

172
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,123
Thank you.

173
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,540
I know what I want.
Can I have four scrambled eggs?

174
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:30,831
Like, soft scrambled,
cheddar cheese,

175
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,040
and white toast, please.

176
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:34,958
Thank you.

177
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,665
Hey.
When are we going to Maine?

178
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,498
Oh-ah!

179
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,123
Oh.

180
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,123
Are we saying the full
two weeks? 'Cause, like...

181
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,415
I mean, that's such a long time.

182
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:52,206
I know, I know. I know.
I'm sorry. They're brutal.

183
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,748
I know.

184
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,165
Well, like, I don't know
how they feel about me.

185
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:59,665
And then your mom never lets me
help in the kitchen.

186
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:02,998
And then your aunts feel like
I don't ever want to help.

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,665
And then there's
the Kevin factor.

188
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,998
I know. That all checks out.
Kevin sucks.

189
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,706
He's like...

190
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,248
He's a tyrant.

191
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,248
I'm sorry, but I don't know.

192
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,873
Maybe we should just not go.
Fuck it.

193
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,206
Let's just not go this year.
We'll skip one year.

194
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,290
I'm... I'm just saying
for one week.

195
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:20,998
Well, I'm saying
let's just not go it all.

196
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,206
Full skip. Fuck it.

197
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,915
Jeff, we have to go.
It's your family.

198
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,123
It's every 4th of July.

199
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,873
I know, I know.
We're gonna go.

200
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,956
We'll go. We'll go for one week.
We'll go for one week.

201
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,456
We'll sleep in the tiny room.
We'll have sex in the tiny bed.

202
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,873
We'll deal with Kevin
when we get there.

203
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,498
Whatever. It'll be fine.

204
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,331
I hate myself.
My father hates me.

205
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,831
My mother hates you.
It's gonna be great.

206
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,500
Your mom hates me?

00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:34,665

208
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:39,498

214
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,040
- Hey.
- Hey. What's going on?

215
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:14,790
- It was a good one, right?
- Yeah.

216
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:17,706
It's good to hear them talk
about this stuff, you know?

217
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,540
Absolutely. It's crucial.
How you feeling?

218
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:23,873
- This second, I feel good.
- Okay, great.

219
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,873
I'm worried about tomorrow
when you leave.

220
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,373
- Right.
- Hey, I'll see you.

221
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,248
How am I supposed to keep
this shit up forever?

222
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,165
Well, you don't have to
keep it up forever.

223
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:33,623
Just get to tomorrow.

224
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,623
You can't get 10 years
in one day.

225
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,540
My friend got 10 years
in one minute.

226
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:39,748
He's still
serving it up in Rikers.

227
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,373
You see, that's a great
reminder how bad it can get.

228
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,081
It was a joke.
I was just kidding.

229
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,206
Well, I'm just saying,

230
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,373
keep a little gratitude
in your attitude.

231
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,790
When do I get to that point?

232
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,665
Well, I've been sober
about three years.

233
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:57,373
No, I'm talking the point
where I'm speaking

234
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,040
in bumper stickers.

235
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:02,831
- You two play nice.
- All right.

236
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,456
Thanks, Bill.

237
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,581
Look.

238
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,373
I don't really know you.
I mean, we just met tonight.

239
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,831
Right?
I mean, they sound silly.

240
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,581
It's very bumper stickery,
I admit,

241
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,248
but there's actually
a lot of wisdom in those things.

242
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,415
So until we have
more of a rapport,

243
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,206
I might just say
this silly stuff,

244
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,498
but there is
a lot of wisdom in it.

245
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,165
I just want to help you.
It helps me to help you.

246
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:23,831
Does that make sense?
- Okay. Okay.

247
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,290
I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, no.

248
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,831
- I get it. I get it.
- It's all right.

249
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,290
I get it. Thanks.

250
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:30,831
Thanks.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

251
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,998
Thank you.

252
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,831
So, how do we do this?
What do we do? How's this...

253
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,248
Oh, right. Okay, so we're gonna
exchange contact info.

254
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,706
I'll give you my number,
all that shit.

255
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,831
And you call me
if you feel like drinking.

256
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,665
What, we're gonna go
drink together?

257
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,456
You serious? No.

258
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,706
I'm your sponsor, so if you
feel like having a drink,

259
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,373
you call me, I help.

260
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,915
Okay. Right. Sorry.

261
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,998
All right, yeah.

262
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,998
I like you. You want a...
You want a ride or...?

263
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,998
- Yeah. You got wheels?
- Yeah. I have a car.

264
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,415
- I'll take a ride.
- Let's go.

265
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,165
Come on, buddy.
- What about this stuff?

266
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,498
This is...
We're the last ones out.

267
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,250
Take anything. There's...

268
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,206
Fuck the banana.

269
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:34,165
- Hey.
- Hey.

270
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,915
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

271
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:39,331
- Can't believe you live here.
- I do.

272
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,998
And you're getting in this bed
with me right now.

273
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,415
Yeah.

274
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:43,956
And we're gonna make sweet love?

275
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,206
- We are.
- Whoa.

276
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,706
And I'm gonna have one orgasm.

277
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,790
- Yeah.
- And you might also.

278
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:52,123
- We'll see.
- It's great.

279
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,831
- It's pretty great.
- Yeah.

280
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,206
Hey, man.
- Hey.

281
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,456
Come on in.

282
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:13,373
Okay.

283
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,123
Got the game on?

284
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,040
Yeah. Just watching the game.

285
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,833
Um...

286
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:27,665
Uh...

287
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:32,540
My mom was overweight.
- What's that?

288
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:34,248
Hi.

289
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,790
- We weren't doing anything.
- Okay.

290
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:39,248
- Beth, this is Bobby.
- Oh, hi.

291
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,873
We went to high school together.

292
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,748
What?

293
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,248
Uh, how was your run?

294
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,956
- It was good.
- Good.

295
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,665
Okay, I'm gonna go.

296
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,540
Oh.

297
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:50,873
Um, all right, Bob.

298
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,206
See ya.

299
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,748
I'll talk to you...
I'll call you.

300
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,915
Sure thing.

301
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:56,540
All right. Great.

302
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,206
Is that one of your...?

303
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,956
Yeah, he's... He's cuckoo.

304
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,290
It's nice that you're
helping him.

305
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,540
Yeah, I don't know.

306
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,581
Probably not, honestly,
but I'm trying.

307
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,581
Hey, do you know
when we're going to Maine?

308
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,790
'Cause there's some stuff
I need to figure out.

309
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,206
Um...

310
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,706
I'm saying let's not go.

311
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:22,415
I'm saying, like,
let's not go to Maine at all.

312
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:23,998
I mean, I'm not saying
let's not go.

313
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,373
I'm saying I'm excited.

314
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,956
Unless you don't want to go.
I don't know.

315
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:34,165
I'm gonna take a shower.

316
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:36,917
Oh. Okay. That's good.

317
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,706
What?

318
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,915
I saw you texting with Leah.

319
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:33,623
- You read my texts?
- No. No, I didn't read them.

320
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,998
I just...
I saw that you were texting

321
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,331
and I closed it
before I read anything.

322
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,415
You what?

323
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:43,042
Um...

324
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:48,373
You remember, um...
You remember Diana?

325
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,456
Princess Diana?

326
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,706
No.

327
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,831
My girlfriend,
Diana from Denver.

328
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,998
Oh, the one with the tits
and the mouth.

329
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,623
Right, right. Yeah.

330
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,206
All right, well, one time...
I never told you this,

331
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,415
but one time, she left
her phone unlocked.

332
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:06,706
And so I looked at her texts,
and I shouldn't have,

333
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:10,040
but she was describing me
to her best friend,

334
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:14,415
and she wrote,
"Jeff, he's, like, amazing,

335
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:16,123
and he's adorable,
and he's really funny.

336
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,915
I just find him
really unattractive."

337
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,706
That's terrible. What a cunt.

338
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,581
Thank you. But...

339
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,498
I guess...

340
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,248
when I saw you texting,
I-I thought of that,

341
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,873
and it made me realize, like,

342
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,623
there must be things you text
to your friends about me

343
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,498
that, I don't know,
you would never say to me.

344
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,456
And I guess I don't want
to make you say anything you

345
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,790
don't want to say, but I guess
I'm wondering, like, is...

346
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:43,125
I'm not happy 'cause
we never had a baby.

347
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,748
What?

348
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,165
I mean, we're fine,

349
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:54,081
and I'm attracted to you
and you're great.

350
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:58,373
But I think deep down,
or not even deep down,

351
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,581
I'm just unfulfilled.

352
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,831
I-I wanted to be a mom.

353
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,581
Beth...

354
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,081
But...

355
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,831
You never even, like,
talk about that anymore.

356
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:15,748
I thought you just, like,
stopped caring about that.

357
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,123
No, I-I didn't.

358
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,623
Why did you stop bringing it up?

359
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:25,081
I mean, you're great
and you're greatest,

360
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,748
and you're more than
I ever need, but...

361
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,248
And you're the best
husband ever. It's just...

362
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,748
Wait, you didn't give up
on being a mom.

363
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,917
You gave up on me being a dad.

364
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:44,667
You shouldn't people's texts.
You should ask them things.

365
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:56,083
So, what did you say
when Beth said this to you?

366
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:00,831
I said nothing.

367
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,248
Well, do you think she's right?

368
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,292
Do you think that
you can't be a father?

369
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,123
I don't know.

370
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:13,373
Well, can you picture it?
A kid?

371
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,415
I mean, you with a kid?

372
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,873
Yeah. I mean, there's the idea
of having a kid...

373
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:22,165
A guy or my little buddy,
and it's our guy, and...

374
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:24,998
And it's our family.

375
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
How's that feel?

376
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,873
It feels good.

377
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,208
And I want that.
I want her to be happy.

378
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,456
I don't know what to do.

379
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,081
It's not a surprise that
you're struggling with this.

380
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,790
I mean, you're contemplating
having a child

381
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:45,623
and you're somebody's child.

382
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,540
And my mom. Right?

383
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:50,206
My mom and my dad and
the problems with my parents.

384
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,665
And if I don't confront them,
I'll never be happy.

385
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:54,248
You don't have to do anything
you don't...

386
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,748
That you can't do, Jeff.

387
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,831
I mean, you and Beth
are doing fine.

388
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:01,040
Within your limits,
you could just...

389
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:03,917
But I don't want to do that.
I need to...

390
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,456
I have to do it... I have to go

391
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,581
and confront my parents
and get this shit off my chest.

392
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,292
I can't live like this.

393
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:17,123
What?
You don't think I'll do it?

394
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,873
You said I wasn't
suffering enough, right?

395
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,373
Okay, well, now
I'm suffering enough.

396
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,998
I want to do something,
so help me. Let's...

397
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,290
Let's do something about it.

398
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:27,623
Jeff, we... we talked about
confronting your parents

399
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,581
three years ago, right?

400
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:33,415
Now, every time you go to Maine,
you say you're gonna do it.

401
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:35,123
And when you come back,
you always tell me

402
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,748
that you were... you were having
too good a time

403
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,915
and you didn't want to...
You didn't want to ruin it.

404
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,206
No, I know.
That's what happened.

405
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,998
That's what has happened
in the past.

406
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,623
Right. So maybe it's better
that... that...

407
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,373
To just accept that
that's how you cope.

408
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,748
That's how you cope.

409
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,123
Maybe a step forward
would be to own it

410
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,290
and not to expect that you're
gonna do it in the first place.

411
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:55,748
Don't say you're gonna do it and
then set yourself up to fail.

412
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,083
Just...

413
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,831
You gave up on me, too.

414
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:04,706
Everybody in my fucking life
has given up on me.

415
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,456
What would AA say about that?

416
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,456
Oh, fuck you. I'm sitting here.

417
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,373
I'm trying to help.
I'm trying to do something.

418
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,206
I'm ready to confront
my parents. I want to do it.

419
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,456
And now you're not
even helping me.

420
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:18,623
You're out of time.

421
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,290
I have another patient.

422
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:22,956
I'm going to Maine on Tuesday.

423
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:25,456
- You're going?
- Yeah, I'm going alone.

424
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:27,998
- You're mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.

425
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,831
I love you.
That's why I have to go do this.

426
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,498
I have to go and confront
my parents

427
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,165
and say all this shit
that I've been holding inside,

428
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:34,748
all this shit
that's been destroying me.

429
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,581
I have to go say it. It's time.

430
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:39,206
- Don't you want my support?
- No. I mean, I-I do.

431
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,290
I love you,
but I've got to go alone,

432
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:43,415
because if you come,
it's gonna be the same.

433
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:44,873
I'll puss out.
I know I will.

434
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,040
And I have to get
out of this cycle.

435
00:24:46,042 --> 00:24:47,331
So I'm just gonna go there.

436
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,165
I'm gonna confront my parents.

437
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:50,665
I'm gonna kill my parents.
I'm gonna come back.

438
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:52,123
We're gonna make sweet love.

439
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,790
You're gonna get pregnant,
have a baby.

440
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,331
You'll be the happiest
woman on Earth.

441
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,123
And eventually I'll die.
And then you'll die.

442
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,956
And then all our little
dumb kids will die.

443
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,456
- Sounds good.
- Okay, great.

444
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:04,415
Are you gonna fuck my friends
while I'm gone?

445
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:06,665
I mean, I would
if you went or not.

446
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:09,206
Great. Not really, right?

447
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:28,540
There are many ways in which
we use the term "self,"

448
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:31,165
and not all of these terms
are illusory.

449
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:33,790
I can think of myself
as a writer or a father

450
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:35,998
or a customer in a store.

451
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,665
No one is simply a human being.

452
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:41,248
You're a lover, a window washer,

453
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,165
massage therapist.

454
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:47,292
An elderly woman.
A dead woman. A ghost.

455
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:22,083
Hey, Dad.

456
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,290
Your mom's inside.

457
00:26:27,292 --> 00:26:29,248
Okay. Thanks.

458
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:41,540
Um...

459
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:44,040
- How was the ride?
- Um...

460
00:26:44,042 --> 00:26:46,831
Good, good.
I took 91 part of the way.

461
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:48,915
To Merritt. Thank you.
- Thank you.

462
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:50,915
- All right.
- I got to pee, man.

463
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:52,623
Will you get the bags
out of the back, please?

464
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:54,208
I'll just go around.

465
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,375
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey, Needle Dick!

466
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:03,625
Hi, Jeffy.

467
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,583
He took 91 the whole way.

468
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,206
- Jeffy!
- Hey.

469
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:27,498
- Oh! New York!
- Hey. No, Kev. I gotta...

470
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,956
- What's up?
- Hey.

471
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:30,998
How's Faggot Town, faggot?

472
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,665
- Faggot Town is fine, thanks.
- Yeah?

473
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,248
How do you like
the Yankees this year?

474
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,956
- I hate the Yankees.
- They fucking suck!

475
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:37,290
Well, they're in for...

476
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:39,498
Never mind that.
Take a look at this, huh?

477
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,790
25 years old.
25 fucking years old.

478
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:43,290
I stole it from her uncle

479
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:44,706
Her grandfather
brought it over on the boat.

480
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:46,873
It's some family treasure
or some shit.

481
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,790
You and I are killing
this bottle tonight, kid.

482
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,498
- I don't drink, Kevin.
- Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

483
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,998
Smell that.
- I smell it. I can smell it.

484
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,873
- It's 25 years old!
- I know.

485
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:55,290
Hey. Hey.

486
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:58,831
How come Michael Jackson
likes 25-year-olds?

487
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,248
I don't know. Why?

488
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,415
'Cause there's 20 of them.

489
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,373
- 5 year olds.
- Oh!

490
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:07,873
Fuckin' kid-fucker!

491
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,873
Hey, those kids knew
what they were getting into.

492
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:11,581
May he suffer in Hell.

493
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:13,123
All right! All right!

494
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,456
All right, all right!
Everybody outside!

495
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:17,248
I'm cooking in here.

496
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,040
We're glad to have you,
but get the hell out.

497
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,748
It's a beautiful day. Go, go.

498
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,706
Hi, hon.

499
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:25,206
Hey, Mom... and Dad.

500
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:29,040
Um, I need to talk to you guys
at some point this week.

501
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:32,206
- What? What's up?
- No, not now.

502
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:33,873
Just at some point
during the week.

503
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:37,040
- Not now. What?
- No, no, it's nothing.

504
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:39,415
Just... I just,
at some point later in the week,

505
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,581
I thought... I wanted to
just talk about some stuff.

506
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:43,706
Oh, okay. What's up?

507
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:45,081
Oh, okay.

508
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:46,748
Well, all right.

509
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,915
I guess I've been grappling.
With some issues.

510
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:52,415
Where's Beth?

511
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:54,498
Beth's not coming this year.

512
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,081
- Ohhh!
- But that's not...

513
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,373
- No, no.
- Okay. Yeah.

514
00:28:58,375 --> 00:28:59,748
Loud and clear.

515
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,748
I'm sorry, honey.
We saw this coming.

516
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,790
Tricia!
- Yeah, Shirles?

517
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:05,706
- Jeff and Beth!
- Aw!

518
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,331
Yeah!

519
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:11,081
You make sure that cunt doesn't
get a nickel, Jeffrey!

520
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,998
No, that...

521
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,956
First of...
That's really hurtful,

522
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:17,373
but it's not...
Everything's fine with Beth.

523
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:19,706
Well, what's up, then?
You got a bug in your bonnet?

524
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:21,498
Yeah.

525
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,040
I mean, I guess I just want to
talk about some stuff, you know?

526
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:26,998
- So talk. Here we are.
- Okay.

527
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,790
Well, in my life...
- Darlene! That's for later.

528
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:31,540
But I thought you
wanted it put out.

529
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:33,290
No. Did I say that?

530
00:29:33,292 --> 00:29:35,331
Back.

531
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:37,083
Sorry, honey. What?

532
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:43,040
I just. I wanted to talk about
how we never share any, like,

533
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:44,581
feelings in the family,

534
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:48,081
and I feel like you
never show me, like, love.

535
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:50,415
- What?
- No, no, it's fine.

536
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:51,998
It's just, like,

537
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,956
I don't know the last time
we said "I love you."

538
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,915
And I actually don't think
we've ever said "I love you."

539
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:58,581
And like, I can't remember
the last time we hugged.

540
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,456
I feel like we've never
really even hugged.

541
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:02,290
And at this point in my life,
I just feel like...

542
00:30:02,292 --> 00:30:04,290
You need a hug?
Here, come here, come here.

543
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:05,665
Well, it's not that
I need a hug, I just...

544
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:07,206
- Yeah. Come here.
- Oh.

545
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:09,123
Okay. There you go. Okay?

546
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:11,498
You okay now?

547
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,165
Yeah. That's go... I feel good.

548
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:17,123
Thank you. Sorry.

549
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:37,373
Yeah, baby.

550
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,748
Oh, yeah!

551
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,331
What? The char is killing me.

552
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:46,415
Ah, you're at
the wrong end of it.

553
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:48,208
What is that, rubber?

554
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:52,542
Sounds like a...
Smells like a tire fire.

555
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,831
They get bigger as they
get older, you know.

556
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:59,790
They do?

557
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:02,206
- They just get longer.
- They do get... They get long.

558
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,873
I love when you're bad.

559
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:13,415
- Oh!
- Yeah. Beautiful.

560
00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:26,081
Here you go.

561
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,790
What the fuck are these?

562
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:29,623
Thought that's what you wanted.

563
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:32,456
No, I wanted the...
The long ones with the...

564
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:35,123
With the... with the bumps
in 'em... the crunchy ones.

565
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,706
These are... These are...
Where'd you get these, at BJ's?

566
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:39,123
Here, here!

567
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:41,915
Scratch tickets,
scratch tickets.

568
00:31:41,917 --> 00:31:44,998
Grab a scratch ticket.
Here you go.

569
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,667
There you go, buddy.

570
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:00,206
This one's for you.

571
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:03,248
No, sir. More for me.

572
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,623
How's New York?

573
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:07,706
New York's okay.

574
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,498
How is, uh...

575
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,331
What is it, the plumbing store?

576
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,498
No. That was
three jobs ago, kid.

577
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,831
Oh, right.

578
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,540
A guy caught me stealing copper,

579
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:20,206
selling it to another store.

580
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:23,581
- Jesus.
- Rules are meant to be broken.

581
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:25,415
Yeah.

582
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:28,873
Well, actually, I think
it might be the opposite, but...

583
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:31,956
- I keep getting that wrong.
- It's all right.

584
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:34,456
How much money you make
stealing copper from one store

585
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:36,081
and selling it to another?

586
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:39,956
Oh. More than you'd think.
Copper's a commodity.

587
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,790
Changes price every day.

588
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:45,831
So I'd steal low, sell high.

589
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:48,623
- That's good. Smart.
- Yeah.

590
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:53,123
Well, if you're gonna suck
a cock, make it a big one.

591
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:56,165
If you don't need to come,
you can't have the cake.

592
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:58,542
Takes two dicks
to make a cunt fat.

593
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,998
- You got a pair of tits...
- Takes, uh...

594
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,248
Shit.
- Oh.

595
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,165
- You got it.
- No, mine's nothing.

596
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:09,706
- Here comes your cousin Brenda.
- Hey, everybody.

597
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:11,498
- Bren-Bren.
- Hi.

598
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,040
This is Naomi,
my friend from work.

599
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:16,040
She's staying with us this week.

600
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:19,456
Naomi, that's my Aunt Tricia.
There's Aunt Darlene.

601
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:22,498
That's Uncle Chris.
Shirley, his wife.

602
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,831
It's their party.

603
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:26,248
That's Tony. He's Italian.

604
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,540
Don't know Marion's boyfriend.

605
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:31,623
Uh, that's Gramps.
It's his place.

606
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:35,373
And the uncles... Kevin, Mark.
- Hey. What's up, guy?

607
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:37,956
Sitting with him's Jeff,
my cousin.

608
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:40,748
And, uh, there's kids
running around. So...

609
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,956
My... My dad died and my mom
don't come around no more.

610
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:44,915
So... Everybody!

611
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:47,165
I brought Naomi here
to get some nice, fresh air.

612
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:48,998
She, uh...

613
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,248
Might as well
get this out in the open.

614
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,706
Her husband just died recently.
- Aw!

615
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:55,081
Thought you were gonna say
she was black.

616
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:57,123
Oh, shut the fuck up, stupid.

617
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:58,540
That's obvious.
- Fuck you.

618
00:33:58,542 --> 00:34:00,415
Well, if it helps,
I'm half black.

619
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:02,623
It's okay.
Kevin's half retarded.

620
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:08,040
- Which half is black?
- My father.

621
00:34:08,042 --> 00:34:10,290
Ah, you know what that means.

622
00:34:10,292 --> 00:34:13,331
She got a big cock.

623
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,873
- Welcome to the family, hon.
- Oh.

624
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:18,248
Yeah. To each his own,
I always say.

625
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,623
Grab a plate.

626
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,290
Come on, everybody, eat.

627
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,748
- Let's go get some food.
- Come on. Eat.

628
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,790
Time to eat.

629
00:34:25,792 --> 00:34:28,373
Come on. Darlene,
where are the knives and forks?

630
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:30,081
You didn't tell me
to get the knives and forks.

631
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,373
Grab me a burger. Make sure you
don't take all the butter.

632
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:34,206
- Thank you.
- I grilled some hot dogs, too.

633
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:36,706
I just need one dog.

634
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:39,040
Look, I, uh...

635
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:40,667
Can I get a plate over here?

636
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,583
Jeff, over here.

637
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:51,456
Right next to Naomi.

638
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,873
Naomi, Jeff's married
but not for long.

639
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:56,165
You got to get back
in there, Jeff.

640
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:59,290
Her husband's dead.

641
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:01,498
I'm happily married, by the way.

642
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,081
Yeah, I just lost my husband
like six months ago,

643
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,456
So I'm not, you know.

644
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:08,958
All right. I'm sorry.
Sorry about them, too.

645
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,623
Could you pass me those?
- Oh, yeah, totally.

646
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:13,956
Yeah.
- Thanks very much.

647
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:15,583
Appreciate it.

648
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,415
- Pass the ketchup.
- Do you need more chips?

649
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,998
Can we get more chips, please?

650
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,748
Yeah, you want more chips?
All right, darling.

651
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,456
Why are... Why are we
out of buns?

652
00:35:40,292 --> 00:35:41,958
Thanks.

653
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:04,748
- Hey, Grandpa.
- Hmm?

654
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,956
I kind of got to piss.

655
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:08,415
Go off the side.

656
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:10,083
Water's right there.

657
00:36:19,917 --> 00:36:21,667
It's all right, I'll just wait.

658
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:26,542
Lucky bastard.

659
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:58,623
Thanks.

660
00:36:58,625 --> 00:37:01,081
How'd you do?

661
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:03,456
Two sunburns. No fish.

662
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:04,958
Yeah?

663
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:12,248
Almost dinner?

664
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,708
Almost.

665
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,665
I love that story.
Tell it again.

666
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:31,123
Yeah, and the mother dropped it.

667
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,790
It broke like a...

668
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,665
Oh, come on!

669
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:40,873
Yeah, when Mark worked down
at the quarries,

670
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,456
there was those two black guys.

671
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:44,415
And... Pardon me, Naomi.

672
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:46,248
And Mark and them
got caught swimming

673
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,290
during work in their underwears.

674
00:37:48,292 --> 00:37:50,165
Fags.

675
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,081
No, no. No, but one
of them was, though.

676
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:54,706
Mark, didn't you say you felt
kind of weird in your underwears

677
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:57,040
'cause one of the black guys
was gay or something?

678
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:58,373
Sorry, Naomi.

679
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:00,831
It's really okay
that the guys were black.

680
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:03,331
See? I told you she was cool.

681
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:05,706
Hey, Naomi, want to hear a joke?

682
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:07,040
- No, not really.
- No, no,

683
00:38:07,042 --> 00:38:08,623
it's a really good joke.

684
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:10,290
Hey, Tony, you got
one of these for me?

685
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:12,498
Oh, yeah,
I brought you one, kid.

686
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,248
Thought you said you were sober.

687
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,790
Sober? Smoking cigars?

688
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:17,665
You're gonna be
doing shots in a few minutes.

689
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:20,956
How about this? How about this?

690
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:24,498
Jeff comes in today,
says to Dad and me,

691
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,748
"Hey, Ma, can we talk?

692
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:30,290
I don't feel like you love me.
I got issues.

693
00:38:30,292 --> 00:38:32,706
We never share
our feelings enough.

694
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:34,498
You don't love me."

695
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:37,998
That's that New York.
That's that...

696
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,665
That's that fucking
New York in him.

697
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,331
"You never hug me," he goes.

698
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:45,706
I'm like, "I'm your mother.
I don't love you?"

699
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:48,331
I did your laundry 18 years.
- That's right.

700
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,498
- Did your dishes.
- That's right.

701
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,581
Cleaned your skid-marked
underwears.

702
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:56,665
He used to piss his pants.

703
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,373
And I don't love him?
- Shame on you.

704
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:01,290
That's how it is with them now.
No fucking...

705
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:04,165
No appreciation,
no fucking tradition.

706
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:07,081
Getting sober,
getting fucking gay.

707
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,581
Getting sober.

708
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:11,748
A man drinks with his family,
with his friends.

709
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,290
Makes love to a woman.
Woman has his child.

710
00:39:15,292 --> 00:39:18,706
She loves that child.
The child loves the mother back.

711
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:21,373
Not no fucking more of the
fucking therapy.

712
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:24,248
Nothing decent no more.
Fucking New York.

713
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,956
That's correct.

714
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:28,665
Question isn't whether
your mother loves you, Jeffrey.

715
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:34,123
You can't even scientifically
ask that question.

716
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:36,081
Question is...

717
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:39,456
do you honor your mother?

718
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:41,998
Do you honor your father?

719
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,833
Grace of God.

720
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:49,083
My son knows I love him.

721
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:54,292
Just like I know
my dad loves me.

722
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:02,748
I said the whole thing,
basically.

723
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:06,540
I mean, right when I got here.
But it was just...

724
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:08,665
- Was it unsatisfying?
- Very.

725
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,040
They didn't really listen.

726
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:11,498
They just waved it off

727
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,831
like I said we didn't
have enough butter,

728
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:14,956
then they ended
the conversation.

729
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:16,456
I don't know what to do.

730
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,706
Listen, Jeff,
I'm at home right now.

731
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:21,290
- Oh, okay. Oh.
- Yeah.

732
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:22,956
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

733
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:25,123
Look, we'll talk
about this when you get back.

734
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:27,417
Yeah. All right. Sorry.
Thank you.

735
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,790
Hey, kid. How's Maine?
You get a lobster?

736
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:38,456
Hey, Bill. No, it sucks.
I don't want to be here.

737
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:41,081
It's the same shit.
Nothing changes.

738
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,831
They're drunks,
they're assholes.

739
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:44,873
And honestly, I can't even
believe I'm in this family,

740
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,498
except for Mark.
- Yeah, yeah.

741
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,748
Do... Do you feel like
you're gonna drink?

742
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,248
No, not at all.

743
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,081
Okay, then, you know,
do your best.

744
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,956
Do the stuff we talked about.

745
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,956
Call me if you're in trouble,
you know?

746
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:57,956
All right. Yeah. Thanks.

747
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:00,123
And when you feel like
picking up a drink,

748
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:04,498
pick up the phone, right now,
and call a newcomer.

749
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,873
Call your sponsee.

750
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:09,165
Stay with it.
- Yeah, you bet.

751
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:10,708
Thanks, Bill.

752
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:37,498
- That's nice.
- Thank you.

753
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,083
It is nice.

754
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:42,456
Do you always play
in the morning?

755
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:45,998
I do here.
They're all sleeping.

756
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,540
Drunks.

757
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:51,040
You don't want them
to hear you play?

758
00:42:51,042 --> 00:42:52,581
They don't want to hear me play.

759
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:55,623
I'm sure they'd love
to hear you play.

760
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:57,665
Uh...

761
00:42:57,667 --> 00:43:00,581
I don't think so.

762
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:03,456
They're not, uh, piano people.
- Mm.

763
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:12,623
Knock that shit off.
Fucking jazz. Yuck.

764
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:15,706
Jazz... more like jizz.

765
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:17,873
Coffee. Fucking coffee.

766
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:19,917
Naomi?
- No. No, thanks.

767
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,956
There you go.
The reviews are in.

768
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:28,873
Wow.
You really want to play, huh?

769
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:30,706
I do. It's what I do.

770
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,248
- There you go, buddy.
- Hey. Thank you, Uncle Mark.

771
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,956
No problem.

772
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:37,290
How are you his uncle?
Is it just, like, a nickname?

773
00:43:37,292 --> 00:43:39,123
You guys look the same age.

774
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:41,623
No, I'm his uncle for real.

775
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:43,331
- He's a mistake.
- Oh.

776
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:44,915
See, that's my father.

777
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:47,123
His grandfather.

778
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,123
And your mother?

779
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:50,581
That's her right there.

780
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:53,206
Yeah. She's dead, though.

781
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:54,748
Very dead.

782
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,248
She's, like, a skull now.

783
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,831
Maybe some dust. Worms.

784
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:02,165
- That's your mother?
- I didn't know her.

785
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:03,998
She died when I was three.

786
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,706
Jezebel!

787
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:08,581
Jeff's dad there, Chris...

788
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:10,165
That's my older brother.

789
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:11,998
Older by a lot.

790
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,665
He raised me, really, alongside
this bird turd.

791
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:18,123
We were drinking buddies
since we were 10 and 12.

792
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:19,665
But he's a quitter.

793
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:21,165
- Yeah.
- No, sir.

794
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:24,540
He's triple-A or whatever.
He's better off.

795
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:26,040
Let me tell you,
if this cock-sucker

796
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:28,165
was still drinking,
he'd be dead.

797
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:31,123
- Really?
- Probably.

798
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:33,331
This kid was way out of order.

799
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:35,873
Fuckin' psycho when he drank.

800
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:40,123
He'd put away
a quarter rum, case of beer.

801
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:42,706
This one time,
we were in Harvard Square...

802
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:45,581
- Oh!
- ...harassing these fat chicks.

803
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:48,040
Jeff sees a
"Boston Globe" truck...

804
00:44:48,042 --> 00:44:50,540
You know,
one of the big, boxy ones.

805
00:44:50,542 --> 00:44:52,040
He jumps on the back

806
00:44:52,042 --> 00:44:54,040
like a garbage man,
screaming and yelling.

807
00:44:54,042 --> 00:44:55,873
- What were you screaming?
- Like, "Extra, extra.

808
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:57,956
Read all about it."
But he's got the story wrong.

809
00:44:57,958 --> 00:45:00,081
That's not right.
The fat girls were chasing us

810
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:01,873
'cause I stole
one of their book bags.

811
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:04,165
Why did you steal
their book bags?

812
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:05,873
You want to hear
the story or not?

813
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:09,165
They were fat Harvard girls.
We were harassing them.

814
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:10,998
They were like,
"You dumb fucking drunks.

815
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,206
You're so fucking stupid."

816
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:18,040
And Jeff was like, "Fuck you.
I go to Harvard, too.

817
00:45:18,042 --> 00:45:20,123
Look at all my books
in my book bag."

818
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:22,248
And Jeff took off
and started running.

819
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,165
They came after us.

820
00:45:24,167 --> 00:45:25,665
They were fast
for a bunch of fat chicks.

821
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:26,956
They were fast.

822
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:29,206
Fast and fat.
They ran like Babe Ruth.

823
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:33,123
Jeff jumps on the "Globe" truck.

824
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:35,123
"Extra, extra.
Read all about it."

825
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:38,165
"Four Fat
Harvard Girls Lose Book Bag."

826
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:40,123
The truck takes off
into traffic.

827
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:43,331
I'm runnin', trying to hop on
like a hobo on a freight train.

828
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:46,415
The fucking truck starts up
the ramp onto St or row Drive.

829
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:49,123
- I jumped off.
- Did you get hurt?

830
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:50,581
Oh, yeah. Very badly.

831
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:53,456
He was in the hospital
for a month.

832
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:55,873
So, that's when
you quit drinking?

833
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:57,456
Mnh-mnh.

834
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:59,331
That's when I started
eating pills.

835
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:01,081
Yeah.
Remember the other time?

836
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:03,290
When the cab driver gave us
tickets to the Bruins game?

837
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:04,706
- The ticket cab guy.
- Yeah.

838
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:06,790
We were on our way
to the Faneuil Hall.

839
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:09,248
Right? And the guy's just like,
"I have two tickets"...

840
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:13,665
And the fear in my life
at every turn, Darlene.

841
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:15,706
You're just fucking
ungrateful, is all.

842
00:46:15,708 --> 00:46:19,456
You got no sense of grace,
is all.

843
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:23,581
You know what, Darlene?
I'm sorry your husband died.

844
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:25,290
And I'm sorry that my man
is stronger

845
00:46:25,292 --> 00:46:26,956
and is still with me today.

846
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:29,540
And I'm sorry that Jerome
couldn't handle his liquor...

847
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:30,956
- How dare you?
- ...and that he succumbed.

848
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:32,415
How dare you?!

849
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:34,248
Perhaps if you'd been
a better wife, huh?

850
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,706
That's the only difference
between me and you...

851
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:39,956
Is Kevin comes from money and
Jerome had to work for a living.

852
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:41,206
What fucking money?

853
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:42,706
Let the fuck go of me.

854
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:45,206
You pissed it all away,
and it's all our fault?

855
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:47,248
I'm just trying to help you.
- Don't talk to me, Darlene.

856
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,248
I'm just trying to help you.

857
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,706
You're not.
You're a fucking meddler.

858
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:53,498
- No, I'm not!
- Yeah. You're a meddler.

859
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,956
- I love you, though.
- I don't want your fucking love.

860
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:57,998
- Oh, come on.
- God!

861
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,667
Oh, honey, are you okay?

862
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,415
All right, all right,
all right, all right,

863
00:47:05,417 --> 00:47:07,206
all right, all right,
all right, all right.

864
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:09,123
It's 2021!

865
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:10,748
I'll hit a woman.

866
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,415
I'll hit a fucking woman.
- Knock it off!

867
00:47:12,417 --> 00:47:14,125
Knock it off!
- Don't think...

868
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:17,915
Look, I'm not above
slugging my sister-in-law,

869
00:47:17,917 --> 00:47:19,956
but her mother's a real pig.

870
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:23,748
- Come on, guys. It's breakfast.
- Oh, fine.

871
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:53,081
You don't put
the fucking post in that close,

872
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:54,498
or the fucking net
won't be high enough!

873
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,123
It's got to be taut.

874
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:58,790
It's got to be fucking taut,
or it's gonna be too low.

875
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,165
Yeah, but you make it taut
on the other side,

876
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:02,915
you fucking asshole.
- Shut the fuck up.

877
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:05,873
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
All right, all right.

878
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:07,998
Listen, to stem the tide
of further arguments,

879
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,873
I'm gonna pick the teams,
all right?

880
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:11,706
So, Darlene, honey,
you're with me.

881
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:14,415
Uh, Naomi, you're with me.

882
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:16,956
We need a guy.
Tony, you're with us.

883
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:18,915
We've got to split up
Jeff and Mark,

884
00:48:18,917 --> 00:48:20,415
so Mark, you play with us.

885
00:48:20,417 --> 00:48:23,165
On Jeff's team,
Kevin and the girls, right?

886
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:26,623
Tricia. Brenda. All right,
let's play nice, everyone.

887
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:28,581
Hit it to Darlene.

888
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:32,290
Hey, Kevin, shut the fuck up.

889
00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:35,415
Zero.

890
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:37,456
When's the other team
showing up?

891
00:48:37,458 --> 00:48:39,375
I got it. There it is.

892
00:48:42,292 --> 00:48:44,831
Oh!

893
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:46,248
I bet you'd love it
if I broke my ankle.

894
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,623
Awww!

895
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:50,458
Now you're in trouble.
Come on, Tony.

896
00:48:52,417 --> 00:48:54,750
- Tony, hit the fucking ball.
- There we go. All right.

897
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:58,833
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

898
00:49:02,792 --> 00:49:04,540
- Yeah! Yeah, baby.
- Fucking asshole.

899
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:05,998
I'm on your team.

900
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,373
I know, but that was
an important point.

901
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:08,748
No, play.
All right, all right. Play.

902
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,165
I haven't missed the ball
all day.

903
00:49:10,167 --> 00:49:11,458
Let's go.

904
00:49:15,417 --> 00:49:17,373
- Point.
- Yes!

905
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:19,831
- That's out!
- We're back, baby!

906
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:21,206
On the losers' team.

907
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,456
Loser.

908
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:24,290
Kick 'em all.

909
00:49:24,292 --> 00:49:26,498
Fucking idiot.

910
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,373
Jesus, Kevin.

911
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:31,665
That fucking hurts.
- You're fucking kidding.

912
00:49:31,667 --> 00:49:33,583
Come on, Bren. Come on, Bren.

913
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:39,623
Oh, shit.

914
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:41,498
What the fuck? Dude!

915
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:45,290
What the fuck are you doing?

916
00:49:45,292 --> 00:49:47,748
You're a fucking piece of shit.

917
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,831
You fucking idiot.

918
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:51,290
- What the fuck? Relax.
- What are you doing?

919
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:53,248
Yeah, a fucking sex crime
is fucking fun,

920
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:54,540
you fucking dick weed.
- Have a fucking drink

921
00:49:54,542 --> 00:49:56,540
and get a sense of humor,
fucking...

922
00:49:56,542 --> 00:49:58,081
- Shake it off, shake it off.
- You're all right.

923
00:49:58,083 --> 00:49:59,623
No, no, I'm not all right.
I'm not all right.

924
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:01,248
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- He's a fucking asshole.

925
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:02,915
Where are you going?
I'm fucking done. I'm done.

926
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,706
- It's the fucking rubber match.
- What rubber?

927
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:06,248
It's first game.

928
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,915
It's just something you say.

929
00:50:36,917 --> 00:50:40,706
- You take it too far.
- Oh, shut up. Who's asking you?

930
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:42,415
- All right.
- What do you mean, you quit?

931
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:44,040
The teams are even now.
We can keep playing.

932
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:45,498
We just started.

933
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,915
- I need a beer.
- You can't let them...

934
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:48,456
All right. Who wants
to go one-on-one?

935
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:50,581
Darlene, can you get me a beer?

936
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:35,040
...the alcohol content,

937
00:52:35,042 --> 00:52:38,248
but nobody can fucking hit
a ball more than twice.

938
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:40,540
It's called volley.
You got to...

939
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,748
Hey! Hey!

940
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,831
Knock that shit off.

941
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:58,456
Trying to talk over here.

942
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:04,415
Jeff, at least play a song
or something.

943
00:53:04,417 --> 00:53:07,706
Play a song. Enough with the
fucking Liberace faggot shit.

944
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:09,998
My God.
- Yeah, Jeff, come on.

945
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,956
Play something we all like.
Let's have a sing-along.

946
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:14,583
Oh, yeah!

947
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:19,706
- "Piano Guy."
- "Piano Guy"!

948
00:53:19,708 --> 00:53:23,123
Yeah! Start us off.

949
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:43,206
The fuck's his problem?

950
00:53:43,208 --> 00:53:44,873
It's 'cause you hit him
in the cock.

951
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:46,915
Fuck you.

952
00:53:46,917 --> 00:53:48,540
Fuck you who?

953
00:53:48,542 --> 00:53:50,623
Fuck all of you.

954
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:54,123
Fuck everybody in this room,
including me.

955
00:53:54,125 --> 00:53:57,206
Fuck you that I can't... that...

956
00:53:57,208 --> 00:54:01,081
And fuck me that
I can't even fucking...

957
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:04,831
I hate it here. I fuck...
Fuck this.

958
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:06,873
Who the fuck shat in your soup?

959
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:09,123
- Fuck you, Kevin.
- Told you it was you.

960
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:10,665
Fuck you, Tony.

961
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:12,540
Fuck you and fuck you.

962
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:14,915
And fuck you, Brenda.

963
00:54:14,917 --> 00:54:16,540
And fuck you, Dad.

964
00:54:16,542 --> 00:54:18,540
You watch your mouth, Jeffrey.

965
00:54:18,542 --> 00:54:20,498
Fuck you, Mom! Fuck you.

966
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,415
You better pray forgiveness.
You said fuck your mother.

967
00:54:23,417 --> 00:54:25,290
Shut up, Darlene. Shut up.

968
00:54:25,292 --> 00:54:28,290
I'm sorry, but just shut
your stupid fucking mouth.

969
00:54:28,292 --> 00:54:31,290
I mean, what are you doing here?
Where are your kids?

970
00:54:31,292 --> 00:54:33,081
Where are all your fucking kids?

971
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:36,415
And where were you?
What kind of people are you?

972
00:54:36,417 --> 00:54:39,248
What kind of people are we?
I'm with you.

973
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:43,456
I fucking hate myself, too.
This is why I didn't have a kid.

974
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:45,123
I don't want to fucking
bring a kid into this

975
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:47,331
and subject them to what
I fucking went through.

976
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:49,623
Maybe I'll have a kid, but I'm
not gonna bring him up here.

977
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:52,915
You're fucking drunks.
- Oh, oh, okay.

978
00:54:52,917 --> 00:54:55,456
'Cause you're fucking
New York and you're...

979
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,873
You're better than us now.

980
00:54:56,875 --> 00:55:00,581
Yes, I am better than you,
which sucks.

981
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:02,831
I'm fucking embarrassed
by you, Kevin.

982
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,915
And I wish I wasn't.
You're my uncle.

983
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:08,833
I need you to be better than me.
And you're my father.

984
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,081
And you're my mother.

985
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:16,123
And what kind of mother are you?

986
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:19,081
You're like a fucking spider
that keeps everybody here

987
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:20,998
all wrapped up coming to you,

988
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,498
and you feed them
fucking drinks,

989
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,456
so they're all the worst
version of themselves.

990
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:25,956
So everyone's fucking miserable.

991
00:55:25,958 --> 00:55:27,748
They don't even realize it.

992
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:32,331
They're too drunk to realize it.
That's why I'm miserable.

993
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:35,248
This is why I don't...
I didn't bring Beth here.

994
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,165
I don't want
to subject Beth to this

995
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:41,581
'cause she deserves better,
and you guys don't deserve Beth.

996
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:43,040
I thought I came up here

997
00:55:43,042 --> 00:55:44,706
to ask you to love me
the way a mother should.

998
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,042
I think I came up here
to say fuck you.

999
00:55:51,542 --> 00:55:53,208
I'm sorry.

1000
00:56:55,167 --> 00:56:57,958
Hey. Call me right away.
Thanks. Love you. Bye.

1001
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,373
Hey.
- Hi. What's up?

1002
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:08,873
- Nothing. I-I did it.
- What did you do?

1003
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:10,290
I told them.
I told them everything.

1004
00:57:10,292 --> 00:57:12,123
I-I went crazy.
I kind of lost my mind.

1005
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:13,915
I said I'm miserable.
I said, "I hate this."

1006
00:57:13,917 --> 00:57:15,915
I said... I said
"fuck you" to my mom.

1007
00:57:15,917 --> 00:57:17,706
You said "fuck you" to your mom?

1008
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:20,540
Yes. It was pretty amazing.
I wish you could have seen it.

1009
00:57:20,542 --> 00:57:22,331
What did she say?

1010
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:24,081
Uh, I don't know.

1011
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:25,665
I don't know. What difference
does it make? Who cares?

1012
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:27,290
Do you know what this means?
I'm like a new man.

1013
00:57:27,292 --> 00:57:29,290
I'm gonna come home, I'm gonna
need to shave more.

1014
00:57:29,292 --> 00:57:31,290
I might start hitting you.
I'm the man now.

1015
00:57:31,292 --> 00:57:33,873
I'm the man of the family...
Of our family.

1016
00:57:33,875 --> 00:57:36,373
Okay. Good. I love you.

1017
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:39,123
You fucking bet
your sweet ass you do.

1018
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:43,623
I got to go. But I love you,
and I will talk to you soon.

1019
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:45,081
Bill.

1020
00:57:45,083 --> 00:57:46,831
Hey, pal. You okay?

1021
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:48,831
Yeah, actually,
I'm pretty great.

1022
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:51,415
Look, going home sober...
Always tough.

1023
00:57:51,417 --> 00:57:53,206
The folks will push
your buttons.

1024
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:54,998
Hell, they fucking
installed them.

1025
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,998
Just remember, rule number one,

1026
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,956
"Say what you mean,
but don't say it mean."

1027
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:02,667
Right.

1028
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:07,375
- Morning.
- Hi.

1029
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:17,667
You doing okay?

1030
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:23,208
I'm good. I feel good.

1031
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:30,206
That was crazy yesterday.

1032
01:00:30,208 --> 01:00:31,956
Which part?

1033
01:00:31,958 --> 01:00:34,165
All the stuff you said.

1034
01:00:34,167 --> 01:00:37,998
It was incredibly brave.
- Oh.

1035
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,873
I've never seen anyone talk
to their mother that way.

1036
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:43,623
Well, all that stuff's
been building up

1037
01:00:43,625 --> 01:00:45,915
and it needed saying.

1038
01:00:45,917 --> 01:00:47,373
I'm sorry you had to...

1039
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:49,873
You're not scared?

1040
01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:51,373
What do you mean?

1041
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:54,998
- I don't know.
- They were pretty drunk.

1042
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,040
I don't... I doubt they
even remember it.

1043
01:00:58,042 --> 01:01:01,125
Ah, it was pretty dramatic.

1044
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,917
Good morning.

1045
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:26,831
Julie, hon.

1046
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:29,831
Come out to the patio.

1047
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,542
Go, go, go.

1048
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:42,458
So...

1049
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:47,998
You said some things last night.

1050
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,665
Now we have some things.

1051
01:01:50,667 --> 01:01:52,456
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

1052
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:56,748
You said that word to me,
your mother.

1053
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:01,250
And you accused me.
I'm a spider, you said.

1054
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:06,623
So said the spider to the fly.

1055
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:09,415
Now you listen to me.

1056
01:02:09,417 --> 01:02:12,123
You left this family

1057
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:15,040
to pursue your childish dreams
in New York.

1058
01:02:15,042 --> 01:02:19,040
You abandoned us. You left.

1059
01:02:19,042 --> 01:02:24,331
And yet we welcome you
with open arms,

1060
01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:26,623
including that woman
you bring here,

1061
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:31,248
who has never once confided
in me or shown her true colors.

1062
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,956
And yet we bring
you here with love.

1063
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:35,915
And we are patient because
we know, like every chick,

1064
01:02:35,917 --> 01:02:37,790
you will come home to roost.

1065
01:02:37,792 --> 01:02:41,081
We know that when your foolish
dreams leave you dry,

1066
01:02:41,083 --> 01:02:43,458
it's your family you will need.

1067
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:49,456
And you have the audacity to say
that we force you to be here,

1068
01:02:49,458 --> 01:02:54,331
that I spin my web
and I hold you a prisoner?

1069
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:56,415
Well, let me tell you something.

1070
01:02:56,417 --> 01:02:58,165
By the grace of Heaven,
you're in this family.

1071
01:02:58,167 --> 01:03:01,373
And by my wrath, you'll be out.

1072
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,790
You blame your father
for your problems.

1073
01:03:03,792 --> 01:03:07,873
You say he didn't hug you,
like you were a girl,

1074
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:09,665
and it's his fault now
that you have to do

1075
01:03:09,667 --> 01:03:12,831
everything in fours
or whatever the doctor said.

1076
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:14,665
What doctor?

1077
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:16,498
- Let her speak! Let her speak!
- Let her talk. Shame on you.

1078
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,873
You stick to your druthers,
Jeffrey.

1079
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:21,831
You should be grateful
to have this family.

1080
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:23,581
Some people don't have a family.

1081
01:03:23,583 --> 01:03:26,581
You're sitting right next
to someone whose husband died.

1082
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:28,748
How dare you?

1083
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:30,456
Shame on you, Jeffrey.

1084
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:32,373
Shame!

1085
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:37,040
Tricia, shut your goddamn mouth
and get that child out of here.

1086
01:03:37,042 --> 01:03:39,081
You know what you did
last night?

1087
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:42,540
You broke your father's heart.

1088
01:03:42,542 --> 01:03:45,248
And shame on you.

1089
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:47,665
Shame on you, dear God.
- Mom, I...

1090
01:03:47,667 --> 01:03:49,831
Don't you dare offer
an apology now.

1091
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:52,790
It will not be accepted.
You're on notice.

1092
01:03:52,792 --> 01:03:56,623
Nobody needs you here, Jeffrey.
It is you who needs us.

1093
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:59,248
May it always be.

1094
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:01,540
We keep the peace.

1095
01:04:01,542 --> 01:04:04,456
It's 4th of July weekend.

1096
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:07,290
Celebrate our nation.

1097
01:04:07,292 --> 01:04:09,458
But you get your ducks in a row.

1098
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:14,456
Ready for a drink yet?

1099
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:20,665
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

1100
01:04:20,667 --> 01:04:22,956
I told you. I told you they
didn't forget.

1101
01:04:22,958 --> 01:04:24,831
Could've warned me.

1102
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:27,915
No, you made a good impression.

1103
01:04:27,917 --> 01:04:29,873
Morning.

1104
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:09,956
They have the cameras come in,

1105
01:06:09,958 --> 01:06:11,373
but it's worse
'cause they're handling

1106
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:13,498
scratch tickets
and money and shit.

1107
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,665
It's wrapped up in cellophane.

1108
01:06:15,667 --> 01:06:17,915
And then you're gonna buy
a fucking tuna-fish sandwich

1109
01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:19,331
from the guy?
- Me?

1110
01:06:19,333 --> 01:06:21,081
I fucking love it.
Why wouldn't I?

1111
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:23,790
I guarantee you've eaten
a booger in the last week.

1112
01:06:23,792 --> 01:06:27,998
Okay, well, then
I like boogers in my tuna.

1113
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,915
'Cause if he's available,
obviously I want him.

1114
01:06:29,917 --> 01:06:31,998
He's a better player, but...

1115
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,748
Yes. Well, either...
Either guy is fine.

1116
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:36,665
I mean, they're both great,
but obviously he's better.

1117
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:38,581
So if he's available,
I want him.

1118
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:41,831
I mean, we want to have
that full sound.

1119
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:44,415
Well, then we'll play as a
five-piece. That's fine, too.

1120
01:07:02,458 --> 01:07:04,248
Shirley.

1121
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:07,248
Shirley. Shirley.

1122
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:09,540
I'm telling you right now...

1123
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:11,040
- Shirley!
- What?

1124
01:07:11,042 --> 01:07:13,748
- I'm going to bed.
- Already?

1125
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:15,206
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

1126
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:16,540
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1127
01:08:26,292 --> 01:08:29,998
And you guys, put the dishes
away after you dry them.

1128
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,873
I don't want to wake up
tomorrow and see

1129
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:33,915
a sideboard full of dishes.

1130
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:42,540
Those girls can't finish a job.

1131
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:51,167
Hang up the pants.

1132
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:21,831
The sandwich for tomorrow
got spoiled.

1133
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:25,042
Gonna have to go into town
and get a pork or something.

1134
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:35,000
I...

1135
01:09:41,917 --> 01:09:43,750
I think, uh...

1136
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:49,625
I...

1137
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:53,875
feel ashamed.

1138
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,706
Or something.
- No, you don't.

1139
01:09:58,708 --> 01:10:02,290
Go to bed.

1140
01:10:02,292 --> 01:10:04,373
Yeah.

1141
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:06,581
I, uh...

1142
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:10,958
Yeah, I-I just, uh, feel bad.

1143
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,458
Well, he had no right
to talk to me that way.

1144
01:10:18,125 --> 01:10:20,917
No. No. Um, I, um...

1145
01:10:24,417 --> 01:10:26,083
I think...

1146
01:10:30,417 --> 01:10:32,417
I think I let him down.

1147
01:10:36,292 --> 01:10:37,875
And, uh...

1148
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:42,958
It's worse than that,
even, 'cause...

1149
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:48,083
To let someone down,
you gotta...

1150
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:53,581
uh...

1151
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:56,790
in the first place.

1152
01:10:56,792 --> 01:10:59,125
And I think I feel
ashamed of myself.

1153
01:11:02,333 --> 01:11:04,042
And I think...

1154
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:13,542
it's too late.

1155
01:11:18,167 --> 01:11:20,042
For anything.

1156
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:25,625
It's too late.

1157
01:11:30,042 --> 01:11:32,498
Where... What are you saying
this for now?

1158
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:36,625
Where's this from now?
Are you saying I did something?

1159
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:21,208
You coming down to breakfast?

1160
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:06,290
Ah, that fucking nitwit
park ranger.

1161
01:13:06,292 --> 01:13:08,290
Not the first time
we've met that guy.

1162
01:13:08,292 --> 01:13:10,040
A couple years ago.

1163
01:13:10,042 --> 01:13:12,998
I'm deaf in my left ear.
Thanks, Ton. Jesus.

1164
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,915
Excuse me.

1165
01:13:15,917 --> 01:13:17,833
Can't even hear. It's ringing.

1166
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:21,123
Fuck's the matter with you?

1167
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:24,498
It's Ma. She's dying, I think.

1168
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,831
What do you mean, she's dying?
What are you talking about?

1169
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:29,456
- She's dying.
- She's not dying.

1170
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:32,331
She's okay. Go outside,
all right? And have a good time.

1171
01:13:32,333 --> 01:13:34,415
Okay? Come on, Darlene.

1172
01:13:34,417 --> 01:13:37,167
What are we eating? What,
am I supposed to eat my hand?

1173
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:52,581
Bro, you got to make this right.

1174
01:13:52,583 --> 01:13:54,123
What?

1175
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:57,581
I mean, you had your fun,
but that's your mom.

1176
01:13:57,583 --> 01:13:59,040
Everything's all fucked up.

1177
01:13:59,042 --> 01:14:01,623
Hey, hey, hey.
Just go say you're sorry.

1178
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:04,290
- I'm not sorry, Mark.
- Well, you got to be sorry.

1179
01:14:04,292 --> 01:14:05,915
I mean, I get you working
out your thing,

1180
01:14:05,917 --> 01:14:08,123
but blah, blah, blah.

1181
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:10,290
This is family.
You don't fuck around with that.

1182
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:13,456
I mean, you think
I don't have things?

1183
01:14:13,458 --> 01:14:15,623
You think I don't have shit
I got to get off my chest?

1184
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:19,665
Things I need to say for me?
But I don't bring that in here.

1185
01:14:19,667 --> 01:14:23,498
That's not for them.
That's my own shit.

1186
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,831
I'll take it to my grave,
most likely.

1187
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:28,415
You need to say
you're sorry, kid.

1188
01:14:28,417 --> 01:14:30,956
I mean, I know you know it.
Just... Just do it.

1189
01:14:30,958 --> 01:14:34,123
Mark, I needed to say
what I said.

1190
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:37,498
All right, maybe I could have
said it better, but...

1191
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:40,956
I want an apology from her.

1192
01:14:40,958 --> 01:14:44,331
An apology from her?
Yeah.

1193
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:46,456
What are you, Hitler?

1194
01:14:46,458 --> 01:14:50,831
Dude. You know what she's like.
You were there.

1195
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:52,165
I mean, you fucking...
You saw it.

1196
01:14:52,167 --> 01:14:54,498
Yeah. Yeah, so what?

1197
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:57,665
That's life, bro.
You don't fix that.

1198
01:14:57,667 --> 01:15:00,748
You don't make your mother
say she's sorry.

1199
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:05,331
Bro, what the fuck?

1200
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:08,790
You didn't have it that bad.
My mother died, bro.

1201
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:10,623
Yeah, I know the fucking
family history, Mark.

1202
01:15:10,625 --> 01:15:13,623
Yeah. Yeah. Good.
Think about it.

1203
01:15:13,625 --> 01:15:15,956
All right? Take a fucking look.

1204
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:17,623
Yeah. Look at her.

1205
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:20,290
She's fucking practically
catatonic in there, you know?

1206
01:15:20,292 --> 01:15:22,581
Yeah. So what? She's a cunt.

1207
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:25,331
But I was lucky to have her.
And so were you.

1208
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:26,998
Fuck off with this shit.

1209
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,581
What do you mean,
fuck off, dude?

1210
01:15:28,583 --> 01:15:30,206
You can't just talk
to somebody that way.

1211
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:32,373
It's your fucking mother, right?
- Yeah, it's my mother.

1212
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:34,623
Would you talk to someone
on the street that way?

1213
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:36,873
No. Would someone on the street
that way treat me that way?

1214
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:40,248
Yeah. And you said your piece,
and now she's a fucking wreck.

1215
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:41,998
You're not even
fucking related to her.

1216
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,081
- So what? I...
- What?

1217
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:47,123
Dude, I don't talk
to fucking anyone that way.

1218
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:48,581
You shared your feelings.

1219
01:15:48,583 --> 01:15:50,206
You're fucking
talking to me that way.

1220
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:51,915
Yeah. No. Because you
fucking said it to me.

1221
01:15:51,917 --> 01:15:53,623
What did I get
to say to you, huh?

1222
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:55,706
'Cause I was standing
in the back of the fucking room

1223
01:15:55,708 --> 01:15:58,956
'cause I fucking sang a song,
and you fucking blew up on us?

1224
01:15:58,958 --> 01:16:00,706
- Lower your voice.
- So we... Lower my voice.

1225
01:16:00,708 --> 01:16:03,956
All right. That's fucking rich
coming from you.

1226
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:06,415
Lower my voice
in the fucking house?

1227
01:16:06,417 --> 01:16:08,915
You were fucking screaming.
Screaming.

1228
01:16:08,917 --> 01:16:12,415
You know what? You didn't even
come to talk to me afterwards.

1229
01:16:12,417 --> 01:16:15,081
Right? So I'm talking to you
right fucking now.

1230
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:18,250
I was gonna let it go.
Take a fucking look, brother.

1231
01:16:24,958 --> 01:16:27,706
I mean, Jeff...

1232
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:29,375
There's no food here.

1233
01:16:33,167 --> 01:16:36,665
Folks are hungry.

1234
01:16:36,667 --> 01:16:39,790
Tony's hungry.

1235
01:16:39,792 --> 01:16:42,540
I mean, you want
to fucking hear Kevin?

1236
01:16:42,542 --> 01:16:44,248
I mean, you know how
he fucking gets.

1237
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:45,958
All right.

1238
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,456
She's having a great time.
- I know.

1239
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:55,415
'Cause she's not related.
She can just fucking leave.

1240
01:16:55,417 --> 01:16:59,123
I don't have a car.
Uh, what are we eating?

1241
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:01,081
- We'll go get pizza.
- That sounds great.

1242
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:02,623
Pizza sounds awesome.

1243
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:05,123
- Fucking jerk-off.
- It's something. It's something.

1244
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:06,956
Just make sure you get me
a fucking pepperoni,

1245
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:08,331
or I'm gonna lose my shit.

1246
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:10,206
- Naomi?
- Yeah? Is there a good place?

1247
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:12,081
No, it's a terrible place,
but come with me.

1248
01:17:12,083 --> 01:17:13,831
Smell.
- Nostalgia?

1249
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:15,665
It's my childhood.

1250
01:17:15,667 --> 01:17:17,248
You're gonna love it
when you come every year now.

1251
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:21,290
- Oh, God. Don't.
- Hello.

1252
01:17:21,292 --> 01:17:23,540
We need some pizzas
for a big family.

1253
01:17:23,542 --> 01:17:26,165
At least six?
- Mm-hmm.

1254
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:29,665
Let's do four large cheese.
Everybody loves cheese.

1255
01:17:29,667 --> 01:17:33,415
I need one large pepperoni,
one large linguiça.

1256
01:17:33,417 --> 01:17:35,165
And you want something special?

1257
01:17:35,167 --> 01:17:36,748
Garlic knots.

1258
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,123
- What? Garlic knots.
- Garlic knots.

1259
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:41,748
Garlic knots for the guest.

1260
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:44,706
All righty.

1261
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:46,748
Don't worry about contributing.
I got it.

1262
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:48,458
No, I wasn't going to.

1263
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:59,540
- Bobby?
- Hey, what's up, buddy?

1264
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:01,706
How you doing?

1265
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:03,498
Do you know that guy?

1266
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:07,373
Um, yeah, I do.

1267
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:08,917
He's not ev... Yeah.

1268
01:18:12,375 --> 01:18:14,540
Hey. What do you know, right?

1269
01:18:14,542 --> 01:18:17,081
Weird. Good to see you.

1270
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:18,456
I'm Bobby, by the way.

1271
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:20,206
I'm his sponsor.
He's my sponsor.

1272
01:18:20,208 --> 01:18:21,998
We're in Alcoholics Anonymous
together.

1273
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,415
We don't... You know,
we don't drink, right?

1274
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:26,706
We, uh...

1275
01:18:26,708 --> 01:18:29,831
Bob.

1276
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:31,498
- What?
- What are you doing here?

1277
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,581
All right, fine, Jeff.

1278
01:18:33,583 --> 01:18:35,915
I called your wife, and I asked
her what town you were in,

1279
01:18:35,917 --> 01:18:37,665
and I was hoping
I'd bump into you.

1280
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:41,290
Okay, you haven't called me.
You're not answering your phone.

1281
01:18:41,292 --> 01:18:42,748
- I'm sorry.
- I mean, I'm on the ropes

1282
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:46,748
with this sobriety stuff,
brother. I need you.

1283
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:49,081
I'm sorry. I have not...

1284
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:53,165
I haven't been fair to you,
and I'm sorry. I really am.

1285
01:18:53,167 --> 01:18:55,415
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

1286
01:18:55,417 --> 01:18:57,165
I mean, I'm your sponsor,
and I just...

1287
01:18:57,167 --> 01:18:58,915
I've left you hanging.
- No.

1288
01:18:58,917 --> 01:19:02,123
No, dude, it's...
It's okay.

1289
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:04,956
No one's ever apologized
to me before.

1290
01:19:04,958 --> 01:19:06,748
Ever.

1291
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:09,915
It's just, I'm dealing with
this family shit.

1292
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:11,498
Are you all right?

1293
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:17,248
I mean, no, I'm not.
I-I'm going crazy.

1294
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:21,498
I want a fucking drink so bad.
Just out of boredom.

1295
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,498
I mean, I got nothing to do.
I got no friends.

1296
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:29,208
They all drink.
I'm a fucking loser.

1297
01:19:31,417 --> 01:19:33,665
Do you know how good a drink
would taste right now?

1298
01:19:33,667 --> 01:19:37,248
Just one drink,
and it would all disappear.

1299
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:41,206
But it wouldn't.
And you haven't drank, right?

1300
01:19:41,208 --> 01:19:44,290
No. no, 33 days.

1301
01:19:44,292 --> 01:19:45,790
Look at that.

1302
01:19:45,792 --> 01:19:47,790
I mean, you're up against
some serious obstacles

1303
01:19:47,792 --> 01:19:49,956
and you haven't drank.

1304
01:19:49,958 --> 01:19:52,498
I'm up here with my family
right now, and they all drink.

1305
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,373
They try to get me to drink,

1306
01:19:54,375 --> 01:19:57,165
and it sucks, but I know
how to deal with that now.

1307
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:59,498
But it took me two years
to get to that place.

1308
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,206
And you got some friends
you'll be able to go back to.

1309
01:20:01,208 --> 01:20:03,748
And some you won't,
but fuck them.

1310
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:06,831
It gives you something
to work for.

1311
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:08,915
Yeah.

1312
01:20:08,917 --> 01:20:10,998
But it fucking
sucks though, right?

1313
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,706
I don't know. Does it?

1314
01:20:12,708 --> 01:20:14,498
Would you like it
to be like it was before?

1315
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:17,790
No, no, I don't want
to go back to that, ever.

1316
01:20:17,792 --> 01:20:20,206
Look, here's the thing.

1317
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:22,206
You can't think
about the first drink.

1318
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:23,623
Think about the last drunk.

1319
01:20:23,625 --> 01:20:26,540
What was it like
the last time you drank?

1320
01:20:26,542 --> 01:20:28,665
I can't say that
in front of a lady.

1321
01:20:30,042 --> 01:20:32,331
I mean, you want to go
back to that?

1322
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:33,998
Having nights that you
can't even talk about

1323
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,498
in front of a nice woman?

1324
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,123
I get it. Okay. I, uh...

1325
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:39,540
Point made.

1326
01:20:39,542 --> 01:20:42,206
Oh, my God, dude.
So, what's this...

1327
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:43,623
What's the family stuff
you're going through?

1328
01:20:43,625 --> 01:20:45,623
What's... What's happening?

1329
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:48,206
It's just...

1330
01:20:48,208 --> 01:20:49,748
It's my own shit.

1331
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,081
Stuff I'm trying to work out.

1332
01:20:51,083 --> 01:20:52,456
Beth and I are trying
to have a kid,

1333
01:20:52,458 --> 01:20:54,665
but I got shit
I got to deal with first.

1334
01:20:54,667 --> 01:20:57,331
What shit? You don't have a kid?
Fuck your wife.

1335
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:59,123
That's it.

1336
01:20:59,125 --> 01:21:01,581
No, I know. I just...

1337
01:21:01,583 --> 01:21:04,706
I don't think I'm cut out
to be a dad.

1338
01:21:06,583 --> 01:21:09,040
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1339
01:21:09,042 --> 01:21:11,706
I was just thinking that.

1340
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:16,956
Are you crazy? Look at me.
You would be a great dad.

1341
01:21:16,958 --> 01:21:18,540
Absolutely.

1342
01:21:18,542 --> 01:21:22,540
I can see you with a kid.
You are a dad.

1343
01:21:22,542 --> 01:21:25,415
No-brainer. You're a dad, man.

1344
01:21:39,917 --> 01:21:42,040
These fucking people.

1345
01:21:42,042 --> 01:21:45,373
- That's your family?
- Yep.

1346
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:47,040
They look cool.

1347
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,290
Amazing.

1348
01:21:56,708 --> 01:21:59,873
They're about to come in
like animals, so...

1349
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:01,331
What's up, guys?
- They got pizza.

1350
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:03,040
Come on, we got a bunch of pies.

1351
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:09,123
No pineapple.

1352
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:10,956
What do you mean, no pineapple?
It's real tasty.

1353
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:12,790
Do you put tomato sauce
on your blueberries?

1354
01:22:12,792 --> 01:22:14,623
You need to broaden
your horizons.

1355
01:22:14,625 --> 01:22:17,956
Everybody, everybody.
This is Bobby. He's my friend.

1356
01:22:17,958 --> 01:22:19,623
Hello, Bobby.
Beer's in the fridge.

1357
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:21,123
No, thanks.

1358
01:22:21,125 --> 01:22:22,956

01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:39,625
Pizza for the 4th of July?

1366
01:22:41,833 --> 01:22:45,123
Yeah, I just...
I thought it was easy.

1367
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:46,833
Save you some trouble.

1368
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,581
Pepperoni for your father?

1369
01:22:52,583 --> 01:22:55,831
Yeah, of course.

1370
01:22:55,833 --> 01:22:57,500
One linguiça.

1371
01:23:02,375 --> 01:23:05,790
Okay. I'll serve it.
Girls, bring it out.

1372
01:23:05,792 --> 01:23:07,417
Thank Christ!

1373
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:30,040
Hey, Dad.

1374
01:23:30,042 --> 01:23:34,417
- You get pepperoni?
- Yeah, of course.

1375
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:41,873
I...

1376
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:44,748
Oh.

1377
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:46,790
Oh, you better...

1378
01:23:46,792 --> 01:23:49,373
You better take that call.

1379
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:51,165
Um...

1380
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:54,290
No, no. Y-You take it.
It's your wife.

1381
01:23:54,292 --> 01:23:57,290
Okay.

1382
01:23:57,292 --> 01:23:58,958
Hey.

1383
01:24:01,208 --> 01:24:02,875
Hey, Dad.

1384
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:09,667
Thank you.

1385
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:21,540
I have so much to tell you.

1386
01:24:21,542 --> 01:24:25,165
Jeff, I went to the doctor
yesterday.

1387
01:24:25,167 --> 01:24:27,748
I figured since you were talking
about this, seriously,

1388
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:30,915
I should get myself checked out.

1389
01:24:30,917 --> 01:24:34,873
And he basically said, "No way."

1390
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:36,790
No way?

1391
01:24:36,792 --> 01:24:38,498
Yeah, it's too late.

1392
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,915
My tubes or whatever.

1393
01:24:40,917 --> 01:24:45,373
Basically said it's just
never gonna happen.

1394
01:24:45,375 --> 01:24:48,748
Wait. Just no? I mean...

1395
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,415
When does a doctor say just no?

1396
01:24:50,417 --> 01:24:51,706
I mean, there must be something.

1397
01:24:51,708 --> 01:24:53,290
I mean, yeah, we could...

1398
01:24:53,292 --> 01:24:55,873
We could have done in vitro
or some other stuff.

1399
01:24:55,875 --> 01:24:59,415
I don't know, Jeff.
Maybe it is too late.

1400
01:24:59,417 --> 01:25:02,873
Maybe it's better this way.

1401
01:25:02,875 --> 01:25:06,623
I don't know
if I'm cut out for this.

1402
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:09,498
Okay. All right.
Maybe you're right.

1403
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:14,290
Maybe it's too late,
but maybe it's not.

1404
01:25:14,292 --> 01:25:17,623
How about...

1405
01:25:17,625 --> 01:25:20,623
when I get home,
we'll talk about it?

1406
01:25:20,625 --> 01:25:22,123
Okay.

1407
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:24,123
I'm sorry.

1408
01:25:24,125 --> 01:25:25,998
Sorry?

1409
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,958
You don't have to be sorry.
I'm sorry.

1410
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:42,831
Are you okay?

1411
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:44,456
Never mind me. I'm fine.

1412
01:25:44,458 --> 01:25:48,748
I mean, look, we don't know
what's gonna happen,

1413
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:52,248
but I feel like
I know one thing.

1414
01:25:55,542 --> 01:25:58,165
What's that?

1415
01:25:58,167 --> 01:26:01,040
It's gonna be okay.

1416
01:26:01,042 --> 01:26:04,498
And if it isn't okay,
that'll be okay.

1417
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:07,206
I love you.

1418
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:09,373
I love you, too.

1419
01:26:09,375 --> 01:26:10,750
Good.

1420
01:26:14,458 --> 01:26:18,540
We're gonna be fine
either way, right?

1421
01:26:18,542 --> 01:26:20,706
Yeah.

1422
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:22,748
I promise.

1423
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:25,456
I'll see you tomorrow?

1424
01:26:25,458 --> 01:26:29,290
Yeah. You will.

1425
01:26:29,292 --> 01:26:31,081
I love you.

1426
01:26:58,292 --> 01:27:01,665
Is that considered
sausage, you mean?

1427
01:27:01,667 --> 01:27:03,998
Looks like a belly-button innie.

1428
01:27:09,708 --> 01:27:11,790
You shouldn't hug
your mother like that.

1429
01:27:11,792 --> 01:27:13,915
I can't condone it.

1430
01:27:13,917 --> 01:27:16,081
Hey, Kevy.

1431
01:27:16,083 --> 01:27:18,583
