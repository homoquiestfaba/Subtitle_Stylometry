1
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:09,693
Oh, I bet you that's Trudy right now.

2
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:11,961
Harve, would you get that?

3
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,007
Harve, get that,
will you?

4
00:01:17,809 --> 00:01:19,970
<i>To the 35, 40. What a block.</i>

5
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:22,511
<i>Forty-five, still going.</i>
<i>Brought down at the 50.</i>

6
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:25,945
Okay, buster, no tapioca for you.

7
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:27,952
Hey, everybody.
- Hi.

8
00:01:28,153 --> 00:01:29,142
Hi, Trudy.

9
00:01:29,354 --> 00:01:32,187
I froze my patootie off waiting
for someone to open that door.

10
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:35,121
You know how those New Ulm men
get when the Vikings play.

11
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:39,024
Yeah, I know.
- So, Trudy, I've got cocoa, tea or cider.

12
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:40,255
Cider. Thank you.

13
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:42,592
So, what's the latest?

14
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:45,429
You girls are terrible.
You start right in on that gossip.

15
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:47,002
It's not gossip, it's news.

16
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:49,265
Yes, Blanche, it's news.

17
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:50,736
So spit it out.

18
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:53,707
The reason I was late
is because I just got off the phone...

19
00:01:53,912 --> 00:01:57,348
...with Munck headquarters in Miami.
- What did they want?

20
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:00,848
To rent a house for the new
plant manager they're sending here.

21
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:02,680
No way.
- Yes way.

22
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:05,379
We remember what happened
to that last plant manager...

23
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:07,559
...that Stu and his fellas
ran out of town.

24
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,750
The one that choked
on the knackwurst...

25
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:11,827
...during the Braunschweiger
competition?

26
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,625
Or what about the manager Stu had
stand too close to the glockenspiel?

27
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:17,802
You know I heard
he still has tinnitus?

28
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:20,972
What's that?
- Well, it's like:

29
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:34,547
All day long for the rest of your life.

30
00:02:34,753 --> 00:02:36,243
Oh, my God, that's horrible.

31
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:38,286
Don't forget
the Land O' Lakes manager...

32
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,118
...that mysteriously got locked into
the dairy cooler.

33
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:44,926
What that man had to do
in that cooler to survive...

34
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,324
It's unmentionable.

35
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:51,627
God bless our new plant manager
whoever the poor guy is.

36
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:52,826
Amen.

37
00:02:53,038 --> 00:02:54,471
Amen.

38
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:53,187
Good morning. Munck Foods.

39
00:03:58,837 --> 00:04:00,031
Sorry I'm late.

40
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:03,139
We haven't gotten far.
- We had to wait for you.

41
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,578
We were discussing
how getting the New Ulm facility...

42
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:11,146
...dumped on our division
is going to affect our bottom line.

43
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,818
Well, wouldn't it just be better
to close the plant?

44
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:15,680
It looks like a lost cause to me.

45
00:04:15,887 --> 00:04:19,823
Yes, but Marketing wants to cross
our branding in the youth demo...

46
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:24,587
...with the adult protein craze with
Rocket Bars, protein snacks for kids.

47
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:26,593
Now, we can use
the existing facility...

48
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:29,460
...but we'll have to automate it
to produce the new line...

49
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:33,331
...downsize production,
reduce the workforce by 50 percent.

50
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:35,904
The question is, who will oversee it?

51
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:42,108
Don't all of you volunteer at once.

52
00:04:48,086 --> 00:04:49,383
I can do it.

53
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:53,285
And, hey, Lucy's single.
She could do the conversion on-site.

54
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:56,017
That's not in the proposal.
- On-site would expedite it.

55
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:57,525
You'll go immediately.

56
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:00,596
Joan, book Lucy to Minnesota
this weekend.

57
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,133
This...? Minnesota?

58
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:04,563
Knew I could count on you.

59
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:42,804
Can I give you a hand with that?
- Oh, I've got it. Thank you.

60
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,270
All right.

61
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:30,387
How bad can it be?

62
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:43,430
Holy mother...

63
00:06:43,635 --> 00:06:46,763
<i>Traveling on Flight 116</i>
<i>to New Orleans.</i>

64
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:49,372
<i>Flight 116.</i>

65
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:33,049
I'm spending winter in a theme park.

66
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:53,466
Okay.

67
00:07:57,042 --> 00:08:00,978
Oh, my Lord,
locked the door at 5 out of habit.

68
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,244
Can we help you?

69
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,180
Yeah, I'm looking
for Blanche Gunderson.

70
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:10,183
My assistant, Cathy, called.

71
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:11,685
You must be Miss Hill.

72
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,551
I'm Blanche Gunderson.

73
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,725
You're my executive assistant?

74
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:17,986
Oh, heavens, no.

75
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:19,185
I'm just a secretary.

76
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:21,228
Did you need me to find you
one of those?

77
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:23,056
We'll see.

78
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:25,133
What you need to find
is a place to live.

79
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:28,829
Right. So this is your realtor, Trudy.

80
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,530
Trudy Van Uuden at your service.

81
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:33,074
That's with two U's.
A double U, not a W.

82
00:08:34,412 --> 00:08:36,972
I'll drive. What do you say
you follow with Ms. Hill?

83
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:38,672
Oh, good idea.

84
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:41,517
Oh, your luggage all matches.

85
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,585
That's so nice.

86
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,288
Say cheese.

87
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:54,693
Are you a scrapper?

88
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:55,923
Excuse me?

89
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:57,499
Oh, there's Merle. Hey, Merle.

90
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:01,030
That's our mailman, Merle.

91
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:03,070
That's what we call him.
Mailman Merle.

92
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:06,732
Because he delivers the mail,
and he's our mailman.

93
00:09:06,945 --> 00:09:09,743
So, you know?

94
00:09:11,349 --> 00:09:13,010
Oh, yeah,
do you keep a scrapbook?

95
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:14,676
Because I do.

96
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:16,012
I'm a scrapper, see.

97
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:18,121
We even got a club.

98
00:09:18,323 --> 00:09:20,348
I got a mini in my bag here.

99
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:25,687
Okay, so this here is our dog,
Winston Churchill.

100
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:28,331
He's dead.
He was a bit of drooler, I'm afraid.

101
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:31,599
And this here is my kitty, Snowflake.

102
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:33,031
She's dead too.

103
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:36,969
We had to put her down
on account of that kitty-leukemia thing.

104
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:40,975
You should've seen the kinds of things
she was barfing up on our couch.

105
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:42,976
Poor thing. Bless her heart.

106
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:46,677
She's not dead in the picture though.
She's just sleeping.

107
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:51,117
Could I look at that later maybe?

108
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:52,619
Okay?

109
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,887
So...

110
00:09:57,495 --> 00:09:59,395
Are you married?
Do you have children?

111
00:09:59,597 --> 00:10:01,155
No, no. I'm not married.

112
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:03,630
Oh, you're still young, you know?

113
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:04,859
Relatively.

114
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:10,267
I mean, you still got time, I suppose.

115
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:14,605
Do you eat meat, or are you one
of those vegetarian people?

116
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:17,441
No. I'm not a vegetarian.

117
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:20,777
Why?
- Because it's your first night in town.

118
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:23,385
Don't think we're gonna let you
go hungry.

119
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:26,955
You're coming to my house for dinner.
Nothing fancy, of course.

120
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:29,092
Meatloaf.

121
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:36,127
Do you mind
if I ask you a personal question?

122
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:41,161
Isn't that what you've been doing?

123
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:44,465
Have you found Jesus?

124
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:50,610
Well, I didn't know he was missing.

125
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:04,223
It was just a joke.

126
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,463
Normally we don't joke
about Jesus around here.

127
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:14,569
But I can see how you'd think
that was sort of funny.

128
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:17,469
Imagine Jesus gone missing.

129
00:11:18,576 --> 00:11:20,168
Imagine.

130
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:41,364
It's clearing. Chill coming on.

131
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:43,500
It's gonna get a heck of a lot colder.

132
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:46,465
This place is big, but what the hey.

133
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:49,702
Colder?

134
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:54,010
It gets colder?

135
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:55,201
Oh, yeah.

136
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:00,850
Oh, good. Electric is still on.

137
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:03,145
Heat's LP. Tank's out back.
Furnace is a Norge.

138
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:05,481
The pipes are wrapped.
Windows are two-paned.

139
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,817
And there's a double layer
of Owens Corning.

140
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:11,427
Hardwood. You got rugs to keep from
freezing the bejesus out of your toes.

141
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:13,290
Wait, you just lost me.

142
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:14,965
No problem. What didn't you get?

143
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,896
Well, I understood
that the electric is still on.

144
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:25,569
Does that work?
- Oh, sure as shooting.

145
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:27,574
Okay. Then I'll take it.

146
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,269
Want me to go over the fireplace?

147
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,881
No, I'm a city girl,
but I know how to light a fire.

148
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:34,845
Where's the switch?

149
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:45,423
She seems nice enough.

150
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,599
I doubt she'll last a week.
Poor thing.

151
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,443
There you are.
I was starting to wonder.

152
00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:03,113
I got lost.

153
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:05,578
You said it was around
the other side of the lake.

154
00:13:05,783 --> 00:13:07,774
Every direction I went,
there was a lake.

155
00:13:07,986 --> 00:13:10,113
That's not even a lake.
That's Luden Pond.

156
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:12,050
I turned around.
I found another lake.

157
00:13:12,257 --> 00:13:15,226
Oh, I bet you went
to Van Meyer Slough.

158
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:17,951
And then I went left.
- That's actually a stone quarry.

159
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:20,027
But you made it.

160
00:13:20,398 --> 00:13:21,865
Yeah.

161
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:28,097
Oh, Harve, company.

162
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:31,139
I didn't know whether
to get red or white.

163
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:35,606
But all they had
was Zinfandel anyway, so...

164
00:13:35,813 --> 00:13:40,910
Oh, hell, anything you can uncork,
uncap or unscrew, I'll drink it.

165
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:45,912
This is my husband, Harve.
You'd think he's joking, but he's not.

166
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:48,592
Take your coat?
- Yes. Please.

167
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:50,488
That would be great.

168
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:53,162
Thank you.

169
00:13:58,069 --> 00:14:00,833
You okay like that?
You're not too cold?

170
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,063
No. I'm fine.

171
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:05,876
Oh, okay,
because you look a little cold.

172
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:07,942
I'm fine.

173
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:19,384
Anyhow, there's someone
that I want you to meet.

174
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,023
I'm hoping that you hit it off.

175
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:25,924
If you do, it's gonna make your stay
here in Minnesota a lot more pleasant.

176
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:31,297
So, Lucy Hill, this is Ted Mitchell.

177
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:34,437
Damn.

178
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:35,797
Damn.

179
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:38,999
Oh, so it's a whole dinner party.
- Oh, yeah.

180
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,438
Lovely. Thank you.

181
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:42,272
How you doing?

182
00:14:42,814 --> 00:14:46,215
You've got beer dripping
from your chin.

183
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:49,118
Awesome.
- Can I use your powder room?

184
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,380
You betcha. It's right through
the kitchen to the right.

185
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:15,709
Yeah?
- Lucy, we thought we'd open...

186
00:15:15,913 --> 00:15:18,177
...that wine with dinner.
Would you like a glass?

187
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:19,543
Yeah, that would be great.

188
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:22,777
You know,
I actually am feeling a little chilly.

189
00:15:22,987 --> 00:15:24,545
Would you mind
bringing my jacket?

190
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:26,348
Oh, you betcha.

191
00:15:28,126 --> 00:15:29,320
God.

192
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:39,732
Blanche, this meatloaf is good.
- Oh, thank you, Ted.

193
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:52,547
So, Ted, do you live around here?

194
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:56,552
Yeah.

195
00:15:56,888 --> 00:15:58,412
Yeah, I moved up here.

196
00:15:58,623 --> 00:15:59,920
Little over 10 years ago.

197
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:01,682
Why?

198
00:16:03,027 --> 00:16:05,518
I mean, not that it's not nice.
I'm sure.

199
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,924
But why?

200
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,800
Why not, you know?

201
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:15,138
What's so great about a city?

202
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:20,171
Well, I mean,
the cultural advantages alone.

203
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:24,644
Museums, opera, ballet, theater.
Not to mention nightlife.

204
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:26,578
Oh, yeah.

205
00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:29,981
Do you know I was in a restaurant,
and Justin Timberlake walked in?

206
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:33,646
For real?
- Is he one of your MP3 fellas?

207
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:36,250
Oh, that's nice.

208
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:38,622
I thought all they had
was skinny supermodels...

209
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,127
...and Colombian drug lords.

210
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:43,389
Ted, that's terrible.

211
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:46,801
You know who else was there,
Bobbie?

212
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:48,796
Fergie.

213
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:50,598
I bet you like her music, huh?

214
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:53,003
My dad won't let me like that stuff.

215
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:56,912
Well, you seem old enough
to decide for yourself what you like.

216
00:16:57,115 --> 00:16:58,742
Excuse me?

217
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:02,778
Women like that just selling
themselves as sex objects?

218
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:06,252
What kind of a role model is that
for young girls?

219
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:11,589
I think that any examples of strong
successful young women are vital.

220
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:15,857
And that's how you measure success?
By how provocative a woman can be?

221
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:18,035
We'll pass on that.
We'll listen to country.

222
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:20,864
Oh, the twangy drivel
about the losers who drink beer...

223
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:22,869
...and drive pickup trucks?

224
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:24,541
Yeah.

225
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,038
How about polka?
It's got something for everybody.

226
00:17:29,247 --> 00:17:31,442
That's it, Harve,
you're exactly right. Bingo.

227
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:34,278
I like beer.

228
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,512
I drive a pickup.

229
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:41,787
I should have known.

230
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:51,358
You probably drive a new car
for what it says about you...

231
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:53,059
...when what it says about you...

232
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:56,638
...is how you bow down to the big
corporations that made a gravy train.

233
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:59,241
And would anybody like
more gravy?

234
00:17:59,443 --> 00:18:00,432
Trudy? Kimberley?

235
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:04,240
Industrial competition in a free-market
economy is what built this country.

236
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:08,043
No, robber barons built it, and they
did it from the blood of working folks.

237
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:10,743
If you steal somebody's car,
you get thrown in jail.

238
00:18:10,955 --> 00:18:13,355
If you steal life savings,
you get to be a CEO.

239
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:15,082
I'm planning on being a CEO.

240
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:17,887
You better count the silverware
before she leaves.

241
00:18:18,095 --> 00:18:20,188
I'm leaving now.
- Not if I leave first.

242
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:22,992
Come on, baby.
- I've got Snickerdoodles with tapioca.

243
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:25,032
Thanks for dinner.
- Thanks for dinner.

244
00:18:29,006 --> 00:18:31,270
Totally awesome.

245
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:04,194
Miss Hill.

246
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,363
Stu Kopenhafer, plant foreman.

247
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:09,198
I'm supposed to show you around.

248
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:20,877
Milk processors, cooking facilities.

249
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:23,553
Curdling vats, slop sinks...

250
00:20:23,754 --> 00:20:26,484
...auxiliary refrigeration,
more slop sinks.

251
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:28,390
Storage racks over there.

252
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:32,689
Conveyor belt.
This is your main production floor.

253
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:36,227
I'd really like to speak
with the workers.

254
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:38,561
Where can I do that?

255
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:44,501
Bob.

256
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:54,211
What are you waiting for?

257
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:58,388
Greetings, New Ulm.

258
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:02,525
I'm here to usher in a new phase.

259
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:04,319
This is a great opportunity.

260
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:08,589
I'm here to reconfigure
for the initialization of Rocket Bars.

261
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:19,742
This will be an exciting utilization
of new branding...

262
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:23,243
...for capitalizing
on a highly profitable demographic.

263
00:21:23,447 --> 00:21:24,505
Cut to the chase.

264
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:28,173
We don't give a fart on a muggy day
what you're making us make.

265
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:30,547
Tell us how many you're planning
on laying off.

266
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:33,383
Management at Munck Foods
in Miami has sent me here...

267
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:36,185
...to conduct mechanization
and modernization procedures.

268
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:39,056
Yeah, you Munck-ees all say
that crap.

269
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:41,959
But every time one of you comes,
we end up losing jobs.

270
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,225
Well, I'm interested
in the jobs we'll create.

271
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:47,962
If you're not, that's fine, but I'll expect
you to implement the changes...

272
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:49,935
...in a timely manner.

273
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:51,438
Okay?

274
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:54,975
Oh, yeah, well, nice try, Trudy.

275
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:57,204
No, you're not getting
that recipe out of me.

276
00:21:57,415 --> 00:21:58,404
Because l...

277
00:21:58,616 --> 00:22:00,447
All right, listen, gotta go.
Okay, yeah.

278
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:01,777
Let me jump.

279
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:04,045
Yeah, okay, I know.
I'll give it to you later.

280
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:06,450
Okay, bye-bye then. Yeah, bye.

281
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:08,215
Oh, good morning.
Sorry about that.

282
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:12,226
That was Trudy. She's always trying
to get my tapioca recipe out of me.

283
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:16,423
Yeah, well, I doubt that your tapioca
recipe is gonna affect the plant.

284
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:18,465
So let's just stick to work
if we could.

285
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:20,796
Oh, okay.
Oh, listen, sorry about being late.

286
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:22,666
Billy had a run-in up at the school.

287
00:22:22,873 --> 00:22:25,273
Had to go talk to the principal,
don't you know?

288
00:22:25,476 --> 00:22:29,071
He thinks he's a little Puff Diddly,
in case you didn't notice last night.

289
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:33,145
Is that my office?
- Oh, yeah.

290
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,147
I'd like to see you in there, please.

291
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:40,286
As a female, do you know
how I'm on the fast track to VP...

292
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:42,652
...in a Fortune 500 company?
- No, I don't.

293
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,796
When it's time to work,
I concentrate on work.

294
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:49,994
I get you.
- And I expect one's personal life...

295
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:51,532
...to be kept personal.

296
00:22:51,735 --> 00:22:54,135
Okay, that's easy.
- But not you, apparently.

297
00:22:54,338 --> 00:22:56,772
You're trying to set me up
after having just met me.

298
00:22:58,242 --> 00:23:01,336
Well, actually...
- I don't want excuses.

299
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:02,739
I am here to do a job.

300
00:23:02,947 --> 00:23:05,711
I will not get personally attached
to this town or anybody.

301
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:08,214
Okay, but listen...
- No buts.

302
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:11,819
But for the sake of argument,
let's say I did want to get set up.

303
00:23:12,022 --> 00:23:15,981
Trying to hook me up with that guy?
I may be in the middle of nowhere.

304
00:23:16,193 --> 00:23:19,890
But I am not so desperate that I would
consider your sorry-ass truck guy.

305
00:23:20,097 --> 00:23:21,655
Right. Sorry-ass truck guy.
- Good.

306
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:26,166
Now that that's clear,
let's just brush that off.

307
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:31,034
So I can spend the rest of the morning
kissing the ass of the local union rep.

308
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:33,642
Who I actually think is here.

309
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:46,089
Why is he out there?

310
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:49,321
Funny story.

311
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:53,693
It might have been presumptuous
of me to try to set you up...

312
00:23:53,898 --> 00:23:56,059
...but I thought it might help
professionally...

313
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:58,064
...if you were to meet
the union rep...

314
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:00,669
...for all of southeastern Minnesota
casually...

315
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:02,862
...over a nice home-cooked dinner.

316
00:24:03,474 --> 00:24:06,204
Ted is the local union rep?

317
00:24:07,011 --> 00:24:08,535
That's right.

318
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:11,214
The guy that I yelled at
over your meatloaf?

319
00:24:11,415 --> 00:24:13,178
And in the driveway some too.

320
00:24:22,993 --> 00:24:24,426
Mr. Mitchell.

321
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:26,391
Ted, wasn't it?

322
00:24:26,597 --> 00:24:30,089
Yeah. But some people refer to me
as "sorry-ass truck guy."

323
00:24:31,068 --> 00:24:32,399
I beg your pardon?

324
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:36,337
Union's been pushing
for better soundproofing in this plant.

325
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,703
But I think they should probably
extend it to the office walls too.

326
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,899
Shall we?

327
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:48,115
Well, going over union regulations
for two hours is not helping.

328
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,050
What I'm trying to do is make sure that
during this simple reconfiguration...

329
00:24:52,256 --> 00:24:55,350
...as you call it,
that not one union job gets cut.

330
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,254
I'm sure we can come
to an agreement.

331
00:24:57,461 --> 00:25:00,953
I'm gonna make sure that you comply
with that agreement every step.

332
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:02,154
Goodbye.

333
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:03,833
How is the first day going?

334
00:25:04,034 --> 00:25:05,558
It's been a very productive day.

335
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:08,067
I've spoken to the employees
and the plant foreman.

336
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:10,934
And they are very engaged
in the process.

337
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:13,371
I've laid out my work strategy
with my assistant.

338
00:25:13,577 --> 00:25:16,375
And I've begun dialoguing
with the local union rep.

339
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,674
I'm sure I'll be able to forge
a working relationship there.

340
00:25:19,883 --> 00:25:22,374
All right, but if we're gonna downsize
by 50 percent...

341
00:25:22,586 --> 00:25:25,077
...I need you to prioritize
your termination list.

342
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:27,951
Hi there. I wanted to let you know
I've rearranged my desk.

343
00:25:28,158 --> 00:25:30,490
It looks so nice
and professional now.

344
00:25:30,694 --> 00:25:33,788
So if you need anything, a drink,
or a snack, or you get homesick...

345
00:25:33,998 --> 00:25:35,966
...you wanna talk,
you just give me a shout.

346
00:25:39,303 --> 00:25:41,999
I'm so sorry.

347
00:25:45,876 --> 00:25:48,970
Oh, I'm already on that.

348
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:11,896
All I'm asking
is that we move these machines...

349
00:26:12,102 --> 00:26:14,696
...to make room
for the new production equipment.

350
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:15,894
Yeah, no.

351
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:19,200
That's not the way we do things.
- Nope, not the way we do things.

352
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,741
Not the way at all.

353
00:26:20,944 --> 00:26:23,378
You're going to have to make
some concessions.

354
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,844
Oh, we're making
some damn concessions.

355
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,677
Like Gopher Day.

356
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:29,512
Gopher Day?
- Yeah.

357
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,245
Local holiday.
First Friday of November.

358
00:26:32,456 --> 00:26:35,516
We've always gotten it off before,
but we're all working this one.

359
00:26:35,726 --> 00:26:36,715
Okay.

360
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:38,986
If I close the plant
for Gopher Day at noon...

361
00:26:39,196 --> 00:26:41,790
...then come Monday,
you'll start shifting equipment?

362
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:43,830
Sure. You betcha.
- Yeah, okay.

363
00:26:44,034 --> 00:26:45,194
Great.

364
00:27:00,684 --> 00:27:01,946
Happy Gopher Day.

365
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:29,039
Is there a problem here?

366
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:31,806
You're damn right
there's a problem.

367
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:34,279
You know, Land O' Lakes
was doing just fine...

368
00:27:34,485 --> 00:27:37,113
...before you greedy Munck-ees
captured it...

369
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:40,154
...and started killing off
my loyal hardworking customers.

370
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:44,822
Listen, Flo.

371
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:46,723
I'm here to do a job.

372
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:52,129
Just like I'd like you to do your job now
by taking my order, okay?

373
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:55,260
Great.

374
00:27:55,472 --> 00:27:59,966
Now that that's clear,
what's the special today?

375
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:05,278
We got a Go-Back-to-Miami
Where-You-Belong special.

376
00:28:07,484 --> 00:28:09,816
Oh, and Happy Gopher Day.

377
00:28:12,856 --> 00:28:16,952
How lame-ass do you have to be
to fall for something as butt-stupid...

378
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:19,994
...as thinking there's a Gopher Day?

379
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:57,497
Oh, shingles.

380
00:28:57,701 --> 00:28:59,965
Who invited the boss lady?

381
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:03,968
What do you want?

382
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:06,538
I thought I might buy you a beer.

383
00:29:08,512 --> 00:29:10,241
It's a free country.

384
00:29:10,447 --> 00:29:13,041
A proactive approach
to streamline production...

385
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,184
...creates a win-win situation.

386
00:29:16,153 --> 00:29:20,021
Of course, it requires strategization
and advanced specialization.

387
00:29:20,224 --> 00:29:21,384
Yeah.

388
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:24,985
This is really great, guys.

389
00:29:25,195 --> 00:29:27,186
I'm glad we're finally dialoguing.

390
00:29:27,397 --> 00:29:28,489
D-word, double shot.

391
00:29:33,136 --> 00:29:36,503
Are you guys really interested
in discussing mechanization?

392
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:37,765
Hell, yeah.

393
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,004
I'm really sorry, guys.

394
00:29:44,214 --> 00:29:47,274
I meant for that to be a D-word,
so you can all do a double shot.

395
00:29:47,484 --> 00:29:49,179
Way to ruin it, Maurice.

396
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:55,649
You know, I'm in charge of this plant
whether you like it or not.

397
00:29:55,993 --> 00:29:59,087
I thought this would be an opportunity
for us to bury the hatchet...

398
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:03,255
...but, instead, you just turn me
into some dumb drinking game?

399
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:06,095
Thanks a lot, asshole.

400
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:18,943
Oh, hi there.

401
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:21,913
It's official.
The lakes froze enough to drive on.

402
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,849
So Stu declared it a holiday.

403
00:30:27,257 --> 00:30:28,246
He did, did he?

404
00:30:30,093 --> 00:30:31,924
And where can I find Stu?

405
00:31:20,043 --> 00:31:21,840
Now, who invited boss lady
this time?

406
00:31:22,045 --> 00:31:24,707
You miserable son of a bitch.

407
00:31:24,915 --> 00:31:27,281
Ice Day?
What, Gopher Day wasn't enough?

408
00:31:27,484 --> 00:31:31,580
Well, you've underestimated who
you're messing with, Stu Kopenhafer.

409
00:31:31,788 --> 00:31:33,551
You're fired.

410
00:31:38,128 --> 00:31:39,493
Crap.

411
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,127
You can't fire Stu.

412
00:31:45,335 --> 00:31:47,360
I can, and I did.

413
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:48,560
Ice Day?

414
00:31:48,772 --> 00:31:50,740
Just how stupid
does everyone think I am?

415
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:52,806
What? On a scale of one to 10?

416
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,945
The first day of ice fishing
is a state holiday.

417
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,369
Fine.

418
00:31:57,581 --> 00:31:59,208
I fired him for insubordination.

419
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:01,077
Hang on a second.

420
00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:03,185
Stu...

421
00:32:03,387 --> 00:32:06,686
He takes a little while to warm up
to folks, but he's a really good man.

422
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,482
Good?

423
00:32:09,393 --> 00:32:11,588
Clearly, we define that differently.

424
00:32:11,795 --> 00:32:14,821
But I'm just trying to help you
out here, okay?

425
00:32:15,032 --> 00:32:16,863
Firing the foreman
before Thanksgiving...

426
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:18,728
...that's not gonna win you friends.

427
00:32:18,935 --> 00:32:21,369
Well, I'm here to do a job,
not make friends.

428
00:32:21,571 --> 00:32:23,334
Stu's fired.

429
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,201
Good night.

430
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:37,783
You expect me to believe
that every machine in the line...

431
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:41,014
...just broke down at the same time?

432
00:32:56,139 --> 00:32:58,539
<i>And Thanksgiving</i>
<i>is gonna be a white one.</i>

433
00:32:58,742 --> 00:33:00,334
<i>We're expecting</i>
<i>another snowstorm...</i>

434
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:02,478
<i>... blowing in</i>
<i>sometime tomorrow afternoon.</i>

435
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:07,241
It doesn't matter. I'm going to Miami.

436
00:33:46,356 --> 00:33:48,449
That's right.

437
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:21,083
Come on.

438
00:34:21,825 --> 00:34:23,850
Oh, come on.

439
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:29,694
Oh, this is not good.

440
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,589
Hey.

441
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,732
I'm in... I'm in here.

442
00:35:49,012 --> 00:35:50,741
Help.

443
00:35:51,514 --> 00:35:53,209
Help.

444
00:35:54,784 --> 00:35:57,048
Help. I'm in here.

445
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:16,836
Thanks a lot, God.

446
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,234
Come on.

447
00:36:18,441 --> 00:36:19,965
Okay.
- I got you.

448
00:36:20,443 --> 00:36:22,138
Okay. Hey...

449
00:36:22,345 --> 00:36:25,940
Watch the hands,
Mr. Touchy-Feely Hands.

450
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:27,741
Don't flatter yourself.

451
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:30,010
I'm trying to get you out of the car.
Come on.

452
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:34,179
For your information,
I do not need a man to rescue me.

453
00:36:34,391 --> 00:36:36,416
All right.
- Okay.

454
00:36:49,606 --> 00:36:51,005
Come on.

455
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:55,538
Let's get you home.

456
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:22,361
You know, you're not so bad
when you're unconscious.

457
00:37:48,131 --> 00:37:50,691
Come on.
- Oh, yup.

458
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:54,969
I got it, I got it.

459
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:57,230
I got it.
- You okay?

460
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:04,544
I got it. I got it.

461
00:38:04,748 --> 00:38:08,013
I don't need to be carried
through my door...

462
00:38:08,218 --> 00:38:11,847
...by some sexy fireman man.

463
00:38:12,055 --> 00:38:14,023
You already gave me
that lecture.

464
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:15,384
You think I'm sexy, huh?

465
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:17,457
What? Why would you think that?

466
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,423
Because you just said it.

467
00:38:19,629 --> 00:38:21,460
Out loud?

468
00:38:26,035 --> 00:38:27,024
Here, let me help you.

469
00:38:27,237 --> 00:38:28,226
I got it.
- Hold on.

470
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:30,804
I got it.
- Let me help you, let me help you.

471
00:38:33,643 --> 00:38:35,941
Don't get any ideas.

472
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:37,443
I'm not.

473
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:38,875
You okay?

474
00:38:39,082 --> 00:38:40,947
I'm fine.

475
00:38:42,018 --> 00:38:43,610
Fine.

476
00:38:51,561 --> 00:38:54,121
You okay?
- Yeah.

477
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,093
I'm fine.

478
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:05,560
This will be a good chance for you
to get out and about a little more.

479
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:07,793
Hi, girls.

480
00:40:08,638 --> 00:40:10,299
We've sold all your tapioca.

481
00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:11,974
Oh, good.

482
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:18,076
How about that rescue?

483
00:40:18,281 --> 00:40:20,112
No wonder
she's looking twitterpated.

484
00:40:20,316 --> 00:40:22,546
Oh, getting saved
by a cutie patootie like that...

485
00:40:22,752 --> 00:40:25,721
...no one could blame you
for getting a little crush, you know?

486
00:40:25,922 --> 00:40:27,116
Crush?

487
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:28,449
Ted?

488
00:40:28,658 --> 00:40:29,647
I don't think so.

489
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:32,760
Speaking of your rescue,
we made this.

490
00:40:32,962 --> 00:40:34,395
You keep that in your trunk.

491
00:40:34,597 --> 00:40:36,428
It's got our names and numbers
sewn in...

492
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:38,658
...so next time
you have emergency contacts.

493
00:40:38,868 --> 00:40:42,463
Oh, that's... That's beautiful.

494
00:40:42,672 --> 00:40:44,867
You didn't have to do that.
- Oh, we know.

495
00:40:45,074 --> 00:40:47,872
But we did it anyways,
and that's what matters the most.

496
00:40:48,077 --> 00:40:50,011
Just the thought of you
out in that storm.

497
00:40:50,213 --> 00:40:52,272
You must have been scared
out of your mind.

498
00:40:52,482 --> 00:40:54,712
Oh, I'm sure I was never
in any real danger.

499
00:40:54,918 --> 00:40:56,385
You kidding?

500
00:40:56,586 --> 00:40:59,384
Folks around these parts
freeze to death all the time.

501
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:01,113
Especially the stupid ones.

502
00:41:01,324 --> 00:41:04,623
It's nature's way
of thinning out the herd, if you ask me.

503
00:41:05,528 --> 00:41:08,019
And that Ted,
he's a handsome devil.

504
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:11,200
Now he's bending over
to lift that hose.

505
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:13,130
Oh, will you just lookie there?

506
00:41:18,608 --> 00:41:22,339
You guys cannot handle that.

507
00:41:23,212 --> 00:41:24,509
I don't know about that.

508
00:41:24,714 --> 00:41:26,545
Hey.
- Hi.

509
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:29,146
Hey, so the other night.

510
00:41:29,352 --> 00:41:31,320
I was a little drunk.

511
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:33,284
I might have said some things.

512
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:35,081
Hey, you were great out there, huh?

513
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:36,553
Here, kid, come here.

514
00:41:37,594 --> 00:41:39,084
I am so proud of you.

515
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:42,932
You remember Lucy Hill?
This is Bobbie.

516
00:41:43,366 --> 00:41:44,697
Hi.

517
00:41:44,901 --> 00:41:46,129
What's up?

518
00:41:46,803 --> 00:41:49,772
Crosscheck by the goalie. Nice.

519
00:41:59,749 --> 00:42:01,307
It's great.

520
00:42:06,856 --> 00:42:08,585
Blanche.

521
00:42:10,026 --> 00:42:12,358
Thank you for cashing in my ticket.

522
00:42:12,562 --> 00:42:14,291
Oh, no trouble at all. Oh, and listen.

523
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:16,260
Your car's all fixed up good as new.

524
00:42:17,266 --> 00:42:18,597
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

525
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:20,735
A little something for you.

526
00:42:21,504 --> 00:42:22,971
Oh, it's money.

527
00:42:26,442 --> 00:42:28,000
It's a holiday bonus.

528
00:42:28,211 --> 00:42:29,371
Don't you usually get one?

529
00:42:30,947 --> 00:42:32,778
Normally, we exchange gifts.

530
00:42:32,982 --> 00:42:34,279
But this is nice too.

531
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:37,149
Oh, and listen.

532
00:42:37,854 --> 00:42:39,685
Here's a little Merry Christmas
for you.

533
00:42:40,523 --> 00:42:42,684
Oh, Blanche, you didn't have
to get me anything.

534
00:42:42,892 --> 00:42:46,225
Oh, I didn't get it,
not like store-bought get it.

535
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:48,090
I made it.

536
00:42:48,331 --> 00:42:49,355
Here, open it.

537
00:42:54,303 --> 00:42:56,703
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

538
00:43:01,411 --> 00:43:04,574
Just in case
you wanted to start scrapping.

539
00:43:13,456 --> 00:43:15,947
"To Lucy. From Blanche."

540
00:43:21,664 --> 00:43:24,258
That was your first day here,
remember?

541
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,002
When did you take that?

542
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,371
Oh, that was a while ago.

543
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:39,673
You looked like you had the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

544
00:43:39,882 --> 00:43:41,713
So alone.

545
00:43:43,052 --> 00:43:45,714
But, you know, Lucy,
you're never really alone.

546
00:43:45,922 --> 00:43:48,652
Jesus understands
what you're going through.

547
00:43:48,858 --> 00:43:50,917
He's there for you.

548
00:43:51,961 --> 00:43:53,792
So am I.

549
00:44:00,303 --> 00:44:03,500
Hey, don't go getting all misty
on me.

550
00:44:03,706 --> 00:44:04,968
Here. I got something else.

551
00:44:05,174 --> 00:44:07,665
This ought to cheer you right up.

552
00:44:09,278 --> 00:44:10,745
Some tapioca.

553
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:14,049
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Blanche.

554
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,979
Can I have a hug?

555
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:27,020
Coming.

556
00:45:16,479 --> 00:45:18,174
Thanks.

557
00:46:07,029 --> 00:46:09,020
Ted is here for your meeting.

558
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:14,365
Hi.
- Hi.

559
00:46:15,805 --> 00:46:16,931
Thanks.

560
00:46:19,408 --> 00:46:22,468
Well, isn't this a nice way
to start out the New Year?

561
00:46:22,678 --> 00:46:25,408
"Auld Lang Syne,"
resolutions and all that.

562
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,617
If I can get you two anything,
you two just say the word.

563
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:39,719
I got the comp analysis here.

564
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:41,692
Okay.

565
00:46:45,635 --> 00:46:47,865
Before we get started.

566
00:46:48,237 --> 00:46:50,102
I never had the chance
to clear the air...

567
00:46:50,306 --> 00:46:54,072
...after you saved me
from the snow bank.

568
00:46:55,111 --> 00:46:59,878
I said a lot of rude things,
and I handled it badly.

569
00:47:00,983 --> 00:47:04,544
I think you handled it fine.
You didn't try to get out of your car.

570
00:47:04,754 --> 00:47:06,688
And that's good,
because a lot of people...

571
00:47:06,889 --> 00:47:10,381
...they try to walk for help,
and they end up dying that way.

572
00:47:10,593 --> 00:47:12,584
You were just trying to keep warm.

573
00:47:12,795 --> 00:47:16,322
Although, technically,
alcohol isn't recommended.

574
00:47:16,532 --> 00:47:20,024
And the red flag, that was...

575
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:22,337
That was brilliant.

576
00:47:24,941 --> 00:47:27,239
Now, I don't remember
anything rude.

577
00:47:29,278 --> 00:47:31,337
Well, I don't remember
saying thank you.

578
00:47:31,547 --> 00:47:33,742
And that's hardly sufficient.

579
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:34,939
So thank you.

580
00:47:36,285 --> 00:47:38,048
You're welcome.

581
00:47:39,488 --> 00:47:40,614
So comp analysis.

582
00:47:40,823 --> 00:47:43,155
Yes, comp analysis.

583
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,294
Okay, should we start
with the executive group?

584
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:00,805
Lucy.
- Returning your bowl.

585
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:02,841
Oh, what a nice surprise.
Come on in.

586
00:48:03,045 --> 00:48:05,070
Lucy's here.

587
00:48:06,182 --> 00:48:08,707
Just so you know,
I transferred it to another container.

588
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:10,681
It's not like I ate it in one sitting.

589
00:48:10,886 --> 00:48:12,877
We never do.
- Oh, stop.

590
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:15,387
Sit down. Listen, it's not fattening.

591
00:48:15,591 --> 00:48:18,151
Ever since Harve's
been on his crazy Atkins kick...

592
00:48:18,361 --> 00:48:20,886
...I had to come up
with a couple of new recipes.

593
00:48:21,097 --> 00:48:23,088
Don't even look at me,
Trudy Van Uuden.

594
00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:25,392
You're not getting my secret
out of me.

595
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:30,334
But I will tell you, my tapioca's
mainly low-fat milk and whey protein.

596
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:32,507
No way.
- Yes, whey.

597
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:35,176
Just in time.
We're exchanging Valentine's cards.

598
00:48:35,378 --> 00:48:36,936
We've got yours.

599
00:48:37,146 --> 00:48:40,741
Oh, you know, I was just gonna forget
that whole thing this year.

600
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:43,475
You know,
greeting-card-company holiday.

601
00:48:43,686 --> 00:48:45,278
Here's for you.

602
00:48:46,689 --> 00:48:49,886
Harve? Would you get that?

603
00:48:50,426 --> 00:48:52,519
Maybe that's cupid
looking for you right now.

604
00:48:54,063 --> 00:48:55,155
It's just Ted.

605
00:48:59,035 --> 00:49:01,060
I got... I got a big problem.

606
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:04,103
I need... I need a woman's help
on this one.

607
00:49:05,508 --> 00:49:07,601
It's out... Just out here.

608
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,937
Female trouble?

609
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:11,135
Sort of.

610
00:49:11,347 --> 00:49:14,646
It's the Valentine's Dance,
you know?

611
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:17,751
l... I just didn't think
it was gonna be that big of a deal.

612
00:49:17,953 --> 00:49:20,751
Oh, honey, it's her first date.
Big deal doesn't even start.

613
00:49:20,956 --> 00:49:23,447
It's not like I didn't try.

614
00:49:26,629 --> 00:49:28,620
I bought her a nice dress.
- Nice?

615
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:34,098
Pilgrims wore sexier outfits.
- She's 13, okay?

616
00:49:34,303 --> 00:49:38,262
Sexy isn't on the menu.
- Okay, is this about the dress?

617
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:41,905
No, it's a little bit worse.

618
00:49:42,478 --> 00:49:43,775
Worse than that outfit?

619
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:46,208
Bobbie, did you want to come out?

620
00:49:46,415 --> 00:49:48,645
No, I can't be seen in public.

621
00:49:48,851 --> 00:49:52,048
Ever.
- It's probably not as bad as you think.

622
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:01,562
I took her to the beauty parlor.
They gave her a perm.

623
00:50:02,898 --> 00:50:03,956
Maybe a couple of bows?

624
00:50:04,633 --> 00:50:05,793
Scarves are in these days.

625
00:50:06,001 --> 00:50:08,060
Oh, yeah, good idea, Trudy.
- Ted, I can help.

626
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:10,636
But Bobbie will have to come with me.
Is that okay?

627
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,902
Yeah.
- Bobbie, trust me.

628
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:16,169
Get in the car.

629
00:50:16,378 --> 00:50:19,108
And put your little hat back on.

630
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,558
Ladies, can we talk shoes?

631
00:50:45,207 --> 00:50:46,333
They're heels.

632
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:49,477
Little ones. That's okay, right?

633
00:50:49,678 --> 00:50:52,306
My first heels.

634
00:50:52,815 --> 00:50:55,306
But they ain't
gonna wear themselves.

635
00:50:59,555 --> 00:51:00,783
They're perfect.

636
00:51:01,957 --> 00:51:04,391
She like Cinderella and shit.

637
00:51:09,899 --> 00:51:12,959
May I present
Miss Roberta Mitchell.

638
00:51:22,678 --> 00:51:26,375
Bobbie, you... You look just like...

639
00:51:29,118 --> 00:51:30,745
You're so beautiful.

640
00:51:38,961 --> 00:51:41,896
Good evening, Mr. Mitchell.

641
00:51:42,865 --> 00:51:43,991
Hi, Waylon.

642
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,566
Wow, Bobs, you look hot.

643
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:48,532
The hell she does.
- Here.

644
00:51:48,737 --> 00:51:51,137
That's my little girl.
There's nothing hot about her.

645
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,103
Gee, thanks, Dad.

646
00:51:55,277 --> 00:51:58,303
You know, I was 14 once too.

647
00:51:58,514 --> 00:52:02,780
So I know all about what's going
through your head right now.

648
00:52:04,587 --> 00:52:05,611
And your pants.

649
00:52:05,821 --> 00:52:07,379
Daddy.

650
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,217
Come on, your mom's waiting.

651
00:52:09,425 --> 00:52:11,518
Okay.
- Hey, hey, hey.

652
00:52:12,261 --> 00:52:14,195
You're gonna have her home
by 10:30, right?

653
00:52:14,396 --> 00:52:16,455
Yeah.
- Okay, hey, hey, listen.

654
00:52:16,665 --> 00:52:19,225
I want you to remember something.

655
00:52:20,236 --> 00:52:25,139
Whatever you do to my daughter,
I do to you.

656
00:52:29,878 --> 00:52:32,938
I think what your father meant to say
is go and have a good time.

657
00:52:33,148 --> 00:52:35,878
That's not what I meant, actually.

658
00:52:36,085 --> 00:52:37,416
That's not what I said.

659
00:52:39,588 --> 00:52:41,488
That is so not what I meant at all.

660
00:52:42,558 --> 00:52:44,048
Are you okay?

661
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:47,423
Oh, I'm fine.

662
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:50,121
I'm fine. I'm just...

663
00:52:51,533 --> 00:52:53,057
I'm old.

664
00:52:53,269 --> 00:52:56,602
My daughter is starting to date,
you know? How did that happen?

665
00:52:56,805 --> 00:52:57,999
I don't feel so good.

666
00:52:58,207 --> 00:53:01,267
I'm gonna just sit down for a minute.
I can't feel my feet.

667
00:53:02,177 --> 00:53:03,735
Yeah.

668
00:53:05,314 --> 00:53:06,781
I think I'm having a stroke.

669
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:11,608
You know what?
I might be having a heart attack too.

670
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,651
Because my hands, they're numb.

671
00:53:13,856 --> 00:53:17,019
Is it your left hand or your right hand
with a heart attack?

672
00:53:17,226 --> 00:53:19,456
I can't remember which hand it is.

673
00:53:23,332 --> 00:53:25,892
So how did you know
I wasn't having a heart attack?

674
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:30,595
Because I've seen this thing before.
My father was very overprotective.

675
00:53:30,806 --> 00:53:34,264
So I guess this isn't how you planned
on spending your Saturday.

676
00:53:34,476 --> 00:53:39,379
You know, nothing about Minnesota
has fallen into what I planned.

677
00:53:39,581 --> 00:53:41,208
I hear you.

678
00:53:44,186 --> 00:53:47,622
You know,
I used to go to the factory a lot.

679
00:53:47,823 --> 00:53:51,054
Outside of Miami, with my dad.

680
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,888
He knew everything about it,
inside and out.

681
00:53:54,096 --> 00:53:56,030
Even the guys in the suits
would ask him...

682
00:53:56,231 --> 00:53:57,823
...how to get things done,
you know?

683
00:53:59,635 --> 00:54:01,899
I thought he was the boss.

684
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:05,698
I was really surprised.

685
00:54:09,878 --> 00:54:12,506
He did maintenance at the plant.

686
00:54:12,715 --> 00:54:16,583
You know, he really drilled that
into my head. That...

687
00:54:16,785 --> 00:54:18,116
You know, get an education...

688
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,448
...and it's the only thing
that people can't take away from you.

689
00:54:21,657 --> 00:54:23,750
Work hard
and do what needs to be done...

690
00:54:23,959 --> 00:54:30,057
...and maybe one day
you'll be the boss of a place like this.

691
00:54:31,967 --> 00:54:33,025
Ironic, isn't it?

692
00:54:36,071 --> 00:54:37,868
And how about you?

693
00:54:38,774 --> 00:54:41,572
How did you end up in New Ulm?

694
00:54:43,912 --> 00:54:45,379
The Mayo Clinic.

695
00:54:49,585 --> 00:54:54,079
The Mayo Clinic?
- It's just a few miles from here.

696
00:54:55,157 --> 00:55:00,185
I was born in North Carolina,
and I went to school in Auburn.

697
00:55:00,396 --> 00:55:02,830
I met my wife, Brenda, there.

698
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,366
It's funny, I say my wife.

699
00:55:07,569 --> 00:55:10,800
And even though it's been,
what, six years...

700
00:55:11,006 --> 00:55:13,736
...I still feel like she just ran out...

701
00:55:13,942 --> 00:55:16,376
...to the store to get something,
you know?

702
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:28,622
She was diagnosed
with a degenerative heart defect.

703
00:55:29,758 --> 00:55:35,287
And they had this program at the clinic
and that became our life really.

704
00:55:35,764 --> 00:55:37,629
Trips to the clinic.

705
00:55:39,067 --> 00:55:42,400
When the phone rang,
I'd just hold my breath.

706
00:55:49,778 --> 00:55:51,973
Did you ever think about
moving back South?

707
00:55:54,016 --> 00:55:57,179
This was really the only home
that Bobbie ever knew...

708
00:55:57,386 --> 00:55:59,911
...and she'd just lost her mama.

709
00:56:00,122 --> 00:56:02,181
And it didn't seem fair for her...

710
00:56:02,391 --> 00:56:05,417
...to lose her home and her friends
and her school and all that.

711
00:56:05,627 --> 00:56:06,992
So...

712
00:56:49,505 --> 00:56:51,905
What time is it?
- I don't know.

713
00:57:13,128 --> 00:57:16,620
Well, you're finally home. Because
all I've done is sit here and worry.

714
00:57:16,832 --> 00:57:18,766
It's not even 10:30.

715
00:57:18,967 --> 00:57:20,434
Lucy, you're still here?

716
00:57:21,803 --> 00:57:25,830
Well, I had to make sure he didn't get
the shotgun out if you were late.

717
00:57:28,977 --> 00:57:32,276
And now that I've seen to that...

718
00:57:32,481 --> 00:57:35,245
Did you have a good time?
Was it fun?

719
00:57:37,419 --> 00:57:38,716
It was all right.

720
00:57:39,254 --> 00:57:43,350
You know, I'm really sorry
about getting all weird on you earlier.

721
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:46,119
It's okay.
I guess Ginny Linstrom's dad...

722
00:57:46,328 --> 00:57:48,558
...gave the same creepy lecture
to Cliffie Morgan.

723
00:57:53,468 --> 00:57:56,335
Thank you for everything.

724
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:02,570
Good night.
- Good night.

725
00:58:02,778 --> 00:58:04,302
Good night.

726
00:58:35,177 --> 00:58:36,166
We're not as far...

727
00:58:36,378 --> 00:58:38,812
...on the automation and downsizing
as we had hoped.

728
00:58:39,014 --> 00:58:43,417
That's because the robotic arms
are still in some warehouse in Japan.

729
00:58:43,952 --> 00:58:46,819
If we start to downsize, we're not
gonna have the workforce...

730
00:58:47,022 --> 00:58:49,183
...for installation.
<i>- This is costing us money.</i>

731
00:58:49,391 --> 00:58:50,949
I understand.

732
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:52,990
I will keep you apprised.

733
00:58:53,195 --> 00:58:56,187
We'll talk next week then.
<i>- All right.</i>

734
00:58:56,832 --> 00:58:58,424
Goodbye.

735
00:59:01,703 --> 00:59:04,035
Lucy Hill.
<i>- Hey, Lucy, it's Ted.</i>

736
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:06,173
Listen, I have this idea for Saturday.

737
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:10,744
I was thinking I could
pick you up around 8 in the morning.

738
00:59:11,613 --> 00:59:14,013
Yeah, wear something
you can get dirty, okay?

739
00:59:14,216 --> 00:59:16,309
Something dirty?

740
00:59:20,822 --> 00:59:22,449
Hey.
- Hi.

741
00:59:23,025 --> 00:59:25,619
You...
You might wanna put these on.

742
00:59:26,395 --> 00:59:28,022
What is it?

743
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:30,798
Crow hunting.

744
00:59:32,267 --> 00:59:36,260
But I don't wanna shoot a crow.
- You don't have to shoot a crow.

745
00:59:36,471 --> 00:59:37,699
You can just shoot at them.

746
00:59:37,906 --> 00:59:42,934
It's a chance for you to get out,
you know, befriend the locals.

747
00:59:53,355 --> 00:59:57,758
Stu. What's the chance of me
running into you out here?

748
00:59:57,959 --> 00:59:59,551
Holy balls, why did you bring her?

749
00:59:59,761 --> 01:00:02,161
She said she wanted to get out,
do a little shooting.

750
01:00:02,364 --> 01:00:03,626
Shooting?

751
01:00:04,332 --> 01:00:06,095
You even got shells there, girlie?

752
01:00:06,301 --> 01:00:09,065
Yeah. Yeah, I've got shells.

753
01:00:09,271 --> 01:00:12,604
Oh, it's a great day.

754
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:18,411
Almost.

755
01:00:22,217 --> 01:00:26,051
Okay, that's it. I gotta...

756
01:00:26,421 --> 01:00:28,082
What?
- I need to...

757
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:33,284
What are you talking about?
- I need to pee.

758
01:00:38,433 --> 01:00:39,695
You're kidding me, right?

759
01:00:39,901 --> 01:00:42,768
Oh, for crying
in the beer-cheese soup.

760
01:00:42,971 --> 01:00:45,531
Are you such a city girl
you can't pee outside?

761
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:50,178
You see, Stu, that's just one
of the advantages of being a city girl.

762
01:00:50,378 --> 01:00:51,367
You don't have to.

763
01:00:52,447 --> 01:00:55,280
Don't let the badgers
bite you in the ass.

764
01:00:55,851 --> 01:00:57,751
Badgers? Really?

765
01:00:57,953 --> 01:01:00,217
Is he serious?

766
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,990
Just in case.

767
01:01:41,897 --> 01:01:43,489
Oh, come on.

768
01:01:54,576 --> 01:01:56,373
Ted!

769
01:01:59,114 --> 01:02:02,515
Okay, where is it?
Where is it, where is it, where is it?

770
01:02:02,717 --> 01:02:05,185
Where, where, where? Okay.

771
01:02:12,527 --> 01:02:13,687
What?

772
01:02:15,463 --> 01:02:17,693
You can really show a girl
a good time, you know?

773
01:02:17,899 --> 01:02:20,333
I'm trying to give you a chance
to patch things up...

774
01:02:20,535 --> 01:02:22,196
...if you would be a sport about it.

775
01:02:22,404 --> 01:02:23,894
I'm being a sport.

776
01:02:24,105 --> 01:02:26,005
But just... I'm stuck.

777
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:28,438
Then talk to him about fishing.
He loves fishing...

778
01:02:28,643 --> 01:02:30,907
No, no, no,
I'm not stuck for conversation.

779
01:02:31,112 --> 01:02:35,344
I'm stuck in your stupid overalls.
- All right, hold on.

780
01:02:42,757 --> 01:02:44,156
Turn around.

781
01:02:46,127 --> 01:02:47,754
Don't move.

782
01:02:50,465 --> 01:02:52,330
Stop moving.

783
01:02:54,469 --> 01:02:56,300
Okay, hold on, hold on.

784
01:02:57,038 --> 01:02:59,563
Hold on a second.
Hold on, hold on.

785
01:02:59,774 --> 01:03:01,241
I got it.

786
01:03:01,843 --> 01:03:03,811
Oh, that's not good.

787
01:03:11,052 --> 01:03:12,246
Turn around.
- Okay.

788
01:03:12,454 --> 01:03:13,716
No, wait...
- For real.

789
01:03:13,922 --> 01:03:16,152
What are you gonna do?
- Bend over.

790
01:03:16,358 --> 01:03:17,916
What are you gonna do?
- Bend over.

791
01:03:18,126 --> 01:03:19,286
Oh, okay, okay.

792
01:03:19,494 --> 01:03:22,930
Bend over.
- Hurry, just hurry.

793
01:03:23,899 --> 01:03:25,298
Cool.

794
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,264
You could have just cut the zipper.

795
01:03:30,338 --> 01:03:33,603
Are you wearing a thong?
- You said something dirty.

796
01:03:33,808 --> 01:03:36,675
I said what? I said wear something
you can get dirty.

797
01:03:36,878 --> 01:03:38,311
Just go.

798
01:03:38,513 --> 01:03:41,949
And don't watch. Go. Go.

799
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:43,879
Go!

800
01:04:00,302 --> 01:04:02,862
I'll be damned.
- I'm not really certain about that.

801
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,663
I did hear they knew each other...

802
01:04:04,873 --> 01:04:06,272
Sorry there, pal.

803
01:04:06,474 --> 01:04:08,271
I didn't figure her for much of a shot.

804
01:04:08,476 --> 01:04:11,639
Can you give me word
about Ted's condition?

805
01:04:11,846 --> 01:04:15,407
<i>Yes, I understand</i>
<i>it's a lower body injury.</i>

806
01:04:15,617 --> 01:04:19,144
<i>Somewhere around</i>
<i>the buttock area.</i>

807
01:04:19,354 --> 01:04:22,289
<i>Some said the shooting</i>
<i>might be a lover's vendetta...</i>

808
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:24,822
<i>... or that the woman is deranged.</i>

809
01:04:27,062 --> 01:04:30,759
Oh, that's great.
The lead story on the news is my ass.

810
01:04:35,971 --> 01:04:38,235
So you should sign off
on the spring mount there.

811
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,067
All right.

812
01:04:50,452 --> 01:04:52,010
Very good.

813
01:05:00,428 --> 01:05:02,191
Bobbie.

814
01:05:16,511 --> 01:05:17,876
How you doing?

815
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:21,344
I'm okay, how are you doing?
- Okay.

816
01:05:21,549 --> 01:05:23,483
You baked?

817
01:05:24,152 --> 01:05:26,677
Yes, I don't really bake...

818
01:05:26,888 --> 01:05:30,221
...but it seems to be the thing
that people do around here.

819
01:05:30,658 --> 01:05:34,651
I'm sorry, again.
- Oh, cake.

820
01:05:35,263 --> 01:05:37,697
Now you decide to show up?
- Hi, Bobbie.

821
01:05:40,301 --> 01:05:43,828
I think that means she forgives you.
- Okay.

822
01:05:44,539 --> 01:05:46,234
Why don't you come in?

823
01:05:48,176 --> 01:05:49,837
Mr. Arling on the line.

824
01:05:50,045 --> 01:05:52,070
Oh, good.

825
01:05:53,248 --> 01:05:55,478
Hey, did you look over the proposal?

826
01:05:55,683 --> 01:05:58,083
I know I can work
with the existing equipment.

827
01:05:59,954 --> 01:06:03,048
What do you mean, no product line?

828
01:06:03,258 --> 01:06:07,160
You can't just decide like that.
I need to be in that meeting.

829
01:06:09,264 --> 01:06:10,925
I understand.

830
01:06:11,132 --> 01:06:12,895
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

831
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:17,937
Blanche, I need to get
on the first flight to Miami.

832
01:06:21,609 --> 01:06:24,134
I'm gonna need
my alternate production figures.

833
01:06:24,345 --> 01:06:26,643
They'll be in the confidential file
in my desk.

834
01:06:26,848 --> 01:06:28,645
The key is in the center drawer.

835
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:32,308
<i>Okey-dokey artichokie.</i>
- Thank you.

836
01:07:07,789 --> 01:07:10,155
The Rocket Bars test markets
are tanking.

837
01:07:10,358 --> 01:07:11,791
We're dumping the product line.

838
01:07:13,394 --> 01:07:14,418
And the plant.

839
01:07:14,629 --> 01:07:17,792
Because it's worth more
to this company dead than alive.

840
01:07:18,366 --> 01:07:19,355
Well, I disagree.

841
01:07:19,567 --> 01:07:21,797
That would be a terrible mistake.
- Lucy.

842
01:07:22,003 --> 01:07:23,834
The people of New Ulm
are hardworking...

843
01:07:24,038 --> 01:07:27,371
...and they could create an opportunity
that we should take advantage of.

844
01:07:27,575 --> 01:07:29,338
Rocket Bars were the opportunity.

845
01:07:29,544 --> 01:07:31,603
Well, then we'll reformulate
and rename them.

846
01:07:31,813 --> 01:07:33,405
And we'll strategize with...

847
01:07:33,615 --> 01:07:36,049
The product line is dead,
and so is the plant.

848
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:38,742
We can't just write
these people's livelihoods off.

849
01:07:38,953 --> 01:07:40,352
Lucy.

850
01:07:41,422 --> 01:07:43,049
That's enough.

851
01:07:47,362 --> 01:07:49,421
We need a timetable for shutdown.

852
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,064
We'll keep a skeleton crew on...

853
01:07:51,266 --> 01:07:54,292
...until we move any remaining
physical assets off-site.

854
01:08:23,331 --> 01:08:25,026
Blanche.

855
01:08:26,968 --> 01:08:29,163
You never said anything about layoffs.

856
01:08:29,871 --> 01:08:31,600
Oh, no.

857
01:08:31,806 --> 01:08:34,036
I made that a long time ago.

858
01:08:34,242 --> 01:08:36,039
I made that list
before I even knew you.

859
01:08:36,244 --> 01:08:39,270
And that's okay? It's okay
to pull the rug out from under folks...

860
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,641
...as long as it's nobody
that you know?

861
01:08:41,849 --> 01:08:44,647
It's okay because we're just
silly Podunk Minnesotans, right?

862
01:08:44,852 --> 01:08:47,218
We talk funny and we ice-fish
and we scrapbook...

863
01:08:47,422 --> 01:08:50,653
...and we drag Jesus
into regular conversation.

864
01:08:50,858 --> 01:08:55,124
We're not cool like you, right?
So we don't matter.

865
01:08:55,964 --> 01:09:00,731
And it's okay to lie as long as you're
just pretending to be my friend.

866
01:09:00,935 --> 01:09:05,269
I didn't lie. I just didn't tell you.

867
01:09:05,473 --> 01:09:08,465
Well, I mean it is the same thing.

868
01:09:09,877 --> 01:09:11,435
I guess I lied.

869
01:09:12,213 --> 01:09:16,149
But I wasn't pretending, Blanche.
You are my friend.

870
01:09:17,885 --> 01:09:19,853
Folks need to know, you know?

871
01:09:20,054 --> 01:09:22,784
They need to be able to file protests
with the union.

872
01:09:24,092 --> 01:09:27,528
Ted.
- I had to tell him.

873
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:30,823
Maybe you can keep
that kind of thing secret, but I can't.

874
01:09:33,067 --> 01:09:34,898
Blanche, it gets so much worse.

875
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:37,230
Oh, yeah, what could be worse?

876
01:09:39,974 --> 01:09:43,910
I just found out in Miami
that they wanna close the plant.

877
01:09:47,615 --> 01:09:50,482
I know that this is gonna sound
like a hollow promise to you...

878
01:09:50,685 --> 01:09:53,381
...but I'm determined
to figure something out.

879
01:09:53,588 --> 01:09:56,557
I really am. I mean,
there has to be something, right?

880
01:09:56,758 --> 01:10:01,855
I just... You just can't eliminate
people's livelihoods, you know?

881
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:05,631
Sure you can.
It happens all the time.

882
01:10:12,206 --> 01:10:15,039
Look, this doesn't mean
that we're friends or anything...

883
01:10:15,243 --> 01:10:16,904
...but when I get upset, I cook.

884
01:10:17,111 --> 01:10:20,547
And right now, me and Harve
are up to our ears in tapioca.

885
01:10:20,748 --> 01:10:22,443
So there you go, okay?

886
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:50,668
Ted.

887
01:10:56,551 --> 01:10:58,416
Is it true?

888
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:04,886
Then we ain't got nothing to say.

889
01:11:53,474 --> 01:11:55,169
Don't leave.

890
01:11:56,144 --> 01:12:00,342
Please, I need you here.
- To type pink slips?

891
01:12:00,548 --> 01:12:03,745
Besides what's another couple
of months gonna make a difference?

892
01:12:03,951 --> 01:12:05,942
I hope so.

893
01:12:06,154 --> 01:12:09,954
Hey, let's talk tapioca.

894
01:12:10,491 --> 01:12:12,220
Okay.

895
01:12:14,595 --> 01:12:16,119
Go ahead.

896
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,151
Hi there.

897
01:12:40,354 --> 01:12:43,118
We're doing market research today
on a new product...

898
01:12:43,324 --> 01:12:48,591
...called Power Pack Protein Pudding
with Fortified Zappy-oca.

899
01:12:48,796 --> 01:12:53,130
That's your fourth sample already.
That's enough Zappy-oca for you.

900
01:12:53,334 --> 01:12:55,495
Keep them coming, Lucy.
It's like a stampede.

901
01:12:55,703 --> 01:12:59,366
Go ahead.
If you like it, just put in "I like it."

902
01:12:59,574 --> 01:13:01,872
Put a little nutmeg on top if you like.

903
01:13:02,076 --> 01:13:03,839
And if you don't like, don't do it.

904
01:13:05,613 --> 01:13:10,107
<i>Every lassie, a champion skier</i>
<i>of the first water.</i>

905
01:13:13,754 --> 01:13:17,053
<i>That's called the forward squat.</i>

906
01:13:22,363 --> 01:13:24,388
What the hell are you doing here?

907
01:13:25,132 --> 01:13:26,861
I'm here to see Stu.

908
01:13:27,068 --> 01:13:29,434
What the hell are you doing here,
Flo?

909
01:13:29,637 --> 01:13:31,537
I live here.

910
01:13:31,939 --> 01:13:35,170
Hey, Stanley.

911
01:13:35,543 --> 01:13:37,738
Annie Oakley's here.

912
01:13:39,347 --> 01:13:42,009
You and Flo.

913
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:44,414
Yeah, no...

914
01:13:44,619 --> 01:13:50,285
Yeah, she's my ex-wife
and this is my ex-house.

915
01:13:50,491 --> 01:13:54,393
And now I pay rent
to live in my ex-basement.

916
01:13:55,796 --> 01:13:58,356
Ain't that a kick in the keister?

917
01:14:00,034 --> 01:14:03,993
So let's get back to that part
about you giving me my old job back.

918
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:07,435
Corporate is shutting down
the plant.

919
01:14:09,777 --> 01:14:12,109
Goddang...

920
01:14:13,381 --> 01:14:15,144
But...
- I knew this was gonna happen.

921
01:14:15,349 --> 01:14:17,681
I have a plan.
- What is going on down there?

922
01:14:17,885 --> 01:14:21,116
None of your damn business,
you nosy old hoot owl!

923
01:14:28,796 --> 01:14:30,764
We've come up with a new product.

924
01:14:30,965 --> 01:14:33,695
If we can produce it
and test-market it in four weeks...

925
01:14:33,901 --> 01:14:37,769
...well, then we can prove to corporate
that this plant is still worthwhile.

926
01:14:38,673 --> 01:14:39,935
A month?

927
01:14:44,178 --> 01:14:46,146
What? That's impossible.

928
01:14:48,115 --> 01:14:51,812
I mean, you're just gonna get
everybody's hopes up...

929
01:14:52,019 --> 01:14:54,283
...and then they'll all end up
out of work anyway.

930
01:14:55,389 --> 01:14:59,223
See, I think...
- No, I am not taking the fall for that.

931
01:15:01,128 --> 01:15:02,720
You're on your own, lady.

932
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,206
So that's the plan,
and to make it work...

933
01:15:23,417 --> 01:15:26,648
...we're gonna recommission
the old-fashioned yogurt equipment.

934
01:15:26,854 --> 01:15:28,583
It's gonna take a lot of long hours.

935
01:15:28,789 --> 01:15:31,314
How much overtime
are you authorized for?

936
01:15:31,525 --> 01:15:32,514
None.

937
01:15:32,727 --> 01:15:34,319
And if the Munck-ees don't buy it?

938
01:15:34,528 --> 01:15:38,931
We'll put in a whole lot of work
and end up out on our asses anyway.

939
01:15:39,133 --> 01:15:43,263
Yeah, yeah, I'm not gonna lie to you.
The odds are that's what will happen.

940
01:15:43,471 --> 01:15:44,870
But if it's any consolation...

941
01:15:45,072 --> 01:15:48,838
...l'm gonna be out of a job
right alongside the rest of you.

942
01:15:49,043 --> 01:15:52,774
I mean,
I am betting my career on this.

943
01:15:53,514 --> 01:15:56,347
Why? I don't know.

944
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:58,381
When I came here
did I think that this...

945
01:15:58,586 --> 01:16:01,020
...was gonna matter this much? No.

946
01:16:01,455 --> 01:16:04,947
But does it matter? Yeah.

947
01:16:05,526 --> 01:16:09,326
Yeah, absolutely. It matters a lot.

948
01:16:14,435 --> 01:16:18,565
And you can sure betcha we'll be out
on our asses if we don't try.

949
01:16:20,841 --> 01:16:23,435
You got something
better to do there, Lars?

950
01:16:23,878 --> 01:16:26,779
And I gotta say I don't exactly
picture prospective employers...

951
01:16:26,981 --> 01:16:29,609
...lining up to fight over
a dumb son of a bitch like Bob.

952
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:40,418
They might padlock this place,
let the whole town come to rust.

953
01:16:42,163 --> 01:16:45,394
But if that's the way it goes,
I don't wanna be thinking...

954
01:16:45,599 --> 01:16:49,899
...this gal offered a chance
and I didn't do a thing about it.

955
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,608
You can count me in.

956
01:17:40,421 --> 01:17:42,446
They teach you that
in your management books?

957
01:17:44,191 --> 01:17:47,490
Is this a surprise compliance visit
from the union?

958
01:17:47,695 --> 01:17:51,062
Maybe.
I heard about what you're doing.

959
01:17:55,736 --> 01:18:00,799
Look, I'm not sure why I came here,
but maybe I can help.

960
01:18:11,051 --> 01:18:14,714
Crank it a little bit more.
Yup, crank it, a little bit more.

961
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:18,483
All right, Bob, turn her on.

962
01:18:20,294 --> 01:18:22,091
Hold it. Turn her off, Bob.

963
01:18:22,296 --> 01:18:24,423
Great.
- Hang on, trade me spots here, Ted.

964
01:18:24,632 --> 01:18:26,259
Okay, go on, get in there.

965
01:18:26,834 --> 01:18:29,530
Okay, let's do this other one.
- All right.

966
01:18:29,737 --> 01:18:31,295
Turn it on, please.

967
01:18:31,505 --> 01:18:33,632
Put it off, Bob.

968
01:18:37,344 --> 01:18:38,333
That's funny?

969
01:18:40,181 --> 01:18:42,081
No, no, no.
- Yeah, that's funny though.

970
01:18:42,283 --> 01:18:44,877
Yeah, all right.
Bob, do me a favor, please turn it on.

971
01:19:08,175 --> 01:19:13,044
And I swear never to reveal
Blanche's secret tapioca recipe...

972
01:19:13,247 --> 01:19:19,311
...to anyone from a rival company
or to Trudy Van Uuden.

973
01:19:20,721 --> 01:19:22,586
I swear.

974
01:20:10,604 --> 01:20:13,038
Mr. Arling
from the home office on line one.

975
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,708
And if you ask me,
he doesn't sound any too pleased.

976
01:20:23,784 --> 01:20:26,810
Donald, funny you should call.

977
01:20:47,107 --> 01:20:48,233
Yes, yes, Donald.

978
01:20:48,442 --> 01:20:52,970
I do realize that I did this
with absolutely no authorization.

979
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:54,613
Don't think I'm not pissed.

980
01:20:54,815 --> 01:20:58,114
You'd be out on your ass if those
regional tests weren't off the charts.

981
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:02,380
It doesn't hurt that Wallace's
grandkids are big on the butterscotch.

982
01:21:04,725 --> 01:21:06,158
This is Blanche Gunderson.

983
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,055
She's our head
of Product Development.

984
01:21:08,262 --> 01:21:10,924
Oh, heavens no, I'm just...

985
01:21:11,131 --> 01:21:13,622
Oh, I'm pleased as punch
to meet you.

986
01:21:13,834 --> 01:21:15,802
Yeah.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

987
01:21:16,003 --> 01:21:17,698
It's all right, it's okay.
- Oh, dear.

988
01:21:17,905 --> 01:21:19,634
Yeah, yeah.

989
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:23,867
Well, they never would have thought
it would be more cost-effective...

990
01:21:24,078 --> 01:21:28,674
...to use the current labor force and
the old machine line than robotics...

991
01:21:28,882 --> 01:21:30,873
...but we showed them.

992
01:21:31,085 --> 01:21:32,643
They want to ramp up production...

993
01:21:32,853 --> 01:21:35,845
...and ship nationally
by the end of the month.

994
01:21:41,328 --> 01:21:43,990
How does it feel
to be the newest vice president?

995
01:21:44,198 --> 01:21:46,962
We'll expect you in Miami
next week.

996
01:22:04,451 --> 01:22:06,544
Hey.
- Hi.

997
01:22:06,754 --> 01:22:08,244
How you doing?
- I'm all right.

998
01:22:08,455 --> 01:22:11,322
How are you?
- I'm all right.

999
01:22:11,525 --> 01:22:14,187
It's real noisy in there so...

1000
01:22:14,828 --> 01:22:18,992
I thought I'd tell you goodbye
out here.

1001
01:22:21,135 --> 01:22:25,538
You know, you've done some
pretty amazing things around here.

1002
01:22:25,739 --> 01:22:27,604
Thank you.

1003
01:22:30,377 --> 01:22:34,074
Everybody in this whole town
is really gonna miss you a lot.

1004
01:22:38,619 --> 01:22:40,177
Especially me.

1005
01:22:48,562 --> 01:22:51,190
There's people in there
waiting to give you a sendoff.

1006
01:22:51,398 --> 01:22:54,697
You don't want to miss that.
You may wanna...

1007
01:22:56,904 --> 01:22:58,667
Yeah.

1008
01:23:14,988 --> 01:23:18,480
So I'll see you...
- Yeah, I'll be in there in a while.

1009
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:20,849
Okay.

1010
01:23:55,662 --> 01:23:58,460
It'll be nice getting back
to civilization.

1011
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:01,233
How do people live here?

1012
01:25:52,946 --> 01:25:55,312
How many queens
did you plant in this deck, Maurice?

1013
01:25:55,515 --> 01:25:58,245
Four or five, give or take a couple.

1014
01:25:59,853 --> 01:26:01,411
Hey, fellas.

1015
01:26:02,422 --> 01:26:05,414
Ted, we gotta talk.

1016
01:26:10,097 --> 01:26:12,065
Hey, Nina,
give me a Maker's Mark.

1017
01:26:15,269 --> 01:26:19,933
Well, it looks like we're just
too successful for our own damn good.

1018
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:24,470
Just got wind from Fagerbache
in Distribution, the plant's being sold.

1019
01:26:24,678 --> 01:26:28,079
Some muckety-muck from HQ
is coming to tell us about it.

1020
01:26:28,282 --> 01:26:29,715
Sold?

1021
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:31,781
Yeah, it's a heck of a deal.

1022
01:26:31,985 --> 01:26:34,453
They're gonna move
our product line out of here.

1023
01:26:34,655 --> 01:26:37,453
Faster than thin shit
through a tall Swede.

1024
01:26:37,658 --> 01:26:40,718
I'm surprised your little sweetie-pie
vice president...

1025
01:26:40,927 --> 01:26:43,293
...didn't send you the memo.

1026
01:26:58,278 --> 01:26:59,540
So ridiculous.

1027
01:26:59,746 --> 01:27:03,079
It was my secret, now it's being
shipped off with the plant.

1028
01:27:15,529 --> 01:27:17,963
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna accept
anything less...

1029
01:27:18,165 --> 01:27:21,134
...than two weeks' salary
for every year worked.

1030
01:27:51,398 --> 01:27:52,888
I understand that you've heard...

1031
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:56,536
...of Munck Foods' planned sale
of this facility.

1032
01:27:57,104 --> 01:27:58,662
Yeah.

1033
01:28:00,507 --> 01:28:04,034
Well, I've assembled
some industrial investors...

1034
01:28:04,644 --> 01:28:08,603
...to back us in buying this plant,
product line and all.

1035
01:28:08,815 --> 01:28:11,648
At a fixed rate,
you'll buy the new company back...

1036
01:28:11,852 --> 01:28:15,845
...until it is entirely owner-operated.

1037
01:28:17,324 --> 01:28:19,622
Well, how do we know
we can we trust these guys?

1038
01:28:19,826 --> 01:28:21,123
Yeah.

1039
01:28:22,129 --> 01:28:23,960
You won't have to.

1040
01:28:25,065 --> 01:28:27,124
You can trust me.

1041
01:28:28,935 --> 01:28:32,894
I wanna come back
as this company's CEO.

1042
01:28:33,106 --> 01:28:36,132
Well, would you look at Miss CEO?

1043
01:28:36,343 --> 01:28:39,744
As I recall, first,
you got us to risk everything.

1044
01:28:39,946 --> 01:28:43,780
Then you left us behind, you know?

1045
01:28:43,984 --> 01:28:46,851
And then you got them...

1046
01:28:47,053 --> 01:28:49,613
...to buy the company
out right from under our feet.

1047
01:28:49,823 --> 01:28:52,155
And now you have this idea...

1048
01:28:52,359 --> 01:28:54,884
...about how we're supposed
to buy our own company back.

1049
01:28:55,095 --> 01:28:56,562
Well, that changes everything.

1050
01:28:59,266 --> 01:29:02,258
Are you prepared
to deal with the union on this?

1051
01:29:09,476 --> 01:29:12,309
I'm sure we could come
to some agreement.

1052
01:29:13,046 --> 01:29:16,573
It's gonna take a little bit of time too,
it might take years.

1053
01:29:21,788 --> 01:29:24,018
My schedule's open.

1054
01:29:35,402 --> 01:29:38,769
Whoa, there, buddy, you're not...
- Hey, I just have something in my eye.

1055
01:29:38,972 --> 01:29:40,439
Damn it.

1056
01:30:19,246 --> 01:30:20,873
Now...

1057
01:30:21,648 --> 01:30:23,548
What about Johann Weinkopf?

1058
01:30:24,251 --> 01:30:26,515
Why, he'd make you
a mighty fine husband.

1059
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:27,709
He's got a lazy eye.

1060
01:30:27,921 --> 01:30:32,153
And I can never tell if he's looking
directly at me or my breast.

1061
01:30:32,359 --> 01:30:34,589
Probably looking at both.

1062
01:30:35,228 --> 01:30:37,662
Now that I think about it,
you're probably right.

1063
01:30:38,098 --> 01:30:39,360
Go on.

1064
01:30:40,567 --> 01:30:42,831
Oh, hi there, Peter.
- Here you go.

1065
01:30:49,209 --> 01:30:50,699
So...
- Okay, then.

1066
01:30:50,911 --> 01:30:52,936
You have a nice day.
- Enjoy the weather.

1067
01:30:53,146 --> 01:30:55,171
You too.
- Thank you much.

1068
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:08,790
