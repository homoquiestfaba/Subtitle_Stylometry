FRED (ON RADIO): What's
cooking, fuck chop?

7
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:02,747
Hey, Fred.

8
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:04,516
FRED (ON RADIO):
You ready for this?

9
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,552
Deb's pregnant again.

10
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:10,323
Uh, congratulations?

FRED (ON RADIO): Hey, how am I
supposed to afford a fifth kid?

12

Christ almighty.

13
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:18,798
Were you just not careful or?

14
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,798
FRED (ON RADIO): I don't know.

15
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:20,966
You know how it is.

16
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,002
Once those bodies
start slapping...

17
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:24,871

Wait, what did
you mean by cadaver?

23
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:50,622
Uncle Jesse.

24
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:51,590
What's wrong with that?

25
00:04:51,622 --> 00:04:52,692
What isn't wrong with that?

26
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:53,959
It's fucked up.

27
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:55,093
You're supposed to
respect your cadaver.

28
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:56,362
How was that not
showing respect?

29
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:57,729
Uncle Jesse is the hot uncle.

30
00:04:57,762 --> 00:04:58,997
Michael, back me up here.

31
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:00,733
What?

32
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:01,801
On your own, man.

33
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:02,768
Thank you.

34
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,402
See.

35
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:05,603
Not everyone is morally
bankrupt as you are, Justin.

36
00:05:05,637 --> 00:05:07,038
At least we're
taking pictures of him

37
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:08,708
- like that guy from last year.
- Oh, my God.

38
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,974
Yeah.

39
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:11,509
He had to face the
family and apologize.

40
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:13,745
It was a real black eye
to the nursing school.

41
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:15,981
Anyway, so we're dissecting
uncle Jesse's pelvis...

42
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:42,975
Ah.

43
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:43,975
Let me give you a ride.

00:05:47,745 --> 00:05:48,714
Just let me give you a lift.

00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:56,721
Do I need to call
the cops again, Bob?

00:05:56,754 --> 00:05:58,658

Come on.

55
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:16,541
Shut up.

56
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:17,442
Why do they call
him "Fuck You Bob"?

57
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:18,511
Wait for it.

58
00:06:18,543 --> 00:06:19,811
You're all strapped in, Bob.

59
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:20,746
Fuck you.

FRED: Hey, what's your 20?

62
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:27,952
Uh, I'm just outside the loop.

63
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:29,521
I've just picked up
Bob here, and he gave

64
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,822
me a run for my money tonight.

65
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:32,725
FRED: That's stubborn
old Bob for you.

66
00:06:32,757 --> 00:06:34,526
But tell him Fred says hi.

67
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,730
He can probably hear you.

68
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:38,997
He says hi.

69
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:44,069
FRED: Can seven, which
means signing off.

70
00:06:44,101 --> 00:06:45,837
Look at him.

71
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,138
He's all tuckered out.

72
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:48,207
I love Justin.

73
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,675
He's the best.

74
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:50,943
Yeah.

75
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:52,511
My last college didn't
have a drunk bus.

76
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:53,978
It's a great idea.

77
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:55,947
What made you decide
to become a bus driver?

78
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,185
This and, uh, nude
modeling are the two

79
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,520
highest paying jobs on campus.

80
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:02,654
No offense, dude.

81
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:03,923
I think I'd pick
the nude modeling.

82
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:07,225
Less chance of being
puked on, I guess.

83
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,961
Maybe.

84
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:12,197
Justin tells me
you're really into film.

85
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,533
I used to take a
lot of Polaroids.

86
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:16,936
Did you study photography?

87
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:18,903
Photojournalism.

88
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:22,875
But, uh, I don't, I don't, uh,
really do that stuff anymore.

89
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:25,911
I just transferred
here for museum studies.

90
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:29,148
Our big project this semester is
to curate an original art show.

91
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,983
I'm feeling really uninspired.

92
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:34,920
I'd love to see
your work sometime.

93
00:07:34,952 --> 00:07:37,055
So are you seeing someone or?

94
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:38,189
What?

95
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:39,091
Oh, yeah.

96
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:40,225
No.

97
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,694
I just, uh, went
through a breakup.

98
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:42,627
Yeah.

99
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:43,629
Try nine months ago.

100
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:44,697
Oh, I knew you were faking.

101
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:47,932
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:49,701
That really sucks.

103
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:50,603
You guys date long?

104
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,571
Uh, yeah.

105
00:07:52,603 --> 00:07:53,906
Since high school.

106
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:57,276
Amy applied to KIT,
so I applied too.

107
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:59,812
Planning on getting
married and everything.

108
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:01,080
It's stupid.

109
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:04,016
I don't think that's stupid.

110
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:04,916
What?

111
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:06,117
If I did, I'd tell you.

112
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:07,286
It's a little stupid.

113
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,220
Whatever.

114
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:10,088
So what happened?

115
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:14,627
I mean, after, uh,
after graduation,

116
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,861
she moved to New
York and said that we

117
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:16,961
should see other people.

118
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:17,896
Ugh.

119
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,766
Nine months ago.

120
00:08:20,798 --> 00:08:21,799
Uh, thank you, Justin.

121
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:22,668
Dude.

122
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,875
Got to get a stick
together, right?

123
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:33,578
You've got to stay behind
the... the... the yellow line.

124
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:37,115
My boyfriend broke
up with me today.

125

126
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:44,822

127
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:49,727
We're not supposed
to be tied down.

128
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,762
Fuck him.

129
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:51,730
Yeah.

130
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:53,132
Seriously.
Fuck him.

131
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:54,332
I'm trying to drive.

132
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:55,934
You can't, you cannot
touch my arm I...

133
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:56,968
My stomach hurts.

134
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:57,902
Here.

135
00:08:57,936 --> 00:08:58,771
Take the water.

136
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:07,346
I think she likes you.

137
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:10,249
[laughing sarcastically]

138
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:16,889
Hey.

139
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:18,290
Yep.

140
00:09:18,322 --> 00:09:21,693
I know you.

141
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:23,596
I thought you graduated already.

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,001
I think I'm gonna be sick.

143
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:31,736
No, no, please, please
don't throw up in here.

144
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:32,737
Please.

145
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,006
Please, please sit back.

Oh my God.

00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,247
Oh, she pooped!

150
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,182
She pooped!

151
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,016
Oh my god!

[gagging]

153
00:10:13,678 --> 00:10:14,812
OK.

154
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:15,748
Put that down.

155
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,914
Take a bite.

156
00:10:16,947 --> 00:10:20,918
Is that bacon on a donut?

157
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:24,155
It is a caramel bacon donut.

158
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:25,357
They were out of
everything else.

159
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:33,432
Well, that's, that's awesome.

160
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:34,966
It's OK.

161
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:46,445
You're awesome, and I
think we should do it.

162
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:49,213
Let's get a place.

163
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:50,982
I thought you said
you weren't ready.

164
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:53,384
I am ready, and you're right.

165
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:57,990
We do, we do work
really well together.

166
00:10:58,023 --> 00:10:59,358
[interposing voices]

167
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,225
Cool.

168
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:02,728
Yeah.

169
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,697
I love you.

170
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,965
I love you too.

171
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:12,838
Woo hoo!

172
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,874
Is tonight the night?

173
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:18,844
[music playing]

174
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:23,247
(SINGING) Lady, you
showed me [inaudible]

175
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,218
all the tears you brought me.

176
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:29,221
Broke my one rule.

177
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:31,824
You treated me cruel.

178
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:34,759
[phone ringing]

179
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:47,805
SISTER: (MUFFLED) Hello.

180
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,874
Oh.
Whoa.

181
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:50,309
You're awake.

182
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:52,244
Was just gonna leave
you a voicemail.

183
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:53,378
How's it going?

184
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,779
SISTER: Good.

185
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:55,847
Mom wants you to
call her, by the way.

186
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,781
Oh, yeah.

187
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:57,516
I gotta do that.

So listen, a paid internship
just opened up in my office.

190
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:02,455
Interested?

town forever, waiting,

come to Chicago and move on.

Oh.

My pee always smells like,
uh, movie theatre popcorn.

211

You know, like, fake,
hot butter stuff.

212
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,206
I mean, don't get me wrong.

213
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,509
I will still crush a bucket of
that stuff, no questions asked.

214
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:33,412
I'm just saying,
like, if the ushers

215
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,414

How would we ever know?

217
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:39,484
There's no chance we would know.

218

eaten some usher's piss.

I think you were Michael
and Amy for so long

269

that you forgot how
to be just Michael.

I'm alone on the
bus every night.

Afterwards, I went and
traveled South America

275

by myself, which was scary.

276
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:39,430
It was fun.

277

At times, it was, but, you
know, the world didn't end.

281
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:49,341
It's OK to be by yourself.

in a crappy relationship

to South America.

it, or if you would just

Fred for me, like I asked,

307

to hire you back.

Josh, you know why not.

311
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:10,521
It's because I'm a registered
sex offender, isn't it?

OK.

00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:47,305
[bus engine starts]

369
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:24,541
It smells like shit in here.

370
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:26,644
Like, actual shit.

371
00:22:26,676 --> 00:22:29,546
Did you shit?

372
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:31,682
I'm Pineapple.

373
00:22:31,715 --> 00:22:34,051
You say your name's Pineapple?

374
00:22:34,085 --> 00:22:35,886
Yeah.

375
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,589
The bus service.

376
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:38,923
They hired me.

377
00:22:38,955 --> 00:22:43,394
To give me a tattoo?

378
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,529
No.

379
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:45,729
To protect you.

380
00:22:45,762 --> 00:22:48,732
I'm in security.

381
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:49,667
Oh, dude.

382
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,934
No.

383
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:52,437
I, I've been doing
this for a long time.

384
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,637
That kid was just being a dick.

385
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:55,038
I... I really...

386
00:22:55,071 --> 00:22:56,640
I don't need any, you know...

387
00:22:56,673 --> 00:22:58,576
Sure about that, homie?

388
00:22:58,608 --> 00:22:59,977
Doesn't look too good.

389
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,945
Here, try this.

390
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:04,548
It's witch hazel.

391
00:23:04,582 --> 00:23:07,519
It will help with
the inflammation.

392
00:23:07,551 --> 00:23:09,620
You carry witch
hazel with you?

393
00:23:09,653 --> 00:23:11,823
Yeah.

394
00:23:11,855 --> 00:23:13,424
Look.

395
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,527
Next time some drunk
motherfucker steps you, give

396
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:18,061
them one of these to the head.

397
00:23:18,095 --> 00:23:20,198
Will stop the fight
before it even starts.

398
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,166
Here, try it.

399
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,468
I'm good.

400
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,735
Go ahead.

401
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:26,770
Hit it.

402
00:23:26,804 --> 00:23:29,541
What the fuck was that bullshit?

403
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,509
Headbutt my fucking hand.

404
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,578
There you go.

405
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:37,015
It's better than breaking your
hand on some joker's face,

406
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,083
'cause then you gotta
fuck your other hand,

407
00:23:39,115 --> 00:23:41,519
and that definitely sucks.

408
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:42,586
FRED (ON RADIO): Hey, fuck chop.

409
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:44,588
You didn't leave yet, did you?

410
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:45,890
No, I'm... I'm...

411
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:46,924
I'm still here.

412
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,692
Did you guys hire a, um-

413
00:23:48,726 --> 00:23:50,628
FRED (ON RADIO): Well, due to
last night's incident, which

414
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:52,864
won't affect your eligibility
for the safety award,

415
00:23:52,896 --> 00:23:57,167
so don't worry, we hired a guy
at work security temporarily.

416
00:23:57,201 --> 00:23:59,103
He calls himself Pineapple.

417
00:23:59,135 --> 00:24:00,771
Fred.

418
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:02,707
FRED (ON RADIO): He's got
tattoos covering his face.

419
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,807
Wait till you see this fat fuck.

420
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,609
Fred.

421
00:24:05,643 --> 00:24:07,846
FRED (ON RADIO): Dude looks like
a Darth Maul fucked fat Albert.

422
00:24:07,878 --> 00:24:09,480
- I'm not shitting you...
- Fred.

423
00:24:09,513 --> 00:24:11,014
FRED (ON RADIO): Now, if
tons of fun gives you...

424
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:13,518
Hey, Fred.

425
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,086
It's Pineapple.

426
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:19,490
You want me to come in
there and murder you?

427
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:24,863
FRED (ON RADIO): That
won't be, uh, necessary.

428
00:24:24,895 --> 00:24:27,865
Uh, you... hey, you
all be safe out there.

429
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:29,500
You too, Fred.

430
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,503
FRED (ON RADIO): We joke
around here, Pineapple.

431
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:32,703
PINEAPPLE: Let's go.

432
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:33,872
FRED (ON RADIO): I
knew you were there.

433
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,987
Yo.

434
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:50,754
You ever hit it
with a passenger?

435
00:24:50,788 --> 00:24:53,825
Usually, just, uh, drive
them to the bars and back.

436
00:24:53,857 --> 00:24:55,158
Shit, son.

437
00:24:55,192 --> 00:24:56,760
Do you even know
what you missing?

438
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,031
What?

439
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:01,798
You got a girlfriend?

440
00:25:01,832 --> 00:25:07,205
Uh, yeah, uh, she's
in, uh, in New York.

441
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:10,041
[speaking samoan]

442
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:11,910
What?

443
00:25:11,942 --> 00:25:14,144
It's Samoan, man.

444
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:17,081
It means, the net's
hanging up to dry,

445
00:25:17,114 --> 00:25:20,817
but it'll be used
for fishing again.

446
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:23,922
Kind of just got to, uh,
focus on the road here, man.

447
00:25:23,954 --> 00:25:25,088
My bad.

448
00:25:25,122 --> 00:25:25,957
You do you.

449
00:25:34,632 --> 00:25:36,200
What?

450
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:42,039
Tell me if I'm off base, but
you never shampooed the wookie.

451
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,108
I had a girlfriend
for five years.

452
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:47,077
Yeah, but it didn't mean
you got your twinkie stinky.

453
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:48,012
It's all right, man.

454
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:50,949
Just own it.

455
00:25:50,981 --> 00:25:54,251
So am I wrong?

456
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:09,933
Love you.
Goodnight.

457
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:10,868
Love you.

458
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:11,736
Night.

459
00:26:16,773 --> 00:26:18,775
What's that doing here?

460
00:26:18,808 --> 00:26:19,911
What?

461
00:26:19,943 --> 00:26:22,713
You're poking me
with your boner.

462
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,349
I can't really help it.

463
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,784
Then maybe go to the bathroom
and jerk off or something.

464
00:26:26,817 --> 00:26:27,986
I have to get up early tomorrow.

465
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,891
Why is premarital
sex so wrong, but

466
00:26:33,923 --> 00:26:35,893
masturbating's totally fine?

467
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:38,096
Because you're the one who
has to answer to the Lord

468
00:26:38,128 --> 00:26:41,164
for your behavior, not me.

469
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:44,134
Night.

470
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,036
So you're a virgin.

471
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:47,171
Keep it down, man.

472
00:26:47,203 --> 00:26:48,038
Come on.

473
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,076
What is that shit
you're drinking?

474
00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:53,744
It smells like absolute ass.

475
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,947
Oh, it's
traditional Maui soup.

476
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,983
Pureed seafood, pork bones,
some other shit in it.

477
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:00,884
You want some?

478
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:02,319
No, I'll pass.

479
00:27:02,353 --> 00:27:03,622
More for me.

480
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,326
So what's Amy doing besides cock
teasing in the Five Boroughs?

481
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:12,429
She's a junior fashion buyer.

482
00:27:12,462 --> 00:27:15,098
She did text me saying she's
going to be in town next week,

483
00:27:15,132 --> 00:27:18,169
and there was a winky
smiley face involved so.

484
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:22,272
So that means she
wants your dick.

485
00:27:22,306 --> 00:27:25,242
Dude, we gotta get you laid.

486
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,711
Fucking's important.

487
00:27:27,744 --> 00:27:29,846
A buddy of mine, he got married.

488
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,950
On his wedding night, found out
she got an inside-out vagina.

489
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:34,418
What's an inside-out vagina?

490
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:36,186
Fuck if I know.

491
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,822
He wasn't really taking
follow up questions.

492
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:38,722
You feel me?

493
00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:40,191
A penis?

494
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:42,426
Could be.

495
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,096
Look, my point is you got
to make sure the parts fit

496
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:46,965
before you commit.

497
00:27:49,866 --> 00:27:50,768
Yo.

498
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,403
Let me get in on that.

499
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:16,994
Oh, uh, Pineapple, it's Bob.

500
00:28:17,027 --> 00:28:19,197
Bob, that's Pineapple.

501
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,397
Yo, what's up, Bob?

502
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:26,336
You.

503
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:28,805
This guy's awesome.

504
00:28:28,838 --> 00:28:30,240
Where do you take him?

505
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:32,109
If we can actually convince
him to get on the bus,

506
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,112
I usually drop him off
at the old flour mill.

507
00:28:34,144 --> 00:28:36,413
Oh, yeah, what's over there?

508
00:28:36,446 --> 00:28:37,447
I don't know.

509
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,250
He's definitely not telling.

510
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:42,185
Apparently, he used to
teach art here in the 70s.

511
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:43,086
No one really knows.

512
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:43,954
He's kind of a mystery.

513
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:52,230
Yo.

514
00:28:52,262 --> 00:28:55,165
You see those two
girls back there?

515
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:58,769
If I get them to kiss, you
let me get behind the wheel.

516
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,105
Go for it.

517
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:06,544
Check check.

518
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:08,378
How's everybody doing
out there tonight?

519
00:29:11,248 --> 00:29:15,286
I said, how's everybody
doing out there tonight?

520
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:18,188
[cheering]

521
00:29:19,856 --> 00:29:20,524
Yeah, this is good.

522
00:29:24,127 --> 00:29:25,028
Come on, guys.

523
00:29:25,061 --> 00:29:27,998
Get up.

524
00:29:28,031 --> 00:29:28,932
Get up.

525
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,875
Damn.

526
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:54,291
Look, dude.

527
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,526
It's going to happen.

528
00:29:55,558 --> 00:29:56,560
Look.

529
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:57,862
Going to fucking happen.

530
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:03,233
Ah, ah.

531
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:05,202
Aah!

532
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:07,572
Yo, yo, check it!

533
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,039
Ugh.

534
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:15,046
[chuckling] This
thing handles like shit.

535
00:30:15,078 --> 00:30:15,980
I know.

536
00:30:16,012 --> 00:30:16,913
You get used to it.

537
00:30:16,946 --> 00:30:19,250
Just be careful please.

538
00:30:19,282 --> 00:30:23,920
So you drive the same
route, night after night,

539
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:24,922
over and over?

540
00:30:24,954 --> 00:30:25,923
That's the job.

541
00:30:25,955 --> 00:30:27,057
You ever go off-route?

542
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,426
You're supposed
to stay on-route.

543
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,895
What'd you do if I took
this bitch on the highway?

544
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:35,432
I would lose my job and then
probably get arrested so let's

545
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:36,300
not do that.

546
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,072
What the fuck was that?

547
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,941
Frat kids.

548
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:45,442
Do this a lot?

549
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,578
Pretty much every night

550
00:30:47,611 --> 00:30:50,114
I'm going to ask
you a question,

551
00:30:50,146 --> 00:30:52,649
and I want you to
answer me truthfully.

552
00:30:52,682 --> 00:30:55,987
Do you want me to murder them?

553
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:58,154
FRED (ON RADIO): What's
your 20, fuck chop?

554
00:30:58,188 --> 00:31:01,592
Uh, uh, uh, uh, frat row.

555
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,493
FRED (ON RADIO): 10-4.

556
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:06,096
Hey, I feel like I may
have put too much pressure

557
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,165
on you before about
the, uh, you know,

558
00:31:08,198 --> 00:31:10,268
the whole safety award thing.

559
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,569
I'd like to give you some
advice that my mentor,

560
00:31:12,603 --> 00:31:16,340
the late great king of the
bus jockeys, Alan Clapper,

561
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:18,342
once gave me when
I was your age.

562
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:21,945
I hope it means as much
to you as it did to me.

563
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:24,181
[farting]

564
00:31:24,213 --> 00:31:25,482
Shit right now.

565
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,183
FRED (ON RADIO): You
get all that, fuck chop?

566
00:31:27,217 --> 00:31:28,986
I'm not even
responding to that.

567
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:30,654
I'm not wasting my fucking time.

568
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:33,457
Same shit,
different toilet, huh?

569
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,660
No, actually, it's more,
it's the same toilet,

570
00:31:35,692 --> 00:31:38,028
and it's constantly overflowing.

571
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:38,962
What time is it?

572
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:39,964
1:39.

573
00:31:39,997 --> 00:31:41,632
We pass, uh, we pass Zephyr.

574
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:44,335
There's going to be a lady in
a green coat, walking her dog.

575
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:45,602
Just going to smell its shit.

576
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:46,436
Swear to God.

577
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,143
Oh, no.

578
00:31:52,175 --> 00:31:53,043
Ugh.

579
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:54,478
Oh, it's my favorite.

580
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:58,348
Whoever updates that marquee
can't spell for shit.

581
00:31:58,382 --> 00:32:00,951
Free turnovers, yo.

582
00:32:00,984 --> 00:32:02,419
Oh, you see these
Christmas lights?

583
00:32:02,452 --> 00:32:03,354
Yeah, man.

584
00:32:03,386 --> 00:32:04,321
It's February.

585
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:05,957
They're on a timer.

586
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,557
And off.

587
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,027
There's some
crazy deja vu shit.

588
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,495
Reminds me of juvie.

589
00:32:12,528 --> 00:32:15,031
You were in
juvenile detention?

590
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:16,334
Yeah, man.

591
00:32:16,366 --> 00:32:20,604
I did a year for B and
E back when I was 16.

592
00:32:20,636 --> 00:32:23,073
You must have owned the place.

593
00:32:23,106 --> 00:32:24,541
Nah.

594
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:30,081
It was the same shit, day
after day, over and over.

595
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,750
It was like being
stuck in a time loop.

596
00:32:32,782 --> 00:32:34,517
But big-ups to you, man.

597
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,619
I don't know how
the fuck you do it.

598
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:41,158
Trains.

599
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,306
You're going to
drive yourself nuts.

600
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:02,580
You're going to drive yourself
nuts obsessing over that text.

601
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:05,016
What's with the winky
smiley face, though?

602
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:07,317
What am I, what am I
supposed to think that she

603
00:33:07,351 --> 00:33:08,753
thinks that that means?

604
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:09,620
Who cares?

605
00:33:12,756 --> 00:33:14,557
Man... Forget about it.

606
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,659
I'll see you tomorrow, kid.

607
00:33:16,692 --> 00:33:18,128
Pineapple.

608
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,498
Wait, what, what were
you going to say?

609
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,398
Pineapple.

610
00:33:26,135 --> 00:33:28,538
Pineapple, what were
you going to say?

611
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:29,472
Pineapple, come on.

612
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:30,807
Dude.

613
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,710
You're taking the small
shit in your small life

614
00:33:33,743 --> 00:33:37,714
and making a huge
deal out of it.

615
00:33:37,748 --> 00:33:41,117
What?

616
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:42,019
Pineapple.

617
00:33:47,657 --> 00:33:49,159
What are you talking about?

618
00:33:49,192 --> 00:33:50,795
Dude.

619
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:52,562
None of it matters.

620
00:33:52,596 --> 00:33:58,134
Your job, Amy,
the text, college.

621
00:33:58,167 --> 00:33:59,502
None of this matters.

622
00:33:59,536 --> 00:34:00,371
You feel me?

623
00:34:03,373 --> 00:34:06,610
A wise Samoan once said,
Change doesn't begin when

624
00:34:06,643 --> 00:34:09,146
you get a knock on your ass.

625
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,449
It begins when you decide
to get on your feet again.

626
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:13,583
Is that another old proverb?

627
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:15,352
No.

628
00:34:15,385 --> 00:34:19,590
That's Dwayne the
motherfucking Rock Johnson.

629
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:20,657
See you tomorrow, kid.

630
00:34:53,657 --> 00:34:57,161
[phone ringing]

631
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:06,369
Oh, great.

632
00:35:06,402 --> 00:35:07,304
JOSH: Crap.

633
00:35:10,806 --> 00:35:12,542
TV: Voice assistance by...

634
00:35:22,585 --> 00:35:24,921
This is what's
considered fun now?

635
00:35:24,954 --> 00:35:26,723
I can do it all night.

636
00:35:30,293 --> 00:35:31,494
JUSTIN: Aw.

637
00:35:31,527 --> 00:35:32,762
That is a loose septum.

638
00:35:32,795 --> 00:35:34,731
Gonna have to do
better than that.

639
00:35:38,568 --> 00:35:40,170
That is the single
grossest thing

640
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:41,438
I have ever seen in my life.

641
00:35:41,471 --> 00:35:42,706
Where's your wallet?

642
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:44,875
It's right here.

643
00:35:44,907 --> 00:35:45,875
Yo.

644
00:35:45,909 --> 00:35:47,411
Who the fuck took my wallet?

645
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:49,679
[whistling]

646
00:35:49,713 --> 00:35:50,781
You got mad skills.

647
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:52,215
Respect.
Yo!

648
00:35:52,248 --> 00:35:53,216
Get the fuck out of my face!

649
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,784
Sit the fuck down.

650
00:35:54,818 --> 00:35:56,487
Chill the fuck out.

651
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:59,222
Jesus.

652
00:35:59,255 --> 00:36:00,723
What do you guys think of him?

653
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:02,860
I already like him better
than I ever liked you.

654
00:36:02,893 --> 00:36:04,595
Nobody messes with
you when he's around.

655
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:05,596
Look at him.

656
00:36:05,628 --> 00:36:09,400
He's like the bro whisperer.

657
00:36:09,432 --> 00:36:10,333
What?

658
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:11,569
You look high as fuck.

659
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:13,203
I wish.

660
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,572
Nope.

661
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:15,806
All Tara.

662
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:17,541
Who's Tara?

663
00:36:17,574 --> 00:36:19,677
She's a psycho who lives
in the dorm room next to Kat.

664
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,844
She has night terrors.

665
00:36:20,876 --> 00:36:22,545
What are night terrors?

666
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:24,748
It's, like, a condition
where you scream

667
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,617
and thrash around your sleep,
but you're technically,

668
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,952
like, fully asleep.

669
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:30,853
We call her Night Tara.

670
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:33,289
No, you call her Night Tara.

671
00:36:33,322 --> 00:36:34,791
Did it hurt?

672
00:36:34,824 --> 00:36:38,528
Yeah, it fucking hurt, but
it's tradition, you know.

673
00:36:38,561 --> 00:36:39,496
Look.

674
00:36:39,528 --> 00:36:40,898
I'm at the shop every day.

675
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:42,365
Come on and see me.
I'll hook you up, all right?

676
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:43,299
Yeah, sweet.

677
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:44,468
You guys cool?

678
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:45,402
Yeah.

679
00:36:45,434 --> 00:36:48,005
Shake.

680
00:36:48,038 --> 00:36:50,240
Hug.

681
00:36:50,273 --> 00:36:50,974
Come on.

682
00:36:51,007 --> 00:36:51,875
Get in there.

683
00:36:51,907 --> 00:36:53,409
All right.

684
00:36:53,443 --> 00:36:55,379
Because if I have to
come back here again,

685
00:36:55,411 --> 00:36:57,280
I'm going to rip your
fucking arms off.

686
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:01,719
Yo.

687
00:37:01,751 --> 00:37:03,519
How do you do that?

688
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:04,621
Do what?

689
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,757
Calm those idiots down.

690
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:08,324
Ah.

691
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:09,760
Dude's don't want to fight, man.

692
00:37:09,793 --> 00:37:11,394
They want someone
to break it up,

693
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:14,431
so they save face and
still look tough, you know?

694
00:37:14,463 --> 00:37:18,369
You're like Yoda.

695
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,804
If Yoda ate Jabba the Hutt.

696
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:23,740
I'm just good at talking
sense into people, you know?

697
00:37:23,773 --> 00:37:25,842
Hey, you should
meet Justin's parents.

698
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,278
They're the last two people on
Earth who don't know he's gay.

699
00:37:28,311 --> 00:37:30,813
Well, I'm fine with them
thinking Kat's my girlfriend.

700
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:33,951
Even if she is the
spawn of the colonizer.

701
00:37:33,983 --> 00:37:35,385
Give me their number.

702
00:37:35,418 --> 00:37:36,819
I'll fucking tell them.
I don't care.

703
00:37:36,853 --> 00:37:37,755
Yeah, right.

704
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:38,889
No, really.

705
00:37:38,922 --> 00:37:40,356
I'll tell them for you.

706
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:41,858
- We're not doing this.
- Yeah, we should.

707
00:37:41,891 --> 00:37:43,426
- No, we're not doing this.
- It's good for the soul.

708
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,262
Shut the fuck up.

709
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:48,632
I'm really starving.

710
00:37:48,664 --> 00:37:49,599
You wanna jump off?

711
00:37:49,632 --> 00:37:50,867
Here?

712
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,403
There's a [inaudible]
around the corner.

713
00:37:53,436 --> 00:37:54,538
Ah, fine.

714
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:57,641
But I'm never
going to eat again.

715
00:37:57,673 --> 00:37:59,076
- Bye, Pineapple.
- Later, yo.

716
00:37:59,108 --> 00:37:59,976
Bye.

717
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,478
See you guys.

718
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:04,514
Dude, she was a fucking
senior virgin, bro.

719
00:38:04,547 --> 00:38:08,718
Dude, after sophomore year,
there are no more virgins.

720
00:38:08,751 --> 00:38:10,320
She had to be lying.

721
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:12,422
Dude, she's super fucking
Catholic or some shit.

722
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,757
Convinced some fucking
sorry motherfucker

723
00:38:13,789 --> 00:38:15,358
they should wait till marriage.

724
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:18,561
She traded in God for Todd.

725
00:38:18,594 --> 00:38:20,563
Dude, don't fucking
touch me, bro.

726
00:38:20,597 --> 00:38:22,566
Todd forgives, though.

727
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,902
Todd moves in mysterious ways.

728
00:38:24,934 --> 00:38:25,869
FRAT BOY: Where is she now?

729
00:38:25,902 --> 00:38:26,836
New York?

730
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:30,039
I don't fucking know, man.

731
00:38:30,072 --> 00:38:31,507
Not on my dick.

732
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:33,010
It's all too irrelevant to me.

733
00:38:33,043 --> 00:38:34,811
FRAT BOY: What the hell
was her name again?

734
00:38:34,844 --> 00:38:36,946
Jamie.

735
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,817
No, wait.

736
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:41,384
Amy.

737
00:38:41,418 --> 00:38:42,653
Yeah, that's it, dude.

738
00:38:46,056 --> 00:38:47,590
I'm sorry, Bob.
You're good.

739
00:38:47,623 --> 00:38:48,458
BOB: Fuck you.

740
00:38:51,994 --> 00:38:52,962
See you, Bob.

741
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:59,135
You're doing all right?

742
00:38:59,168 --> 00:39:01,003
You look whiter than usual.

743
00:39:01,036 --> 00:39:03,706
That guy in there, Todd.

744
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:05,541
He had sex with Amy.

745

746
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:08,846
Amy who?

747
00:39:08,878 --> 00:39:09,947
Argh.

749
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,783
TODD: Let's fucking
go, bus bitch.

750
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,822
Are we going to
fucking move or what?

751

that guy, don't you?

That's your answer
to everything.

754
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,501
Because it works.

755

Don't worry about his boy.

756
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,037
I'll take care of him.

757

Argh!

758
00:39:35,871 --> 00:39:38,007
At some point, you're going to
have to make an actual decision

759

760
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,679
Might as well go in
there and headbutt Todd.

761
00:39:42,711 --> 00:39:45,615
I don't think you know me
well enough to be saying that.

762
00:39:45,648 --> 00:39:48,418
I had you figured out
the minute I met you.

763
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,521
Now, get in there and headbutt
that smug motherfucker.

764
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,389

765
00:40:07,637 --> 00:40:09,606
The fuck's your problem, bro?

766
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,052
Um, there's no open
containers on the bus.

767
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:22,887
Sorry.

00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:50,514
Finally.

771
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:01,692
Yo.

772
00:41:01,724 --> 00:41:02,559

773
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,166
Man, don't you fucking text her.

774
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:12,969
This guy is just like the
complete opposite of me.

775
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,239
I don't understand.

776
00:41:15,271 --> 00:41:18,976
I gotta know if they hooked up
before or after we broke up,

777
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:20,543
and that's it.

778
00:41:20,577 --> 00:41:23,213
You think she's out
there thinking about you?

779
00:41:23,246 --> 00:41:24,847
She's not.

780
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,252
She's probably fucked 10
more guys by now too, man.

781
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,521
So how come you never left
Kent after all that went down.

782
00:41:31,554 --> 00:41:32,788
Hmm.

783
00:41:32,822 --> 00:41:33,789
Nothing better to do.

784
00:41:33,822 --> 00:41:35,057
That's a stupid answer.

785
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:35,958
Why?

786
00:41:35,992 --> 00:41:37,594
Why are you here?

787
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:39,295
Why would you leave a
tropical paradise for Ohio?

788
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:42,266
KIT's got a sick
ass nursing school.

789
00:41:42,298 --> 00:41:43,634
Nursing?

790
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:46,269
Sick ass.

791
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:48,070
That's awe... that's awesome.

792
00:41:48,103 --> 00:41:50,306
My professors,
they told me I was

793
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,843
going to scare the patients.

794
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:54,211
Whatever.

795
00:41:54,244 --> 00:41:57,047
So you, you dropped out?

796
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:59,549
No, I left when my
lady got pregnant.

797
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,284
Wait.

798
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:01,318
You have a kid?

799
00:42:01,351 --> 00:42:04,186
Yeah, man.

800
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:05,622
She's going to be 11 this month.

801
00:42:08,257 --> 00:42:10,026
I'm just fucking with you.

802
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:12,028
That's her.

804
00:42:16,298 --> 00:42:18,802
Are you and the mom
still, uh, cool or?

805
00:42:18,835 --> 00:42:20,737
Nah.

Katie lives with
her up in Cleveland,

807

but I still support her.

808

That's why I got the job
protecting your bitch ass.

What is, what is,
can we, think about...

810
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,617
She's cool with it.

811
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,818
She's used to it, anyways.

812
00:42:35,851 --> 00:42:37,353
Sometimes her classmates
make fun of her,

813
00:42:37,387 --> 00:42:38,856
but she's tough like
her old man, you know?

814
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,160
I guess you sticking
around makes sense, too.

815
00:42:44,193 --> 00:42:46,128
I wouldn't want to leave the
carefree college days neither,

816
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:48,030
you know?

817

Not really like that.

studying abroad or partying,

I was usually just
driving the bus,

820
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:58,108

He won't even miss it.

He said it was cool, man.

916
00:47:24,106 --> 00:47:25,442
All right.

917
00:47:25,474 --> 00:47:26,375
He know I'm here?

918
00:47:26,409 --> 00:47:27,244
Yeah.

919
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:32,282
What the fuck was that?

920
00:47:32,315 --> 00:47:33,250
Argh.

921
00:47:33,282 --> 00:47:34,217
College kids.

922
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:37,554
They do this all the time.

923
00:47:37,586 --> 00:47:39,056
MICHAEL: Oh, shit.

924
00:47:43,492 --> 00:47:46,028
Pineapple, what the
hell is this shit?

925
00:47:46,061 --> 00:47:48,664
Argh.

926
00:47:48,697 --> 00:47:50,067
God damn nerds.

927
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:56,539
Yeah, it's right here.

928
00:48:00,175 --> 00:48:03,078
Check out her special lot.

929
00:48:03,112 --> 00:48:04,447
God damn it.

930
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,447
Come on.

931
00:48:05,481 --> 00:48:06,416
Jesus.

932
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:09,351
Son of a b...

933
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:10,420
Oh, hey.

934
00:48:10,452 --> 00:48:11,454
Come on in.

935
00:48:11,487 --> 00:48:12,456
Just threw in some bagel bites.

936
00:48:19,027 --> 00:48:20,462
So how you been, man?

937
00:48:20,496 --> 00:48:22,331
Pretty much incredible.

938
00:48:22,364 --> 00:48:24,700
Like, making bank nonstop
without even really

939
00:48:24,733 --> 00:48:26,936
trying, which is awesome.

940
00:48:26,969 --> 00:48:28,337
How about you, hot topic?

941
00:48:28,371 --> 00:48:32,142
Still, uh, living without
regret, or not so much?

942
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,711
What's up with sugar smacks?

943
00:48:34,744 --> 00:48:36,112
Ah, man.

944
00:48:36,144 --> 00:48:37,380
He's cool.
He's with me.

945
00:48:37,413 --> 00:48:38,648
If you say so.

946
00:48:38,681 --> 00:48:40,317
I like your, uh, your place.

947
00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:41,217
It's cool.

948
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:42,152
Yeah.

949
00:48:42,184 --> 00:48:43,353
It's pretty cool.

950
00:48:43,385 --> 00:48:45,255
What do you, um...

951
00:48:45,288 --> 00:48:47,523
what do you do with
all this stuff usually?

952
00:48:47,556 --> 00:48:50,326
eBay mostly on the deep web.

953
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,260
Yeah.

954
00:48:51,293 --> 00:48:52,161
You name it.

955
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:53,163
Devo Ted has got it.

956
00:48:53,195 --> 00:48:54,163
Yeah.

957
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:55,597
You want illegal fireworks?

958
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,433
I could take down Key Tower
with what I'm packing.

959
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:58,367
Laffy taffy?

960
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,002
Turkey jerky?

961
00:49:00,036 --> 00:49:02,304
I could choke out a bear
with what I got up in here.

962
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:03,506
Energizing body wash?

963
00:49:03,539 --> 00:49:05,475
You won't sleep
for weeks, bitch.

964
00:49:08,677 --> 00:49:10,612
What is, what's this thing?

965
00:49:10,646 --> 00:49:12,615
Oh, that is the Flinger.

966
00:49:12,648 --> 00:49:14,451
It's a three-man water
balloon launcher.

967
00:49:14,483 --> 00:49:16,119
We used to mount
one to the window

968
00:49:16,152 --> 00:49:19,188
and launch canned hams
at my mom's boyfriends.

969
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:20,690
The sound they made when
they hit the pavement

970
00:49:20,722 --> 00:49:23,092
was like a Hollywood punch.

971
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,127
No way.

972
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:25,494
You calling me a liar?

973
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:35,038
Dime bad, right?

974
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:38,040
PINEAPPLE: Yeah, man.

975
00:49:38,074 --> 00:49:42,112
What's... what's "Dev-o?"

976
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:43,679
"Dee-vo."

977
00:49:43,713 --> 00:49:45,448
Devo Ted.

978
00:49:45,481 --> 00:49:48,718
Devo, the seminal art punk
band that began one town over.

979
00:49:48,751 --> 00:49:49,753
That... that one.

980
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:51,054
That's who you're talking about?

981
00:49:51,086 --> 00:49:52,489
Ring a bell?

982
00:49:52,521 --> 00:49:55,357
Oh, oh, I saw the thing
with the... the... the flower

983
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:56,760
pots on their head.

984
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:57,660
Dude.

985
00:49:57,693 --> 00:49:59,062
I'm sorry.

986
00:49:59,094 --> 00:50:00,696
Devo fans hate it
when you only know

987
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:02,398
them from the "Whip It" video.

988
00:50:02,431 --> 00:50:04,033
I will fucking stab you.

989
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,335
Yo.

990
00:50:05,367 --> 00:50:07,202
Then you can forget
about the bagel bites.

991
00:50:07,235 --> 00:50:08,137
Dude.

992
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:09,239
We're going to bounce.

993
00:50:09,271 --> 00:50:10,472
Thanks, man.

994
00:50:10,505 --> 00:50:12,474
Wait, whoa, whoa,
ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

995
00:50:12,507 --> 00:50:15,310
Slow down, Tokyo Drift.

996
00:50:15,344 --> 00:50:16,579
Cop a squat.

997
00:50:16,612 --> 00:50:17,514
Sit a spell.

998
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:18,681
Oh.

999
00:50:18,713 --> 00:50:19,648
No, thanks.

1000
00:50:19,681 --> 00:50:20,682
We've gotta go.

1001
00:50:20,715 --> 00:50:21,585
We have an, we have an early.

1002
00:50:31,226 --> 00:50:36,766
Not to shit on your
generation, but your generation

1003
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:39,302
basically sucks ass.

1004
00:50:39,335 --> 00:50:42,172
It's like a bunch of zombies
staring at their video games

1005
00:50:42,204 --> 00:50:43,405
or into their phones.
Hang on.

1006
00:50:43,438 --> 00:50:44,440
I got a text message.

1007
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:46,409
I think it's Karen.

1008
00:50:46,442 --> 00:50:50,280
We got doodads and
widgets of the wing wang.

1009
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:53,083
We've devolved as a species.

1010
00:50:53,115 --> 00:50:57,820
That was Devo's whole
message, de-evolution.

1011
00:50:57,853 --> 00:51:00,189
Their message is more
relevant today than ever.

1012
00:51:00,222 --> 00:51:01,791
I mean, think about it.

1013
00:51:01,824 --> 00:51:03,559
They go out on "Saturday Night
Live," and they're just like,

1014
00:51:03,592 --> 00:51:05,861
wake the fuck up America.

1015
00:51:05,894 --> 00:51:08,331
That was their whole thing.

1016
00:51:08,364 --> 00:51:10,300
Freedom of choice.

1017
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,601
That's what we got.

1018
00:51:11,634 --> 00:51:13,369
I mean, look at this fucker.

1019
00:51:13,402 --> 00:51:16,106
Are you kidding me?

1020
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:19,742
I just realized your, your
hand, your hand tattoos.

1021
00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:21,277
That's clever.

1022
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:22,813
The fuck is Celine Dion
talking about over here?

1023
00:51:25,614 --> 00:51:26,882
You don't?

1024
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:29,219
Are you serious?

1025
00:51:29,251 --> 00:51:30,853
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1026
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:37,560
Look.

1027
00:51:37,592 --> 00:51:38,795
Put your hands together, dude.

1028
00:51:38,827 --> 00:51:41,331
Devo Ted.

1029
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:42,331
Devoted.

1030
00:51:42,364 --> 00:51:49,805
Holy... Devoted.

1031
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:51,141
How incredible is that?

1032
00:51:51,173 --> 00:51:52,574
You've got to see
what my knuckles

1033
00:51:52,608 --> 00:51:55,778
said, hiding in plain sight.

1034
00:51:55,811 --> 00:51:58,780
You don't get stuff
like my new friend.

1035
00:51:58,813 --> 00:52:01,384
Oh, God.

1036
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:05,487
That's cool.

1037
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:06,356
No idea.

1038
00:52:18,733 --> 00:52:20,269
He's out.

1039
00:52:20,302 --> 00:52:23,239
Let's go.

1040
00:52:23,271 --> 00:52:24,641
Grab it.

1041
00:52:24,673 --> 00:52:26,608
I'll be right back.

1042
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:28,210
Wait.

1043
00:52:28,244 --> 00:52:30,579
That's his bedroom.

1044
00:52:30,612 --> 00:52:31,947
What, no!

1045
00:52:31,981 --> 00:52:33,416
Pineapple!

1046
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:36,186
He has a lot of cameras
and stuff in here.

1047
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:36,920
He won't even miss it.

1048
00:52:39,688 --> 00:52:40,489
Jackpot.

1049
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:43,894
Let's go.

1050
00:52:50,932 --> 00:52:52,367
Hurry up.
It's freezing.

1051
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,268
MICHAEL: I got it.

1052
00:52:53,302 --> 00:52:54,704
I got it.

1053
00:52:54,737 --> 00:52:57,407
Spiral!

1054
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,208
How loud is this gonna be?

1055
00:53:02,577 --> 00:53:03,547
That's so loud.

1056
00:53:07,016 --> 00:53:09,686
This is awesome.

1057
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:10,920
Thank you, Devo Ted.

1058
00:53:10,952 --> 00:53:13,590
Thanks, Devo Ted.

1059
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:14,691
We love you.

1061
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:17,961
Devo Ted.

1062
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:20,430
De...

1063
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:21,364
Hi, ma.

1064
00:53:21,396 --> 00:53:22,599
Hey.

1065
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,800
[non-english speech]
There's something

1066
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:26,501
that I want to tell you, right?

1067
00:53:26,534 --> 00:53:32,007
Um, as much as I love you,
and I respect your opinions,

1068
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:35,411
I also know how, judgemental
you can be, and...

1069
00:53:35,443 --> 00:53:36,913
God, I don't know
how to say this.

1070
00:53:36,945 --> 00:53:38,413
Um, I just... what the fuck?

1071
00:53:38,447 --> 00:53:39,349
Dude.

1072
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,617
Your son's a homo.

1073
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:41,550
Yeah.

1074
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:43,385
Homo.

1075
00:53:43,418 --> 00:53:46,521
Oh, you knew?

1076
00:53:46,554 --> 00:53:49,024
Yeah, this is Pineapple.

1077
00:53:49,057 --> 00:53:50,960
Yeah, that's my name.

1078
00:53:50,992 --> 00:53:51,827
Just like the fruit.

1079
00:53:53,862 --> 00:53:54,864
Yeah.

1080
00:53:54,896 --> 00:53:55,831
Justin's gonna be OK, you know?

1081
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:03,940
[non-english speech]

1082
00:54:09,545 --> 00:54:11,380
What did you say to them?

1083
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,049
Your parents are rad.

1084
00:54:13,081 --> 00:54:14,817
We got a lunch date next week.

1085
00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:16,518
Well, you have to come out
to celebrate with us tonight.

1086
00:54:16,552 --> 00:54:17,954
Oh, yeah.

1087
00:54:17,987 --> 00:54:19,055
It's our friend Eric's
birthday, or his roommate's.

1088
00:54:19,088 --> 00:54:20,456
I don't remember.

1089
00:54:20,489 --> 00:54:21,590
Either way, the point
is it's a party.

1090
00:54:21,623 --> 00:54:22,924
And this bitch
is getting crunk.

1091
00:54:22,958 --> 00:54:24,726
Woo.

1092
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,462
Got to work, sorry.

1093
00:54:26,494 --> 00:54:27,797
Oh, you suck.

1094
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:30,365
Let me know if you guys
need a ride later on.

1095
00:54:30,398 --> 00:54:32,301
Go to the party.

1096
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:33,936
What about the bus?

1097
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:35,070
- I'll handle the bus.
- All right.

1098
00:54:35,103 --> 00:54:35,971
Tick-tock, ladies.

1099
00:54:36,005 --> 00:54:37,539
Go ahead without me.

1100
00:54:37,572 --> 00:54:38,974
- I'll catch up.
- OK.

1101
00:54:39,007 --> 00:54:40,475
Bye.

1102
00:54:40,509 --> 00:54:42,778
If Fred finds out,
I'm gonna lose my job.

1103
00:54:42,811 --> 00:54:44,614
Who the fuck cares?

1104
00:54:44,646 --> 00:54:45,547
I care.

1105
00:54:45,581 --> 00:54:47,517
Do you?

1106
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,818
Do you really care if you
lose this lame ass job?

1107
00:54:49,851 --> 00:54:51,019
All right.
You know what?

1108
00:54:51,052 --> 00:54:52,020
Actually, I'm going to run.

1109
00:54:52,054 --> 00:54:52,889
I'll see you.

1110
00:54:56,925 --> 00:55:00,395
Bitch.

1111
00:55:00,429 --> 00:55:01,331
Fine.

1112
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,035
You sure you can
handle her on your own?

1113
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:09,539
[chuckling]

1114
00:55:11,606 --> 00:55:12,509
Kat, wait up.

1115
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:18,448
[phone rings]

1116
00:55:22,885 --> 00:55:25,355
So how's your, uh, how's
your museum project going?

1117
00:55:25,387 --> 00:55:27,123
It's all right.

1118
00:55:27,155 --> 00:55:29,092
It'll come together,
or it won't.

1119
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,992
I don't know.

1120
00:55:31,025 --> 00:55:34,096
Either way, I just, I
don't wanna think about it.

1121
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,731
Sorry.
Am I keeping you up?

1122
00:55:35,764 --> 00:55:36,766
Uh, no.

1123
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:38,668
No, sorry, uh, Night Tara is.

1124
00:55:38,701 --> 00:55:39,635
Ha.

1125
00:55:39,668 --> 00:55:40,737
She was brutal last night.

1126
00:55:45,007 --> 00:55:46,476
How do you do that?

1127
00:56:10,965 --> 00:56:12,101
[laughing]

1128
00:56:13,101 --> 00:56:14,069
Of course.

1129
00:56:14,103 --> 00:56:14,938
Of course.

1130
00:56:21,543 --> 00:56:22,778
Hey, hey.

1131
00:56:22,811 --> 00:56:24,746
Drunk bus.

1132
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,884
Someone get this guy a beer.

1133
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:30,652
Do you know these people?

1134
00:56:30,686 --> 00:56:33,423
Your boyfriend,
he saved my life.

1135
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:37,160
Probably just doing
my, my job or whatever.

1136
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:38,428
Hey, hey.

1137
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,161
You made it.

1138
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:40,062
Wait.

1139
00:56:40,094 --> 00:56:40,996
Who's driving the bus?

1140
00:57:06,054 --> 00:57:07,556
ALL: (CHEERING) Drunk bus!

1141
00:57:22,637 --> 00:57:24,606
Great shot, kid.

1142
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:25,607
One in a million.

1143
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:26,809
Two people who love Star Wars.

1144
00:57:26,842 --> 00:57:27,844
What are the odds?

1145
00:57:27,876 --> 00:57:29,679
BOTH: Never tell me the odds.

1146
00:57:29,711 --> 00:57:31,980
ALL: (SINGING) Happy birthday...

1147
00:57:32,014 --> 00:57:34,182
I forgot this was
a birthday thing.

1148
00:57:34,215 --> 00:57:35,550
Me too.

1149
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:39,621
ALL: (SINGING) Happy
birthday to you.

1150
00:57:39,655 --> 00:57:45,194
Happy birthday dear Todd.

1151
00:57:45,226 --> 00:57:51,067
Happy birthday to you.

1152
00:57:51,099 --> 00:57:53,702
You're all the friends
I never fucking wanted.

1153
00:57:53,735 --> 00:57:54,636
I mean that.

1154
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,873
Now let's get fucked up!

1155
00:57:56,905 --> 00:57:59,775
[cheering]

1156
00:58:20,195 --> 00:58:22,798
What the fuck are you
doing here, bus bitch?

1157
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:30,573
Ow!

1158
00:58:30,606 --> 00:58:31,741
Ow!
Fuck!

1159
00:58:31,773 --> 00:58:32,674
Ow!

1160
00:58:32,708 --> 00:58:34,309
My fucking nose.

1161
00:58:34,342 --> 00:58:35,545
It hurts so bad.

1162
00:58:35,577 --> 00:58:36,579
Yo.

1163
00:58:36,612 --> 00:58:37,313
What did you do to my boy, Todd?

1164
00:58:37,346 --> 00:58:39,014
My fucking nose.

1165
00:58:39,047 --> 00:58:40,115
My f... Ow!

1166
00:58:40,148 --> 00:58:40,983
Fuck!

1167
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,322
Pick me up.

1168
00:58:47,356 --> 00:58:49,191
Fucking bitch.

1169
00:58:49,224 --> 00:58:50,726
Get me out.

1170
00:58:50,759 --> 00:58:53,829
Get me outta here Take
me fucking outta here.

1171
00:58:53,862 --> 00:58:55,764
Get me the fuck outta here.

1172
00:59:14,248 --> 00:59:17,119
[bus hooting]

1173
00:59:29,764 --> 00:59:31,766
How'd you figure
out the marquee?

1174
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,704
I've got mad skills, homie.

1175
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:35,771
Holy shit.

1176
00:59:35,804 --> 00:59:36,939
What happened to your face?

1177
00:59:36,972 --> 00:59:39,775
I ran into Todd with my head.

1178
00:59:39,807 --> 00:59:41,577
Oh, awesome.

1179
00:59:44,246 --> 00:59:47,148
So how was it, killer?

1180
00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:48,850
It fucking hurts.

1181
00:59:48,884 --> 00:59:51,253
It hurts so bad.

1182
00:59:51,286 --> 00:59:52,855
How do you do that?

1183
00:59:52,887 --> 00:59:54,690
You're supposed to use
your head, not your face.

1184
00:59:54,722 --> 00:59:55,724
I broke his nose.

1185
00:59:55,757 --> 00:59:56,625
Oh.

1186
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:57,393
Fuck yeah.

1187
00:59:57,425 --> 00:59:58,960
Ah, come on, dude.

1188
00:59:58,994 --> 01:00:01,931
Fuck chop nothing
to fuck with.

1189
01:00:01,963 --> 01:00:05,400
Kat got all freaked out.

1190
01:00:05,434 --> 01:00:06,902
Everyone else got
all freaked out.

1191
01:00:06,934 --> 01:00:08,938
It was awful.

1192
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:10,206
Ah.

1193
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:12,675
Don't worry about that, man.

1194
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:14,677
At least you'll have a
kickass story about that scar.

1195
01:00:20,114 --> 01:00:21,850
You're going to need
stitches, homie.

1196
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:24,186
I'd do it myself, but I
ain't got anything on me.

1197
01:00:24,219 --> 01:00:25,954
Hey.

1198
01:00:25,987 --> 01:00:30,158
Totally interrupting, um, I
could do you back in my place.

1199
01:00:30,192 --> 01:00:31,092
Uh, sorry.

1200
01:00:31,126 --> 01:00:33,429
[inaudible]

1201
01:00:33,461 --> 01:00:36,065
I'm a nursing major,
so I could stitch

1202
01:00:36,097 --> 01:00:37,766
you up if you want skip the ER.

1203
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,735
No, I'm good, thanks.

1204
01:00:39,768 --> 01:00:41,670
Cool.

1205
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:43,839
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

1206
01:00:43,871 --> 01:00:44,773
Shh.

1207
01:00:44,806 --> 01:00:45,907
Dude.

1208
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:47,108
I just want this
night to be over.

1209
01:00:47,141 --> 01:00:48,143
Do you want to be
a virgin forever?

1210
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:49,045
Shh.

1211
01:00:49,077 --> 01:00:50,211
Come on.

1212
01:00:50,244 --> 01:00:51,713
Shh.

1213
01:00:51,746 --> 01:00:53,014
I don't even know this girl.

1214
01:00:53,047 --> 01:00:54,716
She doesn't really seem
like my type either.

1215
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,318
Virgins don't have types.

1216
01:00:57,351 --> 01:01:00,288
Now, listen, you're going
to go back with that girl.

1217
01:01:00,322 --> 01:01:03,459
She's going to stitch
your face, and then she's

1218
01:01:03,492 --> 01:01:06,896
going to sit on your face.

1219
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:09,197
And listen, when
you're doing it,

1220
01:01:09,231 --> 01:01:10,800
focus on something in
the room, all right?

1221
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,768
You don't want to blow
your wad too soon.

1222
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,802
Hey.

1223
01:01:13,835 --> 01:01:15,704
Seriously, let me look at that.

1224
01:01:15,737 --> 01:01:16,338
Come here.

1225
01:01:22,411 --> 01:01:23,311
What'd you do?

1226
01:01:26,481 --> 01:01:27,349
See.

1227
01:01:27,382 --> 01:01:29,251
It's not so bad, right?

1228
01:01:29,284 --> 01:01:31,921
Imagine how good I'd be if
I didn't have any beers.

1229
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:32,855
What?

1230
01:01:32,887 --> 01:01:33,788
I'm joking.

1231
01:01:33,822 --> 01:01:35,458
I only had four.

1232
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:39,394
Oh, right.

1233
01:01:39,427 --> 01:01:42,498
So you like Sister Oblivion?

1234
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,467
Yeah.

1235
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,168
Hank's my fave.

1236
01:01:46,201 --> 01:01:48,369
I used to be into
crap like that?

1237
01:01:48,402 --> 01:01:49,838
Yeah?

1238
01:01:49,871 --> 01:01:51,339
Like what?

1239
01:01:51,373 --> 01:01:54,342
Photography, sort of.

1240
01:01:54,376 --> 01:01:55,277
Cool.

1241
01:01:55,309 --> 01:01:56,445
What kind?

1242
01:01:56,478 --> 01:01:59,181
Just Polaroids, but
my camera broke.

1243
01:01:59,213 --> 01:02:01,083
I never fixed it.

1244
01:02:01,115 --> 01:02:03,018
Why not?

1245
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:04,353
Oh.

1246
01:02:04,385 --> 01:02:05,820
I don't know.

1247
01:02:05,853 --> 01:02:06,955
I don't why.

1248
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:08,289
I just didn't feel
like doing it...

1249
01:02:08,322 --> 01:02:10,291
Sounds like you're depressed.

1250
01:02:10,324 --> 01:02:11,760
Ow.
Ow.

1251
01:02:11,793 --> 01:02:12,193
Oh.
Sorry.

1252
01:02:12,226 --> 01:02:14,797
Sorry.

1253
01:02:14,829 --> 01:02:18,099
I don't feel depressed really.

1254
01:02:18,132 --> 01:02:19,400
None?

1255
01:02:19,434 --> 01:02:20,836
Yeah.

1256
01:02:20,869 --> 01:02:21,836
Oh.

1257
01:02:21,869 --> 01:02:23,204
Good?

1258
01:02:23,237 --> 01:02:24,740
All better.

1259
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:46,795
All right, so I'm on the
pill, but I won't be offended

1260
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,230
if you use a condom, OK?

1261
01:02:48,262 --> 01:02:49,766
Oh, um, OK.

1262
01:02:57,438 --> 01:02:58,373
You cold?

1263
01:02:58,407 --> 01:02:59,307
What?

1264
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:00,509
No.

1265
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:01,442
Why?

1266
01:03:01,476 --> 01:03:03,979
'Cause you're shaking.

1267
01:03:04,012 --> 01:03:04,914
So good.

1268
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:05,548
OK.

1269
01:03:17,425 --> 01:03:19,295
Did you just come?

1270
01:03:24,398 --> 01:03:27,068
I, I'm so, I'm, I'm so sorry.

1271
01:03:27,101 --> 01:03:28,403
It's OK.

1272
01:03:28,436 --> 01:03:31,873
Just finger bang me, and
we can try again later.

1273
01:03:31,907 --> 01:03:32,975
Oh, OK.

1274
01:03:38,313 --> 01:03:40,015
- Li... like that?
- Yeah, but shh.

1275
01:03:40,047 --> 01:03:40,982
Shut up.

1276
01:03:41,016 --> 01:03:41,983
Sorry.

1277
01:03:42,016 --> 01:03:44,953
Shh.

1278
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:48,224
[snoring]

1279
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:04,505
I want you inside me.

1280
01:04:04,539 --> 01:04:05,441
What?

1281
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:09,412
Are you OK?

1282
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:19,454
PINEAPPLE: Remember to focus
on something in the room, yo.

1283
01:04:27,061 --> 01:04:30,632
Fornicate this woman.

1284
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:33,903
She needs you.

1285
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:36,438
Yeah.

1286
01:04:36,471 --> 01:04:37,373
Yeah.

1287
01:04:37,405 --> 01:04:38,273
This feels great.

1288
01:04:38,306 --> 01:04:39,641
That feels so good.

1289
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:40,576
Yeah.

1290
01:04:40,608 --> 01:04:41,911
That feels so good.

1291
01:04:41,943 --> 01:04:43,112
Too much.

1292
01:04:43,144 --> 01:04:44,246
Too much, no.

1293
01:04:52,487 --> 01:04:56,125
Are you OK?

1294
01:04:56,157 --> 01:04:57,125
Yeah.

1295
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:58,027
What?

1296
01:04:58,059 --> 01:05:00,429
Do it just like that.

1297
01:05:00,461 --> 01:05:02,398
KAT: (KNOCKING) Shut up!

1298
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:05,266
Tell them to fuck off.

1299
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,568
Fuck off.

1300
01:05:06,601 --> 01:05:07,436
Yeah.

1301
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:13,075
Why are you doing this to me?

1302
01:05:13,108 --> 01:05:15,044
Say my name.

1303
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,078
Say my name.

1304
01:05:24,418 --> 01:05:25,554
KAT: Tara.

1305
01:05:25,586 --> 01:05:26,554
Shut the fuck up.

1306
01:05:26,588 --> 01:05:28,157
I'm trying to sleep.

1307
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,557
Tara?

1308
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:31,527
She's Night... she's Night...

1309
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:32,460
Night Tara?

1310
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:57,353
You're an asshole.

1311
01:06:05,659 --> 01:06:06,627
Sorry.

1312
01:06:06,661 --> 01:06:07,628
Didn't mean to wake you.

1313
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:11,166
[screaming and yelling]

1314
01:07:38,519 --> 01:07:39,487
Coming.

1315
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:40,489
My God.

1316
01:07:40,521 --> 01:07:41,423
I'm sick of this.

1317
01:07:44,492 --> 01:07:45,360
Just you?

1318
01:07:45,393 --> 01:07:46,228
Yeah.

1319
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:01,576
Dime bag, right?

1320
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,612
The hell happened to your face?

1321
01:08:03,644 --> 01:08:05,514
You don't wanna know.

1322
01:08:05,547 --> 01:08:07,382
Looks like Pineapple's work.

1323
01:08:07,414 --> 01:08:08,349
Yeah.

1324
01:08:08,382 --> 01:08:11,552
Kind of.

1325
01:08:11,585 --> 01:08:15,623
So whose idea
was the fireworks?

1326
01:08:15,657 --> 01:08:16,891
Yeah.

1327
01:08:16,925 --> 01:08:19,261
I know about that,
you little shit ball.

1328
01:08:19,293 --> 01:08:20,761
It was Pine's idea, wasn't it?

1329
01:08:20,795 --> 01:08:23,532
You can't trust that dude
as far as you can throw him.

1330
01:08:23,564 --> 01:08:25,366
He's probably been telling
you all sorts of shit

1331
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:27,402
about Samoa, too.

1332
01:08:27,435 --> 01:08:28,537
What?

1333
01:08:28,569 --> 01:08:31,439
He's from Buffalo.

1334
01:08:31,472 --> 01:08:33,141
I think one of his
grandparents might

1335
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:37,613
have lived in Samoa or New
Zealand a million years ago.

1336
01:08:37,645 --> 01:08:38,679
What?

1337
01:08:38,712 --> 01:08:39,648
What are you talking about?

1338
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,449
Ask him.

1339
01:08:41,483 --> 01:08:45,287
He didn't get those tattoos in
some ancient island ceremony.

1340
01:08:45,319 --> 01:08:47,588
He got them at
Show Us Your Tats.

1341
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:51,193
It's like the Supercuts
of tattoo parlors.

1342
01:08:51,225 --> 01:08:54,195
I don't even think he's
seen an ocean up close.

1343
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:56,765
Wha... no.

1344
01:08:56,797 --> 01:08:58,466
Why would he lie about that?

1345
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:59,635
Look.

1346
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:02,170
Everyone's got
their reasons, man.

1347
01:09:02,203 --> 01:09:03,938
Looking like he does,
he gets to be special.

1348
01:09:03,971 --> 01:09:07,475
He gets to be Pineapple,
the punk rock Samoan.

1349
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:10,578
When deep down inside, he
knows he'll always basically

1350
01:09:10,612 --> 01:09:13,748
be Greg, the deadbeat
dad, the nursing

1351
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:16,818
school dropout from Buffalo.

1352
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:18,353
No.

1353
01:09:18,386 --> 01:09:20,522
He se... he sends money
to his kid every week.

1354
01:09:20,555 --> 01:09:24,592
Yeah, and I got a
9-foot dingle dangle.

1355
01:09:24,626 --> 01:09:25,561
Here.

1356
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:26,828
It's on our mutual friend.

1357
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,605
Well, I'm going to go.

1358
01:09:36,637 --> 01:09:37,672
Uh, whoa, whoa.

1359
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:38,606
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1360
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:39,541
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

1361
01:09:39,573 --> 01:09:40,576
Ah.

1362
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:42,945
I can make us some bagel bites.

1363
01:09:42,978 --> 01:09:44,813
Bagel bites sound good?

1364
01:09:44,845 --> 01:09:48,316
It's like a small bagel
pizza [inaudible]..

1365
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,818
It's nice.

1366
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:50,751
All right.

1367
01:09:50,784 --> 01:09:51,653
I thought so.

1368
01:09:51,685 --> 01:09:53,889
That's my guy.

1369
01:09:53,921 --> 01:09:56,557
You remind me a lot of
myself when I was your age.

1370
01:09:56,591 --> 01:09:59,328
I didn't always have
my shit together.

1371
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,595
Yeah.

1372
01:10:00,628 --> 01:10:02,997
They'll tell you to
graduate, get a job,

1373
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:08,569
marry within or above your
socioeconomic bracket.

1374
01:10:08,603 --> 01:10:11,440
Next thing you know, you're
saddled with a mortgage,

1375
01:10:11,472 --> 01:10:13,708
and you're passing all this
shit your dad laid on to you

1376
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:16,244
on to your own kid.

1377
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:17,412
The American dream.

1378
01:10:17,444 --> 01:10:20,282
Just add water.

1379
01:10:20,314 --> 01:10:21,716
Oh, fuck the world.

1380
01:10:30,524 --> 01:10:33,862
So how was it last night?

1381
01:10:33,895 --> 01:10:36,398
Oh, it was great.

1382
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:38,933
Woke up in the middle of the
night with her on top of me.

1383
01:10:38,966 --> 01:10:40,469
One minute we're doing
it, the next she's

1384
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:42,804
scratching and flailing
around in my face,

1385
01:10:42,837 --> 01:10:45,340
screaming like a
fucking psycho person.

1386
01:10:45,372 --> 01:10:47,475
Freaky deaky.

1387
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:48,577
Freaky.

1388
01:10:48,609 --> 01:10:49,543
Felony.

1389
01:10:49,577 --> 01:10:50,412
Who's to say?

1390
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:00,421
Bob, will you get on the bus?

1391
01:11:00,454 --> 01:11:02,923
It's freezing.

1392
01:11:02,957 --> 01:11:04,426
Damn.

1393
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:05,860
Dude doesn't give a fuck.

1394
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:09,530
Bob, will you just
get on the bus, please?

1395
01:11:09,564 --> 01:11:11,733
Fuck you.

1396
01:11:11,765 --> 01:11:13,301
You know what?

1397
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:14,869
Fuck you, Bob.

1398
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:16,605
I think this is all an act.

1399
01:11:16,637 --> 01:11:17,905
Do you hear me?

1400
01:11:17,939 --> 01:11:20,809
If I'm wrong, tell me different.

1401
01:11:20,841 --> 01:11:21,809
I'm not buying it anymore.

1402
01:11:21,842 --> 01:11:22,711
Dude.

1403
01:11:22,743 --> 01:11:23,944
Lay off.

1404
01:11:23,978 --> 01:11:24,880
Give him a break.

1405
01:11:24,912 --> 01:11:26,414
No.

1406
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:27,816
You know, I think he's
a fucking liar like you.

1407
01:11:27,849 --> 01:11:28,949
What?

1408
01:11:28,983 --> 01:11:30,485
If I'm wrong,
tell me I'm wrong.

1409
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:42,431
Fuck you.

1410
01:11:45,899 --> 01:11:46,867
You know what?

1411
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,369
I'm done with this guy.

1412
01:12:08,088 --> 01:12:09,957
Yo.

1413
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:11,926
You going to tell me why you
called me a liar or what?

1414
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:17,532
Give me the phone, Pineapple.

1415
01:12:17,564 --> 01:12:19,433
You're texting Amy?

1416
01:12:19,466 --> 01:12:20,469
Come on.

1417
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:21,837
Give me my phone now, please.

1418
01:12:21,869 --> 01:12:22,738
No.

1419
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:25,773
You can't be trusted.

1420
01:12:25,806 --> 01:12:27,943
You want to talk about trust?

1421
01:12:27,975 --> 01:12:29,710
You pressured me to
go to that party,

1422
01:12:29,743 --> 01:12:31,579
which was a complete disaster.

1423
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:33,081
Then you tell me that
I need to get laid,

1424
01:12:33,113 --> 01:12:35,149
which is an even
bigger disaster.

1425
01:12:35,182 --> 01:12:36,984
I didn't hold a
gun to your head.

1426
01:12:37,018 --> 01:12:38,587
God.

1427
01:12:38,619 --> 01:12:40,956
You're just this massive
pile of walking bullshit,

1428
01:12:40,988 --> 01:12:43,391
and you tell me to make
decisions and do things.

1429
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:45,427
You don't fucking do anything.

1430
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:46,595
You could be saving
lives, but you

1431
01:12:46,627 --> 01:12:49,096
just fuck around and get high.

1432
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:51,666
In Samoa, there's a saying.

1433
01:12:51,698 --> 01:12:52,867
[samoan]

1434
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,069
[mocking samoan]
Shut the fuck up.

1435
01:12:55,103 --> 01:12:56,538
- No one cares.
- No.

1436
01:12:56,570 --> 01:12:57,372
You're wrong.

1437
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:03,078
You're not even from Samoa.

1438
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:04,779
You've never even been there.

1439
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:07,047
Who told you that?

1440
01:13:07,081 --> 01:13:08,115
Let me guess.

1441
01:13:08,149 --> 01:13:10,852
It was Devo Ted, wasn't it?

1442
01:13:10,885 --> 01:13:12,788
That mother fucker
is responsible for...

1443
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:13,988
Oh.

1444
01:13:14,021 --> 01:13:15,689
What do you know
about responsibility?

1445
01:13:15,722 --> 01:13:17,958
Plenty.

1446
01:13:17,992 --> 01:13:19,927
That's not what I heard.

1447
01:13:19,961 --> 01:13:23,164
What'd you hear?

1448
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:24,900
Just give me my phone.

1449
01:13:24,932 --> 01:13:27,702
Give me my phone,
and I'll tell you.

1450
01:13:27,734 --> 01:13:30,572
What'd you hear?

1451
01:13:30,604 --> 01:13:31,505
Yo.

1452
01:13:31,538 --> 01:13:32,541
Dick.

1453
01:13:32,573 --> 01:13:33,808
What'd you hear?

1454
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:35,576
That you're a fucking
deadbeat dad, OK?

1455
01:13:39,814 --> 01:13:41,483
What the hell, man?

1456
01:13:41,515 --> 01:13:48,723
What the... Pine, stop.

1457
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:54,796
You want to lecture
me about responsibility?

1458
01:13:54,828 --> 01:13:58,500
Try working two fucking
jobs, living in a shithole

1459
01:13:58,533 --> 01:14:00,101
just so my kid could eat.

1460
01:14:00,134 --> 01:14:04,605
I may not be first generation
Samoan, but I love my daughter!

1461
01:14:04,639 --> 01:14:05,440
OK.

1462
01:14:13,614 --> 01:14:14,782
PINEAPPLE: I don't need this.

1463
01:14:48,015 --> 01:14:49,149
MICHAEL: Look.

1464
01:14:49,182 --> 01:14:50,051
I know about Todd.

1465
01:14:50,083 --> 01:14:51,552
AMY: Who?

1466
01:14:51,586 --> 01:14:55,023
MICHAEL: The guy that
you had sex with.

1467
01:14:55,055 --> 01:14:57,192
Is he a Ginger?

1468
01:14:57,225 --> 01:14:58,126
Yes.

1469
01:14:58,158 --> 01:14:59,728
OK.

1470
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:01,930
So we, we talked once at
a party after we broke up,

1471
01:15:01,962 --> 01:15:03,697
but that was it.

1472
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:05,800
You seriously think I would
lose my virginity to a stranger?

1473
01:15:09,737 --> 01:15:10,639
Look.

1474
01:15:10,671 --> 01:15:13,974
I... I felt so bad.

1475
01:15:14,007 --> 01:15:17,878
I... I feel so bad about
what happened with us.

1476
01:15:17,912 --> 01:15:20,115
Michael, I knew you were never
going to move to New York.

1477
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:21,716
You never asked me.

1478
01:15:21,748 --> 01:15:22,650
Come on.

1479
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:24,753
Be real.

1480
01:15:24,786 --> 01:15:26,621
You're terrified of the
unknown, and you can't make

1481
01:15:26,654 --> 01:15:28,156
a decision to save your life.

1482
01:15:28,189 --> 01:15:30,225
That's not true.

1483
01:15:30,257 --> 01:15:33,060
Uh, when you texted
me back, how long did it

1484
01:15:33,094 --> 01:15:36,765
take you to actually hit send?

1485
01:15:36,797 --> 01:15:39,233
It's who you are, and that's OK.

1486
01:15:39,266 --> 01:15:40,268
You would have hated New York.

1487
01:15:40,301 --> 01:15:42,637
It's not for everyone.

1488
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:43,771
Not even me.

1489
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:45,574
I thought you loved it there.

1490
01:15:45,606 --> 01:15:48,009
I did.

1491
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:54,950
I did, but everyone and
everything moves so fast,

1492
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:56,650
and I missed home.

1493
01:15:56,684 --> 01:15:58,587
And I missed you.

1494
01:16:02,055 --> 01:16:03,924
And I got fired.

1495
01:16:03,957 --> 01:16:04,960
Yeah.

1496
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:07,162
I didn't want anyone to know.

1497
01:16:07,194 --> 01:16:10,064
It's been a rough couple
of months actually.

1498
01:16:10,097 --> 01:16:15,136
So with my tail tucked between
my legs, I am moving back.

1499
01:16:18,706 --> 01:16:20,141
So I've got a
couple of job leads,

1500
01:16:20,173 --> 01:16:21,376
and my parents
are going to float

1501
01:16:21,408 --> 01:16:22,710
me till I get back on my feet.

1502
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:27,916
Are you going to make me say it?

1503
01:16:27,948 --> 01:16:30,951
Say what?

1504
01:16:30,984 --> 01:16:36,390
I was hoping we could
pick up where we left off.

1505
01:16:36,423 --> 01:16:39,894
Where we left off was
you breaking my heart

1506
01:16:39,926 --> 01:16:41,328
and fucking another guy.

1507
01:16:41,362 --> 01:16:45,233
I just said that
that wasn't true.

1508
01:16:45,265 --> 01:16:48,168
I'm serious about
setting down roots.

1509
01:16:48,202 --> 01:16:50,606
You know, here with you.

1510
01:16:55,076 --> 01:16:57,811
And I've given it
a lot of thought,

1511
01:16:57,845 --> 01:17:00,615
and I think we should have sex.

1512
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:05,686
Not, not like now.

1513
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,421
I know.

1514
01:17:06,453 --> 01:17:07,721
But yeah.

1515
01:17:07,755 --> 01:17:09,757
Soon.

1516
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:14,095
I can be at the Student
Center tomorrow around 11:30.

1517
01:17:14,127 --> 01:17:16,398
If you want some
company on the loop.

1518
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:19,366
I can bring an overnight bag.

1519
01:17:19,399 --> 01:17:21,869
Oh.

1520
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:26,274
What about, like,
the... the... the Lord?

1521
01:17:26,306 --> 01:17:27,207
Oh.

1522
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,342
Yeah.

1523
01:17:28,376 --> 01:17:30,412
I've, I've thought
about that too.

1524
01:17:30,444 --> 01:17:34,682
I think He would prefer that we
do it than with some strangers.

1525
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:36,218
Especially, you know,
since we're back together.

1526
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:41,390
Are we back together?

1527
01:18:05,512 --> 01:18:07,849
FRED (ON RADIO): Hey,
you sitting down?

1528
01:18:07,881 --> 01:18:08,750
Yeah.

1529
01:18:08,783 --> 01:18:10,485
I'm driving.

1530
01:18:10,518 --> 01:18:12,886
FRED (ON RADIO): I
just got some bad news.

1531
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,855
You're sitting, right?

1532
01:18:14,889 --> 01:18:17,958
Fred, I'm really
not in the mood.

1533
01:18:17,992 --> 01:18:19,994
FRED (ON RADIO): Fuck You Bob.

1534
01:18:20,027 --> 01:18:22,297
He died last night.

1535
01:18:22,329 --> 01:18:24,231
They found the poor
guy frozen to death

1536
01:18:24,265 --> 01:18:27,235
like a bearded Popsicle
on the side of the road.

1537
01:18:27,268 --> 01:18:30,270
The battery in his
wheelchair must've gave out.

1538
01:18:30,304 --> 01:18:32,740
Guy had no family.

1539
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:35,243
It's a real shame.

1540
01:18:35,275 --> 01:18:36,377
Circle of life, I suppose.

1541
01:18:46,052 --> 01:18:49,157
Everyone, get off the bus.

1542
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:50,157
Get off the bus now.

1543
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:51,091
I'm not kidding.

1544
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:53,427
Get off my bus.

1545
01:18:53,461 --> 01:18:54,496
Sorry, yeah.

1546
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:56,164
Get off the bus.

1547
01:18:56,197 --> 01:18:57,298
This god damn kid.

1548
01:19:01,868 --> 01:19:02,804
Ah!

1549
01:19:02,837 --> 01:19:04,106
Get off the bus!

1550
01:19:07,908 --> 01:19:08,777
What are you?

1551
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:09,511
A zombie?

1552
01:19:09,543 --> 01:19:12,479
Get off the fucking bus!

1553
01:19:12,512 --> 01:19:14,181
Are you on or off?

1554
01:19:14,215 --> 01:19:18,119
I want to see
how this plays out.

1555
01:19:18,152 --> 01:19:18,953
Where are we?

1556
01:19:40,841 --> 01:19:41,509
Damn it!

1557
01:19:44,612 --> 01:19:47,382
Why would I leave him
out there like that?

1558
01:19:47,414 --> 01:19:48,884
I'm so stupid.

1559
01:19:53,287 --> 01:19:55,390
Uh, this is all my fault.

1560
01:19:55,422 --> 01:19:58,492
You're giving yourself
way too much credit.

1561
01:19:58,525 --> 01:20:00,028
Dude was old as fuck.

1562
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:01,195
This is not a joke.

1563
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:02,497
I'm talking about
someone's life.

1564
01:20:02,529 --> 01:20:03,398
Yeah.

1565
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:04,364
It was his choice.

1566
01:20:04,398 --> 01:20:05,600
He decided that.

1567
01:20:05,632 --> 01:20:07,202
Now what the fuck
are we doing here?

1568
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:11,972
I don't know.

1569
01:20:12,006 --> 01:20:14,209
I just... I...

1570
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:17,512
I know nothing about
the guy, and now...

1571
01:20:17,545 --> 01:20:18,846
and now he's dead because of me.

1572
01:20:21,582 --> 01:20:24,018
Look.

1573
01:20:24,051 --> 01:20:28,189
Maybe Fuck You Bob was Fuck You
Bob just to get through life.

1574
01:20:28,221 --> 01:20:30,057
You know, some of us lie.

1575
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:32,994
Some of us say fuck
you to everybody.

1576
01:20:33,027 --> 01:20:34,395
Some of us drive
around in circles.

1577
01:20:34,427 --> 01:20:35,262
You feel me?

1578
01:20:39,966 --> 01:20:43,003
All right?

1579
01:20:43,037 --> 01:20:43,905
OK.

1580
01:20:43,938 --> 01:20:44,573
Move.

1581
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,591
Yo, dude.

1582
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:38,426
Come over here.

1583
01:22:02,382 --> 01:22:04,118
Did he do all
this from memory?

1584
01:22:15,529 --> 01:22:19,033
Holy shit.

1585
01:22:19,065 --> 01:22:19,733
Yo.

1586
01:22:19,766 --> 01:22:20,601
Check this out.

1587
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:42,489
Your nipple looks
like a ball sack.

1588
01:22:42,523 --> 01:22:45,092
That's accurate.

1589
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:47,595
Man, Fuck You Bob
was one sick puppy.

1590
01:22:47,627 --> 01:22:50,163
He had a name.

1591
01:22:50,197 --> 01:22:52,100
Robert Birch.

1592
01:22:52,132 --> 01:22:55,269
I like Fuck You Bob better.

1593
01:22:55,301 --> 01:22:57,572
Man, I wonder what's going
to happen to all of these.

1594
01:22:57,604 --> 01:22:59,439
He had no family, right?

1595
01:22:59,472 --> 01:23:01,242
I don't know.

1596
01:23:01,274 --> 01:23:06,279
I'm guessing the state of the
school's going to toss it all.

1597
01:23:06,313 --> 01:23:08,016
Man, fuck that.

1598
01:23:10,751 --> 01:23:11,652
Yeah.

1599
01:23:11,685 --> 01:23:12,553
You know what?

1600
01:23:12,586 --> 01:23:13,488
Fuck that.

1601
01:23:24,765 --> 01:23:26,300
Hey, come here.

1602
01:23:26,332 --> 01:23:27,768
Oh, my God.

1603
01:23:27,801 --> 01:23:30,170
What do you want?

1604
01:23:30,203 --> 01:23:31,104
Just come here.

1605
01:23:31,137 --> 01:23:32,707
We're busy.

1606
01:23:32,739 --> 01:23:33,707
What?

1607
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:36,210
I said we're fucking busy.

1608
01:23:36,243 --> 01:23:38,112
Doing what?

1609
01:23:38,145 --> 01:23:39,814
What do you want?

1610
01:23:39,846 --> 01:23:42,149
I got to show you something.

1611
01:23:42,182 --> 01:23:44,519
What is it?

1612
01:23:44,551 --> 01:23:46,353
Just ca... can you come here?

1613
01:23:46,386 --> 01:23:47,387
Can you trust me, please?

1614
01:23:47,421 --> 01:23:48,722
Can you do that?

1615
01:23:48,756 --> 01:23:51,426
You're not gonna smash
our faces in, are you?

1616
01:23:51,458 --> 01:23:53,360
No.

1617
01:23:53,394 --> 01:23:57,298
I promise I will not
smash your faces.

1618
01:23:57,331 --> 01:23:59,167
He shouldn't have to say it.

1619
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:05,840
All right.

1620
01:24:05,872 --> 01:24:07,341
We got nothing
better to do anyway.

1621
01:24:11,345 --> 01:24:14,248
This is...

1622
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:16,216
It's beautiful.

1623
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:17,318
Who did this?

1624
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:18,251
Robert Birch.

1625
01:24:18,284 --> 01:24:19,353
Who?

1626
01:24:19,386 --> 01:24:20,688
Fuck You Bob.

1627
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:21,755
- He died last night.
- Wait.

1628
01:24:21,788 --> 01:24:22,657
Are you serious?

1629
01:24:22,689 --> 01:24:24,391
What?

1630
01:24:24,425 --> 01:24:26,327
We found his place, and we
found all of his paintings.

1631
01:24:26,359 --> 01:24:27,795
He wasn't an ass...

1632
01:24:27,828 --> 01:24:31,099
I mean, he was an asshole,
but he was an artist too.

1633
01:24:31,131 --> 01:24:32,299
What about you?

1634
01:24:32,332 --> 01:24:33,233
What?

1635
01:24:33,266 --> 01:24:34,269
Are you an asshole?

1636
01:24:37,171 --> 01:24:38,806
Nah.

1637
01:24:38,838 --> 01:24:40,274
I see you more as
a douche canoe.

1638
01:24:47,581 --> 01:24:49,449
You know what?

1639
01:24:49,483 --> 01:24:50,318
That's it.

1640
01:25:03,697 --> 01:25:05,166
FRED (ON RADIO): Fuck chop.

1641
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:07,268
I'm getting no-show
calls up the corn hole.

1642
01:25:07,301 --> 01:25:10,171
You know, if... if... if what I'm
hearing turns out to be true.

1643
01:25:10,203 --> 01:25:12,706
You can kiss that $25,000
job goodbye, mister.

1644
01:25:12,739 --> 01:25:13,608
Yeah.

1645
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:14,541
Relax.

1646
01:25:14,574 --> 01:25:15,475
I'm on the loop.

1647
01:25:15,509 --> 01:25:16,409
FRED (ON RADIO): Relax?

1648
01:25:16,443 --> 01:25:18,412
You're my protege.

1649
01:25:18,444 --> 01:25:20,881
I've been grooming you
to take over one day.

1650
01:25:20,914 --> 01:25:24,719
Ignite your future, like I did.

1651
01:25:24,752 --> 01:25:27,388
You know, it's not so bad.

1652
01:25:27,421 --> 01:25:29,190
What's not that bad?

1653
01:25:29,222 --> 01:25:30,557
FRED (ON RADIO): This job.

1654
01:25:30,591 --> 01:25:31,692
This town.

1655
01:25:31,725 --> 01:25:33,561
There a lot worse
places to end up

1656
01:25:33,594 --> 01:25:35,630
than running the campus
bus service at Kent

1657
01:25:35,662 --> 01:25:38,398
Institute of Technology.

1658
01:25:38,431 --> 01:25:40,233
But maybe you're right.

1659
01:25:40,266 --> 01:25:42,302
Maybe I've wasted my life.

1660
01:25:42,336 --> 01:25:44,605
I didn't say that.

1661
01:25:44,637 --> 01:25:46,707
FRED (ON RADIO):
You didn't have to.

1662
01:25:46,739 --> 01:25:48,842
I... I... I read subtext.

1663
01:25:48,876 --> 01:25:51,779
Subtext?

1664
01:25:51,811 --> 01:25:54,681
FRED (ON RADIO): Truth is.

1665
01:25:54,715 --> 01:25:58,185
I haven't been happy
in a long time.

1666
01:25:58,219 --> 01:26:04,192
Sometimes, I just wish I could
go to sleep and never wake up.

1667
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:07,428
Fred, what was that noise?

1668
01:26:07,461 --> 01:26:09,597
FRED (ON RADIO): You mean
the cocked Ruger GP 100

1669
01:26:09,630 --> 01:26:12,833
Revolver aimed at my temple?

1670
01:26:12,865 --> 01:26:16,304
Fred, that's not funny.

1671
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:18,239
FRED (ON RADIO):
Fuck chop, thanks

1672
01:26:18,271 --> 01:26:20,675
for giving me the courage
to do what I'm about to do.

1673
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:26,614
Tell my family, I...

1674
01:26:26,646 --> 01:26:28,381
I don't know, just...

1675
01:26:28,414 --> 01:26:29,817
Fred.

1676
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:31,953
FRED (ON RADIO): FRED:
Tell them I wasn't all bad.

1677
01:26:31,985 --> 01:26:33,621
Fred.
FRED (ON RADIO): Tell them.

What the fuck did
you say to him?

1681
01:26:38,292 --> 01:26:39,460
I don't know.

1682
01:26:39,493 --> 01:26:40,528
I didn't, I didn't
tell him anything.

1683
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,896
Fuck.

1684
01:26:42,930 --> 01:26:45,300
FRED (ON RADIO):
Gotcha, ya buttholes.

1685
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:50,771
It was a sound effect
on my computer.

1686
01:26:50,804 --> 01:26:51,672
Here.

1687
01:26:51,704 --> 01:26:52,606

I'm embarrassed for you.

01:26:57,711 --> 01:26:58,713
Ugh.

1691
01:26:58,746 --> 01:26:59,713
Falling for that.

1692
01:26:59,747 --> 01:27:01,414
Game's got to respect game.

1693
01:27:01,448 --> 01:27:02,350
Yeah.

1694
01:27:02,382 --> 01:27:03,350
Fuck that guy.

1695
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:05,819
It was real fucking funny.

1696
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:06,787
FRED (ON RADIO): Ah.

1697
01:27:06,819 --> 01:27:08,222
Absolute buttholes.

1698
01:27:10,823 --> 01:27:11,725
Yeah.

1699
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:12,560
Let's go.

1700

1704

Good shot.

Ah.

1706
01:27:41,555 --> 01:27:42,523
Yeah.

1707
01:27:42,555 --> 01:27:45,659

Get the ham.

That's nasty.

01:27:55,903 --> 01:27:56,936
OK.

Oh my God.

Huh?
What?

1721

Oh, we're pretending
to kiss for our friends.

How much longer do you
think we have to do this for?

1731
01:28:46,019 --> 01:28:47,822
Um, it's kind of
like 10 seconds.

1732
01:28:47,854 --> 01:28:50,056
You sure?

1733
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:51,926
No, get the fuck away from me.

1734
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:12,012
I haven't done that much damage
since they popped their VP.

Didn't he cry afterward?

1736
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:14,414
Yeah.

1737
01:29:14,448 --> 01:29:15,416

See you guys.

01:29:16,850 --> 01:29:19,453
So if you ever figured
out whether or not you're

1740

Oh, wait.

should have this.

1749
01:29:46,712 --> 01:29:47,581
Yeah.

thing and one thing only.

Hey, Pineapple.

01:30:05,798 --> 01:30:07,868
Was that true what
you told me at juvie?

1756
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:11,572
Uh, cracking out because
of the repetition?

1757
01:30:11,604 --> 01:30:12,472
Yeah, man.

1758
01:30:12,506 --> 01:30:13,841
It was.

01:30:13,873 --> 01:30:18,746
How'd you learn to,
like, live in a time loop?

1760
01:30:18,779 --> 01:30:21,115
I didn't.

1761
01:30:21,148 --> 01:30:23,617
I broke out.
