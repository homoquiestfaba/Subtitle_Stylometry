00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:24,023
<i>When you grow up in a city as big as Miami,
it's easy to feel small.</i>

2
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:29,194
<i>Past all those skyscrapers and palm trees
is my neighborhood,</i>

3
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:33,365
<i>just a few miles from South Beach,
but a world away.</i>

4
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:39,038
<i>And growing up in a place like this,
you learn pretty quick</i>

5
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:43,208
<i>that you have to speak louder than
everyone else if you want to be heard.</i>

6
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:48,422
<i>Because the truth is, everyone has a voice.</i>

7
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:53,343
<i>And there comes a time when you have
to shout, to fight for what you want.</i>

8
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:59,433
<i>For me and my friends, that time is now.</i>

9
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:43,352
<i>I'm telling you, there's a 50-50 chance
we're going to jail tonight.</i>

10
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,187
Maybe.

11
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,923
You ready?

12
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,883
<i>You're Kidding, right?</i>

13
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,922
Yo, guys. Check it out.

14
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,636
There we go.

15
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,846
How sick is that?

16
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,139
<i>Come on. We're gonna be late.</i>

17
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:53,602
<i>We're not paying you to do
whatever it is you're doing.</i>

18
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,270
<i>-We'll be right there.
-You better be.</i>

19
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,398
The new manager is out there
with a freaking white glove.

20
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,361
What up, guys?

21
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,656
Check it out.

22
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,702
<i>Topping our local headlines,
Ocean Drive was transformed today</i>

23
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:15,123
<i>into what some are describing as art,
others a public disturbance.</i>

24
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,208
<i>One minute everything's normal.</i>

25
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,710
<i>The next, these cars and people
came out of nowhere...</i>

26
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,339
<i>I actually hope the police find them
and lock their... asses up.</i>

27
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:26,009
<i>It was one of the most amazing things
I've ever seen.</i>

28
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,928
<i>Whoever you guys are, we love you!</i>

29
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,972
I love you, too.

30
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,141
-Yeah, how sick is that?
-Where are my waiters?

31
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,185
<i>I've got a two-top that's been
waiting for 10 minutes.</i>

32
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,771
<i>Two-top? Yeah, that's mine.</i>

33
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,107
Patrons do not wait at the Dimont.

34
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,485
<i>You must be the new manager. I'm Sean.</i>

35
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,782
<i>I'm your boss, not your homie.</i>

36
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,911
<i>Next time you leave customers
waiting like that, you're fired.</i>

37
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,499
<i>Don't worry about it, man.
I'm still your homie.</i>

38
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,503
<i>It's cool. You need to fire him for that shirt.</i>

39
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,505
<i>What do they want?</i>

40
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,758
<i>Love them or hate them,
the question on everyone's mind is,</i>

41
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,718
<i>who is The Mob?</i>

42
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,015
I feel it tonight!

43
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,351
<i>Let's get out of here.
Let's get some drinks, let's get some girls...</i>

44
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,978
Eddy, you see this sign?

45
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,898
What sign?

46
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:30,365
<i>Yo, Miami, Club Euphoria!
Make some noise!</i>

47
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,130
Look at these working stiffs.

48
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,507
<i>What up, big man? What's going on?</i>

49
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,392
Excuse me!

50
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,981
Excuse me! Can I get a drink, please?

51
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,707
Hey. Can I get a beer?

52
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,920
Sure. Why not.

53
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,713
You must be new here.

54
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,048
Sorry, what?

55
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,758
<i>I said, "You must be new here. "</i>

56
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,427
Sort of. Yeah.

57
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,971
-Well, I work here, too.
-Really?

58
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,723
Unfortunately.

59
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,017
<i>Come on. It can't be that bad.</i>

60
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,978
<i>The pay sucks, there's no benefits,
and the clientele treats us like crap.</i>

61
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,439
<i>There's got to be something good
about this place, right?</i>

62
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,108
Well,

63
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,778
there is this really cute waiter.

64
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,530
Really?

65
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,325
Where is he?

66
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,377
<i>You Know what? It's on the house.</i>

67
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,964
Where are you going?

68
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,215
To dance.

69
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,551
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

70
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,010
What are you doing?

71
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,971
<i>I'm escorting a lady to the dance floor.</i>

72
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,264
You dance?

73
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,809
<i>Me? No. Don't you Know how this works?</i>

74
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,145
I hold a drink in my hand, you dance
around me and make me look good.

75
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,648
Okay. Got it.

76
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,900
<i>Let's go make you look good.</i>

77
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,259
So am I making you look good yet?

78
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,095
<i>-That's terrible. Is that all you do?
-No.</i>

79
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,655
Okay. Your turn.

80
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,491
<i>I promise I won't laugh. A lot.</i>

81
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,580
Go, go! Go, go!

82
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,980
Hey! Where you going?

83
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,911
Just like that, Cinderella was gone.

84
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,526
<i>Hey! What's up, man?</i>

85
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,322
How you doing, Ricky?

86
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,117
Always good. There you go.

87
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,619
Hey, hey. Come on.

88
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,165
When was the last time
I charged you for a drink, huh?

89
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,668
<i>Just promise me, though,
you have to dance with mi madre.</i>

90
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,670
Jason scares her.

91
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,672
Look at that!

92
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,051
Look. Jesus!

93
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,973
You look hot in that one!

94
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,436
-That is hot. Give me that, please.
-Let me see.

95
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,105
Yo. 20,000 hits in under five hours.

96
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,482
<i>-Yeah, that's crazy.
-You think that's dope?</i>

97
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,610
Mercury is already working on his artwork
for the next Mob.

98
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,571
<i>I still don't understand how you Know
what he's saying when he never talks.</i>

99
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,448
<i>-It's Jedi mind power, son.
-That's right.</i>

100
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,201
We connect on a much deeper level,
you Know, I Know this guy.

101
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,204
Mind to mind. Eye to eye.

102
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,166
Sean, we really need to start thinking
about this next thing now.

103
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,292
I agree.

104
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,628
<i>We've got to build on our momentum
and generate more hits.</i>

105
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,004
You and that contest.

106
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,341
<i>When I was your age,
I didn't even have the YouTube’s.</i>

107
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,719
<i>First of all, it's YouTube. All right?</i>

108
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,554
-Whatever.
-Check it out, Ricky.

109
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,265
The first page with 10 million hits
gets a hundred grand.

110
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,602
<i>Even if you win that money,
it's not going to last forever.</i>

111
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,604
<i>It's about getting our stuff out there, Ricky.</i>

112
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,315
Generating exposure.
You make a name for yourself.

113
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,359
<i>That's when the real money comes.</i>

114
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:43,029
-Exactly. First we get the money. Right?
-Yeah. Right.

115
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,657
<i>-Then we get the power.
-That's right.</i>

116
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,575
<i>You Know what comes next, don't you, Pen?</i>

117
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,953
So when is the next one?

118
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,624
<i>Soon. Let's not sweat it tonight.</i>

119
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,459
Because tonight we celebrate!

120
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,879
Yeah! To The Mob! To The Mob!

121
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,011
<i>We turn our back and whip
our hair and just shake it off</i>

122
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,597
<i>I turn my back and whip
my hair and just shake it off</i>

123
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,267
-Okay, okay.
-Come on, Sean. Do it.

124
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,143
Ten more minutes. Okay, sweet pea?

125
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,771
<i>I turn my back and whip
my hair and just shake it off</i>

126
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,736
Fine. One verse.

127
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,661
<i>I whip my hair back and forth</i>

128
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,872
<i>-I whip my hair back and forth
-I whip my hair back and forth</i>

129
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,790
<i>-I whip my hair back and forth...
-I whip my hair back and...</i>

130
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,166
<i>Just whip it</i>

131
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,085
This is what I was afraid of.

132
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,212
<i>Once I start feeling that rhythm, I can't stop.</i>

133
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,214
I got a new move for you, okay?

134
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,719
<i>It's called the "ocean motion. "
Here's the ocean, here comes the motion.</i>

135
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,848
You try. Okay? Ocean... Motion...

136
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,474
<i>Let's do it together.</i>

137
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,270
Ocean... Motion...

138
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,355
Ocean motion...

139
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,441
I got you!

140
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,319
<i>Real estate development magnate
Bill Anderson is about to announce</i>

141
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:09,073
<i>a billion-dollar development project
somewhere in downtown Miami.</i>

142
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,659
-Morning.
-I can make you some eggs.

143
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,079
<i>That's okay. I've got to go to work early
for some meeting.</i>

144
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,665
So? You see it?

145
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,502
Come on. It was the best one yet.

146
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,212
<i>Mom, what's Sean taking about?</i>

147
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,340
Your uncle shut down Ocean Drive
yesterday.

148
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,593
<i>Sarah, go brush your teeth.
We're gonna leave in five minutes.</i>

149
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,137
Fine.

150
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,140
Could you please stop that?

151
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,852
<i>I don't want her thinking
that what you're doing is okay.</i>

152
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,020
<i>What's wrong with it?</i>

153
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,857
You were on the news again yesterday.

154
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,109
<i>What's gonna happen
when you get arrested?</i>

155
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,322
<i>I'm not gonna get busted.
Why are you acting like this?</i>

156
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,951
Because this whole contest
is a long shot. At best.

157
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,079
<i>Why don't you go back to school
and get a profession?</i>

158
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,749
<i>Didn't you ever want to be a part
of something different?</i>

159
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,794
My little brother,
the professional flash mobber.

160
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,630
Hey.

161
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,384
I was taking to my friend, Jessica.

162
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,886
Take a look at this.

163
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,097
She works at this shipping company,

164
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,766
and they have this
management training program.

165
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,226
You have to start out at the bottom,

166
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,521
but if you catch on,
they even pay for your night school.

167
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,606
Please just think about it.

168
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,108
<i>I don't have to think about it.</i>

169
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,195
We are gonna win this thing.

170
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:34,117
<i>When we do, people are gonna notice.
They'll have to.</i>

171
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,204
Sarah, come on!

172
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,917
<i>Well, let's hope so.</i>

173
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,587
<i>Because right now, you're getting
your butts Kicked by a singing cat.</i>

174
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,174
I Knew you watched it!

175
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,206
<i>I came to Miami for one reason.</i>

176
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,752
To turn the Dimont into the top destination
in South Beach.

177
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,421
<i>And that's just the beginning.
In the coming months,</i>

178
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,758
I plan to break ground
on a new hotel and residential complex.

179
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:36,262
And after that, continue building
the greatest hotels Miami has ever seen.

180
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,057
If you work hard for me,
I will be loyal to you.

181
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,727
Mr. Ryan, for example, started working for
me when he was still in business school.

182
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,645
<i>And now he's general manager
of the Dimont.</i>

183
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,106
Come on, damn it!

184
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,487
Young man.

185
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,906
The entire staff was asked
to be here 20 minutes ago.

186
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,159
<i>I'm sorry. My alarm is all messed up.</i>

187
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,995
I accept your apology,
but you no longer work here.

188
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,163
Wait... What?

189
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,666
<i>Don't bother staying. In our profession,
punctuality is not an option.</i>

190
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,752
<i>I've worked here over a year!</i>

191
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,837
Do we need security to escort you out?

192
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,972
<i>There's a flip-side to my loyalty.</i>

193
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,309
<i>If you don't hold up your end of the deal,
I don't owe you anything.</i>

194
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,271
Anderson customers expect excellence.
I expect nothing less from you.

195
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,606
Thank you.

196
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,399
Thank you, Mr. Anderson.

197
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,777
<i>Okay, let's get to work.</i>

198
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,280
How could you say that?

199
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,950
Because the whole thing goes against
every instinct I have as a parent.

200
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,618
<i>I don't understand why.</i>

201
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,953
Look at it from my perspective.

202
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,080
<i>It's like I'm rewarding you
for dropping out of college.</i>

203
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,291
I only went to college
because you wanted me to.

204
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,336
So this is all about
the Wynwood thing, right?

205
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,797
<i>They're one of the best contemporary
dance companies in the world, Dad.</i>

206
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,173
You Know how I feel about this.

207
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,342
How many people make it as a dancer?

208
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,136
One out of 1,000? One out of 10,000?

209
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,221
<i>-Yeah.
-It's one thing to dance when you're a Kid,</i>

210
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,515
<i>and it's another thing
to try to make a career out of it.</i>

211
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,642
Thanks for the support.

212
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,020
<i>I'll have the eggs Benedict.</i>

213
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,105
Fruit and yogurt?

214
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,024
Fruit and yogurt for the young lady.

215
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,195
Hi.

216
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,324
Oh, my God! I am so sorry.

217
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,118
<i>It's all right. No problem.</i>

218
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,872
Emily, most people would Kill
for an opportunity

219
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,666
like the one
I am practically begging you to take.

220
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,669
You work hard, you could end up running
the whole company.

221
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,296
<i>I just don't understand the attitude...</i>

222
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,422
<i>I'll grab you another orange juice.</i>

223
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,592
<i>Emily! I'm taking to you.</i>

224
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,468
I heard you.

225
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,220
<i>Let's agree to this.</i>

226
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:45,349
<i>Either you're a professional dancer
by the end of the summer,</i>

227
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,602
or you come home to Cleveland
and work for me.

228
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,356
We used to see eye-to-eye on everything.

229
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,444
You remember?
Emily and Dad versus the world?

230
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,405
What happened?

231
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,035
We can still see eye-to-eye, Dad.

232
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,703
We can.

233
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:11,000
I just also wish that you could want for me
what I want for myself.

234
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,678
Sorry.

235
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,137
What are you doing?

236
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:08,224
I was just getting off of work.
I heard the music.

237
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,184
<i>I'm Sean.</i>

238
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,478
<i>You're Emily, right?</i>

239
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,563
<i>We've met at the club.</i>

240
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,690
I Know.

241
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,149
You do?

242
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,361
<i>That's funny. It didn't seem like you did</i>

243
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,072
when your dad was around.

244
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,116
<i>My dad doesn't need
to Know my every move.</i>

245
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,412
<i>Sorry. I'm just upset.</i>

246
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,164
It was beautiful, by the way. Your dance.

247
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,793
<i>Thank you. It's okay. Kind of boring.</i>

248
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,421
<i>What are you taking about?
You're an incredible dancer.</i>

249
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Not good enough.

250
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,175
For what?

251
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,096
An audition.
A routine I have to put together.

252
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,431
<i>It's not like you're gonna
Know the company.</i>

253
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,557
Try me.

254
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,142
<i>It's called Wynwood.</i>

255
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:54,603
<i>Olivia Brownyn's company.
Yeah, they're amazing.</i>

256
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,771
You Know Wynwood?

257
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,856
Well, I dance.

258
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,984
<i>And there's this space-age technology
called the Internet now.</i>

259
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,778
Right. Sorry.

260
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,284
<i>Doesn't matter anyway,
because I'm probably not gonna make it.</i>

261
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,494
-Can I make a suggestion?
-Sure.

262
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,123
Incorporate some of the moves
you did at the club.

263
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,208
That girl was not boring.

264
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:20,921
<i>I can't just do whatever I want.
There are rules.</i>

265
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,632
Hey!

266
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,887
Break the rules.

267
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,354
What are you doing Friday night?

268
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,647
<i>-Why?
-There's something I want to show you.</i>

269
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,358
What is it?

270
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,817
Just trust me.

271
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:48,949
Be at this address Friday night at 8:00.

272
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,499
<i>Thank you, but I'd rather work through
this on my own.</i>

273
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,501
I get it.

274
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,464
Daddy might not approve.

275
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,969
And wear something nice.

276
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,727
What a day, huh?

277
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,438
Listen, bro,
I want to talk to you about this morning.

278
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,564
I would have walked out with you, but...

279
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,818
<i>You don't need to do that, man.</i>

280
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,655
<i>Then we'd both be out of a job.</i>

281
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,992
<i>Listen, we'll do a few more Mobs,
get the hits,</i>

282
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,120
<i>we'll win that money, okay?</i>

283
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,996
Okay.

284
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,456
All right.

285
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:42,503
<i>I think I've got this next thing figured out.
Ready to go?</i>

286
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,132
<i>Thought you'd never ask.</i>

287
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,592
<i>Let's hit up the garage.</i>

288
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:06,735
<i>Okay. Ocean Drive was great at scoring us
some serious hits on YouTube.</i>

289
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,363
<i>But this next Mob will be
a bit more complicated.</i>

290
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,783
<i>Okay. So, there are
two main entrances and exits,</i>

291
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,202
<i>and a back door that opens to the street.</i>

292
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:19,039
<i>Let's have the van waiting right outside.
That's our escape route.</i>

293
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:30,009
<i>How are we gonna get dancers in and out
without them getting noticed?</i>

294
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,553
<i>One word, man. Camouflage.</i>

295
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,531
<i>There's gonna be security this time,</i>

296
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,659
<i>under the supervision
of Director Jennifer Gibgot.</i>

297
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,411
We have a phenomenal exhibit.
And I need you to...

298
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,496
<i>What about music?</i>

299
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,499
<i>I was thinking Penelope should look into
seeking some new employment.</i>

300
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,335
The last gentleman we had played
the music much too loud.

301
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,754
So do your best to Keep a low profile.

302
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,255
Low profile. Got it.

303
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,933
<i>This is definitely gonna get us a lot of hits.</i>

304
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:23,020
<i>Either way, The Mob is gonna put
its own spin on fine art.</i>

305
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,818
Thanks.

306
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,158
Thank you.

307
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,910
Okay, thank you all for coming.

308
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:23,372
I can only imagine
how difficult this is to audition,

309
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,332
let alone audition for me.

310
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,168
I am not an easy one. I get it.

311
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,379
But remember,

312
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,174
<i>if everyone could do this,
we wouldn't be Wynwood.</i>

313
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,844
<i>We're about to name the dancers</i>

314
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,513
<i>who've been invited
to apprentice with Wynwood.</i>

315
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:44,476
At the end of this summer, each dancer
will perform a routine of their own selection.

316
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:49,982
We will then select one male and one female
to formally join our company.

317
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,109
And the new apprentices are...

318
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,197
Vera Williams, Josh Torres,

319
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:01,076
Melba Watson, Mobey Shakur,

320
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,787
and Emily Anderson.

321
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,040
Thank you and congratulations.

322
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,757
Emily, where did you study?

323
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,343
With Max Sternberg at NYU.

324
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,678
Your technique is good.

325
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,889
Exquisite, actually.

326
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,434
Which means absolutely nothing.

327
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:30,689
Baby girl, you lack originality,
and I suggest you find some.

328
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,858
<i>You've got to.</i>

329
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,094
Thank you.

330
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,322
You made it.

331
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,206
<i>So what's with all the mystery?</i>

332
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:32,292
Is this some sort of lame way you get girls
to go out with you?

333
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,796
<i>It's not a date. Promise.</i>

334
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,048
<i>Come on, we've got to hustle.</i>

335
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,717
You look beautiful, by the way.

336
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,141
<i>It's still not a date.</i>

337
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:48,892
You look nice, too.

338
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,276
<i>Where did you get the vino?</i>

339
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,955
So why are we here?

340
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,208
Just thought you could
use some inspiration.

341
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,274
Wait.

342
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:38,580
<i>-A group of dancers were able to break out...
-... strikes again...</i>

343
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,209
<i>...still attempting to identify the dancers...</i>

344
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,919
<i>The Mob struck again last night
this time taking over</i>

345
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,588
<i>the Miami Museum of International Arts
and Culture.</i>

346
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,257
<i>The art itself seemed to come to life,
causing delight</i>

347
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,176
<i>in spite of the disruption.</i>

348
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:56,348
<i>Quite the scene last night at the Miami
Museum of International Arts and Culture.</i>

349
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,103
<i>Police continue their investigation,
as many questions remain,</i>

350
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:05,691
<i>including the two most pressing,
Who is The Mob, and what is this all about?</i>

351
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,199
<i>You didn't get the memo?</i>

352
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,784
<i>Guests aren't supposed
to mix with the help.</i>

353
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,994
I want in.

354
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,245
<i>I don't Know what you're taking about.</i>

355
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,247
I want to join The Mob.

356
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,217
<i>You can't talk about that here, okay?</i>

357
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:36,013
<i>Maybe I can help you out with your routine.
The Mob, it's not for you.</i>

358
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,180
<i>That's not good enough.</i>

359
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,182
What we do is dangerous. Okay?

360
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,309
If you get thrown in jail,
your dad is gonna get real pissed.

361
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,270
You were the one who said
I needed to break the rules.

362
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,397
<i>No, there's too much at stake.
We've got to win this contest.</i>

363
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,523
What contest?

364
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,276
YouTube is giving 100 grand
to the first channel that gets 10 million hits.

365
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,361
Then adding another dancer
can only help you.

366
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,114
Sean! Your tables are looking for you.

367
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,116
Be right out. I gotta go.

368
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,534
Look.

369
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,745
I have to get into Wynwood.

370
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,122
<i>And the only way that
I'm gonna be able to do that</i>

371
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,875
is by taking risks
and changing the way I dance.

372
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,754
The Mob is not gonna go for it.
Especially if they find out who you are.

373
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,634
Who says anyone has to Know?

374
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,154
-The second one, for sure.
-Okay.

375
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,614
-Nice work.
-No problem.

376
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,074
Always working out, man.

377
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,283
Yeah.

378
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,827
Yo. What do we have here?

379
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,370
I want to introduce you to someone.

380
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,831
Emily, this is Eddy, co-founder of The Mob.

381
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,291
And my best friend.

382
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,709
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

383
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,377
<i>What's she doing here?</i>

384
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,171
<i>She's gonna join our next mission.</i>

385
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,926
I got her up to speed about the contest
and how things are going down.

386
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,636
She can help.

387
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,971
Sean, can I talk to you for a second?

388
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,393
What the hell is this?

389
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,853
<i>She's an incredible dancer.</i>

390
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,773
<i>So what? Just like that, she's inner circle?</i>

391
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,775
How do I Know I can trust her?

392
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:12,818
Because I vouch for her.

393
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,529
No! We can only trust
the people that we have.

394
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:16,780
<i>What's the issue?</i>

395
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:20,700
<i>We've been saying we need another girl
to really go off and hit choreography.</i>

396
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,454
<i>It's worth a shot, right? She's actually good.</i>

397
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,914
Come on.

398
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,463
Can you get her ready
in time for the next Mob?

399
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,716
Yeah. I think so.

400
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,469
<i>Good. Because you're dancing lead.</i>

401
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,305
<i>Did you say "lead"?</i>

402
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,473
Yeah, I did.

403
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,270
<i>-It's going to be good.
-You'll be good.</i>

404
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,440
Let me introduce you to the crew.

405
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,360
<i>Eddy is our resident Mark Zuckerberg.</i>

406
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:58,196
<i>Anything electronic
or computer-related, he can do.</i>

407
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,489
<i>He's our eyes and ears.</i>

408
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,662
<i>Penelope is the hottest DJ on South Beach.</i>

409
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,081
<i>She creates all the mind-blowing remixes
for our Mobs.</i>

410
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,125
<i>She sets everything in motion.</i>

411
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,963
<i>And Jason just got back from New York</i>

412
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,048
<i>where he was a part of this
crew called The Pirates.</i>

413
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:20,260
<i>Anything we need in terms of effects,
he's our boy.</i>

414
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,182
<i>Mercury is a locally renowned street artist.</i>

415
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,393
<i>No one, I mean no one,
has ever heard him speak.</i>

416
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,979
<i>You know, "Picture's worth
a thousand words" thing.</i>

417
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,732
<i>Iris was huge in the Socal skate scene.</i>

418
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,859
<i>He wanted to put his lens
on something next-level,</i>

419
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,485
<i>so we gave him something to film.</i>

420
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,614
<i>Sly and Adrian are leaders
of our parkour crew.</i>

421
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,449
<i>They handle all of our stunts.</i>

422
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,494
<i>The rest of our crew,
they're from all over the world,</i>

423
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,288
<i>and dance every style there is.</i>

424
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,998
<i>And this is where we put it all together.</i>

425
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,875
<i>It's the Batcave of The Mob.</i>

426
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,003
<i>We wake people up out
of their daily lives, Emily.</i>

427
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,797
<i>We hit them where and when
they least expect it.</i>

428
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:01,760
<i>When The Mob speaks, everyone listens.</i>

429
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,113
You still have time to back out.

430
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,990
<i>Nah, we're good.</i>

431
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,160
You are ready, right?

432
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,238
<i>9-1-1 emergency.</i>

433
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,415
<i>How's that for inspiration?</i>

434
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,708
Unreal.

435
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,562
Thanks.

436
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:23,962
Mind if I cut in?

437
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,633
Can you salsa?

438
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,510
Can I.

439
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,679
<i>All right. Let's see if you can Keep up.</i>

440
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,226
<i>Come on. You've gotta give it up.</i>

441
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,818
You did good. You did.

442
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,362
It was the best Mob yet.

443
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,908
This is great. Come on.

444
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,080
I like it here.

445
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,126
<i>It's not exactly Star Island.</i>

446
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,420
<i>No, it's better. You're lucky.</i>

447
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,715
Lucky?

448
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,634
I wish I grew up in a place like this.

449
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,221
I grew up in hotels.

450
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,432
All different, but all exactly the same.

451
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,435
Clean, sterile, temporary.

452
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,439
People actually live here.

453
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,943
<i>It's great.</i>

454
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,531
It is.

455
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,866
You want to see more of it?

456
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:23,915
This is yours?

457
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,458
How about I show you around?

458
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,691
So when did you start The Mob?

459
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:53,069
It was Eddy who came up
with the idea of doing Mobs.

460
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,196
How long have you Known him?

461
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,656
All my life.

462
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,908
<i>We're more like brothers, I guess.</i>

463
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:03,371
<i>Our folks would go to Ricky’s every night
and we'd be there,</i>

464
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,332
these little Kids, just wilding out.

465
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,091
Then my pops took off.

466
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,344
Moms met her new man

467
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,472
<i>and ever since then,
it's Kind of been us against the world.</i>

468
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,311
<i>That's what it was like for me, too.</i>

469
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,855
Me and my dad right after my mom split.

470
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,065
We were inseparable.

471
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,776
What happened?

472
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:40,867
I got my own ideas
about what I wanted to do.

473
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,161
You Know? With my life.

474
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:46,331
<i>And he's had a really hard time
accepting that.</i>

475
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,293
You should be able to do
what you want to do.

476
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,211
<i>It's not that simple.</i>

477
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,255
Why not?

478
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:57,008
<i>You don't understand, Sean.</i>

479
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,843
I wish I was like you.

480
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:01,888
I could just do whatever I wanted.

481
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,098
You Know? Break the rules.

482
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,142
Me?

483
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:09,187
<i>You've got to realize, guys like Eddy and I,</i>

484
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,357
<i>we're invisible in this city.</i>

485
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:17,403
<i>That's Kind of how we came up
with the idea of doing Mobs.</i>

486
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,908
<i>It's like us saying, "Listen up. "</i>

487
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,120
<i>"We exist. This city is ours, too. "</i>

488
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,422
-Does that sound lame?
-No.

489
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,716
Not at all.

490
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,002
Hey, Ricky.

491
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,884
<i>What's wrong?</i>

492
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:07,013
Ever hear of Anderson Global Properties?

493
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,141
Yeah. Why?

494
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,227
This Anderson guy,

495
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,730
he wants to build some sort of development.

496
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,233
Luxury hotel. Designer shops.

497
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,862
<i>He's buying the whole strip
on this side of the river.</i>

498
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,614
This bar, your home,

499
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:27,575
the shop where your sister works, all gone.

500
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,290
Can you believe this?

501
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,501
<i>It's the same asshole that fired me.</i>

502
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:42,048
<i>This guy can't walk in here
and take everything we have.</i>

503
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,551
<i>Can't you just say no, Ricky?</i>

504
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:46,969
<i>It's not my choice, hijo.</i>

505
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:50,056
<i>I'm like everyone around here. I rent.</i>

506
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,854
A lot of people are making
a living on this strip.

507
00:46:57,022 --> 00:47:00,358
<i>And now everything's gonna be wiped out.
Gone.</i>

508
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:11,911
Emily!

509
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,249
Hey! Where are you going?

510
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,917
To talk to my dad.

511
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,126
Is it gonna help?

512
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,878
<i>I don't Know, but I have to try.</i>

513
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,505
<i>We have to tell your friends
that he's my dad.</i>

514
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:23,589
They deserve that much.

515
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:26,300
<i>I don't Know. Eddy almost lost it in there.</i>

516
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,802
<i>And Ricky, I've never seen him like that.</i>

517
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,805
Right now, I think it might make it worse.

518
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,360
<i>You want to at least tell me
where you've been?</i>

519
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,738
I was out with a friend. It got late.

520
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,283
So you spent the night with some guy?

521
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,285
<i>It wasn't like that.</i>

522
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:55,496
<i>Just don't do it again. I've got a meeting.</i>

523
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:00,251
Are you planning to build in
the Spring Gardens district?

524
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,338
Why do you ask?

525
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,304
My friend, Sean. He lives there.

526
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,472
This just Keeps getting better.

527
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,974
So you spent the night in a slum.

528
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,976
-It is not a slum.
-Emily...

529
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,853
Daddy, I wish you could see it.

530
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,022
The same families
have lived there for decades.

531
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:23,399
Every time I build,
something else gets Knocked down.

532
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:26,611
<i>Someone's house, someone's business.
It's the price of progress.</i>

533
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,738
Besides, this is a done deal.

534
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,198
Trip is meeting with the city council
next Thursday.

535
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:35,244
And once they give it the okay,
we break ground at the end of the month.

536
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,705
<i>Please, don't do this.</i>

537
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,790
<i>Let's make a deal.</i>

538
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,001
<i>I won't tell you how to dance,</i>

539
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,297
<i>and you don't tell me
how to run my company.</i>

540
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,019
<i>All right, let's take five.</i>

541
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,440
Emily...

542
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,194
Where are you?

543
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,320
<i>I'm right here.</i>

544
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,072
<i>You're not here.</i>

545
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,617
<i>I'm watching you,</i>

546
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:19,372
<i>and it's like you're being
blown around the studio like a leaf.</i>

547
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,546
Take control, Emily.

548
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,343
<i>Let's take it from the top.</i>

549
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,811
Where have you been?

550
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:47,066
<i>Emily's got an idea for the next Mob.</i>

551
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,487
<i>I really don't need Cinderella coming in here</i>

552
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,572
and messing with the program.

553
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,825
We need to be working on the next Mob.

554
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,326
<i>We've already got over 4,000,000 hits.</i>

555
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,579
<i>So you got a lot of hits on YouTube.
That's great.</i>

556
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,791
<i>Maybe you'll win this thing,
and you'll win some money,</i>

557
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:07,211
<i>but it's not gonna change anything.
Believe me.</i>

558
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,508
You have 4,000,000 people listening,

559
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,261
<i>but you're not saying anything
that actually matters.</i>

560
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:20,057
<i>It's not okay to make art for fun anymore,
and it's not okay to make trouble either.</i>

561
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,767
So what are you proposing?

562
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,854
<i>I'm saying enough with performance art.</i>

563
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,981
<i>It's time for protest art.</i>

564
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,902
Anderson Global Properties
is pitching the project

565
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,529
to the city council in a week.

566
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:36,949
<i>They have to have the council’s approval
to move forward, so...</i>

567
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,701
I think we should join them.

568
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:41,120
<i>So we're gonna mob the meeting?</i>

569
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,540
<i>I'm down.</i>

570
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:45,958
How do you Know all this?

571
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,672
City council meetings are public record.

572
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:56,260
<i>And there's this space-age device
called the Internet now.</i>

573
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:01,807
Think about it.

574
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:06,520
Instead ofjust getting hits,
we can make a statement.

575
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,693
<i>I'm listening. What's the plan?</i>

576
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:17,364
<i>Well, we're gonna need some more dancers.</i>

577
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,162
<i>All right, folks. Let's take our seats.</i>

578
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,332
<i>I really appreciate everyone being here.</i>

579
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,417
<i>I'm excited about what we have to show you.</i>

580
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,711
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Bob Cooper.

581
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,671
Bob is a partner of Cooper and Mackey,

582
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:35,800
one of the largest
marketing firms in the U.S.

583
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:40,221
Bob has agreed to personally oversee
the campaign for our new development.

584
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,014
<i>It's my pleasure.</i>

585
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,183
<i>He'll lay out a detailed plan for us in a sec,</i>

586
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:48,854
<i>but first I'd like to direct your attention
to our plan to renovate the riverside.</i>

587
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,738
Okay...

588
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:01,700
Folks, we should probably step outside.

589
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,830
<i>Just file out. I'm sure it's nothing
to be too concerned about.</i>

590
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,706
I apologize for this.

591
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,709
<i>I don't Know if it's a drill or not,
but we'll get to the bottom of it.</i>

592
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,044
Follow me.

593
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,964
<i>We'll just do what they need us to do
and get back up there.</i>

594
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,633
Great tie, by the way.

595
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:49,934
<i>What the hell's going on here, Trip?</i>

596
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,122
<i>There's no need to film this.</i>

597
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,795
Should we be worried about this, Trip?

598
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,254
No. Not at all.

599
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,008
Just a bunch of stupid Kids.

600
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,886
A bunch of stupid Kids did that?

601
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,306
Yeah.

602
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,060
<i>The flash mob
was apparently targeting a meeting</i>

603
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,938
<i>between the city council and members
of Anderson Global Properties.</i>

604
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:43,148
<i>Mom, look, it's Sean.</i>

605
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,650
Are you sure?

606
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:47,820
<i>Yeah, he's doing the "ocean motion. "</i>

607
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,744
<i>All indications
are that the video is quickly going viral</i>

608
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:59,998
<i>turning these local art vigilantes
into something of a cultural phenomenon.</i>

609
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,799
<i>Sean... Guys. You're not gonna believe this.</i>

610
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,886
Another million hits in less than two hours.

611
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,849
<i>We're up to 6,000,000 hits.</i>

612
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,772
<i>If you love dance,
you are going to love this next story.</i>

613
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,859
<i>I've just seen this video, and all I can
tell you is, in one word, amazing.</i>

614
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,694
<i>I've never seen anything like this before.</i>

615
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,530
<i>The video was posted to YouTube
and has quickly gone viral,</i>

616
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:34,324
<i>thrusting these mysterious
artists into the spotlight.</i>

617
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,201
<i>And it's quickly becoming
an Internet sensation.</i>

618
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,870
<i>And before we announce the winner...</i>

619
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:41,290
<i>Have you guys seen this viral
video by The Mob? It's huge!</i>

620
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,041
<i>Another developing story
we're following today...</i>

621
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,710
<i>And it seems to be picking up steam.</i>

622
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,379
<i>Everyone is talking about this,
so I have to bring it up.</i>

623
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,131
<i>Who knows about The Mob?</i>

624
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,803
<i>This neighborhood is all I've ever known.</i>

625
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,515
<i>She was born here, we live here,
we don't plan on leaving.</i>

626
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:03,061
<i>For you guys to do what you did for me,
my family, families like mine...</i>

627
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:06,565
<i>You gave us a voice,
and we're just so thankful for that.</i>

628
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:07,900
<i>Don't know what I can say but thank you.</i>

629
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,651
<i>We are so thankful, huh?</i>

630
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:10,777
<i>-Yes.
-Yeah.</i>

631
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:13,405
<i>What about this rogue Miami flash mob
stirring up all kinds of trouble?</i>

632
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:16,742
<i>A lot of celebrities are tweeting
this week about The Mob.</i>

633
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,203
<i>Have you seen this video
about these kids in Miami?</i>

634
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,997
<i>I'll tell you one thing that makes sense in
any language, the art of dance.</i>

635
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,166
<i>Ten million hits!</i>

636
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,709
<i>I am in! Yes!</i>

637
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,672
<i>With the public rallying
behind The Mob's cause,</i>

638
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,549
<i>support for Anderson is crumbling.</i>

639
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:36,553
<i>The latest polls of the council suggest
that if the vote were taken today,</i>

640
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,556
<i>Anderson's project would not be approved.</i>

641
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:54,131
Nice. Yes, Emily, better.

642
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:05,809
Take your time.

643
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,352
Good.

644
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,527
<i>I've got you.</i>

645
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,827
I love it.

646
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,413
You have nothing to worry about.

647
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:28,707
<i>The audition's gonna be great.</i>

648
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,418
I really appreciate all your help.

649
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:42,054
Your dad say anything
about the city council Mob?

650
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,681
No. But it definitely worked.
I can tell it shook him up.

651
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,101
<i>He'd freak out if he Knew I was involved.</i>

652
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:52,356
<i>You don't feel bad
sabotaging your dad's development?</i>

653
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,737
How else are we supposed
to stop my big, horrible, greedy father

654
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,531
from destroying
your beautiful neighborhood?

655
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:07,037
No, I do feel guilty.

656
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,206
But as much as I love my father,

657
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:13,251
<i>there's a thousand other places my dad
could stick some nauseating luxury hotel.</i>

658
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:15,796
<i>He'll be fine. Trust me.</i>

659
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,800
How are things between you guys?

660
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,719
<i>He has some big gala he's making me go to.</i>

661
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,430
And Trip asked me to be his date.

662
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,226
<i>He thinks I'm some way
to get closer to my dad.</i>

663
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,852
Of course I said no.

664
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,772
But, I just wish you could go.

665
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,024
<i>I'm sure I'll be there.</i>

666
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:39,528
<i>Of course, I'll be on the other side
of the table with a drink tray.</i>

667
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,238
Can we do it a few more times?

668
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:42,322
<i>I don't Know...</i>

669
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,448
Just one more time.

670
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,201
<i>I think there's something else
that's a little more fun we could do.</i>

671
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,328
<i>-Come on. Let's do it.
-No, no.</i>

672
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,454
Yes.

673
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,168
Can I come in?

674
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,219
So how is everything
with the dance company?

675
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:07,305
<i>Good. I've got my final audition
in a couple of days.</i>

676
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:08,682
Wow.

677
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:10,976
Good luck.

678
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,310
Thanks.

679
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,441
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah.

680
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,111
<i>It's been a rough couple of days.</i>

681
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,822
<i>Glad I've still got you on my side.</i>

682
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:28,076
Emily and Dad against the world. Right?

683
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:31,538
Right.

684
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:38,628
<i>I'II let you get some sleep.
Good night, sweetie.</i>

685
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,048
Good night, Dad.

686
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,930
Man, this better be important.

687
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:51,266
<i>I was playing that new Call of Duty
and Kicking some ass!</i>

688
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,518
I was just about to make the moves on her
and I got the call.

689
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,812
What up, Eddy?

690
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:59,524
<i>What did you want to show us?
Where's Sean?</i>

691
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:03,528
Here, take a look.
I found their rehearsal footage.

692
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:06,615
<i>He would freak out
if he knew I was involved.</i>

693
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,910
<i>You don't feel bad sabotaging
your dad's development?</i>

694
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:13,121
<i>How else are we supposed to stop
my big, horrible, greedy father</i>

695
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,332
<i>from destroying
your beautiful neighborhood?</i>

696
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,293
-Are you sure?
-I looked her up.

697
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:21,880
<i>Emily Anderson. She's his daughter.</i>

698
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,299
<i>-That's crazy.
-What?</i>

699
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:28,720
Maybe we should call Sean
and get to the bottom of it.

700
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:29,888
No.

701
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,389
No.

702
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:33,892
<i>I've got a better idea.</i>

703
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:45,821
<i>It's going to be a big crowd tonight.</i>

704
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:47,197
I think it will be good for us both.

705
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:48,657
<i>There's my beautiful daughter. Excuse me.</i>

706
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,992
<i>I'm so glad you came, Emily.</i>

707
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:53,286
You look beautiful.

708
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:54,663
Thank you.

709
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:56,957
<i>What do you think?
Didn't Trip do a great job with all this?</i>

710
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,085
Shall we?

711
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,171
<i>I'd like to thank everyone for being here.</i>

712
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,507
<i>Now, with no further ado,</i>

713
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:09,427
<i>the man responsible
for the city's latest beautification project,</i>

714
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:11,513
<i>Mr. Bill Anderson.</i>

715
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,182
<i>Thank you, Trip.</i>

716
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,309
<i>Thank you all.</i>

717
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,270
<i>I'd like to extend a very special welcome</i>

718
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,105
<i>to the great Mayor of Miami,</i>

719
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,857
<i>my good friend, Donald Hernandez.</i>

720
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,110
<i>All of us at Anderson Global Properties</i>

721
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:28,446
<i>look forward to a long working relationship
with the city council</i>

722
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:31,032
<i>and the entire Spring Gardens community.</i>

723
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,243
<i>And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.</i>

724
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:37,205
<i>I'd like to present to you El Frente Del Rio.</i>

725
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:54,472
<i>I think we're having
some technical difficulties.</i>

726
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:56,975
<i>Why don't we cut the video?</i>

727
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,184
<i>Please cut the video.</i>

728
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:11,907
-Call the police.
-Already done.

729
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:52,572
<i>You don't feel bad
sabotaging your dad's development?</i>

730
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:57,035
<i>How else are we supposed to stop
my big, horrible, greedy father</i>

731
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,371
<i>from destroying
your beautiful neighborhood?</i>

732
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:00,455
Emily?

733
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,457
<i>He would freak out
if he knew I was involved.</i>

734
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,751
<i>Freak out if he knew I was involved.</i>

735
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:11,049
<i>My big, horrible, greedy,
greedy-greedy father...</i>

736
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:13,969
<i>How else are we supposed
to stop my greedy, greedy...</i>

737
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:16,888
Mayor! Stop!

738
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,530
What are you doing?

739
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:36,074
<i>What you didn't have the balls to do.</i>

740
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:39,911
<i>Or were you too busy banging
the boss's daughter to care?</i>

741
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:42,998
-Emily!
-You used me!

742
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:45,458
I swear to God
I did not Know Eddy was gonna do that.

743
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,961
<i>Stop it. These guys don't
make a move without you, Sean.</i>

744
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:49,629
-Emily!
-Leave me alone.

745
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,774
You lied to me, Sean. You lied to all of us.

746
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:12,068
I did, Eddy. I lied to you.

747
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,612
I was trying to protect a girl
I really care about,

748
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:16,573
but I guess it taught me a lesson.

749
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:17,949
Shut up, both of you!

750
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,119
You Knuckleheads never Know
when to give up, do you?

751
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,457
Your little stunt is all over the news.

752
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:29,794
<i>We've been disqualified.</i>

753
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:31,963
<i>That's impossible. We got the hits.</i>

754
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:35,008
Yeah, well, I got an email
from corporate office this morning.

755
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,343
<i>They don't want to be associated
with criminal activities.</i>

756
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:38,636
<i>That's bullshit.</i>

757
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:41,139
<i>Anderson's pressing charges. We're out.</i>

758
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:44,809
Guess we both got taught a lesson, huh?

759
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:48,646
Screw them. Screw you, too!

760
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:51,483
Too late, Eddy.
You already screwed everyone.

761
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:53,151
What did you think was
going to happen, Sean?

762
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,487
Think the old man was just gonna
give you his blessing?

763
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:58,364
You go live happily ever after
with his little princess?

764
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,994
<i>You Know what? I can't believe
after everything we've been through,</i>

765
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:05,205
<i>you'd pick that lying bitch over me!</i>

766
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:08,666
Look, I was the one who told her
to Keep quiet about her father

767
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,711
because I Knew you were
too stubborn to get past it.

768
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,214
You might think a lot of things about her,

769
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:17,926
but she would never do that to someone.

770
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:20,011
I quit.

771
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,346
Get off me, man!

772
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,024
<i>Hey, it's Emily.</i>

773
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,734
<i>Leave me a message and I'll call you back.</i>

774
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:38,071
<i>Emily, it's Sean. You have to believe me.</i>

775
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,032
<i>I had nothing to do with
what went down last night.</i>

776
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:44,119
<i>Please just give me a chance
to try and explain things.</i>

777
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,871
You have my number.

778
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,228
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

779
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:14,899
I never meant to hurt you.

780
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:24,784
<i>It's all over now.</i>

781
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,203
The plans were approved.

782
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,747
<i>We're gonna start construction right away.</i>

783
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:50,518
<i>Where's Sean?</i>

784
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,604
He came by this morning to help.

785
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,781
<i>You have no messages.</i>

786
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:08,661
Where do you want this?

787
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,504
Here.

788
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:32,560
Emily Anderson.

789
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:40,026
Emily, I thought you were doing a duet.

790
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,654
<i>I've changed my mind.</i>

791
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:45,031
<i>I'm doing a solo.</i>

792
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:57,437
Emily!

793
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:02,233
Emily.

794
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:05,987
What are you doing here?

795
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:15,121
I had to Know. You make the company?

796
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:21,586
What are you gonna do?

797
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:25,131
Keep my promise.
Go back and work for my dad.

798
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,759
<i>Don't do that. Don't give up.</i>

799
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:32,430
<i>What about you? When's the next Mob?</i>

800
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:38,019
Your home is being destroyed.

801
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,271
You should be fighting for what you want.

802
01:12:57,456 --> 01:13:00,500
This is where Sean and I came up
with the first Mob.

803
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,043
Right here.

804
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:06,672
<i>You Know, this lucha between you two,
it's no good.</i>

805
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,342
<i>Well, I didn't start it.</i>

806
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:13,012
But you ended it. And made it a lot worse.

807
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,182
He lied to me, Ricky.

808
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:20,645
<i>You're young.
You haven't met that special someone yet.</i>

809
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:24,482
<i>So you don't Know. But one day you will.</i>

810
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:25,900
And when you do,

811
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:30,154
<i>I hope you won't lose that special someone
the way your friend did.</i>

812
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:34,283
Go make it right, will you?

813
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,619
Please.

814
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,463
What are you looking at?

815
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,384
<i>What's going on?</i>

816
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:58,349
<i>I really messed up.
And I don't have an excuse</i>

817
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,686
<i>other than... I don't Know...</i>

818
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:05,440
<i>It just felt like we've always had that whole</i>

819
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,525
<i>"you and me against the world" thing.</i>

820
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:11,737
<i>I started to feel like it was fading.
But it doesn't matter. It was stupid.</i>

821
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,032
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

822
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:18,077
<i>It's not all on you.</i>

823
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:21,330
I should have never lied to you.

824
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:23,875
<i>Does that mean I've got
my best friend back?</i>

825
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,085
<i>I don't Know.</i>

826
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:27,628
Supposed to exchange rings or something?

827
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:29,422
God, no.

828
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:32,758
But you Knocked one of my fillings loose,
you crazy freak.

829
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:36,095
From now on, this is the only thing
you get to hit, okay?

830
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:39,724
Hang on.

831
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,394
<i>-Yo, Sean.
-Hey, what's up?</i>

832
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:52,111
<i>We're sorry, man. All of us.</i>

833
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,489
<i>Yeah, The Mob ain't the same without you.</i>

834
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,741
We took The Mob, everything we had,

835
01:14:56,909 --> 01:15:00,995
we turned something positive
into something ugly.

836
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:04,373
<i>Maybe there's a way to fix all that.</i>

837
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,666
To give us one more shot.

838
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:07,251
To do what?

839
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:11,172
To do what The Mob was intended to do.
To be heard.

840
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:14,091
<i>It's not about a contest anymore.</i>

841
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:17,094
<i>It's about giving the people
that can't speak a voice.</i>

842
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:21,933
<i>Only thing is, we're gonna need
more voices. A lot more.</i>

843
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,684
<i>That shouldn't be a problem.</i>

844
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:26,395
<i>We've got a lot of folks around here
that like to be heard.</i>

845
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,563
<i>That's so true.</i>

846
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:29,106
<i>Well, we've got some work to do.</i>

847
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:32,151
Yeah, baby!

848
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,320
<i>We don't have to replace him after all.</i>

849
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:41,285
Five, six, seven, eight.

850
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:44,622
Listen up, listen up!

851
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:47,833
<i>It's not a freestyle session. It's up here.
The second one is down here.</i>

852
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:51,879
Do it again.

853
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:09,730
<i>If this works, it's gonna be a damn miracle.</i>

854
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:11,816
Yeah.

855
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:13,651
<i>We're gonna need all the help we can get.</i>

856
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,361
<i>Jason. What's up?</i>

857
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:16,946
<i>What's going on?</i>

858
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:19,156
<i>I've got something big
popping off in Miami.</i>

859
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:23,160
<i>I'm gonna need some bangers
to help pull it off. What do you think?</i>

860
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:25,079
<i>Okay. What have you got in mind?</i>

861
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,265
Check this out.

862
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:47,018
<i>That's fresh, right?</i>

863
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:51,063
Now imagine a bunch of people doing that,
coming down the way we want to.

864
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:52,857
<i>That's cool. But what are we
gonna do about costumes?</i>

865
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:54,150
<i>I've got it.</i>

866
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:57,111
So, he has costumes now?

867
01:16:57,946 --> 01:16:59,196
He just talked.

868
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:26,349
<i>You know what, my friends?
Today is our day.</i>

869
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:29,935
<i>And what an exciting day
for this neighborhood</i>

870
01:17:30,562 --> 01:17:34,231
<i>which is about to enter
a new era of prosperity.</i>

871
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:37,068
<i>Thank you.</i>

872
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:41,155
<i>It's been a difficult journey
to get to this moment,</i>

873
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:43,449
<i>lots of discussions, some disagreements...</i>

874
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:44,950
<i>I'm glad you're here.</i>

875
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:49,121
<i>We'll be back in Cleveland soon,
put all this behind us. Okay?</i>

876
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,082
<i>Now I'm proud to welcome up here</i>

877
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,459
<i>my dear friend, Bill Anderson,</i>

878
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:57,588
<i>and to present to him,
as a token of this occasion,</i>

879
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:00,966
a shovel that would say...

880
01:18:01,968 --> 01:18:03,010
Hello?

881
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:04,845
-Hello?
-Hang on.

882
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,013
<i>What's going on?</i>

883
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,099
Son-of-a-bitch.

884
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:11,519
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

885
01:18:12,312 --> 01:18:13,479
What the hell is that?

886
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:16,273
<i>For weeks you've been
asking, "Who is The Mob?"</i>

887
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:25,658
<i>The Mob is all of us.</i>

888
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:28,160
<i>The Mob is Miami.</i>

889
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,204
<i>And Miami is its culture.</i>

890
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:33,207
<i>If you take down the culture,
you take down Miami.</i>

891
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:36,210
<i>We have something important to say.</i>

892
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:39,880
<i>So now let us say it
in the best way we know how.</i>

893
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:55,140
Hey!

894
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:57,601
<i>Why aren't you doing anything?</i>

895
01:23:53,486 --> 01:23:54,528
Oh, my God...

896
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:06,683
<i>Shut the lights off!</i>

897
01:25:46,724 --> 01:25:48,475
-Well, we did it!
-Not yet.

898
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,310
<i>There's one more thing to do.</i>

899
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:01,113
Go get her back.

900
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:17,462
<i>Come on. Isn't it time
to start fighting for what you want?</i>

901
01:26:20,049 --> 01:26:21,216
Emily?

902
01:29:06,632 --> 01:29:08,300
Hello, Andy, my boy.

903
01:29:08,801 --> 01:29:10,302
<i>I'm Robert Alexander the Third.</i>

904
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:11,428
But you can call me Moose.

905
01:29:11,637 --> 01:29:12,971
-Moose?
-What up?

906
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:19,019
<i>I think it's pretty clear that this community
has something to say to you.</i>

907
01:29:19,103 --> 01:29:21,772
And we are here to help them say it.

908
01:29:22,106 --> 01:29:23,440
Mr. Anderson?

909
01:29:24,108 --> 01:29:27,194
<i>There's no way we can stop you
from destroying our neighborhood.</i>

910
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:31,323
<i>But we wanted to show you
what's being lost in the process.</i>

911
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:33,575
Hey.

912
01:29:33,659 --> 01:29:34,826
<i>I'm sorry about this, Bill.</i>

913
01:29:34,952 --> 01:29:36,536
<i>Things didn't quite go as planned.</i>

914
01:29:36,996 --> 01:29:39,331
Good. Because our plan just changed.

915
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:43,418
<i>Maybe there's a way
we can build this neighborhood up</i>

916
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:44,836
without tearing it down.

917
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:49,341
What do you say?

918
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:53,387
Yeah!

919
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:04,022
<i>But why "Moose"?</i>

920
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:07,734
I think the question
you have to ask yourself is,

921
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:10,237
<i>"Why not 'Moose'?"</i>

922
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:12,489
I feel you, babe. I see you.

923
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,199
Excuse me.

924
01:30:15,159 --> 01:30:16,493
Not now, Bob.

925
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:19,246
Actually, I wanted to talk to him, not you.

926
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:23,708
<i>I'm Bob Cooper, owner of
the marketing firm Mr. Anderson employed.</i>

927
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:28,255
<i>I hope you don't object,
but our biggest client is actually Nike.</i>

928
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:30,298
Yeah?

929
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:31,591
<i>They're looking for something different</i>

930
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:34,302
and a little more cutting edge
for their new campaign.

931
01:30:34,387 --> 01:30:36,096
I think your crew is perfect.

932
01:30:36,389 --> 01:30:38,223
Ready to introduce The Mob to the world?

933
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:40,517
What do you think?

934
01:30:40,893 --> 01:30:43,186
What do I think? Where do I sign?

935
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:04,708
Look at what you did.

936
01:31:05,209 --> 01:31:07,252
You brought all these people together.

937
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:15,218
You Know, we could still use somebody
who Knows how to break the rules.

938
01:31:16,929 --> 01:31:18,138
<i>I'm in.</i>
