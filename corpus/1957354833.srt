- Good job, Juan.

00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,666
- Deer.
- [Hunter] Deer.

74
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,969
Too bad we didn't have our gun
when we were fishing, right?

75

- Kill them.
- [singsong] Yeah.

77
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,307
[Juan] But I don't want
deer to die.

78

They're meat,
but they're animals too.

79
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,480
- Mm-hm.
- There're humans that's up in their habitat.

80
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:43,084
I don't understand your logic.
Continue.

81
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:47,420
They're humans to them,
we're deer to them.

82

That is a good point.
I like it.

I don't want to kill a nature.

84
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,293
Yeah but you will because
otherwise you'll starve to death.

85
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:56,329
And then I'll bury you
out there in the woods.

Can we go back to
Frances-cisco?

important piece of advice

I'm ever going to give you.
Okay?

Right there? In the eyes?

Juan uses the potty, right?

93
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,953

every single time.

103

Shut up.

106

I'm going to go down there
tomorrow and

107
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:03,496

I'll tell you what
they're going to say.

"Next year, we're going to
Vail."

I'm sorry, I have a question.

150

Do you think of Aspen as a town
or as a commodity?

make me feel guilty

our beautiful town,

00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,821
it's not going to happen.

It is moral and legal to
sell a good product

and we've got
a good product here, folks.

156
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:48,562
I don't think the reason that
any of us moved here

157
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:50,131
was to increase the town's GDP.

158
00:08:50,164 --> 00:08:52,266
Okay. Thank you.

159
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:56,003
Now I'm very interested to hear
what our sheriff has cooked up

160
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:58,906
to keep the freeloaders from
setting up shop in this town

161
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,809

How are we supposed to judge him
if he's running unopposed?

That's the last question
I'll take from <i>Aspen Times</i>.

00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:34,909
It shows illegal campgrounds,

174
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:38,879
tenement-style apartments located
here, here, here, and there.

175
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:43,284
There are exactly 844 known
transients in Pitkin County

176
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:45,586
and all but 50 are jobless.

177
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,023
[engine revving]

178
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:51,158
And of course,
The Jerome Hotel.

179
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:53,160
Everybody knows that's where
they're congregating.

180
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:54,628
Most of the problem's...

181
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:55,796
Right here.

182
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,299
[engine idling]

183
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:00,968
[upbeat music]

184
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,046
We're getting soft, sheriff.

185
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:14,915
We're not tough like
we used to be.

186
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,952
They're coming into our bars
asking for free drinks,

187
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:19,987
contributing nothing to society.

188
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,323
I told them we don't serve
long hairs in here.

189
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,059
- Wrap it up, Ricks.
- So I took out old Hickory here

190
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:28,162
- and I gave him a two-handed...
- [Eve] Okay. Sheriff...

191
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:29,697
Put it back, wrap it up.

192
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:33,300
That's enough, Undersheriff Ricks.
Folks, I'm sorry about that.

193
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:35,169
Um... what is that smell?

194
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:39,907
Ladies and gentlemen,
I submit this slag as evidence

195
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:43,811
that Pitkin Mining Corporation
is sodomizing our river.

196
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:47,348
And I'd like to know what our local
government is gonna do about it.

197
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,150
[Eve] Sheriff, please.

198
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:51,085
- This is not on the agenda.
- Right. The agenda.

199
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,920
[Eve] You need to submit it
three weeks ahead of time

200
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,288
- so we can review it.
- Right.

201
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,290
Mine Co. is not
breaking the law.

202
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:59,093
Well, they're certainly
violating some type of statute.

203
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,162
I mean go up there and
tick around, do your job.

204
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:03,197
- That's not really what a sheriff does.
- [Hunter] Why not?

205
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:05,766
Well, we have a strict purview.

206
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,769
- [Eve] Okay, this is not on the agenda.
- Strict purview. Purview.

207
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,271
- [Eve] Sheriff, please.
- Purview.

208
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:12,072
Mr. Thompson, I'm going to
have to ask you leave.

209
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:13,307
[Hunter] Look, from your
purview, you mean.

210
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,043
I don't need to go anywhere.
I'm here at a town hall forum

211
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:18,045
- exhibiting my rights...
- [Sheriff Whitmire] Undersheriff Ricks,

212
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,581
show this man out.

213
00:11:19,614 --> 00:11:21,682
[Hunter] Oh, you're going to come here
and get this, okay come and get it.

214
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,083
Seriously?

215
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:24,818
[audience members shouting]

216
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,154
I'll show you runs
this fucking town, Thompson.

217
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:30,357
If you're not okay with it
being dumped here,

218
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:33,093
you shouldn't be okay with it
being dumped in the fucking river!

219
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:36,397
- You pig.
- [cell door rattles, bangs]

220
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:46,407
Burl, loitering, 30 dollar fine,
30 days in jail.

221
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,409
Man, if I knew I was
blocking the sidewalk,

222
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,811
- I wouldn't've been standing there.
- What'll it be?

223
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:52,947
[Burl] I don't have 30 dollars.

224
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:54,348
Jail it is, Burl.

225
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,483
Del Mar, noise complaint.

226
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:58,852
30 dollar fine, 30 days in jail.

227
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,921
I was just playing the fiddle.

228
00:12:00,955 --> 00:12:05,226
Very noisily.
That's jail, Del Mar.

229
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,462
Thompson, you made bail.

230
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:11,899
Oh, yeah.
Right. Peace joker.

231
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:12,866
Hey, be free.

232
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,202
You know I pay
your goddam salary, Whitmire.

233
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:17,771
It doesn't get dropped in
your mailbox by a stork.

234
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:20,007
Well, I don't make the laws,
I just enforce them.

235
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,176
Yeah, that worked real well
at Nuremberg.

236
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:23,777
- [Sheriff Whitmire] All right, Thompson.
- [Hunter] Hey, man,

237
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:27,081
your badge is a shield because you're
supposed to shield us from harm.

238
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,482
All right, Thompson.

239
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:32,419
So did I make
the front page headlines?

240
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:35,856
[scoffs] Yeah, here's the lead.
"Hunter Thompson,

241
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,892
people's champion,
ruins janitor's day."

242
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,795
How about, "Today's pig is
tomorrow's bacon."

243
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:44,465
[country music]

244
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,072
- [laughter]
- [indistinct chattering]

245
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:57,845
Peggy, those swine
are running a racket in there.

246
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:01,282
Yeah. You got so caught up
in national politics

247
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:03,317
you forgot it's the local stuff
that actually socks you.

248
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,419
I mean, you should've seen
the freaks in that place.

249
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,188
You know, locked up
for absolute bullshit.

250
00:13:08,556 --> 00:13:12,159
Fuckin' playing a fiddle in
public, blocking the sidewalk,

251
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,328
or speaking one's mine at
a town hall meeting.

252
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:17,331
Yeah. Speaking of that town
hall, if there really are

253
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:20,200
844 of those freaks
hanging around Aspen,

254
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:21,569
we might as well
put them to use.

255
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:25,205
No one's ever needed more than 700
to win an election around here.

256
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:27,509
You have enough to start
a third party on your hands.

257
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:29,410
But those freaks can't vote,
they're drifters.

258
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,546
Mm. Colorado law.

259
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:33,515
Only have to have
lived here for 30 days.

260
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:35,949
Huh.

261
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:39,219
This town needs an animal.

262
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:42,056
- Oh, no, hey now...
- [Hunter] Whoa.

263
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,059
Benton, you look like you
could use an anchor rope.

264
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,361
Oh, I have plenty of
anchor rope my friend.

265
00:13:47,562 --> 00:13:49,496
- Give that a try.
- Thank you very much.

266
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:51,298
[Benton] Yes, sir.
Good to see ya, Hunter.

267
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:56,203
This is fucking awful grass,
man.

268
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,405
What you're tasting, Hunter,
is a little pipe tobacco,

269
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:01,141
pure pipe tobacco that
I soaked in some PCP.

270
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,177
- So don't worry about it, don't worry.
- [Hunter] Oh, my God, man.

271
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,478
- Don't waste it, don't waste it!
- I'm fucking...

272
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:07,381
just go out of jail, I'm really
not trying to trip right now.

273
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,183
[Benton] Well, you know,
if you just got out of jail...

274
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,518
- Here, one more.
- [Benton] Come by the studio,

275
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:12,319
- you're hanging out with the pigs...
- [mumbling indistinctly]

276
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:14,288
[Benton]
Come on man. Don't hog it.

277
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,389
Okay.

278
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,525
[film reel clicking]

279
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,268
And two packs of
Dunhill, please.

280
00:14:29,604 --> 00:14:31,338
[cashier] So will you
be paying cash?

281
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:34,341
No, just put it on my,
um, account.

282
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,510
As per usual.

283
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:38,513
Hunter, I'm sorry.
Come on.

284
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:46,286
All right, well then give me the
bag of [indistinct] and the tampon.

285
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,123
Thanks.

286
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:51,024
What are you doing
playing around with that thing?

287
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:52,459
I'm a filmmaker.

288
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:54,328
If you're a filmmaker,
what are you doing

289
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:55,896
working at the grocery store?

290
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,898
Young Ed Wood?

291
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,067
[ambient music]

292
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,903
[engine revving]

293
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:12,680
[Sheriff Whitmire, echoing] <i>Exactly
844 known transients in Pitkin County.</i>

294
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:14,481
[Peggy, echoing] <i>...to win

295
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:16,551
<i>You have enough
to start a third party.</i>

296
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:20,020
[Hunter, echoing]
<i>I could be Muhammad Ali.</i>

297
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:23,457
I could be Muhammad Ali.

298
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,126
I could be Muhammad Ali.

299
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,328
I could be Muhammad Ali.

300
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:31,265
I could be Muhammad Ali.

301
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:33,233
I could be Muhammad Ali.

302
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:35,737
You can get it,
you motherfucker!

303
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,640
- I know we can.
- Hunter, Hunter, stop. Where have you been?

304
00:15:38,673 --> 00:15:40,140
I was in jail.

305
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,411
You've been in jail?
Why didn't you call me?

306
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:46,614
They didn't even give me
a phone call.

307
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:49,617
This Whitmire motherfucker,
Undersheriff,

308
00:15:49,651 --> 00:15:52,554
Dig Nicholas, the whole works.

309
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,456
- Fucked me hard.
- You're fucked up.

310
00:15:56,658 --> 00:15:58,425
I have news, good news.

311
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,128
<i>Rolling Stone</i> called.

312
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,263
What did they say?

313
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:05,633
There's a plane ticket waiting
for you at the airport.

314
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,502
You're going to San Francisco.

315
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:11,138
I don't want to go to
San Fran... cisco.

316
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:13,575
I want to focus on my book

317
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:17,712
and I'm gonna just stay here
and work on the book.

318
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,048
You're going to San Francisco.

319
00:16:21,816 --> 00:16:24,017
If you don't, Juan and I are.

320
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,420
[laughing] You and Juan
are going to San Francisco?

321
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,422
- Oh, yeah.
- You look like you're bluffing.

322
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,594
You're going.

323
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,127
Of course I am.

324
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:39,399

[upbeat music]

327
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,733
- [Hunter] <i>Hey!</i>
- [man] Hunter, thanks for coming out.

328
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:14,201
- Jann. John.
- It's pronounced "Yann,"

329
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,369
pretty sure you already
knew that.

330
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,304
My son, his name is Juan.

331
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,107
- Nice to meet you, Han.
- Sit down, man, uh...

332
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,809
How's it going?
Thanks for bringing me out.

333
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,310
I just read the Derby piece.

334
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:26,246
Love this subjective,
first person,

335
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,550
crazy travelog thing
you got going on.

336
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,785
- Yeah? You like it.
- What else you been working on?

337
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,654
The last two years...

338
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:36,558
working on this death of
the American Dream book

339

is if we could come up with some
kind of ballot measure

the long-hairs to show up

Yeah, as you can see here.

664
00:31:49,176 --> 00:31:52,980
you don't need to establish

No Eve, I can't let you do that.

678
00:32:30,685 --> 00:32:35,088
Folks, you will be arraigned
in two weeks from today

679
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:37,592
in front of the city magistrate.
Is that understood?

680
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,726
[Eve] Okay, enough.

681
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,562
I have stood by you
all these years

682
00:32:40,595 --> 00:32:44,231
and if you think I'm gonna
sit by and let you turn on me,

683
00:32:44,264 --> 00:32:47,067
- you've got another thing coming.
- This is bullshit, Carol.

684
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,636
Just because it's law doesn't
mean that you have

686
00:32:50,404 --> 00:32:52,607
You've seen these transients
come into our town.

687
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,441
You've seen what they've
done to our youth.

688
00:32:54,475 --> 00:32:56,376
You are no longer fit
to be Sheriff,

689
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,980
and that is why I will resign
and run against you.

690
00:33:00,815 --> 00:33:02,149
What?

691
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:05,419
Everybody get out of my office.

692
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:07,020
Now. Everybody out.

693
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:09,056
Success.

694
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:10,758

and contrary to a lifetime
of experiences,

698
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:29,243
the law might actually
be on my side.

It's not just the 72.

Hunter Thompson
is the only candidate

who has the imagination
and intelligence

722

723
00:35:00,935 --> 00:35:02,604
Elect Hunter Thompson Sheriff.

they're not gonna stop at prank calls.

that they're freaks

00:50:31,766 --> 00:50:34,736
and now I have my deputies
out there wearing flak jackets.

1017
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:36,704
Ho Chi Minh isn't
tunneling under Aspen.

1018
00:50:36,738 --> 00:50:38,840
- That's Mine Co.
- [audience laughs]

1019
00:50:38,873 --> 00:50:40,775
Lookie here, you're about
to elect a man

1020
00:50:40,808 --> 00:50:43,678
that calls police officers pigs.

1021
00:50:44,144 --> 00:50:47,414
The only pig
in this town is you.

1022
00:50:47,715 --> 00:50:51,385
When I become Sheriff,
I will put Thompson in jail,

1023
00:50:51,418 --> 00:50:53,755
and that's... that's my promise
to you, Aspen.

1024
00:50:54,454 --> 00:50:57,825
All right, Glenn, it's 1970,
not 1870 all right?

1025
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:01,596
We cannot expect people
to have respect

1026
00:51:01,629 --> 00:51:04,498
for law and order until
we teach respect

1027
00:51:04,532 --> 00:51:07,769
to those we've entrusted to
enforce those laws.

1028
00:51:08,135 --> 00:51:09,637
Well, tell me how you're going
to keep the peace

1029
00:51:09,671 --> 00:51:11,305
when you're high on marijuana?

1030
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:12,774
<i>I don't really like marijuana.</i>

1031
00:51:14,341 --> 00:51:17,411
<i>I much prefer more active
things like acid and mescaline.</i>

1032
00:51:17,812 --> 00:51:20,380
So what you're telling
everybody right now

1033
00:51:20,414 --> 00:51:23,150
is that you would use mescaline
while you're on duty?

1034
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:27,187
- Maybe on the slow nights.
- [scattered laughing]

1035
00:51:27,689 --> 00:51:30,558
Marijuana laws are
one of those reasons

1036
00:51:30,592 --> 00:51:33,126
that have engendered
this lack of respect

1037
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,495
that cops complain about
across the country.

1038
00:51:35,897 --> 00:51:38,900
<i>You get a whole generation
who grew up felons,</i>

1039
00:51:38,933 --> 00:51:40,434
who know the law is ridiculous,

1040
00:51:40,467 --> 00:51:42,135
but they're told
all this gibberish

1041
00:51:42,169 --> 00:51:45,607
that dope rots your brain and
makes your feet fall off.

1042
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,509
- [audience laughing]
- I mean even the cops know it's a silly law.

1043
00:51:48,876 --> 00:51:50,277
<i>But I did ask you a question.</i>

1044
00:51:50,545 --> 00:51:52,245
Carol doesn't know
what he's doing.

1045
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:53,213
He wasn't ready for this.

1046
00:51:53,246 --> 00:51:56,551
No more land rapes,
busts for flute playing.

1047
00:51:56,584 --> 00:51:59,152
<i>Fuck the tourists,
dead-end the highway</i>

1048
00:51:59,186 --> 00:52:01,154
<i>and zone the greed heads
out of existence.</i>

1049
00:52:01,188 --> 00:52:04,826
Create a town where people
can live like human beings

1050
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:08,529
as opposed to slaves to some
bogus sense of progress

1051
00:52:08,563 --> 00:52:10,665
that's driving us all mad.

1052
00:52:10,932 --> 00:52:14,234
- [audience applause]
- [cheering]

1053
00:52:16,403 --> 00:52:21,542
I am not going to sit here
with this Kentucky fried reject.

1054
00:52:21,576 --> 00:52:24,411
- Tell us how you feel, man.
- This is my town.

1055
00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:27,447
- [audience booing]
- Oh my goodness. What is Ricks doing?

1056
00:52:27,882 --> 00:52:29,383
[crowd chanting]
Drop out, Ricks.

1057
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:30,918
Drop out, Ricks.

1058
00:52:30,952 --> 00:52:35,222
- [bleeping]
- [audience shouting]

1059
00:52:35,255 --> 00:52:37,525
[tone beeping]

1060
00:52:43,263 --> 00:52:44,297
Okay.

1061
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:47,802
I really don't know about
Mr. Thomson's big ideas

1062
00:52:48,402 --> 00:52:51,806
and I don't think they really
concern the Sheriff.

1063
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,942
In fact, I don't think he really
wants to be Sheriff,

1064
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:59,580
but I do, so what I say to you

1065
00:52:59,614 --> 00:53:02,517
is why don't you play your
games somewhere else?

1066
00:53:03,551 --> 00:53:05,218
I think Aspen's ready for it.

1067
00:53:05,687 --> 00:53:07,855
Not only for a new
kind of Sheriff,

1068
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:10,357
but a whole new style
of government,

1069
00:53:10,758 --> 00:53:13,293
the type of thing
Thomas Jefferson had in mind

1070
00:53:13,326 --> 00:53:15,495
when he talked about democracy.

1071
00:53:16,531 --> 00:53:19,834
Citizens having a real hand in
shaping their own destiny.

1072
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,738
And in this era of the automatic
bureaucratic rebuff,

1073
00:53:24,438 --> 00:53:27,542
it may seem radical
or even freaky,

1074
00:53:27,575 --> 00:53:30,745
but it is the concept on which
America was founded.

1075
00:53:32,312 --> 00:53:34,749
- [crowd cheering]
- [clapping]

1076
00:53:43,624 --> 00:53:44,892
[sighs]

1077
00:53:44,926 --> 00:53:47,729
[upbeat rock music]

1078
00:53:47,762 --> 00:53:49,931
[people chattering]

1079
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,674
[Hunter] <i>Pitkin County,
Colorado, was about to elect</i>

1080
00:53:59,707 --> 00:54:01,976
<i>the nation's first
mescaline Sheriff,</i>

1081
00:54:03,376 --> 00:54:05,378
<i>a foul-mouthed, bald-headed
freak who refused</i>

1082
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:07,014
<i>to compromise on
anything at all,</i>

1083
00:54:08,315 --> 00:54:09,717
<i>even his taste for wild drugs</i>

1084
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:12,587
<i>and who didn't mind
saying in public</i>

1085
00:54:12,787 --> 00:54:15,022
<i>that he intended
to hamstring, filet</i>

1086
00:54:15,056 --> 00:54:17,357
<i>and cripple every greedy plot</i>

1087
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,694
<i>the Aspen power structure
held dear.</i>

1088
00:54:22,563 --> 00:54:25,432
You know, it's an isolated town

1089
00:54:25,465 --> 00:54:28,335
with a very unusual kind
of population.

1090
00:54:28,536 --> 00:54:30,470
[people chattering]

1091
00:54:31,338 --> 00:54:34,542
We do have a Freak Power base
and that's undeniable.

1092
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:36,677
- [upbeat music]
- [people chattering]

1093
00:54:38,846 --> 00:54:40,815
We have about 1,000
votes that would,

1094
00:54:40,848 --> 00:54:43,050
if I walked on
the streets naked,

1095
00:54:44,384 --> 00:54:47,320
bomb in each hand,
drugs dripping,

1096
00:54:47,789 --> 00:54:52,026
covered in sticky substances
known to be foul drugs,

1097
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,361
they would still vote for me.

1098
00:54:54,394 --> 00:54:57,031
- [people cheering]
- [upbeat rock music]

1099
00:55:05,873 --> 00:55:09,342
- [laughing]
- [rock music]

1100
00:55:14,682 --> 00:55:16,684
That was brilliant.
Thank you for your time, Dr. Thompson.

1101
00:55:16,717 --> 00:55:18,152
- [Hunter] Appreciate it.
- Good luck.

1102
00:55:18,186 --> 00:55:20,387
- [Hunter] Thank you.
- Hey Hunter, this guy's from <i>Life</i>.

1103
00:55:21,155 --> 00:55:22,089
<i>Life.</i>

1104
00:55:22,123 --> 00:55:24,391
They're thinking about
giving us the cover.

1105
00:55:24,424 --> 00:55:27,427
Nice. All right, <i>Life</i> it is.

1106
00:55:28,863 --> 00:55:29,997
- [knocking]
- [Eve] Come in.

1107
00:55:31,431 --> 00:55:33,968
Glenn, how are you?
Have a drink.

1108
00:55:34,001 --> 00:55:35,636
Oh. Doing well.

1109
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:36,771
Why, thank you.

1110
00:55:37,605 --> 00:55:38,739
Um...

1111
00:55:39,472 --> 00:55:40,473
Glenn?

1112
00:55:41,509 --> 00:55:42,777
You're going to have to drop
out of this race.

1113
00:55:44,612 --> 00:55:46,714
So you've never taken me
seriously this whole time.

1114
00:55:46,747 --> 00:55:48,015
I know you're upset.

1115
00:55:48,049 --> 00:55:49,750
I mean, I understand it.
It's okay.

1116
00:55:49,784 --> 00:55:51,586
You could start a new
life somewhere.

1117
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:53,521
I'm not leaving this town and
I'm not leaving this race.

1118
00:55:53,554 --> 00:55:54,956
You're done Ricks. You're done.

1119
00:55:57,191 --> 00:55:59,560
- [knocking]
- Sit down, Carol.

1120
00:56:01,562 --> 00:56:03,865
- Have an apple.
- [soft music]

1121
00:56:06,868 --> 00:56:07,969
You know what I like about you?

1122
00:56:09,704 --> 00:56:10,671
You're dependable.

1123
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,441
When this whole
crazy election is over,

1124
00:56:14,474 --> 00:56:15,710
can I depend on you to make sure

1125
00:56:15,743 --> 00:56:17,945
this never happens
in our town again?

1126
00:56:19,146 --> 00:56:20,147
Yes, ma'am.

1127
00:56:21,983 --> 00:56:24,552
- Good.
- [soft music]

1128
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,655
[birds chirping]

1129
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,996
[soft, upbeat music]

1130
00:56:35,029 --> 00:56:38,833
You work on "A vote for Ricks
is a vote for Thompson."

1131
00:56:38,866 --> 00:56:41,569
- [woman] Okay.
- How about "The status quo is the way to go."?

1132
00:56:41,602 --> 00:56:44,805
Nothing says you care
like a handwritten note.

1133
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:46,874
Okay, ladies, let's divide up.

1134
00:56:46,908 --> 00:56:48,475
I will take Main Street.

1135
00:56:48,509 --> 00:56:50,077
We're going to go door to door.

1136
00:56:50,111 --> 00:56:51,545
I want you to hand these out.

1137
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:54,015
Don't miss a single person,
understand?

1138
00:56:55,016 --> 00:56:56,117
Great.

1139
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:57,151
Let's do it.

1140
00:56:58,152 --> 00:56:59,153
Door to door.

1141
00:56:59,921 --> 00:57:02,857
And try to be very personal,
right?

1142
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:05,026
You know, ask them how
their kids are doing.

1143
00:57:05,893 --> 00:57:07,962
Tell 'em that their
biscuits smell good.

1144
00:57:08,162 --> 00:57:10,463
[phone ringing]

1145
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:12,166
Watch out for these
questions in here

1146
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:14,101
that ask about
occupation and business.

1147
00:57:14,135 --> 00:57:15,770
It's classic voter intimidation.

1148
00:57:15,803 --> 00:57:17,571
[woman]
<i>Gotta come together on this.</i>

1149
00:57:17,605 --> 00:57:18,906
[woman 2] <i>We need to do whatever it
takes to get rid of Hunter Thompson.</i>

1150
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:21,776
- [woman 3] <i>He is bad news for Aspen.</i>
- Thank you.

1151
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:22,810
Good to see you, Jack.

1152
00:57:25,513 --> 00:57:27,181
[Sandy] Mimeo's broken again.

1153
00:57:27,214 --> 00:57:29,984
Then fix it.
Problems love solutions.

1154
00:57:30,017 --> 00:57:32,086
I'm the only one who does
anything around here.

1155
00:57:32,787 --> 00:57:34,487
Does anyone know how
to fix a Mimeo?

1156
00:57:34,522 --> 00:57:35,589
[Benton] Yeah, I can fix one.

1157
00:57:36,924 --> 00:57:39,560
I think...
Ah, there.

1158
00:57:40,294 --> 00:57:41,796
It was just a little
constipated.

1159
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:43,496
All right. Anything else?

1160
00:57:43,764 --> 00:57:45,967
Yeah. Where is Hunter?

1161
00:57:46,867 --> 00:57:48,970
[Hunter] Muhammad Ali
didn't think it was fair

1162
00:57:49,003 --> 00:57:51,038
that he needed to go
fight a war

1163
00:57:51,072 --> 00:57:52,974
against the Vietcong
who had never

1164
00:57:53,007 --> 00:57:54,508
done anything wrong to him.

1165
00:57:55,076 --> 00:57:58,946
So he went to jail and
he didn't fight for three years.

1166
00:57:59,246 --> 00:58:01,182
Now this is his comeback fight.

1167
00:58:01,215 --> 00:58:02,917
[woman] <i>We're making
a coalition...</i>

1168
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,719
[woman 2] <i>Democrats and
Republicans are teamin' up.</i>

1169
00:58:04,752 --> 00:58:05,886
[woman 3]
<i>We have to save our town.</i>

1170
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,621
[woman 4] <i>Republican party
is droppin' Ricks.</i>

1171
00:58:07,888 --> 00:58:10,825
Vote Whitmire.
Tell Jim to vote Whitmire.

1172
00:58:10,858 --> 00:58:12,059
Vote Whitmire.

1173
00:58:12,093 --> 00:58:13,694
[Hunter] Oh, see that right?

1174
00:58:13,728 --> 00:58:14,862
That's what they call
a counter punch.

1175
00:58:14,895 --> 00:58:16,897
That's when someone
tries to punch you

1176
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:19,100
and instead of letting
them hit you,

1177
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:21,268
you dodge the punch and
you hit 'em back. Counter.

1178
00:58:21,736 --> 00:58:24,171
Vote Whitmire. You know that.
Don't have to tell you.

1179
00:58:24,205 --> 00:58:26,540
Oh hey, Jennifer, look at you.

1180
00:58:26,941 --> 00:58:29,744
No below the belt. [laughs]

1181
00:58:29,777 --> 00:58:31,979
- [both laugh]
- That was legal.

1182
00:58:32,013 --> 00:58:33,581
Good to see ya, Sue.

1183
00:58:36,784 --> 00:58:39,787
[people chattering]

1184
00:58:42,023 --> 00:58:44,025
[Peggy] Okay, listen up,
listen up, listen up.

1185
00:58:44,792 --> 00:58:47,995
I... I've just learned that Ricks
is being dropped.

1186
00:58:48,963 --> 00:58:50,998
That means this isn't
a three-way race anymore.

1187
00:58:51,766 --> 00:58:53,801
The fucking Democrats
and Republicans

1188
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:55,102
are teaming up against us.

1189
00:58:56,303 --> 00:58:59,907
So if we stand a chance of
beating those hypocrites now,

1190
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,676
we need every single last
one of our voters,

1191
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:07,281
which means our get out the vote
operation starts before dawn.

1192
00:59:07,314 --> 00:59:08,315
So please...

1193
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,319
Finish your drinks and go home.
We got a big day tomorrow.

1194
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:19,760
We better get to work.

1195
00:59:21,128 --> 00:59:22,329
I'm gonna go home, okay?

1196
00:59:23,664 --> 00:59:24,665
Hunter.

1197
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,701
It's the last hour.

1198
00:59:27,735 --> 00:59:30,104
[tense music]

1199
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,309
[Hunter] <i>The race was going
to be very close.</i>

1200
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:38,846
<i>After a savage fire-sucking
campaign,</i>

1201
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,782
<i>the major parties forged
an unholy alliance</i>

1202
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:45,886
<i>and expected me to hunker down</i>

1203
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,189
<i>like a natural gentlemen
and take a beating.</i>

1204
00:59:49,824 --> 00:59:52,359
<i>But the '60s were full of
examples of good men</i>

1205
00:59:52,393 --> 00:59:55,696
<i>challenging the establishment
and being assassinated</i>

1206
00:59:55,729 --> 00:59:58,065
<i>under
mysterious circumstances.</i>

1207
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:02,636
[soft acoustic music]

1208
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:05,072
[Hunter] <i>Rumor was we'd be
attacked by a lone gunman</i>

1209
01:00:05,106 --> 01:00:08,275
<i>or the Hell's Angels or
a posse of firefighters</i>

1210
01:00:08,309 --> 01:00:10,744
<i>and construction workers
or wolverines.</i>

1211
01:00:11,779 --> 01:00:14,348
<i>I know the rumors because
I started them.</i>

1212
01:00:21,255 --> 01:00:24,125
[people shouting]

1213
01:00:26,794 --> 01:00:29,230
- [cheering]
- [shouting]

1214
01:00:30,431 --> 01:00:32,900
We might not be the law yet,

1215
01:00:33,868 --> 01:00:35,236
but we are not to be
fucked with.

1216
01:00:35,269 --> 01:00:39,140
- [cheering]
- All right, so, if they try to fuck with us Freaks,

1217
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:42,810
then they suffer the consequences
that are due to them.

1218
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:48,949
[Hunter] <i>Tomorrow morning, Aspen's

1220
01:00:52,453 --> 01:00:55,422
<i>As it spills out
onto the streets</i>

1221
01:00:55,456 --> 01:01:01,295

1222

1223
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:05,032

1225
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:17,178
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1226

Saddle up freaks!

- Ride 'em up!

[Benton] <i>All right, everybody.</i>

1233
01:01:58,219 --> 01:02:00,454
Here we go, this is it.
Today is the day.

1234
01:02:00,487 --> 01:02:03,390
Each one of you is
assigned to a precinct.

1235
01:02:03,424 --> 01:02:06,126
We are recording every moment,
any challenge.

1236
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,195
<i>This is American history
that we're making.</i>

1237
01:02:08,229 --> 01:02:09,463
You hold on to the mescaline.

1238
01:02:09,496 --> 01:02:10,831
Don't drink it.

1239
01:02:11,065 --> 01:02:12,066
Discard it.

1240
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:14,134
[music continues]

1241
01:02:17,438 --> 01:02:19,039
Who are these people?

1242
01:02:19,073 --> 01:02:21,308
I don't know, but they either
have too many drugs

1243
01:02:21,342 --> 01:02:23,911
- or not enough.
- [crowd shouting]

1244
01:02:33,821 --> 01:02:36,390
[Eve] For heaven's sakes,
this is ridiculous.

1245
01:02:37,291 --> 01:02:38,792
What the hell is going on?

1246
01:02:38,826 --> 01:02:40,794
I don't know.
They got here before we did.

1247
01:02:41,128 --> 01:02:42,863
Hey Mayor, hey Sheriff.

1248
01:02:43,163 --> 01:02:44,865
- Did you see the voters out front?
- Yeah.

1249
01:02:44,898 --> 01:02:46,133
[man] Were they friendly?

1250
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:48,102
She doesn't look like she's 21.

1251
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:50,471
Excuse me, young lady.

1252
01:02:50,505 --> 01:02:52,540
You know you have to
be 21 to vote

1253
01:02:52,574 --> 01:02:54,241
and you know what
happens if you lie?

1254
01:02:54,576 --> 01:02:56,143
I know the damn law.

1255
01:02:56,176 --> 01:02:57,211
Get out of my way.

1256
01:02:58,178 --> 01:02:59,480
You're not gonna
call for backup?

1257
01:03:00,481 --> 01:03:01,915
You have a good day.

1258
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,119
I just want to ensure that we
have a free and fair election.

1259
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:08,255
Yes. This has been a very
exciting election in Aspen.

1260
01:03:13,193 --> 01:03:15,329
I like Hunter Thompson,
I think he's a good man.

1261
01:03:15,362 --> 01:03:17,498
I really do. I think he's got
some real far out ideas.

1262
01:03:18,032 --> 01:03:19,567
I happened to vote for uh,
Thompson,

1263
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,070
because, I don't know,
I'd like to see

1264
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:26,173
justice done equally
to the rich and the poor.

1265
01:03:26,206 --> 01:03:27,609
At least they have
some new ideas,

1266
01:03:27,642 --> 01:03:29,843
which is more than
the old people have.

1267
01:03:30,978 --> 01:03:33,280
[Hunter] <i>In truth, we are not
really freaks at all,</i>

1268
01:03:33,314 --> 01:03:36,584
<i>not in the literal sense
but the twisted realities</i>

1269
01:03:36,618 --> 01:03:38,852
<i>of the world
we are trying to live in</i>

1270
01:03:38,886 --> 01:03:41,455
<i>have somehow combined to make
us feel like freaks.</i>

1271
01:03:41,955 --> 01:03:46,060
<i>We argue, we protest, we
petition, but nothing changes.</i>

1272
01:03:46,093 --> 01:03:48,128
<i>So now with
the rest of the nation</i>

1273
01:03:48,162 --> 01:03:51,899
<i>erupting in a firestorm of
bombings and political killing,</i>

1274
01:03:51,932 --> 01:03:54,935
<i>a handful of freaks are
running a final,</i>

1275
01:03:54,968 --> 01:03:57,338
<i>perhaps atavistic
experiment with the idea</i>

1276
01:03:57,371 --> 01:03:59,106
<i>of forcing change by voting.</i>

1277
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,475
Now that they see that
we're doing that,

1278
01:04:01,509 --> 01:04:03,344
we're registering to vote,
we are voting,

1279
01:04:03,377 --> 01:04:05,145
we're running our
own candidates,

1280
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:07,549
oh my God, it's a horror and
they're trying to stop it

1281
01:04:07,582 --> 01:04:09,049
because we're liable to
take it over.

1282
01:04:09,551 --> 01:04:13,621
Hunter Thompson is a socialist.

1283
01:04:13,655 --> 01:04:15,255
Save our town.

1284
01:04:15,289 --> 01:04:17,559
Vote for law and order.

1285
01:04:17,592 --> 01:04:20,562
Let's get the long-hairs out of
here once and for all.

1286
01:04:22,363 --> 01:04:23,364
[Hunter] <i>Deb.</i>

1287
01:04:23,964 --> 01:04:25,199
Debs.

1288
01:04:25,232 --> 01:04:28,068
They're fucking with our
voters at ward two.

1289
01:04:28,102 --> 01:04:29,571
You head to ward 12.

1290
01:04:29,604 --> 01:04:31,338
There won't be no intimidation!

1291
01:04:31,372 --> 01:04:32,272
No intimidation!

1292
01:04:32,306 --> 01:04:33,941
- [Hunter] Okay?
- [Deb] Let's get these...

1293
01:04:33,974 --> 01:04:35,109
- [Hunter] Handle it!
- [Deb] Yeah!

1294
01:04:35,142 --> 01:04:36,443
[Hunter] Maximum savagery!

1295
01:04:36,477 --> 01:04:38,379
Okay, all right,
if you're not on a telephone

1296
01:04:38,412 --> 01:04:41,482
in your hand right now, get out
of here, hit the streets.

1297
01:04:41,516 --> 01:04:44,519
There are shacks, lodges,
communes, hovels

1298
01:04:44,552 --> 01:04:47,254
<i>that don't have any phones
but they do have voters.</i>

1299
01:04:47,287 --> 01:04:49,923
The moment is now people.
Get out there.

1300
01:04:49,957 --> 01:04:51,626
Citizens, the two party system

1301
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:53,561
is the lie that is
killing America.

1302
01:04:53,595 --> 01:04:56,463
Rise up, permit
no jack-boot thuggery.

1303
01:04:57,097 --> 01:04:59,233
Young Wood,
take this tranquilizer gun.

1304
01:04:59,266 --> 01:05:01,335
Load it and get it ready.

1305
01:05:01,368 --> 01:05:03,070
The condition of society

1306
01:05:03,103 --> 01:05:04,471
is proof of your
criminal negligence

1307
01:05:04,506 --> 01:05:06,173
but you won't be long
for this world.

1308
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:08,142
That lunatic is refusing to let

1309
01:05:08,175 --> 01:05:09,943
that 75-year-old woman
cast her ballot

1310
01:05:09,977 --> 01:05:11,646
until she shows him her
birth certificate.

1311
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,981
- [Mike] What?
- Fuck. Man, come on.

1312
01:05:14,014 --> 01:05:15,015
Jesus.

1313
01:05:15,983 --> 01:05:17,050
[Mike] I didn't think it'd
turn into this.

1314
01:05:17,084 --> 01:05:18,952
[Hunter] Oh man, we need to
physically remove him.

1315
01:05:18,986 --> 01:05:20,120
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1316
01:05:20,154 --> 01:05:21,321
- You're a fuckin' mess.
- Jesus.

1317
01:05:21,355 --> 01:05:23,691
Hey look, your zeal is inspiring

1318
01:05:23,725 --> 01:05:25,192
but we're going to have
to replace you.

1319
01:05:25,225 --> 01:05:26,528
It's for the best interest.

1320
01:05:26,561 --> 01:05:27,662
- Wood...
- [tranquilizer fires]

1321
01:05:27,695 --> 01:05:29,163
Oh! Why did you do that?

1322
01:05:29,196 --> 01:05:30,264
You nodded at me to shoot him!

1323
01:05:31,498 --> 01:05:33,434
No! I told you to replace as
the fucking poll-watcher, man.

1324
01:05:33,467 --> 01:05:34,968
- Yeah, man.
- Come on.

1325
01:05:35,002 --> 01:05:36,303
Get him in the back.

1326
01:05:36,336 --> 01:05:37,672
Yeah. Get in there.

1327
01:05:40,007 --> 01:05:42,276
Replace the poll-watcher, Wood.

1328
01:05:45,647 --> 01:05:46,681
- Fuckin' hell.
- [Mike] Oh, shit there's...

1329
01:05:46,714 --> 01:05:49,383
[Hunter] Oh man, and now
the fuckin' pigs are here.

1330
01:05:50,117 --> 01:05:52,186
Damn. Oink, oink.

1331
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,055
Shut the fuck up, man,
or you'll be in trouble.

1332
01:05:55,523 --> 01:05:57,124
- All right.
- Stay in the vehicle, Hunter.

1333
01:05:57,157 --> 01:05:58,959
Shut the door.
Stay in the vehicle.

1334
01:05:59,661 --> 01:06:01,028
I don't know why
I'm being pulled over.

1335
01:06:01,061 --> 01:06:04,398
All I know is that you can pull
someone over if you suspect a crime.

1336
01:06:04,431 --> 01:06:06,534
You can't pull me over
hoping to find one.

1337
01:06:07,434 --> 01:06:09,236
I got one question.
Have you been drinking, Hunter?

1338
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:12,439
Maybe mescaline, but you'd have
a hard time proving that.

1339
01:06:12,473 --> 01:06:14,041
You'd be surprised.

1340
01:06:14,074 --> 01:06:15,409
- Mike it's not funny.
- [laughing]

1341
01:06:15,442 --> 01:06:16,644
Who's the guy in the backseat?

1342
01:06:16,678 --> 01:06:18,580
Oh, this is our friend.

1343
01:06:18,613 --> 01:06:20,013
He's a poet, Alan Ginsburg.

1344
01:06:20,582 --> 01:06:21,683
Never heard of him.

1345
01:06:22,817 --> 01:06:24,084
Mr. Ginsburg why don't you step
out of the vehicle?

1346
01:06:26,186 --> 01:06:27,154
Oh, here we go.

1347
01:06:27,187 --> 01:06:28,623
[Sheriff Whitmire]
Yeah, here we go, Hunter.

1348
01:06:29,089 --> 01:06:31,358
Come on, Alan. Let's give
the Sheriff an oratory.

1349
01:06:32,292 --> 01:06:33,293
Oh, yeah.

1350
01:06:36,497 --> 01:06:37,765
[Hunter grunts]

1351
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,668
What, is this guy trippin'?
He's just hopped up?

1352
01:06:43,505 --> 01:06:45,507
[screams]

1353
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,675
Where the hell is he goin'?

1354
01:06:47,709 --> 01:06:51,111
You know, I... I don't think that
was Alan Ginsburg after all.

1355
01:06:51,144 --> 01:06:52,547
[Sheriff Whitmire]
Are you not gonna help this man?

1356
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:54,381
He's running around like
a crazy chicken.

1357
01:06:54,414 --> 01:06:55,783
He's your friend.

1358
01:06:55,817 --> 01:06:58,352
You know, he was a con man,
I'm sure of it.

1359
01:06:59,286 --> 01:07:00,655
Good work.

1360
01:07:00,688 --> 01:07:01,789
Mr. Ginsburg!

1361
01:07:01,823 --> 01:07:03,357
[Hunter and Mike laughing]

1362
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:05,125
[Mike] At least we got rid of
that lunatic.

1363
01:07:05,158 --> 01:07:06,493
- [Hunter] Pigs.
- Two birds with one stone.

1364
01:07:06,528 --> 01:07:07,629
[Sheriff Whitmire]
Alan Ginsburg!

1365
01:07:08,395 --> 01:07:09,396
Alan!

1366
01:07:10,264 --> 01:07:11,465
Oh, hell.

1367
01:07:11,498 --> 01:07:12,734
That's probably not
even his name.

1368
01:07:16,704 --> 01:07:19,439
[Peggy] <i>All right, we've
cached 600 of our voters.</i>

1369
01:07:19,473 --> 01:07:22,175
That means we have at least
150 of our Freaks

1370
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:23,711
who have not made it
to the polls yet,

1371
01:07:23,878 --> 01:07:25,647
and they close in two hours,
people.

1372
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,715
We need to scour
the park benches

1373
01:07:27,749 --> 01:07:29,717
or we will lose this thing.

1374
01:07:29,751 --> 01:07:33,420
Time to rouse the stragglers
with a blizzard of enthusiasm.

1375
01:07:33,453 --> 01:07:35,723
[people chattering]

1376
01:07:35,757 --> 01:07:37,357
This is Hunter S. Thompson
and I was wondering

1377
01:07:37,391 --> 01:07:39,393
if you were gonna get out
and vote today?

1378
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:41,596
Um...

1379
01:07:41,629 --> 01:07:43,130
Yes.

1380
01:07:43,163 --> 01:07:45,299
The freaky one.
That would be me.

1381
01:07:45,733 --> 01:07:48,101
Well, that's very disappointing.

1382
01:07:48,135 --> 01:07:50,370
- [people chattering]
- [phones ringing]

1383
01:07:51,405 --> 01:07:53,775
[Hunter]
Mike will be making some grub.

1384
01:07:53,808 --> 01:07:57,545
There'll be satchels of brain
rattling drugs for everybody

1385
01:07:57,579 --> 01:08:00,113
who wants to end this
on a high note.

1386
01:08:00,147 --> 01:08:01,816
[crowd cheering]

1387
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:02,951
[Peggy] Okay, okay, okay.

1388
01:08:02,984 --> 01:08:05,620
There will be a party but please
keep working for now.

1389
01:08:05,653 --> 01:08:08,488
I want you working
like coal miners

1390
01:08:08,656 --> 01:08:11,258
at a cave-in! [chuckles]

1391
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:13,160
- [phones ringing]
- [typewriters clacking]

1392
01:08:13,493 --> 01:08:15,262
Hey.
What are you guys doing here?

1393
01:08:16,831 --> 01:08:18,533
[Sandy] We came to see you. See how
things are going. Have you voted yet?

1394
01:08:18,566 --> 01:08:20,635
- Voted?
- The polls close soon.

1395
01:08:20,668 --> 01:08:21,669
Vote. I have to vote.

1396
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:24,839
Come on, Juan, let's go exercise
out constitutional rights.

1397
01:08:24,872 --> 01:08:26,273
I'm driving.

1398
01:08:26,306 --> 01:08:27,642
Okay. Good idea.

1399
01:08:27,675 --> 01:08:29,309
Someone take my cattle prod.

1400
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:31,278
I'm going to vote.

1401
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:36,684
Have you been to the polls yet
this afternoon, sir?

1402
01:08:36,718 --> 01:08:38,285
All right, we're down to
the last two hours.

1403
01:08:38,318 --> 01:08:39,621
You're going to have to
leave work early

1404
01:08:39,654 --> 01:08:41,154
if you want your vote to count.

1405
01:08:41,589 --> 01:08:43,290
All right.
Thank you very much.

1406
01:08:43,323 --> 01:08:44,358
Thanks for your support.

1407
01:08:46,493 --> 01:08:47,494
[Juan]
You don't even have any hair.

1408
01:08:47,528 --> 01:08:49,463
I mean you had the craziest
hair in the world.

1409
01:08:49,496 --> 01:08:50,932
[Hunter chuckles]

1410
01:08:50,965 --> 01:08:52,667
This might be our next Sheriff,
right there.

1411
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,202
Hey.
Juan, this is the poll-watcher.

1412
01:08:55,235 --> 01:08:58,271
She will be making sure there's
no corruption happening.

1413
01:08:58,305 --> 01:08:59,774
- How are we doing?
- About even.

1414
01:08:59,807 --> 01:09:01,009
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1415
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:02,877
- You are?
- Excellent. You hear that Juan? We're even.

1416
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:03,945
- He is.
- Let's go vote.

1417
01:09:03,978 --> 01:09:05,312
Good luck, Hunter.

1418
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:08,516
All right, buddy.
We need some privacy.

1419
01:09:09,316 --> 01:09:11,318
- Here we go.
- I know which one to take.

1420
01:09:11,351 --> 01:09:13,554
No. First we need to vote.

1421
01:09:14,388 --> 01:09:15,623
So who are we gonna vote for?

1422
01:09:15,657 --> 01:09:16,891
We've got Ricks.

1423
01:09:17,959 --> 01:09:19,527
What do you think about Ricks?

1424
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,630
- [Juan grumbles]
- What about Whitmire? Whitmire?

1425
01:09:22,664 --> 01:09:26,433
- [Juan grumbles]
- What about Hunter Thompson?

1426
01:09:26,466 --> 01:09:27,935
- Is that the one?
- Yeah.

1427
01:09:27,969 --> 01:09:29,937
- All right, let's vote for him.
- But Whitmire I'll steal a cupcake from.

1428
01:09:29,971 --> 01:09:32,507
[Hunter]
All right, perfect. Here we go.

1429
01:09:34,842 --> 01:09:36,577
- Voting sticker, buddy.
- Ow.

1430
01:09:36,844 --> 01:09:38,478
- [Juan mumbles]
- [Hunter sighs]

1431
01:09:39,714 --> 01:09:41,616
In the end,
we're not all that different.

1432
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:45,352
[Hunter and Juan oinking]

1433
01:09:46,788 --> 01:09:49,289
[Juan speaking indistinctly]

1434
01:09:52,325 --> 01:09:54,529
[Peggy]
<i>Okay everyone, phones down.</i>

1435
01:09:54,729 --> 01:09:56,931
The polls are now closed.

1436
01:09:56,964 --> 01:09:59,734
All right. Thank you all so much
for your hard work.

1437
01:09:59,767 --> 01:10:02,235
What's done is done.
Now we wait.

1438
01:10:02,269 --> 01:10:04,939
So let the party commence.

1439
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:07,942
- [people cheering]
- Thank you.

1440
01:10:07,975 --> 01:10:10,343
Let's head to the bar!
[indistinct]

1441
01:10:12,345 --> 01:10:14,582
[people cheering]

1442
01:10:17,985 --> 01:10:19,419
Oh.

1443
01:10:19,453 --> 01:10:21,756
You realize that we are
actually gonna win big.

1444
01:10:21,789 --> 01:10:23,591
Feel this, we're gonna win big!

1445
01:10:24,357 --> 01:10:26,627
If we win it'll be by
less than 25 votes.

1446
01:10:26,928 --> 01:10:28,563
Politics is addictive.

1447
01:10:28,596 --> 01:10:32,667
We must be very careful not to
show any signs of addiction.

1448
01:10:32,867 --> 01:10:35,937
I think right now, Hunter, what you
need is another sip of the mescaline.

1449
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:37,404
I do.

1450
01:10:37,437 --> 01:10:39,306
That is not what
he needs right now.

1451
01:10:41,709 --> 01:10:42,944
Feels good.

1452
01:10:43,578 --> 01:10:45,412
Yeah, they believe
we're gonna win.

1453
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:48,816
They believe this is
the start of a movement.

1454
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:51,451
They believe in you, Hunter.

1455
01:10:53,353 --> 01:10:54,555
You gotta decide if
you want them

1456
01:10:54,589 --> 01:10:58,726
to remember you
for all this or for this.

1457
01:10:59,326 --> 01:11:01,829
Yeah, but if it wasn't for this,
I'd be an accountant.

1458
01:11:01,863 --> 01:11:03,396
- Oh, come on.
- But it's true.

1459
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:05,700
Say it enough and you might
end up believing it.

1460
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,735
Well, I'm gonna go to my room.

1461
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:12,039
This is worse than waiting
around in the maternity ward.

1462
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,609
All right, we'll come get
you when you win.

1463
01:11:15,843 --> 01:11:16,844
Sheriff.

1464
01:11:17,812 --> 01:11:20,782

- [door slams]
- [Benton] Hunter, man, you gotta get out here, man.

1466
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,056
- [Hunter] Shut up!
- [Benton] You gotta get out here.

1467
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:30,992
- Come on!
- [woman] Come on, Hunter!

1468
01:11:31,025 --> 01:11:32,560

campaign in '72.</i>

01:11:46,808 --> 01:11:49,442
<i>They seem to think that
I could beat Nixon handily</i>

1473
01:11:49,476 --> 01:11:51,879
<i>with the same kind of
campaign we ran here.</i>

1474

You gotta get out here, man!

<i>running on
a Freak Power platform,</i>

01:12:05,993 --> 01:12:08,729
<i>then the vote might still
be a viable tool,</i>

1479
01:12:09,797 --> 01:12:11,699
<i>and it might still be

1480

it doesn't look good.

Anyway, they won't have
Hunter S. Thompson

01:14:41,582 --> 01:14:43,184
to kick around anymore.

1515
01:14:43,751 --> 01:14:44,919
[man] This is bullshit!

1516
01:14:45,152 --> 01:14:46,253
[Hunter] No I wouldn't...

1517
01:14:46,287 --> 01:14:47,855
Politics, you know?

1518
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:50,558
[man 2] What do you
think you proved?

1519
01:14:52,193 --> 01:14:55,062
I think, um,
I unfortunately proved

1520
01:14:55,096 --> 01:14:57,064
what I set out to prove,

1521
01:14:57,665 --> 01:15:01,135
which is that um,
[laughs] you know,

1522
01:15:01,168 --> 01:15:04,739
the American dream
really is fucked.

1523
01:15:04,772 --> 01:15:05,906
No, it's not.

1524
01:15:07,641 --> 01:15:08,909
[Hunter]
Maybe I didn't prove that.

1525
01:15:09,677 --> 01:15:11,679
Maybe I just proved, you know,

1526
01:15:11,712 --> 01:15:13,881
there's no place in politics

1527
01:15:14,248 --> 01:15:18,319
for a baldheaded lunatic, right?

1528
01:15:18,352 --> 01:15:20,888
[film reel rolling]

1529
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:24,959
[Hunter sighs]

1530
01:15:26,694 --> 01:15:28,295
We ran the county line

1531
01:15:30,164 --> 01:15:37,038
between the necessity for
winning and the weird possibility

1532
01:15:37,638 --> 01:15:41,175
that we could win
on our own terms.

1533
01:15:43,911 --> 01:15:48,282
And that alone has made
this campaign

1534
01:15:48,315 --> 01:15:50,117
worth all of the effort.

1535
01:15:50,785 --> 01:15:51,786
All the effort.

1536
01:15:55,723 --> 01:15:58,826
I won't dwell on the past

1537
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:02,663
but just to say that

1538
01:16:03,931 --> 01:16:06,934
this is the best piece of advice
I'll ever give you:

1539
01:16:08,636 --> 01:16:12,006
if you ever get
a chance to sweep

1540
01:16:12,039 --> 01:16:13,774
the fat backs off their feet,

1541
01:16:16,644 --> 01:16:17,711
[sighs]

1542
01:16:19,246 --> 01:16:22,216
- don't fuck it up.
- [soft music]

1543
01:16:25,953 --> 01:16:28,956
- [cheering]
- [clapping]

1544
01:16:28,989 --> 01:16:30,291
[bottle pops]

1545
01:16:30,758 --> 01:16:32,693
[cheering]

1546
01:16:32,726 --> 01:16:34,395
We won, we won, we won!

1547
01:16:34,428 --> 01:16:36,664
[Hunter] <i>In a democracy,
people usually get</i>

1548
01:16:36,997 --> 01:16:38,299
<i>the kind of
government they deserve</i>

1549
01:16:38,332 --> 01:16:40,067
<i>and they deserve
what they get.</i>

1550
01:16:40,201 --> 01:16:42,036
[Eve] We love this town!

1551
01:16:42,069 --> 01:16:44,638
[man] <i>Winning this election,
party lines didn't really</i>

1552
01:16:44,672 --> 01:16:46,073
mean much in this county.

1553
01:16:46,107 --> 01:16:49,110
We realized that laws,
we must have laws,

1554
01:16:49,143 --> 01:16:51,245
and we've got to obey these laws

1555
01:16:51,278 --> 01:16:53,214
and without laws
we've got anarchy.

1556
01:16:53,714 --> 01:16:55,649
- To Aspen.
- To Aspen.

1557
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,652
[Hunter]
<i>The day after the polls close,</i>

1558
01:16:58,686 --> 01:17:01,222
<i>you can understand
why Cinderella</i>

1559
01:17:01,255 --> 01:17:02,923
<i>never stayed out
after midnight.</i>

1560
01:17:05,259 --> 01:17:08,129
<i>Politics is the art of
controlling your environment.</i>

1561
01:17:10,231 --> 01:17:12,299
<i>That is one of the key things
I learned in these years</i>

1562
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:13,934
<i>and I learned it the hard way.</i>

1563
01:17:15,202 --> 01:17:16,203
Yeah!

1564
01:17:17,606 --> 01:17:18,672
<i>Anybody who thinks that it
doesn't matter who's president</i>

1565
01:17:18,706 --> 01:17:21,108
<i>has never been sent off
to fight and die</i>

1566
01:17:21,142 --> 01:17:23,944
<i>in a vicious, stupid war on
the other side of the world,</i>

1567
01:17:25,112 --> 01:17:27,281
<i>or been beaten and
gassed by police</i>

1568
01:17:27,314 --> 01:17:29,350
<i>for trespassing on
public property,</i>

1569
01:17:30,217 --> 01:17:33,387
<i>or been hounded by the IRS for
purely political reasons,</i>

1570
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:35,322
<i>or locked up in
the Cook County jail</i>

1571
01:17:35,356 --> 01:17:37,925
<i>with a broken nose and
no phone access</i>

1572
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:40,761
<i>and 12 perverts waiting to
stomp your ass in the shower.</i>

1573
01:17:41,128 --> 01:17:42,897
<i>That is when it matters
who is president</i>

1574
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:44,932
<i>or governor or Sheriff.</i>

1575
01:17:45,766 --> 01:17:48,435
<i>That is when you wish
you had voted.</i>

1576
