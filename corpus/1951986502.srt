1
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:30,623
SWING VOTE

2
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,376
<i>After a hotly contested race,</i>
<i>Americans go to the polls today...</i>

3
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,257
<i>in what promises to be</i>
<i>a very close election.</i>

4
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,182
<i>The Republican Andrew Boone,</i>
<i>hoping to hold on to the Oval Office...</i>

5
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,518
<i>by edging out...</i>

6
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,831
<i>the Democratic challenger</i>
<i>Donald Greenleaf.</i>

7
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,456
Bud... Bud.

8
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,519
Bud!

9
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,007
I'll call...
I'll call him back.

10
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,600
If we had a phone, you could.
Come on!

11
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,900
Goddamnit! It's cold.

12
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,876
We're gonna be late again.
You need a shower.

13
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,871
Can't believe
you slept in your clothes!

14
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,849
Leave me any hot water?

15
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,389
I don't know.
Water heater fix itself?

16
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,757
Christ, Molly! Why don't you
just take the day off, okay?

17
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,430
I'll write you a note.

18
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,474
Now!
I'm not going to tell you again!

19
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,440
Get up!

20
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:35,849
<i>Bud!</i>

21
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,384
Alright, I'm coming!

22
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,018
- What?
- Egg salad.

23
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:17,757
Again?

24
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:19,930
You like egg salad.

25
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:24,527
Well, not every damn day I don't.
You could mix it up a little.

26
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:25,829
We're on a budget.

27
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,707
You wanna eat better?
Drink less beer.

28
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,073
- Fine.
- Fine.

29
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:38,381
- And don't forget today.
- What's... what's today?

30
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,283
Election day, dummy!

31
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,545
I'm supposed to do a report
on you voting, remember?

32
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,421
I already told you before
I'm not even registered.

33
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,877
I registered for you
in the mail.

34
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,864
That's great,
I could get jury duty now.

35
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,296
- It's your civic responsibility.
- It's my civic, my what?

36
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,163
It's your civic responsibility.

37
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,832
My civic responsibility?
Where you learning this crap?

38
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,404
Mrs. Abernathy.

39
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,770
Well, stay away from her.

40
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,540
She's my teacher.

41
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,102
Sign this.

42
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,769
What is it?

43
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,541
A questionnaire. I'm supposed
to ask you about your politics.

44
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,643
Well, go ahead.

45
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,809
I already filled it in.

46
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,551
I wanted you to sound smart.

47
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,924
Give me
the first question anyway.

48
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,324
What's your political affiliation?

49
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,559
Alright,
I'm a conscious objector.

50
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:09,360
It's not a war, Bud. It's an election.
And you are an independent.

51
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,902
Independent? Why in the hell
would I be an independent?

52
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,868
Because the two party system...

53
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,907
has neglected the needs
of the working poor.

54
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,808
- Let me tell you something, baby...
- Here we go again.

55
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,380
The voting doesn't count
for a goddamn thing.

56
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,388
Just a way to make you feel
like you're in control of something.

57
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:33,022
It doesn't matter who you vote for,
we can't afford insurance and...

58
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:37,093
if you get sick, I'm gonna have
to start selling my blood again.

59
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:41,058
Mrs. Abernathy said every vote counts.
It's a social contract.

60
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:45,704
It's a social contract.
This Mrs. Abernathy is full of shit.

61
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,431
Meet me at the polling place
after work.

62
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:08,793
Fine.

63
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,200
You forgetting something?

64
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:22,212
Bud, screw this up
and I'm leaving you.

65
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:28,884
Do good!

66
00:06:59,018 --> 00:06:59,575
Where...

67
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,114
Where the hell is Dewey?

68
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,383
He got laid off.

69
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,949
Bullshit! He got insourced.

70
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:09,862
Insourced?

71
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,862
Insourced. Instead of exporting
our jobs to Mexico...

72
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,628
they're importing Mexicans
to take our jobs.

73
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,694
You're paranoid,
you know that?

74
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:23,669
<i>Attention! The opening</i>
<i>this morning is officially cancelled.</i>

75
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,546
I can't even read
the damn signs no more!

76
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,444
Our days are numbered, fellas.
You mark my words!

77
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,117
These hombres work twice
as hard for half the money.

78
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,517
I just figure they need this job
twice as bad as us!

79
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,587
Whose side are you on?

80
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:46,822
I don't take sides, Lowell.
Just stating the obvious.

81
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,202
Next thing, they'll be taking
away our right to vote.

82
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,136
You voting, Bud?

83
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,866
It's a social contract,
isn't it?

84
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,601
Who are you voting for?

85
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,945
Shit if I know!

86
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:10,883
I think I picked up a couple shades.
Looks like an eight.

87
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,147
What do you think, Marty?

88
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,390
I don't like
the margin in Florida.

89
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:19,224
Bus some young Republicans down
to the polling stations in Palm Beach.

90
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:23,868
Make sure they're tall,
they're blonde and they're men.

91
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,104
Because old Jews see a pack
of angry young white males...

92
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,938
and they're gonna think twice
about getting out of their car!

93
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,172
Kennedy was a nine.
And he put a man on the moon.

94
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,104
That's what we need.
Something to shoot for.

95
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:46,421
A defining moment.
Like... I don't know.

96
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,721
Cure for cancer.

97
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,520
Ohio run the gay marriage
ad every twenty minutes.

98
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,926
Let's see if we can't get those God
fearing bastards off the fence.

99
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,499
We take a bunch of scientists,
put them in the desert somewhere.

100
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,094
Like the Manhattan project. Are you
listening to me? I'm serious about this.

101
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,899
I think that cancer is going to be
a tough nut to crack in one term, sir.

102
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,280
So, we make it a ten year plan.

103
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,881
- Lincoln got to see the end of slavery?
- No.

104
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,343
- Did Kennedy get to see the moon shot?
- Nope.

105
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:19,617
No! But they got the credit!
It's the idea that counts.

106
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,819
The guy that sets the goal
gets in the history books!

107
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:27,187
Hope and positivity! Marty,
the American people want a bright...

108
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:30,657
shining smile to represent
the promise of this country.

109
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,601
Take old Georgie there.

110
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,135
Boy, he was off the charts.

111
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,809
They wanted to make him King.

112
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,247
Son of a gun!

113
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,661
Thank you,
thank you for coming.

114
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:05,533
Galena and I would like
to thank America...

115
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,133
for this glorious opportunity.

116
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:12,233
I have met people of every race,
color and creed...

117
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,108
during this long campaign.

118
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,273
I pledge to you that my White House
will be a rainbow house.

119
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,479
It'll be open to people
of all colors and creeds.

120
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,355
Now, please, go and vote.
We need your support.

121
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,556
That was great.
I'm gonna go do press.

122
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:34,188
Great.

123
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:42,936
Greenleaf! Greenleaf!

124
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,705
Gallup has you down by a point.

125
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:49,874
CNN, USA Today, has us up by two.
News has us down by sixty.

126
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,247
What message are you trying
to get out to the undecideds today?

127
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,640
The same message we put out yesterday,
last week and last year...

128
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,215
when we started this campaign
and that's why we're going to win.

129
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:02,018
Because we have the answers.
Not platitudes and jingoistic rhetoric.

130
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,754
This is the truth
train operation real deal.

131
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,425
In recent days, the president
has aired ads claiming Greenleaf...

132
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,322
has vacationed
at a nudist colony.

133
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,032
Come on, now, that's a tired
accusation. It's pure fiction.

134
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,800
- Then, how do you answer for the photos?
- Right wing blogo-smear, that's how.

135
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:20,734
I could stand here and perpetuate
the rumor that as a young man...

136
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:24,341
the president had a gambling addiction,
but I'm got going to sink to their level.

137
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,776
Despite eye witness
accounts and documentation.

138
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,448
They sling mud,
we sling ideas.

139
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,424
Still, if Greenleaf loses,
you'll be 0 for 7 on the national scene.

140
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,497
Thank you, Betty. Sorry, folks,
that's all I have time for.

141
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,098
Leeches!

142
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,128
Why it's important to vote.

143
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,967
Many brave soldiers
sacrificed themselves.

144
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,902
A right we take for granted.

145
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,499
- For the people.
- By the people.

146
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,676
We the people!

147
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,204
I can't read my writing.

148
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,079
All the world's great civilizations
have followed the same path.

149
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:04,048
From bondage, to liberty,
from liberty to abundance...

150
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:08,352
from abundance to complacency.
From complacency to apathy...

151
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,753
from apathy back to bondage.

152
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,732
If we're to be the exception to history,
then we must break the cycle.

153
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,960
For those who do not remember
the past are condemned to repeat it.

154
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,134
Very good, everybody.
Very good.

155
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:27,809
Hold this.

156
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:31,642
Okay, remember, no running
till you get out to the playground.

157
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,803
Your last one was great.
I'd like to use it on the news.

158
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,684
- Molly?
- Yes.

159
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,081
Molly, come here.

160
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,343
This is Ms. Madison.
She's the reporter from the news.

161
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,748
- Hi, Molly.
- Hi.

162
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,990
- How you doing?
- Good.

163
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,497
Your essay was very thoughtful.

164
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:47,594
Thanks.

165
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,492
Ms. Madison is going
to show your essay tonight.

166
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,494
- Isn't that exciting?
- Yes, madam.

167
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:56,007
Tell me something. What do you
want to be when you grow up?

168
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:03,478
I go back and forth. Either
a veterinarian or chairman of the Fed.

169
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:08,983
Where's Bud?

170
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:13,882
Went to take a leak half an hour ago.
I heard his name over the loudspeaker.

171
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,389
What'd you have for lunch?

172
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,856
- Egg salad. You?
- Hard boiled.

173
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,099
Hey, Bud.

174
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,498
Just giving you a heads up.

175
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,576
Management wants us
to cut another ten percent.

176
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:40,279
Well,
you are management, Carl.

177
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,918
Look, you haven't punched
in on time in six months.

178
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:49,890
So, I'm five minutes late every once
in a while. What is the big whoop?

179
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:53,659
You took thirty-one
sick days this year, Bud.

180
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:59,527
Well, I gotta kid, Carl.
She brings it home from school.

181
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,185
<i>Shit! Goddamnit!</i>

182
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,241
Well, hell, Carl!

183
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:47,017
You could have showed me
your footage when you walked in.

184
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,554
I know we went to school together, Bud.
I've always liked you.

185
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,524
You gotta give me one good
reason why I should keep you.

186
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,860
Why I can keep you.

187
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,090
All hellsabelle!

188
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,462
Sorry you lost your job.

189
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,541
That's alright, Henry. Just...

190
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:51,205
As soon as take your money,
I'm going from fired to retired.

191
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,546
- Hey, Bud!
- Yes?

192
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,419
Molly is on TV!

193
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,120
- <i>Apathy back to bondage.</i>
- Geez!

194
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:03,191
<i>If we are to be the exception to history,</i>
<i>then we must break the cycle.</i>

195
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,259
- Curly, what time you got?
- Nine past seven.

196
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:07,691
God!

197
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,130
God, man! Shit!

198
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,220
Goddamnit!

199
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,246
PLEASE,
INSERT YOUR BALLOT

200
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,917
ERROR CODE - RESTART

201
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,077
I hurt the top of my head.

202
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:24,978
Come on, lay down.

203
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,497
I'm so sorry, baby.

204
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,171
I want to live with Mom.

205
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:57,681
Me too.

206
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:16,158
<i>New Mexico</i>
<i>is a classic swing state.</i>

207
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,801
- <i>Mrs. Madison?</i>
- Speaking.

208
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,807
<i>I'm calling</i>
<i>from the New Mexico election board.</i>

209
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,632
- The what?
- <i>The New Mexico election board.</i>

210
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:27,483
<i>Madam, did you cast your vote</i>
<i>at a Texico polling station last night?</i>

211
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,811
I voted in the morning.

212
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,843
<i>In the morning. Alright.</i>

213
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:32,755
Is there something the matter?

214
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,549
<i>No, no, sorry to bother you.</i>

215
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,222
<i>It is amazing. With every state</i>
<i>but New Mexico reporting...</i>

216
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,990
<i>we're now in a dead heat</i>
<i>for the American presidency.</i>

217
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,125
<i>Each candidate with virtually</i>
<i>the same amount of electoral votes.</i>

218
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:48,127
<i>270, the magic number to win.</i>
<i>This is a real photo finish!</i>

219
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,404
<i>And it goes to whoever wins</i>
<i>the popular vote in the state.</i>

220
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,205
<i>All five electoral college votes</i>
<i>then swing to that party.</i>

221
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,496
<i>Well, they don't call it the land</i>
<i>of enchantment for nothing.</i>

222
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,108
<i>Whoever takes New Mexico,</i>
<i>takes the White House.</i>

223
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:03,416
<i>It's déjà vu again. 2000 presidential</i>
<i>election came down to Dade County.</i>

224
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:08,551
<i>400 votes in the state of Florida,</i>
<i>out of a total of 105 million cast.</i>

225
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,327
<i>If this is a certified tie, neither the</i>
<i>candidate would receive the majority.</i>

226
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:17,194
<i>Do we even have a president</i>
<i>to deal with this?</i>

227
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,464
<i>Pursuant to the 12th amendment, the</i>
<i>House of Representatives would decide.</i>

228
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,394
<i>That hasn't happened since...</i>

229
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:27,174
<i>John Quincy Adams defeated</i>
<i>Andrew Jackson back in 1824.</i>

230
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,870
<i>We're talking rare.</i>

231
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,310
<i>No, this isn't a great civics lesson</i>
<i>to the people of this country?</i>

232
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:37,511
<i>If anyone in New Mexico didn't vote,</i>
<i>he be kicking themselves right now.</i>

233
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:42,152
<i>The latest reports coming in,</i>
<i>Curry County still too close to call.</i>

234
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,219
<i>This election is down to a single</i>
<i>county. Is this even possible?</i>

235
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:51,165
Listen, John, there's only 653
registered voters in Texico.

236
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:52,863
<i>And they've already</i>
<i>recounted those votes.</i>

237
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:56,635
I know. With that information
and a dollar, I could buy a chalupa!

238
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:59,243
Everyone I know who voted
has been personally called.

239
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:01,203
So what?

240
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:04,004
So, the election. The fact
that it's down to Curry County...

241
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,283
it has something
to do with Texico.

242
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,219
Oh my God. Call you back!

243
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,169
Bud!

244
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:31,732
Come on!

245
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,746
God, my head!

246
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,311
What? What time is it?

247
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,986
There's some people
here to see you.

248
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:45,751
Some people?

249
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:47,752
They look official.

250
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,963
- Child services?
- That's what I'm thinking.

251
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,845
- Okay.
- Here we go.

252
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,448
Mr. Johnson, we would have called first,
but you don't have a telephone.

253
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:20,915
No, no, no, we got a phone.

254
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,348
It's just not connected right now.
But I'm on it, you know.

255
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:27,354
I'm not gonna say it's been easy
since the wife left, but...

256
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,727
- we're getting on fine.
- Sure are.

257
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:35,237
And I'm gonna pay these off, I swear.
Just as soon as I find a new job.

258
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,466
- A new job?
- Yes.

259
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:42,772
I used to be in this Willy Nelson
tribute band. I was thinking about...

260
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:47,582
getting the guys back together again,
soon as our bass player gets paroled.

261
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,684
And the drinking, I know it,
I know it looks bad.

262
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:54,590
And licking that sucker
is at the top of my list.

263
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,653
Please don't take away from me.

264
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,727
I'll do anything you say,
I swear.

265
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,468
She's just my only good thing.

266
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,730
Mr. Johnson,
we're not from Social Services.

267
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,065
No?

268
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,534
We're from the State
Election Bureau.

269
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:16,544
Fuck! Thank you, Jesus!

270
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,884
I'm Secretary of State Brower.
And this is Attorney General Wyatt.

271
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:25,752
Mr. Johnson,
did you cast your vote last night?

272
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,118
Last night, did you vote?

273
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:34,828
That's right,
it's my civic duty, isn't it?

274
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,192
Indeed it is.

275
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,004
Mr. Johnson,
is this your signature?

276
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:45,875
I guess.

277
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,463
You guess it's your signature?

278
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:52,041
No, no. That's right.
That's my signature.

279
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:53,879
Did you retain your stub?

280
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,083
What stub?

281
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,785
The perforated stub
on top of your ballot.

282
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:11,330
Where's that perforated stub
that I gave you for your school project?

283
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,732
I've got it.

284
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:25,877
It's him.

285
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,545
Yeah, it's him. What do you mean,
"him?" Me, him?

286
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:31,986
Sir, your vote didn't count.

287
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,248
Mr. Johnson,
it's our duty to inform you...

288
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,128
that you are entitled to recast
your ballot in a timely manner.

289
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,789
What if I don't want to?

290
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:43,893
Bud!

291
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:50,666
Alright then, how about if I, how
about if I just whisper it to you then?

292
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,143
Right here we'd get it over with,
right now and you can listen too!

293
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,543
No, sir, there are strict rules
and legal procedures.

294
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,573
Legal shit. Shit, fellas,
I can't afford a lawyer.

295
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,614
You're not in trouble.
You don't need a lawyer.

296
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,319
However,
I will have to administer an oath.

297
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,455
An oath?

298
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:08,287
An oath. Please,
place your hand on the Bible.

299
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,897
Do you, Earnest Johnson...

300
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,359
swear to recast your ballot
in the spirit of the law?

301
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,698
Yeah, yes, sure. Okay.

302
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,032
So noted.

303
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:23,700
A petition will be filed on your behalf
and a date will be set for your revote.

304
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:28,505
Does this put me
on some sort of fast track list?

305
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,145
You know, for like jury duty?

306
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:37,245
Considering the gravity of this
situation, keep all of this a secret.

307
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:39,553
Have a good night.

308
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:56,601
<i>Sorry.</i>

309
00:27:57,575 --> 00:28:01,534
You should be! I could get into
all kinds of trouble because of you!

310
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,341
Gosh, Molly!

311
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:08,410
Why can't you
learn just to let things be?

312
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:13,247
I told you this was important to me,
but you never listen!

313
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,888
<i>Another astonishing development:</i>
<i>New Mexico Elections Bureau is reporting...</i>

314
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:31,001
<i>a single irregular ballot is holding</i>
<i>up a final decision in the state.</i>

315
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:34,772
<i>As I said, a single ballot.</i>
<i>That's one vote, folks!</i>

316
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:38,234
<i>This really couldn't get any stranger,</i>
<i>MSNBC has learned that the voter...</i>

317
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,774
<i>has been identified and has</i>
<i>agreed to recast the ballot.</i>

318
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:45,279
<i>One voter will decide the fate</i>
<i>of the state's five electoral votes.</i>

319
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:50,315
<i>On this bizarre day, no one</i>
<i>will soon forget, one American citizen...</i>

320
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:54,287
<i>will effectively choose the next</i>
<i>President of the United States.</i>

321
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:58,366
Apparently the electronic
voting machine malfunctioned.

322
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,155
The ballot was scanned, but the machine
died before the vote was counted.

323
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:02,059
It's an anomaly.

324
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,473
No shit, Larry! What polling
station was the machine in?

325
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,510
Texico, New Mexico, sir.

326
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:08,438
Is that a place?

327
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,339
Where the hell is Texico?

328
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,179
New Mexico, sir, Curry County.

329
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,516
New Mexico election law dictates
if a voter's right is violated...

330
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,682
The voter shall be-entitled
to recast the ballot. I know.

331
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:24,350
Alright, kids,
we're going to war.

332
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,623
A map!
Somebody get me a map!

333
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:30,961
There's one schmuck standing between us
and the White House. Find out who it is.

334
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,702
We can't do that legally.

335
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,070
Just find him.

336
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,814
We were supposed
to my cytoplasm out of Jell-O today.

337
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,270
What kinda kid would rather
sit in a crummy classroom...

338
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,651
than be out here?

339
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:53,613
What kind of father goes fishing
when he should be looking for a new job?

340
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,518
The kind who would just like...

341
00:29:56,528 --> 00:30:00,464
to spend a little more time
with his daughter.

342
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,328
That's who.

343
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,097
- Fine.
- Fine.

344
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,498
Anyway, I've been thinking.

345
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,270
How refreshing!

346
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,442
Jesus! You gotta quit being
such a smart ass all the time?

347
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:20,484
And you've got to stop using Jesus
as a cuss word all the time!

348
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,739
He's a billion people's Savior.

349
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,847
Alright, fine, okay?
I get it.

350
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,357
- Fine.
- Fine.

351
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:37,920
I wish...
your mom could be here...

352
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,496
to talk to you about
everything that's going on.

353
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:44,739
I really do.

354
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,407
No, she... no, she can't.

355
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:52,605
She's just, she can't, baby.

356
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:57,821
Bud.

357
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,720
Next Tuesday, is bring
your father to school day.

358
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,523
- So?
- I want you to come.

359
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:15,633
It's not gonna embarrass
you that I don't have a job?

360
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,267
I don't care.

361
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,370
I want you to come anyway.

362
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,208
- Think you can remember?
- Of course.

363
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:29,678
How?

364
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,422
Well...

365
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,949
I'll write it on my forehead.

366
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,135
Can I go to school, now?

367
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:53,009
Yes. Just one more cast.

368
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,182
Why don't you go
start the truck.

369
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,974
Try to get a two shot, alright?
Okay, come on!

370
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,265
Earnest Johnson!

371
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,809
- Yes?
- Kate Madison.

372
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,706
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

373
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,852
Shit! You're the lady
from the news.

374
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,218
I am, and I'd like
to ask you a few questions.

375
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,655
You know, you're much prettier
than you are on the TV.

376
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:41,979
Thanks. I would...

377
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:45,622
Don't get me wrong,
you're pretty on the TV too.

378
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,163
Just, we got an old set
that kinda "squirshes" you.

379
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,130
Squishes everybody.

380
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,693
I believe, Mr. Johnson.
I believe...

381
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,331
You can call me Bud.

382
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:58,230
Bud. I was hoping you
could tell me why those men...

383
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,733
flew from Santa Fe,
to see you in the middle of the night.

384
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:12,313
Well, actually, I kinda promised
to keep that a secret.

385
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,916
You mean,
you're going to recast your vote.

386
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,265
Well, shit, I guess that I guess
it ain't that much of a secret then.

387
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,661
Now, listen, Bud,
you need to watch your language.

388
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,963
- We're taping this for TV, okay?
- The language?

389
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:30,607
Goddamnit, yes of course!

390
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:36,146
The question now is, who you voted for
and are you going to vote the same way?

391
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,247
Remind me again who's running?

392
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:44,177
What you're saying is,
you're keeping an open mind?

393
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,054
Yeah, that's...

394
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:48,855
That's the kinda guy I am.

395
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:50,750
You gotta be kidding me!

396
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,454
This is OJ big. Bigger!

397
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,323
I gotta call network!

398
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:01,297
John,
let me break the story.

399
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,034
I thought I was gonna die
in this shithole.

400
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,768
You said that when the time was right,
you'd give me a chance. That's the time!

401
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,003
We'll be back to a real market.

402
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:10,967
The city! With elevators and Chinese
restaurants and crime and traffic.

403
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:13,871
I got the tape
of Mrs. Zachary's prize winning sow.

404
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,819
Screw Mrs. Zachary.
And screw the sow!

405
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:16,977
You promised me.

406
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:20,313
Get network on the phone.
Don't screw it up.

407
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:24,119
- You won't regret it!
- Better not! Darlene!

408
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:39,566
So... is your dad coming
to talk to our class?

409
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:46,306
I don't know. Doesn't really leave
the house much since my mom left.

410
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,977
Mine left too.

411
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,823
She's pursuing
a singing career in Albuquerque.

412
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,857
I'm going to move there
when she becomes a big star.

413
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,725
And she's gonna take me
on tour and everything.

414
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,362
She'll probably do
a concert in Austin.

415
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,425
I could get you free tickets.

416
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,563
Maybe.
Guess I could borrow my dad's car.

417
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,369
I'll wait till he gets drunk.
Sometimes he passes out.

418
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,574
Do you think
I could try your skateboard?

419
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:24,814
Okay.

420
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:36,332
I'm the king of Curry County, John,
and I've been 15 years at this desk.

421
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,597
I feel for you, Ted.
Don't make me call security.

422
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,678
Holy crap!

423
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,947
You, desk! Sit!

424
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,587
People,
we go live in 30 seconds!

425
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,621
From this point on,
the news counts!

426
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:03,058
So excited,
I got my accent back. My god!

427
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,096
And cue graphics!

428
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:07,928
And cue music!

429
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,298
And cue!

430
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:17,106
Good evening. This is Madison, coming
to you from Curry County, New Mexico.

431
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:20,711
Over the last 24 hours,
the American political process...

432
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:24,578
<i>has ground to a virtual standstill</i>
<i>as the world watches...</i>

433
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:29,650
<i>waiting for the outcome of an election.</i>
<i>Today, I uncovered the identity...</i>

434
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,552
<i>of the person the entire</i>
<i>world has been looking for.</i>

435
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,191
<i>The one swing voter</i>
<i>who will decide the election.</i>

436
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,952
<i>Those of you hoping to hear that</i>
<i>decision will be sorely disappointed.</i>

437
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:43,395
<i>Because you are about to meet</i>
<i>a registered independent...</i>

438
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,332
<i>who claims to be</i>
<i>keeping an open mind.</i>

439
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,800
<i>Imagine,</i>
<i>on this man's shoulders...</i>

440
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,942
<i>stands the future</i>
<i>of the free world.</i>

441
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:54,744
Just the kind of guy I am.

442
00:36:56,647 --> 00:37:00,947
Let it never again be said,
that a single vote counts for nothing.

443
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:11,485
Bud!

444
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:12,819
Bud!

445
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:14,590
What?

446
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,124
There's some people outside.

447
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:21,698
Geez, you gotta stop
waking me up like this, okay?

448
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:23,434
You're gonna kill me.

449
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:25,805
There are some people outside!

450
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,006
People?

451
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,044
God!

452
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,718
No, not there! Out front!

453
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:39,014
Oh, God... What now?

454
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:43,420
- Dad, hurry up!
- Yeah, I'm going, honey.

455
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,920
There's a lot of people
out there.

456
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:51,793
Okay, honey, let's see
what the fuss is all about.

457
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,168
<i>Is that him?</i>

458
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:58,970
Bud!

459
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,534
Mr. Johnson,
any decisions yet?

460
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:17,017
- Holy shit!
- What do they want?

461
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:19,661
I don't know.

462
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:24,860
Go turn the TV on, baby.

463
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,974
<i>We are in the midst</i>
<i>of a historic moment.</i>

464
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,582
<i>The swing voter</i>
<i>has finally been identified.</i>

465
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,981
<i>We go live now to a trailer</i>
<i>in Texico, New Mexico.</i>

466
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:46,117
<i>Earnest Johnson made</i>
<i>an appearance just moments ago.</i>

467
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,984
<i>Apparently, overwhelmed</i>
<i>by the media presence.</i>

468
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,187
<i>And Mr. Landry, exactly how long</i>
<i>have you known Earnest Johnson?</i>

469
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,732
<i>Earnest Johnson?</i>
<i>Hey, Earnest!</i>

470
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:01,204
- <i>You mean Bud?</i>
- <i>We all grew up together.</i>

471
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,698
<i>How do you think he's</i>
<i>shouldering the responsibility...</i>

472
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:06,176
<i>of picking the next President</i>
<i>of the United States?</i>

473
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:11,213
<i>Well, I'm sure that...</i>

474
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:15,849
<i>Earnest is...</i>
<i>crapping his pants.</i>

475
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:21,475
<i>He's a good guy.</i>
<i>He likes to treat them good.</i>

476
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,517
<i>We used to light</i>
<i>the mesa back here on fire!</i>

477
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,765
It's all my fault, isn't it?

478
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,066
No! No, no, no, baby, no.

479
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:38,540
None of this would have happened
if I hadn't let you down.

480
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:40,970
What are we gonna do?

481
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:42,538
Well...

482
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,214
I'm gonna back these people up.

483
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,716
Holy shit!

484
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,352
There's so many!

485
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:03,358
Ok, I'm just gonna go out there,
right? I'm gonna...

486
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:09,366
I'm gonna walk out there and tell
those people it wasn't me who voted.

487
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,236
No, you can't!

488
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:12,576
Why not?

489
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:15,138
You swore to that judge,
on a Bible and everything.

490
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,442
What? That was the middle
of the night. That can't count!

491
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:22,248
You were under oath, Bud.
Voter fraud is a felony.

492
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,787
And one more felony
and they take me away from you.

493
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,913
You're right. Shit!
I am down to one!

494
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:39,836
What do we do?

495
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:48,675
We lie. We have to.

496
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:57,148
Okay, that's a good plan.
Just a little white lie is all this is.

497
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,451
- Between us.
- Just between us.

498
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:03,185
Who knows,
maybe this thing, all these...

499
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:08,354
Maybe all these people,
they just go away.

500
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:46,801
Stop! Stop!

501
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,208
What the hell is this?

502
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,114
The biggest space we could find.

503
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:37,444
How we gonna do this?
Build a campaign around one man?

504
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:39,854
- I don't know how to do this.
- You're gonna leave it to me.

505
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,788
We're gonna win him, Don!
We're gonna win this guy.

506
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,244
We got the issues on our side!

507
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,014
- There you go!
- He's gonna love me!

508
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,225
What's not to love?

509
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:56,433
We're in trouble. I need you to dig up
everything you can on Earnest Johnson.

510
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:57,963
Talk to his family, his friends.

511
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,273
I want to know what he reads,
what television show he watches.

512
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:04,804
His hobbies, his favorite foods,
his hopes, his dreams, everything.

513
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:09,683
All we have to do is win
over one American mind!

514
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:11,479
You know, I was just thinking,
Marty.

515
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,383
I'd like to get to know
this Bud Johnson. Personally.

516
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:15,625
Okay. Good.

517
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,927
Maybe take him out
for some ice cream.

518
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:22,458
Ice cream?

519
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,061
What grown man
doesn't like ice cream?

520
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:32,205
No higher education,
not much lower education.

521
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:34,670
Divorced single father,
recently laid off.

522
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:35,837
What's our first step?

523
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:39,141
Put you in a room together. See if you
persuade him to come over to our side.

524
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:45,186
I like it. Him and me in a room. Yes,
talking ideas, seeing what comes up.

525
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,211
Great plan.
I'll get you some talking points.

526
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:48,782
I'm good off the cuff already.

527
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:53,783
Of course! We're just gonna get
an itty bitty think tank together.

528
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:57,563
We'll run the data, see what you two
could possibly have in common.

529
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,802
Your petition has been processed.

530
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:04,497
And in accordance with New Mexico state
law, Chapter 1, Article 13, Section 11.

531
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:08,797
Could you do us a favor and back
these news people up a little bit?

532
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,804
We could barely
sleep last night.

533
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,912
said voter Earnest Johnson,
is hereby authorized...

534
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:20,913
to recast his vote 10 days
from today along official.

535
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:24,520
And there's a fat guy there,
he keeps leaning on my truck...

536
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:26,587
fixing his hair
in my side mirror.

537
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:35,756
Said voter, Earnest Johnson,
is hereby authorized to recast his vote...

538
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:39,231
10 days from today. Along official
documentary notification...

539
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,336
to both state,
federal regulatory authorities.

540
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,541
Bud, life's gonna be
a little different from now on.

541
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:46,847
You'll need security
around the clock.

542
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:48,076
For what?

543
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,316
You're a household name.

544
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:53,680
Every political nut job in the country
is gonna make their way down here.

545
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:58,284
In 10 days, you gonna make the most
important decision in the free world.

546
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,251
And it is our job to make sure
this thing comes off fair and square.

547
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:04,234
So, if there's anything
that you think we need to know...

548
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:09,334
Like what?

549
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,105
Something
we may find out later.

550
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,870
Better now, than later.

551
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:22,042
No, sir,
there's nothing to know.

552
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,750
Molly! Molly! Molly!

553
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:32,026
- I don't believe it. She's his daughter!
- Who's his daughter?

554
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,724
The Chairman of the Fed,
the girl that won the essay contest.

555
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,859
Remember, I ran the story on her,
election day?

556
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:40,269
This is perfect! The network wants
to do an interview with her daddy.

557
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,426
I'm not going
to use this little girl!

558
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,964
I've told you this before.
I have integrity, like Paula Zahn.

559
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,794
I met Paula Zahn.

560
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,506
Paula Zahn eats
where my friend is a waiter, alright?

561
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,140
I don't want to hurt
your feelings, you're no Paula Zahn.

562
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,274
No Paula Zahn?

563
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,874
I booked this story.
It was me.

564
00:45:55,886 --> 00:46:00,016
Yes, that's why everybody here
is trying to rip it out from under you.

565
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:03,782
You want a desk in New York,
you want a desk in Los Angeles?

566
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:06,328
Forget everything you learned
in journalism school.

567
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:11,400
This isn't new anymore. This isn't life.
This is bigger. This is television!

568
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:45,888
<i>The Johnsons have been virtually</i>
<i>besieged inside their trailer.</i>

569
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:48,804
<i>but we're lucky to be joined</i>
<i>by their pizza delivery man.</i>

570
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,839
<i>How would you characterize</i>
<i>Earnest Johnson's state of mind?</i>

571
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:55,007
<i>Mostly I'd say, he was hungry.</i>

572
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:56,238
<i>He was hungry.</i>

573
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:58,374
<i>Well, there you have it.</i>

574
00:46:58,382 --> 00:46:59,747
I ain't tipping him anymore.

575
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,679
I ought to trim
Mrs. Hardy's elm.

576
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:07,346
Looks like it's moving in our roof.
What do you think?

577
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:10,785
Hard to tell.
What do you think?

578
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:13,024
Definitely.

579
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:17,393
<i>Since has become the most Googled</i>
<i>town in the world...</i>

580
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:20,228
<i>narrowly edging out in Jihad.</i>

581
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:52,329
Holy crap!

582
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,031
- You Bud?
- Yeah!

583
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,071
You're Richard Petty.

584
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,169
You got it, man.

585
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,906
Hold on. Honey!
It's the king!

586
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,873
I got a friend down the road I want
you to meet. You wanna go for a ride?

587
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:10,813
Yes!
could my daughter come?

588
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:14,321
In that case, maybe you'd better
drive. Precious cargo and all!

589
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,593
Just a minute, Mr. Petty.
Hey, Chubby!

590
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,897
Just because it ain't rolling, don't
make it furniture! Back out of here!

591
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,536
Come on, baby! We gotta go!

592
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:31,869
You're Richard Petty!

593
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,577
Molly! Get a picture, honey.

594
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:47,887
If you told me two days ago
that I'd be driving your Dodge...

595
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:49,386
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

596
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:53,061
Get one more. Get it with my chin
out a little bit. Like that.

597
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:54,929
Like a hero.

598
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,664
I told you, you crazy!

599
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:59,663
You ain't seen nothing yet.

600
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:28,556
Bud!

601
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,394
This is the President's plane.

602
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:38,067
Hello, you be Molly. I'm Mr. Fox,
I work with the President.

603
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,409
Hi.
Hi. Bud, Martin Fox.

604
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:43,270
- Hello.
- How are you? Come in.

605
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:45,076
Take your hat off please.
Your hat.

606
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,815
So, this is the Johnson family.

607
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:50,046
Welcome to Air Force One.
Hi, Molly.

608
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:51,777
- Thanks for having us, sir.
- It's a pleasure.

609
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,684
- Mr. President.
- Huh?

610
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,549
Call him Mr. President.

611
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:59,391
It's an honor, Mr. President.

612
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:01,622
It's an honor to meet you, Bud.
May I call you Bud?

613
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,791
Yes, Mr. President.

614
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:05,132
Come on in, come on.

615
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:08,199
God, this...

616
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:12,204
This place
is it's really something!

617
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:15,772
It's my little home in the sky.

618
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,246
It's kinda,
like a trailer with wings.

619
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:22,345
Fine analogy, Bud.

620
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:25,788
Molly, I saw your speech
on TV the other night.

621
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:26,978
Very impressive!

622
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,685
- Say thank you, baby.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

623
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,526
- You must be a very proud father.
- Yes, sir.

624
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:39,201
God, I'm sorry.
Mr. President.

625
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:44,093
You can see why she's definitely
the brains of our operation.

626
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:46,541
I know what you mean.
we all need a Molly.

627
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:48,808
Marty here, is my Molly.

628
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:53,436
That's right. Molly,
I bet a smart kid like you...

629
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,145
would love to see the war room.

630
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,144
No, thanks.

631
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:00,851
Why don't we have a peek and then your
dad and the President can have a talk.

632
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:03,893
Go on, Honey.
Daddy has to talk to the President.

633
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:08,662
She's a firecracker!

634
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,633
Yes, sir, she's the whole deal!

635
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,538
I wouldn't mind seeing
the war room, Mr. President.

636
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,970
I'll show it to you later.
And please, call me Andy.

637
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:22,276
- Andy?
- Yeah.

638
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:27,309
Are you sure,
that-that other guy...

639
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:29,877
I know, things can get
a little formal around here.

640
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:32,621
Commander in Chief, running
the country and all that. Please.

641
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,717
I am just an ordinary man,
like you...

642
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,856
The kinda guy you can sit down
and have a beer with.

643
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,260
Would you like a beer, Bud?

644
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:44,658
A beer?

645
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:48,765
No shit?

646
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:50,235
No shit.

647
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:53,031
Well, then...

648
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:57,107
- Yes. Hell, yeah, Andy.
- Okay!

649
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:59,448
David, would you get us
a couple of beers, please?

650
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,743
- Thank you very much.
- So...

651
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,152
you're gonna have some
story to tell your friends.

652
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:12,056
I read about you in the paper.
They say you've never lost an election.

653
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:16,123
That's right. You can learn
a lot from reading the newspaper.

654
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:20,994
They also said that you don't
believe in anything anymore.

655
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,703
Even if it meant
selling your mother's soul.

656
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:27,368
No, see, no, see that's libelous,
Because my mother is a wonderful...

657
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:30,672
wonderful, wonderful woman.

658
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:46,024
If you met my mother,
you'd understand.

659
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:49,325
You a football fan, Bud?

660
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:54,061
Well, I'm an American, aren't I?

661
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:57,964
I played a little in high school.

662
00:52:58,475 --> 00:52:59,806
Did you now? What position?

663
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:00,932
I was quarterback.

664
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:06,077
I always thought football was
a strategic game. A lot like diplomacy.

665
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:09,801
You got your offense, your defense,
the President is like your quarterback...

666
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,286
and the American voters...

667
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:14,989
Well... they're like the coach.

668
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,326
Never thought of it that way.

669
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,987
Now the coach's job
is to make sure...

670
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:24,057
that the right man has
the football at the critical time.

671
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,569
I know exactly what you mean,
Andy.

672
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:28,198
Do you?

673
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:31,939
Maybe not.

674
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:36,905
Bring in the football, please.

675
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:40,749
Bud.

676
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:44,544
You wanna hold the football?

677
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:47,382
There's a football in there?

678
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:54,721
That case holds
the launch codes...

679
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,096
to America's nuclear arsenal.

680
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,001
That's what
this election's all about.

681
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:06,299
launch codes like...
missiles and shit?

682
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:09,812
I want you to pretend
that America is a team...

683
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,079
- and you're the coach.
- Okay.

684
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:16,835
Let's say it's the 4th quarter. We've
got possession, but we're down by five.

685
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:19,276
North Korea has us pinned
in our own fifteenth line...

686
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:24,226
with one second on the dooms day clock.
What are you doing to do?

687
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:29,457
Okay, you go long. The only thing
standing between victory and defeat...

688
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:32,161
is a successful Hail Mary.
One play.

689
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,494
Who are you
gonna give the ball to, Bud?

690
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:37,893
Do you pin your hopes on some
liberal second string quarterback...

691
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:41,138
who hasn't had five minutes
in the big show? Of course you don't.

692
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:44,544
You do the smart thing.

693
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:48,776
The only thing. You go
with your strongest arm, the man...

694
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,719
who's carried you through the season,
who's never let you down.

695
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:59,361
Bud, America's counting on you.

696
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:03,558
Yes, sir.
I'm not gonna let them down.

697
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:04,964
But, here.

698
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:10,339
Wouldn't want to drop
the old football.

699
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:12,572
Blow up France or something.

700
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:14,693
You couldn't.

701
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:19,341
There's a whole bunch of secret
codes and these special little keys.

702
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:20,542
Here's to you!

703
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:26,250
Look at all... Look at all
this stuff they give us, Molly.

704
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:30,326
They give us the same shampoo
that the President uses.

705
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:31,694
Great.

706
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,461
So, what did you guys talk about?

707
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:45,033
- Stuff.
- What stuff?

708
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:46,332
You know...

709
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:49,203
grown up stuff.

710
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:50,535
Like?

711
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:52,875
Like...

712
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:58,079
Bud!

713
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,083
What stuff?

714
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:04,285
Like grown up stuff.
You know, coaching. Football.

715
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,624
Geothermal nuclear war.

716
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,599
Andy's, a great... great guy.

717
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:15,195
He's not Andy.
He's the President of the United States.

718
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:16,498
And he just wants your vote.

719
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:19,798
And gee, guess what?
He's gonna get it.

720
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:21,536
It's not even yours to give!

721
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:23,838
You're gonna...

722
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,149
ruin everything.

723
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:32,184
Andy, the President,
invited me to watch the game...

724
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:33,982
- with him on Monday night.
- That's a bribe!

725
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:36,015
That's not a bribe.

726
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,218
- Is too.
- It is not.

727
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:38,521
- Is too.
- It is not.

728
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:40,961
- Is too!
- Is not! What it is, "too"?

729
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:44,357
- What the hell do you know?
- More than you.

730
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:45,459
- You do not.
- Do too.

731
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:47,231
- You do not.
- Do too.

732
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,733
- Fine.
- Fine.

733
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:01,214
Did you smell
all the leather on that plane?

734
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:10,018
<i>If I made you feel second best</i>

735
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,226
<i>I'm sorry I was blind</i>

736
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:17,031
No, baby, leave it, leave it.
That's Willie.

737
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:21,827
<i>You were always on my mind</i>

738
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,734
<i>Hi, I'm Willie Nelson.</i>

739
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:29,871
<i>And when I'm not performing,</i>
<i>I'm usually getting involved.</i>

740
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,374
<i>Hey, Bud, if you're out there</i>
<i>and you're watching...</i>

741
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,216
He's talking to us!

742
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:39,142
<i>There's a special dinner,</i>
<i>especially for you in your honor...</i>

743
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:44,821
<i>hosted by my good friend and</i>
<i>Presidential candidate Donald Greenleaf.</i>

744
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,461
- <i>I'll see you here tonight.</i>
- I'll do it, Willie!

745
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,332
This is really getting weird.

746
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:21,887
Democrat or a Republican?

747
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:25,334
I'm Art Crumb,
Donald Greenleaf's campaign manager.

748
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,399
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

749
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:32,707
You must be Molly. Quite an essay.
You have a future in politics one day.

750
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:34,873
You might too. One day.

751
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:38,609
Shall we go in?

752
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,486
Not too hard to be nice,
come on.

753
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,084
Party. Party!

754
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,754
Right this way...
make yourselves at home.
