1
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:15,326
<i>This is a frightened city.</i>

2
00:00:15,407 --> 00:00:19,241
<i>Over these houses, over these streets</i>
<i>hangs a pall of fear.</i>

3
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:22,122
<i>Fear of a new kind of violence</i>

4
00:00:22,207 --> 00:00:23,925
<i>which is terrorising the city.</i>

5
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:34,523
<i>Yes, gangs of old ladies attacking</i>
<i>defenceless, fit young men.</i>

6
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:42,840
<i>What are they in it for, these old hoodlums,</i>
<i>these layabouts in lace?</i>

7
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:45,919
Well, it's something to do isn't it?

8
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:48,116
It's good fun.

9
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:51,279
Nowadays, some of us daren't even
go down to the shops.

10
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:55,162
Well, Mr Johnson's son Kevin,
he don't go out any more.

11
00:00:55,447 --> 00:00:58,439
He comes back from wrestling
and locks himself in his room.

12
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:02,162
<i>Favourite targets for the old ladies</i>
<i>are telephone kiosks.</i>

13
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:06,805
Well, come on, come on, off with you.

14
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:10,084
Clear out. Come on, off. Get out of it.

15
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:13,558
We have a lot of trouble with these oldies.

16
00:01:13,647 --> 00:01:16,081
Pension day's the worst, they go mad.

17
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:18,078
As soon as they get their hands
on their money,

18
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:22,285
they blow it all on milk, bread, tea,
tin of meat for the cat.

19
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:25,518
The whole problem
of these senile delinquents

20
00:01:25,807 --> 00:01:30,517
lies in their complete rejection of the values
of contemporary society.

21
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:34,122
They've seen their children grow up
and become accountants,

22
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:36,562
stockbrokers and even sociologists,

23
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:40,401
and they begin to wonder, is it all really...

24
00:01:55,207 --> 00:01:57,562
<i>But this is not just an old ladies' town.</i>

25
00:01:57,647 --> 00:02:01,799
<i>There are other equally dangerous gangs,</i>
<i>such as the baby snatchers.</i>

26
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:09,640
I just left my husband outside here
while I went in to do some shopping,

27
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:12,082
and I came back and he was gone.

28
00:02:12,527 --> 00:02:14,358
He was only 47.

29
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:20,599
<i>And on the roads, too,</i>
<i>vicious gangs of "keep left" signs.</i>

30
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:27,676
Right, right, stop it. This film's got silly.

31
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:31,316
Started off as a nice little idea
about grannies attacking young men,

32
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:32,886
but now it's got silly.

33
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:35,242
That man's hair is too long for a vicar, too.

34
00:02:35,327 --> 00:02:37,443
Those signs are pretty badly made.

35
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:40,166
Right, now for a complete change of mood.

36
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:45,125
Ron, now, let's just get this quite clear,

37
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,677
you're intending to jump
across the English Channel?

38
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:50,758
Oh, yes, that is correct, yes.

39
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:52,724
And just how far is that?

40
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,726
Oh, well, it's 26 miles from here to Calais.

41
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:57,520
That's to the beach at Calais?

42
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:59,882
Well, no, no, provided I get a good lift off

43
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:03,243
and maybe a gust of breeze
over the French coast,

44
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:06,046
I shall be jumping into the centre
of Calais itself.

45
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:12,243
Ron, are you using any special techniques
to jump this great distance?

46
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:15,876
Oh, no, no. I shall be using
an ordinary two-footed jump

47
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:17,798
straight up in the air
and across the Channel.

48
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:21,277
I see. Ron, what is the furthest distance

49
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,483
that you've jumped so far?

50
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:28,238
11 foot 6 inches at Motspur Park
on July 22nd.

51
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:31,002
But I have done nearly 12 feet unofficially.

52
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:35,603
I see. Ron, Ron, Ron,
aren't you worried, Ron,

53
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:40,317
aren't you worried
jumping 26 miles across the sea?

54
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:46,238
Oh, well, no, no, no, no. It is, in fact,
easier to jump over sea than over dry land.

55
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:47,442
Well, how is that?

56
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,802
Well, my manager explained it to me.

57
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:53,436
You see, if you're five miles out
over the English Channel

58
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:55,438
with nothing but sea underneath you,

59
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,280
there is a very great impetus
to stay in the air.

60
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:02,645
I see. Well, thank you very much, Ron,
and the very best of luck.

61
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:04,160
Thank you, thank you.

62
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:07,637
The man behind Ron's cross-channel jump

63
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:10,400
is his manager Mr Luigi Vercotti.

64
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:11,806
Mr Vercotti.

65
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:14,280
Mr Vercotti.

66
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:15,966
-Mr Vercotti.
-What?

67
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:18,319
-Mr Vercotti.
-Look, I've never been down

68
00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:20,125
the old Coco Club.
I don't know what you're talking about.

69
00:04:20,207 --> 00:04:22,277
No, we're from the BBC, Mr Vercotti.

70
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:23,880
-Who?
-The BBC.

71
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:28,160
Oh, I see. I thought...
I thought you were the...

72
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:30,522
I like the police a lot,

73
00:04:30,607 --> 00:04:31,960
-I've got a lot of time for them.
-Yes. Well, Mr...

74
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:35,676
Mr Vercotti, what is your chief task
as Ron's manager?

75
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:39,922
Well, my main task is to fix
a sponsor for the big jump.

76
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:43,320
-And who is the sponsor?
-The Chippenham Brick Company.

77
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:45,244
They pay all the bills,

78
00:04:45,607 --> 00:04:49,202
in return for which, Ron will be carrying
half a hundredweight of their bricks.

79
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:51,437
Clay bricks, mainly.

80
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:55,476
I see. Well, it looks as if Ron is ready now.

81
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:58,400
He's got the bricks.
He's had his passport checked,

82
00:04:58,487 --> 00:05:00,284
and he's all set to go.

83
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:11,160
And he's off on the first ever
cross-channel jump.

84
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:18,803
Will Ron be trying
the cross-channel jump again soon?

85
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:20,957
No. No, I'm taking him off the jumps,

86
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:23,322
because I've got something lined up
for Ron next week

87
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,045
that I think is very much more up his street.

88
00:05:25,127 --> 00:05:26,196
What's that?

89
00:05:26,287 --> 00:05:29,040
Ron is going to eat Chichester Cathedral.

90
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:37,276
Well, there he goes, Ron Obvious
of Neaps End, in an attempt

91
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:42,566
which could make him the first man ever
to eat an entire Anglican cathedral.

92
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:10,726
Right, David, this is something which both
Ron and myself are really keen on.

93
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:15,562
Ron is gonna tunnel from
Godalming there to Java here.

94
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:19,602
Java?

95
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:23,919
Yeah, I personally think this is gonna make
Ron a household name overnight.

96
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:25,326
And how far has he got?

97
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:29,320
Well, he's quite far now, Dave,
well on the way. Well on the way, yeah.

98
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:31,523
Well, where is he exactly?

99
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:33,526
-Yeah.
-Where?

100
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:36,485
Oh, well, you know,
it's difficult to say exactly.

101
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:39,764
He's, you know, in the area of...

102
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,246
Ron, how far have you got?

103
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:46,557
About 2 foot 6, Mr Vercotti.

104
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:48,365
Yes, well, keep digging, lad. Keep digging.

105
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:51,325
Mr Vercotti, are you sure
there isn't a spade?

106
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:09,999
I, Erik...

107
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:15,796
And now...

108
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:30,801
<i>This little-known Icelandic saga,</i>

109
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:34,641
<i>written by an unknown hand</i>
<i>in the late 13th century,</i>

110
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,765

-No, I meant terribly violent.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.
