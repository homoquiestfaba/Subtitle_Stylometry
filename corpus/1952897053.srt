1
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,458
Who is he?

2
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,364
I don't know.

3
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,674
SIX MONTHS BEFORE

4
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,018
ONE DAYWE'LL DECIPHER
THIS ENIGMA. DADDY.

5
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,562
Open your Genetics book.

6
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,296
Marcelo!

7
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,195
- Mr. Marcelo da Rocha!
- Wake up, weirdo.

8
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,366
I'm talking to you.

9
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,542
Can I ask now, Marcelo?

10
00:02:55,542 --> 00:03:00,346
What is the probability of an
albino boy being born in F-3?

11
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,177
Want me to call your mommy
to help you, Weirdo?

12
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,950
- Is there enough time for a coffee?
- Good one.

13
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,583
Twenty five percent.

14
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,761
- Who would say, huh, Tieko?
- Correct?

15
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,056
Yeah! Correct!

16
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,988
Continuing...

17
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,025
Is there enough time
for a coffee?

18
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,631
Who is the clown?

19
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,735
- It wasn't me!
- Really?

20
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,834
Question...

21
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,915
- What's the probability of...
- Of any hair growing on your bald head?

22
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,383
Fausto, straight
to the principal's office!

23
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,484
Me?

24
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,353
- Professor, it wasn't him.
- But, it wasn't me.

25
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,955
It's all my fault!

26
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:45,914
Me!? It wasn't me,
I swear it wasn't me!

27
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:48,993
What the fuck?

28
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,573
What's going on? Lmitating the
teacher, imitating your friends.

29
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,438
You're almost an adult!

30
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,912
If you applied yourself, you would have
been already accepted into college.

31
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,444
Let me see...

32
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,376
- Yourfather travels a lot?
- No.

33
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,015
No, really?

34
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,355
Mexico, China,
France, Netherlands...

35
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,457
- His father is a pilot...
- Whose father is a pilot?

36
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,482
- Weirdo's father.
- Who is Weirdo, my God?

37
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,125
- Marcelo.
- And you're Marcelo...

38
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,898
No, no, not now,
I can't see you now.

39
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,067
I'm his mother, they called me.

40
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,069
- Oh, come in please...
- What did you do this time?

41
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:34,199
Look madam, if your son doesn't
change he will be a looser.

42
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,253
You do it!

43
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,488
My son!

44
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,563
I'm with you!

45
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,256
I'm here with Renato Jaques...

46
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,657
who has become a great success...

47
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,093
and has justfinished shooting
a very popular soap opera...

48
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,195
"Wild at Heart".

49
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,697
In a way. Renato...

50
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,929
this soap has opened
the marketfor you, right?

51
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,869
What are your plans now...

52
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:40,066
What are you plans
foryour career?

53
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,768
Amaury, first of all, thank you...

54
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,877
Anyway, it's a struggle, you know?

55
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,646
This world is a struggle.

56
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,749
Thanks to God this character
worked out...

57
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,775
like we say,
it had a history...

58
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,887
New York?

59
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,759
Kennedy and La Guardia.

60
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,922
- Rio de Janeiro?
- Galeão and Santos Dumont.

61
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,997
- London?
- Heathrow. Did I say it right?

62
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,759
- Tokyo?
- Kansai?

63
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:14,195
Kohai, Kansai is in Osaka.

64
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,904
Kohai, do you remember
what I always tell you.

65
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:22,543
If you do not knoweverything,
you will be your worst enemy.

66
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:28,116
And ifit happens, Kohai,
you are as good as nothing.

67
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,921
Do you understand that, Kohai?

68
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:37,430
- Do you want to be like me?
- I want to be like you, dad.

69
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,988
Marcelo!

70
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,666
Jeez, dad! It's mom!

71
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,134
Stop banging that ball
around! I'm watching TV!

72
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:57,143
Flight 3196, going to São Paulo...

73
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,720
THE KNIGHTLYART
OF THE ZEN ARCHER

74
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,279
- Dad!
- I said I'd come.

75
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,319
- Many connections there?
- Just a few.

76
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,290
What's up Weirdo.
How's everything?

77
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,495
Give me two whiskeys
on the rocks, please.

78
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,826
Changi?

79
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,229
- Singapore!
- You got that one, huh?!

80
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:55,208
Do you really think you've got
to leave home to become a pilot?

81
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,142
- Yeah.
- What about your mom?

82
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,177
Mom is never going to let me
get offthe ground, dad.

83
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:06,809
- I can help you.
- I don't need money.

84
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,791
I want to be like you are,

85
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,318
I want to do things
my way, all normal like.

86
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,895
- Asign you're growing up.
- I need advice.

87
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,338
Do you rememberthat bedtime
story I used to tell you?

88
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,362
Which one?

89
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:30,243
About the boy from Okinawa.
Who walked day after day...

90
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,245
to get to the monastery
in Tohoku.

91
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,908
Where Toshiro Tamaoki
taught the art of archery.

92
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:39,652
The boy arrived at the exact same
instant in which great Tamoaki,

93
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:42,822
with his eyes blindfolded,
was about to shoot an arrow.

94
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,458
Suddenly, the master
lets loose the arrow.

95
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,758
Zoooooom-pow! And he hit
the target in the bull's eye.

96
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,064
The boy shouted...

97
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,965
"Master! You hit the bull's eye!"

98
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:59,231
And the master said:
"The bull's eye hit the arrow."

99
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,837
The boy said,
"I don't understand, master!"

100
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,639
"You don't understand because
you haven't learned the art yet."

101
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,439
Teach me the art, master,
the boy asked.

102
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,185
And the master gave him
a serious look and asked him:

103
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,721
"Have you already had breakfast?"

104
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,484
And he: "Yes."

105
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,818
"So go wash the dishes kid."

106
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,129
And nowyou know
whatyou have to do.

107
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,965
I have to... shit, I have
to do as you've done...

108
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,801
Iook for a small airfield,
far away from here

109
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:32,293
- and start from scratch, that's right?
- Yes, start from scratch, Kohai.

110
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,866
Yes, it's no use looking
forthe airfield...

111
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,767
the airfield will find you.

112
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,023
My, it looks so natural,
wonderful, wonderful!

113
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,559
- And howis Marcelo?
- Great! So sweet!

114
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,227
Kids are great. They're great even
afterthey growup, huh?

115
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,354
- Yeah.
- Everything is so wonderful.

116
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,963
But, all he wants
to do now is to study.

117
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,827
And he's a genius,
you know, Marcelo...

118
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,204
it's not just because he's my son,
not at all, but he is...

119
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:08,207
Yesterday the school principal
even called me over...

120
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,375
to tell me that.

121
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,535
- That he's...
- That's so nice!

122
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,912
Yeah, my son won't bejust
going to be another nobody in life,

123
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,504
I won't let him be.

124
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,482
Marcelo will be
my pride and joy,

125
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,677
he will be famous and
make me so happy...

126
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,179
Very good.

127
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:37,803
Hello?

128
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,072
Hello, please, I'd like
to send your marketing director...

129
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,597

Oh, he'sjust called.

00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,466
- Well, where do you want to go?
- Cuiabá.

147
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,608
WELCOME TO MATO GROSSO DO SUL

148
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,374
IT'S NOTTHE BULL WHO KILLS
THE BULLFIGHTER.

149
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,672
IT'S THE BULLFIGHTER WHO
LETS THE BULL KILL HIM.

150
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,303
Mister, please could
you drop me offhere?

151
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,872
I'm going to get out here, OK?

152
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,742
Thanks a lot, OK?!

153
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,653
You finish back there, Dumont?

154
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,094
Hold on!

155
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,664
Done! Can I...
can I fly a bit?

156
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,996
Just for a while, Dumont.
Keep her headed northeast.

157
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,577
Am I in charge?

158
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,146
Yeah, you're flying.

159
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,760
Papa Tango Kilo Zulu India requests
landing instructions, do you read?

160
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:06,071
Papa Tango Kilo Zulu India,
northeastern wind, 12 knots.

161
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,302
- Landing authorized Chicão.
- Zulu India.

162
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,148
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to land, Chicão!

163
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,378
No way, man. You're trying
to get me killed, shit?

164
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,254
- I knowhowto land this crate, man.
- You knowhowto land, really?

165
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,223
Landing is for pilots,
not for some goofball.

166
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,358
Lfthe wind changes down
below, we're screwed.

167
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,054
- Like a crosswind?
- Yeah, like a crosswind.

168
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:30,930
And what do you
have to do then?

169
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,331
Hold thejoystick one way
and the pedal the other.

170
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,821
It ain't easy.

171
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,198
- Keep the nose in the wind...
- And keep the nose in the wind.

172
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,504
Crabbing...

173
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,904
- Crabbing.
- Crabbing!

174
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,289
Zulu, India...

175
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,154
You have to return. Do you read me?

176
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,795
Zulu India, negative
tower, no fuel...

177
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,854
I'm going to land
here anyway...

178
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:19,005
Dumont, shit, what you
doing in there, Dumont?

179
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,180
No, come here, just
tell me one thing.

180
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,614
What do I pay you for?

181
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:26,418
For you to play pilot or to
wash my goddamn planes?

182
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,187
- I've washed them all already Pacheco.
- Washed what?

183
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:31,090
Look at this windshield, shit!

184
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,425
Pacheco, I want to talk
to you about my license.

185
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,361
You have got to be
kidding me, huh boy?!

186
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,728
Why? I've already flown over
20 hours with Chicão man.

187
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,729
You promised me Pacheco.

188
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,269
I didn't promise you
jackshit boy!

189
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,669
You crazy? You crazy?

190
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,676
I don't knowwhere
you get these ideas from!

191
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,304
I'll fly foryou for free until
I get my license Pacheco.

192
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,783
Listen here, Dumont,
let me tell you something.

193
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,452
You're here to help me,

194
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,187
not to create more
problems, no way.

195
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,990
So please, go and
finish your work...

196
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,652
and give me a break. Ok?

197
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,328
GARAGE

198
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,984
I don't want to keep
on washing you man,

199
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,744
I'll wash you today...

200
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:42,022
but I want to fly you.

201
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,226
I don't want to wash you.

202
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,098
I want to fly you!

203
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,324
- Hello?

204
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,690
It's Baña, I need a plane right now.

205
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,254
Pacheco's not here.

206
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,990
Son of a bitch!
Call him for me, shit!

207
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,763

WE CAN DISCUSS
MY PART LATER. DUMONT.

00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,900
Kilo, Zulu, India, requesting
authorization to take off.

222
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,636
Authorization granted, Zulu, India.

223
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,599
Let's go.

224
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,626
Listen...

225
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,566

00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,501
Let's go?!

227
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,687
Tora, tora, tora!

228
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,153
Are we in Paraguay already?

229
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,120
Hello?

230
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,626
What are you loading, huh? Whiskey?

231
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:56,498
Legião... You guys play
"Legião" in Paraguay?

232
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,168
Yeah...

233
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,905
What you call them
over there? "Legión"?

234
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,045
"Lexião"...

235
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,782
Lexião...

236
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:13,992
Close the door, to your room

237
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:19,294
Because if the phone rings
It just might be somebody

238
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:26,662
You'll want to talk to, for hours

239
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,344
Hello!

240
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,547
Baña, you listen to me,
if some kid comes around...

241
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:38,550
saying he's my pilot,
you shoot his ass...

242
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,085
he fucking robbed my plane!

243
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,521
No, no, no, I'm here with
the pilot you sent me.

244
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,390
What? He's there with you?
He's no fucking pilot, shit!

245
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,426
How come he's not a pilot
ifthe plane is flying Pacheco?

246
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,427
What is he talking about?

247
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,962
Make him come back.
Then you kill him, shit!

248
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,897
Yeah right, first you send me the guy
and nowyou want me to kill him.

249
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,502
Hello!? What's going on?
You drunk or something, man?

250
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:00,105
Listen Baña, you're
the drunk one!

251
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,807
Flying with that son of a bitch!

252
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,308
And if he fucked me...

253
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:06,368
he's going to fuck you
and your load too, fucking-A!

254
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,272
What? What did he say?

255
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,145
What's that?

256
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,978
Tell me, who do you work for?

257
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,223
I work for Pacheco.

258
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,925
Why is he saying
you stole his plane?

259
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,259
I don't know...
I'm going to take you...

260
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,561
and then take the plane back.

261
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:23,595
What did he say to you?

262
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,495
Aren't you afraid
of death clown?

263
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,865
If you shoot me, the
plane crashes man!

264
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,594
I knowhowto fly too, sucker!

265
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:32,200
If you knewhowto fly,
you'd already have shot me!

266
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,776
Howlong you been flying?

267
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,108
- Alone?
- I'm serious, kid!

268
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,542
Howlong we've been
in the air?

269
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,175
Around forty,
forty-five minutes, why?

270
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,515
Plus the fifteen it took
me to get you...

271
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:55,788
Shit, that'd be
my first hour flying solo.

272
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,204
Is that where
we're going to land?

273
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:08,867
Yeah.

274
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,310
What the fuck you doing?

275
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,283
- It's a crosswind!
- Oh my God!

276
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,624
Joystick to one side,
pedals the other.

277
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,491
Hold on man, we're
going to go crabbing now.

278
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,962
Holy shit.

279
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,001
Shit!

280
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:57,986
Who is this guy?

281
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:18,038
Nowthat you've completed
yourfirst hour of flying...

282
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:19,978
let'sjust see howmuch
longeryou've got to live.

283
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:20,967
What are you doing, man?!

284
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,575
What are you doing?

285
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,346
Lucky boy, huh.

286
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,452
But, let me tell you something...

287
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:34,924
if you go back with this plane,
Pacheco's gun will be sure to go off.

288
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:38,792
Let's do this, you stay here...

289
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,193
fly for free for me
until you become a real pilot.

290
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,867
I'll send the plane back,
howabout that? Is it a deal?

291
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,868
We have a deal or not?

292
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,642
You'll help me get my license?

293
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,954
And howmany songs by "Legião Urbana"
you knowhowto sing? Huh?

294
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,856
Fucking take-off of Renato Russo!

295
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,949
You almost got me killed
you son of a bitch!

296
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,710
Welcome to Paraguay, kid.

297
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,745
Tell me, what's your name?

298
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,393
Carrera.

299
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,330
Let's go, Tatu!

300
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,108
Goal!

301
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,840
3 to 1
Come on!

302
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,214
- Fuck!
- You fool, take off the ball.

303
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,455
Listen, I've got a
kamikaze flight here...

304
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,480
with a bonus and an
additional 10%, who'll go?

305
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,927
Nobody? Jair?

306
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,996
I've got a kid to raise,
shit, give me the ball.

307
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,432
Open a bed and breakfast in Bahia
then if you don't want to work.

308
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,990
- Tatu?
- I'll go!

309
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,168
No, no, no.

310
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,170
Why not? What's the problem?

311
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,705
It's a kamikaze flight and you don't
have enough experience...

312
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,306
- I can do it man.
- I can do that!

313
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,842
- Come on!
- You were with me in the crosswind!

314
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,043
The cargo is worth a lot...

315
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,876
if you go down with it I'm the one
who's screwed, I can't...

316
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:37,011
Give me a chance, man.

317
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,654
Go ahead then,
it's all yours boy...

318
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,055
It had to be him anyway...

319
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,223
you'rejust all a bunch oflowlifes.

320
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,925
- Give me the fucking ball!
- Try retiring man!

321
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,586
Give me the ball!

322
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,895
Back to the game, guys.

323
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,692
That's it, at the center.

324
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,129
What's a kamikaze flight?

325
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,359
When the load is worth a lot, you have
to fly it kamikaze, you get me?

326
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,874
You take offwith just enough fuel...

327
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,967
to fly to the delivery point.

328
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:09,307
It's the boss's guarantee
you won't steal his load.

329
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,616
The airstrip is kept in the dark...

330
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,811
until the time you're
supposed to be arriving.

331
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:18,952
Kiddo, if you are not
a fucking good pilot...

332
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,488
you're screwed!

333
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,225
It's him, now!

334
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,500
Dad? Can you talk?

335
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,633
I think now I've become
a real pilot!

336
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:55,946
Yeah, my boss is
a great guy. It's just that.

337
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:03,322
Criminal no way. I'm a pilot...

338
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,523
I'm a pilot, like you!

339
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:09,692
What...

340
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,404
I didjust what you told me to do!

341
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:14,803
I...

342
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,400
Hello? Dad?

343
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,883
Hasta la vista, baby!
Ra-ta-ta-ta!

344
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,701
Come in, Carrera.
Come here.

345
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,879
Sit down.

346
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,922
Boss, I can't work
for you anymore.

347
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,229
What happened?

348
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,573
Happened...

349
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,678
I don't want you to get
mad at me...

350
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:34,246
but when the guys
opened those crates and...

351
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,055
they were full of guns inside.

352
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,556
I'm no good for things like that.

353
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:40,758
- Son of a bitch!
- No, I'm sorry, it's not...

354
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,589
No, no... I'm not talking about you.

355
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,631
It'sjust some guy in your
country I owed a favortoo!

356
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,895
Son of a bitch! I'm ashamed!

357
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,996
Guns?!

358
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,272
I hate guns!

359
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,003
Stick with me, Carrera!

360
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,645
I'll give you my word that
this won't happen again.

361
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,653
Take the cap...
It's for you.

362
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,460
Yes, yes.

363
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:31,802
Carrera, Carrera, Carrera.

364
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,405
Good night, Paraguay.

365
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:42,315
Now, I am no longer Carrera...

366
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:47,818
I am now...
Russo, Renato Russo.

367
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:06,477
Take your hands off of me
I don't belong to you

368
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:11,949
You won't get me
With all that control

369
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:17,355
I may be alone
But I know exactly where I am

370
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:22,418
You may even doubt
I don't think that's love

371
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:26,993
Only this one?

372
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:31,331
Maybe it's just imagination

373
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:37,773
Maybe nothing will happen at all

374
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:42,540
Maybe that's all in vain

375
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:49,243
Do you think we will win?

376
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:55,617
Ô ô ô ô ô ô ô ô ô

377
00:34:56,894 --> 00:35:01,957
Why fight
If we don't mean to?

378
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:07,261
Who will protect us?

379
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:12,510
Maybe we will have to answer

380
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:17,812
For our mistakes
You and I

381
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,182
Thank you very much!

382
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,992
Thank you, Paraguay.

383
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,160
Close the back.

384
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:38,767
Cover everything!

385
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,629
Great! Where's Assis?

386
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,838
What's wrong Assis?

387
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,770
- What's up man?
- Booze.

388
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,844
You drunk, man?

389
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:55,143
Beat it, beat it!

390
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,947
You don't work here anymore man!

391
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:08,763
Edgar, I'm going to deliverthis myself,
you stay here by the plane.

392
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,165
Half an hour, there and back.

393
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,945
Baña, we have a problem man.

394
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,777
Assis is drunk...

395
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:30,719
I don't knowman,
I'm going to deliver it myself.

396
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:35,560
No problem, Baña. No problem,
everything'll work out.

397
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,755
Come on, let's go!

398
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,981
What's the matter bro?

399
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,516
- It's the engines.
- You knowanything about car engines?

400
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,351
More or less... but
I'm in a real rush, man.

401
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,986
Can't you move it over
to the side of the road?

402
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:10,544
It won't start!

403
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:14,492
- Could you give us a hand?
- What do you think it is?

404
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,517
I don't know, I don't know
anything about engines.

405
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,965
You don't have
a license either?

406
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,000
We're trying to get
around the roadblock too.

407
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,491
I'm going up to my boss's
farm up ahead man.

408
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,901
This road don't lead
to no farm, no way.

409
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,607
It ends at a lake.

410
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,176
Listen, I'm real sorry, but
I can't help you guys.

411
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:34,412
- I'mjust going to back up from here.
- I think it's the battery...

412
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,580
don't you have a rope
you can pull us with?

413
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,015
Nope, I'm loaded
with manure here.

414
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:40,108
Could I take a look at
that manure back there?

415
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,344
You lose, joker.

416
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,791
You called me boss?

417
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:54,460
You have to go
to Brazil to get Carrera.

418
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,291
OK, boss.

419
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,340
Let's get straight
to the point here...

420
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,673
Tell us, what's your
boss's name - uh, Dennis.

421
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,402
I don't have no boss, man.

422
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,945
- I work on my own, really.
- Right.

423
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,212
Silva?

424
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:22,116
Tell me something, who was
it that ordered the "manure"?

425
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,344
I'm going to read
a list of names...

426
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,914
to see if you recognize
anyone ofthem, OK?

427
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:49,449
Jair? Dotori?

428
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,946
Teká? Mantóva?

429
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:56,423
The names these guys have.
Tatuzinho?

430
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:01,399
Baña? Carrera? Soza?

431
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,800
- Hold it, stop!
- Soza?

432
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,769
- No the other guy. Carrera.
- Right.

433
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,428
You knowthis guy?

434
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,976
And you guys don't?!

435
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,486
Everybody fucking knows him.

436
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,988
Why would that be?

437
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,388
Carrera is the guy's son, right?

438
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:32,184
He's not his real son,
but it's like he was.

439
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,833
Like he brought him up
to be his heir, understand?

440
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:39,769
Heir? It says here he'sjust
another pilot.

441
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,031
Just another pilot?!

442
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:48,003
The guy's a fucking
good pilot.

443
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,214
Considered...

444
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:56,948
You remember when they attacked
that American base in Colombia?

445
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,254
The DEAbase.

446
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,418
You guys never hear
about that?

447
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,997
It was Carrera.

448
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:15,105
They had a F-16 fighter plane...

449
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,308
and an Apache helicopter
at the base.

450
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,503
One ofthem was
always in the air.

451
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:23,477
If any drugs were flown through the region,
the guys would shoot it down on the spot...

452
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,584
no kidding, just shoot it down.

453
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,019
One day they shot down a plane
belonging to Carrera's father.

454
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:31,510
They say that this really
pissed him off!

455
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:35,626
So what did he do?
He took ajet...

456
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:38,618
a normal jet, painted it all black.

457
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:42,487
And souped-up the turbines so
they'd spit firejust like a bomber...

458
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,423
and then waited.

459
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,505
One day the F16 landed...

460
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,039
before the helicopter
could take off,

461
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:53,533
this black bomber with
fire coming out, black, matte...

462
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,779
of its turbines flewby
and strafed the base.

463
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,609
And the Americans
couldn't believe it:

464
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:03,020
What the fuck? What the fuck?
Mayday, mayday!

465
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,088
And whatever.

466
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:07,683
Meanwhile a plane belonging
to Carrera's fatherflewby...

467
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,858
- full of cocaine.
- You ever hearthis story?

468
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,233
Everybody knows about it,
fucking great story!

469
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:17,334
They say that...

470
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:20,792
they want to make
a movie out ofit with that...

471
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:23,040
blond guy... who did...

472
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,564
Listen...

473
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:30,210
tell us what does this
Carrera guy look like?

474
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:38,217
I don't know.
I hear he's good looking...

475
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,018
good-looking guy.

476
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:45,618
They say he always wears
a Porshe Carrera cap.

477
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,924
Listen guys, his lawyer's
already called twice.

478
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:52,937
WARRANT FOR RELEASE
- But it looks like you...

479
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,531
ain't just no small fry,
huh, Dennis?

480
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,310
Awarrant for your release,
from Brasilia.

481
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,210
You got some heavy people
behind you, don't you man?

482
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,135
How does it look?
Handsome?

483
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:09,180
Can I go then?

484
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:10,918
Sure.

485
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,798
Listen, you can get out
ofthis life...

486
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:22,232
blanket immunity.
You ever hear ofit?

487
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,790
Lt'd be good foryou.

488
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:26,260
Can I go now?

489
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:34,042
Shit. We arrest them, the guys
upstairs set them free.

490
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:36,706
Call Samuca and tell him
to keep on his tail.

491
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:40,510
Samuca, the guy's leaving,
keep on his tail.

492
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,618
FEDERAL POLICE
- He's coming out, he's leaving.

493
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,264
Hey Carrera...

494
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,979
They caught him, bro.

495
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:14,944
- Fuck, it's not working...
- Fuck!

496
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,188
What's going on man?

497
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,329
Where are we going?

498
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,235
Take this, take this.

499
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:37,756
Look howhis eyes glow
with the light.

500
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:58,246
I could throwthis fish in
the frying pan right now...

501
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:02,675
but, as a good Christian
and I'm not hungry...

502
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:05,182
I'll throwhim back
in the water.

503
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,655
Take the bag, it's foryou.

504
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,540
Open it.

505
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:34,780
A prize for keeping
your mouth shut.

506
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:38,150
You don't have to pay me
for doing that.

507
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:42,059
You deserve it.
You don't refuse gifts!

508
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:44,323
Nobody evertaught you manners?

509
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:47,855
Take it, it's yours.

510
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,634
Thank you.

511
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,370
That's better.

512
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:59,773
Use it to take a vacation,
but don't spend it all.

513
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,369
Vacation?

514
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:08,948
Carrera is going to have
to disappear.

515
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:11,654
You've attracted
too much attention...

516
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:15,948
and ifthey come looking for
you they just might find me.

517
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,655
And besides, I don't want
to lose my best pilot.

518
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:24,832
Nobody can stop Carrera, boss.

519
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,265
If that fish I hooked could think...

520
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,474
it'd thinkjust like
you, Marcelo.

521
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,409
My name is Carrera.

522
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:49,158
Go on back to your
mother's house...

523
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,317

524
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:55,055
My mother?

525
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,293
Isn't her name Silvia?

526
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,566
Isn't she the one you
send money to?

527
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,400
Come on, Marcelo...

528
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,313
My name is Carrera.

529
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:15,683
You made Carrera up yourself.

530
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:35,865
Marcelo...

531
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,008
Son...

532
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:18,206
My dear, you...

533
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,109
Tell me, where have you been?

534
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,950
With whom have you been?

535
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:31,151
I knowyou are the one
sending me money.

536
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,821
I knowit's you.

537
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,797
I'm a plane pilot mom.

538
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,850
Who got you into flying?

539
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:01,558
You've always been like this,
ever since you were a kid...

540
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,294
Always been Like this,
haven't you?

541
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:05,852

542
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:11,958

You're like... it's... Is this

547
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:29,976
Do you want...

548
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:35,322
You want to be a nobody
all your life? Is that it?

549
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:40,261
You got the key here?

550
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:43,457
Is the door open?

551
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:49,164
It's open...

552
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:10,489
Whiskey please.

553
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:17,958
Straight.

554
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:23,039
Breaking news.

555
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:26,543
One of the most wanted
traffickers in Brazil...

556
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:29,880
was arrested this morning
by the Federal Police.

557
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,249
The pilot was transporting
around two hundred kilos...

558
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:35,582
of cocaine in
a single-prop plane.

559
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:37,821
Carrera, a dangerous drug smuggler...

560
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,423
wanted by international police...

561
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:44,528
is suspected of having delivered
a heavy blowto the American DEA base...

562
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:48,165
Making him one of the most
well-known traffickers...

563
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,966
on the Brazil Paraguay border.

564
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:53,436
The investigation was
already going on for 4 months...

565
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:56,701
was made in cooperation between
the Brazilian Federal Police and...

566
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,615
I've got some
medicine if you want...

567
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:10,852
Need any help?

568
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,953
Jesus Christ, son!

569
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,452
What are you doing with your life?

570
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,589
You were right.

571
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:27,304
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

572
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:30,364
No, no, I'm sorry.
You were right.

573
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,803
It's OK son, OK.

574
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:39,547
Get a grip on yourself, son.
You want to wind up like Gonzalez...

575
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,485
sitting inside a bathroom
smelling shit the whole day?

576
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:44,788
Did you knowhe used to be
an important bullfighter in Mexico?

577
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:47,257
He told me that the biggest
mistake he's ever made in his life...

578
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:49,248
was not having died
in the arena.

579
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:52,729
And that is why
he's a nobody, nothing.

580
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,924
Look at me, son, look at me!

581
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:59,536
In Mexico, they say that when
a bullfighter dies in the arena...

582
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:01,338
it wasn't the bull who killed him,

583
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:03,772
it was the bullfighter
who let himselfbe killed.

584
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:07,676
I think you knowwhat you
have to do now, don't you?

585
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,180
Weirdo?

586
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:23,920
Is that you Weirdo, man!

587
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,062
You're mistaking me
for someone else.

588
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:29,122
I already knew...
For sure, it's you Weirdo!

589
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:33,565
No way! I don't know
any Weirdo man!

590
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:43,702
I'll have another one too please.

GOL TAKES OVER BRAZILIAN SKIES

592
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,675
If you hadn't left, I would never
have let you do this to your hair.

593
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,358

business man from Sao Paulo...

599
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,271
But for security reasons...

600
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,239
I can't say who he is.

601
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:44,374
HELICOPTER RENTER
- The only thing I can say is...

602
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:46,009
that he is from aviation business.

603
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,840
Too bad there? Too cold?

604
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:51,441
It is already heating up, it will
be hot in a few seconds.

605
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,586
Great! He needs two bodyguards...

606
00:55:56,586 --> 00:56:00,990
they have to be wearing a white shirt,
a black suit and tie.

607
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,326
Ok? Perfect!

608
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:06,022
Ah... and they
can't be afraid of flying.

609
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,064
No need to hire a pilot...

610
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:09,566
my boss is going to fly,

611
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,932
he's an ace, one
ofthe best pilots there...

612
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,970
One ofthe best pilots ever.

613
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,573
Any problem if we pay
in cash, dollar?

614
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,808
And how do you want your hair?
Look, isn't this nice.

615
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:20,377

616
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:23,312
You don't have any
gray hairyet, do you?

617
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,082

00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:31,477
Howabout something like this?

621
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:35,614
What? You want it like that.

622
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:38,995
That's so nice, son.

623
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:42,089
Successful businessman style,
mommy can do that. You want that?

624
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:46,202
Such good taste you have!

625
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:49,501
- Will it be the same?
- No. It'll be better, you'll see.

626
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,231
I like that!

627
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:53,410
I'm going to have
to dye your hair?

628
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,078
Get this bleached blond out...

629
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,875
and do away with
your sideburns too.

630
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,739
Sideburns, you have to be kidding.

631
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:05,312
Honey, will you be staying
here for carnival, with me?

632
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,689
No.

633
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,686
You are going to travel again?

634
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:12,956
I'm going to travel.

635
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:14,853
Jeez.

636
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,163
May I cut here?

637
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:11,354
Mr. Valter, Mrs. Sandra, welcome.

638
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:12,722
You reserved a bungalow

639
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:14,451
Yes, everything ok.

640
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:19,027
And who's that guy there?
Nobody else is scheduled to arrive!

641
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,368
- Who is this guy?
- Come on, Sandra.

642
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,131
I've no idea.

643
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:09,569
No, talk to the people
over in marketing Rubens.

644
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:12,077
I can't believe it, a palm tree
right in front of our sign.

645
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,014
Yeah...

646
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:17,511
and nobody can
see our name written on it.

647
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:20,050
Ok, Rubens.

648
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:22,725
But don't say anything to my brother...

649
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,716
it'll only make him upset.

650
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:30,997
We'll cut down all the trees.

651
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,696
Yeah right, OK then.
All my best. Bye.

652
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:37,407
How's it going? Howare you?
Is the lobby that way?

653
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,705
- Please.
- Excuse me.

654
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:45,548
Eike, the owner
of Gol Airlinesjust arrived.

655
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:47,812
- What? Constantino is here? But...
- It's his brother.

656
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:50,010
Hold on, I'll be right there.

657
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,957
So sell it nowthat's good.

658
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:56,323
No, it's a safe transaction.

659
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:00,962
Who is he?

660
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:21,312
I can't believe it!
Constantino!

661
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:22,979
Eike!

662
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:28,357
Good afternoon, this is
Miranda, from Gol Airlines.

663
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:31,761
I'm great, thanks...

664
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:34,321
I'm returning a call from Amaury.

665
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:38,833
Right, to knowif you all are going
to be in the lounge in Recife.

666
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,363
No, it's Henrique who'll be going.

667
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:47,176
I can't guarantee
that because you know...

668
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:50,509
he likes to keep a lowprofile
and he's sort of...

669
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,410
but who knows they can't work
out something on the spot.

670
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,849
That'd be great.

671
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:01,253
OK, fine.

672
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:02,891
So, we'll see you there, then.

673
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,654
Hey, can I take a photo?

674
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,228
Girls, girls!

675
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,868

679
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:59,515
That is very nice!
Yeah, like that. That's it!

680
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:01,210
This'll make the front
coverfor sure, huh!?

681

686
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:32,209
- I really don't think it's right...
- Give me that, Sandra!

687
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:39,688
Renato Jaques?

688
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:49,632
- Hey, Eike! Howare you?
- Hey, Renato! Are you having a good time?

689
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:51,601
- A lot!

690
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,398
Good night. Nice people!

691
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:57,473
Constantino all by himselfthere.

692
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:01,102
- I'm going overto save our sponsor.
- Who? Hold it!

693
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:04,245
- That is Constantino?!
- Sure!

694
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:08,484
Good night, Constantino...

695
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:11,087
Howare you, Henrique,
nice to meet you.

696
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:12,789
Great. Howare you?

697
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,123
- Renato Jaques.
- Renato...

698
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,826
- Constantino, I'm so sorry.
- What for?

699
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:18,961
Jeez, I didn't recognize
you there! Real sorry.

700
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:22,365
No way, Renato, I talked to you
because I'm a big fan of yours.

701
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,966
Valter! I was looking
foryou, stay here with me!

702
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:25,067
Hold it Sandra.

703
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:26,602
I'm going over to say hi
to Henrique Constantino there, look.

704
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:28,502
- Henrique Is here? Where?
- I'll be right back.

705
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,830
Jeez... that's not him!
You'll make a fool out of yourself!

706
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:34,911
What's that face like,
the one you use in the soap?!

707
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,313
No way... I'm working on
a newproject now...

708
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,848
- Constantino.
- Hello.

709
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,049
- Howare you?
- Fine.

710
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:42,711
- Valter Meireles.
- Valter. Haven't we met before?

711
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,917
Didn't we have dinner
once together, in Brasilia?

712
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:48,356
- Yeah, I think so...
- At Roberto's house.

713
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:50,393
- Right.
- Wasn't that it... the senator...

714
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:51,527
Yeah, you're right.

715
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:53,529
Howare you?
How's your wife, uh...

716
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:54,730
- Sandra.
- Sandra!

717
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,365
I think I sawher around
here somewhere, right?

718
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:57,466
Yeah, she's here...

719
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:59,802
but, in reality, I'd like to ask you
something aboutjets.

720
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:01,571
After all, you know
all about them, right?

721
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:02,705
Athing or two.

722
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:04,941
It'sjust that I'm thinking about
trading mine in for another one.

723
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:07,009
It's getting on my nerves,
a whistling sound...

724
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:10,274
What you have? A Learjet 24D?

725
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:11,981
Who told you?

726
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:13,249
It's because the 24D
starts making a noise,

727
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:14,682
like that when it gets up to around,

728
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:17,086
- let's say, forty thousand feet.
- Precisely.

729
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:18,321
But ifl were you, I'd keep it.

730
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:19,989
- You think so?
- It's a greatjet.

731
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:22,091
Could you take it out for a spin,
to see what you think?

732
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:23,426
- Sure, wheneveryou want.
- Excuse me, Valter...

733
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:24,560
- Is it here?
- Yes.

734
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,653
Excuse me. Just a second.

735
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,757
- Could I talk to you?
- Sure.

736
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,201
Come on there!

737
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:34,237
- Eike, great party.
- Thank you.

738
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:36,068
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

739
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,969
Let me tell you something...

740
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:43,478
Jeez, keep away from that guy
Valter Meirelles.

741
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,146
He's a real jerk.

742
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:47,817
But, wait, isn't Valterthe owner
of... what's that factory?

743
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:49,218
He's the owner of nothing.

744
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,812
You're the owner...
you and your brother...

745
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:54,290
Valter is flat broke.

746
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,226
The money there all belongs
to his wife, Sandra, poor thing.

747
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,557
Why "poor thing"?

748
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:02,531
Depression. Sandra is crazy,
right, man?

749
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:04,500
Spends all her time locked up
in institutes. Forget about them man.

750
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,831
Look...

751
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:10,138
You wanna have some fun?

752
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,241
Yeah.

753
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,043
So, let's go man,
to the scene ofthe crime.

754
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:15,237
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

755
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:22,011
I'll introduce you
to some girls, come on.

756
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:25,747
I'd like to introduce you to the owner
ofthis party here Constantino...

757
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:28,858
- Henrique... Lu Paes...
- How's it going?

758
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:30,426
- Great, and you?
- My pleasure.

759
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:33,418
- Nice meeting you.
- We're all friends now!

760
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,189
Come on, come on!

761
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,663
I told you we would have fun...

762
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:47,971
We decorated there...

763
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:50,373
I like those...

764
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:52,878
- palm trees...
- Beautiful!

765
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:19,498
I can't believe the shorts
that guy is wearing, look.

766
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:23,135
What about them?

767
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:26,876
Listen, that guy there is
Henrique Constantino, you jerk.

768
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,344
He should dress betterthen,
don't you think?

769
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:33,137
Come on, you think he's
like your playboy friends?

770
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,485
Henrique is a real
down-to-earth guy, look.

771
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:38,854
I'm going to show him
my turnstile project, you'll see.

772
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:41,015
That guy there is
going to fix me up.

773
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:45,293
Well, he's shorts are
kinda cute, aren't they?

774
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:47,329
- Nowyou're getting the idea.
- I thought that...

775
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:50,800
- No, I'm here with...
- Ellen, no "H", double "L".

776
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,064
- With Ellen without an "H".
- Double "L".

777
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,407
What's going on?

778
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:01,944
Henrique Constantino,
he's rescheduling Ellen's ticket.

779
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:04,208
- Can you pack your bag in five minutes?
- Of course she can!

780
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,616
- She's on her way then, OK?
- Ohh thanks a million!

781
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:09,885
Really, thanks, if you need me
I'll be around...

782
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:11,352
- have fun...
- Alright.

783
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,690
- It's been so long.
- Eike! Eike!

784
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:16,058
- Listen, this is serious!
- Hold itjust a sec. Hi?

785
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:18,260
That guy there,
he's not Constantino...

786
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,662
he's pulling some kind of scam.

787
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:22,031
The guy's not Constantino?

788
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:23,599
- Isn't he Constantino?
- No.

789
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,701
He'sjust rescheduled
an impossible flight...

790
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:27,328
and he's not Constantino?
Sandra...

791
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,038
Isn't it a bit early
to get started, honey?

792
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:30,239
Do me a favor and take care
of yourself, huh?

793
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:32,901
I've got work to do.
Hi... Hi...

794
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:38,836
CALLING HENRIQUE CONSTANTINO

795
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:44,684
Sandra. Having a nice time?

796
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:46,850
Eike's some
character, isn't he?

797
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:51,282
I'm going out for a walk on the beach,
why don't you come with me?

798
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:54,321
You've got some nerve!

799
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:59,496
I'm sorry, Sandra, I knowyou're married
and all, I didn't mean...

800
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:02,037
- to bother you...
- It doesn't have anything to do with that...

801
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:03,772
- You didn't understand what I said.
- I... Valter's a friend of mine, sorry.

802
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:05,040
You didn't understand what I said

803
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,338
It'sjust that I sawyou...

804
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:09,712
and I thought...

805
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:11,304
I'm sorry.

806
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:18,621
What's up?

807
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:20,612
I'll be back soon.
I'm here with Constantino.

808
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:24,155
Let's go party? Come on!

809
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:27,596
Howare you?

810
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:28,961
- Are you ok?
- Howare you?

811
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:41,541
Are you ok?

812
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:45,804
I want some attention too.

813
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:49,809
Excuse me, can I enjoy myself
a bit? Could I do that?

814
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:19,848
I'm sorry, but I just can't
leave you here all by yourself.

815
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:21,873
Who said I am by myself?

816
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:28,521
I don't think he'll be
coming back too soon...

817
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:37,824
Want to dance?

818
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,196
No...

819
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:45,171
Let's go!

820
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:54,539
Hi...

821
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,720
I'm dancing with my
friend here right now.

822
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:09,155
Who are you?

823
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:11,899
Henrique...
We've already met.

824
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:16,501
I know Henrique Constantino.
But I want to knowyour name.

825
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:18,107
You'rejust not connecting
the name to the person.

826
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,098
It happens to me sometimes too.

827
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:22,070
You must be crazy, huh?

828
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:28,883
If you weren't married, I think
I'd kiss you right now.

829
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:31,751
Would you?

830
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:38,327
Excuse me, Constantino.
Howare you?

831
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:41,630
Sandra, nice seeing you
again. I'm sorry.

832
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:44,133
Everything ok?
Nice to meet you.

833
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:47,227
We're going on live here and...

834
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,438
I thought we could have
a quick talk, could we do that?

835
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:50,639
- Sure.
- How's that sound?

836
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,007
- Sure.
- Right now...

837
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:53,075
- Ready?
- In ten seconds.

838
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:55,509
- Tem seconds.
- 3, 2...

839
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:59,882
And to continue our coverage
ofthe carnival here in Recife,

840
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:02,785
I'd like to introduce you all
to Henrique Constantino.

841
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:06,414
Who happens to be Constantino's brother.
The president of Gol Airlines.

842
01:12:06,588 --> 01:12:08,924
Henrique thank you so
much for being here.

843
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:10,793
Congratulations about
the success of your company.

844
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:12,861
I was wondering if you could
explain to everyone watching us,

845
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:14,797
howGol Airlines
has managed to grow...

846
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:17,095
despite this crisis
affecting everybody?

847
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:20,102
In reality, there's no secret at all.

848
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:22,171
We base ourselves on
the basic principle...

849
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,006
of never owing anything
to anybody.

850
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:27,703
Constantino??
Gol Airline owner?!

851
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:31,104
This guy is Dennis! I held this guy!

852
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:35,918
And this is the first time that Gol Airlines
participate in a carnival party?

853
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:37,353
Yes, the first time...

854
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,621
but I think we'll be
participating more and more...

855
01:12:39,621 --> 01:12:43,092
because this party here
is great, huh? Just fantastic.

856
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:45,794
So, congratulations again,

What is it?
Did I say something stupid?

01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:26,433
No. You talked like the
real heir of Gol Airlines.

867
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:55,627

01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:10,913
- Make our getaway, why?
- And jets, you knowhowto fly ajet?

873
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:13,438
Or did you only learn howto fly
helicopters forthis scam?

874
01:14:13,849 --> 01:14:16,652
- Scam?
- Yeah, you knowhowto fly one or not?

875
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:19,054

Sorry for calling this late,
but could you get my jet ready.

01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:36,499
Yeah, right now, now...

881
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:39,274
No, you don't need
to call the pilot, no.

882
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:40,442
Sandra...

883
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:43,104

OK, thanks, thanks!

886
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,019
What are you talking about?

887
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:52,855
That interviewyou gave was live.

888
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:56,188
Howlong do you think it'll take
the cops to come looking for you?

889
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:58,760
- The cops?
- Yeah, the cops!

890
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,195
- Are you crazy?
- Me?

891
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:03,632
You're the crazy one, trying to pull a scam
on all ofhigh-society here.

892
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:06,226
Tell me, what's in it foryou, huh?

893
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:08,270
What are you talking about, Sandra?

894
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,739
Look, I went to school
with Constantino, in Brasilia.

895
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:13,537
I knowhim. What's your name?

896
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:17,145

898
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:21,617
Shit, aren't you going to tell me?
You going to keep on trying to fool me?

01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:23,085
I won't turn you in.

900
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:25,383
I want to help you, who are you?

901
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:27,346
Ahh! Let's go, come.

902
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:29,270
Fuck!

903
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,745
Hey Constantino...

904
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:39,080
Hey, man.

905
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:42,646
What's up?

906
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:50,025
- What's the matter?
- It's...

907
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:53,057
Go on overto your room for a bit.

908
01:17:56,304 --> 01:17:58,033
What's going on?

909
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:02,606
Man, they're trying
to fuck up my father, shit.

910
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,105
What?

911
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:11,086
- Can I use your phone?
- Of course, sure.

912
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:13,520
Go on, right beside the bed.
Dial zero first.

913
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:19,324
Fucking-A!

914
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:21,191
Hi, is my fatherthere?

915
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:25,100

916
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,668

917
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:28,363
- Excuse me, I knowhe's in there.
- Who, Constantino?

918
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:30,105
Let me tell you something.

919
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:31,707
- He's working...
- you have his agenda?

920
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:33,175
Do you think
I'm as stupid as you?

921
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:34,472
- Excuse me.
- Wait, Sandra!

922
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:39,314
I want to talk to you. Could you
excuse us for a minute please?

923
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:42,340
Just a second, OK? Please.

924
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:47,620
Constantino, I'm going out for a walk.
I told you she was crazy.

925
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,981
Who do you think you are?

926
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:53,927
I'm working right now.

927
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:56,460
I just want to knowyour name.

928
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:02,870
Henrique Constantino.

929
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,164
Ohh... stop that!

930
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:08,840
You got any whiskey?

931
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,062
What are you doing?

932
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:31,295
Hello? What did she say to you?

933
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,062
No, it's...

934
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,127
a friend...

935
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,508
Somebody I met.

936
01:19:42,677 --> 01:19:45,771
Tell my father that they're
trying to screwus here,

937
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:48,615
trying to fuck us up, and
tell him I want to meet him later.

938
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:51,448
At Santos Dumont, in Rio.

939
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:55,688
No, I won't be going alone.
I'll ask Renato Jaques to go with me.

940
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,249
Fine?

941
01:20:35,697 --> 01:20:37,892
Is everything fine with you?

942
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:43,569
Fine!

943
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:49,974
Hold it, hold it Constantino.

944
01:20:56,484 --> 01:20:59,554
What's going on? Don't you think
the guys might want to kill you?

945
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:01,356
Mrs Sandra, this guy you've
been hanging out with,

946
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,925
besides impersonating rich
businessmen is a drug trafficker...

947
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:06,985
ho works for one ofthe biggest drug
cartels in Latin America.

948
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:09,720
It's not the bull who
kills the bullfighter...

949
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:15,230
it's the bullfighter who
lets himselfbe killed.

950
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:20,265
He kept saying he was
Constantino, he needs help.

951
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:23,601
Paulo? Henrique Constantino.

952
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:27,449
- Is the plane fueled up?
- Yes, it is.

953
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:29,713
- And Mrs. Sandra? She said...
- Have you met Renato Jaques?

954
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:32,415
Nice meeting you.

955
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:34,247
Can we board?

956
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:36,024
- Mrs. Sandra, she...
- She's not coming.

957
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:38,593
I'm going to have to call her, she said
that you'd be leaving together...

958
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:42,324
Sure, of course. If you don't believe
the owner of Gol Airlines,

959
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:44,099
you'd better call.

960
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:45,634
No, no, it's not that,
Mr. Renato, it'sjust...

961
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:49,471
Look, Paulo, if you're going
to call, call now, man,

962
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:51,640
cause I've got to shoot again one
whole episode ofthe soap opera,

963
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,268
he's going to Rio and
isjust doing me a favor.

964
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:56,711
She's probably asleep
by nowtoo, so...

965
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:57,735
- Excuse me.
- Let's go, come on.

966
01:21:58,046 --> 01:22:01,116
Sandra, Paulo says that you lent
thejet to the drug dealer.

967
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:02,550
- He got away?
- Where did he go to?

968
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:03,818
- To Rio?
- To Rio?

969
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:06,121
- Renato Jaques? The actor?
- The actor.

970
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:07,255
Call headquarters in Rio.

971
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:09,883
And tell them to play it cool,
hejust might be holding a hostage.

972
01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:29,241
Is that him?

973
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:39,285
What's the matter?

974
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:42,212
Those guys are out to get me.

975
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:45,790
Let's go easy, Renato Jaques
might be a hostage.

976
01:22:46,328 --> 01:22:49,197
Renato, you have to help me now.

977
01:22:49,197 --> 01:22:51,866
You hold them back, don't let
them get nearthe plane.

978
01:22:51,866 --> 01:22:53,766
I'm going to call my father
on the radio, OK?

979
01:22:54,002 --> 01:22:55,570
Hold it, just a second.

980
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:57,672
Howam I supposed to hold
these guys back, shit?

981
01:22:57,672 --> 01:22:59,139
I'mjust an actor.

982
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:03,243
You're a good actor...

983
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:05,710
What's he doing?

984
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:11,586
He's going to take off!

985
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:15,022
He's closing the door, hold him!
Don't let him!

986
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:17,650
Take it easy.

987
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:28,269
- He's turning on the motors...
- Go, go!

988
01:23:28,269 --> 01:23:30,772
- Calm down...
- Police! Help!

989
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:32,501
Police!

990
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:36,436
Hold it, hold it there!

991
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:38,870
Here, here!

992
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:50,556
What the fuck?

993
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:06,872
Juliete, Kilo, Quebec, requesting
authorization to take off...

994
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:11,302
Tell them it's code red.
Zero, seventy-seven.

995
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:19,814
Code red, zero, seventy-seven.

996
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:25,855
- You want to take over?
- You're the pilot.

997
01:24:26,494 --> 01:24:29,554
What's the emergency, Juliete,
Kilo, Quebec, do you read?

998
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:33,091
Tell them you've got a kidney
onboard for a transplant...

999
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:35,336
and that the patient
is in a critical state.

1000
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:40,473
It'll work Kohai.

1001
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:45,470
Let's go Marcelo.

1002
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,285
No dad.

1003
01:24:55,723 --> 01:24:57,623
My name is Henrique.

1004
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:00,994
Henrique? Who's Henrique?

1005
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:14,901
Dad,

1006
01:25:18,246 --> 01:25:20,441
I'm your son, aren't I?

1007
01:25:21,816 --> 01:25:24,876
I don't know.
Are you Marcelo?

1008
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:36,820
New York.

01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:38,933

1012
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:47,840
Did I say it right?

1013
01:25:58,887 --> 01:26:00,788
Juliette, Kilo, Quebec...

1014
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:02,653

1015
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,417

1018
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:45,428

My name is Marcelo.

1020
01:26:57,645 --> 01:26:59,806
NINE MONTHS LATER

1021
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:03,918
- The rebellion begun...

1023
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:06,554

- Nice.

1024
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:08,890
- This color is so good on you.

1025
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:11,259
- Very good. My, it looks great.
- Oh good.

1026
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:13,494
And thanks for seeing
me this time of night, OK?

1027
01:27:13,494 --> 01:27:15,894
- No problem.
- Tell me, how's Marcelo?

1028
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:19,957
Marcelo's fine.
Full of special privileges...

1029
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:24,205
a bunch oflawyers offering
to take his case for free.

1030
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:25,940
- Really, that's great, huh?
- Yeah.

1031
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:27,108
Fancy prisoner.

1032
01:27:27,108 --> 01:27:28,743
- Sílvia I've got to run.
- Ok, go.

1033
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:30,545
- I'll pay you next week, OK?
- No problem.

1034
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:32,280
- Kisses, bye.
- Bye and have fun...

1035
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:33,975
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1036
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:42,617
The situation of the Bangu 3
prison, remains very tense...

1037
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:44,886
all of the attempts to put
an end to the rebellion...
haven't worked out.

1038
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:47,121
The commander of BOPE
has just informed us,

1039
01:28:47,121 --> 01:28:48,122
that they will have to invade.

1040
01:28:48,122 --> 01:28:50,224
Because the situation
is out of control.

1041
01:28:50,224 --> 01:28:54,126
Soon back with more information.

1042
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:11,173
What's up? Come back here, brother!

1043
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:16,114
This shit will explode like this!
The pigs are going to come in...

1044
01:29:17,051 --> 01:29:19,246
they're going to bust in Mico...

1045
01:29:19,721 --> 01:29:20,949
What?

1046
01:29:21,155 --> 01:29:22,679
You up front?

1047
01:29:23,624 --> 01:29:26,286
What you think? Beat it.

1048
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:30,164
Mico, this whole place is going
to explode, the pigs are going...

1049
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:32,792
Hold it. What the fuck do you want?

1050
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,469
You work for the Krauts?

1051
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:36,270
I told you to beat it, weirdo!

1052
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:40,104
My name is Juliano de Souza.
And my command is in São Paulo.

1053
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:43,277
And my guys there are all buddies
with your guy on the phone.

1054
01:29:46,247 --> 01:29:48,215
- You with the PCC, bro?
- Give me the fucking phone.

1055
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:51,476
Listen Mico, there's this...

1056
01:29:53,988 --> 01:29:57,355
Mico, this is Juliano from the PCC.

1057
01:29:57,692 --> 01:29:59,956
If you enter, he will be killed.

1058
01:30:00,628 --> 01:30:02,357
Tell him to drop the guy.

1059
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:05,222
Drop the guy!

1060
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:07,435
The perimeter is surrounded.

1061
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:10,495
Free the hostages
or we'll break in.

1062
01:30:13,374 --> 01:30:14,509
What is it?

1063
01:30:14,509 --> 01:30:16,611
We want to settle this
nice and easy, captain.

1064
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:19,580
- "We" who boy?
- The "Comando" and the PCC.

1065
01:30:19,947 --> 01:30:22,250
You with the PCC?
What's your name?

1066
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,411
My name is Juliano de Souza, Captain.

1067
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:27,750
We want to do this peacefully,
nobody has to use force.

1068
01:30:28,456 --> 01:30:30,658
We want is to give our
message to the press...

1069
01:30:30,658 --> 01:30:32,527
And then, we'll let
the hostages go.

1070
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:34,722
And how do I know
you're telling the truth?

1071
01:30:36,497 --> 01:30:39,057
Look here in my eye
and see if I'm lying.
