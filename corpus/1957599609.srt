1
00:00:01,381 --> 00:00:02,647
(waves crashing)
(seagulls squawking)

2
00:00:02,647 --> 00:00:05,230
(gentle music)

3
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,787
(gentle upbeat music)

4
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:51,557
Come on, let's jog to the car.

5
00:00:51,557 --> 00:00:52,568
No way.

6
00:00:52,568 --> 00:00:55,187
I feel like I just gave birth yesterday.

7
00:00:55,187 --> 00:00:56,390
He was sleeping.

8
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,250
Whenever we're moving, never fails.

9
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,124
Merry first Christmas, Clayton Stolpa.

10
00:01:00,124 --> 00:01:02,288
(Jim and Jennifer laughing)

11
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:03,983
You know every time we walk here

12
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:05,923
I think about the senior prom.

13
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,340
Yeah, we only spent like 15 minutes there

14
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,984
before we came here.

15
00:01:09,984 --> 00:01:12,333
Are you sorry? (laughs)

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,778
I still say we should have worn matching tuxedos.

17
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:19,010
(Jim and Jennifer laughing)

18
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,843
I love my presents.

19
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:20,676
Yeah, me too.

20
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,213
I love you.

21
00:01:25,323 --> 00:01:27,890
Come on, there's no one around.

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,789
I, I always think it'll sound funny.

23
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,863
I show it, don't I?

24
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,700
Yes.
Well?

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,307
But saying it is a really nice way to show it.

26
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,227
(Clayton cries)

27
00:01:39,227 --> 00:01:41,450
Oh, well, someone's showing hunger.

28
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,470
Come on, better get going.

29
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,833
If we're late, Mom will call 911.

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,273
I'm trying.

31
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,743
(gentle upbeat music)

32
00:01:51,743 --> 00:01:54,493
(birds chirping)

33
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:05,772
(car door clicks)

34
00:02:05,772 --> 00:02:08,919
Oh, Jimmy, Jen, thank God.

35
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,720
I saw that rain down south

36
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,784
and I was sure you had an accident.

37
00:02:11,784 --> 00:02:14,470
(laughs) Mom.

38
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,450
Mom, we beat the rain.

39
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,030
We're exactly nine minutes late.

40
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,596
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

41
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,536
(Jim laughs)

42
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:21,880
You're late.
Oh, yeah.

43
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,730
We stopped at the beach on the way.

44
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,329
Reliving old times.

45
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:27,009
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

46
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:28,299
How you doing?
Good.

47
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:29,132
You look great.
Yeah, you too.

48
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:30,620
So does that baby.

49
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,712
You've grown another six inches.

50
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:33,739
Yes.

51
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:35,204
Hello.

52
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:36,876
Yes, yeah.
Hey, Clayton.

53
00:02:36,876 --> 00:02:38,721
Look at that guy.

54
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:41,210
(Muriel cooing)

55
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,520
And there's my little half sister

56
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,360
who's grown at least seven inches.

57
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,192
Wait a minute.

58
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,829
Look what I got you for a Christmas present.

59
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:52,420
Well, he's big.

60
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,990
Nice.

61
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,027
Thanks.

62
00:02:55,027 --> 00:02:56,491
(dog barking)

63
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:57,324
Hey, Pooh.

64
00:02:58,555 --> 00:02:59,388
Hey, Pooh.

65
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,200
Ooh, they grow up fast.

66
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,760
You'll see.

67
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,073
Oh, it's great to see you kids.

68
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:07,467
Hi.
Hi.

69
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:12,279
Come on, give me that.

70
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:16,026
(Kevin chattering)

71
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:16,859
(Jennifer laughing)

72
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:19,160
Come on, come on.
Pooh, come on.

73
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,304
Come on, Megan.

74
00:03:21,304 --> 00:03:22,137
Get in there!

75
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:24,060
I can't believe how big he's getting.

76
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,200
Is he still nursing?

77
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,320
Down to once a day.

78
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,460
He's got two teeth now.

79
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,293
Ouch.

80
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:29,896
Yes!

81
00:03:29,896 --> 00:03:34,456
But we're still nursing and I'm just loving it.

82
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:35,289
(Jim laughs)

83
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:37,061
I am almost five now.

84
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:38,673
Gee, I thought it would remind you of Pooh.

85
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,677
Do the satellites you work with,

86
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:44,010
are they spy satellites?

87
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,593
Do they have giant cameras?

88
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,750
Uh, Megan, it's a secret.

89
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,829
Megan, would you please go get Jimmy

90
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:53,290
some more cider in the kitchen?

91
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,123
Great idea.

92
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:56,600
Here, thanks.

93
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,873
Thank you.
(Jim laughs)

94
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:00,727
Have you given any more thought

95
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:02,130
to coming to work with me?

96
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,120
Even on Christmas day there's sports on radio, TV, cable.

97
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,250
Sports promotion is a good business.

98
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,300
Well, that's definitely part of our master plan.

99
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,100
And uh, whatever it is I'm working on in the army,

100
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,563
it's excellent training.

101
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:16,420
My God, another one so soon.

102
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,216
She's just weaning this one.

103
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,170
Not that soon.

104
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,003
I'm not pregnant.

105
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:21,440
We're planning two, Mom.

106
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,200
We have it all worked out.

107
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,430
Jim, you've been 21 for two weeks.

108
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,370
Jen's even younger.

109
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,050
You're babies having babies.

110
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,900
Kevin
Oh, Mom.

111
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,433
I know, but kids are a big responsibility.

112
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:33,267
We're aware of that.

113
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:35,293
But we're young, we're not, we're not crazy.

114
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:36,209
We're not irresponsible.

115
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,318
I didn't say that.
We like being parents

116
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,032
and raising children, why is that bad?

117
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:39,865
It isn't bad.

118
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:41,429
And I'm not talking about irresponsible.

119
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:42,990
So what's the problem?
Well, I just think

120
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,190
you're too, is anybody answering that phone?

121
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:47,590
I guess I am.

122
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,220
Never hurts to take some time to grow.

123
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,570
Put some money in the bank.

124
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,130
No harm smelling the roses.

125
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,730
We want a big family while we're still young.

126
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,710
This is roses to us.

127
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,440
In my experience babies and roses

128
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,790
don't smell quite the same.

129
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:04,040
James scores his second touchdown.

130
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,927
He's caught six balls for 119 years.

131
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:08,626
What?

132
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:09,459
Mom, what?

133
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,060
That was Uncle Clay.

134
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,340
Grandma had a heart episode.

135
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,223
Whatever that is.

136
00:05:16,602 --> 00:05:18,960
Does the doctor say it's serious?

137
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,793
No, but he said the same thing about Dad,

138
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,143
and before I got there he was gone.

139
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,193
I, I never had a chance to say goodbye.

140
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,310
Kevin, I gotta get to Idaho right away.

141
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,010
I'm so sorry about Christmas

142
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,982
but I just have be with her.
No, no, that's all right.

143
00:05:40,982 --> 00:05:42,530
It's all right, it's all right, don't worry about it.

144
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,436
You'll, you'll get there tomorrow,

145
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:46,145
and she'll tell you that you worry too much,

146
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,210
the way she always does, okay?

147
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,270
It'll be okay.

148
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,840
Grandma was so proud of when I enlisted.

149
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,320
Maybe we should go with, with Ma and Kevin.

150
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,295
It's only a 14 hour drive to Pocatello.

151
00:05:57,295 --> 00:05:58,610
Yeah, right.

152
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,307
I was in the army too, remember?

153
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:02,657
And no sergeant would give you a pass for that.

154
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,310
Ma's just such a worrier,

155
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,210
I feel like I should be there for her.

156
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,110
Kevin's there, he's great.

157
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,353
She'll be fine.

158
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,813
So much rain this winter.

159
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,130
Maybe it'll end the drought.

160
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,510
You doing your diary?

161
00:06:23,935 --> 00:06:25,690
There's a lot to catch up on.

162
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,313
Finally have a peaceful moment.

163
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:30,578
Read it.

164
00:06:30,578 --> 00:06:31,840
No way.
Come on, read it.

165
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,084
No.
Just read a little bit.

166
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:34,353
No, too many secrets.

167
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,457
(Jennifer laughs)

168
00:06:37,457 --> 00:06:40,040
(horn honking)

169
00:06:40,936 --> 00:06:43,855
Do you think we're too young to be good parents?

170
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:45,330
I mean both our parents had us young

171
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,750
and their marriages blew up, both divorced.

172
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,480
We've got a tiny apartment, no money,

173
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,880
a car that barely runs.

174
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,930
Age and money have nothing to do with it.

175
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,043
It's about commitment and that word, that L word.

176
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,620
But if we don't give them the very best possible start,

177
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,254
are we hurting them?

178
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:05,947
I couldn't bear that.

179
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:08,530
(horn honking)

180
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,764
It'll be okay.

181
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:15,621
(gentle music)

182
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:21,860
(computer whirring)

183
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,517
(group chattering)

184
00:07:25,517 --> 00:07:27,232
Private Stolpa.

185
00:07:27,232 --> 00:07:28,228
Yes, Sergeant.

186
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:30,145
Telephone.

187
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,090
Work on that isolator.

188
00:07:36,342 --> 00:07:38,842
(door clicks)

189
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:42,247
It's Stolpa.

190
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:43,080
Hi.
Hi.

191
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,140
Your mom just called from Idaho.

192
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,664
Grandma died.

193
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:50,497
I'm sorry.

194
00:07:50,497 --> 00:07:52,060
Oh, no.

195
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,140
How's she taking it?
Not too well.

196
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,565
By the time she got to the hospital it was too late.

197
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:57,610
(sighs) Same as with her father.

198
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,930
The funeral's on Thursday.

199
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,598
Um, they'd like you to be a pallbearer, if we can go.

200
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:05,910
That's a thousand mile trip our car won't make it.

201
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,480
Well, Jason just showed up here.

202
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,640
Um, he wants to stay with us.

203
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,733
I could probably get him to lend us his truck.

204
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,523
Hold on.

205
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,760
My grandmother just died in Pocatello, Idaho,

206
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,680
uh, my mother's not doing too well.

207
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,880
I'd love to be with her.

208
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,250
Your shift ends at 7:00 am, solider,

209
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,580
after that take five days leave.

210
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,730
Thanks, Sergeant, I appreciate it.

211
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,220
Uh, yeah, uh, when I get home in the morning let's take off.

212
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:38,220
(birds chirping)
(traffic humming)

213
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:43,318
(horn honking)

214
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:44,923
(car door clicks)

215
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:46,376
Hi, I'll be right down.

216
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:48,767
(car door bangs)

217
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:50,720
(thunder rumbling)

218
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,920
Hey, Jason.

219
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,191
Hey, Jim.
How ya doing?

220
00:08:53,191 --> 00:08:54,024
Not too bad.

221
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:56,260
Sorry about your grandmother.

222
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,113
Yeah, she was a great lady.

223
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,020
Listen, thanks for lending us the truck

224
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,570
and taking care of Pooh.

225
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,020
Oh, it's no problem really.

226
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,103
Hi.
Hi.

227
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,630
Sure you don't wanna change or sleep?

228
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,680
We shouldn't push it.

229
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,153
I'm fine.

230
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,270
I'll change when you drive.

231
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,300
Hey.
(Clayton giggles)

232
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,687
Hi.

233
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:22,270
Did you pack my dress uniform?

234
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,400
Everything.
Good.

235
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,930
I promised Muriel we'd swing by their house

236
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,359
to pick up the dress clothes for the funeral.

237
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:27,520
Okay.
Okay, and I've taken

238
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,510
my drums out and I've put in the mattress

239
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,670
that way you can take turns driving

240
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,170
and sleeping and beat the rain.

241
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,940
And I've got chains just in case there's any snow.

242
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,300
Oh, I forgot the other sleeping bag, I'll just go get it.

243
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,663
Just toss it down, huh?
Yeah.

244
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:42,090
He's so helpful 'cause he moved out of my dad's house.

245
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,609
He wants to move in with us.

246
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:45,542
(thunder rumbling)

247
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,180
We've got no room really.

248
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,660
Oh, well, we have to, he's family.

249
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,430
Jim, I know he's my brother

250
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,550
and I know how hard it can get living with my father,

251
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,725
even so with the baby and your work schedule-

252
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:56,840
We'll manage.

253
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,272
We'll, we'll put him on the couch, okay?

254
00:09:59,272 --> 00:10:00,471
(rain pattering)

255
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:02,480
Ah, more rain, incredible.

256
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,858
Hey, yeah, right here.

257
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:06,370
Play with Pooh a lot, okay?

258
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,722
Got it.
And take in those clothes.

259
00:10:08,722 --> 00:10:09,564
Hey, there's pizza-
Hey!

260
00:10:09,564 --> 00:10:11,088
In the fridge.
Happy New Year!

261
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:13,112
No parties please.

262
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:13,945
Have a good one.

263
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:17,028
(car engine revving)

264
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:21,840
Now the California Drought Center

265
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,670
reports that the before the seven year drought is over

266
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,360
we're going to have to see a lot more of those storms.

267
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,470
And here's one that's on its way, in fact-

268
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,470
No, we're just about to leave your house.

269
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,303
Yeah, we borrowed a truck.

270
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:33,136
It's reliable.

271
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,350
Of course we have chains.

272
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,340
She's my grandmother and I wanna pay my respects.

273
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,920
I know Jimmy, but she'd dead,

274
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,380
and you being here won't bring her back.

275
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,570
They say, "It's a really bad storm."

276
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,950
Mom, we're from Milwaukee, I know how to drive in snow.

277
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,020
If we leave now-
Now!

278
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,210
No, you can't drive through the mountains

279
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,720
in the dark in the snow. (crying)

280
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,560
My God, I don't wanna go to three more funerals.

281
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,753
Let me talk to him.
You.

282
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,480
Jimmy, wait, wait for morning, okay?

283
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,780
Give 'em a chance to clear the roads.

284
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,630
You'll still be here early Wednesday.

285
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,813
Your mom never had a chance to say goodbye,

286
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,040
let's not upset her anymore.

287
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,470
Sure.

288
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,561
All right, bye.

289
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:21,960
The seven year drought is over,

290
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,340
we're going to be seeing a lot more of those storms.

291
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,673
(gentle brooding music)

292
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:31,293
(birds chirping)

293
00:11:31,293 --> 00:11:34,480
So this storm has dropped up to 20 inches of snow

294
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,410
in some areas of the Sierras.

295
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,710
Now as this storm moves off to the east

296
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,790
look what we have right behind it out over the Pacific.

297
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,251
Yet another major winter storm will drench the Bay Area.

298
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:47,470
The CHP Hotline says I-80 will be closed

299
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,750
through the mountains but will reopen

300
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,560
at noon with chains required.

301
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,903
If we leave now we'll be first in line when they open.

302
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:56,261
What?

303
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:57,211
You don't wanna go?

304
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,296
Just wish we could afford to fly.

305
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:01,560
(Jim chuckles)

306
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,540
I know your mom's upset and you wanna be there for her,

307
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,200
I love that about you.

308
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,395
Just Kevin's there and even Muriel says, "Don't come."

309
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,228
And it might be tough on Clay.

310
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,077
Look Clay sleeps whenever the car's moving.

311
00:12:12,077 --> 00:12:14,270
Jen, you and Clay are my family,

312
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,470
there's a problem we turn around.

313
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,930
But Mom's so upset I, I feel like

314
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,280
I need to be there for her.

315
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,260
I'm from Fresno not Milwaukee.

316
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,570
I've never driven in snow.

317
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,410
I don't even drive in the rain.

318
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,223
I'll drive in the snow, okay?

319
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,125
(truck engine roaring)

320
00:12:40,804 --> 00:12:43,398

321
00:12:43,398 --> 00:12:45,981

323
00:12:58,146 --> 00:12:59,492
Oh.

324
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:00,592
Oh.

325
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:02,325

343
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,012

All right, stop right there please.

354
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,770
Sorry, folks, the road over

355
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,280
at Donner Summit's closed until noon tomorrow.

356
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,490
But the hotline said, "It would open at noon today."

357
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,330
There's too much snow.

358
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,620
I'm afraid you'll have to turn back.

359
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,730
Is there another way?

360
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,140
We have to get to Idaho for a funeral.

361
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,240
I really don't know.

362
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,756
(police radio chattering)

363
00:14:56,756 --> 00:14:59,623
(truck engine roaring)

364
00:14:59,623 --> 00:15:01,313
Have a good day.

365
00:15:01,313 --> 00:15:04,030
I got Clay's formula, subs, and sodas for us, and a map.

366
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,440
Now the man inside says, "The I-5 north is clear."

367
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,420
Whether you can then turn east

368
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,413
to get across the mountains nobody knows.

369
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,430
Hey, if the passes are closed

370
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,060
we'll be at least that much closer to Idaho,

371
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,970
but if we stay here until noon tomorrow

372
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,370
then we'll miss the funeral.

373
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,224
Well, what's the worst that could happen?

374
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:25,040
We have to spend a romantic night in the Country Inn

375
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,500
cuddling beside a roaring fire place.

376
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,457
Hmm.

377
00:15:28,457 --> 00:15:31,374
(Clayton giggling)

378
00:15:32,794 --> 00:15:35,920
(upbeat music)

379
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,670
(Clayton cooing)

380
00:16:22,343 --> 00:16:23,176
Okay, S.

381
00:16:24,187 --> 00:16:25,387
Did I say S already?

382
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:26,220
You said S.

383
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,110
T.

384
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,280
T as in Tom.

385
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,113
Yes.

386
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,702
I'd like to buy a vowel, Pat.

387
00:16:30,702 --> 00:16:32,160
One T, okay.

388
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,993
Um.

389
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,349
An A.

390
00:16:35,349 --> 00:16:36,876
No.

391
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:38,469
(tires skidding)
(ominous music)

392
00:16:38,469 --> 00:16:39,302
Jim, Jim.

393
00:16:45,827 --> 00:16:47,103
You okay?
Yeah.

394
00:16:48,581 --> 00:16:49,790
(gentle music)

395
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,393
Okay?

396
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,750
Your chains are a real tight fit,

397
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,180
that's why I had to use the lift.

398
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,070
It should be fine.

399
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,950
Um, we're headed to Pocatello, Idaho.

400
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,640
Do you know if any of these mountain passes are open?

401
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,240
Well, these passes up here are clear.

402
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,710
Stay on 299 through Alturas, then get over to the 140

403
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,343
that joins up with I-80 at Winnemucca.

404
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:18,298
and you're looking pretty good.

405
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:22,470
Okay, wait, wait, 299 to, oh, okay the 140 to I-80.

406
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,390
Yeah.
Great, thanks.

407
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,259
Maybe we should call Mom

408
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:26,650
and let her know we're detoured and running late.

409
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,483
I wouldn't.

410
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:29,430
Remember how upset she got yesterday about us driving

411
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,310
through the mountains at night?

412
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,143
Yeah, that's right.

413
00:17:31,143 --> 00:17:32,590
She'll stay up all night worrying.

414
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,423
Come on, kiddo.

415
00:17:33,423 --> 00:17:35,055
(gentle music)

416
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,722
(tire thudding)

417
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,380
Oh, we just went through Cedar Pass.

418
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,910
Why are we stopped?

419
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,190
It's the last mountain.

420
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,700
Once we're beyond the mountains, I can take off the chains,

421
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,550
make better time.

422
00:18:04,939 --> 00:18:07,622
It's the middle of nowhere.

423
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:08,480
There's someone.

424
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,363
It's not nowhere.

425
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,700
Look without the racket and the bumps

426
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,350
you'll be able to get some sleep.

427
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:20,869
(truck door bangs)

428
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:31,634
So we passed Cedarville almost an hour ago, so let's see.

429
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,170
Hey, we're in Nevada already, all right.

430
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,640
Hey, look only 20 more miles to Highway 140,

431
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,420
that's the road to Winnemucca.

432
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,393
We'll be in Pocatello for breakfast.

433
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:44,948
(gentle music)

434
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:48,529
(ominous music)

435
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:50,326
(truck thudding)

436
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:52,510
Ooh.
What was that?

437
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,711
Some snow drifted on the road.

438
00:18:53,711 --> 00:18:54,628
We're okay.

439
00:18:58,311 --> 00:19:01,350
(gentle brooding music)

440
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,050
We've gone way over a mile of snow, it's not plowed.

441
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,910
This can't be, this can't be,

442
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,060
we're on 299, a major road going to Route 140,

443
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,660
which is a major road.

444
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,730
It'll open up soon.

445
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:15,660
(truck clanging)

446
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,465
Come on, don't stop.

447
00:19:17,465 --> 00:19:18,700
Don't stop.

448
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,533
Stopped.

449
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,384
(truck thuds)

450
00:19:24,384 --> 00:19:27,634
(truck engine roaring)

451
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,066
I can't believe this.

452
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:34,816
(tires skidding)

453
00:19:42,285 --> 00:19:45,362
(tires skidding)

454
00:19:45,362 --> 00:19:48,112
(tires skidding)

455
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,110
This is major road, how can it not be plowed?

456
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,139
God.

457
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:58,618
(truck door clicks)

458
00:19:58,618 --> 00:20:03,618
(truck door bangs)
(ominous music)

459
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:14,850
(foot thuds)

460
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,000
Someone will come by.

461
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:19,240
(foot thudding)

462
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,913
Help us dig out when it's light.

463
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,413
Jim, Jim, Jim, let's wait for morning.

464
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,917
Someone will come by.

465
00:20:33,985 --> 00:20:36,985
(truck door clicks)

466
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:41,929
(truck door bangs)

467
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:44,179
(window blowing)

468
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:47,096
(fingers scraping)

469
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:52,218
Jim.

470
00:20:53,241 --> 00:20:54,320
Jim.

471
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,599
It's cold again.

472
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,230
(Clayton grunting)

473
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,186
Okay, come here.

474
00:20:59,186 --> 00:21:00,551
Come on, honey.

475
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:01,384
Come on.

476
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:07,334
(starter whirring)

477
00:21:09,591 --> 00:21:12,690
(truck engine roaring)

478
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,240
Three quarters a tank of gas.

479
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,690
We'll be warm until someone comes.

480
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:22,820
(hand tapping)

481
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,623
No tracks on the road except mine.

482
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,250
God, how could I let this happen?

483
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,010
How could I be so stupid?

484
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,545
You're not stupid, you're stubborn.

485
00:21:32,545 --> 00:21:33,970
When you set your mind on doing something

486
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,170
you're not easy to stop.

487
00:21:36,158 --> 00:21:38,400
(Clayton grunting)

488
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,747
When we get to Idaho we'll laugh about it.

489
00:21:44,975 --> 00:21:45,949
(gentle brooding music)

490
00:21:45,949 --> 00:21:46,899
Want some formula?

491
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:48,096
(truck door clicks)

492
00:21:48,096 --> 00:21:48,929
Come on.

493
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:53,101
(truck door bangs)

494
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:01,170
Yummy.

495
00:22:02,435 --> 00:22:03,268
Okay.

496
00:22:08,714 --> 00:22:11,773
(Clayton cooing)

497
00:22:11,773 --> 00:22:13,356
Let's try it, okay?

498
00:22:19,844 --> 00:22:22,523
(Jim panting)

499
00:22:22,523 --> 00:22:24,040
Jim.
Down here.

500
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,902
I'll reattach the chains, we can drive out.

501
00:22:25,902 --> 00:22:28,902
(truck door clicks)

502
00:22:31,323 --> 00:22:34,240
(truck door bangs)

503
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:37,044
(handle clicks)

504
00:22:37,044 --> 00:22:39,711
(gate clicking)

505
00:22:42,118 --> 00:22:43,368
Here hold this.

506
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,810
The tires got no traction on the ice

507
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,410
so I can't drive onto the chain.

508
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,120
God.

509
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,673
The chain's too tight to fasten like this.

510
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,050
We're gonna have to jack up the wheel

511
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,112
so we can put the chain underneath the tire.

512
00:23:12,112 --> 00:23:12,945
Okay.

513
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:20,970
There's gotta be jack in here somewhere.

514
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,250
Check over there.

515
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,708
(Jim sighs)

516
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,748
(Jim scoffs)

517
00:23:31,748 --> 00:23:34,782
(truck door clicks)

518
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:36,813
Hi, are you staying warm?

519
00:23:36,813 --> 00:23:39,080
(Clayton cooing)

520
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,980
He's the best solider in the family.

521
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:43,130
(truck door bangs)

522
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,740
Jason, how can drive without a jack?

523
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,573
He doesn't need one.

524
00:23:46,573 --> 00:23:48,970
He's not stupid enough to get stuck like this.

525
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:49,940
Why did I take the chains off?

526
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,870
How I get us stuck out here?

527
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,820
How?
(fist thudding)

528
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,860
Jim, Jim, we both put us here.

529
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,260
You gave me chances to say stop and I never did.

530
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,140
You would have called your mother

531
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,040
if I hadn't said not to.

532
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,270
She and Kevin could tell the police exactly where we are.

533
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,000
Now they won't have a clue.

534
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,333
(gentle brooding music)

535
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,980
Your hands are so cold.

536
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,270
Your feet must be too.

537
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,100
Let's warm up inside, and try again later.

538
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,500
I gotta get us out of here, Jen.

539
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,973
Later when we're not freezing.

540
00:24:25,037 --> 00:24:27,537
(air blowing)

541
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,070
They probably called while we were out last night.

542
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,770
I, I realize it's not that late

543
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,370
but, but they woulda called.

544
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,630
Well, that's the kind of kids they are.

545
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,983
That's why we're concerned.

546
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,810
I, I understand that.

547
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,283
Uh, uh, uh, all, all right.

548
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,650
All right.

549
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,483
Thanks.

550
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,530
According to the Idaho, Nevada,

551
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,550
and California highway patrols

552
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,810
they haven't been in an accident, arrested, or hospitalized.

553
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,250
They're, uh, they're just late.

554
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,480
So they won't even look for them?

555
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,360
Their procedure is to not even take a report

556
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,173
until someone's missing 72 hours.

557
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:16,060
They say, "They get lots of calls like this in bad storms."

558
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,370
Phone and power lines are down.

559
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,760
People pull into rest stops, and motels, or shelters.

560
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,383
Once the highways reopen people show up.

561
00:25:25,562 --> 00:25:28,110
(Muriel sighs)

562
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,319
It's gonna snow for days.

563
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:35,319
(tires skidding)
(wind blowing)

564
00:25:40,762 --> 00:25:43,512
(tires skidding)

565
00:25:44,716 --> 00:25:45,549
(truck door clicks)

566
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:46,643
Okay, take the wheel.

567
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,516
(truck door bangs)

568
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,266
(chain clanging)

569
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,466
Okay, gently.

570
00:25:57,466 --> 00:25:58,299
Okay.

571
00:25:59,137 --> 00:25:59,995
(truck engine roaring)

572
00:25:59,995 --> 00:26:00,886
(Jim grunting)

573
00:26:00,886 --> 00:26:04,055
(tires skidding)

574
00:26:04,055 --> 00:26:04,972
Whoa, whoa!

575
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:07,974
Okay, uh, go in reverse.

576
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,535
Ready?

577
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:11,408
Go!

578
00:26:11,408 --> 00:26:13,618
(truck engine roaring)

579
00:26:13,618 --> 00:26:14,868
Go, go, go, go!

580
00:26:16,664 --> 00:26:17,497
Whoa!

581
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,437
We're making progress.

582
00:26:20,437 --> 00:26:21,854
You okay?
Yeah.

583
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,913
(chain clangs)

584
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:50,314
(Clayton whimpering)
(chain clanging)

585
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,963
Okay, now ready?

586
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,397
Go!

587
00:26:54,397 --> 00:26:57,061
(truck engine roaring)

588
00:26:57,061 --> 00:26:58,048
Go!

589
00:26:58,048 --> 00:26:59,298
Come on.
Go!

590
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,433
Come on.

591
00:27:02,433 --> 00:27:03,765
Go.

592
00:27:03,765 --> 00:27:04,598
Go!

593
00:27:07,864 --> 00:27:09,120
(chain clangs)
(chain whooshing)

594
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,690
Don't stop!
Keep going.

595
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,523
Straighten out!

596
00:27:11,523 --> 00:27:14,726
Turn into the skid!

597
00:27:14,726 --> 00:27:16,834
Turn into the skid!

598
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:19,157
(brooding music)

599
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:21,177
(fist pound)

600
00:27:21,177 --> 00:27:22,323
Jen.
Now we're really stuck.

601
00:27:22,323 --> 00:27:25,120
Jen, it's okay, you, you did your best.

602
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,010
We'll get some sleep tonight.

603
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:26,960
Try again tomorrow.

604
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,210
Well, the sign for 140 was two miles back, right?

605
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:36,270
So we know it's 18 miles ahead and it's a major road.

606
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,930
I could leave at first light tomorrow, walk the 18 miles,

607
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,963
flag down a car or truck and have help back here by dark.

608
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,673
18 miles in snow?

609
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,310
What about the last town we drove through?

610
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,220
Cedarville, it's like 40 miles back.

611
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,440
And that is a long walk.

612
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,163
I, I couldn't get help back here for two days.

613
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,040
Let's wait here together.

614
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,920
Mom and Kevin will worry, they'll search.

615
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,380
Not here.

616
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,483
We're way north.

617
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,070
We might not even have enough food to last

618
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,620
until someone comes to save us.

619
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:20,190
We have fruitcake, coconut cookies, and chips.

620
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,490
We can ration it.

621
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,444
It's Wednesday and that means

622
00:28:22,444 --> 00:28:24,250
it's all you can eat night at Howie's Barbecue.

623
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,610
Steaks, burgers, chicken, ribs,

624
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,732
and Howie's giant salad and surf bar.

625
00:28:27,732 --> 00:28:30,271
All you can eat, so what are you waiting for?

626
00:28:30,271 --> 00:28:32,550
(button thuds)

627
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,250
Maybe Howie delivers.

628
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:38,870
I wish we had a car phone. (laughs)

629
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,802
Hello, Howie.

630
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:40,770
(Jennifer and Jim laughing)

631
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,652
Bring it all.

632
00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:44,031
(Jim and Jennifer laughing)

633
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:47,014
(Clayton whimpering)

634
00:28:47,014 --> 00:28:49,431
(Jim laughs)

635
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,333
How's his formula?

636
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:58,180
One can left.

637
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,110
If you've almost finished weaning him,

638
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,350
can he still get milk?

639
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,290
I don't know.

640
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,190
Might as well try.

641
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,670
Look we both had basic survival in bootcamp.

642
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,840
The rules are don't panic and stay together.

643
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,080
We need to stay together.

644
00:29:16,982 --> 00:29:19,732
(brooding music)

645
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,790
Dear Diary, well, we're still stuck here.

646
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,580
At night while the motor runs for heat

647
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,430
we flash the headlights in Morse code

648
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,113
hoping someone will see our SOS.

649
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,170
Another storm has hit.

650
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,400
When it's not snowing the wind howls.

651
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,613
Walking is impossible.

652
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,360
We hope to hear on the radio about a search for us.

653
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,100
We're sorry we missed Grandma's funeral.

654
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,090
Our thoughts are with her.

655
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,570
We hope no one dwells on us too much on us missing.

656
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,403
We will get out of this.

657
00:29:54,403 --> 00:29:56,317
We're just not sure how yet.

658
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,843
Tonight is New Year's Eve, big celebration.

659
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,260
We toasted with melted snow

660
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,460
and spent the night on the mattress in back.

661
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:07,431
(upbeat music)

662
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,728
No way.

663
00:30:08,728 --> 00:30:11,959
(phone ringing)

664
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:12,840
Watch out, watch out.

665
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,740
Hand me the phone.

666
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:15,940
Happy New Year!

667
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,681
Uh, no, Jim and Jen won't be back 'til Sunday.

668
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:20,514
This is Jason.

669
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:22,042
Jason?

670
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:23,290
Oh, Jennifer's brother.

671
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,863
Steel drums at the wedding.

672
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,160
Jason, this Kevin Mulligan, Jim's stepfather.

673
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,270
Have you heard from Jim or Jennifer?

674
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,470
Uh, no.

675
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,180
Weren't they supposed to be meeting you in Idaho?

676
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,400
They, they never arrived.

677
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,210
They haven't been seen since Tuesday morning.

678
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,980
We're on our way home to get a search started,

679
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,360
but now we're caught in Winnemucca by another storm.

680
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,300
Called there just in case they, they come home

681
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,650
and left a message on the machine.

682
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,810
No.

683
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,100
I can't believe it.

684
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,247
They're just supposed to cruise up I-80.

685
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:49,160
I know, I know.
What is he saying?

686
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,750
Would your parents have heard from them?

687
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,410
No, they're both away for the holidays.

688
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:55,084
Look, do you know anything about the truck they borrowed?

689
00:30:55,084 --> 00:30:55,917
Three!
Yeah, it's mine.

690
00:30:55,917 --> 00:30:58,860
Two, one, Happy New Year!

691
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,511
(horn blowing)
(upbeat music)

692
00:31:00,511 --> 00:31:03,593
(group cheering)

693
00:31:03,593 --> 00:31:08,593
(door clicks)
(wind blowing)

694
00:31:10,507 --> 00:31:13,950
It's a red Dodge Dakota pickup with a camper shell.

695
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:17,010
Here's the year, the license, the ID number.

696
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,360
I need your credit card numbers.

697
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,230
If they've gone for joy ride it may help us to locate them.

698
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,100
Officer, that's not-
What, no.

699
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,070
Hey, hi.

700
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,224
Happy New Year's. (laughs)

701
00:31:26,224 --> 00:31:28,471
(police radio chattering)

702
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:31,230
(chuckles) Uh, can you hang on for a minute?

703
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,063
Yeah, thanks.

704
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,300
Jimmy was trying to get

705
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,470
to my mother's funeral in Pocatello.

706
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,480
Here's his picture, and this is his wife, Jennifer.

707
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,630
We think they tried another route

708
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,140
to Idaho when I-80 closed.

709
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,190
My wife is very upset.

710
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,023
If you knew Jim,

711
00:31:43,023 --> 00:31:45,536
you'd know he'd try anything to be there for his mother.

712
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:46,730
All right.

713
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,563
I need you to sign there.

714
00:31:47,563 --> 00:31:49,350
When will you begin the search?

715
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,920
On New Year's Day with everyone working

716
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,870
a snow emergency all week.

717
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:53,703
Yeah?

718
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,500
Look you're talking about hundreds of square miles

719
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,320
of practically empty terrain that they may be in.

720
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,153
What, what are you saying?

721
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,930
No search, no airplane, no helicopter?

722
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,480
Procedure is I log the report on the computer,

723
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,340
top brass is back on Monday,

724
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,340
and they'll evaluate the situation then.

725
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,520
We had to wait three days to file this,

726
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,353
now you're gonna bury it

727
00:32:15,353 --> 00:32:17,030
until our kids are out there a week?

728
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,030
Sir.

729
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,190
Our kids may be dying!

730
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,023
Kevin.

731
00:32:21,897 --> 00:32:23,213
(police radio chattering)

732
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:24,870
(phone clicks)

733
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,595
Hi, sorry about that.

734
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:30,928
(gentle brooding music)

735
00:32:31,935 --> 00:32:33,518
He's so helpless.

736
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:39,087
What if he doesn't get to see his first birthday?

737
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:46,934
I think my mom was right,

738
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:49,443
you know about being too young and irresponsible.

739
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,430
You said, "You could never bear to hurt a child,"

740
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,310
that's exactly what we're doing.

741
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,664
(Clayton grunts)

742
00:32:58,664 --> 00:33:00,497
Oh, Jen, I'm so sorry.

743
00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:08,925
Okay, listen.

744
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,323
Dear, Diary, May 12, 1990.

745
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:19,930
My senior prom, that supposedly momentous event in my life,

746
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,130
I stayed all of 15 minutes.

747
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,800
Somehow when Jim and I got there

748
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,360
we only wanted to spend time with each other.

749
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,680
We walked all night on Santa Rosarita Beach

750
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,870
talking mostly about our families,

751
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,810
neither of which is exactly "The Brady Bunch".

752
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,070
He said, "This corny quote from "The Godfather" movie

753
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,647
was his philosophy of life."

754
00:33:38,647 --> 00:33:41,180
"A man who does not spend time with his family

755
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,100
can never be a real man."

756
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,303
His Brando is really bad. (laughing)

757
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,750
But what a father he would make.

758
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,750
Is that the way I should think about my best friend?

759
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,377
I wonder if you've never been in love before

760
00:34:00,377 --> 00:34:02,723
how do you know how it feels?

761
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,943
I know how it feels now.

762
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,659
You're a wonderful father.

763
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,510
And we'll get out of this.

764
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,639
You should have never asked me to the prom.

765
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,389
I was afraid you wouldn't ask me.

766
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,203
I would have, eventually.

767
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,960
Can babies walk when they're one?

768
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:37,963
Some can.

769
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,969
Well, on Clay's first birthday if he can

770
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,213
let's take him for a walk on the beach, okay?

771
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:52,723
Okay.

772
00:34:55,487 --> 00:34:56,699
(wind blowing)

773
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,209
(starter buzzing)

774
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:00,876
(ominous music)

775
00:35:04,356 --> 00:35:05,391
(starter buzzing)

776
00:35:05,391 --> 00:35:07,288
(Jim grunting)

777
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:09,790
(engine whirring)

778
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,543
Oh, God, thank, God, heat.

779
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,833
We have heat, Clay.

780
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:22,223
Jen, we can't rely on the truck anymore.

781
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,570
Today may be our only chance to get help.

782
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,420
It's clearing up.

783
00:35:28,972 --> 00:35:31,420
I know I can walk the 18 miles to 140,

784
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,053
and have help back here by dark.

785
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,633
No, we already discussed it.

786
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,740
Clay's got this much formula left.

787
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,290
We are almost out of food, Jen.

788
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,773
We're dying here.

789
00:35:50,486 --> 00:35:51,720
So it's either sit here and die

790
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,763
or else try and save ourselves.

791
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,190
Then we're all going.

792
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,340
I can have help back here by dark.

793
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,420
There's enough gas.

794
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,993
What if you're late, and the truck won't start tonight?

795
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,170
We'll die here without heat.

796
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,573
I can walk 18 miles.

797
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:18,023
When I was outside trying to dig us out

798
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,533
I could feel my feet freezing.

799
00:36:25,848 --> 00:36:28,410
When I walk I could get frostbite,

800
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,640
but you don't have to, you should stay.

801
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,440
There's enough gas to run the engine all night for heat.

802
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,603
A lot can happen to either of us.

803
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:43,463
Whatever happens I want it to happen together.

804
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,683
I wanna go with you.

805
00:36:52,265 --> 00:36:53,098
Okay.

806
00:36:55,816 --> 00:36:59,290
(gentle brooding music)

807
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,923
Saturday, January 2nd.

808
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,580
To our families, if you are reading this we must be dead.

809
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,430
We tried so hard to make it to Idaho.

810
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,110
Obviously we picked the wrong way.

811
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,550
We had chains on but took them off

812
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,880
hoping we would get there sooner

813
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,850
and you wouldn't worry so much.

814
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,130
We didn't call you to tell you where we were.

815
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,073
Again, we thought you'd worry.

816
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,573
And you would have been right.

817
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,140
There's no excuse for us being stranded here,

818
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,393
just our own mistakes.

819
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,180
Maybe we are too young and irresponsible

820
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,330
because we are Clay's parents

821
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,912
and we got him into this mess.

822
00:37:36,912 --> 00:37:39,060
(Clayton cooing)

823
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,610
And he does not deserve to die.

824
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,840
He is a wonderful, innocent child,

825
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,940
who we know will grow up to be a good man.

826
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,500
So God, please, you will not regret it

827
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,253
if you take us and spare him.

828
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,483
We are walking to Route 140.

829
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,090
It seems like the shortest, best way to reach help.

830
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,833
But if you're reading this we didn't make it.

831
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,960
We apologize a thousand times

832
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,010
for all the pain and worry we caused you.

833
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,363
We ask that you please don't grieve for us.

834
00:38:15,152 --> 00:38:16,030
(truck door bangs)

835
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,230
We found true love with each other and Clay,

836
00:38:19,937 --> 00:38:21,100
and how many people are lucky enough

837
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,433
to ever experience that?

838
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,773
Our last request is to Momma Mulligan,

839
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:31,483
please take in Pooh or find a good home for him.

840
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:34,780
And please bury us all together as a family

841
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,750
enclosing in our coffins a hand full of sand

842
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,333
from Santa Rosarita Beach.

843
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:56,866
(gentle dramatic music)

844
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:02,128
(wind blowing)

845
00:39:22,095 --> 00:39:23,000
How ya doing?

846
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,833
Never better.

847
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,491
Is that all we've walked?

848
00:39:31,491 --> 00:39:34,241
(Clayton crying)

849
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,177
He sleeps when we move and cries when we stop.

850
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:42,830
Oh, you got your hands out of the socks I used for mittens.

851
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,364
You're hungry aren't you?

852
00:39:44,364 --> 00:39:47,114
(Clayton crying)

853
00:39:48,943 --> 00:39:49,940
The last of the formula,

854
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,193
might as well use it before it freezes.

855
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:00,273
We left an hour ago, we've gotta pick up the pace.

856
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,970
How are your feet?

857
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,767
Cold, tingling.

858
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:06,740
You?

859
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,050
Same.

860
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,426
Clay, honey, sorry to rush you but we gotta go.

861
00:40:10,426 --> 00:40:13,759
(gentle brooding music)

862
00:40:50,755 --> 00:40:53,338
(Jim grunting)

863
00:41:08,137 --> 00:41:10,887
(dramatic music)

864
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:26,437
Hello, anybody home?

865
00:41:26,437 --> 00:41:27,900
I'm on hold again.

866
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,420
Coffee?
Please.

867
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,020
I sliced the hotdogs your way.

868
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,713
Precisely down the middle.

869
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,230
Megan, you always go to Terri's to eat her hotdogs.

870
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,690
Please eat.

871
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:40,523
You're not.

872
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,209
(door bell ringing)

873
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:43,810
I know, sweetheart but I want you to.

874
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,280
Stay put, Muriel, this is what I'm here for.

875
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,630
(dog barking)

876
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,480
Okay, I'll tell you what,

877
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,180
you have piece, I'll have a piece.

878
00:41:51,817 --> 00:41:54,469
(dog barks)

879
00:41:54,469 --> 00:41:56,210
Pooh pig, Pooh.

880
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,210
Pooh.
Hi, I'm Jason.

881
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,610
I thought I'd see if I could help.

882
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,160
Yes.
Yes, it is in the computer.

883
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,190
I know it's in your computer,

884
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,530
but the computer can't fly in the air to look for them.

885
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,990
Sir, we'll call you at this number when-

886
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:05,823
Yes.
As soon as we-

887
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:06,694
I'll be here.

888
00:42:06,694 --> 00:42:07,827
Thank you.
Thank you.

889
00:42:07,827 --> 00:42:09,210
(phone thuds)

890
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,510
Still no search.

891
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,570
He says, "They'll see, procedure."

892
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,483
Here's their procedure watch football.

893
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,043
Sports, the opiate of the masses.

894
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,780
Oh, yeah, that's your thing.

895
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,692
I'm, I'm sorry.

896
00:42:25,692 --> 00:42:27,444
(Kevin sighs)

897
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:28,640
As you can see we don't quite know

898
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,100
what we're doing here yet.

899
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,963
We need to light a really big bonfire under someone.

900
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,441
Maybe if I knew some cops.

901
00:42:35,441 --> 00:42:36,930
(dog groaning)

902
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:37,930
Oh, for the love of.

903
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,440
Where's my head been?

904
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,393
Sports.

905
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,670
Promotion, I can light a fire under anyone,

906
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:48,800
radio, TV, newspapers.

907
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,150
Damn if it wasn't a holiday weekend

908
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,673
we could, we'd rent a studio and do a video.

909
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,720
I could do a video right here.

910
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,780
I did the wedding.

911
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,373
Remember after the drum solo?

912
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,270
This one?
No.

913
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,445
No?
Well, it's possible,

914
00:43:04,445 --> 00:43:07,500
but I know we've got better than that.

915
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,940
The wedding picture.

916
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,733
How about something in street clothes?

917
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,217
Oh, there's one.

918
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:14,473
That, that's possible.

919
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,700
Bingo.

920
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,700
We can use the baby.

921
00:43:20,884 --> 00:43:21,717
(gentle music)

922
00:43:21,717 --> 00:43:23,043
Baby lost in blizzard.

923
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,210
The kid's got the headline.

924
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,950
The press will go nuts.

925
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,692
Got another VCR?

926
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:31,302
And patch two of them together and we can edit.

927
00:43:31,302 --> 00:43:32,135
In the other room.

928
00:43:32,135 --> 00:43:35,610
We can up link your video from a TV station to a satellite

929
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:36,940
and beam it all over the west.

930
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,153
We are in business.

931
00:43:38,153 --> 00:43:40,570
You got a computer?

932
00:43:45,548 --> 00:43:46,381
Hold on.

933
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:48,965
Just hold on.

934
00:43:48,965 --> 00:43:52,150
(gentle brooding music)
(wind blowing)

935
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,363
Jen, there's a sign.

936
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,430
How's Clay?

937
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:37,280
Still sleeping.

938
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:43,040
So which way?

939
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,920
I don't know.

940
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,523
This map doesn't show a Hell's Creek or a fork in the road.

941
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,603
Okay, we've been walking 10 hours, we must be almost there.

942
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:56,563
To the left there's nothing for two miles at least.

943
00:44:58,089 --> 00:44:59,903
To the right it could be just over that hill.

944
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,350
Sign says, Hell's Creek to the right,

945
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:07,530
and there's no sign for 140,

946
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,203
maybe 140's not to the right, maybe it's left.

947
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:16,410
Look all I know is I can't go much farther

948
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:19,060
if we choose the wrong fork and don't reach 140 soon.

949
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:25,870
Let's do this we each go down a fork and dig to the surface.

950
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:26,840
Maybe one's just dirt

951
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,140
and then we'll know the other's the main road.

952
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,758
Good idea.

953
00:45:30,758 --> 00:45:34,091
(gentle brooding music)

954
00:45:40,681 --> 00:45:43,431
(snow crunching)

955
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:49,210
This way's dirt.

956
00:45:50,757 --> 00:45:51,590
Gravel.

957
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:52,423
Lots of gravel.

958
00:45:53,272 --> 00:45:54,444
(Clayton crying)

959
00:45:54,444 --> 00:45:55,616
Clay.

960
00:45:55,616 --> 00:45:58,366
(Clayton crying)

961
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,990
Jen, there's no time.

962
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,937
But he's hungry.

963
00:46:16,082 --> 00:46:17,320
Clay.

964
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,153
Oh, his mittens.

965
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:20,230
Clay, Clay, please keep your mittens on.

966
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:21,720
His hands are so cold.

967
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,553
It'll be worse for him

968
00:46:22,553 --> 00:46:24,100
if we get stuck out here in the dark.

969
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,650
If we go now he'll fall asleep.

970
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,103
I don't think he's getting any milk from me anyway.

971
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:32,470
Jen, we've got to pick a fork now.

972
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,423
A gravel road's better than dirt, isn't it?

973
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,163
So gravel must be the main road to 140.

974
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,818
Sounds good.

975
00:46:52,818 --> 00:46:56,151
(gentle brooding music)

976
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:07,400
It's Kevin Mulligan.

977
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, way too long.

978
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,540
Listen, I'm sorry to bother you at home.

979
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,050
I know I'm tearing you away from the game

980
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,720
but I need a favor.

981
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,910
I'm faxing something to your news department.

982
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:16,880
We're also buying satellite time,

983
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,223
and want your station to take our feed.

984
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,440
No, no, no, it's not promotion.

985
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,240
It's my kids, they're missing in the snow since Tuesday.

986
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:28,160
We're all locked onto the satellite.

987
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,160
Transmitting in five, four, three, two, one.

988
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,300
US Army Private James Stolpa, his wife, Jennifer,

989
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,660
and their infant son, Clayton

990
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,700
have been missing since Tuesday December 29th.

991
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,470
They were last seen leaving Castro Valley, California

992
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:51,360
driving a red 1988 Dodge Dakota pickup truck

993
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,470
with a black camper shell.

994
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:56,860
Their destination was Pocatello, Idaho.

995
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:00,760
If anybody has seen any of these people or this truck,

996
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:05,673
please call the Stolpa Rescue Hotline at 1-510-555-4341.

997
00:48:08,865 --> 00:48:10,610
(gentle brooding music)

998
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:12,206
Just to the top of hill, Jen.

999
00:48:12,206 --> 00:48:14,400
It's probably right over this hill.

1000
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,840
Stop.

1001
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,980
We can't.

1002
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:17,980
We gotta keep going.

1003
00:48:19,738 --> 00:48:21,288
I have to, please.

1004
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,810
Shouldn't we be there by now?

1005
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,911
Maybe we took the wrong way.

1006
00:48:26,911 --> 00:48:28,411
We didn't.

1007
00:48:30,856 --> 00:48:31,689
Stars.

1008
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:36,510
Shooting stars, do you see them?

1009
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:38,560
Yeah, yeah.

1010
00:48:41,844 --> 00:48:42,844
Maybe it's a sign.

1011
00:48:44,249 --> 00:48:45,999
Go, please let it be a sign for us.

1012
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:48,690
Do you see that?

1013
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:49,523
Lights.

1014
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,733
It's 140.

1015
00:48:52,733 --> 00:48:54,110
It's gotta be 140.

1016
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:56,180
We gotta get there, Jen.

1017
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,000
If we rest we might not wake up.

1018
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,310
Now before Clay cries, we can do it.

1019
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:02,283
It is a sign.

1020
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:04,923
He's watching over us.

1021
00:49:06,995 --> 00:49:10,162
(gentle upbeat music)

1022
00:49:33,339 --> 00:49:35,839
(Jim panting)

1023
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:38,663
Last hill.

1024
00:49:42,577 --> 00:49:47,501
Oh.

1025
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:49,933
(both groan)

1026
00:49:49,933 --> 00:49:52,766
(Jennifer groans)

1027
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:55,813
No more hills.

1028
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:58,203
We made it.

1029
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:01,853
I hurt so bad.

1030
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:04,010
It's right down there.

1031
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:09,484
I gotta check Clay.

1032
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,650
I don't hear him.

1033
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:15,610
Did he cry last night?

1034
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:18,470
No.

1035
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:19,303
We were moving.

1036
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,900
But he hasn't eaten since,

1037
00:50:28,365 --> 00:50:30,900
(ominous music)

1038
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,223
and we're not moving now.

1039
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,120
Why isn't he crying?

1040
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,870
He hasn't eaten, he must be hungry.

1041
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:43,570
He always cries when we stop moving.

1042
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:47,573
He's sleeping.

1043
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:54,581
What if he's not?

1044
00:50:54,581 --> 00:50:58,643
What if, what if we made it and he didn't?

1045
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:03,503
Will you look?

1046
00:51:05,216 --> 00:51:08,322
Will you look?

1047
00:51:08,322 --> 00:51:09,274
Yeah.

1048
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,127
Wait, no, not here.

1049
00:51:10,127 --> 00:51:11,356
No, I can't see.

1050
00:51:11,356 --> 00:51:12,606
Please, please.

1051
00:51:15,569 --> 00:51:16,402
Please.

1052
00:51:19,834 --> 00:51:21,884
(Clayton crying)
(gentle music)

1053
00:51:21,884 --> 00:51:22,717
Clay.

1054
00:51:22,717 --> 00:51:25,402
Oh, my God, Clay, Clay.

1055
00:51:25,402 --> 00:51:26,235
Clay.

1056
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,857
Clay, I love you.

1057
00:51:32,595 --> 00:51:34,753
Hi, Mommy's gonna feed you.

1058
00:51:34,753 --> 00:51:37,503
(Clayton crying)

1059
00:51:41,026 --> 00:51:44,242
And we're all going down there.

1060
00:51:44,242 --> 00:51:45,225
Hi.

1061
00:51:45,225 --> 00:51:47,263
And I'm gonna get you a real bottle.

1062
00:51:47,263 --> 00:51:48,180
Yeah, yeah.

1063
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,464
I'm sorry, honey.

1064
00:51:51,464 --> 00:51:52,297
Shh, shh.

1065
00:51:52,297 --> 00:51:53,770
We're almost there, it's okay.

1066
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:54,603
Jen.

1067
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,433
Jen, come here.

1068
00:51:57,392 --> 00:51:59,792
(Clayton crying)

1069
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:00,781
Oh, it's okay.

1070
00:52:00,781 --> 00:52:03,531
(Clayton crying)

1071
00:52:05,044 --> 00:52:07,549
There's no road.

1072
00:52:07,549 --> 00:52:08,637
Nothing.

1073
00:52:08,637 --> 00:52:11,260
(dramatic music)

1074
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,410
We took the wrong fork.

1075
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:16,924
We're lost.

1076
00:52:24,075 --> 00:52:28,610
(wind blowing)
(brooding music)

1077
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,200
It's so beautiful.

1078
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,550
How can it be so beautiful?

1079
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:33,610
What was that light we saw?

1080
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:34,443
Where is it?

1081
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:35,276
I don't know.

1082
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:38,280
We have to go back.

1083
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:44,193
The stars and lights were a sign.

1084
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,170
He gave us a sign.

1085
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,750
Jen.
How could he send

1086
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,400
us the wrong way?

1087
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,640
How could he?

1088
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,110
Our baby is dying.

1089
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:54,630
Jen, stop it.

1090
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:57,310
Look, it is not up to God, or Kevin,

1091
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:59,010
or the police to rescue us,

1092
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:00,633
we have to rescue ourselves.

1093
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:04,570
We cannot panic, we've got to keep our wits.

1094
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:07,253
If we do then no one is going to die, okay?

1095
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:09,920
Jen, Jen, look at me.

1096
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,043
Look at me, okay?

1097
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,420
This is what being a mother and father is all about.

1098
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,470
We brought our son into this world

1099
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,200
and his life is in our hands.

1100
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,163
Nobody owes us.

1101
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,593
And we can save him together.

1102
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:25,693
We can.

1103
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,703
I just wanna quit.

1104
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:30,370
I know I'll die but I don't care.

1105
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:31,203
I care.

1106
00:53:36,245 --> 00:53:38,995
(Clayton crying)

1107
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:46,090
Imagine me being in the army defending the USA.

1108
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:48,630
You took point most of the night.

1109
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,123
Follow you anywhere, solider.

1110
00:53:51,256 --> 00:53:52,443
(Jennifer yells)
(suspenseful music)

1111
00:53:52,443 --> 00:53:54,905
Jen!

1112
00:53:54,905 --> 00:53:56,050
Jen.

1113
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:56,883
Jen.

1114
00:53:56,883 --> 00:53:57,896
Clay's okay.
You okay?

1115
00:53:57,896 --> 00:53:58,729
Clay's okay.

1116
00:53:58,729 --> 00:53:59,963
He's okay.
Shh, shh.

1117
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:02,204
You okay?

1118
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,201
Here, come on.

1119
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,809
(groans) I want to.

1120
00:54:07,809 --> 00:54:08,642
Come on.

1121
00:54:10,127 --> 00:54:11,463
But my feet won't go.

1122
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:16,670
Okay, we'll, we'll stop and rest.

1123
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:17,620
We'll find a place.

1124
00:54:25,244 --> 00:54:27,911
(Clayton cries)

1125
00:54:49,523 --> 00:54:50,579
Wait here.

1126
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:52,640
I think I see a place, I'll check it out.

1127
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,540
You okay?

1128
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,373
Yeah.

1129
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,140
Jim is in excellent shape.

1130
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:19,973
He's a solider.

1131
00:55:19,973 --> 00:55:21,860
And Jennifer was a solider until last year.

1132
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,170
We have every reason to believe they're still alive.

1133
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:27,010
What are the police and highway patrol

1134
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:28,670
doing to find your kids?
Yeah.

1135
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:29,503
Nothing.

1136
00:55:30,555 --> 00:55:31,863
You can't mean nothing.

1137
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,050
They have entered a missing persons report

1138
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:39,180
on to their computer system.

1139
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,330
In my opinion considering

1140
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:42,193
the resources they have it's nothing.

1141
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:46,100
Look, uh, can we go off the record a second

1142
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,850
so I can be straight with you?

1143
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,037
Sure.
Sure.

1144
00:55:49,037 --> 00:55:50,868
Cut video on it.

1145
00:55:50,868 --> 00:55:51,970
I'm cutting camera.

1146
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:52,930
We're talking about hundreds

1147
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:54,643
of square miles in the mountains.

1148
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:57,713
It's going on six days.

1149
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,650
We all know these kids can't last much longer.

1150
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,650
And for the love of.

1151
00:56:04,792 --> 00:56:07,375
(gentle music)

1152
00:56:12,775 --> 00:56:15,275
I cannot get anyone to search.

1153
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:21,350
Somebody hears this maybe we'll get some action.

1154
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:22,990
Well, they're hear it.

1155
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:26,010
Uh, Mr. Mulligan, if officials aren't helping

1156
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:27,020
in the search for your kids

1157
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,440
perhaps the millions of people in our viewing area can.

1158
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,333
What can average citizens listening out there do?

1159
00:56:33,471 --> 00:56:36,054
(wind blowing)

1160
00:56:37,556 --> 00:56:40,550
(Jennifer grunting)

1161
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:41,633
Here.

1162
00:56:50,172 --> 00:56:51,505
Hi.

1163
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:57,931
I'll covering the opening with the garment bag.

1164
00:56:57,931 --> 00:57:00,831
(Clayton crying)

1165
00:57:00,831 --> 00:57:02,498
I know.

1166
00:57:07,533 --> 00:57:09,670
Did you see a license number?

1167
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:11,510
No, but the color was red.

1168
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:12,620
Did you see any people?

1169
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:14,340
Was anybody there?

1170
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,412
And where exactly was the truck?

1171
00:57:16,412 --> 00:57:19,329
(group chattering)

1172
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,470
Somebody saw the truck.

1173
00:57:23,416 --> 00:57:24,398
(wind blowing)

1174
00:57:24,398 --> 00:57:25,484
(lighter clicks)

1175
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:26,317
Come on.

1176
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:30,570
This will light it.

1177
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:31,403
Clay needs it.

1178
00:57:31,403 --> 00:57:33,090
He's had the same diaper on for two days

1179
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:34,290
and that's the last one.

1180
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:44,680
That's my life.

1181
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,500
Jen, if we can't start a fire

1182
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,743
there's not gonna be a lot more to write about.

1183
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:57,020
We can finish these and light the bag.

1184
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,990
(Clayton crying)

1185
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:00,823
Dump it out.

1186
00:58:04,296 --> 00:58:07,616
(paper tearing)

1187
00:58:07,616 --> 00:58:10,366
(lighter clicks)

1188
00:58:18,565 --> 00:58:21,090
All there is is this lousy brush.

1189
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:22,567
I've gotta get more.

1190
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:23,747
Jim.

1191
00:58:23,747 --> 00:58:25,434
What?
(gentle brooding music)

1192
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:26,267
Rest.

1193
00:58:49,062 --> 00:58:51,479
(Jim grunts)

1194
00:59:02,012 --> 00:59:02,845
Jen.

1195
00:59:04,931 --> 00:59:05,764
Hi.

1196
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,257
It's clear.

1197
00:59:10,086 --> 00:59:10,919
You okay?

1198
00:59:12,347 --> 00:59:13,180
Mm-hmm.

1199
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:15,855
So what do we got here?

1200
00:59:15,855 --> 00:59:18,570
A red Dodge pickup stranded in snow on Route 6

1201
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:20,623
approximately 10 miles north of Bishop.

1202
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:23,023
Bishop, Bishop's way south of Reno.

1203
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,320
That doesn't make sense.

1204
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,610
To go south to then go north to Idaho.

1205
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:30,580
Jim would drive to Idaho by way of Mexico if he had to.

1206
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:31,600
I'll call CHP.

1207
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,989
Steve call the local sheriff down there and check on this.

1208
00:59:33,989 --> 00:59:35,490
You got it.

1209
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:36,887
Here take him.

1210
00:59:36,887 --> 00:59:41,887
I got him.
Okay.

1211
00:59:54,231 --> 00:59:55,326
(Jennifer groans)

1212
00:59:55,326 --> 00:59:56,159
You okay?

1213
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:57,233
Jen?
I'm trying.

1214
00:59:58,649 --> 00:59:59,482
(Clayton crying)

1215
00:59:59,482 --> 01:00:00,315
Can you stand?

1216
01:00:03,782 --> 01:00:05,115
Okay.
Help me.

1217
01:00:06,045 --> 01:00:06,878
Come on.

1218
01:00:08,028 --> 01:00:09,443
(Clayton crying)
(Jennifer groaning)

1219
01:00:09,443 --> 01:00:11,751
Here, here, we'll sit, we'll sit.

1220
01:00:11,751 --> 01:00:12,584
We'll sit.

1221
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:27,403
I need more time.

1222
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:31,050
I'm trying.

1223
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:32,010
I know you are.

1224
01:00:34,257 --> 01:00:36,840
(gentle music)

1225
01:00:40,908 --> 01:00:44,533
Jen, I, I feel strong.

1226
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:48,353
I think I should go and bring back help.

1227
01:00:50,351 --> 01:00:52,720
I think we're too lost to ever find 140.

1228
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,990
The closest help we can be certain of

1229
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:56,253
is all the way back in Cedarville.

1230
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:58,470
I could follow our tracks back to the truck tonight.

1231
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:59,420
By tomorrow night I can,

1232
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,050
I can do the 40 miles to Cedarville.

1233
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:03,000
I can have help back here by Wednesday.

1234
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,920
And if we rest another day, just one more day,

1235
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,110
I'll be better, I swear.

1236
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:09,083
What if you're not?

1237
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:12,798
We don't have any time left.

1238
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:15,223
You promised you wouldn't leave me.

1239
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,007
If you want me to stay I'll stay.

1240
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,883
But if I leave for these three days I think we will live.

1241
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:33,307
If I stay I think we'll die.

1242
01:01:39,683 --> 01:01:40,516
It's okay.

1243
01:01:41,788 --> 01:01:44,942
(Jennifer whimpering)

1244
01:01:44,942 --> 01:01:46,944
I know there's not much food

1245
01:01:46,944 --> 01:01:47,777
but you should keep it.

1246
01:01:47,777 --> 01:01:48,990
You gotta keep strong for Clay.

1247
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:50,611
I'm not doing him any good.

1248
01:01:50,611 --> 01:01:53,970
Yes, you are, don't say that.

1249
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:56,465
He slept so much last night.

1250
01:01:56,465 --> 01:01:57,298
Shh.

1251
01:02:00,323 --> 01:02:01,790
Look you have got to keep yourself

1252
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:04,350
and him alive until Wednesday.

1253
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:05,193
You can do it.

1254
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,014
Knowing that is what will keep me going, okay?

1255
01:02:10,014 --> 01:02:12,847
(Jennifer crying)

1256
01:02:16,846 --> 01:02:18,263
Come on, come on.

1257
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:20,066
It's okay.

1258
01:02:24,192 --> 01:02:25,025
Shh.

1259
01:02:32,843 --> 01:02:34,153
It's your birthday today.

1260
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,473
Five months old.

1261
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:41,393
Some party, huh? (laughs)

1262
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,520
I promise when I come back on Wednesday

1263
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,173
I'll bring a bottle for you, a humongous bottle.

1264
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:54,073
You're gonna be the man around here for a while,

1265
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:56,883
so just hold on.

1266
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:00,943
And take care of your mom, okay?

1267
01:03:13,628 --> 01:03:18,628
(wind blowing)
(footsteps crunching)

1268
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:36,090
I'll leave this shirt as a marker for when I come back.

1269
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:37,030
Wednesday!

1270
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:37,863
Two days!

1271
01:03:37,863 --> 01:03:38,696
I'll be here.

1272
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,073
Jimmy,

1273
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:50,880
Clay and are gonna make it.

1274
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,333
I love you, Jimmy.

1275
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,753
I love you too, Jen.

1276
01:03:59,264 --> 01:04:00,713
(gentle music)

1277
01:04:00,713 --> 01:04:02,800
(Jennifer crying)

1278
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,727
He said it, Clay, out loud.

1279
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:08,253
Hey, Jen!

1280
01:04:09,619 --> 01:04:10,690
On Clay's first birthday

1281
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:13,397
we're still going for that walk on the beach, right?

1282
01:04:13,397 --> 01:04:14,230
Yes.

1283
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:22,792
Yes.

1284
01:04:25,014 --> 01:04:26,014
Yes, we are.

1285
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,759
(car door clicks)
(police radio chattering)

1286
01:04:34,759 --> 01:04:36,393
(man chattering)

1287
01:04:36,393 --> 01:04:38,196
(car door bangs)

1288
01:04:38,196 --> 01:04:39,860
Bringing fresh battery pack.

1289
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:41,351
I'll try and get, uh, some footage

1290
01:04:41,351 --> 01:04:43,529
of the sheriff while he's coming in.

1291
01:04:43,529 --> 01:04:45,510
We've had calls from Auburn, Downieville,

1292
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:47,250
even as far south as Bishop.

1293
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,400
Okay.
People have seen either them

1294
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,870
or the truck.

1295
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:52,570
We called the local sheriff's but not one has checked out.

1296
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:53,980
Keep tracking those leads.

1297
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:55,210
We need all the help we can get.

1298
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:56,950
Lieutenant, we know these kids.

1299
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:58,320
We know they're alive out there,

1300
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,620
and they need all the help they can get

1301
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:01,279
from people with helicopters and aircraft.

1302
01:05:01,279 --> 01:05:02,540
Mr. Mulligan, I pledge to you

1303
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:03,840
we're going all out on this now,

1304
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,860
but seven days is a long time to be stuck in the snow.

1305
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,140
So why are you just starting to look?

1306
01:05:08,463 --> 01:05:11,585
(gentle brooding music)

1307
01:05:11,585 --> 01:05:14,954
(group chattering)

1308
01:05:14,954 --> 01:05:17,295
That's my smart girl.

1309
01:05:17,295 --> 01:05:22,295
(wind blowing)
(brooding music)

1310
01:05:30,846 --> 01:05:32,100
(metal thudding)
(birds chirping)

1311
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:33,370
Are you starting to search yourself

1312
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:35,590
because you thing CHP is just going through the motions?

1313
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,390
CHP is doing a fine job now

1314
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:38,810
but they need all the help anybody can give.

1315
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:40,650
There's hundreds of square miles of mountains,

1316
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:41,680
where are you gonna search?

1317
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,410
Or are you just creating a photo op?

1318
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:44,960
We'll put up posters everywhere,

1319
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,000
talk to people who might have seen him.

1320
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,590
Look, I'll use the phone,

1321
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:50,040
I'll use this truck my buddy lent me,

1322
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:53,000
I'll use anything I can to help find my kids.

1323
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,073
That includes using you.

1324
01:05:54,073 --> 01:05:55,316
Is there something wrong with that?

1325
01:05:55,316 --> 01:05:56,881
(brooding music)
(wind blowing)

1326
01:05:56,881 --> 01:05:59,631
(snow crunching)

1327
01:06:09,001 --> 01:06:12,001
(Jennifer groaning)

1328
01:06:26,053 --> 01:06:28,886
(Jennifer crying)

1329
01:06:35,466 --> 01:06:37,006
(Jennifer crying)

1330
01:06:37,006 --> 01:06:37,839
God.

1331
01:06:39,937 --> 01:06:40,770
No!

1332
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:45,060
(Clayton crying)

1333
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,038
Okay, they've thawed.

1334
01:06:51,038 --> 01:06:53,788
(Clayton crying)

1335
01:06:54,714 --> 01:06:56,180
Frostbite, they've thawed.

1336
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,224
(dramatic music)

1337
01:06:58,224 --> 01:06:59,057
Clay.

1338
01:07:00,274 --> 01:07:03,523
Clay, Mom will be right there, Clay.

1339
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:07,740
Okay.

1340
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:11,807
They'll freeze. (voice echoing)

1341
01:07:11,807 --> 01:07:14,557
(brooding music)

1342
01:07:26,053 --> 01:07:28,790
(gentle brooding music)

1343
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:32,033
Mom's trying not to hurt you, okay?

1344
01:07:33,529 --> 01:07:34,840
She's just trying to feed you

1345
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:39,840
like she's a mom bird and you're a baby bird, okay?

1346
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,010
Take the water, Clay, please.

1347
01:07:49,862 --> 01:07:52,136
(Clayton grunts)

1348
01:07:52,136 --> 01:07:54,486
(water dripping)

1349
01:07:54,486 --> 01:07:55,800
(brooding music)

1350
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,794
(wind howling)

1351
01:07:58,794 --> 01:08:01,294
(Jim panting)

1352
01:08:08,264 --> 01:08:09,487
(body thuds)

1353
01:08:09,487 --> 01:08:12,070
(Jim grunting)

1354
01:08:22,853 --> 01:08:26,020
(footsteps crunching)

1355
01:08:28,322 --> 01:08:31,014
(truck door clicks)

1356
01:08:31,014 --> 01:08:36,014
(truck door bangs)
(Jim shivering)

1357
01:08:41,977 --> 01:08:42,809
(key clicks)

1358
01:08:42,809 --> 01:08:45,527
All right, come on, heat.

1359
01:08:45,527 --> 01:08:47,533
(starter whirring)

1360
01:08:47,533 --> 01:08:50,116
(Jim grunting)

1361
01:08:54,341 --> 01:08:55,174
Come on.

1362
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,729
Jim, it's Tuesday now.

1363
01:08:58,729 --> 01:08:59,930
The sun will be up soon.

1364
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:03,200
We've almost made it half way until you come back.

1365
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,120
(coyote howling)

1366
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,160
I worry about falling asleep.

1367
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:09,819
Maybe some animal will come in or maybe I won't wake up.

1368
01:09:09,819 --> 01:09:12,059
So I flick on the flashlight.

1369
01:09:12,059 --> 01:09:13,783
The coyotes sound so close.

1370
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,940
I'd like to keep Clay awake too

1371
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:19,403
just to be sure he's okay, but he's so tired.

1372
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:23,809
I'm sure Kevin and Muriel are searching by now.

1373
01:09:23,809 --> 01:09:25,853
But I know there's not much time left.

1374
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:28,702
I'm scared.

1375
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:34,053
It hurts so bad, not my feet, they're frozen again.

1376
01:09:35,059 --> 01:09:36,410
It's seeing Clay like this.

1377
01:09:41,178 --> 01:09:46,178
♪ Only the stars can see forever ♪

1378
01:09:47,874 --> 01:09:50,406
♪ And I can see them smile ♪

1379
01:09:50,406 --> 01:09:51,813
(coyote howling)

1380
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:55,670
♪ When we're together ♪

1381
01:09:55,670 --> 01:10:00,670
♪ Though someone else may swear their love is true ♪

1382
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:07,242
(gentle music)

1383
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:34,026
(brooding music)

1384
01:10:34,026 --> 01:10:36,033
(fire crackling)

1385
01:10:36,033 --> 01:10:37,680
They're on TV.
Shh.

1386
01:10:39,003 --> 01:10:42,470
I see these kids about a week ago, uh, buying map,

1387
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:45,120
asking about an alternate route across the mountains.

1388
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:47,464
Yeah.
Thanks.

1389
01:10:47,464 --> 01:10:48,297
Listen, if you have no objection,

1390
01:10:48,297 --> 01:10:49,280
I'd like to leave a flyer here.

1391
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,212
Sure.
Thanks a lot.

1392
01:10:51,212 --> 01:10:52,379
Appreciate it.

1393
01:10:53,437 --> 01:10:55,000
They've been missing since last Tuesday.

1394
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,465
Could you show this to friends, relatives,

1395
01:10:56,465 --> 01:10:58,610
anyone who might have seen 'em?

1396
01:10:58,610 --> 01:11:00,900
Another gas station, another diner,

1397
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:02,660
another convenience store.

1398
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,650
Anything to find their loved ones who have been missing

1399
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:06,075
since last Tuesday.
Thank goodness.

1400
01:11:06,075 --> 01:11:07,405
If you have nay information-
Did they say

1401
01:11:07,405 --> 01:11:09,309
the phone number?
On the missing Stolpa family

1402
01:11:09,309 --> 01:11:14,309
please contact the Stolpa Hotline at 510-555-4341.

1403
01:11:14,999 --> 01:11:18,001
(phone ringing)

1404
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:18,845
(group chattering)

1405
01:11:18,845 --> 01:11:21,077
Mommy, I want to see.

1406
01:11:21,077 --> 01:11:22,077
It was over, Megan.

1407
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:24,070
Someone must have seen something.

1408
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:26,843
We'll, we'll get a call.
Muriel, it's Kevin.

1409
01:11:26,843 --> 01:11:27,834
(car door clicks)

1410
01:11:27,834 --> 01:11:29,130
(birds chirping)

1411
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:30,420
Hi.
Hi.

1412
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,840
Anything?

1413
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,350
No.

1414
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:36,393
They ran Joe Tirado's report again on the noon news.

1415
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,680
I don't know suddenly it seems so-

1416
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,660
We know they're strong.

1417
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:41,563
What about CHP?

1418
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:44,000
Searching.

1419
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,712
They say, "There's a big storm coming

1420
01:11:45,712 --> 01:11:47,740
and they won't be able to fly much longer."

1421
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:51,063
Muriel, I don't have anything new to feed the press today.

1422
01:11:52,191 --> 01:11:57,191
(brooding music)
(Jim panting)

1423
01:11:57,330 --> 01:12:00,090
Is this the first aid class? (voice echoing)

1424
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,559
You are? (voice echoing)

1425
01:12:01,559 --> 01:12:04,850
'Cause, um, I'm new here too. (voice echoing)

1426
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:05,820
Jennifer.

1427
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,440
Hi.

1428
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,544
You're not mad I wanted to leave the prom are you?

1429
01:12:09,544 --> 01:12:12,044
I don't know I just, I just like walking with you.

1430
01:12:17,263 --> 01:12:19,680
(body thuds)

1431
01:12:21,626 --> 01:12:24,690
To have and to hold from this day forward,

1432
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:27,743
in sickness and health, to love and to cherish,

1433
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,201
till death do us part.

1434
01:12:31,201 --> 01:12:35,160
(laughs) Oh, my God, he looks just like you.

1435
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,063
He's so beautiful.

1436
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,550
But Kevin's there and even Muriel says, "Don't come."

1437
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:43,850
It might be tough on Clay.

1438
01:12:47,076 --> 01:12:49,743
(ominous music)

1439
01:12:52,295 --> 01:12:55,045
(coyote howling)

1440
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,113
Stay away.

1441
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:00,180
Shut up!

1442
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,013
Stay away!

1443
01:13:03,482 --> 01:13:05,907
Jen.

1444
01:13:05,907 --> 01:13:07,147
Jen.

1445
01:13:07,147 --> 01:13:07,980
No.

1446
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,850
You're alive, Jen.

1447
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:12,255
Clay.

1448
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:14,172
Jen, Jen, you're alive.

1449
01:13:15,539 --> 01:13:16,372
Jen!

1450
01:13:17,879 --> 01:13:19,164
(brooding music)
(wind blowing)

1451
01:13:19,164 --> 01:13:21,664
(Jim panting)

1452
01:14:06,265 --> 01:14:07,098
Hey!

1453
01:14:09,848 --> 01:14:10,681
Wait!

1454
01:14:11,759 --> 01:14:13,176
Wait, wait, wait!

1455
01:14:15,296 --> 01:14:16,492
Stop!

1456
01:14:16,492 --> 01:14:17,325
Hey!

1457
01:14:18,559 --> 01:14:19,666
Stop!

1458
01:14:19,666 --> 01:14:20,499
Wait!

1459
01:14:21,905 --> 01:14:22,738
Wait!

1460
01:14:23,902 --> 01:14:25,290
My wife and child are out there in the snow,

1461
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:26,123
please help me.

1462
01:14:26,123 --> 01:14:26,956
They're dying.

1463
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:38,093
I found him on the road.

1464
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,960
I thought he was a cow off the range. (chuckles)

1465
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,490
He says, "He's been in the wildlife preserve for eight days

1466
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:47,667
and his wife and his baby are still there."

1467
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:49,940
Have him?

1468
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:51,570
The kid going to Idaho.

1469
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,677
The whole world's looking for him.

1470
01:14:54,858 --> 01:14:56,191
Well, I'll be.

1471
01:14:59,047 --> 01:15:00,300
Get a hold of Doug Farley,

1472
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:01,559
and bring the big loader with you.

1473
01:15:01,559 --> 01:15:02,510
We're going up there.

1474
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:05,360
And, uh, call Cedarville, get an ambulance.

1475
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,350
Over.

1476
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:07,183
Okay, Don.

1477
01:15:07,183 --> 01:15:08,623
I got that.

1478
01:15:08,623 --> 01:15:09,456
Out.

1479
01:15:11,565 --> 01:15:14,870
Well, it's gonna take a few hours to reach 'em

1480
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:15,809
even without a blizzard.

1481
01:15:15,809 --> 01:15:17,600
And we gotta get you to the hospital in Cedarville.

1482
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,760
There's a blizzard coming?

1483
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,660
This afternoon or tonight.

1484
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:23,430
Well, then we gotta reach them now.

1485
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:27,260
Isn't there a med, medevac, a helicopter, something fast?

1486
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,903
Even if there was with a blizzard coming

1487
01:15:28,903 --> 01:15:30,420
they couldn't fly all the way up here.

1488
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:31,665
Fella, you ain't flying to that.

1489
01:15:31,665 --> 01:15:33,170
But they're dying.

1490
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:34,003
They're dying.

1491
01:15:34,003 --> 01:15:35,863
Yeah, well, doing the best we can.

1492
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:40,500
Why don't you just sit on down here,

1493
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,070
and show us on this map where they are.

1494
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:42,903
Come on.

1495
01:15:44,535 --> 01:15:46,464
(brooding music)

1496
01:15:46,464 --> 01:15:48,600
(wind blowing)

1497
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,966
You do know there's a blizzard coming.

1498
01:15:50,966 --> 01:15:53,830
Once we get 'em we still gotta get them to the hospital.

1499
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:56,100
Well, you got a better way I'm all ears.

1500
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:57,140
I'm going back.

1501
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:57,993
I can go.

1502
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:01,020
Listen, son, since Saturday

1503
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:04,050
you've already walked 30 miles in deep snow.

1504
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:06,830
It's an honest to God miracle you made it this far.

1505
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:08,940
Yes, but I know the way.

1506
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:09,863
I know I can make it.

1507
01:16:09,863 --> 01:16:12,400
There's a problem, we'll radio to you at the hospital.

1508
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,309
In your condition you'd only slow us down.

1509
01:16:14,309 --> 01:16:16,690
Blue sweatshirt on Hell's Creek Road

1510
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:17,960
on the ridge above in a cave?

1511
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,620
A cave, yeah.

1512
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:22,510
Listen, last night I heard Jen's voice.

1513
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:24,040
I know she's alive.

1514
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,493
I know they're both alive.

1515
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:27,181
Please.

1516
01:16:33,434 --> 01:16:35,014
(phone ringing)

1517
01:16:35,014 --> 01:16:36,487
(phone beeps)

1518
01:16:36,487 --> 01:16:37,684
Yeah.

1519
01:16:37,684 --> 01:16:38,518
Yeah, Joe.

1520
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:40,813
Jim's alive.

1521
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,651
Cedarville.

1522
01:16:44,651 --> 01:16:46,863
And, and Jen and the baby?

1523
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,210
Okay.

1524
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:51,367
Yeah, oh, God bless you.

1525
01:16:51,367 --> 01:16:52,484
Thank you.

1526
01:16:52,484 --> 01:16:53,820
Cedarville bingo.

1527
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:57,080
Northeast California, the Nevada border.

1528
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,063
Way up there.

1529
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:00,380
How's Jen and Clay?
Muriel.

1530
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:03,091
I just got a call from Joe Tirado, got it off the wires,

1531
01:17:03,091 --> 01:17:04,015
the found Jimmy!

1532
01:17:04,015 --> 01:17:04,848
He's alive.

1533
01:17:04,848 --> 01:17:06,707
Oh, he's alive!

1534
01:17:06,707 --> 01:17:08,061
Jimmy's alive!

1535
01:17:08,061 --> 01:17:11,579
(group cheering)

1536
01:17:11,579 --> 01:17:12,557
Shh, I can't hear.

1537
01:17:12,557 --> 01:17:15,690
And, and, and Jen and the baby, how are they?

1538
01:17:16,874 --> 01:17:18,913
Well, the report only mentions Jim.

1539
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:21,910
Well, Joe's trying to find out

1540
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:23,920
but it's so isolated up there.

1541
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:24,753
What now?

1542
01:17:24,753 --> 01:17:27,650
You take him to the closest hospital.

1543
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:28,483
Where?

1544
01:17:28,483 --> 01:17:30,540
Cedarville, California.

1545
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:31,490
We'll get there as fast as we can.

1546
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:34,793
I'll ask CHP to fly you there too.

1547
01:17:34,793 --> 01:17:36,593
Muriel, I know, I know it sounds bad

1548
01:17:37,495 --> 01:17:39,290
but we both know Jimmy.

1549
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:41,243
If he could possibly save them he would.

1550
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:44,610
I'm gonna keep these phone lines open.

1551
01:17:44,610 --> 01:17:45,540
I love you.

1552
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:46,483
I love you too.

1553
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:51,150
He was alone.

1554
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:52,250
They weren't with him.

1555
01:17:53,249 --> 01:17:55,793
(group chattering)

1556
01:17:55,793 --> 01:17:59,210
(tractor engine roaring)

1557
01:18:02,927 --> 01:18:04,173
(monitor beeping)

1558
01:18:04,173 --> 01:18:07,640
(dramatic music)

1559
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:12,640
You have severe frostbite on both your feet.

1560
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:13,950
You've been walking, son,

1561
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,940
that may have kept the circulation going.

1562
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:19,820
But we won't know for a few days.

1563
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,510
Have they found Jen yet?

1564
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:22,420
The sheriff knows.

1565
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:23,253
He's waiting.

1566
01:18:27,484 --> 01:18:29,650
(group chattering)

1567
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:31,470
Husband said, "He left Monday morning

1568
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:33,380
and they were in pretty bad shape then."

1569
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,890
It's too dangerous to fly a chopper up

1570
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:36,190
from Reno in this weather.
Yeah, yeah.

1571
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:38,460
You know if Patterson chooses the wrong port

1572
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:39,493
he could lose ours.

1573
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,030
Hi, Sheriff, are they okay?

1574
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:50,450
Well, the rescue team hasn't found them yet.

1575
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:52,290
If you could look at some maps for us.

1576
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:53,340
What, they're lost?

1577
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:55,500
Our problem is that there's two, three forks

1578
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,290
branching off Hell's Creek Road.

1579
01:18:57,290 --> 01:18:58,400
See the fresh snow

1580
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,809
has covered your tracks.

1581
01:18:59,809 --> 01:19:02,050
Do you know which fork you took?

1582
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:02,993
I can't tell.

1583
01:19:04,050 --> 01:19:05,960
I, I shoulda gone, I know exactly where they are.

1584
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,172
We, we have to go in after them.

1585
01:19:08,172 --> 01:19:09,360
There's no time, son.

1586
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,140
It's snowing too hard.

1587
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:12,330
Jim.

1588
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:14,020
Hi, I'm Rick Frazier.

1589
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:16,844
I work in the wildlife refuge, I know the terrain.

1590
01:19:16,844 --> 01:19:17,677
What?

1591
01:19:17,677 --> 01:19:20,490
Forget the map, just tell me about your walk

1592
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:22,632
from the Hell's Creek sign.

1593
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:25,140
Okay, turn right at the Hell's Creek Fork.

1594
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:27,410
Right at Hell's Creek fork?
Yeah, that's correct.

1595
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:28,470
To the right.

1596
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:30,405
Now go up and over the ridge.

1597
01:19:30,405 --> 01:19:31,238
Over.

1598
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:37,645
(wind blowing)

1599
01:19:44,413 --> 01:19:47,080
(ominous music)

1600
01:19:53,068 --> 01:19:54,443
(suspenseful music)

1601
01:19:54,443 --> 01:19:57,860
(tractor engine roaring)

1602
01:20:08,013 --> 01:20:09,218
It's there!

1603
01:20:09,218 --> 01:20:10,968
I see the sweatshirt!

1604
01:20:18,729 --> 01:20:20,062
Is anyone there?

1605
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:23,125
Mrs. Stolpa?

1606
01:20:25,669 --> 01:20:26,915
Jim.

1607
01:20:26,915 --> 01:20:27,930
Jimmy.

1608
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:29,160
He's all right.

1609
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:30,657
Your husband's all right.

1610
01:20:35,192 --> 01:20:36,356
Your child, mam.

1611
01:20:36,356 --> 01:20:38,023
Where is your child?

1612
01:20:46,385 --> 01:20:47,716
It's okay.

1613
01:20:47,716 --> 01:20:48,883
Hey's dying.

1614
01:21:01,219 --> 01:21:03,036
(monitor beeping)

1615
01:21:03,036 --> 01:21:04,210
Is he all right?

1616
01:21:04,210 --> 01:21:06,643
The doctor gave him painkillers for his feet.

1617
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:12,970
May I be beside him?

1618
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:13,803
Sure.

1619
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,677
The doctor will be in after she examines your baby.

1620
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:23,923
You okay?
Yeah.

1621
01:21:26,478 --> 01:21:29,395
(group chattering)

1622
01:21:32,413 --> 01:21:34,996
(gentle music)

1623
01:21:46,832 --> 01:21:47,665
Hi.

1624
01:21:51,221 --> 01:21:52,054
Hi.

1625
01:21:58,401 --> 01:22:00,818
My feet, I, I can't move 'em.

1626
01:22:01,803 --> 01:22:02,636
Mine too.

1627
01:22:05,414 --> 01:22:06,247
I'd be dead.

1628
01:22:06,247 --> 01:22:07,183
I know I'd be dead.

1629
01:22:08,254 --> 01:22:09,904
I don't know how but you made it.

1630
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:13,343
Wednesday, just like you said.

1631
01:22:17,243 --> 01:22:18,143
I love you, Jimmy.

1632
01:22:19,570 --> 01:22:20,903
I love you so much.

1633
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:28,603
You and Clay, that's all I thought about.

1634
01:22:31,415 --> 01:22:33,323
How you were so strong to have Clay.

1635
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:37,956
How we're going for that walk on the beach on his birthday.

1636
01:22:37,956 --> 01:22:40,789
(Jennifer laughs)

1637
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:43,763
In the cave

1638
01:22:47,741 --> 01:22:48,657
it got bad.

1639
01:22:50,726 --> 01:22:52,402
Clay, bad for Clay?

1640
01:22:52,402 --> 01:22:53,235
Mm-hmm.

1641
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:59,623
I tried to feed him, give him water, he stopped crying.

1642
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:05,777
He barely made any sound at all.

1643
01:23:07,887 --> 01:23:10,737
But he's alive, they, they told me over over the radio.

1644
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:17,950
The doctor's doing tests.

1645
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:22,470
She, um, she and the paramedics were talking

1646
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:27,470
about pneumonia, frostbite, starvation, dehydration.

1647
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:37,341
(crying) Oh, God, he got so weak.

1648
01:23:37,341 --> 01:23:38,174
Shh.

1649
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:46,313
(Jennifer crying)

1650
01:23:49,397 --> 01:23:50,693
I'm sorry.

1651
01:23:53,059 --> 01:23:54,202
I'm so sorry.

1652
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:58,077
Hey, you did the hard part.

1653
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,043
You got him back here alive.

1654
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:08,992
You brought us back together again, you, and me, and Clay.

1655
01:24:08,992 --> 01:24:11,510
(Jennifer whimpering)

1656
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:15,693
It'll be okay, I know it.

1657
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:17,883
I promise.

1658
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:21,555
(door clicks)

1659
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:23,979
Oh, there's my husband.

1660
01:24:23,979 --> 01:24:25,812
Thank you.
Okay, mam.

1661
01:24:26,741 --> 01:24:27,866
Oh.

1662
01:24:27,866 --> 01:24:29,490
(group chattering)

1663
01:24:29,490 --> 01:24:31,057
(Muriel crying)

1664
01:24:31,057 --> 01:24:32,610
You okay?
Mm-hmm.

1665
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:42,260
Have you seen him?
No.

1666
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:44,309
Just got here through the snow ourselves.

1667
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:47,482
Hi, honey.

1668
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:50,440
(group chattering)

1669
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:51,913
I'm Dr. Jorgenson.

1670
01:24:53,559 --> 01:24:54,393
Hello, Doctor.

1671
01:24:54,393 --> 01:24:55,226
Well, they've been

1672
01:24:55,226 --> 01:24:56,863
through quite an ordeal.

1673
01:24:58,520 --> 01:24:59,860
They'll be okay?

1674
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:02,720
The baby is my most immediate concern.

1675
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:03,590
We're running tests

1676
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:06,890
and doing an a chest X-ray for possible pneumonia.

1677
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:08,890
I shall have the results shortly.

1678
01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:11,483
And, and Jim and Jennifer?

1679
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:17,340
They have suffered exposure, dehydration, starvation,

1680
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:19,913
and they'll recover quickly and fully from those,

1681
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:23,623
but their feet are far more worrisome.

1682
01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:27,993
They each have severe frostbite on both their feet.

1683
01:25:30,230 --> 01:25:31,543
Can we see them?

1684
01:25:33,076 --> 01:25:36,397
(door clicks)

1685
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:37,564
Oh, my babies.

1686
01:25:39,835 --> 01:25:41,716
Thank, God.

1687
01:25:41,716 --> 01:25:42,886
Thank God, you're all right.

1688
01:25:42,886 --> 01:25:44,460
We're so sorry, we should have listened to you.

1689
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:45,700
We should have never have gone.

1690
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:47,910
We know you worry so much, if we just listened.

1691
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:49,200
It was all my fault.

1692
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,865
I mean the road was absolutely clear

1693
01:25:50,865 --> 01:25:52,480
and then there was so much snow.

1694
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,930
None of that matters now.

1695
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:57,157
Listen to me, the important thing is you're all right.

1696
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:02,410
Well, we've run all our tests on him.

1697
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:07,140
Your son is slightly dehydrated and has a bad diaper rash,

1698
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:09,123
but other than that he's fine.

1699
01:26:10,345 --> 01:26:12,763
(gentle upbeat music)
(Nurse laughs)

1700
01:26:12,763 --> 01:26:14,587
You're okay.

1701
01:26:14,587 --> 01:26:15,904
He's okay.

1702
01:26:15,904 --> 01:26:17,326
He's alive.
Come here, Clayton.

1703
01:26:17,326 --> 01:26:18,326
Come here.

1704
01:26:19,242 --> 01:26:21,005
Hi.
There's Mommy.

1705
01:26:21,005 --> 01:26:22,070
Hi.
(Clayton coos)

1706
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:24,091
Oh.
(group laughing)

1707
01:26:24,091 --> 01:26:25,340
But he was so weak.

1708
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:27,660
Babies are quite amazing.

1709
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:31,600
Some innate defense mechanism slows their metabolism

1710
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,000
and they live off their baby fat.

1711
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,723
Considering all you've been through he is quite wonderful.

1712
01:26:40,492 --> 01:26:41,325
How you doing?

1713
01:26:41,325 --> 01:26:43,237
Do you remember you promised to feed him on Wednesday?

1714
01:26:43,237 --> 01:26:44,070
I remember.

1715
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:46,903
Oh.

1716
01:26:46,903 --> 01:26:47,950
Here we go.

1717
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:52,452
Dear Diary, we're alive, and Clay's great.

1718
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,860
Thank you, God, for overlooking the things I said,

1719
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:59,153
for allowing me to write these words.

1720
01:27:06,450 --> 01:27:08,790
After one night in Cedarville we were transferred to Reno

1721
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:10,890
for treatment of our frostbite.

1722
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:13,890
And here there are reporters from all over the world,

1723
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:17,316
like we're big stars, just because we got stuck in the snow.

1724
01:27:17,316 --> 01:27:19,880
(door clicks)
(group chattering)

1725
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,365
Jennifer, Jim, how ya feeling?

1726
01:27:21,365 --> 01:27:22,282
Oh, okay.

1727
01:27:23,230 --> 01:27:26,840
Over and over, I thought we were gonna die,

1728
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:30,353
but Jim promised to get us out of there and he did.

1729
01:27:32,110 --> 01:27:33,949
He's more than a hero to me.

1730
01:27:33,949 --> 01:27:36,040
(camera snaps)

1731
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:37,963
I couldn't have picked anyone better.

1732
01:27:39,116 --> 01:27:40,934
(camera snaps)

1733
01:27:40,934 --> 01:27:42,780
(Clayton cooing)

1734
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:45,890
Uh, Jim, Jennifer, what about your feet?

1735
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:49,096
Does the possibility of losing them frighten you?

1736
01:27:49,096 --> 01:27:50,153
(water bubbling)

1737
01:27:50,153 --> 01:27:52,253
Sure, we're frightened, who wouldn't be?

1738
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:55,250
But when you've almost lost your baby,

1739
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:57,960
when the experts can't believe you're alive,

1740
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:00,800
even if one or both of us never walks again,

1741
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,750
we'll just face it together the way we did the snow

1742
01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:06,660
and be thankful we're still here.

1743
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:13,190
Someone sent booties and mittens for Clay.

1744
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:15,243
She says, "Sorry, they're a few weeks late."

1745
01:28:15,243 --> 01:28:17,320
(group laughing)

1746
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:18,153
Hey, I thought you said

1747
01:28:18,153 --> 01:28:19,790
you were too old for stuffed animals?

1748
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:21,540
I was, I brang him for you

1749
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:24,594
since the real Pooh can't come to the hospital.

1750
01:28:24,594 --> 01:28:25,964
Oh, well.

1751
01:28:25,964 --> 01:28:26,964
(knuckles tapping)

1752
01:28:26,964 --> 01:28:28,621
Oh, hey, Doc.

1753
01:28:28,621 --> 01:28:29,454
Hi, Jim.

1754
01:28:32,230 --> 01:28:33,830
Jimmy, Jen, should we?

1755
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:36,573
No, stay, we're a family, we should all hear this.

1756
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:43,580
I'm afraid that the frostbite was just too severe.

1757
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,890
In order to prevent infection, gangrene,

1758
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:47,870
we're going to have to remove

1759
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:50,320
between a quarter and third of each of your feet.

1760
01:28:52,557 --> 01:28:53,657
I'm really very sorry.

1761
01:29:02,843 --> 01:29:07,093
We talked about that risk when we left the truck.

1762
01:29:09,438 --> 01:29:11,960
Will we be able to walk again?

1763
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,530
Well, there is a new surgical procedure

1764
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:15,050
that involves taking muscle and tissue

1765
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:16,720
from other parts of the body and using that

1766
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:18,780
to reconstruct the foot.

1767
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:21,809
We hope that that will give you the ability to walk.

1768
01:29:21,809 --> 01:29:23,809
But in the case of such severe frostbite

1769
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:26,520
we can't be sure of a good result.

1770
01:29:31,459 --> 01:29:32,770
(birds chirping)

1771
01:29:32,770 --> 01:29:34,450
For months after the surgery

1772
01:29:34,450 --> 01:29:36,383
we were in wheelchairs or on crutches.

1773
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:38,930
And all through our rehab and therapy

1774
01:29:38,930 --> 01:29:40,870
Jim insisted we would one day take Clay

1775
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:43,063
for a walk on Santa Rosarita Beach.

1776
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:47,353
That was the promise we made before he left us at the cave.

1777
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:51,809
But I didn't have his strength.

1778
01:29:51,809 --> 01:29:54,443
I was afraid he would have to leave me behind again.

1779
01:30:07,023 --> 01:30:09,510
You see that sand over there?

1780
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:12,500
That's where your mom and dad first came after the prom,

1781
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:15,233
talked about you, and your brothers and sisters.

1782
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:30,433
Jim, I'm not ready.

1783
01:30:31,346 --> 01:30:32,517
You go.

1784
01:30:32,517 --> 01:30:34,550
This time I'm not leaving you.

1785
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:36,043
I'm never leaving you again.

1786
01:30:37,437 --> 01:30:40,854
(gentle inspiring music)

1787
01:30:56,088 --> 01:30:58,838
(Clayton cooing)

1788
01:31:03,465 --> 01:31:06,298
(Jennifer laughs)

1789
01:31:11,585 --> 01:31:13,380
(laughs) Ooh.

1790
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:15,797
(Jim laughs)

1791
01:31:22,305 --> 01:31:23,488
There you go.

1792
01:31:23,488 --> 01:31:24,488
There we go.

1793
01:31:25,957 --> 01:31:26,790
Ready?

1794
01:31:29,006 --> 01:31:34,006
(Jim laughing)
(Clayton cooing)

1795
01:31:35,299 --> 01:31:36,466
You all right?

1796
01:31:37,766 --> 01:31:39,719
Mm-hmm. (laughing)

1797
01:31:39,719 --> 01:31:41,564
Remember the last time we walked here at Christmas?

1798
01:31:41,564 --> 01:31:42,397
Uh-huh.

1799
01:31:43,763 --> 01:31:44,596
Oh, Jen,

1800
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:50,233
I love you so much.

1801
01:31:52,830 --> 01:31:54,379
(Jennifer laughing)

1802
01:31:54,379 --> 01:31:57,546
(gentle upbeat music)

1803
01:32:03,919 --> 01:32:04,752
Whoa.

1805
01:32:33,303 --> 01:32:38,303

(upbeat music)
