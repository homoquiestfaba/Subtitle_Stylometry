1
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,144
You must be so excited
for your new tennis lesson, huh?

2
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:45,412
Yeah.

3
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,414
Who's my coach, Mom?

4
00:00:48,016 --> 00:00:49,116
You'll see.

5
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:50,484
Ready?

6
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:52,654
Nice.

7
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:54,388
Oh, that's nice.

8
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:57,124
- He does that on purpose,
I swear, right?

9
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,293
He has to. Oh, yeah!

10
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,695
You know, he's doing it for us.

11
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:05,132
What's up, ladies.

12
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,534
Party's here.

13
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:07,467
Alexis!

14
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:09,269
-Yes!
-Bam, Alexis!

15
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,006
Wine purse,
she's got the wine purse.

16
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:20,815
So as I was saying,
I'm in downtown LA
in the Fabric District, okay.

17
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:23,651
Hours in the sun,
I am sweating my balls off.

18
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:28,221
This guy named Tony,
tall, handsome, green eyes--

19
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,457
-Mm, sexy. I like that.
-Yes.

20
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:33,628
Follows me
into the dollar fabric store,

21
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,831
compliments my legs,
and yada, yada, yada,

22
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:39,132
I'm back at his loft downtown.

23
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,735
- No!
- Oh!

24
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,670
What if he was
a murderer or a rapist?

25
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:45,640
Sometimes you gotta just
trust your instincts, Alexis.

26
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,308
- Look around and find out,
am I right?

27
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,981
So, she brings me
another double scotch,

28
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,016
and I, like, pull out some cash.

29
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,618
And she's like, "Oh, no,

30
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:58,151
we're not allowed
to accept tips."

31
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,921
And I'm like,
"Oh, baby, that's too bad

32
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:02,957
- because I got a tip
I really wanted you to see."

33
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:04,726
- Am I right?
So she's laughing...
- Yeah.

34
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,661
...because it's fucking funny,
right? And I'm like,

35
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,731
"Okay, here's my fucking chance.
I mean, it's on my bucket list,

36
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:12,066
I'm flying first class,
I gotta do it, right?"

37
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,268
Marco, you get your ass
over here, you gotta hear this.

38
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,539
I'm telling him
how I became part
of the Mile High Club Elite.

39
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:21,676
Oh, geez!
Shit, I'm part of that club.

40
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,244
Have you sucked
a girl's pussy at 35,000 feet?

41
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:25,980
-What?
-I said, "Elite."

42
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:30,818
Wait, how the hell
did you go down on a girl
in a tiny-ass bathroom?

43
00:02:30,952 --> 00:02:32,486
Acrobatics, bro.

44
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,555
Now, mind you. I have been out

45
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,824
in the hot sun, sweating, okay?

46
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,926
And now
I'm in this guy's bathroom

47
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,496
looking for wipes or something
to refresh myself, okay?

48
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,832
So, under his sink
he has some baby powder.

49
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,934
I sprinkle some
on my cooch, thinking,

50
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:49,070
"He won't know,
no big deal, it's just sex."

51
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,872
But then he decides

52
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,074
to check out the landing strip.

53
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,474
-Oh my God, stop!
-No!

54
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:57,578
Oh, yes. And I am
lying there mortified,

55
00:02:57,712 --> 00:03:00,247
hands over my face thinking,
"I should stop him.

56
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,481
I should really stop this guy,

57
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:03,051
holy fuck,
I should stop this guy."

58
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,253
Then I'm like, "Oh, whatever."
And I let him do it.

59
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,057
Oh my God, you're such a whore!

60
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,558
- Thank you.
- I love it.

61
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,795
She's got one leg
up on the counter.

62
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:17,065
I'm holding the other one up
and I'm just going to town,
all right.

63
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,232
Now, this chick,
so fucking loud,

64
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,136
- the last row in coach
could hear her, okay.

65
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,005
And he thinks he's done,
comes up for air,

66
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:25,606
and he has white powder
all over his face.

67
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,274
Except now it looks like

68
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,977
-clumps of white dough.
-Oh!

69
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:32,080
-And I'm real distracted.
-Oh!

70
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,149
- All I can think about
is baking a pie.

71
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,151
Now, she's finally coming,
right?

72
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:41,155
-She begins to squirt
all over the place.
-Oh!

73
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:45,225
- You got a squirter!
Oh, you lucky fuck!
- Yeah! Yeah!

74
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,427
She's hanging on the wall,
fucking Spider-Man.

75
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:48,796
- She's got a leg up
on the counter...

76
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,330
...I'm grabbing
fucking paper towels,

77
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:51,599
shoving them under the door

78
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:52,834
to keep the first class cabin

79
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,301
from flooding, okay?

80
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,236
Fuck the oxygen masks,
drop down scuba tanks!

81
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:58,773
So I figured I'd
return the favor

82
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,441
and head down south,
when I realize

83
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,911
his balls are the size
of fucking martini onions.

84
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:05,213
He's a Gibson?

85
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,147
Wait, I thought that's a myth.

86
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,882
Fricking unicorn, right?

87
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,584
Get this, he has two kids.

88
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,519
- How?
- I don't know.

89
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,454
How about you and I
get a burger later, Tomas?

90
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:16,691
Thank you, Natalie,
but I am vegan.

91
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,760
Fuck you, Tomas.
You're not vegan.

92
00:04:18,893 --> 00:04:20,862
The only reason you're
a yoga instructor

93
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:21,996
is for the hot chicks.

94
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,966
Stop snooping, Estanley.

95
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,968
What? 'Sup, Debby.

96
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,136
Hey, baby.

97
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,637
Okay, back to Gibson guy.

98
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:32,339
So, I mean, did you
even feel anything?

99
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,242
You'll probably get
to fuck him again.

100
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,111
Girl, hell no. There's more.

101
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:40,413
Tony dreamy, green-eyes Gibson

102
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:43,416
asked me to put a finger
into his ass.

103
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,753
That's just a shitty situation.

104
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:50,258
Ladies, focus. This is yoga.

105
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,528
Bob, didn't you say you took
your girlfriend Gloria
on that trip to Ireland?

106
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:56,264
Yeah. But I bought her
a ticket in coach.

107
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,468
This motherfucker.

108
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,337
Oh, Marco, look.
Let's do the deal.

109
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:06,406
-Let's do the deal. All right?
-All right.

110
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,177
Here's what we do.
We buy three properties.

111
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,145
Grenada, Ventura, Simi.

112
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,313
All right? But here's the deal.

113
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:14,949
Every time we meet,

114
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,884
you gotta bring
this motherfucker!

115
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:18,886
- I never laughed
so much in my life.

116
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,756
-This fucking guy.
-Bobby, coming in my pocket,
all right?

117
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,891
Hey, as long
as he doesn't cum in your mouth.

118
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:28,563
<i>♪ Stardust ♪</i>

119
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:31,299
<i>♪ Gripping on the ocean floor ♪</i>

120
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,434
Marco, baby, all I'm saying is

121
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:36,070
put yourself in my shoes.

122
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:38,206
You say you're gonna go
to Phil's to be at his office

123
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,774
and do some paperwork stuff,

124
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,876
which is why you can't make it
to tennis practice,

125
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,545
and suddenly there's a post
on Tom's social media

126
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:45,813
of the three of you golfing.

127
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:48,481
Baby, I'm sorry,
I sent you a text

128
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:50,518
that didn't go through.
You know how shitty

129
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,419
the service is in Porter Ranch.

130
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,423
See, wasn't sent.

131
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,426
Oh, wait, oh, wait.

132
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,497
Okay. Okay.

133
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,499
You're right.

134
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:09,837
-Babe, I had to take it.
-I know you do.

135
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:13,007
-Trust me.
-I trust you.

136
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:16,711
-Oh!
-Oh! That's a party foul,

137
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,613
-you better hurry up.
-Mm-hmm.

138
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,581
- Mm.
- Whoo! It's good.

139
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:23,584
- Date night.
Let's go. Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

140
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,887
-Date night. No kids tonight.
-Okay.

141
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,954
Okay. Hell yeah,

142
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:29,557
it's-- oh, oh.

143
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,158
-Oh, here we go.
-The babysitter. Babysitter.

144
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,560
-Babysitter time.
-Let's go.

145
00:06:32,994 --> 00:06:35,129
- Go-- Babysitter.
- Let's do it. Let's do it.

146
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,065
I made popcorn for you and Emma,
you can watch a movie,

147
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,935
-but she needs to be
in bed by eight, okay?
-Okay.

148
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:42,703
Thank you.

149
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,641
And don't invite any boys.

150
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,009
Boys?

151
00:06:49,277 --> 00:06:51,712
You couldn't have found
a more awkward girl.

152
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:55,549
What? Get a pretty sitter
so you can stare at her tits
and ass and wanna fuck her?

153
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:56,483
I ain't no fool.

154
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,663
Yeah, a Gibson.
I feel so bad for her.

155
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,231
I told her she has
to see him again.

156
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:12,166
I've known Debby for 20 years,

157
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,669
and she's always dated
the strangest dudes.

158
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:18,673
You and she
never really hooked up?

159
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,909
She's like a sister.

160
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,846
Speaking of the devil.

161
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:28,783
No!

162
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,519
-What's wrong?
-Greg and Julia
are getting a divorce.

163
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,088
Oh, damn. Are you serious?

164
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,223
They didn't even lead on
that they were having
any issues.

165
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:38,592
Babe, I'm sad.
I really liked them together.

166
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:40,460
Well, I can tell you one thing.

167
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,530
They are in for a wild ride.

168
00:07:43,097 --> 00:07:45,967
-Divorce fucking sucks.
-Oh my God, yes.

169
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,636
The being angry at each other
while having to co-parent--

170
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,037
Oh, the mind game.

171
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:52,540
-The hurt. The guilt--
-Avoiding friends,

172
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,209
-having to choose friends--
-Dating.

173
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:57,645
Having to fill out
those dating apps again.

174
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,380
I swear to God,
every box that you check off,

175
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,315
it feels like you're stripping
your bobos in front of lions.

176
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:03,851
"What's your full name?"
There goes your top.

177
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:05,519
"What's your hobbies?"
There goes your bra.

178
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:06,921
"What kind of person
are you into?"

179
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:08,422
There goes your chonees.
Before you know it,

180
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:09,924
you're naked
in front of the world.

181
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:11,859
Remember those days, babe?

182
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:13,995
No. I always wanted
to get on those apps,

183
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:16,597
I thought it'd be fun,
but I never got the chance.

184
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:17,765
-No?
-No.

185
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,834
I was alone for four months.

186
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:21,235
And then I met you.

187
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:22,903
And that was it for me.

188
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:24,472
- Four months?
- Mm-hmm.

189
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,440
You can't go two days
without fucking.

190
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:31,412
It was the weirdest thing.
My ex-wife's friends
all reached out to me.

191
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,713
-You're kidding.
-Nope.

192
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,149
They were like, "Are you okay?

193
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,751
Tell us if there's anything
we can do for you.

194
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,253
Let's go out for 'coffee.'"

195
00:08:39,387 --> 00:08:40,654
Yada, yada, yada.

196
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,323
<i>Cochinadas</i> ensued.

197
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:46,260
And you went along
with these <i>cochinadas?</i>

198
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:48,429
You fucked your wife's friends?

199
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:53,034
My ex-wife.
You're my wife. And yes.

200
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:58,507
Women are strange
about these things.

201
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:00,541
Men don't do that.
It's bad karma.

202
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,810
Of course men do that, okay?

203
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:06,313
We're not even divorced,
and I see some of your friends
giving me the look.

204
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,949
-What look?
-You know, the,

205
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,452
"I've been stuck
in the desert and I just saw

206
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:13,554
a chilled beer" look.

207
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:16,123
-Thirsty.
-They may look,

208
00:09:16,257 --> 00:09:18,759
but my boys aren't gonna
reach out if you and I break up.

209
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:21,128
You don't date your friend's ex.

210
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:22,630
That's bro code, bro.

211
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:26,367
Imagine if word got out
that we were separating.

212
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:30,738
I wonder which one of my friends
would reach out to you first.

213
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:38,079
-Have no clue.
-What if we pretended
to get separated?

214
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:42,383
- Divorce bait everyone,
see who hits you up first.

215
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:44,852
That is a terrible idea.

216
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,688
Babe, you know how hard it is
to cover up a lie.

217
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:51,092
I mean,
shit gets freaking crazy.

218
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:52,927
-And how do you know?
-My ex.

219
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,262
She was so stressed
about the affair

220
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:58,099
that she was having
during our marriage,

221
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,234
-she got a white pube.
-Ew.

222
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,435
How the hell do you kno--

223
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:04,071
You know what?
I don't even wanna know.

224
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,410
Oh my God, babe. There's Greg.

225
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:10,978
Don't look!

226
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:14,381
Oh, he's so sad and lonely.

227
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:17,351
-We should invite him
to join us.
-No, Alexis!

228
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:20,054
Just leave him alone,
it'll be awkward.

229
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:21,989
Divorce is rough, babe.

230
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:24,692
He's our friend.
We need to support him.

231
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,296
Oh, hey, babe.
The whole town is here.

232
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,966
It's Tina, <i>La Cochina.</i>

233
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:35,202
This motherfucker!

234
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:38,005
-Oh, wow.
-The body's not even cold yet.

235
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,840
Alexis, just leave it alone.

236
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,642
-I'm gonna go over there.
-No, you're not.

237
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:42,843
You're gonna sit down,
you're gonna enjoy

238
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:44,211
this amazing salad.

239
00:10:46,615 --> 00:10:49,383
-...sexy.
-Thank you.
I like your scent, too,

240
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:50,818
-what is it?
-It's, uh, soap.

241
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,287
Fuck that.
I want to see what's going on.

242
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,755
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

243
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,525
-No.
-He needs my support, okay?

244
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,026
Maybe he's okay. Maybe he's not.

245
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,428
-You don't know.
-He's fine, babe, sit down.

246
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:02,763
Babe, sit--

247
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:07,536
Hey, guys!
How's it going?

248
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,770
-Hey, guys.
-Hey!

249
00:11:09,904 --> 00:11:11,606
Greg, how's Julia?

250
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:13,474
I don't know if you've heard--

251
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:15,309
Oh, I've heard.

252
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,745
Tina... nice dress.

253
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,847
Thanks. I got it
at this little boutique on--

254
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,482
Where're your five kids?

255
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:23,150
At their five babies' daddies?

256
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:25,654
I have three,
and they're at home with my mom.

257
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,556
-Oh. Yeah.
-She must be a saint.

258
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,659
So what are we doing here?

259
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:34,395
- Well, we'r-- hanging out.
- We're just hanging out.

260
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:37,431
Oh, hanging out?
They're just hanging out.

261
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:39,400
-Yeah, that's what they said,
they're han--
-Just hanging out.

262
00:11:39,534 --> 00:11:42,436
-Hanging out.
-Okay, so that's
what we do nowadays,

263
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:44,004
we just hang out.

264
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:45,674
Well, Tina,
you look very pretty.

265
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,241
Thank you.

266
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:52,413
Hey, Greg,
Julia, is she all right?

267
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:55,082
-Hell, man, are you all right?
-Yeah.

268
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:57,686
We're getting through it,
but, um...

269
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:58,986
it's hard.

270
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:00,921
Is it hard?

271
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:03,558
-Okay. All right.
-Is it hard right now?

272
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:05,759
Uh, Alexis, we're gonna--

273
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,428
-hey, guys, have a good evening.
-Thank you.

274
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:09,863
We're just...
yeah, we'll let you guys

275
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:11,966
-keep hanging out. Okay.
-Let's go.

276
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,503
-Okay.
-Wow.

277
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:20,808
Alexis, what the hell?

278
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:24,044
You can't just go over
to someone and just boom,
go right into them.

279
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:25,980
They're hanging out? Okay,

280
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:27,815
is that what we call
fucking these days?

281
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,117
They're fucking.
They've got the look.

282
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,319
Alexis,
it's none of your business.

283
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:34,888
They're adults, they can do
whatever the hell they want!

284
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:37,458
Shit's not right. What the hell?

285
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:44,666
What are you doing?

286
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:46,967
-Well...
-Are you videotaping them?

287
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,379
- Hi.
- Hi, guys.

288
00:12:58,513 --> 00:12:59,480
- Good morning.
- Hi.

289
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:00,548
Morning.

290
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:04,519
Will you still love me
when we're that old?

291
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,253
Absolutely.

292
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,558
Think we'll
still enjoy lovemaking?

293
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:14,428
Hell yeah! Even when your boobs
are down to your knees,

294
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:15,730
I'll still tap that.

295
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:17,131
Tap that!

296
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,099
-Okay. Oh, oh. Like that?
-Oh, oh, oh, oh.

297
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:20,401
-Like that? Okay, okay.
-Yeah. Yes.

298
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:22,469
Babe, stop.

299
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:25,239
-You're so romantic.
-I know.

300
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:28,242
I'm sorry I was tripping, babe.

301
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,978
It's okay. I get it.

302
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:33,615
They're our friends,
and you care.

303
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:38,419
-Yep.
-All right, last one
to the coffee shop has to pay.

304
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,954
Yeah! Come on.

305
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,890
There's this, like,
seven-minute ab video

306
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,760
-that I want us to do.
It's incredible.
-You wanna keep working out?

307
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,295
- I kind of just wanna
Netflix and chill.
- Yeah. I j--

308
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:49,863
Oh, here we go.

309
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,636
-Julia! I got you, girl.
-Oh, Alexis. Hey.

310
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:56,937
-I got you, okay?
-What?

311
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:59,541
-I heard.
-Oh. Uh-huh, yeah, I'm fine.

312
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:01,543
- Okay. Hey--
- Hey, Julia.

313
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:03,010
Hey, Marco. How's it going?

314
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,279
Before you hear
from anyone else, all right,

315
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:08,215
we saw Tina and Greg
at a restaurant.

316
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:11,051
- Oh... yeah. Oh, no.
- He's such an asshole.

317
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:14,154
-Alexis, please, stop,
stop, babe, stop, okay.
-I'm here if you need anything.

318
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:15,422
-Okay.
-Julia, are you okay?

319
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:16,924
-Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.
-See, babe?

320
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,492
-Yeah. Yeah.
-She's okay. Let's go.

321
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:21,495
Okay, good. Hey, if you need
anything at all, okay?

322
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:23,130
-You call me, all right?
You wanna have...
-Oh. Okay.

323
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:24,532
...a glass of wine, you call me.

324
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,300
-Thank you. Thank you. Okay.
-All right?

325
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,235
You wanna put a spell
on Greg's dick to shrink it?

326
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:30,237
-You call me, okay?
I know a lady...
-Oh.

327
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:32,005
-...who will Vienna sausage
that motherfucker.
-Oh.

328
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,273
- Okay.
-  -We're gonna get our coffee.

329
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:34,843
- Thank you.
- Okay, Bye.

330
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,544
What the hell was that?

331
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,581
- I parked the car.
- Hey--

332
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:42,149
-See,
chivalry is not dead, baby.
-Bob, Bob, not now. Bob!

333
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:43,651
-Bob, get down.
-Oh!

334
00:14:43,785 --> 00:14:45,820
-Bob? Bob!
-Marco!

335
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,121
-What up, bro?
-Look, it's Bob.

336
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,022
Hey, bitty-bitty Bob-Bob.

337
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:50,924
Whoo!

338
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:54,027
And Julia. Mm, what's up?

339
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,897
You know, we're
just hanging out.

340
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,166
- Hanging out?
I heard that one before.
- Yeah.

341
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,334
-They're hanging out, babe.
-Yeah.

342
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:01,969
- Yeah.
- Because that's

343
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,270
what we do nowadays, right?

344
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:04,905
- We hang out, huh...
- Yeah.

345
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,306
...we don't call it
fucking anymore?

346
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,576
- What? No. What?
- Okay. Yeah.

347
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:14,114
Don't you just love
how everybody's
hanging out these days?

348
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:17,552
How about you guys?
Are you just kind of
hanging out?

349
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:19,386
He's my brother.

350
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:21,556
We are hanging out.

351
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:24,726
-Alexis, they're kids!
-All right, Alexis.

352
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,661
What the heck is going on?

353
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:29,029
Alexis,
it's not what it looks like.

354
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:34,101
We're just... helping each other
get through a rough patch.

355
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,036
-Whatever. Okay.
-Yeah.

356
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,572
- Marco?
- Whatever.

357
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:40,274
I-- Hey, we're going home,
and we're gonna hang out.

358
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,075
He means fucking.

359
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,581
If you're steps, it's okay.

360
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:51,285
Alexis, please stop.

361
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,487
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
I don't wanna be running

362
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:55,557
with hot coffee spilling
all over me.

363
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,325
Baby, what has gotten into you?

364
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,596
It's none of our business.
These are adults.

365
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:02,831
They are our friends.

366
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,031
I don't know what's going on,

367
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,867
but I can't trust these bitches.

368
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:09,069
They all wanna hang out.
They probably wanna
hang out with you.

369
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:10,370
-Of course.
-Mm-hmm.

370
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:12,306
Because I'm
fucking irresistible.

371
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,308
Okay. I-- I can't with you.

372
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,410
Oh, come on, Alexis,
that was funny.

373
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:19,046
Alexis, come on!

374
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,283
Baby, just let it go.

375
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,887
You can't show up
to a parent-teacher conference

376
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:29,490
all pissed off about something
that we have no control over.

377
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:32,426
I mean, you're liable to stab
the teacher with a pencil

378
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,863
if she gives us
a bad report about Emma.

379
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,998
All right?
Just relax. It's okay.

380
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:39,801
Come on,
take a deep breath for me.

381
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:41,903
Let's go, inhale.

382
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,271
Blow it up.

383
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,409
We're getting a divorce?

384
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:51,746
What did you do?

385
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,281
What did you do?

386
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,083
I'm gonna test
these people, okay?

387
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,151
I put on my Face page

388
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:02,055
- that we may or may not
be getting a divorce.

389
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,124
What?

390
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:09,029
Alexis, delete the post, please.

391
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:12,099
-This is ridiculous.
-I'm gonna leave it up
for 24 hours.

392
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,002
See which one
of our friends, okay,

393
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,670
- is gonna reach out
to you to hang out!

394
00:17:15,803 --> 00:17:17,639
Twenty-four hours?
No, you're not,

395
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:19,741
-you're gonna
take it down now.
-No, I can't, okay?

396
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:21,809
- I can't trust these hoes,
all right?

397
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:23,277
As a matter of fact,
give me your phone.

398
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,646
-Let me see who's--
-Just-- no!

399
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:26,346
Baby, we're gonna get
in an accident.

400
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,149
-How?
-You're acting crazy here.

401
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:32,185
No, I'm gonna divorce bait
these bitches, okay?

402
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,922
I am not losing another man

403
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,591
to one of these
backstabbing hoes, all right?

404
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:39,727
Hey, relax, Cardi B.
You're not gonna lose me!

405
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:42,062
I know, okay?
And I'm gonna make sure of that.

406
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,330
Okay.

407
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:48,570
Baby, wait for me.

408
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:50,838
Hi.

416
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,460
Hello, Mrs. Laguna.
Hello, Mr. Laguna.

417
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:15,863
-Hi, Miss Beach.
-Right this way.

418
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:20,668
First of all, I am sorry

419
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:23,538
for what you both
are experiencing at home.

420
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,474
-Divorce is sticky.
-Thanks.

421
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:30,011
Well, we're still trying
to work things out, Miss Beach.

422
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,311
Call me Barbara.

423
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:38,586
But I do have to say,
I was happy to hear the news.

424
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,386
What?

425
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,788
It definitely explains

426
00:18:40,922 --> 00:18:42,389
a lot of Emma's behavior.

427
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,092
It's pretty classic textbook

428
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,827
for families
going through a divorce,

429
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,029
a second one for Emma,
in this case.

430
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:51,599
The assignment was to write
about your favorite room
in the house

431
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,568
and give three reasons
why it's her favorite.

432
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:55,837
"The dark chamber
we call the basement

433
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,805
is my favorite room in our home.

434
00:18:57,939 --> 00:19:01,174
It's spooky, and strange sounds
are heard in the dark.

435
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,944
It's awesome!"

436
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:04,177
What the fuck?

437
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:07,381
- Oh, sorry.
- No.

438
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:09,083
In this other essay,

439
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:12,285
she's asked to write about
a family member she admires.

440
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,188
She wrote about her father,
Adam Sandler.

441
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,423
The guy from <i>Uncut Gems?</i>

442
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:20,128
<i>Uncut Gems.</i>

443
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,696
<i>Bedtime Stories,</i>
babe, remember?

444
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:23,497
We watched it together
as a family.

445
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:25,033
That was a good movie.

446
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,968
Okay. Uh, Barbara--

447
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:28,136
It's Miss Beach.

448
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,605
We'll talk to her.
How are her grades?

449
00:19:30,738 --> 00:19:33,041
Other than that, Emma's doing
really well in class.

450
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,009
Amazing, as I expected.

451
00:19:35,143 --> 00:19:36,678
Okay, I think we're done here.

452
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:44,652
Thank you
for being so understanding.

453
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:45,887
You're welcome.

454
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,321
Bye-bye, Barbara.

455
00:19:49,157 --> 00:19:50,058
Bye!

456
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:57,297
So what the hell is up
with Emma's essays?

457
00:19:57,732 --> 00:20:01,468
-What's up with Miss Beach?
-Maybe you should focus on Emma.

458
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:04,639
Might be a good distraction

459
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:07,207
from this ridiculous
divorce baiting you've started.

460
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,576
Did you not see them?

461
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,045
I have to admit,
the parents were acting weird.

462
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:12,146
-So what?
-I told you.

463
00:20:12,547 --> 00:20:14,882
You never know
who it's gonna be.

464
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:20,688
- Okay. What are you doing now
with my phone?

465
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:22,824
Michelle? Wow.

466
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:25,325
I knew this bitch was always
liking your posts too much.

467
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,128
That's a client's wife.

468
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,763
Un-fucking-friend.

469
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:31,331
-Huh.
-If you're worried about me,

470
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:32,767
just delete that post.

471
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,902
I can't believe
I just posted this...

472
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:36,604
-You know what?
-...and they're
already commenting!

473
00:20:36,738 --> 00:20:39,574
-No, it's my Facebook, okay?
-Wow! Please.

474
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:41,475
Is it--
does it have your name on it?

475
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:43,678
-Doesn't it say, "Marco Laguna"?
-Right.

476
00:20:43,811 --> 00:20:45,680
Does your Facebook say,
"Marco Laguna"?

477
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:46,914
Wow!

478
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:51,686
Huh!

479
00:20:53,654 --> 00:20:56,157
This motherfucker!

480
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:58,926
Okay, son of a bitch.
You want to play?

481
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,994
Estanley!

482
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:03,197
You piece of shit!

483
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,699
You reach out to my wife, huh?

484
00:21:04,832 --> 00:21:06,433
I thought
we were supposed to be boys.

485
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,035
Come out, you asshole.

486
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:11,172
What's with all
the commotion out here?

487
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:15,143
How dare you ask
my wife to hang out?

488
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,276
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

489
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,812
In my defense,

490
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:21,249
A, she's not gonna be
your wife much longer,

491
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:23,951
and B, frankly,
it's your fault.

492
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:25,620
How the fuck is it my fault?

493
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:27,555
When you got
a beautiful hand model

494
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:30,558
to lower her standards
when she married you, bro,

495
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:32,994
you made me believe
that I had a chance.

496
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:34,695
You see?

497
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:36,831
No, wait, wait, wait.

498
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:40,768
Okay.

499
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:44,138
- You...
- You son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch!

500
00:21:44,272 --> 00:21:45,673
Get off of me! Get off of me!

501
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:48,142
Ooh. Oh, wait.

502
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:50,310
Bro, I know you're afraid.

503
00:21:50,845 --> 00:21:52,880
I know you're petrified.
You keep thinking

504
00:21:53,014 --> 00:21:55,616
how you'll never live
without her by your side.

505
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,152
-Oh, look, killer bees.
-Eh! Eh!

506
00:22:00,288 --> 00:22:02,489
-You're going to spend
so many nights...
-Yeah.

507
00:22:02,623 --> 00:22:04,659
...thinking
how she did you wrong.

508
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,594
-But you'll grow strong.
-Yeah.

509
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:10,531
You'll learn how to get along.

510
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:12,800
-Are you quoting Gloria Gaynor?
-I sure am, my love.

511
00:22:12,934 --> 00:22:15,803
-You like it? Oh!
-It's fake, you moron!

512
00:22:15,937 --> 00:22:18,239
All right! Okay, okay!

513
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:20,708
Bro. I have chronic halitosis.

514
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:23,911
-Truce? Right.
-Yeah, sure. Right.

515
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:26,446
Truce.

516
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:28,182
What's fake?

517
00:22:28,316 --> 00:22:29,650
The post.

518
00:22:29,784 --> 00:22:31,586
It isn't real, you fool.

519
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:33,821
Alexis is divorce baiting
everybody.

520
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:34,789
Divorce whating?

521
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:36,423
Divorce baiting.

522
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:38,292
She wants to find out
who she can trust,

523
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:42,029
so she put the fake post up
that we're getting a divorce.

524
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:44,298
-It's fake?
-Yes.

525
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:47,367
What is wrong
with you fucking crazies?

526
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,605
That's not right.
I was set up to fail.

527
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:53,241
You're setting
everyone up to fail.

528
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:01,215
You know what?

529
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:02,783
You two deserve each other.

530
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:04,719
You are both fucked-up people.

531
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:07,922
And I am disgusted
with the both of you.

532
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,228
And get off my lawn!

533
00:23:14,362 --> 00:23:16,496
This isn't even your lawn!

534
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:20,868
I feel so violated.

535
00:23:21,903 --> 00:23:24,572
-Am I like a victim now?
-She's crazy.

536
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:26,574
That's what I get
for marrying a model.

537
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:28,910
Models be crazy, man.

538
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:31,379
It's all those salads
and Pilates and shit.

539
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:32,780
Bitches need a burrito.

540
00:23:32,914 --> 00:23:35,149
You fuckers know
I can hear you, right?

541
00:23:37,218 --> 00:23:39,452
Alexis, you need
to take down the post, baby.

542
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:40,821
People can get hurt.

543
00:23:40,955 --> 00:23:43,357
Look what we've done
to poor Estanley.

544
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,359
Fuck no.

545
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:46,594
Oh, I'll take that.

546
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:47,995
- Hey, give me--
- Oh.

547
00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:49,530
-I got it.
-Tell me what it says.

548
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:50,463
Tell me what it says!

549
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:51,999
Alexis, these texts

550
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:53,234
are all condolences.

551
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:54,335
Tracey just reached out

552
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:55,636
to say that she's heartbroken.

553
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,171
Thank you, <i>hermano.</i>

554
00:23:57,939 --> 00:24:00,241
That's what I've
been trying to tell her.

555
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:03,377
Tracey wants
to have your babies.

556
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:05,445
Come on.

557
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:10,418
-See.
-It's nothing.

558
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:13,921
Ask her to go out tomorrow
and have coffee in the morning.

559
00:24:14,055 --> 00:24:16,924
Uh-uh. Because you're gonna
take it down tonight,

560
00:24:17,058 --> 00:24:18,993
which would make that
unnecessary.

561
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:21,329
I'm not taking
anything down until you go
on that coffee date.

562
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,732
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That was not part
of our agreement.

563
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:27,034
Technically,
I agreed in the late afternoon,

564
00:24:27,168 --> 00:24:29,136
so I'm not breaking
any agreement.

565
00:24:29,737 --> 00:24:31,539
Go and have coffee
and you'll see.

566
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:33,040
Then, I can kill her.

567
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:35,576
Do you hear this? Fine.

568
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,113
Just to prove you wrong,
I will meet her.

569
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:42,083
Oh, it's done.

570
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:46,187
-Fine.
-Fine.

571
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,488
Fine!

572
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:51,225
See? She's fine.

573
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,427
She isn't fine.

574
00:24:53,561 --> 00:24:54,996
Do you know anything
about women?

575
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:56,998
I know that they need burritos.

576
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:08,109
I love my bi-weekly mani-pedis.

577
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:12,913
Well, tricks, I am off.

578
00:25:13,047 --> 00:25:16,283
Got my eyebrows waxed,
I got my Brazilian.

579
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:18,619
And let me just say,
I am so bare down there,

580
00:25:18,753 --> 00:25:20,187
I am turning myself on.

581
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:22,690
Drip, drip that WAP, bitch!

582
00:25:22,823 --> 00:25:24,225
Girl, you know it.

583
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:25,893
What? No pedi today?

584
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:28,429
-Oh!
-Uh, no.
I've been banned from pedis

585
00:25:28,562 --> 00:25:30,865
ever since
I kicked Lila in the eye.

586
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:34,969
Sorry. Here you go.

587
00:25:35,436 --> 00:25:36,303
Bye!

588
00:25:36,437 --> 00:25:37,371
Bye.

589
00:25:37,972 --> 00:25:39,407
What a cheap-ass bitch!

590
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,776
-That's Debby.
-Yeah.

591
00:25:42,743 --> 00:25:43,811
So, Diva, when do you leave?

592
00:25:43,944 --> 00:25:45,246
In two days, baby.

593
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:48,015
Damn, you've been working
nonstop, that's amazing.

594
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:51,318
Right? Who knew my vitiligo
would be a plus?

595
00:25:51,452 --> 00:25:54,288
It's like they're hiring
two Divas for the price of one.

596
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:56,190
Kanye and Kim.

597
00:25:56,323 --> 00:25:57,526
That's awesome.

598
00:25:58,259 --> 00:25:59,927
I think it's time for me
to get back to work.

599
00:26:00,061 --> 00:26:02,363
Honey, I told you,
you shouldn't have stopped.

600
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:04,498
I know, but Emma's older now.

601
00:26:04,632 --> 00:26:05,699
I think I'm ready.

602
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,170
Guess who's the photographer
for my next gig?

603
00:26:09,603 --> 00:26:11,472
-No!
-Yeah.

604
00:26:12,106 --> 00:26:14,575
I knew mentioning
Mr. The-one-that-got-away

605
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:16,545
would put a smile on your face.

606
00:26:16,677 --> 00:26:18,312
Okay, tell Samuel I said, "Hi."

607
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:20,681
-Come tell him, "Hi," yourself.
-No, I can't.

608
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:23,284
Oh, too busy
pretending to be divorced?

609
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:25,419
It's just an experiment, Diva.

610
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:26,887
I mean,
I know this sounds crazy,

611
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:28,823
but I need to know
who I can trust.

612
00:26:28,956 --> 00:26:30,991
Besides, it'll be over
in two hours.

613
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:34,762
Mama, just like
no two hands are the same,

614
00:26:34,895 --> 00:26:36,565
no two mans are the same.

615
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:39,433
Marco is not
your cheating ex-husband,

616
00:26:39,568 --> 00:26:41,969
and you could really screw
this up if you don't trust him.

617
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:48,642
No, no, no, no!
That's our acidic foot peel.

618
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:55,483
Kim! Kim!

619
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:01,523
The manicurist burned his hands.

620
00:27:01,655 --> 00:27:04,225
-Second-degree burns.
-Oh, shit.

621
00:27:04,358 --> 00:27:06,528
Those bi-racial hands
are his bread and butter.

622
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,296
-I know.
-That ought to set him back.

623
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,398
Well, they'll just give the job
to someone else,

624
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:13,400
but financially, he's set.

625
00:27:13,535 --> 00:27:14,702
He has insurance on those hands

626
00:27:14,835 --> 00:27:17,404
and the best doctors
working on them.

627
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:20,708
You can insure your body parts?

628
00:27:21,175 --> 00:27:22,076
Yep.

629
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:25,212
Should I insure my dick?

630
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:29,116
Why would you insure your dick?

631
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:32,587
I don't know. As crazy
as you've been acting recently,

632
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,589
what if you Lorena Bobbitt me?

633
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:40,694
Babe, I would never
chop your dick off.

634
00:27:40,828 --> 00:27:42,696
-Good.
-I'd kill you.

635
00:27:44,198 --> 00:27:45,132
Here we go.

636
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:49,737
Go have fun
on your "coffee date."

637
00:27:50,605 --> 00:27:52,373
-Love you.
-Love you.

638
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,675
Come on.

639
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:55,843
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay.
-Like that?

640
00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:57,745
Okay. All right.

641
00:27:58,312 --> 00:28:00,681
Okay, are you
getting me ready for my date?

642
00:28:00,814 --> 00:28:02,049
Swirling my scent on you.

643
00:28:02,183 --> 00:28:04,519
What--

644
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:11,225
I can't believe
you're making me do this.

645
00:28:18,265 --> 00:28:20,901
<i>Hi, Marco. God, you look great!</i>

646
00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:23,505
Coffee, biscotti,
what else do you want?

647
00:28:23,638 --> 00:28:24,939
Yeah.

648
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:30,711
Well, first of all,
I just want to say thank you
for reaching out, Tracey.

649
00:28:30,844 --> 00:28:34,014
It's, um, good to know
that we have friends
that we can count on.

650
00:28:34,148 --> 00:28:36,551
Oh, yeah, of course. Absolutely.

651
00:28:36,984 --> 00:28:37,918
So what happened?

652
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:41,155
You know, basic couple shit.

653
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:43,357
You know, I left
the cap off the toothpaste,

654
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,859
she left her, um,
hair in the drain.

655
00:28:45,993 --> 00:28:48,929
Oh, come on.
You can be honest with me.

656
00:28:49,063 --> 00:28:50,431
Was she a horrible housewife?

657
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:52,833
The house was always a mess.

658
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:54,335
- Jerk.
<i>- I knew it.</i>

659
00:28:54,468 --> 00:28:56,103
I just won a bet.

660
00:28:56,237 --> 00:28:57,738
- These bitches.
-  -<i>I knew</i> <i>it'd be an issue.</i>

661
00:28:57,871 --> 00:28:59,641
-You're old school.
You wanna come home...
-Mm. Mm.

662
00:28:59,773 --> 00:29:03,043
...to a clean house
and a home-cooked meal.

663
00:29:03,177 --> 00:29:05,614
-Yeah. Yeah.
-What else?

664
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:07,881
- She could be quite controlling, you know.
-  -Oh.

665
00:29:08,015 --> 00:29:10,518
Everything had to be
right in the calendar.

666
00:29:10,652 --> 00:29:13,354
-Even sex?
-Oh, yeah.

667
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:14,922
Oops. Oh my goodness,

668
00:29:15,055 --> 00:29:16,824
I'm so clumsy.
I'm always dropping some--

669
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:18,225
Oh, good one, Tracey,

670
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:20,160
the old,
"I just dropped my napkin."

671
00:29:20,294 --> 00:29:22,196
Don't fall for it, Marco.
Don't fall for it.

672
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:23,497
Yeah. Oh.

673
00:29:23,632 --> 00:29:25,165
-I'm sorry.
-Oh! Oh!

674
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:26,867
There you go.

675
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:29,336
Thank you.

676
00:29:33,474 --> 00:29:36,043
Hi, hon. How are you?
How's your hand?

677
00:29:36,176 --> 00:29:37,811
<i>Not good, baby girl.</i>

678
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:40,649
<i>I need you to do me a favor.</i>
<i>I need someone to cover me</i>

679
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:42,149
<i>for my shoot tomorrow.</i>

680
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:46,487
<i>It's all taken care of.</i>
<i>You just have to say, "Yes."</i>

681
00:29:46,621 --> 00:29:48,623
Yes! Oh my God, yes!

682
00:29:48,757 --> 00:29:50,858
<i>-I'll see if I can</i>
<i>step up to wish you luck.</i>
-But hey, uh, I'm in--

683
00:29:50,991 --> 00:29:53,294
I'm kind of in the middle
of something, all right?
C-- can I call you back

684
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:55,062
or you just send me
the details, please?

685
00:29:55,195 --> 00:29:57,097
<i>Sure thing, sugar.</i>
<i>I'll put you in contact</i>

686
00:29:57,231 --> 00:29:59,266
<i>-with Samuel's assistant.</i>
-Okay, thank you!

687
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,536
<i>Congrats, baby. Love you!</i>

688
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,771
Love you.

689
00:30:02,903 --> 00:30:06,240
<i>Oh. Ooh, this is hard.</i>

690
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:08,842
<i>Do you like it hard?</i>

691
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:11,245
<i>Absolutely. When you dip it in,</i>

692
00:30:11,378 --> 00:30:14,481
<i>- it becomes moist.</i>
- What the fuck!

693
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:16,383
Oh, hell no.

694
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:22,923
-Mm, that is good.
-Mm.

695
00:30:23,357 --> 00:30:26,293
-I guess a hard biscotti
is not the way to go.
-Mm.

696
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,263
Anyway, Tracey, what about you?

697
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:32,833
I mean, it's been three years
since the divorce?

698
00:30:32,966 --> 00:30:34,234
-Mm-hmm.
-How's the dating scene?

699
00:30:34,368 --> 00:30:38,205
It's pretty bleak,
if I'm honest.

700
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:42,711
You know? It's hard
to find a man, a good man,

701
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:43,911
especially when you have kids.

702
00:30:44,044 --> 00:30:44,978
-Yeah.
-Hey.

703
00:30:45,112 --> 00:30:46,213
-Oh! Oh!
-Oh!

704
00:30:46,347 --> 00:30:47,948
-Oh, sh--
-Oh, I got it.

705
00:30:48,082 --> 00:30:49,983
I got it.

706
00:30:50,117 --> 00:30:52,654
-I got it. Yeah, right there,
it's coming out.
-It's gonna come out? All right.

707
00:30:52,787 --> 00:30:54,922
-Yeah? O-- okay, I've got it.
-It's coming out,
yeah. Yeah, yeah.

708
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:56,890
-You've got to dab it.
-Okay, I'v-- I've got it.

709
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,992
-Good, good. All right,
okay, I've got it.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

710
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:01,328
-Yeah, that's good.
No, no, n-- Oh!
-Yeah, I-- I've g--

711
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:03,097
-That's good! That's good.
-Oh!

712
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,699
-Ye-- Oh.
-Oh my God, I'm so sorry,
I totally went

713
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,934
-autopilot Mommy on your ass.
-No, that's all right.

714
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:08,570
-I've gotta go anyway.
-I'm so sorry.

715
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,344
Okay.

716
00:31:19,714 --> 00:31:22,784
That was... that was weird.

717
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:24,885
I can't keep a clean house?

718
00:31:25,018 --> 00:31:25,986
You were listening to me?

719
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,354
Check your pockets.

720
00:31:28,823 --> 00:31:29,858
You don't trust me!

721
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,860
No, it was Tracy
I couldn't trust.

722
00:31:31,992 --> 00:31:33,628
Apparently,
I can't trust you either.

723
00:31:33,762 --> 00:31:35,663
I was making shit up, Alexis.

724
00:31:35,797 --> 00:31:37,030
I just told you the other night

725
00:31:37,164 --> 00:31:38,566
how hard it is
to keep up with a lie.

726
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,869
Why the hell was she trying
to grab your dick?

727
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:42,202
Oh my God.

728
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,873
I-- I dropped
my biscotti on my lap.

729
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:47,174
She went right into Mommy mode
to try to clean it up.

730
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:50,043
- Okay. Why didn't you
shut her down?
- I did shut it down!

731
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:53,648
Jesus Christ!
Man, why are you so insecure?

732
00:31:53,782 --> 00:31:55,149
Don't call me insecure!

733
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:57,451
You said you loved my calendars.

734
00:31:57,585 --> 00:31:59,119
I've had enough of this.

735
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:01,422
Oh, so you've had
enough of me? Okay.

736
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:04,726
I didn't say you, I said this!

737
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:26,548
You made one cup of coffee?

738
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:30,184
That's mature.

739
00:32:37,592 --> 00:32:40,360
So you're seeing
your ex-boyfriend today?

740
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,665
Don't be insecure.

741
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:44,833
Oh, I'm not.

742
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:46,734
I just think you're a hypocrite.

743
00:32:46,868 --> 00:32:49,269
Oh, we're name-calling now?

744
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:52,439
It's for a job.
I was gonna tell you yesterday,

745
00:32:52,574 --> 00:32:54,542
but you were too busy
on your date.

746
00:32:54,676 --> 00:32:55,743
Oh, my--

747
00:32:57,044 --> 00:32:58,412
That wasn't a date.

748
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,180
You made me go.

749
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:01,982
This is nuts!

750
00:33:03,016 --> 00:33:05,219
Look, during your date,

751
00:33:05,352 --> 00:33:07,187
Diva asked me
to step in for him.

752
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:10,424
I haven't worked in years,
and I didn't think
it was such a big deal

753
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:12,192
that Samuel would be there.

754
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:15,462
Oh, sure you didn't,
but that's okay.

755
00:33:15,597 --> 00:33:17,264
Go ahead. Do it.

756
00:33:17,397 --> 00:33:19,701
Unlike you, I trust you.

757
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:21,235
But this guy?

758
00:33:21,368 --> 00:33:25,607
Oh, this guy! He still
has feelings for you. Hmm!

759
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,843
Oh, I've seen all the likes
he's given on your social media.

760
00:33:28,977 --> 00:33:32,714
"Oh, you're looking great."
"Oh, married life suits you."

761
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:36,718
You're trolling him?
I haven't even talked to him
or seen him in years.

762
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:38,485
-Whatever.
-Whatever.

763
00:33:39,052 --> 00:33:41,689
By the way,
I'm going out tonight,
you don't need to wait up.

764
00:33:41,823 --> 00:33:44,692
Hey, go have dinner with him.
Whatever.

765
00:33:44,826 --> 00:33:46,794
I fucking trust you.

What the--

788
00:34:47,922 --> 00:34:49,524
Hey, Miss Beach.

789
00:34:49,657 --> 00:34:53,327
Hi, Marco.
And please, call me Barbie.

790
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,029
I didn't know you lived
in this neighborhood.

791
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:56,864
Actually, I don't, I...

792
00:34:57,364 --> 00:34:58,900
...ran a little further
than I usually do.

793
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:01,368
- Just trying
to let off some steam.

794
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:03,972
I understand, I bet
the divorce is taking a toll.

795
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:06,941
Yeah, right. The divorce.

796
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:10,645
I like to release sexual tension
by planting cacti.

797
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,347
That's an interesting cactus.

798
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,084
Hey, are you busy this evening?

799
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:17,852
Actually, I'm not.

800
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:19,587
Have you heard
of The Pool Party?

801
00:35:19,721 --> 00:35:22,624
-I went to one last week.
-I mean, The Pool Party.

802
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:25,459
Sure.
Are the kids gonna be there?

803
00:35:25,593 --> 00:35:29,063
My godd--
oh, you're so funny.

804
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,332
-Oh, wouldn't that be awful?
-Oh, yeah.

805
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:36,236
Ugh. Kids, the darn kids
you spent so much time with.

806
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,271
So I'll pick you up later?

807
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:40,975
Uh, let's just meet there.

808
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:44,912
And, um, should I wear
my bathing suit
or can I change there?

809
00:35:45,046 --> 00:35:46,848
Bathing suit!

810
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:48,716
You're so hilarious!

811
00:35:53,021 --> 00:35:54,822
Okay, uh, bye, Miss Beach.

812
00:35:54,956 --> 00:35:57,091
I'll text you the address.

813
00:35:57,224 --> 00:36:01,328
- Imagine being pampered
like this all the time.

814
00:36:01,461 --> 00:36:03,765
Oh my God,
I missed this for sure.

815
00:36:04,197 --> 00:36:06,466
I'm happy to hear it. But...

816
00:36:07,635 --> 00:36:08,970
...are you ready to see Samuel?

817
00:36:09,103 --> 00:36:12,339
What? Okay, there is
nothing there, I promise.

818
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:15,275
Honey, you and him had
some crazy chemistry.

819
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:16,911
And that's dangerous.

820
00:36:17,045 --> 00:36:20,114
Okay, Samuel and I were hot
for each other, but toxic.

821
00:36:20,247 --> 00:36:21,716
We were always
at each other's throats.

822
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:24,052
And the only reason
we lasted that long

823
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:25,687
was because of the make-up sex.

824
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,122
Well, just make sure
those embers are gone.

825
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:32,492
- We want you going back to work,
not back to being single.

826
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:37,165
They're ready for you,
try not to fuck this up.

827
00:36:40,935 --> 00:36:43,104
What the-- okay.

828
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:45,973
Don't worry about her.
She's pissed

829
00:36:46,107 --> 00:36:47,842
because she wanted this job.

830
00:36:48,442 --> 00:36:49,911
You watch your back around her.

831
00:36:50,712 --> 00:36:54,582
Oh, I'm so nervous,
I didn't even get a chance
to eat today, I'm starving.

832
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:57,284
Well, grab a snack
and knock them dead.

833
00:36:57,417 --> 00:36:58,619
I'll see you
on the flip side, baby.

834
00:36:58,753 --> 00:37:01,155
I've got an appointment
for some TLC

835
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:03,423
with Kim and Kanye.

836
00:37:03,558 --> 00:37:06,661
Okay.
Thank you so much.

837
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:08,863
Feel better.

838
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:13,300
Hell yeah, we're back, bitches.

839
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:16,771
Ooh. Hell yeah.

840
00:37:17,138 --> 00:37:18,438
Love crafty table.

841
00:37:18,973 --> 00:37:21,475
Hi, I missed you!

842
00:37:21,843 --> 00:37:24,011
Oh, fuck yeah. Come here.

843
00:37:25,747 --> 00:37:29,751
Oh, that's-- never mind, enjoy.

844
00:37:31,552 --> 00:37:34,321
I hate her,
with her big titties.

845
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,127
Mm!

846
00:37:41,996 --> 00:37:42,897
Mm!

847
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:49,170
Oh, fuck!

848
00:37:50,738 --> 00:37:51,706
Fuck!

849
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:11,025
-Allie? Allie,
Allie, Allie, Allie!
-Samuel!

850
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,894
-Hey.
-Oh my God!

851
00:38:13,594 --> 00:38:15,730
- How are you?
- How are you? Come here.

852
00:38:15,863 --> 00:38:17,330
-You look so beautiful.
-Oh, okay.

853
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:18,331
-Oh, okay.
-No, again!

854
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:19,700
Okay, Samuel, great.

855
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:21,636
You can't kiss me
on the mouth anymore.

856
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:24,471
-I'm a married woman.
-Oh, that is a nice rock.

857
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,508
-So, you're ready to go? Okay.
-Yep.

858
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:29,811
-Mm-hmm. Let's go. Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

859
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:33,247
What? Still feisty.

860
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,449
-Oh, you know me. Always.
-She's so feisty. I like it.

861
00:38:36,584 --> 00:38:38,553
-Yeah. Mm.
-No. I-- I missed that.

862
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:40,888
Actually, I haven't missed much.
I've been keeping up with you

863
00:38:41,022 --> 00:38:42,590
-on social media. Yeah!
-Really?

864
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:44,625
Because I don't know
anything about you.

865
00:38:44,759 --> 00:38:46,393
Other than you're
still not married.

866
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:47,929
Oh, burn.

867
00:38:48,395 --> 00:38:51,364
Well, honey,
you've ruined me for all women.

868
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:54,635
That's because I'm like a dog
on a fire hydrant, just...

869
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:58,239
just pissing all over you.

870
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,042
Thank you
for the image. Thank you.

871
00:39:01,175 --> 00:39:02,777
-Okay, let's get started. Yeah?
-Yeah.

872
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,045
Jasmine is gonna
be helping us out.

873
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:06,013
Oh, I think she's helped enough.

874
00:39:07,081 --> 00:39:08,683
- Okay. Alexis, take a seat.
- Yeah.

875
00:39:08,816 --> 00:39:10,117
Uh, Jasmine, will you place

876
00:39:10,251 --> 00:39:11,953
a few of those gummies
in her palm for me?

877
00:39:12,086 --> 00:39:15,122
Okay, Alexis, open up.
Place them right there.

878
00:39:15,256 --> 00:39:16,791
Beautiful. Beau--

879
00:39:16,924 --> 00:39:19,327
-Oh! Bouncy little fuckers.
-Okay, Jasmin--

880
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:21,262
-What happened?
-Jasmine, the whol--
the whole point,

881
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:22,763
Jasmine,
is to place them in her palm,

882
00:39:22,897 --> 00:39:24,999
make sure they stay, okay?
Let's try that.

883
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:27,702
Okay, let's do it again.
Let's go. Okay.

884
00:39:27,835 --> 00:39:29,804
-There you go.
All right, here we go.
-Mm-hmm.

885
00:39:29,937 --> 00:39:32,673
-Um.
-Give me hot. Roll the tips.

886
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:34,942
Yes, roll the tips.

887
00:39:35,076 --> 00:39:37,345
Now, open it up.
Open it up, open it up!

888
00:39:37,812 --> 00:39:40,514
Yes.
Give me a hyena.

889
00:39:40,648 --> 00:39:44,451
- Oh, yeah.
- Those fingertips are so sexy.

890
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:46,453
God, look at that.
So, Diva tells me

891
00:39:46,587 --> 00:39:49,724
that this is your first hand job
in eight years.

892
00:39:49,857 --> 00:39:53,060
Hand job?
Oh, you're so funny.

893
00:39:53,194 --> 00:39:54,795
I get it. Uh, no, actually,

894
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:57,131
I haven't given
a hand job since I was 17.

895
00:39:57,265 --> 00:39:59,466
Well, looks like
we'll have to change that.

896
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,102
I'm just kidding,
I-- I'm kidding.

897
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:02,837
Okay, you know what?
let's go to the chocolates.

898
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,538
Let's place one
on the index finger,

899
00:40:04,672 --> 00:40:06,874
on the tip, okay?

900
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:10,578
Gently place it there,
Jasmine. Thank you.

901
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:12,046
- Okay, Alexis.
- Hold still.

902
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:14,815
Hold it there. Okay. Come on.

903
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:17,285
That's gorgeous.
Come on. No, no.

904
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:21,088
- Open it up,
let me see it. Nice.

905
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:23,090
Give me a round.
Give me a round, for me.

906
00:40:23,224 --> 00:40:24,325
Come on. Come on.

907
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:32,133
Wait.

908
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,503
- Yes,
yes. Give it to me...

909
00:40:40,341 --> 00:40:43,778
I-- I'm melting.

910
00:40:44,345 --> 00:40:45,546
I'm melt--

911
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,949
Melt---

912
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:50,651
-I'm melting!
-Oh my God!

913
00:40:50,785 --> 00:40:52,420
-I'm melting!
-Jasmine, will you help her up?

914
00:40:52,553 --> 00:40:54,555
Come--

915
00:40:54,689 --> 00:40:57,325
Alexis, wha-- what's wrong?

916
00:40:57,457 --> 00:40:59,860
-She drugged me.
-Wait, wait, wait. What?

917
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:03,197
- Did you eat the edibles?
- "Did you eat
the edibles?"

918
00:41:03,331 --> 00:41:04,799
She gave them to me.

919
00:41:04,932 --> 00:41:07,535
Oh my God, look at your titties.

920
00:41:07,668 --> 00:41:09,737
They're so big!

921
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,606
That's a wrap. We got it.
We got it. Come on.
Jasmine, you can get up.

922
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,108
No. Come on, let's go.

923
00:41:14,241 --> 00:41:16,744
We got it. We got the shot.
You're such a pro.

924
00:41:16,877 --> 00:41:18,913
Yes! Okay.

925
00:41:19,046 --> 00:41:20,480
I want a hot dog.

926
00:41:21,215 --> 00:41:23,651
I will give you
a hot dog. Let's go.

927
00:41:38,532 --> 00:41:41,535
All right,
you're our last guest.
You can join them by the pool,

928
00:41:41,669 --> 00:41:43,070
they're about to begin
in five minutes.

929
00:41:43,204 --> 00:41:44,205
All right. Thank you.

930
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:57,351
You made it!

931
00:41:57,818 --> 00:42:00,554
Oh, and you brought
a bag of tricks.

932
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:02,223
Some people
usually wait a few times

933
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:03,758
before they dive right in.

934
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:05,893
But you're just getting
all in there, aren't you?

935
00:42:06,027 --> 00:42:07,728
Yeah, I'm a good swimmer.

936
00:42:07,862 --> 00:42:09,330
Look, I don't mean to brag,

937
00:42:09,463 --> 00:42:12,166
- but I was on the JV team
for four years.

938
00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:13,968
- What's up, buddy?
- Oh, God!

939
00:42:14,101 --> 00:42:16,270
Oh, man,
I knew you'd come around.

940
00:42:16,404 --> 00:42:18,439
-Wow. Oh!
-Yeah.

941
00:42:18,572 --> 00:42:20,741
- Hey.
- The whole gang is here.

942
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,543
-Hey, Marco.
-Okay.

943
00:42:22,676 --> 00:42:25,546
We've been coming
to these pool parties
for some time now.

944
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:29,617
Really? And you never thought
of inviting Alexis and me?

945
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:34,855
- Who doesn't love a good pool party, right?
-  -Yeah.

946
00:42:38,459 --> 00:42:39,660
Let's get wet.

947
00:42:39,794 --> 00:42:40,694
Let's get wet!

948
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:55,943
-Marquito!
-Ah, Jesus.

949
00:42:56,911 --> 00:42:58,579
You were invited?

950
00:42:58,712 --> 00:42:59,980
Sheesh.

951
00:43:00,114 --> 00:43:01,382
Technically, no.

952
00:43:01,516 --> 00:43:03,284
I saw your text from Miss Beach,

953
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:04,553
so I'm crashing.

954
00:43:04,685 --> 00:43:05,920
But I knew
you'd need a sidekick.

955
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:07,822
You saw my text? That's--

956
00:43:07,955 --> 00:43:11,292
Oh, and I'm gonna need a ride.
I took the bus.

957
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:14,061
You took the bus
wearing water shoes?

958
00:43:14,529 --> 00:43:16,931
It's for the environment, bro.
Don't judge.

959
00:43:18,799 --> 00:43:21,335
Hey, hey. I'm really glad

960
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:23,538
-that you're here.
-Why isn't anyone in the pool?

961
00:43:23,671 --> 00:43:25,005
That's what I mean.

962
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:28,577
Something's up. I, I, I just
can't put my finger on it.

963
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:33,914
But the fact that they never
invited Alexis and me
to one of these parties--

964
00:43:34,348 --> 00:43:35,816
Can I have your attention,
everybody?

965
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,052
I'd like to welcome everyone.

966
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:40,888
As always, we will go
over the short rules.

967
00:43:41,021 --> 00:43:43,057
I'm glad they're reminding
everyone not to run.

968
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,792
I fell on my head so hard once,

969
00:43:44,925 --> 00:43:46,694
I forgot how to wipe
my own ass for a week.

970
00:43:46,827 --> 00:43:48,662
The safe word is "papaya."

971
00:43:48,796 --> 00:43:51,165
- That's the original manager
of Guns N' Roses.

972
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:52,833
- No way.
- Yeah, bro.

973
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:54,201
I didn't know
he was in the bingo.

974
00:43:54,335 --> 00:43:55,604
...and unfortunately you can't

975
00:43:55,736 --> 00:43:57,572
come back ever again.

976
00:43:57,705 --> 00:43:58,873
Let's begin.

977
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:07,915
-Fourteen.
-Boom, yeah!

978
00:44:08,048 --> 00:44:09,717
Number one draft pick.

979
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,286
University of awesome, bro.

980
00:44:12,419 --> 00:44:14,155
These people
are so fucking organized.

981
00:44:14,288 --> 00:44:16,190
All of this
just to get in the pool?

982
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:18,893
I swear I'm gonna cannonball
on these fools when I get in.

983
00:44:19,026 --> 00:44:21,896
-I'm with you.
-I have an 18 and a 3.

984
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:23,797
Alright.

985
00:44:24,633 --> 00:44:25,766
We have a 26.

986
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,602
Yeah!

987
00:44:27,735 --> 00:44:30,004
- Thirty.
- That's you, bro.

988
00:44:30,137 --> 00:44:30,804
Oh shit.

989
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,742
Yeah. Alright.

990
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:36,377
Thank you. Thank you.

991
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:37,646
-Alright.
-Bye.

992
00:44:37,778 --> 00:44:40,014
Yeah, man.
See you in the pool, bro.

993
00:44:40,147 --> 00:44:41,315
Whoo-hoo!

994
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,319
Hey, 30.

995
00:44:45,452 --> 00:44:49,290
Hey, you are
in the bomb pop room.

996
00:44:49,423 --> 00:44:50,391
Follow me.

997
00:44:50,891 --> 00:44:51,959
Okay.

998
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:58,966
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

999
00:45:04,905 --> 00:45:06,473
What the fuck?

1000
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:18,852
The toys are always
the best part.

1001
00:45:19,286 --> 00:45:22,256
Oh, god. I'm sorry,
is, is this your room?

1002
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:25,092
It's our room.
Should we change now?

1003
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,395
Um, sure.

1004
00:45:29,598 --> 00:45:31,432
Oh, you mean now? Oh, oh, okay.

1005
00:45:31,566 --> 00:45:35,135
I'll, I'll just turn around
and give you some privacy.

1006
00:45:38,038 --> 00:45:39,206
Oh, ow. What?
What are you doing?

1007
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,309
You have small wrists.
I like that.

1008
00:45:42,443 --> 00:45:44,613
Maybe we can use it
to our advantage.

1009
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:45,779
What about the pool?

1010
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:48,449
Meh, meh, meh.

1011
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:51,986
Oh, my God. Oh.

1012
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:55,789
Shut up!

1013
00:46:01,563 --> 00:46:03,097
Oh, uh, sorry. I-- My bad.

1014
00:46:03,531 --> 00:46:06,000
No, honey,
you're in the right room.

1015
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:07,268
Close the door.

1016
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:10,237
Okay.

1017
00:46:14,576 --> 00:46:15,809
I, uh...

1018
00:46:17,646 --> 00:46:20,147
Are we supposed to do something?

1019
00:46:22,816 --> 00:46:24,952
-Are those for me?
-Hell yeah.

1020
00:46:25,085 --> 00:46:27,821
We have company joining us
in just a moment.

1021
00:46:30,491 --> 00:46:31,593
No way.

1022
00:46:32,126 --> 00:46:34,161
My dreams are finally
coming true.

1023
00:46:34,295 --> 00:46:36,130
I've always wanted to be
in a threesome.

1024
00:46:36,263 --> 00:46:37,766
Can I keep my water shoes on?

1025
00:46:37,898 --> 00:46:39,734
Whatever floats
your boat, darling.

1026
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:45,573
Hi, my name is Gunther.

1027
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:52,479
I have more toys.

1028
00:46:58,553 --> 00:47:00,387
A runner! How fun.

1029
00:47:07,696 --> 00:47:09,263
You didn't say papaya.

1030
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:18,005
-What?
-Papaya. Papaya.

1031
00:47:18,138 --> 00:47:20,240
Get these cuffs off me, please.

1032
00:47:20,709 --> 00:47:22,042
-Okay.
-Oh, my god.

1033
00:47:23,578 --> 00:47:24,945
Come on. Estanley.

1034
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,181
Estanley.

1035
00:47:27,314 --> 00:47:28,349
Oh, I'm sorry.

1036
00:47:28,482 --> 00:47:29,718
I'm sorry.

1037
00:47:34,922 --> 00:47:36,290
- Bob?
- Marco.

1038
00:47:36,423 --> 00:47:38,292
-Marco, here.
-No, I'm good.

1039
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:40,494
I'm good.

1040
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,998
Estanley.

1041
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:47,468
Estanley.

1042
00:47:51,573 --> 00:47:54,241
Estanley, Estanley.

1043
00:47:55,744 --> 00:47:58,879
I've never known
so much pleasure.

1044
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,349
Marco. Hey.
Awesome pool party, huh?

1045
00:48:02,483 --> 00:48:04,552
Uh, Estanley, we've gotta go.

1046
00:48:04,686 --> 00:48:06,353
Hell, no, bro.

1047
00:48:06,487 --> 00:48:09,123
I, I've waited for this moment
my whole life.

1048
00:48:09,256 --> 00:48:11,659
-I'm leaving.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1049
00:48:12,192 --> 00:48:14,995
Mistress Tanya,
may I please have a ride home?

1050
00:48:15,129 --> 00:48:16,664
I'll give you a ride, honey.

1051
00:48:16,798 --> 00:48:17,998
Thank you, Mistress Tanya.

1052
00:48:18,132 --> 00:48:18,932
You good, man?

1053
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:20,968
I'm so good, bro.

1054
00:48:22,136 --> 00:48:23,137
Good luck.

1055
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:24,639
Marco! Marco!

1056
00:48:25,372 --> 00:48:27,642
Don't forget about me, bro.

1057
00:48:29,143 --> 00:48:30,712
Marco! Marco!

1058
00:48:30,845 --> 00:48:31,979
- What?
- This is Gunther.

1059
00:48:32,112 --> 00:48:33,180
- Hi.
- Can he come over

1060
00:48:33,313 --> 00:48:35,449
-for pizza Friday night?
-Sure.

1061
00:48:36,518 --> 00:48:38,419
Okay, Estanley.

1062
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:44,358
One, two, or three balls?

1063
00:48:44,491 --> 00:48:47,027
Yes, please. Oh.

1064
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,602
So weird. I didn't think Gunther
would be the one to cry.

1065
00:48:54,736 --> 00:48:55,770
Yeah. What a little bitch.

1066
00:48:55,904 --> 00:48:57,271
I did all the work.

1067
00:48:57,705 --> 00:48:58,773
Get me three tacos.

1068
00:48:58,907 --> 00:49:00,107
Yes, ma'am.

1069
00:49:01,876 --> 00:49:03,410
Hamburger for Tomas!

1070
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,948
Ah-ha! I knew it.

1071
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:10,585
You carrot top motherfucker.

1072
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:12,687
What's this?

1073
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:13,721
Mm?

1074
00:49:14,455 --> 00:49:15,690
A burger?

1075
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:19,694
You're not a vegan.

1076
00:49:19,828 --> 00:49:20,728
You're a phony.

1077
00:49:20,862 --> 00:49:22,029
Fuck you, Estanley.

1078
00:49:22,162 --> 00:49:23,964
Get back here,
you son of a bitch!

1079
00:49:24,398 --> 00:49:26,433
What about my tacos, fool?

1080
00:49:26,568 --> 00:49:28,536
Oh, my god. That's my neighbor.

1081
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,170
Wait, wait. You know him?

1082
00:49:30,605 --> 00:49:31,606
Yeah.

1083
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:35,275
Now this, my darling,
is perfection.

1084
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:36,977
You've got ketchup,

1085
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:40,113
mustard, mayo, relish,
end to end.

1086
00:49:40,247 --> 00:49:42,517
All the flavor in every bite.

1087
00:49:42,951 --> 00:49:44,485
It looks like a mess.

1088
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:45,954
Do you want me to make yours?

1089
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:47,956
No, I'm good, Mr. Perfection.

1090
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:49,122
Actually, I'm really hungry.

1091
00:49:49,256 --> 00:49:50,792
Oh my god. That long dog

1092
00:49:50,925 --> 00:49:52,426
at the Gwen Stefani concert.

1093
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,294
That shit was perfection.
Am I right?

1094
00:49:54,428 --> 00:49:56,363
Great concert,
but I drank way too much.

1095
00:49:56,497 --> 00:49:58,999
My god. Shit.
This just reminds me.

1096
00:49:59,534 --> 00:50:01,335
-Do you remember
the morning after?
-Don't remind me.

1097
00:50:01,468 --> 00:50:03,470
I drove you home in the morning.

1098
00:50:03,872 --> 00:50:05,072
Wait, wait, wait.

1099
00:50:06,073 --> 00:50:07,809
You be me. I'll be you.

1100
00:50:07,942 --> 00:50:09,544
-No.
-Alexis, please.

1101
00:50:09,677 --> 00:50:10,778
No, you're awful.

1102
00:50:10,912 --> 00:50:13,146
-I am awful. Please.
-Fine.

1103
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,314
Thank you.

1104
00:50:14,682 --> 00:50:16,784
-You have to drive.
-Okay. I'm driving.

1105
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,890
- Baby, do you mind
pulling over--
- Okay, sure, sure.

1106
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,861
No.

1107
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:33,066
- I wiped my face
like that too? Okay.

1108
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,904
That was the most demure
throw-up I've ever seen
in my life.

1109
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:38,138
And then you just drove off
like nothing happened.

1110
00:50:38,272 --> 00:50:39,541
I didn't even notice
until I got home

1111
00:50:39,674 --> 00:50:41,275
there was puke
all on the side of my car.

1112
00:50:41,408 --> 00:50:42,844
I know. I'm so sorry.

1113
00:50:42,977 --> 00:50:46,514
I was such an idiot.
I think we just began dating.

1114
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:48,382
It took me a while to get you

1115
00:50:48,516 --> 00:50:51,051
to let your walls down
and just be you.

1116
00:50:51,953 --> 00:50:52,787
Puke and all.

1117
00:50:52,921 --> 00:50:54,288
But you did.

1118
00:50:55,823 --> 00:50:57,926
You know, sometimes I think
you're the last person

1119
00:50:58,058 --> 00:51:01,194
I really got to do that with.

1120
00:51:07,367 --> 00:51:08,703
That jacket looks good on you.

1121
00:51:08,836 --> 00:51:10,103
Thanks.

1122
00:51:11,138 --> 00:51:12,272
You think Jasmine is
gonna sue me?

1123
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:14,441
No. You--
she basically roofied you.

1124
00:51:14,809 --> 00:51:15,777
-Right.
-Yeah.

1125
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:17,512
We got what we needed anyway.

1126
00:51:17,645 --> 00:51:19,179
All I cared about was the fact

1127
00:51:19,313 --> 00:51:21,916
that you looked happy
and that you loosened up.

1128
00:51:22,382 --> 00:51:24,217
It reminded me of old times.

1129
00:51:24,819 --> 00:51:25,720
Yeah.

1130
00:51:27,555 --> 00:51:29,591
So...

1131
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:38,432
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.

1132
00:51:38,566 --> 00:51:39,901
-Oh, my god.
-It was just an instinct.

1133
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:41,435
-Are you kidding?
-It's just an old, old habit.

1134
00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:44,404
- I don't know.
- Old habit?

1135
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:46,908
-Let me take you
to the hospital!
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

1136
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:50,011
It's just, you know. No,
I don't want that. I'm gonna
leave it in for a moment.

1137
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,046
You like it?

1138
00:51:52,179 --> 00:51:53,781
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Oh.

1139
00:51:53,915 --> 00:51:56,017
-Shit. God.
You are a crazy fucker.
-Yeah.

1140
00:51:56,149 --> 00:51:57,451
I am. Oh, touch it.

1141
00:51:57,585 --> 00:51:59,887
- Touch it?
- Touch it.

1142
00:52:06,094 --> 00:52:07,260
Oh, this is getting weird.

1143
00:52:07,394 --> 00:52:08,963
Yes. It hasn't hit the bone yet.

1144
00:52:09,097 --> 00:52:10,230
Alright. Alright. So go deeper?

1145
00:53:10,024 --> 00:53:11,324
Hey.

1146
00:53:12,093 --> 00:53:13,695
Hey.

1147
00:53:14,896 --> 00:53:15,863
Do you hate me?

1148
00:53:16,998 --> 00:53:19,499
No. Never.

1149
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:21,903
It's the opposite.

1150
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,105
I love you.

1151
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:25,807
I love you too.

1152
00:53:27,141 --> 00:53:29,309
I took the post down last night.

1153
00:53:30,243 --> 00:53:32,212
-You were right.
-Whoa, whoa.

1154
00:53:32,345 --> 00:53:35,415
It was stupid and immature

1155
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,417
and I should have never done it.

1156
00:53:38,152 --> 00:53:39,620
That was a big mistake.

1157
00:53:40,955 --> 00:53:44,659
Can we just forget
it ever happened?

1158
00:53:45,126 --> 00:53:46,594
Yes!

1159
00:53:48,029 --> 00:53:49,329
I want nothing more.

1160
00:54:00,041 --> 00:54:00,975
So...

1161
00:54:02,577 --> 00:54:05,079
...you took it down
with no explanation?

1162
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:09,751
"For better or for worse,
we aren't divorcing.

1163
00:54:09,884 --> 00:54:12,754
I'm sorry to everyone
who worried about us.

1164
00:54:12,887 --> 00:54:13,888
We love you."

1165
00:54:14,254 --> 00:54:16,157
Aww, that's perfect.

1166
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:20,595
But could you repeat
one thing? Um...

1167
00:54:21,461 --> 00:54:24,932
-Yeah.
-Could you repeat the part

1168
00:54:25,066 --> 00:54:27,668
when you said the words
"You were right"?

1169
00:54:32,472 --> 00:54:33,708
Oh, you liked that, didn't you?

1170
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:37,779
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh, you were so right.

1171
00:54:37,912 --> 00:54:38,813
Again.

1172
00:54:41,381 --> 00:54:43,651
You were so...

1173
00:54:43,785 --> 00:54:45,019
- ...right.
- Yeah?

1174
00:54:47,588 --> 00:54:49,223
-All right then.
-Mm-hmm.

1175
00:54:49,356 --> 00:54:51,458
Mm-hmm.

1176
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:05,706
Oh, my god.

1177
00:55:07,675 --> 00:55:10,077
Oh, my god, babe,
I have some amazing news.

1178
00:55:10,745 --> 00:55:13,413
Babe, what's wrong?

1179
00:55:15,082 --> 00:55:16,316
Debby sent me this.

1180
00:55:18,586 --> 00:55:20,254
Okay. I, I can explain.

1181
00:55:20,822 --> 00:55:23,356
Did she send you the one
where I stabbed him in the leg

1182
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:24,992
with the pencil right after?

1183
00:55:26,961 --> 00:55:28,596
-You're unbelievable.
-Marco?

1184
00:55:28,729 --> 00:55:29,797
-No!
-Get off me!

1185
00:55:29,931 --> 00:55:30,531
Babe.

1186
00:55:33,935 --> 00:55:34,869
Bitch.

1187
00:55:37,004 --> 00:55:37,972
God.

1188
00:55:41,709 --> 00:55:44,377
I tried to tell you that
she's out of your league, bro.

1189
00:55:44,512 --> 00:55:48,583
Ugh! Fuck you, Estanley.

1190
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:51,619
Everybody is in my league, man.

1191
00:55:51,752 --> 00:55:54,922
Alright? I'm not short.
I'm not tall either.

1192
00:55:56,123 --> 00:55:57,457
I'm good-looking.

1193
00:55:58,526 --> 00:56:00,328
I've made something of myself.

1194
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:04,999
Listen, so is Alexis really sad?

1195
00:56:05,432 --> 00:56:06,567
She should be.

1196
00:56:07,134 --> 00:56:09,136
- I'm the best thing
she's ever had.

1197
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:13,440
Is she angry?
Like "I'm gonna have
a revenge fuck with some rando

1198
00:56:13,574 --> 00:56:15,509
to get back at that
motherfucker" angry?

1199
00:56:15,643 --> 00:56:17,410
Or, or, or is she angry

1200
00:56:17,545 --> 00:56:20,114
like, "You know what?
Fuck Marco.

1201
00:56:20,248 --> 00:56:21,682
I'm gonna blow all his friends

1202
00:56:21,816 --> 00:56:23,483
because I'm
an independent woman."

1203
00:56:23,618 --> 00:56:25,452
What? That's--

1204
00:56:25,586 --> 00:56:27,288
She kissed him.

1205
00:56:27,755 --> 00:56:29,190
Why would she be mad?

1206
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:33,393
Guys, guys.
What's with the questions?

1207
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:35,863
We're just trying to figure out

1208
00:56:35,997 --> 00:56:39,100
if it's a good time
to ask her out now

1209
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:40,301
or just wait a little bit.

1210
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:41,769
You're cool with now?

1211
00:56:42,303 --> 00:56:43,738
Are you fucking kidding me?

1212
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:45,773
-God!
-You two are supposed to be

1213
00:56:45,907 --> 00:56:46,974
on my side!

1214
00:56:47,108 --> 00:56:48,276
-Fucking son of a...
-Jesus.

1215
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:49,977
-Calm down, man.
-...bitch.

1216
00:56:50,111 --> 00:56:52,580
-This is a brand new shirt,
you motherfucker.
-Jesus.

1217
00:56:52,713 --> 00:56:54,615
-Christ.
-Goddammit.

1218
00:56:55,016 --> 00:56:56,150
Alright.

1219
00:56:57,184 --> 00:56:59,287
You know what? The way I see it,

1220
00:56:59,419 --> 00:57:01,355
you must remember this.

1221
00:57:01,789 --> 00:57:03,357
A kiss is just a kiss.

1222
00:57:03,758 --> 00:57:07,061
A fly is just a fly. It--

1223
00:57:07,427 --> 00:57:10,097
Ah, fuck. How, how does it go?

1224
00:57:10,231 --> 00:57:11,431
The fuck are you saying?

1225
00:57:11,899 --> 00:57:16,270
Well, what I'm saying is
once you love her screw,

1226
00:57:16,771 --> 00:57:18,839
they still say "I love you."

1227
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:21,075
And that's the shit, man.

1228
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:23,010
That's totally the shit.

1229
00:57:23,411 --> 00:57:25,112
That's the shit.

1230
00:57:25,478 --> 00:57:28,749
I love her. I love her.

1231
00:57:31,953 --> 00:57:33,287
He's passed out.

1232
00:57:34,388 --> 00:57:38,192
-Let's sharpie his face
and his balls.
-Yeah.

1233
00:57:38,326 --> 00:57:40,695
- Did you bring
the sharpie?

1234
00:57:40,828 --> 00:57:41,696
Fuck.

1235
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:43,064
Fuck.

1236
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:48,803
Save me. Save me.

1237
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:52,773
I'm the king. I'm the king.

1238
00:57:52,907 --> 00:57:56,744
Oh, god. Oh, god.
Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god.

1239
00:57:59,213 --> 00:58:00,114
No.

1240
00:58:13,294 --> 00:58:14,762
Coffee like you like it.

1241
00:58:16,496 --> 00:58:17,965
How did you know I was here?

1242
00:58:18,766 --> 00:58:21,268
Estanley ordered pizza
from our pizza account.

1243
00:58:22,536 --> 00:58:24,505
Babe, I'm really sorry.

1244
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:28,642
Samuel kissed me, but I swear
I didn't kiss him back.

1245
00:58:29,443 --> 00:58:30,611
You know what, Alexis?

1246
00:58:31,278 --> 00:58:33,714
I warned you that something
like this would happen.

1247
00:58:33,848 --> 00:58:35,016
But you ignored me.

1248
00:58:35,383 --> 00:58:37,385
So this is all your fault.

1249
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:40,955
-I know.
-The divorce baiting,
sending me on a coffee date,

1250
00:58:41,088 --> 00:58:43,891
and then I get violated
at a pool party.

1251
00:58:44,392 --> 00:58:45,793
-What?
-Never mind.

1252
00:58:45,926 --> 00:58:48,162
You have trust issues, Alexis.

1253
00:58:48,295 --> 00:58:51,665
Your walls are up with me
and they won't come down.

1254
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:54,135
And I feel that
that will never happen.

1255
00:58:54,268 --> 00:58:58,439
But I can handle knowing
that they may never come down,

1256
00:58:58,572 --> 00:59:00,975
but you not trusting me

1257
00:59:01,108 --> 00:59:04,011
and then you go out
and you kiss your ex.

1258
00:59:04,145 --> 00:59:05,112
Wow.

1259
00:59:10,785 --> 00:59:12,119
I need time alone.

1260
00:59:12,787 --> 00:59:13,888
Wait, babe.

1261
00:59:18,527 --> 00:59:20,261
Man, is he pissed at you.

1262
00:59:28,102 --> 00:59:29,003
Come in.

1263
00:59:30,337 --> 00:59:31,906
Hi. You busy?

1264
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:34,909
Oh, hey, Debs. Come in.

1265
00:59:35,676 --> 00:59:36,877
Take a seat.

1266
00:59:40,714 --> 00:59:41,882
You know, I...

1267
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:44,418
I just wanted to check on you,
so I brought you lunch.

1268
00:59:45,252 --> 00:59:49,356
Oh, wow.
That was very nice of you.

1269
00:59:50,724 --> 00:59:51,692
Shit, I guess it is lunch.

1270
00:59:51,826 --> 00:59:54,428
Yeah. Ahi Poke.

1271
00:59:54,829 --> 00:59:57,231
Are you serious?
That is my favorite.

1272
00:59:57,364 --> 00:59:58,432
You've always got my back.

1273
00:59:58,567 --> 00:59:59,867
It wasn't that hard, honestly.

1274
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,636
You're posting
lots and lots of poke pics.

1275
01:00:03,003 --> 01:00:04,905
Poke pics.

1276
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:05,906
Right.

1277
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:06,941
Hey.

1278
01:00:08,008 --> 01:00:09,511
-About the video...
-Oh.

1279
01:00:09,643 --> 01:00:13,582
...I just want you to know
I was absolutely tortured

1280
01:00:13,714 --> 01:00:14,882
all night about it.

1281
01:00:15,316 --> 01:00:17,451
But I thought if it were me,
I would want to know.

1282
01:00:17,586 --> 01:00:19,386
So I had to send it.

1283
01:00:19,521 --> 01:00:20,821
Hm. I get it. I get it.

1284
01:00:20,955 --> 01:00:22,756
Well, you did the right thing.
Thank you.

1285
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:24,658
And I'm sorry that you were
put through that.

1286
01:00:24,792 --> 01:00:26,694
And I'm sure it wasn't
an easy decision.

1287
01:00:26,827 --> 01:00:29,663
So thank you again.

1288
01:00:29,797 --> 01:00:31,365
-Okay.
-Right.

1289
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,870
Oh, by any chance,
is there any sriracha?

1290
01:00:36,937 --> 01:00:40,307
Oh, uh, no.

1291
01:00:40,441 --> 01:00:41,709
That's okay. It's okay.

1292
01:00:41,842 --> 01:00:43,277
I always have extra
in the drawer here.

1293
01:00:49,483 --> 01:00:54,021
Ah, found some sriracha-- Jesus.

1294
01:00:54,922 --> 01:00:57,224
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Debby.

1295
01:00:58,092 --> 01:00:59,860
Debby, what are you doing?

1296
01:00:59,994 --> 01:01:01,962
Hi, Becky.

1297
01:01:02,096 --> 01:01:03,964
Oh, you look so great today.

1298
01:01:04,098 --> 01:01:05,299
Is he in?

1299
01:01:05,733 --> 01:01:07,768
Oh, yes, Mrs. Laguna.

1300
01:01:07,902 --> 01:01:09,538
I'm sure he'll be happy
to see you.

1301
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:12,873
Oh shit. Oh shit.
Come on. Come on.

1302
01:01:13,007 --> 01:01:14,408
Can you please hold his calls

1303
01:01:14,543 --> 01:01:16,110
and not let anyone disturb us?

1304
01:01:16,243 --> 01:01:18,212
-Sure thing.
-Thank you.

1305
01:01:29,423 --> 01:01:30,824
Hi, baby.

1306
01:01:30,958 --> 01:01:33,160
Hi. Oh, good.

1307
01:01:33,294 --> 01:01:34,695
You're closer to forgiving me.

1308
01:01:34,828 --> 01:01:35,796
Oh, we're good, baby.

1309
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:36,931
Yeah.

1310
01:01:37,064 --> 01:01:38,600
Oh, we're good.

1311
01:01:38,732 --> 01:01:40,635
I see you have lunch.

1312
01:01:40,768 --> 01:01:45,339
Awesome. Because
I brought you dessert.

1313
01:01:46,173 --> 01:01:48,042
Oh, wow.

1314
01:01:48,543 --> 01:01:49,443
Wow.

1315
01:01:50,144 --> 01:01:52,681
I know you've been wanting me

1316
01:01:52,813 --> 01:01:54,848
to give you a little show.

1317
01:01:54,982 --> 01:01:56,685
Stay right there, baby.
Right there.

1318
01:01:56,817 --> 01:01:59,053
- I just--
I want to take it all in.

1319
01:01:59,186 --> 01:02:01,188
I want to look at you
for a moment.

1320
01:02:02,624 --> 01:02:03,525
Hey, girl.

1321
01:02:05,627 --> 01:02:08,062
Alexis, nothing happened.

1322
01:02:08,195 --> 01:02:11,498
Debby, tell her
I didn't do anything.

1323
01:02:13,267 --> 01:02:15,869
Oh shit. I didn't do anything.

1324
01:02:20,307 --> 01:02:21,208
Debby.

1325
01:02:21,643 --> 01:02:23,811
Why? Why?

1326
01:02:37,925 --> 01:02:39,760
Baby, what are you doing?

1327
01:02:40,794 --> 01:02:42,162
I knew it.

1328
01:02:42,296 --> 01:02:42,997
Knew what?

1329
01:02:44,064 --> 01:02:46,333
When your ex-wife's friends
reached out to you
after your divorce,

1330
01:02:46,467 --> 01:02:48,168
you could have said no,
but you didn't.

1331
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:51,506
There are plenty of women
who would have slept with you.

1332
01:02:52,106 --> 01:02:53,774
Were you secretly
lusting after them

1333
01:02:53,907 --> 01:02:55,042
while you were married?

1334
01:02:55,175 --> 01:02:57,344
Baby, please stop doing this.

1335
01:02:57,746 --> 01:02:59,547
Stop doing this.

1336
01:03:01,248 --> 01:03:03,050
This is so messed up, Marco.

1337
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:05,786
You asked me
to let my guard down.

1338
01:03:05,919 --> 01:03:07,955
You set us up for disaster.

1339
01:03:08,523 --> 01:03:10,725
You've always had
one foot out the door.

1340
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:12,960
You have never let me in.

1341
01:03:13,093 --> 01:03:14,562
And this whole
divorce bait thing,

1342
01:03:14,696 --> 01:03:18,265
it wasn't that you just
couldn't trust your friends.

1343
01:03:19,066 --> 01:03:22,604
You couldn't trust me.
You never have.

1344
01:03:25,205 --> 01:03:26,373
So this is my fault?

1345
01:03:26,508 --> 01:03:27,908
-I didn't say that.
-I'm leaving.

1346
01:03:28,042 --> 01:03:29,376
I-- whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

1347
01:03:29,511 --> 01:03:33,414
This is ridiculous.
We're married, baby.

1348
01:03:37,151 --> 01:03:38,485
Diva still can't work,

1349
01:03:39,086 --> 01:03:41,322
and the company
really loved what I did.

1350
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:43,157
They offered me a campaign.

1351
01:03:44,358 --> 01:03:46,661
I've already worked it out
with Emma's dad.

1352
01:03:46,795 --> 01:03:48,195
I'll be gone for three weeks.

1353
01:03:50,765 --> 01:03:54,068
Well, I'm so glad
that you worked this all out.

1354
01:03:54,569 --> 01:03:57,004
Uh, let me guess, is your ex
going to be there?

1355
01:03:57,739 --> 01:03:59,808
I shut that down, Marco.
He's not even an issue.

1356
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:03,177
Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa.
You're gonna give all this up
for that jerk?

1357
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:06,313
-Oh, stop being insecure.
-I'm not insecure.

1358
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:08,182
That fucker ain't
got shit on me.

1359
01:04:08,315 --> 01:04:11,452
Oh yeah. Well,
at least he's never hurt me.

1360
01:04:14,254 --> 01:04:16,056
Neither have I, Alexis.

1361
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,095
Fuck.

1362
01:04:53,093 --> 01:04:55,963
<i>Hey, it's Alexis.</i>
<i>You know what to do.</i>

1363
01:04:59,032 --> 01:05:00,735
Where are you, Alexis?

1364
01:05:00,869 --> 01:05:02,503
Why you do this all the time?

1365
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,579
Marco.

1366
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,749
You shouldn't leave
your back door open.

1367
01:05:14,883 --> 01:05:16,183
Weirdos can just walk right in.

1368
01:05:16,316 --> 01:05:19,086
Present company not excluded.

1369
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:23,390
Marco. This is a mantervention.

1370
01:05:24,526 --> 01:05:26,728
-A what?
-We're intervening
on your hall pass

1371
01:05:26,861 --> 01:05:28,495
because we know
you're gonna fuck this up.

1372
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:29,564
Take notes.

1373
01:05:30,063 --> 01:05:33,000
I-- I'm not
on a hall pass, guys.

1374
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:34,935
Alright?
I don't want to see other women.

1375
01:05:35,436 --> 01:05:36,937
This is
every married man's dream.

1376
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:39,006
Guys, this isn't a breakup.

1377
01:05:39,373 --> 01:05:41,576
You don't think she's out there
banging that stallion?

1378
01:05:41,709 --> 01:05:44,211
-I do.
-I wouldn't call him
a stallion.

1379
01:05:44,344 --> 01:05:46,213
While you sit here moping,

1380
01:05:46,346 --> 01:05:49,483
she's out there
riding him like a bull.

1381
01:05:49,617 --> 01:05:51,586
I bet he's pulling her hair.

1382
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:54,455
-"Ah, Pull my hair."
-All of her hair.

1383
01:05:54,589 --> 01:05:56,791
-"Pull my hair, baby."
-Doing the stuff

1384
01:05:56,925 --> 01:05:58,927
you won't even dream of doing.

1385
01:05:59,059 --> 01:06:01,128
-Fuck stuff.
-All the--

1386
01:06:01,261 --> 01:06:02,429
Jesus, Bob.

1387
01:06:02,564 --> 01:06:03,997
What the hell's
your problem, man?

1388
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:05,733
We're just trying
to help you get laid

1389
01:06:05,867 --> 01:06:08,969
before that window of
opportunity closes on you, man.

1390
01:06:09,102 --> 01:06:11,371
Shrinking and shrinking
and shrinking.

1391
01:06:11,506 --> 01:06:14,041
You gotta dive through
before it closes.

1392
01:06:14,174 --> 01:06:15,409
I don't want to get laid.

1393
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,814
I don't think he does.

1394
01:06:20,615 --> 01:06:23,585
The best part is,
you can do it all

1395
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:26,253
from the comfort
of your lumpy-ass couch.

1396
01:06:26,386 --> 01:06:27,589
What are you talking about?

1397
01:06:27,722 --> 01:06:29,557
Virtual dating, bro.

1398
01:06:29,691 --> 01:06:32,092
It's what you always said
you wish you got to do.

1399
01:06:32,226 --> 01:06:34,127
You don't even
got to touch a girl,

1400
01:06:34,261 --> 01:06:36,096
so you can do
all kinds of kinky stuff,

1401
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:38,432
completely disease free.

1402
01:06:39,099 --> 01:06:40,501
Oh, wow, Bob.

1403
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:43,003
-Mm.
-So you're saying
I can look at naked girls

1404
01:06:43,136 --> 01:06:46,273
-on my computer screen
without even touching them?
-Mm.

1405
01:06:46,774 --> 01:06:48,943
Man, I think
that's called jerking off.

1406
01:06:49,376 --> 01:06:52,079
-Yeah.
-It's a revolution in dating.

1407
01:06:52,212 --> 01:06:55,148
Oh, I remember my first
FaceTime fuck.

1408
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:59,152
She had me do things that no one
else has ever made me do again.

1409
01:06:59,286 --> 01:07:00,855
Like what? Go on a real date?

1410
01:07:00,989 --> 01:07:02,957
No, like call her repeatedly

1411
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:04,458
while her phone was on vibrate.

1412
01:07:04,926 --> 01:07:07,394
She wrapped that phone up
and made it disappear.

1413
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:09,564
Oh, I had that bitch
on speed dial.

1414
01:07:09,697 --> 01:07:13,300
I'd call, stop, call, stop,

1415
01:07:13,433 --> 01:07:16,571
call, stop!

1416
01:07:16,971 --> 01:07:20,240
We're sorry. Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.

1417
01:07:20,374 --> 01:07:22,877
-Mm.
-Mm. Sounds magical.

1418
01:07:23,011 --> 01:07:25,013
Now, there are some things
you might have forgotten

1419
01:07:25,145 --> 01:07:27,481
since you're always jumping
from one marriage
directly into another.

1420
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:30,217
I, I'd tell you to fuck off
if that weren't true.

1421
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:33,220
You gotta remember,
the hotter that chick,
the crazier she's gonna be.

1422
01:07:33,353 --> 01:07:35,389
Come on, guys. This is bullshit.

1423
01:07:35,823 --> 01:07:39,092
Alexis is hot,
but she's not crazy.

1424
01:07:39,527 --> 01:07:41,128
She's just really insecure.

1425
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:43,965
And she makes up things
in her mind

1426
01:07:44,331 --> 01:07:48,168
about people
that aren't true, and, um...

1427
01:07:49,336 --> 01:07:50,470
Shit, she's crazy.

1428
01:07:51,973 --> 01:07:53,240
- Go on.
- Okay.

1429
01:07:53,373 --> 01:07:55,743
We've taken the liberty

1430
01:07:55,877 --> 01:08:01,081
of creating you your very own
online dating profile.

1431
01:08:01,214 --> 01:08:03,718
What? That's my computer, man.
I've been looking
all over for it.

1432
01:08:03,851 --> 01:08:05,620
I took it off
your nightstand this morning.

1433
01:08:05,753 --> 01:08:08,488
By the way,
he is really an ugly sleeper.

1434
01:08:08,623 --> 01:08:10,692
Add that to the list. No
sleepovers after getting laid.

1435
01:08:10,825 --> 01:08:15,429
- No, no, no.
 -But nonetheless, you are getting a ton of hits.

1436
01:08:15,563 --> 01:08:17,097
- I am?
- Hell yeah, bro.

1437
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:18,666
You're a successful divorcée

1438
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,467
who looks like one
of those high school teachers

1439
01:08:20,602 --> 01:08:22,269
who bangs all his students.

1440
01:08:22,402 --> 01:08:24,706
You're every woman's dream.

1441
01:08:26,674 --> 01:08:27,575
Yeah.

1442
01:08:28,141 --> 01:08:29,010
Sure.

1443
01:08:29,577 --> 01:08:31,779
All right. All right.

1444
01:08:32,379 --> 01:08:35,049
Heck, I'll try it.
But just not right now.

1445
01:08:35,415 --> 01:08:36,350
-All right?
-Okay.

1446
01:08:36,483 --> 01:08:37,652
-Yeah, all right.
-Yeah.

1447
01:08:37,785 --> 01:08:39,020
You'll see.
This is good for you.

1448
01:08:39,152 --> 01:08:40,320
You know, stress builds up

1449
01:08:40,454 --> 01:08:41,623
-in a man's nut sack.
-Yeah. Okay.

1450
01:08:41,756 --> 01:08:43,390
It has to just get out.

1451
01:08:43,524 --> 01:08:44,892
- Oh, great.
Thanks, doctor.
- Wait.

1452
01:08:45,026 --> 01:08:46,861
-Where are you going?
-You gonna finish this?

1453
01:08:47,962 --> 01:08:49,496
First my laptop, now my pizza?

1454
01:08:50,364 --> 01:08:51,498
You got anything else?

1455
01:08:52,232 --> 01:08:53,534
Get out of here.

1456
01:09:27,602 --> 01:09:30,237
Hey. Is the van not here yet?

1457
01:09:30,938 --> 01:09:32,372
Uh, nope.

1458
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:33,941
Oh.

1459
01:09:35,977 --> 01:09:37,779
Look, uh, you're doing
a great job.

1460
01:09:38,546 --> 01:09:40,815
It's like riding a bike.
You never forget.

1461
01:09:40,948 --> 01:09:43,283
Yeah, but
I don't know how to ride a bike.

1462
01:09:43,885 --> 01:09:46,386
-First time I tried,
I broke my leg.
-How did I not know

1463
01:09:46,521 --> 01:09:47,855
that you didn't know
how to ride a bike?

1464
01:09:47,989 --> 01:09:49,057
I don't know.

1465
01:09:49,724 --> 01:09:51,893
Okay, you know what,
this is my new mission.

1466
01:09:52,026 --> 01:09:53,828
But first...

1467
01:09:55,495 --> 01:09:56,864
...I have something.
Give-- Give me a second.

1468
01:09:56,998 --> 01:09:59,133
- Okay? Wait for it.
- What?

1469
01:09:59,266 --> 01:10:01,936
You can trust Samuel.

1470
01:10:05,006 --> 01:10:06,140
Look, I'm not a total jerk.

1471
01:10:06,774 --> 01:10:08,810
Little bit of a jerk.
Not a total jerk.

1472
01:10:08,943 --> 01:10:09,911
I saw that you were sad.

1473
01:10:11,546 --> 01:10:14,048
And when you were sad,

1474
01:10:14,182 --> 01:10:16,249
when we were together, we...

1475
01:10:17,652 --> 01:10:20,855
...used to have
the most amazing makeup sex.

1476
01:10:20,988 --> 01:10:23,124
Okay, but not anymore.

1477
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:31,364
But dancing used
to make you smile too.

1478
01:10:35,903 --> 01:10:36,804
May I?

1479
01:10:39,707 --> 01:10:42,375
- Come on.
- Okay.

1480
01:11:11,606 --> 01:11:13,508
- It's the van.
- Oh.

1481
01:11:13,641 --> 01:11:15,375
-Good.
-Yeah. All right. Um...

1482
01:11:15,843 --> 01:11:18,079
Uh, I'm gonna get my things.
All right.

1483
01:11:25,485 --> 01:11:26,486
Oh, shit.

1484
01:11:26,888 --> 01:11:28,421
How did you guys get in here?

1485
01:11:28,556 --> 01:11:29,924
Told you to lock your door.

1486
01:11:30,057 --> 01:11:31,959
-Marco, in just a moment...
-Hmm.

1487
01:11:32,093 --> 01:11:34,195
...you will begin
your virtual sex life.

1488
01:11:34,662 --> 01:11:36,998
You have a real fake date
with Cherry.

1489
01:11:37,698 --> 01:11:38,966
Wait, you mean right now?

1490
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,234
-Now or never.
-Yeah.

1491
01:11:40,367 --> 01:11:41,536
- Later.
- Good luck, bro.

1492
01:11:41,669 --> 01:11:42,837
Wait, you two.
What are you doing?

1493
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,238
I don't know
who the hell is this.

1494
01:11:44,371 --> 01:11:45,006
Get it.

1495
01:11:45,139 --> 01:11:46,240
What the--

1496
01:11:46,373 --> 01:11:47,608
<i>Hello?</i>

1497
01:11:48,176 --> 01:11:49,076
I'm here.

1498
01:11:49,544 --> 01:11:51,311
-Hey.
<i>-Marco?</i>

1499
01:11:51,444 --> 01:11:53,114
Uh, Cherry.

1500
01:11:53,247 --> 01:11:55,448
<i>- Yeah, that's me.</i>
- Hmm.

1501
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:59,187
<i>You look way better "in person."</i>

1502
01:12:01,454 --> 01:12:04,457
-Thank you.
-You-- You're very pretty.

1503
01:12:04,592 --> 01:12:07,427
<i>Oh, handsome and sweet.</i>

1504
01:12:07,562 --> 01:12:09,864
<i>Check and check.</i>

1505
01:12:10,397 --> 01:12:11,732
Oh, you have a checklist.

1506
01:12:11,866 --> 01:12:13,234
<i>Absolutely.</i>

1507
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:16,170
Well, this is
my first virtual date.

1508
01:12:16,304 --> 01:12:17,738
<i>-No way.</i>
-Hmm.

1509
01:12:17,872 --> 01:12:20,508
<i>Cherry's popping your cherry.</i>

1510
01:12:22,342 --> 01:12:24,178
<i>Hey, do you wanna play a game?</i>

1511
01:12:24,312 --> 01:12:25,313
Sure. What game?

1512
01:12:25,445 --> 01:12:28,249
<i>Strip Two Truths and a Lie.</i>

1513
01:12:28,381 --> 01:12:29,449
Okay, got it.

1514
01:12:29,584 --> 01:12:31,586
<i>I'll guess first.</i>

1515
01:12:31,719 --> 01:12:35,488
Let's see.
I've traveled to Japan.

1516
01:12:35,623 --> 01:12:38,125
I've traveled to Amsterdam.

1517
01:12:38,559 --> 01:12:40,761
And I've traveled to Spain.

1518
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:44,832
<i>I think you've traveled</i>
<i>to Spain and Amsterdam.</i>

1519
01:12:44,966 --> 01:12:48,202
Wrong. I've always wanted
to travel to Amsterdam.

1520
01:12:48,336 --> 01:12:50,705
<i>Okay. Well, here I go.</i>

1521
01:12:50,838 --> 01:12:53,406
Whoa.

1522
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:55,643
-Geez.
<i>-My turn.</i>

1523
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:57,578
<i>I play guitar.</i>

1524
01:12:57,712 --> 01:13:00,147
<i>I play with dolls.</i>

1525
01:13:00,281 --> 01:13:01,949
<i>I play with myself.</i>

1526
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:06,554
Um, I'm gonna go
with the guitar and yourself.

1527
01:13:06,687 --> 01:13:09,056
<i>Wrong!</i>

1528
01:13:11,626 --> 01:13:15,263
<i>Say hi to James and Ann.</i>

1529
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:18,366
Oh, that's... interesting.

1530
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,968
Oh, you're serious.
You want me....

1531
01:13:21,501 --> 01:13:22,837
Hi, James. Hi, Ann.

1532
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:25,773
<i>You lose, Marco.</i>

1533
01:13:25,907 --> 01:13:28,175
<i>Take something off.</i>

1534
01:13:31,145 --> 01:13:33,480
<i>Oh, nice pecs.</i>

1535
01:13:34,215 --> 01:13:36,483
<i>Are you a dirty boy, Marco?</i>

1536
01:13:36,617 --> 01:13:38,119
Excuse me? Cherry?

1537
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:39,520
<i>James is talking to you, Marco.</i>

1538
01:13:39,654 --> 01:13:40,988
<i>Aren't you going to answer him?</i>

1539
01:13:41,122 --> 01:13:42,890
Oh, yes, James.

1540
01:13:43,024 --> 01:13:46,227
I... Okay.
Oh, my....

1541
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,561
Li-- Listen, uh, Cherry.

1542
01:13:47,695 --> 01:13:49,830
You seem really nice, but this--

1543
01:13:49,964 --> 01:13:52,199
<i>-Rub your nipples for me.</i>
-What?

1544
01:13:52,867 --> 01:13:55,336
No, I don't.
Look-- You know what?

1545
01:13:55,468 --> 01:13:56,837
This was fun but I'm gonna--

1546
01:13:56,971 --> 01:14:01,208
<i>James wants to go</i>
<i>into the deep cave.</i>

1547
01:14:01,342 --> 01:14:02,843
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

1548
01:14:02,977 --> 01:14:05,846
<i>Switch to his wet suit.</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

1549
01:14:07,615 --> 01:14:08,950
<i>Oh, imagine this was your face</i>

1550
01:14:09,083 --> 01:14:10,751
<i>and it was going</i>
<i>into my deep cave.</i>

1551
01:14:10,885 --> 01:14:14,255
-Your what?
<i>-Here he goes,</i>

1552
01:14:14,388 --> 01:14:17,692
<i>spelunking into my deep cavern.</i>

1553
01:14:17,825 --> 01:14:19,193
- <i>Oh.</i>
- Oh, my God.

1554
01:14:19,327 --> 01:14:23,230
<i>It's so dark in here and humid.</i>

1555
01:14:23,364 --> 01:14:28,002
Um, listen, listen,
I, I haven't spelunked anyone
but my wife in four years

1556
01:14:28,135 --> 01:14:30,338
-and I just, I think I gotta go.
<i>-What?</i>

1557
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:31,806
<i>You said you were divorced.</i>

1558
01:14:31,939 --> 01:14:34,642
Yes. From my ex-wife.
But my new wife,

1559
01:14:34,775 --> 01:14:36,644
I mean, my,
my current wife and I...

1560
01:14:36,777 --> 01:14:38,579
- <i>Cherry!</i>
- ...we're going--

1561
01:14:38,713 --> 01:14:41,148
<i>Cherry! Are you in there again?</i>

1562
01:14:41,782 --> 01:14:43,684
<i>-Dinner's ready.</i>
<i>-Jeez, Grandma!</i>

1563
01:14:43,818 --> 01:14:46,354
<i>I'm on a frigging date!</i>
<i>I am not hungry.</i>

1564
01:14:46,486 --> 01:14:49,056
<i>Oh, I hope he's a nice boy!</i>

1565
01:14:49,757 --> 01:14:51,792
<i>No, Grandma, he's not.</i>

1566
01:14:51,926 --> 01:14:54,295
<i>He's just another liar,</i>
<i>like Grandpa!</i>

1567
01:14:54,428 --> 01:14:57,198
<i>Well, don't make a mess</i>
<i>in there again!</i>

1568
01:14:57,798 --> 01:15:00,267
<i>You know what, Grandma?</i>
<i>I will have that dinner.</i>

1569
01:15:00,401 --> 01:15:02,003
<i>I'm wasting my time here.</i>

1570
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:03,371
Whoa.

1571
01:15:04,572 --> 01:15:07,975
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- You're watching this?

1572
01:15:08,109 --> 01:15:09,610
Get out of here.

1573
01:15:30,164 --> 01:15:34,301
- What the heck are you up to,
Samuel Gray Junior?

1574
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:37,471
I told you I had a mission.

1575
01:15:38,139 --> 01:15:39,740
-I rented bikes.
-I see that.

1576
01:15:39,874 --> 01:15:40,908
I did.

1577
01:15:41,042 --> 01:15:42,376
And the only way
to get them back

1578
01:15:42,511 --> 01:15:45,279
is if you and I,
we ride them back to the store.

1579
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:47,248
Yeah, if I break my wrist,

1580
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:49,316
-I will kill you.
-You won't break your wrist.

1581
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:53,120
- Come on. You can trust me.
- Can I?

1582
01:15:53,254 --> 01:15:54,488
Ish. Trust me, ish.

1583
01:15:54,622 --> 01:15:56,724
Okay. Well, listen.
This is a helmet.

1584
01:15:56,857 --> 01:15:58,726
Okay? Safety first.

1585
01:15:59,226 --> 01:16:01,128
-No, let me clasp it.
I got it. I got it.
-But my hair.

1586
01:16:01,262 --> 01:16:03,197
I know. It's okay.
It's just hair.

1587
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:04,698
-Ow!
-What?

1588
01:16:04,832 --> 01:16:06,867
- Just kidding.
- No. Don't do that yet.

1589
01:16:07,001 --> 01:16:10,004
-I haven't even put you
on a bike yet. Okay. Okay.
-It's fine. It's fine. I had to.

1590
01:16:10,137 --> 01:16:11,806
This, darling, is a bicycle.

1591
01:16:11,939 --> 01:16:13,774
-Okay.
-Okay? Okay.

1592
01:16:14,308 --> 01:16:16,177
All right. So listen,
the brake here is everything.

1593
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:19,080
If you feel like
you're losing control,
you put your feet down...

1594
01:16:19,747 --> 01:16:21,415
-...you press the brake.
-All right.

1595
01:16:21,816 --> 01:16:23,552
-Repeat.
-F-- Foot down, press the brake.

1596
01:16:23,684 --> 01:16:24,852
-Got it.
-Beautiful. Okay.

1597
01:16:25,252 --> 01:16:26,754
- Foot on pedal.
- Okay.

1598
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:29,524
-Come on,
you can do this. Okay?
-Okay. All right. Mm-hmm.

1599
01:16:29,657 --> 01:16:31,392
-All right. I'm gonna count.
-Okay.

1600
01:16:31,526 --> 01:16:33,194
-One.
-Two.

1601
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:34,995
Go.

1602
01:16:35,463 --> 01:16:36,831
-I got scared. Sorry.
-But you have to let go

1603
01:16:36,964 --> 01:16:38,299
-of the brake.
-All right.

1604
01:16:38,766 --> 01:16:40,234
-You got this. Okay?
-All right.

1605
01:16:40,367 --> 01:16:41,335
-Yeah.
-All right.

1606
01:16:41,969 --> 01:16:43,070
-I'm gonna push now.
-All right.

1607
01:16:43,204 --> 01:16:44,573
All right. Go.

1608
01:16:45,106 --> 01:16:46,707
- Oh, my God. You're doing it.
- Oh, my God.

1609
01:16:46,841 --> 01:16:48,476
-Ah! Oh, my God.
-You got this, Alexis. Straight.
No, no, no.

1610
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:50,444
Straight, straight, straight.
Straight, straight.

1611
01:16:50,579 --> 01:16:52,279
- Remember what I said.
You got this, okay?

1612
01:16:52,413 --> 01:16:53,614
-Oh, my God.
-Yep?

1613
01:16:53,747 --> 01:16:55,182
-I'm doing it.
-Yes.

1614
01:16:55,316 --> 01:16:56,951
Yes. It's like drinking

1615
01:16:57,084 --> 01:16:58,385
-a Coca-Cola. Right?
-Wait.

1616
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,221
-Oh, my God, I'm doing it.
-Yeah, you are.

1617
01:17:00,354 --> 01:17:01,722
-I'm doing it.
-I'm right here watching.

1618
01:17:01,856 --> 01:17:03,124
I'm right here watching.
Look at that.

1619
01:17:03,257 --> 01:17:04,725
-Are you holding me?
-No, no, no. Yeah.

1620
01:17:04,859 --> 01:17:06,026
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah, no, I'm holding you.

1621
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,529
-Wait, wait.
-No, I'm holding you.

1622
01:17:07,661 --> 01:17:08,462
I'm not holding you!

1623
01:17:08,597 --> 01:17:09,430
I'm not holding you.

1624
01:17:09,564 --> 01:17:10,931
Yes! You're doing it.

1625
01:17:11,065 --> 01:17:12,867
- Oh, my--
That was fucking great.

1626
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,335
Are you okay, Alexis?

1627
01:17:14,468 --> 01:17:15,736
-Yeah.
-Oh, that's fine.

1628
01:17:15,870 --> 01:17:17,404
A bush in your face
never hurt, huh?

1629
01:17:17,539 --> 01:17:20,241
- I hate bushes in my face.
- I know you do.

1630
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:26,113
You got this.

1631
01:17:26,647 --> 01:17:27,815
Remember what I told you, okay?

1632
01:17:28,182 --> 01:17:30,585
- Ah, ah.
- Oh!

1633
01:17:33,954 --> 01:17:35,823
You know, you're
actually a pretty good teacher.

1634
01:17:37,691 --> 01:17:39,193
Uh, I'm actually a better rider.

1635
01:17:39,927 --> 01:17:41,729
Yeah. Let me show you
some tricks.

1636
01:17:43,797 --> 01:17:44,865
Hey, Allie, you rolling?

1637
01:17:44,999 --> 01:17:47,268
Yeah, I got-- I got you, okay.

1638
01:17:47,401 --> 01:17:48,736
Watch this.

1639
01:17:58,112 --> 01:17:59,780
- Oh.
- I'm okay.

1640
01:17:59,914 --> 01:18:01,282
-Okay.
-Keep rolling.

1641
01:18:01,415 --> 01:18:02,983
All right, I'm rolling...

1642
01:18:07,121 --> 01:18:08,189
Oh.

1643
01:18:08,322 --> 01:18:09,356
S-- Samuel, uh...

1644
01:18:11,692 --> 01:18:12,760
I think you're bleeding.

1645
01:18:12,893 --> 01:18:14,295
No, I'm not bleeding.

1646
01:18:14,795 --> 01:18:15,996
Oh, shoot. I'm bleeding.

1647
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:17,298
But I'm okay. No, no, no.

1648
01:18:17,431 --> 01:18:19,233
I have just one move
I wanna show you.

1649
01:18:20,034 --> 01:18:21,570
Keep rolling the camera, Allie.

1650
01:18:22,036 --> 01:18:23,638
-Keep rolling the camera.
-Oh.

1651
01:18:23,771 --> 01:18:25,206
O-- Okay. Yeah.

1652
01:18:32,913 --> 01:18:34,982
- Oh, God.
- Ah, ah.

1653
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:37,885
-You okay?
-Oh, oh.

1654
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:42,089
I'm good.

1655
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,729
I'm good. I'm good.

1656
01:18:49,496 --> 01:18:51,165
Oh. Oh.

1657
01:18:53,602 --> 01:18:54,969
Stupid bike.

1658
01:18:59,674 --> 01:19:00,808
bike reading.

1659
01:19:11,085 --> 01:19:13,187
<i>♪ We know we know ♪</i>

1660
01:19:13,988 --> 01:19:16,223

1661
01:19:16,357 --> 01:19:18,792
<i>♪ Fork in the road ♪</i>

1662
01:19:25,032 --> 01:19:27,501
You know,
being sad makes you frown,

1663
01:19:27,636 --> 01:19:29,136
and frowning gives you wrinkles.

1664
01:19:30,204 --> 01:19:31,740
Better.

1665
01:19:31,872 --> 01:19:33,742
I'm sorry your job
got cut short.

1666
01:19:33,874 --> 01:19:35,976
Yeah. Samuel
not only got a concussion,

1667
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:38,680
a broken tooth,
but he also fractured his leg

1668
01:19:38,812 --> 01:19:39,913
and his coccyx bone.

1669
01:19:40,047 --> 01:19:42,517
-You broke the boy's dick?
-No.

1670
01:19:42,651 --> 01:19:44,586
His butt bone.

1671
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:47,855
He's such a show-off.
I had forgotten about that.

1672
01:19:47,988 --> 01:19:50,291
I was so distracted
by his blue eyes,

1673
01:19:50,424 --> 01:19:53,360
- I forgot how self-centered he is.
-  -Wrinkles.

1674
01:19:56,564 --> 01:19:58,365
If Marco and I
split permanently,

1675
01:19:58,499 --> 01:20:01,035
I'm gonna have to tell Emma
I'm gonna get another divorce.

1676
01:20:01,168 --> 01:20:04,038
You know you don't really want
to divorce Marco, baby,

1677
01:20:04,405 --> 01:20:07,141
but your ego
is getting in the way.

1678
01:20:07,742 --> 01:20:10,844
-Why don't you tell me
how you really feel?
-You don't honestly believe

1679
01:20:10,978 --> 01:20:13,515
Miss I Showed Everyone
My Titties At Lunch

1680
01:20:13,648 --> 01:20:14,882
was really Marco's fault?

1681
01:20:15,416 --> 01:20:17,619
That bitch puts fucks
before friends.

1682
01:20:18,152 --> 01:20:20,354
And he's successful,
loyal, and sort of good-looking.

1683
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:23,023
Shit, your post
put out the bat signal

1684
01:20:23,157 --> 01:20:25,326
for all them bitches.

1685
01:20:25,459 --> 01:20:27,127
Why didn't you tell me
this a month ago?

1686
01:20:27,261 --> 01:20:28,495
Would you have listened?

1687
01:20:29,496 --> 01:20:30,431
You weren't ready.

1688
01:20:30,931 --> 01:20:32,667
And I really wanted you
to take the job.

1689
01:20:33,167 --> 01:20:35,302
I knew you and Marco
would be okay.

1690
01:20:41,776 --> 01:20:42,976
Marco will forgive you, baby.

1691
01:20:43,511 --> 01:20:45,346
You'll think of something.

1692
01:20:52,986 --> 01:20:54,488
Hey, give me
another bottle, ladies.

1693
01:20:54,622 --> 01:20:56,890
I know what we're
trying to do here.

1694
01:20:59,661 --> 01:21:00,562
Okay.

1695
01:21:01,763 --> 01:21:02,863
I deserve that.

1696
01:21:04,898 --> 01:21:09,069
Tracey accidentally
included me on the group text
for the nail party.

1697
01:21:10,104 --> 01:21:13,273
I came here
to apologize for lying

1698
01:21:13,407 --> 01:21:16,243
and posting that Marco and I
were divorcing.

1699
01:21:16,944 --> 01:21:19,480
I was really sad, Alexis.

1700
01:21:19,614 --> 01:21:21,716
I ate a pint of ice cream
every night

1701
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:24,619
and gained, like, ten pounds.

1702
01:21:24,753 --> 01:21:26,554
- It's okay.
You still look great.

1703
01:21:26,688 --> 01:21:28,122
I'm so sorry.

1704
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:31,358
You all may not
know this, but...

1705
01:21:32,226 --> 01:21:33,026
...I have trust issues.

1706
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:34,662
We know.

1707
01:21:35,062 --> 01:21:37,398
Oh. Okay.

1708
01:21:38,232 --> 01:21:40,100
Look.

1709
01:21:40,234 --> 01:21:42,302
I'm on my second marriage.
All right?

1710
01:21:42,837 --> 01:21:45,139
And I'm fucking up big time.

1711
01:21:45,272 --> 01:21:47,141
I'm making
all the same mistakes.

1712
01:21:48,041 --> 01:21:49,544
And now I've pushed
you all away.

1713
01:21:50,944 --> 01:21:52,179
I'm really sorry.

1714
01:21:53,681 --> 01:21:55,382
Can you please forgive me?

1715
01:21:58,218 --> 01:21:59,987
Of course we can forgive you.

1716
01:22:02,757 --> 01:22:04,592
I'm sorry too.

1717
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,629
I mean, we've all acted
a little crazy

1718
01:22:07,762 --> 01:22:08,863
at some point or another.

1719
01:22:08,996 --> 01:22:10,164
- Right.
- Yeah.

1720
01:22:10,297 --> 01:22:11,833
Yeah.

1721
01:22:11,965 --> 01:22:12,867
We heard about Debby.

1722
01:22:13,267 --> 01:22:15,570
And we all unfriended
that bitch.

1723
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:17,237
-Yes.
-Oh yeah.

1724
01:22:17,806 --> 01:22:18,706
My girls.

1725
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:23,410
Ladies...

1726
01:22:24,344 --> 01:22:25,979
...I need your help
with something.

1727
01:22:26,346 --> 01:22:28,348
-Hmm.
-But first...

1728
01:22:29,116 --> 01:22:30,117
...let's get fucked up.

1729
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:34,988
-Cheers.
-I missed you bitches so much.

1730
01:22:37,659 --> 01:22:39,226
-Come on.
-This is just what you need

1731
01:22:39,359 --> 01:22:41,195
to get your mind off things.
You'll see.

1732
01:22:41,696 --> 01:22:45,499
The bumping music,
the sexy bodies, the libations.

1733
01:22:45,633 --> 01:22:47,167
-It's my element.
-I thought your element

1734
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:48,903
was more the, uh,
tomato sauce and cheese vibe.

1735
01:22:49,036 --> 01:22:52,540
- I am a man of many tastes.
-  -Hmm.

1736
01:22:54,542 --> 01:22:57,277
Marco, when you walk
through that curtain...

1737
01:22:58,078 --> 01:22:59,914
...your life
will effectively change.

1738
01:23:00,047 --> 01:23:04,218
- All of your dreams
are about to come true.

1739
01:23:08,088 --> 01:23:09,958
Damn, didn't work.
I'm still here.

1740
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:12,092
Cute. Come on.

1741
01:23:19,399 --> 01:23:22,269
Guys, nobody's here.

1742
01:23:23,571 --> 01:23:25,305
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no, no.

1743
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:27,842
This is not one of your online
dating scheme disasters.

1744
01:23:27,976 --> 01:23:30,210
-I-- I can't be put through that
again, guys.
-No, no, no.

1745
01:23:30,344 --> 01:23:33,046
- No, I'm not-- I don't wanna
do that again. Please!

1746
01:23:40,788 --> 01:23:45,927
Welcome to
Alexis' Lingerie Fashion show.

1747
01:23:46,059 --> 01:23:49,029
Marco, will you please...

1748
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:51,766
...take your seat?

1749
01:23:53,768 --> 01:23:54,669
Okay.

1750
01:23:55,803 --> 01:23:57,705
- How long did you guys
know about this?

1751
01:23:57,839 --> 01:23:59,039
-Mm-hmm.
-Huh?

1752
01:24:01,141 --> 01:24:02,944
The most important job
a friend has...

1753
01:24:03,076 --> 01:24:04,444
Is helping out his homie.

1754
01:24:05,178 --> 01:24:08,048
-Wow.
-The first out tonight

1755
01:24:08,181 --> 01:24:11,886
is Tina La Cochina.

1756
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:12,820
Whoo!

1757
01:24:12,954 --> 01:24:13,988
Oh, Jesus.

1758
01:24:14,121 --> 01:24:15,690
No need to worry, Marco.

1759
01:24:15,823 --> 01:24:17,559
Alexis has invited Tina.

1760
01:24:17,692 --> 01:24:20,895
Your bride wants you to know
that she knows

1761
01:24:21,029 --> 01:24:23,330
that temptation is everywhere,

1762
01:24:23,463 --> 01:24:26,166
but she trusts you.

1763
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,068
Hi, Marco.

1764
01:24:28,201 --> 01:24:30,103
Hi, Tina.

1765
01:24:30,237 --> 01:24:32,674
-Oh, whoa.
-Miss Tina is wearing

1766
01:24:32,807 --> 01:24:34,976
the trashiest thing
in her closet,

1767
01:24:35,108 --> 01:24:37,612
provided for her
by her last conquest

1768
01:24:37,745 --> 01:24:39,814
before he dumped her
for the nanny.

1769
01:24:40,414 --> 01:24:42,650
Fuck you,
baby daddy number three.

1770
01:24:42,784 --> 01:24:45,587
Tina. All right.

1771
01:24:46,386 --> 01:24:49,591
- Whoo!
- And here we have Julia.

1772
01:24:49,724 --> 01:24:53,061
She chose this piece
because it's the lingerie

1773
01:24:53,193 --> 01:24:55,630
her soon-to-be ex-husband

1774
01:24:55,763 --> 01:24:59,033
provided for the woman
with whom he's cheating.

1775
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:00,768
She slashed it
with a box cutter,

1776
01:25:00,902 --> 01:25:03,871
but she lost so much weight
from the affair,

1777
01:25:04,005 --> 01:25:06,406
she fits into it now.

1778
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:08,475
Why let it go to waste?

1779
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:10,511
-Hi, Bob.
-Looking hot, baby.

1780
01:25:10,645 --> 01:25:12,680
- Yeah.
- Yes!

1781
01:25:14,147 --> 01:25:16,084
And we have Estanley.

1782
01:25:16,216 --> 01:25:18,586
Oh, Estanley is here
to remind us

1783
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:23,423
that all shapes and sizes
can be sexy.

1784
01:25:24,025 --> 01:25:25,425
Just add a little confidence

1785
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,962
and even you can pull
this outfit off.

1786
01:25:30,665 --> 01:25:32,366
All right. Okay.
Enough, Estanley.

1787
01:25:32,499 --> 01:25:35,168
- Enough.
- Yeah. Go, Estanley.

1788
01:25:36,771 --> 01:25:39,540
Are you a dirty boy, Estanley?

1789
01:25:39,674 --> 01:25:41,174
Yes, I am.

1790
01:25:41,308 --> 01:25:43,477
-Do you--
-She completes me.

1791
01:25:43,611 --> 01:25:45,212
Are you c--

1792
01:25:48,215 --> 01:25:49,617
Bob, that's the one--

1793
01:25:49,751 --> 01:25:51,853
- Yeah.
- The one-- Oh, Jesus.

1794
01:25:51,986 --> 01:25:54,856
Here we have Miss Beach,

1795
01:25:54,989 --> 01:25:57,391
who is a school teacher by day

1796
01:25:57,525 --> 01:26:00,962
-and a naughty girl by night.
-Yes.

1797
01:26:01,095 --> 01:26:03,463
Oh.

1798
01:26:04,331 --> 01:26:06,734
I teach the hardest lessons
after school.

1799
01:26:06,868 --> 01:26:09,604
I bet you do, Barbie.
I bet you do.

1800
01:26:09,737 --> 01:26:12,239
I got a hard lesson for you.

1801
01:26:12,674 --> 01:26:15,877
Next we have Natalie and Tracey.

1802
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:20,615
Remember, Marco, you can look,
but you can't touch.

1803
01:26:20,748 --> 01:26:25,485
You should only be dipping your
biscotti into Alexis's coffee.

1804
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:27,320
- Oh, my biscotti.
- Yeah.

1805
01:26:27,454 --> 01:26:29,389
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

1806
01:26:29,891 --> 01:26:32,192
- Hi, Marco.
- Oh, hi, how are you?

1807
01:26:32,325 --> 01:26:34,394
- Ooh. Biscotti.
- Tracey.

1808
01:26:34,529 --> 01:26:35,328
-Oh.
-Okay.

1809
01:26:38,066 --> 01:26:42,637
And now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

1810
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:44,337
I present to you

1811
01:26:44,471 --> 01:26:49,977
Mrs. Alexis Laguna.

1812
01:26:58,318 --> 01:26:59,219
Baby

1813
01:26:59,754 --> 01:27:02,190
Baby, baby, baby.

1814
01:27:30,885 --> 01:27:34,622
- I've missed you
so much.

1815
01:27:34,756 --> 01:27:37,658
I missed you, too.
I missed you, too.

1816
01:27:37,792 --> 01:27:39,026
Oh, my God.

1817
01:27:46,033 --> 01:27:47,235
Who gave those to you?

1818
01:27:47,367 --> 01:27:49,604
Who gave them to you?
Bob, did you--

1819
01:27:51,239 --> 01:27:52,073
Get over here.

1820
01:28:03,751 --> 01:28:06,788
-I'm sorry.
I acted like an idiot.
-You did.

1821
01:28:07,722 --> 01:28:09,924
And I love you for it.

1822
01:28:10,825 --> 01:28:14,562
Baby, divorce brought you to me
and me to you.

1823
01:28:15,328 --> 01:28:16,631
No matter what shit
comes our way,

1824
01:28:16,764 --> 01:28:19,066
I wanna work
through it with you.

1825
01:28:21,536 --> 01:28:22,937
I'm not good at that.

1826
01:28:23,538 --> 01:28:24,639
I know.

1827
01:28:25,706 --> 01:28:29,877
And sometimes my insecurities
get the best of me.

1828
01:28:30,011 --> 01:28:30,978
Oh.

1829
01:28:31,344 --> 01:28:32,547
I know that too.

1830
01:28:34,115 --> 01:28:35,516
I wanted to show you that

1831
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:39,554
-temptation will
always be around.
-Mm-hmm.

1832
01:28:40,621 --> 01:28:44,125
But I've realized that
if I want to stay married...

1833
01:28:44,992 --> 01:28:47,061
...it's got to be
about our relationship.

1834
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:50,497
I trust you...

1835
01:28:51,799 --> 01:28:54,501
...and you make me happy.

1836
01:28:56,771 --> 01:28:58,105
Do I make you happy?

1837
01:28:58,506 --> 01:28:59,807
Absolutely.

1838
01:29:01,341 --> 01:29:03,077
You're crazy. You know that?

1839
01:29:03,211 --> 01:29:04,545
Oh yeah.

1840
01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:06,247
But I prefer your brand

1841
01:29:06,379 --> 01:29:08,883
of crazy over anybody else's.

1842
01:29:10,483 --> 01:29:11,919
I choose you.

1843
01:29:21,262 --> 01:29:22,063
One more thing.

1844
01:29:22,196 --> 01:29:23,097
What?

1845
01:29:25,566 --> 01:29:26,667
Champagne.

1846
01:29:30,972 --> 01:29:33,373
I'm so happy
you two are back together.

1847
01:29:34,008 --> 01:29:36,777
-Champagne, sir.
-Thank you.

1848
01:29:37,278 --> 01:29:38,913
And a grape juice for you.

1849
01:29:39,046 --> 01:29:41,315
Thank you.

1850
01:29:41,448 --> 01:29:42,650
Grape juice, baby?

1851
01:29:44,218 --> 01:29:47,420
I won't be drinking
for the next seven months.

1852
01:29:48,689 --> 01:29:50,925
Why-- Why is-- Why?

1853
01:29:52,693 --> 01:29:53,961
Are you-- D--

1854
01:29:54,729 --> 01:29:55,897
Are we pregnant?

1855
01:29:56,463 --> 01:29:57,497
Oh, my God, baby.

1856
01:30:07,241 --> 01:30:09,076
We're having a baby!

1857
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:10,111
What?

1858
01:30:11,012 --> 01:30:12,847
Oh, my God!

1859
01:30:13,648 --> 01:30:14,982
Hey, hey!

1860
01:30:17,051 --> 01:30:18,819
Can you believe this?

1861
01:30:20,388 --> 01:30:21,856
This is amazing.

1862
01:30:21,989 --> 01:30:23,090
This is amazing.

1863
01:30:31,699 --> 01:30:33,834
Yeah!

1864
01:30:38,839 --> 01:30:41,609
- Hell yeah.
- Check them out.

1865
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:41,302
<i>Well, you know,</i>
<i>I figure, A, a divorced man</i>

1866
01:31:41,435 --> 01:31:43,437
<i>has already gotten</i>
<i>all of his cheating out of him</i>

1867
01:31:43,571 --> 01:31:45,373
<i>and, B, I don't want kids.</i>

1868
01:31:45,506 --> 01:31:48,109
<i>I saw what they did</i>
<i>to my mom's vagina.</i>

1869
01:31:48,242 --> 01:31:51,545
<i>- Ugh.</i>
- How did you kn--

1870
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:53,581
No, I'm not gonna be
touching that one.

1871
01:31:53,714 --> 01:31:55,349
<i>Yeah. Neither did my dad.</i>

1872
01:31:55,483 --> 01:31:56,984
<i>That's why he cheated.</i>

1873
01:31:58,786 --> 01:32:01,188
Oh, you like cars, huh?

1874
01:32:01,655 --> 01:32:02,623
Yeah, sure.

1875
01:32:03,224 --> 01:32:06,060
Do you prefer
a straight-six or a V8?

1876
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,630
- Oh, I'm kind of allergic
to tomato juice.

1877
01:32:09,764 --> 01:32:12,199
-All natural here.
-What? Bravo.

1878
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:13,834
Wait. Do you want to touch them?

1879
01:32:14,301 --> 01:32:15,269
-I would.
-Okay.

1880
01:32:15,403 --> 01:32:16,303
Okay.

1881
01:32:18,005 --> 01:32:19,874
I think they are real.

1882
01:32:20,007 --> 01:32:21,242
-They're very real.
-Is the other one real?

1883
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:22,511
No, just-- just the left one

1884
01:32:22,643 --> 01:32:23,778
-actually.
-Hey.

1885
01:32:23,911 --> 01:32:25,179
Let's go somewhere else. This--

1886
01:32:25,312 --> 01:32:26,747
I, I wanna get a tea bag.

1887
01:32:27,248 --> 01:32:28,816
-I'm sure you do.
-Hey, you get it?

1888
01:32:29,483 --> 01:32:31,052
-Don't-- Don't listen to him.
Come on.
-A tea bag, bro.

1889
01:32:31,185 --> 01:32:32,620
-Come on.
-You get it, right?

1890
01:32:32,753 --> 01:32:34,088
- Tea bag.
- Stop.

1891
01:32:34,221 --> 01:32:35,756
Tea bag. You guys know
what I'm saying.

1892
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:37,526
-Right?
-What are you? Two? Come on.

1893
01:32:37,658 --> 01:32:39,427
Tea bag. He gets it.

1894
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:40,995
Please let me be called.

1895
01:32:41,395 --> 01:32:44,632
I hate being called last like
in fucking sports my whole life.

1896
01:32:45,132 --> 01:32:46,901
Being the chubby kid
in gym class,

1897
01:32:47,468 --> 01:32:48,869
the chubby kid at softball.

1898
01:32:49,437 --> 01:32:50,237
I hated that.
