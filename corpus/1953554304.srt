01:18:45,922 --> 01:18:48,656
-DO YOU WANT TO JUST GO--
-YES, YOU CAN.

1349

PICK THE ONE
WHO SEES WHAT I COULDN'T.

1351
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:04,672
I SOLD YOU SHORT.
I SPOILED YOUR BROTHER,

1352

THE WIDOWS OF KABUL
AND I THANK YOU.

1382
01:21:05,061 --> 01:21:08,295
YOU KNOW, I MADE THAT MYSELF.
NOT ALL OF IT.

1383
01:21:08,297 --> 01:21:12,166
BUT I DID LEARN HOW TO WEAVE
THIS WEEK THANKS TO YOU.

1384
01:21:12,168 --> 01:21:15,402
HMM. AND I LEARNED
SO MUCH THIS WEEK THANKS TO YOU

1385
01:21:15,404 --> 01:21:17,504
AND THE D-TOWN HITLIST
THAT YOU LEFT FOR ME.

MADE THAT AND GAVE IT TO ME
AS A HOUSEWARMING GIFT.

1390
01:21:30,753 --> 01:21:33,854
THERE ARE SO MANY GAYS DOWNTOWN.

OH, NO. HE'S NOT--

1392

I WOULD NOT GIVE YOU
SOME CHEESY MAP.

SORRY. AND THANK YOU.

1397
01:21:53,342 --> 01:21:56,677
BUT YOU KNOW, THE REAL GIFT
YOU GAVE ME WAS BEING ABLE
TO STAY HERE.

1398

DIFFERENT PERSON NOW.

BEFORE DANIEL IS GOING
TO MAKE YOU PARTNER.

ABOUT THE COLOR THOUGH.
