183
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,475
Can we get someone
who does the sign language?

184
00:10:06,518 --> 00:10:08,520
Like, right away?Mm-hmm.

185
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:11,045
You heard him -- let's get
an interpreter here.

186
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:15,527
Did you...Touch anything?

187
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:18,095
I, uh...

188
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,059
I touched the front door.

189
00:10:25,102 --> 00:10:29,063
I picked up the phone.

190
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:31,108
And, um...

191
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,593
I tried to pull the knife out.

192
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:42,163
Great! She smudges the prints
on the murder weapon.

193
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:44,078
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:47,777
I read lips.

195
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,652
Would you excuse me
a minute?

196
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:58,658
There goes my tee time.

197
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:03,445
Tibball: Cynthia thornby
is here of her own volition

198
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:05,839
to answer questions
regarding Dr. Sander Morgan

199
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:07,928
and her appearance
at the political rally

200
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:09,190
on the day of his murder.

201
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:12,976
Miss thornby,
approximately 11:15 last night,

202
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,630
where were you?

203
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,329
I was in a car on my way home
from a radio talk show.

204
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:22,029
Was anybody with you?
See anybody along the way?

205
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:24,205
My husband.
We rode home together.

206
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:27,425
Does your husband
share your views on abortion?

207
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:29,819
Yes, he does.

208
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:31,908
How do you feel
about Dr. Morgan's death.

209
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:34,084
I didn't do it.

210
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:36,347
I don't know who did,

211
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:40,090
but if it'll stop
the murder of unborn babies,

212
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:42,614
then it is a good thing.

213
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:48,011
What exactly did you mean
when you yelled at Dr. Morgan

214
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:49,404
that you'd stop him?

215
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:51,362
It meant that I would work

216
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:55,671
to make sure that he was
defeated in the senate campaign!

217
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,413
I didn't kill him! I don't
have to put up with this!!

218
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:00,458
These are just questions.

219
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:06,769
Well, if you want to
charge me with something,

220
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:08,162
go ahead and do it.

221
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:13,950
I need you to put me through
to that journalist in New York.

222
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:17,780
Yeah.
About 10 minutes early,

223
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:19,782
but if I can finish
the interview

224
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:23,003
before I get to the airport,
that would be really good.

225
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:26,093
I've never taken a case
I didn't believe in.

226
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,703
No, I am notthe problem.

227
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,792
If you want to change
the system,

228
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:31,794
you take it up
with the legislature.

229
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:33,927
Why? Because my job
is to provide

230
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,972
the best defense that I can.

231
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:38,670
Look I have time
for one more question.

232
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:40,716
Man: ...District attorney
Carter tamarin

233
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,978
at the scene...

234
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:44,764
Have I ever regretted
taking a case?

235
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:45,939
...no suspects and witnesses.

236
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:47,636
All we know right now

237
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,073
is that Dr. Morgan's
event coordinator, Dana Lacey,

238
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:52,119
was in the house
at the time of the murder.

239
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:53,294
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

240
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:55,905
Can you take me back
to the hotel?

241
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:01,476
Stu, I need you
on the next plane to Memphis.

242
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,348
Man: The tragic murder
of Dr. Sander Morgan

243
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:06,394
comes at a time
when he was considered

244
00:13:06,437 --> 00:13:09,092
the front-runner in Tennessee's
senatorial campaign.

245
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:10,790
More is now known

246
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,097
about Dr. Morgan's
event coordinator, Dana Lacey,

247
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,796
who was in the house
at the time of the murder.

248
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,146
Sources say she is
a long-time Morgan supporter

249
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:21,017
and a close family friend.

250
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:23,846
Morgan is survived by his son,
William, a city councilman,

251
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,849
his daughter-in-law, penny,
and a granddaughter.

252
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:29,286
Ms. Lacey,
a prominent businesswoman...

253
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,722
There you are.

254
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:33,508
William, some of the relatives
are asking for you.

255
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:35,118
Right.

256
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:38,121
In times like this, you
ought to be with your family.

257
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:39,514
Well, I am.

258
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:44,867
Then I think you've seen
enough bad news for one day.

259
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:48,610
Sweetheart, go play.

260
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:07,934
I'm in charge
of the sander Morgan murder.

261
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:09,413
How can I help you?

262
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:12,852
Check the ledgers for
Dr. Morgan's campaign funding.

263
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,419
There may be some irregularities
that would be of interest.

264
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:17,334
I appreciate the help,
miss...

265
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:18,988
Mrs.morgan.

266
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:21,773
Mrs. Williammorgan,
daughter-in-law of the deceased.

267
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:27,214
Uh-huh. And where might
we find these ledgers?

268
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:35,004
Man, his campaign
went through a lot of money.

269
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:39,748
Phone bills, media consultants,
hotels, airlines --

270
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,793
this guy saved everything.

271
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:43,143
I call it commingling of funds.

272
00:14:43,186 --> 00:14:45,449
That's against the law.

273
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:48,017
Some of the contributions
we were counting on

274
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:49,105
were delayed,

275
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:51,020
so I loaned money
to the campaign.

276
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:52,630
I was paying myself back.

277
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:55,677
Tibball: You have
a record of the loan?

278
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,898
Yeah, I think so.
I have to look for it.

279
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:02,945
This kind of
questionable financing

280
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:05,556
could wreck a campaign.

281
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,082
And Dr. Morgan
was upset by it, wasn't he?

282
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,997
No.

283
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,999
Well, he circled it
for some reason.

284
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:15,392
He was fine with it.

285
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:18,352
Let's get this straight.

286
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:21,398
You're sitting with a guy,
he walks to the front door,

287
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:23,096
gets a knife in the stomach.

288
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:25,576
You try to help,
but you don't see a thing.

289
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,276
Nobody running away, nobody
getting in a car, nothing.

290
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,669
And this killer
walked to the doorway

291
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:33,758
seeing your car
in the driveway.

292
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:35,543
It's pretty bold.

293
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:36,892
You think I killed him?

294
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,415
Somebodykilled him!

295
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:39,808
You were there!

296
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:41,331
Nobody else was!

297
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,333
And your fingerprints
are on the knife.

298
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,945
I already explained that!

299
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,250
And you were stealing!

300
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:48,730
It was a loan!

301
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:51,820
Those payments from the campaign
to me were nothing more

302
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:54,475
than payments that I
had given to the campaign.

303
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:58,696
Are you being represented
by an attorney, miss Lacey?

304
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:02,091
No?

305
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:07,879
What are you doing here?

306
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:10,882
When I heard there were
no suspects and no witnesses,

307
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:12,884
and only you
were at the house,

308
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:14,974
I thought you might need
a lawyer.

309
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:19,021
But I haven't been charged.

310
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:21,502
Looks to me like
you're the only suspect.

311
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,286
You're going to need
some help.

312
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,811
What we have to determine is,
am I the best lawyer for you,

313
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:30,206
and do you want to hire me?

314
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,731
Is there any better
criminal lawyer in Memphis?

315
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:35,777
Or anywhere?

316
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,735
No.

317
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:40,042
Then I want you.

318
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:43,045
Legally, I'm obligated
to tell you one other thing.

319
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,179
Carter tamarin and I
knew each other in law school.

320
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:48,137
We used to date.

321
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:50,139
Oh.

322
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:52,750
Well, good.

323
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:54,187
Then you know the enemy.

324
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,579
Okay.

325
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:58,234
Then you have Lilian Rose Martin
as your attorney.

326
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:01,542
Okay.

327
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:03,065
I need you to tell me

328
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:06,199
everything that you
told the police.

329
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:25,174
Look at this --
here, here, and there.

330
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:27,611
Wow,
what do we have here?

331
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:29,439
And there, too.

332
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:38,709
Get youroffice together,
and maybe...

333
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:41,756
Oh, look, just stop
right there, all right, Lily?

334
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,845
You want some advice
as a friend?

335
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:47,109
Walk away from this
because you're going to lose it.

336
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:49,416
I'll tell you what --
you want the case?

337
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,679
Plead murder 2 --
we'll call it a day.

338
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:54,769
Otherwise, I am telling you
you are wasting your time.

339
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:57,206
Deaf woman,
well-liked in her community,

340
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,035
runs her own business --
I'll take my chances.

341
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,124
You --
you don't seem to get it!

342
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:06,085
You don't want to take your
chances in this town, all right?

343
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,217
I mean,
people around here --

344
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:10,654
they got contempt
for lawyers like you.

345
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:12,526
That jury
is going to look at you,

346
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:15,355
and all they're going to see
is every famous slimeball

347
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:18,445
that you have ever gotten off
on some kind of technicality.

348
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:20,534
It's not the time
or the place,

349
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:22,144
and I just -- I just...

350
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:24,103
Is this personal here?

351
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,235
Is that what this is about?

352
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,020
You want to settle
some old score with me?

353
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:31,327
What about the pro-lifers,
Carter, huh?

354
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:33,155
Where the hell are they?

355
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:35,114
I saw a woman threaten
sander Morgan's life

356
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,724
the day of the murder!

357
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,160
Where is she, huh?

358
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:39,553
She was in here.

359
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:41,598
Her alibi checked out.

360
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:45,167
That's one out of what --
a thousand?

361
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:47,169
My client is not
going to wait that long

362
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:48,605
to be released, okay?

363
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:50,129
You have no motive...

364
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,131
She was stealing funds,

365
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:54,045
and the guy
was going to expose her!

366
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:56,178
And no jury
is going to buy that!

367
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:58,267
We got her fingerprints
on the knife!

368
00:18:58,311 --> 00:19:00,704
She was the only person
at the crime scene --

369
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:02,619
and that
can all be explained!

370
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:04,491
All right.

371
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:07,755
You know what?
You want this...

372
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:10,366
Then let's see her
explain this.

373
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,196
We just found those
in sander Morgan's house.

374
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,721
Those are letters
written by Dana sue Lacey

375
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:19,767
threatening to kill him.

376
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:24,206
Thanks, tibball.

377
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,601
Well, we got
both the interpreter...

378
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:31,257
And I guess
we got the lawyer present.

379
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,693
Go on.

380
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:35,870
You're under arrest
for the murder of sander Morgan.

381
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:38,046
You have the right
to remain silent.

382
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:40,135
You have the right
to an attorney.

383
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,224
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

384
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:44,226
one will be assigned
to you.

385
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,229
Anything you say can
and will be used against you.

386
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:48,709
You understand these rights?

387
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:50,885
You knew where you
were going with this.

388
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:52,191
I knew where I was --

389
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:55,237
you could have let me know
as soon as I came in!

390
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:56,456
I told you I had something!

391
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:59,372
If you want to play,
we can play!

392
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:02,070
I will seeyou in court!
I want copies of that!

393
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:03,419
Some things never change!

394
00:20:03,463 --> 00:20:05,160
Whatever!

395
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:26,181
So, I need you
to tell me about the letters.

396
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:31,969
Did you see
the dates on them?

397
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:33,797
They were 15 years old,

398
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:35,799
but I still need
to know about them --

399
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:37,148
about your past with sander.

400
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:39,194
I need to know
the whole story.

401
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,244
[ Sighs ]

402
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:52,860
Michael: When I was 17,

403
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:56,255
my parents
died in a car accident.

404
00:20:56,298 --> 00:21:00,389
They were my only connection
to the outside world.

405
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:04,263
And suddenly,
I was all alone.

406
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:08,745
Can you understand...

407
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:12,401
What the world was like to me?

408
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:18,320
I couldn't imagine myself
in it.

409
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:24,805
I couldn't imagine
there was a place for me.

410
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:26,285
What did you do?

411
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,290
I tried to kill myself.

412
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:38,340
Michael: I woke up in hell --

413
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:40,560
the hollyridge state hospital.

414
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:49,482
I hated my parents
for deserting me --

415
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:52,093
for abandoning me.

416
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,925
Even though they died
so tragically,

417
00:21:57,968 --> 00:21:59,709
I felt abandoned.

418
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:04,192
I had fantasies
of killing myself...

419
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:08,065
And especially
killing Dr. Morgan.

420
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:10,329
Why?

421
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:19,076
He was keeping me alive.

422
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:24,604
Michael: Sander had me
write those letters.

423
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:27,998
It was part of my therapy.

424
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:32,176
I had to get my anger out
so I could move on.

425
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:38,139
He saved my life.

426
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:42,578
Anything else?

427
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:45,102
I need to know everything.

428
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,807
What are you
talking about?

429
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,243
We don't have to do this.

430
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:57,898
We just walk away.
We go back to Chicago.

431
00:22:57,941 --> 00:23:00,727
We won't even get
much publicity out of this.

432
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,425
Stu, sander Morgan
was a senate candidate.

433
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:05,209
That's a national story.

434
00:23:05,253 --> 00:23:07,168
Yeah, for about
30 seconds, maybe.

435
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:09,344
What the hell
are we doing here?

436
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,302
I think
maybe she's innocent.

437
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:13,740
Her fingerprints
were on the knife.

438
00:23:13,783 --> 00:23:15,394
There was no one else there.

439
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:17,178
There was no eyewitnesses.

440
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:19,049
You know what we called
a case like this

441
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:21,443
when I was back in homicide?
A vacation.

442
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:24,054
Look, the d.A. Has
commissioned more man-hours

443
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:25,839
in the last 24 hours

444
00:23:25,882 --> 00:23:28,189
than he has
in the last two months.

445
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:30,191
That can only mean
two things --

446
00:23:30,234 --> 00:23:33,063
his conviction rate is down,
and it's an election year.

447
00:23:33,107 --> 00:23:34,456
We don't have time for this.

448
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,459
You want to get back
at your old boyfriend -- fine.

449
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:39,113
Do it on your own time.

450
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:41,028
As this trial progresses,

451
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:44,466
there will be no doubt
as to miss Lacey's guilt.

452
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,773
Still think
we're not going to get

453
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:48,209
any press out of this?

454
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,693
We need
reasonable doubt, stu.

455
00:23:53,736 --> 00:23:55,129
Find it.

456
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:56,783
Okay, boss.

457
00:23:58,262 --> 00:23:59,394
The charges will stand.

458
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,222
Defendant
is bound over for trial.

459
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:03,398
There's still
the matter of bail.

460
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,444
Your honor,
this is a capital case.

461
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,489
Mr. Tamarin
apparently has forgotten

462
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:09,622
that the purpose of bail
is to assure

463
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:11,841
the defendant's presence
at trial.

464
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:14,365
Miss Lacey
has a business here,

465
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:15,628
a house, a reputation.

466
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:17,151
She's not about to skip town.

467
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:20,023
We believe she may be
a threat to the community.

468
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:21,634
Come on, counselor.

469
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:24,245
Just how much bail
would you suggest?

470
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:26,116
None, your honor.

471
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,509
None.

472
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:28,684
No bail.

473
00:24:28,728 --> 00:24:33,776
Defendant is released
on $100,000 bail.

474
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,866
The probable-cause hearing
will be two weeks from today.

475
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:43,046
There she is!Miss Martin!

476
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,527
What do you think
about the state's case?

477
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:47,442
Flimsy at best.

478
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,052
Woman:
What about the letters?

479
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:52,012
We're prepared
to explain those letters.

480
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:54,231
Man: What about
contribution irregularities?

481
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:56,016
When the case is presented,

482
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:59,236
it will be obvious
that my client is innocent.

483
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,847
Excuse me.

484
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,805
Miss Martin!Miss Martin!

485
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:03,893
Miss Martin!

486
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:05,678
One more question!

487
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:07,157
Come on!

488
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,380
You cannot just walk out
on the press like that!

489
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:13,903
We needthem!

490
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:16,863
This is going to lead
the 6:00 and the 11:00 news!

491
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:20,083
What difference does it make?
It's up to a jury.

492
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:22,390
And where do you think
the jury comes from?

493
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:24,348
We have to project
the right image!

494
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:26,960
I want their hearts
to ache so much for you,

495
00:25:27,003 --> 00:25:28,527
they'll never convict.

496
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:35,838
Is the lawyer talking,
or the publicity hound?

497
00:25:35,882 --> 00:25:39,146
This is a murder case!
Hello?!

498
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:42,236
You're on trial for your life!
Do you understand?! Your life!

499
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:45,195
No.

500
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:47,241
Michael: I run
a very successful business.

501
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:49,635
I have a lot of employees
who depend on me.

502
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:51,245
I make a good living.

503
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:53,160
I didn't get
to where I am

504
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:55,466
by making people
feel sorry for me.

505
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,033
If you can't accept that,

506
00:25:57,077 --> 00:25:59,558
find some other way
to get on TV.

507
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:09,742
Well, good morning.
What are you all doing here?

508
00:26:09,785 --> 00:26:12,745
Penny, did you invite
these people to our driveway.

509
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:16,183
I want to thank you all
for coming this morning.

510
00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:18,838
We have talked
long and hard about this.

511
00:26:18,881 --> 00:26:20,579
We've prayed about it.

512
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:24,147
But in the end, my wife,
penny, and I agreed that...

513
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:26,585
Well, dad would want me
to carry on.

514
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:32,460
Dr. Sander Morgan dedicated
his life to helping people.

515
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:34,767
He had big dreams
and big hopes,

516
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,160
and we cannot
let them die, can we?

517
00:26:37,204 --> 00:26:40,207
Now, you have all supported me
as your councilman,

518
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,339
as you supported
my father before me.

519
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:44,646
And you believed in me,

520
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,170
as you believed
in Dr. Sander Morgan

521
00:26:47,214 --> 00:26:50,304
and his vision
for this state of Tennessee.

522
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:52,045
Well, I'm here to tell you

523
00:26:52,088 --> 00:26:54,656
that that vision
is still alive.

524
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,703
And to announce,
along with my family,

525
00:26:57,746 --> 00:27:01,968
that there is still a Morgan
running for senate.

526
00:27:04,361 --> 00:27:07,669
Lilian:
And this was about 11:15?

527
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:11,194
Well, I was about
to go back to sleep

528
00:27:11,238 --> 00:27:15,982
when I heard this car racing
and tires screeching.

529
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:18,201
And I looked out,
and I saw a white town car

530
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:19,812
speeding down the street.

531
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:22,945
How did you know
it was a town car?

532
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:26,079
Well, I have a Cadillac.

What did you see next?

535
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,087
The front door was open.

536
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:37,264
Sander was slumped
on the front porch,

537
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:41,398
and miss Lacey was yelling
into the telephone --

538
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:43,052
frantic-like.

539
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:46,099
Mr. Collings, did you
tell your story to the police?

540
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:48,623
Oh, yes, sir.
Right away.

541
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,103
What did they say?

542
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:52,758
Well, they said
they'd get back to me,

543
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:55,412
and I haven't
heard from them since.

544
00:27:55,456 --> 00:27:59,112
Thank you, Mr. Collings,
for coming forward.

545
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:01,070
You're a real good citizen.

She's a sweet lady.

549

I was happy to help.

550
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:13,213
This is grounds
for dismissal.

Right where he said they'd be.

552
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:17,826
Don't you think it's convenient
someone called collings

553
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,046
just in time
to witness the murder?

554
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:23,527
Yeah.

555
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:26,530
We better check all our
suspects' phone records --

556
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:28,750
see who called collings
that night.

557

And we'd better do it now,

560
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:39,108
Well, how do you know
the car was accelerating

561
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:41,110
and wasn't skidding
to a stop?

Cars don't skid like this
to a stop anymore.

564
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:49,728
Well, you know
what this means, don't you?

565
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,469
Yeah. It means
I have to get a lab analysis

566
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:54,254
before you get your hopes up.

567
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:55,603
No, it means

we may actually have
a client that's not guilty.

and cause for a dismissal!

that information as evidence!

I tell you what --
I'll give it to you.

He wasan eyewitness.

583
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:35,730
He was eyewitness to a car
driving down a street.

584
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,952
You should have given them
this information, Mr. Tamarin.

He thought -- he thought
he heard something.

587
00:29:46,088 --> 00:29:48,830
He wasn't sure
where it came from.

588
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:50,310
It's not reliable.

589
00:29:50,353 --> 00:29:54,183

did possess this information

for the trial.

591
00:29:56,925 --> 00:30:00,755

instead of dismissal --

a $500 fine,

00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:07,066
and a referral
to the state bar

is repeated.

00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:03,291
I came to ask for a favor.

689
00:36:03,335 --> 00:36:07,165

to ask you a question.

Besides your father,

691
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:10,864

693
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,695
Did you know?

694
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:17,697
Mm-hmm.

695
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,308
Sure did.
Dana and dad joked about it.

696
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,657
She had threatened
to kill him,

697
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:24,530
and now she was trying
to get him elected.

698
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:26,314
Dad said it might be
the same thing.

699
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:29,839
Somebody had to know where those
were and called the police.

700
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:31,537
Why do you think that?

701
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,756
It would have taken
a pretty thorough detective

702
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,367
to have found them on his own.

703
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,846
Hmm.

704
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,500
I suppose so.

705
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:41,503
So, what was that favor
you needed?

706
00:36:41,547 --> 00:36:46,073
I want you to come out publicly
on Dana's side.

707
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:49,772
I can't do that.

708
00:36:49,816 --> 00:36:51,861
Don't you think she's innocent?

709
00:36:51,905 --> 00:36:54,212
Well, of course, we do,

710
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:56,475
but we're trying
to win an election.

711
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:59,391

888
00:46:14,815 --> 00:46:19,733
And the community perceives you
as a loving, faithful wife.

889

And in case
you're wondering,

891
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:30,526
the night sander was killed,
I was at home with my daughter.

892
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,746
Not a perfect alibi,
I understand,

893
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,792
but I'm notyour killer.

894
00:46:34,835 --> 00:46:37,969
And where was your husband?

895
00:46:38,012 --> 00:46:39,579

That's another thing
I learned in law school.

here at your house

899
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:57,075
the night of the murder,
wasn't he?

900
00:46:57,118 --> 00:46:59,164
No.

901

Dana, we go to trial
Monday morning.

902
00:47:03,124 --> 00:47:04,647
Okay, no more lies.

903
00:47:04,691 --> 00:47:07,868
Was he here that night?
The truth.

904
00:47:09,914 --> 00:47:11,263
Yes.

Was he here when you left?

Yes.

907
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:19,793
So he knew you were
going to be at sander's,

908
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,143
he knew the maid
was off that night --

909
00:47:22,187 --> 00:47:24,537
there's
our reasonable doubt.

910
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,017
Billy may have killed sander

911
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,149
and made it look
like you did it.

at the trial,

Yes!

framing you for murder.

That's not really my concern.

946

Yeah, but it doesn't go
to guilt or innocence.

947

What are you asking me to do?
Are you asking me to ignore it?

948
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:18,390
No, I'm just saying that
if all affairs were made public,

949
00:49:18,433 --> 00:49:21,393
a lot of careers
would be ruined...

950

No, Carter,

If people knew about US --

954

if they knew that you broke it
off because this is Memphis

that's not the truth.

You asked Carter not to
introduce the affair because --

966
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:15,012
because he's stubborn,

967
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:17,144
and by asking him nicely
notto do it --

968
00:50:17,188 --> 00:50:18,537
he'll do it.

969
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,800
The affair gets in,
and Dana can't blame you.

970
00:50:20,843 --> 00:50:22,671

This wasn't rage.
This was not a crime of passion.

00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:50,765
what's the maximum penalty?

1065
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:52,332
Five years in jail.

1066
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:55,335
And for a first-time offender --
in miss Lacey's case,

1067
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:57,685
an upstanding member
of the community --

1068
00:54:57,729 --> 00:55:01,646
owns her own business,
runs a local business, in fact,

1069
00:55:01,689 --> 00:55:04,779
no criminal record --
what about this case?

1070
00:55:04,823 --> 00:55:06,738
I can't presume
what the court would do.

1071
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:08,435
Well, is it fair to say

1072
00:55:08,479 --> 00:55:11,656
she might have received
a sentence lessthan five years,

1073
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:14,615
maybe even a suspended sentence
with probation?

1074
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:16,269
It's possible -- yes.

1075
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:20,882
So your thinking was that
miss Lacey killed Dr. Morgan

1076
00:55:20,926 --> 00:55:23,581
to keep from going to jail.

1077
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:25,974
That's the theory -- yes.

1078
00:55:26,018 --> 00:55:28,716
But she probably
would have never even seen

1079
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,241
the inside of a jail anyway --
not exactly a crime of passion.

1080
00:55:32,285 --> 00:55:34,766
Objection, your honor.Withdrawn.

1081
00:55:34,809 --> 00:55:36,333
I think the point is obvious.

1082
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:38,378
I assume
you've investigated

1083
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:41,381
murder cases before,
detective tibball.

1084
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:43,165
Yes. A few.

1085
00:55:43,209 --> 00:55:45,211
Good.

1086
00:55:45,254 --> 00:55:46,778
And have you ever had a case

1087
00:55:46,821 --> 00:55:48,910
where a killer
called the police

1088
00:55:48,954 --> 00:55:51,217
and then waited
for them to come?

1089
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,704
Detective tibball?

1090
00:55:59,747 --> 00:56:02,794
No.

1091
00:56:02,837 --> 00:56:04,839
No further questions.

1092
00:56:08,321 --> 00:56:11,150
How did you discover
that there was a problem

1093
00:56:11,193 --> 00:56:12,281
with campaign funds?

1094
00:56:12,325 --> 00:56:14,022
I was filling out
a finance report,

1095
00:56:14,066 --> 00:56:15,372
and I saw a discrepancy.

1096
00:56:15,415 --> 00:56:17,896
And what did you do?I called Dr. Morgan.

1097
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:19,245
How did he react?

1098
00:56:19,288 --> 00:56:20,681
He was pretty upset.

1099
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:22,683
He thought it might
cost him the election.

1100
00:56:22,727 --> 00:56:23,945
So he called Dana,

1101
00:56:23,989 --> 00:56:25,947
and he told her
to come over right away.

1102
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:27,166
Objection --

1103
00:56:27,209 --> 00:56:28,559
hearsay.
Overruled.

1104
00:56:28,602 --> 00:56:31,779
And what happened
when they met?

1105
00:56:31,823 --> 00:56:34,042
I never found out.

1106
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:37,916
Sander was killed
the next day.

1107
00:56:37,959 --> 00:56:39,134
Objection!

1108
00:56:39,178 --> 00:56:40,440
Withdrawn.

1109
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:44,575
No further questions,
your honor.

1110
00:56:44,618 --> 00:56:47,055
Per your request,
no mention of the affair.

1111
00:56:49,493 --> 00:56:52,321
Is this the prosecution's
last witness, your honor?

1112
00:56:52,365 --> 00:56:54,411
It is.

1113
00:56:59,198 --> 00:57:01,113
Mrs. Morgan...

1114
00:57:01,156 --> 00:57:03,550
You don't like
the defendant, do you?

1115
00:57:03,594 --> 00:57:06,074
I don't have feelings
one way or the other.

1116
00:57:06,118 --> 00:57:08,337
In fact, you despiseher.

1117
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:10,339
I think it's more like
the other way around.

1118
00:57:10,383 --> 00:57:13,517
Move to strike that
last sentence, your honor.

1119
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,128
The witness
will answer the question.

1120
00:57:16,171 --> 00:57:18,783
No.

1121
00:57:18,826 --> 00:57:21,568
The main reason you dislike her
is because your husband

1122
00:57:21,612 --> 00:57:24,223
was having an affair
with miss Lacey.

1123
00:57:24,266 --> 00:57:27,139
Carter: Objection --
leading the witness.

1124
00:57:27,182 --> 00:57:28,880
I'll rephrase, your honor.

1125
00:57:28,923 --> 00:57:31,796
Were your husband and miss Lacey
having an affair?

1126
00:57:34,538 --> 00:57:36,191
Yes.

1127
00:57:36,235 --> 00:57:39,804
You hate her so much, you
would do anything to hurt her,

1128
00:57:39,847 --> 00:57:42,415
wouldn't you,
Mrs. Morgan?
No, not --

1129
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,765
you were the one
who called the police

1130
00:57:44,809 --> 00:57:46,201
with the supposed problem

1131
00:57:46,245 --> 00:57:48,465
with the campaign finances,
didn't you?

1132
00:57:48,508 --> 00:57:51,076
You would tell them anything
to hurt miss Lacey --

1133
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,861
to get her out of your life,
to get her out of the way.

1134
00:57:53,905 --> 00:57:56,168
Objection!
Sustained.

1135
00:57:58,083 --> 00:58:00,999
Your honor, I'd like
to introduce into evidence

1136
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:03,958
this canceled check
as an exhibit.

1137
00:58:04,002 --> 00:58:05,177
Objection.

1138
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:07,222
My client just found this
in her records.

1139
00:58:08,006 --> 00:58:10,661
It's a loan for $21,000.

1140
00:58:10,704 --> 00:58:12,576
Your honor,
this cannot be admitted.

1141
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:14,055
Overruled.

1142
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:16,797
Now, once again,
Mrs. Morgan,

1143
00:58:16,841 --> 00:58:20,888
did you ever hear sander Morgan
accusing Dana Lacey

1144
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:24,675
of misappropriating funds
from his campaign?

1145
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:27,852
No.

1146
00:58:30,115 --> 00:58:33,553
No further questions.

1147
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:36,121
Mr. Tamarin, redirect?

1148
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:41,561
Yes, your honor.

1149
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:48,568
I understand
how difficult it is

1150
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:51,963
to talk about
something so personal

1151
00:58:52,006 --> 00:58:55,357
in such a public forum,
Mrs. Morgan.

1152
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:02,277
When you first found out
about your husband's affair,

1153
00:59:02,321 --> 00:59:04,279
what did you say to him?

1154
00:59:07,108 --> 00:59:09,284
That I still loved him.

1155
00:59:09,328 --> 00:59:12,766
That, um...

1156
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:15,856
That I would fight
with everything I had

1157
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:19,120
to save our family --
to save our marriage.

1158
00:59:21,949 --> 00:59:23,124
All right.

1159
00:59:23,168 --> 00:59:25,474
So what did you do
to save your marriage?

1160
00:59:25,518 --> 00:59:28,303
I called Dr. Morgan.

1161
00:59:28,347 --> 00:59:30,088
Why?

1162
00:59:30,131 --> 00:59:33,091
Well,
because he had, um...

1163
00:59:33,134 --> 00:59:35,876
He had always been
so supportive of our marriage.

1164
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,749
He was more like a father to me
than a father-in-law.

1165
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:41,099
And what did he do?

1166
00:59:41,142 --> 00:59:44,406
He was furious.

1167
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:48,106
He came over.
He sat William down.

1168
00:59:48,149 --> 00:59:51,152
He said the morgans
believed in family --

1169
00:59:51,196 --> 00:59:52,458
objection --

1170
00:59:52,501 --> 00:59:54,112
hearsay.

1171
00:59:54,155 --> 00:59:54,982
I will allow it.

1172
00:59:57,158 --> 00:59:59,334
If William divorced me,

1173
00:59:59,378 --> 01:00:04,122
sander would write him
out of the will completely.

1174
01:00:04,165 --> 01:00:05,514
Objection, your honor!

1175
01:00:05,558 --> 01:00:07,125
Objection -- hearsay!

1176
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:08,866
Overruled.

1177
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:12,086
If there are any further
outbursts in this courtroom,

1178
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:13,479
I will clear the court.

1179
01:00:13,522 --> 01:00:14,915
Proceed, Mr. Tamarin.

1180
01:00:14,959 --> 01:00:17,265
Mrs. Morgan,
exactly how much money

1181
01:00:17,309 --> 01:00:20,747
did your husband stand to lose
if the will was changed?

1182
01:00:26,144 --> 01:00:27,754
$15 million.

1183
01:00:32,411 --> 01:00:37,764
Carter: And did sander
ever change his will?

1184
01:00:37,808 --> 01:00:39,940
No. He was murdered.

1185
01:00:39,984 --> 01:00:42,116
Isn't that convenient --

1186
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,945
before miss Lacey
could lose out on $15 million!

1187
01:00:44,989 --> 01:00:46,077
Objection, your honor!

1188
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,775
The d.A. Is not practicing
estate law!

1189
01:00:48,819 --> 01:00:49,950
Move to strike.

1190
01:00:49,994 --> 01:00:50,951
Sustained.

1191
01:00:50,995 --> 01:00:54,085
I'm a little confused.

1192
01:00:54,128 --> 01:00:56,087
Uh...

1193
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:57,915
Since sander died

1194
01:00:57,958 --> 01:01:01,832
before he had a chance
to change his will,

1195
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:04,008
what would happen now

1196
01:01:04,051 --> 01:01:10,492
if William were to divorce you
and marry Dana Lacey?

1197
01:01:10,536 --> 01:01:12,973
If they married...

1198
01:01:13,017 --> 01:01:16,411
Dana Lacey would be
$15 million richer.

1199
01:01:21,112 --> 01:01:23,070
No further questions,
your honor.

1200
01:01:23,114 --> 01:01:24,681
The witness is excused.

1201
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:35,300
How could you not tell me
about the will?!

1202
01:01:35,343 --> 01:01:37,650
Michael: It isn't true.
She's lying.

1203
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:40,305
Sander never threatened
to change the will.

1204
01:01:40,348 --> 01:01:43,395
Well, you know what --
I don't believe you!

1205
01:01:43,438 --> 01:01:45,527
I was completely unprepared!

1206
01:01:45,571 --> 01:01:49,053
I walked into a trap because
you weren't straight with me!

1207
01:01:49,096 --> 01:01:51,055
I hope to god
you didkill sander,

1208
01:01:51,098 --> 01:01:53,405
because then I won't
feel so bad when we lose.

1209
01:01:53,448 --> 01:01:56,495
I didn't kill anybody.

1210
01:01:56,538 --> 01:01:59,367
How can I believe you?!

1211
01:01:59,411 --> 01:02:01,021
Huh?!

1212
01:02:01,065 --> 01:02:03,371
How can a jury believe you?!

1213
01:02:03,415 --> 01:02:06,113
Do you realize
what could happen to me?!

1214
01:02:06,157 --> 01:02:07,811
I don't think you understand

1215
01:02:07,854 --> 01:02:10,901
how far I'm putting myself
out there for you!

1216
01:02:10,944 --> 01:02:12,337
Lily...

1217
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,643
What?!

1218
01:02:14,687 --> 01:02:16,776
Of course, you realize,

1219
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,866
this means
Billy had motive, too.

1220
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:22,826
Yeah, but Billy's fingerprints
aren't on the knife.

1221
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:25,219
And Billy didn't witness
the murder.

1222
01:02:25,263 --> 01:02:27,482
At least
that's how you tell it.

1223
01:02:27,526 --> 01:02:30,094
And Billy is not the one
that's on trial!

1224
01:02:30,137 --> 01:02:31,530
[ Sighs ]

1225
01:02:31,573 --> 01:02:33,358
Damn!

1226
01:02:33,401 --> 01:02:35,577
The jury wants justice
for sander's murder,

1227
01:02:35,621 --> 01:02:38,493
and we just made it
easy for them!

1228
01:02:38,537 --> 01:02:40,539
That's right --

1229
01:02:40,582 --> 01:02:43,542
the state does intend
to press for the death penalty.

1230
01:02:43,585 --> 01:02:45,631
Sir?is that your strategy?

1231
01:02:45,674 --> 01:02:47,633
There they are!Miss Martin!

1232
01:02:47,676 --> 01:02:49,200
Do you still believe...

1233
01:02:49,243 --> 01:02:51,202
Lilian:
Not today. Not today!

1234
01:02:51,245 --> 01:02:54,118
What would you've done
with the $15 million?

1235
01:02:54,161 --> 01:02:57,730
Now, are you sure
you saw the car

1236
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,428
leaving Dr. Morgan's house
at 11:15?

1237
01:03:00,472 --> 01:03:01,908
Yes, ma'am.

1238
01:03:01,952 --> 01:03:03,736
