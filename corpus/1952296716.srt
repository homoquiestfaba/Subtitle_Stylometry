00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:58,815
IN MEMORY OF EARL J. LEE
DEAR HUSBAND AND FATHER

2
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,859
Hello, Etta.
I am your uncle Donnie.

3
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,520
The last time I saw
you were a baby.

4
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:06,188
And I'm your aunt Charlene.

5
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,892
Donnie is the brother of your dad,
rest in peace.

6
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,501
How would you feel if you and Pam
come and live with us

7
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,629
in the birthplace of your father?

8
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,496
How much do you weigh?

9
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,765
"You weight, what is?
I do not know. "Sixty-three kilos?

10
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,464
Let me see your stomach.

11
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,836
Do not do that.

12
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,216
Prove this for me.

13
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,485
Here comes Mama!

14
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,739
What will happen
when you turn this car?

15
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,309
- Nothing?
- Are you sure about that?

16
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,208
Because the circus is in town
and mother is as bad.

17
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:29,972
Okay.

18
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,711
That's my baby.

19
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,889
The circus is in town
and mother is as bad.

20
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:38,991
Watergate!

21
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:44,690
"I like that game.
"Yes, I know you like.

22
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,763
Well ...

23
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,695
Come, Bessie!

24
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,231
Oh, sorry!

25
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:04,913
Good Intentions

26
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,396
NUDE GIRLS
FULL BAR

27
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,864
What does "Shangri-La"?

28
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,301
It's a cute name for a brothel.

29
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,101
I want a brothel!

30
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,008
No honey, you want a "steed".

31
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,278
Help your brother
with the letter C.

32
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,145
Welcome to Myra, Georgia
Founded in 1886

33
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,117
Population 2214
Home of the cousin of Robert E. Lee

34
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,901
That's the dumbest
I've ever heard.

35
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,529
"You are the dumbest
I've heard.

36
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,165
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

37
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,175
Come on, boys.

38
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,814
Come here!
I'll give you change.

39
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,475
- I go first!
- No!

40
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,979
Do you have change for a dollar?

41
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,197
Shane!

42
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,704
God!
Children are out!

43
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,873
-Ches, I bought something.
"I thought we were saving.

44
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,144
Yes, but give me your shirt.

45
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,421
Do not you pay a discount.
I shall return.

46
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,082
The next time you need something,
just tell me to me.

47
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,888
I need something.

48
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,529
- What is that?
"They're fireworks.

49
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,428
Someone buy
all that can make

50
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,535
before Labor Day.

51
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,034
Should win
enough money at it.

52
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,799
How your last three plans?

53
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,168
I ...

54
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,299
Ches, how can we save money
for college ...

55
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:55,140
if whenever we have a little,
you blow it?

56
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,474
One of my inventions will succeed.

57
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,981
What if not?
What do we do?

58
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,848
Mommy! Help!

59
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,784
Mommy! Help!

60
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:09,252
"I thought you had settled.
"I managed ...

61
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,625
Vomiting in the car, I know.

62
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,888
- Come here!
- Hold on, son!

63
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,606
Come!
Yes!

64
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:35,044
- You hear that?
- The engine is running!

65
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,153
Man, can you hear those horses?

66
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,417
It is a "rush"!

67
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,126
These stallions
are crazy!

68
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,818
Chester! Come on!

69
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,862
- Turn that already!
- Out!

70
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,234
Hey. Kyle no longer talk much.

71
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,769
Honey, that's because he is man.

72
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,736
At first
talked all the time.

73
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,067
Now comes the work
and turn on the TV.

74
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,336
It remains a sweet,
but it is very quiet.

75
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,078
But does he still want ...?
you know.

76
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,912
Yes, all the time.

77
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,348
I think that you need to close the factory
fun for a while.

78
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,890
Let him know that the entrance
not free.

79
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,651
Pam ...

80
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,352
Pam!

81
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,690
He has to learn
to think outside of your box. "

82
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,033
Shane, stop struggling with
your brother broke his leg.

83
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,329
Shane! Chris!

84
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,031
Help your uncle Kyle
to fix their racecar.

85
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,605
Here is
my future race team.

86
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:30,834
Come here little weird.

87
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,877
Want to show you
to change tires

88
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,377
in less than 14 seconds?

89
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,538
Give me that.
Well.

90
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,040
Hey. "Shane?

91
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,877
Shane, bring your brother here
and return to fight.

92
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,317
But he breaks his leg.

93
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,250
Come on!

94
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,786
That's my race team!

95
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,060
"Ches?

96
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,531
Why sometimes is not enough
a woman loves a man?

97
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,464
What?

98
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,399
I mean, look at Pam.

99
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,063
Kyle goes to Shangri-La ...

100
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,033
- Again with this?
"But she loves him.

101
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,007
He also loves her. You know?

102
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:09,273
It's just that the words and stuff
is difficult for some men.

103
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:10,746
Simply do not know say so.

104
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,475
And why he goes to a bar
of naked women?

105
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,086
- Do you really want to know?
"Yes.

106
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:19,089
Well. I'll tell you.

107
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,955
I like sunset, right?

108
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,789
I know you like
because whenever I see you watching

109
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,420
and sometimes make you mourn.

110
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,394
Do you remember the mountains

111
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:33,369
Yellowstone
on our honeymoon?

112
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,168
Yes, they were amazing.

113
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,937
A French man discovered them,

114
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,410
and named "Grand Tetons".

115
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,447
- Do you know why?
- Why?

116
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,210
Because he thought were
most wonderful

117
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,613
I had ever seen.

118
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,381
You know what "Teton"
in French?

119
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,457
It means chest.

120
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,082
- Ah!
- What?

121
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,626
Can not name a mountain
Big Boobs.

122
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,662
-Look it up if you want.
"I will.

123
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,095
Good.

124
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:03,224
That's the issue. You see, when we
to those bars of naked women

125
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,701
we see nothing
that beautiful sunsets.

126
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,764
If I ever catch you
looking at a couple of sunsets

127
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:13,140
eclipse will be damned
longer than you've ever seen.

128
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,332
-Ches, are you asleep?
-No.

129
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,297
Ches.

130
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,595
I do not want to hear you talk more
team about your future career

131
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,499
with Kyle and children, right?

132
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,665
Well, I was just kidding.

133
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,503
Kids will love
race cars.

134
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,441
Besides, I am
new sponsor.

135
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:47,671
What?

136
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,441
Only until you can get
a carburetor.

137
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,845
Can you imagine?

138
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,111
"Inventions and Liquor Chester
on the hood of his car

139
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,754
across the line
the end of the race.

140
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,289
Chessy, he has never finished
a single damn race.

141
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,451
- Are you crazy?
-No. I'm not.

142
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,564
He is your future husband.
I believe in him.

143
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,098
And you're not alone.

144
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,798
What's wrong with being a mechanic?

145
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,633
Kyle is mechanical.

146
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,742
My dad was a mechanic.

147
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,400
The mechanics
do not go to college.

148
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,274
Your dad did not go to college.

149
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,008
And why is it so important?

150
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,378
My dad was a good man.

151
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,952
Yes, Ches, Dad
was a good man.

152
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,019
But he was poor.

153
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,350
And we
we barely survive.

154
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,592
We are robbing Peter
to pay Paul

155
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,593
I do not want children to have
to fight for every measly penny.

156
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,253
One of my inventions will be successful.

157
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,728
Oh, Ches! No.

158
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,163
Children ... the only way
children will have a better life

159
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,598
is if they receive a good education.

160
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,136
And not chasing a dream
impossible half-finished.

161
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,796
"A half-finished?
"A half-finished?

162
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,272
When did you see that I leave something
half-finished?

163
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:21,071
- What was that?
- Nothing!

164
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,706
"I can not find them.
"Keep looking.

165
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,210
Ah ...

166
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,313
I found them!

167
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,725
Can I prove it?

168
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:46,954
You are very young.

169
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,896
I would like if I touched or
until I was eight years.

170
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:04,614
Hello?

171
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,685
I got the bill of your materials
fireworks ...

172
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,980
"Ches?

173
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,351
What? I told him to send him here.

174
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,687
"$ 336? Are you crazy?

175
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,418
Etta in a week
will triple the money.

176
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,630
God!

177
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:33,311
Oh, boy!

178
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:47,818
Are the children well?

179
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,757
No thanks to your stupid
fireworks.

180
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,726
Ches, may have died.

181
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,931
At least we
insured by fire.

182
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,363
Not by this fire.

183
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,135
Make fireworks
is illegal in the State of Georgia.

184
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,828
Should arrest you, Chester.

185
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,133
Consider it a personal favor
I will not do.

186
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,371
I put green this time.
How nice, Chester.

187
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,410
Well, come on!
Fight the fire.

188
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,874
One of my inventions will succeed.

189
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:48,610
Whenever we have a little,
you ... squandered it.

190
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:55,992
Good evening.

191
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,501
- Do not move!
- Ay!

192
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,705
Do not shoot me please, sir.
I have kids.

193
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,465
Put the money in the bag.

194
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,588
Please call 911.

195
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,094
The sheriff has just gone
Liquor to Chester.

196
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,995
Can you tell me your name, sir?

197
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,167
Sir?

198
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,766
Sorry about your door, Chester.

199
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,701
Hey, SWAT team.

200
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,668
He is gone. Oh ...

201
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,346
"They just rob me.
- Ches!

202
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,923
No!

203
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,052
Yes, the son of a bitch
was $ 200.

204
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:10,886
But ...

205
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,166
It will not happen again.

206
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,809
Who would want to shoot today?

207
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,506
I will not shoot anyone, Bo.

208
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:34,745
Looking for more ...
a deterrent.

209
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,548
Shooting is a deterrent.

210
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,283
It is the best deterrent there is.

211
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,825
It really has
many nice things.

212
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,657
Thank you, ma'am.

213
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,063
And how its value rises over time
how they do in the program?

214
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,828
If you know what to buy.

215
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:55,065
These two me
I look very similar.

216
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,970
Why this comes so much more?

217
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,805
Mainly it is for your state.

218
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,038
Honestly, every time
I'm leaning more

219
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,342
to sell these pieces
Internet.

220
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,617
Twelve-gauge shotgun.

221
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,811
Pumping action.

222
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,388
Once you put
the cartridge into the chamber,

223
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,083
soar alone.

224
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,486
Pow!

225
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,624
Here you go.

226
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,596
Still,
thousand dollars is a lot of money.

227
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,464
Would you accept 700 for it?

228
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,266
"For you?

229
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,738
They could be 800.

230
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,902
You sure are generous.

231
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,911
I saw this in
The traveling exhibition.

232
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,448
Did you ever handle a gun?

233
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,281
I can not say yes.

234
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,949
Meet me in the lagoon.

235
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,617
Come on.

236
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,720
Have you ever been restored?

237
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,799
No, ma'am.

238
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,958
Because restoring damaged ...

239
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,865
... the value of the piece.

240
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,404
Although you knew that, obvious.

241
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,833
High, high, high ...!

242
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,442
When did you steal a deer
liquor store?

243
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,137
Not often. Well.

244
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,078
Underpins the fat, right?

245
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:15,084
Aim to half of the body,
well have much margin for error.

246
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,482
Forward.

247
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,918
This is a big investment.
Very big.

248
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,652
If an investment
should take into account

249
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:26,753
higher status
This piece from here.

250
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,200
Oh no! No. ..
take this $ 800.

251
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,298
800 then.

252
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,100
Yes, but did not tell
Chester about this.

253
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:39,574
"It's a surprise.
"Yes, I would.

254
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,250
Hell, Ches.
I shot ... me.

255
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,547
Nobody shoots the target of Bo.

256
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,182
Give me the gun.

257
00:19:55,861 --> 00:20:00,321
I'm afraid, honestly,

258
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,558
I can not sell
a firearm.

259
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,396
What?

260
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,234
How?

261
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,347
Hi, sweetie, what's this?

262
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,422
It is an antique table of rosewood.
Is not it beautiful?

263
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,422
Yes, where did he come from?

264
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,388
"From Uncle Jeffrey.
- A gift?

265
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,655
No. He died.

266
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,997
What was Jeff?

267
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,133
You met him last summer.

268
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,834
Do not think I've ever known.

269
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,094
Yes, I knew.
You liking it very much.

270
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,968
There seem to be very sad
respect.

271
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,440
Because he was sick
for long.

272
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,307
It was rather a relief.

273
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,971
Cancer?

274
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,673
- What?
-Jeffrey.

275
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,341
Yes .. yes.

276
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,248
Yes

277
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,026
Today I stopped by the store Bo.

278
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,598
Ches, no!

279
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,359
He wanted to buy a shotgun.
But I wanted it to sell.

280
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,105
Good. We have two children
they need their father

281
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:19,400
much more than $ 800
that guy took.

282
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,707
Who said it was $ 800?

283
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,382
I told you 200 because
I did not want you to worry.

284
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:29,476
Ches! You said 800.
Now, eat.

285
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:31,788
I'll attend.

286
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,397
"Etta Milford?

287
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:46,402
You are under arrest.

288
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,835
I love doing that.

289
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,543
- Ches's at home?
"Here, Ernie.

290
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,479
"By chance
not have one of those ...

291
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,745
... you took brownies
the baseball tournament for children?

292
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,912
There was not one, Ernie.

293
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,082
Here are some fresh
in the pantry.

294
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,463
Do you hide evidence?

295
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,233
I can not hide anything, Ernie.

296
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,577
- What is that?
"My first million.

297
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,352
It looks like a Swiss Army knife.

298
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,681
Yes, but have you ever seen
a Swiss Army knife with light?

299
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,126
"Yes.
- Really?

300
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,587
All the time.

301
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:53,336
"Hi, honey.
"Hello, beautiful. Come here.

302
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,303
Can I get you some dessert?

303
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,771
Depends on what you have.

304
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,498
Well ...

305
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,870
Apple pie warm.

306
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,708
Chocolate cake.

307
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,508
Fruit salad.

308
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,323
But I think the fruit cake
is better.

309
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,219
Yes, I think I'll try the cake.

310
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,518
You should get very good tips.

311
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,126
Shut up, Ches.

312
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,721
"The usual?

313
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,165
No, I will eat fruit salad.

314
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,666
Then you bring.

315
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,562
Thanks, honey.

316
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,002
Who's minding the store?

317
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,701
I'm trying something new ...

318
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,879
Why spend
much money on this?

319
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:49,016
No one runs to over 30 km
per hour in this desolate town.

320
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,789
Why does it always
both yearn to fines?

321
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,225
In villages like this,

322
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,833
most likely
is that it is someone you know.

323
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:59,095
And only means that another person
will think you're an idiot.

324
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,496
Do people think I'm an idiot?

325
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,506
Do not know. Everybody thinks
the others are idiots.

326
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,441
But when you're
new in town,

327
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,706
no sense
start with the left foot.

328
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,873
Let them be.

329
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,744
But we're cops.

330
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:20,015
I think you concentrate
much of it.

331
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,318
We have one.

332
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,624
Yes!

333
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:30,064
35. A new record.

334
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,526
Turn it on.

335
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,489
I brought you your favorite, enjoy it.

336
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:01,826
Wrecked car.

337
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,662
No.

338
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,835
It makes no sense to spend
five dollars in the restaurant

339
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:10,305
when your beloved wife can
prepare the same for a dollar.

340
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,807
Let me ask you something.

341
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,241
Cents ...
Do you cry when you play?

342
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,472
Every little bit helps.
Now, eat.

343
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:22,417
Hey ... Ernie said what?

344
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:24,454
He suspects the man who opened
The new thrift shop.

345
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,986
"The Old Curiosity Shop?

346
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:30,325
Since moving here. Boom!
I steal, "as well?

347
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,657
But I know how to recover the money.

348
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,270
Machine nutcracker with
best players in Atlanta Braves.

349
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:48,411
Braves most popular players,
honor of the region, do you follow?

350
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,344
Which players?

351
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,710
Not sure yet.

352
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,750
Not even wears the uniform
Braves team.

353
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,445
It is a work in progress. Eh ...

354
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:57,612
Voila!

355
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:58,745
The pecan.

356
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,324
"State number one
producer of pecans?

357
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,450
-Georgia.
"You're joking.

358
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,289
No, no. This is good. See?
This is good.

359
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,626
Of course, it is assumed that now
should break the shell ...

360
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,794
... but this is only a prototype.

361
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,097
- Did you do this?
"Yes.

362
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:16,833
And a gentleman in Atlanta

363
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:20,274
told me to do a lot more
extent that they can do well.

364
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,610
- How much will it cost?
"Only $ 11 each.

365
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,150
If I could get a hundred ...

366
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,947
"$ 1100?

367
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,817
- Are you paid for?
"I paid him.

368
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,652
I still have no money.
It is not Labor Day.

369
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,020
Chester!

370
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,220
No desperdiciarás
our money on this!

371
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,093
A waste?

372
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:42,722
This is me.

373
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,801
You know.
I am not this.

374
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,231
Is the liquor store?
It's not what I like.

375
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,203
You know.
I always knew.

376
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,935
No. That's me.

377
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,101
I can feel it.

378
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,465
Come here.
What does that say?

379
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:20,127
-Pan.
"Go and bring a bit of your mother.

380
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,137
Hello.

381
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:26,573
The table that I sold.
Have you served us well?

382
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:30,477
You do not hear that.

383
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:39,851
It's in my hall, aging
and becoming more valuable every day.

384
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,016
I have some new parts
new arrivals

385
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,889
if you want to go to see them.

386
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,595
I was bottoming
after this table.

387
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,135
Well, I have almost no space.

388
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,363
Perhaps it will sell all
a colleague in Savannah

389
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,768
at a discount price.

390
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,137
It was great to see.

391
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,022
Why is looking like that?

392
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,892
Son, your mother is
a very beautiful woman.

393
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,196
That's their way
make me a compliment.

394
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,497
You can do that sort of thing

395
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,368
when you charge less
than other markets.

396
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:31,541
Of course, if it were not so ...

397
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,166
would be considered inappropriate.

398
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,573
Is not it true, Mr. Simmons?

399
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:38,249
Very beautiful.

400
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,851
I want to be like him when I grow up.

401
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,583
- A chef or an elf?
"I'll be a fireman.

402
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,157
Yes?

403
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,390
How about fire chief?

404
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,993
You know, if you study
and receive a good education,

405
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,570
can be anything you want.

406
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:04,835
You can have things and do things ...
Dad and I never had.

407
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:08,742
Hey ... go to the living room
watching television.

408
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,745
Did you find this chair
at a flea market?

409
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:11,906
Years ago, yes.

410
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,412
Remember how much you paid for it?

411
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,175
Five dollars, maybe.

412
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,821
- How much do they worth today?
"No idea.

413
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:23,050
I think I would
about a thousand dollars.

414
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:26,923
Damn!
How beautiful surroundings.

415
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,725
Why you can not do that?

416
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,503
Wow, this is a beautiful piece.

417
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:36,232
"Surely yes.
- What?

418
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,774
- Huh?
- Huh?

419
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,845
You sure can not be interested
in that chair Windsor?

420
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,138
It is the 19th century.

421
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,045
Again try to sell me
expensive parts.

422
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,209
All I can do
is buy this.

423
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,911
I'll take it.

424
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,715
Well, you can take it.

425
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:52,981
Can reservármela?

426
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,786
Why should I go for cash.

427
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:05,269
"I can read the future.
- Predict the Future?

428
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,300
Yes, I have ways.

429
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:10,599
In fact, I know
where will you go in an hour.

430
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:11,866
Where will I go?

431
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,306
I think you'll

432
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:17,312
in the back seat
my Cruiser, handcuffed.

433
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,349
You're bad!

434
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,452
No idea how you see.

435
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:30,925
Always be
where to find you, Ernie.

436
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,989
I want a pint
pieces of chocolate, please.

437
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,603
"Today you are your own?

438
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:45,607
No, I have to watch Rob Buck
Chester store now.

439
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:49,474
I think we would have more crime
if we had more laws.

440
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,775
You understand what I mean?

441
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:58,453
Ernie, how are you
your wife ... Angela?

442
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,625
She is fine,
thanks for asking.

443
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,254
Well.
I guess I'll see later.

444
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:12,263
"Have a nice day, ma'am.
Good-bye.

445
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,014
Hi, guys.

446
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,346
Who is hungry?
Here you go.

447
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,887
Backwards. Come on.
Come and eat.

448
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,958
Mama needs a new chair.

449
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,526
There is plenty for everyone.

450
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:49,331
"Buck? Are you there?

451
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:50,964
We have a 3-8-7
in progress

452
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,168
Twelve on the road!

453
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,710
"3-8-7?

454
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,314
Goats in the middle of the road.

455
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:10,022
Could you leave that
and come help?

456
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,188
My God, we
a bloody stampede! Come on!

457
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,241
Are you serious?

458
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:34,209
You know that another liquor store
in the next town?

459
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:42,723
20, 40, 60, 70 ...

460
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,954
Is that new?

461
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,063
Yes

462
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,859
110, 15 ...

463
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,533
If you do a habit of this

464
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,232
Will you buy a rope?

465
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,843
This thing hurts.

466
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:05,947
Ah!

467
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,348
- Ah! Here comes the train.
- Ah, Earl!

468
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,044
Here comes the train.

469
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,088
I can hear the whistle!

470
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,783
Calling all cars, there
liquor store robbery in Chester.

471
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,019
Please respond immediately.

472
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:19,620
Damn!

473
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:24,226
"Like I'll bring the beers, huh?

474
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,497
I do not want the other junk.
This time I want Bud.

475
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,034
Shaping in the area
excess in the hips ...

476
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,039
- What are you looking at?
- See that?

477
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,110
This woman invented
a pair of nylon stockings

478
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,973
That make the rear
That woman looks like a peach!

479
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:42,150
God! For me
it looks great.

480
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,547
Agreed.

481
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:50,423
Well, what aspect
had a criminal?

482
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,722
What was he like?
Plump, with mask and gun.

483
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,628
Did you see anyone out there
with that description?

484
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,530
Hey, son.

485
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,659
I did not steal.
Do not be angry with me.

486
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,405
Ernie, is the second time!
What the hell happened ...

487
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,304
I just got out of a situation
dangerous to come to assist you.

488
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,569
What happened?
"Was actually a squirrel?

489
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,643
I think we forget
who you're talking.

490
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,875
No, I know exactly
with whom I speak.

491
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,577
I know by the chocolate sauce
on your lips, constable.

492
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:25,428
Whatever. We ...

493
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,123
... catch this bastard.

494
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,002
"I must get some Bud.
"You do not drink Bud beer brand.

495
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:36,406
I guess this is
a good time to start.

496
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,842
You put on your account?
Or do you pay now?

497
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,535
For any other strange thing ...
you know, call me.

498
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,279
I had a strange conversation
with Kyle last night.

499
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:57,019
Closing the plant
fun, right?

500
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:01,530
Yes, Chester said that you had
furniture inherited recently.

501
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:02,928
Did he say that?

502
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:08,802
Apparently Yes your relatives
are dropping like flies.

503
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,101
I mean who are my relatives.

504
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,733
And I'd never heard of them.

505
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,675
I had that chair
in the basement for centuries.

506
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,178
Sure.

507
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,748
And that table?

508
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,613
Someone I know
is very curious this morning.

509
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:24,550
Etta! I saw that chair in the shop
Zachary last week.

510
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,247
I'm sure it's
common design.

511
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,882
No, no. It was this! One day I took
food and bumped into her.

512
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,018
The tag said $ 1,500.

513
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:35,027
I almost had a heart attack. I figured
he would make me pay for it.

514
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,133
Was it not so?

515
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,791
I knew it. I knew it.
I knew it!

516
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,027
Where did you get so much money?

517
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,139
"I took a loan.
- Who?

518
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,307
The store.

519
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,177
Chester would not allow that.

520
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:54,244
Oh, my God.

521
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,477
My God. God ...

522
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,609
No! There is not, above.

523
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,619
- Come on! Arriba!
- God, Etta!

524
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,884
You were stealing
to your own husband?

525
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,460
Will cross the floor
and you'll go straight to hell.

526
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:08,563
"No, I'm investing in your future!
- With a table and a chair?

527
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,394
"Until now.
- How now?

528
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,833
You can not think
to do it again!

529
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,201
I do not know! Still did not think well.
Okay?

530
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,329
Yes of course.

531
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,371
This last time
Chester really shocked.

532
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:29,177
God, now what?

533
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,686
What are you doing
a wolf in the car?

534
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,764
That is not a wolf.
It's a watchdog.

535
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,889
Honey, come and see.

536
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,627
We saw something similar
Yellowstone

537
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,964
and said he was a wolf.

538
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:48,469
The wolves are related
with dogs.

539
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,337
Some dogs
somewhat resemble the wolves.

540
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,305
So this too.

541
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,977
That thing
looks exactly like a wolf.

542
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,247
God!

543
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,144
Chris, Shane, Get away from there!

544
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:01,948
The next to the thief
Chester appears

545
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:04,554
will have a big surprise.

546
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,186
Should he take that thing to the store?

547
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:10,855
Yes

548
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,495
Why? Why eat
the thief before you eat?

549
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:18,659
The man who sold it to me
gave me a brochure with their orders.

550
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,133
Sure I'd like to see.

551
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:22,998
You are in the car.

552
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,900
My fault.

553
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,778
You may want to drop a note.

554
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,681
Hi, Uncle Kyle!

555
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,514
I did not know that your sister got married.

556
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:37,915
He never married.

557
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:41,582
I told them to call you uncle
to understand the hint.

558
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,185
Hey!
Uncle Kyle!

559
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,921
Shane, get down!
Shane, down!

560
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,629
It makes no sense
annoy Uncle Kyle

561
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,826
when he is doing something
who knows he should not.

562
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,667
There is nothing wrong
a bit of harmless fun.

563
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:58,474
Mr Simmons,
I'm raising a girl.

564
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,236
Please do not contradict
front of him.

565
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,440
Get in the car.

566
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,883
Stay here.
Right back.

567
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:19,893
I said, "I do not care, man.
I have a black cousin. "You know what?

568
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,790
They do not understand anything.

569
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,169
What the hell?

570
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,247
Yes, dear, yes, honey!
Load and shoot!

571
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,017
- Stop!
- What the hell are you doing?

572
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,720
I can not speak, Buck.
I'm busy.

573
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:48,450
Hello, Etta. I did not know it was you.
See you later.

574
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,260
Will let you do that?

575
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,054
Is Etta Milford.

576
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,860
When you were here
longer understand it.

577
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:10,407
Just stay behind
that line there.

578
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:11,537
Are you sure?

579
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,080
I do it every day.

580
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,311
Sitzen Sie!

581
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,217
That is supposed to calm,
but I think what makes her angry.

582
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,846
Do you have a name?

583
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,819
I've been calling
"Shut the snout.

584
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,459
Shut the mouth!

585
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,493
"It's therapeutic, right?
"Something like that.

586
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,436
Pasa and find what you want.

587
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,037
There are pig ...

588
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:36,332
"Okay. Bye.
"Goodbye.

589
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:41,673
Hey, I'll have no customers
if you keep barking like this.

590
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,931
I do not earn much money.

591
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:14,843
Pam is the only thing I
that really matters in this world.

592
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:17,971
All the money you would spend
I have to spend it on this.

593
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,508
And strippers.

594
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,184
Who do you think you are?

595
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,722
Did you ever think
maybe not your duty

596
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,383
decide what is right
for everyone else?

597
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:33,463
She is my sister.

598
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:36,526
How funny.

599
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,897
You say it as if you were his mistress.

600
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:20,069
"I do not like.
"For this is good for you.

601
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,510
Very beautiful.

602
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:34,251
Here you go.

603
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,293
Trouble in paradise?

604
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:44,094
Some types just want to be
freer than others.

605
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,601
Kyle needs a little help
to be driven to the corral.

606
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,566
So talking about me
before getting married?

607
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,970
Chester, you were born in the barnyard.

608
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:02,047
Hey, Bo. What happened?

609
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,312
Zachary happened.

610
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,046
I rented the place.

611
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,679
"Temporarily".

612
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,452
Yes

613
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,220
Let's take it back.

614
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,990
What is all this?

615
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,621
The Santa's workshop.

616
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:18,735
Just ... this ...

617
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,133
... becomes this.

618
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,502
Zachary comes here every night
to work with the furniture.

619
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,303
Yes, he has become
a science.

620
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,475
So he fakes
selling antiques.

621
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:33,014
Yes, well ...

622
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:37,610
Can not say
I agree.

623
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:43,057
But ...
sells most on eBay.

624
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,184
You can sell anything
on eBay.

625
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:48,492
A guy tried to sell
his kidney on eBay.

626
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:49,826
- No!
"Yes.

627
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,525
He was not allowed.

628
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:58,005
- Ready?
- Countdown!

629
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,905
Three, two ...

630
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:03,044
- Arms!
- Yes!

631
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,942
Right there!
A little of this, a bit of that!

632
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,786
Right there! Come back here!
Right there!

633
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:15,055
Yeah, baby!
Right there!

634
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,250
Hey!

635
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,293
What the hell did you say?

636
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,919
What I said to whom?

637
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,691
Kyle.

638
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:24,630
Well, children. Come on.
Get in the house a minute, let's go.

639
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,201
So ready.

640
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,998
Go.
Finish in a minute.

641
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,265
What you earn
to threaten me and my boyfriend?

642
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:31,738
I would not say it was a threat.

643
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:35,174
Etta, he saved the money
to buy me a ring!

644
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,109
Yes, a ring Etta.

645
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,306
And you had to ruin everything.

646
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,577
I know he's going to that club.
Go to your boss.

647
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,651
Pam.

648
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,617
For once in your life,
Stay out of my life.

649
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,985
God knows we already have enough
issues assailing Chester.

650
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,115
"You should watch what they say ...
- You know what?

651
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:52,751
The best thing that could happen is
someone was listening to this.

652
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,609
- How did I do?
"Six miles per hour.

653
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,617
Improving this, braggart.

654
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:18,679
Let me show you how.

655
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,084
"Come on.
- Ready?

656
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:28,565
Yes!

657
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:33,392
- Yes! How did you like that?
- Is this what they do?

658
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,028
Sometimes.

659
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:40,099
Am I eligible?

660
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:41,677
Place your bets.

661
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,784
Hey!

662
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:56,755
Etta!
Just who he wanted to see.

663
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,293
Hear, hear!

664
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,863
- What is the rush?
"Things to do.

665
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:04,263
Are you too busy
to see the business of your life?

666
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:06,096
"Yes.
"As you wish, but what the hell?

667
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:09,933
You're here, I'm here,
We have good things there.

668
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:10,938
Come on.

669
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,908
"Do not take long, come on!
"Okay.

670
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:19,380
Is this your first time.

671
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:23,011
When was the last time
you did calibrate it?

672
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:27,689
And where are the business
of which I spoke?

673
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:31,090
Ah! I sold them.

674
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,355
- So fast?
"Yes, ma'am.

675
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:36,762
Okay. Gotta go.

676
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,367
No, wait.

677
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:40,470
Just ... Wait!

678
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:42,906
I was just about to close.

679
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,736
Can I offer you a tour?

680
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:49,536
Could you show the details
antiques business?

681
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:55,514
I have an idea of the details
of which you speak and no thanks.

682
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:56,878
Wait, wait. Come on.

683
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,854
Never give him a chance
for no man.

684
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,223
God!
Go!

685
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,368
That's not right.

686
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,315
"Stay here.
"I will go to see what happens. Please?

687
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:54,702
We're closed!

688
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:01,651
Blow me down!

689
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:03,252
Lipstick.

690
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,155
Now yes, friend!

691
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:19,300
Let me show you what happens
the next time your armed robber

692
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:20,801
try to steal.

693
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,504
This is robbery!

694
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:35,584
Put all your money
in my stocking.

695
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,980
Did not you hear?
I said you put all the money ...

696
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,784
In half my fucking filthy!

697
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:49,294
Unless you put your money on my half
I'll shoot you in the face!

698
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:52,768
Sorry, sir. This transaction
can not be processed

699
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:56,202
this protective armor
I installed.

700
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,807
Thank you very much.
How are you, Sheriff?

701
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,909
Kyle, hello.

702
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,270
A hole?

703
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:09,751
If you are busy,
back later.

704
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:12,478
No, Kyle is preparing single
to remove the glass.

705
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,523
Must speak for a second.

706
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:17,593
What, Ernie?

707
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,196
Well ...

708
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,025
We know
long ...

709
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:23,359
Yes

710
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:24,858
Well ...

711
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:29,704
Last night I saw something ...

712
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,000
What?

713
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,733
"Bubis?

714
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:35,174
Did you see boobies, man?

715
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:36,677
"Good?

716
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:39,675
Zachary!

717
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:41,579
He is not here.

718
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:43,049
What are you doing here?

719
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:45,677
The last time I was drunk
I promised Zach

720
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:47,187
would look after his shop.

721
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:49,087
Drunken Promises stink.

722
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:50,551
Where is he?

723
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,285
Do not know.

724
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,795
"But I'll tell you spent.
"No, no, no.

725
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:57,433
Ouch!

726
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,837
It is an antique table of rosewood.
Is not it beautiful?

727
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,064
God!

728
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,938
Security guard Zachary
a good record of everything, right?

729
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:12,772
Yes, my friend.

730
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:23,225
It is extremely
flammable, Ches.

731
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:30,491
Okay.
I do not do it again.

732
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,001
I told you not like!

733
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,504
I will go for adhesive bandages.

734
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:41,408
We need to talk.

735
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,408
- Can you wait?
- Are you going to bed with Zachary?

736
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,448
- What?
- Answer me!

737
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:50,075
-Ches, children are upstairs.
- That's not the right answer!

738
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,711
No, I'm going to bed
with Zachary.

739
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:54,289
Ernie says he saw last night.

740
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,392
"Ernie says?

741
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,128
I went to ask
on some antiques.

742
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,129
Turns out he was interested
in a couple of different boxes

743
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:03,254
and gave him a slap.

744
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,365
That's what I saw Ernie.

745
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,369
I stopped by his shop this afternoon,
And guess what I discovered?

746
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,904
Expand Cart.

747
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,476
One of a table, a chair.

748
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,736
No uncle Jeffrey,
and no cousin Jake!

749
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:19,542
You complain all the damn day:
"We have to save money,"

750
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,947
and sales to buy furniture
do not need.

751
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:26,419
No, not furniture, Ches.
They are investments.

752
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:29,184
Yes, I saw on TV
people have antiques

753
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:30,793
who think they are worthless

754
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:33,020
and end up being worth
thousands of dollars!

755
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:34,187
This crap does not.

756
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,629
Yes, Ches, look!
This is the 18th century.

757
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,561
I have a book with a photo

758
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,432
exactly like a table
in a museum.

759
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,969
Then, when we need
money for college

760
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:45,096
We sell!

761
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:47,574
It is like money in the bank
you can end up spending.

762
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,770
It's safe.
These things are becoming more valuable.

763
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:53,314
- These are copies, Etta!
"Of course not.

764
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:54,883
Watch this.

765
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:58,510
Queen Anne Chair
crafted in 1920 with ...

766
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:00,714
I went to his workshop.

767
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:04,190
Our television
is older than that chair!

768
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,825
Why I do this?

769
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:16,973
I do not understand how to raise the money
to buy to get started.

770
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,836
It costs us survive
in the situation we are.

771
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:22,205
On top of this maniac
It's stealing, and you ...

772
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,444
No!

773
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,644
Oh no!

774
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:32,946
I'm sorry, Ches.

775
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,255
Do you stole from me?

776
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:40,159
No, I stole for us,
by children.

777
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,384
Where are we going?

778
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,544
To request a refund.

779
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,301
Good afternoon, Etta.

780
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:25,764
You do not seem the type murderer.

781
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:29,508
How could you deceive me?

782
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,477
What?

783
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,913
I tried to buy
truly ancient pieces.

784
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,608
But, no.
You wanted good prices.

785
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:40,280
From this damn program
TV, everyone is looking for money.

786
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:41,617
I had to sell
I make furniture

787
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:43,055
to maintain
the shop open.

788
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,158
That money was for my children.

789
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:48,929
Well, call the police.

790
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,664
You know what ...

791
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,427
... is the strangest thing.

792
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,538
You say you have little money.

793
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,074
But every time
they steal your husband,

794
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,110
you enter here full of cash.

795
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,542
We are the same, Etta.

796
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,207
I'm not saying that's wrong.

797
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,649
Perhaps the humble
inherit the earth,

798
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:15,815
but spend very badly waiting
all others die.

799
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,861
Thought so.

800
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:30,262
Do not make me angry, Etta.

801
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:37,903
These children ... suffer much
with a mother in prison.

802
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:45,844
You should do assess that weapon.

803
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:38,171
Wait here, kids.

804
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,994
May God bless the USA, my friend.

805
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,942
Hands up!

806
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:18,611
Now!

807
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,713
Dude, she's my favorite.

808
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:25,218
It's spectacular.

809
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:27,346
Look at her.

810
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,549
Damn!

811
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:31,193
What do you think, mate?

812
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:33,919
- Ay!
- Damn!

813
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:36,328
Here you go.

814
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:44,600
"Need help?

815
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:54,749
Where are we going?

816
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:56,784
- Did you see Thelma and Louise?
- Who are they?

817
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,888
Two robbers who jumped
on a cliff with the car.

818
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,785
That's the most stupid
I have ever heard.

819
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:04,383
Come quick!

820
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,527
I'm trying.
I'm very nervous ...

821
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:14,360
"Mom was very angry with you.
- Shut up!

822
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:16,299
- You shut up!
- Shut up!

823
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,871
- You shut up!
- Hey! I said shut up!

824
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:21,272
I said shut up. Ouch!

825
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:33,711
Hello?

826
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:44,791
Shane!

827
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:50,966
Is that your car?

828
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,410
Shane! Turn! Turn!

829
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,873
- Beware of the truck!
- Shane!

830
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:02,473
Mom!

831
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:05,846
Mom!

832
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:15,795
Dad!
Help!

833
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:25,540
Get in the truck.

834
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:27,973
Get in the van
now.

835
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:30,872
What the hell was that?

836
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:34,208
-Ches ...
- What did my kids in the car?

837
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:37,046
You know what could have happened?
They could have died!

838
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:39,883
- Etta!
- Etta?

839
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,055
Oh, no ...

840
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:44,383
My God.

841
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:49,092
- What is past?
"Chester, I ...

842
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:44,109
- I do not use that!
"That's all I found.

843
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,481
I use red.
I want my mommy.

844
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:50,252
Mother always knows
I use red!

845
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:09,266
I looked for you all night.

846
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:12,573
Damn, Etta!
You scared me so much.

847
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:15,544
God, Pam!

848
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:24,510
Sign in God.

849
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:31,917
And how are the kids?

850
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,598
As well as could be expected.

851
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,430
And Ches?

852
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:43,699
I think you should give
some space.

853
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:48,976
Etta ...

854
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:53,043
Etta, you were always so strong.

855
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:59,178
Maybe it's time to start
to have a little faith in people.

856
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:12,665
You know, I was there
the day that Dad died.

857
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:15,498
You were only a baby.

858
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:23,704
I promised
would never need anyone.

859
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:26,406
Never trust anyone.

860
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:29,814
That would take care of me and you alone,

861
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,747
and would receive a good education.

862
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,455
And then mom was ...

863
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,319
And I failed.

864
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,431
I did not study anything,

865
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:47,729
I did not care about me,
I did not care about you.

866
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,338
Hell, I did not care for anyone.

867
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:53,131
You have not failed!

868
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:58,346
Look ...

869
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,642
Dad died,

870
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:04,219
but, honey,
We are still here!

871
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,218
You can solve this.

872
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,858
Your family still loves you.

873
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:16,056
Even Kyle still loves you.

874
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,500
I punctured its tires.

875
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:22,035
Yes, I know.

876
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,476
Let's go to breakfast.

877
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:37,516
Row, Row Your Boat
Row, Row Your Boat

878
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,654
Gently down the river

879
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:41,222
- Gently!
- What?

880
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:43,587
- It gently, you said something else!
- Mom!

881
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:44,954
Shut up.

882
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:49,057
Hey!
What the hell you looking at?

883
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:50,187
Bitch.

884
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:54,125
Here you go.

885
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:55,563
Eat something.

886
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:57,371
Come.

887
01:02:57,507 --> 01:03:00,169
So if I'm good
Chester let me go home.

888
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:02,138
Yes, that's the plan.

889
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:05,441
Except that the same
will happen again.

890
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:08,015
"You start stealing again?

891
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:11,484
No! He spent all our money
in their crazy inventions

892
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,885
and children do not go to college
or have what they need.

893
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:15,889
O. ..

894
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:19,688
Or you, Miss,
give him a chance.

895
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:22,229
And you'll be proud of him.

896
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:30,705
I liked enough ...
that baseball nutcracker.

897
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:43,451
Eat your food.

898
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:45,713
Nothing you can do
about it now.

899
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:58,256
"Pam?

900
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:00,494
We will do business together.

901
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:06,141
No. You're crazy.

902
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:18,984
How is your ice cream?

903
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:23,615
Tell you what,
it feels great in my mouth.

904
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,994
Are they still open?

905
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:30,695
"Five more minutes.
- Can I use the bathroom?

906
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:34,631
Thanks!

907
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:44,844
- Want one?
"No, maybe not.

908
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:48,982
"Testing, one, two.
"I'll leave in an hour.

909
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:51,681
Yes?

910
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,431
How strange to see you here, Ernie.

911
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:08,770
I like ice cream.

912
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,363
Yes

913
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:12,940
Clear.

914
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,241
Good night!

915
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:29,154
I thought I could find you here.

916
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:32,051
I've never been here before.

917
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:34,253
Ernie, I need your help.

918
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:36,888
After what you did
Chester?

919
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,031
Why did you say
I was cheating?

920
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:46,270
This is not
my first rodeo, miss.

921
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:49,173
I saw what I saw.

922
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,873
And I heard what I heard.

923
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:54,915
Now for the first time in your life
you can help someone

924
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:56,177
you really need,

925
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:57,718
or we can do to force.

926
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:02,586
Looks like the force.

927
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,852
Because the circus is in town
and mother is as bad.

928
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:14,269
Ay.

929
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:15,665
I touched your hair, sorry.

930
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,205
Oh, yes!

931
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:20,935
You make me feel like a king.

932
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,939
I feel like a king!

933
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:28,011
Good job, Ernie!
Protects and provides your services!

934
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:32,246
Do not think you know
and the librarian, O'Neill!

935
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:40,591
Do not tell Angela, right?

936
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,562
No. No.

937
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:44,461
But this girl,

938
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,330
could do
for a few beers, Bud.

939
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:49,366
She really likes beer.

940
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,669
And not the only thing she likes.

941
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:54,036
Ernie.

942
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:56,211
I need your help.

943
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:31,838
I thought we could
paint here, in this way.

944
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:33,844
This does not seem right.

945
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:35,675
What?

946
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,046
We are police!

947
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:45,984
How do you feel now?

948
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:50,164
What can I do?

949
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,861
You paint.

950
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:00,333
Take care you, Picasso.

951
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:02,706
I will cover Time
from 7:00 in the morning.

952
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:22,196
... football.

953
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:23,992
Well, was it tight
and central player?

954
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:25,361
Yes!

955
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:27,560
I grew up ten minutes from here.

956
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:30,001
- Yes? That's great.
- Yes!

957
01:08:35,044 --> 01:08:36,534
This way behind.

958
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:40,410
- That is the helmet he used?
- Yes! Want to try it?

959
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:41,675
Maybe later.

960
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:50,517
Good morning, Buck!

961
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:54,755
Ernie said he could use
the computer.

962
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:56,956
What business do you have with Ernie?

963
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:01,901
After today, no more.

964
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,717
Thank you very much. Thank you.

965
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:20,913
Handled with care, beautiful.

966
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:22,045
Thank you.

967
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,051
Hi, how are you?

968
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,692
Stop at the side, please.

969
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,769
These prices are
absolutely incredible!

970
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:36,963
I do not know how you do it!

971
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:39,336
Me neither.

972
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:40,736
Hi, honey.

973
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:44,272
How young so considerate.

974
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:47,644
"You should take good care.
"That I do.

975
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,344
What is the problem, sheriff?

976
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:56,583
Violation of Section 23.32.31
Vehicle Code.

977
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:58,716
Bring a light off.
Registration and driver's license.

978
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,385
I take the mechanic
immediately.

979
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,588
Registration and driver's license,
please.

980
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:11,672
Hey! That's my table
fucking idiot!

981
01:10:11,807 --> 01:10:13,968
Oh no, fortunately there are more
where it came from that.

982
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:17,169
Okay, no problem.

983
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:22,442
- What? Wait, that's not mine.
"I see.

984
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:24,815
I suppose the fairy
of marijuana left it there?

985
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:26,012
It's oregano. Sniff it.

986
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:29,019
- It's oregano, sheriff! Sniff it!
"Get out of the car.

987
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:32,287
I do not smoke, and do not cook.

988
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,293
- You must be kidding!
"Hands behind ...

989
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,795
Entitled
to remain silent.

990
01:10:35,931 --> 01:10:37,626
Anything you say ...

991
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:39,358
What the hell is this?

992
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:42,868
Lord.
I say this very often.

993
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,667
Please.
Do not ruin the moment.

994
01:10:45,808 --> 01:10:46,433
Yes, sir.

995
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:48,133
Entitled
to remain silent.

996
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:50,811
Anything you say
can be used against you ...

997
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:52,413
Sheriff, things
that truck is mine.

998
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:54,345
These furnishings are from my shop!
Are taking my stuff!

999
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,710
Things that truck is mine!

1000
01:10:56,852 --> 01:11:00,185
How can be yours,
if they are in the truck of them?

1001
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:02,381
"Those things are mine.
-Lie.

1002
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:16,935
This is unacceptable, sheriff!
Am I entitled to a call!

1003
01:11:17,072 --> 01:11:19,939
"Yes, I will call.
"Wait.

1004
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:21,337
There are two empty cells.

1005
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:23,502
Why am I here
a guy naked?

1006
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:25,204
Come to papa.

1007
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,446
How is everything?

1008
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:29,847
I'm almost done scanning them.

1009
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:32,249
Well.
Let me know if you need help.

1010
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:33,412
Thanks, Ernie.

1011
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:34,453
Your welcome.

1012
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:36,558
Your friend, Zachary.

1013
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:38,751
It seems he is wanted
in four states.

1014
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:45,129
Mail fraud, fraud, theft,
assault, violence.

1015
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:46,525
Wow!

1016
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:48,226
Yes

1017
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:51,669
Of the worst sort has happened
for this town.

1018
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,968
And I caught it.

1019
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:58,639
It feels good
finally be the sheriff.

1020
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:02,444
Ernie, you're the sheriff.
"I know.

1021
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:05,044
So ...

1022
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:07,917
What's where Chester
led you on your anniversary?

1023
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:11,149
- Saranby?
-Saranby.

1024
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:14,885
Last night I saw in the closet ...

1025
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:17,396
... Angela's dress.

1026
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:20,900
And while I do not give
an excuse to use it.

1027
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:26,032
Yes I too have
some elegant clothes.

1028
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,405
I was somewhat adjusted

1029
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:31,843
but I suppose
that if I let the ice cream ...

1030
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:35,572
I think this
is a very good idea.

1031
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:39,812
"Yes, I know you think that.
"Yes ...

1032
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:02,970
Can we open them?
Can we open them?

1033
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:04,272
Do not know.
Do you think you can open them?

1034
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:05,937
I think so.
I think it's Christmas.

1035
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:11,417
Here are Shane, Chris and Mom.
Merry Christmas.

1036
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,282
Okay, guys, break your ...

1037
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:24,594
Merry Christmas,
received a hair dryer!

1038
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:28,366
Hey, that's my foot!

1039
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,475
Mom is here?

1040
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:42,012
"Go back to sleep.
"I thought I heard my mom.

1041
01:13:44,286 --> 01:13:46,720
She's not here.

1042
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:11,674
Sheriff!

1043
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:14,709
Do not make me go in there for you.

1044
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:18,517
Hello!

1045
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:26,556
You know? I have a cot there.
You could use it if you want.

1046
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:30,157
I'm fine.
I go to Atlanta.

1047
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,058
No, not going as well as you are

1048
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:34,567
I will take Miss Sunshine.
Why do not you join us?

1049
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:37,465
Okay, Ernie,
thanks anyway.

1050
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:40,900
I said calm down!

1051
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:43,238
I need to use
my pepper spray.

1052
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:45,573
There's a wasp! Ouch!

1053
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,720
Some people never learn.

1054
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:55,813
Ya, stop!

1055
01:14:57,659 --> 01:14:59,286
Hey, hey, Ernie! Him ..

1056
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:02,856
Yes

1057
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:05,155
I'll wait ...

1058
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:07,993
Are you okay?

1059
01:15:08,136 --> 01:15:10,195
I'll be fine.

1060
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:38,862
Hey, Etta, once you serve.

1061
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:43,534
Yeah, this is Chester.

1062
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:44,934
I are stealing again.

1063
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:47,904
Yes It's her.

1064
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,912
How you're eating dinner?
Ernie, dammit!

1065
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:57,684
Mr. Simmons brought this.

1066
01:15:57,819 --> 01:16:00,447
Thought you would need.

1067
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:03,084
This completes the entire game.

1068
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:05,559
We had a quiet day.

1069
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:10,222
But I will give some
hundred dollars.

1070
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:12,494
Do not.

1071
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:15,629
Okay.
Let's see what's in your wallet.

1072
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:17,204
Chester.

1073
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:22,473
You know
how stubborn I can be.

1074
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:24,806
And then start
to get ideas in my head.

1075
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:27,379
As steal all our money.

1076
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:30,277
I know that makes no sense.

1077
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:34,680
I always wanted to have children
more opportunities than us.

1078
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:38,217
Is not trusted
that I could?

1079
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:40,956
No.

1080
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:44,429
And that I was wrong.

1081
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:54,067
What? Take the money
was not enough,

1082
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:55,904
Did you have to steal
my nutcracker?

1083
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:01,707
I took him to Atlanta and I got together
the manufacturer of the speaker.

1084
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:07,121
The first batch of a hundred should
be ready next week.

1085
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:08,950
"The first batch?

1086
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:11,216
I ordered two.

1087
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:14,724
"200?

1088
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:16,091
Are you crazy? I ...

1089
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:19,257
I can not sell two hundred.
He did not even know if I can sell one.

1090
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:23,198
Well ... and sold.

1091
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:28,308
-A $ 21.50 on eBay.
- What?

1092
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:32,311
It says here
18 people auctioned.

1093
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:35,439
And not bad
to be a one-day auction.

1094
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:42,888
Costing $ 11 to make it,
earn just $ 10.

1095
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:45,152
$ 10.

1096
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:48,387
$ 10
200 nutcracker ...

1097
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,498
Two thousand dollars!

1098
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:55,092
And perhaps the beginning of our
saving for college.

1099
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:57,863
One of them succeeded.

1100
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:59,564
I did.

1101
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:02,404
Yes .. did.

1102
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,389
Now go home.

1103
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:24,363
I know there are a couple of kids
who miss their mother.

1104
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:31,800
Subtitles: Arigone

1105
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:35,465
As for this weapon, comes
of the Civil War era.

1106
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:39,546
Interestingly, very similar
the rifle that is believed

1107
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:43,879
that General Robert E. Lee
he gave Ulysses S. Grant

1108
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:46,351
at the end of the Civil War.

1109
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:49,821
Grant returned
many years later.

1110
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:52,017
Esperance but not much.

1111
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:55,253
Because this is not the rifle
Robert E. Lee,

1112
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,456
distinguished
by initials

1113
01:18:57,599 --> 01:18:59,863
recorded near the latch.

1114
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:03,300
Unfortunately, this rifle
was lost in history.

1115
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:05,463
Her whereabouts are unknown.

1116
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:08,201
Due to the excellent condition
his gun

1117
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:13,178
in an auction could be worth
between six and eight thousand dollars.

1118
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:17,615
However, if the weapon appeared
Lee in the auction,

1119
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:22,713
that figure is closer
a one million dollar.

1120
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:25,224
Wow! Great.
