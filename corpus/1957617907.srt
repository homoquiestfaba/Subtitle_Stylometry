(slow dramatic music)

00:00:26,952 --> 00:00:27,785
(slow guitar music)

00:00:27,786 --> 00:00:32,035
(men speaking in foreign language)

00:00:36,294 --> 00:00:39,461
(slow dramatic music)

(gun fires)
(slow dramatic music)

00:01:16,212 --> 00:01:18,816
(slow guitar music)

10
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:23,067
(men speaking in foreign language)

11
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:27,421
(slow dramatic music)

12
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:38,411
(slow guitar music)

13
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:49,169
(slow dramatic music)

14
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:22,532
(slow guitar music)

00:02:27,306 --> 00:02:30,473
(slow dramatic music)

16
00:02:35,094 --> 00:02:37,427
(gun fires)

17
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:52,011
- [Commander] All right, keep
your head and necks down.

18
00:02:52,012 --> 00:02:54,446
(gun fires)

19
00:02:54,447 --> 00:02:56,025
Keep them down!

20
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:58,985
(gun fires)

21
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:01,097
(slow guitar music)

22
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:05,348
(men speaking in foreign language)

23
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,979
- [Announcer] All right, men, listen up.

24
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,403
The training exercise, small
arms fire, 18:00 hours.

25
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,523
The first section, 18:00 hours.

26
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,257
All sections, all your
ordnance production reports

27
00:03:34,258 --> 00:03:37,336
to Colonel Sperry before
the end of the day.

28
00:03:37,337 --> 00:03:38,943
- Where are the clips?

29
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,690
- Worry later.

30
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,240
- Some more shell casings.

31
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,293
- Whoa there, come on.

32
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,869
There goes the sparks.

33
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:04,855
(quiet overlapping chattering)

34
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:08,295
(people speaking in foreign language)

35
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:12,046
(motorcycle engines revving)

36
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:23,024
- Go on.

37
00:04:27,822 --> 00:04:29,526
(slow dramatic music)

38
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:34,027
(people speaking in foreign language)

39
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:50,484
(women speaking in foreign language)

40
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:53,318
(women screaming)

41
00:04:58,044 --> 00:05:02,544
(people speaking in foreign language)

42
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:12,973
- You must be Gonzalez.

43
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,199
(Gonzalez speaking in foreign language)

44
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,693
- You filed a report
against us with the sheriff.

45
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,569
You even approached
the Farm Worker's Union

46
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,743
for help against this evil militia.

47
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,819
- One day, someone will bring justice

48
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,253
to this town, you'll see.
(women crying)

49
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,400
- You got guts.

50
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,423
You have got guts.

51
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,193
I admire your bravery,
Mr. Gonzalez, I truly do.

52
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:51,823
But I cannot condone this kind
of activity, you understand?

53
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,633
Shoot him.

54
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:57,368
(Gonzalez speaking in foreign language)

55
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:58,231
- No, please!

56
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,646
(group speaking in foreign language)

57
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:05,647
(gun fires)
(women screaming)

58
00:06:11,948 --> 00:06:12,850
- You live life weakly

59
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:15,943
if you cannot appreciate
the extermination of vermin.

60
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:24,705
(slow dramatic music)

61
00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:31,239
(woman speaking in foreign language)

62
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:37,338
(overlapping chattering)

63
00:06:46,002 --> 00:06:47,098
(door creaks)

64
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:48,258
- [Jose] They will kill us all.

65
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:49,429
- [Audience Member] Yeah,
you saw them, right?

66
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,699
We all saw them over here, right?

67
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,939
- [Hector] Hola, Pablo.

68
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,357
(overlapping chattering)

69
00:06:56,226 --> 00:06:59,919
- [Woman] Hector, Hector.
(speaking in foreign language)

70
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,437
- [Jose] There were no witnesses, huh?

71
00:07:02,438 --> 00:07:03,455
- [Audience Member] Yeah, witnesses.

72
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,477
- [Jose] Were there witnesses?

73
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:06,515
- We all saw them over here,
right, didn't you see them?

74
00:07:06,516 --> 00:07:07,349
I saw them.

75
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,932
- Who, who is going to testify?

76
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:14,735
That's what I thought.

77
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:15,761
- Well, what can we do?

78
00:07:15,762 --> 00:07:17,719
If we testify, they will kill us.

79
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,429
I don't want to die.

80
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,839
- He's right, remember Monte
Planto and his brother?

81
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,159
They went to the sheriff,
and the very next afternoon,

82
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,619
they were dead.

83
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,569
And now, now Gonzalez.
(overlapping chattering)

84
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,739
And before that, Jorge
Menendez was beaten so badly

85
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,393
that he could not ever walk again.

86
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:36,227
(overlapping chattering)

87
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:38,210
- Why don't we go to the
state police or the FBI?

88
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:40,079
(overlapping chattering)

89
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,699
- Really, amigo, then both
of us will get deported.

90
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,899
The sheriffs only keep us
around as long as we stay out

91
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,630
of trouble and as long as
we do the town's dirty work.

92
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:49,630
(overlapping chattering)

93
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,520
- Well, what are we going to do?

94
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:53,003
Are we gonna let them keep
killing us one by one?

95
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,369
(slow music)

96
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,020
- Then we must fight the militia.

97
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,369
- You are crazy, Hector, how?

98
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,693
We got no guns.

99
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,993
- Then we hire other killers.

100
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,046
We fight fire with fire.

101
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:16,047
(slow guitar music)
(quiet overlapping chattering)

102
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,219
- Like we really know people

103
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,470
who could stand a chance
against the militia.

104
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,653
- For hire. (speaking in foreign language)

105
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,530
You look good up here.

106
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,183
Green beret with trained mercenary team.

107
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,963
Expert skills, can handle any problem.

108
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,089
Contact Lieutenant William Fredrickson.

109
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,253
There's an address in Los
Angeles and no telephone number.

110
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,679
It's going to cost us plenty,

111
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,330
but it may be it's our last hope.

112
00:08:55,427 --> 00:08:57,159
(slow music continues)

113
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,933
- My brother is right.

114
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:02,663
If everyone chips in all
the money they can afford,

115
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,349
he and I will take the morning train

116
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,326
to Los Angeles to hire this man.

117
00:09:08,327 --> 00:09:12,744
(group speaking in foreign language)

118
00:09:15,526 --> 00:09:16,526
- Yeah.

119
00:09:18,054 --> 00:09:20,971
(train horn honks)

120
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:29,826
(slow guitar music)

121
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:44,972
(siren wails)
(overlapping chattering)

122
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:48,718
(helicopter wings whirring)

123
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,323
- Lieutenant Fredrickson?

124
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,893
- Uh, yeah, uh, have a seat.

125
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,976
Dad?

126
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:09,727
(toilet flushes)

127
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:15,879
- Damn.

128
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,393
- Lieutenant Fredrickson?

129
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,673
- You boys in from the deli?

130
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,803
- Senor, is this you?

131
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,903
- Yeah, could be.

132
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,020
Could be.

133
00:10:31,768 --> 00:10:34,042
Sit down, sit down, boys, tell me,

134
00:10:34,043 --> 00:10:37,407
tell me what I can do for
you, what do you want?

135
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,943
- We need you to help us fight a militia.

136
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:46,009
- There ain't no militias around here.

137
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,933
- No, not here, senor, in Texas.

138
00:10:50,695 --> 00:10:52,319
- How many are there?

139
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
- Over 100.

140
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,563
- Shit, is that all?

141
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:59,159
100, (laughs) they got a lot of firepower?

142
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,874
- Well, yes, senor.

143
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,159
- They have many guns.

144
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,777
- Yeah, sounds like you
boys got a little problem,

145
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:04,778
doesn't it?

146
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,773
I know all about the militias, I do.

147
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,069
I've been there, boys, I've been there.

148
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,923
They're scary and they get dangerous.

149
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,129
It's expensive, too,
how much money you got?

150
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,639
- Uh, how much is your fee?

151
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,769
- Fee? (stammers)

152
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,679
Anyway, it's more than you can afford.

153
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,235
- You don't know how much we got, senor.

154
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:33,210
- Don't make no difference.

155
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:34,860
Carmen will show you the way out.

156
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:38,854
Good, good luck, boys, yeah.

157
00:11:38,855 --> 00:11:41,729
(slow music)

158
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,689
You boys ever run into somebody out there

159
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,503
that smells like a dill pickle,

160
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,443
you tell him to get his ass in here fast.

161
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,375
Yeah.

162
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,610
Yeah.

163
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,599
- Wait, listen, listen, I have an idea.

164
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,049
There's this guy, his name is McQue.

165
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,419
I've never seen him before,
but I've heard about him

166
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,996
from guys who have come in here

167
00:12:08,997 --> 00:12:11,059
and he's supposed to be tough.

168
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,919
- Where can we find him?

169
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,759
- Well, he works at a motorcycle shop

170
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,450
about a block and a half away.

171
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:19,394
(Carmen sighs)

172
00:12:19,395 --> 00:12:20,395
Let me see.

173
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,559
First you have to go
over to Margaret's Diner.

174
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,783
It's over on Spring Street.

175
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,583
Here it is, okay, pencil, um.

176
00:12:32,595 --> 00:12:37,595
I don't have my pen,
lipstick, (laughs) okay.

177
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:42,794
(slow music)
(overlapping chattering)

178
00:12:56,134 --> 00:12:59,073
- [Man In Ball Cap] Two
blocks and make a right.

179
00:12:59,074 --> 00:13:00,574
- Okay, thank you.

180
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,503
- [Chef] Jerked fish on rye.

181
00:13:04,714 --> 00:13:06,414
- This looks like a drop-top Benz.

182
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:10,903
I can do that, a Dodge
Viper, cherry apple red.

183
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,939
I can do that, how much
you paying? (scoffs)

184
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,419
I can't do that, no, that's INGA,

185
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,993
it's not gonna happen.

186
00:13:19,994 --> 00:13:21,744
- Bueno, here we are.

187
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,220
What do we do now?

188
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,573
We don't even know what
this man looks like.

189
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,289
This is all your idea.

190
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,316
- My idea, no.

191
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:35,429
Who's the one who said, "Me
and my brother will go to LA"?

192
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,374
- We don't even belong here.

193
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,208
- [Waitress] More coffee here?

194
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,041
- Don't blame me.

195
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,849
- Maybe we should go back to Los Robles.

196
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,683
- Look, how was I supposed

197
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:43,579
to know this guy Fredrickson
was gonna be some kind

198
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,969
of alcoholic drunk, stupid, crazy nut?

199
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,258
- How can we talk to this McQue

200
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:50,058
when we can't even recognize him?

201
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:51,838
- Shut up, Jose. (background
noise drowns out speaker)

202
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,018
(slow dramatic music)

203
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:55,558
- Listen up and no one gets hurt.

204
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,701
- All right, everybody, put
your hands on the table.

205
00:13:57,702 --> 00:14:00,701
- Put your money and your
jewelry on the table.

206
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:03,060
Keep your hands in the air.

207
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:06,020
Put your money and your
jewelry on the table.

208
00:14:06,021 --> 00:14:08,959
(quiet overlapping chattering)

209
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,879
- Hands behind your heads.

210
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,139
All right, don't move.

211
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,569
Get your hands on the back of your head.

212
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,303
- Get down, right now.

213
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,373
Get them up.

214
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:20,230
- No.

215
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,230
- Hey.

216
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,457
What are you, deaf?

217
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,830
You, what are you, a tough guy, huh?

218
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,140
You think you're a tough guy?

219
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,139
- All the town's money's in those bags.

220
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,829
- Now, you listen to me,
if you don't shut up,

221
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,097
he's gonna hear you, he's gonna kill you,

222
00:14:44,098 --> 00:14:46,909
and if he doesn't kill you, I will.

223
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,543
- I said give up the cash.

224
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,603
Wallet, jewelry, rings,
everything you got.

225
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:58,158
- I don't mind you taking this stuff,

226
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:00,259
just leave the sunglasses.

227
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,610
- [Robber] What's so
special about the glasses?

228
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,789
- They're my favorite pair.

229
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,039
- Hey, boys, Johnny Webb
here has got an affection

230
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,777
for his sunglasses.

231
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:13,195
(gun clicks)

232
00:15:14,951 --> 00:15:16,719
Now you listen to me.

233
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,766
This gun's sticking in your ear,

234
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:19,249
and all I gotta do is pull the trigger,

235
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,623
and poof, no more tough guy.

236
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,703
- I don't care what you do,
just don't touch the glasses.

237
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:32,679
(people screaming)
(overlapping chattering)

238
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,013
(gun fires)

239
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:45,116
(dishes clattering)
(people screaming)

240
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,966
(glass shatters)

241
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:03,967
(wheels screeching)

242
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,350
- [Jose] I thought that was McQue.

243
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:09,788
- That's our man, whether
that was McQue or not.

244
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:10,847
- Come on.

245
00:16:10,848 --> 00:16:13,936
(slow music)

246
00:16:13,937 --> 00:16:16,687
(sirens wailing)

247
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,165
- GI Joe with kung fu grip, want a ride?

248
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,825
- I don't need a ride.

249
00:16:25,826 --> 00:16:30,826
- I think you need a ride.

250
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:39,826
(slow guitar music)

251
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:44,666
This is it?

252
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,823
Hey, yo.

253
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,939
Check it out-

254
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,522
(door rattles)

255
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:57,334
(motorcycle engine revs)

256
00:16:57,334 --> 00:16:58,334
Hmm.

257
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,420
Britt,

258
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,209
Jeremy Britt, I'm a CDM, a can-do man,

259
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,859
and I'd like to talk to you for a minute.

260
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,593
- Do me a favor, Mr. CDM.

261
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,266
Turn around and leave.

262
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:26,035
(Jeremy laughs)

263
00:17:26,036 --> 00:17:27,549
- That's pretty cold, man.

264
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,959
I give you a ride here, you
shut the door in my face,

265
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,349
and I ain't even said nothing
about your confederate hat.

266
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,793
Can't we just all get along?

267
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:39,063
Besides, I need some
muscle every now and then.

268
00:17:40,135 --> 00:17:41,509
- You want muscle, join a gym.

269
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,239
What is this, visitor's day?

270
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,429
- Senor McQue, Hector Chavez.

271
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,849
This is my brother, Jose.

272
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,537
- What can I do for you?

273
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,339
- Uh, we saw what you
could do at the restaurant

274
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,113
and we need to speak with you.

275
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,410
- Just one minute, please, senor.

276
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,403
- Go ahead.

277
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:03,359
- We come from a small
town called Los Robles.

278
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,869
It's in Texas on the Mexican border.

279
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:09,449
About 20 miles east,
there's this compound.

280
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,499
- It's for the Sons of Texas.

281
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,363
Senor, it's a bunch of
right-wing red necks.

282
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,750
- You've got 45 seconds.

283
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,773
- They hate us because we're Mexican.

284
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,569
They hate anybody who's not white.

285
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,809
They steal from us every month.

286
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,213
They take food, supplies,
anything they want.

287
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,899
They have killed and they have raped.

288
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,319
- The sheriff, he does nothing to help us.

289
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,433
- Why don't you go to the
state police, Texas Rangers?

290
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,479
- Oh, we can't, some of us are illegals.

291
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,909
Some of us have lived there for 30 years.

292
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,399
- So why don't you just fight back?

293
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,769
- Fight, we cannot fight back, senor, no.

294
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,863
No, see, there's over 100
of them and they are devils.

295
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,669
One of us tried to stand
up to them last week

296
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,470
and they murdered him in the street.

297
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,409
- We're not trained fighters, like you,

298
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,733
you and others like you.

299
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:12,052
(slow orchestral music)

300
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,623
- We are willing to pay, senor.

301
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:23,273
$14,000.

302
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,773
7,000 now and the balance when
you have completed the job.

303
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,619
You are our only hope, senor.

304
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,489
We cannot go back to
Los Robles empty handed.

305
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,990
We cannot let our people down.

306
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,029
- I feel for your problem.

307
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,479
You're not gonna find a lot of men willing

308
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,343
to risk their lives for $14,000.

309
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,740
Sorry.

310
00:19:52,736 --> 00:19:53,736
I can't help you.

311
00:19:54,536 --> 00:19:58,335
(slow guitar music)

312
00:19:58,336 --> 00:19:59,753
- Damn, let's go.

313
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,639
We were led to believe
that you were someone

314
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,215
who would understand, but
we're not gonna beg, vamos.

315
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:07,412
- Hector. (speaking in foreign language)

316
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:08,246
- No, vamos.

317
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:09,486
(Jose speaking in foreign language)

318
00:20:09,487 --> 00:20:10,487
- [Jose] We cannot listen

319
00:20:10,488 --> 00:20:15,487
to the. (speaking in foreign language)

320
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:20,349
- What if I told you there was a lot

321
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,600
of money at the compound,

322
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,379
that the town people have heard

323
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,849
that the militia has millions of dollars.

324
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,579
- Oh, si, senor, they
keep it in a big safe.

325
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,599
It's how they pay the
sheriff off every month.

326
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,650
We all know about it.

327
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,612
(Jeremy knocks)

328
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,339
- You hear that?

329
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,373
That would be opportunity knocking.

330
00:20:43,472 --> 00:20:45,439
You get a couple of your boys together,

331
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,151
take care of our friends' problems,

332
00:20:47,152 --> 00:20:50,313
and we're rolling in the
dough, millions, even.

333
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,993
- You want to chase
rainbows, go chase rainbows.

334
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,479
You don't know diddly
squat about this militia.

335
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,299
Now get the hell out of here, all of yous.

336
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,729
- [Hector] Jose, we're leaving.

337
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,668
- Wait, wait, wait, Chavez, whoa, whoa.

338
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:07,363
Chill, chill, my Spanish brother.

339
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:10,789
Come here, we can do this.

340
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,109
Let cooler heads prevail.

341
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,268
This is what I got in mind.

342
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:16,769
(guns firing)

343
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:32,799
- Sir, I must tell you, the
men are getting restless.

344
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,909
They've been training over a year.

345
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,910
They have yet to see action.

346
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,253
- In peaceful conditions,

347
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,323
a warlike man would turn upon himself.

348
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,652
Nietzsche said that.

349
00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:52,693
That is not going to happen here.

350
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,429
Our battle will soon be upon us.

351
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,359
This country is coming apart at the seams.

352
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,679
You got foreigners everywhere you look.

353
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,919
Washington is scheming
to take away even more

354
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,920
of our liberties.

355
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,699
Hell, we're the best
chance this country's got.

356
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,533
- [Commander] Cease fire.

357
00:22:10,534 --> 00:22:11,854
- [Lamont] Callin, get over here!

358
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,250
- Yes, sir?

359
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,719
- You men know that using
the telephone is prohibited.

360
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,209
- [Men] Yes, sir.

361
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,539
- That call, sir, will cost
you one week in the brig.

362
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,540
- Let's go.

363
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,759
- Find out what you can on him.

364
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,199
I want to know everything there is.

365
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
- Yes, sir.

366
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,720
- The rest of you men continue.

367
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,623
- Sons of Texas.

368
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,923
Lamont Sperry, blah blah blah blah blah.

369
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,789
Hmm, McQue, I took my men outside

370
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,439
and had a chat with them,
checked this stuff out,

371
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,259
they're right, look, straight from the net

372
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,579
and CIA email, I download the bio

373
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,809
of the militia leader Lamont Sperry,

374
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,199
former Special Forces commander.

375
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,709
He's supposed to be sitting on millions

376
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,834
in profits from illegal arms deals.

377
00:23:02,835 --> 00:23:04,549
Now, my guess is, the
money's at the compound,

378
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,219
like Hector and Jose said.

379
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,659
- What makes you think that?

380
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,929
- Well, he sure didn't put it in the bank

381
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,549
where the government can get to it.

382
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,139
- So why aren't the feds after it?

383
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,729
- After Waco and Ruby Ridge,

384
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,449
they want to be real sure
before they make a move.

385
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,200
- How reliable is this information?

386
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,463
- [Jeremy] Straight from the
government news releases.

387
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,479
- That gives me a lot of confidence.

388
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,539
- No, no, look, either the
money is at the compound,

389
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,290
or we can track it down from there.

390
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,519
I think it's at the compound.

391
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,169
You get yourself some men together,

392
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,020
I'll get a plane and get us to Texas.

393
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:39,669
- And how would you manage that?

394
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,509
- I'm a businessman.

395
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,239
A CDM, remember?

396
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,890
- How often do Sperry and
his men come to Los Robles?

397
00:23:46,745 --> 00:23:48,095
- At the end of each month.

398
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,859
- That gives me three weeks.

399
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,969
- How you gonna get these men?

400
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,159
- That's my business.

401
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,799
- How do you know they're
gonna be any good?

402
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
- I'll know.

403
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,009
You just leave that little bag here.

404
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,453
The other we'll expect when
I arrive in Los Robles.

405
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:04,993
- And when will that be?

406
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,747
- 12 days from now.

407
00:24:09,624 --> 00:24:12,329
- But how do we know you
just won't take our money

408
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,330
and not show up?

409
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,939
- You're just gonna have to trust me.

410
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,969
- Well, I'll be back tomorrow.

411
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,083
- Don't bother, just leave
your cellular number.

412
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:26,342
(slow music)

413
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,450
- MC Que, what's going on?

414
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:42,919
- What the hell are you doing here?

415
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,713
- I followed you, who you waiting for?

416
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,449
Look, I gotta know what's going on

417
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,700
before I put up the
dough to fly us to Texas.

418
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,340
Better get your ass out the street.

419
00:25:05,134 --> 00:25:07,801
(tires screech)

420
00:25:11,973 --> 00:25:14,473
(Dash laughs)

421
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,696
- [McQue] Good to see you.
- Long time.

422
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,659
- [McQue] So how's everything
on the racing circuit?

423
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,939
- Ah, it sucked.

424
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,773
- [McQue] Yeah?

425
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:27,679
- About a year ago, I got an accident.

426
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,369
French doctor said I'd
never walk again. (laughs)

427
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,729
What do they know, huh?

428
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,193
- [McQue] They know about
great wine and beautiful women.

429
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,329
- That's one of the things I respect

430
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,169
about McQue, no pretense.

431
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,116
- Yeah, I like that, too.

432
00:25:42,117 --> 00:25:44,603
- I need a driver, interested?

433
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,783
- Government or private?

434
00:25:46,783 --> 00:25:47,783
- Private.

435
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,629
- How much?

436
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,919
- Not much up front,

437
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,937
but it could be a big
payoff on the back end.

438
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,458
- I'm in.

439
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,733
- Let's have some fun.

440
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:08,289
- Great, Simms is my name.

441
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,200
- [Jeremy] Britt, Jeremy Britt.

442
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,033
- Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

443
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:11,809
Let's go for a ride, huh, yeah.

444
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,810
- Where we going?

445
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,620
- For pancakes.

446
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:16,520
(slow electronic music)

447
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:18,929
- Hold, hold on, I already
ate, I ain't hungry.

448
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,999
- Coffee.

449
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,389
- I don't drink coffee.

450
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,737
- Skim milk.

451
00:26:22,738 --> 00:26:23,738
- Skim milk?

452
00:26:24,574 --> 00:26:27,980
(car engine revs)

453
00:26:27,981 --> 00:26:29,231
Hey, slow down!

454
00:26:30,454 --> 00:26:33,371
(tires screeching)

455
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,967
Whoa, whoa, what the
hell is going on here?

456
00:26:43,968 --> 00:26:45,635
McQue, Simms, Simms!

457
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:49,269
- Come on.

458
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:08,497
- That was great, man, look
at McQue, McQue, McQue.

459
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:15,832
- [Dash] Come on, better
look out, get out of my way.

460
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:16,910
- [Patron] You're crazy!

461
00:27:16,911 --> 00:27:18,110
(overlapping chattering)

462
00:27:18,111 --> 00:27:20,750
(motorcycle engine revs)

463
00:27:20,751 --> 00:27:22,634
(Jeremy cries out)

464
00:27:22,635 --> 00:27:24,633
- [Dash] Look out, relax.

465
00:27:24,634 --> 00:27:26,062
- [Jeremy] Don't tell me what-

466
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:27,150
- [Dash] Whoa!

467
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:28,318
- Whoa, Simms!

468
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:33,207
(tires screeching)

469
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:34,448
(car horn honks)

470
00:27:34,449 --> 00:27:37,807
(Jeremy groans)

471
00:27:37,808 --> 00:27:40,592
Simms, my car, my car,
my car, my car, my car!

472
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:43,510
(tires screeching)

473
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:47,210
I, I think you'll be fine.

474
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:48,044
(overlapping chattering)

475
00:27:48,045 --> 00:27:51,309
- This is your last chance,
it's your last chance

476
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,810
to place your bets, place your bets.

477
00:27:53,811 --> 00:27:56,919
The last chance here,
time is running out, boys.

478
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,499
Place your bets, get
them down, get them down.

479
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,289
Get them down, don't be shy.

480
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:04,189
Last chance, and that's it,
no more money, my friend.

481
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,309
No more money, we're gonna get it on.

482
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:11,799
In this corner, all the way
from St. Louis, Missouri,

483
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,710
we've got Mike, the Missouri Mule.

484
00:28:14,711 --> 00:28:18,489
(background noise drowns out speaker)

485
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,490
- Yeah.

486
00:28:20,444 --> 00:28:22,680
(crowd cheers)

487
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:25,931
(overlapping shouting)

488
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,922
- That's right, folks, and over here,

489
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:32,081
coming to us all the way from Germany,

490
00:28:32,082 --> 00:28:34,520
we got Mr. Kurt Mayer.

491
00:28:34,521 --> 00:28:37,104
(crowd cheers)

492
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:42,259
Listen up, listen up, listen up.

493
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,463
We got the same rules as always.

494
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,682
There's not any.

495
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,723
(crowd cheers)

496
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:53,880
It's the last man standing is the winner.

497
00:28:53,881 --> 00:28:56,479
(slow dramatic music)

498
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,299
Let's go, gentlemen.

499
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:03,300
- I'm pumped.
(overlapping shouting)

500
00:29:03,837 --> 00:29:05,254
- Let's go, boys.

501
00:29:09,365 --> 00:29:12,404
Let's get it on, let's get it on.

502
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:15,655
(overlapping shouting)

503
00:29:24,046 --> 00:29:26,629
(crowd cheers)

504
00:29:43,801 --> 00:29:46,301
(Kurt groans)

505
00:29:51,883 --> 00:29:54,466
(crowd cheers)

506
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,049
(overlapping shouting)

507
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,083
(crowd cheers)

508
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:27,183
(overlapping shouting)

509
00:30:38,794 --> 00:30:41,072
- Good job, good job.

510
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:43,468
Yeah.
(crowd cheers)

511
00:30:43,469 --> 00:30:46,869
$145, and you earned every bit of it.

512
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,220
- [McQue] He deserves more.

513
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:51,813
- [Kurt] McQue in this house.

514
00:30:52,804 --> 00:30:55,125
- Kurt, how's the (indistinct)?

515
00:30:55,126 --> 00:30:57,793
(both laughing)

516
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,426
- Hey, Pauly, who the hell is this guy?

517
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,180
- Will you leave us alone, please?

518
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:06,381
How the hell did you find me?

519
00:31:06,382 --> 00:31:07,732
- I made a few phone calls.

520
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,820
What are you doing in a place like this?

521
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,679
- Hell, it's not easy to find a shop

522
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,763
in our line of work.

523
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,859
- Why don't you start your own business?

524
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,979
- Like what?

525
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,993
- [McQue] Protection.

526
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,269
- Depends for whom.

527
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:29,423
- Hey, he's got a job, be here
next week and don't be late.

528
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,183
- Shut up, pinhead.

529
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:34,999
How much?

530
00:31:36,193 --> 00:31:39,029
- 2,000 up front, maybe more.

531
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,080
That buys a lot of knockwurst.

532
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,873
- You have just bought yourself
some serious protection.

533
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,319
- [McQue] Come on, let's get out of here.

534
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,009
- Hey, what about me?

535
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:56,059
We got a contract for three more fights.

536
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,163
- Call my lawyer.

537
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,372
- So McQue, you gotta put
me down with this, man.

538
00:32:02,373 --> 00:32:04,543
I'm not gonna take no for an answer.

539
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,069
- Let me ask you, what
can you do? Can you fight?

540
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,070
- [Jeremy] Uh.

541
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,313
- Can you handle a weapon?

542
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:14,899
(Jeremy stammers)

543
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,450
Have you ever been in a battle?

544
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,519
- No, I'm an acquisitions man.

545
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,849
I can get my hands on
anything, and I'm smart.

546
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,082
- Well, if you're so smart,
then why would you want

547
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:26,283
to take a chance on
getting yourself killed?

548
00:32:27,193 --> 00:32:30,339
- I mean, I can't explain
it, but these guys,

549
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,239
Hector and Jose, I care for them, man.

550
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,300
I want to help them.

551
00:32:35,394 --> 00:32:36,744
- You really feel that way?

552
00:32:37,594 --> 00:32:39,789
- I swear to God, scout's honor.

553
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,843
Did you know I was an international scout?

554
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:44,529
- You know what?

555
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,272
You're full of shit.

556
00:32:46,273 --> 00:32:48,308
(both laughing)

557
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:50,839
But you put a smile on my face.

558
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,819
You get us the plane, you can ride along.

559
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,370
After that, we'll see.

560
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,159
- So tell me something
about this guy we're going

561
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,443
to pick up, who is he, what does he do?

562
00:33:01,944 --> 00:33:03,318
- He's crazy.

563
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,152
(slow music)

564
00:33:04,152 --> 00:33:05,152
Turn left at the sign.

565
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:23,606
- Two, four, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

566
00:33:25,413 --> 00:33:27,796
(quiet overlapping chattering)

567
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:30,747
- [Jeremy] You gotta be kidding
me, your friend works here?

568
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:33,853
McQue, she's looking at me.

569
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,580
- [McQue] Don't fall in love.

570
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:38,077
We'll be out of here in 15 seconds.

571
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,603
- You're not my boyfriend.

572
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,472
- Next time, try flowers, let's go.

573
00:33:52,473 --> 00:33:53,473
- McQue!

574
00:33:55,274 --> 00:34:00,274
Hey, McQue!
(overlapping chattering)

575
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,132
Back up the car, McQue!

576
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:04,372
- [Woman Guard] Stop, get over here!

577
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:05,611
- Come back, come here!

578
00:34:05,612 --> 00:34:07,952
- [Woman Guard] Hoffman, get over here!

579
00:34:07,953 --> 00:34:10,049
- Stop him, stop him!

580
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,246
(Latrell cheers)

581
00:34:11,247 --> 00:34:12,912
Stop him.
- [Patient] Oh, let him go.

582
00:34:12,913 --> 00:34:14,410
- Hey, stop!

583
00:34:14,411 --> 00:34:16,052
(overlapping chattering)

584
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:17,706
- Man, that was beautiful.

585
00:34:17,707 --> 00:34:19,739
McQue, man, to the rescue.

586
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:23,633
Hey, hey, who's this, this
your chauffer? (laughs)

587
00:34:25,374 --> 00:34:28,319
That was beautiful, Q
man, I loved it, man.

588
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,509
I loved it. (cheers)

589
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,729
I gotta piss, I gotta piss.

590
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,042
- Not yet.

591
00:34:34,043 --> 00:34:36,069
- I am about to urinate in your car

592
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,070
if you don't pull this thing over.

593
00:34:37,071 --> 00:34:38,863
Would you pull the car over?

594
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,180
Come on, come on, come on.

595
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,093
- Thank you for not pissing in my ashtray.

596
00:34:49,561 --> 00:34:53,069
(Latrell cheers)

597
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,070
- Sweet juniper.

598
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:56,467
I heard you got out of government service.

599
00:34:56,468 --> 00:34:58,473
What you been up to?

600
00:34:58,474 --> 00:35:01,639
- Oh, a little of this, a little of that.

601
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,340
- [Latrell] Well, you don't
take a man like the Q man,

602
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,709
take him out of covert
operations in Panama,

603
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,910
Grenada, end up putting
him behind the desk.

604
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:15,050
- Oh, I didn't know that.

605
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,909
- Much better, (sighs) much better.

606
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,860
- You still got connections in El Paso?

607
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,649
- Oh, yeah, yeah, I can
get you more armament

608
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,629
than half the countries
in the United Nations.

609
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,099
I mean, if it's still there,
I hadn't been there in years.

610
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,063
I have been a little preocupado. (laughs)

611
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,139
- What can you get your hands on?

612
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,023
- Well, I can... hey,
goddammit, don't touch me!

613
00:35:44,627 --> 00:35:48,199
Got a lot of weapons and
explosives and ammunition and such,

614
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,959
I think they got some civilian
things, some nitroglycerin.

615
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,899
Should ought to be able
to pack a pop still.

616
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,900
Might be dated.

617
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,793
You, uh, you got a good driver?

618
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:01,608
- Simms.

619
00:36:03,648 --> 00:36:04,648
- Simms?

620
00:36:06,672 --> 00:36:09,989
Simms, 'cause that son of a
bitch tried to kill me once.

621
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,739
Now, is there anybody else,
McQue, I need to know about?

622
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,039
- Remi Sykes.

623
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,109
- Well, now, Remi Sykes, she
can kill me anytime she wants.

624
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,648
I wouldn't mind getting
myself a little bit of that.

625
00:36:19,649 --> 00:36:22,982
(slow orchestral music)

626
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:44,007
(phone rings)

627
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,813
- Yeah?

628
00:36:45,814 --> 00:36:47,499
- [McQue] We'll all be
meeting at eight o'clock.

629
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,019
- Let's make it 8:15.

630
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,304
- [McQue] No later, Remi.

631
00:36:50,305 --> 00:36:51,305
- Yeah.

632
00:37:26,442 --> 00:37:27,423
- You have the money?

633
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,082
- Yeah, that was great.

634
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:30,916
- Where's your friend?

635
00:37:32,202 --> 00:37:33,919
(gun fires)

636
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,170
(slow music continues)

637
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,953
- Thank you.

638
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:07,786
- [Attendant] Thank you, ma'am.

639
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:10,945
(sirens wailing)

640
00:38:10,946 --> 00:38:12,613
Have a good evening.

641
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,493
- [Jeremy] Britt, Jeremy Britt.

642
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,453
- Remi Sykes.

643
00:38:45,793 --> 00:38:48,129
- Hi.

644
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,699
You're late.

645
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,009
- I thought I had some time to kill.

646
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,076
- Remi, good to see you.
- For sure.

647
00:38:53,077 --> 00:38:54,077
- Hi, you too.

648
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,843
- Kurt Mayer, please, have a seat.

649
00:38:58,723 --> 00:38:59,863
- Deutsche, huh?

650
00:38:59,864 --> 00:39:00,950
(Kurt speaking in foreign language)

651
00:39:00,951 --> 00:39:04,469
(Remi speaking in foreign language)

652
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,363
- [Kurt] Vienna?

653
00:39:05,363 --> 00:39:06,196
(Remi speaking in foreign language)

654
00:39:06,196 --> 00:39:07,196
- Salzburg.

655
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,460
- Where's Hoffman?

656
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,719
- Doesn't need to be here.

657
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,573
- You got Latrell Hoffman?

658
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,299
Well, that's just perfect, he's wacko.

659
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,789
- He may be a nut, but he's at his best

660
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,590
when his back's up against the wall.

661
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,399
- How do you fit in?

662
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,200
- I arranged for us to get to Texas.

663
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,109
- He's a travel agent.

664
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:36,479
- I'm a can-do man, anything
you guys need, I can do.

665
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,549
Planning, acquisitions, you name it.

666
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,629
I'm the one who got you the info

667
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,580
on Lamont Sperry and the Sons of Texas.

668
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,739
- When do we leave?

669
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,289
- Tomorrow.

670
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,893
We meet at the airport at 08:00 hours.

671
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:55,029
Kurt, you and Remi will train
any locals who volunteer.

672
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,219
Simms, you'll drive Hoffman

673
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,089
to pick up the ordnance and explosives.

674
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:03,200
- Hoffman, oh, great, thank you,

675
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:05,889
then you're gonna get me
killed the first day. (laughs)

676
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,602
- Better you than us.

677
00:40:07,603 --> 00:40:09,349
(group laughs)

678
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,289
Britt, you'll work with Hector and Jose

679
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:13,489
to gather all the information
you can on the compound.

680
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,629
I want building plans, photographs,

681
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,119
anything you can get your hands on.

682
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,343
Now, I want to reiterate
what I said before.

683
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,720
This is gonna be like
stepping into a bear trap,

684
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,060
but if we're successful,

685
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,459
there could be enough money
to make it worth the risk.

686
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,989
- Well, now, that's what
we're all in it for,

687
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,459
the money, huh, cheers.

688
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,963
- Hey, I'm down for the cause.

689
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,313
- If anyone wants out,
now's the time to speak up.

690
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,297
- One more beer, please.

691
00:40:48,298 --> 00:40:50,049
(group laughs)

692
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,830
- Okay, hasta manana.

693
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,980
- Yeah.

694
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,080
- Crazy German.

695
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,652
- Remi, from what I hear,

696
00:41:01,653 --> 00:41:04,273
this Los Robles is a dumpy little place.

697
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,449
So if you're too caught up with city life,

698
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,369
you're not gonna be happy.

699
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,789
- I'll be fine, what about him?

700
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,040
You think he's up for it?

701
00:41:14,074 --> 00:41:15,999
- Oh, you don't have to
worry about me, baby doll.

702
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,100
I'm down for anything.

703
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,833
- Don't call me baby doll.

704
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:22,687
(slow music)

705
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,187
(Remi scoffs)

706
00:41:27,687 --> 00:41:29,871
- You got a way with women.

707
00:41:29,872 --> 00:41:33,572
(slow dramatic music)
(plane propellers whirring)

708
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:34,790
- [Air Traffic Controller]
Midnight black 122,

709
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:36,874
you're clear for takeoff.

710
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:40,994
(plane engine roars)

711
00:41:52,195 --> 00:41:54,538
(slow guitar music)

712
00:41:54,539 --> 00:41:58,789
(men speaking in foreign language)

713
00:42:19,198 --> 00:42:23,698
(couple speaking in foreign language)

714
00:42:33,373 --> 00:42:37,790
(group speaking in foreign language)

715
00:42:42,218 --> 00:42:45,376
(Jose speaking in foreign language)

716
00:42:45,377 --> 00:42:47,960
(upbeat music)

717
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,597
(group speaking in foreign language)

718
00:43:22,464 --> 00:43:27,464
(group cheers)
(group applauds)

719
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,867
- Hey, yeah, forget y'all.

720
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:51,102
(group cheers)

721
00:44:02,283 --> 00:44:03,691
- Hey, thank you!

722
00:44:03,692 --> 00:44:05,038
(group cheers)

723
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:07,157
(Latrell speaking in foreign language)

724
00:44:07,158 --> 00:44:12,158
Thank you, thank you!
(overlapping chattering)

725
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:15,152
(group cheers)

726
00:44:21,741 --> 00:44:24,908
(slow dramatic music)

727
00:44:59,879 --> 00:45:02,441
(Latrell speaking in foreign language)

728
00:45:02,442 --> 00:45:04,678
- Yes, senor, you speak English.

729
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:07,429
(Latrell laughs)

730
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,679
- You do that again without permission,

731
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,930
you'll pull back a stump.

732
00:45:21,529 --> 00:45:22,909
- Is that the truck you promised us?

733
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:24,859
- Yeah, it's the best I could do.

734
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,963
My friend's plugging a leak.

735
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,429
- Can you call the town meet
tonight, about eight o'clock?

736
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,609
- Yeah, eight o'clock is good.

737
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:35,610
- Thank you.

738
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,380
There's your truck.

739
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,589
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

740
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:42,216
You don't want me to drive this, do you?

741
00:45:42,217 --> 00:45:43,899
- You want Hoffman to drive?

742
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,009
- Well, come on, hotshot,
gonna take us forever

743
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,010
in this beauty.

744
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:49,576
- [Dash] Oh, terrific, just terrific.

745
00:45:49,577 --> 00:45:51,096
- No Sauerbraten here.

746
00:45:51,097 --> 00:45:52,375
(Kurt laughs)

747
00:45:52,376 --> 00:45:54,709
(slow dramatic music)

748
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,729
- We couldn't come up with
anything on his background.

749
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:01,533
He could be a plant, or
maybe he was a true believer.

750
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:08,333
- In a few minutes, it won't
make a damn bit of difference.

751
00:46:09,457 --> 00:46:10,571
Go get him.

752
00:46:10,572 --> 00:46:11,959
- [Sven] Bring him in.

753
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,960
- Move it.

754
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,570
- All right, everybody, listen up.

755
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:22,763
Griffin is here to teach you
the power of martial arts.

756
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:28,423
So pay attention to this
most important lesson.

757
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,300
- You're no patriot, all
you teach is militias

758
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,269
your philosophy of evil.

759
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:37,280
You got that?

760
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:42,429
- The great turning point in our lives is

761
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:45,010
when we gain the courage
to accept our evil

762
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,420
as what is best in us.

763
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,240
Fight!

764
00:46:52,755 --> 00:46:53,789
(overlapping chattering)

765
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:56,051
- Come on, get up and fight!

766
00:46:56,052 --> 00:47:01,052
- Come on, come on.
(overlapping shouting)

767
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:15,031
- Come on, get up, let's go!

768
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:20,032
Come on, get up!
(overlapping shouting)

769
00:47:36,873 --> 00:47:40,040
(slow dramatic music)

770
00:47:47,751 --> 00:47:50,835
- Come on, kick him, take him down!

771
00:47:50,836 --> 00:47:54,086
(overlapping shouting)

772
00:48:14,594 --> 00:48:16,489
(Lamont sighs)

773
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:19,329
- I want him dropped out
on the old creek road.

774
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:21,230
Let the son of a bitch rot in the sun.

775
00:48:24,872 --> 00:48:29,569
- And your prayers have been
listened to for a long time,

776
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,270
and God willing, those prayers
are now being answered.

777
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,232
I wish now to introduce
you to Senor McQue.

778
00:48:38,233 --> 00:48:40,816
(Jeremy claps)

779
00:48:44,138 --> 00:48:45,138
Senor?

780
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:59,013
- It's not easy to live with fear.

781
00:49:01,154 --> 00:49:02,273
You feel powerless,

782
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:05,290
desperate.

783
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,393
This is your land,

784
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:10,900
your town.

785
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,700
No one's gonna defend it like you.

786
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:16,992
We need your help.

787
00:49:16,993 --> 00:49:18,443
- We don't know how to fight.

788
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,640
- That's it.

789
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,933
That's all I need, that impulse.

790
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:37,433
- But we hired you to fight.

791
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:41,409
We paid you a lot of money,
half of it in Los Angeles.

792
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:44,509
- And we'll earn every
penny of that money,

793
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:47,323
but there's about 100 of
them and only six of us.

794
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,100
Two of my men will be arriving
tomorrow with armament.

795
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,120
We'll find out which of
you can handle weapons

796
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:58,563
and teach you, give me some volunteers.

797
00:49:59,652 --> 00:50:02,879
(slow music)

798
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,743
- Look, uh, he's right.

799
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,680
It's about action here, we can't
keep looking at each other.

800
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,333
So who's down to help themselves?

801
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,409
- Senor, eh, no offense,

802
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:25,813
but you don't exactly look
like a fighter yourself.

803
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:29,000
- I'm not talking about that.

804
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:36,192
I'm looking for a few volunteers.

805
00:50:36,193 --> 00:50:39,443
(slow music continues)

806
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,053
- [Remi] This is ridiculous.

807
00:50:57,457 --> 00:50:59,099
- Hmm?

808
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,420
- Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

809
00:51:07,114 --> 00:51:09,781
(Latrell spits)

810
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,883
This is not what I do best.

811
00:51:15,438 --> 00:51:20,438
(truck creaks)
(Latrell grunts)

812
00:51:23,434 --> 00:51:24,584
Do you have to do that?

813
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,499
- You know, when I was in
the Clearview State Home,

814
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,709
I used to brush my teeth
four, maybe five times a day,

815
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:32,899
probably 15 minutes each.

816
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,619
Of course, you know, it's
very, very, very important

817
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,869
to floss, so what I'd
do is on the weekdays,

818
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:38,579
I would start to floss on the right,

819
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,079
and I'd work my way to the left,

820
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,509
and then on the weekends, I
would floss left, work right.

821
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:44,911
What day is it, anyway?

822
00:51:44,912 --> 00:51:46,703
- It's the worst day of my life.

823
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,869
- Anyway, you want to know what the moral

824
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:51,029
of the story is, Simms?

825
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:52,619
I mean, every picture tells a story,

826
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,453
every story has a moral.

827
00:51:53,454 --> 00:51:54,629
Would you, Mr. Simms,

828
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:57,469
like to know what the
moral of the story is?

829
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:58,770
- Enlighten me, would you?

830
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,163
- No tartar. (laughs)

831
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:09,940
- So,

832
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,693
GSG 9, huh, I'm impressed.

833
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:16,940
Most elite anti-terrorist
group in the world.

834
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,183
What the hell are you doing here?

835
00:52:21,334 --> 00:52:25,073
- When you turn 32, you can
no longer work in the field.

836
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,363
So I quit on my 32nd birthday.

837
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,799
You spend a lot of time alone?

838
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,033
- Yeah, I usually find
company disappointing.

839
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,039
- Why is that?

840
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,549
- I had a strange childhood,

841
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:42,500
maybe that had something to do with it.

842
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,032
We moved around a lot when I was a kid,

843
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:48,879
and I couldn't exactly tell my friends

844
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,713
what my dad did for a living.

845
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,909
So when he died,

846
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:58,553
I followed in his
footsteps, female cleaner.

847
00:52:59,414 --> 00:53:01,831
(slow music)

848
00:53:07,214 --> 00:53:09,612
- [Dash] Make it snappy.

849
00:53:09,613 --> 00:53:12,530
(truck door slams)

850
00:53:17,733 --> 00:53:20,400
(chain rattles)

851
00:53:37,513 --> 00:53:40,513
(truck engine revs)

852
00:53:57,534 --> 00:54:00,451
(truck door slams)

853
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,470
- The white zone is for
loading and unloading only.

854
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:11,613
Yeah, I think this is the place.

855
00:54:11,614 --> 00:54:12,781
Come on, hoss.

856
00:54:18,911 --> 00:54:20,911
Let me get that for you.

857
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,233
Looks about right.

858
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:31,830
Find anything there, hoss?

859
00:54:35,374 --> 00:54:37,169
- I don't believe this.

860
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,649
There's nothing there.

861
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,593
- Yeah, there you go.

862
00:54:43,332 --> 00:54:44,679
(lighter clicks)

863
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,680
Child proof.

864
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:49,703
Loony proof. (laughs)

865
00:54:51,173 --> 00:54:52,459
- Are you crazy?

866
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,699
- I'm certified crazy by the best doctors

867
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,350
in the whole state of California.

868
00:54:57,911 --> 00:55:00,963
- Give me that, give it to
me, give it to me, give it.

869
00:55:02,592 --> 00:55:03,571
With this much explosives,

870
00:55:03,572 --> 00:55:05,259
you could have blown us sky high, man.

871
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,899
- Yeah, but at least we'd get out

872
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,450
with a blaze of glory (laughs)

873
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:14,993
I got us in here,

874
00:55:14,994 --> 00:55:19,379
why don't you just go ahead
and load us up? (laughs)

875
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,616
- You need a straight jacket.
(Latrell laughs)

876
00:55:23,617 --> 00:55:24,857
(slow music)

877
00:55:24,858 --> 00:55:25,858
- Hmm?

878
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,190
Thanks.

879
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,470
- Nice try, (indistinct)
but I'm gonna need more.

880
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,613
All I can tell from this stuff is

881
00:55:44,614 --> 00:55:47,879
that the walls surrounding
the compound are

882
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,130
about 20 feet high and
there's one main gate.

883
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:56,170
- Man, I've tapped FBI
files, CIA files. (sighs)

884
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,913
I think it's time for some Britt tricks.

885
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:01,803
- [Dash] Let's roll.

886
00:56:01,803 --> 00:56:02,803
- I'm going.

887
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,817
(Dash pants)

888
00:56:11,979 --> 00:56:14,146
Are we having any fun yet?

889
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,130
(ordnance rattles)

890
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:16,963
- Ow.

891
00:56:16,964 --> 00:56:18,109
(gun fires)

892
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,219
- [Remi] Why are you here?

893
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,523
- With the money, I could start over,

894
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:27,319
and one day, if I meet the right woman,

895
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,120
maybe settle down and have a family.

896
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,700
- Well, that's not a
future I'd ever considered.

897
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:39,929
- I'm not driving that,
there's no way, that's suicide.

898
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,459
- You were driving the nitro,

899
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,379
what the hell do you
think McQue hired you for?

900
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,980
You're a good driver, aren't
you, huh, are you good?

901
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:48,659
- Yeah, I'm good.

902
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,959
- Then we have absolutely
no problem then, do we?

903
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,609
- Except I don't drive things like that.

904
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:55,809
Look at the tires on that,

905
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:57,879
you couldn't float them in a river.

906
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,043
Forget it, I ain't driving the nitro.

907
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,249
- Listen, Simms, I know you and me,

908
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,689
we've had our few differences in the past,

909
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:10,109
but I'm the kind of man
who can let bygones go by.

910
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:10,943
You know why?

911
00:57:10,944 --> 00:57:14,563
Because I can be extremely objective.

912
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:16,523
- Yeah.

913
00:57:16,524 --> 00:57:18,149
- You understand?

914
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:20,540
- Yeah, got it.
(fly buzzes)

915
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:22,209
(Latrell spits)

916
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,043
- I hate flies.

917
00:57:23,044 --> 00:57:24,059
- Me too.

918
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:24,893
- Let's go.

919
00:57:24,893 --> 00:57:25,726
- Okay.

920
00:57:25,726 --> 00:57:26,726
- Easy.

921
00:57:39,652 --> 00:57:42,319
(crate squeaks)

922
00:57:49,206 --> 00:57:51,956
(Latrell laughs)

923
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:58,302
- [Jeremy] Got it, hot off the
press, plans to the compound.

924
00:57:58,303 --> 00:58:01,532
There's the east gate, the west gate.

925
00:58:01,533 --> 00:58:06,533
I got us the plans, now
you gotta get us in there.

926
00:58:18,653 --> 00:58:21,632
(truck screeches)

927
00:58:21,633 --> 00:58:23,933
- What the hell are we
stopping for this time?

928
00:58:25,833 --> 00:58:28,250
- There's a body on the road.

929
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,300
- Is he breathing?

930
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,692
- Hell, I don't know, kick him.

931
00:58:41,693 --> 00:58:42,799
(Callin moans)

932
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,489
- Yeah, he's alive.

933
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:45,840
Let's get him in the truck.

934
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,479
I'll help you out.

935
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,073
- [Dash] Thank you.

936
00:58:50,074 --> 00:58:51,355
- I'll get the tarp.

937
00:58:51,356 --> 00:58:54,179
- What? (groans)

938
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,849
Stupid basket case.

939
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:59,750
In fact, you're way beyond
baskets, you're in the pottery.

940
00:59:01,627 --> 00:59:03,367
- Here, let me get this for you.

941
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:06,960
You got it?

942
00:59:16,263 --> 00:59:21,263
I got him, I got it.

943
00:59:28,478 --> 00:59:31,478
(truck engine revs)

944
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:44,791
You know, uh,

945
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:49,168
if we happen to hit a
chuckhole the wrong way,

946
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,723
if we're blown into,
say, a million pieces,

947
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,199
do you think we'll still meet God,

948
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,112
or will we meet him one piece at a time?

949
00:59:59,113 --> 01:00:00,879
- Just shut up, man.

950
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,359
I am tired of hearing about the home,

951
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,899
I'm tired of hearing about
your brushing, your flossing.

952
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,159
Can't you just talk about
something intelligent?

953
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,906
Because if you can't, just shut up

954
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:13,343
and don't say nothing at
all, you understand me?

955
01:00:16,699 --> 01:00:17,532
(slow dramatic music)

956
01:00:17,533 --> 01:00:20,163
- [Sven] Sir, the townspeople
have hired some mercenaries.

957
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:24,823
- Now this time, we're gonna
have to call out the dogs.

958
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:27,979
Your men wanted action?

959
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:28,980
- Yes, sir.

960
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,990
- Then it's action they'll get.

961
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:34,120
Turn them loose.

962
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,120
- Yes, sir.

963
01:00:38,777 --> 01:00:39,710
- I ought to kick your ass

964
01:00:39,711 --> 01:00:41,659
for everything you put me
through, you know that?

965
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:43,319
- Well, if you want to kiss my ass,

966
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,251
Simms, I can accommodate that.

967
01:00:45,252 --> 01:00:46,370
(Dash sighs)

968
01:00:46,371 --> 01:00:47,220
- You know, you're more dangerous

969
01:00:47,221 --> 01:00:48,739
to us than if you worked for Sperry.

970
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,309
If I didn't have so
much respect for McQue,

971
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,379
I'd break your neck.

972
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,759
- You know, I learned back at the home

973
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:53,839
that it's not really healthy

974
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,349
to keep all this pent
up aggression inside.

975
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:58,853
I suggest that you learn
how to release it, hoss.

976
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,740
- That's the first intelligent
thing you said all day.

977
01:01:08,351 --> 01:01:10,929
(Latrell cries out)

978
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:11,933
- Stop the bullshit.

979
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,720
You can kill each other
when we finish here.

980
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,630
- Come on, let me show you
what I found in the truck.

981
01:01:24,631 --> 01:01:26,181
And you need a straight jacket.

982
01:01:27,993 --> 01:01:30,093
- It's gonna wind up in your back someday.

983
01:01:31,836 --> 01:01:34,253
(slow music)

984
01:01:37,812 --> 01:01:39,145
Take him inside.

985
01:01:45,687 --> 01:01:47,280
- Hey, this ain't over.

986
01:01:52,033 --> 01:01:54,116
- You've got two choices.

987
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:56,360
Help us with what you know,

988
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:59,820
or I'll federal express
you back to Sperry.

989
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:10,092
Think about it for a couple of hours.

990
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:11,883
Untie him and give him some food.

991
01:02:14,741 --> 01:02:15,670
(door slams)

992
01:02:15,671 --> 01:02:17,139
- [Jeremy] Who's the man, McQue?

993
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:20,119
- Good job, Mr. CDM, but
this is just the structure.

994
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,020
We need to know what it's like inside.

995
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,329
- Seems like our friend here has something

996
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:27,653
he wants to say to us.

997
01:02:33,697 --> 01:02:35,439
- I'd like to help.

998
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,469
- You can start by giving
us a reason to trust you.

999
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:41,109
- Well, for starters, Sperry's got a safe

1000
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:44,039
with a few million dollars
inside, how's that?

1001
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,226
- Now how would you know that?

1002
01:02:45,227 --> 01:02:47,238
- Because I saw it.

1003
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:50,779
- Well, if you know where it
is, why don't you tell us?

1004
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:53,049
- Well, if you let me in
on some of the action,

1005
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:54,829
I'll show you where it is.

1006
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:57,630
- Can you detail the interior
structure of the compound?

1007
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,270
- Yeah.

1008
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:03,330
- Okay.

1009
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:06,840
Get to work.

1010
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,280
- Hey.

1011
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,580
How do I know I can trust you?

1012
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:20,400
- You're just gonna
have to take that risk.

1013
01:03:21,295 --> 01:03:25,045
(motorcycle engines revving)

1014
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:41,495
- [Man In Blue Shirt] No, senor, no!

1015
01:03:44,898 --> 01:03:47,815
(people screaming)

1016
01:03:57,619 --> 01:04:00,786
(slow dramatic music)

1017
01:04:26,456 --> 01:04:28,379
(man laughs)

1018
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:31,395
- Just what the hell do you
think you're doing here?

1019
01:04:31,396 --> 01:04:33,079
- We thought we'd do a little shopping.

1020
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,624
- A little what?

1021
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:36,150
- [Man On Red Motorcycle]
All right, scumbag.

1022
01:04:36,151 --> 01:04:36,984
(gun fires)

1023
01:04:36,985 --> 01:04:39,209
(man on red motorcycle cries out)

1024
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,693
- Just was the hell are you?

1025
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:43,186
You guys don't belong here,

1026
01:04:43,187 --> 01:04:45,263
and you are gonna learn a lesson.

1027
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:52,759
We'll be back, and when we do, (laughs)

1028
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,683
you're not gonna get off quite so easy.

1029
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,400
Okay, out of here.

1030
01:04:59,434 --> 01:05:03,184
(motorcycle engines revving)

1031
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:08,547
(slow music)

1032
01:05:08,548 --> 01:05:10,259
- [Lamont] It's a damned disgrace!

1033
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:11,979
- [Australian Man] She had a rifle, man,

1034
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,499
she was up in the tower.

1035
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,667
Look, there was nothing we could do.

1036
01:05:15,668 --> 01:05:18,909
I'm telling you, there
was nothing we could do.

1037
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:20,610
Now, she could have killed us all.

1038
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,799
- What am I seeing here?

1039
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,563
- This low-life (indistinct)
is a disgrace to all of us.

1040
01:05:29,112 --> 01:05:32,369
- And what do we do when
someone disgraces us?

1041
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:33,370
- Punish him.

1042
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,553
- Then punish him.

1043
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:44,913
Get out of my sight.

1044
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:53,548
- [Announcer] Attention, Lieutenant Smith,

1045
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:56,388
ordnance assembly, please.

1046
01:05:56,389 --> 01:06:00,056
Lieutenant Smith,
ordnance assembly, please.

1047
01:06:01,863 --> 01:06:03,183
- I'll kill them all.

1048
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:09,433
Guess I have to take care
of everything myself.

1049
01:06:11,069 --> 01:06:14,402
(slow orchestral music)

1050
01:06:23,042 --> 01:06:24,069
- [McQue] Well, I didn't plan that out.

1051
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:27,717
- You just happened to get
it like that, huh? (laughs)

1052
01:06:35,003 --> 01:06:36,429
- [Lamont] Now, don't you be dealing

1053
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:38,130
from the bottom of the deck to me.

1054
01:06:47,732 --> 01:06:51,089
- Why don't you guys get something to eat?

1055
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,240
- [Dash] I'll be close.

1056
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:57,073
- [Jeremy] Uh, hold up, I'll go with you.

1057
01:06:58,466 --> 01:07:01,549
(slow ominous music)

1058
01:07:24,677 --> 01:07:26,889
- Do you like blackjack?

1059
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:29,340
- I like anything where
the odds are in my favor.

1060
01:07:37,854 --> 01:07:39,409
What are the stakes?

1061
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:40,869
- Too high for either of us.

1062
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:43,713
- Oh, I don't know, my
pocket's pretty deep.

1063
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:46,490
- Mine aren't.

1064
01:07:49,403 --> 01:07:50,403
- Hit me.

1065
01:07:54,078 --> 01:07:57,099
Why don't you just quit
while you're ahead?

1066
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,223
- I feel lucky today.

1067
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,593
- Why don't we just cut to the chase?

1068
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,033
You don't belong here,

1069
01:08:12,243 --> 01:08:13,939
so why don't you take your little group

1070
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:15,949
and you get out of town?

1071
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:18,199
Because if you are still
here tomorrow afternoon,

1072
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,630
this little town

1073
01:08:22,062 --> 01:08:23,253
will cease to exist.

1074
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:27,469
- Well, I was thinking of
sticking around 'til the election.

1075
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,149
- [Lamont] What election?

1076
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:30,150
- Haven't you heard?

1077
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,641
I'm running for mayor.

1078
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:35,309
(Lamont laughs)

1079
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:39,670
- Let me ask you something.

1080
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:44,890
Why the hell do you want to die
for a bunch of taco vendors?

1081
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,723
- I got real bored with my day job.

1082
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:58,210
- [Lamont] Don't forget,
tomorrow afternoon.

1083
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:10,253
- Sperry means what he says.

1084
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:13,470
He could wipe this town out in a heartbeat

1085
01:09:14,502 --> 01:09:16,183
and never get his hands dirty.

1086
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:21,230
- I know.

1087
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,400
Something's been bothering me.

1088
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,880
- What's that?

1089
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:34,893
- Why would a nice guy like
Sperry want to kill you?

1090
01:09:36,902 --> 01:09:39,319
(slow music)

1091
01:09:41,702 --> 01:09:43,952
- I was working undercover,

1092
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:46,530
FBI.

1093
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:50,530
I was trying to build
a case against Sperry.

1094
01:09:52,222 --> 01:09:55,472
(slow music continues)

1095
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:04,253
- We move on the compound at 23:00.

1096
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:06,779
If anything goes wrong,
Sperry's gonna come

1097
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:07,780
and level the town.

1098
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,799
Britt?

1099
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,660
- Yeah?

1100
01:10:11,661 --> 01:10:14,142
- Be ready to evacuate the people.

1101
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:16,069
- Where do you want me to take them?

1102
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:17,370
- As far away as possible.

1103
01:10:18,513 --> 01:10:20,649
- Hold on, if I'm evacuating,

1104
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:22,150
I'm gonna miss all the action.

1105
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:25,949
- You're not trained for the action.

1106
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:27,679
Callin, you and I will take out the guard

1107
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:30,659
at the front gate and
go around the west side.

1108
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:34,261
Remi, you and Simms
infiltrate the arsenal.

1109
01:10:34,262 --> 01:10:36,913
Kurt, place the explosives
along the inside.

1110
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,177
- I'm still pissed I'm
not going with you, McQue.

1111
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:50,153
- I just don't want you to get killed.

1112
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:54,749
We ready?

1113
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,583
- [Remi] Yeah.

1114
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:56,468
- [Latrell] Ready here.

1115
01:10:56,468 --> 01:10:57,301
- [Kurt] Ready here, boss.

1116
01:10:57,302 --> 01:10:58,689
- Let's move.

1117
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:03,690
(truck engine revs)
(slow dramatic music)

1118
01:11:18,492 --> 01:11:22,992
(Hector speaking in foreign language)

1119
01:11:43,635 --> 01:11:46,885
(truck doors slamming)

1120
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,479
You all know what to do.

1121
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,313
If we do it right,

1122
01:11:51,314 --> 01:11:53,649
we'll get in and out
without waking anyone up.

1123
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:55,489
- Yeah, well, they're in
for a little rude awakening

1124
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:58,723
after we're gone, aren't
they, boss? (laughs)

1125
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,043
- We'll have 15 minutes
after the charge is set.

1126
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:07,553
That means we're out of
here in 01:00, let's do it.

1127
01:12:15,318 --> 01:12:17,735
(slow music)

1128
01:12:32,637 --> 01:12:34,709
- [Sam] Callin, what the
hell are you doing here?

1129
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:35,710
- [Callin] Hey, Sam.

1130
01:13:24,263 --> 01:13:27,302
- I think I'm more afraid
of you than I am of them.

1131
01:13:27,303 --> 01:13:29,386
- [Callin] You should be.

1132
01:13:52,135 --> 01:13:54,869
- You sure you got him?

1133
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:56,870
- Does the pope wear gold bowling shoes?

1134
01:13:59,136 --> 01:14:01,469
(gun fires)

1135
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:04,950
Got him.

1136
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:21,750
- [Dash] I lost him.

1137
01:15:06,003 --> 01:15:06,920
I'll meet you at the south gate.

1138
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:07,920
- [Kurt] Yeah, yeah.

1139
01:15:10,014 --> 01:15:13,092
(crickets chirping)

1140
01:15:13,093 --> 01:15:15,426
(gun cocks)

1141
01:15:17,335 --> 01:15:18,418
- Hey, Britt.

1142
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:21,652
- What?

1143
01:15:21,653 --> 01:15:24,103
- You know how old I was
when I first held a gun?

1144
01:15:25,913 --> 01:15:26,913
- No.

1145
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:31,623
- About four and a half
hours younger than I am now.

1146
01:15:58,094 --> 01:16:01,261
(slow dramatic music)

1147
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:23,799
- Hector.

1148
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,800
- Yeah?

1149
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:31,183
- I can't stand it, I know they
need every man they can get,

1150
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:34,070
and I'm sitting here babysitting.

1151
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,723
I gotta go, man, give me the keys.

1152
01:16:39,837 --> 01:16:42,077
- No, you can't drive my truck,
I have to drive my truck.

1153
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:44,430
- Let's go.

1154
01:16:45,887 --> 01:16:48,366
- Hector, what are you doing, man?

1155
01:16:48,367 --> 01:16:49,200
(truck door slams)

1156
01:16:49,201 --> 01:16:50,264
Wait for me!

1157
01:16:50,265 --> 01:16:53,265
(truck engine revs)

1158
01:17:03,061 --> 01:17:05,767
Do you think maybe this is a mistake?

1159
01:17:05,768 --> 01:17:08,185
(slow music)

1160
01:17:25,023 --> 01:17:26,000
- [Man In Bandana] Hey, bitch.

1161
01:17:26,001 --> 01:17:28,500
(Remi grunts)

1162
01:17:37,495 --> 01:17:39,286
(man in bandana cries out)

1163
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:41,486
- [Remi] Hoffman, where are you?

1164
01:17:41,487 --> 01:17:43,904
(slow music)

1165
01:17:57,786 --> 01:18:00,619
(machinery beeps)

1166
01:18:08,866 --> 01:18:09,866
- Come on.

1167
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:18,105
- Come on, this way.

1168
01:18:18,106 --> 01:18:18,939
- [Jose] Where's he going?

1169
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:21,106
- [Hector] I have no idea.

1170
01:18:26,053 --> 01:18:28,083
- You're not from around here, are you?

1171
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:33,979
- Well, actually, I'm, uh, I'm
just passing through, hoss.

1172
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:34,980
- Wise guy, huh?

1173
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:38,490
Let's go have a chat with the commander.

1174
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,223
Don't even try, hoss.

1175
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:50,557
(gun fires)

1176
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:54,510
- [McQue] Come on.

1177
01:18:57,801 --> 01:19:02,801
(alarm wails)
(quiet overlapping chattering)

1178
01:19:05,599 --> 01:19:07,932
(gun fires)

1179
01:19:09,559 --> 01:19:10,559
- Goddamn.

1180
01:19:11,677 --> 01:19:16,677
(overlapping chattering)
(alarm wails)

1181
01:19:20,978 --> 01:19:24,979
- Sir, we have intruders
inside the compound.

1182
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:27,893
- Shoot them on sight,
I'm gonna cut him up.

1183
01:19:30,418 --> 01:19:32,860
(overlapping shouting)
(alarm wails)

1184
01:19:32,861 --> 01:19:37,861
(explosives beeping)
(overlapping shouting)

1185
01:19:46,008 --> 01:19:47,447
- [Militiaman] Let's go, come on!

1186
01:19:47,448 --> 01:19:50,844
Move it, move it, move it, let's move it!

1187
01:19:50,845 --> 01:19:52,796
(overlapping shouting)

1188
01:19:52,797 --> 01:19:56,299
(truck tires screeching)
(slow music)

1189
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:59,029
- [Dash] Hey, man, what
happened, what's going on?

1190
01:19:59,030 --> 01:20:00,833
- Well, we had a little mishap.

1191
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:02,503
Simms, down!

1192
01:20:02,504 --> 01:20:04,836
(gun fires)

1193
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:14,289
Simms, you all right?

1194
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:18,149
- Yeah, you know, straight
jacket, you're all right.

1195
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:19,150
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1196
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:21,173
- No, you goof, I'm trying

1197
01:20:21,174 --> 01:20:23,409
to tell you you're okay in my book.

1198
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:25,239
- Yeah, well, I love you, too, honey,

1199
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:26,513
but we'll have to bond later.

1200
01:20:26,514 --> 01:20:27,347
(gun clicks)

1201
01:20:27,347 --> 01:20:28,347
Come on, let's go.

1202
01:20:29,543 --> 01:20:30,804
- Jesus.

1203
01:20:30,805 --> 01:20:31,923
(overlapping shouting)
(slow dramatic music)

1204
01:20:31,924 --> 01:20:32,757
- [Militiaman] Freeze!

1205
01:20:32,758 --> 01:20:35,090
(gun fires)

1206
01:20:42,603 --> 01:20:44,522
- [Militiaman] Cover me, cover me!

1207
01:20:44,523 --> 01:20:46,902
(overlapping shouting)

1208
01:20:46,903 --> 01:20:49,236
(gun fires)

1209
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:55,020
(guns firing)

1210
01:20:55,021 --> 01:20:58,438
(motorcycle engine revs)

1211
01:21:01,714 --> 01:21:04,961
(explosion rumbles)

1212
01:21:04,962 --> 01:21:07,462
(guns firing)

1213
01:21:13,993 --> 01:21:17,009
- Get some men to shut off the front gate.

1214
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:18,210
What's on your forehead?

1215
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:20,670
- What are you boys doing?

1216
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:23,298
- Drop the gun.

1217
01:21:23,299 --> 01:21:26,099
- Well, it looks like we've
got a Mexican standoff here.

1218
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:32,597
- So you think I'm scared
of you, huh, bitch?

1219
01:21:32,598 --> 01:21:34,509
(gun fires)

1220
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:37,018
- Hell, yes, I think you're afraid of me.

1221
01:21:37,019 --> 01:21:39,514
(explosives beeping)

1222
01:21:39,515 --> 01:21:44,432
(guns firing)
(slow music)

1223
01:21:53,401 --> 01:21:56,116
- [Militiaman] Let's go up,
come on, let's go up, now, now!

1224
01:21:56,117 --> 01:22:01,117
(door creaks)
(overlapping shouting)

1225
01:22:02,812 --> 01:22:05,011
We gotta get out of here, we
gotta get out of here, now!

1226
01:22:05,012 --> 01:22:06,229
(gun clicks)

1227
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:08,203
- You should have quit
while you were ahead.

1228
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:16,519
Now I'm the house, I'm dealing the cards,

1229
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,368
and this game is over.

1230
01:22:18,369 --> 01:22:21,286
(Lamont cries out)

1231
01:22:31,944 --> 01:22:34,333
I'm gonna gut you like a fish.

1232
01:22:34,334 --> 01:22:37,858
(gun fires)
(Lamont cries out)

1233
01:22:37,859 --> 01:22:39,809
- That's for the First Amendment.

1234
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:42,477
(Lamont groans)

1235
01:22:43,704 --> 01:22:44,537
(gun fires)

1236
01:22:44,538 --> 01:22:47,454
(Lamont cries out)

1237
01:22:48,462 --> 01:22:50,817
That's so you never walk on anyone again.

1238
01:22:52,037 --> 01:22:54,620
(Lamont moans)

1239
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,129
You've got about two minutes
before you're pixie dust.

1240
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:02,677
How fast can you crawl?

1241
01:23:04,969 --> 01:23:09,969
(slow music)
(guns firing)

1242
01:23:19,486 --> 01:23:24,486
(motorcycle engine revs)
(guns firing)

1243
01:23:26,851 --> 01:23:29,716
(explosion rumbles)

1244
01:23:29,717 --> 01:23:33,758
- Go, go, go, cover, come
on, let's move in, come on!

1245
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:38,759
(guns firing)
(overlapping shouting)

1246
01:23:39,978 --> 01:23:41,892
Move it, come on, move it!

1247
01:23:41,893 --> 01:23:44,393
- [Militiaman] Shannon, hold on, hold on!

1248
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:47,331
(guns firing)

1249
01:23:47,332 --> 01:23:48,971
(Remi cries out)

1250
01:23:48,972 --> 01:23:50,639
- Kurt, Remi's down!

1251
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:54,080
- [Kurt] Remi.

1252
01:23:54,081 --> 01:23:58,515
- Move, move, straight
jacket, where are you?

1253
01:23:58,516 --> 01:24:02,108
Go, go, come on, Kurt!
(guns firing)

1254
01:24:02,109 --> 01:24:06,113
Straight jacket, where
are you, straight jacket!

1255
01:24:06,114 --> 01:24:09,197
(explosives beeping)

1256
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:12,690
(guns firing)

1257
01:24:12,691 --> 01:24:13,691
Come on!

1258
01:24:16,612 --> 01:24:18,178
Go!

1259
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:19,290
- [Hector] Jose!

1260
01:24:19,291 --> 01:24:20,124
(guns firing)

1261
01:24:20,125 --> 01:24:21,291
- Go, come on!

1262
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:29,453
- [Militiaman] I'm out of ammo.

1263
01:24:30,389 --> 01:24:33,056
(Lamont groans)

1264
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:35,527
- One more thing.

1265
01:24:38,112 --> 01:24:40,671
This is because you're
a lousy card player.

1266
01:24:40,672 --> 01:24:43,005
(gun fires)

1267
01:24:44,392 --> 01:24:47,471
(explosives beeping)

1268
01:24:47,472 --> 01:24:51,416
(slow music)
(guns firing)

1269
01:24:51,417 --> 01:24:52,476
- He's dead!

1270
01:24:52,477 --> 01:24:54,296
- He's my brother, we can't leave!

1271
01:24:54,297 --> 01:24:57,056
(overlapping shouting)

1272
01:24:57,057 --> 01:24:58,241
(truck engine revs)

1273
01:24:58,242 --> 01:24:59,742
Oh, God, no, Jose!

1274
01:25:01,574 --> 01:25:03,936
Jose!
(guns firing)

1275
01:25:03,937 --> 01:25:08,680
(Hector speaking in foreign language)

1276
01:25:08,681 --> 01:25:11,431
(glass shatters)

1277
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:15,677
(overlapping shouting)
(gun fires)

1278
01:25:15,678 --> 01:25:16,511
- Go, go!

1279
01:25:16,512 --> 01:25:18,595
- [Latrell] You get your ass up here!

1280
01:25:18,596 --> 01:25:20,425
- [McQue] Where Callin?

1281
01:25:20,426 --> 01:25:23,614
(explosives beeping)

1282
01:25:23,615 --> 01:25:26,615
(explosion rumbles)

1283
01:25:35,035 --> 01:25:36,929
(slow music)

1284
01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:38,218
- [Jeremy] So when you get back-

1285
01:25:38,219 --> 01:25:39,174
- [McQue] Sorry about the money.

1286
01:25:39,175 --> 01:25:41,743
- [Jeremy] You need to call me up.

1287
01:25:41,744 --> 01:25:42,577
- Yeah, yeah.

1288
01:25:42,578 --> 01:25:44,227
- Well, I'll be, go to hell, huh?

1289
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:49,433
- Yo, boss.
(overlapping chattering)

1290
01:26:02,428 --> 01:26:05,679
- It's good to know I'm still
a good judge of character.

1291
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:07,730
- The government's still gonna want this.

1292
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:12,593
Unless, of course, it's just a
figment of their imagination.

1293
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:16,053
Mind if I get a lift?

1294
01:26:16,054 --> 01:26:18,637
(upbeat music)

1295
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:23,060
- I told you.

1296
01:26:26,328 --> 01:26:27,328
- McQue?

1297
01:26:30,668 --> 01:26:34,501
I just want to thank you
all for what you did.

1298
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:36,850
Here's the money I promised.

1299
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:04,790
- Rebuild your town, take
care of your brother's family.

1300
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:09,780
- I will, I promise.

1301
01:27:14,528 --> 01:27:15,875
(upbeat music)

1302
01:27:15,876 --> 01:27:17,946
- Will you help me get
some of these cases?

1303
01:27:17,947 --> 01:27:19,415
- Let's get on this bus, huh?

1304
01:27:19,416 --> 01:27:21,184
(overlapping chattering)

1305
01:27:21,185 --> 01:27:23,935
(Latrell laughs)

1306
01:27:25,334 --> 01:27:27,737
(overlapping chattering)

1307
01:27:27,738 --> 01:27:28,571
- [Dash] Kurt.

1308
01:27:28,571 --> 01:27:29,404
- Thank you very much.

1309
01:27:29,405 --> 01:27:30,510
- Cheers.

1310
01:27:30,511 --> 01:27:33,610
- You want me to fly this thing? (laughs)

1311
01:27:33,611 --> 01:27:35,232
(overlapping chattering)

1312
01:27:35,233 --> 01:27:37,470
Come on, everybody, let's go home.

1313
01:27:37,471 --> 01:27:40,671
Don't worry, I can fly
this thing. (laughs)

1314
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:44,089
(overlapping chattering)

1315
01:27:48,472 --> 01:27:51,389
(slow rock music)
