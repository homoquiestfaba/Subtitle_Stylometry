1
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,969
{\\an8}Good morning, Vincenzo.
-Hello, Julie.

2
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,919
ARTIST ENTRANCE

3
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:33,998
You never buy anything from me.
-You're too expensive.

4
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:36,437
Too expensive?
-Yes.

5
00:04:42,597 --> 00:04:44,637
Good morning darling.

6
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:48,111
Slept well? Here's your cappuccino.

7
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:49,358
What a night.

8
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:53,876
I haven't slept a wink.
The neighbors were making such a noise.

9
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:57,859
Jérôme heard nothing,
but i am a light sleeper.

10
00:04:57,985 --> 00:05:03,155
The artichokes for your father.
That's an obsession for him.

11
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:08,075
I have bought you 
a beautiful nail polish  You’ll love that one.

12
00:05:09,115 --> 00:05:10,874
Aren't you laughing?

13
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:12,594
Maybe later.

14
00:05:15,434 --> 00:05:17,074
Good morning, professor.

15
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:47,991
Tolerance...

16
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:54,070
Good morning, Vincenzo.
-Hello, Gerard.

17
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,270
Everything okay?
-Fine and you?

18
00:05:56,431 --> 00:05:58,750
Have you boxed yet?
-No.

19
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,910
I prefer to knock them out
at the end of the day.

20
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,750
That's tradition.
-Yes?

21
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:09,309
Her husband said
that she should go to therapy...

22
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:13,029
...because she was obsessed
by her father, a womanizer.

23
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:17,268
She did
and she got rid of that obsession.

24
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:21,628
But she was still unhappy,
so she went back to therapy.

25
00:06:21,787 --> 00:06:25,708
This time it was about her son,
who was on drugs.

26
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:27,388
But she remained unhappy.

27
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:31,307
So she came to me
and I said to her:

28
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:33,667
Virginia, your husband is right.

29
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:38,866
Go to therapy for you
to free from the last bastard:

30
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,626
Your husband.

31
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:47,546
She's madly in love with me
like all my patients.

32
00:06:47,705 --> 00:06:49,066
Except for you.

33
00:06:50,506 --> 00:06:54,146
Do you know why, Albertine?
Because you have no taste.

34
00:06:57,305 --> 00:06:59,184
Still no period?

35
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:03,584
You're not pregnant, are you?

36
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:13,463
Albertine, right.

37
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:17,063
If you ever decide
to get off your pedestal...

38
00:07:18,383 --> 00:07:20,303
then come to us.

39
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:27,383
In this sea of misery where we
blissfully immerse us in it.

40
00:07:30,223 --> 00:07:32,022
The roof tile is still there.

41
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:35,461
That has been the case for months now.

42
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:38,821
I don't think it's falling yet.

43
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:43,621
The one fragile balance
keeps it longer than the other.

44
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,220
I know you can talk.

45
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,619
Little golden frog.

46
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:42,215
Boubou...

47
00:08:43,495 --> 00:08:44,695
Boubou...

48
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:50,294
Boubou...

49
00:08:51,894 --> 00:08:54,214
I lost my dog Boubou.

50
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,975
His snout stuck out of my bag,
and suddenly he was gone.

51
00:08:58,133 --> 00:08:59,894
My umbrella and my dog.

52
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:04,693
I had to flee
a horrible man in the subway.

53
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:10,052
Then he sat by himself,
disgusting.

54
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:14,812
And this morning
my moped won't start.

55
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:19,891
Whether it's the gasoline, bad luck
or the spark plugs... Boubou...

56
00:09:22,412 --> 00:09:26,892
I'm late for rehearsal and
the director can't stand dogs.

57
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,730
Who is bothered by
of such a beast?

58
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:33,570
I have to go.

59
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,210
Off.

60
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,330
Boubou...

61
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:05,168
Hey Vincenzo.

62
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:07,367
I was at the pharmacy today.

63
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:13,247
A beautiful girl entered,
with those beautiful curves.

64
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:17,926
She wanted to weigh herself.
She put a coin in the scale.

65
00:10:18,086 --> 00:10:20,926
But she wasn't happy
with the result.

66
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:24,006
She steps off the scale,
takes off her coat...

67
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:29,126
...insert another coin and that's it
still not happy with the result.

68
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:33,686
Then she takes off her sweater,
but she has no more coins.

69
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:37,285
So I said: When you take off your dress...

70
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:39,325
...I'll toss in a coin.

71
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:43,244
Have a little laugh, Vincenzo.

72
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:18,161
Shall we be go for a walk 
in the park tomorrow?

73
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:20,281
No one sees us.

74
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:23,720
See if there are squirrels.

75
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,160
Goodnight, Albertine.

76
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:35,840
You are my star.

77
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:16,155
SORRY, I HAVE NO WORDS FOR IT

78
00:12:47,072 --> 00:12:50,273
and yet, when I look to the sky

79
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:52,273
I feel that everything will get better

80
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:55,432
and that this cruelty too will end

81
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:06,951
Good day.
-Good day.

82
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:12,671
Are you looking for something special?
-I'm looking for Boubou.

83
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,070
I've looked under every car.

84
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,629
I was on my knees all night.

85
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,669
Then you're not alone.
Goodbye, Vincenzo.

86
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:29,230
I feel so guilty.
I've had that all my life.

87
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,869
I had that before I could talk.
-You're not alone.

88
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:37,948
Without guilt
there would be no writers.

89
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:41,989
What is your name?
-Vincenzo.

90
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:46,428
Italian, bookseller...

91
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:52,507
Wait a minute...
Can you tell me something quickly?

92
00:13:52,668 --> 00:13:55,746
Not on top of the books.

93
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,386
A thing.
-What are you doing?

94
00:14:00,546 --> 00:14:02,746
Tell me something.

95
00:14:03,905 --> 00:14:06,745
Something that happens to you.

96
00:14:08,785 --> 00:14:09,745
Forward.

97
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:15,305
Cut the onions and fry them
in a little oil.

98
00:14:16,265 --> 00:14:20,064
Turn off the fire
and add the chopped parsley.

99
00:14:20,184 --> 00:14:22,544
Cut the sardines into small pieces.

100
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:26,344
Put some flour on the fish...

101
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:33,663
What is that?
-The cod stockfish recipe...

102
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:36,543
...like they make it in Vicenza.

103
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:38,703
You are a weirdo.

104
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:42,862
You just need to prove it.

105
00:14:43,022 --> 00:14:47,942
That reminds me of a character
that says: I'm a weirdo.

106
00:14:48,062 --> 00:14:52,422
Hemingway replied:
You just need to prove it.

107
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:55,941
That is enough.

108
00:14:56,102 --> 00:15:00,620
You are surrounded by books.
-Yes.

109
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:06,700
But...
What are those books for?

110
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:13,100
We live in the digital age.
Paper is old-fashioned.

111
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,540
That's all superfluous.
Totally unnecessary.

112
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:18,580
What?
-Honestly...

113
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,659
Don't you feel a little
a <i>dead man walking</i> ?

114
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:32,058
The dialogue with all those books
keeps me alive.

115
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:38,417
Literature is eternal,
the present kills us.

116
00:15:39,377 --> 00:15:42,218
The present kills us.
-Yes.

117
00:15:43,897 --> 00:15:46,336
Brilliant. How cool.

118
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:50,856
Material for the other madman.
That is...

119
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:56,497
What does that mean:
'The present is killing us'?

120
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,975
It destroys us.

121
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:02,856
It doesn't make us stronger
but vulnerable.

122
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:07,975
Man actually needs it
to pause for a moment...

123
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,494
...and to be.

124
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:20,174
Damn, the battery is dead.

125
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:25,013
Do you happen to have a charger?
-No, I don't have a cell phone.

126
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:26,813
No cell phone?
-No.

127
00:16:26,933 --> 00:16:30,252
You don't have a mobile phone?
-Nope.

128
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:37,051
No cell phone.

129
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:40,532
Unbelieveable.

130
00:17:34,408 --> 00:17:36,047
Nice huh?

131
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:41,526
“No and no again,” Cosimo cried
and pushed his plate away.

132
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:43,046
Get off the table.

133
00:17:43,206 --> 00:17:47,086
Cosimo had already turned around
and left the room.

134
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:49,886
Where are you going?

135
00:17:50,045 --> 00:17:53,725
Cosimo climbed a tree
and sat down on a large branch...

136
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:56,404
...while his legs
dangling down...

137
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:58,285
...crossing his arms...

138
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:02,844
...retracted his head
and his hat over his forehead.

139
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:05,444
Father leaned out the window:

140
00:18:05,604 --> 00:18:11,163
When you've had enough
you’ll change your mind, he cried.

141
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:15,283
I'll never change my mind
my brother called from his branch.

142
00:18:15,403 --> 00:18:19,043
You will see it,
as soon as you come down.

143
00:18:19,163 --> 00:18:21,883
I'm never coming down again.

144
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:27,642
And he kept his word.'

145
00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:35,121
Isn't that wonderful?

146
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:43,721
Good night, honey.

147
00:19:14,197 --> 00:19:17,277
Good night.
-Good night.

148
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:24,798
Did you find your dog?
-No, not yet.

149
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,236
He was afraid,
I had to hide him...

150
00:19:27,356 --> 00:19:30,716
because the director is crazy.

151
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:32,556
Which piece are you rehearsing?

152
00:19:34,036 --> 00:19:35,396
None.

153
00:19:37,436 --> 00:19:41,275
Is that the title?
-No no...

154
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:45,834
We write the text ourselves.

155
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:50,634
We have to write to him.
We are all living writers.

156
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:53,994
Interesting.
-Yes, that's what he says.

157
00:19:54,154 --> 00:19:57,834
He lets us improvise...

158
00:19:57,994 --> 00:20:01,034
...and get everything out of ourselves,
those kind of things.

159
00:20:01,193 --> 00:20:04,154
And then he writes everything down.
And we are supposed...

160
00:20:04,313 --> 00:20:09,753
...to reveal all of our inner self.
But I prefer not to talk about myself.

161
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:12,352
He wants us to talk to people...

162
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:16,032
...and thus absorb emotional material.
This is what he calls it:

163
00:20:16,193 --> 00:20:17,952
Emotional material.

164
00:20:18,992 --> 00:20:20,352
That's an oxymoron.

165
00:20:21,912 --> 00:20:26,551
That's why I spoke to that man
with those tattoos on, but he thought...

166
00:20:26,712 --> 00:20:30,711
Everyone always misunderstands me.

167
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:35,991
'I live in fear
that I am not misunderstood.'

168
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,470
That's from Oscar Wilde.

169
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:46,829
Yolande, what are you doing here?
He drives us all crazy.

170
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:49,510
It is your turn.
-Okay, damn it.

171
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:54,869
Back to the madhouse. Bye.

172
00:21:02,547 --> 00:21:05,188
I'm going to Italy next week.
-Italy or the Vatican?

173
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:08,867
No, Italy.
-This is the perfect book for that.

174
00:21:09,027 --> 00:21:10,388
Thank you.
-Have a nice trip.

175
00:21:10,547 --> 00:21:12,947
Good evening. Bye.

176
00:21:14,386 --> 00:21:17,827
Father Matthieu, your flowers are ready.
-Beautiful.

177
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:22,146
Nice day.
-To you too.

178
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,467
You need to breathe, Albertine.

179
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:35,345
To breathe. Otherwise your lungs will become lazy.
You understand?

180
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:41,623
Breathe, honey. Think of the wind.

181
00:21:41,743 --> 00:21:43,464
Think of the sea.

182
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:48,024
Think of Corsica.
Do you remember the Street of Bonifacio?

183
00:21:48,184 --> 00:21:50,944
I caught you just in time.

184
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:58,423
Shall we rent a boat in June,
if no one is there?

185
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:02,903
Then you take the helm
and I hoist the mainsail.

186
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:06,102
I can still do something crazy, right?

187
00:22:07,902 --> 00:22:10,461
Just the two of us.

188
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:12,022
You, me and the sea.

189
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:19,580
You don't have to go anywhere
to be afraid of, dear.

190
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:42,299
I quit this theater group,
I don't fit in.

191
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:46,778
I replaced the director's girlfriend.

192
00:22:46,939 --> 00:22:49,618
In an argument, she threw
half the scenery towards him.

193
00:22:49,778 --> 00:22:53,897
That was the only decent scene.
The rest was a disaster.

194
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:56,897
I was a passerby
he grabbed my arm...

195
00:22:57,058 --> 00:22:58,777
...and put me on stage:

196
00:22:58,937 --> 00:23:02,698
You are no longer a passerby,
you now have the main role.

197
00:23:02,856 --> 00:23:08,616
Many great careers have started
with a substitution.

198
00:23:08,777 --> 00:23:11,577
Do I have an ugly voice?
-No, why?

199
00:23:18,615 --> 00:23:22,256
No I have not
sat on your muesli.

200
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:26,775
I did the dishes,
you take out the trash.

201
00:23:26,936 --> 00:23:30,454
Of course it stinks, you smoke.

202
00:23:31,654 --> 00:23:35,534
Get some, bitch.
My roommate.

203
00:23:37,774 --> 00:23:40,133
You do smoke.

204
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,973
She's really crazy. A vegan.

205
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:48,613
I have part of the refrigerator,
and when I get home, I'm hungry.

206
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:52,813
Then I see that they are all eggs
and ate the foie gras.

207
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,532
The vegan?
-Yes

208
00:23:54,691 --> 00:23:59,052
At least during the day.
In the evening she even eats rats.

209
00:24:00,532 --> 00:24:02,651
I cried last night.

210
00:24:04,253 --> 00:24:07,492
This is not a very nice time for me.

211
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,690
And then with this weather,
that doesn't help either.

212
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:15,491
I'm waiting for the spring
then I always live.

213
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,649
Can you recommend a book?
I'm not much of a reader...

214
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:39,409
Please.

215
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:42,688
Foam of the Days, Boris Vian.

216
00:24:47,327 --> 00:24:49,848
Looks good...
But it's too thick.

217
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:52,567
I am dyslexic,
I learned to read late.

218
00:24:52,687 --> 00:24:56,006
Aren't you either
a bit of a liar?

219
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:04,206
I like to make things a little more beautiful.
I clean them up a bit.

220
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:07,406
Something short, for the subway.
-Short?

221
00:25:07,566 --> 00:25:10,565
I never finish books
it drives me crazy.

222
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:15,365
How many stops do you need?
-Three.

223
00:25:22,043 --> 00:25:24,323
MARGUERITE YOURCENAR
'THE 33 NAMES OF GOD'

224
00:25:45,882 --> 00:25:47,562
Here's your book back.

225
00:25:47,722 --> 00:25:50,682
Did you read it in three stops?

226
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:55,081
"The hand that touches things."
Beautiful.

227
00:25:55,201 --> 00:25:59,400
I never know what to do with my hands.
Should they participate or not?

228
00:25:59,562 --> 00:26:02,881
Try to keep them quiet.
-I can not do that...

229
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:06,800
I don't know if it's a tic
but I can't.

230
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:10,080
I know nothing about theatre,
but imagine...

231
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,399
that someone is holding them behind your back.
-Yes, I'll try.

232
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,319
Bye.
-Bye.

233
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,799
Hold my hands.

234
00:26:25,158 --> 00:26:26,399
What?

235
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,719
Take my hands.

236
00:26:30,878 --> 00:26:32,918
What?
 Grab them.

237
00:26:33,078 --> 00:26:34,958
Grab them tightly.

238
00:26:35,118 --> 00:26:36,317
What?

239
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:42,596
Hector...

240
00:26:42,757 --> 00:26:47,397
Hector, my dear, my lover...
-Take it easy.

241
00:26:47,557 --> 00:26:50,916
All those promises
like candles in the night...

242
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,516
And then nothing,
total darkness, emptiness.

243
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:58,436
I need time to know
if you are really the woman for me.

244
00:26:58,596 --> 00:27:01,635
I'm lost, I've lost you.

245
00:27:01,795 --> 00:27:03,835
You are too much for me.

246
00:27:03,996 --> 00:27:05,556
Wait...

247
00:27:05,715 --> 00:27:09,595
I'm not asking you to wait for me.
You have your own life.

248
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:11,674
I'm happy when it's you.

249
00:27:11,834 --> 00:27:14,473
I'm happy when it's you.

250
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:18,994
Is that bad?

251
00:27:19,154 --> 00:27:22,593
Damn, damn.

252
00:27:23,553 --> 00:27:24,953
It's nothing.

253
00:27:25,114 --> 00:27:27,634
All your gossip stories.

254
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:29,752
I believed all your chatter.

255
00:27:33,873 --> 00:27:35,992
And then you said:

256
00:27:36,152 --> 00:27:39,112
I'll see you next year
on the Pont Neuf.

257
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:44,031
I went to the Pont Neuf every day.

258
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:47,792
Every day, I can't help it.

259
00:27:47,951 --> 00:27:49,510
I can not help it.
-Stop.

260
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,750
Why didn’t you take the dog
with you to Mozambique?

261
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,311
Why didn't you take him?

262
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:58,270
And now Boubou has run away.

263
00:27:58,431 --> 00:28:00,950
No one feels safe with me.

264
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,269
And I'm just waiting
and get more and more illusions.

265
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:10,069
You are a very good actress.

266
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:12,348
Thank you.

267
00:28:13,508 --> 00:28:16,109
Want another book to read?

268
00:28:16,229 --> 00:28:18,709
Yes, a thin book.
-Okay.

269
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:26,508
White Nights by Dostoevsky.
Are you kidding me?

270
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,986
'Suddenly I stopped,
like I was petrified.

271
00:28:33,148 --> 00:28:37,707
I heard a muffled sob.
I was not mistaken.

272
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:42,707
The girl cried and a minute later
I heard another sob.

273
00:28:42,866 --> 00:28:45,386
Dear me. It weighed heavily on me.

274
00:28:45,546 --> 00:28:50,985
I was always shy around women,
but this was a special moment.

275
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:56,824
I stepped towards her
and should have said: Madam.

276
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,905
If I hadn't known that statement...

277
00:29:00,064 --> 00:29:02,625
...has been done a thousand times already...

278
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:07,784
...in every Russian novel
about the upper classes.'

279
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:09,858
Vincenzo?
-Yes?

280
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,259
May I ask you something?
-Naturally.

281
00:30:13,857 --> 00:30:18,578
My mother kept a diary for years.

282
00:30:18,737 --> 00:30:21,097
Nothing important...

283
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:24,577
Notes, secrets, recipes...

284
00:30:24,738 --> 00:30:30,576
How to store basil in winter,
flowers in the house...

285
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:35,616
And further thoughts,
modest but sharp.

286
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,056
I want to bind it.

287
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:40,935
How do you want to bind it?
-No idea.

288
00:30:41,096 --> 00:30:43,535
Does it have a title?
-No.

289
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:48,455
Boat leather is...
Albertine can't go on like this.

290
00:30:50,694 --> 00:30:55,294
Why don't you talk to your daughter?
-My daughter doesn't talk.

291
00:30:56,774 --> 00:31:01,293
She is eloquent. Selective mutism.

292
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:04,053
She has no brain damage.

293
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:07,612
It's a blockage.
She's not over the trauma.

294
00:31:07,772 --> 00:31:11,852
I'm here to subject myself 
to her traumas.

295
00:31:11,973 --> 00:31:13,172
I'm always there.

296
00:31:14,692 --> 00:31:17,772
She needs to go back to college
to friends.

297
00:31:17,931 --> 00:31:21,612
She can live an almost normal life.
-Normal?

298
00:31:21,772 --> 00:31:25,532
What is normal for the spider,
is hell for the fly.

299
00:31:26,492 --> 00:31:27,851
Do not you think?

300
00:31:30,091 --> 00:31:32,130
Is your mother...

301
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,010
She's still alive.

302
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,530
But yesterday she asked me
to make love to her.

303
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,970
She no longer recognizes anyone.

304
00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:50,769
You're getting older, Vincenzo.

305
00:31:51,928 --> 00:31:55,929
Albertine also has a life
when you're gone.

306
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:58,089
Think about her future.

307
00:32:01,007 --> 00:32:05,608
I know Albertine
means everything to you.

308
00:32:05,768 --> 00:32:08,728
No, you don't know anything.
-Yes.

309
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:11,727
I know she is very intelligent.

310
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:15,766
I know if there is power
going through her body...

311
00:32:16,846 --> 00:32:18,446
...her muscles respond.

312
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:23,646
Who's your hairdresser, Gérard?

313
00:33:56,478 --> 00:33:59,397
Yesterday he humiliated me again.

314
00:33:59,557 --> 00:34:04,076
'Why are you pretending?
Try to be your worthless self.”

315
00:34:04,237 --> 00:34:07,156
Then he picked up a newspaper
and went to the toilet.

316
00:34:15,836 --> 00:34:19,036
But that fool is right.

317
00:34:19,196 --> 00:34:23,875
I will never play the leading role.
I remain a passerby.

318
00:34:24,035 --> 00:34:27,754
But you're a great actress.
Last time...

319
00:34:28,995 --> 00:34:32,434
When I held your wrists
you were incredible.

320
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:36,674
But that was a real story.

321
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,554
Hector didn't trust me.

322
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:58,033
Maybe he was right.
-Or maybe he was scared.

323
00:34:58,192 --> 00:34:59,671
Vincenzo...

324
00:35:01,072 --> 00:35:02,992
My life is full of illusions...

325
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:05,871
...and I multiply it
like soap bubbles.

326
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,431
You're an artist, Yolande.

327
00:35:12,592 --> 00:35:17,229
And illusion is the most important
in art.

328
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:22,910
Yes, but not in life.
In life...

329
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,590
...I feel ridiculous.

330
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,549
Because you are brave.

331
00:35:30,709 --> 00:35:35,749
You must dare to be ridiculous
to reach the sublime.

332
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:40,228
Come on, Yolande. Try to be yourself.

333
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,828
Look at what you have.

334
00:35:44,348 --> 00:35:46,587
But I have nothing.

335
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:49,067
You're stupid for saying that.

336
00:35:50,787 --> 00:35:52,747
You are talented.

337
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:07,266
Who's up there?

338
00:36:10,906 --> 00:36:15,185
You're right. I will go take a look
to what I have at my toes.

339
00:36:23,904 --> 00:36:25,745
Does she live here now?

340
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:27,178
This relationship with the dead
keeps me alive.

341
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,499
The present kills us.

342
00:37:29,658 --> 00:37:31,378
What does that mean?

343
00:37:53,655 --> 00:37:56,376
Are you looking for something special?

344
00:37:56,535 --> 00:37:59,256
Yes, the story of an old fart.

345
00:38:00,776 --> 00:38:01,975
Excuse me?

346
00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:05,975
Who plays the intellectual,
but in fact is a pig.

347
00:38:06,135 --> 00:38:07,895
That every woman wants to fuck.

348
00:38:08,054 --> 00:38:12,534
Then there is a lot of choice: Victor Hugo, Simenon.

349
00:38:12,695 --> 00:38:14,294
Bukowski.

350
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,934
Philip Roth too.

351
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,895
Phillip Roth?
-Yes.

352
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:21,334
Leave her alone.

353
00:38:22,653 --> 00:38:27,053
Excuse me?
 Yolande is my wife. Okay?

354
00:38:27,213 --> 00:38:30,732
Where do you take her?
In there? In your bookstore?

355
00:38:31,453 --> 00:38:34,533
Roxane, the books.
-Are you taking her in there?

356
00:38:39,892 --> 00:38:41,692
Does she get books for sex?

357
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,572
Who are you?

358
00:38:48,931 --> 00:38:50,570
Who I am?

359
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:53,971
I'll slap you on your face.

360
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,570
How did you seduce her?

361
00:38:56,731 --> 00:38:58,570
Does she blow you?

362
00:38:58,729 --> 00:39:01,970
He must have shriveled up.
You can't get it up anymore.

363
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,730
Listen... Get up and listen.

364
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,410
Look at me, asshole. Listen.

365
00:39:07,569 --> 00:39:12,009
If I see you with her again,
I'll set the whole fucking bookstore on fire.

366
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,088
Asshole.

367
00:39:28,528 --> 00:39:31,128
Jerome is a good guy
but stupid.

368
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:33,327
He always gets tricked.

369
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:36,806
Are you ready, honey?
Do you need help?

370
00:39:40,207 --> 00:39:43,125
When I cleaned
at the Palais des Congress...

371
00:39:43,287 --> 00:39:45,567
...I had him on my back.

372
00:39:45,726 --> 00:39:49,365
Then I sat on my broom
to make him laugh.

373
00:39:49,526 --> 00:39:50,765
Here, honey.

374
00:39:50,926 --> 00:39:54,805
I have an Ashanti doll for you,
that brings good luck.

375
00:39:54,965 --> 00:39:58,045
I said to Jerome:
We are integrated.

376
00:39:58,205 --> 00:40:02,684
I work for a beautiful woman
who loves me like her mother.

377
00:40:02,804 --> 00:40:07,364
But he is angry with the whole world.
God forgive me.

378
00:40:08,724 --> 00:40:11,004
Soon he will be just like his father.

379
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:43,800
Your daughter is angry. She doesn’t even want 
to wash her armpits. Something is bothering her.

380
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,321
Maybe she's getting her period again?
-No, that's too easy.

381
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,760
If a woman is grumpy,
you always think it's because of that.

382
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:55,280
Did you do something stupid?

383
00:40:55,438 --> 00:40:56,999
What?

384
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,840
You make such a face...

385
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:03,999
What kind of face?

386
00:42:00,994 --> 00:42:03,074
'Don't die, master.

387
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:05,633
Follow my advice and live many more years.

388
00:42:06,153 --> 00:42:11,592
The dumbest thing a man can do
in this life...

389
00:42:15,553 --> 00:42:18,992
...is to die without resisting, Albertine.'

390
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:23,192
'Without anyone killing him.

391
00:42:23,352 --> 00:42:26,750
Only the melancholy
and the depression.'

392
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,310
"Come on, don't be lazy.

393
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:38,270
Get up from your bed and…

394
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:49,150
And maybe,
somewhere behind a bush...

395
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:52,389
...we find the lady Dulcinea.'

396
00:43:33,145 --> 00:43:35,185
What did Alan say?

397
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:41,904
He is crazy.

398
00:43:43,784 --> 00:43:45,624
It's the cocaine.

399
00:43:45,785 --> 00:43:48,864
The cocaine and the gym.

400
00:43:52,662 --> 00:43:54,984
Hopefully he didn't hurt you.

401
00:43:55,104 --> 00:43:57,263
I defended myself.

402
00:44:00,982 --> 00:44:03,263
He means nothing to me.

403
00:44:04,822 --> 00:44:08,823
We have maybe
slept together twice.

404
00:44:08,981 --> 00:44:10,542
Emotional material?

405
00:44:10,702 --> 00:44:12,423
No, sex.

406
00:44:21,461 --> 00:44:24,261
I left him.

407
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,460
We were never actually a couple.

408
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,779
I'm sorry,
I only cause problems.

409
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:33,979
No worries, no problem.

410
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:36,140
Good night.

411
00:45:14,736 --> 00:45:17,175
My bag... I need that.

412
00:45:39,693 --> 00:45:40,974
Good night.

413
00:45:44,093 --> 00:45:46,772
What Alain said is true.

414
00:45:48,013 --> 00:45:50,893
I can't stay away from you
Vincenzo.

415
00:45:52,972 --> 00:45:55,533
Please, Yolande.

416
00:45:56,492 --> 00:45:58,451
You have to believe me.

417
00:45:59,531 --> 00:46:03,331
You never tell the truth.
-Always, I never lie.

418
00:46:06,091 --> 00:46:08,490
Can I have a seat?

419
00:46:08,651 --> 00:46:11,891
I'm exhausted,
I haven't slept for two days.

420
00:46:25,809 --> 00:46:31,168
Remember when you said 
I had to look at what was inside me?

421
00:46:32,728 --> 00:46:34,889
I closed my eyes...

422
00:46:35,049 --> 00:46:38,568
...and saw you. I dreamed of you.

423
00:46:38,728 --> 00:46:43,928
No, no dreams, please.
No dreams.

424
00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:45,847
Do you know what I dreamed of?

425
00:46:53,126 --> 00:46:55,406
That we were in the bumper cars.

426
00:46:55,526 --> 00:46:59,687
Wonderful, that was years ago.

427
00:46:59,846 --> 00:47:03,686
You were very good
and kept bumping into me.

428
00:47:03,846 --> 00:47:05,446
Time after time.

429
00:47:05,606 --> 00:47:08,525
I was shaken
and couldn’t stop laughing.

430
00:47:11,086 --> 00:47:12,684
I woke up laughing.

431
00:47:12,805 --> 00:47:16,485
But then I burst into tears.

432
00:47:16,605 --> 00:47:17,844
As usual.

433
00:47:43,043 --> 00:47:44,442
Vincenzo...

434
00:47:45,402 --> 00:47:48,042
You live in one place
which is outside this world.

435
00:47:50,203 --> 00:47:52,722
I feel so happy here.

436
00:47:57,561 --> 00:48:00,680
You don't care about me at all, do you?

437
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,281
No you...

438
00:48:03,601 --> 00:48:05,801
You are a good customer.

439
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,880
Not at all, I rarely read anything.

440
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,279
That's because I'm there
quickly enough.

441
00:48:16,439 --> 00:48:19,399
I have too many thoughts
and can't concentrate.

442
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:27,239
Would you like to go out with me?

443
00:48:27,399 --> 00:48:30,398
What?
-We can go out to dinner.

444
00:48:30,518 --> 00:48:33,158
You don't have to pay
I pay for myself.

445
00:48:33,318 --> 00:48:36,158
That's how we always do it in the theater.

446
00:48:36,278 --> 00:48:41,437
Unless you invite me.
-Of course I invite you.

447
00:48:41,597 --> 00:48:42,797
Yes?
-No.

448
00:48:42,957 --> 00:48:45,477
No?
-Yes, no.

449
00:48:50,757 --> 00:48:52,676
Are you married, Vincenzo?

450
00:48:56,956 --> 00:48:58,596
Divorced.

451
00:49:00,955 --> 00:49:04,634
That's a good thing
because I bring bad luck.

452
00:49:18,035 --> 00:49:19,914
It's cold.

453
00:49:20,074 --> 00:49:22,393
Do you have a blanket?

454
00:49:22,553 --> 00:49:23,794
Yes.

455
00:50:31,108 --> 00:50:34,187
She lost her dog
but has found her owner.

456
00:50:46,546 --> 00:50:49,665
Is that a corpse?
Did you kill someone?

457
00:50:49,826 --> 00:50:53,145
If you have to get rid of the body,
Jerome has friends.

458
00:50:53,305 --> 00:50:55,826
Well integrated guys.

459
00:50:55,984 --> 00:50:57,865
But it will cost you something.

460
00:51:02,185 --> 00:51:05,304
Bring chamomile tea next time
for your friend.

461
00:51:13,663 --> 00:51:17,463
Who is that terrorist?
Are you putting her in the window?

462
00:51:30,261 --> 00:51:32,663
I have not slept so well in ages.

463
00:51:40,942 --> 00:51:42,861
Good morning.

464
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,061
Good morning.

465
00:52:02,979 --> 00:52:05,338
I need to go to the toilet.

466
00:52:05,499 --> 00:52:08,819
No no no. Excuse me.

467
00:52:08,979 --> 00:52:12,418
The toilet is there.
-Okay.

468
00:52:15,378 --> 00:52:16,857
That will cost money.

469
00:52:17,018 --> 00:52:20,217
See how she devours that croissant?
Like Marie-Antoinette.

470
00:52:20,377 --> 00:52:22,098
Get out of here, Clemente.

471
00:53:07,853 --> 00:53:09,772
Then I'll go again.

472
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:13,572
I have dress rehearsal.

473
00:53:13,693 --> 00:53:15,212
Fingers crossed.

474
00:53:23,972 --> 00:53:25,371
No.

475
00:54:00,129 --> 00:54:02,208
Is that...

476
00:54:02,368 --> 00:54:03,728
Is that your daughter?

477
00:54:05,967 --> 00:54:07,167
Yes.

478
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:12,527
I'm sorry.

479
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:15,087
I'm too impulsive, so stupid.

480
00:54:16,726 --> 00:54:18,927
I thought you had a woman there.

481
00:54:19,087 --> 00:54:22,007
Go, Yolanda. Please, leave.

482
00:54:28,845 --> 00:54:32,006
Does your daughter never go out?

483
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:39,284
I understand her.

484
00:54:39,445 --> 00:54:41,324
What's outside?

485
00:54:41,485 --> 00:54:43,244
Not much.

486
00:54:46,364 --> 00:54:49,084
A few lights...

487
00:54:49,243 --> 00:54:50,764
...and a lot of noise.

488
00:55:02,483 --> 00:55:03,963
Dear...

489
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:05,722
Dear Vincenzo.

490
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,600
It's enough like this.

491
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:40,279
Dear Professor.

492
00:55:41,439 --> 00:55:42,798
Please.
-Excuse me?

493
00:55:42,959 --> 00:55:46,118
It's enough now. Stop stealing.

494
00:55:46,279 --> 00:55:49,559
You have to pay for that book.
Do you understand?

495
00:55:49,718 --> 00:55:52,439
You have to pay for it.
Go away, please.

496
00:55:52,598 --> 00:55:55,357
"Every attraction is mutual."

497
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,918
Of course, but you have to pay.

498
00:56:00,277 --> 00:56:01,957
Piss off.

499
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:36,554
'Get lost. That's life.'

500
00:56:39,434 --> 00:56:42,913
"May everyone be blessed."

501
00:56:43,753 --> 00:56:45,992
'Damn.'

502
00:59:39,498 --> 00:59:43,377
What were you like as a child?
-I don't remember, that was a long time ago.

503
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:46,777
I can imagine.
-How was I then?

504
00:59:46,936 --> 00:59:51,576
Some people change a lot.
Others don't, like you.

505
00:59:51,736 --> 00:59:53,535
How do you know that?

506
00:59:53,697 --> 00:59:56,776
I would recognize you in a group of children.

507
00:59:56,896 --> 01:00:00,096
How?
-From your eyes and your nose.

508
01:00:00,256 --> 01:00:03,175
My nose used to be much smaller.

509
01:00:05,855 --> 01:00:09,135
You don't like to talk about yourself.
-No, that's boring.

510
01:00:09,295 --> 01:00:11,615
When I look in the mirror, I think:

511
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,695
Who is that guy?
They call me the misanthrope.

512
01:00:16,054 --> 01:00:18,374
Do you know what they called me?
Porcupine.

513
01:00:18,534 --> 01:00:20,694
Porcupine?
-Yes.

514
01:00:20,814 --> 01:00:21,974
Why?

515
01:00:22,133 --> 01:00:25,693
Because I poked everyone
who got too close.

516
01:01:48,925 --> 01:01:52,685
And your daughter?
You never talk about her.

517
01:01:52,845 --> 01:01:55,526
I live for her, period.

518
01:01:57,044 --> 01:01:58,485
She's my star.

519
01:02:03,885 --> 01:02:06,685
And her mother?
-He left for New York.

520
01:02:06,844 --> 01:02:10,324
She lives there with another man,
a writer.

521
01:02:13,843 --> 01:02:18,923
Back then I lived 
like most married men: alone.

522
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:21,283
I rarely saw Albertine.

523
01:02:21,443 --> 01:02:25,243
She had her own life
she went to school.

524
01:02:25,403 --> 01:02:28,882
She was always good, a perfectionist.

525
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:32,922
She always wanted her perfection
show to the whole world.

526
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,321
Just like her mother.

527
01:02:35,481 --> 01:02:38,962
She didn't respect me
but I didn't care.

528
01:02:39,082 --> 01:02:44,440
I'd rather be a big loser
than a mediocre winner.

529
01:02:47,001 --> 01:02:49,600
The whole divorce...

530
01:02:51,959 --> 01:02:53,440
...was awful.

531
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:57,280
Our house was full of poison and rage.

532
01:02:59,759 --> 01:03:03,639
That was four years ago.
Since...

533
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:11,277
...Albertine doesn't go out anymore.

534
01:03:11,438 --> 01:03:15,038
But one day she decided
to go swimming.

535
01:03:17,477 --> 01:03:21,397
She went over and climbed on the trampoline.

536
01:03:21,557 --> 01:03:23,677
But the pool was empty...

537
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,077
...and she fell.

538
01:03:30,236 --> 01:03:34,556
There were leaves on the bottom
and she fell on it.

539
01:03:34,716 --> 01:03:36,996
Despite everything, we were lucky.

540
01:04:08,913 --> 01:04:10,873
Shall we sleep together?

541
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:17,271
I shouldn't be here.
-But you're here.

542
01:04:21,351 --> 01:04:22,832
Do you know...

543
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:35,591
Giving up is not always defeat.

544
01:05:26,624 --> 01:05:28,946
I sold a book.

545
01:05:30,464 --> 01:05:33,584
Nice.
-It cost 18.56 euros.

546
01:05:33,745 --> 01:05:37,146
That jerk gave me 20 euros
and left with a chuckle.

547
01:05:37,304 --> 01:05:39,905
The 'Madame Bovary' from the shop window?

548
01:05:40,063 --> 01:05:42,785
Yes.
-I understand. 18.56...

549
01:05:42,943 --> 01:05:46,824
1856, that's the year
of that first edition.

550
01:05:48,102 --> 01:05:50,104
It was worth much more.

551
01:05:50,263 --> 01:05:55,463
That's why he was smiling for sure.
That bastard...

552
01:05:55,624 --> 01:05:58,143
Probably yes.

553
01:05:58,302 --> 01:05:59,862
But it's ok.

554
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:03,303
This is not a profitable business anyway.

555
01:06:03,461 --> 01:06:05,781
Wine, that's good business.

556
01:06:05,943 --> 01:06:09,340
Get rid of those books
and put wine there.

557
01:06:09,502 --> 01:06:13,222
Clear the shelves.
Leave a few books for the atmosphere.

558
01:06:13,382 --> 01:06:16,861
I know what people want.
They want to drink.

559
01:06:16,981 --> 01:06:19,141
They are nostalgic and melancholic.

560
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:22,660
And then those fatties,
Russians and Arabs...

561
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:26,941
...who drink 20,000 euro bottles
like it's water.

562
01:06:27,099 --> 01:06:28,701
Get rid of those books.

563
01:06:28,861 --> 01:06:32,498
You take care of the space
I for the taste. I help you.

564
01:06:32,661 --> 01:06:33,860
Vincenzo.

565
01:06:45,817 --> 01:06:48,258
Are you crying now because of Madame Bovary?

566
01:06:49,218 --> 01:06:52,098
You know what Flaubert said
on his deathbed?

567
01:06:53,419 --> 01:06:55,698
'I die...

568
01:06:55,858 --> 01:06:58,297
...and that whore will live forever.'

569
01:07:27,455 --> 01:07:28,856
Aren't you eating?

570
01:07:30,895 --> 01:07:33,414
You are not starving.

571
01:09:01,086 --> 01:09:02,125
Darling...

572
01:09:42,922 --> 01:09:44,683
So you are not pregnant.

573
01:09:45,643 --> 01:09:47,083
Nice.

574
01:09:53,042 --> 01:09:55,041
Come on, your gift.

575
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,319
Sit down.
-I can't, I have to box.

576
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:19,879
Then go fight.

577
01:10:31,878 --> 01:10:34,438
I feel something in my chest...

578
01:10:34,598 --> 01:10:38,038
...like a frog that perpetually
jumping around.

579
01:10:41,877 --> 01:10:45,957
You're right about Albertine.

580
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:48,236
I stop her.

581
01:10:50,396 --> 01:10:52,837
Open your shirt.

582
01:10:52,996 --> 01:10:55,917
As you take care of her
is impressive.

583
01:10:58,476 --> 01:11:01,116
I think Albertine is tired of me.

584
01:11:04,315 --> 01:11:07,834
It's time
that you live again.

585
01:11:07,995 --> 01:11:09,834
Or that you're going to live...

586
01:11:12,156 --> 01:11:13,554
...before you're too old.

587
01:11:15,875 --> 01:11:17,514
I'm afraid.

588
01:11:19,513 --> 01:11:21,234
Lift up your shirt.

589
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:26,554
Fear is the mother of regret.

590
01:11:26,714 --> 01:11:28,553
Take a deep breath.

591
01:11:30,313 --> 01:11:32,153
And if she does it again?

592
01:11:32,312 --> 01:11:35,992
If she takes a dip again?

593
01:11:36,153 --> 01:11:38,313
Life is an ambush.

594
01:11:38,472 --> 01:11:39,551
Cough once.

595
01:11:43,112 --> 01:11:44,871
You have nothing.

596
01:11:51,751 --> 01:11:55,310
I think suicide is a clumsy act.

597
01:11:55,472 --> 01:12:01,189
Anyone who commits suicide
would rather have killed another.

598
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:06,589
I have something for you.

599
01:12:11,709 --> 01:12:13,109
Thank you.

600
01:12:13,269 --> 01:12:16,349
Real cow leather.
-Beautiful.

601
01:12:16,508 --> 01:12:20,868
It had wine stains on it.
What was she drinking? Burgundy?

602
01:12:22,108 --> 01:12:27,348
No. Or sometimes.
But mostly simple wine.

603
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:31,867
Her life was less rosy
than described herein.

604
01:12:32,027 --> 01:12:36,546
I think she knew
that someday we'd find it...

605
01:12:36,707 --> 01:12:39,186
...and would read.

606
01:12:39,346 --> 01:12:41,907
So she embellished it a bit.

607
01:12:44,506 --> 01:12:46,586
Mothers teach us what love is.

608
01:12:52,984 --> 01:12:55,065
Wait a minute, Gerard.

609
01:12:55,226 --> 01:12:57,505
I met a woman.

610
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:00,385
It may not work out.
-Or maybe a lot.

611
01:13:00,545 --> 01:13:02,465
An actress.
-It does not matter.

612
01:13:02,624 --> 01:13:07,263
I don't want Albertine to think...
-She knows you love her.

613
01:13:14,103 --> 01:13:15,864
Hello Vincenzo.
-Hello.

614
01:13:19,263 --> 01:13:20,702
Columbus.

615
01:13:20,862 --> 01:13:23,143
Have you bought sanitary napkins?

616
01:13:24,702 --> 01:13:28,021
Keep to your coffins,
women take care of life.

617
01:13:28,182 --> 01:13:31,222
Everything okay, Vincenzo?
-Yes.

618
01:13:36,462 --> 01:13:38,100
FOR YOLANDE

619
01:13:40,221 --> 01:13:42,301
MARGUERITE YOURCENAR
'THE 33 NAMES OF GOD'

620
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,060
Closed

621
01:14:05,739 --> 01:14:07,419
Good evening, Albertine.

622
01:14:08,938 --> 01:14:11,738
I brought you something.

623
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:17,498
That's for stars
to project along, see?

624
01:14:20,138 --> 01:14:24,297
That madman wanted it first for our piece
but then no more.

625
01:14:24,457 --> 01:14:26,497
No more stars, he said.

626
01:14:26,617 --> 01:14:30,896
Tonight is the big night for me.
The premiere.

627
01:14:31,057 --> 01:14:32,856
Wish me good luck.

628
01:14:52,534 --> 01:14:56,974
What is this?
Did you recreate all of Paris?

629
01:14:57,135 --> 01:15:00,214
In miniature. How cute.

630
01:15:00,374 --> 01:15:03,734
Are they father and mother fish?
Or a brother and sister?

631
01:15:04,813 --> 01:15:07,693
Look. They are in love, yes.

632
01:15:18,892 --> 01:15:22,693
Do you know...
I also have panic attacks.

633
01:15:25,131 --> 01:15:28,211
In the evening, when the curtain rises...

634
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:30,451
...I'm afraid I can't say anything.

635
01:15:30,611 --> 01:15:32,451
But then I say something anyway.

636
01:15:37,131 --> 01:15:39,131
We have to.

637
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:42,410
People have paid.

638
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:47,050
So you talk. Blah, blah, blah.
Everyone plays their part.

639
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:49,729
We must.

640
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:52,889
You have to do something with your gifts.

641
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:09,208
Good evening, Vincenzo.
-Hello, Father Matthieu.

642
01:16:13,247 --> 01:16:15,887
I'll take your roses to the theater.

643
01:16:53,243 --> 01:16:57,363
Once upon a time there was a loving family
of porcupines.

644
01:16:57,523 --> 01:17:01,562
On a cold night they crawled
close together to get warm.

645
01:17:01,723 --> 01:17:05,602
But after a while
their spines started to hurt.

646
01:17:05,763 --> 01:17:07,242
So they broke up.

647
01:17:07,402 --> 01:17:11,601
But then they got cold again.

648
01:17:13,121 --> 01:17:15,082
So they huddled together again.

649
01:17:17,162 --> 01:17:20,641
Then they felt the pain 
from the spines again.

650
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:26,920
They were in between two discomforts:
 cold and pain all night.

651
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:31,201
That went on until 
they found the right distance.

652
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:33,319
The ideal position.

653
01:17:34,959 --> 01:17:39,359
Schopenhauer's Porcupine Dilemma.
Heard of it?

654
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:44,239
I always read the advice on happiness.

655
01:17:49,438 --> 01:17:52,878
THEATER OF PROVIDENCE

656
01:18:40,594 --> 01:18:42,273
Damn.

657
01:18:43,514 --> 01:18:46,074
There are a lot of people.

658
01:18:46,233 --> 01:18:47,672
I'm late.

659
01:18:50,113 --> 01:18:52,752
Heaven always opens to a star.

660
01:18:55,193 --> 01:18:57,312
Cut the onions...

661
01:18:57,472 --> 01:18:59,633
...and fruit them...

662
01:18:59,792 --> 01:19:01,632
...in a little oil.

663
01:19:01,792 --> 01:19:03,353
Turn off the fire.

664
01:19:03,511 --> 01:19:07,151
Add some parsley
and cut the sardines.

665
01:20:52,062 --> 01:20:54,222
Yolande, Yolande.

666
01:20:54,342 --> 01:20:57,141
How did it go?
-We were booed.

667
01:20:57,261 --> 01:20:59,102
That was to be expected.

668
01:20:59,261 --> 01:21:02,900
I have a lot to tell you.

669
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:07,181
I'm a little vague
but in my mind everything is clear.

670
01:21:07,341 --> 01:21:09,860
Come with me.
-He's back.

671
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:14,740
Boubou? I told you
that dogs always come back.

672
01:21:14,899 --> 01:21:18,379
Hector.
He has kept his promise.

673
01:21:20,339 --> 01:21:24,059
He was in first rank
and just looked at me.

674
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:27,338
I was so nervous
I was drooling all over.

675
01:21:27,498 --> 01:21:30,859
When I saw him
I thought I was going to pass out.

676
01:21:31,018 --> 01:21:32,618
My hands were frozen.

677
01:21:32,745 --> 01:21:35,065
I thought he was laughing at me...

678
01:21:35,218 --> 01:21:37,817
...but suddenly I saw something in the fog.

679
01:21:37,978 --> 01:21:39,897
I felt a power...

680
01:21:40,058 --> 01:21:43,418
As if hope itself
sat there in front of me.

681
01:21:45,057 --> 01:21:49,377
Vincenzo, I played like never before.

682
01:21:50,856 --> 01:21:53,377
Like a boat that effortlessly
sails through the waters.

683
01:21:53,536 --> 01:21:55,816
I literally flew.

684
01:21:57,135 --> 01:21:58,975
He came to my dressing room...

685
01:21:59,136 --> 01:22:02,055
...and I realized that I always
had been waiting for him.

686
01:22:02,215 --> 01:22:03,975
Vincenzo...

687
01:22:04,136 --> 01:22:07,094
Illusions support our wings.

688
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:12,055
It doesn't matter if I regret tomorrow, 
I’m happy now.

689
01:22:12,175 --> 01:22:14,574
When I least expected it.

690
01:22:16,934 --> 01:22:18,853
We leave tonight.

691
01:22:19,013 --> 01:22:21,533
He's going on tour.
Nice right?

692
01:22:25,093 --> 01:22:26,533
So...

693
01:22:28,013 --> 01:22:30,293
I've come to say goodbye.

694
01:22:34,492 --> 01:22:38,492
And... Did you want to hear about Boubou?

695
01:22:38,652 --> 01:22:41,531
The whole neighborhood wants to know
how Boubou is.

696
01:22:42,531 --> 01:22:46,331
Hector found him one morning
in front of his door.

697
01:22:49,091 --> 01:22:51,730
That dog is so sensitive.

698
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:56,611
Yolande...

699
01:22:56,771 --> 01:22:58,770
We go.
-He's waiting for me.

700
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:01,610
Won't you forget me?

701
01:23:03,931 --> 01:23:05,889
Me you neither.

702
01:23:07,290 --> 01:23:09,649
OK, I have to go.

703
01:23:15,008 --> 01:23:16,728
The thorns.

704
01:23:46,846 --> 01:23:49,006
Wish me luck.

705
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:00,525
I love you.

706
01:25:08,679 --> 01:25:12,158
Thanks, Alan.
-You were great.

707
01:25:12,319 --> 01:25:14,198
You're a great actress.

708
01:25:14,357 --> 01:25:18,559
You were good the other day too.
-No, I'm an amateur.

709
01:25:18,718 --> 01:25:20,838
Why are you leaving him like this?

710
01:25:21,997 --> 01:25:23,557
That poor man.

711
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:27,798
You're crazy about him.
Giving up isn't always defeat.

712
01:25:30,676 --> 01:25:32,197
Here.

713
01:25:38,795 --> 01:25:41,755
Caught in the theater?
 Your butt is important.

714
01:25:42,875 --> 01:25:45,034
That's true. Bye.

715
01:25:46,314 --> 01:25:49,515
Where are you sleeping tonight?
-I'll find something.

716
01:25:51,473 --> 01:25:55,434
Drive carefully and do not use drugs.

717
01:25:55,594 --> 01:25:57,274
Yolande?

718
01:26:01,074 --> 01:26:02,753
Are you okay?

719
01:26:07,034 --> 01:26:09,034
You will hear that tomorrow.

720
01:28:17,381 --> 01:28:20,102
Good morning, Hector.
