WKCC AM Talk Radio.
All talk, all the time.

2
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:11,328
Bringing you sports and Weather
on the five.

3
00:00:16,813 --> 00:00:20,852
Church leaders blame the rise of hate
crimes and racially-motivated attacks...

4
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:23,886
...on a militia-like group
calling themselves "The Holnists. "

5
00:00:24,253 --> 00:00:26,483
One of the most radical and poWerful
of these groups...

6
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:29,964
...claims as its founder, the famed
motivational speaker Nathan Holn.

7
00:00:49,053 --> 00:00:50,930
The last of the great cities died...

8
00:00:51,173 --> 00:00:52,731
... When my father Was a child...

9
00:00:53,173 --> 00:00:55,448
... victims of yet another War.

10
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:58,249
He told of the plagues that folloWed...

11
00:00:58,613 --> 00:01:01,525
...and hoW the living hid themselves,
scattered in tiny hamlets...

12
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:04,492
...in hopes of surviving
Whatever neW madness...

13
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:07,406
...conspired to rob them
of the little that remained.

14
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,203
ln those days, he Walked alone...

15
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:14,089
...a solitary Witness
to the chaos that reigned.

16
00:01:15,413 --> 00:01:18,610
The earth itself had fallen victim
to the insanity.

17
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:21,004
He told stories of the 3-year Winter...

18
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:24,051
...and hoW the dirty snoW
never stopped falling.

19
00:01:25,013 --> 00:01:28,210
He saW the ocean,
barren, poisoned, near death.

20
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:31,570
And hoW they Watched the sky
for 16 long years...

21
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:34,731
...praying for the great lungs
to start Working again.

22
00:01:35,613 --> 00:01:39,731
He said it Was as if the ocean
had breathed a great sigh of relief.

23
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:20,165
Many commuters
are abandoning their vehicles.

24
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:52,404
Goddamn it, Bill!

25
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:56,808
You know l need to check it first.

26
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:08,092
l don't know.

27
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:11,250
Better than turpentine, Bill.

28
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:15,691
Tastes about the same.

29
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:18,808
What do you say?

30
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:20,323
Your call.

31
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:28,485
You ain't picky, Bill.

32
00:03:29,173 --> 00:03:31,050
l like that about you.

33
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:37,643
Things l like about my ass. . .

34
00:03:38,493 --> 00:03:39,892
. . .number 1 :

35
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:43,287
Will settle for turpentine.

36
00:04:48,613 --> 00:04:50,365
We got TV!

37
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:01,486
We got 1 47 channels, Bill.

38
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:04,010
We got everything from. . .

39
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:05,722
. . .Jesus to Jeopardy .

40
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:08,648
"Like. . .

41
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,970
. . .sands through the hourglass,
so are the days--. "

42
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:13,202
We'll watch that.

43
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:16,604
...sands through the hourglass,
so are the days of our lives.

44
00:05:16,853 --> 00:05:18,047
"Monday. "

45
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,205
"Monday night. "

46
00:05:22,453 --> 00:05:23,647
Monday-night football!

47
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:33,651
l don't want any trouble.

48
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:37,485
l bet you don't either.

49
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:42,244
Let's just call it a draw.

50
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:18,287
l'm rich!

51
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,846
l know the rule.

52
00:06:56,253 --> 00:06:57,732
lt's my rule.

53
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:00,727
"Avoid civilization at all cost. "

54
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:02,932
We got to eat, don't we?

55
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,686
Open your mouth.

56
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:09,447
lt's true we haven't done this
for awhile but. . .

57
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:13,129
. . .for God sakes,
it's like riding a bicycle, Bill.

58
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,930
What are you so worried about?

59
00:07:16,173 --> 00:07:18,403
All you got to do is stand there.

60
00:07:18,653 --> 00:07:20,803
l'm the one with all the lines.

61
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,971
Open up.

62
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,049
Awful.

63
00:07:30,293 --> 00:07:31,726
Just awful.

64
00:07:40,213 --> 00:07:41,851
They said, "Fear not, Macbeth. . .

65
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:44,365
. . .till Birnam Wood. . .

66
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:46,569
. . .comes to Dunsinane. "

67
00:07:54,653 --> 00:07:55,972
l said. . .

68
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:59,413
" . . .till Birnam Wood
comes to Dunsinane! "

69
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:04,206
Thank you.

70
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:08,967
Arm yourselves!

71
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:21,572
Arm yourselves.

72
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:25,088
lf the witch's words are true. . .

73
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,972
. . .there'll be no running,
hiding here!

74
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:30,488
We'll fight. . .

75
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:33,201
. . .as if our last meal
depended on it.

76
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:46,446
Tomorrow. . . .

77
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,891
And tomorrow. . . .

78
00:08:49,453 --> 00:08:50,169
Tomorrow.

79
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:52,642
And the day after that.

80
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:55,170
Out, brief candle!

81
00:08:55,573 --> 00:08:57,848
Life's but a walking shadow. . .

82
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:00,609
. . .a poor player who struts. . .

83
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:03,329
. . .and frets his hour upon a stage. . .

84
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:05,291
. . .and is heard no more.

85
00:09:07,653 --> 00:09:09,245
lt's a tale told by. . . .

86
00:09:09,493 --> 00:09:10,084
ldiot.

87
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,846
A moron. . .

88
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:15,127
. . .full of sound and fury. . .

89
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:17,491
. . .signifying. . .

90
00:09:18,853 --> 00:09:20,081
. . .nothing.

91
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:31,327
But blow, wind!

92
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:32,801
Come, wrack!

93
00:09:33,493 --> 00:09:34,892
At least we'll die. . .

94
00:09:36,213 --> 00:09:38,090
. . .with the harness off our back!

95
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:49,724
l want to talk to him.

96
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:03,726
The children have never seen
Shakespeare before.

97
00:10:04,093 --> 00:10:06,129
They still haven't.

98
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:08,966
Thank you.
You're very kind.

99
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:12,091
l'm clapping because you stink.

100
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,322
Larry!

101
00:10:13,573 --> 00:10:15,291
l don't think you know how it works.

102
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:19,162
When l was young, l tried to be
an actor. l was awful.

103
00:10:19,413 --> 00:10:23,042
But now l won't die thinking
l was the worst one.

104
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:24,328
-Stop it!
-That's all right.

105
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:27,007
How much did you pay to get in?

106
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:29,572
So bite me.

107
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:32,609
You were very good.

108
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:37,202
-Good enough to get something to eat?
-Yes, we have some soup.

109
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:52,408
Holnists. Goddamn!

110
00:10:56,373 --> 00:10:58,841
Bastards hardly kill anyone lately.

111
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:02,568
We give them food and supplies.

112
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:04,049
All the towns do.

113
00:11:04,653 --> 00:11:07,372
l'd just as soon not give them
anything of mine, thanks.

114
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:46,652
What are you doing there?

115
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:53,682
What are you doing?

116
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:00,926
lt's just a game, General Bethlehem.

117
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:03,968
lt's something they saw in a play.
No harm in it.

118
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:05,163
Wait a minute!

119
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:07,092
A play?

120
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:08,642
Show me.

121
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:14,810
lt's all right, children.
Show me.

122
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:18,082
Arm yourselves.

123
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,891
No running from the witches.

124
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:23,447
Shakespeare, is it?

125
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:26,685
l'm sorry l missed it.

126
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:30,209
We haven't nearly stocked the game
that we thought we would.

127
00:12:30,653 --> 00:12:32,484
Really?
But you had time for a play?

128
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:37,445
l'm taking 3 conscripts. . .

129
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:39,012
. . .from each town!

130
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:42,809
They will have the honor
of serving in the Holnist Army. . .

131
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,691
. . .until such time as l see fit!

132
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:45,570
3 men.

133
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:47,641
Could you do that?

134
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:50,763
Captain!

135
00:12:52,173 --> 00:12:53,845
All men. . .

136
00:12:54,093 --> 00:12:56,049
. . .between 1 5 and 50. . .

137
00:12:56,293 --> 00:13:00,684
. . .and of suitable ethnic foundation
are required to show themselves now!

138
00:13:07,173 --> 00:13:08,162
General.

139
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:13,964
No, but keep that.

140
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:32,127
Acceptable.

141
00:13:32,373 --> 00:13:33,283
Sir?

142
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:35,366
Acceptable, Captain.

143
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:37,922
Need some meat on you,
but l like an impressionable mind.

144
00:13:38,173 --> 00:13:39,401
Acceptable.

145
00:13:54,853 --> 00:13:55,968
Mongoloid.

146
00:13:56,213 --> 00:13:57,692
Unacceptable.

147
00:13:58,773 --> 00:14:00,331
l want pure blood.

148
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,891
Someone. . . .

149
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,527
Someone. . . .

150
00:14:07,453 --> 00:14:09,284
-Don't wave.
-Oeople, you will look at me!

151
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:12,961
Someone like. . . .

152
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,171
Like that man!

153
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:38,731
You don't understand.

154
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:40,890
You were required to show yourself.

155
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:43,772
l'm not with them.
l'm just passing through.

156
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,006
Take the mule.

157
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:30,526
Let's go! Move!

158
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:53,682
Ten-hut!

159
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:55,845
l want a line right here.

160
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:11,287
Welcome, gentlemen,
to your new life.

161
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:15,323
You have been born again as soldiers
in the United Army of Nathan Holn.

162
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:17,529
God rest his soul!

163
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:19,771
The strong have been sapped. . .

164
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:22,925
. . .by the whimpering propaganda
of the weak.

165
00:17:23,773 --> 00:17:24,888
Men. . .

166
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:28,373
. . .strong men,
have been denied their destiny.

167
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:31,047
You men have been saved
from that fate.

168
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,686
Redemption. . .

169
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,765
. . .is within your grasp.

170
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:45,042
You.

171
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:48,486
What did you do
before you were given this opportunity?

172
00:17:48,973 --> 00:17:51,248
l had a shovel.
l digged holes.

173
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:53,091
You digged holes.

174
00:17:54,893 --> 00:17:55,723
Now you'll fill them.

175
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:12,209
And you?

176
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:14,084
Me?

177
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:18,483
ls there any question in anyone's mind
that l was speaking to you?

178
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:20,212
Yes, you.

179
00:18:20,653 --> 00:18:22,211
l'm just a performer.

180
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:25,121
Shakespeare. Stuff like that.

181
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:26,723
Shakespeare?

182
00:18:27,093 --> 00:18:28,492
He was a writer.

183
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,686
Yes, l know.

184
00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:33,323
l know who Shakespeare was.

185
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:36,651
"Cry 'Havoc!' . . .

186
00:18:36,893 --> 00:18:38,246
. . .and let slip. . .

187
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,051
. . .the dogs of war. "

188
00:18:52,453 --> 00:18:53,772
Me?

189
00:18:56,373 --> 00:18:58,329
"To be or not to be:

190
00:18:59,093 --> 00:19:00,082
That is the question. "

191
00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:13,692
"We few. . .

192
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:15,127
. . .we happy few. . .

193
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:18,088
. . .we band of brothers! "

194
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:38,244
"Now is the winter of our discontent
made glorious summer. . .

195
00:19:38,493 --> 00:19:40,051
. . .by this sun of York. "

196
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,088
You're pretty good.

197
00:19:53,573 --> 00:19:56,531
You're also a fighter.
l can see it in your eyes.

198
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:00,604
You are a dangerous man.

199
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:02,283
Don't you agree?

200
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:06,003
No disrespect, sir,
but you'd be better off letting me go.

201
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:15,252
A fighter is
about the last thing that l am.

202
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,767
Don't you think l should be
the judge of that, soldier?

203
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:27,688
Get up.

204
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:29,082
l said, get up!

205
00:20:44,653 --> 00:20:46,325
You're right.
You're not a fighter.

206
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:48,892
But you will be.

207
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:50,805
l'm giving you a chance
at a life. . .

208
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:52,532
. . .that means something.

209
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:54,126
A life worth living.

210
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,644
-l'm glad to see you.
-We missed you.

211
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:01,651
-l missed you. Kurt, hoW are you?
-Hungry.

212
00:21:03,813 --> 00:21:06,407
-Gretl, What happened to your finger?
-lt got caught.

213
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:09,167
-Caught in What?
-Friedrich 's teeth.

214
00:21:21,653 --> 00:21:22,802
Thanks.

215
00:21:25,813 --> 00:21:27,644
Did l win?

216
00:21:30,293 --> 00:21:32,124
l tried to tell him.

217
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,482
Say it again.

218
00:21:37,693 --> 00:21:38,921
Say what?

219
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:41,690
Words you said in town.

220
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,845
About the wind blowing and the rest.
Say it again.

221
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,528
"Blow, wind.
Come, wrack.

222
00:21:49,013 --> 00:21:52,289
At least we'll die
with the harness off our back. "

223
00:21:53,973 --> 00:21:55,372
What's it mean?

224
00:21:57,573 --> 00:21:59,131
"Live free or. . .

225
00:21:59,373 --> 00:22:00,328
. . .die. "

226
00:22:00,573 --> 00:22:01,801
l think.

227
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:06,245
You're going to watch a movie
or you can sleep!

228
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,608
But tomorrow. . .

229
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:10,332
. . .you run in uniform. . .

230
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:11,483
. . .full packs. . .

231
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:13,566
...20 miles!

232
00:22:14,253 --> 00:22:15,527
Everybody makes it...

233
00:22:15,773 --> 00:22:16,922
...or nobody eats...

234
00:22:17,173 --> 00:22:19,243
...for the third day in a roW!

235
00:23:13,413 --> 00:23:14,812
Everybody up.

236
00:23:15,053 --> 00:23:16,850
You got meat tonight.

237
00:23:23,973 --> 00:23:26,931
Why don't you tell Shakespeare
what kind it is?

238
00:23:29,813 --> 00:23:31,041
Mule.

239
00:23:34,053 --> 00:23:34,929
God-awful animal.

240
00:23:36,653 --> 00:23:39,167
Sterile offspring of horse and donkey.

241
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:41,807
Can you imagine that?

242
00:23:42,573 --> 00:23:45,690
There's no room in the New World
for a bastard like that.

243
00:23:57,413 --> 00:24:00,689
Any man last in line
ain't hungry enough to eat.

244
00:24:09,693 --> 00:24:11,411
You show up last. . .

245
00:24:12,093 --> 00:24:13,128
. . .you don't eat!

246
00:24:20,853 --> 00:24:24,402
l'm going to die
before l'm last in line again!

247
00:24:24,653 --> 00:24:26,689
That's what they're hoping for.

248
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:31,286
Shut up! At least you're eating!

249
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:37,966
You serious?

250
00:24:47,813 --> 00:24:49,007
Good.

251
00:24:50,453 --> 00:24:52,250
This is good!

252
00:25:24,373 --> 00:25:25,806
You want this?!

253
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:29,331
This is what you want?

254
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:41,729
Babies!

255
00:25:48,053 --> 00:25:50,328
The hills are alive

256
00:25:50,893 --> 00:25:53,168
With the sound of music

257
00:26:00,453 --> 00:26:03,525
These were supposed to be
the best years of my life.

258
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:14,766
The Laws of Eight, gentlemen.

259
00:26:15,013 --> 00:26:18,642
That is the legacy
handed down to us by Nathan Holn.

260
00:26:18,893 --> 00:26:19,848
May he burn in hell.

261
00:26:20,253 --> 00:26:22,528
These are the laws that we live by.

262
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:24,043
The 8. . .

263
00:26:24,493 --> 00:26:25,687
. . .is our symbol.

264
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,648
Each man will bear it with pride.

265
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:33,648
Only then will you be part of the clan.

266
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,565
Sit down, gentlemen.

267
00:26:53,453 --> 00:26:55,045
Law One:

268
00:26:55,293 --> 00:26:58,729
You will obey orders without question.
l told you to sit.

269
00:27:01,693 --> 00:27:03,126
There weren't enough chairs.

270
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:06,490
l didn't specify chairs.
You could've sat on the ground.

271
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:10,327
You disobeyed a direct order.
You broke. . .

272
00:27:10,573 --> 00:27:11,688
. . .Law One.

273
00:27:12,053 --> 00:27:13,327
Law Two:

274
00:27:13,573 --> 00:27:15,450
Ounishment shall be swift.

275
00:27:18,293 --> 00:27:19,646
Law Three:

276
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:21,887
Mercy. . .

277
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:23,885
. . .is for the weak.

278
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:28,002
Four:

279
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:30,287
Terror. . .

280
00:27:31,973 --> 00:27:33,804
. . .will defeat reason.

281
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,449
Five:

282
00:27:36,453 --> 00:27:38,648
Your allegiance is to the clan.

283
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:41,288
Six:

284
00:27:42,253 --> 00:27:44,448
Justice can be dictated.

285
00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:47,292
Seven:

286
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:51,809
Any clansmen may challenge
for leadership of the clan.

287
00:27:52,613 --> 00:27:54,251
Does anyone
wish to challenge me?

288
00:27:57,533 --> 00:27:58,329
On your feet.

289
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:02,611
Law Eight:

290
00:28:05,653 --> 00:28:08,406
There's only one penalty.
Death.

291
00:28:08,613 --> 00:28:10,092
Olease!
l'm begging you!

292
00:28:29,253 --> 00:28:31,926
You will get out of this army
what you put into it.

293
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:34,689
Work and you'll be fed.

294
00:28:35,573 --> 00:28:37,291
Fight and you'll be respected.

295
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:41,008
Die and you'll be remembered.

296
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,122
You thinking of challenging
for leadership?

297
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:55,843
No, sir.

298
00:28:56,093 --> 00:28:57,651
l'm a follower. . .

299
00:28:57,973 --> 00:28:59,372
. . .not a leader.

300
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,012
You got a smart mouth. . .

301
00:29:01,253 --> 00:29:02,447
. . .Shakespeare.

302
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:05,682
You see Colonel Getty
always following the General?

303
00:29:06,293 --> 00:29:08,648
He was the last man ever to challenge.

304
00:29:08,893 --> 00:29:10,485
Fight lasted 6 seconds. . .

305
00:29:11,893 --> 00:29:13,724
. . .but he didn't kill him.

306
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,732
Cut off his tongue. . .

307
00:29:16,413 --> 00:29:18,210
. . .then he cut off his balls.

308
00:29:18,893 --> 00:29:22,886
And old Getty's been following him
around like a dog ever since.

309
00:29:24,213 --> 00:29:25,123
Fall out!

310
00:29:29,253 --> 00:29:30,971
The General don't see it. . .

311
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,447
. . .but l say
you've got some nigger in you.

312
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:55,321
They're yours?

313
00:29:59,893 --> 00:30:01,770
A solitary man, aren't you?

314
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:06,169
Binoculars to watch life from a distance
and Shakespeare. . .

315
00:30:06,853 --> 00:30:09,572
. . .to read about it,
instead of living it.

316
00:30:10,013 --> 00:30:12,243
No offense, but you seem
to have read Shakespeare. . .

317
00:30:12,493 --> 00:30:13,528
. . .yourself.

318
00:30:16,493 --> 00:30:18,688
lf he wishes to rise
above mere thuggery. . .

319
00:30:18,933 --> 00:30:22,005
. . .a military commander
must be classically educated. . .

320
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:25,370
. . .philosophy and history,
even a sense of the dramatic.

321
00:30:28,853 --> 00:30:31,367
What do you think that l did
before the war?

322
00:30:32,173 --> 00:30:33,891
Do you think
that l was in the army?

323
00:30:34,893 --> 00:30:36,611
l sold copying machines.

324
00:30:37,013 --> 00:30:38,366
l was a salesman. . .

325
00:30:39,773 --> 00:30:43,083
. . .with the talent to lead men,
devise and execute a battle plan. . .

326
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,766
. . .locked away inside.

327
00:30:45,013 --> 00:30:49,086
lf Nathan Holn hadn't come along,
l'd still be selling copying machines.

328
00:30:50,493 --> 00:30:51,448
Can you imagine. . .

329
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:55,083
. . .the wasted life?
Can you imagine the magnitude of that?

330
00:30:56,173 --> 00:30:57,367
But war. . .

331
00:30:58,173 --> 00:31:00,528
. . .war gives men like me a chance.

332
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:02,042
Here.

333
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,328
"The prize is often left unclaimed.

334
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:14,087
We must have the courage to grasp it. . .

335
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,847
. . .for fortune always favors the bold. "

336
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,805
He always inspires me.

337
00:31:34,573 --> 00:31:37,133
l have a design for the future.
A master plan.

338
00:31:37,973 --> 00:31:41,010
l will need able officers
to help me carry it out.

339
00:31:42,573 --> 00:31:44,052
You have the intelligence.

340
00:31:44,453 --> 00:31:45,932
lf your heart matches. . .

341
00:31:46,173 --> 00:31:47,606
. . .you will go far.

342
00:31:47,853 --> 00:31:49,366
We'll talk more in weeks to come.

343
00:31:49,653 --> 00:31:50,881
Dismissed.

344
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:52,248
Captain!

345
00:31:52,653 --> 00:31:54,450
We'll be moving out tomorrow.

346
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:56,411
lssue those binoculars to a scout.

347
00:31:57,733 --> 00:31:59,086
And the book, sir?

348
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:00,488
Burn it.

349
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,526
Quit moving!

350
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:14,927
What happened?

351
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,088
-What happened? What'd he say?
-Nothing.

352
00:32:19,893 --> 00:32:21,326
Did he say anything about me?

353
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:22,642
No!

354
00:32:27,573 --> 00:32:30,645
-l'm getting out of here.
-What are you talking about?

355
00:32:32,653 --> 00:32:34,291
-Escaping.
-What?!

356
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:37,093
You ever hear of St. Rose?
lt's on the coast.

357
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:38,561
-lt's a paradise.
-We can't.

358
00:32:38,813 --> 00:32:39,723
We could!

359
00:32:39,973 --> 00:32:42,009
Between the 3 of us we could.

360
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:45,966
l can't.

361
00:32:47,373 --> 00:32:50,843
l like it here.

Some of the men shot a lion.

364
00:33:39,493 --> 00:33:41,006
They crawled into the thicket.

365
00:33:50,813 --> 00:33:52,610
One of you dogs earned a treat.

00:55:23,733 --> 00:55:28,363
. . .but what about the Holnists?
What'll the government do about them?

544
00:55:31,253 --> 00:55:34,086
The government's just getting started.

545
00:55:35,413 --> 00:55:38,962
So you're going to be on your own
for 6, 8 or 1 8 months.

546
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:43,249
How about the Marine Corps?

547
00:55:43,733 --> 00:55:44,483
Be quiet.

548
00:55:44,973 --> 00:55:46,042
Everyone be quiet.

549
00:55:47,933 --> 00:55:49,764
Can't we just let this man eat?

550
00:55:51,613 --> 00:55:52,807
Let us pray.

551
00:55:59,013 --> 00:56:01,129
We give you thanks for this food. . .

552
00:56:01,573 --> 00:56:02,688
. . .this day. . .

553
00:56:02,933 --> 00:56:04,651
. . .this man and his good news. . .

554
00:56:05,493 --> 00:56:07,529
. . .evidence of your promise. . .

555
00:56:07,773 --> 00:56:09,570
. . .that you will
hold our country together.

556
00:56:10,213 --> 00:56:11,043
Amen.

557
00:56:51,613 --> 00:56:53,365
Would you like to dance?

558
00:56:55,733 --> 00:56:57,564
l don't know if l can.

559
00:56:57,813 --> 00:56:59,610
l think l'm still on duty.

560
00:57:03,373 --> 00:57:05,489
All you have to do is hold on.

561
00:57:23,053 --> 00:57:24,805
lt's been a long time.

562
00:57:33,933 --> 00:57:35,412
Something wrong?

563
00:57:37,813 --> 00:57:39,246
How tall are you?

564
00:57:40,053 --> 00:57:41,566
About six feet.

565
00:57:41,813 --> 00:57:43,087
Are you smart?

566
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:48,405
Smarter than some, l guess.
Why?

567
00:57:48,973 --> 00:57:50,372
Just wondering.

568
00:58:01,293 --> 00:58:03,249
Have you ever had the bad mumps?

569
00:58:04,813 --> 00:58:06,451
Never had the bad mumps.

570
00:58:06,693 --> 00:58:08,968
No syphilis, nothing like that?

571
00:58:12,093 --> 00:58:14,482
So as far as you know. . .

572
00:58:15,253 --> 00:58:17,084
. . .you have good semen?

573
00:58:20,973 --> 00:58:22,929
ls that a trick question?

574
00:58:23,413 --> 00:58:24,971
No, it's not.

575
00:58:28,053 --> 00:58:29,042
l'm only asking. . .

576
00:58:29,613 --> 00:58:32,081
. . .because l want you
to make me pregnant.

577
00:58:34,573 --> 00:58:35,562
All right. . .

578
00:58:36,093 --> 00:58:37,208
. . .that's it.

579
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:38,882
Wait.

580
00:58:39,133 --> 00:58:40,407
Wait, please.

581
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:45,283
lt's got to be the uniform.

582
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:49,045
This is my husband, Michael.
He hasn't said no.

583
00:58:50,733 --> 00:58:52,291
l haven't said anything yet.

584
00:58:52,533 --> 00:58:55,127
We've been trying
to have a baby for 3 years.

585
00:58:55,373 --> 00:58:58,570
We cannot on account of Michael.
He had the bad mumps when he was 1 2.

586
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:01,648
So we need a body father.

587
00:59:02,973 --> 00:59:05,441
We could ask a man here,
but it may cause problems.

588
00:59:05,693 --> 00:59:07,206
We've seen it happen.

589
00:59:07,453 --> 00:59:11,924
Things go okay until the woman shows,
then it can be difficult.

590
00:59:12,213 --> 00:59:15,205
But you'll only be around
once in a while with the mail.

591
00:59:17,973 --> 00:59:19,691
You're the postman.

592
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:21,732
What do you say, mister?

593
00:59:23,053 --> 00:59:24,088
You'd do us a favor.

594
00:59:28,093 --> 00:59:29,651
l'm going to think about it.

595
00:59:38,013 --> 00:59:39,366
Excuse me.

596
00:59:41,213 --> 00:59:44,125
My mother
would like to give you something.

597
00:59:46,013 --> 00:59:47,412
He's right here, Mom.

598
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:51,805
lt's to my other daughter. . .

599
00:59:52,053 --> 00:59:53,327
. . .Annie.

600
01:00:03,453 --> 01:00:04,442
lt doesn't say where.

601
01:00:05,493 --> 01:00:09,281
We don't know where she is.
She left 5 years ago.

602
01:00:09,533 --> 01:00:11,649
The last we heard
she was living up north.

603
01:00:13,933 --> 01:00:16,003
Look, Mrs. March,
you should know that--

604
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:17,409
Know what?

605
01:00:24,973 --> 01:00:27,282
l have a feeling about you.

606
01:00:28,013 --> 01:00:30,402
l know you'll do what's right.

607
01:00:48,693 --> 01:00:49,842
l got to get out of here.

608
01:01:04,493 --> 01:01:05,608
Easy, boy.

609
01:01:05,853 --> 01:01:07,445
lt's right around the corner.

610
01:01:12,573 --> 01:01:13,244
What is?

611
01:01:13,893 --> 01:01:14,962
What you're looking for.

612
01:01:25,613 --> 01:01:27,524
What l'm looking for?

613
01:01:31,533 --> 01:01:33,205
Crazy old coot.

614
01:02:13,853 --> 01:02:15,366
l knew you'd come here.

615
01:02:18,133 --> 01:02:18,929
You did?

616
01:02:23,413 --> 01:02:25,881
So how do you
get to be a postman, anyhow?

617
01:02:27,093 --> 01:02:30,768
You have to be in the right place
at the right time.

618
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:31,684
How can l do it?

619
01:02:35,093 --> 01:02:39,086
-l thought you wanted to drive cars.
-Not anymore. That's kid's stuff.

620
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:40,607
This is real.

621
01:02:41,253 --> 01:02:42,845
So where's the right place?

622
01:02:45,173 --> 01:02:47,892
Could be anywhere, you know.
Anytime.

623
01:02:48,813 --> 01:02:51,805
Only another postman
can make you a postman.

624
01:02:52,093 --> 01:02:54,004
Kind of like vampires, right?

625
01:02:56,733 --> 01:02:58,371
Yeah, something like that.

626
01:03:00,293 --> 01:03:01,726
You have to be sworn in,
so. . . .

627
01:03:07,733 --> 01:03:11,362
The organization's kind of shaky
right now. lt might not last.

628
01:03:11,613 --> 01:03:12,841
What does?

629
01:03:15,413 --> 01:03:17,244
You'd meet people
who don't believe in you.

630
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:19,085
l'll set them straight.

631
01:03:20,893 --> 01:03:22,531
lt's a lonely job.

632
01:03:23,653 --> 01:03:25,769
l've been lonely all my life.

633
01:03:27,653 --> 01:03:29,086
So have l, Ford.

634
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,372
So have l.

635
01:03:33,173 --> 01:03:34,288
What the hell!

636
01:03:35,093 --> 01:03:36,492
You repeat after me.

637
01:03:40,413 --> 01:03:41,846
"Neither snow. . .

638
01:03:42,093 --> 01:03:43,321
. . .nor rain. . .

639
01:03:43,613 --> 01:03:44,841
. . .nor heat. . .

640
01:03:45,373 --> 01:03:46,442
. . .nor gloom of night. . .

641
01:03:51,293 --> 01:03:52,851
. . .stays these couriers. . .

642
01:03:53,653 --> 01:03:57,248
. . .from the swift completion
of their appointed rounds. "

643
01:03:59,253 --> 01:03:59,810
Okay, then.

644
01:04:00,053 --> 01:04:00,690
Okay, then.

645
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:05,050
No, l'm saying that.
You just listen.

646
01:04:05,293 --> 01:04:06,487
l'm sorry.

647
01:04:08,413 --> 01:04:11,371
By my authority you're now empowered
to carry the mail.

648
01:04:12,453 --> 01:04:13,681
Congratulations.

649
01:04:14,853 --> 01:04:16,650
You're a postman.

650
01:04:22,493 --> 01:04:24,404
l'd die to get a letter through.

651
01:04:26,253 --> 01:04:27,481
What did you say?

652
01:04:28,493 --> 01:04:31,451
-l said l'd die to get a letter through.
-Johnny!

653
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:33,532
Why don't you run along.

654
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:36,289
l need to speak to this man.

655
01:04:37,693 --> 01:04:39,285
l'll see you around.

656
01:04:40,053 --> 01:04:41,725
Sure thing, Ford.

657
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:48,201
Johnny is impressed with you.
Whole town is impressed with you.

658
01:04:48,453 --> 01:04:50,091
l take it you're not.

659
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:53,530
-You're smarter than you look.
-What can l do for you?

660
01:04:53,773 --> 01:04:58,051
You can either clear out or l can
throw you out. Either way suits me.

661
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:02,004
You don't understand. l'm
a government employee authorized by--

662
01:05:02,253 --> 01:05:04,687
You are not authorized by shit!

663
01:05:04,973 --> 01:05:07,533
You were trying to sneak out of here.
You are nothing. . .

664
01:05:07,773 --> 01:05:11,812
. . .but a drifter who found
a bag of mail. l want you out of town.

665
01:05:12,853 --> 01:05:15,890
All right. This is going in my report.

666
01:05:16,653 --> 01:05:19,008
These people don't need dreams,
Mr. Oostman.

667
01:05:19,253 --> 01:05:22,723
They need something real.
They need help with the Holnists.

668
01:05:22,973 --> 01:05:24,884
Are you going to bring them that?

669
01:05:27,093 --> 01:05:28,492
Didn't think so.

670
01:05:30,053 --> 01:05:34,126
All you cost us so far is a few bowls
of soup and maybe a few broken hearts.

671
01:05:34,373 --> 01:05:36,329
l aim to keep it that way.

672
01:05:36,853 --> 01:05:38,684
You can stay here till morning. . .

673
01:05:38,933 --> 01:05:41,731
. . .then l don't ever want
to see you again.

674
01:06:02,453 --> 01:06:03,249
"Benning.

675
01:06:05,853 --> 01:06:07,445
Oortland.

676
01:06:10,293 --> 01:06:11,521
Boston"?

677
01:06:11,773 --> 01:06:14,082
What the hell these people--

678
01:06:14,373 --> 01:06:15,931
Just leave it.

679
01:06:19,853 --> 01:06:21,764
l said, leave it.

680
01:06:28,133 --> 01:06:29,532
"St. Rose"?

681
01:06:54,013 --> 01:06:54,843
Hello, Abby.

682
01:06:57,773 --> 01:06:59,252
You'll be leaving tomorrow?

683
01:07:01,373 --> 01:07:02,567
l guess.

684
01:07:07,533 --> 01:07:10,730
Everybody's up late writing letters
for you to take.

685
01:07:11,893 --> 01:07:13,611
They're so excited.

686
01:07:14,893 --> 01:07:17,248
And how about you?
Do you have a letter?

687
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:21,723
l don't have anybody to write to.

688
01:07:22,493 --> 01:07:24,051
l'll find you a pen pal.

689
01:07:24,973 --> 01:07:27,168
Someone with similar interests.
You know?

690
01:07:27,413 --> 01:07:29,005
Like dancing and. . .

691
01:07:30,293 --> 01:07:31,521
. . .checking for mumps.

692
01:07:32,613 --> 01:07:33,443
You're funny.

693
01:07:34,893 --> 01:07:36,690
Hardly anybody's funny around here.

694
01:07:43,413 --> 01:07:45,324
Have you decided yet?

695
01:07:57,293 --> 01:07:58,965
Been thinking about it.

696
01:08:21,053 --> 01:08:22,327
Sure.

697
01:08:23,213 --> 01:08:24,123
l mean. . .

698
01:08:25,453 --> 01:08:26,727
. . .why not?

699
01:08:34,093 --> 01:08:35,492
God, you're so. . . .

700
01:08:36,373 --> 01:08:37,522
You're so. . .

701
01:08:38,453 --> 01:08:39,602
. . .beautiful.

702
01:08:41,733 --> 01:08:45,442
l'm sorry, you probably want
to keep things more clinical.

703
01:08:46,733 --> 01:08:48,883
You don't even know my name.

704
01:08:50,653 --> 01:08:52,405
l don't want to.

705
01:08:58,773 --> 01:09:00,331
lt would be easier for me. . .

706
01:09:00,573 --> 01:09:02,564
. . .if you closed your eyes.

707
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:24,371
We took a vote, Mr. Oostman.

708
01:11:24,893 --> 01:11:26,292
We want you to have this.

709
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:34,607
So you can't say no.

710
01:11:40,373 --> 01:11:41,806
l'll take it.

711
01:11:44,493 --> 01:11:47,246
You got a bedroll, some oats
and a week's rations.

712
01:11:47,573 --> 01:11:48,608
Good.

713
01:11:49,213 --> 01:11:50,202
Thank you.

714
01:11:50,453 --> 01:11:52,364
Where will you go from here?

715
01:11:53,133 --> 01:11:54,202
Go?

716
01:12:00,133 --> 01:12:00,963
West. . .

717
01:12:03,613 --> 01:12:05,092
. . .then l'll work my way. . .

718
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:07,528
. . .back here,
sort of a figure eight.

719
01:12:14,573 --> 01:12:16,529
Times seem hard right now.

720
01:12:16,813 --> 01:12:18,963
But you got to believe
things are getting better.

721
01:12:22,013 --> 01:12:23,810
Birds are migrating again.

722
01:12:24,093 --> 01:12:25,526
The rains are back.

723
01:12:27,293 --> 01:12:28,282
Stuff's. . . .

724
01:12:28,613 --> 01:12:30,171
Stuff's getting better.

725
01:12:32,613 --> 01:12:34,205
O beautiful

726
01:12:36,413 --> 01:12:39,849
For spacious skies

727
01:12:40,093 --> 01:12:43,085
For amber Waves of grain

728
01:12:47,453 --> 01:12:48,681
Shit!

729
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:51,291
You've got a hell of a nerve,
whoever you are.

730
01:12:58,373 --> 01:13:00,443
Did you see Abby around this morning?

731
01:13:02,933 --> 01:13:04,571
This is as far as l go.

732
01:13:05,133 --> 01:13:06,327
You're on your own.

733
01:13:06,493 --> 01:13:09,291
God shed his grace on thee

734
01:13:13,133 --> 01:13:15,089
And croWn thy good

735
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:17,369
With brotherhood

736
01:13:18,173 --> 01:13:20,368
Are you really
who you say you are?

737
01:13:20,853 --> 01:13:23,242
lf l come back with some mail. . .

738
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:24,886
. . .you'll know.

739
01:13:31,493 --> 01:13:32,812
Goddamn it!

740
01:14:02,013 --> 01:14:04,004
What are you looking at?

741
01:14:05,133 --> 01:14:06,566
Everything.

742
01:15:04,893 --> 01:15:06,770
They don't usually look at me.

743
01:15:22,293 --> 01:15:24,761
Who is responsible. . .

744
01:15:25,133 --> 01:15:26,452
. . .for that?

745
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:31,967
l said. . .

746
01:15:32,213 --> 01:15:34,568
. . . "Who's responsible. . .

747
01:15:34,813 --> 01:15:35,802
. . .for that?! "

748
01:15:41,493 --> 01:15:43,927
Holnists, Johnny.
You got to stay--

749
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:48,767
-You got to stay out of sight.
-l'm a postman!

750
01:15:49,013 --> 01:15:50,890
And l'm not running from anybody!

751
01:15:51,133 --> 01:15:54,011
Stay out of this,
or l will lock you up myself.

752
01:16:04,653 --> 01:16:05,722
You'll be responsible.

753
01:16:14,293 --> 01:16:16,443
Now set that flag on fire.

754
01:16:42,373 --> 01:16:44,807
Throw it through the window
of your post office.

755
01:16:45,773 --> 01:16:47,491
Do it, Michael.

756
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:49,769
lt's all right, Michael.
Throw it.

757
01:16:54,773 --> 01:16:56,331
The United States. . .

758
01:16:56,573 --> 01:16:58,529
. . .doesn't exist!

759
01:17:01,133 --> 01:17:03,363
That flag is an abomination!

760
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:28,971
There was the strangest little goat
and it was behind a fence and it. . . .

761
01:17:39,253 --> 01:17:42,131
l looked at it and it had a color to it.

762
01:17:47,213 --> 01:17:48,362
Good.

763
01:17:48,653 --> 01:17:49,847
Everything.

764
01:17:51,773 --> 01:17:54,128
l was amazed.
lt was. . . .

765
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:56,481
Good Lord!

766
01:17:58,213 --> 01:17:59,362
That, gentlemen. . .

767
01:18:00,413 --> 01:18:02,643
. . .is a first-rate piece of ass.

768
01:18:05,333 --> 01:18:09,485
Tell the sheriff to introduce me.
She doesn't belong in this mudhole.

769
01:18:09,733 --> 01:18:10,848
Excuse me.

770
01:18:12,373 --> 01:18:13,567
You again!

771
01:18:14,533 --> 01:18:16,046
That's my wife, General.

772
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:17,921
She's a married woman.

773
01:18:18,413 --> 01:18:19,482
Really?

774
01:18:22,293 --> 01:18:24,887
Do you know what system of government
we have here?

775
01:18:26,733 --> 01:18:30,521
We have what is known as a feudal
system, like in the Middle Ages.

776
01:18:30,773 --> 01:18:33,492
That's lords and vassals.
That's you and me.

777
01:18:34,533 --> 01:18:35,807
Now those lords. . .

778
01:18:36,053 --> 01:18:37,452
. . .they had some ideas.

779
01:18:37,693 --> 01:18:40,605
They believed that
if a vassal got married. . .

780
01:18:40,853 --> 01:18:42,809
. . .it was the lord's right. . .

781
01:18:43,053 --> 01:18:44,247
. . .his right. . .

782
01:18:44,813 --> 01:18:47,407
. . .to sleep with the bride
on the wedding night.

783
01:18:53,693 --> 01:18:55,206
Me and Abby
have been married 3 years.

784
01:18:56,413 --> 01:18:59,052
l'm sorry, but l wasn't invited
to the wedding.

785
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:07,523
You've already done me one favor, son.

786
01:19:08,373 --> 01:19:10,967
Don't let this be a black mark
on an otherwise perfect record.

787
01:19:19,813 --> 01:19:22,202
We'll be civilized about this.

788
01:19:22,453 --> 01:19:25,331
l want you to give me your blessing.

789
01:19:33,373 --> 01:19:34,806
Sir, l can't.

790
01:19:36,133 --> 01:19:37,327
You can't?

791
01:19:39,533 --> 01:19:40,522
You can't.

792
01:19:42,453 --> 01:19:43,852
"Can't. "

793
01:19:48,613 --> 01:19:51,207
We had a great nation once.

794
01:19:52,973 --> 01:19:54,201
Know what made it great?

795
01:19:55,933 --> 01:19:57,207
"l can. "

796
01:19:58,293 --> 01:19:59,521
Till the weak came along.

797
01:20:00,973 --> 01:20:03,089
The "l can'ts" destroyed us!

798
01:20:05,093 --> 01:20:06,924
l'm going to make us strong again.

799
01:20:07,333 --> 01:20:09,244
l'm going to be the father. . .

800
01:20:09,533 --> 01:20:10,932
. . .of a new nation.

801
01:20:11,893 --> 01:20:13,292
And do you know why. . .

802
01:20:13,533 --> 01:20:15,046
. . .it will be me?

803
01:20:19,373 --> 01:20:21,045
Because l can.

804
01:20:30,533 --> 01:20:31,761
Stop it!

805
01:20:36,053 --> 01:20:37,372
You're killing him!

806
01:20:38,013 --> 01:20:38,889
Let me go!

807
01:20:41,173 --> 01:20:42,492
Olease, let me go!

808
01:20:49,973 --> 01:20:51,884
Help him, somebody!
Olease!

809
01:21:00,173 --> 01:21:01,731
You didn't have to--!

810
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:03,812
Didn't have to what?

811
01:21:06,813 --> 01:21:08,212
You bastard!

812
01:21:09,933 --> 01:21:11,332
You killed him!

813
01:21:12,053 --> 01:21:14,123
Your people seem seditious.

814
01:21:15,533 --> 01:21:17,489
You seem seditious.

815
01:21:18,733 --> 01:21:20,928
What am l seeing here?

816
01:21:21,373 --> 01:21:22,123
l'm waiting!

817
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:35,121
A man came through with mail.
Said he was a postman.

818
01:21:35,373 --> 01:21:37,933
Said that the government
had been restored back east.

819
01:21:38,173 --> 01:21:39,925
What government?

820
01:21:40,493 --> 01:21:43,405
The United States government!

821
01:21:45,253 --> 01:21:46,288
Who said that?

822
01:22:03,653 --> 01:22:05,769
Which way did he go?

823
01:22:06,653 --> 01:22:08,291
Do not make me ask again.

824
01:22:08,533 --> 01:22:09,329
East.

825
01:22:10,413 --> 01:22:12,244
Send a patrol east!

826
01:22:12,893 --> 01:22:13,928
Send 3 more. . .

827
01:22:14,533 --> 01:22:15,966
. . .north, south and west!

828
01:22:17,453 --> 01:22:19,171
They'd better find him east.

829
01:22:38,533 --> 01:22:40,728
Take that damn shirt off, Johnny!

830
01:22:44,013 --> 01:22:45,685
l managed to save these.

831
01:22:45,933 --> 01:22:47,730
Do you want to die too?

832
01:22:49,533 --> 01:22:52,093
l'm headed south with the mail.

833
01:22:54,973 --> 01:22:56,531
Don't be a fool.

834
01:22:57,213 --> 01:22:58,646
What should l be?

835
01:23:10,413 --> 01:23:11,687
Rachel Clark.

836
01:23:15,053 --> 01:23:17,283
"Charlie Sykes. "

837
01:23:23,933 --> 01:23:25,366
"Graham Drewitt. "

838
01:23:26,013 --> 01:23:28,652
G.D. died of flu last winter.

839
01:23:31,133 --> 01:23:32,805
That's all there is.

840
01:23:34,493 --> 01:23:35,721
That's all there is, folks.

841
01:23:36,293 --> 01:23:37,009
For now.

842
01:23:38,333 --> 01:23:42,804
But there'll be more, lots more,
once there's a real system in place.

843
01:23:44,093 --> 01:23:45,048
Right?

844
01:23:48,853 --> 01:23:49,888
What about New York City?

845
01:23:51,533 --> 01:23:52,807
Did they survive the plague?

846
01:23:55,733 --> 01:23:56,882
Survive?

847
01:23:59,733 --> 01:24:01,963
They got Broadway up and running again.

848
01:24:05,613 --> 01:24:08,446
There's a kid doing Andrew Floyd Webber,
you wouldn't believe.

849
01:24:08,693 --> 01:24:10,285
How much is it to mail a letter?

850
01:24:11,293 --> 01:24:12,408
"Mail. . . . "

851
01:24:39,413 --> 01:24:40,687
They won't open the gates.

852
01:24:43,053 --> 01:24:46,887
They say they got a representative
of the Restored United States in there.

853
01:24:47,773 --> 01:24:49,126
They say this army is illegal.

854
01:24:49,893 --> 01:24:51,531
-And they say--
-Drop dead!

855
01:24:51,773 --> 01:24:53,729
And go to hell!

856
01:24:55,933 --> 01:24:57,161
That's what they say.

857
01:24:57,413 --> 01:24:59,324
What are you doing?!
Open the gates.

858
01:25:03,733 --> 01:25:04,768
ldiots!

859
01:25:08,253 --> 01:25:09,402
What're you thinking?!

860
01:25:11,493 --> 01:25:12,369
The Romans. . .

861
01:25:12,973 --> 01:25:14,201
. . .had an expression. . .

862
01:25:14,453 --> 01:25:17,126
. . .they used to scare their children.

863
01:25:18,533 --> 01:25:19,807
"Hannibal...

864
01:25:20,493 --> 01:25:22,449
...ad portas!"

865
01:25:23,773 --> 01:25:25,092
Hannibal. . .

866
01:25:25,933 --> 01:25:27,844
. . .is at the gates.

867
01:25:34,733 --> 01:25:36,485
Do you know who Hannibal was?

868
01:25:38,413 --> 01:25:39,528
Of course not.

869
01:25:39,773 --> 01:25:42,571
A pretty girl like you
wouldn't understand something like that.

870
01:25:47,773 --> 01:25:49,286
-Let's fight them!
-With what?

871
01:25:49,533 --> 01:25:52,605
We've got 5 guns,
maybe 20 rounds of ammo.

872
01:25:52,853 --> 01:25:54,525
How we going to fight with that?

873
01:25:54,773 --> 01:25:55,842
You don't.

874
01:25:59,253 --> 01:26:01,005
Negotiate a settlement.

875
01:26:01,653 --> 01:26:02,881
Give them extra supplies.

876
01:26:08,853 --> 01:26:10,844
You're the government rep.
Tell them.

877
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:26,282
Right here.

878
01:26:36,573 --> 01:26:39,246
Make it quick.
l've got an attack to coordinate.

879
01:26:40,373 --> 01:26:42,568
They've asked me
to negotiate a peace treaty.

880
01:26:46,373 --> 01:26:47,123
Do l know you?

881
01:26:48,613 --> 01:26:50,092
l don't think so, sir.

882
01:26:50,813 --> 01:26:52,405
You're the postman.

883
01:26:52,853 --> 01:26:53,683
Aren't you?

884
01:26:57,133 --> 01:26:58,168
lnside!

885
01:27:02,493 --> 01:27:04,085
"U.S. Mail. "

886
01:27:05,173 --> 01:27:07,926
"The Restored United States of America. "

887
01:27:08,613 --> 01:27:11,411
Do these people
really believe that shit?!

888
01:27:12,733 --> 01:27:14,689
Who are you, really?

889
01:27:15,293 --> 01:27:17,329
l'm a United States postman. . .

890
01:27:17,653 --> 01:27:21,043
. . .authorized by Order 41 7
of the Restored Congress.

891
01:27:21,293 --> 01:27:25,172
l was at the Battle of Georgetown.
l watched the White House burn down.

892
01:27:25,413 --> 01:27:27,369
Do not try to sell me. . .

893
01:27:27,613 --> 01:27:29,843
. . .on any Restored United States!

894
01:27:32,533 --> 01:27:35,127
The new capital is based
in Minneapolis. . .

895
01:27:35,493 --> 01:27:37,882
. . .inside the Hubert Humphrey Metrodome.

896
01:27:38,453 --> 01:27:40,887
You know where the Vikings
used to play?

897
01:27:42,973 --> 01:27:44,326
You're funny.

898
01:27:49,653 --> 01:27:51,325
What are the terms?

899
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:54,927
They'll open the gates,
give double the usual. . .

900
01:27:55,453 --> 01:27:56,249
. . .just. . .

901
01:27:56,493 --> 01:27:57,687
. . .don't hurt anybody.

902
01:27:57,973 --> 01:27:59,565
This was all a misunderstanding.

903
01:28:07,093 --> 01:28:09,129
l appreciate your offer, Mr. Oostman.

904
01:28:09,373 --> 01:28:12,843
But the fact is that you're
in no position to negotiate.

905
01:28:13,333 --> 01:28:16,689
These people made it through the bugs
and the riots. . .

906
01:28:17,413 --> 01:28:20,564
. . .and the 3-year winters,
but they're not going to survive you.

907
01:28:21,933 --> 01:28:22,809
Fire at will!

908
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:34,252
Law Six:

909
01:28:34,453 --> 01:28:36,364
Justice can be. . .

910
01:28:36,613 --> 01:28:37,762
. . .dictated!

911
01:28:40,973 --> 01:28:44,488
Kill him, and kill
the Restored United States with him.

912
01:29:06,413 --> 01:29:07,528
ln accordance with Law 8. . .

913
01:29:07,773 --> 01:29:10,241
. . .and by the authority
of Emergency Order 46. . .

914
01:29:10,493 --> 01:29:11,846
. . .you are hereby--

915
01:29:18,933 --> 01:29:19,809
Get her!

916
01:30:11,853 --> 01:30:13,491
Go on, get him!

917
01:30:33,813 --> 01:30:35,769
We can't stop now.

918
01:30:38,293 --> 01:30:39,408
What are you. . .?

919
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:43,561
Oh, God!

920
01:31:07,834 --> 01:31:09,062
Come on down.

921
01:31:26,634 --> 01:31:27,828
Don't move.

922
01:31:34,714 --> 01:31:36,432
lf you had a bullet,
you'd use it.

923
01:32:49,034 --> 01:32:50,149
Come on.

924
01:33:40,074 --> 01:33:43,146
l don't think
l ever had water soup before.

925
01:33:43,954 --> 01:33:47,185
Maybe next time
we could try it with a little sand.

926
01:33:48,674 --> 01:33:49,868
Dirt.

927
01:33:51,914 --> 01:33:53,188
Maybe a twig garnish.

928
01:33:58,994 --> 01:34:00,905
You used to think l was funny.

929
01:34:04,754 --> 01:34:06,392
They killed Michael.

930
01:34:15,514 --> 01:34:16,424
l'm sorry.

931
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:21,703
How sorry are you?

932
01:34:23,154 --> 01:34:24,109
What?

933
01:34:28,994 --> 01:34:30,985
What's that supposed to mean?

934
01:34:33,874 --> 01:34:34,624
What's with you?

935
01:34:34,874 --> 01:34:36,865
You have the mark of 8 on you.

936
01:34:38,674 --> 01:34:39,584
Mark doesn't mean--

937
01:34:39,834 --> 01:34:41,426
You're a liar.

938
01:34:44,354 --> 01:34:45,423
You were with Bethlehem.

939
01:34:46,394 --> 01:34:48,430
Does that make you one of them?

940
01:34:59,834 --> 01:35:01,870
Don't make me use this.

941
01:35:16,314 --> 01:35:17,793
Wind's come up.

942
01:35:18,114 --> 01:35:19,342
lt's getting colder too.

943
01:35:20,194 --> 01:35:22,549
Must be another storm.

944
01:35:26,034 --> 01:35:27,467
Anything else?

945
01:35:29,074 --> 01:35:30,905
l didn't mean for you to. . . .

946
01:35:31,154 --> 01:35:34,624
Your legs are going to rot off
if you don't try to walk.

947
01:35:34,954 --> 01:35:36,592
-l'm hurt.
-You're lazy!

948
01:35:36,834 --> 01:35:37,903
Lazy?

949
01:35:38,194 --> 01:35:40,310
l got a hole in my stomach. . .

950
01:35:40,554 --> 01:35:41,953
. . .and l'm weak.

951
01:35:42,194 --> 01:35:45,630
The 2 big meals around here
are snow and grass. . .

952
01:35:45,874 --> 01:35:47,785
. . .and we're running out of grass.

953
01:35:57,434 --> 01:35:58,662
What're you doing?

954
01:36:24,834 --> 01:36:25,983
Give me a break!

955
01:36:28,474 --> 01:36:29,668
l'm going to check the pass.

956
01:36:31,514 --> 01:36:33,027
Why are you in such a hurry?

957
01:36:33,274 --> 01:36:35,504
l could think of worse places.

958
01:36:36,434 --> 01:36:38,550
Or l could think of worse company.

959
01:36:45,594 --> 01:36:46,868
Oerfect!

960
01:37:42,674 --> 01:37:43,663
Help!

961
01:37:51,034 --> 01:37:51,830
Help!

962
01:37:55,434 --> 01:37:56,423
Olease!

963
01:37:57,794 --> 01:37:58,749
Quick!

964
01:38:09,434 --> 01:38:10,947
God, help me!

965
01:38:29,994 --> 01:38:31,905
l told you that's all there was.

966
01:38:33,114 --> 01:38:35,105
That's why you should have it.

967
01:38:40,314 --> 01:38:42,032
l knew you could walk.

968
01:38:44,394 --> 01:38:45,588
You're weird.

969
01:38:46,474 --> 01:38:47,350
Know that?

970
01:39:09,994 --> 01:39:12,303
We walked on the moon once, Abby.

971
01:39:13,074 --> 01:39:14,473
So?

972
01:39:15,034 --> 01:39:16,911
What good is that now?

973
01:39:20,154 --> 01:39:21,951
Obviously you've forgotten. . .

974
01:39:22,194 --> 01:39:23,468
. . .Tang and. . .

975
01:39:24,154 --> 01:39:25,712
. . .microwave ovens and. . . .

976
01:39:31,914 --> 01:39:33,427
Your face looks pretty.

977
01:39:38,114 --> 01:39:39,388
l mean. . .

978
01:39:39,914 --> 01:39:41,870
. . .not so bruised.

979
01:39:48,754 --> 01:39:49,903
Look. . .

980
01:39:50,474 --> 01:39:51,987
. . .there's something
you'd better know.

981
01:39:53,714 --> 01:39:55,784
You're going to find out soon enough.

982
01:39:56,714 --> 01:39:57,942
l'm pregnant.

983
01:40:00,634 --> 01:40:02,545
lt's Michael's baby.

984
01:40:03,834 --> 01:40:05,904
You're just the body father.

985
01:40:11,154 --> 01:40:12,906
How do you know it's mine. . .

986
01:40:14,994 --> 01:40:16,313
. . .not Bethlehem's?

987
01:40:20,714 --> 01:40:23,308
He tried with me almost every night.

988
01:40:26,794 --> 01:40:28,432
He couldn't do it. . .

989
01:40:32,114 --> 01:40:33,706
. . .so he beat me.

990
01:40:37,634 --> 01:40:39,625
Said it was my fault.

991
01:40:45,714 --> 01:40:46,624
l'm sorry, Abby.

992
01:41:24,754 --> 01:41:26,028
What is it?

993
01:41:27,034 --> 01:41:28,513
What's wrong?

994
01:41:31,314 --> 01:41:32,303
ls it the baby?

995
01:41:33,434 --> 01:41:34,947
The pass is clear.

996
01:41:56,314 --> 01:41:57,713
What happened?

997
01:41:59,994 --> 01:42:01,905
Good, you got our stuff out.

998
01:42:02,154 --> 01:42:03,382
Of course.

999
01:42:04,314 --> 01:42:05,349
What?

1000
01:42:07,154 --> 01:42:08,587
l don't understand.

1001
01:42:09,674 --> 01:42:11,505
l set the fire.

1002
01:42:14,554 --> 01:42:16,590
Did you think we'd stay here forever?

1003
01:42:17,074 --> 01:42:18,189
No.

1004
01:42:21,154 --> 01:42:24,783
l'd appreciate it if you'd walk with me
to find someplace safe for the baby. . .

1005
01:42:25,034 --> 01:42:26,672
. . .then we can split up.

1006
01:42:26,914 --> 01:42:27,744
You shaved.

1007
01:42:29,794 --> 01:42:30,704
Looks nice.

1008
01:42:37,674 --> 01:42:39,187
You're really weird!

1009
01:42:39,434 --> 01:42:40,662
You know that?

1010
01:42:47,674 --> 01:42:49,710
You ever heard of St. Rose, Abby?

1011
01:42:50,314 --> 01:42:51,906
l've heard people talk.

1012
01:42:52,154 --> 01:42:54,190
l've heard lots of names. . .

1013
01:42:54,794 --> 01:42:57,433
. . .Bliss, Hesperia, and New Eden.

1014
01:42:57,754 --> 01:43:00,188
Sheriff Briscoe says it's a fantasy.

1015
01:43:00,434 --> 01:43:01,662
He's wrong.

1016
01:43:01,994 --> 01:43:03,791
St. Rose is out there. . .

1017
01:43:04,314 --> 01:43:05,429
. . .and l'm going to find it.

1018
01:43:05,674 --> 01:43:07,107
But you're The Oostman.

1019
01:43:07,354 --> 01:43:08,912
l'm nobody, Abby.

1020
01:43:23,354 --> 01:43:24,833
This is what l hate.

1021
01:43:25,074 --> 01:43:26,348
Strangers.

1022
01:43:26,594 --> 01:43:28,949
Do you say hi,
or do you blow their heads off?

1023
01:43:29,194 --> 01:43:31,754
Do they want to share what they got
or take what you have?

1024
01:43:33,114 --> 01:43:36,629
lf they want to take, how far
are you willing to go to stop them?

1025
01:43:37,714 --> 01:43:39,466
All right, that's far enough.

1026
01:43:40,594 --> 01:43:42,186
We don't want any trouble.

1027
01:43:45,074 --> 01:43:46,393
Me neither, mister.

1028
01:43:48,514 --> 01:43:49,310
What are you?

1029
01:43:49,554 --> 01:43:50,987
Carrier 1 8. . .

1030
01:43:51,514 --> 01:43:53,232
. . .U.S. Oostal Service.

1031
01:43:54,274 --> 01:43:55,070
Got any mail?

1032
01:43:55,474 --> 01:43:56,987
That's impossible.

1033
01:43:59,514 --> 01:44:01,106
Ain't you heard of The Oostman?

1034
01:44:02,714 --> 01:44:03,749
No.

1035
01:44:04,394 --> 01:44:05,668
Tell us.

1036
01:44:06,514 --> 01:44:08,982
He's only the greatest man
who ever lived.

1037
01:44:09,594 --> 01:44:11,346
He crossed the wasteland. . .

1038
01:44:11,594 --> 01:44:13,505
. . .shook his fist at the enemy. . .

1039
01:44:13,754 --> 01:44:17,110
. . .and spit in the eye
of General Bethlehem himself.

1040
01:44:17,834 --> 01:44:20,587
He's back east
with Oresident Starkey right now.

1041
01:44:21,474 --> 01:44:23,066
Who told you all this?

1042
01:44:23,634 --> 01:44:25,909
Oostmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury.

1043
01:44:26,194 --> 01:44:28,549
He's in direct contact
with the restored Congress.

1044
01:44:28,794 --> 01:44:30,466
Direct contact?!

1045
01:44:30,714 --> 01:44:31,863
l don't believe this!

1046
01:44:32,114 --> 01:44:33,433
Carrier camp!

1047
01:44:33,674 --> 01:44:34,993
Carrier camp!

1048
01:44:35,234 --> 01:44:36,633
Gather around, everybody!

1049
01:44:36,874 --> 01:44:39,388
Come on, gather around.
Got another letter here.

1050
01:44:40,714 --> 01:44:42,227
lt came in last night.

1051
01:44:45,474 --> 01:44:48,671
-What's all this?
-The Oostman sent Ford another letter.

1052
01:44:48,914 --> 01:44:50,506
He's going to read it.

1053
01:44:52,234 --> 01:44:53,872
"Hello, all postal carriers.

1054
01:44:58,554 --> 01:45:01,352
l'm here in Minneapolis
with Oresident Starkey. . .

1055
01:45:01,594 --> 01:45:03,425
. . .but my thoughts are with you.

1056
01:45:03,794 --> 01:45:04,670
Remember. . .

1057
01:45:04,914 --> 01:45:07,633
. . .nothing worth doing
can be done overnight.

1058
01:45:07,874 --> 01:45:11,503
Keep your chins up
and do your best not to get shot.

1059
01:45:11,754 --> 01:45:12,504
Signed. . .

1060
01:45:13,114 --> 01:45:14,069
. . .The Oostman" !

1061
01:45:17,714 --> 01:45:20,103
His letters are always kind of short.

1062
01:45:21,154 --> 01:45:22,553
Hold on!
There's a O.S.

1063
01:45:23,954 --> 01:45:26,593
Does anybody know
what O.S. stands for?

1064
01:45:42,594 --> 01:45:44,789
-Holy shit!
-That would be H.S., Eddie.

1065
01:45:45,834 --> 01:45:48,746
No, l saw him once
when l lived in Oineview.

1066
01:45:48,994 --> 01:45:50,222
lt's The Oostman.

1067
01:46:21,594 --> 01:46:23,471
Guess you want to talk about this.

1068
01:46:33,994 --> 01:46:35,791
l found him!

1069
01:46:41,634 --> 01:46:43,067
"Minneapolis"?

1070
01:46:43,594 --> 01:46:46,666
"O.S. Ford knows what to do"?

1071
01:46:47,914 --> 01:46:49,108
What is this?

1072
01:46:49,594 --> 01:46:51,585
What is all this?
What the hell--

1073
01:46:51,834 --> 01:46:52,983
l lied!

1074
01:46:53,234 --> 01:46:56,271
l told people you were
in direct contact with me.

1075
01:46:58,474 --> 01:47:01,671
-Why?
-Because l didn't want it to end.

1076
01:47:04,674 --> 01:47:05,709
Look. . .

1077
01:47:06,434 --> 01:47:09,870
. . .l don't know how long l can stay.
l mean. . .

1078
01:47:10,114 --> 01:47:11,593
. . .Oresident Starkey. . .

1079
01:47:11,834 --> 01:47:16,271
. . .he's going to send word for me
one day and then l'll have to move on.

1080
01:47:17,274 --> 01:47:18,832
Do you understand?

1081
01:47:25,674 --> 01:47:28,711
But you'll stay
until he sends word, right?

1082
01:47:39,434 --> 01:47:40,867
Don't do that.
Hands down.

1083
01:47:42,634 --> 01:47:45,353
You're staying till Oresident Starkey
sends word, right?

1084
01:47:45,834 --> 01:47:46,744
Yes!

1085
01:47:46,994 --> 01:47:48,791
Until he sends word. Right.

1086
01:47:49,994 --> 01:47:53,191
Could you say a few words
just so they know it's really you?

1087
01:47:58,714 --> 01:47:59,988
lt's me.

1088
01:48:17,834 --> 01:48:19,187
Coming down.

1089
01:48:22,754 --> 01:48:24,949
We bring all the mail here first.

1090
01:48:25,634 --> 01:48:26,828
We sort it.

1091
01:48:27,074 --> 01:48:29,224
We group it.
Then it goes out.

1092
01:48:29,834 --> 01:48:32,064
So far, we got 30 routes.

1093
01:48:42,434 --> 01:48:44,425
You spelled "tyranny" wrong.

1094
01:48:46,154 --> 01:48:47,382
Boy!

1095
01:48:47,914 --> 01:48:49,472
He's smart.

1096
01:48:50,554 --> 01:48:52,385
From the swift completion. . .

1097
01:48:53,474 --> 01:48:54,953
. . .of their appointed rounds.

1098
01:48:57,434 --> 01:49:00,631
Congratulations.
You are now U.S. postal carriers.

1099
01:49:12,954 --> 01:49:14,182
How old are you?

1100
01:49:14,874 --> 01:49:16,751
l'm 68, sir.

1101
01:49:19,994 --> 01:49:21,666
Can l ask you a question?

1102
01:49:24,634 --> 01:49:25,908
Can you ride?

1103
01:49:26,154 --> 01:49:27,064
No.

1104
01:49:27,314 --> 01:49:29,032
Can't walk too good either.

1105
01:49:29,754 --> 01:49:31,506
So why are you here?

1106
01:49:32,074 --> 01:49:33,587
l know stuff.

1107
01:49:39,194 --> 01:49:40,513
Where did you get that?

1108
01:49:43,834 --> 01:49:45,950
1 970.

1109
01:49:46,914 --> 01:49:49,223
A girl with eyes as big as saucers. . .

1110
01:49:49,474 --> 01:49:51,908
. . .did me in a little town
called Saigon.

1111
01:50:09,994 --> 01:50:12,462
Ford wants me to have his place.

1112
01:50:13,634 --> 01:50:14,749
Said it's the best.

1113
01:50:18,634 --> 01:50:19,783
l'm on the other side.

1114
01:50:23,114 --> 01:50:25,070
l got plenty of room here.

1115
01:50:29,914 --> 01:50:32,508
So much for the uniform theory.

1116
01:50:39,434 --> 01:50:41,425
He was captured on the Oregon border.

1117
01:50:43,674 --> 01:50:45,392
Who the hell are you?

1118
01:50:45,634 --> 01:50:46,464
Carrier 1 2.

1119
01:50:47,874 --> 01:50:49,387
United States Oostal Service.

1120
01:51:04,034 --> 01:51:06,787
l want the camp struck at dawn.

1121
01:51:09,554 --> 01:51:10,907
We'll be moving north!

1122
01:51:16,394 --> 01:51:18,703
You spelled "tyranny" wrong.

1123
01:51:22,034 --> 01:51:23,672
l wish they'd stop saluting.

1124
01:51:32,834 --> 01:51:34,153
Just stay safe.

1125
01:51:35,354 --> 01:51:36,628
Remember. . .

1126
01:51:37,234 --> 01:51:39,145
. . .the mailman's more important
than the mail.

1127
01:51:40,914 --> 01:51:42,552
Boy, he's smart.

1128
01:51:46,634 --> 01:51:49,706
When l was a kid we used to turn
our hat around backwards.

1129
01:51:51,114 --> 01:51:52,911
Thought it was cool.

1130
01:51:59,834 --> 01:52:01,392
Jesus Christ!

1131
01:52:10,874 --> 01:52:11,909
Damn!

1132
01:53:17,594 --> 01:53:18,549
l missed him.

1133
01:55:04,034 --> 01:55:06,025
What's the name of this town?

1134
01:55:08,394 --> 01:55:09,747
We never named it.

1135
01:55:12,114 --> 01:55:13,706
l officially declare. . .

1136
01:55:13,954 --> 01:55:16,024
. . .Oostal Station Number 1 0. . .

1137
01:55:17,074 --> 01:55:18,473
. . .in Elvis, Oregon. . .

1138
01:55:18,714 --> 01:55:20,306
. . .open for business.

1139
01:55:22,994 --> 01:55:26,873
From now on you got to get your mail
down there, okay?

1140
01:55:27,834 --> 01:55:29,426
This one doesn't work.

1141
01:55:40,914 --> 01:55:42,347
Read it again.

1142
01:55:43,114 --> 01:55:44,229
Are you sure?

1143
01:55:44,474 --> 01:55:45,509
Yes.

1144
01:55:47,074 --> 01:55:49,588
"Dearest Mom:
What a miracle to hear from you. "

1145
01:55:55,674 --> 01:55:57,585
Stuff is getting better.

1146
01:55:58,074 --> 01:56:00,463
Stuff is getting better every day.

1147
01:56:04,354 --> 01:56:05,548
l don't know who you are. . .

1148
01:56:08,114 --> 01:56:10,469
. . .but l do know
l was wrong about you.

1149
01:56:15,074 --> 01:56:17,065
Got a letter for you too, Sheriff.

1150
01:56:29,994 --> 01:56:31,712
lt's from my sister.

1151
01:56:33,114 --> 01:56:34,513
Thought she was dead.

1152
01:56:36,314 --> 01:56:37,633
You thought wrong.

1153
01:56:57,874 --> 01:56:59,830
Would you like to dance?

1154
01:57:04,794 --> 01:57:06,910
Well, they say that you can never

1155
01:57:09,234 --> 01:57:10,826
Never go back home

1156
01:57:16,314 --> 01:57:18,384
And if you're bound to Wander

1157
01:57:21,354 --> 01:57:23,185
You're bound to be alone

1158
01:57:27,874 --> 01:57:30,024
You say l got no right

1159
01:57:31,394 --> 01:57:33,464
To feel What l feel

1160
01:57:34,394 --> 01:57:36,385
When l look into your eyes

1161
01:57:37,834 --> 01:57:38,983
Want to dance?

1162
01:57:39,674 --> 01:57:41,869
But that l dream of you

1163
01:57:42,794 --> 01:57:44,432
Most every night

1164
01:57:46,394 --> 01:57:48,305
Comes as no surprise

1165
01:57:51,754 --> 01:57:55,542
Well, l've been
Out on this road for so long

1166
01:57:58,194 --> 01:57:59,388
Far and Wide

1167
01:58:00,554 --> 01:58:01,703
Do l roam

1168
01:58:04,074 --> 01:58:07,828
But something in your smile tells me

1169
01:58:09,074 --> 01:58:11,668
l'm almost home

1170
01:58:29,514 --> 01:58:30,947
l Was lost in the dark

1171
01:58:31,394 --> 01:58:32,463
All alone

1172
01:58:34,154 --> 01:58:35,473
Till the light

1173
01:58:35,714 --> 01:58:38,103
ln your eyes shoWed me

1174
01:58:39,034 --> 01:58:40,387
l Was almost

1175
01:58:41,074 --> 01:58:42,985
Home is Where the heart is

1176
01:58:44,434 --> 01:58:45,389
And my heart goes With you

1177
01:58:46,554 --> 01:58:48,624
l Would travel till the end of time

1178
01:58:49,714 --> 01:58:52,069
lf that's What l have to do

1179
01:58:52,754 --> 01:58:55,427
Just to spend one night

1180
01:58:55,834 --> 01:58:58,189
Till your sWeet love light

1181
01:58:58,434 --> 01:58:59,787
Come doWn

1182
01:59:02,394 --> 01:59:04,669
Shining doWn on me

1183
01:59:18,314 --> 01:59:19,429
Hello.

1184
01:59:22,394 --> 01:59:24,032
Who do you talk to?

1185
01:59:24,314 --> 01:59:27,147
Not a soul in 7 years of trying. . .

1186
01:59:27,434 --> 01:59:28,662
. . .but l will.

1187
01:59:32,554 --> 01:59:33,623
Want some?

1188
01:59:33,874 --> 01:59:35,387
No, thanks.

1189
01:59:35,954 --> 01:59:38,229
Don't let the kids see that.

1190
01:59:38,594 --> 01:59:40,186
You go ahead, take a look.

1191
01:59:40,954 --> 01:59:43,343
l was an aerospace engineer.

1192
01:59:43,714 --> 01:59:46,786
l helped design
the Galileo Space Station.

1193
01:59:47,154 --> 01:59:48,143
No shit?

1194
01:59:48,394 --> 01:59:49,588
No shit.

1195
01:59:50,434 --> 01:59:53,426
l dream it's orbiting
the Earth forever. . .

1196
01:59:54,154 --> 01:59:55,746
. . .with a dozen human skeletons. . .

1197
01:59:56,674 --> 01:59:58,232
. . .all grinning at each other. . .

1198
01:59:58,914 --> 02:00:00,666
. . .laughing at us down here.

1199
02:00:11,914 --> 02:00:13,905
-What is it?
-lt's Tony.

1200
02:00:14,434 --> 02:00:15,787
He's overdue.

1201
02:00:17,834 --> 02:00:19,233
That makes 5.

1202
02:00:20,274 --> 02:00:22,105
All on southern routes.

1203
02:00:28,354 --> 02:00:29,992
Just children.

1204
02:00:30,634 --> 02:00:32,431
You bring me children.

1205
02:00:32,794 --> 02:00:34,466
l want a man.

1206
02:00:38,954 --> 02:00:40,626
We got births and. . .

1207
02:00:40,874 --> 02:00:41,863
. . .deaths.

1208
02:00:42,114 --> 02:00:44,503
Got weather.
Mostly gossip.

1209
02:00:44,794 --> 02:00:46,273
There's nothing here.

1210
02:00:46,714 --> 02:00:47,942
Nothing?

1211
02:00:48,794 --> 02:00:49,988
Everything. . .

1212
02:00:50,234 --> 02:00:51,553
. . .is here.

1213
02:00:52,474 --> 02:00:55,784
Am l the only one who sees that?!

1214
02:00:56,154 --> 02:00:57,143
What?

1215
02:01:06,474 --> 02:01:09,227
A military man,
especially a commander. . .

1216
02:01:09,474 --> 02:01:10,827
. . .should keep a journal.

1217
02:01:11,114 --> 02:01:13,150
After he's gone,
it's the only real defense. . .

1218
02:01:13,394 --> 02:01:16,227
. . .against the slander
that later arises.

1219
02:01:40,354 --> 02:01:42,504
Tell me about the other stuff you know.

1220
02:02:34,754 --> 02:02:35,630
Shit!

1221
02:04:16,554 --> 02:04:17,873
Get rid of the bodies.

1222
02:04:18,874 --> 02:04:21,627
l don't want these people blamed
for what we did.

1223
02:04:23,914 --> 02:04:26,951
Neither snoW, nor rain,
nor gloom of night...

1224
02:04:28,954 --> 02:04:31,548
... through bandit's hell,
through firefight...

1225
02:04:33,274 --> 02:04:35,663
... through flood and plague
We cannot fail...

1226
02:04:37,514 --> 02:04:39,982
...no Holnist trash
Will stop the mail.

1227
02:04:42,594 --> 02:04:44,744
You are now U.S. Oostal Carriers.

1228
02:04:47,394 --> 02:04:48,873
They changed the oath.

1229
02:04:49,554 --> 02:04:50,543
Ford's idea.

1230
02:04:51,434 --> 02:04:52,583
Figures.

1231
02:04:53,554 --> 02:04:55,829
They don't think to ask
who they're replacing. . .

1232
02:04:56,074 --> 02:04:57,189
. . .or why.

1233
02:04:58,074 --> 02:04:59,189
Sir?

1234
02:05:02,354 --> 02:05:04,584
lt'd be an honor
if l could shake your hand.

1235
02:05:06,714 --> 02:05:07,385
Do l know you?

1236
02:05:10,234 --> 02:05:11,633
l don't think so.

1237
02:05:14,394 --> 02:05:15,383
Good luck, then.

1238
02:05:24,794 --> 02:05:26,068
Nice kid.

1239
02:05:26,834 --> 02:05:28,790
He'll probably be dead in a week.

1240
02:05:29,034 --> 02:05:31,025
Now that is not your fault.

1241
02:05:31,434 --> 02:05:34,710
You're exhausted. You need rest.
There's food--

1242
02:05:36,514 --> 02:05:38,345
-Where are you going?
-Route 22.

1243
02:05:38,834 --> 02:05:41,029
You're grounded.
Get off the horse.

1244
02:05:41,954 --> 02:05:42,784
You know the rule.

1245
02:05:43,114 --> 02:05:43,864
What rule?

1246
02:05:45,234 --> 02:05:47,304
22, it's too far south.
Get off the horse.

1247
02:05:47,554 --> 02:05:48,828
But they're waiting on--

1248
02:05:49,074 --> 02:05:50,632
Get off the goddamn horse!

1249
02:05:52,954 --> 02:05:54,751
l'll tie him off to this one.

1250
02:05:55,154 --> 02:05:56,553
You can't keep doing this!

1251
02:05:57,474 --> 02:05:59,066
-Doing what?
-Riding all the routes.

1252
02:05:59,314 --> 02:06:01,066
You're not saving anybody.

1253
02:06:02,954 --> 02:06:05,866
Did l ever tell you
how l got to be a postman?

1254
02:06:07,674 --> 02:06:09,392
l don't know if you'd laugh
or cry.

1255
02:06:14,634 --> 02:06:15,623
What is it?

1256
02:06:17,434 --> 02:06:18,184
Watch out!

1257
02:06:25,714 --> 02:06:27,113
We got fire! Move!

1258
02:07:01,234 --> 02:07:03,794
-"Oostage due. "
-Elvis patrol.

1259
02:07:08,994 --> 02:07:10,632
You want a war?

1260
02:07:12,194 --> 02:07:14,150
You want a war?!

1261
02:07:14,714 --> 02:07:16,306
l'll give you. . .

1262
02:07:16,554 --> 02:07:18,226
. . .a war!

1263
02:07:19,034 --> 02:07:20,387
l was. . .

1264
02:07:20,634 --> 02:07:22,909
. . .born for it!

1265
02:07:23,794 --> 02:07:25,386
You murderers!

1266
02:07:27,874 --> 02:07:29,592
You think you can ride?!

1267
02:07:31,034 --> 02:07:33,309
Then today's your lucky day!

1268
02:07:34,034 --> 02:07:35,547
Bethlehem says...

1269
02:07:36,394 --> 02:07:37,827
...he's headed north.

1270
02:07:39,074 --> 02:07:41,304
He's going to kill 10 people
in every toWn...

1271
02:07:41,554 --> 02:07:43,909
... then burn it to the ground
for What you did.

1272
02:07:45,594 --> 02:07:47,710
He said that PinevieW's on his Way.

1273
02:07:49,234 --> 02:07:51,225
He'd wait there for you,
but not for long.

1274
02:07:53,434 --> 02:07:55,152
l was so scared, sir.

1275
02:07:55,474 --> 02:07:57,749
l thought
they were going to kill me too.

1276
02:08:04,794 --> 02:08:05,624
See?

1277
02:08:05,874 --> 02:08:07,910
We're too late. l told you.

1278
02:08:08,354 --> 02:08:09,548
What're you going to do?

1279
02:08:09,794 --> 02:08:11,273
l'm going to stop this.

1280
02:08:11,994 --> 02:08:12,744
You can't.

1281
02:08:13,034 --> 02:08:14,990
Get out of the way, Ford.
All of you!

1282
02:08:15,234 --> 02:08:16,428
They'll kill you!

1283
02:08:20,194 --> 02:08:21,229
Hold him!

1284
02:08:24,394 --> 02:08:25,190
Stop it!

1285
02:08:26,794 --> 02:08:27,783
-You're hurting him!
-l'm not!

1286
02:08:28,034 --> 02:08:28,910
Yes, you are!

1287
02:08:29,154 --> 02:08:31,429
l'm not!
l'm not hurting him.

1288
02:08:32,354 --> 02:08:36,029
This is all my doing.
l went against your orders.

1289
02:08:36,794 --> 02:08:40,423
You told me to bury the dead Holnists,
but l sent them Bethlehem.

1290
02:08:40,674 --> 02:08:41,584
Why?

1291
02:08:41,914 --> 02:08:43,188
Bethlehem has to know
we won't stop!

1292
02:08:43,594 --> 02:08:45,266
Goddamn it, Ford!

1293
02:08:46,714 --> 02:08:49,023
Those people are dying because of us!

1294
02:08:49,274 --> 02:08:51,469
They're dying because of what we did.

1295
02:08:51,714 --> 02:08:54,023
They're not!
They're dying because of Bethlehem. . .

1296
02:08:54,274 --> 02:08:57,232
. . .because this is a shitty world!
lf we're going to change it. . .

1297
02:08:57,474 --> 02:08:58,987
. . .then someone might have to die.

1298
02:08:59,234 --> 02:09:01,907
lf l could make it be me down there,
l would, but l can't!

1299
02:09:05,154 --> 02:09:06,473
No! Olease!

1300
02:09:08,794 --> 02:09:10,193
-You, out here!
-Hold her!

1301
02:09:10,434 --> 02:09:11,662
Olease!

1302
02:09:28,074 --> 02:09:29,951
He's out there somewhere.

1303
02:09:31,674 --> 02:09:32,823
Watching.

1304
02:09:35,194 --> 02:09:36,912
l can feel it.

1305
02:09:40,154 --> 02:09:41,906
You feel it too, don't you?

1306
02:09:43,474 --> 02:09:45,669
lt didn't have to end
like this, Sheriff!

1307
02:09:46,154 --> 02:09:49,783
He knew where l'd be
if he wanted to face me like a man!

1308
02:09:50,594 --> 02:09:52,027
lnstead he's hiding. . .

1309
02:09:52,274 --> 02:09:53,627
. . .like a rabbit!

1310
02:09:54,034 --> 02:09:55,945
So much for your Oostman!

1311
02:09:56,714 --> 02:09:57,908
Lieutenant!

1312
02:09:58,834 --> 02:09:59,664
Ready!

1313
02:10:01,074 --> 02:10:02,587
We don't even know their names.

1314
02:10:03,714 --> 02:10:05,352
We know their names.

1315
02:10:10,354 --> 02:10:11,264
l think that's my dad.

1316
02:10:20,154 --> 02:10:21,269
Aim!

1317
02:10:22,074 --> 02:10:23,348
Ride, Oostman!

1318
02:10:23,914 --> 02:10:25,108
Ride!

1319
02:10:25,554 --> 02:10:26,623
You hear me?!

1320
02:10:26,874 --> 02:10:28,626
l said, "Ride! "

1321
02:10:30,074 --> 02:10:30,904
Fire!

1322
02:10:53,634 --> 02:10:55,704
My God, what have l done?

1323
02:10:58,554 --> 02:11:00,146
What Ford did was wrong!

1324
02:11:03,874 --> 02:11:05,865
But it doesn't change anything. . .

1325
02:11:06,114 --> 02:11:09,186
. . .for any of us, does it?

1326
02:11:31,074 --> 02:11:32,268
ls this everybody?

1327
02:11:33,354 --> 02:11:34,753
The rest are on the overdue list.

1328
02:11:36,154 --> 02:11:37,633
Then this is everybody.

1329
02:11:38,794 --> 02:11:40,830
Got a letter from the Oresident.

1330
02:11:43,194 --> 02:11:44,707
"Greetings, all carriers. "

1331
02:11:44,954 --> 02:11:46,546
Greetings, Oresident Starkey!

1332
02:11:50,674 --> 02:11:52,983
"l've been in contact with The Oostman.

1333
02:11:53,234 --> 02:11:54,952
And l've received all the reports.

1334
02:11:55,514 --> 02:11:57,106
l'm proud of you all.

1335
02:11:58,034 --> 02:11:59,945
ln dark days,
in a weary world. . .

1336
02:12:00,194 --> 02:12:02,549
. . .you gave everything
and asked for nothing.

1337
02:12:03,554 --> 02:12:05,943
You beat back despair
and replaced it with hope.

1338
02:12:06,714 --> 02:12:08,944
For that, your country
can never repay you.

1339
02:12:09,834 --> 02:12:11,347
But the price is too high. . .

1340
02:12:12,954 --> 02:12:15,991
. . .and l won't see any more
of my bravest die.

1341
02:12:17,554 --> 02:12:19,909
lt is my duty to hereby disband. . .

1342
02:12:20,154 --> 02:12:23,510
. . .the Oostal Service
of the Restored United States.

1343
02:12:24,314 --> 02:12:26,305
You are to burn your uniforms. . .

1344
02:12:26,554 --> 02:12:29,864
. . .and The Oostman
is to return to Minneapolis at once.

1345
02:12:30,634 --> 02:12:31,953
Thank you.

1346
02:12:32,594 --> 02:12:34,152
And God bless you all.

1347
02:12:35,034 --> 02:12:36,183
The Oresident. "

1348
02:12:53,194 --> 02:12:55,344
The Oresident never wrote that letter.

1349
02:12:55,834 --> 02:12:58,029
lf he could've,
that's what he would have said.

1350
02:12:58,354 --> 02:12:59,946
Who's the other letter to?

1351
02:13:00,194 --> 02:13:01,388
Bethlehem.

1352
02:13:01,874 --> 02:13:04,149
-l'm taking it to him in the morning.
-What's it say?

1353
02:13:04,714 --> 02:13:07,547
-Mail's private, you know that.
-What does it say?

1354
02:13:08,914 --> 02:13:10,632
lt says it's over.

1355
02:13:10,954 --> 02:13:12,626
lt says we quit.

1356
02:13:13,714 --> 02:13:15,545
lt says you quit!

1357
02:13:16,154 --> 02:13:17,189
What about the oath?

1358
02:13:17,434 --> 02:13:19,072
Tell me something, Ford.

1359
02:13:19,314 --> 02:13:22,147
How much mail
can a dead postman deliver?

1360
02:13:23,354 --> 02:13:24,582
lt's over.

1361
02:13:29,394 --> 02:13:30,588
Then l'll take it.

1362
02:13:31,114 --> 02:13:32,467
l can't trust you.

1363
02:13:40,234 --> 02:13:41,872
lf this is the end. . .

1364
02:13:43,554 --> 02:13:46,546
. . .if this is the last piece of mail
that ever gets delivered. . .

1365
02:13:48,994 --> 02:13:50,427
. . .l'll take it.

1366
02:13:52,314 --> 02:13:55,465
Whoever delivers this letter, Ford,
probably dies for it.

1367
02:13:55,834 --> 02:13:57,870
l'm still a postman!

1368
02:14:01,114 --> 02:14:02,069
You owe it to me.

1369
02:14:03,954 --> 02:14:04,909
l owe it to me.

1370
02:14:19,994 --> 02:14:21,666
lt's not Ford's fault.

1371
02:14:22,194 --> 02:14:25,823
He's not like you. He doesn 't have
your memories. None of them do.

1372
02:14:26,954 --> 02:14:28,512
This is all they have.

1373
02:14:29,394 --> 02:14:31,624
-lt's the only decent thing they know.
-What?

1374
02:14:31,874 --> 02:14:33,227
Being a postman?

1375
02:14:34,754 --> 02:14:36,426
lt's all bullshit, Abby.

1376
02:14:36,674 --> 02:14:37,743
All of it.

1377
02:14:38,594 --> 02:14:41,427
l took the uniform off a skeleton
to stay warm.

1378
02:14:41,794 --> 02:14:44,467
l made up the rest to stay fed.

1379
02:14:45,034 --> 02:14:46,149
There is no. . .

1380
02:14:46,394 --> 02:14:48,862
. . .Restored United States.

1381
02:14:49,754 --> 02:14:51,392
l figured it was something like that.

1382
02:14:51,634 --> 02:14:53,431
l'm going to St. Rose.

1383
02:14:53,674 --> 02:14:55,471
l'm taking you with me.

1384
02:14:56,234 --> 02:14:58,031
l've already packed your horse.

1385
02:14:58,834 --> 02:15:00,904
l know you don't want to hear it. . .

1386
02:15:01,634 --> 02:15:03,829
. . .but that's my child inside you.

1387
02:15:04,714 --> 02:15:06,670
l want to see it born somewhere safe.

1388
02:15:29,314 --> 02:15:31,066
l thought l recognized you.

1389
02:15:31,914 --> 02:15:34,906
General Bethlehem said you should be
on your knees when l do this.

1390
02:15:35,354 --> 02:15:37,106
l don't give a damn
what that asshole said.

1391
02:15:38,234 --> 02:15:39,826
The general is a great man!

1392
02:15:44,194 --> 02:15:46,389
The general is a fucking lunatic.

1393
02:15:51,514 --> 02:15:52,993
You want to see a man?

1394
02:15:53,994 --> 02:15:55,347
That's a man.

1395
02:15:59,354 --> 02:16:00,423
You ready?

1396
02:16:04,554 --> 02:16:05,669
Yes.

1397
02:16:09,114 --> 02:16:11,344
You're a better man than Bethlehem.

1398
02:16:12,394 --> 02:16:13,588
l've seen it.

1399
02:16:18,434 --> 02:16:19,503
"To Bethlehem.

1400
02:16:20,434 --> 02:16:22,345
This letter is my testimony...

1401
02:16:22,914 --> 02:16:25,189
... to the fact that there is no...

1402
02:16:25,434 --> 02:16:27,470
...Restored United States...

1403
02:16:27,794 --> 02:16:29,864
. . .and there is no postal service. "

1404
02:16:31,514 --> 02:16:32,867
He expects me to believe this?

1405
02:16:33,194 --> 02:16:33,944
lt's true.

1406
02:16:38,314 --> 02:16:40,430
l was there.
He disbanded the carriers. . .

1407
02:16:41,634 --> 02:16:42,987
. . .and rode west.

1408
02:16:43,314 --> 02:16:44,110
Traitor!

1409
02:16:46,954 --> 02:16:47,909
Then l've won.

1410
02:16:54,594 --> 02:16:56,869
Bring the one we found yesterday.
They can die together.

1411
02:16:58,074 --> 02:16:59,393
You traitor!
You're a traitor!

1412
02:17:06,234 --> 02:17:08,190
That one's the second-in-command.

1413
02:17:08,434 --> 02:17:10,550
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1414
02:17:13,874 --> 02:17:15,353
l was thinking, sir. . .

1415
02:17:16,834 --> 02:17:19,746
. . .he might be more valuable to us
as a prisoner.

1416
02:17:20,914 --> 02:17:22,825
You were supposed to kill him. . .

1417
02:17:23,074 --> 02:17:24,143
. . .weren't you?

1418
02:17:25,554 --> 02:17:27,306
l couldn't get close enough.

1419
02:17:47,594 --> 02:17:48,663
Who are you?

1420
02:17:49,634 --> 02:17:51,192
My name's Clark.

1421
02:17:51,434 --> 02:17:54,107
Oostal Carrier
for the Restored Republic of California.

1422
02:17:54,674 --> 02:17:55,709
Who are you?

1423
02:18:01,674 --> 02:18:04,108
Oostmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury.

1424
02:18:12,394 --> 02:18:13,622
lt's an honor.

1425
02:18:17,034 --> 02:18:17,864
Wait!

1426
02:18:19,954 --> 02:18:22,024
Wait a minute.
Hold your fire.

1427
02:18:26,914 --> 02:18:28,393
You two don't know each other?

1428
02:18:36,434 --> 02:18:38,550
This'll never be over.

1429
02:18:39,074 --> 02:18:40,507
lt'll go on.

1430
02:18:42,034 --> 02:18:44,423
Except l'll be fighting
a goddamn ghost.

1431
02:18:45,434 --> 02:18:47,823
-Should we fire, sir?
-No, goddamn it!

1432
02:18:49,234 --> 02:18:50,906
l won't fight a ghost.

1433
02:18:53,354 --> 02:18:54,628
Tabula...

1434
02:18:55,314 --> 02:18:56,463
...rasa...

1435
02:18:56,714 --> 02:18:57,908
. . .gentlemen.

1436
02:18:58,834 --> 02:19:00,665
A clean slate.

1437
02:19:01,594 --> 02:19:04,472
l want all mail carriers hunted down.

1438
02:19:05,234 --> 02:19:07,543
l want The Oostman found.

1439
02:19:07,794 --> 02:19:09,625
l want him dealt with.

1440
02:19:10,554 --> 02:19:12,112
Colonel, organize the scouts.

1441
02:19:13,874 --> 02:19:14,989
You said he rode west?

1442
02:19:20,314 --> 02:19:22,032
And this is his second-in-command?

1443
02:19:25,954 --> 02:19:27,069
Yes, sir!

1444
02:19:39,794 --> 02:19:42,945
l'll keep you to bargain with.
The Oostman is weak that way.

1445
02:20:31,514 --> 02:20:33,345
Set your rifle on the ground!

1446
02:20:34,034 --> 02:20:35,865
Set it on the ground.

1447
02:20:37,434 --> 02:20:39,504
What? This old thing?

1448
02:20:41,034 --> 02:20:42,103
lt isn't even loaded.

1449
02:20:43,394 --> 02:20:44,827
Where are we?

1450
02:20:45,874 --> 02:20:47,785
You're in Bridge City. . .

1451
02:20:49,634 --> 02:20:51,590
. . .where we don't allow guns.

1452
02:21:01,674 --> 02:21:03,346
The sentry said you were coming.

1453
02:21:11,034 --> 02:21:12,911
l know you. You're. . .

1454
02:21:13,474 --> 02:21:14,190
. . .famous.

1455
02:21:15,914 --> 02:21:17,267
l was once. . .

1456
02:21:17,514 --> 02:21:18,629
. . .sort of. . .

1457
02:21:18,874 --> 02:21:20,102
. . .kind of.

1458
02:21:20,434 --> 02:21:21,753
Not anymore.

1459
02:21:22,634 --> 02:21:23,430
Looking to cross?

1460
02:21:24,314 --> 02:21:25,463
We will be.

1461
02:21:26,394 --> 02:21:29,147
Right now we'd appreciate some food.

1462
02:21:30,834 --> 02:21:32,108
Okay.

1463
02:21:32,994 --> 02:21:34,393
There are some kids behind us.

1464
02:21:34,634 --> 02:21:35,510
How many?

1465
02:21:35,754 --> 02:21:36,504
3.

1466
02:21:37,434 --> 02:21:39,152
3. Okay.

1467
02:21:42,034 --> 02:21:43,626
Come on in, guys!

1468
02:21:45,914 --> 02:21:47,905
l know you're out there.

1469
02:22:56,834 --> 02:22:58,984
-Wait. Just wait.
-What did he want?

1470
02:23:00,674 --> 02:23:02,392
Hold on. He says. . .

1471
02:23:02,634 --> 02:23:04,750
. . .he's looking for The Oostman.

1472
02:23:05,234 --> 02:23:07,190
There's no such thing anymore.

1473
02:23:10,714 --> 02:23:13,467
The man on the horse says there is.

1474
02:23:13,954 --> 02:23:15,751
He thinks he's here.

1475
02:23:16,154 --> 02:23:18,190
And he's coming back with friends.

1476
02:23:23,394 --> 02:23:25,225
What's a postman?

1477
02:23:42,354 --> 02:23:43,673
You never heard of a postman?

1478
02:24:19,754 --> 02:24:20,823
Are you The Oostman?

1479
02:24:26,394 --> 02:24:27,383
Yeah.

1480
02:24:28,754 --> 02:24:30,472
l heard of you, man.

1481
02:24:31,354 --> 02:24:32,673
You're famous.

1482
02:24:34,554 --> 02:24:36,226
Yeah, l guess l am.

1483
02:24:37,874 --> 02:24:39,546
And all of a sudden,
l'm not. . .

1484
02:24:39,994 --> 02:24:41,871
. . .wearing the right clothes.

1485
02:24:55,834 --> 02:24:58,029
Man, you're going to love this!

1486
02:24:58,434 --> 02:25:00,994
Open that second chute, bro!

1487
02:25:16,954 --> 02:25:19,104
You have a gift, Oostman.

1488
02:25:20,634 --> 02:25:22,943
l saw it back in Oineview.

1489
02:25:25,354 --> 02:25:28,073
You've given us all back
what we'd forgotten.

1490
02:25:29,914 --> 02:25:32,792
You made Mrs. March feel like
she could see again.

1491
02:25:34,514 --> 02:25:37,904
You made Ford feel like
he was part of the world.

1492
02:25:40,754 --> 02:25:43,029
You give out hope like it was. . .

1493
02:25:43,274 --> 02:25:45,151
. . .candy in your pocket.

1494
02:26:00,674 --> 02:26:01,902
Remember this?

1495
02:26:03,594 --> 02:26:04,947
l remember.

1496
02:26:06,514 --> 02:26:09,233
l always like to think
that you left it on purpose.

1497
02:26:14,714 --> 02:26:16,670
This is hard for me.

1498
02:26:20,874 --> 02:26:23,866
Michael was the best man l ever knew.

1499
02:26:26,474 --> 02:26:29,910
l never thought there'd be another man
l could love the way l loved him.

1500
02:26:33,594 --> 02:26:36,154
l couldn't see it for so long.

1501
02:26:38,714 --> 02:26:40,511
And now you're leaving.

1502
02:26:44,794 --> 02:26:45,863
And l'm afraid.

1503
02:26:49,274 --> 02:26:51,742
l'm afraid you'll never
find your St. Rose.

1504
02:26:52,514 --> 02:26:53,310
lt's not important.

1505
02:26:53,554 --> 02:26:56,148
l'm afraid you'll never
see your baby.

1506
02:27:23,194 --> 02:27:26,869
l need full power, man!
This dude's got a long way to go!

1507
02:27:31,594 --> 02:27:33,585
This thing's working perfect, man!

1508
02:27:44,994 --> 02:27:46,950
A lot higher than it looks, huh?

1509
02:27:56,634 --> 02:27:57,953
You nearly went.

1510
02:28:00,674 --> 02:28:01,345
Get in.

1511
02:28:02,914 --> 02:28:05,428
There's 3 good-sized towns up ahead. . .

1512
02:28:05,674 --> 02:28:09,064
. . .with enough people to help you
if you can convince them to come.

1513
02:28:12,514 --> 02:28:14,152
Don't tell anybody. . .

1514
02:28:14,394 --> 02:28:17,511
. . .l like to ride this damn thing
just for the hell of it.

1515
02:28:17,754 --> 02:28:20,826
Being a city official
has its perks, you know?

1516
02:28:28,554 --> 02:28:32,103
Trust me, man.
This'll get you there a lot faster.

1517
02:28:37,514 --> 02:28:38,663
How do l stop?

1518
02:28:39,114 --> 02:28:41,264
Quit worrying about the little things.

1519
02:28:41,514 --> 02:28:43,391
Good luck, and Godspeed.

1520
02:28:58,914 --> 02:29:00,870
Reporting for duty, sir!

1521
02:29:01,114 --> 02:29:02,672
-KnoW What to do?
-Talk to the people.

1522
02:29:03,154 --> 02:29:04,473
Tell them
it's important.

1523
02:29:04,714 --> 02:29:05,942
Tell them
We can make a difference.

1524
02:29:06,994 --> 02:29:10,350
"Once more unto the breach,
dear friends, once more...

1525
02:29:10,594 --> 02:29:12,789
...or close the Wall With our dead!

1526
02:29:13,114 --> 02:29:16,948
ln peace, nothing so becomes a man
as modesty and humility.

1527
02:29:17,194 --> 02:29:19,833
But When the blast of War
bloWs in our ears...

1528
02:29:20,074 --> 02:29:22,110
... then imitate
the action of the tiger.

1529
02:29:22,354 --> 02:29:26,427
Summon up the blood.
Disguise fair nature With rage...

1530
02:29:26,674 --> 02:29:29,666
...and lend the eye
a terrible aspect. "

1531
02:30:11,394 --> 02:30:12,747
-Who are they?
-l don't know.

1532
02:30:12,994 --> 02:30:15,952
Looks like mostly women
and young people to me.

1533
02:30:16,194 --> 02:30:17,309
How many?

1534
02:30:17,714 --> 02:30:18,908
lt's an army.

1535
02:30:29,314 --> 02:30:30,747
At last. . .

1536
02:30:30,994 --> 02:30:34,464
. . .someone with courage enough
to bring the fight to me.

1537
02:30:38,754 --> 02:30:40,187
Reckoning, gentlemen!

1538
02:31:31,714 --> 02:31:33,830
They're an eager-looking bunch!

1539
02:32:00,594 --> 02:32:03,233
Morale is a dangerous thing.

1540
02:32:05,114 --> 02:32:06,911
Bring up the prisoner!

1541
02:32:07,514 --> 02:32:09,345
We'll show them
how this game is played.

1542
02:32:50,034 --> 02:32:51,353
Stay here.

1543
02:33:05,314 --> 02:33:06,303
ls he surrendering?

1544
02:33:06,714 --> 02:33:08,386
God, l hope not.

1545
02:33:29,434 --> 02:33:30,947
My little shipping clerk.

1546
02:33:31,514 --> 02:33:33,311
Mr. copy-machine salesman.

1547
02:33:34,554 --> 02:33:36,306
We're both a couple of frauds.

1548
02:33:38,474 --> 02:33:39,702
So be it.

1549
02:33:40,994 --> 02:33:44,464
But great men are made
by other great men.

1550
02:33:44,994 --> 02:33:46,188
Oatton had Rommel.

1551
02:33:46,794 --> 02:33:48,750
Grant had Lee.

1552
02:33:49,434 --> 02:33:50,389
But l get you.

1553
02:33:51,074 --> 02:33:52,473
You're no general.

1554
02:33:53,554 --> 02:33:54,828
You're not even a good painter.

1555
02:33:57,234 --> 02:33:58,747
Trying to goad me
into a fight?

1556
02:33:58,994 --> 02:34:02,543
lt'd be great if wars were fought
just by the assholes who started them.

1557
02:34:04,314 --> 02:34:05,713
We could settle this right here. . .

1558
02:34:06,874 --> 02:34:08,102
. . .you and me.

1559
02:34:10,034 --> 02:34:11,945
Unfortunately,
it doesn't work that way.

1560
02:34:12,194 --> 02:34:13,866
But it does in your army.

1561
02:34:14,874 --> 02:34:16,785
l invoke Law Seven. . .

1562
02:34:17,434 --> 02:34:18,503
. . .of the Laws of Eight!

1563
02:34:20,474 --> 02:34:24,228
"Any man may challenge
for leadership of the clan" !

1564
02:34:24,474 --> 02:34:25,190
l challenge you.

1565
02:34:25,434 --> 02:34:29,552
You're not a Holnist. You're not
a member. You don't have the right.

1566
02:34:29,794 --> 02:34:31,512
l have every right!

1567
02:34:37,154 --> 02:34:38,507
l invoke Law Seven.

1568
02:34:39,874 --> 02:34:40,750
Where. . .?

1569
02:35:03,154 --> 02:35:04,382
l challenge. . .

1570
02:35:04,634 --> 02:35:06,272
. . .for leadership of the clan!

1571
02:35:06,514 --> 02:35:08,027
Where do l know you from?

1572
02:35:08,794 --> 02:35:10,352
"Cry havoc. . .

1573
02:35:10,674 --> 02:35:12,710
. . .and let slip the dogs of war"

1574
02:35:13,834 --> 02:35:14,903
You remember that?

1575
02:35:17,314 --> 02:35:18,633
Shakespeare.

1576
02:35:19,354 --> 02:35:21,470
The one who didn't want to fight.

1577
02:35:22,114 --> 02:35:25,584
l should have found a way to kill you
then, but you seemed so strong.

1578
02:35:27,234 --> 02:35:28,462
Law Seven. . .

1579
02:35:29,754 --> 02:35:30,823
. . .it is!

1580
02:35:31,874 --> 02:35:33,751
This war is settled here!

1581
02:36:57,274 --> 02:36:58,866
l studied people.

1582
02:37:00,274 --> 02:37:02,105
l know your problem.

1583
02:37:02,754 --> 02:37:03,948
Do you know. . .

1584
02:37:04,194 --> 02:37:06,105
. . .why you can't fight?

1585
02:37:08,234 --> 02:37:11,385
Because you have nothing
to fight for.

1586
02:37:13,914 --> 02:37:15,825
You don't care about anything.

1587
02:37:16,834 --> 02:37:19,428
You don't value anything.

1588
02:37:19,874 --> 02:37:22,434
You don't believe in anything!

1589
02:37:22,674 --> 02:37:24,710
And that's what makes me better.

1590
02:37:26,954 --> 02:37:28,273
l believe. . .

1591
02:37:28,954 --> 02:37:30,990
. . .in the United States.

1592
02:38:08,994 --> 02:38:11,827
lt doesn't have to be this way.

1593
02:38:12,714 --> 02:38:14,909
We don't have to kill each other.

1594
02:38:17,114 --> 02:38:18,672
"Law Three:

1595
02:38:19,234 --> 02:38:20,462
Mercy. . .

1596
02:38:20,794 --> 02:38:22,227
. . .is for the weak. "

1597
02:38:22,474 --> 02:38:23,953
Ford, don't!

1598
02:38:24,194 --> 02:38:25,593
"Law Eight:

1599
02:38:25,914 --> 02:38:28,223
There's only one penalty. . .

1600
02:38:29,034 --> 02:38:31,150
. . .and that penalty is death. "

1601
02:38:36,714 --> 02:38:38,193
He isn't worth it.

1602
02:38:41,794 --> 02:38:43,750
l'm the head of the clan now!

1603
02:38:45,834 --> 02:38:47,552
There are going to be new laws!

1604
02:38:48,914 --> 02:38:50,233
Law One:

1605
02:38:51,954 --> 02:38:53,353
No more killing.

1606
02:38:54,234 --> 02:38:56,225
There's going to be peace!

1607
02:39:13,394 --> 02:39:15,305
How about it, Ford Lincoln Mercury?

1608
02:39:21,394 --> 02:39:22,668
Be a leader, Ford.

1609
02:39:25,834 --> 02:39:27,233
Law Eight:

1610
02:39:31,994 --> 02:39:33,268
Live. . .

1611
02:39:33,514 --> 02:39:34,993
. . .and let live.

1612
02:40:56,034 --> 02:40:57,831
Your daddy wrote to tell you. . .

1613
02:40:58,074 --> 02:41:00,634
. . .he'll be here as soon as he can. . .

1614
02:41:00,874 --> 02:41:03,342
. . .and that he loves you very much.

1615
02:41:10,954 --> 02:41:12,353
Mail's slow.

1616
02:41:13,794 --> 02:41:15,705
l'm going to have to see about that.

1617
02:41:46,794 --> 02:41:48,227
Your daughter.

1618
02:41:50,354 --> 02:41:52,345
Her name is Hope.

1619
02:42:21,834 --> 02:42:23,984
My father saW hoW fragile We are...

1620
02:42:24,194 --> 02:42:27,550
. . .and how quickly we fell
into the hands of tyranny.

1621
02:42:28,434 --> 02:42:30,106
He saw that ordinary men. . .

1622
02:42:30,354 --> 02:42:33,505
. . .could reach deep within themselves
and find courage.

1623
02:42:33,834 --> 02:42:37,304
He saw that if we began to communicate
as a nation. . .

1624
02:42:37,554 --> 02:42:39,351
. . .we could become strong again. . .

1625
02:42:39,594 --> 02:42:40,788
. . .united.

1626
02:42:41,514 --> 02:42:43,744
But he never did see St. Rose.

1627
02:42:45,274 --> 02:42:46,593
He said. . .

1628
02:42:47,194 --> 02:42:49,105
. . .there was too much to be done.

1629
02:42:50,714 --> 02:42:52,113
He'd made a promise.

1630
02:42:52,674 --> 02:42:55,666
And in keeping it,
he traded one dream for another.

1631
02:42:56,234 --> 02:42:57,792
With no regrets.

1632
02:43:01,114 --> 02:43:03,469
And so, in honor of my father. . . .

1633
02:43:40,714 --> 02:43:42,272
That was me.

1634
02:50:24,514 --> 02:50:26,505
Subtitled by
GELULA & CO., lNC.

1635
02:50:57,448 --> 02:51:01,202
The United States doesn't exist!

1636
02:51:08,048 --> 02:51:11,438
l'm giving you a chance at a life
that means something.

1637
02:51:13,808 --> 02:51:16,038
Redemption is within your grasp.

1638
02:51:16,288 --> 02:51:17,687
You are required
to show yourself.

1639
02:51:17,928 --> 02:51:20,761
But l'm not with these people.
l'm just passing through.

1640
02:51:22,768 --> 02:51:25,965
l can see it in your eyes.
You are a dangerous man.

1641
02:51:26,848 --> 02:51:27,644
Kill him!

1642
02:51:30,408 --> 02:51:32,922
You just head back the way you came.
We don't give charity.

1643
02:51:33,168 --> 02:51:36,319
l'm a representative of the United
States Government authorized. . .

1644
02:51:36,568 --> 02:51:38,957
. . .by the Restored Congress
to reestablish communication route.

1645
02:51:39,208 --> 02:51:40,163
What's that mean
in English?

1646
02:51:40,408 --> 02:51:41,966
lt means
l'm your postman.

1647
02:51:43,408 --> 02:51:46,480
You are nothing but a drifter
who found a bag of mail.

1648
02:51:49,608 --> 02:51:51,200
l have a feeling about you.

1649
02:51:54,448 --> 02:51:57,008
l know you'll do what's right.

1650
02:51:57,568 --> 02:51:59,763
Who's responsible. . .

1651
02:52:00,368 --> 02:52:01,437
. . .for that?

1652
02:52:06,968 --> 02:52:09,323
A man came through with mail.

1653
02:52:09,568 --> 02:52:13,356
Said he was a postman. Said that the
government had been restored back east.

1654
02:52:13,608 --> 02:52:14,643
What government?

1655
02:52:14,888 --> 02:52:17,197
The United States Government!

1656
02:52:17,448 --> 02:52:19,359
How about you?
Do you have a letter?

1657
02:52:19,728 --> 02:52:21,525
l don't have anybody to write to.

1658
02:52:23,808 --> 02:52:27,198
l took the uniform off a skeleton
to stay warm.

1659
02:52:27,448 --> 02:52:30,042
There is no Restored United States.

1660
02:52:30,768 --> 02:52:34,761
You gave them back their memories.
You've given us what we've forgotten.

1661
02:52:35,008 --> 02:52:37,158
You have a gift, Oostman.

1662
02:52:37,408 --> 02:52:39,558
You give out hope like it's. . .

1663
02:52:39,808 --> 02:52:41,207
. . .candy in your pocket.

1664
02:52:43,688 --> 02:52:45,838
l want all mail carriers hunted down.

1665
02:52:46,088 --> 02:52:48,318
-You've got to stay out of sight!
-l'm a postman!

1666
02:52:48,648 --> 02:52:51,003
l want the Oostman found.

1667
02:52:51,488 --> 02:52:53,206
l want him dealt with.

1668
02:52:54,408 --> 02:52:56,524
How much mail
can a dead postman deliver?

1669
02:52:56,768 --> 02:52:58,167
We're not going to stop!

1670
02:52:58,408 --> 02:53:00,046
Somebody might have to die!

1671
02:53:01,448 --> 02:53:04,246
You can't keep doing this.
You're not saving anybody.

1672
02:53:05,368 --> 02:53:07,120
Did l ever tell you
how l got to be a postman?

1673
02:53:08,688 --> 02:53:11,043
l don't know if you'd laugh or cry.

1674
02:53:11,928 --> 02:53:13,646
Do you hear me, Oostman?!

1675
02:53:13,888 --> 02:53:15,958
l said, "Ride! "

1676
02:53:16,208 --> 02:53:19,006
You want a war?! l'll give you. . .

1677
02:53:19,248 --> 02:53:20,806
. . .a war!

1678
02:53:41,528 --> 02:53:43,325
There used to be a postman. . .

1679
02:53:43,648 --> 02:53:45,604
. . .for every street in America.

1680
02:53:46,808 --> 02:53:49,606
They wore uniforms and hats. . .

1681
02:53:49,848 --> 02:53:50,963
. . .just like this one.

1682
02:53:53,448 --> 02:53:54,563
Getting a letter. . .

1683
02:53:54,808 --> 02:53:58,039
. . .made you feel like you were
part of something bigger than yourself.

1684
02:54:00,248 --> 02:54:02,808
l don't think
we ever really understood. . .

1685
02:54:04,208 --> 02:54:07,678
. . .what they meant to us
until they were gone.
