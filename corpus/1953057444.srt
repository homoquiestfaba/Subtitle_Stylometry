1
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:02,888
SOME ONE WHO DRIVES ME CRAZY

2
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:08,891
WHO FILLS ME WITH FEAR

3
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,704
WHO'S THRIFTY

4
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,603
WHO PREFERS CASH TO FLOWERS

5
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:25,681
WHO ONLY LIKES MY BROTHER

6
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,319
WHO LOVES ME MORE THAN I LOVE MYSELF

7
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,684
WHO EMBARRASSES ME

8
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:40,198
WHOM I DON'T WANT TO RESEMBLE

9
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,600
THE FIRST WORD OF A LIFETIME

10
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:54,513
MAMA

11
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,400
Warming up!

12
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,601
One! Two! Three! Four!

13
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:27,510
Once more! One! Two! Three! Four!

14
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,482
Clapping! One! Two! Three! Four!

15
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:35,783
Up high! One! Two! Three!

16
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,880
Four! Stretch!

17
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,591
Thank you for
this wonderful day!

18
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,092
Let's eat!

19
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,998
What are you
doing today, hon?

20
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,298
Study English in the morning

21
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,204
- Read history cartoon books at 1.
- And?

22
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,300
Research the Louvre
at 3 o' clock.

23
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,309
And exercise at 4 o' clock.

24
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,506
Wow!
Busy! Busy! Busy!

25
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,809
Really busy!

26
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,076
- Apple!
- Chapel!

27
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,084
- Cap full!
- Cap full?

28
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,380
- Two, Three...
- Babble!

29
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:11,582
Babble?

30
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,084
Babble...babble...
Bubble!

31
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,594
Bubble! No?

32
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,000
Do you even know
what babble means?

33
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,901
Doesn't it mean to jabber?

34
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:29,305
Wow! That's my boy!

35
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,205
You're the smartest!

36
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,712
I hope this is good.

37
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,272
It's hot!

38
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,387
I'm off to keep
our country healthy!

39
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:47,290
I love you so much!

40
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,885
I love you too, mommy!

41
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,398
Lunch's in the microwave.
Make sure you exercise, okay?

42
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,798
- Bye, mom!
- Bye!

43
00:03:55,868 --> 00:04:00,601
# To the end of this world

44
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:06,612
# I will devote
entirely to you

45
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:10,775
# And hold you

46
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:16,789
# in my arms.

47
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,393
Min-hyuck.

48
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,996
Min-hyuck?

49
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,699
Hey Min-hyuck!

50
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,406
Was it my turn?

51
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,104
What are you doing?

52
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,711
I've always wanted to do

53
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,907
pantomime on the stage.

54
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,179
- Sorry?
- This is an orange.

55
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:49,688
Look.
I'm peeling it.

56
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,288
It's really easy.

57
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,792
Don't believe
there's an orange here.

58
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,494
Just forget
that there isn't one.

59
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,897
So sour!

60
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,596
You're good.
Very good.

61
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,699
What a loser.

62
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,610
- This is bullshit.
- Come on.

63
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,704
It would be easier
for me to pretend

64
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,772
to love an orange than her.

65
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,080
She's my mother's age!

66
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:23,989
How can I pretend I love
someone like that?

67
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:27,083
That's a bit too harsh,
isn't it?

68
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,991
This is professor HANG.

69
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,587
She's the hottest
singer in Korea!

70
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,291
Didn't you tell me
to try acting

71
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,493
when you were auditioning me?

72
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,300
Would you be able to act
in a situation like this?

73
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,599
Could you pretend to love

74
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,403
that wrinkled old granny?

75
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,910
- It's just acting.
- No it's not!

76
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,206
This is a scam!

77
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,976
Hey! Min-hyuck!

78
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,684
What's up with you man?

79
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,276
Have some orange, sir!

80
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:59,090
What's with
the orange today?

81
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,191
I was worried
about doing a musical

82
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,286
but the music's
quite elegant!

83
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,197
I feel good about this,

84
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,699
better than when I did
Madame Butterfly in 97.

85
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,292
You always feel good.

86
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,496
But your personality sucks.

87
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,300
I can't believe
Min-hyuck's an idol star..

88
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,000
He's got perfect body

89
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,099
but he's not
very bright, is he?

90
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,701
Idol my ass.
He's an idiot.

91
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:23,772
At least his voice isn't
too bad for a young man.

92
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,183
Hey! You think
they're your clothes?

93
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,380
Careful with those hot pants!

94
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,384
- Where to next?
- Home.

95
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,888
Hello, sir!

96
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,695
Yes, I'm in this one too.

97
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,899
They just insist they
can't do it without me.

98
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,599
I know, I know.

99
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,602
I'm incredibly busy.

100
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,588
Time to go.

101
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,693
KOO Seung-cheul!
You son of a bitch!

102
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,989
I'm a bit busy

103
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,394
so I gotta get going.

104
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:15,491
My boys will
get through to you.

105
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:19,197
You have something to say?
You say it!

106
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,001
How dare you kick me out and

107
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,199
Leave me with your boys?

108
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:26,712
We have to get rough if you
keep on lying like this.

109
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,905
Plus!

110
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:32,583
My boys punch better than me.
Got it?

111
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,280
I have no time to goof
around with you.

112
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,180
Fuck! God damn it!

113
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,693
KOO! How dare you!

114
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,100
I'm sorry,!

115
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,308
Grandma!

116
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,177
I told you it looks barbaric
to run like that.

117
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,777
And don't call me grandma.
I'm Professor HANG.

118
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:08,878
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

119
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,081
Bye, now.

120
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:11,780
Mrs. HANG!

121
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,485
You're home early!

122
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,494
We picked up some good pork.
Join us for dinner?

123
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,793
Yeah! Eat with us,
Professor Grandma!

124
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,801
We can't stink up
Professor HANG's house.

125
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,803
She'll freak out.

126
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:29,001
Plus, she's having just
a slice of tofu tonight, alone.

127
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,599
We can't cramp her style.

128
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,807
You speak as ugly
as your face.

129
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,507
Let's go in.

130
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,378
Sweetie, we're having tofu
for dinner today.

131
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,680
- No!
- it’ll be good!

132
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,276
- Just do it.
- I said no!

133
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,596
Hey!

134
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,505
Fuck!
Let go!

135
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,508
- What did you steal?
- Shit!

136
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,601
- Hey!
- I said let go!

137
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,407
It's just cheap yogurt!

138
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,505
Then you pay for it!

139
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,174
That's okay.

140
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,982
What'll become
of that rascal!

141
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,487
Sorry to scare you, sir.

142
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,386
- No, no.
- Thank you.

143
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,582
No problem.

144
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,091
Here.

145
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,789
Let's just say I bought
those kids that yogurt.

146
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,297
Here. Take it.

147
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,799
Then let me get you
a few things.

148
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:29,892
Just wait here for a bit.

149
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,994
Please.

150
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,082
- Mom!
- Well!

151
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:46,779
Is this my dear son?

152
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,980
There was crazy traffic jam!
Am I late?

153
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,990
- No, you're just on time!
- Good!

154
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,491
Smells so good!

155
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,992
- Dinner will be ready soon.
- Okay.

156
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,403
Samba samba samba samba!

157
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,205
- For you!
- Thanks.

158
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,708
Samba samba samba!

159
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,509
This is amazing, mom.

160
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,510
You've got magic hands!

161
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:21,083
It's not that good but
thank you anyway.

162
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,686
- Honey?
- Yeah?

163
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,590
- Say Cheese Please
- What's that?

164
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:37,702
If you keep on saying
CHEESE PLEASE like this

165
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,398
you'll get smiley wrinkles.

166
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,702
I'm just worried about
your face these days.

167
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,803
It's threatening
like a gangster face.

168
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:52,674
How can you say that to
a teacher? That's cruel, mom!

169
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,278
You have to go to
the hospital tomorrow.

170
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,687
- Okay.
- These are too thin.

171
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,583
I'm scared.

172
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,790
Scare of what, mom?

173
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,093
Don't you worry!

174
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,294
If anything happens I'll
set fire to that damn place.

175
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:14,601
Geez! What a potty mouth!
You're a teacher!

176
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:21,012
But I can't help
feeling anxious.

177
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,372
Come on mom!

178
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,975
I said don't worry
about a thing!

179
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,886
Just drop by at the hospital
then come home to pack.

180
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,889
I'll send you to Japan

181
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,391
for hot springs next week.

182
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,893
What?

183
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,895
I just got back from Canada!

184
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,794
Stop wasting your money on me.

185
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,698
But I like hot springs!

186
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,999
Why can't you
pronounce Canada?

187
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,006
Say Ka-Na-Da!

188
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,599
No! It's Canada!
Like the Gana Fish Sauce!

189
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,704
Here.
This is good for you.

190
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,576
Sweetie?

191
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,084
- Look at this.
- Yeah?

192
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,383
Hey lady! Listen
to my son's English.

193
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,887
What's bean
curd in English?

194
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,091
That's easy!

195
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,496
De... defireve.e.
In English, it's defireve..

196
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,494
I'm so proud of you, son!

197
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,695
Excuse me.

198
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,102
I just wanna help out.
I heard you speaking.

199
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,400
I'm an English teacher.

200
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,604
It's not defireve.

201
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:30,479
It's Tofu.
This is tofu. Okay?

202
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,474
He's a bit lost.

203
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,281
It's not defireve.

204
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,385
It's defireve...
Fierve! Okay?

205
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,189
Yeah, I hear you.
But it's no defireve..

206
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,196
It's tofu.

207
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,994
What the hell
is he on about?

208
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,399
You America?

209
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:53,597
- I'm an Australian.
- So you are!

210
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:57,506
He's speaking our language!

211
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:00,511
You speak Korean!
Why give me a hard time?

212
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:04,572
So how do you say that
in Australian?

213
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,182
- Tofu.
- Tofu?

214
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,688
Yeah.

215
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,088
Just say defireve just once.

216
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,888
Or get out of here.

217
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,091
- Okay?
- Tofu.

218
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:22,191
Right.
Get going.

219
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,499
You speak Korean so well!

220
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,197
How amazing!

221
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,604
Mom, don't even
talk to him.

222
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:32,701
No one who speaks English
calls that tofu!

223
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,008
We all call it defireve.

224
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,513
- I'm an English teacher.
- Right.

225
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,483
- Dumb bastard!
- Yeah, dumb bastard!

226
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,680
Go learn proper English,
you fool!

227
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,694
COULD YOU COME CLEAN
THE FRIDGE TODAY?

228
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,806
Of course I can!
What time?

229
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,608
6 in the morning?

230
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,774
You must be so pissed off.

231
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,884
But men are just like that.

232
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,080
What was that?

233
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,986
Oh my God!

234
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,190
Oh, shoot!
Are you okay, ma'am?

235
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,592
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

236
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,892
- Oh no.
- It's okay.

237
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,296
Shouldn't you go to a hospital?

238
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,492
No, there's no need.

239
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:29,898
- Go to a hospital.
- I'm okay.

240
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:30,799
I'm okay. Really!

241
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,997
I'm fine.
You can go.

242
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,199
It's okay. You can go.

243
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,903
Then let me buy
some yogurt from you.

244
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,413
Really?
You really don't have to.

245
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,876
Why don't you try this.

246
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,885
This is an instant solution.

247
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,581
When you drink it,
you poop out this much!

248
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,688
Okay then. I'll take ten.

249
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,691
Ten?

250
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,785
I mean, give me twenty.

251
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,797
Twenty? This much!

252
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,892
You're amazing.

253
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:07,302
What do you work
so hard for?

254
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,001
To travel around
the world with my son.

255
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:14,503
Is your son sick?

256
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,980
There's always new medicine.

257
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,279
My son will get better soon.

258
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,086
- Here.
- Thank you.

259
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,680
- Don't you worry!
- I'm sorry again.

260
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,986
- Bye!
- Bye!

261
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,390
Thank you!

262
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:34,797
What the hell
did you just say?

263
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,892
Where are you going?
Who told you to go?

264
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,296
You asshole!

265
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,206
- Calm down, sir.
- No.

266
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,001
You piece of shit!
How dare you scream!

267
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,476
Don't think we can do
it without you?

268
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,677
Please calm down!

269
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,083
You asshole!

270
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,587
Damn it!

271
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,600
They're out of organic stuff.
Just use this.

272
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,701
I don't know why
I even hired you.

273
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:20,011
The director seems pretty
ticked off. What's with him?

274
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,675
That idol quit.
He doesn't like me.

275
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,192
Hi, Professor KIM.
Yeah, I called.

276
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,193
Are you busy these days?

277
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,495
Wanna do a musical?

278
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,890
I'm in it.

279
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:46,099
The staff are best
in the country.

280
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,809
Just tell them
I recommended you.

281
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,207
They know who I am.

282
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,806
Right?

283
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,873
Get ready to go
to the lecture.

284
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,276
The organizers will
contact you soon.

285
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,287
I gave them your number.

286
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,481
Hey!

287
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,600
Mom, I'm here!

288
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,903
Hey, guys!
Look how much you've grown!

289
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,910
Walking already?

290
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,903
Hi Choco!
You're so cute!

291
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,381
Hey! Stop eating!

292
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,284
Where's mom, guys?

293
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,786
Hi, mom!

294
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,890
I'm home, mom!

295
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,189
Were you changing
the briquette?

296
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,490
I'll do it, mom!

297
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:49,193
So thanks to that,
she bought twenty more!

298
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:51,499
At this rate,

299
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,698
we'll be travelling
the world in no time! Right?

300
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,905
Here's hot water.

301
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,408
Bon appetite, mom.

302
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,780
I made you some sauteed beef,
your favorite.

303
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:07,080
Make sure you eat
all of it.

304
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,177
Don't let it go bad.

305
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,884
There, there!

306
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,289
Come on.

307
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:21,089
You cry so much,
just like my mom!

308
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,999
I'm the one who
should thank you.

309
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:30,101
When I come visit you
I feel like I'm seeing my mom.

310
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,010
I told you.

311
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:37,174
My mom couldn't
speak either.

312
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:45,182
You can hold my hands
for as long as you want.

313
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,786
Only doctors hold your hands
when you get old.

314
00:18:56,468 --> 00:19:01,804
What are you saying?

315
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:08,003
Are you saying that l
have to cut off one breast?

316
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,104
Yeah.

317
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:13,675
But you can always get
a breast implant later.

318
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,785
But what's the need
at your age?

319
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:19,985
Have you sobered up?

320
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:26,791
What am I going to do?

321
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,597
Mom?

322
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,999
Let's step out for a second.

323
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,005
- This can't be happening.
- She's your mom?

324
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,906
How hilarious!

325
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:46,777
Phone. Off.

326
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,482
What?

327
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,684
What are you doing?

328
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,494
If anything ever
happens to my mom

329
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:04,299
I'll carve out your nipples.
Both of them.

330
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,495
Got it?

331
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:10,801
Yes.

332
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:23,583
Why does your grandma drink
coffee in a cup like this?

333
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,283
Mom, what are
these fish called?

334
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,190
Golden Tetra.

335
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,389
They glow more than before.

336
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,597
They glow more
as they get older.

337
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,093
Do people glow more
as they get older?

338
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,804
Ask your grandma that.

339
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,009
She's a blinding star.

340
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,575
I'm just a dull
ordinary person.

341
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,180
- You're home early.
- Hi grandma.

342
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,306
- What is it?
- This is bullshit.

343
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,907
Fire me?
Professor HANG Hee-Kyoung?

344
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:27,179
This can't happen!
I won't let it! I won't!

345
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:37,795
Mom, is grandma crazy?

346
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,888
She's just very angry
right now.

347
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,595
I won't have that surgery.

348
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,601
I'm scared to get
sliced up.

349
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,776
I don't want to be
a breastless woman.

350
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,179
Over my dead body.

351
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,578
You know mom...

352
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,386
Modern technology is
so developed these days.

353
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,394
They can even turn a black
person into a white person.

354
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,295
It'll be over
in the blink of an eye.

355
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,889
Another blink,

356
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,298
and you'll have a new breast.

357
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:21,100
So there's nothing you
have to worry about!

358
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,301
What are you saying?
That I'll be uneven?

359
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,903
Why would you be uneven?
They'll make you a new one!

360
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,277
No! I'll be uneven!

361
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:35,286
I can't even go
to the sauna anymore!

362
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,184
That's what you're
worried about?

363
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:43,794
I'm uneven!
No more sauna!

364
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,703
I'm uneven!

365
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,976
What's this?

366
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,380
From that fall?

367
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,484
Ow...

368
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,795
- Thank you, Dong-sook.
- No problem.

369
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,396
- Thank you.
- Sure.

370
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:29,906
I put the food back
in the fridge.

371
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,808
Thank you.
See you soon.

372
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:44,283
Oh my god!
Dong-sook!

373
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,790
Are you okay?
What's wrong?

374
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,588
Dong-sook!
Wake up!

375
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:50,787
Are you okay?

376
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,991
What's wrong?

377
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,000
- I'm okay.
- What's wrong?

378
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,002
- I'm okay.
- Are you okay to stand?

379
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,002
Two months?

380
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:05,807
Even with the surgery?

381
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,906
The surgery won't heal you.

382
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,373
It'll just give you
more time.

383
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,283
It's also possible you won't
make it through the surgery.

384
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:18,982
Doctor, I am very healthy.

385
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,082
Even now,
I don't feel any pain.

386
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:25,687
Ovarian cancer is
usually symptomless.

387
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,994
Regular check-up is
the only way to prevent it.

388
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,391
You're a bit too late.

389
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,996
This can't be.
I can't be sick.

390
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:41,410
My son has Duchen's
muscular dystrophy.

391
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,472
He can live
for five more years.

392
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:47,780
I have to be with him.

393
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,383
We're supposed to go
on a world trip.

394
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,480
If you want,

395
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,082
you can get
a second opinion elsewhere.

396
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,492
Would my results
be any different?

397
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,488
I don't think so.

398
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,894
Sir.
You can't say this to me.

399
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,700
What about my son, then?

400
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,206
- Please calm down.
- I can't die.

401
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,300
Just five more
years, doctor.

402
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:14,106
What about my son?

403
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,977
Please help me.

404
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,777
Please doctor.

405
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,374
Don't do this, doctor.

406
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,384
Let's just calm down.

407
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,887
Wait. Please.

408
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:12,096
I was so beautiful.

409
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:22,613
When did time
pass by so fast?

410
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,286
Oh my!

411
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,687
Deok-soo!

412
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:42,099
Deok-soo!

413
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,900
Mom!

414
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,098
Where are you, mom?

415
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,004
Mom!
I got something for you!

416
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,982
Look at this, mom.

417
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:06,080
I bought you all this
from the department store!

418
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,284
Luxury bath lotion,
your favorite!

419
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,796
I also have
this sparkly thing!

420
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,297
I'm serious!
Get up and take a look!

421
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,392
Why even bother?

422
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,096
They're all useless anyway!

423
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:23,903
Come on, mom!
Geez!

424
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,303
Mom.

425
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,477
Let's just do it.
Get your surgery.

426
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:39,979
Then I'll do
whatever you wish.

427
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,889
You think you're Buddha?

428
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:46,390
Well no, but I would do
anything for my mom.

429
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:49,490
I would even split the earth
in two if you asked me to.

430
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:53,401
So tell me
everything you want.

431
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:59,606
It's not that
I want something.

432
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,804
Okay?

433
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,378
But there is someone
I want to see.

434
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,679
Who, mom?
Go on, say it!

435
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:12,079
Someone from my youth.

436
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,191
My first love.

437
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,191
First love?

438
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,305
I was nineteen years old.

439
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,002
Your grandma asked me

440
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,275
to bring a sack
of rice flour.

441
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,175
I was on my way
home struggling

442
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,877
with the heavy thing.

443
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,585
I'd skipped lunch and

444
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,681
my shoulder was killing me.

445
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,991
Just then a man came and
took my rice flour sack.

446
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,993
He was the second son of
the distillery shop family.

447
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,296
He was tall and handsome

448
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,305
And strong!

449
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:06,002
All girls in the village
were crazy about him.

450
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,602
And of all girls,
he chose me!

451
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,475
I felt so lucky!

452
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,091
He taught me how to sing.

453
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,493
He rode me on his bike

454
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,591
And made me flower rings.

455
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:41,004
Before he went
to Seoul to study

456
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:46,374
Everyday felt like a dream.

457
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,679
I' m sorry I'm late.

458
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:54,388
Looking back...

459
00:29:56,161 --> 00:30:01,690
It was the most
exciting day of my life.

460
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,394
Did you call me, boss?

461
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:38,594
Yeah.
You're good with films?

462
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,194
- Pardon me?
- Films.

463
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:43,297
- You mean movies?
- Look.

464
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:47,711
You playing smart?
Movies or films or whatever.

465
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:52,372
Do you feel that good when you
pretend to be that smart?

466
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,476
You have this thing
about being uneducated.

467
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,486
- I'm sorry, boss.
- It's an inferiority complex.

468
00:30:58,556 --> 00:30:59,784
I'm sorry, sir.

469
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,593
We're gonna
make a mellow film.

470
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,494
Find me an actor.

471
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:12,803
JANG HEE-KYOUNG
QUEEN OF OPERA

472
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:20,902
Mom!

473
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,082
Mom!

474
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,182
Mom.

475
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,986
What are you doing?

476
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,399
Are you okay?

477
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:46,904
You know how
I got this far?

478
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:51,504
You're gonna get wrinkles
if you keep on crying like that.

479
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:56,973
And your hair.
It's like a metal sponge.

480
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,288
It'll be okay, mom.

481
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,485
Don't cry.

482
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:41,389
- Dong-hee?
- Hi, sis. What's up?

483
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,188
Hey! Sang-hoon!

484
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,092
- Dong-hee?
- Yeah?

485
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:48,496
I have something
to tell you.

486
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:49,794
What is it?

487
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,802
- Sang-hoon!
- Dong-hee...

488
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,705
Sang-hoon!
I said come here!

489
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:01,108
Sorry, sis.
Sang-hoon's made a mess.

490
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,407
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

491
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,072
- Sorry, okay?
- Okay.

492
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,204
Shit, man.

493
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,491
Cheers!

494
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:01,195
The men here are good.

495
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,194
What the?

496
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:07,196
It's your first time
at this cabaret, isn't it?

497
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,397
Yes.

498
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:15,107
I couldn't help noticing you
when I was singing.

499
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:19,172
Is your name
'Ok' by any chance?

500
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,381
No, sorry.

501
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,381
- Get over here!
- Have a beer.

502
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,787
Where is he, bitch?

503
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,493
- Honey! Please!
- Is it that asshole?

504
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,598
Come here, you old fart!

505
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,492
Please stop it!

506
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,505
What are you waiting for?

507
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,006
Bring him here before
he gets beat up.

508
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,201
Yes boss!

509
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:54,677
Honey!

510
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:05,286
I can't believe my mother
fell for such a loser.

511
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:08,088
Damn it!

512
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,699
So.

513
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:18,398
You're Ok-joo's son?

514
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,602
Yeah.

515
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:23,106
Are you sure you're
HANG Deok-soo?

516
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,478
I know it's been a long time

517
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:27,882
but how can you
turn out like that?

518
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:33,988
She sure raised a good son.

519
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,288
Let me repeat.

520
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,692
I got it.

521
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,797
So you want me to
put on a show?

522
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:48,002
With my looks, I can pass
for a doctor or a lawyer.

523
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:49,903
Or even a CEO.

524
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,908
So just tell me
what you need.

525
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:56,310
I'm a pro at things
like this.

526
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,578
By the way.

527
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,882
How much will you pay me?

528
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,981
You'll give me
enough, right?

529
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,490
You ever tried human meat?

530
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,697
We have a lot of meat.

531
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,790
A lot of human meat.

532
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,097
We'll give it to you
if you want it.

533
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,604
Money or meat or whatever!

534
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,902
You'd better be
damn convincing!

535
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,203
I'll skin you alive
if you screw up!

536
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,006
Wrinkles and all!

537
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,707
Got it!

538
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:36,677
Okay!
Let's do it!

539
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,484
Yeah?

540
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,686
Mom?

541
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:47,494
What else would I be doing?
I'm teaching.

542
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,200
Hello, every baby!

543
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,193
Miss me already?

544
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,306
You want cabbage fritters?

545
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,780
Why here, of all places?

546
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,180
It's freezing.

547
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,886
It's your first time
to come outside like this.

548
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,080
Here.

549
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:20,494
- Drink this, grandma.
- No.

550
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,092
Just a bit!

551
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,595
- Yuck!
- Yuck!

552
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:33,107
Let's try to have fun
since we're here.

553
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,202
I'll put on some music.

554
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,387
How's my singing?

555
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,788
People will hate you
if you sing like that.

556
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,692
Close your eyes and
feel the music.

557
00:38:58,769 --> 00:38:59,997
Be confident.

558
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,595
What's that?

559
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,098
Like this.

560
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,375
Wow!

561
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,676
Our special guest
today is Kim Yoon-ji

562
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,779
the remarkable soprano singer
from the musical Loveholic.

563
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,288
Hello?

564
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,086
- Hello.
- Leave it.

565
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,788
Your role was originally sung
by JANG Hee-Kyoung, right?

566
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,193
Right.

567
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:37,291
I think the musical was too
challenging for Professor JANG

568
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,996
with her age and all.

569
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:43,403
I'm hoping that I can sing
better than her.

570
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,707
Excuse me,
but how old are you?

571
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,108
Twenty-three.

572
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,082
Hi, it's me.

573
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,680
You said you knew the chairman
of Haklim Foundation?

574
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:04,286
- Where are you going, mom?
- Can I see him right now?

575
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:05,885
What about the car?

576
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,988
I'll be right there.

577
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,191
Mom!

578
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,696
Hello!

579
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,497
This place might look slummy

580
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,009
But it's the only place in Seoul
that has cabbage fritters.

581
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:22,811
Right.

582
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,371
Deok-soo was an eloquent man.

583
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,781
It was tough finding
this place.

584
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:32,481
Do they taste like
in the old days?

585
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:35,582
May be he's become a judge.

586
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,184
I'm not sure
about these fritters.

587
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,197
What would you
like loser, I mean...

588
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:44,291
that man to have become?

589
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,404
It's not really what I want.

590
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,702
This is just
my own imagination.

591
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,509
Knowing how bold
and smart he was

592
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,673
maybe he's become
a successful businessman.

593
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,383
What do you want to do
when you meet him?

594
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:08,391
What would we do
at this age?

595
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,484
Just eat something delicious.

596
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,789
Something delicious.

597
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,887
Talk about the old days.

598
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:16,489
Go sing a song at a karaoke.

599
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:20,003
Watch a movie in a theater.

600
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:23,198
- Hey KOO! Long time no see!
- Eat an egg at a sauna.

601
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:26,710
Go up Namsan Tower
and sightsee Seoul.

602
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,769
by the old palace.

603
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:34,079
We can head to the river
when the sun is about to set

604
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:36,483
And go on a ferry.

605
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:40,883
Honey, this is
like a dream come true!

606
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,791
So tell me again.

607
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,388
This says that
Deoksoo is coming

608
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,490
to see me
from America, right?

609
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,298
I told you.
It says right here.

610
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,501
- So Mom!
- Yes?

611
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,701
You have to get the surgery.

612
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,608
I'm worried.

613
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,375
What if he doesn't
even recognize me anymore

614
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:07,576
because I'm too old?

615
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:08,777
No way.

616
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:12,185
Why did time have to pass
by so fast, damn it?

617
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,183
Aren't you going
to the gym?

618
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:18,494
Smart kids these days

619
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:21,087
sing and
dance so well.

620
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:24,796
Wait til she
sprains her back.

621
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:30,199
- Hi there!
- Yeah.

622
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,003
- Hi!
- Going somewhere?

623
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:33,509
Zip me up?

624
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:40,676
- Where are you going?
- To practice.

625
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:43,178
Practice?

626
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:46,586
I'm back on. Get ready.
5 minutes.

627
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,893
HANG Hee-Kyoung.
You're a coward.

628
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,197
- I'm not done peeling.
- What?

629
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,200
Do you really
have to do that?

630
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,905
What's it to you?

631
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,702
You already
have everything.

632
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,709
You should learn
to let things go.

633
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:09,007
How can you have such
endless greed?

634
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,774
What do you mean
I have everything?

635
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:13,180
Leave it!
Who told you to touch that?

636
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,182
Then what about you?

637
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:15,980
Don't you have
any ambitions?

638
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:18,583
I hired you
so you won't starve.

639
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,783
But you have no talent
nor ambitions.

640
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:23,088
Where you going?
Stay and listen!

641
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,293
You're just a servant for
your husband and kid.

642
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:29,899
What's your dream?
Did you even have one?

643
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:31,891
Why don't you answer that?

644
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,994
What's her goal?

645
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:36,505
- What does she want to do?
- I wanted to sing!

646
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:42,104
I wanted to be a singer!

647
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,183
So is your mom coming?

648
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:51,384
Way to go, Eun-sung!

649
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:54,383
Do your best.

650
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,996
# Before I knew it

651
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:12,501
# Wrinkles filled my forehead

652
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,703
# Oh my! Please!

653
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:18,771
# Let me be young again.

654
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,874
# Before I knew it

655
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:22,778
Mom!

656
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,088
Mom!

657
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,286
How vulgar!

658
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:43,897
I couldn't sing
after that.

659
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:45,601
So I gave up.

660
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,111
I hated my mother who was
embarrassed of me.

661
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,773
So I did everything
to despise you.

662
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,580
Vulgarly I got married
to an older guy

663
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:57,483
right after high school.

664
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:00,687
Vulgarly I had
a baby right away.

665
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:04,186
Vulgarly I became
your maid.

666
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:09,489
You're asking such a vulgar
person about her dreams?

667
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,695
You have a husband,
child and mother.

668
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,999
You have everything.

669
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,204
Don't you feel sorry
for your mother

670
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,799
who has nothing
but a voice?

671
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,401
Don't blame me.

672
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:23,210
You wanna sing?

673
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,679
You think singing is a joke

674
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:26,579
because you see me
sing every day?

675
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:31,087
Well,
let's listen to you.

676
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:32,179
Sing.

677
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:42,190
I felt sorry
for you these days.

678
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:49,403
I liked being next to you
and consoling you.

679
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:55,905
But I was wrong.
You're hopeless.

680
00:46:56,947 --> 00:47:00,075
Now I understand why dad
cheated on you.

681
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:04,682
So that's why you married
a loser like your dad

682
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,882
and completely infuriate
your mother?

683
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:08,481
Sing?

684
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,891
Let's hear you sing.

685
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,087
Music?

686
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:14,490
Don't you dare insult it!

687
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,503
Dad, I have to poo.

688
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:27,002
Let's poo.

689
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:31,578
What a nice surprise!

690
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,673
You're taking me out!

691
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,694
Look, mom!
That store's still there!

692
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:53,998
- Look, sweetie!
- Look at the bubbles!

693
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,287
Take this.

694
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:19,488
What's this?

695
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:22,393
- Vitamin.
- Vitamin?

696
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:35,508
It's so nice being out,
isn't it?

697
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:04,199
Sweetie?

698
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:06,601
Yeah?

699
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:10,271
I'm sorry.

700
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:12,874
For what?

701
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:17,284
Everything.

702
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:22,284
Don't do it again then.

703
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:29,899
I'm so sleepy mom.

704
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:33,001
I slept a lot
before coming out.

705
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,395
Let me give you
a piggy back.

706
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:55,084
- Wanna play rhyming game?
- Okay.

707
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,788
Elope.

708
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:02,092
Cope.

709
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,293
Mope.

710
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,901
Grope.

711
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:15,704
Slope.

712
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:18,980
Pope.

713
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,181
Rope.

714
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,004
Hope.

715
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:55,680
I like the word hope.

716
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,887
So I put it on my wall.

717
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:05,090
Hope will never abandon you.

718
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:09,292
It's you who abandons hope.

719
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:29,680
Mom.

720
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:32,281
Let's go home.

721
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:35,290
I'm so sleepy.

722
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:44,400
Okay.
Let's go home.

723
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,396
Let's live.

724
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:51,897
We'll be okay, baby.

725
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:54,803
Let's go home.

726
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:03,478
Mom!

727
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,586
Mom!

728
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:20,695
Are you sleeping?

729
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:24,397
- Are you home, baby?
- Yeah.

730
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:29,946
- Are you sick?
- No

731
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:31,277
Then what's wrong?

732
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:34,476
You're meeting
Deok-soo in a few days.

733
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:37,384
You'll have a wonderful date.

734
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:39,979
I'm not gonna meet him.

735
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:43,287
Yeah right.
Why not?

736
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,386
I hate everything.

737
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,897
What's wrong?

738
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,097
Did you eat dinner?

739
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:53,399
What the?

740
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:58,207
Look at me.

741
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:00,299
Look, mom!

742
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,373
Let's see you, mom!

743
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:05,573
What?

744
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:07,983
What's wrong
with your face?

745
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:10,076
Out of my way!

746
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:11,880
Move, idiot!

747
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:17,193
Where's the doctor?

748
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:21,390
- I need a doctor!
- What's the matter?

749
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:23,496
Come this way.

750
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:31,399
Why is she here?

751
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:35,604
I don't know what she did
but look at her face.

752
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,977
- Look at her!
- Let's see your face, ma'am!

753
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,072
Let's see your face!

754
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:43,176
It's okay, mom!

755
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,387
Did you burn yourself?

756
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:49,288
Is your face burnt?

757
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,883
- No.
- Huh?

758
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:52,087
I uh...

759
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:58,295
What?
What did you do?

760
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,095
Botox!

761
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,896
What's Botox?

762
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:05,202
Botox...

763
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:09,404
- Put ointment on her.
- Okay.

764
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:19,081
Are you mad?

765
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:21,887
No, I'm not mad.

766
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,185
Yes you are mad!

767
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:29,188
I'm not.
Let's go.

768
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,494
You are.

769
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:34,193
I said I'm not.
Come on!

770
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,897
No.

771
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:42,806
Are you mad, mom?

772
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:47,476
Here. I'll give you
a piggy back.

773
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:48,482
No.

774
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:50,485
- You are mad again?
- No.

775
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:52,487
- Piggy back, mom!
- That's okay.

776
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:56,082
Just get on my back.
It's okay.

777
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:04,890
- Happy?
- Yes. Happy.

778
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,299
Geez, mom!

779
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:11,705
You almost scared me
to death!

780
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:13,402
- Really?
- Yeah.

781
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,073
They said you'll be okay
after the treatment tomorrow.

782
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,674
- So don't you worry.
- Okay.

783
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:24,083
- I'm not mad by the way.
- Yes, you are.

784
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,781
- I'm not.
- You are!

785
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:27,982
I'm not!

786
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,686
- Mom.
- Yeah?

787
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:38,095
I'm so happy I have you.

788
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,494
I'm so happy
I have you, son.

789
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:44,802
- Really?
- Really.

790
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:48,002
I'm so glad!

791
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,171
- How do you feel, mom?
- Good!

792
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:51,178
- Good?
- Yeah!

793
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:53,477
- Then sing me a song!
- What?

794
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,882
On the streets?
That's so classless!

795
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,477
But you'll do it
anyway, right?

796
00:55:58,555 --> 00:55:59,783
How did you know?

797
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:04,192
One Two Three Four!

798
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,492
Samba samba samba samba!

799
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:11,591
My dear love!

800
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:15,499
Samba, samba,
samba, samba!

801
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:24,278
Be happy and smile
as much as possible.

802
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:26,875
Watch what you eat.

803
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,883
Fight lethargy
with light exercise.

804
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:33,980
Of course, doctor.

805
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,581
I'm getting better.
I'm getting better.

806
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:38,991
The key is to stay positive.

807
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,589
I'd like to book a flight
for two to Paris.

808
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:44,997
When would you
like to leave?

809
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:49,004
April 29th.
It's my son's birthday.

810
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,403
I'm all better.

811
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:02,077
Here comes the cake!

812
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:06,588
Happy birthday,
Sang-hoon!

813
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:08,886
I want to blow out
the candles after him!

814
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:11,392
You're not a baby!

815
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:14,486
- It's kimbap!
- You're six already!

816
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:16,088
Can you get me
kimchi, please?

817
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:18,396
Kimchi?
We have to get some out.

818
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:19,992
We ate it all.

819
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:23,405
- You do it.
- Come on...

820
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:25,998
My back aches.

821
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:27,406
- Okay.
- Thanks!

822
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:28,808
It's the one in front
of the door, right?

823
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:29,946
Yeah.

824
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:32,073
Your kimchi is the best!

825
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:35,984
Where is it, sis?

826
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:39,078
Second container
on the right platform!

827
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:43,082
I'll be back.
I'm coming!

828
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,689
Eat, guys!

829
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:50,297
- Wait!
- Here, let me see too!

830
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:55,302
You can see Paris
and New York!

831
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:56,497
What is it?

832
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:58,302
- Wait!
- Show me!

833
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:00,604
You're blocking it!

834
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,004
Dong-sook!

835
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:16,187
I um...
You know...

836
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:19,689
You know...

837
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:23,398
You said You know 1 3 times.

838
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:31,003
You know, I'm...

839
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,301
Sick?

840
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,476
A lot?

841
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:46,581
More than me?

842
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:20,389
But you can fight it,
right?

843
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:31,399
Of course.

844
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:35,699
I can fight it.
It's nothing.

845
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:24,684
YOU'RE A STAR OF TOMORROW!

846
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,293
Where are you?

847
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:20,802
Do what you want.
Follow your dreams.

848
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:24,068
Or you'll regret it.

849
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:29,082
I'm on your side.

850
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:33,784
By the way

851
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,051
Did your dad have
square jaw line too?

852
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,296
Hi sweetie!
We found mom!

853
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,279
Hi. Um...

854
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,986
I'd like to audition.

855
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:12,785
CLASS CANCELLED

856
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:17,790
Let's record your mom.

857
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:24,303
Way to go, Mom!

858
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:30,879
Oh Penny!
Please take me the way I am!

859
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,776
Am I that revolting?

860
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:51,999
Revolting?

861
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:02,601
These are my savings.

862
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:11,279
Sis.

863
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:13,385
Everything will be alright.

864
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,592
I know.

865
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:32,598
PRESCRIPTION

866
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:10,473
I'm just here to get
Yeon-doo's book.

867
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:13,674
Come give me a massage.
I'm in pain.

868
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:28,289
You do have strong hands.

869
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:38,498
# I'm crazy.
Crazy just for you!

870
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,606
What a freak show.

871
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:51,076
Come back to work.
I need you.

872
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:54,186
It's not my style
to take the taxi.

873
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:01,496
- Do you have a cold?
- Yeah, a bit.

874
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:04,389
Are you crazy?

875
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:07,697
Do you know how
important this concert is?

876
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:09,897
It'll be the end of me
if I get a cold.

877
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:13,706
How can you be
so thoughtless?

878
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:15,302
Go home!

879
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:20,272
What's your child to you?

880
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:23,182
I mean
What am I to you?

881
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:25,678
You don't know how
the world runs.

882
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:27,786
This isn't just about me.

883
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:29,381
It's about the whole concert.

884
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,187
You're right,
I don't know.

885
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,887
Then shut up and go home.

886
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:34,190
Hurry!

887
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:37,088
You're a nasty woman.

888
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:40,194
What?

889
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:44,703
I'm going on that audition
you just saw on TV.

890
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:48,005
I'm gonna go on it
and humiliate you.

891
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,178
Yeah right you will.

892
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,674
Stay right there!

893
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,579
Don't you feel sorry
for your mom?

894
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:01,084
I feel sorry for myself!

895
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:04,183
I feel sorry that I have
a mother like you!

896
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:10,089
Take your book,
you moron!

897
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:14,059
Come out, sweetie!

898
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:15,797
Breakfast is ready!

899
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:18,699
Hurry.

900
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:23,011
I'm gonna count to five.

901
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:30,280
Here I go.
One! Two!

902
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:33,186
Three! Four!
Five!

903
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:41,088
Sweetie?

904
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:46,401
Honey?
Are you in here?

905
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:52,498
Won-jae!

906
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:57,373
Won-jae!
Won-jae!

907
01:06:58,547 --> 01:06:59,571
Won-jae!

908
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:04,476
Honey!

909
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:08,385
Have you seen Won-jae?

910
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:09,583
No, sorry.

911
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:12,183
Where are you,
Won-jae?

912
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:13,387
Won-jae!

913
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:15,291
Won-jae!

914
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,197
Won-jae!

915
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,603
Won-jae!

916
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,369
Won-jae! Won-jae!

917
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:38,083
Won-jae!

918
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:46,387
Hello?

919
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:51,093
Who is this?

920
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:59,397
Excuse me.

921
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:00,965
I'm supposed to meet Dr. HIN
in Gynecology here.

922
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:03,273
- Have you seen him?
- No, sorry.

923
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:06,079
Dr. HIN!

924
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:08,873
Doctor!

925
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:11,078
Where is Won-jae?
Is he hurt?

926
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:12,177
He's fine.

927
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:18,386
He came to see me this
morning on my way to work.

928
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:19,792
Begging me
to save your life.

929
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:22,592
Doctor,
please save my mom.

930
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:26,101
Please sir!
Save my mom!

931
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:29,695
I don't want
my mom to die!

932
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,900
Please don't let her die.

933
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:21,582
Mom.

934
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:28,791
What are going
to eat in Paris?

935
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:32,693
Hmm?

936
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:36,394
Tuna!

937
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:38,706
How about in Italy?

938
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,408
Beef.

939
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:48,574
My little boy!
What do I call you?

940
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:50,380
My little puppy!

941
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:56,483
You're so cute
when you smile.

942
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:00,788
Sweetie!

943
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:03,190
Close your eyes.

944
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,101
Mommy's face.

945
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:17,468
Mommy's forehead.

946
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,476
Mommy's eyebrow.

947
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,287
Eyes.

948
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,300
Smile.

949
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:53,974
I'll be coming home
smiling like this.

950
01:10:57,152 --> 01:10:58,278
It's cold out.

951
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:01,881
Don't come here again.
Okay?

952
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:10,789
- You trust me, right?
- Of course.

953
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:16,003
Of course.
Of course.

954
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:19,106
My little puppy.

955
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:27,875
Baby, we have a problem.

956
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:32,281
Grandma's concert and mom's
audition are both tomorrow.

957
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:34,784
What should we do?

958
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:38,987
Simple. I go to Mom,
you go to Grandma.

959
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:43,095
How about the other
way around?

960
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:44,393
No.

961
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:46,693
No fair.

962
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,301
They'll both do well,
right?

963
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:56,875
But what
if I don't go tomorrow?

964
01:11:56,945 --> 01:11:58,173
Dead.

965
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:00,271
I'm dead, right?

966
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,880
Do you like me
or that game?

967
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:06,580
- You.
- Thanks.

968
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,496
You're so lucky
you're young.

969
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:19,493
Sorry?

970
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:22,703
Your mother
must be beautiful.

971
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:25,205
Your skin is so soft!

972
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:28,602
It's good to be young!

973
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:35,383
You know concert's
tomorrow, right?

974
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:37,180
Don't be late.
Got it?

975
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:47,689
I'm so lucky I don't
have a daughter.

976
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:55,599
Really really lucky.

977
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:01,402
Look who's calling!

978
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:03,968
Hello, my dear son!

979
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:08,574
Shopping again?
You just bought me last week!

980
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,279
Don't buy anything.

981
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:12,084
What a bitch!

982
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:17,081
Sir?

983
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:20,084
- Hmm?
- Just one more day.

984
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:43,677
- Do I look good?
- Of course you do!

985
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:46,384
You probably couldn't
sleep well last night.

986
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:48,286
Sleep a bit in the car.

987
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:49,984
No way!

988
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:52,390
What if my face gets
all puffy?

989
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:56,092
It's Mr. LEE. Hold on.

990
01:13:57,065 --> 01:14:00,501
- Hi, Mr. LEE!
- We have a problem, boss.

991
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:01,900
Yeong-man's boys got the old man.

992
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:03,198
What?

993
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:06,404
- Did they take him?
- Yes, boss.

994
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:10,275
He wants you to come
to Juliana Club.

995
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:12,479
I'm sorry, boss.

996
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:17,582
I'll be there.
Get the boys there too.

997
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:25,785
Mom!

998
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:28,889
Mom! Mom!

999
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:31,889
Are we there already?

1000
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:33,298
No. Um...

1001
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:37,099
It looks like
the plane will be delayed.

1002
01:14:37,172 --> 01:14:40,403
What?
What do we do, then?

1003
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,603
It won't be
delayed too much.

1004
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:45,270
Actually...

1005
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:50,377
Your hair style
is strange today.

1006
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:52,281
- Really?
- Yeah.

1007
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:53,378
Why did you do that?

1008
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:55,184
- It looks bad?
- Yeah.

1009
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:56,883
Really?

1010
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:04,394
Oh. Shoot.
It is a bit strange.

1011
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:06,696
Okay! I'll redo it!

1012
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:09,202
Great idea, mom!

1013
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:11,102
Let me just go
to school quickly.

1014
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,105
Okay.

1015
01:15:25,654 --> 01:15:27,281
KIM Young-man!

1016
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,188
Welcome.

1017
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:35,196
What the hell
are you doing?

1018
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:36,390
Me?

1019
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:41,798
I'm just having fun with
your mother's first love.

1020
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,804
Why are you shaking?

1021
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,703
Cold or scared?

1022
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:53,080
What do you want?

1023
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:00,487
Is it me?

1024
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:03,386
Take your shot.

1025
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:06,586
KOO Seung-chul.

1026
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:10,691
Hey, KOO!

1027
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:13,794
One!

1028
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:21,902
Three!

1029
01:16:26,548 --> 01:16:28,675
Four! Five!

1030
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:38,291
- Boss!
- Come here, you son of a bitch!

1031
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:44,291
Get that old man!

1032
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,674
I said get that old man!

1033
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:26,899
SURGERY CONSENT FORM

1034
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:29,967
Get ready for your surgery
at 4 o' clock this afternoon.

1035
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:32,777
I'm all ready.

1036
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:36,181
I'm sure you have
everything under control.

1037
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:38,082
- Right, sis?
- Right!

1038
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:43,984
Sis.

1039
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:47,387
It's Won-jae.

1040
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:57,900
My little puppy! You're up?
Did you have breakfast?

1041
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:03,108
I'm going
in for surgery now.

1042
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:04,975
I'll be out in no time.

1043
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:09,483
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

1044
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:12,281
Why the sad voice?

1045
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:13,981
Mom...

1046
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,124
You'll be okay, right?

1047
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,786
Of course!
Who am l?

1048
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:26,195
- My mom.
- Correct!

1049
01:18:27,169 --> 01:18:30,900
Your mom is the strongest
person in the world.

1050
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:35,500
We'll be taking you
into surgery.

1051
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:39,379
- Sweetie?
- Yeah?

1052
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:41,973
I love you.
See you soon.

1053
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,484
I love you too, mom.
See you soon.

1054
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:56,091
HOPE

1055
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:59,500
PLEASE DO NOT BE LATE
FOR YOUR AUDITION

1056
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:05,203
Are you scared, mom?

1057
01:19:06,775 --> 01:19:07,901
No.

1058
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:35,803
I know but what can I do?

1059
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:38,200
All the parents
are begging ne

1060
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:40,707
so I can't refuse.

1061
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:45,077
You're in good hands
with Mr. LEE.

1062
01:19:45,147 --> 01:19:47,377
Just relax and enjoy
your date, mom.

1063
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:51,180
Okay. It's too bad
but what can we do.

1064
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:53,585
It's not your fault you're
the most popular English teacher.

1065
01:19:53,655 --> 01:19:57,284
Thanks mom.
You're the best.

1066
01:19:58,059 --> 01:20:01,392
Have a great time, mom.

1067
01:20:03,665 --> 01:20:05,098
Ouch.

1068
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:07,601
Aren't you coming?

1069
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:10,795
Wanna see my mom pass out?

1070
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:16,500
I'm so sorry.

1071
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:22,283
We've planned everything
perfectly so don't screw up.

1072
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:23,783
I'll be watching you.

1073
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:27,781
I am the king of acting.

1074
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:29,983
Don't you worry.

1075
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:32,888
Yeah right.

1076
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:04,486
Mom...

1077
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:08,995
I miss you...

1078
01:21:19,774 --> 01:21:22,607
Two hours
to dress rehearsal.

1079
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:25,168
Yes, sir.
I'll be right there.

1080
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:27,471
Who is it?

1081
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:29,881
I'm cheering for you,
Mrs. HANG!

1082
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,486
I knew you'd come.

1083
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:36,089
Get Eun-sung to get me
a bottle of mineral water.

1084
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:38,682
She's gone for the audition.

1085
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:42,292
What? She really went?

1086
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:45,094
Yes, as far as I know.

1087
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:45,894
Where's my cell?

1088
01:21:45,967 --> 01:21:47,992
She probably can't pick up.

1089
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:49,195
Why not?

1090
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:51,705
She should be in
the middle of her audition.

1091
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:54,708
I'm going on that audition
you just saw on TV.

1092
01:21:54,776 --> 01:21:58,678
I'm gonna go on it
and humiliate you.

1093
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:03,277
- Go start the car
- Pardon?

1094
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:04,978
- Hurry!
- Your flower

1095
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:06,179
- Now!
- Yes, ma'am

1096
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:16,689
I'm so nervous.

1097
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:21,098
Hi, dad.

1098
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:23,694
Okay.

1099
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:27,000
# Please forgive me.

1100
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:33,571
# Come back I beg you.

1101
01:22:34,049 --> 01:22:36,279
Thank you.
Pretty good.

1102
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:39,582
You don't have
a solid base.

1103
01:22:41,156 --> 01:22:42,885
You seem fake.

1104
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,289
Souless.

1105
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:47,089
Sol. Do Re Mi Fa Sol.

1106
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:48,789
PARK Eun-sung,
you're next.

1107
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,091
Okay.

1108
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:20,287
Let the film roll.
Que!

1109
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:02,496
- Ok-joo.
- Deok-soo.

1110
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:06,099
You're not him.

1111
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:08,208
It can't be.

1112
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:10,870
It's me, Deok-soo.

1113
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:16,081
- Who are you?
- HANG Deok-soo.

1114
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:20,383
- Massage here.
- Yes, sir.

1115
01:24:20,455 --> 01:24:20,887
Are you okay?

1116
01:24:20,955 --> 01:24:23,480
Hey. Which restaurant
did you reserve?

1117
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:25,082
The best one in Seoul.

1118
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,287
We ordered a full
course meal.

1119
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:30,490
- How about the theater?
- Theater, Karaoke, Sauna.

1120
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:31,589
We've rented them all.

1121
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:33,293
Well done.

1122
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:37,494
Now it's all up
to that old fart.

1123
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:44,975
It was a busy morning.
I'm feeling hungry now..

1124
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:49,381
It's not very
nice out, is it?

1125
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:51,282
Are you cold?

1126
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:55,482
Should we get you
something to put on?

1127
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:59,894
But my son always
takes me shopping.

1128
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:01,485
Actually...

1129
01:25:01,563 --> 01:25:04,896
there's somewhere
I really want to go.

1130
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:07,093
Where might that be?

1131
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:09,796
Hey!

1132
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:13,206
Come quickly!

1133
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:15,003
Get in!

1134
01:25:16,077 --> 01:25:18,671
Don't get in that, mom!

1135
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:36,691
Damn it!

1136
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:39,890
We're headed down
a rough path.

1137
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,198
- Quick! Get in!
- Yes, boss.

1138
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:10,190
Move out of the way

1139
01:26:10,265 --> 01:26:14,099
A bike is coming!

1140
01:26:23,645 --> 01:26:28,173
This place might
look slummy

1141
01:26:28,249 --> 01:26:31,776
but they have the best
cabbage fritters in Seoul.

1142
01:26:32,754 --> 01:26:35,882
It's been a while since
you've had this, right?

1143
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:38,687
I had reserved the best
restaurant in Seoul!

1144
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:43,194
My son is so good to me.

1145
01:26:43,264 --> 01:26:46,199
He found these
places for me.

1146
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:50,704
Thanks for noticing, mom.

1147
01:26:51,172 --> 01:26:53,299
Oh yeah!

1148
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:57,367
Did I tell you my son is
a popular English teacher?

1149
01:26:57,445 --> 01:27:00,380
I knew that!
He's doing very well!

1150
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:03,884
What?
Have you met my son?

1151
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:10,184
No, not exactly.

1152
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:16,894
I meant, that's what
I've heard from others.

1153
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:18,193
I see.

1154
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:21,492
I'll tell you what.

1155
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:24,402
Let's go see my son
teach English.

1156
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:26,997
He speaks English
so well!

1157
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:31,067
His work's not far from here.

1158
01:27:31,646 --> 01:27:33,273
Why, mom?

1159
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:42,882
Actually...

1160
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:50,591
Why would I want
to meet your son?

1161
01:28:11,753 --> 01:28:14,586
You're right.
Let's not spoil this.

1162
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:17,786
Let's go for
coffee somewhere.

1163
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:22,088
Where you going now?

1164
01:28:30,371 --> 01:28:31,599
Don't you worry.

1165
01:28:33,074 --> 01:28:37,067
You'll be alright.

1166
01:28:37,545 --> 01:28:38,876
See you soon, okay?

1167
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:51,884
Auntie!

1168
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:54,494
Where's mom?

1169
01:29:01,969 --> 01:29:03,402
How about me?

1170
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:16,880
It's hot!
Be careful!

1171
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,184
Don't burn yourself!

1172
01:29:22,657 --> 01:29:24,181
- It's roasted well!
- Hot!

1173
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:33,593
Damn it!
Where the heck are they?

1174
01:29:34,769 --> 01:29:37,294
They got here 1 5 minutes ago
and gulped down their coffee.

1175
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:37,997
They circled this area twice.

1176
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:40,597
Answer my question.
Where are they?

1177
01:29:40,675 --> 01:29:41,801
This way.

1178
01:29:42,977 --> 01:29:44,069
Spread out!

1179
01:29:58,659 --> 01:29:59,591
Yes, boss

1180
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:01,992
Stick close to them and

1181
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:04,190
tell me what they're saying.

1182
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:05,391
Yes, boss

1183
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:07,595
Wait a moment, sir.

1184
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,402
Here I go.

1185
01:30:12,774 --> 01:30:16,005
Ok-joo, how are you
feeling today?

1186
01:30:16,077 --> 01:30:18,568
I can't describe it.

1187
01:30:18,646 --> 01:30:22,082
I was an old
fart living a dull life.

1188
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,674
But thanks to you

1189
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:26,879
I feel like
I'm in heaven now.

1190
01:30:28,556 --> 01:30:32,890
Did my mom just say that

1191
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:35,292
she was living
a dull life?

1192
01:30:35,363 --> 01:30:36,990
Are you delivering
this correctly?

1193
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:38,292
Yes, sir.

1194
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:40,995
Look, dumbass.

1195
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:46,297
Just tell me what they're
saying minus the emotions.

1196
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:48,001
You're giving me
goose bumps.

1197
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:52,173
I thought you might
find this useful.

1198
01:30:59,754 --> 01:31:03,087
- Ok-joo.
- It's nothing expensive.

1199
01:31:10,064 --> 01:31:11,691
Would you...

1200
01:31:14,869 --> 01:31:17,997
Like to come with me?

1201
01:31:22,577 --> 01:31:23,669
Sorry?

1202
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:24,975
Sorry?

1203
01:31:25,046 --> 01:31:28,482
What the hell's he up to?

1204
01:31:28,549 --> 01:31:29,675
Shit.

1205
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:40,384
My life-long wish was

1206
01:31:42,463 --> 01:31:45,591
...to see you before I die.

1207
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:51,001
Oh my god.

1208
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:53,802
You still had this
after all these years.

1209
01:32:04,051 --> 01:32:05,780
But after seeing you
like this

1210
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:10,487
I don't think I can
live without you.

1211
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,388
I don't think I can
live without you.

1212
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:20,698
Oh, Deok-soo

1213
01:32:26,073 --> 01:32:27,506
Boss!

1214
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:32,178
Hey! Hey!

1215
01:32:33,648 --> 01:32:35,980
You know...

1216
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:40,086
I've led a bad life.

1217
01:32:41,956 --> 01:32:45,392
My life's been a real mess.

1218
01:32:46,861 --> 01:32:51,093
But I think that
if I can just be with you

1219
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:54,198
I...

1220
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:59,100
I can live a decent life
like everyone else.

1221
01:33:07,148 --> 01:33:08,376
Really...

1222
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,678
Can l...

1223
01:33:17,558 --> 01:33:19,890
Can I really go with you?

1224
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:24,087
Would you?

1225
01:33:26,067 --> 01:33:27,193
Won-jae.

1226
01:33:28,069 --> 01:33:30,003
Your mom won't be
out for awhile.

1227
01:33:30,571 --> 01:33:32,698
Let's go and have lunch.

1228
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:35,105
We have to stay
strong for your mom.

1229
01:33:36,477 --> 01:33:37,967
It's okay.

1230
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:40,377
I'll eat with my mom later.

1231
01:33:44,151 --> 01:33:47,382
Then I'll go out and get
something to eat. Stay here.

1232
01:33:53,761 --> 01:33:55,194
Hurry up!

1233
01:34:10,144 --> 01:34:12,271
- KANG Eun-sung?
- Yes?

1234
01:34:12,847 --> 01:34:16,078
- You're a housewife?
- Yes.

1235
01:34:19,353 --> 01:34:19,876
Are you.

1236
01:34:19,954 --> 01:34:21,581
- No.
- Sorry?

1237
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:25,284
I'm not.

1238
01:34:27,862 --> 01:34:29,989
Weren't you
a back dancer before?

1239
01:34:30,965 --> 01:34:34,298
Right. I danced
on the back stage.

1240
01:34:34,368 --> 01:34:37,496
Let's be quick.
I have a cold coming.

1241
01:34:38,572 --> 01:34:40,802
This is so sweet!

1242
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:45,073
Is there a particular
reason why you're here?

1243
01:34:47,848 --> 01:34:50,681
I've wanted to sing
since I was young.

1244
01:34:50,751 --> 01:34:54,278
Why are you auditioning
so late?

1245
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:56,289
Because of my mother.

1246
01:34:56,357 --> 01:35:01,192
As a married woman it
must've been hard to get here.

1247
01:35:01,262 --> 01:35:03,196
Why do you want
to start singing?

1248
01:35:03,564 --> 01:35:06,795
- Because of my mother.
- Bitch!

1249
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:08,596
Mommy!
Mommy!

1250
01:35:08,669 --> 01:35:09,499
You're right.

1251
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:14,303
You should sing well just
like your famous mother.

1252
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:17,776
Your mother is HANG Hee-kyoung
the soprano singer, right?

1253
01:35:17,845 --> 01:35:20,575
- HANG Hee-Kyoung?
- From the musical Loveholic?

1254
01:35:21,248 --> 01:35:25,275
You're going to be singing
a pop music, not classical!

1255
01:35:25,352 --> 01:35:27,377
I'm really looking
forward to this.

1256
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:30,182
Let's see how you
compare to your mother,

1257
01:35:30,257 --> 01:35:31,781
the best soprano singer
in the country!

1258
01:35:41,168 --> 01:35:42,999
In the breeze...

1259
01:35:50,144 --> 01:35:51,372
Thank you.

1260
01:35:52,346 --> 01:35:53,677
Ma'am? Come.

1261
01:35:54,849 --> 01:35:56,874
I guess you're nervous.

1262
01:35:57,752 --> 01:36:00,380
You're so unlike
your proud mother!

1263
01:36:01,155 --> 01:36:04,591
Your mother never had problems
being cruel to others!

1264
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:06,592
That asshole!

1265
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:08,685
Let's hear it again!

1266
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:12,096
What's the need?
I said I have a cold.

1267
01:36:31,051 --> 01:36:32,382
I told you no to do it.

1268
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:36,389
Thank you.
The exit's on your left.

1269
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:43,191
I wanted to sing!

1270
01:36:45,266 --> 01:36:46,995
I wanted to be a singer!

1271
01:36:55,376 --> 01:36:56,570
Hey! KANG Eun-sung!

1272
01:36:59,046 --> 01:37:00,274
Grab that microphone.

1273
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:07,180
# In the breeze

1274
01:37:07,254 --> 01:37:09,779
# I can here love calling

1275
01:37:10,457 --> 01:37:14,393
# The love that left me

1276
01:37:16,163 --> 01:37:19,098
When darkness fades and
tomorrow comes.

1277
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:20,690
This is your story.

1278
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:23,193
Focus on the lyrics.

1279
01:37:23,971 --> 01:37:26,098
Close your eyes
and be confident!

1280
01:37:27,274 --> 01:37:29,504
- Let's go, mom!
- You can do it, hon!

1281
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:39,483
# When darkness fades

1282
01:37:39,553 --> 01:37:41,680
# and tomorrow comes

1283
01:37:42,556 --> 01:37:46,185
# My past days of longing

1284
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:47,192
You're great!

1285
01:37:48,462 --> 01:37:54,094
# Just might come back

1286
01:37:54,168 --> 01:37:58,502
# Come back to me slowly

1287
01:38:01,075 --> 01:38:05,569
# I won't cry anymore

1288
01:38:07,047 --> 01:38:11,279
# It hurts to say goodbye.

1289
01:38:13,153 --> 01:38:17,988
# Even if I leave again

1290
01:38:19,159 --> 01:38:24,791
# I'll give you all my love.

1291
01:38:25,766 --> 01:38:27,495
Everyone together!

1292
01:38:28,068 --> 01:38:31,196
# I can't remember

1293
01:38:31,272 --> 01:38:34,002
# But I can't forget

1294
01:38:34,475 --> 01:38:40,175
# The longing
when sadness passes

1295
01:38:40,247 --> 01:38:43,580
# Even when time passes

1296
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:46,586
# Stay by my side

1297
01:38:46,654 --> 01:38:51,990
# Just like now and forever.

1298
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:57,194
# Like now and forever.

1299
01:39:06,273 --> 01:39:08,400
She's glowing!

1300
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:18,479
How vulgar!

1301
01:39:28,062 --> 01:39:29,495
Thank you.

1302
01:39:32,666 --> 01:39:35,794
You're coming with me?

1303
01:39:45,045 --> 01:39:46,569
Yes.

1304
01:39:50,351 --> 01:39:51,784
In next life.

1305
01:39:52,953 --> 01:39:56,889
Your son will get
married and leave you.

1306
01:39:56,957 --> 01:40:00,893
Someday you'll have to
live your own life.

1307
01:40:02,062 --> 01:40:04,792
I'll do anything for you.

1308
01:40:34,261 --> 01:40:38,197
You know I married
a lowlife loser

1309
01:40:38,665 --> 01:40:40,690
And got beat up all my life.

1310
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:48,105
I died over and over again.

1311
01:40:51,845 --> 01:40:53,972
You know who saved me?

1312
01:40:55,449 --> 01:40:57,076
My son.

1313
01:40:59,653 --> 01:41:01,280
To me,

1314
01:41:03,857 --> 01:41:05,984
My son is my guardian.

1315
01:41:09,863 --> 01:41:11,296
I..

1316
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:15,399
I can never leave
my guardian.

1317
01:41:47,668 --> 01:41:54,301
Son, you make me so happy.

1318
01:41:54,374 --> 01:41:59,471
Mom, you make me
so happy, too.

1319
01:42:34,548 --> 01:42:35,674
Forehead.

1320
01:42:38,452 --> 01:42:40,079
Eyes.

1321
01:42:42,956 --> 01:42:44,583
Then... Smile.

1322
01:42:54,868 --> 01:42:56,802
Surprise!

1323
01:42:56,870 --> 01:43:00,499
I thought you might be
alone right now.

1324
01:43:01,875 --> 01:43:05,675
I'm taking
my surgery very well.

1325
01:43:05,746 --> 01:43:07,976
So please keep your smile!

1326
01:43:08,849 --> 01:43:10,680
And pray for me.

1327
01:43:12,653 --> 01:43:13,984
I love you.

1328
01:43:16,456 --> 01:43:20,085
Hope shows magic
to its beholder.

1329
01:43:25,465 --> 01:43:27,194
HOPE

1330
01:43:29,770 --> 01:43:32,398
HOPE WILL COME TRUE.
BELIEVE IT, WON-JAE!

1331
01:43:35,075 --> 01:43:37,270
HOPE

1332
01:43:40,347 --> 01:43:42,679
EVERYTHING COMES FROM HOPE.
CHEER UP, SWEETIE.

1333
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:49,284
Hi there. I'm
the yogurt delivery lady.

1334
01:43:50,357 --> 01:43:52,291
Long time no see.

1335
01:43:54,261 --> 01:43:58,493
I've been a bit sick
so I'm getting a surgery.

1336
01:44:00,267 --> 01:44:04,795
The doctor says
that I could die.

1337
01:44:04,871 --> 01:44:06,600
But he's wrong.

1338
01:44:06,673 --> 01:44:10,074
I know I'm going
to fight through it.

1339
01:44:10,944 --> 01:44:12,673
Why?

1340
01:44:13,247 --> 01:44:15,477
Because I have to
keep my promise

1341
01:44:15,549 --> 01:44:20,680
with my son who is fighting
muscular dystrophy.

1342
01:44:22,256 --> 01:44:25,885
My son is just 11 years old.

1343
01:44:28,362 --> 01:44:32,992
He 's not even able
to come to the hospital.

1344
01:44:33,967 --> 01:44:36,595
He 's alone,

1345
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:38,604
probably praying
desperately for his mom.

1346
01:44:40,374 --> 01:44:45,471
Please help him fight
through this.

1347
01:44:47,347 --> 01:44:51,181
All he needs is
your message of hope.

1348
01:44:51,652 --> 01:44:54,086
Hope is his favorite word.

1349
01:44:56,256 --> 01:45:01,193
Those messages and your
energy will protect my son

1350
01:45:01,261 --> 01:45:05,288
and I believe
they'll save me.

1351
01:45:07,668 --> 01:45:11,104
I'm going to make
through this.

1352
01:45:12,773 --> 01:45:14,104
I have to.

1353
01:45:14,775 --> 01:45:15,901
I have no other choice.

1354
01:45:15,976 --> 01:45:17,466
HOPE COMES TO THOSE WHO DREAM.

1355
01:45:17,544 --> 01:45:23,176
STAY STRONG FOR YOUR MOM, WON-JAE!

1356
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:26,879
YOUR MOTHER WILL GET BETTER.

1357
01:45:34,661 --> 01:45:38,097
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

1358
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:48,103
Because I'm a mother.

1359
01:46:07,961 --> 01:46:09,189
Mom?

1360
01:46:22,175 --> 01:46:24,575
I don't like Edelweiss.
It's so outdated!

1361
01:46:25,245 --> 01:46:27,679
Edelweiss is
the fundamental of music!

1362
01:46:27,748 --> 01:46:30,080
You need a strong base.

1363
01:46:30,550 --> 01:46:31,983
And here!

1364
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:35,579
Every morning you greet me

1365
01:46:35,655 --> 01:46:37,885
It's not just
greet me here.

1366
01:46:37,958 --> 01:46:41,587
It's greet me
with a strong t' sound.

1367
01:46:41,661 --> 01:46:44,095
Got it?
From the beginning.

1368
01:46:46,566 --> 01:46:48,193
Nice.

1369
01:46:49,269 --> 01:46:50,896
Let's go.

1370
01:46:50,971 --> 01:46:54,304
# Edelweiss,

1371
01:46:54,374 --> 01:46:57,775
# edelweiss

1372
01:46:57,844 --> 01:47:04,773
# Every morning you
greet me. Hear it?

1373
01:47:06,753 --> 01:47:10,086
She's someone
I just can't hate.

1374
01:47:11,291 --> 01:47:15,022
- # Samba, samba, samba, samba!
- # Samba!

1375
01:47:15,162 --> 01:47:18,393
- # My dancing queen
- # Queen

1376
01:47:19,032 --> 01:47:21,762
# Samba, samba, samba

1377
01:47:22,569 --> 01:47:26,300
She's someone I thank
for just being alive.

1378
01:47:32,045 --> 01:47:33,774
Breakfast, sweetie!

1379
01:47:34,848 --> 01:47:37,373
Come on, get up!

1380
01:47:39,052 --> 01:47:42,180
I'm gonna eat all
of your favorite fish!

1381
01:47:42,255 --> 01:47:46,589
- I'm sleepy!
- One, two, three!

1382
01:47:47,961 --> 01:47:51,192
She's the strongest
person in the universe!
