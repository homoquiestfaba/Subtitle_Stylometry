00:00:01,032 --> 00:00:02,472
Hi, thanks for watching.

2
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:07,022
Me and my friends worked really hard
on this movie all summer.

3
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:09,843
I wanna thank them
for doing such a great job.

4
00:00:10,324 --> 00:00:11,884
Now, I'm proud to present:

5
00:00:12,484 --> 00:00:14,644
The Search For The Shadoweyes Bandit

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,819
They call me a dreamer.

7
00:00:23,569 --> 00:00:26,281
Nobody at the policing
takes me seriously anymore.

8
00:00:26,282 --> 00:00:28,262
I know they laugh behind my back.

9
00:00:29,297 --> 00:00:30,778
The only thing
that keeps me going

10
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,538
is my dream of revenging
the death of my partner.

11
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:35,559
Honey, I think you've had enough.

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,202
I'll tell you when I've had enough!

13
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,383
When are you gonna get over this,
he died years ago.

14
00:00:41,154 --> 00:00:42,714
He wasn't just my partner,

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,760
he was my best friend.

16
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:49,902
And I see it every time I close my eyes.
Close my eyes.

17
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:55,489
I found a clue that will lead us
directly to The Shadoweyes Bandit.

18
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:56,765
A clue, what is it?

19
00:00:57,309 --> 00:00:58,009
It's...

20
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:08,133
Zach.

21
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:09,659
Zach!

22
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:13,145
Nooo!

23
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:22,929
I know it's hard,

24
00:01:23,297 --> 00:01:25,320
I just hate
to see you like this.

25
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:26,221
I love you.

26
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,030
Zach, would want you
to move on.

27
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:31,030
The only way for me to move on
is to kill Shadoweyes!

28
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:32,711
You're a big dreamer,
Timmy!

29
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:36,261
I love that about you,
but catching Shadoweyes...

30
00:01:36,756 --> 00:01:38,196
it's just not realistic.

31
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:39,879
Maybe you're right.

32
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:44,239
That's why I want
more shots of alcohol.

33
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,757
Look,
I know I can't replace Zach,

34
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:56,193
but like it or not
I'm your partner now.

35
00:01:56,194 --> 00:01:57,634
And we are traffic cops.

36
00:01:58,407 --> 00:02:00,507
You know maybe in five,
ten years,

37
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:05,145
you'll make it to detective, then you
can go after a guy like Shadoweyes.

38
00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:07,025
Till then it's a pipe dream.

39
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,578
Everyone in this damn town
is telling me the same thing,

40
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:12,139
that I'll never catch him.

41
00:02:12,273 --> 00:02:13,413
In your dreams kid.

42
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,260
Déjà vu all over again.

43
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:16,482
My wife,

44
00:02:17,357 --> 00:02:18,057
my partner,

45
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:19,548
my Captain.

46
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:22,896
I do not wanna hear
another word about Shadoweyes!

47
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:24,097
Is that understood?!

48
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:26,486
This is an FBI investigation.

49
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,747
So if this pipe dream
of catching Shadoweyes

50
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:34,286
continues to interfere with your
real job which is writing tickets

51
00:02:34,902 --> 00:02:37,715
then you might as well
turn in your badge, right now!

52
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:38,916
Is that understood?!

53
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,630
Yes sir!

54
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:16,122
- Stop the car!
- What?

55
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:17,274
- Just stop the car!

56
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:20,045
- You, stop right there!

57
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:26,596
- Argh.
- I'm sorry.

58
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:30,878
Have you seen a man in a black jacket
run through here? - No.

59
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:32,107
Veronica?

60
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:37,075
What are you doing in here?

61
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:39,675
I've just been here drinking alcohol.

62
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:41,041
All by myself.

63
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:45,014
I've just been so lonely
after Zach died.

64
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:47,194
I know.

65
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:48,792
But don't worry,

66
00:03:49,252 --> 00:03:50,512
I'll find his killer.

67
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,540
I hope so,

68
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:54,168
but that won't bring him back.

69
00:03:54,622 --> 00:03:55,822
I've just been so...

70
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:57,408
lonely.

71
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:01,243
- What're you doing? - Are you
saying you never considered it?

72
00:04:01,244 --> 00:04:03,164
Your husband was my best friend.

73
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,028
And I'm a married man!

74
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:08,502
You married to a girl,
you can have a woman tonight.

75
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:11,083
I will never
talk about my wife like that.

76
00:04:11,326 --> 00:04:12,026
Help me.

77
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:14,616
Who are you talking to?

78
00:04:15,312 --> 00:04:16,692
Who are you talking to!

79
00:04:18,454 --> 00:04:19,714
You're setting me up?

80
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,360
It was you...

81
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:24,617
you set up Zach.

82
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:28,071
- Argh.

83
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:36,841
Bill, do you copy?!

84
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:38,715
They are all on my tail!

85
00:04:39,358 --> 00:04:41,111
I requested backup,
what's your 20?

86
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:42,372
South of Main street!

87
00:04:42,803 --> 00:04:45,743
Ok, be careful!
Shadoweyes has thugs everywhere.

88
00:04:57,647 --> 00:04:58,347
- Taste that.

89
00:04:58,991 --> 00:04:59,831
Was that good?

90
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:07,522
Now I hear,
you're looking for my boss.

91
00:05:08,714 --> 00:05:11,774
Be careful what you look for,
you might just find him.

92
00:05:13,852 --> 00:05:16,252
But let me
tell you something else cop:

93
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:17,246
I hate...

94
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:18,328
cops!

95
00:05:18,673 --> 00:05:20,233
Watch you chirping, birdy.

96
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:22,773
Let's discover it.

97
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,219
- Argh. Argh.

98
00:05:25,853 --> 00:05:26,653
- D'oh!

99
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:28,632
Do you want more?
Argh.

100
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:29,632
Here you crook!

101
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:32,021
Argh.

102
00:05:36,246 --> 00:05:36,946
Argh.

103
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,317
- Bill, come in.

104
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:00,229
Bill, do you copy?

105
00:06:00,989 --> 00:06:03,449
- Sorry, Bill,
is unavailable right now.

106
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,170
He is a little tide up.

107
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,359
Who is this?

108
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:11,758
- Hey, is this somebody
we should worry about?

109
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,199
No.
He's a traffic cop.

110
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:17,504
- I can't tell you
my real name,

111
00:06:18,548 --> 00:06:21,308
but my friends call me
The Shadoweyes Bandit.

112
00:06:25,507 --> 00:06:28,207
You'll never get away
with this, Shadoweyes!

113
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:30,446
Oh yes I will get away with it,

114
00:06:30,872 --> 00:06:34,089
just like I got away with
murdering your last partner.

115
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:34,810
You scumbag!

116
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:39,081
I won't rest till you are
behind bars!

117
00:06:42,787 --> 00:06:44,140
This is my town!

118
00:06:45,224 --> 00:06:46,184
Do you hear me?!

119
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:50,191
And if you ever talk to me like that
again kid, you're dead!

120
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:52,832
I kill your wife,
I kill your friends wife,

121
00:06:53,304 --> 00:06:56,038
I kill your neighbour,
I kill your neighbour's dog!

122
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,376
This is my town!

123
00:06:57,606 --> 00:06:58,757
This is my town!

124
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,060
You better just give up this
hero cop fantasy, kid.

125
00:07:07,424 --> 00:07:08,384
- What the hell!

126
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:10,733
He's behind you!
- Yeah.

127
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:13,726
- Argh.
- He is over there!

128
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:21,538
Hey.

129
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,108
Hey kid, hey kid, listen, listen.
I was, I was just kidding.

130
00:07:28,109 --> 00:07:29,969
I was kidding.
Listen, listen.

131
00:07:30,085 --> 00:07:32,425
We, we can do business
you and I. Yah.

132
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,640
I can make you a very good trade.

133
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:37,091
- What do you want?
- To lock you up.

134
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:40,408
You have a right to remain silent.

135
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:42,858
Anything you do or say,
can be used against you.

136
00:07:42,859 --> 00:07:45,119
- You can't do this,
I have powerful friends.

137
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,353
They will come and kill you.
I know Constantinople, Istanbul.

138
00:07:48,354 --> 00:07:49,054
- Shaddup it!

139
00:07:49,878 --> 00:07:51,618
Your time is over Shadoweyes.

140
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:54,507
Get used to a life in prison.

141
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:56,644
By the way, a nice hat.

142
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,870
- What you do in here?

143
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:11,566
- I've just been sitting here
drinking alcohol.

144
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:13,727
All by myself.
I've just been so...

145
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:15,534
lonely.

146
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,810
- What're you doing? - Are you
saying you never considered it?

147
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:23,164
Your husband was my best friend.

148
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:25,373
And I'm a married man!

149
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:32,807
Bill, do you copy?!

150
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:35,071
They are all on my tail!

151
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:38,199
Argh!

152
00:08:38,482 --> 00:08:39,182
Argh.

153
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,230
Argh.

154
00:08:40,569 --> 00:08:41,529
How that tastes?

155
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,856
I heard
you're looking for my boss.

156
00:08:45,188 --> 00:08:48,488
Be careful what you look for,
you might just find him.

157
00:08:50,293 --> 00:08:51,433
Quit your chirping,

158
00:08:52,056 --> 00:08:52,756
birdy.

159
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,210
The End

160
