1
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,057
- Sara Lee?
- I'm in here, Mama Wheelis.

2
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:15,625
I'm goin' out to cut some okrie.
Holler at me when they get here.

3
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,837
It's gonna be real nice,
everybody together again.

4
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:24,199
It's gonna be livin' hell,
and you know it.

5
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,767
I know it.

6
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:02,647
Shit, that's Lurlene!
I gotta quit sayin' "shit."

7
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:28,399
- Lurlene!
- Sara Lee!

8
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,635
Oh, it's so good to see you!

9
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,375
Lurlene, you look so good.
You look younger than me.

10
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,246
Oh, shut up. I do not.

11
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,050
I really appreciate you bringin' Daddy
home from the hospital.

12
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,887
Come on, Tiny Timmy.
Body slam that son of a bitch!

13
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,893
Oh, dear!

14
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,664
Lord, please help him.

15
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,928
He thinks he's watchin'
midget wrestlin' on the TV.

16
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,303
He doesn't even know
who I am, Sara Lee.

17
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:05,777
All the way down here, he kept
talkin' gibberish about a redhead.

18
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,370
That's Paulena Harlin.

19
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:12,111
She was that redheaded piece of trash
he had that affair with.

20
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,419
I didn't realize
Daddy was so bad, Sara Lee.

21
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,252
I wish you'd told me sooner.

22
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,155
I didn't think
anything about it at first.

23
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:23,286
I just thought it was one
of his temporary spells, you know?

24
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,388
I didn't wanna bother no one.

25
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:29,299
But last week, he started havin'
them progressive strokes.

26
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,236
Dr. Wetzel said
it was the beginnin' to the end.

27
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,933
That's when I called you.

28
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:38,739
- A week ago.
- I know it, I know it.

29
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:42,907
But J.D. was in revival, and I just
couldn't leave in the middle of it.

30
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,349
We had two rededications
and three professions of faith.

31
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,410
Well, praise the Lord.

32
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,918
We do, Sara Lee.
I hope you weren't bein' facetious.

33
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,323
I hope I wasn't either,

34
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,386
'cause that sounds like somethin'
I don't wanna be doin'.

35
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,091
I meant I hope
you weren't makin' fun.

36
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,762
No, Lurlene. Gosh!

37
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:08,068
I been goin' to church pretty regular
myself these days.

38
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,042
Even hit the choir
a couple of times singin' alto.

39
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,477
Get me the shotgun.
I'm gonna kill me a hound.

40
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,640
- What's wrong, Mama Wheelis?
- Just look at me.

41
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,480
That Heinz 57 mutt
of Clarabelle lvy's

42
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,986
tore my knee-highs,
uprooted my tomatoes,

43
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:26,355
dug a hole the size of Dallas
in my favorite flowerbed.

44
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:30,362
I am gonna call her
and warn her one more time

45
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,888
to keep that mutt of hers tied up.
Then I'm gonna kill him!

46
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,196
Mama Wheelis,
it's me... Lurlene.

47
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,763
Lord, I ain't seen you
in a coon's age!

48
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,103
Oh, honey!

49
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,909
I'm gonna stop at Bluebell's,

50
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,246
see if Sid'll give me
a discount on a case of beer.

51
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,310
Orville, please, I don't want
you drinkin' while we're here.

52
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,789
Just since when did you start tellin' me
what I could and could not do?!

53
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,111
Marlene, you wait out on the porch.

54
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,708
Woman in a bar ain't proper.

55
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,935
Looky here, Lurlene.

56
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,879
Me and Clarence
are finally gettin' married.

57
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,007
I'm not gonna be
an old maid after all.

58
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,076
Oh, Sara Lee,
I'm so happy for you.

59
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,645
I really do think
he's changed, Lurlene.

60
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:07,853
I wanted Daddy to give me away,
but in his shape, you know...

61
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,489
It just burns me up to think about
how many times he gave away Evalita.

62
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:16,729
She's divorced again...
I think it's number six this time.

63
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,203
I don't even know
where she lives anymore.

64
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,673
I had to call Jack
to leave word about Daddy.

65
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,870
Jack is the best husband
Evalita ever had.

66
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,379
Jack says she does call him
every now and again

67
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,939
to check on the girls
since she's lost custody.

68
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,350
I haven't heard from her
since she married that... foreign guy.

69
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,354
I just couldn't bring myself
to go to that weddin'.

70
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,481
Oh, honey, neither could I.

71
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,321
She sent us pictures.

72
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,861
The girl married in white... again.

73
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,897
I don't know
who she thought she's foolin'.

74
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,023
She's about as pure as mud.

75
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,533
Well, I guess we shouldn't judge.

76
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,665
But it is so hard!

77
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,950
- Take a left at the barn.
- Okay.

78
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,097
She had a date
two nights in a row.

79
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,192
She said that Friday night,
she went out with Arthur.

80
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,203
And that Saturday night,
she went out with Ben.

81
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:30,903
I said, "Arthur and Ben who?"
She said, "Arthritis and Ben Gay."

82
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:36,608
- How is Mrs. Fenwick?
- Oh, honey, she's dead.

83
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,616
Just eat up with cancer.

84
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:42,552
- Is that Marlene and Orville?
- No, Mama Wheelis.

85
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,884
Oh, my God,
you're not gonna believe this.

86
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,585
It's Evalita.

87
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,652
Well, spit in the fire
and call the dogs.

88
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,224
I'm a little nervous.

89
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,896
I haven't seen Evalita
in five years.

90
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:02,429
Count your many blessings.
Name 'em one by one.

91
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,877
Looky here, everybody.
It's Evalita.

92
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,578
And Harmony.
this is my new fiancé...

93
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,478
Harmony Gribowski.

94
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,260
You look real... good.

95
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,389
Harmony, I'm Lurlene.
I'm Evalita's older sister.

96
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,955
Nice to meet you, Lurlene.

97
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:32,667
Oh, my Lord!

98
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,135
Oh, Mama Wheelis!

99
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,201
Hello, Evalita.
How's one of my grandchildren?

100
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,803
Couldn't be better,
Mama Wheelis.

101
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,543
I'd like you to meet
my new fiancé.

102
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:48,485
This here is Harmony,
Harmony Gribowski.

103
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,681
I still ain't deaf, Evalita.

104
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,186
Howdy, hippie.

105
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,920
Howdy.

106
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,567
- Hey, Marlene.
- Hey, Clarence.

107
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,109
You lose weight?

108
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,469
- I did.
- I knew it.

109
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,813
- Hey, Orville.
- Hey.

110
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:25,379
- How's it goin'?
- Fine. Just fine.

111
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,755
Good.

112
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,953
- Asshole.
- Asshole.

113
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,908
Shit! Shit!

114
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,145
God, Texas is hot.

115
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,116
It sure is.

116
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,665
Oh, I saw Clarence Hopkins today.

117
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,100
I just had to stop
and say hello.

118
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,401
He hasn't changed a bit.

119
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,270
Me and him are engaged.

120
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:52,902
That's funny.
He didn't tell me a thing about it.

121
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,536
We picked this out together.

122
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,310
Last of the big-time spenders, huh?

123
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,184
But he's still
the cutest damn thing in Texas.

124
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,021
Yeah, he knows it, too.

125
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,691
And he had the tightest
blue jeans on, and no shirt, girl.

126
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,032
I had a hot flash
just lookin' at that sexy ass of his.

127
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:21,505
Trash mouth!
I'm gonna check the roast.

128
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,105
Evalita ain't got on nothin'
but her brassiere.

129
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:37,313
Maybe this'll teach you
not to play that damn radio, Marlene.

130
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,318
- Faster, faster. I need some speed.
- All right!

131
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,726
Dig in. Use your legs.
Take the pressure off your back.

132
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,196
Come on, that's it.
Dig in, girl. Move, move!

133
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,637
- Come on if you're comin'.
- I'm comin'.

134
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,977
- You all right?
- Yes.

135
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:06,017
If I could run down the street
in a brand-new pair of hose...

136
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,458
Marlene, grab them suitcases.

137
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:42,047
- Hey, look what the cat drug up.
- Hey, Sara Lee.

138
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,626
- Orville, you look good.
- Hey, Lurlene.

139
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,693
Orville, I'm here. I made it!

140
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,864
- I'll be damned.
- Probably.

141
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,564
Hello, everybody.
I've lost weight.

142
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,799
Nobody gives a rat's ass, Marlene.

143
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,001
Now put this beer in the icebox
and shut up.

144
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,943
You know how I feel
about beer in my icebox.

145
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,445
Hey, Mama Wheelis.

146
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,209
I have lost weight,
in case y'all ain't noticed.

147
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,914
Look behind you
and you'll find it.

148
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,987
I can tell, honey,
and you're pretty as a picture.

149
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,391
- Thank you.
- She's down to a ton.

150
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,729
You behave yourself.

151
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,823
He's just jealous, Mama Wheelis.

152
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,094
He's gained and I've lost

153
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,399
and you know how the heat
affects fat people... they sweat like pigs.

154
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,939
How'd you like it
if I just slapped you silly, huh?

155
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,235
Come on!

156
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,367
Stop that fussin'.

157
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,371
What the hell is that?

158
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,746
I'd like you to meet
my new fiancé.

159
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,693
Nice to meet you, Marlene.

160
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,021
- Oh, likewise, I'm sure.
- Nice to meet you, Orville.

161
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,659
Yeah, right.

162
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,433
Well...

163
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:12,002
Daddy still alive or what?

164
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,526
He looks pretty bad, don't he?

165
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,673
Have you read the will?

166
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,143
- No, Orville, I haven't.
- Why not?

167
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:57,188
'Cause it ain't the first thing
that crossed my mind,

168
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,656
like some people I know, Orville.

169
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,209
- You scared me.
- Sorry.

170
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,851
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

171
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,582
I just need to get
some fresh air.

172
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,784
- Shut up!
...don't have Daddy's will.

173
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:36,589
- Orville, where you goin'?
- Never you mind.

174
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,323
Well, excuse me.

175
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,057
Asshole.

176
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,098
What's Orville
so all fired up about?

177
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,632
He's gone down to Lawyer Pitman's
to look for a copy of the will,

178
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,009
but Lawyer Pitman don't have that will.

179
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,446
- Who does have the will?
- Daddy.

180
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,213
Daddy got it back
from Lawyer Pitman to revise it,

181
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,516
and then he didn't
get back to him

182
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,022
before he took
a turn for the worse.

183
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,250
I think he hid it.

184
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,725
Lurlene, would you please
return thanks?

185
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,489
May we pray?

186
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:19,027
Dear Lord, we come together
before Thee today

187
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,436
to thank Thee
for Thy bounty and Thy love.

188
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,735
Yes, Lord.

189
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,935
We ask that, as you draw
this family together,

190
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,411
that each one of us will realize
that love conquers all.

191
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,005
- Yes, Lord.
- I love my family, Lord,

192
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,984
and I ask that you will
take greed out of this family

193
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,511
- and replace it with love.
- Oh, Lord... yes, Lord.

194
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,750
Heal our daddy, Lord,

195
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,419
and bless this food
for the nourishment of our bodies,

196
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,520
and our bodies for your service.
Amen.

197
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,656
That was sweet, Lurlene.

198
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,600
- I doubt I'm in it, either.
- In what?

199
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,728
The will.

200
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:57,640
No, thank you.
I don't eat anything that has a face.

201
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,973
That's not what I've been told.

202
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,109
Here, Harmony.
Double up on those black-eyed peas.

203
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,243
Thank you.

204
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,947
I know for sure that he cut
me and J.D. out at one time.

205
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,616
And who knows
what it says now.

206
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:16,855
Although I really don't care since
we're financially stable, unlike some.

207
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,330
- Oh, brother.
- What did you say?

208
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,402
Nothin'.

209
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:29,237
If you have a comment to make,
why don't you just make it out loud?

210
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,407
I just think that Daddy had a right
to do what he did.

211
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,348
I mean, it's a free country,
and you and J.D. did run off

212
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,215
and leave him high and dry
to run the ranch all by himself.

213
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,186
But at least we gave him
five years of hard work.

214
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,223
All you ever gave him
was a lot of grief,

215
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,848
and five or six son-in-laws.

216
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:52,086
We all promised that we were
gonna get along with each other.

217
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:56,760
- We all have to try, Sara Lee.
- I'm doin' my part.

218
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,414
Get this. We just cut a record.

219
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,881
- Oh, really?!
- It's actually just a tape.

220
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,214
Well, anyway, a star is born.

221
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,452
It's all because of Harmony.

222
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,262
Lurlene! Mama Wheelis.
Y'all come quick!

223
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,827
Evalita's cut a record.

224
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:39,071
Lord, I hope I don't
have to go get my garden hose.

225
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,634
You cut a record?

226
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:43,272
Singin'?

227
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:48,081
I just went to Hollywood and made
a new movie with Elizabeth Taylor.

228
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,814
I, for one, would love to hear it.

229
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,355
I wouldn't.

230
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:56,590
Quite frankly, Lurlene,
it probably ain't your kind of music.

231
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,892
It's not that Jesus stuff.

232
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,295
Excuse me, Evalita,

233
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,163
but my musical tastes
are a little more eclectic

234
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,965
than just that "Jesus stuff."

235
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,336
Lurlene sings better
than you do, Evalita.

236
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,538
She used to sing
all them Patsy Cline songs

237
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,771
with Sid Cranford
at the Elks Fraternal Hall.

238
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,507
We've heard this story
all our lives, Mama Wheelis.

239
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,551
Thought maybe you might need
to hear it again.

240
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,280
Well, I don't.

241
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,720
I'm gonna go fix Buford's dinner.

242
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,920
You call me if there's
any more news flashes, hear?

243
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,757
Come on, Lurlene.

244
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,628
I'm gonna go for a little walk.

245
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,303
Get my rice cakes.

246
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,873
- Bye-bye, honey pie.
- Bye-bye, sweet cheeks.

247
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:53,113
- And he don't mean my face.
- Oh, I'm sure he don't.

248
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:00,514
Evalita, I don't mean
to get personal,

249
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:05,120
but just where the hell
did you drag that one up from?

250
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,862
That's a miracle
straight from God, Sara Lee.

251
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:14,437
- Right after me and Roger busted up...
- Roger?

252
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:19,171
He was that bronco buster
I lived with for a while

253
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,644
after me and Abdul got divorced.

254
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,944
Oh, you didn't know him.
Anyway, Roger was a nut.

255
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,450
Shoulda been committed
to Big Springs

256
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,884
in a padded cell
if you ask me.

257
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,022
He beat me up.

258
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,149
Threw me outta the trailer house.

259
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,059
I had nothin' to my name
but the clothes on my back

260
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,596
and a buck fifty.

261
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:43,394
- Told me to get gone or he'd kill me.
- Lord!

262
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,900
So I started hitchhikin'.

263
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:51,272
- You was hitchhikin'?!
- Sara Lee, I was desperate.

264
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,576
But now I know
it was God's will for my life,

265
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,911
because if Roger
hadn't have kicked me out,

266
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,884
I wouldn't have been hitchhikin',
and I wouldn't have met Harmony,

267
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:04,080
and Harmony was sent by God.

268
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,523
Evalita, that's the silliest thing
I ever heard.

269
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:12,052
You could take that theory
from husband one to husband six.

270
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,792
Somehow I don't think it's God's will

271
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,528
that you'd end up with
six husbands before you was 40,

272
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:20,127
and hooked up with
some hippie named Harmony.

273
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,669
And when did you become
the assistant to Jesus Christ Himself

274
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,540
to know His will for my life?

275
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:30,445
I have been goin' to church
a little more regularly lately,

276
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:34,110
and just last week,
Reverend Tuttle himself

277
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:38,316
preached a real good sermon
on the use and abuse of God's will.

278
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,483
Well, la-ti-da.

279
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,494
Sara Lee's been goin' to church,
so now she's an expert

280
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,462
on the use and abuse
of God's will,

281
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,998
'cause she heard
old fat-ass Revered Tuttle,

282
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,968
who, by the way, had an affair with
our illustrious soloist Mildred Keevner,

283
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,096
preach one of his
boring old sermons.

284
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:57,903
You wait one minute, missy!
That affair was never proved.

285
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,206
No, I won't wait a minute,
Sara Lee, God damn it.

286
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:01,336
Every time I come home.

287
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,313
You just hold on, Evalita.

288
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,044
The Lord's name
is sacred in this house.

289
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,608
Please stop.
You're gonna wake up Dad.

290
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,314
That's right.
All of ya just gang up on me.

291
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,016
Some things never change.

292
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,648
We're not ganging up
on you, Evalita.

293
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,125
We just all agree
that the Lord's name

294
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,526
is not to be taken in vain
in this house.

295
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,963
Wake up and smell the coffee,
Mama Wheelis.

296
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:23,592
This is the 20th century.

297
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:26,899
The Lord's name is the same
yesterday, today and forever.

298
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,098
Amen!

299
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:31,631
That affair was never proved.
That's just vicious gossip.

300
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,144
This has nothin' to do
with me sayin' "God damn."

301
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,736
Where is my razor strap?

302
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,840
You think you can
whup me, Mama Wheelis?

303
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,944
- I' m 33 years old.
- No, you're not.

304
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:47,651
You're 35 years old. I'm 36,
Orville's 38, Lurlene's 40.

305
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:48,954
That makes you 35.

306
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:53,123
Okay, so I'm 35.
So I lie, too.

307
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,632
I cuss, I lie, I cheat.

308
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,861
Sometimes I even steal ashtrays
from the motel rooms

309
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:58,960
where I commit adultery.

310
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,528
But I'll tell y'all somethin'...
I also live,

311
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,574
which is more
than I can say for y'all.

312
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,270
Daddy ain't the only one
dyin' around here.

313
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:09,802
Correction: Daddy's dyin'.
Y'all are dead.

314
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,175
Good-bye.

315
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:16,152
I sure have enjoyed
this little family get-together.

316
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,121
Don't go!

317
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:34,002
- What's wrong?
- My whole family was mean to me.

318
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,579
Honey, don't cry.

319
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,750
- I need a drink, Harmony.
- No, you don't.

320
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,694
We made an agreement.

321
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:02,560
I don't care. I need a drink
real bad. Just one.

322
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:06,297
- Let's go to the truck and make love.
- Harmony, I can't.

323
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,105
- Then let's leave.
- I need the money.

324
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,537
- And I need a drink.
- No, you don't.

325
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,012
Let me go.

326
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,879
Who the hell
do you think you are, anyway?

327
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,618
You ain't my daddy, ya know.

328
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,257
Linny Sue, bring me a beer, please.

329
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,258
Linny Sue, we'll watch "Bonanza"
after this.

330
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:52,040
Buford, I am Lois...

331
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:55,650
Lois Wheelis, your mother-in-law.

332
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,283
Now, Linny Sue is dead.

333
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:04,923
Well, we'll watch "Bonanza"
after this, Lois Wheelis.

334
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,493
Oh, Buford.

335
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,201
Bring me another beer, please.

336
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:16,729
Told ya, Orville, that Lawyer Pitman
didn't have that will.

337
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,276
I've done peed in my chili.

338
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,471
Daddy's mad at me
over Jimbo.

339
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:22,877
He's cut me clean out.

340
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,146
- Look what he done to you, Lurlene.
- I know.

341
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,709
Imagine your own daddy
cuttin' you out of a will

342
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,120
because the Lord called you
to the ministry.

343
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:37,258
Lurlene, how is it
that the Lord always calls on you

344
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,856
to do somethin',
'cause He ain't never said shit to me.

345
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,594
If you hadn't put Jimbo
in that home.

346
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,829
Hell, I had to do somethin'.

347
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:49,305
Marlene spoiled the boy rotten
till I couldn't do nothin' else with him.

348
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:53,936
He set fire to the back bedroom
smokin' marijuana cigarettes

349
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,845
and sniffin' gasoline.

350
00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:00,248
Daddy wanted to raise
that boy himself.

351
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:04,015
Like he coulda done any better.
Look what he raised.

352
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,643
- It's a pretty night, isn't it?
- It sure is.

353
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:37,218
Marlene, are you all right?

354
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:43,022
I miss my boy, Mama Wheelis.
I just miss my boy so much.

355
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:46,530
I know, honey. I know.

356
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,862
'Nother drink, please.

357
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,265
Hey, Sid.

358
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,741
Sorry I'm late, Sid.

359
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,480
Somethin' came up.

360
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:14,288
- Hey.
- What inspired you tonight, anyway?

361
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,988
Need a drinkin' buddy?

362
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,895
You know I do.

363
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,058
We do have customers,
ya know.

364
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,422
I cannot believe you!

365
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,123
You don't give
a flyin' flit about him, do you?

366
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,525
It's just his money.

367
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:28,088
This is your daddy, Orville...
your very own daddy.

368
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,031
Don't you care
anything about him?

369
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,968
Don't be upset, Sara Lee.
I didn't mean to make you upset.

370
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:01,361
Heavens to Betsy!
That hippie's playin' "I'll Fly Away."

371
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,100
I'll fly away

372
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:20,743
I'll fly away, oh, glory

373
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:26,883
I'll fly away in the mornin'

374
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:33,522
When I die,
hallelujah, by and by

375
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:41,164
I'll fly away

376
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,439
Take it, Mrs. Wheelis.

377
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:48,036
Just a few more weary days and then

378
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:51,513
I'll fly away

379
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:55,417
To a land where
joy shall never end

380
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:59,217
I'll fly away

381
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,817
I'll fly away, oh, glory

382
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:06,352
I'll fly away

383
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:10,197
When I die,
hallelujah, by and by

384
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:13,931
I'll fly away

385
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:17,964
Some glad mornin'
when this life is o'er

386
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,136
I'll fly away

387
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:25,171
To a home
on God's celestial shore

388
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,515
I'll fly away

389
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:32,147
I'll fly away, oh, glory

390
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,590
I'll fly away

391
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,823
When I die,
hallelujah, by and by

392
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,628
Oh, I'll fly away

393
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:50,135
I like it the way you kids
sing like that.

394
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:56,170
Daddy?

395
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:05,484
Where did Lita go?

396
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:10,823
But the time has come,
my darlin', to set things right

397
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:15,059
You'll be harder than my husband
to get along with

398
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:20,164
Harder than my husband every night

399
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:27,770
Harder than my husband,
harder than my husband

400
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:32,942
And I don't want our love affair
to end with a fight

401
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:38,913
You been like a little angel
how you love me

402
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:44,690
And I appreciate
the warmth of your embrace

403
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,500
I'll take that.

404
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,122
Paulena.

405
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:31,374
He's restin' easy.

406
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,812
Sounds like Sid's got himself
a new girl singer.

407
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:45,950
The Lord's gonna rain His judgment
on that place one of these days.

408
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,820
Mama Wheelis,
if you hate it so much,

409
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,090
why do you come out here
and listen to it?

410
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:58,067
In the hopes of a cool breeze.
Nothin' else, thank you very much.

411
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:07,074
- Sis, you wanna dance?
- Take a look at him.

412
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,772
Well, excuse me!

413
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:11,076
For wantin' a better life

414
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,780
No, Daddy, you can't blame me

415
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:21,048
For wantin' a better life

416
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:28,725
Summer sun'll bear on down
and burn you till you're blind

417
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:33,192
Winter wind cuts like a knife,
too much rain or shine

418
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:36,331
Daddy, you can't blame me

419
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:39,739
For wantin' a better life

420
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,076
Get your earplugs out.

421
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:06,531
Well, I could build me a house
right on down the road

422
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,968
That's far as I'd ever get

423
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,975
Far as I'd ever go

424
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:16,844
My mama died so young,
lovin' in the rocky ground

425
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:21,180
Well, Papa, I'll send money home
when I get me a job in town

426
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,619
Daddy, you can't blame me

427
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,822
For movin' away from here,
for wantin' a better life

428
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,416
Wantin' somethin' better than this

429
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:33,027
Daddy, you can't blame me

430
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,291
You can't blame me

431
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,492
You can't blame me,
you can't blame me

432
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,159
You can't blame me, Daddy

433
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,547
- That was bad.
- And gettin' worse.

434
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,817
We better go, Evalita.

435
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,698
Your father's been askin'
about you.

436
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,696
I think it's time
you deal with that.

437
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:47,760
Oh, yeah?

438
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,567
I think it's time you minded
your own God damn business.

439
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:58,982
I guess it is.

440
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:16,830
Good night, Daddy.

441
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,094
Hurry the hell up, Marlene.

442
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:49,029
I'm about to bust my bladder
out here.

443
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,434
- I'll be done in a second.
- Come on!

444
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:01,541
- Morning, Mrs. Wheelis.
- Mornin', Harmony.

445
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,405
Where's Evalita?

446
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,915
I don't know.

447
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,029
What's troublin' you, sonny boy?

448
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,964
My grandmother from Alabama
used to call me that.

449
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,798
Mema Rose.

450
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:32,071
Evalita didn't come home
last night, did she?

451
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,071
No, ma'am, she didn't.

452
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,547
- Like a cat in heat.
- Good mornin', Harmony.

453
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:39,708
Good mornin', Mama Wheelis.

454
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,513
- Mornin'.
- Mornin', Marlene.

455
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,053
- Did you sleep well?
- I did.

456
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,385
Thank you very much.

457
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,225
And guess what?!

458
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,865
This is just out of the blue,
but I bet you lost more weight.

459
00:38:55,933 --> 00:39:00,302
You noticed?
One and a quarter more LB's.

460
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,703
Good God, Marlene,
would you learn to strike a match?!

461
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:06,869
I think I singed my nose hairs!
Damn Herbalean!

462
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,606
It cleanses my system!

463
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,385
Marlene, honey,
why don't you set the table?

464
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:18,786
Yes, ma'am.

465
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,585
I'll help you.

466
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,171
I'm on Herbalean.
That's how I did it.

467
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:39,600
I don't know.

468
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:43,113
I don't think those radical diets
are all that good for you.

469
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:48,213
I seem to keep the same weight
just by eating healthy.

470
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,515
I don't drink anymore.

471
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,224
All I do now is smoke a little weed.

472
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,029
You smoke marijuana cigarettes?

473
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,860
Not often.
Just every once in a while.

474
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:07,301
Just one little vice.

475
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:12,809
I figure with a good diet,
a little wacky tobaccy won't hurt you.

476
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,907
Hey, I want you
to try something.

477
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:21,315
Ooh, I've always wanted to try
marijuana cigarettes.

478
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,615
No, it's not that.

479
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,382
One day, I was cleanin' out
my boy's room,

480
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:28,619
and I found this stuff
on the top shelf in the back of his closet.

481
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:31,820
So I took it down,
rolled it up and smoked it.

482
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,922
I got a little dizzy,
but not much happened.

483
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,593
Then I found a box of catnip.

484
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:40,193
I thought, "Why does this boy
have catnip... we don't have a cat?"

485
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,967
We have a dog... Bimbo's his name.
Jimbo's my boy, Bimbo's the dog.

486
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,532
Anyway, I found out
that I had smoked catnip.

487
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,544
I coulda killed that boy.

488
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:55,247
We gotta smoke
the real stuff later.

489
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:56,911
Try this.

490
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:59,319
No, thank you, Harmony.
That ain't on my diet.

491
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,790
No, it's, like, 35 calories each.

492
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,285
Okay. Thank you.

493
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:10,424
Good Lord,
this stuff tastes like Styrofoam.

494
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,594
It's better with
peanut butter and honey.

495
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,639
It'd have to be.
It's like eatin' an ice chest.

496
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,537
Lurlene, it's all yours.

497
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:20,736
Marlene stunk it up pretty bad,
but I opened up a window.

498
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,971
Fat ass!

499
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:26,073
- Watch it!
- Sorry, Mama Wheelis.

500
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:30,617
Looks like at her age,
she'd be hard of hearin', huh?

501
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:31,780
I heard that.

502
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,017
- Yeah.
- Boy howdy.

503
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:41,890
- I'm as hungry as a bear.
- And mean as a snake.

504
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:45,299
Don't start with me, woman,
'cause I ain't in the mood.

505
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:46,961
You never are.

506
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,734
I lost another pound and a quarter
this mornin', Orville.

507
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,799
Let's all stand up
and do the jig.

508
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,845
- Jealous?!
- Don't talk back to me, woman.

509
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,347
I'll slap the thunder outta you!

510
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:01,248
- Marlene, help me in the kitchen.
- She'll be right there.

511
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,115
Now listen, woman.

512
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,882
I don't know
what's gotten into you lately,

513
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:07,423
but I don't want you ever
to talk to me like that again.

514
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:09,118
You take your hands off me
right this second.

515
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,524
I'm takin' Phil Donahue's advice,

516
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,425
and I'm gonna stand up
for my rights as an equal partner

517
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:13,622
in this marriage.

518
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,028
Orville, let go of me.
You're hurtin' me.

519
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,123
Let go of me now!

520
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,193
- Marlene, help me scramble the eggs.
- I'm comin', Mama Wheelis.

521
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,001
I'm warnin' you, Orville.
I'm gettin' real tired.

522
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,543
Crazy woman.

523
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,246
Oh, shit.

524
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,809
Morning, Orville.

525
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,651
Did you sleep well?

526
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,124
What?

527
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:48,123
Yeah. Fine. Just fine.

528
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,859
Mama Wheelis,
don't cook me no breakfast.

529
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,731
Morning.

530
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:56,430
I have to go down to the bank
and get into Daddy's safe deposit box

531
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,338
and see if there's
a copy of that will

532
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,639
before Orville has a conniption fit.

533
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,702
Honey, you gotta eat breakfast.

534
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,748
It's the most important meal
of the day.

535
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,181
I heard that
on the "Hollywood Squares."

536
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,219
Who was it said that?

537
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,452
Oh, Lord!

538
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,358
So, Orville...

539
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,223
What?

540
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:23,061
What kind of work do you do?

541
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,294
I work for the city.

542
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,929
He dumps trash.

543
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,302
Would you shut the hell up,
Marlene?!

544
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,068
Jealous.

545
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:37,235
So you're a sanitation engineer,
so to speak.

546
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:40,715
- You gettin' smart with me, boy?
- Not at all.

547
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:44,185
For your information,
it's a damn important job.

548
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:46,882
This country'd be
a hell of a mess if it wasn't for us.

549
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,855
On top of that, you can find
some good stuff that you can keep.

550
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,725
It's amazing what people throw out.

551
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,198
I wasn't making fun of you.

552
00:43:56,266 --> 00:44:01,397
That's what we call 'em
in California... sanitation engineers.

553
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,236
Really? Sanitation engineers?

554
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,374
Yeah.

555
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,905
I kinda like the sound of that.

556
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,883
- Sanitation engineer, huh?
- Right.

557
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,714
Marlene, where's my coffee?

558
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:23,382
Sanitation engineer.

559
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:30,732
Ooh, you're gorgeous.

560
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,492
I am outta here.

561
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:36,333
- Mornin', everyone.
- Mornin', Lurlene.

562
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,735
Well, I hope I hadn't
cooked this breakfast...

563
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:43,177
everybody just flits off
without a bite.

564
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:47,047
You off to the bank,
Marlene on that crazy diet,

565
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,051
Evalita out alley-cattin',

566
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,952
the hippie friend
tankin' up on rice patties.

567
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:55,924
- Are you hungry, Lurlene?
- Yes, ma'am.

568
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:58,791
What do you mean,
Evalita's been out alley-cattin' around?

569
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:02,320
She didn't come home last night.
That's what Harmony said.

570
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:03,923
Never a dull moment.

571
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:08,097
You'd think after five husbands
and no tellin' how many in between,

572
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:09,571
that girl woulda had enough by now.

573
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:15,169
Well, she is an adult, so I guess
it doesn't concern us, does it?

574
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:19,705
Besides, doesn't it say in the Bible,
"Judge not lest ye be judged"?

575
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:24,382
Right. I'm gonna go fix Daddy
his breakfast.

576
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:28,784
Thank you, Lurlene.

577
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,121
Boy, this is good.

578
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:32,253
Breakfast is the most important
meal of the day.

579
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:35,457
Who was that that said that
on the "Hollywood Squares"?

580
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,692
- Oh, shit! Damn it!
- Watch it.

581
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,335
Lurlene, Harmony
was sittin' right out there.

582
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,432
He heard every word
you said about Evalita.

583
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,443
Oh, I had no idea!

584
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:49,911
Damn hippie queer...
serves him right.

585
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,614
I think he's a nice person,

586
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:56,710
and we all oughta try
to treat him like family.

587
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:59,278
Family?
Woman, are you outta your mind?

588
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:03,452
He's a damn hippie.
Probably a bisexual homo.

589
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,758
Well, he looks like
he's from outer space.

590
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,764
I think he's nice.

591
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:11,699
Bullshit. He's a damn
hippie pinko Commie...

592
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,737
I've just about
had enough of you.

593
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:16,739
- Why?
- Don't you talk back to me!

594
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:19,332
I'm gettin' sick and tired
of that mouth of yours.

595
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,104
You may be big,

596
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:24,272
but you ain't too big for me
to take my razor strap to you.

597
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:27,611
What the hell
are you laughin' at?

598
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,845
Hush up... all of ya!

599
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:33,120
There's a sick man in this house.

600
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,657
He may be dyin'.

601
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,286
You don't give a plug nickel.

602
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:41,559
So you all just hush up.
You're gettin' on my nerves.

603
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,532
Get to the table, all of ya.

604
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,933
You're gonna eat this breakfast
whether you want it or not.

605
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:49,837
I'm just gonna take Daddy his tray,
give him his medicine,

606
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,738
and I'll be right back
to eat my breakfast.

607
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,243
Thank you, Lurlene.

608
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:57,405
Lord, she's so sweet.

609
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,745
I believe if she hadn't been
a preacher's wife,

610
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,648
she'd have made a good nurse.

611
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:04,710
So much like Linny Sue.

612
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,869
Sara Lee, that's Clarence.

613
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:27,036
You go out there and tell him
horn honkin' is for callin' the cows.

614
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,476
Oh, my Lord!

615
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:35,280
Evalita's getting out of
his pickup... staggerin' drunk.

616
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,649
What?!

617
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:46,524
Time for breakfast.

618
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:51,696
Daddy?

619
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:56,203
Daddy!

620
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,320
<i>Dr. Kaufman, report to ICU.</i>

621
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,290
<i>Dr. Kaufman, ICU, please.</i>

622
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:19,862
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hello, pumpkin.

623
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:24,694
I wanna talk to all my kids.

624
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,068
I made a mistake.

625
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,175
I can't find my will.

626
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,673
I made a mistake.

627
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:39,107
He cut me out.

628
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:41,980
I just know
I've done peed in my chili.

629
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,686
Lita. Where's Lita?

630
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:57,366
I'm here, Daddy.

631
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,435
I'm here.

632
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:11,943
- I love you, Evalita.
- Well, I love you, Daddy.

633
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:17,783
- Sara Lee, where's Sara Lee?
- I'm here, Daddy.

634
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:21,317
I love you, Sara Lee.

635
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:24,986
Oh, Daddy, I love you, too.

636
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,825
Where's sister?

637
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,996
Yes, Daddy?

638
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:36,733
- I love you, sister.
- I love you so much, Daddy.

639
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:40,438
Orville.

640
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:50,250
- Orville...
- Daddy...

641
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,256
can you remember
where you put your will?

642
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:10,932
Look everywhere, Orville.
It could be anywhere.

643
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,844
I don't see no use.

644
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,708
He's mad at me.

645
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,886
I have done peed in my chili.

646
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:27,822
Will you shut the hell up
about peein' in your chili?!

647
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:29,688
It turns my stomach.

648
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,072
- Let me help you.
- Okay.

649
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,981
Sure you don't want to go with us?
We're just goin' for a little drive.

650
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:56,076
Oh, no, thank you.
I gotta get my beauty sleep.

651
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:58,815
It oughta take any day now.

652
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,416
- Very funny. Get in the car.
- All right, then.

653
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:14,292
Clean this up.
Mama Wheelis is back.

654
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:19,942
What in the cat hair
is goin' on here?!

655
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,979
- Nothin', Mama Wheelis.
- Hush up!

656
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:26,345
Now answer me.
What in the cat hair is goin' on?

657
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,043
Nothin', Mama Wheelis.

658
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:30,985
You broke
one of Linny Sue's cups.

659
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:33,147
You oughta be ashamed
of yourself.

660
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:34,952
- Sorry, Mama Wheelis.
- I'm sorry, too, Mama Wheelis,

661
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:36,925
but Orville broke that cup.

662
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:41,187
Orville pinched me.

663
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,494
You're looking for Daddy's will.

664
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,262
To get Daddy's affairs in order.

665
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:47,030
To get Daddy's affairs
in order, Mama Wheelis.

666
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,368
I don't have a prayer anyway,
'cause I done peed in my chili.

667
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,100
If you say that one more time...

668
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:54,769
What gives you two monkeys the right
to get Buford's affairs in order?

669
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:57,973
- We're his children.
- We're his children, Mama Wheelis.

670
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:00,278
Polly parrot.
Why don't you just keep quiet

671
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,341
if you ain't got
nothin' of your own to say?

672
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:07,322
I swear, if you two had a brain
between you, you'd be dangerous.

673
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:11,322
I want you to clean up this mess.

674
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:13,385
I don't want to see
a thing out of place.

675
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:17,263
I want you to glue
Linny Sue's cup back together.

676
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:20,498
Yes, Mama Wheelis.

677
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:23,869
What the hell
are you all laughin' at?

678
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,807
- Oh, nothin'.
- Oh, nothin' at all.

679
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,902
Whatever it was,
I must've missed it.

680
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,609
What's so funny?
Are y'all laughin' at us?

681
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:38,677
You two just look like you were kids
gettin' scolded, that's all.

682
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:42,782
It reminded me of that summer
we went to stay with Mama Wheelis,

683
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,292
and Orville dropped
his little red ball

684
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:47,159
down the hole of the outhouse.

685
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,755
- I don't think that's very funny.
- I don't, either.

686
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:54,770
Remember? He paid Evalita a nickel
if she'd go down there and get it.

687
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,898
And she got stuck, so Orville,
you had to go dig her out!

688
00:52:57,974 --> 00:52:59,669
I know the story.
I was there.

689
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:02,803
Yeah, I was there too,
and I didn't think it was real funny.

690
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:06,781
I never vomited so hard in my life.

691
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:11,116
There I was with the hose,
hosin' you down, both of you,

692
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:14,214
both of you buck naked
and covered with doo-doo

693
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:16,020
from head to toe.

694
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:21,158
Oh, my sides!
My sides are achin'!

695
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:35,469
I used to love to spend the summers
at Mama Wheelis'.

696
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,638
Oh, God, I hated those summers.

697
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:41,172
I was always the littlest, and y'all
would never let me play with you.

698
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:44,311
You know why we didn't
let you play with us, don't you, Evalita?

699
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,514
It was 'cause you was
a pain in the ass!

700
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:50,583
- Watch your mouth, Orville!
- They even say "ass" in the Bible.

701
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,595
You ain't in the Bible.
You're in Lowake.

702
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:57,497
Orville's right.
You were a pain in the ass.

703
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,865
You were a spoiled little brat.

704
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:02,029
Daddy just spoiled you rotten.

705
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:04,767
What are you gettin'
so fired up about?

706
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:07,309
That was when we was kids.

707
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:11,177
"Was," Evalita.
We ain't kids no more.

708
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:15,116
Don't you agree with me?
Ain't it time Evalita just grew up?

709
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:17,847
What are you talkin' about, girl?

710
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:21,186
You know damn well
what I'm talkin' about, girl.

711
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:24,557
Lord, I wish I had me
a roast to tend to. I don't.

712
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:27,927
You been rode hard, missy,
and many, many times,

713
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:29,693
and it's startin' to catch up with you.

714
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,997
Just look at that face.
You chisel off that makeup,

715
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:35,196
and you're lookin' at
nine miles of bad Texas road.

716
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,263
That's enough, Sara Lee.

717
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:40,309
- You're not Mama, Lurlene.
- I didn't say I was.

718
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,538
Just who the hell is it
you think you are anyway?

719
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,080
You think you can waltz in here
every five or ten years,

720
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:47,412
and take over the place
and boss everyone else around, huh?

721
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:48,576
No. l...

722
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:52,554
You're not Mama, Lurlene,
and don't you ever try to be.

723
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,987
I don't need to listen to this shit.

724
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:56,651
Oh, yes, you do,
'cause I'm not done with you yet.

725
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:59,354
The only thing you got
goin' for you, missy,

726
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,056
is that you're willin'.

727
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,224
You're willin' to bed flop
with anything that moves,

728
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,063
and I hate you for it.

729
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,000
That's enough, Sara Lee.

730
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,004
- More than enough.
- Shut up, Orville.

731
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:13,202
- You're vicious, Sara Lee.
- Yeah, well, I'm honest.

732
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:14,607
Like hell you are.

733
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:17,511
I got a question for you,
and I want an answer.

734
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:21,412
Did you spend the night
with Clarence last night?

735
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,748
- Oh, please!
- Shut up, Lurlene!

736
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,118
This is gettin' good.
Go ahead, Evalita, answer her.

737
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:27,713
Shut up, Orville!

738
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,925
Did you or did you not
spend the night

739
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,793
with my fiancé Clarence Hopkins
last night?

740
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:41,230
Well, you know Clarence,
and you know me.

741
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,807
So I guess you got your answer.

742
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:54,975
Now, if y'all will excuse me,

743
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:58,418
I'm goin' down to Bluebell's
to get drunk.

744
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,150
Might even get lucky again...
who knows?

745
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,626
You might've pulled the wool
over everybody else's eyes, girl,

746
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:11,224
but I been around this town, and I know
the truth about you and Clarence.

747
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,960
You little bitch!

748
00:56:15,065 --> 00:56:18,296
- I'm gonna snatch you baldheaded.
- Yeah, right.

749
00:56:18,368 --> 00:56:19,357
Where you goin', girl?

750
00:56:19,436 --> 00:56:22,030
I thought we were all
gonna try to get along.

751
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:26,503
Wait a dad-burn minute.
That's my car!

752
00:56:26,576 --> 00:56:29,773
I am gonna kick your ass
all the way to Odessa.

753
00:56:30,747 --> 00:56:32,112
Just leave me alone, Lurlene!

754
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:36,451
Sara Lee, please!

755
00:56:38,321 --> 00:56:40,289
Come on, it's my car!

756
00:56:46,696 --> 00:56:47,890
Damn crazy women.

757
00:57:12,622 --> 00:57:13,782
You bitch!

758
00:57:29,773 --> 00:57:31,741
She better not put a scratch
on my car.

759
00:57:31,808 --> 00:57:34,902
Orville, go to the pantry
and get the flashlight.

760
00:57:34,978 --> 00:57:38,175
There's somethin' in the stonehouse
I want you to help me with.

761
00:57:38,248 --> 00:57:39,374
Is it heavy?

762
00:57:39,449 --> 00:57:43,408
Move that fat bohunkus of yours
now before I take my switch to ya.

763
00:57:43,486 --> 00:57:45,317
- My back's been flarin' up.
- Get!

764
00:57:51,394 --> 00:57:54,261
I'm hungry for love

765
00:57:56,332 --> 00:57:59,665
Like a hobo for food

766
00:58:00,704 --> 00:58:03,867
Like a devil hunts for bad

767
00:58:05,408 --> 00:58:07,899
Like an angel looks for good

768
00:58:09,012 --> 00:58:12,971
I've been oh, so lonesome

769
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:17,745
Your letters ain't enough

770
00:58:18,988 --> 00:58:22,014
My... hey, just ignore her.

771
00:58:22,092 --> 00:58:24,083
I need to talk to you.

772
00:58:25,595 --> 00:58:26,857
Sure, baby.

773
00:58:29,332 --> 00:58:33,428
I tried so many times... tears, dear

774
00:58:33,536 --> 00:58:34,935
Sweetheart

775
00:58:42,112 --> 00:58:43,272
Here you go.

776
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:47,980
- I can do it myself.
- Suit yourself.

777
00:58:58,328 --> 00:59:01,263
How could you do it, Clarence?
How could you do this to me?

778
00:59:02,065 --> 00:59:03,464
Do what, baby?

779
00:59:05,735 --> 00:59:08,135
Just don't call me that, okay?

780
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,997
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

781
00:59:14,878 --> 00:59:18,678
Never mind.
You don't owe me any explanations.

782
00:59:25,588 --> 00:59:31,527
Clarence, I need a big favor,
for old times' sake, okay?

783
00:59:32,829 --> 00:59:34,091
Okay.

784
00:59:35,632 --> 00:59:37,065
What I need...

785
00:59:38,902 --> 00:59:40,164
I need...

786
00:59:41,771 --> 00:59:49,007
Well, I told my whole family
that me and you was gettin' married.

787
00:59:49,078 --> 00:59:51,012
I even bought
a fake engagement ring.

788
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,547
Ain't that funny?

789
00:59:52,615 --> 00:59:56,176
And they bought it, too...
hook, line and sinker.

790
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,685
And then this thing happened
with you and Evalita.

791
01:00:02,892 --> 01:00:05,952
Honey, nothin' happened
with me and Evalita.

792
01:00:06,029 --> 01:00:09,328
Oh, Clarence,
don't play dumb with me, okay?

793
01:00:09,399 --> 01:00:13,631
I just don't wanna eat crow,
especially not served by her.

794
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:23,334
Just don't sleep with her
anymore, okay?

795
01:00:23,413 --> 01:00:28,248
I mean, tell her she's too old
or she wasn't no good or something.

796
01:00:29,385 --> 01:00:31,910
Sara Lee, I never slept with her
in the first place.

797
01:00:31,988 --> 01:00:34,684
Clarence, that is two stories
I've heard now...

798
01:00:34,757 --> 01:00:37,123
one from you
and one from that Jezebel...

799
01:00:37,193 --> 01:00:39,354
and I sure as hell ain't gonna
place bets on who's lyin'

800
01:00:39,429 --> 01:00:41,056
and who's tellin' the truth.

801
01:00:42,398 --> 01:00:43,695
Lord!

802
01:00:45,602 --> 01:00:48,002
Oh, shit, that's Lurlene!

803
01:00:59,182 --> 01:01:00,410
Hey, sweet thing.

804
01:01:02,585 --> 01:01:04,075
Hey, over here, honey.

805
01:01:13,162 --> 01:01:14,993
Just don't, okay?

806
01:01:18,001 --> 01:01:20,595
Don't worry, baby.
Everything's gonna be all right.

807
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:22,934
Oh, God, Clarence,
I used to believe that.

808
01:01:23,006 --> 01:01:26,772
I really did.
But I don't anymore.

809
01:01:28,544 --> 01:01:29,909
I gotta go.

810
01:01:38,655 --> 01:01:44,389
Look, we tried awfully hard,
but I'm not gonna try anymore.

811
01:01:45,762 --> 01:01:48,595
And I'd appreciate it
if you didn't, either.

812
01:01:53,503 --> 01:01:55,061
I still love you, Sara Lee.

813
01:02:06,616 --> 01:02:08,948
I still love you, too, Clarence.

814
01:02:18,828 --> 01:02:22,594
So, my sister Vanitta and me
made these dresses.

815
01:02:22,665 --> 01:02:26,362
Hers was pink
and mine was lime green.

816
01:02:27,136 --> 01:02:28,603
All right.

817
01:02:33,443 --> 01:02:35,570
I don't think anybody's home.

818
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:41,378
- Hello, everybody. We're back!
- Cars are all gone.

819
01:02:47,323 --> 01:02:49,154
You don't suppose Buford died?

820
01:02:56,199 --> 01:02:59,965
- Hello. Turnover-Wheelis residence.
- Why don't you just say hello?

821
01:03:00,036 --> 01:03:01,503
Shut up!

822
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,972
Damn. That was some good shit.

823
01:03:11,614 --> 01:03:13,377
This is Marlene Turnover.

824
01:03:16,652 --> 01:03:19,849
I got a bad case of el munchos.

825
01:03:20,923 --> 01:03:22,151
Me, too.

826
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,492
Fine, Maybelline, just fine.

827
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:36,170
Maybelline, are you still fat?

828
01:03:39,876 --> 01:03:41,207
Yeah, well, I lost weight.

829
01:03:41,277 --> 01:03:43,802
"Why don't you look behind you
and you'll find it."

830
01:03:49,585 --> 01:03:53,112
I'm sorry, Maybelline.
Somebody's just makin' me laugh.

831
01:03:55,825 --> 01:03:57,053
It's Orville.

832
01:03:59,695 --> 01:04:02,186
Yeah, you know
what a cutup he is.

833
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:06,768
Yeah.
Shut up, Orville.

834
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:20,647
The number you have reached
is out of service at this time.

835
01:04:20,716 --> 01:04:22,946
Please check the number
and try again.

836
01:04:23,019 --> 01:04:24,680
This is a recording.

837
01:04:43,139 --> 01:04:45,004
Damn it, I said it was out of order!

838
01:04:58,888 --> 01:05:01,254
Damn, these rice things
ain't gonna cut it.

839
01:05:01,324 --> 01:05:02,518
I'm hungry.

840
01:05:06,462 --> 01:05:08,020
Damn, it's dark in here.

841
01:05:11,634 --> 01:05:13,158
It's in here somewhere.

842
01:05:15,104 --> 01:05:17,595
Could be a rattlesnake's nest in here.

843
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:21,608
Orville was datin'
ugly old Wilma Burns.

844
01:05:21,677 --> 01:05:24,237
She could bite a hog
through a picket fence.

845
01:05:24,313 --> 01:05:26,281
That's ugly.

846
01:05:26,349 --> 01:05:27,714
He wouldn't even give me
the time of day...

847
01:05:28,718 --> 01:05:31,619
...even though he was
as big as an old barn, too.

848
01:05:31,687 --> 01:05:36,852
Don't ask me why, Harmony,
but I had the biggest crush on him then.

849
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:43,162
Damn, the pie is good.

850
01:05:45,368 --> 01:05:49,031
So the band starts playin'
Chubby Checker's "The Twist,"

851
01:05:49,105 --> 01:05:51,266
and you should've seen
old Orville.

852
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:54,070
Do you want a sandwich
of this leftover pot roast?

853
01:05:54,143 --> 01:05:56,008
That'd be weird.

854
01:05:56,078 --> 01:06:02,347
So Orville starts twistin'
and shoutin' and shoutin' and twistin'.

855
01:06:02,418 --> 01:06:03,749
He twisted so hard,

856
01:06:03,819 --> 01:06:05,650
he split the seat
right out of his suit pants.

857
01:06:05,721 --> 01:06:08,246
He was so caught up in The Twist,
he didn't even notice it.

858
01:06:08,324 --> 01:06:09,348
Vanitta saw it first.

859
01:06:09,425 --> 01:06:11,325
When she pointed to Orville,
I about hit the floor...

860
01:06:11,394 --> 01:06:13,794
that big old butt of his
just hangin' out of them suit pants.

861
01:06:13,863 --> 01:06:15,558
He had a hole in his underwear.

862
01:06:15,631 --> 01:06:18,099
I laughed so hard
that I wet my pants.

863
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:19,828
You didn't.

864
01:06:20,803 --> 01:06:22,703
I sure as hell did.

865
01:06:22,772 --> 01:06:25,764
We had to leave the prom...
didn't get to dance one dance.

866
01:06:25,841 --> 01:06:27,069
You didn't?

867
01:06:27,143 --> 01:06:29,338
Vanitta was so mad at me...
she was drivin'.

868
01:06:30,813 --> 01:06:32,303
God, it was a sight.

869
01:06:32,381 --> 01:06:37,011
That big old hole in his underwear...
you could see his crack.

870
01:06:41,524 --> 01:06:44,721
Marlene, you are a funny woman.

871
01:06:44,794 --> 01:06:47,786
I never smoked
marijuana cigarettes before.

872
01:06:47,863 --> 01:06:50,161
It was a first for me.

873
01:06:51,767 --> 01:06:53,667
And a pretty woman.

874
01:06:53,736 --> 01:06:56,034
They make me talk too much,
though.

875
01:06:57,506 --> 01:06:59,235
They make me horny.

876
01:07:00,843 --> 01:07:02,242
Oh, my stars.

877
01:07:10,953 --> 01:07:13,285
I don't think
you oughta be doin' that.

878
01:07:14,557 --> 01:07:17,822
- Funny and pretty, huh?
- Centered.

879
01:07:17,893 --> 01:07:22,023
- Oh, goodness, and centered?
- And fun.

880
01:07:22,098 --> 01:07:24,828
I can't remember
when I've had so much fun.

881
01:07:29,038 --> 01:07:31,336
Harmony, I don't think you oughta do
this anymore, 'cause I'm gettin' a little...

882
01:07:31,407 --> 01:07:33,705
- Horny?
- Yeah.

883
01:07:33,776 --> 01:07:35,334
No! Confused.

884
01:07:39,448 --> 01:07:44,249
Harmony, I never had anybody
say them kind of things to me before.

885
01:07:52,995 --> 01:07:55,828
Stop, Harmony. We can't do this.
Somebody's gonna catch us.

886
01:07:58,034 --> 01:07:59,296
We can't...

887
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:12,670
Marlene, I think
I'm falling in love with you.

888
01:08:12,748 --> 01:08:15,774
What?! That's impossible.
It's them marijuana cigarettes.

889
01:08:15,851 --> 01:08:17,318
I don't know what I'm doin'.
You can't.

890
01:08:17,386 --> 01:08:20,844
I got a fat, mean husband
and a kid in reform school.

891
01:08:20,923 --> 01:08:22,515
I know.

892
01:08:23,092 --> 01:08:25,720
Harmony, don't do that now. Stop.

893
01:08:25,795 --> 01:08:28,787
- Run away with me, Marlene.
- I can't. Now you stop it.

894
01:08:28,864 --> 01:08:31,196
- I can't.
- Harmony, stop it. This ain't right.

895
01:08:31,267 --> 01:08:33,235
- It ain't right?
- No, it ain't right,

896
01:08:33,302 --> 01:08:34,701
and Harmony, it ain't moral.

897
01:08:35,638 --> 01:08:39,734
Somehow, I don't think
it's very right or very moral

898
01:08:39,809 --> 01:08:41,970
for you to be miserable
with that lousy son of a bitch

899
01:08:42,044 --> 01:08:45,536
- who treats you like shit.
- We had some good years.

900
01:08:45,614 --> 01:08:48,344
- You're unhappy, Marlene.
- What are you talkin' about? I'm happy.

901
01:08:48,417 --> 01:08:51,147
With me, tonight.

902
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:53,279
You've only been happy once
since you got here.

903
01:08:53,356 --> 01:08:55,950
That was with me.

904
01:08:56,025 --> 01:08:58,016
Stop it. Stop sayin' them things.

905
01:08:58,094 --> 01:09:00,119
Why? 'Cause they're true?

906
01:09:00,196 --> 01:09:04,189
No, they ain't true.
What about Evalita?

907
01:09:06,135 --> 01:09:10,367
What about her, Marlene?
Evalita doesn't love me.

908
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:12,600
Evalita doesn't know
what love is.

909
01:09:12,675 --> 01:09:18,580
I want a real woman,
an honest woman, a sincere woman,

910
01:09:18,647 --> 01:09:21,514
a woman capable of giving
and being loved.

911
01:09:21,584 --> 01:09:23,984
And that woman
is right in front of me.

912
01:09:26,188 --> 01:09:28,918
Oh, Harmony, the way you talk.

913
01:09:43,906 --> 01:09:45,203
That's it.

914
01:09:48,244 --> 01:09:51,304
Marlene, come here, pronto.

915
01:09:52,381 --> 01:09:55,009
Great pie. I wish I could bake
like Mama Wheelis.

916
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:02,789
Well, well.

917
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:06,421
Well, what do we have here?

918
01:10:07,997 --> 01:10:10,693
A hippie and a hippo.

919
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:13,794
We was hungry,
so we fixed a little snack.

920
01:10:13,869 --> 01:10:14,893
Little, my ass.

921
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:17,598
What happened to "get lean
with Herbalean," Marlene?

922
01:10:17,673 --> 01:10:21,074
- Great pie.
- Thank you, Harmony.

923
01:10:21,143 --> 01:10:23,543
- I can have one meal a day, Orville.
- One meal, my ass.

924
01:10:23,612 --> 01:10:24,738
Watch it!

925
01:10:24,814 --> 01:10:26,372
That's enough food
to feed an army.

926
01:10:26,449 --> 01:10:28,576
Harmony was eatin', too.

927
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,244
Yeah?

928
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:39,093
Great pie.

929
01:10:40,396 --> 01:10:41,988
- You're mean, Orville.
- I ain't mean.

930
01:10:42,064 --> 01:10:43,588
Puttin' my only boy
in reform school

931
01:10:43,666 --> 01:10:45,395
and always makin' fun of me...
you are too mean.

932
01:10:45,468 --> 01:10:46,696
I ain't mean.

933
01:10:49,004 --> 01:10:51,370
I'm just seein'
what's goin' on, that's all.

934
01:10:53,275 --> 01:10:56,108
And you leave Jimbo out of this.
I knew this wouldn't last.

935
01:10:56,178 --> 01:10:58,669
You're gonna blow up
bigger than Lulu on "Hee-Haw,"

936
01:10:58,747 --> 01:11:01,011
and once you start,
you can<i>'</i>t stop, and you know it.

937
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:03,074
Please shut up.
Just leave me alone.

938
01:11:03,152 --> 01:11:04,915
I can hear them hens
down at the beauty shop...

939
01:11:04,987 --> 01:11:06,978
"Oh, honey, look at Marlene.

940
01:11:07,056 --> 01:11:09,251
Lost all that weight,
and now, she's bigger than Dallas."

941
01:11:09,325 --> 01:11:12,158
- I can't wait.
- Oh, God, shut up!

942
01:11:12,228 --> 01:11:14,389
You know, Orville, you never have
a kind word to say to me...

943
01:11:14,463 --> 01:11:15,930
not one kind word.

944
01:11:16,932 --> 01:11:19,901
But you're gonna be sorry one day,
and it's gonna be too late.

945
01:11:25,374 --> 01:11:27,604
Where the hell you think
you're goin'?

946
01:11:27,676 --> 01:11:29,837
I'm goin' out.

947
01:11:36,852 --> 01:11:39,980
Orville, that was mean...
just real mean.

948
01:11:40,055 --> 01:11:42,489
Don't you tell me
how to talk to my own damn wife.

949
01:11:42,558 --> 01:11:44,526
I'm a grown man, Mama Wheelis.

950
01:11:52,234 --> 01:11:53,826
Let go of me!

951
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:57,567
I can manage very well
myself, thank you.

952
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,540
Fine, but if you throw up
on my leather seats,

953
01:11:59,608 --> 01:12:01,269
you'll clean every bit of it up.

954
01:12:01,644 --> 01:12:04,078
Hey, Lurlene, you know,

955
01:12:04,146 --> 01:12:08,708
there's somethin' I've been wantin'
to tell you for the longest time.

956
01:12:08,784 --> 01:12:12,413
You sing just like Mildred Keevner.

957
01:12:14,256 --> 01:12:19,421
Livin' on the dark side of life

958
01:12:19,495 --> 01:12:23,090
You don't know what's wrong
and what's right

959
01:12:23,165 --> 01:12:29,832
'Cause you're livin' on
the dark side of life

960
01:12:35,811 --> 01:12:37,904
- Marlene?
- What?

961
01:12:39,615 --> 01:12:42,379
What in the hell
are you doin' out here?

962
01:12:43,118 --> 01:12:44,107
Nothin'.

963
01:12:45,421 --> 01:12:47,184
Are you cryin'?

964
01:12:53,762 --> 01:12:55,593
What's wrong with you now?

965
01:12:57,499 --> 01:13:00,332
Nothin'. I'm depressed.

966
01:13:10,346 --> 01:13:11,438
I got just the thing.

967
01:13:11,513 --> 01:13:14,107
You know what I do
when I get depressed?

968
01:13:15,718 --> 01:13:20,155
Well, I sing Christmas carols...

969
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:24,123
because Christmas makes me happy.

970
01:13:32,234 --> 01:13:34,998
Jingle all the way

971
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:37,800
- Let me help you with that.
- Oh, yeah.

972
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:41,206
Just put it
on that table over there.

973
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:43,405
I been down on my back lately.

974
01:13:43,479 --> 01:13:46,277
So you think Daddy's will
is in that box?

975
01:13:46,348 --> 01:13:47,815
Mama Wheelis said it was.

976
01:13:50,052 --> 01:13:51,952
I'm back.

977
01:13:52,021 --> 01:13:55,650
Thank God you are all right.
I have been worried sick about you.

978
01:13:55,724 --> 01:13:57,191
Oh, I'm fine.

979
01:14:00,596 --> 01:14:02,791
What are you doin'
with Daddy's strongbox?

980
01:14:02,865 --> 01:14:05,197
Mama Wheelis
showed me where it was.

981
01:14:05,267 --> 01:14:08,031
She said the will's in it,
but we can't find the key.

982
01:14:08,103 --> 01:14:10,628
Mama Wheelis, why didn't you
say something to me about this?

983
01:14:10,706 --> 01:14:12,674
It had slipped my mind.

984
01:14:12,741 --> 01:14:15,107
Old people tend to forget.

985
01:14:15,177 --> 01:14:17,907
- Dashing through the snow
- What in the world?!

986
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:20,540
- In a one-horse open sleigh
- What now?

987
01:14:20,616 --> 01:14:24,780
O'er the fields we go,
laughing all the way

988
01:14:24,853 --> 01:14:29,187
Bells on bobtails ring,
making spirits bright

989
01:14:29,258 --> 01:14:33,752
What fun it is to laugh and sing
a sleighing song tonight

990
01:14:33,829 --> 01:14:35,490
Oh, jingle...

991
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,033
We're drunk.

992
01:14:41,437 --> 01:14:43,769
- No shit!
- Watch it.

993
01:14:46,241 --> 01:14:50,234
I ain't drunk.
I'm high on marijuana cigarettes.

994
01:14:50,312 --> 01:14:51,643
Oh, my Lord!

995
01:14:51,714 --> 01:14:53,841
You are lucky
you didn't get arrested.

996
01:14:55,451 --> 01:14:57,112
But I'll get drunk, too.

997
01:14:57,186 --> 01:14:58,983
No wonder our boy's
in reform school.

998
01:14:59,054 --> 01:15:00,988
I oughta beat
the livin' shit outta you.

999
01:15:01,056 --> 01:15:03,251
I tell you what you oughta do.

1000
01:15:03,325 --> 01:15:05,452
You oughta cram this
where the sun don't shine.

1001
01:15:05,527 --> 01:15:07,461
You put him there, Orville,
that's why he's there.

1002
01:15:07,529 --> 01:15:10,794
You just better watch it,
'cause I'm real tired of you.

1003
01:15:10,866 --> 01:15:12,663
There ain't no reasonin'
with a dope addict.

1004
01:15:12,735 --> 01:15:13,861
Give it to me.

1005
01:15:13,936 --> 01:15:15,198
I wanna give it to you,
all right.

1006
01:15:16,105 --> 01:15:17,231
Stop it now!

1007
01:15:20,609 --> 01:15:25,012
Here. I just wanted to see
how fast an asshole could move.

1008
01:15:26,048 --> 01:15:28,073
You bore the shit outta me, Orville.

1009
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:31,176
I'm washin' my hands
of this whole family.

1010
01:15:31,253 --> 01:15:33,585
I'm gonna get drunk now.

1011
01:15:34,623 --> 01:15:36,147
You don't need them beers.

1012
01:15:42,531 --> 01:15:47,195
Harmony, my very good friend,
would you like a beer?

1013
01:15:57,846 --> 01:16:02,283
Excuse me.
I didn't mean to do that.

1014
01:16:02,351 --> 01:16:03,750
Well, now...

1015
01:16:12,461 --> 01:16:14,156
Ain't this excitin'?

1016
01:16:16,365 --> 01:16:18,697
Sittin' around
listenin' to people burp,

1017
01:16:18,767 --> 01:16:21,759
watchin' a fool
tryin' to open a strongbox.

1018
01:16:21,837 --> 01:16:24,897
Maybe tonight, we can go downtown

1019
01:16:24,973 --> 01:16:28,966
and watch fireflies spin around
a streetlamp for entertainment.

1020
01:16:29,044 --> 01:16:32,844
No, Evalita. I'm sure you can
sniff out a honky-tonk or two,

1021
01:16:32,915 --> 01:16:34,405
if you just put your mind to it.

1022
01:16:36,218 --> 01:16:37,879
Be careful, Orville.

1023
01:16:42,991 --> 01:16:47,894
- Is the will in this box?
- That's what Mama Wheelis said.

1024
01:16:50,299 --> 01:16:51,789
I can open that box.

1025
01:16:51,867 --> 01:16:53,494
What?

1026
01:16:53,569 --> 01:16:56,595
He's sayin' he can open
Buford's strongbox.

1027
01:16:56,672 --> 01:16:59,163
I'll have it open in a second
with this crowbar.

1028
01:17:00,776 --> 01:17:02,971
Here, Harmony, open it.

1029
01:17:04,379 --> 01:17:06,813
I don't need that.
I need a hairpin.

1030
01:17:23,165 --> 01:17:24,860
You havin' a little trouble
there, Harmony?

1031
01:17:24,933 --> 01:17:26,457
Not at all.

1032
01:17:26,535 --> 01:17:29,368
Oh! That hippie's a crook.

1033
01:17:29,438 --> 01:17:32,464
I was, Mama Wheelis.
I did some time, too,

1034
01:17:32,541 --> 01:17:35,271
- for burglary.
- Oh, dear.

1035
01:17:35,344 --> 01:17:38,802
Lurlene, come help me
hide my jewelry.

1036
01:17:38,881 --> 01:17:41,145
And grab the cookie jar.

1037
01:17:42,484 --> 01:17:44,145
You don't have to hide your jewelry.

1038
01:17:44,219 --> 01:17:47,279
Harmony, I didn't know
you'd been in the pen.

1039
01:17:49,925 --> 01:17:51,586
Does that upset you?

1040
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:53,389
What the hell.
Let's just let bygone be bygones...

1041
01:17:53,462 --> 01:17:55,020
Yeah, it does.

1042
01:17:55,097 --> 01:17:57,122
Evalita, that third husband of yours...

1043
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:59,599
- Dave, Dale, Darrell...
- Darrell.

1044
01:17:59,668 --> 01:18:00,862
whatever the hell his name was...

1045
01:18:00,936 --> 01:18:03,427
went to the pen up in Huntsville
for writin' hot checks.

1046
01:18:03,505 --> 01:18:05,803
- I divorced him, didn't I?
- What the hell do you care?

1047
01:18:07,042 --> 01:18:09,169
Maybe Mama Wheelis is right.

1048
01:18:09,244 --> 01:18:13,078
I guess I just pick losers.

1049
01:18:14,283 --> 01:18:15,511
Excuse me.

1050
01:18:19,521 --> 01:18:24,083
Harmony, I'm sorry. I didn't...
I been drinkin'. I'm not myself!

1051
01:18:27,396 --> 01:18:32,834
Shit! I shouldn't have said that.
He's been good to me.

1052
01:18:32,901 --> 01:18:35,028
You treated him like dirt.

1053
01:18:35,103 --> 01:18:37,435
Y'all come around here.
Let's get this show on the road.

1054
01:18:37,506 --> 01:18:39,474
Mama Wheelis, he's gone.

1055
01:18:39,641 --> 01:18:41,336
I like that boy,

1056
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:44,345
but that diamond brooch
Daddy Wheelis gave me

1057
01:18:44,413 --> 01:18:46,438
is worth a fortune.

1058
01:18:46,515 --> 01:18:50,110
I hated that old goat,
but I loved that brooch.

1059
01:18:50,185 --> 01:18:53,052
He wouldn't have stole
your brooch, Mama Wheelis.

1060
01:18:55,757 --> 01:18:59,693
Oh, look. My baby shoes, bronzed.

1061
01:18:59,761 --> 01:19:02,355
He kept my second-grade
report card.

1062
01:19:02,431 --> 01:19:05,025
Look here. It's an arrowhead
I found and gave to Daddy

1063
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,000
on Father's Day
when I was real little.

1064
01:19:07,069 --> 01:19:09,401
Daddy's real sentimental, ain't he?

1065
01:19:09,471 --> 01:19:14,170
This is that news clippin'
about Linny Sue when she died.

1066
01:19:14,242 --> 01:19:16,142
Can we take a shortcut
down Memory Lane

1067
01:19:16,211 --> 01:19:18,179
and find the God damn will?

1068
01:19:18,246 --> 01:19:22,945
I was ready to tear up, Evalita.
Thanks for ruinin' my moment.

1069
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:30,417
Well, here it is.

1070
01:19:31,727 --> 01:19:33,490
I'm so nervous,
I can hardly stand it.

1071
01:19:33,562 --> 01:19:34,756
Give me it.

1072
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:37,924
Evalita, this ain't
the time for this.

1073
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:43,604
Okay, okay, it says,

1074
01:19:43,672 --> 01:19:46,573
Mama Wheelis and Sara Lee
get the house and...

1075
01:19:48,443 --> 01:19:49,933
I can't believe this.

1076
01:19:50,012 --> 01:19:53,641
It says Daddy's worth
over $600,000!

1077
01:19:53,715 --> 01:19:55,774
Oh, you read it, Sara Lee.

1078
01:19:55,851 --> 01:19:57,079
Out loud.

1079
01:19:58,186 --> 01:20:00,279
Y'all millionaires yet?

1080
01:20:00,355 --> 01:20:01,913
Come on, Sara Lee,
just read it.

1081
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:06,017
He said he made a mistake,
Lurlene.

1082
01:20:07,596 --> 01:20:09,928
I'm not in it, am I?

1083
01:20:14,269 --> 01:20:15,896
What about me?

1084
01:20:27,015 --> 01:20:29,074
I have done peed in my chili.

1085
01:20:29,151 --> 01:20:32,643
It's all right. I never expected
anything anyway.

1086
01:20:32,721 --> 01:20:34,712
Well, I did.

1087
01:20:36,925 --> 01:20:39,189
There goes the motorboat
you wanted.

1088
01:20:48,303 --> 01:20:50,771
What's so funny, Marlene?

1089
01:20:50,839 --> 01:20:55,799
He's divided everything among
Evalita and Sara Lee...

1090
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:05,142
...and he's crossed out Orville's name,
and written in Jimbo Turnover.

1091
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:08,451
He left my part
to that little sissy?!

1092
01:21:08,523 --> 01:21:14,723
That means you, me and Jimbo
get $200,000 each.

1093
01:21:15,831 --> 01:21:18,129
Now, he didn't leave me out.

1094
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,600
It says right here in number five:

1095
01:21:20,669 --> 01:21:26,107
"I leave my daughter Lurlene Sue
Turnover Rogers one dollar."

1096
01:21:26,174 --> 01:21:27,664
Anybody want a loan?

1097
01:21:29,611 --> 01:21:32,705
That means you'll get a dollar, too,
Orville, even though it don't say it,

1098
01:21:32,781 --> 01:21:35,909
'cause I believe it's the law.

1099
01:21:35,984 --> 01:21:37,849
A buck?

1100
01:21:37,919 --> 01:21:41,685
- This is just awful.
- One measly buck.

1101
01:21:41,756 --> 01:21:43,849
I'm just sick over it.

1102
01:21:43,925 --> 01:21:48,089
- One measly buck.
- I have an idea.

1103
01:21:48,163 --> 01:21:51,291
Since Evalita feels so awful
about this,

1104
01:21:51,366 --> 01:21:53,994
why don't she and Sara Lee
divide their part

1105
01:21:54,069 --> 01:21:56,594
- with Orville and Lurlene?
- It ain't that awful.

1106
01:21:56,671 --> 01:21:59,731
I'm willin' to give
some of mine away.

1107
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:03,539
I got expenses with my record and all.

1108
01:22:03,612 --> 01:22:05,773
I just don't think I can afford it.

1109
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:10,675
I been countin' on this.

1110
01:22:10,752 --> 01:22:14,347
Buford oughtn't have
left you a dime.

1111
01:22:14,422 --> 01:22:17,220
I tried my best
to talk him out of it.

1112
01:22:17,292 --> 01:22:19,192
You shut up, Mama Wheelis!

1113
01:22:19,261 --> 01:22:22,458
Don't you ever tell her
to shut up again,

1114
01:22:22,531 --> 01:22:25,967
or you'll be sprawled out on that floor
not knowin' what hit you.

1115
01:22:31,173 --> 01:22:34,836
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mama Wheelis.

1116
01:22:39,814 --> 01:22:43,773
Well, looky what
the cat drug up.

1117
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,914
- My daddy left me a bundle.
- Did he die?

1118
01:22:47,989 --> 01:22:51,516
No, not yet, but when he does,
we can make a whole album,

1119
01:22:51,593 --> 01:22:52,890
and you can produce it.

1120
01:22:52,961 --> 01:22:54,656
It's gonna be wonderful, baby.

1121
01:22:54,729 --> 01:22:56,162
I'm such a lucky woman.

1122
01:22:56,231 --> 01:23:02,329
I got you and I got my talent,
and I got all that money.

1123
01:23:02,404 --> 01:23:05,532
Baby, all you got is the money.

1124
01:23:05,607 --> 01:23:07,598
I dumped your things
out on the lawn.

1125
01:23:10,312 --> 01:23:12,303
I'm goin' back to California.

1126
01:23:14,382 --> 01:23:15,644
Here's your demo tape.

1127
01:23:15,717 --> 01:23:20,381
I'm sorry I called you a loser,
but I was drunk.

1128
01:23:20,455 --> 01:23:22,514
I'm sober now.

1129
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:25,024
I'm goin' with you, Harmony.

1130
01:23:25,093 --> 01:23:26,321
You what?

1131
01:23:26,394 --> 01:23:27,884
You what?!

1132
01:23:27,963 --> 01:23:31,262
He asked me to go with him,
so I'm goin'.

1133
01:23:31,333 --> 01:23:34,962
You're right, Harmony.
All I have is a fat, mean husband,

1134
01:23:35,036 --> 01:23:37,561
and a very rich kid
in reform school. I'm goin'.

1135
01:23:39,307 --> 01:23:42,037
- I've had just about enough lip.
- I'm sorry!

1136
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:46,139
I'm gonna teach you a lesson
once and for all!

1137
01:23:46,281 --> 01:23:49,250
The only way you're goin'
is over my dead body.

1138
01:23:49,317 --> 01:23:51,808
You have to sleep sometime.

1139
01:23:51,886 --> 01:23:52,875
Let her go now!

1140
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:17,468
Who gives a shit anyway?

1141
01:24:30,458 --> 01:24:32,949
It was nice meetin' you, Harmony.

1142
01:24:33,028 --> 01:24:35,496
Now, you keep on singin'.

1143
01:24:35,563 --> 01:24:38,623
- You've got a nice singin' voice.
- Thank you.

1144
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:42,898
- And be good to her.
- I will.

1145
01:24:44,706 --> 01:24:46,139
Bye, Lurlene.

1146
01:24:46,207 --> 01:24:49,370
Thanks for always bein'
so nice to me.

1147
01:24:49,444 --> 01:24:51,639
I'll be prayin' for you, Marlene.

1148
01:24:55,784 --> 01:24:59,151
Good-bye, Mama Wheelis.
I love you.

1149
01:25:00,555 --> 01:25:07,290
You be sure to write.
Box 95, Lowake, Texas, 76768.

1150
01:25:09,964 --> 01:25:11,693
Bye, Sara.

1151
01:25:11,766 --> 01:25:14,963
You take real good care
of yourself, okay?

1152
01:25:18,673 --> 01:25:22,109
I hope you and Clarence
get back together.

1153
01:25:26,047 --> 01:25:27,810
I hope you know what you're doin'.

1154
01:25:29,851 --> 01:25:32,843
This time, I think I do.

1155
01:25:37,859 --> 01:25:39,121
Bye.

1156
01:25:52,974 --> 01:25:54,566
- I'm sorry, Evalita.
- Shut up.

1157
01:25:57,512 --> 01:26:00,174
Just get outta here.

1158
01:26:02,684 --> 01:26:03,776
Trash.

1159
01:26:06,154 --> 01:26:07,746
I guess that's us.

1160
01:26:46,094 --> 01:26:47,959
I ain't goin' to the funeral.

1161
01:26:49,130 --> 01:26:52,497
If all he left me
was one measly buck,

1162
01:26:52,567 --> 01:26:53,966
then I ain't goin' to his funeral.

1163
01:26:54,035 --> 01:26:55,696
- Orville, please!
- I ain't goin'.

1164
01:26:55,770 --> 01:26:58,705
- You've got to go. It won't look right.
- I don't gotta do nothin'!

1165
01:26:58,773 --> 01:27:02,709
I already said I was gonna
split my part with you and Lurlene.

1166
01:27:02,777 --> 01:27:05,075
Then I'll go to your funeral.
I ain't goin' to his.

1167
01:27:05,146 --> 01:27:07,910
You gotta go
to your own daddy's funeral.

1168
01:27:13,021 --> 01:27:16,582
Marlene used to tie my tie.
I can't even tie my own damn tie.

1169
01:27:27,535 --> 01:27:30,800
- I never meant to hurt her.
- I know.

1170
01:27:36,578 --> 01:27:38,341
It's all right, Orville.

1171
01:27:40,448 --> 01:27:42,678
I tied it. It looks real good.

1172
01:27:44,018 --> 01:27:45,747
We love you, Orville.

1173
01:27:47,655 --> 01:27:50,215
Come on, now.
We got to practice this song.

1174
01:27:52,293 --> 01:27:53,351
I'm ready.

1175
01:27:53,428 --> 01:27:55,919
- Oh, dear!
- Oh, my Lord!

1176
01:27:59,267 --> 01:28:02,134
Evalita, we have to be
at Daddy's funeral in ten minutes.

1177
01:28:02,203 --> 01:28:05,331
- I'm ready.
- You can't go lookin' like that.

1178
01:28:05,406 --> 01:28:08,637
The hell I can't.
I can go any way I damn well please.

1179
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:12,544
Shows about as much respect
as that trashy mouth of yours.

1180
01:28:12,614 --> 01:28:15,640
I don't need to live my life
by the standards of Lowake, Texas.

1181
01:28:15,717 --> 01:28:18,777
You don't live your life
by any standards.

1182
01:28:18,853 --> 01:28:21,788
- I've had just about enough.
- It's about time.

1183
01:28:23,858 --> 01:28:26,053
If I'm performin',
I'm wearin' my stage clothes.

1184
01:28:26,127 --> 01:28:30,530
Evalita, this is the Baptist church,
not the Grand Ole Opry.

1185
01:28:30,598 --> 01:28:32,566
Minnie Pearl.

1186
01:28:32,634 --> 01:28:36,798
She's the one that said breakfast
is the most important meal of the day

1187
01:28:36,871 --> 01:28:38,270
on the "Hollywood Squares."

1188
01:28:38,339 --> 01:28:41,638
I ain't goin'.
I just now decided for sure.

1189
01:28:41,709 --> 01:28:43,734
Orville, we need your voice.

1190
01:28:43,811 --> 01:28:48,680
Buford wanted you to sing...
all of you... like you used to.

1191
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:52,208
We're goin' to sing his favorite,
"Precious Memories,"

1192
01:28:52,287 --> 01:28:55,313
just like when we were all kids.
It was his last request.

1193
01:28:55,390 --> 01:28:58,359
I'm singin' a solo.
I ain't singin' with y'all.

1194
01:28:58,426 --> 01:29:01,862
We're all singin' together.
The service is planned, Evalita.

1195
01:29:01,930 --> 01:29:04,922
You can count me out.
I don't sing with amateurs.

1196
01:29:04,999 --> 01:29:06,864
You oughta be ashamed
of yourself...

1197
01:29:06,935 --> 01:29:09,495
goin' to your own daddy's funeral
dressed like that.

1198
01:29:09,571 --> 01:29:11,004
Well, I ain't.

1199
01:29:11,072 --> 01:29:13,836
She's trash... pure D white trash.

1200
01:29:13,908 --> 01:29:17,844
Quite frankly, I'd be embarrassed
to be seen with you lookin' like that.

1201
01:29:17,912 --> 01:29:19,641
God!

1202
01:29:21,082 --> 01:29:22,344
It's...

1203
01:29:27,488 --> 01:29:29,547
I don't have anything else.

1204
01:29:31,993 --> 01:29:33,290
This is all I got.

1205
01:29:36,764 --> 01:29:38,732
Leave me alone!

1206
01:29:39,934 --> 01:29:41,060
I feel just awful.

1207
01:29:41,135 --> 01:29:45,367
Honey, I'd have been glad
to lend her a shawl or an apron.

1208
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,772
She ran upstairs
and slammed the door.

1209
01:29:47,842 --> 01:29:51,539
Why is it every time she's wrong,
we feel sorry?

1210
01:29:51,613 --> 01:29:52,739
I don't know.

1211
01:29:53,982 --> 01:29:55,847
We gotta practice this song.

1212
01:29:55,917 --> 01:29:59,409
All right, Mama Wheelis,
let's practice this song.

1213
01:29:59,487 --> 01:30:01,512
Are you going to help us?

1214
01:30:02,423 --> 01:30:03,788
Hell, no.

1215
01:30:03,858 --> 01:30:06,827
I guess then that Sara Lee,
Lurlene and me

1216
01:30:06,894 --> 01:30:08,657
will just have to sing a trio.

1217
01:30:08,730 --> 01:30:10,288
I'll sing alto.

1218
01:30:10,365 --> 01:30:12,697
I'll sing soprano.

1219
01:30:12,767 --> 01:30:15,702
I'll sing whatever
comes outta my mouth.

1220
01:30:24,012 --> 01:30:30,941
Precious memories,
unseen angels

1221
01:30:31,019 --> 01:30:37,686
Sent from somewhere to my soul

1222
01:30:37,759 --> 01:30:44,892
How they linger ever near me

1223
01:30:44,966 --> 01:30:51,496
How the sacred past unfolds

1224
01:30:51,572 --> 01:30:58,034
Precious memories,
how they linger

1225
01:30:58,112 --> 01:31:05,518
How they ever flood my soul

1226
01:31:05,586 --> 01:31:12,856
In the stillness of the midnight

1227
01:31:12,927 --> 01:31:16,988
Precious sacred scenes unfold

1228
01:31:17,065 --> 01:31:19,431
They unfold

1229
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:25,769
Precious father, loving mother

1230
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:30,539
Fly across the lonely years

1231
01:31:30,611 --> 01:31:33,136
Lonely years

1232
01:31:33,214 --> 01:31:40,052
And old home scenes
of my childhood

1233
01:31:40,121 --> 01:31:44,182
In fond memory appear

1234
01:31:44,258 --> 01:31:46,818
They appear

1235
01:31:46,894 --> 01:31:53,299
Precious memories,
how they linger

1236
01:31:53,367 --> 01:32:00,102
How they ever flood my soul

1237
01:32:00,174 --> 01:32:06,841
In the stillness of the midnight

1238
01:32:06,914 --> 01:32:11,112
Echoes from the past I hear

1239
01:32:11,185 --> 01:32:13,813
I hear

1240
01:32:13,888 --> 01:32:20,259
Old time singin',
gladness ringin'

1241
01:32:20,328 --> 01:32:24,788
From that lovely land somewhere

1242
01:32:24,866 --> 01:32:27,391
Land somewhere

1243
01:32:27,468 --> 01:32:34,135
Precious memories,
how they linger

1244
01:32:34,208 --> 01:32:41,114
How they ever flood my soul

1245
01:32:41,182 --> 01:32:47,382
In the stillness of the midnight...
