No. I have some emails to send.
Do you mind?

25
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:11,844
Hey, whatever you like.
Just don't stay up too late.

26
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:15,014
It's a big day tomorrow for you.
Fucking huge.

27
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:17,316
And you're gonna
absolutely smash it.

28
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,417
I'm gonna be making
more money than you.

29
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:22,722
Yes, you will, damn it.
Oh-oh. What a thought!

30
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:24,422
You bloody love it, don't you?

31
00:04:24,456 --> 00:04:27,392
Oh, I'm gonna make you
rue the day you hired me.

32
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:29,629
"Rue the day"?

33
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:31,063
That's very sexy.

34
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:34,767
Sure you don't want to send
those emails in the morning?

35
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,434
I'm sure.

36
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:38,004

- Thoroughly Magnificent Millie.
- [people chuckle]

42
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:35,261
I think that maybe comes close
to describing

43
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,562
our brilliant young
miracle-worker,

44
00:05:37,595 --> 00:05:41,167
a woman who has elevated
fund management to a sublime...

45
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,537
No, no, let me correct myself,
to a sacred level.

46
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,607
And our clients' faith in Millie
challenges religion itself.

47
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:52,044
It is a faith beyond faith.

48
00:05:52,078 --> 00:05:53,578
I hope I'm not being
too restrained.

49
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:56,248
People say I'm very grudging
with my praise.

50
00:05:56,282 --> 00:06:00,618
- [man] Absolutely.
- But it's over to you, magnificent one.

[Millie sighs]

52
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,493
Well, first, I'd like to thank
our esteemed leader

53
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:11,831
for his restrained
and grudging remarks.

54
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:15,468
- [people chuckle]
- Um, I've been incredibly lucky.

55
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,270
I'm lucky to have joined
this firm.

56
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:20,706
I'm lucky to have had you all
as my teammates.

57
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,709
And I am humbled,
truly humbled

58
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,645
to have you ask me to head up

59
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:30,282
this bold and inspiring
new initiative.

60
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:33,152
But...

61
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:36,789
I'm going to decline.

62
00:06:36,822 --> 00:06:38,623
[man] No.

63
00:06:38,657 --> 00:06:40,326
I'm saying no.

64
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:44,463
[woman]
Is she serious?

65
00:06:44,497 --> 00:06:45,563
Millie!

66
00:06:46,298 --> 00:06:47,800
What the hell are you doing?

67
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,535
Charlie, look,
it's not who I want to be.

68
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:52,838
- It's not who I am.
- Who do you think you are, then?

69
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:55,607
- That's for me to figure out.
- Please, let me suggest something.

70
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:56,776
It's not too late.

71
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:58,344
I can explain to Victor

72
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,012
you're having
a bad reaction to the pills.

73
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:01,981
- What pills?
- Anti-depressants or whatever.

74
00:07:02,014 --> 00:07:04,517
- I'm not depressed.
- The whole world's depressed.

75
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,253
- You must take something.
- You mean like vitamin pills?

76
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:09,789
One way or another, you're not
in a calm state of mind, Millie!

77
00:07:09,822 --> 00:07:13,292
Darling, let's just talk
about it at home, all right?

78
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:16,896
- Love you! [speaks indistinctly]
- [elevator bell dings]

79
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:18,731
[distant dog barking]

80
00:07:18,764 --> 00:07:21,400
[Millie] It's not
about us, Charlie.

81
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:23,702
I've never felt better about us.

82
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:29,108
There's just something I've
always wanted to do, that's all.

83
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:31,177
Which involves
throwing away your career?

84
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:33,578
I don't know.

85
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,982
What if I have just done
the most stupid thing

86
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:38,951
I ever possibly could've done?

87
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,722
Would it really make
that big a difference to you?

88
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:45,658
Would you still love me?

89
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,397
Well, it seems to me that,
without a job

90
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,166
or any real career prospects,

91
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,770
you'd probably have more time
available for creative sex.

92
00:07:57,803 --> 00:07:59,105
There you go.

93
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:02,274
Always looking
on the bright side.

94
00:08:05,077 --> 00:08:07,947
- Get you in some leather, a bit of S&M.
- [snickers]

95
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:11,584
By the way, what is it
you've always wanted to do?

96
00:08:13,886 --> 00:08:16,188
Later. I'm really tired.

97
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:21,260
- [grunts]
- [sighs]

98
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,899
Okay.

99
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:32,037
I've always wanted to be
an opera singer.

100
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,874
Wha...

101
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:39,111
What, you mean...
like in the shower?

102
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:44,650
Yeah, exactly. You got it in one.
Just like in the shower.

103
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:47,620
- [groans] I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
- No, don't worry about it.

104
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,355
I knew you'd understand.

105
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:51,190
Goodnight.

106
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:01,167
[Charlie sighs]

[musicians and singers
warming up]

108
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:20,753
- [woman] Come on, Tom.
- [crying]

109
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:23,689
Oh, sweetheart.
You can try again...

110
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:26,192
They're not gonna
take you seriously, Millie.

111
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:30,664
They'll look at you and say,
"It's not a calling, it's just a whim."

112
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,999
It's not just a whim.
I've always wanted to do this.

113
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:36,068
I've always wanted to sing.

114
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:37,870
I'm not going to spend
the rest of my life

115
00:09:37,903 --> 00:09:39,538
as a fund manager.

116
00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:41,140
You think opera singing

117
00:09:41,173 --> 00:09:43,008
is no more difficult
than fund management?

118
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,711
Well, I'm going to give myself
the year to find out.

119
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:47,846
- What, just to prove something?
- No.

120
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,683
It's not just to prove
a point.

121
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,251
It's... it's because
it's what I want to do.

122
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:53,619
And why shouldn't I?

123
00:09:53,653 --> 00:09:55,521
Why shouldn't
I follow my heart?

124
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,556
It normally takes years,

125
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,059
and people mostly start
a lot younger.

126
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:04,563
Patricia, I'm not that old
and it is not too late.

127
00:10:04,597 --> 00:10:07,233
I'm willing to do this
with or without your help.

128
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,339
Okay. If you want to take the fast
track, there is one way.

129
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:16,275
A competition,
like <i>Singer of Renown.</i>

130
00:10:16,308 --> 00:10:20,379
If you win, you land a role
with a major opera company.

131
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:24,016
But you're up against the sharpest
young singers in the country

132
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:25,818
at the peak of their form.

133
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:29,455
Okay.
Well, where do I start?

134
00:10:30,724 --> 00:10:34,628
Meghan Geoffrey-Bishop.
She's a little unorthodox.

135
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:36,730
Well, as long
as she gets results.

136
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:38,430
Oh, in her own way.

137
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:40,499
Most of her students
are now in psychiatric care,

138
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:43,535
but the ones who survived
became major stars.

139
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:46,640
- Uh...
- Just joking. Don't worry. You will love her.

140
00:10:46,673 --> 00:10:49,008
She's one of the sweetest people
you'll ever meet.

141
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,910
She's supposedly retired,
but who knows?

142
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:54,046
- I'll give her a call.
- Thank you.

143
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,418
You're gonna change my life.

144
00:11:01,553 --> 00:11:03,122
I hope not.

145
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:05,190

[singing continues]

148
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,185
Stop! What are you
trying to do?

149
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:35,254
This is one of the most
delightful arias ever written

150
00:11:35,287 --> 00:11:37,389
and you're turning it
into noise pollution!

151
00:11:37,423 --> 00:11:39,024
- I was...
- Shut up!

152
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,429
Start again, bar 32.

00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:46,899
- [jaunty music]
- [phone rings]

154
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:48,567
Shit!

155
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:54,708
What do you want?

156
00:11:54,741 --> 00:11:57,276
Hi. This is Millie Cantwell.

157
00:11:57,309 --> 00:11:59,945
Patricia Hartley said
she'd talk to you about me.

158
00:11:59,978 --> 00:12:03,750
- Who?
- My friend Patricia Hartley from the music conservatoire.

159
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:05,918
Did she call?

160
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:08,354
<i>I don't know. I don't remember.
What do you want?</i>

161
00:12:08,387 --> 00:12:10,956
Oh. Um, singing lessons.

162
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:12,692
[Meghan] Singing lessons?

163
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:14,993
<i>Uh, yes, I'd like
to study with you.</i>

164
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,629
I'm not taking on
any more students.

165
00:12:16,663 --> 00:12:18,832
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Please. Uh...</i>

166
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:21,333
Patricia said that you might be
able to make an exception for me

167
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:25,705
and she also said that although
your fees are very high,

168
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:27,906
<i>it would be worth
every penny.</i>

169
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:32,211
Oh? And how high
did she say my fees are?

170
00:12:32,244 --> 00:12:33,879
Oh, pretty high.

171
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,315
And how much
do the others charge?

172
00:12:36,348 --> 00:12:38,550
<i>As much as 100 a lesson.</i>

173
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:41,086
And I charge
quite a bit higher than that?

174
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,922
Yes, it seems so.
Quite a bit.

175
00:12:45,124 --> 00:12:47,025
All right, you can come
and audition.

176
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,796
<i>Oh! I... I have to audition
to be your student?</i>

177
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:52,064
[Meghan] Yes.
I don't take on lost causes.

178
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:54,634
Um, can I send you
a sound file?

179
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,935
What in God's name is that?

180
00:12:56,969 --> 00:12:58,937
You listen to it
on your computer.

181
00:12:58,971 --> 00:13:00,973
I don't have a computer.

182
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:04,109
- Oh. Um...
- Just a moment.

183
00:13:13,952 --> 00:13:18,725
Um, I can give you half an hour
this coming Saturday morning

184
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:20,760
at 8:15 sharp.

185
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:22,928
- 8:15 in the morning?
- <i>Yes.</i>

186
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:24,396
Don't be late.

187
00:13:33,907 --> 00:13:35,541
Why are you doing this?

188
00:13:35,574 --> 00:13:37,042
I can do what I like.

189
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:39,445
You're supposed to be retired.

190
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:41,346
It's supposed be just me.

191
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,315
Well, so far, Mr. Just You,

192
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:45,685
you've been on what I would
call a full scholarship.

193
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:48,587
I work for you.
I do everything you need.

194
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,289
Yes, but you're not
gonna get me a place

195
00:13:50,322 --> 00:13:51,858
in a five-star nursing home,
are you?

196
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:53,959
Or find the money to get
the fucking roof fixed.

197
00:13:53,992 --> 00:13:57,262
- I'll fix the fucking roof!
- No, you won't.

198
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,933
Stop fretting about it.
She won't pass the audition anyway.

199
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,669
- How do you know?
- Oh, grow up.

200
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,204
[pencil clatters]

201
00:14:05,237 --> 00:14:08,741
Max! Come back here!

[sirens wail]

207
00:14:46,612 --> 00:14:49,682
I had plans.
I was going to get us a puppy.

208
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:52,752
- A puppy? Really?
- Yeah.

209
00:14:52,785 --> 00:14:55,287
And I thought maybe we could
look for a house together

210
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,790
and the dog would have
a garden to play in and...

211
00:14:57,824 --> 00:15:01,460
We will.
Honey, we will.

212
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:03,328
Millie,
why are you doing this?

213
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:07,399
To yourself. To us.
Please, please, think again.

214
00:15:07,432 --> 00:15:10,402
- Talk to your therapist.
- I don't have a therapist.

215
00:15:11,336 --> 00:15:14,172
- What?
- I only pretended to have a therapist.

216
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,509
- Why?
- I don't know.

217
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:20,078
Because you like
complicated women,

218
00:15:20,112 --> 00:15:23,048
and I didn't want to seem
too plain and simple.

219
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:25,317
- But you are complicated.
- No, I'm not.

220
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:27,887
You mean
a genius fund manager

221
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:29,388

ahead of her

222

runs off to join the circus.

223
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:31,958
That's not complicated?

224
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:33,793
I'm not going
to join the circus.

225
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:36,328
I'm going to Drumbuchan to learn
how to be an opera singer.

226
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:37,563
- Drum-who?
- Drumbuchan.

227
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:39,298
It's in
the Scottish Highlands.

228
00:15:39,331 --> 00:15:41,000
Oh.

229
00:15:41,034 --> 00:15:44,037
Well, that makes the circus
seem quite rational.

230
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:48,273
Charlie,

231
00:15:48,307 --> 00:15:50,777
you are going to
raise your glass

232
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,713
and toast to my success.

233
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:55,715
Or go fuck yourself.

234
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,793

I'm gonna head over to work.

[music continues]

247
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:21,286
- What do you want done first?
- Upstairs.

248
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:23,790
The sink in
number two... disgusting.

249
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,368
Why? Are...

250
00:19:36,401 --> 00:19:38,905
- Are you full?
- No.

251
00:19:40,338 --> 00:19:42,541
It's just that
if I give you a room,

252
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:46,378
I've then got to give you
a guided tour of the amenities,

253
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:51,884
then turn your bed down and put one of
those after dinner mints on the pillow.

254
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:55,922
And in the morning,
I need to strip the bed,

255
00:19:55,955 --> 00:19:58,958
wash the sheets,
dry the sheets,

256
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,860
mop the floor,
clean the toilet,

257
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:02,762
and get one of those...
one of those

258
00:20:02,795 --> 00:20:05,497
"this toilet has
been sanitized" things

259
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,899
and put that in the bowl.

260
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:10,736
And for what?
For 45 pounds!

261
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:14,173
It's not really
worth the effort.

262
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:18,678
If things turn out,
I might stay a year.

263
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:20,079
What things?

264
00:20:20,112 --> 00:20:22,581
Do you know
Meghan Geoffrey-Bishop?

265
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:24,317
I'm afraid so.

266
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:27,119
I'm auditioning for her.
I'm hoping she'll train me.

267

[clattering]

268
00:20:31,623 --> 00:20:34,426
It needs
a new hot water tap.

269
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:39,431
- Max, get the lady's bags.
- What?

270
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:43,202
Get the lady's bags and
take them upstairs to her room.

271
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:47,707
- Her room?
- Yes, she's staying with us, Max, possibly for a whole year.

272
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,010
The bags!

273
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,580
[car alarm chirps]

274
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:00,585
The bridal suite.

275
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:02,822
I'm afraid it's all
we have at the moment.

276
00:21:13,498 --> 00:21:15,067
[Max] Training for anything
in particular?

277
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:17,535
Yeah. The <i>Singer</i>
<i>of Renown</i> competition.

278
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:18,771
- Have you heard of it?
- [thud]

279
00:21:18,804 --> 00:21:23,441
- [bags clatter]
- Uh... Uh...

280
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:35,021
I need to show you.

281
00:21:37,555 --> 00:21:40,860
Don't touch that tap. Okay?

282
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:44,730
Uh, okay, so there's only
cold water in the basin?

283
00:21:45,631 --> 00:21:49,601
- That would be correct.
- Does the hot water tap work in the bathtub?

284
00:21:49,635 --> 00:21:50,803
I don't know.

285
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:52,672
- Can I try?
- Okay.

286
00:21:55,573 --> 00:21:59,145
[pipes groan]

287
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,550
Satisfied?

288
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,853
Um... sure.

289
00:22:09,388 --> 00:22:11,523
Wait. Please.

290
00:22:12,425 --> 00:22:15,061
Here. Thanks.

291
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:34,579
Uh, would it be possible
to get something to eat?

292
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:40,019
Or perhaps
you could direct me

293
00:22:40,052 --> 00:22:43,689
to where I may be able
to find something to eat.

294
00:22:43,723 --> 00:22:47,625
No. This would be about
your only choice.

295
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,397
But we were planning on
closing the kitchen early.

296
00:22:52,865 --> 00:22:53,899
Oh.

297
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:57,569
I'll ask the chef.

298
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:10,883
What would you like?

299
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,021
Uh... Do you have any
local specialties?

300
00:23:15,054 --> 00:23:16,989
[laughs]

301
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:21,360
She'll have the special!

302
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:26,065
You're very fortunate,
you know.

303
00:23:26,098 --> 00:23:29,268
We're usually booked solid
on a Friday evening.

304
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:32,938
- So what happened tonight?
- Who knows?

305
00:23:32,972 --> 00:23:36,442
The winds of change,
I venture to say.

306
00:23:36,475 --> 00:23:40,846
The internet, social media.
Live streaming.

307
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,214
We don't know
who we are anymore.

308
00:23:42,782 --> 00:23:45,718
[liquid bubbles]

309
00:23:54,827 --> 00:23:55,895
You're from America.

310
00:23:57,663 --> 00:24:01,100
Yes. But I've
been living in London.

311
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:02,835
What did you do down there?

312
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:05,704
[Millie] Um... I was
in fund management.

313
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:10,109
Fund management.
How was that?

314
00:24:10,643 --> 00:24:12,144
Oh, I hated it.

315
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,579
Pay crap?

316
00:24:14,612 --> 00:24:16,415
No, no, the pay was great.

317
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:18,651
Was your boss a tosser?

318
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:22,555
No. Actually,
he became my boyfriend.

319
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:24,290
So if the pay was great

320
00:24:24,323 --> 00:24:26,559
and you were on cordial terms
with the management,

321
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:28,127
why did you hate it?

322
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,463
Uh...

323
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:33,399
It wasn't fulfilling.

324
00:24:40,406 --> 00:24:41,606
Oh!

325
00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:44,477
You're the chef
here as well.

326
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,712
Is that so difficult
to imagine?

327
00:24:48,347 --> 00:24:49,882
Sorry.

328
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:53,085
Is there a problem?

329
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,787
A problem?

330
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,621
Do you always answer
a question with a question?

331
00:24:56,655 --> 00:24:58,623
Why would I do that?

332
00:25:24,884 --> 00:25:27,186
This is really good.

333
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:29,054
Clever boy, our Max.

334
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:33,626
Hey, Ramsay, do you think
he'll make it this year?

335
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,929
You think he'll
break the curse?

336
00:25:36,962 --> 00:25:38,564
I don't know.

337
00:25:38,597 --> 00:25:41,667
I think he's up against
some stiff competition.

338
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:49,208
- [Millie] The Filthy Pig...
- [Charlie] <i>Are you serious?</i>

339
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:52,646
[giggles] Yes, The Filthy Pig,
that's what it's called.

340
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:54,680
It's the only pub
in the village.

341
00:25:54,713 --> 00:25:57,416
Or it kind of is the village,
as far as I can tell.

342
00:25:57,449 --> 00:25:59,151
<i>Is that really it?</i>

343
00:25:59,185 --> 00:26:02,254
Oh, no, apparently there's
a tractor repair shop

344
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:04,390
and a post office somewhere,

345
00:26:04,423 --> 00:26:06,692
but that's pretty much it.

346
00:26:06,725 --> 00:26:08,327
<i>Have you met
your teacher?</i>

347
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,229
No, I'm gonna meet her
tomorrow morning.

348
00:26:10,262 --> 00:26:11,564
<i>Where is she?</i>

349
00:26:11,597 --> 00:26:13,667
Just over the hill.

350
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:16,001
- <i>Well, good luck.</i>
- Hey, you never know.

351
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:19,338
Could be back tomorrow night
with my tail between my legs.

352
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,675
<i>I'm sorry about
the circus thing.</i>

353
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:22,708
Thank you.

354
00:26:22,741 --> 00:26:24,977
Okay, goodnight, honey.

355
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,745
- <i>Night.</i>
- Bye.

356
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:47,733
- [clears throat]
- Got a train to catch?

357
00:26:48,668 --> 00:26:49,902
Uh... no.

358
00:26:50,502 --> 00:26:51,837
So you were just
clearing your throat

359
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,505
in preparation
for this audition?

360
00:26:54,641 --> 00:26:57,509
Um... yes.

361
00:26:57,543 --> 00:26:59,044
Good.
That's a great relief.

362
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:00,779
Because I would absolutely
hate to think

363
00:27:00,813 --> 00:27:02,314
that you were impatient,

364
00:27:02,348 --> 00:27:05,251
and had an obnoxious
sense of entitlement

365
00:27:05,284 --> 00:27:07,519
which goes with
your overall appearance.

366
00:27:09,488 --> 00:27:11,023
Am I making you nervous?

367
00:27:12,224 --> 00:27:14,326
I said, am I
making you nervous!

368
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:15,861
Or are you deaf?

369
00:27:17,296 --> 00:27:22,067
- No.
- No, I'm not making you nervous, or no, you're not deaf?

370
00:27:22,835 --> 00:27:26,438
- I... I'm not deaf.
- So I am making you nervous?

371
00:27:26,472 --> 00:27:29,141
- Yes.
- Good.

372
00:27:29,174 --> 00:27:30,776
Then let's proceed.

373
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:32,878
Did you prepare something?

374
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,148
Y-Yes, I did.

375
00:27:36,181 --> 00:27:38,685
What is it?

376
00:27:38,718 --> 00:27:41,920
It's "Voi che sapete"
from The Marriage of Figaro.

377
00:27:42,821 --> 00:27:44,556
Okay, let's hear it.

378
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,924
Okay.

379
00:28:03,242 --> 00:28:05,244
[operatic music begins]

380
00:28:05,277 --> 00:28:07,479
[whispers] Holy Mary,
mother of God, pray for me now.

381
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,394
[sings in Italian]

382
00:28:41,347 --> 00:28:45,551
[pipes groan and thump]

383
00:28:56,128 --> 00:28:58,163
[clunking]

384
00:28:59,965 --> 00:29:02,034
Thank you.
That'll do.

385
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:04,671
Um...

386
00:29:07,906 --> 00:29:09,875
Well, that
was incredibly mature.

387
00:29:09,908 --> 00:29:13,245
That was so mature of you,
so unbelievably mature,

388
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:16,716
that I'm thinking of creating
a certificate of maturity,

389
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,417
a big one,
and getting it framed,

390
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:20,252
so I've got
something large and heavy

391
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:21,688
- to hit you around the head with.
- She's dreadful.

392
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:23,723
It'd be
a complete waste of time.

393
00:29:23,757 --> 00:29:26,291
- You know that.
- Oh, shut up, you idiot!

394
00:29:26,325 --> 00:29:29,629
Don't do it!
Don't lower yourself!

395
00:29:32,632 --> 00:29:34,299
You ruined my audition.

396
00:29:35,835 --> 00:29:37,603
Was the plumbing
really that urgent?

397
00:29:37,637 --> 00:29:39,104
Or did you just not
like my singing?

398
00:29:39,972 --> 00:29:42,174
Yeah.
You're a complete amateur.

399
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:43,777
She's not going to
accept you.

400
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:53,085
Really.
Don't take any notice.

401
00:30:03,663 --> 00:30:05,597
You are a sad excuse
for a singer.

402
00:30:05,632 --> 00:30:07,232
I could tell after
the first note.

403
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:09,401
You have one party piece,

404
00:30:09,903 --> 00:30:12,404
which is just
above karaoke standard,

405
00:30:13,138 --> 00:30:15,541
and you think you
really are something.

406
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:18,944
The person who sent you
owes me an apology.

407
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:21,346
- You owe me an apology.
- I'm sorry...

408
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,750
Shut up! I haven't quite
finished telling you

409
00:30:23,783 --> 00:30:25,718
how worthless you are,

410
00:30:25,752 --> 00:30:27,519
which is the first
thing you need to know

411
00:30:27,553 --> 00:30:29,087
when you become
one of my students.

412
00:30:31,056 --> 00:30:32,357
You're accepting me?

413
00:30:32,391 --> 00:30:34,794
I'm accepting you
as a challenge.

414
00:30:34,828 --> 00:30:37,563
The sort of challenge
it makes no sense to accept.

415
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:40,332
Why?
Because supposedly I'm mad.

416
00:30:40,365 --> 00:30:42,635
The Mad Diva of Drumbuchan.

417
00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:45,638
- Thank you.
- These are my rules.

418
00:30:45,672 --> 00:30:47,973
- No drugs...
- That won't be a problem.

419
00:30:48,006 --> 00:30:49,475
No alcohol.

420
00:30:49,508 --> 00:30:52,879
Um... uh, is that bad
for the vocal cords?

421
00:30:52,912 --> 00:30:57,349
No. It weakens the resistance
to distractions.

422
00:30:57,382 --> 00:30:59,351
But I'm staying in a pub.

423
00:30:59,384 --> 00:31:01,453
Yes, ironic, isn't it?

424
00:31:01,487 --> 00:31:04,924
And no visitors.
You can leave the past behind.

425
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:08,460
Including that bubble
of self-adoration you live in.

426
00:31:10,128 --> 00:31:13,031
Some people say
an opera singer needs to suffer.

427
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:15,567
And I shall
certainly make things

428
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:18,036
as unpleasant for you
as I can.

429
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,874
So maybe
you should get out now

430
00:31:20,907 --> 00:31:22,709
before it costs you anything.

431
00:31:25,712 --> 00:31:27,379
I think I'll stay.

432
00:31:28,213 --> 00:31:29,548
More fool you.

433
00:31:30,783 --> 00:31:32,952
What do you think of
Drumbuchan?

434
00:31:32,986 --> 00:31:34,787
Um, it's quite charming.

435
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:36,689
Really?
I can't stand it.

436
00:31:36,723 --> 00:31:38,590
Then why are you here?

437
00:31:38,624 --> 00:31:41,393
A woman came to me
after seeing my Tosca in '83

438
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:43,663
and said she'd
leave me her farmhouse.

439
00:31:43,696 --> 00:31:47,566
It was only once I got here that I
wondered if she'd actually liked my Tosca.

440
00:31:51,136 --> 00:31:53,673
- Any questions? No?
- Well...

441
00:31:53,706 --> 00:31:55,440
We'll start in the morning.

442
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:00,579
[door opens]

443
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:08,620
[man sings scales
in distance]

444
00:32:27,372 --> 00:32:29,341
[Meghan]
All right, get out.

445
00:32:32,912 --> 00:32:34,948
[door opens]

446
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:42,254
Are you ready?

447
00:32:42,287 --> 00:32:45,424
- Uh...
- He's my other student.

448
00:32:46,391 --> 00:32:48,828
He's very good.

449
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:50,596
Are you surprised?

450
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,398
- Well, I just...
- Yes, you are.

451
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:55,768
You're surprised that someone
like Max can sing like that,

452
00:32:55,802 --> 00:32:58,503
you condescending
little bitch.

453
00:32:58,537 --> 00:32:59,839
Come inside.

454
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:06,612
[plays descending notes]

455
00:33:08,547 --> 00:33:09,581
Do it.

456
00:33:12,184 --> 00:33:14,020
I... I can't.

457
00:33:15,054 --> 00:33:19,058
[plays notes]

458
00:33:19,092 --> 00:33:20,325
I said, do it.

459
00:33:23,696 --> 00:33:26,833
[sings poorly in Italian]

460
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:34,107
My God, you're even
worse than I thought.

461
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:37,977
Are you paying by check
or cash? I prefer cash.

462
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:42,949
- Mrs. Geoffrey-Bishop?
- Yes?

463
00:33:42,982 --> 00:33:46,251
I would like to enter the
<i>Singer of Renown</i> competition.

464
00:33:47,086 --> 00:33:50,023
- Oh, really?
- Can you prepare me for it?

465
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:55,828
- Yes.
- Well, now that you've heard how awful I am,

466
00:33:56,261 --> 00:33:57,496
how long do you
think it'll take?

467
00:33:58,463 --> 00:34:00,365
As long as you can afford.

468
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:06,271
Make it a double.

469
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:20,853
How do you know
all about Meghan's rules?

470
00:34:20,887 --> 00:34:25,424
You're in a place where there's
not really a great deal to know.

471
00:34:25,457 --> 00:34:27,426
I mean,
you must've noticed

472
00:34:27,459 --> 00:34:31,731
there's not really much happens
round here to tax the brain.

473
00:34:31,764 --> 00:34:34,133
So, therefore,
I can proudly claim

474
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:36,135
to know everything
there is to know.

475
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,038
Tell me about Max.

476
00:34:39,072 --> 00:34:42,041
Ah, now,
there's an exception.

477
00:34:42,075 --> 00:34:44,342
I don't know everything
there is to know about Max.

478
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:46,713
Nobody does.
Not even Max.

479
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:51,050
I'll tell you what
I think you want to know.

480
00:34:51,684 --> 00:34:56,089
He's been studying with
Meghan for about five years.

481
00:34:56,122 --> 00:35:00,425
He's twice tried to win the
<i>Singer of Renown</i> competition.

482
00:35:00,459 --> 00:35:02,527
This will be his last attempt.

483
00:35:04,697 --> 00:35:06,498
- Hello, Ramsay.
- Aye, aye.

484
00:35:07,332 --> 00:35:10,002
Just one more thing.

485
00:35:12,004 --> 00:35:13,706
Is Meghan just
taking my money,

486
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,908
knowing that I don't
have a chance?

487
00:35:16,743 --> 00:35:20,278
Well, you are sort of
the local economy right now.

488
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,982
All right, there, Jimi?

489
00:35:23,015 --> 00:35:24,650
Oh, Jimi, you look
terribly well.

490
00:35:24,684 --> 00:35:27,252
[vocalizing]

491
00:35:27,285 --> 00:35:29,354
Open your mouth. Open it.

492
00:35:29,387 --> 00:35:31,590
Wider, I said!
Wider, girl!

493
00:35:31,623 --> 00:35:35,260
Wider! Come on! La! La!
Where's your tongue?

494
00:35:35,293 --> 00:35:37,930
Stick it out. Stick it out.
Stick it out. Stick it out.

495
00:35:37,964 --> 00:35:41,566
Keep singing!
Keep singing!

496
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,669
Singing! La! Come on!

497
00:35:43,703 --> 00:35:45,604
- [continues singing]
- Sing! Sing!

498
00:35:45,638 --> 00:35:49,274
- Hi, darling. How's it going?
- [Millie] <i>Great. Great.</i>

499
00:35:49,307 --> 00:35:52,145
[with difficulty]
Is "rear-ry" exciting.

500
00:35:52,178 --> 00:35:54,412
You sound a bit strange.

501
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:55,748
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

502
00:35:55,782 --> 00:35:58,718
- "Abso-root-ree."
- <i>Okay.</i>

503
00:35:58,751 --> 00:36:01,687
- How are you, honey?
- <i>I'm doing fine.</i>

504
00:36:02,155 --> 00:36:03,790
Good. I, um...

505
00:36:03,823 --> 00:36:07,359
I can't talk "rong."
She might check my phone.

506
00:36:07,392 --> 00:36:09,561
- <i>Who?</i>
- Meghan, my teacher.

507
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,899
[struggles]
She has "rures."

508
00:36:12,932 --> 00:36:15,635
- She has what?
- <i>"Rures!"</i>

509
00:36:16,135 --> 00:36:20,106
[vocalizing]

510
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:22,175
[muffled notes]

511
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,926
What's that?

512
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:42,261
Warm salt water.

513
00:36:42,295 --> 00:36:43,996
Well, it's hot
at the moment,

514
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,765
but it should be warm
by the time you're upstairs.

515
00:36:45,798 --> 00:36:48,734
You gargle with it
as long as possible.

516
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,368
Two minutes or more.

517
00:36:50,402 --> 00:36:51,536
Don't swallow.

518
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,505
Should be okay in the morning.

519
00:36:56,242 --> 00:36:58,044
She's a fucking sadist.

520
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:02,048
It's a process.

521
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:05,584
I bet she hasn't had sex
in, like, 20 years.

522
00:37:06,219 --> 00:37:07,286
[Ramsay] Eight years.

523
00:37:15,161 --> 00:37:16,394
[Millie vocalizing]

524
00:37:16,428 --> 00:37:18,563
[shower runs]

525
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:24,837
[Millie vocalizing]

526
00:37:29,709 --> 00:37:32,611
[Millie sings fluttering runs]

527
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:54,300
You know, if you're going to
take the young woman's money,

528
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:56,369
you should at least
respect her efforts.

529
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:57,803
I mean, she can sing.

530
00:37:57,837 --> 00:37:59,672
What business is it of yours?

531
00:37:59,705 --> 00:38:01,774
Everything's my business!

532
00:38:01,807 --> 00:38:04,710
You're behaving
like an angry old diva.

533
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,880
It's as if you want to punish
the young woman

534
00:38:07,914 --> 00:38:09,749
because she could be
what you should have been.

535
00:38:09,782 --> 00:38:13,418
- Should have been? I was!
- And look at you now.

536
00:38:13,886 --> 00:38:17,422
A fallen idol,
with only people like me to admire you.

537
00:38:18,124 --> 00:38:20,192
Technically,
Ramsay MacFadyen,

538
00:38:20,226 --> 00:38:22,662
I know you have balls,
and they're not a pretty sight.

539
00:38:22,695 --> 00:38:24,664
But otherwise,
you lack the manhood

540
00:38:24,697 --> 00:38:26,399
to have a say about anything.

541
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:28,600
So how is it that you,

542
00:38:28,634 --> 00:38:31,137
the very model of failure
and downward mobility,

543
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,673
have come to give me advice?

544
00:38:33,706 --> 00:38:35,741
Or is it more admiration?

545
00:38:37,143 --> 00:38:41,147
- [car door slams]
- [engine starts]

546
00:38:47,386 --> 00:38:49,121
[Meghan] Don't think
of her as a rival.

547
00:38:50,222 --> 00:38:51,891
Maybe you should think of her
as the wind at your back,

548
00:38:51,924 --> 00:38:54,327
which is exactly what you need.

549
00:38:55,094 --> 00:38:57,396
Trouble is, I don't know if
she's got the backbone to last.

550
00:38:58,364 --> 00:39:00,232
Give me ten more slices.

551
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,234
God, how much
is she paying you?

552
00:39:03,402 --> 00:39:04,670
Let me make this clear.

553
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,105
Okay, I'm taking her money,

554
00:39:06,138 --> 00:39:07,807
but I'm not just
taking her money.

555
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,309
The girl might have potential.

556
00:39:10,343 --> 00:39:11,711
How much potential?

557
00:39:12,678 --> 00:39:14,146
I suppose we'll see.

558
00:39:16,548 --> 00:39:20,786
[sings competently in Italian]

559
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:29,195
[continues singing in Italian]

560
00:39:40,006 --> 00:39:43,042
Do you breathe through
your nose or your mouth?

561
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,813
- My mouth.
- Huh.

562
00:40:02,094 --> 00:40:04,497
- [Millie] Who is it?
- Max.

563
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:06,165
[Millie] Uh,
just a moment.

564
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:13,472
- Yes?
- If you decide

565
00:40:13,506 --> 00:40:14,840
you want to breathe through
your nose and your mouth,

566
00:40:14,874 --> 00:40:17,009
you should read
Rogers and Blum.

567
00:40:19,045 --> 00:40:21,579
Pfeiffer argues that breathing
should not be conscious and voluntary

568
00:40:21,613 --> 00:40:24,517
but unconscious
and involuntary.

569
00:40:24,549 --> 00:40:26,952
Um, would you like to
come in?

570
00:40:28,821 --> 00:40:30,489
Uh, no.

571
00:40:31,157 --> 00:40:33,259
There are different
schools of opinion.

572
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:35,127
Sing loudly before
you sing softly.

573
00:40:35,161 --> 00:40:36,762
Sing softly before
you sing loudly.

574
00:40:36,796 --> 00:40:38,998
Mouth should move.
Mouth should not move.

575
00:40:39,031 --> 00:40:41,834
Raise the palate,
don't raise the palate.

576
00:40:41,867 --> 00:40:44,236
Diction's vital.
Diction's crap.

577
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:47,840
It's all there.

578
00:40:48,908 --> 00:40:51,510
Um, thanks.

579
00:40:51,544 --> 00:40:54,246
[footsteps depart]

580
00:41:00,152 --> 00:41:02,455
So what's going on, pal?

581
00:41:02,488 --> 00:41:04,457
Give us
all the lurid details.

582
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,559
- What are you talking about?
- You and the girl.

583
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:09,628
- What's her name? Molly?
- Millie.

584
00:41:09,662 --> 00:41:11,097
There you are.

585
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,132
You've committed
her name to memory.

586
00:41:13,165 --> 00:41:14,633
Copulation
is sure to follow.

587
00:41:14,667 --> 00:41:17,169
They say it's good
for the vocal cords.

588
00:41:17,203 --> 00:41:18,904
- His or hers?
- Piss off.

589
00:41:20,873 --> 00:41:25,444
[Millie sings in Italian]

590
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:36,255
[mooing]

591
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:42,695
[Millie's singing continues]

592
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,664
Well, could be worse.

593
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:52,471
[Meghan] That young woman has shown more
determination in the last three months

594
00:41:52,505 --> 00:41:56,475
than you have in five years.

595
00:41:56,509 --> 00:41:59,512
The future for you as
I see it right now...

596
00:41:59,545 --> 00:42:02,081
and I may be doing you
a favor here...

597
00:42:02,114 --> 00:42:07,086
is a typical cruise ship
with regular burials at sea.

598
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,921
You'd do well on one of those,

599
00:42:08,954 --> 00:42:12,858
crooning your way around a bunch
of senile old deaf people

600
00:42:12,892 --> 00:42:15,261
who all have
one foot in the grave.

601
00:42:15,294 --> 00:42:17,163
Pull yourself together.

602
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:23,235
[operatic music]

603
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,618
Hello, Millie.

604
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,254
Oh, it's so nice
to hear from you.

605
00:42:42,288 --> 00:42:43,956
How's it all going?

606
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:47,426
Well, she has tried to kill me,
but not for a while,

607
00:42:47,459 --> 00:42:51,297
so I think there's a good
chance I might actually survive.

608
00:42:53,799 --> 00:42:55,167
[Meghan]
You've come a long way.

609
00:42:56,368 --> 00:42:58,137
I think you're ready for this.

610
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,674
- What is it?
- A composition by Mozart.

611
00:43:04,243 --> 00:43:06,011
Mozart wrote this?

612
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:08,347
Yes. Let's see what
you can do with it.

613
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:11,016
Couldn't I try something
a little more challenging?

614
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,885
Not for your
first performance.

615
00:43:12,918 --> 00:43:15,854
- As in public performance?
- Yes. In Edinburgh.

616
00:43:15,888 --> 00:43:17,256
At the Princess Royal Theatre.

617
00:43:17,923 --> 00:43:20,125
Don't you think we're
rushing things little a bit?

618
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,463
Yes, of course. But Edinburgh is
a qualifier for <i>Singer of Renown.</i>

619
00:43:24,496 --> 00:43:26,633
Now, do you want to
go for it or not?

620
00:43:31,403 --> 00:43:34,674
[simple classical music]

00:43:39,278 --> 00:43:41,547
[mumbling]

622
00:43:57,664 --> 00:43:58,964
Why are you jogging?

623
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:01,600
What?

624
00:44:01,635 --> 00:44:03,602
Why are you jogging?

625
00:44:03,637 --> 00:44:05,705
For my lungs, mostly.

626
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:07,273
Did Meghan
tell you to do that?

627
00:44:07,306 --> 00:44:09,174
No, my boyfriend
suggested it.

628
00:44:09,908 --> 00:44:11,543
You've got a boyfriend?

629
00:44:11,577 --> 00:44:12,646
Yes, I do.

630
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:14,213
Does Meghan know?

631
00:44:14,246 --> 00:44:16,615
I don't see what that
has to do with anything.

632
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:18,884
Is your boyfriend more
important than your career?

633
00:44:18,917 --> 00:44:20,720
My career as an opera singer?

634
00:44:20,754 --> 00:44:21,920
[scoffs]

635
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:25,291
Is this just an
interesting hobby for you?

636
00:44:25,324 --> 00:44:27,092
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

637
00:44:27,126 --> 00:44:29,094
Why is it
any of your business?

638
00:44:29,128 --> 00:44:32,998
- I'd like to help you.
- Help me? How?

639
00:44:33,633 --> 00:44:35,000
Well, for one thing,
too much jogging's

640
00:44:35,034 --> 00:44:36,935
not gonna do you any good.

641
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:39,271
I can show you some exercises
that will expand your lungs

642
00:44:39,305 --> 00:44:41,340
without damaging
the rest of your body.

643
00:44:41,373 --> 00:44:43,108
Max, why would you
want to help me?

644
00:44:43,142 --> 00:44:45,077
Because when you're at
the Edinburgh recital,

645
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:47,079
you'll be there as one
of Meghan's students.

646
00:44:47,112 --> 00:44:49,315
I don't want her being
publicly embarrassed.

647
00:44:50,883 --> 00:44:52,451
So then,
what would you suggest?

648
00:44:53,252 --> 00:44:56,121
- Come over to my place.
- Your place?

649
00:44:57,156 --> 00:44:59,091
I shouldn't be visiting guests
in their rooms.

650
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:01,160
I see.

651
00:45:15,307 --> 00:45:17,943
[Millie] Oh! Um, do you mean
on my bare skin?

652
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:22,147
- No, that won't be necessary.
- Oh. Okay.

653
00:45:24,751 --> 00:45:27,252
- Sing.
- Oh. [clears throat]

654
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:30,757

No, I still can't
feel anything.

660
00:45:52,044 --> 00:45:53,078
Put your hands on me.

661
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,419

[sings scale]

663
00:46:10,864 --> 00:46:13,867
Um, could you do that again?

664
00:46:16,368 --> 00:46:17,569
Yeah.

665
00:46:20,472 --> 00:46:21,940

667
00:46:34,821 --> 00:46:36,088
Can you feel the vibrations?

668
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:39,992
Um... yeah.

669
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,896
Do you think you can find
those vibrations?

670
00:46:44,697 --> 00:46:45,732
Mm-hm.

671
00:46:51,503 --> 00:46:54,006

[man] Oh, my goodness.
Here she is.

674
00:47:50,864 --> 00:47:53,733
Ah. Surprised to
see you again, Max.

675
00:47:53,766 --> 00:47:55,635
What keeps you coming back?

676
00:47:55,668 --> 00:47:57,637
It must be
the camaraderie.

677
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,873
[vocal warm-ups continue]

678
00:48:16,789 --> 00:48:18,691
Hey! What are you doing?

679
00:48:18,725 --> 00:48:21,093
Max, leave me alone.

680
00:48:21,126 --> 00:48:24,731
- What's happened?
- I've had an epiphany.

681
00:48:24,764 --> 00:48:26,331
Now is not the time
for epiphanies.

682
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:28,066
Oh, no,
now is the perfect time

683
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,969
because I can finally see
what's going on here.

684
00:48:30,003 --> 00:48:32,504
I am being set up to fail.

685
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:34,273
I'm not in the same
class as these people.

686
00:48:34,306 --> 00:48:36,709
I don't belong here,
except to entertain you all

687
00:48:36,743 --> 00:48:39,077
while I fall face-first
into the shit.

688
00:48:41,014 --> 00:48:43,650

Do what you like.

Ms. Emily Wheeler,
ladies and gentlemen.

692
00:49:45,845 --> 00:49:49,481
And next, we are pleased to
welcome back from Drumbuchan,

693
00:49:49,514 --> 00:49:51,985
Mr. Max Thistlewaite.

694
00:49:52,018 --> 00:49:55,554
Max is looking to qualify
for <i>Singer of Renown,</i>

695
00:49:55,587 --> 00:49:59,257
under the tutelage of

About Charlie being here.

about visitors and...

903

That's a very poetic
way of putting it.

904
01:08:57,130 --> 01:09:00,800
But I just mean gone,
as in "not here,"

905
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:03,770
as in "didn't turn up
for his work,"

906

as in "not to be found
at his usual place of abode."

Do you manage somehow to go
into a deep meditative trance

917

It sounds like she was like
a bit of a mother to you.

No, not really.

947
01:12:31,609 --> 01:12:34,413
The only mother I can remember
was Mother Superior,

948
01:12:34,447 --> 01:12:36,315
and she wasn't very motherly.

Why are you here?

951

Well, as you know,
I gave up

a very comfortable life
of white-collar crime

953
01:12:48,094 --> 01:12:49,395

And I think
I'm irresistibly attracted

01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:04,143
to the tragedy of it all.

01:13:04,176 --> 01:13:06,312
Every opera ends in death
and every love affair

960

by pain and betrayal.

961
01:13:08,214 --> 01:13:10,049
And it's just all
so dramatic.

962

every heroine in an opera

bring home to your mother.

01:20:19,378 --> 01:20:21,380
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.

1044
01:20:22,247 --> 01:20:25,584
- I didn't think I would come to pieces like this.
- You're not in pieces.

1045
01:20:26,185 --> 01:20:29,455
You are in one solid piece.
Okay?

1046
01:20:31,089 --> 01:20:32,659
- This is it.
- [applause]

1047
01:20:35,627 --> 01:20:38,163
You have to let go
of my hand. Okay?

1048
01:20:38,798 --> 01:20:39,998
It's okay.

1049
01:20:42,334 --> 01:20:44,671

Whoo!

1078
01:26:20,472 --> 01:26:23,109
My God. She could win.

1079
01:26:23,142 --> 01:26:24,609
Aye, she could at that.

1080
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:34,120
Max! What are you doing?

1081
01:26:34,452 --> 01:26:36,722
We promised we'd stay
away from each other.

1082
01:26:36,756 --> 01:26:39,491
Millie, please, there's
something I need to ask you.

1083
01:26:39,892 --> 01:26:42,094
Max, go away.
You're gonna be up soon.

1084
01:26:42,128 --> 01:26:45,164
- Now is not the time.
- No, now is the time.

1085
01:26:47,099 --> 01:26:48,333
Marry me.

1086
01:26:57,243 --> 01:26:59,278
I'm sorry. I need to pee.

1087
01:27:00,345 --> 01:27:02,614
- What did she say?
- She said she needed to pee.

1088
01:27:18,865 --> 01:27:21,200
- Is that what you've decided?
- Yes.

1089
01:27:25,171 --> 01:27:27,840
Will you tell him,
or would you like me to?

1090
01:27:27,874 --> 01:27:30,810
No! No. No.
Neither of us can tell him.

1091
01:27:30,843 --> 01:27:32,745
We can't tell him.

1092
01:27:32,778 --> 01:27:35,314
Just... Just please,

1093
01:27:35,348 --> 01:27:38,718
go out there and tell him
that I'm really feeling sick,

1094
01:27:38,751 --> 01:27:41,287
and that I am
completely overwhelmed.

1095
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:44,522
And I can barely talk
and just leave the ring here.

1096
01:27:44,556 --> 01:27:48,393
Tell him I'll see him later.
Just let him sing.

1097
01:27:48,426 --> 01:27:50,528
I'm sorry,
I can't lie to him.

1098
01:27:50,997 --> 01:27:52,397
What?

1099
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:55,234
I can't lie to him.
Can you?

1100
01:28:10,615 --> 01:28:12,318
What if this ruins
everything for him?

1101
01:28:13,719 --> 01:28:15,788
What if he falls to pieces?

1102
01:28:15,821 --> 01:28:17,657
All these years of
hard work and...

1103
01:28:19,892 --> 01:28:21,894
How can I live with that?

1104
01:28:21,928 --> 01:28:24,363
Do you intend
to marry him or not?

1105
01:28:26,866 --> 01:28:29,835
No, I don't.

1106
01:28:35,074 --> 01:28:37,276
Then he will
either sink or swim.

1107
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:44,417
[door closes]

1108
01:28:46,786 --> 01:28:48,688
You are the hero of the story.

1109
01:28:48,721 --> 01:28:50,823
You are Figaro,
the Barber of Seville.

1110
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:54,226
Men admire you.
Women adore you.

1111
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:56,696
And you sing ecstatically
of your accomplishments.

1112
01:28:57,595 --> 01:28:59,732
Your pride in who you are.

1113
01:28:59,765 --> 01:29:01,934
It is a song of joy if ever
there was one,

1114
01:29:01,968 --> 01:29:04,236
all you feel is
the wonder of the moment.

1115
01:29:06,806 --> 01:29:08,441
Max. Look at me.

1116
01:29:09,976 --> 01:29:11,543
You are a happy man.

1117
01:29:15,114 --> 01:29:16,382
Let's go.

[upbeat operatic music begins,

1119

of the waiter from the Filthy Pig.

[all applaud and cheer]

1125
01:31:24,609 --> 01:31:28,547
Hi. We just had to come and say
how very much we enjoyed it.

1126
01:31:28,581 --> 01:31:32,017
One word says it all.
Divine.

1127
01:31:32,051 --> 01:31:36,088
No, it was more than divine.
It was... <i>superbo.</i>

1128
01:31:36,122 --> 01:31:38,023
<i>Fantastico. Bravo.
Bravissimo.</i>

1129
01:31:38,057 --> 01:31:40,759
Hope this helps.
I can see how nervous you are.

1130
01:31:40,793 --> 01:31:43,829
Well, I don't stand
a chance. Never did.

1131
01:31:44,296 --> 01:31:46,398
I don't agree. If you didn't stand
a chance, you wouldn't be nervous.

1132
01:31:47,633 --> 01:31:50,503
Look, I've had an amazing year.
No regrets.

1133
01:31:50,536 --> 01:31:54,039
But it'll be good
to get back to reality.

1134
01:31:55,541 --> 01:31:57,309
That's a very healthy
thing to say.

1135
01:31:57,343 --> 01:31:58,911
I can see now why you
don't need a therapist.

1136
01:32:02,281 --> 01:32:03,983
- You're too kind.
- <i>Grazie.</i>

1137
01:32:13,259 --> 01:32:16,128
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am pleased to announce

1138
01:32:16,162 --> 01:32:17,997

high standard

of all the contestants
in this competition,

1140
01:32:20,766 --> 01:32:23,002
in addition to
the outright winner,

1141
01:32:23,035 --> 01:32:27,206

to also award a second prize.

1143
01:32:30,142 --> 01:32:33,812

- Thank you!
- Wonderful.

1146

Thank you so much.

1147
01:33:01,373 --> 01:33:04,310
And now the big moment.

1148
01:33:04,343 --> 01:33:08,981
The winner of this year's
<i>Singer of Renown</i> is...

1149
01:33:15,454 --> 01:33:17,556
Max Thistlewaite.

- [man] Well done, Max!

1153
01:33:34,039 --> 01:33:35,608
Well done. Excellent.

1154

[car beeps]

1162
01:34:32,131 --> 01:34:33,899
- Is that everything?
- Yeah.

1163
01:34:34,768 --> 01:34:36,670
Wow, it's weird to be back.

1164
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:45,144
[Charlie]
What are you thinking about?

1165
01:34:48,013 --> 01:34:49,749
I should have realized...

1166
01:34:50,616 --> 01:34:52,951
there's no fast track.

1167
01:34:52,985 --> 01:34:54,754
A year is nothing.

1168
01:34:56,922 --> 01:35:00,359
One might say I should've gotten
it out of my system by now,

1169
01:35:00,392 --> 01:35:02,061
but that hasn't happened,

1170
01:35:02,094 --> 01:35:05,397
and I don't think
it's going to happen.

1171
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:09,902
Charlie...

1172
01:35:11,970 --> 01:35:15,107
I don't think I'm going back
to reality as we know it.

1173
01:35:16,475 --> 01:35:18,010
I'm gonna keep studying,

1174
01:35:18,043 --> 01:35:20,913
and I am gonna keep
training my voice,

1175
01:35:20,946 --> 01:35:25,084
and I am gonna go back there one
day and win that damn contest.

1176
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:28,688
It's not over.

1177
01:35:29,723 --> 01:35:31,957

[Charlie clears throat]

1180
01:35:48,974 --> 01:35:50,342

1183
01:36:17,503 --> 01:36:19,538
- [Max] How sick is she?
- Way too sick.

1184
01:36:19,571 --> 01:36:22,675
- She's out of it.
- Well, who else is available?

1185
01:36:22,709 --> 01:36:24,811
We have a choice.
They're both here.

1186
01:36:24,844 --> 01:36:26,412
There's Alyssa Friedrichs,

1187
01:36:26,445 --> 01:36:29,214
bit of a cow, but she did this
at La Scala two seasons ago.

1188
01:36:29,248 --> 01:36:31,885
Then there's this new girl,
still cutting her teeth,

1189
01:36:31,917 --> 01:36:33,753
but already making
a name for herself.

1190
01:36:33,787 --> 01:36:36,121
- Right.
- Millie Cantwell.

1191
01:36:38,457 --> 01:36:40,526
I can have either of them
here this afternoon.

1192
01:36:41,927 --> 01:36:44,496
Uh... who would you go for?

1193
01:36:44,530 --> 01:36:46,598
Mmm... the cow.

1194
01:36:46,633 --> 01:36:48,567
Less interesting,
but safer choice.

1195
01:36:50,804 --> 01:36:52,004
Mmm.

1196
01:37:14,059 --> 01:37:15,728
How's your bladder control?

1197
01:37:17,196 --> 01:37:19,632
Much better, thank you.

1198
01:37:25,003 --> 01:37:27,841
I... I took back the ring
and they gave me a full refund.

1199
01:37:27,874 --> 01:37:29,776
Oh? Good.

1200
01:37:29,809 --> 01:37:32,879
Yeah, they said it happens
about one in every three cases.

1201
01:37:32,912 --> 01:37:34,848
That seems like a lot.

1202
01:37:34,881 --> 01:37:37,015
Mm. Yeah, well,
they're used to it.

1203
01:37:37,049 --> 01:37:40,118
They've had strongmen break
down in their store and cry.

1204
01:37:40,152 --> 01:37:41,955
I hope you didn't do that.

1205
01:37:46,926 --> 01:37:49,194
How are things
with your significant other?

1206
