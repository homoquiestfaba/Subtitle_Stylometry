1
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:46,039
25.000

2
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:33,360
Slow down Siham.
-If they want Bashu's wool...

3
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,080
...I will get all the money, right?
-Oh honey, you raised him.

4
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,439
What do I buy? I never
had money before.

5
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,159
Oh no, he doesn't
look well.

6
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:56,039
They told me, I'd find help here in Mecca.
-And you have.

7
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:01,360
Siham.
-Papa, where are you going?

8
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,000
We can't just leave. We have to
take care of this man first.

9
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,159
But what about Bashu?
-Remember what the Quran teaches...

10
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,479
...about charity Siham. For those who
give in charity men and women...

11
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:21,080
...and loan to Allah, a beautiful loan,
it shall be increased manifold.

12
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,759
If we don't live by that, well then we
are all not better than the people...

13
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,680
...who used to
rule this city.

14
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,560
You know Siham, Mecca
was a different place then.

15
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,800
Hundreds of idol gods
surrounded the Kaaba.

16
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,439
And for people who were poor like
myself, life was very difficult.

17
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,240
I thank you sir.

18
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,599
I'll take that.

19
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,199
When I loan money, I
expect to repaid back.

20
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,800
Please, I need it.
My family is hungry.

21
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,919
You should have
thought about before.

22
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,759
Get him!

23
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,600
Welcome to Mecca. You've
all travelled so far.

24
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,560
Remember, be generous in
your offerings. Very generous...

25
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,560
...and the gods
will bless you.

26
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,199
What?
- Oh great and holly lshizar...

27
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,199
...now l'm giving you
everything i owe.

28
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,240
You are pay to polish
not to pray Sumayya.

29
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,839
It is the pilgrimage season,
I want these gods to shine.

30
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,120
O Mecca! They lean his kindness
and our virtue is like...

31
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,319
...a flower in blue.

32
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,360
I paid you, now give
me the answer.

33
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,000
Patience Suhayl. The prophesy of
the divine arrows can not be rushed.

34
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,839
Well chosen Suhayl. Go ahead with
your scheme to cheat the sword maker.

35
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:34,720
For the arrow say, you won't get caught.
- Indeed.

36
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,160
Thief!

37
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,439
Ah, you have good
eye for slaves Umayya.

38
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,319
Please set me free, please.

39
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,759
I'll take him.
Bilal.

40
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,519
Remember this. They can whip
your body, but your soul is free.

41
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,040
It belongs to noone.

42
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,519
You, out of the way!

43
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:15,439
Throw them again boy. But remember,
loose, and you become my slave.

44
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,959
No!
-Come on.

45
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,920
Thank you.

46
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,800
Get up and
get out of here!

47
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,040
Look at all these people. The most
successful pilgrimage in years.

48
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,120
Good thing that gods
are here in Mecca.

49
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,120
Some of these pilgrims
are'nt too bright.

50
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,319
They are paying twice
what the goods are worth.

51
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,279
No, no. It's true. We have been stupid
not to raise the price on everything.

52
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,879
What has become
of our charity?

53
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,839
These pilgrims are on a
sacred journey to a holly place.

54
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:13,800
We use to take pride in supplying
water and shelter for the people.

55
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:20,839
Now it seems we pride ourselves in
taking advantage of their devotion.

56
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,600
I won't listen to this! -Ease Abu Jahl.
Abu Taalib is our leader.

57
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,959
Yes. And he is my brother. But that
doesn't mean I have to sit here...

58
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,439
...and listen to
false accusations.

59
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,199
The pilgrims are dry up and
glow away if it were not for us.

60
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,480
We were ten times
what we take.

61
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,920
He thinks he can lecture us just because
his clan takes care of the Kaaba.

62
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,319
We must change our ways.

63
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:55,480
Carefull Abu Taalib, change
can be dangerous.

64
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,920
Little did Abu Taalib know that the
nephew he raised, Muhammad (peace...

65
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,279
...and blessings be upon him ) was
about to change the world forever.

66
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,759
For at that time, at the age
of 40 he was climbing...

67
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,120
...toward a cave
outside the city.

68
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,800
To be alone,
to pray and ponder.

69
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,480
He was troubled by all
the injustice of Mecca.

70
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,000
Slavery, the mistreating of
women, greed, gambling...

71
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,319
...the sacrificing of babies...

72
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,360
...and the reliance on idol gods
made of wood and stone...

73
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,399
...proper one god of Abraham,
Moses and Jesus.

74
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,480
So as he did every year,
he came to the cave. Suddenly.

75
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:45,559
He was surrounded by light.
When he looked up...

76
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,639
...he saw the Archangel Gabriel
standing before him.

77
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,320
He was speechless.
''Read'' said the angel.

78
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,480
''I don't know how''
was the reply.

79
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,000
Gabriel repeated his command
three times. And each time...

80
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,559
...the reply was the same. And
then Gabriel taught him.

81
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,279
''Read in the name of your Lord the
creator. He created men...

82
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,320
...from a clotted blood. Read, your
Lord is the most bountiest...

83
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,879
...who taught to use of a pen. He has
taught men what he did not know.''

84
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,600
And then Gabriel vanished.

85
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,000
Muhammad, (piece and blessings
be upon him ) shocked with...

86
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,519
...fear and confusion. He stumbled out
of the cave and ran for home.

87
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,639
He doubted what he had seen. But
on his way down the mountain...

88
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:42,840
...Gabriel appeared again and said:
''Muhammad, you are the...

89
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,240
...Gabriel appeared again and said:
''Muhammad, you are the...

90
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,559
...Messenger of God
and I am Gabriel.''

91
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:54,559
He tried to turn away but no matter
where he look, Gabriel is there...

92
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:59,600
...repeating his message: ''Muhammad,
you are the Messenger of God...

93
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,080
...and I am Gabriel.''

94
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Once the angel was gone, Muhammad
(peace and blessings be upon him )...

95
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,480
...struggled for home.

96
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,039
When he finally arrived,
he was shivering.

97
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:19,879
He asked Khadija to cover him. He told
her everything he had seen and heard.

98
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,759
He told her he feared for his sanity or
that he had become possessed.

99
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,919
But Khadija assured him that God
would not allow evil spirit...

100
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,720
...to overtake a man like him.

101
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,639
Who had always told the truth,
cared for the poor and needy.

102
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,399
Soon after, Khadija went to
her cousin religious scholar...

103
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:43,279
...and told him
what it happened.

104
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,759
Your husband is a
Prophet of God.

105
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,840
The people will accuse him of
lying and many other evils...

106
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:02,200
...and he will be cast out.

107
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,480
Despite her cousin's warning, Khadija
believed all her husband had told her.

108
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,320
And she never hesitated in
becoming Islam's first believer.

109
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,519
And soon, others followed.

110
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,879
I keep hearing rumors about
Muhammad's secret meetings.

111
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,679
Please Abu Jahl.
- But he is teaching something. I don't...

112
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:31,919
...know what it is yet, but his adopted
son Zeyd has joined him and...

113
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:36,519
...so has his cousin Ali.
- So what? The rest are beggars...

114
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,039
...and slaves.
-But he must be punished!

115
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:43,519
For what?
- For teaching something different.

116
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:48,759
Look, if his followers were men of
power, if his teachings...

117
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:55,840
...were dangerous, I'd fall on him like an
ocean. But this is Muhammad...

118
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,919
...Abu Jahl, El-Emin,
the honest one.

119
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,200
For three years the Prophet (peace
and blessings be upon him )...

120
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,799
...preached in secret.

121
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:13,639
It was during this time Siham,
that i first heard his teachings.

122
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,360
I am not sure we should be doing this.
- You have to hear him mother.

123
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,639
We'll be allright Celile.

124
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:26,159
Insight, quickly. There is more tonight
than ever before. - Thank you Cafer.

125
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:39,440
Where do you go every night?
- To hear a Prophet of God.

126
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:44,159
What a feeling to learn
the way of Islam from...

127
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:47,879
...God's Messenger (peace and
blessings be upon him ).

128
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,159
His revelations, the Quran, offer the
most beautiful words we had ever heard.

129
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:02,039
He taught us all the gods of Mecca are
powerless. There is only one god.

130
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:08,799
The god of Abraham, Moses and Jesus.
You have to surrender everything to him.

131
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,879
There is no such thing as rich or slave
in the eyes of God. All are equal.

132
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:20,279
And the poor aren't to be put down
and despised, there to be cared for.

133
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,759
The Quran says, in the name of God
the merciful, the compassionate.

134
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,600
The most honored of you in the sight of
Allah, is the most dratious of you.

135
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,879
Woman are'nt possessions. They are
God's creations and just as important...

136
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,320
...as any man.
Respect them.

137
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,960
The earth is a gift from God.
Treat it gently.

138
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,159
You are it's caretaker. And
remember you will all be judged...

139
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,600
...according to your deeds.

140
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,399
Many became
muslims that night.

141
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,360
We showed our faith
with a simple pledge.

142
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,159
There is no god but God and
Muhammad is his Prophet.

143
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,879
There is no god but God...

144
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,080
...and Muhammad
is his Prophet.

145
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,279
No god but Allah...

146
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,399
...and Muhammad
is his Prophet.

147
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,399
You won't believe it Amal. He
says all man are created equal...

148
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,159
...in the sight of God.
- You have to take me to him.

149
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,399
I knew you would see the danger
of Muhammad's preaching.

150
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,799
Of course i see it.
He must be stopped.

151
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,279
You can not stop Muhammad.
-What?

152
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,399
Bilal come back you will be whipped.
- They can whip my body...

153
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,360
...but not my soul.
-Fine than leave your soul there...

154
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,240
...but get your body back here.
-What do you know about Muhammad?

155
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:59,919
I know he is a prophet. -Prophet?
You see, it spreads like a disease.

156
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,120
The gods will punish for
those words Bilal.

157
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,799
Muhammad says the idol gods
are powerless. -Powerless?

158
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,360
Powerless he says. A slave
says all the gods are powerless.

159
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,879
Now, what do all of you say about
Muhammad's harmless teachings?

160
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,759
Our nephew preaches
against us Abu Taalib?

161
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:29,799
We also believe in an allmighty God.
-Well yes. But we don't say all the rest...

162
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,240
...are worthless.
- What harm can be done by it?

163
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,240
Those who listen to him
are te poor and weak.

164
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,000
Not all. They have been
joined by Abu Bakr.

165
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,759
Oh yes! Muhammad's mighty
friend has also deserted us.

166
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:57,759
He is only one man.
- No! He is the first spark of a flame...

167
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:02,399
...that must be extinguished.
- Yes.

168
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,200
If Muhammad's preaching becomes
popular and our gods are abolished...

169
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,159
...there will be no pilgrims.
And if there are no pilgrims...

170
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,320
There will be no more us.

171
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,759
The Messenger of God has
sounded a warning call.

172
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,519
What? Is Mecca under attack?
-I don't know, come on.

173
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:34,240
Sumayya come to the Kaaba, hurry.
-Yasir quickly, come.

174
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,519
What's going on?
-I don't know.

175
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,639
There he is.
-Up you go.

176
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,960
You see the Messenger of God Huda?
-There!

177
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,000
He's about to speak.

178
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,480
And then The Prophet (peace and
blessings be upon him ) said:

179
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,039
'' O people of Mecca. If I told you there
is an army behind the hill come to...

180
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,559
...invade us, would you believe me?
-We would believe anything from...

181
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,599
...you Muhammad.
- You've always spoken the truth.

182
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:15,720
And so he continued: '' O people of
Mecca I beg you, abandon your gods...

183
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:22,119
...and worship the one and only God.
Save your self from the fire of hell...

184
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,839
...for I can not keep you from God's
punishments. I am only like the man...

185
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,480
...who sees the enemy coming and goes
to warn his people of the approaching...

186
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,559
...danger in order
to save them. ''

187
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:40,119
Our nephew is making a fool of us.
Stop him Abu Taalib.

188
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,680
Boo to you Muhammad!
Have you assembled us for this?

189
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:48,039
We believe Muhammad!

190
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,839
Is'nt it wonderfull?
- Do you believe this man?

191
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,119
Oh yes, every word.

192
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,799
He is leaving the hill.
Let's go join him.

193
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,359
How dare you betray Mecca?
-The gods are'nt good enough for you?

194
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,440
We will protect you
Messsenger of God.

195
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,160
How dare, insult the gods!
-Prophet?

196
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:16,279
Block arms, don't let
them hurt the Prophet.

197
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,799
Stay together.
Don't let them through.

198
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:26,440
You can not do this Bilal.
-If the Messenger of God no longer...

199
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,480
...preaches in secret,
I will not follow in secret.

200
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,839
What is this?

201
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,319
No, don't tell me. My slave
has become a muslim.

202
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,880
You may own my body, but my soul...
-Let me guess. You think your soul...

203
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,279
...is free.
- No my soul is also a slave, but...

204
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,160
...not to you. To God.
-That's where your wrong Bilal!

205
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:04,480
It all belongs to me. Everything you are,
everything you think, everything!

206
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:11,680
Say it! Deny Muhammad's words and
say your soul belongs to me!

207
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:14,200
Say it Bilal
say it.

208
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:20,079
There is only one God and
Muhammad is his Prophet.

209
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,880
Let's see what you'll
say under the lash.

210
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,640
They desevre it.
- Yes he does!

211
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:33,200
Deny Muhammad's words.

212
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,440
Bilal.

213
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,599
One God.

214
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,000
One God.

215
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:54,640
Say I am the owner of your soul
and I remove the stone.

216
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Say it.

217
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:00,240
Punish him!

218
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,599
One God...
- Say it!

219
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:12,079
Umaya. I come on behalf of Abu Bakr.
He wants to buy this man from you.

220
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:18,960
Name your price.
- Allright. 10 gold pieces.

221
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,839
You think you've won
something don't you?

222
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:45,440
You tell Abu Bakr I would have taken 3
pieces of gold for that worthless soul.

223
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,920
He would have pay 100.

224
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,359
Despite the beatings Muhammad
continues to preach and make...

225
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,440
...convertes of our pilgrims. How?
- The answer is simple.

226
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:11,319
It lies on the Quran.
- What? His, so called revelations.

227
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,119
They are nothing more
than idle babblings.

228
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:21,279
All due respect Abu Cahal Muhammad's
revelations are neither idle nor bablings.

229
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:28,359
They are powerfull, simple. Not
of this world. - Magic?

230
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,279
lt's the only
reasonable explanation.

231
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:38,480
Well than, we must stop him from
using his magic poetry against us.

232
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,960
Abu Taalib we have the
greatest respect for you.

233
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,400
But time and again we have pleaded with
you to stop your nephew's preaching.

234
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:53,480
You have done nothing.
- He is threatening the peace in Mecca.

235
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:59,200
A few years ago he brought peace in
Mecca. You praised his wisdom then...

236
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:03,799
...Abu Cahal. Remember when the
Kaaba was being rebuilt. We were...

237
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,759
...about to kill each other for the right to
place the black stone.

238
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,640
But Muhammad came and...
-The point is this!

239
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,720
Abu Jahl.
- Stop him or someone else will.

240
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,160
Out! Do you want bloodshed and
fighting among Quraysh? Out now!

241
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:27,119
You can see my situation Abu Taalib. lt's
getting more and more difficult to keep...

242
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,279
...the peace. Please
talk with your nephew.

243
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:38,000
For the peace of Mecca,
l will talk to him.

244
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,440
Muhammad, close the
door and come in.

245
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,440
Please sit.

246
00:22:54,839 --> 00:23:01,720
Son of my brother, Quraysh demand that
you stop your preaching. lf you don't...

247
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:08,079
...l fear l can not protect you.
l am an old man Muhammad.

248
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,279
l can not fright these people. My
own neighbours, my own tribe.

249
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,440
People, we have
known all our lives.

250
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,119
ls what you preach so
important Muhammad...

251
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,240
...that you and l
must die for it?

252
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,960
That there must be
bloodshed in this city?

253
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,559
For the peace of Mecca,
stop your preaching.

254
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,279
This made Muhammad (peace and
blessings be upon him ) very sad.

255
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:48,720
But he answered saying: '' lf they put the
sun in my right hand and the moon...

256
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:54,799
...in my left, l will not stop what l am
doing. l will continue until either...

257
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,839
the word of God prevails,
or l perish in the process.

258
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:12,119
Muhammad. Say and do what you
please, this uncle will never...

259
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,400
...abandon you. Not now,
not as long as l live.

260
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:27,240
l say we are Muhammad's clan and we
will stand by him and protect him.

261
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,960
No matter what the cost.
- Why?

262
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:34,400
Why must we become the enemy
of Mecca for one man?

263
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:40,000
Because he is our nephew and
because he has done nothing wrong.

264
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,640
The great Hamza speaks. Good thing
you are swift with the sword brother.

265
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,319
Because Muhammad is
forcing you to use it.

266
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,960
l am not dying for him just because
he says he saw an angel!

267
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:05,440
Muhammad continues to preach despite
all we do to him and his followers.

268
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,680
Please stop him before
he ruines everything.

269
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,559
He is coming.

270
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,920
He is praying.

271
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,559
Infidel!

272
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,640
l won't let you
overthrow our gods!

273
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,839
Here it is!

274
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,720
How dare you walk away!

275
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,799
Oh Hamza you're back.
- What is it?

276
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,160
Abu Jahl insulted your nephew. He said
a horrible thing in front of the whole city.

277
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:02,039
What did my nephew do?
- Nothing, he just walked away.

278
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,640
He tried pray here just this morning.
But l thrown him away.

279
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,680
Hamz...

280
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:14,839
If you want to fight someone
fight me you coward.

281
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,759
How dare you insult Muhammad when
l too am of his religion. - No.

282
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:29,720
l did'nt know you followed Muhammad.
- l do now.

283
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,759
Do what you must.

284
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:46,920
l know what you teach is true nephew.
l feel it in every word you've spoken.

285
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,559
That's why l can say this.
There is no god but Allah...

286
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,319
...and you are his Prophet.

287
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:08,400
Punish them.
- This way.

288
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:12,240
Where are you taking her?

289
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,039
Stop! Let her go.

290
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,359
Where is my husband?
- Nevermind that.

291
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,400
Deny Muhammad and confess
the gods or die! Do it.

292
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,160
No, no.
- Do it!

293
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:40,119
Say it mother. Tell them
what they want to hear.

294
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,119
Listen to your
son Sumayya.

295
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:50,519
Tell me truthfully would you deny
God and his Prophet just to live?

296
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,160
l...

297
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,720
And neither will l.

298
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,039
There is only one God,
and Muhammad is his Prophet.

299
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:06,759
Do you mug me? Than those
words shall be your last!

300
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:10,720
No!

301
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,759
The first martrys of Islam.

302
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:28,519
Poor Sumayya, poor Yoosuf.
- Thank God Ammar lives.

303
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,160
How is he?
- The prophet is doing all he can...

304
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:37,200
...to ease his pain. But he fears for our
lives. And says that those who can...

305
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,480
...should go to Abyssinia.
- Abyssinia?

306
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:47,119
lt's ruled by a christian king, a kind man
who might allow us to live there.

307
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,720
And l've been asked to lead the group. l
need some strong man to help me.

308
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:56,519
Go Malik, we'll be fine.

309
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,759
We better keep going. We have got
a lot of ground to cover before...

310
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,640
...they find out we're gone.

311
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,079
They could be in Abyssinia by now.
- Tell Halit to take some man and...

312
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,000
...go after them. They must be brought
back and punished so all will know...

313
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,039
...that rebellion will not
be tolerated in Mecca.

314
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,480
Here lies my most precious
neckless, it is yours.

315
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:30,759
Now bless me
for my generosity.

316
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:39,319
Well, excellent work. - l understand
you know the Abyssinian king.

317
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,160
l do, quite well as a matter of fact.
- Good. This is for him.

318
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,720
You will get your share if you can
convince him to turn the muslims...

319
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:56,240
...over to us.
- If anyone can do it, it is l.

320
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,480
lt's good to see you again Amr.
- All these gifts are for you.

321
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:14,240
Your generosity is overwhelming.
- You deserve much more.

322
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:19,000
l understand you are concerned about
this few who have emigrated...

323
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,440
...from your city.
- Rebels sir. They started up trouble...

324
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:28,720
...in our city and they will do the same
in yours. Let us do the favour of...

325
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:34,200
...taking them from you.
- They seem peacable enough to me.

326
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:39,279
They have created a new religion
which means to destroy all others.

327
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,720
How you answer?
- Dear king...

328
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:47,480
Bow to the king!
- We bow to no man sir, only to our God.

329
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,759
You see dear king,
anarchy allready.

330
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,079
l let it pass. l am
more concerned...

331
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,400
...about their attitude before God
than before me. Continue.

332
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:09,680
Not very long ago, dear king, we
were people living in ignorance.

333
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:16,279
Than God has sent us a Prophet.
He called us to worship one God...

334
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:22,920
...and to always tell the truth. He asked
us to love and care for our parents.

335
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:29,039
To help our neighbours and give to the
needy. He taught us that our time...

336
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:35,279
...here is brief. And everything
around us is a trust from God.

337
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:41,680
The earth, our bodies, we must take
care of them and we will stand...

338
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:46,319
...before God in a coming day
and answer for our deeds.

339
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:53,359
What they teach Amr is
the Gospel of Jesus.

340
00:32:53,559 --> 00:33:00,519
No dear king. They do not respect
your religion. They say that...

341
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:05,599
...Jesus is not the son
of God but merely a man.

342
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:11,720
Of Jesus, we say what our Prophet said
to us that he is the servant of God...

343
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,559
...his messenger, his
word and his spirit...

344
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,880
...which he cast upon
Mary the Blessed Virgin.

345
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,000
What we believe
and what you believe...

346
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:29,759
...are like these
two beams of light.

347
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,880
Separate, yet coming
from the same source.

348
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,000
l would not give you up
for a mountain of gold.

349
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,759
You may live here
as long as you like.

350
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:53,359
As for you Amr, take your
gifts and return to Mecca.

351
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,079
Abu Jahl.

352
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,119
Abu Jahl.

353
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,159
Couple of reach pilgrims thought that
they can out gamble Abu Lahab...

354
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,920
...won everything they had.

355
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:22,079
lt was'nt you two
l beat was it?

356
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:26,159
Abu Jahl's nephew Omar lbn
El Hattar has joined the muslims.

357
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,280
Omar? My...the great...my Omar?

358
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,800
Yes, Omar yes!
- No, not Omar.

359
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:40,239
lt seems he heard the Quran. The
beauty of it cleaned his heart he said.

360
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,480
l know just what to do.

361
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:48,800
Hear me holly gods!

362
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,719
We can't do anything to stop the
muslims, maybe you can help.

363
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,320
Oh shut up you drunken fool.
- Spread them with plague.

364
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:04,960
Would you ple... That's it.
You've solved it. - l did?

365
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:09,039
We'll threat them like outcasts.
Cut them off from everything.

366
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,159
Great. Then they'll leave here and
spread their lies throuhg all of Arabia.

367
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,519
We won't let them go anywhere. We'll
keep them right here and watch them...

368
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:25,119
...starve. - Starve? How?
- We will sign an agreement and...

369
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:30,119
...hang it in the Kaaba. lt will say that
noone shall sell or buy anything...

370
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,559
...from Muhammad's followers or those
who protect him. No one shall mary...

371
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:40,320
...them, no one shall assist them in
anyway. They will be as outcasts...

372
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,559
...to all of Mecca until Muhammad
sees the error of his ways.

373
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,360
Thank you Muhammad.

374
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,440
The muslims were cut off. Most were
afraid to stay in their own homes.

375
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,599
ln order to survive, they
fled to a nearby hill.

376
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:01,719
Thank you.
- l am sorry there could'nt be more.

377
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,800
l am still hungry mama.
- l know darling l know.

378
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:21,199
Papa can we go find Malik in Abyssinia.
- They won't let us go my son.

379
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:25,159
Do you think Malik knows
what's happening to us?

380
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,239
l sent a message
but l don't know Hadi.

381
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:43,679
You can't leave now Malik, not alone. - l
can't stay here while my family suffers.

382
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,960
That's all day's Ammar.
- Prophet's wife Khadija has sold...

383
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:53,719
...everything she has for these few
provisions. Still it won't last for long.

384
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,320
Who would have tought this
would go on for three years?

385
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,280
You are weak Messenger of God.
l know lslam teaches patience and...

386
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,159
...perseverance but you can't keep
giving up your food for others.

387
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,400
What is it?

388
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,360
Tell Muhammad...

389
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,159
...l will deliver his message to Quraysh.
- You are not well.

390
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,400
l am well enough.

391
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:00,480
l am sorry to see you are
not feeling well Abu Taalib.

392
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:07,239
l doubt that. lf l die the rule
of this council falls to you.

393
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,360
And than it would be easier to deal
with Muhammad, would'nt it?

394
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,440
Yes it would.
- Well than, what l have to say may...

395
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:24,239
...please you. Muhammad has
reviewed something to me.

396
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,039
lf it is false, he is yours to
do with as you please.

397
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:40,119
lf it is true, you will end your
boycott on him and all muslims.

398
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:47,320
What is it?
- lt is this; the boycott that you signed...

399
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:52,920
...and hang in the Kaaba
has been eaten by insects...

400
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:56,880
...except for the
following words...

401
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,519
...''In the name of God''.

402
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,639
Malik.

403
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:36,719
You have come.
- Mother.

404
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:41,599
Just in time to go home.

405
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,840
lt was a better time and
little season of peace.

406
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:59,119
Oh it looks wonderfull.
- Thank you Celile. Malik.

407
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,360
Celile come quickly. The
Prophet's wife is sick.

408
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,119
Khadija, oh no.

409
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,280
Go Celile.

410
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,239
She's gone.

411
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,079
25 years they shared. She was
the mother of his children.

412
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:43,079
The first believer, his friend.

413
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:55,840
We called this time the year of sadness.
Because Abu Taalib was dying too.

414
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,880
Come here Muhammad.

415
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,280
Quraysh asked one
thing before l die...

416
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:18,239
...that l will get your word...

417
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,079
...to leave their
religion alone.

418
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,280
We will not attack or preach against you
if you agree not to preach against us.

419
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,119
Than the Prophet peace and (peace
and lessings be upon him ) said:...

420
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:36,000
'' l will. ''
- Did you here? lt's over.

421
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:43,559
And quickly added: "All I ask is one word
of assurance from you. If you give it...

422
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,440
...all of Arabia and Persia will be yours.
- Speak then.

423
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:53,199
Witness with me that there is one
God and deny all the others. ''

424
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:07,719
Oh nephew l knew
when they brought...

425
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,320
...you to me
as a boy that...

426
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,360
...you were
something special.

427
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:23,880
And you are.
You are.

428
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:47,000
My day has finally arrived.
l am now your leader.

429
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:53,599
Yes. Well at name at least.
Call your self king if you want.

430
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,039
But don't ever
get in my way.

431
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,639
Good. Now let's solve
problem number one shall we.

432
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:06,039
The muslims.
- No, Muhammad.

433
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:38,280
The muslims.
- No, Muhammad.

434
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,280
l can't stand to see them pray
and walking around so free.

435
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:48,760
Peace Abu Jahl, where swords have
failed us, words shall cut deep.

436
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,000
Ah, our poets.
- They are turning the people against...

437
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:56,760
...Muhammad as we speak.
Even Abu Lahab is doing well.

438
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:58,800
Beware friends.

439
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,880
My nephew, over there has revolution
in his heart. - Revolution?

440
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,239
He says he is a Prophet. But what he
really wants is to make himself king...

441
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,880
...over us all!
- Make him suffer.

442
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,599
When Muhammad says our ways are
wicked, when he says our gods are...

443
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:25,400
...nothing more than silent stone,
he's not only attacking you...

444
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,000
...he's attacking your fathers.

445
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:36,039
He's saying they are all
wicked and stupids.

446
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:40,960
Shall we endure such dishonor?
- No!

447
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:45,000
lt won't be long before
the beatings begin.

448
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:50,000
Now there is no Abu Taalib to
protect us. And nowhere to go.

449
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,559
Bilal, right.
- Yes do l...

450
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:57,079
l am Barrah. l came last year with
twelve others to hear the Prophet.

451
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:02,079
Oh from Yathrib, yes.
- We follow lslam, with all our hearts.

452
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,880
You hear that, twelve
believers in Yathrib.

453
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,079
No, hundreds. The Prophet must
come to Yathrib, we need...

454
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,599
We can't talk now.

455
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,960
Messenger of God will meet
you on hill El Akaba, tonight.

456
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:36,800
Messenger of God, please say you'll
come to Yathrib. Our city is filled with...

457
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:42,079
...bloodshed, brother fighting brother.
Only you and your message can bring...

458
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:45,159
...peace. Say you will come.

459
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,840
lf you do, we promise to
protect and defend you.

460
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,039
God has opened a door
O Messenger of God.

461
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:59,400
The Prophet (peace and blessings
be upon him ) accepted.

462
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,800
And he instucted all of
us to leave for Yathrib.

463
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:08,920
l am too scared to leave at night.
-The Messenger of God does'nt want...

464
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:11,719
...anyone to know we are leaving.
- Why could'nt we leave with...

465
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,880
...everyone else?
- We could'nt all leave at the same time.

466
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,480
That would be too dangerous.
- lt's time.

467
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,800
Muslims have all gone. But Muhammad
stayed to protect those who...

468
00:48:00,039 --> 00:48:07,000
...were left behind. Now it's time for us to
decide what to do with Muhammad.

469
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:10,679
Throw him in prison.
- No, exile the man.

470
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,039
Yes, yes. Take him to the edge
of the desert and drop him off.

471
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:19,119
Let him go. lt's out of Mecca
is'nt that what we wanted?

472
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,039
Not if he's going to build
an empire in Yathrib.

473
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,159
Well, what if we...
-Kill him.

474
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:32,719
But whoever kills him will be attacked by
Muhammad's clan and others.

475
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,719
Who will be the one?
- Who said it must be just one?

476
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:45,599
Take one strong man from
each clan and kill him together.

477
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,719
That way the blood of Muhammad
would be on everyone's hands.

478
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:56,840
Then, there can
be no revenge.

479
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,159
Good idea.

480
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,639
Muhammad (peace and blessings be
upon him ) knew what they planned.

481
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:15,679
And on that night he asked his cousin Ali
( God's blessings be upon him ) to sleep...

482
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,519
...in the Prophet's bed. Knowing
no harm will come to him.

483
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,119
He's there.
- When do we go in?

484
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:35,320
We don't. We will wait until he leaves
the house for his morning prayers.

485
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,320
Then...

486
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:42,320
As the night through on, the Prophet
(peace and blessings be upon him )...

487
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:48,159
...prayed. And one by
one the assassins fell asleep.

488
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,880
He went to Abu Bakr and
together they left Mecca...

489
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,039
...and hid in a nearby
mountain cave.

490
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:48,360
Are you all waiting here for Muhammad?
l passed him hours ago on his way out...

491
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,639
...of town.
- That's impossible.

492
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:58,159
Where is he?

493
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,039
One hundred camels to the
man who finds him. Go!

494
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:36,480
What are you doing?

495
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:39,119
Get out of my
tent!

496
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,079
Take this!

497
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,639
This way.

498
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:55,800
lnto the mountains, are you sure?
- l am sure. ln a few hours your 100...

499
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,639
...camels will be mine.

500
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,518
ls he in there?

501
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:33,079
l don't see any foot prints.
- He is in there.

502
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,800
There is no way he could have got in
here without braking off this web.

503
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,639
Or this nest.
You fool!

504
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:58,360
Later that night before leaving for
Yathrib, the Prophet (peace and...

505
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,440
...blessings be upon him )
looked down the Mecca.

506
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,800
lt was a city build
with memories for him.

507
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:13,239
Where his children were born,
where his wife had died.

508
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:19,400
He said: '' Of all God's earth,
that are the dearest place underneath...

509
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:25,960
...and the nearest under God and
have not my people driven me out...

510
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,760
...l would not have left thee.

511
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,719
No man can survive this
warm in the desert.

512
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,840
Maybe the reports are wrong,
maybe he was cought after all.

513
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,679
He was'nt captured
and he will be here.

514
00:53:56,679 --> 00:54:00,079
He is coming!
The Prophet is coming!

515
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,000
For the first time we were
able to worship without fear.

516
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:52,800
The days were long and
filled with hard work.

517
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:55,280
But , we were happy.

518
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,679
Now be good with him, mind
your teaching. Come on Hadil.

519
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,518
l am going to stay here and help
papa and Malik build the mosque.

520
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:05,800
After your lesson. Prophet
says you must learn to read.

521
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,840
Hi papa.
- Hey papa, l am going to stay here...

522
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,880
Lessons first.

523
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:26,719
and bes...tow
plenty upon...

524
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,920
its...people.

525
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,360
lncredible.
- Can l go to the mosque now?

526
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,800
You may Hadi.

527
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:43,480
And be...
- Bestow.

528
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:48,800
Oh, bestow plenty...

529
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,920
For my children's teacher.
- lt's beautiful.

530
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:07,800
Messenger of God let me carry
that, you are the Prophet.

531
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:10,800
lt's time for you
to take a rest.

532
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,920
The Prophet (peace and blessings
be upon him ) taught us that all...

533
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,159
...muslims were brothers and sisters.
One community standing shoulder to...

534
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,480
...shoulder in prayer. And he
wrote document declaring...

535
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,239
...all people in Yathrib would
live as equals in peace...

536
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:31,719
...regardless of race or religion.

537
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:34,440
Look.

538
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:43,159
What is it?
- He's calling us to prayer.

539
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,880
Mama, are we the happiest
people who ever lived?

540
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,599
What do you think?

541
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:07,760
l think....yes...

542
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:11,000
...because...

543
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,960
Yathrib was renamed the city
of the Prophet, El Medina.

544
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,239
That's it.

545
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,760
Everything the muslims left
behind has been accounted for.

546
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:33,599
Good. We'll take it all in our caravan to
Damascus and trade every last scrap...

547
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:37,440
...of it. lt belongs
to us now.

548
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:57,280
They have taken all of our possessions.
And after they sell them in Damascus...

549
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,079
...they'll be on their way back to
Mecca with baskets full of gold.

550
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:06,039
They continue to cut off trade to us
and we are starving again.

551
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:10,599
O Messenger of God, l know
you hate violence but...

552
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:15,000
And then The Prophet (peace and
blessings be upon him ) said:...

553
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,920
'' We will go out and
meet the caravan...

554
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:22,239
...and take back
what is ours. ''

555
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:28,400
Muhammad has left Medina with
300 men to take this caravan.

556
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,440
Ride to Mecca. Tell them to send an
army as fast as they can to protect...

557
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,679
...these riches.

558
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,440
Turn here and take the
sea root back home.

559
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:50,039
Our army leaves this morning and
you are going to fight in my place.

560
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:54,119
l won't do it!
- Fight for me and l'll consider your...

561
00:58:54,239 --> 00:59:00,039
...dept paid. Refuse, l will
kill you here on this spot.

562
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:02,079
l....

563
00:59:05,518 --> 00:59:08,000
What's this?

564
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:14,000
Finally.

565
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,960
Abu Jahl is just two days
march from the muslim camp.

566
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:24,518
Tell them l am out of
danger and turn back.

567
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:27,079
But he has outnumbered
three to one.

568
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,280
Not good enough!
Not against Muhammad.

569
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,840
Tell him to turn
back to Mecca.

570
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,440
By all the gods l have not
come this far to turn back!

571
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:45,960
No, not until
Muhammad is dead!

572
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:50,599
When The Prophet (peace and blessings
be upon him ) found out we were no...

573
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:55,360
...longer facing 30 armed
escorts, but an entire army...

574
00:59:56,119 --> 01:00:00,199
...he called for sura, a
council of his people.

575
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:06,559
l guess l am the last to speak.
Whatever you choose, we will do.

576
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:12,199
Then The Prophet (peace and blessings
be upon him ) said: '' Go forward full...

577
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:16,719
...of faith. Or God has
promised either the caravan...

578
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:20,039
...or victory on the battlefield. ''

579
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:36,518
They met the Meccan army
at the wells of Bedir.

580
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:48,239
Have my spears ready, stay close to
me. And above all, help me find Bilal.

581
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:51,559
The battle began
according to tradition.

582
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:54,639
Hamza took up his sword
and called two to join him.

583
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:57,518
'' Ubayda, Ali. ''

584
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:44,760
For Mecca and the gods!

585
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,039
They fight like lions.

586
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:49,800
Bilal.

587
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,199
Umayya.

588
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:34,320
Sound the retreat.

589
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,800
They are running!

590
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:03,159
Abu Lahab.
- You've returned.

591
01:04:03,518 --> 01:04:06,280
l have paid my dept.

592
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:12,360
One last thing you should know, God
fights on the side of your nephew.

593
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:17,679
Help me. Noone
will help me?

594
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,119
Please.

595
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:35,119
That fool! ldiot l told him to turn back!
- We'll get another chance.

596
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:38,880
That's not the point.
We lost our first chance.

597
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,880
Now they think God
fights on their side.

598
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,679
Mark my words, it will be near
impossible to bring him down.

599
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:50,360
He's only a man.
- No! You're only a man. His kind...

600
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:55,039
...comes around much once. As the
gods are our witness...

601
01:04:55,159 --> 01:04:58,360
...every scrap of this gold
will be used against him.

602
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:02,960
We'll buy weapons and horses.
l will show Muhammad...

603
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:05,760
...who's power is greater.

604
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:10,199
Mecca has raised an army
of 3000. And they are coming.

605
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:11,518
Mecca has raised an army
of 3000. And they are coming.

606
01:05:11,518 --> 01:05:14,239
We are only 700.

607
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:18,639
After consultation with Prophet (peace
and blessings be upon him ) declared:

608
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:23,679
'' We will meet the approaching
enemy at the mountain of Uhud. ''

609
01:05:35,518 --> 01:05:38,518
We are ready
Messenger of God.

610
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:45,639
The Prophet says you must not leave
this hill whether we're winning or losing.

611
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,079
You must not let them
attack from the rear.

612
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,199
Muhammad.

613
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,440
Hamza!
They killed Hamza.

614
01:06:34,518 --> 01:06:36,840
The Meccans are falling back.

615
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:41,480
What are you doing?
Fight. Fight!

616
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:47,840
Stop! Turn back and fight!

617
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,440
They are breaking wings.

618
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:54,800
We have to retreat.
- No, not yet. Look.

619
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,360
Where are you going?
- To help fight.

620
01:06:58,518 --> 01:07:03,039
No, The Prophet says stay put.
- But they are running away.

621
01:07:03,159 --> 01:07:04,840
To the battlefield!

622
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,280
Stop!

623
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,400
Now!

624
01:07:26,518 --> 01:07:28,480
No!

625
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,159
Turn and fight!

626
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,400
Attack!

627
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,159
Look out!

628
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,440
Muhammad is dead!

629
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,000
No!

630
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,599
Stay with us O
Messenger of God.

631
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:17,279
Surround him, take
him to the hill. Retreat!

632
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:19,559
lt's all gone wrong.

633
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:26,000
ls Muhammad dead?
- l saw him fall my self.

634
01:08:28,198 --> 01:08:29,479
Hear me!

635
01:08:30,198 --> 01:08:35,198
Today is in return for Bedir.
Today our gods have won.

636
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:39,760
Our dead are in paradise.
Yours are in hell fire!

637
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:44,960
Believe what you wish. So long
as Muhammad is dead.

638
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,680
Muhammad lives!

639
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:55,800
Then let him live to know this. For
everyone of our man who died...

640
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,960
...today, we have
killed 4 of yours.

641
01:09:01,158 --> 01:09:03,680
Muhammad lives?

642
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,680
This is the glory Mecca
was meant to have.

643
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:15,118
Finish your sacrifices and
come out Abu Sufyan.

644
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:17,600
You are the one
who got us here.

645
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:21,960
Muhammad lives.
- So what? He's lost Hamza and so...

646
01:09:22,078 --> 01:09:26,800
...many others. Come,
join the celebration.

647
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,560
How dare anyone accept the glory?
When these two words...

648
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:35,520
...can still be spoken!
Muhammad lives!

649
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:42,560
Then it is settled. This is no longer a
battle between the muslims...

650
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:48,238
...and Mecca alone, no. Every
tribe leader pledges no rest...

651
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:52,279
...until all of Arabia is against
Muhammad, until the words...

652
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:58,800
...''Muhammad lives'' become
Muhammad is known over.

653
01:09:59,038 --> 01:10:01,640
Islam is through.

654
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,359
Not will be left alive.

655
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:08,479
l will give all of l have to
put an end to Muhammad.

656
01:10:11,158 --> 01:10:13,960
10000?

657
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:21,359
We've defeated armies twice our sizes,
four times our sizes. But 10000?

658
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:25,399
There is no way we can keep them out.
They'll divide and come at us from all...

659
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:30,078
...directions.
- What do you say Messenger of God?

660
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,680
ln Persia, when we feared
attack led by horseman...

661
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:39,640
...we dug a trench
around us.

662
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:37,840
What is this?

663
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:43,000
Such a thing has never been done.
Not in all of Arabia.

664
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:45,520
l say we wait.
- Find the narrowest section and...

665
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:49,198
...lead your men over.
Now!

666
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,840
Now!

667
01:12:05,158 --> 01:12:07,520
Keep trying!
- Sir...

668
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:12,158
Keep trying at one place and fill
in the blasted thing in another.

669
01:12:24,078 --> 01:12:27,399
30 days we've tried. The
troops are loosing heart.

670
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:32,078
Talk with tem then. You are a man
of words, get them excited.

671
01:12:32,198 --> 01:12:33,319
Whip them into a frenzy.

672
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,720
That won't do!

673
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:39,520
They think God is
with the muslims.

674
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:47,158
Very well then. Prepare for
one last all-out attack.

675
01:12:47,439 --> 01:12:52,880
At dawn, from all sides. We'll take
them by sheer numbers.

676
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:03,560
God willing, only a few of their
soldiers will clear the trench.

677
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,078
And we'll handle them before
they get in the city.

678
01:13:06,279 --> 01:13:08,520
But, if they do
enter the streets...

679
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,078
Would you drop these from the windows.
- Yes.

680
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:17,680
Oh Cahab, l am so scared.
- Don't be. lf we die, we'll be...

681
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:20,279
...together in paradise.

682
01:13:25,479 --> 01:13:28,399
Barricade the door after we go.

683
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:40,319
Now is the time to prove
that thou art mighty.

684
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:44,720
Muhammad also prayed (peace
and blessings be upon him ).

685
01:13:45,158 --> 01:13:50,399
God, revealer of the Book,
caller to account.

686
01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:56,118
Whatever the power it is the
protects Muhammad, overcome it.

687
01:13:56,238 --> 01:13:59,158
Turn the confederates to flight.

688
01:13:59,319 --> 01:14:05,640
And show these muslims once and
for all thy power reign supreme.

689
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:10,000
Turn them to flight and
cause them to quake.

690
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:07,238
Men of Arabia!

691
01:15:41,238 --> 01:15:45,238
Hold your ground, it will pass.
Hold your ground!

692
01:16:38,439 --> 01:16:40,880
Back to Mecca.

693
01:16:48,118 --> 01:16:51,038
God has saved us.

694
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:59,800
One day, The Prophet (peace and
blessings be upon him ) looked at us...

695
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:05,600
...and said: '' l dreamed that l enter the
Kaaba with it's key in my hand. ''

696
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:22,038
We shall journey to Mecca
for the pilgrimage...

697
01:17:22,198 --> 01:17:25,479
...and worship at
the holly Kaaba.

698
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:29,000
He's coming here?
Without weapons?

699
01:17:29,158 --> 01:17:31,840
He knows we can't crash
our peacefull pilgrimage.

700
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,319
All of Arabia will
rise up against us.

701
01:17:34,439 --> 01:17:37,198
Blast him!
Blast Muhammad!

702
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:40,960
There is nothing we can do.
Let them in.

703
01:17:41,078 --> 01:17:45,479
What? Bear the shame of
let in Muhammad worship in Mecca.

704
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,880
lt's over. lt's over.

705
01:17:49,038 --> 01:17:53,038
l am sending Suhayl. l will
let him promise the world.

706
01:17:53,158 --> 01:17:55,920
But the muslims
will not enter Mecca.

707
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:06,600
We suggest a compromise.
A peace treaty.

708
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:12,680
We promise not to attack any of your
people and you'll promise the same.

709
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,600
For ten years.

710
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:18,198
We will be allowed to enter Mecca,
worship at the Kaaba?

711
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:21,118
Most definitely.

712
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:25,038
Starting next year.

713
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:28,238
You came back without
even entering Mecca?

714
01:18:28,359 --> 01:18:32,399
But we will next year.
- And every year after that.

715
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:37,760
For ten years.
- For three days at a a time.

716
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:43,000
Do have ten years of peace.
Ten years.

717
01:18:43,158 --> 01:18:48,920
Yes. The message of Islam
can travel far in ten years.

718
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,920
Amr?
- Why are you going to Medina?

719
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:13,880
To see Muhammad.

720
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:19,078
For what reason?
What reason!

721
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:22,359
To become a muslim.

722
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:26,840
l thought you were coming to kill him.
- You ment to defend him?

723
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:33,000
How can we deny it any longer?
He is God's Prophet.

724
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:41,238
l bare witness that there
is no god but God...

725
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,439
...and you are
his Messenger.

726
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:52,158
And l bare witness that there
is no god but Allah...

727
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:57,720
...and you Muhammad
are his Messenger.

728
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:53,279
Many muslims
have been killed.

729
01:20:53,479 --> 01:20:56,319
They have broken the treaty.

730
01:20:58,038 --> 01:21:02,439
The Prophet (peace and
blessings be upon him ) decided,...

731
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:08,840
'' lt's time to return to Mecca.''
- Yes Messenger of God.

732
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:35,000
We are ready Messenger of God.
-On to Mecca!

733
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:48,920
Now they are the army of 10000 with
our greatest leader is at their head.

734
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:10,279
Hold! Stop where you are!
-l've come to speak with Muhammad.

735
01:22:11,038 --> 01:22:13,319
Show your hands.

736
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:17,158
No! lt would be foolish of
me to trying hurt him now.

737
01:22:17,319 --> 01:22:20,560
That never stopped you before.
- l come in peace.

738
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:26,118
You can't blame these men. Naturally
they are concerned. - Yes.

739
01:22:40,198 --> 01:22:45,800
Forgive us. We have
been cruel and unjust...

740
01:22:46,319 --> 01:22:50,920
...we have stolen,
tortured, killed.

741
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:56,000
We will not, can not
resist you any longer.

742
01:22:57,319 --> 01:23:01,359
The Prophet (peace and
blessings be upon him ) said:

743
01:23:02,359 --> 01:23:06,680
'' There will be no
executions, no purchase.

744
01:23:07,158 --> 01:23:10,760
Mecca will be healed
by the spirit of Islam.

745
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:16,479
l am certain it will. And
i too must witness...

746
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:20,880
...that there is
no god but God.

747
01:23:21,158 --> 01:23:26,238
And that you Muhammad,
are his Prophet.

748
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,399
l'll prepare the city.

749
01:23:33,479 --> 01:23:38,560
l am glad that despite
my best efforts l can say...

750
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:42,520
...''Muhammad lives''.

751
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:53,078
From rulers to the
simple robes of Islam...

752
01:23:56,038 --> 01:23:59,279
...may it always be so.

753
01:25:03,399 --> 01:25:08,720
You are free forever now my
friend, with body and soul.

754
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:31,359
Home at last.
- Thanks to God.

755
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:55,520
l'll never forget
the feeling of that day.

756
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,399
lt was filled with
indescribable joy.

757
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,319
A few years later in Medina
after a short illness...

758
01:26:04,038 --> 01:26:09,600
...The Prophet (peace and
blessings be upon him ) died.

759
01:26:10,359 --> 01:26:15,920
He was 63. He always lived
a simple and humble life...

760
01:26:16,078 --> 01:26:19,118
...giving everything
he had to the poor.

761
01:26:20,439 --> 01:26:24,800
l wish l had met The Prophet.
l wish l had heard him speak.

762
01:26:25,158 --> 01:26:29,600
Yes. But the words
of God live on.

763
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:33,920
Where will you go now?
- l don't know.

764
01:26:34,038 --> 01:26:38,038
l know. Maybe you can stay
here and work in Mecca.

765
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:41,038
What kind of
working you do?

766
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:45,880
lt's beautiful.
- l used to have a loom like yours...

767
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,600
...but l lost it,
l lost everything.

768
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,760
lf he had some wool, he could
use our loom don't you think?

769
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:58,479
Yes, yes he could.

770
01:26:59,399 --> 01:27:06,359
Sir, you could have Bashu's wool.
- No, it belongs to you.

771
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,960
No it belongs to you now.

772
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:17,920
Come on, we'll take him
to the market together.
