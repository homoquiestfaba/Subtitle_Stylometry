00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:22,900
so much as, um, classy,
understated, modern.

173
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:24,100
- It's incredible.
- Right?

174
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:25,834
- This is what Dad
always talks about.

175
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:27,800
- Build a community...
- And the people will gather.

176
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:29,066
- Yeah. That's what
we've always done.

177
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,600
- Look at this.
- Oh, is that for me?

178
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:32,400
- [laughs]
It's Mom's Christmas present.

179
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:33,633
- [gasps]
- Come on.

180
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:35,934
- Oh.
- We have some work to do here.

181
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:38,567
- What? [gasps]
- Let's wrap them up.

182
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,133
- Simon, you might not remember,

183
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,433
but Uncle Dave used to put out
these figurines

184
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,800
for each of the 12 days
of Christmas.

185
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:46,233
- Except there are
two of them missing,

186
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:49,000
so the real presents
are the new additions.

187
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:50,700
We have some shopping to do.

188
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:55,767
- Salt Lake City.
- I know.

189
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,333
- It just feels good.

190
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:58,767
- It's so amazing.

191
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,000
Hey, why don't you stick around
for a few more days?

192
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,367
You know I'm offering you

193
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,767
the world's most unreliable
inflatable bed.

194
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,467
- [laughs] Flat by morning...

195
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,934
- Every time!

196
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:10,600
- [laughs]

197
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:12,266
- [sighs]

198
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,367
So you still going
to France this year?

199
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,767
- Yeah, without Uncle Dave.

200
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,767
- You two loved
traveling together.

201
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,667
- I'll probably love
traveling alone.

202
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,600
- Yeah.

203
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,233
- Just, ooh, it was so much fun

204
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:29,333
hanging out with all
of his Parisian friends.

205
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:31,867
- Yeah.
- And I loved, you know,

206
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
the fact that he didn't care
that he spoke terrible French.

207
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:36,100
- Yeah. [laughs]

208
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:39,133
- I just...I think I gotta go.
- Yeah.

209
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:41,367
- And I think I might even stay.

210
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,333
[car horn honks]

211
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:45,934
[overlapping chatter]

212
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,066
[Dave laughs] Piano's
made out of "Chopsticks."

213
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,333
- [playing piano]
- [laughs]

214
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:52,934
[child clapping]

215
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:54,934
Are Nan and Pop
really selling the theater?

216
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:56,133
That's always what we would do,

217
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:58,200
is movies at the Madison,
you know?

218
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,967
- I know. Yeah.

219
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,033
I'll miss it, too.

220
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:04,133
- I love the way Uncle Dave

221
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:05,800
used to make sound effects
with this stories,

222
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:07,767
like the little robot that...
[whirs]

223
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,333
- I miss calling him
to ask if he'd just seen

224
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:11,734
the latest movie I just watched.

225
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,266
- Mm-hmm.
He had great taste in movies.

226
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,000
- He did, didn't he?

227
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,033
You remember that first
Christmas without your dad?

228
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,100
How it helped so much
to be around family?

229
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:23,633
That's our job this year.

230
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:27,600
You know, help Pop and Nan have
the best Christmas they can.

231
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:29,734
Make it easier, you know?

232
00:08:29,867 --> 00:08:31,967
Here.

233
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,133
You need whip cream.

234
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:35,000
- Okay, just give me
the whole can.

235
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:37,834
- Okay, take the whole thing.
- Come on. Come on.

236
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:38,900
- So...
- Yeah?

237
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:40,900
- got a big day
coming up tomorrow.

238
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:43,300
Do you think I could drive
partway to Hazelwood?

239
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:45,767
- Yes.
- I guess I need to let you

240
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,433
- drive at some point.
- Yes. Here. Take some of this.

241
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:50,900
- Fill it up. Oh.
- [door opens]

242
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:52,700
- Whoo-hoo!
- It's Meg.

243
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,900
So how'd it go?
Did you find everything?

244
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:58,400
- Almost.
I got a little distracted

245
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:00,500
by the carolers
and the window displays.

246
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:02,633
Part of me feels like
I should just stay here,

247
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,500
even though I'm going to Paris
right after Christmas.

248
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:06,100
- I don't know.
- I'm gonna say it again.

249
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:07,934
I think you need
to go through with the trip.

250
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:10,400
I mean, I love getting ready
for Christmas with family,

251
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,433
but I was just
so relieved to be here.

252
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:14,066
- Well, why don't
you stay longer?

253
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,033
- Really?
- Yeah!

254
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,400
Stay as long as you want.

255
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:19,000
- I mean, I can't miss
Christmas in Hazelwood,

256
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:20,500
but I would love it.

257
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,066
I might have to borrow
some clothes.

258
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,834
- [laughs] I love that you're
even pretending to ask.

259
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:26,700
You're wearing
one of my sweaters.

260
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:27,800
- Oh.

261
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,600
- What are you...
- That's better.

262
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:32,266
Goes with the sweater.

263
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,700
- Thanks.

264
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:37,166
- All right, so I will help
with the sale of the Madison

265
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,400
and help with Mom and Dad,

266
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:40,667
and you just stay
and take some space.

267
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:43,900
I'm glad you're here.

268
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:48,033
- Oh.
- I'm glad I'm here, too.

269
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,834
[both laugh]

270
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:51,367
- It's who you are now.

271
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,200
- Okay, so you're saying
that Dancer and Prancer

272
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,200
aren't as into reindeer games
as all the others?

273
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,066
- No. I was saying

274
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,667
that they probably
spend more time practicing.

275
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,333
- Oh, for all the dancing
and the prancing.

276
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:10,900
- Why would they
be named that otherwise?

277
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:12,500
- You make an excellent point.

278
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,567
- I still don't see why they
have to close the movie theater.

279
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,834
- Yeah. Well, I know.

280
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:21,567
Sometimes grownups have to make
decisions like that.

281
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,166
- Even though
you're fixing it up.

282
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,433
- Even then, kiddo.

283
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,567
Come on.
We still have one more errand.

284
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,433
- Ahh. It's so hard
to see it like this.

285
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,767
Must be extra hard for my mom.

286
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,734
- I guess let's go check inside.

287
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:49,734
- [sighs] Oh, gosh.

288
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:51,834
Look at it.

289
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:52,800
[sighs]

290
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:53,900
[camera clicks]

291
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:57,900
- [gasps] Jennifer Swift.
Look at you.

292
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,800
I heard you'd be home
longer than usual this year.

293
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:01,934
Are you moving back?

294
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,300
- Oh, no, no, no. We're just...

295
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:04,600
We're here for Christmas.

296
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:06,567
- Second home? Think it over.

297
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,266
- Okay. Um,
you remember my son Simon.

298
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,467
Barb Hutter's
the real-estate agent

299
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,533
handling the...
the sale of the theater.

300
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:15,433
- Yeah.
Bigger every time I see you.

301
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,834
You probably shave now,
don't you? [laughs]

302
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:20,800
[sighs]

303
00:11:20,934 --> 00:11:23,400
- This place...
- Yeah.

304
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:25,734
- Nobody loved this theater
like your Uncle Dave.

305
00:11:25,867 --> 00:11:28,633
I know it was a tough choice
for your parents to let it go,

306
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:32,333
but I tell you, I am determined
to find the right buyer.

307
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:34,066
- Well, if anyone can, Barb...

308
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,500
- No question, it's me.
And thank you. [laughs]

309
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:38,867
- Ohh.
- Yeah.

310
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,967
- Oh, I've gotta get
these photos up on our site.

311
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,433
Uh, do you need keys?
Here. I have extra sets

312
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:44,934
- if you'll lock up.
- Oh, that's great.

313
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:46,033
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

314
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,700
- All right. See you around.

315
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:49,100
- Okay.

316
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:50,900
- [door closes]
- What?

317
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:54,567
- She's, uh, something.

318
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:02,600
Ohh. [sighs]

319
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:05,133
Look at this.

320
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:09,000
Oh, this piano.

321
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:11,033
- Didn't Uncle Dave know,

322
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,433
like, three songs on this?

323
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:14,000
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

324
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,567
- Hey, he used to play
"Sleigh Bells,"

325
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,367
and then Megan and I
would force the audiences

326
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,133
to watch our Christmas dances,
and they loved it.

327
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:25,200
- [door opens]
- Oh, we brought the house down.

328
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,200
[girl laughs]

329
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,033
- Jennifer Swift.

330
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,333
- Eric!

331
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:31,100
- Yeah. It's been a long time.

332
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:33,600
- Yeah, it's been, what, years?

333
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:36,233
- Yeah, think so.
- Uh, this is my son Simon.

334
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:37,800
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

335
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:39,233
- Yeah, you, too.

336
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:41,467
You know, your mom was my old
high school debate nemesis.

337
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,800
- You know, that's funny,

338
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:44,333
because she's
my current debate nemesis.

339
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:45,667
- Hey, I like
to win an argument.

340
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
- And I know better
than to argue with that.

341
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,367
- And this...
- [chuckles]

342
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,667
- this is Madzie.

343
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,633
This is my daughter.

344
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:55,000
- Hi, Madzie. I'm Jennifer,

345
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:56,500
- and this is Simon.
- Hi.

346
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:57,900
- Hi.
- I'm gonna go check it out.

347
00:12:58,033 --> 00:12:59,300
- Where are you going?
- I was just thinking

348
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:01,066
that I would go check out
the projection booth.

349
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,333
- Can I come?
- Sure.

350
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:03,533
Let's go on an adventure.

351
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,066
Come on.

352
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:09,066
- So my parents said
that you are working

353
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,400
on some repairs around here.

354
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:12,300
I never saw you
as a contractor type.

355
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:13,967
- Well, I am indeed
full of surprises.

356
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,100
- Yeah, you are.
And you're a city councilman.

357
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:18,133
- Yeah. See? Surprise.
- Yeah.

358
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:20,367
- Ah, Madzie and I
moved back here a few years ago,

359
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,567
and now I'm the head

360
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,033
of the Hazelwood
Historic Preservation Board.

361
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,166
- That's a mouthful.

362
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,967
- [laughs] It is.
I mean, but seriously,

363
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,000
what has more history
than the Madison theater, right?

364
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:28,967
- Yeah.

365
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,467
[plays notes]

366
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,867
Dave and I were
working out plans

367
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,834
to bolster the integrity
of the place when...

368
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:35,300
- Right.
- Yeah.

369
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:37,233
- And how much integrity
does the place need?

370
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:39,166
- Uh, you know what?
It's in pretty decent shape

371
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,233
- actually.
- Really?

372
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:41,533
- I just...Yeah, it's...

373
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:42,533
- [laughs] See?
- Oops.

374
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,133
- Just needs a little love.

375
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:46,734
I just want to make sure whoever
buys it keeps all these details.

376
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,066
I mean, you don't see a lot

377
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,266
of old movie theaters
like this anymore.

378
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,667
- Yeah, exactly. I mean,

379
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,000
I can't imagine somebody
getting rid of this piano

380
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,166
or these seats
or these gorgeous curtains.

381
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,767
Do you know
that my great-grandmother

382
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,233
made these curtains?

383
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:01,467
- Seriously?
- Yes.

384
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,333
- See, exactly.
What is Christmas

385
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,033
without movies
at the Madison, right?

386
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,867
So my thought is we'll just try
to repair as much as we can,

387
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,333
and hopefully the new buyer will
want to keep things that way.

388
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:13,433
- You know, I remember you
being a lot more difficult.

389
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:15,734
- Honestly? Same.

390
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:17,233
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

391
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:20,967
So I hear you're a big deal
in the restaurant world now.

392
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,900
- Oh, who said that?
- Meg.

393
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:24,266
We're in the same
dodgeball league.

394
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,000
- Yeah, well, we do.
We have a restaurant,

395
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,100
and we serve fairly decent food.

396
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:29,133
- Do you?
- Yeah.

397
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:30,667
- I'm not surprised.
- Dad!

398
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,533
Simon knows a lot
about how projectors works.

399
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:34,834
- Is that right?

400
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:37,066
- What can I say?
Old movies are the best movies.

401
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,000
- They are. So listen. We just
came to drop a few things off,

402
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:41,800
but I have a meeting
with a possible buyer

403
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:43,266
at your parents' cafe, actually.

404
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,300
- Well, nothing says
high-powered, cutthroat

405
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:46,934
business deal
like muffins and cocoa.

406
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:48,867
- All the best business deals
start with baked goods.

407
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,166
- [laughs] Yes, they do.

408
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,667
- Also they...they keep an eye
on Madzie for me.

409
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
- Well, we were
just heading over there.

410
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:56,667
Who's in the mood
for hot chocolate?

411
00:14:58,033 --> 00:14:59,834
- All right.
- Let's do it.

412
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,367
- Thanks.

413
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,433
MAN: Are you doing
the peppermint mocha this year?

414
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,734
- Oh, my gosh, yeah.

415
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:12,433
[entry bell rings]

416
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,767
- Hello, hello.
- Hey, there they are.

417
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,033
- [laughs]
- Hi.

418
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,734
- Hi, Pop.
- Hi.

419
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:20,400
- Oh, come here
and hug your mother.

420
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:22,100
Oh, honey, hi.

421
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:23,567
[gasps] Oh, my gosh!

422
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,900
Honey! I barely know you.

423
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:27,166
- You saw me at Thanksgiving.

424
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,934
- I see what I see, kid.
You are growing up.

425
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:31,600
- Merry Christmas, Pop.
- You know,

426
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:34,400
you do look more like your dad
each and every day.

427
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,834
- So, Madzie, hey, the usual?

428
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:38,934
- Yes, ma'am.

429
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:41,000
- Oh. Wow.

430
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:43,667
Simon, Madzie is working

431
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,867
on an entire town's full
of gingerbread houses.

432
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,967
- Oh!
- Just like your mom

433
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,066
- and Aunt Meg used to do.
- We did.

434
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
- Want to help?
- Yeah, of course.

435
00:15:56,367 --> 00:16:01,100
- Okay, so you put
a little candy...

436
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:05,100
- With the snowman contest
and the Christmas tree lighting,

437
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:07,600
I don't know, this year
just got so much busier.

438
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,133
I'm not sure how.

439
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:11,166
- We went by the theater today.

440
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,800
How you holding up?

441
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:17,367
- Well, honey,
if I had known last Christmas

442
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,533
was the last
with your Uncle Dave,

443
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,300
I'd have, you know...I'd have...

444
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,266
Um, but I'm fine.

445
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:28,767
Just takes time.

446
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,734
- Yeah.
- Okay?

447
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,266
Selling the theater
is the right thing to do.

448
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,734
I just wish we had
one more Christmas.

449
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,033
[laughs] You know...

450
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,133
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

451
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,300
- Get to work.
- All right.

452
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:46,734
- Let's make sure
we've got plenty.

453
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:47,834
- Stars?
- Yeah.

454
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:50,700
Oh, boy. You guys

455
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,400
have really
made some progress.

456
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:55,166
- I think Simon's eating
more than he's contributing.

457
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,200
- I'll bet.

458
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,867
Hey, Barb. How'd it go?

459
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,633
- That was Steve Crosby
from StarMark Cinemas.

460
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:03,667
- Wait. StarMark,
the chain of theaters?

461
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,633
- Yes, but I told him
he's gonna have to adhere...

462
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:07,767
- It can't be a chain.
They're gonna take out all of...

463
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,300
- No, no, no.
Hold on. He did say

464
00:17:09,433 --> 00:17:10,767
he would look into
preserving the theater.

465
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,100
- Yeah, and I'll make sure
the town council

466
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:13,567
stays on top of him.
He's got to honor...

467
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,000
- They're not gonna honor that.

468
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:17,000
- Let's just wait until
we have more information.

469
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:23,200
- My favorite part of Christmas

470
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,967
used to be the Christmas
cartoons at the Madison.

471
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,233
- My Uncle Dave used to let me
pick out those cartoons.

472
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:31,867
- Eric...

473
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:37,800
how hard would it be
to do one more movie night?

474
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:39,400
- Uh, what do you mean?

475
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:42,500
- Well, you know, like,
Christmas at the Madison?

476
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:45,333
Like just one more movie night,
just for the family?

477
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:46,834
Like, how hard would that be?

478
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:49,967
- Well, I mean, there's still
a lot of repairs to do.

479
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,400
- Yeah.
- I don't know if you'd be able

480
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:52,500
to get everything done in time.

481
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:53,533
- Okay, but...but...

482
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:56,667
theoretically
it would be possible

483
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,700
to have one more
Christmas movie night?

484
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:06,533
Ohh.

485
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:10,200
Let's get you open
one last time.

486
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:34,800
[sighs]

487
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:38,200
Oh.

488
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,100
- That was...Oh, it's so funny.

489
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:44,367
[laughs]

490
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,834
Would you wear that hat?

491
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,367
I love that.

492
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,467
Oh, look. Look.

493
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,533
- Ohh.
- Morning.

494
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,066
- Oh, good morning.
- Hi.

495
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,633
- Mwah!
- Ohh.

496
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,000
- Oh, no.

497
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:57,367
This picture of you
in the Christmas pageant.

498
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,033
- Oh, yeah. That hair.
You better be careful.

499
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,467
Awkward teen years
run in our family.

500
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,767
- Ohh. Hey,
you want some coffee?

501
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,900
- Yes, I'd love some, thanks.

502
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:07,667
- Wait. This is
Eric from yesterday.

503
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,734
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

504
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:09,800
- Why are you guys
dressed like that?

505
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:11,100
- Like we're running for office?

506
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,333
Debate tournaments.

507
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:14,033
- They were on the same team.

508
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:17,233
You never would have known it.
So much bickering.

509
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:19,300
- They would have
been unstoppable

510
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:20,333
if they worked together.

511
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:22,600
- Thank you. Here.

512
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:24,266
- What...
- Ooh.

513
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,533
- It's 12 days before Christmas,
and Meg said it'd be okay.

514
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,066
- Okay. [laughs]

515
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,834
Oh, my. Okay.

516
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:35,200
[sighs]

517
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,700
It's Dave's Christmas village.

518
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:39,266
- Yeah, it's a little
Scones and Sweets.

519
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,000
- Ohh!
- I know Dave liked

520
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:43,700
to put 'em out one at a time
leading up to Christmas.

521
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:45,567
- [inhales] It's perfect.

522
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,967
Thank you.

523
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,600
- You're welcome.
- [sighs] Ohh.

524
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,533
Right there.

525
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:58,734
[laughs]

526
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:02,467
- So what have you two got
planned for the rest of the day?

527
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,633
Uh, tonight is
the big snowman contest.

528
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:07,667
- Well, actually we were
planning on having one more...

529
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,567
- Scone. Scone.
We were gonna have...

530
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,633
- Here. Let's split it.
- What? You were going to...

531
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:13,567
- Mmm! Oh, that's so good.

532
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,900
[mouth full] Oh, yeah!

533
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:17,300
Mmm! Ohh! Mmm!

534
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,233
We should get dressed.

535
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:20,533
Thanks for the coffee.

536
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:21,834
Ahem!

537
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,367
I just don't want to get
Pop and Nan's hopes up.

538
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,967
I don't know
if it's gonna be possible.

539
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,700
I mean, it's been closed
for, what, six months?

540
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:34,033
- Yeah. So keep it a surprise.

541
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,900
- Yeah. Yeah, just until
we can take a closer look.

542
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:39,266
Thanks.

543
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:45,934
- Okay. Look, this one
is my favorite one of them all.

544
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:48,100
- So seats are in good shape.

545
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:49,433
We've already painted.

546
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:51,166
But the boiler's from the 1920s.

547
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,367
It was gonna
need replacing anyway,

548
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,834
so for now, the heat is...

549
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:55,967
- imaginary.
- [laughs]

550
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,266
- Popcorn machine needs fixing.

551
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,533
- And the projector's
a dinosaur, so...

552
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,967
- Great! We can work with that.

553
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,500
- We can work with this.
Come on, kiddo.

554
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:06,700
So there should be
a series of switches.

555
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:11,834
- Okay, so we got the lights,
the film, and the lens.

556
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:15,333
- Found the Christmas ornaments.

557
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:17,266
- [laughter]
- Yes, you did.

558
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,300
- Hmm.

559
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:21,934
- Oh. Oh!
- Hey!

560
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:22,900
- It works.

561
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,333
- Madz, come here.

562
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:27,233
- [gasps] Oh.

563
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,433
[electricity flickers]

564
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:39,133
- [sighs]
- Aw, no. The fuse blew.

565
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:40,967
- All right,
let's see what we can do.

566
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,300
- Shoot.

567
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:46,967
We can...Oh, I'm sorry.

568
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,467
- Pardon me. Whoop!
- Sorry.

569
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,400
- [laughs] My bad. Sorry.
- Ooh. Pardon me.

570
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:51,800
- Ohh! My bad.

571
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,867
- Oh, th...right there.

572
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,567
- Oh, yeah. Great, great.

573
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,200
- [gasps] You fixed it!

574
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,133
- Yeah.

575
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:03,033
Listen, I have to be honest.

576
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,967
If your family wants
to sell the theater,

577
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,667
having a movie night might...
I don't know,

578
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,600
might make buyers think you're
not serious about selling.

579
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:10,300
And then if Barb
needs to show the space

580
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:11,500
and your family's around...

581
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:13,066
- Barb is not gonna have
to show the space

582
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,700
while we're there
for one night with the family.

583
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,500
If she does,
we're just gonna clear out.

584
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:19,166
I really think
we can get this working.

585
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,266
It's just one night
of Christmas movies.

586
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,500
- I-I get why it would be great.
It's just I...

587
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,266
- And I can help.
I can fix things.

588
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,734
- Yeah, but can you
fix a projector?

589
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:29,133
- I can find someone
who fixes a projector.

590
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,934
What about Valerie Sanders?
Didn't she used to run it?

591
00:22:32,066 --> 00:22:33,400
- Yeah, she teaches
at the high school now.

592
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:34,600
- But you can't just...
- That's perfect!

593
00:22:34,734 --> 00:22:36,266
- I was in Girl Scouts with her.
- Oh.

594
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,567
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
and she likes every single one

595
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,934
of the photos I post online.
She's totally gonna be onboard.

596
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:42,266
- Yeah, totally.
- Eric,

597
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,700
I really think, with your help,
we could do this.

598
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,433
- [sighs]
- Right?

599
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,467
- Nobody wins a debate
against Jennifer Swift.

600
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,467
- You're right. He's right.

601
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:55,767
- Whoops.
- All right. I'll see you

602
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,133
- back at Nan and Pop's.
- Okay.

603
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:59,300
[cell phone chimes]

604
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:00,633
Meg?

605
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:04,734
- I want to help your staff
throw a blowout party.

606
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:08,300
I want to win the food bank
that money so badly.

607
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:11,533
So I was thinking,
what if I didn't go back

608
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:12,967
to Hazelwood for Christmas?

609
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,567
What if I stayed here
for a couple of days and...

610
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,367
- I think that's really smart.

611
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,600
- You do?
- Yeah.

612
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:20,467
And Simon is...I don't know.

613
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,266
It's like he's
opening up or something.

614
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,667
Oh, and I have this idea.

615
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,567
I want to do one last night

616
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,367
of Christmas movies
at the Madison,

617
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,533
but I don't know. It's scary.

618
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:31,734
- Oh, Jen,
I think that's really smart.

619
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:34,633
- You do? Eric thinks it might
scare off potential buyers,

620
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:36,700
- but I'm not sure. I...
- Oh.

621
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:38,767
City Councilman Eric Baker.

622
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,734
Your high school debate crush,
Eric Baker.

623
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:42,100
- Shh! Meg.

624
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:44,000
- Oh, what?
Can he hear me over the phone?

625
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:45,367
- Stop. It wasn't a crush.

626
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,166
- It was...
- Oh, please.

627
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,633
I was there. I love this.

628
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:50,333
But wait.
You don't think Mom and Dad

629
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:53,166
are gonna be upset if I don't
come home for a couple of days?

630
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,967
- I think they'd be glad
you're trying something new.

631
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,900
- Oh, sister swap.

632
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:00,300
I love this.

633
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:01,233
- I do, too.

634
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:02,533
All right. Well, um...

635
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:04,367
I love you. Call me
if anything comes up, okay?

636
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,567
- I promise I will.

637
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,600
I love you, too.

638
00:24:06,734 --> 00:24:08,533
- Bye.

639
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:10,367
She's never giving back my coat.

640
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,367
[overlapping chatter]

641
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:19,433
- Here.
- Oh. Ah, yeah.

642
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:20,600
POP: Hey, hand me that.

643
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,033
- Looks good.

644
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,934
[sighs] That is something.

645
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,900
- Ohh. Can't imagine
what it's gonna be like

646
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:31,400
when Madzie's that age.

647
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:33,767
- What they want most
is for you to leave 'em alone.

648
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,100
- It's that easy?

649
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:36,800
- Oh, no, no. It's torture.

650
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,700
You worry all the time, and
they never tell you anything,

651
00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:41,667
and it's not
for the faint of heart.

652
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
- Tell you what, though.

653
00:24:42,934 --> 00:24:44,633
Simon's been really kind
to Madzie.

654
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:46,266
You don't see
a lot of teenage boys

655
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,266
with that much patience
or heart.

656
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,600
- [sighs]

657
00:24:51,734 --> 00:24:53,266
- All right, come on, guys.

658
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:57,300
Put your stick in the sleeve.

659
00:24:57,433 --> 00:24:59,266
Okay, we'll try that.

660
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,667
Like that.

661
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,333
[lights clunk]

662
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:07,700
- Whoa ho!
- [applause]

663
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:10,066
Looks like your mom found
the switch to the marquee.

664
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,600
JENNIFER: Ohh.

665
00:25:16,734 --> 00:25:18,567
Oh, it looks great.

666
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,967
- Oh, it looks so wonderful
with the lights on.

667
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,266
- [laughs] Okay, don't cry.
Don't cry.

668
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
I have some good news.

669
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:27,100
- What?
- Simon and I talked to Eric,

670
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:30,133
and we think that,
before we sell,

671
00:25:30,266 --> 00:25:33,233
we can do one more,
for the family,

672
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:34,834
Christmas at the Madison.

673
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,767
- These are her happy tears.

674
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,066
- [laughs]

675
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,200
- Well, look at this.
- Hi!

676
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,000
- Are you reopening the Madison?

677
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:45,500
- Valerie, I was
actually gonna call you

678
00:25:45,633 --> 00:25:47,133
to come and look
at our projector,

679
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:50,033
but yeah. Yeah, I think we're
gonna do one more movie night.

680
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:53,233
- Dave would love this.
- Yeah, he would.

681
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:55,133
- Christmas at the Madison.
- Yeah.

682
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:57,800
- We should invite
Rita and Joyce to come with us.

683
00:25:57,934 --> 00:25:59,433
- No, no, no, that...
- Rita! Joyce!

684
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:02,100
- It was just for the family.
That's what she was trying...

685
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:03,834
- No, it's...
- No, everybody,

686
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:05,633
we were just saying
that it's only...

687
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:07,333
- Let's tell everybody.
- No, guys, it's not...

688
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:08,800
- Well, no, don't...
- No, it's...

689
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,000
- We're not even sure
it's gonna work.

690
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:11,967
- I...
- Yes!

691
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,700
- So it looks like

692
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:15,867
you may have just invited
the whole town.

693
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,767
[woman laughs]

694
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,500
- Yeah, that got away from me.

695
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,166
t]

696
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:35,767
JENNIFER: Well, it was supposed
to be just for the family,

697
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,200
but now that the whole town
is so excited to come,

698
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:40,266
I guess I gotta
throw a bigger event.

699
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,300
- If anyone can, it's you.
- Ohh.

700
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:44,133
- [sighs] You've been
through so much,

701
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:45,567
and you kept going.

702
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,367
- Oh, I just hope
things at the restaurant

703
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,867
aren't too much
for Meg to handle.

704
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,533
- [laughs] If I needed
to throw a party,

705
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:53,300
your sister
is the one I would call.

706
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:55,533
She's been running
our place forever.

707
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,367
I'm sure
you don't need to worry.

708
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,100
- Well, I need to worry
a little bit.

709
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:00,800
It's a big deal
for Umber and Sprig.

710
00:27:00,934 --> 00:27:02,967
- You and your sister
take good care of each other.

711
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,934
- Yeah.

712
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:05,900
- Your mom and Dave
did that, too.

713
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:09,533
- Yeah.
- You know, we're really happy

714
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:12,367
you could make it in
earlier this year.

715
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,934
Made a difference.

716
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,033
- For me, too.

717
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:17,800
- Oh, wow. Hi.

718
00:27:17,934 --> 00:27:18,834
[laughs] Hi.

719
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:20,867
- Eric and Madzie. Hi, guys.

720
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,200
- Is Simon here?

721
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,200
- Hey, let's go
find him together.

722
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:25,600
[Jennifer chuckles]

723
00:27:25,734 --> 00:27:26,834
- Here we go.

724
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:29,533
- [sighs]

725
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:30,734
- Simon's fitting right in.

726
00:27:30,867 --> 00:27:31,734
- Yeah.

727
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:33,667
[overlapping chatter]

728
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,934
- Even if I'm starting to feel
a little in over my head.

729
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:36,934
- How come?

730
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:38,767
- Well, now that
the whole town

731
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,033
is expecting a movie,
I guess I gotta figure out

732
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:42,200
how to get that boiler working.

733
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:43,800
- And the electric.
- Oh, gosh.

734
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:45,633
- I don't know why
that's been acting funny lately.

735
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:47,867
- All right, worst case,
there's no projector, no heat.

736
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,467
I know about five dance numbers
that Meg and I used to do.

737
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
I can teach you.

738
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:52,834
- Okay, no.
Look, I'm being serious.

739
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:54,066
I don't know how Steve Crosby

740
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,433
or any other buyer's
gonna take this.

741
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:57,100
- It's because
we have to let go of it

742
00:27:57,233 --> 00:27:58,700
that I want to do this.

743
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:00,300
My mom needs it,

744
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:03,133
and really it's something
that Uncle Dave would love.

745
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:05,900
- Well, look, I'm just here
to make sure it's preserved,

746
00:28:06,033 --> 00:28:08,800
so it might not be my place
to even have an opinion,

747
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:11,400
but I'm just...I'm not convinced
that throwing a big live event

748
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:14,166
is really the right thing
to be focused on right now.

749
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,767
- I think...
- NAN: Eric!

750
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,000
Hey, Jennifer, come here.

751
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,066
- [laughter]

752
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,633
NAN: Hey, guys.

753
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:26,266
- [laughs]

754
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,900
- Listen. Since Meg is
staying longer in the city,

755
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:31,533
would you and Madzie
like to join us

756
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:33,367
and help us
decorate our tree tonight?

757
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,166
- Oh, yeah.
- No, we don't want to intrude.

758
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,700
- Come on.
- I made so many cookies,

759
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:37,934
you'd be doing us a favor.

760
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:39,867
- Yeah. The more, the merrier.

761
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,033
- Hey, Madz, what do you
say to some cookies?

762
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,133
- Yeah!
- All right.

763
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:46,567
- You okay up there?

764
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,000
Don't slip or anything.

765
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:49,900
- Well, I mean, you're
the one holding the ladder.

766
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:51,100
Wait.
Are you holding the ladder?

767
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:52,667
- Yeah. Wait!
What's happening?!

768
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,500
- Are you okay?!
- [laughs]

769
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,633
- You're hilarious.

770
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:01,900
So you having fun?

771
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:04,900
- Um, yeah.
- It's different from the city.

772
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:07,867
- Yeah. But, I mean,
it's not different in a bad way.

773
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,567
I got to see the tubas
with Aunt Meg, and, uh,

774
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,100
now we get to go spend
some time with Nan and Pop,

775
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:15,100
so it's the best of everything.

776
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:16,533
- Yeah.

777
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,400
All right.
Ah, the marquee is up.

778
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:23,033
Valerie's gonna come look
at the projector, and, uh...

779
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:24,800
- I mean, it's still
a little cold in there, so...

780
00:29:24,934 --> 00:29:26,100
- Right. Yeah, Eric and I

781
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:28,300
are gonna see
what we can do about that.

782
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,500
Come on. Come on. Come on.

783
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:33,266
[sighs] Whoo!

784
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,100
[panting]

785
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:37,000
[powers down]

786
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:39,333
- Ah. So how's that coming?

787
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:41,867
- Oh. Heh. Good.

788
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,867
Then bad.

789
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,967
- Then good. Then bad again.
- Huh.

790
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,300
- And there's a dark corner
over there and over there.

791
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:50,734
This basement is really big.

792
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:53,667
- Yeah. Yeah, it really is.
- [grunts]

793
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,900
- Yeah, whoever buys this place

794
00:29:55,033 --> 00:29:56,900
is probably gonna, eh,
replace these lights

795
00:29:57,033 --> 00:29:59,967
and...and replace this beast
with central heat.

796
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:05,300
- Well, until then, I am
just going to try my hardest.

797
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:07,000
- Okay.
- You know, when my, uh,

798
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:09,533
husband died, I took over
everything at the restaurant,

799
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:12,467
so that meant all the repairs,
everything,

800
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,133
so that's my rule now,
is that I have to try it first.

801
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:18,333
[chuckles] It's...
You offering?

802
00:30:18,467 --> 00:30:21,200
- I'm offering, 'cause my rule

803
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:23,700
is to, uh, make myself useful.

804
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:25,600
- That is a...It's a good rule.

805
00:30:25,734 --> 00:30:28,367
- Try to help out where I can.
- Yeah, thank you.

806
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,066
- [grunts] Madzie's really
excited to be helpful.

807
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,266
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

808
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,266
- You know, I try
to protect my time for her.

809
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,633
- You know?
- Yeah.

810
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:38,100
- Be available
for what's important.

811
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:39,934
- Ah, it's always
the challenge, isn't it?

812
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:41,867
- Yeah. [grunts]

813
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,700
- Come on. Help me out
with this, will you?

814
00:30:43,834 --> 00:30:45,367
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Just give it a push.

815
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,200
- Go ahead. [grunts]
- Okay, ready?

816
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:48,433
- [hissing]

817
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:49,667
- Ohh!

818
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,000
[both laugh]

819
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:56,166
- Hey, did we just fix
something together?

820
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,200
- I think we did.
- Hah!

821
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:01,166
- Wow. I gotta go.
- Um...

822
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,800
Um, I told my mom
that I would...Oops.

823
00:31:02,934 --> 00:31:04,333
I slipped. She was...

824
00:31:04,467 --> 00:31:06,300
- um, my mom.
- Yeah, I...Yeah, you...

825
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:07,800
- Okay.
- Your mom.

826
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:09,533
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

827
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,567
- So I know
it wasn't an easy decision

828
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,700
to sell the Madison,

829
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,367
but did you ever
consider keeping it?

830
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,934
- Oh, of course, but we
would never have been able

831
00:31:21,066 --> 00:31:23,433
to run a movie theater
and a bakery.

832
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:24,700
- Hmm.
- And then Meg said

833
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:26,100
she wasn't interested.
And besides...

834
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:29,100
- Meg needs to spread her wings.

835
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:30,166
- Exactly.

836
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,467
- And you, well,
gosh, we never thought

837
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,233
- of asking you about...
- Oh, no, no, no.

838
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:38,533
I-I mean,
in another life, maybe.

839
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:40,200
It'd be a dream.
Simon and I would love it,

840
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:43,133
but, no, our lives are full.

841
00:31:43,266 --> 00:31:44,066
Very full.

842
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,066
- Anyway, the money was...

843
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,467
- Overwhelming.
Upgrading those projectors?

844
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,133
- Uh, the heating.
- All of it.

845
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:53,533
- Yeah. And so Barb says that
she's got some great new photos,

846
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:55,767
and so hopefully
we'll have a buyer soon.

847
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,300
- A buyer that's not a chain.

848
00:31:57,433 --> 00:31:58,433
- Mm.

849
00:31:58,567 --> 00:31:59,567
[cell phone chimes]

850
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,333
[chimes]

851
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:05,600
- [chimes]
- You guys, it's Meg!

852
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:07,166
- Hey.
- Hi!

853
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,100
- Hi, everybody. I missed you.

854
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:10,400
Are you decorating the tree?

855
00:32:10,533 --> 00:32:12,667
- We are.
- Yes.

856
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,433
- [chuckles] How are you?

857
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,000
- Um...

858
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:18,500
- Wait right there.

859
00:32:18,633 --> 00:32:20,367
I'll be right back.

860
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,300
What's wrong? Are you okay?

861
00:32:26,433 --> 00:32:29,800
- Did you know that Joe
doesn't know what mistletoe is?

862
00:32:29,934 --> 00:32:32,166
- Did you know that Mom and Dad
put peppermint Schnapps

863
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,000
in their hot cocoa
all season long?

864
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:35,233
- Did you not know?

865
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:36,934
- All right, focus.
What's the matter?

866
00:32:37,066 --> 00:32:38,767
- No, it's fine, really.

867
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,533
Everything,
it's all going so great,

868
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,467
and you have nothing
to worry about here.

869
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,166
Um, but I-I don't think
I'm gonna make it

870
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,834
to the Madison tomorrow night.

871
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,433
- Is there a problem?
Do you need me?

872
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:54,133
- No. No. I-I'm really
enjoying myself here.

873
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:57,633
I think it's probably
the first time

874
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:01,000
I've felt my grief lift
in a while.

875
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:03,967
- Ohh. I wish I could hug you.

876
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,100
Oh, of course. Stay there.

877
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:08,133
- Thank you.
Thanks for understanding.

878
00:33:08,266 --> 00:33:09,100
- Yeah.

879
00:33:09,233 --> 00:33:10,867
- Is everything
going okay there?

880
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,533
- Sort of. Um, I somehow...

881
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:15,900
managed to invite
the entire town

882
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:18,166
to Christmas at the Madison
tomorrow night.

883
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,800
But, I mean, it's gonna be fine,
right? Um, it's fine.

884
00:33:20,934 --> 00:33:22,333
- Wow. No,
that doesn't sound fine.

885
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,100
That sounds like magic.

886
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:25,333
Oh, good luck.

887
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:28,533
Give everyone there
a really big kiss for me.

888
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:29,533
- Ohh! Gosh!
- Oh!

889
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,033
- Sorry. Are you okay?

890
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:32,367
- That was Meg. It's just Meg.

891
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,567
She's so great...
to have a sister like her.

892
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,834
- Yeah?
- Come in. Come in.

893
00:33:36,967 --> 00:33:38,500
- [laughs]
- Yeah.

894
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:39,467
- Nice to see you.

895

["O Christmas Tree" playing]

896
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,934
- ♪ O Christmas tree,
O Christmas tree ♪

897
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:56,967
♪ Thy leaves are so unchanging

898
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,834
♪ O Christmas tree,
O Christmas tree ♪

899
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:02,100
♪ Thy candles shine...

900
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:03,700
JENNIFER: Every year,
we decorate the tree,

901
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,667
and then we stand back,
and we look at it,

902
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,200
and we try to figure out
what's missing.

903
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:09,734
- And then a few days later,
we all gather again,

904
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:11,734
and we exchange ornaments.

905
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:14,600
And sometimes we make them,
and sometimes we buy them,

906
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:18,066
but they remind us
of the year that has passed.

907
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,767
- So what's missing?

908
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,934
- Something homemade.

909
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:24,166
- Yes.
- I agree.

910
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,033
- Ohh!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

911
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,934
- You okay?
- I am so sorry.

912
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:46,533
I didn't see you there at all.

913
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,667
- It's all right.
There's water damage under here.

914
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,667
- Was it frozen?
Because I'm frozen.

915
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,767
We should have done
a better job with that heater.

916
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,834
- Yeah, we should have.

917
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,266
- You could put it
on the marquee.

918
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,033
- Just big "Bring coats."
- Maybe.

919
00:34:58,166 --> 00:34:59,600
- It's cold, very cold.

920
00:34:59,734 --> 00:35:01,767
But it's nice. It's nice.

921
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,200
Oh, it's so nice to see it
all lit up like this.

922
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:07,033
- Yeah, we are really excited

923
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:08,734
about showing
a movie here tonight.

924
00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:10,400
- It's all anyone's
talking about in town.

925
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:13,100
- And you're sure we're
not in the way of any buyers?

926
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:15,333
- That's what I came
to talk to you about.

927
00:35:15,467 --> 00:35:18,133
It's not so much
that there are buyers, plural.

928
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:21,934
It's just maybe
the one buyer, singular.

929
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:23,200
- And that is...

930
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:24,633
- Well, I've been talking
to Steve Crosby

931
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:26,734
from StarMark Cinemas,
and I really think

932
00:35:26,867 --> 00:35:28,200
he's gonna be your best offer.

933
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:29,800
And by best offer...

934
00:35:29,934 --> 00:35:33,266
I mean your only offer.

935
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,166
- That's a chain.
- Well, Steve did say

936
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,834
he'd work with the town
to preserve as much

937
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:38,133
of the historic elements
as he could.

938
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:39,800
- I'll talk to your parents
about it,

939
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:42,400
but I really think it's the best
that you're gonna do.

940
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:43,934
- All right. Thank you, Barb.

941
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:45,166
- All right. Bye.

942
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,667
- Bye, Barb.
- Toodles.

943
00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:50,567
[sighs] Okay.

944
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,667
Well, whatever's gonna happen
is gonna happen.

945
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,133
- Let's just put on
the best show we can tonight.

946
00:35:57,266 --> 00:35:58,567
- Yes. We're gonna make it

947
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,266
a night for Hazelwood
to remember.

948
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:06,467
- This trip to California
is your mother's real present,

949
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,300
but, uh, I need to find
something to wrap. Heh.

950
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:14,133
She has wanted to tour those
Hollywood landmarks for years.

951
00:36:14,266 --> 00:36:16,266
- Aw, who doesn't?
- [chuckles]

952
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,133
- Well, she's
gonna love the trip,

953
00:36:18,266 --> 00:36:20,066
but what are
we looking for exactly?

954
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,533
- Well, we'll...
we'll know it when we see it.

955
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:24,000
- Okay.

956
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:27,533
- Now, you've been spending
some time with an old flame...

957
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,433
- Oh, no, no, no.
Dad, Dad, Eric and I

958
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:30,967
have only ever
been just friends.

959
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,633
We live in different worlds,
different responsibilities,

960
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:35,967
jobs, kids.
It's just way too complicated.

961
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,767
- If it wasn't complicated,
it wouldn't be interesting.

962
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,934
- [gasps]

963
00:36:40,066 --> 00:36:41,900
Look what I found.

964
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,433
- Ah, there it is.

965
00:36:44,567 --> 00:36:45,667
[both laugh]

966
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,367
- Just stay open to it.

967
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,934
The Madison
is famously romantic.

968
00:36:51,066 --> 00:36:52,934
Your mom and I
had our first date there.

969
00:36:53,066 --> 00:36:55,166
- Dad, you're gonna
have to let this one go.

970
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,967
- You and Charlie
were very devoted to each other.

971
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,200
But there's nothing wrong with
wanting another chance at love.

972
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,567
- Hey, Pop.

973
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,900
Look at the bow tie
that I found.

974
00:37:07,033 --> 00:37:08,367
- Do they light up?

975
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,700
- They do.
- It's its best feature.

976
00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:12,066
- Well, we would be fools

977
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,200
not to wear them
to the Madison tonight.

978
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,233
Go grab a few.

979
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:16,967
- All right.

980
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,333
- Come on. Let's wrap this up.

981
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,400
We sure about the bow tie?

982
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,700
- Rules of the season.

983
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:27,834
It's ridiculous and perfect.

984
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:30,066
- Okay. I guess we're ready.

985
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,667
- [sighs] Yeah.

986
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,834
Are you nervous?

987
00:37:33,967 --> 00:37:36,100
- Oh, I'm so nervous.

988
00:37:36,233 --> 00:37:39,200
I just...I want it
to be special, you know,

989
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:42,233
for Nan and Pop
and the town and you.

990
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:44,934
I want it to have
all of the Christmas glory

991
00:37:45,066 --> 00:37:46,967
that it had when Uncle Dave
was there, you know?

992
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,300
- Oh, come on.
They're gonna love it.

993
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,233
And if they don't,
we'll love it.

994
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:51,233
This has been fun.

995
00:37:51,367 --> 00:37:53,033
- It has, hasn't it?

996
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:54,900
[chuckles] Oh.

997
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:55,967
- Mwah!
- [camera clicks]

998
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,633
- Oh, my...
- Hah! Gotcha.

999
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,934
Whew!

1000
00:38:00,133 --> 00:38:02,700
Let's do it. Come on.

1001
00:38:07,266 --> 00:38:09,066
- Hey.
- Hi.

1002
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,233
You look incredible.

1003
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:11,967
- Excuse me.
- Thanks.

1004
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,066
- Yeah?
- Jennifer, right?

1005
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,033
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

1006
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,400
Uh, Jen, this is Steve Crosby,

1007
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:17,100
the executive from StarMark
I was telling you about.

1008
00:38:17,233 --> 00:38:19,734
- Steve Crosby.
Nice to meet you.

1009
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:20,800
- Nice to meet you.

1010
00:38:20,934 --> 00:38:22,367
- Well, please,
go find some seats,

1011
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,367
and then maybe we can talk
after the movie?

1012
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,600
- I would love that.

1013
00:38:25,734 --> 00:38:27,066
- Great.

1014
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,867
- Ahh.

1015
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,233
Oh, one last thing.

1016
00:38:30,367 --> 00:38:31,700
- Oh, please tell me
it's good news.

1017
00:38:31,834 --> 00:38:33,367
- It is in fact good news.

1018
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,700
I talked to some of the
volunteers at the senior center,

1019
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:37,967
and they got a bunch
of extra blankets for us.

1020
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,100
- Oh, that's great!

1021
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,166
It's gonna be so cozy with...

1022
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,800
the extra blankets.
That's awesome.

1023
00:38:43,934 --> 00:38:44,967
Thank you, Eric.

1024
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,400
- You're welcome.

1025
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
[patrons chatting]

1026
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:03,533
- [applause and cheering]
- There she is.

1027
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
- Excuse me.
- What is it?

1028
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:11,100
- Is that right?

1029
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:12,767
[amplified]
Ah. Can you hear me?

1030
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,800
- Yes!
- Yep!

1031
00:39:14,934 --> 00:39:17,867
- Thank you all
so much for coming.

1032
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,600
- [applause]
- First of all,

1033
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:21,066
I want to apologize.

1034
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,767
We're so sorry
about the lack of heat.

1035
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,433
But you know what?
It's a winter movie,

1036
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:27,233
so it adds realism, right?

1037
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:28,700
- [laughter]

1038
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:33,300
- It is so wonderful
to see these seats full.

1039
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:36,967
Can I ask how many of you

1040
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,166
went on your first date
here at the Madison?

1041
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,300
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

1042
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:45,233
- And is there
anyone here tonight

1043
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:47,600
that's on their first date
right now?

1044
00:39:47,734 --> 00:39:49,333
You are. All right.

1045
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:50,767
[applause]

1046
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,233
Good luck. [laughs]

1047
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:55,000
Uncle Dave loved
that so many people

1048
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:57,166
had their first dates
right here.

1049
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,100
And it means the world
to me and my family

1050
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:06,033
that you've come here
for one last Christmas with us.

1051
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:08,300
And now, without further ado,

1052
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:12,700
I would like to invite you
to enjoy this classic film

1053
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:14,467
that was actually the only one

1054
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,834
we could get to run
through the projector, so...

1055
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:18,000
- [laughter]

1056
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:19,233
- Thank you.

1057
00:40:19,367 --> 00:40:21,600
- Yeah, Jennifer!
- [cheering]

1058
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:27,967
JENNIFER: I love you.

1059
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:34,967
[projector whirring]

1060
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,867
[classic movie music playing]

1061
00:40:38,467 --> 00:40:39,467
- [whispering] Nice job.

1062
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:44,300
NARRATOR: When the reindeer
got back to the sleigh,

1063
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:46,734
they were surprised
by what they found.

1064
00:40:46,867 --> 00:40:48,200
There was a young girl

1065
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:50,834
sitting in the middle
of a giant pile of candy canes.

1066
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:54,200
She couldn't have been
more than five years old,

1067
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:55,900
but she was cute as a button.

1068
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:58,133
- Oh! Oh, my gosh! Oh! Oh!

1069
00:40:58,266 --> 00:41:01,166
Get out! [screams]

1070
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,367
- What happened?

1071
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,900
- Your popcorn machine
caught fire.

1072
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:08,400
Wow. That was a lot.

1073
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:10,533
- [electricity crackles]
- [film slows]

1074
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:12,600
[patrons groan]

1075
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,767
- Folks, I'm sorry.

1076
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,767
Uh, sorry.
It's really a mess up here.

1077
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,033
The power's out.

1078
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:23,200
And, um, the film snapped.

1079
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:26,233
And I don't think I'm gonna
get this working again.

1080
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,200
- Not tonight, anyway.
- [grumbling]

1081
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:31,266
- Everybody just turn on
your flashlights.

1082
00:41:35,033 --> 00:41:36,700
- It's so dark in here.

1083
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:52,467
- You okay?

1084
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,500
- Yeah. I guess I just
wanted this to work out

1085
00:41:54,633 --> 00:41:55,900
more than I thought I did.

1086
00:41:56,033 --> 00:41:57,000
- Yeah.

1087
00:41:57,133 --> 00:41:59,333
- Jennifer,
disappointing evening.

1088
00:41:59,467 --> 00:42:00,900
- Well, I suppose so, but...

1089
00:42:01,033 --> 00:42:02,533
- Ah, yeah.
Don't worry about it.

1090
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:04,734
StarMark Cinema will overhaul
the projection system,

1091
00:42:04,867 --> 00:42:06,934
and we'll replace
the popcorn machine.

1092
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,567
- Thank you, Steve.
- Not a problem.

1093
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,700
We'll hash all this out
before the new year.

1094
00:42:10,834 --> 00:42:12,767
StarMark is eager
to start renovations.

1095
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,734
- We'll be in touch. Steve.

1096
00:42:18,533 --> 00:42:19,700
- I'm sorry, guys.

1097
00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:21,333
- [sirens blaring]
- The movie didn't work.

1098
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:23,433
I'm pretty sure
half the townsfolk

1099
00:42:23,567 --> 00:42:25,033
are still frozen
in their seats, and...

1100
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:26,333
[firetruck horn honks]

1101
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:28,467
and the fire department
is arriving.

1102
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,066
[horn honks]

1103
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,333
- Honey, we all
need to let this place go.

1104
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:36,333
Okay?

1105
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:37,633
[brakes hiss]

1106
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:39,567
Come on, babe.

1107
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,867
- Yeah.
- All right, gentlemen...

1108
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,734
- [firefighters chatting]
- [doors close]

1109
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:48,433
- [sighs]

1110
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:50,467
I don't want to let it go.

1111
00:42:51,533 --> 00:42:52,667
- I know.

1112
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:07,533
- I think that I was
so excited for everybody else,

1113
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:09,333
that I didn't realize
how much I wanted

1114
00:43:09,467 --> 00:43:10,867
one more Christmas
at the Madison.

1115
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,300
Last night was...

1116
00:43:12,433 --> 00:43:13,900
not what I was hoping for.

1117
00:43:14,033 --> 00:43:15,600
- Honey, it's the thought
that counts.

1118
00:43:15,734 --> 00:43:18,600
- Whatever happens
with the theater will happen.

1119
00:43:18,734 --> 00:43:22,266
For now, let's...let's just enjoy
our Christmas together, hmm?

1120
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,233
- [cell phone buzzing]
- Oh. Would you excuse me?

1121
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:26,767
- That's Umber and Sprig.
- Mm-hmm.

1122
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,100
- Victoria? Hi.

1123
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,834
What?

1124
00:43:33,967 --> 00:43:34,834
[phone line rings]

1125
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:36,400
MEG: Jennifer! Hi!

1126
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:38,400
- Meg?
- So, um...

1127
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:39,867
how was the Madison?

1128
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,266
- It was 10 degrees inside.

1129
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,667
And the projector broke.

1130
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,467
Also there was a small fire.

1131
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,100
And then
I got a call from Victoria,

1132
00:43:48,233 --> 00:43:51,400
my now former head chef,
who I'm happy for,

1133
00:43:51,533 --> 00:43:53,633
- but also what...
- Oh, yes.

1134
00:43:53,767 --> 00:43:55,834
Yes, Vic...
I was supposed to call you.

1135
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,533
- You should have called, Meg.
- And I didn't.

1136
00:43:57,667 --> 00:43:59,767
I didn't call you, because...

1137
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,367
Joe wouldn't let me.

1138
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,667
- What? Are you kidding?

1139
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,567
- [laughs] I'm kidding.

1140
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,233
I'm totally kidding.
Of course I'm kidding.

1141
00:44:06,367 --> 00:44:08,600
He actually wanted to call you,
and I wouldn't let him

1142
00:44:08,734 --> 00:44:10,934
because of, um, the Madison.

1143
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:12,900
- All right, let's just talk
about this when I get back.

1144
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:14,200
For now,
just tell everybody that...

1145
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:15,934
- You're coming back here?
- Well, yeah.

1146
00:44:16,066 --> 00:44:17,667
I have to help find a head chef,

1147
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,867
and I have to check
on the Christmas party

1148
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,233
and make sure the staff is okay

1149
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,867
with everything
that's changing right now.

1150
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,166
- Oh, no, you know what?
Joe has a lead on a chef,

1151
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,400
and the lead is, uh...

1152
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,967
uh, Jesse Collins.

1153
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,100
- The grilled cheese guy?

1154
00:44:33,233 --> 00:44:35,333
- Yes,
with the Michelin asterisks.

1155
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:36,333
Number signs.

1156
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:37,300
I mean stars.

1157
00:44:37,433 --> 00:44:39,300
[laughs] They're little stars.

1158
00:44:39,433 --> 00:44:40,600
Anyway, he's the best.

1159
00:44:40,734 --> 00:44:43,367
So we're gonna, you know,
see what happens.

1160
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,500
We got this.

1161
00:44:44,633 --> 00:44:47,734
So tell me, um,
more about the Madison.

1162
00:44:47,867 --> 00:44:50,734
- Well...[sighs]
The popcorn machine caught fire,

1163
00:44:50,867 --> 00:44:53,000
and then the projector
went out after five minutes

1164
00:44:53,133 --> 00:44:54,000
and killed the electric.

1165
00:44:54,133 --> 00:44:55,800
- Oh, no. That sounds...

1166
00:44:55,934 --> 00:44:57,133
- terrible.
- Terrible, yes.

1167
00:44:57,266 --> 00:44:58,266
- And a little bit funny?

1168
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,266
- Look, you know what?

1169
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,633
Even so, I loved it.

1170
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:04,700
[laughs] And Simon loved it.

1171
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:07,734
But the only buyer
that Mom and Dad can find

1172
00:45:07,867 --> 00:45:09,700
is StarMark Cinemas.

1173
00:45:09,834 --> 00:45:12,233
It's gonna be so hard
to let that theater go.

1174
00:45:12,367 --> 00:45:15,400
- Oh, well, maybe you should
stay there a little bit longer,

1175
00:45:15,533 --> 00:45:17,467
you know, while you can.

1176
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,400
'Cause we've totally
got this handled here,

1177
00:45:20,533 --> 00:45:21,633
like 100%.

1178
00:45:21,767 --> 00:45:25,433
- Okay, but the second
anything else goes wrong,

1179
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:27,100
you have got to call me.

1180
00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:28,300
- Of course. Obviously.

1181
00:45:28,433 --> 00:45:29,533
[laughs]

1182
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:30,500
I love you.

1183
00:45:30,633 --> 00:45:31,734
- I love you, too.

1184
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:33,967
[snorts] Bye.

1185
00:45:38,867 --> 00:45:40,333
- You're doing a good thing,
Jennifer,

1186
00:45:40,467 --> 00:45:43,967
giving Meg a chance to be away,
heal a little.

1187
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,433
- Mm, thank you.

1188
00:45:45,567 --> 00:45:47,500
- And I wasn't eavesdropping.
- [chuckles]

1189
00:45:47,633 --> 00:45:49,100
- But also
you weren't whispering.

1190
00:45:49,233 --> 00:45:51,400
- True. [sighs]

1191
00:45:51,533 --> 00:45:53,700
- Maybe she's giving you
the same chance,

1192
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,033
helping you be here.

1193
00:45:56,033 --> 00:45:58,233
Maybe this time can be...

1194
00:45:58,367 --> 00:46:00,767
healing for you, too,
if you let it.

1195
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,100
- Yeah.

1196
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,467
- Hey.

1197
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,800
- Hey. What, are you just, uh,

1198
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:10,333
walking through town
with a ladder?

1199
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:11,633
- Your mom asked
if I'd swing by

1200
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:13,734
and help hang some garland,
replace some bulbs.

1201
00:46:13,867 --> 00:46:14,800
- Oh.

1202
00:46:16,867 --> 00:46:18,200
- You know, if I could,

1203
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:21,166
I'd freeze Hazelwood in time
just like it is right now.

1204
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,166
- I would, too.

1205
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,567
Except you know what I'd do?

1206
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,367
I would build a kitchen
in that gigantic basement,

1207
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,033
you know, so you could
see a movie and have dinner,

1208
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:30,467
maybe even a glass of wine.

1209
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,567
- Ah, town's never had
anything like that before.

1210
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,667
- No, it'd be
everything that I love

1211
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,700
about the Madison
and the restaurant,

1212
00:46:36,834 --> 00:46:37,800
and I'd be home,

1213
00:46:37,934 --> 00:46:39,934
closer to Mom and Dad.

1214
00:46:40,066 --> 00:46:42,166
- So you still think
of Hazelwood as home?

1215
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,000
- Yeah, I guess I do,

1216
00:46:44,133 --> 00:46:46,567
even after all these years
in Salt Lake.

1217
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,100
- Well, you know, you,
uh, might need some help

1218
00:46:51,233 --> 00:46:52,800
getting the permits
through town council.

1219
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:53,934
- I know a guy.
- No.

1220
00:46:54,066 --> 00:46:55,700
I already have
a business to run,

1221
00:46:55,834 --> 00:46:57,800
and my head chef is leaving.

1222
00:46:57,934 --> 00:47:01,266
Opening a kitchen
in a movie theater

1223
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,934
on top of the theater upgrades,
that's...

1224
00:47:04,066 --> 00:47:05,600
- That's an ambitious plan.

1225
00:47:05,734 --> 00:47:06,934
Be hard to do it alone.

1226
00:47:07,066 --> 00:47:09,467
- Yeah. And besides,
Simon and I have a whole life

1227
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,166
we have to get back to soon.

1228
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:13,367
- Yeah.

1229
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,800
It's too bad.

1230
00:47:14,934 --> 00:47:16,800
This has been really fun.

1231
00:47:17,867 --> 00:47:19,233
Listen, would you and Simon

1232
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:20,433
like to come over tonight?

1233
00:47:20,567 --> 00:47:22,166
Madzie and I
got these ornament kits,

1234
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,000
- and we'd love it...
- We'd love to.

1235
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:27,600
I mean, it's hard
to say no to Madzie.

1236
00:47:27,734 --> 00:47:29,300
- No.

1237
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:30,900
Good.

1238
00:47:31,033 --> 00:47:32,266
- Thanks for helping.

1239
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,667
- Sure. I'll see you later.

1240
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,166
- Okay.

1241
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,266
- [chuckles]

1242
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,400
- Hey. How's it going in here?

1243
00:47:40,533 --> 00:47:43,033
- Well, um, I swept up
the burned popcorn.

1244
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:45,600
Somebody came by to pick up
the blankets, and, uh,

1245
00:47:45,734 --> 00:47:47,367
oh, a nice old man stopped by

1246
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,633
and had a lot to say
about the boilers and gaskets.

1247
00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:52,033
- [laughs]
Hazelwood loves to help.

1248
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:53,667
- Everybody came
to help last night,

1249
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,266
and they'd all come again
tonight if you wanted them to.

1250
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,266
- You're right about that.

1251
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,166
Clearly they want
one last Christmas here.

1252
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,800
- Clearly. [laughs]

1253
00:48:03,934 --> 00:48:05,667
[camera clicks]

1254
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,333
- Good?

1255
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:10,934
Whew.

1256
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:14,800
So we're agreed?

1257
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,467
We're gonna open one last time.

1258
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,100
- Yeah. Our Christmas present
to the town. Heh.

1259
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,667
["This Christmas" playing]

1260
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,800
- Whoa.
- They're here!

1261
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,667
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

- So word on the street
is that there's

1273
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,066
a cryptic Christmas message
on the Madison marquee.

1274
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,600
- And I was hoping
you could help.

1275
00:48:59,734 --> 00:49:00,734
- Oh, were you?

1276
00:49:00,867 --> 00:49:01,967
- Yeah, because I realized

1277
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,900
that I take on
more than I can handle,

1278
00:49:04,033 --> 00:49:05,567
and you seem to...

1279
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,667
- Really enjoy
making myself useful.

1280
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,700
- Yeah.
- You know,

1281
00:49:08,834 --> 00:49:10,300
I meet the best people that way.

1282
00:49:10,433 --> 00:49:11,200
- You do?
- I do.

1283
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:12,967
- I'll take that as a yes.

1284
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,533
- I didn't say yes.
- [laughs]

1285
00:49:14,667 --> 00:49:16,467
- But I'll do it.
- Really?

1286
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,333
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1287
00:49:18,467 --> 00:49:19,500
- [laughs]

1288
00:49:20,734 --> 00:49:22,333
- [laughs]

1289
00:49:27,233 --> 00:49:29,133
- Make sure you add
just a little more sugar.

1290
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:30,433
- Okay, got it.

1291
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:32,934
By the way, I tried
every single one of the keys,

1292
00:49:33,066 --> 00:49:35,367
and not one of them
unlocked the crying room.

1293
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,433
- Did you try
above the door frame?

1294
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,633
- No.
- Dave's habit.

1295
00:49:39,767 --> 00:49:43,266
[laughs] It took us forever
to find all the keys.

1296
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,467
- Okay.
- [laughs]

1297
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,633
- Christmas cheer
in cookie-dough form.

1298
00:49:47,767 --> 00:49:49,400
You run a solid operation.

1299
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:51,333
- [laughs]
Well, you know the drill.

1300
00:49:51,467 --> 00:49:52,633
We have to have enough

1301
00:49:52,767 --> 00:49:54,767
for the Christmas tree lighting
tomorrow night.

1302
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,500
- Well, it smells amazing.

1303
00:49:56,633 --> 00:49:58,500
Makes me wish we'd come home
for Christmas sooner

1304
00:49:58,633 --> 00:49:59,734
- all these years.
- Mm-hmm.

1305
00:49:59,867 --> 00:50:01,667
- Well, it's never too late.
I mean,

1306
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,967
that's the best part
about a Christmas tradition.

1307
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,133
There's always next year, too.

1308
00:50:05,266 --> 00:50:06,567
- Yes, there is.

1309
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,133
- Oh, guys, I have to got
to get these over to the church.

1310
00:50:09,266 --> 00:50:10,467
Do you two want to join me?

1311
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,600
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1312
00:50:11,734 --> 00:50:13,100
- All right,
let's wrap this up,

1313
00:50:13,233 --> 00:50:14,100
and then we'll head over.

1314
00:50:14,233 --> 00:50:15,934
- So do you bake cookies

1315
00:50:16,066 --> 00:50:17,567
for all of these
meal deliveries?

1316
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,000
- Honey, we've been
donating cookies for years.

1317
00:50:20,133 --> 00:50:21,166
- Wow.
- Did you want to help

1318
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,400
do some of the drop-offs?

1319
00:50:22,533 --> 00:50:23,467
- Yeah, sure.

1320
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,934
- We...We usually do it in pairs.

1321
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:26,900
Morning, Eric.

1322
00:50:27,033 --> 00:50:28,700
- I could use a partner.

1323
00:50:28,834 --> 00:50:29,967
- Oh. [laughs]

1324
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,433
Yeah, great.

1325
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,133
- Eric, hello.

1326
00:50:37,133 --> 00:50:39,533
[gasps] Oh, my goodness.

1327
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:41,333
It's Jennifer Swift.

1328
00:50:41,467 --> 00:50:43,266
- It's good to see you again,
Mrs. Heller.

1329
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,734
It's been so long.

1330
00:50:44,867 --> 00:50:46,734
What happened to your foot?
Are you okay?

1331
00:50:46,867 --> 00:50:47,934
- Oh, don't worry about me.

1332
00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:50,033
I'll be dancing up
a storm in no time.

1333
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:51,700
- [both chuckle]
- And I've heard

1334
00:50:51,834 --> 00:50:53,867
you'll both be caroling again
this year.

1335
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,500
- We will, yes.
Brought you this.

1336
00:50:56,633 --> 00:50:58,233
- Thank you.
- Can we help you with that?

1337
00:50:58,367 --> 00:51:00,400
- No, no. No, I got it.

1338
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:02,333
- Okay. Bye.

1339
00:51:02,467 --> 00:51:03,433
- See you, Mary.

1340
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,300
ERIC: I want
to show you something.

1341
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:07,367
- Okay.

1342
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,934
[sighs] The old sledding hill.

1343
00:51:12,066 --> 00:51:14,367
I used to come here
all the time.

1344
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,433
- Yeah? I still do.

1345
00:51:16,567 --> 00:51:18,200
- Really?
- Yeah.

1346
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:19,500
It's a great place to sit

1347
00:51:19,633 --> 00:51:21,000
- and just think things through.
- Yeah.

1348
00:51:21,133 --> 00:51:22,834
- It's where I decided
to run for city council.

1349
00:51:22,967 --> 00:51:24,166
- Really?
- Yeah.

1350
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,834
It's where I compose
all my best arguments

1351
00:51:25,967 --> 00:51:28,834
for preserving the history
of the buildings downtown.

1352
00:51:28,967 --> 00:51:31,667
You know, I would absolutely

1353
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,633
take Madzie
to a movie-theater restaurant.

1354
00:51:33,767 --> 00:51:36,233
- Hmm. Even without
crunching the numbers,

1355
00:51:36,367 --> 00:51:39,834
I know it's not really prac...

1356
00:51:39,967 --> 00:51:42,433
- What's this?
- I got some design skills.

1357
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:45,133
- Oh. You sketched
my Madison kitchen?

1358
00:51:45,266 --> 00:51:46,734
- Yeah, well, you said
the basement would work,

1359
00:51:46,867 --> 00:51:48,867
and it occurred to me
it's a really good idea.

1360
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,934
- Yeah, except for the part

1361
00:51:50,066 --> 00:51:51,300
where I fire up
a second business

1362
00:51:51,433 --> 00:51:53,100
and get so busy
I never see my kid.

1363
00:51:53,233 --> 00:51:54,433
- Mm, there's that.
- But...

1364
00:51:54,567 --> 00:51:55,467
[cell phone buzzing]

1365
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,767
- Oh. Simon.

1366
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,834
- On cue.
- Simon?

1367
00:51:59,967 --> 00:52:01,300
- [indistinct]
- Yeah?

1368
00:52:01,433 --> 00:52:04,400
- What? Wait. Wait. Wait.
Slow down. I can't...

1369
00:52:04,533 --> 00:52:05,934
Yeah. Of course.

1370
00:52:06,066 --> 00:52:07,734
Like, yeah,
I'll be right there.

1371
00:52:07,867 --> 00:52:08,900
- Bye.

1372
00:52:09,033 --> 00:52:10,467
- Um...[laughs]

1373
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,767
Can you drop me off
at the theater?

1374
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,433
- Yeah, of course.
Everything okay?

1375
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:14,867
- Yeah, he said it's...

1376
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,367
everything's fine,
nothing to be worried about,

1377
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,667
but I have to to see it
to believe it.

1378
00:52:21,667 --> 00:52:23,467
So I'll see
you and Madzie later?

1379
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,000
My mom wanted to invite you guys
to the ornament exchange.

1380
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:27,200
- Yeah. Sounds great.
Wouldn't miss it.

1381
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:29,000
I have a few things
I have to go over

1382
00:52:29,133 --> 00:52:30,567
with your parents
about the theater sale anyway.

1383
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,734
- Right. Okay.

1384
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:36,900
Hey, um, thank you for today.

1385
00:52:37,033 --> 00:52:38,734
That was fun.

1386
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:40,333
- It was fun.

1387
00:52:40,467 --> 00:52:42,100
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

1388
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,600
- Guess what.
- What is going on?

1389
00:52:44,734 --> 00:52:46,533
So you know how
Nan and Pop, they told me

1390
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:48,200
to check the door frame
for the keys, right?

1391
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:51,266
So I checked. I found the keys.
And then when I opened the door.

1392
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:56,567
- Whoa.

1393
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,567
- Yeah.

1394
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,867
- It's top of the line.

1395
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,433
Ah, I'd been telling
your Uncle Dave for years

1396
00:53:03,567 --> 00:53:06,467
to get a new projector
for this place, and he did.

1397
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,600
- All right, so if we're
gonna get the whole town

1398
00:53:09,734 --> 00:53:11,600
back in here for a movie,

1399
00:53:11,734 --> 00:53:13,700
how hard is it gonna be
to set all this...

1400
00:53:13,834 --> 00:53:16,367
- I won't know
until I get in there.

1401
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,800
But do you know how long

1402
00:53:17,934 --> 00:53:20,567
I've wanted to play
with one of these things?

1403
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,867
If you'd let me, I...

1404
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,900
- I mean, I'd help.
I really wanna help.

1405
00:53:24,033 --> 00:53:26,734
- The theater kids geek out
over stuff like this.

1406
00:53:26,867 --> 00:53:27,900
We'd have helpers.

1407
00:53:28,033 --> 00:53:31,367
- Well, I think
we have to try, right?

1408
00:53:34,967 --> 00:53:36,600
- ...but you're
going to be giving this.

1409
00:53:36,734 --> 00:53:38,000
- Oh, Jennifer, hi.
- Hi.

1410
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:39,667
- We're just about
to drop off the contracts

1411
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,867
- for your parents to look over.
- Okay. Thanks.

1412
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,233
- Looks like you're
giving movie night another try.

1413
00:53:44,367 --> 00:53:46,767
- Yeah. Well,
we can't promise heat,

1414
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,633
but we just couldn't let it go.

1415
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,467
- Well,
you're just in time, too,

1416
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,300
'cause they're pushing to close
the sale by the end of the year.

1417
00:53:53,433 --> 00:53:54,734
- Okay.
- Now listen.

1418
00:53:54,867 --> 00:53:57,133
I know you had your hopes pinned
on preserving the place,

1419
00:53:57,266 --> 00:53:59,467
but usually when they buy
an old theater like this,

1420
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,967
they do a complete renovation.

1421
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,700
They wouldn't put preservation
in the contract.

1422
00:54:03,834 --> 00:54:06,667
I'm sorry. I-I really did try.

1423
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,033
- I appreciate that, Steve.
Thank you.

1424
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:13,133
Well, I hope you'll both
still join us for movie night.

1425
00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:14,900
- We wouldn't miss it
for the world, right?

1426
00:54:15,033 --> 00:54:16,100
- I'll be there.
- Bye.

1427
00:54:16,233 --> 00:54:18,200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1428
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:23,133
- [sighs]

1429
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,100
- Listen up.

1430
00:54:25,233 --> 00:54:26,700
True to family custom,

1431
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:28,667
this is how it works, okay?

1432
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,066
You display your ornament,

1433
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,967
and then you tell us
what significance it has,

1434
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,600
and then you choose someone
to put it on the tree for you.

1435
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:37,533
- All right. I'll go first.
- Okay.

1436
00:54:37,667 --> 00:54:38,533
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

1437
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:43,033
Ah. Uh, my big brother Dave

1438
00:54:43,166 --> 00:54:45,633
wore this watch for years.

1439
00:54:47,066 --> 00:54:52,066
And since this is
my first Christmas without him,

1440
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,100
I wanted to mark the time.

1441
00:54:55,233 --> 00:54:56,467
[laughs]

1442
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,300
And so I had it
made into an ornament.

1443
00:54:59,433 --> 00:55:02,266
- Hmm.
- Um...

1444
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,533
Simon.

1445
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:04,834
Would you do the honors?

1446
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:06,166
- Of course.

1447
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,433
- [laughs]

1448
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,734
POP: All right. Good job.

1449
00:55:19,867 --> 00:55:22,967
- Now it's my turn.
- Okay.

1450
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,467
- My darling...

1451
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:29,367
now that we have decided to take
the trip to California...

1452
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,500
- Yay.
- [laughs]

1453
00:55:31,633 --> 00:55:32,900
- I got you this.

1454
00:55:33,033 --> 00:55:34,467
- Oh, honey.

1455
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,967
- [laughs]

1456
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,800
- [laughs]

1457
00:55:38,934 --> 00:55:40,033
- You do it.

1458
00:55:40,166 --> 00:55:41,967
- Really?
- Yes.

1459
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,734
- Oh, I'm so excited.

1460
00:55:45,867 --> 00:55:50,300
I'm gonna...
Well, I think right there.

1461
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:51,734
- Hey, you okay?

1462
00:55:51,867 --> 00:55:53,533
[Nan laughs]

1463
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:55,967
- Sometimes Christmas is sad.

1464
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,333
Your grandma misses her brother.

1465
00:55:59,667 --> 00:56:01,166
I miss my mom.

1466
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:06,900
Yeah, I miss my dad, too,
more at Christmastime.

1467
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:11,200
You know, he used to have
the loudest laugh in every room.

1468
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:14,433
- I just know
she'd really like this.

1469
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,533
- You know what?
I really miss my dad.

1470
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:22,934
It helps me to just imagine
that he's right here with me.

1471
00:56:23,066 --> 00:56:24,066
- I do that, too.

1472
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,367
- I think we all do.

1473
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,767
- Because I enjoy
making myself useful,

1474
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,667
I have a toolkit.

1475
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,200
- [whoops]
- [laughs]

1476
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:34,667
- Seemed appropriate.

1477
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,333
And, Jen, since you're the one
I like to be useful for,

1478
00:56:37,467 --> 00:56:39,066
would you hang that, please?

1479
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,266
- Sure. I'd love to.

1480
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,867
Okay, gotta find the right spot.

1481
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,433
- Let's see.

1482
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,734
[chuckles]

1483
00:56:49,133 --> 00:56:50,200
- Here we go.
- Yeah.

1484
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:52,200
- It's perfect.
- All right. Yeah.

1485
00:57:05,567 --> 00:57:07,000
- So that's it?

1486
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:09,734
- Another couple adjustments,

1487
00:57:09,867 --> 00:57:11,700
but then yeah.

1488
00:57:11,834 --> 00:57:13,867
Pretty much.

1489
00:57:15,233 --> 00:57:16,934
- [laughter]

1490
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:18,467
- Well, it's...

1491
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,333
DAVE: Oh, this is fantastic.

1492
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:22,333
- [piano playing]
- Unbelievable.

1493
00:57:22,467 --> 00:57:24,000
- What?

1494
00:57:24,133 --> 00:57:26,066
DAVE: Come on.
You guys are amazing.

1495
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,567
You move so well together.

1496
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,567
[piano playing on film]

1497
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,667
DAVE: See? I told you.

1498
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,233
That's what I'm talking about.

1499
00:57:41,367 --> 00:57:43,767
Yes. Yes.

1500
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,100
Yeah, timing.

1501
00:57:45,233 --> 00:57:47,166
- I mean,
it looks focused to me.

1502
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:50,133
VALERIE:
Is it bright enough to...

1503
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:52,633
Oh, hello down there.

1504
00:57:52,767 --> 00:57:53,900
What do you think?

1505
00:57:54,033 --> 00:57:55,200
- What is this?

1506
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:58,100
- Uncle Dave got these
old family movies digitized,

1507
00:57:58,233 --> 00:58:00,433
so I found 'em
on an old hard drive.

1508
00:58:03,533 --> 00:58:05,066
- [squeals]
- Whoa!

1509
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,700
- [laughs]

1510
00:58:06,834 --> 00:58:08,800
- The joke about the chopsticks?

1511
00:58:08,934 --> 00:58:09,900
That's a good one, isn't it?

1512
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:11,166
- Come on back, kids.

1513
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:14,166
Those two will let us know
if it goes sideways.

1514
00:58:15,667 --> 00:58:17,000
- Hey, hey, look. Here's, uh...

1515
00:58:17,133 --> 00:58:18,700
- Oh.
- One of our...one of our quilts.

1516
00:58:18,834 --> 00:58:20,567
- There we go.
- That's good.

1517
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,233
- DAVE: Oh, you got me.
- ERIC: Better?

1518
00:58:22,367 --> 00:58:25,834
- Oh, I'm so excited
to get everybody back in here.

1519
00:58:25,967 --> 00:58:28,633
- Yeah. I had my first kiss
right over there.

1520
00:58:28,767 --> 00:58:29,800
- Did you, really?
- Yeah.

1521
00:58:29,934 --> 00:58:31,400
During a showing
of, uh, Scrooged.

1522
00:58:31,533 --> 00:58:34,166
- [laughs] Who was it?
- I'll tell if you will.

1523
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,900
- Oh, please.
I never kissed anyone here.

1524
00:58:36,033 --> 00:58:37,266
My Uncle Dave
was always upstairs.

1525
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,333
- Right.
- I didn't.

1526
00:58:39,467 --> 00:58:40,767
- Oh, whatever you say.

1527
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,200
- I'm actually kind of jealous.

1528
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:44,400
- Eh, don't be.
It was very awkward.

1529
00:58:44,533 --> 00:58:46,100
- [chuckles]

1530
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,533
- Plus I had a crush
on another girl.

1531
00:58:49,667 --> 00:58:51,266
- Who?

1532
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:56,367
- Y-You really...You didn't know?

1533
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,567
- That was...
- Wow.

1534
00:59:20,734 --> 00:59:25,000
- So it was my first kiss
at the Madison.

1535
00:59:25,133 --> 00:59:26,834
[chuckles]

1536
00:59:26,967 --> 00:59:28,300
- I'm glad.

1537
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,834
- Daddy!
- Hey.

1538
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,400
Uh, Madzie, you're...

1539
00:59:33,533 --> 00:59:34,834
- Hi.
- Uh...

1540
00:59:34,967 --> 00:59:36,333
hey, kiddo.

1541
00:59:36,467 --> 00:59:39,233
- Uh, I'm gonna
go check the projector.

1542
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:40,433
- Yeah. Eh...

1543
00:59:41,467 --> 00:59:43,433
hey, come here. [chuckles]

1544
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,300
- You know, it's too bad
you don't live here.

1545
00:59:59,433 --> 01:00:01,500
We could use more boys

1717
01:07:04,533 --> 01:07:06,834
I get that you're trying to
figure out what's next for us.

1718
01:07:06,967 --> 01:07:09,567
And, I mean, if we have
to go back to Salt Lake

1719
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,100
and this is all
just a really good dream,

1720
01:07:12,233 --> 01:07:14,800
that's fine. I just...

1721
01:07:14,934 --> 01:07:17,166
I really want to do
this movie tomorrow.

1722
01:07:19,133 --> 01:07:20,667
- Okay.

1723
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,400
All right, well, I'll just...
I'll turn around,

1724
01:07:22,533 --> 01:07:26,033
and I'll come right back as soon
as I get everything in order.

1725
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:27,000
I love you.

1726
01:07:27,133 --> 01:07:28,300
- I love you, too.

1727

JENNIFER: Thank you.

1728
01:07:36,433 --> 01:07:37,567
- You're welcome.

1729
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,934
- [sighs] This place
really does look amazing.

1730
01:07:40,066 --> 01:07:42,767
- Your sister,
she's a force of nature.

1731
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,300
- Isn't she?

1732
01:07:44,433 --> 01:07:46,367
[sighs] This whole drive back,

1733
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:49,300
I just kept thinking
of all the things I left

1734
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:51,066
for somebody else to do.

1735
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,400
- Well, Joe and Meg
are a great team.

1736
01:07:53,533 --> 01:07:54,867
- Yeah.
- And wait 'til you see

1737
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,100
the plans for the party.
Think you'll be impressed

1738
01:07:57,233 --> 01:07:59,033
with how we all pulled together.

1739
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:00,567
- Thank you.

1740
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:02,467
- [door opens]
- Jen!

1741
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:05,333
Jen! We have a solution!

1742
01:08:05,467 --> 01:08:08,433
- You found a chef?
- We found a lead on a chef.

1743
01:08:08,567 --> 01:08:09,700
- Get your coat.

1744
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:20,667
- Hey, all.
- Hi.

1745
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,333
- Wait. You're...
You're Jennifer Swift.

1746
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:24,600
- Y-Yeah. [laughs]

1747
01:08:24,734 --> 01:08:27,200
- Wow. Okay.
Uh, your article last year

1748
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:30,767
in Great Salt about hospitality
and community building,

1749
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,700
- like, that...
- Yeah?

1750
01:08:32,834 --> 01:08:35,266
- that is always what I've
believed restaurants could be.

1751
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,467
- Wow. Well, thank you.
Thank you so much.

1752
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,867
- That's...
- Of course.

1753
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,867
- Um, we'll each have
one of everything, please.

1754
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,400
- Amazing.

1755
01:08:43,533 --> 01:08:45,166
Um, you know what?
I'm gonna get you guys

1756
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,667
my last three
red velvet doughnuts.

1757
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,500
- Mmm.
- And you're in luck,

1758
01:08:49,633 --> 01:08:51,633
because they usually sell out.

1759
01:08:51,767 --> 01:08:54,934
- Wow. I like your confidence.
Those look amazing.

1760
01:08:55,066 --> 01:08:56,333
Well, we'll have to see, though,

1761
01:08:56,467 --> 01:08:58,100
because our dad
makes a mean red velvet...

1762
01:08:58,233 --> 01:09:00,133
- Well, anything.
- Anything. Yeah.

1763
01:09:00,266 --> 01:09:01,233

- Oh, wow!
- Mm-hmm.

1766
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:08,834
- You know,
I would go here every day.

1767
01:09:08,967 --> 01:09:10,200
- It's good.
- Yeah.

1768
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:13,367
- Joe, what do you think?
Does this wow you?

1769
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,533
- I just worry, because he
works at a food stand.

1770
01:09:16,667 --> 01:09:18,934
You know, it's different
kind of volume.

1771
01:09:19,066 --> 01:09:20,633
- Mm-hmm.
- But...

1772
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:22,433
it is very good.

1773
01:09:22,567 --> 01:09:24,400
- Mm-hmm.

1774
01:09:24,533 --> 01:09:25,667
- You know what?

1775
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,967
We need someone immediately.

1776
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,233
I say let's do it.
Let's make him an offer.

1777
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:31,467
- Yeah?

1778
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,100
- [laughs]

1779
01:09:33,233 --> 01:09:36,133
- This is a really good space.
- It is.

1780
01:09:37,166 --> 01:09:40,967
- [sighs]
- [both laugh]

1781
01:09:42,567 --> 01:09:45,033
- Yeah, I come here every year

1782
01:09:45,166 --> 01:09:47,734
- when the holidays get nutty.
- Mm-hmm.

1783
01:09:47,867 --> 01:09:49,967
- Simon loves it, too,
but he won't admit it.

1784
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,734
This year, all he's into
is the Madison.

1785
01:09:52,867 --> 01:09:54,867
- So they're really gonna
turn it into a multiplex?

1786
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,433
- Well, the only way
to preserve the history

1787
01:09:57,567 --> 01:09:59,033
is to keep it in the family.

1788
01:09:59,166 --> 01:10:01,100
- Hmm.

1789
01:10:01,233 --> 01:10:03,567
- Simon wants us
to move there and run it.

1790
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:06,567
- Is that what you want, too?

1791
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:09,166
- I don't see
how we could possibly do that.

1792
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,767
I don't have the kind
of money that it would take.

1793
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,734
- Well, why don't I take
the money that I was gonna use

1794
01:10:14,867 --> 01:10:17,133
- to go to France and give it...
- No. Nope. No way.

1795
01:10:17,266 --> 01:10:20,200
You save that money
for your next step.

1796
01:10:20,333 --> 01:10:21,633
- Whatever that is.

1797
01:10:23,133 --> 01:10:24,767
[blows lips] Well...

1798
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:27,000
if this is the last Christmas
at the Madison,

1799
01:10:27,133 --> 01:10:30,400
I want to spend every
single minute celebrating it.

1800
01:10:30,533 --> 01:10:32,500
- You're gonna be there?
- Of course I'm gonna be there.

1801
01:10:32,633 --> 01:10:35,033
I wouldn't miss it.
I will even be on time.

1802
01:10:35,166 --> 01:10:37,967
- Oh, you won't,
but I appreciate the offer.

1803
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,066
- [laughs]

Turns out Meg had a solution

1808
01:10:53,533 --> 01:10:55,433
I never even would have
thought of on my own.

1809
01:10:55,567 --> 01:10:57,100
- Ah, well,
we know that feeling.

1810
01:10:57,233 --> 01:10:59,700
We're gonna miss her
when she goes off to France.

1811
01:10:59,834 --> 01:11:01,333
- Yeah.
- Sure won't be the same

1812
01:11:01,467 --> 01:11:03,433
- around here.
- Listen, Jennifer.

1813
01:11:03,567 --> 01:11:06,667
Steve delivered the paperwork
for the Madison today.

1814
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,033
We're supposed to close the sale
before New Year's.

1815
01:11:09,166 --> 01:11:12,133
- Oh. But I thought
with everything that we've done

1816
01:11:12,266 --> 01:11:13,367
- and learned...
- I know. I know.

1817
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:16,233
I'm sorry. But I
have spent so much time

1818
01:11:16,367 --> 01:11:18,300
letting the Madison go.

1819
01:11:18,433 --> 01:11:20,667
I'm just not really sure
my heart can take it.

1820
01:11:22,033 --> 01:11:23,166
- It's okay. We understand.

1821
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:24,500
- Please don't think

1822
01:11:24,633 --> 01:11:26,667
that I'm not excited
about tomorrow night.

1823
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,967
I-I really can't wait.

1824

found it
in the projection booth,

couldn't have the actual thing,

1868

that maybe we could give
this one some new life.

you know, my brother.

1872
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:56,367

when you least expected it,

1873

he would say or do
something so kind.

in the village.

did some shopping recently,

maybe they helped out.

01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:32,033
Oh, I love you.

2060
01:22:32,166 --> 01:22:33,400
- Love you. Come on.

2061
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:36,567
- I'm so glad you guys came.

2062
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:39,000
- Yeah.
- It was good, right?

2063
01:22:39,133 --> 01:22:40,533
Yeah, of course.

2064
01:22:40,667 --> 01:22:42,100
- Good night. Bye.

2065
01:22:42,233 --> 01:22:43,166
- Bye.
- Bye.

2066
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:44,767
- Oh, it's freezing.
- I know.

2067
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:46,633
- Oh. Bye.

2068
01:22:46,767 --> 01:22:48,033

2069
01:22:50,567 --> 01:22:51,834
- So...

2070
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,600
- [laughs]
- So...

2071
01:22:53,734 --> 01:22:55,867
- So...
- [chuckles]

2072
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,633
- You know, I've got
those, uh, kitchen designs.

2073
01:22:59,767 --> 01:23:01,700
- Do you?
- If you want 'em.

2074
01:23:01,834 --> 01:23:04,066
As long as they conform
to the original.

2075
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:07,266
- It's very important that we
preserve the historic...

2076
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,667
- Very, very, very important.

2077
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:14,500
- Hmm. You sure you're ready
to build the kitchen with me?

2078
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,233
- I'm on your team
if you're on mine.

2079
01:23:18,367 --> 01:23:21,800
- Everybody always said
we'd be unstoppable.
