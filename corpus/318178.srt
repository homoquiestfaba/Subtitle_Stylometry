JESSICA: How are the numbers?

00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:41,086
MARTIN: Incredible.

3
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:45,477
(CHUCKLES) Absolutely incredible.

4
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:49,605
Congratulations.

5
00:00:51,447 --> 00:00:53,005
I'm leaving you.

6
00:00:56,887 --> 00:00:58,923
Did you hear what I said?

7
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:00,839
I'm leaving you.

8
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:03,277
Yeah, I heard. Yeah. Yeah.

9
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:08,202
- I'm not kidding.
- I know.

10
00:01:12,247 --> 00:01:15,557
Look, I think
it's an excellent decision on your part.

11
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:17,801
You do?

12
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:21,004
You're a fantastic person,

13
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:25,561
and the last year's been great, really.

14
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:28,125
You're beautiful.

15
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:30,564
The sex has been wonderful.

16
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:32,763
You're kind and supportive.

17
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:36,477
You wait for me with dinner
when I work late, you're amazing.

18
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:39,877
And it's driving me out of my fucking mind!

19
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:44,476
You know, with numbers like this,

20
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:46,046
this should be the happiest day of my life,

21
00:01:46,127 --> 00:01:50,200
and instead I have to worry about
whether I make you happy all the time!

22
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,165
Jessica, sweetheart,

23
00:01:57,327 --> 00:02:00,160
you make me feel like being a better person.

24
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:02,283
And I'm not a better person.

25
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:05,075
I'm me.

26
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:09,599
I feel sorry for you.

27
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:16,161
Don't.

28
00:02:16,967 --> 00:02:18,639
I certainly don't.

29
00:02:22,087 --> 00:02:24,362
In fact, I envy myself deeply.

30
00:03:32,847 --> 00:03:34,565
- Morning.
- AGENT: Morning.

31
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:40,199
Good morning, Mr President.

32
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,243
And congratulations.

33
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:44,966
It's good to have you with us
for another four years.

34
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:47,686
Thank you, Thomas. It's good to be back.

35
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:51,280
Would you like me to turn on the TV, sir?

36
00:03:53,327 --> 00:03:55,921
Oh, no. That's okay.

38
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:02,001
- How about the paper?
- The paper, sir?

39
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:04,437
Yeah. What the heck?

40
00:04:04,847 --> 00:04:08,317
We'll see what the <i>New York Times</i>
has to say about things.

41
00:04:08,687 --> 00:04:11,121
Bet they're eating some crow this morning.

42
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:13,084
We have a copy anywhere?

43
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:14,600
We can get one, sir.

44
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:18,043
All right, get one.
And scare up my reading glasses.

45
00:04:19,487 --> 00:04:21,762
I'm going to read the newspaper.

46
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:24,237
Shall I bring it to the workout room, sir?

47
00:04:24,327 --> 00:04:27,603
No, I'm gonna read my paper
right here in bed.

48
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:29,724
Take it a little easy this morning.

49
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:31,763
Well, you deserve it, sir.

50
00:04:31,847 --> 00:04:34,520
Yes, I do. It was a heck of a fight.

51
00:04:34,847 --> 00:04:36,724
Yes, sir, a heck of a fight.

52
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:40,197
The important thing is the good guys won.

He's ruining every shot!

You, come here!

61
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:40,364
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Sorry?

62
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:41,516
Is that what you're going to say

63
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,757
when you endanger your brothers
on the holy mission?

64
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:46,156
- No.
- Just stay out of the shot.

65
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,721
Yes, sir.

66
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:52,723
My wife's cousin.
Otherwise, I send him back home tomorrow!

00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:56,085

Let's shoot this puppy!

What is this?

83
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:27,726
Was I being loud?

84
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:30,082
You could hear it down into the valley.

00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:35,760
That was rare.

You are lucky it was me who found you,

88
00:07:37,327 --> 00:07:40,046
not one of the others
because they would cut your throat!

89
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,880
I'm so sorry. I like show tunes.

90
00:07:43,327 --> 00:07:46,956
I grew up listening to them,
my mother had a collection of 50 records.

91
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:49,242
Your mother was killed
by an American bomb.

92
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:50,646
I know that.

93
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:52,839
That is why I'm here.

Look, I've got some news for you.

95
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:57,600
Your papers came through.

96
00:07:57,687 --> 00:08:00,997
You are leaving next week for Frankfurt,
and from there to Orange County.

97
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:04,318
You'll be staying at our mutual cousins'.
They know nothing of your purpose there.

98
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:07,604
You are to just wait
until your sleeper cell contacts you.

99
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,325
When will that be?

100
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:11,882
Never.

101
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:21,685
I can't. I just can't, I can't, I can't.
I can't possibly. I can't do it.

00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:26,001
It's too horrible.
Please, not another season, please.

I beg you, don't make me do it.
Don't make me do it.

- Don't make me do it.
- Everyone's ready for you, sir.

Right, terrific. Okay, let's go!
Let's rock and roll, yeah?

106
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:39,879
Good morning. Good morning, everyone.
Lovely to see you again.

107
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:43,483
Or, rather, not see you.
Can we have the house lights, please?

108
00:08:43,847 --> 00:08:44,962
Now?

109
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:46,722
Now?

110
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:50,121
Not next Tuesday. Cheers. Boo!

111
00:08:50,207 --> 00:08:51,401
ALL: Boo!

112
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:54,326
Here we are again. Here we are, yet again.

113
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:58,401
Here we are, producing
the most popular show on television.

114
00:08:58,487 --> 00:09:02,275
The show to which not only America,
but now the whole world is glued. Yay!

115
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:08,684
Which brings me to the task at hand.

116
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:10,883
When you're on top,
there's only one place to go.

117
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,844
- And where is that?
- Down!

118
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,600
Who said that?

119
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:21,997
"Down" is an incorrect answer.

120
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:26,446
The answer is "up." Up!

121
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:30,515
Because if you go down,
do you know what happens?

122
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:34,919
All those people who were buttering you up
and smiling at you just moments ago

123
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,283
leap on you and kick you and kick you

124
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:41,916
and kick you and kick you
and kick you until you shut up.

125
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,083
Down is not an option.

126
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:51,962
So,

127
00:09:52,807 --> 00:09:56,117
let's go out there
and get some great contestants.

128
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:59,445
And I don't just mean talented,
I mean human.

129
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:04,159
And by human, I mean flawed.
And by flawed, I mean freaks.

130
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:06,119
Bring me some freaks.

131
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:08,756

that even I would watch.

It's just that there is a lot of stuff in here.

It... There's a lot of interesting things.

173
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:06,083
Well, yeah, there is a lot of stuff.
They have to fill the pages with something.

174
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:08,522
But I think "interesting" is stretching it.

00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:55,604
Sir, you are worrying me, here.

345
00:20:55,927 --> 00:20:58,395
I don't know how long I can cover for this.

346
00:20:58,487 --> 00:21:01,923
Well, there is nothing to cover for.

347
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:09,716
I'm just...
I'm just trying to figure out a few things.

348
00:21:09,807 --> 00:21:13,516
If you wanted more info, sir,
why did you cancel the weekly briefings?

349
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:17,919
Because I'm not sure I'm getting
the straight poop from them, that's all.

350
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:20,475
I mean, Iran and North Korea

351
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:23,684
are not just like Dr Octopus and Magneto.

352
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:26,327
You don't like cartoons? Fine, they're gone.

353
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:28,637
Joe, we're trying to help, here.

354
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:32,805
- Linda?
- Well, we were wondering

355
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:36,725
maybe you ought to take some of these.

356
00:21:38,207 --> 00:21:39,845
What, your hormone pills?

357
00:21:39,927 --> 00:21:42,521
They're not hormone pills,
they're happy pills.

358
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:44,837
They make you happy when you're sad.

359
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,122
Well, hold on here.

360
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:53,043
- Are you sad?
- No. I'm happy.

361
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,565
But I think you're a little sad, maybe.

362
00:21:56,927 --> 00:22:00,124
I think maybe you ran so hard,

363
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:04,042
you fought so well
for this wonderful victory,

364
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:08,405
so that you could help your country, and...

365
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:11,606
You fought so well

366
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:14,406
for a wonderful victory.

367
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:18,758
Fought so well
for the wonderful victory that you...

368
00:22:18,847 --> 00:22:22,442
Now you have the wind,
the wind knocked out of you.

369
00:22:22,527 --> 00:22:25,360
You're wondering,
what was the point of it all.

370
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:27,523
Why you? Why now?

371
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:30,924
Why did the Lord pick you out of all people?

372
00:22:31,327 --> 00:22:35,366
What are your special qualifications?
And did the Lord even pick you?

373
00:22:35,447 --> 00:22:38,757
Or was it just having
really, really powerful friends?

374
00:22:39,847 --> 00:22:42,441
Are you saying the Lord didn't pick me?

375
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,802
The Lord did pick you. He picked you.

376
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:47,321
Of course he picked you, honey.

377
00:22:47,687 --> 00:22:51,316
The thing is, we just can't have a President

378
00:22:51,407 --> 00:22:54,001
who stays in his pyjamas all day.

379
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:55,926
Come on, sir.

380
00:22:57,007 --> 00:22:58,804
The country needs you.

381
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:01,685
I like the country.

382
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:05,642
Well, that's good.
Because you're its President.

383
00:23:25,127 --> 00:23:27,766
- Hello, William.
- Hi, Mrs Kendoo.

384
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:31,238
I just came by to say good-bye to Sally.

385
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:34,283
Well, have you up and joined the Army?

386
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,560
I have, Mrs Kendoo.

387
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,318
I just feel like since Sally dumped me,
my life has been meaningless.

388
00:23:41,407 --> 00:23:44,717
So, I'm trying to find meaning
by defending my country.

389
00:23:45,487 --> 00:23:48,206
And I just wanted to tell Sally that.

390
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:51,843
Well, William, that's very sincere of you,

391
00:23:53,287 --> 00:23:54,879
but Sally isn't here.

392
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:58,004
She's in New York meeting with agents.

393
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:01,400
- Agents?
- They're folks that...

394
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:06,962
They act greedy and mean for you,
so you can seem like a nice person.

395
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:09,357
But Sally is a nice person.

396
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:14,365
So I'm not gonna get to see her, then, am I?

397
00:24:14,727 --> 00:24:16,638
I'm afraid not, William.

398
00:24:20,847 --> 00:24:24,078
Well, you just tell her

399
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:26,158
that wherever I am, I'll be thinking of her.

400
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:28,681
And I got her face tattooed on my arm.

401
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,644
It's from our prom photo.

402
00:24:31,607 --> 00:24:34,565
Well, it's beautiful work.

403
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:39,436
Well.

404
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,882
Now I feel like a terrible person.

405
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:50,279
Oh, you can't help it if that boy wants
to go do something foolish like get a tattoo.

406
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,517
I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored,

407

I'm bored, bored,
bored of these contestants.

408
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,927
I want some variety, okay?

409
00:25:04,247 --> 00:25:08,035
I want someone to love, I want someone
to pity, I want someone to laugh at.

410
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:11,403
I want someone to masturbate over.
Well, possibly we have that already.

411
00:25:11,487 --> 00:25:15,002
I want... I want an Arab.

412
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:17,520
I'm part Arab.

413
00:25:17,607 --> 00:25:18,926
No, don't be ridiculous.

414
00:25:19,007 --> 00:25:21,840
No. Mother's Syrian. Dad's Korean.

415
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,486
Good God. All right, then.

416
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:26,604
Bring me a fellow Arab. And a Jew.

417
00:25:26,687 --> 00:25:28,564
Bring me an Arab and a Jew.

418
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:30,797
What about an Arab Jew?

419
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:32,161
Don't be funny.

I'm sorry to interrupt.

421
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:37,200
Martin, I've got the White House
on the phone for you.

422
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:40,563
- No, love. I don't think you have.
- I think I do.

Hello? Martin Tweed.

424
00:25:46,687 --> 00:25:48,040
No commercials.

425
00:25:48,127 --> 00:25:50,561
Don't be ridiculous.
We can't do no commercials.

426
00:25:50,647 --> 00:25:53,286
The PR benefit to you
will more than make up for it.

427
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:56,882
With all due respect,
we are the number one show on TV.

428
00:25:56,967 --> 00:26:00,277
We are watched by college freshmen,
grandmas in retirement homes,

429
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:02,198
death-row inmates, nuns.

430
00:26:02,287 --> 00:26:05,199
We hit every demo.
That is the reason you've come to us.

431
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:07,278
You need the PR more than we do.

432
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:09,881
We're talking about
the President of the United States, here.

433
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:12,435
Yeah, a President who hasn't been seen
in public for weeks.

434
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:14,279
There are rumours he's gone bonkers.

435
00:26:14,367 --> 00:26:18,485
He hasn't gone bonkers. Doing great.
Feeling good, has a good sense of humour,

436
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:20,842
tremendous popular appeal.
Man of the people.

437
00:26:20,927 --> 00:26:23,395
That's why we want to get him out there
in a big way.

438
00:26:23,487 --> 00:26:25,637
I heard you're also booking him
on <i>Larry King</i> and <i>Oprah.</i>

439
00:26:25,727 --> 00:26:27,399
- That's correct.
- No, that is incorrect.

440
00:26:27,487 --> 00:26:29,682
If he does our show, he cannot do
any other show before our show

441
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:31,883
and he cannot do another show
for at least a week afterwards.

442
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:33,286
But those are talk shows.

443
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:35,756
The President's old friends with Larry
and he loves Oprah.

444
00:26:35,847 --> 00:26:37,917
Don't we all? Still, those are my terms.

445
00:26:38,007 --> 00:26:40,396
No other TV appearances.
Two commercial breaks.

446
00:26:40,487 --> 00:26:42,000
- No commercial breaks.
- Two.

447
00:26:42,087 --> 00:26:43,600
- One.
- One.

448
00:26:45,047 --> 00:26:46,799
One commercial break.

449
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:49,845
- Okay.
- Okay. Great! Great!

you would have been here last month!

- Oh, I'll show you.

- Fourteen months.

I had kind of an accelerated basic training.

I was pretty surprised when they said,
"Pack your bags, you're going to Iraq."

00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:22,927
Honestly, I thought they were joking.

513
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:18,325
See, everyone in America
thinks they're middle class.

514
00:30:18,407 --> 00:30:20,557
So they like to have someone
to look down on.

515
00:30:20,647 --> 00:30:21,841
We are middle class.

516
00:30:21,927 --> 00:30:25,237
Mom, shut your gaping pie hole.
Go on, Chet Krogl.

517
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:28,075
Human interest is what wins these things.

in Chicago.

521
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:36,565
Another man.

522
00:30:37,847 --> 00:30:40,566
Maybe? Well, no.

523
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:43,726
Let's not feature that.
That's too much of a wild card.

524
00:30:43,807 --> 00:30:47,436
Now, one thing that is important, Sally,
is that you not appear to want it too much.

525
00:30:47,527 --> 00:30:49,677
I'm just singing for the love of singing.

526
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:51,564
As long as I get to get on that stage

527
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:55,845
and perform in front of
that incredible audience, I'm happy.

528
00:30:56,407 --> 00:30:58,238
Not bad. Not bad.

529
00:30:59,847 --> 00:31:02,236
Now, of course, on the inside,
you do need to want it really badly.

530
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,364
Mr Krogl, I'd rather jab my eyes out
with toothpicks and eat them

- Okay. Awesome!

532

- So, you're gonna want to lose 20.
- Screw you.

534

I control my weight swings. No one else.

535
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:23,757
Having a little extra meat, taking it off,
packing it on can make people root for you.

It hasn't hurt Oprah.

It's Sally's old boyfriend.

548

She broke up with him a few weeks ago.

549
00:32:12,327 --> 00:32:13,919
Yeah, it just wasn't gonna work.

550
00:32:14,007 --> 00:32:17,044
Every time he smiled, I wanted to hit him
in the head with my shoe.

551
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:20,246
So he's a returning war veteran
injured in Iraq?

one hell of a President,"

681
00:39:54,287 --> 00:39:56,801
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Okay. No problem.

682
00:39:56,887 --> 00:40:00,562
Do you know what? Do you think I might
go upstairs and talk to Sally in private?

683
00:40:01,087 --> 00:40:03,123
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

684
00:40:26,567 --> 00:40:29,286
- Cool car.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

685
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:32,759
Not easy renting a Ferrari in Padookie, Ohio.

686
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:38,605
I'm surprised that you're here,
'cause I thought

687
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:41,679
we were supposed to meet
for the first time onstage at the show.

688
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:44,565
Yeah. Normally we would.
I never produce these segments.

689
00:40:44,647 --> 00:40:47,445
But I heard Padookie was an exciting town,
thought I'd check it out.

690
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:51,803
- That was a joke.
- I'm aware.

691
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:54,159
You didn't laugh.

692
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,965
It wasn't funny.

693
00:40:57,527 --> 00:40:58,562
No.

694
00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:02,966
But why didn't you laugh
just to kiss my ass?

695
00:41:03,247 --> 00:41:05,238
I figure you didn't need me to kiss your ass.

696
00:41:05,327 --> 00:41:09,525
I mean, I'm sure you have people
kissing your ass 24 hours a day.

697
00:41:10,727 --> 00:41:15,084
And I guess, like, not kissing your ass
is like kissing your ass for most people.

698
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:17,845
Absolutely right.

699
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:23,077
It's weird. One can become quite detached
from reality when one's famous.

700
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:24,316
Really.

701
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:27,280
That sounds so cool.

702
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:29,562
Yeah, it can be.

703
00:41:33,567 --> 00:41:37,446
So, Sally, I've seen your tapes
and I think you're very talented.

704
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:40,965
- Really? You do?
- Well, moderately.

705
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:43,439
But beyond that...

706
00:41:43,727 --> 00:41:45,080
Beyond that?

707
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:47,519
I think I like you.

708
00:41:49,527 --> 00:41:51,279
I don't mean romantically, I mean

709
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:55,556
I think I like you as a human being.

710
00:42:01,127 --> 00:42:02,924
MARTIN: So, have you ever been
in a Ferrari before?

711
00:42:03,007 --> 00:42:04,918
SALLY: Yeah, yeah, tons of times.

712
00:42:07,127 --> 00:42:10,244
You know, sometimes I'll be driving
my Enzo down Mulholland Drive,

713
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:13,524
really gunning it. I'll look at the little railing
at the side of the road

714
00:42:13,607 --> 00:42:15,882
and the steep drop just beyond that
and I'll think,

715
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:19,482
"Wouldn't it be great just to shoot
off the edge of the cliff?"

716
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:22,806
- Wouldn't that be fun?
- Mr Tweed, I...

717
00:42:22,887 --> 00:42:25,720
No, no, no, no, no. Don't call me Mr Tweed.
Call me Tweedy.

718
00:42:25,807 --> 00:42:29,277
- Like Tweety Bird, but with a 'd'?
- Exactly, yeah.

719
00:42:30,007 --> 00:42:34,125
You know, my mum used to say to me,
"Martin, you have no talent.

720
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:36,044
"No one will ever love you."

721
00:42:36,127 --> 00:42:39,517
Well, look at me now, Mum!
Look where no talent will get you!

722
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,037
You jealous, drunk old bitch.

723
00:42:42,247 --> 00:42:43,965
Really, that's great.

724
00:42:44,047 --> 00:42:47,278
But, Tweedy, can you help me win?

725
00:42:47,527 --> 00:42:50,280
Because I would do absolutely anything
to win this show.

726
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:53,518
I'd love to help you, Sally,
but there's only so much I can do.

727
00:42:53,607 --> 00:42:56,075
It's down to you.
You've got to make the people love you.

728
00:42:56,167 --> 00:42:59,364
- The way that they love you?
- Nope. Nobody loves me.

729
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:03,557
My mum was right about that.
But it's fine, I don't care.

730
00:43:04,007 --> 00:43:07,238
I don't want the fake bullshit
that passes for love in this world.

731
00:43:07,327 --> 00:43:11,081
Well, you don't have to worry about me,
I'm not even sure that I like you.

732
00:43:11,607 --> 00:43:12,642
Wow.

733
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:15,118
My God,
I can't believe I just said that out loud.

734
00:43:15,207 --> 00:43:16,879
I never say stuff like that out loud.

735
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:19,162
I think you are a rapacious little bitch.

736
00:43:19,247 --> 00:43:21,920
Well, I think you're a self-involved,
preening idiot.

737
00:43:22,007 --> 00:43:24,805
Sociopathic, egomaniacal,
Madonna wannabe.

738
00:43:24,887 --> 00:43:28,880
No-talent, famous-for-being-famous,
third-rate, Regis Philbin clone!

739
00:43:31,127 --> 00:43:33,687
SHAZZY: So, at the mall today,
I upgraded my plan to 5,000 minutes,

740
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:34,836
but it's a family plan.

741
00:43:34,927 --> 00:43:37,964
- Thank you, Auntie.
- IQBAL: You should've gotten 10,000.

742
00:43:38,047 --> 00:43:39,765
- Lqbal?
- Yeah.

743
00:43:40,567 --> 00:43:44,003
Something very odd happened today.
It's funny, really.

744
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:47,841
You see, these people from the
<i>American Dreamz</i> television show came by.

745
00:43:51,047 --> 00:43:53,197
- Yeah?
- And...

746
00:43:55,687 --> 00:43:57,723
- And?
- And I was using your stage

747
00:43:57,807 --> 00:44:00,321
and they heard me singing
and they want me to be on the show.

748
00:44:03,127 --> 00:44:07,439
I'm sorry. Did you say they want you
to sing on the show?

749
00:44:07,527 --> 00:44:08,562
Mmm-hmm.

750
00:44:08,647 --> 00:44:09,921
Isn't that amusing?

751
00:44:10,007 --> 00:44:11,759
- Holy crap.
- NAZNEEN: Shazzy.

752
00:44:12,247 --> 00:44:14,556
- Congratulations, Omer!
- Thank you.

753
00:44:14,647 --> 00:44:16,797
"Congratulations, Omer!"
That's what you have to say!

754
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,605
"Congratulations, Omer!"

755
00:44:18,967 --> 00:44:21,686
Do you know how hard I have worked
to get on this show?

756
00:44:21,767 --> 00:44:23,519
You've stolen my dream!

757
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:26,997
I'm so sorry. I told them.
I told them they had made a mistake.

758
00:44:27,407 --> 00:44:28,476
But do not worry.

759
00:44:28,567 --> 00:44:32,560
I will simply refuse
to be on the television show. Yes?

760
00:44:32,647 --> 00:44:35,002
Yes, and then they must take you instead.

761
00:44:35,127 --> 00:44:36,845
They don't want me.

762
00:44:37,527 --> 00:44:40,121
Nobody wants me!

763
00:44:40,527 --> 00:44:43,246
Nonsense, sweetheart. We all love you.

764
00:44:44,407 --> 00:44:47,524
Is that going to make me famous?
I don't think so.

765
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,439
MARTIN: (ON TV) <i>Next week, the exciting</i>
<i>premiere episode of</i> American Dreamz.

766
00:44:59,527 --> 00:45:02,678
<i>Which of these hopefuls will live</i>
<i>the next American dream?</i>

767
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,879
Wait. Rewind the TiVo.

768
00:45:16,327 --> 00:45:17,601
Pause it.

769
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:23,282
- Hello.
- Hello, Mrs Riza.

770
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:26,520
- Is Omer at home, please?
- Yes, he is.

771
00:45:27,287 --> 00:45:29,642
Who shall I say is asking for him?

772
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,036
Just some friends.

773
00:45:34,287 --> 00:45:35,879
NAZNEEN: Come in, please.

774
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:45,684
- Sun block, anyone?
- Yes. Thank you, Auntie.

775
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:46,802
NAZNEEN: Sure.

776
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,364
Now, I am going to bring you boys
a little treat.

777
00:45:50,807 --> 00:45:52,081
Thank you.

778
00:45:59,367 --> 00:46:01,756
Very cushy situation you have here.

779
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,564
- No pool?
- No. No, just the Jacuzzi.

780
00:46:11,447 --> 00:46:15,076
The Western Command has learned of you
being chosen to sing and dance

781
00:46:15,167 --> 00:46:19,285
on a hedonistic television show
aptly named <i>American Dreamz.</i>

782
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:23,484
Wow. You guys heard about that?

783
00:46:25,807 --> 00:46:27,604
OMER: It's all a big mistake, you see.

784
00:46:27,687 --> 00:46:30,485
They got me mixed up with my cousin.

785
00:46:30,927 --> 00:46:34,636
Because I would never engage
in such a frivolous activity.

786
00:46:35,207 --> 00:46:38,517
In fact, I'm going to tell them
I will not be on the show.

787
00:46:38,647 --> 00:46:40,717
You are to do no such thing.

788
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:42,958
You are to perform on the show.

789
00:46:43,047 --> 00:46:45,481
And you must get
to the championship round,

790
00:46:45,567 --> 00:46:47,683
because judging the championship round

791
00:46:47,767 --> 00:46:51,840
will be none other than the
President of the United States of America.

792
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,160
The President?

793
00:46:54,447 --> 00:46:59,123
When you are onstage with the President,
you will have smuggled in an explosive belt.

794
00:46:59,407 --> 00:47:01,682
And you are to martyr yourself.

795
00:47:01,767 --> 00:47:04,839
Killing, in the process,
the head of the serpent.

796
00:47:05,807 --> 00:47:08,241
What if I don't make it to the final round?

797
00:47:08,327 --> 00:47:11,285
Omer, folks don't call me "The Torturer"

798
00:47:11,367 --> 00:47:13,403
because I don't like to torture people.

799
00:47:13,487 --> 00:47:15,205
You know what I mean?

800
00:47:17,487 --> 00:47:20,797
Now, who would like to try
some grapefruit sorbet?

816

This thing is incredible. Great reception.

817
00:48:17,007 --> 00:48:19,885
I can't believe I didn't think of it earlier.

818
00:48:20,247 --> 00:48:23,922
Hell of a week, sir!
You really got back on message.

819
00:48:24,007 --> 00:48:26,567
That's because you're telling me
what the message is.

820
00:48:26,647 --> 00:48:27,796
Exactly.

821
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,805
I just love that Carmen Electra. Thanks.

822
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,562

823
00:48:34,647 --> 00:48:37,241

824
00:48:38,007 --> 00:48:39,440

00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:42,557

Hey.

830
00:48:59,927 --> 00:49:01,121
What are you doing?

831
00:49:01,207 --> 00:49:04,279
Nothing. Nothing.
I'm just rehearsing some dance steps.

832
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:05,402
Oh.

833
00:49:05,607 --> 00:49:07,040
Look, lqbal.

834
00:49:08,007 --> 00:49:09,884
- I am so sorry...
- Stop.

835
00:49:11,447 --> 00:49:14,803
I don't want your pity.
Does it look like I need pity?

836
00:49:15,687 --> 00:49:18,201
No, no, no. You have far too much dignity.

837
00:49:18,287 --> 00:49:22,075
If these people know nothing about talent,
there's not much I can do about it, is there?

838
00:49:25,047 --> 00:49:27,845
So let's see it. Let's see your dance steps.

839
00:49:29,487 --> 00:49:30,761

Oh, there's no way
you're gonna win this thing.

00:49:41,327 --> 00:49:43,238
I know. I fear as much.

00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:53,880

00:49:53,967 --> 00:49:56,162
Do it. Before I change my mind.

847
00:49:58,047 --> 00:50:01,722
Okay. Now this is just the bass track.
It's good to practice moves to.

848
00:50:02,007 --> 00:50:05,920
- I don't like this kind of music.
- It's just a bass track. It's just for rehearsal!

849
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,681
Okay.

850
00:50:10,727 --> 00:50:14,766
Now, one problem you have is you move
like a re-animated corpse in a zombie movie.

851
00:50:14,847 --> 00:50:16,041
Not good.

852
00:50:16,287 --> 00:50:17,800
You need to loosen up.

853
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,798
Okay. Come on, let's go.

854
00:50:20,887 --> 00:50:22,764
Free-form jazz dancing,
right now, immediately.

855
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,963
Lqbal, why are you helping me?

856
00:50:25,527 --> 00:50:27,358
I destroyed your dream.

857
00:50:28,407 --> 00:50:29,522
Yeah.

858
00:50:30,087 --> 00:50:31,315
You did.

859
00:50:31,847 --> 00:50:33,565
But that was yesterday.

860
00:50:33,967 --> 00:50:37,277
Today, I've turned a page
on a new chapter in my life.

861
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:41,121
I'm not sure being a performer
was ever what I was really meant for.

862
00:50:41,207 --> 00:50:44,563
I'm more of a behind-the-scenes player.
A puppeteer.

863
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:46,405
A Svengali, if you will.

864
00:50:47,927 --> 00:50:49,406
As of today,

865
00:50:50,207 --> 00:50:51,845
I'm your manager.

866
00:50:53,047 --> 00:50:57,438
This is Martin Tweed, and I am
in the small town of Padookie, Ohio.

867
00:50:58,007 --> 00:51:00,441
Our first dream starts right here,

868
00:51:00,527 --> 00:51:04,406
where local <i>chanteuse</i> Sally Kendoo
hopes her dream comes true.

869
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,120
(SCREAMING)

870
00:51:06,207 --> 00:51:08,004
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

871
00:51:08,327 --> 00:51:12,764
It was always Sally's idea to perform,
not mine.

872
00:51:13,327 --> 00:51:16,524
I mean, she's been wanting to do this
since she was six months old.

873
00:51:17,127 --> 00:51:18,401
Sing!

874
00:51:19,767 --> 00:51:23,362
She did it before. She's just shy.
Come on, honey. Sing!

875
00:51:23,807 --> 00:51:25,718
MARTIN: <i>The last remaining business</i>
<i>on Main Street</i>

876
00:51:25,807 --> 00:51:27,525
<i>is Harry's Hangdown Bar and Grill</i>

877
00:51:27,767 --> 00:51:30,235
<i>where Sally works as a part-time waitress.</i>

878
00:51:30,327 --> 00:51:32,158
The Hangdown is a home away from home

879
00:51:32,247 --> 00:51:34,886
for the largely unemployed male population
of Padookie.

880
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,036

881
00:51:40,007 --> 00:51:41,520

<i>Omer Obeidi lives with his cousins,</i>

887
00:51:58,327 --> 00:52:01,956
I cannot believe my good fortune
to be competing on the show.

888
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:05,606
This is truly an American dream come true.

889

890
00:52:08,207 --> 00:52:09,356
Now.

891
00:52:09,487 --> 00:52:12,320
America, you will be Omerised.

892
00:52:14,287 --> 00:52:17,757
MARTIN: <i>Like any American kid,</i>
<i>Omer likes to hang out at the mall</i>

893
00:52:17,847 --> 00:52:19,485
<i>where his posse all know him.</i>

894

Keep it real, man! Remember that.
Keep it real.

898

There may not be peace in the Middle East,

01:00:46,487 --> 01:00:47,966

1018
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,723
<i>I think I have been Omerised.</i>

1019
01:00:50,807 --> 01:00:52,763
<i>I think I might be Omer-sexual.</i>

1020
01:01:16,967 --> 01:01:18,320
Oh, my God!

1021
01:01:21,087 --> 01:01:22,202
Yes!

1022
01:01:22,727 --> 01:01:24,957
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1023
01:01:25,047 --> 01:01:26,241

<i>From faraway places</i>

1026
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:00,680
<i>And far distant lands</i>

1027
01:02:01,887 --> 01:02:03,798
<i>And still they come</i>

1028
01:02:04,127 --> 01:02:07,483
<i>To a place where they're free</i>

1029
01:02:08,327 --> 01:02:10,318
<i>They fly in on planes</i>

<i>Sometimes it feels</i>

1032
01:02:16,887 --> 01:02:19,685
<i>Like we're stuffed to the seams</i>

1033
01:02:20,127 --> 01:02:24,279

01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:06,681
We began the show with 50 dreamers.

1046
01:03:07,247 --> 01:03:09,397
Now we're down to just three.

1047
01:03:12,447 --> 01:03:13,766
- Boo.
- AUDIENCE: Boo!

1048
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,166
How are you doing?

1049
01:03:16,887 --> 01:03:18,366
You all right?

1050
01:03:19,727 --> 01:03:21,877
And the two finalists

1051
01:03:29,367 --> 01:03:32,882
will be revealed after this commercial break
brought to you by American Motors,

1052
01:03:32,967 --> 01:03:36,562
introducing "The Tank," 50% larger
than the next biggest SUV on the road,

1053
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:38,046
because you need it.

1054
01:03:38,487 --> 01:03:41,638
STAGE MANAGER: And we're out! Come on,
people. Hair and makeup, let's go, let's go.

1055
01:03:42,727 --> 01:03:45,036
All right.
Give me some room over here, Travis.

1056
01:03:45,127 --> 01:03:48,722
Calm, calm, calm, calm.
Thank you, thank you very much.

1057
01:03:49,047 --> 01:03:51,607
Here you go.
And you're supposed to be drinking this.

1058
01:03:51,687 --> 01:03:53,723
- Must I?
- Contractually, yes.

1059
01:03:53,807 --> 01:03:56,002
- Your envelope.
- Thank you.

1060
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:59,158
STAGE MANAGER: All right, let's wrap it up.
Let's get it started.

1061
01:03:59,247 --> 01:04:00,441
Let's get the chairs out, let's go.

1062
01:04:00,527 --> 01:04:02,358
Get the lead out. Big smiles, everyone.

1063
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:05,644
Big smiles. And we're back. Three, two.

1064
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:09,725
Excuse me. Delicious.
That's wildly refreshing.

1065
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:14,156
And now, America, you have voted.

1066
01:04:25,287 --> 01:04:26,959
- Sholem Glickstein?
- Yeah.

1067
01:04:38,447 --> 01:04:39,721
You are

1068
01:04:42,127 --> 01:04:44,004
not a winner.

1069
01:04:48,967 --> 01:04:51,640
This week's winners who will move on
to the championship round

1070
01:04:51,727 --> 01:04:54,446
are Sally Kendoo and Omer Obeidi.
And don't forget,

1071
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:57,439
on next week's finale, special guest judge,
the President.

1072
01:05:05,647 --> 01:05:06,762
Honey?

1073
01:05:07,967 --> 01:05:10,003
I have a confession to make.

1074
01:05:12,407 --> 01:05:14,682
I haven't been taking my happy pills.

1075
01:05:16,367 --> 01:05:19,165
Actually, I haven't been taking mine, either.

1076
01:05:19,487 --> 01:05:22,604
- But you don't seem sad.
- Well, I guess I'm not.

1077
01:05:23,327 --> 01:05:26,876
At first, those happy pills
really helped me a lot.

1078
01:05:27,167 --> 01:05:31,604
But, eventually, I think they were just
kind of like placebos.

1079
01:05:32,207 --> 01:05:35,119
Placebos? Aren't they illegal?

1080
01:05:36,607 --> 01:05:40,885
No, Poopie. It means fake.

1081
01:05:43,887 --> 01:05:45,240
Well, yeah.

1082
01:05:45,487 --> 01:05:46,602
Well.

1083
01:05:49,807 --> 01:05:51,035
You know,

1084
01:05:52,047 --> 01:05:55,596
I guess I kind of feel like I'm a placebo.

1085
01:05:58,607 --> 01:06:01,519
I mean, I've had speech writers

1086
01:06:01,927 --> 01:06:03,963
writing for me all my career,

1087
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:07,005
and advisors telling me
what positions to take.

1088
01:06:09,127 --> 01:06:12,802
I can't even remember why I wanted
to get into politics to begin with.

1089
01:06:14,367 --> 01:06:17,086
I think it's 'cause my mom wanted me to.

1090
01:06:18,087 --> 01:06:20,521
Show my dad any idiot could do it.

1091
01:06:21,607 --> 01:06:25,361
Maybe I ought to just chuck the whole thing.
What do you think?

1092
01:06:25,567 --> 01:06:27,842
Starting with that <i>American Dreamz</i> deal.

1093
01:06:27,927 --> 01:06:29,997
Don't you say that.

1094
01:06:31,327 --> 01:06:35,320
Do you remember what I said
the first time I met you?

1095
01:06:36,127 --> 01:06:37,242
Yeah.

1096
01:06:37,487 --> 01:06:40,445
"Hey, jerk-off, you spilled your beer on me."

1097
01:06:41,687 --> 01:06:43,166
After that.

1098
01:06:43,887 --> 01:06:46,037
When you went and got that towel

1099
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:49,881
and borrowed that T-shirt
from one of your frat brothers for me.

1100
01:06:50,687 --> 01:06:53,360
I said, "Now that there is a good guy."

1101
01:06:53,767 --> 01:06:55,803
And I still think so today.

1102
01:06:57,007 --> 01:07:01,159
So you just go on and be on that show.

1103
01:07:02,327 --> 01:07:06,639
And then, afterwards, we will tell Wally
no more earplugs, okay?

1104
01:07:08,767 --> 01:07:11,327
Well, how am I gonna know what to say?

1105
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:15,235
Well, we will think of it together.

1106
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,400
Mmm-hmm.

1107
01:07:25,407 --> 01:07:27,318
Look at this! "Omer Mania!"

1108
01:07:27,647 --> 01:07:30,366
"America's newest mascot, adorable,

1109
01:07:30,847 --> 01:07:33,884
"Omer Obeidi
has 'Omerised' the whole country."

1110
01:07:34,407 --> 01:07:36,284
It should have been me.

1111
01:07:37,247 --> 01:07:39,841
I mean, great, Omer! They love you!

AGHA: Room service.

1114
01:07:43,767 --> 01:07:47,157
Hey, what are you gonna say
when you meet the President?

1115
01:07:48,367 --> 01:07:49,402
Sorry?

1116
01:07:49,487 --> 01:07:52,047
"Sorry?" Omer, you crack me up.

1117
01:07:52,127 --> 01:07:54,846
Okay, we got two orders
spicy tuna hand rolls,

1118
01:07:54,927 --> 01:07:57,760
a plate of fresh fruit
and some chimichangas.

1119
01:08:04,807 --> 01:08:07,367
Oh, you guys go ahead and start eating. I...

1120
01:08:07,447 --> 01:08:10,996
I have to go talk to the waiter in private
for a moment.

1121
01:08:13,207 --> 01:08:14,322
So.

1122
01:08:15,447 --> 01:08:18,200
You have become quite the famous man.

1123
01:08:19,007 --> 01:08:22,397
- You know why they vote for you?
- Because they like me?

1124
01:08:22,487 --> 01:08:23,636
(SCOFFS)

1125
01:08:24,687 --> 01:08:27,281
Because you are a figure of fun to them.

1126
01:08:27,967 --> 01:08:31,164
They see you prancing and singing
and they can forget the terrors

1127
01:08:31,247 --> 01:08:34,922
they've inflicted on our lands
with their soldiers and weapons.

1128
01:08:35,007 --> 01:08:36,963
It could be. Yes, I guess.

1129
01:08:37,207 --> 01:08:39,004
But I have to hand it to you.

1130
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:43,365
You have put us in a wonderful position
to strike them a crippling blow.

1131
01:08:46,447 --> 01:08:48,358
About that crippling blow.

1132
01:08:48,967 --> 01:08:50,639
I really don't know
how I'm supposed to do it.

1133
01:08:50,727 --> 01:08:53,116
You see, really,
there is a lot of security there.

1134
01:08:53,207 --> 01:08:56,165
All you have to do is get me and the rest
of your brothers on the guest list

1135
01:08:56,247 --> 01:08:58,044
for the studio audience.

1136
01:08:58,247 --> 01:09:01,876
We will smuggle in the explosive device
in pieces, assemble it there,

1137
01:09:01,967 --> 01:09:03,639
and then you must only retrieve it

1138
01:09:03,727 --> 01:09:07,163
in the toilet-seat-cover dispenser
in the men's bathroom.

1139
01:09:07,367 --> 01:09:10,165
Then, when you meet the President

1140
01:09:10,487 --> 01:09:13,285
and shake his hand, live on television,

1141
01:09:13,367 --> 01:09:15,403
you will ignite the device.

1142
01:09:16,007 --> 01:09:18,362
And I will see you in paradise.

1143
01:09:19,607 --> 01:09:21,484
You will be killed, too?

1144
01:09:21,767 --> 01:09:24,679
Not yet. It's a pretty small bomb.

1145
01:09:25,247 --> 01:09:27,807
But I'll see you up there
in a few years, I'm sure.

1146
01:09:30,847 --> 01:09:34,999
So, I'm just curious.
How is this Martin Tweed in person?

and now the whole world knows it, too.

they love that Middle Eastern guy.

They love you more.

01:09:53,967 --> 01:09:57,642
They love us more. You know how many hits
we got on our website last night?

01:09:57,727 --> 01:09:59,319
Sixteen million.

- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1156
01:10:03,047 --> 01:10:07,677
God, William. You make me feel bad.
Why do you care so much about me?

1157
01:10:07,847 --> 01:10:09,121
Why?

1158
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:14,046
Because, honey, you are my dream girl.

1159
01:10:14,247 --> 01:10:15,600
Yuck.

1160
01:10:15,687 --> 01:10:17,803
I can't stand looking
at those damn French fries anymore.

1161
01:10:17,887 --> 01:10:19,479
Just cover them up or something.

Sally Kendoo, I love you.

1163
01:10:22,127 --> 01:10:24,357
Okay? I love you.

1164
01:10:24,607 --> 01:10:27,121
I love how you binge eat
and then starve yourself.

1165
01:10:27,207 --> 01:10:29,323
I love how pretty you sing,
whether it's in the shower

1166
01:10:29,407 --> 01:10:31,443
or in front of millions of TV viewers.

1167
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:35,839
I look at you and I see that same girl
that I fell in love with in high school.

1168
01:10:36,567 --> 01:10:39,240
And I'd like to know, right here and now,

1169
01:10:40,007 --> 01:10:44,159
if you'd help to make my dream come true
and marry me?

1170
01:10:45,367 --> 01:10:46,686
Oh, my God.

1171
01:10:48,287 --> 01:10:49,686
Oh, my Lord.

- I'm calling the camera crew.

1174
01:10:54,127 --> 01:10:56,083
No, you're not. Put the phone down, Chet.

1175

- Chet, put the phone down right now!
- Chet, put the phone down!

What, are you kidding me?
This is great stuff.

- And, William, stand up, please.
- But...

1178
01:11:06,647 --> 01:11:07,921
Stand up.

1179
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:11,836
Now, please understand.
I am so touched by your proposal

1180
01:11:11,927 --> 01:11:14,760
and the sweet things
that you just said to me, but...

1181
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:17,601
Right now is a really bad time.

1182
01:11:17,687 --> 01:11:19,200
Do it on the show!

- On the show?
- Absolutely.

1184
01:11:21,287 --> 01:11:22,925
That's a great idea.

01:11:23,007 --> 01:11:24,042
- Really?
- CHET: Yes.

1186
01:11:24,127 --> 01:11:26,118
And do that thing about how
every time you look at her

1187
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:28,277
you see the same girl
you fell in love with in high school.

1188
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:31,279
- What, you were listening?
- I'm in the other room, man, so, yes.

1189
01:11:31,367 --> 01:11:34,518
And you. Hey, you!
Are you still into winning this thing?

1190
01:11:34,607 --> 01:11:37,519
Because this is what we in the biz call
"incredible television."

1191
01:11:37,607 --> 01:11:39,404
People are going to be
in their living rooms, sobbing.

1192
01:11:39,487 --> 01:11:40,886
Then they're gonna be
crawling over each other

1193
01:11:40,967 --> 01:11:43,765
trying to get to the phone
so they can call up and vote for you!

1194
01:11:46,007 --> 01:11:50,239
Well, I'm up for it if you are, Sally.

1195
01:11:50,327 --> 01:11:51,601
Yes! This guy!

1196
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:53,279
We are gonna get into this
with the producers.

1197
01:11:53,367 --> 01:11:55,039
Can I see that ring for a second?

1198
01:11:55,127 --> 01:11:56,526
Wow, that's great.

1199
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:58,518
We're gonna get a bigger one
so that it plays on TV,

1200
01:11:58,607 --> 01:11:59,960
but there is nothing wrong with that ring.

1201
01:12:00,047 --> 01:12:01,400
Now, here's what I'm thinking, okay?

1202
01:12:01,487 --> 01:12:03,079
It's gonna be a special
built around the wedding.

1203
01:12:03,167 --> 01:12:04,600
- Do you sing at all, William?
- I can sing a little bit.

1204
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:05,881
I thought you could sing a little bit.

1205
01:12:05,967 --> 01:12:08,481
I think we're gonna call it
"Sally and William, sealed with a kiss."

1206
01:12:08,567 --> 01:12:09,920
- What do you think about that?
- I love that.

1207
01:12:10,007 --> 01:12:12,362
Yeah, I think everyone's gonna love that.

1208
01:12:46,047 --> 01:12:47,321
Hey, Omer?

1209
01:12:48,047 --> 01:12:49,765
Can I buy you a beer?

1210
01:12:50,047 --> 01:12:53,357
Oh, no, no, no, no. I do not drink.
But thank you.

1211
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:02,841
Hey, do you ever wonder why you're doing
this whole competition thing for?

1212
01:13:04,527 --> 01:13:06,119
Only every day.

1213
01:13:10,807 --> 01:13:12,957
But then I think of my mother.

1214
01:13:13,807 --> 01:13:16,037
She loved all types of singing.

1215
01:13:17,247 --> 01:13:19,124
It keeps me going on.

1216
01:13:25,847 --> 01:13:27,758
When I was 10 years old,

1217
01:13:28,887 --> 01:13:30,605
I weighed 200 pounds.

1218
01:13:32,607 --> 01:13:35,041
- That is large.
- Yeah.

1219
01:13:37,967 --> 01:13:42,643
And I told myself I would lose 90 pounds
by the time I turned 14 or I would kill myself.

1220
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:46,680
So I lost the weight.

1221
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:48,321
And...

1222
01:13:49,727 --> 01:13:51,922
I suddenly was really popular.

1223
01:13:52,007 --> 01:13:56,159
I had a whole new group of friends.
I had this cute boyfriend.

1224
01:13:56,567 --> 01:13:58,876
Even my teachers liked me better.

1225
01:13:59,847 --> 01:14:01,678
And my mom and I
walked around the entire house

1226
01:14:01,767 --> 01:14:05,521
collecting all the pictures of me
when I was fat and burned them.

1227
01:14:08,447 --> 01:14:09,926
I love my mom.

1228
01:14:16,727 --> 01:14:18,001
So.

1229
01:14:19,567 --> 01:14:21,046
Good luck tomorrow.

1230
01:14:22,327 --> 01:14:23,601
Thank you.

1231
01:14:25,367 --> 01:14:27,676
Sorry I'm gonna have to destroy you.

1232
01:14:50,287 --> 01:14:52,198
Here is your chewing gum.

1233
01:14:52,727 --> 01:14:54,763
Remember, no blowing bubbles.

1234
01:15:00,327 --> 01:15:02,283
Is this really necessary?

1235
01:15:02,367 --> 01:15:06,076
Just a little bit higher. Oh, that's good.

1236
01:15:07,287 --> 01:15:10,597
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Give me a little bit more in here.

1237
01:15:10,687 --> 01:15:12,757
Take my moustache down a little bit, too.

1238
01:15:16,487 --> 01:15:18,955
SHAZZY: My cousin's gonna be in the finale.

1239
01:15:31,607 --> 01:15:33,006
- William?
- Yeah, yeah.

1240
01:15:33,087 --> 01:15:34,964
Okay. Omer's gonna go on first.

1241
01:15:35,047 --> 01:15:37,766
Then after Sally is done,
we're gonna hit you with a spotlight.

1242
01:15:37,847 --> 01:15:40,202
Then you're gonna go onstage
and do your proposal.

1243
01:15:40,287 --> 01:15:41,356
- Got it?
- Got it.

1244
01:15:41,447 --> 01:15:43,836
- All right.
- It's happening.

1245
01:15:44,927 --> 01:15:46,599
She's very excited.

1246
01:15:46,767 --> 01:15:48,723
It's a joyful moment. Joyful.

1247
01:15:51,127 --> 01:15:53,402
- Hi, Tweedy.
- Hi, Sally.

1248
01:15:57,087 --> 01:16:00,636
Just wanted to say good luck tonight.

1249
01:16:01,007 --> 01:16:02,281
Thank you.

1250
01:16:02,447 --> 01:16:04,483
Could you just give us
a quick second, please?

1251
01:16:04,567 --> 01:16:06,319
- Sure, no problem.
- Thank you.

1252
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:12,636
So.

1253
01:16:13,767 --> 01:16:15,803
I think you're going to win.

1254
01:16:16,847 --> 01:16:18,963
Novelty contestants
never win the whole thing.

1255
01:16:19,047 --> 01:16:22,119
- That's why I've been helping him along.
- Thank you.

1256
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:27,524
Hey, is something wrong?

1257
01:16:28,527 --> 01:16:29,642
No.

1258
01:16:30,967 --> 01:16:33,527
I mean, nothing beyond
the usual creeping dread.

1259
01:16:38,047 --> 01:16:41,357
All right. Well.
I'm sure you know at this point

1260
01:16:41,447 --> 01:16:44,280
that William is supposed to propose to me
on tonight's show.

1261
01:16:44,367 --> 01:16:45,436
Yeah.

1262
01:16:46,367 --> 01:16:49,564
Do you think it's bad of me to accept
a proposal from a man I don't love

1263
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:52,320
in order to manipulate
people into voting for me?

1264
01:16:53,447 --> 01:16:56,405
"Bad." Such a nebulous word, isn't it?

1265
01:16:56,567 --> 01:16:59,923
You know what I think?
I think everyone wants something.

1266
01:17:00,007 --> 01:17:01,599
William wants you.

1267
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:05,876
Why? Because he has this idea in his head
of what you are.

1268
01:17:07,087 --> 01:17:11,000
I don't think he cares if it's true or not,
just so long as he keeps his fantasy alive.

1269
01:17:11,087 --> 01:17:13,203
So I think he deserves what he gets.

1270
01:17:13,287 --> 01:17:16,199
- He deserves to be miserable?
- Why not?

1271
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:18,679
You are, aren't you?

1272
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:22,160
Despite your newfound fame and adulation?

1273
01:17:23,207 --> 01:17:24,242
Tweedy,

1274
01:17:24,327 --> 01:17:28,400
I sometimes feel like you're the only person
in the whole world who really gets me.

1275
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:31,682
Yeah.

1276
01:17:32,887 --> 01:17:36,038
Sometimes I look at you
and I see my own reflection.

1277
01:17:36,687 --> 01:17:38,166
It's revolting.

1278
01:17:39,487 --> 01:17:43,241
And attractive.

1279
01:17:49,167 --> 01:17:50,441
Martin,

1280
01:17:52,127 --> 01:17:56,200
I'm not physically attracted to other people,
but if you want me,

1281
01:17:58,007 --> 01:17:59,326
I'm yours.

1282
01:18:01,087 --> 01:18:04,875
The problem is I find that whenever
I become intimately involved

1283
01:18:05,967 --> 01:18:07,764
with a woman I admire,

1284
01:18:08,847 --> 01:18:11,884
it rapidly degenerates into mutual loathing.

1285
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:15,317
I don't want that to happen to us.

1286
01:18:22,127 --> 01:18:23,765
Having said that...

1287
01:18:53,727 --> 01:18:55,319
Omer, are you okay?

1288
01:18:55,447 --> 01:18:58,325
Great. Great. Just a little nervous, I guess.

1289
01:18:59,407 --> 01:19:01,796
- I just feel confused.
- About what?

1290
01:19:01,927 --> 01:19:03,440
About this country.

1291
01:19:03,527 --> 01:19:05,085
You know, there are
so many nice people here,

1292
01:19:05,167 --> 01:19:07,727
but it does so much harm in the world.

1293
01:19:08,087 --> 01:19:09,122
So?

1294
01:19:09,207 --> 01:19:12,995
So, to what degree is this country
culpable for its actions?

1295
01:19:13,487 --> 01:19:17,002
Are Americans to blame for America?
And beyond that,

1296
01:19:17,847 --> 01:19:22,284
can causing someone else to suffer
ever truly ease one's own suffering?

1297
01:19:22,807 --> 01:19:26,846
Omer! You're wigging out.
That bitch deserves to suffer!

1298
01:19:27,567 --> 01:19:28,716
What bitch?

1299
01:19:28,807 --> 01:19:30,001
Sally! Who are you talking about?

1300
01:19:30,087 --> 01:19:31,122
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

1301
01:19:31,207 --> 01:19:32,481
15 minutes, Omer.

1302
01:19:32,887 --> 01:19:33,956
(SIGHING)

1303
01:19:34,287 --> 01:19:37,040
Well, see, I think the dress works
'cause it flows nice.

1304
01:19:37,127 --> 01:19:39,163
The dress is gonna be a hit.

1305
01:19:41,007 --> 01:19:42,963
Hey, I'm gonna go run lines with Sally.

1306
01:19:43,047 --> 01:19:44,241
- Well, don't be long.
- Okay.

1307
01:19:44,327 --> 01:19:45,442
Yeah.

1308
01:20:16,407 --> 01:20:19,001
Mr President,
it's such an honour to have you here.

1309
01:20:19,087 --> 01:20:20,679
Happy to be here.

1310
01:20:55,567 --> 01:20:59,355
"Press here to explode yourself."

1311
01:21:01,927 --> 01:21:05,158
Where's Martin? Where the hell is Martin?
Has anybody seen Martin?

1312
01:21:05,247 --> 01:21:08,398
- He's in there.
- What the hell is he doing in there?

1313
01:21:09,047 --> 01:21:11,607
- What are you doing?
- This isn't pretty.

1314
01:21:11,687 --> 01:21:12,722
What?

1315
01:21:19,447 --> 01:21:22,359
- That's Sally and Mr Tweed?
- Yep.

1316
01:21:31,447 --> 01:21:33,915
- Are you seeing anybody?
- What?

1317
01:21:39,767 --> 01:21:42,156
It looks so much bigger on TV.

1318
01:21:42,607 --> 01:21:44,199
Hey, watch my foot, huh?

1319
01:21:46,807 --> 01:21:50,163
- So, do you feel filthy?
- Not really.

1320
01:21:51,127 --> 01:21:52,685
How do you feel?

1321
01:21:57,807 --> 01:21:59,126
It's weird.

1322
01:22:00,807 --> 01:22:03,605
- I don't actually loathe you.
- You, either.

1323
01:22:16,567 --> 01:22:18,683
Right. The President here yet?

1324
01:22:18,807 --> 01:22:20,877
ANNOUNCER: <i>Yeah!</i>
<i>How you doing, everybody?</i>

1325
01:22:23,927 --> 01:22:26,964
<i>How many Omer fans</i>
<i>do I have with me tonight?</i>

1326
01:22:27,727 --> 01:22:28,842
<i>Yeah!</i>

1327
01:22:30,247 --> 01:22:34,081
<i>And how many Sally fans do I have?</i>
<i>She can hear you in the back!</i>

1328
01:22:37,367 --> 01:22:41,519
ANNOUNCER: <i>And now your host,</i>
<i>Martin Tweed!</i>

1329
01:22:41,647 --> 01:22:43,365
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

1330
01:22:50,407 --> 01:22:52,079
That's Martin Tweed.

1331
01:22:52,967 --> 01:22:55,356
You're looking very good, sir. Very good.

1332
01:22:57,567 --> 01:22:59,876
Welcome, America.

1333
01:23:00,447 --> 01:23:03,439
Welcome, world. Welcome, everyone else.

1334
01:23:04,447 --> 01:23:05,880
- Boo!
- AUDIENCE: Boo!

1335
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:11,842
We've been through so much together.

1336
01:23:11,927 --> 01:23:15,681
We've laughed. We've cried.
We've formed attachments.

1337
01:23:16,847 --> 01:23:19,315
<i>And now, we're down to just two.</i>

1338
01:23:19,447 --> 01:23:22,803
<i>And to help me help you judge tonight,</i>

1339
01:23:22,887 --> 01:23:25,117
<i>we're welcoming a very special guest.</i>

1340
01:23:25,327 --> 01:23:28,000
<i>The President of this great country,</i>

1341
01:23:28,727 --> 01:23:31,764
<i>President Joseph Staton!</i>

1342
01:23:35,647 --> 01:23:38,002
<i>Thanks for having me on your show.</i>

1343
01:23:47,127 --> 01:23:48,401
So.

1344
01:23:48,487 --> 01:23:51,797
What do you think of these
two great contestants, Mr President?

1345
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:56,525
I think they exhibit
what's best about America.

1346
01:23:58,447 --> 01:24:01,245
- The spirit of resolve...
- The spirit of resolve

1347
01:24:01,327 --> 01:24:04,637
that makes this
the greatest country in the world.

1348
01:24:06,807 --> 01:24:07,922
They know what they want...

1349
01:24:08,007 --> 01:24:10,362
They know what they want
and they go out and get it.

1350
01:24:10,447 --> 01:24:11,641
All right.

1351
01:24:13,047 --> 01:24:16,164
- I'll be right back!
- Omer! Where are you going?
