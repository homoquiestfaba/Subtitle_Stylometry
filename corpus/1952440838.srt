1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,037
What I hate most
it's the guys sticky.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,430
Those who cling

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,395
and know
that means "no".

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,554
Normally, if the other not remember
is dropped.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,473
Finally, I give up.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,989
Good night.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,115
Go away.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,559
Leave me alone.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,949
Go!

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,757
Go, get out Get out.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,114
Go home.

12
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,877
Christopher
it's Michael, on Friday night.

13
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,590
<i>If you want us to review,</i>

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,076
<i>my number is 555</i>

15
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,910
<i>3745. Call me.</i>

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,517
I wanted to see
the path of work...

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,399
I think you forgot
your watch at home.

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,588
<i>And your underpants.</i>

19
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,154
It was great Saturday night.

20
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,390
As I have no news
I call you.

21
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,035
<i>Hello, it's me.</i>
<i>Why you not remember?</i>

22
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,639
Where have you got that?

23
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,513
Chuck sent them.

24
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,309
The guy with the golden retriever.
The bodybuilder.

25
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,473
You have not met
2 days ago?

26
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,196
Si It makes me uncomfortable,
Secretaries talk.

27
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,558
Provided he has not signed the card.
They read everything, especially Lori.

28
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,833
"To Larry. Provided that night
be the first

29
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,354
a long series. "

30
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,230
"I embrace you. Chuck."

31
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,913
You're dealing with a madman.

32
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,713
Someone who sends 12 roses
too fast is not stable.

33
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,154
What should I respond?

34
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,470
Do not answer.
Surely this is insane.

35
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,438
Let him know that I've had.

36
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,832
Surely not!
Above all, do not remember.

37
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,230
I do not know
I am not the cause.

38
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,868
Our company has 60 people.

39
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,235
You think he will land
in your office

40
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,233
with a gun? Stop raving!

41
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,037
Is a loser.

42
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,078
While it is fairly weak
to send flowers

43
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,708
is that it will not
premeditate your death.

44
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,317
A normal guy would not
send me roses?

45
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,639
I forgot to tell you about the guy
I met last night.

46
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,075
What's his name?
I know him?

47
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,516
His name is Clark. As Kent.

48
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,789
95 kg, fed
U.S. beef to 100%.

49
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,430
You can tell he grew
wearing heavy stuff.

50
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,399
What do you do?

51
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,840
Is what I'm gay?

52
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,992
In your opinion, you did what?

53
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,598
Bedford?

54
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,988
Mr. Lake has arrived.

55
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,593
Tell him I'm coming.

56
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,513
Very well, sir.

57
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,432
Well, I gotta go.
See you at the muscle.

58
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,432
It works. Hello.

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,228
Larry!

60
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,548
Your roses.

61
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,631
I know what you think.

62
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,039
"What a jerk!" Right?

63
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,513
But it's not true.

64
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,278
I am honest, that's all.

65
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,879
Sorry for the delay.
My boss is a neurotic.

66
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,873
Do not worry,
we had a quarrel.

67
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,598
You always do this!

68
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,988
What, again?

69
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,470
We can not have a discussion
that remains between us?

70
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,438
Stewart does not care.
Not true, Stewart?

71
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,158
I think it's cute, actually.

72
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,788
Me, I'm not crazy. OK?

73
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,150
Sorry.

74
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,753
In short, we argue not.

75
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,955
I leave you.

76
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,078
No. You've been invited to dinner
then you stay.

77
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,198
The grumpy will calm down.

78
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,955
Moreover,
why you are disputing?

79
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,879
Give your version first.
I want to influence Stewart.

80
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,191
- Tom wants to go elsewhere.
- It is necessary?

81
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,554
- What?
- Wrong.

82
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,439
You want an open relationship.

83
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,034
- I never said that.
- But if.

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,956
I want a more free.

85
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,519
And what does that mean?

86
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,830
Yes, what does that mean?

87
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,113
I do not know.

88
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,032
Change the subject.

89
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,910
- Christopher!
- Susan!

90
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,630
- Lunch.
- You forgot.

91
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,555
I'm sorry.
I have not for long.

92
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,552
Leave me a minute.

93
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,711
It's a mess in my life
now.

94
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,834
- I fucked Jim out.
- Again?

95
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,799
- It has been another girl.
- Again?

96
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,599
And a guy.

97
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,353
It gives in threesomes?

98
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,318
In fact, they were four.

99
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,631
But the second girl was in the toilet
when I landed.

100
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,949
I never liked.

101
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,913
You know the best?

102
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,030
He asked me to join them.

103
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,355
What a pig!

104
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,195
In fact, it was not too bad.

105
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,829
I had never done a girl.

106
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,109
It was my last chance
sleep with him.

107
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,840
You know, I'll have already spoken.

108
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,232
I know, the Italian Stallion.
But frankly, are not you ashamed?

109
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,436
I screwed up at the door

110
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,750
once
our little affair ended.

111
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,470
It freed me, somehow,

112
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,073
me use him

113
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,470
for one last orgasm.

114
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,799
You can make me a great service?

115
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,633
What, again?

116
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,119
Table No. 12.

117
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,759
Look.

118
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,708
And?

119
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,913
That's him.

120
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,629
Give me 12
and I give you three of my tables.

121
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,390
It is imperative that I serve.

122
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,593
As you wish.

123
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,478
I think I'm in love.

124
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,748
You must not be the only
on the list.

125
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,072
You want a drink
Started?

126
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,874
Chris, wait.

127
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,632
What's up, Dave?

128
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,836
As usual, I have too much work.

129
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,390
To whom you say. I had 3 customers
on the back in two weeks.

130
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,269
I told
not to accept this job.

131
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,998
- How's Tom?
- Good.

132
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,152
Always so excited.
We fucked last night.

133
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,629
Give me the details,
it makes me jealous.

134
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,438
You fuck not?

135
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,399
You're new in town?

136
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,076
It is not very talkative.

137
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,753
Not too much.

138
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,793
I'll inflate?

139
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,234
Do you.

140
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,873
I need a boyfriend.

141
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,519
I wanted to call you.

142
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,069
Tom and I basically
Sunday dinner with the guys.

143
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,435
You can come if you're free.

144
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,828
I do not know.

145
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,514
It was at 20h,
you'll have time to go to the muscle.

146
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,598
- It's here.
- Who?

147
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,273
Cock-of-Horse.

148
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,274
- Is he here?
- Yes. Come on.

149
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,716
Go ahead
I'll join the other side.

150
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,115
Well, you're there. How are you?

151
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,953
- Good. You just arrived?
- I'm leaving.

152
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,111
- And you?
- Me too.

153
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,669
It's nice
I want that box,

154
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,833
but I rather feel
go to a cattle fair.

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,753
You're amazing.
You want to stay single?

156
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,876
No, not at all.

157
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,634
But I'm tired
not to fall on the right.

158
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,313
I prefer to masturbate

159
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,994
that kiss
with a guy who I can not stand.

160
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,512
Can I help you?

161
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,508
According to Tom, you not let
their luck guys.

162
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,911
- You're lucky to be with him.
- Change not matter.

163
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,718
I give them their chance.

164
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,953
I left her luck to Alan.
But it was a bastard.

165
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,839
- And Troy?
- It was a real cunt.

166
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,513
What has he done?

167
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,831
First
someone was greedy.

168
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,389
He met
thinking I was rich.

169
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,754
But you are rich.

170
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,469
Does that mean
I'm looking for a guy venal?

171
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,713
This is not to say that I
I settle down with a poor.

172
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,235
I want a rich,
like everyone else.

173
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,469
For what?

174
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,471
To be even richer.

175
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,553
In your place
I do not throw stone.

176
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,550
How?

177
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,314
You're not really found a spot
free-and-the-penny.

178
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,914
Having written both
our wills,

179
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,153
You should know that I am not
with him for the money.

180
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,392
That is where I am coming.
You're not with Tom for the money

181
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,950
and I broke up with Troy
that he was with me for that.

182
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,599
And my cock, of course.

183
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,355
We know that as a big worry.
You can return to our sheep?

184
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,751
So this dinner?

185
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,710
Promise me
it's not a stunt.

186
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,233
Juror, spit.

187
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,392
He does not understand.

188
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,836
What Tom is mixed, anyway?

189
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,831
They have their own problems.

190
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,791
And they plan
on the other.

191
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,033
They fail
to solve their problems.

192
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,875
Then they organize meals
for people

193
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,271
because they are bored together.

194
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,671
What? Your blacklist?

195
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,034
Somehow.

196
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,509
You've slept with all these guys?

197
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,635
Somehow.

198
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,997
And you've kept their numbers?
I am impressed.

199
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,152
Once I have a new,
I an old balance.

200
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,878
Interesting.

201
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,715
Who is Carlo Gastonbil?
This exotic-sounding name.

202
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,231
An architect. Egocentric.

203
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,872
And Louis? 1m70, blond.

204
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,398
A nice guy.

205
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,469
But nipples bizarre.

206
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,473
There's no Blacks?

207
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,718
I got more Ebony
you, darling.

208
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,076
Look at me like that.

209
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,510
How do I look?

210
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,274
Me not blame your failure with Jim.

211
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,989
He dropped me
or me?

212
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,437
A bit of both, I think.

213
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,632
You do not dump.

214
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,199
This is ridiculous.

215
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,148
But it's true.
It might do you good.

216
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,789
It's crap
Typical of a therapist, that.

217
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,110
Nobody deserves to suffer.

218
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,516
It never happens to you nothing wrong.

219
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,795
I told you, you.

220
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,952
Fuck you!

221
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,516
You remember Pete,
we met last year?

222
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,759
- The guy with the Jacuzzi?
- Absolutely.

223
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,630
He invited me to a party Jacuzzi
tomorrow night.

224
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,268
- You want to come?
- I can not.

225
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,237
Skip the muscle for once.

226
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,038
I go to Tom and Dave.

227
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,112
- Well, cancel.
- It's impossible.

228
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,316
Why?
With me, always t'annules.

229
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,799
Forget it.

230
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,431
I will not cancel this meal
just to go to a party fuck.

231
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,589
I have my priorities.

232
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,389
It is more important
maintain friendly relations

233
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,071
that fuck with strangers.

234
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,395
Really?

235
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,799
Wait.

236
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,636
Joe, hello.
I was going to call you.

237
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,439
"Joe, hello.
I was going to call you. "

238
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,438
I assure you.

239
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,157
Avoid you? Not at all.

240
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,153
But I have a monster job.

241
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,318
I do not understand.

242
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,796
Why I go out with you
if I was not interested?

243
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,071
You do not think I would tell you
if I was not interested?

244
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,469
I'm not playing
this kind of small games.

245
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,792
I have a double appeal.
I can remember after that?

246
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,837
Promised in 5 minutes.

247
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,193
What?

248
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,874
I said nothing.

249
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,557
It forces me to lie.

250
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,070
Not judge me too quickly.

251
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,834
He is too eager, and you know it.

252
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,753
Guys like him
seek dishonesty.

253
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,436
And if I do not answer his calls,
he had better drop it.

254
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,955
I do not understand.
What do you want?

255
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,036
I want a guy who takes me
see a ballet from time to time.

256
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,112
When it takes you not
baseball, right?

257
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,559
You want an athlete

258
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,314
sensitive and interested
to culture?

259
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,072
Exactly.

260
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,917
It is quite your style.
An athlete law graduate.

261
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,991
- I believe it.
- What?

262
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,310
You had to play more
matchmaker.

263
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,153
Is not
to play matchmaker.

264
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,754
- I play matchmaker?
- I do with it.

265
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,558
I'm talking to guests.

266
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,757
Just because that's your style
that...

267
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,956
It may be with someone.

268
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,554
- This is the case?
- I know.

269
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,550
Dave?

270
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,075
I told you, I stay out of this.

271
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,638
Surely the ice man.
Will you go to open?

272
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,630
Hello. The evening is already rife.

273
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,828
I'll take that?

274
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,995
Thank you.

275
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,113
I live underneath.

276
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,955
Super.

277
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,559
So I replied:

278
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,350
"Why you thought I wanted
buy City Hall? "

279
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,599
You're very calm.

280
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,757
Do not tell me that you work
for mayor.

281
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,119
What are you doing?

282
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,555
I work in publishing.

283
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,314
Stewart is an editor
very popular.

284
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,392
- You know Clifford Anderson?
- Sure.

285
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,631
- It is nice.
- It's an old friend.

286
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,155
The edition I have also tried
a time

287
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,073
but I decided
I would rather earn my living.

288
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,834
You're horrible.

289
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,589
Dave, your pie with figs
is a delight.

290
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,480
It's true.
You've really exceeded.

291
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,836
It's Tom who does the cooking.

292
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,274
Really?

293
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,949
A recipe from my mother.

294
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,794
- You should give it to Jay.
- With pleasure.

295
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,719
It's very easy to do.

296
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,915
You're not cooking, you?

297
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,517
I'm just coffee. Black.

298
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,835
Who reveut?

299
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,431
Christopher, cream,
please.

300
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,399
I said to Tom
we had gone to Savannah

301
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,710
and that my mother had prepared

302
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,191
a sweet potato pie
to fall down.

303
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,713
Nice to meet you. Good night.

304
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,354
I'm sure they're groping
Stewart on the couch.

305
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,909
- No.
- Of course it does.

306
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,991
Stewart only
for months.

307
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,072
And Christopher
style is not to wait.

308
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,879
Forget the sofa.
They must be at stake.

309
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,276
- Kiss me.
- What?

310
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,839
Kiss me.

311
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,509
There was garlic in the chicken.

312
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,354
I'm Rick.

313
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,835
Christopher.

314
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,349
I spent a good evening.

315
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,794
So do I.

316
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,872
If you want people to reconsider,

317
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,551
we can exchange our numbers.

318
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,039
Willingly.

319
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,675
Thank you very much.

320
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,914
Thank you to you. Soon.

321
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,673
You find it strange
a guy you hold your hand

322
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,274
and after he disappears?

323
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,113
No. I know guys
sucking other guys

324
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,191
and ignore them in the street.

325
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,080
Personally, I find it odd.

326
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,276
It's not so strange as that.

327
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,749
- You'd do that, you?
- What?

328
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,559
Take the hand of a guy
and not talk to him?

329
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,631
He spoke to you, anyway.

330
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,032
"Nice to meet you"
is not making conversation.

331
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,794
It had yet
commonalities.

332
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,349
- Who?
- For example...

333
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,958
I know.

334
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,591
We're both gay,
enough to make conversation.

335
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,236
The Stewart please.

336
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,389
How?

337
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,950
I have not seen in this state
from Key West.

338
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,509
It interests me absolutely not.

339
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,513
I promise.

340
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,753
Hi, Christopher.

341
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,796
We met with Tom and Dave.

342
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,269
Good memory.

343
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,070
Stewart, right?

344
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,119
Pile hair.

345
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,357
You like to drag you come here?

346
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,920
Not bad.
You just subscriber?

347
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,516
No. My roommate would love
I subscribe,

348
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,834
but the muscular,
is not my thing.

349
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,719
In fact, I came
him shut up.

350
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,559
I'm going.
It was nice to meet you.

351
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,950
Yes, me too. Bye.

352
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,316
You know

353
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,075
I said...
I can call you one of these days?

354
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,229
Sure.

355
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,229
Your number?

356
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,117
Super. Well, I'll call you soon.

357
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,315
Above all, force yourself, you dirty bastard.

358
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,679
You want my picture?

359
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,196
Hence my anger. It has nothing to do
tart with figs.

360
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,917
You do not find
my anger is justified?

361
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,759
Me, I think.

362
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,632
What do you think, Tom?

363
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,355
Pardon?

364
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,633
What was the question?

365
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,716
You like to be a lawyer?

366
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,798
T & P is different
the normal job as a lawyer.

367
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,033
T & P?

368
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,679
Trusts & Properties.

369
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,358
I'm paid to flatter the rich.

370
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,395
It's better than it did air.

371
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,756
Your job should be rewarding.

372
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,472
Not financially.

373
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,839
You know
I thought that call you.

374
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,912
I asked you your number.

375
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,360
You were funny
when we met.

376
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,792
In Tom and Dave?

377
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,879
I was bold.

378
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,912
It's nothing to say.

379
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,992
I do not know what came over me.
Usually I am not.

380
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,989
You had beautiful hands.

381
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,955
I wanted to touch them.

382
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,992
I was a little drunk

383
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,073
Then I moved to act.

384
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,239
It was good.

385
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,715
- A little wine?
- Yes, thank you.

386
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,832
And you, my dear?

387
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,838
A little, thank you.

388
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,638
How do you occupied your spare time?
You like sports?

389
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,158
Just baseball.

390
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,833
Must we go there.

391
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,278
I'm downright crazy
baseball and ballet.

392
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,669
So says.
You have a wedding list?

393
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,750
It was a dinner.

394
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,194
And?

395
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,949
I do not know.

396
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,474
It is nice, he is an editor...

397
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,399
All this I know.
You did?

398
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,312
No, we have not.

399
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,915
- It draws you not?
- I never said that.

400
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,711
You, Christopher Bedford
you're out with a guy that attracts

401
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,757
and did you even try?

402
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,115
Exactly.

403
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,474
Why?

404
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,037
Because sometimes
sex, it can ruin everything.

405
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,590
There is potential.

406
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,990
It can give something.

407
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,993
If he recalls.

408
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,389
Call him, you.

409
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,517
- It was called this morning.
- It is noon.

410
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,716
He wants to be hanging around.

411
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,030
It would do you good, it changes.

412
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,793
What does it mean?

413
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,919
It would do you no harm,
a guy who is not in your boot.

414
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,357
This guy, I feel good.

415
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,876
Before the end of the summer
you scrub.

416
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,112
You have one of those fantasies!

417
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,271
Holding our breath.

418
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,359
For the moment,
is beyond question.

419
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,709
It's getting late.

420
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,593
I gotta go.

421
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,349
Wait.

422
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,471
I spent a good evening.

423
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,868
So do I.

424
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,074
But...

425
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,190
I want to rush into anything.

426
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,995
Good.

427
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,428
Thank you very much.

428
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,195
Good night, Chris.

429
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,588
Good night, Stew.

430
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,438
<i>To let</i>
<i>Your personal message</i>

431
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,591
<i>press the star key.</i>

432
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,155
Hi, guys.
I am a Black single,

433
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,790
30 years
professionalism hard.

434
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,191
I want a man
for a discreet meeting,

435
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,070
vaguely intellectual
and without headaches.

436
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,559
- Who would have thought?
- Do not tell anyone.

437
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,950
Anyway,
I speak only to Tom.

438
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,669
Especially not with Tom.
Stewart and him are good friends.

439
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,798
I do not want him to know
I really feel.

440
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,552
You're in the melodrama?

441
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,392
You can talk!

442
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,915
You were such
when you met Tom.

443
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,038
Guess
you are moved to act.

444
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,993
You think of nothing else
than sex?

445
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,630
I am discreet
my privacy.

446
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,439
Sure.
And I'm the queen of England.

447
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,795
You die of envy
give me the details.

448
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,757
I tell you what I feel

449
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,196
and you, you want to know
if I am done.

450
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,318
I am extremely disappointed, David.

451
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,948
And if you're not gone
in bed with him,

452
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,350
that I will be disappointed.

453
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,193
Everyone knows
you're going fast.

454
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,397
Why do you take me
for Marie lie down there?

455
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,835
This is what you are, remember.

456
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,837
What? Two appointments
and did you score any points?

457
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,989
I'm not kidding.

458
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,232
I am not kidding you,
and it fucks the chips.

459
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,872
Better that I go.

460
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,476
You want to get a drink?

461
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,835
My God, I know.
Everything goes so fast.

462
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,115
- You're right.
- Really?

463
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,271
Do not move too fast to act.

464
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,949
No, of course not.

465
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,832
Glad to hear it.

466
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,031
Make yourself at home.

467
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,992
It's cool here.

468
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,675
You're rich or what?

469
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,148
Splurge.

470
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,629
I love your white hair.
I have a weakness for old.

471
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,756
I like you well, Danny.

472
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,114
This is Donny.

473
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,191
Sorry. Donny.

474
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,991
<i>Donny and Marie</i> Like.

475
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,073
You'll excuse me?
I have to check my pacemaker.

476
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,988
Super! I believe it.

477
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,799
Do not start, David.
And touch me.

478
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,510
Hello. Riding high?

479
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,475
Are you Christopher, I guess.

480
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,239
Delighted.

481
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,994
I'm Kenny, the roommate Stewart.

482
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,549
Cock-of-Horse is his roommate?

483
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,199
When Larry finds out that...

484
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,038
It's great. You will leave
all four lovers.

485
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,235
Go ahead, tell me.
Does he snore?

486
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,397
But as a child.

487
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,954
I think he loves me very much.

488
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,552
When I saw Dick de Cheval
He immediately told me:

489
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,392
"You have to be Christopher."

490
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,833
It was really cool.

491
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,068
It is revealing, I think,

492
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,708
his roommate know my name.

493
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,759
That means that about me.
You think?

494
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,910
Absolutely.

495
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,151
It makes the muscle where?

496
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,234
Nowhere.

497
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,753
It will not!

498
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,038
You mean you saw 2 times
a guy who is not muscular?

499
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,316
Stop your car, Larry.

500
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,517
It is well.
I do not seek perfection.

501
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,752
- You fucked how many times?
- 4 times this week.

502
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,797
- And in the morning?
- It is awesome.

503
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,758
When I woke up this morning
he smiled.

504
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,833
What is a good sign.
He has no regrets.

505
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,035
I hope so.

506
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,398
He kissed me,
and you know what he said?

507
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,879
I was not there.

508
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,235
- Guess.
- No idea.

509
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,359
You never guess
what he said when he woke up.

510
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,510
- You give your tongue to the cat?
- Yes.

511
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,679
He said: "Hello, my prince."

512
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,630
It's a romantic!
I could have died on the spot.

513
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,792
It is so nice,
it makes me happy.

514
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,758
Do you find
I've changed?

515
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,150
I am obliged to say yes.

516
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,754
Really?
I feel a new man.

517
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,798
I had you ever seen like that.

518
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,552
You think I'm in love?

519
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,598
Or
you got a drug problem.

520
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,590
I can fall in love with a guy
which is not a perfect body.

521
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,359
Someone who is...

522
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,634
kind, gentle and caring.

523
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,509
As Stewart.
It was not a perfect body.

524
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,590
It has love handles.

525
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,750
He has a flabby belly.

526
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,719
But he has these eyes...

527
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,278
I love his eyes.

528
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,636
They are beautiful.

529
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,679
My God!

530
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,078
What color are they?

531
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,398
No, really
beautiful eyes.

532
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,189
This is the kind of eyes that reassured.

533
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,789
Super.

534
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,599
What do you know Stewart's ex?

535
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,988
Everything.

536
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,789
Why? And you?

537
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,238
He wants to talk about it.

538
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,748
Without revealing too much,

539
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,593
I would say it has suffered a lot.

540
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,110
His ex has well conned.

541
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,360
- He has cheated?
- For years.

542
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,513
They had alliances,
lived together

543
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,353
had a joint account,
the whole shebang...

544
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,588
Fortunately
they wore hoods.

545
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,672
They still see themselves?

546
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,918
- It has been found.
- Super!

547
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,512
It took me to put its foot down.

548
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,831
I said: "Mr Donnelly..."
- The name of the client:

549
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,357
Mr. Donelly -
I said: "Mr Donnelly,

550
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,713
"You have hired
to work.

551
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,078
"So you think
our company can provide

552
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,240
"Knowledge
in international regulations

553
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,119
"For transport
of your hardware equipment. "

554
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,431
If you had seen his face...

555
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,153
You could have heard a pin drop.

556
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,353
It was incredible.

557
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,599
One of my best experiences
Geizocorp home.

558
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,593
You're hot.

559
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,795
You, you're hot.

560
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,839
I feel an erection now, right?

561
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,313
- Naughty boy.
- You love it.

562
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,038
You should be careful.

563
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,474
Otherwise?

564
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,514
Otherwise, I could
fall in love with you.

565
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,995
It takes courage to say that.

566
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,675
You're really talented
to break the mood, you know?

567
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,874
- Boudin not.
- I do not sulk.

568
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,989
Are you asleep?

569
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,638
You hear me snoring?

570
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,153
I miss it.

571
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,154
My snoring?

572
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,238
Novelty.

573
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,353
They look...

574
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,476
packed one by one.

575
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,517
I'm excited about you.

576
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,399
- But no.
- Really?

577
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,070
Moreover,
You do not have to be.

578
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,269
We have been together for a lease
and you want to look elsewhere.

579
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,556
I want to go elsewhere.

580
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,437
We decided to talk about it anymore
since our friend Danny.

581
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,794
Donny.

582
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,232
It's true, sorry. But...

583
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,838
They looked so...

584
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,230
Lovers? Yes.

585
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,789
Stable? Not particularly.

586
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,476
When have you seen Christopher
be like that with someone?

587
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,952
One thing is certain:

588
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,999
I envy you.

589
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,388
How?

590
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,152
Because if they break,

591
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,274
you'll have to pick up Christopher
spoon.

592
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,198
They will not break.

593
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,679
Hope.

594
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,071
Sorry to be grumpy.

595
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,158
Do not worry.

596
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,513
I used to.

597
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,594
Good. Here I am relieved.

598
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,672
So do I.

599
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,428
I zap the muscle.

600
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,159
I have a party.

601
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,033
You want to come?

602
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,276
With pleasure,

603
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,194
but Stewart and me
it has something planned. Sorry.

604
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,794
Roses?

605
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,629
They are beautiful.

606
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,511
Stewart has sent me
with a poem that I have here.

607
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,869
I'm all ears.

608
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,833
"How to express

609
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,589
"My joy at having
a suitor named Chris?

610
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,873
"The beating of my heart
not feigned

611
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,237
"I drink your kisses
as we drink from the chalice

612
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,590
"You're the one
I want to know

613
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,794
"You're beautiful, you're smart,
Chris you're

614
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,352
"When we're together,
my heart capsizes

615
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,229
"The prospect of being at your side
is a true delight. "

616
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,832
It publishes what?

617
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,678
It works well with...

618
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,116
What is the name
the guy you saw?

619
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,395
Which?

620
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,518
I know more.
The collector of works of art.

621
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,075
You talk about Freddie, the dealer?

622
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,628
Ah yes. So?

623
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,795
It's over. He launched
a Grecian urn on the head.

624
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,837
It was time to leave.

625
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,672
Damn!

626
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,355
I'm supposed to call Stewart
he took his day.

627
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,672
- A +.
- Wait.

628
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,229
One second.

629
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,917
Stewart is there, please?

630
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,910
Yes. Is Ken?

631
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,795
It's going very well, thank you. And you?

632
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,390
There is no better. I
on the terrace of Tom and Dave

633
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,519
watering the flowers and sunbathing.
Want to leave a message?

634
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,917
Tell him I called.
It would not work.

635
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,754
He left racing
it will be here in 1 hour

636
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,834
I will be unreachable.
I'm going to the muscle early this evening.

637
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,872
You're at the Met, right?

638
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,270
I told myself
that I had already seen.

639
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,635
I recognized your cock horse.

640
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,199
Shut up.

641
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,710
You got a hot bod, dude.

642
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,308
If only.

643
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,393
I swear.
How do you interview your abs?

644
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,758
I'll be muscular too, tonight.
We tell our secrets?

645
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,473
You show me your program
for abs, and I...

646
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,469
Today
I am the pectoral muscle.

647
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,597
Great, we have seen earlier.
Hello.

648
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,676
"You show me yours
and I, mine. "

649
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,998
I prefer not to hear.

650
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,230
Go, three...

651
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,068
Super. You're in great shape.

652
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,596
Go to the shower.

653
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,312
A man well done
which we would all muscles.

654
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,435
Blonde with short hair
military style.

655
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,910
I get tired of beautiful ass.

656
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,357
A beautiful smile.
He must have perfect teeth.

657
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,716
From the beautiful pecs.

658
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,314
Pretty and big tits.

659
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,390
He must have blue eyes.
Yes, because it makes me crazy.

660
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,758
I have tremendous respect

661
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,195
for the struggle of African-Americans.

662
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,911
As a white,
I have to fight relentlessly

663
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,117
to free myself from the ivory tower

664
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,874
my privileged existence
lower middle class.

665
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,397
Every day, going to work,
I listen to Black Lady Mombasa.

666
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,148
Really?

667
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,873
If he still says: "I am
a simple man, I vomited.

668
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,079
My mother always told me:
"Love yourself if you want people to love you."

669
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,913
You are cynical.
I find it touching.

670
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,479
Because you come from Iowa.

671
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,790
It is in Iowa?
You knew that, Chris?

672
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,317
Stop the chambering.
It is likely on its origins.

673
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,356
Dessert?

674
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,193
You have cheesecake?

675
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,839
It is a little late for that.

676
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,592
Do not be a killjoy.

677
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,068
Life is too short.

678
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,232
Tom, you take a dessert?

679
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,871
From chocolate mousse.

680
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,632
Nothing for you?

681
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,117
A cappuccino, please.

682
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,597
I would give
for the kids this guy.

683
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,712
Stop!

684
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:38,192
You mean you think so
incredibly attractive?

685
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,157
Not particularly, no.

686
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,992
Why?

687
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,789
Too perfect.

688
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,551
You think they love each other?

689
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,229
Who? Tom and Dave?

690
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,230
Yes, I guess.
In their way, cynically.

691
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,232
I too liked the movie.

692
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,273
I was sure.

693
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,793
It made me cry.

694
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,315
Really?

695
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,309
So do I.

696
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,478
But I tried to hide it.

697
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,353
I noticed.

698
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,389
Really?

699
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,549
Happy anniversary.

700
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,280
In two months our
unexpected happiness.

701
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,875
And commitment.

702
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,314
In this regard,

703
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,433
I have something for you.

704
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,358
Stewart, stop!

705
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,078
Are not you excited?

706
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,394
Sorry, I'm really tired.

707
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,591
You're not even
a little bit excited?

708
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,593
You can stop
talk like a kid?

709
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,159
What is wrong with you?

710
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,878
I'm lame.

711
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,996
We must kiss every night?

712
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,390
No. Once a week
it would be nice.

713
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,835
If a guy is buddy-buddy
with you to the muscle,

714
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,991
that means he is interested?

715
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,749
What?

716
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,674
You think Dick de Cheval
has a crush on you?

717
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,829
I do not know.

718
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,468
- Love you?
- Not you?

719
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,279
- I am not married.
- Me, yes?

720
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,318
You alone know.

721
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,997
I do not know. Kenny my mate

722
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,311
and I noticed once or twice
he touched.

723
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,516
You should maybe you do.

724
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,436
You speak of him
that your man.

725
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,795
- You so...
- It's true.

726
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:51,919
Stewart and me, it's serious.
It has no meaning for you?

727
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,310
Does not reverse the roles.

728
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,792
All this has nothing to do with me.
Absolutely none.

729
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,554
You're my friend, right?
You do not care?

730
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,838
I need you.

731
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:10,473
None of us want
embark there,

732
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,632
then change the subject,
you want to?

733
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,109
Okay.

734
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,470
Sometimes
I want to go out with a guy

735
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,154
with whom I want to kiss
all the time.

736
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,551
Gender,
I would have to keep me

737
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,075
not to snatch his clothes.

738
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,719
And it's not the case?

739
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,719
It's wrong to want to be with a guy
which makes me bend to the muscle?

740
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,836
I am the water retention?

741
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,069
Where?

742
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,312
Here. That is all swollen. Tasters.

743
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,589
What do you think?

744
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,189
You have reached an agreement?

745
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,319
No.

746
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,720
But her last boyfriend was wrong.

747
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,034
And to hear Tom,
it was completely destroyed.

748
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,235
I do not know what to say.

749
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,440
You should perhaps slow down.

750
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:26,434
Love is really complicated.

751
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:32,594
I hope you would tell me
if you found me superficial.

752
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,231
Of course I would tell you, idiot.

753
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,590
I love waking up naked
next to a blonde.

754
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,671
An arsehole rebounded.

755
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,230
From superb calves.

756
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,956
Hairs on the arm
going in this direction...

757
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,112
Beautiful cheekbones
a square jaw.

758
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,959
Blonde hair, short.

759
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,237
Cut very short,
like a kid.

760
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,677
A beautiful smile
with perfect teeth.

761
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,357
We should see his veins.

762
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,749
Large feet.

763
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,589
Large pink nipples.

764
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,353
But smooth.

765
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:18,118
With a nice muscular back
and a nice little ass.

766
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,271
The big biceps.

767
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,440
I may be angry,
I know.

768
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,078
Whenever I'm excited
it looks like...

769
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,073
Talk to David, not me.

770
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,435
Talk to your lover.

771
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,712
I want you to be more sexual,

772
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,428
I guess.

773
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,910
What you trying to say, Tom,

774
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:58,949
is that your sex life
to both frustrates you.

775
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,238
I go to the bathroom, I'll be back.

776
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,589
How many drinks you have buses, Lar?

777
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:59,710
Enough to get drunk mouth,
Stew.

778
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,557
Hello, dude. You're super cute.

779
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,869
Thank you.

780
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,472
He's your guy over there?

781
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,233
That's cool. I also have a guy.

782
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,834
But it is often on the move.

783
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,718
I am very discreet.

784
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,279
Call me

785
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,439
If you've wanted to have fun.

786
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,799
I tried to engage
conversation with your friend...

787
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,393
Do you mind?

788
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,359
You do it block the view.

789
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,116
Sorry, Lar.

790
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,790
Be more forgiving, Lar.

791
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,997
He grew up on a farm,
It captures not always all.

792
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,071
Obviously.

793
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,838
Good luck.

794
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,468
It is I who should tell you that.

795
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:48,994
"It's cool.

796
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,072
"Me too, I have a guy.

797
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,148
"But it is often on the move.

798
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,071
"I am very discreet.

799
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,715
"Very discreet."

800
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,955
Good morning.

801
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,671
Sorry about last night.

802
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,275
How?

803
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,716
It was a bad idea.

804
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:33,148
But as I neglected Larry
recently,

805
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,833
I said...

806
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,278
I know not what I said.

807
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,874
You do not have to apologize.

808
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,038
Larry was stretched.

809
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,633
But I enjoyed myself.

810
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,073
- I would have liked to be alone.
- I understand.

811
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,232
I had forgotten that these bars
it can be depressing.

812
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,828
You go to the shower first
or me?

813
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,151
One has only to take together.

814
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,552
Me apply the cream?

815
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,629
Sure.

816
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,359
Which do you want?

817
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,113
The factor 8, it will be.

818
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,629
Thank you.

819
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,510
Why you never put me,
me?

820
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,837
You've already asked me?

821
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,954
No. She's very nice, Mom.

822
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,675
She sits in front of me.

823
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,829
Yes, I left on the table.

824
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,559
Near the phone.

825
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,112
With instructions.

826
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,075
I swear
it is very nice.

827
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,879
I do not know.

828
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,469
Do not leave.

829
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,392
She wants to talk to you.

830
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,590
I am your appointments 15h.

831
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:01,756
Mr. Pennyfruger.

832
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,917
Call me Norbert.

833
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,749
Hello, Norbert.

834
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,638
I'm not there.

835
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,028
Damn, Stewart!

836
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,156
Excavation not my business.

837
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,270
Okay, I won.

838
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,757
Stewart is always...
Him, he is innocent.

839
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,838
It is the victim.

840
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,037
That's not the victim.

841
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,152
We all have issues
in a box, right?

842
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,674
No?

843
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:17,117
We all have issues
in a small box.

844
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:21,439
Hidden in a drawer
or in a cupboard.

845
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,991
We all somewhere
a box of phone numbers.

846
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,876
Or maybe an old directory
with numbers in it.

847
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,792
But they throw.

848
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,952
You got the time
go drink a beer tonight?

849
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:00,598
No. Stewart us
a romantic dinner.

850
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,188
Match Postponed?

851
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,428
No problem.

852
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,078
Sorry for the delay.
At the muscle, I...

853
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:46,033
Stewart told us about your dinner
then it was invited.

854
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,553
Does it bother you?

855
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,200
There's only like this
we can see you.

856
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:55,478
We have not beep you, Christopher.
It's great.

857
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:59,679
If you buy together
I do the transaction.

858
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,473
What's for dinner?

859
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:12,596
Norbert This is very nice.

860
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,910
But I do not feel ready.

861
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:19,155
And my mother put
incredible pressure

862
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:21,436
for I am with whites.

863
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,433
However, I tried
Blacks encounter.

864
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,319
But hey, it is in Boston.

865
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,278
Or, I have not
Jim is mourning.

866
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:38,789
Maybe my fear
to get involved with Norbert

867
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,032
is one way
to cling to a man

868
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,873
which I know
will not make me happy.

869
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:46,995
Finally

870
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,714
it seems logical?

871
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,909
Does it seem logical

872
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,037
Susan?

873
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:29,750
Looking...

874
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:34,874
I was thirsty.

875
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,033
You're thirsty?

876
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,954
Me, I'm hungry.

877
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,028
Did you hear?

878
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,158
Relax.

879
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,799
Wait.

880
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,439
Come, I know where you can go.

881
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,597
Relax, baby.
You fear nothing with me.

882
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,635
Tom.

883
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,515
Cheri.

884
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,034
- You hear?
- I'm sorry.

885
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,112
It's not you.
There's someone on the roof.

886
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,879
And?

887
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,511
A nice little round ass.

888
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,752
The hair cut short,
like a kid.

889
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:07,350
Biceps hard as steel.
While blindfolded.

890
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,555
Perfect teeth.

891
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:09,876
Blue eyes.

892
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:10,950
Large feet.

893
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,353
The big biceps.

894
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,356
Enough!

895
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,955
A beautiful back.
Large feet.

896
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:21,950
Blue eyes.

897
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,593
The big biceps.

898
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,473
While blindfolded.
But sweet.

899
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,156
Enough! Enough!

900
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,154
Where were you?

901
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,753
I was thirsty.

902
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:39,554
Tomorrow night
could dine with you.

903
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:44,271
That way, Kravitz
disembark not unexpectedly.

904
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,713
No problem.

905
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,269
Super. I love you.

906
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,272
Sleep, OK?

907
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,119
You love me?

908
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,549
Good morning.

909
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,631
Wait, Dave.

910
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,513
Slept well?

911
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,479
I'm sorry.
It happened, that's all.

912
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,629
What? Are you going?
You're a great support.

913
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,710
You know, Christopher,
I hope for you one day

914
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,835
you understand
there is a difference

915
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,390
between spending your time to apologize
and live your life.

916
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,115
Stewart is Christopher.

917
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,915
I hope it still works
tonight.

918
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,793
We dine with me.

919
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,193
Call me at the office.

920
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,074
Larry, you got a minute?

921
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,437
Just one. What is it?

922
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,593
I messed up.

923
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,593
Yesterday evening
Tom surprised me with Kenny.

924
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,073
You say nothing?

925
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,278
It is so poorly.

926
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:32,359
Do not think I have nothing to do

927
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,719
but I have to make this work at 10am.

928
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,594
Sorry.

929
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,470
Stewart is still Christopher.

930
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,313
You have not called, I hope
it's always good for tonight.

931
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:43,631
I'm not going to muscle,
then you can call me at home.

932
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:12,354
<i>I'm not there, sorry.</i>
<i>Leave a message, thank you.</i>

933
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,551
Stewart's me.

934
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:18,508
I called
several times to work.

935
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,277
It still works, dinner?

936
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,072
I'm going home,
then call me.

937
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:48,674
<i>I'm not there, sorry.</i>
<i>Leave a message, thank you.</i>

938
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,514
Stewart's me.

939
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,191
I prepared the dinner, but...

940
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,838
We need to talk.

941
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,433
Then call me back.

942
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:55,192
<i>I'm not there, sorry.</i>
<i>Leave a message, thank you.</i>

943
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,515
Stewart?

944
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,718
If you're there, pick up.

945
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,114
Damn
thou wouldst speak to me.

946
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,316
<i>Go Stewart!</i>

947
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:11,635
<i>Pick up. I know I screwed up.</i>

948
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,072
<i>But I thought we loved each other.</i>

949
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,757
I had a good time.

950
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,675
So do I.

951
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,751
We exchange our numbers?

952
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,870
Sure, with pleasure.

953
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,351
Do you remember me, eh?

954
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,715
How? I know you?

955
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:03,870
This is not the first time, Chris.

956
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:05,879
Pardon?

957
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,392
You really do not remember.

958
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:10,839
It's crazy.

959
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,069
- We have already slept together.
- Oh yes.

960
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:18,516
- Stop playing.
- I'm not playing.

961
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,591
Stop your car.

962
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,717
I'll refresh your memory?

963
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,154
Another day.

964
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,674
What's going on?

965
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:28,909
Nothing.

966
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:38,554
I want to be unpleasant,
but I get up early.

967
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,631
You kissed me 2 years ago.

968
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,037
We met at the Gay Pride.

969
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,109
Remember?

970
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:49,749
We'll talk another day.
But here, I...

971
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,436
"That you reach here." Right?

972
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,510
- I never said that.
- I understand.

973
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,790
You remember.
Ask yourself this problem?

974
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,832
You should go.

975
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,833
Does it bother you not
not even a little?

976
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:09,759
We slept together
and you've completely forgotten.

977
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:12,711
I find it disturbing.

978
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,439
I have not said to have forgotten.

979
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:16,352
Me, I remember very well.

980
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:18,795
- Will you go?
- Not right away.

981
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,591
Now, who plays?

982
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,079
Farm.

983
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,157
You want me to call the police?

984
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,835
I frighten you, Chris?

985
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:35,115
I give up to three
to leave my apartment.

986
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,032
You're kidding.

987
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,475
Un ..

988
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,518
Do not do it, Chris.

989
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,589
Two...

990
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:48,549
Three.

991
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:51,715
Four.

992
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,355
Damn!

993
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,477
T'appelleras person.

994
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:02,670
It can be civilized
and talk like adults?

995
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,236
- What do you want?
- A confession.

996
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,072
That's it. Acknowledge

997
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,197
that you gave me your number,

998
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:17,512
I've called several times
and thou hast never recalled

999
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:20,592
after telling me
you wanted to see me

1000
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:23,115
and that it was extraordinary at the stake.

1001
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:26,711
Admit that you lied,
fuck me at the door.

1002
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,952
You remember, Chris?

1003
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,673
I'm sure.

1004
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,788
I know you remember
for me tight in your arms

1005
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,799
and telling me
that had you ever been

1006
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,792
with someone as well.

1007
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:44,428
I know you remember me.

1008
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,759
How could I forget?

1009
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,158
Me, I remember you.

1010
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:55,869
Admit it.
You've rolled in flour.

1011
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,918
I admit that I gulped.

1012
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,513
Yes, I gulped.

1013
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:04,950
You've pretended not to see me,
but I know you saw me.

1014
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:09,189
When I came to say hello
in bars

1015
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,754
're leaving no
because you not remember me,

1016
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,595
but because you had recognized.

1017
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:29,234
Sorry
if I hurt you.

1018
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:30,993
You're not sorry.

1019
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:34,397
Scared.
There's a big difference.

1020
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,233
"I'm sorry
if I hurt you?

1021
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,356
It is I who am sorry.

1022
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,193
But tonight
'll have you to do better.

1023
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,237
You gotta do better!

1024
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,238
You think so?

1025
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:51,633
You'll force me?

1026
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,995
We play this little game?

1027
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,392
I asked you a question.

1028
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,510
I asked you a question.

1029
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,316
I asked you a question, shit!

1030
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:07,789
You're completely barjo!

1031
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:09,154
Shut up!

1032
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,558
- Fuck you!
- Shut up!

1033
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,556
Try yourself to kill me or what?

1034
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:18,993
I bleed!

1035
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,110
Shut up.

1036
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:21,909
Shut up!

1037
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:24,913
I should kill you, kind of crazy.

1038
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,997
I do not give a damn about you,

1039
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:30,072
or to have slept with you,
or i hurt you.

1040
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,870
I do not give a fuck
what you think!

1041
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,993
How dare you believe
I could worry

1042
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:40,311
a poor pitiful shit
like you?

1043
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:43,399
You're nothing at all. Nothing.

1044
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:46,153
I'm great.

1045
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:47,999
I'm super nice.

1046
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,396
I have money, a good job.

1047
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:54,349
Everyone wants to be with me.
Why I care about you?

1048
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,551
And you know best?

1049
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:01,078
When a guy you remember
after two weeks

1050
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,958
that he cares.

1051
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:06,437
It will neither talk to you, or kiss you,

1052
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:09,717
or talk to you, or even see you.

1053
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:12,269
Put yourself in the skull's it.

1054
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:14,989
I've kissed
I used you.

1055
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:19,711
Got it? I've kissed
and I used you.

1056
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:23,475
You're a shit, a loser.

1057
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,948
I'm a fucking winner.

1058
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,750
I'm a fucking winner.

1059
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,991
And I should kill you.
