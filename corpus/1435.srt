1
00:00:01,738 --> 00:00:04,263
Ah, I see it!

2
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:18,946
Afternoon officer.
Sorry I'm late

3
00:00:19,055 --> 00:00:21,148
Who the hell are you?

4
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:23,191
Show me your pass

5
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:27,290
Oh, the pass?
I must've dropped it

6
00:00:27,597 --> 00:00:31,033
No pass?

7
00:00:31,134 --> 00:00:32,863
Out of the truck

8
00:00:34,537 --> 00:00:37,267
Oh, yes, that is...
Where'd I put it?

9
00:00:37,407 --> 00:00:40,001
What are you doing?
Get out!

10
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:42,077
Right! The pass

11
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:48,950
I'm out!
Whatcha gonna do about it?

12
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:03,589
Son of a bitch!

13
00:01:07,737 --> 00:01:09,534
Get on!

14
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,955
Hurry!

15
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:39,799
Wait! Stop your pursuit!

16
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:46,602
Let's party!

17
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:02,284
I'm told there was a robbery

18
00:02:03,226 --> 00:02:05,126
And what were you doing?

19
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:08,662
While these vermin broke
in and stole things?

20
00:02:09,632 --> 00:02:13,363
How could I protect
something that

21
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:15,199
I had no knowledge
even existed?

22
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:17,831
You are full of excuses
and no results

23
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,975
If I trusted you,
I wouldn't be here

24
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:24,179
The target changed course
towards Bay Area 2

25
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:26,008
As soon as the destination
is confirmed,

26
00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:29,415
I want you to clean out
the whole place

27
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,953
What's with the ruckus?

28
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:39,688
I thought I told those
Hot Dogs to keep quiet

29
00:02:39,796 --> 00:02:42,230
Perhaps they scored big today

30
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:46,301
You're not thinking about
the glider, are you?

31
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:49,260
I'm just fixing it, that's all

32
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,176
Flying that into ECOBAN
is asking to get killed

33
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:57,041
Don't worry. I like living

34
00:02:57,647 --> 00:03:01,481
ECOBAN is up to something

35
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:02,879
They keep trucking
something into Marr

36
00:03:02,952 --> 00:03:05,284
They're probably trying to
torch all of Marr

37
00:03:05,388 --> 00:03:07,379
The DELOS system needs resources,

38
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,219
so they'll burn and
pollute the whole area

39
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:15,158
You're sure you're not
planning anything stupid?

40
00:03:15,665 --> 00:03:18,634
Are you saying
there's another way?

41
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:20,895
We need someone who can get to

42
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,165
the DELOS center without
raising suspicion

43
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:25,331
You want to use Jay?

44
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:29,843
Might as well wait until they
torch Marr to the ground

45
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:32,071
Then forget about it!

46
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:12,179
There're more where it came from

47
00:04:12,255 --> 00:04:15,554
So you got something this time

48
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,593
Wow, what is it?

49
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:26,932
What the hell is it?

50
00:04:29,872 --> 00:04:31,863
What's this blinking?

51
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:33,841
You idiots!

52
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:44,249
- Freeze!
- Throw down your weapons!

53
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:46,878
- On the floor!
- Hands on the back!

54
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:27,094
Move

55
00:05:32,568 --> 00:05:34,365
Get away!

56
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:41,068
Don't make a sound!

57
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,238
No matter what,
don't come out!

58
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:16,639
Perfect time to
run out of ammo!

59
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:19,077
I'll cross first

60
00:06:19,148 --> 00:06:20,775
Watch and learn!

61
00:06:20,883 --> 00:06:23,010
Check this out!

62
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,818
Moe!

63
00:06:28,891 --> 00:06:31,189
Easier said than done!

64
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:34,125
Sons of bitches!
Moe, I'm coming!

65
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:53,715
Zed!

66
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:57,011
Zed!

67
00:07:05,094 --> 00:07:07,756
W-Woody, it's freezing

68
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:13,602
I'll go and get Shua

69
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:17,002
Don't leave me.
I'm scared

70
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:18,868
Don't be scared

71
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:23,239
- I'm cold
- I'll be back soon

72
00:07:24,547 --> 00:07:26,344
Don't leave me

73
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:28,883
Don't worry. I'll come back

74
00:07:29,185 --> 00:07:31,119
And don't sing, okay?

75
00:07:52,007 --> 00:07:54,202
Hush!

76
00:07:55,511 --> 00:07:57,638
Hands on the wall!

77
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,307
One step back!

78
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:02,384
Take them out,
and comb the building!

79
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:04,079
Yes, sir

80
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:50,797
Where's Karen?

81
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:12,543
Woody?

82
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:14,054
Oh my...

83
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,558
Let's go out

84
00:09:18,494 --> 00:09:21,224
I can't

85
00:09:23,165 --> 00:09:25,531
Woody told me to wait

86
00:11:00,296 --> 00:11:02,287
Why won't you die

87
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:06,057
you little cockroach!

88
00:11:06,402 --> 00:11:08,802
Get up!
I'll finish you off this time!

89
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:12,738
You should be thanking me
for taking the fall for you

90
00:11:12,908 --> 00:11:15,433
You should have died then

91
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:18,004
for the sake of ECOBAN!

92
00:11:18,147 --> 00:11:21,878
You mean, so Jay won't
know the truth

93
00:11:22,017 --> 00:11:24,577
That's right! Good for you

94
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,315
Now you'll have to die again
for Jay's sake, and mine!

95
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:42,394
Shua...

96
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,341
Woody!

97
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,514
Woody!

98
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,125
Move! Get out of the way!

99
00:13:23,038 --> 00:13:28,271
I thought it was me
looking after him,

100
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:34,480
but it was the other way around

101
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:41,885
I wanted to show
him the blue sky

102
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:52,866
I'm Sorry, Zed

103
00:13:56,772 --> 00:13:59,468
I'm going to ECOBAN

104
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:01,901
You don't have to come
if you don't want to

105
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:09,916
Thank you everyone

106
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:14,181
First, we need Noah's help

107
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,757
The Hot Dogs are now crushed,

108
00:14:20,162 --> 00:14:24,155
but, Dr. Noah and
his agent remain at large

109
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,635
They're conspiring to bring
about ECOBAN's downfall

110
00:14:30,305 --> 00:14:32,364
Let's not blame security

111
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:34,966
and waste any more time

112
00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:39,212
Operation Marr is ready

113
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:43,574
With your approval,
it can proceed immediately

114
00:14:44,553 --> 00:14:46,987
Expediency would be prudent

115
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:49,813
We can no longer
coexist with the Marrians

116
00:14:50,993 --> 00:14:53,120
And if energy levels
fall any further,

117
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:55,663
many ECOBAN systems
will malfunction

118
00:14:55,864 --> 00:14:59,561
Making it much harder to
suppress the Marrian riots

119
00:14:59,968 --> 00:15:04,371
Moreover, Dr. Noah and his agent are
probably already preparing something

120
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,803
We must eliminate
the root of the problem

121
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:27,319
It's our duty to protect ECOBAN

122
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:31,321
The only thing endangering
ECOBAN is ECOBAN itself

123
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:36,067
I don't care anymore

124
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:39,299
By tomorrow all of Marr
will be gone,

125
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,271
including Shua

126
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:48,310
Even they have a right
to protect themselves

127
00:15:50,152 --> 00:15:52,120
Where are you going?

128
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:53,979
Jay!

129
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:55,950
Jay!

130
00:15:56,592 --> 00:15:58,822
As long as we don't give up,

131
00:15:59,294 --> 00:16:01,489
he won't give up either

132
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:16,121
I'm sick of
this bleak desolate future

133
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:19,923
I just want a sky
filled with light

134
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:24,426
Like that day so long ago

135
00:19:25,534 --> 00:19:27,593
Which is why I have to go

136
00:19:28,003 --> 00:19:31,336
I don't know where I'll be

137
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:35,267
But know you're with
me in my heart

138
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:39,309
Take care of Woody

139
00:20:29,831 --> 00:20:32,732
All troops are assembled!

140
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:35,602
All troops are to enforce
internal security

141
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:38,170
Man your posts,
stay alert, and report

142
00:20:38,273 --> 00:20:39,501
any suspicious
activity immediately!

143
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:42,975
Who diverted the troops
from Operation Marr?

144
00:20:44,145 --> 00:20:46,045
Commander Cade, sir

145
00:20:46,147 --> 00:20:48,513
I was ordered to
reinforce security

146
00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:50,414
Where is he?

147
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:52,953
He went to the DELOS Tower, sir

148
00:20:53,388 --> 00:20:54,719
What?

149
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:58,247
Send the troops to Marr.
That's an order!

150
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,918
Yes, sir

151
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:01,926
Battalion, on the truck!

152
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,949
This war won't end until
we shut down the DELOS system

153
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:26,711
You must disconnect the power supply...

154
00:21:27,122 --> 00:21:30,387
before Shua puts
the spics in the system

155
00:21:30,592 --> 00:21:32,651
That's your job

156
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,685
There! See it?

157
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:03,189
Ready!

158
00:22:03,425 --> 00:22:05,154
Fire!

159
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:30,040
Governor, Operation Marr
is now underway

160
00:22:30,118 --> 00:22:32,109
I wish you luck

161
00:22:32,187 --> 00:22:34,519
I'll do my best, sir

162
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:45,450
That way!

163
00:24:48,156 --> 00:24:50,351
Hey, hey, aren't
we going too fast?

164
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:52,893
All the sooner that
we get to pay them back!

165
00:25:12,113 --> 00:25:14,911
What's the? What happened?

166
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:17,211
There's a gap! Shit!

167
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:19,644
That old man...

168
00:25:19,754 --> 00:25:21,881
Hey! Stop!

169
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,288
He said go full speed!

170
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:19,371
Damn! I must be invincible
to have survived that!

171
00:26:20,014 --> 00:26:23,643
I must have a guardian angel
and the devil's own luck!

172
00:26:24,719 --> 00:26:26,846
Shua! Want a lift?

173
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:05,518
Hurry!

174
00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:03,400
You guys are screwed
once I cut the power!

175
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:47,670
So you finally made it

176
00:30:54,755 --> 00:30:57,246
You deserve what you'll get

177
00:30:57,892 --> 00:31:02,261
This is for the good of
both Marr and ECOBAN

178
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:03,820
ECOBAN?

179
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:06,958
You're ruining
everyone's future!

180
00:31:07,068 --> 00:31:09,832
You're ruining
my future with Jay!

181
00:31:10,838 --> 00:31:14,365
Why you?
Why should only you have her?

182
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:31,720
No!

183
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:36,653
Jay, no!

184
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:43,300
Don't make me do this to you

185
00:31:47,642 --> 00:31:49,439
