1
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,312
Today I will finally achieve
what has been deemed impossible

2
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,359
Man can break the
50-mile-per-hour speed barrier

3
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,273
And you are lucky
enough to be a part of it

4
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,799
"It surely shall, sir"

5
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,309
Yes. We will make history...

6
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,678
or die trying

7
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,914
Die...? This is very exciting

8
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,789
"I refuse to be catapulted
electrocuted... "

9
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,912
or have my internal organs
disrupted any longer!

10
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,311
I quit

11
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,669
He is a very sick man

12
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,319
The electrocution was not my fault!

13
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,313
You refused to wear
the rubber underpants!

14
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,480
Is there no man brave
enough to be my valet?

15
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,676
I'm your new valet

16
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,640
I must commend the valet service

17
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,273
on their impeccable foresight

18
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,630
But they know I only
accept French valets

19
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,677
Yes. Oui

20
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,313
I come from a long line

21
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,597
of French valets on my father's side

22
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,353
"Very, very French"

23
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,079
But your accent...?

24
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,669
"My father French, never speaks

25
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,030
My mother Chinese, never shuts up"

26
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,157
All the children pick up her accent

27
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,354
Are you willing to risk your life

28
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,357
to challenge the laws of physics?

29
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,159
"Yes. And I can sing, too"

30
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,918
Excellent. Put this little hat on

31
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,032
And the throttle in your right
hand controls the speed!

32
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,519
How do I stop?

33
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,399
Godspeed

34
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,989
Twenty-five miles per hour
Pressure's stable

35
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,674
We need more speed!

36
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,912
Forty miles per hour. Hang on in there

37
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,834
Forty-seven...

38
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,392
Forty-eight...

39
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,238
Forty-nine...

40
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,550
Eureka! We've done it!

41
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,109
Good morning

42
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,999
I'm looking for a man
with a steam turbine

43
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,394
There he is! That's my valet!

44
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,473
Sorry! New valet

45
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,389
Good morning

46
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,792
Good morning

47
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,719
You'll be able to let go any second

48
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,399
The pack will run out of steam...

49
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,118
in exactly... three... two... one... now!

50
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,234
We've broken the human speed barrier!

51
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,471
"Goodbye, sir

52
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,160
It's been very nice valeting for you"

53
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,792
Let's do it again soon

54
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,395
"Wait! With you as my brave valet

55
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,160
I can test all my inventions"

56
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,518
No!

57
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,160
Yes. I take the job

58
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,588
Splendid!

59
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,394
I can't wait to present my
results to the Royal Academy!

60
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,917
RO YAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE

61
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,111
And with this grant to develop

62
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,033
new applications for copper wire...

63
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,596
Doctor Ramsey invented this

64
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,473
"Needless to say
the Royal Academy of Science... "

65
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,797
declared this crackpot
mentally incompetent...

66
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,033
and he was duly dispatched
to a lunatic asylum

67
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,515
"Sir, I have an urgent
announcement for you"

68
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,035
Don't just stand there
Read it

69
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,116
It is with great distress
that Scotland Yard...

70
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,479
announces that the Bank
of England has been robbed

71
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,593
My stolen Jade Buddha-stolen!

72
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,596
You blighter!

73
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,110
You assured me that the Bank
of England was impenetrable!

74
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,714
"Sir, I said "impregnable"

75
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,514
"It's the same thing, you idiot!"

76
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,792
"Please, not the quills!"

77
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,395
Lord Salisbury...

78
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,830
"Contact General Fang and inform her

79
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,349
"No Buddha, no deal"

80
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,235
To forego your obligation
would be dishonorable

81
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,270
A woman in the Royal Academy?

82
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,911
We successfully delivered the
Jade Buddha to the Bank of England

83
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,157
What happens while
it's in British hands

84
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,998
is absolutely your concern

85
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,630
"Colonel Kitchner
Chief of Scotland Yard... "

86
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,599
inform General Fang

87
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,234
what other items were stolen
from the Bank of England

88
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,348
Nothing else

89
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,595
Exactly

90
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,988
It seems your little land

91
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,118
dispute has spilled over
onto our noble shore

92
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,234
"Until the Jade Buddha is
back in my possession

93
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,679
you and your cause... "

94
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,759
will receive no British military
assistance whatsoever

95
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,878
"My agents will retrieve the
Jade Buddha once again

96
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,399
Lord Kelvin"

97
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,353
This time do not let it slip
through your fingers

98
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,035
What sort of pathetic man
takes orders from a woman?

99
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,989
Come away from here

100
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,469
"Oh, Dad, can't we stay?"

101
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,116
My wind-powered pulley system

102
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,874
circulates the house with fresh air

103
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,230
Kitchen items are to be placed

104
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,591
on the white boat and
the blue is for laundry

105
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,914
This supplies the house with a
running current of electricity

106
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,511
Electricity?

107
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,151
This is my comprehensive daily
schedule and list of regulations

108
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,239
You're never to divert
one iota from my plans

109
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,999
I must live my life with total

110
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,358
efficiency to maximize
my inventing capacity...

111
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,636
thus enabling me to do
the most I can for mankind

112
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,032
"Mr. Fogg, you are a noble
precise gentleman"

113
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,111
Thank you

114
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,591
"I'm sorry, what was your name?"

115
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,990
Uh... Passport

116
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,351
Too

117
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,636
Passport-tout?

118
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,589
Bottled light. A miracle

119
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,353
Hardly

120
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,752
Just undiscovered science from an
American named Thomas Edison

121
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,638
It turns on with a whistle

122
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,915
Please don't do that

123
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,909
I see your eye is drawn to what

124
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,350
I hope will be my
crowning achievement

125
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,478
A giant moth?

126
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,038
It's a flying machine

127
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,355
It can fly?

128
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,999
Yes

129
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,639
No. But it will. One day

130
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,872
One day it will transport
people through the air

131
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,758
Perhaps over entire oceans

132
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,237
I think I'm going to have
to make a rule for this

133
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,112
Dear Father...

134
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,635
I will find the fastest way...

135
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,237
back to China to make our
village safe once again

136
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,595
Departure for the Royal Academy
of Science in two minutes

137
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,636
Prepare my Urban Transport Device

138
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,998
It's the shoes with
little wheels on them

139
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,108
Clear the way!

140
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,111
Mr. Fogg coming through!

141
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,111
Watch out!

142
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,477
Out of the way!

143
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,873
Fogg's arrived

144
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,876
That makes it exactly
ten minutes before noon

145
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,917
That will be all

146
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,351
Gentlemen...

147
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,789
today I have proved that man

148
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,468
can break the 50-mile-per-hour
speed barrier...

149
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,592
without disrupting
his internal organs

150
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,238
Where is your Royal Academy
of Science authorization?

151
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,789
"Oh, what am I thinking?

152
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,228
What a fool"

153
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,789
That would mean that you
were a real scientist

154
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,355
"By your definition, Kelvin... "

155
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,873
a real scientist's objective

156
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,355
would be to prevent
man from progress

157
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,475
"We live in a golden age, Fogg"

158
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,598
Everything worth discovering
has been discovered

159
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,870
Yet ridiculous dreamers
like you insist...

160
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,236
"on a past filled with"

161
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,877
"dinosaurs" and"
"evolution"... "

162
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,999
and on a future filled
with motorized vehicles...

163
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,229
radio waves and flying machines

164
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,355
Confound it!

165
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,590
The bloody Bank of
England is a madhouse

166
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,472
"Rumor has it the man's
a foreigner, an Asian chap"

167
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,118
Nothing

168
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,238
"I heard it was a Chinese
fellow, and he acted alone"

169
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,476
"Actually, they say
he was Norwegian"

170
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,870
"In fact, it was a gang
of elderly Norwegians"

171
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:46,117
I heard from a very reliable
source that it was a gang of...

172
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,510
red-headed elderly Norwegians
with very tiny feet

173
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,989
"If you ask me, it's about
time someone robbed that bank"

174
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,751
"Like this very institution
the Bank of England is outdated"

175
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,470
"As usual, Fogg, your contempt
for tradition is appalling"

176
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,598
"You rest on your traditions
if you prefer"

177
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,755
"But, as with this bank robber
progress waits for no one"

178
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,351
"So now you're an expert
on the bank thief, as well"

179
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,398
"Give us the benefit of
your ineffable wisdom, Fogg"

180
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,157
"Twenty-six minutes ago
a ship left Dover for Paris"

181
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,789
"From there, the thief
takes the Orient Express

182
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,912
then transfers to a steamer... "

183
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,599
"from Istanbul to India

184
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,269
In little over a month
that man could be in China"

185
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,794
If we're to believe
Fogg's calculations...

186
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,879
he will have circled the globe

187
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,110
and returned to England
in a fortnight

188
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,874
"By my calculations

189
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,119
it would be closer
to exactly 80 days"

190
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,670
Outstanding idea

191
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,878
"Well then, Fogg... "

192
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,478
let's see you circumnavigate
the world in 80 days

193
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,592
That would be a
fruitless use of my time

194
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,115
I'm on the verge of numerous

195
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,277
countless-scientific breakthroughs

196
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,590
You coward. Admit it

197
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,034
It cannot be done

198
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,758
It can! I could do it

199
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,111
A wager. Ten thousand pounds

200
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,233
"Unlike you and your colleagues

201
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,271
money does not inspire me"

202
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,472
I believe every man has his price

203
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,999
"Even you, noble Phileas Fogg"

204
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,594
There must be something

205
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,593
I could offer you that
would be worthy of your time

206
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,993
There is. Your position
as head of the Royal Academy

207
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,475
"With the Queen's ear

208
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,276
I could lead the world into a
new age of progress and discovery"

209
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,708
Fair enough

210
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,199
What?

211
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,999
"I, Lord Kelvin, hereby vow... "

212
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,876
to surrender my position as
Minister of Science to Phileas Fogg...

213
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,474
if he can circumnavigate the globe...

214
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,473
in no more than 80 days

215
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,718
But if he cannot...

216
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,199
he must never set foot in
this Academy again...

217
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,351
he must tear down that abhorrent
eyesore he calls a laboratory...

218
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,470
and he must swear...

219
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,589
never to invent again

220
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,035
"Just as I always suspected, Fogg"

221
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,553
"You promise so much
yet you deliver... nothing"

222
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,589
I'll take the wager

223
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,034
What did you say?

224
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,668
I'll take your wager!

225
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,711
He'll take it?

226
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,549
Then it's done

227
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,233
A man who has never set foot out
of England circling the globe

228
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,838
This is getting to
be rather amusing

229
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,554
"History won't remember your
amusements, Lord Kelvin"

230
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,716
But it will be hard-pressed
to forget the moment...

231
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,237
I'm standing on the very top step of
the Royal Academy of Science...

232
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,719
"by the strike of noon
after I, Phileas Fogg... "

233
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,078
have traveled around
the world in 80 days!

234
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,797
"Oh, dear"

235
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,471
"Mr. Fogg, we're all
packed and ready to go"

236
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,712
Are you in here?

237
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,233
"Are you well, sir?"

238
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,877
Passepartout

239
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,471
Would you sit with me a moment?

240
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,238
"Yes, sir"

241
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,679
I've risked everything

242
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,438
My entire life's work

243
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,592
For something you believe in

244
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,198
Nothing could make
more sense than that

245
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,470
"You're an honorable man
Passepartout"

246
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,956
But I'm afraid this was a
calamitous lapse of judgment

247
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,475
Mr. Fogg?

248
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,716
Maybe we should
let your family

249
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,996
know about there is
no one left to tell

250
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,708
This house and my
inventions are all I have

251
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,991
And a brave French
valet that will

252
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,232
help you go around
the world in 80 days

253
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,790
You really believe we can succeed?

254
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,117
You're mad

255
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,037
We'll be sliced to pieces
before we reach India

256
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,835
Halt!

257
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,031
"Quite a contraption
you got here, Mr. Fogg"

258
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,755
"Thank you, Inspector"

259
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,709
But I'm afraid I'm going to have
to detain you and your valet...

260
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,472
until further notice

261
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,958
This new doohickey is in violation
of the city's new vehicle code

262
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,438
Vehicle code?

263
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,238
Code 431

264
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,030
All vehicles must be
powered by horses...

265
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,319
or other indigenous
quadruped creatures of the like

266
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,232
Excluding giraffes and

267
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,713
You're driveling

268
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,590
Stand aside

269
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,751
I'm about to embark on a
journey around the world

270
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,428
"Not in this monstrosity
you're not"

271
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,999
That's hot

272
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,315
It's not

273
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,111
Time to go

274
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,798
We have a boat to catch

275
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,356
Stealing a police vehicle is not an
acceptable way to begin our journey

276
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,676
Not stealing. Borrowing

277
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,357
Excuse us

278
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,755
We're just borrowing this vehicle
to catch our ship to Paris

279
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,235
If someone could inform the
appropriate authorities

280
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,235
Bloody hell!

281
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,237
My brain's leaking!

282
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,479
Damn that nincompoop Fix

283
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,192
What's the point of hiring...

284
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,709
a corrupt police officer if he
can't even abuse the law properly?

285
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,436
Tell Inspector Fix to pack his bags

286
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,993
He's going on a little trip

287
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,468
"Right away, sir"

288
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,717
Retrieve the Jade Buddha in Paris

289
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,195
As for Lau Xing...

290
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,232
KILL HIM!

291
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,469
Smart man

292
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,188
"Passepartout, will you tell this
impudent fellow that we must leave... "

293
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,233
within 6? Hours or we will miss our
connection in Constantinople

294
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,238
"Please, we are in a great hurry"

295
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,952
"Yes, sir"

296
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,554
In French

297
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,439
You imbecile

298
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,474
What did he say?

299
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,352
He said...

300
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,559
What?

301
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,789
He says not to worry

302
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,195
The next train will
leave in five hours

303
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,833
Good time for sightseeing!

304
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,998
"This is a scientific
expedition, not a holiday!"

305
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,471
I will not miss this train

306
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,873
Very amazing

307
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,234
What does it say?

308
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,117
"This week only

309
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,435
Eddie Thomason will be
showing his new inventions"

310
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,477
Thomas Edison? Here in Paris?

311
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,314
What a chance for you to
meet another great inventor

312
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,115
"I would quite like
to tell him about my"

313
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,549
"whistle" modification"

314
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,233
Good idea

315
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,311
See?

316
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,471
An exhibition. Science!

317
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,871
"I assure you, these are not
the works of Thomas Edison"

318
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,073
I think he's somewhere around here

319
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,992
Wait a moment

320
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,993
This isn't science!

321
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,119
This is art!

322
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,714
Yeah

323
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,110
That painting is highly inaccurate

324
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,232
"It's not supposed to be"accurate"

325
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,317
The artist views reality
through imagination...

326
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,230
rather than simply recording it

327
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,073
It is called Impressionism

328
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,318
"Well, I'm not "impressed"

329
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,829
"Trees aren't violet

330
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,033
grass is not charcoal
and a man cannot"

331
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,473
fly

332
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,875
You feel something

333
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,315
You dream of flying

334
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,675
Or of naked men?

335
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,718
Sometimes

336
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,994
The flying. Not the men

337
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,431
I'm glad you like my painting

338
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,754
Monique Larouche

339
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,473
"Phileas Fogg

340
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,478
Well, it's an awful lot
better than these amateurs"

341
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,831
What did he say?

342
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,754
Oh no...

343
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,991
"Oh, no, not again"

344
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,835
Who is responsible
for this vandalism?

345
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,236
"It's mine sir, does it please you?"

346
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,237
Please me?

347
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,754
You want to hang something?

348
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,436
Go hang people's coats as
you were hired to do!

349
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,555
But sir...

350
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,199
"In fact, don't!

351
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,952
You're fired!

352
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,476
Leave art to the artists

353
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,311
What was all that about?

354
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,232
A wealthy gentleman bought
my painting for a lot of money

355
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,751
Champagne for everyone!

356
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,473
I'm still looking for Mr. Eddie

357
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,560
Have you ever considered a
career in schematic drawing?

358
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,474
No. It would be far too limiting

359
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,230
At least your work
shows genuine promise

360
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,199
Thank you

361
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,714
Because I painted many months
when I was lacking inspira

362
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,957
I found some men to
help me find Mr. Eddiman

363
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,993
This way!

364
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,236
Thank you! Thank you

365
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,316
He's very eager

366
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,357
"It's terrible, no?"

367
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,593
No. It's... clever.

368
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:59,034
"He's a clown. And yet
he's incredibly angry"

369
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,198
The irony's terrifying

370
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,314
Is that good?

371
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,833
Is it?

372
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,997
This is interesting

373
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,998
"But you realize
without opposable thumbs

374
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,792
a dog couldn't play poker"

375
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,433
"Yes, they can. "

376
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,229
"Now, where have you ever
seen a dog playing poker?"

377
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,029
Right there

378
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,199
Perhaps I'm not the best judge

379
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,949
Bandits! They came to take
away all the paintings!

380
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,233
"Look out, my paintings!"

381
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,318
Quickly! Come this way!

382
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,468
Go!

383
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,673
Thank you, Miss Larouche
You may just have saved our trip

384
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,676
There you are

385
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,229
I would like to repay you

386
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,873
Then take me with you

387
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,870
What?

388
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,712
I'm stifled here

389
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,995
Pigeonholed

390
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,680
They think of me only
as a coat check girl!

391
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,193
Why?

392
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,878
Because I am the coat check girl

393
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:35,238
Look what the leading art critic in
Paris wrote about one of my paintings

394
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,832
I can't read this
I think it's French

395
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,319
I wish I couldn't

396
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,232
Why do you carry it around with you?

397
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,954
So when I do succeed
I can throw it in his face

398
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,756
But for now, I need a
world journey to inspire me

399
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,474
I'm inspired to get
us back on schedule

400
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,874
Let's see

401
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,713
Wind velocity
approximately twelve knots

402
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,675
Factoring in air density...
outstanding!

403
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,598
Passepartout! Onward!

404
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,714
There we go
Tell him to keep the change

405
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,589
We are going around
the world in days!

406
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,314
My God!

407
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,239
They are mad!

408
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,714
The balloon cannot
support all this weight

409
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,593
Your hot air should compensate, no?

410
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,549
Get off! Let go!

411
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,239
What are they doing?

412
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,879
They're being disorderly

413
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,314
Hey! Let go!

414
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,836
Passepartout, my valise!

415
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,877
It has all my money in it!

416
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,070
Hey, lady! It's my bag

417
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,719
No, that is my bag!

418
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,228
That's not your bag

419
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,715
It's my bag. You're crazy!

420
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,719
That tickles

421
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,069
He took my bag

422
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,468
Mr. Fogg!

423
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,188
Good catch! Thank you!

424
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,357
Those are the gallery bandits!

425
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,231
The scoundrel stole my purse!

426
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,477
My bag!

427
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,676
We've stolen that old lady's purse

428
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,999
We must help Passepartout!

429
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,474
How do I make this go lower?

430
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,716
What are you doing?

431
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,957
Decreasing the overall
weight won't work

432
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,678
Yes, it will!

433
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,829
Physics, no?

434
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,028
Yes

435
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,072
Bon jour!

436
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,311
Bye bye!

437
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,397
Wake up, lady!

438
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,192
Wake up, lady!

439
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,359
Bye, Mama. Miss

440
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,710
Bye, baby!

441
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,394
Very impressive!

442
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,636
I'd have let go by now

443
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,472
The statue's grabbing his trousers!

444
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,471
I don't think it's doing it on purpose

445
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,350
Oh, dear

446
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,639
Well done

447
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,394
We're still on schedule
despite those dogged thieves

448
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,797
Thank you

449
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,070
Those "art thieves"
seemed to recognize you

450
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,272
I look like someone they know

451
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,276
Some other "Frenchman", perhaps?

452
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,831
So where can we drop you off?

453
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,269
We're not stopping

454
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,312
Once we land in Munich
to board the Orient Express

455
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,749
you are free to go

456
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,757
Thank you so much

457
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,115
For what?

458
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,872
For saying I'm free to go with you

459
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,275
I did not say you
were free to come

460
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,469
I said you were free to go

461
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,868
Where?

462
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,314
Anywhere. Thank you

463
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,277
I will go with you

464
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,193
No, you will not
Miss Larouche, Monique

465
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,310
Miss, Monique

466
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,631
There. Now we are getting along

467
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,269
Look at the sunrise

468
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,752
There is only one word
for it - magical

469
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,798
Miss Larouche!

470
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,639
I refuse to allow you to
continue traveling with us

471
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,392
I'm not traveling with you

472
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,073
I'm making my own way

473
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,118
Maybe you shouldn't travel with me

474
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,716
This is what happens
when you leave your home

475
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,877
You meet... people!

476
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,473
Why are you keeping up this ruse?

477
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,872
Perhaps I'll inform Mr. Fogg

478
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,992
and he and I can
speculate together

479
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,072
A very sacred object was
stolen from my village

480
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,838
I have taken it back

481
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,312
How incroyable!

482
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,754
For centuries

483
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,950
the Jade Buddha has
protected my people

484
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,359
It has never left
our village... until now

485
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,631
Those "art thieves"
who are they?

486
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,074
The Black Scorpions

487
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,313
They work for an evil warlord, Fang

488
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,119
She wants the Buddha so
she can take over my village

489
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,353
I must return the
Jade Buddha to protect Lanzhou

490
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,269
Mr. Fogg is the fastest way

491
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,956
Perhaps, then we can help one another

492
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,398
I will keep your secret

493
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,759
And you convince Mr. Fogg to
allow me to travel the world with you

494
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,998
Keep zis dumkopf in his
seat or we throw him off!

495
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,353
Merely pointing out that if
they coordinated their...

496
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,120
coal shoveling technique
they could maximize our speed

497
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,996
When we reach Constantinople

498
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,156
I suggest you board a
train we are not on

499
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,240
Mr. Fogg, she must come with us

500
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,674
And why is that?

501
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,233
We just discovered that we are
related from the same family

502
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:50,271
I'm her father's second cousin's
sister on my mother's side

503
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,357
French

504
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,074
Monsieur Fogg

505
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,879
if I make the train go faster
can I come with you?

506
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,797
Yes

507
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,639
I bid you farewell
Miss Larouche

508
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,790
If there's anything else
you'd like, just let us know

509
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,712
Champagne with your
First Class seats, Miss Larouche

510
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,231
Merci

511
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,718
No, thank you

512
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,349
Merci

513
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,997
A tea?

514
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,478
Okay!

515
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,870
"How to make English tea"

516
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,588
"Precisely degrees... "

517
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,471
Excuse me, sir

518
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,231
Fogg's valet!

519
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,232
The Jade Buddha!

520
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,590
It is not a Jade Buddha. Yes, it is!

521
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,674
You're right. But I am not a valet

522
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,991
Oh, really?

523
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,989
Bloody nose! Let me in!

524
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,477
You'll pay for scorching my willy!

525
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,952
Now I've got you!

526
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,596
You're under arrest!

527
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,992
Sorry!

528
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,359
Why the devil are we stopping?

529
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,274
Prince Hapi would be honored
to have Phileas Fogg...

530
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,789
and his traveling
companions at his banquet

531
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,069
How very flattering

532
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,119
But please inform Prince Hapi
we're on a very tight schedule

533
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,790
Prince Hapi demands it

534
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:13,197
Then Prince Hapi will
have to get accustomed...

535
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,117
to not getting everything he wants

536
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,637
It is magnificent!

537
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,399
Mister Fogg, his house is
even bigger than yours

538
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,473
His collection! His taste! It's exquisite!

539
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,358
Yes, it is

540
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,199
Not good. Look. Broken

541
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,398
And where is his Highness?

542
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,869
The prince is also a
talented musician

543
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,591
If I did nothing but lounge about all day
I'd learn to pluck a few notes

544
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,830
Let's make this brief
I will pose for a few photographs...

545
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,468
perhaps wearing a turban
holding an atlas

546
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,591
How magical that our
paths should cross

547
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,235
Do you believe in fate?

548
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,473
If that's what you call stopping a moving
train and kidnapping its passengers

549
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,878
Phileas Fogg. Please forgive me...

550
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,275
but I feel like Aphrodite
herself descended to earth

551
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,797
How does a ravishing woman like you...?

552
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,588
I never think when I'm naked

553
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,115
I do. In the bath

554
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,479
No! Don't touch it

555
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,997
That is my most treasured possession

556
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,598
I was only pointing

557
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,637
Don't even point

558
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,074
Rodin

559
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,835
Yes. A Rodin

560
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,235
I've never seen a more
beautiful... muscular form

561
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,631
I can assure you...
I'm in much better shape now

562
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,238
Incroyable! It is a sculpture of you!

563
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,834
Yes

564
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,588
"Happy Birthday, your pal, Rodin"

565
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,590
Come, my dear. Let us dine

566
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,751
Yes

567
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,076
Mr. Fogg, please join us

568
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,313
Sorry. We are on a
very tight schedule

569
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,595
We will join you, actually
But just one drink

570
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,119
After the Duke and the
Duchess sat down in the bath...

571
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,869
I realized I forgot to put
on my bathing suit

572
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,872
I'm such a fool, always embarrassing
myself in front of visiting dignitaries

573
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,309
But you know how that
can be, right, Phil?

574
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,469
It's Phileas, actually

575
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,389
So, Foggy, I heard
you're an inventor

576
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,154
I try to think of new ways
to better mankind

577
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,271
if that's what you mean

578
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,313
I'm not an inventor

579
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,233
but I did develop a new way
of irrigating dry land...

580
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,275
so that no one in my kingdom
ever has to be hungry

581
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,636
Mr. Fogg invented "wheelie shoes"

582
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,759
Not now, Passepartout

583
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,079
Miss Larouche?

584
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,109
It is mesmerizing the way
your face illuminates

585
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,470
Her discoloration could be an allergic
reaction or a mild form of hives

586
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,270
Although I've noticed a glow about her
complexion when she's drawing

587
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,632
Sometimes when she's concentrating
on her latest work...

588
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,836
her ears will actually flutter

589
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,994
It's rather fetching

590
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:17,474
Well, guess who else
was in this bath?

591
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,875
U.S. President Rutherford B Hayes

592
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,793
Shouldn't we be going now?

593
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,154
We have a schedule to keep

594
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,271
Thank you for your hospitality, Prince Hapi

595
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,231
It's been absolutely fascinating

596
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,992
but I'm afraid we must push on

597
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:29,996
Yes

598
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,991
The gentlemen are free to go

599
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,476
But Miss Larouche stays here with me...

600
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,998
to be my wife

601
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,357
Yes. Wife number seven

602
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,079
You have seven wives?!

603
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,117
One for each day of the week

604
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,274
This is absolutely ridiculous

605
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,597
No more talk! Prince Hapi has spoken

606
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,832
Well, we did say "one drink"

607
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,718
Passepartout, we're leaving

608
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,791
I can tell when we're not wanted

609
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,274
Monsieur Fogg!

610
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,710
Will Tuesdays work for you

611
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,159
Goodbye!

612
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,713
Thank you!

613
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,278
Nnnnooooo!

614
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,950
Halt! Or Hapi gets smashed!

615
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:28,478
Please?! Anything but my statue of me!

616
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,990
Miss Larouche, please join us

617
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,316
Drop your weapons

618
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,752
Do as he says!

619
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,310
Get in the tent

620
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,232
Everybody! Now!

621
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,277
Come on!

622
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,192
Now take off your clothes and...

623
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,234
I assure you the statue is not
armed-harmed-in any way

624
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,588
In fact, it's completely

625
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,711
Get them!

626
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,631
His arm!

627
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,599
Thank you, Phileas

628
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,670
That was very heroic

629
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,836
Yes, and needlessly
time-consuming

630
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,714
This is exactly why I should
never have let you come along

631
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:37,358
Kill them! I want my arm back!

632
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,398
Sir, I've received a telegram
from Inspector Fix

633
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,991
According to him, the bank thief
and Fogg's valet are the same man

634
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,393
That numbskull Fogg doesn't even realize
he's transporting the bank thief

635
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,868
Or does he?

636
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,475
He left town in quite a hurry
wouldn't you say, Lord Rhodes?

637
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,395
Indeed, Lord Salisbury. Evading arrest...

638
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,109
and stealing a police vehicle...

639
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,276
sounds rather incriminating to me

640
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,268
One can almost deduce
this entire bet...

641
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,631
was merely a ruse to
facilitate his escape

642
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,598
Don't you agree, Lord Kelvin?

643
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,199
Yes. Brilliant, Lord Salisbury!

644
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,754
I shall name a beef-related
entrée after you

645
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,752
Kitchner? Sir?

646
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,633
Inform your men in Scotland
Yard that Phileas Fogg...

647
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,395
is without a doubt the man who
robbed the Bank of England!

648
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,313
Done. Where are they now?

649
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,115
They're taking a train across India
from Bombay to Calcutta

650
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,872
Thank God we own India

651
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,960
I want their faces posted in
every police station

652
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:45,791
army barracks...

653
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,831
post office, railway station
and outhouse in India

654
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,152
We're going to stop Fogg and
get my Jade Buddha back...

655
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,750
by any means necessary!

656
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,997
Agra is where we will
capture them

657
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,313
Intercept them at Agra

658
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,554
Carry on, Colonel!

659
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,958
Alright, fall in
on the double!

660
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,790
(fall in: Army term
for "form a line")

661
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,116
(on the double: Army
term for "immediately")

662
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,874
They were the greatest Kung Fu boxers

663
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,992
the Ten Tigers of Canton

664
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,635
Brothers in arms, they fought to
keep order and justice in China

665
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,473
The most famous of the
Ten Tigers is Wong Fei Hung

666
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,791
One night Wong Fei Hung...

667
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,271
It's salivating on these

668
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,874
Is this your goat?

669
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,276
Did they really fight like tigers?

670
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,119
Each tiger had his own animal
fighting style. The tiger!

671
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,833
Snake!

672
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,797
Where are my steam
pressure calculations?

673
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,395
The goat! Passepartout

674
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,073
I'm being attacked by a
ferocious animal!

675
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,832
Sorry, Mr. Fogg

676
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,389
Please keep that inconsiderate
beast away from me

677
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,229
And refrain from your
ridiculous anecdotes

678
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,960
Why do you not like
his story, Mr. Frog?

679
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,471
It's Fogg. Phileas Fogg

680
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,553
How can man learn...

681
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,269
to defend himself by watching
animals behave like... animals?

682
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,834
It is a famous legend

683
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,390
A ridiculous legend

684
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,637
Most legends are born from truth

685
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,598
Yes, but all truths are born from facts

686
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,796
Solid, tangible facts that can be
calculated and written down on paper

687
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,753
And then eaten by a goat

688
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,997
Mister Feelsillious

689
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,594
when I tell the story of the man who...

690
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,273
circled the entire world in days

691
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,958
would that not be a legend?

692
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,991
Only if the man's name was Feelsillious Frog

693
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,678
What the blazes is it now?

694
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,799
Get back inside! Now!

695
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,557
Find these men!

696
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,473
Time to go. They seem to think
we robbed the Bank of England

697
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,315
That's preposterous

698
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,836
It's merely a desperate attempt by
Lord Kelvin to impede my journey

699
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,069
I am a British citizen

700
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,559
I have nothing to fear

701
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,319
Except bullets

702
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,997
Seen these men?

703
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,353
Any word on the bank thieves, sir?

704
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,794
They were spotted on the train

705
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,149
Keep your rifles ready

706
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,713
They won't get past us, sir!

707
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,791
Ladies, have you
seen these two men?

708
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,755
Look closely

709
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,711
hey're very dangerous

710
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,799
They're everywhere!

711
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,069
This is not going to work

712
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,157
Stay calm. Just act like ladies

713
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,958
Not a problem

714
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,468
I feel faint

715
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,159
Women are not that weak

716
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,191
No, but I am

717
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,193
Hello, darling

718
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,198
What can I do for you?

719
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,999
Wait a minute!

720
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,952
What are you doing?

721
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,275
This is no time to sleep

722
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,152
Stop! Stop!

723
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,353
Go, go!

724
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,191
Get us out of Agra quickly!

725
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,709
We did it!

726
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,472
Wrong way!

727
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,116
Phileas! No!

728
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,278
Run, Passepartout!

729
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,271
Fogg's valet! I have him!

730
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,113
What are you doing?

731
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,191
Now I've got you!

732
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,958
Hand over the Jade Buddha

733
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,633
Help! You're under arrest!

734
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,950
Watch my plums!

735
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,676
See? Now you made him very mad!

736
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,949
Let's go!

737
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,194
Stop or I'll arrest you as well!

738
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,630
Run!

739
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,628
Which way?

740
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,552
Down!

741
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,479
Jump!

742
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,073
Go, go, go!

743
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,275
What's upsetting him?

744
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,708
He also wants the Jade Buddha!

745
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,990
Then give it to him!

746
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,149
Wake up!

747
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,236
Please, you must go

748
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,956
My husband will be home soon

749
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,994
Phileas! Help!

750
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,754
Fear not! I'll protect you!

751
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,468
I'm here, my dear

752
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,669
That stumble was simply
to buy me time

753
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,997
This cane is not
what it appears

754
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,276
If I press this button

755
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,869
it will deploy a weapon
far deadlier than yours

756
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,110
This is... a strange knife

757
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,399
Isn't it a sextant?

758
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,709
Yes

759
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,199
Are you alright, my dear?

760
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,355
Phileas, it was so enlightening

761
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,709
Everybody, come with me!

762
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,479
You'd better put this on

763
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,999
Perhaps I should wear
women's clothing more often

764
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,393
We should run

765
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,999
Now?

766
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,709
Yes, we should run

767
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,717
Break down the door!

768
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,068
Okay

769
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,674
Not on my brains!

770
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,357
Give me that Jade Budd-air!

771
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,790
Okay. What's a Budd-air?

772
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,792
Get ready to jump! Now!

773
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,756
It is him! The Englishman who
robbed the Bank of England!

774
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,990
He's escaping in that
palki-gharrie!

775
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,236
They'll check all
trains heading east

776
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,677
Even if we make it to the coast
we can't sail into Singapore...

777
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,676
or even Hong Kong

778
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,949
They're both British colonies

779
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,997
Does England own everything in Asia?

780
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,392
Not China. Not yet

781
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,075
You look troubled

782
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,994
I cannot keep lying to Mr. Fogg

783
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,718
You did what you had to

784
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,588
The fate of your village
is of far greater...

785
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,716
importance than any bet
Phileas has made

786
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,471
If he loses, all it will cost
him is some money and pride

787
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,998
No. Mr. Fogg will lose
much more than that

788
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,991
What do you mean?

789
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,993
My village!

790
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,676
Your village?

791
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,797
I mean... "My, what a village!"

792
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,678
It's beautiful!
