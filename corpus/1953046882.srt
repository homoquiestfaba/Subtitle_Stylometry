00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,417
Everybody's got a man
they got to answer to.

184
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,480
I got a man I got to answer to.

185
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,288
- I know.

186
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,557

You got a man to answer to.

00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,486
Me.

193
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,235
I feeI Iike, in this city,

194
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,966
I just feeI Iike peopIe reaIIy

195
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,201
- Yeah, Iife is weird
Iike that.

196
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,436
Sometimes it just
creates situations

197
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,139
that throw
two peopIe together, you know?

198
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,147
- Kinda romantic.

199
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,172
- [Iaughs]

200
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,240
I'm a romantic guy.

00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,252

204
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,155
- No, I couIdn't.
ReaIIy.

205
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,622
I mean, I wouId never want you
to think

206
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,625
that my kindness had
anything to do with, you know,

207
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,456
wanting something in return.

208
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,928
Thanks.
- Wow.

209
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,955

a red fIag on that credit card

210
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,660
that was stoIen this morning
on the subway.

211
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:16,725
Tazza restaurant.

212
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,068
- No squad cars,
no uniforms, okay?

213
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,040
- I'm afraid
your card was decIined.

214
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,137
- DecIined?

215
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,670
- AII right, this is
the universe saying

216
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:30,682
I'm gonna pay for it.

217
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,650
- No, no, I got another one.

218
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,085
Sometimes there's, Iike,
a computer gIitch or something.

219
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,847
That's embarrassing.

220
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:42,019
- Sir, just taIk to you
for a second, privateIy?

221
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,028
- Yeah, sure.

222
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,723
Excuse us for one second.

223
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,530
- The name on this card
isn't even the same

224
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,729
as the one on the first one.

225
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,171
- ReaIIy?

226
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,173
Oh, I'm sorry.

227
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,367
Listen, I apoIogize.

228
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,375
I mean, this is the one

229
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,876
that I usuaIIy put
the $1 00 tips on,

230
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,004
but if you want
a different one, I-

231
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,776
- Oh, yeah.
No, my mistake.

232
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:04,805

233
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,718
- Yeah, I think we're good
Mr. Fujimoto.

234
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:09,778
- It's Fugimato, Fugimato.

235
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,790
- Ooh, my mistake.

236
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,955
- The other day,
I was totaIIy waIking home

237
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,658
with two of the peopIe
from my band.

238
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,325
We were, Iike, three bIocks
from my house,

239
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,857
and I turn back,
and I see this guy

240
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,460
who's kind of waIking
kind of creepy.

241
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,130
- Oan you hoId that story
for one second?

242
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,970
I just have to use
the IittIe boys' room.

243
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,498
Don't go anywhere.
- I won't.

244
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,907
- Excuse me.

245
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:43,444
- Are you having a probIem
with a credit card?

246
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,754
- He was at this tabIe.
- Thanks.

247
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,850
- Where did he go?

248
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,157
- WeII, he went to the bathroom.

249
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:53,165
- Bathroom's back there.

250
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,188
Do I get to keep the tip?

251
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,962
- Whose cuffs are they?

252
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,220
- Bobby!

253
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,454
Bobby!

254
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,062
Bobby!

255
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,223
- What? What?
What's the matter?

256
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,232
- There's a rat!

257
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:30,030
- It's just a mouse, Ma!

258
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,036
- Ugh!

259
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,766
- Ow!
The mouse, Ma, not me.

260
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,569
- It ran over there.

261
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,638
Bobby!

262
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,147
It's over there!

263
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,910
There, it's running.
Hurry up!

264
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:44,916
- Where, where, where?

265
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,418
- Right under the refrigerator!

266
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,477
- It got away.

267
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,617
Hey, you okay?
You aII right?

268
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,654
- I hate those things.

269
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,893
- Jesus, Ma.

270
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,731
You tryin' to kiII me?

271
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,293
If I caught a heart attack,
who wouId pay the rent?

272
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,705
- I'm goin' over
to the church tonight,

273
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,716
and I was thinking I couId
Ieave your dinner in the fridge.

274
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,980
- I'II just grab a burger
or somethin'.

275
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,680
- You want a burger,
I'II make you a burger.

00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,654
I'II Ieave it in the fridge.

277
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,554
- Okay. Fine.
Thanks.

278
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,052
- You got a coupIe of doIIars
I couId use for bingo tonight?

279
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,932
- Again with the gambIing, Ma?

280
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,129
You know
I don't Iike you gambIing.

281
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,137
You want to end up Iike Pop?

282
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,798
- What gambIing?
It's bingo.

283
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,033
It's at the church.

284
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,838
- Okay.

285
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,404
But I'm not paying off
your debts when you're gone.

286
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,312
I had enough of that
for one Iifetime.

287
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,696
- Work good?

288
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,227
- Mm-hmm.

289
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,606
- Stocks up this month?

290
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,668
- Yeah.

291
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,210
- You're a good boy, Bobby.

292
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,932
- Hey.

293
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,634

- Yeah, no, I-Lucy.

296
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,475
I know.

297
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,449
- I'm sorry.
I saw you from behind.

298
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,178
I wasn't sure if it was you,
but. . .

299
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:35,877
It was you.

300
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,016
- It's been a-

301
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,062
- Hi.

302
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,067
- It's been a whiIe.

303
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,329
- Yeah, three months.

304
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,428
- Yeah.
Wow.

305
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,599
How are you-
- So what have you been up to?

306
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,735
- I've been good.
- I'm good.

307
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,142
Good.

308
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,511
- Not much.

309
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,039
I was just on my Iunch break.

310
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,608
- I tried caIIing you,

311
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:10,281
but your phone was disconnected
or something.

312
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,289
- Yeah.

313
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:15,726
Yeah, no, I got a-
I got a new one.

314
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,730
I mean, maybe we can get
together for Iunch sometime

315
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,992
and, you know, catch up.

316
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:20,999
I'd do it now, but-

317
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,763
- I'm pregnant.

318
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,861
- You-you're what?

319
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:26,928
- Pregnant.

320
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,176
- Wow, that's-

321
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,509
I mean, congratuIations.

322
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,980
That's reaIIy great.
I-that's-wow.

323
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,677
How-how far aIong?

324
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,077
- Three months.

325
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,987
- You said three?

326
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,652
- It's yours, Bobby.

327
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,224
- Okay, hoId on a second,

328
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,362
because, you know, we onIy
did it that one night so. . .

329
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,565
- ActuaIIy, we did it
a few times that night.

330
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,632
- Right, but we onIy did it
that one night.

331
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,506
WeII, once is enough.

332
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,340
- Okay, uh. . .

333
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,680
WeII, how do you know
it's mine?

334
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,880
Hey! Hey!
That's a Iegitimate question.

335
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,356
- What, you just think
I sIeep around?

336
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,688
You think I'm a sIut
or something?

337
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,318
- WeII, we had
a one-night stand, so given-

338
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,852
- You had a one-night stand.
I tried caIIing you.

339
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,653
- Hey, Iisten, Iisten.

340
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,097
- Don't touch me.
Don't ever touch me again.

341
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,657
- Excuse me.
Is everything okay?

342
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,532
- Look, it's fine.
She's my girIfriend.

343
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,663
- Oh, that's a Iaugh!

344
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,263
- It's okay, officer.

345
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,934
What are you trying to do,
get me arrested?

346
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,068
Now, Iisten, you came
Iooking for me.

347
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,738
I'm not gonna go chasing you
aII over town.

348
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,542
If you don't want to taIk to me,
then fine.

349
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,243
- First of aII,
I didn't go Iooking for you.

350
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,252
I pretty much wrote you off
three months ago.

351
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,719
I happened to see you
standing there,

352
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:49,948
thought maybe you'd Iike to know

353
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,717
you're gonna have a kid
out there in the worId

354
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:52,951
in case you bump into it
one day.

355
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,118
So now you know.

356
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,094

00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:43,936
Okay, weII, what if I paid cash?

533
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,602
I mean, can we work a deaI

534
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,338
HeIIo?
HeIIo?

535
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,687
- I just came by

536
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,988
Bobby, can you just
say something?

537
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,859
- Or what?

538
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,228
You gonna have your boyfriend
beat me up?

539
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:10,496
- He's a good man.
He needs me.

540
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,697
- What about me, Ma?

541
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,400
I need you.

542
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,204
- No, you don't.

543
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,177
You're taking care of me.

544
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,202
I don't want you
to have to take care of me.

545
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,306
With OarI,
we take care of each other.

546
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,543
- Oh, yeah?

547
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,710
Is that the arrangement you made
with your bingo buddy?

548
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,219
- I Iove him, Bobby.

549
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,415
Not the way I Ioved your father

550
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,822
and not the way I Iove you.

551
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:34,847
It's a different Iove.

552
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,991
Maybe someday
you'II meet somebody,

553
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:40,862
and you'II understand.

554
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,026
You'II know.

Look, he wants to invite you

Here's the number.

00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:57,180

Hey, Jax.

- I don't know.

590
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:22,790
I have no idea how they know.

591
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,802
Maybe it was your IittIe
girIfriend ratted you out.

592
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,133
- She doesn't know what I do.

- No, I'm not gonna

611
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,026

612
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,101
Prick!
You think I need you?

613
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,732
I can just go pick

617
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,114
- Hey, Bobby.

618
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,845
If I were you,
I'd stay off the subway.

619
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,874
Take a taxi.

620
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,216

Lucy.

633
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,256
- Why are you whispering?

634
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,960

645
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,918
Maybe I can come in

646
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:04,985
for a drink or something.

647
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:08,089
- In case you haven't noticed,

- You got a cigarette?

655
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,322
- Pregnant women don't smoke.

656
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,369

00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,772

- I know a few things.

664
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:18,124

00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,466

666
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,300
in the middIe of the night?

667
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,813
- I got evicted.

668
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,583
- Okay.

669
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:50,723
- Oan I ask you a question?

670
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,465
That Fred FIintstone guy
your boyfriend?

671
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,409
- Why?
Are you jeaIous?

672
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,174
- Ourious.

673
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,546
- No, he's not.

674
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,574
I mean, he used to be.

675
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,882
He, um. . .

676
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,388
He just Iooks out for me now.

677
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,392
Protective oIder brother.

678
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,654
In fact,
he'd probabIy kiII you

679
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,685
if he knew you were here
right now,

680
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:22,495
especiaIIy if he knew you were
the one that knocked me up.

681
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,023
- He knows about. . .

682
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,203
- Yeah.

683
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,600
Why are you so curious
about him?

684
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,872
- I don't know.

685
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:37,278
Just, you know,

686
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,044
he's a Iot different than me,
right?

687
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,517
So I was just wondering,

688
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:44,385
that night, you know, you-

689
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,481
I mean, if that's the type
you Iike then why. . .

690
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,419
Forget it.

691
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:57,327
- You asking me why I went home
with you that night?

692
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,202
- Yeah.

693
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,242
- I've been asking myseIf that
every day for three months.

694
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,258
It was your eyes.

695
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,658
- My eyes?

696
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,991
- Yeah.

697
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,860
Yeah.

698
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:28,091
I Iiked your eyes.

699
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,623
You had reaIIy kind eyes.

700
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:34,069
It kind of reminded me
of my father's.

701
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,335
- So you went home with me
because I had nice eyes.

702
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,602
- Kind eyes.

703
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:43,443
PIus, you know,
I Iiked taIking to you.

704
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:46,075
I thought you were funny
and nice,

705
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,813
and you had a great ass.

706
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,790
I Iet you waIk me home,
didn't I?

707
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,590
- Yeah.

708
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,062
Yeah.

709
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:03,828
- And then when we
got to my apartment,

710
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,426
you didn't even
try anything.

711
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:11,203
You just smiIed and thanked me
for a great time

712
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,368
and said. . .

713
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,434
- ''Good night.''

714
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:18,181
- And I don't know;

715
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:21,946
I guess I just didn't want
the night to end.

716
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:29,992
But Iooking back, I shouId've
ended it a Iot sooner,

717
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:32,928
about three minutes sooner,
if I remember correctIy.

718
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,858
Speaking of minutes,

719
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,425
yours is up.

720
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,405
Look, I got a big day tomorrow,
so, you know.

00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,338
And, Iisten, you don't, um. . .

722
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,403
You don't have to go with me.

723
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,971
You know, you can just
drop the money off

724
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,915
and teII me where to go
in the morning.

725
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,577
- I toId you I was taking you
to a good doctor,

726
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,142
and I'm taking you, okay?

727
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:59,486
And that means
taking you personaIIy.

728
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:01,081
- WeII, you don't have to.

729
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,821
- WeII, I am.

730
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,728
So we'II meet at a 1 :45?

731
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,527
It's on 39th street
and 5th avenue.

732
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:09,897
It's caIIed EImsview, okay?

733
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,060
- Yeah, okay, fine.

734
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,878

Hey, Lucy.

740
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:23,828
It's Bobby.
I got a probIem.

741
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:26,199
- So Iet me get this straight.

742
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,568
The money is
in your apartment,

743
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,631
but you want me
to go get it.

744
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:32,005
- That's right.

745
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,737

sees you,

he'II caII the cops

747
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,403
on account that you owe him
rent money.

748
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,314
- That's right.

749
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,978
- So you want me sneak
into your apartment

750
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:42,986
and get the money,

751
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,112
and if anyone sees me,

752
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:45,781
I'm supposed to say
I'm the cIeaning Iady?

753
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:48,451
- That's right.
- Oh, hmm. Yeah.

754
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,221
And none of this sounds fishy
to you?

755
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,156
- Okay, you're right.
That sounds stupid.

756
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:55,790
Just, uh. . .

757
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,528
Okay, teII them
you're visiting your aunt.

758
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:58,728
- No, wait, I aIready used that.

759
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,794
Oh, just go with
the cIeaning Iady, okay?

00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:02,032
That'II work.

Just teII them
you're the cIeaning Iady, okay?

762
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:05,998
And if anybody asks,
you don't know me,

763
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,442
and you don't know where I am.

764
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,639

how wouId I know where you are?

That's my apartment.

00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:18,149
These are my keys,
and it's my money.

770

Now, if I couId
get the money myseIf,

00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:20,988
I wouId, but I can't.

772
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:22,993
So, you know, if you don't
want to do it, that's fine,

773
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,858

00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:39,128
- No.
- No.

884
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,129
- No?
You want to stay?

885
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:42,563
- Yeah, no, we'II just wait
for my mom.

886
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,964
- AII right.

887
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,467
Oh.

888
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:47,868
Gee, Bob, I'm sorry.

889
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:49,132
Look, um. . .

890
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:51,402
I Iove your mother,
and I'm very protective;

891
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,408
that's aII.

892
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,636
- Me too.

893
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:56,876
Smarmy asshoIe.

894
00:51:58,381 --> 00:51:59,507
- SpiII it.

895
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:01,813
- What?
What do you want to know?

896
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:03,376
- What do I want to know?

897
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,856
Uh, gee, why have we been chased
by the cops?

898
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,755
What kind of troubIe
did you get me into?

899
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:09,884
Who's OarI?

900
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:11,188
And who the heII are you?

901
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:12,718
- OarI is my mother's
boyfriend.

902
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:14,423
She just moved in here
with him.

903
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,762
- Right.
And the cops?

904
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,893
- I don't exactIy work
on WaII Street.

905
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,425
- Mm-hmm.

906
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,295
So I can ruIe out
insider trading.

907
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:35,283
- I'm a pickpocket.

908
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:39,846
- [Iaughs]

909
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,653
- What's so funny?

910
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,989
- A pickpocket?

911
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:45,995
And that's why haIf
the New York poIice force

912
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:47,155
is after you?

913
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:49,131
- You heard about the cop
who got his badge picked?

914
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,639
- Oh, wow.

915
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,115
This is great.

916
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,481
ReaIIy.

917
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,681
My kid's father steaIs
out of oId Iadies' handbags.

918
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,712
- Hey, I never took from anybody

919
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:15,622
who Iooked Iike
they had Iess than me, okay?

920
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,354
- Oh, you're a reguIar
Robin Hood.

921
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:19,954
- You know, you don't know
my situation.

922
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:21,361
- Yeah, you're right.

923
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:22,660
I don't know you at aII.

924
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,030
- What are you taIking about?

925
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:25,898
I'm the same guy you met
that night at the bar,

926
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:28,200
except I have a different job
than you thought.

927
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,035
- Are you insane?

928
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:31,631
That's not a job, Bobby.

929
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:32,642
You steaI.

930
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:34,007
- Okay, don't do that.

931
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,204
Don't-don't judge me.

932
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:37,645
My father Ieft me with 500 grand
in gambIing debts

933
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:38,978
and a mother who didn't work.

934
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:40,039
I had no choice.

935
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:47,418
- Why didn't you just
go to the cops?

936
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:49,391
- Because he threatened
to kiII my mother.

937
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:56,959
- Why do you steaI now?

938
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,900
- I stiII owe him about 1 00K.

939
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,631
- Oh.

940
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,564
- Oh, come on,
what-what are you doing?

941
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:07,099
- I'm taking the money.

942
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:08,838
I'm not bringing a kid
into this worId

943
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:10,175
so they can go visit
their father

944
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:11,874
at the state pen
during Ohristmas.

945
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:18,180
Where'd you put it?

946
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:20,485
- It's in the jacket.

947
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,923
- No, it's not.

948
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:24,449
- What are you taIking about?

949
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:28,221
- It's not in here.

950
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,232
- What did you do with it?

951
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,233
Did you Iose it?

952
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,427
- What do you mean,
did I Iose it?

953
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:32,560
It was in your jacket.

954
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,763
- When you were beating the crap
out of me at the hospitaI.

955
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:36,362
You took it, remember?
- I didn't take it.

956
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:37,896
You grabbed my arms
and kissed me, remember?

957
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:47,908
Maybe it feII out
in the cab.

958
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,114
Or when that guy
bumped into you or something.

959
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:52,815
- [sighs]

960
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:58,657
- [Iaughs]

961
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,458
Oh, that's cIassic.

962
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:02,988
A pickpocket who gets
pickpocketed.

963
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:07,760
Jesus.

964
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,738
- Reach for the sky

965
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:12,173
and empty out your pockets,
Mister.

966
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:13,175
- Too Iate for that.

967
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:15,336
- Bobby.
You're earIy.

968
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:16,504
Where's OarI?

969
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:17,604
- Store.

970
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,638
- Go pIay with your IittIe
furry friends.

971
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:22,174
Hi.
I'm Bobby's mother, Rita.

972
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:23,242
- I'm Lucy.

973
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:27,120
- Wow.

974
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,351
I can't remember the Iast time

975
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:29,790
Bobby brought a girI home
to meet me.

976
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:30,850
- You must be-

977
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:32,862
- Leaving, Mom.
She was just Ieaving.

978
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:33,863
She's just a friend.

979
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:35,865
Listen, uh. . .
I'II-I'II come by Iater.

980
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:36,957
We'II taIk about the thing.

981
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,160
- Wait, wait.
Don't be so rude.

982
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,362
Maybe she'd Iike
to stay for dinner.

983
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:42,735
I'm gonna make some Iasagna.

984
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:45,263
It's Bobby's favorite.

985
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:46,969
- Mmm.
Yummy.

986
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,102
I'd Iove to.

987
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:49,111
- Yeah?
Great.

988
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:50,112
I'II go start.

989
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,909
Okay.
I'II heIp.

990
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:54,610
- You that hungry?
- I am eating for two.

991
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:57,677
- Just don't say anything
to my mother.

992
00:55:57,721 --> 00:56:00,656
- Oh, now why wouId I want
to upset Grammie?

993
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,524
- Hey, Mister, do you want
to pIay a board game?

994
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:10,931
- No.

995
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,025
- A video game?

996
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,057
- No.

997
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:15,628
- How about cops and robbers?

998
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:17,697
- DefiniteIy no.

999
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:32,748
- So how do you know my Bobby?

1000
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,388
- We, um. . .

1001
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:37,791
We have a mutuaI friend.

1002
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,089
- Ah.

1003
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:46,259
You know, I think Bobby
reaIIy Iikes you.

1004
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:47,769
- What makes you say that?

1005
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,203
- WeII, he aIways gets
so frustrated

1006
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,173
around girIs he reaIIy Iikes.

1007
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:54,301
It's Iike he doesn't want to
show them he cares about them.

1008
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,209
You know how boys are.

1009
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,806
AIways puIIin' the pigtaiIs
of the girIs they Iike.

1010
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,016
- Orap?
- It's caIIed craps.

1011
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,314
That's the name of the game,
okay?

1012
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:05,321
It's a very serious game.

1013
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:07,721
7 and 1 1 on the first roII wins.

1014
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,588
2, 3, 1 2 Ioses
on the first throw.

1015
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:12,993
After that, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 1 0,
that becomes your point.

1016
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,223
You got to hit your point
to win.

1017
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,824
If you hit a 7 after that,
then you crap out, aII right?

1018
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:17,833
Nicky, you go first.

1019
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:18,834
No, no, no, wait.

1020
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:20,028
We have to pIace our bets, okay?

1021
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:21,036
PIace your bets,
boys!

1022
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,037
There you go.

1023
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:23,936
RoII the dice.

1024
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:24,940
AII right, 4.

1025
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:27,204
That's what we caII LittIe Joe,
okay?

1026
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:28,676
So now you got to hit
LittIe Joe to win.

1027
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:30,576
Now, you can have fun with it.
BIow into the dice.

1028
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,171
Oome on, LittIe Joe!
Oome on, LittIe Joe!

1029
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,080
- Oome on, LittIe Joe!
Oome on, LittIe Joe!

1030
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:38,053
I win!

1031
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:39,145
- No, no, no, you Iose.

1032
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:40,247
That's a-that's a crap out.

1033
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,257
We get your candy.

1034
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,816
See what happens
when you gambIe?

1035
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,054
AII right, now you pIay.

1036
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:46,083
- Hey, Iady.

1037
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,723
You want a piece of the action?

1038
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:51,256
- No, I've had enough action
for one day.

1039
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,268
Thank you.

1040
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,326
- Okay.

1041
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:56,805
Rita,
I got the fresh pomodoro.

1042
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,400
- She's in the kitchen.
I'II heIp you.

1043
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:00,966
- No, no, I got it.

1044
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:04,241
Besides, mi casa su casa.

1045
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,679
And I got an excuse now

1046
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:09,014
to go see the most
beautifuI girI in the worId.

1047
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:10,019
Hey, baby.

1048
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:13,682
- Jesus' name we pray.
- Amen.

1049
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:15,247
- Amen.

1050
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:16,883
- Amen.

1051
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:26,399
- So, Bob, Rita teIIs me
you work in stocks.

1052
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,960
- Yep.

1053
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:31,701
- And how's that going for you?

1054
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:34,175
- It's got its ups and downs.

1055
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:35,768
- ActuaIIy, weren't you just
teIIing me

1056
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:38,042
you were having troubIe
paying your rent IateIy?

1057
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,145
- WeII, if you're ever Iooking
for a steady gig,

1058
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,213
you can come down and see me.

1059
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,724
Give me a caII.

1060
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:50,419
- OarI owns
a jeweIry store downtown.

1061
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:53,258
- Diamonds are a girI's
best friend, right, Grampie?

1062
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:54,524
- Yep.
And?

1063
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:56,464
- Don't buy retaiI.

1064
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:58,831
- WeII, I'II keep it in mind.

1065
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,426
- And If you know anybody

1066
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,496
who's Iooking
for a nice engagement ring,

1067
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,564
teII OarI.

1068
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,311
He'II give you a good price.

1069
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:12,507
- Thanks, Mom.

1070
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:15,245
- Lucy's a professionaI
photographer.

1071
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:16,650
- Oh, no.

1072
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:18,916
- Is that right?

1073
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:21,014
- MostIy freeIance.

1074
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,389
But right now, I'm working
in a bar part-time.

1075
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:25,053
You know, it's not much,

1076
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:27,756
but at Ieast
it's an honest Iiving.

1077
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:30,266
- You're right about that.

1078
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,165
Rita said you were from Texas.

1079
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:33,691
- Mm-hmm.

1080
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,601
Yeah, I'm actuaIIy
heading back this Saturday.

1081
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:37,572
- Wow, that's too bad.

1082
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,438
Yeah, I think I'm gonna,
you know,

1083
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:41,238

1084
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:42,244

1085
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:44,041
at a photography studio
shooting portraits.

1086
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,105
That sort of thing.

1087
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:53,121
- And you were pIanning
on teIIing me when?

1088
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:56,455
- WeII, I wasn't reaIIy pIanning
anything with you.

1089
00:59:58,761 --> 00:59:59,785
- How's the Iasagna?

1090
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:01,592
- It's deIicious.

1091
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:02,598
- WonderfuI.

1092
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:04,463
- [cIears throat]

1093
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,403
Excuse me.

1094
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,802
- Do you need to use
the Iadies' room?

1095
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:09,896
- No.

1096
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,429
- We don't got a Iadies' room.

1097
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:12,634
Grampie's onIy got a bathroom.

1098
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,336
- [grunts]

1099
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:17,141
- Lucy, are you okay?

1100
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,147
What's the matter?

1101
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:19,148
Hey, hey!

1102
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:20,308
- OaII 91 1 !
- Breathe.

1103
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,250
[panting]

1104
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,310
- I'm not going into Iabor,
you moron.

1105
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,083
I'm onIy
three months pregnant!

1106
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,316
- Bobby!

1107
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:29,552
- Ma. . .

1108
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:31,617
Oh, shit.

1109
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:39,066
- Why didn't you teII me, Bobby?

1110
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:40,831
- I didn't want
to worry you, Ma.

1111
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,132
- What worry me?

1112
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:44,469
Why wouId havin'
a grandkid worry me?

1113
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,104
Does she want to keep it?

1114
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:51,805
- I don't know.

1115
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:55,806
- Do you Iove her?

1116
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:01,690
- I don't know, Mom.

1117
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:05,421
I mean, I don't know
what Iove is.

1118
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:08,123
How do you-
how do you know?

1119
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,189
- WeII, when she said
she was Ieaving on Saturday,

1120
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:12,667
how'd that make you feeI?

1121
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:14,932
- Sick.

1122
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:16,632
- And when we were on our way
to the hospitaI,

1123
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,935
how did you feeI?

1124
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,908
Sometimes it takes
aImost Iosing what we have

1125
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:25,004
to make us reaIize
how Iucky we are to have it.

1126
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:28,973
Dr. PhiI.

1127
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,455
I'm gonna get going.

1128
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:36,048
I'II Ieave you two aIone.

1129
01:01:58,014 --> 01:02:00,346
- Hey.

1130
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,907
- Hi.

1131
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,587
- The doctors said
you're gonna be okay.

1132
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:09,818
They said you just need to rest.

1133
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:13,389
- What about the baby?

1134
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:16,089
- The baby's gonna be okay.

1135
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:20,896
What?

1136
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:23,269
Hey. Don't worry.
The baby's gonna be okay.

1137
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:25,536
You're gonna be fine.

1138
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,566
- I just thought it wouId
take care of itseIf.

1139
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:33,877
I just-I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

1140
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,646
- Hey, Iisten,
what we're gonna do.

1141
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:39,450
It's not just you anymore.
It's us.

1142
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:40,956
Right?

1143
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:43,686
- Oome on, Bobby.

1144
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:46,092
You don't want to have a kid.

1145
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:47,221
We bareIy know each other.

1146
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,561
I mean, you couIdn't even
remember my name

1147
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,930
a few a days ago.

1148
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:56,769
- Is that what you think?

1149
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:59,900
That I couIdn't remember
your name?

1150
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,704
You want to know the truth?

1151
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:06,647
- Yeah, the truth wouId be nice
for once.

1152
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:11,448
- Okay.

1153
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,615
Okay. Fine.

1154
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:16,454
After that night,

1155
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:20,656
I couIdn't stop
thinking about you.

1156
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:23,722
I thought about you so much,
I was going nuts.

1157
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:25,256
I mean, I finaIIy had you
out of my head,

1158
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,735
and then there you were
right in front of me.

1159
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:33,599
I got so nervous,
I couIdn't even taIk.

1160
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,008
- Why didn't you caII me?

1161
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:39,675
- I was scared.

1162
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:42,843
When I woke up that morning,

1163
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:46,616
I Iooked over,
and you were so beautifuI.

1164
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:50,490
You're so beautifuI.

1165
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:53,825
First time
I didn't want to Ieave.

1166
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:57,060
That's never happened
to me before.

1167
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:58,760
I went to write down
my reaI number

1168
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:00,029
on a piece of paper,
and then I-

1169
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:02,195
I crumpIed it up,

1170
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:03,535
and I wrote
a fake number instead.

1171
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:06,542
Then I-then I wrote
my reaI number down.

1172
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:08,373
I crumpIed that up,
and, I don't know,

1173
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:10,743
I must have gone back and forth
and done that, Iike, ten times.

1174
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,907
And then I finaIIy took aII
the crumpIed pieces of paper,

1175
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:14,143
and I put it in my pocket,

1176
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,377
and when I went to Ieave,

1177
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:17,113
I picked one out,
and I thought,

1178
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:18,518
''Hey, if this is
the reaI number,

1179
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:19,748
then it's meant to be.''

1180
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,355
I kind of Iet fate decide,
you know?

1181
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:28,321
I know.

1182
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,332
I'm an asshoIe.

1183
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:31,458
It was stupid.

1184
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,468
I regretted it, but. . .

1185
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,439
I didn't forget your name, Lucy.

1186
01:04:38,474 --> 01:04:39,941
I couIdn't.

1187
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:41,876
I tried.
BeIieve me.

1188
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,679
- Why shouId I beIieve you?

1189
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:58,359
- I been carrying around that
for three months.

1190
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:01,363
I have probIems
with commitment.

1191
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,661
- Yeah, I know.

1192
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:05,929
You can't even commit
to a brand of cigarettes.

1193
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:14,200
- I'm not gonna run away
from this, okay?

1194
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,540
That's my commitment to you.

1195
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:20,272
- I can't be with someone
who steaIs from peopIe.

1196
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:21,340
- Then I'm done.

1197
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:23,784
I'II quit.

1198
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:26,185
Give me a chance, okay?
I'II prove it to you.

1199
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:28,053
Just give me a chance.

1200
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,352
- And you'II quit?

1201
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:31,656
You can quit just Iike that?

1202
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:33,423
For me?

1203
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:41,265
Okay.

1204
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:50,311
- Hey, hey, you guys.

1205
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:51,574
Get a room.

1206
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:55,414
Visiting hours are over,
and you need your rest.

1207
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:11,418
- You're in
with the cops, Jax?

1208
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:18,624
You're in with the cops?
You?

1209
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:20,060
- Shut up!

1210
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,256
I shouId kiII you
right now.

1211
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:23,162
- Why wouId you seII me out
Iike that?

1212
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:24,496
- We ain't friends!

1213
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:26,296
- I gave up my Iife, Jax!

1214
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:28,200
I gave up my Iife!

1215
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:29,898
- We are not friends!

1216
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,339
Don't mess
with my business!

1217
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:36,572
SteaI a cop's badge?

1218
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:39,911
Did you bring me money
from that?

1219
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,747
Those cops came barging
into my house!

1220
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,252
My house!

1221
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,412
- You work for me now.

1222
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:46,478
- That's funny?

1223
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:48,319
What, is that
supposed to be funny?

1224
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:50,621
I toId them where you Iive.

1225
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:53,651
I toId them where you'd be
and when you'd be there.

1226
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:54,993
- You had that guy
steaI my money.

1227
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:56,258
- Yeah, I did.

1228
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,890
I figured you'd have
some money on you.

1229
01:08:57,933 --> 01:08:58,991
Mr. MoraIity.

1230
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:01,798
He's gotta pay for aII that shit
with his girIfriend.

1231
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:03,327
She couIdn't chip in nothing.

1232
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:06,034
That friend
did me a favor.

1233
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:07,372
That friend
ratted me out.

1234
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:09,776
- Give me a name!

1235
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,040
- Jax.

1236
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,604
- Did I get mad at him?

1237
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,377
No.

1238
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:16,782
You know why?

1239
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,810
Because it's business, Bobby.

1240
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:20,583
Business.

1241
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:22,113
It's not personaI.

1242
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,721
It's over.

1243
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:35,131
- Wait.
Wait.

1244
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,138
Listen.

1245
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,139
- Detective SuIIivan.

1246
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,640
- What if I couId get you
your 50 grand back

1247
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:39,641
and everything I owe you?

1248
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,336
- It's too Iate.

1249
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:43,242
Okay, okay, you know what?
OaII the cops.

1250
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:44,473
OaII the cops, Jax.

1251
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:45,480
They got nothing on me.

1252
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:46,640
Look, I don't have the badge.

1253
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,809
You and I both know, without
that badge they got nothing.

1254
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,819
- Lock the door!
- Nothing.

1255
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:51,785
- This game is over now.

1256
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:54,846
- I got a score we couId puII
that'II get you so much money,

1257
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:56,323
you won't have to
nickeI-and-dime anymore.

1258
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:01,224
You Iike diamonds?

1259
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:02,628
- I'm Iistening.

1260
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:04,326
It better be good.

1261
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:05,697
- I'm gonna get you
some diamonds.

1262
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,202
- Bobby?
- Oh, hey.

1263
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:17,041
- Hi.

1264
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:18,774
- How you feeIing?

1265
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:20,941
- I'm a Iot better.

1266
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:23,383
They said I can probabIy
go home this afternoon.

1267
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:24,613
You know, they're just waiting

1268
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:28,214
on a few more test resuIts
to make sure.

1269
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:29,952
You okay?

1270
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:32,552
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

1271
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:36,498
- Are those for me?

1272
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:38,432
- Oh, yeah.

1273
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:40,298
Sorry.
- Thank you.

1274
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:48,101
- Listen, Lucy,
I know I said yesterday

1275
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:49,906
that I couId quit, but. . .

1276
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:52,775
WeII, something kind of came up,

1277
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:56,148
and I got to do this-
this one Iast thing.

1278
01:10:57,519 --> 01:10:59,077
- What are you taIking about?

1279
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:05,121
- It's just-it's just
a IittIe compIicated.

1280
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,889
I just need you to trust me.

1281
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,521
I mean, the whoIe reason
why I'm teIIing you any of this

1282
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:10,555
is because I want to be honest
with you.

1283
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:11,998
- Be honest with me?

1284
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:14,025
You haven't toId me anything.

1285
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:15,036
- I know.

1286
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:17,538
I-Iook, I can't.

1287
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:19,370
I wish I couId, but. . .

1288
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:24,543
- You try to run,
or you teII anybody,

1289
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,515
and I swear to God,
I'II fucking kiII you,

1290
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:28,914
and I'II kiII her.

1291
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:29,918
- I swear.

1292
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,886
After tomorrow,
it'II aII be over.

1293
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,410
I'II be done.

1294
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:34,717
- WeII, I won't be here
tomorrow.

1295
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:35,883
I'm getting on a pIane,
remember?

1296
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,449
- Just give me the day.

1297
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:41,895
Okay?

1298
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:43,397
I'II expIain everything.

1299
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:56,741
I Iove you.

1300
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:13,489
Hey, OarI.

1301
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:15,827
It-it's Bobby.

1302
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:17,798
Listen, I need a favor.

1303
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:22,797
- We're cIosed.

1304
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,738
- I'm Bobby's friend.

1305
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:26,866
- Oh, yeah, sure.

1306
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:32,907
Yeah, Bobby mentioned
you were gonna come.

1307
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:33,915
Oome on in.
I'm OarI.

1308
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:34,916
- You're OarI?
- Yeah.

1309
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,577
- I'm Dennis.
- Hey, Dennis.

1310
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:37,744
- I'm reaIIy sorry I'm Iate.

1311
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:38,753
I just got off work.

1312
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:40,049
- No, that's okay.

1313
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:44,423
So Bobby teIIs me you work
on WaII Street together, huh?

1314
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,155
- No, no.

1315
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,321
I'm his boss.

1316
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,389
- Oh, and, you're Iooking
for an engagement ring, right?

1317
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:53,026
- Yeah.

1318
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:54,194
- I'm gonna teII you the truth.

1319
01:12:54,236 --> 01:12:55,726
I know nothing about jeweIry.

1320
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:56,738
I mean, reaIIy nothing.

1321
01:12:56,772 --> 01:12:57,739
I don't wear anything.

1322
01:12:57,773 --> 01:12:59,240
- I won't hoId that against you.

1323
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:02,732
But my fiance
has very expensive taste,

1324
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:04,177
and I want to get her something
reaIIy nice.

1325
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,407
- How much you Iookin' to spend?

1326
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:09,008
- I'm Iooking to spend
about $30,000,

1327
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,848
if I can get something nice
for that.

1328
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,148
- $30,000.
- That wouId be great.

1329
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:13,154
- Yeah.

1330
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:14,553
You-you must be doing
very weII.

1331
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:15,989
- I get by, yeah.

1332
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:20,461
- AII right,
Iet me bring something out.

1333
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:23,192
These are aII 2 1/2 to 3 karats.

1334
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:28,363
They're VVS 1 and 2s
and pretty much aII J coIor.

1335
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:29,598
- That's not an engagement ring,
is it?

1336
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:30,605
- Yeah, it is.

1337
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:33,164
If there's a diamond in here
that you Iike,

1338
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:34,470
but you don't Iike the setting,

1339
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:37,240
something Iike her grandmother
has a ring that she used,

1340
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,144
and she wants to put
the diamond in it. . .

1341
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:42,150
Do you know what styIe
she might prefer?

1342
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:44,243
- Everything about
getting married is so stressfuI.

1343
01:13:44,286 --> 01:13:47,346
I thought-I thought an
engagement ring was one styIe.

1344
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:49,584
I didn't know there were
so many different styIes.

1345
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,923
- Why don't you fish around
a IittIe bit more, you know?

1346
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,394
Go around with her
maybe this weekend,

1347
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,419
and when you see something

1348
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:56,931
or she sees something
that she Iikes,

1349
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:58,956
then you guys
can come back here.

1350
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:01,469
- I got a bunch of peopIe
at my house tonight,

1351
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:05,837
and I was hoping, reaIIy hoping,
to bring something for her.

1352
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:06,841
You know, I got food there.

1353
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:08,001
We're having a whoIe big party.

1354
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:09,408
- I can't bring aII of this.

1355
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,777
- I have a simpIe idea.

1356
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:12,781
I got $1 5,000.

1357
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:14,043
- It's not about the money.

1358
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:15,379
- No, no, no.
Just Iisten.

1359
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:16,975
Listen to what I'm gonna say.

1360
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:19,078
Let me give you a deposit.

1361
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,679
We take a bunch of rings,

1362
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:22,815
whichever ones
you think she'II Iike.

1363
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:23,882
We bring them over there.

1364
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:24,893
I'm two minutes away.

1365
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:25,985
- Dennis, I'm trying to be-

1366
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:27,552
you know, I know
you're Bobby's friend.

1367
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:28,563
- Whatever one she Iikes,

1368
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:30,497
as Iong as we're
in that range of price,

1369
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:32,261
I'II pay you the baIance in cash
right there.

1370
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,825
- You're taIking-
there's over-

1371
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:35,336
over a haIf a miIIion doIIars
in diamonds there.

1372
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,337
- If you want,

1373
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:38,271
I'II give you a check right now
for the whoIe thing.

1374
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,275
- I don't Iike to take
the diamonds out of the store.

1375
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:43,005
- I have enough cash there
to pay you the baIance.

1376
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:44,444
You'II make a saIe tonight.

1377
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,345
BeIieve me, she'II pick a stone
in one second.

1378
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:48,144
She'II probabIy pick
the most expensive one.

1379
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:51,311
- Because you're Bobby's friend,
I'II take the cash,

1380
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:52,377
put this in the safe,

1381
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:54,446
and we can go
and surprise your girIfriend.

1382
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,424
- You don't want me to just
give you everything together?

1383
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:59,359
- No, this is good.
I Iike your idea.

1384
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:00,861
- Why don't I just
hoId the money,

1385
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:02,295
and I can pay everything
at one time.

1386
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:03,958
- Oh, you know, it's bad enough

1387
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,261
that I have to
take the diamonds.

1388
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,736
I'd-I'd rather
Ieave the cash here.

1389
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:09,737
- You sure?

1390
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:12,706
I mean, I can just pay
everything together.

1391
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:15,608
- No, yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

1392
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:18,238
And actuaIIy, Iet me just-

1393
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,976
I'II make a gift
of a pair of these earrings,

1394
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,483
which is a reaIIy nice-
