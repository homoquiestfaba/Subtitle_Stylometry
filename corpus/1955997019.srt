gotta cover your face.

556
00:30:36,513 --> 00:30:38,935
You, you couldn't walk around like this.

557
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,415
No, no.

558
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:41,360
I couldn't walk around like this.

559
00:30:41,362 --> 00:30:42,508
I mean, look at me.

560
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,865
Now, the other question I have,

561
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:47,628
the prominent question is

562
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,048
do all your sexual proclivities include

563
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:53,108
the use of children's
games based on surgery?

564
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:57,049
Ah, what's a sexual,
what'd you say, sexual what?

565
00:30:57,051 --> 00:30:58,380
Proclivity.

566
00:30:58,382 --> 00:30:59,290
What is that?

567
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:00,648
Your needs.

568
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,848
Is that that thing that goes in the...

569
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,073
Your desires.

570
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:06,413
Okay, what did you say about kids?

571
00:31:06,415 --> 00:31:08,253
We're about to go to

572
00:31:08,255 --> 00:31:10,650
one more interview with
one of the cast members

573
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:12,676
of this historical dramatization.

574
00:31:12,678 --> 00:31:14,069
Would you like to introduce them?

575
00:31:14,071 --> 00:31:15,933
Yeah, I know this one really good.

576
00:31:15,935 --> 00:31:18,272
This person um, yeah,

577
00:31:18,274 --> 00:31:20,031
things were missing all around the set

578
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:21,070
after the shoot.

579
00:31:21,072 --> 00:31:21,903
Missing?

580
00:31:21,905 --> 00:31:23,265
Yeah, people's keys were
gone, jewelry was gone,

581
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:25,128
a lot of things were gone

582
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,883
and this person stole a lot of things

583
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,547
from a lot of people.

584
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:30,662
We had to make a full prostitution.

585
00:31:30,664 --> 00:31:32,630
Oh, goodness, well thank you for

586
00:31:32,632 --> 00:31:33,751
that introduction.

587
00:31:33,753 --> 00:31:34,584
Absolutely.

588
00:31:34,586 --> 00:31:36,090
Here's that interview
with that cast member.

589
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:37,943
(APPLAUSE)

590
00:31:37,945 --> 00:31:38,816
[REPORTER] Tittiana Sprinkles,

591
00:31:38,818 --> 00:31:42,653
the Pandora in both say
that you are difficult

592
00:31:42,655 --> 00:31:44,929
and that you spit on the
face and I just want to know,

593
00:31:44,931 --> 00:31:46,409
is this true and if so,

594
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:48,277
do you have message for them?

595
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:51,078
I think they better back themselves up

596
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,697
and check it 'cause
this right here, uh-uh,

597
00:31:54,699 --> 00:31:56,680
no, you just gotta get
outta the way of this,

598
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:59,675
it's not my fault that I need, you know,

599
00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:01,812
exactly eight inches of mirror

600
00:32:01,814 --> 00:32:03,878
but they only gave me seven.

601
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,435
[REPORTER] Do you say
they have body odors?

602
00:32:08,437 --> 00:32:11,020
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

603
00:32:12,072 --> 00:32:12,905
I mean,

604
00:32:14,297 --> 00:32:15,710
so,

605
00:32:15,712 --> 00:32:16,736
yes.

606
00:32:16,738 --> 00:32:19,917
[REPORTER] I want to watch the season

607
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,954
of the Dukes of Hazzard where the original

608
00:32:21,956 --> 00:32:24,956
stars do not play Bo and Luke

609
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:26,483
and it's probably not as good

610
00:32:26,485 --> 00:32:30,698
but I imagine this is, your
family is like Hee Haw?

611
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,978
My family?

612
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,845
Horrifying.

613
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:34,159
You can tell when it's someone...

614
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:37,577
We have loved having Earth
director Andrew Shearer

615
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:38,967
here with us today.

616
00:32:38,969 --> 00:32:40,407
You are just beautiful,

617
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:43,588
I want to lick your wrinkles,
they are so gorgeous.

618
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,370
Take a number, you know.

619
00:32:45,372 --> 00:32:48,325
Thank you so much
for have me on the show

620
00:32:48,327 --> 00:32:50,292
and having us talk to you, bye bye.

(ANDREW SHOUTS)

622
00:32:52,326 --> 00:32:53,729
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

623
00:32:53,731 --> 00:32:57,036
we have a huge treat for you today.

624
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:01,792
The one and only, descended
from the royal family

625
00:33:01,794 --> 00:33:05,635
of Iralane, the member of parliament,

626
00:33:05,637 --> 00:33:09,220
the illustrious, the
ancient, the gorgeous,

627
00:33:12,377 --> 00:33:16,525
Grand Muff Tit, Grand
Muff Tit, come, darling.

628
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:17,866
(APPLAUSE)

629
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:20,545
Oh, hello, thank you for having me.

630
00:33:20,547 --> 00:33:21,526
So good to see you.

631
00:33:21,528 --> 00:33:24,231
It's wonderful to see
you, Zee Zee, my dear.

632
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:25,392
You look so old.

633
00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:28,016
Oh, are you on AARP,

634
00:33:28,018 --> 00:33:30,756
which is a human, Earth word.

635
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,357
I heard of this, I know this thing too.

636
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:35,953
I feel like you could be on Medicare

637
00:33:35,955 --> 00:33:39,319
and no one would bat a lash, my darling.

638
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:40,959
Oh, you are too kind.

639
00:33:40,961 --> 00:33:43,023
You're too kind (LAUGHS).

640
00:33:43,025 --> 00:33:45,001
Now, Grand Muff Tit,

641
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:47,753
you are descended from the woman,

642
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,923
the pioneer who discovered that

643
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,523
we could trade the breast
nectar to the humans

644
00:33:57,525 --> 00:33:59,422
for the milk of the titty.

645
00:33:59,424 --> 00:34:03,798
It was your great, great,
great, great, great,

646
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,300
great grandmother?

647
00:34:07,765 --> 00:34:11,515
Yes, that's correct,
may she rest in peace.

648
00:34:13,623 --> 00:34:15,381
I didn't kill her, just in
case anyone was wondering.

649
00:34:15,383 --> 00:34:16,841
No, no, no, no.

650
00:34:16,843 --> 00:34:19,163
We will now see more interviews

651
00:34:19,165 --> 00:34:22,563
from this historical dramatization.

652
00:34:22,565 --> 00:34:25,182
Yes, they kicked me off the lot.

653
00:34:25,184 --> 00:34:27,023
They, they kicked you off the lot?

654
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:28,300
I don't wanna talk about it.

655
00:34:28,302 --> 00:34:29,600
It's a court thing.

656
00:34:29,602 --> 00:34:31,260
Oh, I see.

657
00:34:31,262 --> 00:34:33,343
Very well, let us go to these interviews.

658
00:34:33,345 --> 00:34:35,404
(APPLAUSE)

659
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,376
[REPORTER] Ms. Izzie Popp,

660
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:40,545
tell us, what is the meaning
of Space Boobs In Space

661
00:34:42,744 --> 00:34:46,139
for the artistic statement,
what you are making

662
00:34:46,141 --> 00:34:47,979
from this film?

663
00:34:47,981 --> 00:34:50,481
We have something to do with

664
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:56,541
I guess, interplanetary exploration.

665
00:34:56,543 --> 00:34:58,881
[REPORTER] So it is a
metaphor, what you are saying,

666
00:34:58,883 --> 00:35:02,966
from the outer space is
to speak from interspace.

667
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,597
That is correct.

668
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,077
[REPORTER] Could you
tell me a little bit

669
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:08,413
about your character,

670
00:35:08,415 --> 00:35:10,415
it appears as very smart

671
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:14,508
for what I would assume
is American astronaut?

672
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,431
That's right.

673
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:17,350
I am a ship captain and

674
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:20,933
I am skeptical at first.

675
00:35:22,856 --> 00:35:26,577
It's fascinating to think of what it

676
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:29,172
would be like in the
future when we do finally

677
00:35:29,174 --> 00:35:30,841
discover alien life.

678
00:35:33,237 --> 00:35:35,975
[REPORTER] I think this
is why I will consider you

679
00:35:35,977 --> 00:35:40,335
a worthy thing for the
science fiction genre.

680
00:35:40,337 --> 00:35:41,373
Oh definitely.

681
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:43,400
[REPORTER] Mostly they
are transforming or they are

682
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:45,757
Captain America and they are not...

683
00:35:45,759 --> 00:35:48,642
I think they will be breaking ground

684
00:35:48,644 --> 00:35:50,144
with this film and

685
00:35:52,481 --> 00:35:55,712
all audiences, whether they're American

686
00:35:55,714 --> 00:35:58,915
or international will greatly appreciate

687
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:00,500
how realistic and...

688
00:36:02,437 --> 00:36:04,835
[REPORTER] Pandora Disaster?

689
00:36:04,837 --> 00:36:06,096
Yes?

690
00:36:06,098 --> 00:36:07,403
[REPORTER] I would like to know,

691
00:36:07,405 --> 00:36:10,283
first, how is it like to work with the

692
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:14,006
behavior problems of Coquette Du Jour

693
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:15,538
and of Izzie Popp?

694
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,032
They like sitting around on the floors

695
00:36:18,034 --> 00:36:21,337
and do this bump and grind thing,

696
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:23,422
I don't quite understand.

697
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,250
In my country,

698
00:36:27,684 --> 00:36:29,267
it's no acceptable.

699
00:36:30,703 --> 00:36:32,500
You would be beheaded.

700
00:36:32,502 --> 00:36:34,041
[REPORTER] Space Boobs From Space,

701
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:37,045
why are they talk about the breasts

702
00:36:37,047 --> 00:36:39,760
and do you think the America
is ready for the boob?

703
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:43,280
I think the American needs to understand

704
00:36:43,282 --> 00:36:46,615
that boobs, the tits, are glorious, yes.

705
00:36:49,104 --> 00:36:51,465
They are multi-functional and they are

706
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:53,598
very pleasing to the eye.

707
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,880
[REPORTER] Do you think
that the violence is too much

708
00:36:56,882 --> 00:37:00,004
in the America, do you
think there is not enough

709
00:37:00,006 --> 00:37:03,701
of the bare exposed anus
and things like this

710
00:37:03,703 --> 00:37:06,669
instead of the bullet and the gun?

711
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:09,254
I think the American needs to

712
00:37:10,426 --> 00:37:12,343
expand their mind, yes.

713
00:37:13,747 --> 00:37:17,802
They need to grow up,
stop that stupid nonsense,

714
00:37:17,804 --> 00:37:20,147
their ridiculous politics.

715
00:37:20,149 --> 00:37:23,982
They needs to understand
that art comes first.

Now, Grand Muff Tit,

723
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:29,316
I must know, I must ask you,

724
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:32,479
why were you not included in the film?

725
00:39:32,481 --> 00:39:35,689
What happened, tell us everything.

726
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:37,685
Well, you see,

727
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:39,810
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

728
00:39:39,812 --> 00:39:42,010
I know, but you must, we're dying.

729
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:45,762
I feel like you and
I are such close, close

730

731
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,349
Oh!

732
00:39:51,351 --> 00:39:53,991

here earlier before me?

00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:06,825
Andrew Shearer, yes.

737
00:40:06,827 --> 00:40:08,994
That nefarious director,

738
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:13,656
yes, Andrew Shearer.

739
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:17,484
Yes, yes, what did he do,

740
00:40:17,486 --> 00:40:20,149
what did he do, tell us Grand Muff Tit,

741
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,430
my breasts are heaving with emotion.

742
00:40:22,432 --> 00:40:24,810
Oh, speaking of heaving breasts,

743
00:40:24,812 --> 00:40:27,395
that is where the story begins.

744
00:40:30,288 --> 00:40:31,205
Imagine it,

745
00:40:32,132 --> 00:40:34,049
a closed Paramount lot,

746
00:40:35,673 --> 00:40:39,090
heaving breasts as far as the eye can see

747
00:40:40,049 --> 00:40:42,799
and me with my wizened, yet still

748
00:40:46,854 --> 00:40:50,854
appreciated by traditional
Earth custom titties,

749
00:40:52,293 --> 00:40:56,136
in the audience, waiting to meet that

750
00:40:56,138 --> 00:40:57,721
nefarious director.

751
00:40:59,527 --> 00:41:03,194
Our eyes locked from
across the crowded lot.

752
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:07,341
I approached him.

753
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:11,355
I was very afraid, you see.

754
00:41:11,357 --> 00:41:13,855
You see, I hadn't had any of that

755
00:41:13,857 --> 00:41:16,690
delicious breast milk yet that day

756
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:21,893
and I said, no, I don't
need that courage right now,

757
00:41:21,895 --> 00:41:22,728
I see him.

758
00:41:26,258 --> 00:41:29,675
We started a passionate, passionate tryst

759
00:41:30,658 --> 00:41:33,658
and by tryst I mean planning murders

760
00:41:34,861 --> 00:41:36,778
while eating Triscuits.

761
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:40,832
But then, in the manner of all men,

762
00:41:45,954 --> 00:41:50,121
he left me for a Wheat Thin (CRIES).

763
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,283
Oh, oh.

764
00:41:53,264 --> 00:41:55,126
I was irate, naturally,
as you can imagine.

765
00:41:55,128 --> 00:41:56,763
Of course, of course.

766
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:57,919
What did you do?

767
00:41:57,921 --> 00:42:00,841
Oh, I went back to the
lot the very next day

768
00:42:00,843 --> 00:42:04,176
and I said, where is that Andrew Shearer

769
00:42:05,043 --> 00:42:07,421
and they said, we don't know
what you're talking about,

770
00:42:07,423 --> 00:42:08,704
please leave.

771
00:42:08,706 --> 00:42:11,200
Well, I burned down the whole studio

772
00:42:11,202 --> 00:42:14,004
and it wasn't until later I realized

773
00:42:14,006 --> 00:42:17,313
I burnt down the Fox lot
and not the Paramount lot.

774
00:42:17,315 --> 00:42:18,146
That's a common mistake, yes.

775
00:42:18,148 --> 00:42:19,171
Yes, it was very sad.

776
00:42:19,173 --> 00:42:20,350
Common mistake, yes.

777
00:42:20,352 --> 00:42:23,710
So, I was no longer allowed
to be a part of that movie.

778
00:42:23,712 --> 00:42:24,790
Oh.

I am loving this exotic outfit,

831
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:10,689
can you tell us about it?

832

Oh, this.

833
00:49:12,589 --> 00:49:13,748
Yes.

834
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:17,069
When I was doing research for my

835
00:49:17,071 --> 00:49:21,238
highly critically acclaimed
turn in Space Boobs In Space,

836
00:49:25,386 --> 00:49:29,491
I did research on that period
of time in Earth history.

837
00:49:29,493 --> 00:49:31,065
The 1990s, yes.

838
00:49:31,067 --> 00:49:32,150
Reagan years.

839
00:49:33,321 --> 00:49:36,742
And I learned that Earth humans,

840
00:49:36,744 --> 00:49:40,911
they would wear dead animals
draped across their bodies,

841
00:49:42,984 --> 00:49:44,158
it was very popular.

842
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,246
Oh, goodness,

843
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:46,605
well, did you kill this thing?

844
00:49:46,607 --> 00:49:49,024
No, I didn't kill this one.

845
00:49:50,026 --> 00:49:51,943
This is a vintage piece

846
00:49:52,806 --> 00:49:55,701
but the humans, they raise the animals,

847
00:49:55,703 --> 00:49:58,621
it was a special breeding program

848
00:49:58,623 --> 00:50:02,963
and they were raised to
have depression issues

849
00:50:02,965 --> 00:50:05,546
and they would kill themselves.

850
00:50:05,548 --> 00:50:07,556
Oh, I love all of this, it's beautiful.

00:50:07,558 --> 00:50:09,023

852
00:50:09,025 --> 00:50:13,261

to watch some human films,

853
00:50:13,263 --> 00:50:16,465
some human sort of
documentary educational films

854
00:50:16,467 --> 00:50:17,563
that humans make...

855
00:50:17,565 --> 00:50:18,396
About nature?

856
00:50:18,398 --> 00:50:20,695
Yes, yes, for other
humans to learn about

857
00:50:20,697 --> 00:50:21,858
the place where they live.

858
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,558
I find Earth nature,
just, it's fascinating.

859
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,939
We should really,

860
00:50:25,941 --> 00:50:28,797
I mean, the same planet that produced

861
00:50:28,799 --> 00:50:30,457
the milk from the titty.

862
00:50:30,459 --> 00:50:32,098
Oh, milk from the titty.

863
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,839
We really, we owe it to ourselves to

864
00:50:33,841 --> 00:50:38,698
learn as much as possible
about their natural habitat.

865
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,434
Yes, habitat.

866
00:50:40,436 --> 00:50:41,678
Let's go to the film.

00:50:42,716 --> 00:50:44,540
Hi, I'm Andrew and I
make really cheap movies.

869
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:47,617
I am very interested in
the idea of real monsters

870
00:50:47,619 --> 00:50:49,759
because then I don't have to come up

871
00:50:49,761 --> 00:50:51,721
with the makeup for it.

872
00:50:51,723 --> 00:50:53,857
They've already got it on
'cause they're monsters.

873
00:50:53,859 --> 00:50:56,299
My only problem really is that,

874
00:50:56,301 --> 00:50:57,781
will they kill me

875
00:50:57,783 --> 00:51:00,620
and all I've heard about
the Sandy Creek Mud Monster

876
00:51:00,622 --> 00:51:02,705
is that she kills people.

877
00:51:05,643 --> 00:51:07,017
I kind of need

878
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:11,186
to know if there's a female
swamp monster around here,

879
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:14,720
'cause if there is,

880
00:51:14,722 --> 00:51:18,018
I don't want somebody
else filming her first.

881
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,675
I should be the one to do it.

882
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:22,580
I mean, that makes total sense.

883
00:51:22,582 --> 00:51:24,249
So, I'm on my way to

884
00:51:25,613 --> 00:51:27,578
the Sandy Creek Nature Center

885
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:30,798
and I'm gonna go way off the beaten path,

886
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,157
gonna go really far,

887
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:35,078
back to the parts where

888
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,400
it's a little dicey and no one ever goes

889
00:51:37,402 --> 00:51:40,460
because if she's gonna be living somewhere

890
00:51:40,462 --> 00:51:44,629
and everybody with their
phones and all that stuff,

891
00:51:45,901 --> 00:51:47,820
and never gotten a picture of her,

892
00:51:47,822 --> 00:51:50,258
there's gotta be a reason for it.

893
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,279
It's gotta be a place where

894
00:51:52,281 --> 00:51:55,785
it's not safe to bring
your beard and you PBR,

895
00:51:55,787 --> 00:51:57,381

916
00:52:56,832 --> 00:52:59,291
that kind of thing but so far, so good.

917
00:52:59,293 --> 00:53:01,863
Basically, everything that you see here

918
00:53:01,865 --> 00:53:04,282
is couture, I made it myself.

919
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,163
Everything that you see me wearing,

920
00:53:07,165 --> 00:53:09,073
I found here in the woods.

921
00:53:09,075 --> 00:53:10,669
It's actually three bags,

922
00:53:10,671 --> 00:53:13,338
is that I braided and used some,

923
00:53:14,387 --> 00:53:17,071
you know, another campers shoelaces.

924
00:53:17,073 --> 00:53:18,320
[ANDREW] So are those
people still alive or

925
00:53:18,322 --> 00:53:19,853
how's that working?

926
00:53:19,855 --> 00:53:22,767
Um, I mean, define alive.

927
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:24,793
[ANDREW] Now they're included
in fashion, which is way

928
00:53:24,795 --> 00:53:26,453
more important than
just a mortal existence.

929
00:53:26,455 --> 00:53:27,527
Fashion is forever.

930
00:53:27,529 --> 00:53:28,552
[ANDREW] Certainly.

931
00:53:28,554 --> 00:53:29,634
Fashion is forever.

932
00:53:29,636 --> 00:53:31,719
So, uh, I was camping and

933
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:36,356
you wouldn't know it now, but
I was a bit of a princess,

934
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:37,275
wasn't into

935
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:43,827
being in the woods, I was a bit
of a, you know, city owl and

936
00:53:48,096 --> 00:53:51,670
well, I was out there camping and you see,

937
00:53:51,672 --> 00:53:55,954
I heard a sound and I
went to investigate and

938
00:53:55,956 --> 00:53:59,623
I saw the mud monster
and I was attacked but

939
00:54:01,337 --> 00:54:02,254
not killed.

940
00:54:03,214 --> 00:54:05,399
So, uh, he kind of retired.

941
00:54:05,401 --> 00:54:07,071
He just left the woods.

942
00:54:07,073 --> 00:54:08,516
He went to Reno.

943
00:54:08,518 --> 00:54:11,436
Since I was already, you know, afflicted,

944
00:54:11,438 --> 00:54:13,658
I decided to go with it.

945
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,898
I like being in the woods, you know and

946
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:20,817
sometimes I think the
call of Broadway might be

947
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:24,857
somewhere in my future but

948
00:54:24,859 --> 00:54:26,836
you never know, you know?

949
00:54:26,838 --> 00:54:28,334
Mud monster one day.

950
00:54:28,336 --> 00:54:29,338
[ANDREW] Yeah, stranger
things have happened.

951
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,933
Yeah, the internet.

952
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:32,880
[ANDREW] Is this where you live?

953
00:54:32,882 --> 00:54:35,498
This is my place, this
is where I keep my things.

954
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,837
You know, all my wearable art.

955
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:38,945
[ANDREW] That's nice,
where'd you get that,

956
00:54:38,947 --> 00:54:39,778
do you remember?

957
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,545
I think it was a sorority group.

958
00:54:41,547 --> 00:54:43,205
They ran so fast, I didn't get the chance

959
00:54:43,207 --> 00:54:44,585
to find out, I guess.

960
00:54:44,587 --> 00:54:46,003
[ANDREW] I remember
them, 'cause it was like,

961
00:54:46,005 --> 00:54:47,925
they had trouble
identifying them as missing

962
00:54:47,927 --> 00:54:49,724
because they all looked the same.

963
00:54:49,726 --> 00:54:51,547
I mean, it doesn't
get any finer than this,

964
00:54:51,549 --> 00:54:52,604
I mean, what's luxury?

965
00:54:52,606 --> 00:54:53,437
[ANDREW] Exactly.

966
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,351
Sleeping under the stars.

967
00:54:54,353 --> 00:54:55,750
[ANDREW] Yeah, yeah,
well, where do people go

968
00:54:55,752 --> 00:54:57,787
when they wanna get away, anyway?

969
00:54:57,789 --> 00:54:58,846
You're already there.

970
00:54:58,848 --> 00:55:01,598
That's right, I'm already here,

971
00:55:02,491 --> 00:55:03,324

00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:24,670
and maybe we'll see you around.

979
00:55:24,672 --> 00:55:26,766

Oh, goodness, that's very educational.

985
00:55:48,754 --> 00:55:50,047
Nature, Earth nature,

986
00:55:50,049 --> 00:55:52,855
I didn't know monsters
were even real there

987
00:55:52,857 --> 00:55:54,062
and I believe that...

988
00:55:54,064 --> 00:55:55,362
Like the Yeti.

989
00:55:55,364 --> 00:55:57,481
Like the Yeti, which I
believe lives in the ocean,

990
00:55:57,483 --> 00:55:58,430
isn't that correct?

991
00:55:58,432 --> 00:55:59,263
Yes.

992
00:55:59,265 --> 00:56:00,096
Yes?

993
00:56:00,098 --> 00:56:00,929
Yes.

994
00:56:00,931 --> 00:56:02,830
I did a lot of research on human culture

995
00:56:02,832 --> 00:56:06,474
and Earth history and I
found some interesting things

996
00:56:06,476 --> 00:56:09,976
about them, like it is a little known fact

997
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:15,050
that humans are obsessed
with their own anus.

998
00:56:16,551 --> 00:56:17,770
Their anus?

999
00:56:17,772 --> 00:56:19,390
Yes.

1000
00:56:19,392 --> 00:56:21,729
They, at that point in history,

1001
00:56:21,731 --> 00:56:25,793
they took all these
photographs of their buttocks

1002
00:56:25,795 --> 00:56:29,065
which is where the human anus is located.

1003
00:56:29,067 --> 00:56:32,556
The anus is in their buttocks?

1004
00:56:32,558 --> 00:56:34,094
How do they sit on the chairs?

1005
00:56:34,096 --> 00:56:35,301
I know.

1006
00:56:35,303 --> 00:56:37,501
Oh, Shearer was sitting
there with his anus,

1007
00:56:37,503 --> 00:56:38,726
you realize this?

1008
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,155
Yes.

1009
00:56:40,157 --> 00:56:42,016
Oh, horrifying, horrifying.

1010
00:56:42,018 --> 00:56:42,849
It's very distasteful.

1011
00:56:42,851 --> 00:56:44,580
It's very distasteful.

1012
00:56:44,582 --> 00:56:47,358
We're better not thinking about it.

1013
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,462
So humans, at this point in history

1014
00:56:49,464 --> 00:56:53,682
were obsessed with their
own anus and knowing that

1015
00:56:53,684 --> 00:56:55,934
gave me an understanding of

1016
00:56:56,883 --> 00:56:59,818
how the Queen would have felt

1017
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:03,634
interacting with these primitive humans

1018
00:57:03,636 --> 00:57:06,886
who were so stupid and so obsessed with

1019
00:57:08,145 --> 00:57:10,499
their own defecation.

1020
00:57:10,501 --> 00:57:13,013
Have you had any sort of

1021
00:57:13,015 --> 00:57:16,438
strange interactions with the illustrious

1022
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,499
Grand Muff Tit,

1023
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:23,276
who was descended from the
Queen you have portrayed?

1024
00:57:23,278 --> 00:57:25,778
I really feel very fortunate

1025
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:29,866
that Grand Muff and I have always had,

1026
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:35,258
I feel a cordial relationship, really.

1027
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,432
Ah.

1028
00:57:36,434 --> 00:57:38,517
Considering everything.

1029
00:57:39,463 --> 00:57:42,463
The keyed car, the burned studios.

1030
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,239
I mean, I have a long history

1031
00:57:46,241 --> 00:57:48,120
of reliability on set.

1032
00:57:48,122 --> 00:57:48,955
Ah, yes.

1033
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,253
I never try to

1034
00:57:53,283 --> 00:57:56,439
show my Triscuits to the director.

1035
00:57:56,441 --> 00:57:58,540
So, you are a lady, you are.

1036
00:57:58,542 --> 00:58:02,482
You know, I feel that things
should be kept professional,

1037
00:58:02,484 --> 00:58:03,901
you know, I just,

1038
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:07,538
and I think that's served me well but

1039
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:10,274
everybody has their
own approach, you know.

1040
00:58:10,276 --> 00:58:11,920
That's very true.

1041
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:15,246
I don't bring matches to set.

1042
00:58:15,248 --> 00:58:18,282
I think that has been instrumental

1043
00:58:18,284 --> 00:58:21,540
in the furthering of my career.

1044
00:58:21,542 --> 00:58:24,766
Well, it's been wonderful
for you to enlighten us all

1045
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:27,622
into your film career and your friendship

1046

Now we are going to go to some interviews

1049
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,605
with your cast members from the film.

1050
00:58:38,607 --> 00:58:39,541
Oh, good.

1051
00:58:39,543 --> 00:58:40,374
Enjoy.

1052
00:58:40,376 --> 00:58:41,990

1053
00:58:41,992 --> 00:58:43,493
[REPORTER] Diego Wolf, thank you

00:58:45,097 --> 00:58:46,854
I just wanted to know if you could tell us

1056
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:51,010
why you are participated
in the movie about breasts

1057
00:58:51,012 --> 00:58:53,750
when you could be possibly,
maybe, a political statement

1058
00:58:53,752 --> 00:58:57,085
or a social statement or save the whale,

1059
00:58:57,972 --> 00:58:59,613
why you are doing the movie instead?

1060
00:58:59,615 --> 00:59:02,428
Why can't I save the whale
and play with the boobs?

1061
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:05,871
[REPORTER] Do you know what

I don't know.

1079
00:59:57,326 --> 00:59:58,608

1080
00:59:58,610 --> 00:59:59,938

[REPORTER] How do you
feel about the baby cow and

1095
01:00:30,562 --> 01:00:33,147
how the milk is only for him and not

1096
01:00:33,149 --> 01:00:35,405
for the human consumptions?

1097
01:00:35,407 --> 01:00:38,592
You know, I never really
thought it before but

1098
01:00:38,594 --> 01:00:40,368
it's kind of fucked up, eh?

Steve Irwin per personal

1100

and how do you feel he, Paul Hogan

1101
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,727
was affected by his untimely passings?

1102
01:00:50,204 --> 01:00:52,565
What is your favorite color?

1103

1105
01:00:58,316 --> 01:01:01,654
have murdered Coquette Du
Jour in the dressing room.

1106
01:01:01,656 --> 01:01:03,471
Have you heard about,
can you confirm these

1107
01:01:03,473 --> 01:01:04,390
for Brazil?

1108
01:01:05,894 --> 01:01:08,492

Ladies and gentlemen, I am Zee Zee Poof

1111
01:01:11,847 --> 01:01:16,407
and we are here with the
late actress Beryl Peep.

1112
01:01:16,409 --> 01:01:18,949
Now Mrs. Peep, we have
just seen some of your

1113
01:01:18,951 --> 01:01:21,607
illustrious cast mates
talking about the film.

1114
01:01:21,609 --> 01:01:23,745
It was a joy to work with, really,

1115
01:01:23,747 --> 01:01:25,265
almost all of them.

1116
01:01:25,267 --> 01:01:26,098
I can tell.

1117
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,150
Now we are going to go
straight to the next film

1118
01:01:28,152 --> 01:01:30,267
because it is one of my personal favorites

1119
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:32,963
in which you play a dead human,

1120
01:01:32,965 --> 01:01:35,209
which is just fascinating.

1121
01:01:35,211 --> 01:01:37,450
It was a lot of work, you know.

1122
01:01:37,452 --> 01:01:40,589
The extensive prosthetic make-up

1123
01:01:40,591 --> 01:01:42,169
that had to be put on me.

1124
01:01:42,171 --> 01:01:43,353
Oh.

1125
01:01:43,355 --> 01:01:44,765
Really took a long time,

1126
01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:47,311
they had to cover my age spots,

1127
01:01:47,313 --> 01:01:48,671
which was very uncomfortable.

1128
01:01:48,673 --> 01:01:50,354
I don't know that I could do that.

1129
01:01:50,356 --> 01:01:53,094
It felt odd to be so ugly, you know,

1130
01:01:53,096 --> 01:01:55,091
and to look so human.

1131
01:01:55,093 --> 01:01:56,911
They're so strange looking.

1132
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:58,370
They're very ugly.

1133
01:01:58,372 --> 01:02:00,774
What sort of method
did you have to go into

1134
01:02:00,776 --> 01:02:02,150
to play a dead human,

1135
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:05,250
did you think about your
anus the entire time?

1136
01:02:05,252 --> 01:02:07,531
Well, I talked to the other
humans because, you know,

1137
01:02:07,533 --> 01:02:10,411
some of the roles were
played by actual humans.

1138
01:02:10,413 --> 01:02:12,059
Yes, had they been dead before?

1139
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:15,014
I talked to the other humans on set

1140
01:02:15,016 --> 01:02:18,009
and they told me that the dead humans

1141
01:02:18,011 --> 01:02:20,564
don't utilize their anus.

1142
01:02:20,566 --> 01:02:21,688
At all?

1143
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:22,521
No.

1144
01:02:22,523 --> 01:02:23,354
How bizarre.

1145
01:02:23,356 --> 01:02:25,475
So they just stop when they die

1146
01:02:25,477 --> 01:02:26,792
and they just, odd.

1147
01:02:26,794 --> 01:02:30,995
So it was very strange because I had to

1148
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:34,497
both be this human character who remembers

1149
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:38,006
being obsessed with my own anus.

1150
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,568
So coming up next.

1151
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:42,814
Yes, this film that I play in.

1152
01:02:42,816 --> 01:02:43,894
Can you give us a little bit

1153
01:02:43,896 --> 01:02:45,353
of an introduction?

1154
01:02:45,355 --> 01:02:49,699
(SIGHS) Well, I felt like this was a,

1155
01:02:49,701 --> 01:02:52,284
a deeply emotional role for me,

1156
01:02:53,137 --> 01:02:56,421

Can they go back and forth?

1161
01:03:07,865 --> 01:03:09,204
Can dead humans come back?

1162
01:03:09,206 --> 01:03:11,478
No, they just stay that way.

1163
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,540
They're very strange.

1164
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:14,862
That's so weird.

1165
01:03:14,864 --> 01:03:15,695

1182

a movie, it was really sweet,

wasn't cheesy or anything

for me and my research,

was something of a turning point

all parts of human life

them being called freckles,

have these weird little

In order to alleviate
those unsightly wrinkles,

1540
01:27:52,203 --> 01:27:54,286
what I might suggest is

1541
01:27:54,288 --> 01:27:57,538
laying back and letting your saggy skin

1542
01:27:59,181 --> 01:28:03,596
just kind of, let gravity
just kind of take it's,

1543
01:28:03,598 --> 01:28:06,598
take it's hold and then
if you could get your skin

1544
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:10,760
in the very back and just
pull it as taut as possible.

1545
01:28:10,762 --> 01:28:13,657
I wouldn't say a staple gun

1546
01:28:13,659 --> 01:28:15,758
but if that's what you have on hand,

1547
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:20,518
don't let me stop you and
just go (IMITATES STAPLE GUN),

01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:23,920

that loose skin in place.

you call them, scarves,

1550
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:33,820

in some pleasing fashion,

1551
01:28:35,543 --> 01:28:37,675
perhaps like this, with my hair,

1552
01:28:37,677 --> 01:28:39,941
but you don't have hair like this, I do,

1553
01:28:39,943 --> 01:28:43,375
so you would have to find a scarf

1554
01:28:43,377 --> 01:28:47,127

two, personal greetings,

followed by an Iralanian goodbye (LAUGHS)

01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:38,535

1564
01:29:38,537 --> 01:29:41,559
move your hands up to your titty

1565
01:29:41,561 --> 01:29:45,989
forming titty fins, then
in an alternating motion,

1566
01:29:45,991 --> 01:29:50,418
move your hands up,
down, up, down, up, down,

1567
01:29:50,420 --> 01:29:54,251
then lock eye contact
with the other Iralanian,

1568
01:29:54,253 --> 01:29:57,111
up, down, up, down, move into position,

1569
01:29:57,113 --> 01:29:59,154
up, down, up, down,

1570
01:29:59,156 --> 01:30:01,575
approach the other Iralanian,

1571
01:30:01,577 --> 01:30:04,827
up, down, up, down, make titty contact,

up, down, up, down, now
shimmy, up, down, up, down,

1573
01:30:10,557 --> 01:30:12,640
up, down, and then break.

1574
01:30:13,814 --> 01:30:14,731

1575
01:30:15,596 --> 01:30:19,248
Now, onto the official state-sanctioned

Iralanian goodbye

1577
01:30:23,855 --> 01:30:26,583
and for that, we will move our hands

1578
01:30:26,585 --> 01:30:29,002
back up to titty fin position

1579
01:30:29,957 --> 01:30:34,124
and then quickly move them
to our buttocks, like so

1580
01:30:36,973 --> 01:30:39,349
and this is mimicking our

1581
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:42,518

1585

1588

the three proper dessert spoons

1589
01:31:09,734 --> 01:31:13,708
because if you don't have
three, what's the point?

1590
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:17,742
You have to use one, um, nom, nom, nom,

1591
01:31:17,744 --> 01:31:20,077
two, um, nom, nom, nom, nom,

1592
01:31:21,575 --> 01:31:25,910
and three and you have
to hold them this way,

1593
01:31:25,912 --> 01:31:28,493
slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp,
slurp, it's delicious.

1594
01:31:28,495 --> 01:31:30,914
If you were to mix all of the traditional

1595
01:31:30,916 --> 01:31:33,583
Iralanian desserts on one spoon,

1596
01:31:34,457 --> 01:31:38,428
when combined with the
oxygen and the metal alloys

1597
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:42,513
in the spoon, you would
die a very painful death,

1598
01:31:46,154 --> 01:31:49,571
very slowly over the course of 20 minutes

1599
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:55,256
to 15 years, there's just no telling.

1600

1601
01:31:57,973 --> 01:31:59,312
but I must bring her back again.

01:32:12,258 --> 01:32:13,818
Okay, goodbye.

1606
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:16,153
Some lovely Earth titty milk

1607
01:32:19,376 --> 01:32:21,916
and it will always be served

1608
01:32:21,918 --> 01:32:24,935
in a glass like this and we will always

1609
01:32:24,937 --> 01:32:27,187
take a sip of it like this.

1610
01:32:30,414 --> 01:32:34,581
It's wonderful what our two
cultures can do when combined.

1611
01:32:36,518 --> 01:32:39,974
We will remain looking fresh till death

1612
01:32:39,976 --> 01:32:43,893
and you, when consuming
our lovely titty nectar

1613
01:32:46,578 --> 01:32:50,517
will avoid the certain
death that all of us

1614
01:32:50,519 --> 01:32:53,686
must receive by one more pleasant day,

1615
01:32:55,274 --> 01:32:58,915
unless you eat all the
desserts on one spoon,

1616
01:32:58,917 --> 01:33:02,058
then your death will last
anywhere from 20 minutes

1617
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:03,227
to five years.

1618
01:33:04,858 --> 01:33:09,025
Yes, we Iralanians will
drink your human titty milk

1619
01:33:11,017 --> 01:33:13,615
because we need it to survive.

1620
01:33:13,617 --> 01:33:17,173
If we don't, we'll turn back into squids

1621
01:33:17,175 --> 01:33:21,342
and if I turn back into a
blessed squid one more time

1622
01:33:23,399 --> 01:33:26,259
because of a trade embargo,

1623
01:33:26,261 --> 01:33:30,675
I will go Cthulhu on all
of your major cities,

1624
01:33:30,677 --> 01:33:33,260
towns and tourist destinations,

1625
01:33:34,533 --> 01:33:36,668
specifically Panama City Beach,

1626
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:41,654
you know what you did,
PCB, you know what you did.

1627
01:33:41,656 --> 01:33:44,736
If I may call my lovely
production assistant Boob

1628
01:33:44,738 --> 01:33:47,988
here to reclaim this container from me,

1629
01:33:49,154 --> 01:33:52,487
there's only so much of human titty milk

1630
01:33:53,970 --> 01:33:56,955
I can take in one day,
despite being delicious

1631
01:33:56,957 --> 01:34:00,051
and we do thank you for your trade.

1632
01:34:00,053 --> 01:34:01,994
We do, I hate being a squid.

1633
01:34:01,996 --> 01:34:03,794
It's just the worst.

1634
01:34:03,796 --> 01:34:05,713
Alright, goodbye, Boob.

1635
01:34:07,296 --> 01:34:11,572
(LAUGHS) And thank you
so much for joining us

1636
01:34:11,574 --> 01:34:14,991
on this Earth Public Broadcasting System.

1637
01:34:16,178 --> 01:34:20,211
Remember, they need your
donations to help us

1638
01:34:20,213 --> 01:34:22,434
make this happen (LAUGHS).

1639
01:34:22,436 --> 01:34:23,792
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

1640
01:34:23,794 --> 01:34:25,812
Oh, and who could that be?

1641
01:34:25,814 --> 01:34:28,390
Why, it's my boyfriend,

1642
01:34:28,392 --> 01:34:32,559
Tom Cruise, Jr., Jr., Jr.,
Jr., the second (GIGGLES).

1643
01:34:37,854 --> 01:34:40,354
He's human, I'm so progressive

1644
01:34:42,532 --> 01:34:44,932
and remember, the next time you're invited

1645
01:34:44,934 --> 01:34:48,601
to an Iralanian state
function of some sort,

1646
01:34:50,828 --> 01:34:54,129
I have taught you all the
basics you need to know

1647
01:34:54,131 --> 01:34:57,464
to not look like the wrong kind of boob.

1648
01:34:58,589 --> 01:34:59,422
Come.

1649
01:35:00,307 --> 01:35:03,890
(FUTURISTIC AMBIENT MUSIC)
