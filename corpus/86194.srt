1
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,935
<i>Hi. </i>

2
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,363
<i>Hi. </i>

3
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,567
<i>How are you doing? </i>

4
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:45,143
<i>Fine. </i>

5
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:49,438
<i>I'm sorry I didn't</i>
<i>show up yesterday. </i>

6
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,552
<i>It's okay. </i>
<i>I missed you. </i>

7
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:04,586
<i>But what for</i>

8
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,998
<i>What for so much sky</i>

9
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,780
<i>What for so much sea</i>

10
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,611
<i>What for</i>

11
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:33,287
<i>What good is the wave that breaks</i>

12
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:38,523
<i>In the morning breeze</i>

13
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:46,136
<i>What good is the morning</i>

14
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:51,166
<i>Useless landscape</i>

15
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,600
Forget it, Pedro Paulo.
It's over.

16
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,609
- Things don't end this suddenly.
- Yes, they do.

17
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,235
No, they don't.

18
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,008
Look, I don't know if things
end this way or not...

19
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,050
but what we had together is over.

20
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,415
We'll go on Saturday, then.
For one night.

21
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,613
You can choose a romantic inn.

22
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,349
Pedro Paulo, my darling.

23
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:14,654
Former spouses don't travel
together to romantic inns.

24
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,821
Technically speaking,
we're not former spouses yet.

25
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:21,423
Technically speaking,
I wouldn't travel with you...

26
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,593
if my life depended on it.

27
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,263
MasterJockstrap
won't let you go?

28
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,942
If you break
into my apartment again...

29
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,408
- Our apartment.
- My apartment.

30
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,570
And you're forbidden
to go in when I'm not there.

31
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,372
Does theJapanese guy
look sexy in his jockstrap?

32
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,746
He's notJapanese.
He's Chinese.

33
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,716
These Orientals are perverted.

34
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,015
Has he asked you
to perform any strange acts yet?

35
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,181
There are no "strange acts"
for people with open minds.

36
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:51,127
Don't let him tie you up in bed.
These guys will steal your furniture.

37
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,291
What do you mean "these guys"?
Have you gone mad?

38
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,532
Japanese always travel in groups.

39
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,633
Give me back the key.

40
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,507
Come on.

41
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,002
I'm sorry.

42
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,295
- I was swimming.
- No problem.

43
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,873
Good morning, Miss Simpson.

44
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:17,744
- How are you doing this morning?
- Fantastic.

45
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,291
In English, please, Nadine.

46
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,723
You're not going
to ask me about Gary?

47
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,422
Yes. Your Internet romance.
How's it going?

48
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,863
- Yesterday he said he loves me.
- What?

49
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,395
Really?

50
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,869
He signed off,
" Love, Gary."

51
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,168
Nadine, you mustn't read
too much into that.

52
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,304
Americans use the word
"love" very casually.

53
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:51,542
We say "I love you"
like you say "Good-bye."

54
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,183
" Hi. You must be Gary.

55
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,087
I'm Nadine.

56
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,855
I came all the way
from Brazil to see you only."

57
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,589
Just to see you.

58
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,563
- Okay. Just to see you.
- Right.

59
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,659
"I know that I don't
know you very much."

60
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,795
- Very well.
- Thank you.

61
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,066
No. I don't know you very well.

62
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,508
- " But you don't know me either."
- Ei-ther.

63
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:24,874
" But I am sure,
deep inside my heart...

64
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,214
that you are
the person of my life."

65
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,914
You know, you don't say
"person of my life."

66
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,047
You'd say "man of my life."

67
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,922
I think "soul mate"
is more romantic.

68
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,801
Good morning.

69
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,099
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

70
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,972
Vermont Associates.

71
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,882
I'm sorry.

72
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,920
Who are you?

73
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,084
Your new law intern.

74
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,425
It must be some mistake.
I don't have an intern, old or new.

75
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,496
Is this Mr. Pedro Paulo's office?

76
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,367
That's me, but at the moment
I need no intern.

77
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:20,099
New Resolution #5, 7 83/99
requires that...

78
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:27,375
five percent of the payroll
of law firms be made up of interns.

79
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,448
Yes.

80
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,245
So you're my five percent.

81
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,946
I ranked third among
the 23 candidates for this job.

82
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,715
Your first assignment:

83
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:44,024
Take these papers
to Mr. Juan Alvarado, my father...

84
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,189
and return with them signed.

85
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,666
Copacabana,
534 Duvivier, suite 902.

86
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,602
I'm not a messenger.
I'm a law intern.

87
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,240
For your information,
my father is a client.

88
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,800
I'm defending him
in a lawsuit in divorce court.

89
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,113
Aren't you going
to write down the address?

90
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:12,146
534 Duvivier, suite 902.

91
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,429
"Alvarado Custom Tailors
Refined Clothing Since 1 938"

92
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,040
Senor Juan, please.

93
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,750
- Who would like?
- Who would like what?

94
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:13,876
Senor Juan.

95
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,679
I would like Senor Juan.

96
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,019
Who would like
to speak to Senor Juan?

97
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,060
I have some papers
for him to sign.

98
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:25,528
He's with a client.
You can leave them with me.

99
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:29,931
Sorry, but I have instructions to bring
these papers back with me, signed.

100
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,102
You can wait, then.

101
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,538
- I don't need the Internet.
- You think you don't need it.

102
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:12,099
- I don't need one of those, either.
- Soon you'll say you don't need man.

103
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,907
Well, for the last two years.

104
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,346
Two years?
No man?

105
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,147
- Or the Internet.
- The best place to find a man.

106
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,414
What ever happened
to dinner and a movie?

107
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:27,856
A guy who spends his nights in front
of a computer has to be a good date.

108
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,191
He's not married, and he doesn't
sleep with a lot of girls.

109
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,265
Maybe there's a reason
he's not married.

110
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,857
Maybe there's a reason
he doesn't sleep with a lot of girls.

111
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,060
Maybe...

112
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,796
he's not even a man.

113
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,034
How do you say...?

114
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,339
- Don't knock it till you've tried it.
- Yeah, that's it.

115
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,574
Tonight come by my house
and we'll go into a chat room together.

116
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,618
- I don't think so.
- Tonight. Promise.

117
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,687
- We'll see.
- Okay.

118
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,290
I'm sorry.
I thought it was a robbery.

119
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,328
Nadine, I'm sure
you recognize Acacio...

120
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,023
and this is Gordo, his manager.

121
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,800
Gordo is more than my agent.
He's my buddy.

122
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,734
In English, please.

123
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,635
- Sorry.
- Hi. How's it going?

124
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,571
Acacio's going to play
in England.

125
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,473
I know. I saw it on TV.

126
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,807
Speculation.
Nothing's signed yet.

127
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,905
- Twelve million is cheap.
- You're crazy!

128
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,747
Acacio was the top goal scorer
in the last two Rio championships.

129
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,311
If I were him,
I'd only sign for 1 5.

130
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,025
Acacio was the top goal scorer
in the last two Rio championships.

131
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:38,722
She's right.
Twelve million is too little.

132
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,856
Acacio is a great player.

133
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,665
Thanks, but I don't need
anyone to defend me.

134
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,602
You watch and see
if he's not the best.

135
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,937
Senor Juan.

136
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:53,940
That's me.

137
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,942
Can we talk for a moment?

138
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,018
Of course, Mr. Vermont.

139
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,087
Have you finished
the American contract?

140
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,257
Not yet.
It's almost ready.

141
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:09,559
You know, Americans
are sticklers for details.

142
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,887
I come from three generations
of tailors.

143
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,933
- Details are my specialty.
- I know.

144
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,137
It's just that you...

145
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,975
This piece of junk
is really badly designed. Sorry.

146
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,009
You seem tired lately.

147
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,847
As a lover of justice,
you should understand...

148
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,646
that I'm going through
a difficult moment.

149
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,779
- Recent separation...
- Four months is not so recent.

150
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,720
Right, it's not...

151
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,126
but then there's my father's case
against his latest wife.

152
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,197
The judge is going
to rule this week.

153
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,765
Juan. How is he?

154
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,235
He's all right...

155
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,794
but I want him to stay away
from all the dirt in the case.

156
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,807
Welcome to England, Acacio.
Are you going to miss Brazil?

157
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,399
Yes, I am.

158
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,105
And what do you think
you're going to miss most?

159
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,113
Especially you.

160
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:08,512
What have you got to say
to your new fans in Manchester?

161
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,688
Hello, Manchester people.
I love you.

162
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:17,518
Sorry to interrupt, but this
is the fourth class that I've been at.

163
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,293
Your grammar is perfect,
but I disagree with the subject.

164
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,765
Really?

165
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,359
Gordo wants
to change the program.

166
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,904
Wants.

167
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:34,045
Adapt the curriculum
to Acacio's basic needs in England.

168
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,114
And these basic needs are?

169
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,045
Trash talk.

170
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,209
Yeah. The bad is good, teacher.

171
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,220
The English play
an Anglo-Saxon-style soccer.

172
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,586
He won't last five minutes
on the field...

173
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,626
unless he can tell his opponent
what to do with the ball.

174
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:52,254
And what, exactly, do you want to tell
your opponent to do with the ball?

175
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,502
To put in their ass.
Inside of their ass.

176
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,369
At least up his mother's ass.

177
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:06,133
"Shit" is <i>merda</i>
in English, right?

178
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,303
Right.

179
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,976
Go to shit.

180
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,285
- No, that doesn't really work.
- No?

181
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,484
Don't you have
anything with "ass"?

182
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,526
You can "kiss it."

183
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,363
Kiss it my ass.

184
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,659
Better. What does it mean?

185
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,331
Oh, shit.

186
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,531
I don't know. Acacio asking
an English player to kiss his behind?

187
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,131
Trust me. No one's
going to think it's an endearment.

188
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,711
How would you say
<i>casa do caralho</i> in English?

189
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,712
I know.
I look in the dictionary.

190
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,783
It's "home of the dick."
Right?

191
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,512
You need something
with "fuck" in the middle.

192
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,555
How do they say it?
" Motherfucking."

193
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:51,748
No, "motherfucker."

194
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,718
In American films
it's "modafucka"!

195
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,896
Who's the teacher here?
Him or me?

196
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,074
Sorry.

197
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,134
Fat, wait for me in the car.

198
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,328
The good old ear test.

199
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,522
How are you doing, son?

200
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,893
My fingers, my eyes
can deceive me...

201
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,866
but never my ears.

202
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,835
The fabrics speak to me.

203
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,970
I can't hear a thing.

204
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:47,637
I know. That's why I didn't insist
that you follow in my footsteps.

205
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,715
The fabrics tell you what type
of clothes they want to be.

206
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,187
You'll never forgive me for
not being able to listen to the fabrics.

207
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,159
Who am I to forgive anyone?

208
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,626
I don't defend universal truths.

209
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,530
I defend my own truths...

210
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,470
but look where it's gotten me.

211
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,335
It's made you
an extremely elegant old man.

212
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,375
What good is elegance...

213
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,377
in these days
of jeans and T-shirt?

214
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:27,215
Women don't look
for elegance anymore.

215
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,378
They only look for money.

216
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:33,549
Four wives... my mother in the '50s,
yours in the '60s...

217
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,059
another one in the '7 0s...

218
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,186
and he ended up in trouble
with this one in the '90s.

219
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,600
If Veronica ends up
with this shop...

220
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,101
This place is my life.

221
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,503
- We're going to win, right?
- Yes.

222
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,670
What do you want?

223
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,746
No rush.
It's just that...

224
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,015
High quality.

225
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,325
It would make a nice suit
if it weren't for the color.

226
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,156
But Dad, my idea was to make
a Campari-colored suit.

227
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:13,356
If the cloth cries out to be a suit,
it can make a nice suit...

228
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,365
even if it was born Campari.

229
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,245
Excuse me.

230
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,131
May I help you?

231
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,109
In English, please.

232
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,577
The lady that went in the elevator...
Is that a student?

233
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:38,650
No.

234
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,213
I think that I know her family...

235
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,312
No, no. She's a teacher.

236
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,032
Hi, sweetheart!

237
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,778
<i>Ready for cyberspace? </i>

238
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,111
I just got in
a very exclusive chat room.

239
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,152
A friend has just arrived.

240
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,614
She's an Internet virgin.

241
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,878
You do this every night?

242
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,240
No.

243
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,439
On Thursdays
I eat at my mother's...

244
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,449
then I come home
and take a Valium.

245
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,350
Wouldn't you rather
meet someone live?

246
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,389
In a real place?

247
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,254
Like at the beach?

248
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,052
And compete with those teenagers
who live at the gym?

249
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,097
No. Thank you.

250
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,858
By any chance...

251
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,698
do you meet live people
in real places?

252
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,500
No...

253
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,341
but I don't want
to meet anyone.

254
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,876
Everyone wants to meet someone.

255
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,708
I already met the person
I was supposed to meet...

256
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,611
and I married him.

257
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,213
Are you divorced?

258
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,048
No. Widowed.

259
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,622
I'm sorry.

260
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,258
No, Nadine.

261
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,987
It's not like I'm some
traumatized madwoman.

262
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,722
Okay, but I am.

263
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,860
Must be Gary.

264
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,777
" Love is a virus...

265
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:49,711
that infiltrates itself...

266
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,477
in the system of two lovers.

267
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,847
Yours, Gary"

268
00:20:55,821 --> 00:21:00,155
He didn't sign off"love,"
but there are two "loves" before.

269
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,394
It's good, no?

270
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,418
Remember me?

271
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,921
Of course.
My public defender.

272
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,923
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- What?

273
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,638
Far out.

274
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,244
Can I try it?

275
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,553
Far out.

276
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,672
<i>I need to tell you</i>
<i>that I love you</i>

277
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,938
<i>I could win or lose you</i>

278
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,140
<i>But I need to tell you</i>
<i>that I love you</i>

279
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,543
Beautiful.

280
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:46,931
You have mine.

281
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,124
I have yours.

282
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,261
Miami I can get you
for $7 50.

283
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,431
It has to be New York.
Can I just buy a one-way ticket?

284
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,340
There's a flight with stopover
in Paraguay for $650.

285
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:02,936
$650... It's still a little high.
No, thanks.

286
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,109
You can't get a hotel in New York
for less than $7 0 a day.

287
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,517
I'm staying with my boyfriend.

288
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:13,182
- He has a loft in Soho.
- Can't he lend you some money?

289
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:17,090
No, he doesn't know me yet.

290
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,189
Your boyfriend doesn't know you?

291
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,298
No. What I mean is,
not in person.

292
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:28,231
I see. He's just heard about you.

293
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,104
We have an Internet romance.

294
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,234
The Internet. Really?

295
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,542
It'll be six months in April.

296
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:40,709
You're my second client
who's found someone on the Internet.

297
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,879
There was a girl from Goias State,
not bad-looking...

298
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,924
rather provincial, who married
a French computer professor.

299
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,822
Gary is a visual artist.

300
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,589
An artist makes
a lot of money in the US.

301
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,994
Americans respect artists.

302
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,067
Yesterday he told me
that he loved me.

303
00:23:56,701 --> 00:24:00,000
I get goose bumps
talking about these things.

304
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,498
6'2", waist-length hair.

305
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,575
Any tattoos?

306
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,337
He only mentioned one:

307
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,608
a huge tribal symbol on his back.

308
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,110
You're going to meet this Gary.

309
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:16,346
I'm going to give you a discount
I wouldn't give my own mother.

310
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,649
Fifteen percent.

311
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,451
Thank you.

312
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:22,959
" Marjorie and Jo-Jo
live and work in New York City.

313
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,354
They have been married
for one year.

314
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:31,130
- They have a big dog called Rex."
- Settle, people.

315
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:34,672
"They live in a very big apartment
on Fifth Avenue."

316
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,172
Fifth.

317
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,113
Shut up!

318
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,946
Shut up, guys.

319
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,149
She said, "Shut up!"

320
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,324
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

321
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,554
Welcome.

322
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,218
Thank you.

323
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,666
- <i>Son of a "beetch. "</i>
- Son of a bitch!

324
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,805
- Good!
- What's the difference?

325
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:30,039
Bitch is a female dog.
Beach is the sand by the ocean.

326
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,275
- English, please.
- Asshole.

327
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,477
- Fuck you, slut!
- Up yours, dickhead!

328
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:36,178
- Eat my shorts.
- Blow me!

329
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:37,720
- Motherfucker!
- Cocksucker!

330
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,312
Shit, that's very sexy.

331
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,228
For that...

332
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,233
the referee
will give you a red card.

333
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,805
It's a big soccer game tonight.

334
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,883
The national team is playing.

335
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,611
It's on the TV.

336
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,648
- Is Acacio playing?
- I'm sure.

337
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:16,191
Well, let's get started, then.

338
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:20,025
Why don't you open
to page 3 5 and read?

339
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,390
Do you prefer
on the top or below?

340
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,332
I beg your pardon?

341
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,998
The reading.
I should read on the top?

342
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,176
You mean,
should you stand up?

343
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,172
I'm sorry. Yes.

344
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,706
- Stand up. Do you prefer?
- No, you're fine.

345
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:46,550
" Marjorie and Jo-Jo
love romantic evenings...

346
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:50,321
and romance in New York City
always starts on Broadway."

347
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,728
" Marjorie and Jo-Jo
love romantic evenings."

348
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,965
Sorry.

349
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,436
"They enjoy fine restaurants."

350
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,113
<i>I've been searching for a fabric</i>
<i>the color of this bay... </i>

351
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,845
<i>for some time now. </i>

352
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,520
I'm serious. I love this color...
dirty green.

353
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,558
You're putting me on.

354
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,457
Wow!

355
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:08,559
Your eyes are the color
of this bay!

356
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,427
Man, you're weird.

357
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,666
They are! Look at me.

358
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,439
Look at me.

359
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,602
Let me check.

360
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:27,348
Incredible.
Exactly the same color.

361
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,945
You're the first person
that says they're green.

362
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,887
But they are...
dirty green.

363
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,756
I think so too, but everyone else
thinks they're brown.

364
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:38,818
No.

365
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:30,980
That guy who works
with your father...

366
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,073
- Which one?
- The one from Niteroi.

367
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:34,310
Roberto.

368
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,850
He's not gay, is he?

369
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,355
No.
Not as far as I know.

370
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,125
Why?

371
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:45,286
I don't know.
He's just weird.

372
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,353
He's my brother.

373
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,203
Don't worry.
He's just a half brother.

374
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,470
Then I just
half embarrassed myself.

375
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,768
Mr. Pedro Paulo's office.

376
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:02,643
It's Sharon.

377
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,445
Sharon, the intern.

378
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,509
Hello, who is this?

379
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,518
Since when do you have
an intern?

380
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:11,820
Jealous?

381
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,892
Me? Jealous?
Are you mad?

382
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,828
I'll be right with you.
Take a seat.

383
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,624
I just called to check something.

384
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,566
I'm filling out a questionnaire
in a magazine.

385
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,570
Did you ever make number two
in front of me?

386
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:29,801
What?

387
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:34,004
Number two.
You know, in the bathroom.

388
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:34,908
Poop?

389
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,038
No, of course not.

390
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,706
<i>I knew it. </i>

391
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:42,877
Thanks for clearing that up.
Good-bye.

392
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,448
Seven years of marriage...

393
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:50,152
and we never made number two
in front of one another.

394
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,626
Really?

395
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,755
Seven years and not once.

396
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,629
Cool.

397
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,827
And how about you and Gary?

398
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,770
What? Poop?

399
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,999
No, silly, your virtual romance.

400
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,541
Enough virtual.
No more talk.

401
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,008
Cock.

402
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:13,416
How long does it take
to get a visa?

403
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:17,648
" New York City is the financial
capital of the world."

404
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:20,223
World. Roll your "r."

405
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,029
" Downtown, on Wall Street...

406
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,189
is the World Trade Center...

407
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:32,100
and the Staten Island ferry."

408
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,363
Staten.

409
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,210
- Miss Simpson?
- Yes?

410
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,938
- Who's it from?
- I just make the deliveries.

411
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,380
Thank you.

412
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,885
"On Wall Street
is the Stock Exchange."

413
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,818
Let's start from the beginning.

414
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,884
" New York City is the financial
capital of the world."

415
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,292
Good.

416
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,701
" Downtown, on Wall Street,
is the World Trade Center...

417
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:09,103
and the Staten Island ferry."

418
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:16,306
So, what's the growth rate?

419
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,882
About five percent per year.

420
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,850
They say that
after a certain age...

421
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,944
your belly becomes
your wealth index.

422
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:28,551
That explains
why I'm always broke.

423
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,161
Everything went well downstairs.

424
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,767
And the girl?
Is she pretty?

425
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,428
Very pretty.

426
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,407
- Good night.
- Bye, Mrs. Simpson.

427
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,948
- Very good.
- Thank you.

428
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,229
Here we are.
Let's get in.

429
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,493
- Are you coming?
- No, it's full.

430
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,161
- We'll squeeze in.
- You count for two.

431
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,041
- Hi.
- Hi.

432
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:28,976
- Beautiful blouse.
- Thank you. It was a present.

433
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,423
Your boyfriend has good taste.

434
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,151
No, I don't have a boyfriend.

435
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,228
I'm guessing
it was from a pupil.

436
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,297
- What?
- Pupil<i>. Aluno. </i>

437
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,059
Someone from our class?

438
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:49,135
No, he's a private student.

439
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:55,945
Dr. Vermont.

440
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,513
What are you doing here?
Learning English again?

441
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:10,524
I would like to introduce you
to my girlfriend, Mary Ann.

442
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,858
She teaches English here.

443
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,599
It's a pleasure.

444
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:26,439
Ricardo was a pilot.
I was a stewardess.

445
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,637
That's how you met?
Flying together?

446
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,246
No. We worked
for different airlines.

447
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,215
I met him at a party.

448
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,549
A month later
we were married.

449
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,484
Love at first sight.

450
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,115
It happens.

451
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,085
It just happened to me.

452
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,534
How did he die?
Plane crash?

453
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,508
No. He drowned.
The current was very strong that day.

454
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,074
It's a funny thing.

455
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:05,979
I used to be afraid of the ocean.
I never learned to swim.

456
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,412
Now I swim every day
and I'm afraid to fly.

457
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,188
Crazy, huh?

458
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,751
- Waiter, another <i>caipirinha</i>, please.
- Right away.

459
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,426
I'm scared to drive.

460
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,056
You're kidding.

461
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,101
No. Never learned.

462
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,965
Never wanted to.

463
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,602
My wife said that's because
I am without ambition.

464
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,972
That I have no direction
in my life.

465
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,136
If it's any consolation...

466
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:38,010
I think ambition
is highly overrated.

467
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,730
Are you all right?

468
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:01,035
Just can't drink like I used to.

469
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:09,740
I like the sand.
It makes me feel grounded.

470
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,245
- I have a confession.
- What?

471
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,323
I have to make you
a confession.

472
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:22,256
- What?
- The blouse.

473
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,225
I sent it to you.

474
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:27,991
You?

475
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,528
It's the first women's clothes
I made in my life.

476
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,501
I'm not sure I finished it right.

477
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:37,733
Wait, wait.
You made the blouse?

478
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:41,811
My father has a tailor shop.

479
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:44,506
I didn't pick up the scissors
for 20 years.

480
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,947
You made this blouse for me?

481
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,620
Really?

482
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,351
I'm an attorney.

483
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,517
Attorneys don't lie.

484
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,798
Not outside the courtroom.

485
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,812
You're okay?

486
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,892
Great.

487
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,658
Is Mary Ann in?

488
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:10,751
Yes.

489
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:18,899
I'm her student and I dropped by
to clear up a question.

490
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,403
- A question?
- Yes. An English question.

491
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:26,033
You know, those questions
that keep you up all night?

492
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:27,474
No.

493
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:31,577
Well, I woke up with this question
pounding in my head...

494
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,513
and decided to drop by.

495
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:37,279
She's inside looking
for the grammar book.

496
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,955
Did you found
the grammar book?

497
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,067
Are you an old student of hers?

498
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,609
No. I just started this week.

499
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:04,537
Cute, isn't she?

500
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:08,247
Who, her?
I didn't really notice.

501
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:11,411
She has a marvelous little ass.

502
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:14,682
A beautiful ass.

503
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,630
Don't tell anyone...

504
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:23,564
but some really crazy shit
has gone down between us.

505
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:26,933
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

506
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,931
Always at the end of class.

507
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,667
I see.

508
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,671
What type of
"really crazy shit"?

509
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,943
The first time,
I was about to leave.

510
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,514
She came up from behind me...

511
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,820
<i>and took me to school</i>
<i>with her tongue. </i>

512
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:03,338
<i>The second time, I told her</i>
<i>about this knee injury. </i>

513
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:10,006
That night,
against Argentina...

514
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:12,978
Three to one.
You scored a hat trick.

515
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:20,482
Miraculous tongue.
Better than Ben-Gay.

516
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,155
Did you found
the grammar book?

517
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,899
Teacher, let's go.

518
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,266
Fuck.

519
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,397
- Fuck your mother.
- Fuck your mother's mother.

520
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,805
Kiss my dick!

521
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:41,036
Absolutely not.

522
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:44,945
I told Gordo an apartment
with an ocean view.

523
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:46,879
Yes.

524
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:49,509
Is there at least
a lake or a lagoon?

525
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:53,751
All right, then something
with a river view.

526
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,156
I need to speak to you.

527
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,428
About last night...

528
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,589
Did something happen
between him and you?

529
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,257
Okay.

530
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,428
How am I supposed to know
London's not on the ocean?

531
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:11,264
- How do they say that?
- I'll explain tomorrow.

532
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,366
No, no, tomorrow
I talk to English people.

533
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,472
The next day, then.

534
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:26,221
Speaking of meetings,
I just remembered.

535
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,223
May I use your telephone?

536
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:33,893
My client has the final say,
or the deal is off.

537
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,397
Okay. I'll see you in court, then.
Good-bye.

538
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,392
Lawyer?

539
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:44,738
- Do you do contracts?
- It's my specialty.

540
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:56,752
- See you.
- Who's the suit?

541
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,721
Another student of hers.
Good people.

542
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,229
He's gonna take a look
at the contract.

543
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,658
Lawyers, lawyers.

544
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:27,245
- Hi, Pecanha!
- Hi, miss!

545
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,512
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

546
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:22,099
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome aboard Mary Ann Airlines.

547
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,572
Destination: Heartbreak City.

548
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,166
Fasten your seat belts, folks.

549
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:30,337
It's going to be
a long and lonely ride.

550
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:33,280
Pilot's dead,
crew's out to lunch...

551
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:35,578
but, hey,
have a nice flight.

552
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:41,285
Son of a bitch.

553
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,120
You left me.

554
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:45,286
Why can't I leave you?

555
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,479
<i>Calm down. Concentrate. </i>
<i>Use the Silva Method. </i>

556
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,354
- <i>The what? </i>
- <i>The Silva Method of Mind Control. </i>

557
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,189
Silva's Mind Control.

558
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:20,889
You place your three fingers like this
and then concentrate.

559
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,398
Is that by that Chinese guy?

560
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,661
The Silva Method.
Haven't you ever heard of it?

561
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:28,670
- No.
- Everyone knows the Silva Method.

562
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:30,899
Everyone but me.

563
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:32,999
The little blue book,
<i>The Silva Method. </i>

564
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,010
It was the rage
back in the '80s.

565
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,706
I've never heard about
the fucking method, all right?

566
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:44,485
I'm sorry, Tania.
It's just that...

567
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:50,786
I heard they give freelancers
a hard time.

568
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,385
Relax. You don't look poor.

569
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:55,260
Just stay cool.

570
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,091
I'm gonna say...

571
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:02,296
that I'm a very
sought-after professional.

572
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:06,433
And that you would never work
as a waitress in a foreign country.

573
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:09,171
Only use that
if he gives you a hard time.

574
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,915
What if they ask
how many dollars I have?

575
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:18,317
Lie. Tell them $3,000.

576
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:21,084
What if they want
to see the $3,000?

577
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:22,249
Me?

578
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:28,525
Hi. How are you?

579
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,936
What is the purpose
of your trip?

580
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,231
Do I need a purpose?

581
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:38,103
I didn't know
that I needed a purpose.

582
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,505
- Purpose?
- Where are you staying?

583
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:44,773
In Gary's loft.

584
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:46,678
Who is Gary?

585
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:50,310
- My boyfriend.
- Is Gary an American citizen?

586
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:54,186
Yes. I believe he is.
I don't know.

587
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:56,122
I'm not sure.

588
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,796
What is Gary's address?

589
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,634
W-W-W dot...

590
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,572
Excuse me, honey.

591
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,041
I'm her travel adviser.

592
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:16,510
Is Sylvia,
the Consul's secretary, in?

593
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:19,309
We belong to the same gym.

594
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:22,010
May I have a word with her?

595
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:54,348
You eat too fast.
It's bad for your health.

596
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,697
Hello?

597
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:11,097
You won't believe this.
I just got an E-mail from Gary!

598
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:13,931
- <i>He's coming to Rio! </i>
- When?

599
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:17,973
Tomorrow! He wants my phone number
so he can call me when he arrives.

600
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,906
<i>Did he say what time? </i>

601
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,604
Nothing. No arrival time,
no flight number.

602
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:26,204
<i>It says he's coming</i>
<i>for 'professional reasons. "</i>

603
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:29,080
<i>But he signed it, "Love, Gary. "</i>

604
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:33,680
Well, if it says " Love, Gary," then...
Can I call you right back?

605
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:48,795
<i>Tania, are you okay? </i>

606
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:50,668
Do you want to spend
this weekend with me?

607
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:56,111
I do. But tomorrow I have
to pick up a gringo at the airport.

608
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:58,477
You don't want to travel
with me anymore.

609
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,982
That's not it. It's just...

610
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,681
And theJapanese guy?

611
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,351
What? Soup. What soup?

612
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,624
Wait a minute.

613
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:13,926
"3:00 p.m. at the offices of'...

614
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:17,488
I'll call you later. The judge is going
to render a decision in Juan's case.

615
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:21,697
- Should I notify your father?
- No. I'll talk to him later.

616
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:30,272
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

617
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,381
Is Juan with a client?

618
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,007
Yes.

619
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,380
Sharon?

620
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:03,545
Did the judge rule
in favor of Veronica?

621
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:09,050
I told him I wasn't an expert
in these types of cases.

622
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:14,855
Okay, I'll see you next week.

623
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:04,574
"Never give all the heart...

624
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:08,872
for love will hardly seem
worth thinking of...

625
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:12,642
to passionate women,
if it seem certain...

626
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:16,879
and they never dream
that it fades out from kiss to kiss.

627
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:22,214
For everything that's lovely
is but a brief, dreamy, kind delight.

628
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,395
<i>O never give the heart outright... </i>

629
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:30,930
for they, for all
smooth lips can say...

630
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:33,730
have given their hearts
up to the play.

631
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:39,838
And who could play it well enough
if deaf and dumb and blind with love?

632
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:44,506
He who made this
knows all the cost...

633
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:48,776
for he gave
all his heart and lost."

634
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,174
In English, please.

635
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,243
Is my class finished already?

636
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:17,973
Your class finished early this evening.
The teacher wasn't feeling well.

637
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:33,560
- Miss Simpson is not home yet.
- Are you sure?

638
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,427
She went to the English course.
She'll be back later.

639
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,194
I know, but...

640
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,695
Thanks.

641
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,515
- Mr. Collins?
- Yes.

642
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:33,055
- Trevor Collins?
- Yes. I said yes. Do you speak English?

643
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,885
Yes. My name is Pedro Paulo.

644
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:37,721
Yes. You speak English.
And what is your name?

645
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:41,763
- Pedro Paulo. Peter Paul.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Trevor.

646
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,894
- It's my laptop.
- That one, maybe?

647
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:48,903
No, no. It's okay.
I can handle it.

648
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,037
- First time in Brazil?
- Yeah.

649
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:56,476
I've been to Colombia
and Venezuela before, but never Brazil.

650
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,604
Brazil is not like
Colombia and Venezuela.

651
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:00,683
They speak Spanish.
We speak Portuguese.

652
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:03,446
They invented mambo.
We, bossa nova.

653
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,526
- Hi.
- Miss Simpson isn't back yet.

654
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:13,789
- Did she go swimming?
- Yes.

655
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:20,753
Dad?

656
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,268
"With his feet in London,
but his head in Rio"

657
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:28,030
Hello, my friend.

658
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,899
Isn't this Pedro Paulo's office?

659
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,641
Yes.

660
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,637
Gordo, wait.

661
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:40,648
He told me to drop by
so he could look at my contract.

662
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,880
He'll be back soon.
He's picking up a gringo at the airport.

663
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:47,445
We can't wait.
We have a very important meeting.

664
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:49,548
1 1:30 a.m. with the English
at the Sheraton.

665
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:53,693
It's all here.

666
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:01,369
These papers are too much.

667
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:03,871
- Too much.
- Too much.

668
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:08,842
I think your first mistake was
to agree to meet at their hotel.

669
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:10,572
It's the enemy's territory.

670
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,615
An important meeting like this
should be held in a neutral place.

671
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,715
It should be at a steak house.

672
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:18,652
Not bad!

673
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:23,192
Then you could stuff the English
with sausages and <i>caipirinhas... </i>

674
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:27,627
then get them to sign a clause
of transitory irrevocability.

675
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,721
- Please, have a seat.
- Thanks.

676
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:34,360
That would mean one million dollars
more by the end of the contract.

677
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,533
Do you speak English?

678
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:42,509
Does the rain in Spain
stay mainly in the plain?

679
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,739
<i>I'm not usually this stressed, </i>
<i>you know? </i>

680
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,186
It's okay.
I'm a little bit stressed too.

681
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:56,551
Sorry about the air conditioning.

682
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:00,930
Cookies, cookies.

683
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,430
Take two, pay for one.

684
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:06,329
Thanks.

685
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,056
It's good.

686
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:30,853
I'm supposed to meet someone
here in Rio.

687
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,087
A girl.

688
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:35,130
- Brazilian girlfriend?
- No.

689
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:37,199
Not a girlfriend yet.

690
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:41,930
Just an incredibly hot
cyberspace pen pal.

691
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:45,502
- Is she pretty?
- She was the "Girl From Ipanema."

692
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:47,509
Excuse me?

693
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:51,979
She said she won the "Girl From Ipanema"
contest five years ago.

694
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:57,143
- Then she's very beautiful.
- Really?

695
01:00:57,253 --> 01:01:00,484
- Not that I care about that.
- You should care.

696
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,821
<i>Garotas de Ipanema</i>
are very exceptional.

697
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,221
Well, Internet lovers.

698
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:10,231
You know,
people can say anything.

699
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:14,368
I told her I was a Soho artist
and my name is Gary.

700
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,606
Why did you say that?

701
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:21,973
So I could attract the kind of women
that Soho artists attract.

702
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:23,443
Wild.

703
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:25,207
Outrageous.

704
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:26,906
Erotic.

705
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,314
Hip, cool chicks, you know?

706
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:30,386
I know.

707
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:33,748
Corporate law isn't exactly
a babe magnet.

708
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,658
That's true.

709
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:40,562
Do you think
she'll be disappointed?

710
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:43,356
No.

711
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,431
This clause is a trap.
Let's cut it.

712
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:54,738
This one can stay, as long as they pay
in case of annulment.

713
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:59,643
Sharon, something happened.

714
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:02,843
Roberto, call me in 20 minutes.
I'm with a client. Bye.

715
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:11,787
This clause makes no sense.
Only in their fucking dreams.

716
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,759
Are you an attorney?

717
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:16,828
No, Gordo.
She's a manicurist.

718
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:18,298
Keep going.

719
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,064
This is a recording.

720
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:24,765
The number you have reached
has been disconnected.

721
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:34,741
Oh, my God!
Is she gonna be okay?

722
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,689
Take a look at it.

723
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:58,371
" Unless one of the parties stipulates
a clause to the contrary."

724
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:00,574
I dig.

725
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,317
Is it my impression...

726
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:21,396
or are you rubbing
up against me?

727
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:24,963
It's your impression.

728
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:28,366
I'll see you tomorrow.

729
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:29,836
Please show him out.

730
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:35,735
Excuse me,
but who are you?

731
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:37,176
Gordo.

732
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,181
I can see that,
but why are you standing there?

733
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,341
Private meeting.

734
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:48,419
- Hi, Vermont.
- Tania, what a surprise!

735
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:50,219
Everything okay?

736
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:54,788
- Who's that man?
- He's Acacio's bodyguard.

737
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:58,292
- Is Pedro Paulo in?
- I think so.

738
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:06,569
Pedro Paulo, it's me, Tania!

739
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,042
I need to speak with you.

740
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:14,375
- Call the police!
- I'm gonna go in.

741
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:16,814
- Let me in.
- I'm calling the police.

742
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:20,818
I can't believe this.

743
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:23,187
This is incredible.

744
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:26,352
I got a cramp in my leg,
and I couldn't swim.

745
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:29,727
- It's all right. Relax.
- I wanna go home.

746
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:34,360
The doctor wants you to stay
an extra hour for observation.

747
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:37,735
- You want me to call someone?
- No, there's no one.

748
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:42,671
Nadine, what would I have done
without you?

749
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:48,076
You look so beautiful.

750
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:52,182
I have good news.

751
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:53,414
What?

752
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:57,091
Gary's coming to Rio.

753
01:04:57,193 --> 01:05:00,390
All the things people say about Brazil...
the violence and such...

754
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:03,158
they exaggerate,
because Brazil is also friendly...

755
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:06,235
- You have to let us in!
- This is absurd! It's my firm!

756
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:11,430
Dr. Trevor, welcome.
How was your flight?

757
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,371
Very good.

758
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:17,378
- What's going on here?
- Pedro Paulo is in a private meeting.

759
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,573
- I'm Pedro Paulo.
- Remember that.

760
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:27,651
- Isn't he Acacio, the soccer player?
- Hi. What's up?

761
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,725
Were you fooling around
in my office?

762
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:31,816
- I was here with your partner.
- What partner?

763
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:32,917
Sharon.

764
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:35,827
You can't invade my office,
put your goon outside...

765
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,456
and jump my intern.

766
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:39,693
I saw them fooling around.

767
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:41,531
May I use your phone?

768
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:43,935
You didn't have something crazy
with Sharon too, did you?

769
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:50,272
You can't have crazy flings
with every woman in town.

770
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:52,681
Hello?

771
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:54,849
Who is this?

772
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,112
Mr. Peter Paul's office.

773
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,082
Please...

774
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:03,115
- You speak English?
- No.

775
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:06,791
Please tell him...

776
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:10,855
Juan is in the hospital.

777
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,298
Lagoa.

778
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:14,266
Emergency.

779
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:18,640
Sharon is not authorized
to speak for the firm.

780
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:24,342
Someone named Juan...
Excuse me!

781
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:30,977
Someone named Juan, I think,
just had a heart attack.

782
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,032
Calm down.

783
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:53,038
And I hung up the phone
on him!

784
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:56,578
It's not your fault he had
a heart attack because of the bakery.

785
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,738
Tailor shop!

786
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:08,489
- Mary Ann?
- Pedro Paulo.

787
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:12,584
How did you find out?

788
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:18,531
He's in intensive care!

789
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:22,702
Nadine, do me a favor.
Find out why those people are here.

790
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:27,843
Excuse me.

791
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:31,037
- Do you speak English?
- Yes, fluently.

792
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:35,678
- You're a friend of Peter Paul's?
- Kind of.

793
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,946
Are you all right?
I mean...

794
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:41,517
- I'm fine.
- Good.

795
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:43,421
Could I borrow a quarter?

796
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:15,648
I've just arrived in Rio...

797
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:18,750
and I will try to get a hold of you
at your other number.

798
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:20,852
Bye-bye.

799
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,926
Excuse me.

800
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:30,302
I need another token.

801
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:35,767
I am so sorry to bother you again,
but I need to call this girl.

802
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:40,044
- Girlfriend.
- Love is a virus.

803
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:11,804
Hello.

804
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:14,940
- <i>Hello. Nadine? </i>
- Who's this?

805
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:19,344
It's me. Gary.

806
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:25,989
Where are you?

807
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:28,825
I'm right behind you.

808
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:02,392
Pedro Paulo, what's wrong?

809
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:09,761
Nadine, what are you doing here?

810
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:15,234
That's Gary.

811
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:40,060
So you don't work
in the multimedia area.

812
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:41,763
Almost.

813
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:45,000
I'm in mergers and acquisitions.

814
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:49,474
And your loft in Soho?

815
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:51,845
New Jersey...

816
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:56,213
and I don't think technically
it could even be called a loft.

817
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,454
I lied too.

818
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:04,555
I'm not the "Girl from Ipanema."

819
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:08,730
Really?

820
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:16,902
<i>For when we leave this world... </i>

821
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:20,407
we actually do not leave.

822
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:24,341
We remain in the hearts...

823
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:27,006
of those who loved us.

824
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:30,617
That is why...

825
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:33,153
the dead sometimes
seem so alive...

826
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:38,582
and the living
seem so dead.

827
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:42,157
Juan Alvarado, my old friend...

828
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:44,061
you left us...

829
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:47,067
but you remain inside us.

830
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,915
How dare she come here!

831
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:13,824
She must be
riddled with guilt.

832
01:12:38,587 --> 01:12:41,215
Excuse me.

833
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:11,037
Want something to eat?

834
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:15,546
- Do you have a beer?
- I have Kirin.

835
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:16,948
What?

836
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:20,451
Kirin. Japanese beer.

837
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:23,915
That'll do.

838
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:49,842
Everything will be fine.

839
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:52,684
Yes.

840
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:57,524
- What did you tell him?
- TheJapanese guy?

841
01:14:58,594 --> 01:14:59,993
Chinese.

842
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:11,561
I told him I was going back
to my husband...

843
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:14,335
and that I still loved you a lot.

844
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:35,490
I'm sorry I'm late.

845
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:40,165
Let's open to chapter 3 5.

846
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:48,372
Who would like
to start reading?

847
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:27,873
London.

848
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,722
I'm gonna make a tape.

849
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:18,095
I realized I might never hear
these songs again.

850
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:21,130
Piaf was infallible.

851
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:23,932
Mother said I was conceived
during " <i>La Vie en Rose. </i>"

852
01:17:25,507 --> 01:17:28,533
For me it was Charles Trenet.
" <i>Que reste</i>-<i>t</i>-<i>il? </i>"

853
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:34,310
No woman could resist
Juan's songs.

854
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:39,020
That wasn't why
I was making the tape...

855
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:40,816
but I'll try it someday.

856
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:44,384
It will be a beautiful tribute.

857
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:47,121
Yes, it will be.

858
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:53,332
Drink?

859
01:17:57,272 --> 01:17:59,399
I'll have one.

860
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:11,382
ToJuan.

861
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:29,560
<i>"Dear Pedro Paulo... </i>

862
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:32,799
<i>here's the Tom Jobim album</i>
<i>that I promised you. </i>

863
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:34,773
<i>So sorry about your father... </i>

864
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:38,209
<i>but glad you and your wife</i>
<i>have resolved your differences. </i>

865
01:18:38,313 --> 01:18:40,645
<i>I am very happy</i>
<i>that we met. </i>

866
01:18:40,749 --> 01:18:44,378
<i>I bid you farewell. </i>
<i>Affectionately, Mary Ann"</i>

867
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:53,127
Okay. I'll call you later.

868
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:54,720
Excuse me.

869
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:57,628
What's the meaning of
"to bid farewell"?

870
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:03,496
It means "to say good-bye."

871
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:13,077
Did you notice
whether Miss Simpson left?

872
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:16,210
Yes, she did.

873
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:18,752
- Are you sure?
- Half an hour ago.

874
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:20,651
You saw her leave?

875
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,951
She took a cab
to the airport.

876
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,392
She is taking a trip.

877
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:38,000
<i>Hundreds of angry fans have gathered</i>
<i>here at Tom Jobim Airport... </i>

878
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:40,700
<i>to protest against the sale</i>
<i>of soccer star Acacio. </i>

879
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:44,404
<i>There is much gossip</i>
<i>about the young girl... </i>

880
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:48,643
<i>who was seen leaving with him</i>
<i>for the airport. </i>

881
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:58,857
On your arrival in London,
you'll have a press conference.

882
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,929
According to the contracts,
you must wear a Nike cap...

883
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:05,295
and the Manchester jersey,
and you must drink Diet Pepsi.

884
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,197
- You got that, Gordo?
- Of course.

885
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:10,601
- Diet Pepsi, NikeJersey...
- Team jersey.

886
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:12,434
That's right. Nike cap.

887
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:16,170
There's a sponsor,
a beer company called...

888
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:18,109
"Winterbreath."

889
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:20,807
They have the right
to tape a commercial.

890
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:22,907
You at the airport,
bottle in hand, saying:

891
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:26,476
"I'm here for Winterbreath."

892
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:35,192
- Did you know that, Gordo?
- Of course.

893
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:37,128
Then say it.

894
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:42,430
"Ladies and gentlemen...

895
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:44,869
I'm here for Wintergrass."

896
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:49,943
What vinaigrette?
It's not a sauce, it's a beer.

897
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:53,105
"I'm here for Winterbreath."

898
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:57,512
- You should be going with me.
- Me?

899
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:01,417
- Gordo, get her a ticket.
- No, you can't be serious.

900
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,684
The flight's sold out.
Filled with reporters.

901
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:06,818
Give her your boarding pass.
You come tomorrow.

902
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:08,486
I can't. No way.

903
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:11,191
You can't just hand over
a boarding pass.

904
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:15,258
Tell the English I'll only go
if she goes.

905
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,531
No. You're crazy.

906
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:19,266
She doesn't even have
a passport.

907
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:23,934
Well, by coincidence,
I happened to bring it.

908
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:32,579
Mercenary! Mercenary!

909
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:38,754
Acacio is now on his way to
the Tom Jobim International Airport...

910
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:55,705
This way.

911
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:04,311
A five-year visa.

912
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:07,013
It's like being approved
by the Vatican to get into heaven!

913
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:08,214
What's she saying?

914
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:11,121
Of course, Gary had to go
to the consulate.

915
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:15,094
- Trevor, please.
- To me you'll be Gary forever.

916
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:17,763
You'd never guess
by the way he looks...

917
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:20,664
how good he is in bed.

918
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:24,068
- Come on, now... in English!
- No, no.

919
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:29,039
Look, I'm really sorry
about the mix-up at the hospital.

920
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:32,636
- I hope your fiance's forgiven me.
- My fiance?

921
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:34,681
Is he still mad?

922
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:36,648
My fiance is fine.

923
01:22:36,751 --> 01:22:40,278
He wanted me to apologize to you
for his hot temper.

924
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:43,789
<i>Acacio is now on his way to</i>
<i>the Tom Jobim International Airport... </i>

925
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:45,985
<i>where he'll be boarding</i>
<i>for London. </i>

926
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:50,360
<i>A group of angry fans</i>
<i>are waiting for him at the entrance. </i>

927
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:54,162
<i>Mercenary! Mercenary! </i>

928
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:13,317
<i>Mercenary! Mercenary! </i>

929
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:18,714
Acacio, how does it feel
to leave Brazil?

930
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:22,490
I feel sad and happy.
Sad because I love Rio.

931
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:27,830
I'm going to miss this city,
my friends, the ocean...

932
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:29,961
because London has no ocean.

933
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,603
What are you doing here?

934
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:40,871
- I came for Acacio's farewell.
- Me too.

935
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:46,920
It's a very important moment
in national sports.

936
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,148
Very important.

937
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:56,459
- Sharon!
- I'm glad I ran into you.

938
01:23:56,564 --> 01:23:59,260
I'm officially resigning
my internship.

939
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:02,700
I need to talk to you.

940
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:05,331
Excuse me.

941
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,707
Here, listen to this.

942
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:20,980
- Who is this?
- Charles Trenet.

943
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:22,056
Who?

944
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:26,627
Let's go.

945
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:30,129
I love it.
Thank you.

946
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:03,423
Miss Simpson.

947
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:09,099
- Please, don't go.
- Don't go where?

948
01:25:09,204 --> 01:25:10,728
Don't go anywhere.

949
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:15,038
- What are you talking about?
- Where are you going?

950
01:25:15,143 --> 01:25:16,838
Nowhere.

951
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,643
Nowhere.

952
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:23,444
Nowhere?

953
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:26,816
Yes, nowhere.
I'm going nowhere.

954
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:30,118
I was just seeing Nadine off.

955
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:00,013
<i>How. </i>
