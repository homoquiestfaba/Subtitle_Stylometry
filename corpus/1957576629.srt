172
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,958
- Yeah, he doesn't matter.
- None of them matter.

173
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,541
Oh, uh…

174
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,375
Nice dog.

175
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,458
I'm gonna go inside the house.

176
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,125
I'm gonna get some stuff.

177
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,458
Hey, careful with that.

178
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,583
- Stay here.
- [clattering]

179
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,666
[Hawking barks]

180
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,291
[groans] Come on.

181
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,458
Ah…

182
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,833
[grunts] Told you to stay in the garage.

183
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,541
And let some creepy dude
just wander around my house alone?

184
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,541
- Yeah…
- I don't think so.

185
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:54,208
Yeah, believe me. I don't wanna be here
any more than you want me here.

186
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,208
I just gotta stop bleeding long enough.

187
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,083
Gotta dress the wound,
prevent a nasty infection,

188
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,208
and I will be on my merry way.

189
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,041
Don't touch that.

190
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,333
- I was just looking.
- Don't touch my stuff.

191
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,250
- Is this a lightsaber?
- No, it's not.

192
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,833
- Okay.
- No. Enough with the bat!

193
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,375
- [clattering]
- If I wanted to hurt you, I would have.

194
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:18,000
If I'm being honest with myself,
you have a very punchable face.

195
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,333
- Oh my...
- God! That...

196
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,208
Gah! That bullet
went straight through. Good.

197
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,375
- Cool.
- Wait, wait, wait. Bullet? You were shot?

198
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,500
Yeah... No, actually, no.

199
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:31,333
No, I was stabbed with a bullet.
What do you think, you moron?

200
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,656
- I'm a moron? You're the one who was shot.
- All right, okay, that's it. [coughs]

201
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,666
- [farting sound]
- That… Wow… That, uh…

202
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,791
That's weird. It farts when I cough.

203
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:39,934
- [coughs]
- [farting sound]

204
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,125
- Gross.
- Super gross.

205
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,833
I'm gonna go upstairs, grab some stuff.
Stay cool. You can trust me.

206
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:48,333
Easy for you to say. I'm the one
who ends up in a therapist's office,

207
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,375
telling them about
where the bad man touched me.

208
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh God! That's where you go?
Immediately? You are dark, man.

209
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:59,333
- [young Adam] Who even are you?
- That is classified.

210
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,041
Why are you here?

211
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,041
- Also classi… classified.
- Are you in the air force?

212
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:08,083
When I say "classified,"
what does your brain hear? Chocolate?

213
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,625
- What's with the lightsaber?
- It's not a lightsaber.

214
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,875
Jesus Christ, Adam.

215
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,392
- I need you to play it cool.
- Wait.

216
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,351
- I know playing it cool isn't your thing.
- Wait.

217
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,041
- It never has been...
- Wait, wait! How do you know my name?

218
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,583
You're Adam Reed.
Born February 10th, 2010.

219
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:31,083
Your parents are Ellie and Louis Reed.
Louis would've died about a year ago.

220
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,708
You don't play any sports
because of acute asthma.

221
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,017
- Plus you're freakishly small for 12.
- [frantic barking]

222
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,833
You go to Franklin Middle School,

223
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,583
where you've been suspended
two, three times for fighting,

224
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,916
which is ironic
because you can't fight to save your life.

225
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,375
[in unison] Hawking! Zip it!

226
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,833
[whines]

227
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,000
How do you know my dog's name?

228
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,958
Because I named him.

229
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,208
- Where are you goin'?
- [gasps]

230
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,458
- [wheezing]
- Oh God.

231
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,833
[shakes inhaler] All right.

232
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,833
Here, ready? Deep breath.

233
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:09,916
Hold it.

234
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,291
Three, two, one.

235
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,500
[exhales]

236
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,833
Everybody gets a trophy.

237
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,000
[grunts]

238
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,416
When I was seven,

239
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,083
I ran into a table on the patio.

240
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,750
I got 12 stitches.

241
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,500
[in unison] Right here.

242
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,708
You knew how to get into my dad's garage.

243
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,291
You knew how to close the fridge.

244
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,208
You knew how to time my breathing.

245
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,708
We have the same scar.

246
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:46,041
And you're wearing my dad's watch.

247
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,458
This watch.

248
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,708
This watch.

249
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,250
You're me.

250
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,625
Holy shi...

251
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,541
That's classified. But yes…

252
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,666
I once was.

253
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,041
- [coughs]
- [wound farts]

254
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,916
I can't believe you're future me.

255
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,500
Okay, you came to terms with that
pretty quickly.

256
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,125
It's a little disturbing, actually.

257
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,458
- So why are you here?
- Rescue mission.

258
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,458
I wasn't supposed to land here.
I was aiming for 2018.

259
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:31,125
- I need to get there as soon as possible.
- Who were you trying to save in 2018?

260
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,125
Really?

261
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,708
Fine. Can you at least tell me
how you got here?

262
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,791
I'll show ya.

263
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,625
[whooshing]

264
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,041
[power crackles and fades]

265
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,125
What was that?

266
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,458
- Crap.
- What?

267
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,875
Uh, we're gonna switch to plan A,
which is where you come in.

268
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,250
You see, time jets,
like all tech in the future,

269
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,333
is coded to its user's DNA.

270
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,875
Because I'm injured… aah,
the jet won't even clear me to fly,

271
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,875
which means
I can't get in there to fix her.

272
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,458
But guess who can?

273
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,541
[whirring]

274
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,833
[power building]

275
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,083
[engine humming]

276
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,583
There she is.

277
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,208
[dramatic music playing]

278
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,708
[Adam] Away we go.

279
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,208
Okay. Sit down.

280
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,083
- Oh my God.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sit down.

281
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,750
Let's see what we're dealing with here.
All right, some minor shield damage.

282
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,500
- Coolant leaks.
- [beeping]

283
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,750
I don't know what that is, but when
is a flashing red light ever good?

284
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:06,875
Ah-da-da-da-da-da.

285
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,333
I know you wanna touch
all the pretty buttons

286
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:13,750
with your sticky little child fingers,
but the reactor has a quantum signature.

287
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,791
You fire it up, they can find us.

288
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,666
If they're here.

289
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,666
Who are "they"?

290
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,958
I'm glad that you didn't ask me that
because "they" are classified.

291
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:25,208
- I already know you're from the future.
- Believe me, I regret that.

292
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,875
I had no intention of coming back
to revisit… this.

293
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,291
Jesus. Okay.

294
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,500
[chiming]

295
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,958
Okay, I've isolated the damaged relays,

296
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:39,125
so the ship should be able
to start repairing itself.

297
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,541
How long will that take?

298
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,000
Ah, it's at 50% capacity,

299
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,708
so hopefully less time
than it takes me to heal.

300
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:45,791
[young Adam] Wait.

301
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,458
- Do you remember this?
- Remember what?

302
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,250
This. Right here, right now.

303
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,000
You being here in 2022?

304
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,642
- Know where you're going with this.
- If this is happening to me...

305
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,309
- You're wasting your time.
- That means it already happened to you.

306
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,958
Unless it works like a multiverse,

307
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,892
where each ripple creates
an alternate timeline...

308
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,125
It's not a multiverse!

309
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,500
My God, we watched too many movies.

310
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:06,833
I just wanna know.

311
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:08,625
[sighs]

312
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:10,833
Okay.

313
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:16,083
Okay, the prevailing wisdom
is that when I go back to my fixed time,

314
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,291
my memory… our memories,
they reform, they reconcile.

315
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,708
- But not while I'm here.
- Fixed time? What's that?

316
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:27,333
There's only one place in time
where you belong on a quantum level,

317
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,166
where you're not screwing around
with the cosmos like I am.

318
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,500
That is your fixed time.

319
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,500
Where you actually belong.

320
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,833
So by being here and telling me this,

321
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,416
you may have just changed my whole future?

322
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,625
Honestly? Your future
is pretty tragic either way.

323
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,166
[laughs] I'm kidding! I'm kidding.

324
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,250
I'm not kidding.

325
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,083
I'm kidding. Let's go.
Come on. Here we go.

326
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,250
[young Adam] So what happens now?

327
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,458
Nothin'. I'm just gonna lay down.
Let this bullet wound heal.

328
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,833
Think about some key
investment opportunities for your future.

329
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,958
- Wait, like Biff from <i>Back to the...</i>
- Are you out of your tiny mind?

330
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,708
Get back in the house before our mother
gets home, and don't make it weird.

331
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:07,875
- [sniffles]
- Hey.

332
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,458
[frustratedly] Yes?

333
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,833
- This is amazing.
- Isn't it, though?

334
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,958
Mind hitting the light on your way out?

335
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,000
- [door closes]
- [sighs]

336
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,708
[Ellie sighs]

337
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,750
Oh, hey. I'm surprised you're still up.

338
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,458
Well, this night's been
full of surprises, mother.

339
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,781
That's chilling. What happened?

340
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:59,166
How was your not-a-date?
Will you be seeing him again?

341
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,583
- No. I don't know. I don't think so.
- [knocking at door]

342
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,208
- Hi.
- Hi.

343
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,875
- Me again.
- Yes, it is.

344
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,583
You left your scarf in my car.

345
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,250
- I did. Gosh, thanks.
- [Derek] Oh, hey there, kiddo.

346
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:17,083
Oh. This is my son, Adam.
Adam, this is Derek.

347
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,208
Oh, hey, Adam.

348
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,583
Hello. You have a wonderful mouth mullet.
You must be very proud.

349
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,000
Oh my gosh, Adam. [laughs]

350
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:26,250
- Never heard it called that before.
- Well, thanks again.

351
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,333
Sure. See you soon.

352
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,541
Unlikely, but I'll put in
a good word for you.

353
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,791
Okay. Okay. I'll see you at work.

354
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:33,875
- [Derek] Yeah.
- Bye.

356
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,458
He seems nice.

357
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,458
What?

358
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,750
You can be a real jerk sometimes.

359
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,500
You know that? [sighs]

Shouldn't you be at work?

363
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,416
Yeah, I need to pay the insurance
on the house today.

364
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,666
Had it in the calendar,
but I can't find the statement.

365
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,375
[Adam] With <i>that </i>filing system?

366
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,416
Shocking. It should all be online.

367
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,791
The minute I find myself
with a few extra hours,

368
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,791
I will set up those accounts.

369
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,916
Until then, this is how your dad did it.

370
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,000
Hey, grab a pile.

371
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,041
Sorry. I gotta get to my room
to think about what I've done.

372
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,166
Okay.

373
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,250
I gotta go.

374
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,625
Call me if you need me.

375

and a closet full of his clothes

How does that work? You just missed?

Ship was comin' apart.

443
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,416
I jammed the coordinates.
I didn't have time to double-check 'em.

444
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,666
- Wait, you stole the jet?
- It's encoded to me.

445
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,791
So I didn't exactly steal it.
I borrowed the shit out of it.

446
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:18,750
- There's a difference. Give me some cash.
- You don't have money?

and you have a big mouth.

He doesn't wanna fight.

- I don't wanna fight either.
- He doesn't know that, does he?

I will sharpen them.

505
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:02,833
- I will use them to stab little Chuckie.
- What did I do?

506
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:05,375
Shut your mouth,
or I'll fill it with Ray's feet.

507
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,958
You understand what I'm saying?
Got all of it? The bones?

508
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,517
- Yeah.
- Your feet in Chuckie's mouth?

509
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:12,625
- [liquid running]
- Good. Are you peeing right now?

510
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:14,375
- Yeah.
- You're a real streamer.

511
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:17,250
Get yourself home and clean yourself up.

512
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,541
Be the change you wanna see, okay?

513
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,041
God, I hated those assholes.

514
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:33,208
[birdsong]

515
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:51,541
Oh, come on.

516
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:53,041
Hey, Adam.

517
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,541
Get out of my stuff and open the door.

518
00:27:58,166 --> 00:28:00,125
Put the drone down. It will kill us both.

519
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:03,583
Hey, look, you lost one fight.
I figured you'd be used to that by now.

520
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:06,083
You coulda helped. You just stood there.

521
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:08,375
Christ. You're so sensitive.

522
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:10,375
Hey, you had to lose that fight.

523
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:12,875
You had to. Trust me.

524
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:17,625
You don't go from bein' you to bein' me
without gettin' your ass kicked,

525
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:19,500
a lot, all the time.

526
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:25,958
I'm sorry if I went too far today.

527
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:28,458
Shouldn't have done that.

528
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,250
- [young Adam] Who's this?
- Who's who?

529
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:36,291
Put that back.

530
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:38,250
You put that back.

531
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,083
As soon as you tell me who she is.

532
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:44,916
That's my wife, Laura.

533
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:46,791
We have a wife?

534
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,916
No, we do not have a wife anymore.

535
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:14,708
- [Ellie] Hey.
- Hi.

536
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:18,208
- [man] Aah. Hi, there. How are you?
- Hey, Paul.

537
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:20,250
[Paul] Been a while.

538
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:23,291
[Ellie] Yep, how you doin'?
That baby sleeping yet?

539
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:24,875
Uh, not really. No.

540
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:27,541
[chuckles] No. Well, you'll miss
those days when they're gone.

541
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:29,208
Ah, I find that hard to believe.

542
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:32,541
[Ellie] Believe it. Babies are pure love.

543
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:36,291
They grow into teenagers,
who grow into be assassins of happiness.

544
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,583
Thank you, thank you.

545
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:40,708
Mm, well,
somethin' to look forward to. [chuckles]

546
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:42,958
Sorry. It's been a rough day.

547
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:45,833
Year. Couple of years.

548
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:48,375
Hmm. Your boy still havin' a hard time?

549
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:49,875
[sighs]

550
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,291
He hates me.

551
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,333
[Paul] Hmm.

552
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:56,958
It's not his fault.
He's… he's just dealing.

553
00:29:57,041 --> 00:30:00,291
It's fine. We'll be fine.
It's good. Good, good, good.

554
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:04,125
I wish I knew what I was doin' wrong.

555
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:05,708
You're not doin' anything wrong.

556
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,208
Sorry. [laughs]

557
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:10,166
- I'm sorry.
- [laughing] Sorry, you scared me.

558
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,208
- I was eavesdropping. I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

559
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:14,875
[chuckles] You're right, though.
Teenage boys are horrible.

560
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:18,458
It's like living with a urinal cake
that yells at you.

561
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:19,625
[laughs]

562
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,916
Mothers are usually the ones
who take the hit.

563
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:23,625
Yeah.

564
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:26,833
- But I'll tell you somethin'.
- Mmm?

565
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,125
Boys always come back for their mamas.

566
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,666
That's nice.

567
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:38,750
It sounds like
you're speaking from experience.

568
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
I am.

569
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,458
You have a good mom?

570
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,083
- [Adam] I do.
- Oh.

571
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:45,791
[whispers] I have the best mom.

572
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:49,458
Good.

573
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,333
I hope you're right.

574
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:56,583
I'm still researching boarding schools
in Fallujah, so…

575
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:58,333
- Good.
- [both laugh]

576
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:02,291
No, I don't mean that.
He's such a sweet kid.

577
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm crazy about him.

578
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:07,958
We lost his dad in a car accident
year before last.

579
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:10,625
Yeah. That's tough.

580
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:12,541
Yeah. You have no idea.

581
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,958
Well, I have some idea.

582
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,333
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

583
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:19,625
Jinx.

584
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:22,125
- Thank you.
- [Adam] Thank you.

585
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:30,291
Aren't you grieving too?

586
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,166
- Yeah.
- [Adam] Yeah.

587
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,416
I am. Of course I am.

588
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:41,458
So tell him.

589
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,291
You should tell him.

590
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:47,000
I don't think he needs it.

591
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,750
You think you're being strong for him,

592
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:52,458
and the problem with acting
like you have it all together is…

593
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:53,791
He believes it.

594
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:03,166
Maybe he needs to know that you don't.

595
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:06,166
It's okay if you don't.

596
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,666
[Adam chuckles]

597
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:18,250
My husband had a jacket just like that.

598
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,500
Oh, this is a classic.

599
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,208
Yeah.

600
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:28,625
It was really nice chatting with you.
I'll see you later.

601
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:30,916
Oh, hey, um…

602
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,375
He doesn't hate you.

603
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,875
He loves you.

604
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:38,458
More than he knows.

605
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:51,958
Hey! Hey!

606
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,541
[breathing heavily]

607
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
[engines rumbling]

608
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:16,541
[bleeping]

609
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:18,125
Locked and docked.

610
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,750
Start the area scans for his jet.

611
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,930
Let's find him
and get the hell outta here.

612
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:25,083
[stomps]

613
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:26,958
Find him.

614
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,250
[cutlery clinking]

615
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,500
- So you came back for your wife, Laura?
- We're not getting into that.

616
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:40,958
Hey, she's my wife too.

617
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:43,708
- You know what? We should get into that.
- Thank you.

618
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:48,208
Met in the academy.

619
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,333
She was 20 minutes late
to the wrong classroom

620
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,208
in the wrong building.

621
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,333
I offered to walk her
to the right one, and…

622
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:00,916
Man, I was all in
before we even made it outside.

623
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,708
A couple of years ago,
she didn't come back from a jump.

624
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:10,375
They told me her jet broke up on reentry,
but she was the best pilot in the program.

625
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:14,000
She wrote the book on reentry.
Didn't make sense.

626
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:18,291
And you were trying to get to 2018
'cause that's where she went before?

627
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:19,541
Yeah.

628
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:22,083
- What was she doing there?
- I don't know.

629
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:23,791
They changed the jump logs.

630
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,458
Somebody was hidin' somethin'.

631
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:28,666
Maybe she saw something
Sorian didn't want her to see.

632
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,333
Wait, "Sorian"?
Maya Sorian, Dad's partner?

633
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:33,208
- She was always so nice to me.
- Hmm.

634
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:36,083
Yeah, trust me. She's no friend.

635
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:37,166
Nope.

636
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,791
After Dad died,
she got rich off of his tech.

637
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:42,333
Bought all the right people.

638
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,083
Next thing you know,

639
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:47,583
she has exclusive control
over the most valuable resource on Earth,

640
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:49,375
time.

641
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:54,416
Wait a minute.
You're saying Dad invented time travel?

642
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Yeah.

643
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:57,000
Not on purpose.

644
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:01,041
The magnetic particle accelerator.
Remember that?

645
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,500
He called it The Adam Project.

646
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:05,333
[Adam] Yeah, or as I like to call it,
his favorite child.

647
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,083
So what happened to Laura?

648
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:12,166
Mmm. Well, I think your nice friend Maya
had her killed.

649
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,000
- What?
- Yeah.

650
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:16,416
That's why I gotta get back to 2018
as soon as possible.

651
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,625
The jet's almost ready.
I'll lay low in the shed.

652
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:21,333
I'll heal for a few more days
until I can get a clean read

653
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:22,791
and then fly out of your life.

654
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:24,791
But going back to save her.

655
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,291
- Talking to me.
- [whines]

656
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:29,958
Everything you're doing right now
just to rescue one person.

657
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:33,125
You're changing the future.
That's gotta be against the rules.

658
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:35,291
You'll feel differently when you meet her.

659
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:36,958
[rattling]

660
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:39,125
- And when you lose her.
- What?

661
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:42,875
[shushes] Grab that bag. Get ready to run.

662
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:44,416
Why? What's happening?

663
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:47,791
We're going that way. Be ready.

664
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:51,083
[whirrs]

665
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,083
[whooshing]

666
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,375
- [crackling]
- [groaning]

667
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:06,583
- Move!
- [whooshing]

668
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,916
[Adam grunting]

669
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:23,666
[groaning]

670
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,791
[grunts]

671
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:29,000
Stay behind me. [exhales]

672
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:31,625
Don't you do it! Don't you do it, Reed!

673
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:33,041
Wanna see something cool?

674
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:34,333
[clanking and whirring]

675
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:37,541
- That's a lightsaber, dude.
- Quiet now.

676
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:42,833
[grunting]

677

[Adam] Christos. They'll let anyone
into this time stream.

Who's that?

683
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:12,166
That's Christos.
We were in the academy together.

684
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,375
He's a decent pilot but a terrible person.

685
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:15,958
He runs security for Sorian.

686
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:18,416
Ouchie, with the face. Did I do that?

687
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,041
God, I hope the boss lets me kill you.

688
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:23,708
[chuckles] In fairness,
though, you did shoot me first.

689
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:27,041
On the bright side, your…
your face now matches your soul.

690

- Anyone say you talk too much?
- All the time.

- It's come up.
- [Sorian] That's enough.

692
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:35,666
Adam, before this goes any further,
let's just go home, please.

How did it come back if it never left?

Unless someone went back
and altered the time stream,

780
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:55,583
so the future the jet had left from
had already been changed.

some kind of future intel.

What for?

to amass her fortune

799
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,666
and get rid of
whatever political obstacles

of the time program.

by Sorian.

You already had my childhood.

You had adventures, you flew planes,

You wander around school
without making a social dent.

after a year, you lose your scholarship

[Louis] Sophie, you can do this.

1019
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:03,000
Listen, guys,
that is the beauty of physics.

1020
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:05,333
[voice fading] That is the beauty of life…

1021
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:08,416
[inaudible]

1022
00:57:18,541 --> 00:57:19,625
It's really him.

1023
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:21,083
[Louis] Now, guys.

1024
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:23,416
- Yep.
- [Louis] If you think you've got…

1025
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,375
He's so…

1026
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:25,625
[Adam] Yeah.

1027
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:28,791
Alive. Come here for a second. Hey.

1028
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:33,041
- Let me do the talking in there.
- We have to tell him what happens.

1029
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:35,208
- He doesn't have to die.
- We say nothing, okay?

1030
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:37,500
Only what he needs to know.
Everything else…

1031
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:39,625
We can't.

1032
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,125
I wanna hear you say it,
"I won't tell him." Say it.

1033
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,041
- Say it.
- I won't tell him.

1034
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,541
Physics is a slog. It's a slog.

1035
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:57,625
We are meant to work on problems
that our children will solve.

1036
00:57:57,708 --> 00:58:00,416
You might find the odd solution
here or there.

1037
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,333
I just got your shirt, by the way.
It's very clever.

1038
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:07,708
But you will die
before your life's work is done.

1039
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:11,083
Your cold, lifeless husk
will be moldering in the ground

1040
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:13,833
while generations that come after you

1041
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:16,166
will be finishing the work
that you started.

1042
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:18,250
To quote the Romans,

1043
00:58:18,958 --> 00:58:20,500
"Enjoy yourselves.

1044
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:22,833
It's later than you think."

1045
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,166
[Adam] Guy Lombardo.

1046
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:26,125
[Louis laughs]

1047
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:28,958
- I am s… I'm sorry?
- [Adam] Guy Lombardo. That was… Yeah.

1048
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:32,125
The quote, um… "It's later
than you think." It's not the Romans.

1049
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:35,375
It's a singer.
Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians.

1050
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:37,166
It was Guy Lombardo,

1051
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:40,875
and it was from his 1949 classic,
"Enjoy Yourself."

1052
00:58:40,958 --> 00:58:42,333
But long before that,

1053
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:45,458
it was the Romans
who etched it on their sundials.

1054
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:46,791
So, uh… so we're both right.

1055
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:49,625
It's interesting that you, uh…
you know that.

1056
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:51,708
I'm sorry, do I know you?

1057
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,416
Just auditing the class. [chuckles]

1058
00:58:57,541 --> 00:58:58,666
Any other questions?

1059
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:00,208
[alarm beeps]

1060
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:06,083
All right, the, uh, reading's
on my website, and I'll see you Tuesday.

1061
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:20,958
Adam?

1062
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:24,541
Dad.

1063
00:59:25,416 --> 00:59:26,416
Dad.

1064
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:28,291
[Louis] Adam?

1065
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:39,833
Is… is this time travel?

1066
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:46,541
- [Louis] He came from 2050 and got you?
- [young Adam] Yes.

1067
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:48,385
- How old are you now?
- [young Adam] Twelve.

1068
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:51,125
- Why did you need your 12-year-old self?
- [Adam] I didn't.

1069
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:54,250
- You needed me to fly the jet.
- Jet? There… there's a jet?

1070
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:55,208
- My jet.
- Oh.

1071
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,091
What I meant was
I didn't need you originally.

1072
00:59:57,125 --> 00:59:58,500
- 2022 was a mistake.
- Wh...

1073
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:00,500
And you flew this jet?

1074
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:02,041
- Yes.
- Did you, though?

1075
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:05,416
- Is that my jacket? Looks tight on you.
- That's what I said.

1076
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,140
- It's fine.
- Like a condom with buttons.

1077
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:09,101
- This is fun. I'm having fun, are you?
- Condom!

1078
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:11,208
And why was 2022 a mistake?

1079
01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:13,958
- I wasn't supposed to be there.
- You're not supposed to be <i>here.</i>

1080
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:16,458
- You don't say.
- They shot him when he stole the jet.

1081
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:18,625
- Please don't tell him that.
- You stole a jet?

1082
01:00:18,708 --> 01:00:22,375
- Why would he need to know that?
- Okay, stop. Both of you stop talking now.

1083
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:25,291
Do you realize
how absolutely wrong this is?

1084
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:28,583
You can't be here. You can't be anywhere
but your own timeline.

1085
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:32,333
What do you think we're doin' here?
Think we're short of hugs in the future?

1086
01:00:32,416 --> 01:00:35,208
- There's a reason I need to talk to you.
- I don't... I don't care.

1087
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:37,041
- He doesn't care.
- Don't get me wrong.

1088
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:40,291
I'm very happy to see you,
and I mean this in the best possible way,

1089
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:42,791
but you need to piss off
to where you came from.

1090
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:45,958
Anything you say or do
could cause a divergence.

1091
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:47,875
Can you please shut up for a second?

1092
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:50,041
- I'm not gonna listen...
- For a second and listen.

1093
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:53,208
- Shut the physics fountain in your face.
- What you are doing is reckless.

1094
01:00:53,291 --> 01:00:54,125
- Dad!
- [groans]

1095
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:55,208
[young Adam] You okay?

1096
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:57,000
- God damn it!
- [groaning]

1097
01:00:57,083 --> 01:00:59,000
- [Adam] In fairness, I...
- It's okay.

1098
01:00:59,083 --> 01:01:01,125
I asked him nicely
to shut up and listen.

1099
01:01:01,208 --> 01:01:03,708
- He did no such thing, so…
- It's okay. It's fine. I'm fine.

1100
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:05,333
So... Oh, you…

1101
01:01:05,416 --> 01:01:08,333
That's what you get.
We don't hit people in this family.

1102
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:09,416
What was that?

1103
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,083
- That's what you get.
- God!

1104
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:14,083
How did you turn out to be an asshole?
I thought you loved me.

1105
01:01:14,166 --> 01:01:15,875
- I do!
- None of it matters anymore.

1106
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:18,666
- Are you kidding me? Of course it matters.
- Dad.

1107
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,666
They don't have safeguards
where you come from?

1108
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:21,583
- Dad.
- Protocols?

1109
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:22,833
- Maya and I agreed.
- Dad.

1110
01:01:22,916 --> 01:01:24,500
- There'd be an ethics panel...
- Dad!

1111
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:25,708
With real oversight.

1112
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:27,500
None of it matters anymore.

1113
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:37,416
Wait. It already happened?
Somebody already altered time?

1114
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,291
- Who?
- Sorian.

1115
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,166
- Maya?
- Maya.

1116
01:01:42,791 --> 01:01:44,916
She'd never do that.
She knows the consequences.

1117
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,958
- She's been funding my work for years.
- The Adam Project.

1118
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:51,375
Yes, I theorized
that with a powerful enough pulse,

1119
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,875
we could generate
utilitarian wormholes in space.

1120
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:56,375
And we did it four weeks ago.

1121
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:59,833
But I was…
I was just playing with the theory

1122
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:02,208
that you can use wormholes
for time travel.

1123
01:02:02,291 --> 01:02:03,625
That part's theoretical.

1124
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:04,809
- Right.
- Still theoretical.

1125
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:06,916
This theory needs to take a leak.
So let's go.

1126
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,666
Holy shit!
I'm the godfather of time travel?

1127
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:13,708
Nice hit, Dad.

1128
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:15,666
[whispers] I think I broke my hand.

1129
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:21,250
[Louis] I'm… I'm sorry. This is my fault.

1130
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:23,250
My… my ego. My hubris.

1131
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:26,625
My need to be best, to be first,
to be the smartest guy in the room.

1132
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:27,541
And here we are.

1133
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:29,666
- A disgusting character flaw.
- He didn't know.

1134
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,416
- [Louis] But I should have.
- Yeah.

1135
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:35,458
Mankind has no business tampering
with the mechanics of the universe.

1136
01:02:35,541 --> 01:02:37,541
There are forces greater than science.

1137
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:40,105
Right. That's why we're gonna
put the genie back in the bottle.

1138
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:42,833
Destroy time travel
before it's even invented.

1139
01:02:42,916 --> 01:02:43,916
Uh...

1140
01:02:44,291 --> 01:02:47,083
What's done, no matter how terrible,

1141
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:50,583
should not and cannot be undone
under any circumstance.

1142
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:54,250
Even us being here, talking like this,
we're perverting fate and time.

1143
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:57,708
I told you Sorian already did that.
She's had the world by the balls since.

1144
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,250
And you know that for a fact?

1145
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:01,958
Do you have scientific proof
that she changed things?

1146
01:03:02,041 --> 01:03:05,250
No, you don't because you can't know.
But I will tell you this.

1147
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:10,250
You being here opens up the potential
for catastrophic reconfiguration.

1148
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:12,666
- And that <i>is </i>quantifiable, that...
- Stop. Stop.

1149
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:13,958
- Stop.
- Stop what?

1150
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:16,166
- Stop being a scientist.
- But I am a scient...

1151
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,250
Be a father.

1152
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:22,500
You were always more interested
in the universe than your son.

1153
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:24,059
- That's not true.
- [Adam] That is true.

1154
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:26,375
And when you're older,
you'll realize that. It...

1155
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:27,708
You know what? It's…

1156
01:03:28,916 --> 01:03:32,750
That ship has sailed. It's too late
for me. So, you know, whatever. I'm fine.

1157
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:34,875
But he needs you.

1158
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:40,583
[Louis] Hmm.

1159
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:43,583
And you? What do you need?

1160
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:48,875
[chuckles]

1161
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:53,083
I need to go for a walk.

1162
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,875
[door opens]

1163
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:09,833
I can't be here, Adam. I… I have to go.

1164
01:04:11,166 --> 01:04:12,875
- Please don't go.
- I have to.

1165
01:04:12,958 --> 01:04:15,125
- Please.
- This is… this is bigger than any of us.

1166
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:17,916
It's too dangerous
what he's asking me to do. I can't.

1167
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:26,500
All right. We'll see each other again.

1168
01:04:31,166 --> 01:04:32,166
Wait.

1169
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,041
- I need to tell you something.
- No, you can't say anything else to me.

1170
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,958
I can't know the future.

1171
01:04:42,666 --> 01:04:43,708
I'm sorry.

1172
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:47,333
I have to go home.
Your mom and you are waiting.

1173
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:03,541
[woman] Yes, Senator.

1174
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:07,375
Except the stability of these wormholes
is no longer a hypothetical,

1175
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:11,708
and the work we are doing here
is simply ahead of the current statutes.

1176
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:15,625
So you can either support my program
and be a part of the future,

1177
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:17,875
or you can get left behind in the past.

1178
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:19,333
[Sorian] Hang up the phone.

1179
01:05:23,208 --> 01:05:26,625
What are you doing here?
You said I wouldn't be seeing you again.

1180
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:28,208
Did I? Hmm.

1181
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:30,250
When was that? Remind me.

1182
01:05:30,333 --> 01:05:33,541
[Maya] The last time
you just showed up, two months ago.

1183
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:37,541
Oh, well, for me, it was 32 years ago.

1184
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:40,291
So sorry if I'm a little fuzzy
on the details.

1185
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:43,583
Anyway, times have changed.

1186
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:44,958
You can't be here.

1187
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:49,125
You know the potential for
catastrophic changes to the time stream.

1188
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,934
- It's incalculable.
- God, I was such a nerd.

1189
01:05:50,958 --> 01:05:52,416
Will you please just stop talking?

1190
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,875
Everything you asked me to do.

1191
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:58,000
The stock buys, the offshore accounts,
all of it. It's unethical.

1192
01:05:58,083 --> 01:06:01,666
- And illegal.
- This isn't a joke. It's dangerous.

1193
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:06,000
The environmental impact alone
from the companies you had me pick

1194
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:07,458
could be devastating.

1195
01:06:07,541 --> 01:06:08,625
In fairness to us,

1196
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:11,375
the environment was pretty much toast
before we came along.

1197
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:14,583
And by the way, Maya,
you did it, all of it,

1198
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:19,916
because somewhere inside that cheap suit
and ridiculous ponytail is me.

1199
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:23,375
I'm leaving.

1200
01:06:23,875 --> 01:06:24,875
Where you going?

1201
01:06:26,625 --> 01:06:27,708
You seeing someone?

1202
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,041
No, you're not. You're too busy.

1203
01:06:31,541 --> 01:06:33,750
[clicks tongue] Thing is,
you always will be.

1204
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:37,041
This company is all you will ever have.

1205
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:38,916
- [sighs]
- It is your personal life.

1206
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:41,083
It's your family.

1207
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,916
But this is our legacy.

1208
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:50,166
And if we had let the government
take it from us,

1209
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:52,458
then everything we sacrificed,

1210
01:06:53,166 --> 01:06:55,291
all that loneliness,

1211
01:06:56,791 --> 01:06:58,208
all that loneliness,

1212
01:06:59,458 --> 01:07:00,708
would've been for nothing.

1213
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:02,916
And I did it.

1214
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,708
I fixed that future
where we had been forgotten.

1215
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:11,458
Then why are you back here now?

1216
01:07:12,541 --> 01:07:13,583
I'm back

1217
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:17,791
because we can't control time travel
if it never existed.

1218
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:21,291
And your buddy Adam Reed
is about to betray you.

1219
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:23,625
Adam? He's just a little kid.

1220
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:26,791
Yeah, well, that little kid…

1221
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:30,000
[laughs] …he grows up
to be a very big pain in our ass.

1222
01:07:30,625 --> 01:07:33,458
[sighs] Trust me. You're gonna want this.

1223
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:38,375
[crickets chirping]

1224
01:07:40,833 --> 01:07:42,208
[door opens]

1225
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:45,208
[door closes]

1226
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:55,875
What?

1227
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:59,458
I know you think you know more than me
because you're older.

1228
01:07:59,541 --> 01:08:01,291
Go away, Adam. [sighs]

1229
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:03,958
And I know why you hate him so much.

1230
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:06,916
Really?

1231
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:10,208
[laughs] Well, do tell.
I'm on the edge of my seat here.

1232
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:14,083
Holy shit. I wonder what it i...
Was it because he's narcissistic,

1233
01:08:14,166 --> 01:08:16,375
or, uh, never came home from work

1234
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:18,208
or cared more about his job than his son...

1235
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:19,541
It's because he died.

1236
01:08:22,291 --> 01:08:23,333
You hate him

1237
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:25,666
because he died.

1238
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:31,083
You <i>made </i>yourself hate him

1239
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:34,083
because it was easier than missing him.

1240
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:37,458
And I remember some stuff
that you maybe don't wanna.

1241
01:08:37,541 --> 01:08:38,541
Oh yeah?

1242
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:40,583
Like what?

1243
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:42,708
He played catch with us

1244
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,166
almost every night.

1245
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:46,250
Catch.

1246
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,083
He'd get home from work,

1247
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:53,875
be so tired, and I'd be in the yard
throwing the ball against the pitch back.

1248
01:08:53,958 --> 01:08:57,333
- You remember the pitch back, right?
- Oh, I… I remember the pitch back.

1249
01:08:57,416 --> 01:09:00,125
Yeah, he bought it
so he didn't have to play with me.

1250
01:09:00,208 --> 01:09:01,208
Nope.

1251
01:09:03,083 --> 01:09:06,250
He bought it because they had one
in the window of Altman's.

1252
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:11,583
And every time we passed that store,

1253
01:09:11,666 --> 01:09:14,083
I begged him to buy it for me,

1254
01:09:14,166 --> 01:09:15,625
so that's what Dad did.

1255
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:21,333
He'd see me throwin' in the yard,
and no matter how tired he was,

1256
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:24,541
he'd always grab his mitt
to come out for a catch.

1257
01:09:26,083 --> 01:09:28,625
Things happened to you, to us.

1258
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,541
And we suck at dealing with it.

1259
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,430
I'm starting to think
it's something we do.

1260
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,375
I give Mom a hard time now, and…

1261
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:40,375
I think…

1262
01:09:43,208 --> 01:09:45,833
I think it's easier to be angry
than it is to be sad.

1263
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:49,375
And I guess, when I get older,

1264
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:52,583
I forget that there's a difference.

1265
01:09:58,458 --> 01:10:00,291
How'd you get to be so smart?

1266
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:02,291
How'd you get to be so dumb?

1267
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:13,416
[sighs]

1268
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:21,708
Nice try, asshole.

1269
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:26,666
[Ellie] Adam, make sure you feed Hawking
before you leave for school, honey.

1270
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:28,666
- Oh.
- [sizzling]

1271
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:30,500
- You're still here.
- [Louis] Oh.

1272
01:10:30,583 --> 01:10:32,500
And you're cooking.
What are you making? Hi.

1273
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:34,625
Uh, I know you like the Denver omelet.

1274
01:10:35,458 --> 01:10:38,583
That's not a Denver omelet.
That is a cry for help.

1275
01:10:38,666 --> 01:10:41,625
The eggs are burnt, and the bacon's
still somehow totally raw.

1276
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:43,666
Oh, you… Oh, no, no. No, no, no. Wha...

1277
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:45,833
Do you wanna talk about
why you're still here

1278
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:47,291
instead of being at work?

1279
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:50,583
I… I… Well, I just wanted to stay home
with you today.

1280
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:54,291
You don't say. I like this guy.

1281
01:10:54,958 --> 01:10:56,041
This guy likes you.

1282
01:10:58,208 --> 01:10:59,958
What's going on with you, honey?

1283
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:04,583
Does he seem, uh… does he seem sad to you?

1284
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:06,208
No.

1285
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:09,916
He's an odd duck, like his dad.

1286
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:13,250
I happen to collect odd ducks.

1287
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:17,500
I don't know
if I should've built that game for him.

1288
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:20,166
Shouldn't he be outside,
playing with the rest of the kids?

1289
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:22,291
How is he gonna find his place
in the world?

1290
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:26,166
"His place in the world"?
He's a kid. We're his place in the world.

1291
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:28,000
<i>You're</i> his place in the world.

1292
01:11:29,166 --> 01:11:33,875
[sighs] Okay, whatever is going on,
listen, I can tell you the truth

1293
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:36,708
or something
that's gonna make you feel better.

1294
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:39,351
I'd rather cut to it and tell you
the truth, if you're up for it.

1295
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:41,708
I… I'd rather something
that'll make me feel better.

1296
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:43,125
[laughs] Yeah, I know.

1297
01:11:43,625 --> 01:11:45,250
Kidding. Sort of.

1298
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,291
Okay, tell me.

1299
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:49,708
When you are with us… [clicks tongue]

1300
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:52,041
…you're with us 100%.

1301
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:53,958
It's amazing.

1302
01:11:54,708 --> 01:11:56,333
And when you're not…

1303
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:58,875
[laughs] …it's like… pfft.

1304
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:01,500
So is he a little lonely?

1305
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,666
Yeah, probably.

1306
01:12:04,166 --> 01:12:06,208
But does that make you a shitty guy? No.

1307
01:12:06,291 --> 01:12:07,791
I've gotta do better.

1308
01:12:07,875 --> 01:12:10,958
Hey, buddy, I have good news for you.

1309
01:12:11,041 --> 01:12:14,333
He doesn't need perfect.
He just needs you.

1310
01:12:15,208 --> 01:12:18,000
Your cooking makes you
a borderline serial killer,

1311
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:20,333
but the rest of you is pretty awesome.

1312
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:21,958
Ellie.

1313
01:12:23,708 --> 01:12:25,000
You know I love you.

1314
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:26,333
Yeah, I know.

1315
01:12:26,416 --> 01:12:28,375
I'm extremely lovable.

1316
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Yeah.

1317
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:41,750
[Ellie] Hmm.

1318
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:43,708
I have to go to work.

1319
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:45,250
Okay, okay, okay.

1320
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:47,791
- And, hey, you got time.
- [sighs]

1321
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:53,333
"It's later than you think."

1322
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:58,833
[ominous music playing]

1323
01:13:05,041 --> 01:13:06,375
[young Adam] Really think we can?

1324
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:09,291
Maybe, maybe not. We'll see.

1325
01:13:10,125 --> 01:13:11,916
But we're gonna try anyway.

1326
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,916
Destroy time travel. How will we do that?

1327
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,250
This is the world's largest
electromagnetic accelerator.

1328
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:20,416
It's 2018,
so EM technology isn't stable yet.

1329
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:23,750
So here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna blow this bitch up.

1330
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:25,291
- Blow it up?
- Yep.

1331
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:28,000
How did I live this long?
That's a terrible idea.

1332
01:13:28,083 --> 01:13:31,916
Yeah, well, when a bad idea
is the only idea, it becomes a great idea.

1333
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:32,875
Who said that?

1334
01:13:32,958 --> 01:13:35,666
You. Nine years from now,
right before you get arrested.

1335
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:36,875
- What?
- Try to focus.

1336
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:40,166
We'll have to deal with security.
You know this bag of toys you love?

1337
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,416
Yeah.

1338
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,958
Being a geek is about to pay off.

1339
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:50,875
- Reading me?
- [young Adam] <i>Roger that, Red Leader.</i>

1340
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:53,708
This is Butternut Sippy Cup.
Ten-four, over.

1341
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:55,833
Let's just talk like normal people, okay?

1342
01:13:55,916 --> 01:13:56,958
[young Adam] <i>Copy that…</i>

1343
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:58,458
<i>Red Leader.</i>

1344
01:13:58,875 --> 01:13:59,958
Somethin's wrong.

1345
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:02,666
There's nobody here.

1346
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:04,666
Which means <i>they're </i>here.

1347

We're taking you back to 2050, Reed.

I can't hear you through the helmet.
It muffles a bit. It's hard to hear you.

What are you doin' here?

1385
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:00,750
I went to the motel,
and when I didn't find you there,

1386
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:02,666
I… I figured I'd find you here.

1387

It's not like

and we'll do it your way. Sound good?

Oh God. Thank God. There's a plan.

- Okay, I...

Where the hell are you going?

To destroy your accelerator,
and I'm gonna enjoy it.

1404

Do you realize
that you have broken every rule?

1405
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,708
You've blown past every conceivable
ethical boundary like it wasn't there.

1406
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:52,125
Yeah? Then why are you here, Dad?

1407
01:16:55,583 --> 01:16:57,666
Because you can't do it without me.

Sorian will simply rebuild it.

- [Louis] What you're after is ISPCA.

Infinitely Shifting
Plasma Containing Algorithm,

1414
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:19,000
which I designed
to stabilize the wormholes.

1415
01:17:19,083 --> 01:17:22,666
That is the mathematical equation
that will make time travel possible.

1416
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:24,250
How do you destroy math?

1417
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:28,708
I've never written the algorithm down
or demonstrated it to another human being,

1418
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:30,708
so it lives here in the old bean,

1419
01:17:30,791 --> 01:17:34,583

in a diamond-hard neuromorphic processor.

Yes. No. Yes.

1423
01:17:39,916 --> 01:17:41,791
- It's a hard drive, okay?
- [chuckles]

1424
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:43,500
- God, you're such a child.
- Sorry.

1425
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:46,666
There is a crystal hard drive
running the algorithm in a closed loop.

1426
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:49,125
That is the nerve center
of the accelerator.

1427
01:17:49,208 --> 01:17:53,458
So we go there, destroy the hard drive,
prevent time travel from being invented.

1428
01:17:53,541 --> 01:17:54,708
Theoretically, time travel...

1429
01:17:54,791 --> 01:17:57,333
Oh my God! You're killing me
with the theoretical.

1430
01:17:57,416 --> 01:17:59,666
- Yes, that should do it.
- Good. Let's do that.

1445
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:10,517
- [Adam] What happens if you pull it out?
- [Louis] One of two things.

1446
01:19:10,541 --> 01:19:13,125
The accelerator will continue to run
on a dormant loop.

1447
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:16,833
But without the algorithm, no one
will ever be able to program it again.

1448
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:18,958
Or?

1449
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:21,666

Love you too.

1722
01:34:07,416 --> 01:34:08,833
[man] So, as I said earlier,

1723
01:34:08,916 --> 01:34:13,000
our goal is to calculate
the variability of gravitational force,

1724
01:34:13,083 --> 01:34:16,250
which depends entirely
on whether your path of motion

1725
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:18,791
is toward the Earth or away from it.

1726
01:34:19,458 --> 01:34:23,083
So let's define the gravitational force
of the Earth on an object

1727
01:34:23,166 --> 01:34:25,875
by Newton's gravitational formula.

1728
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:30,625
F is equal to big G,
Newton's gravitational constant,

1729
01:34:30,708 --> 01:34:33,708
multiplied by m sin 1 times m sin 2

1730
01:34:33,791 --> 01:34:35,500
divided by r squared.

1731
01:34:35,583 --> 01:34:38,833
And m sin 1 is the mass of the Earth,
m sin e,

1732
01:34:39,583 --> 01:34:44,000
m sin 2 is the mass of the object
the Earth is exerting force on.

1733
01:34:44,083 --> 01:34:46,208
- And r...
