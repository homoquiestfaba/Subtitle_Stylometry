2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
On the set of BATTLE ROYALE

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Director Kinji Fukasaku
turns 70 years old.

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Battle Royale is the 60th
film Fukasaku has directed.

5
00:01:11,087 --> 00:01:12,406
OK, one more time.

6
00:01:12,687 --> 00:01:16,475
Kick the second chair over there,
to the left of the window.

7
00:01:20,487 --> 00:01:21,920
Tsukamoto,

8
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,802
look a bit more surprised,

9
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,718
because he’s aiming
the gun at you.

10
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:32,204
There was no tension the second time.

11
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:35,001
Should we shoot the second part?

12
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:39,280
The second part is exactly the same,
as the character's reaction.

13
00:01:40,487 --> 00:01:43,877
If the second part comes in between

14
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:49,283
can we get the cut?
Is there already a difference?

15
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:54,883
It’s about the character's reaction,
not about the chair.

16
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:57,556
It’s got to be snappy...

17
00:01:57,847 --> 00:02:00,281
we see the commotion
and crash, bang...

18
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:05,483
otherwise the cut is wrong.

19
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:07,166
Wait a second...

20
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:09,886
OK, once more!

21
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,082
Here you show no reaction.

22
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:23,076
Only on the other side.

23
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:29,282
Please show me a reaction.

24
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:31,840
OK, from here.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,640
42 ninth-graders must fight
to the death in BATTLE ROYALE.

26
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:30,639
Cut! Put out the fire!

27
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:41,876
Over there are my classmates.

28
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:45,955
I’m in a film with Takeshi Kitano
directed by Fukasaku.

29
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:53,006
Is everything OK?

30
00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:55,482
Sorry... everything’s fine.

31
00:03:57,447 --> 00:03:59,244
Watch out for your elbow...

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,244
Tatsuya Fujiwara
as
Shuya Nanahara

33
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:11,486
What are you doing?!

34
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:21,283
The BATTLE part means
that we’re fighting each other.

35
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:25,401
Like the title says.
But what does the ROYALE mean?

36
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:29,441
How should the audience
understand that at first?

37
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,205
How come you have
so many wounds?

38
00:04:41,487 --> 00:04:44,285
I won the Battle Royale.

39
00:04:45,487 --> 00:04:48,081
The winner is a girl?

40
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:53,923
You all know the BR-Law?

41
00:04:54,887 --> 00:04:57,200
Ai Iwamura
as
last year's winner

42
00:04:58,887 --> 00:05:03,085
We killed our classmates,
until only I survived.

43
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:12,275
Today you will begin
killing each other.

44
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:17,875
Until only one of you survives.
There are no rules.

45
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:20,479
Don’t whisper,
you piece of shit!

46
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:26,479
Aki Maeda
as
Noriko Nakagawa

47
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:30,606
I used to be crazy about horror.

48
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:33,762
Killing each other,
it’s really horrible.

49
00:05:57,087 --> 00:05:59,885
How was it when you turned 15?

50
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:02,281
Oh well...

51
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:09,878
I’ve forgotten.
That was over 50 years ago.

52
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:12,876
Right after the war?
-even before that.

53
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:15,283
Excuse me.
-Yes, after war.

54
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:26,278
What?
-No, nothing.

55
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:34,279
Hello, everyone in Class 9-B
from the Shiroiwa school!

56
00:06:35,887 --> 00:06:40,483
You are the lucky class chosen
for this year's Battle Royale!

57
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,519
Congratulations!

58
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:46,875
You are on a deserted island
that looks like this!

59
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:08,923
Hachijou-kojima

60
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:12,282
Was this island inhabited?
-Yes.

61
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:16,079
People wandered over here,

62
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,281
but they left when there
was a water shortage.

63
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:23,523
Now the goats that they
left behind run wild.

64
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:56,081
That's not where he should be.

65
00:07:56,367 --> 00:08:00,758
His position is farther up.
Ok, now move!

66
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:07,879
Noriko is behind him.

67
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,084
Noriko falls down.

68
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:21,483
Fujiwara notices her,
is surprised... now run!

69
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:28,283
I can’t really see where she fell.

70
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:32,766
Move Noriko's position
3 meters forward!

71
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:36,600
Back, back. 2 meters is better!

72
00:08:36,887 --> 00:08:40,277
Noriko, please stay right there!

73
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:45,678
Please fall again!
Noriko, fall down right there!

74
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:49,084
Is that place OK?

75
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:58,560
Everybody listen!
Please stop fighting!

76
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:00,963
Please hear us out!

77
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:03,400
We found a way out of this,

78
00:09:03,687 --> 00:09:06,804
if we all just meet here!

79
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:10,159
We don’t want to fight!

80
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:12,483
''We are really your friends''...

81
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:15,839
That sounded too much
like normal conversation.

82
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:20,243
''We are really your friends!''

83
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:24,520
Let’s put our head together!
-That was too fast.

84
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:27,442
It’s hard to understand
you from this far away!

85
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:31,242
We are really your friends!
-Even slower!

86
00:09:32,087 --> 00:09:33,281
Friends!

87
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:35,282
More!

88
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:38,365
Let’s try to work together!

89
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:43,282
That last part was too fast.
Give a quiet pause!

90
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:48,682
''Don’t be stupid!
Don’t kill!''

91
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:53,282
''Let’s try to survive together!''

92
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:58,682
Here we are! Please come here!

93
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:01,276
Come over here!

94
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:15,279
It’s getting too late.

95
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:19,000
We’re finished for today.

96
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,476
Mr. Fukasaku seems young.

97
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:26,361
He just strolls up these high mountains.

98
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:30,879
You saw that?
-Ya. I thought, is that him?

99
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:35,360
He’s not sitting under the monitor?

100
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,003
Yukko always had Nanahara...
-No, Yumi!

101
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:52,679
''Please stop!''

102
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:25,964
As I read the script,

103
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,276
I thought, if there was a part,

104
00:11:30,007 --> 00:11:31,998
that fit me, it was Kiriyamas role.

105
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:37,879
In Mr. Fukasaku’s film
it was decided,

106
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:41,284
how many people were
going to be killed.

107
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:52,083
A day before the script was bought,
Mr. Fukasaku suddenly wanted

108
00:11:52,487 --> 00:11:56,480
the main character to brutally
kill a bunch of people.

109
00:11:56,887 --> 00:12:01,802
I knew he was unpredictable
and so I was annoyed.

110
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:05,204
Who should brutally kill people?
Kiriyama? -Yes.

111
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:08,206
He said:
''I like the abnormal.''

112
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:13,084
I think Kiriyama is
fascinated by murder.

113
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:15,676
and enjoys playing the game.

114
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:29,279
What did I do?!

115
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,885
It wouldn’t be right...

116
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:46,798
to tell this story...

117
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:49,078
without showing the violence...

118
00:12:49,887 --> 00:12:51,684
This opinion of censoring violence...

119
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:55,079
I do not agree with such an opinion.

120
00:12:57,487 --> 00:13:01,196
During the student’s movement
we had no weapons.

121
00:13:01,487 --> 00:13:03,682
We were unarmed

122
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:07,960
and helpless when the
police hit us with clubs.

123
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:13,283
In those days,
when the batons came out

124
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:17,282
I thought, ''Shit!''
It was very unfortunate.

125
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:20,281
Why didn't we remember
to bring weapons?

126
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:22,678
It was very regrettable.

127
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,606
Why didn’t we have batons?

128
00:13:26,887 --> 00:13:29,276
''Stop whispering!''

129
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:32,878
Then throw the chalk.

130
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:37,084
Is that okay?
-But we get to choose it.

131
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,284
Is everybody ready?
-Yes.

132
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:45,076
Ready...! And action!

133
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:49,082
This country is at an end!

134
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:53,197
The reason is...
Don’t whisper!

135
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:58,958
The chalk really hit me.

136
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:02,485
He said it was a prop,
but it was real.

137
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:05,082
I could only smile bitterly.

138
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:09,599
An actor must be able to
obey instructions well.

139
00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:12,481
If the director says it’s OK,
it’s OK.

140
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:17,683
An actor must only do,
what he is required to do.

141
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:21,684
The mental part of acting is hard

142
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:23,480
Precise concentration.

143
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:28,079
I act the way I am, because
that’s the way he wants it.

144
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,358
I didn’t understand it at first.

145
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:33,878
But he said,
the teacher has my image,

146
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:38,206
so I try to play it as
naturally as possible.

147
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:39,681
Sit down!

148
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:41,560
I finally died.

149
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:46,443
But it was an honor for me,
because Mr. Kitano killed me.

150
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,398
The island is about
10 square kilometers.

151
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:54,602
Fujiyoshi!

152
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:56,286
Don’t whisper!

153
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:09,278
Move, out of the way...

154
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:17,279
Sorry, it’s against the rules
for me to kill you.

155
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,003
Would I really play the game?

156
00:15:24,287 --> 00:15:26,482
I would probably kill myself.

157
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:30,401
Why? -Because I wouldn’t be
able to kill anyone else.

158
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,401
Osamu Onishi
as
Yoji Kuramoto

159
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:40,559
How should kids act?

160
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:43,441
Nice to others and gut.

161
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:46,481
Also sensible. Normal.

162
00:15:47,087 --> 00:15:50,602
If his friend stepped on an ant,
he should say:

163
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:54,436
''Stop! That’s a living being too.''

164
00:15:57,767 --> 00:16:00,156
Still a little bit lower.

165
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:15,078
The branches are still swinging...
too much movement.

166
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:18,086
Ya... I don’t know...

167
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:22,476
Very difficult... hard...

168
00:16:23,287 --> 00:16:25,596
Whether I’d do it?

169
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:28,401
Some would flee,
others would kill themselves.

170
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,279
I wouldn’t kill myself.

171
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:33,282
I’d look for a way out.

172
00:16:34,887 --> 00:16:36,286
Why did you do that?

173
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:38,886
It’s your fault.

174
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:45,480
You disrespected adults.
You’ll be quiet now.

175
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:49,079
But don’t forget:
Life is a game.

176
00:16:50,287 --> 00:16:54,280
So fight to survive
and find out

177
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:58,281
exactly what you’re worth.

178
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,281
ACTION!

179
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:10,198
A bit open!
The eyes are good.

180
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,198
Ryo Nitta
as
Kyouichi Motobuchi

181
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:23,882
...Square minus 4 ac...

182
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:27,677
You want to fight?
You will see!

183
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:29,639
I’m going to survive!

184
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:35,282
The second face of the
class representative.

185
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:47,318
Since the beginning of the year
I continuously hurt myself.

186
00:17:48,007 --> 00:17:52,523
First I got hit by a car.

187
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:55,678
And after everything healed,

188
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,004
I fell down the steps
at the train station.

189
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:09,004
Shin Kusaka
as
Yoshio Akamatsu

190
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:12,160
I don’t have to roll down anymore...

191
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:17,919
There should be a mat.
-No, there's nothing.

192
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:22,004
So, we’re rolling.

193
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:27,482
And... Action!

194
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:45,485
Let’s do it once more.
It could always be better.

195
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:48,156
Are you okay? - Yes!

196
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,281
Daredevil!

197
00:18:59,527 --> 00:19:02,519
No!
Why are you all like that?!

198
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:07,278
What did I do to you?

199
00:19:08,087 --> 00:19:12,080
Think about it, what did
you all did this whole time?

200
00:19:17,087 --> 00:19:19,681
I always hated you.
I’m gonna kill you!

201
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:26,683
You are all sad that your friends
have died. Heads high!

202
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:38,796
The sound was deafening.
I didn’t want to react,

203
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:40,679
but it was so awful,

204
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:42,958
going off repeatedly in my face.

205
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:46,924
That was not acting,
that was real.

206
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Yutaka Shimada
as
Yutaka Seto

207
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:52,199
Mr. Fukasaku acts so young!

208
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:55,284
He’s still wide awake,
and it’s almost midnight!

209
00:19:55,887 --> 00:19:57,479
My grandmother is already asleep.

210
00:19:57,887 --> 00:19:59,878
Attention! And action...

211
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:06,086
Scornful sneer...

212
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,599
You must exaggerate
and then suddenly stop.

213
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:13,445
Otherwise you miss the effect.

214
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:15,515
Ya, like that...

215
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:18,086
You thought,

216
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:22,675
you good-for-nothing could
join the class trip?

217
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:28,518
That’s a good start.

218
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:33,676
Basically okay.

219
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:36,440
Once more.

220
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:52,367
It really hurt after a while.

221
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:00,886
Kotohiki, is that you?

222
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:05,437
Kotohiki, answer me!

223
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:13,565
Takayo Mimura
as
Kayoko Kotohiki

224
00:21:13,687 --> 00:21:16,565
Let me take it.

225
00:21:17,887 --> 00:21:19,479
Why are you following me?

226
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:21,686
How embarrassing...

227
00:21:22,087 --> 00:21:24,920
Say it already!
-I can’t do that...

228
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:27,198
I have a crush on you.

229
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,281
I have a crush on Kotohiki.

230
00:21:39,487 --> 00:21:41,079
The hanging scene...

231
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:48,079
Tomomi Shimaki
as
Sakura Ogawa

232
00:21:49,087 --> 00:21:51,079
Yauomi Sano
as
Kazuhiko Yamamoto

233
00:21:51,887 --> 00:21:54,685
I don’t want to play the game.

234
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:02,879
No, that that won't work!

235
00:22:07,687 --> 00:22:10,884
At the cut your left foot
must come right here.

236
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:12,802
Yes, like that.

237
00:22:14,687 --> 00:22:17,485
And take the bag
at the right time.

238
00:22:27,687 --> 00:22:29,086
That wasn’t good.

239
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:33,084
I thought it was good.

240
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:36,517
I want to grab it faster.

241
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,005
Fujiwara surprised me.

242
00:23:05,287 --> 00:23:07,847
Me too. The rage he plays
is very cool. I thought,

243
00:23:08,127 --> 00:23:10,243
it was great to look good.

244
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:14,277
But he not only looks good,
he's a good actor too.

245
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,000
He is really good.

246
00:23:16,287 --> 00:23:19,802
I’m bad.
-I don’t think so.

247
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:21,406
I was bad. –When?

248
00:23:21,687 --> 00:23:25,475
When we were in the lighthouse.
-I wasn’t good there either.

249
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:31,285
You act very well,
you have no worries acting.

250
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:33,879
Is this your first leading role?

251
00:23:34,487 --> 00:23:36,603
I’ve acted in too much theater.

252
00:23:36,887 --> 00:23:40,596
If you only do theater,

253
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,003
you tend to overact your
gestures and facial expressions.

254
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:44,886
That’s embarrassing.

255
00:23:46,287 --> 00:23:48,403
When I only show a small reaction,

256
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:53,283
the director says, I should
show more, like Sugimura.

257
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:56,957
Then my reaction is exaggerated.

258
00:23:57,887 --> 00:24:01,197
What should I do,
if everyone says:

259
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:03,682
''Her acting is so corny?''

260
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:07,755
I always tell myself ''So what''
as I watch it.

261
00:24:08,687 --> 00:24:12,885
Watching is easy,
but acting is totally different.

262
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:18,003
''Look, she’s making herself cry''
or something.

263
00:24:18,287 --> 00:24:20,482
Yesterday in a scene,

264
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:23,201
it was really hard for me to cry.

265
00:24:23,487 --> 00:24:26,479
Tears just flow for Kotohiki.
But for me... nothing.

266
00:24:27,687 --> 00:24:30,485
I asked Ando,
how he cries.

267
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:32,758
He said, he doesn’t believe,

268
00:24:33,087 --> 00:24:37,080
that you can just ''act''if
you want to cry convincingly.

269
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:38,681
Really?

270
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:43,085
Some people cry all day,
all the time,

271
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:45,358
while others suppress it.

272
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:48,679
But both types of people
are still sad, right?

273
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:54,205
So you don’t express all of
your sadness when you’re alone.

274
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:58,002
That’s what he said,
and it really touched me.

275
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:02,796
Is this film just between us?

276
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:04,884
But everyone should see it.

277
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:09,604
Really? Is that because
the film is too gruesome?

278
00:25:09,887 --> 00:25:13,436
It would be awful,
if schoolkids copied it,

279
00:25:13,727 --> 00:25:15,126
like, throwing a knife,

280
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:19,281
but everyone should see it.

281
00:25:19,687 --> 00:25:23,282
You’re saying the film is
worth seeing?  -Yes?

282
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:26,764
I like the film, because...

283
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:31,479
besides the fighting...

284
00:25:35,487 --> 00:25:38,285
there’s love...

285
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:41,525
the core feelings
humans can experience.

286
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:45,605
People should relate to the theme
of harassment in the schools

287
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:49,597
because they can imagine
themselves as the victim.

288
00:25:50,487 --> 00:25:51,681
It would be cool,

289
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,676
if the film makes people
look back and reflect on it.

290
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:58,676
We can fight each other,

291
00:26:02,047 --> 00:26:06,006
or we can stop and work together.
I like that about the film.

292
00:26:06,287 --> 00:26:07,879
To die...

293
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:12,365
for the one you love,
transcends age.

294
00:26:12,647 --> 00:26:14,285
Even kids...

295
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:19,516
can express love like that...
wholeheartedly, right?

296
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:20,922
Ya.

297
00:26:21,487 --> 00:26:25,924
Even students can
express mature love.

298
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:31,278
We love each other passionately!

299
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:43,482
We have an ax,

300
00:27:44,487 --> 00:27:48,878
a knife, a gun,
a sword, an icepick...

301
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:08,200
Did you fall in love right away?

302
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:11,286
No, I didn’t.

303
00:28:13,087 --> 00:28:14,281
Or, ya.

304
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:16,806
Yes, you did? -Ya.

305
00:28:17,087 --> 00:28:19,885
How long did it take?
Are you now in love?

306
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:28,445
Is that a serious question?

307
00:28:31,087 --> 00:28:32,406
My dream...

308
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:37,285
is to lead a happy life.

309
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:41,604
I want to have a job that I enjoy,

310
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,685
even if I don’t make much money.

311
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:55,685
I want to concentrate
more on basketball.

312
00:28:57,287 --> 00:28:59,278
I should have gone
to the championship,

313
00:29:00,287 --> 00:29:03,279
but right before the game

314
00:29:03,887 --> 00:29:05,798
I hurt my foot

315
00:29:06,087 --> 00:29:09,284
and I couldn’t play
in the final match.

316
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:13,605
That is too slow...
too slow...

317
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:20,285
Are you in love? –In love?
That’s my little secret.

318
00:29:25,687 --> 00:29:27,882
Is it someone in the cast?

319
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:32,402
I’m not interested in anybody here.

320
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,679
What a shame!
-Or maybe I’m kidding?

321
00:29:39,887 --> 00:29:42,037
Fall the right way,
or we’ll be shooting forever.

322
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:21,080
Good job.
It is now 5 o’clock...

323
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:24,601
We often talk to each other

324
00:30:24,887 --> 00:30:27,401
about what we would all do,

325
00:30:27,687 --> 00:30:31,077
if we had to fight in
this death match for real.

326
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:35,284
I would probably hide.

327
00:30:38,487 --> 00:30:40,478
And shoot anyone!

328
00:30:41,287 --> 00:30:44,484
Anyone who got in the way.
-That’s mean. That would be mean.

329
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:49,875
Anything to survive.
-But that’s definitely a way to do it.

330
00:30:51,087 --> 00:30:54,602
I probably couldn’t save
anyone from being killed.

331
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,366
Not even a friend.

332
00:31:07,287 --> 00:31:09,881
The ''Battle'' begins!

333
00:31:18,087 --> 00:31:20,078
I will avenge Nobu.

334
00:31:22,087 --> 00:31:23,486
Instead of him...

335
00:31:26,087 --> 00:31:30,285
I’ll have to protect you to the end.
-Thank you, Nanahara.

336
00:31:34,687 --> 00:31:37,281
That performance was lifeless,
you two.

337
00:31:37,887 --> 00:31:39,286
Too sentimental.

338
00:31:40,687 --> 00:31:44,282
You shouldn’t show any
feelings at the end.

339
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:46,683
The audience doesn’t feel that.

340
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:52,400
What should we do about the ship?

341
00:31:55,287 --> 00:31:56,879
Let it sink!

342
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,762
The lead part that Tatsuya plays,
is also a person,

343
00:32:04,887 --> 00:32:09,005
who is torn between
justice and friendship

344
00:32:09,287 --> 00:32:11,084
and nothing can be done.

345
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:14,681
I think, in terms of violence...

346
00:32:15,687 --> 00:32:17,803
He’s only hanging around.

347
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:22,077
He doesn’t embody heroism,
like in the novel.

348
00:32:23,687 --> 00:32:25,882
Like a very naïve person

349
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:30,365
he drags himself around against
his own will in such a way

350
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:32,598
and at the end, he asks himself,

351
00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:34,684
why he did it.

352
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,401
We do not find an answer.

353
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:40,598
We leave the question open,

354
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:44,675
about what type of
protagonist Nanahara is.

355
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:54,203
Are you OK?
- Ya. Send Nakagawa over here!

356
00:32:59,287 --> 00:33:01,084
Take care of it yourself.

357
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:10,199
You’ll begin on Mr. Noro’s signal

358
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:12,478
when we do the real take.

359
00:33:33,287 --> 00:33:34,845
Don’t use the big ones.

360
00:33:41,127 --> 00:33:43,322
A Camera... B Camera... ready?

361
00:33:44,087 --> 00:33:47,477
Ready up there?
Then let’s go.

362
00:33:49,887 --> 00:33:51,002
Mark!

363
00:34:04,687 --> 00:34:07,485
Everything’s fine?
-Yes, everything’s OK.

364
00:34:10,287 --> 00:34:13,279
Are camera A and B both OK?
-Ya!

365
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:37,281
What...?

366
00:34:44,927 --> 00:34:46,804
It first came to my attention

367
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:50,682
because I’m the oldest.

368
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:52,679
I decided,

369
00:34:53,487 --> 00:34:57,878
to make a nice circle
and I suggested,

370
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:02,402
that we go to a café
near the studio.

371
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:05,963
But the girls were apprehensive.

372
00:35:07,287 --> 00:35:10,279
So only the guys
ended up in the café.

373
00:35:11,287 --> 00:35:15,280
Later, the girls told me,

374
00:35:15,687 --> 00:35:18,679
that they had thought
I was being a playboy.

375
00:35:19,887 --> 00:35:21,479
What’s that all about?

376
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,081
What, you?

377
00:35:36,687 --> 00:35:38,040
Great big reaction.

378
00:36:08,687 --> 00:36:12,202
That’s great.
-Lots of blood, tons.

379
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:14,523
I was shot 20 or 30 times.

380
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:17,005
Did you die?
-Ya.

381
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:20,006
How many? -About 4 or 5.

382
00:36:20,287 --> 00:36:21,606
4 or 5...

383
00:36:21,887 --> 00:36:23,400
Not many til now.

384
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:33,285
Even the girls are fighting each other.
-Times are changing.

385
00:36:34,687 --> 00:36:37,485
Even the girls are fighting.
- Equal rights.

386
00:36:41,687 --> 00:36:44,679
Even a girl attacked you?
-Ya.

387
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:46,400
And she tried to kill you?
-Ya.

388
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:05,477
I think Mitsuko is strong enough,

389
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:09,043
to fight in the ''Battle Royale''

390
00:37:09,487 --> 00:37:10,681
Who’s there?

391
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:18,682
Ya... It’s OK?

392
00:37:19,647 --> 00:37:22,559
Your weapon.
Was it already used?

393
00:37:29,967 --> 00:37:33,755
Yoshimi and Kuramoto are next door.
They’re both dead.

394
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:37,437
They’re hanging all cozy next
to each other. But not me!

395
00:37:38,287 --> 00:37:40,482
I won't end up like that!

396
00:37:46,487 --> 00:37:47,886
Beautiful day today!

397
00:37:51,487 --> 00:37:53,478
The color won’t go away.

398
00:37:55,287 --> 00:37:58,279
I’ve already betrayed my friends.
-How come?

399
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,159
It’s a secret.
-A secret?

400
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,886
Yup, my secret.

401
00:38:05,287 --> 00:38:07,482
I’ll only take so much bullying.

402
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:12,484
Really? -Ya.

403
00:38:13,407 --> 00:38:15,875
I didn’t see the scene.

404
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:18,681
Can you tell me what happened?

405
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:21,885
I was threatened with a knife

406
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:26,763
and ran away.
But Chigusa ran after me.

407
00:38:27,047 --> 00:38:30,005
And then something awful happened?
-Ya.

408
00:38:30,287 --> 00:38:34,200
I was stabbed here twice,
and also twice here.

409
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,082
Wait, should she grab here?

410
00:38:55,687 --> 00:38:58,281
Show me a new Chiaki Kuriyama.

411
00:38:58,687 --> 00:39:01,884
Ya, do it like that.

412
00:39:12,287 --> 00:39:16,599
Just a close-up of the knife?
-No, the whole thing is good.

413
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,479
I agree.

414
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:37,757
Always blaming someone else!

415
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,079
That's why I hate your guts.

416
00:39:50,887 --> 00:39:54,482
I'll resist you
with my whole body!

417
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:57,802
What if this was real?

418
00:39:58,087 --> 00:39:59,486
I think,

419
00:40:00,287 --> 00:40:04,678
I’d be scared and hide.

420
00:40:05,687 --> 00:40:09,282
I wouldn’t know if
I could trust my friends

421
00:40:11,087 --> 00:40:13,078
or whether I would stay
together with them.

422
00:40:15,687 --> 00:40:18,076
I would stay by myself.

423
00:40:19,687 --> 00:40:21,678
It’s easier to be alone.

424
00:40:42,687 --> 00:40:44,040
Is that on?

425
00:40:44,327 --> 00:40:45,999
An interview ...

426
00:40:46,287 --> 00:40:49,279
Why do you think Kawada
can kill so many people?

427
00:40:50,287 --> 00:40:54,883
Good question... I don’t kill
senselessly. I’m defending myself.

428
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:58,762
Oh ya, sure, whatever.
-It’s self-defense.

429
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:03,086
Besides, why did you kill?
I didn’t kill anyone.

430
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:06,721
I didn’t have to murder.

431
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:08,599
I didn’t kill anyone.

432
00:41:08,887 --> 00:41:12,004
I didn’t have a weapon
-What’s your weapon?

433
00:41:12,287 --> 00:41:14,596
What’s your weapon?
-A gun.

434
00:41:14,887 --> 00:41:17,401
Mine’s poison.
-Oh, so you’re the one...

435
00:41:17,687 --> 00:41:19,279
the mass murderer!

436
00:41:20,287 --> 00:41:23,279
I’m innocent!
-Guilty!

437
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:28,085
What did you do?
-I only cooked the stew.

438
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:33,080
How terrible. And you?
-I did the dishes.

439
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:38,686
What’s wrong?

440
00:41:43,887 --> 00:41:46,003
Who, who was it?
-Satomi, no!

441
00:41:46,287 --> 00:41:49,359
We're the only ones here! Chisato!
you cooked it, right?! -Haruka too!

442
00:41:49,647 --> 00:41:51,956
You think I killed her?!

443
00:41:52,247 --> 00:41:55,159
Cut it out!
Satomi, lower that gun!

444
00:41:56,487 --> 00:41:58,000
You're suspicious yourself!

445
00:41:59,087 --> 00:42:00,406
Haruka!

446
00:42:01,967 --> 00:42:05,084
You didn't sleep at all the
last 2 nights, did you?

447
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:09,599
It just means you don't trust us
-I forgot my sleeping pills...

448
00:42:09,887 --> 00:42:13,277
Insomina at your age?! -Cut it out!
Satomi, lower that gun!

449
00:42:14,687 --> 00:42:16,882
''Shut the fuck up!'' Bang!

450
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,278
''Shut the fuck up!''

451
00:42:47,567 --> 00:42:49,159
Shut the fuck up!

452
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:01,561
Sorry...

453
00:43:15,687 --> 00:43:19,680
Even if the soup sprays you,
stay in character!

454
00:43:22,287 --> 00:43:25,085
Shut the fuck up!
Cut the leadership crap!

455
00:43:25,487 --> 00:43:28,797
Chisato...
-You screwed up the poisoning!

456
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:30,805
How can you say that?!

457
00:43:31,087 --> 00:43:34,477
You schemed with Nanahara
to escape together!

458
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,881
Hold it higher.
Once more!

459
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:51,355
Not like that... Like this!

460
00:43:52,487 --> 00:43:55,285
I hope you can do it.

461
00:43:57,287 --> 00:44:00,279
Shut up! Cut the leadership crap!
Chisato...

462
00:44:00,687 --> 00:44:04,600
You screwed up the poisoning!
-How can you say that?!

463
00:44:04,887 --> 00:44:08,197
You schemed with Nanahara
to escape together!

464
00:44:08,487 --> 00:44:11,081
Sayaka Kamiya
as
Satomi Noda

465
00:44:11,887 --> 00:44:13,206
Excuse me.

466
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:16,365
Was it you?
-''Was it you?!''

467
00:44:20,847 --> 00:44:22,997
Ya, like that.

468
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:27,519
Can you remember to hold it
like that... along this line?

469
00:44:27,807 --> 00:44:30,605
I think it’s stupid to
betray your friends.

470
00:44:30,887 --> 00:44:34,277
I would run away.
I couldn’t kill anyone.

471
00:44:34,567 --> 00:44:37,161
In reality it’d be different.
-She’d really kill.

472
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:41,001
In this situation...

473
00:44:41,287 --> 00:44:43,084
I’d save myself first.

474
00:44:43,367 --> 00:44:46,359
I think there isn’t a choice.

475
00:44:46,647 --> 00:44:49,798
I would figure out how to react

476
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:52,043
and if I needed to be deceptive.

477
00:44:52,687 --> 00:44:54,757
You schemed with Nanahara
to escape together!

478
00:45:04,487 --> 00:45:05,681
Thanks.

479
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,884
Attention everybody, stay there!
We’re gonna take a photo!

480
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:14,601
The ninth grade

481
00:45:14,887 --> 00:45:18,675
has a special meaning for me.

482
00:45:19,087 --> 00:45:23,285
The war in the pacific ended
with the surrender of Japan,

483
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:26,081
when I was in the ninth grade.

484
00:45:26,367 --> 00:45:31,361
About a month before
the end of the war

485
00:45:32,087 --> 00:45:35,397
the US troops started bombing us.

486
00:45:35,887 --> 00:45:40,085
It was hopeless to run away or hide.
It was all around us.

487
00:45:40,687 --> 00:45:44,157
We were all turned around...

488
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:46,798
About thirty people

489
00:45:47,087 --> 00:45:48,998
were killed.

490
00:45:50,407 --> 00:45:51,840
The dispossal

491
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:56,086
of the corpses was assigned us,
the ninth graders.

492
00:45:56,487 --> 00:46:00,082
We had to collect the
dismembered limbs.

493
00:46:00,887 --> 00:46:02,479
Only one will survive.

494
00:46:02,967 --> 00:46:06,676
During every air raid,
every bombing,

495
00:46:07,087 --> 00:46:11,285
we sought shelter under
our friends’ bodys.

496
00:46:13,407 --> 00:46:16,399
I thought it was better to die,

497
00:46:16,687 --> 00:46:20,680
than to always live in fear,

498
00:46:22,087 --> 00:46:27,081
but when the time came,
I’d hide myself again.

499
00:46:28,687 --> 00:46:33,283
When it was all over,
we didn’t feel shame

500
00:46:33,687 --> 00:46:36,406
but we were silent

501
00:46:36,687 --> 00:46:39,485
and we’d lick our wounds.

502
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:42,239
Today I would like...

503
00:46:44,287 --> 00:46:46,881
Ouch! It hurts...!

504
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:49,476
I'm bleeding, dammit!

505
00:46:51,727 --> 00:46:53,604
Look who's talking?!

506
00:46:53,887 --> 00:46:57,004
Shut the fuck up!
You tried to steal the gun,

507
00:46:57,287 --> 00:47:01,075
so you're guilty!
Take this!

508
00:47:06,287 --> 00:47:09,085
Once more.
-There are no rules.

509
00:47:12,087 --> 00:47:13,315
What’s so funny?

510
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,681
''Hey, what’s going on, lzumi?''

511
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:42,079
''Open the door!''

512
00:47:53,487 --> 00:47:57,082
I can’t take any more.
I probably pulled a muscle.

513
00:47:59,127 --> 00:48:00,845
15 years old, Summer

514
00:48:05,807 --> 00:48:08,526
The battle continues

515
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:13,280
Some people protect,
others murder.

516
00:48:13,887 --> 00:48:17,277
Some kill themselves.

517
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:23,283
Nanahara lets the others
kill themselves.

518
00:48:46,887 --> 00:48:49,685
It was an interesting
Century for me.

519
00:48:49,967 --> 00:48:53,880
Thinking back to the end of the
war, it would be interesting,

520
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:57,477
if everything was burned up
and the Earth was totally flattened.

521
00:48:57,767 --> 00:49:00,884
That would be interesting.

522
00:50:27,327 --> 00:50:33,082
Takeshi Kitano
as ''Teacher Kitano''

523
00:50:34,327 --> 00:50:39,082
What’s the main reason
you are in this film?

524
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:44,282
The producer came to me and said,
the teacher is just like me.

525
00:50:44,687 --> 00:50:47,884
I said, he’s like ME?

526
00:50:48,247 --> 00:50:50,886
The director is Fukasaku.

527
00:50:51,687 --> 00:50:56,283
And when he asked me,
I really wanted to be in his film.

528
00:50:58,887 --> 00:51:02,675
Then I found out that the
teacher’s name was ''Kitano''

529
00:51:02,967 --> 00:51:04,878
That was a shock to me.

530
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:09,080
I not only had the role,
but I was playing myself.

531
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:14,077
What was the intention of the director,
to let you play yourself?

532
00:51:14,367 --> 00:51:17,996
Even the written symbol was the same.
-The Kanji character?

533
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:21,404
Ya. The teacher shared my identity!

534
00:51:21,687 --> 00:51:25,282
Even the foreign spelling
was the same way I spell it.

535
00:51:25,887 --> 00:51:28,082
So it really meant
I was playing myself.

536
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:34,480
Still, Fukasaku gave me very detailed
directions about the character.

537
00:51:35,487 --> 00:51:39,480
Ya, in that last short scene
he gave you so many instructions.

538
00:51:40,287 --> 00:51:42,801
He’s definitely the most energetic.
-Ya, really.

539
00:51:43,087 --> 00:51:46,602
All the others drop from exhaustion.
But not Fukasaku.

540
00:51:46,887 --> 00:51:49,003
Everyone else is tired, but he’s fit,

541
00:51:49,287 --> 00:51:51,881
even though he’s the oldest.
-Ya, exactly.

542
00:51:52,167 --> 00:51:55,398
I think it’s his passion.

543
00:51:55,687 --> 00:51:58,997
His feeling for the film.
Everyone’s in awe of him.

544
00:51:59,887 --> 00:52:01,479
Really it’s just an image.

545
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:04,679
I play up my image,

546
00:52:05,487 --> 00:52:08,285
that I’ve created
through film and TV.

547
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:12,079
But that’s not how I really am.

548
00:52:12,487 --> 00:52:14,079
I thought,

549
00:52:14,367 --> 00:52:17,165
I should act like I normally do.

550
00:52:18,087 --> 00:52:22,603
Since he rarely objects,
I’d probably be OK with that.

551
00:52:22,887 --> 00:52:27,642
Compared to the character in the novel,
you play the teacher very seriously.

552
00:52:27,927 --> 00:52:29,724
How should I explain it...

553
00:52:30,487 --> 00:52:32,682
He wanted me to play it this way.

554
00:52:32,967 --> 00:52:34,161
Oh, ya?

555
00:52:34,447 --> 00:52:38,599
Ya. Trying it out during
rehearsals we had different takes.

556
00:52:38,887 --> 00:52:42,277
He’d say: ''Do it like this'',
I’d think, OK.

557
00:52:43,887 --> 00:52:46,799
There’s also a funny side to you,

558
00:52:47,087 --> 00:52:50,284
the comic ''Beat'' Takeshi?

559
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,877
During a scene,
he’d look at the monitor,

560
00:52:54,687 --> 00:52:57,485
and ask me,
how I should act.

561
00:52:57,767 --> 00:53:00,884
I’d die laughing. But not
at the beginning of the film.

562
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:05,877
What do you think, as a director,
about the themes of violence and death?

563
00:53:14,087 --> 00:53:15,486
The meaning of the film...

564
00:53:16,687 --> 00:53:18,279
But I'm just an actor in this film.

565
00:53:18,887 --> 00:53:22,596
I won’t try to explain the meaning...

566
00:53:22,887 --> 00:53:25,879
or think about the production.

567
00:53:26,887 --> 00:53:30,596
I don’t want to interfere
with the director.

568
00:53:30,887 --> 00:53:33,879
''Shouldn’t that come earlier?''
That would be rude.

569
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:36,283
I act like he says.

570
00:53:37,287 --> 00:53:40,199
I only grasp the general
meaning of the film.

571
00:53:40,487 --> 00:53:42,478
I don’t think about the big picture.

572
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:49,205
In one scene you throw
chalk at the students,

573
00:53:49,487 --> 00:53:52,604
and then a knife,
killing a student.

574
00:53:52,887 --> 00:53:55,879
Did you act heartlessly?

575
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,684
The teacher loses it gradually.

576
00:54:01,287 --> 00:54:04,677
In the beginning, only the
students are out of control

577
00:54:04,967 --> 00:54:09,483
and the teacher endures
them with firm patience.

578
00:54:09,767 --> 00:54:12,076
But under certain circumstances

579
00:54:12,367 --> 00:54:15,598
even the adults get pissed off.

580
00:54:15,887 --> 00:54:20,403
I think that’s how it
is in this film.

581
00:54:20,687 --> 00:54:25,681
When something like that happens,
then adults get cruel.

582
00:54:27,047 --> 00:54:31,802
Now about Teacher Kitano

583
00:54:32,487 --> 00:54:34,796
Yesterday, I acted
like I was stabbed

584
00:54:35,087 --> 00:54:37,885
by a poor kid with a knife.

585
00:54:38,287 --> 00:54:41,677
This makes the teacher
a multi-faceted character.

586
00:54:42,887 --> 00:54:44,286
Yes, indeed...

587
00:54:45,087 --> 00:54:48,397
A man, who is dangerous and
lovable at the same time.

588
00:54:48,687 --> 00:54:51,406
The scene in the river
bed is a good example.

589
00:54:51,687 --> 00:54:53,678
Yes that scene...

590
00:54:54,487 --> 00:54:58,878
Here he dreams about,
how it should be. The ideal.

591
00:55:00,087 --> 00:55:01,486
Ya.

592
00:55:03,087 --> 00:55:07,478
Basically...
the teacher is always like that.

593
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:12,278
Whether it’s then or now.
Even this teacher is that way.

594
00:55:13,487 --> 00:55:15,876
Internally, he’s always thinking
about his students.

595
00:55:16,887 --> 00:55:18,878
And I believe...

596
00:55:19,287 --> 00:55:24,077
He breaks out of
that unintentionally.

597
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:27,206
That’s how I fell.

598
00:55:28,527 --> 00:55:33,282
How was it, when
you were 15 years old?

599
00:55:34,287 --> 00:55:39,202
From second to sixth grade,

600
00:55:39,487 --> 00:55:41,876
I always had the same teacher.

601
00:55:42,487 --> 00:55:44,079
Her name was Mrs. Fujisaki

602
00:55:44,887 --> 00:55:47,082
and I was totally in love with her.

603
00:55:48,487 --> 00:55:49,886
And then...

604
00:55:53,487 --> 00:55:57,275
by the ninth grade, I didn’t
care about school any more.

605
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:00,082
It meant a lot to me...

606
00:56:01,287 --> 00:56:03,482
that the school system...

607
00:56:05,287 --> 00:56:08,597
was closed.
School should be a place,

608
00:56:08,887 --> 00:56:12,482
where students can study safely.

609
00:56:13,487 --> 00:56:16,399
Talented students were
especially supported,

610
00:56:16,687 --> 00:56:19,485
and the rest of the
students were troublemakers.

611
00:56:19,887 --> 00:56:23,880
A smart group
and a stupid group.

612
00:56:24,287 --> 00:56:27,484
I was in the stupid group
and made trouble for the teachers.

613
00:56:28,487 --> 00:56:30,876
But in my opinion...

614
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:33,476
it’s worse today than
it was back then.

615
00:56:35,287 --> 00:56:39,883
Back then, there were 60 students
in a middleschool class.

616
00:56:40,687 --> 00:56:42,678
16 classes with 1000 students.

617
00:56:43,287 --> 00:56:44,686
Ya, that’s right!

618
00:56:44,967 --> 00:56:47,356
That was the era of
the baby boomers.

619
00:56:48,487 --> 00:56:49,886
After every exam...

620
00:56:51,487 --> 00:56:55,480
they’d hang up the names
of over 900 students.

621
00:56:55,887 --> 00:56:58,481
The best and worst scores
were always the same.

622
00:56:58,887 --> 00:57:02,277
The best student went on to
the University of Tokyo,

623
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:06,479
the most renowned in Japan.

624
00:57:06,767 --> 00:57:11,283
The worst student, the crazy idiot,
is in a nut house these days

625
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:13,684
and not still in school.

626
00:57:15,287 --> 00:57:17,005
So altogether about 1000 students?

627
00:57:17,287 --> 00:57:20,677
The worst were pure evil.

628
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:24,677
Sometimes even Yakuza bosses.
There was everything.

629
00:57:26,287 --> 00:57:30,200
There was a difference,
but also much more energy.

630
00:57:30,487 --> 00:57:33,797
Back then the teachers didn’t
know all of the students.

631
00:57:34,087 --> 00:57:37,397
I’m often visited by old classmates

632
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:40,963
and if I ask which class,
they’ll say, ''class 15''.

633
00:57:41,247 --> 00:57:43,886
I don’t him,
I was in class 2.

634
00:57:45,287 --> 00:57:48,279
We only remember the
best and the worst.

635
00:57:48,687 --> 00:57:52,680
''If we’re struck by a former student,
then we will show them more affection.''

636
00:57:52,967 --> 00:57:56,676
Do you build you performance
upon your own experiences?

637
00:57:57,887 --> 00:58:00,276
Ya... back then, violence was...

638
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:03,679
a kind of connection...

639
00:58:04,287 --> 00:58:06,278
or communication, you know?

640
00:58:06,887 --> 00:58:10,675
Nowadays violence is only
punishing the body. And so...

641
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:15,685
The teacher gave the kids
a slap on the head

642
00:58:16,487 --> 00:58:19,684
in order to communicate a point.
Not as punishment.

643
00:58:20,087 --> 00:58:22,203
That’s the big difference.

644
00:58:22,527 --> 00:58:27,203
But the worst are people,
who just watch violence.

645
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:31,677
Ya, passive viewers,

646
00:58:32,087 --> 00:58:34,476
who watch objectively from above,

647
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:36,878
you know, really watch,

648
00:58:37,287 --> 00:58:40,279
they’re the most powerful.

649
00:58:41,487 --> 00:58:44,081
They commit the strongest violence.

650
00:58:45,087 --> 00:58:48,284
Violence is always there anyway.

651
00:58:48,887 --> 00:58:52,197
You hit or you don’t.
But just watching is dangerous.

652
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:53,886
Those who let others hit.

653
00:58:55,727 --> 00:59:00,437
Were you trying to be funny
when you fell in the water?

654
00:59:02,087 --> 00:59:06,285
Sure... I meant to fall down there.

655
00:59:06,687 --> 00:59:09,281
Slip or what?
-And fall.

656
00:59:10,487 --> 00:59:13,081
That will probably be cut out.
-Probably.

657
00:59:14,607 --> 00:59:19,283
How was it to work with
another generation?

658
00:59:19,687 --> 00:59:24,283
Oh... actually the students
and I are together over here,

659
00:59:24,887 --> 00:59:27,481
and the director is up here.

660
00:59:29,487 --> 00:59:31,478
I only act according to
his direction.

661
00:59:32,287 --> 00:59:34,676
It’s really hard for
the students though.

662
00:59:35,487 --> 00:59:38,285
They’re getting a lot of
instructions, every time.

663
00:59:39,287 --> 00:59:42,677
Also the long rehearsals...

664
00:59:44,087 --> 00:59:46,647
But that is the world
of the director Fukasaku.

665
00:59:46,927 --> 00:59:51,637
What is your impression
Fukasaku as a director?

666
00:59:51,927 --> 00:59:53,406
The energy.

667
00:59:53,687 --> 00:59:57,999
He has more energy than me,
even though he’s older.

668
00:59:58,287 --> 00:59:59,879
Also his pacing.

669
01:00:00,167 --> 01:00:04,160
I make pauses twice as long
as he does between lines.

670
01:00:04,687 --> 01:00:08,680
He often said: ''Mr. Takeshi,
please act twice as fast.''

671
01:00:08,967 --> 01:00:13,358
I think his perception of time
is twice as fast as mine.

672
01:00:15,687 --> 01:00:19,077
I had to make the pauses between
sentences extremely short.

673
01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:22,276
It was almost impossible,

674
01:00:22,887 --> 01:00:27,085
to act slowly and methodically.

675
01:00:27,487 --> 01:00:31,605
All of his films are like that.
His rhythm is faster.

676
01:00:31,887 --> 01:00:34,082
Always more text in less time.

677
01:00:34,887 --> 01:00:39,483
I take a lot of time,
sometimes even too much.

678
01:00:40,687 --> 01:00:42,598
There are different
points of view.

679
01:00:42,887 --> 01:00:45,401
I don’t know,
whose idea it was,

680
01:00:45,687 --> 01:00:48,281
to give the director a monitor.

681
01:00:49,287 --> 01:00:53,075
Now he sees it in the monitor
instead of through the camera.

682
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:56,799
Before he’d only see the picture
and say OK.

683
01:00:57,087 --> 01:01:01,285
But now he can pays attention to
the tiniest little things.

684
01:01:01,687 --> 01:01:04,599
He watches the actors,

685
01:01:04,887 --> 01:01:07,879
the moment they aren’t speaking.

686
01:01:08,687 --> 01:01:12,077
Then he’d say:
''Why are you making that face?''

687
01:01:12,367 --> 01:01:15,996
Or: ''Go over there...''
He is now very precise.

688
01:01:16,287 --> 01:01:20,485
My cameraman will soon be
working with Fukasaku.

689
01:01:21,487 --> 01:01:25,002
I asked him, why he brought that stand.
For the monitor, he says.

690
01:01:25,287 --> 01:01:27,881
I say: ''Then it takes longer.''
And it does.

691
01:01:29,487 --> 01:01:33,685
On a shoot with 40 people,
I’ve already lost interest.

692
01:01:34,487 --> 01:01:37,797
I say, if it’s not in the picture,
then it’s not important.

693
01:01:38,087 --> 01:01:39,998
But not everyone agrees.

694
01:01:40,287 --> 01:01:44,485
Kurosawa and other directors
all did it the same way.

695
01:01:45,287 --> 01:01:47,278
They are insanely precise.

696
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:51,348
Press Conference

697
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:05,552
Welcome to this press conference.

698
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:09,228
Filming began on July 20.

699
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:12,954
The production has gone
very well so far,

700
01:02:13,238 --> 01:02:17,356
and shooting is scheduled to be
completed by the end of August.

701
01:02:17,638 --> 01:02:20,755
We will be in Warsaw Poland
on October 4th, 5th, and 6th,

702
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:24,030
to record the film score

703
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:27,708
with the Warsaw Philharmonic.
On October 29 the film will be finished.

704
01:02:27,998 --> 01:02:32,628
We are happy that the
production company,

705
01:02:32,918 --> 01:02:37,150
and the studio could arrange
this press conference.

706
01:02:37,438 --> 01:02:40,794
Thank you for your patience...
Now let’s invite the cast and crew

707
01:02:41,078 --> 01:02:43,433
of Battle Royale to please join us.

708
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:45,829
Please come on in!

709
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:50,631
Coming in first, is the director,
Mr. Fukasaku. Many thanks.

710
01:02:59,038 --> 01:03:02,826
Followed by the actors
and the author of the novel.

711
01:03:03,438 --> 01:03:06,350
They’re all here so you
can take your photos now.

712
01:03:06,638 --> 01:03:10,426
The film BATTLE ROYALE
from Toei, Amu Associates,

713
01:03:10,718 --> 01:03:14,154
Kobi, Nihon Shuppan Hanbai,

714
01:03:14,438 --> 01:03:17,430
Wow Wow and
Gyaga Communications

715
01:03:17,718 --> 01:03:22,348
is a joint production
of these seven companies.

716
01:03:22,638 --> 01:03:25,948
Let’s first talk to the author,
Koshun Takami, about the original novel.

717
01:03:26,238 --> 01:03:30,550
The book was a bestseller.
It sold over 300,000 copies,

718
01:03:30,838 --> 01:03:34,956
and it sparked a lot of
controversy. Welcome Mr.Takami.

719
01:03:35,238 --> 01:03:38,036
I’m really a first-time writer.

720
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:44,548
It’s bit surreal to be sitting
on a panel next to Mr. Fukasaku

721
01:03:44,838 --> 01:03:49,628
and these famous stars.
It truly is unreal.

722
01:03:52,638 --> 01:03:54,151
I’m thankful,

723
01:03:54,438 --> 01:03:57,953
to work with them on this film.

724
01:03:58,238 --> 01:04:02,231
Thank you all for being here today.

725
01:04:04,518 --> 01:04:07,351
The director is Mr. Fukasaku,

726
01:04:07,638 --> 01:04:12,234
an icon of Japanese film.
This is his sixtieth film.

727
01:04:12,518 --> 01:04:14,315
Welcome Mr. Fukasaku.

728
01:04:18,238 --> 01:04:22,197
Thank you all for coming today,
despite this terrible heat.

729
01:04:23,438 --> 01:04:25,952
''You can’t turn back time.''

730
01:04:26,358 --> 01:04:28,952
This is my guiding philosophy.

731
01:04:29,238 --> 01:04:33,436
Sometimes I think to myself:
'' Don’t think about your age!''

732
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:39,634
Oh well... recently,

733
01:04:40,038 --> 01:04:43,030
I have been thinking
about my own life.

734
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:47,831
When I read this book,

735
01:04:48,238 --> 01:04:53,028
that deals with 42 students
murdering each other,

736
01:04:53,438 --> 01:04:57,226
it was really quite a shock.

737
01:04:58,038 --> 01:05:02,828
These kids lives were very similar,
and yet so different...

738
01:05:03,238 --> 01:05:07,834
to my own personal experiences,

739
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:11,230
as a student during the war.

740
01:05:11,638 --> 01:05:15,233
My experiences and the book
came together like that.

741
01:05:16,638 --> 01:05:19,027
I knew I had to make
the book into a film.

742
01:05:21,238 --> 01:05:24,435
Still my own experiences
are quite different from those

743
01:05:26,038 --> 01:05:27,630
of these young actors,

744
01:05:28,038 --> 01:05:32,031
and we had to communicate
those differences to each other...

745
01:05:33,238 --> 01:05:36,036
That was something I
always had to consider.

746
01:05:37,438 --> 01:05:39,429
I must admit,

747
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:43,035
they acted wonderfully.

748
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:46,310
I think it’s interesting

749
01:05:50,038 --> 01:05:52,154
that Mr. Takeshi and I

750
01:05:52,438 --> 01:05:55,635
almost crossed career paths
ten years ago.

751
01:06:00,638 --> 01:06:04,836
I regret that we wasted
so much time between then and now.

752
01:06:05,438 --> 01:06:09,556
But I’m glad that
we finally met again

753
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:13,831
and that this time we were able
to work together. Thanks.

754
01:06:17,238 --> 01:06:19,547
Thank you very much.
That was Mr. Fukasaku.

755
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:23,547
He was supposed to direct the film
''Violent Cop'' ten years ago,

756
01:06:23,838 --> 01:06:26,955
but he fell ill so the film’s star,
Takeshi Kitano, directed it instead.

757
01:06:27,238 --> 01:06:29,957
Mr. Fukasaku said from then on,

758
01:06:30,238 --> 01:06:33,833
they were both very determined
to work together on a film

759
01:06:34,238 --> 01:06:37,036
and this was their first chance.

760
01:06:37,438 --> 01:06:41,226
Let’s now pass the microphone
to the actor Tatsuya Fujiwara

761
01:06:41,638 --> 01:06:46,348
who played the character Shuya
Nanahara without a stuntman!

762
01:06:46,638 --> 01:06:50,631
I cried the first time
I read the book.

763
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:54,227
And I cried again,

764
01:06:54,638 --> 01:06:56,833
when I read the script.

765
01:06:57,118 --> 01:06:59,074
It’s just so emotionally moving.

766
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:02,555
I hope a lot of people
will go see the film.

767
01:07:03,438 --> 01:07:07,750
I hope every Japanese person
gets a chance to see it.

768
01:07:08,038 --> 01:07:09,835
I think,

769
01:07:10,118 --> 01:07:13,554
this team of filmmakers was
so enthusiastic and devoted.

770
01:07:13,838 --> 01:07:17,831
My impression of the director,
Mr. Fukasaku, is...

771
01:07:18,918 --> 01:07:22,149
He’s more lively than us
and he has so much energy.

772
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:25,828
His energy rubs off on us.

773
01:07:26,118 --> 01:07:30,634
If we were dead tired,
his vigor would wake us up.

774
01:07:30,918 --> 01:07:33,432
During breaks between shots,
I’d feel tired,

775
01:07:33,718 --> 01:07:36,107
but I’d look over at the director...

776
01:07:36,398 --> 01:07:39,356
and his energy would jumpstart me.

777
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:42,914
That kept me going
until the next morning.

778
01:07:43,198 --> 01:07:46,747
Miss Aki Maeda
plays Noriko Nakagawa,

779
01:07:47,038 --> 01:07:49,552
who is secretly in love
with Fujiwara.

780
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:53,228
I play Noriko Nakagawa.

781
01:07:55,038 --> 01:07:59,031
She’s a stubborn girl,
who always goes against the flow.

782
01:08:00,238 --> 01:08:02,035
She has her own set of values.

783
01:08:03,238 --> 01:08:05,229
As the story plays out...

784
01:08:05,518 --> 01:08:08,430
her friends have
all killed each other,

785
01:08:09,438 --> 01:08:11,633
and none of the other students know

786
01:08:14,638 --> 01:08:17,027
if they can depend on each other.

787
01:08:18,838 --> 01:08:20,829
She’s scared of being alone,

788
01:08:21,638 --> 01:08:25,028
but she doesn’t trust anyone else.

789
01:08:25,638 --> 01:08:27,435
In this situation...

790
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:32,826
she can only believe in the boy
that she has a crush on.

791
01:08:34,438 --> 01:08:36,747
She does things her own way.

792
01:08:37,038 --> 01:08:40,235
I think she’s a very strong girl.

793
01:08:42,438 --> 01:08:43,837
Director Fukasaku

794
01:08:44,638 --> 01:08:46,151
was always wide awake,

795
01:08:46,438 --> 01:08:50,033
even though we shot
all day, every day.

796
01:08:51,038 --> 01:08:53,029
Since I arrived on the set,

797
01:08:54,038 --> 01:08:57,633
I could feel his energy
boost me up. Thank you.

798
01:09:00,998 --> 01:09:04,035
And now Taro Yamamoto,
who plays Shugo Kawada.

799
01:09:04,318 --> 01:09:06,752
Thanks. I’m Taro Yamamoto.

800
01:09:07,038 --> 01:09:09,552
When I first went to the audition,

801
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:13,148
I heard that the lead role
was a ninth-grader.

802
01:09:13,438 --> 01:09:15,235
So I thought,

803
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:18,715
I’d be playing a
PE teacher or something.

804
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,433
But then they asked me,

805
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:26,754
to read for the part of the ninth-grader.
I thought, this is crazy.

806
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:31,156
But I did it anyway, and I figured: ''There’s no way I'll get this part.''

807
01:09:31,438 --> 01:09:35,750
During the audition,
we rehearsed the different lines

808
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:40,634
and the director had already
given detailed instructions

809
01:09:40,918 --> 01:09:44,354
about how we should act
even during the audition.

810
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:47,948
I thought the audition went pretty well
but I didn’t expect much.

811
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:51,753
They told us they’d decide that night,

812
01:09:52,038 --> 01:09:55,633
and we’d find out the next day
if we got the part or not.

813
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:00,436
But a few weeks passed before
I found out that I got the role

814
01:10:01,038 --> 01:10:03,757
of a ninth-grader even though
I was already 25 years old.

815
01:10:04,038 --> 01:10:06,996
I thought, Fukasaku must be crazy.

816
01:10:07,678 --> 01:10:09,031
Sorry about that...

817
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:12,228
What really inspired me though,

818
01:10:12,518 --> 01:10:16,110
Fukasaku was using a cane
at the time of the audition.

819
01:10:16,638 --> 01:10:18,833
And when rehearsals started,

820
01:10:19,638 --> 01:10:22,027
he still had the cane,

821
01:10:22,638 --> 01:10:26,950
but at some point,
he just dropped the cane

822
01:10:27,238 --> 01:10:31,516
and started running around.
He could run so fast,

823
01:10:31,798 --> 01:10:33,356
and I thought, is he crazy?

824
01:10:33,638 --> 01:10:37,153
I’d see that and think,
something’s gotten into him.

825
01:10:37,438 --> 01:10:40,555
Even though he’s 70 years old,

826
01:10:40,838 --> 01:10:43,432
he still works so passionately.

827
01:10:44,038 --> 01:10:47,713
I’d love to be like him.
I really mean that!

828
01:10:47,998 --> 01:10:51,229
Next is Masanobu Ando,
who plays Kazuo Kiriyama.

829
01:10:51,518 --> 01:10:55,511
This time I was playing a
character that was even younger
than my very first role,

830
01:10:56,038 --> 01:10:58,427
so I was a bit hesitant...

831
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:02,433
But I accepted the part anyway.

832
01:11:05,638 --> 01:11:08,948
I realized, it was probably the
first and only chance I’d get

833
01:11:09,238 --> 01:11:13,231
to wear a school uniform in a film.
And I figured I’d enjoy it.

834
01:11:14,638 --> 01:11:17,630
I think there’s something beautiful
about being able to live

835
01:11:18,438 --> 01:11:20,030
and do whatever you want.

836
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:23,515
Ya, really, it’s not so bad to be older.

837
01:11:25,398 --> 01:11:28,435
And finally let’s greet
Takeshi ''Beat'' Kitano,

838
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:32,427
who plays a teacher,
also named ''Kitano''.

839
01:11:32,718 --> 01:11:36,427
He makes the 42 students
kill each other.

840
01:11:39,638 --> 01:11:40,832
Good afternoon.

841
01:11:42,638 --> 01:11:45,550
The title of the film is
BATTLE ROYALE

842
01:11:45,838 --> 01:11:47,829
which is a fight to the death.

843
01:11:48,438 --> 01:11:52,351
If you came to the set
of a Fukasaku film,

844
01:11:52,638 --> 01:11:55,027
you’ll see for yourself
what we mean by ''Battle Royale''.

845
01:11:56,238 --> 01:11:58,229
The director’s assistant ran away,

846
01:11:58,838 --> 01:12:00,829
The entire crew has
collapsed from exhaustion.

847
01:12:01,438 --> 01:12:02,951
I thought,

848
01:12:03,238 --> 01:12:06,036
is anyone here gonna make
it out in one piece?

849
01:12:06,638 --> 01:12:09,232
I was only there a
few times this month.

850
01:12:10,438 --> 01:12:12,349
But when I came back yesterday,

851
01:12:12,638 --> 01:12:15,232
the whole crew had aged so much...

852
01:12:15,838 --> 01:12:17,430
like almost 20 years it seemed.

853
01:12:18,638 --> 01:12:20,947
Only the director, Fukasaku
is still energetic.

854
01:12:21,238 --> 01:12:24,150
Apparently all that
Philopon (Chinese meth)
he’s been taking works really well.

855
01:12:24,438 --> 01:12:28,033
Seriously, he’s a
fantastic director.

856
01:12:29,438 --> 01:12:31,235
He really is unbelievable.

857
01:12:32,438 --> 01:12:35,350
He’d asked me if I
would be in the film.

858
01:12:35,638 --> 01:12:40,234
I knew about the book,
and I knew the character of the teacher.

859
01:12:41,038 --> 01:12:44,553
He said he wanted me for the role
and I accepted it.

860
01:12:44,838 --> 01:12:47,830
Then he said he wanted to use

861
01:12:48,438 --> 01:12:50,235
my name for the teacher’s character.

862
01:12:50,518 --> 01:12:54,306
I thought, great,
now I’m playing myself.

863
01:12:54,598 --> 01:12:59,194
But even the Katakana
was the same as my real name.

864
01:12:59,638 --> 01:13:01,629
As we began filming

865
01:13:01,918 --> 01:13:04,034
I realized that it was a good thing,

866
01:13:04,318 --> 01:13:08,914
that we hadn’t worked
together ten years ago.

867
01:13:10,638 --> 01:13:13,152
I wouldn’t have started
my own career as a film director,

868
01:13:13,438 --> 01:13:17,351
if he had been able to
direct that film.

869
01:13:17,638 --> 01:13:19,947
