Oh.

00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,281
Ow! Damn it.

12
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,249
[boy] You know, my birthday
isn't for another two months.

13
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,484
I know that.

14

I can make you
pancakes if I want to.

15
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:49,488
I'm good.

16
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,991
Please don't do that.

17
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,126

Have you seen my mug?

21
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:07,673
The one with the
sunflowers on it.

22
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,578

[door opens, shuts]

29
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,104
[man] You should've
gone for the pancakes.

30
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:41,106
And given her the satisfaction?

31
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,278
So when'd you start
sleeping on the couch?

32
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:52,284
No, I just keep on passing out
in front of the TV.

33
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:55,187
I mean,
not that I blame you.

34
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,557
Pretty shitty thing,
what she did.

35
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,959
Hey, hey.
None of that.

36
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,968
So, what, you getting
into fights now?

37
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,570
They were being assholes.

38
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,105
That's no excuse.

39
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,941
Look...

40
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,977
I know things between
your mom and me...

41
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,278
Has nothing to do with this.

42
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,453
So how'd the other kid look?

43
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,655
The other two kids.

44
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,493
One of them cried.

46
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,328

50
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,501
Is that why you're calling?

51
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,936
<i>Well, I also wanna talk.</i>

52
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:52,604
I already ate.
I'll see you later.

Jesus Christ, Connor.

59
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,227
[receptionist] Dr. Harper,
your nine o'clock is here.

60
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,905
[woman]
Justin Whitter, 10 years old.

61
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:02,641
Went missing on a bike ride
last night near Troubadour Park.

62
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,043
Park ranger
found the bike, no boy.

63
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,412
Just like Michael King?

64
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,814
No, we don't know if
the two are connected.

65
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,082
Michael King was abducted

66
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,717
cycling to a corner store
in the city.

67
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:16,321
Justin Whitter, local boy.
Good home, respected family.

68
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:17,589
He went missing on county lines,

69
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,691
but as of nine o'clock
this morning

70
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,159
the case was ruled ours.

71
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,362
Does Spitz know about this?

72
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,498
It's up to him if
he wants to get involved.

73
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,467
He'll wanna get involved.

74
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,837
I'll let you manage the
situation as you see fit.

75
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,940
You're lead on this.

76
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,174
Got it.

77
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,915
[chattering]

78
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,952
[door closes]

79

[thudding]

80
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,843
Connor?

81
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:51,316
Connor?

82
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,354
[screams, gasps]
Whoa! Whoa.

83
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,323
I'm just a window repairman.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

84
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,192
What are you doing here?
Your husband called about a broken window.

85
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,194
Just finished putting
in a new one for you.

86
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,263
Oh, my God.

87
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,799
[repairman] Okeydokey.

88
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,434
Just give me a jingle if you
have any problems with it,

89
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,036
and have a good day.

90
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,137
Thank you.

91
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,039
I'm sorry, who let you in?

92
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,874
That kid of yours.
Very polite.

93
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,643
You trained her well.
[phone ringing]

94
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,679
Who?
[repairman] Yeah, John. No.

95
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:28,153
And the truth is,
anything you find

96
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,321
could be important.

97
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:35,293
Justin was last seen wearing a
green soccer jersey and carrying...

98
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,495
[detective]
Gonna want answers, and fast.

99
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:41,332
So the kid's riding his bike
all alone through the woods.

100
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,134
The parents are okay with that?

101
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,537
[detective] He's 10.
Figure he's old enough.

102
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,074
[Greg] How's the home life?
You know, really.

103
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,742
Mom, dad, two happy kids.

104
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,978
Perfect all-American family.
[phone ringing]

105
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,580
Yeah.

106
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,716
Aren't they all?

107
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,885
Lisa and I went through
that rough patch last year.

108
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,387
Hey, come on, Spitz.

109
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,489
Look,

110
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:06,324
I'm not saying I know anything.

111
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,093
Just there was this counselor.

112
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,894
Jackie is a counselor.

113
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,397
[sighs] Yeah.
We'll be fine.

114
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,165
[man]
There's something up here!

115
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,269
[shutter clicks]

116
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,572
All right, step away.
What you got?

117
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,446
Jesus Christ.

118
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,583
[policewoman] Sir,
should we bring it in?

119
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,119
Yeah.
Yeah, you can...

120
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,588
You can bag it.

121
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,690
Thanks, Kayla.

122
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,261
Spitz.

123
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,931
You okay?

124
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,534
You remember Cole Gordon?
It was before your time.

125
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:50,769
Oh, of course I remember.

126
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,036
The green knives.

127
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,773
Six boys.

128
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,242
All found buried
with those knives.

129
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,543
Yeah, I know.

130
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,312
But Gordon, he's...

131
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,547
Yeah, yeah,
I helped put him there,

132
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,149
and he ain't getting out.

133
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,550
So what're you thinking?

134
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,389
[slurping]

135
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,206
Could you pass the dressing?

136
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,815
Thank you.

137
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:42,053
Hey, did you let a repairman in
today when I wasn't here?

138
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,656
Jesus, Mom,
is that who it was?

139
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:47,892
Did you screw a repairman?

140
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,032
Okay.

141
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,301
Okay, you're angry.

142
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:57,669
How could you do that?

143
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,372
How could you do that to Dad?

144
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,413
Who was it?

145
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,983
Just someone, sweetie...

146
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,285
Oh, you don't get
to call me that.

147
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:17,055
You don't ever get
to call me that again.

148
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,489
I see how mad you are.

149
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,458
You don't get to act
like nothing happened!

150
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,994
You think pancakes and fancy
dinners are gonna make it up?

151
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:26,531
No, I don't... You ruined our family
and you should fucking pay for it!

<i>So it's really normal for him to
ride his bike home from school.</i>

181
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:09,901
<i>Everybody in the
neighborhood knows him.</i>

182
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,637
<i>He's just a
really great kid.</i>

183
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,668
Hey.
How'd you get in here?

184
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,040
Come here.

185
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:56,180
Where are you going?

186
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,055
Come on.

187
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,695
Yeah, this is your room,
but, no, not in there.

188
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,266
Hey, come on.

189
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,338
Come on.

190
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,472
I'm not gonna hurt you.

191
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:22,974
[door thudding]

192
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:24,375
Connor?

193
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,581
Connor, come on.

194
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,588
You're hilarious,
but let me out now.

195
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,062
Connor?

196
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,499
Connor, open the door!
[banging]

197
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,337
Open the door. I'm serious!

198
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,775
Connor, open this door!
[thudding]

199
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:00,645
Connor!

200
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,283
What're you doing?

201
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,618
What are you doing?

202
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,253
I heard pounding,
so I came up the...

203
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,688
Where's Connor?

204
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,023
He's out.

205
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,025
What?

206
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:31,375
[footsteps approaching]

207
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,543
Anything?

208
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,381
No.

209
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,284
Do you wanna call the station?

210
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,822
You know, maybe I'm just tired.

211
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,062
Why don't you sleep
upstairs tonight?

212
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,258
Yeah, I'm gonna move some
stuff into the guest room.

213
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:01,239
I know you can't
just forgive me.

214
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,276
I don't expect you to,
I really don't.

215
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:08,112
But I want you to know I'll do
whatever it takes to make...

216
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,814
Did you wanna get married?

217
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,152
What?
What do you mean?

218
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:17,755
A shitty cop making shitty pay,
this out-of-towner who your parents hated.

219
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,423
My parents didn't hate you.
Your dad hated me

220
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,592
'cause he knew I wouldn't
provide for you like he did,

221
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:22,860
like he did with
this fucking house.

222
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,362
I never needed you
to provide for me.

223
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,463
I never wanted that.

224
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,098
I wanted that.

225
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,724
You really think we'd still be together
if you hadn't gotten pregnant?

226
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,209
I'm glad things worked out
the way they did.

227
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,280
I'm trying, Greg.

228
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,926
[groaning]

229
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,628
[male voice, indistinct]

00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,236
[voice continues, indistinct]

231
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,789
[gamer 1] <i>What about the guy on top?</i>
[gamer 2] <i>Watch it. Up there.</i>

232
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,625
[gamer 2] <i>Eleven o'clock.</i>
[gamer 1] <i>Yep. Covered.</i>

233
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:01,959
[gamer 1]
<i>Don't shoot me in the face!</i>

[gamer 2]
<i>I know, man, I'm covering you!</i>

235
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,029
[gamer 1]
<i>Right there, right there, dude.</i>

236
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,864
[audio stops]

237
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:22,280
What're you doing?

238
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:26,450
Where were you?

239
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:28,319
I was thirsty.

240
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:33,190
It's a little late to be playing video games,
isn't it?

241
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,461
I'm taking you
to school tomorrow.

242
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,729
What? Why?

243
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:39,997
Doesn't matter,
I'm just taking you.

244
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,966
I'm not gonna
get kidnapped, Mom.

245
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,502
Oh, my God, I haven't
seen him in forever.

246
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:48,239
Hippie. Remember him?

247
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:49,974
No.

248
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,425
Mom.

249
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:12,530
Good night.

250
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,737
[phone ringing]

251
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,978
Hello.

252
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,913
[Spitz]
<i>Davis wants to see us. Now.</i>

253
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,949
Yeah, okay.
I'll be right there.

254
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:31,876
Sorry.

255
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:33,144
What'd I miss?

256
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,114
[Spitz] Cole Gordon.

257
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,216
A closed case.
I got pulled out of bed for this.

258
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,518
[Davis]
You know why you're here, Spitz.

259
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,086
The MO is an exact match

260
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,755
of a serial child abductor
you put away 15 years ago.

261
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,958
I was on the phone with your old
partner while you were all tucked up.

262
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:51,128
They sent what they
still had on hand.

263
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,330
Jesus Christ.
Put that shit away.

264
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,567
Gordon's defense
attorney's trying to use it

265
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:58,035
to build a case for a mistrial.

266
00:23:58,037 --> 00:23:59,437
They didn't waste any time.

267
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,071
I'm sorry to disappoint
the dickhead lawyer,

268
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:03,107
but Gordon was a
convicted pedophile

269
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,309
with a trunk packed
full of those knives,

270
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:07,878
not to mention clothes from half a dozen
of the victims we found at his house.

271
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,613
[Davis] Yeah, well,
it's probably a copycat.

272
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,715
But we need to get
in front of this.

273
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:14,718
I sent Larson to track down the two
boys that escaped, Braun and Travers.

274
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,954
[Spitz] <i>Oh, Jesus Christ.</i>

275
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,889
[Davis] <i>Yeah, it's been 15 years,
but they might remember details now</i>

276
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,591
<i>that could help impede
Gordon's defense.</i>

277
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:22,326
I wasn't wrong.

278
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:24,662
I interviewed both those boys
extensively when it happened.

279
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:28,265
There's no doubt.
No doubt.

280
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,534
Then why'd you end up
with us, Ray?

281
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,406
Get his address.

282
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,787
[man] <i>But he went to prison.
He's locked away.</i>

283
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:51,956
[Spitz] To the best of our
knowledge he is, Mr. Braun.

284
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:54,592
But we'd like to talk
to your son, if that's possible.

285
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,927
[Mr. Braun] He's out back.

286
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:11,675
Tommy.

287
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:13,511
Tommy?

288
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:16,514
There's some nice men
here to see you.

289
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:19,884
[breathing heavily]

290
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,252
[Spitz] Tommy?

291
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:23,254
Remember me?

292
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,293
Officer Spitzky.

293
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,163
It's been
a long time, Tommy,

294
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:36,033
but I still have that
brontosaurus you gave me.

295
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:40,938
Tommy?

296
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:49,146
[whimpering]

297
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:52,716
No, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no!

298
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:55,152
No! No! No!

299
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:57,021
No! No!

300
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:58,088
No!

301
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,224
[gasping]

302
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:03,994
[Spitz, on recording]
<i>Hey, Tommy.</i>

303
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:06,363
<i>Tommy?</i>

304
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:08,732
<i>Can you start
at the beginning for me?</i>

305
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,068
<i>I need you to answer
my questions, okay?</i>

306
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,736
<i>I know you're scared.</i>

307
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,338
[young Tommy]
<i>There was a man.</i>

308
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,307
[Spitz] <i>A man?</i>

309
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:18,709
<i>Someone you knew?</i>

310
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:21,612
[young Tommy]
<i>No, but he said he knew us.</i>

311
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,781
[Spitz]
<i>Where did you see him?</i>

312
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:26,283
[young Tommy]
<i>Watching us on the tracks.</i>

313
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:29,086
[Spitz] <i>Did he do that
to your face, Tommy?</i>

314
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,455
[young Tommy]
<i>I did it to myself.</i>

315
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:34,425
<i>After the little house
in the trees.</i>

316
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,226
[Spitz]
<i>Is that where he took you?</i>

317
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:38,028
<i>Do you think you can
remember where it is?</i>

318
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,097
[young Tommy]
<i>It's not there anymore.</i>

319
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,233
<i>It's a magic house.
It disappears.</i>

320
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:44,935
[Spitz]
<i>What does that mean?</i>

321
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:48,172
[young Tommy] <i>It means...
you're never gonna find him.</i>

322

324
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:21,572
Hey.

325
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:23,574
What are you doing here?

326
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:25,109
I took the bus out
this morning.

327
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:26,777
I'm staying with a college
buddy in Braxfield.

328
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,178
Did you not get my messages?

329
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,848
You cannot be here.
My son is here.

330
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,017
Well, let's go somewhere.
Take the day off work.

331
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:35,319
It's so good to see you.
No, no, no, no.

332
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,087
Did you not get my texts?

333
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,625
Did I freak you out by what I said last time?
No.

334
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:44,528
Because that was a whole different...
Because I'm in love with you!

335
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,896
I'm in love with you,
Jackie.

336
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,166
I can't...

337
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,070
I don't want to be with you.

338
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:55,806
Jackie, listen.
I know you're scared.

339
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:58,642
Todd, stop! I'm scared too.
But what we have, you know...

[shattering]
[groans]

00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:01,278

Oh, my God.

[Todd]
Ow. What the hell?

343
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,982
Jesus.
Let me see.

344
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:06,717
No, no,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

345
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,652
I'm fine.
I gotta sit down.

346
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:10,287
No, no, come with me.
Come with me.

347
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:13,023
Okay. All right, honey.
I'm good.

348
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:15,125
Oh, my God.

349
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:18,228
What the fuck?

[Todd] Oh, Jesus.

353
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,075
Jackie.
Careful.

354
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:33,711
This reminds me of high school.
Remember?

355
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:36,714
Sneaking into your parents'
basement all those times.

356
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:37,981
[Jackie] Here we go.

357
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,750
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What? Okay.

358
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:41,819
Ow. Whoa.

359
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,887
Whoa.
This is like...

360
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,189
Come here.

361
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:46,557
[Todd] This kinda
hurts a little bit.

362
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,926
Come here.
Oh, nice. [groans]

363
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:51,061
This is great. Yeah.

364
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,363
Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

365
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:54,665
Be careful.

366
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,972
[muffled voices, indistinct]

367
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:11,782
Mom?

368
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:17,521
Honey, you'd make
an amazing nurse.

369
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:20,357
Oh, ow! Fuck.

370
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,259
Oh.

371
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,261
As soon as Connor
goes to school,

372
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,363
I think I should take you
to the hospital.

373
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,893
[phone ringing]
Yeah, that sounds great.

374
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:57,961
You're calling me.

375
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,064
Where's your phone?
What're you talking about?

376
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,399
Where's your phone?

377
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:05,903
[guitar playing on phone]
Hello?

378
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:09,139
Hello?

379
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,941
Did you leave
your phone somewhere?

380
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:13,010
[phone chiming]
[chuckles] My phone.

381

[music stops]

383
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:38,068
Did you turn this on?

384
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,437
No.

385
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,539
Were you just up on the roof?

386
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,341
What?
No, what're you talking about?

387
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,843
You said you were
taking me to school.

388
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:47,244
I am.

389
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:50,714
Is something wrong?

390
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,585
Get in the car.
I'll be right there.

391
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:05,729
Connor, if you did something,
if you were upset...

392
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,130
What're you talking about?

393
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:08,465
You can tell me.
I won't be mad.

394
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:09,733
I just want...
Mom!

395
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:11,101
[tires screech]

396
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:17,641
Sorry to bother you,
Mrs. Harper.

397
00:31:17,643 --> 00:31:19,810
No, Mrs. Whitter,
I'm so sorry for your son...

398
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:22,846
Has he heard anything?
Your husband?

399
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,882
I-I... I'm not sure.

400
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:27,084
I know they're doing
everything they can.

401
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:32,422
My son is
out there somewhere.

402
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,092
They're gonna find him.

403
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:38,795
Greg is going to find him.

404
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,065
Yeah.

405
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,569
Thanks.

406
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,996

[thuds]
[groans]

408
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:18,903
[Greg]
You think he knew him?

409
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:20,597
What?

410
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,099
Justin Whitter.

411
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,268
Chances are
he knew the kidnapper.

412
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,604
Maybe.

413
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:31,775
No, think about it.

414
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,245
Kid's on his bike.

415
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:38,415
Sees the perp.
They know each other.

416
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,717
So the kids stops.

417
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:43,887
He grabs him,

418
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:46,623
drops one of the knives
to throw us off.

419
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,293
Spitz?
Maybe.

420
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:54,965
Or...

421
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,436
He stops the kid.

422
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:22,059
Sorry it took so long,
I didn't...

423
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:23,293

427
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,923
Help me.

428
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:56,726
Jesus Christ, Jackie.
Walk me through what happened.

429
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:58,428
Everything.
We were talking.

430
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,063
[breath shudders]
[Greg] Just talking?

431
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:03,567
Yes, we were talking
by the side of the house.

432
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,435
I explained that we were over,

433
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,472
and out of nowhere
it just fell.

434
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:12,109
It was bleeding,
but it wasn't like that.

435
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,578
Why didn't you call an ambulance?
Is there anyone you can call?

436
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,314
Why didn't you call an ambulance?
It was Connor.

437
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:19,449
[sobs]

438
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,817
What?

439
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:23,127
[sobbing]
He was upstairs.

440
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:26,556
He's been so angry.

441
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:28,091
So angry.

442
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:29,993
So angry he tried
to kill someone.

443
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:33,063
Maybe it was an accident?
Jesus Christ, Jackie.

444
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:34,998
I don't know
what's happening...

445
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,501
No, no! You don't get
to lose it right now!

446
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,169
Listen to me.

447
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:41,304
Do you know...

448
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,574
what will happen to our son?

449
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,213
I won't be able to protect him.

450
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,230
Go change out of those clothes.

Drive straight to the hospital.
Don't stop for anything.

00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:47,637
I'll call you when
I'm on my way.

477
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,873
I'll find him, Jackie! I'm gonna find
the son of a bitch who did this.

478
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,074
Drive.

seen our kidnapper.

And Harper's not
answering his cell.

485
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,696
I can pick him up.

Did you get that on camera?

gonna happen. I was so close.

You see this view?

[girl] What?

Look at all that wine.

504
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,995

not have friends?

sleep somewhere out of sight?

521
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:35,825
I did.

522
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:38,060
Let me take you
to our sleeping quarters.

523
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,830

00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:12,795
I should probably tell you a little
bit about what we're doing. Um...

534
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:16,999
So this is a documentary.
Yeah. Um...

535
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:23,472
It's to give you all a look at how a
professional phrog goes about phrogging.

536
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:25,308
They call us phrogs
with a "P-H"

537
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:28,444
because we hop
from pad to pad

538
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:31,314
undetected by the people
who actually live in the house.

539
00:47:31,316 --> 00:47:34,851
Usually I try to stay in a place for no
longer than, like, four or five days

540
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:37,019
'cause it makes it harder
to be discovered.

541
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:39,555
For the most part, I really try to disrupt
their lives as little as possible.

542
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:42,558
Oh, and it's a good thing that
these people have a guest room.

543
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,660
That's what you wanna look for.

544
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:48,731
A room that is rarely used by the
family that you can make headquarters.

545
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:50,299
As you can see,

546
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:52,368
I'm eating some of their food.

547
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,537
Um, this is allowed
because, you know,

548
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:57,506
um... a girl's gotta eat.

549
00:47:57,508 --> 00:47:59,976
We just try not to take
too much of one thing.

550
00:47:59,978 --> 00:48:01,677
[shrieks]
[laughing]

551
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,746
You asshole!
Alec!

552
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:10,720
This disturbing creature is my cameraman,
Alec. [laughing]

553
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:12,755
I can't believe you brought
this creepy thing with you.

554
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:14,323
What? It's fitting.
We're phrogs.

555
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:16,025
It's a frog.
You're such a freak.

556
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:19,562
He has never done this before,
so I'm showing him the ropes

557
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:22,665
while he documents
with his nifty camera.

558
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,066
Oh, I also let him
pick out this house.

559
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,035
And I sure know how
to pick 'em, huh?

560
00:48:26,037 --> 00:48:27,670
So far, so good.

561
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:29,338
This is
the best part of the day.

562
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,274
We get to be loud,
and we have the house to ourselves

563
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:32,909
and we can
move about freely.

564
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:34,377
But when they come home,

565
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:36,779
we have to stick
to our hiding places

566
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:37,947
and stay quiet.

567
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:40,383
And that part's gonna suck.

568
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:41,584
Yep.

569
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,786
[camera beeps]

570
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:49,125
[whispering] So...

571
00:48:50,395 --> 00:48:54,430
It is ten minutes
after 2:00 a.m.

572
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:57,233
Alec and I fell asleep,

573
00:48:57,235 --> 00:49:01,370
and the family must've come home
while we were passed out.

574
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:05,541
Alec, are you awake?

575
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:10,212
Alec? Alec?

576
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:12,014
[camera beeps]

577
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:20,890
Alec?

578
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:23,559
What the hell are you doing?

579
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:26,362
[Alec] I was bored.

580
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:30,499
[girl] You can't just go
outside whenever you want.

581
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,970
[Alec] He just got home.

582
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:35,371
[girl] Who?

583
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:38,207
[Alec] The husband.

584
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:40,176
[girl] Did he see you?

585
00:49:41,446 --> 00:49:43,512
[Alec] Yeah, I mean,
he saw me. He waved.

586
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:45,815
[girl] Okay, very funny.
Come on. Get back inside.

587
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,596
[camera beeps]

588
00:50:03,034 --> 00:50:04,934
[Alec] Sweet dreams.

589
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:11,841
And here we go.

590
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:05,728
[snores]

591
00:51:24,282 --> 00:51:26,315
[static crackles]

592
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:35,925
[knife clinks]
[sizzling]

593
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:44,800
[Jackie] We're gonna be late.

594
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:03,919
[girl] Hey, are you insane?

595
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:05,921
You trying to set off
a smoke alarm?

596
00:52:05,923 --> 00:52:08,591
Yes.
Stay away from the window.

597
00:52:08,593 --> 00:52:11,327
God, who knew this phrogging thing would
give you such a stick up your ass?

598
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:13,829
Shh! Hushed voices.

599
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:15,331
Sorry.

600
00:52:20,505 --> 00:52:23,005
Dude, I don't think you
understand how dangerous this is.

601
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:26,408
We could go to jail. We're breaking
so many laws just by being here.

602
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,010
I do understand.

603
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:31,247
But isn't that part of the fun,
almost getting caught?

604
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:33,883
No, the fun is to not come
close to getting caught.

605
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:46,829
Wanna play the word game?

606
00:52:50,101 --> 00:52:52,134
What is it with you
and that word game?

607
00:52:52,136 --> 00:52:53,836
Something to fucking do.

608
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:56,705
Okay, you're the one who's been
hounding me to come along.

609
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:58,541
I was perfectly happy
doing this alone.

610
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,044
I know.

611
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,813
I'm glad to.

612
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:07,516
I just thought it
would be a little more...

613
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:09,885
less shit.

614
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:12,421
[giggling]

615
00:53:13,991 --> 00:53:16,625
It's better than...
[phone ringing]

616
00:53:16,627 --> 00:53:18,727
...subways and park benches.

617
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:20,462
[phone ringing]

618
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:24,633
Just about.

619
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:36,478
Okay.

620
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:40,616
I'm thinking of a...

621
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,686
seven-letter word.

622
00:53:43,688 --> 00:53:45,221
It starts with a "B."

623
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:50,559
[glass shattering]

624
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:12,915
[footsteps approaching]

625
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:14,016
[door opens]

[footsteps continue]

627
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:31,533
[gasps]

628
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,537
[Greg] Jesus Christ, Connor.

629
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:37,106
[Alec] Bastard.

630
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,941
What?

631
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:41,210
[Alec] Seven-letter word,
starts with "B."

632
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:13,342
[girl]
Mission accomplished.

633
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,213
There's so many places
to hide shit down there.

634
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:22,184
If we need a quick escape,
that's our route.

635
00:55:25,623 --> 00:55:27,423
Check it out.

636
00:55:27,425 --> 00:55:30,192
[man on TV, indistinct]
How'd you do that?

637
00:55:30,194 --> 00:55:31,827
Downloaded an app.

638
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:34,530
They keep their Wi-Fi password
next to the chore chart.

639
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:38,434
You are such a freak.

640
00:55:38,436 --> 00:55:41,370
[man on TV continues,
indistinct]

641
00:55:42,973 --> 00:55:45,207
Wouldn't it be kinda funny
to mess with them?

642
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:49,445
Take some random shit,
make them think they're going crazy?

643
00:55:49,447 --> 00:55:50,713
No.

644
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:53,048
It wouldn't.

645
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,951
Stop touching stuff, okay?

646
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:01,390
Can you believe
how loaded these people are?

647
00:56:01,392 --> 00:56:05,327
They have so much money,
and this is the shit they decide to buy?

648
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:07,396
The wife's some sort
of doctor, I think.

649
00:56:07,398 --> 00:56:08,964
It was on her mail.

650
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:11,333
Dr. "Stepford Wife."
[doorbell rings]

651
00:56:11,335 --> 00:56:12,768
Shit.

652
00:56:14,305 --> 00:56:16,338
[repairman] Hello?

653
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,974
Someone call about a broken window?
Just a second!

654
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:21,777
[Alec] Just let him in.
He doesn't know you don't live here.

655
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:34,423
[repairman] Hi. I got a call
about a broken window.

656
00:56:34,425 --> 00:56:36,592
[girl]
Yeah, that was my dad.

657
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:37,926
Uh, it's right this way.

658
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:40,562
[girl, repairman chattering]

659
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:23,038
[garage door opens]

660
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:30,212
Alec! Come on!

661
00:57:30,214 --> 00:57:31,480
Now!

662
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,486
I'm just a window repairman.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

663
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:39,988
[Jackie] What're you doing here? [repairman]
Your husband called about a broken window.

664
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:41,623
Just finished
putting in a new one.

665
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,326
No more going downstairs.

666
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:57,406
Ha-ha. Level 59.

667
00:57:57,408 --> 00:57:58,941
Suck it, asshole.

668
00:57:58,943 --> 00:58:00,676
This is so messed up.

669
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:04,246
Another kid got swiped.

670
00:58:05,249 --> 00:58:07,416
Here, in this town.

671
00:58:07,418 --> 00:58:10,986
Justin Whitter.
Ten years old.

672
00:58:12,189 --> 00:58:13,655
Oh, yeah, Justin.

673
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:16,458
You know him?

674
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,427
No, Mindy, I kinda stopped
hanging out with ten-year-olds

675
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:19,595
when I was, like, ten.

676
00:58:19,597 --> 00:58:21,997
Okay, yeah.
Fucking hysterical.

677
00:58:22,766 --> 00:58:24,700
Dude, this is sad.

678
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:27,302
"Last seen wearing
a green soccer jersey.

679
00:58:27,304 --> 00:58:30,005
Went missing
in Troubadour Park."

680
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:32,508
Sucks for him.

681
00:58:33,544 --> 00:58:35,210
Yeah, it does.

682
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:38,714
Here's your bottle.

683
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,517
Okay.

684
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:42,918
Thanks.

685
00:58:43,454 --> 00:58:45,454
Gotta stay hydrated.

686
00:58:45,456 --> 00:58:46,955
Thanks, Dad.

no, not in there.

01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:44,940
[Greg]
What are you doing?

710
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:46,508
[Jackie] I heard pounding,
so I came up the...

711
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:47,943
[Greg] Where's Connor?

712
01:00:47,945 --> 01:00:49,311
[Jackie] He's out.

713
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:51,680
[Greg] What?

714
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:55,544
[urine trickling]

715
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:02,617
[wind howling]

716
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:31,046
[whispering] Alec!

717
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:34,082
Alec!
Get back inside right now!

718
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:35,584
What if someone sees you?

719
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:39,988
What happened to the bed?

720
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:43,258
Husband pissed himself.

721
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:46,094
Or so he thinks.

722
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:47,462
What?

723
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,197
Alec.

724
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,867
Come on. You promised.

725
01:02:52,703 --> 01:02:54,503
You said that
you would be cool.

726
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:57,672
I'm not finished playing yet.

727
01:02:58,876 --> 01:03:00,609
Playing with what?

728
01:03:01,979 --> 01:03:05,447
No. No. That's not how this works.
[Todd speaking, indistinct]

729
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:08,216
Okay? We don't mess
with these people.

730
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:10,385
We don't terrorize them.
We coexist.

731
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:11,987
Then what's the point?

732
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:16,591
What's the point if we don't make
them question their sanity a little?

733
01:03:16,593 --> 01:03:20,061
[Todd] Honey,
did I freak you out by what I said last time?

734
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:23,198
[breathing heavily]
I mean it.

735
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:27,235
Come on, please.

736
01:03:29,673 --> 01:03:31,740
[Jackie]
I don't want to be with you.

737
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:35,577
Okeydokey.

738
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,580
[shattering]
[Todd groans]

739
01:03:38,582 --> 01:03:39,915
What the...

740
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,350
[Todd] What the hell?

741
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:43,652
[Jackie] Let me see.

742
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:45,294
[Todd] No, no, no,
I'm fine. I'm fine.

743
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:47,756
I gotta sit down.

744
01:03:47,758 --> 01:03:49,825
[Jackie] No, no, no,
Come with me. Come with me.

745
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,198
What the fuck did you just do?
Relax. It's a little bump.

746
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,433
What is wrong with you?
Nothing is wrong with me.

747
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:00,168
Do you realize that
they're gonna call the cops?

748
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,937
No, they're not.
We have to get out of here.

749
01:04:01,939 --> 01:04:03,104
Yeah, you do.

750
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:05,540
What?

751
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,375
What is going on?

752
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:09,344
Why are you doing this,
Alec?

753
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:12,647
Okay, I brought you here
because I trusted you.

754
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:14,182
I know.

755
01:04:15,052 --> 01:04:16,685
And I'm sorry.

756
01:04:22,626 --> 01:04:24,292
But I'm having fun.

757
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:28,697
I don't know
what you're talking about.

758
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:31,032
What's going on?
Alec, I don't know what's happening.

That's it.

764
01:05:24,888 --> 01:05:26,488
We're leaving right now.

765
01:05:29,526 --> 01:05:30,926
Okay.

766
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:34,863
Okay.

767
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,300
Shit.

768
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:42,170
Our stuff is
in the basement.

769
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:46,775
Great plan.
Well, it would've been.

770
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:53,248
We need to figure out a way
to get them out of the house

771
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:56,217
or just distract them
or something.

772

He dropped his phone.

[Connor] No.

778
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:40,195
[Jackie] Where you
just up on the roof?

779
01:06:40,197 --> 01:06:41,663
What?
No, what're you talking about?

780
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:43,298
You said you were
taking me to school.

781
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,532
[Jackie] I am.

782
01:06:44,534 --> 01:06:46,668
Get in the car.
I'll be right there.

785
01:08:19,062 --> 01:08:20,395
Knew it was in there.

786
01:08:20,397 --> 01:08:21,696
Good man.

call an ambulance?</i>

you can call?</i>

794
01:09:42,445 --> 01:09:45,046
[Greg] Why didn't you call an ambulance?
[Jackie] It was Connor.

795
01:09:45,048 --> 01:09:47,382
[Greg] What?
[Jackie] He was upstairs.

796
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:49,851
He's been so angry.

797
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:51,352
[Greg] So angry he tried
to kill someone.

798
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:53,288
[Jackie]
Maybe it was an accident.

799
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:55,456
I don't know what's happening.

800
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:57,792
No, no! You don't get
to lose it right now!

801
01:09:58,495 --> 01:09:59,761
Listen to me.

802
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:05,033
Do you know...
what will happen to our son?

803
01:10:08,672 --> 01:10:10,371

Get out.

807
01:11:20,143 --> 01:11:22,277
Don't look at me like that.

808
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,213
You're insane.

809
01:11:30,153 --> 01:11:31,986
Please.
I'm calling the cops.

810
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:34,589
No, I am not going to let you
ruin this for me. Get off me!
