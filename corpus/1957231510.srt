180
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:29,057
- [Chase] Come on.
Water under the bridge.

181
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:31,755
We're gonna have fun tonight.

182
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:32,974
[Singing]

183
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:34,584
You might wanna speed
up a little bit.

184
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:36,151
[Laughing]

185
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:37,544
Don't be mad.

186
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:43,071
You did good, good getaway.

187
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:44,333
[Laughing]

188
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:45,726
- Stop.

189
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:47,945
- [Chase] Okay,
where's the bottle?

190
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:50,295
I know I brought it up here.

191
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,993
I think we could all
use a little drink,

192
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:54,430
maybe you guys won't
be so pissed off at me.

193
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:57,955
Come on, I said I was sorry.

194
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:00,001
- I don't care, Amanda's
gonna probably have

195
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:01,393
a hit and run on her record,

196
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:02,960
which probably
means prison time,

197
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:06,486
but I was just a helpless
passenger mister officer.

198
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:08,923
- [Chase] Can you please
stop with all that?

199
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,141
You're freaking her out.

200
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:12,274
She would get a slap
on the wrist, maybe,

201
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:15,538
and that's only if they
catch her, which they won't.

202
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:16,713
Hey.

203
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:20,456
I'm sorry, I really am.

204
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,936
- Why do you have that thing on?

205
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:23,503
Are you trying to
incriminate me even more?

206
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:24,982
- [Chase] No! I'm...

207
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:28,246
Documenting the best
weekend of your life.

208
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,119
You're gonna want this
for posterity, trust me.

209
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:40,476
Can you ever forgive me?

210
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,219
Dearest maiden, I beg of thee,

211
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:47,178
forgiveness, for I have sinned.

212
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:49,659
- Okay, get up.
- [Chase] I knew it.

213
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:50,965
- Get up!

214
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:52,227
- I'm serious!

215
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,664
- You are a bad
influence, you know that?

216
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,101
- [Chase] That is
the best complement

217
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:58,973
a girl like you
could ever give me.

218
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:01,149
- Is this what you were
looking for, asshole?

219
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:02,977
- [Chase] Yes. Yes it is.

220
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:05,849
Wow.

221
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:10,245
Very nice, very nice.

222
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:12,247
Okay, Kim, you're up, come on.

223
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,596
Where are you?

224
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:16,164
- Look, if you're gonna
be mad all weekend,

225
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:17,905
just get it outta
your system now,

226
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,863
and then come take
a drink with us.

227
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:21,996
This is where we are, you know.

228
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,041
I can't change it,
it is what it is.

229
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:26,217
- [Chase] Thanks.

230
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:27,131
Mm-hmm.

231
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:30,091
Yeah, oh yeah.

232
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:30,961
- [Amanda] Oh my god!

233
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:32,615
- [Chase] Woah!

234
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,269
Nice, Amanda,
where'd you get her?

235
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,967
- We're a package deal.

236
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:41,189
[Laughing]

237
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:43,104
You got a little dribble?

238
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:44,105
- Yeah.

239
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:47,021
- See? And if you push this...

240
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,763
It makes up for all the shadows.

241
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:51,373
Here, look at this
little screen.

242
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,549
- That's so very interesting.

243
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,508
- I can tell you're
fascinated Kim.

244
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:59,294
Where's the other...

245
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:01,165
- So you really think
you have a shot?

246
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:03,515
- Does it matter?

247
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,821
[Laughing]

248
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:07,998
- Well, not to her, I
mean, she loves it, but...

249
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:10,044
[Electronic squeal]

250
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:11,262
Woah.

251
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:14,657
- [Chase] Wait, but what?

252
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,313
- Well, she'll never touch
you, you know that right?

253
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:21,664
I mean, she's not into younger
guys, even the hot ones.

254
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:25,102
Not that you're...

255
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:28,149
[Laughing]

256
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:33,633
This whole perfect Princess
thing she's got going on?

257
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:35,635
It's not real.

258
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:39,900
But, I guess, work it if
you've got it though, right?

259
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:42,119
I mean, I'd do her.

260
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:45,993
What button were
you trying to push?

261
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,604
On the camera?

262
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,737
- [Chase] Oh.

263
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:53,087
[Camera snaps]
- [Both] Woah.

264
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,523
- This shit is stronger
than I thought.

265
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:58,092
Um, okay, so...

266
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,660
Just rewind one second.

267
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,185
You just say you'd do her?

268
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:06,883
- Okay, relax there tiger.

269
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:09,669
I'm just sayin, you know,

270
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,583
don't get so caught
up in the act.

271
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:13,977
She'll chew you up and spit
you out when she's done.

272
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:17,154
Just kinda funny, that's all.

273
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:20,941
- [Chase] So you two have
been friends for how long?

274
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,421
- Like, forever.

275
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:27,512
- [Chase] I see the
bond is very strong.

276
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,079
- Unbreakable.

277
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:34,476
- Okay, goozer, wills, Donnie,

278
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:38,393
I'm about to document every
second of this weekend,

279
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:41,439
not just for a
couple of douchebags

280
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:43,311
who didn't think I
could pull this off.

281
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:46,357
But really, just for
any man who's ever,

282
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:49,012
had a dream.

283
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,277
Every second of this weekend

284
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:56,237
will be better than
every remaining second

285
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,326
of all your lives combined.

286
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:01,155
That's a promise.

287
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:02,939
[Laughing]

288
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:04,114
- What are you doing?

289
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:06,334
- [Chase] Here we are,

290
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:09,467
looking for the female
in her natural habitat.

291
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:13,254
The trick is to approach slowly.

292
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:16,083
These females scare very easily,

293
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:18,085
but if done just right,

294
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:21,088
then it's worth every second.

295
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:32,926
- Oh my god, chase,
what are you doing?

296
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:34,623
Get out you little perv.

297
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,451
- Oh, I didn't know you
were in there, I'm so sorry.

298
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:37,757
- You better erase that.

299
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,324
- Of course, I'm doing
it right now. I promise.

300
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:43,458
Love the pink lace though.

301
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:47,114
No, turn it off, I wanna
see how much I can get.

302
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:50,813
- [Kim] How close
are we to the town?

303
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:52,293
- [Chase] Uh, kinda far.

304
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,687
My parents have had this
place for like a year.

305
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:57,689
They say it's very peaceful.

306
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,039
Kinda creepy though, huh?

307
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:00,736
- [Amanda] What
are you guys doing?

308
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:02,825
- [Chase] Hmm.

309
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:04,087
- [Amanda] What?

310
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:06,916
- [Chase] People out there.

311
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:11,051
Can you see that light?
It's like a fire.

312
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:13,488
- [Kim] Let me see it.

313
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:18,841
Okay, this is kind of creepy.

314
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:20,016
- [Amanda] Hey, I wanna see.

315
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,409
- [Kim] Is that the truck?

316
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:22,497
- [Amanda] What?

317
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:25,892
Oh my god that's it,

318
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:27,371
it's a truck with one headlight,

319
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:28,895
a guy and a little girl.

320
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:30,461
- [Chase] There's no way.

321
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:32,812
- [Amanda] That's totally it,
I just saw the little girl.

322
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:36,337
You even said that barely
anyone lives out here.

323
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:40,123
How far out is that?

324
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:41,951
- [Chase] I would say
maybe a half mile.

325
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:45,868
- [Kim] Isn't that a
little weird chase?

326
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:47,914
It's like the middle of nowhere.

327
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,524
How'd they get out there?

328
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,047
- [Chase] I have no idea.

329
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:54,094
- [Kim] Is there an
alarm in the house?

330
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:57,924
What if they see the house
lights and try to walk up here?

331
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:58,968
[Banging]

332
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:04,104
- Was that from inside?

333
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:08,935
- Okay, that was a little
weird chase, what was it?

334
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:10,893
- [Chase] I don't know.

335
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:13,200
- Okay, well it definitely
came from inside the house.

336
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:17,160
Do you wanna call the
police or something?

337
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:19,032
- [Chase] No, relax,
it was just a noise.

338
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:20,511
- Kim, don't call the police.

339
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:23,123
- [Chase] The woods
are full of noises,

340
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,777
it was probably a
raccoon or something.

341
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:28,084
- You have raccoons
living in your house?

342
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:30,086
- [Chase] Okay, first of
all, this isn't my house,

343
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,914
this is my parents
mountain house.

344
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,003
We don't know if that
was inside or not.

345
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:37,006
- Chase, I have
extremely good hearing,

346
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,878
that came from downstairs.

347
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:43,143
Where are you going?

348
00:14:43,186 --> 00:14:45,580
- [Chase] Going to prove
you wrong, supersonic ears.

349
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:47,103
- By yourself?

350
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:49,149
- [Chase] You wanna come with?

351
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:52,282
- No, just, fine.

352
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:53,718
We'll wait here.

353
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:57,548
Chase wait, just come back here.

354
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:00,073
- [Chase] Now you want me.

355
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:06,906
Okay.

356
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,012
Hello?

357
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:34,890
Okay.

358
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:40,287
[Door bangs]

359
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,072
[Chase sighs]

360
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:50,645
Shit!

361
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:52,647
Woah.

362
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:57,086
Hi. Oh, Jesus.

363
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:01,656
- [Kim] Where is he?

364
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:02,918
- [Amanda] I don't
know he's been gone...

365
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:03,919
[Growling]

366
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,007
Wait.

367
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:09,620
Chase?

368
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:13,581
[Yelling]

369
00:16:13,624 --> 00:16:15,496
[Girls screaming]

370
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,802
[Laughing]

371
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:19,804
- Oh, my, god.

372
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:21,110
Who's the puppy now?

373
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:23,591
- Oh my god! Honestly,
what is that?

374
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:24,984
[Laughing]

375
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:27,464
- You know, we can
leave right now,

376
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:29,249
it's not that big of a deal.

377
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:30,772
You know, we can get home safe,

378
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,949
do something else
instead for the weekend.

379
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,385
- No.

380
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:36,430
- What do you wanna do?

381
00:16:36,473 --> 00:16:37,953
[Chase sighs]

382
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,520
- Let me see that bottle.

383
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:43,089
I'm goin down.

384
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,830
- What are you talking about?

385
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:50,487
I stole the bottle,
I told you to drive,

386
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:52,011
I'm feeling guilty
and I wanna go

387
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:54,230
tell him I'm sorry.

388
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:57,016
- You're stupid.

389
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,844
- Chase, that's
almost kind of sweet,

390
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:02,456
but no, that's not gonna happen.

391
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:03,631
- He's probably
a really nice guy

392
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:05,067
just out camping with his kid.

393
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:08,114
I'll explain that we are
very dumb college kids,

394
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,245
who are very irresponsible,

395
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:10,725
and I'll give him
my insurance info.

396
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:12,509
- You weren't even driving.

397
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,294
- Doesn't matter, I'm sure
he'll take me up on it.

398
00:17:14,337 --> 00:17:15,686
His car's a beater.

399
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,992
- You're not going
down there, okay?

400
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,516
You're just, you're not.

401
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,954
I dunno, let's, like,
watch a movie or something.

402
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:27,698
- Oh that's exciting.

403
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:30,092
I'm going down.

404
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:32,051
You coming with?

405
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,313
- Knock yourself out.

406
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:34,879
- Look, I'll call the
police in the morning

407
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:35,967
and I'll report myself.

408
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:37,012
- [Chase] I'll handle it.

409
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,144
- No! You're not!

410
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:39,884
You're staying.

411
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:41,756
- [Chase] But, you're
not my girlfriend,

412
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,976
so, oh, you can't
tell me what to do.

413
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,111
Unless you wanna
make it official...

414
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:53,159
- You'd let your girlfriend
tell you what to do?

415
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:55,204
- I'm going. Later.

416
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:57,206
[Crickets chirping]

417
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,686
Okay.

418
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:00,775
So, it's a little bit colder
out here than I thought.

419
00:18:00,818 --> 00:18:04,126
But, I am not an idiot,
I brought warmth.

420
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,085
Thanks mom and dad.

421
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:11,177
[Sighs]

422

[Gate creaks]

423
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,664
This is dark.

424
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:25,016
Alright.

425
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:30,718
Where's the water? No water?

426
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:34,374
God, it's like 20
degrees colder down here.

427
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:40,945
So, there are two hot
drunk girls up there,

428
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:44,079
and I'm all the way down here.

429
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:47,300
Yeah, this is stupid.

430
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:49,780
[Twig snapping]

431
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:55,525
Hello?

432
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:58,920
You gotta be kidding me.

433
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:00,313
[Branches breaking]

434
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:02,358

[Laughing]

436
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:07,624
- Oh you scared the puppy.

437
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:09,148
- [Chase] What are you doing?

438
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,061
[Laughing]

439
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:11,367
- You deserve it.

440
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:12,716
- [Chase] Seriously, not funny.

441
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,456
Not out here.

442
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,588
- Oh please.

443
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,982
- [Chase] Okay fine, I
get it, I hate you both.

444
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:19,158
Satisfied?

445
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,464
- Oh, did the little
puppy pee himself?

446
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:22,683
Let me see...

447
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:23,858
- [Chase] You're lucky
I didn't attack you,

448
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:25,033
I thought you were
a bear or something.

449
00:19:26,077 --> 00:19:27,688
- So can puppies attack bears?

450
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:28,689
Cause I didn't know that.

451
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:30,212
- I didn't know that either.

452
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,431
[Laughing]

453
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:32,301
- [Chase] Did you come
out here to harass me,

454
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:33,520
or was there something else?

455
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:35,304
- No, we got scared,
that house is creepy.

456
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:39,395
This looks like
fun, what's goin on?

457
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:42,050
- And we're just a
teeny little bit drunk,

458
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:44,226
so we figured, what the
hell, we'll come out here,

459
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,881
and protect him from
the big mountain man.

460
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:49,449
- [Chase] Okay, fine, let's go.

461
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:52,016
Try not to be so loud
when we get closer,

462
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,104
it's a little dark out here.

463
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:55,194
- [Kim] Oh, okay, shh shh shhhh.

464
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:57,674
[Girls laughing]

465
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:02,984
- Sure you're cool
with that thing?

466
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:05,639
- [Kim] Uh, yeah,
I'm not an idiot.

467
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:07,293
- Two hands.

468
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,993
Shine it over here.

469
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:17,433
We're gonna have to
cross this thing.

470
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:20,741
- [Kim] Why is
there a fence here?

471
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:22,221
- [Chase] To keep people out.

472
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:24,527
- [Kim] Out of what?

473
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,096
- Probably not the best
time to get into this.

474
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:29,315
Don't worry about it.

475
00:20:30,968 --> 00:20:32,622
No one ever really
comes back here,

476
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,624
you're not supposed to cross
the other side of this.

477
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:35,973
- Why is that?

478
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:39,455
- It's nothin, come on.

479
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,593
- What are they trying
to keep us out of?

480
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:50,336
- These back-country folks,
just a tad uneducated,

481
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:53,121
you know, a little
superstitious.

482
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:55,079
- Of what?

483
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:56,603
- Just, come on, it's nothin.

484
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:58,431
Don't worry about
it, Kim, come on.

485
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:01,956
My biceps of steel
are slowly giving way.

486
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,527
- [Kim] Ugh, we've
been walking forever.

487
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,441
- It's been like ten minutes,

488
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:09,703
we'll know how close we are once

489
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,182
we get to the top of this hill.

490
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:13,576
- [Kim] Have you ever
been out here before?

491
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,927
- No, not past the fence.
Especially at night.

492
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:19,365
- That's comforting.

493
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:23,717
- [Kim] So, there
aren't like any

494
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,285
wild animals out
here, are there?

495
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:29,853
- No, they cleared all
of the wolves and coyotes

496
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:32,160
years ago when they made
this a nature preserve.

497
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:34,423
- [Kim] Really?
- No, but you're cute.

498
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:38,645
- [Kim] You're telling
me that there are

499
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:41,691
actual wild animals
on the loose out here?

500
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:43,171
- Of course there
are but the less

501
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:44,694
noise you make, the better.

502
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:46,957
We're not gonna be
attacked by anything

503
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:48,089
as long as we don't
draw attention

504
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:49,308
to ourselves we'll be fine.

505
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:52,963
Oh, and watch out
for snakes too.

506
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:55,879
- That's a joke, right?

507
00:21:56,663 --> 00:21:57,490
Right?

508
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:59,013
- Come on.

509
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:00,449
[Kim sighs]

510
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:09,023
- [Kim] You gonna let your
girl walk all alone back there?

511
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:11,155
- [Chase] I thought you
said she was bad news.

512
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,809
- [Amanda] I can hear you.

513
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,551
- I know, just playing.

514
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:20,295
- [Amanda] Is it bad,
now that I'm sobering up,

515
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,080
starting to think we're really
stupid for being out here.

516
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:25,431
- We're fine, only like
a mile from the house.

517
00:22:25,474 --> 00:22:27,128
- [Amanda] I thought you
said it was less than a mile.

518
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:30,392
- I was guesstimating, I think
we're a lot closer though.

519
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:31,741
[Kim screams]

520
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,352
Shh! You're gonna
wake the bears!

521
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,876
- Don't do that.
- [Amanda] Guys, seriously.

522
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:40,794
- Can I see it?

523
00:22:40,837 --> 00:22:42,012
- [Chase] You just had it.

524
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:43,710
- Yeah, I know, but it
makes me feel better.

525
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:46,582
Like I'm watching
a movie instead of

526
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:49,063
walking through Sherwood
forest at two am.

527
00:22:50,194 --> 00:22:51,370
- [Chase] Here.

528
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:01,336
Did you do that?

529
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,598
- [Amanda] No...

530
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:05,209
- [Kim] Don't look at me.

531
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:11,433
- Shit. It's a camera.

532
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:13,609
- Hey, a what?

533
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:17,700
- Must be set up
for trespassers.

534
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:19,398
- [Kim] For trespassing what?

535
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:22,531
- I told you, it's
a nature preserve.

536
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:24,968
Probably just some sort of
tracking device or something.

537
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:26,579
To snap pictures of trespassers.

538
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:27,797
- Good, awesome,
that's just one more

539
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:29,233
reason I'm gonna be arrested.

540
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:32,323
- [Kim] Why is this a
nature preserve again?

541
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:36,284
- It's a kinda historical
landmark, sort of.

542
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,113
- [Kim] For what?

543
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:42,943
- The native people
lived out here

544
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:45,032
a couple hundred years ago,

545
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:46,990
I guess this is like
an old burial ground,

546
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:49,602
I don't know, the locals
are weird about it.

547
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:50,907
So they made it a preserve.
- [Amanda] What, you mean

548
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:52,343
like a giant graveyard?

549
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,433
- Well, when you
put it that way.

550
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,043
- So you brought us out
in the middle of the night

551
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:57,914
to walk through some
Indian cemetery.

552
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:01,135
- No, I didn't. I
came out here alone.

553
00:24:01,178 --> 00:24:04,138
And it's not like a cemetery,
it's more of a burial ground.

554
00:24:04,181 --> 00:24:06,009
Which is why they
made it a preserve.

555
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:08,882
Don't worry about it,
they're all dead anyway.

556
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:11,101
- [Kim] You really know
how to comfort, don't you?

557
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:13,887
- Either way, I think
we're almost through it,

558
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,845
which means we're
almost to the campsite.

559
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:17,934
Plus, we haven't been attacked

560
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:19,893
by any evil spirits yet, right?

561
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:24,288
That was a joke,
everybody just relax.

562
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,813
- Okay wait, how
do you know they're

563
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,554
not just camping
on the preserve?

564
00:24:29,337 --> 00:24:31,034
- I told you, the locals
are weird about it.

565
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:32,253
I don't think that guy would

566
00:24:32,296 --> 00:24:34,037
bring his little girl out here.

567
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:35,474
- [Kim] Okay...

568
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,129
- Listen, we'll just
go talk to this guy,

569
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:42,263
and see if we can't salvage
what's left of the night.

570
00:24:42,306 --> 00:24:43,525
Okay?

571
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:47,224
Don't act like I
kept this from you.

572
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:48,878
I didn't even think about it.

573
00:24:48,922 --> 00:24:51,098
And who cares if it
was a burial ground?

574
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:52,621
What does that even mean to you?

575
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,102
- Let's just get this over with.

576
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:57,800
[Chase sighs]

577
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:00,499
- Amanda.

578
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:10,117
- [Amanda] I think it
came from that direction.

579
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,423
- [Chase] Just wait,
see if we hear it again.

580
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:26,133
[Yelling]

581
00:25:28,483 --> 00:25:29,789
- I heard that.

582
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:34,968
Chase?

583
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:36,273
- [Chase] I don't know.

584
00:25:37,797 --> 00:25:39,320
- You think maybe
it was an animal

585
00:25:39,363 --> 00:25:41,148
or something, like a deer?

586
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:43,585
- [Chase] Didn't sound like
any animal I've ever heard.

587
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:48,808
- Maybe it just, we're
close to the campsite?

588
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:50,374
- [Chase] Did that
sound human to you?

589
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:51,985
- [Kim] I don't know.

590
00:25:56,946 --> 00:25:58,905
- Okay, I'm really freaked
out, can we go back?

591
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:01,081
- [Chase] Just wait.

592
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:03,823
Let's get to the
top of this hill.

593
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:04,998
Maybe Kim is right it could be

594
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:06,260
right over that crest out there.

595
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:08,305
- You just said it
didn't sound like that.

596
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:11,700
- [Chase] Just give
it another minute.

597
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:20,056
- [Kim] God, it's
quiet out here.

598
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:24,583
I really wish you didn't tell us

599
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,410
what we're sitting in right now.

600
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:29,152
- [Chase] It's just
messing with your head,

601
00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:31,851
come on, once we clear
through these trees,

602
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:33,504
we'll be able to see
them from that hill.

603
00:26:34,505 --> 00:26:36,029
- You better be right.

604
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:37,378
- [Chase] I'm always right.

605
00:26:38,858 --> 00:26:42,122
Amanda, can you say
hi? Maybe smile for us?

606
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:45,168
Good enough.

607
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:47,997
Kim, anything for posterity?

608
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,433
- I have to pee.

609
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:50,739
- [Chase] Excellent.

610
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,873
- [Amanda] What are they doing?

611
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:55,788
- [Chase] Can't tell,
it's just the guy.

612
00:26:58,051 --> 00:26:59,661
- [Kim] Where's the little girl?

613
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,184
- [Chase] I dunno.

614
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:09,105
- Maybe we should come back and
talk to them in the morning?

615
00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:11,064
When it's not this creepy.

616
00:27:11,107 --> 00:27:13,240
I'm sure they'll still be here.

617
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:15,590
- [Chase] Do you realize how
far we are from the house?

618
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,114
We're almost there.

619
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:19,638
You're not gonna be able
to relax until we fix this.

620
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:20,464
Come on.

621
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:22,902
- No, no I don't think so.

622
00:27:25,165 --> 00:27:28,298
- [Chase] Okay. Then be careful.

623
00:27:31,737 --> 00:27:33,913
All we need to do is
go down this hill,

624
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:35,044
cross through this valley,

625
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:36,176
once we get to the
top of that hill,

626
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:38,091
we're there, ten minutes Max.

627
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:45,968
Okay, be careful walking
back through the cemetery.

628
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:49,972
- You're such an asshole.

629
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:51,234
- [Chase] Oh, come on.

630
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:52,409
- Fine.

631
00:27:58,154 --> 00:28:00,069
- [Chase] Wow, these guys
are serious about this huh?

632
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:03,420
- Do you think that's why
he parked on the other side?

633
00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:04,987
Because he didn't
wanna pass through?

634
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:06,554
- [Chase] Maybe.

635
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:10,036
- What if he followed us
out here because I hit him?

636
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:12,516
I mean, what are the chances
that he parks facing us?

637
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,257
- [Chase] You're
overanalyzing this Amanda.

638
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:18,087
Come on, I'll do the talking.

639
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:21,656
I can handle this, trust me.

640
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:26,922
- [Amanda] Is this it?

641
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:29,664
- [Chase] Yeah. It was.

642
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:33,799
- [Amanda] Chase,
what are you doing?

643
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:36,410
- [Kim] Okay this is,
this is too weird.

644
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:39,500
He obviously doesn't
wanna see us.

645
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:41,458
- [Chase] He doesn't
even know who we are.

646
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:43,547
- I'm pretty sure
he knows it's us.

647
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:47,029
- [Chase] In a matter
of only four minutes,

648
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:49,031
they packed up and disappeared?

649
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:52,339
- Okay, I'm officially
freaked out, can we go now?

650
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:56,125
- [Chase] So what, he
saw us, why is that bad?

651
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:11,837
Oh, what?

652
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:13,926
Amanda.

653
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:15,405
- [Amanda] What?

654
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,150
God, is that hair?

655
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:22,586
- [Chase] Yeah.

656
00:29:28,897 --> 00:29:30,203
- [Amanda] Let me see that.

657
00:29:33,162 --> 00:29:35,121
Oh my god.

658
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:37,079
Chase, this is
that little girl's.

659
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:41,780
You don't think that's her hair?

660
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,262
[Kim yells]

661
00:29:46,306 --> 00:29:47,568
- [Amanda] What?

662
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:50,092
- [Chase] Kim?

663
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,662
- [Amanda] Kim?

664
00:29:59,406 --> 00:30:00,668
- What is this?

665
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,845
- You shouldn't have brought it.

666
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:06,108
Any of it, it just
doesn't make sense.

667
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:07,718
Why would you feel the
need to bring that shit?

668
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:09,851
- I wasn't gonna leave
it, chase, it's evidence.

669
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:10,896
- Evidence of what?

670
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:12,419
We didn't even see anything.

671
00:30:12,462 --> 00:30:14,682
- Between the hair,
the bloody dress,

672
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:16,118
what do you think he
was doing out there?

673
00:30:16,162 --> 00:30:18,077
- I don't give a shit what
he was doing out there.

674
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,166
We should've left
their stuff there.

675
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,515
You think he went home?

676
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:23,256
He knew you were
coming and he hid,

677
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:24,866
now you've got some
fucked up bloody dress,

678
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,302
and he's gonna want it back.

679
00:30:26,346 --> 00:30:28,000
- He wouldn't have left
if he knew we were coming.

680
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:29,871
- Oh, so you think he
just decided to leave

681
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:31,046
in the middle of the
night for no good reason,

682
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,178
just before we got there?

683
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:34,528
- [Kim] Maybe he
wanted us to find it.

684
00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:38,532
- Tell me you didn't
bring the other stuff.

685
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,405
You took the bow?
- [Amanda] Yes!

686
00:30:42,449 --> 00:30:43,145
- And the hair?

687
00:30:43,189 --> 00:30:44,668
- I brought all of it!

688
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:45,756
What did you want to do chase?

689
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,193
It's covered in blood.

690
00:30:47,236 --> 00:30:48,977
- So what are you gonna do?

691
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:52,546
- Call the police, tell
them what we found.

692
00:30:53,373 --> 00:30:54,461
- Ugh.

693
00:30:56,115 --> 00:30:57,159
This is how this stuff starts,

694
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:58,857
this has nothing to do with us.

695
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,423
- [Kim] This had
nothing to do with us,

696
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:02,991
until you insisted
we come out here.

697
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:04,732
- Thank you.

698
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:05,907
- [Kim] And Amanda?

699
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:07,082
How do you expect
to call the police

700
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:08,823
if we don't have any service?

701
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:11,565
- We'll go in the morning.

702
00:31:13,175 --> 00:31:15,003
- [Kim] I feel like
he saw us, like,

703
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:16,787
he could've been watching.

704
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:20,008
- We need to put it back.

705
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:21,270
- [Amanda] No.

706
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:22,097
- Amanda.

707
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:23,490
- No!

708
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:24,752
What are you gonna do chase?

709
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:26,014
You want to come
take it from me?

710
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:29,191
This has a little girl's blood,

711
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:32,238
I'm not leaving it behind.

712
00:31:34,196 --> 00:31:36,024
I don't care what happens next.

713
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:38,940
- Fine!

714
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,117
Then we need to keep
moving, give me this.

715
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:44,511
- [Amanda] Could you shine
the light this way please?

716
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:45,599
It's really dark.

717
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:46,948
- [Kim] This is
really bad Amanda,

718
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:48,558
this is really bad, I
really hope you know that.

719
00:31:56,697 --> 00:31:58,133
- I don't know.

720
00:31:58,177 --> 00:31:59,439
They saw the girl,
what are the chances

721
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:01,223
he just randomly parked there?

722
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:05,793
- Why wouldn't Tooley
just go to the house?

723
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:07,447
Why did he park a mile away?

724
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,972
- Maybe he knows the perfect
place to Bury a body.

725
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:14,933
- Wait, we have to
fast-forward through this

726
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:15,977
and get to the meat of it.

727
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:18,023
We still have two
kids out there.

728
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:20,590
- We got this off the
kid in interrogation one.

729
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:28,772
I think we're gonna
find that Levenger

730
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:30,731
kid's body out in the preserve.

731
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:33,995
We're gonna have
to watch all of it,

732
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,518
I'm gonna put on another pot.

733
00:32:39,696 --> 00:32:43,265
- Has Katie's priest
seen our hunter, Tooley?

734
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:46,138
- Yeah, father
Gallagher said that he

735
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:48,923
hadn't seen him in a
while but he did see him

736
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,273
milling about the school
the day she was taken.

737
00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:53,101
- And he got a good look at him?

738
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:54,581
I mean, you trust his account?

739
00:32:54,624 --> 00:32:56,061
- Yeah, very specific.

740
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:59,325
He's been in town a long
time, knows a lot of people.

741
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:02,937
He actually just baptised
my little girl last week.

742
00:33:04,112 --> 00:33:06,027
- My kids go to Saint Mary's.

743
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:07,594
Father's a sharp guy.

744
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:09,552
- The custodian?

745
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:11,859
- He also said that
he was certain.

746
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,167
- Let's watch this, come on.

747
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,521
- [Amanda] No,
seriously, I can't see.

748
00:33:23,131 --> 00:33:24,045
- What's wrong?

749
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:24,828
- I dunno.

750
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:25,481
[Tape fast-forwarding]

751
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:26,526
We have audio.

752
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:32,010
- [Kim] We didn't
come this way before.

753
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:35,013
- Stop messing with that thing
and keep the light going.

754
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:37,058
I can't see.

755
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:41,149
- [Chase] We're fine, if
we follow this river bed,

756
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:43,325
it'll keep us from getting lost.

757
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:46,067
- [Kim] Well, what if the
light goes out on the camera?

758
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:47,982
- I put a fresh battery in,

759
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,331
before we came down.

760
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:54,162
- [Kim] You guys
think that there's,

761
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:58,079
any way that this whole
thing isn't what it seems?

762
00:33:58,123 --> 00:34:01,474
Like maybe her dress
has catsup on it?

763
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:03,867
From her dinner and she...

764
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,262
And she maybe, you
know, just changed.

765
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:09,134
And then the bow fell
off her head, and then...

766
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:11,832
- Catsup, really?

767
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:17,838
What are you doing? Come on.

768
00:34:19,709 --> 00:34:20,971
- [Kim] What is it?

769
00:34:23,844 --> 00:34:24,758
- [Amanda] Chase?

770
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,717
You're being really
weird, what are you doing?

771
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:34,202
- Check it out.

772
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,944
[Urinating]

773
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:38,119
It's a sprinkler.

774
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:39,903
- [Kim] Come on!

775
00:34:41,818 --> 00:34:44,125
- You couldn't wait? Really?

776
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:46,127
- You gotta go, go,
don't make me hold it,

777
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:47,302
I've been drinking all night.

778
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:49,652
- [Kim] Fine, just
hurry, please.

779
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,046
- Are you done?

780
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,091
[Chase sighs]

781
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:54,875
[Zipping]

782
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:02,012
- Did you see that?

783
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:04,537
- [Kim] See what?

784
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:12,675
- [Amanda] Chase, really?

785
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:18,116
- You guys didn't see?

786
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:21,597
- [Amanda] Chase,
we're all even, okay?

787
00:35:21,641 --> 00:35:24,165
Stop it, this is not
a time to mess around.

788
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:25,340
- [Chase] I'm not
messing around.

789
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:27,429
- [Kim] Chase,
just, let's just go,

790
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:29,127
who cares what's in there?

791
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:34,262
- [Chase] Hold on.

792
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:37,091
- Do you understand how
annoying you're being?

793
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,919
God!

794
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:40,529
[Rustling]

795
00:35:40,573 --> 00:35:42,357
- [Kim] What was that?

796
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:45,186
Amanda wait!
- [Amanda] Chase, come on!

797
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,188
- [Kim] Wait, I saw someone.

798
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:48,711
- [Amanda] What?

799
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:50,191
- [Kim] I think I saw someone.

800
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:52,411
- Chase is just trying
to be funny. Chase?

801
00:35:52,454 --> 00:35:53,760
We're gonna leave you here!
- [Kim] Amanda! Amanda!

802
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:55,544
There was someone
standing right there,

803
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:59,026
I saw an arm and it reached out.

804
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:01,202
Someone was standing
right in front of him,

805
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:03,073
oh god, it was
standing right there.

806
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:04,988
- Kim! Stop okay,
stop fucking around!

807
00:36:05,815 --> 00:36:07,469
- [Kim] Oh my god, Amanda.

808
00:36:08,992 --> 00:36:10,385
Someone followed us out here,

809
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:12,126
someone's watching us.

810
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:17,000
It's the guy, we have to go!
- Stop it!

811
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:18,001
Stop, you're freaking me out!

812
00:36:18,045 --> 00:36:19,177
We can't just leave him here!

813
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,048
- [Kim] No, Amanda,
there was someone

814
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:22,484
standing right there, I swear.

815
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:24,007
- What, he just reached
out there and grabbed him?

816
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:25,705
- [Kim] Yes! Let's go!
- He didn't even make a sound!

817
00:36:25,748 --> 00:36:27,881
Don't you think he would've
screamed or something?

818
00:36:27,924 --> 00:36:30,057
No, he's gonna pop
out any second now!

819
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,973
- [Kim] No he isn't
Amanda, let's go!

820
00:36:33,016 --> 00:36:34,975
- [Amanda] Chase?
- [Kim] Amanda, don't!

821
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:38,631
- Chase, please, god, we
have to go back to the house!

822
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:40,285
- [Kim] Let's go!

823
00:36:40,328 --> 00:36:42,896
- Chase, please.

824
00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:44,767
I am asking you.

825
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:49,990
- [Kim] Amanda, I don't
think we're alone.

826
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:56,039
Come on, you know, we can,

827
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,519
we can go back to the
house and we can get help

828
00:36:57,563 --> 00:36:58,955
and then we can come back
out here and look for him.

829
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:00,479
Please, Amanda, please.

830
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:02,394
- Maybe if we turn on the
night vision we can see him?

831
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:03,873
- [Kim] Okay fine, just hurry.

832
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:05,658
- I don't know how to do
it, how do you do this?

833
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:06,920
God, I can't find
it, can you do it?

834
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:09,488
- [Kim] Here, here. There.

835
00:37:13,187 --> 00:37:14,710
[Gasping]

836
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:16,538
Oh god, go! Go!

837
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:21,674
- Go, don't stop, just go!

838
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:29,943
[Heavy breathing]

839
00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:31,205
Keep going okay.

840
00:37:33,163 --> 00:37:35,253
Go ahead, keep going.

841
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,651
Oh my god! Oh my god!

842
00:37:42,695 --> 00:37:44,262
- [Kim] Come here, come here.

843
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:46,786
[Heavy breathing]

844
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:53,880
Come here.

845
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:57,666
Do you see any more?

846
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:03,237
I think it's this...

847
00:38:09,243 --> 00:38:10,113
Don't you think maybe we're

848
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:12,202
drawing attention to ourselves?

849
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:14,335
- [Amanda] What are
we supposed to do?

850
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:16,598
Whatever's out there is
staring at us right now.

851
00:38:17,817 --> 00:38:20,167
Oh god, how many
of them are there?

852
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,430
- I don't know, like
ten, maybe more.

853
00:38:26,434 --> 00:38:29,132
We have to get
back to the house.

854
00:38:29,176 --> 00:38:31,178
- [Amanda] Okay,
let's keep moving.

855
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:32,440

856
00:38:32,484 --> 00:38:35,313
Shh. Shh.

857
00:38:39,926 --> 00:38:42,842
[Twigs breaking]

858
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:45,323
[Rustling]

859
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:54,593
- They're everywhere. No.

860
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:56,029
- [Amanda] Where's the
switch, flip the switch.

861
00:38:56,072 --> 00:38:58,118
Kim, flip the switch!

862
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:01,164
Kim, come on, come on.

863

865
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:17,442
- Shit, there's some more.

866
00:39:23,012 --> 00:39:24,274
- [Kim] We should run.

867
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:25,972
- [Amanda] No, we can't,
they're everywhere.

868
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:29,410
[Howling]

869
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:35,111
- Here.

870
00:39:40,116 --> 00:39:42,162
Go on! Leave us alone!

871
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:45,121
Go! Go away!

872
00:39:46,862 --> 00:39:48,995
Leave us alone!

873
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:51,214
Go, shoo!

874
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:53,434
- [Kim] It's working,
it's working.

875
00:39:53,478 --> 00:39:55,001
[Hitting sticks together]

876
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:14,847
I haven't heard anything
in a couple of minutes.

877
00:40:16,022 --> 00:40:18,067
- I think they're gone.

878
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:20,418
- Yeah, or they're just
quietly surrounding us again.

879
00:40:23,116 --> 00:40:24,247
- You could be right.

880
00:40:25,205 --> 00:40:26,598
Let's go.

881
00:40:29,035 --> 00:40:31,080
Kim, slow down, you're
gonna wear yourself out.

882
00:40:31,124 --> 00:40:32,299
- Well, then you need to hurry,

883
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:34,388
because I refuse to be
out here any longer.

884
00:40:35,258 --> 00:40:39,001
Too young and too pretty to
die in the fucking woods.

885
00:40:39,045 --> 00:40:40,568
[Kim yells, water splashing]

886
00:40:40,612 --> 00:40:43,441
- Kim! Kim!

887
00:40:44,572 --> 00:40:47,357
Kim! Kim!

888
00:40:50,796 --> 00:40:52,580
[Water splashing]

889
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,367
Kim? Kim!

890

[Crying]

891
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:05,158
[Screams]

892
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:06,899
Oh my god, oh my god.

893
00:41:06,942 --> 00:41:09,467
[Both crying]

894
00:41:25,134 --> 00:41:26,701
You're freezing.

895
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:28,137
[Coughing]

896
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:29,965
[Gasping]

897
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,841
Oh my god.

898
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,758
- There's something really

899
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:41,977
really wrong with this place.

900
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:46,199
- We should go.
Let's go, let's go.

901
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:54,555
- [Kim] Can you set the
light up behind you?

902
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,122
- [Amanda] Figure this out...

903
00:41:56,165 --> 00:41:58,080
[Water dripping]

904
00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:14,532
- You know, we could be on
a beach somewhere right now?

905
00:42:15,794 --> 00:42:17,839
That's where people go.

906
00:42:19,145 --> 00:42:21,060
They go to happy places, Amanda.

907
00:42:22,888 --> 00:42:24,063
This isn't a happy place.

908
00:42:25,064 --> 00:42:26,631
- Yeah, I know that.

909
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,113
- Did you know that Adam Woodson

910
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:33,507
was trying to get
me to go to that

911
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,248
resort we went to last year?

912
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:38,251
- So why didn't you go?

913
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:41,341
- Because I thought
it would be more fun

914
00:42:41,384 --> 00:42:43,256
to run for my life in the woods.

915
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:48,217
Why are we here?

916
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:52,047
- What, I didn't want
to wait at the house

917
00:42:52,091 --> 00:42:53,092
while chase was out
here by himself.

918
00:42:53,135 --> 00:42:55,311
- No no, in the boonies?

919
00:42:55,355 --> 00:42:57,226
Here in general?

920
00:42:58,837 --> 00:42:59,794
You had to put in more time to

921
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:01,143
keep chase pining for you?

922
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:03,058
- What?

923
00:43:04,233 --> 00:43:06,888
No, I'm sorry Kim,
do you want him?

924
00:43:06,932 --> 00:43:09,195
Because it's pretty apparent
that you're begging for it.

925
00:43:09,238 --> 00:43:10,544
[Kim laughs]

926
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,199
- If I wanted him, I
could have him, trust me.

927
00:43:13,242 --> 00:43:16,071
- Okay, so then it's because
you think that I might?

928
00:43:17,986 --> 00:43:18,987
- I'm not doing this right now.

929
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:20,598
- No, please, let's.

930
00:43:22,295 --> 00:43:24,210
- You don't even
know him that well.

931
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,736
How do you know that he
isn't hiding in the bushes

932
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:31,043
watching us and
laughing his ass off?

933
00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:36,004
- No, he wouldn't do that.

934
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:37,658
- Pfft, no?

935
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:42,968
You need to not be so
trusting of people Amanda.

936
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:45,144
You know, I know that you think

937
00:43:45,187 --> 00:43:47,494
they're all like
innocent little puppies,

938
00:43:47,537 --> 00:43:49,583
but they could end
up surprising you.

939
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:53,021
- You know what, I
hope you're right.

940
00:43:53,065 --> 00:43:54,980
I hope he is hiding,
because that would mean

941
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:57,591
that he's okay and
then we'd be okay.

942
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,114
- No it doesn't.

943
00:44:02,204 --> 00:44:04,119
This isn't gonna get any
better, it's too late.

944
00:44:04,163 --> 00:44:05,730
- What, that's my fault?

945
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:07,166
- Oh, well it isn't?

946
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,212
Awesome. Put the dress
down and let's go home.

947
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:13,433
- I can't do that.

948
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:18,481
Fine, whatever, I guess,
yeah, it's too late.

949
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:19,569
- Let's go.

950
00:44:19,613 --> 00:44:20,527
- No.

951
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:23,312
One day this is
gonna mean something.

952
00:44:23,356 --> 00:44:25,184
I don't know what, it's...

953
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,448
It'll make a difference.

954
00:44:29,971 --> 00:44:31,103
It has to.

955
00:44:31,146 --> 00:44:32,800
- God, what's the point?

956
00:44:32,844 --> 00:44:34,236
The dress is ripped
to shreds anyway.

957
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,890
- Okay, we should go.

958
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,372
Let's go.

959
00:44:39,415 --> 00:44:40,678
- Fine.

960
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:45,073
Don't forget all the pieces
of your precious dress.

961
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:48,642
Why do we seem so far away?

962
00:44:50,165 --> 00:44:51,950
- I don't know, we've been
walking the right direction,

963
00:44:51,993 --> 00:44:53,168
I just...

964
00:44:53,778 --> 00:44:55,867
God, I don't remember
it being this far.

965
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,303
- [Kim] Neither do I.

966
00:44:58,783 --> 00:45:00,828
- Yeah. How's the battery?

967
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:03,526
- [Kim] Still have half left.

968
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:07,922
- Okay, yeah, let's keep
the light going then.

969
00:45:09,968 --> 00:45:11,752
- [Kim] You know,
maybe if we just walk

970
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:12,840
in as straight a
line as possible.

971
00:45:12,884 --> 00:45:14,102
[Screams]

972
00:45:14,146 --> 00:45:15,408
What was that?

973
00:45:19,064 --> 00:45:22,763
- I don't know, I think, I
think that's just the wind.

974
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:40,694
- Can you shine it over here?

975
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,652
I don't wanna rip my
shirt on the branches.

976
00:45:45,177 --> 00:45:47,745
What? I already lost my hat.

977
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,965
- [Amanda] Do you smell that?

978
00:45:51,009 --> 00:45:52,750
- No.

979
00:45:52,793 --> 00:45:56,144
- [Amanda] It smells like,
burning hair or something.

980
00:46:00,148 --> 00:46:01,541
- I don't smell anything.

981
00:46:03,108 --> 00:46:04,762
- [Amanda] No, it really smells
like something's burning.

Here Kim, take this.

992
00:46:35,575 --> 00:46:37,446
- [Kim] No, Amanda.

993
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,361
Amanda, you can't go in there.

994
00:46:40,362 --> 00:46:42,321

Oh my god, we have to help her.

- [Kim] No, I’m
not going in there

998
00:46:49,545 --> 00:46:50,808
and you're not going in there,

999
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:52,853
she has to come out here.

1000

we can help you, okay?

out, we're gonna go get help

1004
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:06,736
and then we'll
come back, alright?

fine, just come out

Oh my god Kim, we
have to go in there.

inside those bushes.

- Here, give me the flashlight.

giving it to you.

[Yelling]

1016
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:29,020
- She could be dying,
what if this is hers?

1017
00:47:29,934 --> 00:47:31,413
- [Kim] It doesn't sound
like a little girl.

1018
00:47:31,457 --> 00:47:33,285
- Does that sound fake?

1019
00:47:33,328 --> 00:47:35,026
Give me the flashlight.

1020
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:37,637
- [Kim] Fine, but
it barely works.

1021

Please don't do this.

1022

back and she was dead?

How would you feel?

1024
00:47:46,254 --> 00:47:47,777
- [Kim] What about me?

1025
00:47:49,954 --> 00:47:53,044
- We'll be fine, she's
hurt, she can't do anything.

1026
00:48:01,356 --> 00:48:05,143

we're dealing with here,

there's got to be more to see.

00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,999
- [Rooney] Female?

1058
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,567
Come on.

1059
00:51:46,712 --> 00:51:48,105
- There's one more tape.

1060
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:51,369
Could be more darkness.

1061
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,552
- [Rooney] Woah,
woah, wait wait wait.

1062
00:52:23,401 --> 00:52:25,011
[Gasping]

1063
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,884
- [Chase] Relax, relax.

1064
00:52:28,928 --> 00:52:30,625
- Chase?
- [Chase] Yeah.

1065
00:52:30,669 --> 00:52:32,105
Are you okay?

1066
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,153
- Ah. I don't know.

1067
00:52:39,112 --> 00:52:41,114
- [Chase] Are you hurt?

1068
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,508
- I don't know,
I don't think so.

1069
00:52:45,945 --> 00:52:47,381
What happened to you?

1070
00:52:52,647 --> 00:52:53,866
[Rustling]

1071
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:55,172
- [Chase] Did you hear that?

1072
00:52:57,348 --> 00:52:58,697
- [Kim] What is it?

1073
00:53:00,612 --> 00:53:02,179
- [Chase] Who's there?

1074
00:53:02,222 --> 00:53:04,529
[Footsteps]

1075
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:12,798
- [Kim] Oh my god. Oh my god.

1076
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,631
Honey, oh my god, are you okay?

1077
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:24,940
- [Chase] Are you
hurt, are you hurt?

1078
00:53:24,984 --> 00:53:25,985
- I don't know.

1079
00:53:26,028 --> 00:53:26,812
- What happened to you?

1080
00:53:26,855 --> 00:53:28,422
- [Chase] Are you okay?

1081
00:53:28,466 --> 00:53:29,728
- I couldn't see, I don't know,

1082
00:53:29,771 --> 00:53:31,425
something grabbed me and then,

1083
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:33,819
I don't know.

1084
00:53:35,168 --> 00:53:37,170
- Was it a woman?

1085
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,867
- I couldn't see, it was
really strong though,

1086
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:42,131
I tried to fight
but, I don't know,

1087
00:53:42,175 --> 00:53:44,046
I must've blacked
out or something.

1088
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:45,613
- [Chase] Are you hurt?

1089
00:53:45,657 --> 00:53:47,136
- I don't think so.

1090
00:53:48,442 --> 00:53:50,575
My sweater's gone though.

1091
00:53:50,618 --> 00:53:52,794
- Where did you wake up?

1092
00:53:52,838 --> 00:53:55,928
- I woke up in this
field and I just,

1093
00:53:55,971 --> 00:53:57,756
I started running.

1094
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:02,587
Oh my god, oh.

1095
00:54:03,936 --> 00:54:05,503
- [Chase] Oh.

1096
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:08,897
- Oh my god, what happened?

1097
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:10,508
- [Chase] Relax, relax.

1098
00:54:10,551 --> 00:54:12,727
- What happened?

1099
00:54:12,771 --> 00:54:14,381
[Crying]

1100
00:54:16,165 --> 00:54:18,342
You still haven't told
us where you went.

1101
00:54:18,385 --> 00:54:20,300
- Is that thing on? I
don't see the red light.

1102
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:22,041
- [Kim] Yeah, it's recording.

1103
00:54:22,084 --> 00:54:24,478
What is it? How come you
haven't told us what happened?

1104
00:54:24,522 --> 00:54:25,697
- I'm not gonna tell you.

1105
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:26,915
- Yes you are.

1106
00:54:26,959 --> 00:54:29,091
- No, I'm gonna show you.

1107
00:54:30,528 --> 00:54:32,530
- Chase please,
please, please, please.

1108
00:54:32,573 --> 00:54:34,836
We have to go back, please.

1109
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,316
- We're not going
back to the house.

1110
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,275
- [Kim] Why not?

1111
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:39,885
- Because I don't really
know where it is right now.

1112
00:54:39,928 --> 00:54:41,539
We've wandered too
far off course.

1113
00:54:42,627 --> 00:54:44,411
We're going somewhere else.

1114
00:54:44,455 --> 00:54:45,717
I have to show you something.

1115
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,674
- Chase.

1116
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,156
- I still don't completely
believe it myself,

1117
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:54,813
but it's real, all of it, and
it's gonna blow your mind.

1118
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:57,206
No no no no, keep rolling.

1119
00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:00,122
We shoot everything. All of it.

1120
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,994
- What are you getting at?

1121
00:55:02,037 --> 00:55:05,127
- All of this, as bad
as it is right now,

1122
00:55:06,085 --> 00:55:07,565
is gonna be worth something.

1123
00:55:08,914 --> 00:55:11,220
Especially after I
show you what I've got.

1124
00:55:11,264 --> 00:55:12,831
- What happened?

1125
00:55:14,789 --> 00:55:17,183
- There's something
living out here.

1126
00:55:18,837 --> 00:55:20,360
[Hisses]

1127
00:55:23,145 --> 00:55:24,364
Shit.

1128
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:25,974
- [Kim] Seriously, chase.

1129
00:55:27,498 --> 00:55:28,803
Just tell us what
happened to you,

1130
00:55:28,847 --> 00:55:30,196
what's living out here?

1131
00:55:32,851 --> 00:55:33,895
- You first.

1132
00:55:33,939 --> 00:55:35,288
- [Kim] I told you I don't know.

1133
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:38,987
- Well you have to
remember something,

1134
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:40,032
what do you remember?

1135
00:55:41,512 --> 00:55:43,688
- [Kim] Something chasing
me, like from the bushes,

1136
00:55:43,731 --> 00:55:46,081
I don't know, I just
remember getting hit.

1137
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:48,040
I didn't see anything.

1138
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:48,954
- I did.

1139
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:50,912
- What did you see?

1140
00:55:50,956 --> 00:55:53,219
- I woke up and it was
looking right down at me.

1141
00:55:53,262 --> 00:55:54,220
- [Amanda] It?

1142
00:55:54,263 --> 00:55:55,482
- Yeah, it.

1143
00:55:56,004 --> 00:55:56,962
It was looking right down at me,

1144
00:55:57,005 --> 00:55:58,703
thought I was still out.

1145
00:55:58,746 --> 00:55:59,965
- [Kim] Where?

1146
00:56:01,053 --> 00:56:02,533
- When I was looking
in the bushes,

1147
00:56:02,576 --> 00:56:04,883
I saw a hand, it looked limp,

1148
00:56:04,926 --> 00:56:06,972
so I thought maybe it
was like a dead body,

1149
00:56:07,015 --> 00:56:08,974
like that little
girl or something.

1150
00:56:09,017 --> 00:56:10,192
- Was it?

1151
00:56:10,236 --> 00:56:12,369
- No. The hand reached
up and grabbed onto me

1152
00:56:12,412 --> 00:56:14,153
and dragged me in
holding my mouth.

1153
00:56:15,284 --> 00:56:18,505
- [Kim] Oh my god,
what did you do?

1154
00:56:19,811 --> 00:56:21,334
- I got free and ran.

1155
00:56:23,075 --> 00:56:25,599
Sucker's fast, it
would not stop.

1156
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,080
- What is it?

1157
00:56:28,123 --> 00:56:29,211
- Are you sure you wanna know?

1158
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:30,430
- Yes chase!

1159
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:31,997
- Then follow me.

1160
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,041
- Why?

1161
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:35,000
- Because I caught it.

1162
00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:38,960
I caught it and
trapped it in a cage.

1163
00:56:44,183 --> 00:56:45,532
You okay?

1164
00:56:52,234 --> 00:56:55,281
- [Kim] What is this place?
I don't see any lights.

1165
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,198
- I pounded on the door, I
don't think anyone lives here.

1166
00:56:59,241 --> 00:57:01,026
So I broke into the cage.

1167
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,245
[Chains rattling]

1168
00:57:06,553 --> 00:57:07,467
That's it.

1169
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:10,122
- [Kim] I'm not going near that.

1170
00:57:10,165 --> 00:57:12,429
- Don't worry, it can't
get lose, trust me.

1171
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,387
- What did you do?

1172
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,694
- Come on.

1173
00:57:16,737 --> 00:57:17,956
- [Kim] Chase,
chase, you know what?

1174
00:57:17,999 --> 00:57:19,566
Who cares what's in
there, just, let's go.

1175
00:57:20,915 --> 00:57:23,048
Seriously, this is so stupid.

1176
00:57:28,836 --> 00:57:30,447
[Rustling]

1177
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:32,231
What was that?

1178
00:57:32,274 --> 00:57:33,754
- [Chase] Just come on.

1179
00:57:35,103 --> 00:57:36,540
- [Amanda] Is it still in there?

1180
00:57:38,672 --> 00:57:40,108
- I hope so.

1181
00:57:41,414 --> 00:57:42,981
- [Kim] Wait a minute.

1182
00:57:55,863 --> 00:57:57,386
- Kim, come on, it's over here.

1183
00:57:58,431 --> 00:58:00,085
- [Kim] I can't see anything.

1184
00:58:18,843 --> 00:58:20,148
[Gasps]

1185
00:58:50,178 --> 00:58:52,877
[Screeching]

1186
00:58:54,487 --> 00:58:57,098
This is bad Amanda, really bad.

1187
00:58:57,142 --> 00:58:58,360
- Amanda.

1188
00:58:58,404 --> 00:58:59,361
- What were you thinking
bringing her here?

1189
00:58:59,405 --> 00:59:01,320
Are you trying to get us killed?

1190
00:59:01,363 --> 00:59:02,974
We have to go, Kim,
Kim, we have to go.

1191
00:59:03,017 --> 00:59:04,541
Forget chase, forget
the whole thing.

1192
00:59:04,584 --> 00:59:06,064
- Come on, Amanda, I'm sorry.

1193
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:10,024
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you wanted me to do.

1194
00:59:11,504 --> 00:59:14,115
Just relax for a second, I
couldn't just let it loose.

1195
00:59:14,725 --> 00:59:17,031
- I want you to call the police
and let them deal with this.

1196
00:59:17,075 --> 00:59:18,816
- First thing in the morning,
we'll call the police.

1197
00:59:18,859 --> 00:59:20,905
I get it, but there's
no land line here.

1198
00:59:20,948 --> 00:59:22,210
We have to go to my
parents for that,

1199
00:59:22,254 --> 00:59:23,951
and I'm a little bit
turned around right now.

1200
00:59:23,995 --> 00:59:25,736
- [Kim] Well, why don't
we find another house?

1201
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:28,129
- Yeah, look around, let me know

1202
00:59:28,173 --> 00:59:29,522
if you see any lights,
because I don't.

1203
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:32,394
- [Kim] So what, we're
just staying here?

1204
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:34,962
- Sun comes up in
a couple hours,

1205
00:59:35,006 --> 00:59:37,269
we can just hole up
here, no one's home.

1206
00:59:37,965 --> 00:59:39,750
- [Kim] Beautiful.

1207
00:59:39,793 --> 00:59:41,665
- How badly is she hurt?

1208
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:43,014
- Pretty bad.

1209
00:59:44,102 --> 00:59:45,582
- [Kim] What is that?

1210
00:59:50,282 --> 00:59:51,544
- I hit her with it.

1211
00:59:52,284 --> 00:59:53,459
- God.

1212
00:59:57,028 --> 00:59:59,726
Guys, I think we
have to help her.

1213
01:00:00,988 --> 01:00:02,555
- [Kim] God, Amanda.

1214
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,426
- I understand you're concerned,

1215
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,167
but this thing tried to kill us.

1216
01:00:06,211 --> 01:00:08,082
- Don't you think if
she wanted us dead,

1217
01:00:08,126 --> 01:00:09,562
we'd be dead by now?

1218
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,043
- I think she did try, but
something got in her way.

1219
01:00:13,131 --> 01:00:15,089
- I can't let her die,
I have to help her.

1220
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,746
- Okay. Fine.

1221
01:00:22,096 --> 01:00:24,011
But promise me that if
that thing gets dangerous,

1222
01:00:24,055 --> 01:00:25,317
you're gonna back off.

1223
01:00:26,448 --> 01:00:28,015
I don't want you getting hurt.

1224
01:00:29,756 --> 01:00:31,062
- I'll be fine.

1225
01:00:33,804 --> 01:00:35,457
- [Kim] Wait, what
am I supposed to do?

1226
01:00:35,501 --> 01:00:37,851
- Keep rolling, you're
gonna wanna remember this.

1227
01:00:37,895 --> 01:00:39,592
[Chains rattling]

1228
01:00:41,072 --> 01:00:42,551
- [Kim] Oh my god.

1229
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:45,250
Chase.

1230
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,341
- Here, give me this.

1231
01:00:49,384 --> 01:00:51,082
You guys stay here.

1232
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:34,125
[Gasps]

1233
01:01:44,265 --> 01:01:45,484
Shit.

1234
01:01:59,628 --> 01:02:00,934
Uh-oh.

1235
01:02:39,146 --> 01:02:41,018
[Door creaking]

1236
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:26,063
Oh, shit.

1237
01:03:28,674 --> 01:03:30,023
You again.

1238
01:04:37,786 --> 01:04:38,700
- Detective?

1239
01:04:38,744 --> 01:04:39,788
- Yeah, come on in.

1240
01:04:39,832 --> 01:04:40,746
- I've got Angus
out in the field,

1241
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:42,095
I think you need to hear this.

1242
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:46,012
Angus, Angus, come
in. What's your 20?

1243
01:04:47,448 --> 01:04:48,710
Come in Angus.

1244
01:04:48,754 --> 01:04:51,888
- [Angus] Okay, I’m
walking through it now.

1245
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:57,023
It's dark out here, this
place is kinda creepy.

1246
01:04:59,025 --> 01:05:00,984
Found some blood in the dirt.

1247
01:05:01,027 --> 01:05:04,074
I don't see any animal
tracks, just some footprints.

1248
01:05:05,553 --> 01:05:07,686
Leads up to an old house.

1249
01:05:07,729 --> 01:05:09,688
I'm gonna follow it
and see where it goes.

1250
01:05:12,865 --> 01:05:14,954
There's more blood.

1251
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:17,174
Yeah, there's definitely
blood out here.

1252
01:05:19,828 --> 01:05:21,047
- Do you see any bodies?

1253
01:05:21,091 --> 01:05:22,614
What else do you see Angus?

1254
01:05:23,571 --> 01:05:25,051
- [Angus] It's pretty dark sir.

1255
01:05:25,095 --> 01:05:26,705
I'm going through some trees.

1256
01:05:27,706 --> 01:05:29,186
Yes sir, I see them.

1257
01:05:29,229 --> 01:05:30,535
I see them, they're out here.

1258
01:05:31,797 --> 01:05:33,233
I'm running towards them.

1259
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:36,933
Jesus, it's those kids,

1260
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:40,545
it's those students.

1261
01:05:40,588 --> 01:05:42,068
Two of them.

1262
01:05:44,201 --> 01:05:45,985
Looks like a butcher
came through here.

1263
01:05:48,509 --> 01:05:51,948
They're dead sir,
they're both dead.

1264
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:56,169
- Angus, do you have a
good ID on the students?

1265
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,998
- [Angus] 100%
sir, I'm positive.

1266
01:06:00,086 --> 01:06:02,045
They've been dragged a bit.

1267
01:06:02,088 --> 01:06:04,047
All torn up here.

1268
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:05,352
- Do you see a little
girl out there?

1269
01:06:08,138 --> 01:06:10,879
- [Angus] No. Have
someone send the coroner.

1270
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,057
- Angus, listen to
me, you sit tight.

1271
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,059
We're gonna get some
additional units out to you.

1272
01:06:16,102 --> 01:06:17,538
Alright? Just sit tight.

1273
01:06:17,582 --> 01:06:18,757
- [Angus] Copy that.

1274
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,106
- Get some units out
from Warwick county,

1275
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:22,021
this may not even
be our jurisdiction.

1276
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:23,544
He shouldn't be out there alone.

1277
01:06:23,588 --> 01:06:25,198
- It's a long story captain,
but I'll get on it though.

1278
01:06:25,242 --> 01:06:26,504
- And send the coroner.

1279
01:06:26,547 --> 01:06:27,548
- Yeah.

1280
01:06:28,723 --> 01:06:29,986
- Shit.

1281
01:06:31,944 --> 01:06:33,250
- What is it about
this preserve?

1282
01:06:35,382 --> 01:06:37,036
- I heard about a
little girl disappearing

1283
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,429
out there 20 years ago.

1284
01:06:40,431 --> 01:06:44,043
But I was just a kid, I
never found a record of it.

1285
01:06:45,044 --> 01:06:46,524
Gotta say, I'm a
little nervous about

1286
01:06:46,567 --> 01:06:48,004
Angus being out there alone.

1287
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:50,136
- Well, he'd be smart
to keep his gun close.

1288

[Static]

1289
01:06:56,577 --> 01:06:57,970
- [Amanda] How do we know
it isn't waiting outside?

1290
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,624
- We don't.

1291
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:00,886
- [Kim] So, what?
We're just supposed to

1292
01:07:00,929 --> 01:07:03,019
stay in here like bait?

1293
01:07:03,062 --> 01:07:04,150
- You wanna go out there?

1294
01:07:04,194 --> 01:07:06,152
She'll tear you to
pieces. Trust me.

1295
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:16,467
You're worried aren't you?

1296
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:18,121
Hiding behind that thing.

1297
01:07:19,252 --> 01:07:20,949
- [Amanda] Maybe she left?

1298
01:07:20,993 --> 01:07:22,342
You know, maybe
she's gone by now?

1299
01:07:23,169 --> 01:07:24,083
- Maybe.

1300
01:07:25,476 --> 01:07:26,825
We're not going outside
until the sun comes up,

1301
01:07:26,868 --> 01:07:28,392
we've got about two hours.

1302
01:07:28,435 --> 01:07:30,742
- [Amanda] And you feel okay
staying in someone's house?

1303
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,527
- [Chase] Doesn't look like
anyone's been here in a while.

1304
01:07:33,571 --> 01:07:35,138
Power's not even on.

1305
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:37,662
It works.

1306
01:07:38,663 --> 01:07:40,795
- Is there any way we
can get a better view?

1307
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:43,102
You know, maybe see if
it's waiting for us?

1308
01:07:43,146 --> 01:07:44,799
- [Amanda] I saw a balcony.

1309
01:07:44,843 --> 01:07:46,584
Maybe we can see
something from up there.

1310
01:07:47,889 --> 01:07:49,021
- Okay.

1311
01:07:54,157 --> 01:07:55,245
Hold on.

help me click this on.

01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,999
- [Chase] Here, let me get it.

1318
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:06,011

1319

- [Chase] No.

1320
01:09:11,538 --> 01:09:13,366
- [Kim] Well maybe we
can make a run for it?

1321
01:09:14,237 --> 01:09:15,586
- [Chase] Where?

1322
01:09:15,629 --> 01:09:17,022
I still don't know where
the house is from here,

1323
01:09:17,065 --> 01:09:18,589
we have to wait til morning.

about to pass out.

1337

- God, I think she went
looking for clean water.

1338
01:10:19,302 --> 01:10:21,086
I'll go check.

1339
01:10:33,316 --> 01:10:36,144

help her, I tried.

it's just for now, okay?

1389

leave her for now,

This is all my fault.

- No it's not, you didn't
know this would happen.

I feel like I should've
never brought her here.

We should've never
left the house.

of hand, you know?
