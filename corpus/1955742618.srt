1
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,094
-You're back!
-Yeah, took the short route.

2
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,768
This is the most god-awful
boring post I've ever had.

3
00:01:41,803 --> 00:01:44,204
I'd kill you just
for something to do.

4
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,673
-What?
-Just kidding. Mostly.

5
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,278
What's up?
What do you mean?

6
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,781
You look like a kid with
your hand in the cookie jar.

7
00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:03,122
You didn't.
Bring her out.

8
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:08,960
Hi.

9
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,327
Gary, you idiot,
if the boss knew

10
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:12,532
you brought a girl out
here, she'd skin you alive.

11
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:14,134
You're not gonna
tell her, are you?

12
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:15,999
Give me one good reason.

13
00:02:16,034 --> 00:02:18,871
Easy. I brought
one for you too.

14
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,773
No, no no.

15
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,473
Hey, Gary.

16
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:25,344
Come on, Tyler.
There's nobody around.

17
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,511
We're guarding an empty lake.

18
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:30,282
Besides, me and Tracy
haven't seen each other

19
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,817
in almost a week.

20
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,172
Maybe we should go.
No!

21
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:40,058
We just want
to have some fun.

22
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,328
Alright, go ahead.

23
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:46,264
Aren't you coming?

24
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,801
Somebody's got
to mind the store.

25
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,873
Look, if this is gonna get
you into trouble, we'll leave.

26
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:58,041
Na, it's alright.

27
00:02:58,076 --> 00:03:02,097
Aren't you going
to go with them?

28
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:06,118
-Three's a crowd
-Yeah. Coffee?

29
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,629
You come over here.

30
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:20,265
It's time for you to take
some of your medicine.

31
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,736
You're not the boss
of me. I'm Tyson!

32
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,805
Tyler.

33
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:30,675
What'd I tell you,
bro? Best idea ever.

34
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,814
I gotta tell you Gare, when
you're right you're right.

35
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,917
And brother, you're right.

36
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:42,787
Gary.

37
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:46,058
Don't worry, this
place is deserted.

38
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,158
Nobody ever comes here.

39
00:03:48,193 --> 00:03:51,597
Besides, who's going to get
me in trouble, my supervisor?

40
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,540
-You know what?
-What?

41
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:07,112
-It's hot in here.
-You got that right.

42
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:10,717
No, I mean let's
get out of here.

43
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:11,915
You know I'm on the clock.

44
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,003
I can't just up and
leave the island.

45
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:18,057
Well then, let's
go under the stars then.

46
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,690
What do you think, Gare?

47
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:21,394
Can you handle
things without me?

48
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,362
Yeah. I got her covered.

49
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:37,776
Your romantic
evening awaits, my dear.

50
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,409
Such a gentleman!

51
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:42,247
Why can't you be a
gentleman like him?

52
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,983
Cuz you don't like gentlemen.

53
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:47,453
Yeah!

54
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:24,490
I guess, there?

55
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:33,231
Come on, lay down with me.

56
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,066
That water sure looks nice.

57
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:39,671
You look nice. Why
not come lie down with me?

58
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,442
No, I think I
wanna go for a swim.

59
00:05:42,507 --> 00:05:46,579
A swim? But I brought bubbly
and a blanket and everything.

60
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:54,319
I'm sorry, what?

61
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,258
Come on, come for a swim!

62
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:03,963
Gary...

63
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,608
Wait for me!

64
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,415
You know, this isn't
so bad after all.

65
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,792
See, a woman knows best.

66
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:38,096
And if you're the kind
of guy I think you are

67
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,500
you'll recognize I'm boss.

68
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:46,639
Ungh!

69
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:54,813
You see, this is what
I'm talking about!

70
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,819
Quit messing around!

71
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,625
My horoscope was right,
you're no good for me.

72
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:15,133
Did you hear that?
You're no good for me!

73
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:21,106
If you don't show yourself in
five seconds we're through!

74
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:26,112
One... two... three...

75
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,551
It's about time
you smartened up.

76
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:42,414
RAIDERS OF THE LOST SHARK

77
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:46,667
Subrip: Pix

78
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,564
I'm sorry that we're
boring you, Steven.

79
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,301
No not at all, Professor
Reynolds. I was just...

80
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:05,003
Having a dream? Well,
welcome back to reality.

81
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,240
-Sorry.
-Apology accepted.

82
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,974
Let's continue.

83
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,345
The megaladon was as species
of shark that originated

84
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,412
approximately
28 million years ago.

85
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:18,933
The sheer size of this
beast was staggering.

86
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:22,420
In some cases, up to and
over 60 feet in length.

87
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,022
-Professor Reynolds?
-Yes, Kim?

88
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:28,326
You said the shark originated
up to 28 million years ago?

89
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,826
That's right.

90
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:32,597
Well I was just wondering,
when did it become extinct?

91
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,366
There's speculation
that the creature died off

92
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,836
about 1.5 million years ago.

93
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:39,638
Speculation?

94
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,209
You don't think that this
could still exist, do you?

95
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,715
Professor Reynolds?

96
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,883
Sorry May. What
was your questions?

97
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,419
I was just wondering
about your thoughts

98
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,219
on the megaladon's extinction.

99
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:57,622
Do you think that
something like this

100
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,557
could still exist without
us knowing about it?

101
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,593
What about other
prehistoric sea life?

102
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,561
We know more about
the surface of the moon

103
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,631
than we do about the depths
of the oceans and the seas.

104
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,535
Reports of "submarine",
a 55 plus foot shark

105
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,604
feeding off the
coast of South Africa

106
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,206
are still being claimed today.

107
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,009
That's a big shark.

108
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:18,743
We've only just begun.

109
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,713
Tales of giant squid and octopus

110
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:22,613
have been reported for years

111
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,983
but only within the last
year have we actually

112
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,283
been able to record a
colossal squid in the wild.

113
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:30,822
We've only explored 5% of
what the oceans have to offer

114
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,824
and I don't think we
should close our minds

115
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,191
to the possibility
that maybe this,

116
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:37,529
or other prehistoric creatures,
could still exist today.

117
00:11:39,798 --> 00:11:41,966
So, just because my speech took
up the majority of the class

118
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,420
does not mean that
the work falls behind.

119
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:46,781
I expect you all to read
chapters 5 through 7

120
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:49,108
for the next class and
write down what creatures

121
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:51,676
you think may still
be alive today.

122
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,763
Take into consideration
climate and food chain.

123
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,849
I look forward to reading
your responses on Monday.

124
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,952
Thank you everyone and
have a great weekend.

125
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,182
Gary, I don't see anything.

126
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,686
Do you have to yell so loud?

127
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:39,907
Geez, I think I drank too much.

128
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:42,335
What are you
yelling at me for?

129
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,729
For the love of
all that is holy

130
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,431
my head is about to explode!

131
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:52,904
Listen, Tyler and
Sarah never came back.

132
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,374
I need to get him
back to his post

133
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:58,244
before the next shift arrives.

134
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,579
Why is the sun so bright?

135
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,450
We'll have a science
lesson another time.

136
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:07,253
You're an ass!

137
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:11,489
Hey look, over there!

138
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:15,394
Check this out.

139
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:18,863
It doesn't match
what I'm wearing.

140
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,864
No, it's what
Tyler was wearing.

141
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:25,904
-You know what I think?
-What's that?

142
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,239
They probably finished off

143
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,777
a nice, romantic night
in each other's arms.

144
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:37,614
Clearly, they're nude

145
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:42,187
and I don't feel like rudely
waking up naked people.

146
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:45,790
I suppose I can't
argue with that.

147
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,860
You know what I do feel like?

148
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,192
What?

149
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:53,064
I'm going to freshen
up in the lake.

150
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,141
Mama.

151
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,041
You should come in
here, the water's amazing!

152
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,277
Best cure for a hangover!

153
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:40,511
I'm good, thanks.

154
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:45,517
So much for my big,
brave security guard boyfriend.

155
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,084
I'm not scared of the water

156
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,053
I just don't feel like
swimming right now.

157
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,120
Who are you trying to kid?

158
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:55,627
Kid, nothing. I'm just
a dry-ground kinda guy

159
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,663
in the morning, that's all.

160
00:14:57,698 --> 00:15:00,049
Nice try, chicken!

161
00:15:00,084 --> 00:15:02,365
So I'm a chicken, now?

162
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,771
A big chicken! A big
old hungover chicken!

163
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,307
You know when you
get back on dry ground

164
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:09,774
you're gonna get it, right?

165
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,279
I'm not the one
who's a big fat...

166
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,516
Tracy!

167
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:29,227
Tracy!

168
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:38,670
Tracy, where are you?

169
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:44,842
Tracy! Where are you?

170
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:51,516
Where the hell...
where the hell am I?

171
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,052
I gotta get out of here.

172
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:05,296
So you guys want to go to
Spaz's party tonight or what?

173
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,463
I don't know, Steve.

174
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,132
Spaz's parties get
pretty out of control.

175
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,819
Yeah, that's why we should
all go. It'll be a riot.

176
00:16:10,854 --> 00:16:13,471
To be honest, I'm not a huge
fan of Spaz to begin with.

177
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:16,558
Why not?
Cuz he's a spaz, maybe?

178
00:16:16,593 --> 00:16:19,610
Ok, so what do you
guys want to do tonight?

179
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,378
Any bright ideas?

180
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,981
Isn't Wiener having a party?

181
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,748
Even worse.

182
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,918
What was up with
Professor Reynolds today?

183
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,484
She seemed really out of it.

184
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,988
Like, she drifted
off five times.

185
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,091
She probably just needs a
weekend of rest and relaxation.

186
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,091
Works for me
whenever I tune out.

187
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:37,195
Yeah, you must get
a lot of rest then.

188
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,796
Shut up!

189
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,583
No seriously, did some
stuff happen to her?

190
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:44,336
Like, bad stuff when
she was a kid, maybe?

191
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:46,170
I bet it was the island.

192
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,474
Yeah, I heard about it
when I was in high school.

193
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:49,742
She and some friends
went out to this island

194
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:51,644
and stuff got all messed up.

195
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,476
Yeah, I heard about that.

196
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:55,179
I just didn't know
Reynolds was involved.

197
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,115
Yeah, she was
the only survivor.

198
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,017
-Knock it off.
-Wait, what?

199
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,619
Come on, you have to
fill me in on this.

200
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:02,152
The only survivor?

201
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,706
Fill us, I want to
hear this story too.

202
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:07,191
Ok, so here's what
I heard happened:

203
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,561
Apparently there's this
company out on Murphy's Island

204
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:11,562
doing some research
or something.

205
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,999
Word is, something
happened there.

206
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,518
Something terrible.

207
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:16,966
Come on, really?

208
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:19,020
Well, not like a curse
or anything, but her sister

209
00:17:19,055 --> 00:17:21,039
got killed and so did a bunch
of people working there.

210
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:22,473
She was the only survivor

211
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,407
and she hasn't been
the same since.

212
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:26,811
That's insane, I wonder
what could have done it.

213
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,479
Judging by the
way she was today

214
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,214
it was probably some
big-ass shark or something.

215
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,782
Whatever.

216
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,184
That's what we should do!

217
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,552
What's that?

218
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,688
We should totally check
out Murphy's Island!

219
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,622
Didn't I just tell you?

220
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:42,091
I don't know, it kind
of sounds exciting.

221
00:17:42,126 --> 00:17:44,562
Kim, not you! I thought
you'd be cool about this.

222
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,999
You don't really believe
all that nonsense, do you?

223
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:49,018
No no, it's ok, maybe
we'll find Bigfoot

224
00:17:49,053 --> 00:17:50,967
and he can help us
row to the island.

225
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:53,137
Or we could just ride the
Loch Ness monster there!

226
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,540
So are you
coming, May or what?

227
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,175
Are you scared?

228
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,245
Come on, you really think
that's going to work on me?

229
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,530
I'm counting on it.

230
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:02,907
Well,
you are correct.

231
00:18:02,942 --> 00:18:04,214
You can count me in, guys.

232
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,351
Awesome! Looks like it's
gonna be an adventure weekend.

233
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:07,986
Just Steven and the ladies.

234
00:18:08,051 --> 00:18:09,053
No.

235
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,553
Anyone got a microbus?

236
00:18:10,588 --> 00:18:13,558
This is going
to be so awesome!

237
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:20,865
Rachel. You're right,
the guardhouse is empty.

238
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,901
If those bozos ducked
out early again...

239
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,303
They didn't.

240
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:25,671
How do you know?

241
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:30,641
Crap, they didn't.
They did.

242
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,444
-Dumbass!
-For sure.

243
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,780
Dragon Lady is going to
want to know about this.

244
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,515
You have to call it in.

245
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,852
Don't let her hear
you call her that.

246
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,159
Patch me through to the
boss, please. Code Red.

247
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:51,562
Ma'am, your worst fears
have been confirmed.

248
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,415
Both of them?

249
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,426
Yes, ma'am.

250
00:18:55,461 --> 00:18:57,065
Those idiots!

251
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,635
Yes, ma'am.

252
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,206
I told them to stay
away from the water!

253
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:04,073
It gets worse.

254
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:09,114
How can it
possibly get any worse?

255
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,817
It looks like they had dates.

256
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,387
Ma'am?

257
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,825
Ma'am, what would
you like us to do?

258
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,992
Collect all the evidence.

259
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,795
The geeks may find
something in that mess

260
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,898
and bring it all back here.

261
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:28,366
Understood.

262
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,470
Well, what did she say?

263
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,773
She wants you to
collect all the evidence

264
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:36,407
while I check the perimeter.

265
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,074
Really? How?

266
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:39,844
I don't know, grab
some garbage bags

267
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,446
from the guardhouse
or something.

268
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,347
Snap to it!

269
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:54,809
Laura!
What?

270
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:56,761
-What's that?
-Where?

271
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,429
There!

272
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,000
My god, there's
somebody alive out there!

273
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,802
We've got to get him
out of the water!

274
00:20:04,868 --> 00:20:07,872
Get out of the
water, it's not safe!

275
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,742
-Where did he go?
-He was just there!

276
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,744
You're going to have
to go in and check.

277
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,579
-What?
-Go in and check.

278
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:16,946
He's gone!

279
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:19,448
There he is! Go!

280
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:22,620
We're sending someone
out to save you!

281
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:25,289
Dammit

282
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,673
Don't worry, buddy. Hold on.

283
00:20:57,288 --> 00:21:01,727
Hey, where the hell did you go?

284
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,071
What the hell!?

285
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:18,309
Where's the rest of you?!

286
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:23,914
Fake! He was using a fake!

287
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,078
-Janet?
-Hello, Carly.

288
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,949
Or do we go by Professor
Reynolds these days?

289
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,085
Carly's fine. What are you...

290
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,104
I mean, why are you here?

291
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:04,348
It's about the island.

292
00:22:04,383 --> 00:22:06,522
The island. What about it?

293
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:09,027
I haven't spoken to or
said anything to anyone.

294
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:11,595
I know, I know. Relax, Carly.

295
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,434
And as long as it stays that
way, we'll be just fine.

296
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:17,967
I'm here for business.

297
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:20,404
We're in need of your expertise.

298
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,138
My expertise?

299
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:25,242
Yes. You know what.

300
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,089
Captain? Captain, wake up!

301
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:38,823
What? What the hell?

302
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,490
Captain, we just got a call

303
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,959
that might be of
interest to you.

304
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,394
You show me the
respect I am due.

305
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:45,361
You call me sheriff.

306
00:22:45,396 --> 00:22:48,332
But captain, first
of all, this is Canada

307
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,702
we don't have sheriffs
up here, and secondly...

308
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,936
Secondly, you call me sheriff

309
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:55,906
or you will no
longer be my deputy,

310
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,875
you'll go back to being
simply my brother-in-law.

311
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,080
Don't forget this post is a
favor to my wife, after all.

312
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:05,983
Sheriff,
sheriff, we just got a call

313
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:07,418
that might interest you.

314
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,418
That's more like
it. What kind of call?

315
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:13,022
Apparently, a pair of
townies have gone missing.

316
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:16,862
We just got a pair of frantic
phone calls from their parents

317
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:18,427
Townies?

318
00:23:18,462 --> 00:23:20,530
A couple of women
from down at the tavern.

319
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,999
Apparently, they were going
to hang out with these fellas

320
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:27,004
and have a party but
they never came home.

321
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:30,909
Great. I bet they just
can't hold their liquor.

322
00:23:30,944 --> 00:23:32,745
I'm sure we'll
find them sleeping

323
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,546
in a car at the
side of the road.

324
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:35,945
Apparently one of the ladies

325
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,884
is dating a guard that
works down at the island.

326
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,502
Well, if they
ended up there

327
00:23:40,537 --> 00:23:42,051
it's the Dragon Lady's problem.

328
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:44,288
She has her own security
force, let them deal with it.

329
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:47,191
But captain, sheriff...

330
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:50,025
I'll tell you what we do:

331
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,364
you go make a few phone
calls, see if the girls

332
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:54,430
ended up at any of
their friend's houses.

333
00:23:54,465 --> 00:23:57,034
I'm going to sit back,
put my feet up on my desk

334
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:00,005
and read the National Geographic
just for the pictures.

335
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,705
Do you catch my drift?

336
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,509
I hear you loud
and clear, sheriff.

337
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,511
Attaboy.

338
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,669
So is this where
seaweed is born?

339
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:33,838
You guys got
everything you need?

340
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:35,405
I think we're good.

341
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,309
So this guy, we're just
supposed to meet him here?

342
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:40,543
Who's this, and the what now?

343
00:24:40,578 --> 00:24:43,147
I kinda charted a boat
to take us to the island.

344
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,582
How in the hell?

345
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,148
I just let my
fingers do the walking

346
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:48,584
and called the guy
who charters his boat.

347
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:50,321
He sounds like a crusty
old seaman on the phone

348
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:52,323
but he's got a boat
and he promised

349
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,991
to take us to the island.

350
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:55,224
This is crazy.

351
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:56,927
They're going to hear us
coming from miles away.

352
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,093
Don't sweat it.

353
00:24:58,128 --> 00:25:00,447
With our luck, it'll
probably be a row boat.

354
00:25:00,482 --> 00:25:02,766
That is not cool, man.
I am not rowing a boat.

355
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,603
I'm not
doing any rowing either.

356
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:06,002
Come on, guys. Let's move.

357
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,538
I said we'd meet him
down by the docks.

358
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:08,906
Alright.

359
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,878
So, let me
understand this correctly.

360
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,481
You're telling me there's a
killer shark on the loose.

361
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,218
Well, we're not sure
yet, but if there is

362
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:22,920
we'll need someone
with your skill set.

363
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:27,625
So we figured, rather than
start again with someone new

364
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,192
You want someone who's seen

365
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,561
or killed one of these
before, am I right?

366
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,562
Well, in maybe
less colorful words, yes.

367
00:25:33,597 --> 00:25:36,835
But there's a lot more to this
than just finding a shark.

368
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,802
What else could there be?

369
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:43,173
So far you haven't exactly
sold me on this idea.

370
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,573
What if I were to
tell you that there

371
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:48,645
is a somewhat prehistoric
element to all of this?

372
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,683
I'd tell you you're
watching too many bad movies.

373
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:55,952
I'm dead serious
about this, Carly!

374
00:25:55,987 --> 00:26:00,926
A week ago, we discovered an
underwater cave while drilling.

375
00:26:02,326 --> 00:26:04,093
A cave?

376
00:26:04,128 --> 00:26:08,130
Yes, a cave,
which we now believe

377
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:12,037
had remained untouched
for thousands of years.

378
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:14,204
Go on.

379
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,674
Anyway, something got out.

380
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,278
I don't like
where this is going.

381
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:22,279
We sent a couple of divers in

382
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:25,584
to examine the cave
after the drilling

383
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:27,852
and they never came out.

384
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:30,119
Go on.

385
00:26:30,154 --> 00:26:33,591
More recently, some
of our security guards

386
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:38,597
went missing after swimming
in the lake, presumed dead.

387
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,765
Goddammit!

388
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,400
How do I put this?

389
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:49,441
I think we released
a killer shark.

390
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:52,641
Dammit, Janet, you
continue to drill

391
00:26:52,676 --> 00:26:56,080
in that lake even after
what happened to my sister?

392
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,379
We figured it was a long shot

393
00:26:57,414 --> 00:26:59,317
that something like
this would happen again.

394
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:01,752
Well, you rolled
the dice and lost.

395
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:05,255
Will you help me?

396
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,791
What do you want me to do?

397
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:11,363
Identify the problem
for sure, to start with.

398
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:14,030
If it isn't a shark,
we need to know.

399
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,533
And if it is, you need
to tell us what to do

400
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:17,801
to get rid of it.

401
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,704
I don't know about this.

402
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,711
I know this must be difficult,
but we really need you.

403
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:29,831
I know, it's just that...

404
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:32,917
I'm sorry about your sister.

405
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:36,453
I know this is hard.

406
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:58,375
Are you Captain Stubing?

407
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,378
It's Steuben. Captain Steuben.

408
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:05,016
What can I do for
you, young lady?

409
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:07,619
I'm May. I'm your
charter for today.

410
00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:09,852
We spoke on the phone earlier?

411
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:12,473
So you're the one
that wants to go

412
00:28:12,508 --> 00:28:15,051
to the forbidden island, are ya?

413
00:28:15,086 --> 00:28:17,875
I guess so. Why
is it forbidden?

414
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,189
It's all because
of the shark, miss.

415
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:24,434
These sharks aren't
like normal sharks.

416
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:29,474
These sharks are filled
with hate and piss and fire.

417
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:34,579
Look Captain, I don't
believe these bogus stories

418
00:28:34,614 --> 00:28:37,032
about dino-sharks or whatever
they're supposed to be.

419
00:28:37,067 --> 00:28:39,416
I've studied sharks and
they can't possibly hate.

420
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,120
They're creatures of habit
and instinct and that's it.

421
00:28:42,155 --> 00:28:45,122
Let me tell ya
something about sharks

422
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:48,625
you can't read about in
any books, young lady.

423
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,494
These sharks, they can hunt.

424
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:57,535
They can reason
and they can kill

425
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,941
with a vengeance
in their hearts.

426
00:29:07,077 --> 00:29:12,083
It was a shark
that took my hand.

427
00:29:14,618 --> 00:29:18,856
But you still have
both of your hands.

428
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:25,864
This
isn't my hand!

429
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:34,972
Can we get going now, or...?

430
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,181
So what exactly do
you expect me to do?

431
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:45,247
All in due time.

432
00:29:45,282 --> 00:29:46,850
It was great
catching up with you.

433
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,820
I'm glad you're doing so well.

434
00:29:48,855 --> 00:29:51,121
Yeah, I guess.

435
00:29:52,523 --> 00:29:56,226
Let's get the formalities
out of the way first, shall we?

436
00:29:57,261 --> 00:29:58,861
Sure.

437
00:29:58,896 --> 00:30:01,131
These are pretty
straightforward.

438
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,801
You're simply
signing that you will

439
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:06,821
in no way discuss
what goes on here.

440
00:30:06,856 --> 00:30:09,772
What exactly am I
getting myself into?

441
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:14,345
You simply sign and we
pay you to keep quiet.

442
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,153
Good. Let's get
started, shall we?

443
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:06,688
# Baby you're tryin to
hurt me when I'm down

444
00:32:06,723 --> 00:32:10,477
# And baby you know my
heart's been kicked around

445
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:14,231
# Well too much of you is
what's been getting to me

446
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:18,135
# And I don't want
to hear you're sorry

447
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,021
# Well I can't stand it

448
00:32:20,056 --> 00:32:21,872
# Frustration makes me blue

449
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:25,609
# But I'm so glad I'm
getting rid of you

450
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:29,311
# I've taken all I
can take from you

451
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:32,948
# Baby you lied and
you took me for a ride

452
00:32:32,983 --> 00:32:36,853
# Well I can't tell ya
how much that hurt inside

453
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:40,557
# Well if I can't take it
there's one thing I can do

454
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:44,295
# And I will start
by getting rid of you

455
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,964
# I've taken all I
can take from you

456
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:50,000
# Chains been bringing
me all the way down

457
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:51,967
# You know there
ain't nothin I can do

458
00:32:52,002 --> 00:32:54,304
# But if there's one thing
that makes me feel better

459
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,341
# It's to know that
I am rid of you

460
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:59,476
# I'm getting rid of you

461
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,013
# It's all that I can do #

462
00:35:13,543 --> 00:35:15,212
Sheriff! More news!

463
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,613
What, is
this about the townies?

464
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,633
No, sir. This is
about some tourists.

465
00:35:19,668 --> 00:35:22,161
Well I certainly
hope it was worth

466
00:35:22,196 --> 00:35:24,655
interrupting my
mid-afternoon nap.

467
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,423
A couple visiting from Quebec.

468
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,044
The husband claims that
the wife was killed.

469
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,595
Please tell me he
confessed so that we can

470
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,467
just slap the cuffs on him and
be home in time for Jeopardy.

471
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:39,737
He says she was
killed by a shark.

472
00:35:39,772 --> 00:35:42,137
-A shark?!
-A shark.

473
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:45,108
Where was the couple
when this shark attacked?

474
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,444
McDonald's Landing.

475
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:48,977
Near the island.

476
00:35:49,012 --> 00:35:50,815
Why do you always
call it an island?

477
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,634
Technically, it's a peninsula.

478
00:35:52,669 --> 00:35:54,383
Either way, I have a feeling

479
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,787
we've got a lot of
bad coming our way.

480
00:35:56,822 --> 00:36:00,323
I'll put some coffee on.

481
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,293
You do that,
deputy. You do that.

482
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,215
So what we need to do
is get you to the island

483
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,485
and see if we can
identify the problem.

484
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,087
Loud noises work well.

485
00:36:29,122 --> 00:36:30,620
I beg your pardon?

486
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,555
Loud noises, like explosives.

487
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,358
It could bring whatever's in
the water up to the surface.

488
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,694
Perfect!

489
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,531
But hold on a second,
I'm not a shark hunter.

490
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:43,367
I'm a fish expert who
knows a little bit about...

491
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:46,035
Think of it as an adventure.

492
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,706
Besides, we're not even
sure that it's a shark.

493
00:36:48,741 --> 00:36:51,142
Come on, this way.

494
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,551
What is this place?

495
00:37:02,586 --> 00:37:06,690
This is Rodney. He
monitors, well everything.

496
00:37:09,092 --> 00:37:12,429
Is that the island?

497
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:16,399
Yeah that's...

498
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:20,304
Yes, it is. And that's why
we keep him in this room.

499
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,408
Can you pause that
screen right there?

500
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:26,575
What do we have here?

501
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:31,615
Where is that? Are
they going to the island?

502
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:33,917
No no, they aren't going,

503
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,488
that's not on the island,
that's on, that's on,

504
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:40,455
Where the hell is it?

505
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,642
That's on the
other side, madam.

506
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,795
I suppose they'd
be going there.

507
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,796
Thank you.

508
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,099
I hope they aren't
planning on doing

509
00:37:48,134 --> 00:37:50,151
what it looks like they're doing

510
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:53,679
with all this shark nonsense.

511
00:37:53,714 --> 00:37:57,173
My god, those
are my students.

512
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:01,711
Live bait.

513
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:20,130
So, I don't mean to sound
like an impatient child...

514
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:22,583
Then don't say it.

515
00:38:22,618 --> 00:38:24,966
But are we there yet?

516
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:27,137
Kimberly, can you just
enjoy the relaxing boat ride?

517
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:29,557
The sun is shining,
the birds are chirping

518
00:38:29,592 --> 00:38:31,942
and old geezers are
free to walk outside.

519
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:35,012
Present company
excluded, of course.

520
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:40,615
I like walking.

521
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,117
Yeah Kim, just chill.

522
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:44,254
-Yeah.
-Sorry.

523
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:47,824
I just get a little bit
uneasy when I'm in the middle

524
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:51,394
of a huge body of water and
I'm nowhere near the shore.

525
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:54,498
I sure hope the
captain's smarter than he looks.

526
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:57,001
You
and me both, sister.

527
00:38:58,802 --> 00:39:01,739
Anybody want a bag
of complimentary nuts?

528
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:06,210
Yar.

529
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:14,284
Come on
let's go, let's go!

530
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:16,818
What's the big deal?

531
00:39:16,853 --> 00:39:19,672
When you've seen one beach,
you've seen them all.

532
00:39:19,707 --> 00:39:22,492
Easy for you to say, I
had to work days all summer.

533
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:25,228
I didn't get to go to the beach.

534
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,365
What are you doing?

535
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,866
I'm going swimming.

536
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,869
What did you think I was
going to do at the beach?

537
00:39:31,904 --> 00:39:33,769
Maybe take a walk?

538
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:37,141
You're not going in there,
that water's freezing.

539
00:39:37,176 --> 00:39:39,510
I'm totally
going in the water.

540
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:41,176
Whatever.

541
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:43,280
Come one, it'll be
fun! It'll be fun.

542
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:47,750
I'm not getting in there.

543
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,886
Come on, don't be a wimp.

544
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,854
Me, a wimp?

545
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:56,192
What's the problem, tough guy?

546
00:39:56,193 --> 00:40:01,132
The problem is,
I'm like 1% body fat.

547
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,635
My body doesn't
agree with the cold.

548
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,570
I'll freeze!

549
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,806
Whatever, I'm going in.

550
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:12,008
What about the fish?

551
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:14,008
What about the fish?

552
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:15,413
You know those little
bastards that nip you

553
00:40:15,448 --> 00:40:17,680
at your toes in the water?

554
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,784
What's the point of
having all that muscle

555
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:22,552
if you're afraid
of fish and water?

556
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,486
I'm not afraid of fish.

557
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:26,321
I just said I didn't like them.

558
00:40:26,356 --> 00:40:29,259
Come on, what have
fish ever done to you?

559
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:36,083
Flying shark?

560
00:40:36,118 --> 00:40:39,103
Flying shark!

561
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,710
I have to get out there.
I have to save those kids!

562
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:49,278
We'll get you
there right away.

563
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,648
We have a small plane that's
fueling up as we speak.

564
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:53,548
We can leave immediately.

565
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:57,654
Boss? There's
something you should see.

566
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,122
What is it?

567
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:01,856
Terror grips the town tonight

568
00:41:01,891 --> 00:41:06,062
in what seems to be a
series of deadly attacks.

569
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:09,532
What the hell is this
about? We have to go.

570
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,101
Hold on.

571
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:14,438
A tourist from Quebec
reports that his wife

572
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:16,840
was killed today
at a local beach.

573
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:20,009
Killed by a shark.

574
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,843
Dammit!

575
00:41:21,878 --> 00:41:23,711
Initially written
off as a false report

576
00:41:23,746 --> 00:41:26,516
this story has taken flight
due to a second shark attack.

577
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:28,152
A woman reports
that her boyfriend

578
00:41:28,187 --> 00:41:30,151
was also killed by a shark.

579
00:41:30,186 --> 00:41:33,324
Two couples with a
very similar attack?

580
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,092
More on this story
at six o'clock.

581
00:41:37,894 --> 00:41:39,829
Local beaches? Really, Janet?

582
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:42,432
I thought you said the shark
was contained to the lake?

583
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:45,201
There are some access
points that join the lake

584
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,769
to some outside bodies of water

585
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:50,273
but those points are
heavily secured by fences.

586
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:51,807
Rodney?

587
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,610
Checking now.

588
00:41:57,313 --> 00:42:02,085
It appears that all access
points have been breached.

589
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:06,055
This is not good.

590
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,555
Yeah, I would say not.

591
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,191
This is a lakeside
community, Janet.

592
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:12,930
Now that shark has the
run of the whole town.

593
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:15,030
We really need
your help, Carly.

594
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:19,403
I'll do what I can, but you
have to get me up there first.

595
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:25,275
Five bottles
of beer on the boat

596
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,644
five bottles of
beer! Take one down

597
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,512
pass it around
Captain?

598
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,315
Four bottles of
beer on the boat!

599
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,234
-Captain!
-Four bottles of beer

600
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:35,119
on the boat, four
bottles of beer!

601
00:42:35,154 --> 00:42:36,937
-Captain.
-Take one down

602
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:38,721
pass it around
Captain!

603
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:43,494
Three bottles of
beer on the boat!

604
00:42:43,529 --> 00:42:46,931
Shut
up! Just stop singing!

605
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:53,637
It's my boat, it's my rules.

606
00:42:54,003 --> 00:42:56,972
Now where was I?

607
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:00,309
You made me lose my place.

608
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,646
I'm going to have to
start all over again.

609
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:04,949
One thousand bottles
of beer on the boat

610
00:43:04,984 --> 00:43:06,968
one thousand bottles of beer!

611
00:43:07,003 --> 00:43:08,952
Take one down, pass it around!

612
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,492
What the hell was that?

613
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,036
I think we hit something!

614
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:35,545
There's nothing here to hit.

615
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,413
Let me take a look-see.

616
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:38,747
Be careful.

617
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:42,486
Don't worry your pretty
little head, missy.

618
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,003
Kimberly!
Hold on!

619
00:43:59,038 --> 00:44:01,336
Kim, swim towards the boat!

620
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:02,940
No, don't! Swim
towards the shore!

621
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:05,041
There's something by the boat!

622
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:18,288
Hello? Professor
Reynolds, is that you?

623
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,158
Please help us!

624
00:44:24,193 --> 00:44:26,529
Kim is gonna make it!

625
00:44:28,431 --> 00:44:29,866
My god!

626
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:32,285
Professor! Professor,
you have to send help!

627
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,704
The shark just got
Kimberly! What do we do?

628
00:44:53,956 --> 00:44:56,826
Stay together, don't
move. Get closer!

629
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:01,863
What's she saying?

630
00:45:01,898 --> 00:45:04,601
Something about...
don't stay together.

631
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:06,336
My god, split up!

632
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:12,173
No, stay together!

633
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:14,811
No, stay together!
She said stay together!

634
00:45:17,547 --> 00:45:19,048
Dammit!

635
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,132
Steven! Steven!

636
00:45:35,197 --> 00:45:38,902
Swim! Get to shore
while its busy feeding.

637
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:54,718
Sit tight,
May. Help is coming.

638
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:03,894
Janet, we've run out of time.

639
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:05,626
We have to get there.

640
00:46:05,661 --> 00:46:08,397
I told you, my people are
already filling up the plane.

641
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,532
Well, isn't
there a faster way?

642
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:13,836
If you think you can run
there any faster, be my guest.

643
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,773
Dammit, this is
history repeating itself.

644
00:46:16,808 --> 00:46:19,675
Just like what
happened to my sister.

645
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,112
This is the life.

646
00:46:22,147 --> 00:46:24,447
I know?

647
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:30,186
The water looks great?

648
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,896
Yep, the perfect day.

649
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,637
Such an amazing day for sure.

650
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,573
What the-? You freak!

651
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,611
I'm sorry,
I couldn't resist.

652
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:56,410
You were so out of it.

653
00:46:56,445 --> 00:46:57,930
Well, I'm not out of it now.

654
00:46:57,965 --> 00:46:59,416
What the heck is this stuff?

655
00:46:59,451 --> 00:47:00,849
Sunblock.

656
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:03,253
Now you won't burn that forehead
of yours like you always do

657
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,854
You're nuts, you know that?

658
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,555
Quit complaining
and go wash it off.

659
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:10,760
Three years of
university paying off right now.

660
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:13,294
-Shut up.
-Whatever.

661
00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:15,065
You know you could have
gotten some in my eye.

662
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,466
You know
you coulda got some in my eye.

663
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,470
Dammit Carly, I told you
I'd get something in my eye.

664
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:21,903
Stop being such a big baby.

665
00:47:21,938 --> 00:47:24,440
Just dunk your head in the
water, it'll rinse right out.

666
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:25,775
Pass me my towel, would you?

667
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,975
I still can't see.

668
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:31,514
Fine, I'll get
it you big baby.

669
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:35,618
Alright, let's stop
horsing around.

670
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:36,751
We have some work to do.

671
00:47:36,786 --> 00:47:38,519
Like I'm the one
horsing around.

672
00:47:38,554 --> 00:47:42,893
Look I know, but let's
collect the sample we need.

673
00:47:42,928 --> 00:47:45,059
Once we figure out if
there was any drilling

674
00:47:45,094 --> 00:47:47,797
that was done here then
we can call it a job done.

675
00:47:47,832 --> 00:47:50,266
Fine. Pass me a test tube.

676
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,652
Ta da!

677
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:11,955
Rita!

678
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,124
What?

679
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,562
Carly? Carly!

680
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:22,897
Let's get to the landing strip.

681
00:48:22,932 --> 00:48:25,402
The plane will be
there when we arrive.

682
00:48:25,437 --> 00:48:27,570
Let's go.

683
00:48:35,711 --> 00:48:37,114
Sheriff, sheriff!

684
00:48:37,149 --> 00:48:39,080
A shark.

685
00:48:39,115 --> 00:48:40,849
You guessed it.

686
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:42,719
This story's pretty
weird though.

687
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,519
Weirder than shark
attacks on a lake?

688
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:47,840
A man and a woman
were walking on the waterfront

689
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:51,127
and the woman says the
man was eaten by a shark.

690
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:52,794
So what's so weird about that?

691
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:55,565
She was in the
water. He was on land!

692
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,131
Come again?

693
00:48:57,166 --> 00:48:59,800
She said he was eaten
by a flying shark!

694
00:48:59,835 --> 00:49:02,471
Flying shark? Well now
I've heard everything.

695
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:04,690
What should we do, sheriff?

696
00:49:04,725 --> 00:49:06,909
Should we go close the beaches?

697
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,242
Round up a posse?

698
00:49:08,277 --> 00:49:10,077
One thing at a time, deputy.

699
00:49:10,112 --> 00:49:13,884
First things first,
help me find my pants.

700
00:49:13,919 --> 00:49:15,617
Yes, sir.

701
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,785
Then we'll go
down to that island

702
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:20,923
and find out what
the hell's going on!

703
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,759
Penninsula.

704
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:42,012
Kim, Steven. The phone!

705
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:50,053
I have wifi here!

706
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:52,687
I have wifi here?

707
00:49:52,722 --> 00:49:56,092
This is a really good phone.

708
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:01,463
Come on. Crap.

709
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,865
Come on May, you can do this.

710
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,670
Keep it together.
Just keep it together.

711
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,905
My gosh!

712
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,544
Hello? Hello?

713
00:51:22,945 --> 00:51:25,114
The what?

714
00:51:25,149 --> 00:51:27,283
Hello there.

715
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,419
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to frighten you.

716
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:30,952
Who are you?

717
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:34,423
I'm Howell and
this is my island.

718
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:36,192
Your island?

719
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:38,044
But there's a shark here.

720
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,895
It killed my friends.

721
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:42,332
I know, that would be mine.

722
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:44,099
Yours?

723
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,535
Yeah, but don't worry.

724
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,239
It's genetically engineered
and slightly radioactive.

725
00:51:49,274 --> 00:51:51,942
It's likely going
to be dead soon.

726
00:51:51,977 --> 00:51:53,777
What are you even doing here?

727
00:51:53,812 --> 00:51:55,242
Experiments.

728
00:51:55,277 --> 00:51:57,046
You're experimenting
on sharks?

729
00:51:57,047 --> 00:52:00,617
They are beautiful creatures
but I made them better.

730
00:52:00,652 --> 00:52:02,517
No, they kill people.

731
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:06,056
No no, they are nature's
most perfect machine.

732
00:52:06,091 --> 00:52:07,925
Perfect machine?

733
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,724
You bet they are.

734
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:13,730
They can smell one part per
million of blood in sea water.

735
00:52:13,765 --> 00:52:17,067
They can hear their prey
from many kilometers away.

736
00:52:17,102 --> 00:52:19,568
They can even detect the
electromagnetic field

737
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,771
that all living
creatures create.

738
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,671
Electromagnetic?

739
00:52:23,706 --> 00:52:25,606
That's right.,
the shark has got

740
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:29,011
the greatest electrical
sensitivity of any animal.

741
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:30,711
They can find their
hidden prey by simply

742
00:52:30,746 --> 00:52:33,482
detecting the electric
field that they produce.

743
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,153
I gotta get off this island.

744
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:40,356
It ain't gonna happen.

745
00:52:41,824 --> 00:52:43,492
Is that blood on your hands?

746
00:52:45,094 --> 00:52:46,495
I need your help.

747
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,662
What do you mean?

748
00:52:48,697 --> 00:52:50,933
My masterpiece is ready.

749
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:53,367
No, you're crazy.

750
00:52:53,402 --> 00:52:58,340
That's what Janet
said, I'm crazy.

751
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:03,280
And in a sane world it's
the crazy man who's king.

752
00:53:04,847 --> 00:53:09,853
Behold, the next step in
the evolution of the shark!

753
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:28,803
This is horrible.

754
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:30,671
We need to call
the National Guard.

755
00:53:30,706 --> 00:53:34,643
But this is Canada, we
don't have a National Guard.

756
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:37,144
What are we gonna do?

757
00:53:37,179 --> 00:53:38,914
How many
victims do you need

758
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,682
to qualify as a crisis?

759
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,420
I don't know, three or four?

760
00:53:43,455 --> 00:53:47,023
I think we're good.

761
00:53:48,657 --> 00:53:51,393
I have to admit Janet,
that was a pretty nice plane.

762
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:54,396
I know, it cost me enough.

763
00:53:55,731 --> 00:53:57,233
Did you hear that?

764
00:53:57,268 --> 00:53:58,332
Yes.

765
00:53:58,367 --> 00:54:00,603
Is that a flying shark?

766
00:54:05,307 --> 00:54:06,692
My god!

767
00:54:06,727 --> 00:54:08,042
My plane!

768
00:54:08,077 --> 00:54:09,278
Professor Reynolds!

769
00:54:09,313 --> 00:54:11,245
May! May.

770
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,815
I'm so glad to see you.

771
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:14,350
-Are you ok?
-Yeah.

772
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:16,084
Kim? Steven?

773
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:19,289
The shark, we fell
in the water and...

774
00:54:22,157 --> 00:54:24,576
It's ok, I'll get
you off this island

775
00:54:24,611 --> 00:54:26,996
and I'll make those
responsible pay.

776
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:28,498
We need to move.

777
00:54:28,533 --> 00:54:29,897
Who's this?

778
00:54:29,932 --> 00:54:33,836
May, meet Janet, the one
responsible for all of this.

779
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:34,936
You bitch.

780
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:37,340
No May, it's not the time.

781
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:39,908
But Kim and Steven...

782
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,209
I hate to break this up...

783
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:43,313
Then don't. She
needs a moment.

784
00:54:43,348 --> 00:54:44,948
We may not have one.

785
00:54:49,952 --> 00:54:52,688
Shit, we need
to get out of here.

786
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:54,290
Janet, which way?

787
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,689
I don't know!

788
00:54:55,724 --> 00:54:58,460
I own the island but I've
never been here before.

789
00:54:58,527 --> 00:55:00,829
There was a creepy
guy back the way I came.

790
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:02,565
Then let's head that way.

791
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,064
But he did this.

792
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:06,168
Yeah, so he may know how
to get us off the island.

793
00:55:06,203 --> 00:55:07,436
Let's go.

794
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:24,854
-May!
-Over here.

795
00:55:26,121 --> 00:55:28,540
What happened? Where did it go?

796
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,960
I don't know.
Come on, let's go.

797
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:33,827
Janet? Janet!

798
00:55:33,862 --> 00:55:36,365
I think she fell
down that hill.

799
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,633
Dammit Janet.

800
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,334
What do we do now?

801
00:55:40,369 --> 00:55:41,535
We have to find that guy.

802
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:42,706
He'll know how to get
us off the island.

803
00:55:42,741 --> 00:55:44,240
Ok, well he was back this way.

804
00:55:44,275 --> 00:55:45,942
Okay.

805
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:55,552
Carly? May?

806
00:55:57,786 --> 00:56:00,155
Hell, Janet.

807
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,490
Brad.

808
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,576
What are you doing here?

809
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,593
I own this island, remember?

810
00:56:06,628 --> 00:56:09,833
No you don't,
you sold it to me.

811
00:56:09,868 --> 00:56:12,233
Your check bounced.

812
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:14,771
Doesn't matter. I don't
work for you anymore.

813
00:56:14,806 --> 00:56:16,923
Wait a minute.

814
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:19,117
You did it, didn't you?

815
00:56:19,152 --> 00:56:21,242
You made the formula work.

816
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:23,278
Well that would
seem pretty clear.

817
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:25,312
Wait dammit!

818
00:56:25,347 --> 00:56:28,884
I want you to come
back and work for me.

819
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:32,255
After what you did? No way.

820
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:34,122
I can change that.

821
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:38,061
Anything you want, I
can make it happen.

822
00:56:38,096 --> 00:56:41,930
It doesn't matter.
I don't trust you.

823
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:46,236
I asked you for one
thing and one thing only

824
00:56:46,271 --> 00:56:48,769
and you laughed at me. Me!

825
00:56:48,804 --> 00:56:50,973
The most brilliant
scientist on your staff

826
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:54,177
and you humiliated me
in front of everyone.

827
00:56:54,212 --> 00:56:56,079
Well, no more.

828
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,616
-What?
-We have to kill it.

829
00:57:00,651 --> 00:57:02,351
It's happening all over again!

830
00:57:02,386 --> 00:57:04,287
Ok, we'll kill it.

831
00:57:04,322 --> 00:57:06,506
Where's my bag?

832
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:08,655
Watch the skies.

833
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:11,627
Why is there never a cop
around when you need one?

834
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:23,389
Shouldn't we be
doing something?

835
00:57:23,424 --> 00:57:27,342
We are. We're
securing the beach.

836
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,892
-The sky.
-Right.

837
00:57:48,764 --> 00:57:51,064
May, are you alright?

838
00:57:51,099 --> 00:57:54,001
Yeah. You get the
number of that truck?

839
00:57:54,036 --> 00:57:57,639
Well I see you didn't
damage your sense of humor.

840
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:00,676
Screw it, you're
my responsibility

841
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:03,010
and I'm going to get
you off this island.

842
00:58:03,045 --> 00:58:05,748
I won't let what happened
to my sister happen to you.

843
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:07,448
Can you walk?

844
00:58:07,483 --> 00:58:09,651
Help me up and I'll dance.

845
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:12,088
Yeah, forget what I said
about your sense of humor.

846
00:58:12,123 --> 00:58:14,254
I thought it was funny.

847
00:58:14,289 --> 00:58:17,226
Sorry ladies, but you're
not going anywhere.

848
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:23,949
There's my baby.

849
00:58:23,984 --> 00:58:26,134
You can't do that!

850
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:29,405
Yeah, I think I
can. Right, Janet?

851
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:32,606
I knew it!

852
00:58:32,641 --> 00:58:34,877
I knew this is what
you wanted all along.

853
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:37,380
I'm sorry you feel that way.

854
00:58:39,047 --> 00:58:41,383
Thank god, Janet.

855
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:43,818
Don't thank me yet.

856
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,722
You were right about one thing:

857
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:48,923
that fish needs to die

858
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,193
and you're just
the one to do it.

859
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:53,126
No, it's too dangerous.

860
00:58:53,161 --> 00:58:54,930
We have to get off this island.

861
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:57,166
There's no boat.

862
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:59,367
Yeah there is.

863
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:01,771
I have one on the other
side of the island.

864
00:59:01,806 --> 00:59:04,474
A really nice 30-foot
pleasure craft.

865
00:59:04,509 --> 00:59:09,479
Radio, GPS, even a jacuzzi.

866
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:13,182
All the bells and whistles.

867
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,751
What?

868
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:20,856
Alright, let's go before
the shark comes back

869
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,992
while we still have a chance.

870
00:59:23,027 --> 00:59:25,359
No. We're killing it.

871
00:59:25,394 --> 00:59:29,532
You're killing it, so grab
your gear and go hunting.

872
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:34,053
Ok, don't hurt anyone.

873
00:59:34,088 --> 00:59:36,497
You better not miss.

874
00:59:36,532 --> 00:59:38,872
No, you can't do this.

875
00:59:38,907 --> 00:59:40,909
It's a monster,
it has to be killed.

876
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:42,609
No!

877
00:59:42,644 --> 00:59:44,746
She's right, the
fish has to die.

878
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:47,783
No, not my baby!

879
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:51,387
Hey, give it back!

880
00:59:58,193 --> 01:00:00,528
Janet.

881
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:04,166
Brad. Why did I marry you?

882
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:07,170
Because I said yes.

883
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:13,207
May, how did you know?

884
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:14,677
Well, I saw him
fiddling with this

885
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:15,876
when we heard the shark come

886
01:00:15,911 --> 01:00:17,312
and then I remembered
what he said

887
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:20,182
about shark's having an
electromagnetic sensitivity.

888
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:21,784
So I just figured,
maybe he was using this

889
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:23,519
to hide his
electromagnetic field.

890
01:00:23,554 --> 01:00:25,854
May, that was brilliant!

891
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:29,224
I don't care what they say
about you, that was brilliant.

892
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:32,626
Thanks, I just... wait, what?

893
01:00:32,661 --> 01:00:33,962
Let's go before
the shark comes back.

894
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,065
What do they say about me?

895
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,503
Professor, we can use
this to hide from the shark

896
01:00:41,538 --> 01:00:43,639
while we look for Howell's boat.

897
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:47,676
We're not going, are we.

898
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:51,180
I hate to admit it
but Janet was right.

899
01:00:51,215 --> 01:00:53,146
We need to kill this thing.

900
01:00:53,181 --> 01:00:57,786
-But...
-No buts. Stay hidden.

901
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:02,624
Come on out, you flying fish!

902
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:06,262
You've had your dinner
now have your dessert.

903
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:19,509
Professor Reynolds?

904
01:01:20,742 --> 01:01:22,511
May, no!

905
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,798
-It's coming.
-May, what have you done?

906
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:29,117
It won't come unless
it smells blood.

907
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:44,867
Professor?

908
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,805
It's been a blast.

909
01:01:50,806 --> 01:01:53,709
Chief, I mean sheriff, look!

910
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:00,914
Well look at that.

911
01:02:00,949 --> 01:02:02,384
Do you think that's
the flying shark

912
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,087
everyone's been talking about?

913
01:02:05,887 --> 01:02:08,356
I reckon so.

914
01:02:23,739 --> 01:02:25,942
Cool!

915
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,064
You did it!

916
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:33,758
We did it.

917
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:35,417
Now what?

918
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:38,618
We find Howell's boat
and we go home.

919
01:02:38,653 --> 01:02:41,123
You know, you did really
good figuring out

920
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:42,991
that electromagnetic thing.

921
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:45,260
Thanks, you weren't so bad
with that action hero bit.

922
01:02:45,295 --> 01:02:49,398
Thanks. Did you finish
your homework for Monday?

923
01:02:53,953 --> 01:02:57,453
Subrip: Pix

924
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:53,079
# Baby tryin to hurt

925
01:05:53,114 --> 01:05:56,651
# And baby you know my
heart's been kicked around

# Well I can't stand it

01:06:06,164 --> 01:06:07,796
# Frustration makes me blue

# But I'm so glad

932

# Well I can't tell ya

935
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:26,614
# Well if I can't take it

936
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:30,552
# And I will start
by gettin rid of you

937
01:06:30,587 --> 01:06:34,421
