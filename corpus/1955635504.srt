1
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,119
Nothing.

2
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,290
Hit and run.

3
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,495
Whoever it was, they're gone.

4
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,497
War's over. He got the memo.

5
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,601
Ize?

6
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:47,473
Allen?

7
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:49,475
Ize.

8
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:52,244
What?

9
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,780
We got no movement,
not a sign of a shadow.

10
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,149
How...

11
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,184
How long we been here, man?
18-plus?

12
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,857
- Twenty.
- Jesus.

13
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,295
There's nobody
fucking out there, man.

14
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,234
- 'Less he's a pro.
- A hajji?

15
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:17,436
I'm just saying, maybe.

16
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,241
Six construction guys
on that pipeline.

17
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,477
Huh?

18
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,313
Two-man security escort.

19
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,382
Yeah.

20
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:33,285
Look at 'em.

21
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,820
What?

22
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:38,824
Eh, not one body near
to anything resembling cover.

23
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,160
That's just fucking weird to me.

24
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:41,160
Don't mean shit, man.

25
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:45,230
Means he took them out
pretty fucking fast.

26
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:58,710
And I think they're all
fucking head shots, too.

27
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,479
Oh, fuck off. Look, hey.

28
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:02,915
Check out our boy with
the radio; He got the call out?

29
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,186
Yeah.

30
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,854
That ain't a head shot, Ize.

31
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:12,224
Okay, fine, so one
without a fucking head shot.

32
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,294
I mean, eight guys, 30 seconds?

33
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:17,196
So you're saying a hajji
went in there with a semi-auto?

34
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,630
Said he might be a pro.

35
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:19,731
Oh, right.

36
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,334
We're dealing with Juba now?

37
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,236
Might be.

38
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,439
I'm just saying,
that wall's cursed.

39
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,674
It's a wall, man.

40
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:31,476
You're scared of a fucking wall?

41
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:34,279
Nah, I'm scared of
what's behind it.

42
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,381
Could be two hajjis
sucking each other off

43
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,383
behind that thing.

44
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,718
Hey.

45
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,588
What's there is there.

46
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,591
Rest of that shit's
in your head, you understand?

47
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,789
Ize?

48
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,324
Mm-hmm?

49
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,826
What's your vote now?

50
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,494
Got anyone out there?

51
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:25,330
Nah.

52
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,499
I mean, I was 60% sure.

53
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,305
Now I'm, like, 80.

54
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,807
I don't think so.

55
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,980
Or... yep, he's a pro.

56
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,015
Oh, fuck off.

57
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,650
Probably the same
as it always is.

58
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:47,886
Four or five hajjis came in
and bushwhacked 'em.

59
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,855
Mm-hmm.

60
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:52,924
Yeah, makes sense.

61
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,927
Maybe.

62
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,373
Or he's a pro.

63
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,841
I'm fucking hot.
I'm calling it.

64
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,376
Ah, see, fuck you, man.

65
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,512
I knew that's what
you wanted to do.

66
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:15,447
I'm fucking with you, man.

67
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,049
What, are you
fucking hungry again?

68
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,451
Already had four or five MREs,
gorilla fuck.

69
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,819
I'm not fucking sitting here

70
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,454
dancing around
your super-theories

71
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,823
that a fucking super-sniper's
down there, bro.

72
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,994
No fucking way a hajji
sticks around this long.

73
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,696
You shitting me?

74
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:32,064
I'm fucking hot as shit.

75
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,433
My balls have melted
into one fucking ball.

76
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,934
Later, you're on duty,

77
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,536
you're gonna pry these apart,
all right?

78
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,071
Oh, yeah,
if I can fucking find it.

79
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:42,374
And you're gonna
fucking like it, too.

80
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:43,909
I should've joined
the fucking air force.

81
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:45,944
Nah, you're too fucking big
for the air force.

82
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,746
You'd bring
the whole thing down.

83
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,084
Hey, I'm serious, man.

84
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:54,052
- Get down.
- I'm serious, too.

85
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:57,923
I'm going down there,
grabbing that guy's radio,

86
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:00,625
coming back up here, and we are
getting the fuck gone.

87
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,828
Yeah, Roger that.

88
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,534
Comm check.

89
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,404
Yup-yup. Check-check.

90
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,787
Where have you gone?

91
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,123
Oh, yep.

92
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,058
Movement?

93
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,594
Ah, you look
fucking rigid as shit.

94
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,700
How's that one ball?

95
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:44,136
Oh, real nice. Real smart.

96
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:46,571
You'll always be
number one to me, my man.

97
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,579
You got eyes on that wall?

98
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,482
I got eyes on your ass.

99
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,785
Oh, shake that Booty.

100
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,887
Oh, yeah, there it is.

101
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:02,954
Uh.

102
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,824
Ooh, there we go. There it is.

103
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,793
I think your tampon
just fell out.

104
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:10,595
Damn right. That'd
usually cost you 25 bucks.

105
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,448
You're clear 360.

106
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,452
Keep them eyes open.

107
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,830
Just watch my six.

108
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,832
Roger that.

109
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,477
Yeah, we're fucking
solo out here.

110
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,749
Lonely as fuck.

111
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,965
Fuck.

112
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,166
I'm getting closer here.

113
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,901
You got eyes on that wall?

114
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,903
Roger that.

115
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,708
- Shit.
- What?

116
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,711
Ah, this...

117
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,247
Man, this fucking thing's
fogging up, man.

118
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:41,086
You have got to get
rid of that shit.

119
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,792
It was Dean's.

120
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,962
Fuck Dean. Dean was a bitch.

121
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,797
Yeah, fuck Dean.

122
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,200
Dean was a bitch.

123
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,736
Bad Juju carrying around
a dead man's scope.

124
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,147
Something's not right.

125
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,250
What?

126
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:48,787
Talk to me, man, talk to me.
What's going on down there?

127
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:51,990
Ize, they are head shots, man.

128
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,598
Can you tell
where they came from?

129
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,010
You know what, fuck it.

130
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,713
Get the hell out of there, bro.

131
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:17,215
Hey, Ize, just check the...

132
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,287
Ah, shit, I'm hit!

133
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,389
Fuck, man, fuck! I fucked up.

134
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,157
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

135
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,728
Fuck! Shit!

136
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,004
Hang on, buddy.
I'm coming down.

137
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,639
Shit.

138
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,897
They see me out there.
They see me out there.

139
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,332
Back up! Back up!

140
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,933
- Take cover! -They see me
out there.

141
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,402
Take cover!
What are you doing, man?!

142
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,404
No! Get away from me, man!

143
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:13,972
No!

144
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:16,007
No! No!

145
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,678
Back up!

146
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,380
- Oh! Fucking shit!

147
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,053
Take cover!

148
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:33,058
Get down!

149
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,140
Ah! Shit! Fuck!

150
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,280
Sar'nt!

151
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,082
- Sar'nt Matthews!

152
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,955
Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

153
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,757
Ah, shit...

154
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,525
Fuck, I'm sorry!

155
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,330
Shit. Fuck.

156
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,434
No way. No fucking way.

157
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,002
Ah, shit. Okay, uh...

158
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,871
My brother, fucking tell RJ.

159
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:54,272
You got to tell him, okay?

160
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,108
- What about RJ?
- RJ.

161
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,778
Tell fucking RJ that I got...

162
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,114
I got fucking... I got fucking
22 grand, man. 22 grand.

163
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,183
Stop, stop.
Stop talking, bro.

164
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:08,052
I don't know what to do. I
don't know what to fucking do.

165
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,858
Tourniquet.

166
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,127
Use your fucking tourniquet.

167
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,331
Fucking... tourniquet!

168
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:24,002
Use your fucking tourniquet!

169
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,476
Ize.

170
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,245
Ize, I need
your fucking help, man.

171
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,446
I can't!

172
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,848
You know that!

173
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,383
No, no, no, no!

174
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:40,518
Fucking...
The radio, the radio!

175
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,059
Fuck.

176
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,929
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

177
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,465
You got it?

178
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,242
Fuck.

179
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,279
Fuck, man, you got it?!

180
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,281
One second!

181
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,571
Oh, god.

182
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,256
- Breaker, breaker...

183
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,058
Aw, shit.

184
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,664
Break, break, break,

188
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,010

00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,976
He hit my fucking antenna!

201
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,180
Hit the fucking antenna, man.

202
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,385
Fuck.

203
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,111
You got eyes on him?

204
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,046
I think I got a shot.

205
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,050
What?

206
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:01,252
I'm going for it, man.

207
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,321
- You got eyes?

208
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:06,190
Fucking... Sar'nt Matthews!

209
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,126

00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,531
Sar'nt!

212
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,133
No, no, no, no, no.

213
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,801
He'd shoot you
before you even get...

214
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,536

00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,138

00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,344
Hang in there.

219
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,146
Please fucking hang in there.

220
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:34,085
You got eyes on him?

221
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,457
Come on, man,
where'd he come from?

222
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,459
I don't fucking know.

223
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,327
I don't know.

224
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:47,265
Crack bang.
What's the distance?

225
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:50,735
Crack bang. Crack bang.

226
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,170
Didn't you hear it?

227
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:54,539
Crack bang, how many seconds?

228
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,242
Give... give me a fucking...

229
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:02,180
Ize. You didn't fucking Gauge?

230
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:04,582
Listen, man,
I got one shot at him.

231
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,518
Don't fucking
touch that rifle, man.

232
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,455
Second you touch that fucking
rifle, you're dead.

233
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:13,391
Hold on.

234
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,385
Aah!

235
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,354
Fuck!

236
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:45,656
Oh. Oh.

00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,969
All right.

243
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,971
Shane, I got eyes on him.

244
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,645
Sar'nt Matthews?

245
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:24,348
Sar'nt Matthews,

246
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,286
Shane!

247
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,988
Oh, man.

248
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,591
Come... you didn't bleed out.

249
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:36,627
Come on, man, get up.

250
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,330
Get up
and dress that wound, man.

251
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,937
Oh...

252
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,377
Mm. Oh.

253
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,319
Aah... aah...

254
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:05,656
Oh! Aah.

255
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,898
Fuck. Fuck.

256
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:42,360
Oh! Oh!

257
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,037
You motherfucker.

258
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,808
Fu... fucking...

259
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:01,145
Fuck. Fuck.

260
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:07,685
Okay.

261
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,794
Last transmission.

262
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,631
Come in.

263
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,633
How do you copy?

264
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,971
Come in.

265
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:02,973

00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:10,948
Come in.

267
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,784
How do you copy?

268
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,586
How do you read us?

269
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,561
- Last transmission.

270
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,832
How do you copy?

271
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,502
How do you copy?

272
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:34,505
This is spartan thirty tree.
How copy?

273
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:37,208
Reading you Lima Charlie, over.

274
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,045
This is spartan thirty tree.

275
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:43,147
Receiving enemy fire.

276
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,883
Requesting dust-off.
I got a man down.

277
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:48,552
There's a shooter.
Got us pinned.

278
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:50,888
Me, got me pinned.
Requesting medevac.

279
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:54,124
I repeat, I repeat,
requesting medevac.

280
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,195
What's your position, over?

281
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:02,132
Uh, uh, grid whiskey hotel 7203.

282
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:04,969
Copy that. Stand by.

283
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,812
Oh, god.

284
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:17,281
Hey, Shane.

285
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:19,283
We're going home, buddy.

286
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,267
About fucking time.

287
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,151
All right, come on.

288
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:55,753
This is spartan tree tree.

289
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:57,688
Are you there, over?

290
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,056
Okay.

291
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,858
Reading you Lima Charlie.

292
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,160
You're on a radio feed,
and we do not

293
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,596
want to move beyond range
of your signal. Do you copy?

294
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:06,931
Beyond range of my signal?

295
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,566
You're already
in my local radio.

296
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:11,769
Are you close?

297
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:13,938
Need a confirm on your ID, over.

298
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:19,910
This is Sar'nt Allen Isaac,
51st Oda.

299
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:23,847
I have staff Sar'nt
Shane Matthews here with me.

300
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:26,183
But he's down.

301
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:28,252
Possibly Kia.

302
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:31,622
I don't know.
He's not responding, so...

303
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:35,326
Over.

304
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:37,728
We copy, spartan tree tree.

305
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,730
Prepping medevac.

306
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:46,136
Oh, Jesus Christ.

307
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,076
All right,
you little fucker, you.

308
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,381
Ah...

309
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:59,883
Huh.

310
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:02,686
Fucking NATO round.

311
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:05,055
Goddamn.

312
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:08,759
7.62x51.

313
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:11,662
No, we got a shooter.
High-caliber weapon.

314
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:13,330
Requesting UAV.

315
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:16,767
We need your challenge code
before we send in medevac.

316
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,869
W-what? Say-say that again.

317
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,337
Send your challenge code.

318
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:23,007
What the fuck is...
No. But, um...

319
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,180
Who is this?

320
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:31,949
This is captain Otis Simmons.

321
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:33,717
I need your challenge code

322
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:36,654
if I'm gonna get you
and your staff Sar'nt medevac.

323
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,889
Uh, Romeo, no... no, wait,

324
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:41,058
I didn't say
I needed medical assistance.

325
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,793
Do you copy?

326
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:45,763
Copy that. I assumed.

327
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:48,098
But this is protocol.

328
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,837
Well, fuck me.
How do I know that?

329
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,107
Huh? That you are
who you say you are?

330
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:00,244
Allen Isaac. You and your
staff sergeant Shane Matthews

331
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:02,413
made an overnight worm
into a kill zone

332
00:28:02,415 --> 00:28:04,348
to investigate
a potential sniper

333
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,350
and report back to us.

334
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,419
Okay, okay.

335
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:11,155
All right, I'm sorry.
I'm-I'm a little fucked up.

336
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:13,457
It, uh... listen, you
got to bring a heavy escort.

337
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:15,759
This guy's a fucking asshole.

338
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:27,271
Where do you keep going?

339
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,176
Do you have a flare, sergeant?

340
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,082
Do you copy?

341
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:40,217
Uh, yeah. No, I don't.

342
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,386
I have an m4 and a sidearm.

343
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:45,122
I need you to stand
and fire into the air.

344
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:47,057
We need to get a lock
on your position.

345
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,427
What the fuck?
This ain't ranger school.

346
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:53,330
The fucking shooter will get
a fucking lock on my position.

347
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:55,966
Well, I can't help you
unless I know your location.

348
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,968
Do you copy?

349
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,372
Fuck.

350
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,007
A lot of fucking help
you've been

351
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:06,343
so fucking far, motherfucker.

352
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:19,223
This is fucking stupid.
This ain't fucking protocol.

353
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:21,191
Sergeant, we need
your exact location

354
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:22,459
to send in medevac.

355
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:24,361
Say that again.

356
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,430
I need your location.

357
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,899
No, my rank. What's my rank?

358
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:30,501
Sergeant.

359
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:34,905
You, uh...

360
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:37,007
You got an accent.

361
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:39,877
Not American.

362
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:44,314
You have seen through
my camouflage.

363
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:47,885
Fuck you talking about?

364
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:51,321
I'm talking about
hiding behind words.

365
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:56,527
Like you are hiding
behind that wall.

366
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:59,229
You... you're...

367
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,534
Motherf...

368
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:10,440
Oh, shit.

369
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:14,444
You fuck!

370
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,083
I've got a question for you.

371
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:22,319
Your friend... is he dead?

372
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,821
Ugh.

373
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:25,589
He... he looks dead to me.

374
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:28,091
This is spartan 33
sending in the blind.

375
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:29,593
But maybe he's just unconscious.

376
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:31,929
I got a man down!

377
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:33,330
Sh-shall I make sure?

378
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,932
I got a sniper.

379
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:37,067
I got an enemy sniper.

380
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,203
- Requesting medevac!
- Shall I shoot him in the head?

381
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:40,604
I repeat. I repeat.

382
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:42,206
- Requesting...
- Does he have a wife?

383
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:44,208
Children?

384
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,448
Will they enjoy a closed casket

385
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,051
if I take his face off?

386
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:57,154
All right, all right,
shut the fuck up, man.

387
00:30:57,156 --> 00:31:00,023
All right, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

388
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,934
Is there something
that you want?

389
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:12,269
Yes.

390
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:14,171
Well, I don't know nothing.

391
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:16,874
I'm a buck Sar'nt.
They don't tell me shit.

392
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:18,175
So fuck you.

393
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:19,576
That's not what I want.

394
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:22,145
Oh, what do you want?

395
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:24,982
You want fucking
12 virgins or something?

396
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,319
I want to get to know you.

397
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:32,122
I just want to get to know you.

398
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:34,124
Will you allow that?

399
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:39,229
Y... you're fucking with me.

400
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:45,369
I was, but you figured it out.

401
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:47,271
So now let's be real.

402
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:50,207
It's just you and me out here.

403
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:52,542
So, what do you say?

404
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,480
Yeah, I'll talk to you.

405
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:58,916
Good. Where are you from?

406
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:01,251
No. Listen,
I don't know shit about you,

407
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,253
so why don't you go first?

408
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,659
Me? There is nothing

409
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:12,229
to say. No story.

410
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:16,033
Well, you're the one
who wants to get chatty, bro.

411
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:35,118
Why ain't you saying anything?

412
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
Huh?

413
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:46,630
Okay. I'll start.

414
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:54,271
I am just a regular Iraqi man.

415
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:05,082
A civilian.

416
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,583
A civilian, my ass.

417
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,023
Crack bang.

418
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:15,692
One, two, three, four, five.

419
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:17,527
Okay.

420
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,563
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.

421
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:22,032
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, bang.

422
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:25,435
Four plus four.

423
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:28,438
Four plus four, 800.

424
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,140
Plus...

425
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,717
Okay.

426
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:45,322
Bullet.

427
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:47,724
45, 50, 60.

428
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:51,361
60-degree angle.

429
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,363
Nine, 950...

430
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,365
950 plus...

431
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,607
That gives me...

432
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,609
1,500.

433
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,188
Okay. Okay.

434
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,791
Got the wall,

435
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:23,794
me, Matthews.

436
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:37,774
Crane, construction site,

437
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:40,710
trailers, flagpole.

438
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:42,779
And you?

439
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:44,548
What about me?

440
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:49,319
Are you a regular American?

441
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:53,290
Uh, yeah, a regular Joe.

442
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:56,226
A regular g.I. Joe.

443
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,766
Army ranger or marine?

444
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,637
You worked in our
fucking ranks, huh?

445
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,374
Had our training, and then
you fucking backstab us.

446
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:15,312
Look, these fucking guys
were building pipelines.

447
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:18,548
Building up your fucking
economy, you asshole.

448
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,854
Pipelines, huh?

449
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:26,857
For our economy?

450
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:29,392
Yeah, that's fucking money.

451
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:33,130
Infrastructure,
education, schools.

452
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,465
These guys
were fucking contractors.

453
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,200
Not here to fight.

454
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,202
War's over, bro.

455
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:41,538
Bro?

456
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,540
Whatever, man.

457
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:46,510
It's an interesting
choice of words.

458
00:35:46,512 --> 00:35:49,279
And yet I disagree
with you, bro.

459
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:51,281
The war's not over.

460
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,652
Definitely not for you.

461
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,293
You say, you say a lot
of fucking fancy words.

462
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:04,628
What are you, ha...

463
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,597
Hajji Shakespeare or some shit?

464
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,167
Shakespeare?

465
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,536
Military lingo is all poetry.

466
00:36:12,538 --> 00:36:15,338
Battle rattle, ghetto grip...

467
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,542
Johnny jihad, friendly fire.

468
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:35,358
- Your turn, Isaac.

469
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,361
Or should I say "Ize"?

470
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,300
What?

471
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:45,702
What-what do you mean it's my
turn? What you want me to say?

472
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,504
- Tell me where you're from.

473
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,306
Where's your family?

474
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:51,441
I'm not talking
about fucking family.

475
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:54,711
Oh, god.

476
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,620
Okay, then tell me about your
brothers and sisters at arms.

477
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:05,789
That's a negative, too, bro.

478
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:08,992
I don't want any military
secrets, just stories.

479
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:11,228
Eat a dick.

480
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,230
I will shoot Matthews
if you don't talk.

481
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:14,698
Go ahead.

482
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,567
- Yes?

483
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,672
He is your second loss.

484
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:26,409
First Dean, now Matthews.

485
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,011
How the fuck
do you know about Dean?

486
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:30,680
- Keep talking.
- No, fuck you. How?

487
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:35,018
You carry his scope around.

488
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,020
What was it your sergeant said?

489
00:37:37,022 --> 00:37:39,022
"A dead man's scope"?

490
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:47,697
Oh, you...

491
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,371
Just tell me something, Isaac.

492
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:56,740
Tell me about your comrades.

493
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:59,409
Or I will shoot
Matthews' face off.

494
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:03,680
Okay.

495
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,490
Uh... yeah.

496
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:16,960
Uh, we, uh... we play ball.

497
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,895
- I beg your pardon?

498
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:21,498
Uh... yeah, no, me, uh...

499
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,967
Me and the squad, we, uh...
We play in the afternoon.

500
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:27,504
Uh, uh, get baked
in the Iraqi sun.

501
00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:30,674
Uh... nothing else to do.

502
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:32,075
No war to fight.

503
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:34,077
"Baked"?

504
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,414
- What does that mean?

505
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:41,484
Baked, like, uh,
you know, tanned.

506
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,461
Go on.

507
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:54,064
Go on?

508
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,701
What about sergeant Matthews?

509
00:38:57,703 --> 00:38:59,436
Did he get baked?

510
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:06,042
Did Dean?

511
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:08,078
I ain't talking
about fucking Dean with you,

512
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,880
you dirty fucking hajji.

513
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:14,484
If I were you,
I would start talking, Isaac.

514
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:16,786
Tell me about Dean.

515
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,989
What's the obsession, huh?

516
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,658
What the fuck?

517
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,526
It's interesting to me...

518
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:27,397
The bond
between you and your brothers.

519
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,437
And I will shoot Matthews
if you do not speak.

520
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:36,439
I'm looking at him right now.

521
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:41,544
It would be so easy
to tear his face off.

522
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,747
- His family won't even
recognize him. -

523
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:46,616
is that what you want, Ize?

524
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,429
You should just answer
my questions.

525
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:03,833
All right, all right.

526
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,484
So, tell me about Dean's scope.

527
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:26,156
Oh, fuck.

528
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:29,159
I can see it at the base
of the wall there.

529
00:40:29,161 --> 00:40:31,027
Why do you keep it?

530
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:33,096
Fuck.

531
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,141
You said it's broken.

532
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,944
Why would you carry around
a broken scope, Isaac?

533
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:51,181
Oh, shut the fuck up, man.

534
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:52,649
How's this end?

535
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:54,818
How the fuck's this end?

536
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,620
I'm sorry?

537
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,491
I said, how the fuck's it end?

538
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:03,626
What's the fucking endgame?

539
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,495
There's no endgame.

540
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:07,697
I'm just enjoying
our conversation.

541
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:10,099
Oh, stop.
Fucking stop, all right?

542
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:12,235
You're not gonna get
to fucking know me.

543
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:14,771
But I feel
like I know you better already.

544
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:16,105
No, you fucking don't!

545
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:18,107
You don't know shit.

546
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:20,577
You're dehydrated...
I know that.

547
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,712
That's why I aimed
at your water bottle.

548
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,048
No, you didn't. You fucking
was trying to hit me.

549
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,850
No. The water bottle.

550
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,254
Nobody's that fucking accurate.

551
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:34,257
And your antenna.

552
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:36,726
No fucking way.

553
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:38,628
And your knee.

554
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,731
I know the Popliteal vein
in your leg

555
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:43,867
carries enough blood that,
no matter what kind

556
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:45,802
of bandaging you have,
you will still be sitting

557
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:48,037
in a puddle of plasma.

558
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:51,574
You're feeling fatigued,
lightheaded.

559
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:55,512
- And you will bleed out
before nightfall. -

560
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:58,515
what the fuck is going on
with this shit?

561
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:00,850
You fucker.

562
00:42:02,554 --> 00:42:05,154
You psychotic motherfucker.

563
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:07,023
What do you want from me?

564
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:10,894
Oh, fuck!

565
00:42:24,276 --> 00:42:26,276
Fucking...

566
00:42:26,278 --> 00:42:28,545
Fucking... hajji.

567
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,929
Hey, where
do you keep fucking going, huh?

568
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:48,097
No, no,

569
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:50,300
you're trying to fucking circle
my wall, ain't you?

570
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:52,635
Huh?

571
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:55,972
Trying to circle
around my wall, motherfucker?

572
00:42:55,974 --> 00:42:57,774
That's ironic.

573
00:42:57,776 --> 00:43:00,643
Yeah, I'm right, huh?

574
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,681
You say "my wall."

575
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:08,351
The very wall your country
came here to knock down,

576
00:43:08,353 --> 00:43:12,088
you now try desperately
to keep from falling.

577
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,091
Oh, you find that
fucking funny, huh?

578
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,759
You should know,

579
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,162
- that wall you're hiding behind

580
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:21,698
was actually part of a school.

581
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,001
Yeah, well, I'll piss on it.

582
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:26,869
That's what I think
about your fucking wall.

583
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:29,339
You're hiding in the shadow
of Islam.

584
00:43:29,341 --> 00:43:32,709
No, I'm hiding in the shadow
of fucking death.

585
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:35,712
I'm in the fucking shadow
of death.

586
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,328
That's got...

587
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,731
That's got to be a 20 mag.

588
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,807
Eight guys.

589
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,210
It's got to be 20 mag.

590
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,363
One in Matthews,

591
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:29,766
three in me.

592
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:42,412
That 76...

593
00:44:42,414 --> 00:44:46,816
That 7.62x51 NATO round
is U.S. issued?

594
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,020
Hey, motherfucker.

595
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:54,157
You want to talk?
Come on, man. What's up?

596
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:56,159
You want to know the weapon
I'm using.

597
00:44:56,161 --> 00:44:58,161
M24?

598
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:00,830
Mark 11?

599
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:03,766
I would prefer
an M96 windrunner any day.

600
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:05,968
I thought we were being honest.

601
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,371
I know you're using a mark 11.

602
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:11,708
No, you believe
that's what I'm using.

603
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,711
But you don't know anything
for certain.

604
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:16,846
Y-you don't know shit.

605
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:18,848
Is that how you say it?

606
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,183
- "You don't know shit"?

607
00:45:20,185 --> 00:45:22,385
Say that again.

608
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:24,220
I can't hear you.

609
00:45:25,757 --> 00:45:27,757
Okay.

610
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:29,292
You...

611
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:31,027
Don't...

612
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:32,995
Know... shit.

613
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:41,838
I don't know shit, huh?

614
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,107
Well, go on, please.

615
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:46,509
Educate me, man.

616
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:50,480
Come on, I'm listening.

617
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:56,519
You Americans,

618
00:45:56,521 --> 00:45:59,322
you think you know it all.

619
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:01,858
You think it's simple.

620
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,327
That I am your enemy.

621
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:07,930
But we are not so different,
you and I.

622
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:10,933
Yeah, except I ain't
a fucking terrorist.

623
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:13,536
And you think I am?

624
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:21,444
You are the one who has come
to another man's country.

625
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,817
- Camouflaged yourself
in his land, -

626
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:30,119
- in his soil.

627
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:35,558
No fucking way.

628
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,928
From where I'm sitting,

629
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:43,065
you look very much like
the terrorist.

630
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:52,074
You're in the fucking trash?

631
00:46:52,076 --> 00:46:54,443
No fucking way.

632
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:59,916
Unless he's a pro.

633
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,922
You're him.

634
00:47:05,924 --> 00:47:08,257
You're Juba.

635
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:11,127
The ghost.

636
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:14,096
A hundred men out there
call themselves Juba.

637
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:17,266
I'm just a man.

638
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:21,604
35 U.S. casualties,

639
00:47:21,606 --> 00:47:24,207
angel of death.

640
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:27,009
That's why they never find you.

641
00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:31,981
Damn.

642
00:47:31,983 --> 00:47:36,385
You must've been days
in that fucking shit heap.

643
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:44,460
So, we trained you, obviously.

644
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:48,531
Learn how to shoot,
trajectory, zeroing the rifle,

645
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:51,200
no reloads between shots.

646
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,536
Learned all that shit
and then betrayed us?

647
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:56,873
Depends on the angle
you look at it from.

648
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:59,141
Only one angle.

649
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:02,879
- Yes, as I'd expect you to say.

650
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:04,547
No.

651
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:08,217
Tell me you're my enemy...
Fine, I'll respect that.

652
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,219
We kill, we kill.

653
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:13,956
But say you're my friend
and shoot me in the back,

654
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:17,026
the only angle I see
is a fucking snake.

655
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:20,630
But if this friend shoots you
in the back and you survive,

656
00:48:20,632 --> 00:48:23,633
is it okay to shoot him back?

657
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:32,241
I want you
to tell me something, Isaac.

658
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:35,378
Why are you here?

659
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,648
Why are you still here, Isaac?

660
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,953
How many tours
have you done now?

661
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:48,124
Why do you keep coming back?

662
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:55,264
Ooh.

663
00:48:58,069 --> 00:48:59,936
Is it because of Dean?

664
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:01,938
You've got to...

665
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,941
How the fuck did I get here?

666
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,544
Is that why?

667
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:10,680
Be honest with me, Isaac.

668
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:13,015
Is it because of Dean?

669
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:19,622
- Just tell me...

670
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:22,625
How... did you know...

671
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:26,228
How'd you know that name?

672
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,565
Tell me one thing about him.

673
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:31,267
Just one thing.

674
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:42,411
We were from around
about the same area.

675
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:44,747
His cousins...

676
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:48,284
Went to the same school as me.

677
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:51,220
My dad knows his...

678
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:54,090
Seen his kid.

679
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:58,027
Held him.

680
00:49:58,029 --> 00:50:01,030
More than Dean's ever done.

681
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,536
Clem works
by the fucking stop n' shop.

682
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:10,606
Clem?

683
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:12,608
Clementine, his wife.

684
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:18,214
No fucking way. I can't...

685
00:50:18,216 --> 00:50:20,149
I c...
I can't go back to that.

686
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:23,285
Fucking day in, day out shit.

687
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:25,287
And them looking at me.

688
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:29,692
And they would. They...

689
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:33,629
They'd look at me and they'd...

690
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:36,632
They'd see me.

691
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:41,170
Fuck.

692
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:43,172
Nope.

693
00:50:43,174 --> 00:50:45,508
I can't go... I can't...

694
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:48,711
I can't do that.
I can't go back.

695
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:55,317
Oh, my god.

696
00:50:57,522 --> 00:50:59,722
Fuck.

697
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:14,270
You happy now, huh?

698
00:51:14,272 --> 00:51:16,605
Now you know everything.

699
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,075
You're fucked up, you know that?

700
00:51:19,077 --> 00:51:20,743
Why is that?

701
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:24,413
'Cause you got to mess
with my fucking head, too.

702
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:37,626
Isaac, when this is over,

703
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:41,497
the skin will be cut
from your face.

704
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,368
Your eyes will be gouged.

705
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:49,238
Fucking shoot me, you prick.

706
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,442
Your lying tongue
will be stapled to your chest.

707
00:51:56,647 --> 00:52:00,649
Just fucking shoot me,
man. Get it over with.

708
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:03,119
But I will let them find
your body.

709
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:06,122
Fuck it,
I might just shoot myself.

710
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,513
All right, you asshole,

711
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:06,515
where are you?

712
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,411
Okay.

713
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:42,818
All right,
you stupid motherfucker.

714
00:53:44,322 --> 00:53:46,689
Bite on this,
you fucking hajji bitch.

715
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:56,365
Come on, show me something.

716
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:57,766
Send it, bitch.

717
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:44,940
Fuck.

718
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,013
Oh, fuck, aah.

719
00:57:24,542 --> 00:57:26,675
Oh, shit.

720
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:28,477
Oh, fuck!

721
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,258
That was foolish, Isaac.

722
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:51,226
I could've shot you.

723
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:53,228
I could've easily shot you.

724
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,035
Ize.

725
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:04,673
I just want to have
a conversation with you, Isaac.

726
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:13,649
Why are you trying
to get yourself killed?

727
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:37,940
Isaac, are you there?

728
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:50,719
Oh, fuck.

729
00:59:57,995 --> 01:00:00,896
Isaac. Isaac.

730
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:03,065
The radio
you risked your life for...

731
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:05,067
It's dead.

732
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:10,339
Are you dead, too?

733
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:13,308
You missed. I'm still here.

734
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:15,243
You're not that fucking good.

735
01:00:15,245 --> 01:00:16,945
He speaks!

736
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:19,314
Tear up the planks.
Hear, hear.

737
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:22,017
It is the beating
of his hideous heart.

738
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:24,953
What's that, one of your
gay-ass hajji poems?

739
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,221
American.

740
01:00:26,223 --> 01:00:29,958
"Tell-tale heart."

741
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,793
Edgar Allan Poe.

742
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:34,329
I didn't catch a fucking word
you're saying, man.

743
01:00:34,331 --> 01:00:37,899
Edgar Allan Poe. Don't you...

744
01:00:37,901 --> 01:00:40,769
What's wrong with your fucking
radio, man? What is that?

745
01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:42,871
You must've studied his work.

746
01:00:42,873 --> 01:00:45,140
He's an American great.

747
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:47,876
Writing is really...

748
01:00:47,878 --> 01:00:51,346
What is it?
Not doing a fucking thing.

749
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:53,348
Did you know
that he was an orphan?

750
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,986
He tried to be a soldier,
but didn't get very...

751
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,228
Shane. Shane, is that you?

752
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,929
He was a better writer

753
01:01:07,931 --> 01:01:09,131
than a soldier.

754
01:01:12,036 --> 01:01:15,704
"Once upon a midnight dreary,

755
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:19,775
"while I pondered,
weak and weary...

756
01:01:19,777 --> 01:01:22,711
- Sar'nt Matthews!
- "Suddenly there came...

757
01:01:22,713 --> 01:01:26,081
- "A tapping, rapping...
- Is that you?

758
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:29,084
"At my chamber door.

759
01:01:29,086 --> 01:01:32,254
"And there stepped
a stately raven

760
01:01:32,256 --> 01:01:36,091
from the saintly days of yore."

761
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:41,296
"Take thy beak from
out of my heart,

762
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:44,866
"and take thy form
from off my door.

763
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:48,036
Quoth the raven, 'nevermore.'"

764
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:57,079
or perhaps you would prefer
Robert frost?

765
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:01,750
"A voice said...

766
01:02:01,752 --> 01:02:05,153
"'Look me in the stars...

767
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:07,255
- I see you, man!
- "'...And tell me truly,

768
01:02:07,257 --> 01:02:10,392
- "'men of earth...
- I knew you were taking a nap!

769
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:13,261
"'...if all the soul
and body scars...

770
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:15,263
I found that fucking weasel.

771
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:16,898
Were not too
much to pay for birth.'"

772
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,767
12 o'clock.

773
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:21,770
In the fucking trash heap.

774
01:02:21,772 --> 01:02:24,806
His poetry is so beautiful.

775
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,185
Fu...

776
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:43,525
Shit.

777
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:47,062
So, uh, you studied, huh?

778
01:02:47,064 --> 01:02:50,766
Uh... studied, uh...

779
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:54,903
You studied here or abroad?

780
01:02:54,905 --> 01:02:57,239
Like, um, I know
they got those, uh,

781
01:02:57,241 --> 01:02:59,908
study abroad programs
or whatnot.

782
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:06,081
Shane!
A shot from that distance,

783
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:07,549
he's got to be at least

784
01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:11,453
25, 30 feet up, man.

785
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:13,522
We're talking 1,500 meters.

786
01:03:13,524 --> 01:03:15,490
1,550 maybe.

787
01:03:15,492 --> 01:03:17,993
Right? Huh?

788
01:03:17,995 --> 01:03:19,494
Why ain't you talking, man?

789
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:21,997
Come on, you there?

790
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:24,800
Ah, fuck.

791
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:26,802
Fuck.

792
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,339
Are you there, man?

793
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:36,812
It's just, you know, uh,

794
01:03:36,814 --> 01:03:38,380
you know a lot
about books and shit.

795
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:40,882
I just thought I might even

796
01:03:40,884 --> 01:03:44,085
learn some hajji Shakespeare
or some shit.

797
01:03:44,087 --> 01:03:45,554
Shakespeare?

798
01:03:45,556 --> 01:03:47,556
Is that the only poet you know?

799
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,895
I studied English.

800
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:56,131
What, you, uh...

801
01:03:56,133 --> 01:03:58,366
You minor in sniping
or something?

802
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:01,336
I was a teacher in Baghdad,

803
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:03,505
but a bomb hit my school.

804
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:06,842
Hey, you got it? Shane.

805
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:09,110
I got shrapnel
in my left elbow. Still hurts.

806
01:04:09,112 --> 01:04:12,514
Fucking trash heap
behind the white trailer.

807
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:14,182
1,550.

808
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:16,885
It reminds me
of the students I lost.

809
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:18,987
Go on, baby.

810
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:20,622
Go on, baby, let's do this.

811
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:25,327
Is that why
you shoot civilian contractors?

812
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:30,632
As the scripture says,
an eye for an eye.

813
01:04:30,634 --> 01:04:33,168
That's bullshit.

814
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:36,404
You're no more religious
than I am, man.

815
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:40,542
That's just a fucking excuse
to shoot up some Americans.

816
01:04:40,544 --> 01:04:43,278
You're good, man.

817
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,882
Just keep going slow,
baby, real slow.

818
01:04:46,884 --> 01:04:48,583
- Is that a question, Isaac?
- Slow is smooth,

819
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:51,019
smooth is fast.

820
01:04:51,021 --> 01:04:54,890
Yeah, that's right.

821
01:04:58,128 --> 01:05:01,196
You see,
that's what I don't get.

822
01:05:01,198 --> 01:05:05,367
How's an educated person like
you become a fucking terrorist?

823
01:05:08,105 --> 01:05:10,505
You tell me.

824
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:13,375
Oh, shut your fucking mouth.

825
01:05:13,377 --> 01:05:15,977
You're fading, Isaac.

826
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:19,247
You like to hear
yourself talk, don't you?

827
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:22,417
I'm fucking fantastic.

828
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:25,020
Chilling like a villain, baby.

829
01:05:25,022 --> 01:05:27,322
You are not fantastic.

830
01:05:27,324 --> 01:05:29,257
You have no water.

831
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:32,494
You're dehydrated.

832
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:34,195
The sun is...

833
01:05:34,197 --> 01:05:37,999
The sun's baking you.

834
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:41,569
You're bleeding to death.

835
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:56,551
Cap...

836
01:05:56,553 --> 01:05:58,453
Captain...

837
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,021
Captain Albright.

838
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:01,256
What's that?

839
01:06:01,258 --> 01:06:03,591
A legend.

840
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:06,294
Trained me.
Trained Dean, too.

841
01:06:07,698 --> 01:06:09,531
He's coming for us.

842
01:06:09,533 --> 01:06:11,199
For your bodies.

843
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:13,435
When we don't report in,
he's on your ass.

844
01:06:13,437 --> 01:06:15,437
Judging from your
and Matthews' performances,

845
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:17,038
I'm not concerned.

846
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,406
Fuck you.

847
01:06:18,408 --> 01:06:20,408
He's coming for us.

848
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:31,286
He trained us.

849
01:06:31,288 --> 01:06:34,356
Trained us to survive.

850
01:06:34,358 --> 01:06:37,525
And won't he be disappointed?

851
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:41,329
You didn't win shit.

852
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:44,299
You hear me, motherfucker?

853
01:06:44,301 --> 01:06:47,002
- You didn't win shit.

854
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:53,174
From a place you will not see...

855
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:55,777
Comes a sound you will not hear.

856
01:06:55,779 --> 01:06:58,580
Just a flash of fucking light.

857
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:02,384
Boom.

858
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:12,060
When I'm done with you
and Matthews,

859
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:14,596
everyone will know
who the winner is.

860
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,382
Shane!

861
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:38,820
Hold still, man, hold still.

862
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:49,064
Should I take
sergeant Matthews' head off?

863
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:50,331
Shit.

864
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,200
Hold still, man.

865
01:07:52,202 --> 01:07:53,735
- Don't fucking move.
- Will you take something

866
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:55,236
from Matthews?

867
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:56,671
Like your broken scope?

868
01:07:56,673 --> 01:08:00,175
He's in my crosshairs right now.

869
01:08:00,177 --> 01:08:03,144
I've got eyes on him.

870
01:08:03,146 --> 01:08:04,779
What?

871
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:07,348
I don't make
empty threats, Isaac.

872
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:11,119
I'm going to tear his face off.

873
01:08:11,121 --> 01:08:12,854
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

874
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:16,191
I carry around the scope
because it reminds me

875
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:17,859
why I can't hold a Sc...

876
01:08:17,861 --> 01:08:20,628
Hold a rifle again.

877
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:26,334
Okay?

878
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:30,405
You listening to me?

879
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:31,873
Dean dropped it,

880
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:34,309
the scope, in the line of duty.

881
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:36,578
He fell over trying
to pick it up and I missed...

882
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:37,779
I missed the sniper, okay?

883
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:40,615
You fucking listening to me?!

884
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:42,684
I didn't see him.
That's how he got hit.

885
01:08:42,686 --> 01:08:44,219
It was my fault.

886
01:08:44,221 --> 01:08:46,421
Goddamn it,
you fucking listening?!

887
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:02,770
No. Slower, man.

888
01:09:02,772 --> 01:09:04,205
Slower, slower.

889
01:09:04,207 --> 01:09:05,840
Slower what?

890
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,178
- What's going on?

891
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:14,816
Who are you talking to?

892
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:20,688
Who am I talking to?

893
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:24,459
- I'm talking to fucking god!

894
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,765
He's 30 feet up

895
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:32,700
in the trash somewhere!

896
01:09:32,702 --> 01:09:35,203
I don't fucking know.

897
01:09:35,205 --> 01:09:37,739
I'm sorry, man.

898
01:09:37,741 --> 01:09:40,608
Give me Max plus four!

899
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:44,579
Six mils right!

900
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:48,650
Send when ready!

901
01:09:48,652 --> 01:09:49,918
Fuck.

902
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:01,829
Did you get him?

903
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:03,398
Please tell me you got him.

904
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:03,398
Aah!

905
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:07,769
- Oh, fuck.
- Fuck!

906
01:10:07,771 --> 01:10:10,838
- You bastard. You fucking...
- Oh, fuck me.

907
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,474
Just fucking let him go,
you piece of shit!

908
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:17,278
Shane, get up, man!

909
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,713
He ain't a threat
to you anymore.

910
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:21,816
- Just fucking let him go.
- Oh, goddamn it.

911
01:10:21,818 --> 01:10:24,953
- Don't fucking stop! Don't fucking stop!
- Fuck, fuck.

912
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:29,390
Just like that.
Just like that, baby. Just go!

913
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:32,393
Fuck. Come on, man! Move!

914
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:39,234
Keep coming, man!
You're almost there!

915
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:47,308
Come on.
Just like that, man.

916
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:52,780
Reach for me.
Reach for me!

917
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:17,005
Why? Why?

918
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:31,853
I want to go home!

919
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:34,589
I want to go fucking home,
motherfucker.

920
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:36,457
So go.

921
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:37,725
Walk away.

922
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,761
You'll just fucking shoot me.

923
01:11:39,763 --> 01:11:41,062
No, I won't.

924
01:11:41,064 --> 01:11:42,964
Yes, you fucking will.

925
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:44,666
Why wouldn't you?

926
01:11:44,668 --> 01:11:47,068
Because that's not really
what you want.

927
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:49,771
What?

928
01:11:49,773 --> 01:11:51,773
You don't want
to go home, do you?

929
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,612
The fuck's that mean, man?

930
01:11:57,614 --> 01:11:58,813
The war's over.

931
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,682
You're still here.

932
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:06,454
Why?

933
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:25,406
I killed him.

934
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:30,011
I did.

935
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:32,547
He went to go confirm a kill.

936
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:34,582
Enemy sniper.

937
01:12:34,584 --> 01:12:36,417
The guy was playing possum.

938
01:12:36,419 --> 01:12:38,052
Started shooting at Dean.

939
01:12:38,054 --> 01:12:40,494
I tried shooting back, but the
bullet went right through Dean.

940
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,067
Oh, man, I lied!

941
01:12:53,069 --> 01:12:55,570
I fucking lied so much!

942
01:12:57,473 --> 01:13:00,775
Trying to keep
the story straight.

943
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:07,448
I lied to everybody.

944
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:10,952
I lied to every single person,
except you, a fucking hajj!

945
01:13:35,812 --> 01:13:37,545
Are you there?

946
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:42,650
You listening to me?

947
01:13:42,652 --> 01:13:44,419
Do you hear me?

948
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:47,588
Where are you, man?

949
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,525
Where do you keep going?

950
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:04,705
No, something's off.

951
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:11,038
Spartan
33, this is mobile HQ actual.

952
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:15,977
Spartan thirty tree,
this is mobile HQ actual.

953
01:15:18,114 --> 01:15:20,882
This is spartan 33!
How copy?

954
01:15:20,884 --> 01:15:22,717
Spartan 33 confirmed.

955
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:24,719
- Name and rank?
- Sar'nt a...

956
01:15:24,721 --> 01:15:26,554
Sergeant Allen b. Isaac.

957
01:15:26,556 --> 01:15:27,922
Affirm.

958
01:15:27,924 --> 01:15:29,056
Good to hear you again, Sar'nt.

959
01:15:29,058 --> 01:15:31,158
What the fuck?

960
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,894
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Hey, cap, cap!

961
01:15:32,896 --> 01:15:35,263
Any sign of the
shooter in the last hour?

962
01:15:35,265 --> 01:15:37,131
No, still quiet.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

963
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:39,000
We're chilling
like villains, cap.

964
01:15:39,002 --> 01:15:41,235
Cap, cap, cap! This is
Sar'nt Allen b. Isaac...

965
01:15:41,237 --> 01:15:42,703
What's Matthews' status?

966
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,805
He's stable, sir.

967
01:15:44,807 --> 01:15:46,908
No, no!

968
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:48,142
Captain Albright!

969
01:15:48,144 --> 01:15:50,177
All due respect, cap,

970
01:15:50,179 --> 01:15:52,079
that's what y'all said
an hour ago.

971
01:15:52,081 --> 01:15:55,583
Can I get an updated eta?

972
01:15:55,585 --> 01:15:57,285
Eta about an hour 20.

973
01:15:57,287 --> 01:15:58,886
Copy that.

974
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:00,321
Fuck. Don't do this, man.

975
01:16:00,323 --> 01:16:01,956
We're getting baked out here.

976
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:03,558
- Little out of it.
- Hang in there, boys.

977
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,693
We'll be approaching

978
01:16:05,695 --> 01:16:09,230
grid hotel whiskey 7203

979
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:13,200
in approximately 6-0 Mikes.

980
01:16:13,202 --> 01:16:14,902
Had to detour due to hostiles.

981
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:16,871
That guy called for us.

982
01:16:16,873 --> 01:16:18,973
Fucking hajjis.

983
01:16:18,975 --> 01:16:20,808
Just hoping you get here
before nightfall.

984
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:23,844
Scared of the dark now, boys?

985
01:16:23,846 --> 01:16:25,980
How many times you done this,
you motherfucker?

986
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:29,650
Could've fooled me.

987
01:16:29,652 --> 01:16:32,653
Sure you don't need a little
vagisil for the problem areas?

988
01:16:32,655 --> 01:16:35,656
Construction guys
call for security detail.

989
01:16:35,658 --> 01:16:38,259
Security detail calls for us,
and I...

990
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:41,128
- I call for them.
- I hear that.

991
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:42,930
We'll see you in 80...

992
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:45,266
Camouflage yourself in me,
you fuck.

993
01:16:45,268 --> 01:16:47,301
We'll do our best, cap.

994
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:48,736
Over and out.

995
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,739
Out.

996
01:16:51,741 --> 01:16:52,940
Fuck you.

997
01:16:54,242 --> 01:16:56,844
Oh, fuck you...

998
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:16,998

999
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,733
- Hey, damn it!

1000
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:49,063
Hey, you fucking there?

1001
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:53,034
You can't shoot them.

1002
01:17:53,036 --> 01:17:54,268
You know that, right?

1003
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:56,937
You shoot, you give away
your position.

1004
01:17:56,939 --> 01:18:00,041
And they'll fucking find you.

1005
01:18:00,043 --> 01:18:01,375
They will.

1006
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:05,813
You listening to me?

1007
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:13,054
You there?

1008
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:12,273
Fuck.

1009
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,044
I'm gonna shut you the fuck up.

1010
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:34,461
Ah.

1011
01:21:41,596 --> 01:21:44,098

01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:47,568
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1013
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:07,414
Spread out!
Secure the perimeter!

1014
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:09,283
Go, go!

1015
01:23:09,285 --> 01:23:11,251
Casualty, 10 o'clock.

1016
01:23:11,253 --> 01:23:14,121
Sergeant Isaac.
All right, go, move it!

1017
01:23:14,123 --> 01:23:15,656
The trash. He's in...

1018
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:17,057
It's all gonna be okay.

1019
01:23:17,059 --> 01:23:18,325
Two friendlies!
Got two friendlies!

1020
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,527
We got you. Just breathe.

1021
01:23:20,529 --> 01:23:23,097
- He's in the trash.
- You're gonna be all right.

1022
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:26,200
All clear! Perimeter clear!

1023
01:23:49,091 --> 01:23:51,425
Bulldog 1-7, wheel's up.

1024
01:23:51,427 --> 01:23:54,028
3-5, wheel's up.

1025
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:56,263
Bulldog flight...

1026
01:23:57,632 --> 01:24:00,667
Coming right, heading 2-3-0.

1027
01:24:00,669 --> 01:24:02,569
3-5, copy.

1028
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:10,177
Try to relax, sergeant.

1029
01:24:10,179 --> 01:24:12,379
You're gonna be all right.

1030
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:21,388
Just relax. Just relax.

1031
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:22,723
I've set up the oxygen.

1032
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:24,124
He's going through it
pretty fast

1033
01:24:24,126 --> 01:24:25,559
so prep the backup tank.

1034
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:27,361
We'll reset in five Mikes.

1035
01:24:27,363 --> 01:24:29,396
You got that? Five Mikes.

1036
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,665
Copy that.

1037
01:24:33,202 --> 01:24:34,435
What?

1038
01:24:34,437 --> 01:24:36,570
- Holy shit!
- We're taking fire!

1039
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:38,672
Where the fuck's it coming from?

1040
01:24:38,674 --> 01:24:41,575
He's in the trash!
- Lie down! Lie down!

1041
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,510

1042
01:24:43,512 --> 01:24:45,746
- He's in the fucking trash!
- Hold on!

1043
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:47,581
He's in the trash!

1044
01:24:55,391 --> 01:24:57,424
Under fire! Under fire!

1045
01:24:57,426 --> 01:24:58,725
Brace! Brace!

1046
01:24:58,727 --> 01:25:01,562
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

1047
01:25:01,564 --> 01:25:03,797
We're going down!

1048
01:25:12,575 --> 01:25:15,209
Helo bulldog 1-7,

01:25:15,211 --> 01:25:16,810
Helo bulldog 3-5.

1050
01:25:16,812 --> 01:25:20,514
This is Baghdad command.

01:25:20,516 --> 01:25:23,317
Bulldog 1-7, how copy?

1052
01:25:27,323 --> 01:25:28,722
This is bulldog 1-7.

1053
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:30,390
Reading you Lima Charlie.

1054
01:25:30,392 --> 01:25:32,159
Over.
