1
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:33,424
Once upon a time, in the little village
of Pudding-on-the-Ritz...

2
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,264
there lived a wolf named Phox.

3
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:39,932
That's Phox with a ''PH.'' P-H-O-X.
My card.

4
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,599
There was no one so clever
at driving a bargain.

5
00:00:41,676 --> 00:00:44,440
This horse is exactly what you need,
Grandpa.

6
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:47,709
Got a three-speed bridle,
matching horse shoes, wide sidewalls.

7
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:49,977
lt's a steal at 40 pazoozas.

8
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:53,111
- Can l look at its teeth?
- Teeth? Teeth?

9
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,452
You buying a horse or a beauty queen?
Come on, now.

10
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:59,459
Well, all right.
Here's your money.

11
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:02,721
And here's your horse!

12
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:04,890
Well, come on, horsie.

13
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:09,069
Hey! l wanted a live horse!

14
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:11,901
lt was alive--
but l didn't say when.

15
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:16,273
Nobody liked the Phox with a ''PH,'' but
nobody could ever get the better of him.

16
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:19,404
One day, the sly Phox was tripping
through the woods...

17
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:22,240
Oh, hardy, har, har.

18
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,342
when he chanced upon a mysterious box
sitting in an open glade.

19
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,614
On its top was written
this strange legend.

20
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,918
''To take my treasure you may try...

21
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:33,483
but he who opens me shall die!''
A treasure chest!

22
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:35,324
Gadzooks, l'm in luck!

23
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:37,591
But whoever opens it shall die.

24
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:40,429
Ergo, l got to get some dummy
to open it for me.

25
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,435
But who would be that much
of a nitwit?

26
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,278
Desmond Dullwit wasn't exactly
the village idiot.

27
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:57,944
- But l came in second.
- Desmond, old buddy!

28
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:00,544
l need somebody to open a box for me.

29
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:04,387
No, you don't.
Whoever opens that box is gonna die.

30
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,827
- How do you know that?
- l was listening to the story.

31
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:10,830
So l ain't gonna open it.

32
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,832
But you must, Desmond.

33
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,233
That box holds a beautiful princess
who was put under a spell...

34
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:17,965
by a wicked witch, remember?

35
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,733
- Well, listen.
- Little did Desmond know...

36
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,505
that the wily Phox
was an accomplished ventriloquist.

37
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:27,047
Oh, help! Help me, Desmond!

38
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:30,083
There is somebody in there!

39
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,551
Hey, how does she know my name?

40
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,078
Why, she's been secretly
in love with you for years.

41
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:39,092
Oh, joy bells!
Hang on, honey!

42
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,424
Lover pumpkin is here!

43
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:46,895
Sainted Aunt Hannah!
Look at that!

44
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:50,768
Gold! Jewelry!
Queen Victoria's spittoon!

45
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,271
l'm rich! Rich!

46
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,775
l don't see a princess, Mr. Phox.

47
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,674
Of course not, you stupid lox.

48
00:02:57,745 --> 00:03:00,339
lt was a joke. Get it?
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

49
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:07,215
You go get yourself a big crocus sack
and we'll divide all the treasure.

50
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:10,724
Half and half, even steven, 80-20.

51
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:14,227
All right--
but l'd rather have a princess.

52
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:17,560
No sooner had Desmond gone then the wily
Phox pulled out a sack of his own...

53
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,964
and began filling it
with the priceless treasure.

54
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,058
Meanwhile...

55
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:24,536
Desmond wandered through the lavender
glen looking for a crocus sack.

56
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:27,301
There he chanced upon
a beautiful milkmaid.

57
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:29,575
Hi there, missy.

58
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:32,875
You wouldn't happen to have
an old crocus sack would you?

59
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:34,744
Why, l'm wearing one.

60
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,545
l just need it
to put my priceless treasure into.

61
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,245
Priceless treasure!

62
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,948
Just a minute, honey!

63
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:46,315
- Here you are.
- Thanks a bunch.

64
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,796
Wait for me, lover pumpkin!

65
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:53,095
The smarmy Phox had filled his sack
when he noticed one small coin...

66
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:54,395
left in the chest.

67
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,436
An lndian-head penny!

68
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:58,938
Of course the greedy Phox
had to have it.

69
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,873
Are you kiddin'? They bring
three pazoozas on the open market.

70
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:04,207
But, in reaching
for that last penny...

71
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:06,269
Phox overbalanced and--

72
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:09,715
Here l am, Mr. Phox.

73
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:12,344
Oh, lookie! He must have left
my share for me.

74
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,413
- But where'd he go?
- l'm in the box! Let me out!

75
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,391
Sure you are!

76
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,893
What a kidder.

77
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:23,055
Get me out of here!

78
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,065
Well, thanks for divvying it up
with me, Mr. Phox--

79
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,623
wherever you are.

80
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:31,229
And the stupid lox ambled off,
followed by the beautiful milkmaid.

81
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:33,603
Hold it, sugar-puss!

82
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,905
Years later, whenever anyone would ask
about the Phox with the ''PH''...

83
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:38,969
the answer was always the same.

84
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:40,343
Who cares?

85
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:44,680
As for Desmond Dullwit, he and his
beautiful wife lived happily...

86
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:47,346
to a ripe old age.

87
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:51,790
Wait a minute. The legend said
that whoever opened the box would die.

88
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:55,761
Yeah, but it didn't say when.

89
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:07,652
Once upon a time in Canada,
there unfolded a tale...

90
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,813
of heroes and villains.

91
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:14,826
And it all began with two boys,
a girl and a horse.

92
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:17,385
l don't know, Dudley.

93
00:06:17,463 --> 00:06:20,921
Choosing what you want to be when
you grow up is a very serious matter.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,332
lt's not a question
of what l want, Nell.

95
00:06:23,403 --> 00:06:27,339
lt's my destiny to become
a Royal Canadian Mountie.

96
00:06:27,407 --> 00:06:30,535
l think l'm going to have
to get out there and see the world...

97
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,168
before l choose.

98
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:34,179
What a bunch of wimps.

99
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:36,511
Why? What are you gonna be, Snidely?

100
00:06:36,582 --> 00:06:40,040
Me? lsn't it obvious?
l'm gonna be the bad guy.

101
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:42,781
- Why?
- 'Cause the bad guy has all the fun.

102
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:46,052
And if you're the bad guy,
you get to do stuff like this.

103
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:49,861
And this!

104
00:06:56,602 --> 00:06:59,196
So long, Mountie boy!

105
00:06:59,272 --> 00:07:01,206
l can ride better than that.

106
00:07:01,274 --> 00:07:03,265
l can do this better too.

107
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:06,307
Why, Dudley!

108
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:07,812
Come on, Nell.

109
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,486
Though young Nell's heart was torn
between Dudley and Snidely--

110
00:07:14,554 --> 00:07:17,114
her two very best friends
in the world--

111
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,489
Dudley's mind was filled
with nothing but visions...

112
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,154
of growing up to be a Mountie.

113
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:27,495
Of course, this surely wouldn't hurt
in his quest for the young Nell.

114
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:30,661
For a Mountie is always brave...

115
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:33,796
and strong and cool.

116
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:42,006
Let's try that again, shall we?

117
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:45,915
A Mountie is always brave
and strong and--

118
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:49,844
lt was 20 years later, and Dudley
Do-Right had fulfilled his destiny.

119
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,680
He had grown up to be
a Royal Canadian Mountie.

120
00:08:52,752 --> 00:08:56,017
And his faithful horse, Horse,
who had grown up as well...

121
00:08:56,088 --> 00:08:59,524
was the best-trained horse
this side of Ottawa.

122
00:08:59,592 --> 00:09:01,025
Fetch.

123
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,824
Okay, so he wasn't that well trained.

124
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:11,961
Still, Dudley was a member
in good standing...

125
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:14,302
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

126
00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:18,139
He had his own grown-up fort.
He had his own grown-up office.

127
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:19,940
He had indeed grown up...

128
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:23,470
to be brave and strong and cool.

129
00:09:35,228 --> 00:09:38,322
Now, Dudley's lifelong rival,
Snidely K. Whiplash...

130
00:09:38,397 --> 00:09:40,331
had fulfilled his destiny as well.

131
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,230
He had become the bad guy...

132
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:44,826
and he had brought a bunch of his
bad-guy friends with him.

133
00:09:46,472 --> 00:09:48,440
Can l help you?

134
00:09:48,507 --> 00:09:50,634
Could you wait till
everyone's in, please?

135
00:09:53,913 --> 00:09:56,347
- What's the meaning of this?
- This is a holdup.

136
00:09:56,415 --> 00:09:59,350
Now give us all your gold and all
your money or we'll shoot you.

137
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:00,942
- All of you?
- All of us!

138
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,148
No, wait.
Kevin, go and get the money.

139
00:10:04,223 --> 00:10:05,713
- Yes, sir.
- Don't forget the gold.

140
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,055
And don't forget the gold.

141
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:10,152
lt's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

142
00:10:10,229 --> 00:10:13,221
We got the money and the gold!

143
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:17,861
Let's go, boys!

144
00:10:17,937 --> 00:10:21,202
Snidely knew the call would go out
to Canada's number one Mountie.

145
00:10:21,274 --> 00:10:24,505
Too bad he was tied up
with official Mountie business.

146
00:10:25,444 --> 00:10:27,378
The anchovies go on the half
with the pepperoni...

147
00:10:27,446 --> 00:10:31,849
and then it's one-quarter garlic
and one-quarter olives.

148
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:36,377
Good. Twenty minutes?
That's it.

149
00:10:36,455 --> 00:10:38,286
Thanks, Mom.
l love you too.

150
00:10:40,293 --> 00:10:41,726
Here we go.

151
00:10:43,496 --> 00:10:46,863
Meanwhile, back at Snidely's
not-so-secret hideout--

152
00:10:46,932 --> 00:10:49,093
Here's the money,
but where's the gold?

153
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:51,193
- Whiplash took it.
- Where is Whiplash?

154
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,501
He's got to be here somewhere.

155
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:02,112
He took off with all the gold!
All we have is this measly $26,000!

156
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:04,342
We got to find Whip!
He's tricked us!

157
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:06,885
And when we do,
we're gonna kill him--

158
00:11:06,952 --> 00:11:09,477
really slowly.

159
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:11,716
- Yeah, but where is he?
- That's a good question.

160
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,453
- l heard he was in the Sudan.
- Where's that?

161
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:16,358
ln Africa, stupid.

162
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:20,126
- He's supposedly at the Hilton Hotel.
- The Hilton, eh?

163
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:22,864
Come on, boys!
Let's go get him!

164
00:11:22,935 --> 00:11:26,666
What the boys didn't know was that
it was Snidely himself who was...

165
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:29,037
sending them to the far reaches
of the world.

166
00:11:29,108 --> 00:11:32,874
Yes, he really was
a very bad guy.

167
00:11:35,614 --> 00:11:37,707
lt's all so easy.

168
00:11:38,617 --> 00:11:43,384
All you have to do is find 999...

169
00:11:43,456 --> 00:11:46,550
of the stupidest criminals
in North America...

170
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:50,425
and everything just falls into place.

171
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:56,066
There's only one man
who can stop me now.

172
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:58,603
And that one man could only be...

173
00:11:58,671 --> 00:12:01,834
Dudley Do-Right
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

174
00:12:09,348 --> 00:12:12,511
Meanwhile,
at an abandoned gold mine...

175
00:12:12,585 --> 00:12:15,349
a sinister figure lurks.

176
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:18,185
l love to lurk.
lt's so me.

177
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:24,362
Everyone knew there wasn't any gold
left in the old mine...

178
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,957
but it was part of Snidely's
evil plan to put some there.

179
00:12:42,615 --> 00:12:46,551
The old mine shaft just caved in.
l've warned those kids.

180
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:49,383
Come on. Time to go to the dark
and scary part of the forest.

181
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,885
Fine. l'll take the vehicle.

182
00:13:04,236 --> 00:13:06,170
All you kids come on out of there.

183
00:13:10,576 --> 00:13:11,907
l'm hardly a kid.

184
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:21,853
All right. Queensberry rules.
Let's go. Put 'em up.

185
00:13:21,921 --> 00:13:24,685
Ready when you are, DD.

186
00:13:24,757 --> 00:13:27,692
- Why do you have a shotgun?
- l was hunting.

187
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,024
ln an abandoned gold mine?

188
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:32,689
Yes. l was hunting for vampires.

189
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:35,029
- Vampires?
- Afraid so.

190
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,295
- Vampires.
- Believe me, Do-Right, they exist.

191
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:39,462
- l don't believe you.
- Hold this.

192
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,206
Examine, if you will,
this shell from a shotgun.

193
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:50,715
You'll notice it's not shot,
but gold instead.

194
00:13:50,783 --> 00:13:53,217
lt's well-known--
to kill a vampire...

195
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:57,153
you must drive a stake through its heart
or shoot it with a golden bullet.

196
00:13:57,223 --> 00:14:01,819
Oh. So then there really are
vampires around here?

197
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:05,660
Sadly, behind every tree, practically.

198
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,835
- What was that?
- l shudder to speculate.

199
00:14:10,903 --> 00:14:13,303
- l have to go.
- l thought you might.

200
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:14,703
So long.

201
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:20,836
And so it went. While the evil Whiplash
was out hunting vampires...

202
00:14:20,913 --> 00:14:25,350
our hero was at home, hiding
behind a cardboard Mountie cutout.

203
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:30,753
After all, even to a real Mountie,
vampires can seem awfully scary.

204
00:14:36,595 --> 00:14:38,756
Vampires indeed.

205
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:41,061
Another week and
l'll have those idiots thinking...

206
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:43,658
there's gold in them there hills.

207
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:49,864
ln the daylight hours,
Snidely was hard at work...

208
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:53,901
arranging a meeting between a really
big train and the local bank president.

209
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:59,017
ls that a choo-choo train
l hear coming our way?

210
00:14:59,084 --> 00:15:02,247
l can't do this to our customers.

211
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:04,720
You'll own everything!

212
00:15:06,158 --> 00:15:08,388
All right, all right. l'll sign.

213
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,394
All the bank's mortgages are yours.

214
00:15:10,462 --> 00:15:12,430
And a teller to be named later.

215
00:15:15,534 --> 00:15:20,597
All right! Pay off the mortgage now, or
this quaint little fixer upper is mine!

216
00:15:20,673 --> 00:15:24,074
- You're not our banker.
- l am now.

217
00:15:24,143 --> 00:15:26,134
Read it and weep.

218
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:29,040
How can you do this to us?

219
00:15:29,114 --> 00:15:31,947
How can l do this to you?
Madam, l was born to do it.

220
00:15:32,017 --> 00:15:35,418
lt's in my genes. Now get out,
and take your munchkins with you.

221
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:38,853
That's right. Chop-chop.
Single file.

222
00:15:38,924 --> 00:15:41,916
And wipe that smile off your face.
And no talking.

223
00:15:41,994 --> 00:15:45,896
With his ill-gotten gains,
Snidely Whiplash was taking over...

224
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:49,594
all of Semi-Happy Valley,
and that included the local motel...

225
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:51,898
the Slaw-Dogs stand...

226
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:53,802
the funeral home...

227
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:55,032
the very town itself.

228
00:15:55,107 --> 00:15:58,702
Naturally, local residents
became a mite concerned.

229
00:16:05,484 --> 00:16:08,248
What's going on out here?
What's wrong?

230
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,413
We've all just lost
our homes and businesses.

231
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:12,480
Yeah!

232
00:16:12,558 --> 00:16:15,425
Oh! Well, that's a relief.

233
00:16:15,494 --> 00:16:16,791
lt is?

234
00:16:16,862 --> 00:16:19,490
Yes. l thought that this was
about the vampires.

235
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:23,160
No! This is about that bloodsucker,
Snidely Whiplash.

236
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:25,829
He's taken everything--
our homes, our businesses, our farms.

237
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:28,134
- Yeah!
- What do you mean, ''vampires''?

238
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:29,640
You mean you don't know?

239
00:16:31,744 --> 00:16:33,803
- The woods are filled with them.
- What?

240
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:42,020
Our hero, Dudley Do-Right,
had never felt so alone.

241
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:44,180
Whiplash City was a ghost town.

242
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:47,191
His long-lost Nell
had been gone for years.

243
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:49,853
Now it was just him and Horse.

244
00:16:49,928 --> 00:16:51,793
lt's just you and me, Horse.

245
00:16:53,265 --> 00:16:57,361
lf l know anything, Horse,
these two things are true--

246
00:16:57,436 --> 00:16:59,028
Nell will never come back...

247
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:02,139
and you will never leave me.

248
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:40,007
Horse, where are you going?
There's vampires out there!

249
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:53,417
- Who goes there?
- What?

250
00:17:55,761 --> 00:17:58,355
Don't ''what'' me--
Don't ''what'' me!

251
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,864
l know you're a vampire.

252
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:04,369
l'm gonna warn you--
l've got garlic in here.

253
00:18:04,436 --> 00:18:07,405
lt's me, Dudley.
lt's Nell Fenwick.

254
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:10,968
Don't try and confuse me.
l know you're a vampire.

255
00:18:11,043 --> 00:18:13,136
And l can prove it too, because only
a vampire wouldn't know the answer...

256
00:18:13,212 --> 00:18:16,807
to this simple Canadian question.

257
00:18:16,882 --> 00:18:21,046
- What is Wayne Gretzky's middle name?
- Well, l don't know, Dudley.

258
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:23,079
Well, do you?

259
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:27,992
No, l don't.
Oh, my God.

260
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:34,231
- l am a vampire!
- You're not a vampire, Dudley.

261
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:35,960
ls something burning?

262
00:18:36,034 --> 00:18:39,902
Yeah, right. Like you think l'm stupid
enough to fall for that old trick.

263
00:18:51,483 --> 00:18:53,644
lt was at that precise moment
when Nell remembered...

264
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:56,017
that famous Mountie movie song.

265
00:18:56,088 --> 00:19:01,754
When l'm calling you

266
00:19:03,262 --> 00:19:04,786
lt really is you!

267
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:09,960
Will you answer too

268
00:19:10,035 --> 00:19:14,028
That means l offer my love

269
00:19:14,106 --> 00:19:15,971
To you

270
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,973
lf you refuse me

271
00:19:20,045 --> 00:19:23,879
What shall l do

272
00:19:24,883 --> 00:19:31,152
When l'm calling you

273
00:19:32,224 --> 00:19:33,714
- Won't you come in, Nell?
- Sure.

274
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,027
What have you been doing
all these years?

275
00:19:40,098 --> 00:19:43,158
l went out and saw the world,
just like l planned.

276
00:19:43,235 --> 00:19:46,136
l got my masters in philosophy
from Yale...

277
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:48,571
a Ph.D in international diplomacy
from Harvard.

278
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,336
And then l served
as US ambassador to Guam.

279
00:19:52,477 --> 00:19:53,466
And?

280
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,138
And...

281
00:19:57,082 --> 00:20:01,485
now l've come home to get the one thing
a good education can't buy.

282
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:03,817
Oh, l got you. You want one of those
fuzzy plaid blankets...

283
00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:06,517
they sell down at the Mountie store.

284
00:20:06,592 --> 00:20:09,186
- Beach house with a hot tub?
- No. l just--

285
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:11,354
Let's not play games, Nell.

286
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,421
l haven't had the chance to say
these words before and--

287
00:20:35,954 --> 00:20:39,856
When l'm calling you

288
00:20:39,925 --> 00:20:42,120
- Enough with the song.
- Got it.

289
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,029
- l'm sorry. Where was l?
- Maybe we should just go out.

290
00:20:50,102 --> 00:20:54,368
l hear they're having an authentic corn
festival dance at the reservation...

291
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:56,907
- with fireworks and everything.
- Or picture this.

292
00:20:56,975 --> 00:20:59,068
A quiet evening in front of the fire
avec moi...

293
00:20:59,144 --> 00:21:01,544
toasting marshmallows,
drinking Ovaltine.

294
00:21:01,613 --> 00:21:04,173
Oh! Now l remember
what l was going to say.

295
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:05,682
Nell Fenwick, l--

296
00:21:19,431 --> 00:21:24,391
Nell, l love you.

297
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:26,528
Though she had traveled far and wide,
never before...

298
00:21:26,605 --> 00:21:29,665
had Nell heard a confession of love
from a moose.

299
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:32,175
Let's just go to the corn festival.

300
00:21:32,244 --> 00:21:34,269
Okeydokey.

301
00:21:35,347 --> 00:21:38,043
l'll get around to fixing
the floorboards next Tuesday.

302
00:21:40,786 --> 00:21:42,720
l hope it's not hunting season.

303
00:21:49,127 --> 00:21:52,563
A little help here
for the moose? Please?

304
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:59,059
- When l'm calling you
- Thank you.

305
00:22:08,855 --> 00:22:11,289
After finding the nearest
moose head removal service...

306
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:13,952
Dudley and Nell made their way
to the corn festival.

307
00:22:14,027 --> 00:22:16,495
This is totally authentic.

308
00:22:16,563 --> 00:22:18,428
This is Canada, Nell.

309
00:22:18,498 --> 00:22:20,432
Things are real up here.

310
00:22:21,868 --> 00:22:23,995
Oh! Say, there's the chief.

311
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:26,801
Chief!

312
00:22:26,873 --> 00:22:27,897
Oh, Chief!

313
00:22:27,974 --> 00:22:30,465
Yes, it was the chief
of that rarely studied tribe...

314
00:22:30,543 --> 00:22:34,001
of South Brooklyn lndians
known as the Canarsie Kumquats...

315
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,105
or just the Kumquats, for short.

316
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,279
Long time no see.

317
00:22:39,352 --> 00:22:41,013
You remember Nell.

318
00:22:42,055 --> 00:22:45,650
Nell Fenwick! You look terrific!
How's it going?

319
00:22:45,725 --> 00:22:48,660
- Me do well.
- Good for you, sugar.

320
00:22:48,728 --> 00:22:50,821
Well, come on.
Let's go see the show.

321
00:23:24,698 --> 00:23:28,327
This Riverdance stuff
is really hot lately.

322
00:23:50,056 --> 00:23:52,490
You remember Standing Room Only,
don't you?

323
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,153
Of course l do.
How are you, Standing Room Only?

324
00:23:55,228 --> 00:23:58,197
- Great. Look, can we talk?
- Certainly.

325
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:19,016
How!

326
00:24:20,353 --> 00:24:22,844
Bravo! Oh, bravo!

327
00:24:24,023 --> 00:24:26,958
Okay, look.
A snitch l ain't, all right?

328
00:24:27,026 --> 00:24:29,756
But for the last week or so l been
seeing this guy in the woods at night...

329
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:33,230
with this kind of Abe Lincoln hat on
and this opera coat...

330
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:37,463
going around shooting rocks and streams,
crap like that, with a shotgun.

331
00:24:38,872 --> 00:24:41,705
- Yes? Go on.
- What, you don't think that's weird?

332
00:24:41,775 --> 00:24:44,300
lt's Snidely Whiplash.

333
00:24:44,377 --> 00:24:45,969
He thinks he's hunting vampires...

334
00:24:46,045 --> 00:24:48,980
with gold bullets,
which scares the heck out of me.

335
00:24:49,048 --> 00:24:52,142
- Vampires or gold bullets?
- Vampires.

336
00:24:52,218 --> 00:24:54,812
l'll tell you, Chief. l think you're
straight out of your fricking mind.

337
00:24:54,888 --> 00:24:55,877
Me or him?

338
00:24:56,723 --> 00:24:58,315
Me. Me. Me.

339
00:25:00,326 --> 00:25:03,261
Yeah. Well, that's a fine way
to talk to your chief.

340
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:06,890
lf you'll excuse me,
this particular Mountie has a date.

341
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:20,070
Oh, Dudley, l wish we could have stayed
for the fireworks.

342
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:23,946
Fireworks are even more beautiful
from this vantage point.

343
00:25:24,017 --> 00:25:24,949
Yes.

344
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:27,782
When l'm calling you

345
00:25:27,854 --> 00:25:28,786
- Dudley?
- Yes, Nell?

346
00:25:28,855 --> 00:25:30,789
- Not now, okay?
- Yes, Nell.

347
00:25:30,857 --> 00:25:33,485
- Let's just row.
- Of course, Nell.

348
00:25:37,697 --> 00:25:41,463
Meanwhile, that very same night,
the poorest man in Semi-Happy Valley...

349
00:25:41,534 --> 00:25:43,798
was about to strike it rich.

350
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,360
Hello!

351
00:25:45,438 --> 00:25:47,531
Enjoying your evening thus far?

352
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:50,872
Thought l'd just drop in.
Found some gold, have we?

353
00:25:52,712 --> 00:25:55,306
There's no gold anywhere
around here.

354
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:57,178
Oh, but there is.
Lots of it.

355
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,744
All over the place. And you,
you horrid example of a human being...

356
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:03,846
have made the initial discovery.

357
00:26:03,923 --> 00:26:07,984
You're famous.
You will be on network television.

358
00:26:08,061 --> 00:26:09,756
Network television?

359
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:11,057
No way!

360
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,890
Now stand up,
hold the pan out and smile.

361
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:16,128
Can l-- Can l borrow your comb?

362
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:17,829
Shut up and grin.

363
00:26:26,513 --> 00:26:29,209
- Welcome to our show. Have a seat.
- Hi. How are you?

364
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,110
They're calling this the biggest
gold strike in history.

365
00:26:33,186 --> 00:26:36,121
Certainly it's the biggest gold find
of the century.

366
00:26:36,189 --> 00:26:39,124
And the man who made it all possible
is here for an exclusive interview.

367
00:26:39,192 --> 00:26:41,660
Mr. Kim J. Darling.
Welcome, Kim.

368
00:26:44,531 --> 00:26:47,125
- What's happening, Regis?
- l'll tell you what's happening.

369
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,998
You're what's happening.
Headlines all over the world.

370
00:26:50,069 --> 00:26:53,470
How's it feel to have made the biggest
gold find in a century?

371
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,270
Well, l-- l feel lightheaded,
Kathie Lee.

372
00:26:56,342 --> 00:26:58,867
Your story certainly has taken
the whole world by storm.

373
00:26:58,945 --> 00:27:01,743
But Reg, the sad part is--
at least for Kim--

374
00:27:01,814 --> 00:27:04,339
is that he found all this gold...

375
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:07,386
- on land he doesn't own.
- l did?

376
00:27:07,453 --> 00:27:09,080
But the owner is staking no claim.

377
00:27:09,155 --> 00:27:11,589
He says whoever finds the gold
gets to keep it.

378
00:27:11,658 --> 00:27:14,889
And that's why the big gold rush
is on for northern Canada.

379
00:27:17,096 --> 00:27:19,894
Stay tuned. Bette Midler is next.

380
00:27:19,966 --> 00:27:22,196
- No!
- Yeah.

381
00:27:24,337 --> 00:27:27,363
Meanwhile, on the US-Canadian border...

382
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,374
all is tranquil, as usual.

383
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:31,342
You want some of me?

384
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,115
You want some of Dwayne Cuffman?

385
00:27:38,518 --> 00:27:39,951
Come on!

386
00:27:57,704 --> 00:27:59,137
Passports!

387
00:27:59,205 --> 00:28:02,231
Hey, stop-- What--
l must see your passports!

388
00:28:04,177 --> 00:28:07,613
Trouble along the Canadian-US border
continues to mount.

389
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,114
They seem to be yuppie wetbacks,
mostly...

390
00:28:10,183 --> 00:28:12,515
- but a lot of them are dentists.
- And this just in.

391
00:28:12,585 --> 00:28:15,486
Scientists discovered that Canadian
bacon is actually ordinary ham.

392
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:21,588
What could be better than a plan
working exactly as you planned it?

393
00:28:21,661 --> 00:28:22,923
Nothing.

394
00:28:22,996 --> 00:28:24,429
That's what's better.

395
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:27,466
Drop it, Whiplash.

396
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:30,525
- lt's about time you showed up.
- About time?

397
00:28:30,603 --> 00:28:32,594
We're here to kill you.

398
00:28:32,672 --> 00:28:36,768
That won't be necessary.
Gentlemen, forgive my manners.

399
00:28:36,843 --> 00:28:38,811
Please, take a seat.

400
00:28:43,016 --> 00:28:46,042
- You weren't in the Sudan.
- You don't say.

401
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:49,020
- Where are all the other men?
- Where are they?

402
00:28:49,088 --> 00:28:53,718
They're all over the place--
Heathrow, the Rome airport, Mozambique--

403
00:28:54,861 --> 00:28:56,852
We all ran out of money.

404
00:28:56,929 --> 00:29:00,956
This could be the right-sized group
l've been looking for.

405
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:02,524
What are you talking about?
We're going to kill you.

406
00:29:02,602 --> 00:29:05,901
You're not going to kill me.
You're going to work for me.

407
00:29:05,972 --> 00:29:10,500
Yeah. l need you boys
to help me run the town.

408
00:29:10,576 --> 00:29:15,570
Everyone's gone, including the man
who ran the Slaw-Dogs stand.

409
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:19,709
Therefore, boys,
l'm gonna need your help...

410
00:29:19,786 --> 00:29:21,310
to run Whiplash City.

411
00:29:21,387 --> 00:29:24,015
Lefty, didn't you once attend school?

412
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,718
- Well, l-- Yeah.
- Good.

413
00:29:26,793 --> 00:29:29,387
Now you're the new superintendent
for schools.

414
00:29:30,163 --> 00:29:33,394
Thanks, Whip.
This is a dream come true for me.

415
00:29:33,466 --> 00:29:36,094
Homer, didn't you once work
at McDonald's?

416
00:29:36,169 --> 00:29:39,104
Yeah, Whip,
but l'm your number two guy.

417
00:29:39,172 --> 00:29:40,833
l'm part of the brain trust.

418
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:42,602
Absolutely.

419
00:29:42,675 --> 00:29:46,611
Now you can manage
the Snidely Whiplash Slaw-Dogs stand.

420
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:49,671
Oh, man.
l'm getting screwed.

421
00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:52,115
And we're going to need doctors.

422
00:29:53,352 --> 00:29:56,014
Which one of you is dumb enough
to think you can perform brain surgery?

423
00:30:00,526 --> 00:30:03,120
Congratulations.
You're the town's new brain surgeon.

424
00:30:04,197 --> 00:30:06,791
- Yes!
- Yes, indeed.

425
00:30:06,866 --> 00:30:09,426
lt's pretty obvious we're going
to need a really good psychiatrist.

426
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:18,473
Honey? Look, honey!
l found it!

427
00:30:18,544 --> 00:30:21,308
Good-bye, Las Vegas.
Hello, Whiplash City.

428
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,314
- A place for parents to pan for gold...
- Get a picture! A picture!

429
00:30:23,382 --> 00:30:25,247
- and bond with their children.
- l don't want to.

430
00:30:25,318 --> 00:30:26,979
Carlie, get a picture!

431
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:30,819
And a place to prove
that white men can dance.

432
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,159
California, Georgia, Puerto Rico.

433
00:30:39,232 --> 00:30:40,824
But where are the Canadians?

434
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,994
Canadians like to think things over
before they do something.

435
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:47,005
- Americans just jump.
- And thank goodness they do.

436
00:30:47,073 --> 00:30:49,507
Did you like the way l pronounced
Puerto Rico?

437
00:30:49,575 --> 00:30:50,667
Yeah.

438
00:30:50,743 --> 00:30:52,506
l speak a little Spanish.

439
00:30:52,578 --> 00:30:54,671
You're the complete package, Whip.

440
00:30:54,747 --> 00:30:58,740
Yes, Snidely had taken over
Dudley Do-Right's town.

441
00:30:58,818 --> 00:31:02,777
But little did he know that Dudley
was hard at work devising a plan to--

442
00:31:02,855 --> 00:31:05,119
That Dudley was hard at work,
devi--

443
00:31:05,191 --> 00:31:08,786
Okay, l'm lying. He was fast asleep,
dreaming about Horse.

444
00:31:12,855 --> 00:31:14,413
Reunited

445
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,948
And it feels so good

446
00:31:18,527 --> 00:31:20,620
- Horse!
- Reunited

447
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:24,462
'Cause we understood

448
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:26,626
There's one perfect fit

449
00:31:26,702 --> 00:31:30,798
And sugar, this one is it

450
00:31:30,873 --> 00:31:33,307
We both are so excited

451
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:36,139
'Cause we're reunited

452
00:31:36,211 --> 00:31:40,944
Hey, hey

453
00:31:42,885 --> 00:31:45,820
lt's so good to see you again.
Nell's here, and you're here.

454
00:31:45,888 --> 00:31:49,221
And if only l knew what
that Snidely Whiplash was up to.

455
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:50,815
What?

456
00:31:50,893 --> 00:31:53,487
You mean there never were
any vampires?

457
00:31:53,562 --> 00:31:54,824
What else?

458
00:31:54,897 --> 00:31:56,364
That dirty rat!

459
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,601
Hey, yo, Whipster.
We're making a fortune! Come on.

460
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,107
So l see. So l see.

461
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:09,110
lt's the same with the gift shop.

462
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:10,770
And the gas station.

463
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,110
And the funeral home
should be showing a profit...

464
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:15,116
if l've got anything to do with it.

465
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,114
Mr. Whip?
l was thinking--

466
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:21,452
with us getting rich and all--
that maybe we should...

467
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:22,956
start playing golf.

468
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,318
My word. You're a genius.

469
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:37,969
The par 72 golf course was soon
Snidely's pride and joy.

470
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,477
And, thanks to the complimentary
golf balls he gave to all his guests...

471
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,102
he never lost a game.

472
00:32:46,115 --> 00:32:49,084
- Ever.
- Bad luck!

473
00:32:49,151 --> 00:32:50,584
You must have looked up.

474
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:03,591
Stop right there, Whiplash!

475
00:33:03,665 --> 00:33:06,133
Do-Right, you made me
hit the windmill!

476
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:09,602
- No one talks when l shoot!
- You the man, Whip.

477
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:13,300
There's something going on in Semi-Happy
Valley that l don't approve of.

478
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:17,106
lt's called Whiplash City now,
Mountie boy.

479
00:33:18,647 --> 00:33:20,114
You remember Nell Fenwick.

480
00:33:21,383 --> 00:33:23,317
Remember her? He'd been in love
with her since he was six.

481
00:33:23,385 --> 00:33:25,444
Hello, Snidely.

482
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:28,388
We've known each other too long
to be that formal.

483
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:32,955
Nell, will you stop that!

484
00:33:33,028 --> 00:33:34,461
Zowie!

485
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,293
- Cool hat.
- We try.

486
00:33:36,365 --> 00:33:38,959
What do you want, totem breath?

487
00:33:39,034 --> 00:33:41,468
- ''Totem breath''?
- lt's the best l could come up with.

488
00:33:41,537 --> 00:33:44,836
lt's hard to kiss and think
at the same time--

489
00:33:44,907 --> 00:33:47,933
neither of which activity
you've had much experience with.

490
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:55,813
What l want is for you to know that l
don't know for sure what you're up to...

491
00:33:55,884 --> 00:33:58,785
- but you're for sure up to something.
- Well put.

492
00:33:58,854 --> 00:34:01,414
And l intend to find out
what that something is.

493
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,857
Do-Right, you'd need a psychic
to find out what l'm up to.

494
00:34:04,927 --> 00:34:06,019
l don't think so.

495
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:12,592
- l think that's a gimme, eh, boys?
- Oh, yeah.

496
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:14,602
Let's play the next hole.
Come join us, Nell.

497
00:34:17,372 --> 00:34:19,306
lt's just Snidely, for Pete's sake.

498
00:34:19,374 --> 00:34:22,707
Though Snidely was the bad guy,
he did have a certain something.

499
00:34:22,778 --> 00:34:24,939
First you ran everyone out of town.

500
00:34:25,013 --> 00:34:26,947
- And then you took over the town.
- Yes. What else?

501
00:34:27,015 --> 00:34:29,108
And then you--
Gosh, l knew it this morning.

502
00:34:29,184 --> 00:34:31,778
- Oh, come on, Einstein. You can do it.
- Then you--

503
00:34:31,854 --> 00:34:35,017
Then you salted the streams
and mines with gold...

504
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,285
in order to create
a false gold rush!

505
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,623
And because you own the town
and everything in it...

506
00:34:39,695 --> 00:34:42,129
you stand to make a great fortune.

507
00:34:42,197 --> 00:34:44,631
Hop off, sweet cakes.
Carry on, boys.

508
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,964
Dudley, keep your voice down.
This is an exclusive club.

509
00:34:47,035 --> 00:34:48,798
- l don't care.
- Would you like to play with us?

510
00:34:48,871 --> 00:34:50,805
- l'll give you a stroke a hole.
- Not a chance!

511
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:52,306
Oh, come on.

512
00:34:52,374 --> 00:34:54,638
Hello. Yes, carry on.
Carry on.

513
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,474
Very good there.
Lovely to see you. Yes.

514
00:34:57,546 --> 00:34:59,480
Yeah. Lovely ball.
Thank you very much.

515
00:35:00,482 --> 00:35:03,417
Well, my dear friend and worthy foe,
once again...

516
00:35:03,485 --> 00:35:05,919
l've foolishly underestimated you.

517
00:35:05,988 --> 00:35:07,922
That's right.
And l'm right?

518
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,756
You're way off. But what if a rumor
like that spread around?

519
00:35:11,827 --> 00:35:14,261
lt could destroy a community
like Semi-Happy Valley--

520
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:16,263
or whatever you want to call it.

521
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:18,265
You wouldn't want that, would you?

522
00:35:20,502 --> 00:35:23,096
- We have to tell the truth, Snidely.
- Yes, of course.

523
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:27,267
But before we do anything rash, let's
sit down and discuss it like adults.

524
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:30,106
- When?
- Tonight. 9:00 p.m. sharp.

525
00:35:30,178 --> 00:35:31,941
- Where?
- Your place.

526
00:35:32,014 --> 00:35:33,948
- What's the dress?
- Casual.

527
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,284
That really doesn't leave me much time
to get ready.

528
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:39,286
You could microwave some
of those little hot dog thingies.

529
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:40,685
All right.

530
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:46,627
Snidely didn't keep his date
with Dudley, but Homer did.

531
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:50,131
And he was thoughtful enough
to bring along a six-pack...

532
00:35:50,198 --> 00:35:51,460
of dynamite.

533
00:36:26,001 --> 00:36:29,562
You look, somehow, l don't know--
younger.

534
00:36:29,638 --> 00:36:32,607
- How did it go?
- Everything's taken care of.

535
00:36:32,674 --> 00:36:36,576
Your boy is in do-gooder heaven.
l couldn't even find his body.

536
00:36:37,846 --> 00:36:42,749
Excellent! Get out of that garish
outfit and find yourself a black suit.

537
00:36:42,818 --> 00:36:44,945
You are our new funeral home director.

538
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,454
- Shane!
- Yes, Mr. Whiplash?

539
00:36:47,522 --> 00:36:49,114
- Drinks on the house.
- Yes, sir.

540
00:36:49,191 --> 00:36:51,284
- Wait a second. Drinks are 50% off.
- Right.

541
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,349
Wait a second.

542
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:55,453
- Double the price of everything.
- Yes, sir.

543
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:59,523
While Snidely celebrated Dudley's
demise, Dudley was actually in Ottawa...

544
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:03,230
telling the authorities
about Snidely's evil scheme.

545
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:06,900
What Dudley didn't know was that
Snidely had friends in high places...

546
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:08,840
- What are you looking at?
- as well as low.

547
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:12,607
Well, that is an amazing story
you tell, Officer Do-Right.

548
00:37:12,681 --> 00:37:15,514
Thank you. l also know a story
about a hermit who kept a--

549
00:37:15,584 --> 00:37:17,848
But let's say you're wrong.

550
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:20,410
Wouldn't a rumor like that
destroy the suddenly...

551
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:22,923
burgeoning economy of your little town?

552
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:26,085
That's what Snidely Whiplash said,
but he didn't use the word ''burgeoning.''

553
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:30,097
This Mr. Whiplash sounds like
a very community-minded fellow to me.

554
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,599
Oh, come on. Wake up.
He's the bad guy.

555
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,999
Just look at the way he dresses.

556
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,833
Ah, but is he really?

557
00:37:36,905 --> 00:37:39,931
Here we have millions
of American dollars...

558
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:43,569
pouring into an otherwise
impoverished section of Canada.

559
00:37:43,645 --> 00:37:47,809
Strike me several times with a blunt
instrument, but that's not good?

560
00:37:47,883 --> 00:37:50,818
But it's wrong,
and as you can tell from my name--

561
00:37:50,886 --> 00:37:52,945
But isn't it sometimes difficult
to discern...

562
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,921
the line between right and wrong?

563
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,457
- Uh--
- Not for him.

564
00:37:56,525 --> 00:38:00,825
He's a Mountie. For these guys,
things are either right or wrong.

565
00:38:00,896 --> 00:38:03,558
Boom, boom. Cut and dried.
Discern that, why don't you?

566
00:38:06,635 --> 00:38:08,899
Gold! l found gold!

567
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,403
He found gold!

568
00:38:12,808 --> 00:38:13,900
Right.

569
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:15,909
We'll build the hotel on this side...

570
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:18,070
and we'll put the condominiums
on that side...

571
00:38:18,146 --> 00:38:20,011
so people can walk
right out to the river.

572
00:38:20,082 --> 00:38:22,016
- l love it.
- Yes, l thought you might.

573
00:38:22,084 --> 00:38:24,712
- l bet everyone loves it.
- Well, who wouldn't?

574
00:38:24,786 --> 00:38:26,549
Well, l don't.

575
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:28,851
- lt does have some problems.
- lt's not perfect.

576
00:38:28,924 --> 00:38:30,892
Oh, but it is perfect.

577
00:38:31,993 --> 00:38:34,860
You know, boys,
you're the best gang l've ever had.

578
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,091
- Thanks, Whip.
- Thanks, Whip.

579
00:38:37,165 --> 00:38:38,427
Particularly you--

580
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,263
Homer.

581
00:38:40,335 --> 00:38:42,735
Oh, gosh, l--

582
00:38:42,804 --> 00:38:44,533
Morning, boys.

583
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:51,945
''Do-gooder heaven,'' eh?
Back to the Slaw-Dogs stand with you.

584
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:54,106
l know, l know.

585
00:39:00,622 --> 00:39:02,556
Hello?

586
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:05,759
Have you seen my office lately?

587
00:39:05,827 --> 00:39:06,885
Well, not lately.

588
00:39:06,962 --> 00:39:11,729
- Why? Have you done something with it?
- No, but someone has.

589
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,734
Dudley, Father's come back.

590
00:39:13,802 --> 00:39:16,896
- l'm afraid he's got some bad news.
- Where are you?

591
00:39:16,972 --> 00:39:19,907
You know how bad l am
with directions.

592
00:39:19,975 --> 00:39:21,909
Are you in a car?

593
00:39:21,977 --> 00:39:24,571
Yes, but it stopped.

594
00:39:28,984 --> 00:39:32,420
l think l'm gonna have to call you back.
We've got a bad connection.

595
00:39:35,657 --> 00:39:37,522
lnspector!

596
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:39,082
At ease, Do-Right.

597
00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:43,354
lt does this old heart of mine
good to see you again, sir.

598
00:39:43,431 --> 00:39:46,594
You're my hero, sir.
You're my role model.

599
00:39:46,668 --> 00:39:51,799
Dudley, you're finished as a Mountie.
Get your horse and clear out of here.

600
00:39:51,873 --> 00:39:53,272
Horse ran away.

601
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:57,300
Oh, dear.
l'm so sorry to hear that.

602
00:39:57,379 --> 00:39:59,506
Oh, l can't watch.
l just can't watch.

603
00:39:59,581 --> 00:40:02,607
Your father's joshing me about being
drummed out of the service.

604
00:40:02,684 --> 00:40:05,152
- lt's very funny.
- l'm not joshing you...

605
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,778
even the tiniest bit.

606
00:40:06,855 --> 00:40:09,119
The highest level
of the Canadian government...

607
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:11,955
has called me out of retirement
to replace you here.

608
00:40:13,695 --> 00:40:15,128
l know what this is about.

609
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:17,131
l was supposed to have a meeting
with Snidely Whiplash...

610
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:19,133
but l completely forgot about it.

611
00:40:19,201 --> 00:40:21,965
- Then l went to Ottawa instead.
- And then Ottawa called on me.

612
00:40:22,037 --> 00:40:26,064
Now give me your uniform
and your sidearm and leave.

613
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:29,304
- My uniform, sir?
- l'm sorry, Dudley.

614
00:40:29,377 --> 00:40:32,210
This is a very sad moment.

615
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,805
Yes, lnspector, it certainly is.

616
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:18,625
He had lost his uniform.

617
00:41:18,693 --> 00:41:21,287
He had lost his horse.

618
00:41:21,363 --> 00:41:23,888
Dudley's dreams were shattered.

619
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:27,799
Hello. Remember me?
l was on Regis and Kathie Lee.

620
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:31,305
Yeah, l was. Honestly. Last week.
Only last week. lt was very good.

621
00:41:31,373 --> 00:41:34,137
l was on Regis and Kathie Lee.

622
00:41:34,209 --> 00:41:37,144
Hello. l know Bette Midler personally.

623
00:41:37,212 --> 00:41:41,649
Hi! lt's me!
l was on Regis and Kathie Lee last week.

624
00:41:41,716 --> 00:41:44,651
Hey! l know you.

625
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:47,813
You are Dudley Do-Right
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

626
00:41:47,889 --> 00:41:49,982
l never forget a face--

627
00:41:50,058 --> 00:41:52,618
although a name
sometimes escapes me.

628
00:41:52,694 --> 00:41:57,825
Sir, l lost my job today.
My horse ran away.

629
00:41:57,899 --> 00:42:01,596
And l'd really like to be alone
right now, if you don't mind.

630
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,831
Oh-- No chance, pal.

631
00:42:03,905 --> 00:42:06,430
- l am your new best friend.
- l don't have any friends.

632
00:42:06,508 --> 00:42:09,477
- Hey, you got me, pal.
- l don't even have a home.

633
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,944
Wait till you see my place!

634
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:18,110
Meanwhile, Whiplash had begun
his evil campaign...

635
00:42:18,186 --> 00:42:22,452
to win the affections of the fair
Nell Fenwick and to impress her father.

636
00:42:22,524 --> 00:42:26,290
Let us hope they can see right through
this scheming cad.

637
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:27,453
Sorry.

638
00:42:27,529 --> 00:42:29,622
May l recommend
the salt cod bouillabaisse...

639
00:42:29,698 --> 00:42:33,634
followed by the buckwheat crepes
with tangerine reduction?

640
00:42:34,703 --> 00:42:37,968
- Okay. Father?
- Sounds delectable.

641
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:40,303
But for me, hold the fennel seed.

642
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:42,468
Very wise choice, lnspector,
very wise.

643
00:42:42,544 --> 00:42:43,875
Thank you.

644
00:42:54,389 --> 00:42:57,984
- You drank too much last night.
- Did l?

645
00:42:58,059 --> 00:42:59,356
l feel pretty good.

646
00:42:59,427 --> 00:43:02,590
You know, the line
between right and wrong...

647
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:05,224
is oftentimes
difficult to discern.

648
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,768
Yeah. l was--
l was just thinking that myself.

649
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:11,272
Snidely Whiplash has brought prosperity
to Semi-Happy Valley.

650
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,432
He's turned this nowhere town around.

651
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,237
Of course, he ran off
all the old residents.

652
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,369
Oh, it's all about greed.

653
00:43:17,445 --> 00:43:19,709
You're right! That's it!

654
00:43:19,781 --> 00:43:21,874
lt is greed!
That's all it is!

655
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,178
lt's just greed!

656
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:27,116
Please don't make any sudden moves
around me this morning, all right?

657
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,316
Here's what l don't understand.
What happens when the gold runs out?

658
00:43:30,392 --> 00:43:32,860
Oh, it's never gonna run out.

659
00:43:32,927 --> 00:43:36,385
- lt's not?
- Whiplash is too smart.

660
00:43:36,464 --> 00:43:39,922
Snidely was smart enough
to keep the gold coming in...

661
00:43:40,001 --> 00:43:42,128
so the profits would keep coming in.

662
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,797
Smart enough to own his own helicopter.

663
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:47,467
Smart enough to have won over
every government authority...

664
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:51,911
within 2,000 miles,
but was he smart enough to outwit...

665
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,107
a pathetic bum
and the only man to be...

666
00:43:54,182 --> 00:43:55,706
thrown out of the Mounties
in 100 years?

667
00:43:55,784 --> 00:43:58,719
We'll have to see about that.

668
00:43:58,787 --> 00:44:00,220
l don't see anything.

669
00:44:04,259 --> 00:44:08,355
See? That's where they melt down
the gold so they can salt it at night.

670
00:44:20,108 --> 00:44:23,600
Would you look how popular Snidely is?
That's not right.

671
00:44:23,678 --> 00:44:25,612
People always suck up
to the guy in charge.

672
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,773
You know that.
lt's like life.

673
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:29,942
l say we go down there
and arrest them all.

674
00:44:30,018 --> 00:44:31,610
- Oh, l don't think so.
- Why not?

675
00:44:31,686 --> 00:44:33,278
l'll give you three good reasons.

676
00:44:33,354 --> 00:44:35,788
l'd like to start with the second one
first, if that's okay with you.

677
00:44:35,857 --> 00:44:38,792
Okay, two.

678
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,953
lf we go down there,
they'll kill us.

679
00:44:41,029 --> 00:44:43,122
One. You're not a Mountie anymore.

680
00:44:43,198 --> 00:44:46,133
And three, they're not doing
anything illegal.

681
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:48,465
But we've got to do something!

682
00:44:48,536 --> 00:44:50,470
You've got to do something.

683
00:44:50,538 --> 00:44:53,336
l just wanted to show you
what was going on.

684
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:56,643
What's my next move?

685
00:44:57,712 --> 00:45:01,580
Well, you could steal the gold
before they can salt it...

686
00:45:01,649 --> 00:45:03,640
and that way, end of gold rush.

687
00:45:03,718 --> 00:45:05,276
What? Me steal?

688
00:45:05,353 --> 00:45:06,786
Me break the law?

689
00:45:06,855 --> 00:45:09,323
- Sadly, yeah.
- But then l'd be Dudley Do-Wrong.

690
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:12,257
Do-Wrong's nice. l like that.
lt's kind of French.

691
00:45:12,327 --> 00:45:14,761
You know-- ''Dudley Durange.''

692
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:17,297
l'm so confused.

693
00:45:17,365 --> 00:45:19,492
lt's not that complicated, Dudley.

694
00:45:19,567 --> 00:45:23,936
The bad guy, Snidely Whiplash,
is apparently doing good...

695
00:45:24,005 --> 00:45:25,939
ergo, putting you, the good guy...

696
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:28,100
in the position
of having to be the bad guy.

697
00:45:28,176 --> 00:45:31,111
Well, not exactly the bad guy.
Let's say the ''badder'' guy.

698
00:45:31,179 --> 00:45:34,046
But let me remind you
that as a bad guy doing good...

699
00:45:34,115 --> 00:45:36,049
does not necessarily make him
a good guy...

700
00:45:36,117 --> 00:45:41,987
so a good guy doing bad does not,
ipso facto, make him a bad guy.

701
00:45:42,056 --> 00:45:44,889
This can't be happening.
He can't be the good guy.

702
00:45:44,959 --> 00:45:46,119
But he is.

703
00:45:46,194 --> 00:45:47,786
The good citizens of Whiplash City
are throwing...

704
00:45:47,862 --> 00:45:49,887
a gala ball in his honor tonight.

705
00:45:50,865 --> 00:45:51,957
For Snidely?

706
00:46:08,216 --> 00:46:11,242
l don't believe it!
They love him!

707
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:14,755
- Better believe it.
- He is the good guy.

708
00:46:14,822 --> 00:46:16,915
Yeah, not to mention the fact
he's got Nell.

709
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:20,525
Maybe it's just someone
who looks like her.

710
00:46:24,332 --> 00:46:25,697
Nah. That's Nell.

711
00:46:30,772 --> 00:46:33,570
lt is Nell!

712
00:46:33,641 --> 00:46:37,099
l can't believe
that this is happening to me!

713
00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:40,941
- Sorry.
- lt's okay.

714
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:43,108
l better go do something about this.

715
00:46:43,184 --> 00:46:46,745
No, wait. You're not ready.
You're not trained.

716
00:48:36,464 --> 00:48:37,396
Well done.

717
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:43,769
This is gonna take a lot of work.

718
00:48:43,902 --> 00:48:46,234
And who better to do that work
than Kim Darling himself...

719
00:48:46,304 --> 00:48:49,239
a grown man with an extensive
Pokmon collection.

720
00:48:49,307 --> 00:48:50,797
My son...

721
00:48:50,876 --> 00:48:53,401
the hero defeats danger...

722
00:48:53,478 --> 00:48:56,379
because he is dangerous himself.

723
00:48:56,448 --> 00:48:59,349
You are dangerous.

724
00:48:59,418 --> 00:49:01,682
Know it. Say it.

725
00:49:01,753 --> 00:49:04,119
You are dangerous.

726
00:49:06,591 --> 00:49:09,526
Say, ''l am dangerous.''

727
00:49:09,594 --> 00:49:13,291
- l did.
- No. Say, ''l am dangerous.''

728
00:49:13,365 --> 00:49:14,855
You are dangerous.

729
00:49:14,933 --> 00:49:17,527
You say, ''l am dangerous.''

730
00:49:17,602 --> 00:49:20,469
- But you said--
- Oh, never mind.

731
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:23,474
The hero must face three trials.

732
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:25,407
Trust, daring...

733
00:49:25,477 --> 00:49:26,739
instinct.

734
00:49:26,812 --> 00:49:30,373
For the sake of consistency,
we'll start with number two.

735
00:49:30,449 --> 00:49:31,882
Daring!

736
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,718
Okay now, l am your adversary.

737
00:49:37,789 --> 00:49:39,723
l am evil.

738
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:43,022
Evil! Evil!

739
00:49:43,095 --> 00:49:44,722
You're evil?

740
00:49:44,796 --> 00:49:48,596
Yes. And now l'm going to draw
this line in the sand.

741
00:49:50,135 --> 00:49:53,104
Now, do not dare cross that line...

742
00:49:53,171 --> 00:49:56,402
otherwise evil will rain down
upon you.

743
00:49:56,475 --> 00:49:57,942
Evil!

744
00:50:00,479 --> 00:50:01,605
Now look, Dudley, you--

745
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,705
You're supposed to take me up
on my challenge...

746
00:50:03,782 --> 00:50:05,272
by showing me how daring you are.

747
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:07,409
Let's try it once again,
shall we?

748
00:50:07,486 --> 00:50:09,579
l am evil!

749
00:50:09,654 --> 00:50:12,452
Now do not dare cross that line!

750
00:50:12,524 --> 00:50:14,583
l am evil!

751
00:50:14,659 --> 00:50:16,183
Evil!

752
00:50:18,497 --> 00:50:20,692
Well, what? You said
l'm not supposed to cross the line!

753
00:50:20,766 --> 00:50:22,791
But you're supposed to cross the line.

754
00:50:22,868 --> 00:50:24,130
Now, let's try it again.

755
00:50:24,202 --> 00:50:26,602
Okay, now, do not dare...

756
00:50:26,671 --> 00:50:28,969
cross the line of death.

757
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,374
l am evil! l am evil!

758
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,945
- What did you do that for?
- 'Cause l'm evil.

759
00:50:39,017 --> 00:50:41,713
l can't help it.
Sorry.

760
00:50:41,787 --> 00:50:44,620
...eight, nine, ten.

761
00:50:44,689 --> 00:50:45,951
Trust.

762
00:50:46,024 --> 00:50:47,787
The hero trusts.

763
00:50:47,859 --> 00:50:49,793
Now, l will throw some stones
at you--

764
00:50:49,861 --> 00:50:51,886
missing intentionally, of course--

765
00:50:51,963 --> 00:50:54,796
and you will not flinch
as they whiz...

766
00:50:54,866 --> 00:50:57,300
past your head,
because you trust me.

767
00:50:57,369 --> 00:50:58,996
- l trust you, master.
- Good!

768
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,731
Sorry-- but that was very good.
You trusted me.

769
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:06,243
Okay?

770
00:51:09,147 --> 00:51:10,910
Perfect! You didn't flinch at all.

771
00:51:12,217 --> 00:51:13,980
Just one more, okay?

772
00:51:19,591 --> 00:51:21,582
Excellent, absolutely!

773
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,594
Trust is your middle name.

774
00:51:26,498 --> 00:51:28,523
A little less moaning would be good.

775
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,660
The final test-- instinct.

776
00:51:31,736 --> 00:51:34,762
You will fight me
without benefit of eyesight.

777
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,933
You will block my every blow...

778
00:51:37,008 --> 00:51:39,772
because you can see
without your eyes.

779
00:51:39,845 --> 00:51:41,779
You can hear without your ears.

780
00:51:41,847 --> 00:51:44,281
- You can speak without your tongue.
- Yes, master.

781
00:51:44,349 --> 00:51:46,783
l said ''without your tongue.''

782
00:51:46,852 --> 00:51:49,787
Now, your sword is your stick.

783
00:51:49,855 --> 00:51:52,119
The stick is your defense.

784
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:54,454
Prepare to defeat me.

785
00:51:54,526 --> 00:51:56,289
Are you ready?

786
00:51:58,029 --> 00:52:00,896
Very good, indeed!
The hopping-foot defense.

787
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,892
Very good!
The other-foot-hopping defense.

788
00:52:03,969 --> 00:52:06,563
Wonderful!
You're at one with the universe!

789
00:52:06,638 --> 00:52:09,232
And now, concentrate.

790
00:52:09,307 --> 00:52:12,367
Prepare to receive my final assault.

791
00:52:14,813 --> 00:52:16,644
Wonderful.
The playing-dead defense.

792
00:52:16,715 --> 00:52:19,741
- Master?
- Good choice, under the circumstances.

793
00:52:19,818 --> 00:52:21,397
You'll be all right, my son--

794
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:23,521
provided they don't attack you
with sticks.

795
00:52:29,137 --> 00:52:31,469
With his master's lesson
ringing in his ears...

796
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,735
Dudley set off
in search of justice.

797
00:52:33,809 --> 00:52:36,209
- You are ready, my son.
- And Extra-Strength Tylenol.

798
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,371
You are ready because you've taken
everything l can throw at you...

799
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:41,109
and still you stand
tall and true.

800
00:52:41,183 --> 00:52:45,176
You are ready to face danger
because you are danger.

801
00:52:45,253 --> 00:52:49,121
Now, get out there
and do something dangerous.

802
00:52:54,863 --> 00:52:56,660
No! Please don't!

803
00:52:56,731 --> 00:53:00,167
Then tell me when
the next gold delivery arrives.

804
00:53:00,235 --> 00:53:01,668
l don't know.

805
00:53:01,736 --> 00:53:05,672
Well, then l'm afraid we're gonna
find out which is your better side.

806
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:09,107
- You're a Mountie.
- Not anymore.

807
00:53:09,177 --> 00:53:11,577
Thursday. The gold's coming
at noon on Thursday.

808
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:13,443
Noon Thursday. Thank you.

809
00:53:13,515 --> 00:53:16,678
- Now, if l just knew how to stop this--
- What?

810
00:53:16,751 --> 00:53:19,549
Whoa! That's not it.

811
00:53:30,198 --> 00:53:34,794
Just papier-mache.
Completely recyclable material.

812
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:39,967
- What kind of man are you anyway?
- A dangerous one.

813
00:54:08,737 --> 00:54:11,934
- He's got the gold!
- After him, boys!

814
00:54:27,188 --> 00:54:29,315
He may have been outnumbered...

815
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:33,191
but Dudley knew these woods
like the back of his horse.

816
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:04,785
Do you have any idea what
this could possibly mean?

817
00:56:04,853 --> 00:56:06,753
Doris Day.

818
00:56:09,024 --> 00:56:11,288
- Just a guess.
- Dom Deluise.

819
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:14,192
- Daniel Day-Lewis.
- Snoop Doggy Dogg.

820
00:56:14,262 --> 00:56:16,093
- Daphne du Maurier.
- Oh, shut up.

821
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,291
- Doc Duvalier.
- David Duchovny?

822
00:56:18,366 --> 00:56:20,300
- Delores Del Rio.
- Shut up, you idiots.

823
00:56:20,368 --> 00:56:22,427
Dan Rather.

824
00:56:23,872 --> 00:56:25,965
These initials could
only mean one thing--

825
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,900
Dudley Do-Right.

826
00:56:28,977 --> 00:56:30,968
You think Do-Right has got
the guts for something like this?

827
00:56:31,046 --> 00:56:34,072
- Of course l do.
- Wow.

828
00:56:34,149 --> 00:56:38,848
You realize what this means, don't you?
He's becoming the bad guy.

829
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,321
Where does that leave me?
l used to be the bad guy.

830
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:44,620
lf he's capable of doing this...

831
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:49,187
who knows what other really fun,
bad-guy stuff he's been doing.

832
00:56:50,432 --> 00:56:53,299
- What other stuff indeed.
- David Duchovny.

833
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:57,464
For Snidely was about to discover
a crime so low, so hideous...

834
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,973
it had to involve toilet paper.

835
00:57:04,312 --> 00:57:05,745
Oh, man.

836
00:57:07,482 --> 00:57:11,646
What a bleak and rimy day.

837
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:15,417
Something like this just
makes you sick to your stomach.

838
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,788
Don't touch me!

839
00:57:21,696 --> 00:57:26,395
- Where are you going?
- My work is done here now.

840
00:57:26,468 --> 00:57:29,631
So it's time for me
to rejoin my family.

841
00:57:29,704 --> 00:57:31,729
You have a family?

842
00:57:31,806 --> 00:57:34,502
Yeah, well, it's a long story.

843
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:37,773
But basically,
l was lost like you.

844
00:57:37,846 --> 00:57:40,371
l wasn't a hero to anyone,
not even myself.

845
00:57:40,448 --> 00:57:42,939
No one ever really
believed in me.

846
00:57:43,017 --> 00:57:45,144
But l feel you're my friend now,
and you believe in me.

847
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:49,156
And that gives me the strength
to rejoin my loved ones...

848
00:57:50,225 --> 00:57:52,352
if l can find them.

849
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:55,954
l'm a new man, Dudley,
thanks to you.

850
00:57:56,030 --> 00:58:00,262
- What about the chain saw?
- Parting gift.

851
00:58:00,335 --> 00:58:03,099
Family tradition. Don't ask.

852
00:58:03,171 --> 00:58:06,072
- Thank you.
- Use it in peace, not war.

853
00:58:07,008 --> 00:58:09,101
You can count on me.

854
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:12,910
My son.

855
00:58:18,419 --> 00:58:19,852
My master.

856
00:58:31,065 --> 00:58:33,090
Oh, that's lovely, Whip.

857
00:58:33,168 --> 00:58:36,103
The play of light,
the chiaroscuro shading--

858
00:58:36,171 --> 00:58:39,106
- Shut up, Homer.
- You got it, Whip.

859
00:58:42,677 --> 00:58:44,736
What was that?

860
00:59:10,071 --> 00:59:14,030
Well, Snidely. Posing as an artist
to gain young Nell's favor, eh?

861
00:59:14,108 --> 00:59:17,271
Stop the music!

862
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:20,246
He's quite talented, Dudley.

863
00:59:20,315 --> 00:59:23,307
lt's paint-by-numbers.

864
00:59:23,384 --> 00:59:26,080
l can't tell you how hard it is to keep
the paint inside those teeny lines.

865
00:59:26,154 --> 00:59:29,681
Wait a minute. You're wearing black.
That's my color.

866
00:59:29,757 --> 00:59:33,249
- l'm the bad guy.
- But you're not wearing black, Snidely.

867
00:59:33,328 --> 00:59:35,592
- That's dark blue.
- lt is not.

868
00:59:35,663 --> 00:59:39,565
lt is so. lt's navy.
See for yourself.

869
00:59:42,937 --> 00:59:46,304
- What am l doing wearing blue?
- Well, the black one's at the cleaners.

870
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:50,606
And l just wanna say, you look
good in blue. You really do.

871
00:59:50,678 --> 00:59:53,146
Oh! ''l just wanna say.''
''l just wanna say.''

872
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:59,812
Nell, you'll always think of me
as wearing black, won't you?

873
01:00:03,591 --> 01:00:06,424
Oh, l don't know, Snidely.

874
01:00:06,494 --> 01:00:08,860
l don't think this portrait really
captures Nell's preternatural beauty.

875
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:12,661
Oh, yes. Like you could
do better, Mountie boy?

876
01:00:17,805 --> 01:00:21,673
- ls that a challenge?
- Absolutely.

877
01:01:17,332 --> 01:01:18,993
lt's lovely.

878
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,999
Shall we, Nell?

879
01:01:43,424 --> 01:01:46,291
You look really good
in green, Whip.

880
01:01:53,618 --> 01:01:55,984
He's a cunning adversary,
Homer...

881
01:01:56,054 --> 01:02:00,457
but not cunning enough
to outwit Snidely K. Whiplash.

882
01:02:01,526 --> 01:02:04,427
You are my role model, Whip.

883
01:02:04,496 --> 01:02:07,829
So Dudley wants to be the bad guy.

884
01:02:07,899 --> 01:02:10,163
We'll see if the shoe fits.

885
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,998
- What shoe, Whip?
- Oh, for Pete's sake.

886
01:02:19,911 --> 01:02:22,709
We've all done our best
to make Whiplash City...

887
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:25,443
a place of peace and prosperity...

888
01:02:25,517 --> 01:02:30,011
where we could all make lots of money
without doing anything at all.

889
01:02:30,088 --> 01:02:35,890
That's how life should be. But there's
a man trying to ruin all that.

890
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,656
- This is the man.
- Hey, that's Dudley!

891
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:41,756
- He's the good guy!
- This man is dangerous and evil.

892
01:02:41,833 --> 01:02:44,802
He's not evil!
You're wrong, Whiplash!

893
01:02:44,869 --> 01:02:47,963
We must find him at once.

894
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:51,600
Gold miners
of Whiplash City unite.

895
01:02:51,676 --> 01:02:55,237
Dudley Do-Right must be
found and done away with.

896
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,941
- No!
- He must be killed, you hear me?

897
01:03:02,387 --> 01:03:03,820
Killed!

898
01:03:05,223 --> 01:03:07,885
Yes, the tide
had turn against Snidely.

899
01:03:07,959 --> 01:03:11,019
The townspeople had grown tired
of Whiplash City.

900
01:03:11,095 --> 01:03:13,791
They wanted their town back
just the way it used to be.

901
01:03:13,865 --> 01:03:16,834
So while Snidely was growing
weaker by the minute...

902
01:03:16,901 --> 01:03:19,495
Dudley was growing stronger.

903
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:24,403
Yo, Mr. Do-Right.
Five minutes.

904
01:03:26,244 --> 01:03:27,575
Thank you.

905
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:52,354
Bravo!

906
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:55,263
Though Nell had witnessed many examples
of our hero's derring-do...

907
01:04:55,333 --> 01:05:00,965
it took a dance number to convince her
that Dudley was studly.

908
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:10,413
When l'm calling you

909
01:05:10,481 --> 01:05:14,008
When l'm calling you

910
01:05:16,087 --> 01:05:21,889
Will you answer too

911
01:05:25,663 --> 01:05:28,962
- l love you now, and l always have.
- You really do, Nell?

912
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:39,608
Meanwhile, back at Snidely's
secret hideout and day spa--

913
01:05:39,677 --> 01:05:43,408
We have to find out where
that sniveling Do-Right is hiding.

914
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:46,348
l've got the men out combing
the countryside, Whip.

915
01:05:46,417 --> 01:05:47,850
Do you?

916
01:05:51,122 --> 01:05:52,555
l'll get it.

917
01:05:54,459 --> 01:05:56,222
Here.

918
01:05:56,294 --> 01:05:58,728
Yeah, give it to me.
Hello.

919
01:05:58,796 --> 01:06:00,627
What?

920
01:06:00,698 --> 01:06:02,632
We found him.

921
01:06:05,069 --> 01:06:10,507
This calls for a celebration.
Waiter! Two mudslingers, please.

922
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:17,238
Snidely and his henchmen immediately
launched an all-out assault...

923
01:06:17,315 --> 01:06:18,907
on the Kumquat nation.

924
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,748
lt's Whiplash.

925
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,458
They just want me, Chief.
l'll go quietly.

926
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:34,692
- This isn't your fight.
- l'm backing you 110%.

927
01:06:34,766 --> 01:06:37,963
And l mean that, so far.

928
01:06:39,437 --> 01:06:41,997
- You got weapons?
- Weapons?

929
01:06:42,073 --> 01:06:44,371
Come on. This is basically
a dinner theater we're running here.

930
01:06:46,844 --> 01:06:48,778
- You got fireworks?
- That we got.

931
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:58,045
Fire!

932
01:07:05,129 --> 01:07:09,793
They're just fireworks, you sissies!
Be men!

933
01:07:31,622 --> 01:07:34,147
That's the last of the fireworks.
Now what ?

934
01:07:34,225 --> 01:07:37,194
We'll take to the forest
and throw rocks at them.

935
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:39,195
- Rocks?
- What else can we do?

936
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:08,456
- The press here?
- They're up there on the perimeter.

937
01:08:08,526 --> 01:08:09,788
Let's do it.

938
01:08:26,277 --> 01:08:28,507
General Whiplash,
the village is ours.

939
01:08:28,579 --> 01:08:30,877
- Torch it, Shane. Burn everything.
- Yes, sir.

940
01:08:30,948 --> 01:08:34,042
No. Wait a minute.
That's bad publicity.

941
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:38,919
Have the photographers take pictures
of the boys straightening up the place.

942
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:42,653
- You got it.
- Learn from history or repeat it.

943
01:08:43,561 --> 01:08:44,994
Come on, Chief.

944
01:08:45,062 --> 01:08:47,292
l gotta stop.

945
01:08:47,365 --> 01:08:49,299
You can make it.
You're a young man.

946
01:08:49,367 --> 01:08:52,803
Don't let this face-lift fool you.
l'm 62.

947
01:08:54,305 --> 01:08:56,239
On second thought--

948
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:08,017
- Okay, hold it. Hold it right there.
- Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

949
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:13,714
- Somebody hit me with a rock.
- lt was one of them lndian dancers.

950
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:16,988
All right. That's it.
Now l'm heated.

951
01:09:17,762 --> 01:09:20,026
Not since their all-male revival
of Little Women...

952
01:09:20,097 --> 01:09:23,362
had the Kumquats faced
such a hostile reception.

953
01:09:23,434 --> 01:09:26,631
But the Kumquats never walked away
from a fight. They preferred to run.

954
01:09:30,508 --> 01:09:33,602
- Know what we need, Chief?
- Two weeks in Maui.

955
01:09:33,678 --> 01:09:35,873
No. Bigger rocks.

956
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:11,606
That's not fair!
They've got rocks!

957
01:10:11,682 --> 01:10:13,843
All we've got are
these machine guns.

958
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:17,251
Oh, mother of pearl,
here comes another one.

959
01:10:17,321 --> 01:10:20,449
- Let 'em have another one.
- The next size down is this one.

960
01:10:20,524 --> 01:10:22,856
- We're outta the big stuff.
- We're screwed.

961
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:26,055
No, we're not. Look.
lt's my horse, Horse.

962
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:28,189
Just like in my dream.

963
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:32,430
Wait a minute. We're saved because
that flea-bitten nag showed up?

964
01:10:32,503 --> 01:10:34,403
He's trying to tell us
to follow him.

965
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:38,165
l think he's just got
a fly up his nose.

966
01:10:41,512 --> 01:10:42,945
Come on, everybody!

967
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:51,888
We've got them
on the run now.

968
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:54,186
They'll never make it
across the valley floor.

969
01:10:55,259 --> 01:10:57,853
- Time to bring up the heavy equipment.
- Yes, sir!

970
01:11:03,367 --> 01:11:05,733
- Move out!
- Move, move, move, move!

971
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:08,504
l'm sorry.
l gotta stop.

972
01:11:08,572 --> 01:11:12,064
- Come on, Chief.
- No. That's it. l'm finished.

973
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:14,270
l thought native North Americans
could run all day.

974
01:11:14,345 --> 01:11:17,246
- Oh, yeah, like we're really lndians.
- We're not leaving without you.

975
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:22,218
- You guys go without me. Go!
- l'm gonna stand by you.

976
01:11:22,286 --> 01:11:25,744
Ah, Dudley.
l'm making you an honorary Kumquat.

977
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:28,917
- That means a great deal to me, Chief.
- Forget about it.

978
01:11:31,295 --> 01:11:34,924
He's a dead honorary Kumquat.

979
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:36,330
Roger.

980
01:11:37,401 --> 01:11:39,869
Tango Delta Foxtrot.

981
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,899
Shall we dance?

982
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:48,508
You gotta admit.
He comes prepared.

983
01:11:56,654 --> 01:11:58,918
- l think it's time to surrender.
- Yeah, it looks like it.

984
01:12:02,994 --> 01:12:05,792
- He's got another bug up his nose.
- No.

985
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:08,423
He's telling me he wants me
to attack the tanks.

986
01:12:08,499 --> 01:12:11,696
ls that good?
Taking advice from a horse?

987
01:12:11,769 --> 01:12:15,967
- Yes, it is.
- They got a brain the size of a pea.

988
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,974
- That's nuts.
- Not to mention stupid.

989
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:20,977
- l think it's wonderful.
- Don't worry. l'll save you, Nell.

990
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:28,147
Homer, let him have it.

991
01:12:46,504 --> 01:12:48,529
Come to Daddy.

992
01:12:54,111 --> 01:12:57,046
Ah, that's it.
End of game.

993
01:13:23,707 --> 01:13:25,368
Curses!
Where did they come from?

994
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:29,675
Come on!
Come back here, you cowards!

995
01:13:31,182 --> 01:13:33,377
General!

996
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:14,824
Good horse, Horse.

997
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:26,300
You know, Homer, this is the part
of the job l hate the most, the ending.

998
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:30,636
Up until then, being the bad guy
is the best job in the world.

999
01:14:33,644 --> 01:14:35,236
Hello, Dudley.

1000
01:14:35,312 --> 01:14:36,973
Hello, Whip.

1001
01:14:37,882 --> 01:14:41,318
l've lost everything.
Even the announcer's gone.

1002
01:14:41,385 --> 01:14:45,947
No, l'm still here. Someone's got
to explain where the cavalry came from.

1003
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:50,983
Yes. l was a mite curious
about that myself.

1004
01:14:57,835 --> 01:15:01,066
Yes, the prospector
had found his long-lost family.

1005
01:15:01,138 --> 01:15:04,539
The search was greatly simplified when
Kim spotted his wife on television...

1006
01:15:04,608 --> 01:15:07,577
as she was being sworn in
as prime minister of Canada.

1007
01:15:07,645 --> 01:15:10,375
lt was she
who called out the cavalry.

1008
01:15:10,447 --> 01:15:12,745
- That was lucky, wasn't it?
- Boy, l'll say.

1009
01:15:12,816 --> 01:15:16,149
And that's because
good things happen to good people.

1010
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:19,519
And bad things happen
to bad people.

1011
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:22,923
What's the problem, Officer?
l was only doing 25 miles an hour.

1012
01:15:22,993 --> 01:15:27,862
Well, that's the last we'll see
of them for a long, long time.

1013
01:15:27,932 --> 01:15:30,127
Don't count on it,
bugle boy.

1014
01:15:30,201 --> 01:15:33,193
No jail can hold
Snidely K. Whiplash.

1015
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:37,070
- Oh, shut up, Homer.
- Sure thing, Whip.

1016
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:41,707
Do-Right, would you
allow me the honor...

1017
01:15:41,779 --> 01:15:46,307
of presenting you
with your old uniform...

1018
01:15:46,383 --> 01:15:48,817
and the thanks
of a grateful nation?

1019
01:15:48,886 --> 01:15:51,377
Thank you, lnspector.

1020
01:15:51,455 --> 01:15:54,788
Hip hip hooray!
Hip hip hooray!

1021
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:02,331
Yes, Dudley now has everything
a Mountie could ever want.

1022
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:07,701
His fort, his girl and a swell
collection of foofey pillows.
