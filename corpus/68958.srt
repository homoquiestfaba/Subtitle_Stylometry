Duke of Northampton. Accident during
a motoring holiday. Fatal, sadly.

12
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:24,687
2,000 words by five o'clock, Mr Malone.

13
00:02:25,927 --> 00:02:27,519
Oh...!

14
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:32,396
Mr McArdle? The decapitation in Hackney.
I know the area well.

15
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:35,286
- Could I cover it?
- Arkwright's on it.

16
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:41,363
What about the Whitechapel opium dens?
I thought maybe I could go under cover.

17
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:46,840
- Maybe write about the white slave trade.
- You read too much trash.

18
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:51,444
I've been on obituaries
for over a year. Give me a chance!

19
00:02:52,727 --> 00:02:56,436
- What do you know about dinosaurs?
- Not much.

20
00:02:56,607 --> 00:03:00,441
I'm attending a lecture tonight
at the Natural History Museum.

21
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:04,964
- You can come and write it up.
- Gladys told me of this.

22
00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:10,121
She's my girl. Her father arranged the
evening. He's high up in the Royal Society.

23
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:13,245
If I like it, I might put you on the next murder.

24
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:18,524
- Thank you very much.
- I still need 2,000 words on the Duke!

25
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:37,647
Sorry I'm late. The Duke had a full life.

26
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:42,278
- Edward, you do talk in riddles.
- Good evening, Professor Illingworth.

27
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:46,076
We'd better go in. I detest
missing the beginning of a lecture.

28
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:53,921
(ILLINGWORTH) You might learn
something. Summerlee's a good man.

29
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:57,921
Not an original mind, of course,
but solid, very solid.

30
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,601
Edward. You mustn't!

31
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:08,125
You shouldn't be so pretty. Have you
thought any more about our conversation?

32
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:12,485
- Which one? There are so many.
- You know which one.

33
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:18,077
- Gladys, I DO have prospects.
- Look, it's Lord Roxton!

34
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:22,604
He's just come back from Africa.
Hunting elephants and tigers.

35
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:27,841
- Actually, tigers come from India.
- Pedantry is not a virtue, Edward.

36
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:33,762
- Will you be returning to Africa soon?
- I have no particular plans at present.

37
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:38,637
- Are you engaged to Lady Scarborough?
- You mustn't believe the newspapers.

38
00:04:38,807 --> 00:04:42,925
Lord Roxton!
Was it terribly dangerous in the jungle?

39
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:44,679
The odd rogue elephant.

40
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:48,522
Nothing as alarming as a society
hostess with marriageable daughters.

- Sorry, Mr McArdle.

before the first Angle, Celt or Saxon

set trepidatious foot on this sceptr'd isle,
those astonishing creatures,

he isn't a burglar or pickpocket.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

51
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:34,437
I see you're still having trouble
with your timekeeping, Professor Challenger.

52
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:37,405
(MAN) What have you got there, Challenger?

53
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:43,119
The Professor and I were at Oxford together.
He was often late for lectures then, as well.

54
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:46,677
I was punctual if I thought
there was something worth hearing.

55
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,156
Do you mind?

56
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:52,239
- Mrs Summerlee.
- George.

57
00:05:52,407 --> 00:05:54,159
George Challenger.

58
00:05:54,327 --> 00:05:58,798
A slapdash scientist
with an absurdly high opinion of himself.

59
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:02,721
Summerlee beat him to the Chair of Zoology.
He's never got over it.

60
00:06:02,887 --> 00:06:06,482
When Professor Challenger is finally ready,
perhaps I might continue?

61
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:08,797
Carry on, Professor.

62
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:16,446
The very word dinosaur,
meaning "terrible reptile", tells us...

63
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:21,761
...this is a vertebra from a creature
known as Iguanodon bernissartensis.

64
00:06:24,407 --> 00:06:27,877
Behind me is an artist's impression
of the iguanodon,

65
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:31,483
which stood on its hind legs
in the manner of a kangaroo.

66
00:06:31,647 --> 00:06:37,040
Oh, come on! A kangaroo?
Are you sure? Have you ever seen one?

67
00:06:37,207 --> 00:06:40,836
Don't be absurd!
No one's ever seen a dinosaur.

68
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:42,326
(LAUGHTER)

69
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:46,605
The great size of these creatures
was paradoxically their weakness,

70
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:52,080
for the dinosaurs could not compete
with the smaller and more agile mammals.

71
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:54,556
Where's his proof?

72
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:59,797
The proof is that we are here and dinosaurs
are remarkably thin on the ground.

73
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:01,958
(LAUGHTER)

74
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:05,043
Professor Summerlee...

75
00:07:05,687 --> 00:07:11,319
...I wonder if you would be kind enough
to identify something for me.

76
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:13,921
I will take questions at the end.

77
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:18,000
(CHALLENGER) I'm sure you will.
Let's have a look at this first.

78
00:07:21,327 --> 00:07:23,283
Now...

79
00:07:23,447 --> 00:07:26,007
...what do you make of that?

80
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:34,203
It appears to be
a remarkably well-preserved fossil

81
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:40,044
of the forearm of a pterosaur,
a flying reptile of the Mesozoic period.

82
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:43,643
But it isn't a fossil, is it?

83
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:48,917
There's something up here.
Make sure you get all this down.

84
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:52,281
Must be a fake.

85
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:55,519
Clever, undoubtedly, but a fake.

86
00:07:56,647 --> 00:08:00,481
This bone came from an animal...

87
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:04,885
...that died just two months ago.

- Yes.

I say that with authority.

91

- Because I shot it myself.

I should like to express my thanks
to Professor Challenger.

What exactly is your proposal?

The nest of the pterosaurs is deep
in a dense and unchartered region of Brazil.

109

Sounds perilous.
I should very much like to join you.

half the total costs incurred.

- You can look where you like,

but you won't get a penny from any

My name is Edward Malone.
I'm a reporter for The Gazette and...

will match Lord Roxton's offer.

- In that case, you're in!
- Have you gone mad?

- Then keep me on obituaries forever.

- I'm awfully proud of you.
- Are you really?

Of course. After all, I expect there'll
be poisonous snakes and hostile natives,

- Yes, I suppose.
- Good. Or what would be the point in going?

00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:03,999
8-calibre. Pistol grip to stock.

168
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:07,318
Nitro-express cartridge,
firing a charge of 12 drams.

169
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:12,163
- It'll knock down a charging bull elephant.
- There are no elephants in Brazil.

170
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:16,486
I know. But it doesn't hurt to be prepared.

171
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:19,005
Tell me, Mr Malone.

172
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:25,037
Have you ever been close enough to a really
dangerous wild animal to stare into its eyes?

173
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:30,359
I assume not. Shall I tell you
what you see there? Your own death.

174
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:32,836
An uncomfortable experience.

175
00:14:33,007 --> 00:14:36,716
On the contrary, it's profoundly stimulating.
You might want to get that down.

176
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:41,998
Gentlemen. If you please.

177
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:49,718
- Time to reveal our destination.
- Why did you have to be so secretive?

178
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:53,163
- He didn't trust us to keep our mouths shut.
- Yes.

179
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:58,321
Mr Malone has kindly agreed to keep
an accurate record of our progress.

180
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:03,038
Now... this is roughly
where I shot the pterosaur.

181
00:15:03,207 --> 00:15:06,722
It's right on the edge
of the unexplored regions.

182
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:11,597
When I got back, I found this account
of a Portuguese expedition

183
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:14,327
that went to the same region in 1649.

184
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:18,082
Only one man returned,
Father Luis Mendoz.

185
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:22,001
When they found him in the jungle,
it was assumed he was mad.

186
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:26,080
So we're going to be following a map
drawn up by a lunatic!

187
00:15:26,247 --> 00:15:29,125
- He was raving about dragons.
- Dinosaurs.

188
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:30,720
Exactly.

189
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:34,596
Now, according to Luis Mendoz,

190
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,123
there's a remote plateau
in the middle of the unmapped territory.

191
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:43,315
He says there's a cave system
leading right the way up to the summit.

192
00:15:43,487 --> 00:15:46,957
- His claim makes perfect sense.
- Why?

193
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:51,882
For a pterosaur or any other
prehistoric creature to have survived,

194
00:15:52,047 --> 00:15:56,518
it must have been isolated from
the mainstream of evolutionary development.

195
00:15:56,687 --> 00:16:01,124
Where do you propose we start
our search for this mythical plateau?

196
00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:06,281
- It wasn't mythical to Padre Mendoz!
- How very reassuring.

197
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:10,520
Your mind is as fossilised
as the exhibits in your precious museums!

198
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:13,565
- How dare you!
- Gentlemen! Please.

199
00:16:14,727 --> 00:16:18,163
There's a small mission
about a week's journey upriver.

200
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:20,887
It's run by a Reverend Theo Kerr.

201
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:24,517
A Theo Kerr wrote a very silly book
condemning Darwin.

202
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:27,724
- It's the same man.
- Oh, splendid.

203
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:46,363
(EDWARD) "Dear Mr McArdle, herewith
my first dispatch, together with expenses.

204
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:50,440

- Sh!

Professor Challenger? Agnes Cluny.
My uncle and I have been expecting you.

214
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:46,643
He went downriver for supplies.
He should be back today.

215
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:50,439
These are my colleagues. Lord Roxton.

216
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:52,199
- How do you do?
- Hello.

217
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:54,676
- Mr Malone.
- Hello.

218
00:17:54,847 --> 00:17:57,042
And Professor Summerlee.

219
00:17:58,087 --> 00:17:59,759
This way.

220
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:08,800
- This is Samuel, the lead bearer.
- Pleased to meet you.

221
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:13,324
He wants to know
which direction you're headed.

222
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:15,637
Ten days due north.

00:18:16,927 --> 00:18:19,077
(INDIAN LANGUAGE)

224
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:25,800
- Something wrong?
- The Indians say there are bad spirits there.

225
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:31,246
Ah, well. He may find this
more powerful than "curipuri".

226
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:33,686
(INDIAN LANGUAGE)

227
00:18:42,847 --> 00:18:44,166
Yes?

228
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:51,404
Ah, no. That to go. This to come back.

229
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:57,198
What did you tell him?

230
00:18:57,367 --> 00:19:01,360
That their wives will not thank them
if they refuse the work.

231
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,083
I'll take that.

232
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:35,517
Little Miss Muffet, she sat on a tuffet
eating her curds and whey. Along came a...

233
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:37,359
What ARE you on about?

234
00:19:42,887 --> 00:19:44,206
Stay still!

235
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:52,756
The tarantula
can give a nasty bite if provoked.

236
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:03,404
- Ugly brute, isn't it?
- I think they're fascinating.

237
00:20:07,727 --> 00:20:11,436
- Roxton, take charge here, will you?
- Just coming, Professor.

238
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:19,837
I was born here. My parents were botanists.

239
00:20:21,007 --> 00:20:24,682
They died in an accident on the river
when I was five.

240
00:20:24,847 --> 00:20:30,479
My uncle... I call Theo my uncle.
He was a good friend of my parents.

241
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,797
He brought me up.

242
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:36,036
They built this church.

243
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:42,836
In your letter you didn't say
exactly why you were coming here.

244
00:20:45,207 --> 00:20:48,199
- Of course, it's none of my business.
- No, no.

245
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:53,922
It would be unfair to enjoy your hospitality
and not tell you the truth.

246
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:59,366
- But you might find it hard to believe.
- You wouldn't be alone in that regard.

247
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:02,485

00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:21,878
Professor Challenger, I presume?

(OPERA: "THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO")

251
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:34,045
(ROXTON) Do you like opera, Miss Cluny?

252
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:37,358
It must be wonderful to see one.

253
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:40,599
Regarding Mendoz,
I've heard stories about him.

254
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,645
He was... oh, yes...

255
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:45,559
...quite mad.

256
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:51,359
- This "curipuri", what is that?
- Superstition.

257
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:54,803
Curipuri are the bad spirits
that haunt a man's dreams.

258
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:58,357
Sometimes they take the shape
of great birds or lizards.

259
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:01,200
You hear that, Leo?

260
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:05,121
You'll not find any dinosaurs
around here, gentlemen.

261
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:08,961
You're quite right to be sceptical, Reverend.

262
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:13,325
The Dinosauria became extinct
over sixty million years ago.

263
00:22:13,487 --> 00:22:18,436
Sixty million years.
My goodness, a long time.

264
00:22:18,607 --> 00:22:23,203
No. The Earth
is only 6,000 years old.

265
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:27,724
The calculation can easily be made
from the biblical evidence.

266
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:31,357
Do these calculations
take fossils into account?

267
00:22:31,527 --> 00:22:32,960
Of course.

268
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:39,077
Fossils are the remains of creatures
that were deposited after the great flood.

269
00:22:39,247 --> 00:22:42,364
The ones that didn't make it
into the ark, I suppose (!)

270
00:22:47,327 --> 00:22:51,081
I have to see to the lamps.
Goodnight, everyone.

271
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:57,006
I think I'll turn in, too. Goodnight.

272
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:10,400
I am aware, Professor,
that you disagree with my views.

273
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:14,799
But your theory of evolution
makes no sense to me.

274
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:20,439
- More than creating the world in seven days.
- Six. God rested on the seventh.

275
00:23:28,247 --> 00:23:31,478
Thank you for not laughing at my uncle.

276
00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:36,038
I don't share his beliefs but I respect his faith.

277
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:39,722
I have some difficulty
with Mr Darwin's monkeys myself.

278
00:23:43,687 --> 00:23:47,362
So many beautiful things
are hidden away in remote places.

279
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:50,644
I suppose that must be
the attraction for a scientist,

280
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:53,605
to discover one of those beautiful things.

281
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:56,361
But the Bible is not a textbook!

282
00:23:56,527 --> 00:24:00,998
- No, it's the word of God.
- It is no basis for serious science.

283
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:06,719
- You would replace God with man?
- And you'd replace science with twaddle?

284
00:24:14,927 --> 00:24:18,044
- Goodnight, gentlemen.
(SUMMERLEE) Goodnight, Reverend.

285
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:29,921
(EDWARD) Lord Roxton?
I wonder if I might have a word?

286
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:36,719
(EDWARD) Should you be flirting with her?
- Was I flirting? And what if I was?

287
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:39,321
- She's young.
- Not much younger than you.

288
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:42,126
'She's been brought up in the jungle. '

289
00:24:42,287 --> 00:24:45,199
- She has no idea of men and women.
- The birds and the bees.

290
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:50,680
I'm sure she's familiar with them,
not to mention every other biting insect.

291
00:24:50,847 --> 00:24:53,725
But it IS obvious that socially
she's a little...

292
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:59,644
- Well, backward.
- Edward, grateful as I am for this chat,

293
00:24:59,807 --> 00:25:04,835
and for your advice, but perhaps in future
you'd like to mind your own damn business!

294
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:09,686
Goodnight.

295
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,037
Goodnight.

296
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:27,558
- Agnes has just asked if she can join us.
- No, no, no.

297
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:32,403
She'd be very useful. She's an expert in local
medicines and speaks the Indian dialect.

298
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:35,479
Taking a woman on an expedition
is a bad idea.

299
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:40,243
Men can rub along and rough it together.
Women have different needs.

300
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:44,446
She's lived here all her life.
She'll be less of a liability than Mr Malone.

301
00:25:44,607 --> 00:25:48,156
(SUMMERLEE) I agree with Lord Roxton.
- So do I. We're entering into the unknown.

302
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:50,636
It's no place for women.

303
00:25:51,687 --> 00:25:57,603
My niece tells me she has offered
to go with you on your expedition.

304
00:25:57,767 --> 00:26:01,282
- Yes, we've just been discussing it.
- I cannot allow it.

305
00:26:01,447 --> 00:26:05,076
Agnes has been with me
since her parents died.

306
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:08,239
She's everything to me.

307
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:11,438
Oh, Agnes.

308
00:26:11,607 --> 00:26:14,644
I was just talking to Professor Challenger,
and he's agreed...

309
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:17,685
Why don't we ask Miss Agnes
what SHE wants to do?

310
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:19,485
George...

311
00:26:20,927 --> 00:26:25,796
We can't watch these people go off
into the jungle and not offer them our help.

312
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:31,795
Is it charity or your own ambition
that makes you want to go?

313
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:39,395
Does the Psalm not say,
"The Lord careth for the strangers"?

314
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:45,685
Don't worry, Reverend.
We'll get her back safely.

315
00:27:19,407 --> 00:27:24,083
"Six days upriver, we enter territory
where native tribes are beyond the reach

316
00:27:24,247 --> 00:27:26,807
"even of Christian missionaries.

317
00:27:29,687 --> 00:27:32,884
"We have been joined in our endeavours

TOO interested in us... yet."

- You suck the insect into the bag.
- I know how to use it, thank you.

327
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,606

"Just as the rigours of the expedition
were taking their toll,

496
00:45:19,447 --> 00:45:23,679
"Professor Challenger spotted
what seemed to be a route to the summit.

497
00:45:30,287 --> 00:45:35,361
"Though weak from hunger and exhaustion,
we applied ourselves to the ascent."

498
00:45:37,647 --> 00:45:41,879
(ROXTON) Well done, professors.
Not much further.

499
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:47,037
Come on, Edward.

(CHALLENGER GASPS)

501
00:46:15,927 --> 00:46:18,600
(CHALLENGER) Don't take it too high!

502
00:46:21,407 --> 00:46:24,240
We are going to need all the length.

503
00:46:28,967 --> 00:46:31,720
(CHALLENGER) Yes! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

504
00:46:37,607 --> 00:46:40,121
Perfect! Ha!

505
00:46:40,287 --> 00:46:44,838
Ladies and gentlemen,
I now declare this bridge open!

506
00:48:04,167 --> 00:48:06,635
(ROXTON) All right, all ready.
Start crossing.

507
00:48:06,807 --> 00:48:09,367
(SUMMERLEE) After you, George.

508
00:48:09,527 --> 00:48:14,043
I'm... I'm forgetting my manners.
Ladies first.

509
00:48:14,687 --> 00:48:16,359
(ROXTON) Ready.

510
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:23,398
Agnes, don't go.

511
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,637
It's all right, Uncle.

512
00:48:25,807 --> 00:48:28,526
- Don't!
- It's quite safe.

513
00:48:28,687 --> 00:48:31,076
(ROXTON) Come across. I promise it's safe.

514
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:53,644
(GASPS)

515
00:48:53,807 --> 00:48:55,957
(ROXTON) You're doing very well.

516
00:48:59,367 --> 00:49:01,039
Steady.

517
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,559
Well done!

518
00:49:23,247 --> 00:49:24,646
All right?

519
00:49:42,087 --> 00:49:44,043
Almost there.

520
00:49:46,287 --> 00:49:49,438
We've come this far. Just don't look down.

521
00:50:06,167 --> 00:50:10,319
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- Well done, Professor.

522
00:50:10,487 --> 00:50:12,000
Get his pack off.

523
00:50:12,167 --> 00:50:13,998
Ready, Professor?

524
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:18,320
See, it's easy. Easy as falling off a log.

525
00:50:30,447 --> 00:50:32,836
(HUMS QUIETLY)

526
00:50:39,927 --> 00:50:42,236
Oh-oh-oh!

527
00:50:46,887 --> 00:50:48,798
No!

528
00:50:48,967 --> 00:50:50,320
Ah!

529
00:50:50,487 --> 00:50:52,637
Hold on!

530
00:50:56,167 --> 00:50:58,362
Don't look down!

531
00:50:59,607 --> 00:51:01,120
I'm OK.
