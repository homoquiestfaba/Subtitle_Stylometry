1
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:13,007
That old lady
is crazy.

2
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,007
You can say
that again.

3
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,731
Good morning, all.

4
00:02:20,935 --> 00:02:22,197
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

5
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:25,236
We reviewed our cases
over the weekend?

6
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,428
Yes.

7
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,665
You're watching
that Mabel Simmons case.

8
00:02:28,876 --> 00:02:31,709
- It's all over the news.
- Right.

9
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:37,541
Now, that old woman has been giving
the police the blues all of her life.

10
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,947
- She was an ugly baby.
- Okay.

11
00:02:42,556 --> 00:02:44,922
- Petty theft at 9.
- Oh, my goodness.

12
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:47,385
Illegal gambling at 18.

13
00:02:47,594 --> 00:02:48,788
That Afro is thirsty.

14
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:50,429
Check fraud.

15
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:52,030
Not bad. Not bad.

16
00:02:52,232 --> 00:02:54,564
- Identify theft.
- Lord, help her.

17
00:02:54,768 --> 00:02:55,962
Insurance fraud.

18
00:02:56,337 --> 00:02:58,271
Okay, everything,
except attempted murder.

19
00:02:58,472 --> 00:03:00,440
- Attempted murder.
- There we go.

20
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:02,199
Oh, my goodness.

21
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:04,377
- Assault.
- Nice.

22
00:03:04,578 --> 00:03:09,208
The list goes on and on
and so on and so on.

23
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:14,115
Unfortunately, our fine officers may
have made a mistake on her takedown.

24
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:17,347
So we have to handle this with care.

25
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:18,751
Who wants it?

26
00:03:21,862 --> 00:03:24,626
Don't all volunteer at the same time.

27
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:26,493
You're supposed to be helping me.

28
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,260
We have no volunteers
for the Simmons case?

29
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:32,433
Okay.

30
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,970
Linda, it's all yours.

31
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:38,110
Thank you. Stop laughing.

32
00:03:38,312 --> 00:03:41,179
By the way, let's congratulate
our Linda Davis...

33
00:03:41,382 --> 00:03:43,577
...on her 89 percent conviction rate.

34
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:45,684
Thank you.

35
00:03:46,687 --> 00:03:49,155
With numbers like that,
you'll be DA one day.

36
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:51,290
- Okay.
- That's my girl.

37
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:56,020
Everyone else, let's check the boards
for the new cases and let's get to court.

38
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,720
All right.

39
00:04:02,136 --> 00:04:04,764
- Honey, there goes our appointment.
- I know.

40
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:06,530
And you're all broken up about it.

41
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,106
- I am. I got a lot of work anyway.
- I know.

42
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:12,210
That's all right. After this case,
it's just you and me, Tanya.

43
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:14,506
Good, that will give me time
to talk you out...

44
00:04:14,715 --> 00:04:16,979
...of these taffeta
bridesmaids dresses.

45
00:04:17,184 --> 00:04:19,311
Wha...? You like them,
don't you, baby?

46
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:22,581
Take my advice,
just nod and say yes.

47
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,815
- Of course.
- You're weak.

48
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:26,151
Yeah, he's smart.

49
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,021
- You're smart.
- I'm smart.

50
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:29,820
- Thank you.
- I'll see you later.

51
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,861
- All right.
- Sign that for me. Thank you.

52
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:34,626
- And you have fun with that.
- Thank you.

53
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:36,564
So...

54
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:39,566
- You set a date.
- Yes, I set a date.

55
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:41,638
You know you're gonna need
a best man.

56
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:42,968
Told you I got brothers.

57
00:04:43,177 --> 00:04:46,908
But your brothers have not been
the kind of friend that I've been to you.

58
00:04:47,114 --> 00:04:50,811
Chuck, the only reason you wanna be
in my wedding is you wanna be seen.

59
00:04:51,018 --> 00:04:52,280
- That hurts.
- Yes.

60
00:04:52,486 --> 00:04:53,510
That really hurts.

61
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,812
But you are right.

62
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:57,081
Linda's parents, they're loaded, Josh.

63
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,919
The governor's gonna be there.
The mayor's gonna be there.

64
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:02,186
- Get out of here.
- Come on. Hook your boy up.

65
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:04,694
- I need you to be my usher.
- I don't want... Listen.

66
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:06,763
- That's an important job.
- What can I say?

67
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:08,832
I just don't know.

68
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:12,130
I just don't know, Cora.
I just don't know.

69
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:16,671
Uncle Joe, are you all right?

70
00:05:18,412 --> 00:05:20,107
Uncle Joe?

71
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:23,515
Breathe, Joe, breathe.

72
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:29,178
You... You okay?

73
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:32,553
I'm good, Cora. Turn that oxygen up.

74
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,092
You're not supposed to be smoking
around oxygen. That's the problem.

75
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:38,662
Oxygen is everywhere in the air.

76
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:41,357
If you light a cigarette,
you're lighting it in oxygen.

77
00:05:41,568 --> 00:05:43,433
If you ain't got oxygen,
fire won't work.

78
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:46,538
- Learn some chemistry, honey. Learn.
- Chemistry?

79
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,198
What the hell you talking about?
You don't know what you talking about.

80
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,537
- Oh, you...
- This helps my...

81
00:05:52,746 --> 00:05:55,442
My blood pressure.
Smoke to help my blood pressure.

82
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:57,879
Fool around and blow you,
your blood pressure up.

83
00:05:58,085 --> 00:05:59,074
That's right.

84
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:00,719
This here is good for you.

85
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:02,081
It's good for you.

86
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:04,257
It came straight down from heaven.

87
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:08,053
God sent it down... And he sent Viagra.
He sent this and he sent that oxygen.

88
00:06:08,262 --> 00:06:11,493
You put them all together, you'll take
a woman to heaven and back.

89
00:06:11,698 --> 00:06:12,756
Thank you.

90
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:14,831
How you gonna sit there,
talk about God...

91
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:17,128
...with a joint in your hand
and some Viagra?

92
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:19,572
God made this.

93
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:24,901
He made the birds and the bees
and the flowers and these trees.

94
00:06:25,112 --> 00:06:29,310
Joe, you're just like your sister.
Both of y'all are going to hell.

95
00:06:31,552 --> 00:06:32,678
- What?
- Uncle Joe.

96
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:34,046
- You want some?
- Joe...

97
00:06:34,254 --> 00:06:36,984
- No. I need you to focus, Uncle Joe.
- Focus on what?

98
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:40,024
Why were you running from
the police? Madea? What happened?

99
00:06:40,227 --> 00:06:42,252
Mabel always running
from the police, Cora.

100
00:06:42,462 --> 00:06:44,953
You're mama been running
from the police. She's a ho.

101
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:47,599
Po-po. The po-po come,
she's running like a ho.

102
00:06:47,801 --> 00:06:49,769
Your mama always running
from the police.

103
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,165
I'm sorry to tell you,
your mama is a po-po ho.

104
00:06:52,506 --> 00:06:54,531
That fool is a thug.

105
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:58,438
That's right. Your mama a gangsta.
King Kong ain't got nothing on her.

106
00:06:58,645 --> 00:07:00,510
- Got nothing on her.
- Daddy.

107
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:04,417
- Stop talking about mama.
- I'm not talking about her.

108
00:07:04,618 --> 00:07:06,142
- You go on...
- How you all doing?

109
00:07:06,353 --> 00:07:07,843
- Hey, Brian.
- I just saw the news.

110
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:10,489
What is going on
with you and Madea?

111
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:14,153
- What's happening? Are you all right?
- I ain't all right.

112
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:15,919
What's wrong?

113
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:18,324
I can't feel my big toes.

114
00:07:18,532 --> 00:07:20,124
Thank you.

115
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:25,870
I'll tell you, when your parents get to be
a certain age, it's like raising children.

116
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:28,940
My kids don't give me trouble
like you and Madea are giving me.

117
00:07:29,142 --> 00:07:31,167
What is the matter?
Have you lost your mind?

118
00:07:31,378 --> 00:07:34,347
Madea's on probation. I don't know
what she was thinking about.

119
00:07:34,548 --> 00:07:37,039
That never stopped your mom.
I got her out of trouble.

120
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:38,809
She's going to jail this time.

121
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:42,284
To the big house, prison, the slammer.
They're gonna lock her up...

122
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:45,253
...press her down, shake it together,
gonna be in her bosom.

123
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:47,051
- I'm telling you, she...
- Mr. Brown!

124
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:49,818
Too much?

125
00:07:50,163 --> 00:07:52,063
- Yes.
- Yes.

126
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:55,196
Oh, wait, y'all go ahead.
Finish what y'all were saying.

127
00:07:57,604 --> 00:08:00,903
Come on, Cora, let's go to down there,
see if we can get her out there.

128
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:03,474
They gonna lock her up.
She's going to the slammer.

129
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:05,167
- To the big jail.
- Mr. Brown.

130
00:08:06,046 --> 00:08:09,573
- We don't need you to go.
- I got to go. They'll put her in Alcatraz.

131
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:13,549
She's gonna be in solitary condition.
They gonna lock her big behind.

132
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:15,312
- It's Alcatraz.
- Bye.

133
00:08:15,522 --> 00:08:17,080
Get the hell on out of here.

134
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,225
Better behave yourself while I'm gone.

135
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:20,957
What the hell I'm gonna do?

136
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:24,597
I'm so high, you look like
your real daddy right now.

<i>City of Atlanta v. Washington.</i>

138
00:08:36,443 --> 00:08:38,604
Miss, you were arrested
for prostitution.

139
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:39,972
Yes, Your Honor, she was.

140
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,114
Miss Washington...

141
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:44,708
...was arrested several times before.

142
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:49,355
Candy?

143
00:08:53,694 --> 00:08:57,425
- Joshua?
- I'm sorry, Your Honor. I need to...

144
00:08:57,798 --> 00:09:00,164
I need to pass this case
to my colleague.

145
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:02,301
It seems that I know this defendant.

146
00:09:02,502 --> 00:09:04,993
Then get it to one of your colleagues.

147
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:10,239
- Hey, what's going on?
- I know her.

148
00:09:10,544 --> 00:09:12,102
How?

149
00:09:13,714 --> 00:09:15,648
It's a long story, but will you take it?

150
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:17,111
What's the case?

151
00:09:17,317 --> 00:09:19,080
It's simple prostitution.

152
00:09:19,286 --> 00:09:21,447
Then you have to take
my drunk and disorderly.

153
00:09:21,655 --> 00:09:23,350
- Fine.
- Then give me a foot rub later.

154
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:25,149
- Okay.
- People, today.

155
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:28,886
Your Honor, Miss Washington has
been arrested twice for prostitution.

156
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:30,529
The people request no bail.

157
00:09:30,731 --> 00:09:33,359
This woman was simply
walking home from the bus stop...

158
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:38,630
Save it. Save it. Bail is set
at $ 1500 cash or bond until trial date.

159
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,933
- Fifteen hundred dollars?
- Yes, $ 1500.

160
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:44,469
Miss Washington,
if you manage to make bail...

161
00:09:44,678 --> 00:09:46,441
...you better be back for your trial.

162
00:09:46,646 --> 00:09:48,204
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah.

163
00:09:48,415 --> 00:09:50,679
If you're not here, you will regret it.

164
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:53,611
Go see the clerk for your trial date.

165
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:02,623

If the Lord get me out of this,
I'm going by the church.

169
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:13,168

- I'll go by the church.

- You better mean it.
- I mean it.

171
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:18,171
Hey, Judge.
Oh, girl, your hair is so pretty.

172
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:19,367
Who's doing your hair?

173
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:21,046
Lord, have mercy. How you doing?

174
00:10:21,648 --> 00:10:25,175
Mabel Simmons, you come before me
more than you go to the doctor.

175
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:28,548
Listen, I've changed my life.
I am living for the Lord.

176
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:30,518
- Since when?
- I am living for the Lord.

177
00:10:30,724 --> 00:10:32,316
I am living for the Lord.

178
00:10:32,526 --> 00:10:35,689
Hallelujah. I feel him down in my spirit.

179
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:39,263
You know, as I think
about the goodness of Jesus...

180
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:42,993
...and all that he has done for me...

181
00:10:43,203 --> 00:10:47,765
...my soul cries out,
"Hallelujah, thank God for saving me."

182
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:49,703
You finished?

183
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:54,907
I don't believe that no more than
I believe you will stay out of trouble.

184
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:57,276
- Your Honor, judge...
- Save it. I saw the video.

185
00:10:57,484 --> 00:11:01,944
And I told you that if she came back
before me again, she was going to jail.

186
00:11:02,155 --> 00:11:03,281
She's going to jail.

187
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,118
You're a lawyer.
You're supposed to be getting me off.

188
00:11:06,326 --> 00:11:08,385
You're weak-ass.
I gotta get me a real lawyer.

189
00:11:08,595 --> 00:11:11,723
Matt Johnson or somebody.
You weak-ass lawyer.

190
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:14,665
- Good Lord.
- Your Honor, there's something...

191
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:17,428
...you need to understand.
- There's nothing you can do.

192
00:11:17,637 --> 00:11:21,129
- She is going to jail this time.
- I don't know about that.

193
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:25,038
- And why not?
- Our officers forgot to Mirandize her.

194
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:28,112
I was waiting for Miranda to come in
and nobody came in.

195
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:31,546
That's right. Ain't nobody Miranda me.
Miranda wasn't in the room.

196
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:33,309
Excuse me?

197
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,249
We were fighting for our lives.

198
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:36,786
You forgot to Mirandize her?

199
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,424
That old woman got the strength
of any man.

200
00:11:42,696 --> 00:11:44,596
I've got to let you go.

201
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:46,766
You gotta let me go.

202
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:50,396
- As much as I hate it, I have to.
- Yes, you do.

203
00:11:50,604 --> 00:11:53,232
But I'm gonna suspend
your driver's license indefinitely.

204
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,566
Gonna suspend my license?

205
00:11:54,774 --> 00:11:57,538
My license been suspended.
Hell, you ain't doing nothing.

206
00:11:57,744 --> 00:12:01,202
I ain't had a license for 38 years.
She's gonna suspend my license.

207
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:03,712
What's that gonna do? I got keys.

208
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:06,511
I'm gonna order you
to anger management counseling.

209
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,745
She'll take it. Thank you.
We appreciate it.

210
00:12:08,955 --> 00:12:13,016
Go see the clerk. Get the paperwork
done and get her out of my courtroom.

211
00:12:13,226 --> 00:12:14,921
- You're free.
- Free? Look at my neck.

212
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:18,757
- Hold on. Did you see my eyes?
- Saw your eyes, saw that face too.

213
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:21,160
You're tore the hell up. I'm free to go.

214
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:24,929
I know you wish you was going home,
but I'm going home. I'm going home.

215
00:12:25,138 --> 00:12:28,335
Calm down, officer. It's your fault.
You forgot to Mirandize her.

216
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:30,567
- This is ridiculous.
- Take care, judge.

217
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:32,677
I love you, but I got to go.

218
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,006
But the saving grace is...

219
00:12:35,215 --> 00:12:38,981
...she couldn't stay out of trouble
if you paid her. She'll be back.

220
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:43,488
Hey, Joshua.

221
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,457
Hey.

222
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:47,687
Hey, Ellen.

223
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:50,387
- Who's this?
- This is Mindy.

224
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:52,064
Mindy.

225
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:54,233
Wait in the car, baby.

226
00:12:58,204 --> 00:13:00,331
She's only 14, Josh.

227
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,236
Pimp found her in the bus station,
put her in the streets.

228
00:13:03,643 --> 00:13:06,578
- Well, I'm glad you found her.
- Thank God.

229
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,804
Ellen, I...

230
00:13:08,014 --> 00:13:12,610
I gotta tell you, I think the job
that you're doing with these girls...

231
00:13:12,953 --> 00:13:14,386
...is great.

232
00:13:14,588 --> 00:13:17,989
- Just trying to do the work of my Lord.
- Well, I know you make him proud.

233
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:21,024
- Well, thanks again.
- All right.

234
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:22,990
Hey, Ellen. Wait.

235
00:13:23,196 --> 00:13:26,188
I want you to meet somebody. Candy.

236
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,890
This is Ellen Holmes.
She's a minister and she...

237
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:31,729
- She helps get girls off the street.
- Hi.

238
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:33,863
Hey.

239
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:36,239
Here is my card if you need anything.

240
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:38,707
Do I look like I'm on the streets to you?

241
00:13:38,912 --> 00:13:41,039
No, but you look like
you work in the streets.

242
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,943
You know what, I ain't got no time
for no Jesus jokers.

243
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:47,517
Fine. Then I ain't got time
for you either, sucker.

244
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:50,614
See you later, Joshua.

245
00:13:53,627 --> 00:13:54,992
What kind of minister is that?

246
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:58,426
I know, I know.
She's the real deal though.

247
00:13:58,632 --> 00:14:00,395
So you bailed me out?

248
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:01,993
Yeah.

249
00:14:02,202 --> 00:14:05,330
Where you wanna do this?
We can go to your car, to your house.

250
00:14:05,538 --> 00:14:07,870
- I'm not tripping.
- What are you talking about?

251
00:14:08,074 --> 00:14:09,837
You bailed me out.
You want something.

252
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:13,570
- Do you think I want sex from you?
- Well, what you want then?

253
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,578
What about, you know, how you been?
How are you doing?

254
00:14:16,783 --> 00:14:19,911
No man asking a woman how she
doing unless you want something

255
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,281
So, what is it?
What do you want from me, Josh?

256
00:14:22,489 --> 00:14:25,117
Okay. What are you doing
out here on these streets, Candy?

257
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:28,522
How about you don't worry about that?
I gotta go. I ain't got time...

258
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:31,060
Candy, hold on. Hold on. Just...

259
00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:33,698
All right. Let me take you
to get something to eat.

260
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,060
You hungry?

261
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:37,903
Come on.

262
00:14:38,772 --> 00:14:40,262
Please?

263
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:44,970
- The Lord is so good.
- Yes, he is.

264
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:48,306
He is so good, he delivered
your mama out of the belly of that jail.

265
00:14:48,515 --> 00:14:49,573
- Yes, he did.
- Yes.

266
00:14:49,783 --> 00:14:52,217
We're going to Church
Sunday, huh, Madea?

267
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,347
I ain't going to no church.

268
00:14:54,554 --> 00:14:56,818
Now, hold up. Wait a minute.

269
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,752
Let me put some church in it.

270
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,926
You said
if the Lord got you through this...

271
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:02,719
...you was going by the church.

272
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:05,523
That's just what I'm gonna do.
I'm going by the church.

273
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:08,223
- So when you coming?
- We just did.

274
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:10,960
I said I would go by the church.
We just passed by one.

275
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:12,604
Hallelujah. Saint Philip.

276
00:15:12,806 --> 00:15:14,740
Hail Mary full of grace
and all you people.

277
00:15:14,941 --> 00:15:16,966
God bless you.
All you people. Hello.

278
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,304
Oh, Mabel, the Lord is just so mad...

279
00:15:20,513 --> 00:15:23,744
You just make the Lord mad.

280
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,747
Bow your head. Let's pray for her.

281
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:26,941
Cora, bow your head.

282
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,412
Brian, bow your head.

283
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:30,316
- Mr. Brown, I'm driving.
- Yeah.

284
00:15:30,523 --> 00:15:32,855
The Lord can watch the wheels.
Bow your head.

285
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:34,185
Mabel, you bow your head.

286
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:36,521
Brown, if you don't shut the hell up
and...

287
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,028
Bow your head
and put your head in your lap...

288
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:41,029
...and smother yourself.
Bow your head.

289
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:43,862
Lord, don't send Madea to hell.

290
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,369
Just give her a little house
right outside the gates of heaven...

291
00:15:47,574 --> 00:15:50,202
...so she can watch all of us go in.

292
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,502
Amen.

293
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:53,838
- Amen.
- Amen.

294
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:57,608
But, Madea, you can't make those type
of promises and break them.

295
00:15:57,817 --> 00:15:59,580
- Cora.
- Yes?

296
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:01,754
- Do me a favor.
- Yes, ma'am.

297
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:05,857
Put the shut to the up, okay?
The shut to the up.

298
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:08,960
Mad... Cora, don't you worry.
Just let it go.

299
00:16:09,162 --> 00:16:11,892
When she gets in trouble,
she'll come running to the church.

300
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:15,261
Madea ain't gonna get in no more
trouble. I ain't gonna have that.

301
00:16:15,468 --> 00:16:17,436
Between you and my daddy,
that's enough.

302
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:20,401
You ain't getting in trouble.
You got off easy this time.

303
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:23,337
The hell you talking to? I'm grown.
I am grown, okay, Brian?

304
00:16:23,543 --> 00:16:25,306
You don't tell me nothing. I'm grown.

305
00:16:25,512 --> 00:16:27,810
I ain't got...
I wasn't in trouble that time.

306
00:16:28,014 --> 00:16:30,039
- I don't... You don't tell me nothing.
- Madea.

307
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,686
I was reading this pamphlet from
the courts about anger management.

308
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:35,821
It says as women get older...

309
00:16:36,022 --> 00:16:38,889
...our bodies don't produce
as many hormones as it needs...

310
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:40,992
...to stay calm and have stable moods.

311
00:16:41,194 --> 00:16:44,061
But you going to see this doctor
is gonna be real good for you.

312
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:46,289
I'm not going to no angry manager,
Cora.

313
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:48,490
What the hell you bring them
down here for?

314
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:50,828
Why are you yelling at me?
They wanted to come.

315
00:16:51,037 --> 00:16:53,528
What was I supposed to do?
Mr. Brown jumped in the car.

316
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,935
You was happy to see us
when you wanted prayer.

317
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:59,270
- That's right.
- You need to see one of them doctors.

318
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:02,607
They gave me one of them,
what they say, Brian?

319
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:04,579
Coca... Colostomy.

320
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:09,314
- You had a colonoscopy, Mr. Brown.
- Colostomy?

321
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:10,580
Same thing.

322
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:14,548
I thought that fool said Coca-Cola.
Making me thirsty for good old Coke.

323
00:17:14,761 --> 00:17:17,696
Now, Mabel, when we get old,
we gotta keep ourselves checked.

324
00:17:17,897 --> 00:17:19,956
Now, you know,
they checked my prostate.

325
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,396
Mabel, you need
to get your prostate checked too.

326
00:17:22,602 --> 00:17:24,331
Women don't have a prostate,
Mr. Brown.

327
00:17:24,537 --> 00:17:28,166
Cora, I'm telling you,
Madea got a prostate.

328
00:17:38,218 --> 00:17:40,652
You know there's more
where that came from.

329
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:51,252
- Why you bail me out of jail?
- Because you're a friend.

330
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:55,767
I don't understand why you...

331
00:17:55,969 --> 00:17:57,527
Why you have to do this.

332
00:17:57,737 --> 00:17:59,295
You was a... You were a smart girl.

333
00:17:59,505 --> 00:18:00,995
You used to get straight A's.

334
00:18:01,207 --> 00:18:02,970
You remember?

335
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:06,368
- What?
- You really have tricked yourself...

336
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:08,979
...into believing
that night ain't ever happened.

337
00:18:09,182 --> 00:18:11,207
Well, Josh, it did happen.

338
00:18:11,618 --> 00:18:14,178
And it changed my life forever.

339
00:18:18,591 --> 00:18:20,991
I tried to look for you every day
after that.

340
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:25,862
You must have been looking
in some pretty high places then.

341
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:29,193
Candy, I don't understand
why you are out there on those streets.

342
00:18:29,402 --> 00:18:32,803
Look, you deal with things your way
and I'll deal with them mine.

343
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:36,134
- I don't need you to be judging me.
- I'm not judging you.

344
00:18:36,342 --> 00:18:39,641
Yes, you are. What you do think
you're doing talking to me crazy?

345
00:18:39,846 --> 00:18:41,336
- Will you...?
- Don't you shush me.

346
00:18:41,547 --> 00:18:43,412
Telling me to...
Am I embarrassing you now?

347
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:45,743
Y'all got something to say too?
What you got?

348
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:47,681
- Anybody else?
- Please.

349
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:49,684
I'm not your enemy.

350
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,590
Hey. What's up, Josh?

351
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:55,818
Chuck, this is an old friend of mine.

352
00:18:57,363 --> 00:18:59,490
Okay. How you doing? I'm Chuck.

353
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:04,461
Okay.

354
00:19:05,672 --> 00:19:06,832
Hey, baby.

355
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,268
- Hey.
- Hey.

356
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:10,003
Thought you were in court?

357
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:12,939
I was. It got kicked.
She wasn't Mirandized.

358
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:15,840
What's this?

359
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,849
She's a friend of mine.

360
00:19:18,051 --> 00:19:19,484
What's her name?

361
00:19:19,686 --> 00:19:21,449
I...

362
00:19:21,921 --> 00:19:23,912
I tried your friend.

363
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:25,249
You made bail quickly.

364
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:29,326
Candy, this is my fiancée, Linda.

365
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:31,861
Oh, wait. Hold on.
You said that's your fiancée?

366
00:19:32,065 --> 00:19:34,124
You marrying her?

367
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:37,434
That'll never work.

368
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:45,070
I gotta go.

369
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:48,380
Hey, Candy.

370
00:19:48,581 --> 00:19:49,843
Look.

371
00:19:50,116 --> 00:19:52,107
This is my number.

372
00:19:52,585 --> 00:19:54,746
If you need anything,
give me a call, all right?

373
00:19:56,055 --> 00:19:57,522
Yeah.

374
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:19,439
- Well, are you gonna handle it?
- I... Yeah.

375
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:22,910
Honey,
you are an assistant district attorney.

376
00:20:23,116 --> 00:20:25,710
You shouldn't hang out
with the likes of those people.

377
00:20:25,918 --> 00:20:27,408
What are you doing with her?

378
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,451
Don't answer that.

379
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,449
She's an old friend.
I was trying to help.

380
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,287
Bad move.

381
00:20:38,398 --> 00:20:41,265
What did I say, Linda?
Didn't I? Didn't I say it?

382
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:42,491
What did you say?

383
00:20:43,436 --> 00:20:47,167
I was talking to your future wife here.
Remember that?

384
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,873
About the fact
that you feel guilty, Josh.

385
00:20:50,076 --> 00:20:53,944
I know. I made it out of the ghetto too
but I don't apologize for it.

386
00:20:54,147 --> 00:20:57,344
But these people,
oh, they will never let you forget.

387
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,316
As long as you let them do that,
you'll feel a sense of obligation to them.

388
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:03,785
- Now, am I right or am I right?
- That is not it.

389
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,389
Don't talk, just agree.

390
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:07,483
Well, whatever it is...

391
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:11,686
...the point is they were afforded
the same opportunities you were.

392
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:13,889
You did something, they didn't.

393
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,532
Linda, it's not always that simple.

394
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:20,168
Just agree to disagree
and change the subject.

395
00:21:20,373 --> 00:21:23,831
- Okay, can we just order some food?
- Yes.

396
00:21:26,045 --> 00:21:28,411
Oh, my dad is having a party here.

397
00:21:28,614 --> 00:21:31,139
I gotta go pick up my kids.
Y'all gotta handle this.

398
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,218
I know Joe ain't having no party
at my damn house.

399
00:21:36,856 --> 00:21:41,156
I know Joe ain't having no party
at my damn house.

400
00:21:42,295 --> 00:21:44,263
Wait, just stay calm.

401
00:21:45,231 --> 00:21:47,529
- Cora, who these people, Cora?
- I don't know.

402
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:50,861
- Cora, who these people in my house?
- I didn't know.

403
00:22:11,557 --> 00:22:13,491
- Holy smoke.
- Who are all these people?

404
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:14,682
The music's too loud.

405
00:22:14,894 --> 00:22:18,660
How could Joe have this party?
I know Madea gonna be upset.

406
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:22,931
Madea is upset.

407
00:22:23,136 --> 00:22:24,626
Hey, sexy.

408
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:27,864
You look like a bowl
of peach ice cream.

409
00:22:30,743 --> 00:22:33,940
Get out of my face
before I throw this oil all over you.

410
00:22:34,147 --> 00:22:36,945
Oh, now you wanna get kinky, huh?

411
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,447
- Kinky?
- I like that.

412
00:22:43,856 --> 00:22:46,416
- The devil is alive.
- Yeah.

413
00:23:03,943 --> 00:23:07,310
Hey, sexy,
you wanna spend some time with me?

414
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,447
And be my client?

415
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:11,139
What kind of work she do, Cora?

416
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,114
A lawyer in a sick room,
a doctor in the court room?

417
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,413
She's a... She's a prostitute.

418
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:18,119
Say it, baby.

419
00:23:18,324 --> 00:23:19,689
I'm a prostitute.

420
00:23:19,892 --> 00:23:23,487
- A prosti-what?
- A prostitute is what she said.

421
00:23:23,696 --> 00:23:26,187
Street walker. Woman of the night.

422
00:23:26,699 --> 00:23:28,860
Oh, Cora, give me that oil.

423
00:23:29,068 --> 00:23:30,330
The devil is alive.

424
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:33,164
The blood. The blood.

425
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:35,963
She's Mary Magdalene, Cora.

426
00:23:41,214 --> 00:23:42,841
Madea, just stay calm, okay?

427
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:45,142
Baby, don't have
no nervous breakdown.

428
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:47,911
Stay calm, Madea. Just stay calm.

429
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:52,152
- Mabel, just...
- Where the hell is Joe?

430
00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:53,825
He know I just got out of jail.

431
00:23:54,026 --> 00:23:58,224
Hey, Mabel. Hell, I didn't even know
you was coming home.

432
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:00,023
How are you doing? Good to see you.

433
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:02,201
Joe, who the hell are all these people?

434
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:06,303
When I saw the news,
I said they gonna lock my sister up.

435
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:10,032
So I've been inviting all these people
so that she could have a good time...

436
00:24:10,343 --> 00:24:12,834
...when she come home and I'm so...

437
00:24:13,145 --> 00:24:15,636
Yeah, right. You know better
than this, don't you, Joe?

438
00:24:15,848 --> 00:24:19,340
- Joe, what you doing? You all right?
- He is smoking out of this pipe.

439
00:24:19,552 --> 00:24:22,851
I'm glad you're home, Mabel.
I'm so glad you're home.

440
00:24:23,055 --> 00:24:24,886
Madea, I just want you to stay calm.

441
00:24:25,091 --> 00:24:27,719
All these people are for you,
Mabel, enjoy yourself.

442
00:24:27,927 --> 00:24:30,725
Enjoy yourself. Excuse me.
Excuse me, sexy slim.

443
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,922
- Just... You look calm. You calm?
- I'm calm. I'm clam.

444
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:38,126
- You look calm like a quiet storm.
- I'm calm. I'm calm.

445
00:24:42,808 --> 00:24:44,742
The hell you doing upstairs
in my house?

446
00:24:44,944 --> 00:24:47,105
And get the hell out of my bedroom.

447
00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:55,147
She's got a gun!

448
00:24:55,354 --> 00:24:58,983
Run! Run!

449
00:24:59,592 --> 00:25:00,923
I don't wanna die.

450
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,094
I can make it work. I can give you
some Indian hair. That's right.

451
00:25:11,304 --> 00:25:12,362
It'll be $ 75.

452
00:25:12,571 --> 00:25:14,971
You got to make that work.

453
00:25:15,174 --> 00:25:17,233
What about you?
What are you gonna have?

454
00:25:17,943 --> 00:25:19,638
- That's right.
- Hello, ladies.

455
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:22,606
- All right, thanks.
- There you go.

456
00:25:23,015 --> 00:25:24,573
- How are you doing?
- Thank you.

457
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:25,910
- Thank you.
- All right?

458
00:25:26,118 --> 00:25:29,815
Y'all take care of yourselves. Listen,
if you need anything, come see me.

459
00:25:30,022 --> 00:25:32,684
- 347 Chowder Lane.
- That's right.

460
00:25:32,892 --> 00:25:34,450
All right.

461
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,491
Take care of yourselves.

462
00:25:38,197 --> 00:25:40,563
- Hi, Donna.
- Hi, Ellen.

463
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:42,256
This is my friend, Candace.

464
00:25:44,337 --> 00:25:47,067
- Here we go again.
- We've met.

465
00:25:47,273 --> 00:25:51,039
This is my girl. We were in New York
together. I begged her to come here.

466
00:25:51,243 --> 00:25:54,007
- And she finally came.
- Is that right?

467
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,144
- Taking care of yourself?
- Why are you all in my business?

468
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,047
- All right, Candy, Ellen is good people.
- I'm just here to help.

469
00:26:01,253 --> 00:26:05,087
By thumping your Bible at me every five
minutes the way my grandmama did?

470
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:07,919
I don't know your grandmama
and I don't carry no Bible.

471
00:26:08,127 --> 00:26:09,287
It's at home on my mantel.

472
00:26:09,495 --> 00:26:11,622
You ain't got to carry it.
You know every word.

473
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,196
You better know it.

474
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:14,923
Amen.

475
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:18,860
Are you gonna give me some of them
or not?

476
00:26:20,506 --> 00:26:21,803
You asking me?

477
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:24,202
Go on, act right, man.
She's good people.

478
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:27,140
May I have some, please?

479
00:26:28,013 --> 00:26:29,640
"May I?"

480
00:26:30,282 --> 00:26:32,842
Girl, you're sounding all educated.

481
00:26:34,153 --> 00:26:35,347
Here.

482
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:40,483
Here's a voucher for some food
if you need it.

483
00:26:44,663 --> 00:26:47,393
- What?
- You don't know how to say thank you.

484
00:26:48,934 --> 00:26:50,196
Thank you.

485
00:26:50,603 --> 00:26:51,627
You on drugs?

486
00:26:51,837 --> 00:26:53,998
- Why?
- What is it, heroin or coke?

487
00:26:54,206 --> 00:26:57,198
Don't you be touching me. You don't
know me. You need to back up.

488
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,071
- You need some clean needles?
- I do.

489
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:00,939
- What's wrong with you?
- Here you go.

490
00:27:01,147 --> 00:27:02,614
Thank you.

491
00:27:02,815 --> 00:27:04,476
- Thank you.
- Take care of yourselves.

492
00:27:04,683 --> 00:27:06,981
And, Donna, I'm still waiting.

493
00:27:07,486 --> 00:27:08,885
I know.

494
00:27:11,624 --> 00:27:14,092
Donna, who is that fool?

495
00:27:15,094 --> 00:27:18,461
Man, I've been on these streets
since I was 16 years old.

496
00:27:18,664 --> 00:27:22,225
I've seen all kinds say they come
in the name of one God or another.

497
00:27:22,435 --> 00:27:24,460
But that woman right there...

498
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,228
...she's real.

499
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:28,999
She's good folks, man.

500
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:33,367
She'll be around all types
of dope boys, pimps, addicts.

501
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:35,547
And she treats us all the same.

502
00:27:35,748 --> 00:27:38,182
She preaches down at the prison.

503
00:27:39,251 --> 00:27:41,583
Why she say she waiting on you?

504
00:27:43,856 --> 00:27:46,586
I keep telling her I'll get off my street.

505
00:27:50,996 --> 00:27:52,657
No, sir. Well, I don't...

506
00:27:52,865 --> 00:27:55,026
Well, that's all I have. I...

507
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:58,529
That's the first and last name.

508
00:27:58,737 --> 00:27:59,931
That's all I have.

509
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:02,664
Sure. No, I understand.

510
00:28:03,742 --> 00:28:05,869
All right. Okay.

511
00:28:06,078 --> 00:28:08,046
Okay, thank you.

512
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:12,579
- Any luck?
- No.

513
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,149
What about you?

514
00:28:17,356 --> 00:28:18,721
Nope.

515
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:22,486
Man, you know, tell me again,
why are we doing this?

516
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:26,222
I'm just trying to find somebody
to help her get off these streets.

517
00:28:26,432 --> 00:28:29,595
You've... You've never done this before
so it's...

518
00:28:30,102 --> 00:28:31,626
We got history.

519
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:34,263
Oh, you...

520
00:28:34,473 --> 00:28:37,101
- Not like that.
- You're trying to help this girl, man.

521
00:28:37,309 --> 00:28:40,767
And I've never heard you mention her.
I've known you for, like, three years.

522
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,542
We're supposed to be looking for
vacation spots for your honeymoon.

523
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:47,412
- We are.
- No, no, no. We.

524
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,986
You called me up,
you said, man, come over here.

525
00:28:50,723 --> 00:28:52,384
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, how are you doing?

526
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:53,990
- How are you?
- Oh, I am good.

527
00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:57,219
Okay, you know what,
I'm gonna leave you lovebirds alone.

528
00:28:57,429 --> 00:28:58,862
- I gotta...
- Where you off to?

529
00:28:59,064 --> 00:29:00,053
I gotta...

530
00:29:00,266 --> 00:29:03,633
- You ain't going nowhere.
- I got a date, so... Yeah.

531
00:29:03,836 --> 00:29:05,997
- What's your date's name?
- Well, lucky girl.

532
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:08,036
Leave me alone. I'm out.

533
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,174
So today was incredible.

534
00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:13,504
I found these shoes.
The girls are gonna flip out.

535
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:17,512
I found the most amazing dressmaker
and she agreed to do the dress for us.

536
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:19,616
- That's great.
- I know.

537
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:22,748
Did you find any places
for the honeymoon?

538
00:29:24,123 --> 00:29:26,284
No, actually I was...

539
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,153
I was...

540
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,057
I was looking for some of
Candace's family in Texas.

541
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,697
Okay, so you're still talking
about this prostitute?

542
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:39,769
- Why are you calling her a prostitute?
- That what she is.

543
00:29:39,972 --> 00:29:44,170
Baby, where I'm from, if somebody
needs help, you try to help them out.

544
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:45,638
Okay, sweetie...

545
00:29:45,844 --> 00:29:48,972
...you know that you can only
help someone that wants to be helped.

546
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:50,580
Those people don't want help.

547
00:29:50,783 --> 00:29:53,775
- Why do you call them those people?
- I mean, those people.

548
00:29:53,986 --> 00:29:56,750
People like her,
from that side of the tracks.

549
00:29:56,956 --> 00:29:58,821
I'm from the same street.

550
00:29:59,024 --> 00:30:02,016
- We were in college together.
- That doesn't make any difference.

551
00:30:02,227 --> 00:30:04,058
It's not the same thing with you.

552
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:05,560
Sweetie, she's not like you.

553
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:09,530
It is her own fault if she didn't
make something of herself.

554
00:30:09,735 --> 00:30:12,761
Linda, you've always had things
handed to you.

555
00:30:13,472 --> 00:30:16,441
You've always been, like,
daddy's little princess.

556
00:30:16,642 --> 00:30:19,076
Until you're on the streets,
you wouldn't understand.

557
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:20,836
That is my cue to leave.

558
00:30:21,246 --> 00:30:24,181
- I'm gonna let you cool off for a minute.
- Wait, Linda.

559
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:26,177
- Yes?
- I'm sorry.

560
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:29,718
I am, but it bothered me seeing
that woman on the street.

561
00:30:29,922 --> 00:30:32,049
- It bothers you.
- Yes, it bothers me.

562
00:30:32,257 --> 00:30:36,284
Okay, when she stops bothering you,
why don't you give me a call?

563
00:30:36,495 --> 00:30:39,396
- Linda. Linda, hey.
- Okay?

564
00:30:39,765 --> 00:30:42,928
- I don't want you to go.
- I don't wanna hear about this girl.

565
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:44,329
I'm done with her.

566
00:30:44,536 --> 00:30:46,265
Now, you've helped her enough.

567
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:48,266
You won't hear about it again.

568
00:30:56,248 --> 00:30:58,148
You still out here?

569
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:02,351
Yeah, girl. It's a slow night.

570
00:31:02,554 --> 00:31:04,852
No, it's not.
Those Army boys just got paid.

571
00:31:05,057 --> 00:31:08,151
Turned down, like, three
when I was here before.

572
00:31:08,661 --> 00:31:10,492
What's up, girl?

573
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:15,422
I ran into somebody who I knew
from before earlier today.

574
00:31:15,634 --> 00:31:17,192
Oh, I see.

575
00:31:17,703 --> 00:31:20,103
You started thinking
what your life could have been.

576
00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:24,435
No, not me. I know I ain't got no time
to be chasing no dreams.

577
00:31:25,277 --> 00:31:27,507
You ain't like the rest of us, Candy.

578
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,781
You can get out of here
and make something of yourself.

579
00:31:30,983 --> 00:31:33,178
What, me some Betty Crocker mom
or something?

580
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:35,615
No, you smart.

581
00:31:36,555 --> 00:31:38,523
I see how you be reading them books.

582
00:31:38,724 --> 00:31:43,184
Listen, Terry McMillan ain't doing
nothing to get me no fix, okay?

583
00:31:43,729 --> 00:31:47,756
All I'm saying is if anybody
can get out of here, you can.

584
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,623
I've seen you talk to people.

585
00:31:49,835 --> 00:31:52,429
I've seen you talk your way
out of all kinds of stuff.

586
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:54,299
You can do it.

587
00:31:54,506 --> 00:31:56,770
Whatever, Donna. Please.

588
00:31:56,975 --> 00:31:59,136
All right, I'm gonna make a deal
with you.

589
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:03,472
If I get off these streets,
you gotta get off these streets.

590
00:32:05,984 --> 00:32:08,009
All right, that's a bet.

591
00:32:08,454 --> 00:32:10,786
Maybe we can help each other.

592
00:32:10,989 --> 00:32:14,390
Now, you know we always do, girl.
You know what I was thinking about?

593
00:32:14,593 --> 00:32:16,891
- Remember we were in New York?
- Donna!

594
00:32:17,096 --> 00:32:18,723
Candy, come on. Run. Run!

595
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:35,403
- You think you can hide from me?
- No.

596
00:32:35,614 --> 00:32:39,380
I told you, you ain't gonna be out
here solo, Donna. Do you hear me?

597
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:42,744
- Okay.
- Now, get your ass out of here.

598
00:32:42,955 --> 00:32:44,286
Okay, Donna. Let's go.

599
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,720
- No, no, no. Not you.
- No. What do you want?

600
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:48,586
You want a woman.
You don't want her.

601
00:32:48,794 --> 00:32:51,854
- I see what I want. Get out of here.
- She's just been here.

602
00:32:52,064 --> 00:32:55,431
I'm trying to show her the ropes.
She ain't ready. She ain't ready!

603
00:32:57,536 --> 00:32:59,333
Get off of her!

604
00:33:02,007 --> 00:33:05,204
Where you think you're going?
Where do you think you're going, girl?

605
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:08,675
You ain't going nowhere.
You understand me?

606
00:33:55,928 --> 00:33:58,954
- Where do you think you're going?
- Please, please, please.

607
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:01,291
I won't tell anybody, I promise.

608
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,560
- What, you think that scares me?
- Please.

609
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,069
Please. Please let me go.
Please let me go.

610
00:34:08,273 --> 00:34:10,673
What are you gonna do for me
if I let you go?

611
00:34:10,876 --> 00:34:12,605
What do you want me to do?

612
00:34:13,478 --> 00:34:14,775
You belong to me.

613
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,971
You're my slave.

614
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:20,811
If a slave wanna be free,
they got to buy their freedom.

615
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:23,214
Okay. Okay.

616
00:34:23,422 --> 00:34:25,583
I want you to get in that bathroom.

617
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:27,224
I want you to get cleaned up.

618
00:34:27,426 --> 00:34:29,417
I can get a premium for you.

619
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:31,887
All right, go on, baby.

620
00:34:33,432 --> 00:34:35,491
Come on, it's all right.

621
00:34:40,772 --> 00:34:44,606
Gonna learn you ain't protected on
these streets unless you got a pimp.

622
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,300
Do you understand?

623
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:48,843
I got this nice party
I'm gonna take you to.

624
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:53,074
A lot of new potential clients,
couple of G's easy.

625
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:55,651
I want you to make yourself
look real nice, girl.

626
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:57,845
I got a good feeling about you.

627
00:34:58,056 --> 00:35:00,786
You're gonna be
one of my special girls.

628
00:35:01,293 --> 00:35:03,761
Don't be wasting time in there, girl.
Come on, now.

629
00:35:03,962 --> 00:35:06,396
We gotta be running now.
I don't wanna be late.

630
00:35:09,868 --> 00:35:12,837
Get on with that shower in there,
Candy.

631
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,466
What's going on in there?

632
00:35:15,674 --> 00:35:16,971
Candy.

633
00:35:17,175 --> 00:35:18,608
Candy.

634
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:03,180
Operator, I need district attorney...

635
00:36:03,388 --> 00:36:04,980
...Josh Hardaway.

636
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,954
Just connect me to his phone, please.
It's an emergency.

637
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,239
Hello.

638
00:36:25,577 --> 00:36:27,010
Hey.

639
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:29,375
You okay?

640
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:31,608
Are you serious?

641
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:33,512
Where are you?

642
00:36:34,419 --> 00:36:36,614
Okay, I'm coming right now.

643
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:39,757
I'm coming r... I'm coming right now.

644
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:42,854
All right. I know. All right.

645
00:36:43,061 --> 00:36:44,426
Bye.

646
00:37:22,868 --> 00:37:23,960
Candace.

647
00:37:24,169 --> 00:37:25,727
Can you walk? Come on.

648
00:37:25,937 --> 00:37:28,167
Come on. Come on. Come on.

649
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:29,931
Thanks. I'm okay.

650
00:38:43,682 --> 00:38:45,377
Baby?

651
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:48,818
I fell asleep.
How come you're not in bed, sweetie?

652
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,988
What? What's the matter?

653
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,952
I can explain. I can...

654
00:38:53,158 --> 00:38:54,386
Is that my robe?

655
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:57,357
- You can explain?
- She's in trouble. I'm trying to help.

656
00:38:57,562 --> 00:38:58,790
Why did you bring her here?

657
00:38:58,997 --> 00:39:00,464
Linda, she needs somebody.

658
00:39:00,665 --> 00:39:02,257
I don't care what she needs.

659
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:04,765
Shush? Are you kidding me?

660
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,962
What is it with you and this girl?
What is going on here?

661
00:39:08,173 --> 00:39:10,073
Linda, I told you.

662
00:39:10,275 --> 00:39:12,300
- I'm the only one that can help her out.
- No.

663
00:39:12,511 --> 00:39:16,971
You have some decisions to make
and some thinking to do. I am leaving.

664
00:39:17,182 --> 00:39:20,413
And stop shushing me. Shushing me
so the prostitute can sleep?

665
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:21,779
I am done, Josh.

666
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:23,079
I cannot believe this.

667
00:39:23,288 --> 00:39:25,518
Linda, just don't slam the door.

668
00:39:25,724 --> 00:39:27,487
You slammed it.

669
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:29,349
Can't even shut the door...

670
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:32,359
You always did know
how to pick them.

671
00:39:32,564 --> 00:39:34,589
She's not your type.

672
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:38,401
How you know what my type is?

673
00:39:38,603 --> 00:39:40,537
You haven't seen me in five years.

674
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:42,900
Josh, I know you, okay?

675
00:39:43,108 --> 00:39:44,973
She is not it.

676
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:48,578
She's entirely too much of a princess.

677
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,941
It ain't gonna work.

678
00:39:51,149 --> 00:39:55,245
I bet...
I bet you ain't even proposed to her.

679
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:59,020
Then why do you think
we're getting married then, smarty?

680
00:39:59,224 --> 00:40:01,021
Because she told you you were.

681
00:40:01,226 --> 00:40:02,659
Oh, you don't know me.

682
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:05,125
You think you know me
but you don't know me, girl.

683
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,628
Josh, I know you. We grew up toge...

684
00:40:07,832 --> 00:40:11,427
We spent every day together
when we were kids.

685
00:40:11,636 --> 00:40:13,331
I know you.

686
00:40:13,538 --> 00:40:15,301
Candace, people change.

687
00:40:16,575 --> 00:40:18,566
I know that's right.

688
00:40:21,446 --> 00:40:23,505
- You're shaking. Are you cold?
- No.

689
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:27,647
This ain't the cold shakes, baby.

690
00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:30,353
When did you start using?
When you got out of school?

691
00:40:31,022 --> 00:40:34,116
I had to find some way to cope
just like you.

692
00:40:34,326 --> 00:40:36,817
What are you talking about, me?

693
00:40:37,028 --> 00:40:41,021
Ambition, working two jobs.

694
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,995
While you were in school full-time?

695
00:40:44,202 --> 00:40:47,069
You did that so you wouldn't have
to think about what happened.

696
00:40:47,272 --> 00:40:50,241
That's an interesting concept you got.

697
00:40:50,775 --> 00:40:53,369
Josh, I don't wanna
talk about this, okay?

698
00:40:54,412 --> 00:40:57,848
All right, we don't have to.
We don't have to talk.

699
00:41:01,052 --> 00:41:02,041
Hey, Josh.

700
00:41:02,687 --> 00:41:03,881
Yeah.

701
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:09,053
You remember that bed and breakfast
we were gonna open in Savannah?

702
00:41:09,294 --> 00:41:12,161
Down by the river. Bells.

703
00:41:12,364 --> 00:41:13,490
I remember Bells.

704
00:41:13,698 --> 00:41:15,928
- You remember?
- Yeah, I remember.

705
00:41:16,468 --> 00:41:18,436
Oh, Josh.

706
00:41:18,637 --> 00:41:21,128
I was gonna buy it...

707
00:41:21,673 --> 00:41:24,665
...and live happily ever after.

708
00:41:25,143 --> 00:41:27,270
So why didn't you buy it?

709
00:41:27,846 --> 00:41:30,337
I couldn't find a job...

710
00:41:32,484 --> 00:41:37,751
...and I ain't have no money,
I was so hungry.

711
00:41:40,392 --> 00:41:41,757
And then I...

712
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,188
...I met this man.

713
00:41:44,296 --> 00:41:46,787
And he said he loved me.

714
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,534
And he said he was
gonna take care of me.

715
00:41:51,269 --> 00:41:55,103
And he said that if I loved him
that I would...

716
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,770
...sleep with him and his friend.

717
00:41:57,976 --> 00:42:02,174
And it turned into
his other friends without him.

718
00:42:02,914 --> 00:42:05,314
And then strangers.

719
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:08,248
It took me four years...

720
00:42:08,453 --> 00:42:10,250
...four years...

721
00:42:10,455 --> 00:42:12,582
...to get away from him.

722
00:42:13,725 --> 00:42:15,090
CeCe, I'm sorry.

723
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,822
CeCe?

724
00:42:17,295 --> 00:42:18,421
Yeah.

725
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,963
That little girl,
she died a long time ago.

726
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:29,405
Boy, are those tears in your eyes?

727
00:42:29,974 --> 00:42:33,466
You better man up. Don't you sit
over there feeling sorry for me.

728
00:42:34,212 --> 00:42:36,407
At least I get paid for what I do now.

729
00:42:36,614 --> 00:42:39,378
You do not get paid for what you do.

730
00:42:42,587 --> 00:42:45,055
I told y'all I ain't got no
anger-manager problem.

731
00:42:45,256 --> 00:42:46,951
Y'all still insisted on me going.

732
00:42:47,158 --> 00:42:48,750
You have a anger-management
problem.

733
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,325
Fine, take me down there then.

734
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:52,826
That's why I'm gonna get you
one of these.

735
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:55,522
- One of what?
- This, right here, one of these.

736
00:42:55,734 --> 00:42:58,965
- What is that?
- It's a reminder on how to treat people.

737
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:01,229
WWJD.

738
00:43:01,439 --> 00:43:02,804
You know what that means?

739
00:43:03,241 --> 00:43:06,301
What that stand for?
What's wrong with Jermaine Dupri?

740
00:43:06,511 --> 00:43:09,105
No. It means "What would Jesus do?"
Everybody know that.

741
00:43:09,314 --> 00:43:11,305
I don't know. Hell.

742
00:43:12,117 --> 00:43:13,948
Did you see that?

743
00:43:14,853 --> 00:43:17,219
- Did you see him?
- Yes, I saw it. What you gonna do?

744
00:43:17,422 --> 00:43:21,483
- Well... What... I'm gonna WWJD.
- Cora, Jesus did not have no car.

745
00:43:21,693 --> 00:43:23,752
- Better go get that fool.
- He's gonna get his.

746
00:43:23,962 --> 00:43:25,020
- No, I can't.
- Cora.

747
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,698
He's gonna get his.
Look. He got stopped by the light.

748
00:43:28,299 --> 00:43:29,857
Well, pull up on him, then.

749
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:31,831
- Okay.
- I'm gonna do a drive-by.

750
00:43:32,036 --> 00:43:33,697
Madea... No, you're not.

751
00:43:33,905 --> 00:43:36,305
Oh, man, I got this. I got this.

752
00:43:36,508 --> 00:43:37,497
Excuse me, sir.

753
00:43:37,709 --> 00:43:39,040
- Excuse me.
- Hey, fool.

754
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:42,213
- What?
- You cut in front of me. Did you see?

755
00:43:42,414 --> 00:43:44,382
Go to hell.

756
00:43:44,949 --> 00:43:46,644
Wh... Did... What?

757
00:43:47,118 --> 00:43:49,848
- Did you hear that?
- Did you show him your bracelet?

758
00:43:50,054 --> 00:43:52,887
- Did you show him the WWJD?
- Don't be funny, Madea.

759
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:54,683
Cora, I didn't raise no punk.

760
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:57,293
- You better go get that fool.
- I'm no punk, Madea.

761
00:43:57,495 --> 00:44:00,328
- Cora, you ain't gonna be no punk.
- I'm not no punk. I'm not...

762
00:44:06,304 --> 00:44:09,603
I stopped that fool in his face,
you goddamn fool!

763
00:44:27,525 --> 00:44:28,514
Mama.

764
00:44:30,195 --> 00:44:32,186
Girl, I ain't your mama.

765
00:44:36,734 --> 00:44:38,201
Good morning.

766
00:44:38,403 --> 00:44:40,894
What are you, a size 5-, 6?

767
00:44:41,105 --> 00:44:42,265
Why?

768
00:44:42,607 --> 00:44:44,905
Probably a 3.
You don't look like you eat much.

769
00:44:45,944 --> 00:44:47,377
Joshua?

770
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:48,876
What the hell is this?

771
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,378
We both set up a job interview for you.

772
00:44:51,816 --> 00:44:53,807
I think I can cover that eye up.

773
00:44:54,419 --> 00:44:57,718
We have companies working with our
ministries to get women off the street.

774
00:44:57,922 --> 00:44:59,253
That's if you wanna be.

775
00:44:59,457 --> 00:45:01,322
Who said I wanted to be, huh?

776
00:45:01,526 --> 00:45:03,756
- Candy, that's what you wanted.
- Well, I told you.

777
00:45:03,962 --> 00:45:06,931
Sometimes women like her
say one thing one day.

778
00:45:07,398 --> 00:45:09,559
And then they wake up
and say another thing.

779
00:45:09,767 --> 00:45:11,860
What do you mean girls...?
You don't know me.

780
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:15,665
Chicks. Junkies like you with
a problem say one thing one day...

781
00:45:15,874 --> 00:45:18,342
...and another the other
because you're on that stuff.

782
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,470
- Go to hell.
- You go first.

783
00:45:22,046 --> 00:45:23,911
I ain't no damn addict.

784
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:27,312
Candy.

785
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:32,183
Candy, if the public defender can
show the judge that you got a job...

786
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:33,948
...it's gonna look really good.

787
00:45:34,158 --> 00:45:36,149
And they may even
suspend your sentence.

788
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:37,350
I need to know.

789
00:45:39,097 --> 00:45:40,724
I need you to try this, please.

790
00:45:40,932 --> 00:45:42,058
Fine.

791
00:45:42,267 --> 00:45:43,791
Fine.

792
00:45:44,002 --> 00:45:45,469
Fine.

793
00:45:48,673 --> 00:45:49,765
Thank you.

794
00:45:49,974 --> 00:45:51,703
Okay, we'll see you there.

795
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:55,505
I gotta go to work. After you're done,
can you come to the courthouse?

796
00:45:55,713 --> 00:45:59,843
I wanna talk to your lawyer. I'm gonna
see if I can help him through this.

797
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:01,518
Okay?

798
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:05,211
Yeah. Okay. Sure.

799
00:46:13,731 --> 00:46:15,824
You wanna try to get this job or not?

800
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:22,032
I told them I didn't need
to come here and see you, okay?

801
00:46:22,407 --> 00:46:24,932
Well, you know,
I don't usually see people individually.

802
00:46:25,143 --> 00:46:29,136
But when I saw this tape
of you getting arrested...

803
00:46:29,347 --> 00:46:31,815
...I thought I have got
to talk to this woman.

804
00:46:32,016 --> 00:46:36,077
What is wrong with you?
Why are you so angry?

805
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:39,313
First of all, ain't nothing wrong
with me. Secondly, I'm not angry.

806
00:46:39,524 --> 00:46:40,752
Okay? I'm not angry.

807
00:46:40,959 --> 00:46:42,824
- You seem angry now.
- No, I'm not angry.

808
00:46:43,027 --> 00:46:45,325
This is how I am.
I don't have no hostility at all.

809
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:48,829
Well, do you have to be in control
all the time of everything?

810
00:46:49,033 --> 00:46:51,433
I don't have to be.
I ain't got no problem with that.

811
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:53,361
Well, then why
do you get so angry?

812
00:46:55,373 --> 00:46:58,638
I keep trying to tell you
and that judge that I do not get angry.

813
00:46:58,843 --> 00:47:00,208
Somebody do something to me...

814
00:47:00,411 --> 00:47:02,504
...I do something to them.
That's common sense.

815
00:47:02,714 --> 00:47:06,115
- So you believe in getting even?
- Hell to the yeah.

816
00:47:06,317 --> 00:47:08,717
Why do you feel
you gotta get somebody all the time?

817
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,150
"Get him, get him."
You don't think that's angry?

818
00:47:11,356 --> 00:47:13,551
If they: "Got me,"
I gotta get them, get them.

819
00:47:13,758 --> 00:47:16,659
- That's what it is.
- Then, what you call getting got...

820
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:19,386
...is different than what
other people call getting got.

821
00:47:19,597 --> 00:47:21,690
It doesn't take much to get you,
does it?

822
00:47:21,899 --> 00:47:24,663
When you getting got, somebody
got you, then you go get them.

823
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:26,234
Everybody's gonna get got.

824
00:47:26,437 --> 00:47:28,371
But if you're getting somebody
got you...

825
00:47:28,573 --> 00:47:30,040
...when they didn't get you...

826
00:47:30,241 --> 00:47:32,732
...you're getting the gotters,
they didn't do anything.

827
00:47:32,944 --> 00:47:35,174
But if the gotters get me,
I'm gonna get my Glock.

828
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,248
Yeah, well... But you don't get
the Glock when you hadn't been got.

829
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:41,816
What I'm trying to explain,
I don't care who got me.

830
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:45,285
- I'll get them first. Get me, I'll get you.
- Why is it so important?

831
00:47:45,857 --> 00:47:48,155
Okay. I'm tired of you
asking me these questions.

832
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:49,621
I didn't sign up for this.

833
00:47:49,827 --> 00:47:51,692
It's the judge
that told me to come here.

834
00:47:51,896 --> 00:47:54,990
Everybody wants to get even.
Everybody wanna get even.

835
00:47:55,299 --> 00:47:56,391
All right, all right.

836
00:47:56,601 --> 00:47:59,001
Look, let's just talk
about your childhood, okay?

837
00:47:59,203 --> 00:48:01,637
- Let's talk about your childhood.
- Talk about yours.

838
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,966
Let's talk about your childhood.

839
00:48:04,175 --> 00:48:06,302
Let's talk about your childhood.

840
00:48:09,714 --> 00:48:12,945
Talking about my childhood
isn't gonna help us.

841
00:48:13,618 --> 00:48:16,246
- What was your childhood like?
- What was yours like?

842
00:48:16,454 --> 00:48:18,354
Why...? Let's talk about your anger.

843
00:48:18,556 --> 00:48:22,822
- That's why you're here, right?
- I'm not angry. I don't know why.

844
00:48:23,461 --> 00:48:27,022
- Let's just try another approach, okay?
- Let's try another approach.

845
00:48:27,265 --> 00:48:28,960
Do you sleep well at night?

846
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:30,498
Do you sleep well at night?

847
00:48:30,968 --> 00:48:33,266
Let's try not to answer a question
with a question.

848
00:48:33,471 --> 00:48:35,701
Could we do that?
Could we at least do that?

849
00:48:35,907 --> 00:48:37,932
If we stop asking me
all these questions...

850
00:48:38,142 --> 00:48:40,201
...I won't have to answer
with a question.

851
00:48:40,411 --> 00:48:43,938
- Can you stop? Can you just stop?
- Can you just stop? Can you just stop?

852
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:48,678
- Are you getting angry, doctor?
- Okay. This isn't getting anywhere.

853
00:48:48,886 --> 00:48:52,344
- This is not getting anywhere.
- I think I am gonna talk to the judge.

854
00:48:52,557 --> 00:48:54,388
This is getting nowhere. We're done.

855
00:48:54,592 --> 00:48:55,957
- Thank you.
- Okay. That's good.

856
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,561
- Wonderful to see you. Yes. Right.
- Yeah, well... Yeah, great.

857
00:49:00,798 --> 00:49:04,359
- Come on. Let's get the hell out of here.
- Wait a minute.

858
00:49:05,169 --> 00:49:07,535
- Well?
- This lady is out of control.

859
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:09,138
She is... I can't help her.

860
00:49:09,974 --> 00:49:12,738
Wait a minute now, wait a minute now.
Now, you're the best.

861
00:49:13,044 --> 00:49:17,538
- Go see somebody else. I'm done.
- Come on, Cora, here.

862
00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:20,047
Oh, what am I gonna...?

863
00:49:20,251 --> 00:49:22,583
Nobody gonna be able to help.
We ain't gonna...

864
00:49:26,858 --> 00:49:28,086
Linda.

865
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,418
- Hey.
- Hey.

866
00:49:30,628 --> 00:49:32,186
I've been trying to call you.

867
00:49:32,396 --> 00:49:34,660
You know what, I got really busy
with some stuff.

868
00:49:34,866 --> 00:49:36,857
You're avoiding me, right?

869
00:49:37,335 --> 00:49:39,769
- No.
- I can explain.

870
00:49:39,971 --> 00:49:42,531
Look, this isn't making
any sense to me, okay?

871
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,435
This girl,
she popped out of nowhere.

872
00:49:44,642 --> 00:49:47,133
Look, what if I had a pimp
who was a friend of mine.

873
00:49:47,345 --> 00:49:49,506
And he's in town for a month or so.

874
00:49:49,714 --> 00:49:52,945
And he needs a place to sleep
so he's on my couch in your bathrobe.

875
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,675
How do you feel about that? Okay?

876
00:49:54,886 --> 00:49:57,252
I mean seriously,
what would you have me think?

877
00:49:57,455 --> 00:50:00,322
- I know it sounds bad...
- We have built cases for death...

878
00:50:00,525 --> 00:50:02,755
...on less than this.
- What do you want me to do?

879
00:50:03,327 --> 00:50:05,625
I just want you to let this go.

880
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:09,061
I just want you to let her go back
to wherever it is she came from.

881
00:50:09,267 --> 00:50:11,701
Josh, this is not our responsibility.

882
00:50:12,436 --> 00:50:14,233
- Look, I gotta go.
- Okay.

883
00:50:14,438 --> 00:50:16,929
- Can we finish this later?
- All right. I'll call you.

884
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:18,938
- Okay.
- All right.

885
00:50:19,143 --> 00:50:21,168
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's going on, man?

886
00:50:21,379 --> 00:50:23,574
- Nothing. You...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

887
00:50:23,781 --> 00:50:25,715
- We don't have to talk about it.
- Please.

888
00:50:25,917 --> 00:50:29,114
I may have found a possible lead
for a brother of hers.

889
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,582
- Really?
- Yeah.

890
00:50:30,788 --> 00:50:32,813
- Thank you, man.
- It's all good, bro.

891
00:50:33,024 --> 00:50:34,286
- Yeah.
- It's what I do.

892
00:50:34,492 --> 00:50:36,892
You know, it's funny,
they really don't get along.

893
00:50:54,645 --> 00:50:56,772
It says here that you went to college.

894
00:50:56,981 --> 00:50:59,211
Yeah, I did two years.

895
00:50:59,717 --> 00:51:01,412
What happened?

896
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:02,847
I ain't finished.

897
00:51:03,054 --> 00:51:04,817
I see.

898
00:51:08,893 --> 00:51:11,919
There are some blanks here
that you didn't fill out.

899
00:51:12,129 --> 00:51:14,324
I don't know the answer.
What you want me do?

900
00:51:14,532 --> 00:51:16,193
Looking at this application...

901
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,631
...tells me that you don't
finish anything.

902
00:51:19,837 --> 00:51:21,304
So why should we hire you?

903
00:51:21,505 --> 00:51:23,302
Listen, man, I just need a job.

904
00:51:23,507 --> 00:51:25,998
You're gonna give me one or not?
It's really simple.

905
00:51:33,484 --> 00:51:35,281
How bad do you want it?

906
00:51:54,138 --> 00:51:57,369
I won't ask you to do anything
you haven't done a million times.

907
00:51:57,575 --> 00:51:59,702
I've seen your record.

908
00:52:10,254 --> 00:52:14,156
- What happened?
- Your Christian help ain't so Christian.

909
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:21,089
This is what your A-word get.

910
00:52:21,299 --> 00:52:23,392
You're supposed to help these girls.

911
00:52:23,601 --> 00:52:26,035
You know how you set her back?

912
00:52:26,237 --> 00:52:28,330
Dear Jesus.

913
00:52:32,009 --> 00:52:36,070
I don't know where the hell Cora is at.
I told her I need to go to the store.

914
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,180
People always told me
I can't be driving.

915
00:52:38,382 --> 00:52:42,113
- She knows I need to go to the store.
- That child's gonna leave you to starve.

916
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,584
I told you,
that the way you were treating her...

917
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:47,451
...she's gonna leave you
to starve to death one day.

918
00:52:47,658 --> 00:52:49,990
- And now this time...
- Shut up, bastard.

919
00:52:51,262 --> 00:52:52,889
Oh, no. Hello.

920
00:52:53,097 --> 00:52:55,327
- Cora.
- <i>Yeah, hello, Madea. Yeah.</i>

921
00:52:55,533 --> 00:52:57,023
- Cora.
- <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

922
00:52:57,234 --> 00:52:59,532
Where the hell you at?

923
00:52:59,837 --> 00:53:01,429
I'm still at the hair salon.

924
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:04,267
What the hell are you doing?
You've been there five hours.

925
00:53:04,475 --> 00:53:07,376
Your hair ain't an inch and a half long.
What are they doing?

926
00:53:07,578 --> 00:53:10,638
I'm coming. I'm just trying to...
Can I have some me time, please?

927
00:53:13,985 --> 00:53:16,419
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

928
00:53:17,021 --> 00:53:20,115
- You need some what?
- <i>Some me time.</i>

929
00:53:20,891 --> 00:53:22,358
Some what?

930
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,620
<i>Some me time. Some time for myself.</i>

931
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:27,158
- Cora.
- Yes, ma'am.

932
00:53:27,365 --> 00:53:30,198
- Did I ever ask you for some me time?
- <i>No, ma'am.</i>

933
00:53:30,401 --> 00:53:32,926
Did I ask you for some me time
when I had to get up...

934
00:53:33,137 --> 00:53:35,071
...every four hours
and cook for you...

935
00:53:35,272 --> 00:53:37,570
...until you were 17 years old?
- <i>No.</i>

936
00:53:37,775 --> 00:53:41,040
Did I ask you for some me time
when I had to hit that stripper pole...

937
00:53:41,245 --> 00:53:43,839
...every night trying to bring money
into this house?

938
00:53:44,048 --> 00:53:46,380
- Did I ask you for some me time then?
- <i>No, ma'am.</i>

939
00:53:46,584 --> 00:53:50,247
Old men up there trying to make it
drizzle, they sure couldn't make it rain.

940
00:53:50,454 --> 00:53:53,116
- What the hell is me time?
- <i>I'm just taking care of myself.</i>

941
00:53:53,324 --> 00:53:55,258
- <i>Getting some me time.</i>
- Time for nothing.

942
00:53:55,459 --> 00:53:56,483
I'm going to the store.

943
00:53:56,694 --> 00:54:00,653
- I'm a grown woman. I'll go myself.
- <i>You can't go to the store.</i>

944
00:54:00,865 --> 00:54:03,095
You're not supposed to drive.
I'll be there soon.

945
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,495
Who the hell are you
to tell me I can't drive.

946
00:54:05,703 --> 00:54:08,399
- If I feel like driving, I'm driving.
- <i>You can't drive...</i>

947
00:54:08,606 --> 00:54:09,766
Shut the hell up.

948
00:54:09,974 --> 00:54:13,034
You get in that car, you're going down.
I'm not playing around.

949
00:54:13,244 --> 00:54:15,906
You're going down, you understand?

950
00:54:16,647 --> 00:54:18,945
I'll be glad when you go down.

951
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:21,414
Down to the graveyard
and become some maggot food.

952
00:54:21,619 --> 00:54:23,314
I'm hungry. What I'm supposed to do?

953
00:54:23,521 --> 00:54:24,681
Just sit up in this house?

954
00:54:24,889 --> 00:54:26,516
You can miss a few meals.

955
00:54:26,724 --> 00:54:27,782
One or two.

956
00:54:28,459 --> 00:54:29,892
Three or seven.

957
00:54:30,895 --> 00:54:32,760
Nine or eleven.

958
00:54:33,564 --> 00:54:36,089
Keep it up, Joe. Keep it up.

959
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,360
Oh, them people called.
You ain't gotta worry about no food.

960
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:41,697
You can call them,
they'll bring it down here.

961
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:45,839
What are you talking about?
Stop smoking that weed.

962
00:54:46,043 --> 00:54:48,136
What the hell you talking about?
You're crazy.

963
00:54:48,345 --> 00:54:50,506
They said they'd give you
three meals a day...

964
00:54:50,714 --> 00:54:54,582
...and they'll give you a percentage on
the people who come through and pay.

965
00:54:54,785 --> 00:54:57,583
- Where they feed you that much?
- One of the whales died.

966
00:54:57,788 --> 00:55:00,086
They need another whale
at the aquarium.

967
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:03,055
Go on down there
and swim around for them.

968
00:55:03,928 --> 00:55:05,520
You rusty old bastard.

969
00:55:05,729 --> 00:55:08,197
You fart and dust come out. Go to hell.

970
00:55:08,399 --> 00:55:10,230
Dead man walking.

971
00:55:10,434 --> 00:55:12,868
Walking the green mile,
getting her out for Jesus.

972
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:16,801
I'm gonna walk the green mile
getting right for Jesus.

973
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:28,318
I don't know what you're blowing at,
but keep blowing.

974
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:30,885
Come on, grandma!

975
00:55:35,392 --> 00:55:37,360
You coming...? You coming out?

976
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:39,654
Hey. You coming out?

977
00:55:39,864 --> 00:55:42,765
- Move it, lady!
- I guess you ain't coming out.

978
00:55:48,939 --> 00:55:51,100
I like them shoes.

979
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:55,138
Come on, come on, come on!

980
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:00,373
Here's a spot here. I got the groceries,
now I just need to get up in here.

981
00:56:00,584 --> 00:56:02,347
Come on out.

982
00:56:13,164 --> 00:56:17,794
I know... Did she...?
I know damn well that you just...

983
00:56:18,002 --> 00:56:19,060
Excuse me.

984
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:20,965
Excuse me.

985
00:56:21,172 --> 00:56:24,801
Lady, I know damn well you saw me
getting ready to take this spot.

986
00:56:25,809 --> 00:56:27,106
I saw you.

987
00:56:27,311 --> 00:56:28,300
I took it.

988
00:56:28,512 --> 00:56:31,310
Why don't you move your little car
before I move it for you?

989
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:35,348
Okay, go on in the store.

990
00:56:35,819 --> 00:56:39,516
Go on in the store. Just walk off. Just
walk off like you bad. You bad. Okay.

991
00:56:41,992 --> 00:56:46,588
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I said I was waiting for that spot, lady.

992
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:49,264
Well, it's my spot now, grandma.

993
00:56:49,466 --> 00:56:52,264
Lady. Lady, look here...
Lady. Lady, let me explain some...

994
00:56:52,469 --> 00:56:56,565
- You gonna follow me into the store?
- Lady, let me explain something to you.

995
00:56:56,774 --> 00:56:58,708
Lord, have mercy.
Lord, have mercy.

996
00:56:58,909 --> 00:57:02,902
She's gonna make me
tear the K and the B off of this Kmart.

997
00:57:03,113 --> 00:57:04,341
I'm gonna back up.

998
00:57:04,548 --> 00:57:08,541
I ought to run into her, Lord help me.
I don't wanna get in no trouble, Lord.

999
00:57:08,752 --> 00:57:10,242
Help me, Jesus.

1000
00:57:10,454 --> 00:57:14,288
Help me, Lord. You know I'm ready
to go drive straight through this glass.

1001
00:57:14,491 --> 00:57:16,550
That's right. I'm gonna beat her ass.

1002
00:57:25,703 --> 00:57:30,868
<i>Attention, Kmart shoppers.</i>
<i>We have a manager's special...</i>

1003
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:49,051
No!

1004
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,852
Are you insane?

1005
00:57:51,528 --> 00:57:53,223
Didn't I tell you that was my spot...

1006
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:56,831
...and you gonna jump in front of me
and take my damn parking spot?

1007
00:57:57,034 --> 00:57:59,400
Are you insane? Put my car down!

1008
00:57:59,603 --> 00:58:05,235
- Okay, I'm gonna put it down for you.
- Old woman, put my car down now!

1009
00:58:05,442 --> 00:58:06,875
Okay.

1010
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:22,120
My husband is a police officer.

1011
00:58:22,326 --> 00:58:24,851
And he is on his way right now.

1012
00:58:25,062 --> 00:58:28,930
I ain't scared of no po-po.
Call the po-po. Call the po-po.

1013
00:58:30,834 --> 00:58:37,797
Honey, this woman, this Jemima
the Hutt, she ruined my car!

1014
00:58:38,008 --> 00:58:40,203
I'll get the hell out of here.
If he wants me...

1015
00:58:40,411 --> 00:58:43,244
...he better come to my house
to get me.

1016
00:58:43,447 --> 00:58:45,608
He will!

1017
00:58:45,816 --> 00:58:47,215
Get over here now!

1018
00:58:47,418 --> 00:58:48,908
The Kmart!

1019
00:58:52,189 --> 00:58:54,020
Am I forgiven?

1020
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:56,350
After those flowers
and those chocolates?

1021
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,927
- Yes.
- And that great movie that we saw?

1022
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:02,064
You are definitely working on it.

1023
00:59:02,266 --> 00:59:04,996
That's good. Because I do not like it
when you're mad at me.

1024
00:59:05,202 --> 00:59:07,796
Well, I don't like being mad at you.

1025
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,429
Oh, boy.

1026
00:59:10,641 --> 00:59:12,802
- Why don't we go inside and make up?
- Let's go.

1027
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:14,671
Okay.

1028
00:59:27,124 --> 00:59:30,321
- Don't touch me.
- Candy, it's me. It's Josh.

1029
00:59:30,527 --> 00:59:31,721
- Josh.
- Yeah.

1030
00:59:31,929 --> 00:59:34,261
She's probably strung out
on something.

1031
00:59:34,465 --> 00:59:36,558
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1032
00:59:36,767 --> 00:59:41,136
- I'm sorry.
- You ain't gotta be sorry. All right?

1033
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:44,530
- Okay, rest, rest.
- Just try to relax.

1034
00:59:44,742 --> 00:59:47,506
I promise. I'm trying. I'm trying.

1035
00:59:48,178 --> 00:59:49,270
Rest, rest.

1036
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:52,108
You have never done that for me.

1037
00:59:57,354 --> 00:59:59,219
What are you talking about, Linda?

1038
00:59:59,423 --> 01:00:00,685
This.

1039
01:00:00,891 --> 01:00:02,859
The care that you're showing her.

1040
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,028
You've never done that for me.

1041
01:00:07,865 --> 01:00:10,561
Baby, please, not tonight.

1042
01:00:11,101 --> 01:00:12,398
Okay?

1043
01:00:12,603 --> 01:00:14,571
Josh, you're in love with her.

1044
01:00:14,772 --> 01:00:17,935
What are you talking about?
I'm just trying to help out a friend.

1045
01:00:18,142 --> 01:00:21,634
I don't even know how to compete
with a drug-addicted prostitute.

1046
01:00:21,845 --> 01:00:24,279
Linda, there is nothing
going on with us.

1047
01:00:24,481 --> 01:00:26,972
I have to go right now.
I can't do this.

1048
01:00:27,184 --> 01:00:29,152
- I can't do this. No.
- Where are you going?

1049
01:00:29,353 --> 01:00:31,844
- I can't do this.
- Linda.

1050
01:00:34,858 --> 01:00:37,918
Please, come and lay with me, please.

1051
01:00:38,328 --> 01:00:39,761
Look, Candy.

1052
01:00:40,964 --> 01:00:43,558
I don't think that would be
a good idea, you know?

1053
01:00:43,767 --> 01:00:46,327
I don't mean like that.
Remember when we were little...

1054
01:00:46,537 --> 01:00:51,270
...and my stepdad would be trying
to get me, he knew you'd protect me.

1055
01:00:51,475 --> 01:00:53,534
Please, Josh, please.

1056
01:00:53,744 --> 01:00:56,235
Josh, please. Josh.

1057
01:01:08,325 --> 01:01:09,815
All right.

1058
01:01:10,761 --> 01:01:12,058
All right.

1059
01:01:14,231 --> 01:01:15,858
Okay.

1060
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,991
It's gonna be okay.

1061
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:22,538
<i>This is the DeKalb County</i>
<i>SWAT Team.</i>

1062
01:01:22,739 --> 01:01:26,038
<i>Put your hands in the air</i>
<i>and walk backwards.</i>

1063
01:01:26,243 --> 01:01:28,006
<i>These are your Miranda rights.</i>

1064
01:01:28,212 --> 01:01:30,077
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>

1065
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,771
<i>If you give up</i>
<i>the right to remain silent...</i>

1066
01:01:32,983 --> 01:01:36,749
<i>... anything you say can and will be</i>
<i>used against you in a court of law.</i>

1067
01:01:36,954 --> 01:01:39,980
<i>You have the right to an attorney</i>
<i>and have an attorney present...</i>

1068
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:42,715
- Don't move!
- I ain't going down without a fight.

1069
01:01:42,926 --> 01:01:46,657
- What you gonna do? Come on.
- You have the right to remain...

1070
01:01:48,765 --> 01:01:52,030
Don't... Put me down.
You're giving me a mammogram.

1071
01:02:12,689 --> 01:02:14,316
Candace.

1072
01:02:16,627 --> 01:02:18,686
Cand... Candy.

1073
01:02:37,381 --> 01:02:38,973
Good morning.

1074
01:02:39,449 --> 01:02:41,974
- You scared me.
- What are you doing here so early?

1075
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:45,215
I am preparing for court.

1076
01:02:45,422 --> 01:02:48,084
You are preparing for court, huh?

1077
01:02:49,259 --> 01:02:51,124
This is the...

1078
01:02:51,461 --> 01:02:53,190
...Candace Collin's, Sarah Lester?

1079
01:02:53,397 --> 01:02:56,696
Wait, hold on, hold on.
I remember this one.

1080
01:02:57,067 --> 01:02:58,466
This is Sarah Lester.

1081
01:02:59,536 --> 01:03:01,970
Yeah, Sarah... Sarah Lester.

1082
01:03:02,172 --> 01:03:04,037
This case was closed
a couple years ago.

1083
01:03:07,811 --> 01:03:10,473
Are you padding this woman's file
with a closed case?

1084
01:03:10,681 --> 01:03:13,377
- Chuck, let me handle this, all right?
- You can't do that.

1085
01:03:13,584 --> 01:03:14,710
It's done.

1086
01:03:14,918 --> 01:03:19,014
So wait, wait, wait. Is this how you've
been winning all your cases, huh?

1087
01:03:19,222 --> 01:03:21,850
Is this how you've been
winning all your cases, Linda?

1088
01:03:22,459 --> 01:03:24,393
I'm not gonna stand by
and let you do this.

1089
01:03:24,595 --> 01:03:25,653
- I gotta...
- What?

1090
01:03:25,862 --> 01:03:27,762
What do you have to do?

1091
01:03:28,098 --> 01:03:30,566
Don't you forget
your bar exam, baby.

1092
01:03:30,767 --> 01:03:32,997
You remember how you cheated?

1093
01:03:34,037 --> 01:03:35,902
Don't try me, Chuck.

1094
01:03:36,106 --> 01:03:37,835
I have the proof.

1095
01:03:38,041 --> 01:03:39,702
And I will use it.

1096
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,345
Why are you doing this?

1097
01:03:45,716 --> 01:03:48,207
I mean,
this woman has done nothing to you.

1098
01:03:48,418 --> 01:03:50,249
How would you know that?

1099
01:03:54,257 --> 01:03:56,452
He's not in love with her.

1100
01:03:57,127 --> 01:03:58,685
He loves you.

1101
01:03:59,363 --> 01:04:02,298
How deep is your commitment
to this girl, Josh?

1102
01:04:02,699 --> 01:04:04,690
You know, she's a friend.

1103
01:04:05,569 --> 01:04:07,161
A friend?

1104
01:04:09,973 --> 01:04:11,804
You know what a binge addict is?

1105
01:04:12,976 --> 01:04:13,965
No.

1106
01:04:14,177 --> 01:04:17,408
They could stay clean
for long periods of time.

1107
01:04:17,648 --> 01:04:23,712
Then something sets them off and they
can go off for days, weeks and binge.

1108
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,150
Because this doesn't just go away
like a cold.

1109
01:04:26,356 --> 01:04:28,916
This is a disease that has to be cured.

1110
01:04:29,559 --> 01:04:34,792
And if you're in it for the wrong reasons
it's gonna destroy you so fast.

1111
01:04:38,035 --> 01:04:42,301
I'm gonna ask you again. How deep
is your commitment to this girl, Josh?

1112
01:04:52,015 --> 01:04:53,642
When we were...

1113
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:56,080
We were both back in college...

1114
01:04:56,286 --> 01:04:57,844
...she...

1115
01:04:58,221 --> 01:05:02,658
I was the only person
that she knew at the school.

1116
01:05:02,859 --> 01:05:04,827
And I knew her
from the neighborhood.

1117
01:05:05,028 --> 01:05:08,361
You know, the other students,
they really used to make fun of her.

1118
01:05:08,565 --> 01:05:11,466
You know, like her hair
and her clothes.

1119
01:05:11,668 --> 01:05:14,000
I started getting embarrassed.

1120
01:05:14,538 --> 01:05:17,530
And they...

1121
01:05:19,576 --> 01:05:21,009
I started avoiding her.

1122
01:05:21,211 --> 01:05:25,011
When I was on the football team
we were having this, like, big party.

1123
01:05:25,382 --> 01:05:26,872
And...

1124
01:05:27,417 --> 01:05:29,248
...they told me...

1125
01:05:29,453 --> 01:05:32,149
...to invite Candy over, you know,
so I did.

1126
01:05:32,355 --> 01:05:34,380
I had a date. I really didn't wanna...

1127
01:05:35,325 --> 01:05:38,317
I really didn't wanna be there.
They told me that they would...

1128
01:05:38,528 --> 01:05:42,521
...you know, like,
keep her company while I was gone...

1129
01:05:43,467 --> 01:05:45,628
...and I came back that night.

1130
01:05:47,137 --> 01:05:48,229
And...

1131
01:05:58,248 --> 01:06:00,011
I came back...

1132
01:06:00,217 --> 01:06:02,515
I came back that night.

1133
01:06:06,156 --> 01:06:08,454
I came back that night.

1134
01:06:09,025 --> 01:06:11,084
And I went in my room.

1135
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:14,761
And...

1136
01:06:22,472 --> 01:06:24,440
...they raped her.

1137
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:26,941
They raped her.

1138
01:06:27,144 --> 01:06:28,338
And I didn't do...

1139
01:06:28,545 --> 01:06:31,173
I didn't do nothing about it.

1140
01:06:31,882 --> 01:06:34,476
I didn't do nothing about it. I'm like...

1141
01:06:34,684 --> 01:06:36,948
...you know, I'm like... What?

1142
01:06:37,154 --> 01:06:39,850
What? Candy, I'm sorry.

1143
01:06:40,056 --> 01:06:42,183
I never told her I'm sorry.

1144
01:06:42,392 --> 01:06:43,916
Josh, look at me, Josh.

1145
01:06:44,361 --> 01:06:46,295
You can't carry that weight.

1146
01:06:46,496 --> 01:06:48,930
- Why did I...? Oh, God, I had to go.
- You... Josh...

1147
01:06:49,566 --> 01:06:50,794
...look at me.

1148
01:06:51,334 --> 01:06:53,393
- Josh, look at me, please.
- Yes, I get it.

1149
01:06:53,603 --> 01:06:55,696
- Yeah, I'm trying.
- Look at me. Look at me.

1150
01:06:55,906 --> 01:06:58,807
- You can't carry that weight.
- Okay.

1151
01:06:59,376 --> 01:07:02,277
She had problems
long before that party.

1152
01:07:06,316 --> 01:07:07,408
- Mabel.
- Brown.

1153
01:07:07,617 --> 01:07:09,847
Listen,
I'm trying to see Judge Mablean.

1154
01:07:10,053 --> 01:07:12,681
- Will you please be quiet.
- I'm trying to pray for you.

1155
01:07:12,889 --> 01:07:15,983
God don't like you.
He grew you in a Petri dish, Brown.

1156
01:07:16,193 --> 01:07:18,889
- I'm trying to help you.
- I don't need you to help me here.

1157
01:07:19,095 --> 01:07:20,756
Hey, hey, Brian, hey.

1158
01:07:21,097 --> 01:07:23,827
Judge Mablean
always give me a slap on the wrist.

1159
01:07:24,034 --> 01:07:26,400
This is not Judge Mablean.
This judge is tough.

1160
01:07:26,603 --> 01:07:28,969
- How tough could he be?
- All rise. The honorable...

1161
01:07:29,172 --> 01:07:31,299
...Judge Mathis presiding.

1162
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:36,078
You may be seated. First case...

1163
01:07:36,279 --> 01:07:39,305
...DeKalb County
calls Mabel Simmons.

1164
01:07:39,516 --> 01:07:40,540
Wait a minute.

1165
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:42,718
- Is that who the hell I think it is?
- Yes.

1166
01:07:42,919 --> 01:07:48,084
- It's all spelled out there, Your Honor.
- Yeah, I'm looking at this case.

1167
01:07:48,658 --> 01:07:51,183
And your record is ridiculous,
ma'am.

1168
01:07:51,394 --> 01:07:54,022
I don't even know
how you still on the street.

1169
01:07:54,231 --> 01:07:55,926
- Your Honor, the reaso...
- I'm talking.

1170
01:07:56,633 --> 01:07:59,932
You should have been locked up
a long time ago with this.

1171
01:08:00,136 --> 01:08:01,865
- Your Honor...
- Look, I speak...

1172
01:08:02,305 --> 01:08:03,431
...you listen.

1173
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,438
And then I will allow you to respond,
you understand?

1174
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:07,934
Yes, sir.

1175
01:08:08,144 --> 01:08:10,635
Don't you go there, he talking.
Y'all better get it.

1176
01:08:10,847 --> 01:08:12,109
- Mabel, be quiet.
- Madea.

1177
01:08:12,315 --> 01:08:13,441
Better be quiet.

1178
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:16,676
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- Now it's my turn to talk?

1179
01:08:16,887 --> 01:08:21,290
You've heard the saying, "Speak when
you're spoken to or otherwise shut up."

1180
01:08:21,491 --> 01:08:23,516
It's time to say it.
That's how this go, huh?

1181
01:08:23,727 --> 01:08:25,058
I don't have time for this.

1182
01:08:25,262 --> 01:08:29,699
It's time for some sentencing. Bailiff,
what time you have on your watch?

1183
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,197
Five to 10, judge.

1184
01:08:31,401 --> 01:08:33,528
Five to ten, that's your sentence.

1185
01:08:33,737 --> 01:08:35,295
- Have a good day.
- Oh, hell, no.

1186
01:08:35,505 --> 01:08:38,770
You gonna give me five years?
You ain't gonna take me back to jail...

1187
01:08:38,975 --> 01:08:41,205
Come here, what you gonna do?
What the hell are...?

1188
01:08:45,448 --> 01:08:47,973
Gonna take me out of here.
I ain't going. I ain't going.

1189
01:08:48,184 --> 01:08:49,583
I ain't going. I ain't going.

1190
01:08:49,786 --> 01:08:51,686
I ain't going. I...

1191
01:09:05,201 --> 01:09:06,429
Linda.

1192
01:09:06,636 --> 01:09:08,695
- Oh, hey, baby.
- Hey.

1193
01:09:10,073 --> 01:09:12,940
- Thanks for letting me borrow this.
- Oh, sure.

1194
01:09:13,243 --> 01:09:14,403
How'd it go today?

1195
01:09:14,844 --> 01:09:16,209
- Seventeen years.
- What?

1196
01:09:16,413 --> 01:09:18,506
Seventeen years?
Baby, it was only two counts.

1197
01:09:18,715 --> 01:09:20,649
Sweetie, you didn't see
her New York sheet.

1198
01:09:20,850 --> 01:09:22,750
It is as long as my arm.

1199
01:09:23,153 --> 01:09:25,280
- Wow, I had no idea she...
- I know, I know.

1200
01:09:25,488 --> 01:09:27,979
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I really tried...

1201
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:30,659
...to be lenient with her.

1202
01:09:30,961 --> 01:09:33,725
But, you know,
once the judge saw the charges...

1203
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:36,558
...and on top of that,
she didn't show up today.

1204
01:09:37,701 --> 01:09:39,430
You know, maybe it's for the best.

1205
01:09:39,636 --> 01:09:42,127
Maybe now
she can get her life together.

1206
01:09:43,506 --> 01:09:45,371
Maybe you're right.

1207
01:09:46,309 --> 01:09:49,403
So she's still at your place?

1208
01:09:49,612 --> 01:09:51,603
No, she left.

1209
01:09:51,815 --> 01:09:53,806
Maybe now, I can...

1210
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:57,451
...stop being mad at you and we can
go back to planning our future?

1211
01:09:57,654 --> 01:09:59,246
I would like that.

1212
01:09:59,756 --> 01:10:01,223
Me too.

1213
01:10:03,259 --> 01:10:05,489
- All right.
- Okay.

1214
01:10:31,988 --> 01:10:33,853
Hey, sweet thing.

1215
01:10:35,425 --> 01:10:36,949
What you looking for?

1216
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,991
A good time.

1217
01:10:39,195 --> 01:10:41,129
What's it going to cost me?

1218
01:10:41,331 --> 01:10:44,300
I'll give you a special, $50.

1219
01:10:44,534 --> 01:10:46,058
Get in.

1220
01:10:51,775 --> 01:10:53,572
Where are you going?
Do you wanna party?

1221
01:10:53,777 --> 01:10:55,836
You need a date?

1222
01:10:56,046 --> 01:10:57,411
Hey.

1223
01:10:57,614 --> 01:10:59,081
Come on.

1224
01:12:15,024 --> 01:12:17,390
Put your damn hands off me.
Put your hands off me.

1225
01:12:17,594 --> 01:12:21,496
I'm telling y'all, ain't nobody... I ain't
scared of none of you. I ain't scared.

1226
01:12:21,698 --> 01:12:25,361
Yeah, keep it up. Keep it up.
I ain't scared of none of you.

1227
01:12:30,507 --> 01:12:32,771
I'm here, now let me go.

1228
01:12:33,209 --> 01:12:34,767
What the hell wrong with you?

1229
01:12:35,311 --> 01:12:36,972
How you doing?

1230
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,175
Guess this is my cell.

1231
01:12:39,382 --> 01:12:42,545
What the hell you smiling for?
You the Martha Stewart of prison?

1232
01:12:42,752 --> 01:12:43,980
No.

1233
01:12:44,187 --> 01:12:45,779
I'm T.T.

1234
01:12:45,989 --> 01:12:47,718
- You're who?
- I'm T.T.

1235
01:12:48,258 --> 01:12:51,489
- Like two of these?
- I'm T.T.

1236
01:12:52,462 --> 01:12:54,589
Oh, T.T. T.T., how are you doing?

1237
01:12:54,797 --> 01:12:57,630
I'm Mabel,
but everybody call me Madea. Hello.

1238
01:12:58,134 --> 01:13:00,830
I'm so happy that we're sharing a cell.

1239
01:13:01,104 --> 01:13:04,164
This is your bunk. I made it for you.

1240
01:13:04,374 --> 01:13:06,069
Oh, thank you and I appreciate it.

1241
01:13:06,276 --> 01:13:08,540
I ain't into that.
Because you making a bunk...

1242
01:13:08,745 --> 01:13:12,306
...don't mean I'm giving you nothing.
You ain't getting none of this stuff.

1243
01:13:12,515 --> 01:13:14,915
Put your hands on me I'll punch
that Spanish out.

1244
01:13:15,118 --> 01:13:17,518
You gonna be talking
straight up English.

1245
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,880
You're so funny.

1246
01:13:19,088 --> 01:13:20,851
I was just being nice.

1247
01:13:21,057 --> 01:13:23,355
When I saw you come in, I thought:

1248
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:26,792
"I hope she's in my cell."

1249
01:13:29,632 --> 01:13:32,999
Brownies for my brownie?

1250
01:13:33,203 --> 01:13:34,500
I made them myself.

1251
01:13:34,704 --> 01:13:37,901
"Brownies for your brownie?" You
trying to call me black or something?

1252
01:13:38,107 --> 01:13:39,096
Brownie.

1253
01:13:39,309 --> 01:13:42,005
Ain't no oven in here.
How the hell you make a brownie?

1254
01:13:42,378 --> 01:13:44,676
I have my ways.

1255
01:13:45,148 --> 01:13:46,206
No, thank you.

1256
01:13:48,051 --> 01:13:51,452
I saw you on TV.
That was a great chase.

1257
01:13:51,654 --> 01:13:53,383
How long you have here, my dear?

1258
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:55,319
They tell me I got five years.

1259
01:13:55,525 --> 01:13:57,686
But I'm breaking
out of here first chance I get.

1260
01:13:58,328 --> 01:14:00,626
Can I come with you?

1261
01:14:03,433 --> 01:14:06,402
You seem like a nice, sweet person
The hell you in here for?

1262
01:14:06,603 --> 01:14:09,401
Stealing flowers? What you do?
Steal candy from Girl Scouts?

1263
01:14:09,606 --> 01:14:10,971
What, what?

1264
01:14:12,775 --> 01:14:14,242
No.

1265
01:14:14,444 --> 01:14:16,674
I murdered 18 men.

1266
01:14:16,879 --> 01:14:19,905
- I'm the...
- I'm sorry, you what to 18?

1267
01:14:20,116 --> 01:14:22,983
I murder 18 men.

1268
01:14:23,486 --> 01:14:25,716
- Eighty?
- Eighteen.

1269
01:14:25,922 --> 01:14:28,652
One-eight men.

1270
01:14:32,262 --> 01:14:36,096
I'm one of the first female serial killers.

1271
01:14:36,299 --> 01:14:39,462
I'm going to be here till I... die.

1272
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:44,702
But I'll be making you brownies,
my brownie.

1273
01:14:55,385 --> 01:14:57,080
Hey, which one is yours?

1274
01:14:57,287 --> 01:14:59,517
Oh, you can take either one.

1275
01:15:00,156 --> 01:15:01,680
Donna?

1276
01:15:03,126 --> 01:15:04,718
Candy? Oh, my God.

1277
01:15:04,927 --> 01:15:06,690
Candy.

1278
01:15:07,563 --> 01:15:09,121
- How are you doing?
- Oh, my God.

1279
01:15:09,332 --> 01:15:10,492
I am so glad to see you.

1280
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:12,861
- I know.
- I didn't know what happened to you.

1281
01:15:13,069 --> 01:15:16,095
I've been trying to reach you
but you ain't got no address.

1282
01:15:19,842 --> 01:15:21,036
You look good.

1283
01:15:21,244 --> 01:15:23,769
Yeah, I'm doing good.
How are you doing?

1284
01:15:26,649 --> 01:15:29,914
- What?
- They gave me 17 years.

1285
01:15:30,219 --> 01:15:32,653
- For...? For what?
- Donna...

1286
01:15:32,855 --> 01:15:34,413
...I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1287
01:15:34,791 --> 01:15:38,158
No, that ain't right.
They had to trump your charges.

1288
01:15:38,361 --> 01:15:41,797
I don't know what happened.
I just know this ain't right.

1289
01:15:42,165 --> 01:15:43,757
Donna.

1290
01:15:44,734 --> 01:15:46,929
What am I gonna do
for 17 years in here?

1291
01:15:47,303 --> 01:15:50,238
I've been going to Ellen's services.
No, wait, wait, wait.

1292
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,670
She teaches classes here.
You should go.

1293
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:54,433
I ain't trying to be in no church.

1294
01:15:54,644 --> 01:15:56,839
It's not like that.
She teaches a group session.

1295
01:15:57,046 --> 01:15:59,173
And she is really good.

1296
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:02,311
I mean, she preaches
but not like a preacher, you know.

1297
01:16:02,518 --> 01:16:04,884
She makes it clear
so you can understand it.

1298
01:16:05,088 --> 01:16:07,147
Look at me,
I've been clean all this time.

1299
01:16:07,357 --> 01:16:09,484
And if you take her course...

1300
01:16:09,692 --> 01:16:12,661
...you get time off your sentence.

1301
01:16:13,029 --> 01:16:14,792
You should come.

1302
01:16:16,466 --> 01:16:18,024
I don't know how people eat this.

1303
01:16:18,234 --> 01:16:22,568
This is crazy. I've seen people
on <i>Survivor</i> eat better food than this.

1304
01:16:26,376 --> 01:16:29,209
Doesn't she realize
she was running for some roaches?

1305
01:16:30,279 --> 01:16:31,507
You're a cute little thing.

1306
01:16:31,714 --> 01:16:33,705
- Get your hands off of me.
- Oh, you feisty.

1307
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:36,510
- Leave her. That's my friend.
- Is anybody talking to you?

1308
01:16:37,053 --> 01:16:38,520
Young man.

1309
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:43,552
This little lady don't wanna be
bothered, now get on up...

1310
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,058
...go on back to where you came from.
Now, go on.

1311
01:16:46,262 --> 01:16:48,196
Who you think you talking to,
old lady?

1312
01:16:52,702 --> 01:16:55,694
You don't know me. I'm gonna
give you the benefit of the doubt.

1313
01:16:55,905 --> 01:16:58,601
Now, get the hell up from the table
and go on now.

1314
01:16:58,808 --> 01:17:00,503
Go on, go on, sir, go on.

1315
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:03,042
I see nobody told you I run this prison.

1316
01:17:03,246 --> 01:17:08,240
I'm Big Sal and what Big Sal wants,
Big Sal gets. Get it?

1317
01:17:08,618 --> 01:17:11,052
I guess nobody told you
that I'm Madea.

1318
01:17:11,254 --> 01:17:14,849
Ma to the damn D, E, A,
you understand that?

1319
01:17:15,057 --> 01:17:18,720
And what I want, I get.
Do you understand me?

1320
01:17:18,928 --> 01:17:19,986
I'm from the west end...

1321
01:17:20,196 --> 01:17:23,427
...where we cut a fool first and
run like hell afterwards, understand?

1322
01:17:23,633 --> 01:17:27,091
You don't know me. You don't know
who the hell you talking to.

1323
01:17:27,303 --> 01:17:30,170
I'm gonna come across this table
and rip out your urethra tube.

1324
01:17:30,773 --> 01:17:32,263
I see I have to break you in.

1325
01:17:32,475 --> 01:17:33,999
You gonna get broke the hell in...

1326
01:17:39,115 --> 01:17:40,878
- We'll have our time.
- Yes, we will.

1327
01:17:41,083 --> 01:17:43,074
I look forward to it.

1328
01:17:43,653 --> 01:17:45,120
A officer and a gentleman.

1329
01:17:46,956 --> 01:17:50,949
Yeah, get the hell on out of here
with Alvin and the two chipmunks.

1330
01:17:51,961 --> 01:17:53,519
- What the hell is that?
- Thank you.

1331
01:17:53,729 --> 01:17:58,063
I wasn't doing nothing for you. I don't
like people messing over nobody.

1332
01:17:59,101 --> 01:18:01,899
I'm Terry but everybody
calls me T.T.

1333
01:18:03,973 --> 01:18:07,306
She say her name's T.T.
I thought she said titty too at first.

1334
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:09,637
I can't understand
what the hell she's saying.

1335
01:18:09,846 --> 01:18:11,871
Yeah, I'm Candace.

1336
01:18:12,081 --> 01:18:14,777
And I'm Donna. Thank you
for sticking up for my friend.

1337
01:18:14,984 --> 01:18:16,076
Yeah, y'all welcome.

1338
01:18:21,491 --> 01:18:23,288
You have a letter.

1339
01:18:28,431 --> 01:18:31,730
- Why won't you talk to him?
- I ain't got nothing to say to him.

1340
01:18:31,934 --> 01:18:34,630
Maybe he can help figure out
why you're in here so long.

1341
01:18:34,837 --> 01:18:36,498
Listen, I don't wanna talk to him.

1342
01:18:36,706 --> 01:18:39,072
Well, obviously
that man wants to be there for you.

1343
01:18:39,275 --> 01:18:41,641
So why don't you let...
Why don't you just see him?

1344
01:18:41,844 --> 01:18:43,835
Why don't you just drop it?

1345
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,914
Drop it. Yeah, all right.

1346
01:18:49,919 --> 01:18:51,648
They ain't gonna give me five years...

1347
01:18:51,854 --> 01:18:54,254
...Judge Mathis,
I don't care if it's Judge Judy.

1348
01:18:54,457 --> 01:18:56,482
You ain't gonna give me no five years.

1349
01:18:56,692 --> 01:18:59,718
But they did. But I've been
looking for a way to break out of here.

1350
01:18:59,929 --> 01:19:01,988
You folks don't know me.
I will set it all up.

1351
01:19:02,198 --> 01:19:03,426
Hi, sweetness.

1352
01:19:07,169 --> 01:19:08,363
You looking good.

1353
01:19:08,738 --> 01:19:11,502
I know you ain't talking to me.
She must be talking to you.

1354
01:19:11,707 --> 01:19:15,143
I'm ain't gonna let her
take my virginity.

1355
01:19:16,212 --> 01:19:17,975
- What's so funny?
- You funny.

1356
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:20,774
You funny as hell
looking like Lou Ferrigno.

1357
01:19:21,684 --> 01:19:23,515
Old lady,
you know who you're talking to.

1358
01:19:23,719 --> 01:19:27,485
Yes, I do. I'm talking to you. You better
back the hell up out my face...

1359
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:30,250
- Well, leave it alone.
- Go ahead on, bruh. Go ahead on.

1360
01:19:30,459 --> 01:19:32,450
Go ahead on.
Y'all tell him, he don't know.

1361
01:19:33,563 --> 01:19:35,360
So when are you coming to see me?

1362
01:19:36,933 --> 01:19:38,867
Young man.

1363
01:19:39,168 --> 01:19:41,830
Didn't this girl tell you
she don't want to be bothered?

1364
01:19:42,038 --> 01:19:45,405
Why the hell do you keep talking
to her? What is wrong with you?

1365
01:19:45,608 --> 01:19:47,132
What you gonna do?

1366
01:19:52,848 --> 01:19:54,179
What you...

1367
01:19:54,383 --> 01:19:56,180
...gonna do?
That's what I wanna know.

1368
01:19:56,385 --> 01:19:59,479
What you gonna do? You gonna
sit there and tell something to me.

1369
01:19:59,689 --> 01:20:02,089
- Would you stop it.
- Say something, say something.

1370
01:20:02,291 --> 01:20:04,452
- I don't hear you.
- I'll get you for this...

1371
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:08,061
...grandma.
- What's going on, big woman?

1372
01:20:08,264 --> 01:20:09,458
Come on, you big papa...

1373
01:20:09,665 --> 01:20:11,030
Come on, up in there.

1374
01:20:11,233 --> 01:20:13,201
Oh, yeah.

1375
01:20:17,206 --> 01:20:18,730
Cover up him.

1376
01:20:19,976 --> 01:20:21,341
What's going on in here?

1377
01:20:22,178 --> 01:20:23,611
We not doing nothing.

1378
01:20:30,553 --> 01:20:33,488
I'm just telling her how good God is.

1379
01:20:36,258 --> 01:20:38,123
All right, today...

1380
01:20:38,327 --> 01:20:40,693
...we are gonna talk about forgiveness.

1381
01:20:40,896 --> 01:20:43,228
Why is this so important? Yes, T.T.

1382
01:20:43,899 --> 01:20:46,663
Because you have to forgive
to be forgiven.

1383
01:20:46,869 --> 01:20:47,858
Correct.

1384
01:20:48,204 --> 01:20:51,367
We must forgive others
as Christ forgave us.

1385
01:20:51,774 --> 01:20:54,538
Last week we talked
about the first steps to forgiveness.

1386
01:20:54,744 --> 01:20:55,972
Anybody know?

1387
01:20:57,346 --> 01:20:59,007
Acknowledging what was done.

1388
01:20:59,215 --> 01:21:00,842
That's right.

1389
01:21:01,484 --> 01:21:04,282
A lot of times we don't wanna
acknowledge what we've done.

1390
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:09,887
When you don't forgive somebody,
you give them power over your life.

1391
01:21:10,092 --> 01:21:12,856
They're sleeping at night
and you're walking around...

1392
01:21:13,062 --> 01:21:15,587
...remembering everything
that they've done.

1393
01:21:15,798 --> 01:21:17,629
You know a little bit of my testimony.

1394
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:21,496
Sixteen years living on the street.
Drug addiction, prostitution.

1395
01:21:21,704 --> 01:21:24,264
And I did it
because I was hurting myself.

1396
01:21:24,473 --> 01:21:27,465
I was hurting my daddy.
I was hurting my mother.

1397
01:21:27,677 --> 01:21:31,306
I was hurting every man
that did anything bad to me.

1398
01:21:31,514 --> 01:21:34,415
Until one day, the Lord spoke to me.

1399
01:21:36,218 --> 01:21:38,152
And he said:

1400
01:21:38,354 --> 01:21:41,790
"Forgiveness
is not for the other person.

1401
01:21:42,291 --> 01:21:43,849
It's for you."

1402
01:21:44,293 --> 01:21:45,783
The longer you hold on to it...

1403
01:21:45,995 --> 01:21:49,522
...the longer you hold on
to the pain and the past and the hurt...

1404
01:21:49,965 --> 01:21:52,365
...the longer you hold yourself back
from being free.

1405
01:21:52,568 --> 01:21:54,593
I can't forgive my dad
for what he did to me.

1406
01:21:54,804 --> 01:21:58,069
- He's the reason I'm in here.
- Well, cookie, don't forgive him.

1407
01:21:58,274 --> 01:22:00,708
Because he's living his life,
you're in here.

1408
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:03,777
Forgiveness is not for them.
It is for you.

1409
01:22:03,979 --> 01:22:06,709
Well, I can't forgive him.
You don't know what he did to me.

1410
01:22:06,916 --> 01:22:09,749
Lord, do I have to listen
to all this melodrama?

1411
01:22:09,985 --> 01:22:11,612
Is something wrong, Ms. Simmons?

1412
01:22:13,756 --> 01:22:14,950
Is there something wrong?

1413
01:22:15,157 --> 01:22:18,524
Sorry, reverend, doctor, bishop,
preacher lady, whatever your name is.

1414
01:22:18,728 --> 01:22:20,286
I don't agree with all of this.

1415
01:22:20,496 --> 01:22:23,556
I hear what you say about forgiveness.
You're supposed to forgive.

1416
01:22:23,766 --> 01:22:25,631
This child is telling
what her daddy did.

1417
01:22:25,835 --> 01:22:29,032
Your dad is somewhere
living his life and you're on lockdown.

1418
01:22:29,238 --> 01:22:31,035
You're in jail
because of what you did.

1419
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:34,767
Learn how to take some responsibility
for yourself. For your own stuff.

1420
01:22:34,977 --> 01:22:38,811
I can't stand folks wanna be the victim.
"This person did this so I'm this way."

1421
01:22:39,014 --> 01:22:40,208
Everybody got a story.

1422
01:22:40,416 --> 01:22:42,008
Your mama and daddy
gave you life.

1423
01:22:42,218 --> 01:22:45,210
That's all they do. No matter
how good, how bad the life was...

1424
01:22:45,421 --> 01:22:49,448
...it's up to you to make something of it.
Suck it up and shut the hell up.

1425
01:22:49,692 --> 01:22:51,819
- But you don't know what he did.
- Let her talk.

1426
01:22:55,598 --> 01:22:57,190
Thank you, Biggie Smalls.

1427
01:22:57,967 --> 01:22:59,696
I love it when you call me
"big papa."

1428
01:23:00,302 --> 01:23:01,769
You're such a gentleman.

1429
01:23:04,306 --> 01:23:06,206
They say I come here,
I get some time off.

1430
01:23:06,408 --> 01:23:08,205
I'm trying to get time off. Do my time.

1431
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:11,504
I don't mess with nobody.
I don't want nobody to mess with me.

1432
01:23:11,714 --> 01:23:15,275
People, all you up in here
need to understand something, okay?

1433
01:23:15,484 --> 01:23:16,712
Everybody got a life.

1434
01:23:16,919 --> 01:23:18,750
What you do with that life is up to you.

1435
01:23:18,954 --> 01:23:20,819
Stop being the victim. That's all I say.

1436
01:23:21,023 --> 01:23:23,423
I don't preach that stuff.
I will leave that to you.

1437
01:23:23,626 --> 01:23:24,957
I don't even wanna be here.

1438
01:23:25,161 --> 01:23:28,494
But I got to get out of here
because this is working on my damn...

1439
01:23:28,697 --> 01:23:31,461
This is working on my nerves.
Sorry, girls, that's what...

1440
01:23:31,667 --> 01:23:33,897
I can't be bothered with this. You...

1441
01:23:34,503 --> 01:23:36,300
Guess she told you.

1442
01:25:07,396 --> 01:25:11,298
I'm glad you decided
to let me come see you.

1443
01:25:12,902 --> 01:25:14,494
Yeah.

1444
01:25:15,771 --> 01:25:17,068
So how are you?

1445
01:25:18,307 --> 01:25:20,207
I'm making it.

1446
01:25:20,709 --> 01:25:24,907
- So you're getting married soon, huh?
- Yeah.

1447
01:25:26,415 --> 01:25:28,042
Congratulations.

1448
01:25:28,584 --> 01:25:30,449
Good luck with that.

1449
01:25:30,753 --> 01:25:32,983
I really don't know what to say.

1450
01:25:33,188 --> 01:25:36,055
I feel like I keep letting you down.

1451
01:25:36,725 --> 01:25:38,556
I've been going to Ellen.

1452
01:25:38,761 --> 01:25:42,356
And I've really been listening
to what she has to say.

1453
01:25:42,564 --> 01:25:45,499
And she says that
if you love the Lord...

1454
01:25:45,701 --> 01:25:49,398
...then everything is gonna work out
for good for you. Do you believe that?

1455
01:25:50,539 --> 01:25:53,064
Yeah. Yeah, I believe that.

1456
01:25:53,275 --> 01:25:55,505
I know I do because...

1457
01:25:55,945 --> 01:25:57,674
Josh, I gotta believe in something.

1458
01:25:58,047 --> 01:25:59,674
You can believe in me.

1459
01:26:00,115 --> 01:26:02,413
I know I wasn't there that night.

1460
01:26:02,618 --> 01:26:05,052
But I guarantee you
that will never happen again.

1461
01:26:09,725 --> 01:26:13,024
Did you know that they were gonna
do that to me that night?

1462
01:26:17,166 --> 01:26:20,795
Did you know that they were gonna
do that to me that night?

1463
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:23,229
No, Candy, I didn't.

1464
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:24,872
Josh, I needed you.

1465
01:26:25,207 --> 01:26:27,368
You weren't there for me.

1466
01:26:27,576 --> 01:26:30,739
You weren't there. I screamed for you.

1467
01:26:32,314 --> 01:26:35,078
And you never came for me.
You left me there.

1468
01:26:35,284 --> 01:26:36,273
Candy.

1469
01:26:36,485 --> 01:26:38,851
You didn't protect me.

1470
01:26:40,155 --> 01:26:41,713
Candy, I'm sorry.

1471
01:26:42,458 --> 01:26:44,653
Please, forgive me.

1472
01:26:46,261 --> 01:26:47,489
Please.

1473
01:26:47,696 --> 01:26:50,324
I was so mad at you, Josh.

1474
01:26:50,532 --> 01:26:52,932
I was so angry for so long.

1475
01:26:55,137 --> 01:26:56,968
But, Josh...

1476
01:26:57,439 --> 01:26:59,464
...I forgive you.

1477
01:27:00,042 --> 01:27:01,805
I forgive you.

1478
01:27:02,011 --> 01:27:04,673
You gotta go on
and you gotta live your life.

1479
01:27:05,547 --> 01:27:07,174
And I gotta live mine.

1480
01:27:07,383 --> 01:27:09,977
I'm not gonna be a victim anymore.

1481
01:27:10,185 --> 01:27:13,621
I gotta change my life for me.
Now you go get married.

1482
01:27:14,089 --> 01:27:15,454
Be happy.

1483
01:27:15,657 --> 01:27:18,125
And I'm gonna try
to do the same thing.

1484
01:27:24,933 --> 01:27:26,161
I gotta go.

1485
01:27:28,037 --> 01:27:30,437
Have a good wedding day.

1486
01:27:45,421 --> 01:27:47,321
Joshua. Joshua.

1487
01:27:47,523 --> 01:27:49,013
Why are you not dressed?

1488
01:27:49,224 --> 01:27:50,486
Get the jacket on.

1489
01:27:50,692 --> 01:27:53,786
Linda's gonna be here, and I'm not
getting cussed out behind you.

1490
01:27:53,996 --> 01:27:56,624
Get your jacket on.
The mayor and the governor are there.

1491
01:27:56,832 --> 01:27:57,992
You gonna make them wait?

1492
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:00,828
You're gonna keep working?
Look at me like I'm stupid?

1493
01:28:01,036 --> 01:28:03,937
- I will be out there. Thank you.
- Thank you, Josh

1494
01:28:04,139 --> 01:28:07,108
- Thanks a lot. Nice. Nice.
- Calm down. I got it. I got it.

1495
01:28:08,444 --> 01:28:10,173
- Josh, what are you doing?
- Hey.

1496
01:28:10,379 --> 01:28:12,176
It's your wedding,
why are you working?

1497
01:28:12,381 --> 01:28:14,349
- Get dressed.
- I'm getting dressed, man.

1498
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:17,144
I'm getting dressed.
Yeah, you're right.

1499
01:28:20,255 --> 01:28:21,313
Hey.

1500
01:28:21,523 --> 01:28:22,922
I was looking at...

1501
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:26,822
I was looking at Candy's file. And...

1502
01:28:29,031 --> 01:28:30,225
Something's not adding up.

1503
01:28:30,699 --> 01:28:33,998
The girl gets 17 years, right?

1504
01:28:34,203 --> 01:28:38,139
And the maximum
on this count is four.

1505
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:47,248
Josh, I gotta tell you something.

1506
01:29:21,617 --> 01:29:23,983
The couple has written
their own vows.

1507
01:29:24,186 --> 01:29:26,051
These vows are from the heart.

1508
01:29:26,255 --> 01:29:29,224
And will bind them together forever.

1509
01:29:30,926 --> 01:29:32,655
Josh.

1510
01:29:32,861 --> 01:29:35,853
You are my heart and soul.

1511
01:29:36,665 --> 01:29:38,963
I thank God for you every day.

1512
01:29:39,168 --> 01:29:42,569
I promise to love you
in sickness and in health.

1513
01:29:44,072 --> 01:29:47,269
I promise to give myself only to you.

1514
01:29:48,043 --> 01:29:51,012
And I promise to be honest...

1515
01:29:51,914 --> 01:29:55,111
...and to love you forever and ever.

1516
01:29:57,519 --> 01:29:58,747
Linda...

1517
01:29:59,321 --> 01:30:03,781
...I will always know
that you are a wonderful woman.

1518
01:30:05,194 --> 01:30:07,628
But you are a conniving...

1519
01:30:07,829 --> 01:30:10,662
...and a manipulating human being...

1520
01:30:10,866 --> 01:30:12,458
...and you disgust me.

1521
01:30:15,737 --> 01:30:16,761
Joshua.

1522
01:30:19,608 --> 01:30:20,802
Ladies and gentlemen.

1523
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:23,678
This beautiful insecure woman...

1524
01:30:23,879 --> 01:30:25,847
...that I refuse to marry...

1525
01:30:26,048 --> 01:30:30,314
...she padded charges
on a case that she handled...

1526
01:30:30,519 --> 01:30:34,683
...sending somebody to jail
for time that they did not deserve.

1527
01:30:45,701 --> 01:30:47,362
Thank you.

1528
01:31:09,458 --> 01:31:12,427
- What are you doing here? You're...
- Hey, Candy, Candy. Come here.

1529
01:31:12,628 --> 01:31:14,220
Come here.

1530
01:31:15,063 --> 01:31:16,052
No touching.

1531
01:31:16,265 --> 01:31:17,425
Shut up, man.

1532
01:31:17,633 --> 01:31:18,827
What are you doing?

1533
01:31:19,034 --> 01:31:20,695
I gotta get you out of here, okay?

1534
01:31:20,902 --> 01:31:23,700
I gotta get you out. Gotta take
you home. You understand me?

1535
01:31:24,139 --> 01:31:26,733
- What are you talking about?
- I'm gonna get you out.

1536
01:31:26,942 --> 01:31:30,207
Linda is the last person in my life
that I'm gonna let hurt you.

1537
01:31:30,412 --> 01:31:31,572
I'm gonna be here for you.

1538
01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:35,113
I'll help you kick that crap
in the streets and all the other stuff...

1539
01:31:35,317 --> 01:31:37,683
...if it takes every breath in my body.
Understand?

1540
01:31:38,954 --> 01:31:40,251
I love you.

1541
01:31:46,228 --> 01:31:47,695
No touching.

1542
01:31:49,164 --> 01:31:50,859
The heck with it.

1543
01:32:08,150 --> 01:32:11,313
<i>It's a public issue because justice</i>
<i>is for everyone. God bless you.</i>

1544
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,987
You're on with Frank and Wanda.

1545
01:32:13,188 --> 01:32:15,520
<i>When I was reviewing</i>
<i>Candace Washington's file...</i>

1546
01:32:15,724 --> 01:32:17,885
<i>... I discovered Linda Davis</i>
<i>tried both women...</i>

1547
01:32:18,093 --> 01:32:20,357
<i>Judges who presided</i>
<i>over each case gave...</i>

1548
01:32:20,562 --> 01:32:23,326
<i>The goal of the district attorney's</i>
<i>office is to see that...</i>

1549
01:32:23,532 --> 01:32:27,298
<i>... these seven unjustly imprisoned</i>
<i>women be released immediately...</i>

1550
01:32:27,502 --> 01:32:29,470
<i>... and be reunited</i>
<i>with their loved ones.</i>

1551
01:32:29,671 --> 01:32:33,266
<i>And it's the</i> Tom Joyner Morning Show.
<i>This morning I am outraged.</i>

1552
01:32:33,475 --> 01:32:38,310
<i>I am outraged about this prosecutor</i>
<i>that has got Madea in there.</i>

1553
01:32:38,513 --> 01:32:40,845
<i>This story is so unbelievable to me.</i>

1554
01:32:41,049 --> 01:32:42,812
<i>Reverend Al Sharpton. We're back.</i>

1555
01:32:43,018 --> 01:32:45,384
I wanna talk about this hotshot
district attorney...

1556
01:32:45,587 --> 01:32:47,452
...that's trying to build up a career...

1557
01:32:47,656 --> 01:32:49,521
- <i>... trumping up charges.</i>
- <i>Michael Baisden.</i>

1558
01:32:49,725 --> 01:32:53,684
<i>First, the Jena Six, now the Georgia</i>
<i>Seven, which includes Madea.</i>

1559
01:32:53,895 --> 01:32:57,228
<i>An elderly woman sentenced</i>
<i>for five years for a victimless crime.</i>

1560
01:32:57,432 --> 01:32:59,992
- <i>Know how we do</i> it...
- <i>Seventeen minutes after the hour.</i>

1561
01:33:00,202 --> 01:33:02,693
<i>Welcome back to the ride.</i>
Steve Harvey Morning Show.

1562
01:33:02,904 --> 01:33:05,930
<i>Call us because Madea</i>
<i>deserves to be freed.</i>

1563
01:33:06,141 --> 01:33:09,975
<i>And march down to the DA 's office</i>
<i>and get this accomplished.</i>

1564
01:33:16,184 --> 01:33:17,674
We are back now.

1565
01:33:17,886 --> 01:33:23,017
Mabel Simmons, also known
to the general population as Madea...

1566
01:33:23,225 --> 01:33:26,888
...has been arrested and there's been
yet another "Free Madea" rally.

1567
01:33:27,095 --> 01:33:28,357
Now, come on.

1568
01:33:28,563 --> 01:33:30,690
Okay, she carries a gun. Like carrying.

1569
01:33:30,899 --> 01:33:32,196
But she has to carry a gun.

1570
01:33:32,401 --> 01:33:34,801
She's a vulnerable older black woman.

1571
01:33:35,003 --> 01:33:36,698
Madea is not vulnerable.

1572
01:33:36,905 --> 01:33:37,894
That's how I see it.

1573
01:33:38,106 --> 01:33:40,904
We have a right to carry our guns.
It's in our constitution.

1574
01:33:41,109 --> 01:33:45,170
She bares all those arms. She got
guns, she's just cutting people down.

1575
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:46,813
And she was not the only one.

1576
01:33:47,015 --> 01:33:50,041
<i>You put six, seven women in jail</i>
<i>with these kind of sentences.</i>

1577
01:33:50,252 --> 01:33:52,686
<i>Is this the kind of justice</i>
<i>we're looking for?</i>

1578
01:33:52,888 --> 01:33:53,786
<i>We have a news alert.</i>

1579
01:33:53,955 --> 01:33:56,185
<i>I'm in front</i>
<i>of the Georgia State Courthouse...</i>

<i>... where Assistant District Attorney</i>
<i>Linda Davis...</i>

1581
01:33:58,927 --> 01:34:01,327
<i>... was indicted today</i>
<i>by a grand jury.</i>

1582
01:34:01,530 --> 01:34:04,966
<i>The charges include fraud, tampering,</i>
<i>and providing false documents.</i>

1583
01:34:05,167 --> 01:34:06,828
I wish that chick had tried my case.

1584
01:34:07,035 --> 01:34:08,730
<i>At some point maybe today...</i>

1585
01:34:08,937 --> 01:34:11,303
<i>... maybe tomorrow,</i>
<i>but at some point soon...</i>

1586
01:34:11,506 --> 01:34:15,272
<i>... Linda Davis will have</i>
<i>to turn herself in to the authorities...</i>

1587
01:34:15,477 --> 01:34:17,570
<i>... and she will be</i>
<i>officially processed.</i>

1588
01:34:17,779 --> 01:34:18,837
<i>What does that mean?</i>

1589
01:34:19,047 --> 01:34:20,844
<i>That means she will be</i>
<i>fingerprinted...</i>

1590
01:34:21,049 --> 01:34:24,712
<i>... and at some point she will stand</i>
<i>against the wall of shame...</i>

1591
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:26,911
<i>... and have her mugshot taken.</i>

1592
01:34:27,122 --> 01:34:29,682
<i>What a fall from grace</i>
<i>for Linda Davis.</i>

1593
01:34:29,891 --> 01:34:30,880
Hey, turn the TV on.

1594
01:34:31,092 --> 01:34:33,617
We sitting looking at that.
What's wrong with you?

1595
01:34:33,829 --> 01:34:34,818
Bernice Davis...

1596
01:34:35,263 --> 01:34:36,730

...Mabel Simmons...

1601
01:34:42,971 --> 01:34:44,563
...and Elizabeth Bryant.

1602
01:34:44,773 --> 01:34:47,071
There's been an investigation
in the DA's office...

1603
01:34:47,275 --> 01:34:49,766
...that has led
to the overturning of your convictions.

1604
01:34:49,978 --> 01:34:52,947
Get your things. You're going home.

1605
01:34:53,148 --> 01:34:54,581
What?

1606
01:34:55,617 --> 01:34:57,778
Group hug.

1607
01:35:03,592 --> 01:35:05,059
Do you feel justice was served?

1608
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:07,194
Yeah, justice is served.

1609
01:35:07,395 --> 01:35:10,796
You know, justice with...
Brian knows about the justice.

1610
01:35:10,999 --> 01:35:15,834
I just think that we all are really happy
that justice has been overturned.

1611
01:35:16,037 --> 01:35:19,495
And you know what? I'm gonna go
buy her a white dress with a white hat.

1612
01:35:19,708 --> 01:35:23,576
White ruffle pants, white ruffle socks
and shoes. Going to Church this time.

1613
01:35:23,778 --> 01:35:26,076
The person to ask is Madea.
Here she comes now.

1614
01:35:33,722 --> 01:35:35,656
Soldier boy.

1615
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:39,990
I've nothing to say.
I've nothing to say.

1616
01:35:40,195 --> 01:35:42,686
It's just been really tough
being up in that prison.

1617
01:35:42,898 --> 01:35:47,164
They did all this stuff to try to get me
down but do... You can't keep me down.

1618
01:35:47,369 --> 01:35:50,031
Praise the Lord. God bless you.
Hallelujah.

1619
01:36:23,004 --> 01:36:24,869
They tell me you're the best.

1620
01:36:25,073 --> 01:36:26,904
Well, look, I don't usually do this.

1621
01:36:27,108 --> 01:36:30,373
I mean, you need to know that.
I don't usually see people individually.

1622
01:36:30,579 --> 01:36:34,538
I saw the videotape of you
getting arrested and I thought...

1623
01:36:34,749 --> 01:36:36,148
...I've got to see this woman.

1624
01:36:36,351 --> 01:36:40,879
- You can't think what you did was okay.
- You don't know what happened.

1625
01:36:41,089 --> 01:36:45,617
What do you mean? I saw it on tape.
I saw you forklift the lady's car...

1626
01:36:45,827 --> 01:36:48,557
...out of a parking space.
- You're talking about that time.

1627
01:36:48,763 --> 01:36:50,754
I ain't know what you talking about.

1628
01:36:50,966 --> 01:36:52,627
Oh, they had that on video too?

1629
01:36:52,834 --> 01:36:55,928
Know what, that woman just...
I've been riding by that parking lot...

1630
01:36:56,137 --> 01:36:59,197
...my air conditioner don't work
in my Cadillac, that '78 Cadillac.

1631
01:36:59,407 --> 01:37:02,638
And I was driving around
and could not get a parking spot.

1632
01:37:02,844 --> 01:37:05,813
There she was, zoomed in there,
knew I was waiting for that spot.

1633
01:37:06,014 --> 01:37:09,541
- What else was I supposed to do?
- Well, you go on to another space.

1634
01:37:09,751 --> 01:37:11,946
Do you have to be in control
all the time?

1635
01:37:12,988 --> 01:37:14,785
No, I don't have to be in control.

1636
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:17,686
That was my parking spot.
I wasn't going to another space.

1637
01:37:17,892 --> 01:37:20,417
That was the closest to the door.
That's the one I want.

1638
01:37:20,629 --> 01:37:23,223
Other people want stuff too.
It's not just about you.

1639
01:37:23,431 --> 01:37:25,422
It's not just about you all the time.

1640
01:37:25,634 --> 01:37:27,124
In my world, it's about me.

1641
01:37:27,335 --> 01:37:29,929
This is Madea's world.
It's about me, Dr. Phil.

1642
01:37:30,138 --> 01:37:32,231
Do you get angry
when you feel out of control?

1643
01:37:32,574 --> 01:37:35,907
I'm never angry. I keep telling people
I am not angry, okay?

1644
01:37:36,111 --> 01:37:38,079
Somebody do something to me,
I do something.

1645
01:37:38,279 --> 01:37:40,144
You don't bother me,
I don't bother you.

1646
01:37:40,348 --> 01:37:42,680
You weren't angry when you
flipped over this car?

1647
01:37:42,884 --> 01:37:44,442
I was calm and cool as a cucumber.

1648
01:37:44,653 --> 01:37:47,247
- I was sitting there smoking a cigarette.
- Are you crazy?

1649
01:37:47,455 --> 01:37:48,513
A little bit.

1650
01:37:48,723 --> 01:37:50,953
- I got a question for you.
- I got a question too.

1651
01:37:51,159 --> 01:37:53,650
- What about your childhood?
- What about your childhood?

1652
01:37:53,862 --> 01:37:56,456
Talking about my childhood
is not gonna help your anger.

1653
01:37:56,665 --> 01:37:57,996
I keep saying I'm not angry.

1654
01:37:58,199 --> 01:38:01,566
- But you keep insisting I am.
- Are you happy to be talking to me?

1655
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:05,069
I would much rather be at the casino
playing blackjack or something.

1656
01:38:05,273 --> 01:38:06,865
But they told me I have to see you.

1657
01:38:07,075 --> 01:38:08,064
- So I'm here.
- Why?

1658
01:38:08,276 --> 01:38:09,641
Because the court made me.

1659
01:38:09,844 --> 01:38:13,507
You forklift a woman's car
out of the parking lot.

1660
01:38:13,715 --> 01:38:15,342
Does that seem reasonable to you?

1661
01:38:15,550 --> 01:38:17,074
She took the parking spot.

1662
01:38:17,852 --> 01:38:20,446
- It isn't your parking spot.
- Yes, it was.

1663
01:38:20,655 --> 01:38:22,384
Did it have your name on it?

1664
01:38:22,590 --> 01:38:24,319
Did it have your name on it?

1665
01:38:24,826 --> 01:38:27,124
It had handicap.
That matches what I had in my car.

1666
01:38:27,328 --> 01:38:30,764
She took it with her little convertible
so I lifted it, flipped it.

1667
01:38:31,266 --> 01:38:34,064
Well, yeah, I believe
the handicapped part. I got that.

1668
01:38:34,269 --> 01:38:36,737
What are you trying to say?
Something's wrong with me?

1669
01:38:36,938 --> 01:38:39,372
Did you see me walk in here? I'm fine.

1670
01:38:39,574 --> 01:38:41,599
What are you doing
in the handicapped space?

1671
01:38:41,810 --> 01:38:43,937
Because it was closer to the door.

1672
01:38:45,513 --> 01:38:46,502
What?

1673
01:38:52,687 --> 01:38:53,745
It's closer to the door.

1674
01:38:53,955 --> 01:38:56,355
They always leave the handicap
close to the door.

1675
01:38:56,558 --> 01:38:57,650
That's why I take it.

1676
01:38:57,859 --> 01:39:00,350
Do you feel
like you always have to get even?

1677
01:39:00,895 --> 01:39:03,295
- Hell, yeah.
- Why do you always have to get even?

1678
01:39:03,498 --> 01:39:06,763
Why can't you just let it roll off
like water off a duck's back?

1679
01:39:06,968 --> 01:39:08,492
Because I ain't no damn duck.

1680
01:39:08,803 --> 01:39:10,293
You don't have to attack people.

1681
01:39:10,505 --> 01:39:12,973
Somebody do something to you,
you do something to you.

1682
01:39:13,174 --> 01:39:17,804
The Bible said in second Deutoronomo,
the book of Jericho that:

1683
01:39:18,012 --> 01:39:20,037
"The eye for a tooth,
a tooth for the people.

1684
01:39:20,248 --> 01:39:22,079
If everybody got the eye,
punch them in it."

1685
01:39:23,651 --> 01:39:26,711
- What?
- I can tell you don't read the Bible.

1686
01:39:26,921 --> 01:39:28,582
Bible say, "Turn the other cheek."

1687
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:31,554
Somebody hit that cheek,
turn the other. You have two cheeks.

1688
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:34,422
How many you gonna let them hit
before you whup their ass?

1689
01:39:34,629 --> 01:39:36,494
I don't think
you have to whup their ass.

1690
01:39:36,698 --> 01:39:37,960
It ain't about ass-whupping.

1691
01:39:38,166 --> 01:39:41,067
You don't open up a can of whupass
on everybody that you meet.

1692
01:39:41,269 --> 01:39:43,100
- You go with the flow.
- What do you mean?

1693
01:39:43,304 --> 01:39:45,772
Letting people walk over you
like a doormat?

1694
01:39:45,974 --> 01:39:49,876
No. I've been in this life too long to
let some people just walk all over me.

1695
01:39:50,078 --> 01:39:53,536
- I'm not gonna do that.
- But it's easy for you to get bothered.

1696
01:39:53,748 --> 01:39:56,808
It doesn't take a whole lot
for you to get bothered.

1697
01:39:57,018 --> 01:39:58,178
"No, it doesn't."

1698
01:39:58,386 --> 01:39:59,546
"Yes, it does."

1699
01:39:59,921 --> 01:40:01,445
"I beg to differ."

1700
01:40:02,090 --> 01:40:05,526
- Do you sleep well at night?
- Do you sleep well at night?

1701
01:40:06,594 --> 01:40:09,859
Okay, let's try not to answer a question
with a question, okay?

1702
01:40:10,064 --> 01:40:13,227
If you stop asking questions
I'll stop answering with a question.

1703
01:40:13,434 --> 01:40:15,868
- Can you stop?
- Can you stop?

1704
01:40:17,305 --> 01:40:18,704
Okay, all right. Look, look.

1705
01:40:18,907 --> 01:40:20,568
Are you getting angry, doctor?

1706
01:40:20,775 --> 01:40:21,833
Yeah, I'm getting angry.

1707
01:40:22,043 --> 01:40:24,341
- Answer the question.
- Answer what question?

1708
01:40:24,579 --> 01:40:26,547
This isn't working. This isn't helping.

1709
01:40:26,748 --> 01:40:29,478
I told the judge
I didn't need to come here.

1710
01:40:29,784 --> 01:40:31,615
- But you're here.
- Yes, I am here.

1711
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:34,550
- You're not making any sense.
- You're not making any sense.

1712
01:40:34,756 --> 01:40:37,554
Do you talk to people
like this all the time?

1713
01:40:37,826 --> 01:40:39,191
What? What are they gonna do?

1714
01:40:39,394 --> 01:40:41,453
I'm 6-foot-5,
what the hell are they gonna do?

1715
01:40:41,663 --> 01:40:42,960
Yes, I say what's on my mind.

1716
01:40:43,164 --> 01:40:46,395
Ain't nobody gonna run over me.
I'll say what's on my mind.

1717
01:40:46,801 --> 01:40:47,995
Well, what's on your mind?

1718
01:40:49,237 --> 01:40:50,431
What's on your mind?

1719
01:40:51,439 --> 01:40:53,703
Okay, wh...? Is there...?
What are you, a parrot?

1720
01:40:53,908 --> 01:40:55,034
Is there an echo in here?

1721
01:40:55,243 --> 01:40:56,835
There's not a parrot, not an echo.

1722
01:40:57,045 --> 01:41:00,640
None of those things are in here.
I'm talking. They told me to see you.

1723
01:41:00,849 --> 01:41:03,579
You're supposed to help me.
I keep telling I'm not angry.

1724
01:41:03,785 --> 01:41:06,151
- You're not angry?
- No, I'm not angry.

1725
01:41:06,354 --> 01:41:09,653
I don't know how many times I have
to tell you I'm not angry, Dr. Phil.

1726
01:41:09,858 --> 01:41:13,589
- How can you tell if you're angry?
- I could tell if I'm angry, if I'm angry.

1727
01:41:13,795 --> 01:41:17,196
- If I was angry I would know I'm angry.
- You don't think you're angry now?

1728
01:41:17,398 --> 01:41:19,423
- No.
- You're yelling, you're screaming.

1729
01:41:19,667 --> 01:41:21,692
- You're yelling.
- You're driving me crazy.

1730
01:41:21,903 --> 01:41:25,134
But you're the doctor.
You're supposed to handle this hell.

1731
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:27,706
You're a psychologist.
You've studied with the best.

1732
01:41:27,909 --> 01:41:30,139
You been all over the world
learning about people.

1733
01:41:30,345 --> 01:41:33,576
- And you let a little woman upset you.
- They never told me about you.

1734
01:41:33,781 --> 01:41:36,147
I missed that class,
I can tell you for sure.

1735
01:41:36,351 --> 01:41:38,819
I missed the class
where they went over Madea.

1736
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:43,150
- Right. Madea 101, baby. You learn it.
- Yeah.

1737
01:41:44,225 --> 01:41:47,456
All right, look. We're getting nowhere.
That's enough.

1738
01:41:47,662 --> 01:41:48,924
- Okay.
- Enough, I've had it.

1739
01:41:49,130 --> 01:41:52,122
That's enough. We're out of here.
You're fired.

1740
01:41:52,333 --> 01:41:55,564
Great. Thank you, Dr. Phil Trump.

1741
01:41:57,739 --> 01:42:01,573
- Can we go now? Is it over?
- It's over, yes. You can leave. Please.

1742
01:42:01,776 --> 01:42:04,802
Please tell the judge we had this
session and it was the best one.

1743
01:42:05,146 --> 01:42:07,944
I'm gonna tell the judge
that you would have to get better...

1744
01:42:08,149 --> 01:42:10,140
...to be crazy.

1745
01:42:10,852 --> 01:42:14,288
How the hell do you get better...?

1746
01:42:17,191 --> 01:42:21,992
- Well, I guess that's it then.
- I guess that's it, you can leave.

1747
01:42:21,993 --> 01:42:22,993
