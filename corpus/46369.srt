that boy was using her.

534
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,152
The kiss
was mereIy a device...

535
00:22:35,194 --> 00:22:37,958
so that he couId get
his 15 minutes of fame.

536
00:22:37,997 --> 00:22:39,487
And her friends
didn't heIp, either.

537
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:42,558
Anna, FaIana, Banana,
Bandana, Montana...

538
00:22:42,602 --> 00:22:44,968
I have no idea
what you're taIking about.

539
00:22:45,037 --> 00:22:46,868
Why didn't she have
enough common sense...

540
00:22:46,939 --> 00:22:48,133
to deaI with this?

541
00:22:48,207 --> 00:22:49,674
She's onIy 15...

542
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:52,711
but today,
she acted beyond her years.

543
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:55,305
She showed great respect...

544
00:22:55,348 --> 00:22:56,975
and gracefuIIy accepted
your criticism.

545
00:22:57,016 --> 00:23:00,076
You're saying that as a queen,
I was too harsh on her.

546
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,747
I was criticaI of the person...

547
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:05,952
who couId become
the next ruIer of my country.

548
00:23:05,992 --> 00:23:07,550
No. I'm saying,
as a grandmother...

549
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:11,188
you might have been too harsh
on your granddaughter.

550
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,562
[Sighs]

551
00:23:15,168 --> 00:23:17,363
Do you think she can do it?

552
00:23:17,436 --> 00:23:20,405
Oh, I have no doubts, ma'am.

553
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:22,771
I thought so, too.

554
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:28,807
What makes you different

555
00:23:28,848 --> 00:23:31,442
Makes you beautiful

556
00:23:31,484 --> 00:23:33,384
What's there inside you

557
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:36,820

00:23:48,768 --> 00:23:50,963

What makes you different

What's there inside you

566
00:23:58,511 --> 00:24:01,207

Hey, can I taIk to you
for a minute, pIease?

571
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,624
LiIIy, can I just
taIk to you for a minute?

572
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,925
-Is that cooI?
-Sure. Let's taIk.

573
00:24:17,964 --> 00:24:20,125
But about what, hmm?

574
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,793
How you broke
my brother's heart...

575
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:23,927
or how you stuck me
with Jeremiah...

576
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,335
during my cabIe show doing...

577
00:24:25,404 --> 00:24:27,668
''Pick a card, pick a card.''
Mwah mwah mwah!

578
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,900
I'm sorry, OK?

579
00:24:28,975 --> 00:24:30,169
I forgot to caII you
and teII you...

580
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:31,267
that I couIdn't make it.

581
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,608
So I was stuck with
the Happy Houdini...

582
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:35,978
whiIe you make out
with the Yachting Yahoo.

583
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:37,846
Those are reaIIy
good aIIiterations.

584
00:24:37,884 --> 00:24:40,079
No! I don't want to taIk
about aIIiterations!

585
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:42,849
LiIIy, I came up here
to teII you that I'm sorry!

586
00:24:42,889 --> 00:24:45,119
I'm sorry I missed
your cabIe show...

587
00:24:45,157 --> 00:24:48,456
and I'm just reaIIy sorry.

588
00:24:48,494 --> 00:24:52,191
LILL Y: I can't beIieve
that you hung me up...

589
00:24:52,231 --> 00:24:53,960
after aII I did for you.

590
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,230
I kept your royaI secret.

591
00:24:56,269 --> 00:24:57,861
And do you know
how hard it is...

592
00:24:57,937 --> 00:24:59,768
to have a cabIe show
and keep a secret?

593
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,363
You didn't keep it
a secret from me...

594
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,670
how jerky you thought
my being a princess was.

595
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,609
WeII, congratuIations.
You got your wish.

596
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:07,203
I'm not gonna be a princess.

597
00:25:07,246 --> 00:25:08,440
You're not?

598
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:09,846
No.

599
00:25:09,882 --> 00:25:13,249
But I want you to be.

600
00:25:13,286 --> 00:25:15,220
What?

[Sighs]

602
00:25:17,123 --> 00:25:18,647
I didn't mean it.

603
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:21,251
The green monster
of jeaIousy came out...

604
00:25:21,294 --> 00:25:23,489
because you were Miss PopuIar...

605
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:25,497
and l thought l was
losing my best friend...

606
00:25:25,531 --> 00:25:29,433
so I got angry and upset
and hurt and...

607
00:25:29,468 --> 00:25:30,958
I toId you!

608
00:25:31,037 --> 00:25:33,028
I need an attitude adjustment.

609
00:25:33,105 --> 00:25:35,938
But the truth is...

610
00:25:35,975 --> 00:25:39,775
you being a princess
is kind of a miracIe.

611
00:25:39,812 --> 00:25:41,439
Whoa! No!

612
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,311
What miracIe?

613
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:45,510
It's a nightmare!

614
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:47,746
No! Think about it!

615
00:25:47,787 --> 00:25:49,687
I just found out
that my cabIe show...

616
00:25:49,722 --> 00:25:51,314
onIy reaches 12 peopIe.

617
00:25:51,357 --> 00:25:55,919
Wanting to rock the world,
but having zip power like me--

618
00:25:55,962 --> 00:25:57,623
now, that's a nightmare.

619
00:25:57,663 --> 00:25:59,927
But you--Wow!

620
00:25:59,966 --> 00:26:01,934
I mean...

621
00:26:01,968 --> 00:26:05,165
MIA: What is so ''Wow''?

622
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:09,706
Wow is having the power
to affect change...

623
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:11,004
make peopIe Iisten.

624
00:26:11,043 --> 00:26:13,204
How many teenagers
have that power?

625
00:26:13,245 --> 00:26:15,042
What more of a miracIe
do you want?

626
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:16,514
WeII...

627
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:20,383
we'II just have to find
a different miracIe.

628

Not more, just different.

You don't have to wear a tux.

730
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,489
You can wear sweatpants
for aII I care.

731
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:30,729
Don't worry about me.

732

Listen, Jere.
My friends and I were wondering.

751
00:31:25,557 --> 00:31:27,923
The sweater you're wearing--
was it designed for you...

752
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,894
or did the knitting machine
just bIow up?

753
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:31,691
Sunglasses, girls.

754
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,198
It's Jeremiah hair gIare.

-Hey, Lana?
-Huh?

That is such

lt's so clean-cut.

760
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:46,738
I bet it goes with anything.

761
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,576
Of course it does!

762

Yeah, l am, but you know what?

Someday
I might grow out of that...

774
00:32:14,373 --> 00:32:17,274
Oh, no, honey, I'm sorry.

775
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:19,209
I was in
a very important meeting.

776

777

CLARlSSE/ lt's a present
for your sixteenth birthday...

779
00:32:39,365 --> 00:32:40,593
from your father.

780
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:43,624
It was found
among his possessions.

781
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:46,797
My birthday's not for two weeks.

782
00:32:46,872 --> 00:32:48,066
CLARlSSE/ l know...

783
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,267
but I wanted you to have it
before we Ieave.

784
00:32:50,342 --> 00:32:53,311
I return to Genovia
the day after tomorrow.

785
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:57,406
Thank you.

786
00:32:57,449 --> 00:32:58,848
It's Iocked.

787
00:32:58,884 --> 00:33:02,047
If you open the Iocket
I gave you...

788
00:33:02,087 --> 00:33:03,611
it becomes the key.

789
00:33:03,655 --> 00:33:07,147
Thank you
for bringing it down here.

790
00:33:07,192 --> 00:33:10,025
CLARlSSE/ l also
came to apologize...

791
00:33:10,062 --> 00:33:12,792
for the way l spoke to you
about the beach incident.

792
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:14,162
It was judgementaI of me.

793
00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:17,293
I didn't pause
to verify the facts.

794
00:33:17,336 --> 00:33:18,997
That's aII right, Grandma.

795
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:22,302
I've been thinking about it
a great deaI...

796
00:33:22,374 --> 00:33:23,466
and the truth is...

797
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:26,841
I think you'd make
a very fine princess.

798
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,540
You know, people think...

799
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,639
princesses are supposed
to wear tiaras...

800
00:33:30,682 --> 00:33:32,741
marry the prince,
always look pretty...

801
00:33:32,785 --> 00:33:35,049
and live happily ever after...

802
00:33:35,087 --> 00:33:37,351
but it's so much more
than that.

803
00:33:37,389 --> 00:33:39,789
It's a reaI job.

804
00:33:43,796 --> 00:33:48,460
You are an extraordinary person,
Grandma...

805
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,196
but I don't think
I'm meant to do this.

806
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,899
I wouId be so afraid...

807
00:33:54,973 --> 00:33:58,739
that I wouId disappoint
the peopIe of Genovia...

808
00:33:58,777 --> 00:34:00,506
and I couIdn't bear...

809
00:34:00,546 --> 00:34:03,845
to disappoint you again.

810
00:34:06,952 --> 00:34:09,045
WeII, as I said...

811
00:34:09,087 --> 00:34:11,647
I have faith in you.

812
00:34:16,528 --> 00:34:18,519
-I'm a writer.
-Ah!

813
00:34:18,564 --> 00:34:20,191
I write soaps--
soap opera.

814
00:34:20,232 --> 00:34:22,325
Mm-hmm.

815
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:24,028
Did you ever see
''MiddIe House Road''?

816
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:25,969
No. No, no.

817
00:34:26,038 --> 00:34:27,767
It's a big hit.

818
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,740
I wrote a character
just Iike you once.

819
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:30,833
He was a spy.

820
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:32,467
I'm not a spy.

821
00:34:32,544 --> 00:34:35,138
That's what
the character said.

822

-Make a speech?
-Mm-hmm.

829
00:34:56,802 --> 00:34:59,669
Do you think that maybe...

830
00:34:59,738 --> 00:35:01,638
considering
my history with the press...

831
00:35:01,673 --> 00:35:02,867

if you did it?

832

I promised
I'd Iet my mom drive me.

839
00:35:20,626 --> 00:35:22,787
