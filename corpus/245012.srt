1
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,800
Well?

2
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,160
Nothing.

3
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,700
Where was it?

4
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,421
In a plastic bag, on the porch.

5
00:02:41,822 --> 00:02:43,222
What's wrong?

6
00:03:09,863 --> 00:03:11,464
He must have been there, no?

7
00:03:13,623 --> 00:03:14,723
Come inside.

8
00:03:37,305 --> 00:03:40,505
Tomorrow, I'll ask the Rochants
and Beaufays if they saw anything.

9
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,870
He must have been there for a while.

10
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:44,345
I already called
Antoine. He saw nothing.

11
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,545
I got Marie's answering machine.

12
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:51,626
The tape runs for over 2 hours.

13
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:13,947
- When did you leave?
- I don't know.

14
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:17,024
Not long after you. Around 8:45.

15
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:20,067
- François called to...
- There!

16
00:04:20,102 --> 00:04:21,202
Give it here.

17
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:41,309
How did I manage to miss this
guy? I can't figure it out.

18
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,994
Maybe the camera was in a car.

19
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:49,029
It doesn't look filmed through a window

20
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:52,029
Someplace on that house maybe?

21
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,950
It's dumb. I don't know what to say.

22
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,870
Can you think of someone
who might do this as a prank?

23
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,470
We should eat before
it's totally ruined.

24
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:19,116
Maybe a friend of Pierrot's.

25
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:23,151
Some idiot playing games
with his pal's unhip parents.

26
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:29,592
- No?
- I doubt it. It's not really funny.

27
00:05:29,786 --> 00:05:30,886
That's for sure.

28
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:36,117
- Where is he anyway?
- Who?

29
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:40,152
- Pierrot
- No idea. He'll be home soon.

30
00:05:47,353 --> 00:05:48,453
Was it in there?

31
00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:49,873
- What?
- The tape.

32
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:52,553
No, in a supermarket bag.

33
00:05:52,588 --> 00:05:53,688
Where is it?

34
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:57,953
I have no idea. In the living room, or
the den, or out in the hall. Who cares?

35
00:06:00,154 --> 00:06:02,039
There was nothing inside?
No note or anything?

36
00:06:02,074 --> 00:06:03,793
No, but nothing's stopping
you from checking for yourself.

37
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,354
Can you bring the salad?

38
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:21,915
Nothing fancy tonight.

39
00:06:39,396 --> 00:06:41,316
- That the bag it was in?
- Yes.

40
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:47,396
What, you think I'm an idiot?

41
00:06:49,557 --> 00:06:51,637
You could have missed something.

42
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:57,837
You should eject the tape. Maybe
I missed a label or something.

43
00:06:57,872 --> 00:06:59,237
Look, I'm only trying to...

44
00:07:00,357 --> 00:07:04,357
Ah, the sonny boy is here.
Better late than never.

45
00:07:07,518 --> 00:07:09,803
- Hi there.
- Hi.

46
00:07:09,838 --> 00:07:13,838
Sit down, Pierrot.
I'll bring you a plate.

47
00:07:22,798 --> 00:07:24,479
- Where were you?
- At Yves'.

48
00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:25,518
Why?

49
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,519
Why? I want to know. Do I need a reason?

50
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:34,280
- Evening, Pierrot.
- Evening, mom.

51
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:38,164
- Well?
- On Tuesdays, I go to Yves'.

52
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,199
Wednesdays, we have geometry
and he helps with my homework.

53
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,520
Maybe it's one of your fans.

54
00:07:58,121 --> 00:08:02,121
Pierrot, don't breathe in the breakout.

55
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:10,241
André, same for you. Don't
breathe in the breakout.

56
00:08:10,716 --> 00:08:12,761
- What?
- Hold your breath in the breakout.

57
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:15,881
Thomas, think about your kick.

58
00:08:20,202 --> 00:08:22,522
Pierrot, too shallow on the turn.

59
00:08:22,557 --> 00:08:23,722
More depth.

60
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:33,162
André, that's good,
but you went too deep.

61
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:36,123
Too much depth.

62
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,083
Thomas, watch your breathing.

63
00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:19,898
See you again in two weeks
for another round table.

64
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:23,933
Until then, good reading and thanks to
the new viewers tuning in every week.

65
00:11:27,373 --> 00:11:28,473
Goodnight.

66
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:33,293
<i>Stay seated while the
credits roll, please!</i>

67
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:42,374
<i>Thank you everybody!</i>

68
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:18,536
The tape was wrapped in it.

69
00:12:46,538 --> 00:12:47,658
What is it?

70
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:50,339
What's going on?

71
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:52,438
Georges?

72
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:55,924
What?

73
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:58,999
Nothing...

74
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:01,580
Nothing, I...

75
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,499
I'm tired.

76
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,520
What do we do now?

77
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,520
Meaning?

78
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,660
You want to call the police?

79
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,160
Yes...

80
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:26,020
No... I don't know. Let
me see the drawing again.

81
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:36,142
Maybe we should report it now.

82
00:13:39,982 --> 00:13:42,781
It looks like a child's drawing.

83
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:44,602
No idea. I can't tell.

84
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:49,822
Should I ask Pierrot?

85
00:13:52,063 --> 00:13:53,182
No, what's the use?

86
00:13:55,343 --> 00:13:58,343
You really think one of his friends
would stay out all night to spy on us?

87
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,290
That would be stupid.

88
00:14:04,663 --> 00:14:06,063
Why did you stop it?

89
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:07,443
Why not?

90
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:10,463
What more do you want to see?

91
00:14:12,464 --> 00:14:14,144
It's dumb but I'm scared.

92
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:23,745
Did you talk to Pierrot about it?

93
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:25,904
No, do you think we should?

94
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:27,324
I don't know.

95
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:31,945
I no longer buy the
schoolboy prank theory.

96
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,944
What then?

97
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:35,025
What? What? I haven't a clue.

98
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:54,191
Hello?

99
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:55,346
<i>- Mme Laurent
- Yes.</i>

100
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,371
<i>Hi, this is Manu. Is Georges there?</i>

101
00:14:57,546 --> 00:15:00,007
You just missed him by a
couple of minutes. Sorry.

102
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:03,199
<i>I wanted to remind him
about the Beaumont file.</i>

103
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,800
He took it. I saw him.

104
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:07,536
<i>Great, thank you. Have a good day.</i>

105
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:09,587
Bye, Manu.

106
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:18,287
Yes?

107
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,193
<i>I'd like to speak to Georges Laurent.</i>

108
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:24,228
<i>- Who's asking?
- I'd like to speak to Georges Laurent.</i>

109
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:29,393
Who are you? What do you want?

110
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,109
<i>I'd like to speak to the man
by the name of Georges Laurent.</i>

111
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:37,273
- Hello.
- Hi. I just spoke to your wife...

112
00:15:37,308 --> 00:15:40,008
...she wants you to call her back.
- OK, thank you.

113
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:53,190
What's this card?

114
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:55,870
It came in the mail.

115
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,070
What's wrong with you, dickhead?

116
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,749
What?

117
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,631
Can't you be more careful, idiot?

118
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,590
Forget it.

119
00:16:10,591 --> 00:16:12,191
- Say that again.
- What?

120
00:16:12,226 --> 00:16:13,756
Repeat what you just said.

121
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,391
Don't you have eyes in your head?

122
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:19,512
I must be dreaming. Which moron
stepped out without looking?

123
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:21,712
But who's going the wrong way down a one
- way street?

124
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:27,996
Yell at me again.

125
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:29,717
Come on, yell at me again.

126
00:16:29,752 --> 00:16:31,437
OK, let's not fight about this.

127
00:16:31,472 --> 00:16:35,392
You weren't looking. And
we weren't looking, OK?

128
00:16:37,272 --> 00:16:40,392
You'd better keep your big mouth shut.

129
00:16:58,754 --> 00:17:00,354
I'm sorry.

130
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:03,354
In any case... We know
we're not getting any help.

131
00:17:06,114 --> 00:17:09,914
As long as he doesn't torch the house
or send us bombs instead of tapes...

132
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:11,195
...we're in good shape.

133
00:17:11,954 --> 00:17:13,754
Please, Georges.

134
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:12,244
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, Pierrot.

135
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:14,638
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?

136
00:18:14,673 --> 00:18:17,358
Why are you picking me up?

137
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:24,959
I had some free time.
I thought you'd like it.

138
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:26,499
I see.

139
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,920
No, I dropped Mom at work
and I wanted us to talk.

140
00:18:30,955 --> 00:18:32,055
Why?

141
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,800
Where was she?

142
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:37,959
We had stuff to do. That's why
I wanted to talk to you, too.

143
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:40,375
I see.

144
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,960
What's with that card you sent?

145
00:18:45,995 --> 00:18:47,160
What card?

146
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:52,861
This one.

147
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,401
The teacher gave it to me at lunch.

148
00:18:57,601 --> 00:19:01,601
She didn't get the weird drawing, but
found it odd you'd send cards to school.

149
00:20:29,086 --> 00:20:32,886
Sitting all the way in the back
next to the mirror, you know.

150
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:36,007
Never keep a lady waiting,
especially an elderly lady.

151
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:38,532
So I go over, introduce myself...

152
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:42,567
...and ask why she wants to see me. She
apologizes for summoning me like that.

153
00:20:43,168 --> 00:20:45,448
She offers me a seat.
She seems very emotional.

154
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:46,749
So I sit next to her.

155
00:20:46,968 --> 00:20:50,038
She says she's never been here before,

156
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:52,208
and isn't in the habit
of accosting strangers.

157
00:20:52,243 --> 00:20:54,808
But I strongly remind her of someone,

158
00:20:54,843 --> 00:20:56,493
and she couldn't help herself.

159
00:20:56,528 --> 00:20:58,649
It was someone she had loved very much.

160
00:20:58,684 --> 00:21:00,414
What could I do?

161
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:04,449
She was in her 70s. It was
touching, her hands trembled.

162
00:21:04,684 --> 00:21:06,053
Anyway...

163
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:09,089
You know I'm not the sentimental type.

164
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:11,008
Not really.

165
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:12,895
But she really got to me.

166
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,849
So I'm eagerly waiting to hear about
this guy I remind her of so much.

167
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:19,047
Who do you think it was?

168
00:21:19,082 --> 00:21:21,210
Her lover? Father? Husband?

169
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,063
It was her dog.

170
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:26,597
Exactly.

171
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,575
What would you have done?

172
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,816
So I stand up and I say:
"Excellent, you've had your fun."

173
00:21:31,851 --> 00:21:35,851
And I turn to leave. Straight-faced,
she begs me to me sit down.

174
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:38,251
She says she knows it
all sounds ridiculous,

175
00:21:38,286 --> 00:21:40,211
but I must stay a bit longer,

176
00:21:40,246 --> 00:21:42,136
and hear her story out.

177
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:44,857
She would never dare to make fun of me.

178
00:21:44,892 --> 00:21:47,691
It was weird, but she
seemed so desperate...

179
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:49,576
I sat back down.

180
00:21:49,611 --> 00:21:53,611
And she begins her story. How her
dog died in a traffic accident in '64.

181
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:55,909
That's funny, I say...

182
00:21:55,944 --> 00:21:57,937
I was born in '64.

183
00:21:57,972 --> 00:22:01,417
She seemed offended that I
wasn't taking her seriously.

184
00:22:01,452 --> 00:22:05,452
She looked at me sadly and said,
"He was run over by a van...

185
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:09,653
...on April 17, 1964, as we
were about to cross the street.

186
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:14,333
April 17... It's my birthday.

187
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,253
No way!

188
00:22:16,854 --> 00:22:19,373
That's exactly what I said.

189
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:21,778
So she fills me in on the details.

190
00:22:21,813 --> 00:22:25,813
She stepped out with her dog,
but a high vehicle hid the van,

191
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:28,139
which ran over the dog.

192
00:22:28,174 --> 00:22:31,414
The bumper hit its
neck. The wound was deep.

193
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:33,731
The dog died soon after.

194
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:36,014
You won't believe this...

195
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:37,149
Give me your hand.

196
00:22:37,415 --> 00:22:39,529
I have a scar in the exact same spot.

197
00:22:56,415 --> 00:22:59,616
Come on, is it true or not?

198
00:23:06,816 --> 00:23:07,916
Not bad.

199
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:11,456
Where did you hear that one?

200
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,057
You don't believe me?

201
00:23:20,937 --> 00:23:23,457
You know Frédéric called me?

202
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:25,737
Simone's better. The
operation was last week.

203
00:23:26,778 --> 00:23:29,542
We've hardly been to see her recently.

204
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:33,458
To be honest, we were never very
close. She was always so distant.

205
00:23:33,493 --> 00:23:35,858
It's hard to develop a bond.

206
00:23:35,893 --> 00:23:37,303
And Frédéric?

207
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:38,618
He's writing a screenplay.

208
00:23:38,653 --> 00:23:39,753
About that?

209
00:23:40,858 --> 00:23:42,463
No, but Maubert bought it.

210
00:23:42,498 --> 00:23:44,619
Where's her daughter while
she's in the hospital?

211
00:23:44,654 --> 00:23:47,059
With him and his girlfriend.

212
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:48,299
What's she like?

213
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:49,499
Nice.

214
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:53,979
It's tough when friends break
up, and you have to take sides.

215
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:56,504
Frédéric's changed a lot.

216
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:58,459
He's more outgoing
since he met Marianne.

217
00:23:58,494 --> 00:23:59,819
Her name is Marianne?

218
00:23:59,854 --> 00:24:00,939
Yes.

219
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,619
What's the screenplay about?

220
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,659
What screenplay?

221
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,540
Isn't Frédéric writing one?

222
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:09,860
Oh, yeah... I have no idea.

223
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:14,900
Expecting anyone else?

224
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,640
No.

225
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:23,141
I'll go see.

226
00:24:24,181 --> 00:24:26,981
Who can it be at this time?

227
00:24:27,061 --> 00:24:27,820
No idea.

228
00:24:27,821 --> 00:24:30,101
One of his fans no
doubt. The price of fame.

229
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:34,136
Groupies all over you...

230
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:41,362
Who's there?

231
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:46,282
Who's there?

232
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:25,945
What's this all about?

233
00:25:26,345 --> 00:25:28,265
Show yourself, coward!

234
00:25:28,545 --> 00:25:31,865
Show yourself and say what you want!

235
00:25:35,545 --> 00:25:36,645
Pathetic!

236
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:43,869
...apparently, it plays
through the 15th...

237
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,309
- Well?
- Nothing.

238
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:49,390
- Nothing?
- There was nobody.

239
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:51,430
There was nobody outside.

240
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,610
OK then...

241
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:57,390
You're spoiling us. I'll
have to diet for 3 weeks.

242
00:26:57,425 --> 00:27:00,090
Why were you out there so long?

243
00:27:06,951 --> 00:27:09,551
It's OK. Everything's
OK. There's no problem.

244
00:27:11,912 --> 00:27:15,912
I'm not some jealous wife who
suspects hubby's cheating on her.

245
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:18,834
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

246
00:27:19,032 --> 00:27:21,957
I'm a bit on edge because
in the last few days

247
00:27:21,992 --> 00:27:24,232
we've been getting anonymous
parcels and phone calls.

248
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,070
I jump every time the doorbell rings,

249
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:29,873
and I think it's our asshole stalker.

250
00:27:29,908 --> 00:27:31,392
What kind of calls?

251
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:34,353
I don't know how... to describe them.

252
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,632
You've been to the police?

253
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:37,767
Of course.

254
00:27:37,793 --> 00:27:38,893
And?

255
00:27:38,952 --> 00:27:41,633
And nothing. They'll only
move when we're attacked.

256
00:27:41,668 --> 00:27:44,753
- It's outrageous!
- It's a fact.

257
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:48,514
Dig in before it gets cold.

258
00:27:50,513 --> 00:27:52,433
So what was it?

259
00:27:56,203 --> 00:27:57,403
What's up with him?

260
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:04,875
Since Anne has decided to
share our good news with you,

261
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:07,634
I won't hide anything.

262
00:28:11,474 --> 00:28:13,275
Are you happy now?

263
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:17,215
It's not very entertaining.

264
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,635
We receive shots of our house,

265
00:28:20,515 --> 00:28:24,515
apparently to show us
we're under surveillance.

266
00:28:25,075 --> 00:28:28,195
With all of Anne's comings-and-goings,
mine and Pierrot's...

267
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,556
- You've no idea who's filming and how?
- So far, no.

268
00:28:30,591 --> 00:28:33,236
- Let's see.
- Here you go.

269
00:28:55,077 --> 00:28:56,197
What's that?

270
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,918
The house where I grew up.

271
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,050
Do you need anything else?

272
00:29:40,085 --> 00:29:42,180
- No, run along.
- Very well.

273
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,340
Goodnight.

274
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,361
Don't just stand there.

275
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,100
Sit down.

276
00:29:56,642 --> 00:29:58,842
No need to look so gloomy.

277
00:30:00,082 --> 00:30:02,881
She's there just in case, that's all.

278
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:06,401
- I'm sorry.
- What for?

279
00:30:06,922 --> 00:30:09,922
- I didn't know...
- Stop that.

280
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:12,042
You're being ridiculous.

281
00:30:13,162 --> 00:30:15,683
Tell me how you're doing.

282
00:30:15,718 --> 00:30:17,162
Fine. I'm fine...

283
00:30:17,723 --> 00:30:20,562
Since we spoke on the
phone, nothing's changed.

284
00:30:20,597 --> 00:30:22,163
Pierrot's battling puberty.

285
00:30:23,002 --> 00:30:24,528
Anne's busy at her publisher's

286
00:30:24,563 --> 00:30:26,963
And me with the TV
program. That's about it.

287
00:30:29,564 --> 00:30:31,884
Aunt Julie wrote me a letter.

288
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:33,664
From Marseille.

289
00:30:34,803 --> 00:30:38,488
She never misses your show on TV.

290
00:30:38,523 --> 00:30:41,324
She says she envies me
having a son like you.

291
00:30:42,844 --> 00:30:43,944
That's nice.

292
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,544
She'll hit 80 this year.

293
00:30:48,225 --> 00:30:49,725
Really?

294
00:30:51,925 --> 00:30:53,025
What's wrong?

295
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:56,525
You look all pent up. What is it?

296
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,660
Nothing, I'm fine.

297
00:30:58,405 --> 00:31:01,005
I don't enjoy seeing you so unwell.

298
00:31:01,765 --> 00:31:03,566
What do you mean, "unwell?"

299
00:31:04,765 --> 00:31:07,010
For my age, I'm very well!

300
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:11,045
Don't bother me with nonsense like that.

301
00:31:11,646 --> 00:31:14,326
Isn't it lonely, if you can't go out?

302
00:31:14,361 --> 00:31:15,461
Why?

303
00:31:16,926 --> 00:31:20,926
Are you less lonely because
you can sit in the garden?

304
00:31:22,526 --> 00:31:26,526
Do you feel less lonely
in the Metro than at home?

305
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:29,307
Well then!

306
00:31:30,247 --> 00:31:32,767
Anyway, I have my family friend...

307
00:31:34,247 --> 00:31:36,368
With remote control.

308
00:31:37,048 --> 00:31:40,127
Whenever they annoy
me, I just shut them up.

309
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:48,248
I miss not hearing the piano.

310
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:51,088
Ever since your dad died.

311
00:31:53,008 --> 00:31:54,108
Do you still play?

312
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:57,049
No. I don't have time, you know.

313
00:31:57,688 --> 00:31:59,168
- Pity.
- Yes.

314
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:04,369
And Pierrot, is he gifted?

315
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:07,729
He's not interested.
He prefers to hang out.

316
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,809
He's 12 now, isn't he?

317
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:17,809
What brings you down here?

318
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:21,890
I'm going to Aix for a
special on François Weyergans.

319
00:32:22,165 --> 00:32:24,910
He's publishing a new
novel, his first in ages.

320
00:32:25,472 --> 00:32:26,572
Really?

321
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:29,910
You know who I had a dream about?

322
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,630
Majid

323
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,150
Who's Majid?

324
00:32:34,171 --> 00:32:35,650
You know! Majid!

325
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:37,551
You've lost me.

326
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,211
Majid! Hashem's son.

327
00:32:40,931 --> 00:32:43,412
The kid you planned to adopt!

328
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:44,711
I see.

329
00:32:45,612 --> 00:32:46,812
Odd, isn't it?

330
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:48,531
What's odd?

331
00:32:48,612 --> 00:32:50,132
After all those years.

332
00:32:51,212 --> 00:32:53,492
It's not all that odd.

333
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:56,613
I often dream of my childhood.

334
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:58,612
It comes with age.

335
00:32:58,813 --> 00:33:01,012
Sure, but I'm not that old.

336
00:33:02,252 --> 00:33:04,253
It comes faster than you think.

337
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:08,333
Do you ever think about him?

338
00:33:09,853 --> 00:33:10,953
About whom?

339
00:33:11,213 --> 00:33:12,313
Majid.

340
00:33:13,013 --> 00:33:14,413
- No.
- How come?

341
00:33:15,853 --> 00:33:17,174
"How come?"

342
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:20,419
How come you don't think about him ever?

343
00:33:20,454 --> 00:33:24,178
It was a big deal for
you and Dad at the time.

344
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:28,213
It was a long time ago.
And it's not a happy memory.

345
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:31,654
As you know only too well.

346
00:33:31,689 --> 00:33:32,789
Yeah.

347
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,460
What did you dream?

348
00:33:36,495 --> 00:33:38,936
Stupid stuff, but it
brought him back to mind.

349
00:33:38,971 --> 00:33:40,316
I'd forgotten all about him.

350
00:33:43,535 --> 00:33:44,635
What does Anne do?

351
00:33:45,655 --> 00:33:48,935
She's well. She still works
for the same publishers.

352
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,813
She runs her own schedule.

353
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,656
Her boss is a friend of ours.

354
00:33:52,691 --> 00:33:54,856
- Very handy.
- Yes.

355
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:59,256
I don't know what more I can
tell you. We hardly see each other

356
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:02,833
and when we do, I've
nothing special to tell you.

357
00:34:02,868 --> 00:34:06,376
Mostly, we chug along.
No great highs or lows.

358
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:08,656
I'm fine. Anne's fine.

359
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:10,622
Pierrot's fine.

360
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:13,782
As far as I can tell, at least.

361
00:34:13,817 --> 00:34:17,497
We're all very busy and that's about it.

362
00:34:17,897 --> 00:34:20,377
But I get the feeling you're not fine.

363
00:34:21,057 --> 00:34:23,377
You seem strange, Georges.

364
00:34:25,218 --> 00:34:28,218
Listening to you, I'm worried about you.

365
00:34:30,338 --> 00:34:31,738
What's going on?

366
00:34:32,298 --> 00:34:33,398
What do you mean?

367
00:34:34,538 --> 00:34:35,638
Come on...

368
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,018
No, seriously?

369
00:34:43,979 --> 00:34:45,624
When are you leaving?

370
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,379
Tomorrow morning. I
have to be in Aix by 12.

371
00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:52,019
You'll have to leave early then.

372
00:34:52,054 --> 00:34:53,154
Yes.

373
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,094
Shall I ask Mme Arnaud to
prepare breakfast for us?

374
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,900
You're up that early?

375
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,700
I don't sleep much now.

376
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,540
That's one of the benefits of old age.

377
00:35:10,621 --> 00:35:14,621
- I'm off to bed. I'm dead tired.
- Goodnight.

378
00:35:18,981 --> 00:35:21,101
Can I get you something?
You need anything?

379
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:22,541
No, I'm fine.

380
00:35:23,141 --> 00:35:25,541
I have all I need. Goodnight.

381
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:27,201
Goodnight, Mom.

382
00:35:29,382 --> 00:35:31,822
What time for breakfast?

383
00:35:31,857 --> 00:35:33,421
- 7 o'clock?
- OK.

384
00:35:34,302 --> 00:35:37,022
- Shall I tell her?
- Yes.

385
00:35:37,982 --> 00:35:39,082
Goodnight.

386
00:35:40,102 --> 00:35:41,623
- Light off?
- No.

387
00:35:47,383 --> 00:35:49,068
He's not a baby anymore.

388
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:51,623
I like not having him around some days.

389
00:35:51,658 --> 00:35:54,023
He can be a little macho prick.

390
00:35:56,663 --> 00:35:58,463
Yes, I wonder who he gets it from.

391
00:36:00,983 --> 00:36:02,383
When will you be home?

392
00:36:03,223 --> 00:36:05,103
Can't you pick him up at school?

393
00:36:05,138 --> 00:36:06,504
I can't tomorrow.

394
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,824
We have to pack up here.

395
00:36:09,104 --> 00:36:12,509
It was our last launch
in this fancy location.

396
00:36:12,544 --> 00:36:14,945
Yes, there are a lot of
people. It's swarming, in fact.

397
00:36:18,984 --> 00:36:20,184
Yes, I'll tell him.

398
00:36:23,105 --> 00:36:24,505
Love you too.

399
00:38:06,471 --> 00:38:08,272
Morning, mom.

400
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:18,275
There was a street sign.

401
00:39:38,757 --> 00:39:40,397
I can't make it out.

402
00:39:40,432 --> 00:39:41,532
Le...

403
00:39:42,077 --> 00:39:43,277
...nin, no?

404
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:48,398
- Avenue Lenin?
- Yes, Avenue Lenin.

405
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:49,642
But where?

406
00:39:49,677 --> 00:39:51,278
Do you have the map?

407
00:39:51,817 --> 00:39:52,917
Hold on.

408
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:06,558
Romain... Romainville.

409
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:10,958
Could be Romainville. See
if there's an Avenue Lenin.

410
00:40:11,074 --> 00:40:12,174
Hold on.

411
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:14,139
Found it!

412
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:18,440
Near Mairie des Lilas
Metro station. Line 11.

413
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:19,999
Right there.

414
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,119
So what are you going to do?

415
00:40:27,154 --> 00:40:28,254
Go over there.

416
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,840
It's near Guillaume's place.

417
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,405
- And?
- Nothing, I'll go over...

418
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,961
knock on the door,
and see what happens...

419
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,885
As simple as that?

420
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,801
As simple as that. Got a better idea?

421
00:40:42,836 --> 00:40:44,526
Why not the police?

422
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:47,441
We got the hallway, the street.
You should go with a cop.

423
00:40:47,476 --> 00:40:49,446
They can do that much, no?

424
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:52,001
What if it's a bluff, a practical joke?

425
00:40:52,441 --> 00:40:53,641
You think so? Seriously?

426
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:56,641
What does the tape show?

427
00:40:57,122 --> 00:41:00,402
A street and a low-rent
hallway. They'll just tell me...

428
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,962
"Try knocking on the door

429
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:07,041
"and if someone tries to
kill you come see us again."

430
00:41:07,597 --> 00:41:10,163
Who would know the
house where you grew up?

431
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:12,702
I don't know.

432
00:41:15,002 --> 00:41:17,003
Do you recognize the building?

433
00:41:17,038 --> 00:41:18,138
No.

434
00:41:18,763 --> 00:41:20,083
Right, well...

435
00:41:22,963 --> 00:41:25,043
we'll hire a private detective.

436
00:41:25,644 --> 00:41:28,723
You watch too many crime shows.

437
00:41:28,843 --> 00:41:32,444
You're impossible to
talk to. Do it your way.

438
00:41:33,923 --> 00:41:36,203
- I have a hunch.
- What?

439
00:41:36,238 --> 00:41:38,484
I think I know who it is.

440
00:41:41,044 --> 00:41:42,324
You know who it is?

441
00:41:43,524 --> 00:41:44,924
<i>I think I know.</i>

442
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,145
So?

443
00:41:48,324 --> 00:41:50,244
So I have to make sure.

444
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,370
Whoa, what's wrong with you?

445
00:41:54,405 --> 00:41:57,365
Maybe you could share
your solitary wisdom.

446
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,365
This concerns me too, you know?

447
00:42:00,445 --> 00:42:04,445
I can't tell you because I don't know.

448
00:42:04,881 --> 00:42:06,646
It's just a hunch.

449
00:42:08,246 --> 00:42:09,926
You can't tell me about it?

450
00:42:11,926 --> 00:42:13,026
Non.

451
00:42:17,806 --> 00:42:18,906
Wow...

452
00:42:19,527 --> 00:42:21,047
I don't know what I...

453
00:42:22,086 --> 00:42:23,766
Do you realize what you're saying?

454
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:25,447
Please, it's not what you think.

455
00:42:25,487 --> 00:42:26,967
And what do I think?

456
00:42:27,887 --> 00:42:29,167
Will you cut it out?

457
00:42:29,202 --> 00:42:30,412
It's a vague hunch.

458
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:33,167
I don't want to alarm
anyone before I know more.

459
00:42:33,202 --> 00:42:34,605
It is not your concern.

460
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,008
It's not my concern?

461
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:38,488
I guess I dreamt it all!

462
00:42:40,408 --> 00:42:44,408
I thought it was my concern being
terrorized by anonymous calls

463
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:46,893
and these fucking videos!

464
00:42:46,928 --> 00:42:49,849
Being almost too scared to go out!

465
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:52,694
Not my concern to lie awake all night

466
00:42:52,729 --> 00:42:55,969
worrying about Pierrot
and you and all this crap?

467
00:42:56,004 --> 00:42:56,968
If it's not my concern

468
00:42:56,969 --> 00:42:59,089
then it's business as usual.
Would you like something to eat?

469
00:42:59,124 --> 00:43:00,889
Or maybe I can get you a drink?

470
00:43:01,969 --> 00:43:03,809
Anne, please, if I had known...

471
00:43:03,844 --> 00:43:04,970
What would you have done?

472
00:43:05,005 --> 00:43:07,170
Kept your trap shut?

473
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:08,328
Please...

474
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:10,730
Do you realize the
bullshit you're talking?

475
00:43:10,765 --> 00:43:14,010
You've never heard of trust?

476
00:43:14,169 --> 00:43:17,810
You realize you're doing
exactly what this guy wants?

477
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,027
He wants to throw our lives upside down.

478
00:43:20,062 --> 00:43:22,210
You're reacting exactly as he wants.

479
00:43:22,245 --> 00:43:23,728
Can't you just trust me?

480
00:43:23,763 --> 00:43:25,211
I have to trust you?

481
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:28,496
Why not the other way around for once?

482
00:43:28,531 --> 00:43:30,531
How about you trust me? Who's
refusing to give trust here?

483
00:43:33,131 --> 00:43:35,211
Imagine the shoe's on the other foot.

484
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:37,056
Imagine I say...

485
00:43:37,091 --> 00:43:39,971
"I have an idea who's terrorizing
us but I can't tell you."

486
00:43:40,006 --> 00:43:41,106
Great, no?

487
00:43:42,451 --> 00:43:45,012
That's your idea of
a working relationship

488
00:43:45,047 --> 00:43:47,932
"based on mutual trust?"

489
00:43:51,132 --> 00:43:53,386
You should hear yourself.

490
00:44:47,855 --> 00:44:48,975
Just a second!

491
00:44:50,376 --> 00:44:51,476
I'm coming!

492
00:44:59,856 --> 00:45:02,176
Sorry, I was in the middle of...

493
00:45:05,657 --> 00:45:07,657
Look who it is!

494
00:45:08,657 --> 00:45:09,937
Who are you?

495
00:45:12,537 --> 00:45:13,857
You wanna come in?

496
00:45:27,818 --> 00:45:28,918
After you.

497
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:45,359
Have a seat.

498
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:51,504
I was making lunch.

499
00:45:51,539 --> 00:45:53,059
What do you want from me?

500
00:45:55,379 --> 00:45:56,780
What do I want? Me?

501
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,160
Do you want money?

502
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:59,760
Money?

503
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,300
What then?

504
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,500
Do you mind telling me how you found me?

505
00:46:14,741 --> 00:46:16,021
It's a game, is that it?

506
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:17,261
I don't want to play.

507
00:46:17,296 --> 00:46:18,252
I've grown up.

508
00:46:18,253 --> 00:46:19,353
I see that.

509
00:46:19,901 --> 00:46:22,502
So, what's the point of your actions?

510
00:46:22,537 --> 00:46:23,906
What actions?

511
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:25,342
Are you making fun of me?

512
00:46:27,222 --> 00:46:30,622
Do you mind telling me why you're here?

513
00:46:31,502 --> 00:46:34,182
How did you find me?

514
00:46:42,503 --> 00:46:43,783
What's this?

515
00:46:43,818 --> 00:46:45,063
Don't play dumb.

516
00:46:57,263 --> 00:46:58,363
Well?

517
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,144
Sit down, please.

518
00:47:18,665 --> 00:47:21,965
You may not believe I wasn't
expecting you. But it's true.

519
00:47:23,185 --> 00:47:26,186
You're the last person I
would expect at my door.

520
00:47:28,425 --> 00:47:32,085
Right. I'll play along
to see where it gets us.

521
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,593
I could also report you
to the police quite simply.

522
00:47:35,628 --> 00:47:39,066
So, you had no idea and
you're surprised to see me.

523
00:47:39,946 --> 00:47:41,831
Who do you think drew me here?

524
00:47:41,866 --> 00:47:44,667
Who's been terrorizing
my family for weeks?

525
00:47:44,702 --> 00:47:45,802
I don't know.

526
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:47,947
Why do you talk like we're strangers?

527
00:47:51,467 --> 00:47:53,387
You wouldn't have recognized me, huh?

528
00:47:54,307 --> 00:47:56,907
Out in the street, you'd
have walked right past me.

529
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,672
At first, I wasn't sure either.

530
00:48:01,707 --> 00:48:04,987
When I tuned into your show by chance

531
00:48:05,308 --> 00:48:06,828
a few years ago...

532
00:48:07,587 --> 00:48:10,567
The show with the two
chairs stuck together...

533
00:48:10,602 --> 00:48:13,548
You sat up close to your
guests, face to face...

534
00:48:15,188 --> 00:48:18,074
I wasn't sure either.

535
00:48:18,109 --> 00:48:21,109
I just had a nasty feeling in my gut.

536
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:24,509
Weird, no?

537
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:28,109
I felt nauseous and I didn't know why.

538
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:34,429
When your name finally came
up, I began to understand.

539
00:48:34,905 --> 00:48:36,470
And then... the nose.

540
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:48,480
How did you wind up on TV? You
didn't take over the estate?

541
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:51,790
Tell me what you want.

542
00:48:53,071 --> 00:48:54,171
Nothing.

543
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:55,931
Nothing.

544
00:48:57,151 --> 00:48:59,631
What could I want from
you? What do you imagine?

545
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:00,766
Money?

546
00:49:03,111 --> 00:49:07,111
You barge in here accusing
me of trying to blackmail you.

547
00:49:10,192 --> 00:49:12,392
You haven't changed.

548
00:49:12,912 --> 00:49:15,792
What could I blackmail you with?

549
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,872
Who sent me the tapes?

550
00:49:18,907 --> 00:49:20,007
The tapes?

551
00:49:23,273 --> 00:49:27,073
Strange. I haven't gotten into
a fight since I was a child.

552
00:49:27,108 --> 00:49:29,553
I find it repugnant.

553
00:49:32,193 --> 00:49:33,293
And right now...

554
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,273
if you don't stop this stupid game...

555
00:49:36,308 --> 00:49:37,873
You'll kick my ass?

556
00:49:39,073 --> 00:49:40,353
That shouldn't be hard.

557
00:49:40,834 --> 00:49:44,114
You're a lot bigger than the last time.

558
00:49:44,474 --> 00:49:48,474
Kicking my ass won't leave
you any wiser about me.

559
00:49:49,714 --> 00:49:53,174
Even if you beat me to death.

560
00:49:53,209 --> 00:49:56,599
But you're too refined for that.

561
00:49:56,634 --> 00:50:00,234
Above all, you have too much to lose.

562
00:50:01,314 --> 00:50:02,774
What are you saying?

563
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:04,235
That's not true?

564
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:06,535
I think it is.

565
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:11,875
What wouldn't we do
not to lose what's ours?

566
00:50:16,516 --> 00:50:18,916
You were older and stronger than me.

567
00:50:18,951 --> 00:50:20,716
I had no choice.

568
00:50:21,916 --> 00:50:23,016
Right, then.

569
00:50:28,277 --> 00:50:30,877
Your mom's sick?

570
00:50:30,917 --> 00:50:32,036
Where do you get that from?

571
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:34,397
It's not hard to guess, is it?

572
00:50:36,477 --> 00:50:38,357
What do you want? Revenge?

573
00:50:42,877 --> 00:50:45,077
She was a very kind lady.

574
00:50:46,477 --> 00:50:49,158
I was very grateful to her, you know.

575
00:50:50,118 --> 00:50:52,918
To your father, too.

576
00:50:53,557 --> 00:50:55,158
I'm going to leave now.

577
00:50:56,278 --> 00:50:58,879
If you try again to
interfere in my life,

578
00:50:58,914 --> 00:50:59,917
to scare my family

579
00:50:59,918 --> 00:51:01,338
or to hurt me in any way

580
00:51:01,373 --> 00:51:02,758
you'll regret it, I swear.

581
00:51:03,279 --> 00:51:04,379
You're threatening me?

582
00:51:04,879 --> 00:51:05,979
Yes, I'm threatening you.

583
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:08,559
Believe me, I mean it.

584
00:51:08,594 --> 00:51:09,694
I believe you.

585
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:12,999
But you don't believe me.

586
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:15,559
I didn't want anything from you.

587
00:51:16,399 --> 00:51:19,479
And I never sent you a
tape or anything else.

588
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,879
Not this either.

589
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,720
I'm glad you came.

590
00:52:55,925 --> 00:52:57,126
Yes, hello

591
00:52:57,646 --> 00:53:00,885
This is Georges Laurent.
Could I speak to my wife?

592
00:53:01,166 --> 00:53:02,266
Thank you.

593
00:53:04,846 --> 00:53:06,126
Hi, it's me.

594
00:53:06,606 --> 00:53:10,287
I went there. Nobody was in.

595
00:53:11,247 --> 00:53:13,567
No, it was just a door like any other.

596
00:53:14,687 --> 00:53:16,607
It was locked.

597
00:53:19,207 --> 00:53:20,527
I did.

598
00:53:20,687 --> 00:53:23,972
He said it was unoccupied.

599
00:53:24,007 --> 00:53:28,007
It must be a storeroom
or something like that.

600
00:54:05,769 --> 00:54:07,969
<i>She was a very kind lady.</i>

601
00:54:08,969 --> 00:54:11,649
<i>I was very grateful to her, you know.</i>

602
00:54:12,329 --> 00:54:15,129
<i>To your father, too.</i>

603
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,769
<i>I'm going to leave now, but
you can be sure of something.</i>

604
00:54:17,649 --> 00:54:21,649
<i>If you try again to
interfere in my life,</i>

605
00:54:22,809 --> 00:54:24,054
<i>to scare my family</i>

606
00:54:24,089 --> 00:54:25,469
<i>or to hurt me in any way,</i>

607
00:54:25,504 --> 00:54:26,716
<i>you'll regret it, I swear.</i>

608
00:54:26,751 --> 00:54:27,929
<i>You're threatening me?</i>

609
00:54:28,049 --> 00:54:29,169
<i>Yes, I'm threatening you.</i>

610
00:54:30,088 --> 00:54:31,889
<i>Believe me, I mean it.</i>

611
00:54:31,924 --> 00:54:33,024
<i>I believe you.</i>

612
00:54:33,608 --> 00:54:35,889
<i>But you don't believe me.</i>

613
00:54:36,169 --> 00:54:38,448
<i>I didn't want anything from you.</i>

614
00:54:39,248 --> 00:54:42,368
<i>And I never sent you a
tape or anything else.</i>

615
00:54:45,568 --> 00:54:46,848
<i>Not this either.</i>

616
00:54:51,128 --> 00:54:53,808
<i>I'm glad you came.</i>

617
00:55:50,804 --> 00:55:52,304
That's it.

618
00:55:55,237 --> 00:55:58,037
The tape runs for another hour
if you want to watch how he feels.

619
00:56:11,325 --> 00:56:12,359
I'm sorry.

620
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,460
What for?

621
00:56:18,524 --> 00:56:19,624
What now?

622
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:25,284
I know. It was dumb of me
to lie to you. I apologize.

623
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:26,604
I don't get it.

624
00:56:26,804 --> 00:56:27,763
I'm sorry!

625
00:56:27,764 --> 00:56:31,089
I don't get how you see things.

626
00:56:31,124 --> 00:56:34,604
You say "sorry" and just like
that everything's okay, right?

627
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:37,729
Am I supposed to beg? What
did I do that's so awful?

628
00:56:37,764 --> 00:56:41,764
I only lied to spare you more stress.
Has the world stopped spinning?

629
00:56:44,964 --> 00:56:46,064
I'm sorry.

630
00:56:50,804 --> 00:56:54,804
I suspected it was him. Not at first
but after the tape of Mom's house.

631
00:56:55,198 --> 00:56:58,163
I didn't want you to deal with this.

632
00:57:00,803 --> 00:57:02,648
His parents worked for us.

633
00:57:02,683 --> 00:57:06,603
Dad liked them. They must
have been good workers.

634
00:57:07,803 --> 00:57:11,803
In October '61, the FLN called all
Algerians to a demonstration in Paris.

635
00:57:13,478 --> 00:57:15,922
October 17, 1961. Enough said.

636
00:57:16,962 --> 00:57:18,847
Papon. The police massacre.

637
00:57:18,882 --> 00:57:21,063
They drowned about
200 Arabs in the Seine

638
00:57:22,162 --> 00:57:25,123
including Majid's parents most likely.

639
00:57:25,158 --> 00:57:27,242
They never came back.

640
00:57:27,763 --> 00:57:30,442
Dad went to Paris to look for them.

641
00:57:30,643 --> 00:57:34,643
They said he should be glad to
be rid of a couple of jigaboos.

642
00:57:37,682 --> 00:57:38,782
And then?

643
00:57:39,282 --> 00:57:40,382
And then...

644
00:57:41,882 --> 00:57:44,482
My parents decided to adopt the boy.

645
00:57:44,517 --> 00:57:45,962
I don't know why.

646
00:57:47,561 --> 00:57:51,561
They felt responsible in some way.

647
00:57:52,921 --> 00:57:54,021
So...

648
00:57:54,161 --> 00:57:56,282
It bothered me. I didn't
want him in our house.

649
00:57:56,317 --> 00:57:57,280
He had his own room.

650
00:57:57,281 --> 00:58:00,521
I had to share, you see. I was 6!

651
00:58:04,201 --> 00:58:05,601
So what did you do?

652
00:58:06,601 --> 00:58:07,701
Nothing...

653
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:10,121
I told lies about him.

654
00:58:10,241 --> 00:58:12,360
You told lies about him?

655
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,200
That's all?

656
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,241
That's why he wants revenge?

657
00:58:21,276 --> 00:58:22,640
Apparently.

658
00:58:28,241 --> 00:58:29,440
You threatened him.

659
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,480
Not a particularly intelligent move.

660
00:58:32,515 --> 00:58:33,879
Not particularly intelligent?

661
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,680
Stupid. I know. I was out of my depth.

662
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,080
I don't think he's lying.

663
00:58:42,115 --> 00:58:43,215
What do you mean?

664
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:45,059
He was genuinely surprised.

665
00:58:45,094 --> 00:58:46,760
- But the tape?
- Which one?

666
00:58:46,795 --> 00:58:48,605
You think it's staged?

667
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,724
He'd have to be awfully cunning.

668
00:58:51,759 --> 00:58:54,279
Who else could it be?
I can't read his mind.

669
00:58:54,759 --> 00:58:57,359
Why send this thing to us?

670
00:58:57,399 --> 00:59:00,159
To keep me informed. Unlike you.

671
00:59:00,194 --> 00:59:01,599
So who sent the other tapes?

672
00:59:01,634 --> 00:59:03,399
How should I know?

673
00:59:08,479 --> 00:59:11,119
What kind of lies did you tell?

674
00:59:11,154 --> 00:59:12,399
I can't remember.

675
00:59:13,158 --> 00:59:15,839
The usual stuff kids lie about.

676
00:59:16,278 --> 00:59:18,598
Things you make up. Stupid stuff.

677
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:23,657
- Well?
- Well what?

678
00:59:23,914 --> 00:59:25,483
Stop acting like an idiot!

679
00:59:25,518 --> 00:59:27,958
If you'd accused him of
stealing a teddy bear,

680
00:59:27,993 --> 00:59:29,398
he wouldn't want revenge 40 years later.

681
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:31,078
I don't remember!

682
00:59:34,478 --> 00:59:36,678
You don't want to tell me, you mean?

683
00:59:36,713 --> 00:59:38,878
Ferchrissakes, what more do you want!?

684
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:40,522
I have no idea anymore.

685
00:59:40,557 --> 00:59:44,557
<i>Do you remember stupid stuff
you did when you were 6?</i>

686
00:59:48,998 --> 00:59:51,477
What happened to him?

687
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:55,282
He was sent away. He was sick.

688
00:59:55,317 --> 00:59:58,217
To a hospital, or a
children's home, I don't know.

689
00:59:58,957 --> 01:00:01,081
One day he was gone, and I was glad.

690
01:00:01,116 --> 01:00:03,566
And then I forgot all about
it. That's natural, no?

691
01:00:07,197 --> 01:00:08,676
And your parents?

692
01:00:09,636 --> 01:00:11,156
Forgot it too, I suppose.

693
01:00:11,436 --> 01:00:14,276
It was only an interlude
of a few months.

694
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:15,411
An interlude?

695
01:00:15,516 --> 01:00:16,997
What should I call it? A tragedy?

696
01:00:18,116 --> 01:00:20,516
Maybe it was a tragedy. I don't know.

697
01:00:20,551 --> 01:00:22,236
I don't feel responsible for it.

698
01:00:22,271 --> 01:00:23,881
Why should I?

699
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:26,436
It's all so absurd.

700
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:30,476
You mentioned it to your
mother when you visited?

701
01:00:30,511 --> 01:00:31,611
Sure.

702
01:00:31,876 --> 01:00:35,356
Ah, I see there's at
least someone you trust.

703
01:00:35,391 --> 01:00:37,036
Jesus! She knows about him already.

704
01:00:37,071 --> 01:00:40,235
I didn't mention the tapes.

705
01:00:40,316 --> 01:00:41,796
Well, what did she say?

706
01:00:42,756 --> 01:00:43,856
Nothing.

707
01:00:45,956 --> 01:00:48,595
She's getting old. She can't remember.

708
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:50,675
Or doesn't want to. I don't know.

709
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:53,155
It's unpleasant for her.

710
01:01:14,634 --> 01:01:17,234
Thanks for coming so
quickly. How is it going?

711
01:01:17,269 --> 01:01:18,153
Great thanks. And you?

712
01:01:18,154 --> 01:01:20,954
Busy as always, you know what it's like.

713
01:01:21,314 --> 01:01:22,715
Please, take a seat.

714
01:01:25,714 --> 01:01:28,874
How's your wife? I
haven't seen her for ages.

715
01:01:28,909 --> 01:01:30,039
She's very well.

716
01:01:30,074 --> 01:01:34,074
They just published a translation
of Pereira's book on globalization.

717
01:01:34,868 --> 01:01:36,519
She fought for it, and it's a bit hit.

718
01:01:36,554 --> 01:01:40,113
Great, I must buy it, but you know
how it is. One can never find the time.

719
01:01:40,313 --> 01:01:41,754
Please give her my regards.

720
01:01:41,789 --> 01:01:42,889
Of course. Thank you.

721
01:01:43,873 --> 01:01:44,633
Coffee?

722
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:46,113
No, thanks. I've already too much today.

723
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:53,279
I'll get right to it. You
probably think I asked you up

724
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:56,639
to talk about the
concept for your new show.

725
01:01:57,713 --> 01:01:59,478
That'll have to wait.

726
01:01:59,513 --> 01:02:03,033
The Head of Programming won't
decide anything before summer.

727
01:02:03,068 --> 01:02:05,270
The decision was due by May 15.

728
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:07,437
I know, but what can I say?

729
01:02:07,472 --> 01:02:11,322
The Lord works in mysterious
ways. Public TV even more so.

730
01:02:11,872 --> 01:02:15,472
I wouldn't worry. We always
bring them around, don't we?

731
01:02:15,552 --> 01:02:18,792
- May God hear you!
- Sadly, polytheism reigns here.

732
01:02:18,827 --> 01:02:21,472
But as I said, don't
worry. It'll all work out.

733
01:02:21,672 --> 01:02:23,872
With your prestige and
your loyal viewership!

734
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:25,007
Yeah, sure.

735
01:02:26,392 --> 01:02:29,972
Anyway... I asked you up
because of a silly thing

736
01:02:30,007 --> 01:02:33,552
that to be honest makes
me a little uncomfortable.

737
01:02:34,112 --> 01:02:37,317
Yesterday, my secretary
left a tape on my desk.

738
01:02:37,352 --> 01:02:40,111
It was addressed to
me but without a note.

739
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:43,000
Usually, she wouldn't even
show me something like that.

740
01:02:43,035 --> 01:02:45,650
She'd just take a quick look
and toss it in the trash.

741
01:02:46,232 --> 01:02:50,191
I've no interest in the
crap your fan club sends in.

742
01:02:50,226 --> 01:02:51,718
But she thought I should see this.

743
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:55,990
The tape shows you having
a private conversation

744
01:02:56,025 --> 01:02:57,991
with a man in a kind of flat.

745
01:02:58,431 --> 01:03:02,431
The subject isn't apparent plus
I didn't want to be indiscreet.

746
01:03:02,905 --> 01:03:05,417
But you clearly had no
idea you were being filmed.

747
01:03:06,671 --> 01:03:09,430
I wanted to ask you if
you knew what it was.

748
01:03:09,465 --> 01:03:11,550
And, if you do, what you think.

749
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:15,999
I'm sorry you got dragged into this.

750
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:19,003
The guy's the son of Algerian farmhands

751
01:03:19,038 --> 01:03:21,217
who worked for my parents around 1960.

752
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:25,395
He has a pathological
hatred of my family

753
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:28,350
and he tries to hurt me
with this stuff. Sorry.

754
01:03:29,469 --> 01:03:33,390
That's okay. It can't
be very pleasant for you.

755
01:03:33,425 --> 01:03:34,834
You've been to the police?

756
01:03:34,869 --> 01:03:38,869
Sure, but they course won't do anything,
as long as nothing "dramatic" happens.

757
01:03:39,544 --> 01:03:42,449
Apparently, this guy's
out to wreck your career.

758
01:03:43,389 --> 01:03:45,469
God knows where else he sent the tape.

759
01:03:45,504 --> 01:03:46,604
That's true.

760
01:03:50,669 --> 01:03:53,349
Why is he so bitter?

761
01:03:53,389 --> 01:03:57,359
Sorry to pry but he didn't
appear very aggressive.

762
01:03:58,069 --> 01:04:01,314
Yes, I know. I'm the
aggressive one on the tape.

763
01:04:01,349 --> 01:04:05,349
My visit was the consequence
of his campaign of terror.

764
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:08,958
My wife and I are
very worried naturally.

765
01:04:09,228 --> 01:04:10,348
I imagine.

766
01:04:11,068 --> 01:04:13,728
You have no idea what's driving him?

767
01:04:15,068 --> 01:04:16,168
None at all.

768
01:04:16,748 --> 01:04:20,267
Apparently, he's convinced my
family and I mistreated him.

769
01:04:20,302 --> 01:04:23,787
In fact, the last time I
saw him, I was 6. He's crazy.

770
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:29,588
You have my sympathy. This is awful.

771
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:32,992
I hope it's resolved soon.

772
01:04:33,027 --> 01:04:35,927
It would be unfortunate
if news of this leaked out.

773
01:04:37,547 --> 01:04:40,568
I know. I'll put a lawyer on the case.

774
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:43,307
Do it. Good idea.

775
01:04:43,987 --> 01:04:47,587
Don't worry about the new
show. I'll stay on top of it.

776
01:04:47,622 --> 01:04:48,722
Great, thanks.

777
01:04:49,187 --> 01:04:51,267
Not at all. It's my fight too.
You know how highly I think of you.

778
01:04:51,302 --> 01:04:53,347
Thank you. Can I have the tape?

779
01:04:53,382 --> 01:04:54,482
The tape?

780
01:04:54,506 --> 01:04:57,672
Ah, the tape. I
destroyed it immediately.

781
01:04:57,707 --> 01:04:59,307
I didn't want it to fall
into the wrong hands.

782
01:04:59,342 --> 01:05:00,442
I see.

783
01:05:00,787 --> 01:05:02,653
You'd have done the same, no?

784
01:05:58,265 --> 01:05:59,365
Open up.

785
01:06:02,345 --> 01:06:03,445
Open up!

786
01:06:07,144 --> 01:06:08,424
Come on, open up!

787
01:06:09,184 --> 01:06:11,304
Open the damn door!

788
01:06:20,052 --> 01:06:21,357
What do you think he should have done?

789
01:06:21,504 --> 01:06:22,904
What should he have done?

790
01:06:23,304 --> 01:06:24,984
Are you kidding?

791
01:06:25,743 --> 01:06:28,824
You'd have bullshitted
Mathilde like that?

792
01:06:29,863 --> 01:06:33,383
People talk to each other, don't they?

793
01:06:36,463 --> 01:06:37,663
Calm down.

794
01:06:39,183 --> 01:06:41,703
Calm down. It's okay.

795
01:06:42,943 --> 01:06:44,143
Calm down.

796
01:07:09,302 --> 01:07:11,902
Time to get back to the office.

797
01:07:12,502 --> 01:07:13,602
Yes.

798
01:07:14,222 --> 01:07:18,222
<i>But the Governor of Nassiriyah province,
an Italian appointed by the Americans</i>

799
01:07:18,697 --> 01:07:20,666
<i>Barbara Contini,</i>

800
01:07:20,701 --> 01:07:23,186
<i>demands greater openness on the subject.</i>

801
01:07:23,221 --> 01:07:27,221
<i>The Italians come under British
command as the official occupying power.</i>

802
01:07:30,856 --> 01:07:34,856
<i>It's vital all coalition countries
that have joined in this mission</i>

803
01:07:35,656 --> 01:07:39,621
<i>operate under the same
rules of engagement.</i>

804
01:07:42,095 --> 01:07:46,095
<i>This will result in greater
homogeneity and better coordination.</i>

805
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:53,581
<i>Ultimately, Italian President Ciampi...</i>

806
01:07:53,616 --> 01:07:54,981
About time.

807
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:58,180
Where have you been?

808
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,505
I ate out with Pierre.

809
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:04,199
Without telling me? Why
switch off your cell phone?

810
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:05,360
Why?

811
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,985
Do you tell me everything you do?

812
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:11,800
- Let's not start that again.
- Exactly.

813
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:16,419
Pierrot's already in bed?

814
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,465
I thought he was with you.

815
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,501
With me? You know I was at work, no?

816
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:28,617
He was going over to Yves' after school.

817
01:08:30,299 --> 01:08:31,899
You have his number?

818
01:08:37,099 --> 01:08:40,231
He was going to swim
practice at 5 with Yves

819
01:08:40,579 --> 01:08:43,579
and Yves' dad was picking them up.

820
01:09:01,458 --> 01:09:04,023
Hello, this is Anne Laurent.

821
01:09:04,058 --> 01:09:06,738
I wanted to ask if you've seen Pierrot.

822
01:09:13,258 --> 01:09:14,358
Really?

823
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:16,558
Did he say anything?

824
01:09:20,617 --> 01:09:23,418
Yes, if you don't mind,
can I talk to him in person?

825
01:09:27,978 --> 01:09:29,502
Hi, Yves.

826
01:09:29,537 --> 01:09:32,817
Did Pierrot tell you where he was going?

827
01:09:34,257 --> 01:09:35,457
No, that's the point.

828
01:09:42,097 --> 01:09:43,896
Were you doing anything after?

829
01:09:46,136 --> 01:09:47,937
Did you have a fight?

830
01:09:48,616 --> 01:09:50,663
No, I don't know... Okay, I see.

831
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:52,976
If you hear anything,
can you give us a call?

832
01:09:53,011 --> 01:09:54,577
You have our number?

833
01:09:55,176 --> 01:09:58,256
Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

834
01:09:59,296 --> 01:10:01,696
He left Yves' house around 6:30.

835
01:10:02,176 --> 01:10:05,776
He said he'd be away with
us for the Ascension weekend.

836
01:10:09,815 --> 01:10:12,616
I'll go look in his room.

837
01:10:55,094 --> 01:10:56,194
Well?

838
01:10:57,694 --> 01:10:58,814
I don't know.

839
01:11:35,533 --> 01:11:37,453
We have to call the police.

840
01:11:37,653 --> 01:11:39,773
What if something's happened to him?

841
01:11:39,808 --> 01:11:41,293
- What?
- I don't know.

842
01:11:41,373 --> 01:11:43,772
What if he's been hit by a car or...

843
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:34,091
Open up, Police!

844
01:12:37,331 --> 01:12:38,431
Open up!

845
01:12:39,011 --> 01:12:40,111
Yes?

846
01:12:41,891 --> 01:12:43,691
- What's going on?
- Where's the boy?

847
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:44,662
What boy?

848
01:12:44,663 --> 01:12:45,763
Is that him?

849
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,340
Any sign of him?

850
01:12:54,890 --> 01:12:57,009
I'm going with them to the station.

851
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:00,090
I have no idea.

852
01:13:02,369 --> 01:13:03,469
He has a son.

853
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:07,840
It must have been him
who made the tapes.

854
01:13:09,689 --> 01:13:12,907
They claim they don't
even know who Pierrot is.

855
01:13:15,889 --> 01:13:17,679
No, they only looked for Pierrot.

856
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:20,579
They're investigating
kidnapping, not the tapes.

857
01:13:22,809 --> 01:13:24,489
Did anyone call?

858
01:13:25,969 --> 01:13:28,011
I was just asking, you never know.

859
01:13:29,889 --> 01:13:32,819
I have to go. Call me
if there's any news.

860
01:13:33,329 --> 01:13:34,768
Of course.

861
01:14:34,686 --> 01:14:36,486
You'd better go home now.

862
01:14:37,247 --> 01:14:39,812
You have an early flight tomorrow...

863
01:14:39,847 --> 01:14:42,611
Don't worry. I packed
yesterday. You know me...

864
01:14:42,646 --> 01:14:46,406
You've been really sweet
but I prefer to be alone now.

865
01:14:46,441 --> 01:14:48,446
On your own, you'll imagine the worst.

866
01:14:48,481 --> 01:14:49,581
Pierre...

867
01:14:49,766 --> 01:14:51,286
Come on, let's on.

868
01:14:54,086 --> 01:14:55,686
If you need anything, just call.

869
01:14:58,326 --> 01:15:00,006
- Promise?
- Yes.

870
01:15:10,365 --> 01:15:11,885
You can call any time.

871
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,206
Thanks, I know.

872
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:15,685
Corsica isn't another planet.

873
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:16,820
See you, my dear.

874
01:15:18,285 --> 01:15:20,285
- Well?
- No news.

875
01:15:21,965 --> 01:15:25,325
It probably wasn't an accident.
No reports from the hospitals.

876
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,404
And the two guys?

877
01:15:26,405 --> 01:15:28,805
They claim they don't know him.

878
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,102
What about the tapes?

879
01:15:30,137 --> 01:15:31,329
They both deny it.

880
01:15:31,364 --> 01:15:34,285
Look, just drop it. The
police aren't interested...

881
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,449
...in anything other than kidnapping.

882
01:15:36,023 --> 01:15:38,497
For the tapes, we need proof.
They'll look into it, but

883
01:15:38,697 --> 01:15:42,204
there's a procedure to be
followed. File a report, lawyer

884
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:44,605
The cops don't care if it's linked.

885
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,924
So they released them?

886
01:15:46,084 --> 01:15:47,689
Don't you want to come in?

887
01:15:47,724 --> 01:15:49,349
- We're just leaving.
- We'd be in the way.

888
01:15:49,384 --> 01:15:51,448
Nonsense! Come on in...

889
01:15:51,483 --> 01:15:55,483
I asked them to go. I was
exhausted and wanted to be alone.

890
01:15:56,963 --> 01:15:58,164
I'm sorry.

891
01:16:00,403 --> 01:16:04,244
All this is... It makes me sick.

892
01:16:04,923 --> 01:16:06,643
No, they kept them in custody.

893
01:16:07,244 --> 01:16:10,913
The kid started yelling.
So they locked him up.

894
01:16:10,948 --> 01:16:13,667
That got his dad started...

895
01:16:13,668 --> 01:16:16,637
So now they're both in
the cage for the night.

896
01:16:16,923 --> 01:16:18,763
- And then?
- Then they'll let them go.

897
01:16:18,798 --> 01:16:21,087
If there's no proof, they have to.

898
01:16:21,088 --> 01:16:23,288
There's suspicion, nothing more.

899
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:25,763
What will you do now?

900
01:16:26,163 --> 01:16:30,163
Now, I'm going to grab some
food. I haven't eaten all day.

901
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:02,280
What the hell got into you?

902
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,284
I'm sorry.

903
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:07,520
Anne Laurent... Thank you very much.

904
01:18:07,555 --> 01:18:08,764
Come in, please.

905
01:18:08,799 --> 01:18:11,524
No, thanks. I'm badly parked.

906
01:18:11,559 --> 01:18:15,559
I called my husband, who's also
delighted and says thank you.

907
01:18:15,634 --> 01:18:17,177
It's the least I could do.

908
01:18:17,212 --> 01:18:18,384
Please come in.

909
01:18:18,419 --> 01:18:21,838
No, I have to go. I just wanted
to be sure he really came home.

910
01:18:21,873 --> 01:18:22,973
What do you mean?

911
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:25,519
I owe you an apology. I...

912
01:18:25,554 --> 01:18:26,654
Whatever for?

913
01:18:26,798 --> 01:18:29,078
I work nights at the hospital.

914
01:18:29,113 --> 01:18:31,084
So I'm not always around.

915
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:35,119
When François has friends over...
Well, we're pretty laidback.

916
01:18:36,798 --> 01:18:39,798
I didn't know your son hadn't
called. I got in at 7...

917
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:42,800
Oh, it's okay. It's not your fault if...

918
01:18:43,718 --> 01:18:44,998
You're sure you won't come in?

919
01:18:45,033 --> 01:18:46,398
Thank you, no.

920
01:18:47,438 --> 01:18:51,185
I don't know how... to
express my gratitude.

921
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:54,932
It's nothing. I'm sorry
you had such a fright.

922
01:18:57,958 --> 01:18:59,157
Goodbye.

923
01:18:59,277 --> 01:19:00,777
Thanks again.

924
01:19:22,797 --> 01:19:24,877
Why don't you say anything?

925
01:19:26,716 --> 01:19:28,796
What's there to say?

926
01:19:29,677 --> 01:19:30,777
That's true.

927
01:19:45,956 --> 01:19:47,835
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

928
01:19:48,476 --> 01:19:49,576
Come on!

929
01:19:50,275 --> 01:19:51,375
What could be wrong?

930
01:19:55,036 --> 01:19:59,036
Why didn't you say you were
staying with this François guy?

931
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:04,195
Didn't you think we'd be
worried if you just vanished?

932
01:20:12,235 --> 01:20:14,434
What's the problem, do you think?

933
01:20:16,955 --> 01:20:18,055
I don't know.

934
01:20:18,475 --> 01:20:20,555
Stop being so pig-headed.

935
01:20:21,115 --> 01:20:22,234
What's the matter?

936
01:20:24,434 --> 01:20:25,534
What, darling?

937
01:20:31,874 --> 01:20:35,874
If you don't know, I don't
see what we can do about it.

938
01:20:40,114 --> 01:20:41,214
There is no problem.

939
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:43,877
Why should there be one?
You know better than me.

940
01:20:44,634 --> 01:20:46,034
Leave me alone!

941
01:20:47,594 --> 01:20:50,119
What do you mean, I know better?

942
01:20:50,154 --> 01:20:54,154
Ask Pierre. He always knows everything!

943
01:20:55,954 --> 01:20:57,673
What are you trying to say?

944
01:20:58,873 --> 01:20:59,952
Nothing.

945
01:20:59,953 --> 01:21:01,953
Why did you say it then?

946
01:21:02,833 --> 01:21:04,553
Are you jealous?

947
01:21:06,993 --> 01:21:09,252
What have you got into your head?

948
01:21:09,253 --> 01:21:11,683
That Pierre and I... That's absurd!

949
01:21:11,718 --> 01:21:14,113
Because we call each other a lot?

950
01:21:14,433 --> 01:21:17,633
He's a friend. A friend
of mine and your Dad's.

951
01:21:18,033 --> 01:21:19,432
What makes you think...

952
01:21:19,513 --> 01:21:20,892
Stay here, I'm talking to you!

953
01:21:21,272 --> 01:21:24,952
Stop being so sullen. You've
no reason to act this way!

954
01:21:24,987 --> 01:21:26,472
Look at me, please!

955
01:21:29,273 --> 01:21:30,392
I swear you've got it wrong.

956
01:21:31,632 --> 01:21:33,324
I wonder how you could even think that.

957
01:21:35,752 --> 01:21:36,872
I love you.

958
01:21:47,192 --> 01:21:49,191
Really... I love you.

959
01:21:49,552 --> 01:21:53,552
Dad and I were sick with worry
when you didn't come home.

960
01:21:53,786 --> 01:21:55,357
You find that so...

961
01:21:55,717 --> 01:21:56,817
So absurd?

962
01:21:57,071 --> 01:22:01,071
Maybe we weren't sick, but we
freaked. Because we love you.

963
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:02,891
I love you.

964
01:22:26,397 --> 01:22:29,750
<i>Tomorrow, I'm interviewing
the author of The Smart Gang.</i>

965
01:22:29,785 --> 01:22:33,785
You loved that book if
memory serves me right,

966
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:38,230
If you give me your copy,
I'll ask him to sign it, okay?

967
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:42,170
Would you like that?

968
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:49,230
Are you okay?

969
01:22:50,789 --> 01:22:52,854
I'm glad you're home.

970
01:22:53,054 --> 01:22:55,463
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Dad.

971
01:22:56,917 --> 01:22:59,189
Using Berrychon as a pseudonym.

972
01:22:59,797 --> 01:23:03,248
Isabelle kept total
control over Rimbaud's work.

973
01:23:03,249 --> 01:23:04,961
- It was a huge
money-maker. - That's right.

974
01:23:04,962 --> 01:23:07,916
She began to create this aura

975
01:23:07,917 --> 01:23:09,996
of a pious nun.

976
01:23:09,997 --> 01:23:12,936
Like a builder constructs a wall garden.

977
01:23:12,937 --> 01:23:16,381
Then, she began to meddle
with Rimbaud's work.

978
01:23:17,357 --> 01:23:21,156
We know that the poems that
shocked her went on the fire.

979
01:23:21,157 --> 01:23:24,716
I can agree with the
portrait you draw of Isabelle.

980
01:23:24,717 --> 01:23:27,397
It's the same as I had
before I began the book.

981
01:23:27,697 --> 01:23:29,547
We agree, both of us, on that point.

982
01:23:29,548 --> 01:23:33,268
At the same time, I'd
like to raise a few...

983
01:23:33,748 --> 01:23:36,108
Stop, this is getting too theoretical.

984
01:23:36,143 --> 01:23:38,233
Cut at "we agree on that point."

985
01:23:38,268 --> 01:23:41,768
And go to when Teulé
talks about homosexuality.

986
01:23:43,367 --> 01:23:45,588
It's around... around 0:30.

987
01:23:49,821 --> 01:23:52,235
- It wouldn't matter.
- It's poetic license.

988
01:23:52,757 --> 01:23:54,496
But I think Rimbaud is...

989
01:23:54,497 --> 01:23:55,997
On "I think" let's try

990
01:23:56,877 --> 01:23:58,077
slotting it in...

991
01:24:03,827 --> 01:24:05,106
What do you want know?

992
01:24:22,986 --> 01:24:24,386
What's going on?

993
01:24:24,906 --> 01:24:27,426
Thanks for coming.

994
01:24:27,986 --> 01:24:29,086
Come in.

995
01:24:39,865 --> 01:24:41,586
What's this all about?

996
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:44,645
Sit down.

997
01:24:44,745 --> 01:24:46,270
No, I won't. What do you want?

998
01:24:46,305 --> 01:24:48,865
I truly had no idea about the tapes.

999
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:50,065
Is that all?

1000
01:24:51,665 --> 01:24:54,388
I called you because I
wanted you to be present...

1001
01:28:03,138 --> 01:28:05,578
It's me Please, try to get rid of them.

1002
01:28:06,315 --> 01:28:09,258
I'm in the bedroom.
Something terrible's happened.

1003
01:28:10,258 --> 01:28:11,624
I can't face them right now.

1004
01:28:12,507 --> 01:28:13,959
Hurry, please.

1005
01:29:04,657 --> 01:29:05,861
What's going on?

1006
01:29:05,896 --> 01:29:08,061
Majid committed suicide.

1007
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:09,896
I was there. He slit his throat.

1008
01:29:09,931 --> 01:29:11,031
What?

1009
01:29:11,496 --> 01:29:12,696
Yes, exactly.

1010
01:29:14,376 --> 01:29:16,456
Sadly, it's no joke.

1011
01:29:18,416 --> 01:29:19,956
What do you mean you were there?

1012
01:29:19,991 --> 01:29:21,496
I'm saying I was at his place.

1013
01:29:22,495 --> 01:29:26,342
He phoned me to come, so he
could explain about the tapes.

1014
01:29:27,455 --> 01:29:29,056
- So I went.
- And?

1015
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:31,715
And nothing.

1016
01:29:32,575 --> 01:29:35,723
He said, "I wanted you to be
present" and cut his throat.

1017
01:29:41,255 --> 01:29:42,376
That can't be...

1018
01:29:44,815 --> 01:29:47,495
Try to get rid of them. We need to talk.

1019
01:29:48,135 --> 01:29:50,214
What will I tell them?

1020
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:51,475
I don't know.

1021
01:29:52,575 --> 01:29:54,579
What did you say when I called?

1022
01:29:54,614 --> 01:29:57,415
That it was the anonymous
caller asking for you.

1023
01:29:58,255 --> 01:30:01,975
- And?
- Nothing. I excused myself and left.

1024
01:30:02,095 --> 01:30:05,014
I don't know. Tell them
you don't feel well,

1025
01:30:05,494 --> 01:30:07,894
or that Pierrot's sick.

1026
01:30:12,014 --> 01:30:13,134
Please!

1027
01:31:01,292 --> 01:31:03,413
- They're done.
- I saw.

1028
01:31:06,572 --> 01:31:07,672
Not the light.

1029
01:31:11,852 --> 01:31:13,731
What did you tell them?

1030
01:31:14,092 --> 01:31:16,697
That I'd lied to them.

1031
01:31:16,732 --> 01:31:18,817
That it was you on the phone.

1032
01:31:18,852 --> 01:31:21,732
That I had to meet you
because you were in trouble.

1033
01:31:22,012 --> 01:31:23,697
They didn't offer to come with you?

1034
01:31:23,732 --> 01:31:27,732
What, you want a transcript
of the conversation.

1035
01:31:29,452 --> 01:31:30,651
Sorry.

1036
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,650
What happened?

1037
01:31:54,610 --> 01:31:56,130
It's like I told you.

1038
01:31:57,731 --> 01:32:00,009
I went there. He asked
me in and killed himself.

1039
01:32:02,811 --> 01:32:04,321
There was a lot of blood.

1040
01:32:06,490 --> 01:32:08,210
Then, I ran off.

1041
01:32:09,650 --> 01:32:11,220
You went for help?

1042
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:14,350
What?

1043
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:17,870
No, he died immediately.

1044
01:32:22,209 --> 01:32:23,890
What are you going to do?

1045
01:32:29,209 --> 01:32:30,650
Was anybody else around?

1046
01:32:30,685 --> 01:32:31,781
No, why?

1047
01:32:31,782 --> 01:32:32,882
Come on!

1048
01:32:35,369 --> 01:32:36,769
What time did it happen?

1049
01:32:39,169 --> 01:32:40,569
This afternoon around 4, I guess.

1050
01:32:42,049 --> 01:32:44,128
So you went to the police or what?

1051
01:32:45,009 --> 01:32:46,109
No.

1052
01:32:47,089 --> 01:32:50,089
What have you been
doing? Where were you?

1053
01:32:52,049 --> 01:32:53,149
Nowhere.

1054
01:32:54,888 --> 01:32:55,988
In town.

1055
01:33:11,168 --> 01:33:12,888
You have to tell the police.

1056
01:33:14,688 --> 01:33:18,688
If anyone saw you,
you could be a suspect.

1057
01:33:20,408 --> 01:33:22,720
Then he'd have achieved his goal.

1058
01:33:22,837 --> 01:33:23,937
What?

1059
01:33:24,047 --> 01:33:26,278
What, do you have another explanation?

1060
01:33:27,807 --> 01:33:28,907
What for?

1061
01:33:29,088 --> 01:33:31,080
Why else did he ask me there?

1062
01:33:40,607 --> 01:33:41,863
What did you do to him?

1063
01:33:43,646 --> 01:33:44,746
What?

1064
01:33:46,607 --> 01:33:48,596
- When?
- Back then?

1065
01:33:50,926 --> 01:33:52,927
Who'd think up something like that?

1066
01:33:53,126 --> 01:33:55,993
First, he sends all those damn tapes.

1067
01:33:57,286 --> 01:33:58,810
You remember the drawings?

1068
01:33:59,246 --> 01:34:02,526
They must have been some
kind of forewarning, huh?

1069
01:34:02,686 --> 01:34:03,786
Georges!

1070
01:34:19,926 --> 01:34:22,397
I told Mom he was coughing up blood.

1071
01:34:24,165 --> 01:34:26,286
They didn't believe me, you see?

1072
01:34:27,805 --> 01:34:31,137
The doctor examined him,
didn't find anything.

1073
01:34:33,045 --> 01:34:35,125
He was an old fool.

1074
01:34:35,605 --> 01:34:37,725
Our family doctor, see?

1075
01:34:40,485 --> 01:34:44,124
Then I told him Dad wanted
him to kill the rooster.

1076
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:48,065
It was a... nasty bird.

1077
01:34:49,364 --> 01:34:52,080
Evil, always attacking us.

1078
01:34:55,085 --> 01:34:56,605
And he did it.

1079
01:34:58,245 --> 01:34:59,964
He cut its head off.

1080
01:35:01,524 --> 01:35:03,118
The rooster flapped around.

1081
01:35:05,444 --> 01:35:07,604
Majid was covered in blood.

1082
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:14,309
And I told them he did it to scare me.

1083
01:35:20,763 --> 01:35:23,808
To slit his own throat for that...

1084
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:26,123
A hell of a twisted
joke, don't you think?

1085
01:35:47,082 --> 01:35:48,882
Why were they here?

1086
01:35:50,002 --> 01:35:51,102
Who?

1087
01:35:51,522 --> 01:35:53,322
Pierre and Mathilde.

1088
01:35:54,642 --> 01:35:56,123
It was planned.

1089
01:35:56,442 --> 01:35:58,092
We were going to watch your show.

1090
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:03,122
I'd forgotten.

1091
01:36:08,402 --> 01:36:10,307
I thought they were in Corsica.

1092
01:36:10,922 --> 01:36:12,122
Just one week.

1093
01:36:13,721 --> 01:36:14,821
They got back yesterday.

1094
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:34,006
Hi, how are you?

1095
01:36:34,041 --> 01:36:35,605
Fine, thanks. And you?

1096
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:37,480
I didn't forget your
book. I called last week.

1097
01:36:37,515 --> 01:36:39,321
- But it hasn't arrived.
- There's no rush.

1098
01:36:39,356 --> 01:36:41,641
Maybe it's in today's mail.

1099
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:46,680
- You spoke to Malembert?
- Yes, he'll bring you the file.

1100
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:51,160
May I have a word, please?

1101
01:36:51,195 --> 01:36:52,405
What do you want?

1102
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:54,520
I would like to talk with you.

1103
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:57,200
I don't have time. Goodbye.

1104
01:38:04,718 --> 01:38:06,197
What do you want with me?

1105
01:38:07,277 --> 01:38:08,666
Why are you so scared, sir?

1106
01:38:08,998 --> 01:38:11,018
What do you want? Why are you here?

1107
01:38:11,053 --> 01:38:13,038
Would you have let me into your house.

1108
01:38:16,117 --> 01:38:17,637
I have no time. I've told you.

1109
01:38:17,672 --> 01:38:19,037
I don't believe you, sir.

1110
01:38:20,357 --> 01:38:23,877
If you refuse to find the
time, I'll make a real scene

1111
01:38:24,117 --> 01:38:26,117
and tell people things
they shouldn't hear.

1112
01:38:26,997 --> 01:38:28,842
I can't believe you'd want that.

1113
01:38:28,877 --> 01:38:31,317
Is that a threat? I
have nothing to hide.

1114
01:38:31,352 --> 01:38:32,452
Really?

1115
01:38:41,476 --> 01:38:44,277
Young man, your
father's death must hurt.

1116
01:38:44,312 --> 01:38:46,477
But I refuse to be implicated by you.

1117
01:38:50,196 --> 01:38:51,296
Be right there.

1118
01:38:52,956 --> 01:38:55,276
The police corroborated my statement.

1119
01:38:55,311 --> 01:38:56,841
It was a suicide.

1120
01:38:56,876 --> 01:38:58,826
So, please, get out of my face.

1121
01:39:01,956 --> 01:39:05,956
I'd also advise you to stop
terrorizing us with stupid tapes.

1122
01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:08,836
I had nothing to do with the tapes.

1123
01:39:12,236 --> 01:39:15,456
Just before he died your
father insisted it wasn't him.

1124
01:39:15,556 --> 01:39:18,275
Believe what you want. I'm not lying.

1125
01:39:38,914 --> 01:39:41,214
I'd like to talk to you, please.

1126
01:39:41,674 --> 01:39:44,274
I don't want to argue with
you in front of everyone.

1127
01:39:44,309 --> 01:39:46,839
Say your piece and leave
or I'll call the police.

1128
01:39:46,874 --> 01:39:50,834
I'll have you ejected. You
know you're not allowed here.

1129
01:39:51,114 --> 01:39:52,319
I'm listening.

1130
01:39:52,354 --> 01:39:54,754
Why so angry? What did I do to you?

1131
01:39:54,789 --> 01:39:56,154
What did you do to me?

1132
01:39:56,514 --> 01:39:59,794
For weeks, you terrorize my
family and me with your damn tapes!

1133
01:39:59,829 --> 01:40:02,091
I won't believe you're not involved!

1134
01:40:02,126 --> 01:40:04,354
Your father wasn't capable of that.

1135
01:40:04,389 --> 01:40:06,079
Why would I do that, sir?

1136
01:40:06,114 --> 01:40:09,633
Drop the dumbass politeness, okay?

1137
01:40:11,953 --> 01:40:15,073
You deprived my father
of a good education.

1138
01:40:15,108 --> 01:40:18,193
The orphanage teaches
hatred not politeness.

1139
01:40:18,228 --> 01:40:20,878
Yet my father raised me well.

1140
01:40:20,913 --> 01:40:22,743
I won't forget that because of you.

1141
01:40:23,993 --> 01:40:25,598
We're not finished.

1142
01:40:25,633 --> 01:40:28,033
What do you want? A fight?

1143
01:40:28,068 --> 01:40:29,518
If you insist.

1144
01:40:29,553 --> 01:40:32,353
You're probably stronger
than me. Go ahead, hit me!

1145
01:40:35,473 --> 01:40:36,753
Know what? You're sick.

1146
01:40:37,553 --> 01:40:39,152
You're as sick as your father.

1147
01:40:39,712 --> 01:40:42,552
I don't know what dump
obsessions he fed you

1148
01:40:42,587 --> 01:40:44,552
but I can tell you this...

1149
01:40:45,072 --> 01:40:47,957
You'll never give me a bad conscience

1150
01:40:47,992 --> 01:40:50,822
because your father's
life was sad or a failure.

1151
01:40:51,192 --> 01:40:52,992
I'm not to blame!

1152
01:40:53,231 --> 01:40:54,331
Do you get that?

1153
01:40:55,472 --> 01:40:59,472
If you ever try to hurt me or my
family, you'll regret it. I guarantee it.

1154
01:41:00,467 --> 01:41:02,792
I'm sick of your crap!

1155
01:41:02,827 --> 01:41:03,670
Ah, yes.

1156
01:41:03,671 --> 01:41:06,671
Threats... You're very good at those.

1157
01:41:08,511 --> 01:41:10,961
Do you expect me to apologize?

1158
01:41:11,312 --> 01:41:12,412
To whom?

1159
01:41:12,831 --> 01:41:13,931
Me?

1160
01:41:16,031 --> 01:41:17,630
So what more do you want?

1161
01:41:18,271 --> 01:41:19,571
Nothing anymore.

1162
01:41:20,311 --> 01:41:23,111
I wondered how it feels, a
man's life on your conscience.

1163
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:25,011
That's all.

1164
01:41:25,711 --> 01:41:26,830
Now I know.

1165
01:41:27,071 --> 01:41:29,051
Great, everything's okay then.

1166
01:41:29,151 --> 01:41:32,151
Do you mind if I go now?

1167
01:41:32,951 --> 01:41:34,351
Be my guest.

1168
01:44:00,146 --> 01:44:01,946
Hi, how is it going?

1169
01:44:05,305 --> 01:44:08,305
I'm just calling to let you know
I'm going to have a lie down.

1170
01:44:09,905 --> 01:44:12,605
No, I came home early.

1171
01:44:13,265 --> 01:44:16,265
I'm exhausted. I must have
picked up some kind of bug.

1172
01:44:17,545 --> 01:44:19,225
No, please, not that.

1173
01:44:20,265 --> 01:44:24,265
Anyway, I wasn't needed in the office.

1174
01:44:24,865 --> 01:44:27,065
Everything's great.
I just feel wiped out.

1175
01:44:28,464 --> 01:44:31,664
Don't wake me up when you
get home. I took 2 pills.

1176
01:44:33,264 --> 01:44:34,764
When's Pierrot home?

1177
01:44:36,384 --> 01:44:38,284
You'll be back by then.

1178
01:44:39,104 --> 01:44:42,304
Tell him to go easy on his poor old Dad.

1179
01:44:47,593 --> 01:44:48,793
I love you. Bye.

1180
01:47:17,467 --> 01:47:19,467
Come back here!

1181
01:47:33,597 --> 01:47:35,197
Let go of me!

1182
01:47:40,537 --> 01:47:42,537
I don't wanna go!

1183
01:47:42,897 --> 01:47:43,997
Calm down!
