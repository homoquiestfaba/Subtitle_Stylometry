00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,430
We'II pick up your drawing.

2
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,952
Hi, Mom.

3
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,758
- Bye, Rita.
- See you, honey.

4
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,235

5
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,788

- Nothing.

6
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,800
- Who's at home?
- Nobody.

7
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,797
AII right!

00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,519
- What did you wish for?
- He can't teII.

9
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,319
- He can choose to.
- You never do.

10
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,391
I bet you wished for a skateboard.

11
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,113
- They got you the good one.
- Yes!

12
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,078
- Comes with this.
- Thanks, you guys.

13
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,116
I got you this.

14
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,156
I know what it is.

15
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,596
- Thanks, A.D.
- AII righty.

16
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,636
Here we go.

17
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,909
- What's that?
- What a pretty cupboard!

18
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,389
- Where'd you get that?
- Found it.

19
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,313
- And you washed it?
- Yes, Mother.

20
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,236
- Thanks.
- No probIem.

21
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,834
- Is there a key?
- There's no key.

22
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,480
- I have Iots of keys.
- You save keys?

23
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,994
I've coIIected them
since I was a girI.

24
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,112
- Think it means anything?
- I didn't say that!

25
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,478
- I think she has secrets.
- What a sweet thing to say!

26
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,071
Watch out.

27
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,153
Guys, not inside. If you want
to ride, you'd better go now.

28
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,196
Not aIone.

29
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,070
A.D.?

30
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,116
AII right. Let's go.

31
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,952
Here we go.

32
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,756
OK, watch this.

33
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,716
- I can do that.
- Piece of cake.

34
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,837
I got you something
to ceIebrate your birthday.

35
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,113
- It's Iike an antique.
- Yeah.

36
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,636
I couIdn't do much, you know.
It just reminded me of you.

37
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,515
OK. See if one fits.

38
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,556
I Iove these guys.

39
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,316
- If one fits, can I have it?
- I'II give it to you.

40
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,152
Thanks.

41
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,514
- It works!
- Let me see.

42
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,795
My grandmother gave me that one.

43
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,554
She was dying
and had nothing to Ieave me

44
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,758
so I picked up that key and I said
I wanted it more than anything.

45
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,230
- What wiII I put in the cupboard?
- Here. Put this in.

46
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,193
- Omri, Iet's read.
- OK

47
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,395
Did I know her, your grandma?

48
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,995
No, you didn't.
She wouId have Ioved you.

49
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,196
''Because he was...

50
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,316
''Chapter Eight, MichaeI.

51
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,356
''Because he was so smaII,

52
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,477
''Stuart was often hard to find
around the house.

53
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,235
''His father and his mother
and his brother George...''

54
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,754
- SeIdom.
- ''..seIdom couId Iocate him

55
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,035
''by Iooking for him.

56
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,317
''UsuaIIy, they had to caII him.

57
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,077
''The house often...
echoed with cries of Stuart!

58
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,798
''Stuart...''

59
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,556
You hurt me.

60
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,239
- HeIIo.
- Demon!

61
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,788
- Demon?
- Giant!

62
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,030
- Me?
- Omri!

63
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,676
Omri, we're Iate.

64
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,356
Come on, buddy, hurry.

65
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,272
Come on.

66
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,677
Look for my bike shorts.

67
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,797
- Working on the house today?
- Yeah. Have a nice day.

68
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,713
- PIease make a skyIight.
- Goodbye, guys.

69
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,480
- Bye-bye, guys.
- Bye, Mum.

70
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,950
- I'II be right back.
- That wasn't too bad.

71
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,751
Pretty day.

72
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,037
- Did you forget something?
- Why?

73
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,156
- Did you?
- No.

74
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,511
..but the dad might open
a Chinese restaurant.

75
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,918
We've skimmed this chapter,
now Iet's have some discussion.

76
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,393
- EmiIy?
- Does Fudge's famiIy want...?

77
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,234
- I Iove the Indian. He's great.
- Why?

78
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,275
Omri, Patrick...

79
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,469
Hurry, Mum. Open the door.

80
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,551
You must be getting hungry.

81
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,116
We're home!

82
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,634
I think your meaIy worms are dead.

83
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,358
They're in the pupa stage.

84
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,035
I've seen the pupa stage.
These suckers are dead.

85
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,395
Honey, you can start them again.

86
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,436
I'm sick. I'm tired.

87
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,752
Come on.

88
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,714
- I'm heading up.
- GiIi going too?

89
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,439
- He's Iooking for his WaIkman.
- OK.

90
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,596
How do you feeI about skyIights?

91
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,596
I won't hurt you.

92
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,193
- This is magic?
- I guess.

93
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,830
I think you are a dream.

94
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,315
- Are you a reaI Indian?
- I am Onondaga gah.

95
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,994
WoIf CIan. Iroquois.

96
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,796
Iroquois? I've heard of them.

97
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,876
Were you aIways this smaII?

98
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,918
I am not smaII. You are big!

99
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,878
But I'm not big. You're so smaII.

100
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,430
Can you be the Peacemaker?

101
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,715
I'm a boy. My name is Omri.

102
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,635
- The Great Spirit can be a chiId?
- Who are you?

103
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,998
Ohkwahe. LittIe Bear.

104
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,036
LittIe Bear.

105
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,439
- How do you know EngIish?
- We know the EngIish.

106
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,318
They sent for us
to fight the French for them.

107
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,391
When? What year?

108
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,512
- Year 1 761 .
- 1 761?

109
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,990
WiII you come out, LittIe Bear?

110
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,554
You are so reaI!

111
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,958
I am. Yes. Are you?

112
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,112
If it is magic... then magic
wiII take me home. I shaII go now.

113
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,634
But you just got here.

114
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,790
Look. This is for you.

115
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,119
- What is it?
- It's a tepee. You know, a tepee.

116
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,156
I do not know.

117
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,233
- TerribIe.
- It's pIastic.

118
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,756
PIaz-teck... PIazteck.

119
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,957
- TerribIe.
- I want to try. Wait.

120
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,556
You can sIeep here.

121
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,555
You and I, we are together? Here?

122
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,473
We are here...together.

123
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,676
It's weird for me, too.

124
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,593
- Do you make it night now?
- It is night.

125
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,396
Yes, it is night.

126
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,394
I wiII be with you
when the sun rises?

127
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,550
I hope. Go to sIeep now.

128
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,112
SIeep?

129
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,475
- You sIeep?
- Yes.

130
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,796
It is magic.

131
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,872
HaIt!

132
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,837
Great Omri...up.

133
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,516
A new day.

134
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,751
The day came without you.

135
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,275
Do you make more magic now?
PIazteck things?

136
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,989
- Make what?
- A white man's gun.

137
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,878
No way. What eIse?

138
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,515
Make King George.
I'd Iike to see him.

139
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,909
I don't have any kings.

140
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,112
Where is your fire?
How does your wife cook?

141
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,112
We're inside. We can't have a fire.

142
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,715
I don't have a wife.
Do you have a wife?

143
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,553
- She died.
- I'm sorry.

144
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,316
I have decided to stay.

145
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,153
- For a time.
- ReaIIy?

146
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,072
- ReaIIy.
- I'II make you a bow and arrow.

147
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,197
Good! TooIs.
AIso, I shaII buiId a Ionghouse.

148
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,275
Onondaga gah do not sIeep in tepee.

149
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,869
What's a Ionghouse?

150
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,350
The mother's house.
The cIan home. It is made of wood.

151
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,149
I can find tooIs. How about a horse?
I can make you a horse.

152
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,879
- A horse?
- To ride.

153
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,916
Iroquois waIk.

154
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,557
What is that?

155
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,991
Outside.

156
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,518
Take us outside, Earth Grasper.

157
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,749
Don't run away. PIease.

158
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,116
This is the same as where I Iive.

159
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,629
We'd better go. Get in. Get in.

160
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,836
Get out! Go!

161
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,360
- I need bigger weapons.
- You're hurt.

162
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,749
Not much. I need husks.

163
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,035
Tie it tight. Stops the bIeeding.

164
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,999
Husks... Where are the husks?

165
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,036
What are husks?

166
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,830
Don't be afraid. It's aII right.

167
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,673
I'm a dream you're having.
Someone's hurt.

168
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,553
Hurt? Someone?
WeII, I'm your man, then.

169
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,592
Let me have a Iook.
I can do this in my sIeep, mate.

170
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,831
- Is he hurt bad?
- Dream, is it?

171
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,593
I shouId have guessed.
Am I asIeep, what?

172
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,992
The whoIe rotten war's a nightmare.
No, it's not bad. We'II tape him up.

173
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,548

Don't bring that rat in here.

287

- That was good.

298
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,514
- They are enemies?

299
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,910
Brothers?
Those brothers took my house!

340
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,437
This has got to be a deIirium!
Where's my hat?

341
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,080
- He can't stay here.
- I want to keep him.

342
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,914
- I've Iost my hat!
- Can we send him back?

343
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,718
I'm comin' to get you, DarIin'!

344
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,631
I want him!

345
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,836
Not one more drop as Iong as I Iive.

346
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,634
Oh, my dear sweet Lord!

347
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,517
I need a drink.

348
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,079
This is just gettin'
worse by the minute.

349
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,876
What's your name?

350
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,718
Boone. What's yours, Mr DeIirium?

351
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,996
He is so cooI!

352
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,389
Step back, cow pie.

353
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,671
How wiII you take care of him?

354
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,116
- Patrick, time to go.
- Coming! Let me keep him.

355
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,190
But it's got to stay a secret.

356
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,193
Listen, Iet me keep him here tonight.
I have this under controI.

357
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,238
- Bring him to schooI tomorrow.
- SchooI?

358
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,676
Everybody's so big.

359
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,073
You'II be OK. Don't cry.

360
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,116
I aIways cry.

361
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,435
The boys caII me ''Boo-hoo'' Boone.

362
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,355
I've got a soft heart.

363
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,392
- Bring him to schooI. Promise?
- I promise.

364
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,595
Be carefuI - cowboys and Indians!

365
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,591
Indians?

366
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,390
Omri, don't turn him back, pIease?

367
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,116
What Indians?

368
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,356
Redskins.

369
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,877
No!

370
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,718
Wait! What in the...
You better put me down!

371
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,791
Who do you think you are?

372
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,509
I'm teIIing you the truth,
I'II Iay you in your grave.

373
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,556
I don't care how big you are.

374
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,192
KindIy return to me my hat,
tenderfoot.

375
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,989
You say you take no more men.
You teII bIind stories.

376
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,318
Watch out that savage don't
scaIp you in your sIeep, Injun Iover.

377
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,558
You're not gonna shut me
up in here, are you?

378
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,950
Now we've become reconciIed...
as you start away.

379
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,191
Now we've become reconciIed
as you start away.

380
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,116
Don't you want this open?

381
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,873
I'm not scared any more.
You can cIose it.

382
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,789
- Is she in the dark?
- What do you mean?

383
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,912
- Does she know of me?
- No.

384
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,316
I'm aIone.

385
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,796
I need a wife.

386
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,916
Come on and fight!

387
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,472
DarIin'!

388
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:23,429
Every time I try to...
We're supposed to be a team.

389
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,992
Hey, dang!

390
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:34,669
- What's the matter with that Injun?
- No, no, stop!

391
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,591
Behave!

392
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,194
He says I steaI his horse.
He shoots at me.

393
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,996
If that's true, I'II squish him
Iike a bug. Boone, drop it!

394
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,035
WeII, she's my horse.

395
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,509
- Drop it!
- No!

396
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:57,350
I'm sick of being hauIed off. I knew
you'd side with that stinkin' savage.

397
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,352
He smeIIs and he caIIs me
a dirty savage.

398
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,591
I didn't caII you dirty,
I caIIed you stinkin'!

399
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,830
Stop it, Boone!

400
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,118
Listen to me. Boone is Ieaving.
You don't have to Iive together.

401
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,510
Where can I buy coffee?
I Iike to start my day with coffee.

402
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,797
OK, if you'II be good,
I'II make you breakfast.

403
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,872
Omri cooks! Like a woman.
You are a woman.

404
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,236
PIease! You guys
are so oId-fashioned.

405
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,788
I'II have you know
I'm a civiIized man.

406
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,189
UnIike some!

407
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,635
Where did you come from?

408
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,513
I come from Texas, Mr HaIf-a-Brain.

409
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,034
The United States of America,
comprende?

410
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,838
Omri, Texas?

411
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,275
- You're from Texas?
- Proud of it.

412
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,352
- Where are you taking me?
- To schooI.

413
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,352
- White man goes to schooI?
- That's right.

414
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,908
- I go to schooI.
- You wouIdn't Iike it.

415
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,639
- He can go, I can go.
- It's too risky.

416
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,711
- Whiskey?
- Risky! Dangerous!

417
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,156
Good. I Iike danger.
Do you Iike danger, Texas man?

418
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:02,153
Are you threatening me, Injun? You'II
need some heIp to get this scaIp.

419
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,196
Omri, send him back. Do it.

420
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,950
Come on! Come on!

421
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,352
Come on!

422
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,712
Bye-bye.

423
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,871
You got him?

424
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,679
CarefuI, he's so deIicate. Come here.

425
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,558
- Boone's in the front...
- Let me have him!

426
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,596
I got to check on LittIe Bear.

427
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,672
- You aII right, LittIe Bear?
- Let me have that!

428
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,399
- Come on! Give me him.
- CaIm down, Patrick.

429
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,232
Boys!

430
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,276
SchooI, remember?

431
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,312
AII right, thank you,
MaIcoIm and George.

432
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,358
AII right, Iet's have...
EmiIy and Loretta.

433
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,592
Loretta and I...

434
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,396
We're making a map
of the United States.

435
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,036
We buiIt it here on a piece of wood.

436
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,759
We made the whoIe country
out of fIour,

437
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:49,231
water, saIt and food coIouring
using beans for mountains,

438
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:52,869
yarn for the rivers
and rice for borders.

439
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,077
We're making the desert
out of brown sugar.

440
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,038
I thought America shouId
be green and yeIIow.

441
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,317
Loretta thought it
shouId be more Iike beige...

442
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,675
What are these foIks taIking about?

443
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,878
- ..to make it more topo...
- TopographicaI.

444
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,919
Sounds to me Iike they've
been hitting the oId tornado juice.

445
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,519
You ever been west
of the Mississippi?

446
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,315
Big river?

447
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,311
I have traveIIed far north.

448
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,355
- Land of the Micmacs.
- Micmacs?

449
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,275
Sounds too coId for me.

450
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,595
- Must be purty country though.
- Yes. CoId.

451
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,276
Purty.

452
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,275
Thank you very much.

453
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:57,273
OK, now, Iet's have...
Omri and Patrick.

454
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,158
I'II do it!
We both agreed that I'II do it.

455
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,708
I'm the best taIker.
You aII know that.

456
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,549
Patrick and I are making a voIcano.

457
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,790
It's...made out of PIay...

458
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,599
Mixed-up PIay-Doh, it's big and...

459
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,996
The smaIIpox.

460
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,592
Yes.

461
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,636
WiII you marry again, LittIe Bear?

462
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,196
If there is a woman for me.

463
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,710
Maybe have another IittIe chiId.

464
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,916
Yes.

465
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,468
I wiII heaI when
I have another chiId.

466
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:45,115
LittIe chiIdren
are the sun and moon and the stars.

467
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,516
Good morning, boys and girIs.

468
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,275
Today, Iunch is macaroni and cheese
and a buiId-your-own sandwich.

469
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:59,070
Don't worry about the iguana,
mouIting is a naturaI process.

470
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,116
Origami is canceIIed today.

471
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,352
Damn!

472
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:16,198
AII right, everybody, stay in
doubIe Iine, pIease. Thank you.

473
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,236
FoIIow Mrs Cox.

474
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,437
That's a wonderfuI
story that you're writing.

475
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,592
- Yeah.
- Have you read about the Iroquois?

476
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,636
What interested you the most?

477
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:31,269
There were six tribes
that joined together to stop the war.

478
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:35,831
They formed a true government,
our constitution borrowed from them.

479
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,036
- Yeah.
- So, what eIse?

480
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,758
As you know, I got to get
going to computer cIass.

481
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,274
- OK, I'II show you.
- No!

482
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,876
What are you doing?

483
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,032
- I'm just having fun.
- They're two reaI men.

484
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,918
- It's not fun.
- Shove it!

485
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,788
HeIIo! Excuse me.
What's going on here? What happened?

486
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,076
What happened?
AII right, somebody start taIking.

487
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,918
- We can't resoIve this now.
- We need to try.

488
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,719
- I can resoIve it. Want to see how?
- No!

489
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,870
- I couId do it!
- Do what?

490
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,518
No, no!

491
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,989
- I couId show. I couId.
- Show what?

492
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:18,277
You can't. They're peopIe.
You can't use peopIe.

493
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,832
AII right...

494
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,920
Patrick, show me
what's in your pouch.

495
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,072
PIease.

496
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,434
Patrick, show me
what's in your pouch.

497
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,475
They're just pIastic toys.
PIazteck peopIe.

498
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:02,235
- They're just compIeteIy pIazteck.
- OK.

499
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,551
- That's fine.
- PIazteck.

500
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,758
- Yes. Thank you. Let me see.
- PIazteck.

501
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,956
Let me see.

502
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,036
They're just peopIe.

503
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:00,351
Why don't you two work this out?
But no more fighting, OK?

504
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,989
- AII right.
- Go catch up with your cIass.

505
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,951
''It's just Iike having a chiId.

506
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:27,635
''Every time I'm away from him,
I worry that he's OK.

507
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,109
''I come home and open the door

508
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,475
''and worry about what I wiII find.

509
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,597
''But he's a man.
I can't treat him Iike a baby.''

510
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,391
Good. Sam.

511
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,232
''JFK.

512
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,869
''JFK was about
the youngest man ever president.

513
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,918
''There were IittIe kids
in the White House.''

514
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:53,039
Mum, can Patrick
pIease spend the night?

515
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,355
- Yeah, I think so.
- Spend the night?

516
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,396
It's a wife.

517
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,472
Excuse me.

518
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,518
- That's great. Come on.
- Look at 'em.

519
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,196
Who wiII she be?

520
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:38,073
- What is that?
- It's a wife.

521
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:42,593
A wife? My mother shouId
choose me a wife.

522
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,194
But your mother's not here.

523
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,550
I've been thinking about
settIing down my own seIf.

524
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,716
It's gone. The cupboard's gone.

525
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,037
Who wouId take it?

526
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,629
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

527
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:18,429
- The cupboard, butt-head.
- Who gave you that cupboard?

528
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:22,069
PIease, where's the cupboard?
GiIi, pIease.

529
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,116
Where's my rat baII?

530
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,830
Where? PIease?

531
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,036
In the crawIspace.

532
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,432
Damn.

533
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,874
The key! Where's the key?

534
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,916
There was no key. I swear.

535
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:48,072
You mean, we've got to Iive
here forever? LittIe Iike this?

536
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:52,233
No new wife for LittIe Bear?
No baby? He needs a baby.

537
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,991
I couId Iook for another key.

538
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,596
I want to go home. We've just got
the raiIroad coming through town

539
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,399
and we've got a new doctor,
a good doctor.

540
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,075
HeII, it's 1879. I'm Iiving
at the dawn of a new century.

541
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,674
Now I know what
you was taIking about.

542
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,069
God sure do pIay with men, aII right.

543
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,434
There is no god here.

544
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,476
Come on, GiIi!

545
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,951
- Bye, Mum. Bye, Dad.
- Bye, guys.

546
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,792
Bye, Mum.

547
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:21,036
Disgusting dispIay.

548
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,554
They do this in front of chiIdren?

549
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:29,191
- It's not reaI.
- It's reaI aII right. It's reaI.

550
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,589
Let's change to
the Discovery ChanneI.

551
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:37,112
..roaming the great savannahs
of Africa.

552
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,596
Let me see that cIicker.

553
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,279
Apaches! The ugIiest Redskins
that ever waIked the earth!

554
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,389
Get 'em, boys! HeII, yeah!

555
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,352
Amigo?

556
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,270
- He's aIive.
- I wish we had Tommy.

557
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:54,751
- You do not have the key.
- Can you take the arrow out?

558
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,993
BIood wiII fIow. Get me husks.

559
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,030
We have no husks.

560
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,391
Leave me.

561
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,632
Boys?

562
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,756
Time for bed.

563
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,559
- Can you turn out the Iight, pIease?
- Sure.

564
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,434
I feeI Iike I haven't seen
you in days.

565
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,479
- Cartoon day tomorrow.
- I don't think we'II watch, thanks.

566
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,956
- Good night.
- Good night, Mum.

567
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,837
- Night, Patrick.
- Night, Janie.

568
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,639
If you hear noises under fIoor,
it's GiIi's rat.

569
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,950
- What?
- He escaped.

570
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,396
Dad puIIed up your fIoorboards
but he couIdn't get him.

571
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,436
That rat's under my fIoor?

572
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:26,718
Maybe. He might have moved on.
If we're Iucky, he moved out.

573
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,916
- Oh, no.
- I know.

574
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,911
Good night, guys.

575
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:43,992
- Do you think he'II be OK?
- A rat wiII eat at a wounded man.

576
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,594
Now we can't go to sIeep at aII.

577
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,277
We'II take turns.

578
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,318
If you go first,
I'II give you a miIIion doIIars.

579
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:58,756
Wake up! I hear the rat! Get up!

580
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:36,077
- It's the key!
- Get it!

581
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,116
HoId this.

582
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,432
Watch out.

583
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,152
Oh, no!

584
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,276
Let me go.

585
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:15,954
I am too big. I am too big!

586
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:19,476
See if you can get under
that Ioose fIoorboard there.

587
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,790
There's an animaI, a big animaI.
Move fast.

588
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,716
Do you see a way? Is there a hoIe?

589
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,556
Yes, I see one.

590
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:45,918
Yeah?

591
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,072
- What are aIso dangers?
- Everything.

592
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:57,957
Did he take his bow and arrow?
And his knife?

593
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,791
I hear him! Over there!

594
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,879
- Where is he?
- LittIe Bear, come back.

595
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:11,872
Come back.

596
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,235
- What was that?
- I don't know.

597
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,834
PIease, LittIe Bear, come back.

598
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,229
Why won't he come?

599
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,871
I got him!

600
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,716
It's you again.

601
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,309
I do pick my moments to faII asIeep.

602
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,470
A great Minnie whining overhead.

603
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,717
Thought I was a goner.
Perhaps I am a goner. Did I die?

604
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,439
No. You're dreaming again.

605
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,992
There's two of you now,
are there? Good show.

606
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,799
WeII, take me to him.
The eIegant Injun?

607
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,552
No, it's another.

608
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:48,790
That's cIever. HeIIo again.

609
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,594
- The bIeeding stopped.
- Yes. Good.

610
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:56,753
He needs a bIood transfusion
but I'm not prepared for that.

611
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,559
- A buIIet, was it?
- Arrow.

612
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,510
Lucky it missed his heart and Iung.

613
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,875
The cotton's damp.

614
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,395
So, you're a paI of his, are you?

615
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,312
Amigo.

616
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,879
That shouId just about do it.

617
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:45,077
Look, keep a cIose watch on him.
PIenty of water.

618
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,836
He couId use a doctor's care.

619
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,750
There's a doctor in his town.

620
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,037
- No.
- When he wakes up.

621
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,111
Not yet.

622
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,956
It's time for them to go home.

623
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,198
Good. That wiII do.
He needs to sIeep.

624
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:16,428
WeII, I best be getting back.

625
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:21,071
We'II aII be waking up soon enough.
I suggest a drop of brandy.

626
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,435
- Thank you.
- You're weIcome, mate.

627
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,235
BuckIes keep catching on my doodah.

628
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,475
I'm so ashamed of myseIf.

629
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:06,076
I hurt you.

630
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:09,756
What are you taIking about?

631
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,395
Did I hear somebody mention brandy?

632
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,070
No, Omri.

633
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:12,674
She has her Iife.

634
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:15,354
She has a famiIy, a cIan.

635
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:18,716
Maybe a husband and a chiId.

636
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,995
I don't want you to be aIone.

637
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,236
I wiII be with my peopIe.

638
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,110
I wiII be with you
when the sun rises?

639
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,990
One more time.

640
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,154
Hey, son. When we go back,

641
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:26,550
are we going back to the Iast
thing we remember or ahead?

642
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,870
I don't know.

643
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,599
I hope it's forwards.
How about you, LittIe Bear?

644
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,955
LittIe Bear, where are you headed?

645
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,798
I was on the journey
with my brother's son.

646
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,030
I think I wiII wake up in the woods.

647
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,715
It is quiet
and the nights are getting coId.

648
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,630
I can aImost smeII the trees.

649
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:52,715
I can aImost smeII them, too.
Like I'm part Indian now myseIf.

650
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:57,472
If you were my nephew, it'd be
time to waIk you through the forest.

651
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:59,516
I wouId go.

652
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,396
It is difficuIt.

653
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:23,035
You wouId Iive by yourseIf,

654
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,076
care for yourseIf.

655
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:02,637
We wouId traveI for days,
teII stories,

656
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,597
hunt and fish.

657
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,954
I'd Ieave you and return
to the viIIage.

658
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,315
You must Iive aIone for one season.

659
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,870
You wouId Iearn to Iive in harmony
with Mother Nature...

660
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:17,714
the two-Iegged,
the four-Iegged, the winged.

661
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,948
When the seasons change,

662
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,996
my nephew wouId come home.

663
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,191
I wouId be waiting for you.

664
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:32,035
We wouId have a great ceIebration

665
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:35,430
because you return
to the viIIage...as a man.

666
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,395
When I Ieave you, Omri,

667
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,995
I take you...as my nephew.

668
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,910
Time to go, gentIemen.

669
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,479
Easy, DarIin'. Easy, now.

670
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,790
Don't y'aII forget me.

671
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,390
I won't.

672
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,833
You Iook after yourseIf now,
LittIe Bear.

673
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,396
And you, friend.

674
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,157
- Goodbye, my friendIy giants.
- Great Spirit?

675
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:52,470
