1
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:34,480
The world is a
place of never ending sorrow.

2
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,570
We've become ghosts even before we've died.

3
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,760
Floating about as if time was infinite.

4
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,439
Concerning ourselves only with things that

5
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,680
don't matter in the end.

6
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,953
But here is what I know to be true.

7
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:11,959
Love exists when we choose it.

8
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,437
I loved you from the
moment our eyes crossed.

9
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:19,090
And when our lips first met.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,050
From the first time you hugged
me tightly, and inhaled my musk.

11
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,050
I loved you, from the
moment our eyes crossed.

12
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,169
And when our lips first met.

13
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:49,751
The first time you hugged me
tightly and inhaled my musk.

14
00:04:03,653 --> 00:04:09,526
I..

15
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:13,056
can never tell what's good
or what isn't with poetry.

16
00:04:13,057 --> 00:04:15,189
It seems to just all float over my head.

17
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:19,961
It's like with any writing.

18
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,123
If the words connect with
you emotionally, it's good.

19
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:28,809
What do you do?

20
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,290
I'm a neuroengineer.

21
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:35,150
I get a paycheck
every two weeks from my job

22
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:35,840
after college.

23
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:40,075
It's not everyday that
I met a neuroengineer.

24
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,630
I'll consider your offer.

25
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,300
How do I get to a yes?

26
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,779
How about we keep talking.

27
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,900
We'll see where it takes us.

28
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:10,837
Now from
prostheses my research from

29
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:15,279
segued into a field called
whole brain emulation.

30
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:22,319
In WBD, he have to assume
that brain activity is

31
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,690
computable therefore it can
be replicated mathematically.

32
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,719
There are three basic
requirements to emulation

33
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,429
is the capability to scan the
brain, interpret the data and

34
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,219
software to simulate the brain model.

35
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,279
I'm working on a brain scanner.

36
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,707
In fact, I have the prototype here.

37
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,336
Pull up H0351.

38
00:10:38,627 --> 00:10:40,251
You look absolutely beguiled.

39
00:10:46,377 --> 00:10:48,875
What are you working on?

40
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:50,294
Some calculations.

41
00:10:56,461 --> 00:10:57,861
What kinda calculations?

42
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,250
I'm really
trying to get this done.

43
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:52,225
Just the other day as
we were returning from dinner,

44
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:57,141
I thought that the first
declaration of love should be

45
00:12:57,142 --> 00:13:02,274
followed by a compact in which
lovers pledge to be bold,

46
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:04,586
courageous and daring.

47
00:13:10,003 --> 00:13:14,237
The work is being
fearless in the face of personal

48
00:13:14,238 --> 00:13:18,794
history and daring to
imagine a transcendent life.

49
00:13:18,795 --> 00:13:23,751
A life outside the shadows of suffering.

50
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:27,625
A life untethered.

51
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:29,586
A spirit free to rise.

52
00:17:43,352 --> 00:17:44,036
Hello?

53
00:17:44,037 --> 00:17:46,023
It's Sophie.

54
00:17:58,096 --> 00:18:04,115
Hello.

55
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:11,198
I got it.

56
00:18:15,165 --> 00:18:16,210
Coffee?

57
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:17,907
Yes, please.

58
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:27,214
I brought some lunch.

59
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:28,079
Thanks.

60
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,220
Totally.

61
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:37,164
Thank you.

62
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:56,402
You do anything today?

63
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:57,940
Mm-mm.

64
00:18:57,941 --> 00:18:59,444
Did you read the paper?

65
00:18:59,445 --> 00:19:00,445
Mm-mm.

66
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:09,420
You don't need to do that.

67
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:11,352
I like to.

68
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:24,467
You hungry?

69
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:56,282
I have to say this.

70
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:06,605
I think you need to
talk to someone, professionally.

71
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,578
I'm good.

72
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:13,500
You're not.

73
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:16,850
After three years you
should be in a better place.

74
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:03,700
Ready?

75
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:07,060
I'm donating
my brain to science.

76
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:10,807
What do I get out of it?

77
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:12,326
Digital immortality.

78
00:21:17,516 --> 00:21:18,676
That sounds awful.

79
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:30,969
How about
you'll be helping me out?

80
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,964
That, I'm down with.

81
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,703
Comfortable?

82
00:22:28,704 --> 00:22:31,764
I'm not sure if
comfortable is appropriate.

83
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:33,184
Tolerable?

84
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:38,218
Tolerable.

85
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,577
Consciousness
is in the prefrontal cortex, and

86
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:48,761
if such as thing as this so exists.

87
00:22:48,762 --> 00:22:49,608
All right.

88
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:52,682
It would be there along
with the other higher

89
00:22:52,683 --> 00:22:53,237
functions.

90
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,762
Emotions.

91
00:22:57,929 --> 00:22:59,572
Remember these?

92
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,273
So, I just
stroll down memory lane?

93
00:23:14,802 --> 00:23:16,222
Yes.

94
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:55,726
I knew you would break

95
00:23:55,727 --> 00:24:01,012
my heart from the moment

96
00:24:01,013 --> 00:24:06,034
our eyes crossed, and

97
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:11,595
when our lips first met.

98
00:24:11,596 --> 00:24:15,831
From the first time you hugged
me tightly and inhaled my musk.

99
00:24:45,632 --> 00:24:50,055
I knew he would
break my heart from the moment

100
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:54,846
our eyes crossed, and
when our lips first met.

101
00:24:54,847 --> 00:25:00,404
From the first time you hugged
me tightly, and inhaled my musk.

102
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,063
Hello?

103
00:26:02,064 --> 00:26:03,418
Ms. Lena Thierry?

104
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:04,901
This is she.

105
00:26:04,902 --> 00:26:05,935
Good evening ma'am.

106
00:26:05,936 --> 00:26:10,234
We have you down as Didier
Lole's emergency contact is that

107
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,120
correct?

108
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:13,103
Mm-hm.

109
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:16,036
I'm sorry
there's been an accident.

110
00:26:16,037 --> 00:26:21,081
Mr. Loles was mortally wounded.

111
00:26:21,082 --> 00:26:22,583
We need you to come, and

112
00:26:22,584 --> 00:26:26,275
identify his remains in the
medical examiner's office.

113
00:26:26,276 --> 00:26:28,419
I'm really sorry.

114
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,420
Ma'am, ma'am, hello?

115
00:28:15,415 --> 00:28:17,464
A cruel fate love is.

116
00:28:19,287 --> 00:28:21,398
It fills you up.

117
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:26,371
Concurrently it hollows you out, shattering

118
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:31,222
you before putting you back together again.

119
00:28:31,223 --> 00:28:35,008
Hopefully as Hemingway believed,

120
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:39,179
I'll be stronger in the broken place.

121
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:16,623
On.

122
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:20,198
Execute

123
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:21,818
program.

124
00:29:21,819 --> 00:29:28,268
Didier?

125
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:33,082
Are you there?

126
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:35,642
It's me, Lena.

127
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:43,466
Am I dead?

128
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:56,018
You look beautiful.
