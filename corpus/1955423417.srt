1
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,323
Tell the people to go home.
Quickly now.

2
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:43,492
Go home! There is nothing to see,
there's nothing to take.

3
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,538
Put him over there.

4
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,633
Taking names to your father?
My name is Luc Carlens.

5
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,930
- I know.
- Tell your father to arrest me.

6
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:02,975
Son of a collaborator!

7
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:06,934
- Any survivors?
- No.

8
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:12,791
Hello. I am Belgian. This is Belgium.

9
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:15,796
Belgium. Delahaut.

10
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:21,552
I am Jean. You have to hide.

11
00:04:21,768 --> 00:04:25,184
- I can return for you. Return.
- Return?

12
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:27,436
Yes! I'll return.

13
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,828
It's Jean.

14
00:05:11,904 --> 00:05:13,897
Please!

15
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:25,001
- It's late.
- Madame Daussois.

16
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:30,545
I need to see Monsieur Daussois.

17
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:33,627
- Why?
- An American from the plane.

18
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:37,794
He's outside. I found him
in the woods. He's dying.

19
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:43,600
- Why did you come here?
- You're in the Maquis.

20
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:49,391
No, you're mistaken. What's that?

21
00:05:54,032 --> 00:05:55,574
The wheelbarrow.

22
00:06:00,913 --> 00:06:05,707
He's dying.
Madame Daussois, I promised.

23
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,375
Go to Madame Dinant.

24
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:36,527
- Is the pilot conscious?
- No.

25
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:41,702
- You should get dressed.
- It's too early.

26
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:43,956
You came to bed late.

27
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:50,083
I couldn't sleep.
I was afraid he would die.

28
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:54,428
It happens. The others died.

29
00:06:54,637 --> 00:06:58,220
Claire, you can't save everyone.

30
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:00,674
I don't understand you.

31
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:09,444
I told you not to take any more,
but you did it anyway.

32
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,237
This is the last one.

33
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:21,415
There's a meeting at Jauquet's.
I'll be back after dinner.

34
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:36,254
If I find out that you've lied to me,
I'll beat your brains out.

35
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:44,102
I was playing with Luc Carlens.
You can ask his father.

36
00:07:44,315 --> 00:07:48,147
Goddamn Maquis!
I don't talk to such people.

37
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,112
They are destroying Belgium.

38
00:07:51,322 --> 00:07:55,451
- Don't go near them. Understand?
- Yes, sir.

39
00:07:57,703 --> 00:08:00,789
- Thank you, Mother.
- My hand hurts.

40
00:08:24,691 --> 00:08:27,894
- This is the place.
- Pardon?

41
00:08:36,286 --> 00:08:41,708
- Where am I?
- Delahaut. Belgium.

42
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:48,043
- How do I get out?
- No, not today.

43
00:08:48,257 --> 00:08:52,718
- I have to contact my squadron.
- It's done.

44
00:08:59,018 --> 00:09:01,058
It's done.

45
00:09:04,273 --> 00:09:06,101
Who are you?

46
00:09:06,318 --> 00:09:09,853
- I am Claire.
- I am Ted.

47
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:16,699
- Ted.
- And the others?

48
00:09:17,996 --> 00:09:19,741
No.

49
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:23,873
No.

50
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,841
Thank you.

51
00:09:32,054 --> 00:09:36,679
Thank you for taking care of me,
reading.

52
00:09:36,892 --> 00:09:39,348
You listen?

53
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:45,562
It's poetry. Gerard Manley Hopkins.

54
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:49,524
An English airman we had
gave it to me.

55
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:53,783
Maybe later you can read more.

56
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:59,008
Your voice... is soothing.
It makes me feel...

57
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:02,956
I hear talking. It's my turn.

58
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:09,155
Don't worry. He is with the Maquis.
He is here to help you.

59
00:10:09,468 --> 00:10:13,050
The Resistance. We will get you home.

60
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:22,975
Feeling better?

61
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:26,394
- I don't...
- He asks if you feel well.

62
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:29,945
Tell him not well, but not dead.

63
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:33,655
Not well, but not dead.
I have to get some water.

64
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:38,198
- Where are you going? Stay.
- Tell me, then, of you.

65
00:10:38,415 --> 00:10:44,335
- This was not a bomber.
- No.

66
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:48,794
The pilot told me that
reconnaissance flights have begun.

67
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:54,798
It's not a rumour. It's a fact.
A fact that crashed in our backyard.

68
00:10:55,015 --> 00:11:00,603
- It was a reconnaissance flight.
- What sort of reconnaissance?

69
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:03,351
For an invasion.

70
00:11:05,736 --> 00:11:07,978
He said that a Flimsy radio

71
00:11:08,196 --> 00:11:13,534
containing navigational codes
was still on the plane.

72
00:11:13,743 --> 00:11:18,323
Nazi specialists have left Berlin,
while German soldiers stand guard.

73
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,913
We have to get into the plane.

74
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:24,827
We'd have to kill the soldiers.
There'd be reprisals.

75
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:30,173
If the Germans get the Flimsy,
there might not be an invasion.

76
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:34,515
We'd be stuck in this prison for life.

77
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,686
- We can't take that chance.
- It was destroyed.

78
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:49,817
- Yes.
- We can't say yes.

79
00:11:50,032 --> 00:11:55,949
We've waited for this so long...
I can't remember how it was before.

80
00:11:56,664 --> 00:12:02,039
Jauquet, it's like you said.
It's like waiting for Christmas Eve.

81
00:12:02,252 --> 00:12:05,538
We can't risk everything
for a Christmas dream.

82
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:08,045
We have to be of one mind.

83
00:12:09,553 --> 00:12:12,553
Say it! Spit it out!

84
00:12:18,394 --> 00:12:21,977
Lucette... please.

85
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:27,024
Yes.

86
00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:33,070
All right, we agree. It was destroyed.

87
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,408
We leave the plane alone.

88
00:13:14,204 --> 00:13:16,742
You're so warm.

89
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,415
What time is it?

90
00:13:21,712 --> 00:13:26,042
We decided... and then we drank.

91
00:13:31,722 --> 00:13:35,850
The pilot is getting better.
You're drunk!

92
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:41,220
Only a little. And we have a plan.

93
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:43,480
Three days.

94
00:13:43,693 --> 00:13:48,698
Then he'll be gone...
as if he was already gone.

95
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:58,081
- Kiss me. Too many clothes!
- It's cold.

96
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,332
Help me.

97
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:12,428
You don't love me.

98
00:14:16,562 --> 00:14:22,351
- Go to sleep. You're really drunk.
- That's not true.

99
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:33,202
Isn't it natural for a man
to want a child with his wife?

100
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:38,952
- You'll wake the pilot.
- Fuck your American pilot!

101
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:49,008
You humiliate me. You don't love me.

102
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:57,186
I am here.

103
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:13,739
MacGreedy, Harpring,
Ellison, Dwyer, Blaise.

104
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:18,996
Davidowitz. Balzacs. Smalls. Wellman.

105
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,995
Mac. John.

106
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:27,130
- I apologise.
- No. Come on in.

107
00:15:27,345 --> 00:15:30,429
You were talking.

108
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,556
Names.

109
00:15:37,564 --> 00:15:41,478
My crew. My boys from the LIB.

110
00:15:43,987 --> 00:15:46,739
I don't want to forget their names.

111
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:57,248
Sorry.

112
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:02,583
They were good men. The best.

113
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,669
Of course.

114
00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:09,384
Except for Wellman.
He was a son of a bitch.

115
00:16:11,683 --> 00:16:13,722
Tell me.

116
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:20,398
Ted, remember me their names.

117
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:29,199
Matt MacGreedy, John Harpring...

118
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:05,440
2Hey, lazybones. I thought
you were going to sleep all day.

119
00:17:05,655 --> 00:17:09,072
You should go slow. You are not ready.

120
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:12,654
It's only three days
since your fever passed.

121
00:17:12,872 --> 00:17:14,911
Three days. Boy!

122
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:18,660
It feels like I've been here since...

123
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:28,720
I heard Henri leave
about an hour ago, I think.

124
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:32,014
You hear everything in that room.

125
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,390
He didn't leave alone.

126
00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:40,307
They meet almost every day
to prepare the route.

127
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:42,103
Good. I need to go.

128
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,924
They will move you tomorrow,
now that you can walk.

129
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:11,131
I will miss you.
I memorised the way you smell.

130
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:17,433
I can tell you're coming
before I hear your footsteps.

131
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:26,239
I should ride into town.
Tell Henri it is time.

132
00:18:30,662 --> 00:18:33,913
"Glory be to God for dappled things -

133
00:18:34,124 --> 00:18:40,070
"For skies of corporal-colour...
couple-colour as a brinded cow,

134
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:47,382
"For rose-moles all in stipple
upon trout that swim;

135
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:52,343
"Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls;
finches' wings... "

136
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:58,274
Then there's some other
very poetic lines that I forget.

137
00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:02,979
It's easier doing this
not having to look at your face.

138
00:19:03,196 --> 00:19:06,695
- That is a favourite.
- I'm sorry I mangled it.

139
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:11,617
I knew it was your favourite.
That page was all wrinkled.

140
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:13,871
You leave your mark behind.

141
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:21,589
- You should not be down here.
- I just want to thank you.

142
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:24,504
I will tell Henri.

143
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,004
- Stay out of sight.
- You saved my life, you know.

144
00:19:28,223 --> 00:19:32,352
- Yes. Well, no.
- Yes.

145
00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:34,139
The hero!

146
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:37,889
Jean, I've been wanting to thank you.

147
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:41,810
- He does not understand you.
- I think he does.

148
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,288
He is already playing football?

149
00:19:56,503 --> 00:19:58,081
I wanted to thank you.

150
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,420
Tell him he's lucky he's better.

151
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:01,960
You must hide.

152
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:05,545
- The Americans claim everything.
- He's a hero.

153
00:20:05,763 --> 00:20:07,802
I want him hidden. Now!

154
00:20:08,014 --> 00:20:12,642
<i>- Thank you. Merci. You understand?
- Yes! Thank you.</i>

155
00:20:12,853 --> 00:20:16,104
- Take him upstairs.
- Go home, kid. Now!

156
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,355
- Please...
- I said now!

157
00:20:27,786 --> 00:20:30,657
It would be good
to be rid of the American.

158
00:20:30,872 --> 00:20:34,157
I'm sick of house guests.
Another month like that...

159
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,745
- It's what we do.
- Yes.

160
00:20:37,963 --> 00:20:41,248
- A month is a long time.
- We'll manage.

161
00:20:42,926 --> 00:20:44,967
It's all we can do.

162
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,879
He likes your wife.
Maybe she likes him.

163
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,386
Stop it. I've got enough enemies as it is.

164
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:02,023
What's happening?

165
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:05,324
- You should not be downstairs.
- I need to know!

166
00:21:05,534 --> 00:21:09,116
The Nazis found one of the tunnels
out of Bruly-de-Pesche.

167
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:14,489
The tunnels are blocked. You cannot
move. Maybe soon. I don't know.

168
00:21:14,711 --> 00:21:19,538
Not soon? I need to talk
to your husband or Anthoine.

169
00:21:19,758 --> 00:21:21,797
- In the morning.
- Now.

170
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:26,637
- Now is not the time.
- I'm sick of being in the dark.

171
00:21:26,848 --> 00:21:30,977
I am sorry. We have our ways also.

172
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:35,764
I've flown 31 combat missions.
I've been a target for 14 months.

173
00:21:35,983 --> 00:21:41,922
I'm ignored by the people I'm trying
to save! You know where to find me.

174
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,324
You only think of yourself.
We could all die!

175
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:49,663
I won't sit here while you decide
what happens to me!

176
00:21:49,873 --> 00:21:53,454
We do not ignore you. We save you!

177
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:58,377
The less you know,
the safer it is for everyone.

178
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:01,675
We're doing everything we can!

179
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:07,634
And it's our way. Goodnight, Major.

180
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:52,369
Let me go!

181
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:30,184
- What are you doing here?
- The village is empty.

182
00:25:30,397 --> 00:25:34,228
They took half the village
and locked them in the barn.

183
00:25:34,443 --> 00:25:37,894
- What?
- Someone killed the German guards.

184
00:25:38,113 --> 00:25:40,983
What will they do? Where is Henri?

185
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,360
Go home. I'll catch up with you.
I'll move you as soon as possible.

186
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,280
- Move me where?
- Into the tunnel with the others.

187
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,369
I'll bring food for everyone.
Pack only what you need.

188
00:25:55,924 --> 00:26:00,750
You were gone a long time.
I was beginning to get worried.

189
00:26:02,722 --> 00:26:07,467
- What is it? You're flushed.
- I had a bad tyre.

190
00:26:07,686 --> 00:26:11,552
- Bring it in. I'll fix it.
- No.

191
00:26:11,773 --> 00:26:15,901
- You need your bike.
- No.

192
00:26:16,111 --> 00:26:20,025
- What's going on?
- Please, go back upstairs.

193
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,280
Please!

194
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,449
- Have you seen Jean?
- You're scaring me.

195
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,250
What is it?

196
00:26:43,055 --> 00:26:46,342
- Reprisals.
- For what?

197
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,845
Someone killed the Germans
at your plane.

198
00:26:50,063 --> 00:26:52,816
Now it's the Belgians' turn to die.

199
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:56,560
- Where is your husband?
- I do not know.

200
00:27:04,246 --> 00:27:06,284
Philippe Jauquet.

201
00:27:10,127 --> 00:27:12,165
Emilie Boccart.

202
00:27:14,381 --> 00:27:16,670
Emilie Boccart!

203
00:27:18,302 --> 00:27:20,839
Jean-Luc Verdun.

204
00:27:24,891 --> 00:27:28,096
Adrien van der Elst.

205
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:30,270
Elise van der Elst.

206
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:33,565
Sylvain Jacquemart.

207
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:37,905
Leon Balle. Roger Doumont.

208
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,196
Pascal Guillaume.

209
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,908
Klaas de Borgher.

210
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,376
Therese Dinant.

211
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:14,105
Long live Belgium!

212
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:31,124
- What will the others say?
- I have to stay.

213
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:34,208
He'll turn himself in to protect us.

214
00:28:34,424 --> 00:28:38,552
He doesn't understand
that we'll lose everything.

215
00:28:38,762 --> 00:28:41,631
What do I tell your husband?

216
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:50,060
There is a little boy.
This is where I belong.

217
00:28:50,273 --> 00:28:53,310
Should I really tell him that?

218
00:28:55,403 --> 00:28:59,532
- What if the American did it?
- I know him.

219
00:28:59,742 --> 00:29:02,113
Then keep an eye on him.

220
00:29:06,248 --> 00:29:08,786
I'll contact you as soon as I can.

221
00:29:10,837 --> 00:29:14,538
- Yes. Thank you.
- Now hide.

222
00:29:17,218 --> 00:29:20,753
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

223
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:27,743
Pretty girl.

224
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:32,416
Shame she's not at home.

225
00:30:38,096 --> 00:30:41,547
Perhaps we could wait
for her to come back.

226
00:30:43,601 --> 00:30:46,472
Let's go. There are other houses.

227
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:06,624
- We should have stayed with the others.
- This is important.

228
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:08,910
I needed to speak to you alone.

229
00:31:09,127 --> 00:31:13,422
We should have stayed and fought.
It's not like us to run away.

230
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:16,834
- Sit down.
- There's no water.

231
00:31:17,054 --> 00:31:19,923
Not even a chance of some cold tea.

232
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:25,975
Will you listen to me?
Bellefroid told me, but no one else.

233
00:31:26,187 --> 00:31:29,059
I think you should know.

234
00:31:29,274 --> 00:31:33,902
The Germans said they suspected
an American had survived the crash

235
00:31:34,113 --> 00:31:36,687
and killed the guards to get the codes.

236
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:41,368
He had no idea what would happen.
He didn't think.

237
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:45,957
- And Claire stayed with him.
- Yes.

238
00:31:46,168 --> 00:31:49,252
Maybe you should have stayed, too.

239
00:31:53,174 --> 00:31:55,547
Yes, she's your wife.

240
00:31:56,971 --> 00:32:01,514
- Of course.
- I'm talking rubbish. You know me.

241
00:32:07,064 --> 00:32:10,648
What about the Flimsy and the codes?
Did he get them?

242
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,530
Nobody knows.

243
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,701
I can't go back.

244
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:15,041
It's not that bad,
if you like broken stuff.

245
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:20,422
- You think everything is funny?
- No. Just the depressing things.

246
00:33:20,642 --> 00:33:22,469
Are you hungry?

247
00:33:24,855 --> 00:33:27,725
Why did you come so close?

248
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,812
A reconnaissance flight.

249
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:35,156
The Allies are gathering
intelligence for an invasion.

250
00:35:56,682 --> 00:35:58,176
Mother?

251
00:36:04,189 --> 00:36:06,228
It's Jean.

252
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,370
He's gone.

253
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:27,077
- Will he come back?
- I don't know.

254
00:36:27,297 --> 00:36:31,425
I have a list of the people
who were killed.

255
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,096
- I can't.
- They killed Emilie Boccart.

256
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,311
She was your friend.

257
00:36:46,316 --> 00:36:47,895
I'm sorry.

258
00:36:50,612 --> 00:36:55,025
You let him do it.
You let them all do it.

259
00:37:05,086 --> 00:37:08,254
I have a new family.

260
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,300
It's me, Jean.

261
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,423
Thank you. That's kind.

262
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:02,304
Goodbye.

263
00:38:02,522 --> 00:38:05,892
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

264
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,148
I need you here.

265
00:38:09,737 --> 00:38:11,778
Are you coming?

266
00:38:26,589 --> 00:38:28,628
It's healing up quickly.

267
00:38:28,842 --> 00:38:31,713
It always fades away in the end.

268
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:40,556
I made a list, to remember everyone.

269
00:38:40,771 --> 00:38:44,520
- What is this?
- They are dead.

270
00:38:55,286 --> 00:38:57,741
They were hanged.

271
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:02,370
Not a word to the American, you hear?

272
00:39:02,585 --> 00:39:08,487
- He wouldn't have let them do it!
- Jean, listen to me. Not a word.

273
00:39:09,301 --> 00:39:14,819
- All the Germans!
- Do you hear me? It's too much.

274
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:22,970
Did you ever see a person hanged,
Madame Daussois?

275
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:29,093
They look like they're dancing,
but their feet don't touch the floor.

276
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:44,120
I've told you now.
I won't tell anyone else.

277
00:39:44,337 --> 00:39:49,333
- Hey, partner.
- He brought food. He's a good boy.

278
00:39:49,551 --> 00:39:54,179
If he could speak French,
he'd be all right. I'll be right down.

279
00:39:57,976 --> 00:40:01,062
- Not a word.
- Not a word.

280
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,955
Care to dance?

281
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:24,039
Do you want to dance with him?

282
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:09,050
- Do you want kids?
- The war.

283
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:10,755
Ever?

284
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:18,392
Do me the honour. You're making me
look bad in front of the kid.

285
00:41:29,197 --> 00:41:33,113
- No dancing.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

286
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:39,579
No dancing.

287
00:42:36,978 --> 00:42:39,813
I feel like my dad.

288
00:42:40,022 --> 00:42:44,650
He used to carry me in from his truck
when I'd pretend to be asleep.

289
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:49,190
- You are so good with him.
- It's easy. He's a great kid.

290
00:42:49,407 --> 00:42:51,898
Where does he live?

291
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:54,159
Here, I think.

292
00:42:59,919 --> 00:43:04,545
- Jean considers this home.
- Did he tell you?

293
00:43:04,757 --> 00:43:10,214
No, but it's obvious. I noticed
Jean wasn't wearing my dog tags.

294
00:43:14,934 --> 00:43:19,181
But he's a smart boy.
He knows he cannot wear them.

295
00:43:19,398 --> 00:43:22,352
I am sure he hides them somewhere.

296
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:25,188
I should get them back.

297
00:43:26,322 --> 00:43:31,826
Let him sleep.
He can get them for you later.

298
00:43:32,035 --> 00:43:35,037
There goes my identity.

299
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:39,750
I'm beginning to forget who I am.

300
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:09,656
I promised myself I wouldn't
say it out loud, but there it is.

301
00:44:15,331 --> 00:44:21,316
Message from London about the plane.
The codes are safe.

302
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:23,670
They were destroyed.

303
00:44:23,882 --> 00:44:27,381
- By the pilot?
- Nobody knows.

304
00:44:27,595 --> 00:44:31,296
But whoever it was
kept the codes out of German hands,

305
00:44:31,515 --> 00:44:33,888
although it was at terrible cost.

306
00:44:34,101 --> 00:44:39,725
Our next objective is Hanzinelle,
one of the Nazis' key supply lines.

307
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,475
The time has come. I'm sorry.

308
00:44:43,695 --> 00:44:48,440
- Eleven dead.
- I need a team to blow up the bridges.

309
00:44:48,658 --> 00:44:51,695
And we must do it soon.

310
00:44:51,911 --> 00:44:55,862
- It takes two days to get to Hanzinelle.
- Claire...

311
00:44:56,082 --> 00:44:59,452
Let's pull ourselves together.

312
00:45:03,591 --> 00:45:05,630
I will go to Hanzinelle.

313
00:45:07,469 --> 00:45:10,970
I'll teach the Nazis
what reprisals mean to us.

314
00:45:11,182 --> 00:45:13,721
Filip is right.

315
00:45:14,852 --> 00:45:19,929
I need focus.
I'm going to Hanzinelle.

316
00:46:01,193 --> 00:46:05,523
I have not been given a bath
since I was a girl.

317
00:46:13,373 --> 00:46:16,243
Claire, do you love your husband?

318
00:46:18,127 --> 00:46:21,692
This war, it... changes people.

319
00:46:32,768 --> 00:46:36,053
I waited a long time for him.

320
00:46:37,689 --> 00:46:41,818
I know since very small
that I am marrying Henri.

321
00:46:42,027 --> 00:46:46,525
- Henri is my cousin.
- Cousin?

322
00:46:48,118 --> 00:46:50,158
Is that allowed?

323
00:46:51,954 --> 00:46:57,115
Not close. Far cousin.
But the same last name.

324
00:46:59,671 --> 00:47:04,084
- I don't even know your last name.
- Daussois.

325
00:47:04,302 --> 00:47:06,507
Daussois.

326
00:47:08,014 --> 00:47:11,548
You are not tired of me?

327
00:47:11,767 --> 00:47:17,308
I'm not funny, not brave,
and my hands are ugly.

328
00:47:18,649 --> 00:47:20,477
No.

329
00:47:25,991 --> 00:47:28,030
I adore this face.

330
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,893
- You used to have cows.
- I do not remember. Come inside.

331
00:49:18,109 --> 00:49:22,653
I bet you were good with them.
It must have been a nice place.

332
00:49:22,863 --> 00:49:24,904
You want that they catch you?

333
00:49:25,117 --> 00:49:29,245
Screw the Nazis. I'd like to kill
every goddamn one of them.

334
00:49:29,455 --> 00:49:33,154
- Come inside.
- Belgium will be free soon.

335
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:37,503
Next time I fly here,
it's going to be with you by my side,

336
00:49:37,713 --> 00:49:39,954
come back to see your parents.

337
00:49:41,217 --> 00:49:45,345
- My parents are dead. Come inside.
- No.

338
00:49:47,974 --> 00:49:50,013
Come here.

339
00:49:53,604 --> 00:49:56,177
I'm not afraid.

340
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,398
You should be.

341
00:50:08,203 --> 00:50:11,074
I'm going to marry you, Claire.

342
00:50:15,503 --> 00:50:18,588
I'm going to marry Claire Daussois.

343
00:50:23,385 --> 00:50:25,426
Give me some light.

344
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:28,508
- Ready over there?
- Yes, go ahead.

345
00:50:30,935 --> 00:50:32,976
Let's go.

346
00:50:35,941 --> 00:50:40,318
That's it, boys, I'm ready!
Cover your ears!

347
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:04,610
I can't close my eyes.
I see Claire at the end of a rope.

348
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:09,806
She's Okay.

349
00:51:15,066 --> 00:51:17,104
She doesn't love me.

350
00:51:20,571 --> 00:51:23,323
Try and sleep.

351
00:51:23,533 --> 00:51:27,911
Maybe there's light
at the end of these goddamn tunnels.

352
00:51:30,581 --> 00:51:33,453
Sometimes I'm afraid of her.

353
00:51:33,669 --> 00:51:38,413
Henri, let's get this done
and then maybe we can go home.

354
00:51:39,759 --> 00:51:43,458
What if we set the table
and nobody comes?

355
00:51:50,394 --> 00:51:52,434
I'm not a soldier.

356
00:51:55,817 --> 00:51:58,058
Leave me be.

357
00:52:17,506 --> 00:52:22,050
- My boy, are you Okay?
- I have a new house.

358
00:52:23,263 --> 00:52:26,299
What can I get for you?
We have apples today.

359
00:52:26,516 --> 00:52:30,430
- I have a new mother.
- That's nice.

360
00:52:30,645 --> 00:52:33,219
She's called Claire Daussois.

361
00:52:36,068 --> 00:52:38,606
Quick! Some bread, cheese and beer.

362
00:52:43,492 --> 00:52:46,197
What's the little runt saying?

363
00:52:46,411 --> 00:52:50,540
You have to wait your turn.
I was talking to Madame Oomlop!

364
00:52:56,672 --> 00:53:00,255
Where is she, then?
We don't need to wait.

365
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:03,885
Wait your turn!
It's my village. It's our store.

366
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:07,097
The bread is fresh.
Jean, get out of here.

367
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:10,428
You have to wait,
like everybody else!

368
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:14,229
- Enough.
- I want apples for my mother and me,

369
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:16,565
and for my father too.

370
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:21,362
What's he doing? I should kill him!

371
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:24,409
- Take your food and go!
- The kid's crazy.

372
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:26,658
Go!

373
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:42,761
- What got into you?
- Three apples for my mother, please.

374
00:53:42,972 --> 00:53:46,885
- This is nonsense.
- And some beer.

375
00:54:32,857 --> 00:54:36,986
- I will be back as soon as I can.
- Get some more bandages.

376
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:40,066
Jean's cut could be getting infected.

377
00:54:40,282 --> 00:54:45,240
- You are the nurse now?
- I had a very good teacher.

378
00:54:45,454 --> 00:54:48,371
Good. I'm tired of fixing men's faces.

379
00:54:48,582 --> 00:54:50,622
- She loves you.
- Jean!

380
00:54:50,834 --> 00:54:54,584
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

381
00:54:54,797 --> 00:54:58,711
- Love, love, love you.
- Love you!

382
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:10,513
<i>The cat... le chat... is away.
The mice will play.</i>

383
00:55:10,731 --> 00:55:15,688
Don't worry if you don't catch on
right away. It takes practice.

384
00:55:15,903 --> 00:55:18,524
It's a little different than soccer.

385
00:55:18,739 --> 00:55:22,239
- Baseball.
- Here we go!

386
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:25,950
A little Allie Reynolds chin music.

387
00:55:29,834 --> 00:55:34,460
Don't just stand there. Run!
Run the bases!

388
00:55:43,765 --> 00:55:47,680
- Home run!
- All right.

389
00:55:47,894 --> 00:55:52,023
This is it,
you little Belgian Ted Williams.

390
00:55:52,232 --> 00:55:55,566
- Home run!
- Don't get cocky.

391
00:55:55,777 --> 00:56:01,235
I'm about to unleash the dreaded
Teddy Brice knuckle-curve, screwball,

392
00:56:01,451 --> 00:56:05,579
slider-sinker-spinner,
high and tight, low and away,

393
00:56:05,788 --> 00:56:09,573
say your prayers,
beg-for-mamma drop-ball.

394
00:56:09,793 --> 00:56:13,873
- Home run.
- That's it. No mercy.

395
00:56:14,089 --> 00:56:17,174
He checks the runner at first.

396
00:56:17,384 --> 00:56:19,840
He shakes off the signal,

397
00:56:22,431 --> 00:56:26,262
puts a little spin on the ball,
gets his feet ready.

398
00:56:26,476 --> 00:56:28,517
Oh, yeah.

399
00:56:37,989 --> 00:56:41,074
Goodbye, Mr Spalding.

400
00:56:41,285 --> 00:56:42,779
I've won!

401
00:56:42,995 --> 00:56:48,155
I'm calling the Indians.
They're signing you up.

402
00:56:49,459 --> 00:56:51,950
You're a natural, kid.

403
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:56,378
Oh, man, you wore me out.

404
00:56:56,592 --> 00:56:59,878
I have to tell it twice, for Jean.

405
00:57:00,096 --> 00:57:03,631
No, American, English.

406
00:57:05,226 --> 00:57:07,265
Okay, in American.

407
00:57:08,438 --> 00:57:12,685
There was a boy,
and he grew up far away.

408
00:57:13,943 --> 00:57:19,234
All he could see,
wherever he looked, was open.

409
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:23,033
When he ran, he made no sound,

410
00:57:23,244 --> 00:57:28,287
because he ran in rhythm
with the earth.

411
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,743
And he was loved.

412
00:57:32,713 --> 00:57:34,753
I'm awake. Go on.

413
00:57:37,009 --> 00:57:40,592
This little boy became a man.

414
00:57:43,684 --> 00:57:47,634
He made a house with his own hands.

415
00:57:47,855 --> 00:57:52,902
He built a family, also,
and they were never alone.

416
00:57:57,031 --> 00:57:59,153
They were never afraid.

417
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:06,539
When it rained, the sun got brighter.

418
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:10,331
When it snowed, the crops grew.

419
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:19,872
When they were sad, it was only
because it seemed too much

420
00:58:21,389 --> 00:58:24,557
for one family to have all to themselves.

421
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:28,434
They were protected from the dark.

422
00:58:28,648 --> 00:58:33,773
And night never came, because...

423
00:58:33,986 --> 00:58:36,229
...because at midnight...

424
00:58:37,741 --> 00:58:43,245
...at midnight,
all God's angels lit candles

425
00:58:43,454 --> 00:58:47,583
to help them see that this was their gift.

426
00:58:49,086 --> 00:58:54,247
Someone had to be happy, in love,

427
00:58:54,465 --> 00:58:57,301
safe.

428
00:58:58,387 --> 00:59:01,471
Somewhere there had to be peace.

429
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:24,156
A pear.
It's very rare, from Madame Oomlop.

430
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:28,744
Claire, what is it?

431
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:34,672
This Friday they are taking you.

432
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,141
Three days.

433
00:59:49,316 --> 00:59:52,270
It's simple. I won't go.

434
00:59:52,485 --> 00:59:55,771
They will come in the evening,
after dinner.

435
00:59:55,989 --> 00:59:58,860
- You will go with me.
- It's not possible.

436
00:59:59,076 --> 01:00:01,911
You have to go with me,
you and Jean.

437
01:00:02,121 --> 01:00:04,826
- We have not the papers.
- Get the papers.

438
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:10,118
They cannot make them for us.
I am waiting here for my husband.

439
01:00:18,012 --> 01:00:21,097
What are you talking about?

440
01:00:27,605 --> 01:00:32,564
If I leave Henri, it is to denounce him.

441
01:00:32,778 --> 01:00:36,361
Ted, it's not honourable.

442
01:00:36,574 --> 01:00:40,738
The hell with what's honourable.
I make you happy.

443
01:00:40,953 --> 01:00:43,990
- No talk.
- I make you happy.

444
01:00:45,457 --> 01:00:47,498
I make you happy.

445
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,848
You do love him.

446
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:10,059
You could have told me.

447
01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:17,114
I never lied to you. Never.

448
01:01:28,086 --> 01:01:30,792
You have a husband.

449
01:01:46,356 --> 01:01:48,395
Put it on.

450
01:02:06,043 --> 01:02:08,617
I left a note for Jean in French.

451
01:02:08,837 --> 01:02:13,299
Come soon, I wrote. I hope it's right.

452
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:19,429
I need directions. I want a village
where we won't be recognised.

453
01:02:19,641 --> 01:02:23,769
- You know some back roads.
- What are you doing?

454
01:02:23,979 --> 01:02:26,683
Taking you on a date.

455
01:02:40,245 --> 01:02:42,405
I want to go to a cafe.

456
01:02:42,624 --> 01:02:47,784
I want people to see us together,
out in the open, no hiding.

457
01:02:48,003 --> 01:02:50,044
I won't touch you.

458
01:02:50,257 --> 01:02:53,839
I just want to be with you
to make it...

459
01:03:57,619 --> 01:04:03,243
You are totally foolish!
Tell him thank you, and good luck.

460
01:04:06,377 --> 01:04:12,049
She wished us luck, called us foolish,
and she thanked you.

461
01:04:14,721 --> 01:04:18,849
This was stupid. We should go.

462
01:04:20,976 --> 01:04:25,104
I didn't realise there'd be
an arrow pointed over my head.

463
01:04:30,571 --> 01:04:34,984
- I am sorry.
- No. I'm the fool.

464
01:04:36,619 --> 01:04:39,157
I pretended it was real.

465
01:04:44,127 --> 01:04:47,496
I fell in love with another man's wife.

466
01:04:47,714 --> 01:04:51,663
My punishment is that
I'll never be able to forget her.

467
01:04:55,721 --> 01:04:58,807
We have the same punishment.

468
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:07,497
- Don't touch me. I'm covered in mud.
- It doesn't matter. You're alive!

469
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:15,969
- It wasn't wise to leave Delahaut.
- How are the others? Anthoine?

470
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,722
He was captured.

471
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:26,889
We should go.
Tell him to get in the back.

472
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:29,186
His name is Ted.

473
01:06:30,697 --> 01:06:33,781
Please ride in the back of the truck.

474
01:06:46,505 --> 01:06:49,043
My clothes don't suit him.

475
01:06:50,301 --> 01:06:53,753
You must tell me the news.
We've heard so little.

476
01:06:53,972 --> 01:06:57,305
We blew up all the old tunnels.

477
01:06:57,516 --> 01:07:00,518
We blew up the bridges.
We did our job.

478
01:07:00,729 --> 01:07:06,518
I've been to see Oomlop. I know
the American is leaving on Friday.

479
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:09,820
She's mistaken.

480
01:07:10,906 --> 01:07:12,945
He leaves tonight.

481
01:07:18,872 --> 01:07:24,544
You should have missed me
as much as you'll miss him.

482
01:08:05,172 --> 01:08:07,211
You leave tonight.

483
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:16,303
- Hey, buddy.
- Home run.

484
01:08:18,518 --> 01:08:22,101
No, run home.

485
01:09:35,684 --> 01:09:38,554
I'm ready.

486
01:09:41,939 --> 01:09:46,069
Tell him to eat.
We have to leave in 20 minutes.

487
01:09:46,277 --> 01:09:48,485
You have to eat, quickly.

488
01:10:08,218 --> 01:10:11,303
- Jean, help me prepare the truck.
- No.

489
01:10:11,513 --> 01:10:14,549
Let the boy eat. You go ahead.

490
01:10:27,822 --> 01:10:33,064
Tell me, Jean, what happened
while I was away?

491
01:10:38,457 --> 01:10:43,167
- You can tell me. Don't be scared.
- Nothing.

492
01:10:51,597 --> 01:10:54,847
All right, we'll swap stories.

493
01:10:55,059 --> 01:11:00,973
I'll tell you about the Maquis,
the tunnels, the explosions.

494
01:11:01,982 --> 01:11:06,610
You'll tell me what happened
during my absence.

495
01:11:12,744 --> 01:11:14,571
You say nothing.

496
01:11:14,787 --> 01:11:18,917
Henri, thank you for getting me out.

497
01:11:22,254 --> 01:11:25,836
Why is he talking to me
whilst I'm talking to you?

498
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:30,759
What's this soldier got to hide from us?

499
01:11:34,225 --> 01:11:37,179
I'll have to ask my wife.

500
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:42,229
That's what happened.

501
01:11:56,874 --> 01:11:58,914
What does this mean?

502
01:12:52,974 --> 01:12:55,596
Go ahead, tell him.

503
01:12:55,811 --> 01:13:01,716
Henri will hide you in the back of
the truck until the exchange point.

504
01:13:02,234 --> 01:13:07,656
<i>You will take 15 steps into the dark
and say, "Courage".</i>

505
01:13:07,866 --> 01:13:11,565
<i>- Courage.
- In French. Courage.</i>

506
01:13:11,785 --> 01:13:14,158
<i>Courage.</i>

507
01:13:16,542 --> 01:13:19,626
Henri has your papers.

508
01:13:21,255 --> 01:13:24,920
The couriers will explain the rest.

509
01:13:26,344 --> 01:13:27,753
The chocolate?

510
01:13:33,434 --> 01:13:37,894
<i>You say "Courage"
and hand over the chocolate bar.</i>

511
01:13:38,105 --> 01:13:42,233
- My ticket.
- Your ticket home.

512
01:13:42,443 --> 01:13:44,686
Have you told him everything?

513
01:13:44,904 --> 01:13:50,818
- We will always be here, won't we?
- Yes, we will always be here.

514
01:14:12,434 --> 01:14:13,927
Jean...

515
01:14:20,192 --> 01:14:23,275
- Return.
- Sure, kid.

516
01:14:23,487 --> 01:14:27,614
<i>You bet. Retourner.</i>

517
01:14:46,428 --> 01:14:48,005
Come on.

518
01:14:48,221 --> 01:14:52,349
Look at that! Cousins, friends.

519
01:14:52,559 --> 01:14:57,564
Friends, my friends, all dead.
Dead for you!

520
01:14:58,982 --> 01:15:03,063
And Dinant, the nurse... saved you!

521
01:15:04,489 --> 01:15:08,818
And Philippe Jauquet. My friend.

522
01:15:09,035 --> 01:15:11,491
The best.

523
01:15:11,703 --> 01:15:14,408
All dead for you.

524
01:15:14,624 --> 01:15:16,451
Dead.

525
01:15:16,668 --> 01:15:18,707
For you!

526
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:22,039
Now hide!

527
01:15:35,062 --> 01:15:38,894
Come on. Let's go.

528
01:16:03,175 --> 01:16:07,303
<i>- Courage.
- Courage.</i>

529
01:16:49,474 --> 01:16:51,513
I love you, Claire.

530
01:16:55,105 --> 01:16:57,145
<i>Courage.</i>

531
01:17:34,313 --> 01:17:38,440
Perhaps you don't understand.
We'll try again.

532
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:48,531
- Claire Daussois.
- How long have you been a Maquis?

533
01:17:52,665 --> 01:17:57,825
Tell me your husband's name.
Tell me Henri's name.

534
01:17:59,381 --> 01:18:04,209
He gave us the American.
He thought it was enough.

535
01:18:04,428 --> 01:18:07,632
But we need to know
who killed the guards,

536
01:18:07,848 --> 01:18:11,763
and what the codes were
that were on the plane.

537
01:18:11,978 --> 01:18:14,848
Now it's your turn to talk.

538
01:18:16,732 --> 01:18:20,860
Or would you rather see
what happens if you don't?

539
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:28,649
War makes cowards of us all.
What's wrong with you?

540
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:41,633
Was it worth it, Henri,
keeping your mouth shut?

541
01:18:45,013 --> 01:18:49,010
I want names, addresses,
times when they will be at home,

542
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,466
their favourite recipes.

543
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:54,522
I know there is someone
sending messages,

544
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:57,648
someone we somehow overlooked.

545
01:18:58,735 --> 01:19:01,405
Delahaut belongs to the Fuhrer.

546
01:19:01,613 --> 01:19:05,742
We need to get the Belgian virus
out of its veins.

547
01:19:10,455 --> 01:19:13,029
You can help, madame.

548
01:19:13,251 --> 01:19:15,956
You can be Germany's nurse.

549
01:19:17,296 --> 01:19:20,546
Be careful. She must not die... yet.

550
01:19:40,153 --> 01:19:42,691
Let's go home, Major.

551
01:19:42,907 --> 01:19:46,775
Let's see the wife, kids, girlfriend.

552
01:19:48,204 --> 01:19:50,660
Let's go home.

553
01:19:54,878 --> 01:19:57,249
One more time. Who are you?

554
01:19:58,423 --> 01:20:02,089
Major Theodore Brice.

555
01:20:04,263 --> 01:20:07,015
Who hid you in the town of Delahaut?

556
01:20:07,224 --> 01:20:11,056
7216892...

557
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:15,268
What members of the Resistance
did you meet?

558
01:20:15,483 --> 01:20:20,478
Major... Theodore... Brice...

559
01:20:22,198 --> 01:20:25,282
You're starting to get to me, Major.

560
01:20:26,578 --> 01:20:30,706
I'm wanting to end our sessions
permanently.

561
01:20:32,417 --> 01:20:38,253
Why don't you come clean?
It will make you feel so much better.

562
01:20:38,465 --> 01:20:41,170
37216892...

563
01:20:41,384 --> 01:20:44,671
Okay, you'd rather dance.

564
01:20:48,685 --> 01:20:51,554
Lean your head back. Lean back.

565
01:20:56,526 --> 01:21:00,357
Take him to the infirmary
and stop him bleeding.

566
01:21:00,572 --> 01:21:03,443
37216892...

567
01:22:29,416 --> 01:22:33,958
Tell the captain I'm ready.

568
01:23:18,843 --> 01:23:20,881
How do you feel?

569
01:23:24,348 --> 01:23:27,764
You do realise that you're free?

570
01:23:31,146 --> 01:23:33,187
You are free!

571
01:24:39,595 --> 01:24:41,633
Thank you.

572
01:24:59,781 --> 01:25:05,296
- Anthoine, I thought you were dead.
- Almost.

573
01:25:06,706 --> 01:25:08,746
They did their best.

574
01:25:12,921 --> 01:25:16,006
I got some groceries for the shop.

575
01:25:16,216 --> 01:25:21,720
I'll come with you. I'm not ready
to see what's left of my house.

576
01:25:34,945 --> 01:25:40,105
I heard... about Henri.

577
01:25:41,492 --> 01:25:42,986
Yes.

578
01:25:45,456 --> 01:25:47,494
How is Claire?

579
01:25:47,708 --> 01:25:51,621
She has the boy, the farm is recovering.
She'll get by.

580
01:25:51,837 --> 01:25:54,375
- The pilot?
- Killed by the Germans.

581
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:59,216
- But he was an officer.
- He gave them a false code.

582
01:25:59,428 --> 01:26:03,972
And he lied about killing
the guards at the plane.

583
01:26:05,852 --> 01:26:07,890
1lt wasn't him?

584
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:13,228
No.

585
01:26:37,802 --> 01:26:40,886
- It's good to be home.
- Yes.

586
01:26:42,556 --> 01:26:44,596
Yes.

587
01:27:10,669 --> 01:27:13,126
Mother! I'm going flying.

588
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:52,939
- We will always be here, won't we?
- Yes, we will always be here.
