Hello? It's me.
How far have we got?

3
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:48,042
- We're pretty much there.
- We are? I'll say.

00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:51,459
And the doll?
Did you get rid of it?

00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:56,001
Yes, it's been taken care of. You don't need it.

6
00:00:56,167 --> 00:01:00,834
Great.
And what about their main witness?

7
00:01:06,626 --> 00:01:09,292
Don't worry about it.

8
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:16,209
- They don't have a key witness.
- That's what I like to hear.

9
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,001
And the list, do you have it?

10
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:22,667
I got it right here.
All the names and addresses.

There's no loose ends. You are...
halfway to freedom, Eberfrö.

00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:32,626
That's it. That's it. I'd like to see that,
who can stop me now.

It's something I gotta make sure of

32
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:30,542
But I'll ask
If I don't, who the hell will?

- Good morning.
- Good morning, manse.

42
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:18,751
- You want some breakfast?
- Yes, please.

43
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:22,209
- Is it under the cement?
- Hey, you.

44
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:25,417
- Hey!
- Hi, honey.

45
00:03:25,584 --> 00:03:29,042
- So, how'd it go?
- It went great! Sune?

46
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,001
- I'm playing!
- Sune's getting a game...

47
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:36,834
- Come down here! I have good news!
- I'm coming!

48
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:40,417
- Good morning, Aske.
- Good morning, Jørn.

49
00:03:40,584 --> 00:03:44,376
- Oh, Jørn. Didn't we agree...
- It's summer vacation.

50
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:49,751
- Basser! How many can you take?
- Go to it. There must be for Cinderella.

51
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:53,834
- Are they from the vegan bakery?
- No, they're not. Isn't it out of business?

52
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:57,167
- Why do you have paint on your hands?
- Well...

53
00:03:57,334 --> 00:04:01,459
Well, listen, guys. I've been working
with my digestive app.

54
00:04:01,626 --> 00:04:05,667
- and I've hit some speed bumps,
but it's been worth it.

55
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:09,751
- Did you sell it, honey?
- Not just sold it.

56
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:13,376
Nordic Fitness has purchased
the rights and hired me.

57
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:17,167
- as master coach and chief developer
for their nutrition program.

58
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:20,709
But that's amazing!
Jørn as a manager!

59
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:23,042
- Oh, right.
- Congratulations.

60
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:26,376
- Fucking nice, Dad.
- So, Sune. The language.

61
00:04:26,542 --> 00:04:33,209
But that's not the only thing. Voilà.
An advance of 150,000 kroner.

62
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:36,501
That's a fucking lie.

63
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:40,126
Yes, it's just for the hell of it,
or what?

64
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:44,917
I want to celebrate by inviting
you all on a vacation.

65
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:48,376
- Are we going travelling?
- That's fantastic!

66
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:51,042
- Oh, great!
- So where are we going?

67
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:55,876
We have to vote on it,
so I made a suggestion box.

68
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:59,751
- and the idea is that you write
your wish and put it in the...

69
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:04,167
- So you put it in the box?
- Couldn't we come to Spain?

70
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:08,292
Let's think about it,
and we'll use the suggestion box.

71
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:11,917
- There's also something exciting in Germany.
- Or Spain.

72
00:05:12,084 --> 00:05:16,167
- Frankfurt, for example.
- Hey, you need the box, honey.

73
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:21,167
- I know, I know, I know.
- You're amazing, honey.

74
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:24,542
- I can't believe we're going away.
- I know, right?

75
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:27,501
- Yes, whoo!
- Oh, my gosh.

76
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,834
Hi, this is Jessica...

77
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:37,542
...voice mail. I'm on it.
with something important. Please leave a message.

78
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:43,209
Hi, this is Aske. Did you get my
messages? It's been a while...

79
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:47,459
- And I miss you like crazy! Møs!
- Don't do that!

80
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:50,626
- What are you going to vote for?
- Frankfurt.

81
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:54,334
- The hell you are!
- And you don't talk to each other.

82
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:57,376
- Don't you write Spain?
- Why not?

83
00:05:57,542 --> 00:06:00,917
That's where the Spanish pipes come from.
You know, the ones you can eat.

84
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:05,001
- They're only called cane in Denmark.
- They're called churros all over the world.

85
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:09,292
It means fried dough in Spanish.
I googled it.

86
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:12,626
Why are you going to Spain?
You can just go to Tivoli.

87
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:16,292
We can't go on a fucking holiday
in Tivoli. Come on, Aske.

88
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,167
Spain! Spain! Spain!

89
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:23,417
If I write Spain,
will you get out?

90
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:28,542
- Yes! Cool, bro! Two for everybody!
- Mm.

91
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:32,251
Or... Fuck Frankfurt!

92
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:45,001
How long do I have to wait?
There's nothing to get

93
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:49,751
at least equal
if we' okay

94
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:55,917
How cold is your heart?
Every time I check it's

95
00:06:56,084 --> 00:07:00,292
the same I see
on my display

96
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:06,834
Three dots looking at me
For an eternity

97
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:10,667
Three dots
with a power that is quite sinister

98
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:18,167
Three dots, no words
But a clear message

99
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:21,667
Three dots say it all
You'll never know

100
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:31,667
Parkour! Le parkour!
Street movement!

101
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:36,542
Invented in Jamaica by the paperboys
as an antidote to snow.

102
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:40,834
- Yeah! More energy!
- Come on, relax. I guess she writes.

103
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:46,167
Aren't you guys dating? You were standing
kissing at the graduation party.

104
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:50,917
We haven't talked in a week,
and I've written several times.

105
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:54,667
- Why don't you go over there?
- I can't come over.

106
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:59,834
87.5% of all women prefer..,
their partner to be more proactive.

107
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:02,501
Why don't you drive by her on your way home?

108
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:05,959
- Girls love it when you're spontaneous.
- And fragrant.

109
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:09,626
Ash! Concentration!
Have you got that jump under control?

110
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:12,376
Yeah, I got it. No. Not quite.

111
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:15,626
Then it's a bad time
to have a talk club.

112
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:18,709
- Come on, Aske.
- Yeah, you got it this time.

113
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,251
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Whoo-hoo!

114
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:27,084
- Goddamn it!
- Fuck.

115
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:30,876
Ash! Where's your confidence?
Man up.

116
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:35,917
Obstacles aren't real.
They only exist in your mind.

117
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,751
Now get moving!

118
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:50,126
Hey, Jess... What's up, Jessica?

119
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:53,834
Well, I just stopped by
on my way home from practice.

120
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:58,376
You know, uh... I work out.
Yeah, are you crazy?

121
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,209
Goodbye, Aske. I was about
making yellow peas. Want to come in?

122
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:09,917
- Is Jessica home?
- She is.

123
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:13,501
- She's been waiting for you.
- Has she?

124
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,709
She's all dressed up.
for over an hour now.

125
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:20,417
Jessica? It's the prince.
on the white horse!

126
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:24,959
Are you going to taste it? Yellow peas, Cinderella.
There's nothing better.

127
00:09:25,126 --> 00:09:28,042
- I think I'll stand.
- It needs pesto.

128
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:33,876
- Hi, guys. Aske? What are you doing here?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! Well, I'm going to something...

129
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:37,584
- Oh, Jessica's got a guy over!
- What's up, bad boy?

130
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:42,001
- Oh, okay. It's just Aske.
- False alarm after all. Hey, girlie.

131
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:44,792
- Hi, Mie.
- I'm Fie.

132
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,376
- No, that's right.
- Right, sorry. It's me.

133
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:52,417
Hey, honey. Are we too early?
He's not coming, is he?

134
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:55,834
- Well, we agreed no kids, right?
- High-five!

135
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:59,667
- Can you go upstairs?
- If you'd rather be free of us...

136
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:03,459
To get a price tag right in the forehead.
50% off.

137
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:07,501
- Hashtag yellow and free.
- Hashtag used strollers.

138
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:11,584
It's super sweet that you stopped by,
but it's not so good today.

139
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:15,417
- I'm going to a party.
- Can I just come?

140
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:19,501
Yeah, but that's just because
it's some people from high school.

141
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,876
I'm not saying,
you're being childish or anything...

142
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:26,917
- Is that Marco calling?
- No, we're waiting for Jessica.

143
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:31,917
- He's just such a bad boy.
- Jessica, hurry up.

144
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:35,626
Cinderella, I'll see you later.
one of these days, right?

145
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:39,376
Bad boy?

146
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:51,626
- Hello?
- What's up, did you go to Jessica's?

147
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:54,417
No, I just got a little busy.

148
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:58,417
Ulysses?
After everything with Glenn and that...

149
00:10:58,584 --> 00:11:03,459
You don't say,
I was such a bad boy?

150
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:08,709
- Oh, okay. Why is that so funny?
- You're just a different guy.

151
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:13,167
You're like...
You're just so... so Aske.

152
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:15,792
But Glenn and the fight?

153
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:20,209
Bad boy, that's more like it,
how to talk to the girls.

154
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:25,876
Confidence, like. Girls love,
when you're in the driver's seat and you say:

155
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:29,667
- Hey, bitch, this is how it's gonna be!
- Trunte? Okay.

156
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:33,126
- You're so funny, Cinderella. Bad boy.
- Ulysses?

157
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,251
Hello? Ulysses?

158
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:02,792
Ah!

159
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:22,334
You drive like a broken arm,
human.

160
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:28,334
- Is that really you? Ow, damn it!
- Nice to see you.

161
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:31,959
Do you know how much I have
missed you? I thought you were dead.

162
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,792
I fucking am.
I've been dead for 400 years.

163
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,334
- Yeah, but dead.
- I guess you're never really dead.

164
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:42,751
Pick me up.
Something's wrong, human.

165
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:46,459
- I can feel it.
- Shit. Maybe your leg's broken.

166
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:50,626
There must be something wrong with our
mission since I showed up here.

167
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:55,626
- So you didn't come on your own?
- A spirit doesn't go on a social call.

168
00:12:55,792 --> 00:13:00,251
We're bound to each other by a vow
to get revenge on a child killer.

169
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:04,751
- I thought we'd done that.
- We need to find out what happened.

170
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:09,876
But first things first.
Do you have any cold cabbage at home?

171
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:12,792
I didn't think so,
it was a social visit.

172
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,584
Nobody says we can't have it.
while we're getting our revenge.

173
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:19,959
Watch the stomach.
Hedgehogs can't take milk.

174
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:25,626
Fuck milk, I just need
I just need cold cabbage. Well, that's the mission.

175
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:31,709
Hm. "Narcotics-Faced Toy Giant
released. Evidence Gone."

176
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:34,501
- There's something about this.
- In that one?

177
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:36,751
Yeah, hold on.

178
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:46,376
Phillip Eberfrø, who is imprisoned
for murder and drug smuggling.

179
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:50,584
- will now be released, as all evidence
against him has disappeared.

180
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:55,584
The teddy bear has disappeared
from an otherwise guarded evidence warehouse.

181
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,542
I wasn't a teddy bear!

182
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:05,001
Crown witness, children's factory manager
Chan Bam Yu, has been found dead.

183
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:07,376
He's the one with the bamboo stick.

184
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:13,042
A list of ten children who were
witnesses have also disappeared.

185
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:17,209
The prosecution has
has no legal power

186
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:19,792
- to detain Eberfrö.

187
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:25,209
Yet Eberfrø's lawyer,
Carsten Nokken Gahn, is not satisfied.

188
00:14:25,376 --> 00:14:29,876
No, I am not satisfied. The judge
has confiscated Mr Eberfrø's passport.

189
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:33,709
- so he can't leave
Thailand until the case is closed.

190
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:37,501
My client is innocent and has
suffered unnecessarily in prison.

191
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,667
The judge denies
to release him before the 16th.

192
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:42,334
That's next week!

193
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:45,042
A week is a long time in prison.

194
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:50,626
We have to be there.

195
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:54,126
In Thailand? I promised Sune,
we were going to Spain.

196
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:59,626
You promised Eberfrø would go to jail.
You still owe me.

197
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:04,584
Because you pushed Glenn? I'll pay.
rocking interest on that debt?

198
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:09,292
- We still need proof.
- Then we'll have to find some proof.

199
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:12,876
- We can't just do that.
- Hey, we're ninjas.

200
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:15,251
We'll have to improvise.

201
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:20,876
You said "we"?
You said "we" are ninjas.

202
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:25,126
Wouldn't you say that we were
kind of bad boy-ish?

203
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,167
Yeah, well, okay, I'm a ninja.

204
00:15:28,334 --> 00:15:31,251
So I guess
pretty bad boy-ish.

205
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:34,792
- But what am I?
- A kid?

206
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,626
If I'm on the mission,
aren't I also a ninja?

207
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:41,917
Ninja is nothing,
you can become that way.

208
00:15:42,084 --> 00:15:45,084
- It's something you're born to do.
- Well.

209
00:15:45,251 --> 00:15:49,542
But if you help with the mission,
...I suppose it's only fair...

210
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:54,167
- that you, by way of exception.
...you'll be made a ninja apprentice.

211
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:58,417
- Really?
- And that's some bad boy shit.

212
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:02,959
Why don't you start by finding out..,
how to get to Thailand.

213
00:16:03,126 --> 00:16:06,917
Ash? Oh, mommy's little vet.

214
00:16:07,084 --> 00:16:11,417
That's very sweet, but you're
have to keep him in the shed.

215
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:15,542
Jørn has an allergy.
to having an animal in the house.

216
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:21,626
- Is he allergic to hedgehogs?
- Do we have any antihistamines?

217
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:23,959
He has to stay in the shed.

218
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:35,042
You don't mean that.
I can't be here.

219
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:39,834
- Not for long, anyway.
- You need to get into another body.

220
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:42,917
We can't have
a hedgehog on the plane.

221
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:46,501
- I threw out my teddy bears.
- I'm not gonna be a teddy bear!

222
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:51,251
- So is there anything like this?
- And there's something like this.

223
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:54,292
- It's got moving legs.
- And boobs!

224
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:58,001
- I'm not gonna be a bitch.
- The Middle Ages are over.

225
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:02,334
- Girls are just as good as boys.
- Yeah, sewing and cooking.

226
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:04,417
- What? What? What?
- Sew!

227
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:07,751
Who's sick?

228
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:11,334
Ah! Mm!

229
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:15,084
Take a bread-free morning

230
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:18,376
You can't blow
with flour in your mouth

231
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:20,251
Mommy?

232
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,834
celiac gluten free

233
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:26,376
- take it away so you' sweet
- Mom?

234
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:30,251
coeliac
one man's bread another man's...

235
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,709
- Hello! Mommy! Mommy!
- Yes?

236
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:35,917
Can you... Do you remember
my checkered ninja?

237
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:39,584
Yeah, the one from Uncle Stewart?
Where did it go, anyway?

238
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:43,751
I lost it. So I was thinking,
if you could make me a new one?

239
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:48,042
- A ninja doll?
- Same size, button eyes.

240
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:51,126
- You remember what it looked like, don't you?
- Oh, yeah.

241
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:56,626
Actually, I think I have something
some nice plaid over in the batting cage.

242
00:17:56,792 --> 00:18:01,042
Nobody's pulling out! I'm just gonna...
get my camera. It's for the app.

243
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:04,584
It'll be exciting,
where we're going on vacation.

244
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,167
- About that...
- Spain!

245
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:12,292
And remember, you don't talk about the trip.
You can easily influence each other.

246
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:20,584
I'll see you later.
Where's the nudist beach? Olé!

247
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:24,751
Hm... Mom?

248
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:28,751
I saw this super cool movie
on YouTube called...

249
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:31,709
... "Thailand - vegan paradise".

250
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:36,376
- Vegan's?
- Yeah, there's virtually no meat.

251
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:42,001
They're Buddhists and very
concerned with spiritual development.

252
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:44,709
It might be fun to see one day.

253
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:47,917
We're not talking about,
what we're voting for, right?

254
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:50,167
Oh, no, honey.

255
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:53,959
I'm happy, too,
as long as we're together.

256
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:58,709
Then I can walk around
in Frankfurt and eat pork.

257
00:19:02,126 --> 00:19:05,167
Thailand - vegan paradise.

258
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:12,126
THAILAND TRAVEL

259
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:19,876
KAH SI ATH PRISON

260
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:39,042
Siren? Here we go.
We open the suggestion box.

261
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:44,959
Aske, are you coming?
We're gonna play eagle eye!

262
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:53,042
The situation is that there is
four votes left in the ballot box.

263
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:57,501
You can't vote for yourself,
and you can't vote blank.

264
00:19:57,667 --> 00:20:01,042
Yes.

265
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:06,001
So, Fnuggi. We're just gonna
to be here together.

266
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:10,334
I finished your teddy bear.
It's so cute.

267
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:14,251
Frankfurt.

268
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:18,626
Hm. Spain.

269
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:24,209
- What? Thailand.
- Well.

270
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:31,042
Still in disagreement. That is,
the last vote could be decisive.

271
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:33,334
Uh, well?

272
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:36,792
And, uh...

273
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:44,834
- Thailand?
- Whoo! What?

274
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:48,084
- It's exciting, huh?
- Yeah, it's...

275
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:52,584
Thailand, it's expensive... or
far away. And isn't it rainy season?

276
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:57,126
It's the best time to travel
to Thailand. And the cheapest.

277
00:20:57,292 --> 00:21:01,792
See the price of this hotel.
Well, it's just a suggestion.

278
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:06,251
But it's in a great location.
Yeah, I actually booked it.

279
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:08,709
Mommy's little tour guide.

280
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:12,292
- You're a fucking shit, you are!
- Sune!

281
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:16,126
Tell me, have you talked?

282
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:19,251
Well... I'm going out.
and check on the hedgehog.

283
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:23,792
Hi, Jessica. It's me. It's me.
I'm going on vacation here.

284
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:27,667
- but as soon as I get home,
you and I are gonna get together.

285
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:30,626
And that's the way it's gonna be. Trunte.

286
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:38,334
Or you can just call,
when you get this message. Bye.

287
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:42,334
Hey, I got good news!
We're going to Thailand!

288
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:48,834
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

289
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:52,167
It's all that cold cabbage.

290
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:56,126
You're all warm. Your heart.

291
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:59,917
We gotta get you into that new body!

292
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:03,542
Mommy! Mommy! Were you finished
with my ninja doll?

293
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:07,876
Yes, I finished! I hope you like it.
There were some details...

294
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:10,834
It's perfect, Mom. Thank you, Mom.

295
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:15,751
- T.N., I have your body.
- Just put it down.

296
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,501
- You mean just here?
- And then hurry out!

297
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:21,167
- Well...
- Now!

298
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:42,167
Oh, my God. There's
thunder in the air, huh?

299
00:22:42,334 --> 00:22:44,959
- Well, do you like it?
- Oh, well...

300
00:22:45,126 --> 00:22:49,667
Doesn't it just look like the old one?
to a dot?

301
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:54,126
I look like shit!
Such a cock-bitch pattern!

302
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:58,751
- That's all my mother had.
- You don't have fabric like that.

303
00:22:58,917 --> 00:23:03,584
Unless you're building bulletin boards
for Santa Claus. I'm scratching.

304
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:07,751
On the other hand, you are 100% organic.
And now you can move freely.

305
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:12,917
No, I can't. People will think,
I'm a girl. Checkered chick ninja.

306
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:16,626
Doesn't it matter?
It's what's on the inside.

307
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:20,417
What's on the inside? I weigh
the same as Sune. Is it rice?

308
00:23:20,584 --> 00:23:24,167
I think it's yellow peas.
There's nothing better.

309
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:30,001
I'm so heavy in the ass.
And I don't even have a sword.

310
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:35,292
You've got an apprentice. I have...
arranged for us to go to Thailand.

311
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:38,959
So couldn't we just try
to focus on the mission?

312
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:43,542
Oh, for God's sake. You're right, apprentice.
The mission above all.

313
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:50,917
Over land and city
To the ends of the earth

314
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:55,792
Show style
On new and strange ground

315
00:23:55,959 --> 00:24:00,959
Ready for adventure
Get to know yourself

316
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:05,459
put on that smile

# We'll never look back

321
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:37,584
Well, well, well. I'll say, huh?
What do you say, Fnuggi?

322
00:24:37,751 --> 00:24:43,167
I say it's a long way from Spain.
Dibs on the window seat!

323
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:48,292
We must have turned off the air conditioning.
It's going right into my sinuses.

324
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:52,917
Well, there's the notepad.
And a shoe horn.

325
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:57,584
It's quite a hotel,
you found. And at that price.

326
00:24:57,751 --> 00:25:00,709
And what a setting.

327
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:06,417
- What's that cement block?
- The great Kah Si Ath prison.

328
00:25:06,584 --> 00:25:10,751
Why the hell did you choose..,
to live right next to a prison?

329
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:14,417
They have great breakfast. It's supposed to be
I wouldn't be surprised if they had churros.

330
00:25:14,584 --> 00:25:18,667
- And at that price.
- It's cheaper outside the city.

331
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:24,667
And it's a business hotel, so it's
easier to deduct on your taxes.

332
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:29,167
Well, Mother's little accountant.
Come on, Jørn, we'll sleep in here.

333
00:25:29,334 --> 00:25:32,709
Connecting doors. Luxury.

334
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:41,834
- What's up?
- We're in Thailand.

335
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:46,584
- Already? What time is it?
- Quarter to 12. Boar's Frog will be released at 2.

336
00:25:46,751 --> 00:25:50,542
- Okay, good. So we have four...
- Two hours and 15 minutes.

337
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:55,876
- We have to be there on time.
- And what do we do after that?

338
00:25:56,042 --> 00:26:01,042
- Why are you talking to your teddy bear?
- Can't you just mind your own business?

339
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:05,626
How can that be?
is it so gay?

340
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:08,042
Just because it has hearts on it?

341
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:12,292
Both that and a little of that,
that it's just so gay.

342
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:16,584
- So what if it is gay?
- You keep it in your own bed.

343
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:21,376
- You don't think it has taste?
- Yes, it has great taste. In women's clothes.

344
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:29,792
So, what does the squad say?
Who wants to go knock over Thailand?

345
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:36,334
Hello, family. Welcome.
You wanna buy?

346
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:42,584
- Can't we rent scooters, Dad?
- What? No, it's too dangerous.

347
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:48,292
- A drone! Can't I have this?
- Isn't it very expensive, Fnuggi?

348
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:51,501
No meat. I'm a vegetarian.

349
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:56,751
- This one, please.
- Thank you.

350
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:02,667
- Oh, my God, Jørn! Look, fish therapy!
- What?

351
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:06,626
You should try it.
It should be so healthy.

352
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:10,167
- Shouldn't we do it? My treat.
- Okay.

353
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:12,751
Hello. Can we try the fish?

354
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:16,417
You have to take three quarters,
if you want this to work.

355
00:27:16,584 --> 00:27:20,126
- Yes, three quarters.
- Should we wait for that?

356
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:23,417
- I'm really hungry.
- Then you buy that drone.

357
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:27,917
It could be your holiday present.
It's something we usually drive.

358
00:27:28,084 --> 00:27:33,209
- It's not that much fun, is it?
- It's the fish! Oh, it tickles!

359
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:36,501
Don't you just think,
it tickles, Jørn?

360
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:39,917
Well... Hm... No...

361
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:44,917
- Can I walk around alone?
- Alone? Oh, you know...

362
00:27:45,084 --> 00:27:49,542
Sirene, Cinderella is getting big.
He needs to find himself.

363
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,876
All right, then.
Mommy's little lonely wanderer.

364
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:56,751
- Why does Cinderella have to walk alone?
- You can walk around too.

365
00:27:56,917 --> 00:28:02,084
I don't like walking around alone.
Ad, a cat! I hate cats.

366
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:05,626
- Why don't you walk together?
- No! Or...

367
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:08,876
I need
to find myself. Alone.

368
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:12,667
Find yourself?
You're standing right there.

369
00:28:13,584 --> 00:28:15,626
Hm.

370
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:25,626
We made it.
He hasn't come out yet.

371
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:35,001
Case in point: the controversial
toy manufacturer Phillip Eberfrø -

372
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:39,042
- will today be released on bail
from Kah Si Ath prison...

373
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:43,001
- What time is it?
- Five minutes to. I've got something.

374
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:46,584
- For me? What is it? What is it?
- Something you've been missing.

375
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:50,501
- So you're mission ready.
- Is that a sword?

376
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:54,126
But hey, nothing
with killing and blood and stuff.

377
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:58,001
- No, no, no, no, no. What kind of sword is it?
- It's from a video game.

378
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:01,501
So you don't know which one's in.
I bought the last one.

379
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:06,459
The sword isn't just a weapon.
It's the ninja's very identity!

380
00:29:06,626 --> 00:29:11,126
And now it seems
something happening in the back.

381
00:29:14,376 --> 00:29:16,667
This is it!

382
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:18,834
Mr. Boar Frog?

383
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:24,542
- Boar Frog!
- Take me!

384
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:27,959
- Take a look over here!
- Look and listen.

385
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,334
- Boar Frog!
- Hello!

386
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:36,251
- Bye-bye. Hello, hello.
- Can I ask you a question?

387
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:40,084
- How does it feel to be released?
- It's a big day for me.

388
00:29:40,251 --> 00:29:42,709
And for the rule of law.

389
00:29:42,876 --> 00:29:47,126
Excuse me, Phillip.
conditions in Thai prisons?

390
00:29:47,292 --> 00:29:52,917
Are you used to the hotels in Thailand?
I don't think there's much difference.

391
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:57,209
But it's a lot easier to get
a knife in the stomach than a cold coke.

392
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:02,459
- So what's next?
- Now I need a cold coke.

393
00:30:03,584 --> 00:30:08,626
How does it feel to hit
a little boy with a bamboo cane?

394
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:12,959
- It wasn't... I didn't...
- I don't really understand...

395
00:30:13,126 --> 00:30:16,459
Now you're innocent,
until proven otherwise.

396
00:30:16,626 --> 00:30:20,834
And then I think we'll say thank you for now.
Come on, Phillip.

397
00:30:21,001 --> 00:30:25,251
- Mr. Boar Frog!
- I said thank you for today.

398
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:29,959
- Did you kill anyone?
- We need an answer!

399
00:30:30,126 --> 00:30:33,667
- You're not letting him out of your sight!
- Excuse me, sir?

400
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:36,042
Follow that car!

401
00:30:53,626 --> 00:31:00,292
- Welcome, sir. Would you like a table?
- Thank you, sir. The usual.

402
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:07,126
- Just a minute.
- She's cute, huh?

403
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:10,876
Then you should see her little sister.
That's very fucking good...

404
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:15,042
- Hello. Glug, glug?
- A Sprite, please.

405
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:19,084
- Sprite? Okay. How cute.
- What did she say?

406
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:24,376
- She said you looked cool.
- I'm gonna sneak closer.

407
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:28,876
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Be careful. Be careful.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm listening, you're watching.

408
00:31:32,001 --> 00:31:35,334
- There you go.
- You still want a Coke?

409
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:38,876
No way. I'm thinking,
we should have champagne.

410
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:42,042
Something to celebrate.
Here's to freedom.

411
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:44,584
Yeah, cheers.

412
00:31:46,334 --> 00:31:49,917
- Hey, is he looking at us?
- Who's looking at us? That guy?

413
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:54,126
Hello? Yeah, uh...

414
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:57,209
- Phillip, it's just a kid.
- Yes.

415
00:31:57,376 --> 00:32:00,501
You're right.
I guess I'm just a little paranoid.

416
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:03,459
- Sprite for you.
- Very funny.

417
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:09,084
- Hello?
- Hi. Have you come to Thailand?

418
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:13,292
I didn't mean to interrupt.
How are you doing with everything?

419
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:16,542
I'm fine.
But I can't talk now.

420
00:32:16,709 --> 00:32:19,542
Do you have the list of the children's names?

421
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:22,959
It's at the club.
It wasn't easy to get.

422
00:32:23,126 --> 00:32:27,167
- Maybe you talked to Jessica?
- Uh, no. Why?

423
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:31,167
She's got her tongue down her throat.
on that plastic rocker.

424
00:32:31,334 --> 00:32:33,417
What are you talking about?

425
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:37,417
- I'm thinking 20,000 euros for the list.
- All right, then.

426
00:32:37,584 --> 00:32:41,376
- And you'll take care of the kids yourself?
- I got no problem with that.

427
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,376
You've seen the pictures, right?

428
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:48,584
- What pictures?
- You better check them out.

429
00:32:48,751 --> 00:32:53,584
If the police find those kids before you do,
you can kiss your freedom goodbye.

430
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:57,334
- I'm well aware of that.
- As long as we're on the same page.

431
00:32:57,501 --> 00:32:59,792
What the fuck?

432
00:33:00,876 --> 00:33:03,876
- What the hell is she doing?
- Hey! Human!

433
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:09,251
That's what girls do, Cinderella.
They can't resist a bad boy.

434
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:16,167
Are you there?

435
00:33:17,084 --> 00:33:18,709
Aske?

436
00:33:20,084 --> 00:33:22,709
Hello?

437
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:26,459
Let's meet at the club.
You need to look at some ladies.

438
00:33:26,626 --> 00:33:30,542
Right now I'm only interested in
getting my hands on those kids.

439
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:35,501
Uh, that came out wrong.
Shall we say 10:00?

440
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:37,292
- Talk to me.
- Shit!

441
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:41,626
- You can make it to the bank.
- Yeah. Cheers.

442
00:33:45,251 --> 00:33:47,834
You're finished, baby killer!

443
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:53,584
What? What? What? No, thank you. Go away.

444
00:33:55,626 --> 00:33:58,459
- Are you there?
- I gotta run.

445
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:03,334
Thank you.

446
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:07,834
It suddenly got so hot.
I think I'll go home.

447
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:13,292
Okay. I have to get up and train anyway.
I'll see you later. Don't forget the money.

448
00:34:13,459 --> 00:34:16,209
Shit, he's leaving.

449
00:34:16,376 --> 00:34:19,251
- Tuk-tuk, please.
- Go get him!

450
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:23,542
- Are you leaving now? That'll be 50 baht.
- Excuse me, one moment.

451
00:34:23,709 --> 00:34:26,542
Oh no! Oh, shit!

452
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:29,792
- The lawyer!
- Let's go.

453
00:34:32,709 --> 00:34:35,209
- Fuck.
- What the fuck were you doing?

454
00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:38,292
- The mission above all.
- It was Jessica...

455
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:42,001
- Ow! You're scratching.
- On the other hand, I am 100% organic.

456
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:47,084
- Did you hear anything?
- The lawyer's got the list with the kids.

457
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:51,876
Can we get our hands on that list and give it to the
and give it to the cops, we're done.

458
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:54,667
- Where is it?
- It's at the club.

459
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:58,334
- What club?
- Yes, I didn't get a chance to hear that.

460
00:34:58,501 --> 00:35:03,959
- Fuck. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What are we gonna do?
- Tell me, are you asking me?

461
00:35:04,126 --> 00:35:09,542
We can sit here and wait,
for a clue to fall from the sky.

462
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,084
- Did you say "the club"?
- Yes, I said the club.

463
00:35:14,251 --> 00:35:16,417
"Lucky Fucky Club."

464
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:32,459
- Is this where we're eating?
- Yes, it is. A little further down.

465
00:35:32,626 --> 00:35:37,292
- I can't believe you're taking us to dinner.
- Yeah, you surprised me.

466
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:41,084
Oh, well,
you've given us a holiday.

467
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:45,959
- Well, of course I have.
- I feel like giving a little back.

468
00:35:46,126 --> 00:35:50,001
- I don't like you paying.
- But I'd like to.

469
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:54,917
Aske is exploring his role as a man.
It's important we don't get in the way.

470
00:35:55,084 --> 00:36:00,209
- Mommy's little big man-boy.
- This is a festive street.

471
00:36:00,376 --> 00:36:03,584
Hi, it's Jessica.
...answering machine.

472
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:06,959
I'm in the middle of something important,
so leave a message.

473
00:36:07,126 --> 00:36:12,376
Hey, it's me. Can you call me back?
I'd like to talk to you. Bye, then.

474
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:16,126
- Get off the phone!
- What's she thinking?

475
00:36:16,292 --> 00:36:20,501
What are you thinking? Are you okay with..,
with your lady making out with that cream egg?

476
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:24,042
It was on the cheek. It could be,
it was her cousin.

477
00:36:24,209 --> 00:36:29,417
Then that's what you're thinking. Well, then...
you can concentrate on the mission.

478
00:36:29,584 --> 00:36:33,209
Hello, family.
You look like George Michael.

479
00:36:33,376 --> 00:36:36,667
Oh, I don't know about that.
Must be the hat.

480
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:40,667
- Would you like a family photo?
- Oh, my God, they're men.

481
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:44,834
That's funny, Sune.
Come on, let's take a picture with them.

482
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:49,959
- Say orange.
- Do you have something for me?

483
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,959
We're going up here.

484
00:36:56,042 --> 00:37:00,834
- How did you find this place?
- Online. It gets good reviews.

485
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:05,001
- It looks really authentic.
- It's total garbage.

486
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:08,584
- Can we go on the Mac?
- Play on your iPad.

487
00:37:08,751 --> 00:37:13,459
Hello, family.
Can I get you something to drink?

488
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:20,417
- Shouldn't we start with a drink?
- I can just drink water.

489
00:37:20,584 --> 00:37:25,917
- Have a drink. That's my round.
- Really? Mommy's little rascal.

490
00:37:26,084 --> 00:37:30,292
- I'll have three Sprites.
- Then I'll have one of those Sexy Bitch.

491
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:33,751
Then I'd like to ask
this Flaming Boytoy.

492
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:38,667
- I think they're gonna light it on fire.
- Uh, Coke, please.

493
00:37:40,251 --> 00:37:44,834
- I'll start by finding a bathroom.
- Shouldn't we order food first?

494
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:49,334
- It's kind of urgent. Order for me.
- Do you have a racing stomach?

495
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:53,042
- I don't feel so good.
- Couldn't you take this?

496
00:37:53,209 --> 00:37:57,709
And then put a cross next to it
texture that comes closest?

497
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:02,542
I made a profile for each of you.
You'll have your own login.

498
00:38:02,709 --> 00:38:07,334
- once I've sorted out the last
bugs in the family sharing feature.

499
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:10,709
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Ah!

500
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:14,126
Well, um...

501
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:19,042
I'm a guy who fires it off
on the prowl with the rake today.

502
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:24,626
Don't know what I want more
But I'm down with fur or gag

503
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:27,876
- No kids in here.
- My dad's in there.

504
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:32,292
- I said no kids in here.
- Yeah, but my dad's...

505
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:35,251
Fuck off.

506
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:39,042
- Nice work, bad boy.
- What do you want me to do?

507
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:43,459
We gotta find another way in.
There's a window.

508
00:38:43,626 --> 00:38:47,501
I'll jump up and see,
see if there's a way into the club.

509
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:02,917
I think it's the lawyer's office.
Hurry up!

510
00:39:03,084 --> 00:39:07,209
Up there? Well, it's pretty far.
What if we get caught?

511
00:39:07,376 --> 00:39:11,751
The mission first. Do you want to be
ninja, or don't you want to be ninja?

512
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:15,501
Hm.

513
00:39:21,084 --> 00:39:25,126
You don't have to be
make it harder than it is.

514
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:39,667
He must have saved the list here
somewhere. Come on, we gotta find it.

515
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:53,792
Hm.

516
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:59,251
- Kill that one!
- Hey, it's Jessica. Hello?

517
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:02,417
- Hey, Aske, it's Jessica.
- Yes? Hi.

518
00:40:02,584 --> 00:40:06,542
I'm calling because
to hear it from myself.

519
00:40:06,709 --> 00:40:11,751
I think you're really sweet. I'm...
probably more of a different type.

520
00:40:11,917 --> 00:40:17,584
- Okay. You mean like the bad boy type?
- Well, yeah.

521
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:21,126
I would have told you.
the other day, but...

522
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:23,876
Yeah, but you didn't.

523
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:28,042
Oh, come on,
the timing was just a little off.

524
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:30,001
- Seriously? Yeah.
- Ash...

525
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:33,209
I gotta run.

526
00:40:33,376 --> 00:40:35,459
- What are you doing, man?
- Someone's coming.

527
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:39,251
...if you want to keep those fingers,
you have to pay.

528
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:42,584
You want a drink?
Just sit down.

529
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:46,709
I prefer to stand.
I sat down all the time in prison.

530
00:40:46,876 --> 00:40:52,001
- You have to stay in your place.
- It's not like in Denmark.

531
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:54,709
- There was the list.
- That's good.

532
00:40:54,876 --> 00:40:58,209
- And here's the money.
- Yes, thank you.

533
00:40:58,376 --> 00:41:01,959
- This is the only copy of the list?
- It is, yes.

534
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,834
I can't guarantee it,
the DA won't track down the kids.

535
00:41:06,001 --> 00:41:09,417
- Then I'll have to go first.
- That was kind of my point.

536
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:13,542
They're scattered all over Thailand.
The top one is closest to Bangkok.

537
00:41:13,709 --> 00:41:17,459
- So start there.
- With this guy? Honey Bee Tessanie?

538
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:20,459
Yes, it's a girl.

539
00:41:20,626 --> 00:41:25,542
There's no address. Just "Koh
Ho Ann" and then "restaurant" in parentheses.

540
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:30,459
She was adopted by a family
that runs a restaurant on Koh Ho Ann.

541
00:41:30,626 --> 00:41:33,917
- It's a small island near Bangkok.
- I've heard of it.

542
00:41:34,084 --> 00:41:38,084
I know a Dane who owns
a dive centre on Koh Ho Ann.

543
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:43,001
He still doesn't answer the phone.
He's been away for a long time.

544
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,001
Things take time.
Try calling mine.

545
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:49,209
- A Dane?
- He usually interprets for me.

546
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:55,042
- I could pay him a visit.
- It's stupid to involve more than one.

547
00:41:55,209 --> 00:41:58,459
He's somehow
already involved.

548
00:41:58,626 --> 00:42:00,959
What? Tell me...

549
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:05,001
What's going on?

550
00:42:06,876 --> 00:42:10,334
- Who the fuck are you?
- Hello.

551
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:14,834
- Have you seen my football?
- What? Are you Danish?

552
00:42:15,001 --> 00:42:19,459
- No. Or yes. Or what?
- What are you doing here?

553
00:42:19,626 --> 00:42:24,042
I don't like it. Don't you
recognize him? He was at the café.

554
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:27,501
You're right.
Tell me, are you following us?

555
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:30,959
- Answer me when I'm talking to you!
- I can't.

556
00:42:31,126 --> 00:42:35,042
You're right, Phillip.
Get out of here. Watch the list.

557
00:42:37,751 --> 00:42:41,751
- You and I are gonna have a little talk.
- What are you doing, man?

558
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:45,959
I could ask you that.
What are you doing here?

559
00:42:51,334 --> 00:42:53,626
That list is mine.

560
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:02,792
Well, my dad's inside the club,
and then I dropped my ball.

561
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:05,626
- and it bounced in here...

562
00:43:12,584 --> 00:43:16,667
You're full of shit. There's only one
guest at the club, and he's close to 70.

563
00:43:16,834 --> 00:43:20,334
- It could be my father.
- It's good with you.

564
00:43:20,501 --> 00:43:22,167
Say orange!

565
00:43:23,376 --> 00:43:27,917
- You got something for me?
- You got something for me?

566
00:43:28,084 --> 00:43:30,501
- You got something for me?
- Oh!

567
00:43:31,501 --> 00:43:34,251
Maybe you remember better without ears.

568
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:50,292
It might sting too much.

569
00:43:50,459 --> 00:43:52,334
Then this is better.

570
00:44:00,459 --> 00:44:05,917
Now you're gonna answer my questions.
If you're lying... What did you hear?

571
00:44:17,126 --> 00:44:18,251
Fuck!

572
00:44:18,459 --> 00:44:21,084
I didn't hear anything!
I swear to God!

573
00:44:21,251 --> 00:44:26,542
Too bad, kid. Let's hope so,
some of them are baby teeth.

574
00:44:26,709 --> 00:44:32,876
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is this a toilet?
- Get out! Get out! This is private.

575
00:44:33,042 --> 00:44:36,667
Oh, my God. Good word again.

576
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:41,001
- Uncle Stewart!
- The ashtray? What are you doing here?

577
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:47,542
- The boy committed a burglary.
- That's quite a piece of jewelry.

578
00:44:47,709 --> 00:44:52,292
- Is this the whole family or what?
- Piss off, old man.

579
00:44:52,459 --> 00:44:55,959
You know what's annoying about
a quadruple gold ring like that?

580
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:59,876
- It's so tight around the balls!
- Ah!

581
00:45:00,042 --> 00:45:03,334
Watch it, watch it.
I almost spilled my beer.

582
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:07,209
This might not be
a place for a kid your age?

583
00:45:07,376 --> 00:45:10,667
So, hole in one, skipper.

584
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:16,167
Well, cheers! Whoa, whoa. What are you doin
in a place like this, too?

585
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:19,209
I was... I had...

586
00:45:19,376 --> 00:45:22,917
I'm in. I was also
early with the rake.

587
00:45:23,084 --> 00:45:28,501
I remember one time in the pillow room...
No, wait. That was when I was a temp.

588
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:32,334
- You won't tell my mother?
- Not a word.

589
00:45:32,501 --> 00:45:35,042
Where's the family?

590
00:45:35,209 --> 00:45:38,876
- Where is he?
- Isn't he going to take it? Oh, there he is.

591
00:45:39,042 --> 00:45:41,417
Oh, Cinderella. Where have you been?

592
00:45:41,584 --> 00:45:44,709
Out on the terrace,
is there room on the mattress?

593
00:45:44,876 --> 00:45:48,292
- Uncle Stewart!
- Yessirena!

594
00:45:48,459 --> 00:45:52,167
Oh, you smell like booze.
Oh, yummy! Look who I found.

595
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:54,584
- What?
- Dad?

596
00:45:54,751 --> 00:46:00,334
Yeah, the toilet was broken,
so I had to run over to the...

597
00:46:00,501 --> 00:46:05,501
- That's where we bumped into each other.
- What on earth are you doing here?

598
00:46:05,667 --> 00:46:09,667
I'm working. I'm working right now.
it's a federal holiday. Did you order?

599
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:14,917
- Won't you join us, Uncle?
- There's not much room.

600
00:46:15,084 --> 00:46:19,167
I've just eaten, but you can
but you can always squeeze in another bite.

601
00:46:19,334 --> 00:46:23,084
Isn't that right, Rune? Boat-boat.
And what about you, Tonny?

602
00:46:23,251 --> 00:46:28,042
You've got a hat that wants something.
Yes, I wonder what it wants.

603
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:32,001
You've chosen the best restaurant
in all of Soi Cowboy.

604
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:35,917
- You ready to order?
- Yes, a sai bai gai.

605
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:40,209
And then a biki lau with
extra chockbaii without the cilantro.

606
00:46:40,376 --> 00:46:43,751
- Okay. Ma'am?
- Can't you order for me?

607
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:47,376
- Something vegan.
- I'll let you know what you want.

608
00:46:47,542 --> 00:46:52,084
Dai mai tai sai lai bai gai gai
with extra samsai. Yes?

609
00:46:52,251 --> 00:46:55,709
- Flai kai mai?
- No. Just with flai lai.

610
00:46:57,209 --> 00:47:00,917
- And five beers, please.
- You're the only one who drinks beer.

611
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:04,292
I think so.
You order your own drinks.

612
00:47:04,459 --> 00:47:07,876
Then I'll have
one of those Cucumber Cock blocks.

613
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:11,417
I'm gonna try that.
this Purple Rim-Job.

614
00:47:11,584 --> 00:47:13,667
Ad...

615
00:47:15,626 --> 00:47:19,126
- This vegetable is really delicious.
- It's good.

616
00:47:19,292 --> 00:47:23,251
- What's it called?
- That one? It's called porkuplant.

617
00:47:23,417 --> 00:47:27,584
You were about to tell me that.
So you're just gonna stand there and stare into the barrel?

618
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:32,084
Yeah, that's part of it.
Then you check the consistency...

619
00:47:32,251 --> 00:47:37,292
And Jørn is so good, isn't he, Jørn?
He sold it to the gym.

620
00:47:37,459 --> 00:47:42,292
Yes, I just need to get
a proper name.

621
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:46,459
- What did you call it?
- Jørn's app on digestion and bowel movements.

622
00:47:46,626 --> 00:47:51,126
No, it could be more eloquent.
How about "Control the bag"?

623
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:55,042
- Or "Shit with a can"?
- Here's the bill.

624
00:47:55,209 --> 00:48:00,542
- It was actually for you, Aske.
- Are you going to let the kid pay, Jürgen?

625
00:48:00,709 --> 00:48:03,126
Aske invited me today.

626
00:48:03,292 --> 00:48:07,167
- He wanted to go to this place.
- Oh, he did, did he?

627
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:12,626
Janus, should we two grown-up alpha males
in the herd share this?

628
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:17,792
- Well, I think that...
- You have your pride. I'm a guest.

629
00:48:17,959 --> 00:48:21,542
You can take it yourself, Jakob.
Here's to Jakob!

630
00:48:21,709 --> 00:48:25,251
- Cheers, Jakob!
- Jørn. Cheers, cheers.

631
00:48:25,417 --> 00:48:29,209
There's only one question left,
that presses on.

632
00:48:29,376 --> 00:48:34,251
What are we doing tomorrow?
And what time should I pick you up?

633
00:48:35,084 --> 00:48:38,292
I refuse to spend my vacation
with that man.

634
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:42,292
Of course, darling. But it's...
sweet that he wants to show us around.

635
00:48:42,459 --> 00:48:47,417
- I'm calling a family crisis meeting.
- That minibar is so mini!

636
00:48:51,751 --> 00:48:57,292
- What are you thinking? You left me behind.
- I had to go by the list.

637
00:48:57,459 --> 00:49:01,126
We're on a mission!
You'll forget when the phone rings.

638
00:49:01,292 --> 00:49:04,209
You forget everything else.
You let me down!

639
00:49:04,376 --> 00:49:08,459
- Oh, relax. Iodine on. We split up.
- You're kidding.

640
00:49:08,626 --> 00:49:15,251
- Stewart is the best tour guide ever.
- Ha! Then I prefer to get lost.

641
00:49:15,417 --> 00:49:19,167
Sune, can you get Aske?
We have to figure out what we're doing.

642
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:22,292
- You're a bad friend.
- You're a bad ninja.

643
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:26,042
A klutz.
I should have chopped the idiot down.

644
00:49:26,209 --> 00:49:29,667
- Now here we are with no list...
- You didn't get the list?

645
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:34,334
- No, I didn't get it, because I lost it when...
- Okay, so you failed your mission?

646
00:49:34,501 --> 00:49:39,542
- But then you remember the name of the island?
- That's what an apprentice is for!

647
00:49:40,584 --> 00:49:45,126
You don't know how to do that?
Do you have the name of that island?

648
00:49:45,292 --> 00:49:49,709
And what if I don't? Then you have
failed those children like those in the hut.

649
00:49:49,876 --> 00:49:53,751
- Plus me, who you've also failed.
- It was below the belt.

650
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:57,917
- Who are you talking to, Laske?
- My... teddy bear.

651
00:49:58,084 --> 00:50:01,084
- Oh, the girl bear?
- Yes, exactly.

652
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:06,084
- Yeah, it looks a bit fucking girly.
- What? Doesn't it?

653
00:50:06,251 --> 00:50:10,626
- There's a crisis meeting with the adults.
- Okay.

654
00:50:11,584 --> 00:50:14,167
Don't you want to bring it in?

655
00:50:14,334 --> 00:50:19,751
It's okay. It'll be fine.
fine without me. Will you come?

656
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:27,459
Hm.

657
00:50:35,042 --> 00:50:37,959
We're gonna hang on to him.
the whole holiday.

658
00:50:38,126 --> 00:50:41,667
If you don't want to be with him,
I'll let you know.

659
00:50:41,834 --> 00:50:45,209
- You're not gonna mention me, are you?
- No.

660
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:49,834
You know Uncle Stewart. He stays
hurt if we don't want to see him.

661
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:55,501
- Then he must be hurt.
- Yes, but he can get very angry.

662
00:50:55,667 --> 00:50:59,459
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What do we do? What do we do?
- Oops.

663
00:50:59,626 --> 00:51:04,001
I have an idea. I've found
this wonderful place.

664
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:07,709
A small island, not far from Bangkok.
It's called Koh Ho Ann.

665
00:51:07,876 --> 00:51:11,167
- We were going to have churros.
- We won't make it.

666
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:16,417
There's a small ferry from Bangkok
to Koh Ho Ann once a day.

667
00:51:16,584 --> 00:51:20,542
- So we have to leave tomorrow at 8.
- Then we're in a hurry.

668
00:51:23,084 --> 00:51:26,626
- Have you seen my lenses?
- You don't wear lenses.

669
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,626
I've got them!

670
00:51:28,792 --> 00:51:33,501
- Then we'll be on our way, Uncle.
- My underpants, Dad!

671
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:36,376
We'll catch a ferry in the morning.

672
00:51:36,542 --> 00:51:40,792
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Was he very angry?

673
00:51:40,959 --> 00:51:45,834
No, he wasn't. He could understand,
that we wanted to move on.

674
00:51:56,751 --> 00:51:59,626
Dibs on the window seat!

675
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:04,001
Ha ha. That's it!

676
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:13,334
- There are no more tickets.
- All tickets have been collected.

677
00:52:13,501 --> 00:52:17,626
- I've reserved four.
- Who could have taken them?

678
00:52:17,792 --> 00:52:22,001
Good morning on the pier,
are there crabs in your dress?

679
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:26,876
- Uncle Stewart! What are you doing here?
- You forgot to order for me.

680
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:32,292
Well, it worked out.
They had one left. Shall we?

681
00:52:32,459 --> 00:52:38,167
Nice barge. Just like you, Sirene.
It suits you with a hangover.

682
00:52:38,334 --> 00:52:42,834
I was so fucking touched when you called
and told me we were leaving.

683
00:52:43,001 --> 00:52:46,292
That's a nice pair of shoes.

684
00:52:46,459 --> 00:52:49,917
Piss good with the hat.
Real jydeski.

685
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:54,917
They add that last desperate touch
of a midlife crisis real estate agent.

686
00:52:55,084 --> 00:52:58,417
No, no, no, no, no, no. What? Well, I've tried that.

687
00:52:58,584 --> 00:53:04,709
I thought you booked
for me. There are no more tickets.

688
00:53:04,876 --> 00:53:07,876
I can't go.
until tomorrow morning.

689
00:53:08,042 --> 00:53:10,584
Yes!

690
00:53:10,751 --> 00:53:15,251
- Let's weigh anchor!
- Dad, can we rent scooters on the island?

691
00:53:17,334 --> 00:53:22,501
- Oh, I feel a little sick.
- I want turtle meat.

692
00:53:23,751 --> 00:53:27,334
- Ad, Sirene!
- Yes, there was a headwind, Jan.

693
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:35,292
- Would you like something to drink?
- Yessir, five beers, please.

694
00:53:35,459 --> 00:53:38,459
I'll try.
one of those Long Island Iced Teas.

695
00:53:38,626 --> 00:53:41,584
- Make it a double.
- It's tea, right?

696
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:45,209
- Just one more cabin for you.
- You guys are so cute.

697
00:53:45,376 --> 00:53:50,126
- I can lie in the crack between you.
- That's all I needed.

698
00:53:50,292 --> 00:53:55,251
- We can talk about that, Sirene.
- I've been to the Eiffel Tower too.

699
00:53:55,417 --> 00:53:59,001
Hello, ladies.
You want to rub my backside?

700
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:02,251
I'll rub your front.

701
00:54:02,417 --> 00:54:05,042
Oh, right. Delicate crickets.

702
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:08,167
- King Cobra Farm?
- King Cobra Park?

703
00:54:08,334 --> 00:54:12,084
- Very good.
- Yes, please.

704
00:54:13,126 --> 00:54:16,917
This place is great, huh?
How's your cabin?

705
00:54:17,084 --> 00:54:20,459
- Super.
- Look, a zoo with snakes.

706
00:54:20,626 --> 00:54:23,584
- Exciting, huh?
- A farm? Okay.

707
00:54:23,751 --> 00:54:26,959
- Aren't you going to the beach?
- We are at the beach.

708
00:54:27,126 --> 00:54:29,501
- Outdoors.
- Outside is garbage.

709
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:33,292
- Jørn bought cinnamon potions...
- Dibs for the first one!

710
00:54:33,459 --> 00:54:37,959
- Are you going in the water?
- No, I want to look around.

711
00:54:38,126 --> 00:54:41,626
Oh, Mommy's little adventurer.

712
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:46,417
- Well, enjoy your sightseeing.
- I'm going to find Honey Bee.

713
00:54:46,584 --> 00:54:50,417
- Good luck with that.
- There's only 12 restaurants on the island.

714
00:54:50,584 --> 00:54:56,001
- I'll find her.
- You got it. I'm gonna stay here.

715
00:54:56,167 --> 00:55:00,251
I don't want you here.
You're just leaving me. Again.

716
00:55:00,417 --> 00:55:05,626
And then when you fail again, I'll chop
when he comes tomorrow.

717
00:55:05,792 --> 00:55:08,292
- Fine! Fine! Fine!
- All right! All right!

718
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:18,751
It's important not to dehydrate.

719
00:55:18,917 --> 00:55:22,251
Yeah, I'm focused on that.
Cheers, Hjalmar.

720
00:55:22,417 --> 00:55:26,167
- Are you leaving now?
- I just have to buy a soda.

721
00:55:26,334 --> 00:55:29,126
I'll come too.
I need some chips.

722
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:33,834
- I'll get some for you, okay?
- Tell me, don't you want me?

723
00:55:34,001 --> 00:55:36,459
No, not really, okay?

724
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:41,251
Why don't you leave me alone instead?
instead of following me around?

725
00:55:41,417 --> 00:55:46,792
I don't know what you're doing.
But I'll figure it out.

726
00:55:52,751 --> 00:55:56,959
Excuse me?
I'm looking for a girl. Honey Bee?

727
00:55:57,126 --> 00:56:01,042
- No. No, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

728
00:56:01,209 --> 00:56:03,584

- Honey?
- Yes. Honey Bee.

740

- Like this?
- Oh!

742
00:56:50,209 --> 00:56:54,834
I don't get it. That was
the last restaurant on the island.

743
00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:59,292

- Ow!

744
00:56:59,542 --> 00:57:04,084
Oh no! I'm so sorry.

Yes, please. I own the place.
dive center here on the island.

748
00:57:17,251 --> 00:57:20,292
- Jeppe.
- Aske.

749
00:57:20,459 --> 00:57:24,917
- Dive center... Do you speak Thai?
- Yes, fluently.

750
00:57:25,084 --> 00:57:27,792
- So you're an interpreter too?
- Uh, yes...

751
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:31,959
I think you and I need to have a talk.
About a mutual acquaintance we have.

752
00:57:32,126 --> 00:57:34,459
- Who's that?
- Phillip Eberfrø.

753
00:57:34,626 --> 00:57:36,792
Ah...

754
00:57:38,334 --> 00:57:42,667
I would have said something, but I was
afraid of what he might do.

755
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:46,417
- And then he went to jail.
- But now he's free.

756
00:57:46,584 --> 00:57:50,084
- And now he's coming after the kids.
- That's terrible.

757
00:57:50,251 --> 00:57:53,251
- And he's coming tomorrow?
- His first victim is Honey Bee.

758
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:56,626
- She lives here on the island.
- Where?

759
00:57:56,792 --> 00:58:01,917
She lives with a family that has a
restaurant. I've been everywhere.

760
00:58:02,084 --> 00:58:05,376
Listen, Aske.
That man must be stopped.

761
00:58:05,542 --> 00:58:09,459
- I'll do everything I can.
- Could you find Honey Bee?

762
00:58:09,626 --> 00:58:13,542
I know everybody.
Give me a little time to make some calls.

763
00:58:13,709 --> 00:58:16,292
I'll meet you here at 6:30.

764
00:58:17,251 --> 00:58:20,792
I found the interpreter!
From the children's factory. Jeppe.

765
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:24,376
He ran into me on his scooter.
He'll help us.

766
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:28,001
- With finding Honey Bee.
- So you've told?

767
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:32,084
Calm down. He also wants
the shovel under the Boar's Seed.

768
00:58:32,251 --> 00:58:36,334
- We're supposed to meet him at...
- What time?

769
00:58:37,792 --> 00:58:41,292
- Tell me, did you tamper with the drone?
- Me? No, you didn't.

770
00:58:41,459 --> 00:58:44,459
Why is it glowing red?

771
00:58:44,626 --> 00:58:49,042
- We're blown.
- Multiply that by ten, bitches!

772
00:58:49,209 --> 00:58:53,876
- I'm... I'm...
- Hello. How does it do that?

773
00:58:54,042 --> 00:58:57,834
- Sune...
- Magic or demonic powers?

774
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:00,751
I think you've had too little water.

775
00:59:00,917 --> 00:59:05,209
Or maybe I'm just...

00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:17,542
Ow! Ow! Ow!

779
00:59:17,751 --> 00:59:20,251
- Stop!
- I'm gonna kill him!

780
00:59:20,417 --> 00:59:22,751
Hurry up and apologize!

781
00:59:22,917 --> 00:59:26,876
- Now, goddamn it!
- Oh, yeah. Slap off. I'm sorry.

782
00:59:27,042 --> 00:59:32,001
- Next time you're finished!
- Then you stop. Now we're talking nicely.

783
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:36,001
- It can talk and move!
- I'm not a "it"!

784
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:39,917
- What do you say? He or she?
- Just try saying "she".

785
00:59:40,084 --> 00:59:43,126
- T.N. is a warrior...
- What does it stand for?

786
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:47,167
Don't say it.
He's too stupid to hear it.

787
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,459
"Bitch"?

788
00:59:49,626 --> 00:59:55,167
We're in the middle of a mission. We're on a mission.
life or death for a lot of kids.

789
00:59:55,334 --> 00:59:59,334
- It's important you don't tell.
- I understand.

790
00:59:59,501 --> 01:00:02,667
- I won't tell anyone.
- I'm not gonna tell anybody.

791
01:00:02,834 --> 01:00:05,876
- That is, if you'll take me.
- I'll take you.

792
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:10,876
We're not bringing that nerd.
We don't know if we can trust him.

793
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:15,167
- Plus, he's piss ugly.
- I don't have hearts on my clothes.

794
01:00:15,334 --> 01:00:19,917
- No, you have gravy.
- You're done keeping me out.

795
01:00:20,084 --> 01:00:24,417
I think it would be great...
Could you stay here and keep watch?

796
01:00:24,584 --> 01:00:28,751
It's important to keep watch,
while I talk to Jeppe.

797
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:32,709
- If you dare sit out here alone?
- I'd be happy to.

798
01:00:32,876 --> 01:00:35,542
Ad! A cat!

799
01:00:35,709 --> 01:00:40,584
- Do you have the nerve for this?
- Does T.N. stand for "pretty cute"?

800
01:00:40,751 --> 01:00:45,001
You look a little like a baby kangaroo,
sitting there in that bag.

801
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:47,959
- Hey, hey, hey! Watch the cat!
- Ah!

802
01:00:48,126 --> 01:00:53,584
- I'm going in. Sune, you give the signal.
- Aye, aye, sir.

803
01:00:58,667 --> 01:01:02,542
- Hi, Jeppe.
- What? Hi, Aske. Come in.

804
01:01:02,709 --> 01:01:06,417
- Well, did you get any?
- You bet I did.

805
01:01:06,584 --> 01:01:11,334
- Hello. I took an earlier boat.
- Yes, my boat.

806
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:17,042
You may not think I saw you at
at the ferry? I'll need your phone.

807
01:01:17,209 --> 01:01:20,959
Good work, Jeppe.
And did you have the address of the girl?

808
01:01:21,126 --> 01:01:27,334
- You? So it was all a setup?
- I'm sorry. I owe money.

809
01:01:30,417 --> 01:01:32,501
You're not gonna hurt him?

810
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:37,126
You're not interested in,
in me going to prison for the rest of my life?

811
01:01:37,292 --> 01:01:42,209
- They're gonna kill me!
- Shut the fuck up!

812
01:01:42,376 --> 01:01:46,292
- You are so done, bitch face!
- Fuck!

813
01:01:46,459 --> 01:01:48,292
What?

814
01:01:49,292 --> 01:01:51,501
- No!
- What?

815
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:56,417
- You think that's gonna stop me?
- What the fuck?

816
01:01:56,584 --> 01:01:58,667
What's going on, man?

817
01:01:58,834 --> 01:02:02,792
- T.N.! No!
- Man...

818
01:02:07,126 --> 01:02:09,417
Thank you, puppet show.

819
01:02:09,584 --> 01:02:13,792
Carsten, shouldn't we go out
and have dinner with the Honey Bee?

820
01:02:13,959 --> 01:02:18,292
Yeah, I'll just...
a cup of coffee for the kid.

821
01:02:20,501 --> 01:02:24,126
- What are you doing, dickhead?
- It can jump in the air.

822
01:02:24,334 --> 01:02:30,251
- What's with the weird teddy bear?
- Looks like the factory one.

823
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:34,709
- Only in an incredibly girly version.
- Fuck you, you horse cock eater!

824
01:02:41,751 --> 01:02:44,751
- Hey! Let's go, let's go, let's go. Into the depot.
- Let go!

825
01:02:44,917 --> 01:02:49,417
You're the one moving your mouth.
Points for controlling it without hands.

826
01:02:49,584 --> 01:02:54,501
That's not cool. I don't want to be
to leave the boy here.

827
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:59,334
Neither are you. All witnesses
must be removed. Didn't I tell you?

828
01:03:00,876 --> 01:03:04,334
You two have a good time?
We're gonna find Honey Bee.

829
01:03:04,501 --> 01:03:07,959
- Don't forget to cover your ears.
- No! No! No! No! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

830
01:03:08,126 --> 01:03:13,042
Somebody help! Somebody help! Sune!

831
01:03:14,376 --> 01:03:16,876
Oh! Mm.

832
01:03:18,459 --> 01:03:20,292
Mm!

833
01:03:20,459 --> 01:03:25,209
- Help! Help!
- Sune!

834
01:03:26,751 --> 01:03:30,542
- It's hopeless.
- No, we must not lose heart.

835
01:03:30,709 --> 01:03:37,126
The criminals want to kill Honey Bee,
and we're trapped in a dive shop.

836
01:03:37,292 --> 01:03:40,542
- Get us out of here!
- What could I do?

837
01:03:40,709 --> 01:03:45,126
Now's the time to show,
what you're made of, apprentice.

838
01:03:45,292 --> 01:03:49,417
I'm no good at anything. You said
You said it yourself. I'm just a kid.

839
01:03:49,584 --> 01:03:51,917
- Did I say that?
- You were right.

840
01:03:52,084 --> 01:03:55,626
The hell I wasn't.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.

841
01:03:55,792 --> 01:04:00,709
- Look how far we've come.
- I wouldn't have got anywhere without you.

842
01:04:00,876 --> 01:04:04,834
I can't do this alone.
I'm not a ninja.

843
01:04:05,001 --> 01:04:10,584
And I'm not a bad boy.
I'm just... Ash.

844
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,834
- You're right.
- What?

845
01:04:13,001 --> 01:04:17,126
You're just Cinderella.
But do you want me to tell you something?

846
01:04:17,292 --> 01:04:22,667
You don't have to be anything else.
You're exactly what you're supposed to be.

847
01:04:22,834 --> 01:04:27,667
And you may not even
see that. But I can see it.

848
01:04:27,834 --> 01:04:32,251
You arranged the trip to Thailand,
and you remembered the name of...

849
01:04:32,417 --> 01:04:35,876
- Koh Ho Ann?
- The island, yes. And you got us here.

850
01:04:36,042 --> 01:04:40,084
Yes, and I told Jeppe,
and I got us locked in here.

851
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:46,042
I lost ten kids on my watch.
I don't know if I want to lose another one.

852
01:04:46,209 --> 01:04:49,751
Then don't bother.
shooting yourself?

853
01:04:49,917 --> 01:04:53,167
And then get us out of here.

854
01:04:58,251 --> 01:05:02,209
- I got an idea.
- There you go.

855
01:05:02,376 --> 01:05:05,959
But I'm gonna
to tear your eyes out a little bit.

856
01:05:07,334 --> 01:05:11,334
I'm serious, man. You're walking away. Mm.

857
01:05:11,501 --> 01:05:13,751
Three, two, one.

858
01:05:13,917 --> 01:05:17,251
You put them back on.
That's bullshit.

859
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:21,542
- If they get lost, I'll chop you.
- Good luck with that.

860
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:25,209
- I'm gonna give you a little prick.
- Uh!

861
01:05:25,376 --> 01:05:28,792
- You ready?
- I gotta pee. Fire, damn it!

862
01:05:34,667 --> 01:05:37,126
Sune? Sune?

863
01:05:37,292 --> 01:05:40,584
- Hello?
- What? Who's calling?

864
01:05:40,751 --> 01:05:44,542
Here, damn it. Sune! Look now!

865
01:05:44,709 --> 01:05:47,251
Make noise!

866
01:05:49,459 --> 01:05:52,126
Aske is locked in the store.

867
01:05:52,292 --> 01:05:55,167
Hurry up. Turn off the stove.

868
01:05:56,251 --> 01:06:00,792
- Where's Aske?
- I'm here! I'm here! Sune! Well done.

869
01:06:00,959 --> 01:06:04,834
- Let's go after them.
- We have to get Jeppe out.

870
01:06:05,001 --> 01:06:09,126
He can fucking die here.
We have to get him out on the street.

871
01:06:09,292 --> 01:06:13,334
He sold you to those psychos.
The mission above all!

872
01:06:13,501 --> 01:06:18,167
It's not just about the mission.
We have to be able to look ourselves in the eye.

873
01:06:18,334 --> 01:06:22,501
Take hold, Sune. One, two, three!

874
01:06:26,792 --> 01:06:31,376
- Didn't you turn off the stove?
- Yes, I did. I pulled the plug out of the wall.

875
01:06:31,542 --> 01:06:34,209
It was the wrong plug! Get out!

876
01:07:02,126 --> 01:07:03,876
- There they are!
- Where? Where?

877
01:07:04,042 --> 01:07:08,167
- Right there!
- I'm temporarily visually impaired.

878
01:07:08,334 --> 01:07:12,042
- They just drove past us in a car.
- Then we'll never catch them.

879
01:07:12,209 --> 01:07:16,959
- We have no idea where they're going.
- That... restaurant...

880
01:07:17,126 --> 01:07:19,626
Cobra Farm?

881
01:07:21,292 --> 01:07:26,959
"The restaurant opens tonight."
That's why it's not on the map.

882
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:30,042
- Hurry up...
- Scooter! Yes!

883
01:07:34,042 --> 01:07:37,292
It's going pretty fast, huh?

884
01:07:37,459 --> 01:07:41,334
- Is it still just straight ahead?
- Yeah, just follow the road.

885
01:07:42,501 --> 01:07:45,626
If it's straight,
let me know before you turn.

886
01:07:45,792 --> 01:07:48,209
Look out! Look out! Oh, shit!

887
01:07:48,376 --> 01:07:52,709
- You'll have to take my chocolate lentils.
- You always think about stuffing yourself?

888
01:07:52,876 --> 01:07:55,876
- That was for filling you up.
- You're a genius!

889
01:07:56,042 --> 01:07:59,417
- What? Well...
- Of course!

890
01:08:00,584 --> 01:08:05,959
We're looking for King Cobra Farm?
In English, please.

891
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:11,751
- Is this it?
- No, up ahead on the left.

892
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:18,084
- But, uh... Carsten! Hurry up!
- What?

893
01:08:21,667 --> 01:08:26,376
- Shit! He's seen us!
- Hurry up and get me patched up.

894
01:08:29,501 --> 01:08:32,751
- That's it. That's it.
- That's better. You got my eyes?

895
01:08:32,917 --> 01:08:36,542
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Sune, turn at the sign!

896
01:08:38,667 --> 01:08:41,376
Damn it.

897
01:08:41,542 --> 01:08:43,584
- They're still in.
- What do we do?

898
01:08:43,751 --> 01:08:46,792
- We have to shake them off.
- How?

899
01:08:46,959 --> 01:08:51,001
- There! Up the jungle path.
- Okay, hold on.

900
01:08:57,126 --> 01:09:01,209
- Damn!
- The boys will be fine. After the girl!

901
01:09:01,376 --> 01:09:03,459
Ah!

902
01:09:05,084 --> 01:09:07,959
- Are those eyes coming?
- Yes. Two seconds.

903
01:09:12,626 --> 01:09:15,542
- There, I can see.
- Fuck! Sorry!

904
01:09:15,709 --> 01:09:18,834
Did you drop it?
Then you be careful with the other one.

905
01:09:19,001 --> 01:09:22,626
- Hurry up!
- Okay, that's good enough.

906
01:09:23,584 --> 01:09:26,667
Hey, it's important
not to dehydrate.

907
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:30,209
Yes! Well done!

908
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:33,001
Watch out!

909
01:09:33,167 --> 01:09:36,042
- They're shooting.
- Good eye, Fnuggi.

910
01:09:48,959 --> 01:09:51,917
- It must be in there.
- Here they come.

911
01:10:04,292 --> 01:10:06,542
Go, go, go! Come on! Come on!

912
01:10:18,501 --> 01:10:23,709
I said: "You better have
that laundry ready on Friday, Grandma."

913
01:10:23,876 --> 01:10:25,959
Thank you.

914
01:10:36,459 --> 01:10:39,251
- Up the stairs!
- Okay.

915
01:10:46,917 --> 01:10:48,751
What?

916
01:10:58,209 --> 01:11:01,542
- What's going on, man?
- Uh...

917
01:11:02,459 --> 01:11:06,667
Ha! He can't make her
anything here with all these witnesses.

918
01:11:14,959 --> 01:11:16,417
Shit!

919
01:11:25,917 --> 01:11:29,001
I got her, Phillip. Get the car.

920
01:11:34,126 --> 01:11:38,042
- Forward, apprentice!
- Sune, after Eberfrö. Hurry!

921
01:11:51,917 --> 01:11:54,417
- Phillip, here.
- Great.

922
01:11:54,584 --> 01:11:56,876
- Hey!
- I got her.

923
01:11:57,042 --> 01:11:59,251
Ow, damn it!

924
01:11:59,417 --> 01:12:02,792
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Shoot, Carsten.

925
01:12:02,959 --> 01:12:05,792
Olé, motherfucker!

926
01:12:08,584 --> 01:12:10,792
Shit kids!

927
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:20,626
Fuck! Sune!

928
01:12:22,542 --> 01:12:27,584
I'll help him. You have to save the girl.
We're not leaving anyone behind, are we?

929
01:12:28,626 --> 01:12:31,584
You little... You're finished.

930
01:12:32,459 --> 01:12:34,542
And you're ugly.

931
01:12:42,667 --> 01:12:44,376
Hm.

932
01:13:06,876 --> 01:13:08,751
Ah!

933
01:13:29,292 --> 01:13:31,751
Honey Bee?

934
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:42,709
Honey Bee?

935
01:13:46,209 --> 01:13:48,751
He's gone. He's gone.

936
01:13:49,917 --> 01:13:53,042
It's okay.
I've come to help you.

937
01:13:54,584 --> 01:13:57,042
Huh?

938
01:13:57,209 --> 01:13:59,542
Fooled again.

939
01:14:06,417 --> 01:14:09,626
- That's it! That's it!
- I got this. Go, go, go!

940
01:14:09,792 --> 01:14:12,292
Aye, aye, skipper.

941
01:14:18,542 --> 01:14:19,084
Fuck.

942
01:14:19,251 --> 01:14:22,709
Aske! Aske, you in there?

943
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:27,126
- We're here, Sune!
- Open up! Open up!

944
01:14:27,292 --> 01:14:29,417
Die, teddy bear.

945
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:34,792
- What?
- What?

946
01:14:36,709 --> 01:14:40,626
I... I... am... not...
any... teddy bear!

947
01:14:43,626 --> 01:14:46,584
Ah, shit.

948
01:14:46,751 --> 01:14:49,792
You're not getting away with this.
You left your mark.

949
01:14:49,959 --> 01:14:54,626
There's plenty of gas cans.
I'll burn the whole barn down.

950
01:14:54,792 --> 01:14:58,459
- Don't you touch her!
- We'll start with you.

951
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:02,751
What?

952
01:15:02,917 --> 01:15:05,167
Take that, motherfucker.

953
01:15:11,126 --> 01:15:13,792
Way to go, Cinderella! Watch out! Watch out!

954
01:15:27,876 --> 01:15:30,209
Yes! Get the gun, Aske!

955
01:15:35,042 --> 01:15:37,792
- Stop!
- What?

956
01:15:37,959 --> 01:15:41,584
You stop! I'll shoot!

957
01:15:49,167 --> 01:15:51,376
Oh, no! Oh, no!

958
01:15:58,084 --> 01:16:01,334
Ouch! Ouch!

959
01:16:22,084 --> 01:16:24,751
Way to go, bro!

960
01:16:30,542 --> 01:16:33,709
- What about the lawyer?
- We took care of him.

961
01:16:33,876 --> 01:16:37,459
Or you did. I figured it out,
what T.N. stands for.

962
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:41,751
- Top Nice.
- You saved our ass with that drone.

963
01:16:41,917 --> 01:16:47,084
Oh, yeah. And I got it all on camera.
and livestreamed it to the web.

964
01:16:47,251 --> 01:16:52,292
Now anyone and everyone can see
of an idiot Boar Frog he is. Or was.

965
01:16:53,334 --> 01:16:55,209
What?

966
01:16:56,001 --> 01:16:59,167
Hello? Yes, hello. What?

967
01:16:59,334 --> 01:17:02,459
Yes, he's here. Yeah, hold on.

968
01:17:02,626 --> 01:17:05,917
It's for you, Cinderella.
It's Jessica.

969
01:17:08,834 --> 01:17:11,834
- Hello?
- Hi, Aske. It's Jessica.

970
01:17:12,001 --> 01:17:18,542
I saw where you kicked the gun
out of that creep's hand.

971
01:17:18,709 --> 01:17:22,959
- It was like you were someone else.
- Okay. And then you called?

972
01:17:23,126 --> 01:17:27,876
- Because I seemed like someone else?
- No, but you're a total bad boy.

973
01:17:29,459 --> 01:17:33,376
No, I'm not a bad boy. I'm just Cinderella.

974
01:17:36,459 --> 01:17:38,542
Honey Bee.

975
01:17:40,042 --> 01:17:42,501
- I gotta run.
- Are you okay?

976
01:17:42,667 --> 01:17:45,251
Yeah, me? Yeah, I'm all right.

977
01:17:45,417 --> 01:17:49,084
But come on,
the timing's just a little off.

978
01:17:49,251 --> 01:17:51,334
- What?
- Oh, what!

979
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:55,042
- Hashtag the one that got away.
- Hashtag the train has left.

980
01:17:55,209 --> 01:17:58,917
- Hashtag gingerbread!
- Hashtag Gone with the Wind.

981
01:17:59,084 --> 01:18:01,709
Hashtag Sliding Doors.

982
01:18:02,709 --> 01:18:04,959
- Uh! Ow!
- Luxury.

983
01:18:05,167 --> 01:18:10,209
- Thanks, guys.
- Churros! Total happy ending.

984
01:18:10,376 --> 01:18:14,626
That's fucking great.
You guys get me a free dinner.

985
01:18:14,792 --> 01:18:19,167
- They saved a little girl, Uncle.
- Yeah, that's all right.

986
01:18:19,334 --> 01:18:23,917
- Mommy's little superhero.
- Yeah, and Daddy's little...

987
01:18:24,084 --> 01:18:28,626
- Kongecobra?
- No meat for me. I'm vegan.

988
01:18:28,792 --> 01:18:33,001
It's neither fish nor fowl.
It's gotta count as a vegetable.

989
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:37,584
- No, Uncle. Meat is meat.
- As they say at the Damhus restaurant.

990
01:18:37,751 --> 01:18:40,251
Are you typing in some poop?

991
01:18:40,417 --> 01:18:43,667
I'm developing
...a recognition software...

992
01:18:43,834 --> 01:18:48,042
- that can help you
to categorize. Kind of like Vivino.

993
01:18:48,209 --> 01:18:53,126
You take a picture of the calorie,
and your phone recognizes...

994
01:18:53,292 --> 01:18:56,501
- Oh, James!
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

995
01:18:56,667 --> 01:18:59,917
You're supposed to be rotting.
with Shazam.

996
01:19:00,084 --> 01:19:02,876
Hello, hello, hello. Are you there?

997
01:19:03,584 --> 01:19:05,751
T.N.? T.N.?

998
01:19:08,751 --> 01:19:12,917
- T.N. What?
- I had to make sure you were here.

999
01:19:13,084 --> 01:19:17,126
Now that the mission's over. You take
without saying goodbye?

1000
01:19:17,292 --> 01:19:19,834
No, I'm not leaving. Of course you're not.

1001
01:19:20,001 --> 01:19:22,876
- All right, then. I have something for you.
- For me?

1002
01:19:23,042 --> 01:19:25,917
Yeah, for you. I found a tailor
downtown.

1003
01:19:26,084 --> 01:19:29,084
- You bought me a tailor?
- Idiot.

1004
01:19:30,959 --> 01:19:35,501
- Wow! A new body!
- Yeah, I ordered it yesterday.

1005
01:19:35,667 --> 01:19:39,292
- I didn't know that...
- Is that real cashmere?

1006
01:19:39,459 --> 01:19:43,084
It's thai silk. I don't have
I couldn't find another sword.

1007
01:19:43,251 --> 01:19:47,001
This is actually
not so bad.

1008
01:19:47,167 --> 01:19:52,001
- It's a pair of shiny buttons.
- The color might be more you.

1009
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:55,959
But of course...
a little too late now.

1010
01:19:59,876 --> 01:20:04,209
Oh, man.
Our mission is over, so...

1011
01:20:06,876 --> 01:20:13,167
But I was thinking that maybe
stick around for a while.

1012
01:20:13,334 --> 01:20:18,876
Or not here. Well, you know...
At home. Or if we...

1013
01:20:19,042 --> 01:20:23,251
Tell me, you're asking,
if we should move in together?

1014
01:20:23,417 --> 01:20:27,584
Of course you should stay,
you chequered fool.

1015
01:20:29,292 --> 01:20:33,542
Just in case.
You never know what might happen.

1016
01:20:33,709 --> 01:20:37,042
- No, that's just it.
- We ninjas gotta stick together.

1017
01:20:37,209 --> 01:20:41,501
- You said "we."
- Yes, I did.

1018
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:49,626
- What are you doing?
- Aren't you gonna try it?

1019
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:55,376
I've been given time off,
so we can go back to Denmark together.

1020
01:20:55,542 --> 01:20:58,501
A double gin & tonic, please.

1021
01:20:58,667 --> 01:21:00,917
What's going on?

1022
01:21:01,084 --> 01:21:04,292
- Cinderella has a stomach bug.
- I'll say.

1023
01:21:04,459 --> 01:21:07,917
Get ready with the app, Jørn.
Or what's your name?

1024
01:21:18,417 --> 01:21:21,584
- How is it?
- Just right. Now they can come on.

1025
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:23,834
Who?

1026
01:21:26,417 --> 01:21:28,501
Anybody.

1027
01:22:31,334 --> 01:22:37,126
This party's going to die.
Ash, hit that karaoke machine.

1028
01:22:37,292 --> 01:22:39,792
All right, here we go.

1029
01:22:39,959 --> 01:22:44,959
Papa-san? What's his name? Tanowat?
That's a nice girl you got there.

1030
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:49,584
Pretty girl.
Worth a lot of money in Denmark.

1031
01:22:49,751 --> 01:22:53,792
You're kidding. Now you get
some syrup here. Listen carefully.

1032
01:22:53,959 --> 01:22:58,126
I like to cook
When there are guests in my home

1033
01:22:58,292 --> 01:23:02,667
I'm no Gordon Ramsay
But a chop'steak is easy

1034
01:23:02,834 --> 01:23:07,167
You can spice it up with fried eggs
And a few pearl onions from the freezer

1035
01:23:07,334 --> 01:23:11,917
But whatever you try
# It's still just an ordinary meal

1036
01:23:12,084 --> 01:23:15,834
If the dish needs fixing
♪ It's got to have the right twist ♪

1037
01:23:16,001 --> 01:23:20,376
You gotta give it a little thai
That's the secret

1038
01:23:20,542 --> 01:23:25,251
Then you get chili and lemongrass
And monkey hearts in panang

1039
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:29,376
And insects deep-fried in batter

1040
01:23:29,542 --> 01:23:34,334
♪ Durian with galangal ♪
and dill in the pendant

1041
01:23:34,501 --> 01:23:38,334
Your taste buds will come to
to feast

1042
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:43,501
Just give it a little thai
You can use it in other situations.

1043
01:23:43,667 --> 01:23:48,001
The other day I was watching boxing
and it was on TV3

1044
01:23:48,167 --> 01:23:52,542
It was old men in swimming trunks
and they were tired, you could see

1045
01:23:52,709 --> 01:23:57,251
One of them packed a punch
the other one he was almost lame

1046
01:23:57,417 --> 01:24:01,709
the last 8 rounds
They were cheek dancing and hugging

1047
01:24:01,876 --> 01:24:05,626
A show like this has got to have a little go
And you didn't get it from me

1048
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:10,126
It needs a little thai
Are you getting there?

1049
01:24:10,292 --> 01:24:15,126
You'll get toothpaste for your bum
You'll get elbow bouillabaisse

1050
01:24:15,292 --> 01:24:19,334
And a silk ribbon
♪ If your forehead is adorned ♪

1051
01:24:19,501 --> 01:24:24,084
You'll get a knee in your jaw
You'll get a shinbone in your face

1052
01:24:24,251 --> 01:24:28,126
You get hand sandwiches with swing
And legs with feathers

1053
01:24:28,292 --> 01:24:30,626
Just give it a little thai

1054
01:24:30,792 --> 01:24:35,751
You wanna see some dance moves?
Let me come up here sometime.

1055
01:24:35,917 --> 01:24:39,209
Sorry, Jørn! It can be cleaned.

1056
01:24:39,376 --> 01:24:44,417
Uncle Stewart? It's a very
stereotypical view of Thailand.

1057
01:24:44,584 --> 01:24:47,209
Here's another verse.

1058
01:24:47,376 --> 01:24:51,417
I often get a sour hip
From hanging out at the cafe

1059
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:56,126
So I get a massage
At the Fald on Knee Alley

1060
01:24:56,292 --> 01:25:00,501
The therapist's name is Birtha
And she's a half-dry biscuit

1061
01:25:00,667 --> 01:25:05,084
There's not much fucking ramasjang
# Lying on Birtha's slab

1062
01:25:05,251 --> 01:25:09,084
But it can be fixed with a trick
And I'll give you a hint

1063
01:25:09,251 --> 01:25:13,542
It's got to be Thai
And it can't get too little of it.

1064
01:25:13,709 --> 01:25:18,542
You'll be kneaded below the belt
♪ By a girl who can take it ♪

1065
01:25:18,709 --> 01:25:22,834
♪ Every tension and myosis ♪
Loosens

1066
01:25:23,001 --> 01:25:27,501
And a happy ending it will be
Only for 800 baht

1067
01:25:27,667 --> 01:25:32,126
So if you just
right on and hard will ask me

1068
01:25:32,292 --> 01:25:36,667
I'll have to answer you, kid
There's only one way

1069
01:25:36,834 --> 01:25:40,001
and you get on chalk
If you don't have a journey

1070
01:25:40,167 --> 01:25:45,001
All in all
Go give it some Thai

1071
01:25:45,167 --> 01:25:47,834
Yessirenas!

1072
01:25:49,126 --> 01:25:54,459
It's good. Let go of me. Go away
with you, bitch. You're gonna get a bloody nose.

1073
01:25:54,626 --> 01:25:59,209
I'm not wearing a garland.
I have pollen allergies!

1074
01:25:59,376 --> 01:26:00,251
