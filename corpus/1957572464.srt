1
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:10,484
(file drawer clicks)

2
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:15,913
(drawer bangs shut)

3
00:00:17,694 --> 00:00:21,160
- All right Ms. Robertson,
let's start at the beginning,

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,077
when you first met Ray.

5
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:32,398
- Ray was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

6
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:37,096
Can't say that about many people.

7
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:39,763
(gentle music)

8
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:49,288
He was quiet guy, quiet and angry, but,

9
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,107
there was that strange
kindness to him as well.

10
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:01,000
(gunshots blast)

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,685
That fierceness that
he just couldn't hide.

12
00:01:02,685 --> 00:01:05,435
(gunshots blast)

13
00:01:06,514 --> 00:01:11,514
(gentle somber music)
(wind whipping)

14
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,070
Terrible loneliness too.

15
00:01:20,598 --> 00:01:24,098
(gentle sorrowful music)

16
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:29,460
He was haunted by the memory
and ghost of his dead wife.

17
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,460
Hit and run.

18
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:34,984
(gentle somber music)

19
00:01:34,984 --> 00:01:36,734
Never got the driver.

20
00:01:38,344 --> 00:01:41,511
(gentle music swells)

21
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:48,387
(horns honk distantly)

22
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:51,054
(John laughing)

23
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:53,461
(John sighs)

24
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:56,678
(elevator dings)

25
00:01:56,678 --> 00:01:58,466
- Ah, there it is.

26
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:01,033
We're gonna have some fun.

27
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:03,366
(both moan)

28
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:08,034
I can hardly wait, Johnny.

29
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:08,951
- Oh, yeah.

30
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:19,686
Oh my gosh. I think I drank
a little too much. (laughs)

31
00:02:22,436 --> 00:02:23,900
(Johnny sighs)

32
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,533
(bad thuds)

33
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:28,366
(Johnny groaning)

34
00:02:33,923 --> 00:02:37,259
- Knock, knock. (laughs)

35
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,106
John, John, John, it's
your old pal, Gregor.

36
00:02:41,106 --> 00:02:44,051
You haven't forgotten about
your old friends, have you?

37
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:47,746
Listen John, you have
something that belongs to me,

38
00:02:47,746 --> 00:02:50,740
that which you took, and I want it back.

39
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,899
I'm gonna give you 72 hours, buddy.

40
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:56,566
72 hours to return what is mine.

41
00:02:58,363 --> 00:03:01,299
As for the amount, I'm
sure you can recall,

42
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:03,466
as you were my accountant.

43
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:08,976
Where were we?

44
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,306
(jaw pops)

45
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:14,389
- How's that?

46
00:03:19,138 --> 00:03:21,040
- He's late. Figures, doesn't it?

47
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,338
- Thought this was gonna go quickly.

48
00:03:22,338 --> 00:03:24,357
I've got a plane to catch.

49
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:26,330
- I still don't see why he has to be here,

50
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,141
or what right he has to be here.

51
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:28,974
My father--

52
00:03:28,974 --> 00:03:33,034
- Your father, Fariba, was quite clear.

53
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:35,859
He wanted Ray to be at the reading.

54
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:38,481
I have the codicil to his
last request right here.

55
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:39,940
- He's not even a member of this family.

56
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,735
He was just married to our
poor sister, that's it.

57
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:45,179
- Hm, foolish marriage, poor Roya.

58
00:03:45,179 --> 00:03:47,950
Our sister was kind but not wise.

59
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,173
- Fariba, please, let's deal
with this the best we can.

60
00:03:52,173 --> 00:03:53,480
Your father adored Ray.

61
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,782
So let's just wait and
be a little patient.

62
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:57,012
- Well, that's easy for you to say.

63
00:03:57,012 --> 00:03:59,404
I got a meeting this afternoon in Austin.

64
00:03:59,404 --> 00:04:02,184
- I don't understand my parents at all.

65
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:06,014
Ray, his family. He was my aunt's husband.

66
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:07,555
What is wrong with you?

67
00:04:07,555 --> 00:04:10,176
- Lower your voice, Yasi,
and mind your manners.

68
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:12,076
- Why do you hate him so much?

69
00:04:12,076 --> 00:04:13,824
- We don't hate him.

70
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:17,970
He's just not our kind
of people. He never was.

71
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,846
Right, Hooshang?

72
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:21,763
(knocking at door)

73
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:25,948
- Ah, Ray. Come in, have a seat.

74
00:04:30,742 --> 00:04:32,049
- Sorry I'm late.

75
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:33,490
- Finally.

76
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,291
- We'll note for the
record that all the persons

77
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,608
in the immediate Kazemi
family are present.

78
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:39,336
- Can we cut to the chase and just read

79
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:41,919
what my father has left to him?

80
00:04:45,337 --> 00:04:47,754
- I suppose that can be done.

81
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:54,001
I, Korush Kazemi, being of sound mind,

82
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:56,804
do hereby leave to Rahmin Ardalan,

83
00:04:56,804 --> 00:04:59,637
my property on 147 Western Avenue.

84
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:04,146
- What property is that, which one?

85
00:05:04,146 --> 00:05:07,167
- Is that the 12-unit apartment building?

86
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:08,044
- What?

87
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:10,226
- No, no, it's the small shopping center.

88
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,902
- No, no, he can't have it.

89
00:05:11,902 --> 00:05:14,319
- Fariba, your father Korush,

90
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:19,229
gave me this attendant letter
for you and for your brother,

91
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:23,896
and I think now is an excellent
time for you to hear it.

92
00:05:26,963 --> 00:05:30,546
"My dear children, do
not be angry with me.

93
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:37,212
I wanted to give something to
Ray for his immense kindness

94
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,290
that he showed to both
myself and to my daughter

95
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,606
and your dear sister, Roya.

96
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:43,106
Ray is a good man.

97
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:46,419
And I'm sure in time you will understand

98
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:48,716
the nature of my desire in this matter.

99
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,939
Your loving father."

100
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:54,233
- Great, so this stranger
to the family, this person,

101
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:56,169
just walks out with the asset
that could have belonged

102
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:57,802
to my daughter?

103
00:05:57,802 --> 00:06:00,029
Hooshang, say something.

104
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:02,640
- Say what? This is your father's wish.

105
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,230
- He was obviously delusional
when he made that decision.

106
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,285
This is an outrage, with all
the medication he was on.

107
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:09,794
- Yeah, and all the time
he spent with Bubba,

108
00:06:09,794 --> 00:06:12,329
he probably convinced him
to put him in his will.

109
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,037
I will contest this in court.

110
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:15,246
- Uh, where are you going?

111
00:06:15,246 --> 00:06:19,630
- [Fariba] Let him go.
We'll see you in court.

112
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,797
- No need. Maybe you're
right, I don't deserve it.

113
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:30,194
I'll sign whatever you want.

114
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,863
- Shame on you.

115
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:36,946
- Yasi, Yasi.

116
00:06:38,404 --> 00:06:39,237
Oh great.

117
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:42,841
- Ray, wait. Please.

118
00:06:47,851 --> 00:06:51,044
Don't mind my parents. You know them.

119
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:54,711
My mom, she doesn't
know when to stay still.

120
00:06:56,908 --> 00:07:00,075
I'll never forget what you did for me.

121
00:07:01,144 --> 00:07:05,824
And you deserve whatever my
grandfather wants you to have.

122
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:10,157
You visited him every day
in the hospital. Only you.

123
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:15,532
That property is yours.

124
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:16,949
Don't give it up.

125
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,590
Promise me you'll think about it.

126
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:23,951
Promise.

127
00:07:23,951 --> 00:07:26,951
(slow somber music)

128
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,097
- Doctor says you have a concussion

129
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:52,794
and there's bleeding on your brain.

130
00:07:52,794 --> 00:07:54,786
- Ooh, sounds ominous.

131
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:57,947
- Can you please tell me what happened?

132
00:07:57,947 --> 00:07:59,114
- I fell down.

133
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:03,107
- [Mona] That's it?

134
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:06,674
- Yep. (sighs)

135
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:11,674
- So you were drunk, again.
And there was probably a woman.

136
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,460
- Oh, please, don't go there.

137
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,127
- I don't wanna go there, John.

138
00:08:18,052 --> 00:08:20,337
It's been a year. We're separated.

139
00:08:20,337 --> 00:08:22,573
The divorce papers are almost finalized,

140
00:08:22,573 --> 00:08:25,594
and now I have to come find you like this?

141
00:08:25,594 --> 00:08:27,094
I can't trust you.

142
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:29,982
- What do you want?

143
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:31,565
- I want it to end.

144
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:34,105
I never wanted to leave the states, John.

145
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:39,105
I followed you. I did
whatever you wanted. I did it.

146
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,271
It's always about business with you.

147
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,271
- I was a good provider.

148
00:08:45,163 --> 00:08:47,425
I did everything for you and Vicki.

149
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:52,260
- John, what you did is a
normal part of being a father.

150
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,093
You never cared about my feelings.

151
00:08:56,298 --> 00:08:58,564
And not about your daughter, either.

152
00:08:58,564 --> 00:09:00,457
Which is the reason why she's
not even talking to you.

153
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:05,333
- (groans) I just don't
need this right now, Mona.

154
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,500
- Know what? Neither do I.

155
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:14,332
- (sighs) Mona. Mona.

- Hi, Vicki. How are you?

170
00:09:36,988 --> 00:09:39,061
- Great. Having the time of my life.

171
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:40,068
How are you?

172
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:42,671
- I'm good. Um, is your aunt around?

173
00:09:42,671 --> 00:09:45,891
- No, she left on her cruise this morning,

174
00:09:45,891 --> 00:09:48,579
Remember, she left the
house to my safekeeping?

175
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:50,330
That was the plan, right?

176
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,685
- What's going on over there?

177
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:54,935
- Relax. Just a few friends having fun.

178
00:09:57,705 --> 00:09:59,577
Are you checking up on
me like you always do?

179
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:02,117
- No, I'm not, honey.

180
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:04,101
Listen, I want to talk
to you about your father.

181
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:06,716
- No, Mom. I don't want
to talk about Dad, okay.

182
00:10:06,716 --> 00:10:08,888
You promised. Coming to
L.A. was my decision, okay?

183
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:10,790
I'm a big girl, I can handle this.

184
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,970
- I know, but--

185
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,952
- No, there's no buts.

186
00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:16,477
It's only for a few days,
don't ruin it for me.

187
00:10:16,477 --> 00:10:17,860
- Okay.

188
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,981
When's the big meeting with the agency?

189
00:10:20,981 --> 00:10:21,898
- Few days.

190
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:23,833
Please pray for me.

191
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:27,005
They say it's between me and another girl.

192
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:28,391
You don't even know
how big this is for me.

193
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:31,991
I mean, imagine your, your
daughter's face on billboards.

194
00:10:31,991 --> 00:10:35,609
I'm talking about L.A.
magazines, entertainment.

195
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:36,526
Hello? Mom?

196
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,504
(eerie music)

197
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:02,837
- Hey, hey, I want a shoot
with you. Can we shoot?

198
00:11:02,837 --> 00:11:04,138
- I don't know, Freddy.

199
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:06,502
- Oh, come on, this town,
it's, it's all about

200
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:10,756
your connections and your
relationships, and who you know.

201
00:11:10,756 --> 00:11:15,756
So, look, what if your big
meeting doesn't go so well,

202
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:18,254
or according to plan?

203
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:20,098
What are you gonna do?

204
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:24,537
- I know what you mean.
Let me think about it.

205
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:26,380
- Let me help you.

206
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,047
I am the best, the best
shooter in the city.

207
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,010
(camera shutter clicks)

208
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,593
Among other things.

209
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:39,051
Think about it.

210
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:40,301
- He's hot too.

211
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,965
- [John] Hey.

212
00:11:49,965 --> 00:11:51,821
- What is this?

213
00:11:51,821 --> 00:11:52,829
What's going on, John?

214
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:55,434
Can you please for once
just tell me the truth?

215
00:11:55,434 --> 00:11:57,896
- Just calm down, calm down.

216
00:11:57,896 --> 00:11:59,606
What's, what's wrong with you?

217
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:04,523
- What's wrong with me? What
kind of sick person does this?

218
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:13,170
- How'd you get these?

219
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,587
- [Mona] They were on my car.

220
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:19,040
- When did she go to Los Angeles?

221
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,144
- Doesn't matter when she went,
she's there right now, John.

222
00:12:22,144 --> 00:12:23,557
- Well, isn't anybody gonna tell me?

223
00:12:23,557 --> 00:12:25,843
- She doesn't talk to
you anymore, remember?

224
00:12:25,843 --> 00:12:26,802
- God.

225
00:12:26,802 --> 00:12:27,776
- Does this have something to do

226
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:29,213
with you being in the hospital?

227
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:30,713
Some bad business?

228
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:35,162
- Look, Mona, I'll, I'll take care of it.

229
00:12:35,162 --> 00:12:36,398
- How are you gonna take care of it?

230
00:12:36,398 --> 00:12:38,047
You know what? Maybe I
should call the police.

231
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:39,062
- No.

232
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:40,055
No cops.

233
00:12:40,055 --> 00:12:40,888
- Why not?

234
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,638
- They're (sighs),

235
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,777
they're, they're just pictures.

236
00:12:46,777 --> 00:12:48,102
- They are not just pictures.

237
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:50,174
Why would somebody take
pictures of Vicki in L.A.

238
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:51,839
and put them on my car, John?

239
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,199
It looks like they wanted you to see this.

240
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:56,949
- Uh, look, just don't worry her,

241
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:01,813
but get her home as soon as you can.

242
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:05,316
- So this is serious.

243
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:07,292
John, I demand you tell me
what's going on right now

244
00:13:07,292 --> 00:13:09,875
because I'm not gonna let you
put my daughter in danger.

245
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,194
- Look, she's my daughter too,

246
00:13:12,194 --> 00:13:13,996
and I care about her just as much as you--

247
00:13:13,996 --> 00:13:15,277
(machine beeps rapidly)

248
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:16,110
- John?

249
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,077
John?

250
00:13:17,077 --> 00:13:18,969
John.
- Excuse us, ma'am.

251
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:20,884
Call Dr. Mordecai.

252
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:21,967
Ma'am.
- John.

253
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:39,281
- You didn't have to come, boss.

254
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:43,749
I could've taken care of it,
but I'm glad you're here.

255
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:44,957
- Is he okay?

256
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,537
- Rudy? Yeah, he's fine. Just
a little crack to the head.

257
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:51,641
Chased off all the bad
guys. It's all good.

258
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:54,079
- How's the wife doing?

259
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,696
- Giving birth in a week.

260
00:13:56,696 --> 00:13:58,049
- Nervous?

261
00:13:58,049 --> 00:13:58,882
- No. Why?

262
00:14:05,965 --> 00:14:08,687
- (sighs) Sorry I didn't nail him, boss.

263
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:11,604
Scared him off, nothing was stolen.

264
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:15,066
- That's all right. That's our job.

265
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,709
We're human guard dogs.

266
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:19,792
That's why we get paid the big bucks.

267
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:24,795
- Turn around, let me see that.

268
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:28,437
- Oh, it's no big deal. It's nothing.

269
00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:29,929
- [Ray] You did good, kid.

270
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:30,762
- Thanks.

271
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:33,197
- Time to go home.

272
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:36,614
- Right. I'll take care of the paperwork.

273
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:44,328
(tense suspenseful music)

274
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:12,723
- Hey.

275
00:15:16,368 --> 00:15:17,201
Hey.

276
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:20,249
Thanks for coming, boss.

277
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:21,332
- No problem.

278
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:23,889
- You hungry?

279
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,666
- Uh, no, thanks.

280
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:26,666
- Thank you.

281
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,343
- And?

282
00:15:31,707 --> 00:15:35,478
- There's nothing. I told
you this would take time.

283
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:39,095
Ray, there were thousands
of black SUV's in L.A.

284
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:41,990
with all the background
checks, arrest records.

285
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,420
Aside from the description of the car,

286
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,656
we don't even have a
witness to ID a driver.

287
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,264
- It's been a year, Shawn.

288
00:15:50,264 --> 00:15:53,256
- I know, but sometimes a
confession might come forth

289
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:57,426
from prison, or a witnesses start to talk,

290
00:15:57,426 --> 00:15:58,832
when they feel like talking.

291
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,108
- So what is this about?

292
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:01,941
- Okay.

293
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,517
Here's the story.

294
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,622
I got this call from a
worried Persian mother.

295
00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:11,943
Her daughter is half
Persian, half American.

296
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:14,299
She's in L.A. for a few more days.

297
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:16,420
We need someone to keep an eye on her,

298
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,920
I thought about your company, what you do.

299
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:23,775
- Why?

300
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:28,456
- You're in the security
business. It's a job, a gig.

301
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:31,043
Just, the mom wants her
kid to be watched on,

302
00:16:31,043 --> 00:16:32,378
and it pays well.

303
00:16:32,378 --> 00:16:35,893
- Yeah, but why does she need protection?

304
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:38,428
- The parents are separated.

305
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:43,206
From what I gather, the
father was in bad business.

306
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:45,741
Lots of unanswered questions.

307
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:47,724
He's in a hospital with
some kind of head injury.

308
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:52,472
Bottom line, the daughter's
being stalked because of this.

309
00:16:52,472 --> 00:16:55,688
And we have a worried mother.

310
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:58,271
She's an old friend of my wife.

311
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:03,470
So you'll do it?

312
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:07,350
- But Shawn, I do corporate
securities, concerts, clubs,

313
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,436
stuff like that.

314
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:10,970
- So this is more personal.

315
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,832
Just put one of your guys
on her from distance,

316
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,082
and that's all.

317
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:22,017
(Ray sighs)

318
00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:23,902
One more thing.

319
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:27,596
The mom doesn't want her to
know she's being watched.

320
00:17:27,596 --> 00:17:29,679
So, here are the details.

321
00:17:30,703 --> 00:17:32,908
I get this call in the
middle of the night.

322
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:36,134
She's an old friend of my wife.

323
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:36,967
- Goodbye.

324
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:44,879
(deep somber music)

325
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:28,670
- John, John, John. (laughs)

326
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,019
It's Gregor. (speaks foreign language)

327
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:34,678
You got two days, man.

328
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:37,428
Two days to deliver my groceries.

329
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:41,298
I tell you, man, this...

330
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:44,119
Ah.

331
00:18:46,862 --> 00:18:49,695
You look beautiful, my little one.

332
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:54,732
So beautiful.

333
00:18:58,827 --> 00:19:01,660
Welcome. (laughs)

334
00:19:05,751 --> 00:19:08,890
(Mishka winces)

335
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,173
- (gasps) Please. Please, don't hurt me.

336
00:19:12,173 --> 00:19:14,498
- Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh.

337
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:16,415
I wouldn't dream of it.

338
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:19,798
I,

339
00:19:23,565 --> 00:19:26,926
I'm a creature of love, my sweet.

340
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:28,023
(Mishka gasps)

341
00:19:28,023 --> 00:19:30,690
(Mishka groans)

342
00:19:32,846 --> 00:19:33,679
- Oh god.

343
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:40,706
(Mishka groans)
(table bangs rhythmically)

344
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,449
(Mishka crying)

345
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:51,823
(Gregor groans)

346
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:57,185
(Gregor panting)

347
00:20:00,964 --> 00:20:02,343
(Mishka shudders)

348
00:20:02,343 --> 00:20:04,593
- [Gregor] Now you're mine.

349
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,291
I will be protecting you, always.

350
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:13,494
- [TV Reporter] Today,
two murders and a robbery

351
00:20:13,494 --> 00:20:15,476
in less than 24 hours.

352
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:18,505
And the city citizens are
on edge after a gun battle

353
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:20,950
erupts on their city streets.

354
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,407
One police officer is killed
and four others hospitalized--

355
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:26,266
- Mm, looks good.

356
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,099
- Mm-hmm.

357
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:29,511
- [TV Reporter] The
afternoon carnage ended

358
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:32,052
when one of the suspects,
later identified as--

359
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:33,541
- Oh!

360
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,418
Oh.

361
00:20:34,418 --> 00:20:35,952
- You okay?
- Mm.

362
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:36,785
- You okay?

363
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:37,728
- I think it's time.

364
00:20:37,728 --> 00:20:38,799
- Breathe, breathe.

365
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:39,632
- Get the bags.
- Just breathe, baby.

366
00:20:39,632 --> 00:20:40,710
Baby, just breathe.

367
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,543
- Honey, get the bags.

368
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:46,521
(phone vibrates)

369
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:50,693
- Hey, Jack.

370
00:20:50,693 --> 00:20:53,236
- Boss, look, I'm in a tight spot here.

371
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:54,837
I'd like to leave the house
to watch this girl for you,

372
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,177
but I can't leave Ana,
the baby's premature.

373
00:20:57,177 --> 00:20:58,055
I'm kinda stuck.

374
00:20:58,055 --> 00:21:00,248
- Look, don't sweat it.

375
00:21:00,248 --> 00:21:02,752
- I'm sorry, boss. I can watch
her tomorrow if you'd like.

376
00:21:02,752 --> 00:21:03,854
You know, after the birth and all.

377
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:07,440
- Jack, stay with your wife.
I'll figure something else.

378
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,196
- Look, I'm sorry.

379
00:21:09,196 --> 00:21:12,891
- Go take care of your wife,
and stop talking to me.

380
00:21:12,891 --> 00:21:16,407
(phone key beeps)

381
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:17,824
- Okay, let's go.

382
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:22,413
(slow somber music)

383
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:55,842

384
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:39,482

412
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:07,509
(slow somber music)

413
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:21,173
- [Vicki] Thanks.

414
00:25:21,173 --> 00:25:22,094
- Awesome.

415
00:25:22,094 --> 00:25:24,164
- [Vicki] Felt good.

416
00:25:24,164 --> 00:25:25,581

417
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:36,544

00:25:36,544 --> 00:25:41,274
Vicki (laughs), you're beautiful.

419
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:42,313
- Thanks.

420
00:25:42,313 --> 00:25:46,400
- That was incredible.
You're a natural, you are.

421
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,800
I wanna help you. I, I can help you.

422
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,532
I know everybody at, at the agencies.

423
00:25:51,532 --> 00:25:54,725
I know people at, at CAA at ICM.

424
00:25:54,725 --> 00:25:57,506
You have one of those faces, you know?

425
00:25:57,506 --> 00:25:58,339
- Freddy.

426
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:01,301
(deep tense music)

427
00:26:01,301 --> 00:26:02,593
- Can I be there?

428
00:26:02,593 --> 00:26:03,426
- Yeah.

429
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:05,792
- Listen.

430
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,296
- Freddy.

431
00:26:08,296 --> 00:26:09,473
- Come on, I'm--

432
00:26:09,473 --> 00:26:10,562
- No.

433
00:26:10,562 --> 00:26:11,395
- I just, I just want--

434
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:12,563
- Freddy, get off me.

435
00:26:12,563 --> 00:26:15,338
- Come on, it's me.
- Stop. Get off me.

436
00:26:15,338 --> 00:26:16,834
- Hey. Come on.

437
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:18,501
- Don't. Get off me.

438
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:20,763
- What?

439
00:26:20,763 --> 00:26:23,838
(Freddy yelling)

440
00:26:23,838 --> 00:26:24,671
(head thuds)

441
00:26:24,671 --> 00:26:27,745
(Freddy yelling in pain)

442
00:26:27,745 --> 00:26:29,328
You son of--

443
00:26:29,328 --> 00:26:31,995
(Freddy crying)

444
00:26:34,915 --> 00:26:38,693
- When a girl says no, she means no.

445
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:39,693
- I'm sorry.

446
00:26:40,941 --> 00:26:42,534
I'm sorry.

447
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,867
Vicki, I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

448
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:58,696
(gentle somber music)

449
00:27:13,888 --> 00:27:17,138
(horns honk distantly)

450
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:29,127
- Hey.

451
00:27:29,127 --> 00:27:32,353
- Hey, sorry. Got here as fast as I could.

452
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:34,482
The traffic on the 110 was f'd up.

453
00:27:34,482 --> 00:27:36,312
- Thanks for coming.

454
00:27:36,312 --> 00:27:37,350
- You okay?

455
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,121
- Yeah, I'm fine.

456
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:40,690
Just take me home, please.

457
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,901
- I'm seriously gonna kill Freddy.

458
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:44,380
Every single time he does that
coke, his dick takes over.

459
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,920
It's stupid.
- Can we just go, Jenny?

460
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,753
Please.

461
00:27:46,753 --> 00:27:48,584
- Sure, hun.

462
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,417
- Thanks.

463
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:59,016
(dog barks distantly)

464
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,526
(cellphone rings)

465
00:28:22,057 --> 00:28:23,471
Hi, Mom.

466
00:28:23,471 --> 00:28:25,936
- Hi, honey. How are you?

467
00:28:25,936 --> 00:28:27,146
How was the shoot today?

468
00:28:27,146 --> 00:28:29,244
- It went great, really great.

469
00:28:29,244 --> 00:28:32,166
I think I got some really
hot shots for my book.

470
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,060
- I can hardly wait to see them.

471
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,700
- Once I get the file,
I'll email you some shots.

472
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,356
So, you sure everything
is okay in old Canada?

473
00:28:41,356 --> 00:28:43,663
- Yeah, everything's okay.

474
00:28:43,663 --> 00:28:46,801
Um, I just like to hear your voice

475
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:48,587
and know that you're happy.

476
00:28:48,587 --> 00:28:52,193
- I'm happy. I'm really
happy, everything's great.

477
00:28:52,193 --> 00:28:55,392
- Okay, well uh, I gotta go now.

478
00:28:55,392 --> 00:28:56,779
I'll talk to you soon, okay?

479
00:28:56,779 --> 00:28:57,822
I love you buku.

480
00:28:57,822 --> 00:28:59,655
- Love you buku back.

481
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,044
- Why did you lie to her? Freddy
was a super bastard to you.

482
00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:11,654
- That exact reason, Jenny.

483
00:29:11,654 --> 00:29:12,711
I don't want her to worry, okay.

484
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:15,499
She's, she's already worried
enough with me down here.

485
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:19,886
- And how did you survive
puberty, let alone dating?

486
00:29:19,886 --> 00:29:21,219
- Wasn't pretty.

487
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:28,252
(phones ring distantly)

488
00:29:28,252 --> 00:29:29,085
(knocking at door)

489
00:29:29,085 --> 00:29:29,918
- [Tom] Mrs. Robertson?

490
00:29:29,918 --> 00:29:30,751
- Yes?

491
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:33,652
- I'm Tom Mordecai.

492
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:37,131
I'm the neurologist on
your husband's case.

493
00:29:37,131 --> 00:29:39,196
- How serious is it, doctor?

494
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:41,946
- Uh, would you like to sit down?

495
00:29:43,432 --> 00:29:45,887
I wish I had better news.

496
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:48,846
Currently, your husband is in a coma.

497
00:29:48,846 --> 00:29:53,846
Um, uh, the coma has been
caused by massive bleeding

498
00:29:53,996 --> 00:29:55,079
in his brain.

499
00:29:56,746 --> 00:29:59,215
For the time being, we'll keep him under

500
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:03,080
a medically-induced coma
and explore various options

501
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,330
for keeping the bleeding under control.

502
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:10,096
We're doing our very best.

503
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:13,342
We'll keep you updated.

504
00:30:13,342 --> 00:30:15,145
- Thank you, doctor.

505
00:30:15,145 --> 00:30:18,145
(slow somber music)

506
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:24,125
(insects chirping)

507
00:30:25,352 --> 00:30:28,617
- No movement. Got herself
tucked away inside.

508
00:30:28,617 --> 00:30:32,367
- Good. Let me know if
things change. Thanks.

509
00:30:36,738 --> 00:30:38,905
- Sorry for the wait, Ray.

510
00:30:39,986 --> 00:30:41,736
It's good to see you.

511
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:46,124
Please, have a seat.

512
00:30:46,124 --> 00:30:48,041
I asked for you to come

513
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:53,807
because I, I wanted to talk to
you about the property issue.

514
00:30:53,807 --> 00:30:55,474
- There is no issue.

515
00:30:56,669 --> 00:30:59,907
- Good, I'm glad to hear that

516
00:30:59,907 --> 00:31:03,196
because there has been somebody
interested in that property

517
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:05,238
for a very long time.

518
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:09,794
And of course, if you agree,
we'll get you a finder's fee

519
00:31:09,794 --> 00:31:14,076
or maybe do some profit
sharing, we'll find something.

520
00:31:14,076 --> 00:31:14,909
- Sure.

521
00:31:16,063 --> 00:31:17,730
- Ray, are you okay?

522
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,382
How have you been?

523
00:31:21,382 --> 00:31:24,081
Are you taking your medication?

524
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:26,443
- Just let me know when you need me.

525
00:31:26,443 --> 00:31:29,360
- Oh, Ray. You have cardiomyopathy.

526
00:31:33,245 --> 00:31:38,245
You have heart failure, in
conjunction with coronary issues.

527
00:31:39,224 --> 00:31:41,746
Are you trying to kill yourself?

528
00:31:41,746 --> 00:31:42,579
(Hooshang sighs)

529
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:45,577
I'm keeping you on the
digoxin and the nitro.

530
00:31:45,577 --> 00:31:48,003
It will help manage your pain.

531
00:31:48,003 --> 00:31:49,836
But if you don't ta...

532
00:31:54,068 --> 00:31:55,054
(Hooshang sighs)

533
00:31:55,054 --> 00:31:58,137
(relaxed jazz music)

534
00:32:00,015 --> 00:32:01,015
- Yes, Rudy.

535
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:06,689
Yes, I know the place. I'm on my way.

536
00:32:06,689 --> 00:32:09,772
(relaxed jazz music)

537
00:32:26,983 --> 00:32:27,816
Hey.

538
00:32:27,816 --> 00:32:28,823
- Hey.

539
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:31,585
- I'll take it from here, Rudy. Thanks.

540
00:32:31,585 --> 00:32:34,585
- All right, boss. I'll be in touch.

541
00:32:45,223 --> 00:32:48,723
(tense suspenseful music)

542
00:33:02,263 --> 00:33:04,763
(Yasi laughs)

543
00:33:06,889 --> 00:33:08,295
- Hi, kiddo.

544
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:10,800
- What a nice surprise to see you here.

545
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,717
- You too.

546
00:33:13,202 --> 00:33:18,202
- (laughs) That's my Uncle
Ray. A man of few words.

547
00:33:20,518 --> 00:33:25,435
I, I'm almost ready to tell my
parents about what happened.

548
00:33:26,413 --> 00:33:29,080
I'm just building up my courage.

549
00:33:31,054 --> 00:33:32,318
- I respect that.

550
00:33:32,318 --> 00:33:33,341
- So I told him straight up,

551
00:33:33,341 --> 00:33:34,671
I am not gonna let you put it there.

552
00:33:34,671 --> 00:33:37,085
Some things I just won't do.

553
00:33:37,085 --> 00:33:38,471
L.A. guys are just so different.

554
00:33:38,471 --> 00:33:41,638
I just want a guy with cash and a car.

555
00:33:44,862 --> 00:33:47,919
Did I tell you that Steve
has a major crush on me?

556
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,002
- I think that's him. That's the guy.

557
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:53,680
- Really? Who is he?

558
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,941
- From this morning.

559
00:33:54,941 --> 00:33:56,228
- Well go talk to him.

560
00:33:56,228 --> 00:33:57,185
- What?

561
00:33:57,185 --> 00:34:00,075
- Well, at least you
should thank him, right?

562
00:34:00,075 --> 00:34:01,589
- Yeah.

563
00:34:01,589 --> 00:34:03,018
Yeah.

564
00:34:03,018 --> 00:34:05,524
- Oh god, I am major late.

565
00:34:05,524 --> 00:34:07,071
Mom's gonna have a heart attack,

566
00:34:07,071 --> 00:34:09,238
big family dinner tonight.

567
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:13,896
Remember, don't take
my folks too seriously.

568
00:34:13,896 --> 00:34:15,275
- Never have.

569
00:34:15,275 --> 00:34:17,942
(Yasi chuckles)

570
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:22,624
- Hey.

571
00:34:24,305 --> 00:34:25,727
You're the one, right?

572
00:34:25,727 --> 00:34:27,549
- [Ray] Excuse me.

573
00:34:27,549 --> 00:34:29,718
- I never forget faces.

574
00:34:29,718 --> 00:34:32,171
I just wanna say thank you.

575
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:34,796
Can I at least buy you a
cup of coffee or something?

576
00:34:34,796 --> 00:34:35,643
- Thanks, but--

577
00:34:35,643 --> 00:34:37,976
- Please. I'm just grateful.

578
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:41,954
(gentle music)

579
00:34:54,269 --> 00:34:56,655
This is my friend, Jenny.
She was just leaving.

580
00:34:56,655 --> 00:34:57,488
- What?

581
00:34:58,982 --> 00:35:01,972
Oh yeah. I'm so late, but I'm
gonna call you later, okay?

582
00:35:01,972 --> 00:35:02,805
- Cool.

583
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:11,483
He was very quiet. I did
most of the talking, really.

584
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,567
Told him about my modeling career

585
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:17,342
and my shitty ex-boyfriend.

586
00:35:17,342 --> 00:35:20,592
Little things. He mainly just listened.

587
00:35:24,092 --> 00:35:28,425
- So at this point, he never
told you about himself?

588
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:32,093
How he just happened to
be in the coffee shop

589
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:34,187
the same day he rescued you?

590
00:35:34,187 --> 00:35:36,561
- No mention of Gregor Sarkoff?

591
00:35:36,561 --> 00:35:38,162
- No.

592
00:35:38,162 --> 00:35:39,662
My dad? Forget it.

593
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:43,477
Zero relationship.

594
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:45,411
When he dragged us out of LA to Canada,

595
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:47,911
everything just went downhill.

596
00:35:49,085 --> 00:35:51,807
He doesn't approve what I do here.

597
00:35:51,807 --> 00:35:52,724
- Modeling?

598
00:35:53,644 --> 00:35:54,979
- Right.

599
00:35:54,979 --> 00:35:56,448
Spent a fortune on piano lessons.

600
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:59,943
He wanted me to be a concert prodigy, but.

601
00:35:59,943 --> 00:36:01,224
- Were you good?

602
00:36:01,224 --> 00:36:05,272
- Oh, I'm good at
everything I do. (chuckles)

603
00:36:05,272 --> 00:36:08,291
No, I play well, okay, but
I didn't have the passion.

604
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,357
It didn't drive me. I
just played by numbers.

605
00:36:11,357 --> 00:36:14,854
- If you love what you do,
you're going to be great.

606
00:36:14,854 --> 00:36:16,826
Modeling, I mean.

607
00:36:16,826 --> 00:36:17,826
- Thank you.

608
00:36:19,129 --> 00:36:19,962
Thank you.

609
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:25,469
So how 'bout you, mister
tall, dark and mysterious?

610
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,668
How did you happen to be here today

611
00:36:28,668 --> 00:36:31,945
to save me from that creep, Freddy?

612
00:36:31,945 --> 00:36:33,862
- Just timing, I guess.

613
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:39,965
- Lucky for me, I thought at the time.

614
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:42,178
And that was it.

615
00:36:50,393 --> 00:36:52,220
He was a perfect gentleman.

616
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,053
(keys clatter)

617
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:56,053
He even walked me to the front door.

618
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,900
- Well, goodnight, Vicki.

619
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,043
- Night, Ray.

620
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:07,708
Thanks for the ride.

621
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:11,588
(cricket chirps)

622
00:37:25,754 --> 00:37:29,004
(car door clicks open)

623
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:33,504
(car door bangs shut)

624
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:36,837
(car engine turns over)

625
00:37:42,416 --> 00:37:45,499
(gentle piano music)

626
00:37:59,491 --> 00:38:02,658
(pool balls clacking)

627
00:38:03,712 --> 00:38:08,129
(piano music increases in intensity)

628
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:25,665
(machine beeps)
(machine hisses)

629
00:38:27,646 --> 00:38:30,729
(gentle piano music)

630
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:52,191
(deep pulsating music)

631
00:38:54,774 --> 00:38:57,941
And that was the first time I met Ray.

632
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,854
Little did I know what the
days would bring ahead or,

633
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:05,604
what my mother was going through.

634
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:15,818
(people chattering)
(phone rings distantly)

635
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:20,823
- I understand your
concern, Mrs. Robertson.

636
00:39:20,823 --> 00:39:22,992
Listen, I have my man here,

637
00:39:22,992 --> 00:39:25,491
who's on your daughter's
security situation.

638
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:27,947
Mrs. Robertson, please meet Ray Ardalan,

639
00:39:27,947 --> 00:39:30,535
owner of Ardalan Security Incorporated.

640
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,061
- Hello, Mr. Ardalan.

641
00:39:32,061 --> 00:39:33,731
- Mrs. Robertson, let me assure you,

642
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:36,463
we've been watching your daughter 24/7.

643
00:39:36,463 --> 00:39:38,013
- Thank you.

644
00:39:38,013 --> 00:39:42,179
Has Shawn told you about
the phone call yet?

645
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,664
- What phone call?

646
00:39:43,664 --> 00:39:46,752
- A man left a message on
my husband's cell phone

647
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:48,959
and it sounded threatening.

648
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:51,876
- No, uh, could you play it for us?

649
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,913
- Sure.

650
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:59,374
- [Gregor] John, John, John. (laughs)

651
00:39:59,374 --> 00:40:01,702
It's Gregor. (speaking foreign language)

652
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:03,964
You got two days, man.

653
00:40:03,964 --> 00:40:07,396
Two days to deliver my groceries.

654
00:40:07,396 --> 00:40:10,546
- Mrs. Robertson, could you
forward your husband's number

655
00:40:10,546 --> 00:40:14,212
to my phone, so I can answer all calls?

656
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:17,819
- Yeah, I, I, I think I can do that.

657
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:22,819
- My number is 8-1-8-5-5-5-0-1-0-0.

658
00:40:23,363 --> 00:40:26,435
- Uh, Mrs. Robertson, can you
think of anybody down here

659
00:40:26,435 --> 00:40:29,165
who your husband was
still doing business with?

660
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:32,051
- Or, does he have any friends in L.A.?

661
00:40:32,051 --> 00:40:36,263
- Well, he did have a, a
business partner a few years ago.

662
00:40:36,263 --> 00:40:37,193
- Name?

663
00:40:37,193 --> 00:40:39,193
- Anthony Miller.

664
00:40:39,193 --> 00:40:41,030
I can text you his number if you like.

665
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:43,805
He was an accountant just like my husband.

666
00:40:43,805 --> 00:40:48,222
- Thank you. And uh, try
not to worry Mrs. Robertson.

667
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:52,074
I am personally watching Vicki.

668
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:55,780
- Thank you, Mr. Ardalan.

669
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,613
I'll be flying to L.A. in the
next couple of days, so, um,

670
00:41:02,345 --> 00:41:03,178
thank you.

671
00:41:04,401 --> 00:41:06,901
(phone beeps)

672
00:41:20,101 --> 00:41:23,268
(deep haunting music)

673
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:27,782
- Girl's at this address.

674
00:41:29,882 --> 00:41:32,810
- Do we need heat on this, Mr. Sarkoff?

675
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:35,560
- Heat? Yeah, bring your bazooka.

676
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,371
Dummy, she's a 20-year-old girl.

677
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,987
Bring her to my office,
I'll be there in an hour.

678
00:41:41,987 --> 00:41:43,070
- You got it.

679
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:49,500
(Gregor sighs)

680
00:41:51,256 --> 00:41:52,089
- Mishka.

681
00:41:58,163 --> 00:42:00,814
(Gregor sighs heavily)

682
00:42:00,814 --> 00:42:04,314
He was a very important client last night.

683
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,456
(Mishka winces)

684
00:42:12,956 --> 00:42:15,539
(Mishka gasps)

685
00:42:26,595 --> 00:42:27,428
You do,

686
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,278
(Mishka winces)

687
00:42:31,278 --> 00:42:33,528
whatever he asks you to do.

688
00:42:36,322 --> 00:42:37,155
(Mishka gasps)

689
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:39,822
(phone ringing)

690
00:42:43,225 --> 00:42:45,793
(Rudy sighs)

691
00:42:45,793 --> 00:42:48,246
(Rudy clears throat)

692
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:50,047
- Morning, boss.

693
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:52,167
- Rudy, everything okay there?

694
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:54,500
- Yeah, it's all a-okay.

695
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,083
- Good. Go home. Get some rest.

696
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,805
I'm few minutes away.

697
00:42:59,805 --> 00:43:00,783
- You sure?

698
00:43:00,783 --> 00:43:02,533
- [Ray] Yeah. Thanks.

699
00:43:03,724 --> 00:43:05,474
- All right. Will do.

700
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:20,636
(birds chirping)

701
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:48,955
- There she go. Should we follow her?

702
00:43:48,955 --> 00:43:51,554
- Dummy, she's coming right back, right?

703
00:43:51,554 --> 00:43:52,865
- All right. All right.

704
00:43:52,865 --> 00:43:56,532
We could even wait
inside the house for her.

705
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:01,502
(blows) I guess you don't
care second hand smoke kills,

706
00:44:01,502 --> 00:44:05,585
both like friends and colleagues alike.

707
00:44:05,585 --> 00:44:06,418
- Nope.

708
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:10,778
Jesus man, you whine like a bitch.

709
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:19,198
(tense scary music)

710
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:28,822
- One day, you're gonna
teach me how to do that.

711
00:44:28,822 --> 00:44:30,833
- No can do, my friend.

712
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:32,333
It requires an IQ,

713
00:44:35,413 --> 00:44:37,158
which you don't have.

714
00:44:37,158 --> 00:44:40,408
(scary pounding music)

715
00:45:42,499 --> 00:45:45,636
- Who the hell are you and
what're you doin' here? Hm?

716
00:45:45,636 --> 00:45:49,636
(intruder grunting and yelling)

717
00:46:00,213 --> 00:46:03,095
(adventurous music)

718
00:46:03,095 --> 00:46:03,928
- No!

719
00:46:04,959 --> 00:46:05,951
No!

720
00:46:05,951 --> 00:46:08,618
- Don't you even think about it.

721
00:46:09,637 --> 00:46:11,456
- Let go of me.

722
00:46:11,456 --> 00:46:14,623
(upbeat techno music)

723
00:46:18,444 --> 00:46:20,944
(door creaks)

724
00:46:22,524 --> 00:46:24,941
(Ray groans)

725
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,950
(gentle piano music)

726
00:46:35,511 --> 00:46:36,761
Don't touch me.

727
00:46:39,724 --> 00:46:42,301
Who are you really, and what's going on?

728
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:45,301
(slow somber music)

729
00:46:47,442 --> 00:46:49,025
- Call your mother.

730
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,507
- What?

731
00:46:51,507 --> 00:46:52,763
- Call her.

732
00:46:52,763 --> 00:46:55,346
(gentle music)

733
00:46:56,812 --> 00:46:58,190
- [Vicki] You should've told me.

734
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,258
- [Mona] I didn't wanna worry you, honey.

735
00:47:00,258 --> 00:47:02,446
- [Vicki] What does all
this have to do with?

736
00:47:02,446 --> 00:47:04,346
- It has to do with your father.

737
00:47:04,346 --> 00:47:07,429
He was involved in some bad business.

738
00:47:08,322 --> 00:47:10,223
- Jesus, figures.

739
00:47:10,223 --> 00:47:12,408
- Listen, sweetheart, I
want you to do everything

740
00:47:12,408 --> 00:47:13,805
that man tells you to do.

741
00:47:13,805 --> 00:47:14,642
And in the meantime,

742
00:47:14,642 --> 00:47:16,328
I'm gonna book you a plane ticket

743
00:47:16,328 --> 00:47:18,333
and get you back home, okay?

744
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:22,697
- No. I can't do that, I
need tomorrow. Remember?

745
00:47:22,697 --> 00:47:24,722
The agency meeting?

746
00:47:24,722 --> 00:47:26,222
- Yes, I remember.

747
00:47:28,882 --> 00:47:31,299
Put him on the phone, please.

748
00:47:41,023 --> 00:47:41,975
- Yeah?

749
00:47:41,975 --> 00:47:45,590
- Mr. Ardalan, you're
all I have right now.

750
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:48,387
So, I'm going to do
whatever you ask me to do,

751
00:47:48,387 --> 00:47:50,864
because she doesn't want to come home.

752
00:47:50,864 --> 00:47:53,390
- Let me talk to her.
I'll get back to you.

753
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:54,390
- Please do.

754
00:47:57,462 --> 00:47:58,889
- [Ray] We're leaving.

755
00:47:58,889 --> 00:47:59,769
- [Vicki] Why?

756
00:47:59,769 --> 00:48:03,602
- Just don't argue, if
you wanna stay in town.

757
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:10,306
(gentle music)

758
00:48:14,464 --> 00:48:16,525
- Where are we going?

759
00:48:16,525 --> 00:48:17,692
- To my place.

760
00:48:20,191 --> 00:48:22,378
- You know you could've,
could've told me who you were,

761
00:48:22,378 --> 00:48:24,378
and what you were doing.

762
00:48:27,209 --> 00:48:29,169
- I'm doing my job.

763
00:48:29,169 --> 00:48:30,002
- Yeah.

764
00:48:31,921 --> 00:48:33,732
I actually thought we were friends.

765
00:48:33,732 --> 00:48:36,315
(somber music)

766
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:04,916
Where's the wife, Ray?

767
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:11,436
Figures you'd be alone.

768
00:49:12,855 --> 00:49:15,445
I have this birthday thing
for my friend Jenny tonight.

769
00:49:15,445 --> 00:49:16,986
- Not a good idea.

770
00:49:16,986 --> 00:49:19,403
- Why worry? You'll be there.

771
00:49:30,979 --> 00:49:33,646
(phone buzzing)

772
00:49:38,956 --> 00:49:40,534
- Yeah?

773
00:49:40,534 --> 00:49:44,473
- This obviously is not
John. Who the fuck is this?

774
00:49:44,473 --> 00:49:46,306
- What is it you need?

775
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:48,900
- Let me guess.

776
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,046
You're the tough guy who
poked fun at my friends.

777
00:49:52,046 --> 00:49:53,008
Am I right?

778
00:49:53,008 --> 00:49:55,430
You're the watchdog.

779
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:57,537
- It's about money, isn't it?

780
00:49:57,537 --> 00:49:58,388
(jaw pops)

781
00:49:58,388 --> 00:50:00,146
- Brilliant. You're a fuckin' genius.

782
00:50:00,146 --> 00:50:01,543
Yeah it's about money.

783
00:50:01,543 --> 00:50:05,620
Her cheat of a father
stole 1.3 mil from me.

784
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,734
So she's mine as collateral.

785
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:09,514
- Maybe we should meet.

786
00:50:09,514 --> 00:50:11,097
- Uh, a negotiator.

787
00:50:13,085 --> 00:50:15,933
Yeah, why don't we do that. Two hours.

788
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:16,766
- Fine.

789
00:50:16,766 --> 00:50:20,016
- I'll call ya, and give ya an address.

790
00:50:25,831 --> 00:50:27,607
(phone buzzes)

791
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:28,774
- Yeah, Shawn?

792
00:50:30,052 --> 00:50:31,904
Yes, I'll be there.

793
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:34,904
(mysterious music)

794
00:50:57,164 --> 00:50:58,081
- Hey. Ray.

795
00:51:00,029 --> 00:51:03,510
This is detective Scott Jackson.

796
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:04,927
He's good people.

797
00:51:07,662 --> 00:51:10,254
I got the info on your guy.

798
00:51:10,254 --> 00:51:11,754
Anthony Miller is,

799
00:51:14,191 --> 00:51:15,024
he's dead.

800
00:51:16,722 --> 00:51:19,805
Some kind of accident six months ago.

801
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:24,418
- From what I understand,

802
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:27,735
you may be getting yourself
into some hot water.

803
00:51:27,735 --> 00:51:29,855
- Scott is right.

804
00:51:29,855 --> 00:51:33,688
Maybe the best thing is
to send the girl home.

805
00:51:34,709 --> 00:51:36,124
- And then what?

806
00:51:36,124 --> 00:51:38,950
- She's not your problem anymore.

807
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:40,867
Even if she stays here,

808
00:51:42,621 --> 00:51:44,912
there's not a whole lot we can do.

809
00:51:44,912 --> 00:51:47,610
- We need direct evidence,
not circumstantial.

810
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:50,221
We don't even know who's after her.

811
00:51:50,221 --> 00:51:51,784
- So basically you can
come into the picture

812
00:51:51,784 --> 00:51:53,635
when she's hurt.

813
00:51:53,635 --> 00:51:55,685
- You want her safe, send her home.

814
00:51:55,685 --> 00:51:57,418
- What if I find out who's in charge?

815
00:51:57,418 --> 00:52:00,027
- That's not your job, Ray?

816
00:52:00,027 --> 00:52:04,027
- Is there something
you're not telling us, Ray?

817
00:52:05,548 --> 00:52:07,266
- I'll let you know when I do.

818
00:52:07,266 --> 00:52:11,932
- Listen, pal, there's some
well-connected people out there,

819
00:52:11,932 --> 00:52:16,765
and I mean legitimately-connected
people, with higher-ups.

820
00:52:20,914 --> 00:52:22,331
Can't touch them.

821
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:30,237
This accident Anthony had may
not have been an accident.

822
00:52:31,478 --> 00:52:33,430
If these guys are after the girl's father

823
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:37,491
and then the ex-partner ends
up dead, I don't buy it.

824
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:39,881
- And yet, you just want her to go home.

825
00:52:39,881 --> 00:52:43,881
- Yes. Believe me, this
is the best thing to do.

826
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,424
- So sometimes it's better
to let things go, right?

827
00:52:50,424 --> 00:52:54,908
- Look Ray, I know you're
chasing a ghost from the past,

828
00:52:54,908 --> 00:52:57,918
but don't confuse the situation.

829
00:52:57,918 --> 00:53:01,251
- Sorry about your wife. But he's right.

830
00:53:07,949 --> 00:53:09,532
- I'll talk to her.

831
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:20,277
- Sorry, Shawn. He's
not gonna talk to her.

832
00:53:20,277 --> 00:53:23,194
(knocking at door)

833
00:53:37,211 --> 00:53:38,411
- Hi.

834
00:53:38,411 --> 00:53:39,244
- Hi.

835
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:41,570
Who are you?

836
00:53:42,826 --> 00:53:43,826
Where's Ray?

837
00:53:45,081 --> 00:53:46,914
- That's a long story.

838
00:53:48,431 --> 00:53:49,264
Come in.

839
00:53:54,237 --> 00:53:57,320

- Excuse me.

854
00:55:05,527 --> 00:55:06,673
- I'm not packing.

855
00:55:06,673 --> 00:55:08,006
- Of course not.

856
00:55:14,661 --> 00:55:15,578
He's clean.

857
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:20,813
(techno dance music in background)

858
00:55:25,383 --> 00:55:26,383
- You smoke?

859
00:55:27,794 --> 00:55:30,196
Me neither. (laughs)

860
00:55:30,196 --> 00:55:31,744
See these things? Huh?

861
00:55:31,744 --> 00:55:35,084
They're all the rage,
right? It's uh, vapor.

862
00:55:35,084 --> 00:55:38,145
I don't particularly enjoy smoking,

863
00:55:38,145 --> 00:55:41,728
but I'm enjoying this,
you suck on one end,

864
00:55:42,565 --> 00:55:44,261
right, and the other end just lights up.

865
00:55:44,261 --> 00:55:46,796
Just like Mishka. (chuckles)

866
00:55:46,796 --> 00:55:48,553
So here's the sitch.

867
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:53,553
Back in the glory days of the
grand economy, I had uh John,

868
00:55:53,854 --> 00:55:55,673
he was one of my
accountants and there was,

869
00:55:55,673 --> 00:55:57,770
there was a lotta cash involved,

870
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,299
a whole lotta cash, we were
always making tons of money.

871
00:55:59,299 --> 00:56:03,299
It was fantastic. Crash
hit, lost all our money.

872
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:06,805
We all went our own separate ways,

873
00:56:06,805 --> 00:56:09,972
then a couple years later, I find out,

874
00:56:12,263 --> 00:56:15,220
ole Johnny boy, he goes up to Canada,

875
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:19,053
and he starts investing
in apartment buildings

876
00:56:19,975 --> 00:56:21,808
with my fucking money.

877
00:56:25,705 --> 00:56:29,506
Money that he embezzled from me, see.

878
00:56:29,506 --> 00:56:32,006
Now imagine my disappointment.

879
00:56:33,344 --> 00:56:37,094
- Well, the bad news
is, Johnny is in a coma.

880
00:56:42,428 --> 00:56:45,600
(jaw popping)

881
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,433
- In a coma? Jesus fucking Christ.

882
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:52,691
Well, that is bad news.

883
00:56:52,691 --> 00:56:55,229
Be sure to send some
flowers by in the morning,

884
00:56:55,229 --> 00:56:59,356
but as I'm sure you'll agree,
at least until he wakes up,

885
00:56:59,356 --> 00:57:03,183
I gotta have myself a
little bit of collateral.

886
00:57:03,183 --> 00:57:05,255
And she's pretty, isn't she?

887
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,672
So sweet, innocent. Beautiful young girl.

888
00:57:10,952 --> 00:57:11,927
(Gregor laughs)

889
00:57:11,927 --> 00:57:14,760
- What if I can get you the money?

890
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:18,246
- Who the fuck are you

891
00:57:18,246 --> 00:57:21,579
to come up with that kind of bling, huh?

892
00:57:25,122 --> 00:57:29,455
- I need two weeks. And you
stay away from the girl.

893
00:57:36,648 --> 00:57:39,315
(Gregor laughs)

894
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:44,325
- I'm gonna give you two days.

895
00:57:44,325 --> 00:57:45,492
Two days, Ray.

896
00:57:54,282 --> 00:57:55,115
Hey, Ray.

897
00:57:59,408 --> 00:58:03,709
It's between you and me
now, you understand that?

898
00:58:03,709 --> 00:58:06,959
(relaxed techno music)

899
00:58:16,615 --> 00:58:19,239
Find out where he and
the girl are staying.

900
00:58:19,239 --> 00:58:20,848
- Gregor, he's not stupid.

901
00:58:20,848 --> 00:58:21,773
He will expect us.

902
00:58:21,773 --> 00:58:25,578
- Well then be less
stupid, and hide your ass!

903
00:58:25,578 --> 00:58:28,186
♪ Before the suffering sacrifice
to make your voice scream ♪

904
00:58:28,186 --> 00:58:29,629
♪ Scream off the suffering ♪

905
00:58:29,629 --> 00:58:31,834
♪ Before the sacrifice to mean something ♪

906
00:58:31,834 --> 00:58:33,690
♪ It means something ♪

907
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:36,371
♪ Some mean something, some mean nothing ♪

908
00:58:36,371 --> 00:58:40,734
♪ Could it ever mean nothing ♪

909
00:58:40,734 --> 00:58:44,151
- Ray's wife was killed in a hit and run.

910
00:58:52,771 --> 00:58:54,604
She was also pregnant.

911
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:59,908
- I don't even know what to say.

912
00:58:59,908 --> 00:59:01,241
That's horrible.

913
00:59:02,552 --> 00:59:05,117
- Auntie Roya was sweet.

914
00:59:05,117 --> 00:59:07,256
She was like you.

915
00:59:07,256 --> 00:59:08,089
Beautiful.

916
00:59:10,929 --> 00:59:14,346
Anyway, after that Ray became very quiet.

917
00:59:16,879 --> 00:59:18,832
- I can't imagine him being any different.

918
00:59:18,832 --> 00:59:23,832
- (chuckles) Well, he
wasn't always so quiet.

919
00:59:23,836 --> 00:59:25,086
Reserved, yes.

920
00:59:26,822 --> 00:59:29,402
But I know when he was managing clubs

921
00:59:29,402 --> 00:59:32,266
before he married my aunt,

922
00:59:32,266 --> 00:59:35,766
he was a man about town, and he was loyal.

923
00:59:39,189 --> 00:59:40,106
Very loyal.

924
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:44,817
But you never wanted to see him angry.

925
00:59:48,114 --> 00:59:50,531
Ray does things on his terms.

926
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:53,563
His terms.

927
00:59:59,761 --> 01:00:01,511
- What's in that bag?

928
01:00:03,459 --> 01:00:07,243
- His medications that
he hasn't been taking.

929
01:00:07,243 --> 01:00:09,910
- Oh. It's for his heart, right?

930
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,793
(insects buzzing)

931
01:00:37,328 --> 01:00:40,078
(haunting music)

932
01:00:49,999 --> 01:00:52,916
(door clicks open)

933
01:00:55,521 --> 01:00:59,109
(door clicks shut)

934
01:00:59,109 --> 01:01:01,660
- [Yasi] Hi, Uncle Ray.

935
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:04,728
- Yasi, what are you
doing here? Where is she?

936
01:01:04,728 --> 01:01:09,311
- Relax. She's in the bathroom,
primping for her party.

937
01:01:10,983 --> 01:01:13,974
You, my friend, look horrible.

938
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:15,163
- It's nothing.

939
01:01:15,163 --> 01:01:15,996
- Right.

940
01:01:17,357 --> 01:01:19,809
Dad knew you wouldn't
fill these prescriptions,

941
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:22,163
so he had me do it for you.

942
01:01:22,163 --> 01:01:24,913
I'm gonna load you up, right now.

943
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:40,885
And this is the nitroglycerin
for when the pain kicks in.

944
01:01:40,885 --> 01:01:44,135
Under the tongue, sir. Doctor's orders.

945
01:01:46,429 --> 01:01:48,834
- You treat me like a kid, kiddo.

946
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:50,800
- You're still my uncle.

947
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,141
I gotta roll.

948
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:56,724
I gotta study for a big
European history test tomorrow.

949
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:02,662
- Yasi.

950
01:02:05,403 --> 01:02:06,236
Thanks.

951
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:09,986
- She's a good girl.

952
01:02:10,883 --> 01:02:14,883
A little scared, but I
know she's in good hands.

953
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,653
(keys clatter)

954
01:02:34,837 --> 01:02:38,004
(gentle somber music)

955
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:01,981
- I didn't have time to
take all my clothes so,

956
01:03:01,981 --> 01:03:04,316
I took a dress from the closet.

957
01:03:04,316 --> 01:03:05,733
Hope that's okay?

958
01:03:07,357 --> 01:03:10,857
(gentle sorrowful music)

959
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,283
- We're not staying long.

960
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:24,580
(techno dance music)
(patrons chattering)

961
01:03:38,466 --> 01:03:39,549
- Whoo!

962
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:42,216
All right, all right, all right.

963
01:03:46,435 --> 01:03:47,268
Yeah.

964
01:03:48,382 --> 01:03:51,382
Whoo! Birthday girl, happy birthday.

965
01:03:52,911 --> 01:03:53,744
Cheers.

966
01:03:54,755 --> 01:03:59,755
(techno dance music)
(crowd chatters excitedly)

967
01:04:11,544 --> 01:04:13,294
Come on, let's dance.

968
01:04:14,316 --> 01:04:15,421
- I don't dance.

969
01:04:15,421 --> 01:04:16,542
- Please?

970
01:04:16,542 --> 01:04:19,186
- You go and have fun.

971
01:04:19,186 --> 01:04:21,798
- Come on, girl, let's move.

972
01:04:21,798 --> 01:04:26,798
(techno dance music)
(crowd chattering)

973
01:04:52,214 --> 01:04:54,510
- Hey, hey. What's up, Dad?

974
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:56,324
- It's fine, Ray.

975
01:04:56,324 --> 01:04:59,741
He's a dancer. You don't wanna dance, so.

976
01:05:01,252 --> 01:05:03,926
Yeah, if you don't want to.

977
01:05:03,926 --> 01:05:07,009
(techno dance music)

978
01:05:23,355 --> 01:05:24,188
- [Ray] Time to go.

979
01:05:24,188 --> 01:05:25,480
- You again?

980
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,296
(Ray thuds)
(Vicki gasps)

981
01:05:27,296 --> 01:05:28,796
What do you got?

982
01:05:28,796 --> 01:05:29,629
(man grunts)

983
01:05:29,629 --> 01:05:30,752
(woman screams)

984
01:05:30,752 --> 01:05:31,835
Hey, old man!

985
01:05:32,669 --> 01:05:36,336
(men grunting and groaning)

986
01:05:38,848 --> 01:05:40,286
(man groans)

987
01:05:40,286 --> 01:05:43,953
(upbeat techno dance music)

988
01:06:23,976 --> 01:06:26,350
- Ray, I'm sorry, okay?

989
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:27,357
I'm really sorry.

990
01:06:27,357 --> 01:06:30,250
(tense music)

991
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:34,087
- He want to see if he can trust you.

992
01:06:34,087 --> 01:06:36,587
(tense music)

993
01:06:37,988 --> 01:06:38,993
- Don't.

994
01:06:38,993 --> 01:06:41,660
(Mishka groans)

995
01:06:45,306 --> 01:06:47,184
- You fix her up, then bring her back.

996
01:06:47,184 --> 01:06:50,869
Do anything different, the deal's off.

997
01:06:50,869 --> 01:06:54,171
You know what the hell that means.

998
01:06:54,171 --> 01:06:56,921
(haunting music)

999
01:07:12,909 --> 01:07:15,369
(Mishka whimpers)

1000
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:18,305
- Get some towels and water.

1001
01:07:18,305 --> 01:07:19,888
Just hang in there.

1002
01:07:22,476 --> 01:07:25,393
(telephone rings)

1003
01:07:43,412 --> 01:07:46,579
- Boss, what kind of job did you take?

1004
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:52,310
- It's complicated.

1005
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:54,512
- What's the plan?

1006
01:07:54,512 --> 01:07:56,345
- I need a safe house.

1007
01:07:57,357 --> 01:07:59,559
- I think I know the right spot.

1008
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:01,642
It's a little outta town.

1009
01:08:04,125 --> 01:08:06,367
- I was so afraid.

1010
01:08:06,367 --> 01:08:10,450
Who were these people?
And what did my father do?

1011
01:08:11,667 --> 01:08:16,533
She was cut up like a piece
of meat. Fuckin' animals.

1012
01:08:16,533 --> 01:08:19,938
(tense pulsating music)

1013
01:08:19,938 --> 01:08:21,521
- Who was the girl?

1014
01:08:23,616 --> 01:08:26,153
- It was the first time I saw her.

1015
01:08:26,153 --> 01:08:27,820
- What was her name?

1016
01:08:29,256 --> 01:08:30,089
- Mishka.

1017
01:08:32,314 --> 01:08:34,945
- Did she have a last name?

1018
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:36,112
- Only Mishka.

1019
01:08:38,377 --> 01:08:39,693
Doctor fixed her up real good,

1020
01:08:39,693 --> 01:08:42,189
and we headed to his friend's house.

1021
01:08:42,189 --> 01:08:46,015
- Where was this place?
In town, out of town?

1022
01:08:46,015 --> 01:08:48,055
- I don't know.

1023
01:08:48,055 --> 01:08:50,330
We drove for about an hour.

1024
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:52,913
I think we took the five north.

1025
01:08:53,827 --> 01:08:56,188
- Do you remember the doctor's name?

1026
01:08:56,188 --> 01:08:57,296
- [Vicki] I don't know.

1027
01:08:57,296 --> 01:08:59,024
- Who was he? Friend of Ray's?

1028
01:08:59,024 --> 01:09:01,493
- I just told you, okay. I don't know.

1029
01:09:01,493 --> 01:09:02,969
Maybe he wasn't even a real doctor, okay.

1030
01:09:02,969 --> 01:09:04,995
He sewed her up and left.

1031
01:09:04,995 --> 01:09:07,495
(tense music)

1032
01:09:11,276 --> 01:09:14,193
(insects chirping)

1033
01:09:15,476 --> 01:09:16,736
(Mishka whimpers)

1034
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:20,153
- It's okay, sweetheart. You're safe now.

1035
01:09:22,185 --> 01:09:24,852
(Mishka groans)

1036
01:09:57,939 --> 01:09:58,939
- Thank you.

1037
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:04,814
- You need to rest.

1038
01:10:09,697 --> 01:10:12,697
- I need to go back. I must go back.

1039
01:10:14,199 --> 01:10:15,801
- You don't have to do that.

1040
01:10:15,801 --> 01:10:19,646
- [Vicki] They almost killed you tonight.

1041
01:10:19,646 --> 01:10:22,729
- You don't understand. I can't hide.

1042
01:10:25,016 --> 01:10:27,026
- It's all right, honey.

1043
01:10:27,026 --> 01:10:28,556
We'll talk about it in the morning, okay.

1044
01:10:28,556 --> 01:10:32,056
You just need to sleep. You need to sleep.

1045
01:10:37,623 --> 01:10:40,540
(liquid dribbling)

1046
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:55,816
Where'd all this go?

1047
01:10:58,541 --> 01:10:59,458
Your smile?

1048
01:11:01,782 --> 01:11:02,615
Joy?

1049
01:11:04,351 --> 01:11:06,477
You know, they say that
there are things in life

1050
01:11:06,477 --> 01:11:08,894
that we have no control over.

1051
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:13,213
There're things we do.

1052
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,037
Smiling is one of them.

1053
01:11:31,934 --> 01:11:35,219
Ray, I need to know the truth.

1054
01:11:35,219 --> 01:11:36,719
Please talk to me.

1055
01:11:42,378 --> 01:11:44,253
- It's about money.

1056
01:11:44,253 --> 01:11:46,458
Money your father took from some people.

1057
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:48,375
- What money? How much?

1058
01:11:49,557 --> 01:11:51,640
All, all this over money?

1059
01:11:52,754 --> 01:11:56,745
And, why is Mom involved?
Isn't that Dad's problem?

1060
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:58,412
Did you talk to him?

1061
01:11:59,252 --> 01:12:00,178
- No.

1062
01:12:00,178 --> 01:12:02,623
- Then why don't you?

1063
01:12:02,623 --> 01:12:04,706
- You don't know, do you?

1064
01:12:06,248 --> 01:12:08,015
(cup thuds)

1065
01:12:08,015 --> 01:12:11,765
- Know what? That, that
he's in the hospital?

1066
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:15,808
- She didn't tell you, did she?

1067
01:12:15,808 --> 01:12:17,110
- Tell me what?

1068
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:20,693
- That's your fa-, (sighs)

1069
01:12:22,002 --> 01:12:24,502
That your father is in a coma.

1070
01:12:31,729 --> 01:12:32,729
- Oh my god.

1071
01:12:35,661 --> 01:12:37,303
Poor mother.

1072
01:12:37,303 --> 01:12:40,553
(gentle somber music)

1073
01:12:57,346 --> 01:12:58,429
This is real.

1074
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:02,983
How much money does Dad owe?

1075
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,277
- A lot. And we only have two days.

1076
01:13:09,008 --> 01:13:10,575
- Two days?

1077
01:13:10,575 --> 01:13:14,373
And what, what if we can't
pay? What happens then?

1078
01:13:14,373 --> 01:13:17,149
And, what does Mishka
have to do with all this?

1079
01:13:17,149 --> 01:13:19,232
Is she, is she a warning?

1080
01:13:23,628 --> 01:13:25,128
She is, isn't she?

1081
01:13:28,118 --> 01:13:30,035
What if I go back home?

1082
01:13:31,952 --> 01:13:33,025
Say something.

1083
01:13:33,025 --> 01:13:35,121
- It's up to you.

1084
01:13:35,121 --> 01:13:39,204
If they got to your dad,
they can get to you too.

1085
01:13:42,288 --> 01:13:44,468
- Well, what if we call the cops?

1086
01:13:44,468 --> 01:13:49,468
- (scoffs softly) It's
more complicated than that.

1087
01:13:49,661 --> 01:13:52,744
(gentle piano music)

1088
01:13:58,878 --> 01:14:00,491
(crickets chirping)

1089
01:14:00,491 --> 01:14:03,408
(mysterious music)

1090
01:14:16,604 --> 01:14:19,187
(gentle music)

1091
01:14:50,801 --> 01:14:52,301
- I was so afraid.

1092
01:14:55,945 --> 01:15:00,945
(wind whipping)
(birds chirping)

1093
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:05,520
Ray, Ray, wake up.

1094
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,934
She's gone.

1095
01:15:06,934 --> 01:15:10,434
(tense adventurous music)

1096
01:15:32,915 --> 01:15:36,082
(gentle somber music)

1097
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:54,894
Why, why'd she leave?

1098
01:15:54,894 --> 01:15:56,940
She could have gotten
away from those bastards.

1099
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:59,107
- I know. She's terrified.

1100
01:16:00,004 --> 01:16:04,302
(sighs) It's typical, trying
to return to her tormentor.

1101
01:16:04,302 --> 01:16:06,319
- But they're gonna kill her, eventually.

1102
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:08,888
- She's already dead inside.

1103
01:16:08,888 --> 01:16:13,577
- Poor girl. Every dream she
had is just gone or lost.

1104
01:16:13,577 --> 01:16:15,414
Everything seems so
unimportant and trivial,

1105
01:16:15,414 --> 01:16:16,485
my modeling career.

1106
01:16:16,485 --> 01:16:18,315
- Vicki, what is it you want?

1107
01:16:18,315 --> 01:16:19,241
- I wanna live, okay?

1108
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:21,678
I don't wanna be like Mishka.

1109
01:16:21,678 --> 01:16:23,653
I'm not going back home.

1110
01:16:23,653 --> 01:16:25,756
- What time is your meeting?

1111
01:16:25,756 --> 01:16:26,923
- A few hours.

1112
01:16:29,627 --> 01:16:32,960
- Come on, get cleaned up and beautiful.

1113
01:17:02,271 --> 01:17:03,929
(elevator dings)

1114
01:17:03,929 --> 01:17:07,346
(computer keys clicking)

1115
01:17:08,338 --> 01:17:10,320
- They're ready for you, Miss Robertson.

1116
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,320
- Thank you.

1117
01:17:15,479 --> 01:17:16,562
Wish me luck.

1118
01:17:17,578 --> 01:17:19,411
- You don't need luck.

1119
01:17:25,753 --> 01:17:29,170
(computer keys clicking)

1120
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:31,742
- Miss Robertson.
- Hi.

1121
01:17:31,742 --> 01:17:32,575
- May I call you Vicki?

1122
01:17:32,575 --> 01:17:33,539
- Yes, of course.

1123
01:17:33,539 --> 01:17:34,917
- Thank you.

1124
01:17:34,917 --> 01:17:37,250
Well, looking at and judging
from your modeling photos,

1125
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,851
Vicki, we can appreciate your uniqueness

1126
01:17:39,851 --> 01:17:42,481
and we can see the passion in your eyes.

1127
01:17:42,481 --> 01:17:46,523
But as you know, this campaign
is not just about beauty

1128
01:17:46,523 --> 01:17:47,829
and still photography.

1129
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:48,733
- Yes.

1130
01:17:48,733 --> 01:17:51,986
We need to make sure that
the essence that you capture

1131
01:17:51,986 --> 01:17:54,488
in your photos translates to film.

1132
01:17:54,488 --> 01:17:56,772
- I know it's a short notice.

1133
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:59,334
Let your folks know I'll
be stopping by tonight.

1134
01:17:59,334 --> 01:18:00,834
Thanks, Yasi. Bye.

1135
01:18:02,524 --> 01:18:05,516
- Everyone needs a partner,
for different reasons.

1136
01:18:05,516 --> 01:18:08,516
Use my reason, for no reason at all.

1137
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:18,317
- Very nice. Thank you, Ms. Robertson.

1138
01:18:26,077 --> 01:18:29,815
- I'm sorry. Could I, could I
do that one more time, please?

1139
01:18:29,815 --> 01:18:30,815
- All right.

1140
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:38,373
- Everyone needs a partner
for different reasons.

1141
01:18:38,373 --> 01:18:43,373
With the right partner, use my
reason, for no reason at all.

1142
01:18:48,538 --> 01:18:51,621
- Vicki, why did you change the copy?

1143
01:18:53,054 --> 01:18:56,447
- I wanted to make it more personal.

1144
01:18:56,447 --> 01:18:57,731
- Personal?

1145
01:18:57,731 --> 01:19:00,699
- Yeah, well, my reason
tells me this product

1146
01:19:00,699 --> 01:19:03,152
is about trust and loyalty,

1147
01:19:03,152 --> 01:19:05,355
with the right partner, that is.

1148
01:19:05,355 --> 01:19:08,226
Well, trust and loyalty are
the most important virtues

1149
01:19:08,226 --> 01:19:12,309
in a man for any woman,
no matter how old she is.

1150
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:16,418
(intriguing music)

1151
01:19:19,202 --> 01:19:21,310
- Ms. Robertson, will
you give us a few minutes

1152
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:22,610
and step outside?

1153
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:23,443
- Sure.

1154
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:27,720
(uplifted music)

1155
01:19:49,095 --> 01:19:50,730
- Miss Robertson, I'm
afraid you'll be staying

1156
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:54,734
in the United States
longer than you expected.

1157
01:19:54,734 --> 01:19:57,143
- What does that mean?

1158
01:19:57,143 --> 01:20:00,175
- We'll be contacting your agent.

1159
01:20:00,175 --> 01:20:03,092
(intriguing music)

1160
01:20:09,581 --> 01:20:12,219
- Now I actually have a
reason to call my mom.

1161
01:20:12,219 --> 01:20:16,302
You have no idea how
important this job is to me.

1162
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:22,173
Ray! Ray!

1163
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:26,166
Let go of me.

1164
01:20:26,166 --> 01:20:27,650
- Shut up.

1165
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:30,150
(tense music)

1166
01:20:33,772 --> 01:20:36,439
- [Kidnapper] Don't be foolish.

1167
01:20:38,345 --> 01:20:39,748
- [Ray] I have one more day.

1168
01:20:39,748 --> 01:20:41,248
- Yes, yes you do.

1169
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:44,930
(Vicki gasps)

1170
01:20:46,928 --> 01:20:51,345
Nothing will happen to her,
if you keep your promise.

1171
01:20:53,228 --> 01:20:54,466
Bye now.

1172
01:20:54,466 --> 01:20:56,966
(tense music)

1173
01:21:07,004 --> 01:21:11,837
- You fucking broke my nose (indistinct).

1174
01:21:15,641 --> 01:21:18,308
(feet thudding)

1175
01:21:27,207 --> 01:21:30,444
(dramatic bang)

1176
01:21:30,444 --> 01:21:34,745
(police radio chattering)

1177
01:21:34,745 --> 01:21:37,662
- [Paramedic] You're gonna be fine.

1178
01:21:40,216 --> 01:21:42,956
- Ray, what the hell happened?

1179
01:21:42,956 --> 01:21:44,820
What's going on?

1180
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:46,765
Why don't you answer my calls?

1181
01:21:46,765 --> 01:21:49,787
- According to Ray here,
they snatched the girl.

1182
01:21:49,787 --> 01:21:53,195
- Dammit, I told you
she had to be sent home.

1183
01:21:53,195 --> 01:21:56,209
- We don't have time for this.
She needs us more than ever.

1184
01:21:56,209 --> 01:21:59,540
- Us? This is a police matter now.

1185
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:02,062
- You're gonna let us
handle this from here.

1186
01:22:02,062 --> 01:22:03,176
You're out.

1187
01:22:03,176 --> 01:22:05,054
- You need me to get to these people.

1188
01:22:05,054 --> 01:22:06,776
- We need you to go down to the station

1189
01:22:06,776 --> 01:22:08,267
and give us a statement.

1190
01:22:08,267 --> 01:22:10,902
- Don't you get it? We don't have time.

1191
01:22:10,902 --> 01:22:13,928
You need subpoenas,
warrants. It takes too long.

1192
01:22:13,928 --> 01:22:17,691
- I don't need you to
tell me how to do my job.

1193
01:22:17,691 --> 01:22:19,941
If you had taken my advice,

1194
01:22:20,867 --> 01:22:22,418
we wouldn't even be talking right now.

1195
01:22:22,418 --> 01:22:25,585
- I'm done talking. What is your plan?

1196
01:22:27,161 --> 01:22:29,034
- Well, obviously they
need something from you.

1197
01:22:29,034 --> 01:22:31,617
They'll contact you, they'll...

1198
01:22:32,528 --> 01:22:35,011
Shawn, you get him down to the station.

1199
01:22:35,011 --> 01:22:36,761
I need a full report.

1200
01:22:41,596 --> 01:22:43,513
- Can I get some water?

1201
01:22:44,945 --> 01:22:47,278
- Sure. I see what I can do.

1202
01:22:58,411 --> 01:23:00,487
(door bangs)

1203
01:23:00,487 --> 01:23:03,404
(intriguing music)

1204
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:15,400
- Tell me she's as safe
as a baby in its bed.

1205
01:23:17,406 --> 01:23:20,158
- He'd like to talk to you.

1206
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:21,348
- Ray?

1207
01:23:21,348 --> 01:23:23,171
- Are you okay?

1208
01:23:23,171 --> 01:23:24,588
- Yeah, I am now.

1209
01:23:26,396 --> 01:23:28,146
- You know the rules.

1210
01:23:29,144 --> 01:23:32,042
What's gonna make me happy?

1211
01:23:32,042 --> 01:23:35,002
- The deed to a shopping mall.

1212
01:23:35,002 --> 01:23:36,456
- A property?

1213
01:23:36,456 --> 01:23:38,873
What the fuck am I gonna
do with a shopping mall?

1214
01:23:38,873 --> 01:23:40,637
We were talking cash.

1215
01:23:40,637 --> 01:23:43,887
- It's worth a lot more than you think.

1216
01:23:45,609 --> 01:23:47,859
- Well, I am a businessman.

1217
01:23:48,898 --> 01:23:52,213
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to consider it.

1218
01:23:52,213 --> 01:23:53,841
All right.

1219
01:23:53,841 --> 01:23:55,670
Tell you what, we'll meet tonight.

1220
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:57,806
We'll uh, we'll be in touch.

1221
01:23:57,806 --> 01:24:01,473
Oh, and uh Ray, don't
be stupid. Come alone.

1222
01:24:03,883 --> 01:24:04,919
Otherwise.

1223
01:24:04,919 --> 01:24:06,152
- Don't.

1224
01:24:06,152 --> 01:24:08,652
(Vicki yells)

1225
01:24:13,311 --> 01:24:15,644
(Ray sighs)

1226
01:24:33,277 --> 01:24:35,984
- Thanks for seeing me.

1227
01:24:35,984 --> 01:24:38,073
- Ray, what happened to you here?

1228
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,725
- A small accident.

1229
01:24:39,725 --> 01:24:41,181
- I don't know what's on your mind,

1230
01:24:41,181 --> 01:24:43,268
but I also have all the paperwork ready,

1231
01:24:43,268 --> 01:24:45,561
deed and transfer documents.

1232
01:24:45,561 --> 01:24:50,561
- Fariba, please, let's first
listen to what Ray has to say.

1233
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:57,339
- I don't know how to say
this, but I'm in a situation,

1234
01:24:57,339 --> 01:24:59,385
I cannot give up this property.

1235
01:24:59,385 --> 01:25:01,609
- (scoffs) I knew it from the beginning.

1236
01:25:01,609 --> 01:25:05,014
What did I tell you?
I'm taking you to court.

1237
01:25:05,014 --> 01:25:06,728
Is that what you want?

1238
01:25:06,728 --> 01:25:08,596
- It is his property.

1239
01:25:08,596 --> 01:25:10,231
- And he has the right to keep it.

1240
01:25:10,231 --> 01:25:14,296
- It's none of your business,
Yasiman, stay out of this.

1241
01:25:14,296 --> 01:25:16,450
- I'm sorry to disappoint you.

1242
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:18,495
- Disappoint me? Oh no.

1243
01:25:18,495 --> 01:25:20,863
I was disappointed a long time ago.

1244
01:25:20,863 --> 01:25:23,486
Having you as a brother, that
was disappointing enough.

1245
01:25:23,486 --> 01:25:24,723
- [Hooshang] Fariba.

1246
01:25:24,723 --> 01:25:27,329
- Just looking at you brings
me nothing but sorrow.

1247
01:25:27,329 --> 01:25:28,944
Where's my sister now, huh? She's dead.

1248
01:25:28,944 --> 01:25:30,231
Why not you instead of her?

1249
01:25:30,231 --> 01:25:32,967
- Fariba John. Enough, stop.

1250
01:25:32,967 --> 01:25:35,628
- Mom. Why are you doing this?

1251
01:25:35,628 --> 01:25:38,867
- It's our family property.
He didn't earn it.

1252
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:40,562
- Well, your father gave it to him.

1253
01:25:40,562 --> 01:25:42,263
- And he loved Aunt Roya.

1254
01:25:42,263 --> 01:25:45,318
- Yes, but he couldn't take care of her.

1255
01:25:45,318 --> 01:25:48,065
He wasn't there for her!

1256
01:25:48,065 --> 01:25:49,073
- [Hooshang] It was an accident.

1257
01:25:49,073 --> 01:25:51,005
- But why it happen to my sister, why?

1258
01:25:51,005 --> 01:25:54,865
- Shit happens. It happened to me too.

1259
01:25:54,865 --> 01:25:57,782
- Yasi, what are you talking about?

1260
01:25:59,118 --> 01:26:02,537
- (scoffs) I don't even
know where to start.

1261
01:26:02,537 --> 01:26:04,880
This is why couldn't tell you.

1262
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:05,798
- Tell us what?

1263
01:26:05,798 --> 01:26:09,933
- Anything. You're just
not listening, ever.

1264
01:26:09,933 --> 01:26:11,378
All you do is judge.

1265
01:26:11,378 --> 01:26:13,661
- No, no, we don't judge you, sweetie.

1266
01:26:13,661 --> 01:26:17,869
- There are things I
need her to hear from me.

1267
01:26:17,869 --> 01:26:19,966
Things I couldn't tell you.

1268
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:21,966
- [Fariba] Tell me what?

1269
01:26:22,876 --> 01:26:25,951
- Tell you what happened to me.

1270
01:26:25,951 --> 01:26:28,437
And that this man that you hate so much

1271
01:26:28,437 --> 01:26:30,187
was there to help me.

1272
01:26:33,318 --> 01:26:36,068
- Ray, what is she talking about?

1273
01:26:40,099 --> 01:26:44,167
- Yasi, you can talk to
me. I'm listening, okay?

1274
01:26:44,167 --> 01:26:45,334
What happened?

1275
01:26:51,522 --> 01:26:53,189
- A few months back,

1276
01:26:54,546 --> 01:26:57,611
I went to some dumb
party with these girls,

1277
01:26:57,611 --> 01:26:59,694
I wasn't even invited to.

1278
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,631
I didn't know anyone.

1279
01:27:02,631 --> 01:27:05,548
Music was pounding. Lots of people.

1280
01:27:06,825 --> 01:27:09,825
Guys. And one guy handed me a drink.

1281
01:27:11,063 --> 01:27:13,146
I remember feeling dizzy.

1282
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:19,460
And the guys, they were all staring at me.

1283
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:27,913
It took me a while to find a bathroom.

1284
01:27:27,913 --> 01:27:31,222
And I felt like they were following me.

1285
01:27:31,222 --> 01:27:32,722
I closed the door.

1286
01:27:36,478 --> 01:27:38,561
I didn't know what to do.

1287
01:27:40,082 --> 01:27:41,165
I called Ray.

1288
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:45,842
I was so afraid.

1289
01:27:49,756 --> 01:27:51,339
Nothing felt right.

1290
01:27:52,969 --> 01:27:56,386
I just remember he said, "Lock the door."

1291
01:27:58,354 --> 01:28:00,354
Everything was spinning.

1292
01:28:02,219 --> 01:28:03,719
And then the door,

1293
01:28:06,631 --> 01:28:09,729
someone was trying to get in.

1294
01:28:09,729 --> 01:28:12,312
And then they started pounding.

1295
01:28:15,736 --> 01:28:20,153
I heard them laughing outside,
telling me to open up.

1296
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:33,254
All I remember after that
was waking up in a bed

1297
01:28:33,254 --> 01:28:35,280
with an IV in my arm,

1298
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:39,506
and some old guy trying to give me a shot.

1299
01:28:39,506 --> 01:28:41,006
And Ray was there.

1300
01:28:42,392 --> 01:28:46,559
I made Ray promise to never
mention what happened.

1301
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,833
I was this close to getting raped.

1302
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:53,958
Shit happens, mother.

1303
01:28:55,834 --> 01:28:59,410
So every time you treat him so badly,

1304
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:02,295
you're stabbing my heart.

1305
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:03,962
Ray took care of me.

1306
01:29:06,333 --> 01:29:08,832
He takes care of everyone.

1307
01:29:08,832 --> 01:29:12,082
(gentle somber music)

1308
01:29:13,970 --> 01:29:15,220
- Oh. Oh, baby.

1309
01:29:16,283 --> 01:29:18,701
Come here, come here.

1310
01:29:18,701 --> 01:29:19,534
Okay.

1311
01:29:21,018 --> 01:29:24,677
- Oh Yasi, we didn't know,
honey, we didn't know.

1312
01:29:24,677 --> 01:29:26,021
- Now you do.

1313
01:29:26,021 --> 01:29:30,890
You still wanna fight him
over that stupid property?

1314
01:29:30,890 --> 01:29:34,074
- No honey, I'm so sorry,
I've been such a fool.

1315
01:29:34,074 --> 01:29:36,852
I'm so sorry. (crying)

1316
01:29:36,852 --> 01:29:37,935
I'm so sorry.

1317
01:29:45,115 --> 01:29:46,032
Sweetheart.

1318
01:29:49,267 --> 01:29:52,267
(slow somber music)

1319
01:29:54,338 --> 01:29:55,171
Ray.

1320
01:30:04,821 --> 01:30:07,488
My sister was lucky to have you.

1321
01:30:24,213 --> 01:30:27,213
(suspenseful music)

1322
01:30:52,926 --> 01:30:54,093
- [Vicki] Ray!

1323
01:30:57,884 --> 01:30:58,884
- You okay?

1324
01:31:03,587 --> 01:31:08,019
The documents are signed,
along with the deed.

1325
01:31:08,019 --> 01:31:08,852
- Attila.

1326
01:31:12,827 --> 01:31:14,082
(Gregor laughs)

1327
01:31:14,082 --> 01:31:16,011
(Gregor clapping)

1328
01:31:16,011 --> 01:31:16,844
Bravo.

1329
01:31:18,797 --> 01:31:19,964
Good job, Ray.

1330
01:31:20,897 --> 01:31:23,549
You did good, didn't
think you had it in ya.

1331
01:31:23,549 --> 01:31:26,804
We'll uh, we'll make
sure that it's all legit.

1332
01:31:26,804 --> 01:31:28,137
- It's all good.

1333
01:31:34,818 --> 01:31:38,089
- How much they paying you, Ray?

1334
01:31:38,089 --> 01:31:38,922
Huh?

1335
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:43,498
Probably just enough to
keep yourself in rent.

1336
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:45,350
You're driving around in
that secondhand shit box

1337
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:46,798
you call a car.

1338
01:31:46,798 --> 01:31:48,560
I can pay you a hell of a lot more money.

1339
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,810
I could use a guy like you.

1340
01:31:53,671 --> 01:31:55,254
- I know you could.

1341
01:31:56,285 --> 01:31:59,035
All I want is for her to be free.

1342
01:31:59,992 --> 01:32:01,992
- I want the same thing.

1343
01:32:03,374 --> 01:32:05,041
Just imagine, right?

1344
01:32:06,225 --> 01:32:08,374
I ask you to do a little something,

1345
01:32:08,374 --> 01:32:10,674
a little something here,
little something there.

1346
01:32:10,674 --> 01:32:14,238
Right? She can always be free as a bird.

1347
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:16,201
- What is it you want?

1348
01:32:16,201 --> 01:32:18,180
- You have a security company.

1349
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:20,509
I have a company needs security.

1350
01:32:20,509 --> 01:32:22,594
Mean, just having you
here, I feel safer already.

1351
01:32:22,594 --> 01:32:24,043
(Gregor laughs)

1352
01:32:24,043 --> 01:32:24,876
Oh, Vicki here, right?

1353
01:32:24,876 --> 01:32:28,704
She can go home, go home to
her mom, pursue her dreams.

1354
01:32:28,704 --> 01:32:30,744
Meet a nice boy, have a couple a kids.

1355
01:32:30,744 --> 01:32:33,413
I don't give a rat's ass.

1356
01:32:33,413 --> 01:32:35,663
But only if, you come back,

1357
01:32:38,567 --> 01:32:40,823
and we do a little bit of business.

1358
01:32:40,823 --> 01:32:42,073
You understand?

1359
01:32:46,693 --> 01:32:47,526
- I do.

1360
01:32:53,221 --> 01:32:55,754
- No, no, no, no, Ray.

1361
01:32:55,754 --> 01:32:57,754
She belongs in my world.

1362
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:07,477
(tense mysterious music)

1363
01:33:19,247 --> 01:33:22,414
(dog barks distantly)

1364
01:33:25,019 --> 01:33:27,852
(car alert beeps)

1365
01:33:38,407 --> 01:33:41,990
- (sighs) You're safe now.

1366
01:33:43,223 --> 01:33:46,115
Shawn will take care of you.

1367
01:33:46,115 --> 01:33:48,198
- Is it really over, Ray?

1368
01:33:50,581 --> 01:33:53,414
- You're going to be fine, Vicki.

1369
01:33:54,766 --> 01:33:57,659
- Why'd you give up your property for me?

1370
01:33:57,659 --> 01:33:59,810
- It wasn't for you.

1371
01:33:59,810 --> 01:34:01,680
- I don't understand.

1372
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:04,013
- I had to do it for myself.

1373
01:34:06,235 --> 01:34:08,485
- Am I gonna see you again?

1374
01:34:13,041 --> 01:34:14,458
- Goodbye, Vicki.

1375
01:34:16,147 --> 01:34:18,252
- I don't know how I'll
ever thank you enough.

1376
01:34:18,252 --> 01:34:19,752
You saved my life.

1377
01:34:20,802 --> 01:34:22,802
- No need, just be good.

1378
01:34:24,619 --> 01:34:25,619
- Thank you.

1379
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:29,296
From the bottom of my heart.

1380
01:34:29,296 --> 01:34:32,963
(gentle melancholic music)

1381
01:35:06,684 --> 01:35:08,962
Going back to them, aren't ya?

1382
01:35:08,962 --> 01:35:11,129
Please tell me you're not.

1383
01:35:12,066 --> 01:35:14,066
- I have to finish this.

1384
01:35:15,195 --> 01:35:17,112
- Why? I'm here, right?

1385
01:35:20,021 --> 01:35:21,590
Come with me.

1386
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:23,923
Come back to Canada with me.

1387
01:35:24,834 --> 01:35:25,786
- I can't.

1388
01:35:25,786 --> 01:35:29,686
- Sure you can. You can
do anything you want.

1389
01:35:29,686 --> 01:35:31,345
We can be together. We can start over.

1390
01:35:31,345 --> 01:35:34,074
You can have your own business.
I have money saved up.

1391
01:35:34,074 --> 01:35:35,235
We can be happy.

1392
01:35:35,235 --> 01:35:39,485
- Listen, Vicki. He'll
never stop coming after you.

1393
01:35:41,515 --> 01:35:42,348
Never.

1394
01:35:43,326 --> 01:35:46,493
(gentle somber music)

1395
01:35:52,286 --> 01:35:53,261
Goodbye, Vicki.

1396
01:35:53,261 --> 01:35:54,538
- No.

1397
01:35:54,538 --> 01:35:55,644
No.

1398
01:35:55,644 --> 01:35:57,336
No goodbyes.

1399
01:35:57,336 --> 01:36:00,503
(gentle somber music)

1400
01:36:17,432 --> 01:36:19,015
- Where's he going?

1401
01:36:21,519 --> 01:36:23,269
- Only he knows that.

1402
01:36:27,922 --> 01:36:30,672
That was the last time I saw him.

1403
01:36:31,546 --> 01:36:33,796
- All right, that's enough.

1404
01:36:34,782 --> 01:36:37,053
She's told all she knows.

1405
01:36:37,053 --> 01:36:39,527
- But the most important
question is yet to be answered.

1406
01:36:39,527 --> 01:36:41,668
- No more questions
until you tell us exactly

1407
01:36:41,668 --> 01:36:42,918
what went down.

1408
01:36:48,423 --> 01:36:51,750
(Steve sighs)

1409
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:52,704

Makes no sense.

1445
01:38:55,582 --> 01:38:56,415
- It does.

1446
01:38:57,499 --> 01:39:00,450

and this is very important.

1451
01:39:30,672 --> 01:39:32,839
Where do you think Ray is?

1452
01:39:34,839 --> 01:39:36,153
- What?

1453
01:39:36,153 --> 01:39:37,895
- What are you trying to say?

1454
01:39:37,895 --> 01:39:40,415
- It's a simple question.

1455
01:39:40,415 --> 01:39:42,570
Ray is a suspect in a
murder whose whereabouts

1456
01:39:42,570 --> 01:39:44,201
are currently unknown.

1457
01:39:44,201 --> 01:39:47,159
- What makes you think Ray
was even involved in this?

1458
01:39:47,159 --> 01:39:51,492
- We found his jacket,
bloodied, at the crime scene.

1459
01:39:53,901 --> 01:39:56,401
(Shawn sighs)

1460
01:39:57,474 --> 01:40:00,641
- Vicki, Ray may have saved your life,

1461
01:40:01,974 --> 01:40:06,974
but in so doing, he's gotten
his hands dirty in the process.

1462
01:40:08,536 --> 01:40:09,869
- Think! Please.

1463
01:40:14,296 --> 01:40:15,796
Where could he be?

1464
01:40:19,323 --> 01:40:21,156
- I really don't know.

1465
01:40:22,928 --> 01:40:26,928
But if you find him, it'll
only be on his terms.

1466
01:40:30,070 --> 01:40:30,903
His terms.
