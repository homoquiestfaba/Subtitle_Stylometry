1
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,193
Dear Mr. Stevens:

2
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,557
You will be surprised to hear
from me after all this time.

3
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,673
You've been in my thoughts since
I heard Lord Darlington had died.

4
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,390
We read that his heirs
put Darlington Hall up for sale...

5
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,949
...as they no longer wished
to maintain it.

6
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,789
As no one would buy
such a large house...

7
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,955
... the new earl decided to demolish
it and sell the stone for 5000 pounds.

8
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,195
We also saw some rubbish in the
Daily Mail which made my blood boil:

9
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,112
"Traitor's nest to be pulled down. "

10
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,551
One hundred and eighty guineas?

11
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,910
One hundred and eighty?
Have we done?

12
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,552
Ladies and gentlemen,
a great highlight of the sale:

13
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,151
Lot 414...

14
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,552
...the fine Elizabethan portrait,
A Portly Gentleman.

15
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,030
I'll start the bidding
at 2000 guineas.

16
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,158
2000 guineas, thank you.

17
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,349
2200.

18
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,788
2400.

19
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,393
2600.

20
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,959
2800.

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,758
3000. 3200.

22
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,837
3400. 3600.

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,395
3800.

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,394
4000 guineas.
Four and a half thousand.

25
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,595
5000.

26
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,348
And a half.

27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,879
6000.

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,235
And a half.

29
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,475
7000.

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,795
And a half.

31
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,553
8000.

32
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,875
And a half.

33
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,955
9'000.

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,354
And a half.

35
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,272
10,000 guineas is bid.

36
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,755
And a half.

37
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,749
11,000.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,989
And a half.

39
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,399
Against you, sir,
at eleven and a half thousand guineas.

40
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,993
All done at
eleven and a half thousand guineas.

41
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,789
I was very relieved to read
how an American millionaire...

42
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,951
...named Lewis saved
Darlington Hall...

43
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,993
...so you wouldn't be turned out
of your home after all.

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,356
Is it the same Congressman Lewis...

45
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,348
...who attended His Lordship's
conference in 1936?

46
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,793
Mr. Stevens, I so often think
of the good old days...

47
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,554
...when I was the housekeeper.

48
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,670
It was hard work...

49
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,311
...and I have known butlers easier
to please than our Mr. Stevens...

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,429
...but those years with you were
among the happiest of my life.

51
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,200
You must have a completely
different staff now.

52
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,590
Not many of the old faces
around anymore.

53
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,389
There's not much need
for the small army of footmen...

54
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,108
... that Lord Darlington employed.

55
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,554
My own news is not very cheerful.

56
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,588
In the 7 years since I last wrote,
I have again left my husband...

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,150
...and, sad to say,
my marriage seems to be over.

58
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,153
I'm staying at a friend's
boarding house in Clevedon.

59
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,875
I don't know what my future is.

60
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,716
Since Catherine, my daughter, got
married, my life has been empty.

61
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,754
The years stretch before me and
if only I knew how to fill them.

62
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,794
But I would like to be useful again.

63
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,118
-Burned again?
-Yes, I'm sorry, sir.

64
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,400
The rule in the kitchen
has always been...

65
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,350
...cook cooks the cooked breakfast
while her assistant toasts the toast.

66
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,994
Why don't we get her a pop-up toaster?

67
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,153
We need not a new gadget
but a revised staff plan, sir.

68
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,598
A staff plan, huh?
I didn't know we had one.

69
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,559
A faulty one, unfortunately.

70
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,839
Sir, quite recently...

71
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,992
...you were kind enough to suggest
that I go on a little holiday trip...

72
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,117
...around the country.

73
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,034
Absolutely. Certainly, take a break.
See the world.

74
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,229
Thank you, sir.

75
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,515
When did you last see the world?

76
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,799
The world always used to come
to this house, if I may say so.

77
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,394
You may say so.

78
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,189
Take off when I'm in London next week.

79
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,957
I tell you what, you take the car.

80
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,799
-Take the Daimler.
-Good Lord, sir, I couldn't.

81
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,395
You and that Daimler belong together.

82
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,232
You were made for each other.

83
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,671
That's most kind of you,
I must say, sir. Most kind.

84
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,991
I'd meant to travel the West, where l
understand we have splendid scenery.

85
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,597
And I might incidentally be able
to solve our problems while I'm there.

86
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,555
A former housekeeper, at present
living in Clevedon, has indicated...

87
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,354
...that she might be prepared
to return to service.

88
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,357
What's this, your girlfriend?

89
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,953
Or a former attachment?

90
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,993
Oh, no, sir.

91
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,593
No, but a very able housekeeper.

92
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,871
A most able housekeeper.

93
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,751
I was just kidding, Stevens.

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,830
Sorry.

95
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,759
You know what I like best
about your papers?

96
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,634
These obituaries.

97
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,953
Every son of a gun gets
this stately funeral oration.

98
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,197
-It's not an art we have in the States.
-lndeed, sir.

99
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,153
Thank you, Stevens.

100
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,755
Mr. Lewis.

101
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,639
Dear Mrs. Benn...

102
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,272
...I propose to reach Clevedon
on October 3rd around 4 p.m.

103
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,397
I'd be grateful for a line from you...

104
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,792
...to reach me at the post office
at Collingbourne, near Hungerford...

105
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,951
...where I'm planning to stop.

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,039
Mrs. Benn, I always said you
possess an amazing memory.

107
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,152
Our new employer is indeed
Congressman Lewis...

108
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,318
... though he's now retired
from political life in the U.S.

109
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,391
He's taken up residence at Darlington
Hall, soon to be joined by his family.

110
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,270
But I regret to say we are woefully
understaffed for a house this size.

111
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,599
Mrs. Benn, will you permit me
once again to sing your praises?

112
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,354
Let me state that when you left
to get married...

113
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,515
...no housekeeper ever reached
your high standard in any department.

114
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,358
I well remember your arrival
at Darlington Hall.

115
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,394
You came somewhat unexpectedly,
one might even say impulsively...

116
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,757
...while we were dead in the middle
of the Charlgrove meet.

117
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,952
That day is marked in my
memory in another way as well.

118
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,997
It was the last time His Lordship...

119
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,357
...was happy to welcome
his neighbours, as in the old days.

120
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,354
Of course, it had been years since
any of them had coaxed him to hunt.

121
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,030
It was never a sport His Lordship
enjoyed or approved of.

122
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,800
-Good morning, Ayres.
-My lord, nice to see you.

123
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,239
Excuse me, sir.

124
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,756
I fear I may have been a little
unwelcoming, even a little short.

125
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,798
You presented the best references
I've ever seen.

126
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,190
Which proved to be well-deserved.

127
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,149
Though, I confess, I did have my
doubts, on account of your youth.

128
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,790
No gentleman callers allowed,
of course.

129
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,596
Forgive my mentioning it, but we've
had those problems before.

130
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,478
Inside the house too.

131
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,474
The previous housekeeper ran off
with the under-butler.

132
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,436
If two staff members decide to get
married, one can say nothing.

133
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,750
What I find a major irritation...

134
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,829
...are those persons who go from
post to post looking for romance.

135
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,514
Housekeepers are particularly
guilty here.

136
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,189
-No offense intended, of course.
-None taken.

137
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,709
I know how a house is at sixes and
sevens once the staff start marrying.

138
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,234
Yes, indeed.

139
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,270
-Might I have a word, sir?
-Of course.

140
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,359
My lord, it's regarding
the under-butler...

141
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,716
...and the housekeeper
who ran off last month.

142
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,111
Bad business.
How are you managing?

143
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,755
I've found two
first-rate replacements.

144
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,679
Miss Kenton, a young woman
with excellent references.

145
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,593
Very pleasing demeanour.
Appears to be very able.

146
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,990
And a man with
considerable experience.

147
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,957
-Older and happy to be under-butler.
-Name?

148
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,996
Stevens, sir.

149
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,992
-Stevens?
-Yes, sir.

150
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,674
-That's your name.
-He's my father, sir.

151
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,554
Really?

152
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,754
Couldn't do better.
I'd like to see him sometime.

153
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,075
He's outside the door.

154
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,032
Good. Bring him in.

155
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,633
Thank you, my lord.

156
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,436
Father.

157
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,151
Mr. Stevens, how do you do?

158
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,828
-My lord.
-Very good man here, your son.

159
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,868
He serves the house well.
I don't know what we'd do without him.

160
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,270
-Proud of him?
-Very, my lord.

161
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,959
Quite right too.

162
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,999
Glad to have you with us.

163
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,355
Thank you, my lord.

164
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,633
What are we at dinner tonight?
14? 16?

165
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,909
Twelve, sir.

166
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,916
Right.

167
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,435
Thank you, my lord.

168
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,152
-This pitcher seems out of place here.
-Dining room. Well spotted.

169
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,151
-Hello, William, how are you?
-Good day, Miss Kenton.

170
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,993
I thought these might
brighten your parlour.

171
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,389
Beg your pardon?

172
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,675
They might cheer things up for you.

173
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,592
That's very kind of you.

174
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,959
If you like, I could bring in
some more for you.

175
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,474
Thank you...

176
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,550
...but I regard this room
as my private place of work...

177
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,593
...and I prefer to keep distractions
to a minimum.

178
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,559
Would you call flowers
a distraction, then?

179
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,070
I appreciate your kindness.
I prefer to keep things as they are.

180
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,677
But since you are here, there is a
small matter I wanted to mention.

181
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,356
I happened to be walking past
the kitchen yesterday morning...

182
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,160
...and I heard you call
to someone named William.

183
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,557
May I ask who you were
addressing by that name?

184
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,513
I should think I was
addressing your father.

185
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,595
There are no other Williams
in this house.

186
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,670
True.

187
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,310
May I ask you in future to address
my father as Mr. Stevens?

188
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,797
If speaking of him
to a third party, you may call him...

189
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,474
...Mr. Stevens Sr.
to distinguish him from myself.

190
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,349
So I would be most grateful to you,
Miss Kenton.

191
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,990
I don't quite understand
what you're getting at.

192
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,991
I am the housekeeper in this house,
and your father is the under-butler.

193
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,472
I am accustomed to addressing under-
servants by their Christian names.

194
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,788
If you would stop to think for a moment,
you'd realize...

195
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,874
...how inappropriate it is for one such
as yourself to address as William...

196
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,350
...someone such as my father.

197
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,556
It must have been very galling for
your father to be called William...

198
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,756
...by one such as myself.

199
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,190
My father is a person from whom...

200
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,477
...if you'd observe him more,
you may learn things.

201
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,274
I'm grateful for your advice,
but do tell me...

202
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,511
...what things might I learn from him?

203
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,796
I might point out that you're...

204
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,634
...often unsure of what goes where
and which item is which.

205
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,991
I'm sure Mr. Stevens Sr.
is very good at his job...

206
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,557
...but I can assure you
that I'm very good at mine.

207
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,829
-Of course.
-Thank you.

208
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,957
If you will please excuse me.

209
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,350
Oh, well.

210
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,351
My compliments to cook.

211
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,631
What a lovely piece of crackling.

212
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,115
I'm sure you said something witty.
Share it with the rest of us.

213
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,758
I said the sprouts is done the way
I like them. Crisp-like, not mushy.

214
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,076
Sprouts "are" done, not "is" done.

215
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,675
Isn't that right, George?

216
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,875
Yes, Mr. Stevens.

217
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,749
Forgive the correction,
as I would have done...

218
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,554
...at your age for the sake
of my education.

219
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,038
I'm sure even you have ambitions
to rise in your profession.

220
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,994
Oh, yes. I want to be
a butler, to be called Mister...

221
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,028
...sit in my own pantry by my own fire,
smoking my cigar.

222
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,556
I wonder if you realize what it takes
to be a great butler?

223
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,109
Takes dignity, that's what it takes.

224
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,354
Thank you, Mr. Stevens.
Dignity, that's right. Dignity.

225
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,876
The definition from our quarterly
The Gentlemen's Gentleman:.

226
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,475
A great butler must be possessed
of dignity--

227
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,756
In keeping with his position.

228
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,792
There was this English butler
in lndia.

229
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,111
One day, he goes in the dining room
and what's under the table?

230
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,275
A tiger.

231
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,796
Not turning a hair,
he goes to the drawing room.

232
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,917
"Excuse me, my lord," and whispering,
so as not to upset the ladies:

233
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,871
"I'm sorry. There appears to
be a tiger in the dining room.

234
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,399
Perhaps His Lordship will permit
use of the twelve-bores?"

235
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,351
They go on drinking their tea.
And then, there's three gunshots.

236
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,152
They don't think nothing of it.
In lndia, they're used to anything.

237
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,991
When the butler is back
to refresh the teapots...

238
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,630
...he says, cool as a cucumber:

239
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,037
"Dinner will be served
at the usual time, my lord.

240
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,473
And I am pleased to say there will
be no discernible traces left...

241
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,951
...of the recent occurrence
by that time."

242
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,555
I'll repeat it. "There will be
no discernible traces left...

243
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,435
...of the recent occurrence
by that time."

244
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,274
-Wonderful, Mr. Stevens.
-Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

245
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,116
Wonderful story. That's the ideal
that we should all aim for. Dignity.

246
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,155
For you, Mr. Stevens.

247
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,716
Thank you.

248
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,434
It's for Mr. Stevens Sr.,
Mr. Stevens.

249
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,837
Thank you, Miss Kenton.

250
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,957
Put Mr. Stevens Sr.'s plate
with cook to keep it warm.

251
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,309
Yes, Miss Kenton.

252
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,950
Thank you.

253
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,952
Not at all, Mr. Stevens.

254
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,396
If you're searching for your dustpan,
it is out on the landing.

255
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,595
My dustpan?

256
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,149
You've left it on the landing.

257
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,279
-I haven't used a dustpan.
-Really? It must be somebody else.

258
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,671
-I don't follow you.
-My mistake, no doubt. One of many.

259
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,269
Morning, sir.

260
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,597
I've invited Giscard Dupont D'lvry
as the French delegate.

261
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,353
He'll never come!

262
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,074
I just had word of his acceptance.

263
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,155
Dupont is fanatically anti-German.
His speech in Geneva in '33...

264
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,999
...made me ashamed to be
an ally of the French.

265
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,832
It's not the English way.

266
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,029
No, it is not.

267
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,558
This is the purpose of our conference,
to discuss these matters informally...

268
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,678
...far from the to-do
of an international conference...

269
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,036
...in the friendly and relaxed...

270
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,150
...atmosphere of one's home.

271
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,079
We may bring round the French
to our point of view.

272
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,197
And that of the Germans.

273
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,672
I'm sorry to interrupt, but how can we
associate with the Germans?

274
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,799
With the Nazi Party! They have torn
up and trampled every treaty...

275
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,352
...and are a growing threat to Europe,
not to mention a brutal dictatorship.

276
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,555
My dear boy, when I was in Berlin,
I saw at last a happy German people...

277
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,158
...with jobs, bread, pride in their
country and love of their leader.

278
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,231
And what about the Jews?

279
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,194
Did His Lordship wish to exchange
the Chinaman in the cabinet room...

280
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,158
...with the one outside the door?

281
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,033
-Chinaman?
-Yes.

282
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,438
The Chinaman from the cabinet room is
outside this door. See for yourself.

283
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,598
I'm busy at the moment.

284
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,676
Just pop your head outside this door
and see for yourself.

285
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,754
-I'll look into the matter later.
-You think it's a fantasy?

286
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,714
A fantasy on my part
due to my inexperience?

287
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,356
I'm busy in this room, Miss Kenton.

288
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,754
I shall wait.

289
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,915
Outside.

290
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,996
Look!

291
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,993
-ls that not the wrong Chinaman?
-I am very busy.

292
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,470
Have you nothing better to do
than stand around?

293
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,756
Look at it and tell me the truth.

294
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,992
Keep your voice down.
What would the other servants think...

295
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,390
...of us shouting about a Chinaman?

296
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,358
And I would ask you...

297
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,149
...to turn around
and look at the Chinaman.

298
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,278
It is a small mistake.

299
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,751
Your father is entrusted with more
than he can cope with.

300
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,234
Let me pass.

301
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,193
Your father left the dustpan
on the floor.

302
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,193
He left polish on the cutlery
and confused the Chinaman.

303
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,795
Recognize this before he commits
a major error!

304
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,555
-You can't talk to me like this.
-I'm afraid I must.

305
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,070
I'm giving you serious advice.

306
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,479
Your father should be relieved of a
number of his duties for his own good.

307
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,878
Whatever he once was, he no longer
has the same ability or strength.

308
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,995
I thank you for your advice.

309
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,151
Perhaps now I can go about
my business.

310
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,914
I never meant to keep you
from your business.

311
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,669
Thank you.

312
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,030
It's vital that we've agreed a common
policy before the arrival of...

313
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,355
-...your Frenchman. What's his name?
-Giscard Dupont D'lvry.

314
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,870
We also expect the
American delegate...

315
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,953
...Congressman Lewis,
to arrive on the same day.

316
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,958
Who is he, this American?

317
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,116
He's an unknown quantity. A young
congressman from Pennsylvania.

318
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,630
Sits on some sort of powerful
Foreign Affairs Committee.

319
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,190
Heir to one of those
American fortunes.

320
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,396
-Meatpacking?
-Trolley cars?

321
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,232
Or dry goods?

322
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,357
What are dry goods?

323
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,154
Something that Americans make
a lot of money in.

324
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,678
No, I think Mr. Lewis' fortune
comes from cosmetics, actually.

325
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,359
It's old Mr. Stevens!

326
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,990
Get a cushion, quickly.
A blanket!

327
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,590
The silver!
The silver!

328
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,831
Oh, my lord. Sorry.

329
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,833
You'll be all right.

330
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,473
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry.
What happened?

331
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,473
-He tripped with the tray.
-I saw it from the window.

332
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,676
This has never happened before.

333
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,639
-May I telephone the doctor?
-Yes, do.

334
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,117
-I'm sorry.
-Don't worry.

335
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,797
Your father feeling better?

336
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,758
He's made a full recovery.

337
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,393
Good.

338
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,479
We don't wish to see anything
of that sort ever happen again, do we?

339
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,792
-I mean, your father collapsing.
-lndeed not, my lord.

340
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,156
And it could happen anywhere.

341
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,239
At any time.

342
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,279
The first of the foreign delegates
will be here in less than a fortnight.

343
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,478
-We are well prepared, my lord.
-I'm sure you are.

344
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,473
What happens within this house
could have...

345
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,792
...considerable repercussions
on the course that Europe takes.

346
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,158
It means a great deal.

347
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,432
And it means a great deal
to me personally.

348
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,992
I had a German friend,
Karl-Heinz Bremann.

349
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,879
We fought on opposite sides
in the war.

350
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,795
We always said when it was over,
we'd sit down and have a drink...

351
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,314
...Iike gentlemen.

352
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,588
The Versailles Treaty
made a liar of me.

353
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,914
Yes, a liar, Stevens.

354
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,312
Because the terms we imposed were
so harsh that Germany was finished.

355
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,997
One doesn't do that
to a defeated foe.

356
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,391
Once your man's on the canvas,
it ought to be over.

357
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,869
My friend Bremann
was ruined by inflation.

358
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,238
Couldn't get a job
in postwar Germany.

359
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,394
Killed himself.

360
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,235
Shot himself in a railway carriage.

361
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,398
Since then, I've felt it my duty
to help Germany and to give her...

362
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,993
...a fair chance.

363
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,156
So this conference is crucial...

364
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,790
...and we can't run the risk
of any accidents.

365
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,110
There's no question
of your father leaving.

366
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,195
You're simply being asked
to reconsider his duties.

367
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,159
Of course, my lord.
I understand fully.

368
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,429
Good.

369
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,073
I'll leave you to think about it,
then, Stevens.

370
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,309
Thank you, sir.

371
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,277
I'm short-handed in the dining room.
I can use you in the servery.

372
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,876
-Thank you, Mr. Stevens, sir.
-Smarten up. Look sharp.

373
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,716
Good morning.

374
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,235
Good morning.

375
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,358
I might've known you'd be up
and ready for the day.

376
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,670
I've been up for two hours.

377
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,955
-That's not much sleep.
-It's all the sleep I need.

378
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,355
I've come to talk to you.

379
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,637
Talk, then.
I haven't got all morning.

380
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,150
-I'll come straight to the point.
-Do, and be done with it.

381
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,749
Some of us have work
to be getting on with.

382
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,596
There's to be a very important
conference in this house next week.

383
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,236
People of great stature will be
His Lordship's guests.

384
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,949
We must all put our best foot forward.

385
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,193
Because of Father's recent accident...

386
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,069
...it has been suggested that you
no longer wait at table.

387
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,517
I've waited at table every day...

388
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,320
...for the last 54 years.

389
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,995
It has also been decided that you
should no longer carry heavy trays.

390
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,952
Now, here's a revised list
of your duties.

391
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,673
Look, I fell...

392
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,878
...because of those paving stones.

393
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,155
They're crooked.

394
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,750
Why don't you get them put right
before someone else falls?

395
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,395
You will read the revised list
of your duties.

396
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,949
Get those stones put right.

397
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,635
You don't want those "gentlemen of
stature" breaking their necks.

398
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,871
No, indeed, I don't.

399
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,789
What is it?

400
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,238
You have what we can call
a roving commission.

401
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,916
In other words, you can exercise
your own judgment...

402
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,196
...within certain limits, of course.

403
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,995
Now, here are the mops, and....
Here.

404
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,794
-Are these me mops?
-Right. Your brushes.

405
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,473
And me brushes?

406
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,075
-And me mops.
-That's right.

407
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,796
What do you want me to do with them?

408
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,592
I think you know what to do with them,
Father. Look for dust and dirt.

409
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,840
If I find any dust or dirt...

410
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,389
...I go over them with this mop.

411
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,834
That's right.

412
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,799
Now, I suggest you start off...

413
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,190
...with the brasses on the doors.

414
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,113
There's that door there.
Then the door that's open.

415
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,396
And then there's this door here....

416
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,710
Here's your polish.
And duster.

417
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,475
History could well be made under
this roof over the next few days.

418
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,511
Each and every one of you...

419
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,719
...can be proud of the role
you will play on this occasion.

420
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,838
Imagine yourself
the head of a battalion...

421
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,913
...even if it is only filling
the hot-water bottles.

422
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,634
Each one has his own
particular duty...

423
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,713
...or her particular duty,
as the cap fits.

424
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,078
Polished brass, brilliant silver,
mahogany shining like a mirror.

425
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,917
That is the welcome we will show
these foreign visitors...

426
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,230
... to let them know
they are in England...

427
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,075
...where order and tradition
still prevail.

428
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,794
Thank you, Brian.

429
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,190
Mr. Lewis, the American,
has arrived.

430
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,273
He was expected tomorrow.
What have you done with him?

431
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,235
Mr. Lewis has been shown upstairs.

432
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,795
My godson, Cardinal, will shortly
become engaged to be married.

433
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,594
Indeed, sir.
I offer my congratulations.

434
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,239
Thank you, Stevens.

435
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,837
I feel very responsible for the boy.

436
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,312
He is my godson, and his father
was my closest friend, as you know.

437
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,790
And now that he's gone, well...

438
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,834
...I feel in place of a father to him.

439
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,993
I've appointed him as my secretary
at the conference.

440
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,476
He's been jolly thorough
in helping me to prepare.

441
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,791
I realize this is a somewhat
irregular thing to ask you to do.

442
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,430
I'd be glad to be of any assistance.

443
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,398
I'm sorry to bring this up...

444
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,275
...but I just can't see how on earth
to make it go away.

445
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,514
You are familiar with
the facts of life?

446
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,110
-My lord?
-The facts of life.

447
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,999
Birds, bees.
You are familiar, aren't you?

448
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,712
I'm afraid I don't quite follow you.

449
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,394
Let me put my cards on the table.

450
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,036
I'm so busy with this conference.
Of course, you are too...

451
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,074
...but someone has to tell him.

452
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,709
In a way, it would be easier for you.

453
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,959
Less awkward.

454
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,033
I'd find the task rather daunting,
I'm afraid.

455
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,670
I might not get to it
before Reginald's wedding day.

456
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,396
Of course, this goes far beyond
the call of duty.

457
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,229
I shall do my best.

458
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,517
I'd be grateful if you'd try.
It'd be a lot off my mind.

459
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,278
There's no need to make a song and
dance of it. Just convey the facts.

460
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,633
God! Stevens!

461
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,713
Sorry. Most sorry, sir...

462
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,191
...but I do have something to convey
to you rather urgently.

463
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,000
If I may, I'll come to the point.

464
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,990
Perhaps you noticed this morning the
ducks and the geese by the pond?

465
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,231
Ducks and geese?
I don't think so.

466
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,592
Well, perhaps the birds
and the flowers, then...

467
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,035
...or the shrubs, the bees....

468
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,475
I've not seen any bees.

469
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,639
-It's not the best time to see them.
-What, the bees?

470
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,115
What I'm saying is that,
with the arrival of spring...

471
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,194
...we shall see a most remarkable
and profound change...

472
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,714
...in the surroundings.

473
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,033
I'm sure that's right. I'm sure the
grounds are not at their best now.

474
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,238
I wasn't paying attention
to the glories of nature...

475
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,596
...because it's worrying....

476
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,719
Dupont D'lvry has arrived in a foul
mood, the last thing anyone wants.

477
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,033
-M. Dupont D'lvry has arrived?
-Half an hour ago, in a foul mood.

478
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,592
In that case, excuse me.
I'd better go and attend to him.

479
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,274
Right you are.
Kind of you to talk to me.

480
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,718
Not at all. I've one or two words
more to convey on the topic of...

481
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,190
...as you put it most admirably...

482
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,628
...the glories of nature.

483
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,235
But it must wait for another occasion.

484
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,392
I'll look forward to it.
But I'm more of a fish man.

485
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,392
-Fish?
-I know all about fish.

486
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,999
Freshwater and salt.

487
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,396
All living creatures would be
relevant to our discussion.

488
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,599
Excuse me. I had no idea that
Monsieur Dupont D'lvry had arrived.

489
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,875
Thank you.

490
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,677
May I be of assistance, sir?

491
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,633
Oh, the butler.

492
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,950
I have sore feet, so I need a basin
with warm water and salts, please.

493
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,993
I'll arrange that with
the housekeeper, sir.

494
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,997
Warm water and salts
as soon as possible.

495
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,996
How do you do? But I speak English.

496
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,432
Good. That's lucky for me.
I'm Jack Lewis, the U.S. delegate.

497
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,671
Could we speak privately soon?

498
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,995
Yes, of course.

499
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,955
But I have blisters due to some
sightseeing they made me do in London.

500
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,350
I had already seen
the Tower of London.

501
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,031
I've discovered that things
are not moving...

502
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,431
...in a direction that I think
you would approve of.

503
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,237
German rearmament
is a fact to be accepted.

504
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,711
It's in our own interest to have a free
and equal Germany.

505
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,598
Not a prostrate nation...

506
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,395
...upon whom an unfair peace treaty
was imposed 16 years ago.

507
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,397
Those who've been in Germany...

508
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,390
...can only thrill, as I have,
to the signs of rebirth.

509
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,833
--to assist Germany in her virile
struggle for economic recovery...

510
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,437
...including support for her fair
demand for equality of armaments...

511
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,672
...and universal military service
for German youth.

512
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,597
If we, in postwar Europe....

513
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,436
I need more water.
I need another basin to bathe my feet.

514
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,556
Follow me, sir.

515
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,035
Excuse me.

516
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,557
-We have to talk.
-This way, sir.

517
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,829
My friend, I am in agony.
Too tight shoes. I blame myself.

518
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,479
Vanity.

519
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,919
We must do some fast maneuvering
to restrain the Germans.

520
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,071
Please come this way, gentlemen.

521
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,434
Butler, please, could you help me
with my feet-- shoe?

522
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,636
-Yes, of course.
-Take it off.

523
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,635
What they said about equality of arms
for Germany, military service--

524
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,757
-Sorry, sir.
-I'll manage.

525
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,756
What?

526
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,594
Your father's been taken ill, sir.

527
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,031
-Where?
-Outside the Chinese bedroom, sir.

528
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,637
Germany wants peace as much as we do.
She needs peace.

529
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,916
Here, let me help you with that.

530
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,595
Thank you.

531
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,679
Thank you, Charles.

532
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,430
Take a basin of hot water and salts...

533
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,036
...to Mr. D'lvry in the
billiards room. Is that understood?

534
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,396
-Yes, Mr. Stevens.
-Good. Do it.

535
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,389
Father?

536
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,428
I have more time than you to look
after him. I've called the doctor.

537
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,999
Thank you, Miss Kenton.

538
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,996
Your father's not so good, I'm afraid.

539
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,438
If he deteriorates, call me, will you?

540
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,193
How old is he? 70, 72?

541
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,192
-75, sir.
-I see.

542
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,634
-lf he deteriorates, let me know.
-I will, sir. Thank you, doctor.

543
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,590
More haste, less speed.

544
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,510
There's something missing.

545
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,236
What is it?

546
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,119
-The spoon from the cruet set, sir.
-Good.

547
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,395
Well observed.

548
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,311
Now, never touch the lip of the glass.

549
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,356
Good.

550
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,158
Glass first, and then....

551
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,309
Is everything in hand downstairs?

552
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,872
We're preparing the last dinner
of the conference.

553
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,591
You can imagine the kitchen.

554
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,072
-But is everything in hand?
-Yes, I think we're up to scratch.

555
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,709
Are you feeling any better?

556
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,910
There's something I have to tell you.

557
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,316
I have so much to do.
Why don't we talk in the morning?

558
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,515
Jim...

559
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,555
...I fell out of love
with your mother.

560
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,232
I loved her once.

561
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,676
The love went out of me
when I found her carrying on.

562
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,478
A good son.

563
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,358
Proud of you.

564
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,390
I hope I've been a good father.

565
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,231
I tried me best.

566
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,675
You better get down there...

567
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,632
...or heaven only knows
what they'll be up to.

568
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,588
Go on.

569
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,349
Go on!

570
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,671
We'll talk in the morning.

571
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,913
On the last day of our conference...

572
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,835
...permit me to say
how impressed I have been...

573
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,995
...with the spirit of goodwill
that has prevailed.

574
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,710
Goodwill for Germany.

575
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,996
And with tears in my eyes...

576
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,078
...I see that everyone here
has recognized...

577
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,717
...our right to be, once again,
a strong nation.

578
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,274
With my hand on my heart,
I declare...

579
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,551
...that Germany needs peace...

580
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,395
...and desires only peace.

581
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,674
Peace with England...

582
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,110
...and peace with France.

583
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,393
Thank you very much.

584
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,797
I, too, have been impressed...

585
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,589
...yes, deeply impressed...

586
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:19,152
...by the genuine desire for peace
manifested at this conference.

587
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,510
Unlike our American colleague...

588
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,752
...we in Europe know
the horrors of war.

589
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,149
And whether we are French
or English or ltalian or German...

590
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,393
...our one desire is to never
have to experience them again.

591
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,030
Indeed.

592
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,033
Impressed, or I may say touched...

593
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,829
...by the words of goodwill
and friendship I have heard...

594
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,477
...I promise you that I shall do
my utmost...

595
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,915
...to change my country's policy...

596
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,594
...towards that nation
which was once our foe...

597
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,229
...but is now,
I may venture to say...

598
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,390
...our friend.

599
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,033
Ladies and gentlemen...

600
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,155
...the United States doesn't want war
any more than you do.

601
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,031
On the other hand, neither do we
want peace at any price...

602
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,840
...because some prices,
you may find...

603
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,640
...are too outrageously high to pay.

604
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,316
But let's not get into that now.
We may have to soon enough.

605
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,189
For the moment, let us raise
our glasses to Lord Darlington...

606
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,238
...in gratitude for his
magnificent hospitality.

607
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,958
Lord Darlington is a classic
English gentleman of the old school.

608
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,309
Decent and honorable and well-meaning.

609
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,394
So are all of you. All decent,
honorable and well-meaning gentlemen.

610
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,076
It's a pleasure and a privilege
to visit with you here.

611
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,556
But...

612
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,236
...now, excuse me, I must say this...

613
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,238
...you are, all of you, amateurs.

614
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,478
And international affairs should
never be run by gentlemen amateurs.

615
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,077
Do you have any idea of what sort
of a place the world is becoming?

616
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,110
The days when you could act
out of noble instincts are over.

617
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,638
Europe has become the arena of
Realpolitik, the politics of reality.

618
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,952
If you like, real politics.

619
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,718
What you need is not gentlemen
politicians, but real ones.

620
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,589
You need professionals,
or you're headed for disaster.

621
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,635
So I propose a toast, gentlemen...

622
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,558
...to the professionals.

623
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,590
Well, I've no wish to enter
into a quarrel...

624
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,597
...on our last evening together.

625
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,992
But let me say this.
What you describe as amateurism...

626
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:15,028
...is what I think most of us here
still prefer to call honour.

627
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,469
Miss Kenton would like to see you
concerning your father.

628
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,235
I suggest that your professionalism
means greed and power...

629
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,555
...rather than to see justice
and goodness prevail in the world.

630
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,239
I've never concealed from myself
that what we were asking of Germany...

631
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,837
...is a complete break from the
tradition of this country. Thank you.

632
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,756
Mr. Stevens, I'm very sorry.

633
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,272
Your father passed away
four minutes ago.

634
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,233
Oh, I see.

635
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,878
I'm so very sorry.

636
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,748
I wish there was something
I could say.

637
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,911
Will you come up and see him?

638
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:11,119
Well, I'm very busy at the moment.
In a little while, perhaps.

639
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,430
In that case, will you permit me
to close his eyes?

640
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,433
I would be most grateful.
Thank you.

641
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,631
My father would wish me to carry on.
I can't let him down.

642
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,671
No. Of course.

643
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,392
I'd really like to continue
our little chat sometime.

644
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,199
About nature.

645
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,309
You're right. I should come back
when everything's burgeoning.

646
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,959
Yes, sir. Indeed.

647
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,028
As I said before, my main interest
has always been in fish.

648
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,034
When I was small,
I kept tropical fish in a tank.

649
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,430
I harboured quite a passion for them.

650
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,589
I'll have another drop of that,
if you don't mind.

651
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,908
You all right?

652
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,113
I'm perfectly all right.

653
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,918
Not feeling unwell?

654
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,515
No, sir. A little tired, perhaps.

655
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,754
Wonderful!

656
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,238
What a beautiful example of German
culture you've brought to this house.

657
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,155
Very nice.

658
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,711
I hope there's no hard feelings.

659
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,518
Oh, my dear good chap.

660
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,833
I like a good, clean fight.
Giving as good as one gets, what?

661
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,436
I have the greatest respect
for the English. I love it here.

662
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,990
My family brought us here as kids,
so I feel at home.

663
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,389
Anyway, thank you.

664
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,949
Excuse me.

665
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,913
You all right?

666
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,359
Yes, perfect, my lord.

667
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,994
You coming down
with a cold or something?

668
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,588
It's been a long day.

669
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,758
It's been a hard day for both of us.

670
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,393
Well done.

671
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,758
My condolences.

672
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:56,035
It was a stroke. A severe stroke.
He wouldn't have suffered much pain.

673
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,038
Thank you for telling me.

674
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,996
There's a distinguished foreign
gentleman in the billiard room...

675
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,389
...in need of attention.

676
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,595
Urgent?

677
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,159
His feet.

678
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,675
Feet?

679
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,512
-I'll take you to him.
-lf it's urgent.

680
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,959
It is urgent.
The gentleman is in pain.

681
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,199
My condolences.

682
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,954
Thank you. That is most kind of you.

683
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,069
Good afternoon.

684
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,551
My name is Stevens.
I'm hoping there's a letter for me.

685
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,158
-I'll just check for you, sir.
-James Stevens.

686
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,351
-I'd like two apples, please.
-There you are, Mr. Stevens.

687
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,470
-You are touring in these parts?
-I'm on my way to Clevedon.

688
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,871
-How much is that?
-That'll be threepence, please.

689
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,076
And you'd be coming from...?

690
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,958
-Oxfordshire.
-Whereabouts?

691
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,113
-Sorry?
-Whereabouts in Oxfordshire?

692
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,196
Darlington.

693
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:53,075
That rings a bell. Wasn't there
a Lord Darlington? Some sort...

694
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,117
...of Nazi, got us in the war?

695
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,749
I'm the butler there,
and my employer...

696
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,110
...is Mr. Lewis, an American gentleman.

697
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,431
I didn't know the former owner.

698
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,829
Your change.

699
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,991
I should be glad to meet you at the
Sea View Hotel, opposite the pier.

700
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:36,358
We'll have such a lot to talk about,
and I'll have many questions.

701
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,559
Except for you, I've lost touch with
all our friends at Darlington Hall.

702
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,795
But that's no wonder.

703
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,555
It was long ago and a lot
has happened in between.

704
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:49,999
Who could keep track of all the people
His Lordship once employed?

705
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,559
My lord, you rang?

706
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,196
-Have the young German ladies arrived?
-They're outside.

707
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,273
I'd like to say hello to them,
practise my German.

708
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:02,593
-They do speak excellent English.
-Good. Well, ask them to come in.

709
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,470
This is Elsa and this is lrma.

710
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,912
I'm asking about their journey.

711
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,398
It was long, my lord.

712
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,358
I asked if they like the weather.

713
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:36,439
We are grateful to you, my lord,
for letting us come here.

714
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,156
Our parents are very grateful.

715
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,272
Not at all.
Miss Kenton will look after you.

716
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,192
-Won't you?
-lndeed, my lord.

717
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,589
Welcome to Darlington Hall.

718
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,229
-Thank you, my lord.
-Thank you, my lord.

719
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,032
Will there be anything else?

720
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,795
Sir Geoffrey.

721
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,674
Good to see you.

722
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,668
How do you do?

723
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,554
Well, come in.

724
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,392
-Mr. Benn.
-Mr. Stevens.

725
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,313
Gentlemen, if you'd like to wait
here for a while.

726
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:45,553
-Aren't you still at Stanton Lacey?
-I'm with Sir Geoffrey now.

727
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,194
-You haven't changed one bit.
-I'll let you get on.

728
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,954
-Perhaps we'll meet later.
-I hope so.

729
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,676
But, gentlemen, you speak of Jews
and Gypsies, Negroes and so forth.

730
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,869
But one has to regard the racial
laws of the Fascists...

731
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,476
...as a sanitary measure,
much overdue, in my opinion.

732
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,757
Imagine trying to enforce
such a rule in this country--

733
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,077
You cannot run a country
without a penal system.

734
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:17,757
Here we call them prisons. There,
they call them concentration camps.

735
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,349
Is there any meat
of any kind in this soup?

736
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,591
I think it's mushroom stock, sir.

737
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:27,594
Mushroom ends and skins,
onion and celery. No meat at all.

738
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,593
Cold water, and then cook adds sherry.

739
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,669
I hear you have a Labour fellow
from your constituency.

740
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:38,799
Over there, they've got rid of
all that trade union rubbish.

741
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,589
Believe me, no workers strike
in Germany.

742
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,876
And everyone's kept in line.

743
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,998
No wonder this country
is going down the drain.

744
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,356
It is internally diseased.

745
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,672
I think there may be butter
in the croutons. Do you know?

746
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,990
I'm afraid there may be.

747
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,795
You've made a cozy little nest here.

748
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,634
Seems to me you must be
a well-contented man.

749
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,396
In my philosophy, Mr. Benn...

750
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,154
...a man cannot call himself
well-contented...

751
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,391
...until he has done all he can...

752
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,790
...to be of service to his employer.

753
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,156
This assumes that one's employer...

754
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,393
...is a superior person
not only in rank or wealth...

755
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,153
...but in moral stature.

756
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,949
And in your opinion, what's going on
up there has "moral stature"?

757
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,031
I wish I could be sure.

758
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,789
But I'm not.

759
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,952
I've heard some very fishy things.
Very fishy.

760
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,276
I hear nothing.

761
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,316
Listen.

762
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,596
That's so touching, isn't it?

763
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:00,115
To listen to the gentlemen
would distract me from my work.

764
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,433
It's fresh soda.

765
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,153
Would you be joining us?

766
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,154
Thank you, but it's very late
and I have an early start.

767
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,588
Good night.

768
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,832
-Good night, Mr. Stevens.
-Good night, Miss Kenton.

769
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,753
Good-looking woman.

770
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:38,072
It was never the same
after she left Stanton Lacey.

771
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,959
I handed in my own notice
six months later.

772
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,951
I'd be lost without her.

773
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:51,077
A first-rate housekeeper
is essential in a house like this...

774
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:54,949
...where great affairs are decided
between these walls.

775
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,471
-Good morning.
-My lord.

776
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:22,952
"We do the Jews no injustice when we
say that the revelation of Christ...

777
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,755
...is something incomprehensible
and hateful to them.

778
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,394
Though He apparently sprang
from their midst...

779
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:33,076
...He embodies the negation of their
whole nature.

780
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,790
The Jews are far more sensitive
about this than we are.

781
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:41,795
This demonstration of the cleft that
separates us Europeans from the Jew...

782
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,998
...is not given in order
to let religious prejudice...

783
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,754
...with its dangerous bias,
settle the matter...

784
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,549
...but because the perception of
two fundamentally different natures...

785
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,836
...reveals a real gulf. "

786
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:15,591
We have some refugee girls
on the staff now, I believe.

787
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,989
We do.

788
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,549
Two housemaids, Elsa and lrma.

789
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,550
You'll have to let them go,
I'm afraid.

790
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,153
Let them go, my lord?

791
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:31,552
It's regrettable,
but we have no choice.

792
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,395
You must see the whole thing
in context.

793
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,712
I have the well-being
of my guests to consider.

794
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,593
May I say...

795
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,671
...they work extremely well.

796
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,673
They're intelligent, polite
and very clean.

797
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,674
I'm sorry, but I've looked
into this matter very carefully.

798
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,229
There are larger issues at stake.

799
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,591
I'm sorry, but there it is.

800
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,710
They're Jews.

801
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:06,995
Yes, my lord.

802
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,395
I'm amazed you can stand
there as if...

803
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,349
...you were discussing orders
for the larder. I can't believe it!
