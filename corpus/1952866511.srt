1
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,040
Yeah, 42.
We're en route to Atlantic City.

2
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,760
Check, 42.
You're running behind schedule.

3
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,440
Shipside orders, three plus one.

4
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,360
- Jimmy O'Connor and Timmy O'Connor.
- Here.

5
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,320
- Wilhelm.
- Right.

6
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,160
Chilled cargo, containers.
Camden Marine terminal.

7
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,480
- Rivera.
- Yeah.

8
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,600
- Hoffman. O'Hara and Wolkin. Hanratty.
- Yeah.

9
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,600
- Eddie.
- Uh-huh.

10
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,680
- Rudolph. Jackson.
- Yeah.

11
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,640
Final call.
Concentrated OJ., six plus one.

12
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,880
- Benvenuti. McClaghan.
- Yo.

13
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,840
- Jefferson.
- Yeah.

14
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,480
Dunleavy.

15
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,000
- Whoa, there you go.
See what clean livin' can do?
- Shut up.

16
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,680
You, Joey.

17
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,280
Not Joey Coyle.
Joey Sullivan. Come on.

18
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,840
Let's go, Sully.
All right, that's it today.

19
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,000
That's two weeks
almost we ain't workin'.

20
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,120
I can do twice the work of that
old geezer Sullivan, so he must
got somethin' on you, right?

21
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,480
Yeah, he's got four kids
he's gotta feed.
That's what he's got on me.

22
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,040
Come on, find me a slot.
Pad a gang if you have to. Half a day.

23
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,680
You ain't gonna put me to work,
you know, front me some cigarette money.

24
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,600
Hey, a man who can't buy
his own cigarettes,
shouldn't be smokin', should he?

25
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,440
You-You always get philosophical
on me when you don't gimme work.

26
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,560
Come on, William.
I got so many holes in my shirt,
when I walk down the street, I hum.

27
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,760
Hey, little brother!

28
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,280
Tuna fish?

29
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,120
What do you want from me?
Tell it to Eleanor. I'll see you later.

30
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,800
How's it goin'?

31
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,200
What?
Are we lost or what?

32
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,800
- Jesus, man.
- Shortcut to the new highway.

33
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,760
- Joe, what do you want to do now?
- Same thing we always do:

34
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,120
Drive around all day
with our dicks in our hands.

35
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,080
This is gettin' boring,
you know.

36
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,280
Joey, my father don't want
nobody smokin' in this car.

37
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm glad we're
clearin' this up.

38
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,680
Damn lighter
don't work no how.

39
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,800
- Yeah.
- Got my half of that sandwich?

40
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,360
Take the big piece.

41
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,600
Joe, there's more celery
in this than tuna.

42
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,400
You know what
I don't understand.

43
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,960
Your own brother...
can't even give us a job.

44
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,640
That's Billy. Always got to prove to
everybody that he's fair all the time.

45
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,280
It's like... It's like a-acute integrity,
you know what I'm sayin'?

46
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,880
Fuckin' wearin' me out.

47
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,760
It's not my fault
if the city don't fix the roads.

48
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Things'll get better, Joe.
You know?

49
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,360
Things always get better.

50
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,000
Before you know it,
we'll be eligible for retirement.

51
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,960
Down at Atlantic City
sippin' on margaritas or something.

52
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,920
Yeah.
Forty years'll go by in no time.

53
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,480
Hey, pull over. That thing there.
It might make a good toolbox.

54
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,800
- It's a piece of crap.
- Pull over. Stop the car.
Come on, stop the car!

55
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,840
Joey, hurry up
and get your little box, all right?

56
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,720
Move it!
Go! Go!

57
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,920
- I thought you wanted that stinkin' box.
- The hell with the box.

58
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,480
Joey, what the fuck are you doin'?

59
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,760
- Joey, what the hell you got?
- Somethin' on its way to Trump
Taj Mahal in Atlantic City.

60
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,560
- What is it?
- 1.2 million.

61
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,840
1.2 million what?

62
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,680
Hey, Joey, Joey,
that's my mom's crucifix.

63
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,560
- She'd be...
- Aaah.

64
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,360
Joey, is that real?

65
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,160
That looks like
it's real, Joey!

66
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,360
Wow!

67
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,280
Wow!

68
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,920
Wow!

69
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't-Don't touch it, Joey. You don't
wanna get your fingerprints on it.

70
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,880
Okay?
Don't touch the money.

71
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,680
It's all... It's all
hundred dollar bills.

72
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,040
I think these are unmarked!

73
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,360
- You don't find that kind of
money just lying on the street.
- I just did.

74
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,240
- It don't belong to us.
- Finders, keepers, Kenny.

75
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,200
Joey, look at the bag. It says
"Property of the Federal Reserve."

76
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,720
- That makes this a federal offense.
- Kenny, think about it.

77
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,640
- Did we hurt anybody?
- No.

78
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,400
Did we steal it
from anybody? No.

79
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,160
Are we giving it back?
Hell, no!

80
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,560
Possession is nine-tenths of the law.
You know what I'm sayin'?

81
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,760
It's-It's their negligence.

82
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,640
It's their...
Oh, ah, 11:00, 11:00!

83
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,440
- Shit, Joey.
- Drive straight. Drive straight.

84
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,880
We're busted, Joey.

85
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,000
- If we're caught, we're busted.
- Don't drive slow.

86
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,040
- Don't drive slow.
- I'm not, Joe.

87
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,560
Joey, I ain't gonna be nobody's
cell bitch for a sack of dough.

88
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,400
What the hell
are you doin'?

89
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,240
Are you insane?

90
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,480
There are cops
back there.

91
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,720
Joey, listen to me.
We walk over to the cops.

92
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,200
We say, "Cops,
look what we found."

93
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,120
We give 'em the money.
You know there's gonna be a big reward.

94
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,920
Then we'll be big heroes
and we'll be big shots.

95
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
All right? We'll be the guys
who found the money.

96
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,320
Kenny, who wants to be famous
for being stupid?

97
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,880
- Kenny, Kenny, we're keepin' the money.
- You're keepin' the money, Joe.

98
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,440
Kenny, you're gonna regret this
for the rest of your life.

99
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,160
- Half of it's yours. Drive the car.
- Shut up!

100
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,040
All right. This is what's gonna happen.
I never gave you a ride home.

101
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,200
I never saw that money,
all right?

102
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,520
I want you to swear on your
father's grave that whatever
happens, I'm not involved.

103
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,880
I swear to you, Kenny.

104
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,040
- Please drive the car! Fuck it.
- Joey, get out of my car.

105
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,640
I'll see you later.

106
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,320
- Hi, Joey.
- How ya doin', Mrs. Breen?

107
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,640
Anybody home?

108
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,040
Is that you, Joey?

109
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,480
- Yeah, Ma.
- I thought I heard you come in.

110
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,440
I could do with a hand
to carry in the laundry upstairs.

111
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,280
Be right down, Ma.

112
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,360
- You look worried.
- No work.

113
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,920
Well, it'll pick up.

114
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,720
Your father always
used to say...

115
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,040
"Theresa, someday our ship
is gonna come in.

116
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,800
And when it does, we just have
to be careful we're not at the airport. “

117
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,240
You worried
about money, Joey?

118
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,880
- No.
- You sure?

119
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,600
Yeah. I'm all right. Really.

120
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,800
- Sure you're all right.
- Ma. Ma. Ma.

121
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,400
- Take Monica to the movies.
- Mom. Ma.

122
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

123
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,360
Me and Monica,
we're all done.

124
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,560
Well, then you're gonna need it when
you get back together again. Yes, yes.

125
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,520
Joey, what happened
to the bedspread?

126
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,160
I put it outside in the thing
when I was doin' the other thing.

127
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,560
Let me help you with the laundry.

128
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,320
- Somethin' fell. What fell?
- My key.

129
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,720
Lick your fingers, Joey!

130
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,280
This is
your lucky day.

131
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,440
Ninety-one, clear.

132
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,680
I watched them secure the doors.

133
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,480
No way those bags
could've just dropped off.

134
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,840
So do you mind telling me
where they are now?

135
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,600
Do you have any clue where they went?
Did they just fly away?

136
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,840
Pat Laurenzi,
South Detectives.

137
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,280
It's been 48 minutes...

138
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,040
- since I placed the call.
- How much money's missing?

139
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,960
$1.2 million.

140
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,440
Are these the two drivers
in question?

141
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,600
He's the driver.
I'm the hopper.

142
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,880
Hopper. What is that?
Do you hop around?

143
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,480
- I hop out and get the money
while he wait in the truck.
- Detective Laurenzi...

144
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,680
I don't want to jump
to any conclusions before...

145
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,400
you complete
your investigation.

146
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,720
But our equipment is inspected
on a weekly basis.

147
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,240
This obviously
involves human error...

148
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,920
or criminal conspiracy.

149
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,760
Did the alarm malfunction?

150
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,000
The door's locked.
The men carry guns.

151
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,600
An alarm system would be
an unnecessary redundancy.

152
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,680
See, this never would've happened
if you hadn't cut us back.

153
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,400
We used to have
a third man ride in the back.

154
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,640
- Lock me in. Yeah.
- Lock you in?

155
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,480
I ask for a detective.
They send Houdini.

156
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,520
Okay.

157
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,280
The trucks they give us ain't fit
to carry clothes to the Salvation Army.

158
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,480
You're terminated.
Both of you.

159
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,120
I'm on the job 14 years
when you still in school.

160
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,600
It was just me, your father
and two Puerto Ricans
and a converted milk truck.

161
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,320
Look, I got a family to support.
I'm 52 years old. I can't go
and start knockin' on doors now.

162
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,640
You should've thought of that
before you fucked up.

163
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,000
In our top local story tonight,
Liberty Bell Courier announced
$1.2 million fell out...

164
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,960
of the storage compartment
from one of their armored trucks
during a delivery run.

165
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,880
Did I hear that right?
A million bucks fell off a truck?

166
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,680
Our reporter Lois Bowden filed an
earlier report from South Philadelphia...

167
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,320
where police are concentrating
their efforts to recover the lost loot.

168
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,840
- Losing $ 1.2 million isn't as easy...
- Anybody want more fish?

169
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,000
- But it can happen.
- Joey, shhh, I wanna hear this.

170
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,200
Standing beside me is Steve Hrbek,
vice president of Liberty Bell Courier.

171
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,840
Mr. Hrbek,
how could this happen?

172
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,000
I can't give any reason
for this unfortunate mishap.

173
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,480
I can only say that something
went seriously wrong.

174
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,880
- I'll say.
- Even though they are rare,
you find that incidents...

175
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,120
like these
do occur in our business.

176
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,840
Usually the money is recovered
before the story hits the evening news...

177
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,880
but obviously in this case,
that didn't happen.

178
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,120
Is there anything you'd like to say
to the person who found the money?

179
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,480
It's not yours. Give it back.

180
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,360
Reporting from South Philly,
this is Lois Bowden, Channel Five news.

181
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,880
In other news,
60% of Philadelphians we polled...

182
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,480
said they would leave
the City of Brotherly Love,
if given a chance.

183
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,640
Who conducts all these polls, hmm?
Nobody ever asks my opinion.

184
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,280
That dumb S.O.B.
Who found that money...

185
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,280
- he don't even know what he's in for.
- What's an S.O. B?

186
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,080
- Never mind.
- Well, lucky stiff.

187
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,720
He did no more
than the politicians.

188
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,400
He picked up his.
They got theirs handed to 'em.

189
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,560
It ain't against the law
to find money.

190
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,520
- It is to keep it.
- What are you talkin' about?

191
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,560
Happens all the time
down at the docks, right?

192
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,960
Guys tryin' to take home
unclaimed merchandise.

193
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,840
- They're always doin' it
when no one's lookin'.
- Burn 'em at the stake.

194
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,000
- You don't understand anything,
you know that?
- No.

195
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,400
You don't take something
if it's not yours. You just don't.

196
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,720
A lot of people got money
problems, they don't steal.
This guy, he finds this money.

197
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,000
Pennsylvania law says if you
find somethin' worth over $200
and you don't try to return it...

198
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,080
you're committing a crime,
same as stealin'.

199
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,040
And you get up
to five years in prison.

200
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,960
You get five years?

201
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,200
Yeah, for findin'
some money.

202
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,520
What are you,
the attorney general?

203
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,040
If I found that loot...

204
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,560
all them garbage cans up there,
I wouldn't have to be pickin'
out of' em no more.

205
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,280
I'd order me up limousines
two feet longer than anybody else's.

206
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,720
I'd build me a house
way up on top of the hill.

207
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,360
And they'd say, "Man, you live up there?"
I'd say, "Yeah, I live up there."

208
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,400
They'd say, "How you live
way up there?" I'd say,"Man,
it could happen to any of us."

209
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,200
- You know what I mean? Heck, yeah.
- That's a hundred dollar bill.

210
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,000
Whoa!

211
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,760
If I found a million dollars,
I'd buy more shoes than Imelda Marcos.

212
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,920
- The rest I'd probably waste.
- Not me.

213
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,840
I got a condo I can't sell.
The bank's gonna repossess it.

214
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,000
I got a Porsche I can't drive.
The insurance is too high.

215
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,600
I got a girlfriend who likes to drive
through the south of France...

216
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,520
and drink
ten dollar cappuccinos.

217
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,440
If I found a million dollars, I'd put it
up as collateral to get out of debt...

218
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,560
then borrow more money.

219
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,040
There's a gentlemen
staring at you.

220
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,720
- Oh, yeah?
- I think so.

221
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,200
Do you know what you could buy
for $1.2 million?

222
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,640
- I'm gonna come back
and have a drink later.
- Okay.

223
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,360
Could I have a vodka and cranberry?
Stoli, with three limes.

224
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,840
I was sitting here
a minute ago.

225
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,040
- Can I get a Rolling Rock?
- We only carry imported.

226
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,440
- All right, run a tab.
- Okay. I need a credit card.

227
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,120
I'm applyin' for one.

228
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,720
It's okay.

229
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,600
How's everythin'
goin' at the bank?

230
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,120
Joe, get it right. We're not a bank.
We're an investment firm.

231
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,680
- I thought we decided
not to see each other anymore.
- Yeah, we did.

232
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,600
Come on, Monica, I know
you think I'm here...
I don't need a glass.

233
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,400
I know you think I'm gonna try to talk
you into sleeping with me.

234
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,240
And that we're gonna get back
together and then we're gonna
break up. It's gonna be a mess.

235
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,280
I just need your help...
in an area of your expertise.

236
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,120
Expertise in what, Joe?

237
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,720
Money.

238
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,280
Money?

239
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,800
Here's a question, seriously.

240
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,800
Is there a way for a guy
like me, a guy who's stuck...

241
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,960
to walk into your firm
and invest a big chunk of change?

242
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,640
A million cash, you know.
Whatever. What kind of
questions are they gonna ask?

243
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,360
What kind of questions?

244
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,160
They'll need to see picture I.D.,
your social security number.

245
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,480
- That's all I need?
- If it's less than $10,000.

246
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,600
Anything in excess, we're required
to notify the Treasury Department.

247
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,360
Is there a way for me,
you know, and you maybe, to...

248
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,600
move around the commas and
the zeroes so that the I.R.S.
Doesn't find out about it?

249
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,800
Joe,

250
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,160
A guy like you is never gonna
walk into my office with a million cash.

251
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,640
All right.
I mean, who you kidding?

252
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,400
Look at you, you're still wearin' the
same clothes as the last time I saw you.

253
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,120
Check, please.

254
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,600
- I got it.
- No, no, it's on me.

255
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,200
That'll be $9.75.

256
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,080
Hey, you know,
some money fell off an armored truck.

257
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,680
There's a police alert now
for suspicious characters
spending hundred dollar bills.

258
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,120
If Joey Coyle has a hundred dollar bill,
you can rest assured it's his last one.

259
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,560
He's a good lookin' guy, that guy.
You know that guy?

260
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,720
Can I get a pack of Tareytons?
Can you make it two?

261
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,640
So, what do you think?
Do you think this guy's gonna make it?

262
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,640
- I hope so, but half the town
is looking for him.
- Yeah.

263
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,840
- Well, he better go to the other half.
- Yeah. $5.20.

264
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,400
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

265
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,920
Hey, here go that guy
who gave us that money.

266
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,440
- Hey, man. Come on, man.
- No, I'm all right.

267
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,840
I think if I found
that money, I'd give it back.

268
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
You know what my horoscope
said today, Bobby?

269
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,640
It said, "Beware of strangers
bearing gifts because what is
free is too expensive."

270
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,240
Ain't no missin' money.
Government's so deep in debt,
they arrange an accident...

271
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,000
money fallin' out of the back
of an armored truck...

272
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,160
So they can bail out the S & L's.

273
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,240
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Lindey.
Did Dino make his run tonight?

274
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,920
You lost too, huh? Everybody
took the Sixers with the points.

275
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,800
- I need a Rolling Rock.
- If I found that million, I'd go to the dentist.

276
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,320
Then, I'd get rid of that
horrible rug in the den.
But, first, I'd go to the dentist.

277
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,640
Joey, treatin' yourself royally
on my money?

278
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,560
- Your money?
- My money.

279
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,240
You owe me at least
a full tank of gas...

280
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,760
for all them rides
home from the dock, Joe!

281
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,120
You hit me up for a ten-spot
the last time you took out your bitch.

282
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,320
- Whoa. Her name's Monica.
- All right.

283
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,840
Thank you. Really.

284
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,640
Dino.

285
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,320
- Hello, Lindey.
- Yo.

286
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,640
Bud Light.

287
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,480
Hey, Dino,
I got that ten-spot I lost on the game.

288
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,640
Hey, Lindey! So, what would it cost
to buy the house a drink?

289
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,000
What are you gonna use
for money, deutsche marks?

290
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,960
Like I was saying,
how much is it gonna cost...

291
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,200
to get everybody in this bar so drunk
they're pissin' out their ears?

292
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,400
- Four hundred bucks.
- Four hundred bucks? Everybody?

293
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,720
Everybody, including me!

294
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,440
All right, then, there's
gonna be no more bitchin'
about this man. Dino Palladino.

295
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,280
How he comes in here every night
and he books your bets and...

296
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,400
- he doesn't pay off
because I'm livin' proof.
- C-notes.

297
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,840
Not even Atlantic City can provide
what Dino Palladino provides...

298
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,000
to the South Philly
gamblin' community.

299
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,880
- All right, Joey.
- Put your money away.

300
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,360
All right, comin' up.
Who's next?

301
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,080
No loyalty.
You bet against our Sixers?

302
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,840
Ah, it wasn't B-ball.
Picked a pony.

303
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,320
- It's a pony.
- A pony?

304
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,280
Yeah.

305
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,400
- You and me.
- Let's not panic. Lorraine,
take care of those guys.

306
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,600
- What do you got? Two Bud's.
- Talk to me, baby.

307
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,640
I need a fresh beer.

308
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,240
- Lock the door.
- Go.

309
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,160
- Let's see it.
- Go, go!

310
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,120
- Let me see it.
- Go.

311
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Joe, listen. I know mooks
that have spent their whole lives...

312
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,520
trying to figure out a way
to pop an armored car.

313
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,880
In my book,
I look up to you.

314
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,320
All right, so we're
just gonna walk in...

315
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,320
we're gonna launder it,
and we're gonna walk out.

316
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,280
That's right.
You'll get it tonight, Joe.

317
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,920
Tonight.
And now, you gotta do me a favor.

318
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,720
When we walk in there,
let me handle it...

319
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
'cause I've done it before.

320
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,360
I've done all this shit before
so let me handle it.

321
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,720
Don't bullshit me,
all right?

322
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,920
You ain't never even seen
$1.2 million before tonight.

323
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,080
Why you come to me?

324
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,200
Huh? I mean, go to Monica.

325
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,240
Go to your girl.

326
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,160
She works in a bank.

327
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,800
You walk in that place with that kind
of money, they'll handcuff you to a desk.

328
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,960
I came to you.
Okay?

329
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,240
No one saw you
picking it up?

330
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,840
Right?

331
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,560
You and me...
are the only ones that know about this.

332
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,320
Piece of cake.

333
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,520
So, when I swap the hundreds,
I'm gonna get back tens,
fifties, anything I want?

334
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
- L-It's gonna be okay with this guy?
- The guy's loaded.

335
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,720
He collects every bet in South Phil.
What else do you want, Joe?

336
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,720
- Is that his car?
- Yeah, one of them.
He's a real connoisseur.

337
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,840
- Yeah, he knows his shit, huh?
- Yeah.

338
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,240
- Joey, Joey, gimme a minute.
- In here or out there?

339
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,160
- You want me to walk around? Stay put.
- No, no. S-Stay put.

340
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,040
So, are we gonna
go out tonight?

341
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,280
- Yeah, we'll go to Angelo's.
- Mr. Goldoni?

342
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,080
- I brought the guy that found
the Liberty Bell money.
- Where is he?

343
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,640
He's right over there.

344
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,040
Yeah, maybe Nevada is
but we're not Nevada here.

345
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,680
- That's him. Joseph.
- Bring him in the office.

346
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,560
- Five and a half
to five on the play-offs?
- Move to even.

347
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,880
- He's close to clean.
- Cover.

348
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,400
Yeah, this is Corky.
The thing is what it is.

349
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,240
- You keep four, Joe.
- Slow down. Slow down.

350
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,640
You're gonna break
the sound barrier.

351
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:42,040
Now, for every 400,000 I give you,
what are you prepared to give me?

352
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,200
For every four you give us,
we give you back three.

353
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,480
Joe, he's
giving you $300,000.

354
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,320
- I'm giving him four.
- Joe, it's not a matter of....

355
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,720
what you want us to give you,
it's how much you wanna give us.

356
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,720
Now, I'll tell you what. For the 1.2,
I'll give you back a million.

357
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,120
That way
you save 100,000.

358
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,400
Yeah, but if 1.2 costs two,
how come four costs one?

359
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,560
You keep four, Joe!

360
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,480
I take eight, give you back
seven out of the eight, same
as I would three out of four.

361
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,040
It's the same thing.

362
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,400
L-l-I don't get it.
Really, I don't. You get it?

363
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,760
He's taking one from four.
He's not taking anything
from the eight...

364
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,520
except his vig
of his first four.

365
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,520
- It's pretty clear.
- I don't get it. I'm sorry.

366
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,760
Is that how much I'm gonna give you
or how much you're... gonna give me?

367
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:39,320
In terms of empathy, in the sense of...
putting oneself inside...

368
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,480
the skin of another person,
I admire that man.

369
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,200
He was an inventor.

370
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,520
He had imagination.

371
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,160
He was a bit of a fatso,
but he was sexually active.

372
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,280
And of....

373
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,280
all of the Founding Fathers...

374
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,200
whose faces appear
on hard currency...

375
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,920
he's the only one
cracking a smile; Ben Franklin.

376
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,280
Why's Ben smilin'?

377
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,320
He was smart enough
not to be president.

378
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,680
He lived in a tree house
for a period of time, Joe.

379
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,600
What are you tal...

380
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,920
What are you talking about?
What has this got to do
with launderin' my money?

381
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,120
He was a playful man.
He flew a kite.

382
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,920
- What was on the end of Ben
Franklin's kite, historically?
- A piece of string.

383
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,760
String.
What was on the end of the string?

384
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,520
- Dino?
- A kite?

385
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,080
A key.

386
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,560
A key. A key!

387
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,880
Exactly.
He caught lightning in a bottle!

388
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,960
The same way
you did, Joe.

389
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,120
The same way you did.

390
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:54,520
That doesn't happen to too many
people in their lifetimes,
but it happened to you.

391
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,040
Think about it.

392
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,080
What are you gonna do?

393
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,120
You can give us the money...
and spend it while
you're young, enjoy it.

394
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,840
Or you can dig a hole,
stick it in...

395
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,160
and hope that it's still there
when you dig it up.

396
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,720
It's up to you.

397
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,680
We do this tonight.

398
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,120
It's the weekend. It'll take maybe two,
three-three days at the most.

399
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,480
Three days?

400
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,800
- Three days. It's not like a week.
- He said we could do it in one night.

401
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,760
- That's a lot of money to count.
- Joe, there's only six here.

402
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,200
- Where's the rest?
- You said we could do this in one night.

403
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,200
- You said you were bringing 1.2.
- So what, that's my business.

404
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,160
- So what? It's my business.
- It's my business.

405
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,400
- Shut up!
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

406
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,120
Okay, the man has a right
to be cautious. Joe...

407
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,680
you give us the six tonight,
we'll give you back the five,
then we repeat the process.

408
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,520
So I get...

409
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,360
my first five before I get you
your second six?

410
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,280
That's the deal.
That's it.

411
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,280
- Okay, Joe. Okay.
- Done.

412
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,720
Now, is there anything you want, Joe?
Anything you need? Tuna, anything?

413
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,320
No, no, I'm not hungry.
Uh, I just gotta get home.

414
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,240
- Gotta get home?
- Yeah.

415
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,480
Dino, give him your shit box.

416
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,760
It's a Cadillac.

417
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,800
Take care of my money.

418
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,440
- Let's check this area.
- I already checked it.

419
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,880
Well, check it again.

420
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,320
If I found that kind of money,
you'd never hear from me again.

421
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,840
Twenty-four hours...

422
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,040
- and not a single clue.
- That's because $10,000
isn't enough reward.

423
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,560
You might not catch the guy
who stole the money...

424
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,280
but you'll probably
get his neighbor.

425
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,640
This is South Philly,
Mr. Hrbek.

426
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,360
If you weren't familiar with
the neighborhood, you wouldn't
even know that street existed.

427
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,240
If somebody in one of those
row houses got $1.2 million...

428
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,720
believe me, they're gonna talk
to somebody.

429
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,640
Is that how you solve crimes in South
Philly, Detective? Waiting around...

430
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,480
for the crook
to tell the wrong person?

431
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,200
You know somethin'?
You guys are in business
because people can't be trusted.

432
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,160
And if we don't find that money
to everyone's satisfaction...

433
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,240
you might not be in business
for too much longer.

434
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,640
Now, both your drivers passed
their polygraph test with flying colors.

435
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,240
And the insurance company
knows that the accident happened
due to equipment malfunction...

436
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,200
so you can forget
about a settlement.

437
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,200
Raise the reward.

438
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,040
It costs money
to find money...

439
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,320
Mr. Hrbek.

440
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,760
I'll double the reward.

441
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,640
$20,000 is still below
the going rate of a row house.

442
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,920
Well, I'm not familiar with the price
of real estate in South Philly.

443
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,480
Well, maybe you should
read up on it.

444
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,760
You come up with 50 grand,
somebody's gonna talk.

445
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,160
No, no, the reward stays at 20.

446
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,600
You guys are still issued
rotary phones?

447
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:17,360
Yeah, you just put your finger
in the little hole around
the number and drag it around.

448
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,280
It takes a little longer
but it still works.

449
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,560
Thank you.

450
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,120
Ladies and gentlemen.

451
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,320
Ladies and gentlemen.

452
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,640
Monica.

453
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,960
Hey, Joe.

454
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,040
Get in.

455
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,760
El D.
Real leather seats.

456
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,280
You're doin' good, Joe.
Comin' up in life, huh?

457
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,480
It's a nice car.

458
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,560
I've been doin' some thinkin'. I want
you to be straight with me on somethin'.

459
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,440
- Will you do that for me?
- I think that's always best.

460
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,200
Now, nobody died in your family,
so I know you didn't inherit any money.

461
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,800
- No, everybody's healthy.
- I'm glad to hear it.

462
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,760
And I checked the paper.
You didn't win the lottery.

463
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,160
No, I wouldn't waste my money
on a government racket.

464
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,520
Uh-huh.
And you're not a big gambler.

465
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,760
Here and there,
a little bit, you know.

466
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,000
Joe, I want you
to do me a favor.

467
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,160
Yeah?

468
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,800
Can you show me what
$1.2 million looks like?

469
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,880
I could arrange that.

470
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,840
It's like you dream of somethin' like
this happenin' and then it happens...

471
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,240
and-and you feel numb,
you know what I mean?

472
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,120
Think about it, whatever you need,
like medical, take care of your family.

473
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,120
I mean, even after that,
you know, anything.

474
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,840
Anything...
that needs to be done...

475
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,640
can now be done.

476
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,120
I mean, that'll really work
on your brain, you know what I mean?

477
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,040
I mean, what'd you want? Anything in
the world. Where do you wanna go?

478
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,480
- To Paris for breakfast?
Anything, it doesn't matter.
- I would love...

479
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,120
to go on vacation with you.

480
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,760
Now we can go to the Caribbean, you
know. Take one of those cruise ships.

481
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,560
- Yeah.
- Take some mambo classes.

482
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,880
Two hundred extra for mambo.

483
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,080
And we could use some new clothes
to go on the trip with, you know.

484
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,360
Yeah. You need some clothes.

485
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,240
- Not the five and dime, come on.
- Oh, she wants the top of the line.

486
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:11,520
Yes, I do. And, you know, I've always
wanted to continue my education.

487
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,480
- College?
- Mm-hmm.

488
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,760
- That's gonna take money.
- Yes, it will.

489
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,600
That's for college.

490
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,200
And this is for uh, for uh,
your-your breeding and your grades.

491
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,080
Excuse me?
Look who's talking.

492
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,520
God, you know, I thought I had
a decent job taking home $350 a week.

493
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,160
Yeah.

494
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:37,480
I'd be, I'd be a grandmother
by the time I earned $1.2 million.

495
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,360
You'd think a life's worth of toil would
amount to more than this, you know.

496
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,880
- And all this is only half the money.
- Half?

497
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,200
- Yeah.
- Where's the other half?

498
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,280
It's bein' washed.

499
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,360
Washed?

500
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,280
Yeah. Washed.

501
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,680
- As in laundered?
- Yes, as in hand-washed, laundered.

502
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,680
So we can spend it while we're young.
That's the idea.

503
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,400
Who did you give the rest to?

504
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,840
A friend.

505
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,280
Someone I know?

506
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,400
You might.

507
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,680
Who, Joe?

508
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,800
- I went to Catholic school with him.
- You went to Catholic school...

509
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,000
with 400 people.

510
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,680
Don't tell me Dino.
Not Dino Palladino.

511
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,160
The one and only.

512
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,760
So, he's the only one
who knows besides you and me?

513
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,000
- Except for Kenny.
- You told Kozlowski?

514
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,440
Kenny was there when I found it.
Dino doesn't know because
Kenny says he wasn't there.

515
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,360
You know what I'm sayin'?

516
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,440
That's just great, Joe.

517
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,920
So, it's just, you know, basically,
Dino, Kenny, me and you.

518
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,200
- This is great.
- Where you goin'?

519
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,240
Look, I'm not stickin' around when Dino
and his boys come for the rest of it.

520
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,840
Those guys will slit
your throat for five bucks.

521
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,800
Those guys are businessmen
like everybody else.

522
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,320
- Yeah, right.
- All right, you're so smart...

523
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,600
I come to you for advice
the other day and you wouldn't
even give me the time of day.

524
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,760
What are you gonna do if a
million-two drops in your lap
and you gotta change it?

525
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,360
I'll tell ya what I wouldn't do.
I wouldn't give $600,000 to some
small-time hustler, Joe.

526
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,920
And I wouldn't go spend
a fortune to show off to some girl...

527
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,680
who already
gave up on you.

528
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,880
You're saying you're only here
with me 'cause of the money?

529
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,840
Good-bye, Joe.

530
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,120
- Hey, you kids. Hey, wait a minute!
- Cops! Come on, let's go!

531
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,360
Hey, come here!

532
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,280
Hey, come on back!

533
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,040
- Oh, hey, hey, hey, come here.
- No.

534
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,840
Relax.
You wanna wear these?

535
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,400
Gimme that.
You got a hunting license, son?

536
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,280
You don't need a license
to hunt rats.

537
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,120
Well, I guess you've never heard
of the Endangered Species Act?

538
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,480
- It was only a rat.
- Well, I just seen another
dead rat right over there.

539
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,360
- Were you around here on Friday?
- No, I was in school studyin'.

540
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,560
- Oh, yeah, I bet you were.
- I was.

541
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,720
I don't think so. You saw
a yellow metal tub fall off
the back of an armored truck?

542
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,400
- I didn't see squat.
- Put it this way.

543
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,160
You tell me what you saw,
I'll give your bow back.
If you don't, I'm gonna break it.

544
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,400
I might've seen someone pick up
somethin' that don't belong to him.

545
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,280
Was he tall? Short? Thin?
Fat? Blue? Green?

546
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,840
- He was a regular-lookin' white dude.
- Like somebody from the neighborhood?

547
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,760
- Yeah, I might've seen him before.
- What kind of car was he drivin'?

548
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,560
Shitty. Gray fender needed paint.
Chevy Chevelle.

549
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,800
- A shitty Chevy Chevelle?
- Yeah.

550
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,640
You sure about that
or you just guessin'?

551
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,880
Of course I'm sure. I spent all winter
sleepin' in back of one.

552
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,440
Get outta here.

553
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,720
- Loose in front! Score!
- Yes!

554
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
Brind'Amour!

555
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,360
- You weren't there, remember?
- Joey, this has turned into a big deal.

556
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,920
- You saw the papers?
- Yeah, but it's okay.

557
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,320
- The priest is talkin'
about it in his sermon.
- It's a moral issue.

558
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,120
Murray the cakeman keeps talkin' about
they're gonna catch you this weekend.

559
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,720
- He said they're gonna catch
"the guy" this weekend.
- Forget about the cakeman.

560
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,520
You just need a drink.
You need to relax. Drink up. Lindey!

561
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,880
- This thing is makin' my stomach hurt.
- Coyle!

562
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,560
- Buy me a drink.
- Yeah, Joey, buy us a drink.

563
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,040
- Two more.
- With all your winnings?

564
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,520
- What is he talkin' about, "winnings"?
- Uhhh.

565
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,760
- He's just bustin' my balls.
- So why you buy him a drink?

566
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,960
- 'Cause he's an asshole.
- So you buy him a drink?

567
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,000
- What is that?
- Tequila.

568
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,320
- What do I care?
- Ohhh, tequila.

569
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,560
- Happy days.
- Salud.

570
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,360
- Ahhh. You're beautiful, Joe.
- Yeah.

571
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,840
Joe?

572
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,720
I'm curious. What race was it
that you won your money?

573
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,160
- Why you curious?
- Relax.

574
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,640
- What race was it?
- Uh, it was the seventh at Philly Park.

575
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,720
What was the name
of the horse?

576
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,800
- Nice.
- Dumb Luck.

577
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,080
- Lindey, you got Friday's race results?
- Yo.

578
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,480
- I can fish it out of the garbage.
- Why you bustin' my balls?

579
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,280
I want to pin it up.

580
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,480
Look at this, 20,000.

581
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,160
Twenty-thousand reward.
I find a million-two,
I'm gonna give it up for 20 grand?

582
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,840
- I don't think so.
- What was that? The seventh
race at Philly Park?

583
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,200
- Yeah.
- Dumb Luck?

584
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,120
That's the horse.

585
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,040
Joe, there ain't no horse
named Dumb Luck.

586
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,640
You can't believe everything
you read in the newspapers.

587
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,200
Joe, I usually believe it
when they're payin' me off.

588
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,880
You know, I think it's some sort of...
strange typo or somethin'.

589
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,960
They don't have any typos
in the racing section.

590
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,360
How could 22 guys
take a leak at the same time?

591
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,080
- Prostate, maybe.
- Guess it must be goin' around.

592
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,440
- A hundred dollar bill.
I'm looking for 12,000 of these.
- You know, it's funny but...

593
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,720
I seen Ben Franklin standing out
by the Liberty Bell...

594
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,600
and he was handin' out hundred
dollar bills to every tourist in town.

595
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,520
Dunleavy, let's not make
a hero out of a jerk.

596
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,360
What makes you think the guy
who found the money's a jerk?

597
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,200
'Cause he's got the cops
lookin' for him.

598
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,200
You wouldn't happen
to know where he is?

599
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,800
- We should tell 'em.
He's gonna find out anyway.
- You wanna know who found it?

600
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,440
It's Kozlowski.

601
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,680
- That him?
- That's him right there.

602
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,280
Is it true what they say?

603
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,960
- You know about the money?
- If I found the money, I'd give it back.

604
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,960
Yeah, yeah.
I believe maybe you would.

605
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,880
- Yes, I would.
- You must be the only one
around here that would.

606
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,160
I would.

607
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I got an idea that whoever found
that money is from this neighborhood.

608
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,280
Maybe it's someone
that everyone knows.

609
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,920
Well, here's my card.

610
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,360
Anybody wants to talk.

611
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,000
- Anybody?
- Yeah, I'll take one.

612
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,400
You never know.

613
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,080
- Why... Why'd you take his card?
- Shut up.

614
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,440
Joe.

615
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,760
Somethin'
I can do for you?

616
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,120
- Joe, you owe me.
- What do you call that?

617
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:57,760
- Call it what you want.
- You gonna keep your mouth shut?

618
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,880
Yeah.

619
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,040
- Hold on, hold on. Wait 'til he leaves.
- Why'd you give him the money?

620
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,960
- He just left.
- Why did you give him the money?

621
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,320
Just sit down.

622
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,920
- Kenny, Kenny.
- I wasn't gonna be involved.
Now, you're draggin' me down.

623
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,240
Nobody is goin' down, all right.
Nobody's goin' down!

624
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,040
- No...
- Way to go, J. C...

625
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,160
You neglected to mention
the Chevelle.

626
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,600
Joey, he knows
about my father's car?

627
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,960
- You got this idiot involved with me?
- I'm not...

628
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,680
- I had nothin' to do with it.
- Shut up! Shut up!

629
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,480
Will you fuckin' relax? We're in the
street and there was a cop in there.

630
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,920
- It's all over the radio.
- What?

631
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,320
- The Chevelle. Shut up!
- You got my father's car on the radio?

632
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,000
- The keys.
- You got my father's car
on the radio, Joe?

633
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,520
- My father's car is on the radio?
- Gimme the keys.

634
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,280
- Gimme the keys.
- The radio's broken in the house.

635
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,760
- They don't listen to the radio.
- Joe, gimme the keys.

636
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,160
All right.

637
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,200
We're gonna get the car painted. Yeah,
we're gonna make it look brand new.

638
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,240
Joe, gimme the keys.

639
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,160
Joey, gimme the keys!

640
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,000
What the hell are you...
No. I don't believe this.

641
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,840
You said that I wasn't
gonna be involved with this.

642
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,480
- Joey, there ain't
no paint shop around here.
- Go and pull over.

643
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,560
- Joey, where's the paint shop?
- Kill the engine.

644
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,800
Joey, what are we doin'?

645
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,320
Please, kill the engine.

646
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:54,280
I'm gonna make it up to you.

647
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,400
Joey, this is
my father's car.

648
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,600
I'll buy him ten new ones.

649
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,640
- Open the door!
- No!

650
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,480
- Kenny, get out of the car.
- I'm not gettin' out of the car.

651
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,440
You wanna go to jail?
You wanna see your father go
to jail? Get out of the car.

652
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,840
- No!
- You're gonna suffocate in there.

653
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,320
How am I gonna get a paramedic
out here during a football
game? Get out of the car.

654
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,360
- No.
- You get out of the car,
you big dumb Polack!

655
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,200
- I'm not gettin' out!
- Get out, Kenny!

656
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,240
Kenny, I'm not playing with you. Get out
of the car right now! It's not a game!

657
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,520
He's locked in, huh? I'll show you
how to get him out of the car.

658
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,120
- I'll show you.
- It's my problem. I'm takin' care of it.

659
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,040
- He can't go nowheres. I got the keys.
- I got no time to breast-feed...

660
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,960
this motherfucker.

661
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,160
- Hey, come on, whoa.
What-What are you gonna do?
- I'll give him a haircut.

662
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,560
- That's about it.
- It's my problem.
I'm gonna take care of it.

663
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,720
Take care of it.
I'll give you five seconds.

664
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,960
One Mississippi...
two Mississippi...

665
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,880
three Mississippi...
four...

666
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,440
Go on.
Take care of it.

667
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,400
No, Joe. Aaah!

668
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,920
Joe! Don't! Aaah!

669
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,240
Joe! I'm gettin' out.

670
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,560
- Don't hit me. Don't hit me.
- Get out!

671
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,760
Hey, Dino, you got any idea
when my money's gonna be ready?

672
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,080
Fuck. You were in the room.
What did he say?

673
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:13,120
- That's tomorrow night.
- That's right. Now remember,
to get the five for six...

674
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,480
you need to change
the whole 1.2.

675
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,720
Say that again.

676
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,960
To get the five for six,
you need to change the whole 1.2.
That's the deal you made.

677
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,200
That's exactly not
the deal I made.

678
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,280
- That's the deal...
- You tell me to my face
that that's the deal I made.

679
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:35,720
- Say it right to my face,
"That's the deal you made."
- That's the deal you made.

680
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:40,360
Joe, you lied to me. You lied
to me about the car. You lied
to me about douche bag there.

681
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,560
I mean, what the fuck do you think
I do for a living, sell shoes?

682
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,320
Come on. This is serious shit.
These people are not to be fucked with.

683
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,600
Now, I don't wanna see you
at Dempsey's or anywhere else.

684
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,440
You're gonna go home, lock the door,
draw the curtains and stay home, Joe.

685
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,040
And then tomorrow,
bring the other six, Joe.

686
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,280
You got it?

687
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,360
It's all... clear.

688
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,200
- Is somebody there?
- Yeah, Ma.

689
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,960
Joey. What time is it?
What are you lookin' for?

690
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,920
- I was just rustlin' through
some of Dad's stuff.
- Come here.

691
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,400
Sit down.

692
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,800
You know, Joe, your father,
he misses you very much.

693
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,960
Look at you.
You don't take care of yourself.

694
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,400
I'm all right, Ma.
Just a little worn out.

695
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:03,080
- Mmm.
- So, how do you know he misses me?

696
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,560
We communicate.

697
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,200
You do?

698
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,360
We still talk.
All the time.

699
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:17,080
Has he said anything
about me lately?

700
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,600
He knows exactly
what's goin' on with you, Joey.

701
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,480
He didn't tell you
how it was gonna turn out did he?

702
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,480
Do you think Dad would be
happier if we moved him out that...

703
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,400
that scummy cemetery
out there under that freeway?

704
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,760
And we move him out in the country,
you know? Someplace nice.

705
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,280
With some birds and some trees,
you know. A river. Somethin'.

706
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,520
Joey...

707
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:51,360
whatever you're gonna give
your father, you already...

708
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,560
gave him while
he was still alive.

709
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,040
Do you need anything, Ma?

710
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,160
No, thanks, son.

711
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,880
- I gotta go out.
- Mmm.

712
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,520
- Boo! Got you!
- Jesus Christ!

713
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,520
- What are you doing in there?
How'd you get in there?
- I picked the lock.

714
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,440
- Why'd you go in there?
What are you lookin' for?
- I was just playing a trick.

715
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,560
Get outta here.

716
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,400
Don't do that sort of thing!
Stay outta my room!

717
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,640
- What's the matter? What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

718
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,520
Tell her to stay
outta my room! All right?

719
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,960
- Get out, you hog.
You been in there for an hour.
- I'll be out in a minute.

720
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,600
Come on, Kate. Cut it out.
I'm comin' out right now.

721
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,800
Hurry up.

722
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:56,520
- You gonna forgive me?
- No.

723
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,560
- You sure?
- Stop it.

724
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:03,200
All right, all right.
Just quit bugging me.

725
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,880
Geez!

726
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,920
Damn it!

727
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,920
- Whoa!
- My god!

728
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:05,400
Joey! Joey, what happened?
Are you hurt?

729
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,960
Joey.

730
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,120
Joey, did you find
the Liberty Bell money?

731
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,600
Mom, look. It's a real
hundred dollar bill.

732
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,960
Did you find that money, Joey?

733
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,960
What does it look like?

734
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,920
- You been lying to us?
- I did not lie.

735
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,600
I just didn't
tell the whole truth.

736
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:34,160
So what are you all
lookin' at?

737
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,280
Here, Billy.

738
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:40,600
Here. That'll fix the ceiling.

739
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:46,200
Billy, redo the entire house.

740
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,080
And pay off
the mortgage.

741
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,440
Here, let's buy Ma...
Ma, we'll buy you...

742
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,840
a summer house
on the Jersey shore.

743
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,240
With your own
private fishing boat.

744
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,680
With your own
private dock.

745
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:06,680
Katie! Katie, Katie needs, uh...
braces, right?

746
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,760
And, uh, she wants,
uh, a new bike.

747
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,680
And she wants
to go to college.

748
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,200
I don't want to be rich
if I have to go to school!

749
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,920
Eleanor wants
a new wardrobe and a new TV.

750
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,320
Go to Iowa and visit relatives
you never even knew that you had.

751
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,240
Whoa.
W-W-W-Wait a minute.

752
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,240
We don't need no money
that don't belong to us.

753
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,520
Let them talk!

754
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,280
- I'll take the bike and a few hundred.
- No, you won't.

755
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:34,360
- Get in your room right now.
- She wants the bike!

756
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,000
Joey, if the old man
taught us anything...

757
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,880
he taught us you don't
get somethin' for nothin', right?

758
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,640
No such thing
as a free lunch.

759
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,680
Then what's that
in my hand, Billy?

760
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,320
Billy, the old man is dead.

761
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,560
Remember what it was like
when he was alive? Remember that?

762
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:57,840
Workin' 18 hour days, his hands all
busted up. He couldn't even make a fist.

763
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,760
Three, four glycerin tablets
at a time to keep his heart pumpin'?

764
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,840
- You remember that? Yeah?
- Yeah, I remember.

765
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,640
And if you know what's good for you,
you just leave the old man out of this.

766
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,800
What good did it do him?
What good did it do him?

767
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:13,480
His son is drinkin'
in the same bar stool that he was.

768
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,200
Joey, you're gonna
clean this mess up...

769
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,280
and we're gonna go down there tomorrow
morning and give that money back.

770
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,560
Give it back?
What are you, nuts?

771
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:28,440
What do you think I got
to look forward to in my life? What?

772
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,680
I measure my life
in unemployment checks, Billy.

773
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,000
I'm 26 years old and I live in the same
room right down the hall from my mom!

774
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,160
What do I got to look forward to?
What about my family?

775
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,160
What about my future?
I got nothin'!

776
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,800
I can't even get my own goddamn
brother to give me work!

777
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,200
Shut up! Shut up!
I do my best for you!

778
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,120
- Yeah!
- The best I can!

779
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,040
- You son-of-a-bitch!
- Hey, hey! Break it up! Break it up!

780
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,240
- I'm keepin' the goddamn money!
- You're givin' it back!

781
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,800
- You are givin' it back! You hear me?
- Eleanor! Stop it!

782
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,800
- I ain't givin' shit back!
- You son-of-a-bitch!

783
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,000
Eleanor, take your husband to bed.

784
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,960
- You're givin' it back!
- Shut up, Billy! Go to bed!

785
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:08,280
You're givin' that money back!
I want you outta this house
if you keep that money.

786
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,640
Stop it!

787
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:19,720
Joey. Joey, everybody
needs money to live...

788
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,640
but not
this kind of money.

789
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:26,120
No, Ma. It's found money.
The answer to our prayers.

790
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:32,320
Your father used to say to me,
"Be careful what you pray for.

791
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,320
You might get it."

792
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,600
You gotta give
this money back, Joey.

793
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,440
I ain't givin' it back.

794
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,200
I'll say a prayer
for you, Joe.

795
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,800
And that's when I seen
these guys push the car in the river.

796
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,720
How many?
Two, three, four?

797
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,320
Two, three, could have been more.
But it was definitely couple of few.

798
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,360
What did
they look like?

799
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:26,440
Bent noses. Mobsters. Guys that
look like they're up to no good.

800
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,840
- Then what happened?
- Then they left in a fancy Caddy.

801
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,720
That's the wrong car.

802
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,720
What? Oh, oh, oh!

803
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,800
What do you... What do you... Excuse me!
What do you mean "wrong car"?

804
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,480
That's a Dodge.
We only pay for Chevelles.

805
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,760
What are you talkin' about?
Where's my cash?

806
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:51,320
- What?
- My cash. My money. My reward.

807
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,440
Take it up with Hrbek.
Liberty Bell.

808
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:57,120
You know, I took off
from work to be here.

809
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,320
That's what I get
for gettin' involved with cops?

810
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,040
- Hey, frogman!
- Yo.

811
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:29,960
Right here.

812
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:45,600
- Monica!
- Oh, god.

813
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,680
Discount from book on an I.P.O.
With great cash flow.

814
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,240
Sully and Sons wants to lay off
half a million shares.

815
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,440
- Monica, are you listening to me?
- L-I.P.O. Great cash flow.

816
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,720
- Right. Check and see if Sully
settled on that last trade.
- Yeah.

817
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,200
Joe, if you're not here on business,
I don't have time for this.

818
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,880
Miss Russo, I'd like to invest
$600,000 'til later tonight.

819
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,640
Now, any interest you might
make on that investment...

820
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,680
is yours to keep.

821
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,720
Joe, it's taken me three years
to go from receptionist to new accounts.

822
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,880
Get my own desk.

823
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,840
It's all clear now.
So in three more years...

824
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,960
you're gonna get a new desk
that's gonna be five feet away.

825
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,200
And if you really
kiss ass...

826
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,880
you're gonna get
your very own key to the toilet.

827
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,480
Listen, Joe, I don't kiss ass.
I busted my ass to get where I am.

828
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,400
So don't be disrespectful.

829
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,680
Buy two first class tickets.

830
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,200
I don't care where. Anywhere.
As long as it's out of the country.

831
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,760
What do you expect me to do?
Risk my life for you?

832
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:53,720
W-Where do you get off coming in
here to my place of work?

833
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,600
You're crazy.

834
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,680
Meet me at Dempsey's Bar
at 11:00. Don't be late.

835
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,360
What if I don't show?

836
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,480
Well, you'll be
that much richer.

837
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,800
I love you, baby.

838
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:29,800
Monica, yes or no. I'm still
waitin' to hear on that.
Did Sully settle on that trade?

839
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,880
- Maybe, maybe not.
- This kind of opportunity
doesn't happen every day.

840
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,760
Busted windshield.

841
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,000
It's anybody's guess
if it's a Chevelle.

842
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,600
You want me
to bring it up?

843
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,840
No, let's come back tomorrow.
Yeah, bring it up.

844
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,800
- How're doin', Joe?
- Hi.

845
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,640
Hi, Joe. How you doin'?

846
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,920
You guys got my half mil
broken down as agreed?

847
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,240
Well, to get five for six,
you gotta...

848
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,880
you gotta show me
the second six first.

849
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,800
You're changin'
the deal on me.

850
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,720
- No, we're not.
- Joe, let him see it.

851
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,840
Let him see it.

852
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:41,080
What the fuck
is this shit?

853
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,440
Joe. Joe. Joe.

854
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:51,800
I want my money.
All I want is my money.

855
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,840
Just give me my money.
It's my money.

856
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:58,800
We're doin' you a favor. What the hell
are you doin'? Put that down.

857
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,720
- It's my money.
- All right. Bring him his money.

858
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,920
Dino, bring him his money.
Every penny.

859
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:19,240
You know, the only
real question with money is...

860
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:22,040
do you posses it
or does it posses you?

861
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,760
Shut up. And I don't wanna hear about
Ben Franklin havin' sex in a tree house.

862
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:31,480
I think that,
uh, the ink...

863
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,280
from the bills...

864
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,120
is seeping
into your bloodstream, Joe.

865
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,920
And it's, it's...
affecting your equilibrium.

866
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,400
- Got your money, Joe.
- Put it on the ground.

867
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:53,120
Against the wall. Get against the wall.
Put your hands against the wall.

868
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:56,280
Lie down.

869
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:59,320
Put your legs
up in the air.

870
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,880
Nickels?

871
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,520
Nickels?

872
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:22,240
Quarters?
You gave me quarters?

873
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,800
Well, the deal was...

874
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,960
to break down
the money, Joe.

875
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:31,280
You did not specify
what denominations.

876
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,040
You evil son-of-a-bitch.

877
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:38,640
You give me my money or I'm gonna shoot
you. You're gamblin' with your life.

878
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,960
- Joe, don't be a punk, huh?
- Legs up!

879
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,160
They're up.

880
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,680
You're not gonna shoot me.

881
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,840
- How do you know?
- Because if you shoot me...

882
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,280
you got nothing,
nothing.

883
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:58,720
You got 600,000 bucks
squirreled away somewhere, Joe.

884
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,640
Go home.

885
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:12,320
Put the gun down, Joe.
You'll be able to carry more money.

886
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,440
Philadelphia police!
Open the door!

887
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:41,440
I was wonderin'
when you were gonna get here.

888
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,480
- Don't. Don't.
- You didn't do nothin'!
What did you do to my car?

889
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,400
- That's enough. Leave him alone.
- Get outta here!

890
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:58,320
- What did you do to my car?
- It wasn't me! It was Joey!

891
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,920
- Joey, who?
- Answer his question.

892
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,640
- Answer it!
- Joey Coyle! It was Joey Coyle, Dad!

893
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:08,480
- It was Joey Coyle!
- Joey Coyle did it, huh?

894
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,440
- Get in the house!
- He made me do it.
Don't hurt me, Dad, please.

895
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,360
- I'm sorry, Dad! I'm sorry!
- Go be sorry in the house!

896
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:17,080
- I'm sorry!
- Get in the house!
Yeah, you'll be sorry.

897
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,200
Joey Coyle
found the money. Hey!

898
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,200
Joey Coyle found the money! Yo!

899
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,600
Yo! Joey!

900
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:30,040
Monica show up?

901
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,520
She don't come around
much anymore.

902
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,720
We guarantee
every day good rates, interest...

903
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,160
- What time is it?
- 11:30.

904
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:45,160
Well. I see. All right.

905
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,840
Where you goin'? Come on, sit down.
Have an eye-opener.

906
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,960
Why not? Sure.

907
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,440
See if my brother
wants a drink.

908
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,520
What are you gonna do,
make phone calls here?

909
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,120
Your brother
wants to buy you a drink.

910
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,880
- What time did you say it was again?
- Now?

911
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:24,600
- Yeah.
- Now it's 11:32.

912
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,600
There are developments tonight in the
case of the missing armored car money.

913
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,920
Authorities are saying they're
a step closer to recovering...

914
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,920
$ 1.2 million that
fell out of the armored truck...

915
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,480
a few days ago
near the Port of Philadelphia.

916
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,720
- Now here's Lois Bowden
with the latest details.
- Standing next to me...

917
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,920
is Steve Hrbek
of Liberty Bell Courier.

918
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,840
Steve, what can you tell us?

919
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:50,360
I'd like to take this moment to
officially increase the reward
from $20,000 to $50,000...

920
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:55,920
for any information leading to
the capture and conviction
of Joseph John Coyle.

921
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,200
Again, the new reward
tonight is $50,000.

922
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,360
- Yeah, that's right. $50,000.
- Thank you, Mr. Hrbek.

923
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,720
Right now, police aren't saying much
about this man, Joey Coyle...

924
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,040
who they believe
found the money.

925
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,400
But they have released a police sketch
of what he looks like.

926
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,480
They're describing him
as a white male...

927
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:15,320
age 26, about six feet tall
and weighing 190 pounds.

928
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:18,360
Dark hair and a tattoo
on his right bicep.

929
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,360
If you have any information
on the whereabouts of this man...

930
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,440
you are asked
to contact police.

931
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,040
- Now back to you, Don.
- Thank you, Lois.

932
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,480
The police hot line number
to call if you have any information...

933
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,480
is 555-6023.

934
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,520
In other news tonight,
a massive relief effort is...

935
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,680
underway to help the victims
of new flooding in Bangladesh.

936
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:40,320
- Nearly 10,000...
- Come on, everybody. Belly up.

937
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,240
I'm buying.

938
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,440
Where is he goin'?

939
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,160
I'm Ned Cochran.
C- o...

940
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,560
You can't do this. You can't
sell him out for money.

941
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,800
- C-h-r-a...
- Gimme the phone. Gimme the phone, man.

942
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,920
- You can't do this.
- $50,000...

943
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,680
- buys us each our own row house.
- No! No!

944
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,040
Where's your loyalty,
Ned?

945
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,560
Say it is so, Joey.

946
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:22,520
You are the greatest
in the world!

947
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,720
Don't worry about it, Joe.
We'll keep you out of jail.

948
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,160
You need a place to hide,
you come stay with me anytime, huh?

949
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:33,400
Unless you wanna
come home with me, Joey.

950
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,800
Here's to Joey Coyle.

951
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,320
South Philly's favorite son.

952
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,760
Hey, Joey, how 'bout a little?
My wife's pregnant.

953
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,240
All right, guys, get outta here.

954
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,240
What time do you open...

955
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:22,520
Aaah!

956
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:31,560
Joey? Joey, are you hit?

957
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,880
Get up. Are you all right?

958
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:38,200
- Are you all right? Answer me!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

959
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:43,520
Hey, hey, he's down.
Forget it. He's down.

960
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,640
Goddammit, Joey,
goddammit!

961
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:54,360
All right, go,
you gotta go. Go!

962
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,680
Thanks.

963
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:01,720
Go. I'll take care
of this. Be smart, Joey!

964
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,640
That's him. Stop!

965
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,840
Here. Keep the change.

966
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,760
- Joe!
- You are late.

967
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,240
I'm sorry. I'm so glad
you're still here. Where's the car?

968
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,960
- There.
- You don't know what I had to
go through to get the tickets.

969
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,040
- Yeah, blah, blah. Where's the money?
- You see, I got the money.

970
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,280
- We're going to Nassau
first thing tomorrow morning.
- But where is the money?

971
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,960
- It's in the suitcase.
- I can't go to Long Island.
I gotta get out of the country.

972
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,560
Nassau's in the Bahamas.
It is out of the country.

973
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,560
- It's got friendly banks too.
We need passports to get in.
- Friendly banks?

974
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:32,280
I had to bribe my cousin
Frankie to give me his.

975
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:36,280
- I need coffee.
- Look, give me the keys
and I'll get you coffee.

976
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,480
- You need rest, baby.
- I don't need rest. I need coffee.

977
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,920
Whatever you say.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

978
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,360
I haven't slept
in four days.

979
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:49,240
I need coffee.

980
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,320
- I'll buy you a double espresso.
- I don't need a double espresso,
I need coffee.

981
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,080
The preferred weapon
in South Philadelphia.

982
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:04,440
- Who's firin' off guns in the bathroom?
- All I remember was a...

983
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,440
wham... wham, wham.

984
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,360
That's about it.

985
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:12,080
- And then somebody
smacked you in the head.
- Yeah.

986
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:15,360
- Who was it?
- How the hell would I know?

987
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,480
This kid Kozlowski, he says
you know somethin' about it.

988
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:25,280
I don't know no K-Kowalski,
Kozlowski. I don't know no one.

989
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:29,240
He knows you. And he said you pushed
his car in the river. What about it?

990
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,200
Ow.

991
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:34,600
You know, I could nail you
right now for car theft.

992
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,920
You got nothin'.

993
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:40,760
Me, Dino Palladino,
says to you, you got nothin'.

994
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,120
Lindey,
pour me a drink.

995
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,080
Gimme a C.C.

996
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:55,040
Palladino. Palladino.

997
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:58,920
- Is that with one "L" or two?
- Two L's.

998
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,800
Your parent's used to have a grocery
store on South Street, didn't they?

999
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:08,400
My old man used to sell
wholesale to that store.

1000
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:11,000
- You know me now?
- Laurenzi?

1001
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,560
Yeah.

1002
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:17,240
Yeah, he had the best ravioli
in the city. The very best, man.

1003
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:20,400
- He sure did.
- That's funny.

1004
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,480
- Drink up.
- Hmm.

1005
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,080
Look, Laurenzi.
I didn't need this aggravation.

1006
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:40,000
The putz came to me.
I swear on my mum.

1007
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,960
Can we do a dance here?

1008
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,920
As long as I get
all the money back...

1009
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,800
there's no reason for me to bother you
or any of your friends.

1010
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,400
- No names.
- That's right. No names.

1011
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,720
- You Laurenzi?
- Yeah.

1012
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,400
You got a photo I. D?

1013
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,720
I got somethin' for ya.

1014
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,640
- Where is the coffee?
- Come on, put your head up.

1015
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:51,000
- Come on, Joe. What's your name?
- The fat man.

1016
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:54,240
- What's your name?
- Francis Santos.

1017
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,360
- That's not your name.
- Francis Joseph Santos.

1018
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:01,520
- Date of birth?
- Uh, 5/9/68.

1019
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:06,680
- What's my cousin's date of birth?
- 9/5/68.

1020
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,680
- Occupation?
- I'm a money smuggler.

1021
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,160
- Come on, Joe! Occupation!
- Ow! I'm guy goin' on vacation!

1022
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,120
Look, Joe, come on.
Get it right, all right?

1023
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,080
I don't wanna get caught.
We got one shot here.

1024
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,680
Where you goin'?
You're not counting, are you?

1025
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,120
Monica, do not touch that money
with your hands...

1026
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,080
until we get
the coffee I ordered.

1027
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,000
Joe, just shut up, all right?
I gotta concentrate.

1028
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:28,560
We got plans to make.
I gotta make the plans.

1029
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:31,320
Monica?
Don't count it again.

1030
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,600
Don't do it. Don't count it again.
Monica, Monica, Monica.

1031
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,720
Five, eight, three, four,
nine, three...

1032
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,320
six, eight, two, you know
what I'm sayin', I've been there.

1033
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:42,800
Joe, please. You're makin' me lose my
count, all right? Just order the coffee.

1034
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,720
Hello, room service?

1035
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,200
What do you suppose it's going to take
to get the coffee that I ordered?

1036
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,720
You know what I'm saying?
Because, uh, we have to catch a plane...

1037
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,160
And I can't go to sleep.

1038
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:58,240
What do I want
with my coffee?

1039
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:02,120
Uh, a slice of hope.
Okay?

1040
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:07,160
- Just bring the coffee.
- Joe.

1041
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,200
You just told 'em we're gettin'
on a plane. That was stupid.

1042
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:13,360
We're in an airport hotel. All right?
Everybody here is getting on a plane.

1043
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,520
If I didn't tell them I was
getting on a plane...

1044
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,000
they're gonna call cops and we're
gonna have a cage in the lobby.

1045
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,680
You know what I'm saying?
So just let me handle it.

1046
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:26,680
Now just, just let me rest.

1047
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,720
Joe. Come on.

1048
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,960
- We gotta rinse this stuff.
- In the morning.

1049
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,160
- Come on, you gotta get up.
- Huh-uh.

1050
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,560
Joe, come on.

1051
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:42,040
- Is your scalp burning yet?
- No. No, it feels natural.

1052
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,640
I don't want you to go bald.
Come on, stay up.

1053
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,600
Come on, get up. Keep me up.

1054
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:53,560
Come on, get up.
Come on.

1055
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,800
Get up.

1056
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,040
Come on.

1057
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,720
Get up. Up. Now.

1058
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:05,040
Come on, Joe.

1059
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,040
Where's my money?

1060
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:17,720
It's over there in the fridge.
You mind puttin' that shade back down?

1061
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,640
Money in the fridge.
In the fridge. Here's money.

1062
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,920
Feels light, though.
This is all of my money?

1063
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,120
In a plastic Hefty bag.

1064
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,280
The serial numbers
are sequential.

1065
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,720
This isn't the money
that fell off my truck!

1066
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:37,880
You get money from the Mob,
it's money that needs to be laundered.

1067
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:42,480
Nobody ever said "wise guys"
were dumb, Hrbek.

1068
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,200
You can't allow them
to get away with this.

1069
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:49,080
What do you suggest we do,
give it back? Go ahead. Take it back.

1070
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:53,880
It's f... $440,000...
$440,000?

1071
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:57,600
I had $ 1.2 million.
Where's the rest of my money?

1072
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,120
You know something, Hrbek?
You're a real jerk.

1073
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:08,280
Laurenzi here.

1074
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:17,240
Yeah, I'll be right there.

1075
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,960
What's up?

1076
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,920
What, what?
Who was that?

1077
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,080
Where you goin'?
Laurenzi!

1078
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,760
Laurenzi,
where you goin'?

1079
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:30,960
See Ben Franklin discover electricity
at the Colonial Wax Museum.

1080
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:34,600
See Ben Franklin discover electricity
at the Colonial Wax Museum.

1081
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:38,640
Uh, see Ben Franklin discover electricity
at the Colonial Wax Museum.

1082
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,760
See Ben Franklin discover electricity
at the Colonial...

1083
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:43,240
Don't do this.
Don't do it, all right?

1084
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,720
You don't belong here, do you?
That's all I'm saying.

1085
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,760
That's all I'm saying, okay?
Don't, don't do it.

1086
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,880
It's not fair, all right?
Get out of here. Really.

1087
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,360
- Joe, he's just a guy in a costume.
- It's not fair.

1088
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,000
This is Palladino's car.
They gotta be in there.

1089
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,800
We got five international flights
departing in the next hour.

1090
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,720
We gotta move.
USAir to Nassau.

1091
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,080
Yucatan Air to Cancun.
Air Luxembourg to Brussels.

1092
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:10,760
USAir to Toronto.
And Air Roma to Frankfurt.

1093
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:13,840
Thanks, Miss Russo.
May I see your passport, Mr. Santos?

1094
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:21,560
- Date of birth, please?
- 9/5/68.

1095
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:26,040
It's our custom in the Bahamas
to put the day ahead of the month.

1096
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,320
In the U.S., it's done
the other way around.

1097
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,000
- What month were you born?
- Ninth month.

1098
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:34,680
- Joe, tell him your birthday.
- Excuse me. Who's Joe?

1099
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:38,560
Me. L-I'm Francis Joseph Santos
and she calls me Joe...

1100
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:41,200
so I don't get her confused
with her brother Frankie.

1101
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:44,240
- What month were you born?
- I was born in the ninth month...

1102
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:49,080
of September on the fifth day
of the year of our Lord, 1968.

1103
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:52,400
Okay. Would you put your luggage
on the scale, please?

1104
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:55,440
- It's a carryon.
- That's too big to take on board.

1105
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,920
I'm gonna... I'm-I'm gonna
go to the gift shop.

1106
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,520
Mr. Dan Logan.
Your party is waiting for you...

1107
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,120
Miss Russo.
Don't forget your tickets.

1108
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,920
Thank you.

1109
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,840
Carmine, you take Roma.

1110
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,480
Vicki, Lux Air's down there.
I'm gonna be at Yucatan.

1111
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,320
Along with these candy items,
could I get these hose, please?

1112
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,760
Out of $100.

1113

Okay, that's $4.88.

Thank you very much.

1117
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:39,000
- personal belongings unattended.
- Would you like your receipt?

1118
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,800
Unclaimed luggage
will be removed by security.

1119
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,680
Philadelphia police.

1120
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,080
Suspect not on Yucatan.

1121
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:47,120
Still boarding Air Luxembourg, over.

1122
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,200
Air Roma's delayed.
Engine trouble. Over.

1123
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,320
I'm goin' over
to USAir right now.

1124
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,440
- Where's the suitcase?
- In just a moment...

1127
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:06,160
At this time, we would like to board

1128
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,440
Please step back.

1129
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,880
Do you got any keys,
jewelry, a watch maybe?

1130
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:13,080
It must be my earrings.
This happens all the time. Okay.

1131
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:16,600
- Can I give this to you?
- I'm not sure.
Why don't I let...

1132
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:23,640
- Thanks.
- There you go. Now you.

1133
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:26,120
Yeah, yeah, I have it.

1134
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:28,520
Take off the belt.

1135
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:03,000
The plane is leaving soon.
You don't have to take that
out of your pants right now.

1136
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:06,440
Let me tell you somethin'.
One size does not fit all.

1137
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,840
What are you talking about? I wear
them all the time. Just deal with it.

1138
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:11,440
I understand that you wear them
and what I'm dealing with.

1139
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,520
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Joe, please. Come on.

Thanks.

01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:34,280
And 6-B, sir.

1158
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:44,880
Everybody freeze.
Joseph John Coyle.

1159
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,360
Turn around.
You're under arrest.

1160
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:55,080
I'm Frankie Santos.

1161
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:58,360
I'm a guy who's goin' on vacation.

1162
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,120
- Joey!
- Coyle! It's all over, babe. Don't move.

1163
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:09,960
Drop the bag, honey.
Put the bag down right now.

1164
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:14,240
Drop the bag!
Right now!

1165
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:18,160
Free money!
Run, Joey!

1166
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:23,360
Run!
Joey, run! Go!

1167
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,760
I can't believe
you just did that.

1168
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,480
Run, Joey!

1169
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:38,200
Where?

1170
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:04,680
Walk this way, Coyle.

1171
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:07,760
- How you feelin', Joe?
- Feel pretty good.
A little tired, really.

1172
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:10,200
Out of the way here, please.

1173
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:19,000
Get airport security down
here to clean all this up.

1174
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:23,400
Yeah, airport security? Close off
USAir concourse. The entire concourse.

1175
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:25,320
- Joey!
- They act like they all know you.

1176
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,240
Yeah, it's
a real freak show, huh?

1177
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:29,160
Joey, would you do anything
differently next time?

1178
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:31,400
Yeah, I think I'd go red instead
of yellow and definitely do the eyebrows.

1179
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:34,400
Joey, what advice would you give
to somebody who found that much money?

1180
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:36,880
Eat a good breakfast.
It's gonna be a long day.

1181
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,920
Hey, lady. Were you with him
when he found the money?

1182
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,440
Hey, Joe. I hope
I still have a job.

1183
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:45,000
Mr. Coyle, if you found the money again,
would you still keep it?

1184
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:49,400
Uh... I don't know, you know?
What do you think? Maybe I'd get lucky.

1185
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:53,080
Come on, Joey, people want to know.
Would you really do the same thing again?

1186
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:59,480
I think I definitely would.

1187
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:04,440
And next time I find a million bucks,
I'm gonna know what to do with it.

1188
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:11,080
- Free Joey Coyle!
- Yeah, free Joey Coyle!

1189
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,360
Free Joey Coyle!
Free Joey Coyle!
