183
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,933
How long is this process?

184
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:07,727
Hard to pinpoint exactly,

185
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,313
but if you make it
until the end, nine days.

186
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,565
- So I have nine days.
- Yes.

187
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:13,524
Or less.

188
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:14,567
After that?

189
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,776
If you're selected,

190
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,571
there is an extension as a newborn.

191
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:22,033
If not, I would say it's the end.

192
00:17:22,617 --> 00:17:26,579
By "extension," do you mean
I carry on the memories from here?

193
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:28,956
No. No memories.

194
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:31,417
But you'll still be you.

195
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:34,378
What's the difference between, um,

196
00:17:35,296 --> 00:17:36,255
being here

197
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,257
and being alive?

198
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:43,179
Any feeling, sensation, emotion,

199
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,014
much less intense here.

200
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,724
How can you be so sure of that?

201
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:50,561
Because of a previous experience
as a living person.

202
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,105
So you were picked.

203
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:56,359
You sat where I sat, and you won.

204
00:17:57,026 --> 00:17:57,860
Yes.

205
00:18:01,072 --> 00:18:03,866
And what did you achieve
as a living person?

206
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:10,414
Unfortunately I can't answer
any questions on the subject.

207
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,125
Okay.

208
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:18,589
I have a task for you.

209
00:18:20,841 --> 00:18:23,344
No right or wrong answer.

210
00:18:23,427 --> 00:18:24,303
[door closes]

211
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:27,807
Just say whatever comes to mind.

212
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,476
[Will whistling]

213
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:35,731
You gonna sit there?

214
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,567
From here on, you're not Anne anymore.

215
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:44,448
You are a war prisoner
in a concentration camp.

216
00:18:44,532 --> 00:18:48,911
You were sent here yesterday
with your 11-year-old son, Nick.

217
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,789
Very smart boy, but quite rebellious too.

218
00:18:52,581 --> 00:18:55,710
This morning, Nick tried to escape,

219
00:18:55,793 --> 00:18:57,878
but was caught by a sadistic guard

220
00:18:57,962 --> 00:19:00,339
who wants to hang him.

221
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:01,382
Nick is right here...

222
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,719
standing on this chair,

223
00:19:05,386 --> 00:19:06,721
with a cord...

224
00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:09,557
around his neck.

225
00:19:10,224 --> 00:19:13,686
This small piece of furniture
is the only thing preventing

226
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:15,855
your beloved son from being killed,

227
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:20,025
when the guard says, "Pull the chair."

228
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:23,446
Pull the chair!

229
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,197
Pull the chair! Pull the chair!

230
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:26,741
[laughing] My God.

231
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:29,368
If you don't pull this chair,

232
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,997
not only will I kill your son,

233
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,416
I'll kill everyone else here.

234
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:37,460
Shit. Uh...

235
00:19:48,596 --> 00:19:50,514
Would you pull the chair or not?

236
00:19:53,017 --> 00:19:54,977
No right or wrong answers.

237
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,605
Just say whatever comes to mind.

238
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:02,818
Anne.

239
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:05,488
Uh...

240
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:10,075
I wouldn't pull the chair.

241
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,368
Can you tell me why?

242
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:15,372
Well, if I pull the chair,
my son will die for sure.

243
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,418
But if I don't, there's always
a chance the guard is bluffing.

244
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:20,878
[woman] <i>I would pull the chair.</i>

245
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:21,837
Why?

246
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:23,923
Because I don't care.

247
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:26,842
It's my fault that my son tried to escape,

248
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:30,679
so it wouldn't be fair
if everyone else died because of us.

249
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:31,806
[sighs]

250
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:35,017
I mean, do I have another kid?

251
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:38,354
I'd attack the guard.

252
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:41,649
I'm not sure
if you understand the concept of firearms,

253
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:43,776
but attacking the guard
is a losing battle.

254
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:45,361
Losing battle like what?

255
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,032
Like attacking a bear
with nothing but your hands.

256
00:20:51,408 --> 00:20:54,245
What makes you so sure
I would lose that fight?

257
00:20:54,328 --> 00:20:56,497
Thank you for sharing that with me, Anne.

258
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,251
I think I have everything I need.

259
00:21:00,334 --> 00:21:02,002
I think I have everything I need.

260
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:04,713
Thank you.

261
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:06,799
You're welcome.

262
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:07,967
Thank you.

263
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,426
Oh, thank you.

264
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,470
- I should go.
- Thank you.

265
00:21:13,264 --> 00:21:14,223
I will go.

266
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,642
Unless you want me...
Unless you have more ques...

267
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:18,561
- Mm-mm.
- Nope? All right.

268
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,439
- Other door.
- Yup.

269
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:23,357
Sorry.

270
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:25,985
Still learning the lay of the land.

271
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,739
[Amanda playing emotive music on violin]

272
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,332
[subdued music playing]

273
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:43,210
[tires squealing]

274
00:21:43,794 --> 00:21:44,879
- [Amanda] <i>No!</i>
- [car crashes]

275
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,843
[tires squealing]

276
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:52,636
- [knocking on door]
- [Amanda] <i>No!</i>

277
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,722
[tape rewinding]

278
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:59,393
[tires squealing]

279
00:21:59,476 --> 00:22:00,436
[Amanda] <i>No!</i>

280
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,190
[tape rewinding]

281
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:13,866
[tires squealing]

282
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:14,950
[Amanda] <i>No!</i>

283
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:20,331
[knocking]

284
00:22:20,414 --> 00:22:21,457
Got any tea left?

285
00:22:23,584 --> 00:22:25,419
You just enter the house now.

286
00:22:25,502 --> 00:22:28,547
I can never resist a brew.

287
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:30,341
There's some tea in the kitchen.

288
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:33,802
Got to get back to work.

289
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:34,887
Be my guest.

290
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:39,767
Oh, yeah,
Daniel's got his head deep in pizza.

291
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,852
It's his second one. [laughs]

292
00:22:41,936 --> 00:22:43,062
[chatter on TVs]

293
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:45,814
Jeannine's been on the toilet now
for 25 minutes.

294
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:48,400
She should've never had
the shoyu chicken, you know.

295
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:49,735
[knocking on door]

296
00:22:52,321 --> 00:22:53,697
[knocking continues]

297
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,741
You not gonna get that?

298
00:22:56,617 --> 00:22:58,661
[Will] Everyone else came on time.

299
00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:08,921
[door opens]

300
00:23:12,883 --> 00:23:14,134
[Kyo] Please, come in.

301
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:15,427
I'm Kyo.

302
00:23:15,511 --> 00:23:19,056
- [woman] Nice to meet you, Kyo.
- This is the official entrance.

303
00:23:21,892 --> 00:23:22,768
Welcome.

304
00:23:23,811 --> 00:23:24,645
Please, sit.

305
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:33,779
This is Kyo. He'll be helping me tonight.

306
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:36,240
Yes, we got introduced.

307
00:23:36,323 --> 00:23:37,783
Good. My name is Will.

308
00:23:37,866 --> 00:23:39,618
- May I...
- Nice to meet you, Will.

309
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,708
May I call you Emma?

310
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,423
Any problem?

311
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:53,924
Actually...

312
00:23:56,427 --> 00:23:58,804
May I choose something for myself?

313
00:23:59,346 --> 00:24:02,766
It's just temporary.
If you're selected, you get another name.

314
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,562
But if I'm not selected,
then it is the only one I'll ever have.

315
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:10,858
Pick another name.

316
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:12,526
Anything you want.

317
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:18,073
I like Emma.

318
00:24:22,453 --> 00:24:23,954
Emma it is.

319
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,207
Emma, may I take your picture?

320
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,125
[Emma] Yeah.

321
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,170
That won't be necessary.

322
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,590
Sorry, it's a bit flashy.

323
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,091
Thank you, Kyo.

324
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:37,885
Emma, do you know why you're here?

325
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:38,844
Yes.

326
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:42,723
All right, before we get started,
do you have any questions?

327
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:44,099
Is Kyo your boss?

328
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,017
Whoa. [snickers]

329
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,478
I've never thought of it that way, but no.

330
00:24:48,145 --> 00:24:49,855
I would not hire Will.

331
00:24:49,938 --> 00:24:52,691
- [Emma] So you're an interviewer too?
- He's not allowed to interview.

332
00:24:52,775 --> 00:24:53,609
Why?

333
00:24:54,943 --> 00:24:56,528
Unfortunately, uh,

334
00:24:57,446 --> 00:24:58,822
I've never been alive.

335
00:25:03,243 --> 00:25:04,536
All right.

336
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,580
I have a task for you.

337
00:25:07,331 --> 00:25:09,166
I'll start a story.

338
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:10,876
You tell me how it ends.

339
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:15,005
Just say whatever comes to mind.

340
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,258
Your name is no longer Emma.

341
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:20,219
You are a prisoner of war.

342
00:25:20,302 --> 00:25:23,263
- What kind of war?
- Just listen.

343
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:28,018
You were sent to a concentration camp

344
00:25:29,186 --> 00:25:32,231
with your 11-year-old son, Nick.

345
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:34,983
This morning, Nick tried to escape,

346
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:38,403
but was caught by a sadistic guard
who wants to hang him.

347
00:25:38,946 --> 00:25:40,489
Nick is on this chair,

348
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:43,492
with a cord around his neck.

349
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:47,746
This small piece of furniture
is the only thing keeping your beloved son

350
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,997
from being killed,

351
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:52,626
when the guard says, "Pull the chair!"

352
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,381
Pull the chair!

353
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:04,471
If you don't pull that chair,

354
00:26:04,555 --> 00:26:07,182
not only will I kill your son,

355
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,934
but all the other prisoners here.

356
00:26:09,017 --> 00:26:10,144
Do you want that?

357
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,860
Will, Will.

358
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:22,197
[whispers] Pull the chair.

359
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:36,753
[in normal voice] What would you do?

360
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:40,340
I'm afraid I can't answer that question.

361
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:41,341
Why not?

362
00:26:42,551 --> 00:26:44,970
Well, the way you put it,

363
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:48,015
the guard is gonna kill my son
no matter what I do.

364
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,350
- Correct?
- Correct.

365
00:26:51,435 --> 00:26:52,269
Why?

366
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,897
Because he is a bad man.

367
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,814
Why?

368
00:26:56,398 --> 00:26:58,317
Because that is the way it is.

369
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,821
Because that's the way the story is,
or because that's the way the world is?

370
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:09,620
Would you pull the chair or not?

371
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:15,459
I'm really not sure if I can answer
your question if you don't answer mine.

373
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:22,674
Interesting interviewing style
you got there.

374
00:27:25,302 --> 00:27:27,554
So, what'd you think of her?

375
00:27:27,638 --> 00:27:29,556
She didn't answer my questions.

376
00:27:30,974 --> 00:27:32,434
How bad is that?

377
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,186
Everyone else answered them.

378
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:36,480
Maybe she's more unique
than everyone else.

379
00:27:36,563 --> 00:27:39,441
Or maybe she's most likely
to fall on the battlefield.

380
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:43,070
You always talk as if
you're sending them to war.

381
00:27:43,153 --> 00:27:46,490
You always talk as if
you've been alive to know anything.

382
00:27:46,573 --> 00:27:47,407
Excuse me?

383
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:48,784
You're excused.

384
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:53,789
Listen, Will,
I'm not gonna argue with you again.

385
00:27:54,498 --> 00:27:56,458
Do whatever you want to yourself.

386

Cut your dick off
with a plastic knife if you want.

387
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:01,922
But for the selections, it's my duty

388
00:28:02,005 --> 00:28:04,132
to point out what I saw here, and that...

389
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:06,343
That was unique.

390
00:28:06,426 --> 00:28:08,220
Thanks for the advice.

391
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:09,429

Hey, wonderful.

Congratulations on making it
to the second day.

[Will] This is the kitchen.

- Oh. [laughs]

409

Careful what you say.
Careful what you say.

410
00:29:25,255 --> 00:29:26,631
Oh, look at these guys.

411
00:29:28,383 --> 00:29:29,676
Wanna show you the bathroom.

412
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,220
Yeah, sure, sure. Yeah, love that.

413
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:37,225
[Will] This...

414
00:29:39,186 --> 00:29:40,604
is the bathroom.

415
00:29:41,438 --> 00:29:42,272
Hot.

00:29:42,856 --> 00:29:43,982
Cold.

May I turn it on?

418
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:49,279
Sure.

419
00:30:04,461 --> 00:30:06,838
And this is where
you can see through the eyes

420
00:30:06,922 --> 00:30:09,299

- [chatter & noise on TVs]
- Wow.

422
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,851
What should I do now?

423
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:20,936
Just watch them.

424
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:24,147
And anything you like, write it down.

425
00:30:28,443 --> 00:30:29,361
Can I write anything?

to be when this process is over.

433

Yesterday, you said
I only have nine days.

Did you start counting yesterday,
or did you start counting today?

Yesterday.

00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,286
It's good.

546
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:42,038
Very good.

547
00:39:44,374 --> 00:39:49,212
Is, uh, there anything you didn't like
that you want me to improve?

548
00:39:49,295 --> 00:39:51,089
It's better not to think that way.

549
00:39:52,131 --> 00:39:53,257
What way?

550
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:55,218
I don't want you
to do what I think is right.

551
00:39:55,301 --> 00:39:56,928
I want you to do what's right for you.

552
00:39:57,011 --> 00:39:59,472
Right, but in the end,

553
00:39:59,555 --> 00:40:01,849
you still come and judge me, right?

554
00:40:04,227 --> 00:40:06,145
And how does that make you feel?

555
00:40:07,897 --> 00:40:09,440
How it makes me feel?

556
00:40:10,817 --> 00:40:11,818
Listen, Will.

557
00:40:13,152 --> 00:40:15,863
I only have seven days left here, okay?

558
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:19,075
So I'd appreciate
if you were just straightforward with me.

559
00:40:19,158 --> 00:40:22,203
Just tell me the rules,
I'll play the game.

560
00:40:25,581 --> 00:40:26,416
No.

561
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,751
I'm changing the assignment.

562
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,005
Okay, to what?

563
00:40:32,088 --> 00:40:34,632
I want you
to pick something you don't like.

564
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,844
- A moment I don't like?
- Mm.

565
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,096
Should I write that down too?

566
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:43,141
You could take notes,
but we'll just talk about it.

567
00:40:45,351 --> 00:40:47,353
- I'll work hard on this.
- Mm.

568
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:54,694
[Will] <i>Do you have any questions?</i>

569
00:40:54,777 --> 00:40:58,573
Question? Yeah.
When are we gonna grab a beer together?

570
00:40:58,656 --> 00:40:59,490
A beer?

571
00:40:59,574 --> 00:41:01,951
I saw some bottles in the fridge.
You gotta have a grill.

572
00:41:02,035 --> 00:41:04,412
We can slap some steaks on,
call some chicks.

573
00:41:06,706 --> 00:41:10,084
I'm kind of busy these days,
but thanks for the invite.

574
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:14,964
All right, well,
this was a great conversation.

575
00:41:15,048 --> 00:41:17,050
[alert beeping on TV]

576
00:41:38,821 --> 00:41:39,655
[Mike] Hello?

577
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:43,034
Oh, Mike.

578
00:41:44,452 --> 00:41:46,037
Can you come with me?

579
00:42:09,769 --> 00:42:11,562
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

580
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:14,982
You didn't do anything wrong.

581
00:42:18,277 --> 00:42:19,529
I knew I...

582
00:42:21,197 --> 00:42:22,365
I knew...

583
00:42:23,699 --> 00:42:25,201
that I wasn't good enough.

584
00:42:25,284 --> 00:42:30,289
This has nothing to do
with being good or bad.

585
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:38,464
So this is the end of it.

586
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,927
I guess we never really got started.

587
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,054
Mike.

588
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:52,395
It's not about the time that you spend.

589
00:42:54,689 --> 00:42:56,482
You've been here a few days,

590
00:42:57,024 --> 00:43:00,194
but you've lived every second

591
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:03,072
with honesty and intensity.

592
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,491
There's no shame in that.

593
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,202
Now...

594
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:16,836
I want you to think
of what you saw on those TVs,

595
00:43:17,378 --> 00:43:20,089
and pick a moment
truly meaningful for you.

596
00:43:20,173 --> 00:43:22,884
I know it's not much, but if you allow me,

597
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:26,762
I will do my best to recreate
that moment for your experience.

598
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:32,894
I'm sorry.

599
00:43:34,103 --> 00:43:35,521
Don't be sorry.

600
00:43:39,859 --> 00:43:40,902
You're good.

601
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:42,862
Thank you.

602
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:58,502
[Kyo] I was helping Joan a couple
of weeks back, and she had this candidate.

603
00:43:58,586 --> 00:44:01,631
Ah, this guy, I mean,
he was a right pain in the ass.

604
00:44:01,714 --> 00:44:05,384
Kept banging on like,
"Where? How? Why?" all the time.

605
00:44:05,468 --> 00:44:09,263
And so Joan came up with
this really good argument like,

606
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:12,808
"We don't know, just like
the people in the TVs who don't know."

607
00:44:12,892 --> 00:44:16,270
You know, and that,
to me, was mind-blowing.

608
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:18,731
Maybe there's another parallel dimension

609
00:44:18,814 --> 00:44:21,025
where someone interviewed me,

610
00:44:21,108 --> 00:44:26,280
and she or he sent me here,
and I just can't remember.

611
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:28,157
I mean, can you imagine it?

612
00:44:28,241 --> 00:44:30,701
Right now
there are people sat in their chairs,

613
00:44:30,785 --> 00:44:33,913

laughing at my jokes,

615
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,378
and those people are being watched
by someone else too,

616
00:44:41,837 --> 00:44:43,506

617

who's being watched by someone else,

00:44:46,926 --> 00:44:49,053
who's being watched by someone else.

619
00:44:51,305 --> 00:44:52,807
It's deep, though, innit?

620
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:55,893
Hup.

[hammer banging from other room]

625
00:45:25,965 --> 00:45:27,758
Do you need something?

626
00:45:27,842 --> 00:45:28,718
[Emma] What is this?

627
00:45:29,385 --> 00:45:30,720
It's a last wish.

628
00:45:31,721 --> 00:45:32,722
I don't get it.

629
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:34,932
A candidate was eliminated, so...

630
00:45:35,016 --> 00:45:38,394
I asked if there was a moment
he would like to experience.

631
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:40,271
A last wish.

632
00:45:40,354 --> 00:45:42,315
We're making a moment here.

633
00:45:42,398 --> 00:45:44,692
I can't picture a moment here.

634
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:47,194
Neither can I. Just following orders.

635
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:48,738
Let me help.

636
00:45:48,821 --> 00:45:51,407
[Will] You won't get any extra time
for your assignment.

637
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,784
- I already finished for today.
- [Kyo] You can sand the wood.

638
00:45:53,868 --> 00:45:56,245
I don't have time
to teach her how to sand.

639
00:45:56,329 --> 00:45:57,538
I can figure it out.

640
00:46:01,709 --> 00:46:03,669
[Kyo] Looks like we got a natural here.

641
00:46:09,425 --> 00:46:10,259
Kyo?

642
00:46:10,926 --> 00:46:11,761
Yeah.

643
00:46:11,844 --> 00:46:13,804
If you could pick a moment,

644
00:46:13,888 --> 00:46:15,514
what moment would you pick?

645
00:46:15,598 --> 00:46:16,515
A moment?

646
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:19,310
A moment you'd like to experience.

647
00:46:21,103 --> 00:46:22,563
Okay, don't laugh.

648
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:24,065
I won't.

649
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:24,982
Well,

when they climb the top of the mountain,

652
00:46:30,196 --> 00:46:34,492
they usually yell something out,
so they can hear their voice echoing.

653
00:46:34,575 --> 00:46:35,409
Okay.

654
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:38,037

Is there a moment you'd like to...?

665
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,527
There is no moment.

668
00:47:13,447 --> 00:47:14,657
Enough.

669
00:47:15,991 --> 00:47:17,034
Why do you say that?

00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:19,829
You're the one who's lived. Why say...?

00:47:19,912 --> 00:47:20,746
Enough.

help me take this inside?

673
00:47:29,922 --> 00:47:33,926
[Emma] Does every interviewer do that
for the candidates who get eliminated?

674
00:47:34,009 --> 00:47:35,845
[Kyo] No, only him.

675
00:47:37,096 --> 00:47:38,597
[Emma] What happened to him?

676
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,850
When he was alive?

677
00:47:46,856 --> 00:47:47,731
Will was...

678
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:49,817
special.

679
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:51,735
[Emma] Special how?

680
00:47:53,487 --> 00:47:54,321
Too good.

681
00:47:55,656 --> 00:47:56,615
Too kind.

682
00:47:57,283 --> 00:47:58,784
Too sensitive.

683
00:48:00,327 --> 00:48:02,329
But isn't that a good thing?

684
00:48:04,623 --> 00:48:07,877
When I first saw Will,
he was still in one of those TVs.

685
00:48:09,336 --> 00:48:12,756
Talented, but struggled his whole life

686
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,176
to fit into a world different from him.

687
00:48:16,051 --> 00:48:17,595
Did have love inside him.

688
00:48:19,013 --> 00:48:20,055
Maybe too much.

689
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,809
Too much love, no one to give it to.

690
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:28,272
You know,

691
00:48:29,732 --> 00:48:31,609
we can't do a lot from here,
we really can't,

692
00:48:31,692 --> 00:48:34,778
but there were days
I wished I was with him,

693
00:48:36,363 --> 00:48:39,742
just to let him know
he wasn't alone as he thought he was.

Everything in his favor.

00:49:56,485 --> 00:49:57,486

703
00:49:58,988 --> 00:50:01,407
So he tries again, but more nervous now.

<i>Out.</i>

705
00:50:02,783 --> 00:50:04,118

"He's done it a thousand times.
He'll be all right."

- <i>So close to winning, but...</i>
- [player] <i>Damn it.</i>

712

He let his emotions get in the way.

713
00:50:20,843 --> 00:50:23,220
So in that situation, you would do what?

714
00:50:25,931 --> 00:50:27,182
I'd fight through it.

715
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:28,684

I've been watching this one kid,

723
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:54,376
Rick, for the past few days.

724
00:50:55,669 --> 00:50:56,879
<i>How's it going, man?</i>

725
00:50:57,796 --> 00:50:59,965
And every time I see him,

726
00:51:00,049 --> 00:51:02,343
his classmates are picking on him.

727
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,261
Hurting him, stealing from him.

728
00:51:04,345 --> 00:51:05,888
[boy] <i>We're not pressing that hard.</i>

729
00:51:05,971 --> 00:51:06,805
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>Rick.</i>

730
00:51:07,389 --> 00:51:09,433
I don't like what the kids do to Rick,

731
00:51:09,975 --> 00:51:11,644
but what I really don't like

732
00:51:12,186 --> 00:51:13,520
is what he doesn't do.

733
00:51:14,563 --> 00:51:18,609
He never reacts.
He never does anything. He just takes it.

734
00:51:20,152 --> 00:51:22,279
What would you do in his position?

735
00:51:23,322 --> 00:51:24,573
I would hit back.

736
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,159
So you're justifying violence.

737
00:51:28,535 --> 00:51:29,536
Well, it's not...

738
00:51:30,204 --> 00:51:32,623
It's not violence if you didn't start it.

739
00:51:32,706 --> 00:51:33,707
Then what is it?

740
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,878
Justice.

741
00:51:39,004 --> 00:51:40,214
It's the only way...

742
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:42,383
It's the only way you'd get them to stop.

743
00:51:48,389 --> 00:51:49,223
So?

744
00:51:49,765 --> 00:51:51,392
[Emma] I did what you asked me.

745
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:54,186
And I observed several people.

746
00:51:54,269 --> 00:51:57,690
And I chose one that
I have been watching very closely.

747
00:51:58,357 --> 00:52:00,901
And what don't you like about this person?

748
00:52:04,613 --> 00:52:05,906
He hates himself.

749
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:10,744
He thinks he's a failure,

750
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:15,249
and that everything he does
is worthless and shameful.

751
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:19,378
And no doubt that
he's experienced so much pain

752
00:52:19,461 --> 00:52:23,924
to a point where he felt so much
that today he just wants to feel nothing.

753
00:52:25,801 --> 00:52:30,180
And the numbness,
it makes him feel safe now.

754
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,307
But I know that...

755
00:52:33,809 --> 00:52:36,854
it's really just poisoning
what is left of him.

756
00:52:39,231 --> 00:52:44,611
And deep inside, I think he knows it too.

757
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:48,866
This man...

758
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:52,578
He sounds irreparable.

759
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:55,289
[Emma] He thinks so.

760
00:52:57,374 --> 00:53:00,002
But I know that
there's still something left.

761
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,298
[Kyo] Will.

762
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:07,384
- Sorry to interrupt, but Mike's here.
- [Will] Mm-hm.

763
00:53:07,468 --> 00:53:10,679
Feel free to spend
the rest of your day in the TV room.

764
00:53:19,104 --> 00:53:21,523
[banging from other room]

765
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:27,112
[Kyo speaking indistinctly]

766
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:33,869
Oh, all right. Come in.

767
00:53:49,802 --> 00:53:52,513
Stay here, and no matter what happens,

768
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:54,097
don't let him see you.

769
00:54:52,447 --> 00:54:54,449
[waves crashing]

770
00:55:04,793 --> 00:55:06,879
[quits squawking]

771
00:55:31,236 --> 00:55:33,238
[water splashing]

772
00:55:34,406 --> 00:55:36,450
[children chattering]

773
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:43,707
- [yelling]
- [sound effects stop]

774
00:56:31,004 --> 00:56:33,006
[breathing deeply]

775
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,402
[breathing slows]

776
00:57:19,761 --> 00:57:21,763
[chatter on TVs]

777
00:57:26,768 --> 00:57:28,437
[Will] Thank you for your help.

778
00:57:30,439 --> 00:57:33,442
The candidate really enjoyed the moment.

779
00:57:36,737 --> 00:57:37,988
Glad to hear that.

780
00:58:01,053 --> 00:58:05,891
The man that
you were talking about this afternoon...

781
00:58:12,481 --> 00:58:17,527
In high school,
he was a part of this theater group.

782
00:58:17,611 --> 00:58:19,613
He never liked it.
No one liked him either.

783
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:24,743
Nevertheless...

784
00:58:28,413 --> 00:58:30,791
Two days before the opening night,

785
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:33,919
the main actor, Sam,

786
00:58:34,628 --> 00:58:35,962
got really sick.

787
00:58:37,005 --> 00:58:39,091
He wasn't the best
to replace Sam, for sure,

788
00:58:39,174 --> 00:58:41,551
but he had the best memory in the group,

789
00:58:41,635 --> 00:58:45,972
and Sam's monologues were quite long
to be memorized in such a short time.

790
00:58:47,974 --> 00:58:49,476
So for the next 48 hours,

791
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:53,605
this poor kid read
and reread that monologue,

792
00:58:53,688 --> 00:58:57,067
hundreds upon hundreds
upon hundreds of times,

793
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:59,861
right up until the minute
before the curtains opened.

794
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:02,906
Hands sweating,

795
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:04,908
shaking.

796
00:59:06,993 --> 00:59:10,539
But when he stepped on that stage,
something weird happened.

797
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,837
This warm feeling came to him,
as if he was...

798
00:59:19,381 --> 00:59:21,007
no longer invisible.

799
00:59:23,051 --> 00:59:28,265
He was all over the stage,
becoming one with all those watching,

800
00:59:28,348 --> 00:59:31,143
and the words vibrating everywhere,

801
00:59:31,226 --> 00:59:33,562
yet no longer coming from him,
but through him,

802
00:59:33,645 --> 00:59:36,022
as if his body was nothing but a vessel.

803
00:59:37,816 --> 00:59:41,194
He can't explain it even looking back now.

804
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:43,280
[poignant music playing]

805
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:50,579
A glimpse of something
he'd never touched before...

806
00:59:56,668 --> 00:59:58,336
and would never touch again.

807
01:00:00,505 --> 01:00:03,842
That's the moment
he would like to experience again?

808
01:00:03,925 --> 01:00:04,759
No.

809
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,720
Not at all.

810
01:00:09,222 --> 01:00:10,056
Why?

811
01:00:11,183 --> 01:00:12,017
Because...

812
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:15,395
it would make him feel alive again.

813
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:29,868
I'm telling you this
because I think you've got talent.

814
01:00:32,037 --> 01:00:34,706
But if you really want to survive that,

815
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:37,876
you're going to need to become tougher.

816
01:00:42,047 --> 01:00:45,008
Tougher than this man ever was.

817
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,893
And how do I know

818
01:00:56,061 --> 01:00:57,812
the man is telling the truth,

819
01:00:58,396 --> 01:01:02,150
now that I find out
he was once a great actor?

820
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:15,705
[music continues]

821
01:01:52,367 --> 01:01:53,368
[woman trills on-screen]

822
01:01:53,451 --> 01:01:55,787
[Will] Then I searched
through her adult life,

823
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:57,706
and I couldn't find anything either.

824
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:01,167
There were bad moments,
but she always handled them really well.

825
01:02:04,212 --> 01:02:05,297
Now look at this.

826
01:02:06,381 --> 01:02:08,258
She got the violin to the car.

827
01:02:08,341 --> 01:02:10,302
If she wasn't driving
to the concerto that day,

828
01:02:10,385 --> 01:02:12,387
why would she take the violin with her?

829
01:02:13,138 --> 01:02:15,140
One thing stood out to me, though.

830
01:02:17,892 --> 01:02:20,478
You probably remember
that she rarely cried.

831
01:02:20,562 --> 01:02:21,938
No tears, nothing.

832
01:02:22,022 --> 01:02:23,315
She never let it out.

833
01:02:23,398 --> 01:02:25,108
The only time she did that...

834
01:02:27,027 --> 01:02:29,029
[playing emotive music]

835
01:02:33,074 --> 01:02:35,243
...was when she played the violin.

836
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:39,873
It makes me wonder
if there was a part of her

837
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:41,583
that she was always hiding,

838
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:44,669
like something that she never showed,

839
01:02:44,753 --> 01:02:47,047
that we never saw, because...

840
01:02:47,672 --> 01:02:49,382
Why are you doing this, Will?

841
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:57,599
- Just trying to figure out what happened.
- We can't figure out what happened there.

842
01:02:57,682 --> 01:02:58,641
[video stops]

843
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:01,478
I need to know.

844
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:03,480
Why?

845
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,152
Because it's my duty to know for a fact.

846
01:03:09,235 --> 01:03:11,988
Your duty is to choose someone,

847
01:03:12,072 --> 01:03:15,575
and mine is to make sure
you chose well, in my opinion.

848
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:18,953
And in my opinion,

849
01:03:19,037 --> 01:03:21,331
she was the best choice.

850
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:25,668
No matter if she did it on purpose or not.

851
01:03:26,795 --> 01:03:27,879
You feel the same?

852
01:03:32,258 --> 01:03:34,094
[tape clatters]

853
01:03:35,887 --> 01:03:37,889
[tapes clattering]

854
01:03:39,933 --> 01:03:40,767
Will.

855
01:03:48,149 --> 01:03:49,150
See you tomorrow.

856
01:03:49,234 --> 01:03:51,236
[pensive music playing]

857
01:04:05,917 --> 01:04:07,293
[Rick] <i>Come on, let me go.</i>

858
01:04:08,628 --> 01:04:09,671
<i>Let me go.</i>

859
01:04:09,754 --> 01:04:11,131
What would you do?

860
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:12,465
[Rick] <i>Come on.</i>

861
01:04:13,091 --> 01:04:14,384
I would talk to them.

862
01:04:15,009 --> 01:04:16,344
[Rick] <i>Let me go. Come on, guys.</i>

863
01:04:16,428 --> 01:04:17,929
That's not going to work.

864
01:04:18,012 --> 01:04:18,847
[Rick] <i>Come on.</i>

865
01:04:20,974 --> 01:04:22,600
I would talk to them again.

866
01:04:25,645 --> 01:04:29,441
[Will] You find a wallet in the street
with 500 dollars in it.

867
01:04:29,524 --> 01:04:30,525
What do you do?

868
01:04:30,608 --> 01:04:34,362
I'd take the money,
but I'd donate half of it to charity.

869
01:04:36,281 --> 01:04:38,658
Why do you donate half of it to charity?

870
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:41,494
So you don't ask me why I took the money.

871
01:04:43,455 --> 01:04:47,375
[Will] Your mother makes cookies
for your brother, but not for you.

872
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:49,961
What do you do?

873
01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:55,842
There's gonna be a delicious spit glaze
on them, I'll tell you that much.

874
01:04:57,552 --> 01:04:59,637
My God. That's about to bite.

875
01:04:59,721 --> 01:05:01,306
[relaxing pop music playing on-screen]

876
01:05:01,389 --> 01:05:02,599
[Alex] Hey.

877
01:05:03,183 --> 01:05:05,560
That's what I'm talking about.

878
01:05:17,363 --> 01:05:19,324
[Will] Look what I found in the fridge.

879
01:05:19,407 --> 01:05:23,077
[Alex] Hey, all right. [chuckles]

880
01:05:24,078 --> 01:05:24,996
Okay.

881
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:28,249
Hey.

882
01:05:29,876 --> 01:05:31,586
To our six-day friendship.

883
01:05:40,053 --> 01:05:41,387
Only three more to go.

884
01:05:48,561 --> 01:05:49,854
Ah, that's nice.

885
01:05:54,025 --> 01:05:56,277
[Will] You learn
you have six months to live.

886
01:05:56,361 --> 01:05:57,195
What do you do?

887
01:05:57,278 --> 01:05:58,279
I travel the world.

888
01:05:58,363 --> 01:05:59,364
[Will] <i>What do you do?</i>

889
01:05:59,447 --> 01:06:02,075
I empty our bank accounts
and call a divorce attorney.

890
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:04,953
- What do you do?
- I get a ride with one of my coworkers.

891
01:06:05,036 --> 01:06:06,329
[Will] <i>What do you do?</i>

892
01:06:06,412 --> 01:06:07,539
I poison him.

893
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:13,586
Here are the rest of the tests.

894
01:06:14,754 --> 01:06:15,630
Thank you.

895
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:23,179
Will.

896
01:06:23,263 --> 01:06:24,097
Yes.

897
01:06:25,431 --> 01:06:26,933
Yes, Maria.

898
01:06:31,062 --> 01:06:32,105
I, uh...

899
01:06:35,275 --> 01:06:37,485
Oh, I think I forgot.

900
01:06:43,116 --> 01:06:45,201
Well, if you remember,
I'll be in the other room.

901
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:46,703
Thank you.

902
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:03,428
[knocks]

903
01:07:05,346 --> 01:07:07,348
I left my assignment on the desk.

904
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:09,058
Thank you, Maria.

905
01:07:20,945 --> 01:07:23,573
[pensive music playing]

906
01:07:31,122 --> 01:07:33,124
[paper rustling]

907

[music continues]

908
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:07,283
[knocking on door]

909
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:15,875
Hi, Will. This is Colleen.
Colleen, this is Will.

910
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:18,753
Nice to meet you, Will.
Kyo talked a lot about you.

911
01:08:18,836 --> 01:08:20,755
Wish I could say the same.

912
01:08:20,838 --> 01:08:21,923
Can we come in?

913
01:08:22,006 --> 01:08:22,965
Who is she?

914
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:25,343
Colleen's an interviewer too.

915
01:08:25,426 --> 01:08:27,345
A great one, just like you.

916
01:08:27,428 --> 01:08:30,390
So you just bring all the other
interviewers to my house now?

917
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:32,350
Well, by coincidence, uh,

918
01:08:32,433 --> 01:08:35,645
she chose someone
who knew someone you chose.

919
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,439
As in, they knew each other
in the real world?

920
01:08:38,523 --> 01:08:39,357
Yeah.

921
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:41,609
Small real world, isn't it?

922
01:08:43,611 --> 01:08:44,737
Who did you choose?

923
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:46,364
Cecily.

924
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,741
Amanda's cousin.

925
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:50,076
[girls giggling]

926
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,787
[Colleen] <i>You know,
they were so close at that time.</i>

927
01:08:53,955 --> 01:08:55,873
<i>I always remember Amanda and Cecily</i>

928
01:08:55,957 --> 01:08:58,501
watching that
cartoon together after school.

929
01:08:58,584 --> 01:09:01,087
The one with that purple talking horse.

930
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:04,006
What was the name of that show?
Uh, "Fire" something.

931
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:05,091
<i>The Wildfire.</i>

932
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:08,970
[Colleen] Yes, <i>The Wildfire.</i>
Cecily was crazy about that one.

933
01:09:09,053 --> 01:09:11,931
She had like five shoeboxes
filled with all the toys.

934
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:16,644
You know, the horses,
the girl, the king, the queen.

935
01:09:16,728 --> 01:09:18,229
Except, uh...

936
01:09:18,312 --> 01:09:19,564
Lady Diabolyn.

937
01:09:19,647 --> 01:09:20,606
[Colleen] Yes.

938
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,734
Only Amanda had that one.

939
01:09:22,817 --> 01:09:24,193
[Will] Only Amanda.

940
01:09:24,277 --> 01:09:25,945
Forget how she got it.

941
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:28,448
She played for
one of the composers of the show.

942
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:29,782
[Colleen sighs] That kid.

943
01:09:31,284 --> 01:09:33,244
You must be very proud of her.

944
01:09:34,787 --> 01:09:37,874
You know, like you,
I've been alive too, and it's...

945
01:09:37,957 --> 01:09:39,959
Let's not talk about me, shall we?

946
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:04,692
[Colleen] They found this
after Amanda died.

947
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,916
[Will mumbling]

948
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,474
I didn't see her write it.

949
01:10:36,557 --> 01:10:40,061
Sometimes it's hard
to keep track of all of them.

950
01:10:40,144 --> 01:10:41,854
[Kyo] You can't record everything.

951
01:10:42,396 --> 01:10:43,231
Just go.

952
01:10:43,773 --> 01:10:44,899
Please, just...

953
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:46,484
Just go.

954
01:10:46,984 --> 01:10:50,863
I'm sorry it's hard to hear.
I just want you to move on.

955
01:10:50,947 --> 01:10:51,948
Out.

956
01:10:52,657 --> 01:10:53,699
Just give him some time.

957
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:56,160
You know how hard it is
for me to watch you do...

958
01:10:56,244 --> 01:10:57,453
Get out!

959
01:11:12,593 --> 01:11:14,595
[chatter on TVs]

960
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:16,806
[Will] She didn't do this.

961
01:11:17,348 --> 01:11:18,641
She didn't do this.

962
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:21,602
She didn't do this.

963
01:11:21,686 --> 01:11:23,688

Is this Fernando?

977
01:12:54,904 --> 01:12:55,738
Yes.

978
01:12:57,073 --> 01:13:00,618
If you were this person
in that situation, what would you do?

979
01:13:03,496 --> 01:13:04,330
Emma?

980
01:13:06,832 --> 01:13:08,292
I need you to answer.

981
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:12,004
I don't know the answer.

982
01:13:12,088 --> 01:13:13,214
How could you know?

983
01:13:17,134 --> 01:13:20,096
- If I could be there in that situation...
- That's not possible.

984
01:13:20,179 --> 01:13:22,473
Yes, I know,
but that's why I can't give you an answer.

985
01:13:22,556 --> 01:13:24,475
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

986
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:26,644
What would you do?

987
01:13:27,812 --> 01:13:28,813
I don't know.

01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,740

What would you do?

995
01:14:09,895 --> 01:14:13,149
I wouldn't think twice.
The moment he moved, he'd be dead.

[Will] So,

999
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:31,667
what would you do?

1000
01:14:33,377 --> 01:14:34,336
I don't know.

1001
01:14:35,129 --> 01:14:35,963
I don't know.

1002
01:14:36,047 --> 01:14:38,174
I can't even understand
what they're saying.

1003
01:14:38,257 --> 01:14:41,927
- [Will] You think it's funny?
- No, it's just a joke. It's just a joke.

1004
01:14:42,011 --> 01:14:44,013
- [Will] It's a joke for you?
- No, it...

Come on, this is heavy shit,

heavy shit,

1007
01:14:47,892 --> 01:14:50,478
and I don't understand
why we can't just relax.

1008
01:14:51,312 --> 01:14:53,230
This is so tense.

1009
01:14:56,025 --> 01:14:57,401

Come on.

1012

[Will] If you were in this situation,
what would you do?

1013
01:15:04,241 --> 01:15:06,660
[Alex] I don't understand
why this is necessary.

1014
01:15:07,244 --> 01:15:08,454
This is pain.

1015
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:13,918
What you're feeling right now is nothing
compared to what people feel when alive.

1016
01:15:14,001 --> 01:15:14,919
Stop.

1017
01:15:15,002 --> 01:15:17,254
[wincing]

1018
01:15:31,936 --> 01:15:32,770
Is this...

1019
01:15:37,441 --> 01:15:39,235
Is this because of what I wrote to you?

1020
01:15:39,777 --> 01:15:40,611
No.

1021
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:43,114
It isn't.

1022
01:15:45,866 --> 01:15:47,952
I knew
I shouldn't have written that letter.

1023
01:15:49,954 --> 01:15:51,705
But something inside me...

1024
01:15:54,166 --> 01:15:55,835
I couldn't stop it.

1025
01:15:58,170 --> 01:15:59,547
So I thought that...

1026
01:16:01,549 --> 01:16:04,718
maybe it meant something.

1027
01:16:06,303 --> 01:16:07,805
That maybe you felt

1028
01:16:09,014 --> 01:16:10,432
the same way.

1029
01:16:10,516 --> 01:16:13,144
I'm sorry if you misunderstood, Maria.

1030
01:16:21,527 --> 01:16:24,321
I would like for you
to write down a moment truly meaningful...

1031
01:16:24,405 --> 01:16:25,739
I had a chance.

1032
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:32,079
I had a chance, but I threw it away.

I have to get back to work.

1045
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:43,794
Sorry to keep you waiting, Alex.

1046
01:18:43,877 --> 01:18:44,795
It's all right.

1047

I wanted to apologize for yesterday.

1048
01:18:50,467 --> 01:18:52,553
Come on, Will, it was my fault too.

1049
01:18:52,636 --> 01:18:55,264
I should've taken your question
a little more seriously.

1050
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:57,641
I also wanted to thank you

1051

for everything that
you've been doing here.

1052
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:03,772
Oh.

1053
01:19:03,856 --> 01:19:06,400
That's nice to hear.
I've had... It's my pleasure.

But I have to tell you that...

1057
01:19:12,531 --> 01:19:14,199
What do you have to tell me?

1058
01:19:16,035 --> 01:19:19,913
I have to tell you that you
don't fit the vacancy you're applying for.

1059
01:19:26,086 --> 01:19:27,129
And that means?

1060
01:19:27,212 --> 01:19:28,839
I'm not choosing you, Alex.

1061
01:19:31,383 --> 01:19:35,137
But thank you for all your hard work
and dedication over the past eight days.

Please, I'm just...
If you could just give me one more chance.

1064

I just want one more chance.
That's it. That's all I need.

1065
01:19:45,939 --> 01:19:49,693
- There's nothing I can do.
- Just one more chance.

I know you were pissed yesterday,

1067

and I'm telling you,
I promise that won't happen again.

1068

- That's not it.
- That's what I'm telling you.

That's not it.

1070

Then what is it?

What is it?

1072
01:20:02,873 --> 01:20:05,125
I'm asking for another chance.

1073
01:20:05,209 --> 01:20:07,252
You can't do that for a friend?

1074
01:20:07,336 --> 01:20:08,879
I thought we were friends.

1075
01:20:10,339 --> 01:20:12,383

1076

- I'll do my best to recreate that moment.
- Please.

1078
01:20:25,229 --> 01:20:26,939
Please, Will. Please.

1079
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,817
I made my decision.

1080
01:20:30,401 --> 01:20:31,318
I'm sorry.

1081
01:20:40,536 --> 01:20:41,787
God, you're pathetic.

1082
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:49,461
You stay in this house,
and you judge everyone

1083
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:51,171
and everything,

1084
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,549
but what have you done, huh?

1085
01:20:54,258 --> 01:20:57,219
What have you done?
Who the fuck are you to judge us?

1086
01:20:59,138 --> 01:21:01,140
[Alex chuckling]

1087
01:21:04,017 --> 01:21:05,144
You're afraid.

1088
01:21:07,521 --> 01:21:08,564
You're afraid.

1089
01:21:11,275 --> 01:21:13,777
And you want everybody else
to be afraid too.

1090
01:21:13,861 --> 01:21:15,070
That's it, isn't it?

1091
01:21:16,738 --> 01:21:17,573
Not me.

1092
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:22,035
I'm not jumping on that train, man.

1093
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:30,669
[chair scrapes floor]

1094
01:21:35,299 --> 01:21:36,717

[Maria breathing raggedly]

1100
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:23,175
[Maria] Will.

1101
01:24:23,258 --> 01:24:24,259
[Will] It's okay.

1102
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:27,304
[Maria] Please.

1103
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:30,349
Please, please.

1104
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:33,226
- Don't let me go. Please, don't let me go.
- It's okay.

1105
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:36,772
- Please, don't let me go.
- It's okay.

1106
01:24:36,855 --> 01:24:39,566
- Please, don't let me go.
- It's okay.

1107
01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:42,819
- I don't want to go. I don't want to go.
- It's okay.

1108
01:24:42,903 --> 01:24:45,280
- I don't want to go.
- Shh.

[chatter on TVs]

1113
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:54,641
I thought I told you
to dismiss her for today.

1114
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:57,561
I'm sorry. I forgot.

1115
01:26:01,732 --> 01:26:02,941
She doesn't fit.

1116
01:26:03,024 --> 01:26:05,360
Why do you keep her in the house, then?

1117
01:26:06,111 --> 01:26:08,238
- Hmm?
- All right.

1118
01:26:09,239 --> 01:26:11,032
I'll eliminate her tonight.

1119
01:26:11,116 --> 01:26:12,951
What? Why?

1120
01:26:13,034 --> 01:26:15,287
She didn't show me
what I needed to see from her.

1121
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:18,081
Let me guess. You want her to be tough?
Maybe kill someone?

1122
01:26:18,165 --> 01:26:20,751
[Will] You want me
to pick another prey like I did before.

1123
01:26:20,834 --> 01:26:21,752
A prey?

1124
01:26:22,461 --> 01:26:25,464
[from other room]
Prey? What the fuck are you talking about?

1125
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:29,092
Last week Amanda was your pride and joy.
Now she's a failure?

1126
01:26:29,176 --> 01:26:30,385
She's not a failure.

1127
01:26:31,928 --> 01:26:33,680
You wouldn't understand, because you're...

1128
01:26:33,764 --> 01:26:35,640
- Because I've never been alive?
- Yes.

1129
01:26:35,724 --> 01:26:38,477
- That what you're gonna say?
- Yes, that's what I was going to say.

1130
01:26:39,478 --> 01:26:43,106
You know, what I hate most about you is
that look in your eyes

1131
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:47,444
as if you think you knew everything when
you just shat on the opportunity you had.

1132
01:26:47,527 --> 01:26:48,820
[Will] "Opportunity."

1133
01:26:53,658 --> 01:26:54,826
I hope you have it.

1134
01:26:56,661 --> 01:27:00,749
- So you can stop this nonsense jealousy.
- [Kyo] I'm not jealous.

1135
01:27:00,832 --> 01:27:02,167
You can't even see it.

1136
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:05,253
It's not about me or you.
It's about giving her a chance.

1137
01:27:05,879 --> 01:27:06,713
Great.

1138
01:27:08,215 --> 01:27:09,841
That's a great idea.

1139

and other people send pigs to eat them.

[clattering on TV]

1144
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:31,029
He reacted.

- [Rick] <i>I'm gonna fucking kill you.</i>
- [boy] <i>Fuck.</i>

All right.

1157
01:29:20,847 --> 01:29:22,515
Why do you think she did it?

1158
01:29:24,392 --> 01:29:27,145
She's dead, Will. Why's it matter?

1159
01:29:27,228 --> 01:29:29,356
Twenty-eight years watching her,

1160
01:29:29,439 --> 01:29:31,691
and I couldn't see a warning sign.

1161
01:29:34,486 --> 01:29:37,906
Even if you saw all the signs,
what could you do from here?

1162
01:29:37,989 --> 01:29:39,032
Nothing.

1163
01:29:39,115 --> 01:29:40,533
I couldn't do anything.

1164
01:29:41,159 --> 01:29:45,038
All I can do is send them
to that shithole and say, "Survive it."

1165
01:29:45,121 --> 01:29:47,874
- It's a shithole?
- It's a shithole.

1166
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:49,167
- Hole full of shit.
- Yeah.

1167
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:50,377
I get the metaphor.

1168
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:51,962
Because you're smart.

1169
01:29:52,045 --> 01:29:53,880
Very smart, Kyo, and I'm dumb.

1170
01:29:53,964 --> 01:29:57,008
Very, very dumb.
Couldn't even see it when I chose her.

1171

See what?

1172
01:30:06,643 --> 01:30:08,269
That she's just like me.

1173
01:30:11,731 --> 01:30:14,484
You had great potential, Will.
You know that.

1174
01:30:14,567 --> 01:30:15,819
Potential for what?

1175
01:30:16,403 --> 01:30:17,404
To fail?

1176
01:30:17,487 --> 01:30:18,655
To give up?

1177
01:30:21,658 --> 01:30:23,827
What about the good memories? Huh?

1178
01:30:24,577 --> 01:30:28,248
Good memories, bad memories,
they're all just the same right now.

1179

It still hurts...

in a way that
no one can see and only I can feel.

1181

And now...

1182
01:30:43,972 --> 01:30:44,931
Now what?

1183
01:30:47,976 --> 01:30:50,061

I have to go back now.
Please, take a seat.

1200
01:32:47,512 --> 01:32:48,346
[Emma] Yeah.

1201
01:32:51,182 --> 01:32:52,100
Are you afraid?

1202
01:32:54,018 --> 01:32:54,853
Of what?

1203
01:32:57,814 --> 01:32:59,649
What might happen.

1204
01:33:02,443 --> 01:33:03,278
No.

1205
01:33:05,071 --> 01:33:05,905
Are you?

1206
01:33:11,911 --> 01:33:12,912
I think so.

1207
01:33:15,123 --> 01:33:18,168
I saw this a few years ago, and it just...
[inhales sharply]

1208

Ooh, it just gives me the shivers.

1209
01:33:20,044 --> 01:33:23,047
I'm watching this girl
as she's driving back home,

1210
01:33:23,131 --> 01:33:24,424
pissed out of her head,

1211
01:33:24,507 --> 01:33:27,260
and her mate's in the back,
completely wasted.

1212
01:33:27,343 --> 01:33:31,181
Then, boom, car passes over the bump.

1213
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:33,725
Her mate wakes up, desperate to puke.

[in garbled voice]
"Stop the car. Stop the car.”

1217
01:33:40,648 --> 01:33:42,692
[in normal voice]
And mate just keeps driving.

1218
01:33:42,775 --> 01:33:43,902
What does he do?

1219
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:46,821
He pukes, but in his mouth.

1220
01:33:46,905 --> 01:33:48,114
[gags]

1221
01:33:48,198 --> 01:33:50,783
He's trying to keep her mom's car clean,

1222
01:33:50,867 --> 01:33:53,953
so he heroically swallows everything back.

1223
01:33:54,579 --> 01:33:55,788
[Emma laughs]

1224
01:33:55,872 --> 01:33:58,249
And the taste is so fucking bad.

1225
01:33:58,333 --> 01:34:00,627
And as this puke is going down,

1226
01:34:00,710 --> 01:34:03,379
it just starts coming back up again.

1227
01:34:03,463 --> 01:34:05,089
And now he's swallowing it.

1228
01:34:05,173 --> 01:34:07,300
- Puking, swallowing it.
- [Emma] No.

1229
01:34:07,383 --> 01:34:10,470
She's driving to get back home.
He opens the door.

1232
01:34:23,524 --> 01:34:24,734
It's your go, champ.

1233
01:34:25,318 --> 01:34:26,152
[Kane] What?

1234
01:34:26,236 --> 01:34:29,072
A story more disgusting than mine.

1235
01:34:32,033 --> 01:34:33,868
I don't have a story like that.

1236
01:34:36,454 --> 01:34:37,372
Oh...

1237
01:34:39,374 --> 01:34:40,208
All right.

1238
01:34:41,918 --> 01:34:43,836
It's not a puke story, but, um...

1239
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:47,298
A few days ago, I was watching the news

1240
01:34:47,382 --> 01:34:49,968
of two middle-school girls
who went missing.

1241
01:34:50,843 --> 01:34:52,720
Everybody started looking for them.

1242
01:34:52,804 --> 01:34:54,597
Initially their parents
were really hopeful

1243
01:34:54,681 --> 01:34:57,850
that it was just a prank
or something, right?

1244
01:34:58,977 --> 01:35:00,478
Well, two days later,

1245
01:35:00,561 --> 01:35:02,939
the authorities found out
that they were dead.

1246
01:35:04,107 --> 01:35:05,024
Turned out that

1247
01:35:05,108 --> 01:35:09,988
their 60-year-old English schoolteacher
raped and murdered those girls

1248
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:11,948
and then buried them in his backyard.

1249
01:35:12,031 --> 01:35:15,660
Now, when the police
asked him why he did it,

1250
01:35:16,828 --> 01:35:17,787
he said, um,

1251
01:35:19,455 --> 01:35:21,416
because he was in love with them.

1252
01:35:25,962 --> 01:35:27,630
That was fucking disgusting.

1253
01:35:28,631 --> 01:35:31,926
I don't think that was the type
of disgusting he was referring to.

1254
01:35:32,468 --> 01:35:35,763
[Kane] No, but it's what
I find disgusting.

1255
01:35:38,266 --> 01:35:39,100
Okay.

1256
01:35:40,810 --> 01:35:43,813
I'm just curious why you decided
to bring up this isolated case...

1257
01:35:43,896 --> 01:35:45,606
- Isolated case?
- [Emma] Mm-hm.

1258
01:35:45,690 --> 01:35:47,775
What do you mean?
Stuff like that happens all the time.

1259
01:35:47,859 --> 01:35:49,360
- All the time?
- [Kane] Yeah.

1260
01:35:50,278 --> 01:35:51,821
I feel like you're bringing up
an exception.

1261
01:35:51,904 --> 01:35:55,283
An exception? Are you kidding me?
What world have you been watching?

1262
01:35:55,366 --> 01:35:57,118
The same world you've been watching.

1263
01:35:57,201 --> 01:35:58,369
[Kane] I don't think you have.

1264
01:35:58,453 --> 01:36:01,706
Every single day,
someone hurts someone else.

1265
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:04,500
Every single day,
someone takes someone else's life.

1266
01:36:04,584 --> 01:36:06,461
Every single day,
someone takes their own life.

1267
01:36:06,544 --> 01:36:07,795
Why are you focusing on that?

1268
01:36:07,879 --> 01:36:09,839
Why are you not focusing on that?

1269
01:36:09,922 --> 01:36:13,760
Emma, why don't you tell us
your disgusting story?

1270
01:36:14,344 --> 01:36:15,178
Okay.

1271
01:36:16,095 --> 01:36:16,929
Um...

1272
01:36:18,931 --> 01:36:21,601
Two days ago, I was watching a young woman

1273
01:36:21,684 --> 01:36:24,187
who happened
to have a big poop clogging her toilet.

1274
01:36:24,270 --> 01:36:25,938
[Kyo] I like the premise. Go on.

1275
01:36:26,022 --> 01:36:28,858
So she kept trying to flush it,

1276
01:36:28,941 --> 01:36:30,651
but it would just stay there.

1277
01:36:30,735 --> 01:36:33,446
Until she brought a guy to her apartment.

1278
01:36:33,529 --> 01:36:36,449
And, of course, the first thing
he wanted to do was use her bathroom.

1279
01:36:36,532 --> 01:36:39,911
So she freaked out.
She was like, "Just give me a minute."

1280
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:43,122
She ran in there, locked the door.
She opens a new toothbrush.

1281
01:36:43,206 --> 01:36:49,962
And then she begins
to rub that gigantic mass of poop.

1282
01:36:50,046 --> 01:36:51,089
[Kyo snickers]

1283
01:36:51,172 --> 01:36:55,843
And she rubs it, and rubs it, and rubs it,

1284
01:36:55,927 --> 01:36:58,554
until the bowl is sparkling clean.

1285
01:36:59,472 --> 01:37:03,101
Later on, they were spooning,
and he whispers in her ear,

1286
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:07,438
"Babe, thank you so much
for leaving me that toothbrush.

1287
01:37:07,522 --> 01:37:10,149
I really love the soft ones."

1288
01:37:10,233 --> 01:37:11,776
[Kyo] Oh, God.

1289
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:13,444
Is that it?

1290
01:37:13,528 --> 01:37:17,281
No, because five minutes
before he told her that,

1291
01:37:17,365 --> 01:37:18,866
they were passionately making out.

1292
01:37:22,995 --> 01:37:24,997
[Emma & Kyo laughing]

1293
01:37:53,192 --> 01:37:55,194
[footsteps approaching]

1294
01:37:58,030 --> 01:37:58,948
[door closes]

1295
01:38:13,963 --> 01:38:17,049
[Will] Now that you've had the chance
to get to know each other,

1296
01:38:17,592 --> 01:38:20,011
possibly see some things maybe I haven't,

1297
01:38:20,553 --> 01:38:22,430
I have a simple request.

1298
01:38:23,014 --> 01:38:26,851
I would like for you to tell me
why the person sitting next to you

1299
01:38:27,852 --> 01:38:29,520
doesn't deserve to be alive.

1300
01:38:41,449 --> 01:38:42,783
Who wants to start?

1301
01:38:53,794 --> 01:38:54,837
[door opens]

1302
01:38:58,132 --> 01:39:00,134
[downcast music playing]

1303
01:39:08,518 --> 01:39:12,647
[Will] <i>I have to tell you that you don't
fit the position you're applying for.</i>

1304
01:39:14,982 --> 01:39:18,027
<i>I know it's not easy
to receive this kind of news,</i>

1305
01:39:18,694 --> 01:39:22,490
<i>but I would like for you
to take advantage of the remaining hours</i>

1306
01:39:22,573 --> 01:39:26,077
<i>to write down
a moment truly meaningful for you.</i>

1307
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:32,083
It's not much.

1308
01:39:33,584 --> 01:39:36,087
But if you allow me, I will do my best

1309
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:39,257
to recreate
that moment for your experience.

1310
01:39:47,098 --> 01:39:48,558
You can take your time.

1311
01:39:57,858 --> 01:39:59,569
You have to choose something else.

1312
01:40:00,111 --> 01:40:02,446
But I can't think of anything else.

1313
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:10,788
I'm sorry.

1314
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:23,009
[Will] Some hours
after you leave the house,

1315
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:26,637
you'll feel it,
as if you weren't here anymore

1316
01:40:26,721 --> 01:40:29,640
and your senses were
becoming unbearably sharper...

1317
01:40:31,642 --> 01:40:32,685
and stronger.

1318
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:35,688
It's your new beginning.

1319
01:40:38,691 --> 01:40:40,192
You'll never remember me,

1320
01:40:41,110 --> 01:40:42,987
or anything else
that happened in this place,

1321
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:47,325
but as I said before, you'll still be you.

1322
01:40:54,498 --> 01:40:55,541
Thank you.

1323
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:59,378
There's nothing to thank me for.

1324
01:41:05,593 --> 01:41:07,303
I'm really sorry about Emma.

1325
01:41:17,605 --> 01:41:18,564
Um...

1326
01:41:19,106 --> 01:41:20,733
Emma's here to say goodbye.

1327
01:41:32,078 --> 01:41:35,623
He's, uh, busy with some other work.

1328
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:37,500
I understand.

1329
01:41:38,793 --> 01:41:42,546
You've still got some time left.
Do you want me to wait with you?

1330
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:44,215
No, no, thank you.

1331
01:41:44,298 --> 01:41:49,553
I think I would rather be alone.

1332
01:41:51,097 --> 01:41:52,390
- Okay.
- Mm-hm.

1333
01:41:54,350 --> 01:41:56,060
You know, we've come a long way.

1334
01:41:56,602 --> 01:41:57,853
Nine days.

1335
01:41:59,647 --> 01:42:00,564
Nine days.

1336
01:42:07,446 --> 01:42:08,280
[Kyo] Emma.

1337
01:42:10,116 --> 01:42:11,367
It's been a pleasure.

1338
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:22,837
[Emma] The pleasure's been mine.

1339
01:42:34,223 --> 01:42:36,183
[wind howling]

1340
01:42:48,028 --> 01:42:48,863
She's gone.

1341
01:43:24,148 --> 01:43:24,982
[Emma] <i>Will...</i>

1342
01:43:25,691 --> 01:43:29,320
<i>Probably by the time you read this,
I'll no longer exist.</i>

1343
01:43:30,279 --> 01:43:33,657
<i>I'm sorry that life
didn't go the way you wanted,</i>

1344
01:43:33,741 --> 01:43:35,993
<i>and that all the pain you went through</i>

1345
01:43:36,076 --> 01:43:39,705
<i>doesn't allow you
to see what I can see right now.</i>

1346
01:43:40,623 --> 01:43:42,833
<i>I took the freedom
to write all the beautiful moments</i>

1347
01:43:42,917 --> 01:43:44,877
<i>that I experienced in this house.</i>

1348
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:50,007
<i>Look attentively,
and you will always find these moments.</i>

1349
01:43:50,716 --> 01:43:53,260
<i>Please, don't take them for granted,</i>

1350
01:43:53,803 --> 01:43:57,097
<i>because in my nine days here, I never did.</i>

1351
01:43:58,265 --> 01:43:59,099
<i>Emma.</i>

1352
01:44:07,650 --> 01:44:09,652

[music swelling]

1359
01:45:47,374 --> 01:45:48,834
[Will] Hey!

1360
01:45:50,294 --> 01:45:51,420
Hey!

1361
01:45:52,713 --> 01:45:54,632
[faintly] Hey!

1362
01:45:56,175 --> 01:45:57,468
[faintly] Emma!

1363
01:46:45,975 --> 01:46:47,518
[music fades]

<i>Have you ever reckon'd the earth much?</i>

1365
01:47:06,704 --> 01:47:08,205
<i>Spend this day</i>

1366
01:47:09,456 --> 01:47:10,791
<i>And night with me</i>

1367
01:47:11,834 --> 01:47:14,169
<i>And you shall possess the origin</i>

<i>Of all poems</i>

<i>I...</i>

1370
01:47:19,216 --> 01:47:21,385
<i>I celebrate myself</i>

1371
01:47:22,386 --> 01:47:23,971
<i>And sing myself</i>

1372
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:28,892
<i>And what I assume you shall assume</i>

1373
01:47:28,976 --> 01:47:33,605
<i>For every atom belonging to me</i>

1374
01:47:33,689 --> 01:47:36,233
<i>As good belongs to you</i>

1375

<i>I loafe and invite my soul</i>

1376

01:50:02,129 --> 01:50:03,839
<i>Sun, sun, sun</i>

1426
01:50:03,922 --> 01:50:05,632
<i>Sun, sun, sun</i>

1427
01:50:05,716 --> 01:50:06,967
<i>Sun, sun</i>

1428
01:50:07,050 --> 01:50:10,596
<i>The last scud of sun holds back for me</i>

1429
01:50:11,138 --> 01:50:13,724
<i>It flings my likeness after the rest</i>

1430
01:50:13,807 --> 01:50:19,563
<i>And as true as any on the shadow'd wilds
It coaxes me to the vapor</i>

1431
01:50:19,646 --> 01:50:20,939
<i>And the dusk</i>

1432
01:50:23,442 --> 01:50:25,152
<i>I depart as air</i>

1433
01:50:26,945 --> 01:50:30,324
<i>I effuse my flesh in eddies</i>

1434
01:50:30,908 --> 01:50:33,827
<i>And drift it in lacy jags</i>

1435
01:50:34,786 --> 01:50:36,121
<i>And to die</i>

1436
01:50:37,789 --> 01:50:38,957
<i>Is different</i>

1437
01:50:39,625 --> 01:50:42,502
<i>Than any one supposed
And luckier</i>

1438
01:50:42,586 --> 01:50:44,796
<i>I bequeath myself to the dirt</i>

1439
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:47,925
<i>To grow from the grass I love</i>

1440
01:50:48,008 --> 01:50:49,760
<i>If you want me again</i>

1441
01:50:50,344 --> 01:50:52,554
<i>Look for me under your boot-soles</i>

1442
01:50:54,765 --> 01:50:57,017
<i>You will hardly know who I am
Or what I mean</i>

1443
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:00,229
<i>But I shall be good health
To you nevertheless</i>

1444
01:51:00,312 --> 01:51:03,440
<i>Failing to fetch me at first</i>

1445
01:51:03,523 --> 01:51:04,983
<i>Keep encouraged</i>

1446
01:51:05,943 --> 01:51:07,569
<i>Missing me one place</i>

1447
01:51:09,112 --> 01:51:10,405
<i>Search another</i>

1448
01:51:16,536 --> 01:51:18,330
<i>I stop someplace</i>

1449
01:51:19,790 --> 01:51:20,999
<i>Waiting for you</i>
