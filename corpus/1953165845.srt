1
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,900
Hands up, don't move!

2
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,480
Don't move or I'll blow your head off.

3
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Who else is here?

4
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,350
Who owns that car outside?

5
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,300
I do.

6
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,194
But it's really more like a lease...

7
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,300
Toss the keys over here.

8
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,000
- Okay, okay.
- Come on!

9
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:13,122
Empty the cash register.

10
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:16,120
- Start filling this bag. Cigarettes, pack-
- Excuse me.

11
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,915
I also have this gun, you'll probably
be needing that.

12
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,986
- Put it down! Right now!
- Put it down! Put it down!

13
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:21,319
Okay, don't want any trouble.

14
00:01:23,095 --> 00:01:24,610
Toss the piece over here then.

15
00:01:24,636 --> 00:01:27,954
I prefer not to throw it and
risk the gun accidently going off...

16
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,253
Maybe I could slide it over?

17
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,700
Yes, slide it over to my feet,
don't try anything funny.

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,425
Okay.

19
00:01:35,738 --> 00:01:39,980
I'm just gonna move over to this aisle,
and I slide it over to you.

20
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:43,732
Okay.

21
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:08,261
Sorry for the mess.

22
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,460
I couldn't decide.

23
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:17,729
Keep the change.

24
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:19,807
Wait!

25
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:22,005
What should I tell the police?

26
00:02:23,307 --> 00:02:25,628
Tell the those Tae-Bo tapes really paid off.
