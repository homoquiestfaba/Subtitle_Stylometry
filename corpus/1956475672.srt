1
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:55,704
Let your noble heart rest, Riccardo,
return to your fond dreams

2
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:06,020
you are shielded in this dwelling
by the love of a virgin world.

3
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,790
Let you noble heart rest

4
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,891
There is hate, too, which readies its revenge,
ever mindful of those who died for you.

5
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:26,101
Your hopes cannot make forgetfulness
blanket their sad graves

6
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:16,787
His Lordship!

7
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:34,041
Friends  soldiers 
And you who are equally dear to me!

8
00:07:36,382 --> 00:07:40,944
Give them to me;
You may count on me.

9
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:49,924
I must protect my children, satisfying
every just desire.

10
00:07:50,663 --> 00:07:57,626
Power has no beauty unless it dry
its subjects tears

11
00:07:58,137 --> 00:08:03,973
...and strive
for uncorrupted glory.

12
00:08:07,914 --> 00:08:11,350
Please read the list
of invitations to the ball.

13
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:16,418
- You have not forgotten any beauty?
These are the names.

14
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:23,458
Amelia  ah, she again!

15
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:38,372
My soul forgets all pomp for love of her!

16
00:08:39,612 --> 00:08:50,284
When I see here, pale and radiant,
my soul will be in ecstasy 

17
00:08:50,656 --> 00:09:01,328
and as I listen to her voice,
it will seem to speak of love.

18
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:11,636
The sweet night comes down,
fair with its starry gems;

19
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:20,110
Ah, but she is my only star

20
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:25,755
...a star the heavens cannot boast!

21
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:31,487
With generous love, lost in his thoughts,

22
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:35,992
..he will take our needs
as the object of his ponderings.

23
00:09:36,802 --> 00:09:51,240
...and as I listen to her voice,
it will seem to speak of love.

24
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:34,488
Go with the others; I shall call you.

25
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:53,073
The way is open to you at last.

26
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:01,848
How sad he seems!

27
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:08,786
Amelia!

28
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:13,120
- My lord
Oh heaven! Her husband!

29
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:23,734
My lord, you are unhappy, while everywhere your
name is bright with glory.

30
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:30,546
For ones ambition, that is much;
for the heart, nothing.

31
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:36,154
A secret, bitter care oppresses me.

32
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:38,821
- And this is 
Ah, no  more 

33
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,458
I shall tell you the reason.
Great God!

34
00:11:42,762 --> 00:11:43,990
That is?

35
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:50,758
I know all. Even this mansion
is no sure refuge for you.

36
00:11:51,203 --> 00:11:51,726
Go on

37
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:59,805
An evil plot is being contrived against you;
your life is threatened.

38
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:02,473
Ah! You are speaking of that?
You know of nothing else?

39
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:04,382
If you wish to know the names 

40
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:08,809
What does it matter? I despise them.

41
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:17,228
Say nothing; else I must
soil my hands with blood.

42
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:20,793
It shall not be,
I do not wish it.

43
00:12:22,902 --> 00:12:36,305
My peoples love
watches over me, and God protects me.

44
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:59,438
Your life, so rich in joy,so full of hope,

45
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:10,273
...is joined by Fate to thousands
of other lives!

46
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:26,264
If you are lost, what of our country,
what of its splendid future?

47
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:33,931
Can you be
forever safe from wounds,

48
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:52,515
...because your peoples love
is shielding you?

49
00:13:53,158 --> 00:13:58,562
Hate is quicker than love

50
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:04,329
...in striking its victims,

51
00:14:04,703 --> 00:14:12,735
if you are lost what of our country,

52
00:14:13,512 --> 00:14:20,008
...what of its splendid future?

53
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,816
The Judge.

54
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:29,116
Let him enter.

55
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:44,735
My lord!

56
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:50,809
What is this!!

57
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,329
A woman banished?
Why?

58
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:57,806
What is her name? What is her offence?

59
00:15:58,317 --> 00:16:02,686
Her name is Ulrica  the queen of the gypsies.

60
00:16:03,522 --> 00:16:09,552
But all the races follow her.

61
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,158
She can foretell the future.

62
00:16:12,664 --> 00:16:15,497
To her filthy cave, she summons the worst;

63
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:19,396
she is suspected of every evil counsel.

64
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:25,938
She deserves exile;
pray do not veto my decision.

65
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:29,674
What have you to say of her?

66
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,908
What have you to say of her?

67
00:16:34,186 --> 00:16:38,384
I wish to defend her.

68
00:16:46,832 --> 00:16:51,860
When she turns
her dusky brow to the stars

69
00:16:52,171 --> 00:16:56,972
...how her eyes
flash, like lightning,

70
00:16:57,342 --> 00:17:01,836
...as she foretells the course
of their loves

71
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:11,521
...to the belles of the town,
be it happy or sad!

72
00:17:12,591 --> 00:17:18,996
With Lucifer himself
she has a pact!

73
00:17:19,364 --> 00:17:23,562
..With Lucifer himself
she has a pact!

74
00:17:29,374 --> 00:17:33,140
A charming couple 
what a protector!

75
00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:41,517
Whoever touches
her prophetic gown,

76
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:46,586
...whether he plans to cross the sea
or go off to war,

77
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:51,453
...his future, his fortunes,
be they bitter or sweet,

78
00:17:51,830 --> 00:18:00,932
...his doubting heart
will learn from her,

79
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:08,612
it is with Lucifer himself
she has a pact!

80
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:21,320
Let her be condemned.

81
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:23,351
- Deign to absolve her.

82
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:29,165
Well, summon everyone:
I have something to tell you.

83
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:45,514
Gentlemen, I invite you today
to Ulricas house;

84
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:48,650
but come disguised
I shall be there.

85
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,315
Really?

86
00:18:50,822 --> 00:18:52,119
Yes, I must se this sight.

87
00:18:52,624 --> 00:18:54,023
Its not wise.

88
00:18:54,526 --> 00:18:56,994
I think, rather, its a splendid plan,
and promises great sport.

89
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:00,023
Someone there might recognise you.

90
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,138
What fright!

91
00:19:01,338 --> 00:19:03,500
Come, come, this counsellor of his
trembles at everything.

92
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:09,507
Prepare for me
a fishermans costume.

93
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:13,806
Who knows, perhaps the way to vengeance
will be opened to us there?

94
00:19:16,215 --> 00:19:19,548
Make sure that our sport is successful,
let all come to the magic house;

95
00:19:19,851 --> 00:19:23,287
let us abandon ourselves to this game,
together with the credulous folk.

96
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:27,316
Yes, hasten, but never forget
the dangers which threaten there,

97
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:30,795
and protect our magnanimous ruler,
so fearless for himself.

98
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:34,361
The seeress tells remarkable things,
I must question her myself, to hear

99
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:37,801
whether the stars smile upon me,
what good fortune may be in store for me.

100
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:51,140
Well, then gentlemen, I shall expect you
in disguise, at three oclock,

101
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:59,084
...in the oracles cavern,
at the great seeress feet.

102
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:08,961
We shall be there promptly,
in disguise, at three oclock,

103
00:20:09,468 --> 00:20:15,839
...in the oracles cavern,
at the great seeress feet.

104
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:20,009
Make sure that our sport is successful,
let all come to the magic house;

105
00:20:20,312 --> 00:20:23,543
For one day we shall laugh and joke,
for such is life at its best.

106
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:26,449
Ever watchful, we must be alert,
and not miss when the moment strikes.

107
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,555
At last a bit of folly brightens
this life which heaven gave us.

108
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:34,116
Perhaps the star which rules his fate
must plunge into the abyss.

109
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:37,288
...for such is life at its best.

110
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:48,833
At three, at three,

111
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:58,507
well, then, gentlemen, I shall expect you
in disguise, at three oclock,

112
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:05,188
...in the oracles cavern,
at the great seeress feet.

113
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:10,757
...yes, yes, in the oracles cavern,
at the great seeress feet.

114
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:09,774
Silence  the charm must not be broken.

115
00:23:11,316 --> 00:23:17,915
the devil will speak to her soon

116
00:23:24,463 --> 00:23:38,742
King of the depths, make haste,
hurtle down through the ether,

117
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:52,315
...and, sparing thy thunderbolts,
enter into my house,

118
00:23:53,625 --> 00:24:07,471
three times the owl
has sighed from on high.

119
00:24:08,139 --> 00:24:20,847
Three times the fire-eating
Salamander has hissed,

120
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:35,664
and three times the moaning
of the grave has spoken to me.

121
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:17,865
I am the first to arrive!

122
00:25:18,176 --> 00:25:21,976
Ruffian, stay back!

123
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,218
Oh, what is this sombre glow about us?

124
00:25:39,097 --> 00:25:49,302
It is he! It is he!

125
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:59,106
Passionately,I feel again
the tremendous thrill of his embrace!

126
00:26:00,285 --> 00:26:07,691
The torch of the future
he bears in his left hand.

127
00:26:08,593 --> 00:26:17,558
He has answered my conjury,
and all shines clear before me;

128
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:29,376
Nothing, no, nothing is hidden now
from my gaze!

129
00:26:29,748 --> 00:26:37,052
Nothing is hidden now
from my gaze!

130
00:27:11,856 --> 00:27:14,051
Hurrah for the sorceress!

131
00:27:14,826 --> 00:27:18,853
Silence, silence!

132
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:56,859
Make way, make way; I want my fortune told.

133
00:27:57,168 --> 00:28:00,797
A sailor in his Lordships service,

134
00:28:01,106 --> 00:28:05,042
I have defied death for him many a time.

135
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,349
Fifteen years Ive had of this bitter life,

136
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:21,217
..fifteen years that nothings been done for me.

137
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:26,194
And you ask?

138
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:30,457
Whats in store for me, after the blood
Ive shed.

139
00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:34,004
He speaks like a true soldier.

140
00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:38,272
- Your hand.
Take it.

141
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:58,124
Be of good cheer;
Soon you will have gold and rank.

142
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:00,226
You are joking?
Be assured.

143
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,959
She must not speak false.

144
00:29:02,267 --> 00:29:09,503
So fair a prophecy merits a reward.

145
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:21,947
''Riccardo to his beloved Silvano, officer.

146
00:29:22,453 --> 00:29:25,479
Ye gods! I am not dreaming!
Gold and a commission!

147
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,255
Hurrah for our Immortal Sibyl,

148
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:32,860
...who brings riches and pleasures to all!

149
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:35,259
Someones knocking!

150
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:42,829
Whats this!

151
00:29:44,008 --> 00:29:47,671
At the secret door 
one of Amelias servants!

152
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:49,607
Listen:

153
00:29:51,382 --> 00:29:54,408
my mistress,
who is waiting outside,

154
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:59,747
...wishes to
ask your advice in secret.

155
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:01,122
Amelia!

156
00:30:01,492 --> 00:30:04,586
Let her come; Ill send the others away.

157
00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:06,193
But not me.

158
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:13,734
Before I can answer you,

159
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:20,967
...I first must join with Satan;

160
00:30:21,546 --> 00:30:30,352
Go, let me gaze into the face of Truth.

161
00:30:30,989 --> 00:30:37,952
Let us go, that she may gaze into the face of Truth.

162
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:43,933
Go away, go away.

163
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:12,156
What stirs you so?

164
00:31:12,797 --> 00:31:18,133
A bitter, secret care,
which love has awakened

165
00:31:18,569 --> 00:31:19,536
What is this!

166
00:31:20,138 --> 00:31:22,470
And what do you seek?

167
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:32,374
Peace  to uproot from my breast,
so fatally ruled be the power I love,

168
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:41,391
that man  whom heaven made the ruler of all.

169
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,790
What do I hear! My beloved!

170
00:31:48,933 --> 00:31:51,595
Forgetfulness is granted you.

171
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:57,133
I know a secret potion, brewed from a magic herb,
which renews the heart.

172
00:31:58,042 --> 00:32:05,642
But whoever needs it,
must prick the herb himselfat midnight.

173
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:09,475
The place is ghostly

174
00:32:09,787 --> 00:32:12,620
- Where is it?
Do you dare?

175
00:32:12,924 --> 00:32:15,757
Yes, wherever it may be.

176
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:21,263
Then listen to me:

177
00:32:22,266 --> 00:32:31,732
To the west of town,

178
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:41,041
...there where the pale moon shines on the darker side
of that hideous field,

179
00:32:41,686 --> 00:32:50,754
go pick the herb which grows
at the foot of the stones of infamy

180
00:32:51,562 --> 00:33:00,129
...where crime is expiated
in the last sigh!

181
00:33:20,925 --> 00:33:22,654
O God! What a place!

182
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,726
You are stupefied, trembling, already!

183
00:33:27,231 --> 00:33:28,892
Poor love!

184
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,493
- Your heart fails you?

185
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:33,100
I am frozen with terror.

186
00:33:33,671 --> 00:33:39,007
If such be my duty,
even I shall find strength

187
00:33:39,577 --> 00:33:41,044
Tonight?
Yes.

188
00:33:41,746 --> 00:33:44,806
But not alone:
For I will follow you.

189
00:33:45,383 --> 00:33:57,693
Grant me, O Lord,
strength to purify my heart,

190
00:33:58,262 --> 00:34:00,457
I burn with love, I am resolved

191
00:34:01,032 --> 00:34:07,096
- to follow her even to hell,

192
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:12,774
- ...to quiet the fiery tumult within my breast.
- Amelia

193
00:34:13,411 --> 00:34:17,745
Go, without fear, for the charm
will dry your tears.

194
00:34:19,951 --> 00:34:25,787
if only, beloved Amelia,
I can breathe your sighs.

195
00:34:29,093 --> 00:34:43,440
Only dare  and you shall drink
forgetfulness of sorrow.

196
00:35:30,521 --> 00:35:35,185
Daughter of hell, open the door,
delay no longer in coming to us.

197
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,159
Quick  go now.

198
00:35:37,662 --> 00:35:39,129
- Tonight.

199
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:44,363
- But not alone: For I will follow you!
- Farewell.

200
00:36:06,657 --> 00:36:11,492
Come, seeress, mount your tripod,

201
00:36:13,464 --> 00:36:14,988
chant your prophecy,

202
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:17,895
mount your tripod

203
00:36:20,204 --> 00:36:21,501
Where is his lordship.

204
00:36:21,872 --> 00:36:25,308
Be silent, do not let them know I am here.

205
00:36:26,911 --> 00:36:30,745
Now, Sibyl, you who know all

206
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:34,512
...shall speak to me of my stars.

207
00:36:35,086 --> 00:36:38,613
Tell him the future, tell him the future!

208
00:36:50,568 --> 00:36:56,768
Tell me whether the sea
awaits me, faithful,

209
00:36:57,141 --> 00:37:03,137
...whether my beloved,
her face wet with tears,

210
00:37:03,648 --> 00:37:09,678
...betrayed my love

211
00:37:10,121 --> 00:37:18,495
...after she said goodbye,

212
00:37:18,929 --> 00:37:22,797
with tattered sails,
my soul tempest-tossed,

213
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,695
..I still cut my way
through the furious sea,

214
00:37:27,071 --> 00:37:38,141
...defying the rage
of heaven and hell,

215
00:37:39,183 --> 00:37:41,981
seeress, explore with care
what the future will bring,

216
00:37:42,286 --> 00:37:44,481
neither thunder
nor the rage of the winds,

217
00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:47,656
...not death nor love
can keep me from the sea

218
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:51,119
Ah, no!

219
00:37:51,495 --> 00:37:57,991
not death nor love
can keep me from the sea

220
00:37:58,636 --> 00:38:01,230
Neither thunder
nor the rage of winds,

221
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:04,337
...not death nor love
can keep him from the sea.

222
00:38:09,613 --> 00:38:15,984
On the swift ship
within whose womb I am tossed,

223
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:22,855
...when I awaken
in the howling storm,

224
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:29,764
...between the thunder crashes

225
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:39,103
..I sing sweet songs,

226
00:38:40,044 --> 00:38:43,536
I sing sweet songs
of my native land

227
00:38:43,848 --> 00:38:47,614
...which speak of the kisses
of our last farewell,

228
00:38:47,985 --> 00:39:00,329
...and my songs rekindle
the fire in my heart.

229
00:39:01,365 --> 00:39:04,425
Come, then, chant again
your mystic prophecy

230
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:06,835
...tell us what destiny brings,
no matter what it be,

231
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:09,936
Terror cannot
enter our hearts.

232
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:13,504
Ah, no!

233
00:39:13,878 --> 00:39:20,511
Terror cannot
enter our hearts.

234
00:39:21,085 --> 00:39:29,925
Terror cannot
enter our hearts.

235
00:39:43,441 --> 00:39:53,476
Whoever you are, your mad words
can change to sobs one day,

236
00:39:54,485 --> 00:40:03,792
..for he who violates the hidden realm
must wash away his crime with tears,

237
00:40:04,628 --> 00:40:14,833
...and he who insolently challenges his fate
must pay for his sin in his fate itself.

238
00:40:15,806 --> 00:40:17,239
Come, my friends.

239
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:19,641
Who will go first?

240
00:40:20,277 --> 00:40:23,246
I shall.
Please yield me this honour.

241
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:25,947
So be it.

242
00:40:38,062 --> 00:40:45,696
It is the hand of a great man,
living under the sign of Mars.

243
00:40:46,203 --> 00:40:48,068
She has hit the truth.

244
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:49,937
Silence!

245
00:40:54,078 --> 00:40:59,106
Wretched man 
Go  leave me  ask no more!

246
00:40:59,483 --> 00:41:01,280
Come, now, go on.

247
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:02,916
No  leave me.

248
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,121
Speak.
I beg you.

249
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:08,357
Finish it now!

250
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:13,358
I insist.

251
00:41:15,499 --> 00:41:22,598
Very well, then; soon you will die.

252
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:27,600
If on the field of honour, then I am glad

253
00:41:28,345 --> 00:41:32,543
No  by the hand of a friend.

254
00:41:33,817 --> 00:41:37,048
- Great God!

255
00:41:38,556 --> 00:41:40,854
What horror!

256
00:41:43,727 --> 00:41:53,193
So it is written above.

257
00:42:04,548 --> 00:42:16,483
A joke or madness
is such a prophecy.

258
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:27,964
How their credulity
amuses me!

259
00:42:28,539 --> 00:42:34,375
Ah, gentlemen, hearing
these sad words of mine,

260
00:42:34,745 --> 00:42:39,842
...you dare not laugh:
What things are in your hearts?

261
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:45,570
Her words are like arrows,
her glances like lightning;

262
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:51,021
through the devil, her confidant,
this woman knows all.

263
00:42:51,662 --> 00:42:56,681
What, then, is his fate?

264
00:42:56,881 --> 00:43:04,200
Shall he die by an assassins hand?

265
00:43:05,376 --> 00:43:14,910
The mere thought
makes ones heart shudder.

266
00:45:31,922 --> 00:45:38,691
Complete the prophecy.
Tell me, who will the killer be?

267
00:45:39,329 --> 00:45:43,925
The first to touch your hand today.

268
00:45:44,501 --> 00:45:46,128
Splendid.

269
00:45:47,271 --> 00:45:53,232
Which one of you will prove the oracle false?

270
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,906
No one!

271
00:46:01,185 --> 00:46:02,618
Here he is.

272
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:05,548
It is he!

273
00:46:07,124 --> 00:46:10,753
- I breathe again; fortune has saved us
The oracle has lied.

274
00:46:11,195 --> 00:46:18,226
Yes, because the hand in mine
is that of my most trusted friend.

275
00:46:18,802 --> 00:46:19,769
Riccardo!

276
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,298
The Count!

277
00:46:21,872 --> 00:46:27,674
Your genie
did not tell you who I am 

278
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:32,241
...nor that today
you were to be banished.

279
00:46:32,549 --> 00:46:33,345
I?

280
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:38,314
Silence; take this.

281
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:49,230
You are magnanimous, but among them
there is a traitor.

282
00:46:49,766 --> 00:46:53,167
...Perhaps more than one.

283
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,160
- Great God!

284
00:46:55,472 --> 00:46:57,372
Long live Riccardo!

285
00:46:57,875 --> 00:46:59,137
What voices are these?

286
00:46:59,443 --> 00:47:01,001
Viva!

287
00:47:03,914 --> 00:47:06,542
Move quickly, if it is he,

288
00:47:07,384 --> 00:47:13,323
our friend and father.

289
00:47:14,424 --> 00:47:20,556
All of you, bow down with me,

290
00:47:21,398 --> 00:47:29,703
and sing the hymn of our faith.

291
00:47:30,941 --> 00:47:40,213
O son of England,
beloved of this land,

292
00:47:40,517 --> 00:47:49,391
rule in happiness, for health
and glory smile upon you!

293
00:47:50,027 --> 00:47:53,507
Can I nurse suspicion within my breast,

294
00:47:53,707 --> 00:47:57,991
...when a thousand hearts
exult in dying for me?

295
00:47:58,368 --> 00:48:01,720
The proudest laurel,
more precious than treasure,

296
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,831
shall be entwined upon your
brow by gratitude and faith.

297
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:10,646
Evil fortune forever hovers
even over the greatest triumph,

298
00:48:10,948 --> 00:48:14,509
...in which a hypercritical Fate
conceals an evil end.

299
00:48:15,152 --> 00:48:18,747
He does not believe his fate,
yet he shall die of his wounds;

300
00:48:19,056 --> 00:48:23,356
he laughed at my prophecy.
But he has a foot in the grave.

301
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:57,216
Here is the horrid field where crime
and death are joined together!

302
00:53:59,462 --> 00:54:05,094
There, the columns,
there the plants, green their base.

303
00:54:06,236 --> 00:54:09,933
I shall go on.

304
00:54:15,612 --> 00:54:22,518
Ah, my heart is chilled!

305
00:54:28,158 --> 00:54:32,288
Everything, even the sound of my own step,

306
00:54:32,662 --> 00:54:38,601
...fills me with terror!

307
00:54:41,271 --> 00:54:46,004
And if I should die?

308
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:51,579
To die!

309
00:54:52,515 --> 00:55:07,761
If such should be my fate,
my duty, then let it some..

310
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:21,041
...So be it.

311
00:55:37,627 --> 00:55:53,942
When I have plucked the herb,

312
00:55:54,677 --> 00:56:14,087
...with my own hand, from its arid stem,
when from my troubled mind

313
00:56:15,665 --> 00:56:24,471
...that dear image will have been effaced,

314
00:56:24,941 --> 00:56:41,916
...what is left, once love is dead?

315
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:03,275
Oh! Who is weeping, what power,
what power holds me back,

316
00:57:04,747 --> 00:57:10,982
barring my way on this fearful road?

317
00:57:12,455 --> 00:57:14,650
Courage now

318
00:57:15,758 --> 00:57:29,866
Oh poor heart, be of stone,
do not betray me, nor yield to tears,

319
00:57:30,707 --> 00:57:38,944
...of cease to beat,

320
00:57:39,449 --> 00:57:57,164
...and die,
crumble to nothingness!

321
00:58:05,775 --> 00:58:07,265
Midnight!

322
00:58:08,044 --> 00:58:10,376
Ah, what do I see?

323
00:58:11,114 --> 00:58:15,608
A head rises up from beneath the earth  and sigh!

324
00:58:15,919 --> 00:58:23,917
In its eyes, anger flashes,

325
00:58:24,627 --> 00:58:26,975
and it stares at me 

326
00:58:27,175 --> 00:58:31,089
silent, terrible.

327
00:58:58,795 --> 00:59:08,431
Ah, help me, give me strength,

328
00:59:09,238 --> 00:59:17,612
o Lord, mercy on a suffering heart!

329
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:13,317
I am with you.
Great God!

330
01:01:13,626 --> 01:01:17,187
- Be calm!
- Ah! What do you fear?

331
01:01:17,763 --> 01:01:23,201
Ah, leave me I am a victim, sobbing before you.

332
01:01:23,502 --> 01:01:28,701
..Save at least my name 
Or shame and suffering will kill me.

333
01:01:29,208 --> 01:01:31,733
I leave you? No never;

334
01:01:32,044 --> 01:01:36,640
I cannot, because within my breast
an eternal love burns for you.

335
01:01:37,149 --> 01:01:42,644
My lord, take pity on me.

336
01:01:43,155 --> 01:01:46,283
You speak so to one who adores you?

337
01:01:46,725 --> 01:01:51,162
You ask pity? You are still trembling?

338
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:56,900
Your name shall never be sullied,
nor honour.

339
01:01:57,937 --> 01:02:03,807
But Riccardo, I am anothers 
I belong to your dearest friend

340
01:02:04,109 --> 01:02:05,007
Do not say it, Amelia.

341
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:13,685
I belong to him
who would give his life for you.

342
01:02:14,186 --> 01:02:17,781
Ah, cruel woman, and you remind me,

343
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:23,325
you repeat it to me now!

344
01:02:28,367 --> 01:02:36,706
Do you not see that if remorse
corrodes and cuts my soul,

345
01:02:37,209 --> 01:02:45,913
...I cannot hear, nor heed its cry,
so long as my soul is full of love?

346
01:02:46,652 --> 01:02:50,850
You do not know what would be left of you

347
01:02:51,457 --> 01:02:55,325
...if your heart should cease to beat!

348
01:02:56,161 --> 01:03:00,757
How many sleepless nights, I have longed for you?

349
01:03:01,133 --> 01:03:05,194
How long I have struggled in my anguish!

350
01:03:05,704 --> 01:03:12,075
how many times have I prayed to heaven

351
01:03:12,945 --> 01:03:19,578
...for that pity which now you ask from me!

352
01:03:20,219 --> 01:03:30,561
But in spite of all this, have I ever known
a moments peace without you?

353
01:03:32,398 --> 01:03:42,433
Ah, heaven, comfort the anguish
of one who lies between disgrace and death:

354
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:52,113
Merciful God, shine Thy light on the gate
of salvation, guide my erring step.

355
01:03:53,085 --> 01:04:01,550
Go, now  let me not hear you, leave me.

356
01:04:01,927 --> 01:04:12,269
I belong to him who gave his blood for you.

357
01:04:13,472 --> 01:04:24,076
My life, the world,
for one word 

358
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:28,017
Merciful heaven!

359
01:04:30,723 --> 01:04:34,750
Tell me you love me 

360
01:04:38,097 --> 01:04:40,691
Riccardo, go!

361
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:50,768
One word 

362
01:04:56,482 --> 01:05:03,012
Yes, I love you.

363
01:05:03,522 --> 01:05:11,520
You love me, Amelia!

364
01:05:12,865 --> 01:05:21,239
But you, in your nobility,

365
01:05:21,673 --> 01:05:32,982
You love me, Amelia!
- ...protect me from my heart!

366
01:05:54,573 --> 01:05:56,564
You love me!

367
01:06:00,279 --> 01:06:06,514
Oh, let remorse, friendship, be destroyed
within my breast:

368
01:06:07,152 --> 01:06:22,796
let all be dead,
all except my love!

369
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:35,009
Oh, how sweet the thrill
which fills my heart!

370
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:41,148
ah, let me hear you speak those words again!

371
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:51,156
star of this darkness,
to whom, I dedicate my heart

372
01:06:51,463 --> 01:06:57,095
...shine your lovelight on me,
then day need never come again!

373
01:07:08,046 --> 01:07:14,713
Ah, on this melancholy bed,
where I yearned to quench it,

374
01:07:15,087 --> 01:07:22,391
...this love returns, more overpowering,
this love which wounded me!

375
01:07:22,828 --> 01:07:31,099
Why is it not granted me
to pour out my soul to him?

376
01:07:31,403 --> 01:07:37,103
Or, if not, at least to sleep
forever here, in death.

377
01:07:48,787 --> 01:07:53,486
Amelia! You love me, Amelia?
You love me?

378
01:07:53,859 --> 01:07:56,054
Yes,

379
01:07:56,695 --> 01:08:13,135
I love you.

380
01:08:13,512 --> 01:08:21,214
But you, in your nobility..

381
01:08:21,587 --> 01:08:24,750
You love me, Amelia?

382
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:33,966
...protect me from my heart.
- Shine your lovelight on me.

383
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:30,878
Alas! Someone is coming.

384
01:10:31,183 --> 01:10:33,617
Who comes to this
Place of death?...

385
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:37,181
Ah, I am not mistaken!

386
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:41,520
- Renato!
- My husband!

387
01:10:50,335 --> 01:10:51,097
You, here?

388
01:10:51,336 --> 01:10:54,362
To save you from those who,
in hiding above, would ambush you

389
01:10:54,673 --> 01:10:55,662
- Who are they?
Conspirators.

390
01:10:56,141 --> 01:10:57,039
Oh heaven!

391
01:10:57,409 --> 01:11:01,402
I ran past, wrapped in my cloak;
they took me for one of themselves.

392
01:11:02,714 --> 01:11:07,344
I heard someone call out, Ive seen him;
Its Riccardo,

393
01:11:07,919 --> 01:11:10,410
'with an unknown beauty.

394
01:11:10,722 --> 01:11:13,213
Then another said, A brief conquest!

395
01:11:13,725 --> 01:11:16,319
since he dies, if my swift hand

396
01:11:16,628 --> 01:11:19,096
''...succeeds in ending his tender embrace.

397
01:11:19,598 --> 01:11:20,860
I am dying!
Take heart.

398
01:11:21,099 --> 01:11:25,092
Here, take this.
Take care, the way to safety is over there.

399
01:11:25,604 --> 01:11:28,164
I must save you.
Wretched me! Go 

400
01:11:28,673 --> 01:11:32,666
But you would only expose him, madame,
to their pitiless daggers!

401
01:11:33,178 --> 01:11:34,372
Please, escape alone!

402
01:11:34,813 --> 01:11:35,837
And leave you here?

403
01:11:36,148 --> 01:11:38,639
The road is still open to you  flee

404
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:43,649
And leave you alone,
here, with him?

405
01:11:43,955 --> 01:11:46,651
No, never! I would sooner die.

406
01:11:47,058 --> 01:11:49,526
Either you escape or I will remove my veil.

407
01:11:49,828 --> 01:11:51,056
What are you saying?
Decide.

408
01:11:51,363 --> 01:11:52,796
Desist.
You must.

409
01:11:53,231 --> 01:12:03,505
If it be granted me to save him,

410
01:12:04,176 --> 01:12:12,914
..I shall never fear my cruel fate again

411
01:12:26,698 --> 01:12:30,131
My friend, I entrust you with a delicate mission:

412
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:35,333
Let the love you bear me be your warrant.

413
01:12:35,707 --> 01:12:37,675
Affidati, imponi

414
01:12:37,976 --> 01:12:43,471
Promise me, swear
that you will take her veiled, to the town,

415
01:12:46,518 --> 01:12:50,454
without speaking to her, or looking at her.

416
01:12:51,022 --> 01:12:53,115
I swear.

417
01:12:56,361 --> 01:13:03,790
And that once at the gates, you will go
alone in the opposite direction.

418
01:13:04,603 --> 01:13:12,169
I swear it

419
01:13:13,845 --> 01:13:17,645
Do you hear the sombre tones
of death sounding in the night?

420
01:13:18,149 --> 01:13:21,277
From up there, among the black rocks,
the enemys signal has been given.

421
01:13:21,586 --> 01:13:25,078
Wrath is burning in their breasts,
they are coming down, encircling you,

422
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:33,024
their fury is directed full upon you 
for mercys sake, go, fly from here.

423
01:13:39,237 --> 01:13:42,798
Flee, flee; down over the horrid trail,
I hear their pitiless step advancing.

424
01:13:43,108 --> 01:13:46,566
And each of the impious ruffians
brandishes a dagger in his hand.

425
01:13:47,078 --> 01:13:50,377
Go, save yourself, or the pass
will soon be closed;

426
01:13:50,882 --> 01:13:54,249
go save yourself: the life you would throw away
is the life of the people.

427
01:13:54,753 --> 01:13:58,484
Go, flee, go!

428
01:14:04,329 --> 01:14:07,355
Traitors, conspirators, these men
who threaten my life?

429
01:14:07,866 --> 01:14:11,495
Ah, I too am a traitor to my friend 
it is I who have wounded his heart.

430
01:14:11,803 --> 01:14:18,470
Were I innocent, I should challenge them.
Now, guilty of love, I must flee.

431
01:14:18,843 --> 01:14:25,442
May the mercy of the Lord be upon her,
protecting her life!

432
01:15:21,573 --> 01:15:23,564
Follow me.

433
01:15:24,075 --> 01:15:25,975
O God!

434
01:15:26,578 --> 01:15:31,777
Why do you tremble?
You can trust in me.

435
01:15:32,951 --> 01:15:38,218
Let a friends voice
encourage you!

436
01:15:41,059 --> 01:15:45,155
Here they come.

437
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:48,556
- Quick! Lean against me.
I am dying.

438
01:15:48,867 --> 01:15:51,836
...Let us fall upon him,
the hour at last has struck.

439
01:15:52,137 --> 01:15:55,129
The rising sun

440
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:58,632
...will find his corpse.

441
01:16:05,784 --> 01:16:11,780
Do you see his goddess
there all veiled in white?

442
01:16:12,357 --> 01:16:16,521
Let us plunge him from heaven
into hell.

443
01:16:17,095 --> 01:16:18,619
Who goes there?

444
01:16:19,197 --> 01:16:20,562
Thats no he.

445
01:16:21,066 --> 01:16:22,226
Oh, fury!

446
01:16:22,801 --> 01:16:24,268
It is not his lordship

447
01:16:24,836 --> 01:16:29,637
No, it is I
who stand before you.

448
01:16:35,814 --> 01:16:38,044
His trusted friend!

449
01:16:38,683 --> 01:16:42,881
We have been
less fortunate than you;

450
01:16:43,188 --> 01:16:48,751
...we waited in vain
for a beautiful womans smile.

451
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:54,696
I at least should like to see
this goddess face.

452
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,463
Not one step more: if you dare,
Ill draw my sword 

453
01:16:59,771 --> 01:17:02,205
You threaten us?
I do not fear you.

454
01:17:02,507 --> 01:17:03,906
Oh, heaven help us!

455
01:17:04,209 --> 01:17:06,575
Put down sword
Traitors!

456
01:17:06,878 --> 01:17:07,845
Enough of this 

457
01:17:08,146 --> 01:17:11,115
Then your life
will pay for this insult.

458
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:13,918
No  stop!

459
01:17:15,653 --> 01:17:19,953
What! Amelia!

460
01:17:22,927 --> 01:17:26,454
She! His wife!

461
01:17:27,699 --> 01:17:30,759
Oh, heaven! Mercy!

462
01:17:39,878 --> 01:17:45,578
Amelia!

463
01:17:49,187 --> 01:18:04,091
See how, at night, the enamoured hero
comes here to rest with his bride,

464
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:18,972
...and how in the honeyed moonlight
he lies on a bed of dew!

465
01:18:19,651 --> 01:18:24,020
Ah, ah, ah!

466
01:18:24,389 --> 01:18:36,426
What gossiping therell be about this,
what comments well hear in the town!

467
01:18:38,369 --> 01:18:43,932
- This is my reward for saving him!-
To whom, in this ever crueller world,

468
01:18:44,242 --> 01:18:48,838
- He has defiled my wife!-
...can you turn, O wretched Amelia?

469
01:18:50,048 --> 01:18:59,514
- Because of him, I dare not lift my head,
he has destroyed my heart forever!

470
01:19:00,058 --> 01:19:11,799
- Where will you find a compassionate hand
to dry your miserable tears?

471
01:19:12,437 --> 01:19:16,737
Ah, ah, ah!

472
01:19:17,175 --> 01:19:28,575
What gossiping therell be about this,
what comments well hear in the town!

473
01:20:28,313 --> 01:20:31,305
Will you meet with me
at my home tomorrow morning?

474
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:34,550
Are you asking for satisfaction?

475
01:20:35,286 --> 01:20:37,550
No. Something quite different is in my mind.

476
01:20:37,955 --> 01:20:42,016
-What is it?
If you come, you shall know.

477
01:20:42,593 --> 01:20:48,930
We shall not fail.

478
01:20:56,841 --> 01:21:02,746
Let us go, then: each separate
from the others, each by a different way!

479
01:21:03,381 --> 01:21:09,320
Tomorrow morning
will see great things.

480
01:21:11,656 --> 01:21:12,884
Let us go, let us go.

481
01:21:16,494 --> 01:21:23,093
See how the tragedy changed to farce.

482
01:21:28,306 --> 01:21:33,710
Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha!
What gossiping therell be

483
01:21:40,318 --> 01:21:42,786
I have sworn to escort you
to the gates of the town.

484
01:21:43,354 --> 01:21:45,914
How like the knell of death
his voice strikes on my heart!

485
01:21:46,891 --> 01:21:52,523
-Let us go! Let us go!
Oh no! Have pity!

486
01:23:38,736 --> 01:23:45,005
For such an offence, tears are useless,
being powerless to efface it or excuse it.

487
01:23:45,376 --> 01:23:48,368
Now all prayers are in vain;

488
01:23:48,746 --> 01:23:52,648
Blood must flow, and you shall die.

489
01:23:53,284 --> 01:23:59,621
But if the guilt, my guilt,
lies only in the fact which accuses me?

490
01:24:00,191 --> 01:24:01,920
-Silence, adulterous woman.
Great God!

491
01:24:02,226 --> 01:24:04,126
Ask Him rather for mercy.

492
01:24:04,428 --> 01:24:09,058
-Does a single suspicion suffice for you?

493
01:24:09,367 --> 01:24:13,633
-And you want to kill me?

494
01:24:14,205 --> 01:24:20,804
You insult me, no longer feeling
justice nor pity?

495
01:24:21,445 --> 01:24:24,346
Blood must flow, and you shall die.

496
01:24:24,982 --> 01:24:28,850
For a moment, it is true, I loved him,

497
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:32,321
-but I did not disgrace your name.

498
01:24:32,823 --> 01:24:39,786
God knows this, that in my breast
no unworthy passion ever burned.

499
01:24:40,364 --> 01:24:45,927
You have finished;

500
01:24:47,038 --> 01:24:49,131
it is now too late 

501
01:24:49,774 --> 01:24:57,306
blood must flow, and you shall die.

502
01:24:58,916 --> 01:25:01,248
Ah! You would kill me!

503
01:25:01,852 --> 01:25:03,615
So be it, then.

504
01:25:03,921 --> 01:25:07,015
-One grace I pray 

505
01:25:07,458 --> 01:25:10,222
Not from me.
Address your prayers to Heaven.

506
01:25:10,728 --> 01:25:13,629
Only one word more to you.

507
01:25:13,931 --> 01:25:16,764
Hear me out,

508
01:25:17,535 --> 01:25:22,029
it will be the last time.

509
01:25:23,808 --> 01:25:30,441
...the last time

510
01:25:56,574 --> 01:26:15,119
I shall die, but first, in kindness,
ah, let me at least

511
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:37,047
...clasp to my breast
my only child.

512
01:26:40,651 --> 01:26:57,990
And if to your wife
you deny this last favour,

513
01:26:58,769 --> 01:27:19,920
...do not refuse the prayer
of a mothers heart.

514
01:27:23,794 --> 01:27:41,907
I shall die, but let his kisses
console this body,

515
01:27:42,580 --> 01:28:09,135
...now that the end
has come to my brief life.

516
01:28:10,574 --> 01:28:22,076
Once she is dead by his fathers hand

517
01:28:23,087 --> 01:28:29,788
...let him touch with his hand

518
01:28:30,895 --> 01:28:48,439
...these eyes of a mother
whom he will never see again

519
01:30:53,737 --> 01:31:00,255
Arise; there is your son,

520
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:03,574
I permit you to see him.

521
01:31:04,782 --> 01:31:17,525
In the darkness and the silence, there,
hide your blushes and my shame.

522
01:31:38,716 --> 01:31:48,751
It is not she, nor her breast that I must strike.

523
01:31:50,694 --> 01:32:00,695
Anothers blood must wash away the sin!

524
01:32:01,472 --> 01:32:06,933
Your blood!

525
01:32:07,811 --> 01:32:16,241
and my dagger,

526
01:32:16,754 --> 01:32:32,796
...avenger of my tears,

527
01:32:54,825 --> 01:33:14,940
You it was who stained that soul;
which was the joy of my own,

528
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:23,814
...who inspired my trust,

529
01:33:24,254 --> 01:33:32,821
...then loathsomely
poisoned all life for me.

530
01:33:34,898 --> 01:33:59,087
Traitor, who in such a way regarded
the faith of your dearest friend!

531
01:34:23,981 --> 01:34:48,136
Oh sweetness, lost; O memory
of a heavenly embrace,

532
01:34:48,739 --> 01:35:18,833
when Amelia, in her pure beauty,

533
01:35:21,738 --> 01:35:44,288
lay on my breast, in the warmth of love!

534
01:35:46,897 --> 01:35:49,161
All is finished 

535
01:35:51,134 --> 01:36:10,976
now only hate and death live in my widowed heart!

536
01:36:16,059 --> 01:36:27,596
Oh, sweetness lost,

537
01:36:28,171 --> 01:36:57,127
oh, hope of love!

538
01:37:51,288 --> 01:37:53,756
We are alone.

539
01:37:55,158 --> 01:37:56,853
Listen to me,

540
01:37:57,861 --> 01:38:01,145
I know your plans in full.

541
01:38:01,345 --> 01:38:05,893
You are determined to kill Riccardo.

542
01:38:06,403 --> 01:38:10,533
- You are dreaming.
Here is the proof!

543
01:38:12,175 --> 01:38:17,010
And now you will reveal the plot to his lordship?

544
01:38:17,381 --> 01:38:21,283
No, I want
a part of it.

545
01:38:22,285 --> 01:38:23,843
You are joking.

546
01:38:25,122 --> 01:38:33,587
And not just words;
now, with facts, I shall quiet your suspicions,

547
01:38:40,904 --> 01:38:43,737
I am yours,

548
01:38:44,841 --> 01:38:52,270
in me you will have a tireless comrade
in this bloody work;

549
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:57,487
my son shall be my warrant.

550
01:39:00,397 --> 01:39:03,397
Kill him if I fail you.

551
01:39:05,662 --> 01:39:11,999
Such a change
is scarcely credible.

552
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:16,137
You must not try to know the cause,

553
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:20,604
I am yours,

554
01:39:21,778 --> 01:39:27,114
...by the life of my only son!

555
01:39:27,751 --> 01:39:29,241
He is not lying.

556
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:31,287
No, he is not lying.

557
01:39:31,955 --> 01:39:33,286
You hesitate.

558
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:38,188
No more.

559
01:39:44,434 --> 01:39:54,400
The shame of each, then, the shame of it all,
...single that vengeance in our hearts

560
01:39:54,778 --> 01:40:04,244
which shall fall on that damnable head,
tremendous, unappeasable in its fury.

561
01:40:05,088 --> 01:40:14,622
The shame of each, then, the shame of it all,
single that vengeance in our hearts

562
01:40:14,998 --> 01:40:24,566
...which shall fall on that damnable head,
tremendous, unappeasable in its fury.

563
01:40:27,644 --> 01:40:31,307
- I ask only one thing of you.
And that is?

564
01:40:31,882 --> 01:40:34,874
That I may be the one to kill him.

565
01:40:35,385 --> 01:40:37,148
No, Renato:

566
01:40:37,654 --> 01:40:44,025
he took the home
of my forefathers from me; that right is mine.

567
01:40:44,861 --> 01:40:48,319
And to me, whose brother he killed,

568
01:40:48,632 --> 01:40:54,764
...who have been devoured by the anguish
of revenge, ceaselessly, for ten years,

569
01:40:55,138 --> 01:40:59,541
...what part would you give?

570
01:41:01,278 --> 01:41:04,179
Silence.

571
01:41:04,681 --> 01:41:16,718
Only by lot can we decide.

572
01:41:56,533 --> 01:41:57,830
Who is coming?

573
01:41:58,468 --> 01:41:59,492
You?

574
01:42:00,070 --> 01:42:04,734
Oscar has come,
bringing an invitation from his lordship

575
01:42:05,375 --> 01:42:06,342
From him!

576
01:42:08,144 --> 01:42:09,270
Let him wait.

577
01:42:12,682 --> 01:42:21,715
Stay here. You must,
since it seems Heaven has sent you.

578
01:42:22,425 --> 01:42:29,661
What sadness comes over me, what sorrow!
What a flash of terror!

579
01:42:42,846 --> 01:42:46,009
She knows nothing  have no fear,

580
01:42:46,316 --> 01:42:50,753
on the contrary, she will bring us luck,

581
01:42:59,029 --> 01:43:04,467
There are three names in this vase.

582
01:43:05,969 --> 01:43:12,636
Your hand must choose one.

583
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:15,834
But why?

584
01:43:16,146 --> 01:43:18,580
Obbedisci: non chieder di pi

585
01:43:18,948 --> 01:43:29,552
There is no doubt  a fierce destiny
will have me partner in a murder.

586
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:31,949
Who, then, is the chosen one?

587
01:44:36,993 --> 01:44:38,927
Renato

588
01:44:39,496 --> 01:44:41,555
My name!

589
01:44:43,366 --> 01:44:53,640
O just fate,
vengeance is granted to me!

590
01:44:54,277 --> 01:44:57,769
Ah! You seek his lordships death!
The cruel words did not speak false.

591
01:44:58,081 --> 01:45:03,986
Their daggers, already bared,
flash above his head.

592
01:45:04,888 --> 01:45:14,559
The grief of America shall be paid for
by the traitor whose glory it was.

593
01:45:15,131 --> 01:45:22,833
Let him who has struck fall stricken,
such is his just reward!

594
01:45:35,552 --> 01:45:38,646
Let the messenger enter.

595
01:45:52,735 --> 01:45:56,728
My lord requests
your presence,

596
01:45:57,106 --> 01:46:01,600
...with your husband,
at a masked ball this evening.

597
01:46:01,911 --> 01:46:02,878
I cannot come.

598
01:46:03,379 --> 01:46:05,040
Will his lordship be there too?

599
01:46:05,548 --> 01:46:06,446
Of course

600
01:46:06,883 --> 01:46:08,373
Oh fate!

601
01:46:08,885 --> 01:46:11,877
Such an invitation
is precious, I know.

602
01:46:12,856 --> 01:46:16,917
It will be a magnificent
masked ball.

603
01:46:17,293 --> 01:46:18,783
Splendid!

604
01:46:19,729 --> 01:46:25,133
- She will come with me.
Great God!

605
01:46:25,702 --> 01:46:31,732
We too shall go, if such a masquerade
will hasten the moment of our revenge.

606
01:46:33,743 --> 01:46:42,674
Ah! what brilliance, what music
will fill the mansion

607
01:46:42,986 --> 01:46:48,686
...where the flower of our youth will gather together,

608
01:46:49,058 --> 01:46:54,587
...the blossoms so fair of our beautiful city

609
01:46:54,898 --> 01:46:56,733
And it was I, wretched one,

610
01:46:56,933 --> 01:47:01,827
who drew the pitiless sheet from the
evil urn for my husband in his fury:

611
01:47:03,215 --> 01:47:06,840
My mind depicts him there,
lifeless among the dancers,

612
01:47:09,117 --> 01:47:12,217
staining the floor with his blood
the doer of evil will die,

613
01:47:12,417 --> 01:47:13,994
he shall have no pity from us.

614
01:47:18,688 --> 01:47:25,150
A revenge in masquerade 
it couldnt be better,

615
01:47:25,461 --> 01:47:28,089
in the press of the ball,

616
01:47:28,665 --> 01:47:35,264
It will be a funeral dance, attended by pale beauties

617
01:47:36,595 --> 01:47:44,978
If only I could warn him 
without betraying my husband!

618
01:48:24,531 --> 01:48:30,262
If only I could warn him 
without betraying my husband!

619
01:48:49,912 --> 01:48:53,507
- You will be Queen of the ball.

620
01:48:54,350 --> 01:48:55,681
What costume shall I wear?

621
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:01,286
Blue the domino, with a red sash tied in a knot at the
left.

622
01:49:01,591 --> 01:49:03,786
And what will our password be?

623
01:49:04,961 --> 01:49:07,987
Death!

624
01:49:08,564 --> 01:49:10,036
If only I could warn him 

625
01:49:10,795 --> 01:49:14,396
Death!

626
01:50:42,859 --> 01:50:51,130
Perhaps she has reached home
and is safe at last.

627
01:50:53,369 --> 01:51:02,505
Honour and duty have destroyed the abyss
between us.

628
01:51:02,879 --> 01:51:09,182
Ah yes, Renato will return to England 

629
01:51:09,685 --> 01:51:15,089
and his wife with him.

630
01:51:15,458 --> 01:51:23,957
Let the great ocean divide us,
with no farewell 

631
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:32,300
and let the heart keep silent.

632
01:51:46,722 --> 01:51:54,527
I still hesitate?

633
01:51:57,934 --> 01:52:01,495
But O heaven, must I not?

634
01:52:02,371 --> 01:52:17,548
...Ah, I have signed my sacrifice!

635
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:40,999
But if I must lose you
forever, light of my life,

636
01:52:41,644 --> 01:52:52,612
...my love will reach you
wherever you may be,

637
01:52:53,055 --> 01:53:04,227
once the memory of you

638
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:14,032
...is locked inside my heart,

639
01:53:19,448 --> 01:53:29,585
And now what dark misgivings assail my heart,

640
01:53:30,326 --> 01:53:41,828
...with the fatal desire to see you once again 

641
01:53:42,204 --> 01:53:52,170
as if this were the last hour of our love?

642
01:55:24,006 --> 01:55:25,439
Ah! She is there 

643
01:55:26,308 --> 01:55:30,301
I could see her once more 
could speak to her again 

644
01:55:30,813 --> 01:55:33,805
but no: for now everything has torn me from her.

645
01:55:40,089 --> 01:55:42,557
An unknown lady gave me this letter.

646
01:55:42,925 --> 01:55:47,658
It is for his lordship, she said, take it to him
secretly.

647
01:55:53,402 --> 01:55:57,065
It says that during the ball
someone will attempt to kill me.

648
01:55:57,807 --> 01:56:02,039
But if I dont go then
they will think me a coward.

649
01:56:03,379 --> 01:56:07,008
This, no: no one must even suspect it.

650
01:56:07,516 --> 01:56:13,250
Go  get ready,
immediately, to attend the ball with me.

651
01:56:18,594 --> 01:56:28,697
Yes, to see you again, Amelia.

652
01:56:30,139 --> 01:56:39,980
...As I look upon your beauty,
once again my heart

653
01:56:40,983 --> 01:56:47,252
...will burn with love.

654
01:56:59,902 --> 01:57:02,302
Love and the dance go on in these joyous halls,

655
01:57:04,306 --> 01:57:08,606
while life is only a fleeting dream.

656
01:57:12,047 --> 01:57:16,381
O night of precious moments,
of romance and of song,

657
01:57:16,886 --> 01:57:22,290
...why dost thou not halt thy flight,
to repose on the wave of pleasure?

658
01:57:34,803 --> 01:57:36,930
There is another of our men.

659
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:40,338
- ''Death!''

660
01:57:40,910 --> 01:57:42,400
- Yes, death!

661
01:57:43,078 --> 01:57:44,705
Its useless to wait.

662
01:57:45,014 --> 01:57:46,072
- Useless? Why?

663
01:57:46,382 --> 01:57:47,679
He is elsewhere.

664
01:57:47,983 --> 01:57:50,213
- Oh deceiving fate!
He will escape us forever!

665
01:57:50,519 --> 01:57:52,953
Speak softly; someone is watching us.

666
01:57:53,188 --> 01:57:56,282
-Who is it?
The man to the left, in the short domino.

667
01:58:02,364 --> 01:58:04,798
I shall not leave you,

668
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:07,293
you disguise yourself badly.
Away with you!

669
01:58:08,737 --> 01:58:10,170
You are Renato.

670
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:12,739
And you are Oscar.

671
01:58:13,108 --> 01:58:14,439
How rude!

672
01:58:14,743 --> 01:58:18,110
Good enough  but is it right for you to steal down
to the ball

673
01:58:18,414 --> 01:58:21,349
...while is lordship is asleep?

674
01:58:21,850 --> 01:58:23,666
- He is here
What! Where is he?

675
01:58:23,976 --> 01:58:25,767
- I wont tell!
A fine thing!

676
01:58:28,424 --> 01:58:31,257
- Find him yourself.
Come, now!

677
01:58:31,894 --> 01:58:38,231
You want to play the same trick on him?

678
01:58:39,068 --> 01:58:44,576
Calm yourself;
cant you tell me at least how hes dressed?

679
01:58:50,462 --> 01:58:58,678
...You want to know how he is dressed,
while that is a thing he doesnt want known

680
01:58:58,878 --> 01:59:06,787
Oscar knows,
but he will not tell,

681
01:59:07,363 --> 01:59:11,823
Tra la la la
la la la la

682
01:59:42,806 --> 01:59:48,316
My heart is aflame,
in a tumult of love,

683
01:59:48,516 --> 01:59:54,366
but I still know how secrets are kept.

684
01:59:54,743 --> 02:00:02,912
Neither rank nor beauty
can make me tell 

685
02:00:15,397 --> 02:00:22,462
Oscar knows,
but will not tell,

686
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:41,080
Love and the dance go on
in these joyous halls,

687
02:00:42,091 --> 02:00:45,959
while life is only
a fleeting dream

688
02:01:00,909 --> 02:01:04,106
I know that you know who his friends are.

689
02:01:04,413 --> 02:01:08,008
You want to ask him something,
or joke with him?

690
02:01:08,317 --> 02:01:09,249
Precisely.

691
02:01:09,551 --> 02:01:11,712
And then to betray the person who told you?

692
02:01:12,020 --> 02:01:15,649
You offend me.
Believe me, I know all I need to know.

693
02:01:16,225 --> 02:01:17,021
Its quite important to you??

694
02:01:17,259 --> 02:01:21,992
There are urgent matters
which I must discuss with him.

695
02:01:22,297 --> 02:01:24,959
It will be
your fault if I dont succeed.

696
02:01:25,834 --> 02:01:26,562
Well, then!

697
02:01:26,802 --> 02:01:30,033
If you tell me, its a favour to him.

698
02:01:30,773 --> 02:01:33,799
He is wearing a black cape,
with a pink ribbon on his chest

699
02:01:34,109 --> 02:01:36,771
One word more.
I have said more than enough.

700
02:01:37,079 --> 02:01:39,980
Love and the dance go on
in these joyous halls,

701
02:01:41,517 --> 02:01:45,510
while life is only
a fleeting dream.

702
02:01:49,224 --> 02:01:54,025
O night of precious moments,
of romance and of song,

703
02:01:54,930 --> 02:02:03,565
...why dost thou not halt thy flight,
to repose on the wave of pleasure?

704
02:02:49,885 --> 02:02:51,978
Ah! Why are you here? Go away

705
02:02:52,287 --> 02:02:55,950
- It was you who sent the letter?
Here you are surrounded by death.

706
02:02:56,325 --> 02:02:58,725
I am not frightened.

707
02:02:59,027 --> 02:03:02,053
Go, go, or you will fall here,
stabbed to death!

708
02:03:02,564 --> 02:03:06,261
- Tell me your name.
Great God! I cannot

709
02:03:06,568 --> 02:03:09,969
Then why do you weep  plead, so frightened?

710
02:03:10,272 --> 02:03:13,400
Why do you feel such concern for my life?

711
02:03:13,709 --> 02:03:16,906
For your life, I would sacrifice my own!

712
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:27,118
You cannot hide yourself:
you are that angel, Amelia!

713
02:03:28,257 --> 02:03:35,026
I love you, yes, I love you, and in tears
I fall at your feet,

714
02:03:35,797 --> 02:03:42,965
...here where an unknown dagger
of vengeance is thirsting for your blood.

715
02:03:43,505 --> 02:03:51,344
If you stay here,
tomorrow you will be dead.

716
02:03:51,647 --> 02:03:59,349
Save yourself  go  leave me,
fly from those that hate you

717
02:03:59,922 --> 02:04:07,090
As long as you love me, Amelia,
I care nothing for my fate!

718
02:04:07,529 --> 02:04:14,901
I have nothing to save you in my soul,
and the rest of the world is forgotten

719
02:04:15,337 --> 02:04:22,743
Nor am I afraid of death
Because even stronger than death

720
02:04:23,211 --> 02:04:30,583
..Is the breath of your love
which intoxicates me.

721
02:05:11,560 --> 02:05:17,931
Then you insist on seeing me
die of anguish and shame?

722
02:05:18,233 --> 02:05:25,537
I want to save you.
Tomorrow, with Renato, you will go

723
02:05:25,841 --> 02:05:27,103
Where?

724
02:05:27,676 --> 02:05:30,110
To your native land.

725
02:05:30,412 --> 02:05:32,039
To England!

726
02:05:32,347 --> 02:05:34,338
My heart is breaking

727
02:05:36,184 --> 02:05:42,282
but you will leave  farewell!

728
02:05:42,724 --> 02:05:49,630
Riccardo!
My heart is breaking

729
02:05:50,732 --> 02:05:58,195
- I leave you, Amelia!
Riccardo!

730
02:05:59,074 --> 02:06:06,571
- Once more, farewell!

731
02:06:06,948 --> 02:06:17,381
Once more, farewell!

732
02:06:17,826 --> 02:06:23,958
Farewell!

733
02:06:24,666 --> 02:06:27,066
And this is my farewell to you!

734
02:06:28,036 --> 02:06:31,233
Help!

735
02:06:32,507 --> 02:06:34,998
Oh heaven! He is murdered!

736
02:06:35,310 --> 02:06:37,835
Who did it?
Where is the villain?

737
02:06:38,146 --> 02:06:39,443
There he is!

738
02:06:40,849 --> 02:06:43,010
Renato!

739
02:06:43,652 --> 02:06:47,884
Renato! Ah! Death, infamy
our swords upon him,

740
02:06:48,390 --> 02:06:52,292
our avenging swords!

741
02:06:52,861 --> 02:06:57,059
Death to the traitor!

742
02:06:57,632 --> 02:07:03,593
Death, death to the traitor!
Death, infamy to the traitor!

743
02:07:05,907 --> 02:07:08,899
No, no  leave him

744
02:07:09,411 --> 02:07:11,504
leave him!

745
02:07:13,448 --> 02:07:19,045
You hate me

746
02:07:49,184 --> 02:08:08,992
She is pure: in the arms of death,
while God hears my words, I swear it.

747
02:08:12,674 --> 02:08:30,116
I, who loved your wife,
respected her purity.

748
02:08:33,662 --> 02:08:50,341
Advanced to a new post,
you were to leave with her 

749
02:08:55,450 --> 02:09:11,390
I loved her, but would not have
either her heart or your name offended!

750
02:09:11,900 --> 02:09:18,703
Oh, what remorse of love
devours my heart

751
02:09:19,274 --> 02:09:29,206
..between the guilty, bloodied one
and his victim, who lies dying!

752
02:09:29,951 --> 02:09:41,556
What thirst for vengeance and for blood
was inspired by my tragic error!

753
02:09:42,197 --> 02:09:47,100
My thanks to all; I still am ruler here,

754
02:09:47,902 --> 02:10:00,178
any my pardon absolves everyone.

755
02:10:01,583 --> 02:10:21,698
Spare us, merciful God,
so great and generous a heart!

756
02:10:22,070 --> 02:10:31,790
To us wretched ones on earth,

757
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:43,050
He is a ray of Thy heavenly love!

758
02:10:59,607 --> 02:11:05,011
Addio per sempre, miei figli

759
02:11:05,380 --> 02:11:07,405
He is dying

760
02:11:07,782 --> 02:11:13,462
Farewell, forever, my children 

761
02:11:13,662 --> 02:11:18,454
farewell  beloved country

762
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:25,747
Farewell, forever, my children  ah 

763
02:11:25,947 --> 02:11:28,699
Ah! I am dying!

764
02:11:30,372 --> 02:11:33,671
Ah! Ahim! lo moro!

765
02:11:34,042 --> 02:11:44,179
My children, forever ...

766
02:11:49,824 --> 02:11:56,753
farewell!

767
02:11:57,132 --> 02:12:04,197
Night of horror, night of horror!
