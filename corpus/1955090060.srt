1
00:00:35,018 --> 00:00:39,618
Keep your eyes on the road,
or pull over and I'll drive.

2
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:20,916
All nurses to the
nurses' station.

3
00:01:24,604 --> 00:01:26,669
Paging Dr. Battaglia.

4
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,138
Call extension 198.
Dr. Battaglia, extension 198.

5
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:46,617
I heard the other female

6
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:48,235
in the car with
her may not make it.

7
00:01:48,236 --> 00:01:49,469
We have to move quickly.

8
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,771
She's going into shock.
We're losing her.

9
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,369
You got some more drugs today?

10
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,070
Just a couple. Not much,
no more than that.

11
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:35,070
Ok. Did you bring me some?

12
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,871
You know I did.

13
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:41,904
Appreciate that. See
you later on, all right?

14
00:02:41,905 --> 00:02:43,105
See you tonight.

15
00:02:43,106 --> 00:02:45,172
-Ok.
-All right.

16
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:58,206
Phaedra!

17
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,704
Phaedra! Phaedra!

18
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:12,871
Phaedra, do you not
hear me calling you?

19
00:03:13,772 --> 00:03:15,638
Say what? God!

20
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,137
Do you not hear me
calling you, girl?

21
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:18,736
I said, what?

22
00:03:18,737 --> 00:03:19,805
You don't smell that?

23
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:22,005
I cannot wait to move
out of these apartments.

24
00:03:22,006 --> 00:03:23,803
The smell is driving me crazy.

25
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,004
I don't smell anything.

26
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,303
-You don't smell that?
-No.

27
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:27,571
Little boys down there smoking

28
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:29,037
their stinking mess seeping
up through the cracks,

29
00:03:29,038 --> 00:03:29,805
you don't smell it?

30
00:03:29,806 --> 00:03:31,639
No,?

31
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,639
There's a single's meet and
greet tonight at the church

32
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,272
and I was gonna ask
you if you wanted to go,

33
00:03:35,273 --> 00:03:38,471
but I don't have anybody
to watch Mikayla, so...

34
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:41,804
And you still don't,
because I have plans.

35
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,738
What? Another party?

36
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,672
If you must know, yes.

37
00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:48,938
Nice shot. You don't
do anything anyway.

38
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:49,903
All you sit around here and do

39
00:03:49,904 --> 00:03:52,771
every day is nothing. Nothing.

40
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:54,039
And?

41
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,138
And you're a grown
woman without a job,

42
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,039
that don't bother you?

43
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,471
No, 'cause I got money.

44
00:03:57,472 --> 00:03:58,437
Which I'm sure's running thin,

45
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,071
since all you do every weekend

46
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,270
behind another no-good man.

47
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:05,138
Is that your sanctified
way of calling me a ho?

48
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:07,238
What? Did I call you that?

49
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:08,572
Did I say that to you?

50
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:11,038
No, but you're over here
dropping bombs like I'm stupid.

51
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,271
I know what you're
trying to say, Tammy.

52
00:04:13,272 --> 00:04:14,772
What am I trying to say, Phae?

53
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:15,638
What am I trying to say?

54
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,905
That I don't do
nothing with my life.

55
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:18,804
You don't. That's not a lie.

56
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:20,073
Ok, that's what's up.

57
00:04:20,074 --> 00:04:21,705
I won't be here much longer.

58
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:24,539
I'm not pushing you out,
all I'm telling you to do,

59
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,604
slow your roll, stop
living in the past

60
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:27,772
and running behind
these no good men.

61
00:04:27,773 --> 00:04:30,072
And look at you, going
to church to find a man.

62
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:32,738
I hope you get a good
one tonight, Tammy.

63
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,638
Somebody to be Mikayla's daddy

64
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,806
so you can stop
asking me to watch her.

65
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:38,038
Church ho.

66
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:41,773
Wow, Phae, really?
Was that necessary?

67
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:45,871
Well then, stop popping
off, talking about what I do.

68
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:47,106
Look.

69
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,906
I'm sorry if I
hurt your feelings.

70
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:52,006
Will you forgive me?

71
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:53,806
You didn't hurt my
feelings, I'm cool.

72
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:56,138
Well, good. Then you can
sit here and watch Mikayla.

73
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:58,940
I'm gonna go get
dressed. Appreciate it.

74
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:11,241
Black design. I
do like what I see.

75
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:23,073
Mr. Owens? Mrs.
Owens is on the line.

76
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:25,740
She said it was urgent.

77
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:34,773
Malaina, what is this emergency?

78
00:05:34,774 --> 00:05:37,105
Chris, can you
please just come home

79
00:05:37,106 --> 00:05:39,839
before the fashion show tonight?

80
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,674
No, I can't, it's too hectic.

81
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,206
Please. I need you here,
just for a little while.

82
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:48,106
This pain is unbearable.

83
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:49,908
Malaina.

84
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:52,607
I said I can't, ok?

85
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:56,172
I'll call you, or
I'll have Tiffany

86
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:58,806
call you to check on you later.

87
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:00,940
Are you mad at me or something?

88
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:04,075
No I'm not, I'm not mad.

89
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,008
I'm just tired.

90
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:11,175
I'm sorry. If you can't
come, I understand.

91
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:14,609
Well, I love you.

92
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:17,174
Yeah, me too.

93
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:46,940
So, what did you
get for number five?

94
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:49,841
I got two times 22, which was...

95
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,006
How does Mommy look, good?

96
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:52,807
Do you want me to add something?

97
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:54,840
I'll call you back, Adriana.

98
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:56,673
Jewelry, makeup?

99
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:57,773
Too much cleavage.

100
00:06:57,774 --> 00:07:00,175
What? That was intentional,
why'd you do that?

101
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:01,375
You're going to church.

102
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:02,475
I know, but I don't
wanna come home

103
00:07:02,476 --> 00:07:04,908
without a number, at least.

104
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:06,440
It's rather desperate.

105
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:08,709
Whatever. Your
Mama has needs too.

106
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,341
Mom, I don't wanna hear
about old people's needs.

107
00:07:12,342 --> 00:07:14,607
Correction, honey. I'm not old.

108
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:17,074
I just need someone to
talk to that's my age.

109
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:18,440
There's only so
much I can talk to

110
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:20,407
my 13 year old daughter about.

111
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:24,941
Sorry, Mom, but my conversations
are quite stimulating.

112
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:26,874
What? Little girl, please.

113
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:31,209
Phae! I'm leaving. I'm gonna
do something to your hair.

114
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:37,808
How long you gonna be gone?

115
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:41,674
It's over at ten, but
if I meet somebody,

116
00:07:41,675 --> 00:07:42,673
don't wait up.

117
00:07:42,674 --> 00:07:44,907
Wait, Mom, what's
that supposed to mean?

118
00:07:44,908 --> 00:07:46,607
It just means that,

119
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:49,876
I might go for drinks and
conversation afterwards.

120
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:50,975
That's it. Conversation.

121
00:07:50,976 --> 00:07:52,841
But I thought they
were serving dinner

122
00:07:52,842 --> 00:07:55,775
and drinks at the church.

123
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,608
They are.

124
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:58,641
I haven't met anybody
and you're already

125
00:07:58,642 --> 00:08:00,341
opposed to me having
a conversation?

126
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:03,176
Goodness! Just saying.

127
00:08:03,777 --> 00:08:06,277
Come over here and
give Mom a kiss.

128
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:09,110
Yeah, right.

129
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:11,310
What's that supposed to mean?

130
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:14,143
Girl, you ain't had
none in what, 12 years?

131
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:16,009
Girl, when a man
touch your mama tonight

132
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,940
and you gonna hear
singing soprano by 10:15.

133
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:20,175
That's not a bad thing.

134
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:23,743
Aunty, that's not funny.

135
00:08:23,744 --> 00:08:25,110
Mom. -What?

136
00:08:25,111 --> 00:08:26,976
Can you please be
back here by 10:30?

137
00:08:26,977 --> 00:08:29,043
Honey, even if I am,

138
00:08:29,044 --> 00:08:31,810
you won't know,
'cause you won't be up.

139
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,042
Don't let her stay up late.

140
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:34,909
And off that phone 10 o'clock.

141
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,109
-10?
-10 o'clock. Not playing

142
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,542
with you. 10 o'clock.

143
00:08:37,543 --> 00:08:39,109
It's the weekend.
She's not a baby.

144
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,243
Whatever, I can't
expect you to understand.

145
00:08:40,244 --> 00:08:43,242
You ain't a mom. Phae, Phae.

146
00:08:43,243 --> 00:08:44,576
I wasn't thinking
when I said that.

147
00:08:44,577 --> 00:08:47,610
I'm sorry. Phae?
Look, I'm sorry.

148
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:51,776
Move. Come on, do
you some good. Bye.

149
00:08:51,777 --> 00:08:54,676
Lord, Jesus. Help us, Jesus.

150
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:55,876
All right, I'm gonna go.

151
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:57,510
Come lock this door, ok.

152
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:58,776
I love you.

153
00:08:58,777 --> 00:09:00,643
Yeah, I love you too.

154
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:04,810
Remember what I said.
Off that phone by 10. 10!

155
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,711
Ok, Mom.

156
00:09:30,344 --> 00:09:32,578
You can do this.

157
00:10:15,378 --> 00:10:16,577
Hello?

158
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:19,744
Mrs. Owens? Hi. This is Tiffany.

159
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:22,878
Mr. Owens asked me
to give you a call.

160
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:23,777
Are you all right?

161
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:25,245
Tiffany.

162
00:10:25,811 --> 00:10:27,677
Yes, I'll be all right.

163
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:31,910
Are you sure? I called earlier,
but there was no answer.

164
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:33,744
I'm actually at the door.

165
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:35,245
Are you?

166
00:10:35,713 --> 00:10:37,344
I'm sorry, Tiffany. Hold on.

167
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,079
Just give me a minute.
I'll be at the door.

168
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:55,847
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:56,746 --> 00:11:00,478
The medicine I take for pain
completely knocks me out.

170
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,978
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way over here.

171
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:04,045
It was no problem, Mrs. Owens.

172
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:07,878
To be honest, I was
glad to get out of there.

173
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,879
Too much going on.

174
00:11:10,814 --> 00:11:12,612
I was actually getting dressed.

175
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:15,878
I wanted to surprise
Chris, but I took that pill

176
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,678
and it just knocked me out.

177
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,779
You still can go.

178
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,012
If you miss the show,
there's still a party afterwards.

179
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:26,012
Ok. Let me get my clothes on.

180
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:28,112
But it takes me a
while to get dressed.

181
00:11:28,113 --> 00:11:31,912
Yeah, do you mind if
I get dressed here?

182
00:11:31,913 --> 00:11:34,011
Make yourself at home.

183
00:11:34,012 --> 00:11:35,613
Thanks.

184
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:26,679
Malaina.

185
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,678
My God, Gail!

186
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,678
How are you, darling?

187
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,646
Good.

188
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:32,113
Where's Chris been
keeping you these days?

189
00:12:32,114 --> 00:12:33,980
Done working on a new project.

190
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:35,814
Are you modeling again?

191
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:36,747
No, not me.

192
00:12:36,748 --> 00:12:37,946
No?

193
00:12:37,947 --> 00:12:39,012
No, you know Tiffany Martin.

194
00:12:39,013 --> 00:12:40,546
Chris's assistant.

195
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:41,480
Hi, Tiffany.

196
00:12:41,481 --> 00:12:43,313
This is Gail Stewart,
one of the top

197
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:45,613
fashion consultants
in the business.

198
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:47,612
I've met her before,
seen her before.

199
00:12:47,613 --> 00:12:49,614
She's a doll.
Great on the runway.

200
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:51,713
Yes, she is. And Freddrick.

201
00:12:51,714 --> 00:12:52,814
Where is he, is he here?

202
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,046
Yeah, he was just here.

203
00:12:54,047 --> 00:12:54,845
I'm looking for my Chris, too.

204
00:12:54,846 --> 00:12:56,113
Have you seen him tonight?

205
00:12:56,114 --> 00:12:57,612
Yes, but not lately.

206
00:12:57,613 --> 00:12:59,646
But if you stick around,
you'll probably see him.

207
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:01,046
If not, I'll let him know
you're looking for him.

208
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,247
Ok, well, thanks, Gail.

209
00:13:03,614 --> 00:13:04,848
It was wonderful
to see you again.

210
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:06,113
You too.

211
00:13:06,114 --> 00:13:07,913
And I'll see you in
New York tomorrow night?

212
00:13:07,914 --> 00:13:09,314
With Chris?

213
00:13:09,882 --> 00:13:11,846
Not sure.

214
00:13:11,847 --> 00:13:14,282
Guess that slipped Chris's mind.

215
00:13:14,848 --> 00:13:15,646
Nice to meet you.

216
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,813
There he is. We'll talk soon.

217
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:20,548
Bye.

218
00:13:20,848 --> 00:13:23,614
Hey, Tammy.
Uncle Nate.

219
00:13:23,615 --> 00:13:25,847
Hey listen, I'll be in
town in a couple of weeks.

220
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:28,282
I'm gonna drop by and see you.

221
00:13:28,848 --> 00:13:30,814
Yeah, yeah.

222
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:34,312
Tell your sister I said
I'll see her in two weeks.

223
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,846
Ok. Love you too. Love you too.

224
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:38,549
All right.

225
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:30,848
Aunty?

226
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:32,616
Mikayla, get out of my room!

227
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,614
All right, y'all,
we're slowing it down.

228
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,515
Find that special one
you've been eyeing all night.

229
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:18,117
Ladies, let your Boaz find you.

230
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:47,884
That was so much fun.
I had a good time.

231
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:49,450
Well, the night's still young.

232
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:50,684
We're grown. -What?

233
00:16:50,685 --> 00:16:53,183
No, I mean, I can
do for some coffee.

234
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:56,784
I don't know, I kind
of have to get home.

235
00:16:56,785 --> 00:16:58,117
So, maybe another time.

236
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,016
Ok, I understand.

237
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:02,950
Wait, don't give up so easily.

238
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:05,017
You're right, we're grown.

239
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:06,950
And I could use a drink.

240
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:09,585
A coffee. So, sure.

241
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:20,751
Well, this is kind of fun.

242
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:23,351
Not too many churches do this
type of thing for singles.

243
00:17:23,352 --> 00:17:24,918
Yeah, I almost didn't come.

244
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,986
Why not? I had so much fun.

245
00:17:27,818 --> 00:17:30,716
Well, I didn't wanna seem
desperate or anything.

246
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:31,683
That I can understand.

247
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,984
Just nervous about dating again.

248
00:17:35,518 --> 00:17:37,552
Well, it's been a
while for me too.

249
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:39,585
Like 12 years.

250
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:41,050
Whoa, 12 years?

251
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:42,684
Really? Yeah, 12 years.

252
00:17:42,685 --> 00:17:44,684
It was just me and
my baby for a while.

253
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:46,184
So I wanted to
give her everything

254
00:17:46,185 --> 00:17:48,252
and dating didn't fit into that.

255
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:51,085
Ok. I understand that.

256
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,949
One of my buddies talked
me into doing this.

257
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,985
Really?

258
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:57,783
I wasn't interested
in dating again.

259
00:17:57,784 --> 00:18:00,986
Well you can tell this buddy

260
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:03,753
thank you for me.

261
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,784
Wanna sit?

262
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:06,150
Yeah.

263
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,184
Ok.

264
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:08,652
So why didn't you wanna date?

265
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:09,916
You don't have like a
stalker ex-girlfriend

266
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,285
out there, do you?

267
00:18:11,286 --> 00:18:13,518
Watching us right now.

268
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,918
No...

269
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:17,119
I lost my wife in a car accident

270
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,018
a year and a half ago.

271
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:21,285
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

272
00:18:21,286 --> 00:18:23,288
It's all right.

273
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:28,952
Car full of teenagers.
Smoking and drinking.

274
00:18:28,953 --> 00:18:30,919
Enjoying life.

275
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:35,451
One of them said the driver
swerved right into my wife.

276
00:18:35,452 --> 00:18:39,819
Killed her and my unborn son.

277
00:18:41,185 --> 00:18:42,852
Phaedra, slow down!

278
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:44,651
Baby girl, I got this.

279
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:47,484
Slow your butt down
and quit playing.

280
00:18:47,485 --> 00:18:49,918
Will you tell your
mama to stop worrying?

281
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,352
Aunty gonna get us home safely.

282
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:52,820
Keep your eyes on the road,

283
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:55,120
or pull over and I'll drive.

284
00:18:55,753 --> 00:18:59,555
Oops. My bad, let
me stop playing.

285
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,618
You ok?

286
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:09,818
-Yeah, I gotta go.
I'm so sorry. I just...

287
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:10,986
Wait. Was it something I said?

288
00:19:10,987 --> 00:19:12,018
No, it's not you, trust me.

289
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:14,554
I just have to go.

290
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,918
Great.

291
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,985
Dang, Tam, dang, Tammy.

292
00:19:18,986 --> 00:19:20,184
My gosh, don't mess this up.

293
00:19:20,185 --> 00:19:21,787
Don't, get it, Tammy,
get it together.

294
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:25,221
Get it together. ok. ok. ok.

295
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:32,321
Ok. And I didn't
even get his number.

296
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:37,720
I've got to. Come on, Tammy.

297
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:07,118
Excuse me, miss, excuse me.

298
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,154
Are you all right?

299
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:09,921
No, the car just stopped.

300
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:11,653
I don't know what's
wrong with it.

301
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:15,087
Well, pop the hood, let me
check it out for you, ok?

302
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:23,820
Looks like it's running hot.

303
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:27,255
Let me go inside and get
some coolant for you, ok?

304
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:38,920
Hey. Do you need
any help or anything,

305
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:39,920
are you ok?

306
00:20:39,921 --> 00:20:43,853
Yes. No. I have someone coming.

307
00:20:43,854 --> 00:20:46,354
Well, do you want me to
wait with you till they come?

308
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:47,154
I mean, you just look like

309
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:48,688
you could use a friend.

310
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:52,722
And to be honest,
I could use one too.

311
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,989
Your wine, ma'am.

312
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:19,290
Thank you.

313
00:21:20,622 --> 00:21:23,754
Slow down. You're not gonna
find your answers in there.

314
00:21:23,755 --> 00:21:25,820
Then where?

315
00:21:25,821 --> 00:21:28,021
My life is falling apart.

316
00:21:28,022 --> 00:21:30,322
I'm sick, and it's
ruining my life.

317
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:34,088
My husband's cheating. My
car's stopped out of nowhere.

318
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:36,154
Give me some answers, then.

319
00:21:36,155 --> 00:21:38,887
Everything happens
for a reason, Malaina.

320
00:21:38,888 --> 00:21:39,221
Everything.

321
00:21:39,222 --> 00:21:40,921
That's the best that
you can come up with?

322
00:21:40,922 --> 00:21:42,855
No, look, listen.

323
00:21:42,856 --> 00:21:44,387
God, He uses our experiences to

324
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,755
build our character
and our faith in Him.

325
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:47,821
You're one of them.

326
00:21:47,822 --> 00:21:48,787
What is that?

327
00:21:48,788 --> 00:21:50,089
Like my grandma.

328
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,089
I don't even care about
that stuff anymore.

329
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:55,922
I get it.

330
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:58,155
Your struggle is internal.

331
00:21:58,156 --> 00:22:00,821
You're not gonna find it
on the outside, sweetheart.

332
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:02,788
Do you know how to pray?

333
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:03,187
Pray?

334
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,454
Yeah, pray.

335
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:06,323
I haven't prayed since
I was a little girl.

336
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:07,922
I used to pray with my grandma

337
00:22:07,923 --> 00:22:09,721
and my grandpa about school,

338
00:22:09,722 --> 00:22:14,489
or my binky, or for
my mom to get well.

339
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,123
I think I understand
what's going on here.

340
00:22:17,124 --> 00:22:20,121
I believe that God is
using your experiences

341
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:22,321
to get you talking to Him again.

342
00:22:22,322 --> 00:22:24,022
He hasn't forgotten about you.

343
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:27,456
He created you. He
loves you, Malaina.

344
00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:30,558
It's gon' be ok.
I promise.

345
00:22:30,924 --> 00:22:33,257
Let me pray for you.

346
00:22:35,124 --> 00:22:39,321
Dear Father. In
the name of Jesus,

347
00:22:39,322 --> 00:22:41,558
I thank you for who You are.

348
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:05,224
Malaina.

349
00:23:06,857 --> 00:23:08,292
Malaina!

350
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:11,292
We need to talk.

351
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,889
Look, Chris.

352
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,122
I don't wanna fight tonight.

353
00:23:17,123 --> 00:23:18,956
Let's talk tomorrow.
I don't feel good

354
00:23:18,957 --> 00:23:21,158
and I just wanna lie down.

355
00:23:22,957 --> 00:23:24,856
You see, that's my problem.

356
00:23:24,857 --> 00:23:25,856
Right there.

357
00:23:25,857 --> 00:23:28,256
You're always too
tired or sleepy,

358
00:23:28,257 --> 00:23:30,623
and I can't touch you
anymore or have sex

359
00:23:30,624 --> 00:23:31,857
because you never
know when you're gonna

360
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:33,656
have another episode.

361
00:23:33,657 --> 00:23:35,355
We can't go out
in public no more

362
00:23:35,356 --> 00:23:37,822
because you're always
rushing off to a bathroom.

363
00:23:37,823 --> 00:23:40,323
Now your near misses,
you're puking all the time,

364
00:23:40,324 --> 00:23:42,224
this is embarrassing.

365
00:23:43,424 --> 00:23:45,090
It's obviously nothing working.

366
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:48,256
Doctors, surgeries, medicine.

367
00:23:48,257 --> 00:23:50,291
It's insufferable.

368
00:23:50,957 --> 00:23:53,057
And you can't be
so naive to think

369
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:56,857
that another woman
wouldn't be in the picture.

370
00:23:56,858 --> 00:23:58,558
It's obvious, Malaina.

371
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,191
It ain't working
out for you, me.

372
00:24:04,825 --> 00:24:06,825
I want a divorce.

373
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,293
I knew I'd find you here.

374
00:24:33,691 --> 00:24:35,326
Mikkey.

375
00:24:35,858 --> 00:24:37,959
You not talking, now?

376
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,658
Listen, I know I hurt
your feelings the other day

377
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:43,057
and I didn't mean
to yell at you.

378
00:24:43,058 --> 00:24:45,560
I'm sorry. You forgive Aunty?

379
00:24:46,424 --> 00:24:48,290
I have nothing to say to you.

380
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:51,259
You use drugs and
you know better.

381
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,756
I'm 13, and everywhere I go

382
00:24:54,757 --> 00:24:57,691
there's somebody smoking
weed, popping pills,

383
00:24:57,692 --> 00:25:01,924
or mixing pills and alcohol,
trying to get higher.

384
00:25:01,925 --> 00:25:04,127
Kids my age and younger.

385
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,823
Teenage boys on
the steps smoking

386
00:25:07,824 --> 00:25:10,025
over at Adriana's house.

387
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:11,591
Now in my own house?

388
00:25:11,592 --> 00:25:15,824
Is life that bad that's
the only alternative?

389
00:25:15,825 --> 00:25:19,293
I'm not mad at you. I hate you.

390
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,592
Mikayla.

391
00:25:22,593 --> 00:25:24,592
Mikkey. Look.

392
00:25:24,593 --> 00:25:26,325
I didn't know you were
that passionate about it.

393
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:29,126
I promise, I'm sorry,
I won't smoke anymore.

394
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,459
Yeah, whatever.

395
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,324
Mikayla. You are my niece.

396
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:34,658
I love you more than
anything in this world.

397
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:37,659
There's nothing I
wouldn't do for you.

398
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,092
I promise, I'll quit.

399
00:25:40,093 --> 00:25:42,725
Really, Aunty?
I'll hold you to it.

400
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:46,760
How did I get such
a responsible niece?

401
00:25:54,592 --> 00:25:59,360
This is embarrassing.
I want a divorce.

402
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:04,891
It's obviously nothing working.

403
00:26:04,892 --> 00:26:08,059
Doctors, surgeries, medicine.

404
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,359
It's insufferable.

405
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,360
This is embarrassing.
I want a divorce.

406
00:26:14,628 --> 00:26:17,827
It's obviously nothing
working. It's insufferable.

407
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,660
Shut up!

408
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:29,328
God, if you're still
there, I need you.

409
00:26:30,461 --> 00:26:32,261
Malaina?

410
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,561
Miss Malaina?

411
00:26:48,761 --> 00:26:50,628
Malaina!

412
00:26:55,793 --> 00:26:58,161
Malaina?

413
00:26:58,626 --> 00:27:00,560
Tiffany?

414
00:27:00,561 --> 00:27:01,660
Malaina.

415
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,662
You scared me. What
are you doing here?

416
00:27:05,293 --> 00:27:06,960
I called your
phone several times,

417
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:09,126
but you didn't answer.

418
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,994
So I came by.

419
00:27:11,661 --> 00:27:16,761
I can't stay. I heard about
the party and your car.

420
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:18,726
So I wanted to check on you.

421
00:27:18,727 --> 00:27:23,361
Thanks, Tiffany, but I
didn't call you today.

422
00:27:23,362 --> 00:27:26,426
It may have been Mr. Owens.

423
00:27:26,427 --> 00:27:28,693
Probably. It doesn't matter.

424
00:27:28,694 --> 00:27:31,860
Either way, I'm just glad
you came when you did.

425
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:33,960
Why? You ok?

426
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:36,296
Yeah. I will be.

427
00:27:37,294 --> 00:27:38,960
Can I share something with you?

428
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:39,894
Yeah.

429
00:27:39,895 --> 00:27:40,692
In confidence?

430
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:42,228
Sure.

431
00:27:43,427 --> 00:27:45,093
My marriage is over.

432
00:27:45,094 --> 00:27:47,663
Chris told me last
night he wants a divorce.

433
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,661
I had to say it out loud.

434
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,829
I've been feeling like
I'm trapped in a nightmare.

435
00:28:05,493 --> 00:28:09,195
I try to voice what's
going on inside me,

436
00:28:09,962 --> 00:28:12,262
try to get a sense of reality,

437
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:15,461
like a sense of power,

438
00:28:15,462 --> 00:28:16,993
like I have control back.

439
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:18,794
A sense of freedom?

440
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:20,828
Exactly.

441
00:28:22,963 --> 00:28:24,194
Just a moment
ago, I was about to

442
00:28:24,195 --> 00:28:26,196
completely give up.

443
00:28:27,928 --> 00:28:30,063
I felt so...

444
00:28:30,995 --> 00:28:33,062
so useless.

445
00:28:34,662 --> 00:28:39,827
Ever been in a store,
suddenly you have to go

446
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:42,860
and you rush as fast as you can

447
00:28:42,861 --> 00:28:45,194
to end up not making it in time?

448
00:28:45,195 --> 00:28:47,795
You have a accident
right on your clothes.

449
00:28:47,796 --> 00:28:49,694
What do you do?

450
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:52,361
Who can you call in
a situation like that?

451
00:28:52,362 --> 00:28:55,993
You have to walk out in
whatever didn't get soiled.

452
00:28:55,994 --> 00:28:58,229
And whatever shred
of dignity you had

453
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:02,195
is left behind the stall doors.

454
00:29:02,196 --> 00:29:05,162
Miss Malaina, I'm sorry.

455
00:29:05,163 --> 00:29:06,995
I didn't know.

456
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,496
No, don't apologize.

457
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,262
Like I said, speaking about it

458
00:29:10,263 --> 00:29:11,962
gives me power over it.

459
00:29:11,963 --> 00:29:14,996
You are a strong,
phenomenal woman.

460
00:29:14,997 --> 00:29:17,594
You've always
been so kind to me.

461
00:29:17,595 --> 00:29:20,929
I was hired when you
first started getting sick.

462
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,262
And you never let it change

463
00:29:22,263 --> 00:29:24,228
how you treated
people around you.

464
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,762
You were my silent mentor.

465
00:29:26,763 --> 00:29:29,262
I'm glad you were there.

466
00:29:29,263 --> 00:29:31,630
Tiffany, you're my angel.

467
00:29:32,363 --> 00:29:35,930
Thank you. It means so much.

468
00:29:37,564 --> 00:29:41,362
Wow. I feel like a big sister.

469
00:29:42,863 --> 00:29:44,164
You're welcome.

470
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:48,763
Mr. Owens loves you.
He will see that.

471
00:29:48,764 --> 00:29:52,663
Hopefully sooner than later.

472
00:29:57,997 --> 00:29:59,696
I'd better go.

473
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,829
Yeah. Right.

474
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,762
With Chris out of town,

475
00:30:02,763 --> 00:30:04,595
I don't know what to
do in this big house.

476
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:06,961
When people come over, I don't
know how to let 'em leave.

477
00:30:06,962 --> 00:30:08,063
By the way, you look beautiful.

478
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:09,896
What's the occasion?

479
00:30:09,897 --> 00:30:13,029
I told you. You inspire me.

480
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,862
So I just had my
first photo shoot.

481
00:30:16,863 --> 00:30:18,861
Congratulations! With who?

482
00:30:18,862 --> 00:30:20,596
An agency I met at the party.

483
00:30:20,597 --> 00:30:22,896
I'll call you with
the details later.

484
00:30:22,897 --> 00:30:23,931
Because...

485
00:30:24,464 --> 00:30:28,696
I'm meeting with my
boyfriend right now.

486
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:31,629
Ok, well call, I wanna
hear all about it.

487
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,863
And about that
boyfriend stuff too.

488
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:35,232
Ok, I'll call you later.

489
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,297
Hey Phae, baby, you're looking
real good in that outfit.

490
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:55,096
Where you about to go?

491
00:30:55,097 --> 00:30:56,230
What you doing here?

492
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:57,163
I've been calling and you ain't

493
00:30:57,164 --> 00:30:58,197
answering none of my calls.

494
00:30:58,198 --> 00:30:58,997
You know what, I lost my phone.

495
00:30:58,998 --> 00:31:00,696
But what's up?

496
00:31:00,697 --> 00:31:02,131
You. Still ain't got paid
for what I gave you yesterday.

497
00:31:02,132 --> 00:31:03,797
It's like that?

498
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:04,462
How much I owe you?

499
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:05,596
I don't want your money.

500
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,930
We can talk about what
you owe me upstairs.

501
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:07,897
Dude, you're drunk. Move.

502
00:31:07,898 --> 00:31:08,863
Man, you're playing games.

503
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:10,097
One minute you're all over me,

504
00:31:10,098 --> 00:31:11,063
now you're acting
like you don't know

505
00:31:11,064 --> 00:31:11,829
what's about to go down.

506
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,265
-Dude, you're drunk...

507
00:31:13,864 --> 00:31:15,030
Don't you ever put
your hands on me

508
00:31:15,031 --> 00:31:17,864
like that disrespecting
me, you understand?

509
00:31:17,865 --> 00:31:18,898
What's up, y'all?

510
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:20,098
Phaedra, you ok?

511
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:21,329
She all right, man,
this don't concern you.

512
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,864
I'm not talking to
you, I'm talking to her.

513
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:24,198
Phaedra, you ok?

514
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:26,197
Tell the man. You're ok, right?

515
00:31:26,198 --> 00:31:27,763
No. He just tried to choke me.

516
00:31:27,764 --> 00:31:29,566
-Get over here...

517
00:31:36,931 --> 00:31:38,330
Where did you go?

518
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:40,797
I went to go downstairs
and talk to Officer Thomas.

519
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:41,763
You ok?

520
00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:43,998
Yeah, I just kinda,
you know, feel weird.

521
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:44,965
Wanna lay down.

522
00:31:44,966 --> 00:31:45,898
Did he hurt you?

523
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:48,030
No, baby, I'm ok.

524
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,131
Look, I need to talk to you.

525
00:31:50,132 --> 00:31:52,566
-Ok.
-Go.

526
00:31:54,732 --> 00:31:55,797
I'm glad you're all right.

527
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:57,165
Thank you, Mikkey. Good night.

528
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,964
-Good night.
-Good night, baby.

529
00:31:58,965 --> 00:31:59,998
What's up?

530
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:01,233
Look.

531
00:32:01,665 --> 00:32:02,832
I just need to talk
to you because I

532
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:05,665
honestly I can't keep
this bottled up any more.

533
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:06,732
I know I'm not
perfect, and I know that

534
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:08,664
I've made mistakes
when I was younger.

535
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:10,897
And I should have been an
example for you but I wasn't.

536
00:32:10,898 --> 00:32:12,097
I messed that up.

537
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:14,230
But I can't watch you
hurt another day, Phae.

538
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:16,032
Tammy, not another
one of your lectures

539
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:18,331
about my lifestyle
and what I do,

540
00:32:18,332 --> 00:32:21,632
who I date and all of that,
I mean going to church.

541
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:23,466
I'm not you, Tammy,
I'm not ready.

542
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:25,430
I'm not, I promise you
I'm not lecturing you.

543
00:32:25,431 --> 00:32:26,630
I just wanna talk to you...

544
00:32:26,631 --> 00:32:28,499
-You know, can we
talk tomorrow, 'cause...

545
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,199
Ok, Phae.

546
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,532
Good night.

547
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:31,967
Good night.

548
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:37,599
Jesus, please.

549
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:43,065
I didn't even notice
he locked up everything.

550
00:32:43,066 --> 00:32:45,299
Really? That's wonderful.

551
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,165
Maybe we can go out tonight.

552
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:50,998
Drinks on me.!

553
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:53,065
I don't drink.

554
00:32:53,066 --> 00:32:55,265
What? Since when?

555
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:56,832
This morning.

556
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:57,965
Child, please.

557
00:32:57,966 --> 00:32:59,298
I'm serious.

558
00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:01,032
You really gonna stop this time?

559
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:02,766
You said that so
many times before,

560
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:05,533
and you always wound
up drinking again.

561
00:33:05,534 --> 00:33:07,632
I don't wanna drink anymore.

562
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:11,766
Thanks for the vote of
confidence, but yes, I am.

563
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:12,998
Where are you?

564
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:14,933
Calm down. I'm outside.

565
00:33:14,934 --> 00:33:16,568
I'm hanging up.

566
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:38,432
I mean, what was he thinking?

567
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,801
If you had an emergency,
how would you get around?

568
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:46,566
I mean, I thought Chris
was one of the good ones.

569
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,165
I guess he said you
ain't taking nothing

570
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:49,466
while he's gone.

571
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:51,632
I'm not stealing it.
We're still married.

572
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:54,866
I just need some
transportation while he's gone.

573
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,366
Let mine lock me out.

574
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,099
He'll come back and
the house will be gone.

575
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,801
Stop it.

576
00:34:02,201 --> 00:34:05,300
Ok, so how are you
getting in here?

577
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:07,465
This don't make no sense.

578
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:09,067
Look at all this opulence.

579
00:34:09,068 --> 00:34:10,799
And you don't have
a key to nothing?

580
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,401
I'm not leaving him. The
keys are in the garage.

581
00:34:14,402 --> 00:34:16,867
It feels like hellfire out here.

582
00:34:16,868 --> 00:34:17,832
I'm going in.

583
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:18,967
Hold on, I got an idea.

584
00:34:18,968 --> 00:34:21,200
Give me your shoe. Come on.

585
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:23,500
You what? For what?

586
00:34:23,501 --> 00:34:24,899
Just give me the freaking shoe.

587
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,234
Dang!

588
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:31,666
Now that's Christian
Louis Vuitton in your hand.

589
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:32,699
Now don't...

590
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,602
do nothing stupid.

591
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:42,136
I tell you. Life
throws you curves.

592
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:47,135
You can be intimidated
by the spin or the speed

593
00:36:47,136 --> 00:36:49,070
and foul out like a wuss,

594
00:36:49,071 --> 00:36:51,136
or brace yourself.

595
00:36:51,137 --> 00:36:55,902
Watch it closely, and
whack it out of the park.

596
00:36:55,903 --> 00:36:59,604
It's too late, I already
told her I want a divorce.

597
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:05,102
You told your
sick, depressed wife

598
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:08,801
of seven years
you want a divorce?

599
00:37:08,802 --> 00:37:10,803
Yeah.

600
00:37:11,404 --> 00:37:12,903
Pazzo!

601
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,670
I tell you something.

602
00:37:15,671 --> 00:37:20,002
I have cancer. Gail is
at every appointment,

603
00:37:20,003 --> 00:37:22,103
treatment or surgery.

604
00:37:22,104 --> 00:37:25,336
Sometimes, I feel like
I'm holding her back.

605
00:37:25,337 --> 00:37:28,137
She is beautiful
and full of life.

606
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,037
But I wake up, and
see her every morning.

607
00:37:31,038 --> 00:37:33,936
And I'm so grateful
she is there.

608
00:37:33,937 --> 00:37:37,903
I tell you, this.
Malaina loves you.

609
00:37:37,904 --> 00:37:43,271
This chasing skirts is for the.

610
00:37:44,937 --> 00:37:47,605
The decision is yours.

611
00:38:45,805 --> 00:38:48,073
Why'd you leave?

612
00:38:48,605 --> 00:38:52,037
I wasn't much in a
social mood tonight.

613
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:55,272
Is there something I can do?

614
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:02,606
What, are you not
in the mood for me?

615
00:39:06,038 --> 00:39:08,571
This ain't gonna happen.

616
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:09,938
What now?

617
00:39:09,939 --> 00:39:11,972
This ain't what I want.

618
00:39:11,973 --> 00:39:13,871
When did you decide that?

619
00:39:13,872 --> 00:39:15,072
Why am I here?

620
00:39:15,672 --> 00:39:18,637
You're right. I'm gonna
get you another room.

621
00:39:18,638 --> 00:39:20,205
I thought we were
gonna be together.

622
00:39:20,206 --> 00:39:21,971
You need to decide who you want.

623
00:39:21,972 --> 00:39:23,340
I have.

624
00:39:26,705 --> 00:39:28,572
You stay away from me.

625
00:39:33,574 --> 00:39:37,339
You hear me? You
stay away from me.

626
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:45,005
? Jesus

627
00:39:45,006 --> 00:39:48,072
? Bless that wonderful name of

628
00:39:48,073 --> 00:39:51,038
? Jesus

629
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,304
? No other name I know

630
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:57,906
? Yes, there's
joy in the name of

631
00:39:57,907 --> 00:40:00,638
? Name of Jesus

632
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:04,807
? Yes, there's
joy in the name of

633
00:40:06,006 --> 00:40:08,274
Hallelujah.

634
00:40:17,773 --> 00:40:19,672
Someone be set free.

635
00:40:19,673 --> 00:40:21,771
Father God, that someone
be redeemed and delivered.

636
00:40:21,772 --> 00:40:25,838
Hallelujah. Hallelujah,
become a saved child,

637
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:26,972
son of God.

638
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:29,071
Father God, we thank
You for salvation today.

639
00:40:29,072 --> 00:40:31,357
We thank You Lord
Jehovah that You, Lord,

640
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:33,605
given us a mind to
wanna seek You, Lord.

641
00:40:33,606 --> 00:40:35,273
Praise you and
glorify Your name.

642
00:40:35,274 --> 00:40:40,740
To live this life
with joy in your life.

643
00:40:41,674 --> 00:40:44,772
So we find that
that's why some people

644
00:40:44,773 --> 00:40:47,939
are having a hard time trying

645
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:53,607
to come to reality of what
life is offering them right now.

646
00:40:54,673 --> 00:40:59,838
But Jesus has a way
for you this day.

647
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,805
He has a way for you this day.

648
00:41:01,806 --> 00:41:05,773
Through everything,
through everything.

649
00:41:05,774 --> 00:41:09,273
All that we're doing and
all that we're going through,

650
00:41:09,274 --> 00:41:12,274
Jesus has that way for us.

651
00:41:15,308 --> 00:41:17,339
Just hear Him.

652
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:22,007
He has not allowed any
trial to come upon us

653
00:41:22,008 --> 00:41:24,640
that, temptation to come

654
00:41:24,641 --> 00:41:26,905
that there is not
a way to escape.

655
00:41:26,906 --> 00:41:31,308
He won't let no more come
upon you than you can bear.

656
00:41:31,309 --> 00:41:34,039
He won't let no more come
upon you than you can bear.

657
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,539
And if it's there,

658
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,006
then God has a way in your trial

659
00:41:40,007 --> 00:41:41,942
for you to get out.

660
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,339
He has a way in your
trial for you to get out.

661
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:48,274
And so it's up to us today

662
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:52,007
to realize I wanna come to God.

663
00:41:52,841 --> 00:41:54,374
I wanna bring everything to God.

664
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:57,340
In order for you to do that,

665
00:41:57,341 --> 00:42:00,274
you have to learn to forgive

666
00:42:00,808 --> 00:42:02,308
and ask forgiveness.

667
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:04,473
Ask for forgiveness, ask God

668
00:42:04,474 --> 00:42:06,808
to forgive you of your sin,

669
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:10,873
ask God to change the
way you're thinking,

670
00:42:10,874 --> 00:42:13,909
and then forgive yourself.

671
00:42:14,975 --> 00:42:18,310
See, forgive yourself.

672
00:42:21,974 --> 00:42:23,207
Excuse me, Tammy?

673
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,374
Hey, Sherrod.

674
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:28,039
Boy, I'm so sorry for running
out on you the other night.

675
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,942
That was completely rude of me.

676
00:42:29,943 --> 00:42:30,840
Was it something I said or did?

677
00:42:30,841 --> 00:42:32,109
No, no, no, it.

678
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,273
Trust me, it has
nothing to do with you.

679
00:42:33,274 --> 00:42:34,641
It's all me.

680
00:42:35,276 --> 00:42:37,873
But maybe we could talk
about this another time.

681
00:42:37,874 --> 00:42:39,774
Yes, please. Here's my card.

682
00:42:39,775 --> 00:42:44,474
Ok, well, I will definitely
be giving you a call.

683
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:46,374
Ok. Can I walk you to your car?

684
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:48,675
No, we're right outside
the door, but thank you.

685
00:42:48,676 --> 00:42:49,707
Such a gentleman.

686
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:51,239
All right. Well,
we'll be talking later?

687
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,041
Indeed we will. Bye.

688
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:55,776
Bye.

689
00:42:55,808 --> 00:42:57,742
What was that?

690
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:01,342
Nosy! That's the
man I met on Friday.

691
00:43:08,675 --> 00:43:12,107
Phae, you ok?
You need anything?

692
00:43:12,108 --> 00:43:13,275
No.

693
00:43:13,776 --> 00:43:17,341
Hey. I saw Thomas downstairs.

694
00:43:17,342 --> 00:43:18,075
He told me what happened.

695
00:43:18,076 --> 00:43:19,841
Are you all right?

696
00:43:19,842 --> 00:43:21,676
That bastard tried to rape me.

697
00:43:21,677 --> 00:43:23,975
But he didn't.
And he tried twice.

698
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,475
But to no avail
was he successful.

699
00:43:26,476 --> 00:43:28,309
Sis, you can't really think

700
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,842
God's not looking out for you.

701
00:43:30,843 --> 00:43:32,174
You were right about one thing.

702
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:34,675
I've really made
a mess of my life.

703
00:43:34,676 --> 00:43:38,075
No, Phae. We all make mistakes.

704
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:39,543
Hear me when I say that.

705
00:43:39,544 --> 00:43:41,376
Don't beat yourself
up over this.

706
00:43:41,377 --> 00:43:42,308
It's not worth it.

707
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:44,076
That's easy for you to say.

708
00:43:44,077 --> 00:43:46,008
You got a good
life, a great house,

709
00:43:46,009 --> 00:43:48,375
a good job, and Mikkey.

710
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,942
You got somebody that you love

711
00:43:49,943 --> 00:43:51,742
that loves you back.

712
00:43:51,743 --> 00:43:54,742
And you have us. And
we love you, Phaedra.

713
00:43:54,743 --> 00:43:57,910
Now stop. Get up, let's
get out of here, ok?

714
00:43:57,911 --> 00:43:59,975
Come on. It's too
stuffy in here.

715
00:43:59,976 --> 00:44:01,909
I'll be out in a minute.

716
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:03,210
Ok.

717
00:44:16,644 --> 00:44:18,342
You should have
been at Bible study.

718
00:44:18,343 --> 00:44:21,176
Pastor Jakes was on it,
girl, about forgiveness.

719
00:44:21,177 --> 00:44:22,108
Broke some chains, girl...

720
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:23,375
-Tammy.
-What?

721
00:44:23,376 --> 00:44:24,875
You know I don't buy into
that forgiveness crap.

722
00:44:24,876 --> 00:44:26,210
It's a bunch of bullcrap.

723
00:44:26,211 --> 00:44:27,944
I ain't gon' ever forgive Vern

724
00:44:27,945 --> 00:44:29,143
for the stuff he
did to me today.

725
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:31,809
And he is back in jail,
where he belongs, Phae.

726
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:34,009
Don't let that man
rob you of a happy life

727
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,577
because of that one incident.

728
00:44:35,578 --> 00:44:36,776
One incident?

729
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:38,343
What about the man
that killed my baby,

730
00:44:38,344 --> 00:44:39,943
should I forgive
him, too, Tammy?

731
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:41,210
Listen, you can go on about this

732
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,676
forgiveness mumbo jumbo,
you got your child.

733
00:44:43,677 --> 00:44:45,343
I was young, I know,
but I would have

734
00:44:45,344 --> 00:44:47,009
taken care of my baby.

735
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,875
I would have done right by mine.

736
00:44:48,876 --> 00:44:50,977
-Phae, you
really need to let...

737
00:44:50,978 --> 00:44:52,277
No, Tammy, you
need to go to hell

738
00:44:52,278 --> 00:44:54,509
and take forgiveness with you.

739
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,977
Ok. Well I'm gonna
go pray for us both.

740
00:44:56,978 --> 00:44:57,977
Ok, do that.

741
00:44:57,978 --> 00:45:00,245
Some Spirit's dwindling in here.

742
00:45:05,978 --> 00:45:07,676
Make yourself comfortable.

743
00:45:07,677 --> 00:45:10,043
I love your home, Malaina.

744
00:45:10,044 --> 00:45:11,742
The light fixtures are gorgeous.

745
00:45:11,743 --> 00:45:12,878
Thank you.

746
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:14,844
I pray I can have one
like this of my own soon.

747
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:16,744
You will. Just keep praying.

748
00:45:16,745 --> 00:45:19,578
You can have anything if
you just believe in it.

749
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:22,876
Well look at you, on the
Jesus bandwagon, girl.

750
00:45:22,877 --> 00:45:24,409
Hallelujah!

751
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:27,011
Tammy, I feel so much peace now.

752
00:45:27,012 --> 00:45:29,376
I'm not worried or afraid.

753
00:45:29,377 --> 00:45:31,844
I've been reading and praying.

754
00:45:31,845 --> 00:45:33,976
I just know that by
His stripes I'm healed,

755
00:45:33,977 --> 00:45:35,644
and my life is in His hands.

756
00:45:35,645 --> 00:45:37,676
I wish I could get my
sister to believe that.

757
00:45:37,677 --> 00:45:39,377
I've been praying on
peace for both of us,

758
00:45:39,378 --> 00:45:42,778
and it's, and the pastor
was talking about secrets

759
00:45:42,779 --> 00:45:43,811
and finding freedom from them,

760
00:45:43,812 --> 00:45:45,810
and then I was watching
Oprah on some show,

761
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:49,143
and she had Bishop TD Jakes

762
00:45:49,144 --> 00:45:50,878
talking about forgiveness.

763
00:45:50,879 --> 00:45:51,843
Forgiveness?

764
00:45:51,844 --> 00:45:53,442
Yes. Honey, how you
have to let go of it,

765
00:45:53,443 --> 00:45:54,677
or deprive you of a happy life,

766
00:45:54,678 --> 00:45:58,276
and bitterness becoming
like a cancer if you let it.

767
00:45:58,277 --> 00:46:00,843
It's really hitting a little
too close to heart for me,

768
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:03,344
and I don't know what to do or

769
00:46:03,345 --> 00:46:04,544
how I'm gonna handle it.

770
00:46:04,545 --> 00:46:06,411
Is there anything that I can do?

771
00:46:06,412 --> 00:46:08,945
No. Thank you, but no.

772
00:46:08,946 --> 00:46:11,043
It's something I
gotta do on my own.

773
00:46:11,044 --> 00:46:13,177
No, you need to pray about it.

774
00:46:13,178 --> 00:46:15,111
And if there's
anything you need,

775
00:46:15,112 --> 00:46:18,277
any help or anything,
just let me know.

776
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:20,210
I will. But you,

777
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:21,811
need to pray and talk
about it with your husband.

778
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:24,612
You and Chris need to pray
about it, and talk about it.

779
00:46:24,613 --> 00:46:26,044
Just another little
bump in the road.

780
00:46:26,045 --> 00:46:27,110
Y'all be fine.

781
00:46:27,111 --> 00:46:27,912
I know.

782
00:46:27,913 --> 00:46:29,680
Y'all be fine.

783
00:46:29,878 --> 00:46:31,211
Thank you.

784
00:46:31,212 --> 00:46:33,743
You're welcome.
Glad we met, honey.

785
00:46:33,744 --> 00:46:34,945
Me too.

786
00:46:34,946 --> 00:46:36,879
Thank you, Jesus.

787
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,946
Sorry, excuse me.

788
00:46:39,779 --> 00:46:41,145
Uncle Nate!

789
00:46:41,146 --> 00:46:44,644
My God, baby girl! Look at you!

790
00:46:44,645 --> 00:46:48,544
You are so beautiful
and all grown up!

791
00:46:48,545 --> 00:46:49,644
Thanks.

792
00:46:49,645 --> 00:46:50,645
I guess your mother
cut back on the salt

793
00:46:50,646 --> 00:46:52,180
and started using fertilizer?

794
00:46:53,012 --> 00:46:54,344
You all right? -Yeah, I'm fine.

795
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:56,777
-You ok? You sure?
-Yeah.

796
00:46:56,778 --> 00:46:57,811
Yeah?

797
00:46:57,812 --> 00:46:59,579
Yeah. I'm gonna tell you
about it in just a minute.

798
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,812
Excuse me, Miss Richards.
We're pretty much done here.

799
00:47:03,813 --> 00:47:05,511
If you or your sister
have any questions

800
00:47:05,512 --> 00:47:07,712
going forward, here's my card.

801
00:47:07,713 --> 00:47:10,044
Ok. I'll definitely
have Phaedra call you

802
00:47:10,045 --> 00:47:11,145
if there's any problems.

803
00:47:11,146 --> 00:47:12,012
Thank you, Detective...

804
00:47:12,013 --> 00:47:13,178
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

805
00:47:13,179 --> 00:47:14,712
Detective? What's going on here?

806
00:47:14,713 --> 00:47:16,412
I'll fill you in about
it later, Uncle Nate.

807
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:17,378
Thank you for stopping by.

808
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:19,647
Thank you.
Have a good night.

809
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,779
Long story, Uncle Nate.
And it's Phaedra. Not me.

810
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,844
So they haven't
arrested this punk yet?

811
00:47:29,845 --> 00:47:31,778
I mean, they did, but
he got out and came back.

812
00:47:31,779 --> 00:47:34,680
Yeah? Well, I wish he
comes around while I'm here.

813
00:47:34,681 --> 00:47:36,315
Uncle Nate...

814
00:47:37,347 --> 00:47:38,778
What's wrong, baby?

815
00:47:38,779 --> 00:47:40,279
You know what, when
you were a little girl

816
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,279
you would always drop
your head just like that

817
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,512
when you had something to say

818
00:47:43,513 --> 00:47:45,812
and you didn't know
quite how to say it.

819
00:47:45,813 --> 00:47:48,081
So I know something's wrong.

820
00:47:51,046 --> 00:47:52,980
Unc,

821
00:47:53,713 --> 00:47:55,212
you're the only person
I could tell this to.

822
00:47:55,213 --> 00:47:56,146
Ok, whoa, whoa, whoa.

823
00:47:56,147 --> 00:47:58,214
Am I going to need a drink?

824
00:47:58,614 --> 00:48:01,247
I'm kidding, baby,
you all right?

825
00:48:01,248 --> 00:48:02,946
Listen, this is
something serious, right?

826
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:05,080
You need to tell me.

827
00:48:06,613 --> 00:48:08,512
Do you remember when
Phae and I were teens

828
00:48:08,513 --> 00:48:10,281
and we got in that car accident?

829
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,748
Well...

830
00:48:13,881 --> 00:48:16,348
I did something bad.

831
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:38,946
Mom, I'm home.

832
00:48:38,947 --> 00:48:41,281
Ok, baby, I'm in the kitchen.

833
00:48:44,848 --> 00:48:46,181
I'm hungry. Can I get a snack?

834
00:48:46,182 --> 00:48:48,315
Yeah. Did you have
a good day, baby?

835
00:48:55,447 --> 00:48:57,313
Mom, we have a project
for Black History.

836
00:48:57,314 --> 00:48:58,681
I need some family photos.

837
00:48:58,682 --> 00:49:00,981
They say whoever brings
in the oldest photo

838
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:02,481
gets a day off from homework.

839
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:04,949
Can I get the photo
album out of your room?

840
00:49:05,913 --> 00:49:07,146
Hello, Mom?

841
00:49:07,147 --> 00:49:08,648
What, baby, I said
you could have a snack

842
00:49:08,649 --> 00:49:11,582
nothing too heavy, 'cause
you won't eat dinner.

843
00:49:13,581 --> 00:49:15,181
And we're having a guest later,

844
00:49:15,182 --> 00:49:16,246
so make sure you hurry up
and finish your homework

845
00:49:16,247 --> 00:49:18,282
so you can straighten up.

846
00:49:58,481 --> 00:49:59,181
Mom.

847
00:49:59,182 --> 00:50:00,048
What?

848
00:50:00,049 --> 00:50:01,615
Can I ask you a question?

849
00:50:01,616 --> 00:50:02,815
Not right now, baby, I'm
trying to finish dinner.

850
00:50:02,816 --> 00:50:03,847
Real quick.

851
00:50:03,848 --> 00:50:05,515
What, baby, what is it?

852
00:50:05,516 --> 00:50:07,881
Who is Jonathan Anthony Walker?

853
00:50:07,882 --> 00:50:10,015
And why's my name...

854
00:50:10,783 --> 00:50:12,781
Phaedra, slow down!

855
00:50:12,782 --> 00:50:14,348
Baby girl, I've got this.

856
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:17,146
Slow your butt down
and quit playing.

857
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,881
Will you tell your
mama to stop worrying?

858
00:50:19,882 --> 00:50:20,982
Aunty gon' get us home safe.

859
00:50:20,983 --> 00:50:22,182
Keep your eyes on the road

860
00:50:22,183 --> 00:50:24,848
or pull over and I'll drive.

861
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:28,848
My bad. Let me stop.

862
00:50:52,815 --> 00:50:55,584
God, what am I gonna do?

863
00:50:55,983 --> 00:50:59,084
I'm trying so hard.

864
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:06,015
God, God, please,
please, please God.

865
00:51:07,516 --> 00:51:09,347
Mom. Mama?

866
00:51:09,348 --> 00:51:11,816
Yeah. Hold on, Mikayla.

867
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:19,316
What's up, babe?

868
00:51:19,317 --> 00:51:20,714
Mom, are you ok?

869
00:51:20,715 --> 00:51:22,250
Yeah.

870
00:51:23,816 --> 00:51:25,816
Mommy's fine. I'm fine.

871
00:51:25,817 --> 00:51:26,716
Ok.

872
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:28,915
It's not, it's not
something I can talk

873
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:31,717
to you about right now, but...

874
00:51:31,718 --> 00:51:33,585
Why, what's wrong?

875
00:51:33,949 --> 00:51:35,783
You know Mommy loves you, right?

876
00:51:35,784 --> 00:51:36,615
Very, very, very much

877
00:51:36,616 --> 00:51:39,217
I would do anything
for you, Mikayla.

878
00:51:40,215 --> 00:51:42,949
Let's just talk about
it another time, ok?

879
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:43,981
Ok.

880
00:51:43,982 --> 00:51:45,849
Go finish your homework.

881
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:46,952
I love you.

882
00:51:58,584 --> 00:51:59,783
Hey stinky.

883
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:00,750
Hey, Aunty.

884
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:01,949
What's going on? Why...

885
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:03,882
Why'd you call
me to pick you up?

886
00:52:03,883 --> 00:52:04,983
Well...

887
00:52:04,984 --> 00:52:06,151
I got suspended off the bus.

888
00:52:06,152 --> 00:52:09,415
Does your mama know?
She gon' kill you.

889
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:10,917
I know, that's why I called you.

890
00:52:10,918 --> 00:52:11,817
What is that supposed to mean?

891
00:52:11,818 --> 00:52:13,050
You'll just yell for a bit,

892
00:52:13,051 --> 00:52:14,683
but Mama, she'll just
take it overboard.

893
00:52:14,684 --> 00:52:15,882
Well, that's true.

894
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:18,517
So what happened, why'd you
get suspended off the bus?

895
00:52:18,518 --> 00:52:20,216
'Cause the bus driver's
just such a liar.

896
00:52:20,217 --> 00:52:21,716
Girl, watch your mouth.

897
00:52:21,717 --> 00:52:23,649
You know not to disrespect
your elders like that.

898
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,050
What did he do?

899
00:52:25,051 --> 00:52:26,249
Well...

900
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,785
This girl Carrisa
has a fight with me

901
00:52:27,786 --> 00:52:29,417
every day on the bus.

902
00:52:29,418 --> 00:52:32,018
I told him, but he
didn't do anything.

903
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:34,716
So today, I sat at
the back of the bus

904
00:52:34,717 --> 00:52:37,283
and she told on me,
he told the principal

905
00:52:37,284 --> 00:52:38,583
that I sat back
just so I could sit

906
00:52:38,584 --> 00:52:42,317
by this boy named Devonte,
so I called him a l...

907
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:45,683
a storyteller, so
they wrote me up.

908
00:52:45,684 --> 00:52:48,783
I'm a veteran.
Don't try to play me.

909
00:52:48,784 --> 00:52:49,784
You really went back there

910
00:52:49,785 --> 00:52:51,183
to sit with that little
boy Devonte, didn't you?

911
00:52:51,184 --> 00:52:53,183
I did, but...

912
00:52:53,184 --> 00:52:55,219
he don't like her.

913
00:52:56,819 --> 00:53:00,017
-See, I told you I couldn't two
-step.

914
00:53:00,018 --> 00:53:01,150
You sure did a good job stepping

915
00:53:01,151 --> 00:53:03,818
all over my feet.

916
00:53:04,885 --> 00:53:05,918
You ok?

917
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,352
Yeah. Yeah.

918
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:10,717
I'm glad I met you.

919
00:53:10,718 --> 00:53:12,650
I finally feel like
I'm living my life

920
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:14,851
and not someone else's
when I'm with you.

921
00:53:14,852 --> 00:53:17,652
And it's nice. It's really nice.

922
00:53:19,986 --> 00:53:21,017
-Maybe we...

923
00:53:21,018 --> 00:53:22,252
Yeah. We should clear this up.

924
00:53:28,986 --> 00:53:29,984
Sorry.

925
00:53:29,985 --> 00:53:31,085
Did I do something wrong?

926
00:53:31,086 --> 00:53:32,218
No, it's not you, it's me.

927
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:34,253
I'm so sorry. I just...

928
00:53:37,051 --> 00:53:39,652
Please don't leave like that.

929
00:53:41,152 --> 00:53:44,652
Ok. Sit down. I...

930
00:53:46,286 --> 00:53:47,818
I have something to tell you.

931
00:53:47,819 --> 00:53:52,484
So, Aunty, my name is Mikayla
Dejounay Walker, right?

932
00:53:52,485 --> 00:53:53,885
Yeah. Walker's your last name.

933
00:53:53,886 --> 00:53:54,885
That's your dad's last name

934
00:53:54,886 --> 00:53:56,783
and then your first
name is Mikayla,

935
00:53:56,784 --> 00:53:59,084
which is in honor of
my daughter that died

936
00:53:59,085 --> 00:54:00,150
in a car accident.

937
00:54:00,151 --> 00:54:01,617
She would have
been about your age.

938
00:54:01,618 --> 00:54:03,951
So then why on my
birth certificate

939
00:54:03,952 --> 00:54:06,885
it says Mikayla Dejounay Craig,

940
00:54:06,886 --> 00:54:08,519
and on the death certificate,

941
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,918
it says Charlotte
Anthony Walker?

942
00:54:10,919 --> 00:54:12,751
Who is that?

943
00:54:12,752 --> 00:54:15,751
What? Mikayla, where did
you find these certificates?

944
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,119
In Mama's photo album.

945
00:54:25,386 --> 00:54:26,984
Where's the photo album, Tammy?

946
00:54:26,985 --> 00:54:28,519
But...

947
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,218
Where's the photo album?

948
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:30,386
What's going on?

949
00:54:30,387 --> 00:54:31,619
This ain't got
nothing to do with you.

950
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,618
Phaedra, calm down,
let me explain.

951
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:34,086
Know what, you a low down, lying

952
00:54:34,087 --> 00:54:36,152
church-going baby stealer?

953
00:54:36,153 --> 00:54:37,952
What a hypocrite!

954
00:54:37,953 --> 00:54:38,885
13 years you let me believe

955
00:54:38,886 --> 00:54:40,784
my baby died in that accident?

956
00:54:40,785 --> 00:54:41,585
I'm sorry.

957
00:54:41,586 --> 00:54:42,852
And the insurance money, Tammy?

958
00:54:42,853 --> 00:54:43,819
-I'm sorry...

959
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:44,952
-You swapped my baby!
-It wasn't like that!

960
00:54:44,953 --> 00:54:45,985
What was it like?

961
00:54:45,986 --> 00:54:47,518
You were in a coma, Phae.

962
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:49,185
I took her out of the hospital
and they gave her to me.

963
00:54:49,186 --> 00:54:50,853
They didn't know you
were gonna make it...

964
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:52,686
But I did. I'm here!

965
00:54:52,687 --> 00:54:55,718
And by then, Phae, I'd had
her for six months Phae!

966
00:54:55,719 --> 00:54:58,151
I loved her and
she loved me back.

967
00:54:58,152 --> 00:54:59,852
She was mine now, I
couldn't just give her up.

968
00:54:59,853 --> 00:55:02,620
But you let me cry
thinking my baby was dead,

969
00:55:02,621 --> 00:55:06,754
like it was my fault I
killed my own child, Tammy?

970
00:55:07,919 --> 00:55:09,185
You killed mine.

971
00:55:09,186 --> 00:55:11,053
My baby died that night.

972
00:55:11,054 --> 00:55:12,486
It was my baby.

973
00:55:12,487 --> 00:55:14,952
I told you to slow down
and you didn't listen, Phae.

974
00:55:14,953 --> 00:55:16,819
You took my child from me.

975
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,920
So, right, I took yours.

976
00:55:17,921 --> 00:55:19,220
I didn't kill your baby.

977
00:55:19,221 --> 00:55:20,719
That man that hit
us killed your child,

978
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,751
the one you keep
telling me to forgive.

979
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:23,586
That's not true.

980
00:55:23,587 --> 00:55:25,986
So you forgive him
now, church lady.

981
00:55:25,987 --> 00:55:26,885
Mikayla, let's go.

982
00:55:26,886 --> 00:55:28,187
No, you're not taking my baby.

983
00:55:28,188 --> 00:55:29,886
You're not taking...

984
00:55:29,887 --> 00:55:31,353
No, Mikayla!

985
00:55:31,354 --> 00:55:34,955
No, please don't take my baby!

986
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:13,655
Mikkey, you all right?

987
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:17,721
Look, I know this is
crazy for you, and,

988
00:56:17,722 --> 00:56:20,953
I want you to understand
this is crazy for me, too.

989
00:56:20,954 --> 00:56:22,686
I'm gonna go in
and take a shower.

990
00:56:22,687 --> 00:56:24,154
You can go to the
vending machine

991
00:56:24,155 --> 00:56:25,354
and get you something
to eat if you want

992
00:56:25,355 --> 00:56:27,255
and then we can talk
it out, all right?

993
00:56:31,954 --> 00:56:33,421
Don't be too long, ok?

994
00:56:33,422 --> 00:56:34,788
Ok.

995
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:27,154
Now who is that on
my door like that?

996
00:57:27,155 --> 00:57:27,989
Where she at?

997
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:28,987
-Who?
-Mikayla.

998
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:30,187
She's not here.

999
00:57:30,188 --> 00:57:31,254
Don't play dumb with me, Tammy.

1000
00:57:31,956 --> 00:57:33,154
-If I find out
she's here, I swear...

1001
00:57:33,155 --> 00:57:35,323
-Girl, I...

1002
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:17,189
Mikkey? Mikayla.

1003
00:58:17,589 --> 00:58:20,289
Mikayla. Mikkey.

1004
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:24,324
Mikayla? Mikkey?

1005
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:28,154
Mikayla, what are
you doing out here?

1006
00:58:28,155 --> 00:58:29,689
I don't know what to do.

1007
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:32,889
My mama's my aunt,
and my aunty is my mom.

1008
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:34,323
This is too crazy.

1009
00:58:34,324 --> 00:58:37,122
I love you both, but my mom,
I cannot stop loving her.

1010
00:58:37,123 --> 00:58:38,856
I know, Mikayla, but this...

1011
00:58:38,857 --> 00:58:39,956
this isn't for you to work out.

1012
00:58:39,957 --> 00:58:41,222
It's between me and your mo...

1013
00:58:41,223 --> 00:58:43,054
your aunt Tammy.

1014
00:58:43,055 --> 00:58:44,723
Is she gonna get in trouble?

1015
00:58:44,724 --> 00:58:46,490
I haven't told anybody
what's going on.

1016
00:58:46,491 --> 00:58:49,756
I'm still trying to sort
it all out in my head.

1017
00:58:49,757 --> 00:58:53,323
But Mikkey, no matter
what, you're loved.

1018
00:58:53,324 --> 00:58:54,623
We're gonna figure
all of this out.

1019
00:58:54,624 --> 00:58:57,922
And running away, it's
not solving anything.

1020
00:58:57,923 --> 00:59:00,191
Come on, we need
to go, it's cold.

1021
00:59:10,791 --> 00:59:13,356
What you doing here, Kay?

1022
00:59:13,357 --> 00:59:15,289
Straight mom gonna kill you.

1023
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:16,555
Yeah, I meant to ask you,

1024
00:59:16,556 --> 00:59:18,655
like what's up with you
and your mama problem?

1025
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:21,025
Why does everybody
keep bringing that up?

1026
00:59:21,026 --> 00:59:22,657
I'm sick and tired
of hearing it.

1027
00:59:22,658 --> 00:59:25,123
I don't wanna talk
about it anymore.

1028
00:59:25,124 --> 00:59:26,490
Ok, my bad, I just
heard a lot of stuff

1029
00:59:26,491 --> 00:59:28,189
and I just wanted to see
if you wanted to talk.

1030
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,655
Man, they have female trauma?

1031
00:59:30,656 --> 00:59:32,524
I know, I heard
about her two mamas.

1032
00:59:32,525 --> 00:59:34,057
Two mamas are just sisters,

1033
00:59:34,058 --> 00:59:35,823
so you need to
calm down with that.

1034
00:59:35,824 --> 00:59:36,591
I'll bet.

1035
00:59:36,592 --> 00:59:38,056
Yeah, I bet, you need to chill.

1036
00:59:38,057 --> 00:59:39,691
Why you always kissing
up to her anyway?

1037
00:59:39,692 --> 00:59:42,491
Why you always gotta start
stuff, what you got a problem?

1038
00:59:44,792 --> 00:59:47,693
Mikayla, don't worry about it.

1039
00:59:48,926 --> 00:59:50,058
I like that.

1040
00:59:50,059 --> 00:59:50,857
It's cool.

1041
00:59:50,858 --> 00:59:52,225
Grab it.

1042
00:59:52,624 --> 00:59:54,489
You gonna smoke or stare at it?

1043
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,993
Know what I'm sayin'
get off my back.

1044
00:59:59,924 --> 01:00:01,224
Mikayla, where you gonna go?

1045
01:00:01,225 --> 01:00:04,123
I said I can't do this stuff.

1046
01:00:04,124 --> 01:00:05,924
She always thinkin'
she better than us.

1047
01:00:05,925 --> 01:00:07,592
Let that heifer go.

1048
01:00:08,492 --> 01:00:10,857
Say that to me one more time.

1049
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:13,259
I am going to beat your...

1050
01:00:34,893 --> 01:00:37,625
By His stripes, I am healed.

1051
01:00:37,891 --> 01:00:39,991
Am I interrupting something?

1052
01:00:39,992 --> 01:00:41,891
No, you're fine.

1053
01:00:41,892 --> 01:00:44,659
Well, thank you, I try.

1054
01:00:46,658 --> 01:00:49,892
No, it's just a
little doctor humor.

1055
01:00:49,893 --> 01:00:51,591
I'm Dr. Moses Buwie.

1056
01:00:51,592 --> 01:00:54,391
I'm the
gastroentorologist on call.

1057
01:00:54,392 --> 01:00:56,226
Let me check your
breathing here real quick.

1058
01:00:56,227 --> 01:00:59,327
If you could lean
forward for me.

1059
01:01:00,858 --> 01:01:03,359
Give me a deep breath.

1060
01:01:05,827 --> 01:01:08,027
Another one.

1061
01:01:10,193 --> 01:01:12,292
All right. If you could
lean back a little bit,

1062
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,626
just lie back.

1063
01:01:18,292 --> 01:01:21,858
Are you having any
abdominal pains whatsoever?

1064
01:01:21,859 --> 01:01:23,926
Not at the moment.

1065
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:26,692
Right, right. Good. ok.

1066
01:01:26,693 --> 01:01:28,226
You can sit up.

1067
01:01:30,626 --> 01:01:33,361
I had a moment to
go over your charts.

1068
01:01:37,792 --> 01:01:40,090
I do have a few concerns, ok?

1069
01:01:40,091 --> 01:01:41,658
We're gonna get you out of here

1070
01:01:41,659 --> 01:01:45,026
as soon as possible, though,
just sit tight. Right?

1071
01:01:49,827 --> 01:01:53,426
Good evening.

1072
01:01:53,427 --> 01:01:54,692
Hello?

1073
01:01:54,693 --> 01:01:58,225
Am I dying? You came to
read me my last rites?

1074
01:01:58,226 --> 01:02:02,126
No, I'm a minister and
I'm here to pray with you.

1075
01:02:02,127 --> 01:02:03,158
Me along with some
other ministers,

1076
01:02:03,159 --> 01:02:04,859
we visit patients
in the hospital,

1077
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,493
and we offer prayer
for those that want it.

1078
01:02:07,494 --> 01:02:09,225
'cause I thought...

1079
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:10,625
well, never mind.

1080
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:13,858
Well since you're here,
can I ask you a question?

1081
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:15,927
Hope I can answer it.

1082
01:02:15,928 --> 01:02:17,726
Why are people so sick nowadays?

1083
01:02:17,727 --> 01:02:20,460
All these different
diseases popping up.

1084
01:02:20,461 --> 01:02:22,125
Where's God in all of this?

1085
01:02:22,126 --> 01:02:23,993
Why does He allow it?

1086
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:27,293
That's a good question.

1087
01:02:29,527 --> 01:02:33,759
If you had a son, would
you allow him to be beat,

1088
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,026
and put to death for
something you caused?

1089
01:02:38,027 --> 01:02:39,092
No.

1090
01:02:39,093 --> 01:02:40,926
Good answer.

1091
01:02:40,927 --> 01:02:42,725
Well, it's Satan.

1092
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:45,493
The Bible says he is
the author of confusion.

1093
01:02:45,494 --> 01:02:47,992
That's the reason
for drug abuse,

1094
01:02:47,993 --> 01:02:50,692
depression, the list goes on.

1095
01:02:50,693 --> 01:02:53,294
But this God, He
came to give us life.

1096
01:02:53,295 --> 01:02:54,926
He came to give us life.

1097
01:02:54,927 --> 01:02:56,061
Really?

1098
01:02:56,062 --> 01:02:59,927
Yes. Jesus tells of
a story in the Bible

1099
01:02:59,928 --> 01:03:02,027
of a man who was born blind.

1100
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,827
And the disciples,
they wondered,

1101
01:03:03,828 --> 01:03:06,626
well, whose fault is it
that this man is born blind?

1102
01:03:06,627 --> 01:03:09,226
Is it his fault, or is it
the fault of his parents?

1103
01:03:09,227 --> 01:03:12,693
And Jesus said, neither
he or his parents' fault.

1104
01:03:12,694 --> 01:03:15,160
But that the will of
God may be made manifest

1105
01:03:15,161 --> 01:03:16,760
in his condition.

1106
01:03:16,761 --> 01:03:19,493
See, when Satan
comes in to attack us,

1107
01:03:19,494 --> 01:03:22,927
we can counterattack
with prayer and faith.

1108
01:03:22,928 --> 01:03:24,494
Those are our weapons.

1109
01:03:24,495 --> 01:03:26,159
And that's what Jesus used.

1110
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,027
And he got good results.

1111
01:03:28,028 --> 01:03:31,162
The man, well,
he was made whole.

1112
01:03:31,994 --> 01:03:33,960
So let's pray.

1113
01:03:33,961 --> 01:03:37,094
Let's pray. Can
I take your hand?

1114
01:03:37,694 --> 01:03:41,393
Dear Father, I thank You
for this precious child,

1115
01:03:41,394 --> 01:03:43,694
this daughter of Yours, God.

1116
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:45,861
You are omniscient,
You're omnipresent.

1117
01:03:45,862 --> 01:03:48,094
You know all and You're
here with us right now.

1118
01:03:48,095 --> 01:03:49,762
I don't know what
her condition is,

1119
01:03:49,763 --> 01:03:50,627
but You know.

1120
01:03:50,628 --> 01:03:53,528
And Father, I lift
her up before You.

1121
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:55,160
I ask You to give her peace,

1122
01:03:55,161 --> 01:03:56,693
I ask You to give her strength,

1123
01:03:56,694 --> 01:03:59,094
more important I ask
You to heal her body.

1124
01:03:59,095 --> 01:04:01,393
Touch her from
the top of her head

1125
01:04:01,394 --> 01:04:03,062
to the tips of her toes.

1126
01:04:03,063 --> 01:04:04,995
Make her well again.

1127
01:04:04,996 --> 01:04:06,228
Make her whole again.

1128
01:04:06,229 --> 01:04:08,962
Give her life, and
give her joy and peace.

1129
01:04:08,963 --> 01:04:12,627
This in Christ's
name we pray. Amen.

1130
01:04:12,628 --> 01:04:13,961
Amen.

1131
01:04:13,962 --> 01:04:15,661
Well, thank you.

1132
01:04:15,662 --> 01:04:18,561
Remember, we'll be
praying with you.

1133
01:04:18,562 --> 01:04:19,195
God bless you.

1134
01:04:19,196 --> 01:04:20,129
Thank you so much.

1135
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:21,393
You're more than welcome.

1136
01:04:21,394 --> 01:04:23,796
You're more than welcome.

1137
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:39,794
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?

1138
01:04:39,795 --> 01:04:43,829
No, come on in. I
was just praying.

1139
01:04:44,662 --> 01:04:47,927
You know, my foster
mother used to

1140
01:04:47,928 --> 01:04:50,196
pray for people in the hospital.

1141
01:04:50,197 --> 01:04:51,996
You never told me that.

1142
01:04:51,997 --> 01:04:54,562
I never even seen you pray.

1143
01:04:54,563 --> 01:04:56,161
Well, just because
you never see me pray

1144
01:04:56,162 --> 01:04:57,662
don't mean I don't.

1145
01:04:57,663 --> 01:05:00,228
What's the secret about praying?

1146
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:02,197
No secret, it's just...

1147
01:05:02,963 --> 01:05:04,695
I've never seen you
pray, so I didn't know

1148
01:05:04,696 --> 01:05:07,895
if you'd had a problem
with me praying.

1149
01:05:07,896 --> 01:05:09,828
I didn't know that.

1150
01:05:09,829 --> 01:05:12,395
I used to pray all the
time with my grandmother.

1151
01:05:12,396 --> 01:05:17,762
But after she died, I didn't
wanna talk to God anymore.

1152
01:05:17,763 --> 01:05:20,462
You know my foster
mother used to say

1153
01:05:20,463 --> 01:05:23,662
that even when you stop
praying with your mouth,

1154
01:05:23,663 --> 01:05:26,130
He's still listening
to your heart.

1155
01:05:27,896 --> 01:05:28,995
Old wisdom.

1156
01:05:28,996 --> 01:05:29,828
Yeah.

1157
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:30,796
I wish I had met her.

1158
01:05:30,797 --> 01:05:34,364
Me too. You'd like her.
She's a lot like you.

1159
01:05:43,829 --> 01:05:45,130
Hello?

1160
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:45,895
Mrs. Owens.

1161
01:05:45,896 --> 01:05:46,963
Yes?

1162
01:05:46,964 --> 01:05:48,897
Hey, this is Dr.
Buwie, how are you?

1163
01:05:48,898 --> 01:05:50,030
I'm good, how are you?

1164
01:05:50,031 --> 01:05:52,097
Good, good.

1165
01:05:52,397 --> 01:05:54,195
Well, I don't normally do this,

1166
01:05:54,196 --> 01:05:56,696
but I found these
circumstances to be unique,

1167
01:05:56,697 --> 01:06:01,797
so the test that you took
when you first arrived

1168
01:06:01,798 --> 01:06:05,530
showed what our Doctor
believed was Crohns disease.

1169
01:06:05,531 --> 01:06:09,031
Yes, I was diagnosed
with it two years ago.

1170
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:11,662
After looking at these results,

1171
01:06:11,663 --> 01:06:14,096
I don't see any
evidence of inflammation

1172
01:06:14,097 --> 01:06:16,599
in your intestines whatsoever.

1173
01:06:17,198 --> 01:06:20,830
But I did find in another test

1174
01:06:20,831 --> 01:06:24,632
that you are almost
two months pregnant.

1175
01:06:26,464 --> 01:06:30,663
My God!

1176
01:06:30,664 --> 01:06:34,864
Yes.

1177
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:36,230
Well, congratulations, guys.

1178
01:06:36,231 --> 01:06:38,631
Thank you so much.

1179
01:06:38,898 --> 01:06:41,231
-Ok. Bye
-bye.

1180
01:06:41,997 --> 01:06:43,163
Bye.

1181
01:06:43,164 --> 01:06:46,131
My God! Baby!

1182
01:06:50,831 --> 01:06:52,764
Yes!

1183
01:06:54,964 --> 01:06:56,664
My God!

1184
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:16,030
Look, Phae, I know
you don't want me here,

1185
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:18,332
but it's about Mikayla.

1186
01:07:18,899 --> 01:07:20,230
So, her school called me today

1187
01:07:20,231 --> 01:07:22,731
and informed me that
she's missed four days

1188
01:07:22,732 --> 01:07:24,198
in the past two weeks.

1189
01:07:24,199 --> 01:07:26,696
Not to mention when I
get home from work today,

1190
01:07:26,697 --> 01:07:29,864
she's in the corridor
with several kids.

1191
01:07:29,865 --> 01:07:31,698
What's going on?

1192
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:33,765
Mikayla, go to your room.

1193
01:07:33,766 --> 01:07:36,831
Why? Are there any more
secrets I have to know about?

1194
01:07:36,832 --> 01:07:38,630
Like is Mr. Thomas my daddy?

1195
01:07:38,631 --> 01:07:40,464
Don't ever disrespect
your mother like that.

1196
01:07:40,465 --> 01:07:43,097
Do you understand
me? Now, apologize.

1197
01:07:43,098 --> 01:07:44,699
Girl?

1198
01:07:46,166 --> 01:07:48,300
I'm sorry, Ma.

1199
01:07:48,499 --> 01:07:50,463
Little girl,

1200
01:07:50,464 --> 01:07:51,963
I know I've only been your mama

1201
01:07:51,964 --> 01:07:53,098
for a couple weeks, but

1202
01:07:53,099 --> 01:07:54,964
I've been your aunty
your whole life.

1203
01:07:54,965 --> 01:07:56,231
You try that mess with me again,

1204
01:07:56,232 --> 01:07:58,365
and I promise you it'll
be the last word you speak.

1205
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:02,167
Do you understand
me? Go to your room.

1206
01:08:04,698 --> 01:08:06,632
-She's just acting
out. You know, she...

1207
01:08:06,633 --> 01:08:07,864
Listen, let's get
something straight.

1208
01:08:07,865 --> 01:08:10,699
I don't like you and I
don't want you in my house.

1209
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:11,765
So don't come over
here and try to play

1210
01:08:11,766 --> 01:08:14,264
that sister sister
crap with me, Tammy.

1211
01:08:14,265 --> 01:08:15,731
Look, I know what it's
like to lose a child,

1212
01:08:15,732 --> 01:08:18,897
so I understand the pain
you're having to revisit,

1213
01:08:18,898 --> 01:08:20,832
in addition to losing this one.

1214
01:08:20,833 --> 01:08:22,665
But Mikayla is my child.

1215
01:08:22,666 --> 01:08:24,798
I'm not going to
separate you from her,

1216
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,631
but as far as me and you?

1217
01:08:26,632 --> 01:08:27,898
I'm gonna have to work
on that forgiveness thing

1218
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:31,299
and I'm not ready, so
you can see yourself out.

1219
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:45,032
Girl, I guess she
thought I wasn't

1220
01:08:45,033 --> 01:08:46,700
gonna ever find out...

1221
01:08:46,701 --> 01:08:48,899
Phaedra! How are you doing?

1222
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,166
Hi, Kim!

1223
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:52,998
What a coincidence, I
just seen your sister.

1224
01:08:52,999 --> 01:08:54,265
Just seen Tammy.

1225
01:08:54,266 --> 01:08:56,601
Yeah, please don't let
my sister know where I am.

1226
01:08:57,232 --> 01:08:59,866
Why? What's going on?

1227
01:08:59,867 --> 01:09:01,766
Girl, Tammy has lost her mind.

1228
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:04,098
I don't wanna have
nothing to do with her,

1229
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:06,299
let alone talk about her.

1230
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,100
Well, that's your sister.

1231
01:09:08,101 --> 01:09:09,700
It couldn't be that bad.

1232
01:09:09,701 --> 01:09:10,833
Not that bad?

1233
01:09:10,834 --> 01:09:12,433
Has your sister ever told you

1234
01:09:12,434 --> 01:09:13,999
your baby died while
you were in a coma,

1235
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,232
paid you the settlement money
for the death of your child,

1236
01:09:17,233 --> 01:09:19,200
all the while raising
the child as her own

1237
01:09:19,201 --> 01:09:21,866
right in front of your nose?

1238
01:09:21,867 --> 01:09:24,701
Are you serious?

1239
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:30,299
I can't even begin to
understand how you feel.

1240
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:33,467
But let's focus on Tammy.

1241
01:09:33,468 --> 01:09:34,666
Have you sat down and thought

1242
01:09:34,667 --> 01:09:37,066
what made her go through
such drastic measures?

1243
01:09:37,067 --> 01:09:38,298
I don't give a...

1244
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:39,199
Excuse me, I don't
mean to disrespect you,

1245
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,633
I know you're a minister, Kim,

1246
01:09:40,634 --> 01:09:42,199
but I don't really
care what made

1247
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,200
Tammy do the things she did.

1248
01:09:45,201 --> 01:09:46,668
It's ridiculous.

1249
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:50,633
You know what?

1250
01:09:50,634 --> 01:09:53,599
There was a story in the
Bible that was similar to this.

1251
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:57,733
And what we have to do
is focus on the child.

1252
01:09:57,734 --> 01:10:00,998
Let's put our thoughts
and our anger aside,

1253
01:10:00,999 --> 01:10:03,233
and let's think about the child.

1254
01:10:03,234 --> 01:10:05,933
A real mother will
make the right decision.

1255
01:10:05,934 --> 01:10:07,835
Yeah, whatever.

1256
01:10:08,367 --> 01:10:12,133
You know what? God
gonna forgive you.

1257
01:10:12,134 --> 01:10:13,700
And you keep trusting Him.

1258
01:10:13,701 --> 01:10:16,799
Put all this mess
aside, and you trust God.

1259
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,699
And He's gonna forgive you,

1260
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:20,301
He will restore you
guys' relationship.

1261
01:10:20,302 --> 01:10:23,934
I believe it. All right?

1262
01:10:23,935 --> 01:10:25,835
Whatever, ok.

1263
01:10:26,667 --> 01:10:29,166
Well, I'm gonna leave you alone.

1264
01:10:29,167 --> 01:10:31,834
But you give me a call
if you need me, love.

1265
01:10:31,835 --> 01:10:32,766
Ok.

1266
01:10:32,767 --> 01:10:33,867
I'll be here for you.

1267
01:10:33,868 --> 01:10:35,834
Thanks, honey. Appreciate you.

1268
01:10:35,835 --> 01:10:37,133
Good seeing you.

1269
01:10:37,134 --> 01:10:39,001
If you need me, just
give me a call, ok, love?

1270
01:10:39,002 --> 01:10:40,668
All right.

1271
01:10:41,168 --> 01:10:43,301
Bye.

1272
01:10:56,735 --> 01:10:59,002
Phaedra, I know...

1273
01:10:59,235 --> 01:11:00,666
I miss you, Phae.

1274
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:02,866
I know you don't
wanna talk to me sis,

1275
01:11:02,867 --> 01:11:05,400
but please call me back, please.

1276
01:11:05,401 --> 01:11:07,336
I'm going crazy, and I...

1277
01:11:08,335 --> 01:11:10,335
I just need to talk to you.

1278
01:11:10,802 --> 01:11:13,970
I love you. Bye.

1279
01:11:33,801 --> 01:11:34,968
Hey, Phae.

1280
01:11:34,969 --> 01:11:37,135
Hey, Tammy.

1281
01:11:37,802 --> 01:11:39,734
I'm not trying to waste
any of your time or nothing.

1282
01:11:39,735 --> 01:11:41,171
I just...

1283
01:11:41,735 --> 01:11:44,169
I just wanna say I'm
sorry for lying to you

1284
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:45,604
and...

1285
01:11:45,903 --> 01:11:48,169
betraying you like...

1286
01:11:48,835 --> 01:11:50,002
I'm sorry.

1287
01:11:50,003 --> 01:11:52,002
I just miss my sister.

1288
01:11:52,003 --> 01:11:53,568
Look, Tammy, I...

1289
01:11:53,569 --> 01:11:58,035
I know you always drilling
Jesus, Jesus to me, and

1290
01:11:58,036 --> 01:12:00,500
you know, I'm not
quite there, but

1291
01:12:00,501 --> 01:12:03,034
I am willing to give this whole

1292
01:12:03,035 --> 01:12:04,836
forgiveness thing a try, 'cause

1293
01:12:04,837 --> 01:12:08,301
I can't raise Mikayla
without you, I can't.

1294
01:12:08,302 --> 01:12:09,902
I can't do life without you.

1295
01:12:09,903 --> 01:12:11,935
You're all I got.

1296
01:12:11,936 --> 01:12:13,936
I'm sorry.

1297
01:12:20,137 --> 01:12:22,336
I'm so sorry.

1298
01:12:24,835 --> 01:12:25,868
I love you.

1299
01:12:25,869 --> 01:12:27,638
I love you too.

1300
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:13,371
What you think?

1301
01:13:14,336 --> 01:13:17,704
He burns food. He
does not cook it.

1302
01:13:20,137 --> 01:13:22,271
It's well done.

1303
01:13:22,969 --> 01:13:25,168
No that, my friend, is burnt.

1304
01:13:25,169 --> 01:13:26,605
It...

1305
01:13:27,204 --> 01:13:30,136
No, eat it, it's fine
man, that ain't burnt.

1306
01:13:30,137 --> 01:13:31,836
No, put it down.

1307
01:13:31,837 --> 01:13:32,903
No, no, no, no.

1308
01:13:32,904 --> 01:13:35,138
What you think?

1309
01:13:35,836 --> 01:13:39,371
Burnt.

1310
01:14:00,704 --> 01:14:01,537
Wasn't that fun?

1311
01:14:01,538 --> 01:14:02,070
It was.

1312
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:03,103
That food was so good.

1313
01:14:03,104 --> 01:14:04,238
Glad you invited me.

1314
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:06,804
Tammy, you do not
have to do that.

1315
01:14:06,805 --> 01:14:08,770
-No problem.
-Thanks so much for coming.

1316
01:14:08,771 --> 01:14:09,703
Thank you for having me.

1317
01:14:09,704 --> 01:14:11,504
Let me introduce you
to my sister Phaedra.

1318
01:14:11,505 --> 01:14:13,237
-Hi.
-We met briefly.

1319
01:14:13,904 --> 01:14:15,038
Thank you so much for coming.

1320
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:16,703
Tammy told me so much about you.

1321
01:14:16,704 --> 01:14:17,371
Tammy?

1322
01:14:17,372 --> 01:14:18,672
It wasn't bad, I promise.

1323
01:14:18,673 --> 01:14:20,171
No, it wasn't
anything bad, trust me.

1324
01:14:20,172 --> 01:14:21,103
Good.

1325
01:14:21,104 --> 01:14:22,138
When are you due?

1326
01:14:22,139 --> 01:14:23,337
Any day now.

1327
01:14:23,338 --> 01:14:24,938
What are you having?

1328
01:14:24,939 --> 01:14:27,138
A boy, but my husband doesn't
know anything about it.

1329
01:14:27,139 --> 01:14:28,337
What? How did you
keep that a secret?

1330
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:29,570
What are you naming him?

1331
01:14:29,571 --> 01:14:31,537
Ian Christopher. Ian
means gift of God.

1332
01:14:31,538 --> 01:14:33,903
-So great!
-Thank you.

1333
01:14:33,904 --> 01:14:35,704
So happy for you, I really am.

1334
01:14:35,705 --> 01:14:37,870
You're just
glowing, and floating

1335
01:14:37,871 --> 01:14:39,238
on ice and water, girl,

1336
01:14:39,239 --> 01:14:41,338
I want what you got.

1337
01:14:41,339 --> 01:14:43,938
I am. I can't
imagine a better life

1338
01:14:43,939 --> 01:14:45,338
than the one I have now.

1339
01:14:45,339 --> 01:14:47,371
I wish I could
imagine that life.

1340
01:14:47,372 --> 01:14:48,637
It ain't my time yet.

1341
01:14:48,638 --> 01:14:50,138
Malaina, your house
is so beautiful.

1342
01:14:50,139 --> 01:14:51,706
It's too big.

1343
01:14:52,339 --> 01:14:55,971
Too big. Not for long,
Jesus, with these kids.

1344
01:14:55,972 --> 01:14:56,938
She just popping out one, two,

1345
01:14:56,939 --> 01:14:58,072
and three coming, five.

1346
01:14:58,073 --> 01:15:00,472
We are gonna take
it slow this time.

1347
01:15:00,473 --> 01:15:03,273
I don't even know what
to do with this one.

1348
01:15:03,473 --> 01:15:04,271
I know someone that

1349
01:15:04,272 --> 01:15:05,404
can help. -Who?

1350
01:15:05,405 --> 01:15:06,771
She did an amazing
job with hers.

1351
01:15:06,772 --> 01:15:09,404
We did an amazing job,
I didn't do it by myself.

1352
01:15:09,405 --> 01:15:12,973
Tammy, you know, I
never did thank you.

1353
01:15:12,974 --> 01:15:16,104
It's Ok. I never did say
thank you for forgiving me.

1354
01:15:16,105 --> 01:15:17,338
So, thank you for that.

1355
01:15:17,339 --> 01:15:18,471
I'm really happy
to have you back.

1356
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:19,770
You know, I couldn't stay mad.

1357
01:15:19,771 --> 01:15:21,071
-I know, I'm too awesome.
-I love you.

1358
01:15:21,072 --> 01:15:22,404
I love you too, sis.

1359
01:15:22,405 --> 01:15:23,905
-What's wrong?
-Are you ok? What's wrong?

1360
01:15:23,906 --> 01:15:27,305
My water just broke!

1361
01:15:27,306 --> 01:15:28,838
I think it did, too.

1362
01:15:28,839 --> 01:15:29,404
Chris!

1363
01:15:29,405 --> 01:15:32,108
God, it's nasty.
