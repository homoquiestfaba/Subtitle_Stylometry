1
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:14,292
I did it, Jack. I did it.

2
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,962
And you know what?
It got me hot.

3
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,335
No, I'm not kidding.

4
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:26,038
<i>You should have seen the look</i>
<i>on Carl's face when I buried</i>
<i>that ax in his chest. </i>

5
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:31,675
Ohh! Killing him was almost
better than sex.

6
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,912
I said almost, didn't I?

7
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,855
Ohhh! We are going
to have so much fun...

8
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:41,985
spending all of his money,
aren't we, baby?

9
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,895
Oooh! Just thinking
about it gets me all...

10
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:49,696
hot and squishy.

11
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,169
You mean right now?

12
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:56,140
<i>He's in the basement</i>
<i>cooling off. </i>

13
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,934
What took you so long?

14
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,630
Jesus, Jack, what kind
of cologne...

15
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,045
Cut!

16
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,104
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!

17
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,276
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

18
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,286
You call that "hack-ting"?

19
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,482
Well, yes,
I do call it acting.

20
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:49,153
Well, let me tell you something.
You're no "Gorey" Cooper.

21
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,754
<i>You ain't even</i>
<i>a Robert "Deadford. "</i>

22
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:55,528
<i>Another take like that</i>
<i>and it'll be back</i>
<i>to bit parts for you. </i>

23
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,230
And I won't say what bits
I'm talking about.

24
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,671
<i>Huh! All right,</i>
<i>everybody. Reset!</i>

25
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,504
Reset, guys.

26
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,340
Director?

27
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,779
Where the hell did
they dig this guy up?

28
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:13,808
I give and I give and I...
Oh!

29
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:17,652
Hello, kiddies.
So glad you could join me.

30
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:22,491
Your old pal the Crypt Keeper
has gone Hollywood in a big way.

31
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,462
Care to see what I've been
working on?

32
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:30,063
So if you're ready, creeps,
fasten your drool cups...

33
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,696
and hold on to
your vomit bags.

34
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,468
We're going to the movies!

35
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:39,841
Frights! Camera!
Action!

36
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,319
<i>I call this one... </i>

37
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,585
Come on!

38
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,124
Son of a bitch!

39
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,464
Come on,
you son of a bitch!

40
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,501
Oh, shit!

41
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,743
Damn!

42
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,295
What ya doin', mister?

43
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:54,925
- Are you stealing
my daddy's car?
- Stealin'?

44
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:59,062
No, I was testing the lock.
Seems to be working just fine.

45
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,299
You want a quarter?

46
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:05,470
How about a shiny new quarter?
You want one?

47
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,309
Dad, there's a guy outside
stealing your car!

48
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,316
<i>Hey, Dad, hurry up. </i>
<i>Get out here!</i>

49
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,587
Homer, go!
He's gone.

50
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:32,666
Boy, listen
to that thunder.

51
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,571
God's doing some
serious thinking tonight.

52
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,072
I'll bet he's saying,

53
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,641
"On second thought,
maybe I should have given
it all to the monkeys. "

54
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,621
- Maybe it's not to late.
- I always hate drinking alone.
You want a taste?

55
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,022
Sure.

56
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,600
To the monkeys.

57
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,538
It ain't very subtle,
but it does the trick.

58
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,204
You wouldn't happen to know
of a place where I could
bed down, would you?

59
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,372
Well, it just
so happens, I do.

60
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,006
<i>That's two cars, Sheriff?</i>
That's right, Mavis.

61
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,713
One of 'em's got Maryland
plates, and the other one's
from New Jersey.

62
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,721
Ten-four.
Ten-four.

63
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,025
You were right, Sheriff.

64
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:31,792
Them sons of bitches must have
been doing well over a hundred.

65
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,731
Well, Bob, it's too late
to give them a ticket.

66
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,292
But, if it'll make you
feel any better, you can
shoot their ashes.

67
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,373
What the...

68
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,466
<i>Holy shit!</i>

69
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,909
Hey, mister,
get away from there.

70
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,142
Where the hell you
come from?
This is my car.

71
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,014
Was my car.
Did you see him?

72
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,815
Walking into town,
the guy I was chasing?

73
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,516
Air bags, gotta love 'em.
Did you see him?

74
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,755
- We didn't see anybody.
- Now wait a minute.

75
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,855
Are you telling me
that guy over there
walked out of here too?

76
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:10,231
Where you goin'? You got
a few questions to answer.

77
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,865
Look, Officers, the man
I'm chasing is dangerous.

78
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,340
<i>If he's in your town,</i>
<i>you got a problem. </i>

79
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,538
We stand here arguing
about a traffic accident...
Do you mind?

80
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:24,276
<i>Something awful's about</i>
<i>to go down... over there. </i>

81
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,649
Is that where we're going?
It looks like a church.

82
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,450
That's it.
Used to be a church.

83
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,457
Ain't a church no more.

84
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,052
They decommissioned it
in the '50s, due to lack
of interest.

85
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,266
Just the place
I've been looking for.

86
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,204
Gangway, I'm bringing
in business.

87
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,906
What kind of business?

88
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,379
I think he's looking for
a room of his own, Cordelia.

89
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,974
<i>You been drinking,</i>
<i>Uncle Willy?</i>

90
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,986
- I'm clean as a whistle, Irene.
- How long you wanting the room?

91
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,282
I don't know.
One night, maybe two.
Depends.

92
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,319
I never rent short-term,
and I don't rent to strangers.

93
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,497
But I can make exceptions.

94
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,676
<i>Okay. </i>

95
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,941
Enjoy your stay,
Mr...

96
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,984
Mr. Smith.

97
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,414
Jeryline! Jeryline!

98
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,084
Jeryline, I mean now!

99
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,719
I'm trying
to clean your stove.

100
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:46,128
How do you expect me
to get my work done
if you keep bothering me?

101
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:50,498
You've been working so hard
with them clean rubber gloves?

102
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,662
Show Mr. Smith
up to number five.

103
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,341
And then fix him some dinner.

104
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,716
And after that, I got
a few more jobs for you.

105
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,348
<i>This time I'm gonna</i>
<i>watch you. </i>

106
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:15,359
<i>I want it right</i>
<i>the first time, and that's</i>
<i>all there is to it. </i>

107
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,554
<i>It's my way</i>
<i>or the highway. </i>

108
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,723
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

109
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,177
What do I need to tell you?

110
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,511
What am I looking at?
Which way is town?

111
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,383
Town is that way,
and you're looking at nothing.

112
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:45,719
But I'm sure you didn't
come here for a view.
But here's your key.

113
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,995
And the concierge will bring up
your bags momentarily.

114
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,692
<i>I don't see how they could</i>
<i>fire you, Wally. </i>

115
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,737
<i>That's what</i>
<i>I told them. </i>

116
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,432
Cordelia, I don't know what
happened to all that mail.

117
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,442
It just disappeared,
but they won't believe me.

118
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,536
God! It's so humiliating.
Do you know what he did?

119
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,605
Uh-uh.
Postmaster comes in...

120
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,083
and he rips my name tag
right off my shirt.

121
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,120
Right in front
of everybody.

122
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,554
And like that's not bad enough,
he took my Mr. Zippy patch.

123
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:22,025
You should have told your
damn boss to go screw himself.

124
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,427
Stupid post office.
Ain't the only job in town.

125
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,931
The hell it ain't.
If you had any sense, Wally,

126
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,901
you'd crawl back to him
and beg for the job.

127
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,098
Yeah, well,
I already tried that.

128
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,903
He said no.

129
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,910
Oh, poor Wally.

130
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,573
Where is that girl?
Jeryline!

131
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,914
- What is it?
- Are my sheets done yet?

132
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,890
They're downstairs.
And I couldn't get all those
stains out, either.

133
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,949
Damn guacamole.

134
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,655
Will you put them
on my bed for me?

135
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,429
- Why can't you do it yourself?
You know I'm busy.
- Get her sheets, will you?

136
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:06,335
No, I just started that stove.
I can't do everything at once.

137
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,737
I'll get them for you,
Cordelia.

138
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,139
Good. Damn.

139
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,576
That's very sweet of you,
Wally.

140
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,843
Put them on your bed?
Thanks.

141
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,654
Oh, poor guy.

142
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,190
Maybe I should give him
a freebie.

143
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,352
Just what he needs,
someone else screwing him.

144
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:34,091
To be perfectly honest, I wasn't
watching the speedometer.

145
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,693
- Exactly why
were you chasing him?
- He's a thief.

146
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:42,207
What the hell did he steal
that had you going over
100 miles an hour?

147
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,810
Must have been
pretty valuable.

148
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,371
It is.

149
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,145
<i>Sheriff?</i>
Yeah, Mavis, go ahead.

150
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,812
<i>We just got a call from Homer</i>
<i>over at the café. </i>

151
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,618
<i>He says somebody tried</i>
<i>to steal his car. </i>

152
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,859
Okay, we're on it.

153
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,245
- You want some?
- Hell, no.

154
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:30,345
I was just thinking how much
better that stuff looked
when it was roadkill.

155
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,890
Why don't you shut up?
You eat it.

156
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,483
- She loves me.
- You hurry up and finish and...

157
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,560
I'll take care of dessert.

158
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,693
Ah, don't worry.

159
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,639
Good Cleo knows better
than to eat that slop.

160
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,337
Goddamn it! Get that
pussy off the table.

161
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,311
I meant the cat.

162
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,784
Cleo!
Didn't I tell you
to put him out?

163
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,549
I did. I don't know
how she got back in.

164
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:07,080
<i>You finish cleaning</i>
<i>the stove, or you too busy</i>
<i>shooting the breeze?</i>

165
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,322
For Christ's sake, I'll finish
cleaning it tomorrow.

166
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,261
I want it clean tonight.

167
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,893
<i>Remind me of that program</i>
<i>you're on. It's called</i>
<i>"work release", ain't it?</i>

168
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:20,097
<i>I swear that girl ain't got</i>
<i>no goddamn gratitude. </i>

169
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:23,107
If I hadn't made a place
for her, she'd be behind bars
or dead.

170
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,008
- Lucky kid.
- Mmm.

171
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,714
You expecting somebody,
Mr. Smith?

172
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,320
Evenin', motel people.

173
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,437
<i> You kept</i>
<i>me waiting, Roach. </i>
<i>Ohh. </i>

174
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:59,739
<i>I'll tell you the reason I'm late. </i>
<i>Somebody tried to steal Homer's car. </i>

175
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,178
You're kiddin'?
That old hunk of junk?
Yeah.

176
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,272
<i>Right out of the diner</i>
<i>parking lot. </i>

177
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:08,285
Sheriff and Deputy Dipshit
showed up too.

178
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:11,845
Damn, you look sweet.
Thank you, honey.

179
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,286
<i>You know, I've been looking</i>
<i>forward to this all week. </i>

180
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:21,355
That makes two of us.
Hey, what are those
panties you got on there?

181
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,424
I got the cherry flavor.

182
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,801
Are those edible panties?

183
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:31,070
You know I want pieces
of panty in my salad later.

184
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,976
<i>Oh, Roach,</i>
<i>you're so dirty!</i>

185
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,943
Why don't you set the basket
by the steps, Wally.

186
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,350
She's gonna be needing
clean sheets soon enough.

187
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,930
Your boy did the right thing.
You should be...

188
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,300
That about covers it.
We'll let you know
if we hear anything.

189
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,430
<i>Sheriff, you there?</i>

190
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,509
Go ahead, Mavis.

191
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:09,843
<i>I just got a call from Irene</i>
<i>at the mission about that fellow</i>
<i>you're looking for. </i>

192
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:13,510
<i>Let's go, Sheriff. </i>
<i>Get in. </i>

193
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,972
He's really holding on tonight,
isn't he?

194
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,010
Okay.

195
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,773
So what were you in for?

196
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,009
I'm not passing judgment.

197
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,711
Stealin'. 'Kay?

198
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,957
- Good evening, Irene.
Where is he?
- <i>That's him, in the dining room. </i>

199
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:06,369
Excuse me, mister. We'd like
to have a word with you about
the fender bender on the highway.

200
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:10,204
Sheriff, you better
watch it. He's armed.

201
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,078
Told you.

202
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,138
- Drop the guns,
or I'll kill her.
- Don't!

203
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,708
- I said, drop your goddamn guns.
- He won't do it.

204
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:25,587
- The hell I won't.
- I know this man,
and he will not do it.

205
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,921
<i>Drop the knife. </i>
<i>Drop the goddamn knife!</i>

206
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,052
Her blood's on your head,
asshole.

207
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,776
Spread 'em!

208
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,752
<i>Well, well, well. </i>
<i>Mr. Brayker. </i>

209
00:20:56,822 --> 00:21:00,155
- Pleased to make
your acquaintance.
- You lyin' son of a bitch.

210
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:03,524
<i>Said his name was Smith. </i>

211
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,529
Call it in, Bob.

212
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,367
I believe you'll find what
I'm looking for in there.

213
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,131
What's he got
to do with this?

214
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:19,541
- I'm... I work
for a collection agency.
- It's empty.

215
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,409
Really.
That can't be.

216
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,541
Well, I guess that means
it's somewhere in the house.

217
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,313
- Keep him away from me!
- Shut up!

218
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,848
Where is it?
I don't know what you're
talking about.

219
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:38,828
Maybe it's up in his room.
What you guys looking for?

220
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:42,355
- What the hell are we
looking for anyway?
- A piece of antiquity.

221
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,164
A relic...
in the shape of a key.

222
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:48,138
- Bob!
- Yeah?

223
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:51,073
<i>Search his room. </i>
It's number five.

224
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:23,468
<i>Come on, give it to me. </i>
<i>Come on. </i>

225
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:27,911
<i>Give it to me. </i>
<i>Come on. Ahh!</i>

226
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,072
Come on.
Crank me up.

227
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,778
Come on. Ahh!
God!
Is that good?

228
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,481
- Freeze!
- Ohh!

229
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,524
Jesus Christ, Bob,
you son of a bitch!

230
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:42,389
<i>Turn it off!</i>
<i>Turn it off!</i>
I'm sorry.

231
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,952
Oh! My nipples are smoking!

232
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,022
Get your clothes on.
Now!

233
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,536
<i>Good work, Mavis. </i>
Looky, looky.

234
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,608
<i>I didn't find anything</i>
<i>in the perp's room,</i>

235
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:01,305
but I sure found something
in the room down the hall.

236
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,178
Thanks, Mavis.

237
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:07,412
Sorry to drag you down here,
but we'll sort this thing out...

238
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,954
and then you can get back
to your business.

239
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,718
I am assuming it was
personal business, Cordelia.

240
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,726
Actually, Sheriff,

241
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,558
it was kind of like
a tune up and lube job.

242
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,894
Shut up, Bob!
I don't want
to hear about it.

243
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,662
You know how it is when you
get your car...
I don't want to hear it.

244
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,669
Shut up, Bob.

245
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,797
This Brayker fella's
getting more interesting.

246
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:33,174
<i>According to the computer,</i>
<i>Frank Brayker died over</i>
<i>five years ago. </i>

247
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,376
Who the hell are you?

248
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,385
What's your name?

249
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:48,022
Maybe if you cool your heels
in a jail cell, you'll be
a little more chatty.

250
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,085
Come on, Bob.
Help me get him to the car.

251
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,621
I'd appreciate getting back
what he stole from me.

252
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,690
<i>That way I can</i>
<i>get on my way,</i>

253
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,965
and you can give this lowlife
what he deserves.

254
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,802
Why don't you tell us
where you put it?

255
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:06,173
<i>You make it easy for me,</i>
<i>I'll make it easy for you. </i>

256
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,304
- Mind you, you're off
to a pretty bad start.
- I know where it is!

257
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:13,875
<i>It just occurred to me. </i>
<i>I watched him stash it</i>
<i>and didn't even know it. </i>

258
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,477
Willy, no!
Relax!

259
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,489
I'm sorry, mister.

260
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:37,636
I'd like you
to put it inside.

261
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:41,873
Look what he's done.
He's put somethin' awful inside.

262
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:45,144
<i>Would you mind dumping that out</i>
<i>before you place it inside?</i>

263
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,844
Sure.

264
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,250
No, don't do it.
He's not what he says he is.

265
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,881
He's just...
Just pop that lid.

266
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:55,085
I'll take that, Willy.

267
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,324
<i>Bob, escort Mr. Brayker,</i>
<i>or whatever his name is,</i>
<i>out to the car. </i>

268
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:05,233
Sheriff, I am much obliged
for your assistance
in apprehending...

269
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:08,704
Don't bother.
You're coming with us.

270
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,640
See, both those cars
were stolen.

271
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,009
We're going down to the station
and we're going to sort
this shit out.

272
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,382
Sheriff, you're making
a big mistake.

273
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,011
It won't be for the first time.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

274
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,885
The man said,
if you knew who I was...

275
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:27,481
We'll find out soon enough.

276
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,187
Why wait?

277
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,434
<i>Give me the keys!</i>

278
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,170
Give me the goddamn keys!

279
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,642
<i>Ah, come on!</i>
<i>Get off me!</i>

280
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,978
Ahhh!

281
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,248
Shit!

282
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,751
Heads up!

283
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:14,100
Ahhh!

284
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:23,009
<i>Humans! You're not worth</i>
<i>the flesh you're printed on!</i>

285
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:27,049
Fuck this cowboy shit!

286
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:30,679
You fuckin', hodunk Podunk,
well, then, motherfuckers!

287
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,248
All you had to do was give me
the goddamn key!

288
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,860
<i>Then we could get on</i>
<i>with our lives. </i>

289
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,421
All right, this property...

290
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:45,230
is hereby... condemned.

291
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,298
<i>Shit!</i>

292
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,400
What is that?

293
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,678
Oh, my God!
Shit!

294
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,188
Ahhh!

295
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,276
Oh, great.
What the hell happened
with the lights?

296
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,973
They're gone.

297
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,884
Everybody, back!

298
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,977
Where do you suppose
they went?

299
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,528
What's that smell?

300
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,791
Aaaaah!

301
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,071
Ahhh!

302
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,017
<i>Let's get out of here!</i>

303
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,895
<i>There's more of them!</i>

304
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,959
No, shoot 'em.

305
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:39,805
<i>Go out the back door. </i>
<i>Come on. Hurry up. </i>
<i>Hurry up. </i>

306
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,573
Oh, that is disgusting.

307
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,583
What the hell is that shit?

308
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,585
Shit!

309
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,315
I don't see them.
Do you see them?
No.

310
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,055
<i>Where the fuck did they go?</i>

311
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,164
Cordelia, stay away
from the door!

312
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:37,599
You see what I mean?
We can make it to my truck.
No, I don't think so.

313
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:42,197
Listen! You can stay here
and die if you want to.
I sure as shit ain't.

314
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,741
<i>Roach, be smart for once. </i>
Cordelia!

315
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:51,041
Roach, wait.
Just come on, would ya?

316
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:54,107
Ahhhh!

317
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,849
Cordelia, I'm coming!

318
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,628
I'm sorry.

319
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,394
Give me that gun!

320
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,129
Hey, fuck-face!

321
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,303
Get the eyes!
Get the eyes!

322
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:30,751
Oh, Wally.
Wally. Oh, God.

323
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,132
Need a hand?

324
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,495
Give me the key, Brayker.
For cryin' out loud!

325
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:49,766
Wally? Wally,
please don't die.

326
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,777
Wally?

327
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:59,342
Oh!

328
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,818
<i>Cordelia!</i>

329
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:12,655
<i>Brayker, what the hell</i>
<i>are those things?</i>
<i>Demons or something?</i>

330
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,927
Worse.
Demons. That's sweet.
That's just fuckin' sweet!

331
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,833
And they want to kill us
because of you?

332
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,428
Who's going to protect us?
You?

333
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:25,465
Deputy Bob?
Or the headless horsemen?
We'll be all right.

334
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:29,843
Just stay inside and stay
together. We just have
to make it through the night.

335
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,973
And that stuff's
gonna keep them out?

336
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,518
There are only two things
we can use against them.

337
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:36,519
- The blood in this key.
- It's blood?

338
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:40,990
And anything
that destroys their eyes.
Frees their tortured souls.

339
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,584
- This is crazy!
- Deal with it!

340
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:47,324
You deal with it.
They got no quarrel with us.

341
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:51,391
They just want you
and that thing you're carrying.

342
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,836
I say we give it to them.
I say they'll
kill you anyway.

343
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:58,171
<i>Or possess you. Or use you</i>
<i>to get to the rest of us. </i>

344
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,710
Like it or not,
we stick together.

345
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:05,078
- My cat's outside.
I gotta get my cat.
- You go out, you stay out.

346
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,516
Is that so?
What are you gonna do?

347
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,680
<i>Shoot us?</i>
Right in the eyes.

348
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,484
Stay down here.

349
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,892
I'm going to seal
the upstairs.

350
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,759
- Damn it!
- What are you doing up here?

351
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,798
I thought I told you
to stay downstairs.

352
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,867
Damn!

353
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,302
I thought you might
need help.

354
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:18,207
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about your cat.

355
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:22,616
And before, with the knife,
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

356
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:32,790
I knew you weren't.
I just had a feeling
about you.

357
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,768
Can I ask you something?

358
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,531
Who are you?
Really.

359
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,143
I'm just an old man...

360
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:51,576
running out of time.

361
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,980
Well, well, well.
Isn't this sweet?

362
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:04,585
Soiled dove and her
square-jawed postal clerk.

363
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:08,257
- You're a bastard.
- I ain't the one
who tried to kill you.

364
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,766
Shithead, you left me
out there.

365
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,702
Who in the hell told you
to follow me?

366
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,238
You're absolutely right.
Nobody.

367
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,902
Now I know
who my friends are.

368
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,882
Whores ain't got no friends.

369
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:29,919
<i>That's all the doors</i>
<i>and window sealed. </i>

370
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:34,720
Any other ways in or out
of this place?
Aside from doors and windows?

371
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,862
Got some place you
want us to put him?

372
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,805
Jeryline, let's go
make some coffee.

373
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,282
Looks like we're in
for a long night.

374
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,891
Where did you
get that from?
It was my husband's.

375
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:13,328
Cleo! Hi, baby.

376
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:17,231
You let the cat in.
She just appeared.

377
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,235
Brayker, what are you doing?

378
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,794
Animals aren't immune.
They can be possessed.

379
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,841
Give me the cat! Shit!

380
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,270
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>
The cat. The cat.

381
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:34,444
Brayker, my cat is not possessed
by some demon from hell.

382
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,586
We'll see.

383
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,589
Listen, I got
to talk to you.
What?

384
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,854
I got nothing to say.
I just gotta talk to you
for a second.

385
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,693
I don't want to talk. Why don't
you bother somebody else?
Just for a second.

386
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,927
You want to talk?
Let's talk about how you
abandoned Cordelia.

387
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,902
How you left her to die.
Huh?

388
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,269
I hope you're ashamed
of yourself.
Not particularly, no.

389
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,639
Everybody's got
to look out their selves.

390
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,771
- I'm for getting out of here.
- No one's going anywhere
till Mr. Brayker says so.

391
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,339
Hey, fuck him!
This is his fight.

392
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,545
<i>You may want to die in</i>
<i>this motel, but I don't. </i>

393
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:14,580
I want to get that key,
and I want to give it
to those things out there.

394
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:17,856
Hey, Roach.
Haven't you caused
just about enough trouble?

395
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:21,830
Excuse me. I'm trying
to have a conversation
with my friend, Wally.

396
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:25,733
He's not your friend.
Assholes don't have friends.

397
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,673
Excuse us.

398
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,437
Can I talk to you
for a second, please?

399
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:40,781
Jesus, Roach!

400
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:44,912
So... you got yourself
a new boyfriend.

401
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,923
You get in my way
and I'll kill you.

402
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,585
Keep it in your pants
for a change.

403
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,685
I'm warning you, bitch.

404
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:54,731
I'm not afraid of you.
No?

405
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:00,032
You better be afraid
of me.

406
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:13,178
<i>Come here, girl. </i>
<i>Come on. </i>

407
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,886
<i>Cleo, come on. </i>

408
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,961
Cleo?
Come to mommy.

409
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,759
<i>Come on. </i>
<i>Come here, girl. </i>

410
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:31,324
Come here, Cleo.
Come on.

411
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:38,730
<i>I got you, girl. </i>
<i>Come on, Brayker. </i>

412
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:44,813
See, I told you.
Hey, look...
where she came from.

413
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,388
Breeze.

414
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:27,388
<i></i>
<i>Poor, Cordelia. </i>

415
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:32,555
<i>Seems downright criminal</i>
<i>to treat a pretty girl</i>
<i>that way. </i>

416
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,088
<i>Did I say pretty?</i>
<i>I meant beautiful. </i>

417
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:40,297
<i>'Cause you are. </i>
<i>You are beautiful,</i>
<i>Cordelia. </i>

418
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:43,033
<i>Inside and out. </i>

419
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:46,270
<i>Maybe nobody here</i>
<i>can see it,</i>
<i>but I sure can. </i>

420
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,045
<i>I understand you. </i>

421
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,378
<i>I know what you want. </i>

422
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,317
<i>I know what you need. </i>

423
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,718
<i>Guys like Roach,</i>
<i>they think... </i>

424
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:01,155
<i>just because they're paying</i>
<i>for it that they can</i>
<i>treat you like shit. </i>

425
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,955
If they spend the same money
on dinner and a movie,

426
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:07,259
they can call you "girlfriend"
instead of "whore. "

427
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:10,061
<i>Whore, what a horrible word</i>
<i>that is... </i>

428
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:14,537
to use on someone
who's really just a sad girl
who's looking for love.

429
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:20,868
<i>Tender, warm,</i>
<i>unconditional love. </i>

430
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:26,547
I can give you that love,
as much as you can take.

431
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:44,925
All you have to do
is let me in.

432
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,436
<i>Let me in. </i>

433
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,531
<i>Let me in. </i>

434
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,974
<i>Let me in. </i>

435
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,773
<i>Let me in. </i>

436
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:59,181
Cordelia?

437
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,822
<i>Cordelia?</i>

438
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,521
Cordelia?
You okay?

439
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,856
- Hello, Wally.
- Hello, Cordelia.

440
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:21,367
I realized something awful
about myself tonight, Wally.

441
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:24,930
My whole life, I've avoided
the guys who really loved me.

442
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,605
Like you.

443
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:35,611
You really love me,
don't you, Wally?

444
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:39,486
Yes, Cordelia,
I really love you.

445
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,159
I've always loved you.

446
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,561
From the very first time
I delivered your mail.

447
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,702
Well, don't just do it
with your eyes, Wally.

448
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,909
It's some kind of tunnel.
It's a mine shaft.

449
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,916
Not surprising.
The whole area's
riddled with them.

450
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:09,111
This means this
is a way out.

451
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:13,555
We can get to town
before those things
find out we're gone.

452
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:16,559
No.

453
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:19,391
No, it's too risky.

454
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,988
What?
Now, listen. What
the hell are you saying?

455
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,591
Trust me.
You're safer in this house.

456
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:30,499
Shit!

457
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:32,508
What was that?

458
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:37,042
What's going on?

459
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:41,006
Oh, God!
<i>What's in there?</i>

460
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,647
- Cordelia?
- Ahhhh!

461
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,065
Oh, man!

462
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:02,736
<i>Shoot it, damn it!</i>
- I can't! I can't!

463
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,740
Shoot 'em both!

464
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,625
Stop it, stop it!

465
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:30,089
Ahhh!

466
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,336
Irene!

467
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,230
Ahhhh!

468
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,546
Ahhhh!

469
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:52,254
Ohh!

470
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:57,193
Go ahead.

471
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,255
Give it to me!

472
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:05,529
Shit!
It's still bleeding.
Here.

473
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:10,130
We've got to get her outta here.
She'll bleed to death.

474
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,437
We've got to take
our chances in the mines.

475
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:16,809
The spur that runs under here
comes to a head in a mile.

476
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,644
- I say we do it.
- Fuck, yeah.

477
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,151
What makes you think
they haven't found the mines?

478
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:26,553
<i>Has everybody fuckin' had it</i>
<i>with you tellin' us what to do?</i>

479
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:29,148
<i>If we want to go out to the</i>
<i>mines, we're going out that way. </i>

480
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,217
We don't need
your fuckin' permission.

481
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,093
<i>I got an idea that's gonna</i>
<i>save us that walk. </i>

482
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:37,190
- We give those damn demons
what they want.
- Mr. Roach,
