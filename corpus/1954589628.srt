00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:57,201
The war between the Humans and
the Cyborgs began 73 years ago.

2
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,700
Back in the year 2027.

3
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,900
10 years later the war was won by the Cyborgs.

4
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,700
They control the Earth and
the Humans became their slaves.

5
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
There were a scientist who
created a super-DNA gene...

6
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,500
...which would produce a man
with extraordinary powers.

7
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
A woman, Zana, was chosen to give birth
for this mutant human.

8
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Zana knew where a special craft was hiden.

9
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,900
A craft stolen from the Cyborgs
that can travel throught time.

10
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:41,200
Scch, Alex! You have to be quiet,
until we know where we are.

11
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,300

13
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,700
You have Powers, Alex.

14
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:20,501
When you are ready this neckless
will explain everything.

15
00:08:27,902 --> 00:08:28,902
Goodbye my love.

16
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,000
They baby was called Alex after
her famous ancestor.

17
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And thou she was born in the year 2077 -

18
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:13,998
the destiny of her life was forged
in the late 20th century.

19
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:18,499
in grimm Wootan, East Africa.

20
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,600
What's wrong....  whats happened, ....

21
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,660
News: A collection of goldcoins has been
stolen from the museum in Mosar.

22
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Three American student worker are
suspected to have fled in an ultralight....

23
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,300
The government wants an evacuation
of all villages  between Karu and Mosar.

24
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,600
The Wootan rebels started a new offensive.

25
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:43,301
And groups of American mercenaries
has been hired by the rebel leadership.

26
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,400
They start to win the skirmishies and have already
taken over the old uranium mine in Dabar.

27
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,400
Because of your accent.

28
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:22,901
My accent. I've learn English
from mine workers.

29
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:29,000
You never had to learn English.
You came to us already knowing English.

30
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,900
What the hell are you, lass?
Such large muscles!

31
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,800
I pray that you're foreigner we can ransome.

32
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,800
You touch me and you're sick son of a bich!

33
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,400
Ooo... nasty talk for a yank
we are going to eat.

34
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:53,100
- You are sick!
- Want to see something really sick, yank?

35
00:34:58,001 --> 00:34:59,001
No, not me!

36
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,400
I told you to wait for me!

37
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,100
Lucky day.
I've got a captive.

38
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,200
The Americans pay dearly
for their children.

39
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I thought you were the one fighting for freedom.

40
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,200
Everyone has their home use.
Mine is to make the imperialists pay...

41
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,500
...in gold.

42
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,300
Look at all these muscles!

43
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:43,701
My god.

44
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,500
Come on, cut us free before
the rebel show.

45
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,800
Come on.

46
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,500
I can help with that!... Please.

47
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,900
Hey, don't leave us, please!
Please, don't leave us!

48
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,700
- I'll take you to my plane.
- What plane?

49
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,500
I fly through to Mosar.
From there we return to the States.

50
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:56,000
My sister and I are really sick of this country
and civil war, we just wanna go home.

51
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,900
My dad was an engineer,
and he is dead.

52
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
- Who pilots?
- Me. It was my dads plane ...

53
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,500
He hid it before the rebels got us.

54
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,800
- Come on.
- OK. Fly me away from here.

55
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:23,301
Its a deal.

56
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,300
This cloths are hard to come under hat .

57
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,700
Whats the idea, hah?

58
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:02,800
It will help us get past the Rebels.
You pretend to be my prisoners.

59
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,900
Just remember, its a cover.

60
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,400
What is it?

61
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,000
Follow me.

62
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,500
Stupid idiot! You deserved to die.

63
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,300
My bulletproof vest is ruined!

64
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,800
You are really something.
Been here a long time, huh?

65
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,600
The old mining plant?

66
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,300
Yeah, we needed a fuel pump.
My father was forced to land the plane.

67
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,800
We were looking for a pump,
when the rebels found us.

68
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:23,601
Dad was killed.

69
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:30,400
We run, we ended up up here.
You know the outpost is really close by.

70
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:31,401
Find the pump?

71
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,700
Yeah I can install it,
when we get to the plane.

72
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:52,500
Only we had to do the first time. its was just
to much for her, killing of our dad and everything

73
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,000
The mining plant is controlled
by Wootan bandits. Too risky.

74
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,300
- It is our only chance?
- Yes.

77
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:31,800
My dad worked for the goverment.
What brought you to Africa?

78
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:36,800
My mother. Murdered by rebels.

79
00:42:37,001 --> 00:42:38,301
Sorry.

80
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,900
It was a long time ago. I realy don't
remember her. I grew up in a tribe.

81
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:48,900
- You sound like an American.
- Holy Cross missionary were Americans.

82
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,700
- So your village were is close by?
- It's gone. Everyone dead.

83
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,900
.... rebels.
- No ... devil.

84
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,900
- So whats the story of your life?
- What do you mean?

85
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,300
Well, you are pretty muscular
aren't you, for a girl.

86
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,300
Its like you been here a long time.

87
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,000
Wait! Quick.

88
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:24,900
What ...... What? Come.

89
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,900
This is the only way to mine.

90
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,900
- I can not see anything.
- Now look. - Wait.

91
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,000
Find the girls.

94
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:00,000
- Try to escape and I kill you and your sister. 
- She is not my sister.

95
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
- And I can make a deal worth more than a rent. 
- How is that?

96
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,400
There is a treasure and a plane.

97
00:47:11,801 --> 00:47:16,301
You take me to it and I split the looth with you.

98
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,200
What about her?

99
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,200
I do not need any more partners. Do you?

100
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,800
Give me the gun.
Shoot her.

101
00:47:38,001 --> 00:47:39,001
Noo!

102
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,200
Drop your weapons.
Your bullets can't hurt me..

108
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,200
- Shitta.
- Shut up!

109
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:36,300
.... here. Find the white woman
and terminate her.

110
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,600
She is in sector 17.
Concentrate patrol in there.

111
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,600
- What do you want?

112
00:57:00,801 --> 00:57:03,101
An American. A rebel has her.

113
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,000
Information costs money.

114
00:57:07,101 --> 00:57:10,301
Yes, yes something I want.

115
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:18,200
- Don't hurt me, please.
- Please?

116
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,400
- Come on you want the information or what?

117
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:34,600
- You know, we usually kill girls down here.
- Here you are.

118
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,900
- Where are they?
- There, up on the ridge.

119
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,400
Make in a hurry. Someone is gone a find us.

120
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:20,800
I sent scout to make sure we are safe.
Enyoy your life, we are going to be rich.

121
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:29,900
Until he is back we have
time to change that!

122
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
- You saved me.
- Did I?

123
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,400
What do you think I liked it?
Just trying to stay alive.

124
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:16,100
I don't trust you.
but I need with the plane.

125
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:21,100
Frame me, I'll kill you.

126
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,200
I just want out of here alive.

127
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:58,400
What, what is it?
What?

128
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,500
Get down, get down.

129
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,300
Do you want another one of your friends to die?

130
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:03,500
No! Oh!

131
01:04:08,701 --> 01:04:12,901
You would be vaporized if you resist.
Remain in place.

132
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,100
Drop your weapon.

133
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:24,901
Why do you want me?

134
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:28,100
Because you are wanted by
my superiors for your genetics.

135
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,600
Your mother brought you
from our time to hide you.

136
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:34,001
My mother was from your world?

137
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,000
My world is a 100 years into the future.

138
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,400
It has takes me 20 years to locate you.

139
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:45,600
Now I scan you again
to confirm your genetic code.

140
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,400
After I receive confirmation,
you will acompany me back to my time.

141
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,500
- Can you still fly? I get you to
the plane, can you still fly?

142
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:56,500
- What was  it?
- Now wait here.

143
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:12,700
Get it back. Put it down.
Put it down! Now!

144
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:20,100
That gold is mine!
Step away from the plane. Go on.

145
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,100
Mine alone!

146
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,100
I deserve all of it!

147
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:04,100
Emily!

148
01:14:11,301 --> 01:14:12,901
Emily.

149
01:17:46,504 --> 01:17:47,704
Emily.

150
01:18:04,005 --> 01:18:08,705
Noo.
Aaaah.....
