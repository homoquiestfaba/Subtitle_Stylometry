1
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,448
Where's Manny?

2
00:01:25,693 --> 00:01:28,856
Tell him the ice cream man i's here.

3
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:46,542
Freeze. Hammer time.

4
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:54,413
Can we get down to business?

5
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:57,356
You got the money?

6
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:13,095
Tell him.

7
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,608
He said that
hes not gonna give you one red cent...

8
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,145
until you tell him
what flavor the ice cream is.

9
00:02:18,212 --> 00:02:20,612
Vanilla. Thats what you ordered.

10
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:26,044
- Tell him.
- Okay.

11
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:34,417
Its all about the Benjamins, baby!

12
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:37,087
Bring in the stuff.

13
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:43,095
- Arnold Schwarzenegger, funny man!
- Hes funny like that!

14
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:45,739
There is your ice cream.

15
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:53,139
Tell him. I see coming. He say...

16
00:02:57,285 --> 00:02:59,913
I tell him, I say Jesus.

17
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,395
He coming, and he say...

18
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,001
- Tell him.
- He say...

19
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:21,741
FBI. Youre under arrest.

20
00:03:21,809 --> 00:03:23,606
- Hes going to run.
- No, he aint.

21
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:25,168
You owe me $1.

22
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,981
Where are you going, big boy?

23
00:03:40,828 --> 00:03:44,389
Goddamn. Now lm going to bust your ass.

24
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:50,803
Is that all your big ass got?

25
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,978
- Enough.
- Kevin.

26
00:04:02,316 --> 00:04:04,682
All right, you two over here. Right now.

27
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,879
I swear III shoot both of you.

28
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:22,027
Damn, Marcus, why you always
got to pick the biggest dude?

29
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,730
I dont know. I like a challenge.

30
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:28,373
See, what did I tell you?

31
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:31,371
We did it, right? Didnt I tell you?

32
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,243
- No help. No backup.
- You the man.

33
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,443
Well get all the credit.
The biggest bust of our career.

34
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:41,313
400 keys of pure...

35
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:46,223
- Vanilla ice cream?
- What?

36
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:49,686
My man! Wheres the drugs?

37
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:52,297
I know nothing about drugs.

38
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:56,496
I sell ice cream. Strawberry. Vanilla.

39
00:04:56,737 --> 00:04:59,171
Neapolitan, for example.

40
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:06,107
Tell Manny his ice cream delivery is here.

41
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:12,714
Never mind. Wrong store.

42
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,848
FBI. Freeze!

43
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,829
- Marcus?
- Im good.

44
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:34,406
- Theyre moving.
- Lets go.

45
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:45,508
- Which one?
- I dont know.

46
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:50,289
- God.
- Damn.

47
00:05:52,026 --> 00:05:54,517
I told you we shouldve called for backup.

48
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:56,764
You know the Chiefs gonna kill us, right?

49
00:05:56,764 --> 00:05:57,696
You know the Chiefs gonna kill us, right?

50
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,467
Let me give you guys a little tip.

51
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:05,539
If youre going to
operate outside the channels...

52
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:08,507
do the whole renegade cop thing...

53
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,074
you might want to make sure
that you get the right guy.

54
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:17,908
Chief, we almost had the guy.

55
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:20,244
Our intelligence was just a little off.

56
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:22,448
Wait a minute. Intelligence?

57
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:26,293
Look around you, Copeland.
Theres nothing intelligent about this.

58
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,760
Now lm tired of your escapades.
I want them to stop.

59
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:31,764
The last thing I need is
to be the laughingstock of the Bureau.

60
00:06:31,832 --> 00:06:33,424
And furthermore, the...

61
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:36,766
Hold on. Hello? Baby, I cant talk.

62
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:40,170
The Chief is chewing my ass right now.
I got to call you back. Bye.

63
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:43,301
- Sorry, Chief.
- As I was saying...

64
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:50,916
Gordon here.

65
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,885
Yes, he is.

66
00:06:58,225 --> 00:06:59,988
- Its for you.
- Thank you.

67
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:03,053
- Baby, lm still with the Chief.
- No respect.

68
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,155
No, hes really not happy now.

69
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:09,066
Okay, I got to go. Bye. Thanks, Chief.

70
00:07:11,872 --> 00:07:15,638
You guys are... Get this place cleaned up.

71
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,104
I expect to have a full report
on my desk tomorrow.

72
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:21,147
- Yes, sir.
- And in the meantime...

73
00:07:21,215 --> 00:07:24,378
Im checking with the Bureau
to see if they got any openings...

74
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:26,443
in Iraq.

75
00:07:30,758 --> 00:07:34,558
The Dynamic Duo strikes again.
Way to go, Baskin and Robbin.

76
00:07:37,231 --> 00:07:40,394
Or is it Häag and Dazs?

77
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,835
Häag and Dazs. You wrote that?

78
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:46,839
Thats good, I like that.

79
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:49,774
- Later, Häag.
- Adiós, Dazs.

80
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,443
- I hate those guys, dude.
- Oh, God.

81
00:07:54,882 --> 00:07:58,147
All right.
Well, lets get this place cleaned up.

82
00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:00,687
- All right.
- Okay, so, you do the floor.

83
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:03,781
Clean all the ice cream up
and III go warm the car up.

84
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:17,196
Okay. So much for a hot meal.

85
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,375
- Hey, baby.
- Dont hey, baby me.

86
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:27,881
I cant believe you have me
sitting here all night worried about you.

87
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:29,575
All night? Baby...

88
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,614
its only 8:00.

89
00:08:32,853 --> 00:08:36,653
Look, after work, me and Kevin went
down to the bar and had a couple of drinks.

90
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,421
I know. I called the bar.
They said you left at 7:45.

91
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:43,930
I checked MapQuest. It only takes
six minutes to get there from here.

92
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:46,660
So, if you got somebody on the side,
you need to tell me.

93
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,134
Baby, listen to what you just say.

94
00:08:49,203 --> 00:08:53,435
MapQuest said it takes six minutes
to get here. I got here in eight.

95
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,771
Which means theres two minutes
unaccounted for.

96
00:08:55,843 --> 00:08:59,802
If I was cheating on you, dont you think
Id need more than two minutes?

97
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:03,580
You know what?
I aint going to deal with this.

98
00:09:03,651 --> 00:09:07,178
Im tired, okay?
I had a long day at work. I got shot at.

99
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:10,087
See, that is exactly what lm talking about.

100
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:11,818
We dont communicate.

101
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:15,692
- Okay, fine. You want to communicate?
- Yes.

102
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:19,656
Come on. Lets communicate. Okay?

103
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:22,727
Okay. Lets start with last week.

104
00:09:22,837 --> 00:09:23,861
Last week.

105
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,430
You and I were supposed
to go shopping together. We get to the mall.

106
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:30,568
I buy this beautiful dress,
I get my hair done.

107
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:35,312
You dont say anything. I dont know,
maybe you just dont want to...

108
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:40,815
Did you hear me just now?

109
00:09:41,255 --> 00:09:42,449
Tell me what I said.

110
00:09:42,523 --> 00:09:44,388
I heard everything. You was communicating.

111
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,325
Dont play with me right now.
I am not in the mood.

112
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:50,124
I cannot believe you came home late
and then you start...

113
00:09:50,197 --> 00:09:54,531
Marcus! You are falling asleep again.
I am talking to you.

114
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:57,696
I wasnt asleep, I was closing my eyes
and visualizing your words.

115
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:59,671
Oh, really? Visualizing?

116
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:02,867
Why dont you paint me a picture
of what I just said?

117
00:10:02,943 --> 00:10:05,070
- Hold on.
- You know why?

118
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,581
Because you are
falling asleep again. Marcus!

119
00:10:12,253 --> 00:10:17,156
We received this from Mr. Andrew Wilson,
CEO of Wilson Cruise Lines.

120
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:22,128
It was delivered to his home.
The girls in the photo are his daughters...

121
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:25,263
and heiresses to the Wilson fortune.

122
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,961
We believe
they are the kidnappers next victims.

123
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:33,338
Mr. Wilson has given us permission
to shadow his daughters.

124
00:10:33,407 --> 00:10:35,637
Were going to set up surveillance...

125
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:37,267
and if the kidnapper strikes...

126
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:40,609
this time we will be ready.

127
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:45,515
Now, the Wilson sisters will be flying
into JFK this morning.

128
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:48,585
So whos going to pick them up?

129
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,620
Obviously, everyone has read
the profile on the girls.

130
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:57,764
Still, somebodys got to do it.

131
00:10:58,065 --> 00:10:59,794
I dont think this is a good idea.

132
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:03,860
I dont care. We deserve to be on this case
just as much as Gomez and Harper.

133
00:11:03,938 --> 00:11:06,771
I know, but we dont want
to interrupt the man in a briefing.

134
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,138
Well, somebody got to stand up to him.

135
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:12,211
- Chief.
- What?

136
00:11:12,346 --> 00:11:15,144
- Marcus has something he want to tell you.
- What?

137
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:18,343
Chief, we just want to know
if we could get on the case.

138
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:19,511
Youre on.

139
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:24,656
The boys over at Intel seem to think
that the kidnappers a guy...

140
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,987
named Ted Burton.

141
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,153
It says Burton was a partner of Wilsons...

142
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,255
and some other associates
in some business venture that failed.

143
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:34,927
Says he spent time in the Federal pen
and lost his fortune.

144
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:39,029
Guys been MIA since his release and those
dates coincide with the first kidnappings.

145
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:42,098
- What do you think?
- I think this babysitting gig sucks.

146
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:43,507
Dude, relax.

147
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,068
Look, man.
All we got to do is pick these chicks up...

148
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:49,741
drop their ass off in the Hamptons,
then we back in the Chiefs good graces.

149
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:51,785
I didnt join the FBI to become a nanny.

150
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:53,979
I want to be on the street
where the action is.

151
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:57,820
Okay, Blackie Chan, and youll get there.
Can we just do this first, please?

152
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:01,156
- All right.
- You didnt put dairy in this, did you?

153
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:04,055
- No.
- Because you know lm lactose intolerant.

154
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:06,099
Last time, I barely made it to the bathroom.

155
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,634
Why would I want to disturb your stomach?

156
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:12,769
There goes your girls.

157
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,105
Come on, man. Lets do this.

158
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:26,213
- Hi, lm Kevin Copeland. This is...
- We already gave to the United Negro Fund.

159
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,314
- Wait. Hold on.
- Excuse us.

160
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,919
Were actually here
to escort you ladies to the Hamptons.

161
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:37,462
The bags are on the plane.
Take Baby and clean out his bag.

162
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:40,694
He didnt have his colonic
and he like pooped everywhere.

163
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:52,871
- Whats this?
- Baby got to ride in the car seat.

164
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:55,310
Where the hell am I supposed to sit?

165
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:56,747
This aint right.

166
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,963
Man, you guys sure got a lot of bags
for a weekend.

167
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:17,567
- This isnt a weekend.
- Its the weekend.

168
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:21,266
Labor Day in the Hamptons.
The last weekend of the social season.

169
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,400
Only the hottest people
are going to be there.

170
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:27,413
And only the hottest of the hottest
are going to make it onto the cover...

171
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:30,450
of Hamptons Magazine. And this is our year.

172
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:35,087
Open the window.
Baby likes a little fresh breeze.

173
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:38,647
I just hope the Vandergeld sisters
private jet crashes on the way there.

174
00:13:38,726 --> 00:13:41,661
- Oh, my God, Brittany!
- You were thinking it!

175
00:13:41,729 --> 00:13:44,027
- I know, but you said it.
- I know.

176
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:47,534
You know Heather totally hates you
because you slept with her boyfriend.

177
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:50,866
My God. So what?
I sleep with everyones boyfriend.

178
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:31,804
Is everybody all right?

179
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:34,471
My God! Your lip.

180
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:36,379
My God! Your nose.

181
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:42,053
Marcus, are you okay?

182
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:44,718
- Im cool.
- Babys in a wreck!

183
00:14:46,894 --> 00:14:48,452
I cant believe...

184
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:53,228
you think were going to go to the Hamptons
with my face looking like that.

185
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:56,865
Its really not that bad.
Just get some makeup and cover it up.

186
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,201
Put makeup on this?

187
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,066
I am so fricking pissed.

188
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,075
My God, this is like the worst day of my life.

189
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:08,080
I went to go get my brows done...

190
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:10,275
and I told her to make me look like J-Lo.

191
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,978
And then that fricking Russian toad
made me look...

192
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:15,283
like Liza Minnelli or something.

193
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:19,048
Oh, my God! Lm going to have a B.F.

194
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:20,859
Wait. Whats a B.F.?

195
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:22,953
Shes going to have a bitch fit!

196
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,726
- You better get out of here.
- I am going to call your boss.

197
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,064
- You dont have to do that.
- No, III call the owner of the company.

198
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,196
Come on, just take it easy.
Look, we can work this out.

199
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,170
- Im going to write a letter.
- No.

200
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:37,836
Please dont write a letter.
Look, just calm down.

201
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:40,436
You guys just stay here.
Stay here the whole weekend.

202
00:15:40,514 --> 00:15:43,642
Do whatever you want. But whatever you do,
do not leave this room.

203
00:15:43,717 --> 00:15:47,744
Dont leave this room, because if you do,
everyones gonna see those hideous scars.

204
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,220
Scar?

205
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:53,919
- My God! Permanent damage.
- My life is over.

206
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:58,162
If I lose this job with these good benefits,
Ginas gonna kill me.

207
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,496
- Well?
- They wont go.

208
00:16:04,104 --> 00:16:06,971
- What do you mean, they wont go?
- They wont go.

209
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,339
Marcus, this weekend in the Hamptons
means everything for these girls.

210
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,813
They wont show up with a scratched-up
nose and a busted lip for nobody.

211
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:21,185
Thats cool.

212
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,314
What are you doing?

213
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:26,825
Lm just going to kill myself before
the Chief does.

214
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:28,452
- Bye-bye, Kevin.
- Come on.

215
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,190
Dont do that. Stop being ridiculous.

216
00:16:30,264 --> 00:16:32,391
Im not being ridiculous. You heard the man.

217
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:34,161
One more screw-up, and were through.

218
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:37,260
- I know, man.
- See? Thats probably him right now.

219
00:16:38,438 --> 00:16:40,030
Hey, whats up, Chief?

220
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:42,371
Theres something me and Kevin

221
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:44,672
Yeah, Chief? Hey.

222
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:48,212
Me and Marcus just wanted to thank you
for the opportunity, man.

223
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:49,749
No, we didnt.

224
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:51,647
Yeah, we really appreciate it.

225
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:54,016
They wanted to stop off
and get something to eat.

226
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:55,349
Hes lying to...

227
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,356
Two, three hours max.

228
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,320
Trust me.

229
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:06,730
If I dont have them there in three hours,
III cut them off and mail them to you myself.

230
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,701
- All right, take care. Bye.
- He lied, Chief.

231
00:17:10,771 --> 00:17:14,832
Why did you do that? You know them girls
arent going to be there.

232
00:17:14,942 --> 00:17:16,569
Theyll be there.

233
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:19,301
Hey, Josh.

234
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:23,012
Howd you like to be part of the team?

235
00:17:23,483 --> 00:17:25,007
Where are the white women at?

236
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,347
Lets do this.

237
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,500

00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:52,131
Chief. Theyre here.

240
00:18:52,205 --> 00:18:55,732
All right, the girls are yours.
Stick with them. Dont blow your cover.

241
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:56,798
Yes, sir.

242
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,807
- Are you sure this is going to work?

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,084
And you better start acting like one

250
00:19:41,154 --> 00:19:44,146
Damn. Id sure like to cut that cake.

251
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,918

252
00:19:45,992 --> 00:19:47,926

255
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,831
Welcome to the Royal Hamptons Hotel.

- Yeah, great. Here. Take Baby.

258
00:20:01,641 --> 00:20:04,235
Clean out his bag.
Poor thing just pooped everywhere.

259
00:20:04,311 --> 00:20:06,506
And teach him how to say,
"Quiero Taco Bell.

260
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,344
- Thanks a lot, Rico Suave. Grazie.

261
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,077
Right away, maam.

262
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:23,619
Sweetie, youve got to slow up
with those Cosmos.

263
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:28,497
Brittany and Tiffany Wilson, checking in.

264
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:31,062
Sorry. Theyre new.

265
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:35,204
- Dr. Dorfman did an amazing job.
- They feel so real.

266
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,737
Hi. Yeah, I just...

- Maam, l...

271
00:20:54,528 --> 00:20:57,725
I go to Dr. Dorfman.
He totally messes up my nose job.

272
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,858
I ask him to make me
look like Gwyneth Paltrow.

273
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:05,264
I get off the surgery table
looking like freaking Shrek.

274
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:09,968
Then I get here, and Mr. Harper...

275
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:14,070

lm some dumb blonde with fake boobs...

276
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,282

277
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:18,283
No. I didnt mean to offend you.

278
00:21:18,351 --> 00:21:20,615
- Its just protocol.

279
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:22,985

00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:26,890
No. Dont have a B.F. Now...

281
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,657
I want to speak to your supervisor.
Better yet, lm going to write a letter.

282
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,494
- Miss, theres no reason to...
- You are in big trouble.

283
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:36,468

286
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,905
- in America.
- Ladies, is there a problem here?

287
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:49,505

288
00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:51,981
Theres no problem.

These are two of our VIP guests.

290
00:21:54,955 --> 00:21:57,150
Issue them keys. Immediately.

291
00:21:59,092 --> 00:22:00,889
VIP. Learn your acronyms.

292
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:05,357
- What a sweetheart.
- Here you are. Enjoy your stay.

293
00:22:05,465 --> 00:22:09,595
Has anyone ever told you
you look just like Denzel Washington?

294
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:15,465
Yes, actually I have heard it once or twice.

295
00:22:18,445 --> 00:22:20,777
What a beautiful chocolate man.

296
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,346
Beautiful. God.

297
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,612

298
00:22:30,624 --> 00:22:32,558

- I dont know.

299
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:35,561
- What are we going to do?
- Just act friendly.

300
00:22:38,098 --> 00:22:39,895
My God.

301
00:22:43,837 --> 00:22:46,670
Well, dont act like you dont know us.

302
00:22:49,976 --> 00:22:52,467
Karen, Lisa, Tori.

303
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:54,737
Oh, my God.

304
00:22:55,715 --> 00:22:58,650
I havent seen you in forever.

305
00:22:59,085 --> 00:23:00,245
Its only been a year.

306
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,221
Did you do something different
to your hair?

307
00:23:03,356 --> 00:23:05,153
- No.
- You gain weight?

308
00:23:06,326 --> 00:23:09,921
- No.
- I know! You just had a birthday.

309
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:15,361
- Yeah.
- Totally. Total fire sign. I knew it.

310
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,335
- I totally knew it.
- Wait a minute.

311
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:19,929
There is definitely...

312
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,741
something different about the two of you.

313
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,543
Collagen.

314
00:23:31,885 --> 00:23:34,752
You little witch. How did you know?

315
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:39,724
Duh, its totally obvious.
Your lips went from Cameron Diaz to Jay-Z.

316
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,493
You got taller, too.

317
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,666
We got our knees done.

318
00:23:51,037 --> 00:23:52,902
You can do that?

319
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,463
- You should do that.
- Yes.

320
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:57,009
Well, it was really good
seeing you ladies. Bye.

321
00:23:57,077 --> 00:23:59,545
Excuse me.
Where do you think youre going?

322
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,613
To go freshen up.

323
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:05,412
The Hamptons Magazine reception
just started, so lets hit it.

324
00:24:09,756 --> 00:24:11,451
Hey, check it out.

325
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:14,322
Are those the Wilson sisters?

326
00:24:14,394 --> 00:24:18,831
More like the Wilt Chamberlain sisters.
I never noticed how big they are.

327
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:21,662
But Id still bone.

328
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:25,401
My God. Theres Heath.

329
00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:32,302
Dude, are you hitting Karen Googlestein,
the soap heiress, too?

330
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:34,176
How do you keep that shit dangling?

331
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:36,807
I keep telling her lm going to break
up with my girl.

332
00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:38,783
You better hope Heather doesnt find out.

333
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,183
She wont.

334
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,287
At least until I wrap up this big deal
with her father.

335
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,721
Hey, Mr. V.

336
00:24:49,095 --> 00:24:52,155
And look, there they are.
The fen-phen twins.

337
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:54,298
Theyre hot.

338
00:24:54,768 --> 00:24:56,395
What, are you blind?

339
00:24:56,469 --> 00:24:58,528
Thats Heather and Megan Vandergeld.

340
00:24:58,605 --> 00:25:01,665
Your sworn enemies since you were like,
I dont know. Eight?

341
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:04,676
Did I say hot? I meant not.

342
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,707
- I totally hate them.
- Did you guys hear about Megan?

343
00:25:07,781 --> 00:25:11,911
She got stopped by security at Saks
trying to pull a Winona.

344
00:25:17,323 --> 00:25:20,383
God. Come on.

345
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:28,924
- This is going to be fun.
- Move.

346
00:25:29,436 --> 00:25:33,668
Look who just flew in from the slums
of Beverly Hills.

347
00:25:34,007 --> 00:25:36,202
Its The Beverly Ho-billies.

348
00:25:38,845 --> 00:25:42,281
- Squeeze me?
- No, you didnt.

349
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:45,682
Im sorry, but we just saw your new video.

350
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,414
They had a screening
over at Saks Fifth Avenue...

351
00:25:48,488 --> 00:25:50,388
in the security office.

352
00:25:51,691 --> 00:25:53,591
A klept-ho-maniac.

353
00:25:56,529 --> 00:25:58,929
Your mother shops at Saks.

354
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:00,925
What?

355
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:07,562
My God. You want to talk about mothers?

356
00:26:08,675 --> 00:26:12,111
You want to talk about mothers.

357
00:26:12,178 --> 00:26:15,011
Its mother time. Okay.

358
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:18,642
Your mothers so dumb
she went to Dr. Dre for a Pap smear.

359
00:26:18,718 --> 00:26:22,415
Somethings wrong, Dr. Dre.
My coochies doing a beatbox.

360
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:24,719
Yeah? Well, your mother is so stupid...

361
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,191
she exercises when she could just get...

362
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,251
liposuction or something.

363
00:26:29,395 --> 00:26:33,855
Your mothers so old that her breast milk
is powdered. You breast-feed like this.

364
00:26:36,503 --> 00:26:38,528
Your mother is so, like...

365
00:26:39,305 --> 00:26:40,704
Shes so...

366
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,632
Megan, you go.

367
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:46,101
Your mother is so stupid...

368
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:49,080
that she goes to Barneys Rooftop
Deck Restaurant for lunch...

369
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:53,176
and orders a nicoise salad and calls it
a ni-coise salad.

370
00:26:53,253 --> 00:26:55,050
Ni-coise salad, right?

371
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,214
Your mothers ass is so hairy...

372
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:01,522
it looks like Don Kings about to pop out
and say, Only in America!

373
00:27:02,028 --> 00:27:03,757
Your mothers so stupid...

374
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:07,596
that she goes into Gucci
and she tries to buy, like, Fendi and stuff.

375
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:11,763
Megan, Heather. Come on now, girls.
Is this any way to speak to your guests?

376
00:27:12,739 --> 00:27:14,866
Brittany and Tiffany Wilson.

377
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:18,570
I havent seen you since you were smaller.

378
00:27:18,978 --> 00:27:22,004
Yeah. Well, were all grown up now.

379
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:23,776
Yeah, I can see that.

380
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,047
Ladies, I fully expect
to see you later at the White Party.

381
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,749
- I think its gonna be the best one ever.
- Well be there.

382
00:27:31,357 --> 00:27:34,656
- Take care. Bye. Good seeing you again.
- Bye, Mr. V.

383
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:38,192
This isnt over yet.

384
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:42,598
This is a long weekend.
You better watch your back.

385
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,268
- Ladies.
- Whatever.

386
00:27:48,441 --> 00:27:52,070
I cant believe you guys just did that
to the Vandergelds.

387
00:27:52,145 --> 00:27:55,774
You know, they could take you
off the scene just like that.

388
00:27:55,848 --> 00:27:59,944
- Yeah, but it was so cool, you guys.
- So cool.

389
00:28:02,121 --> 00:28:05,750
Isnt that Denise Porter from NY1 News?

390
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:09,225
Yeah, lm working on getting you
an interview with her.

391
00:28:09,295 --> 00:28:10,728
Great for your image.

392
00:28:10,797 --> 00:28:13,891
I think III go over there
and introduce myself.

393
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:17,330
- Do you think nows a good time?
- Actually, its a perfect time.

394
00:28:17,403 --> 00:28:20,634
- Wouldnt want to miss a photo op.
- Never that.

395
00:28:20,707 --> 00:28:21,969
- See you later.
- Have fun.

396
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,441
- Whats wrong? Did you just get cramps?
- Yeah.

397
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:27,673
- Do you need a tamp?
- Heating pad?

398
00:28:27,814 --> 00:28:31,147
- Hors doeuvres?
- Thank you, Wolfgang Paco.

399
00:28:32,285 --> 00:28:34,845
Would you give that to Baby? Thank you.

400
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,951
- Bye, Chico. Vamonos.

402
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,857
- Hi, my name is...
- Brittany Wilson, of course.

403
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:48,298
Yeah. Howd you know? Brittany Wilson.

404
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,228
Well, its my job to know.

405
00:28:50,303 --> 00:28:55,104
Your publicist, Tori, has been calling me
nonstop about setting up an interview.

406
00:28:55,174 --> 00:29:00,043
If I wouldve known you were so beautiful,
I probably wouldve called you myself.

407
00:29:01,147 --> 00:29:05,811
Well, if I wasnt mistaken, Id think
you were flirting with me, Miss Wilson.

408
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:11,618
Me? Flirting with you? A girl? Never.

409
00:29:13,192 --> 00:29:15,160
Sorry, honey. Only beef.

410
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:20,760
- Boy, youre really strong, arent you?
- Its from all that protein.

411
00:29:22,602 --> 00:29:26,003
My God. These are delicious.

412
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,938
You might want to slow down
on the cheese.

413
00:29:31,444 --> 00:29:35,244
You mean, theres cheese,
as in dairy cheese?

414
00:29:35,548 --> 00:29:38,711
Yeah. Unless you know another way
to make quiche.

415
00:29:44,123 --> 00:29:47,524
- Ladies, I think I got to go to the bathroom.
- Good. Well come with.

416
00:29:47,593 --> 00:29:50,460
No, I can handle it myself.
Thank you, though.

417
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:53,124
Like were going to let you go alone.

418
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:56,058
Time for touchups anyway.

419
00:29:57,437 --> 00:29:58,836
Move, bitch.

420
00:30:16,322 --> 00:30:18,688
My God, you guys.
Heath is here. What should I do?

421
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:20,749
I dont understand what you see in him.

422
00:30:20,827 --> 00:30:23,557
Hes an out-of-work actor
living in a share house.

423
00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:25,688
And he drives a 3 Series BMW.

424
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:32,300
Tori, I really think that you need
to cut Heath a little bit of slack.

425
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,432
His aunt died three years ago
and he really needs new headshots.

426
00:30:35,508 --> 00:30:38,807
Hes just going through
a really rough time right now. Okay?

427
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,581
You okay?

428
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:52,319
Everything all right in there?

429
00:30:53,092 --> 00:30:55,458
Its fine. Shit.

430
00:30:55,695 --> 00:30:58,858
Tiff, were just going to
meet you outside. Okay?

431
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,801
Love you.

432
00:31:08,107 --> 00:31:11,338
Man, it may be summertime
in the Hamptons...

433
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,903
but it is snowing up in here.

434
00:31:16,716 --> 00:31:19,742
Tony, hand me my boots
because lm about to go skiing.

435
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,415
- Great game last night, Latrell.
- Thats what I do, baby.

436
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,058
Now thats what lm talking about.

437
00:31:35,802 --> 00:31:39,101
A white girl with a black girls ass.

438
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:42,004
Im taking that home to Mama.

439
00:31:44,343 --> 00:31:45,674
Pardon me.

440
00:31:46,212 --> 00:31:48,646
Santa mustve come early this year...

441
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,883
because you were first on my Christmas list.

442
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,915
There it is, right there.

443
00:31:53,986 --> 00:31:58,184
I want to know. Are you naughty or nice?

444
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:01,884
Sorry, lm not interested.

445
00:32:03,496 --> 00:32:07,432
- Ill take that as naughty.
- Naughty.

446
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:09,496
You know what they say:

447
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:13,027
Once you go black,
youre going to need a wheelchair.

448
00:32:17,243 --> 00:32:19,711
- Okay, call me later.
- As I was saying...

449
00:32:19,912 --> 00:32:23,780
Look, King Kong. Why dont you take you
and your 1980 pickup lines...

450
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:27,616

beat on your big old monkey chest...

451
00:32:27,687 --> 00:32:30,019
and then jump off? Excuse me.

452
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,481
Hold up, hold on now. Ill get the...

453
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:35,459
- This is no joke, man.
- Get your hands off me, man.

454
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:41,899
She dont know it yet,
but thats wifey right there.

455
00:32:42,235 --> 00:32:44,703

Its a perfect fit.

512
00:36:24,457 --> 00:36:27,187
- I cant believe what I just heard.
- I told you.

513
00:36:28,194 --> 00:36:29,684
Im exhausted.

514
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:33,923
Gina. Damn. Hello? Baby?

515
00:36:49,315 --> 00:36:50,680
What do you think?

516
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:55,346
That looks so sexy.

517
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,183
Are you kidding?

518
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:05,195
Hi, lm Cellulite Sally.
Look at my huge bedonkey.

519
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,824
And dont forget about me.
Im Back Fat Betty.

520
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,367
Now who could have said that?

521
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:12,893
Yeah, its Tina the Talking Tummy.

522
00:37:13,506 --> 00:37:15,940
I cant even wear a short skirt...

523
00:37:16,008 --> 00:37:19,466
and a top without looking like a fat pig.

524
00:37:19,812 --> 00:37:24,249
Calm down. Ill go see if theres something
else out there for you. Okay?

525
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:31,745
Do you think Heath will love...
Do you need help?

526
00:37:33,392 --> 00:37:35,360
I think I need a bigger size.

527
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:38,590
Honey, you never need a bigger size.
Come here.

528
00:37:38,664 --> 00:37:41,963
Let me show you a little trick.
Brace yourself.

529
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,635
Suck it in. Squeeze those cheeks, sister.

530
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,267
Suck it in. Come on. Work with me.

531
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:53,738
Dont give up on me.
You can do this. Suck it in.

532
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,839
Now that looks totally cute.

533
00:37:57,917 --> 00:37:59,782
My God! Are you kidding?

534
00:37:59,852 --> 00:38:04,255
Hi, lm Carnie Wilson before my
gastric bypass surgery.

535
00:38:04,356 --> 00:38:07,257
Well, what about this?
This goes with your skin tone.

536
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:10,454
Somebody throw Shamu back in the ocean!

537
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:14,057
Okay. Let me get you something else. Okay?

538
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,866
Hows that?

539
00:38:17,269 --> 00:38:19,737
I cant breathe.

540
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,734
Honey, this is just not going to work.
Im sorry.

541
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:26,937
Well, of course not.
Youre wearing the wrong underwear.

542
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:30,739
Is that better?

543
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:33,985
I can taste the leather.

544
00:38:34,286 --> 00:38:38,245
Okay, you need a pair of hot shoes.
What size do you wear again?

545
00:38:39,258 --> 00:38:40,850
- Fourteen.
- What?

546
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,165
Do you think you could bring us a size 10?

547
00:38:50,236 --> 00:38:51,794
- A what?
- A 10.

548
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,860
Its an open-toed slide.

549
00:38:52,938 --> 00:38:55,600
It gives you two sizes in the front
and two in the back.

550
00:38:55,674 --> 00:38:59,371
- What about these? This ones...
- You bitch! Thats so terrible.

551
00:38:59,445 --> 00:39:01,709
Let me go
and see if theres some help out there.

552
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,613
Some professional help.
You need professional help. Hang on.

553
00:39:04,683 --> 00:39:07,584
- Okay.
- Dr. Phil!

554
00:39:07,987 --> 00:39:10,080
Oprah. Somebody, help me.

555
00:39:12,124 --> 00:39:14,490
Come on out, honey. Lets see.

556
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:21,399
It is absolutely fabulous.
If you dont buy it, lm buying it for myself.

557
00:39:23,168 --> 00:39:25,898
I dont know. Stand up straight.

558
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,811
Turn around.

559
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,511
Honey, just relax. Breathe.

560
00:39:53,966 --> 00:39:56,025
You know what? Maybe a nice dress.

561
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,829
Okay. Who would you do?

562
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:03,139
Janet Reno or Rosie ODonnell?

563
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:06,809
- What! Are you kidding me?
- And death is not an option.

564
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:12,079
I dont know. Rosie.

565
00:40:12,217 --> 00:40:15,152
- Youre a pig. Thats disgusting.
- What are you talking about?

566
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,246
- Rosies all right.
- Heads up. Here they are.

567
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:23,719
- Hold on. Who would you do?
- No time. Were on the job.

568
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,662
- Hes got my gun and badge.
- Go get him!

569
00:40:31,036 --> 00:40:32,936
Get in! Get in the car.

570
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:37,505
My God, I need a cigarette!

571
00:40:39,445 --> 00:40:41,743
- Can you believe this?
- What do we do?

572
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,339
We follow them.
But we cant blow our cover.

573
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,553
- Give me back my bag.
- Oh, man.

574
00:40:50,522 --> 00:40:52,422
Ill rip your head off.

575
00:40:53,525 --> 00:40:55,152
Your ass is mine.

576
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:58,720
What is this girl, a track star?

577
00:41:08,374 --> 00:41:10,899
You messed
with the wrong blonde today, pal.

578
00:41:18,117 --> 00:41:20,347
- Holy Christ.
- Now lm pissed.

579
00:41:21,053 --> 00:41:22,816
I think shes bionic, dude.

580
00:41:30,162 --> 00:41:31,561
Holy smokes.

581
00:41:32,598 --> 00:41:36,534
- That was nice.
- Jeez, lady. All that for a bag?

582
00:41:37,236 --> 00:41:40,728
Its not just a bag. Its Prada.

583
00:41:50,649 --> 00:41:53,379
- It was like a reality show.
- It was so cool.

584
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:21,177
- Right behind you.
- Nice going, Tori.

585
00:42:21,246 --> 00:42:25,080
Way to get us sat at the losers table.
I thought you had it all hooked up.

586
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,641
Excuse me. I do have the hook-up.

587
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,653
Dont blame me.
Blame Little Miss Def Jam over here...

588
00:42:30,722 --> 00:42:33,122
who had to go, Yo mama
on the Vandergelds.

589
00:42:33,192 --> 00:42:34,682
We could be finished in this town.

590
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,059
- Somebody had to stand up to those guys.
- Theyre the it girls.

591
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:41,065
- Thats the way its always been.
- Whatever.

592
00:42:44,236 --> 00:42:46,431
Honey, quick. Give me a pat.

593
00:42:48,373 --> 00:42:50,705
No, a powder for my nose. Quick.

594
00:42:53,979 --> 00:42:55,173
Thanks.

595
00:42:58,684 --> 00:43:00,481
No, lm just kidding.

596
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,626
I tried to call you,
but your number changed?

597
00:43:12,764 --> 00:43:15,096
Yeah, I know. I changed it.

598
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,666
Anyway, so, I was just wondering if maybe...

599
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,232
later we could...

600
00:43:23,842 --> 00:43:28,279
Hello. Where have you been all night?
Lve been looking all over for you.

601
00:43:31,116 --> 00:43:33,209
Why are you talking to her?

602
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,287
Clean it up, coke whore.

603
00:43:40,692 --> 00:43:42,887
Do you have any more of that?

604
00:43:42,961 --> 00:43:44,986
Dont hate me because you aint me.

605
00:43:45,063 --> 00:43:47,190
Can I have your attention, please?

606
00:43:47,266 --> 00:43:49,427
Gentlemen, get out your wallets...

607
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,526
because youll be bidding on a date...

608
00:43:51,603 --> 00:43:54,800
with some of Hamptons
most eligible bachelorettes.

609
00:43:54,873 --> 00:43:57,273
First up, yours truly.

610
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,835
Who wants to start the bidding?

611
00:44:04,316 --> 00:44:06,511
- $500?
- $500.

612
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:09,412
Okay. Do I hear $1,000?

613
00:44:09,955 --> 00:44:12,981
Well, looks like were all
on the Vandergelds D-list.

614
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:15,923
- Is this seat taken?
- Oh, no. Have a seat.

615
00:44:17,996 --> 00:44:22,330
Can you believe this?
Theyre actually auctioning off women.

616
00:44:23,135 --> 00:44:27,765
- Would you ever do anything like that?
- Well, its for a good cause.

617
00:44:28,073 --> 00:44:31,338
Besides, being wined and dined
by a rich guy might be nice.

618
00:44:32,511 --> 00:44:34,706
I see, so you like rich guys?

619
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,008
It might be a pleasant change
from all the losers that ask me out.

620
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:39,710
- $3,000.
- Thats good.

621
00:44:39,785 --> 00:44:40,809
I see.

622
00:44:40,919 --> 00:44:43,353
But I think that we can do better than that.

623
00:44:43,422 --> 00:44:46,118
- $20,000.
- Sold.

624
00:44:46,758 --> 00:44:50,922
$20,000. That is a new record.

625
00:44:52,097 --> 00:44:53,758
That is very good.

626
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:59,233
Next to be auctioned is Tiffany Wilson.

627
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,639
- Thats you.
- Me?

628
00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:05,577
You better do something.

629
00:45:05,978 --> 00:45:08,572
Excuse me, honey. Ill be right back.

630
00:45:15,621 --> 00:45:17,919
Who wants to start the bidding?

631
00:45:18,023 --> 00:45:19,047
$4.

632
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:24,389
$4. Do I hear $5?

633
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,998
$1,000.

634
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:32,093
$1,000. Does anyone wish to go higher?

635
00:45:32,304 --> 00:45:34,238
Yeah, I got $2,000 right here.

636
00:45:35,407 --> 00:45:37,568
$3,000.

637
00:45:38,176 --> 00:45:39,871
$5,000.

638
00:45:40,178 --> 00:45:41,668
Who said that?

639
00:45:43,815 --> 00:45:46,841
$5,000 to the dirty geezer in the back.

640
00:45:46,918 --> 00:45:49,216
Im sure no one will wish
to go higher than that...

641
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,846
so we can just be done with it now.

642
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:53,186
$10,000.

643
00:45:53,992 --> 00:45:55,220
$20,000.

644
00:45:56,762 --> 00:46:00,721
$20,000! Going once, going twice...

645
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:05,133
$50,000. Cash!

646
00:46:08,273 --> 00:46:09,365
Fine.

647
00:46:10,575 --> 00:46:11,769
Sold...

648
00:46:12,244 --> 00:46:14,644
to the big black guy right there.

649
00:46:15,213 --> 00:46:17,374
Step right up and claim your prize.

650
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,488
I dont want
to go on a date with Buff Daddy.

651
00:46:24,556 --> 00:46:26,148
Come here, baby.

652
00:46:33,065 --> 00:46:35,863
Dude, my feet are killing me.

653
00:46:36,802 --> 00:46:40,203
And on top of that, that G-string
gave me diaper rash.

654
00:46:40,272 --> 00:46:43,173
- How long we got to do this, man?
- Just a couple more days.

655
00:46:43,241 --> 00:46:46,438
I dont have a couple of more days.
Do you know who my wife is?

656
00:46:46,511 --> 00:46:49,503
Here, listen to this message.
Shes losing her mind.

657
00:46:49,881 --> 00:46:52,509
...with another woman
doing what I think youre doing!

658
00:46:52,584 --> 00:46:53,983
You dont want to hear the rest.

659
00:46:54,052 --> 00:46:58,216
By the end of the weekend,
well be heroes and all will be forgiven.

660
00:46:58,957 --> 00:47:00,288
All right.

661
00:47:02,527 --> 00:47:04,654
- You order room service?
- No.

662
00:47:09,134 --> 00:47:10,465
Who is it?

663
00:47:15,474 --> 00:47:17,669
Damn! These girls wont quit.

664
00:47:19,144 --> 00:47:22,307
Well be right there. Were coming. Hang on.

665
00:47:25,016 --> 00:47:26,643
- Open up!
- Open.

666
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:27,980
One second.

667
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,817
Well be right there. Hang on.

668
00:47:31,089 --> 00:47:32,886
The ice creams melting!

669
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:37,019
Hold tight, girls!
Were just shaving our feet, okay?

670
00:47:38,163 --> 00:47:40,188
And braiding our vaginas.

671
00:47:50,442 --> 00:47:54,139
What, did you guys forget?
Its your turn to host the slumber party.

672
00:47:59,851 --> 00:48:02,649
Okay, you guys. What does it mean...

673
00:48:02,954 --> 00:48:06,617
when a guy is in a really bad relationship...

674
00:48:06,858 --> 00:48:10,487
and its really obvious
that he wants to be with you...

675
00:48:10,796 --> 00:48:13,560
but he just cant seem to break up with
his girlfriend?

676
00:48:13,632 --> 00:48:15,998
It means youre a total booty call.

677
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,935
- My God! Brittany!
- Well, you were thinking it.

678
00:48:20,005 --> 00:48:21,666
Well, you said it.

679
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,502
You know,
sometimes you sound just like a man.

680
00:48:24,576 --> 00:48:26,237
So lve been told.

681
00:48:27,813 --> 00:48:29,940
What she means to say, honey...

682
00:48:30,015 --> 00:48:34,611
is maybe youre just making yourself
just a little bit too, like, available.

683
00:48:35,353 --> 00:48:37,150
Come on, you guys.

684
00:48:37,522 --> 00:48:40,355
Dont act like you havent done it before.

685
00:48:40,525 --> 00:48:43,824
You know how it is
when you really care about someone.

686
00:48:43,895 --> 00:48:45,226
You call them all day long...

687
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,697
because you just wanna know
how their day is going...

688
00:48:47,766 --> 00:48:51,827
and what theyre thinking about
and if theyre thinking about you.

689
00:48:52,871 --> 00:48:56,170
You spend all day trying to find
the perfect outfit.

690
00:48:56,274 --> 00:48:59,334
You even change your hairstyle
just so hell take a second look.

691
00:48:59,411 --> 00:49:01,276
But they never notice.

692
00:49:01,446 --> 00:49:04,609
Sometimes I just wish
that they could trade places with us...

693
00:49:04,683 --> 00:49:07,743
so that they would know how it feels.
You know?

694
00:49:08,186 --> 00:49:09,949
- All done.
- Really?

695
00:49:11,189 --> 00:49:14,056
My God! This is so cool.

696
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:15,387
You know something?

697
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,224
I think you might have been black
in a previous life.

698
00:49:18,296 --> 00:49:20,196
Fo shizzle, my nizzle.

699
00:49:21,466 --> 00:49:25,835
All right, I got another one for you.
Carmen Electra or Pam Anderson?

700
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,161
Easy.

701
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,936
But they both got a yeast infection.

702
00:49:32,377 --> 00:49:34,004
Now thats tough.

703
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:42,008
- Im going to go with Pam Anderson.
- Youre disgusting.

704
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,287
- What?
- They got a yeast infection.

705
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,787
Who would you choose?

706
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:50,726
Hey, Gomez. We got a couple of bogeys.

707
00:49:51,596 --> 00:49:53,587
- No time.
- Oh, come on!

708
00:49:54,099 --> 00:49:56,499
Its Pam Anderson, like you care.

709
00:50:00,071 --> 00:50:02,096
Run their faces. Lets go.

710
00:50:05,844 --> 00:50:08,244
- Brittany Wilson?
- Yeah, thats me.

711
00:50:08,313 --> 00:50:09,803
Lets get her.

712
00:50:12,617 --> 00:50:16,383
- Put the blindfold on her!
- Damn, this girls strong.

713
00:50:30,468 --> 00:50:32,936
- Who do you work for?
- Intimate Fantasies!

714
00:50:33,004 --> 00:50:34,699
My God. You need help?

715
00:50:34,773 --> 00:50:39,335
What are you doing?
Those are the strippers, Raoul and Tito.

716
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,742
Strippers?

717
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:48,417
- I thought they were going to kidnap me.
- Thats part of their routine.

718
00:50:48,486 --> 00:50:52,047
Oh, my God! I am so sorry.

719
00:50:52,123 --> 00:50:54,591
Hotel security! Is everything all right here?

720
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:58,390
Everything is fine.
Just a little case of PMS. Thats all.

721
00:50:58,463 --> 00:51:00,897
Im just one big, emotional wreck.

722
00:51:00,999 --> 00:51:03,991
Could you guys go
get me some Midol and a Snickers?

723
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:06,697
- Lets get out of here.
- My ass is fat.

724
00:51:07,005 --> 00:51:08,734
This is Harper. Its all clear.

725
00:51:15,213 --> 00:51:19,343
Okay, ladies. Lets focus.
We have to find the perfect spot.

726
00:51:19,918 --> 00:51:21,317
Skank alert.

727
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:32,120
My God, girls.
I totally forgot my suntan lotion.

728
00:51:32,197 --> 00:51:35,394
Im gonna get some suntan lotion.
Ill be right back.

729
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:36,861
Hey, Russ.

730
00:51:43,108 --> 00:51:46,373
Hey, bro. Go long. I got a plan. Go.

731
00:51:55,286 --> 00:51:58,449
Hey, yo! You do that again,
lm going to bust...

732
00:52:01,126 --> 00:52:03,026
Ill bust out in tears.

733
00:52:04,796 --> 00:52:06,957
- Inbreds!
- Youre a jerk.

734
00:52:09,734 --> 00:52:13,226
My bad, sweetheart. Over here.
Dont hurt yourself.

735
00:52:13,405 --> 00:52:16,374
Dont worry, I wont.

736
00:52:19,077 --> 00:52:21,511
Sorry. Better lay off the spinach.

737
00:52:35,994 --> 00:52:38,758
Tony. Lets go hunting.

738
00:52:57,182 --> 00:52:59,309
What a beautiful, sunny day.

739
00:53:03,822 --> 00:53:06,256
Oh, my God. What happened to the sun?

740
00:53:07,258 --> 00:53:09,123
Easy, white chocolate.

741
00:53:09,928 --> 00:53:11,759
I wouldnt want you to melt.

742
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:15,129
Yeah. Hasta la vista, Schwarzenegro. Bye.

743
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:28,370
Hey, kids! You guys want to make $5?

744
00:53:28,446 --> 00:53:29,674
Yeah! Sure!

745
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,909
Okay, heres what I want you to do.

746
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,447
Yeah, III take the usual.
And put it on my tab.

747
00:53:40,692 --> 00:53:43,252
Hey, Latrell Spencer!
Could we have your autograph?

748
00:53:43,328 --> 00:53:46,126
- Sure, little buddy.
- Thanks. Youre the greatest.

749
00:53:46,197 --> 00:53:48,290
Hey, thats what I do, baby.

750
00:53:50,201 --> 00:53:52,032
- Sweet!
- Nice!

751
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:55,004
- Hey, stay in school.
- Okay, we will!

752
00:53:56,374 --> 00:53:59,969
- Wow! You must be pretty good.
- Im all right.

753
00:54:01,012 --> 00:54:04,743
Sometimes I feel I should be paying them
to take my autograph.

754
00:54:04,949 --> 00:54:07,645
Im sorry, I didnt even get your name.

755
00:54:07,952 --> 00:54:11,945
Latrell. Latrell Spencer. And you are?

756
00:54:12,023 --> 00:54:15,550
- Denise Porter.
- Denise. Denise Porter.

757
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:19,621
You know, you look so familiar.
I feel like lve seen you somewhere.

758
00:54:19,697 --> 00:54:24,259
No. I play pro ball.
Maybe youve seen one of my games.

759
00:54:24,335 --> 00:54:28,999
No. But I mean if I did, lm sure
I wouldve definitely remembered you.

760
00:54:30,742 --> 00:54:33,939
Okay, well. Look, Denise...

761
00:54:34,779 --> 00:54:36,872
I dont mean to be too forward or anything...

762
00:54:36,948 --> 00:54:39,940
but lm here in town,
checking out some real estate, and...

763
00:54:40,018 --> 00:54:41,485
Oh, whereabouts?

764
00:54:41,953 --> 00:54:44,513
- You know, up around over there.
- In Montauk?

765
00:54:44,589 --> 00:54:47,456
- More like around...
- East Hampton.

766
00:54:47,525 --> 00:54:49,959
Just all over the place. Its one big blur.

767
00:54:50,028 --> 00:54:51,996
One big, business blur.

768
00:54:52,063 --> 00:54:55,123
I kind of want to
get away from all that business and...

769
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,691
hang out with somebody
and have a real conversation.

770
00:54:57,769 --> 00:55:00,602
So, I was wondering if youre not too busy...

771
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:03,470
- maybe we can hang out?
- Yeah, sure.

772
00:55:03,741 --> 00:55:07,438
- Really? All right. Cool!
- Yeah.

773
00:55:11,382 --> 00:55:13,782
So, III pick you up at about...

774
00:55:19,123 --> 00:55:22,559
You know,
the jet should be here about 7:30...

775
00:55:22,627 --> 00:55:26,757
and the limo will take about a half-hour.
About 8:00. Is that good?

776
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:30,767
- Yeah, 8:00 sounds great.
- 8:00 sounds good? All right.

777
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,300
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

778
00:55:37,442 --> 00:55:39,672
Hey, wheres our $5?

779
00:55:39,944 --> 00:55:41,741
All right, calm down.

780
00:55:43,448 --> 00:55:46,815
Here you go. $5. $2.50 each.

781
00:55:47,485 --> 00:55:50,079
- You promised to give us $5 each.
- Stay in school.

782
00:55:50,154 --> 00:55:51,143
Cheapo.

783
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:51,623
I am not making excuses.
I refuse to believe it.

784
00:55:51,623 --> 00:55:54,183
I am not making excuses.
I refuse to believe it.

785
00:55:54,259 --> 00:55:57,057
- Really?
- I dont want to believe Marcus is cheating.

786
00:55:57,128 --> 00:56:00,256
I dont wanna believe
Michael Jackson keeps carving up his nose.

787
00:56:00,331 --> 00:56:03,732
Excuse me. Your card has been declined
for insufficient funds.

788
00:56:03,835 --> 00:56:05,700
The reps on the line.

789
00:56:06,638 --> 00:56:08,731
Yes, this is Mrs. Copeland.

790
00:56:10,508 --> 00:56:14,205
$4,000 dress?
And where did I buy this dress?

791
00:56:14,812 --> 00:56:16,279
The Hamptons!

792
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,815
Yes, I remember.

793
00:56:21,052 --> 00:56:22,383
Thank you.

794
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:27,519
It is on.

795
00:56:32,063 --> 00:56:34,156
I dont see
why I got to go out with Mandingo.

796
00:56:34,232 --> 00:56:36,097
Cause if you dont, youll blow our cover.

797
00:56:36,167 --> 00:56:38,135
What you gonna be doing?

798
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:42,867
Me? Lm going to follow up on a lead.

799
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:49,977
Youre going on a date.

800
00:56:50,048 --> 00:56:51,709
Shes a reporter.

801
00:56:52,383 --> 00:56:55,841
Who else knows more
about the Hamptons people than her?

802
00:56:57,055 --> 00:57:00,821
All right, so I like the girl. Youre the one
always telling me to settle down.

803
00:57:00,892 --> 00:57:02,189
And you should.

804
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:05,423
But that dont mean
I got to go with Buffy the White Girl Slayer.

805
00:57:05,496 --> 00:57:08,397
All right. Look. Just go to dinner. Okay?

806
00:57:08,933 --> 00:57:12,369
Lm only gonna be a couple of hours
and III meet you back at the club.

807
00:57:12,437 --> 00:57:13,734
- You promise?
- I promise?

808
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,329
Lm serious, dude. Promise.

809
00:57:15,406 --> 00:57:17,601
I do. Im serious. All right.

810
00:57:18,743 --> 00:57:20,438
And if you need to use protection...

811
00:57:20,511 --> 00:57:23,878
tell Latrell theres an extra shower curtain
in the bathroom.

812
00:57:33,558 --> 00:57:34,752
Hop in.

813
00:57:36,894 --> 00:57:39,692
Take your time. Watch those marshmallows.

814
00:57:43,201 --> 00:57:45,066
Ease on in there, now.

815
00:57:46,104 --> 00:57:48,732
I wont bite unless you ask me to.

816
00:57:54,479 --> 00:57:56,276
You are so beautiful.

817
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,210
Good boy, Baby.

818
00:58:04,922 --> 00:58:07,914
How about we listen to a little bit of music?

819
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:13,629
What the...

820
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:19,061
How did you know? I love this song!

821
00:58:20,171 --> 00:58:23,072
Making my way downtown
Walking fast

822
00:58:23,141 --> 00:58:25,609
Faces pass
And Im home bound

823
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,738
And I need you

824
00:58:31,682 --> 00:58:33,240
And I miss you

825
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:37,218
And now I wonder

826
00:58:37,688 --> 00:58:42,284
If I could fall
Into the sky

827
00:58:42,627 --> 00:58:47,064
Do you think time
Would pass me by

828
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:52,161
Cause you know Id walk
A thousand miles

829
00:58:52,236 --> 00:58:56,036
If I could
Just see you

830
00:58:57,208 --> 00:58:58,641
Tonight

831
00:59:13,324 --> 00:59:16,191
- Good evening, madam. Welcome to Bella.
- Thank you.

832
00:59:16,894 --> 00:59:17,986
What are you doing here?

833
00:59:18,062 --> 00:59:20,326
I came to borrow the car
and the keys to his house.

834
00:59:20,398 --> 00:59:23,265
Are you crazy? If you crash this mans car,
he will kill you.

835
00:59:23,334 --> 00:59:27,202
I wont crash it. Look. Just call me
before you leave. Ill bring it back.

836
00:59:27,271 --> 00:59:29,705
Then you meet me back at the club.

837
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:33,605
No, my brother. You got to get your own.

838
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:40,078
Help me.

839
00:59:46,524 --> 00:59:48,185
Thank you.

840
00:59:51,162 --> 00:59:53,221
May I bring you something from the bar?

841
00:59:53,297 --> 00:59:56,198
Let me have
a bottle of your best champagne.

842
01:00:00,404 --> 01:00:03,305
- And bring us some oysters.
- Very good, sir.

843
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:06,667
I have to say, I was so...

844
01:00:09,914 --> 01:00:12,439
I was happy
when I bought you at the auction.

845
01:00:12,517 --> 01:00:15,953
I mean, its very rare
I have the opportunity to...

846
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:20,355
bask in the ambience
of such a classy lady such as yourself.

847
01:00:21,759 --> 01:00:23,192
Oh, my God!

848
01:00:23,594 --> 01:00:27,052
- I am humbled by your...
- This athletes foot is just killing me.

849
01:00:27,131 --> 01:00:29,565
...beautiful nature.
- That smell. Thats infection.

850
01:00:29,634 --> 01:00:33,365
- The most high-classness of your...
- My God. Is that a hangnail?

851
01:00:35,072 --> 01:00:37,097
Captivated by your beauty.

852
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:41,000
Your bountiful curves remind me
of the hills in Italy.

853
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:48,345
Im sorry. You were saying?

854
01:00:50,087 --> 01:00:53,181
- Thats perfect. Thank you.
- Are you ready to order?

855
01:00:53,257 --> 01:00:57,284
Yes, III have the chicken. White meat only.

856
01:00:59,664 --> 01:01:02,690
And for the lady, perhaps a salad?

857
01:01:03,901 --> 01:01:08,167
Perhaps not.
Ill have the steak, smothered in onions.

858
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:11,333
A rack of ribs. Pasta with extra garlic.

859
01:01:11,409 --> 01:01:16,278
French fries with lots of vinegar and a
side of onion rings with lots of sauerkraut.

860
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,245
Have you ever had oysters?

861
01:01:24,422 --> 01:01:27,391
Did you know oysters are an aphrodisiac?

862
01:01:34,432 --> 01:01:35,592
Sorry.

863
01:01:37,635 --> 01:01:39,603
My tongues kind of big.

864
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,242
Itll open. Hold it!

865
01:01:52,316 --> 01:01:56,343
III push. Yeah. See, that did it there.

866
01:01:56,887 --> 01:01:58,616
Just a little turn.

867
01:01:59,357 --> 01:02:01,552
Theres so many keys involved...

868
01:02:01,626 --> 01:02:04,754
sometimes its hard to figure out
whats what.

869
01:02:10,134 --> 01:02:12,034
Its Mei Ling.

870
01:02:13,738 --> 01:02:16,104
What are you doing here? Girl, its late!

871
01:02:16,173 --> 01:02:18,641
Come on, now. You have to go home.
Get some rest.

872
01:02:18,709 --> 01:02:22,201
You cannot stay. There are laws
against this kind of workmanship.

873
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,714
Theyll think
lm running some kind of sweatshop.

874
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:28,513
That girl does not know when to go home.

875
01:02:28,586 --> 01:02:33,023
Im telling you, she will stay here
and just clean forever.

876
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:39,054
This is really nice.

877
01:02:39,664 --> 01:02:41,461
Yeah, this is dope.

878
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,198
Dope summer home I picked, boy.

879
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,833
Whos that?

880
01:02:50,875 --> 01:02:55,005
The big, buff, bald dude with the fur?

881
01:02:56,247 --> 01:02:58,078
Thats my trainer.

882
01:02:58,516 --> 01:03:00,074
You have your trainer on your wall?

883
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:04,212
Yes, well, for inspiration.
I want to look like that one day and...

884
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:07,849
I come in every morning
and I look at the... You ever see Titanic?

885
01:03:07,925 --> 01:03:11,918
- No, I havent seen it.
- Me, either. You want something to drink?

886
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:14,996
- Yeah, sure. A glass of wine would be nice.
- Wine.

887
01:03:16,434 --> 01:03:19,801
Okay, so III get you a glass of wine and...

888
01:03:20,604 --> 01:03:22,504
Thatd be in the kitchen, right?

889
01:03:22,573 --> 01:03:25,440
I dont know. This is your house, Latrell.

890
01:03:25,543 --> 01:03:27,909
Who? Oh, me! Latrell.

891
01:03:28,145 --> 01:03:31,080
Thats right. Im Latrell. Thats right.

892
01:03:31,482 --> 01:03:34,849
Im going to get you
a bottle of my wine in my house.

893
01:03:35,319 --> 01:03:39,153
Its my house and I live here

894
01:03:59,777 --> 01:04:01,438
Damn, little lady!

895
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:04,037
You sure can put it away.

896
01:04:07,184 --> 01:04:08,776
Youre so funny.

897
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,382
Voila!

898
01:04:16,761 --> 01:04:18,285
You have a dog.

899
01:04:18,629 --> 01:04:20,824
No, I dont have no damn dog.

900
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:25,794
Well, then whose dog is that?

901
01:04:29,707 --> 01:04:30,799
Shit.

902
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:36,573
Thats not no dog.

903
01:04:37,148 --> 01:04:38,638
Thats family.

904
01:04:40,651 --> 01:04:42,118
Hey, cousin.

905
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:48,615
Come here, boy.

906
01:04:54,131 --> 01:04:56,065
He looks really mad! Are you okay?

907
01:04:56,133 --> 01:04:59,398
Yeah, lm fine. He just misses me, thats all.

908
01:04:59,603 --> 01:05:02,834
Okay, boy, playtimes over. Let me up!

909
01:05:04,475 --> 01:05:07,876
- You want me to go for help?
- No, were just having fun.

910
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:10,038
You sure are playful today.

911
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:14,881
You want to go for a walk, boy?

912
01:05:16,253 --> 01:05:17,982
III be right back!

913
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:21,557
You know what?
Forget this! Lm out of here!

914
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:25,584
I dont want to go on a date with a guy
and his dog is biting him and...

915
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:35,070
Whats he doing now? Whats that?

916
01:05:36,207 --> 01:05:37,799
Dont pay him no mind.

917
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:41,038
Hes just going to do that
until he falls asleep.

918
01:05:43,514 --> 01:05:46,312
Now, where were we? Wine!

919
01:05:57,428 --> 01:06:01,592
You know,
I like a woman with a little extra something.

920
01:06:03,267 --> 01:06:06,464
A little cushion for the pushing.

921
01:06:07,404 --> 01:06:10,271
Id really love for you
to come to one of my games.

922
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:13,970
No, thank you. Ive seen you play.
Not impressed.

923
01:06:14,211 --> 01:06:17,772
Excuse me? Lm the highest scoring forward
in the league!

924
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:23,483
But all that talent? Totally overshadowed by
nothing but scandals and pure laziness.

925
01:06:23,554 --> 01:06:27,513
Come on! Youre shooting under 50%%
from the free throw line, okay?

926
01:06:27,591 --> 01:06:29,354
Your turnover ratio, abysmal.

927
01:06:29,426 --> 01:06:33,692
And on top of that, you cant shoot
three-pointers to save your life. So...

928
01:06:33,764 --> 01:06:35,129
squeeze me.

929
01:06:44,108 --> 01:06:46,702
No ones ever cared like that before.

930
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:50,138
Come here, baby!

931
01:06:56,921 --> 01:06:58,513
Oopsie! I had a poopsie.

932
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:03,223
Girl, were going to get along just fine.

933
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:05,460
Back at you!

934
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:11,734
- Bask in the ambience!
- Im going to be sick.

935
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:17,206
So, no. I jump over the fence, fall.
I scrape my knee.

936
01:07:17,274 --> 01:07:19,504
- Get out of here.
- No, seriously, listen.

937
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:23,980
I scrape my knee. I get chased by the cops
and I spend the night in jail.

938
01:07:24,048 --> 01:07:27,313
Thats insane. You did all that
just to find J-Lo and Bens hideaway?

939
01:07:27,384 --> 01:07:31,445
I cant help it. You know,
investigative journalism is my passion.

940
01:07:31,655 --> 01:07:35,352
So howd you end up
writing puff pieces for the local news?

941
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:39,254
Unfortunately, I made some enemies...

942
01:07:39,763 --> 01:07:42,288
and ended up getting fired from my last job.

943
01:07:42,366 --> 01:07:43,390
What happened?

944
01:07:43,467 --> 01:07:45,560
Believe me,
you dont want to know about that.

945
01:07:45,636 --> 01:07:48,628
Look, I spent all night talking about myself.

946
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:52,735
Sometimes its good for a man
to just sit back and listen.

947
01:07:53,911 --> 01:07:56,243
Well, since you put it that way.

948
01:07:59,516 --> 01:08:02,144
I did this piece on Warren Vandergeld.

949
01:08:02,553 --> 01:08:05,454
Him and his partners tried to swindle a guy.

950
01:08:05,522 --> 01:08:07,717
You talking about Ted Burton?

951
01:08:08,258 --> 01:08:10,021
Yeah, how did you know that?

952
01:08:10,094 --> 01:08:12,688
It was in the paper. I read about it.

953
01:08:13,797 --> 01:08:15,788
But what they didnt report in the paper...

954
01:08:15,866 --> 01:08:18,892
was that Burton was 10 times smarter
than all of them.

955
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:22,700
He embezzled millions
and stashed it in an offshore account.

956
01:08:25,175 --> 01:08:27,575
When Vandergeld heard the story
was going to break...

957
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,738
he didnt want to be embarrassed.

958
01:08:29,813 --> 01:08:31,781
Well, there goes my job.

959
01:08:33,951 --> 01:08:35,942
You know, youre a good listener.

960
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:39,114
It seems like you have the whole package.

961
01:08:56,874 --> 01:08:57,932
Man!

962
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,605
- Hello?
- Kev, you got to go.

963
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:06,707
- What? Now?
- Yeah, now. Were on our way.

964
01:09:07,718 --> 01:09:09,743
Cant you stall him for a little while?

965
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:13,312
Look, this man sang to me.
He tried to kiss me and on top of that...

966
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:15,449
he been farting for the last 20 minutes.

967
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:18,359
All right, III be there in a minute. Bye.

968
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:22,323
- Cottontail!
- Im coming, nigger!

969
01:09:25,769 --> 01:09:27,930
Gomez, what the hell are we looking for?

970
01:09:28,005 --> 01:09:31,634
I dont know. Something just isnt right
about these girls.

971
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,904
Im gonna check the bathroom.

972
01:09:44,688 --> 01:09:46,178
Find anything?

973
01:09:47,324 --> 01:09:49,758
No. Not yet.

974
01:09:58,535 --> 01:10:02,471
You wont believe what I...
What the hell are you doing?

975
01:10:06,677 --> 01:10:10,443
Sniffing chicks underwear, man.
What is the big...

976
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:12,238
Its... What?

977
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:19,817
Theyre guys, arent they?

978
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,783
You really are disgusting.

979
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:41,708
- Latrell, my man! Whats going on, brother?
- Whats up, man?

980
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:45,380
- Two apple martinis.
- You hitting that, bro?

981
01:10:46,016 --> 01:10:48,644
- This is a tough one to crack.
- Tiffany Wilson?

982
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:50,710
She puts the E in easy.

983
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:53,814
Here. Drop a couple of these babies
in her drink, man.

984
01:10:53,891 --> 01:10:55,688
Are you sure this will work?

985
01:10:55,759 --> 01:10:58,387
Man, I just took two of them,
and lm telling you...

986
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:01,158
Im boinking someone tonight, you know?

987
01:11:02,132 --> 01:11:03,463
Excuse me.

988
01:11:10,107 --> 01:11:12,803
Thats for you, my little Miracle Whip.

989
01:11:13,677 --> 01:11:16,305
You need to loosen up. There you go.

990
01:11:17,948 --> 01:11:19,210
Thats for you.

991
01:11:19,283 --> 01:11:21,615
- Oh, my God! Is that Britney Spears?
- Where?

992
01:11:21,685 --> 01:11:25,177
Right over there. Forget it, she just left.

993
01:11:26,723 --> 01:11:28,748
Oops, she did it again.

994
01:11:33,697 --> 01:11:35,892
- Lets drink up.
- Lets do it.

995
01:11:36,767 --> 01:11:38,394
To the last drop.

996
01:11:44,741 --> 01:11:47,539
Thats good. You want to dance?

997
01:11:47,744 --> 01:11:51,703
You know, thats a great idea.
Here, hold Baby. Lets go, girls.

998
01:12:00,824 --> 01:12:05,761
I found out some interesting information.
Ted Burton turned the tables on Vandergeld.

999
01:12:05,829 --> 01:12:07,524
Tucked away $100 million.

1000
01:12:07,598 --> 01:12:10,431
Been living the high life
ever since he got out of prison.

1001
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,365
There goes our motive.

1002
01:12:22,145 --> 01:12:24,579
Those skanks think theyre hot?

1003
01:12:26,617 --> 01:12:29,142
Lets show them what sexy really is.

1004
01:12:55,178 --> 01:12:58,011
They want to battle. Lets go, girls.

1005
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:15,723
You girls want some of this?

1006
01:13:15,799 --> 01:13:17,994
Bring it on, sisters!

1007
01:13:18,135 --> 01:13:20,194
Okay, lets do it!

1008
01:13:21,038 --> 01:13:23,404
Five, six, seven, eight.

1009
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:28,899
Come on.

1010
01:14:32,209 --> 01:14:33,904
Hold on.

1011
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:37,745
I know you hookers
dont think this is over with.

1012
01:14:38,782 --> 01:14:40,773
Lets kick it old school.

1013
01:15:05,008 --> 01:15:06,339
They suck!

1014
01:15:39,342 --> 01:15:40,866
Oh, my God!

1015
01:15:50,287 --> 01:15:51,584
We won!

1016
01:16:02,466 --> 01:16:04,127
Come on, lets go.

1017
01:16:05,569 --> 01:16:07,662
Get out of my way! Move it!

1018
01:16:09,406 --> 01:16:10,930
I need a drink.

1019
01:16:16,713 --> 01:16:19,511
Hey, Latrell, my man.

1020
01:16:21,284 --> 01:16:23,115
So did it work, man?

1021
01:16:24,821 --> 01:16:26,311
I dont know.

1022
01:16:27,424 --> 01:16:29,153
But I got to dance.

1023
01:16:29,926 --> 01:16:31,587
I got to hit this.

1024
01:16:34,297 --> 01:16:35,764
Hold the dog.

1025
01:16:41,304 --> 01:16:41,338
Let it out.

1026
01:16:41,338 --> 01:16:42,669
Let it out.

1027
01:16:43,073 --> 01:16:45,007
Oh, yeah. Now its out.

1028
01:16:46,176 --> 01:16:48,804
I paid thousands of dollars on this outfit...

1029
01:16:48,879 --> 01:16:51,313
and do you think he even noticed?

1030
01:16:51,381 --> 01:16:52,541
Its going to be okay.

1031
01:16:52,616 --> 01:16:54,948
Little Miss Vandergeld walks in...

1032
01:16:55,018 --> 01:16:58,078
and he just forgets all about me.

1033
01:16:59,656 --> 01:17:01,920
Okay, let it out.

1034
01:17:03,593 --> 01:17:04,958
I wonder...

1035
01:17:06,563 --> 01:17:09,054
if he would think she was so hot...

1036
01:17:09,566 --> 01:17:13,866
if he knew that she is broke.

1037
01:17:14,971 --> 01:17:16,700
Vandergelds broke?

1038
01:17:19,643 --> 01:17:22,544
We mustnt talk of such things.

1039
01:17:22,646 --> 01:17:24,113
No, we wont.

1040
01:17:24,814 --> 01:17:27,681
But, yes, theyre broke.

1041
01:17:29,886 --> 01:17:34,346
My father even had to
loan her father money...

1042
01:17:34,491 --> 01:17:37,289
just so that they could keep their house.

1043
01:17:37,427 --> 01:17:40,021
They just paid us back.

1044
01:17:41,398 --> 01:17:44,629
- You guys, I love you guys.
- We love you, too.

1045
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:46,430
I love you so much!

1046
01:17:47,804 --> 01:17:49,135
Thank you.

1047
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:52,004
Can we get you some gum
or a mint or something?

1048
01:17:53,009 --> 01:17:54,636
Hey, little girl.

1049
01:17:59,182 --> 01:18:02,276
Really? I love you, too.

1050
01:18:06,256 --> 01:18:09,054
What the hell are you doing? Give me her!

1051
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:13,128
Sicko. Wheres Latrell?

1052
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:15,296
Dance floor.

1053
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:54,570
Good morning, snowflake.

1054
01:19:02,779 --> 01:19:04,246
Oh, my God. Brittany!

1055
01:19:05,415 --> 01:19:07,713
- What?
- Were on page six.

1056
01:19:08,151 --> 01:19:09,743
- No.
- Yeah.

1057
01:19:09,819 --> 01:19:13,414
Look. Wilson sisters rock Hamptons.

1058
01:19:17,227 --> 01:19:19,991
- Wilsons rock!
- We rocked!

1059
01:19:21,931 --> 01:19:25,924
Wait. We werent in the Hamptons
this weekend.

1060
01:19:27,103 --> 01:19:31,369
No! Weve been cloned!

1061
01:19:35,945 --> 01:19:38,539
Hes got to be around here somewhere.

1062
01:19:38,682 --> 01:19:41,947
Girl, wait a minute.
Isnt that Marcus right there?

1063
01:19:42,585 --> 01:19:46,316
- Thats him, all right. Old lying dog!
- Caught you.

1064
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:50,858
That sounds like Gina.

1065
01:19:51,895 --> 01:19:54,125
- Dont answer it. Shell go away.
- No, she wont.

1066
01:19:54,197 --> 01:19:57,189
Im not going anywhere
until you open this door!

1067
01:19:57,267 --> 01:20:00,862
- I told you! What am I going to do?
- Just get rid of her.

1068
01:20:01,471 --> 01:20:04,201
Ill get rid of her. You hide the stuff.

1069
01:20:06,376 --> 01:20:10,039
- Im not playing with you!
- Coming, baby!

1070
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:12,280
What is all that noise?

1071
01:20:12,515 --> 01:20:14,813
Nothing! Okay, baby, lm coming!

1072
01:20:19,422 --> 01:20:21,549
Lm coming. Hide.

1073
01:20:25,295 --> 01:20:28,526
Hey, baby! Hi, boo-boo.

1074
01:20:33,269 --> 01:20:36,568
- Nice room you got, Marcus.
- Hey, baby, what you doing here?

1075
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:39,005
- I could ask you the same question.
- Me?

1076
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:41,370
Lm on assignment.

1077
01:20:42,078 --> 01:20:44,069
Are you wearing lipstick?

1078
01:20:45,281 --> 01:20:47,476
No. Thats Kool-Aid. You want some?

1079
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:50,986
You know, its filled with lots of
vitamin C and riboflavin.

1080
01:20:51,054 --> 01:20:52,544
Is that a bra?

1081
01:20:53,456 --> 01:20:54,718
No, this?

1082
01:20:55,091 --> 01:20:58,959
This is the new holsters
they gave us at work.

1083
01:20:59,028 --> 01:21:02,520
Theyre government issue.
You can put two guns in there and just...

1084
01:21:02,599 --> 01:21:04,089
Freeze, FBI!

1085
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:07,737
- I know somebodys in here.
- Baby, nobodys in here.

1086
01:21:07,804 --> 01:21:10,671
See? Nobodys in here.

1087
01:21:11,975 --> 01:21:14,944
- Check under the bed...
- What do you mean, Check under the bed?

1088
01:21:15,011 --> 01:21:18,174
- I heard somebody on the phone.
- Check under the bed!

1089
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:21,547
- Thats where everybody hides! Check it!
- Marcus! Nobody can fit!

1090
01:21:21,618 --> 01:21:23,745
See, nobody here, right? Nobody there.

1091
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:27,415
- Ill look in the bathroom.
- Wait! No! Dont check the bathroom!

1092
01:21:29,359 --> 01:21:31,759
You dont want me to check the bathroom!

1093
01:21:34,264 --> 01:21:37,700
See? Nothing in the bathroom.
Nobody in the room. See?

1094
01:21:38,067 --> 01:21:40,399
I told you no one was here. See?

1095
01:21:41,905 --> 01:21:44,066
You know, baby, this gotta stop!

1096
01:21:44,174 --> 01:21:47,075
- We cant have love if we dont have trust.
- I know, but look.

1097
01:21:47,143 --> 01:21:49,771
I was at the restaurant and the card
wouldnt go through...

1098
01:21:49,846 --> 01:21:53,873
Listen. If we dont have trust,
we dont have nothing.

1099
01:21:54,317 --> 01:21:56,717
This is not about trust. This is about...

1100
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:01,314
There she is, right there!

1101
01:22:06,362 --> 01:22:08,557
Now, baby. I can explain.

1102
01:22:09,432 --> 01:22:11,730
- I knew it.
- Baby, its not what you think.

1103
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:15,202
- Baby, its not what you think.
- Dont you even say nothing to me!

1104
01:22:15,705 --> 01:22:18,697
I can explain. Baby, its not what you think.

1105
01:22:19,976 --> 01:22:21,341
Hes a man!

1106
01:22:21,678 --> 01:22:23,077
Youre sick!

1107
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:26,516
We have to find them and stop them
before they execute their evil plan.

1108
01:22:26,516 --> 01:22:30,043
We have to find them and stop them
before they execute their evil plan.

1109
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:32,610
- Wait, what do they look like?
- Duh, us!

1110
01:22:32,689 --> 01:22:34,782
Afternoon, ladies.

1111
01:22:34,891 --> 01:22:37,121
The Chief would like
to have a word with you.

1112
01:22:37,193 --> 01:22:40,094
My God, Tiffany. Theyre the Men in Black.

1113
01:22:40,797 --> 01:22:41,821
Come on.

1114
01:22:42,232 --> 01:22:45,360
- Easy, Ponch and Jon. My hair!
- Lets move it along, pal.

1115
01:22:45,435 --> 01:22:47,027
- Wait a minute!
- Lets go!

1116
01:22:47,103 --> 01:22:51,597
Chief, we just got confirmation
that Burtons arrived at JFK.

1117
01:22:51,808 --> 01:22:55,710
I want him trailed. Give him plenty of room.
I dont want anyone jumping the gun.

1118
01:22:55,778 --> 01:22:57,905
I want to get this guy red-handed.

1119
01:22:58,214 --> 01:23:00,705
- Get your hands off of me!
- Lets go.

1120
01:23:01,217 --> 01:23:03,344
- Hey, easy!
- Right this way, girls.

1121
01:23:04,787 --> 01:23:07,449
What the hell you guys doing
with the Wilson sisters?

1122
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:11,392
- Chief, these arent the Wilson sisters.
- No, sir.

1123
01:23:12,228 --> 01:23:14,389
Chief, check this out.

1124
01:23:16,766 --> 01:23:18,427
My God! What are you doing?

1125
01:23:18,501 --> 01:23:21,129
- Thats on there pretty good.
- Let her go.

1126
01:23:21,204 --> 01:23:23,104
Thats nothing, Chief.

1127
01:23:24,874 --> 01:23:26,341
How about...

1128
01:23:30,213 --> 01:23:33,114
- Those are nice.
- Thats enough!

1129
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:36,775
I dont know how he did that...

1130
01:23:37,153 --> 01:23:39,280
but you cant fake these.

1131
01:23:53,536 --> 01:23:57,768
My God! Look whos here.
Its that beautiful...

1132
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,068
Save it!

1133
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:04,002
Because of you, I had to suspend
two of my best agents!

1134
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,174
- Chief, I can explain.
- I dont want to hear it!

1135
01:24:07,283 --> 01:24:10,047
Youre just lucky we caught Burton
before he could strike.

1136
01:24:10,119 --> 01:24:12,280
But Burton is not our guy!

1137
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:14,921
Let me guess: Womens intuition?

1138
01:24:15,825 --> 01:24:16,951
Youre both fired.

1139
01:24:17,026 --> 01:24:19,688
Turn in your guns and your badges.
This operation is over!

1140
01:24:19,762 --> 01:24:22,856
- Come on, Chief! You cant fire us.
- I just did.

1141
01:24:26,636 --> 01:24:29,104
Forget him, Marcus. We can do this ourself.

1142
01:24:29,172 --> 01:24:31,663
- Look, all we got to do is...
- Wait.

1143
01:24:32,408 --> 01:24:34,899
We? Kevin, this aint about we.

1144
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:37,640
Its never been. Its about you.

1145
01:24:37,714 --> 01:24:41,206
You come up with some stupid idea
and lm dumb enough to go along with it.

1146
01:24:41,284 --> 01:24:43,115
And look where its gotten me, Kevin.

1147
01:24:43,186 --> 01:24:46,178
I just lost my wife and my job
because of you.

1148
01:24:46,255 --> 01:24:49,315
So dont tell me about we no more,
all right?

1149
01:24:51,527 --> 01:24:54,155
They bought it. The FBI is packing up.

1150
01:24:54,664 --> 01:24:57,633
Theyll be out of our hair in a couple hours.

1151
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,998
We could make the grab tonight.

1152
01:25:00,103 --> 01:25:03,300
You sure you and your friend
can get the job done?

1153
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:08,002
Would I let you down, Mr. V?

1154
01:25:12,949 --> 01:25:16,942
- Hey, man. I just want to say sorry.
- Forget about it, dude.

1155
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:21,286
No. Youre right. Youre absolutely right.
Ive been selfish.

1156
01:25:21,357 --> 01:25:26,192
Im always dragging you into everything.
I never even asked what you want to do.

1157
01:25:26,596 --> 01:25:30,191
I dont know, theres something about
always having you around, that just...

1158
01:25:30,266 --> 01:25:32,666
makes me want to step up my game.

1159
01:25:32,902 --> 01:25:36,702
I guess its because I always know
youre gonna have my back.

1160
01:25:40,209 --> 01:25:41,369
Hello?

1161
01:25:43,046 --> 01:25:44,240
Thanks.

1162
01:25:46,949 --> 01:25:48,849
- Who was that?
- That was Josh.

1163
01:25:48,918 --> 01:25:52,877
Turns out that Vandergelds prints
was all over the ransom note.

1164
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:55,890
- What are you doing?
- Calling the Chief.

1165
01:25:55,958 --> 01:25:59,155
No, you aint! You said we could do this
on our own, right?

1166
01:25:59,228 --> 01:26:00,695
What about backup?

1167
01:26:00,763 --> 01:26:03,755
I got you, you got me.
Thats all the backup we need.

1168
01:26:03,833 --> 01:26:05,960
Triple T-K-A.

1169
01:26:06,335 --> 01:26:09,532
Time to totally kick ass!

1170
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:21,614
Three generations at the Bureau
and lm the first to get fired.

1171
01:26:22,318 --> 01:26:24,411
My dad is going to kill me!

1172
01:26:25,555 --> 01:26:27,386
Yeah? What? Who?

1173
01:26:29,392 --> 01:26:32,884
- Copeland!
- Copeland, you dick!

1174
01:26:33,429 --> 01:26:35,920
Youve got a lot of nerve, calling.

1175
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:37,192
Where?

1176
01:26:39,402 --> 01:26:42,462
- You better not be wrong about this.
- What?

1177
01:26:42,538 --> 01:26:45,701
- We might be getting our jobs back.
- What are you talking about?

1178
01:26:45,775 --> 01:26:48,573
- We gotta go.
- What do you mean, go?

1179
01:26:48,911 --> 01:26:51,709
How about this?
RuPaul or Whoopi Goldberg?

1180
01:26:52,949 --> 01:26:55,543
- I told you, lm not playing your games.
- Come on!

1181
01:27:13,436 --> 01:27:15,961
- Any sign of Vandergeld?
- I dont see him.

1182
01:27:16,038 --> 01:27:18,097
All right, keep an eye out for him.

1183
01:27:18,174 --> 01:27:20,369
If its going down,
its going to go down here.

1184
01:27:20,443 --> 01:27:23,003
Thank God! There you are! I did it.

1185
01:27:23,312 --> 01:27:26,770
- You did what?
- I got you into the fashion show!

1186
01:27:27,483 --> 01:27:32,113
Brittany, did you hear that?
Were in the fashion show.

1187
01:27:32,522 --> 01:27:35,150
Not if we dont get moving.
Come on, lets go!

1188
01:27:35,224 --> 01:27:39,285
- Get the lead out, ladies.
- I mean, its like you forgot.

1189
01:27:42,064 --> 01:27:44,555
- You mean the Wilson sisters are in?
- And were out?

1190
01:27:44,634 --> 01:27:48,934
Lm sorry. Thats just the way it is.
Theyre hot, youre not! So deal with it.

1191
01:27:49,005 --> 01:27:51,872
- You! Straighten up that blouse, now!
- Thats impossible!

1192
01:27:51,941 --> 01:27:55,843
Weve been on that catwalk every summer
for six years straight!

1193
01:27:56,245 --> 01:27:58,372
Lets just cut to the chase.

1194
01:27:58,781 --> 01:28:02,842
Who do we have to sleep with
for us to get in the show?

1195
01:28:03,219 --> 01:28:06,484
Honey, youre so
barking up the wrong tree right now. Really!

1196
01:28:06,556 --> 01:28:09,491
If you nail this, youre a shoo-in
for the cover of Hamptons.

1197
01:28:09,559 --> 01:28:11,993
Darlings! Where have you been?

1198
01:28:12,962 --> 01:28:14,429
Megan! Dont!

1199
01:28:15,097 --> 01:28:16,894
This is unacceptable.

1200
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,228
They just messed with the wrong girls!

1201
01:28:21,204 --> 01:28:23,195
Lve been looking everywhere for you.

1202
01:28:23,272 --> 01:28:27,231
Can we get the Wilson sisters
their outfits now, please? Go.

1203
01:28:32,181 --> 01:28:34,775
- Can we talk?
- Of course.

1204
01:28:35,918 --> 01:28:38,250
You were incredible at the nightclub
last night.

1205
01:28:38,321 --> 01:28:40,482
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Incredible.

1206
01:28:40,556 --> 01:28:44,253
And Heather will be leaving after the party
tonight, and I was thinking...

1207
01:28:44,327 --> 01:28:47,387
maybe you could come by around 2:00?

1208
01:28:48,598 --> 01:28:50,327
Make that 3:00 a.m.

1209
01:28:58,641 --> 01:29:00,131
You know what?

1210
01:29:01,377 --> 01:29:03,004
I dont think so.

1211
01:29:03,179 --> 01:29:04,510
Excuse me?

1212
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:07,213
You think lm just a booty call.

1213
01:29:07,917 --> 01:29:09,407
Well, lm not.

1214
01:29:10,953 --> 01:29:13,046
I deserve better than that.

1215
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:16,522
Im tired of being your doormat.

1216
01:29:21,931 --> 01:29:23,159
Honey...

1217
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:27,298
what makes you think youre that special?

1218
01:29:30,606 --> 01:29:32,733
- Bastard.
- Excuse me.

1219
01:29:33,776 --> 01:29:35,004
Asswipe!

1220
01:29:42,385 --> 01:29:45,320
- Youre going to regret that.
- Im so scared.

1221
01:29:46,489 --> 01:29:48,548
Oh, my God! Tiffany!

1222
01:29:49,892 --> 01:29:53,828
- Thank you so much, honey.
- I am so proud of you.

1223
01:29:53,963 --> 01:29:57,126
Thanks. I just wish I didnt feel so crappy.

1224
01:29:57,967 --> 01:29:59,161
Honey.

1225
01:29:59,902 --> 01:30:03,201
Sometimes a man cant see
when he has someone so special...

1226
01:30:03,272 --> 01:30:05,502
sitting right in front of him.

1227
01:30:06,175 --> 01:30:08,666
Are you, like, a lesbian?

1228
01:30:12,415 --> 01:30:14,747
- I better go get changed.
- Okay.

1229
01:30:15,985 --> 01:30:19,113
Ladies and gentlemen,
this evening we are proud to present...

1230
01:30:19,188 --> 01:30:23,386
the fall couture line, Aubrey Allure.
Please take your seats.

1231
01:30:25,061 --> 01:30:26,961
- Excuse me?
- Youre not on the list.

1232
01:30:27,029 --> 01:30:30,192
Invitation, my ass!
They dont know how we do it.

1233
01:30:31,167 --> 01:30:33,362
- Lets just blend.
- All right.

1234
01:30:52,154 --> 01:30:54,281
Go! Get going! Move it!

1235
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:03,758
Didnt we just have this conversation?

1236
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:07,268
Can we get these fantastic supermodels...

1237
01:31:07,336 --> 01:31:10,305
- back into their dressing rooms?
- I cant believe it!

1238
01:31:44,974 --> 01:31:47,408
- They changed that quick!
- Amazing!

1239
01:31:56,685 --> 01:31:59,518
These ought to get the critics attention.

1240
01:32:33,089 --> 01:32:36,149
Second changes, everybody! Go! Now!

1241
01:32:37,159 --> 01:32:39,457
Thisll be a nice little treat.

1242
01:33:04,453 --> 01:33:06,182
My God! Whats happening?

1243
01:33:07,756 --> 01:33:09,348
Thats not mine!

1244
01:33:10,226 --> 01:33:11,818
Lets get out of here!

1245
01:33:12,094 --> 01:33:13,356
Lm sorry!

1246
01:33:19,435 --> 01:33:22,063
Just give me your hand. Itll be okay.

1247
01:33:25,374 --> 01:33:27,365
Im so sorry. Oh!

1248
01:33:28,410 --> 01:33:30,207
Come here! I got you!

1249
01:33:32,681 --> 01:33:34,205
Here we go. Up!

1250
01:33:37,086 --> 01:33:38,815
- My God!
- I hope shes okay.

1251
01:33:38,888 --> 01:33:40,253
Im ruined.

1252
01:33:45,127 --> 01:33:49,291
Looks like some people just dont know
when to quit. Come on, girls.

1253
01:33:50,866 --> 01:33:52,959
- Help me.
- I got you.

1254
01:33:57,740 --> 01:33:59,901
Karen, what are you doing?

1255
01:33:59,975 --> 01:34:03,911
Look, someone has got to give those girls
a taste of their own medicine.

1256
01:34:24,466 --> 01:34:28,493
So revolutionary! Its so bold and so...

1257
01:34:29,438 --> 01:34:30,905
So brilliant!

1258
01:34:56,065 --> 01:34:58,499
Everybody, theyre imposters!

1259
01:35:02,972 --> 01:35:04,496
Hit the lights.

1260
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:30,892
Wheres Brittany?

1261
01:35:35,804 --> 01:35:37,294
Where are you?

1262
01:35:53,656 --> 01:35:54,918
Get down!

1263
01:36:01,463 --> 01:36:04,159
I told you you were going to regret it.

1264
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:07,394
You hit like a bitch! Come on.

1265
01:36:08,904 --> 01:36:11,702
You run and III shoot you. Come on.

1266
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:27,281
- My turn.
- Mama?

1267
01:36:29,958 --> 01:36:32,119
Girl, we going to need some backup.

1268
01:36:33,929 --> 01:36:35,419
Girl, call NayNay and LaQuanda.

1269
01:36:35,497 --> 01:36:38,022
Tell them to bring the Vaseline
and the straight razors.

1270
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:39,692
These bitches are on some other shit!

1271
01:36:39,768 --> 01:36:41,360
Whats going on?

1272
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:44,637
- Dont touch my dress!
- Vandergelds got Tiffany!

1273
01:36:44,707 --> 01:36:48,143
What? No one messes with my queen!

1274
01:36:48,277 --> 01:36:50,074
Marcus! Are you okay?

1275
01:36:50,646 --> 01:36:52,375
- No.
- Whats wrong?

1276
01:36:52,981 --> 01:36:55,506
These damn G-strings are killing me!

1277
01:36:59,088 --> 01:37:01,181
- Freeze!
- FBI.

1278
01:37:02,925 --> 01:37:05,723
You guys take care of them.
Were going after Vandergeld.

1279
01:37:05,794 --> 01:37:08,319
Copeland! Youre going to need this.

1280
01:37:09,865 --> 01:37:11,526
Come on, lets go.

1281
01:37:13,602 --> 01:37:15,194
FBI! Freeze!

1282
01:37:18,107 --> 01:37:19,734
Daddy, what are you doing?

1283
01:37:19,808 --> 01:37:23,073
Why dont you take your mother
and your sister and go on home?

1284
01:37:23,145 --> 01:37:25,375
Daddy, why are you doing this?

1285
01:37:25,447 --> 01:37:27,938
Daddy didnt tell you? Hes broke.

1286
01:37:28,016 --> 01:37:29,847
What do you mean, broke?

1287
01:37:29,918 --> 01:37:32,853
Like Martha Stewart broke
or MC Hammer broke?

1288
01:37:33,188 --> 01:37:35,952
- MC Hammer broke!
- No!

1289
01:37:36,358 --> 01:37:41,159
Lve been funneling money out of the charity
into a private account, just to get us by!

1290
01:37:43,866 --> 01:37:45,834
Are you filming this?

1291
01:37:47,102 --> 01:37:49,502
III give you something to shoot!

1292
01:37:51,407 --> 01:37:53,932
- Get out of my way!
- I cant do that.

1293
01:37:58,680 --> 01:37:59,908
Drop it!

1294
01:38:04,586 --> 01:38:07,612
I got you, man. Man, well get that stain out.
Dont even worry.

1295
01:38:07,689 --> 01:38:09,054
Dont move!

1296
01:38:09,625 --> 01:38:12,355
Warren Vandergeld, you are under arrest!

1297
01:38:14,530 --> 01:38:18,796
I just want to tell you, I appreciate
what you did. That was real brave of you.

1298
01:38:18,867 --> 01:38:23,804
I had no choice. I couldnt let them take
my one true love away.

1299
01:38:25,741 --> 01:38:28,869
Hey, dude. Im not what you think I am.

1300
01:38:30,579 --> 01:38:34,208
Baby, we all got secrets. Thats okay.

1301
01:38:40,689 --> 01:38:45,353
Are you telling me that you are not...

1302
01:38:45,461 --> 01:38:47,691
- Yeah. Im not a woman.
- White?

1303
01:38:48,497 --> 01:38:52,228
The deception! The betrayal, man!
You deceived me!

1304
01:38:52,301 --> 01:38:54,792
Calm down. Im an FBI agent.
I was uncovering a...

1305
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:56,360
Negro, please!

1306
01:38:57,239 --> 01:39:00,333
Didnt somebody tell you
this was an all-white party?

1307
01:39:00,409 --> 01:39:03,037
Someone get this jigaboo away from me!

1308
01:39:03,278 --> 01:39:04,745
Are you okay?

1309
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:07,275
Yes, lm fine. Thank you.

1310
01:39:07,649 --> 01:39:10,709
So, do I get to see my knight
in shining armor?

1311
01:39:11,086 --> 01:39:12,849
- Well...
- Get a leg!

1312
01:39:14,323 --> 01:39:15,688
Get off me!

1313
01:39:15,858 --> 01:39:18,122
What do you mean?
Lm going to let you have it!

1314
01:39:18,193 --> 01:39:20,354
- You aint never met nobody like me!
- Its me!

1315
01:39:20,429 --> 01:39:23,421
You dont know who you messing with!
My names Gina!

1316
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:24,727
Its me.

1317
01:39:32,307 --> 01:39:34,798
This is some Jerry Springer shit!

1318
01:39:37,212 --> 01:39:41,911
Once again, you guys managed to do
everything I told you not to do.

1319
01:39:42,618 --> 01:39:46,019
You caused over $250,000 worth of damage.

1320
01:39:46,288 --> 01:39:48,085
Two people were shot.

1321
01:39:49,658 --> 01:39:53,458
But at least you got the right guy.

1322
01:39:53,829 --> 01:39:56,195
- Good work.
- Thanks a lot, Chief.

1323
01:39:56,265 --> 01:39:58,790
But we couldnt have done it
without Gomez and Harper.

1324
01:39:58,867 --> 01:40:02,166
All right,
III see you all in the office tomorrow.

1325
01:40:03,305 --> 01:40:04,897
Good work, guys.

1326
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:09,344
Who will be featured
on the cover of Hamptons Magazine?

1327
01:40:09,411 --> 01:40:12,005
I have to take care of some business.

1328
01:40:12,214 --> 01:40:14,079
See you guys on Monday.

1329
01:40:14,149 --> 01:40:17,516
So, who do you think wore those panties
you were sniffing?

1330
01:40:17,586 --> 01:40:19,178
Kevin or Marcus?

1331
01:40:19,421 --> 01:40:22,913
- Gomez, I told you. I was looking for DNA.
- Oh, yeah.

1332
01:40:24,459 --> 01:40:26,859
What are you laughing at, Denzel?

1333
01:40:26,929 --> 01:40:29,523
Oh, what a beautiful chocolate man!

1334
01:40:31,466 --> 01:40:33,024
You guys got some work to do?

1335
01:40:33,101 --> 01:40:35,331
Lm Denise Porter. Good night.

1336
01:40:41,643 --> 01:40:44,874
Im Kevin Copeland. Im an FBI agent.

1337
01:40:46,515 --> 01:40:49,006
I make $30,000 a year after taxes.

1338
01:40:49,318 --> 01:40:53,015
I dont drive a Bentley
and I dont have a house on a hill.

1339
01:40:53,522 --> 01:40:56,082
But Id really like to take you out.

1340
01:40:57,159 --> 01:41:00,287
Are you kidding me? Any man...

1341
01:41:02,464 --> 01:41:05,456
who would jump in front of a bullet for me...

1342
01:41:06,368 --> 01:41:08,768
can definitely take me on a date.

1343
01:41:14,109 --> 01:41:16,577
- Come on, girl, lets go.
- Wait, could I just please...

1344
01:41:16,645 --> 01:41:20,672
- I have nothing more to say to you.
- I know. Just listen to me, please.

1345
01:41:20,782 --> 01:41:22,647
Gina, I lied to you.

1346
01:41:23,452 --> 01:41:25,443
Ive hid things from you.

1347
01:41:25,721 --> 01:41:29,248
But I have never cheated on you.
But I am guilty.

1348
01:41:30,492 --> 01:41:33,950
Im guilty of paying more attention
to my job than I do my wife.

1349
01:41:34,029 --> 01:41:37,396
Im guilty of not appreciating
all the little things you do for me.

1350
01:41:37,466 --> 01:41:39,593
Like getting your hair done.

1351
01:41:40,602 --> 01:41:44,231
Wearing that sweet-smelling Chanel
cologne I love so much.

1352
01:41:44,373 --> 01:41:49,242
But my biggest crime is that
I didnt tell you I loved you every single day.

1353
01:41:50,545 --> 01:41:54,379
- Youre not going to let him off that easy.
- Will you shut up?

1354
01:41:58,520 --> 01:41:59,885
I love you.

1355
01:42:07,262 --> 01:42:08,422
A wheelchair?

1356
01:42:08,497 --> 01:42:11,694
Yes, but the feeling will come back,
I promise.

1357
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:14,835
Making my way downtown
Walking fast

1358
01:42:14,903 --> 01:42:16,996
Faces pass
And Im home bound

1359
01:42:17,072 --> 01:42:18,539
Backup, Tony.

1360
01:42:19,641 --> 01:42:21,302
Hey, girls.

1361
01:42:25,414 --> 01:42:29,714
So you guys were pretending to be them
the entire time?

1362
01:42:29,785 --> 01:42:32,686
Yes, we were.
But we was only doing our job.

1363
01:42:33,221 --> 01:42:35,689
I hope you guys arent too pissed off at us.

1364
01:42:35,757 --> 01:42:37,349
Were so bummed!

1365
01:42:39,594 --> 01:42:42,119
We liked Brittany and Tiffany...

1366
01:42:42,230 --> 01:42:44,824
so much more when you were them.

1367
01:42:45,834 --> 01:42:47,563
So much more!

1368
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:52,037
So I guess this means
we wont be hanging out any more?

1369
01:42:52,107 --> 01:42:54,974
Dont say that. Of course, we will hang out.

1370
01:42:55,043 --> 01:42:57,773
Oh, yeah. Well all get together
and were gonna go...

01:42:57,846 --> 01:43:00,280
