2
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,110
don't come for me if there are mistakes

3
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,090
He's here.

4
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,920
Professor Perlman.
-Welcome, welcome.

5
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,340
Thank you so much.
-It's so nice to-

6
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,760
Oh my goodness, you're-
you're bigger than your picture!

7
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,870
Well I couldn't get all of me in the photo,
that's the problem.

8
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,680
Mrs. Perlman.
-Annella.

9
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,000
Oliver. Very nice to meet you,
thank you for having me in your home.

10
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,590
Elio!

11
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,220
You must be exhausted.

12
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,540
Ah, what gave me away?

13
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,310
Elio, Oliver. Oliver, Elio.

14
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,100
How you doing?
-Nice to meet you. Elio.

15
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,730
You must be exhausted!

16
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,970
Little bit.
-Ha ha ha! Come, come, come.

17
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,820
May I bring your things up to your room?
-Uh, sure, yeah.

18
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,620
My room?

19
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,370
Follow him.

20
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,480
You're very welcome here.

21
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,810
Our home is your home.

22
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,900
Hello!

23
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:30,970
Hey.

24
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,960
Oh.

25
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,330
My room is now your room.

26
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,820
I'll be next door.

27
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,040
We have to share the bathroom.

28
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,130
It's my only way out.

29
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,010
We're being called for dinner!

30
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,360
(Oliver snores)

31
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,810
Oh, sorry the uh...

32
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,880
We're being called for dinner.

33
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,960
Um, yeah, um, I'm probably gonna pass.

34
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,960
Will you make me an excuse for me
for your mom though?

35
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,840
Thanks man.

36
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,690
So this is your old room, huh?

37
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,290
Thanks.

38
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,320
Later.

39
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,540
Wow look at this!

40
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,540
Good morning professor, good morning.
-From the dead.

41
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,730
Was I up that long?
-It seems like it. How- how are you?

42
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,210
I- uh- well, rested now, thank you.

43
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,320
Glad, would you like some espresso?

44
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,520
I would love some, thank you very much.

45
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,280
This looks amazing.
I didn't take your seat did I?

46
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,100
Oh, no, no, no, it's ok, please.

47
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,820
Did you- did you recover from your trip?

48
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,930
Uh, I did, yeah. Big time, thank you.

49
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,330
I could show you around.

50
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,330
That'd be great, thank you.
Um, is there a-

51
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,600
is there a bank in town? I'd love to start an account while I'm here.

52
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,240
Sorry.

53
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,840
Ah, it happens to the best of us.

54
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,560
Yeah, well.

55
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,380
None of our residents have ever
had a local bank account.

56
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,260
Really?
-Mm.

57
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,540
Should I take him to ...?

58
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,060
I think they're closed for summer vacation.

59
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,620
You try uh, Crema.

60
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,620
Crema?

61
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,980
Is this your orchard?

62
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
These are Annella's trees.
-Oh, wow.

63
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,060
Pomegranate.

64
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,460
Have another egg.

65
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,210
No, no, no.

66
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,060
I know myself too well, if I have a second
I'm just gonna have a third,

67
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,320
and then a fourth and then you're just
gonna have to roll me out of here.

68
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,140
Delicious.

69
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,850
Darling?

70
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:32,940
Thank you.

71
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,770
Should I give him Anchise's bike?

72
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,600
What does one do around here?

73
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,000
Wait for the summer to end.

74
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,280
Yeah?

75
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,180
What do you do in the winter?
Wait for summer to come?
-Well,

76
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,480
we only come here for Christmas
and some other vacations.

77
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,490
Christmas? I thought you were-
I thought you were Jewish?
-and Easter as well.

78
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:33,460
Well, we are Jewish but also American, Italian,
French- somewhat a typical combination.

79
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,380
Besides my family you're probably the
only other Jew to set foot in this town.

80
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,080
I'm from a small town in New England.
I know what it's like to be the odd Jew out.

81
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,860
So what do you do around here?

82
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,420
Read books, transcribe music, swim at
the river, go out at night. I don't know.

83
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,660
That sounds fun.

84
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,250
Alright buddy, thanks for the help.

85
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,460
Oops, sorry. Sorry about that.

86
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,280
It's alright.

87
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,140
Alright, later!

88
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,120
What do you have there?

89
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,120
That should all be-

90
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:40,210
What is this? Uh, these are the continuation
of these archeology department.

91
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,280
These are archeology? Yeah, those archeology,
the rest of these should be history.

92
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,460
More apricot juice?

93
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,960
Yeah.

94
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,620
Here.
-Thank you.

95
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,620
Help yourself to some more.

96
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,780
The word 'apricot' comes from the Arabic.

97
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,260
It's like the words 'algebra', 'alchemy', 'alcohol'.

98
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,140
It derives from an Arabic noun combined
with the Arabic article 'al' before it.

99
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,920
The origin of our Italian "albicocca"...

100
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,370
is 'albaricoque'.

101
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,300
Now it's amazing that today in Israel,
in many Arab countries,

102
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,780
the fruit's referred to by a totally different name:

103
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,200
"mishmish".

104
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,960
I may have to disagree with you there professor.

105
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,620
Ah?

106
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,700
I'm gonna talk in etymology
so just bear with me a second.

107
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,580
Um, you're right in the case that most Latin words
do find their origins in Greek words, however

108
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,520
in the case of apricot it's a little bit
more of a complicated journey.

109
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,440
Ah, how so?

110
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,260
Ah, well here the Greek actually
takes over from the Latin.

111
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,420
Latin word being "praecocum" or "praecoquis"

112
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,020
so it's pre-cooked or pre-ripened as you know,
not to be precocious or premature.

113
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,760
And the Byzantines to go on,
then borrowed "praecox"

114
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,000
which became "praecocia"
which then became "baricoci"

115
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,640
which is how the Arabs got "albaricoque".

116
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,520
Courtesy of etymology 101.

117
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,520
Flying colours.

118
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,040
He does this every year.

119
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,700
... let's move here.

120
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,700
How do you know about this place?

121
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,680
Okay!

122
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,060
No, no, no, no, no!

123
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,000
Perfect timing!

124
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,340
What's the matter, you alright?
-Huh?

125
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,980
Pinch your nerve?
-I'm okay.

126
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,080
Here, hold this.

127
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,770
Trust me, I'm about to be a doctor.

128
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,640
Hey, hey, hey, come here.
See, that's the problem.

129
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,820
You're too stressed. You just gotta relax a little bit.
-I am relaxing.

130
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,760
Marzia? Come here for a minute.

131
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,220
Back me up here.

132
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,100
Feel that, right there? It's too tight,
right? He needs to relax.
-Oliver!

133
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,280
Later!

134
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,280
You should relax more.

135
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,920
Ok guys, ready?

136
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,320
Woo!

137
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,040
Ok, our ball, our ball, our ball!

138
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
Twelve serving eleven.

139
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,040
Mine, mine, mine, mine!

140
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
Yours, yours, yours!

141
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,560
I don't think he's arrogant.

142
00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:00,440
Just watch, this is how he'll say goodbye to us
when the time comes with his, "later".

143
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,360
Meanwhile we'll have to put up with him for
six long weeks won't we, darling.

144
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,500
I think he's shy.

145
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
You'll grow to like him.

146
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,560
What if I grow to hate him?

147
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,060
(Elio sighs)

148
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,700
Elio. Play something.

149
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,900
You're spoiling everyone's fun.

150
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,660
Hey!
-Hey.

151
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,960
What you doing?
-Reading.

152
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,200
How come you're not with everyone
else down by the river?

153
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,640
I have an allergy.

154
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,660
Yeah, me too.

155
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,440
Maybe we have the same one.

156
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,380
Why don't you and I go swimming?
-Right now?

157
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,440
Yeah, come on!
Let's go!

158
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,160
Do we have to go right now?

159
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,460
I'll go get changed. Meet you downstairs.
-Okay.

160
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,600
See you downstairs.

161
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,320
Elio, what are you doing?

162
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,840
Reading my music.
-No you're not.

163
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,820
Thinking, then.
-Yeah?

164
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,880
'Bout what.

165
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,280
It's private.

166
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,540
You're not gonna tell me?
-I'm not gonna tell you.

167
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,680
He's not gonna tell me what he's thinking about.
-(Annella) Elio!

168
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,440
I guess I'll go hang out with your mom.
More apricot juice!

169
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,060
Good boy, thank god you're helping me.

170
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,160
Sounds nice.

171
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,160
Thought you didn't like it.

172
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,920
Play it again, will ya?

173
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,360
Follow me.

174
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,720
That sounds different. Did you change it? Why?
-I changed it a little bit.

175
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,560
I just played it the way Liszt would have
played it if he'd altered Bach's version.

176
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,780
Play that again.
-Play what again?

177
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,560
The thing you played outside.
-Oh, you want me to play the thing I played outside?

178
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,880
Please.
-Ah. Of course.

179
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,140
I can't believe you changed it again.
-Oh I changed it a little bit.

180
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,220
Yeah, why?

181
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,320
I just played it the way Busoni would have
played it if he'd altered Liszt's version.

182
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,000
And what is wrong with Bach, the way Bach
would have played Bach's version?

183
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,000
-Bach never wrote it for the guitar.

184
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,580
In fact, we're not even sure Bach wrote it at all.

185
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,580
-Forget I asked!

186
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,900
It's young Bach.
He dedicated it to his brother.

187
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,920
Hey, professor.
-Hello.

188
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,220
Oh, here, please. Join me.
-Thank you.

189
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,620
Be honest, how bad is it?

190
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,620
(Michael) I think your insight's...

191
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,640
Ciao.
-Ciao.

192
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,040
Elio. You sleeping?
-Hm?

193
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,860
I was.
-Listen to this dribble. Tell me what you think.

194
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,280
Wait.
-What?

195
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,820
Can't hear you.

196
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,200
For the early Greeks, Heidegger contends,
this underlying hiddenness is constitutive of the way beings are,

197
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,400
not only in relation to themselves but also
in relation to other entities generally.

198
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,920
In other words, they do not construe hiddenness merely or
primarily in terms of entities' relation to human beings.

199
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,620
Does that make any sense to you?
Doesn't make any sense to me.

200
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,240
I don't think it makes any sense to your dad either.

201
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,940
Maybe it did when he wrote it.

202
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,820
That might be the kindest thing anybody
has said to me in months.

203
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,300
Kind?
-Yep. Kind.

204
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,800
(Armie Hammer dances quite horribly)

205
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,120
We almost had sex last night, Marzia and me.

206
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,480
Why didn't you?

207
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,740
I don't know.

208
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:22,060
Well you know it's better to have tried than failed, right?

209
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,040
All I had to do was find the courage to

210
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,960
reach out and touch. She would have said yes.

211
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Well, try again later.

212
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,960
Try what later?

213
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,680
I just heard from the people in Sirmione,
they say they've come up with something.

214
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,440
Oh! Fantastic!

215
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,880
Going there today.
Would you like to come along?

216
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,880
I would love to, thank you.

217
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,700
Smell this.
-Can I come too?

218
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,360
Uh, on the condition you remain silent.

219
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:50,700
Silent as in he has too many opinions or silent as in
not telling anybody what amazing thing you've dug up?

220
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,380
Well nothing has been dug up, it's what has been brought out.
Out of the water.

221
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,840
Dad always sits up front with Anchise to navigate.

222
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,100
She seems to like you a lot.

223
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,960
More beautiful than she was last year.

224
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,560
I saw her naked on a night swim once... great body.

225
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,640
Tryna get me to like her?
-What would be the harm in that?

226
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,480
Not no harm, just typically like to go
those things on my own if you don't mind.

227
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,380
Just don't play at being a good host.

228
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,860
What's going on boys?

229
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,540
Oliver, come.

230
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,040
Sit up front, be my navigator.

231
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,040
What? What?

232
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,900
Look who's here!

233
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,680
He's grown a bit, eh?
And this is Oliver.

234
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,480
Ciao!

235
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,560
Hey boys!

236
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:32,480
The ship went down in 1827 on the way to Isola Del Garda.

237
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:39,840
Gossip has it this statue was a gift from
Count to his lover Contralto.

238
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:48,340
There are four known sets after the Praxiteles' originals,
this fellow's at number three.

239
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,640
The Emperor Hadrian had a pair dug up at Tivoli, but uh,

240
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,940
one of the more philistine of the Farnese popes
melted them down and had them recast as

241
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,600
a particularly voluptuous Venus.

242
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,780
Who'd like to go for a swim before we head back?

243
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,040
Elio!
-Oliver!

244
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,180
Hey, hey!
-I have to go!

245
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,980
Goodness!

246
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,040
Are you going too?
-No, no. I should stay and do some work on my book.

247
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,060
Oh, come on!
How 'bout a drink to celebrate the day?

248
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,020
Okay maybe just one.
-Alright!

249
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,760
Marzia?

250
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,620
(Elio) Cosmic fragments by Heraclitus.

251
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,240
(Oliver) The meaning of the river flowing is not that all things
are changing so that we cannot encounter them twice

252
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,380
but that some things stay the same only by changing.

253
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,580
Hm.

254
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,360
Darling have you seen my Heptaméron?

255
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,620
Mafalda.

256
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,780
It's in German.

257
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,380
Okay.

258
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,900
Can't remember where we left off
but I think you'll like this one.

259
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,120
So, I'll translate, huh?

260
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:16,040
A handsome young knight is madly in love with a princess,
and she too is in love with him,

261
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,760
though she seems not to be entirely aware of it,

262
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,760
despite the friendship

263
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:30,060
that blossoms between them, or

264
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:33,040
perhaps because of that very friendship,

265
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,760
the young knight finds himself so-

266
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,100
so humbled and speechless,

267
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,460
but he's totally unable to bring up the subject of his love.

268
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,020
So one day he asks the princess, point blank,

269
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,740
"Is it better to speak, or to die?".

270
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,880
I'll never have the courage to ask a question like that.

271
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,500
I doubt that.

272
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,020
Hey, Eli belly.

273
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,180
You do know that you can always talk to us.

274
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,340
My mom has been reading this
16th century French romance.

275
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,180
She read some of it to my dad and I
the night the lights went out.

276
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:44,220
Is that about the knight that doesn't know whether to speak or die?
-Right.

277
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,120
So does he or doesn't he?

278
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,900
"Better to speak" she said.

279
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,260
But she's on her guard.

280
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,100
She senses a trap somewhere.

281
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,280
So does he speak?

282
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,540
Nope.

283
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,200
He fudges.
-Hm.

284
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,300
It figures. He's French.

285
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:27,760
I gotta go to town in a little bit to pick some things up.
-Oh, I can go I'm not doing anything today.

286
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,480
Why don't we go together?
-Right now?

287
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,980
Yeah, right now.

288
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,400
It is of course unless you have more
important business going on.

289
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,400
(ELIO MOCKS OLIVER)

290
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,500
Mind if I put this in your bag?
-Yes, please.

291
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:16,540
I fell. I was coming home the other day
and I scraped myself pretty badly.

292
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,720
Anchise insisted I apply some kind of witch's brew.

293
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,780
I think it helped.

294
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,800
Hold this for a second, will ya?

295
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:08,000
Want one?
-Sure.

296
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,860
Not bad, huh?
-Not bad at all.

297
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,540
Thought you didn't smoke.
-I don't.

298
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:51,040
So WWII, huh?
-Oh no, this is WWI.

299
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,740
You have to be at least 80 years old
to have known any of them.

300
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,920
I never even heard of the Battle of Piave.

301
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,720
Battle of Piave was one of the
most lethal battles of WWI.

302
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,740
A hundred and seventy thousand people died.

303
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,280
Is there anything you don't know?

304
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,540
I know nothing, Oliver.

305
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,440
Well you seem to know more than
anybody else around here.

306
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,200
Well if only you know how little I know
about the things that matter.

307
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,820
What things that matter?

308
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,080
You know what things.

309
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,600
Why are you telling me this?

310
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,460
'Cause I thought you should know?

311
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,220
Because you thought I should know?

312
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,380
'Cause I wanted you to know?

313
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,800
'Cause I wanted you to know.

314
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,700
'Cause I wanted you to know.

315
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,420
'Cause I wanted you to know.

316
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,420
Because there's no one else
I can say this to but you?

317
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,760
You saying what I think you're saying?

318
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,740
Don't go anywhere.
Stay right here.

319
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,600
You know I'm not going anywhere.

320
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,580
They mixed up all of my pages.
I'm going to have to retype this whole thing.

321
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:26,340
I'm not gonna have anything to work on after this.
This is gonna set me back a whole day.

322
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,040
Damnit.

323
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,360
Shouldn't have said anything.

324
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,260
Just pretend you never did.
-Oh, does that mean we're on speaking terms but not really?

325
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,240
Means we can't talk about those kinds of things,

326
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,000
'kay?

327
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,660
We just can't.

328
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,560
Hey!

329
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,100
Ready?
-Let's go.

330
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:04,700
Pretty much.

331
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,840
Oh my god.

332
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,960
You thirsty?
-Yeah.

333
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,680
That's Italy.

334
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,080
Come on!

335
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,820
This is my spot.
It's all mine.

336
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,820
Come here to read.

337
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,160
Can't tell you the number of books I've read here.

338
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,200
Oh my god it's freezing!

339
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,980
Spring is in the mountains.

340
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,960
The water comes straight down from there.

341
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,200
I like the way you say things.

342
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,380
Don't know why you're always
putting yourself down, though.

343
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,800
So you won't? I guess?

344
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,960
You really that afraid of what I think?

345
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:07,220
You're making things very difficult for me.

346
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,860
(Elio sighs)

347
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,500
I love this, Oliver.

348
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,300
(Oliver sighs)

349
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,080
What?

350
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,740
Everything.

351
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:39,900
Us, you mean?

352
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:45,120
Ah, it's not bad. It's not bad.

353
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,280
Better now?

354
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,740
No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

355
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,760
We should go.
-Why?

356
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,060
I know myself, 'kay?

357
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,640
And we've been good.
We haven't done anything to be ashamed of.

358
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,000
And that's a good thing.

359
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,680
I wanna be good.

360
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,120
Okay?

361
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,760
Am I offending you?

362
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:20,920
Just don't.

363
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,380
I think it's starting to get infected.

364
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:35,480
Stop at the pharmacist on the way back.
-Excellent idea.

365
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,000
Elio?

366
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:23,160
Elio, you alright?

367
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,720
Sit for a second.

368
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,340
If you insist.

369
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,200
That wasn't my fault, right?
-No.

370
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:40,020
I'm a mess.

371
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,020
Well.

372
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,640
The kitchen table sure is.

373
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,020
Ow, where'd you learn to do that?

374
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,180
My bubbe used to do this for us when we were sick.

375
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,820
Trust me, it helps.

376
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,500
I used to have one of these.

377
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,500
Used to?
-Yeah.

378
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:09,100
How come you never wear it?

379
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,720
My mother says we are Jews of discretion.

380
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:13,940
Well,

381
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,360
I guess that works for your mother.

382
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,720
Funny witch.

383
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,200
Ow you'll fucking kill me if you do that.

384
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,200
Oh, I hope not.

385
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,480
Hey, are you leaving?
-Where's Elio?

386
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,520
He's inside, he had a bit of a nosebleed
during lunch so he's just resting.

387
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,860
Ah, really?
-Yeah.

388
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:50,540
Okay, I'll be back in a minute.
Don't go anywhere.

389
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,460
Traitor.

390
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:20,040
Traitor.

391
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:01,180
Please don't avoid me. Kills me.
Can't stand thinking you hate me.

392
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:05,180
Your silence is killing me. I'd sooner die than
know you hate me. I am such a pussy.

393
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,680
Way over the top.

394
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,200
Can't stand the silence.

395
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:23,920
I need to speak to you.

396
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:48,700
Someone have a good night last night?

397
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:51,440
Hm.

398
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:57,160
Well you must be tired then.

399
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,720
Or were you playing poker too?

400
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,640
I don't play poker.

401
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:07,380
Several hundred colour slides of our boxer and
the others like them arrived yesterday from Berlin.

402
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,840
We should start cataloging them.

403
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,400
That'll keep us busy 'till lunch I imagine.
-Sure.

404
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,040
Oh, beautiful aren't they?

405
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:21,380
But they're all so incredibly sensual.

406
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:25,080
Because these are more Hellenistic
during 5th century Athenian.

407
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:28,240
Most likely sculpted under the influence of Praxiteles.

408
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,800
"Greatest sculptor in antiquity".

409
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,720
(Oliver) Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.

410
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:15,160
(Elio) Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.

411
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,680
Muscles are firm.
Look at his stomach for example.

412
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:24,540
Not a straight body in these statues,
they're all curved.

413
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,620
Sometimes impossibly curved,
and so nonchalant.

414
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:31,600
Hence their ageless ambiguity.

415
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:34,540
As if they're daring you to desire them.

416
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,360
Don't forget, Isaac and Mounir are coming for dinner.

417
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,960
Also known as Sonny and Cher.
-Okay.

418
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:04,000
I'd like you to wear that shirt they gave
you for your birthday.
-No.

419
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:08,420
Darling they bought it from Miami!
-I'm sorry it's too big, it's too big.

420
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:10,380
Come on, it'd make them so happy.
-It looks ridiculous on me.

421
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:14,020
I'll try it on for Oliver. If Oliver thinks I look like
a scarecrow in it, I'm not wearing it.

422
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,260
Oliver?

423
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:18,300
Hey, what time you got?

424
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:20,360
It's two.

425
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,340
Well, later.

426
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,620
Later.

427
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:41,380
Mafalda.

428
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:44,740
Um, uh,

429
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,420
How are you?
-Hey, I'm good.

430
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:31,100
Good to see you.
-It's great to see you.

431
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:41,100
No, no, I have to go.

432
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:44,680
Have a nice evening.
-Oh, thank you.

433
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:51,540
This right here,

434
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:55,900
is the brand new china that
you guys so kindly sent to us.

435
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:59,340
Oh, it looks wonderful!
Come here Mounir, Mounir, come, come, come.

436
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:05,420
I can't put it on now they've already met me,
it'll look like a put-up job!
-Yes, you can!

437
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,900
Papa! Papa! It'll look like a put-up job!
-Yes-

438
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:10,300
No misbehaving tonight, no- no laughing.

439
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,340
When I tell you to play, you'll play.

440
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:16,100
You- you're too old not to accept people for who they are.
What's wrong with them?

441
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:19,020
What's wrong with them!
You call them Sonny and Cher behind their back?

442
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:21,220
That's what mom calls them!
-Then you accept gifts from them?

443
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,280
The only person that reflects badly on is you.

444
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,820
Is it because they're gay or because they're ridiculous.

445
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:32,400
You know as much about economics at Mounir's age

446
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,400
you'll be a very wise man indeed.

447
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,520
And a- credit to me.

448
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,080
Now- now, get into this you.

449
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,860
These are, unbelievable, I just uh-

450
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:47,800
I'm sorry I have to go to bed.
Sorry I'm so tired.

451
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:52,280
Elio. Elio.

452
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,840
Thank you.
-Goodnight.

453
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,900
Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

454
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,340
Do I know you?

455
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:13,760
I'm glad you came.

456
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,280
I'm nervous.

457
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,360
Like what you've done with the place.

458
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:10,440
It's nice.

459
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:38,840
You ok?

460
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:45,860
Me ok.

461
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:14,140
Can I kiss you?
-Yes please.

462
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:15,520
What are you doing?

463
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,720
Nothing.

464
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:31,360
This make you happy?

465
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:35,280
You're not gonna get a nosebleed on me, are ya?

466
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,080
I'm not gonna get a-

467
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,640
Off, off, off, off, off!

468
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:13,660
Just pull it.

469
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,360
Or I'll pull it.

470
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:49,720
Oliver.

471
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:33,620
Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine.

472
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,420
Elio.

473
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:42,820
Oliver.

474
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:46,660
Elio.

475
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:49,500
Oliver.

476
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,600
Elio.

477
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:05,300
Did we make noise?

478
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:07,300
Nothing to worry about.

479
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,860
I don't know, Mafalda always looks for signs.

480
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:11,920
Well she's not gonna find any.

481
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,900
You wore that shirt the first day you were here.

482
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:24,880
Will you give it to me when you go?

483
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:37,580
Let's go swimming.

484
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:32,760
Are you gonna hold what happened
last night against me?

485
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:34,640
No.

486
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:44,800
Elio.

487
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:46,500
Come here.

488
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,400
Take your trunks off.

489
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:11,780
Well that's promising.
-You're hard again.

490
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:12,900
Good.

491
01:31:57,740 --> 01:31:59,860
Professor, I got your note.
Uh, thank you for reminding me.

492
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:01,720
I'm gonna go into town to
pick up those typed pages today.

493
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:03,720
So maybe this afternoon would
be a good time to-

494
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:05,740
Later.

495
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,360
... before you leave.

496
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:11,100
Okay.

497
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,300
So, later.

498
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:14,560
Later!

499
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:27,600
Oliver!

500
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,040
You're not sick of me yet?

501
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:43,000
No, I just- I just wanted to be with you.

502
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,120
I'll- I'm gonna- I'll go.

503
01:32:50,780 --> 01:32:52,800
Do you know how happy I am
that we slept together?

504
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:56,160
I don't know.

505
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:59,080
Of course you don't know.

506
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:03,540
I don't want you to regret anything.

507
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:08,040
And I hate the thought that maybe
I might have messed you up or,

508
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:13,100
I don't want either of us to pay for this.
-No I- it's not like I'm gonna tell anyone you,

509
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:15,920
y- you're not gonna be like in any trouble.

510
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:17,800
That's not what I'm talking about.

511
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:31,200
Are you happy I came here?

512
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:39,900
I'd kiss you if I could.

513
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:52,780
Oh, fuck.

514
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:28,460
Fuck.

515
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:45,040
Fuck.

516
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:45,540
What did you do?

517
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:48,100
Nothing.
-No?

518
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,460
Oh, I see.

519
01:38:58,820 --> 01:39:02,700
You've moved onto the plant kingdom already.
What's next, minerals?

520
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,500
I suppose you've already given up
animals, you know that's me.

521
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:08,440
I'm sick, aren't I?

522
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:13,520
I wish everybody was as sick as you.

523
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:17,360
Please don't do that.
-You wanna see something sick?

524
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,720
You wanna see something sick?
-Please don't do this.

525
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,280
Hey! Please don't do this.

526
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:27,660
Why are you doing this to me?

527
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:32,420
What are you doing? Stop, you're fucking hurting me.
-Then don't fight.

528
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:42,280
(ELIO SOBS)

529
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:46,980
Come here.

530
01:39:55,340 --> 01:39:56,780
Sorry.

531
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:58,340
It's ok.

532
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:19,520
It's ok.

533
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,340
I don't want you to go.

534
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:28,120
God, we wasted so many days.

535
01:40:28,780 --> 01:40:30,880
Why didn't you give me a sign?
-I did.

536
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,060
You didn't give me a sign.
-I did!

537
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:33,080
When did- when?

538
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:36,020
You remember when we were playing volleyball?

539
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:38,020
And I touched you

540
01:40:39,380 --> 01:40:40,920
just to show you

541
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:43,340
that I liked you?

542
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:47,280
The way you reacted made me feel like I molested you.
-Sorry, I'm sorry.

543
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,240
No, it's fine. I just decided
I should keep my distance.

544
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:52,980
I don't know.

545
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:00,400
I come out here for hours almost every night.

546
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:02,640
I didn't know that.

547
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:07,040
That's funny, I-

548
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:09,080
I thought that...

549
01:41:09,620 --> 01:41:12,240
Yeah I know what you thought.
-Stop, stop.

550
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:55,060
For Oliver, from Elio.

551
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,160
Elio?

552
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:26,300
I had to work.

553
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:33,800
Yeah, I don't know, I just uh-

554
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:49,140
I'm- I'm not your girl?

555
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:14,600
Oliver has to go to Bergamo for a few days.

556
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:15,580
Oh?

557
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:17,800
Research at the university.

558
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:20,880
Then he'll fly home from Linate.

559
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:24,140
Oh but what about Elio?

560
01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:29,080
Maybe it could be nice for the two of them

561
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:31,400
to get away for a couple of days, no?

562
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:36,880
What do you think?

563
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:41,680
... our favourite student.

564
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:43,680
You must come back.
-You sure you're not just saying that?

565
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:45,740
Oliver.
-Thank you very much, professor.

566
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:49,020
Oh, man.

567
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:54,740
Please, please, come back soon.
-Come back? I'm just going home to pack. I'm living here!

568
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
You're welcome!

569
01:43:58,460 --> 01:43:59,480
Oh, well.

570
01:44:00,410 --> 01:44:02,300
Thank you guys so much.
-Ah, of course.

571
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:03,690
Oliver, Oliver.

572
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:05,700
Come back.

573
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:10,180
Come here, come here. It's been amazing. Thank you guys.
-Oh, oh.

574
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:11,770
Well,

575
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:13,370
later Perlmans.

576
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,000
Later! Later, later, later!

577
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:28,140
Tell Elio to call when you get there!

578
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:33,330
Oh no!

579
01:45:04,370 --> 01:45:05,130
What?

580
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:06,540
Nothing.
-What!

581
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:07,380
Nothing.

582
01:45:35,410 --> 01:45:36,500
Yes!

583
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:37,900
Woo!

584
01:45:40,210 --> 01:45:41,370
Oliver!

585
01:45:41,970 --> 01:45:43,460
Elio!

586
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:45,690
Elio!

587
01:45:57,420 --> 01:45:59,410
Woo!

588
01:45:59,410 --> 01:46:02,800
Oliver!
-Elio!

589
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:07,240
Woo!

590
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:08,890
You hear that?

591
01:48:10,540 --> 01:48:12,060
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

592
01:48:14,730 --> 01:48:17,180
No, no, no! It's this-
it's this way come on!

593
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:18,610
You're missing it!

594
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:20,480
Come on!

595
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:23,540
Woo!

596
01:49:25,570 --> 01:49:26,800
What'd she say?

597
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,640
Did you get your passport?

598
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:28,200
Fuck.

599
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,060
How are you?

600
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:01,610
Good.

601
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:02,760
Missed you at dinner.

602
01:57:26,860 --> 01:57:27,940
So?

603
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:31,290
Welcome home.

604
01:57:31,660 --> 01:57:32,420
Thanks.

605
01:57:34,130 --> 01:57:36,290
Oliver enjoy the trip?
-Yeah.

606
01:57:36,930 --> 01:57:37,900
Think he did.

607
01:57:39,450 --> 01:57:41,050
You two had a nice friendship.

608
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:44,090
Yeah.

609
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:53,500
You're too smart not to know how rare,

610
01:57:55,730 --> 01:57:58,640
how special, what you two had was.

611
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,560
Oliver was Oliver.
-Mm.

612
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:14,540
Oliver may be very intelligent but-
-Oh, no, no.

613
01:58:14,540 --> 01:58:16,260
He was more than intelligent.

614
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:19,740
What you two had,

615
01:58:21,380 --> 01:58:24,340
had everything and nothing to do with intelligence.

616
01:58:25,010 --> 01:58:26,060
He was good.

617
01:58:28,340 --> 01:58:31,300
You were both lucky to have
found each other because...

618
01:58:32,420 --> 01:58:34,200
You too are good.

619
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:43,200
I think he was better than me.

620
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:51,770
I'm sure he'd say the same thing about you.

621
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:53,770
Yeah, he'd say the same thing.

622
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:56,000
Which flatters you both.

623
01:58:59,980 --> 01:59:01,580
When you least expect it,

624
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:07,100
nature has cunning ways of finding our weakest spot.

625
01:59:09,700 --> 01:59:10,640
Just...

626
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:13,320
remember I'm here.

627
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:23,340
Right now you may not want to feel anything.

628
01:59:24,660 --> 01:59:26,960
Maybe you never wanted to feel anything.

629
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:29,090
And uh,

630
01:59:30,450 --> 01:59:33,980
maybe it's not me you want to speak about these things but uh,

631
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:38,570
feel something you obviously did.

632
01:59:42,740 --> 01:59:44,980
Look, you had a beautiful friendship,

633
01:59:46,650 --> 01:59:48,220
maybe more than a friendship.

634
01:59:49,900 --> 01:59:50,940
And I envy you.

635
01:59:54,260 --> 01:59:57,690
My place, most parents would hope the whole thing goes away.

636
01:59:58,330 --> 02:00:00,760
Pray their sons land on their feet, but...

637
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:04,820
I am not such a parent.

638
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:11,620
We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster,

639
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:15,010
that we go bankrupt by the age of 30,

640
02:00:16,540 --> 02:00:19,760
and have less to offer each time we start with someone new.

641
02:00:22,380 --> 02:00:24,220
But to make yourself feel nothing,

642
02:00:25,170 --> 02:00:26,840
so as not to feel anything,

643
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:30,000
what a waste.

644
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:39,440
Have I spoke enough?

645
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:45,960
Then I'll say one more thing.

646
02:00:49,580 --> 02:00:50,890
It'll clear the air.

647
02:00:53,770 --> 02:00:55,410
I may have come close,

648
02:00:56,740 --> 02:00:58,650
but I never had what you two have.

649
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:02,760
Something always...

650
02:01:03,820 --> 02:01:04,840
held me back,

651
02:01:05,970 --> 02:01:07,650
or stood in the way.

652
02:01:12,700 --> 02:01:14,880
How you live your life is your business.

653
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:15,680
Just...

654
02:01:16,540 --> 02:01:17,680
remember.

655
02:01:19,770 --> 02:01:23,100
Our hearts in our bodies are given to us only once,

656
02:01:24,050 --> 02:01:24,970
and...

657
02:01:26,380 --> 02:01:27,850
before you know it,

658
02:01:27,850 --> 02:01:29,220
your heart's worn out.

659
02:01:29,660 --> 02:01:31,810
And as for your body?

660
02:01:32,250 --> 02:01:34,380
There comes a point where no one looks at it.

661
02:01:36,050 --> 02:01:37,920
Much less wants to come near it.

662
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:42,450
Right now,

663
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:44,980
there's sorrow...

664
02:01:46,490 --> 02:01:47,490
pain...

665
02:01:47,490 --> 02:01:49,490
don't kill it.

666
02:01:51,120 --> 02:01:53,570
And with it, the joy you felt.

667
02:02:05,890 --> 02:02:07,140
Does mom know?

668
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:14,400
I don't think she does.

669
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:16,770
I'll get it!

670
02:04:21,820 --> 02:04:23,800
(Elio? You there?)

671
02:04:24,690 --> 02:04:25,500
Hi!

672
02:04:26,170 --> 02:04:27,050
(Hey!)

673
02:04:27,330 --> 02:04:28,480
How are you?

674
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:30,960
(I'm good, I'm good. How are you?)

675
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:32,960
I'm good! They're fine.
-(How are your parents?)

676
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:33,820
(Good.)

677
02:04:36,210 --> 02:04:37,400
I missed you.

678
02:04:38,620 --> 02:04:39,920
(I missed you, too.)

679
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:42,160
(Very much.)

680
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:47,480
(I have some news.)

681
02:04:47,690 --> 02:04:49,210
N- news?

682
02:04:51,930 --> 02:04:53,700
Oh, you're getting married?

683
02:04:54,050 --> 02:04:55,210
I suppose..?

684
02:04:57,680 --> 02:05:00,450
(I might be getting married next spring, yeah.)

685
02:05:03,690 --> 02:05:05,370
You never said anything.

686
02:05:07,370 --> 02:05:09,930
(It's been off and on for two years.)

687
02:05:13,660 --> 02:05:15,080
That's wonderful news.

688
02:05:17,140 --> 02:05:18,060
(Do you mind?)

689
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:28,970
Oliver! Oliver!
-(Hey, hey, hey!)

690
02:05:28,970 --> 02:05:30,810
Oh darling when are you coming back?

691
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:32,360
(Oh, I wish I was.)

692
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:36,170
You caught us in the process of choosing the new you for next summer.

693
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:39,000
And guess what? He's a she!
-(Oh, nice!)

694
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,690
Well speaking of she's,
I'm calling to tell you guys I got engaged!

695
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:45,650
Oh, wonderful!

696
02:05:45,650 --> 02:05:47,650
Congratulations!
-Mazel tov!

697
02:05:47,650 --> 02:05:49,650
Congratulations, Oliver!
-(Thank you, thank you.)

698
02:05:50,050 --> 02:05:51,650
Listen, w-we'll leave you-

699
02:05:51,650 --> 02:05:53,440
we'll- we'll let you speak to Elio.

700
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:55,440
Happy Hanukkah!

701
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:56,370
Bye, sweetheart.

702
02:06:04,570 --> 02:06:06,000
They know about us.

703
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:08,600
I figured.

704
02:06:11,180 --> 02:06:11,970
How?

705
02:06:13,860 --> 02:06:16,140
Well, from the way your dad spoke to me.

706
02:06:17,250 --> 02:06:19,560
He made me feel like I was a part of the family.

707
02:06:19,770 --> 02:06:21,360
Almost like a son-in-law.

708
02:06:23,330 --> 02:06:24,490
You're so lucky.

709
02:06:25,970 --> 02:06:28,850
My father would have carted me off to a correctional facility.

710
02:06:31,370 --> 02:06:32,360
Elio?

711
02:06:36,130 --> 02:06:40,200
Elio, Elio, Elio, Elio, Elio, Elio, Elio, Elio.

712
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:45,410
Oliver.

713
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:50,000
I remember everything.

714
02:10:54,730 --> 02:10:56,100
Elio.

715
02:10:58,320 --> 02:10:59,730
Elio?

716
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:09,020
