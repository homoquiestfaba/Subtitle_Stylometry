1
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,175
Watch your backs!

2
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:18,511
When Mr Westicott fired you,
did he tell you why?

3
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:26,601
He said his
wife is afraid of me.

4
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,218
Did you ever speak to his wife?

5
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,684
I praise her.

6
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,757
I tell her she has hips.
Good for many children.

7
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:46,635
Large, like my best sheep.

8
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,887
You told her this?

9
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,302
Just tell him to not speak
to his boss's wife.

10
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:58,212
<i>I'll straighten this out with Mr Westicott
and you can go to work tomorrow.</i>

11
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,801
My cousin, he hates his new neighbours.
Egyptians. My age, mostly.

12
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,549
Nine blokes in one flat. Nine.

13
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:09,877
- Well, he should talk to his landlord.
- Yo, it's a council estate, innit?

14
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,880
Housing office then.

15
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:14,636
Yo. He already did that
and they sent Immigration round.

16
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:16,464
And?

17
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:18,670
And nothing. They were out that day.

18
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,506
Ooh, la la. I've never
been to Paris before. Beautiful, no?

19
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,962
- Yeah, it is. Will you put that down, please?
- Relax. I'm not gonna break it.

20
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,380
OK.

21
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,502
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:38,386
Your minicab licence,
um, expires in a week.

23
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,878
I need you to fill in this form for me.

24
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,934
- Your tea is cold.
- Sorry I'm late.

25
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,676
You get my email?

26
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:56,635
Nice to see you too, Alice.

27
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,753
How are the salt mines treating you?

28
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,215
My email, Emily.

29
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:07,261
MI5 raided the flat an hour ago.

30
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,593
And? 'Empty.

31
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,795
Nine Egyptian nationals
cleared out this morning.

32
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:14,009
Oh, Jesus Christ.

33
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,002
We have a good lead, though.

34
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,427
- Should have them in custody shortly.
- Shortly?

35
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:22,422
- If these guys are who I think they are...
- But we don't know that yet, do we?

36
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,298
But, as I said, the lead is solid.

37
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:30,840
- You'll call me?
- Of course.

38
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:34,716
- Soon as you have them.
- I promise.

39
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,093
Hello, can I get...

40
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,672
Henry, come.

41
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,755
Emily?

42
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,934
<i>CIA intel is
always welcome, Alice,</i>

43
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,505
<i>and your cover is brilliant.</i>

44
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,755
<i>But those Egyptians...</i>

45
00:04:57,292 --> 00:05:00,011
<i>- They're students.
- Students? Really?</i>

46
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,091
Yes. Undergrads at UCL.
The past three years.

47
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,886
Are you sure?
They really fit the profile.

48
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,226
<i>Complete background checks.</i>

49
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,924
- They're absolutely clean.
- Okay.

50
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,128
Well, thanks for looking into it.

51
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,752
Shh.

52
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,836
Dogcatcher, Dogcatcher,
engage now.

53
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,301
Copy that. We see him.

54
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,002
shut up!

55
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,794
Stay down! Give me your hands.

56
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,210
Jim McAllister. We'd flown him in
from Ramstein to interrogate a prisoner.

57
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,719
St Thomas' Hospital is
saying heart attack.

58
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,465
Our own docs are en route, but...

59
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,675
He's dead, right?

60
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:04,964
Sir?

61
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:08,796
Are we expecting that to change
between now and after lunch?

62
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,877
I'm asking because my wife

63
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,586
is sitting alone at Chez Francois
on our anniversary.

64
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:15,759
Why was I called in?

65
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:18,340
The prisoner McAllister
was supposed to unlock.

66
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:21,295
He's a courier for Imam Yazid Khaleel.

67
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:24,966
- Khaleel has prison time left.
- He got a new lawyer.

68
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:26,589
Oh, how nice for him.

69
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:30,042
The Brits have inner-circle assets
saying that he just gave a go order

70
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,594
for an attack on an
American target in the UK.

71
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,423
And we believe the courier
to be carrying it, sir.

72
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,676
American target?

73
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,467
All we have, sir.

74
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:42,671
- Who is the go order for?
- David Mercer.

75
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:48,218
Mercer? Trust-fund jihadi
of Bloomfield Hills.

76
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,629
He goes by his conversion name
now. Mohammed al...

77
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:55,508
Fuck his conversion name.
What is his connection with Khaleel?

78
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,753
The imam's his spiritual authority.

79
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,382
Mercer won't lift a finger
without Khaleel's blessing.

80
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,593
Khaleel gives him credibility.

81
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:09,385
One more thing, sir. The ordered attack...
It's thought to be biological.

82
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,587
Send a car for my wife and flowers.

83
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:24,752
And by flowers, I mean whatever it takes
to keep me off the couch tonight.

84
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:30,919
Please, take a seat.

85
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,094
- Thank you.
- Good evening.

86
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,752
Mr Lasch, please.

87
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,353
- Yes. Please, go through.
- Thank you.

88
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:38,590
- Thank you.
- Hello, Al.

89
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,881
So good to see you.

90
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,294
- You look great.
- Thank you.

91
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,335
So the bus driver says,
"Lady, I'm sorry,"

92
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,878
"you cannot bring a live
chicken on the bus."

93
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,882
So she apologises, snaps its neck
and gets on.

94
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,511
I've told this story before, OK?

95
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,926
Just a few times.

96
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,518
- But it keeps getting better.
- Mmm.

97
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:03,059
The whole feather thing, that was new.

98
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,643
Now you're picking on me.

99
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,969
What is that? New toy from Langley?

100
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,715
Dedicated sat feed of local intercepts.

101
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,380
Here.

102
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,887
- This is live?
- They're beta testing 'em.

103
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:22,918
I want one.

104
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,969
Come on back to the field
and I'll get you one.

105
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,214
I'm not ready for that.

106
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,926
- I lost my nose for it.
- Bullshit.

107
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,601
You don't have the network you're used to.

108
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:35,550
Community embed posts
in allied countries are dead zones.

109
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,719
See, you don't do good with boredom.

110
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,051
I can manage.

111
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,837
All right, look, I'm an asshole.
But we need your skill sets.

112
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:46,260
We need you on the front line.

113
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,836
Last time I was
there, 24 people died.

114
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,052
Not everything is that
bridge in Paris, Alice.

115
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,718
- So how is your divorce coming along?
- OK.

116
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:57,715
All right, we're gonna change the subject.

117
00:10:57,792 --> 00:11:00,101
Oh, people do that when they don't
wanna talk about something.

118
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,048
It was not your fault.

119
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,094
I was your chief back then. I know.

120
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,798
It was not my fault but...

121
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:10,809
If you want me to make peace
with losing people...

122
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,684
I don't. I want you to make
peace with those you saved.

123
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:18,090
No, it was me. I lost them, Eric. Not
Agency. Not Paris station. It was me.

124
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:22,343
I was too slow and too late and you're
crazy to trust me with that again.

125
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,757
I've got 30 years in the craft,
so do me a favour...

126
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,006
Don't ask me to cover
what you can't bear to face.

127
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,502
- I wasn't doing that.
- Yes, you were.

128
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,006
It's understandable.
Nobody wants to face that pain again.

129
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,381
Let the past go.

130
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:40,670
Or it's gonna get in the
way when it counts.

131
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:43,634
Good night.

132
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:13,172
Marburg virus is a Category A
bio-threat threat agent

133
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,094
that may just trump Ebola
for the nightmare trophy.

134
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,886
Intercepts are flagging Russia
as the most likely source.

135
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:23,258
<i>The Soviets produced a weaponised strain
in the '80s called Variant K.</i>

136
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,880
<i>It's on every jihadi's wish list.</i>

137
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,130
And the courier?

138
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:35,715
<i>We snatched him last night.
We have him waiting.</i>

139
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:41,675
<i>It's not what he knows, sir.
It's that Mercer won't have met him yet.</i>

140
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:44,636
The imam never uses the same courier twice.

141
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:48,337
So if we crack the courier for any
recognition measures needed for the meet,

142
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:50,510
switch him out with one of our guys,

143
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,132
we can change the message to
whatever we want.

144
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,968
And if Mercer buys it,
he can shut him down.

145
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:58,216
It was all going beautifully
until our interrogator's ticker gave out.

146
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,755
Are you telling me we don't have
another interrogator in the UK?

147
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,710
Our best people
are in the sandbox.

148
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:07,420
There is another case officer
with London station.

149
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,460
Alice Racine. But...

150
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:10,839
But what? Call her.

151
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:13,636
Actually, sir,
she's had a rocky couple of years.

152
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,551
Who's her COS?

153
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:16,918
I am, sir.

154
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,002
Background?

155
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,836
Racine was a teen runaway.

156
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,504
European born, her mother brought her
to the States when she was 12.

157
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,587
A year later, Child Protective Services
found her on the street.

158
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,298
Multiple foster homes.
Six different schools.

159
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,345
She broke her teacher's arm
when she was 15.

160
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:37,590
Suspected he was touching her classmates.

161
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,587
- He was.
- Mmm. Born a bloodhound.

162
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,094
The cops on her case got her
into the Police Athletic League.

163
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:48,671
Three years later, she had a full
athletic scholarship to Northwestern.

164
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,297
<i>Now we recruited her because she</i>

165
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:54,425
<i>scored off the charts on the Kolbe index and
Special Activities needed interrogators.</i>

166
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,877
What's the rocky part?

167
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,709
<i>The mastermind of the 2012
bridge bombing was her interrogation.</i>

168
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,049
<i>She broke him, too late to stop it.</i>

169
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:07,501
<i>The death toll was a fraction
of the 2015 attacks but she took it hard.</i>

170
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,559
She tried to quit after that,
but her chief at the time

171
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,086
talked both her and the
agency into a transfer

172
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,716
to a cover job in East London
in a jihad-prominent community.

173
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,468
Which is why we didn't consider her.

174
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:21,476
It's been two years since
she's been in the booth,

175
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,719
and just wasn't enough time
to knock the rust off.

176
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:27,217
But given the circumstances,
do you have a better idea?

177
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,876
Anyone?

178
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,797
Alice?

179
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,422
Frank Sutter, London station.

180
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:44,669
Some good reading in there.

181
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,459
Page 12.

182
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,505
The courier's Moroccan.

183
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,632
Some trips to Frankfurt in 2014
for terror training.

184
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,756
The Germans picked him up once, but they
considered him low value and let him go.

185
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,959
No English. Speaks tribal Moroccan Darija.

186
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:33,635
I got an interpreter for you.

187
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,503
He won't know the meet site
until Mercer pings him,

188
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,881
so focus on getting the
recognition protocol.

189
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:42,215
That's what we're counting on from you.

190
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,168
Problem?

191
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,718
You do know my history, right?

192
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,969
If you want me to say you
were HQ's first choice...

193
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:50,339
I don't.

194
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:52,886
That's the point, I don't wanna
be anyone's choice.

195
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:54,635
Except that's not how it works, is it?

196
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:57,044
You're being called up.

197
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:00,425
Now your reluctance is noted,
but this is priority red.

198
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:03,216
And the chief of Europe division
has made his call.

199
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,922
It's not a request.

200
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,227
All right.

201
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,797
Can you make this thicker?

202
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,851
The kind of file that says
that the US Government

203
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,798
has been on your ass
since you were a foetus.

204
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:49,590
Of course. Get on that.

205
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,755
And take the camera out.

206
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,252
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

207
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,127
It's a trust deterrent.

208
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:09,341
Hello, Lateef. I'm Alice.

209
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,464
English?

210
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:13,964
<i>Alarabiyah?</i>

211
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,630
<i>Deutsch?</i>

212
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,090
How about your native Darija?

213
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,434
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

214
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,802
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

215
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:30,487
I'll be back with an interpreter.

216
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:37,715
You just responded to something
I said in English.

217
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,717
Twice.

218
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,653
Just get on with it.

219
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,262
You can send your interpreter home.

220
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:53,169
- He's British born.
- Oh.

221
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,756
Can I have the key for his cuffs, please?

222
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:58,847
What do your parents think of you?

223
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:01,419
I don't know. Why don't you ask them?

224
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:20,758
My mum died and my dad pissed off
when I was young.

225
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:26,919
What were you doing in Frankfurt?

226
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,128
- I was working for a charity.
- Hmm.

227
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,676
Servants of God.

228
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,476
Something wrong with the charities
in the UK?

229
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,959
No. God called me there.

230
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:40,546
- Mmm.
- I found a pure Muslim life there.

231
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:45,419
Lateef...

232
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,927
you still haven't asked
me why you're here.

233
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,044
Yeah, tell me.

234
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:54,671
When prisoners don't ask,
it's because they already know.

235
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,924
He's just sitting in there, on his own.

236
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,633
Time is not our friend right now.
Why don't you use it?

237
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,752
I am using it.

238
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:36,886
So this is what
a pure Muslim life looks like?

239
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:41,547
- No. This is not Islam.
- I would never do this.

240
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,378
The news said that the engine caught fire.

241
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,926
That made you angry, didn't it?

242
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,627
- No.
- Not getting the credit.

243
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,460
Wh... why would I be angry? No!

244
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,589
Have you ever met this man?

245
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,797
- No.
- No?

246
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:56,967
No.

247
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,380
He's an imam. So what?

248
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,968
He was arrested yesterday.

249
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:06,795
He's been charged with plotting
the Sea Empress attack.

250
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,336
Three members of his mosque carried it out.

251
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:14,545
- What's that gotta do with me?
- You tell me.

252
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:15,717
Fine, nothing.

253
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:18,875
You should know that we have two
other members of his mosque in custody.

254
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:21,636
And like you, they learned
bombmaking in Frankfurt.

255
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:23,509
Bombmaking? No. Not like me.

256
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,103
And like you, they have a long,
dark plane ride in their future.

257
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,715
That's their business. It's up to them.

258
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,669
I don't know these people
you're talking about.

259
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,302
Okay. Okay, listen. I can explain these.

260
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,976
I know what you're thinking.
I can prove this.

261
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,753
- Relax. Relax. We already know.
- Please.

262
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,132
Your imam found out that Scotland Yard
had tied him to the Sea Empress

263
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,768
- and he was sending you away.
- No, no, that's not what this is.

264
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,801
Just like he was sending
your two friends away.

265
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,156
No, I'm supposed to deliver
a message for him. That's all.

266
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,801
- Good soldiers, all of you...
- No.

267
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,253
But disposable as Kleenex
for a man like Khaleel.

268
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,335
No, no, no.
You're not listening to me!

269
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:08,091
I'm just supposed to deliver
a message for him, that's all!

270
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,378
Okay, listen. Wait, I've... I've got proof.

271
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,584
I can prove it.

272
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,672
What proof?

273
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:24,794
Now...

274
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,879
If you talk to me, I can
guarantee your safety.

275
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:30,339
What proof?

276
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,378
I always go to the mosque
with my friend every Friday.

277
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,594
And his uncle owns a Moroccan cafe.

278
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,107
He said one day, "Oh, come along..."

279
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,250
- This quote, it's a fatwa.
- Mmm-hmm.

280
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:48,465
Sort of like a spoken rule.

281
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,632
But a fatwa can be about anything,
not just jihad.

282
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,629
Uh-huh. And this one by Ali
is all Lateef needs

283
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,585
to verify his identity to Mercer?

284
00:21:57,667 --> 00:22:00,341
Mmm-hmm. Plus the collection it came from.

285
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,422
What do you mean, collection?

286
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:08,919
Well, many authors recorded Ali's
words, in different collections.

287
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,094
Which collection matters,
especially to an imam.

288
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:14,169
Well, I don't see that here.

289
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,506
It's a quite famous one.
I'll write it down for you.

290
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:18,885
Did he mention the meet?

291
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:21,169
He hasn't got it yet. He'll get a text.

292
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:27,385
Would you excuse me for a second?

293
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,676
Important?

294
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,502
Just my personal life.

295
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,422
Alice, Ed Romley.

296
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,131
Hey, sir, this is not a secure line.

297
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,299
And under any other circumstances,
I wouldn't be using it.

298
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,175
But we've been trying
to reach you for hours.

299
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,468
We need you for an emergency
assignment in London.

300
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:52,702
We've got a prisoner waiting.

301
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:56,590
Well, I'm already on it.

302
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,798
<i>London station brought me in.</i>

303
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,065
What the hell are you talking about?

304
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:04,011
<i>We haven't informed London station.</i>

305
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,005
Sir...

306
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,309
Does your prisoner happen to be

307
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,337
a 19-year-old British national
of Moroccan descent?

308
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:15,880
<i>Yes.</i>

309
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:19,419
<i>What the fuck is going on?</i>

310
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,176
I'll call you back.

311
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:30,589
Alice?

312
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,298
We were talking about fatwa collections.

313
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,673
About which one David Mercer is expecting.

314
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:45,272
Can you write it down for me, please?

315
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,505
Sure.

316
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:00,965
Except, now, I'm wondering about something.

317
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,044
Wondering what?

318
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:09,261
That the kid gave it up too easily.

319
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,843
They are trained to bait us.

320
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,752
You think that's what he's doing?

321
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,343
I just think I should, um...

322
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,754
Run his story again and see if I can
produce any cracks.

323
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,844
Unless you prefer they turn up
at your meet with Mercer.

324
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,544
I'd prefer for you to hurry.

325
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:35,801
We're on a serious clock here.

326
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:37,669
I do understand that, sir.

327
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:47,003
Lateef, I have a few more questions
about Frankfurt.

328
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:49,635
Are you serious?
You said we was done!

329
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:50,755
You promised me!

330
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,718
I want you to take a look at this photo.

331
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:57,795
I've seen this on the TV.
It's just a trick.

332
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,506
Lateef, I need you to work with me.

333
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,460
Look at this picture.

334
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:10,386
Who's this man standing
next to you, Lateef?

335
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,093
Anwar Hammersmith.

336
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,127
I know him from school.

337
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,176
What happened? Where did he go?

338
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:43,755
Jesus Christ.

339
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:48,802
He kicked me.
He went out the window!

340
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,300
He's fucking gone?

341
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,547
Come out.

342
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:32,589
Get behind me.

343
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:35,880
Open the door.

344
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:39,589
Stay behind me!

345
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:46,710
- I've been shot!
- To the stairs!

346
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:49,925
My leg!

347
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:54,714
Come on.

348
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:56,755
Come on, faster.

349
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:58,335
- You said I'd be safe.
- Come on.

350
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,172
Don't do that, Al.

351
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,094
I think I've unlocked a
source for a terrorist.

352
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:14,214
What?

353
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:16,511
I gave critical intel to a stranger.

354
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,127
He played me, Eric.

355
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,177
He had today's control code.
Today's encryption key.

356
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,423
Whoa, whoa, wait, just slow
down a second. Who?

357
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:26,460
Frank Sutter.

358
00:29:26,542 --> 00:29:28,215
At least that's what he called himself.

359
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:33,172
I thought he was with London station.
He asked me to interrogate a prisoner

360
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,254
who was carrying a message
from Imam Khaleel to David Mercer.

361
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:40,001
I was asked to acquire their
recognition protocol, which I did.

362
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,209
And?

363
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:42,635
Right after I broke him,

364
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:45,253
- I get a call from headquarters...
- Shh. Sit down.

365
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,218
Asking me to do exactly the same job.

366
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:49,506
There's no Frank Sutter in London station.

367
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:51,676
Let's... let's take care of this first.

368
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:55,136
- Who is this guy, Sutter?
- I have no idea.

369
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,879
And why did he hijack
a CIA interrogation?

370
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,960
For... for the protocol.

371
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:04,512
Whoever has it can speak for the imam.
And change the message.

372
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:10,747
Sir...

373
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:14,302
<i>does your prisoner happen
to be a 19-year-old.</i>

374
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,377
<i>British national of Moroccan descent?</i>

375
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,970
<i>Yes. What the fuck is going on?</i>

376
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,502
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

377
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:25,336
- Ed?
- No further contact.

378
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:28,753
How did she get to our prisoner?

379
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:31,131
Our London unit's running that down.

380
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:33,047
<i>They've traced the van.</i>

381
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:41,384
Secure perimeter.

382
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:46,669
All guardians down.

383
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:51,292
VIP missing. Clean work.
This was contracted.

384
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:57,132
Our guys must have been hit straight
after they snatched the courier. He's gone.

385
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:10,503
So, Sutter doesn't know the meet location.

386
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:13,219
He's only got part of the protocol.

387
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:17,296
Thank God I caught on
before I gave him everything.

388
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,547
What's he missing?

389
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:24,092
Enough. Or if he meets with Mercer,
he'll get blown.

390
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:26,552
Langley's gonna wanna bring you in,
you know that.

391
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:29,761
- Langley's been breached.
- Ag reed.

392
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:31,926
That's why you can't stay here.

393
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:35,837
If there's inside involvement,
they're gonna connect us.

394
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:41,047
Now you should change. Laura's still
got some clothes in the closet.

395
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:24,386
Stay down. Come on, stay down.

396
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,172
Oh, my God.

397
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,469
- I'll carry you.
- No, I can't move. I can't move.

398
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,673
105 Wildbriar.

399
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:47,545
- What?
- 105 Wildbriar.

400
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:48,922
Apartment 32.

401
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,253
It's a flat I got for
Laura when we separated.

402
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:56,542
There's a spare key in the hall
above the extinguishers.

403
00:32:57,583 --> 00:32:59,551
Go, she's not there.
You need a safe house.

404
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,835
Go! Go!

405
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:15,795
The timer, the propellant and a micro fan.

406
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:18,295
The propellant here contains the virus.

407
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,585
The fan'll disperse it into a mist,
too fine to see or feel.

408
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:31,715
A contained, crowded space is best.

409
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:35,344
Now I've set the timer to activate in...

410
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:37,676
10 seconds.

411
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:40,636
Once they're infected, it'll take a while.

412
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:44,208
- If you wanna come back later, I can show...
- I'll take your word for it.

413
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:56,505
Come on, get it.

414
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:00,635
Sorry, mate. Oh.

415
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:03,005
Come on, let's go.

416
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,547
Back inside.

417
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:44,585
- Move!
- All right.

418
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:47,090
Keep calm. No one has to get hurt.

419
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:51,094
Let's
not lose our heads.

420
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:54,340
I'll just pop the telly
back over here, then, eh?

421
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:09,505
Not that you'd care, but I only picked this
flat because your parking spot was empty.

422
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,794
You're robbing it?

423
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,270
Well, technically speaking, I haven't relieved
relieved you of anything just yet, have I?

424
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:19,128
Sit down. Hands where I can see them.

425
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:22,256
- So you can call the police?
- So you can not get shot.

426
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:25,009
That's always nice.

427
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,378
- There's nobody else here, love.
- Get up.

428
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:30,551
- You just told me to sit down.
- Stand up!

429
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:32,551
Yeah, standing.

430
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,794
Into the bedroom.

431
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:36,218
I like where this is going.

432
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,427
- What have you got in mind?
- I'm gonna restrain you.

433
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,047
My kinda girl.

434
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,160
Put your rucksack on the bed.

435
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,335
Sit down, by the machine.

436
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,798
Lay down. Face the floor.

437
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:52,800
Hands behind your back.

438
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,760
There are other ways to
get to know someone.

439
00:38:04,042 --> 00:38:05,134
Jack Alcott.

440
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:06,755
And you are?

441
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,879
Seriously, has someone broken your
heart recently?

442
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,342
'Cause not all men are alike.

443
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:21,964
Mmm.

444
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,870
<i>May I have your control code, please?</i>

445
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:36,671
Control code, zero, golf,
Charlie, four, four, two.

446
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:40,212
Encryption key, alpha,
November, alpha, nine.

447
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:43,421
I need to speak to my case
officer, it's urgent.

448
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:48,136
I've got Alice Racine on line six.

449
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,218
About fucking time.

450
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:51,839
The watch officer traced the call.

451
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:54,169
Do we have an ETA on our grab team?

452
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:56,715
The Brits had people closer.
We gave them the ball.

453
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:01,423
Alice, Bob Hunter,

454
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:03,050
Euro division chief.

455
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,798
I'm here with Ed Romley.

456
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:05,922
Where are you, Alice?

457
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:09,917
On a landline, so let's presume
we all know the answer to that question.

458
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,252
<i>- What's your status?
- In danger.</i>

459
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,756
- Someone is hunting me.
- Who?

460
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:18,336
Whoever had me interrogate your
prisoner at the hotel.

461
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:20,419
<i>- Were you successful?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

462
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,060
<i>- And the prisoner?</i>
<i>- Dead.</i>

463
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:23,759
Eric Lasch too.

464
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:27,585
Repeat that, please.

465
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,752
Eric Lasch is dead.

466
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:35,211
<i>After losing the kid at the hotel,
I went to his apartment.</i>

467
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:36,589
And we were hit there.

468
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,300
It's probably already been cleaned but you
should secure it as soon as possible.

469
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:43,922
Sir...

470
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:48,798
Frank Sutter, the man who contacted me...
They had yesterday's control codes.

471
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,047
You've been penetrated.

472
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:56,176
<i>I know you need to vet
what I just told you.</i>

473
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:59,211
And until you've done that
I'm to be considered a...

474
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,176
No one's thinking that way here, Alice.

475
00:41:04,292 --> 00:41:05,464
No.

476
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,592
Really?

477
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:08,839
<i>Alice?</i>

478
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:12,505
Did they get her?

479
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:14,419
Find out.

480
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:23,127
Stay out of trouble, Jack.

481
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:34,676
Go, go: Go!

482
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:47,044
Can I see some ID, please?

483
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:53,669
Guns on the table.

484
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:57,255
Easy with that.

485
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:18,631
Alpha five, target acquired.

486
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:48,134
Ah.

487
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,127
I'm so gonna regret this.

488
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:00,631
<i>How the hell could you miss her?</i>

489
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:04,053
Do you really want to go there?

490
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:13,803
You ran an illegal op on my soil,

491
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,507
and when it all goes sideways,
you come crying.

492
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:18,381
- Emily...
- MI5's not your mother.

493
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:21,507
<i>Yes, you're right.
Do you know how I know that, Emily?</i>

494
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:25,463
Because my mother could have
handled the fucking grab!

495
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:29,797
Racine had help.

496
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,547
Who?

497
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,672
We're working on it.

498
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:35,130
Beautiful.

499
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,377
<i>She's your stray, Bob.</i>

500
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,934
<i>And it would have been helpful
if you'd brought us in sooner.</i>

501
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:44,919
"Sooner" we couldn't reach her. "Sooner",
we thought we controlled her sooner.

502
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:46,209
Oh, come on.

503
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,047
You actually think she's turned?

504
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:49,380
She called you.

505
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:51,342
I'm aware of that.

506
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:54,961
<i>By the way, has it been ruled out?</i>

507
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:56,835
<i>- What?
- Her breach theory?</i>

508
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:58,967
<i>We're working on it.</i>

509
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:00,672
Beautiful.

510
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:02,714
<i>Bye bye.</i>

511
00:44:08,917 --> 00:44:09,964
<i>(Jack grunts';</i>

512
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:18,755
Morning, love.

513
00:44:32,792 --> 00:44:33,884
Why'd you help me?

514
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,128
I wasn't gonna find any jewellery
and that IV was crap.

515
00:44:40,292 --> 00:44:41,669
I heard everything.

516
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,923
Your little phone call. Bedside phone.

517
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:47,259
You heard?

518
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:50,633
Everything. Sounds like there's some
serious shit about to go down.

519
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:53,348
I couldn't just leave you there, could I?

520
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:55,965
Well, most people would have.

521
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,629
Most people didn't lose their best mate
in the 7/7 Tube bombing.

522
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:03,044
I'm sorry.

523
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:04,547
Yeah, well, what're you gonna do?

524
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:12,128
- So, who trained you?
- I play video games.

525
00:45:15,917 --> 00:45:19,672
Marines. Four tours. Iraq.

526
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:28,256
Well, those were SCO19s
that you messed with,

527
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:31,268
which means that our governments
are already talking to each other.

528
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:33,294
Oh, really? About what?

529
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:34,839
It's classified.

530
00:45:37,083 --> 00:45:39,211
Didn't I just get you out of
a whole heap of trouble?

531
00:45:39,292 --> 00:45:40,384
You have my gratitude.

532
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:42,802
I'll trade your goodwill and appreciation

533
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:45,674
for what the fuck is going on in London
that involves the CIA,

534
00:45:45,792 --> 00:45:47,886
dead prisoners and a terror strike?

535
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:50,130
Goodbye, Jack.

536
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:53,052
Bad idea, shedding me. I heard too much.

537
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,468
I'm an unknown variable now.

538
00:45:57,333 --> 00:45:59,756
Tactically, it's a no-brainer.

539
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:02,884
You really want me around.

540
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,297
I'm useful.

541
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:07,714
And I like trouble.

542
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:15,630
Good bye.

543
00:46:16,417 --> 00:46:17,684
You're saying the stakes
aren't high enough?

544
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:18,800
Oh, they are high enough.

545
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:20,047
Well, then.

546
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:23,172
I can help you.

547
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,756
I've had my troubles since the war.

548
00:46:28,875 --> 00:46:30,343
Clearly not so well-adjusted.

549
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:35,425
But I'm combat tested, and right now...

550
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:39,252
I'm thinking I'm the only friend you got.

551
00:46:44,208 --> 00:46:45,960
- Go home, Jack.
- I am home.

552
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:48,714
Where the fuck are you? Any idea?

553
00:47:03,042 --> 00:47:04,589
- This is all of 'em?
- It is, yes.

554
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:06,010
Sir. Sir.

555
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:07,300
The kills were top-tier.

556
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:11,334
Single shooter from 80 yards.
The rounds were armour piercing.

557
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:14,344
- Lab in Bexley is running analysis.
- What's wrong with our lab?

558
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:17,921
A pouch to DC delays us 12 hours,
and if the point is to clear Alice,

559
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,047
then we can...

560
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:21,628
She was the last person to see
the courier alive.

561
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,674
And she's actively evading
a post-incident debrief.

562
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:28,675
Until that changes, clearing her
is nowhere near the point.

563
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:39,301
Here we are. This all right?

564
00:47:40,542 --> 00:47:42,662
- Thank you.
- That's £12.50, please.

565
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:54,210
Hello, madame. Ls Amjad home?

566
00:47:54,292 --> 00:47:55,464
There's no Amjad here.

567
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:57,089
It's okay, Mum. It's okay.

568
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,426
- She's a friend from the centre.
- Hey.

569
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,252
- How are you?
- I'm good. You?

570
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:03,085
Yeah, good.
Hey, sweetie.

571
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:07,252
Oh, wow. Look at you. You're so big now.

572
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:09,381
- How old are you?
- Three.

573
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:12,007
Oh. No wonder you're so heavy.

574
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:15,882
- Where's your daddy?
- He's playing football. Amjad!

575
00:48:16,417 --> 00:48:18,010
- Hey!
- There he is.

576
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:20,130
Sorry about my mum.

577
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:22,218
She's visiting from Bristol.

578
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:25,170
She's so paranoid,
always thinking it's Immigration.

579
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,547
My brother got sent back last year.

580
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:29,047
Yeah, I know.

581
00:48:30,042 --> 00:48:31,089
Who's that guy?

582
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:33,634
He's okay.

583
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:37,101
I heard that Egyptian thing
turned out to be nothing.

584
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,377
Glad you told me though.

585
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,214
So what's the deal today?

586
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:42,464
Well...

587
00:48:50,667 --> 00:48:52,635
So he has friends inside Khaleel's mosque.

588
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:54,797
He's handy.

589
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:02,381
Hoxton High Street.
Some Moroccan restaurant.

590
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:04,426
The imam eats lunch there most days.

591
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,592
I love a tagine.

592
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:08,420
- Still time.
- Get the bus? Tube?

593
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:10,377
The lady doesn't do public transport.

594
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:12,760
What? I gotta d...

595
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:14,975
One sec, let me just talk to them, yeah?

596
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:21,718
I'm going now.

597
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,840
I'll see you later, yeah.

598
00:49:24,792 --> 00:49:27,796
<i>Tuesday's American football
game at Wembley is sold out.</i>

599
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:29,684
<i>And their many fans at home
couldn't be more excited.</i>

600
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:31,426
<i>Many of them crossing the pond...</i>

601
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:33,835
It's like rugby for hairdressers, mate.

602
00:49:33,917 --> 00:49:34,964
I don't know about you,

603
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:38,226
but the last time I saw shoulder pads like
that was on reruns of Dallas.

604
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,850
Now let's talk about
the beautiful game we call "soccer".

605
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:42,184
Shut up, both of you.

606
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:43,585
Faster, please.

607
00:49:49,417 --> 00:49:51,260
<i>- Knowles</i> here.
<i>- Emily, it's Alice.</i>

608
00:49:51,917 --> 00:49:53,885
Alice? Do you know where I've been all day?

609
00:49:54,042 --> 00:49:56,420
Whitehall, at the Cobra meeting.

610
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,094
- Guessing my name came up, huh?
- More than once.

611
00:49:59,167 --> 00:50:00,840
<i>Well, don't believe everything you hear.</i>

612
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:01,964
Oh, give me some credit.

613
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:03,715
<i>Why do you think I'm calling you?</i>

614
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,295
MI5's committing every available asset
to this.

615
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:08,593
<i>All conceivable soft targets
are being assessed.</i>

616
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:11,876
Well, there's no time for guessing.
I'm chasing a lead and I need your help.

617
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:13,460
What do you have in mind?

618
00:50:13,542 --> 00:50:16,386
<i>The courier was waiting for a text
with the meet location.</i>

619
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:18,131
<i>We need to find his phone.</i>

620
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:27,510
Just the one, please.

621
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,718
This way. Please.

622
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,718
Am I all right here?

623
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:43,295
Round guy, short beard. Prayer cap.

624
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:45,503
If he comes out, watch which way he goes.

625
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:46,863
Watch which way he goes. Got it.

626
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:47,964
- Okay.
- Yeah.

627
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:53,798
Hey, watch out, man.

628
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:01,960
Mr Al-Hussein?

629
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:03,134
Yes.

630
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:05,631
I'm Alice from the Gold Crescent
Community Centre.

631
00:51:05,708 --> 00:51:08,837
Have you by any chance seen
Lateef el Hajjam recently?

632
00:51:08,917 --> 00:51:10,510
I believe you know him from the mosque.

633
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:12,797
Lateef el Hajjam?

634
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,675
I'm sad to say that, um, some of his
friends got into trouble with the police.

635
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,127
Vandalism. Graffiti.

636
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:19,794
And his name came up.

637
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:21,505
That's terrible.

638
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:23,677
We mentor troubled youth

639
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,924
and we often act as an advocate
with the police in such matters.

640
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,549
And, um, Lateef's mother
asked for our help.

641
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:33,586
- His mother, you say?
- That's right.

642
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:36,593
His mother spoke to you?

643
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,422
Yeah, just now.

644
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:41,086
It's quite urgent that I find her son.

645
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,052
- Will you excuse me a second?
- Sure.

646
00:51:52,583 --> 00:51:53,630
Thank you.

647
00:51:59,292 --> 00:52:01,511
Hey, it's me. We're on.

648
00:52:02,042 --> 00:52:03,294
Right.

649
00:52:15,375 --> 00:52:18,345
Eight outgoing calls from grid Q34.

650
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:21,507
Seven of them listed.
One pay-as-you-go.

651
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:23,506
That's him.
Find the phone he's calling.

652
00:52:24,792 --> 00:52:25,839
Triangulating.

653
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:29,424
London. Grid Q22.

654
00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:31,794
Another no-contract phone.

655
00:52:32,792 --> 00:52:34,760
Stationary. Hackney.

656
00:52:35,417 --> 00:52:37,840
Either a car park or a car pound.

657
00:53:03,292 --> 00:53:04,339
Can I help you?

658
00:53:04,667 --> 00:53:06,761
- Yeah, I'm looking for the gents.
- Behind you.

659
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,302
Silly me. I'm a head-banger.

660
00:53:17,542 --> 00:53:20,341
Now behave yourselves, all right?

661
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,343
Both of you.

662
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:35,755
CIA.

663
00:53:55,542 --> 00:53:56,542
This courier?

664
00:53:57,583 --> 00:53:58,675
Maybe he's not mine.

665
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:02,300
Lateef el Hajjam. He carried your
instructions for David Mercer.

666
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:05,135
Do you know an American named Sutter?

667
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,300
No.

668
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,877
He kidnapped Lateef.

669
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:11,633
And he tricked me into getting him the
information he needed to gain Mercer's trust.

670
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:13,502
A fatwa by Ali.

671
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:16,593
- Sutter, was it?
- Mmm-hmm.

672
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:21,048
Did he ask you to get my instructions
for Mercer?

673
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,674
No. He just asked for the protocol.

674
00:54:25,542 --> 00:54:28,716
- He has his own messenger?
- Apparently, yes.

675
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:32,922
What was yours?

676
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:37,011
"My dearest brother in Islam,"

677
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:40,675
"look to the fatwa for guidance."

678
00:54:41,125 --> 00:54:45,551
"In Ali's wisdom, my wishes are clear."

679
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:49,169
You remember it, don't you? The fatwa?

680
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:52,629
"A person has no faith
if he has no patience."

681
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,089
What's that?

682
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,469
- A stand-down order?
- Uh-huh.

683
00:55:01,042 --> 00:55:02,919
You did not order an attack?

684
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,047
You're shocked.

685
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:06,878
- You're not known for your restraint.
- Neither is America.

686
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:08,255
Not when threatened, no.

687
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:10,002
Ah, so you know the feeling?

688
00:55:11,167 --> 00:55:12,589
Here's a hypothetical.

689
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,423
Say an imam

690
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,549
is sickened by what's happening
to his religion.

691
00:55:19,667 --> 00:55:24,093
Group after group hijacking it,
each more savage than the next.

692
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:27,712
But, say, as a younger man,
his rage at the West consumed him.

693
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:30,875
And for years, he was lost in the hate.

694
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,344
But... He's done with that now?

695
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:38,007
This made-up imam of yours?

696
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,752
And, thus, his dilemma.

697
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:48,711
If he walks away now, his influence ends.

698
00:55:49,208 --> 00:55:53,213
Mass killers seek this man's counsel.

699
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:56,666
And, with a word, he stops them.

700
00:55:56,792 --> 00:55:58,214
But not this time.

701
00:55:58,292 --> 00:56:01,011
- Then next time.
- I'm not here for the next time.

702
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:02,884
What's the target?

703
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:06,208
- I don't know. Each link is separate.
- But the meet?

704
00:56:06,542 --> 00:56:08,260
At least you must know the meet?

705
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:10,836
That rule is never broken, Alice.

706
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:13,840
Mercer, when he's ready,

707
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:15,840
will contact my messenger.

708
00:56:15,917 --> 00:56:19,626
And we are all in God's hands then.

709
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:24,302
I like to think we have a say.

710
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:30,255
Where the hell is he?

711
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:35,751
Hello.

712
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:37,210
Hey, it's me. Where are you?

713
00:56:37,292 --> 00:56:39,966
<i>The other side of the park.
It's the tallest building.</i>

714
00:56:40,042 --> 00:56:41,510
<i>I followed your man here.</i>

715
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:54,173
- Morning, ma'am. This way.
- Hiya.

716
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:57,541
The moped was found
abandoned in a tunnel two nights ago.

717
00:57:13,167 --> 00:57:14,635
I didn't tell you to follow him.

718
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:17,507
You didn't tell me not to.
Flat 1906.

719
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,173
- What?
- You stay here. And keep watch.

720
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:24,672
You heard the lady.

721
00:57:25,583 --> 00:57:26,755
You're welcome.

722
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:31,684
Any of you got a spare cigarette?
Got a spare one?

723
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:33,585
- Yeah, 'course, bruv.
- Safe.

724
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:47,002
Emily?

725
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:49,051
<i>Turn around, Alice, we've got it.</i>

726
00:57:49,458 --> 00:57:51,586
- Come again?
- We <i>found</i> the phone.

727
00:57:51,875 --> 00:57:54,674
The courier's been pinged.
A coded sequence was sent through.

728
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:56,218
We have the meet site.

729
00:57:56,583 --> 00:57:59,211
<i>Six o'clock.
Brent Cross boathouse.</i>

730
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:00,839
<i>Well done, Alice.</i>

731
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,970
- So we're ditching this guy, then?
- We don't need him now.

732
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:14,925
The meet is on. About three hours.
A boathouse in Brent Cross.

733
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,628
- That's big news, right?
- Yeah

734
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:22,713
I gotta say, this beats a sandstorm
in Helmand province, hands down.

735
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:29,209
Helmand province?
That's in Afghanistan?

736
00:58:29,792 --> 00:58:31,214
Hmm?

737
00:58:31,292 --> 00:58:32,885
You said you served in Iraq.

738
00:58:33,958 --> 00:58:37,383
Oh, I was on the ground in both wars.
I forget to mention it.

739
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,047
Hmm.

740
00:58:40,292 --> 00:58:42,386
Soldiers don't forget their deployments.

741
00:58:43,167 --> 00:58:44,214
Who are you?

742
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:49,926
You're joking, right?

743
00:58:54,708 --> 00:58:55,834
Jack Alcott.

744
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:58,628
40 Commando Royal Marines,
Helmand Task Force.

745
00:59:00,292 --> 00:59:04,627
We forced a hardpoint for
three straight days in Operation Musa Qala.

746
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:07,801
To you, I'm just another wrong'un.

747
00:59:08,917 --> 00:59:12,171
The nine JSOC operators that owe me
their lives...

748
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:15,129
Well, they might disagree.

749
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,547
Happy'?

750
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:23,130
What's next?

751
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:25,630
Next...

752
00:59:26,292 --> 00:59:27,714
We part company.

753
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,092
Alice...

754
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:31,217
I am telling the truth.

755
00:59:33,375 --> 00:59:36,094
You're selling the truth. Face the wall.

756
00:59:40,667 --> 00:59:41,919
Get back inside!

757
01:00:03,917 --> 01:00:06,887
About three hours.
A boathouse in Brent Cross.</i>

758
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:14,592
Come on.

759
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:19,461
Up We go. Up We go.

760
01:00:19,542 --> 01:00:21,670
All right, darling. All right.

761
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:29,090
Helmand fucking Province.

762
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:32,010
Always comes down to
tradecraft, doesn't it?

763
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:35,211
- Beware of the short-notice gigs.
- You too.

764
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,717
No kidding.

765
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:38,478
Shame it had to be you, really.

766
01:00:38,917 --> 01:00:40,214
- Why?
- 'Cause I like you.

767
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:44,086
- Quite like to have had your back.
- It's never too late.

768
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:46,090
To what?

769
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:48,255
Run away together?

770
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,968
Let you put a bullet in my back?

771
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:56,881
No. Quick recce and scoot.
In and out, that's the job.

772
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:01,959
- Mercer's recognition protocol?
- There you go.

773
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:05,674
It'll go easy on us both
if you give it to me now.

774
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:08,756
We both know it's never gonna happen.

775
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:11,131
Well, we both know what happens
if you don't.

776
01:01:13,167 --> 01:01:14,214
Come on.

777
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:18,212
Do you really think I wanna bleed you out
in the car park? 'Cause I don't.

778
01:01:18,917 --> 01:01:20,294
But I will.

779
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:34,292
Lovely dogs.
What are they? Rottweilers?

780
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:07,801
Motherfucker!

781
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:09,751
Well played.

782
01:02:10,792 --> 01:02:13,921
Brought your fucking A-game, eh?

783
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,640
You're not gonna make this easy, are you?

784
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:21,006
I am definitely earning my keep today.

785
01:02:27,167 --> 01:02:29,295
Give me the fucking protocol, Alice!

786
01:02:36,208 --> 01:02:38,586
Oh, what a fucking shame.
In a different world...

787
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:42,007
In a parallel fucking universe,
it doesn't come to this.

788
01:02:43,917 --> 01:02:45,385
But we live in this one.

789
01:02:53,417 --> 01:02:54,464
FUCK you!

790
01:03:01,167 --> 01:03:02,544
Cop a bit of this!

791
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:30,589
<i>Knowles?</i>

792
01:03:30,667 --> 01:03:32,635
- Emily.
- Dr Adam Roizman, Public Health.

793
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:34,210
We spoke on the phone.

794
01:03:34,292 --> 01:03:37,216
We were told Five's chasing
a threat and to loop you in on this.

795
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,128
Now the mother rang 999.

796
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:42,005
Frantic, as you can imagine.

797
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:46,719
Thanks to her we were able to isolate
him quickly.

798
01:03:55,792 --> 01:03:57,009
Oh, God.

799
01:04:01,333 --> 01:04:03,552
<i>He responded positive to Marburg.</i>

800
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:07,050
<i>Incubation was fast, so we're dealing
with a mutation, probably.</i>

801
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:11,710
<i>Symptoms in adults, two to five days.
And in children, even faster.</i>

802
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:16,417
Now, if this is Mercer,
and he got it from the Soviet stockpile

803
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,549
then it's a virus designed to be sturdy.

804
01:04:19,625 --> 01:04:22,674
It will last between lab and host,

805
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:27,085
which puts in play our worst fear,
aerosolised distribution.

806
01:04:28,667 --> 01:04:30,169
Alice? Are you listening?

807
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:38,837
Five has no Arabic-speaking
18-year-olds on staff.

808
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,127
By the time we
could scramble one together...

809
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:43,085
- He's a kid, Emily.
- Exactly.

810
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:45,169
Khaleel's couriers are always kids.

811
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:48,958
It's a good plan, Alice.
Mercer won't know he's ours.

812
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:51,878
He'll deliver the original
stand-down message.

813
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:54,461
Mercer will pull the plug
and we'll start making arrests.

814
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:57,252
He's had no training.

815
01:04:57,958 --> 01:04:59,255
I recruited him.

816
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:04,088
- If I knew it'd come to this...
- I know. But you didn't.

817
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:06,755
And it has.

818
01:05:12,042 --> 01:05:13,259
Ah, this is sick.

819
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:16,253
I can't wait to tell my mates about this,
and see the look on their faces.

820
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:17,934
- You can't.
- Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

821
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:19,893
I'm just saying, this is
like bad arse, isn't it?

822
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:21,309
Well, can somebody take my picture
with them?

823
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:22,380
No.

824
01:05:23,042 --> 01:05:24,339
What's that, a HK?

825
01:05:24,417 --> 01:05:27,546
- Oh, my days, I thought you only used those...
- Hey, hey, hey. Focus.

826
01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:32,546
Let's run it again. I'm Mercer.

827
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:53,084
Good.

828
01:05:53,167 --> 01:05:55,215
Good? That was perfect, man.

829
01:05:55,292 --> 01:05:56,464
Look, this guy's mine, baby.

830
01:05:56,708 --> 01:05:59,006
I got this. He's mine. I got this.

831
01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:02,792
We'll have three watchers on you,
with video feeds to the van.

832
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:05,760
- What's that?
- It's an earpiece.

833
01:06:07,792 --> 01:06:09,044
So you can hear us.

834
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:10,797
'- Okay?

835
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:14,295
Okay, gentlemen.
We're going live in 30 minutes.

836
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:15,592
How's the feed to HQ?

837
01:06:15,667 --> 01:06:16,714
- Fine.
- Good.

838
01:06:41,792 --> 01:06:44,591
- How are you doing out there, Amjad?
- Cold.

839
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,510
<i>- When's something happening?
- Anytime now.</i>

840
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:48,256
<i>Yeah, you can just say you don't know.</i>

841
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:51,218
Alice, can I have a word?

842
01:06:59,792 --> 01:07:01,635
MI6 has a file on you, you know.

843
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:04,673
I got a peek at our Cobra meeting.

844
01:07:05,458 --> 01:07:06,630
Something juicy?

845
01:07:07,542 --> 01:07:08,942
Other than Paris, you mean?

846
01:07:10,167 --> 01:07:11,714
The bridge bombing was tragic.

847
01:07:12,292 --> 01:07:15,262
Not just because Algerian terrorists
killed a lot of people that day.

848
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:17,476
If there's something you wanna tell me,
Emily, just tell me.

849
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,127
Lam telling you.

850
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:29,173
After the bombing,
France's DGSI launched an inquiry.

851
01:07:30,875 --> 01:07:32,218
A magistrate put the seal on it.

852
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,003
There were leaks
that made it into MI6's report.

853
01:07:35,417 --> 01:07:36,464
Leaks saying what?

854
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:39,216
Well, among other things,
there was a discrepancy.

855
01:07:40,042 --> 01:07:44,502
Between the time you broke the prisoner and
the time the French police were alerted.

856
01:07:45,708 --> 01:07:46,834
Do I have your attention?

857
01:07:48,125 --> 01:07:51,550
Ninety minutes.
More than enough time to stop the bombing.

858
01:07:53,625 --> 01:07:56,424
Someone at the CIA wanted it to happen.

859
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:00,799
The French pressed Langley,
but they were unresponsive.

860
01:08:01,542 --> 01:08:03,294
Just as they were unresponsive when asked

861
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:06,584
if a CIA employee was among those killed
on the bridge that day.

862
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:08,635
<i>A whistleblower, it turns out.</i>

863
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:11,427
<i>With access
to drone strike after-action reports.</i>

864
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:14,629
He was about to reveal CIA's
mathematical inadequacies.

865
01:08:15,167 --> 01:08:17,295
- Make them public.
- Civilian deaths?

866
01:08:19,875 --> 01:08:22,344
The numbers were being slashed, routinely.

867
01:08:22,417 --> 01:08:24,590
Hundreds of reports altered.

868
01:08:26,042 --> 01:08:28,340
- Are you okay, Alice?
- Yeah.

869
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:31,878
- Do you want to sit down?
- No, I don't want to sit down!

870
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:34,552
I wanna know how good this intel is.

871
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:37,380
Six trusts its source.

872
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:40,217
I'm sorry.

873
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:43,344
I can only imagine the burden
of those deaths,

874
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:46,301
but it was never yours to carry.

875
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:03,843
Prelim analysis is back.

876
01:09:03,917 --> 01:09:06,545
The kidnappers used an A300 Win Mag round

877
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:11,005
fired from an AT308C sniper rifle
with suppressor.

878
01:09:11,417 --> 01:09:13,511
It's a speciality armament.
Very few produced.

879
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:18,089
The manufacturer has an exclusive contract
with Britain's intelligence services.

880
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:19,887
Are you saying that the shooter is English?

881
01:09:19,917 --> 01:09:22,716
No. He's saying start calling
their armouries now.

882
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:28,509
Punch in on the dock.

883
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:31,381
Watcher Two, go in on the dock times five.

884
01:09:32,542 --> 01:09:34,062
Pan <i>left</i> then <i>down.</i>

885
01:09:36,917 --> 01:09:38,590
There. You see that?

886
01:09:39,292 --> 01:09:40,714
It's the electrical line.

887
01:09:40,917 --> 01:09:42,760
Did your men sweep under the dock?

888
01:09:45,375 --> 01:09:46,922
Oh, Jesus, Emily.

889
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:49,006
- That could be a det cord.
- Alice!

890
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:50,130
Shit.

891
01:09:55,417 --> 01:09:58,546
Watcher team, be advised, there is a
friendly about to cross your perimeter.

892
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:00,218
<i>I repeat, a friendly.</i>

893
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:12,673
This is Commander MacPhee, MPS, London.

894
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,923
You wanted a manifest check of my armoury?

895
01:10:15,042 --> 01:10:17,761
Er, yes, Commander. We were wondering
if you had some information...

896
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:20,837
If I have any AT308 Charlie sniper rifles
currently in the field?

897
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:23,051
Right. We have reason to believe that...

898
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:24,217
<i>Just one.</i>

899
01:10:24,292 --> 01:10:28,843
<i>Checked out and properly signed for by
a 12-year veteran of the security service.</i>

900
01:10:28,917 --> 01:10:30,919

- That's right. MI5.</i>

901

01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,507
Affirmative. All's good here.

913
01:11:42,083 --> 01:11:43,756
It's clear.

914

No, please, no.

922
01:13:19,167 --> 01:13:23,217

You're late.

930
01:16:48,417 --> 01:16:49,839
Mercer was late.

931
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:54,255
- He's been given the go order.
- I know. But we got a problem.

932
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,253
<i>This is wrong.
I can't do it.</i>

933
01:16:59,083 --> 01:17:01,962
- I can't do it.
- You must, my son.

934
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:03,752
God has willed it.

935
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:05,130
<i>But children too?</i>

936
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:06,926

And when they grow up, they will too.</i>

938

- We have the imam's blessing.</i>

939
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:15,630
Be strong, my son.

940
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:18,047
Start the timers.

941
01:17:19,917 --> 01:17:22,716
This is wrong. I can't do it.

942
01:17:22,792 --> 01:17:26,251
- I got this.
- Whoa. I got somebody closer.

943
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:29,684
<i>Start the timers, or you will
answer to Allah for all eternity!</i>

944
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:33,758
Please. Please. I can't. I just...

945
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:55,344
This is for your heavy work.

946
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:58,585
Only for the Moroccan kid.

947
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:00,630
We still owe you Racine.

948
01:18:01,417 --> 01:18:02,509
Why is that?

949
01:18:02,708 --> 01:18:04,085
Because they missed.

950
01:18:05,667 --> 01:18:09,171
- Hey, Al, we was in here talking about you.
- Shut up!

951
01:18:11,792 --> 01:18:13,544
So you still owe him, hmm?

952
01:18:14,208 --> 01:18:15,460
Here I am.

953
01:18:22,042 --> 01:18:23,760
You piece of shit.

954
01:18:24,583 --> 01:18:27,632
- Once the surprise wears off, Al...
- You played me.

955
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:30,467
That will never wear off.

956
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:34,711
- Get up.
- Or what?

957
01:18:41,292 --> 01:18:44,045
Or your next death won't be a staged one.

958
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:45,172
Get up!

959
01:18:45,833 --> 01:18:47,380
On your feet.

960
01:18:51,417 --> 01:18:52,634
Tell me the target.

961
01:18:53,583 --> 01:18:54,880
Don't insult me.

962
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:01,631
How did you know the imam was blocking
terror strikes?

963
01:19:03,125 --> 01:19:06,925
Because too many of his meetings had
had benign outcomes.

964
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,504
- So you snatched his messenger?
- And teed up your entrance.

965
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,720
It was a decent plan till
things went sideways.

966
01:19:20,833 --> 01:19:23,586
I'd been briefed, of course.
Knew you'd escaped the hotel.

967
01:19:23,958 --> 01:19:27,713
Knew I had incomplete information,
so I improvised.

968
01:19:30,083 --> 01:19:32,461
I'm getting too old for this shit.

969
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:38,508
- And I put someone on you.
- Jack. He was good.

970
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:42,167
- I have an eye for talent.
- Yeah. You mentored me.

971
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:44,799
I trained you in the country's interest.

972
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:48,050
I know about Paris.

973
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,209
- What... What about Paris?
- Paris, you fuck!

974
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:03,377
Traitors...

975
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:05,835
Need to be taken out.

976
01:20:05,917 --> 01:20:08,716
Traitors? You murdered 24 people.

977
01:20:08,792 --> 01:20:10,965
An Algerian suicide bomber did.

978
01:20:11,042 --> 01:20:12,259
Six were children!

979
01:20:12,625 --> 01:20:14,798
He was a threat to national security!

980
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:16,798
He was a fellow CIA officer.

981
01:20:17,542 --> 01:20:19,340
You ordered him to the bridge.

982
01:20:19,417 --> 01:20:21,169
A target I acquired for you.

983
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,048
All this time you let me think...

984
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:29,095
Haven't I always said to you, Al,
it wasn't your fault?

985
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:31,085
I'm so stupid.

986
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:33,676
That's why you chose me again.

987
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:35,585
No, no, you're a clutch player, Al.

988
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:39,251
And whenever it matters...
You sink that three-pointer.

989
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:42,084
The target?

990
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,343
I said, don't insult me.

991
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:53,252
The fucking target, Eric!

992
01:21:21,333 --> 01:21:22,505
What's going on?

993
01:21:24,583 --> 01:21:26,881
- Who are you?
- Take a walk.

994
01:21:31,208 --> 01:21:32,551
Hey!

995
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:34,835

<i>Now put your hands together...</i>

1004
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:35,835
The timers are device-sensitive,

1005
01:22:36,542 --> 01:22:39,341
so you can only arm
and disarm them from this.

1006
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:42,335
Once armed, you've got five minutes.

1007
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:48,047
- How are we looking now?
- You tell me, sir.

1008
01:23:09,917 --> 01:23:11,590

I suppose that's loaded now?

1012

Uh-huh.

1013
01:24:22,833 --> 01:24:24,050
Why are you doing this?

1014
01:24:24,583 --> 01:24:28,258
Math. Lives lost versus lives saved.

1015
01:24:28,542 --> 01:24:30,715
- That simple, huh?
- Always.

1016
01:24:31,417 --> 01:24:34,011
Even if it takes going the extra distance.

1017
01:24:34,958 --> 01:24:36,380
How far is that?

1018
01:24:38,167 --> 01:24:39,510
Tell me how to stop it.

1019
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:41,551
You can't. It's a timed detonation.

01:24:46,167 --> 01:24:48,261
Attagirl.

1021
01:24:49,292 --> 01:24:50,418
How many dead?

1022
01:24:51,333 --> 01:24:53,006
Enough to get our attention.

1023
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:55,381
Global viruses are the biggest threat
to mankind

1024
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:57,210
and Washington is asleep, Al.

1025
01:24:57,542 --> 01:24:58,885
It's an American affliction.

1026
01:24:58,958 --> 01:25:02,337
You know, they truck-bombed
the World Trade Centre in '93,

1027
01:25:02,417 --> 01:25:05,421
but it takes 9/11 to make an impression.

1028
01:25:05,958 --> 01:25:10,714
Ebola hops across the Atlantic
but we ignored that warning too.

1029
01:25:11,333 --> 01:25:13,586
Some kind of sick wake-up call?

1030
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:17,542
No. I'd call it a stress test
of America's bio defence.

1031
01:25:17,625 --> 01:25:22,335
Those American guests next door are gonna
fly back to Oregon or to Oklahoma,

1032
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:24,260
each one of them a ticking bomb.

1033
01:25:24,667 --> 01:25:29,753
And when they go off, Washington will
appreciate its staggering lack of preparation.

1034
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:32,377
And do what exactly?

1035
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:34,926
Legalise what's needed for the next time.

1036
01:25:35,583 --> 01:25:37,927
Forced isolation of all contacts.

1037
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,719
Quarantine camps
and the troops to secure them.

1038
01:25:40,792 --> 01:25:43,636
Real-time access to
private medical records.

1039
01:25:43,708 --> 01:25:46,427
You're talking about medical martial law.

1040
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,424
I'm talking about keeping up
with Mother Nature,

1041
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:53,130
with her speed, with the tricks that
she's learned over millions of years.

1042
01:26:06,542 --> 01:26:07,759
Run, sir!

1043
01:26:54,833 --> 01:26:56,301
How far, you ask?

1044
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,174
As far as it takes to protect my country.

1045
01:28:17,917 --> 01:28:20,011
Officer Racine? For you.

1046
01:28:31,667 --> 01:28:35,251
<i>- Sir.
- Lasch's car pinged</i> a <i>traffic camera.</i>

1047
01:28:35,333 --> 01:28:37,381
<i>Our English friends looped us in.</i>

1048
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:41,003
- He had to be stopped.
- Yeah.

1049
01:28:44,208 --> 01:28:45,505
So, um...

1050
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:48,085
I suppose you're gonna bring me in now.

1051
01:28:48,167 --> 01:28:50,636
And I'd suppose you'd like an apology.

1052
01:28:50,708 --> 01:28:54,884
Here's an idea, let's get both and get
to work. Mercer's gone to ground.

1053
01:28:55,292 --> 01:28:58,091
<i>And I do not intend to let him stay there.</i>

1054
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:00,089
Do you?

1055
01:29:02,958 --> 01:29:05,928
- Sir, do you still want me to...
- Answer the question, Alice.

1056
01:29:10,042 --> 01:29:11,385
<i>Alice?</i>

1057
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:14,547
Yeah.

1058
01:29:15,250 --> 01:29:18,834
Um... He'll escape to Syria.

1059
01:29:19,458 --> 01:29:23,713
<i>Probably through Eastern Europe.
Network contacts will move him.</i>

1060
01:29:23,792 --> 01:29:25,385
<i>Our thinking as well.</i>

1061
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:27,467
I'll be in touch.

1062
01:31:47,292 --> 01:31:49,294
- Hey.
- Hey.

1063
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:53,254
We have time for a coffee.
There's a pastry shop by the river.

1064
01:31:54,042 --> 01:31:55,794
Excellent strudel.

1065
01:31:59,875 --> 01:32:01,252
Nice to have you back, Alice.

1066
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:05,426
Don't be a stranger.

1067
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:07,650
