1
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,473
City people think they're smart
but their brains are in the wrong place.

2
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,510
Yeah, they don’t
even get simple things...

3
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,440
How did they find out
that we're doing the healing ritual?

4
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:43,405
I don’t care if they film the ritual.

5
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,320
But the joke is, the want us to act it out.

6
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:47,445
That’s just plain stupid.

7
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,278
Well, maybe we should just do it.

8
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,319
Let them have a taste of
what the spirits are really like.

9
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,353
Fools. You cant mess
around with the spirits.

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,357
Its not like what you see on TV.
They are looking for trouble.

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,473
So, what’s the story
with that land on the beach?

12
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,472
Hey, isn’t that Pekin Ibrahim?

13
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,273
I don’t know. But that’s Faizal Hussein.
Him, I know.

14
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,520
Give me two or three days,
and ill settle it for you. Don’t worry.

15
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:01,318
Ill take over your debt.

16
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,360
Isn’t that Zahiril Adzim?

17
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:03,473
Its sorted.

18
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,513
The generators dying. The powers
going to cut. Were watching TV here.

19
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,475
Enough?

20
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,430
Yes.

21
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,365
How long has it been?

22
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,391
He’s been sick for some time.

23
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,416
He’s possessed by the
spirits of the shadow puppets.

24
00:03:26,451 --> 00:03:29,392
Have you prepared everything?
Everything’s in place.

25
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,433
What about the healers and the musicians for it?
They are ready and waiting.

26
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,389
Ill need to ask Boss.

27
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,476
Alright, you ask him. Just a second.

28
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,431
Looking for Boss?

29
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,835
He just left.

30
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,351
Is Deng around?

31
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,436
Over there. Hang on.

32
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,358
That guy over there...

33
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,836
I saw him. Who let him in?

34
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,273
He’s looking for fighters.

35
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,432
What if he’s a cop?
If Pinoy knows, you're dead.

36
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,270
He’s from Kelantan.

37
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,436
Whatever. Go watch the door.

38
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,280
We got screwed today. How about you?

39
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:40,271
Business as usual.

40
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,277
What’s the story, Deng?

41
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,516
Bunga Lalang. He had a debt
to settle with Pinoy.

42
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,397
He was supposed to fight to the end.
But that didn’t happen.

43
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,396
Some kids pulled him out of the ring.

44
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,485
Who?

45
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,432
They looked like Malays. Like you.

46
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,396
Pinoy wants him back.

47
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,510
Your other jobs? All done?

48
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,359
I don’t baby-sit. You know my style.

49
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,513
And we know Boss style.
There is no choice.

50
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,351
If the kid acts tough?

51
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,436
Do what you have to.

52
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,318
His manager didn’t show up today.

53
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,513
Maybe he planned it.
The Chinese Bird Guy.

54
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,313
I don’t baby-sit either.
If I were you, Id just finish off the kid.

55
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,514
So, what do you want?

56
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,475
Stop moving.

57
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,485
Where are you taking me?

58
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,433
To a safe place.
The Thais will be looking for us.

59
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,513
Tapa, turn left up ahead.
Then go straight.

60
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,277
None of the border checkpoints will be safe.

61
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,510
They will be all over the place by now.

62
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,431
The border? What are you talking about?

63
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,436
The safest place is back home.

64
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,273
I didn’t ask to be brought here.
I don’t have a choice now.

65
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,245
Why don’t you have a choice?

66
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,397
You can stay here and die.
Or you can go home.

67
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,396
Its up to you.

68
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,469
Lets go.

69
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,313
Good morning. Good morning.

70
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,271
Good morning.

71
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,429
My name is...

72
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,445
Say it. Oi!

73
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,280
Maybe the bird doesn’t speak English.

74
00:11:48,315 --> 00:11:52,273
What is... your name?

75
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,353
Bunga Lalang.

76
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,399
My name is... Bunga Lalang.

77
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,280
What do you want?

78
00:12:05,315 --> 00:12:06,395
Where is he?

79
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,273
He’s not here.

80
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,405
I don’t know. And I don’t want to know.

81
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,433
He went his own way.
He doesn’t listen to anyone.

82
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,473
You’re the one who’s not listening.
I asked, where is he?

83
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,317
I...

84
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,473
Tell me. Don’t make this
hard for yourself. Say it.

85
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,273
Bunohan.

86
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,472
Bunohan. Bunohan.

87
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,317
Bunohan

88
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,351
Whose kid are you?

89
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,396
Why are you playing here?

90
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,360
Where do you live?

91
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:46,475
Over there.

92
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,396
Father, you can move back
into the master bedroom.

93
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,392
I’m here now. Ill take care of the house.

94
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,359
I’m thinking of moving back here to teach.

95
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,311
I can take care of you.

96
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,432
What does your mother say about this?

97
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,312
This is her idea.

98
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,473
Once I get a job,
Anna and Farah will join me here.

99
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,393
Anna can work at the local bank.
I going to start a business.

100
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,398
Can you help me?

101
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,352
Find Adil.

102
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,272
I want to see him.

103
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,325
5 years is quite a while, Father.

104
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,316
If he cared, he would have come back...

105
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,352
Four years and ten months.

106
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,437
Please find him.

107
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,352
Its too late, Yeah

108
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,278
Adil

109
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,432
Adil

110
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,475
Adil

111
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,312
Adil

112
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,395
Adil!

113
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,280
Leh, Don’t mind if I help myself.

114
00:18:48,315 --> 00:18:50,396
Sure. Go ahead.

115
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,431
Patience.

116
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,472
I have to make my way in first.

117
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,510
These things take time.

118
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,392
We have to move fast.

119
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,319
Five years ago I didn’t have the cash.
But now, I do.

120
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,380
You have been in the city for too long.

121
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:16,365
You cant bring Kuala Lumpur back here.

122
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,393
You asked me to take care of it. So let me.

123
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,393
Its like this. Ill give you a way in.

124
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,311
These people owe money.

125
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,353
So you help them settle their debts,
Then they will be indebted.

126
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,433
Its like shares and the stock market,
Their gratitude is the commodity.

127
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,353
Once they owe us, we reap the dividends.

128
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,352
What’s with the kickboxing club?

129
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,353
That’s how we get in.
Awang Sonar owes me money.

130
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,433
Perfect. We can set up fights at his club.

131
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,353
But you’d want good fighters,
and they don’t come cheap.

132
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,312
Across the border,
they are tied to Thai gangs.

133
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,353
You don’t need to worry.
I’ve got some fighters in mind.

134
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,272
I saw Bunga Lalang.

135
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,405
New shoes, Jolok?

136
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,476
Yeah, check them out. Crocodile leather.

137
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,440
Must be the Golok River crocodile.

138
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:56,477
Watch it! They just might bite you.

139
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,271
I’m here.

140
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,430
Ill go look for Pok Wah.

141
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,360
You gave that to my son years ago.

142
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,395
I remember.

143
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,433
Was it the year of the rabbit?
Or the eagle?... Owl maybe?

144
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,520
Crocodile.
That’s how the women here still remember you.

145
00:22:43,555 --> 00:22:46,405
I’ve heard all kinds of stories about you.

146
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,399
Mahdi said he worked with you on a ship.
In Mesir, I think.

147
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,245
I bumped into him once.

148
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,273
Not in Mesir.
In Marseille. France.

149
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,245
You? And this boat?

150
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,273
People like you work on ships.
You get to see the world.

151
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,473
But in the end, even the world
gets washed up on the beach.

152
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,433
I’m a lost cause. My woman wont
let me fish at sea anymore.

153
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,473
I remember getting one of these.
But I cant remember where.

154
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,433
You didn’t come here just to
catch up with an old friend.

155
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,352
I’m looking for this kid.

156
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,405
Bunga Lalang.

157
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,399
That’s shouldn’t be difficult.
Try your fathers house.

158
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,433
There’s nothing in that house for me.
What are you talking about?

159
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,353
He was born around the time you left.

160
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,392
In the ring,
he is known as Bunga Lalang.

161
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,433
But his real name is Adil. Your brother.

162
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,353
Did his second wife have another kid,
or did the old pervert get another wife?

163
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,445
That’s why my mother divorced him.

164
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,459
Your dad was quite the crocodile.

165
00:24:15,494 --> 00:24:18,438
But he didn’t take a third wife.

166
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,285
That kid is his son.

167
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,313
So he’s my half brother. What do I care?

168
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,325
Ill get you a mattress.

169
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,916
Are you still doing your old job?

170
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:36,473
Don’t worry. You wont be involved.

171
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,516
Pok Wah.

172
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,356
Pok Wah.

173
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,313
Its hard to find peace in this world.

174
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,353
I run away from
the world and still they come.

175
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,318
Are you man or the devil himself?

176
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,840
Someone is not well.

177
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,635
Man is indeed sick.

178
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,395
What do I care?

179
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,351
I don’t do that kind of work anymore.

180
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,485
Please, Pok Wah.

181
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,485
You tell him that I cannot do anything.

182
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,440
Man has made a pact with
the devil to destroy this earth.

183
00:25:28,475 --> 00:25:32,433
I cannot help him.
He has to help himself.

184
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,285
Its Adil who is injured.

185
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,357
Why didn’t you say so earlier?
What’s wrong with you?

186
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,480
It was hard to get a word in
while you made your speech.

187
00:25:44,515 --> 00:25:48,393
What? You think Im a politician,
making speeches?

188
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,473
No sign of you for months, Suddenly,
you come to save me like some hero.

189
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,432
Be grateful.

190
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,460
Its a good thing I knew about the fight

191
00:26:55,495 --> 00:26:58,405
Or should I have left you to die there?

192
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,433
For years I worked my way up,
and made a name for myself over there.

193
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,399
Now you’ve brought me back to this dump.

194
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,433
Thanks a lot, Mr. Muski Abdul Rahman.

195
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,393
Even in the darkness, there will be light.

196
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,473
Leave the bad, and take the good.

197
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,273
Father, some people from
Kuala Lumpur are interested in our land.

198
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,477
It could be a good opportunity for us.

199
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,432
Adil doesn’t care about these things.

200
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,314
He doesn’t even care about our family.

201
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,353
You cant say such things.

202
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,473
You do not know him anymore.
You do not even know who I am.

203
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,353
We are just like the shadows on your screen.

204
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,360
What stories are you making up now, Bakar?

205
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:09,485
You are the storyteller.

206
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,513
All the villagers talk about your story.

207
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,360
People will say all kinds of things.

208
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:19,935
You were too young to remember.

209
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,476
You are too old to remember.

210
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,520
The villagers talk about you
and your ex-wife, Mek Yah.

211
00:28:26,555 --> 00:28:29,398
You forget.

212
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,433
The land I gave to you,
you sold. The money, gone.

213
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,473
Now you want the 30 acres.
I might as well give it to llham.

214
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,313
What did that animal ever do for you?

215
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,470
I know that you don’t care about him.

216
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,513
At least I have a plan to do
something with the land.

217
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,433
You know nothing about that land.
Just stay out of it.

218
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,353
If you sell that land,
what will become of our stories?

219
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,352
How will we live?

220
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,416
You should stick to teaching.

221
00:29:05,451 --> 00:29:08,432
We cannot live on stories alone.

222
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,473
If I develop that land,
Then people can see how it should be done.

223
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,313
You cannot pay people to learn, Bakar.

224
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,268
You’re stubborn, Yah.

225
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,393
Like I said, this is the work
of your half-brother, Bakar.

226
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,325
He’s been paying some guys
to move the old graves.

227
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,477
You’re wasting your time.
Your mothers grave is no longer there.

228
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,485
Why is he doing this?

229
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,360
He’s planning a project
on your fathers land.

230
00:30:49,395 --> 00:30:51,430
That’s what I heard.

231
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,473
These are the relocated graves,
originally from the cemetery on your beach.

232
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,393
Look at this. Male and female
tombstones on the same grave.

233
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,433
There, two headstones on one grave.

234
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,245
I’ve been meaning to see you
for some time now.

235
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,280
There’s something I want to discuss,
and ask for your permission.

236
00:32:17,315 --> 00:32:19,271
You have that land by the beach, don’t you?

237
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,392
The 30 acres,
next to Awang Sonars boxing club.

238
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,405
Yes. That one.

239
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,318
If you are interested,
some people are very keen to buy it.

240
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,440
They are willing to pay a deposit 30 percent.

241
00:32:30,475 --> 00:32:32,440
In cash. Immediately.

242
00:32:32,475 --> 00:32:33,429
Here you go.

243
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,440
A drink? You shouldn’t
have troubled yourself.

244
00:32:36,475 --> 00:32:37,405
Bakar.

245
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,398
Talib. But people call me Jolok.

246
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,393
So, if you agree, those Kuala Lumpur
people want to meet you...

247
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,280
And see the land. Better still,
if they can see the land title as well.

248
00:32:52,315 --> 00:32:56,273
Its obvious, he’s going to cheat.
Its always the same old story.

249
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,353
Its like this Jolok.
I cannot make the decision.

250
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,313
The owner of the land is not here.

251
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,396
But it is your land, isn’t it?

252
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,433
It is in my name.
But it is not mine.

253
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,393
What’s the story now?
Its not his land. So whose is it?

254
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,393
Its ok. Ill sort it out.

255
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,433
You said that you saw Adil. Where?

256
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,393
I was across the Thai border.
I had some bets on a kickboxing fight.

257
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,273
I lost everything. Some guys
pulled him out of the ring and ran.

258
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,245
Who is he, Bakar?

259
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,431
I hear that he helps a lot of people.

260
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,473
Father, its time for your medicines.

261
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,418
What’s he doing?
It was supposed to be an easy job.

262
00:34:44,453 --> 00:34:47,317
Looks like he’s planning
to kill the whole village.

263
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,432
Maybe he’s digging his own grave.

264
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,325
But, that’s a lot of graves.

265
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,432
Maybe he’s got a lot of dying to do.

266
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,314
You can go back. Ill handle this.

267
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,245
See, there’s nothing here.

268
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,273
Its my mothers grave. I cant just let it go.

269
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,397
Enough llham. This is pointless.

270
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,350
You’ve been gone for over 20 years.
Nobody even remembers anymore.

271
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,485
Only stories are left.

272
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,398
Some folks say that
she turned into a creature.

273
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,325
Stories like that are a waste of time.

274
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,352
If you want the truth,
you have to find it yourself.

275
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,416
Awang, I have settled your debt with Bakar.

276
00:36:25,451 --> 00:36:29,313
Now you just need to settle it with me.

277
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,496
Bakars helped you villagers a lot.

278
00:36:33,531 --> 00:36:37,473
Now, you should try to help him.

279
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,433
But Bakar didn’t tell me
anything about this.

280
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,477
Bakars too shy to say anything.

281
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,308
He’s not the type to
ask for his money back.

282
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,405
Then let me settle with him.

283
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,320
There’s no need to trouble
yourself like that.

284
00:36:56,355 --> 00:37:00,313
Like this, lets fix up your club.

285
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,475
Then we organize a fight.

286
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,470
We make money out of that.

287
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,480
After the fight,
your debt will be cleared.

288
00:37:07,515 --> 00:37:10,440
Ill need to speak to Pok Wah about this.

289
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:12,396
We started this club together.

290
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,433
Its best that he knows as well.

291
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,245
Listen carefully, Jolok.

292
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,273
He works hard and Im good
to hardworking people.

293
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,476
He farms fish, doesn’t he?

294
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,520
Life is unpredictable.

295
00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:41,994
Crops can fail.

296
00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:45,433
And so can fish.

297
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,433
Ketot, this is the last batch, right?

298
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,433
Hurry up, Ketot.
This place gives me the creeps.

299
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,273
You’re fine digging up graves.
But here you’re scared?

300
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,430
That place was different.

301
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,473
Gasi, what’s going on over there?

302
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,393
He’s healed so fast.
What kind of medicine did you give him?

303
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,356
Its not easy to
find these things anymore.

304
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:18,313
Because mankind is
bent on destroying nature.

305
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,393
But if we do right,
the earth will give to us.

306
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,396
Where did you learn this stuff?

307
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,433
Adils mother.

308
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,476
Mek Ani?

309
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,405
Everyone has a mother.

310
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,319
Its even better if
she has a touch of magic.

311
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,353
If you can have both,
you will want for nothing.

312
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,433
I’m also going to need
a touch of magic soon.

313
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,433
I have a fight coming up.

314
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,285
You have a fight?

315
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,313
Yeah, Awang Sonar arranged it.

316
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,353
Its time I started helping my mother.

317
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,436
So I hear you are having a fight.

318
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,314
Joloks setting it up.

319
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,353
We can fix up the club,
and make a bit of money.

320
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,353
If something isn’t broken,
why do we need to fix it?

321
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,359
There’s no harm fixing up the place a bit.

322
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,272
Are you in debt?

323
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,470
Well, kind of.

324
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,358
Just spit it out.

325
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,273
I took a loan from Bakar,
to start my fish farms.

326
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,900
Then Jolok bought over the debt.

327
00:44:41,935 --> 00:44:45,644
Now I have to pay him instead.

328
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:49,353
This morning, all my fish died.

329
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,433
This is not about our club.
Its the land they are after.

330
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,445
How could you be so stupid?

331
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,391
I asked you to take care of this club.

332
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,360
Not give it away to other people.

333
00:45:06,395 --> 00:45:08,416
I haven’t given it away.

334
00:45:08,451 --> 00:45:10,438
Do you trust that Jolok?

335
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,500
Do you know who he is?

336
00:45:12,535 --> 00:45:14,485
Its not like you think.

337
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:18,354
We could make a bit of money.

338
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,393
One fight will not make any money.

339
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,393
Were putting four fighters in,
including Adil.

340
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,313
You might as well throw me in.
Then they can really have the land.

341
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,393
You’ve been poisoned
more than your fish.

342
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,353
Father, here’s
a new medicine. Try some.

343
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,473
It wont help.
I feel so strangely tired today.

344
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:22,513
Father, here are some
documents relating to the land.

345
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,436
Please have a look.

346
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,365
Have you found Adil yet?

347
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,400
I have friends tracking him
down in Thailand.

348
00:46:33,435 --> 00:46:37,393
I need to discuss some things with you.

349
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,513
Those people, they have come up
with quite a good plan.

350
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:50,353
I’m sure they have.
Ill take a look at it later.

351
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,473
Were going ahead. Don’t worry. Be patient.

352
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,392
Ill give you a bonus as well.

353
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,365
No, don’t come here.

354
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,470
Ill go over to your place.

355
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,313
Stubborn people like you
always look for trouble.

356
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,392
They are the ones looking for trouble.

357
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,393
Even being stubborn
has its time and place.

358
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,365
This is not a normal fight.

359
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,393
The puppet master
is none other than Bakar.

360
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,473
I’ve already told Awang. I’m fighting.

361
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,476
Its thanks to him that were in this mess.

362
00:47:51,511 --> 00:47:55,473
Whatever it is, we still have to fight.

363
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,313
You are the one who taught me to be brave.

364
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,480
I also taught you to find other ways.

365
00:48:08,515 --> 00:48:09,485
What other way is there?

366
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,513
Tell that to my father, or my brother.

367
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,517
There’s no point talking to the deaf.

368
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,273
Adik, why are you playing in here? Get out.
Get out, I said.

369
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,393
Bakar didn’t tell me that you were back.

370
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,393
I need to talk to you.

371
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,445
I’ve given Bakar his share.

372
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,473
Its time I gave you
the 30 acres by the beach.

373
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,353
That’s ok. I don’t want anything from you.

374
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,325
It is your land.

375
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:53,353
Id like to talk to you
about other things too.

376
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,397
23 years have passed.

377
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,436
And now you want to talk?

378
00:52:03,471 --> 00:52:06,433
This is all the time I have.

379
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,485
I know all about time.

380
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,513
Whether I live or die
is decided in 3 minutes.

381
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,393
Maybe you can give me 3 minutes.

382
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,473
Nobody can force
23 years into 3 minutes.

383
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,433
What have you been
doing all these years?

384
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,440
Mek Ani and Bakar
treated me like a bastard.

385
00:52:39,475 --> 00:52:41,351
You never stopped them.

386
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,480
Back then, I didn’t know.

387
00:52:44,515 --> 00:52:46,445
You didn’t know?

388
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,473
You didn’t know that Mek Ani
wouldn’t let me call her Mother?

389
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,353
Let me honor a promise I once made.
Please take that land.

390
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,352
Your three minutes are up.

391
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,476
What are you doing here?

392
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,317
Nothing.

393
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,360
There is nothing here for you.

394
00:53:22,395 --> 00:53:26,353
Why are you here?

395
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,433
I came back to take care of Father.

396
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,433
Our land. Some people want to buy it.

397
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,513
If we sell now, it would help the family.

398
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,392
What damned family?

399
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,445
It could help you too.

400
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,480
Better than breaking
your bones across the border.

401
00:54:01,515 --> 00:54:04,438
Broken bones can mend.

402
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,473
The problem is you.
You break peoples spirit.

403
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,473
If you really want to help,
just write off Awang Sonars debt.

404
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,353
You have to speak to Jolok about that.

405
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,397
I managed to talk him
into coming back to see you.

406
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,325
Its his land.

407
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,280
We cant for him any longer.

408
00:54:42,315 --> 00:54:44,271
Its too late, Bakar.

409
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,390
I have to make a decision now.

410
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,433
This is all that’s left for me to do.

411
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,351
I have no strength left.

412
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,320
Since I was young, i've hated sleeping.

413
00:54:58,355 --> 00:55:00,356
And I hate people who sleep a lot.

414
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,285
Its a waste of time.

415
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,390
Well, it looks like you’re
still not sleeping.

416
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,433
When I first started doing this,
it wasn’t easy.

417
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,513
He begged me for a couple more days,
to see his mother.

418
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,433
After that, it was easy.
Like lighting a cigarette. That’s the truth.

419
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,520
What? Sleeping?

420
00:55:23,555 --> 00:55:26,512
Killing.

421
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:49,353
Our very own champion,
Adil Bunga Lalang from Bunohan.

422
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:38,375
What kind of a fight was that?

423
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:41,431
Were you fighting or running amok?

424
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,445
Who taught you to fight like that?

425
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,520
Stubborn people like you
will never get anywhere.

426
00:57:47,555 --> 00:57:50,318
What are you talking about?

427
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,325
Its your land that’s at stake here.

428
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,396
Maybe you should go
meditate under that tree.

429
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,918
What a fight!

430
00:57:57,953 --> 00:58:00,396
Nice! Nice.

431
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,512
This is Jolok.

432
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,316
I could punch that jerk.

433
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,440
Take it easy, its his money
that’s helping the club.

434
00:58:24,475 --> 00:58:28,433
Helping? To destroy it?

435
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,390
What did she become?

436
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,280
You said she turned into a creature.

437
01:00:12,315 --> 01:00:12,445
What kind of thing?

438
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,392
When did you get cut like that?

439
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,280
How much longer is he staying?

440
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:20,430
Not much longer.

441
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,920
Keep an eye on him.
I need to get some bandages.

442
01:00:23,955 --> 01:00:27,360
Why are you always
messing around on that boat?

443
01:00:27,395 --> 01:00:31,353
Don’t be so nosy, woman.

444
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,520
Jolok, did you hear about
the two bodies found in the river?

445
01:00:52,555 --> 01:00:54,517
People say it looked
like crocodiles got them.

446
01:00:54,552 --> 01:00:56,480
Leh, there are only
two crocodiles around here.

447
01:00:56,515 --> 01:00:58,311
Me. And the one I wear on my feet.

448
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:01,432
If you say so.

449
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,440
Brother, we made history in Bunohan.

450
01:01:07,475 --> 01:01:10,477
We won big.

451
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:17,353
After deducting my investment,
you get 7 percent of the profits.

452
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,433
That’s a lot. Normally,
you would only get about 3 or 4 percent.

453
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,473
But, what about my boys?

454
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,320
Yes, your fighters certainly won.

455
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,440
Instead, he beat the
other kid so bad, he’s in hospital.

456
01:01:41,475 --> 01:01:45,433
I’m paying for that too.

457
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,392
But you promised.

458
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:55,513
We organize a fight,
then my debt is settled.

459
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,898
Awang, we live in
the 21st century now.

460
01:01:58,933 --> 01:02:01,356
This is what saddens me
about our people.

461
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,313
They don’t think long term.
But its ok Awang.

462
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,900
Like this. We do another fight.

463
01:02:07,935 --> 01:02:10,405
This time, only two fighters.

464
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,433
A smaller investment,
with higher returns. Sounds good, no?

465
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,472
Awang!

466
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:26,432
Forget it.

467
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,393
Awang.

468
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:00,433
The 21st century sure has its challenges.

469
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,473
Here, let me give it a shot.

470
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,285
Its not that complicated.

471
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,440
Hey, Bakar, can this thing find people?

472
01:03:11,475 --> 01:03:14,280
That dickbrain Gasi disappeared.

473
01:03:14,315 --> 01:03:16,271
Must be shagging in Golok.

474
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,469
Give it back.

475
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,273
Once we control it,
we control the whole area.

476
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,245
Bakar, what’s the story with
the kickboxing clubs land.

477
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,396
If we don’t have that,
we don’t have access to your land, right?

478
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,445
Were just waiting
to sign the papers, sir.

479
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,473
If its not sorted in a couple of days,
were pulling out. Understand?

480
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:49,477
Jolok.

481
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,485
Were running out of time.

482
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:56,513
Tomorrow, I want you to
put up a fence and a signboard.

483
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,876
And clear a road to this place. Got it?

484
01:04:02,911 --> 01:04:06,433
Your dad? What’s the deal?
Should we pray?

485
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:11,473
Yeah, you pray. I will answer.

486
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,433
That’s weird. Gasi and Ketot
moved all the graves the other day.

487
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:23,353
Well, maybe you need to pray some more.

488
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,273
Call a shaman.
Get him to cleanse the land.

489
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,433
You are doing a shadow
play in the daytime?

490
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,312
No, it isn’t the right time for it.

491
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:53,353
But in Java, they do it in the daytime
to chase away the evil spirits.

492
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:02,313
But how will we see anything?
There are no shadows.

493
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:06,353
What a clever boy you are.

494
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:11,353
We don’t do that over here.
That’s why there is so much evil everywhere.

495
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:18,513
Don’t worry, ill help you to fight.
I have some puppets.

496
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,325
Where did you get those?

497
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:30,353
I found them in the other room.
Whose are they?

498
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:34,473
I made them back
when I was teaching my sons.

499
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,400
Why didn’t you color them in?

500
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:43,393
I never finished.

501
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,245
This is my mothers land.

502
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:10,273
She moved here after
Mek Ani married your father.

503
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:14,353
Look at all this.
Your brother Bakars handiwork.

504
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,473
Your mother would be
so pleased if she knew.

505
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:24,273
I don’t have anything
to do with them anymore.

506
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,513
I got out of here as soon
as I could. Just like you.

507
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,269
I kill people.

508
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:36,313
So i’ve heard.

509
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:45,353
Your own brothers life,
what’s it worth?

510
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:53,353
Everything.

511
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:00,433
You destroyed everything.
You chased my mother out.

512
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,320
She shouldn’t have had to live like this.

513
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:09,313
All alone. Dead without a trace.

514
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,433
I shouldn’t have...

515
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:23,353
Do your dirty work somewhere else.

516
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,433
He claims this is his mothers land.

517
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,272
Father!

518
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,311
Is Father in?

519
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,405
What do you want?

520
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:03,325
Why does he want to give me that land?

521
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:07,353
Ilham says it is his mothers,
that it belongs to her.

522
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,397
I want to speak to Father.

523
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,419
He doesn’t need to speak to you.

524
01:08:13,454 --> 01:08:16,399
I want to know whose son I am.

525
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:22,353
Father! I have a right to know.

526
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:26,393
Who am I? Father! Answer me!

527
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:31,445
Father!

528
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:35,473
I have a right to know.

529
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:40,433
Who am I? Father! Answer me!

530
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:52,513
Adil is not my real brother.
Whose son is he?

531
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:57,399
Who is Adil?

532
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:13,360
It looks like I have to baby-sit now.

533
01:09:13,395 --> 01:09:16,285
Why didn’t you just do your job?

534
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:20,313
It could have been so simple.
Come here, take him out, leave.

535
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,430
What’s that?

536
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,365
Herbs.

537
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,415
This guy is injured, and
you’re giving him stuff that goats eat?

538
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:34,431
If you crush them and apply to
his wound, hell heal really fast.

539
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,405
Where did you learn this stuff?

540
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:39,433
His mother taught me.
She was the best traditional healer.

541
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:49,405
Here, go buy some real medicine.

542
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,325
I need to find Bunga Lalang after this.

543
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,396
Before my boss sends
someone else down here.

544
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:57,353
You’re looking for him as well?
What do you want with him?

545
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:01,313
Don’t worry. You wont be involved.

546
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:05,353
You guys are all the same.

547
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,319
How did llham end up like that?

548
01:10:14,354 --> 01:10:16,318
Who knows when it comes to lllham.

549
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:20,353
Just take care of him well.

550
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,429
I want to see llham.

551
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:27,405
Now, what do you want?

552
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,433
Pok Wah, is there anything
you want to tell me?

553
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,513
You father should be
the one to tell you.

554
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:42,473
When Mek Yah gave birth to you,
Pok Eng asked my mother to help.

555
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,316
We are Chinese.
We can keep your secrets.

556
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:47,405
Jing...

557
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:51,433
If we wait for you,
when will it ever come out?

558
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,245
You were born out of wedlock.

559
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:05,273
Mek Yah is your real mother.
You were born after they divorced.

560
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,520
Wah, my mother promised Mek Yah..
if Adil ever asked...

561
01:11:16,555 --> 01:11:19,398
I know.

562
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:23,433
I guess this is the time.

563
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:30,273
If you care about that kid, make sure
I never see him across the border.

564
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:28,285
Your friend Kruba just called me.

565
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,436
He might be coming down
in the next couple of days.

566
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:34,320
He needs to settle
some unfinished business.

567
01:12:34,355 --> 01:12:38,313
That would be my work.

568
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:42,353
I hear you have some jobs to do.

569
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:47,280
Must be tough, bearing
the burden of two jobs at once.

570
01:12:47,315 --> 01:12:50,317
What if I help carry Miss Bunga?

571
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:53,405
He has unfinished business with me.

572
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:57,433
That should help lighten your burden.
How about it?

573
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:02,273
Its ok. He’s a friend.

574
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:09,320
I can take care of my own problems.

575
01:13:09,355 --> 01:13:13,245
Were practically brothers.

576
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:17,273
We speak the same language.
Only our dialect is slightly different.

577
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,285
Today, you are here on
this side of the border.

578
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:23,313
Tomorrow, my people will
be over there, on your side.

579
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:27,353
Friend, we have always helped each other.

580
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:33,433
You just take care of llham.

581
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,278
For the coffee.

582
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,325
Jolok, if you were in politics, you’d win.

583
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,353
That would be you.
I cant. I’m much too honest.

584
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:56,353
Here’s the fruit you asked about.
Its not easy to find.

585
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,311
What do you want with it?
Its poisonous, you know.

586
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:02,353
I’m using it as medicine.
Here’s the money.

587
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,245
Enough?

588
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:06,475
Yes, thank you.

589
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,318
I would prefer to have
the Main Puteri ritual.

590
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:27,320
But I I can tell you,
you will need many shamans.

591
01:14:27,355 --> 01:14:31,313
More than the usual.

592
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:33,432
You promised a bonus.

593
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,445
You finish the job first.

594
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:38,440
Muski, your brothers
haven’t brought the goats back.

595
01:15:38,475 --> 01:15:41,280
Its getting dark. Can you go find them?

596
01:15:41,315 --> 01:15:43,350
Alright.

597
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:47,433
You have to help me.
I need the money. My mothers ill.

598
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:55,473
Do this job well, and I will
give you more than a bonus.

599
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:00,313
I have a new project coming up and
ill need help. People like you.

600
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:05,353
But first you have to
prove your loyalty. How about it?

601
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:52,405
Did you know my mother very well?

602
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:56,433
I’ve heard people say
all kinds of things about her.

603
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:00,439
Don’t listen to them.

604
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,473
Your mother was not like other people.
She had her own way.

605
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,398
But she wasn’t a bad person.

606
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:11,285
That’s the problem with our people.

607
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,285
They fear things
they don’t even understand.

608
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:18,313
How fear turns into hate,
I have yet to find the source.

609
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,285
Do you have any idea
who Im fighting against?

610
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:28,313
I’m troubled that they
haven’t made a decision yet.

611
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:34,433
I’m not that worried.
All I ask for is a clean fight.

612
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,325
That I cannot promise.

613
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:46,353
Have faith. You have to fight well.

614
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:52,433
After this fight, I want
to go back and see Father.

615
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:02,473
Come, its deep enough now.
Let me drive.

616
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:22,360
If you didn’t do this,
what would you be doing?

617
01:18:22,395 --> 01:18:26,353
Id have gone to see the world.

618
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:31,416
I should have come back more often.

619
01:18:31,451 --> 01:18:35,353
But its ok, shell be back soon.

620
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,358
Mines bigger.

621
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:53,279
Mines sharper.

622
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,476
Father.

623
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,431
Father.

624
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,431
Father!

625
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:23,319
Its getting dark. You’d better go home.

626
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,405
I want to watch.

627
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,433
You want to see, come back tomorrow.
Go now, its getting dark.

628
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:22,353
You haven’t paid anyone to
pull you off the ring this time?

629
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:27,513
Come place your bets.
Come on, come on.

630
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,320
Gentlemen, tonight were
expecting a spectacular fight.

631
01:20:38,355 --> 01:20:40,405
In the red corner...

632
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:44,433
Muski the Black Stallion!

633
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:14,480
And in the blue corner,
its none other than...

634
01:21:14,515 --> 01:21:18,473
Bunga Lalang!

635
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,316
That’s the end of the second round.

636
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:05,393
Don’t be the frog under the coconut shell.

637
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:09,433
If you want to go, you should.
There’s an endless ocean out there.

638
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:15,513
Its not my calling yet, I guess.
Its fate that Im here with you.

639
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:20,433
I should be in Paris now, sipping wine by -
What’s that river called?

640
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,440
I don’t know how to say it either.

641
01:23:24,475 --> 01:23:28,433
Yeah, yeah, in your dreams.

642
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:41,473
Round three!

643
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:18,473
Perhaps you were fated to be here,
or is it my fate that brought you here?

644
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:24,393
This is the way we are. Our lives caught
in the web of other peoples stories.

645
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:30,313
But my story ends here.

646
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:35,393
Your brother?

647
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:40,513
Leave him. Let him go.

648
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:08,273
What's happened to Adil?

649
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:27,440
What’s wrong Pok Wah?

650
01:26:27,475 --> 01:26:30,398
Poison? Poison!

651
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:34,433
Carry him!

652
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:55,393
When you married the other woman,
I knew all would be shattered.

653
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:02,273
Come. Go with me.

654
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:03,405
Its too late Yah.

655
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:06,398
Its late, but its not over yet.

656
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:10,433
Healing needs time.
And time needs healing.

657
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,271
Look at me.

658
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:18,313
I am ravaged, torn and ripped apart.
But still, I am here.

659
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:24,313
There are no more like me.
I am the last of my kind.

660
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:29,399
You are stubborn, Yah. Hard as a rock.

661
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:33,365
For people like me,
this is the only way to live.

662
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,898
Otherwise, I would have
ended up just like the others.

663
01:28:36,933 --> 01:28:40,397
Throwing away the land,
throwing away our stories.

664
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:44,399
I have always loved you.

665
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:47,245
I was never ashamed of our love.

666
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:51,273
Even if I had to become a creature
that crawled the earth.

667
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:55,313
You forgot how we spoke,

668
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:59,433
Loved and sang to
the spirits of the earth.

669
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:05,405
Speak to me. Sing to me.

670
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:09,360
I must release the spirits
trapped inside you,

671
01:29:09,395 --> 01:29:12,352
And return them to the land.

672
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:15,420
I have no strength left.

673
01:29:15,455 --> 01:29:18,405
I will give you strength.

674
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:22,433
Till we speak again with meaning,

675
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:28,280
Our words will mark like
footprints on the earth.

676
01:29:28,315 --> 01:29:31,431
Our breath will stir the leaves,

677
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:35,440
move the waters, and hold up
the birds in their flight.

678
01:29:35,475 --> 01:29:39,433
Our love will set the world ablaze.

679
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:44,392
Father.

680
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:48,433
Why are you disturbing me
out here, Bakar? I’m working.

681
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:54,439
Father, I want that land. I don’t care.

682
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:58,473
You’re so crude. Is the land
all you can think of?

683
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:08,477
How did it end like this?

684
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,520
I heard the voices of the shadow
puppets coming from his body.

685
01:31:14,555 --> 01:31:18,320
The voices of the different characters.

686
01:31:18,355 --> 01:31:20,356
Now I cant really hear them.

687
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,311
I’m not as strong as I used to be.

688
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:23,405
Then we have to help.

689
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:26,320
If we don’t, all will be lost.
We have to perform the healing ritual.

690
01:31:26,355 --> 01:31:29,357
How are we going to do that?
Mek Yahs not here. No one's left.

691
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:32,360
Well just have to find away to do it.

692
01:31:32,395 --> 01:31:36,353
Its time. Lets go now.

693
01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:05,354
"Proposed Development for Marina and Resort
