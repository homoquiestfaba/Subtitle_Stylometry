it cannot be absolutely what you had me

49

bring the naturalist follow the Beagle

50
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,990
fellow she says we are well behaved Apes

51
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,050
it was you who believed this and now you

52
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,410
say the opposite not the opposite merely

53
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,120
to point out the limits of it just as

54
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,300
we'd more than bananas in other ways

55
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:32,509
clearly we are not X and in this

56
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:33,709
this distribution of desire British

57
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:41,230
otherwise italian british as much as you

58
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,860
we are british because of how we are yes

59
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,650
when I think of the fools who believe in

60
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,610
such things there it is mr. Bartel

61
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,840
notice a photograph you may believe what

62
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,700
you see with your own eyes may you not I

63
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,170
believe what I see in you miss Douglas

64
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:03,370
dear your sweet beauty and noble

65
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,469
simplicity I should have told you I mean

66
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:07,669
often

67
00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:14,950
first my siblings they wasted away

68
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,780
finally your mother is to be sentient

69
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,080
simply to watch never to prevent only to

70
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,529
wait for something horrible to happened

71
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,530
to your child

72
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:37,779
one after another they melted away from

73
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:38,979
her

74
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:49,139
and she too was taken and fatherless

75
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:57,960
they slept too deeply all of them these

76
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:01,790
are your enemies these are the beasts

77
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:09,789
that still lives

78
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:10,989
these stole them all I expect so

79
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:19,550
however a doctor's expected to catch

80
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,940
such tiny little sissies they cannot be

81
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,389
caught one can only deny them the

82
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:30,590
conditions that favor their growth might

83
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,559
you discover an end to all sickness we

84
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,180
might we very well my dear

85
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:46,380
I don't know what we do but we all live

86
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:58,019

87
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:05,110

88
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,310
as protector will you

89
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,779
well you showed me your place of work

90
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:27,979
the laboratory is no place for a woman

91
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,789

92
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:38,290

294
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:38,518
for instance man and woman both we were

295
00:49:38,718 --> 00:49:44,979

night's rest by Mamie and we were on the

376
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:33,169
correct path or it may mean nothing at

377
00:58:33,369 --> 00:58:34,369
all

378
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:43,409
you do have a responsibility to your

379
00:58:43,609 --> 00:58:47,220
husband but it is not too bad child

381
00:58:50,629 --> 00:58:54,239
his every hourly whim not some poor

382
00:58:54,439 --> 00:58:57,210
slave girl in the sheiks harem husbands

383
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:58,859

00:58:59,059 --> 00:59:03,780
their surroundings with their bottomless

385
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:06,660
thirsts we mean from him to unleash with

386
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:08,400
least and as much modesty and shame as

387
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,579
they can possibly muster those

388
00:59:11,779 --> 00:59:13,028
incarnations a few times the

389
00:59:13,228 --> 00:59:16,748
multiplication of our race

390
00:59:16,948 --> 00:59:19,719

never tell lies child quite so quite so

396
00:59:44,069 --> 00:59:48,009
but then again you must never fear

397
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:51,039
telling the truth now let us discuss

398
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:53,438

399
00:59:53,638 --> 00:59:55,809

410
01:01:40,518 --> 01:01:46,618
have you ever wondered why it is that

411
01:01:46,818 --> 01:01:48,180
women should appear to be lied it's

412
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:51,949
quite simple really

413
01:01:52,149 --> 01:01:56,009
you see if we glide then we have no legs

414
01:01:56,209 --> 01:01:59,150
and if we have no legs then men need not

415
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:04,619
be tormented by the thought of our lives

416
01:02:04,819 --> 01:02:08,489
by here amongst ourselves anywhere

417
01:02:08,689 --> 01:02:16,689
really that women live free of men they

418
01:02:29,719 --> 01:02:31,528
live with legs me ladies are you I

419
01:02:31,728 --> 01:02:35,179

Masters port wine to go with the cheese

421
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:47,080

423
01:02:57,619 --> 01:02:59,598
tomorrow you tense if the night should

424
01:02:59,798 --> 01:03:05,159
pass without incident and is that not

425
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,880
proved his role perhaps not certainly

426
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,818
that there is not your husband in body

427
01:03:12,018 --> 01:03:16,849
you see him evil and may be projected

428
01:03:17,049 --> 01:03:18,049
without will even without money

429
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:28,068

433
01:03:51,739 --> 01:03:56,119
be assured

434
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:15,550
you have allowed this crisis to fester

435
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:19,199
beyond all bounds now you talk of

436
01:06:19,399 --> 01:06:20,570
shattered nerves we you're a senior and

437
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:24,719
hallucination

438
01:06:24,919 --> 01:06:27,420
truth be told none of this is terribly

439
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:32,099
uncommon button in women of your wife's

440
01:06:32,299 --> 01:06:35,369
class now in your sorry case your wife

441
01:06:35,569 --> 01:06:37,829
is determined to let herself go

442
01:06:38,029 --> 01:06:40,469
it appears and with that surrender of

443
01:06:40,669 --> 01:06:44,239
character she has exposed to you your

444
01:06:44,439 --> 01:06:48,569
home and your child to a grave infection

445
01:06:48,769 --> 01:06:51,439
and I fear we have passed the point of

446
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,440
easy treatment

447
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:03,880

531
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:49,369
excuse yourself for acquiring arrest I

532
01:18:49,569 --> 01:18:54,680
know very well our women toil on our

533
01:18:54,880 --> 01:19:00,380
path under emotional burdens that are

534
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:04,219
quite unknown to us a time away to

535
01:19:04,419 --> 01:19:07,449
refresh one spirits could be arranged in

536
01:19:07,649 --> 01:19:09,448

537
01:19:16,019 --> 01:19:17,488
