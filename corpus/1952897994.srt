are finding this situation amusing.

745
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,720
But it's not a big leap

746
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,722
for a psychopath to go
from serial beatings

747
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,223
to serial murders.

748
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,058
The DPD has asked for your help

749
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,060
in finding The Crimson Bolt.

750
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,438
He's described as a muscular Caucasian,

751
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,107
about 6'5" with dark eyes.

752
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,067
Anyone with information please call...

753
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,736
Fuck.

754
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,988
Must be some sort of sex thing
with this motherfucker, huh?

755
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:40,989
What?

756
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,824
No.
[Scoffs]

757
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,827
I mean, I don't know.

758
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:46,995
Doesn't even interest me.

759
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:47,996
First I've heard of it.

760
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:48,997
What?

761
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,498
Yeah, news to me.
Huh...

762
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,833
How could you not hear it, Frank?

763
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,084
That's all
they been talking about.

764
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,669
This crazy motherfucker
dressed like Superman

765
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:55,837
is whacking people
with a pipe wrench

766
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:56,838
all over the city.

767
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,007
Just boom!
You're down.

768
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,176
Maybe they deserve to get whacked.

769
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,469
Deserve it?

770
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,638
Yeah, I heard that the people he's hitting,

771
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,933
they're the real criminals.

772
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,768
You just said
you never heard of him, Frank.

773
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:13,605
I didn't.
I haven't.

774
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,606
He just said it.

775
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,732
No, he didn't.

776
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,735
I just watched the whole thing with you.

777
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:19,861
He...

778
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,029
I thought
I heard him say that.

779
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,030
You're like a monkey.

780
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,740
[Laughs]

781
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,033
I'm not like a monkey.

782
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,868
Hey, me and Tish
going to the movies tomorrow.

783
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:27,869
You wanna meet us there?

784
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,371
No, I got stuff to do.

785
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,872
What, Frank?
What?

786
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,707
What do you gotta do?

787
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,875
Nothing.

788
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,211
Good, then you can get there early,

789
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,046
hold a place for us in line, okay?

790
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,547
[Sighs]

791
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,384
Come on. Come on.

792
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,551
Okay.

793
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,095
I'll take you to the movies,
all right?

794
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,429
My treat.
Shake it off, all right?

795
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,430
Got to get out more, baby.

796
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,266
Always kissing me.

797
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,433
Weird.

798
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,851
Order up.

799
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,979
Three, please.

800
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,457
I beg...
If I could just...

801
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,459
Oh, come on!
- Hey...

802
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,128
Oh, no, he didn't.

803
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,630
Why do people have to do that?

804
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,632
We've been waiting here forever.

805
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,926
[Women murmuring angrily]

806
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,761
I mean, it's important
that you realize that

807
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,763
there's, like,
a sailor's hat involved.

808
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:29,931
Hey!
- Like an actual-

809
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,141
Sailor's hat?

810
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,311
Hey, excuse me.

811
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,437
Hey.

812
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,772
Hey!
No butts.

813
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,274
What difference does it make to you?

814
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,275
Yeah, man.

815
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,776
No butting in line.

816
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,945
Go to the back of the line now.

817
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,280
Yeah.

818
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,116
Go fuck yourself.

819
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,117
Fuck yourself.

820
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,452
[Woman giggles]

821
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,578
Yeah.

822
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,455
Like, you know,
this big handsome guy back here,

823
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,789
he looks like fucking shit.

824
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,458
Literally, what's wrong
with his face?

825
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,502
I don't know
if it's flat or wide or-

826
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,629
Anyway...

827
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,886
Mommy.

828
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,263
Annie, come on.

829
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,850
Hey!

830
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,143
Don't butt!

831
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,478
Who do you think you're fooling?

832
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,479
I just saw you...

833
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,480
crunch!

834
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,981
Oh, my God!
- Oh, God!

835
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,149
Oh, no!
- Wait...

836
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,484
[grunts]

837
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,485
Oh, God!
Get off him!

838
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,819
What the hell
are you doing, you...

839
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,821
You butted too!

840
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:30,617
Oh, oh!
Oh, God!

841
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,163
Oh, God, Stop him!
Someone stop him!

842
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,456
Oh!

843
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,796
Hey.
Have you seen this?

844
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:43,880
It's weird.

845
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,382
What?

846
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,175
It's just what we talked about last week.

847
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,886
I mean, you have to admit,
remember?

848
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:50,887
No.

849
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,848
A guy who...
can I just...

850
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,558
Can I come back there?

851
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:56,726
What?

852
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,228
Can I just come back there with you?

853
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,396
We're friends, so...

854
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,563
No.

855
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,357
I'll wear those plastic gloves.

856
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,484
Kitchen door's right there,
sweetheart.

857
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,197
Maybe she's fixing
to ask you to prom, Frank.

858
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,199
I don't know her.

859
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,617
I mean, come on.
Remember?

860
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,369
No.

861
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,037
His name is The Crimson Bolt.

862
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,205
And he just...

863
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,874
like, he just uses a wrench
as a weapon.

864
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,209
I mean, somebody did it.

865
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,919
Somebody became a real one.

866
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:27,715
That sounds like a crazy man.

867
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,384
I'm Libby, by the way.

868
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,010
Hello.

869
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,638
Don't go making some joke
about "Libby's on your label,"

870
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:37,142
'cause it just...
it pisses me off.

871
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,351
What's your name?

872
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,561
Frank.

874
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:41,771
Oh, man.

875
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,107
I hope you'll be frank with me.

876
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,775
I hope you'll continue to be frank

877
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,110
in all of our future discussions.

878
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,403
Wait.

879
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,155
You just asked me
to not make fun of your name,

880
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,656
and then you just
made fun of my name.

881
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:52,991
I got something for you.

882
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,159
What is it?

883
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,827
You should come.

884
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:56,995
It's gonna be rad.

885
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,081
Lots of really awesome people.

Are you him?

887
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:07,839
What?

888
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,674
Are you the guy?

889
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,342
Are you this guy?

890
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,303
No.

891
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,764
It's okay if you are.

892
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:17,932
No, I'm not him.

893
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:21,936
No.

894
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,605
It's cool.

895
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,774
I hate when people butt.

896
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,527
I got a lot of work to do.

897
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,654

Detective John Felkner.

906
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,833
Hello.

907
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,337
You filed a report with me a couple weeks ago.

908
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,506
You mind if I come inside for a sec?

909
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,840
Inside the house?

910
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:37,637
Uh, it's just a bit chilly.
Yeah.

911
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,271
Thanks.

912
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,107
Oh, thanks.

913
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:53,778
So you filed that report.

914
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,781
Now, you and I came together
to the conclusion

915
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:02,453
that your wife wasn't kidnapped,
and she left you.

916
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,788
Uh...

917
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:07,417
Is there something in there?

918
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,418
What?

919
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,712
Is that a basement?

920
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,547
That's a closet.

921
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,049
You just keep looking over there.

922
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,634
No, I...
No, I don't.

923
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,969
Yeah, you do.

924
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,388
No.
There's nothing in there.

925
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,724
All right.

926
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,727
There's a dog in there.

927
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,061
A dog?

928
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,439
Yeah.

929

1112
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,609
Hello.
- Brian and Steve.

1113
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:36,944
Hey.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

1114
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:37,987
Hi.

1115
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,822
That is Mr. Jake hiding over there.

1116
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,115
Okay, okay.
Listen.

1117
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,199
I need to talk to you.

1118
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:45,536
It's important.
Please.

1119
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,538
Okay.

1120
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,457
Well, let's go back
to my bedroom.

1121
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,923
No, Christian.

1122
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,635
What?

1123
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:02,636
They're after me.

1124
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:05,723
And I was shot.

1125
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,683
[Screams]
Oh, my God.

1126
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,101
[Banging at door]

1127
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,269
Hey, Lib, babe,
you okay?

1128
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,353
Yeah.

1129
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:12,354
Oh, my God.
You're him.

1130
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,355
I knew it.

1131
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:14,690
This is so cool.

1132
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:17,318
This is so fucking-

1133
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,319
Are you gonna die?

1134
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,987
I don't think so.

1135
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,239
We got to clean this up.

1136
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,241
I mean, we can't take you to the hospital

1137
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,576
because this is a gunshot wound.

1138
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:26,869
They'd have to call the police.

1139
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:27,995
I mean, it's the law.

1140
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,831
It's the law.
I know.

1141
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:31,999
Take off your pants.

1142
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,668
No.
Then I'd be in my underwear.

1143
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:35,669
Look, just do it.

1144
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,963
It's inappropriate.

1145
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:40,633
I'll get them out of here.
I won't say a thing.

1146
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,719
My God.
My hand is trembling.

1147
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,057
Okay, bye.

1148
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:51,393
Bye.
See you.

1149
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:52,728
Bye.

1150
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:53,896
Libby, are you sure

1151
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,439
you want to be here alone
with this guy?

1152
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,523
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's good.

1153
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,234
It's... something really important
came up.

1154
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,443
So I'm just gonna
deal with it.

1155
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:00,444
Yeah. You go.
Yeah.

1156
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,445
All right, good night.

1157
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,738
Okay, Christian,
you gotta go.

1158
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,739
Okay, who is that guy?

1159
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:04,907
Is that your sugar daddy?

1160
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,283
I don't have to tell you anything.

1161
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,701
You don't have to tell me anything?

1162
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,036
No.
- Okay, fine.

1163
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,830
Well, you enjoy that candy
that your sugar daddy buys you.

1164
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,624
Oh, I will.

1165
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:18,879
Wait.
What are you doing?

1166
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,089
I'm gonna get the bullet out.

1167
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,590
No.
It's clean.

1168
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:22,925
It passed clean through.

1169
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,593
No-no-no,
but there's particles-

1170
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,387
Just...

1171
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:36,021
Ow! Ow!

1172
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:38,649
[Screams]

1173
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,650
I'm sorry.

1174
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:40,734
Oh!

1175
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,777
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

1176
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,153
Oh, man!
Oh!

1177
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,155
I should have
used ibuprofens.

1178
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,740
I was gonna use ibuprofens.

1179
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,410
How were you gonna use ibuprofens?

1180
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,869
What were you gonna do with them?

1181
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,871
I'll wrap it.

1182
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,623
I'm gonna wrap it.
Here.

1183
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:55,791
No, I'll do it.

1184
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:56,792
I can...

1185
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,169
Let me do it.

1186
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:03,507
So am I the only one
that knows you're him?

1187
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,342
Yeah.

1188
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,927
No, the guys who shot me,
they know.

1189
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:09,096
They know your secret identity?

1190
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,097
Fuck!

1191
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:13,767
Yeah.
And where I live.

1192
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,978
You can stay here.

1193
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,606
Thank you.

1194
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,275
[Humming]

1195
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,526
No, I was there.

1196
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:23,736
You told me you weren't there

1197
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:24,987
when Robbie was shot.

1198
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,323
I was there maybe for a minute, not much.

1199
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,657
A minute?
- Yeah.

1200
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,326
It doesn't take a minute to get shot.

1201
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:31,785
I know, I know, but it was like,

1202
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,162
the guy was running out...

1203
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:36,165
[dramatic music]

1204
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,792
Holy crap.

1205
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,629
[Tires screech]

1206
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:53,098
Hello?

1207
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,901
Anybody home?

1208
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,905
Hello?

1209
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,470
Fuck.

1210
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:34,306
[Exhales]

1211
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,475
Shit.

1212
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,268
Welcome home, Frank.

1213
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,937
[Gunshots]

[Shells clattering]

1215
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,399
Thud!

1216
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,320
That's not him, you guys.

1217
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,696
Then why did you shoot, man?

1218
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:50,697
You shot!

1219
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,032
I saw you move your finger.

1220
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,534
You're gonna try
to blame this on me.

1221
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,701
That's fucking evil, man!

1222
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,370
Would you shut up?

1223
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,288
Ooh.
He's a cop?

1224
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,625
I just did what he did, Abe.

1225
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,627
If the cops are after Darbo,

1226
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:04,878
and he saw the dope in...

1227
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,380
Yeah, I know.

1228
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,549
So can we get the body
out of here, huh?

1229
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,551
Move it.

1230
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,053
Thanks, Hamilton.
I will.

1231
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,889
Okay.
Good-bye.

1232
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,724
Hey, Frank?

1233
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,768
I told the diner that I had pneumonia.

1234
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:22,104
You sure it's okay
if I stay here?

1235
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,772
Yeah, yeah.

1236
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,066
I want to show you something.

1237
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,987
What?

1238
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:35,242

1239

1242

Ahhh!

1243

[Grunts]

1244
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,594
So what do you think?

1245
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,929
Cartwheels.

1246
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,097
Well, you see...

1247
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,849
you see what
I'm getting at here.

1248
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,017
No.

1249
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,019
Batman had Robin.

1250
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,271
The original Human Torch
had Toro.

1251
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,857
The Flash had Kid Flash.

1252
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,567
I could be
your kid sidekick.

1253
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:09,776
How old are you?

1254
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,778
Well, I'm 22, you know.

1255
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,615
But compared to you, I'm a one.
I'm a kid, right?

1256
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,283
I guess.

1257
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,534
Right, now, look.

1258
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,453
The most important thing,
obviously, is the name.

1259
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:20,454
All right.

1260
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,622
And you got to think of it

1261
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,790
like how it sounds
with The Crimson Bolt.

1262
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,292
All right?

1263
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,669
So, um...
[exhales]

1264
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:28,962
Okay.

1265
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:33,300
The Crimson Bolt
and Bolt Girl.

1266
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:37,596
The Crimson Bolt
and Kid Crimson.

1267
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,061
The Crimson Bolt
and The Creeping Bam.

1268
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,646
What's a creeping bam?

1269
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,814
What's a toro?

1270
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,441
What the fuck is a robin?

1271
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:50,817
A robin is bird.

1272
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,319
Why is he named after a bird?

1273
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,821
Because he...

1274
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,449
he's loyal.

1275
00:58:57,575 --> 00:59:01,453
Frank, The Creeping Bam
is just this, like,

1276
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:04,456
fantastic phrase,
you know?

1277
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:05,958
And I wasn't gonna tell you before,

1278
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,042
but it's my favorite.

1279
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:08,252
Oh, it's very good.

1280
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,003
You're lying.

1281
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,588
I don't need a kid sidekick.

1282
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,048
Are you kidding me?

1283
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:14,049
No.

1284
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,175
Look what happens to you

1285
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,344
when you don't have a kid sidekick.

1286
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,180
You get shot by people.

1287
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:22,849
Frank, you team up with me,

1288
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,518
and I swear to fucking God

1289
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,187
that we will take those cocksuckers down

1290
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:28,564
that stole your wife.

1291
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,445
Frank?

1292
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,614
Yeah?

1293

[Suit squeaking]

1299
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,686
That's inappropriate.

How do I look?

1301
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,233
It's good.

1302

All right, Frank.
Let's do this.

1303
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,530
Let's go get
this Jock fucker.

1304
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,157
No.
They have guns.

1305
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,158
We're not ready yet.

1306
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,494
Oh. Okay.

1307
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,996
Well, we can fight some other crime.

1308
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,497
You know, you can show me how to do it.

1309
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,499
You can give me the one-two.

1310
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,460
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

1311
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,003
No, my leg isn't healed yet.

1312
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,921

1313
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:38,091
Come on!

1314
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,926
I should do something about this.

1315
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,762
You know what?
I'm gonna get some snacks.

1316
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:47,934
So this is what you do?

1317
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:52,314
Yeah.

1318
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,318
You just sit here
and wait for crime to happen?

1319
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,153
That's right.

This is so boring.

1325
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:17,839
We gotta find a criminal,
you know?

1326
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:20,509
We gotta go out there,
and we gotta find a criminal.

1327
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,636
We gotta teach them a lesson
that they'll never forget.

1328
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,262
Like who?

1329
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,475
Well, like this guy Jerry.

1330
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,310
He keyed my friend's car.

1331
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:31,978
I mean, he completely just...

1332
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,189
he just fucked the side of it right up.

1333
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:36,566
Whoa.
That's not cool.

1334
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,734
No, it is not.

1335
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,236
And it is illegal.

1336
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,738
And he never paid the price.

1337
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:47,786
Are you Jerry?

1338
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,830
Halloween was,
like, a month ago, bro.

1339
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,665

fucking beat evil!

You're not supposed to kill him!

1357
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:38,378
Oh, and then he'd never
key a car again, would he?

01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,046

Frank.

What?

1369
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:01,401
I didn't know
I wasn't supposed to kill him.

I mean, I'm just learning.

1371
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,404
You have to teach me these things.

1372
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,989
How am I supposed to tell crime to shut up

1373
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:06,990
if I have to shut up?

1374
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:07,991

And he was evil!

01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:24,257
Does this mean that I'm fired?

Yes.

Hey, who the fuck
do you think you're kidding?

1839
01:25:23,701 --> 01:25:25,744
You fucking stupid son of a bitch.

1840
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,579
This is not about good and evil.

1841
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:30,916
This is about,
I had her, and you didn't.

1842
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:33,252
This is about,
she loved me more

1843
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:38,632
because I am fucking interesting.

you fucking psycho.

1850

for butting into line.

1851
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,537

1852

1860
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:31,351
stabbing me to death,
is gonna change the world?

1861
01:26:31,477 --> 01:26:37,024
I can't know that for sure...

1862
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,609
unless I try.

1863
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:39,610

1868
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:49,596
So maybe you think
something's wrong with me.

1869
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:53,308
Maybe you thought I was gonna learn

1870
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:56,311
what Jacques said was true,

1871
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:58,522
that I was deluded...

1872
01:28:02,193 --> 01:28:06,405
That I was as evil
as the rest of them.

1873
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:10,075
But maybe you're the one
who needs to learn something.

1874
01:28:10,201 --> 01:28:13,578
I know how it looks.

1875
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:17,416
But sometimes how it looks
and how it is

1876
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:19,543
are two different things.

1877
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,754
The truth was in my heart.

1878
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,256
Ouch.

1879
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:26,091
I followed it...

1880
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:27,759
You okay?

1881
01:28:27,885 --> 01:28:30,762
And I saved Sarah.

1882
01:28:30,888 --> 01:28:34,266
She stayed with me
a couple months.

1883
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:36,560
They were not bad times.

1884
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:40,022
Though, they were most likely

1885
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,399
out of Sarah's sense of obligation.

1886
01:28:47,071 --> 01:28:49,448
But one morning,

1887
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:52,159
she moved on.

1888
01:28:54,078 --> 01:28:55,787
I thought it was me at the time,

1889
01:28:55,913 --> 01:28:58,457
that I was the chosen one,

1890
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:01,209
but it was Sarah all along.

1891
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,879
And that's why I needed to save her.

1892
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:08,550
She needed to finish school,
to study anthropology,

1893
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:10,635
because Sarah knows something about people.

1894
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:12,971
We're not able to even feel
the love that...

1895
01:29:13,097 --> 01:29:15,140
She needed to go back to her meetings,

1896
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:17,809
where she had insights
that struck others uniquely.

1897
01:29:17,935 --> 01:29:19,811
"FINE" means,
"Fucked up, Insecure,

1898
01:29:19,937 --> 01:29:22,647
Neurotic, and Emotional."

1899
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:24,649
And sometimes she needed to have nightmares

1900
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:28,320
of those ugly times at Jacques' ranch.

1901
01:29:31,824 --> 01:29:35,202
Because a kind man,
a man who was good

1902
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:37,204
and didn't know it,

1903
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:42,209
needed to learn how to comfort someone.

1904
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:45,504
And maybe most of all,
Sarah needed to have

1905
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:50,342
Patrick and Trevor and Laura and Joy,

1906
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:53,512
four children who probably
wouldn't be at all

1907
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:56,681
if Libby and I hadn't gone
to Jacques' ranch that night.

1908
01:29:56,808 --> 01:30:02,396
Maybe,
if all of us are lucky,

1909
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:05,732
they're the ones
who are gonna change the world.

1910

and something much more.
