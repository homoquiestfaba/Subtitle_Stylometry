1
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:28,612
Love. I mean, as in romantic love.

2
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,906
That's what we're gonna
study today, class.

3
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,743
We're gonna ask ourselves
that age-old question,

4
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,120
where exactly does love come from?

5
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:40,166
Now, most of us in this classroom
have experienced some degree of love.

6
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,876
At least I hope you have.

7
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,504
But if not, I'm sure you've been exposed
to the expressions of love

8
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:52,261
in poems, songs, plays, books, movies,

9
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:57,099
in celebrations, in tragedies,
or passionate dance.

10
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,312
However, no matter what we've experienced,

11
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,106
or how beautifully
it's been described to us,

12
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,109
like some mysterious force of the spirit,

13
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:11,071
no one has ever explained what ignites
those passionate flames of love.

14
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,910
At least they haven't
explained it scientifically.

15
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,937
Could it be a peculiar way
our potential mate walks or talks?

16
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,772
Or maybe, just maybe,

17
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,857
it has nothing to do with them at all.

18
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,409
So, somehow, Cupid smiles upon us

19
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:59,411
and shoots his arrow through our heart,

20
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:02,414
and... we get the reward.

21
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,577
Any questions?

22
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:24,580
No? No. Shocking.

23
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,083
All right, folks, get out there
and get that reward!

24
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,002
'Cause that's what it's all about, right?

25
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,504
And I will see you on Thursday.

26
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:35,925
And Friday.

27
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,968
And every day, 'cause I love you.

28
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,470
Go get them.

29
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,640
Professor, he's a little odd,
don't you think?

30
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,225
Who, Grimes? No, he seems normal.
What are you talking about?

31
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:49,396
I don't know. He's not very professional,
and kind of goofy.

32
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,190
You say "goofy" like that's a bad thing.

33
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,108
I'm goofy.

34
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:54,693
That's different.

35
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,320
You're my boyfriend, not my professor.

36
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,615
I mean, making fun of animals having sex?

37
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:01,825
Speaking of which,

38
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,328
how about we go back to your place
for some of that mad monkey love?

39
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,412
Shut up.

40
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,082
Miss Ellis?

41
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,584
Yeah?

42
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,211
Can I speak to you for a second, please?

43
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,630
Sure.

44
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,010
You need to call me.

45
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,431
-I do, do I?
-Yeah, you do.

46
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,808
You have a name?

47
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,518
You'll learn everything about me tonight,

48
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,395
over drinks, my place.

49
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,983
Well, whoever you are, I'm sorry,

50
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,151
but I'm already involved with somebody.

51
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,569
Oh, of course.

52
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,571
I'm sure you are involved
with someone else,

53
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:42,491
but that's only because
you haven't been with me yet.

54
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,701
I'll take that.

55
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:48,205
Listen, asshole, I don't know
what you've been smoking,

56
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,623
but I'll tell you right now,

57
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,084
there is no way
I'll ever hook up with you.

58
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,294
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

59
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,425
Sorry about the cock block, bro.

60
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,260
Hey, man, she's all yours.

61
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,724
What'd you need, Professor Grimes?

62
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,644
Please don't call me that,
"Professor Grimes".

63
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:14,148
No, that puts way too much pressure on me
to actually know a lot of stuff.

64
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,482
Billy's fine.

65
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,777
Okay, Billy.

66
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,572
I see you submitted an application

67
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,449
for teacher's assistant
in this department.

68
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,533
Aren't you a first year?

69
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,286
Yeah, I know it's a long shot and all,

70
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,204
being a first year, but I thought I'd...

71
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,622
No, no, no, that's okay. I...

72
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,709
I just recently transferred
to this university myself.

73
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,586
So, technically, I'm a first year as well.

74
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,254
And I like first year assistants

75
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,341
because they don't know enough
to know that I don't know enough.

76
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,012
Do you have a second,
can you to talk me in my office?

77
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,265
Just a second.

78
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,393
Yeah, I have a minute.

79
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,187
Come on.

80
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,984
Okay, so that would basically
make us both outsiders,

81
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:02,029
which, you know, it could be a good thing.

82
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,655
At least for my research.

83
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:07,451
Considering it's primarily, you know,
thinking outside of the box,

84
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,621
at least as far as
the neurological community is concerned,

85
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:13,082
What is it you're researching?

86
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,920
That is information that is for me
and my research team,

87
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,963
which I hope to have you a part of soon.

88
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,215
But before we can do that,

89
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,425
I need to get
your inoculation shots updated.

90
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,677
Inoculation shots?

91
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:31,141
Does your research have something to do
with some new infection or, like, virus

92
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,392
I should I be worried about?

93
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:35,604
Not really.

94
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,856
No, this is more, like, insurance stuff.

95
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,692
Bureaucratic red tape. That sort of thing.

96
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,612
You know, you have to have
your health records updated, right?

97
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,989
TB, hepatitis, that sort of thing.

98
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,035
Anyway, I want you to go down
to the health clinic tomorrow morning.

99
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,621
You better get there kind of early
because it gets very crowded.

100
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,915
Gets clamoring for free flu vaccines

101
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,334
and, you know, birth control pills,
that sort of thing.

102
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,045
Go ask for a guy named Miller, okay?

103
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,964
He's gonna take you
right to the front of the line.

104
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,508
Who is Miller?

105
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,512
Miller is my rather rotund assistant.

106
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:11,974
How many assistants do you have?

107
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,060
Pretty much just Miller.

108
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:17,521
Yeah, but he's pretty advanced
in his training.

109
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,232
So, I've got him handling
most of the ugly stuff.

110
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,568
Like giving out the shots.

111
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,446
Yeah, like giving out the shots.

112
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:32,411
You know, I know it would be
a great opportunity

113
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:33,745
to work with you, professor.

114
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,290
Really.

115
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,835
But I would really have to know more
about your research

116
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:40,961
before I could commit.

117
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,760
I'm sorry, but I have got to go.

118
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,430
That's okay. I understand.

119
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,933
I mean, committing all your spare time

120
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:57,102
to a project that you know
absolutely nothing about,

121
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,645
I doubt I can do that either.

122
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,856
But I will tell you this.

123
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,902
This project is gonna make this planet
a much better place to live in.

124
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,278
That's a promise.

125
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:10,073
So, in case you don't get
any better offers, or whatever,

126
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,325
you take this.

127
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,285
Call me.

128
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,039
Oh, Ms. Ellis.

129
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,762
I'm just a little nervous about this, Sam.

130
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:32,846
That's all I'm saying.

131
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,182
Alan, no one forced you
to accept my offer to move in.

132
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,309
I know that.

133
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,645
Then what are you whining about?

134
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,441
I don't know, I...

135
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,486
I abandoned
a really sweet living situation.

136
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,614
I wouldn't call sleeping
on a dorm room floor

137
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,492
with three guys addicted
to beer and video games,

138
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,369
"a really sweet living situation".

139
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,080
Yeah, it had its advantages.

140
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,668
Advantages being what?

141
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,837
Waking up next to them
instead of waking up next to me?

142
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,425
No, course not.

143
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:13,428
All I'm just saying is, you know,
it allowed for us to have a place to go

144
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,347
be by ourselves every now and then.
That's all.

145
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,519
Well, I'm sure your ex-roommates
will let you visit.

146
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,022
Sam...

147
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,611
this just seems kind of rushed,
that's all I'm saying.

148
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,947
I mean, are we being rational about this?

149
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,323
Are you a hundred percent sure?

150
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,163
A hundred percent sure
about living with you full time?

151
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,042
No, I'm not.

152
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,212
And since when does love
have to be rational?

153
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,880
It'd be kind of boring, don't you think?

154
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,926
Anyway, the point is...

155
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:55,971
the point is...

156
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,061
I am so deeply in love with you,

157
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:09,151
and this is so odd for me
to say this to anybody, but...

158
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:16,783
I'm just so incredibly immersed
in your soul,

159
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:21,330
your aura, your whatever,
that when we are apart, it...

160
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:27,002
it's like my world is a little darker,
a little dimmer,

161
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:32,591
a little more... well, lonely.

162
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,763
Really?

163
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,514
Yeah.

164
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:44,394
I mean, you said you felt the same way
about me, didn't you?

165
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,939
Yeah, but, damn, I didn't...

166
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,567
I didn't put it as cool as you just did.

167
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,864
So, forget being a hundred percent sure,

168
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,575
and stop having
these stupid frat boy panic attacks,

169
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,160
and grow up.

170
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:05,457
And just enjoy us being together,
while we are together.

171
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:06,958
Okay?

172
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,549
Okay.

173
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,802
You know, who knows?

174
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,429
I might get sick of your cologne,

175
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,640
and throw your ass back on that floor
with your buddies.

176
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,434
-Really?
-Yeah.

177
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:27,437
You know, and then you'll miss out
on the best part of moving in with me.

178
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,106
Oh, yeah?

179
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,067
What's the best part
of moving in with you?

180
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:36,238
Well, why don't you
take a guess, smart guy?

181
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,283
Mad monkey love?

182
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,579
Young man, you just got an A.

183
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,213
What?

184
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,216
What do you mean "what"?

185
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,469
Something's bothering you. What is it?

186
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,305
How do you know something's bothering me?

187
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,517
Because whenever
something's bothering you,

188
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,227
you just lie there looking at the ceiling.

189
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,020
Really?

190
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,356
Yeah, really.

191
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,024
So, you want to tell me?

192
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:19,281
I got an offer today
to be a teacher's assistant.

193
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,117
Wait, isn't that supposed to be
a good thing?

194
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,078
I mean, you've been hoping for that
for your résumé.

195
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,166
Yeah, but it's with Professor Grimes.

196
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,085
So what's wrong with that?
He seems pretty cool.

197
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,087
Not really.

198
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:40,635
I don't know, there's something...
something I don't trust about him.

199
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,972
He gives me this weird vibe

200
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,433
like... like there's something else
going on,

201
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,729
something... something not so nice.

202
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,649
Well, maybe you're just scared
of the unknown.

203
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,528
I mean, do you always have to know
one hundred percent

204
00:12:58,612 --> 00:12:59,863
what someone's motives are?

205
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,450
I mean, everybody has got
some kind of mystery to them.

206
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,704
When did you get so deep?

207
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,666
Sorry, I know how you prefer
your men dumb and all that.

208
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,127
Well, yeah, I like them dumb and cute.

209
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,254
So, I guess one out of two ain't bad.

210
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:26,181
Excuse me! Excuse me... Hello!
Excuse me. Hello... Excuse me!

211
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,767
Shit, I don't believe this.

212
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,062
I just... I just ran into this long line
at the clinic,

213
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,231
and I have to meet Jeff in half an hour.

214
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,482
Hey, Erika.

215
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,026
Come here. I'll take you.

216
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:40,654
I'll call you back.

217
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,459
How you doing?

218
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,795
Can you please not talk to me?

219
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,592
Oh, this shot is not administered
in the arm.

220
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,303
You've got to be kidding me.

221
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,889
I don't kid when it comes to science.

222
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:11,059
Well, listen, you are not putting that
in my ass.

223
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,187
I bet I'm the first guy
you ever told that to.

224
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,065
Check this picture out.

225
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:21,653
This is what the virus is capable of doing
to your genitalia and anus.

226
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,621
So, turn around, drop your pants,

227
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,039
and bend over the table.

228
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:54,978
Hi. Do you know where I can find
someone named Miller?

229
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,235
-Did that hurt?
-Yes, it fucking hurts!

230
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,653
Oh, sorry, wrong cheek.

231
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:04,821
What do you mean wrong...

232
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,498
-Hi! Are you Miller?
-That's me.

233
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,666
Professor Grimes sent me.

234
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,003
Oh, yeah, you must be Sam.

235
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,087
Yeah, he just called,

236
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,381
he said you decided to be
his assistant with me.

237
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,175
-Yeah.
-Cool.

238
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,844
Hey, can you give me a minute?
I need to finish up in here first.

239
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,724
Oh, we're not done yet.

240
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,352
-What?
-There's one more procedure.

241
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,355
What? No way! My ass is on fire.

242
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,358
Oh, we'll talk about that later.

243
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,234
But this is for your nose.

244
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,361
My nose?

245
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,251
Sure you don't want me
to take you back to the clinic.

246
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,088
No, it's just a reaction
to the inoculations.

247
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:04,714
It'll pass.

248
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,633
Is your arm still sore from the shot?

249
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:11,805
Not as much as my head,
like around my sinuses.

250
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,264
Your sinuses?

251
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,393
Yeah, they gave me
some kind of nasal spray.

252
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,353
What for?

253
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:20,897
I don't know.

254
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,400
He said it was a new procedure.

255
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,195
He was kind of creepy,
I didn't really care,

256
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,863
I just wanted to get out of there.

257
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:33,952
You'll be okay.

258
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,537
Are you sure?

259
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,247
I'm here. I'm not leaving you.

260
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,416
-Promise?
-I promise.

261
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,005
So, when I didn't see you last week,

262
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,508
I thought you'd probably changed
your mind or something.

263
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,926
I was kind of sick.

264
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,053
Nothing serious, I hope.

265
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:53,930
Not at all.

266
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,224
I think it was just a mild reaction
to the nasal spray.

267
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,854
ChemiTrope?

268
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:05,525
Wow, they're like the largest
medical research company on the planet.

269
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,444
Are you involved with them?

270
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,570
Not officially.

271
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,739
You know, they're always trying
to get me caught up

272
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,074
in their "corporate BS",
but don't worry about that right now.

273
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,951
Before we get started,

274
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,828
I just wanna make sure
we're clear on one thing.

275
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,747
You know, whatever takes place
here in the lab,

276
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,582
has to stay here in the lab.

277
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,667
Well, that's standard procedure,
Professor Grimes...

278
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,461
Billy.

279
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,715
Right, just making sure
we're on the same page.

280
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:37,307
Wow, this is quite a lab.

281
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,477
Pretty different
from the other ones on campus.

282
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,979
It works. You know, it does its job.

283
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:48,860
So, can I explain what I'm doing?

284
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,488
My research concerns love

285
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:55,033
and the scientific basis behind it.

286
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,580
Well, that's a lofty goal.

287
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,165
Yes, it is.

288
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,959
But I've been interested in what it is

289
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,670
that makes one person to fall in love

290
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,715
and another to not, you know,
that sort of thing.

291
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:12,342
If you could figure that out,

292
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,469
you'd be, like, the richest person
in the world.

293
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:19,057
It was that, but, you know,
to tell you the truth,

294
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:23,061
my relationships always end up
kind of sad, you know?

295
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:27,607
A little bit... pretty much like...
close to the people out there.

296
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:29,692
And I just...

297
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,987
wanted to figure out...

298
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,406
what that is, you know?

299
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,867
What is it that makes us choose
one partner?

300
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,788
Or what it is that chooses that for us.

301
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,583
That'd be nice to know.

302
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,502
It certainly would.

303
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,754
What about you? Are you in a relationship?

304
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,883
Yeah, I just started one.

305
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,261
And how is that going?

306
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,556
Great.

307
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,558
Just great?

308
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,567
Well, it's an incredibly
fantastic relationship.

309
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:16,030
You think it's gonna remain
incredibly fantastic forever?

310
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,743
I don't know.

311
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,581
Incredibly fantastic is a good start,
don't you think?

312
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,208
Certainly is.

313
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:32,672
And wouldn't it be cool if it remained
incredibly fantastic forever?

314
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,508
Or at least as long
as you choose it to be?

315
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:40,722
Yeah, that...

316
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,266
that would be pretty cool.

317
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,060
That would be very cool.

318
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,905
Okay.

319
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,574
I got to get to the library,
I got some research to do.

320
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,659
But why don't you
make yourself acquainted?

321
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,746
And, if you're not here when I get back,
I'll see you Friday.

322
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:06,998
Okay.

323
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,710
Okay.

324
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,933
Well, that would have been hot sex...

325
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,352
if I were a necrophiliac.

326
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:28,978
Sorry.

327
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,023
You wanna tell me what's going on?

328
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,150
Or rather, what's not going on?

329
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,403
I don't know.

330
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,909
I'm just not feeling it.

331
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,580
"It"? You're not feeling it?

332
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,502
What, our sex life
gets some kind of demotion

333
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:58,174
from mad monkey love to... to "it"?

334
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:25,535
Hey, sex runs hot and cold.

335
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,329
However, in my case, sex has been cold
for a long time now.

336
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,999
Even when I'm by myself,
I tend to fall asleep during...

337
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,125
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

338
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,585
I don't need that image
in my head right now.

339
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:35,837
My bad.

340
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,131
What about him?

341
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,428
Is he your type?

342
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,516
Well, he's tall, good-looking,

343
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,059
zero body fat.

344
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,270
No, not my type at all.

345
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:55,732
You see, the same rules apply
in the gay world.

346
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,192
Hotties like him hookup
with other hotties,

347
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:00,153
but non-hotties like me hook up with...

348
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,947
well, we hook up alone.

349
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:06,743
Thomas, how many times have I told you
about that out of your league stuff, man?

350
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,870
You just got to go for it. I always do.

351
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,997
I know, and I did, at the gym.

352
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,081
I said "hello",

353
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:15,043
but he must have some kind
of super gaydar,

354
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,253
and just said told me he was straight
and walked away.

355
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,838
So what, man?

356
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,758
Play the odds. Ask every hot guy you meet.

357
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,217
And someone will say yes.

358
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:24,427
Wait a minute.

359
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,513
Why should I take advice
on being confident from you?

360
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:32,143
A guy who's stressing over a girl
like some little schoolboy?

361
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,229
I mean, just one night Sam's not
in the mood for sex,

362
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,148
and you're all of a sudden
having a panic attack.

363
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,484
No, it wasn't that she was just not
in the mood for sex,

364
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,570
she didn't even respond to anything
that had to do with me,

365
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,864
it was like I was an unwelcome guest
or something.

366
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:47,700
Is it that time of the month?

367
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:49,994
No.

368
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,746
Trust me, that's never an issue with her.

369
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,707
I don't know I just get
this weird vibe like she's...

370
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,710
I don't know she's into someone else.

371
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,296
Great, now you are paranoid.

372
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,466
Well, I mean, she has been
spending a lot of time

373
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,052
helping one of her professors
with his research project.

374
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:09,097
Dude, listen to me,
you are totally falling apart here.

375
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,308
And I think it's because,
for the first time in your life,

376
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,477
you've made a big commitment to one girl,

377
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,355
and you're worried
you've made a big mistake.

378
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:20,358
Which leads to doubts,
which leads to suspicion

379
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:23,820
that she's... fucking her professor
or something.

380
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:26,906
You think she is?

381
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:31,077
Okay, before I lose
all respect for you as a man,

382
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,203
just do this.

383
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,623
Girls are big
into the whole nesting thing.

384
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:38,084
So, go home, clean the place up,

385
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,503
fix her a nice dinner,
and she'll be back to normal.

386
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,130
I can't cook.

387
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:44,841
Doesn't matter.

388
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,051
Order a takeout, then say you made it.

389
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:50,638
The point is, this is just a little bump
in the relationship road,

390
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,558
and you've got to learn how
to deal with it without getting paranoid.

391
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,977
And you know all about
how relationships work because?

392
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,855
I watch Oprah.

393
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:20,042
It's just you and me, pal.

394
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:50,323
Yeah, baby! Yeah, Erika.

395
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,033
Yeah.

396
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:56,787
Kiss your daddy.
Kiss your daddy, baby. Yes!

397
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,374
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!

398
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:03,753
Right there. Right there. Oh, yeah.

399
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,923
That's right. baby. Oh, yeah, Erika.

400
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:17,850
Yeah, Erika.

401
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:58,724
Hey.

402
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,310
Hey.

403
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,148
What's this?

404
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,819
Just thought I'd get us a nice dinner.

405
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:13,572
Sort of a thank you for asking me
to move in and everything.

406
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:19,495
I'm sorry, but you didn't you me
you had plans.

407
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:22,873
I'm sorry, too, you didn't tell me
you were going to work late

408
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,000
with your professor.

409
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,253
I don't think I like that tone, Alan.

410
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,921
And what tone is that?

411
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:33,009
Childish, hostile, accusatory?

412
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:34,802
Let me know if I missed something.

413
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,597
No, you're right.
I am all those things right now.

414
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:42,685
But being that way fits this situation.

415
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,981
I have no dignity left,

416
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,108
I might as well ask you.

417
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:54,530
Are you messing around
with your professor?

418
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,744
If you are asking me
whether I'm fucking him or not,

419
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:00,828
the answer is no.

420
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,335
How dare you confront me
like some jealous teenage boyfriend.

421
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,755
That's what I am,
I mean, I'm not some teenager,

422
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,214
but we live together, Sam,

423
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:15,509
and jealousy... jealousy feels
rather appropriate.

424
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:16,927
I'm not talking.

425
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:18,429
-Sam.
-What?

426
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,557
I don't particularly like all this drama,
but I got to know, straight out.

427
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:26,562
Are you even thinking about
messing around with your professor?

428
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:31,942
I don't like coming into my apartment...

429
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,944
Sam, you didn't answer the question.

430
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,447
Now, I need to know.

431
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:41,243
Are you messing around
with your professor or not?

432
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:53,047
You know, you said you wanted me
to move in here

433
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,257
because you wanted
to build this cool relationship.

434
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,181
I know.

435
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,141
Then what happened between you and him?

436
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:08,771
I don't know what happened between us.

437
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,650
It's just, when I'm around him,

438
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,152
I get this nice feeling.

439
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,906
So, basically, everything you said
about us, about me,

440
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,574
it was just all... it was all bullshit?

441
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:24,620
No, no. No, I meant what I said
about you, I swear.

442
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,205
Oh, if you swear,

443
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,624
then how could you just go be
with somebody else, Sam?

444
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,635
You want me to move out?

445
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:48,477
I don't know.

446
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:51,689
You want me to stay?

447
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,450
Fuck me.

448
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:14,462
Jeez. I always thought
that romantic dinner thing

449
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:15,713
would actually work.

450
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:17,840
I might have to sue Oprah.

451
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:22,011
Yeah, I don't get it, man.

452
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,722
It doesn't make sense to me, you know?

453
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:28,726
It's like, she said
that she was so in love with me,

454
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:29,977
so happy,

455
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,980
making all these plans,
talking about the future.

456
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:37,401
And then one day, she meets her
one of her professors, and that's it.

457
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:39,111
You know? We're no more.

458
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,198
This is kind of sad, man.

459
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:46,952
I mean, a confident ladies' man
like yourself falling apart like this.

460
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:51,248
Maybe finally getting dumped by someone
is some sort of

461
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:54,543
karmic payback, or something like that.

462
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,794
No.

463
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:59,548
I've been dumped plenty of times, man,
believe me.

464
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:02,510
It's usually because I screwed up
or the girl was psycho.

465
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:04,512
But this...

466
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,227
this is too bizarre, man.

467
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,897
I mean, I was the perfect boyfriend.

468
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,567
No way I could've read her wrong.

469
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,488
And that she would dump me
for one of her professors,

470
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,865
a guy that weirded her out.

471
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:28,744
I mean, she said there was something
about him she didn't even trust.

472
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,376
He doesn't matter.

473
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,337
Whether you did right or wrong
doesn't matter.

474
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:41,423
What matters is, she left.

475
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:44,885
And you need to man up.

476
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:55,563
Hey, Thomas.

477
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,398
What do you want, Roger?

478
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:01,402
No... Nothing, I was just...
I was passing by, and I...

479
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,280
I was wondering if you're busy,
or anything right now.

480
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,283
'Cause, I just thought I saw someone,
a guy come in here,

481
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:08,784
and I was wondering if...

482
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:10,911
You are such a slut!

483
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:16,959
Well, that was embarrassing.

484
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,210
Sorry.

485
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:19,295
What was his problem?

486
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:23,007
When I first moved in here,
I gave a housewarming party,

487
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,593
invited everyone
from the Computer Department.

488
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,262
I proceeded to get incredibly drunk,

489
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:31,807
and he and I ended up, you know.

490
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:34,184
With him?

491
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,478
He's right, you are a slut.

492
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,566
Yeah, me, a slut, who would've thunk?

493
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:44,278
Unfortunately, when I told him
it was just a one-night thing,

494
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,155
he went psycho stalker,

495
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,866
moved right across the hall
where he can keep an eye on me.

496
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,121
I hope you don't plan on going off
on Sam like that.

497
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,875
Don't worry, I'm so not like that.

498
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:08,510
You know, it might not have anything
to do with me or Sam.

499
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:13,223
Might have something to do
with that professor, Professor Grimes.

500
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:17,770
Okay, you're beginning to scare me.

501
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:18,979
Look, just do me a favor.

502
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,773
Oh, no.

503
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:24,276
Just use whatever magical computer powers
you have and just check into him,

504
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,028
-on the professor.
-Oh, Alan, come on.

505
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,780
Come on, just do me
this one little favor, man,

506
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:31,033
and if everything checks out,
I'm so done with Sam.

507
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:33,952
I find that hard to believe.

508
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:37,581
Who knows? I might go gay.

509
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:41,502
Great, more competition for the hot guys.

510
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:49,176
So who are we to question what... wants?

511
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,471
What chemistry brings together?

512
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:57,518
And isn't there some sort of natural order
to things that we don't understand anyway?

513
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,937
Nor do we even to understand?

514
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:07,528
So, I ask you, and I ask you,
and I ask you, and I ask all of you.

515
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:13,075
Who are we to question
what nature desires?

516
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:16,328
And please believe me, folks.

517
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:18,330
This world never suffered so much

518
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:20,666
since us humans decided to come down
from the trees

519
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:24,628
and used our opposable thumbs
to develop technology.

520
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:27,840
Think about that.

521
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,802
And we will discuss thumbs next week.

522
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:35,806
I want you to read chapters 10 through 13
over the weekend.

523
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:39,017
And keep the wheels spinning, folks, okay?

524
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,854
Had a good time today. I'll see you later.

525
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:47,776
Sam.

526
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:51,780
Alan, it's good to see you.

527
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:53,449
How have you been?

528
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,201
I'm okay, considering the breakup
and everything.

529
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,412
You gonna be okay?

530
00:33:58,495 --> 00:33:59,496
Yeah, I'll be fine.

531
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,875
I just wonder when I could get
the rest of my stuff?

532
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:06,462
Anytime. Just call before you come.

533
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,921
Why?

534
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:11,216
You'll have company?

535
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,220
I really hope you get over this, Alan.

536
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,930
How can you get over this so fast?

537
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:18,849
You were the one
that wanted us to get together.

538
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,100
I know that.

539
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,771
Look, I'm really happy now,
isn't that important?

540
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,189
No.

541
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,358
I mean, I'm not happy.

542
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:30,861
Sam, you ready?

543
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:37,409
Billy, this is Alan.

544
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:39,870
Oh, hey.

545
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:43,791
Sam has said some wonderful things
about you.

546
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,587
Mustn't have been too wonderful,
seeing how she dumped me for you.

547
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,259
Okay.

548
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:57,805
That's an uncomfortable moment.

549
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:00,474
I'm gonna let you two...

550
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:05,395
Listen.

551
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:08,816
She's worried about you, okay?

552
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,401
And quite frankly, so am I.

553
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,195
You're worried about me?

554
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:15,948
I'm fine. I should be worried
about you two.

555
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:18,242
Why would you be worried about us?

556
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,579
Because you... Well, because.

557
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,043
Why didn't you make other friends
when you were growing up?

558
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:12,129
Man, just one more night,
I promise, never again.

559
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:13,589
Right, "never again."

560
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,382
Look, why don't I just give you
an extra key

561
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,259
for when you never do this again?

562
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,224
You know, I had some time,

563
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:26,602
so I actually did a search
on your competition.

564
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:29,521
Who?

565
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,648
Professor Love Rocket.

566
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,483
Sam's new bang buddy.

567
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,110
"Bang buddy," nice.

568
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,695
Listen, it's kind of interesting.

569
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:41,575
I found a lot of information about him
as classified by ChemiTrope.

570
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,160
ChemiTrope?

571
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,121
Yeah, well...

572
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,416
Well, did you hack into it?

573
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:53,378
Right, Alan, I'm going to try
and break into one the biggest,

574
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:55,380
most secure computer networks
in the world,

575
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:56,924
risk being thrown in prison,

576
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:59,760
just so you can learn more
about who's banging your ex-girlfriend?

577
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,597
-Well, did you break in or not?
-Yeah, of course, I did.

578
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,564
I mean, ChemiTrope recruits nerds
out of my computer department.

579
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,985
In fact, Moogie and Joe,
a couple of guys I used to party with,

580
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:19,905
were hired to redesign
ChemiTrope's whole security system.

581
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:22,240
Moogie and Joe?

582
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,618
Yeah, Moogie and Joe got hired
by ChemiTrope

583
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,828
based upon the algorithms I came up with.

584
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,581
So, if I can compromise their work

585
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:31,917
and tell ChemiTrope about it,

586
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,337
I will get a little payback,
it will look good on a résumé,

587
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,798
and ChemiTrope might replace them with me.

588
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:38,882
Yeah, that's great.

589
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,926
But did you find out anything
about the professor?

590
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,845
Well, it's kind of interesting,
ChemiTrope's official website,

591
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,847
there's just one mention of Grimes,

592
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,517
but that link is heavily secured
on a shadow network.

593
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,937
So, when I probe deeper...

594
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,149
Shit, are you going to get in trouble?

595
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,443
Me? No way. I'm completely stealth.

596
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:02,823
Here it is.

597
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:06,868
At his last job, there was this
one incident with a female student,

598
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,578
apparently caused quite a controversy.

599
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:14,084
-Wow.
-What? "Wow", what?

600
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,586
Got her pregnant? He killed her? What?

601
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,255
They shut me out of the system.

602
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,007
I've never been shut out of any system.

603
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,768
Well, how are we gonna find out
about this female student?

604
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:37,774
I don't know, but I got to admit,
for totally egotistical reasons,

605
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:41,445
I hate the thought of Moogie
and Joe developing any kind of system

606
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:43,989
I can't compromise, so...

607
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,496
Take this modified thumb drive.

608
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,832
It will give us a backdoor connection
to his data files.

609
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:57,419
Just plug it into an empty port
anywhere behind Grimes computer.

610
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,545
Like this.

611
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:02,758
What? Break into his office?
Are you kidding me?

612
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,510
Look, if you're serious
about finding out about this guy,

613
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:07,345
then you got to take some risks.

614
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:11,600
With this, we can suck out
every bit of information he has, okay?

615
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,310
And...

616
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:20,150
I programmed this card to open up
pretty much every security door on campus.

617
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,735
It should get you into his office.

618
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,990
This pretty much makes me a stalker,
doesn't it?

619
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:30,243
Oh, this is well beyond stalking,
my friend.

620
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:33,080
You are totally pushing the envelope
of psychotic behavior.

621
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,918
Well, if you're not gonna go
all the way, why go at all, right?

622
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:47,636
Erika, what?

623
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:57,562
Do you know how long
I've been waiting for you?

624
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,442
-It's about time!
-Erika, what the fuck are you doing here?

625
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:04,903
-Where have you been?
-Where the fuck have I been?

626
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:07,114
Where the fuck you get the nerve
to ask me that question?

627
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:08,824
You fucking someone else, huh?

628
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,826
Oh, listen.

629
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,120
You know what, you got
the fucking bad case of the crazies

630
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:14,287
or something, you know that?

631
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:15,455
Shut up!

632
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:05,714
You know, it's weird,
I definitely got a creep vibe

633
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,174
from being around that professor.

634
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:10,552
And I'm sure it has nothing to do
with him banging your ex.

635
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,221
There's other words besides "banging".

636
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:14,764
But they are not as colorful.

637
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:15,932
You find anything?

638
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,351
Nothing out of the ordinary.

639
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,145
Kind of boring stuff.

640
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:25,150
Lectures, homework assignments,
something called Cupid's Arrow.

641
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,445
What? Let me see that.

642
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:31,823
Wow, talk about information overload.

643
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,910
There must be over a thousand files.
Where do we start?

644
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:36,369
I don't know.

645
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:41,750
A lot of the files
are cryptically encoded.

646
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,378
Wow, looks like Moogie
and Joe's programming.

647
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:47,881
It would take a while to break it,
I can tell you that.

648
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:52,177
But it looks like
some of these files are open.

649
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,637
Like these pictures.

650
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,474
Why does that somehow look pornographic?

651
00:41:57,933 --> 00:41:59,809
It's an animal's vomeronasal organ.

652
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:01,561
We studied it in class.

653
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,356
Grimes called it "the Cupid's gland".

654
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:07,943
It turns airborne pheromones
into signals that trigger the sex drive.

655
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,654
It's kinda like when a dog...
when a dog's in heat,

656
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:12,072
you know, that kind of thing.

657
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:15,742
What?

658
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,371
I just never pegged you as someone
who could pay attention in class,

659
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,289
let alone retain anything you'd hear.

660
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:22,582
Thanks.

661
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:25,210
Open that one, the one
that says "TRP2 movie file".

662
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:32,342
Pheromone receptor, TRP2,

663
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:35,845
ion channel gene, cloned from a gerbil.

664
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,527
Oh, my god. He's done it.

665
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,614
Done what? What is all this?

666
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:57,325
He's cloned Cupid's Arrow.

667
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:04,499
Grimes has hijacked the circuitry
that causes people to fall in love.

668
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,420
No way!

669
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:10,880
According to this data, yes way.

670
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:18,763
Sam. Search "female subjects".

671
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:30,775
Well, this is kind of creepy.

672
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:32,986
She's not there.

673
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:36,364
-Who?
-Sam. Why isn't she there?

674
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:43,163
Wait, you think the nutty professor
pumped your ex

675
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:44,998
full of this love juice,

676
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:48,043
and that's what made her dump you
and jump in the bed with him?

677
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,546
Yeah, I kind of think he did.

678
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:04,809
You know, you chemistry majors
are stranger than any computer geek

679
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:06,019
I've ever known.

680
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:10,607
I mean, we deal in intangibles,
like internet porn!

681
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,193
But, you Doctor Frankensteins

682
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:17,989
deal in weird, disturbing science fiction
mutations and crap.

683
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:19,157
What's your problem, Thomas?

684
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,825
We need to figure out
what's going on here.

685
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:22,619
I do know what's going on.

686
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:25,622
An uber corporation like ChemiTrope
is involved

687
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:30,293
in weird illegal experiments
on human love glands.

688
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:32,879
I mean, come on, Alan,
that's some fucked up shit.

689
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:34,923
-You're forgetting about Sam.
-Sam?

690
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,425
You're talking about helping out
your ex-girlfriend?

691
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:38,843
Thomas, she might be in danger.

692
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:41,471
The same ex-girlfriend
who's now fucking her teacher?

693
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:43,181
Is that the girl you want me to risk

694
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:45,725
being erased
by ChemiTrope's private security?

695
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,604
You're on your own.

696
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:51,106
What's wrong with you, man?

697
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,274
-I quit.
-Oh, fuck.

698
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,110
Thomas!

699
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,535
What?

700
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:18,299
Sam.

701
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:20,176
Alan, what are you doing here?

702
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:22,512
Look, I know it's really late.
I know it seems weird.

703
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,305
Can you just give me a second, please?

704
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:25,515
Can we just... Sam!

705
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:28,184
-Don't ever lay a hand on me.
-Okay. All right. All right. I'm sorry.

706
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:31,104
Just give me a second.
Just hear me out, please.

707
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:32,272
What?

708
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:35,275
Grimes has been experimenting
on pheromones.

709
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,194
What is that?

710
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:40,572
It's information from Grimes
computer, about his research.

711
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:41,656
Alan, you...

712
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,741
-Did you break into his computer?
-That's not the point.

713
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:46,453
He's gone off the fucking deep end.
He's been experimenting on humans.

714
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:49,372
No, Alan. You've gone off the deep end
by breaking into somebody's computer

715
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:50,457
in jealous rage.

716
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,958
Okay, Sam, look.

717
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,878
I think there's a good chance
that he's experimented on you.

718
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,338
I think he's given you some serum
that made you fall in love

719
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:59,966
or at least, seem like you feel in love.

720
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:08,183
Love potion, eh?

721
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,352
You know, no offense, Sam.

722
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,980
But if I did have such a, such a serum,

723
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:17,233
I would have possibly shared it
with the entire cheerleading squad.

724
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:18,735
You know what I'm saying?

725
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,613
I'll be inside.

726
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,951
First thing tomorrow, I'm getting
a restraining order against you.

727
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:30,246
and if you ever bother me again,
I will have you thrown in jail.

728
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,837
Okay, how long ago?

729
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,423
No, I'm here now.

730
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:43,593
Okay. Just call me if,

731
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:45,720
if you got any problems,
just call me, okay?

732
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,888
Thank you.

733
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:50,266
What's this thing about some bleach?

734
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,185
I was in a middle of a massage.

735
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:55,188
Not bleach. Okay, genius?

736
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:57,148
Breach.
We got a little breach of security.

737
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:58,942
So go down to your lab
and wait for some help.

738
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,485
What do you mean help?

739
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,446
I just spoke to some people who're gonna
a scan on the computers

740
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:04,989
and check for leaks. So go to your lab.

741
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:07,075
Now? Tonight?

742
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:09,911
I got someone waiting for me
back in my crib.

743
00:47:10,537 --> 00:47:12,413
I don't care what you have
waiting for you.

744
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:14,958
If you wanna keep banging chicks
way above your tax bracket

745
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,085
and gene pool, you're gonna do as I say.

746
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,336
Go.

747
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:28,763
Hold on.

748
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:33,768
-What?
-Hello, Thomas.

749
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:36,604
Moogie. Joe.

750
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:38,273
We need to talk.

751
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:40,692
About what?

752
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,486
Did you use one of these
on professor Grimes computer?

753
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:46,656
Fuck you!

754
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,658
Come on, Thomas, you gotta let us in.

755
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,286
-No, I don't.
-We work with ChemiTrope now.

756
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,870
Oh, like I give a shit.

757
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:55,999
Look, look. We just wanna make
a deal with you.

758
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:59,252
-A deal?
-Yeah. A deal.

759
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:02,005
-A really cool deal.
-Like what?

760
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:05,216
Like you working for ChemiTrope.

761
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:33,411
Excuse me, is Dean Jeffries in?

762
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:36,122
Yes, but he's in a meeting,
do you have an appointment?

763
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:45,089
Sir! Excuse me, young man!

764
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:46,591
Dean, do you have a moment?

765
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,593
I'm sorry Dean, he just ran in here.

766
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:50,303
That's okay, Nora,
I can take care of this.

767
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:52,096
You sure?

768
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,474
Absolutely. Hold my calls
for a little while.

769
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:59,020
Thanks, Dean,
I really appreciate you seeing me, I...

770
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:00,647
I know it seems kind of weird.

771
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,024
Yeah, it is kind of weird.

772
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:06,110
But it seems urgent, so, what's up?

773
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:07,654
Well,

774
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:13,201
I think professor Grimes has been
conducting experiments

775
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,912
on unsuspecting subjects

776
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:17,872
like students.

777
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:22,335
Alan,

778
00:49:23,378 --> 00:49:24,671
I'm concerned about you.

779
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:27,715
Concerned about me?

780
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:32,053
I've been receiving reports all morning
about your behavior.

781
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:34,472
My behavior?

782
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:35,765
From who?

783
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:38,601
Well, Professor Grimes.

784
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:43,189
He, he just filed a complaint
that you broke into his computer,

785
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:48,069
which is not only a violation
of, of university policy,

786
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:49,904
but also the law as well.

787
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,031
No, no, no. Okay?

788
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:53,950
No, he's just upset
that I found him out, okay?

789
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,451
I’ve discovered what he's been up to.

790
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:58,329
I’ve just received a phone call
from Thomas Floyd.

791
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,373
A friend, right?

792
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,333
Thomas, yeah. He's a friend.

793
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:06,462
Well, Mr. Floyd informed me
that you came to him,

794
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:10,758
and, in retaliation for the professor
having an affair with your ex-girlfriend,

795
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:12,677
you asked him to help you

796
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:18,933
fabricate and plant information
about fictitious experiments

797
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,060
on professor Grimes' computer.

798
00:50:21,144 --> 00:50:22,645
What? That's bullshit, okay?

799
00:50:22,729 --> 00:50:25,022
Thomas would never lie about me,
all right?

800
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:27,275
A faculty member fraternizing
with a student

801
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:28,985
is against university policy.

802
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:32,238
And Professor Grimes
will be dealt with on this matter.

803
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:35,783
But your actions are more severe.

804
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:44,876
So I am deciding what's
in the best interest of the university,

805
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:46,836
and your best interest.

806
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:51,758
Perhaps that's treatment.

807
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,637
Treatment? Are you kidding me?

808
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,556
Alan, wait, don't leave.

809
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:08,274
-He left campus?
-No. He's gotta be around here somewhere.

810
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:09,692
Ladies.

811
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,113
-Let's go check out the science building.
-All right. I'll call it in.

812
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:16,157
-Cool.
-Did that girl have a Jamaican accent?

813
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,326
She definitely had a Jamaican booty.
It's fine.

814
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,249
Excuse me.

815
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:26,834
Yeah?

816
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:28,336
What's with all the cops?

817
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:31,047
The campus is in lockdown.

818
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:34,717
something about some psycho guy with a gun
stalking his ex-girlfriend.

819
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,845
Well, that doesn't sound too good.

820
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,150
You crazy bitch! What's wrong with you?

821
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:57,782
You skanky ass hoe.
If I ever see you with my man again,

822
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,951
I will fucking cut you!

823
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:02,078
I'm gonna kick your ass!

824
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:04,580
Erika! Erika!

825
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:07,375
What's the matter with you?

826
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:08,960
What's up?

827
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:12,672
Bitches.

828
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,257
Erika!

829
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:15,800
You crazy bitch.

830
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,947
Damn it, Alan.
You scared the shit out of me.

831
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,951
I'm sorry, man, just things have gotten
a little weird out there for me.

832
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:43,578
Oh, really?

833
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:47,665
Yeah. I'll tell you all about it,
I got, I got to use the bathroom, bro.

834
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:50,376
It's occupied.

835
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:57,925
What'd you want, anyway?

836
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,264
I don't know. I just,
I need a place to chill, you know.

837
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:04,974
Seems like everybody's turned on me.

838
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:08,185
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

839
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:11,272
And Dean Jeffries said that I made you
plant evidence in Grimes' computer.

840
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:17,904
Alan, you need to leave.

841
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,619
Thomas, did you rat me out or something?

842
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,537
I, I mean it. You got to go.

843
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,081
You did.

844
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:31,751
Just get out.

845
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:35,755
Why, Thomas? Well, did they threaten you?
I mean, just tell me.

846
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,590
Alan, leave or I'm calling security.

847
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:39,383
You okay, Thomas?

848
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,142
Say the word, I'll kick his ass.

849
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,103
No, Tony, it's okay.

850
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:53,481
He's leaving.

851
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:56,817
My god.

852
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:58,903
This is your price, Thomas?

853
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:02,531
This is what it takes for you
to sell your best friend out?

854
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:09,038
Man, how many times growing up
did I save your ass from getting kicked?

855
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:10,331
Got to warn you, pal.

856
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,918
You should leave while you can,
'cause if not you're going to regret it.

857
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,379
I got to warn you.

858
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:18,422
Once whatever Thomas gave you wears off,

859
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:20,508
you're going to regret
a shitload of stuff, pal.

860
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:29,016
I always had your back, man.

861
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:32,979
I'm sorry.

862
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:41,779
You're missing one hell
of a party in there, man.

863
00:54:50,663 --> 00:54:52,248
We're in the dormitory now.

864
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:56,252
Excuse me. Did you see a white male
come running through here?

865
00:54:57,253 --> 00:54:59,171
About your height, five-ten.

866
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:02,341
Wearing a brown t-shirt and jeans? No?

867
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:19,442
Sorry about that, Roger.

868
00:55:22,862 --> 00:55:24,030
How'd you know my name?

869
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:26,949
What did that asshole Thomas say about me?

870
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:28,034
Not much, really.

871
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:31,454
Don't bullshit me, Alan.

872
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:32,955
What did he say?

873
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:35,583
How do you know my name?

874
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:41,172
Your face is all over the campus website.

875
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:50,139
"Armed and dangerous"?
Where did they get that?

876
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:53,392
Yeah, don't worry.

877
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:56,020
You know, they said the same thing
about me in my last school.

878
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:58,647
That's why I had to change my identity
to come to this university.

879
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:03,110
You're a computer major, right?

880
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:06,113
Yeah, well, I was.

881
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,283
Until those jealous assholes kicked me out

882
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,951
because I had more computer skills

883
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:13,621
in my shit than they had
in their whole fucking depart...

884
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:16,290
Wait a minute, you didn't tell me
what that fucker said. Answer me.

885
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,960
Well, if I did tell you what he said,

886
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:22,713
you'd kick my ass just on principal.
So, nah.

887
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:24,757
Yeah, I probably would.

888
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,095
So what'd he say?

889
00:56:31,347 --> 00:56:33,849
Well, to put it bluntly,

890
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,269
he said you were a neurotic bitch.
And you're...

891
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:39,563
You're horrible in bed.

892
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,113
Horrible in bed?

893
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:57,123
How would he know,
he was passed out most the time.

894
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:00,292
Hey, man, I'm just telling
you what he said.

895
00:57:00,376 --> 00:57:01,877
-That's all.
-I'll kill that motherfucker.

896
00:57:07,383 --> 00:57:09,218
You know, he kinda screwed me over too.

897
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:12,513
Really?

898
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:16,892
Did you sleep with him?

899
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:18,769
No.

900
00:57:20,146 --> 00:57:21,480
No, man.

901
00:57:21,564 --> 00:57:23,357
It's, it's a personal thing.

902
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,027
But I think there's a way we both

903
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:28,904
can get some revenge.

904
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:32,908
Revenge is good.

905
00:57:34,994 --> 00:57:36,245
I'm so in.

906
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,334
What's on this?

907
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:47,631
It contains incriminating information
about Thomas' work with professor Grimes.

908
00:57:47,715 --> 00:57:50,509
I can't decipher it. It's all encoded.
It's impossible to break.

909
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:54,221
There ain’t nothing that Thomas can do
that I can't undo.

910
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,601
There it is.

911
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,895
How's that for neurotic?

912
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:02,521
Bitch.

913
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:11,405
Can you search by name?

914
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:12,907
Yeah. Whatever you want.

915
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:14,909
Sam.

916
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:17,453
Samantha Ellis.

917
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:26,253
Well, that's weird.

918
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,798
There's no documents
or video clips? Nothing?

919
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:32,718
No. Let me see.

920
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:36,639
No. I don't think so.
Not that I can see. Nothing.

921
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:40,017
Okay.

922
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:43,437
Search...

923
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:47,858

926
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:01,914
What?

927
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:04,208
"The detrimental side effects
includes depression

928
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:06,502
and paranoia leading to...

929
00:59:09,338 --> 00:59:10,589
suicidal behavior."

930
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:20,140
Okay. Search female student
romantic relationship.

931
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,533
Oh, twisted.

932
00:59:39,702 --> 00:59:41,996
Wait a minute, Thomas took these?

933
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,123
He is so not into vaginas.

934
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:46,333
These aren't his,
they belong to professor Grimes.

935
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:50,254
Oh, yeah. That guy is a total perv.

936
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:52,339
I mean all professors are but...

937
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:53,757
Right. Search female student

938
00:59:54,967 --> 00:59:56,385
romantic relationship

939
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:01,974
suicidal behavior.

940
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:10,065
There we go.

941
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,866
"Regina Haggerty.

942
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:21,952
Freshman, aged 19.

943
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:25,789
Committed suicide.

944
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:29,793
Self-inflicted gunshot wound to the skull.

945
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:33,005
October 18th.

946
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:37,718
Just last year."

947
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:43,390
Okay...

948
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,273
What the hell is going on?

949
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:54,860
Grimes developed this drug

950
01:00:55,444 --> 01:00:56,487
that controls

951
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,365
who people fall in love with.

952
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,535
And I'm convinced
he gave it to my girlfriend.

953
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:07,331
Ex-girlfriend.

954
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:09,500
A love potion?

955
01:01:10,918 --> 01:01:13,295
I'm wasting my time over a love potion?

956
01:01:13,379 --> 01:01:14,546
No.

957
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:17,091
Your girlfriend found someone
she likes to fuck more than you,

958
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,509
-and you're jealous.
-Don't.

959
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:19,676
Don't go there.

960
01:01:21,637 --> 01:01:24,390
I'm not jealous. This isn't about revenge
or anything like that.

961
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,644
I'm just worried about the danger
she might be in with these,

962
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:31,688
these side effects.

963
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:34,191
Sorry.

964
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,153
What are you gonna do?

965
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:41,532
What can I do?

966
01:01:42,408 --> 01:01:44,410
I can't go anywhere.
I, I can't go warn her.

967
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:46,036
The cops are outside looking for me.

968
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:57,631
Okay. I think I know somebody
who can help us.

969
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:02,177
And I think I got a way
to get across campus undetected.

970
01:02:02,511 --> 01:02:03,637
You're not gonna like it.

971
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:07,057
And what plan is that?

972
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:17,776
You know, you are kind of creepy, right?

973
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:21,405
Yeah.

974
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:30,164
-Come on.
-No.

975
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:31,915
-Come on.
-No, man.

976
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:33,750
-God damn it. Get out.
-This is never gonna work,

977
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:35,210
looking like a cracked out tranny.

978
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:38,630
Stop it. You look great.

979
01:02:39,173 --> 01:02:40,174
There.

980
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,842
Are you sure
your friends can help me, man?

981
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:44,553
Honestly, I have no idea.
But do you have better options?

982
01:02:45,846 --> 01:02:47,556
-No?
-No.

983
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:48,724
Then let's go.

984
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:55,689
This is so cool.

985
01:02:56,523 --> 01:03:00,319
Grimes has taken our barely functional
pheromone receptor system

986
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:01,820
and supercharged it

987
01:03:01,904 --> 01:03:03,864
by replacing a missing piece here,

988
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,491
and amping up something there.

989
01:03:05,574 --> 01:03:08,243
And he didn't just create any old
pheromone receptor.

990
01:03:08,327 --> 01:03:11,121
No, this one is designed to react only
to a specific pheromone.

991
01:03:11,205 --> 01:03:13,707
A specific pheromone worn only
by professor Grimes.

992
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:17,127
-We're going to get so many girls.
-We're going to get so many girls.

993
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:18,212
-Yes.
-Yes.

994
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:19,796
I don't care how many girls you guys get.

995
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,925
What's important is helping my friend Sam.
Are you serious about these morons?

996
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:25,052
-Morons? What the?
-Morons? What the?

997
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:29,515
Gentlemen, would you care
to educate this fool?

998
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:32,392
Show him what we got.

999
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:33,519
Read and weep, chump.

1000
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,896
We're the youngest
and smartest of our class.

1001
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:37,231
And already turned down offers

1002
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,399
from the world's largest
pharmaceutical companies.

1003
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:41,693
So, you got anyone more qualified
to help you with this,

1004
01:03:41,777 --> 01:03:43,278
go ahead and wait for their time.

1005
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,698
Okay, okay. Look, I'm sorry.

1006
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:48,742
I just need you to help her, that's all.

1007
01:03:50,661 --> 01:03:52,955
Well, what you want us
to do is not that simple.

1008
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:56,917
You see, Grimes is causing her brain
to release dopamine into her system.

1009
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:59,294
And that's a fatal flaw in his research.

1010
01:03:59,378 --> 01:04:02,130
He unable to control
the artificial flood of dopamine.

1011
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:04,800
So, like what happened to the other girl,

1012
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:07,302
the dopamine was slowly increasing
into her brain,

1013
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:08,720
more than the brain can handle.

1014
01:04:08,804 --> 01:04:12,683
So the brain begins to overheat,
and overload itself with crazy thoughts,

1015
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:14,268
and agitated paranoia sets in.

1016
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,644
Agitated paranoia.

1017
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:16,728
Cool term.

1018
01:04:16,812 --> 01:04:19,940
Agitated paranoia sets in,
and she'll go postal.

1019
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,900
The only relief from her madness...

1020
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:27,239
So what do we have to do?

1021
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:30,784
Well, you guys don't have to do squat.

1022
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:35,831
What we have to do
is really not that simple.

1023
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:40,127
We have to plug that dopamine pipeline
into her brain,

1024
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,670
but we got to do it safely.

1025
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:43,755
What do you mean safely?

1026
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:45,716
Safely.

1027
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:49,761
I mean we're dealing with her brain stem
which controls vital functions.

1028
01:04:50,429 --> 01:04:52,556
-Like breathing.
-Hello?

1029
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:54,641
-One mistake.
-One oops.

1030
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:56,810
And you're girlfriend's
an instant organ donor.

1031
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:58,437
"Oops"?

1032
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:00,939
What do they mean by "oops"?

1033
01:05:01,023 --> 01:05:04,318
Alan, don't worry. These guys
are the best chemists at the university.

1034
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:06,778
-In the world.
-In the universe.

1035
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:14,661
Hey, Sam.

1036
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:17,247
Alan, why are you dressed like that?

1037
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:19,583
Oh, this?

1038
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:22,336
It's a disguise. I don't know
if you've heard or not, but...

1039
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:24,588
I'm the new America's Most Wanted.

1040
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:25,964
Did you break into my apartment?

1041
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:28,675
Well, not technically, I...

1042
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:30,552
I used the keys that you gave me.

1043
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:31,720
Get out.

1044
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:32,804
Sam, listen to me.

1045
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:34,139
Not only am I gonna call the cops,

1046
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:35,974
but I'm gonna pay them
to beat the shit out of you.

1047
01:05:37,351 --> 01:05:40,312
Look. Look at these, Sam.
Grimes has experimented on other girls.

1048
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:41,396
Look, look, look.

1049
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:44,107
Here, from his last teaching job, here.

1050
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,860
Regina, a student like you,

1051
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,737
who was involved with him, like you.

1052
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,238
Who eventually committed suicide.

1053
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:51,698
I'm worried about you.

1054
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:55,202
Yeah. Billy already told me about her,
she was unstable.

1055
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:57,245
Yeah, she was unstable
because of his experiments.

1056
01:05:57,329 --> 01:05:59,539
Look here's the proof.
These are his research papers, look.

1057
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,542
He infected her without her knowledge,

1058
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:04,586
which led to her depression
and eventual suicide.

1059
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:07,130
-Those probably aren't even his documents.
-What?

1060
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,884
Billy's been worried
that one of his interns,

1061
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,136
Miller, was using his computer
to store information.

1062
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,013
Those are probably his.

1063
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:18,517
Sam, listen to you.

1064
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:21,520
It's like Grimes is this mad
cult scientist leader

1065
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,230
-and you're, you're one of his...
-Hey!

1066
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:26,066
I told you to never lay a hand on me.

1067
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:27,526
Hey, genius.

1068
01:06:28,068 --> 01:06:29,111
Who are you?

1069
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:31,154
You wanna go ahead and use the chloroform,

1070
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:33,532
or do I have to watch the lady
kick your ass all night?

1071
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:38,370
Thank you.

1072
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,459
Enough.

1073
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:47,754
You use too much of that shit,

1074
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:50,674
it'll get into her liver
where it'll metabolize into a phosgene.

1075
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:53,301
You know, they used that shit
as a chemical weapon in world war one.

1076
01:06:57,723 --> 01:06:58,932
I know things.

1077
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:10,736
You son of a bitch.
Don't you ever cheat on me!

1078
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:12,821
I will fucking kill you!

1079
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:15,365
What's her problem?

1080
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:16,950
Hold it right there.

1081
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:20,662
What the hell is going on here?

1082
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:25,083
Well, we just came from a costume party
and our friend here

1083
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:27,335
just had too much to drink,
so we're just taking her home.

1084
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:29,629
Are you sure you're not taking her
somewhere to assault her?

1085
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,339
Oh, please.

1086
01:07:32,758 --> 01:07:34,176
You really think she's our type?

1087
01:07:41,016 --> 01:07:42,058
Yeah, well...

1088
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:44,936
just make sure
you get her home safely, okay?

1089
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:47,856
And next time,
tell her to watch her alcohol intake.

1090
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:49,483
Will do, officer.

1091
01:07:50,025 --> 01:07:51,067
Oh, and...

1092
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:52,903
Nice legs, man.

1093
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:55,405
Thanks.

1094
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,366
Oh, yeah. Okay.

1095
01:08:00,327 --> 01:08:02,412
You ever kiss me again,
I'll rip your fucking heart out.

1096
01:08:02,913 --> 01:08:05,248
Don't worry.
Your pheromones taste like shit.

1097
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:11,588
All we had to do is take
Grimes’ special pheromone

1098
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:14,674
and link it to ricin toxin then,
bada-bing-bada-boom.

1099
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:17,469
Easier than mixing a Long Island Iced Tea.

1100
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:19,095
Yeah, but have you ever done that before?

1101
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:22,933
Yeah, just Saturday night,
the ladies love my Long Island.

1102
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:25,894
No, I'm talking about that bottle of toxin
you are about to shove up her nose.

1103
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:27,479
-Are you qualified?
-Alan.

1104
01:08:28,522 --> 01:08:31,233
We just drugged
and kidnapped your ex-girlfriend.

1105
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:35,237
If we stop now, we're going to jail,

1106
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,405
she's eventually
gonna blow her brains out.

1107
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:40,116
Okay? Now if we let them try this,

1108
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,328
we might not go to jail
and she might not blow her brains out.

1109
01:08:43,954 --> 01:08:45,497
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

1110
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:48,917
Yeah.

1111
01:09:17,863 --> 01:09:19,030
How long will it take?

1112
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:20,615
Not sure.

1113
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,410
And how do we know if it works?

1114
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,873
I mean, how do we know
she's no longer under his spell?

1115
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:31,751
The only way to find out
if someone is still attracted to someone

1116
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:35,130
is to put both of them together
and see what happens.

1117
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:02,532
Hey, professor.

1118
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:04,743
I didn't think you were gonna come, man.

1119
01:10:05,744 --> 01:10:06,786
Why wouldn't I?

1120
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:09,331
I didn't figure
you'd have the courage to answer

1121
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:11,291
for your diabolical experiments, man.

1122
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,085
"Diabolical experiments".

1123
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:16,212
Make me sound like I'm some

1124
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:20,508
crazy scientist
from some cheesy sci-fi movie.

1125
01:10:20,926 --> 01:10:22,135
But isn't that what you are?

1126
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:25,889
Where's Sam?

1127
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:28,767
Over there, in the basement.

1128
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:36,441
You brought the police?

1129
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,610
Smart move, Grimes.

1130
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:41,071
You really want the world
learning of your experiments, man?

1131
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,031
What makes you think they're the police?

1132
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:50,872
Take care of this.

1133
01:11:15,814 --> 01:11:16,856
You okay, Alan?

1134
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:19,901
Yeah, I think so.

1135
01:11:22,237 --> 01:11:23,738
Too bad.

1136
01:11:40,255 --> 01:11:41,339
Hey.

1137
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:47,137
What's going on, man?

1138
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:49,889
"What's going on, man?"

1139
01:11:50,682 --> 01:11:52,600
We're in a fucking cage,
that's what's going on, man.

1140
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:55,228
We never signed up for this
when we agreed to help you.

1141
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:56,354
Hold on.

1142
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:59,149
You inject an experimental drug
into a unconscious girl

1143
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:01,985
without her previous consent,
you act like you did nothing wrong?

1144
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:04,112
No, we do tons of stuff wrong.

1145
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:05,864
But we are smart enough
to never get caught.

1146
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:08,908
Okay, guys, what are we gonna do?
Can we please focus on that?

1147
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:12,162
Do you have any bright ideas?

1148
01:12:14,289 --> 01:12:15,749
I don't know. Where are we?

1149
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:19,210
We're in a cage, dumbass.

1150
01:12:19,294 --> 01:12:21,629
I know that. But where is this cage?
Are we still in campus?

1151
01:12:21,713 --> 01:12:23,798
Well, we'd tell you,
but they put a hood over our heads

1152
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:25,341
when they grabbed us.

1153
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:28,053
Where's Sam?

1154
01:12:35,226 --> 01:12:38,063
I'm sorry, man.
Those guys had guns, okay? They had...

1155
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:46,988
Wait a minute, those guys had guns.

1156
01:12:47,072 --> 01:12:48,907
Yeah? So?

1157
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:52,827
So, if we can overpower...

1158
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:58,083
If we can overpower one of the guards

1159
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,751
and get their guns,

1160
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:02,337
we could shoot our way out of here.

1161
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,714
Have you lost your fucking mind, man?

1162
01:13:04,798 --> 01:13:06,257
-We're all gonna...
-I'm down with that.

1163
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:09,344
Hell, yeah. Let's show them who's bitch.

1164
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:16,768
What's wrong?

1165
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:20,146
Hello, somebody, we need your help.
Please, my friend is really sick.

1166
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:22,232
Please, somebody, come on, please.

1167
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:25,235
Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.

1168
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:27,445
I'm sorry. My friend, he's right there,
he's just really...

1169
01:13:28,196 --> 01:13:30,615
If you think I'm stupid enough
to fall for that shit,

1170
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:33,159
I'll blow your fucking skull apart
just for insulting me.

1171
01:13:35,787 --> 01:13:36,830
Okay.

1172
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:43,461
Hey, Alan.

1173
01:13:47,841 --> 01:13:49,175
Where's Sam?

1174
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:52,262
Trust me, I'm working on that.

1175
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:55,932
Roger.

1176
01:13:56,349 --> 01:14:00,228
Did you decipher Grimes' cryptic files
in what, a second?

1177
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:03,398
I don't know what you are talking about.

1178
01:14:04,315 --> 01:14:07,318
We went through your room
and found all your deciphering equipment.

1179
01:14:10,405 --> 01:14:11,739
Pretty impressive.

1180
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:17,036
Derek, Darin,
you two have been keeping busy.

1181
01:14:18,246 --> 01:14:23,001
There isn't one research project
the two have ever been involved in

1182
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:25,461
that would be considered
even remotely legal.

1183
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:27,297
Sir, you are mistaken.

1184
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:29,257
You must be confusing us
with someone else.

1185
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:31,885
Impressive work, gentlemen.

1186
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:33,178
Thomas.

1187
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,596
Where's Sam?

1188
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,015
Let's go get her.

1189
01:15:04,918 --> 01:15:07,462
I'm sorry, what the hell
are they doing here?

1190
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:10,673
ChemiTrope requested it.

1191
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:13,801
Since when did you get so tight
with ChemiTrope.

1192
01:15:13,885 --> 01:15:17,096
Well, since I convinced them
they could run their research department

1193
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:19,265
a lot more efficiently
than their currently doing.

1194
01:15:19,766 --> 01:15:21,643
So, what are you implying?

1195
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:25,063
I'm implying I found out
how much you've gone over budget

1196
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:27,232
on this Cupid's Arrow Project.

1197
01:15:27,315 --> 01:15:30,026
And how it might have caused
a girl's suicide

1198
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:32,403
and possibly an ugly publicity nightmare
for the company.

1199
01:15:32,487 --> 01:15:33,696
So what?

1200
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:36,324
The company's made a killing
on spinning bad press.

1201
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:38,660
Well, probably so.

1202
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:41,788
But they're also concerned
about the profitability

1203
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,873
of what research they are covering up.

1204
01:15:43,957 --> 01:15:46,209
And yours is looking like
a bad investment.

1205
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:48,378
Now, whoa, whoa. My...

1206
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:50,755
My work and research is coming along fine.

1207
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:52,548
In fact, it's progressing
right on schedule.

1208
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:54,217
Is it?

1209
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,511
You sure your research hasn't hit a wall?
I mean...

1210
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:59,430
it has according to my friends.
Isn't that right, gentlemen?

1211
01:15:59,514 --> 01:16:00,974
-Oh, yeah.
-Absolutely.

1212
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:02,767
In fact, professor,

1213
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:04,852
it's the twins who came up
with the missing element

1214
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:06,604
that corrected the flaws in your research.

1215
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:09,190
They developed a way
to control the side effects,

1216
01:16:09,274 --> 01:16:11,317
as well as a way
to turn off Cupid's Arrow.

1217
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:14,320
-We figured it out in seconds.
-Even faster than that.

1218
01:16:14,988 --> 01:16:18,241
Exactly, and if they did overcome
the problems in your research,

1219
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:20,618
then ChemiTrope would be interested
in meeting them.

1220
01:16:20,702 --> 01:16:22,120
You know, that's ridiculous. Okay?

1221
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:25,290
There's no proof they understood
or even comprehended my research,

1222
01:16:25,373 --> 01:16:26,541
let alone manipulates it.

1223
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:27,959
All right.

1224
01:16:28,376 --> 01:16:30,211
You want the proof?
I'll show you the proof.

1225
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:33,131
We'll just ask her.

1226
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:35,466
We'll ask her how she feels.

1227
01:16:37,552 --> 01:16:38,594
Really?

1228
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:47,812
Sam.

1229
01:16:49,397 --> 01:16:50,481
Sam, wake up.

1230
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:53,192
Sam.

1231
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:03,536
How do you feel?

1232
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:07,582
My head hurts.

1233
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,835
Your cologne isn't helping either.

1234
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:15,214
Sam.

1235
01:17:18,426 --> 01:17:19,552
Do you love me?

1236
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:23,931
Alan.

1237
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:27,852
I already told you I found somebody else.

1238
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:31,064
I know you found somebody else.

1239
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:33,149
But did you really find somebody
to replace me?

1240
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:37,111
Somebody that makes you feel
the way I make you feel?

1241
01:17:56,381 --> 01:17:57,590
Sorry, kid.

1242
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:02,845
Well.

1243
01:18:06,641 --> 01:18:07,642
Hey.

1244
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:10,061
Hey, hey, hey. That's disgusting, okay?

1245
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,687
Clearly she's still a little drugged up

1246
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:13,564
from whatever the hell
you injected her with.

1247
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:17,777
Sam, I'm sorry, okay.

1248
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,612
It's gonna be all right.

1249
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,114
I'll take care of you.

1250
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:43,386
Sorry, kissing you just sort of
makes me feel nauseous.

1251
01:18:54,939 --> 01:18:56,149
You know, professor,

1252
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:58,401
it's not nice to mess with mother nature.

1253
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:00,987
You know what, fuck mother nature.

1254
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:03,448
Okay? What does that bitch
know about love?

1255
01:19:04,157 --> 01:19:05,324
Jesus Christ.

1256
01:19:05,408 --> 01:19:08,369
For, for, since the beginning of time,
she's been bringing together couples

1257
01:19:08,453 --> 01:19:10,830
that have no business being together.

1258
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:15,501
Yeah. That's right.
People who just drive each other nuts.

1259
01:19:15,585 --> 01:19:17,879
You know, make each other's lives
fucking miserable.

1260
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:20,965
All I'm trying to do, for God's sakes,

1261
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:23,301
is bring a little order
to romance, people.

1262
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:25,678
Is that so wrong?

1263
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,724
A little rational thought to the people

1264
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:32,059
that we want to spend
the rest of our lives with.

1265
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:35,563
Rational thought in love?

1266
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,775
Sounds kind of boring to me, professor.

1267
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:42,403
Yeah.

1268
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:46,240
Boring to you, I'm sure it is.

1269
01:19:46,324 --> 01:19:47,575
Jesus Christ.

1270
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:50,953
-Hey, Miller.
-Oh, shit.

1271
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:53,706
Erika?

1272
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:58,377
Goddamn it. Where'd you get the gun?

1273
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:02,381
I've been looking for you.

1274
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:04,675
You fucking idiot. I told you, man.

1275
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:05,927
Lay off her medication.

1276
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:07,762
Double the dose does not mean
double the fun.

1277
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:09,096
You're right, professor.

1278
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:11,891
Double the dose just accelerates
the psychotic process, you dumb shit.

1279
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:13,768
What the fuck does it matter?

1280
01:20:15,186 --> 01:20:17,897
Since when does a bat shit,
crazy hoe like her

1281
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,357
know how to use a gun?

1282
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,283
-You failed me.
-What?

1283
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:32,828
No, no. I didn't fail you.

1284
01:20:32,912 --> 01:20:36,832
No, Erika, Erika.
I've been here for your the whole time.

1285
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:40,378
No. In your class, you...

1286
01:20:41,212 --> 01:20:43,130
You failed me on the midterm.

1287
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:47,385
That, well.

1288
01:20:48,678 --> 01:20:51,973
You know, frankly, you failed
to articulate your arguments and...

1289
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:53,224
Oh, yeah?

1290
01:20:53,307 --> 01:20:56,394
And how well did I articulate that...

1291
01:20:57,979 --> 01:20:59,730
blow job I gave you?

1292
01:21:08,948 --> 01:21:11,325
Well, if you remember right,
I did give you an A for that.

1293
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:20,251
Wait.

1294
01:21:20,668 --> 01:21:22,336
Erika, you don't have to do this.

1295
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:24,922
Why not?

1296
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:33,889
'Cause you have a lot to live for.

1297
01:21:35,141 --> 01:21:36,309
Didn't...

1298
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,936
you just see me kill the only guy

1299
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:41,272
ever really loved, like...

1300
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:43,733
Like Romeo and Juliet?

1301
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:45,526
Well, actually, I'm...

1302
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:48,029
Juliet didn't actually kill Romeo in,

1303
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:49,405
in that story.

1304
01:21:50,281 --> 01:21:51,782
No, Erika.

1305
01:21:52,575 --> 01:21:53,951
It wasn't love.

1306
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:57,830
It was medically induced psychosis.

1307
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,334
You're just making it worse, okay?

1308
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,127
Well, you're wrong.

1309
01:22:04,045 --> 01:22:05,963
It's always best to tell the truth.

1310
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:14,722
So you're telling me

1311
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:22,229
I murdered someone over, over nothing?

1312
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:23,773
It wasn't nothing.

1313
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:27,360
It wasn't, it wasn't your fault.

1314
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:31,405
The love, the emotions,

1315
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:35,493
it was all a scientific experiment.

1316
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:38,245
No. No.

1317
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:40,998
It wasn't no experiment.

1318
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:45,544
I really, I really loved him.

1319
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:50,007
You know what, Erika?

1320
01:22:51,509 --> 01:22:52,677
What?

1321
01:22:53,928 --> 01:22:56,097
Juliet didn't kill Romeo.

1322
01:22:58,349 --> 01:23:00,935
But she loved him so much that when,

1323
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:02,353
when he died,

1324
01:23:03,813 --> 01:23:05,940
she realized she couldn't
live without him.

1325
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:09,276
Remember?

1326
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:13,447
Yeah.

1327
01:23:14,407 --> 01:23:15,825
I remember.

1328
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,828
Wasn't that a beautiful ending?

1329
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:25,918
Yes.

1330
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:28,504
It was beautiful.

1331
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:30,172
No!

1332
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:38,347
Well, I don't know.

1333
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:42,810
It was like this
overwhelming craving for him.

1334
01:23:44,395 --> 01:23:46,439
Really gotta tell you,
it kinda hurt me a little bit.

1335
01:23:48,065 --> 01:23:50,860
I mean, all it took was a drug
for you to fall in love with someone else.

1336
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:53,863
You could look at it like that.

1337
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:56,782
Or you could look at it like

1338
01:23:56,866 --> 01:23:59,702
I would have to start taking drugs
to fall in love with someone else.

1339
01:24:00,578 --> 01:24:01,662
Hey, Alan.

1340
01:24:04,165 --> 01:24:05,875
Can I bother you for a second?

1341
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:11,797
Be right back.

1342
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:20,097
How's your secret
ChemiTrope society doing?

1343
01:24:20,973 --> 01:24:23,058
You make it sound like a bad thing.

1344
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:25,227
Yeah. But how'd you get away with it?

1345
01:24:25,311 --> 01:24:27,396
Man, how'd you keep
all the witnesses quiet?

1346
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:30,316
It was easy. We hired them.

1347
01:24:36,822 --> 01:24:39,116
And what about Roger? He hates your guts.

1348
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:51,170
Well, that makes sense.

1349
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:54,131
Alan, I'm...

1350
01:24:56,634 --> 01:24:57,968
I'm sorry I sold you out.

1351
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:02,598
I guess I had a...

1352
01:25:03,224 --> 01:25:05,184
momentary lapse of priorities.

1353
01:25:07,978 --> 01:25:11,690
Believe me, I never forgotten
that you've always had my back.

1354
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:15,110
You have to know
that I'll always have yours.

1355
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:18,739
Okay?

1356
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:33,921
What was that all about?

1357
01:25:34,839 --> 01:25:38,092
It's nothing. Just two friends talking.

1358
01:25:40,928 --> 01:25:43,722
With everything's that's going on,
I've been meaning to ask you something.

1359
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:48,936
Why exactly did you fall in love
with me in the first place?

1360
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:54,650
Alan, does it really matter why?

1361
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,320
Remember from class?

1362
01:25:58,404 --> 01:26:00,781
"Love is an irrational, primitive thing.

1363
01:26:02,575 --> 01:26:04,410
Don't try to figure it out.

1364
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:06,120
Just enjoy it."

1365
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:10,332
That's deep.

1366
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:12,918
That's love.
