1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,300
Sit back down
and shut your trap!

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,830
It's time for "Mail Call!"

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,200
Welcome to a special high-flying
edition of "Mail Call."

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,600
Man, you're going to love this!

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,100
It's all about aircraft, airmen,
and amazing airborne stuff

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,000
up the wazoo!

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,130
Now, a while back, you might
remember that I got an offer

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,470
to go sky dive with the
United States Army Parachute

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,870
Team, the Golden Knights.

10
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,800
So then I got a candy-ass
email from Ken in Wyoming,

11
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,870
Michigan, saying, Gunny, I'll
bet you're too chicken to jump.

12
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,600
Well, Ken, I hope you're
ready to put your money where

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,000
your mouth is!

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,930
Because this is one bet that
I'm willing to take right now.

15
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,730
[music playing]

16
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,470
R. LEE ERMEY
(VOICEOVER): You see,

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,770
when it comes to
precision parachuting,

18
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,030
no one does it better than the
United States Army's Golden

19
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,400
Knights.

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,030
These daredevils of the sky
push every jump to the limit.

21
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,470
They love what they do, and
they're definitely gonzo.

22
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,830
They perform at air
shows all over the world.

23
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,470
So it's no wonder that they're
America's reigning National

24
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,830
Sport Parachuting champions.

25
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,470
I caught up with
the Golden Knights

26
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,270
at Edwards Air Force
Base in California,

27
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,670
where they were getting
ready for an upcoming show.

28
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,470
But even a Golden Knight is
only as good as his armor.

29
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,030
So I wanted to get a
close look at their gear

30
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,730
before I took my leap.

31
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,170
I was all ears while Sergeant
First Class Billy Van Soelen

32
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,100
went over the game plan with me.

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,030
Today, we're going to be doing
what's called the tandem jump.

34
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,500
I'll be strapped
to him, and he'll

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,530
be strapped to the parachute.

36
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,170
He'll control the
one chute that'll

37
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,130
bring us both back to Earth.

38
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,900
So you're going to
hang all the way down.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,230
Your head will be back.

40
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,870
At that time, I'll say, Gunny,
are you ready to skydive?

41
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,200
Ready to rock and roll.

42
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,230
Well, you'll say no, but
I'll think you're saying, go.

43
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,630
And I'll say, OK,
ready, set, go.

44
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,830
And we're going to exit the
aircraft, just like that.

45
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,600
All right.

46
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,500
R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
For our tandem jump,

47
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,370
the Sergeant will be strapping
on a semi-elliptical ram-air

48
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,370
parachute.

49
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,500
It's highly maneuverable.

50
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,770
Set a steering line, you
can stop it on a dime.

51
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,500
But it's very big,
and it will allow

52
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,800
the maximum suspended weight
of 500 pounds-- both of us

53
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,200
together.

54
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,170
R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
But if for some reason

55
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,970
the main chute malfunctions, as
demonstrated in this air show,

56
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,030
we'll go to plan B.

57
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,730
All I did was reach down here
and grab this green handle.

58
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,800
You notice there's a series
of cables that come up

59
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,430
through these concentric
rings right here.

60
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,570
What will happen is as
I pull those cables,

61
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,070
this loop goes
through this grommet,

62
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,170
and these three rings
will simultaneously

63
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,730
fall off of one another and
jettison the main parachute

64
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,030
away.

65
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,970
R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
As the main chute detaches,

66
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,470
a safety mechanism automatically
releases a reserve chute.

67
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,700
This can also be done manually.

68
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,000
But if the release
handles crap out,

69
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,300
or if you're
knocked unconscious,

70
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,470
this pack is rigged with
another backup system,

71
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,670
a gizmo called the Airtec
CYPRES, or Cybernetic Parachute

72
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,070
Release System.

73
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,030
It reads barometric pressure and
speed to automatically deploy

74
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,830
the reserve chute.

75
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,270
Well, I'm ready to gear up
and head out to the tarmac.

76
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,700
You know what I think?

77
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,630
What's that, buddy?

78
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,300
I think we need to go do this.

79
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,100
What do you say?

80
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,430
Let's go make a skydive!

81
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,230
All right!

82
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,370
Woo!

83
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,230
Watch your step.

84
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,830
R. LEE ERMEY
(VOICEOVER): The aircraft

85
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,530
that we're boarding is a
twin-prop F27 Friendship

86
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,730
Fokker, the Golden
Knights flagship.

87
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,900
It's used as both the jump
platform and to travel the team

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,600
throughout the year.

89
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,530
As we got close to our jump
altitude of 12,000 feet,

90
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,100
the Sergeant and
I got reacquainted

91
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,130
and snapped together
into our tandem rig.

92
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,030
There's no turning back now.

93
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,370
You'll notice I wasn't alone.

94
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,330
My little buddy, Mini-Lee,
wanted in on the action.

95
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,830
He's an adrenaline
junkie too, you know,

96
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,630
and he's going to jump solo.

97
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,470
It's go-time, Mini-Lee.

98
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,930
3, 2, 1--

99
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,370
Geronimo!

100
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,400
The mini-chute you
see trailing us

101
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,570
is called the drone pilot chute.

102
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,670
It's used to slow our
descent during freefall,

103
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,630
since us heavier tandem
guys would fall faster

104
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,370
than the single jumpers.

105
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,100
That way, we don't get
ahead of the camera man.

106
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,730
Well, it looks like we
won't need the reserve chute

107
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,800
after all.

108
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,670
But that ground is
coming up pretty fast.

109
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,170
The sarge gives me a quick
review on our landing

110
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,070
procedures so we can
stick this like pros.

111
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,470
All right, Gunny, get those
feet and knees nice and high

112
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,770
for me.
- You got it!

113
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,570
There you go.

114
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,630
Good.

115
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,400
Just like that.

116
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,770
Just like that.

117
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,300
Now, remember, don't put them
down till I tell you to, OK?

118
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,230
OK.

119
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,300
You say drop them,
I got them down.

120
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,270
And here we go!

121
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,170
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

122
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,600
And set them!

123
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,070
Aah!

124
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,730
Yes!

125
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,570
Ah!

126
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,970
What did you think about that?

127
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,700
Oh, it's so quiet and
so beautiful up there.

128
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,070
That's a little
bit too serene.

129
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,930
I think it's--

130
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,200
I think I'm in big trouble.

131
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,470
That's what I think.

132
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,970
Because now I'm
going to have to buy

133
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,400
me one of these
damn things, and I'm

134
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,100
going to have to get involved.

135
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,900
Hey, Gunny--

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,170
That was--

137
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,300
--how was that for
being an army of one, huh?

138
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,870
That was a pretty
good army of one.

139
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,570
Yeah, baby.

140
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,630
That was the closest I've
been to a guy for a long time.

141
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,830
R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
Well, before we packed it

142
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,200
in for the day, the guys had
a special surprise for me

143
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,330
back at the air field.

144
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,500
By order of the United
States Army Parachute Team,

145
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,130
I hereby promote you to
honorary basic parachutist.

146
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,330
Congratulations there, Gunny.

147
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,770
Well, Semper Fi.

148
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,170
[applause]

149
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,570
[inaudible]

150
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,400
Absolutely.

151
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,770
You know it may have taken
me a while to get my wings,

152
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,070
but it sure as hell
was worth the wait.

153
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,600
And as long as we're talking
Army and airplanes here,

154
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,370
a lot of you have been
sending in emails giving me

155
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,630
serious flak, and I'm
sick and tired of it.

156
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,530
You're whining that when I'm
talking about World War II

157
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,800
flyboys, I call them
the Army Air Force

158
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,230
when I should be calling
them the Army Air Corps.

159
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,470
Well, my answer to you is
stuff it up your tailpipe.

160
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,500
Because both are correct.

161
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,830
[music playing]

162
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,270
R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER): The
Army's aerial combat history

163
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,900
goes back to 1917 when
it entered World War I

164
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,430
and formed the US
Army Air Service.

165
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,830
Their biggest hero
was a little old ace

166
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,170
named Eddie Rickenbacker.

167
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,870
In 1926, the Air Service became
a permanent part of the Army

168
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,400
and was renamed
the Army Air Corps.

169
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,630
In June 1941, the Army
streamlined things

170
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,300
and merged a bunch of outfits,
including the Air Corps,

171
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,430
into a new unit called
the US Army Air Forces.

172
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,330
It wasn't until 1947 that
President Truman signed

173
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,830
the National Security Act,
creating a new separate branch

174
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,670
of the military called the
United States Air Force.

175
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,330
And even though
the Air Force is now

176
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,600
our main aerial component
in the military,

177
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,030
the Army never got out of the
air war business altogether.

178
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,030
And that's why the
only primary jump

179
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,030
school in the entire
United States military

180
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,370
is still taught by the Army.

181
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,430
And that should just about
answer all of your jump

182
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,830
questions, except for one.

183
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,900
Whatever happened to my
little buddy Mini-Lee?

184
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,270
Well, I'm expecting him
along here any minute.

185
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,070
Bend your knees!

186
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,770
Bend your knees, Mini-Lee!

187
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,730
[splat]

188
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,170
Ah!

189
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,370
Oh, that's gotta hurt.

190
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,770
I got an email from Zach, who
lives in Ledyard, Connecticut.

191
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,430
He's asking about
the Curtiss P-40.

192
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,570
That's the first airplane
to take the fight directly

193
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,430
to the Japanese in WWII.

194
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,200
And, Zach, if we're
going to talk P-40s,

195
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,470
we gotta talk
Flying Tigers, baby.

196
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,400
[music playing]

197
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,630
R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
When World War II broke out,

198
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,100
we needed to really crank up
our aircraft production lines.

199
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,670
At the time, the best
fighter plane we had

200
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:01,170
was the P-40, built by the
Curtiss-Wright Corporation.

201
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,000
A sturdy, low-wing
monoplane, the P-40

202
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,400
was powered by a 1,200
horsepower Allison engine.

203
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,100
It packed three 50-caliber
machine guns in each wing

204
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,270
and could carry
a 500-pound bomb.

205
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,300
It could fly at speeds
over 350 miles an hour

206
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,570
and as high as 32,000 feet.

207
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,070
During the war, we
sold or gave the P-40

208
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,030
to a lot of our allies.

209
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,600
And this war bird saw
action all over the world.

210
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,570
Depending on which Air
Force was flying it,

211
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,670
the P-40 was nicknamed the
Tomahawk, the Kitty Hawk,

212
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:40,930
or the War Hawk.

213
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,600
Probably the most famous
outfit to use the P-40

214
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,970
was the American
Volunteer Group.

215
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,970
But you know them as
the Flying Tigers.

216
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,330
These were American
pilots who had volunteered

217
00:09:54,430 --> 00:10:00,200
to fight for China before the
US had even entered the war.

218
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,930
Early in 1941, Madam
Chiang Kai-Shek,

219
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:08,400
wife of the Chinese leader,
asked a retired US Army Air

220
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,030
Corps officer named
Claire Chennault

221
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,930
to help out and organize
a group of fighter pilots.

222
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,770
And since China was a key
American ally and already

223
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,600
at war with Japan,
President Roosevelt

224
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:30,430
signed an unpublished executive
order on April 15, 1941.

225
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,300
It authorized Reserve
Officers and enlisted men

226
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,330
to resign from the Army Air
Corps, Naval, and Marine Air

227
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,430
Services to form
the volunteer unit.

228
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,900
100 pilots and 200
ground crew members

229
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,400
arrived in the summer of
1941 to begin their training.

230
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
But there was one big problem.

231
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,370
Chennault didn't have enough
P-40s for his guys to fly.

232
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,130
Luckily, the airplane builders,
Curtiss-Wright, had a solution.

233
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,870
Since they were already
building P-40s for the British,

234
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,770
the folks at
Curtiss-Wright decided

235
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,330
that they'd give the
Brits updated P-40s

236
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,770
a little later so they could
get the Tigers the older P-40B's

237
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,570
right away.

238
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,130
By late December, just two
weeks after Pearl Harbor,

239
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,700
they were facing the Japanese
Air Force in combat operation.

240
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,400
Since this was the older P-40B
that the Tigers were flying,

241
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,030
it wasn't the best of the bunch.

242
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,700
They were not equipped with
a gun sight, bomb rack,

243
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,070
or extra fuel.

244
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,630
And the P-40 was not very
fast at high altitudes.

245
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,000
But the Flying Tiger
pilots made do.

246
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,830
Using the plane's low
altitude speed and stability,

247
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,930
Chennault trained
the Tiger Pilots

248
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,600
to exploit the
enemy's weaknesses

249
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,530
and make the best
of their equipment.

250
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,500
During their first
combat on December 20,

251
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,630
they shot down 9 out
of 10 Japanese bombers

252
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,430
they were targeting, while
only losing one P-40.

253
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,530
During another key mission
on Christmas day of 1941,

254
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,330
the Tigers knocked out 23
Japanese bombers and fighters

255
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,630
without losing one single P-40.

256
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,970
The Tigers also supplied
critical air cover

257
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,970
for forces moving
along the Burma

258
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:39,300
Road, the most vital supply line
for the allies through Asia.

259
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,800
When it was all over, the
total number of the Tigers

260
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,330
were impressive--

261
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:49,570
286 Japanese planes shot down
and only 12 Flying Tiger pilots

262
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:54,070
listed as killed or
missing in action.

263
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,870
Finally, the US Army Air Forces
absorbed the Flying Tigers

264
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,330
in 1942.

265
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,670
Most of the men of
the squadron stayed on

266
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,000
to fight in the Pacific,
and Claire Chennault

267
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,870
remained their leader.

268
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:12,730
He rejoined the army and earned
the rank of Major General.

269
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,470
By the end of the war, the
brave and skillful P-40 pilots

270
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,230
had shot down 650
Japanese planes.

271
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,470
Not bad for a team flying a
fighter that a lot of people

272
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,670
felt was second class.

273
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,570
Got an email about
an interesting bit

274
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,670
of Flying Tigers gear.

275
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,800
Dottie in St. Louis, MO, is
asking, what is a blood chit?

276
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,600
Well, Dottie, this
is a blood chit.

277
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,600
It's also known
as an escape flag.

278
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,670
R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
Starting in World War II,

279
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,930
pilots sewed these flags
into their jackets.

280
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,900
If a pilot was shot down
and too injured to talk,

281
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,200
or didn't know the
local language,

282
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,100
the blood chit
would speak for him.

283
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,270
It let whoever found him know
that if the pilot was given

284
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,930
food, shelter, medical
care, and returned safely

285
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,900
to American hands, there'd be
a reward in it for the rescuer.

286
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,300
That's why it was
called a chit, which

287
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,330
is basic slang for an IOU.

288
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,770
Blood chits are still being
issued to pilots and crews

289
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,300
operating in hostile territory.

290
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,430
But just how many
blood chits, if any,

291
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,500
have actually been turned in?

292
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,430
And what kind of reward
are we talking about here?

293
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,930
Well, that's
strictly classified.

294
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,070
Not too long ago, I got an email
from Lee in Fort Walton Beach,

295
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,530
Florida, asking me to check
out what he calls a real war

296
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,330
machine, the AC-130U gunship.

297
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,300
And once I found out that
this baby has the biggest

298
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,170
gun in the sky, it was an offer
that I just couldn't refuse.

299
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,730
R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER): We
hauled ass down to the Florida

300
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:05,600
panhandle to visit Hurlburt
Field, home of the Air Force's

301
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,300
16th Special Operations Wing
and the 4th Special Operations

302
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,430
Squadron.

303
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,800
The men and women of the 4th
SOS are known as ghost riders.

304
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,970
And the AC-130U gunship
they fly is dubbed "Spooky."

305
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,530
Spooky's job is
to help the grunts

306
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,700
on the ground with close
air support firepower

307
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,670
and armed reconnaissance.

308
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,870
With a 25-millimeter
Gatling gun,

309
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,870
40-millimeter rapid-fire cannon,
and a 105-millimeter Howitzer

310
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,300
mounted under the left wing,
Spooky circles the target

311
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,930
like a big dark cloud
hurling a hail storm of lead.

312
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,770
Spooky is a converted Lockheed
C-130 Hercules Assault

313
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,100
Transport.

314
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,530
The airframe hasn't changed
much since the first C-130s

315
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,570
of the 1950s.

316
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,170
But on the inside,
the AC-130U hauls

317
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:09,100
one of the most complex aircraft
weapons systems in the world.

318
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,170
JASON BUSS: We're able to
literally put her rounds

319
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,270
within meters, or
feet, of the target.

320
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,770
And we can engage
relatively safe distance

321
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,470
to the friendly forces and
without risk of endangering

322
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,530
them.

323
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,130
R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
But don't expect

324
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,600
Spooky to win any air races.

325
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,400
It's big and slow.

326
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,770
And that's just the
way they want it.

327
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,500
When a fighter
might come in and be

328
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,500
able to make a quick pass
and look at something,

329
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,870
we can literally stay
on station for hours.

330
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,800
R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
But since it is slow,

331
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,970
the AC-130U might make an
easy target in the daytime.

332
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,600
That's why it flies nearly
all its missions after dark.

333
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,370
JASON BUSS: No lights on at all,
not in the cockpit or anything.

334
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,130
We fly on night vision goggles.

335
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,500
So we do our job, basically,
off very small chem lights,

336
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,100
just knowing where the guns are.

337
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,500
It can be very hectic.

338
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,230
But we were very well trained in
what we do, and we do it a lot.

339
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,370
R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
And what they do the most

340
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,070
is kick butt with
their 3-gun system.

341
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,030
This is our number
one gun position.

342
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,300
Basically, this is our
25-millimeter Gatling gun.

343
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Fires 1,800 shots per minute,
plus it lasts 100 rounds.

344
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,870
This is a good
psychological weapon

345
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,870
because it has a mass
amount of rounds going out

346
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,930
at a high rate of fire,
basically saturating the area

347
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,300
where the enemy's at.

348
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,300
R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER): On
the early gun ships dating back

349
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,300
to the Vietnam War,
the guns were fixed

350
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,730
to the side of the plane,
and the pilot aimed them

351
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,000
by maneuvering the
entire aircraft.

352
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,330
Today, Spooky's guns are
on hydraulic mounts, guided

353
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:42,230
by some sophisticated
sensors and sights.

354
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,630
This is our number two gun.

355
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,600
It's a 40-millimeter
Bofors cannon.

356
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,100
This gives us a little bit more
capability on larger targets.

357
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,930
Each round weighs
about five pounds.

358
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,570
Rapid fire-- this is
going to be firing

359
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,970
about 100 shots per minute.

360
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,230
R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
Not enough firepower for you?

361
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,100
Then check this out.

362
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,070
These flyboys have a
frigging cannon on board!

363
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,730
This is our number
three gun position.

364
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,130
It's 105-millimeter Howitzer.

365
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,200
Basically, it's the same
gun that the army uses.

366
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,430
We've just adapted it
towards the aircraft.

367
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,700
We're requiring a longer recoil.

368
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:17,300
We can sustain a rate of fire
around 10 rounds a minute.

369
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,730
R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
In action, an AC-130

370
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,000
can be a pretty chaotic place,
with guns firing and bent

371
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,370
casings bouncing
all over the deck.

372
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,200
And things can get even
crazier for the gunners

373
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,670
when the pilot has to
dodge incoming fire.

374
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,100
If we get engaged, our primary
concern is to hug the round,

375
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,830
guard the primer, and hit
the ground, basically kind

376
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,870
of putting ourself as a
buffer between the primer

377
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,430
and the aircraft.

378
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,800
I know lots of individuals
that have actually

379
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,300
had broken wrist, broken
hands, protecting a round.

380
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,700
R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
Beginning with their rapid fire

381
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,830
introduction in
Vietnam, these gun ships

382
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,270
have seen action in just
about every US engagement

383
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:05,930
since, including operations
in Afghanistan and Iraq.

384
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,130
And there is no doubt that
enemies all over the world

385
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:14,530
know the AC-130's reputation
as a ghostly gunslinger.

386
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:19,370
A lot of times, just the
noise of a C-130 is enough that

387
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,070
the enemy will not do anything.

388
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,030
It stays pretty quiet
when we're overhead.

389
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,500
So a lot of times,
the ground users

390
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,170
will like to have us
just overhead, just

391
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,230
to make some noise.

392
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,670
R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER):
You might just

393
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,070
say that old Spooky can scare
away the bad guys by just

394
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,700
showing up and saying, boo!

395
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,770
I like the squadron's
unofficial motto--

396
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,870
"You can run, but
you only die tired."

397
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,330
Ooh-rah.

398
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,000
Spooky may be America's
primo night fighter,

399
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,200
but it wasn't the first
one, not by a long shot.

400
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,970
This distinction goes
to the P-61 Black Widow.

401
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,900
And Thomas in Rock
Springs, Wyoming

402
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,770
shot me an email asking,
what was the P-61 used for?

403
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,370
Now, that's an easy one.

404
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,370
The Black Widow's
primary mission

405
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,000
was whoopass after dark.

406
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:12,230
R. LEE ERMEY (VOICEOVER): In
1943, the Northrop Aircraft

407
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:16,930
Company rolled out the P-61
Black Widow, the country's

408
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,830
first plane specifically
designed as a night fighter.

409
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,330
Now, you need a hell
of a lot of cojones

410
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,700
to fly these honeys after dark.

411
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,630
Remember, this was in the days
before night vision goggles

412
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,700
and thermal sights.

413
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,230
The key to its success
was a new radar

414
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,530
in the nose that helped
the three-man crew find

415
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,330
their targets.

416
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,670
The Black Widow packed four
50-caliber machine guns

417
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:48,130
in a top turret and four
20-millimeter cannons

418
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,330
in the belly.

419
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:53,430
Most were painted black so the
enemy search lights couldn't

420
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,770
pick them out.

421
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,370
You might say the Black Widow
was our very first stealth

422
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,170
fighter.

423
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,730
Well, we've gotten a look at
a hell of a lot of war birds

424
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,330
and flyboy gear
this time around.

425
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,930
But the thing I keep
thinking is how none of it

426
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,730
would've been possible without
the brains, dedication,

427
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,270
and just plain
grit of our troops.

428
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,400
It's people, not
just planes, that

429
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,330
keep us flying and fighting.

430
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,230
Semper Fi.

431
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,370
Carry on.

432
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,730
I got an email from Lee
in Fort Walton bea--

433
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,430
be-- be-- be-- Florida.

434
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,830
[beep]

435
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,070
I got an offer to go skydiving
with the United States Marine

436
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,370
Corps--

437
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,470
Marine Corps?

438
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,870
[beep]

439
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:36,970
You know, it may--

440
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,200
let me start that over again.

441
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,970
I took a big damn
beat right there

442
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,230
and almost started
talking too early.
