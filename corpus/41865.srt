1
00:01:39,253 --> 00:01:41,483
- Package for Robert Garfield.
- Yeah.

2
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:43,524
- Sign here.
- Thanks.

3
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:42,608
Whenever it wants, the past can come
kicking the door down.

4
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:47,089
And you never know
where it's gonna take you.

5
00:02:47,813 --> 00:02:51,169
All you can do is hope
it's a place you wanna go.

6
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:07,292
You've reached the Garfield family.
Jill and the boys are away.

7
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:09,967
You can reach them on their cells.

8
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:14,371
I'll be on the road for a few days.
Be back Tuesday.

9
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:23,442
On behalf of the president
of the United States...

10
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:25,723
...I present this flag...

11
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:28,288
...for the honorable
service rendered...

12
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:31,969
...by your husband,
Major John Sullivan.

13
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:35,085
- Hey, Sully!
- Hey!

14
00:03:35,293 --> 00:03:38,763
Bobby, I decided what I wanna be.
A magician.

15
00:03:38,973 --> 00:03:43,171
- I'll pull rabbits out of a hat.
- Rabbits will shit in your hat.

16
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:46,046
But I'd be a cool bastard.
Admit it.

17
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:01,408
There's cake at the Veterans Hall.
Of course you're all welcome.

18
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:07,523
- Mr. Garfield.
- Mr. Oliver.

19
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:11,521
- Thanks for sending the glove.
- Been Sully's lawyer forever.

20
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:15,806
Couldn't see why a baseball glove
had to go through probate.

21
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:21,922
- You and Sully were kids together?
- Yeah, there were three of us.

22
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:24,886
Me and Sully, and a girl named Carol.

23
00:04:25,093 --> 00:04:26,890
- Carol Gerber?
- That's right.

24
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:29,049
I'm hoping she'll be here.

25
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:33,607
You didn't hear about Carol?

26
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:37,167
No.

27
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,565
I'm afraid she's dead.

28
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:46,206
I'm so sorry.

29
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:30,201
This street is where it all happened.

30
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:32,811
It's not much now.

31
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:37,124
Why do we always expect home
will stay the same?

32
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:39,810
Nothing else does.

33
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:56,123
It's funny how when you're a kid,
a day can last forever.

34
00:05:56,893 --> 00:06:01,330
Now, all these years
seem just like a blink.

35
00:06:44,373 --> 00:06:46,329
Bobby? Bobby-o?

36
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,086
Time to get a wiggle on.

37
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:50,090
Wake up, Bobby.

38
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:53,768
Hey, wait for me!

39
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,371
Come on, Johnny.

40
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:10,886
Happy birthday, Mr. Eleven. Ta-da!

41
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:22,283
Oh, wow. Library card.

42
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:26,321
A grownup's library card,
if you please.

43
00:07:28,853 --> 00:07:30,366
Thanks, Mom.

44
00:07:31,213 --> 00:07:32,566
- Is...?
- Don't.

45
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:37,132
Don't you think I wanted to get you
a bike? I can't afford it.

46
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:41,451
Know how that makes me feel?
Your father didn't leave us well-off.

47
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:44,645
He did leave us three months'
unpaid rent...

48
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:48,482
...a life insurance policy that lapsed
before he died.

49
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:52,049
He left a rather large stack
of unpaid bills...

50
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:54,369
...which I managed to take care of.

51
00:07:54,613 --> 00:07:57,207
People understand our situation.

52
00:07:57,413 --> 00:07:59,483
Mr. Biderman is a good example...

53
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:02,890
...but it has not been easy.
Do you get that?

54
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:07,530
Your father never met
an inside straight he didn't like.

55
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:11,009
- What's an inside straight?
- Never you mind, Bobby-o.

56
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:16,287
Don't let me catch you playing cards.
I've had enough of that.

57
00:08:16,973 --> 00:08:18,372
Come on, then.

58
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:23,844
That must be the new
upstairs apartment tenant.

59
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:28,849
I don't trust people who move their
things in paper bags. It's slutty.

60
00:08:29,053 --> 00:08:32,728
- He has suitcases.
- Yes, but they don't match, do they?

61
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:35,572
Oh, hello, folks. I'm Ted Brautigan.

62
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:37,570
I'll be living upstairs.

63
00:08:37,773 --> 00:08:40,606
I'm Elizabeth Garfield.
This is my son, Robert.

64
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:43,373
Nice to meet you, Mr. Brattigan.
Tempus fugit.

65
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:46,292
It's Brautigan,
but Ted is fine with me.

66
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:50,288
It's nice to meet you.
I hope you like it here.

67
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:51,932
Thank you, Robert.

68
00:08:56,373 --> 00:08:57,408
Birthday boy!

69
00:08:58,573 --> 00:09:01,690
Carol, it's hard enough
being friends without that.

70
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:04,282
You loved it. Here.

71
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:07,572
- Is this gonna be gushy?
- I don't know.

72
00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:09,565
Better not be.

73
00:09:11,853 --> 00:09:12,808
Whoa.

74
00:09:13,013 --> 00:09:15,243
- Just like it.
- Yeah, that's great.

75
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,651
- Thanks.
- Sure.

76
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:25,405
- Didn't get the bike, did you?
- No big deal. Mom can't afford it.

77
00:09:25,653 --> 00:09:26,881
She buys new dresses.

78
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:31,086
She has to look nice for the office.
Are you coming?

79
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,285
- Yeah.
- Come on.

80
00:09:41,173 --> 00:09:43,084
- Hey, Sully!
- Hey!

81
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:48,487
- Get the bike?
- No.

82
00:09:48,693 --> 00:09:52,402
Well, I got nothing for you.
But happy birthday!

83
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:02,209
Hang on! Wait for me!

84
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:31,528
- What's an inside straight?
- Something to do with gambling.

85
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:36,090
Poker. You draw a middle card.
It's dumb, strictly for suckers.

86
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:46,005
This neighborhood
is getting terribly run-down.

87
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,249
I think I'll have to move.

88
00:10:54,773 --> 00:10:57,241
- Yeah?
- Is that how we answer the phone?

89
00:10:57,493 --> 00:11:01,771
Hi, Mom. I'm sorry. I was just excited
about dinner and all.

90
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:07,165
Mr. Biderman has to work late
and needs me to do the same.

91
00:11:07,373 --> 00:11:10,092
So birthday dinner
at the Colony is off.

92
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:11,248
Okay, Mom.

93
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:15,122
There are leftovers.
I'll be home to tuck you in.

94
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,166
Oh, make sure to turn
off the gas ring...

95
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:20,523
...when you're done with the stove.

96
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:23,531
- I know.
- See you soon.

97
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:41,846
Evening, Robert.

98
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:44,365
Or should I say Bobby?

99
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:47,332
Oh, Mr. Brautigan. Hi.

100
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:48,767
It's Ted.

101
00:11:50,373 --> 00:11:54,605
Sorry. Ted'll be hard for me,
but I'll try.

102
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:57,251
You going out later?

103
00:11:59,773 --> 00:12:02,526
I was supposed to have
a birthday dinner.

104
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:06,487
Mom had to stay at work,
even though she didn't want to.

105
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:11,043
Are you a rich man then...

106
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:14,204
...from your birthday gifts?

107
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,971
A library card?

108
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:24,287
No, an adult library card. Oh, my.

109
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:27,487
All the master storytellers
waiting for you.

110
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:31,402
You know why she picked it?
Because it was free.

111
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:35,768
That doesn't matter.
Don't you give up on this card.

112
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:38,203
Because books can be solid gold.

113
00:12:38,893 --> 00:12:42,886
The great ones have gotten us
through the nights for centuries.

114
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:48,044
Give a writer an hour to hook you.
If he can't, find someone else.

115
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:50,285
Think you can try that?

116
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:54,001
If I don't have anything else to do.

117
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:57,167
Fair enough. Don't be afraid.

118
00:12:57,373 --> 00:13:01,332
A Tale of Two Cities ends
with a beheading, great stuff.

119
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:06,163
Lost Horizon, magic and places
unknown. Can't beat that.

120
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:12,006
Where'd you live before
you came here, Mr...? Ted?

121
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:15,372
Some other place
that wasn't as nice as this.

122
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:17,807
You lived here long?

123
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:21,970
Yes, sir. Since my dad died.

124
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:25,725
- When was that sad day?
- When I was 5.

125
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:28,291
Six years, huh?

126
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:32,290
You must know everything happening
on this street.

127
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:37,891
Sure do. Because nothing happens
on this street.

128
00:13:41,013 --> 00:13:44,369
- Six years.
- That's just a blink.

129
00:13:44,613 --> 00:13:46,649
Someday you'll agree.

130
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:52,124
You know, Ben Jonson called time
"the old bald cheater. "

131
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:53,728
What?

132
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:57,687
Ben Jonson called time
"the old bald cheater. "

133
00:13:57,893 --> 00:13:59,372
I like that.

134
00:13:59,613 --> 00:14:03,686
I think I do too. Who's Ben Jonson?

135
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:06,851
He's an English writer,
dead these many years.

136
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,722
Brilliant, but foolish about money.

137
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:13,642
And given to flatulence.

138
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,809
What's flatulence?

139
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:26,121
Yeah, kids always think
farts are funny.

140
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:33,128
Might have a job for you.
Have to think about it first.

141
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,292
Really?

142
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:38,889
Yeah. If it works out,
you might get that bike.

143
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:45,089
How'd you know I wanted a bike?

144
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:47,965
All kids want bikes.

145
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:20,810
Hey, Mom. I took another look
at that bike.

146
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:25,211
It's a Phantom, 26-incher. Real swell.

147
00:15:25,573 --> 00:15:28,690
No, perfect. Perfect is more like it.

148
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:30,929
Start saving those pennies.

149
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:35,089
Ted? It's me.

150
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:36,728
Hi, kid. Come in.

151
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:39,242
Thanks for making the skyward journey.

152
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:42,293
An icy root beer awaits you as reward.

153
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:44,251
The colder, the better.

154
00:15:45,893 --> 00:15:48,930
One feels them first at the back
of one's eyes.

155
00:15:49,893 --> 00:15:51,326
Feels what?

156
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:56,804
One feels them first
at the back of one's eyes.

157
00:16:02,053 --> 00:16:03,168
Yeah.

158
00:16:05,773 --> 00:16:07,684
Hey, I did like you said.

159
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,128
- What?
- I gave him a couple of hours.

160
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,450
Oh, yeah. Lost Horizon.
What do you think?

161
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:15,371
Better than the Hardy Boys.

162
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:17,092
Yeah, sure is.

163
00:16:20,173 --> 00:16:24,724
Tell me, Bobby, how'd you like
to make a dollar a week?

164
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:26,127
Would I ever?!

165
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,893
Well, my eyes are beginning
to fail me...

166
00:16:29,093 --> 00:16:34,008
...and if you will read me
the Harwich Journal every day...

167
00:16:34,213 --> 00:16:37,205
...headline stuff, sports,
comics, want ads...

168
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,644
...I'll give you said dollar.
What do you say?

169
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,612
What else?

170
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,127
What do you mean?

171
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,801
There's got to be more
to it than that.

172
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:52,170
Yeah, there is.

173
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,565
So, what's the real job?

174
00:16:56,773 --> 00:16:58,764
Keep your eyes open.

175
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:01,726
- For what?
- Low men.

176
00:17:03,173 --> 00:17:04,765
That's right, Bobby.

177
00:17:05,973 --> 00:17:09,409
I use the term "low"
in the Dickensian sense...

178
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:14,323
...meaning dangerous. Men who stop
at nothing to get what they want.

179
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,691
Your real job will simply be...

180
00:17:18,173 --> 00:17:20,050
...to walk around the area...

181
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:24,084
...and if you see them
or find evidence on them...

182
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,170
...you'll alert me immediately.

183
00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:29,683
Okay. And why are they hot
on your trail?

184
00:17:33,693 --> 00:17:38,005
A certain something I have.
Let's leave it at that.

185
00:17:40,053 --> 00:17:41,691
What do they look like?

186
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:47,968
Well, they wear dark clothes,
dark hats.

187
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:51,404
They're kind of anonymous...

188
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,565
...but you can recognize their cars...

189
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,843
...Ioud and flashy.

190
00:17:58,613 --> 00:18:00,888
When they move, they move in packs...

191
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:03,561
...like animals closing
in on the kill.

192
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,129
And they cast long shadows.

193
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,812
Oh, what a world.

194
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:21,045
They're not cops, are they?

195
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:23,325
Or secret agents?

196
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:29,165
Are you asking me if I'm a bad guy
or a commie spy?

197
00:18:30,293 --> 00:18:32,409
I've scamped my share of fines...

198
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,292
...and if there were library police...

199
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:38,172
...I'd be one of their
1 0 most wanted.

200
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:44,043
But I never robbed a bank
or stole a military secret.

201
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:46,091
So who are they?

202
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:49,808
They're thugs, relentless...

203
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:52,528
...when they're after something.

204
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,691
- Like this something you have?
- That's right.

205
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:01,412
And what they want is me,
back under their control.

206
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:04,292
Look out. When they're closing in...

207
00:19:04,973 --> 00:19:08,090
...they leave strange signs in code...

208
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:11,490
...in obvious places
like telephone poles...

209
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:15,368
...posters and notices
for lost pets and lost dogs.

210
00:19:17,893 --> 00:19:21,408
If I knew what they'd do,
they'd never catch me.

211
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:25,931
- What do I do if I see them?
- Run and tell me what you've seen.

212
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,604
Remember when I asked if you knew
what was going on around here?

213
00:19:29,813 --> 00:19:34,250
- Sure.
- That's why you're my man, kiddo.

214
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:44,491
Don't worry,
I won't let the bogeymen get you.

215
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:48,129
- Bobby?
- She can't know what you're thinking.

216
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:52,121
You think she can,
and that's a mother's power.

217
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,812
Mrs. Garfield.

218
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,567
Well, it's very cozy in here.

219
00:20:01,773 --> 00:20:04,492
Mom, Ted... I mean, Mr. Brautigan...

220
00:20:04,693 --> 00:20:08,652
...he's gonna pay me a dollar a week
to read him the paper.

221
00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:11,687
Well, that's very generous.

222
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:15,329
Do you always have boys read to you,
Mr. Brattigan?

223
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:17,251
It's Brautigan, ma'am.

224
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:20,606
And, yes, I need someone to do it.

225
00:20:20,813 --> 00:20:23,646
My eyes aren't what they used to be
since I retired.

226
00:20:23,853 --> 00:20:26,242
And what did you do before that?

227
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:29,485
I worked up north. Various places.

228
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:38,322
Well, come along, Bobby.
Time and tide wait for no man.

229
00:20:39,693 --> 00:20:41,888
- Bye, Mr. Brautigan.
- Bobby.

230
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:53,849
Mom, guess what Mr. Brautigan...

231
00:20:58,613 --> 00:21:00,968
- Something doesn't make sense.
- What?

232
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:04,609
Why would a man his age wanna
spend time with a kid?

233
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:06,132
I don't know.

234
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:10,283
I do know that he said
I must be some lucky kid...

235
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:12,524
...to have a mom who'd let me...

236
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:16,328
...have a grownup library card
for my birthday.

237
00:21:18,013 --> 00:21:20,208
I don't know. I trust him...

238
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:23,405
...about as far as I could
sling a piano.

239
00:21:23,653 --> 00:21:28,602
That's right, spoil it for me.
You never want me to get that bike.

240
00:21:28,813 --> 00:21:31,611
I do, and I wish I could've
gotten it for you.

241
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:34,964
But your father didn't exactly
leave us well-off.

242
00:21:35,853 --> 00:21:37,491
It's only reading.

243
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,847
All right, what's the harm?

244
00:21:46,613 --> 00:21:47,523
Yes, yes, yes!

245
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:51,521
But only on the porch,
mind, in the fresh air.

246
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:52,882
Okay.

247
00:22:09,613 --> 00:22:11,729
- Bye, Bobby.
- Bye, Carol.

248
00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:16,043
Sorry I'm late. I forgot the time.

249
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:17,288
That's all right.

250
00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:21,523
We're all time's captives,
hostages to eternity.

251
00:22:21,733 --> 00:22:22,722
Ben Jonson?

252
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:25,770
No, Boris Pasternak.

253
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,807
He was a Russian
of no account, I think.

254
00:22:30,693 --> 00:22:33,890
What's going on in the world?
Something scurrilous.

255
00:22:34,093 --> 00:22:36,288
"Vice President Richard M. Nixon...

256
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:39,570
...after having won
the Republican nomination...

257
00:22:39,773 --> 00:22:43,812
...on the first ballot,
confers with Henry Cabot Lodge..."

258
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:48,285
- We're going for ice cream.
- Can't. Earning my daily bread.

259
00:22:49,653 --> 00:22:53,089
- Afternoon, Mrs. Gerber. Carol.
- Hi, Ted.

260
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:59,245
I never, ever saw a girl
as special as Carol Gerber.

261
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:01,046
There's millions.

262
00:23:01,253 --> 00:23:02,368
Oh, yeah?

263
00:23:03,813 --> 00:23:06,327
- Have you kissed her yet?
- Yuck!

264
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:09,925
- Well, you will, I promise you.
- Stay away.

265
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:14,962
You will. It will be the kiss
by which all others...

266
00:23:15,173 --> 00:23:19,371
...in your life will be judged,
and found wanting.

267
00:23:21,373 --> 00:23:22,647
Are you done?

268
00:23:24,693 --> 00:23:28,606
Yeah. Come on, read to me. Go on.

269
00:23:28,813 --> 00:23:32,089
- Come back here and do your job.
- Okay.

270
00:23:34,253 --> 00:23:35,811
But you will kiss her.

271
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:42,410
Oh, my God!

272
00:23:51,413 --> 00:23:52,528
Nice going.

273
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:01,971
Get in! Get in, Bobby!

274
00:24:27,413 --> 00:24:30,928
Come on. Come on, Sully.

275
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:32,486
Sully!

276
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:38,328
"FBI announces new measures
to combat Red infiltrators. "

277
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:42,883
- Hey, Bobby.
- Yeah?

278
00:24:43,093 --> 00:24:46,244
Tell me what Dale Arden's wearing
in Flash Gordon.

279
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,483
What is it with you and her?

280
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:54,525
When I was younger I thought
she was a real hotsie-totsie.

281
00:24:55,973 --> 00:25:00,171
Okay, before comics,
we've got sports, baseball.

282
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:04,366
"Maury Wills on the way
to break Ty Cobb's record. "

283
00:25:04,613 --> 00:25:05,568
I saw Cobb.

284
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:10,162
My dad saw Babe Ruth.
He saw him point for the home run.

285
00:25:10,373 --> 00:25:13,524
Against the Cubs.
He told me all about it.

286
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:16,167
He tell you of Nagurski's
comeback game?

287
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:21,882
I know he saw it, though.
Were you there?

288
00:25:22,093 --> 00:25:26,371
- Yeah.
- You and Dad were at the same place.

289
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:29,011
You know about Nagurski?

290
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:32,322
He was my dad's hero, that's all.

291
00:25:32,813 --> 00:25:36,328
The greatest football player ever.
He came to Chicago...

292
00:25:36,573 --> 00:25:39,610
...played eight years
to make the Bears champions.

293
00:25:39,813 --> 00:25:43,488
Then he retired.
When he was old, six years retired...

294
00:25:43,693 --> 00:25:46,002
...the Bears brought him back.

295
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:48,966
Last game of the season,
they played...

296
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,368
...the Cardinals, sworn enemies.

297
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:55,645
The Bears had to beat
the Cardinals to win.

298
00:25:55,933 --> 00:26:00,484
Nagurski wasn't supposed to play.
Third-string fullback.

299
00:26:02,173 --> 00:26:04,562
In the first half
the starter went down.

300
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:08,289
- The second half there was a pileup.
- Oh, no.

301
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,923
If your dad was here
he'd say he was frightened.

302
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:16,763
- He was just so scared.
- But why? Nagurski was in the game.

303
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:19,043
I was scared too. We all were.

304
00:26:19,693 --> 00:26:22,491
We wanted a miracle, you see, Bobby.

305
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:26,523
We wanted him the way he was,
the old Nagurski.

306
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:30,045
We wanted him the way he was
in the old days.

307
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:34,772
Did he do good?
I don't wanna hear this if he didn't.

308
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,368
The quarterback gave him the ball...

309
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:44,010
...and Nagurski ran slowly
up to the line...

310
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:46,569
...and the Cardinals crushed him.

311
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:48,042
But somehow...

312
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:53,529
...somehow, he gained a few yards.

313
00:26:53,853 --> 00:26:55,332
Next play, the same.

314
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:59,612
They just kept giving the ball
to the old man...

315
00:27:00,613 --> 00:27:05,733
...and the Bears began to move down
the field, five yards, seven more.

316
00:27:07,253 --> 00:27:10,882
If he could score for us,
we'd be champions again.

317
00:27:13,653 --> 00:27:16,486
Go on, Ted! You can't stop!

318
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:23,248
Ted!

319
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:26,922
Come on. I gotta know
what happened.

320
00:27:31,893 --> 00:27:33,212
Come on.

321
00:27:33,413 --> 00:27:35,643
You know what your dad did then?

322
00:27:35,853 --> 00:27:37,844
No, what did my father do?

323
00:27:38,053 --> 00:27:42,604
We were all screaming. We couldn't
believe what was happening.

324
00:27:42,813 --> 00:27:44,883
My God, what was it? Go on.

325
00:27:45,573 --> 00:27:49,964
It was our miracle, you see,
because he was crawling.

326
00:27:50,853 --> 00:27:54,209
Bronko Nagurski was crawling
toward the goal line...

327
00:27:54,413 --> 00:27:57,769
...and they did everything
they could to stop him.

328
00:27:58,493 --> 00:28:00,370
But nothing could stop him.

329
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:04,891
Yeah, that's right, Bobby.
Not on that day.

330
00:28:06,733 --> 00:28:09,293
Not when your dad and I
saw the miracle...

331
00:28:09,893 --> 00:28:12,248
...when the old man brought us home.

332
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:18,043
He scored. He scored for us.

333
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:21,805
We were champions again.

334
00:28:22,653 --> 00:28:24,769
I just knew he would.

335
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:32,769
Then he was gone again,
back to the North where he came from.

336
00:28:34,573 --> 00:28:36,564
Bronko Nagurski.

337
00:28:37,813 --> 00:28:40,486
Bobby? Bobby-o!

338
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:59,430
- Ted?
- Yeah?

339
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,912
Well, I know the low men
don't exist...

340
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:06,191
...but if they started
driving around here...

341
00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:10,348
...and the signs started
appearing on the poles... .

342
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:13,917
Well, we both know
that couldn't happen.

343
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:16,797
But if it did...

344
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:29,269
...would you have to go away?

345
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:34,912
It wouldn't be safe
for me here.

346
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,308
And wishing cannot make it so.

347
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:39,958
Bobby!

348
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:58,711
Bobby? This Ted of yours...

349
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,633
...did he say where he's from?

350
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,037
Someplace not as nice as here,
I think.

351
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,274
Well, that doesn't tell us much,
does it?

352
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:17,270
- Anything else?
- Nope.

353
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:22,194
Bobby?

354
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:30,672
- Does he...?
- What?

355
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,638
Nothing.

356
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:41,072
You'll tell me if anything
unusual happens?

357
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:45,232
Hello?

358
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:46,667
Hi.

359
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:51,712
You promised.

360
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,591
I really need the...

361
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:57,278
Who was that?

362
00:30:57,959 --> 00:31:00,427
Nothing, honey.
Just a wrong number.

363
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:09,077
Son of a bitch!

364
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:35,516
- I know it's you!
- Your mom says she's almost ready.

365
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:38,074
- Think Ted would come?
- To the fair?

366
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:41,237
- Don't you think we should ask?
- I guess.

367
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:45,112
- You do it. I'll get Sully.
- Okay.

368
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:51,078
- Do you like being beaten by a girl?
- Hey, no fair.

369
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:06,197
- Mr. Biderman needs me to go in.
- On Saturday?

370
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,392
- Some people have to work for money.
- Mom, you promised.

371
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:13,836
These are just Kools.
Read the advertising:

372
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:18,157
"Kools. They cool the throat. "
They're hardly cigarettes at all.

373
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:19,678
- Mom?
- What?

374
00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:21,870
Can I have money for the rides?

375
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:25,708
You never stop, do you?
Aren't you earning money now?

376
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:26,988
For the bike.

377
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:32,148
If you want to spend it on rides with
your girlfriend, that's your business.

378
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,393
Ted? It's me.
You wanna come to the fair?

379
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:00,828
Ted?

380
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,429
Is everything okay?

381
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,351
Ted, wake up.

382
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:37,437
Ted, you have to help me.

383
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,508
Ted, I don't know what to do.

384
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:43,229
They draw west now.

385
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,996
Who? Jesus, Ted, please.

386
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:50,668
They draw west now,
but they may be back.

387
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:59,034
Ted, please.
You can't die on me.

388
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:01,874
Please... .

389
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:07,917
Oh, my God.

390
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,789
What just happened?

391
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:16,512
I went off again, didn't I?

392
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:21,189
- You mean, like at the fridge?
- Yeah.

393
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:23,959
No, way worse.

394
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:28,192
I thought you were having a fit.

395
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,108
It's all right.

396
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,113
If it happens again,
don't touch me.

397
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,307
Nobody should touch me,
that's all.

398
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:39,357
Sorry.

399
00:34:41,799 --> 00:34:44,916
- Is it safe to leave you alone?
- Yeah.

400
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,672
It's okay.

401
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:55,428
Okay.

402
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,593
Mrs. Gerber's taking us to the fair.

403
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:05,996
Carol and I thought you
might like to come.

404
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:11,068
Thank you, Bobby,
but I think just now, it's not wise.

405
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,070
- Okay.
- Okay.

406
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,589
The cigarettes are on the table.

407
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,636
Thanks, kiddo.

408
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,072
What's so funny?

409
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:35,315
You run along now. Enjoy yourself.
Don't fall out of anything.

410
00:35:56,399 --> 00:35:58,355
Yes! That one.

411
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,594
No!

412
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:21,196
Yes!

413
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:25,157
What are you gonna name it?

414
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:30,353
All right. Step right up!
Hey, who feels lucky?

415
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,829
Find the queen of hearts and win.

416
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:35,678
- It already happened!
- Just once.

417
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:37,551
Easy peas-y Japanese-y.

418
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:40,671
Just find the queen of hearts.

419
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:44,912
- Put down your bet. I'll do it again.
- A quarter.

420
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,108
See, a jack.

421
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:51,593
We got the king and we got the queen.
Tell me where she lands.

422
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,679
- Fortune awaits you.
- That one there.

423
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,833
- Yes!
- Genius.

424
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:05,634
- I told you!
- Wait. Double and add a half-dollar.

425
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:06,908
Okay.

426
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:18,798
That one there.

427
00:37:19,999 --> 00:37:22,832
- Heartbreak.
- That's enough. I have to stop.

428
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,429
- I can spot his moves.
- I better give up then.

429
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:29,273
- Just a quarter.
- One, okay.

430
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:35,828
Up and down, all around.
In and out, all about.

431
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:37,358
Now they're back...

432
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,238
...side by side.

433
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:43,397
Tell me, mister.
Where's she hide?

434
00:37:44,399 --> 00:37:45,673
It's on the right.

435
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,116
No. It's the one on the left.
Right there.

436
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,150
- Okay, enough.
- There she is.

437
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,589
- Bobby was right.
- A prodigy, huh?

438
00:37:56,799 --> 00:38:01,077
- Why don't you win it back?
- I could, but I can't play for money.

439
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,234
A boast-y boy.

440
00:38:02,439 --> 00:38:05,237
Says he can win,
but afraid to back it up.

441
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,069
I could have my money back.
Come on. Beat him.

442
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:13,431
- I can't. Your mother won't be happy.
- Beat him, come on.

443
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:16,790
My mom's never happy.
It's all I got.

444
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:21,948
This is the move that stunned
the sheik of Araby. Behold.

445
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,634
This one here, in the middle.

446
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:40,356
- All right!
- That's it!

447
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:44,028
A lucky guess.

448
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,948
Double your bet.
That way we all go home happy.

449
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:50,318
Fine.

450
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:59,593
This one is five years of my life.

451
00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:40,391
This one here.

452
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,955
Nobody ever beat that shuffle.

453
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,238
Well, mister,
is it or isn't it?

454
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,998
- Yes, that's it! Okay.
- All right!

455
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:59,635
- It was a fluke.
- You bet it was a fluke.

456
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,473
Now beat it, kid.

457
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:08,274
Okay, gang, let's go. That's enough.
Come on, Bobby.

458
00:40:10,879 --> 00:40:13,029
Step right up!
We had a winner!

459
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,912
It's easy as can be.
Easy peas-y Japanese-y!

460
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:25,514
Yes, yes.

461
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:37,552
Don't be afraid.

462
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:41,991
When we swung out, I was afraid
we would fall to our doom.

463
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:45,268
We're as safe as can be.

464
00:40:48,919 --> 00:40:51,387
What do you think you're doing?

465
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:54,278
Well, I thought you wanted me to.

466
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:58,911
I just wasn't ready, that's all.

467
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:00,872
Okay.

468
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:07,713
- Bobby, do it again.
- I better not. You'll tell.

469
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:11,868
No, it'll be our secret.
Hurry, before we go down.

470
00:41:15,759 --> 00:41:18,876
Bobby, I'm dying here.

471
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,231
Thank you.
That was the nicest thing.

472
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:46,194
It'll be the kiss by which
all others will be judged.

473
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:47,593
What?

474
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,798
Sounded better when Ted said it.

475
00:42:10,399 --> 00:42:14,438
You knew, didn't you, where
the queen of hearts was?

476
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:19,348
I could tell what was
going on in his head.

477
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:23,393
Every thought he had, I knew,
and he couldn't fool me.

478
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:26,591
Can you tell what's in Sully's head?

479
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:29,716
Sully's head's always empty.

480
00:42:29,919 --> 00:42:33,912
Oh, yeah? Maybe I'm thinking
of getting a new glove.

481
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:37,270
You are?
Well, what about that one?

482
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:41,158
- Want it?
- Are you kidding? I love it!

483
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:44,112
- Then, Bobby, it's yours.
- It is?

484
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,435
I'll leave it to you in my will.

485
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:51,993
- Sully, you just love doing that!
- I got you again.

486
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,468
You know, when you're young...

487
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:59,432
...you have moments
of such happiness...

488
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:03,308
...you think you're living
in someplace magical...

489
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:06,070
...like Atlantis must have been.

490
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:10,750
- Carol, I owe you $ 75. It's your turn.
- Okay.

491
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:15,153
- Here, give me $25 back.
- Twenty-five.

492
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,077
- Here. $22.
- Okay. Wait, no!

493
00:43:17,279 --> 00:43:21,636
- No! Hold on.
- Oh, yeah. No.

494
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,352
Then we grow up...

495
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,033
...and our hearts break in two.

496
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:30,673
- Yes! I own it!
- Wait, no!

497
00:43:30,879 --> 00:43:33,712
- No, I do.
- He does.

498
00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:50,915
- Come on.
- Hang on.

499
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:55,512
What is it?

500
00:43:59,279 --> 00:44:00,997
I wonder what it means.

501
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:05,438
It means somebody lost their pet,
goofball. Come on.

502
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:08,707
Yeah, but maybe it's a secret code.

503
00:44:08,919 --> 00:44:10,637
What are you talking about?

504
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:13,558
- Fairy. I'll take that!
- I'm not a fairy!

505
00:44:13,759 --> 00:44:16,512
- Don't talk to them!
- How are your tits?

506
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:19,597
- Go away!
- Grow up, Harry Doolin!

507
00:44:21,279 --> 00:44:23,634
The Lone Ranger.

508
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:35,352
- Hi-ho, Silver!
- Bobby, how was school?

509
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:37,470
- Good.
- You'll never guess.

510
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,798
Don... Mr. Biderman
has invited me to a seminar...

511
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:45,514
...on the weekend.
"Real Estate in the '60s. "

512
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:50,588
Mr. Cushman and Mr. Dean are going,
but I was amazed he asked me.

513
00:44:51,879 --> 00:44:53,597
Bobby?

514
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:57,747
I so want to be an agent.
This is a big chance for me.

515
00:44:57,959 --> 00:44:59,597
Great, when is it?

516
00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:01,676
Friday. Just for two nights.

517
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,594
- You can't go to your girlfriend's.
- She's not my girl...

518
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:08,313
Whatever. You can't stay there...

519
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:11,835
...so I'm gonna ask
Sully's mother to put you up.

520
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:13,154
That won't work.

521
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:15,592
But it has to.

522
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:18,394
They're gonna visit his grandma.

523
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:22,555
Just my luck.
Just my rotten luck.

524
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:32,794
Why don't you ask your friend
to come down for a cup of tea?

525
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:34,868
Okay.

526
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,433
I'm sorry, Mrs. Garfield, but no.

527
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:48,308
I wouldn't be much of
a babysitter for Bobby.

528
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:52,398
But I've never been invited
to a real seminar before.

529
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:56,917
You could sleep on the couch,
and you could go to the diner...

530
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,077
...and maybe even take in a movie.

531
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:04,950
I'll tell you what.
If Bobby wants me to, I will.

532
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,118
Bobby?

533
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:14,398
How come you get to have
all the fun?

534
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,713
Don't you want me to better myself?

535
00:46:17,919 --> 00:46:21,514
Yeah, but what about me?
I never get what I want.

536
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:25,229
Who knows?

537
00:46:25,439 --> 00:46:30,388
Maybe I'll get a raise after this.
Who knows what I can afford then?

538
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:36,549
I guess, if it's only a weekend.

539
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:43,672
- Thank you.
- Good.

540
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,198
- Have you ever heard of privacy?
- Sorry.

541
00:47:25,399 --> 00:47:28,550
Wait, you can't just leave.

542
00:47:28,959 --> 00:47:32,793
- What do I do, then?
- Tell me, how do I look?

543
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:36,038
You look like my mom.

544
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,117
The dress!

545
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,154
Wow!

546
00:47:43,439 --> 00:47:44,872
Be an angel.

547
00:47:47,959 --> 00:47:51,793
- Guess it must have cost a ton.
- Don't you start on that.

548
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:30,548
"And in this reporter's opinion...

549
00:48:30,759 --> 00:48:35,071
...the Haywood-Albini fight
could tarnish a sterling record. "

550
00:48:37,759 --> 00:48:40,432
I'd back Hollywood Haywood any day.

551
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:43,353
Ted, you listening?

552
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:45,789
Their senses grow keener.

553
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:54,233
Hey, kiddo, you're too young to smoke.

554
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,111
So how long this time?

555
00:48:57,319 --> 00:49:00,072
Breaking records left and right.

556
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:03,555
Well, they're coming closer.

557
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:08,790
They're doing a good job
of hiding from me.

558
00:49:08,999 --> 00:49:12,958
- Haven't seen a single thing yet.
- Good.

559
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,070
I've been wrong before.

560
00:49:16,959 --> 00:49:18,950
So go on about the fight.

561
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:22,515
Okay. So this old guy, Albini...

562
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:27,110
...he's gonna take on Hollywood
Haywood tomorrow in New York.

563
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:31,756
- Sounds like Albini's gonna get beat.
- It sure does.

564
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:34,317
Well, I might place a bet.

565
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,915
We may go into town
after your mother leaves.

566
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:41,668
Get a bite to eat.
See a movie.

567
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:44,074
Ever hear of Village of the Damned?

568
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:50,388
It's about evil little kids
taken over by alien forces.

569
00:49:54,399 --> 00:49:55,752
There you go.

570
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:10,432
What's up?

571
00:50:11,439 --> 00:50:13,907
Oh, no, your bike.

572
00:50:17,759 --> 00:50:19,715
Stay right there, Bobby.

573
00:50:43,879 --> 00:50:44,914
Thank you.

574
00:50:56,839 --> 00:50:58,955
Hey, Gerber Baby!

575
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:04,189
- Still with your fairy?
- Yeah.

576
00:51:04,399 --> 00:51:05,798
Come on, let's go home.

577
00:51:05,999 --> 00:51:08,638
- Where you going?
- This isn't funny!

578
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:10,955
It's a riot, Gerber Baby.

579
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,078
Hey, lay off her!

580
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,156
Hey, the little guy's a hero.

581
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,353
Stop me, fairy.
Be a man.

582
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:21,515
I asked how your tits were.

583
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:23,311
I wanna feel for myself.

584
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:24,912
Get away from me!

585
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:26,998
Leave her alone!

586
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:29,277
She's just a Gerber Baby.

587
00:51:29,799 --> 00:51:31,551
- Bastard!
- Hey, guys?

588
00:51:31,759 --> 00:51:34,432
- Let's beat this queer up.
- Yeah.

589
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:48,278
- Ted, go home.
- We're all going home, Bobby.

590
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:52,272
Who's that, your fairy godfather?

591
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:56,872
Richie O'Rourke, Willie Shearman,
and Harry Doolin.

592
00:51:57,079 --> 00:51:59,229
The unholy trio of St. Gabe's.

593
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:01,827
How do you know us?

594
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:04,633
Come over here.
Find out what I know.

595
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,115
You're going to apologize.

596
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:21,992
- I don't think so.
- Shall I tell you why?

597
00:52:22,919 --> 00:52:26,150
Because I know your dark secret.

598
00:52:26,359 --> 00:52:29,829
- And I will tell the world.
- I got no secret.

599
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:35,357
You like calling people queer
and fairy and such words?

600
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:38,675
Look in my eyes, Harry Doolin.

601
00:52:39,759 --> 00:52:41,431
Tell me what you see.

602
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:48,511
Do you see someone in your mother's
clothes when he thinks no one is looking?

603
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:52,792
Tell the whole, wide world.

604
00:52:53,719 --> 00:52:55,869
Now say, "I'm sorry, Carol. "

605
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:02,510
I'm sorry, Carol.

606
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:13,150
- What did he say?
- Yeah, what?

607
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:14,678
Nothing.

608
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:19,916
Thank you, kind sir.

609
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:21,791
What did you say to him?

610
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:25,435
Just intellectual chitchat
among men of goodwill.

611
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:29,837
- Ted?
- Yes, sweet Carol?

612
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:34,430
- You're a very strange person.
- Tell no one.

613
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,595
All right, here we go. Come on!

614
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:39,788
Settle down.

615
00:53:39,999 --> 00:53:41,432
Sully's got the ball!

616
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:43,755
- Oh, no!
- Oh, touchdown!

617
00:53:43,959 --> 00:53:45,187
- Get in.
- All right.

618
00:53:45,399 --> 00:53:46,878
- Get the dog!
- Come on!

619
00:53:51,319 --> 00:53:52,957
- And away we go!
- Bye!

620
00:53:53,399 --> 00:53:57,756
- Bye! See you.
- Have a good trip. See you.

621
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,630
Oh, my gosh. The low men.

622
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:31,036
Where's the little lady?

623
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:34,515
There he is. On time.
Give me a little kiss.

624
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,271
Get the bags, dear.

625
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,073
- Good afternoon.
- You look great.

626
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:42,951
- How are you?
- Fine.

627
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:45,548
- Here, I'll take that.
- Thank you.

628
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:48,592
- Need a hand with those, sport?
- Nope.

629
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,229
A real helpful kid there.

630
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:54,518
He's a good boy.

631
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,674
I'm sure he is.

632
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:58,871
- What a beautiful day.
- Yes, it is.

633
00:55:03,439 --> 00:55:05,236
- Mr. Cushman, Mr. Dean.
- Liz.

634
00:55:05,439 --> 00:55:08,112
- Good day for a drive.
- Yes, isn't it?

635
00:55:09,879 --> 00:55:11,107
Women.

636
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:15,909
Always have to bring the farm.

637
00:55:16,359 --> 00:55:18,998
Well, you know what they say.

638
00:55:19,759 --> 00:55:23,752
Can't live with them, can't live
without them, can't shoot them...

639
00:55:24,399 --> 00:55:26,230
...outside of Montana.

640
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:41,195
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

641
00:55:41,399 --> 00:55:44,072
But if you do, name it after me.

642
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,714
I trust him about as far
as I can sling a piano.

643
00:56:01,639 --> 00:56:04,233
Yeah, I'm worried for my mom.

644
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:09,630
I'm worried for us all.

645
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:16,391
- So scary!
- Oh, I know!

646
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,516
- What now?
- Had enough to eat?

647
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:21,870
Are you kidding,
after those hot dogs?

648
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,957
So, what do they call
this part of town?

649
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:28,310
I've heard it referred to
as "down there. "

650
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:32,353
You see, every city
has a place where...

651
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:35,193
...your last name doesn't matter.

652
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:40,198
Wine comes in a paper sack,
and you can buy anything...

653
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:43,553
...if you've got cash in your pocket.

654
00:56:44,759 --> 00:56:46,238
Hey, come on.

655
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:51,188
- Stay close now.
- Don't worry about that.

656
00:56:51,399 --> 00:56:56,189
You shouldn't be in a place like this,
but I can't leave you here. So...

657
00:56:56,399 --> 00:56:57,912
...let's go.

658
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:02,757
Hollywood Haywood versus Eddie Albini,
tomorrow night, New York.

659
00:57:02,959 --> 00:57:04,677
I've got money to burn.

660
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:06,232
What do you say?

661
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:10,431
Not one step.

662
00:57:20,839 --> 00:57:24,514
Making good on that promise,
look how he piles into Freon.

663
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:36,078
Hey, kid.

664
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:37,992
What's your name?

665
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:40,909
Bobby. Bobby Garfield.

666
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,837
Been in before?

667
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:43,949
No, ma'am.

668
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,598
You look familiar.

669
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,551
Did I know your father?

670
00:57:52,679 --> 00:57:55,591
My father's dead.
He died years ago.

671
00:57:56,519 --> 00:57:57,634
Was he Bobby too?

672
00:57:57,919 --> 00:58:00,592
Bobby Garfield. Yes, ma'am.

673
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:03,150
He was just like me.

674
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,190
Yeah, he was a good customer.

675
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,117
I liked him.

676
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:08,958
Yeah, he used to...

677
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:12,196
...stop in for a beer now and then.

678
00:58:13,759 --> 00:58:17,354
Like on Mondays, when it's just
dead in here...

679
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,636
...and in no time flat
we were all laughing.

680
00:58:21,919 --> 00:58:24,592
Yeah, not a mean bone in his body.

681
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:27,357
He was generous too.

682
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:29,994
Not too many like that in here.

683
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:34,549
He'd never buy a drunk a drink.
I admired that.

684
00:58:34,759 --> 00:58:38,115
He also never met an inside
straight he didn't like.

685
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,391
Who told you that?

686
00:58:40,919 --> 00:58:42,830
I remember the big losers.

687
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:45,314
Most nights he walked out of here...

688
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:48,232
...with a little more
than he came in with.

689
00:58:49,879 --> 00:58:53,508
Yeah, he was a hell of a card player,
Bobby was.

690
00:58:59,719 --> 00:59:01,596
Keep that, if you want.

691
00:59:03,319 --> 00:59:05,310
He's handsome, don't you think?

692
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:09,274
You've got that to look forward to.

693
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,351
You got a girlfriend?

694
00:59:13,879 --> 00:59:15,232
Yes, ma'am.

695
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:16,913
Pretty?

696
00:59:17,399 --> 00:59:19,788
Yes, ma'am. Her name's Carol.

697
00:59:19,999 --> 00:59:22,069
She's a real hotsie-totsie.

698
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:26,914
A what?

699
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,677
Let's go. Taxi's waiting.

700
00:59:28,879 --> 00:59:31,837
My dad came here!
He didn't lose our money.

701
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:35,236
He was generous and funny
and people liked him!

702
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:37,316
- Good.
- Isn't that a thing?

703
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:40,312
Yeah. Lucky for us
we came in here, I'd say.

704
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,436
Yes, it is a wonderful thing.

705
00:59:43,919 --> 00:59:47,753
- How much did you bet?
- All I've got. $200 on Albini.

706
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:52,157
- You think Albini can beat Haywood?
- I think he can knock him out.

707
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:54,392
I bet 1 0-to-1 odds.

708
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:57,711
- Do you know anything about boxing?
- Nothing.

709
00:59:57,919 --> 00:59:59,432
1 49 Broad Street.

710
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,032
It'll be on the radio.

711
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:03,116
We'll listen tomorrow night.

712
01:00:03,319 --> 01:00:04,593
I hope you're right.

713
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:08,235
- Oh, no. Here they come! Get down!
- What is it?

714
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:12,398
Take your mind away! Don't be scared.
Think of something else.

715
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:13,708
- How?
- Carol.

716
01:00:13,919 --> 01:00:17,832
Think of Carol. Don't let her go.
Think of a happy memory.

717
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:19,358
Take your mind away!

718
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:22,392
Think of a happy memory.
Don 't let her go.

719
01:01:05,719 --> 01:01:08,108
Good night, kiddo. I'm proud of you.

720
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:11,550
I'm sorry I didn't believe you
about the low men.

721
01:01:11,759 --> 01:01:13,033
I know.

722
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:18,872
Ted, my father never bought
a drunk a drink.

723
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:22,069
What does that mean, exactly?

724
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:27,835
It means he was a good man.
He was honest.

725
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:31,631
And he never added
to the troubles of the world.

726
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:33,033
Okay?

727
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:37,108
- Good night.
- Good night.

728
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:49,188
There's the bell.
Haywood coming out...

729
01:01:49,399 --> 01:01:51,674
...throwing punches, running in.

730
01:01:51,879 --> 01:01:53,995
Now attacking Albini at will.

731
01:01:54,199 --> 01:01:58,750
Albini, arms hanging like weights,
occasionally throwing a weak punch.

732
01:01:58,959 --> 01:02:01,189
The punches are flying! Hollywood...

733
01:02:01,399 --> 01:02:02,752
Oh, my goodness!

734
01:02:02,959 --> 01:02:07,430
Out of nowhere, a right by Albini
hits Hollywood to the head...

735
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:08,668
...and to the mat!

736
01:02:08,879 --> 01:02:11,712
They're counting him out. 8... 9... 1 0!

737
01:02:11,919 --> 01:02:13,068
Oh, my goodness!

738
01:02:13,319 --> 01:02:16,789
One of the most improbable fiinishes
to a fight, ever!

739
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:19,194
Albini has beat Hollywood Haywood!

740
01:02:19,399 --> 01:02:22,118
This one has got to be reviewed!

741
01:02:23,919 --> 01:02:24,829
Wow.

742
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:29,387
You just won 2000 bucks.

743
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:33,915
Hello?

744
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:35,518
Mrs. Garfield.

745
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:37,391
Yes, fine. I'll get him.

746
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:39,317
Bobby? It's your mother.

747
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:40,833
Okay.

748
01:02:43,759 --> 01:02:45,317
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

749
01:02:45,799 --> 01:02:48,359
- Have you missed me?
- Of course I have.

750
01:02:48,879 --> 01:02:51,393
But I'm trying not to be too sad.

751
01:02:51,799 --> 01:02:53,437
Oh, good.

752
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:55,914
- Brush your teeth.
- I did.

753
01:02:56,119 --> 01:02:57,393
Good boy.

754
01:02:57,639 --> 01:03:01,951
I can't chat all night. There's
a cocktail party for us delegates...

755
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:04,719
...down in the ballroom and I'm...

756
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:06,907
Are you there?

757
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,838
I dropped the phone.
I love you, Bobby!

758
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:11,948
Don...!

759
01:03:18,399 --> 01:03:19,912
That's funny.

760
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:24,271
Got cut off.

761
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,869
That 2000... .

762
01:03:37,959 --> 01:03:41,634
- It's traveling money, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.

763
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:50,271
I lied to you. I didn't tell you
about the lost pet sign I saw.

764
01:03:50,479 --> 01:03:51,434
I know.

765
01:03:53,439 --> 01:03:55,350
When will you leave?

766
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:57,954
Tomorrow, when your mother gets back.

767
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:02,072
Collect my winnings from Len Files
at the Corner Pocket...

768
01:04:02,279 --> 01:04:03,268
...then go.

769
01:04:05,479 --> 01:04:07,595
Will I ever see you again?

770
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:10,267
No.

771
01:04:11,759 --> 01:04:14,068
And wishing can't make it so.

772
01:04:22,279 --> 01:04:24,554
I don't want you to go.

773
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:31,547
It's all for the best, kiddo.

774
01:04:31,759 --> 01:04:33,670
It's all for the best.

775
01:04:57,879 --> 01:05:01,838
"In yet another startling
development in Washington...

776
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:06,715
...J. Edgar Hoover, the director of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation...

777
01:05:06,919 --> 01:05:10,958
...today issued a statement denying
the Bureau was involved...

778
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:15,550
...in recruiting psychics
in the battle against Communism. "

779
01:05:22,399 --> 01:05:25,914
That's really what all this is about,
isn't it, Ted?

780
01:05:32,879 --> 01:05:34,597
Want a root beer?

781
01:05:35,479 --> 01:05:40,189
That's the only good thing about you
going. I can't stand that stuff.

782
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:42,398
Yeah, I know.

783
01:05:43,719 --> 01:05:46,472
- Do you know everything?
- Nope.

784
01:05:48,479 --> 01:05:51,073
So what happens when you touch people?

785
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:55,757
I pass on a kind of window
into other people's minds.

786
01:05:57,319 --> 01:06:00,311
Is that why they want you?
This window?

787
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,677
Yeah. I know certain things,
see certain things.

788
01:06:04,879 --> 01:06:08,349
Some see it as a gift,
but to me it's always been a burden.

789
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:10,914
What I see has a value for some.

790
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:13,869
Maybe I escaped them this time.

791
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,273
Thanks.

792
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:17,952
Cheers.

793
01:06:18,279 --> 01:06:19,712
To good health.

794
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:23,678
Oh, well.

795
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:26,919
We're all just passing through, kiddo.

796
01:06:28,039 --> 01:06:30,269
Just passing through, that's all.

797
01:06:32,919 --> 01:06:35,672
Tell Carol I'd like to
say goodbye to her.

798
01:06:35,879 --> 01:06:36,914
Sure.

799
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:44,590
- Hey, Bobby!
- Yeah?

800
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:48,587
I think you should go find her now.

801
01:06:50,199 --> 01:06:51,427
Okay.

802
01:07:24,279 --> 01:07:26,588
- Hey, Bobby.
- Is Carol home?

803
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:28,994
No, she went to the ravine
to read...

804
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:30,757
...by the tree.

805
01:07:56,999 --> 01:07:59,877
You don't scare me, Bobby Garfield.

806
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,274
If it isn't the Gerber Baby.

807
01:08:06,959 --> 01:08:08,358
No! Please!

808
01:08:10,599 --> 01:08:11,554
Harry?

809
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:29,316
Carol! Carol!

810
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:49,114
Is everything okay?

811
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:53,236
He hit me, Bobby. He hit me hard.

812
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:54,667
It's okay.

813
01:08:55,239 --> 01:08:57,150
- I'll go get help!
- No, please!

814
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:00,147
Don't leave me alone.
He might come back.

815
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:01,428
It'll be okay.

816
01:09:01,639 --> 01:09:03,038
Can you walk?

817
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:04,149
I don't know.

818
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:07,112
- Just try, okay?
- Maybe, I don't know.

819
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:11,794
It'll be okay.

820
01:09:12,079 --> 01:09:14,957
It's okay.
Here, try and stand up, okay?

821
01:09:25,159 --> 01:09:28,310
You have to get on my back, okay?

822
01:09:28,559 --> 01:09:32,552
- Bobby, I can't!
- Yes, you can.

823
01:09:33,719 --> 01:09:34,708
You can.

824
01:09:34,919 --> 01:09:38,275
You have to think about
something else, okay?

825
01:09:39,919 --> 01:09:41,830
Here, get on my back.

826
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:45,390
Remember at school how we
rode piggyback at recess?

827
01:09:45,639 --> 01:09:48,107
- Yeah.
- This is just like that, okay?

828
01:10:10,879 --> 01:10:13,916
- Bronko Nagurski.
- Nagurski.

829
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:22,871
Ten yards...

830
01:10:23,079 --> 01:10:25,434
...seven yards...

831
01:10:30,079 --> 01:10:32,468
Nothing could stop him.

832
01:11:02,799 --> 01:11:03,834
Ted!

833
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:07,873
Help.

834
01:11:08,199 --> 01:11:09,837
I think her arm's broken.

835
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:12,109
Come on, Carol. It's all right.

836
01:11:25,799 --> 01:11:26,993
It's all right.

837
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:29,958
My arm.

838
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,354
Bobby, take her hand, all right?

839
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:35,993
Oh, yes.

840
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:40,037
One great, big boy
against one little girl.

841
01:11:40,359 --> 01:11:44,830
He's probably so afraid of you.
Thought you had the heart of a lion.

842
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:47,115
He hurt me, Ted.

843
01:11:47,319 --> 01:11:49,674
I know. Believe me, I know.

844
01:11:50,119 --> 01:11:54,431
Now listen. I've got to look
at your shoulder. Understand?

845
01:11:54,639 --> 01:11:56,357
I don't want to hurt you.

846
01:11:57,639 --> 01:11:59,391
Oh, my.

847
01:11:59,759 --> 01:12:01,556
He broke my arm.

848
01:12:01,759 --> 01:12:04,193
No, I think it's just dislocated.

849
01:12:04,839 --> 01:12:06,591
And I think I can fix it.

850
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:11,798
Are you a doctor, Ted?

851
01:12:11,999 --> 01:12:13,478
No, I'm not a doctor.

852
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,547
But as you noted, I'm very strange.

853
01:12:16,759 --> 01:12:18,875
So who knows what I can do?

854
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,429
Do you have the heart of a lion?

855
01:12:24,959 --> 01:12:27,473
Just close your eyes
and try to relax.

856
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:30,068
Bobby, give me your belt.

857
01:12:31,519 --> 01:12:34,670
Now, Carol, do you know
what pain does?

858
01:12:34,879 --> 01:12:37,234
It rises and travels up the body.

859
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:39,836
That's it. Thank you.

860
01:12:40,039 --> 01:12:41,631
Listen to me, Carol.

861
01:12:41,839 --> 01:12:43,716
Just listen and relax.

862
01:12:43,919 --> 01:12:46,638
I want you to bite down hard
on the belt.

863
01:12:46,839 --> 01:12:51,151
You're going to bite down
on Bobby's belt and catch the pain.

864
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:53,677
Now relax.

865
01:12:53,879 --> 01:12:55,517
Close your eyes.

866
01:12:55,719 --> 01:12:57,198
Keep them closed.

867
01:12:57,399 --> 01:12:59,754
You're safe. Just breathe in.

868
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:03,550
Breathe out. That's it.
There's no pain.

869
01:13:03,839 --> 01:13:06,273
Just listen to my voice.

870
01:13:07,999 --> 01:13:10,832
I can sense them
closing in on me, Bobby.

871
01:13:11,559 --> 01:13:14,710
I know. There's signs everywhere.

872
01:13:14,959 --> 01:13:16,312
Here we go.

873
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:19,198
Bite down hard and catch... Here we go.

874
01:13:22,919 --> 01:13:24,147
All right.

875
01:13:24,639 --> 01:13:25,594
There.

876
01:13:25,799 --> 01:13:27,198
Ted?

877
01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:29,869
It doesn't hurt anymore.

878
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:32,835
You do have the heart of a lion.

879
01:13:33,599 --> 01:13:35,271
You did well, kiddo.

880
01:13:35,519 --> 01:13:37,749
What the hell is going on in here?

881
01:13:38,639 --> 01:13:40,470
Mom, what happened to you?

882
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:45,230
- Take your hands off that little girl!
- Mom, he didn't do anything bad!

883
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:47,834
How dare you touch her!

884
01:13:48,039 --> 01:13:49,677
He didn't hurt her!

885
01:13:49,879 --> 01:13:52,393
I brought her so Ted could help her!

886
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:56,268
Go to your room!
And you! You are going to jail!

887
01:13:56,519 --> 01:13:59,352
What happened to you
didn't happen to her.

888
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,957
- Why's her blouse open?
- Her shoulder's hurt!

889
01:14:03,159 --> 01:14:04,877
I said, go to your room!

890
01:14:05,079 --> 01:14:07,035
What Bobby said was true!

891
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:11,953
Let's clean you up in the bathroom.

892
01:14:12,279 --> 01:14:14,554
He carried me up the hill.

893
01:14:14,759 --> 01:14:16,954
Ted took my pain away.

894
01:14:17,159 --> 01:14:18,831
Don't you touch her!

895
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:21,547
Go in the bathroom.

896
01:14:21,759 --> 01:14:24,796
I'm calling the police
to tell them everything.

897
01:14:25,159 --> 01:14:27,354
Tell them what happened to you.

898
01:14:28,679 --> 01:14:31,147
You weren't there. You couldn't know.

899
01:14:31,359 --> 01:14:32,792
I know.

900
01:14:32,999 --> 01:14:36,514
I know you didn't realize
the seminar would involve that.

901
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:40,678
And I know he's growing up
while your mind is on other things.

902
01:14:44,559 --> 01:14:49,269
I'm taking that child home. And you
better not be here when I get back.

903
01:14:56,799 --> 01:14:59,677
- Be careful.
- I'll be fine, don't worry.

904
01:14:59,879 --> 01:15:02,029
Where will you go till it's dark?

905
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:06,755
The diner near the Corner Pocket,
I guess. Pick up my winnings later.

906
01:15:07,519 --> 01:15:09,430
I want to go with you.

907
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:12,030
Bobby, come inside, please.

908
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,357
Do as she says, kiddo.

909
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:01,235
Yes, is this...

910
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:03,748
...Housatonic-5837?

911
01:16:05,079 --> 01:16:07,957
Yes, well, I have some information
for you...

912
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:10,548
...about Brautigan.

913
01:16:11,079 --> 01:16:14,389
You can find him at
the Corner Pocket tonight...

914
01:16:14,639 --> 01:16:16,038
...in Bridgeport.

915
01:16:16,959 --> 01:16:19,598
Yes. Now, there's a reward...?

916
01:16:19,879 --> 01:16:20,834
Hello?

917
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:22,074
Hello...

918
01:16:26,639 --> 01:16:28,311
Bastards.

919
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:02,195
When your mother writes "bad"...

920
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:05,994
...under a mental picture of someone,
she writes it in ink.

921
01:17:08,639 --> 01:17:12,154
I mean, I knew that, but
I didn't think she'd betray me.

922
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:19,919
See, I need the money to survive...

923
01:17:20,919 --> 01:17:23,672
...and I can't go back
to the Corner Pocket.

924
01:17:24,679 --> 01:17:27,239
And I need time to think...

925
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:29,911
...and there isn't any.

926
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:39,277
Here's what you do.

927
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:41,917
Write a note for me.

928
01:17:42,119 --> 01:17:43,188
A note?

929
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:46,029
Yeah, to the Corner Pocket.

930
01:17:46,559 --> 01:17:48,390
I'll get you your money.

931
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:53,037
I'm not sure this is a good idea.

932
01:17:53,639 --> 01:17:55,197
Ted, take my hands.

933
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:00,997
Don't worry. I won't let
the bogeymen get you.

934
01:18:34,279 --> 01:18:35,678
Hello?

935
01:18:38,679 --> 01:18:40,431
Can I help you?

936
01:18:40,879 --> 01:18:44,667
It's about Brautigan.
He took the train. I saw him go.

937
01:18:44,879 --> 01:18:47,188
Stay out of this, kid.

938
01:18:47,399 --> 01:18:49,708
Brautigan 's our business.

939
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:54,271
Don't hurt him.

940
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:59,236
Please don't hurt him.

941
01:18:59,639 --> 01:19:01,550
Go home, Bobby.

942
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:52,516
Ted, I got the money!

943
01:21:04,679 --> 01:21:06,158
Ted!

944
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:27,674
I wouldn't have missed a minute!

945
01:21:27,919 --> 01:21:29,272
Not a single minute!

946
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:33,194
Not for the whole world!

947
01:21:58,999 --> 01:22:01,559
Where have you been?
I've been worried!

948
01:22:01,759 --> 01:22:03,875
I'm all safe and sound.

949
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:07,708
Do you have any idea
what you just put me through?

950
01:22:07,919 --> 01:22:11,355
You only think about yourself!

951
01:22:12,439 --> 01:22:13,997
- Bobby...
- Ted's gone.

952
01:22:14,199 --> 01:22:16,315
I'll never see him again.

953
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:19,997
So you got everything you wanted.
Happy?

954
01:22:20,199 --> 01:22:22,633
There's no money. I don't have a job.

955
01:22:22,839 --> 01:22:25,114
There's plenty of money now!

956
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:29,351
See how great it worked out,
turning him in?

957
01:22:29,599 --> 01:22:31,794
I did it for you. For your own...

958
01:22:32,079 --> 01:22:35,435
You lie! You always lie.

959
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:40,873
My father was a good man
and people liked him.

960
01:22:42,439 --> 01:22:44,828
Everyone liked him except you.

961
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:47,748
You never liked me either.

962
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:52,391
Then I find a grownup friend
of my own, and you know what?

963
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:54,473
I loved him.

964
01:22:56,119 --> 01:23:00,158
You didn't just betray him;
you betrayed both of us.

965
01:23:10,479 --> 01:23:11,468
Bobby?

966
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:23,990
Ted got it right.

967
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:26,633
It isn 't all Atlantis.

968
01:23:28,199 --> 01:23:31,191
My mother got a job outside of Boston.

969
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:34,795
And I was upset, of course,
but one thing...

970
01:23:34,999 --> 01:23:36,751
I wasn 't afraid.

971
01:23:37,159 --> 01:23:39,627
I had Ted to thank for that.

972
01:23:40,759 --> 01:23:43,751
Hey, get out of here.
This is my place now.

973
01:23:43,959 --> 01:23:46,314
You can't. This is everybody's park.

974
01:23:46,519 --> 01:23:48,111
Yes, I can.

975
01:23:51,279 --> 01:23:52,917
Little Bobby Garfield.

976
01:23:53,639 --> 01:23:56,597
Where's your fairy godfather
when you need him?

977
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,153
That was for the Gerber Baby!

978
01:25:12,599 --> 01:25:14,396
Do you need any help?

979
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:16,038
I'm fine.

980
01:25:35,959 --> 01:25:39,793
Do you think you could ever
see your way to forgiving me?

981
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:46,468
I'm working on it, Mom.

982
01:26:15,239 --> 01:26:18,117
Carol, we're leaving now.

983
01:26:18,839 --> 01:26:20,238
Oh, no.

984
01:26:21,799 --> 01:26:24,438
Here. It's where I'll be
in Massachusetts.

985
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:27,591
- Will you write to me?
- Of course.

986
01:26:27,799 --> 01:26:29,232
I'll write to you.

987
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:32,708
I'll probably be homesick.

988
01:26:33,519 --> 01:26:35,669
I'll never forget you.

989
01:26:41,879 --> 01:26:44,393
Was it you who beat up Harry Doolin?

990
01:26:46,439 --> 01:26:47,588
Good.

991
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:49,628
Good.

992
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:02,275
- Carol, wait.
- I can't. Not now.

993
01:27:04,599 --> 01:27:07,238
- But l...
- I love you too, Bobby Garfield.

994
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:11,269
But I have to go make the salad.

995
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:23,872
9:35, 25 minutes before 1 0
on WKMD...

996
01:27:24,079 --> 01:27:27,310
...serving up the biggest hits
with the Platters.

997
01:27:35,439 --> 01:27:36,997
So, what are we gonna do?

998
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:41,033
The best we can, Mom.
The best we can.

999
01:27:43,639 --> 01:27:46,028
Well, time and tide wait for no man.

1000
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:49,151
Ben Jonson called time
"the old bald cheater. "

1001
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:52,192
- Who was Ben Jonson?
- An English writer.

1002
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:55,709
Foolish about money,
and given to flatulence.

1003
01:27:55,919 --> 01:27:57,591
Flatulence?

1004
01:27:59,119 --> 01:28:01,428
Bobby Garfield!

1005
01:28:30,519 --> 01:28:33,829
Hey!
I don't think you should be in there.

1006
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:36,195
It's not safe.

1007
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:39,152
I used to live here when I was a kid.

1008
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:46,828
- Have you lived here long?
- Only my whole life.

1009
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:50,992
Oh, wait a minute! Wait, wait, wait.

1010
01:28:54,479 --> 01:28:55,878
Was your mother...

1011
01:28:57,759 --> 01:28:59,750
...was she...?

1012
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:03,756
Was she Carol, Carol Gerber?

1013
01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:08,957
- My mom's dead. She died years ago.
- I was sorry to hear that.

1014
01:29:12,039 --> 01:29:15,031
We never kept in touch
like we said we would.

1015
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:21,589
My God.

1016
01:29:21,799 --> 01:29:24,267
You're the boy on the Ferris wheel?

1017
01:29:25,479 --> 01:29:30,792
- Mom told me about that.
- She promised she'd never tell anyone.

1018
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:34,877
She said you were beautiful.

1019
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:39,871
One of us was.

1020
01:30:13,719 --> 01:30:16,597
You can keep that, if you want.

1021
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:20,953
I'm Bobby.

1022
01:30:22,799 --> 01:30:25,871
- Molly.
- Molly.

1023
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:34,033
She had the heart of a lion.

1024
01:31:13,879 --> 01:31:17,269
I never heard from
Ted Brautigan again.

1025
01:31:17,479 --> 01:31:21,552
Not that I didn 't think of him.
I always have...

1026
01:31:21,759 --> 01:31:23,317
...and always will.

1027
01:31:25,159 --> 01:31:30,233
Because that summer was the last
of my childhood.

1028
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:35,317
And though I never again saw
what people were thinking...

1029
01:31:35,519 --> 01:31:39,512
...there was an enduring gift
that he left me.

1030
01:31:40,519 --> 01:31:44,956
What Ted did was open my eyes...

1031
01:31:45,519 --> 01:31:47,749
...and let the future in.

1032
01:31:50,039 --> 01:31:52,678
I wouldn 't have missed a minute of it.

1033
01:31:53,999 --> 01:31:55,910
Not for all the world.
