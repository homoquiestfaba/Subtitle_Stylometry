I do not have enough money
To they pay stay.

127
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,030
Lan Snyder has a plan.

128
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,318
Does he want to talk well with us?
- What have we to lose?

129
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,391
Logical that they got 'm.

Your all may nowhere
Other over have?

131
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:19,200
Do not work hard you from, maid. Close but
At the back in the file for Blake.

Do do not want to hear you the remainder then?
- No, I that story am so sat.

But this is not just a story.

134
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,794
Abel Frye a pus was.

135
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,714
He got what with the girl
Of the part of the school.

136
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,714
That boy pestered Abel always.
- That had to miscarry.

137
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,034
She gave him the ticket stuff everyone
In was. He wept as a kid.

138
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,909
And in the forbidden wing ...
- Keelde he her.

139
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,036
He slaughtered hair.

140
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,796
The forbidden wing?
- If there deaths fall, is the forbidden.

141
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,875
Look, after he her
Had stabbed to death, he hung up.

142
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,273
His spirit roams now by the school
And he gets everybody that 'm calls up.

143
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,750
Like Ian Snyder
And his club with madmen?

144
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,311
How come you to this?
- Crystal Sparks' work hangs everywhere.

145
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,076
Abel has foreseen it now
On the spetters from it football-team.

146
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,913
Jimmy Boltz was the third all.

147
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,236
What smell you, jochie?

148
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,029
What there occurs, jochie?

149
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,191
Is that it?

150
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,555
What smell you well, Max?

151
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,678
There something sits
On this ticket of 50 dollars.

152
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,515
Do your him know occasional?

153
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,197
Listen Lenny,
She nothing deserved.

154
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,149
Know you that I your so
Apart can break?

155
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,838
Par don hear, ...
- Now you must pay attention.

156
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,956
We be even busy.

157
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,111
Do be sometimes problems?

158
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,157
We be busy, I said.

159
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,914
Twister is nice, he?
- Get 'm, Blake.

160
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,198
Against that study spheres?
There I fail on along.

161
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,830
Stuff has Abel his neck opgerekt?
- In the forbidden wing.

162
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,673
That we evade.
- Why?

163
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,037
That you see still.
- We do not go there in, heard.

164
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,279
The old wing has been renewed,
Just like the whole school ...

165
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,159
Maartoen runs out the money.

166
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,276
He, he is open.

167
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,510
In the dictionary is mentioned bans
A picture of dead bystander.

168
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,951
Do you do not go along or yet?
He hangs there no more, heard.

169
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,908
The spirit escaped
In it lop in the walls.

170
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,914
Then he must be in the master builders
And not in us.

171
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,311
Stuff is them along busy?
- She is crazy.

172
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,798
Does everything be fine still, maid?
- Yes, other allows I call well know.

173
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,594
You have a bump on your head, but
With what ice pulls off that well again.

174
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,718
Knocked down by a spirit?

175
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,829
What have been taken place, rate?
- Something has or someone struck me.

176
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,070
Really not ordinary cases?

177
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,552
What is it last what you have seen?
- Stars.

178
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,438
She is again the old man.

179
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,354
And before?
- When I have seen someone.

180
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,069
From this world,
Or from the next?

181
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,275
Why did not close you the school?

182
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,275
The half of the parents intends that also,
The remainder wants that their offspring succeeds.

183
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,913
The school management intends probably be that
That footballers the case not bottles.

184
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,517
Abel Frye has been the only exiled.
- De Jongs that hung up.

185
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:37,118
I accept that everybody at school
This picture has seen well once.

186
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,558
Abel Frye is rather
A school legend be.

187
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,357
... There is something wrong goes without food.
- Completely not.

188
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,275
You have such tin of on-school-sits
A-boy-that-I-find-nice.

189
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,629
Nonsense. We be now undercover,
So I must stay well in my role.

190
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,839
Everybody has fallen
For my role as popular maid.

191
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,992
I not. I am older then you.
- 2 minutes.

192
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,994
But this is something otherwise.
I know jou.

193
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,039
Can you keep a secret?
- Yes, that I vow.

194
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,275
It is something between jou and me
And everybody that I call later tell.

195
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,796
Goh what funny, Elijah.

196
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,671
If I would find someone there nice
And I do not say that that so is ...

197
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,597
Maarstel, what can go wrong there then?
We move frequenter then gypsies.

198
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,832
I am pleased quite with this life ...

199
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,198
But sometimes I wonder well once
How mean other life.

200
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,319
With boys exit,
Madman do and house arrest get.
