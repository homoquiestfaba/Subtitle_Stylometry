couldn't be trusted.

how far gone he was at the end,

That there's a delivered subpoena,
Red Stevens.

I got proof you been cheating me out
of my mineral rights on this land.

to figure out my cut of this operation.

I'm sorry to hear that.

I'm not sure his kind
is even allowed in this courthouse.

773
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,921
Here's what they are claiming.

774
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,721
How fast would you like this to be over?

775
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,370
Real fast.

776
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,964
The subpoena appears
to be in order, but...

777
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,681
Of course it's in order.
What do you think I am, an amateur?

778
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:02,686
Actually, sir, I have no idea
what type of lawyer you are.

779
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:05,241
Before you interrupted me,
I was saying the subpoena is fine.

780
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,811
The problem is the deed of trust.

781
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,440
I took the liberty of pulling it
from the County Hall of Records.

782
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,162
You didn't know what
I'd be asking you to be doing.

783
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,367
How did you know what to look for?

784
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,966
Well, I looked up the subpoena
and it's public record, too.

785
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,849
Don't worry about it.

786
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,721
As I was saying, in pulling the records
I noticed my client purchased the land

787
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,771
and mineral rights from your client
in a land-swap more than two years ago.

788
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,240
30?

789
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,648
Maybe we should wait till
the judge gets here before <i>we...</i>

790
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,245
Just answer the question.

791
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,607
All right, if you insist.

792
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:46,924
The deed was recorded
exactly two years and two months ago.

793
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,488
Texas law says that the statute of
limitation on mineral rights dispute

794
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,611
is two years... on the nose.

795
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,047
Please tell me you knew that.

796
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,083
- Well, I, uh...
- Well, how could you let this happen?

797

Come back here!

799
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,567
You told me this was a sure thing.
You said we'd get a settlement.

800
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:14,166
Tens of thousands of dollars, easy!

801
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:20,089
I'll be! Mr. Hamilton, how'd you like
to work for me full-time?

802
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,446
My business is going through the roof

803
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,931
and I could use a good man
like you around me.

804
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:26,243
Well, Mr. Stevens, I'm honored,
but I do have other clients.

805
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:30,450
OK, OK. Hey, we'll call it
part-time then. Everybody wins.

806
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,047
Somehow, "everybody wins"
means you win first?

807
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,771
Excellent. We understand each other.

808
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,043
- I guess so.
- What do you know about oil?

809
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,328
Well, it's messy.

01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,091
Wow.

816
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,527
That's twice as much as on this patch.

817

That's 600 hundred million
worth of crude.

818

Why ain't this rancher selling?

819

- Red...
- I want this land!

820
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:41,964
We have offered him triple the
going rate. He's just not selling.

821
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:45,727
- So why's he being stubborn?
- Because not everything is about money.

822
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,487
Well, that's a lie.
Everything is about money.

01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,644
Yeah, um, so...

837
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,770
It's a cow.

838
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,806
Now, they've tried it elsewhere
with success,

839
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,122
and I think I can make it work here.

840
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,608
Theoretically, a well on our land

841
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:15,049
could... tap into a neighbor's reserve,

842
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,971
provided, of course,
that you owned the mineral rights.

843
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,606
- What's the downside?
- It's new.

844
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,205
It'll be expensive.

845
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,887
But I think we can get the oil

846
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,486
with minimal environmental damage
to the cow pastures.

847
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,051
How minimal?

848
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:34,005
No idea, actually,
but I just think that

849
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:37,323
"minimal" is a more positive way
to sell it.

850
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:46,722
Jimmy, when I promoted you
to acquisitions,

851
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,804

to jump off a bridge.

852
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,091

853
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,282

854

This is our next play, Hamilton.
We get our hands on that refinery,

856
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,447
we start competing with the big boys.

857
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,523
We control both sides
of the supply chain.

858
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:15,729
Look, it's risky, Red.
I mean, you heard the geologist.

859
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,248
This new way of drilling <i>is...</i>
it's not gonna come cheap.

860
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,641
And I gotta be honest with you,
I don't think we can afford

861
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,770
to leverage both deals
at the same time.

862
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,604
Carnegie believed
in investing in new technology,

863
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:33,209

pushing the limits.

864
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,971
We gotta start thinking
the same way, Hamilton.

865
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:39,841
If we develop new technology,
it gives us an advantage.

866
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,561
I just hope we're not soaring
off a cliff, that's all.

867
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:47,008
I'm not going around and around
about this anymore.

868
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,925
I'll see what I can do.

869
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,526

872

I don't eat meat.

873

- Since when?
- I saw you eat bacon two days ago.

874
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,522

875
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:34,126
Well, these are vegetables, right?
So you can have some of mine.

903

Well, let's cut to the chase here.

904
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,850
- You want the Tulsa refinery.
- Yes, I do.

905
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,368
And we trust that you've
reviewed our proposal.

906
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,887
I did.

907
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,931
Does that mean you accepted it?

908
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,010
Or are we just sitting around here
twiddling our thumbs for nothing?

909
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:19,563
The question is whether or not
I want to sell to you.

910
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,290
- It's that simple.
- That's just ridiculous.

911
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,090
- You don't have another buyer.
- Red...

And usually I need to meet the people
I'm doing business with

917

in order to make my determination.

918

Problem is, you don't
personally impress me.

919
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:51,485
You're rude, self-serving and greedy.

920
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,211

921
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:03,649

You've been with me
for such a long time.

1010
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:59,650
I owe you so much of everything I got.

1011
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:06,241
You been a friend to me...

Hey, Red.

01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,444

Christmas Eve, you met the business end
of a semi on the 205.

01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,247
What day is it?

1021
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:12,246
Happy New Year.

Welcome to 1969.

1023
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,771
I thought...

1024
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:24,445
I thought you were in Tulsa.

1025
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:29,290
You needed some new plumbing,

1026
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,408
so I gave you some of mine.

I need to go back to sleep.

Maybe this could all be a bad dream.

1030
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,321
Starting over...

1031
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,247

1036
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:17,484
We do.

01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,801
Not a stitch different.

1042
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,322
I thought it would, though.
I really did.

1043
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,131
All that time thinking about it
and dreaming about it,

1044
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:53,524
and when it finally happened,
it just happened.

1045
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,680
The world kept moving on forward...

1046
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:04,327
...and there was no one there
to share it with me.

1047

But you did what you said you would.

1048
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,840
You should take pride in that, Red.

1049
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,445
I got all the money in the world.

1050
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:21,804
I traded everything that
was important to me for it.

1051
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,000
It's not too late, Red.

1052
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:31,848

Well, I want to apologize to you.

1074
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,046
- Apologize?
- For what?

1075
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:15,682
For neglecting you over two decades.

1076
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:23,448
I made my work more important...
over you and...

1077
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,127
...more important over your mom.

1078
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,805
I learned a lot of lessons
along the way.

1079
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:43,208
But I ended up burying them in pursuit
of the almighty dollar.

1080
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,442
Is there a bottom line here, Dad?

1081
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,364
I got a plane to catch back
to Princeton.

1082
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:54,007
Your mom and I decided we're gonna start
living life a little bit different.

So future profit from Panhandle Oil

1084
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:02,845
will go into a new fund that we started.

1085
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:07,681
We're gonna start doing
some good in the world.

1086
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:11,606
And we're gonna stop living
for ourselves.

We're gonna to try to learn
how to help others.

funds away to the poor or something?

For the chance to learn
the gift of giving.

that their hearts change.

1108
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,487
I don't need it.
Put it in the foundation.

You sure, son?

1110
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:14,770

1114

And when my dad died...

1115
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,849

The monetary inheritance that we
accumulate to pass on to our children

1118

is not nearly as important
as the personal legacy we pass on.

1119
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,203
I almost forgot.
We have the hearing at ten.

where you want to be this morning?

with those hyenas in court.

1123

What you need to do
is find that special someone

I was hoping you could give me a job.

1129
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:39,446
I could empty the trash,
mop the floors.

1130
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:43,844
If... well, if there were floors,
I'd mop them.

1131
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,241
- Anything you need.
- What about the foundation?

1132
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:51,088
Decided to take a leave of absence
for a few months... maybe six.

with Hamilton in charge.

1134
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:58,326
I tried to tell you.
I wanted to tell you in person...

1135
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:01,927
I understand. I understand
why you did it the way you did.

1136
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,287
It would have taken a bomb
to get my attention.

1137
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:06,124
And I'm sorry for that.

1138
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:09,329
Forgive me for not putting you
first in my life.

1139

I want to shut up and let you talk.
I want to turn the cell off

1140

and just be with you.

1141
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,850
And help you with the things
that are most important to you.

1142
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,688
But what if I'm not enough for you?

1143
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:31,001
I... I can't promise to be perfect.

1144
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:34,164
I know I'll fail from time to time.
But I promise...

1145
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:39,201
...that I'll try as hard as I can.

1146
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:42,362
I realized something

1147
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:45,763
that took my grandpa
a lot of hard knocks to learn.

1148
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,531
Life's greatest fortunes
are the ones closest to you.

You're my fortune, Lex.

1150
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,365
You're worth more to me
than all the money in the world.

1151
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:01,967
And without you, I'm a very poor man.

1152
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:10,529
So I come to you as a poor man,

1153
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:13,968
in need of a fortune
that only you can give me.

1154
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:25,204
I don't want to ask you to do
anything that you're not ready to do.

1155
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:31,049
But this very expensive ring from
the little market down the street...

1156
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:36,210
...is my promise that I'll never stop
trying to be the man

1157
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:38,727
that you deserve and need.

1158
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:43,966
And my promise that I will wait
as long as I have to

1159
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:46,407
for you to be my wife.

1160

that we're both young and healthy.

1169
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:01,331
And what else?

1170
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:04,484
- That you love me.
- (LAUGHS)

- And what else?
- You want the whole list?

I want the whole list. (LAUGHS)

1173
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:13,889
I'm grateful that Emily
brought us together.

1174

Me, too.

1175
