1
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:07,246
DEEP IN MY HEART

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,018
First of all:

3
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:13,666
I'm not Irish.

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,967
it's not another one of those stereotypes:

5
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:18,584
Boston Irish Catholic bigot
living in the projects.

6
00:00:20,194 --> 00:00:21,513
well that we did..
we did live in the projects.

7
00:00:22,274 --> 00:00:23,608
My husband Bob was making $70 a week

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:26,450
and half of that was going to support
the children of his first marriage.

9
00:00:27,688 --> 00:00:31,038
Yeah, he was divorced and he was 15 years older than me.

10
00:00:31,238 --> 00:00:33,784
He was my school bus driver
when I went to high school.

11
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:36,640
He asked for a bite of my Milky Way

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,987
That was the start of our courtship

13
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:42,835
You can bet my family wasn't
delighted to see me marry him

14
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:50,399
but he was a good man, good
husband, good father, good person.

15
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,698
So, there we were,
living on $35 a week with our two girls

16
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,963
but remember this was 1961

17
00:00:59,163 --> 00:01:01,117
$35 went a lot farther than it does now

18
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:02,760
Our Jack was in the White House

19
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,787
looked as if our country had turned a corner

20
00:01:05,987 --> 00:01:07,050
not really political, but I believed that

21
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,546
and our Pope, that was Pope John the 23rd at that time

22
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,204
said we all had to learn to live together
and I believe that too.

23
00:01:15,404 --> 00:01:17,786
And Bob believed that and he was Irish.

24
00:01:17,986 --> 00:01:21,926
When you get right down to it I'm partially Irish too.

25
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,136
Mostly French, but I'm partially Irish.

26
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:39,214
Afterwards, they asked what was a woman
doing out on the streets after midnight?

27
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:44,661
They sure let me know
they believed there was another man.

28
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:48,093
Well, there was another man.
His name was Elvis.

29
00:01:48,293 --> 00:01:49,280
Elvis Presley.

30
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,903
And he had a brand new movie out and I had a
brand new four month old baby.

31
00:01:56,022 --> 00:01:57,078
I was still breastfeeding.

32
00:01:58,248 --> 00:01:59,374
It was my first time out.

33
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,069
Ok, sure.

34
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:08,661
Milky Way Aramis what would you take?

35
00:02:09,647 --> 00:02:12,024
Elvis, he drives me wild.

36
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:16,192
...

37
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,470
See you next week.

38
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,541
Yeah, bye
Bye

39
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,498
So would you like to do the hula-hula?

40
00:04:39,922 --> 00:04:41,106
Gerry...

41
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,074
I was raped..

42
00:04:44,427 --> 00:04:47,176
a colored...

43
00:04:47,672 --> 00:04:49,145
Oh, God!

44
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,697
Daddy, mommy throw up in the bathroom..

45
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,579
You're not hungry, are you?

46
00:06:30,298 --> 00:06:32,164
I'm pregnant.

47
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:34,374
Might be mine?

48
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,809
What if it isn't?
Might be?

49
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,080
We don't have much choice.
We have to wait and see.

50
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,626
Oh, Bob..
Baby, I'll still behalf you.

51
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,660
You didn't consider bringing it home?

52
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,068
That's what you want?

53
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:02,640
I wanted to be our baby

54
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:11,000
I hate to think that inside me is growing...

55
00:07:18,657 --> 00:07:22,170
It's a baby, Gerry, that's all it is.

56
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:36,830
Louis you stay away from that..

57
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,237
John get out of the mud!

58
00:07:40,224 --> 00:07:42,545
The black is a nigger now
You smell like one too, I bet!

59
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:46,739
...

60
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:49,715
What do they got the protest about,
that's what I want to know!

61
00:07:49,915 --> 00:07:51,837
Now it is Mississippi.

62
00:07:52,037 --> 00:07:53,629
If you stay in Roxbury no one's gonna get you any trouble.

63
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:55,739
I don't wanna stay..

64
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,679
like that Sammy Davis jr.

65
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,419
You imagine that Swedish girl having his baby

66
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:03,452
I'm a so-called insider taking your father

67
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:08,352
That's just a baby, that's all it is.

68
00:08:13,238 --> 00:08:14,785
You haven't seen a doctor at all for this pregnancy?

69
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,176
I have two children already, I know how it's done.

70
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,315
I've been nervous.

71
00:08:26,748 --> 00:08:28,490
This might not be my husband's baby.

72
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,589
oh?

73
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,453
I was raped by a negro.

74
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:41,225
Now that changes things quite a bit.

75
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:46,180
We'll know right away, won't we?

76
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:51,050
Not likely, it will be to be hard to tell the
race of a newborn especially in...

77
00:08:52,346 --> 00:08:54,355
I'll send the social worker in to see you.

78
00:08:54,555 --> 00:08:57,329
You started plans
to get the baby up?

79
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:00,779
No, we haven't decided.

80
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,151
I mean, if it turns out to be colored.

81
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,931
We haven't decided.

82
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,395
And how are you gonna feel every time
someone asks you about the father of this child?

83
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:14,579
I..I don't know.

84
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,980
I'll send the social worker in.

85
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,180
This would be a lot easier if you don't get attached.

86
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,982
Doctor!

87
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,961
I tried not to.
Believe me, I tried not to.

88
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,296
In the beginning I prayed to God that one of us would die.

89
00:09:41,235 --> 00:09:46,143
But eight
months is too long to close your heart

90
00:09:47,194 --> 00:09:49,164
against the... yourself living right inside you

91
00:09:52,645 --> 00:09:56,110
It's too late to say don't get
attached now.

92
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,446
Your brother John says she's a beautiful child.

93
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:19,904
Have you seen her yourself?

94
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:21,680
Have I seen her?

95
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:24,029
I gave her my Milky Way, a first Milky way

96
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:26,460
she's a Cummings, she really enjoyed it.

97
00:10:28,178 --> 00:10:29,802
I'm just giving the official word going home

98
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:32,173
I like the name you pick for her, too.

99
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:34,536
Barbra Ann it's good name, Barbra Ann Cummings

100
00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:35,548
Suits her.

101
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:38,019
You see her knuckles?

102
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:40,638
Our babies come out purpose
plums

103
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:51,404
Bob, the doctor says she's gonna stay that way.

104
00:10:57,362 --> 00:10:59,549
I think that she should be with people who look like her.

105
00:11:01,532 --> 00:11:04,568
I don't want anyone
ever to be cruel to her

106
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:10,511
Okay.

107
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:15,548
I told your mother we'd be coming home without the baby

108
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:20,013
I asked her to tell the others
you were too upset to ever hear mentioned again

109
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:23,086
They'll think she's dead.

110
00:11:25,222 --> 00:11:26,851
I suppose that's the best way to think about it.

111
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:32,023
Are you ready?
Yes, Father.

112
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:44,899
What name have you chosen for this child?

113
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:46,555
Barbara Ann.

114
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:05,008
Barbara Ann, I baptize you in the name of
the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen.

115
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,780
You see the light of Christ.

116
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,848
Mrs. Birrell?
Yes

117
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:38,056
Her name's Barbara Ann.
I made it.

118
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,491
When she's adopted,
will they let her take it with her?

119
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:45,506
Probably, I don't have
clothes to spare.

120
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:46,715
Can I call?

121
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,621
I'm pretty sure social
services told you the rules.

122
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:10,469
I suppose you are used to this, but would you not...

123
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:14,182
She'll be fine.
She'll be fine here.

124
00:14:23,336 --> 00:14:26,985
I have no lack of hair, no bracelet, no pictures

125
00:14:27,185 --> 00:14:29,077
none of the things you get even when your baby dies.

126
00:14:29,277 --> 00:14:31,240
So it's hard for me to remember.

127
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:35,732
Guess I wasn't supposed to remember

128
00:14:37,247 --> 00:14:38,523
but I did...

129
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:41,187
every single day

130
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,001
You're sure you want to do this?
Yeah

131
00:14:57,246 --> 00:15:00,405
You're shaking?
I gotta get over that now, don't I?

132
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,651
Can't be blamed every colored man for
what one did.

133
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:06,575
SEGREGATION NOW!

134
00:15:13,283 --> 00:15:15,109
ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL

135
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:16,915
WE NEED BETTER SCHOOLS

136
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:23,659
She's over 2 now.

137
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:25,889
2 and 3/4. Almost 3.

138
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:32,569
You think we can provide the answer?

139
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:35,096
She is in foster care,
she must have been adopted away a long time ago.

140
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:37,337
Maybe they know where she is?

141
00:15:37,944 --> 00:15:40,969
Gerry, Barbra is gone, let her be.

142
00:15:54,815 --> 00:15:57,512
KEEP OUR COUNTRY PURE

143
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:28,834
"We shall overcome"

144
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,799
WE DEMAND FREEDOM NOW!

145
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:08,029
Married people have secrets.
Bob and I had one.

146
00:17:08,229 --> 00:17:11,599
Its name was Barbara

147
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:15,079
We shared it for 24 years.
We didn't talk about it much.

148
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:19,844
After a while when Martin Luther King was murdered

149
00:17:20,044 --> 00:17:21,390
we figured what was the point:

150
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,449
we were the enemy, we killed him.

151
00:17:23,649 --> 00:17:27,973
I didn't think Barbara would ever want to know us.

152
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:32,413
Ghetto?

153
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,410
Well, you say ghetto to
some people and they think...

154
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:41,354
well..I don't have to tell you
what you're thinking, do I?

155
00:17:41,554 --> 00:17:44,573
But it wasn't like that when you lived inside.

156
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:48,503
We had our doctors and lawyers, churches..

157
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:55,572
businesses, we had community,
a good place to raise up children.

158
00:17:55,772 --> 00:17:59,138
and that's just
what I made it my business to do:

159
00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:02,180
first moan and then the abandoned ones.

160
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,268
I raised them up decent, God-fearing and wanted.

161
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:11,263
Then the war came in.

162
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,088
Roger, Stevie, get away from the window!
Close the curtain!

163
00:18:41,506 --> 00:18:42,640
Bob, you're okay?

164
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:46,980
But you're holding onto Scotty so
tightly that you gonna cut off his circulation!

165
00:18:48,914 --> 00:18:50,053
Mom, I'm scared!

166
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:51,879
Stevie! Stevie, come over here!

167
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,769
Scotty, I want you to sit right over there.

168
00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:55,281
Good!

169
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:56,800
Now you come on, Barbara Anne

170
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,060
Ellie you stay right here

171
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,833
I want you to hold Tracy

172
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,643
Then I'll hold on to you.

173
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,104
You see, we have nothing to be scared of,
we're all here together.

174
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:16,477
What's going on outside of our window
everyone else needs a TV to see.

175
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,679
I want it to stop!

176
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:23,226
Sometimes you have to mark great
trouble with great outcry.

177
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,990
He's dead. I never even saw him!

178
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:32,562
I think dr. King has found
a far better home than he had here.

179
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:37,807
I don't think there's any better
home than this, mom.

180
00:19:40,242 --> 00:19:41,980
You're right.

181
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,860
You are right, we are very blessed.

182
00:19:48,760 --> 00:20:00,812
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart

183
00:20:01,012 --> 00:20:03,310
I will pray.

184
00:20:05,775 --> 00:20:16,877
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart

185
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,092
I will wait.

186
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:29,061
Don't push it in shoving!

187
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,441
There him again, mummy!

188
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:35,312
Yeah, I think they're gonna take Larry

189
00:20:36,513 --> 00:20:37,837
Why can't we keep him?

190
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,005
Come on!

191
00:20:40,164 --> 00:20:41,544
We gave him a home when he had need of it.

192
00:20:41,744 --> 00:20:43,744
If he doesn't need it anymore
they'll be others that will!

193
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,435
Now come on
let's try out this birthday bike.

194
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,494
How about a race?

195
00:20:51,838 --> 00:20:52,387
All right.Yeah?

196
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:56,318
On your mark! Get ready, set, go!

197
00:21:07,344 --> 00:21:08,489
All right, that's fine enough, come back!

198
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:09,736
Come back now!

199
00:21:17,338 --> 00:21:19,936
Shall I fix the seat for you?

200
00:21:20,136 --> 00:21:23,891
He didn't have to, he said my legs are just as long as his.

201
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:27,066
Oh well, you certainly do have long legs!

202
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:29,097
Has my daddy had long legs?

203
00:21:30,017 --> 00:21:31,473
I'm sure he did.

204
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,837
But you don't know.
No ma'am, I don't.

205
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:38,008
What about Stevie's daddy and Roger's?

206
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:43,164
Well, I was married to him,
of course I know what kind of legs he had!

207
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:48,391
why am I Cummings and you all are Burrels

208
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:49,927
Barbara, who's been talking to you?

209
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:51,553
This boy at my school.

210
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:57,251
He said you couldn't be my mama
cuz you and me don't have the same name.

211
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,243
You and I.

212
00:21:59,548 --> 00:22:00,665
Are you my mommy?

213
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:02,834
Yes I'm your mommy.

214
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:06,529
I have been your whole life.

215
00:22:06,674 --> 00:22:09,759
You didn't come out of my body
and you don't have my last name

216
00:22:11,156 --> 00:22:14,819
but I'm still your mommy and you're still my baby.

217
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:17,424
Am I gonna be here forever?

218
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:22,008
oh well, you'll grow up, you'll get married

219
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,222
I believe you'll want a home of your own.

220
00:22:24,422 --> 00:22:27,309
No, I won't.
I want to stay here with you.

221
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:33,061
Well, as far as I'm concerned you
can stay here as long as you like

222
00:22:33,261 --> 00:22:34,546
Good.

223
00:22:34,746 --> 00:22:36,157
Do you know what my name is?

224
00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:38,269
I suppose you've changed it.

225
00:22:38,814 --> 00:22:40,078
The last time.
You promise?

226
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:41,206
Yeah
Okay, let me hear.

227
00:22:41,406 --> 00:22:49,704
Barbara Ann Cummings
Sally Ali Suzie Doozy light bulb traffic.

228
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,480
Well, that's a fine name, baby

229
00:22:54,488 --> 00:22:56,057
And I'm not a baby anymore.

230
00:22:56,938 --> 00:22:58,109
Today I'm seven.

231
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:01,271
Well that's seven
precious years you've been mine.

232
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:11,556
Oh mrs. Burrell?
Yes

233
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:13,988
I'm mrs. Mazdan from social services.

234
00:23:15,182 --> 00:23:17,197
Oh, come on in!

235
00:23:18,776 --> 00:23:22,089
I hope you're not bringing me another baby!

236
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:23,907
I have three of them.

237
00:23:24,107 --> 00:23:26,430
Well actually I have great news!

238
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,439
We found a home for Barbara.

239
00:23:30,004 --> 00:23:30,800
Barbara?

240
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,727
Yes uh..Barbara Ann Cummings.

241
00:23:32,927 --> 00:23:35,081
Well she's been here a long time!

242
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:37,320
Barbara's awful old, you know!

243
00:23:37,461 --> 00:23:41,136
I know she's almost 8 but we were
so fortunate in finding a family

244
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,821
that specifically
requested a female unadoptable.

245
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:47,030
There's nothing unadoptable about it.

246
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,640
You just forgot about as all you did.

247
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,400
I'm afraid I have to agree.

248
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,830
The previous worker left this case in a total shambles.

249
00:23:55,623 --> 00:23:57,287
Now when does the little one get back from school?

250
00:23:57,487 --> 00:24:00,025
About 4:00.

251
00:24:01,114 --> 00:24:03,105
I have in that... program?

252
00:24:03,602 --> 00:24:05,145
the buses are
clear out to concord

253
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:06,708
Her teachers recommended it,
she's very bright you know

254
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:08,540
I send along with my son Stevie

255
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,173
I don't distinguish between
Barbara and my own children.

256
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,448
Well that's why you're one of our favorite homes.

257
00:24:14,648 --> 00:24:16,970
Of course we do
pay you to take care of her.

258
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:21,328
Between the babies Scotty and Tracy
they more than eat that up

259
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:24,140
Look, miss Marsden..

260
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:29,084
I'll give it up her share, whatever,
just please don't take her from me.

261
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,539
Corinne, we're trying to get this child out of Roxbury!

262
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,760
Roxbury is what she knows.

263
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,422
Oh she could know...
Ah, this must be Barbara now.

264
00:24:46,622 --> 00:24:49,010
Hi mom!
Hi baby.

265
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,084
You know, you look just like your picture.

266
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,353
You have a picture of me?

267
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:55,965
well not with me but I do have another picture,

268
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:00,888
it's of a family who would very much like
you to come and see them

269
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,679
Everyone else comes
These people will come to my house?

270
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,260
They live in Wisconsin.

271
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,574
That's clear across the country!

272
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:13,097
Now, this is the family.
Would you like to take a look at them?

273
00:25:13,634 --> 00:25:14,837
No ma'am

274
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:19,660
Oh Corrine has so many children
and these people have none

275
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:23,274
Why don't you get
one of those babies, we have plenty of them!

276
00:25:30,294 --> 00:25:31,701
I don't believe you!

277
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,812
They are white,

278
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:38,469
You're gonna take her away from me and
send a thousand miles away to white falks!

279
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:41,100
Corinne, you're making this
far more upsetting than it needs to be!

280
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:43,230
What if I adopt her?
What about that?

281
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:48,330
You're a divorced woman on a limited income
which comes, I might add, entirely from us.

282
00:25:49,306 --> 00:25:51,419
I love her, doesn't that mean anything?

283
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:52,862
They would love her too,

284
00:25:53,062 --> 00:25:56,686
but I can see that you are too
distressed to discuss this rationally.

285
00:25:56,886 --> 00:25:59,692
I'll be picking up Barbara on Thursday.

286
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:02,029
Please make sure that she's ready.
Thursday?

287
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:04,125
That's right.

288
00:26:11,298 --> 00:26:13,600
Hello, Corinne.

289
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,858
What did she say?

290
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:19,968
Well she says to me you already have two children
so why would you want another

291
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:22,532
and I told the truth, to keep Barbara in the family

292
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:24,799
She says that wasn't a good enough reason

293
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:27,032
so I asked her, what would be a good enough reason?

294
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,840
She tells me, somebody who would
be willing to make a home for this child

295
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:33,500
and as far as I can see
Barbara already has a good home

296
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,071
I was trying to make sure she could keep it.

297
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:37,220
She jumped on that one like a shock

298
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,967
"So you admit it, she would be staying
with miss Morelli, not in your home!"

299
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:43,548
I'm sorry
Corinne, I did try

300
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,778
I know you did

301
00:26:49,424 --> 00:26:51,659
I know you did.

302
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:54,430
What if I run away?

303
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,319
What if I don't go?

304
00:26:57,771 --> 00:27:00,390
I don't want to go.

305
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,083
I don't want you to go either

306
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,574
This is just an end of a part of the story

307
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,103
but you have a whole new fright
beginning starting.

308
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,305
I want to be sure that I packed
everything that you want to take.

309
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:30,450
I want you, mamma.

310
00:27:35,562 --> 00:27:37,226
I want you, too.

311
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,386
Where's Barbara Ann?

312
00:28:01,158 --> 00:28:02,447
I hope she's packed.

313
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,410
You know what mr. Cummings said to me
that morning they brought her here?

314
00:28:08,878 --> 00:28:11,213
He said "I suppose you're used to this, we're not"

315
00:28:16,023 --> 00:28:18,510
I'm sorry I was so cold.

316
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,373
She's grieving.

317
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:24,120
She wouldn't even go to the
goodbye party they gave her at school

318
00:28:25,445 --> 00:28:26,987
She's a child, she'll adjust.

319
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,660
You get snatched away from your mama when you
were seven and a half, miss Marsden?

320
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,400
That's irrelevant.

321
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,452
Any colored woman marched up to your house,
grabbed you up

322
00:28:38,652 --> 00:28:40,501
and sent you off with some
colored family in Memphis?

323
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:42,164
Milwaukee isn't Boston.

324
00:28:42,364 --> 00:28:47,170
And you seem to forget that this
child is half white.

325
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:48,377
Half doesn't count in this world!

326
00:28:48,838 --> 00:28:50,620
In the eyes of you people
that is just one more little colored girl!

327
00:28:51,948 --> 00:28:54,333
Why don't you just let her be?

328
00:28:54,508 --> 00:28:57,166
Because it's my job to get her on a
plane to Milwaukee and that's what I intend to do!

329
00:29:19,768 --> 00:29:21,041
I want you to take this with you.

330
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:24,444
I think maybe we ought to leave that here.

331
00:29:24,874 --> 00:29:27,190
I just wanted to have
something to remember us by.

332
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,398
It's not a good idea.
It will make her more comfortable if she takes it

333
00:29:31,094 --> 00:29:32,119
No, no just give it to me, dear

334
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:33,369
just give it to me...

335
00:29:38,953 --> 00:29:41,254
Don't do that!
Let her go! Not like this!

336
00:29:46,444 --> 00:29:47,773
LET HER GO!

337
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,490
Who are you?

338
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:08,055
Barbara Ann Cummings

339
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:15,977
Sally Ally Susie Dusie light ball
traffic

340
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,832
And I love everything you are.

341
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,235
They killed Barbara the day they took her from me.

342
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:13,350
they killed her and I mourned her just like she died

343
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,320
Later, social services called me and said

344
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,879
"Barbara had got to where she
was going and she was happy "

345
00:31:26,328 --> 00:31:27,444
well...

346
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:35,688
she left here but I really
think she never got anywhere else

347
00:31:42,115 --> 00:31:45,778
I was Barbara's mother
that's how I saw her.

348
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:50,283
Adopted child, adopted mother

349
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,532
black...white.

350
00:31:52,732 --> 00:31:56,586
I didn't think it should
make any difference.

351
00:31:56,786 --> 00:32:03,292
My husband and I have already decided
this wasn't the world we wanted to bring a baby into

352
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:11,221
but I thought that maybe we could make a home
for a child who was already here

353
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:15,497
a child who slipped through the cracks

354
00:32:17,464 --> 00:32:24,660
I guess I was wrong
but at least we tried

355
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,080
...so we had to stand all the way to Brooklyn for this?

356
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,820
You don't like it?

357
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,146
Whatever we give her it's gonna
be better than what she had.

358
00:32:32,346 --> 00:32:37,273
This girl spent more time in foster care
than I did in grand school.

359
00:32:37,473 --> 00:32:38,820
I just hope we're not
getting in over our heads

360
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:43,169
oh I've organized that skid row protested
at the missile sites than gas, fog

361
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:44,590
...trampled, okay.

362
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:48,605
So one of us is a tough rod
And I want her so much!

363
00:32:49,473 --> 00:32:52,214
Yeah but if you have a coronary
that just leaves me.

364
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:54,750
Why are you excited?
I don't know

365
00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:01,261
okay, I'll acknowledge a slight tingle,
the one in the car must be frost

366
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:06,239
Here she is! It's that her?
Paul, it's that her?

367
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:08,960
Yeah, it can be!

368
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:17,229
Give me the doll!

369
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:30,744
Hi Brett
Hi Barbara, I'm Annalise.

370
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,584
Thank you.

371
00:33:33,784 --> 00:33:35,050
I'm so happy that you came to live with us.

372
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:41,430
I brought you this.

373
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,832
And this is Paul

374
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,528
Barbra Ann..

375
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:56,587
You... you want to come with me and get your suitcase?

376
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:58,247
We're going home now

377
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,450
It's gonna be your home forever.

378
00:34:02,105 --> 00:34:06,230
you'll see..is gonna be fine

379
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:15,900
it didn't go so bad

380
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,584
she seemed to like your presence

381
00:34:18,784 --> 00:34:22,580
Paul, do you think it's gonna
be okay?

382
00:34:23,802 --> 00:34:25,260
She seemed happy enough to me.

383
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,659
she didn't complain that's different
It is?

384
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:34,409
How can you tell?
Just know.

385
00:34:34,509 --> 00:34:36,830
Must be girl stuff.

386
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,368
...we ask for a boy

387
00:34:39,316 --> 00:34:40,701
No, not at all.

388
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:44,280
A girl should be easier to handle.

389
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,159
Handle, is that what you think we have to do?

390
00:34:46,259 --> 00:34:47,542
Don't be naive Ann!

391
00:34:47,742 --> 00:34:52,800
They told us the older the child
the more the damage!

392
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,348
You have no idea where that girl's been.

393
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:30,760
You can go out, Barbra and play.

394
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,840
That's okay.
I like it inside.

395
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,351
You have any homework?
Already done

396
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,488
Still like your school okay?

397
00:35:44,688 --> 00:35:45,969
oh yeah, that's great.

398
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,458
You know, you can invite your friends
from school over here anytime you want.

399
00:35:51,658 --> 00:35:52,080
okay.

400
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,549
Did anyone ever tell you about your mother?

401
00:35:59,749 --> 00:36:01,980
before me I mean.
Corinne?

402
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:04,286
No, before Corinne

403
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:11,454
She was white.

404
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,010
That's why they thought you'd be okay here

405
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:18,960
You can play with anyone,
you're half white.

406
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,870
Which half?

407
00:36:25,465 --> 00:36:26,340
I think we should move.

408
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,563
I think we should move across town.

409
00:36:29,628 --> 00:36:30,532
What for?

410
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:34,260
I like it here it's close to work

411
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,450
I can walk to the lab.

412
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,283
You're the one who said the schools are the best in the city!

413
00:36:38,483 --> 00:36:42,511
Barbara should occasionally see
people who look like her besides the garbage man.

414
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:44,549
it's true!

415
00:36:45,748 --> 00:36:46,841
she's a kid!

416
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,780
We're gonna change our whole lives
because of an eight-year-old?

417
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,470
she's...

418
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:53,640
After that I got to move all the way over to the other side of town

419
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,830
become a commuter

420
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:58,470
She doesn't have a single friend, she's unhappy

421
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:01,099
yeah, well you know, I'm not so happy myself.

422
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:03,090
I thought we had an arrangement.

423
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:07,616
I'm gonna build buildings you're
gonna build the Great Society,

424
00:37:07,816 --> 00:37:09,281
live our own lives.

425
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:13,586
I believe in what you do, Ann

426
00:37:13,786 --> 00:37:18,290
I work as hard as I do so that
you can do whatever it is you want to do

427
00:37:19,513 --> 00:37:23,550
this it's leaking

428
00:37:23,684 --> 00:37:25,170
taking over it's taking over everything

429
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:28,028
She's your daughter,
you adopted her you gave her your name

430
00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:36,139
yeah

431
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:40,749
Okay

432
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,980
Is this white house with the truck in front.

433
00:38:01,126 --> 00:38:03,450
You want to get out and play?

434
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,180
Just about time.
You're not staying are you?

435
00:38:37,134 --> 00:38:37,628
No.

436
00:38:37,828 --> 00:38:40,610
I asked you to make a choice and you did.

437
00:38:42,325 --> 00:38:44,770
We made a commitment to her.

438
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:48,320
I don't see where I had an option

439
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,600
yeah, well, I guess I do.

440
00:38:52,894 --> 00:38:57,378
I did some figuring, I can cover
ome of the expenses here, but not all.

441
00:39:06,063 --> 00:39:07,753
Welcome to
the real world.

442
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:31,800
What's an Oreo, daddy?
It's a cookie.

443
00:39:32,943 --> 00:39:35,074
it's chocolate on the outside and
vanilla cream inside

444
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,546
Goodbye Barbra Ann.

445
00:41:04,539 --> 00:41:06,268
Daddy's left Barb...

446
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:10,911
but we're gonna be okay
we're gonna be fine

447
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:15,229
This had nothing to do with you

448
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:16,929
It's real important to me that you understand that

449
00:41:17,129 --> 00:41:20,409
Do you understand that, Barbra?

450
00:41:24,117 --> 00:41:26,369
I'm gonna get a job

451
00:41:27,556 --> 00:41:30,999
and I think I'm gonna have to go to
business school in the evening.

452
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:33,525
I will learn how to do what I do and still support us

453
00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:40,209
I won't be able to be with you so much

454
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:41,529
but now you're making friends you won't even miss me.

455
00:41:46,574 --> 00:41:47,675
okay

456
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:52,743
Barb, I go to class.

457
00:41:53,459 --> 00:41:55,778
Dinner's in the oven.

458
00:41:55,978 --> 00:41:56,309
ok.

459
00:41:56,509 --> 00:42:00,489
I won't be back too late.

460
00:42:00,589 --> 00:42:02,829
Mrs Louis is right next door if you get scared.

461
00:42:03,029 --> 00:42:04,845
If you need anything.
okay

462
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,980
You can come and give me a kiss good night

463
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,034
I glue my nails?/

464
00:42:15,048 --> 00:42:17,062
Don't forget to turn the lights down!
okay.

465
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,920
I love you Barb
Me too.

466
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,703
Maybe this weekend we can do something fun

467
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,831
Have a cook out or something.
Ok.

468
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:42,697
Barbra!
I'm leaving now.

469
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,980
See you in the morning.
Don't let anyone in.

470
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,821
Don't go to bed too late you need your rest.

471
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,016
okay

472
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:30,930
Hi, Barb, is Mom.I hope to get you.
Have a good day.

473
00:43:54,683 --> 00:43:56,018
Barb, where the hell are you?

474
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,170
Oh

475
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,548
Barbara are you okay?

476
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,574
Hi, mom.

477
00:44:13,446 --> 00:44:16,710
Who is that man?
What man?

478
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:19,650
A man jumped on your window

479
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:23,700
That's my boyfriend, Dan.
I don't want him in this house.

480
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,600
not if I'm not here
okay

481
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,677
Barbara, I have been sitting in a hotel room,
going out of my mind

482
00:44:32,222 --> 00:44:33,207
You should have called me.

483
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:33,736
okay

484
00:44:33,936 --> 00:44:37,725
I'm trying to talk to you,
don't just say okay.

485
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,361
Yes ma'am.

486
00:44:39,561 --> 00:44:44,298
You're calling ma'am your mother?

487
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:51,230
Curren used to say that.

488
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:55,540
Yes ma'am, you can go outside to play now.

489
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:02,087
I just remembered that.
I'm starting to remember a lot.

490
00:45:03,564 --> 00:45:04,654
What you have got?

491
00:45:05,608 --> 00:45:08,372
You don't have to worry about Don
I'm coming back.

492
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,790
this is Annalise yo Genson Barbra's mother

493
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:28,570
She didn't come home
last night and I was wondering if she's at school.

494
00:45:33,104 --> 00:45:35,403
I didn't want to cause any trouble,

495
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:40,860
I just wondered if she's there.
No, I sent her home.

496
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:53,850
I'm sorry to be the one to tell her, but she refuses to.
She is pregnant, four months pregnant.

497
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:56,830
I thought you want to know.
thank you

498
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,330
Barbra.. what are we going to do

499
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:10,120
I'm moving in with Don sister

500
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,720
could we discuss this?
Discuss what?Giving it away?

501
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,500
What about the baby?

502
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,420
Have you considered what's best for the baby?

503
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,228
Never stop considering that.

504
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:42,830
I love my daughter.

505
00:46:44,543 --> 00:46:46,012
I know she didn't believe that.

506
00:46:47,522 --> 00:46:48,963
I loved her very much.

507
00:46:49,564 --> 00:46:56,100
I would have done anything...
anything to make her happy

508
00:46:56,352 --> 00:47:00,952
until very near the end I thought
we were doing fine.

509
00:47:02,984 --> 00:47:07,557
Not perfect. I'd stopped expecting
perfection a long time ago

510
00:47:10,104 --> 00:47:16,462
what I don't know is that I stopped too
late or too soon.

511
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,915
"Still waters run deep"
that's what Don says.

512
00:47:25,444 --> 00:47:30,522
Sometimes I feel like inside meets an ocean
full of those words I never could speak.

513
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,953
So, I've got to
speak them now

514
00:47:36,538 --> 00:47:38,101
Even if that means backing up a little.

515
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,516
That day she first dropped me off

516
00:47:41,716 --> 00:47:46,070
I did run out onto that street
full of hope and excitement.

517
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:49,900
Then white kids called me nigger
I'd never heard that before.

518
00:47:53,008 --> 00:47:55,578
See, in the suburbs I'd
been a novelty.

519
00:47:56,482 --> 00:47:58,770
I had no friends but people were polite to me.

520
00:47:59,504 --> 00:48:06,398
And now I was just one more black kid
except to the black kids.

521
00:48:08,771 --> 00:48:13,616
They'd seen Anneliese
They called me Oreo, they ran away from me.

522
00:48:13,816 --> 00:48:23,335
From the time I was seven until I was sixteen
I didn't have a single playmate.

523
00:48:23,535 --> 00:48:25,688
a single person to talk to you.

524
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:36,720
Very nice everyone, okay let's take time.

525
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,446
Hold on!

526
00:49:38,646 --> 00:49:40,097
You want to sing?

527
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:44,674
I sit behind your math class, Don Williams.

528
00:49:44,874 --> 00:49:46,208
Yeah. Hi, Don.

529
00:49:46,408 --> 00:49:47,830
Do you like us?

530
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:50,347
Yeah.
Stick around if you want.

531
00:49:52,056 --> 00:49:52,687
No, it's okay.

532
00:49:52,887 --> 00:49:54,759
No, stick around,
I'll walk you home when we'll finish.

533
00:50:04,926 --> 00:50:06,708
there's one thing I can't stand it's a Gabby woman

534
00:50:10,201 --> 00:50:13,411
Those magazines girls they always say ask the man about himself

535
00:50:14,351 --> 00:50:15,008
How do you know that?

536
00:50:16,711 --> 00:50:19,444
To start, I got a bunch of sisters.

537
00:50:21,487 --> 00:50:23,450
You got a bunch of girlfriends too, I bet.

538
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:25,033
I've had a few.

539
00:50:27,504 --> 00:50:28,866
So why did you yell to me in church?

540
00:50:29,066 --> 00:50:30,590
hey, I did't yell in church.

541
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,260
I don't think that's gonna look too good on my record.

542
00:50:33,496 --> 00:50:37,462
You spoke loudly.
That's because you never speak at all.

543
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:40,136
All of mystery

544
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,451
What do you want me to say?

545
00:50:45,591 --> 00:50:47,811
well.. the answer to that problem we got for homework.

546
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,781
That would be a big help.

547
00:50:50,669 --> 00:50:51,987
Notice you get pretty good grades by yourself.

548
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,698
You noticed me?
Yeah

549
00:50:56,898 --> 00:50:58,419
What did you notice?

550
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:06,223
People like you. Do you?

551
00:51:06,423 --> 00:51:09,400
Yeah.
Why?

552
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,729
Big football star singing in church.

553
00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:14,680
One I do for my father, the other for my mother.

554
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,794
Guess which.

555
00:51:15,994 --> 00:51:17,484
You wanna get an icecream?

556
00:51:17,684 --> 00:51:21,339
What do you do for you?

557
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:26,876
... 

558
00:51:33,609 --> 00:51:35,289
hey you're gonna come watch the football game tonight?

559
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,249
you're cold?
No.

560
00:52:20,976 --> 00:52:22,961
yeah, you are. I can see the goosebumps.
Why do you always do that?

561
00:52:23,161 --> 00:52:26,169
Do what?
All right. I see you're not gonna make this easy for me.

562
00:52:29,508 --> 00:52:30,650
Your leather jacket.

563
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:34,122
yeah, you're gonna wear it.

564
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:38,980
That's why we came
well, partly.

565
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,415
Probably because I want you to see this place
I usually come here by myself

566
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:51,760
Sat up here I feel like I could see my dreams
just sitting out there waiting for me to reach it.

567
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:56,090
You got dreams, Barbra?

568
00:52:56,190 --> 00:53:00,380
Have anything to do with me?
Yeah.

569
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:04,155
Till I met you I didn't believe
there was any reason to dream.

570
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:06,800
The dreams
were just little kid things.

571
00:53:06,915 --> 00:53:09,330
I'm a little kid since I was seven and a half.

572
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,780
You could be a little kid to me.

573
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,382
Yeah, I know.

574
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:19,740
You know what flashed into my mind that
minute I saw you that day?

575
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:22,954
when you were singing in the church
just like my mom in Boston used to?

576
00:53:23,154 --> 00:53:26,809
think I look kind of
cute if I didn't have those glasses on.

577
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:32,409
No. Finally I'm gonna get home.

578
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:47,746
She's not here, she didn't come.

579
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:52,269
They're my family now.
We got ours.

580
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,289
We put that red tape here.Now, look.

581
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:09,850
what's that sound like?
Waterball!

582
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:21,370
You sure you can handle another boy?
Sure.

583
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:24,289
Listen, basically you're just fine.
But I can't breathe.

584
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,375
there's no question that you've got a touch of asthma.

585
00:54:26,645 --> 00:54:27,914
You ever had that before?
No.

586
00:54:28,657 --> 00:54:31,320
well how about your family?
He have got asthma?

587
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,910
No, I mean your parents,

588
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:34,952
you know your brothers and sisters

589
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:37,120
I don't know, I was adopted

590
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,957
well you might want to think about getting your medical records
might be a good idea.

591
00:54:40,157 --> 00:54:41,890
How can I do that?

592
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:44,920
Just write to the agency who placed you.

593
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:48,250
Look, about the asthma I don't want to medicate you...

594
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:54,414
I found a certificate in a drawer from
second grade, spelling as something

595
00:54:54,614 --> 00:54:56,355
Ugly as sin!

596
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,162
But she was so proud of it so I kept it.

597
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:00,891
I don't know why.

598
00:55:01,091 --> 00:55:05,678
I kept lots of things that
had to do with Barbara.

599
00:55:05,878 --> 00:55:11,970
even with my
own kids I sometimes didn't do that

600
00:55:13,448 --> 00:55:17,255
I guess I figured she needed somebody

601
00:55:17,567 --> 00:55:20,204
keeping hold of the old days for her.

602
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:25,950
figured some day she turned and looked this way

603
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,630
You know how I call him?

604
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:36,337
a lazy looking laying down peculiar kind of creation

605
00:55:36,537 --> 00:55:38,700
Try one more time.

606
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:44,000
let me see careful
yes sir

607
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:48,620
Now you can go and play

608
00:55:53,871 --> 00:55:55,530
He just look like Scotty.

609
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:59,660
That's Scotty's son.

610
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,114
I don't know you, miss.

611
00:56:05,129 --> 00:56:06,814
Barbra Ann?

612
00:56:16,016 --> 00:56:19,772
Well, I guess you never heard of a
fella who created the telephone!

613
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,756
Look at you!

614
00:56:26,504 --> 00:56:27,696
I wanted to come see you

615
00:56:29,588 --> 00:56:31,501
I wanted to sit in your kitchen

616
00:56:32,049 --> 00:56:35,841
But the kitchen's not out here.

617
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:38,120
Let's get inside.

618
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,435
Your school certificate.

619
00:56:42,635 --> 00:56:45,292
They stopped Department?

620
00:56:45,492 --> 00:56:49,481
I don't know, nothing I can tell the way

621
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:52,030
these kids are behaving today!

622
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:55,653
you were the happiest girl

623
00:56:56,774 --> 00:56:58,997
and you were so thoughtful to..

624
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:02,968
Do you remember that time but I hurt my knee

625
00:57:03,168 --> 00:57:06,893
and you came running to kiss and make it better.

626
00:57:07,093 --> 00:57:10,819
my little Florence Nightingale.. so cute

627
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:20,639
You didn't get it fixed?

628
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:24,630
Well, it wasn't mine to fix.
I saved it for you.

629
00:57:24,813 --> 00:57:27,829
You take it, make it whole again.

630
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:32,715
What's the matter, Barbra?

631
00:57:32,915 --> 00:57:36,737
You don't think that I wanted them
to take you away, do you?

632
00:57:38,727 --> 00:57:40,057
No.

633
00:57:41,285 --> 00:57:43,360
Good!

634
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,273
But you know that's how kids are today

635
00:57:46,501 --> 00:57:49,577
they just think grown-ups can move mountains

636
00:57:51,741 --> 00:57:57,900
but you know sometimes you
just have to take your mountain and stand on it

637
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:02,350
you'll see with two boys and one on the way

638
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:03,440
stand up

639
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,788
But you know, you carry it low.

640
00:58:12,687 --> 00:58:14,920
I believe it's gonna be a girl this time

641
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:16,077
A girl... yeah

642
00:58:16,277 --> 00:58:20,077
My doctor asked me if I had asthma

643
00:58:20,277 --> 00:58:21,850
I couldn't tell him

644
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:24,710
I don't know if I've had measles

645
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,975
I don't know if there's cancer in my family

646
00:58:27,147 --> 00:58:29,052
I don't know anything.

647
00:58:31,044 --> 00:58:32,367
Well, I can tell you one thing:

648
00:58:33,739 --> 00:58:35,698
you are more than a bunch of diseases

649
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:40,987
You are Barbra Ann Cummings Burrell..

650
00:58:41,187 --> 00:58:44,850
now, what's the last name? Williams
Williams...

651
00:58:45,305 --> 00:58:53,940
Sally Ally Suzi Boozie light bull traffic.

652
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,937
and that's just fine.

653
00:58:57,137 --> 00:58:57,803
yeah

654
00:59:00,489 --> 00:59:02,214
But I need to know more.

655
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:04,335
It's okay for me to know more,
right?

656
00:59:05,619 --> 00:59:11,837
As long as knowing more doesn't open a
can of worms that hurt you later.

657
00:59:15,369 --> 00:59:18,364
Adoption file 54542.

658
00:59:18,564 --> 00:59:23,539
Child's name Barbara Ann...
had a child white mother

659
00:59:24,677 --> 00:59:26,701
the mother states a long-term home

660
00:59:29,591 --> 00:59:31,622
I know things
now that I didn't know for a long time

661
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:35,884
I'm still not sure how they're supposed to make me feel

662
00:59:39,821 --> 00:59:42,332
My father's a rapist, if I believe my mother.

663
00:59:48,606 --> 00:59:50,586
If I don't, my mother's a liar.

664
00:59:55,422 --> 01:00:00,139
I look in the mirror who do I see?

665
01:00:02,044 --> 01:00:04,087
so when the kids were grown
we moved down to Florida

666
01:00:05,851 --> 01:00:08,130
I make frequent visits back
and forth to see the kids

667
01:00:08,717 --> 01:00:12,944
and then I'm one of those visits I was
flying back to Orlando.

668
01:00:15,509 --> 01:00:18,316
I was waiting at the airport for about to pick me up.

669
01:00:18,516 --> 01:00:23,420
went to the baggage terminal,
waited him with went to the gate.

670
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:27,240
He never showed up.

671
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,576
And then they announced my name over the loudspeaker

672
01:00:29,776 --> 01:00:34,258
you never know what's coming out of those darn things
until they call your name

673
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:36,668
then you know.

674
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,853
There was a policeman there

675
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,630
told me Bob had had a heart attack

676
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:46,089
crashed the car... died.

677
01:00:48,705 --> 01:00:50,080
He had a Milky way in his pocket

678
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,577
and one of his silly jokes on his lips ready to tell me I'm sure.

679
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:58,194
and his secret, our secret in his heart...

680
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:05,390
Now I had a secret all along.

681
01:01:08,191 --> 01:01:09,465
Oasis are us.

682
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:11,910
You're okay, Gerry?

683
01:01:13,574 --> 01:01:16,125
yeah, sure.
What are you doing with that palm tree?

684
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:17,264
I bought it for you

685
01:01:17,597 --> 01:01:19,563
I thought you might get homesick for coconuts

686
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:23,880
How can I get homesick, you're right next door.

687
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,504
well I'm not a coconut and I'm not Bob

688
01:01:27,062 --> 01:01:29,684
I'm just your twin brother but I'll do my best

689
01:01:29,884 --> 01:01:30,722
yeah you already have

690
01:01:30,922 --> 01:01:33,610
just don't wanna hear what you said to mrs.
Flary to get her to move out of here

691
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:36,830
Maybe I should call and get the phone switched over

692
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:39,020
How do you want to be listed?

693
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:43,520
Jerry Cummins are just a G there

694
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,049
Don't use my middle name.
Eyleen?

695
01:01:45,249 --> 01:01:48,280
Bob always told me to do that.

696
01:01:49,913 --> 01:01:51,452
In case he passed away.

697
01:01:51,652 --> 01:01:53,170
You know, this way then I could always tell

698
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:55,770
if it was just some weirdo was calling me out of the book.

699
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:57,406
Bob thought it hurt

700
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:00,557
Yeah, he was worried, he was so much older

701
01:02:01,956 --> 01:02:03,785
He always figured he'd passed away first.

702
01:02:03,985 --> 01:02:05,706
He didn't seem that old.

703
01:02:07,362 --> 01:02:11,808
yeah, he always had
a kind of a spring to his step if that's the expression

704
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:24,885
I'm hoping..

705
01:02:25,085 --> 01:02:26,995
In that black family

706
01:02:28,288 --> 01:02:31,848
There are a lot of us we just
don't make the six o'clock news.

707
01:02:34,528 --> 01:02:36,929
Don and I have been married for 17 years.

708
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:41,770
We have five kids

709
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:44,830
four boys, one girl.

710
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:49,093
they have grandparents, aunts uncles, cousins.

711
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:53,963
I never had any of those.

712
01:03:05,317 --> 01:03:07,317
Don't spoil your dinner..

713
01:03:22,188 --> 01:03:25,150
just gave it some valid point nine

714
01:03:26,393 --> 01:03:28,050
That's somebody we know?

715
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:29,270
That would be your daughter Karen
Oh

716
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:31,304
As much as I'd like to kiss your neck

717
01:03:31,504 --> 01:03:33,669
I told my daughter I'll help with the history project
What history project?

718
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:35,060
She's gotta make some sort of family tree

719
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:37,930
What's she gonna do for my side?

720
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:40,270
She said she wants to make it up.

721
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:08,918
adoption file 54542 R and G married
December 1957 mother high school graduate

722
01:04:09,118 --> 01:04:10,381
has a twin brother.

723
01:04:10,581 --> 01:04:15,281
Returning home from the
movies was raped by a Negro man

724
01:04:23,959 --> 01:04:26,150
Barbra did you sleep at all?

725
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:27,106
No.

726
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,614
You still got us

727
01:04:42,814 --> 01:04:45,787
I've got your whole family,
it should be enough for me.

728
01:04:45,987 --> 01:04:48,358
I got my whole family too but I still needed you.

729
01:04:48,558 --> 01:04:50,483
She threw me away.

730
01:04:50,683 --> 01:04:52,609
She carried you for nine months,
that's gotta mean something.

731
01:04:53,133 --> 01:04:55,310
She didn't have a choice, she was Catholic.

732
01:04:56,797 --> 01:04:58,235
Anyway abortion was still illegal.

733
01:05:00,335 --> 01:05:01,668
The whole pregnancy must have been hell

734
01:05:01,868 --> 01:05:03,783
and then here I come looking
like the one who raped her.

735
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,751
Are you gonna look like her too?

736
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:11,720
That adoption file said that
she cried when she gave you up

737
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,341
that she asked if she can visit you.

738
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:17,289
She wished the circumstances
would have allowed her to keep you.

739
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:24,497
You think the circumstances
have changed enough in 34 years?

740
01:05:24,697 --> 01:05:27,915
To make her want me?

741
01:05:28,115 --> 01:05:30,260
Sweetheart...

742
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:33,369
you won't know till you find her.

743
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:08,480
Geraldine Cummins maiden name Nephew.

744
01:07:07,629 --> 01:07:08,027
Hello

745
01:07:08,227 --> 01:07:11,089
Hello, my name is Barbara Williams.

746
01:07:12,544 --> 01:07:15,941
I'm calling from Milwaukee,
could I speak with Gerald, please?

747
01:07:16,585 --> 01:07:17,247
This is Gerald.

748
01:07:17,447 --> 01:07:19,829
Actually, I'm trying to locate your sister,
Geraldine.

749
01:07:19,932 --> 01:07:23,551
Geraldine Cummings..

750
01:07:23,751 --> 01:07:25,179
What for?

751
01:07:25,271 --> 01:07:26,554
I'm not a bill collector or anything.

752
01:07:26,754 --> 01:07:30,191
I was adopted when I was a child.

753
01:07:30,391 --> 01:07:34,588
and I'm trying to find my birth mother
and I believe Geraldine could help me with that.

754
01:07:35,029 --> 01:07:39,163
My sister doesn't know anybody in Milwaukee.

755
01:07:39,363 --> 01:07:40,678
Yes, she does.

756
01:07:43,379 --> 01:07:45,375
What did you say your name was?

757
01:07:45,575 --> 01:07:48,277
Barbara.
Barbara Ann Williams.

758
01:07:49,507 --> 01:07:52,489
I'd really appreciate it if you took my number
and tell her that I called

759
01:07:53,045 --> 01:07:54,509
yeah okay

760
01:07:57,515 --> 01:08:00,307
What is it?
414...

761
01:08:03,799 --> 01:08:05,344
Ok,thank you.

762
01:08:07,037 --> 01:08:14,379
I found her.
I found her!

763
01:08:15,279 --> 01:08:18,293
I was surprisingly calm after the call

764
01:08:21,579 --> 01:08:24,481
It was like... I found her.

765
01:08:24,681 --> 01:08:31,855
I found my mom and if she didn't call
me it was okay I done all I could

766
01:08:38,194 --> 01:08:40,017
at least that's what I told myself in the beginning.

767
01:08:40,644 --> 01:08:43,478
Ten seven days went by.

768
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:58,608
I think we got far here but there's a couple more in the vent

769
01:08:58,808 --> 01:09:01,459
Max

770
01:09:04,464 --> 01:09:07,533

Aloha.

01:09:07,733 --> 01:09:11,813
so when you get back?

772
01:09:12,013 --> 01:09:12,760
How was Hawaii?

773
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,594
I didn't go to Hawaii, I went to Oahu.

774
01:09:16,794 --> 01:09:19,817
It's a lot warmer there.

775
01:09:20,017 --> 01:09:22,928
Put one of these windy under there yeah
oh yeah

776
01:09:23,128 --> 01:09:27,642
Before I left I got this strange phone
call from a woman in Wisconsin

777
01:09:28,401 --> 01:09:30,921
She said she was looking for you.

01:09:46,948 --> 01:09:50,844
yeah, she left her phone number and everything.
She said she was looking for a mother.

783
01:09:51,044 --> 01:09:52,842
Why don't you give it to me?

784
01:09:53,042 --> 01:09:56,106
and I'll give her a call see what it's all about.

785
01:09:56,306 --> 01:09:59,370
so I got to go by work

786
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,180
see if they gave my job away

787
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:04,550
Give me a call after you talk to,
I want to know what's going on.

788
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:07,920
yeah, yeah sure.

789
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:34,310
Barbara's back.

790
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:25,430
Gerald..

791
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:29,229
I need to talk to you.

792
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:34,569
So what's the big news, you get married?
Yeah, right.

793
01:11:35,274 --> 01:11:36,645
Finally learn to drive or something?

794
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:38,564
Nothing that dangerous.

795
01:11:38,764 --> 01:11:41,195
Want some tea?

796
01:11:41,455 --> 01:11:44,159
Is this about that phone call?

797
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:52,090
yeah.

798
01:11:53,795 --> 01:11:56,240
you know her? yeah, I know her,

799
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,816
She's my daughter.

800
01:12:05,511 --> 01:12:08,365
The baby that I saw.
The baby that died.

801
01:12:11,435 --> 01:12:12,758
but she didn't.

802
01:12:18,755 --> 01:12:19,987
why?

803
01:12:20,389 --> 01:12:24,508
How could you walk away from
your own flesh and blood like that?

804
01:12:27,712 --> 01:12:28,938
I was raped

805
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:34,191
by a black man.

806
01:12:37,174 --> 01:12:38,054
you were raped..

807
01:12:43,564 --> 01:12:46,699
So she's a black girl.
Yeah

808
01:12:47,408 --> 01:12:51,069
What are you gonna do?
She's my daughter, she's looking for her mother.

809
01:12:53,913 --> 01:12:55,058
I'm gonna call her.

810
01:12:55,258 --> 01:12:58,019
What about the kids?

811
01:12:58,219 --> 01:12:59,229
Look, I think we raised them right,
anyway I hope so.

812
01:12:59,429 --> 01:13:01,559
I'm sure they'll accept her.

813
01:13:03,759 --> 01:13:05,209
What about everybody else?

814
01:13:07,409 --> 01:13:10,829
The whole world's gonna know you were raped.

815
01:13:11,029 --> 01:13:12,449
Everybody's gonna know
you were raped by a black man.

816
01:13:18,499 --> 01:13:20,270
I don't care.

817
01:13:22,105 --> 01:13:25,570
She's back and I'm not gonna
say no to her again.

818
01:13:36,424 --> 01:13:37,237
okay

819
01:13:43,671 --> 01:13:44,170
okay

820
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:49,131
Do you want me to be here
while you make the call?

821
01:13:54,257 --> 01:13:57,000
you call me after

822
01:13:59,202 --> 01:14:00,814
call me after

823
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:34,725

824
01:14:38,372 --> 01:14:39,740
oh yeah hold on

825
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:41,824
Barbara

826
01:14:42,024 --> 01:14:43,026
Yes

827
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:45,940
but

828
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,450
hello

829
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:59,149
Barbara
yeah

830
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:05,175
this is Jerry I understand you're looking for me

831
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,207
I think you're my mother

832
01:15:10,504 --> 01:15:12,712
no, I don't think so.

833
01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:17,170
I am your mother

834
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:24,090
family

835
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:10,980
Hi, Barb

836
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:14,026
I wanted to tell you that I found my mother.
My birth mother.

837
01:16:16,595 --> 01:16:19,610
I'm glad you have closure.

838
01:16:19,637 --> 01:16:25,573
My mom's name is Geraldine.
She cried when she gave me up

839
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:29,398
She was raped but she still loved me.

840
01:16:31,175 --> 01:16:32,606
It turns out Corinne tried to adopt me too

841
01:16:35,073 --> 01:16:36,991
but she was turned down by Social Services.

842
01:16:37,235 --> 01:16:38,350
They wanted me to come here.

843
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:44,618
I guess you think they were wrong.

844
01:16:44,818 --> 01:16:46,008
Don't you?

845
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:49,031
I thought you hated me.

846
01:16:49,835 --> 01:16:51,203
Me?

847
01:16:51,403 --> 01:16:53,228
No.

848
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:59,436
Barbara, I love you, you're my daughter,
the only daughter I've ever had.

849
01:16:59,636 --> 01:17:04,838
You mean even after everything,
you still think about me?

850
01:17:05,038 --> 01:17:07,876
I think about you constantly.

851
01:17:08,076 --> 01:17:09,596
And your baby?

852
01:17:09,796 --> 01:17:11,768
I have five babies now.

853
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:18,600
Five children...
Four boys and a girl. You should see them sometime.

854
01:17:23,657 --> 01:17:24,761
I'd love that.

855
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:39,075
The thing I hate most is for

856
01:17:39,275 --> 01:17:41,592
people to come away from this saying:

857
01:17:41,792 --> 01:17:46,969
"well, black should stay with blacks
whites with whites"

858
01:17:47,734 --> 01:17:51,852
I still believe we have no hope unless we learn to talk together

859
01:17:52,052 --> 01:17:56,553
and not talk about ways but talk about love.

860
01:17:58,048 --> 01:18:02,709
need a flower girl she's already married

861
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:07,703
mom it's gonna be fine

862
01:18:07,903 --> 01:18:09,753
I look okay?
You look great!

863
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:11,039
My stomach is jumping

864
01:18:12,509 --> 01:18:13,827
Mom, you want to wait in the car?

865
01:18:14,186 --> 01:18:15,379
I mean we can meet her then bring her back to you.

866
01:18:15,579 --> 01:18:17,174
yeah we'll follow the pedals

867
01:18:17,374 --> 01:18:20,280
I'm gonna be here when
she gets off that plane.

868
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,500
You're so beautiful!

869
01:19:39,234 --> 01:19:41,234
Let's go!

870
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:56,749
Good night, Gerald!

871
01:19:56,949 --> 01:20:00,850
hey hey hey, relax! you're guest!

872
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:03,454
No, she's not!
She's a Cummins!

873
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,766
Better watch out!
She's gonna have you wallpaper in the bathroom!

874
01:20:07,966 --> 01:20:10,338
I gotta get home.

875
01:20:10,765 --> 01:20:12,219
See you tomorrow.

876
01:20:13,049 --> 01:20:15,030
Following Carol?

877
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,273
I'll see you tomorrow.
okay

878
01:20:28,178 --> 01:20:31,062
So, we were doing all the talking

879
01:20:31,262 --> 01:20:34,226
I'm not to catch up on

880
01:20:34,426 --> 01:20:36,116
...

881
01:20:36,316 --> 01:20:38,360
My whole life.

882
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:51,307
So, how is your life?
Fine

883
01:20:54,507 --> 01:20:57,980
Don is terrific, the kids are terrific.
 I can't imagine living without them.

884
01:21:00,936 --> 01:21:02,835
I do this, too.

885
01:21:04,147 --> 01:21:07,060
I put up photographs on the wall

886
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:08,570
We are four generations on our wall

887
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:09,820
Don's side.

888
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:12,405
My side's a little sparse.

889
01:21:14,128 --> 01:21:17,260
Can imagine
you're gonna have plenty of pictures now.

890
01:21:18,501 --> 01:21:20,195
Harold's collecting them.

891
01:21:20,222 --> 01:21:22,687
you're gonna have wall to wall comments

892
01:21:23,287 --> 01:21:26,119
My Bob was wonderful man.
I wish you could have known him.

893
01:21:28,547 --> 01:21:29,733
But he wasn't my father.

894
01:21:31,488 --> 01:21:33,064
Didn't matter to him.

895
01:21:34,711 --> 01:21:36,305
It matters to me.

896
01:21:38,441 --> 01:21:40,379
My father was black.

897
01:21:40,919 --> 01:21:41,684
A rapist.

898
01:21:42,017 --> 01:21:43,172
I read the adoption file.

899
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:45,793
I hate him.

900
01:21:47,229 --> 01:21:48,305
Don't.

901
01:21:50,978 --> 01:21:54,082
I forgave him the minute I saw you,
for you for me.

902
01:21:54,282 --> 01:21:56,729
He made the black part of me ugly

903
01:21:58,864 --> 01:22:00,540
and I haven't had a great history with white people, so what..

904
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:04,254
there's no part of me I want to be

905
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:09,604
I never forgot you.

906
01:22:09,804 --> 01:22:11,571
I want you to know that first.

907
01:22:12,056 --> 01:22:14,527
I was always thinking of you.

908
01:22:16,873 --> 01:22:19,886
Even though I spent a lifetime
trying to pretend I've never known you...

909
01:22:20,349 --> 01:22:22,654
never held you

910
01:22:22,854 --> 01:22:26,208
The day I gave you away
to Corinne was the worst day of my life.

911
01:22:26,933 --> 01:22:29,054
Cry and cry and cry.
Why?

912
01:22:33,723 --> 01:22:37,270
You are part of me.I loved you.

913
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:40,674
You loved me?
You loved me.

914
01:22:40,874 --> 01:22:47,773
well you loved me , a little pink baby

915
01:22:47,973 --> 01:22:50,760
and then when I started to turn brown you..

916
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,316
No!
Said then what?

917
01:22:52,516 --> 01:22:53,492
Because I don't understand

918
01:22:57,162 --> 01:22:58,401
I'm sorry

919
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:00,566
No, it's all right.

920
01:23:02,329 --> 01:23:03,329
it's okay

921
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:04,541
No, it's not ok.

922
01:23:11,854 --> 01:23:13,255
I came here to love you.

923
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:14,558
What does love mean?

924
01:23:14,758 --> 01:23:16,522
You loved me and you gave me away.

925
01:23:18,222 --> 01:23:22,001
I thought I was doing what was best for you.

926
01:23:26,973 --> 01:23:28,678
If my father was white
would you have brought me home?

927
01:23:28,878 --> 01:23:31,203
oh darling, you have no idea... what I did
Answer...answer the question

928
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:37,320
If my father was white
would you have kept me?

929
01:23:40,324 --> 01:23:41,553
I don't know..

930
01:23:47,809 --> 01:23:49,870
probably...

931
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:52,183
yes.

932
01:23:58,414 --> 01:24:00,883
But he wasn't white. He was black.

933
01:24:01,999 --> 01:24:05,184
And every time I looked at you I'd been seeing him

934
01:24:10,139 --> 01:24:13,636
Do you see him now?

935
01:24:13,836 --> 01:24:16,228
No. I see you

936
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:19,981
I see my daughter.

937
01:24:20,181 --> 01:24:23,032
I see my daughter Barbara Ann.

938
01:24:23,232 --> 01:24:28,220
All I ever wanted for you
was what I thought was best.

939
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:31,005
I had a dream for you.

940
01:24:31,205 --> 01:24:34,647
A dream where you would be with people
who could look into your heart.

941
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:43,561
people who could show you a
way to walk in this world with pride and courage

942
01:24:43,761 --> 01:24:47,500
you weren't gonna get any of that from me

943
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:49,317
I didn't have any courage.

944
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:52,840
I was so afraid.

945
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:55,490
Afraid of what?

946
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:03,239
you

947
01:25:05,599 --> 01:25:07,984
I was afraid you hate me

948
01:25:08,442 --> 01:25:10,644
Oh God, forgive me.

949
01:25:13,512 --> 01:25:16,938
I never even went looking for you
when you were grown

950
01:25:21,329 --> 01:25:22,618
why?

951
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:29,929
I said

952
01:25:30,830 --> 01:25:33,820
"they'll be looking at her skin"

953
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:37,035
"they'll be looking at her skin"

954
01:25:40,772 --> 01:25:44,110
And all the time it was me who was looking at your skin

955
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:49,220
All I saw was the color, I never saw you.

956
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:59,449
I'm so sorry, Barbara.
I'm so sorry.

957
01:26:05,766 --> 01:26:07,657
Mom.

958
01:26:07,857 --> 01:26:09,638
My baby.

959
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:25,930
I saved this,
something you made for Barbara

960
01:26:29,079 --> 01:26:32,277
Thank you for taking such good care of my daughter

961
01:26:32,477 --> 01:26:33,447
You're welcome.

962
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,989
Call your moms, see what they do!

963
01:26:37,189 --> 01:26:40,199
Hey mom!
