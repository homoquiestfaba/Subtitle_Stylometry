1
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,728
- Good morning, Emnet.
- Good morning.

2
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,526
Good morning, Mrs...

3
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:07,827
Belaynesh.

4
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,095
Come into my office.

5
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:30,220
What can I do for you,
Mrs Belaynesh?

6
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:34,783
I heard that you...

7
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,899
It's ok.

8
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,468
He has always
been an angry man,

9
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,214
but he didn't drink
so much before.

10
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,278
Now all he does is drink.

11
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,157
When he comes home,
he'll find any reason to hit me.

12
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,154
I went to some family members.

13
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,224
They said, "He hits you
because he loves you.

14
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:19,670
"Your husband is a kind man.
Go back to your house. "

15
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:27,206
Why don't you give me your address
and phone number? I'll talk to him.

16
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,079
We don't have a phone.

17
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,947
Where do you live?

18
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,120
His name is Zenebe.

19
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:43,184
He works at a construction site
next to St Gabriel church.

20
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,298
If he finds out I came
to talk to you,

21
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,492
- he will kill me...
- Don't worry, Mrs Belaynesh.

22
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:52,197
There are laws in this country.
No one is above the law.

23
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,797
Hirut!

24
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,335
You've missed one question.

25
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,945
It asks for the distance,
not the time.

26
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:41,043
If Abebe takes 60 minutes
to run 12 kilometres,

27
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,521
and 20 minutes to
run four kilometres,

28
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,115
how far would he run
in 120 minutes?

29
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,358
The correct answer
is 24 kilometres.

30
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,061
The rest is good.

31
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:04,937
I'm putting in a recommendation
to promote you to fifth grade.

32
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,167
Please let me go!

33
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,177
Mama!

34
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,948
Please let me go!
Please!

35
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,453
Let me out!

36
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,856
Mama!

37
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,310
Excuse me, I'm looking...

38
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,816
for Mr Zenebe, please.

39
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,647
I'm Zenebe.

40
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,980
You are Mr Zenebe?

41
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,504
Mrs Belaynesh's husband?

42
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,919
- How do you know my wife?
- Mr Zenebe, is that your girlfriend?

43
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,799
I'm here to let you know,

44
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,391
that if you ever touch your wife
again I'll have you arrested.

45
00:07:53,426 --> 00:07:55,434
Listen, you little shit,
I'm old enough to be your father.

46
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,975
And man enough to
beat your wife, right?

47
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:04,615
You want to keep your job,
be nice to your wife.

48
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,215
Take this.

49
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,013
It's coffee.

50
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,388
Don't worry.

51
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,434
You will soon be my wife.

52
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,268
Tadele!

53
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,069
What is it?

54
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:13,376
It's nothing. I thought I saw
people coming this way.

55
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,181
Have some coffee.

56
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,193
The girl is strong.

57
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,290
She almost tipped
me off the horse.

58
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,268
But she's good-looking.

59
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,669
- That's true.
- Good genes.

60
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,715
She got away!

61
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,219
There she is.
Get her.

62
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,897
Don't come any closer!

63
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,912
Don't come any closer.
I'm not going to tell you again.

64
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,913
Get her.

65
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:09,488
- Cut her throat!
- No, let me go! Mama!

66
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,426
Stop. Get off the girl.
Get off!

67
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,026
She just killed a man.
She should be killed.

68
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,765
You know the rules.

69
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,209
We are civilian police,
chosen by the people of this village.

70
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,436
We're taking the
girl to the police.

71
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,737
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

72
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:44,390
They are holding a young girl
at a police station in the village.

73
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,930
They say she killed her abductor.

74
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:49,627
They are going to kill the poor girl.
Did you call our regional office there?

75
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,068
No, I just heard
this on the radio.

76
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,645
Hello, Etaferaw, it's Meaza.

77
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:06,107
Did you hear anything about a young girl
who's being held at the police station?

78
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:09,710
Can you go there and find out about it,
please? Thank you.

79
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,110
- Are you all together?
- No, we're not.

80
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,376
We are here for Hirut.

81
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,644
- Do you have food?
- Yes.

82
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,186
- Yes, we do.
- Bring it here.

83
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,720
Open it.

84
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,499
- Open it.
- Ok.

85
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:19,554
- Eat it.
- Sorry, but we brought it for Hirut.

86
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,149
I understand.

87
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:26,989
You have to eat it so I know
you didn't put poison in there.

88
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,330
It's policy.

89
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,233
In the name of God, poison?

90
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,833
Hold this.

91
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,165
Follow me.

92
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,834
You wait here.

93
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,869
Welcome.

94
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,136
How are you?

95
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,413
Here is the girl's file.

96
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:52,006
Her name is Hirut Assefa.
She's 14.

97
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,075
What do you mean, she's 14?

98
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,518
She's 14 years old?

99
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,613
And she killed a man?

100
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,249
That's what the
police report says.

101
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,854
She's being held without bail
and with limited visitation.

102
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,276
- We are here to see Hirut.
- What are you to her?

103
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,040
We are her lawyers.

104
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,627
She doesn't need lawyers.

105
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,722
She knows what she did.

106
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,962
She killed a man and she's
going to pay for it with her life.

107
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,094
That's not for you to decide.

108
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,370
Teshome!

109
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,587
Take her to the little girl.

110
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,919
Don't think that you can
save this girl's life.

111
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,247
How are you doing, Hirut?

112
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,819
My name is Meaza Ashenafi,

113
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,350
and this is Etaferaw Teshager.

114
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,462
We are lawyers.

115
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,057
Do you know what
a lawyer is?

116
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,697
No.

117
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,842
Why are you angry?

118
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:12,490
It's ok.
We are not the police.

119
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,694
All I wanted was to get
back to my parents.

120
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:29,973
It's going to be ok.
I'll take you to a hospital.

121
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,309
I'm coming back to get you.

122
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,677
I'm here to represent
Hirut Assefa.

123
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,210
She needs medical attention.

124
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,617
And, on behalf of Andinet
Women Lawyers Association,

125
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,087
I would like to post bail
and take her to hospital.

126
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,060
You know I can't do what
you're asking me to do.

127
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,358
She is in for murder.

128
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,731
Besides, you are not authorised
to represent her in this region.

129
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,198
She is 14 years old, sir,
and she has a broken arm.

130
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,643
She might have other injuries
that we don't know about.

131
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,237
And we do have a representative
in this region.

132
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,221
The Assistant DA thinks that
she's lying about her age.

133
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,960
He thinks she is much
older than that.

134
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,364
Besides, I just can't let
you take her without

135
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,029
her parents' permission,
since she's 14.

136
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,402
Come in.

137
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,573
Sir, we are all ready.

138
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,111
I'm sorry.

139
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,017
Good afternoon.

140
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,054
- Are you Hirut's mother?
- Yes, I am.

141
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,000
I don't think I remember
who you are.

142
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,135
You wouldn't know me, ma'am.

143
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:41,036
We came to talk to you about Hirut,
if that's ok.

144
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,870
Well, don't stand in the sun.
Come inside.

145
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,582
Aregash, light the lantern.

146
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,352
Please don't bother.

147
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,026
We are comfortable.

148
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:19,176
It's been hard since
they took Hirut.

149
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,940
I don't have anyone to talk to.

150
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:27,344
I don't know where to go.

151
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:33,255
We help women
and girls like Hirut,

152
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:37,889
who are in legal trouble and don't get
proper professional representation.

153
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,055
But we don't have
anything to pay you.

154
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,627
We are poor farmers,
as you can see.

155
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,331
Money is not necessary.
Our service is free.

156
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,870
It's her father's fault.

157
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,572
He insisted that she
should go to school.

158
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,611
All of this wouldn't have happened
if she had stayed at home

159
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,312
and helped her parents,
like I did when I was a little girl.

160
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,321
I think you are mistaken.

161
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:08,226
Your husband did
the right thing.

162
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:16,327
What I need is your permission
to represent Hirut legally.

163
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,300
It's ok by me.

164
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:23,841
But it's her father who makes decisions
around here. You have to talk to him.

165
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,467
- Where is your husband?
- He's out in the field, farming.

166
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,707
Excuse me, I've got to get
more wood from the back.

167
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,947
Hirut is never coming home, is she?

168
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,719
Meseret never came back.

169
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,526
- Who is Meseret?
- She's my sister.

170
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,497
She's been gone a long time.

171
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,592
- Aregash.
- Yes.

172
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,213
They are lawyers.
They came to help us.

173
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:05,681
Help us with what?

174
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,547
My name is Meaza.

175
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,922
This is Etaferaw.

176
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,086
If you want your
daughter back...

177
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:20,495
I strongly suggest that
you sign this paper.

178
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:28,235
Is this going to start a war
with his family?

179
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:31,184
Ato Assefa,
your daughter is hurt.

180
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,059
She has been raped.

181
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:37,505
For all I know,
she might get pregnant.

182
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,810
So what do you want
me to do now?

183
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,582
All you have to do
is sign this paper.

184
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,253
I don't know how
to read or write.

185
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,350
Let me help you.

186
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,800
This paper shows that you
gave us your permission

187
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,496
to represent your daughter
in a court of law.

188
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,070
Give me your finger.

189
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,017
I just want to ask you
one more question.

190
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,217
How old is Hirut?

191
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,591
She is a kid.

192
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:27,130
Her little sister was born

193
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:31,295
on the day of St Mary in the
year that I lost my mother.

194
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,631
And my mother's ten-year anniversary
was two years ago.

195
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:38,676
That makes her 12.

196
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,370
So Hirut is 14.

197
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,811
She's 14.

198
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:47,183
I need to be sure that she's 14.

199
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,371
Because the police
think that she's older.

200
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:55,621
You can ask the church.
All my daughters are baptised.

201
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:59,328
Thank you very much for everything.
We should be going.

202
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:03,060
You can't leave without
eating lunch. That's rude.

203
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,845
I'm sorry.
I wasn't trying to be rude.

204
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,464
We just have to get back
to the police station.

205
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:13,010
That is not acceptable. You must not
forget your culture. This is our tradition.

206
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,444
Come now,
come into the house.

207
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,281
The father's signature,

208
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,991
the regional work permit,

209
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,045
and a baptism record
from a church

210
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,027
showing when Hirut and
her sisters were baptised.

211
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,498
According to that record,
she is 14.

212
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:50,414
If it's ok, we'd like to take
Hirut to the hospital now.

213
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,007
It's not going to
be that easy.

214
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,748
I'm the Assistant DA
for the region.

215
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,617
Meaza Ashenafi, Andinet.

216
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,824
- What is your name?
- Gizaw.

217
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,652
This is Etaferaw Teshager,
Andinet.

218
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,905
The police report shows
that she shot him

219
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,800
with his own rifle a day
after her abduction.

220
00:26:08,994 --> 00:26:10,933
Does the police report also show
that she was raped,

221
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,094
beaten up badly and might
have a broken arm?

222
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,471
Are you telling me that
she's 14 years old?

223
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,339
But what I don't understand is,

224
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,743
where did she learn to use a
semi-automatic machine gun?

225
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:25,646
And how did she run with a gun that
probably weighs as much as she does?

226
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,652
I don't know, but nearly
every farmer owns one,

227
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,382
so it couldn't have been
completely foreign.

228
00:26:32,146 --> 00:26:34,825
And every girl carries
a much heavier burden,

229
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:38,421
than a rifle around here.

230
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:42,091
Do you have children,
Ato Gizaw?

231
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,863
Are your children baptised?

232
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,564
You know that baptism records
are not credible.

233
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:52,541
We need proof. Hard evidence,
like a birth certificate.

234
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,135
Are you kidding me?

235
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:57,612
Since when have poor farmers
been getting birth certificates?

236
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,207
They don't even
get vaccinations.

237
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,220
I'd be careful what I say,
if I were you.

238
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:07,281
It's an unfounded accusation to say
that the state is not doing its job.

239
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,916
You know that is
not what I'm saying.

240
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:12,519
And I won't be that easily intimidated,
if that's what you're getting at.

241
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,728
You have seen my documentation.

242
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:20,026
- The girl is underage.
- We don't know that yet.

243
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,629
What do you propose we
should do to verify that?

244
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,505
She will be sent to a government
hospital to determine her age.

245
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,375
What hospital?
Where?

246
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:32,439
You know there isn't a specialist or a
hospital that can do that in this country.

247
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,528
You are holding a little girl in your
jail cell who needs medical attention.

248
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,582
All I'm asking you is to let
me take her to hospital.

249
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,025
Excuse me, I must go to court.

250
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:08,581
I think we should invite Hirut's
parents tomorrow morning.

251
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,484
I think you're right.

252
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,792
Meaza, come in!

253
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,310
You've grown thin.
Are you eating enough?

254
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,315
Enough to survive.

255
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,011
- I'm hungry! Let's eat?
- Ok.

256
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,448
How is work?

257
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,685
I have to say, it's different
from working for you.

258
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:51,888
You didn't work for me. You worked for
the Transitional Government of Ethiopia.

259
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:55,126
I just happened
to be your boss.

260
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:10,537
I have a favour to ask.

261
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,707
Is there anybody that
you can talk to?

262
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:19,279
They aren't letting me take the
little girl to hospital. She's hurt.

263
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:23,054
- Let me see what I can do.
- Thank you.

264
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:27,120
So, how is your guy?
Does he call?

265
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:30,656
Yes, he does. But, he doesn't
want to move to Addis Abeba.

266
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:34,771
He'll change his mind.

267
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:38,866
You'll see. You two will be married
and live happily ever after.

268
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:42,874
Well, you didn't get married. So you
aren't qualified to advise in that regard.

269
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,073
But of course.

270
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:49,779
I've been happily married to
the law for 45 years.

271
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,305
Hello, Alemu?

272
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,714
Can you come with the reporters
tomorrow morning?

273
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,537
To the village police station.

274
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,013
Do you think you
can get her out?

275
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,749
- How did they hear about this?
- I don't know.

276
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,061
Let's go inside.

277
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,896
Meaza, do you think Hirut is
going to be released today?

278
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,853
Is that it, or are we expecting
any more people?

279
00:31:03,882 --> 00:31:05,387
This is Hirut's family.

280
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:09,624
Her mother and father,
her younger sister Aregash,

281
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,828
her older sister Meseret,
and Meseret's children.

282
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:15,895
This is Dr Tamrat. He is the region's
chief medical investigator.

283
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,943
He is here to help us determine
the girl's true age.

284
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,880
I have examined the prisoner.

285
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:27,281
And it is truly obvious that the prisoner
is well into her late teenage years.

286
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,821
We can see that without the help
of any scientific evidence.

287
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,880
The girl is well developed.

288
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:38,088
With all due respect, Dr Tamrat, it is
really insulting to call her "the prisoner".

289
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,187
Her name is Hirut.

290
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,129
It is also insulting to
Hirut and her family

291
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,796
that you think she's older than she is
because she has developed breasts.

292
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:58,077
Look at her younger sister.
She's only 12.

293
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:01,614
Ms Meaza, the priso...

294
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,780
Hirut is 18 years of age or
in the vicinity of that age.

295
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,324
Yes, sir, he is.

296
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,758
Gizaw, it's for you.

297
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,698
This is Gizaw.
Yes.

298
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:35,879
I understand, sir.

299
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,546
Very well.

300
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:50,561
Can you ask your clients to wait for you
outside, so we can talk in private?

301
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:14,558
I've been instructed to release the
prisoner to Andinet after you post bail.

302
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:18,493
From here on, all communications
will be through your office.

303
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,191
And Andinet is responsible
for making sure

304
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,599
that the prisoner appears
at all of her appointments.

305
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,831
Thank you.

306
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:32,103
We would like to have all communications
handled through our office here.

307
00:33:56,801 --> 00:34:00,355
Meaza, how do you feel now
that Hirut is released?

308
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,086
Is Hirut free?

309
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,704
Does this mean she
didn't kill the man?

310
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:14,080
Hirut is out on bail. At the moment,
we are taking her to hospital.

311
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,087
She is going to be represented by
Andinet Women Lawyers Association.

312
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:21,854
Our regional office and Etaferaw
Teshager will lead the defence.

313
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,826
- What is she charged with?
- Hirut is charged with murder.

314
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,659
We have requested
the full police report,

315
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,969
and we will appear in court
to defend these charges.

316
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,365
Thank you.

317
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,532
I'm Alemu,
you called me last night.

318
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,668
You promised to talk to me.

319
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,601
Good morning!

320
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,373
Praise God.

321
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:54,450
I think everyone concerned
with this matter is here.

322
00:35:56,387 --> 00:36:01,304
The reason for this
gathering is to discuss Hirut

323
00:36:01,724 --> 00:36:04,093
and the man she killed.

324
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:07,612
If there are no objections, we'd like
to go forward with the hearing.

325
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:11,967
First, Tadele's father,
what do you say to this gathering?

326
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:22,104
I stand before you today
as a childless father.

327
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,642
I am fruitful,
thanks to the Lord.

328
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,382
But a fruit of my life has been
taken away from me unjustly

329
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:34,754
- by a girl that he wanted to marry.
- That's true.

330
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:37,953
My son's wish was
to get married.

331
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,228
Following his tradition,
he abducted her.

332
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,364
Only to find that the girl I thought
would be my daughter-in-law

333
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:49,600
became the cause
of my misery.

334
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,504
That's true.

335
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:55,771
Abducting for marriage
is our tradition.

336
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:58,940
It's not only here.
The highlanders in the north do it.

337
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,064
The southerners in
Hawassa do it.

338
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:05,350
Hell, I abducted my wife.

339
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:10,621
But she knew better,
she didn't go for my rifle.

340
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:17,292
I say it is her teacher's fault.

341
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:23,369
Bad parenting too, of course.

342
00:37:23,404 --> 00:37:27,474
But it is these city people with
their ties and jackets and books

343
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,342
who are ruining our tradition.

344
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,345
Is this what you teach
our daughters?

345
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,578
To disobey men?

346
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:38,280
Not to respect our fathers?

347
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:41,120
Or do you teach them
to kill their husbands?

348
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:45,856
We teach your children to read and write,
so they can help you better.

349
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:50,128
You must have forgotten, Alemayehu,
I was also brought up here.

350
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:56,033
I went to the city to learn,
so one day I could help my village.

351
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,042
Well, look how you turned out.

352
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,242
You aren't even married.

353
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:05,042
Yet you're older than my son,
who's already got two children.

354
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:09,052
Order.
Order.

355
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:15,385
Now, the girl's father,
what do you say to us?

356
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,794
The good Lord honoured me
with three girls.

357
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:24,261
They are not boys,
but they are good girls.

358
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:27,030
My oldest daughter
got abducted.

359
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:29,165
She loved running.

360
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,834
She ran like the wind.

361
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:34,878
Won all kinds of medals, too.

362
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:37,140
But she got abducted.

363
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,615
I let her go for fear
of bloodshed.

364
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:44,882
Now she lives with a drunk
and four children.

365
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,622
But Hirut,
she is a difficult girl.

366
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:53,527
Stubborn.
She has always been.

367
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:57,624
She almost killed her
mother at birth.

368
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,927
All she wanted to do
was to go to school,

369
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,805
so one day she could go to
the university in the city.

370
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:09,369
She didn't want to end
up like her sister.

371
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:14,077
When his son came and
asked me for Hirut's hand,

372
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:16,585
I told him, "She is just a girl.
She is not ready. "

373
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:21,250
But that didn't matter, his son had
decided to abduct her all along.

374
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:25,860
She did what she did
to come home to me.

375
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:30,190
It was his son's fault for
taking her against her will.

376
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,293
Your daughter is too good
for my son? Huh?

377
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,875
Stop!
Please stop!

378
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:47,611
Please, this is not a duel.

379
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:53,086
We are here to resolve
a grave matter.

380
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,416
Isn't it?

381
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,358
- It is.
- It's true.

382
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:03,593
Tadele's father, what do
you want from this court?

383
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,890
I'm an old man.

384
00:40:09,786 --> 00:40:14,192
I don't have many days
left for me out on the farm.

385
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:17,977
My son was the future
of my family.

386
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,149
But he is dead now.

387
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:22,310
So, as it is with our tradition,

388
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:26,186
the girl must be killed immediately
and be buried with the man she killed.

389
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,555
Yes.
That's right.

390
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,524
If this court fails
to do that,

391
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:34,839
I'll take matters into
my own hands,

392
00:40:35,104 --> 00:40:37,807
and swear vengeance
on her family.

393
00:40:37,842 --> 00:40:40,627
That's correct.
That should be the decision.

394
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,933
Yes!

395
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:55,216
This is very unusual.

396
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:59,233
Since the girl is in
police custody,

397
00:40:59,594 --> 00:41:02,899
it makes the matter
a difficult one to judge.

398
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:07,156
Also, since the person in
question is but a little girl,

399
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,529
it makes the case
unusual and hard.

400
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,507
So we have decided
the girl's father

401
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:17,292
will pay the sum
of 3,000 Birr,

402
00:41:17,327 --> 00:41:22,439
or the equivalent in livestock,
in compensation for the bloodshed.

403
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:28,542
As for the girl, she is to be exiled
to a place far away from this village.

404
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:34,515
We hope that this judgement

405
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:40,363
will ease the burden felt
by the deceased's family.

406
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:44,740
This is not fair. She must die.
No. It's not right!

407
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:48,872
Our decision is final and
not open to negotiation.

408
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:50,907
We are done with
our work here.

409
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,622
You'll stay here with me
until you feel better.

410
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,524
Then we'll find a place
for you to stay.

411
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,153
Let me show you
around the house.

412
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,569
Here is the bathroom,

413
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,409
if you want to wash,

414
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:29,002
and, you know, go pee.

415
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,550
And this is the kitchen.

416
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,682
I cook my food here.

417
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:45,091
And this is a refrigerator,
I keep my food here.

418
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,358
You're hungry.

419
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,623
I'll make us something.

420
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,676
Go ahead and sit down.

421
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,272
Eat.

422
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:41,851
Why don't you
have a husband?

423
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,446
I don't know.

424
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,923
My mother always
asks that question.

425
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,490
Are you a bad woman?

426
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,565
Because in the village,
when a girl is married,

427
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:03,129
if she is not a virgin, the husband
throws her out of his house.

428
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,573
She can't even get
back to her family.

429
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:11,942
They say she disgraced the family
and she's forced to live by herself.

430
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:19,249
- Did you disgrace your family?
- No.

431
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,689
I didn't disgrace my family.

432
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:31,167
You see, when I was a little girl,
I grew up in a village just like yours.

433
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:36,604
I have five brothers and
I am the only girl.

434
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,541
My mother made sure I was raised
equally with my brothers.

435
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:43,340
So I went to school
with them every day.

436
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,513
And I knew I didn't want to
get married and have children

437
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,482
like everybody else
in the village, either.

438
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:55,288
Men kept asking my father
to give me to their sons.

439
00:44:56,193 --> 00:45:00,823
He told them that I was a difficult child.
Not wife material.

440
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,492
Of course, he was lying.

441
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:10,300
So they didn't try to abduct you
after your father refused?

442
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:13,366
I guess I was lucky that
I had a lot of brothers.

443
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:16,913
No one dared to bother me because
my brothers were always there.

444
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:22,316
And after high school, I moved to the city
and I was accepted into the university.

445
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,036
Do you wish you
were married?

446
00:45:30,071 --> 00:45:31,439
No.

447
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:34,292
I think about it sometimes,
though.

448
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:38,533
But I'm always working.

449
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:43,470
I think men are afraid to marry me
because I don't always stay at home.

450
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,911
I'm not a virgin any more.

451
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,254
What's going to
happen to me?

452
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,388
You are a brave girl.

453
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,989
What you did was self-defence.

454
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:18,564
It's ok.

455
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,609
Stop crying.

456
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,181
Let me see you.

457
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,046
You are a beautiful girl.

458
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:37,489
Now let's go to bed.

459
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:40,655
We have to go to court
first thing in the morning.

460
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,255
Get up.

461
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:56,971
Sit down.

462
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,761
Go ahead and sleep.

463
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:25,831
In October 1996,

464
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:32,404
while the defendant was
walking home from school,

465
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,418
the deceased,

466
00:48:34,429 --> 00:48:38,673
Tadele Kebede, and six
other men abducted her.

467
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:43,680
Then Tadele took her virginity
by force the same night.

468
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:49,192
In order to save her life,
she shot and killed him.

469
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:53,724
This is the defendant's statement.

470
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:02,872
Your witness,
defence counsellor.

471
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:12,209
Your Honour, due to the
unusual nature of this case,

472
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:16,981
no one in this community is
willing to testify on her behalf.

473
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:21,383
So we ask the court
for a six-month

474
00:49:21,446 --> 00:49:25,808
extension to interview
potential witnesses.

475
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,795
Your Honour,

476
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:34,360
the defence knows that no witness
will come forward on her behalf

477
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:40,062
because she killed
a man in cold blood.

478
00:49:40,097 --> 00:49:44,870
The defence is deliberately trying
to delay the court proceedings.

479
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:49,885
Only the court can delay or
expedite the court proceedings.

480
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:01,791
Therefore, I'm giving
you three months.

481
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,137
Excuse me.

482
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:17,212
I know you don't like me.

483
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,872
But this is not about me.

484
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:20,883
A young girl's life
is on the line.

485
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,145
You know that no witness is going
to come forward for Hirut.

486
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:29,085
The entire village is against her.
They want her dead.

487
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,753
You know she shot
him in self-defence.

488
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:34,763
If you don't have witnesses,
I can't help you.

489
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:37,095
All I know is that she
shot and killed a man.

490
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,431
There is no evidence
that shows otherwise.

491
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:42,737
Are you asking
me for a favour?

492
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:45,775
Yes, the villagers
want her dead.

493
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:48,208
Do you want me to
spare her life?

494
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:51,747
She's looking at life in prison.
It's your decision.

495
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,609
How do you do, ma'am?

496
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,908
- How do you do?
- Praise God.

497
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,951
Where can I find Alemayehu?

498
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,388
Do you know each other?
Are you related?

499
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:36,152
Oh, no.
I just...

500
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:40,595
I'm helping a young girl
from the next village

501
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:44,358
and I can't seem to find anyone
who wants to help her.

502
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,403
Are you the woman that they
talk about on the radio?

503
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:51,201
God bless you for what you
are doing for the young girl.

504
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,969
That's his house.

505
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:54,771
Ok.
Thank you.

506
00:51:56,513 --> 00:52:01,473
You shouldn't go around advertising
that you are helping that girl.

507
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,644
That would not
be useful for you.

508
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:29,738
Excuse me.

509
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:41,450
My name is Meaza Ashenafi
and I'm a lawyer.

510
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:44,152
I know who you are.

511
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:47,196
You were there when Tadele
abducted Hirut, weren't you?

512
00:52:47,952 --> 00:52:49,319
I was.

513
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,131
As his best man,
it's my job to help him.

514
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:55,261
I know I can't convince you
to testify in court.

515
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:58,931
Why are you trying to defend
a girl who murdered a man?

516
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,637
Because she was trying
to defend herself.

517
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:04,106
By taking his rifle
and shooting him?

518
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:07,344
She was running away from him
to get back to her parents.

519
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:08,883
He was trying to marry her.

520
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:13,888
I know you folks in the city don't approve
of our methods, but this is our tradition.

521
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,816
But don't you think it's wrong to
force a girl to have your children

522
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,417
even though she
doesn't love you?

523
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,793
Men abduct when
they fall in love.

524
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:24,061
And Tadele got angry when her family
told him that she didn't want him.

525
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:26,761
Even though his family had
arranged another wife for him,

526
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,360
he didn't want to miss
out on Hirut.

527
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:34,302
So, what do you think
should happen to Hirut?

528
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:38,414
The only punishment
fit for her is death.

529
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,949
And that is what will happen to
her if she ever comes back.

530
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:43,131
What's taking so long
with that wood?

531
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:50,121
I'm sorry, I didn't know
that we had a guest.

532
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,156
I'll prepare lunch.

533
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:55,919
It's ok.
She's just leaving.

534
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:00,136
Thank you for
speaking to me.

535
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:12,048
Good morning, Emnet.
Sorry I'm late. My car...

536
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,344
Mrs Belaynesh, is everything ok?

537
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,784
Everything's ok,
I'm just here to bring you this.

538
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:21,892
Mrs Belaynesh, you shouldn't have.
This isn't necessary.

539
00:54:21,927 --> 00:54:26,191
It's ok, it didn't cost me anything.
I baked it myself.

540
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:28,827
Thank you.

541
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:33,062
I should be thanking you. Because
of you, I've got my husband back.

542
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:34,636
Thank you.

543
00:54:35,177 --> 00:54:37,256
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

544
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,403
I'm in a jam.

545
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:18,194
I have a young girl living
in my house because

546
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:21,665
they want to kill her in her village.
And the police can't protect her.

547
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:24,377
Is this the girl who
killed her abductor?

548
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:28,042
Can you help her in
your orphanage?

549
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,446
You know I can't.

550
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:35,619
She has living parents.

551
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:38,321
We take girls without
living parents or relatives.

552
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:43,059
I know that, but this girl cannot
go back to her parents.

553
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:45,498
The dead man's family
has sworn to kill her.

554
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,881
Please, it's just going to be
for a little while.

555
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:52,172
She needs to be protected
while she's on trial.

556
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,341
I'll talk to the board.

557
00:57:00,806 --> 00:57:02,225
Thanks.

558
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:08,691
Oh, one more thing.
No one should know where she is.

559
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,783
As far as I'm concerned,
she's still in danger.

560
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:08,697
This is Mrs Elfinesh, the administrator.
You know Meaza.

561
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:10,980
- How do you do, Mrs Elfinesh?
- Hi, Meaza.

562
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:13,055
I haven't seen you for a while.

563
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:16,114
And this is Hirut Assefa,
our newest member.

564
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:20,094
You are a very courageous girl.
No need to be shy.

565
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,364
We're all friends here.

566
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,366
Are you hungry?

567
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:31,563
Meaza is going to join us too.

568
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,236
Come.

569
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:43,979
Where did you find her?

570
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:46,681
The police found her as she
was running away from home.

571
00:58:46,988 --> 00:58:48,193
Amazing!

572
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,398
Quiet, please, girls.

573
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,001
Please, quiet.

574
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:07,600
This is Hirut Assefa, the newest
member of our family.

575
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:11,609
And what do we
say to our sister?

576
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:15,295
Welcome to Addis Tesfa, Hirut!

577
00:59:16,028 --> 00:59:17,883
Very good!

578
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,735
Hirut, do you want
to sit with us?

579
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:50,918
Go ahead and eat.

580
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,297
Is this a school?

581
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:10,417
Yes, it's a school.
But it's our home too.

582
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:27,484
I heard that the villagers
exiled Hirut.

583
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:30,492
Is it true?

584
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:45,207
That's why I'm here.

585
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:48,905
I want to ask your advice.
I asked the Assistant DA

586
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:51,746
to convince the elders to reverse
their decision, but he has refused.

587
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:56,844
I asked the Ministry of Justice
to do something about it.

588
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:59,786
They said, "We don't get mixed up
with the customary law. "

589
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:03,049
So I'm prepared to challenge the
Ministry of Justice in the High Court.

590
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:05,287
Well, that's a serious step.

591
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:10,856
You'll have a hard time convincing
any judge to take your case.

592
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:14,699
They will be terrified to summon
the minister to court.

593
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:16,553
The law needs to be enforced.

594
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:18,900
They can't forbid her to
go home to her parents.

595
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,408
It's a violation of her freedom.

596
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:22,910
Look, Meaza, these cases
are hard to deal with.

597
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:28,891
There's never been a self-defence
case awarded to a woman.

598
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,312
Remember the recent ruling?

599
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:33,685
A judge ordered a young girl
to marry her abductor

600
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:35,621
because she is pregnant
with his child,

601
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,786
even though neither the girl nor her
parents agreed to the marriage.

602
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:43,483
You're right,
the law must be enforced.

603
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,601
But there are different
ways when

604
01:01:47,216 --> 01:01:50,121
you're dealing with
government officials.

605
01:01:50,156 --> 01:01:53,375
It's late, I have to get
back to the office.

606
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:37,485
- I can't file this case.
- Why?

607
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,251
You want to sue the
Minister of Justice?

608
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,618
You can read, right?

609
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,061
No judge will take this case.

610
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:13,641
What's the matter?

611
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:17,042
Why are you crying?

612
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:23,012
What's the matter, honey?
Did you have a nightmare?

613
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,053
What happened to her?
Did she fall down?

614
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:27,588
She didn't fall down,
she always sleeps on the floor.

615
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:29,090
What?

616
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:32,126
I want to go home.

617
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,029
Please take me home.

618
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,860
Poor girl.

619
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,867
She misses her mum.

620
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,297
It's ok, it's going
to be all right.

621
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:49,775
It's ok.
Stop crying.

622
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:22,107
- What's wrong, Hirut?
- I want to go home.

623
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:24,975
- You know we can't go back yet.
- Why not?

624
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:26,784
Because it's dangerous.

625
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:29,350
No.
I want to go home.

626
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:32,581
Listen to me, Hirut. I know you miss
your parents and your sister.

627
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:35,681
You don't know anything.
Why am I here?

628
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,651
You say you're helping me,
but you're using me for your own good.

629
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:42,458
I know what's going on.
I listen to the radio.

630
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:45,728
Hirut, please.
This is not like you.

631
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:48,634
I don't want to live here.
I want to be with my sister.

632
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:52,674
Yes, but we have to wait
until the court date.

633
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:55,734
You can see her there,
where we have protection.

634
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:59,907
- You don't understand.
- Believe me, I do understand.

635
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:06,515
I found it on her bed.
It's from her sister.

636
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:08,783
Her father pulled
her out of school.

637
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,680
- Hirut!
- Aregash!

638
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:14,015
Oh my God, Hirut,
is it really you?

639
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:26,126
- Mr Assefa, how are you?
- Is everything all right?

640
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:27,829
Yes.

641
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:31,236
- Please come in, Meaza.
- Ok, thank you.

642
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:42,817
You have grown so much.

643
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:46,980
What's it like in the city?

644
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:49,149
There are too many people.

645
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:52,422
It's loud.
The cars, the music.

646
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:56,062
I'm not allowed to leave
the orphanage that much.

647
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,293
I just go to school
and come back.

648
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:02,435
I'd love to come visit you.

649
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:12,803
- Hirut is here.
- What did you say? Where?

650
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:16,876
- Speak up, where did you see her?
- She came in a car.

651
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:19,045
There's a woman with her.

652
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,919
You should be getting back.
It's getting late.

653
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:25,861
Mr Assefa, can I talk
to you for a second?

654
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:28,419
Please don't leave yet.
The food is almost ready.

655
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,021
It's getting late.

656
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:45,705
Why isn't Aregash
going to school?

657
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,507
I know you need help
at home, but...

658
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:53,418
It would destroy her mother
if anything happened to her.

659
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:57,118
Besides, I need someone
to watch the cattle.

660
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:02,991
- You have to go back.
- Father, please.

661
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:05,566
You must think about your mother,
and your sister too.

662
01:10:05,634 --> 01:10:09,126
If they know you're here, it's not
going to be good for any of us.

663
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:13,301
We have to go.

664
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:29,420
- No! No... No. Aregash!
- What is it?

665
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:36,124
Hirut, get down!

666
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:18,970
You can stay with
me if you want.

667
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:27,238
It's all my fault.

668
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:30,216
None of this would've happened
if I hadn't run away.

669
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,055
Aregash would still
be in school.

670
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:37,158
None of it is your fault.

671
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:45,256
You know, I was once arrested
when I was your age.

672
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:49,400
It's true. It was during the
military government time.

673
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:52,963
13 of us were sent to a
resettlement camp to teach.

674
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:56,340
11 boys and two girls.

675
01:11:56,412 --> 01:12:00,542
So, as always, the two of us girls
were supposed to cook.

676
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,049
I refused.

677
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:04,483
I was there to teach, I thought.

678
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:07,612
Then the girl accused me of not
doing my part as a woman,

679
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:10,692
and I was arrested and put in
a holding cell for two weeks.

680
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:12,693
How did you get out?

681
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:15,787
They knew I wasn't going to change
my mind. So they let me out.

682
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:21,060
They wouldn't have liked
my cooking anyway.

683
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:24,587
- Why? - Because I didn't
know how to cook.

684
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,165
I still don't.

685
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:31,202
But I didn't tell them that.

686
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:34,238
They wouldn't have believed me.

687
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:49,360
You sure you want
to get out here?

688
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,427
Yes.

689
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:15,023
Hello, Andinet.
Thank you.

690
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:17,284
Yes, I'll tell her.

691
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:22,893
Hello.

692
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:24,933
- Hello Andinet.
- What's going on?

693
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,025
Thank you for your support.
We appreciate that.

694
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:28,797
ANDINET SUES THE
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

695
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:37,644
"Andinet Women Lawyers Association,
a local non-profit organisation... "

696
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:38,805
Do you believe this?

697
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:42,281
"... that provides free legal aid to
women who are victims of violence

698
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:44,511
"sued the Minister
of Justice today.

699
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:49,023
"The charges were filed after the
ministry refused to overturn

700
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:52,026
"the customary court's decision

701
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:56,296
"to exile
14-year-old Hirut Assefa

702
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,314
from her village. "

703
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:03,933
- Should I continue? There's more.
- Membere, we had to fight back.

704
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:06,906
What do you think the minister
is going to do now?

705
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:10,137
We can't risk it all
because of one girl.

706
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:14,171
Don't you get it? Hirut is what
we've been waiting for.

707
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:18,117
We had a good chance of convincing a
judge and getting the decision reversed.

708
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:23,791
But you had to go and sue
the Minister of Justice.

709
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,960
You know why I stayed here?

710
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:33,023
When I could work for any NGO
and make much more than cab fare?

711
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:35,092
- Meaza.
- Wait a second.

712
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:41,702
Because I thought I was
part of something bigger.

713
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:49,409
I stood by you while being
treated like a stepchild

714
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:52,728
by the media and
everybody else.

715
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,392
I am your partner.

716
01:14:57,459 --> 01:15:02,260
My husband stays at home with
the kids while I'm here with you.

717
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:03,992
For what?

718
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:12,801
For Andinet or violence against
women to have any significance,

719
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:14,068
we must win this case.

720
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:17,441
If that doesn't happen, we're done.
Hirut's case can really start something.

721
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,208
But this is not
just about her.

722
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:24,081
We could lose everything,
including our foreign aid money.

723
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:26,677
How are we going to serve those
who depend on our services

724
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:28,449
if we can't keep
our doors open?

725
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:31,459
This girl killed a man
in self-defence.

726
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,290
But the court doesn't
believe that.

727
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:38,629
The Ministry of Justice, the governing
body of civil society and NGOs,

728
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:43,694
has suspended Andinet Women
Lawyers Association indefinitely.

729
01:15:46,508 --> 01:15:48,339
Excuse me, please.

730
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,709
Are you ok?

731
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:31,615
Yeah, I'm ok.

732
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:35,113
Go inside.
I'm coming.

733
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:04,182
Hello, Gash Hiruy.
They shut down my organisation.

734
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:10,423
They cannot shut me down
without a reason.

735
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:23,230
Hirut's court appointment
is in a month.

736
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:45,416
Where is Meaza Ashenafi?

737
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:53,193
I'm here to inform you that, due to
the suspension of your organisation,

738
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:55,930
you are no longer Hirut's lawyer.

739
01:17:56,004 --> 01:18:01,636
That means Hirut is to be placed back
in custody of the village police.

740
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:04,234
Where is the girl?

741
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:08,876
- She isn't here.
- Then where is she?

742
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,578
I don't know.
Not here.

743
01:18:32,107 --> 01:18:33,540
She isn't here, sir.

744
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:38,272
I will give you a day to bring
her to the police station.

745
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:42,241
Don't forget she is in your
custody by court order.

746
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:47,785
I don't need to remind you that you
are responsible for her whereabouts.

747
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:50,320
Let's go.

748
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:54,555
Next case.

749
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,028
Your Honour,

750
01:18:56,131 --> 01:19:01,179
the court calls Andinet Women
Lawyers Association,

751
01:19:01,518 --> 01:19:03,309
case number 217.

752
01:19:04,283 --> 01:19:09,368
Andinet Women Lawyers Association
versus the Ministry of Justice.

753
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:24,356
- Look, counsellor...
- Honourable Court,

754
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:28,021
Andinet Women Lawyers Association
wants to be heard in this courtroom.

755
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:32,990
I know that the
Minister is not here.

756
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:36,595
But if he were here, what I would
want to say to him is that I am...

757
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:40,871
Hirut is not a murderer.

758
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:43,570
Actually, she is a brave girl.

759
01:19:43,678 --> 01:19:46,806
We all have a lot
to learn from her.

760
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:50,518
Our citizens have a
given right to freedom.

761
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:53,554
Yes, including women.

762
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,146
Hirut knows her rights.

763
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:59,249
Of course, except for the limitations
that are put on her by tradition.

764
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:05,566
I was a judge before
I started this organisation.

765
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:08,501
I left the seat because I was convinced
that the time had finally come

766
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:11,538
when all citizens of this country,
men, women, and children,

767
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:14,370
would be treated
equally under the law.

768
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:16,273
I still believe that.

769
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:20,508
The Ministry of Justice illegally shut down
our organisation without explanation.

770
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:23,608
And, to date, no charges
have been made against us.

771
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:28,212
Your Honour, it is within our rights
to sue a civil servant in a court of law.

772
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:30,621
We have done nothing illegal.

773
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,824
If I'm at fault, my mistakes
shouldn't determine Hirut's fate.

774
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:38,559
Since this organisation is
community-based,

775
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:41,227
the people who are really affected
by the closure of the office

776
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:42,633
are the poor women and children

777
01:20:42,737 --> 01:20:46,173
who otherwise have no legal
advice or representation.

778
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:50,234
So, I am asking this court
to do what's right.

779
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:53,712
Reinstate our permit and lift the ban
on our practice in the legal system.

780
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:55,806
Thank you, your Honour.

781
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:59,547
This court has heard your case.

782
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:03,925
But there will be no
judgement made

783
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:07,257
until this court hears from
the Ministry of Justice.

784
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:13,728
Next case.

785
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:43,690
We have to turn her
in to the police.

786
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:49,470
You've done what you can.

787
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:54,836
Is there anything I can do
to buy us time?

788
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:59,372
This is it, Aster.

789
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:53,064
- You again.
- May I sit down?

790
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:55,699
Sure.

791
01:22:58,873 --> 01:23:00,864
Whatever she's drinking.

792
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,584
Thank you.

793
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:27,027
Where did you tell your
husband you were going?

794
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:30,370
I said I was going out drinking.

795
01:23:32,974 --> 01:23:35,499
Not playing by the books
these days, are you?

796
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:44,777
Sorry I left you.

797
01:23:46,287 --> 01:23:48,653
You don't have
to be sorry.

798
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:50,782
It's all my fault.

799
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:55,159
I'm with you.

800
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:01,159
I thought I would
find you here.

801
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:04,204
- How are you?
- They fired the Minister of Justice.

802
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:06,433
They say he resigned,
but I know he got fired.

803
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:09,009
What?
Are you sure?

804
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:12,546
The ministry has reinstated your permit.
It'll be all over the news any minute.

805
01:24:12,614 --> 01:24:15,742
- What time do you have?
- We can make it.

806
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:37,228
Good morning, listeners.
Today we are broadcasting

807
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:40,392
from the Central Village
Regional High Court.

808
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:46,768
We will transmit live the court
proceedings and the judges' decision.

809
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:52,836
It is dead quiet here in the courtroom
as the three judges walk in.

810
01:25:56,718 --> 01:25:59,414
The courtroom is so hushed,

811
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:03,787
you can hear every word being
written on a piece of paper.

812
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:28,407
Hirut stands in the
defendant's dock.

813
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:30,644
All eyes in the room are on her.

814
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:50,528
Your Honour,
we'd like to call a witness.

815
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:54,005
- Mr Gebeyehu Gebru.
- Present.

816
01:26:55,476 --> 01:26:59,412
Your Honour, this man was not
present at the time of the murder.

817
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:01,907
I will allow the witness.

818
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,425
Sit down.

819
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:18,098
Do you know the defendant?

820
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:20,760
Yes, I know Hirut.

821
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:26,103
You were at the police station
when Hirut was brought in, right?

822
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:28,335
Kill her!

823
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:32,305
She should be hung!

824
01:27:43,057 --> 01:27:46,584
So, if you have heard her statement,
can you explain to the court

825
01:27:46,694 --> 01:27:49,458
what happened after she was taken
to the abductor's home?

826
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:52,863
She said she was exhausted
by the beating

827
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:56,199
they had given her on
the way to his house.

828
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:58,637
And then on the same night,

829
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:03,142
her abductor raped her
and took her virginity.

830
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:16,052
I didn't see her
doing the killing.

831
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:18,991
I just saw her at the police station
while she was making her statement.

832
01:28:19,093 --> 01:28:20,685
Are you done?

833
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:26,461
Earlier that day, I saw Tadele
and his friends riding their horses.

834
01:28:27,235 --> 01:28:29,203
They were carrying a gun, too.

835
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:31,238
Where were they going?

836
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:34,002
They were heading
towards the school.

837
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:38,076
You may step down.

838
01:28:43,584 --> 01:28:48,021
Defendant, what do you have
to say in your defence?

839
01:28:50,058 --> 01:28:52,891
I don't think of myself
as a murderer.

840
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:56,222
All I did was protect myself.

841
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:04,627
I don't feel sorry for that man.
I could have been killed.

842
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:27,557
At the moment, the three judges
are talking among themselves.

843
01:29:27,628 --> 01:29:30,062
And here is the Head Judge.

844
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:36,736
We have heard the witnesses
on both sides

845
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:43,008
and seen the report of the pathologist
attached to this case.

846
01:29:46,614 --> 01:29:50,448
We found, in the evidence of the
defence and the pathologist's report,

847
01:29:51,452 --> 01:29:55,800
that the deceased used force

848
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:58,673
to harm the defendant.

849
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:02,355
His actions violated the law.

850
01:30:03,564 --> 01:30:05,930
The court understands

851
01:30:06,033 --> 01:30:10,231
that the defendant was
deprived of the right

852
01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:13,307
she has been given by the law
to protect herself.

853
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:16,519
The actions you took...

854
01:30:17,567 --> 01:30:22,470
were the only course
you had to defend yourself.

855
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:26,786
So, according to paragraph 74,

856
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:31,286
you will not be convicted
for what you did.

857
01:30:42,003 --> 01:30:45,200
The court sets you free.

858
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:02,778
Why are you crying, Hirut?
We won.

859
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:08,447
I don't feel like I won anything.

860
01:32:09,957 --> 01:32:12,152
I can't even protect
my little sister.

861
01:32:13,794 --> 01:32:15,762
They will get her one day.

862
01:32:16,664 --> 01:32:19,861
Can't you see that?
I can't save her.

863
01:33:14,221 --> 01:33:16,246
Drop me off here, please.

864
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:21,759
- What's wrong, Hirut?
- I just want to walk.

865
01:33:23,497 --> 01:33:25,488
Stop the car, Samuel.

866
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:18,975
Are you sure you know
where you're going?

867
01:34:21,088 --> 01:34:24,251
Yes, I know it from here.

868
01:36:06,910 --> 01:36:12,704
