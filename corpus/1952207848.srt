The trajectory of the light beam's gotta
match the curvature of the moonstone

at a 90-degree angle

into pixie dust.

you get the most blue pixie dust

00:24:58,515 --> 00:25:01,746
Tinker Bell!
I wasn't expecting to see you tonight.

366
00:25:02,052 --> 00:25:04,247
Have you finished the scepter?

00:25:04,454 --> 00:25:06,888
Well, not exactly.

I mean, I have to ask you...

369
00:25:10,994 --> 00:25:12,552
Yes?

370
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:14,591
It's about the moonstone.

371
00:25:14,698 --> 00:25:18,691
What happened to it? You didn't lose it.
Tell me you didn't lose it!

372
00:25:18,802 --> 00:25:21,430
- I didn't lose it.
- Good.

373
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:25,440
But I was thinking, if using one
moonstone creates blue pixie dust,

374
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:27,908
using two would create even more.

375
00:25:28,545 --> 00:25:30,012
Do you have another moonstone?

376
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:34,277
That moonstone is the only one found
in the last 100 years.

the pixie dust tree would grow weak,

the third wish,

Where is the fall scepter?

875
01:07:49,411 --> 01:07:51,470
There were complications,

876
01:07:52,848 --> 01:07:55,248
but it's ready now, Your Highness.

877
01:07:55,684 --> 01:07:57,174
This way, dear.

878
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:09,661

I present the autumn scepter.

No, no, no. Don't worry, Fairy Mary.
Just... Just wait.

884
01:08:25,714 --> 01:08:28,114
Wait, wait.

885
01:08:28,517 --> 01:08:30,109
Come on, come on.

Please work. Please work. Please work.

887
01:08:55,511 --> 01:08:59,880
Your Majesty, I've never seen
this much blue pixie dust before.

888
01:09:00,048 --> 01:09:01,208
(CHUCKLING) Indeed.

889
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:06,250
It's at least a million smidges.
Maybe more.

890
01:09:06,555 --> 01:09:10,514
- It's more.
- Yeah. Much more.

891
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:13,018
This is amazing!

- Pretty good, huh?

894
01:09:19,234 --> 01:09:21,498
Come on, girls. It's show time.

895

QUEEN CLARION: Fairies

896
01:09:25,474 --> 01:09:29,570
we have celebrated this revelry
without interruption for centuries.

897
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:33,840
Tonight, I believe,
is our finest revelry ever,

898
01:09:34,917 --> 01:09:38,614
thanks to one very special fairy,
Tinker Bell.

899
01:09:42,224 --> 01:09:43,748
And her friend, Terence.

900
01:09:45,494 --> 01:09:47,792
- And her new friend.
- Blaze.

901
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:52,333
Yes, of course. Blaze.
We owe them all our thanks.

- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you, Fairy Mary.

905
01:10:01,877 --> 01:10:03,902
What made you think
of breaking the moonstone

906
01:10:04,012 --> 01:10:06,446
into all those tiny little pieces?

907
01:10:06,915 --> 01:10:08,075
Genius!

All right, everyone.
To the pixie-dust tree!

It worked, Bobble! It worked!

915
01:10:45,153 --> 01:10:47,280
Aye, it certainly did.
