00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,376
Not a good night
to miss a train, friend.

8
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,886
You have your ticket?

9
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,549
Hey, your ticket.

10
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:28,007
You speak English?
English?

11
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:32,350
Okay, pay me later.

12
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:33,789
We gotta move out.

13
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:36,441
Bad storm up ahead.
It's only gonna get worse. Okay?

14
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:50,489
All right, Walter.
Get us out of here.

Hi. Merry Christmas.

Here. Go ahead. Take it.

MILES:
Ah.

26
00:06:58,271 --> 00:07:00,344
Hey.

27
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:02,586
Rather be somewhere warm?

28
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:04,793
Uh... Yeah.

29
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:07,229
How much do I owe you
for the ticket?

30
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,945
You already paid for it
two hours ago.

31
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:12,469
Didn't say where you were going,
so I just charged you the full fare.

32
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,374
Yeah, just a little too much
eggnog at the office party.

33
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,797
Yeah.

34
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:24,408
All right, sir.
Time to take care of that ticket.

35
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:29,846
Rise and shine, buddy.
No free naps on my train.

36
00:07:45,183 --> 00:07:47,572
Goddamn!

37
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,751
Hear what I said?

38
00:07:52,543 --> 00:07:54,398
A stroke, maybe.

39
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:55,771
What?

40
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:58,422
You mean he's dead?

41
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:00,794
Yeah, heart attack's possible.

42
00:08:00,895 --> 00:08:02,270
Maybe from all that running
in the cold.

43
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:04,439
Hey, you know what?

44
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:07,477
He swallowed a bunch of pills
when he first sat down.

45
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,859
He threw them back like peanuts

46
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,098
and then washed it down
with a slug of vodka.

47
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,338
Yeah, he took a few pops
before he boarded the train.

48
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:18,807
- Do you think it was cyanide?
- CHLOE: Seconal.

49
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:22,398
Cyanide would have killed him
right away.

50
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:23,704
Seconal... reds.

51
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:26,040
If you take too much,
it will stop your blood flow

52
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:28,510
and cut off
the oxygen supply to the brain.

53
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:32,949
You think you're going to sleep
and then you never wake up.

54
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,608
Alcohol speeds up the process.

55
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:40,793
Wait a minute. How was I supposed
to know what he was taking?

56
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,902
I wouldn't have offered him
a drop if I had known.

57
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,949
- Don't touch anything.
- Where you going?

58
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,292
I'm gonna radio ahead
to the next station.

59
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:51,830
Unless you want to ride
with him 'til morning.

60
00:08:51,935 --> 00:08:55,677
Merry Christmas.

61
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,304
Oh, God! Hey!

62
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:04,922
- He's still alive!
- It's just a reflex.

63
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:08,567
Reflex, my ass. He jumped
like he was struck by lightning.

64
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:11,518
He's dead.

65
00:09:13,695 --> 00:09:18,103
Hey, isn't it bad luck
if a dead man looks you in the eyes?

66
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:20,149
You know, I read that once where...

67
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:27,577
It means that Death
has seen you, and...

68
00:09:27,743 --> 00:09:29,434
...maybe it will track you
or something.

69
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:35,612
I don't know where I saw that.

70
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,766
This is a funny-looking thing.

71
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,951
Put it back. It's not yours.

72
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:51,993
Hey!

73
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,548
You hear what I said?

74
00:09:54,783 --> 00:09:56,507
Yeah.

75
00:10:16,607 --> 00:10:21,015
Look, there's a corpse right next to us,
and you go back to reading?

76
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:53,150
What are you doing?

77
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:57,652
The conductor told you
to leave it alone.

78
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,052
What is it?

79
00:11:17,023 --> 00:11:18,332
What do you see?

80
00:11:46,495 --> 00:11:47,869
Harry!

81
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:49,690
This is Miles on the <i>Nightingale.</i>

82
00:11:49,855 --> 00:11:52,538
Yeah, we're headed up
to Maple Creek, and I need to...

83
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,005
Hang up!
Just come back to the rear car!

84
00:11:55,103 --> 00:11:57,656
You'd better get back to your seat
before I put my foot up your butt!

85
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,799
Trust me!

86
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,498
Go ahead. See for yourself.

87
00:12:22,111 --> 00:12:23,671
Miss?

88
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,108
Miss?

89
00:12:28,255 --> 00:12:31,484
- I thought I told you two to...
- Will you just look inside?

90
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:49,239
Real?

91
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:51,710
Yeah.

92
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:54,425
See how the light reflects?

93
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:56,861
No imitations can do that.

94
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,104
Had an uncle once who taught me

95
00:12:58,206 --> 00:13:00,312
how to tell the difference
between reals and fakes.

96
00:13:00,415 --> 00:13:01,975
And if he were here right now,

97
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,250
he would say that they were realer
than a nun's tits.

98
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,693
How much do you think they are?

99
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:09,173
- Oh, I'd say at least five.
- Thousand?

100
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:12,186
What?

101
00:13:12,287 --> 00:13:13,596
- Million.
- Million?

102
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:15,635
Yeah.

103
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:22,110
Depending on the latest
pricing tables.

104
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:28,438
Yeah, I already tried that.
They're locked in place.

105
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:34,266
Hey! Do you got
a hammer or something?

106
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:36,222
PETE:
That might work!

107
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:46,936
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

108
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,301
I still got a dead man to report.

109
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:51,860
Wait a minute! Maybe we should
think about this first

110
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:53,908
before we do something
we'll regret later, all right?

111
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,014
I mean, I'm not talking
about stealing it. I'm just...

112
00:13:57,118 --> 00:13:59,868
All right, maybe we could keep half,

113
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:01,723
and then give
the other half to charity?

114
00:14:01,887 --> 00:14:03,643
Huh?
How about the Boys and Girls Club?

115
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:05,367
That's a good group. Huh?

116
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:07,996
Look...

117
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,784
Look, this is a lot of money
in front of us right now!

118
00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:12,756
That doesn't mean
anything to you? Huh? Miles?

119
00:14:12,863 --> 00:14:14,968
Chances are someone else
knows he's carrying it.

120
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:17,405
What happens
when they come looking for it?

121
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:19,194
We'll be long gone by then.

122
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,675
I won't. You and her
get off this train. I don't.

123
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:28,218
So quit, quit your job.
Retire. Huh?

124
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:29,912
You got a wife? Hmm?

125
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:33,593
Well, maybe she'd like to live in
a warmer climate for a change, huh?

126
00:14:33,694 --> 00:14:38,201
I can take care of my wife
without your help. Or a dead man's.

127
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:41,563
CHLOE:
What if no one knows he's dead?

128
00:14:45,982 --> 00:14:48,317
What did you just say, Miss?

129
00:14:48,415 --> 00:14:52,244
If the body isn't reported,
no one will know he's dead.

130
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:55,610
He didn't buy a ticket.

131
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:59,639
That's why you came back here
in the first place.

132
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:01,433
No one will know
he was ever on this train.

133
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,568
But he's on this train.
My train.

134
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,940
What am I supposed to do,
let him rot to New Year's?

135
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,909
One second.

136
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,377
So we left Fall Brook, and we're
headed toward Maple Creek, correct?

137
00:15:28,478 --> 00:15:30,039
How much time 'til we get there?

138
00:15:32,606 --> 00:15:34,973
29 minutes, 16 seconds.

139
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:36,216
You know that down to the second?

140
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:38,522
I know everything about this train
except its favorite color.

141
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:40,541
- And this is a river.
- MILES: It's the Sturgeon River.

142
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:41,750
Well, how much time
until we cross that?

143
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:43,129
We cross that in 19 minutes.

144
00:15:43,295 --> 00:15:45,499
Is it wide enough that it
doesn't freeze over in winter?

145
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,157
I suppose.

146
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:49,851
Strong rapids?

147
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,054
I guess so. Why?

148
00:15:54,975 --> 00:15:57,309
That's where we can dump the body.

149
00:15:57,407 --> 00:16:00,538
I mean, with the rapids, there won't
be any connection to the train.

150
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:03,190
'Cause it's winter, it'll
probably get stuck under the ice

151
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:05,366
and found sometime in spring,

152
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:09,588
all decomposed down to the bone.

153
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:14,522
Miles. I don't know,
maybe she's onto something here.

154
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:17,437
Yeah, a prison sentence.
One I'm not serving.

155
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,486
You won't be connected.

156
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,315
You're just the conductor.
You've just been doing your job.

157
00:16:23,423 --> 00:16:25,048
And he was
passed out drunk the entire time.

158
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,525
He doesn't know anything.

159
00:16:26,622 --> 00:16:29,470
I was, and I usually am.
Which is... it's true.

160
00:16:29,566 --> 00:16:32,915
I'm getting off at the next stop.

161
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,608
So, it's as if we're strangers
and we've never met.

162
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,653
Yeah, and it's staying that way.

163
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,581
Miles! Don't...

164
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,526
Follow me, and it's your ass
that's gonna be dumped, not him!

165
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,943
11 years in sales,

166
00:16:58,046 --> 00:17:00,599
and I can't convince
a working-stiff conductor

167
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:02,676
to keep a fortune
for his retirement.

168
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:11,164
Oh, did I mention I suck at my job?

169
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:15,321
Maybe you should try
convincing him again.

170
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,576
Yeah. Well.

171
00:17:19,678 --> 00:17:22,362
He's made the call by now.

172
00:17:24,574 --> 00:17:26,330
How can you be so sure
what he's doing up there?

173
00:17:31,102 --> 00:17:33,339
Well, what the hell else
would he be doing?

174
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,361
What?

175
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:45,118
You think he lied?

176
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,814
Huh?

177
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:47,773
And he's keeping it all for himself?

178
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:54,232
Stay here!

179
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:05,715
The only way to get in and out
is with my key.

180
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:07,959
I'll grab a wheelchair we use
for handicapped passengers.

181
00:18:08,063 --> 00:18:09,524
Right, now we're talking.

182
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:10,875
We should put him
into something, though,

183
00:18:10,974 --> 00:18:12,862
so that nobody sees him
floating down the river.

184
00:18:13,023 --> 00:18:15,095
We've got suitcases and a trunk
in the baggage car.

185
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,411
Is the baggage car far from here?

186
00:18:16,574 --> 00:18:18,036
At the other end of the train.

187
00:18:18,142 --> 00:18:19,997
Well, we just need
to wheel him over there

188
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:22,167
without anybody
on the train noticing.

189
00:18:22,271 --> 00:18:24,126
I'll lead the way,
clear a path for you two.

190
00:18:24,223 --> 00:18:25,400
How are you gonna do that?

191
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:27,030
Diversion, charm.

192
00:18:27,902 --> 00:18:30,291
I'm a salesman, aren't I?

193
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:43,894
It's a good game.

194
00:18:44,062 --> 00:18:46,932
Too close to the edge.

195
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:48,925
If you can't attack him effectively,

196
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:51,640
leaves you weak in
your defenses. Okay?

197
00:18:51,742 --> 00:18:53,652
Don't worry, I'm gonna
help you out, too.

198
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:56,758
Are you all...

199
00:18:56,862 --> 00:18:59,415
...covered with traveler's insurance
on your stay here?

200
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:05,147
Well, my company, we specialize
in covering tourists such as yourself.

201

Here, check it out.

206
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:20,309

in there.

[Speaking Japanese]

208
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:24,022
What? Marquesas Islands?

209
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:26,515
- Marquesas...!
- Yeah, yeah, you like?

210
00:19:27,358 --> 00:19:28,700
Marquesas Islands.

211
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,133
PETE:
It's in the South Pacific, right by y'all.

212
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:33,118
Here, let me show you. It's, uh...

213
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,872
Yeah, you got Japan up...

214
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:43,322
And this is only one island
in the whole chain.

215
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:45,853
All of them, created by volcanoes.

216
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:53,752
Did you all see me back there,
kicking ass?

217
00:19:53,854 --> 00:19:55,480
I mean, what am I doing in sales?

218
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,972
Check the next car.
There's an old lady sitting in there.

219
00:19:58,142 --> 00:20:00,892
No worries. Okay, Miles? I'm just
gonna sweet talk her, like I did...

220
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,714
Don't worry, honey.
It's all under control.

221
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:05,881
You know what? In my line of work,
you got to improvise all the time.

222
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:07,061
Is that how you ended up drunk
on the train

223
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,375
with no idea what stop
you were getting off at?

224
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,389
Hey, come on.
We get delayed, we miss the bridge.

225
00:20:10,495 --> 00:20:13,277
Relax! Okay?
I got it under control.

226
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:23,228
Come on!

233
00:20:45,022 --> 00:20:48,121

<i>in here for the rest of the journey?</i>

234
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:53,691
Oh, thank heavens for that.

235
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:57,206
There we go, my clever little boy.

236
00:20:58,558 --> 00:20:59,321
Oh!

237
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:02,008
How are you and Poochie doing?

238
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,728
Well, between you and me,
we are suffering from a bit of gas,

239
00:21:04,894 --> 00:21:08,724
but we're still going
to have our midnight meal.

240
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:10,871
Oh, good heavens!

241
00:21:10,975 --> 00:21:15,098
- What's he doing in my car?
- I guess he wanted to take a nap.

242
00:21:15,198 --> 00:21:17,751
Yes, but he certainly does
look dead to the world.

243
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:20,438
MILES: A bit too much
holiday cheer, I'm afraid.

244
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:24,633
Oh, dear, that's why I left
my second husband Alfred.

245
00:21:25,438 --> 00:21:28,951
He was having too much
holiday cheer seven days a week.

All right, stop!

Poochie!
Leave the poor old souse alone.

251
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,404
Would you like to switch cars,
Ma'am?

252
00:21:49,502 --> 00:21:50,647
Well, perhaps I'd better.

253
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,343
Poochie certainly
doesn't care for him,

254
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:53,821
and I really trust
his taste in people.

255
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,544
MILES:
I'll get your things.

256
00:21:55,646 --> 00:21:58,515
- Oh, thank you, dear.
- Yeah. Call me Miles.

257
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:09,843
Okay.
How much time do we have?

258
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:13,595
MILES:
11 minutes.

259
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,369
This one's the biggest.

260
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:19,805
Incoming!

00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,387
CHLOE:
Take it away.

Miles...

263
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,307
...tell me you have
a bigger trunk than this.

264
00:22:43,518 --> 00:22:45,079
MILES:
No.

265
00:22:45,246 --> 00:22:46,010
What?

266
00:22:47,294 --> 00:22:48,919
- No.
- No?

267
00:22:49,086 --> 00:22:49,686
No!

268
00:22:51,134 --> 00:22:53,719
You said that he was gonna fit
into something.

269
00:22:53,822 --> 00:22:56,026
That's why we brought him
all the way back here!

270
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,652
I said there was
luggage in the back.

271
00:22:57,758 --> 00:22:59,384
Maybe it was unloaded
five stops ago!

272
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,663
- I don't know.
- Well, you know all...

273
00:23:00,702 --> 00:23:02,807
You know all the train routes
down to the second,

274
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,536
but you can't seem to figure this out!

275
00:23:04,638 --> 00:23:08,828
Hey, packing dead bodies
was not part of my job training!

276
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:11,228
- CHLOE: This is ridiculous.
- Dammit!

277
00:23:11,326 --> 00:23:12,537
MILES:
It's not gonna work.

278
00:23:12,638 --> 00:23:16,315
Okay. All right, sorry.
I'm sorry. New plan.

279
00:23:16,414 --> 00:23:18,138
New plan.

280
00:23:18,238 --> 00:23:21,948
When we arrive at the next station,
I'm gonna take him off myself.

281
00:23:22,046 --> 00:23:23,453
All right? Yeah!

282
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,412
Yeah!

283
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,129
I'm gonna put his arm
around my shoulder.

284
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:32,533
I'm gonna just walk him out
like he's drunk, like he's my buddy.

285
00:23:32,638 --> 00:23:36,184
And I'm gonna take him off
into the woods or...

286
00:23:37,054 --> 00:23:39,803
...by the garbage dump, or...

287
00:23:47,838 --> 00:23:49,748
Excuse me.

does that mean she loses her share?

- We're taking him back to his seat.
- What?

296
00:24:29,822 --> 00:24:33,651
Yeah, we are going to forget
this madness ever...

297
00:24:33,758 --> 00:24:35,863
- Sorry it took me so long.
- Yeah.

298
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:38,071
I had to leave the kitchen car
with some gopher.

299
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:39,667
Wait. What were you doing?

- Improvising.
- What, what, what?

Gonna be quick, all right?

303
00:24:53,918 --> 00:24:59,188
We have approximately 7 minutes
before we cross the bridge, all right?

304
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:00,788
- Okay.
- MILES: Hey!

305
00:25:03,358 --> 00:25:04,306
Hey, stop!

306
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,259
What's wrong, Miles?

307
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,364
- What's wrong?
- This is what we have to do.

308
00:25:09,534 --> 00:25:13,243
You're about to carve into that fellow
like he's a Christmas turkey.

309
00:25:13,374 --> 00:25:15,381
I took an autopsy class
last semester.

310

where to make the incisions.

You're not thinking straight, Miss.

312
00:25:19,422 --> 00:25:21,877
You've got to clear your head.

313
00:25:22,878 --> 00:25:24,504
My head's never been more clear.

314
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,395
Hey, put down that knife.

315
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:28,445
It's a meat cleaver.

316
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,129
We're taking him back to his seat.

317
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,027
I'm calling in the authorities.
It's already been decided.

318
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:35,864
Did you agree to this?

319
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:39,414
Well, we...
We didn't take a vote.

320
00:25:39,518 --> 00:25:42,104
- Okay, well, let's take a vote.
- PETE: Right.

321
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,644
Okay.

322
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,629
Raise our hands, secret ballot.

323
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,830
Hey, there's no vote!
No democracy!

324
00:25:47,998 --> 00:25:51,926
My train is a damn dictatorship,
and I'm the damn dictator!

325
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:55,323
So, put down that knife, cleaver,
or whatever the hell you call it,

326
00:25:55,358 --> 00:26:00,115
and return to your damn seat
and your damn senses!

327
00:26:02,878 --> 00:26:06,707
All right, Miles.

328
00:26:06,814 --> 00:26:08,188
You're in charge.

332
00:26:33,566 --> 00:26:38,868
I'm sorry, Miles.
We agreed upon a plan.

333
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:43,546
Not his. Not yours. Mine.

334
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,718
And that's what
we're going to carry out.

335
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:48,538
You can't call the cops now,
unless you can explain

336
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:50,842
how he got his head chopped off
from having a heart attack.

337
00:26:51,582 --> 00:26:54,102
We don't have that much time
before we cross the bridge.

338
00:26:54,205 --> 00:26:56,311
I'm going to take care
of his arms and legs.

339
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,007
- Oh, my God!
- We're gonna fit him into the trunk.

340
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,969
I guess this would be the downside
to working with strangers...

341
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,380
the possibility that one of them
turns out to be a psychotic.

342

She's crazy, but she may be right
about one thing.

343

We can't call the cops.
There's no way to explain this.

344
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:31,639
She put us in one hell
of a corner, you know?

345
00:27:32,446 --> 00:27:33,526
You know what?

346
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:37,558
I think it might be a good idea if I take
him off at the next station, you know?

347
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:41,240
Find a nice safe place to bury him.
Done. You know?

348
00:27:41,342 --> 00:27:44,571
I mean, now that we know
that she's not in her right mind.

349
00:27:46,814 --> 00:27:48,853
- Are you?
- What?

350
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,485
In your right mind?

351
00:27:53,021 --> 00:27:54,331
Sure.

352
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:58,172
I've seen a lot of bad things
in my life.

353
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,882
But even in my worst moments,
I always knew who I was.

354
00:28:02,686 --> 00:28:03,831
Well...

355
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:07,512
Come on, you're still the same man
that you were before.

356
00:28:07,614 --> 00:28:11,673
Everything changed
when we looked inside of that thing.

357
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:15,451
Yeah. I mean, we're talking
about a lot of money here.

358
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,827
[Chloe grunts]

359
00:28:16,926 --> 00:28:20,024
It's not about the money.

360
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:23,923
When I looked inside I...

361
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,721
I felt...

362
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,484
What?

363
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:37,719
Different.

364
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:51,923
Hey, I'm taking him off the train
at the next station.

365
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,885
- What?
- Yeah, go home to your family.

366
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,837
Sip eggnog, roast chestnuts,

367
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,300
put some carrots out
for Santa's reindeer, okay?

368
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:00,951
- Miles?
- No, Miles is out of commission.

369
00:29:01,054 --> 00:29:02,461
Okay? I'm in charge now.

370
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:04,925
- We're almost at the bridge.
- Forget about the bridge.

371
00:29:05,021 --> 00:29:07,388
We're on a new route,
and I'm behind the wheel.

372
00:29:07,486 --> 00:29:09,079
Okay, now, I'm gonna
be taking a higher cut.

373
00:29:09,182 --> 00:29:12,531
Only fair. Right? Of course,
because now I'm taking a greater risk.

374
00:29:12,638 --> 00:29:14,231
I think we both know
who took the greater risk.

375
00:29:14,334 --> 00:29:15,708
We're taking it off the train
right now.

376
00:29:15,806 --> 00:29:18,173
What are you gonna do,
chop me into little pieces if I do?

377
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,163
Well, I could take something

378
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:21,150
and I could just jam it
into your carotid artery.

379
00:29:21,245 --> 00:29:22,041
You wouldn't feel anything,

380
00:29:22,142 --> 00:29:23,703
and then you'd go to pull it out

381
00:29:23,806 --> 00:29:26,708
and then you'd loose all blood flow
to your brain in under 5 seconds.

382
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,583
MILES:
We've got three minutes to the bridge.

383
00:29:32,765 --> 00:29:34,708
We're finishing what we started.

384
00:29:35,614 --> 00:29:39,705
[Men grunting]

385
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:47,192
Where's the bridge?
Did we cross it already?

386
00:29:47,294 --> 00:29:49,181
I can't see it yet!

387
00:29:51,742 --> 00:29:54,164
- This is crazy!
- Go inside! Go inside!

388
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,162
Where's the bridge, Miles?

389
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:00,920
Hey, here it comes! It's coming!

390
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:06,205
Now!

391
00:30:07,134 --> 00:30:08,475
MILES:
Let's do it! Let's do it!

392
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:11,160
- This is it! Come on!
- Pick it up! Lift it!

393
00:30:13,758 --> 00:30:14,619
Go!

394
00:30:14,718 --> 00:30:17,085
Let's do the damn thing!
Come on! Lift it!

395
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:39,069
Did we make it?

[Door being shaken]

397
00:30:46,173 --> 00:30:47,034
Hide!

398
00:31:41,182 --> 00:31:43,800
Miles?
Miles, where are you?

399
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:46,362
Give me your 20. Over.

400
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:03,100
Chloe! Open the door!
Open the door!

401
00:32:03,198 --> 00:32:04,125
Hey!

402
00:32:04,285 --> 00:32:06,805
Hey, no one's going
to hear you! No one!

403
00:32:06,973 --> 00:32:08,566
Hey, you know what? Come on!
Don't waste your breath!

404
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,775
Don't waste your energy!
No one can hear you!

405
00:32:10,878 --> 00:32:12,503
We're going
to freeze to death out here!

406
00:32:12,606 --> 00:32:14,428
We're not going
to freeze to death out here!

407
00:32:14,526 --> 00:32:17,722
I'll be coming right back!

408
00:32:17,822 --> 00:32:18,837
What are you doing?

409
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:22,935
Hey, I'm coming back to get you!
I'm coming back! Stay here!

410
00:32:23,037 --> 00:32:25,012
Are you crazy?

411
00:32:25,469 --> 00:32:26,397
God!

412

What are you doing here?

421
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:37,949
I stole these...

422
00:33:38,046 --> 00:33:41,843
...and I was heading back to the
baggage car to save the two of you.

423
00:33:44,893 --> 00:33:47,162

get back to your seat. You, too.

into the kitchen.

Go back to sleep, baby.
I just wanted you to know

you'll be moving into the nice wing
of the hospital soon.

get you your own room there,

be wrong with me?

to the cops if I hadn't done it.

justify yourself to me, okay?

I've never cut off a man's head
for a commission before.

anything like that before.

have made the effort.

You're locking me in here with her?
Now, what's the point of that?

where their daughter is?

I just don't care.

493

to med school.

when you're young, kid.

I mean, was wide open, you know?

500

Yeah. Forget about it.
Here's your keys.

00:40:42,301 --> 00:40:47,386
Here, see?
Look at that.

519
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:49,819
- And you know what?
- What?

520
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:52,502
I don't even want any.

521
00:40:52,861 --> 00:40:57,618
- For the first time since I was 15.
- Congratulations.

522
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:01,366
I really do need a promotion.

523
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:04,088
You know how it is,
taking care of a family, and...

524
00:41:04,189 --> 00:41:07,735
- Oh, you got to get another job, kid.
- Huh?

525
00:41:07,837 --> 00:41:10,936
You can't take care of a wife
and baby working on a train.

526
00:41:11,037 --> 00:41:12,411
Go back to school.

527
00:41:12,573 --> 00:41:16,883
Learn about computers, airplanes,
something with a future.

528
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:18,780
What do you mean?
You're not gonna recommend me?

529
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:22,008
The train is a dead end.
It's a relic, okay?

530
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:23,451
But I wanna be a conductor
just like you.

531
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:25,110
You don't want to be
anything like me.

532
00:41:25,278 --> 00:41:27,165
- I want to be!
- Are you fucking deaf?

533
00:41:28,957 --> 00:41:30,812
You're not gonna be like me!

534
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:33,276
You're not gonna
work on a train! Never!

[Train powers off]

536
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:53,650
So, what do you say?
It's all coming together.

537
00:41:53,757 --> 00:41:57,816
I'm free of the booze.
You're off your folks.

538
00:41:57,917 --> 00:42:03,068
What do you say to a warm climate
and a new beginning?

539
00:42:05,277 --> 00:42:07,895
Thanks, but...

540
00:42:07,997 --> 00:42:13,780
...I spent enough of my life
following somebody else's dreams.

541
00:42:13,885 --> 00:42:15,827
Do you know what I mean?

542
00:42:34,013 --> 00:42:35,638
I'm frightfully sorry.
I haven't got a ticket.

543
00:42:35,741 --> 00:42:38,108
The ticket office
appears to be closed.

544
00:42:38,205 --> 00:42:40,441
- You can pay it later.
- No, no, my good man.

545
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:42,516
I shall pay immediately.

546
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:47,094
Tell me, is the bar on board
still open by any chance?

547
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,618
All night for the holidays.

548
00:42:49,725 --> 00:42:51,383
Some dark Jamaican rum
would be just the ticket.

549
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,518
Perhaps you'd be kind enough
to send it down to the rear car?

550
00:42:56,093 --> 00:42:57,554
Please, keep the change.

551
00:42:59,165 --> 00:43:00,441
Merry Christmas.

Oh, dear.

554
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:11,384
I was supposed
to meet a friend there.

555
00:43:11,484 --> 00:43:13,459
Short fellow. Mr. Cairo.

556
00:43:13,565 --> 00:43:15,637
Got on at the last stop.
Couldn't miss him.

557

You don't know where he's sitting,
by any chance?

558
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:18,842
No.

559
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:21,308
You mean, you don't know
which car he moved to?

560
00:43:21,405 --> 00:43:24,950
I mean, I haven't seen anyone
on this train by that description.

561
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:26,715
Oh.

562
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:31,253
And no one has left a message
or asked for me?

563
00:43:31,357 --> 00:43:34,652
- My name is Mr. Gutman.
- No.

564
00:43:35,645 --> 00:43:39,703
Well, I shall just
have to find him myself.

565
00:43:39,805 --> 00:43:41,496
Never mind.

Where the hell are you?

568

MR. GUTMAN:
...so he was staying here...

569
00:44:03,293 --> 00:44:06,227
Miles! This gentleman
is looking for a friend.

570
00:44:06,397 --> 00:44:08,764
A short guy.

571
00:44:08,797 --> 00:44:10,968
What happened to that man
who got on at Fall Brook?

572
00:44:12,957 --> 00:44:14,844
All nervous, taking pills?

573
00:44:14,941 --> 00:44:18,007
Oh, him?

574
00:44:18,109 --> 00:44:21,884
- He's who you're looking for?
- So, he <i>did</i> get on this train?

575
00:44:21,981 --> 00:44:24,370
Yes. No. I mean...

576
00:44:24,477 --> 00:44:27,324
He got on board,
but he got off again.

577
00:44:29,181 --> 00:44:30,807
He got off again?

578
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:33,495
He did? No.
When? I didn't see that.

579
00:44:33,597 --> 00:44:34,873
He said he couldn't
pay for his ticket,

580
00:44:35,037 --> 00:44:37,404
so he left before we
pulled out of the station.

581
00:44:39,229 --> 00:44:41,334
Why didn't you tell me this before?

582
00:44:41,437 --> 00:44:42,811
Oh, I didn't make the connection.

583
00:44:42,909 --> 00:44:45,145
We go through so many
passengers around the holidays.

584
00:44:45,245 --> 00:44:47,132
Well, do we? Since when?

585
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:53,522
It was my mistake.
I apologize.

Can't you call your friend
and find out where he is?

589
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:10,327
I shall never see him again.

590
00:45:10,428 --> 00:45:12,795
He betrayed me.

591
00:45:12,893 --> 00:45:15,064
He couldn't help it.

592
00:45:15,165 --> 00:45:16,212
Don't you have
his phone number or...

593
00:45:16,317 --> 00:45:20,027
Frankie, finish packing everything
in the kitchen.

Ah, Merry Christmas to you.

Oh, Poochie's really
looking forward to his breakfast,

600

and I'm going to have
an apricot brandy instead of tea.

601
00:45:46,237 --> 00:45:49,368
Why, I think it's perfectly acceptable
to raise a toast to Jesus

602
00:45:49,469 --> 00:45:50,843

603

that Poochie didn't like.

at the last station?

like my old seat back again.

00:51:17,437 --> 00:51:20,284
He was just trying to scare us.

689
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,769
Yeah, well, he did
a pretty good job at it.

690
00:51:22,876 --> 00:51:26,193
I wish I had never seen
those goddamn diamonds.

691
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:28,859
Diamonds?

692
00:51:28,957 --> 00:51:30,331
What, are you color-blind?

693
00:51:30,492 --> 00:51:31,834
They're emeralds.

694
00:51:31,933 --> 00:51:34,715
Never heard
of green diamonds before.

695
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,449
They're diamonds.
White diamonds.

696
00:51:39,773 --> 00:51:43,897
No. No. That's not what I saw.

697
00:51:53,372 --> 00:51:57,747

FRANKIE:
<i>Miles! Where are you?</i>

700
00:52:10,812 --> 00:52:12,089
How could you
not see the emeralds?

701
00:52:12,188 --> 00:52:14,523
They were so beautiful!
They were magnificent!

702
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:15,416
Look, if you wanna see them again,

703
00:52:15,516 --> 00:52:17,687
you're gonna come over here and
help me move his goddamn arms.

704
00:52:18,812 --> 00:52:22,741
The trunk hit the ice
just as it passed over the bridge.

705
00:52:22,844 --> 00:52:27,285
Two fellows out ice fishing
said it split open upon impact,

706
00:52:27,388 --> 00:52:30,236
spilling body parts out
all over the place.

707
00:52:30,332 --> 00:52:34,904
Arms. Legs. And a head.

708
00:52:35,004 --> 00:52:37,687
What kind of sicko
would've done such a thing?

709
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:43,954
Miles, I'm gonna need
to see the passenger list.

710
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,999
[Chloe and Pete grunt]

711
00:52:49,724 --> 00:52:51,480
Open it.

712
00:52:58,812 --> 00:53:01,714
- Okay. Wait here.
- Where are you going?

713
00:53:23,388 --> 00:53:23,955
CHLOE:
Open!

714
00:53:26,556 --> 00:53:29,404
- Nobody's in the sleepers, yeah?
- No, they've been locked up all night.

715
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,399
Hey, why are you throwing
my stuff up there with him?

716
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,061
You're gonna go up there.

717
00:53:35,164 --> 00:53:37,499
- What?
- Get up there right now.

718
00:53:37,597 --> 00:53:40,858
No! No. Not a chance in hell.
Why would...?

719
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:45,814
- Is your invitation still open?
- What?

720
00:53:46,204 --> 00:53:48,626
The Marquesas Islands.
You and me.

721
00:53:49,884 --> 00:53:52,437
You and me?

722
00:53:59,229 --> 00:54:01,596
So, who drinks Kalashnikov?

723
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:04,027
We can't trust Miles anymore.

724
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:06,034
He's gonna crack
with those cops on board.

725
00:54:07,068 --> 00:54:10,068
He's not like the two of us.
He doesn't want it badly enough.

726
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:14,805
It's gonna be you and me
from now on.

727
00:54:14,908 --> 00:54:19,032
Well, what do we want so badly?
We all saw different things inside.

728
00:54:19,133 --> 00:54:23,289
- You don't want it anymore?
- No. I just...

729
00:54:23,388 --> 00:54:24,336
You just what?

730
00:54:24,444 --> 00:54:26,745
I'm trying to figure out
what the hell is going on here.

731
00:54:26,844 --> 00:54:29,266
I'm just...
It's just all so confusing.

732
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:32,916
It doesn't have to be confusing.

733
00:54:37,021 --> 00:54:40,152
Go up there,
and I'll handle everything, okay?

734
00:54:42,204 --> 00:54:44,212
How are you gonna save us?

735
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:47,250
You gonna pin it all on Miles?

736
00:54:47,356 --> 00:54:49,844
Somebody has to take the fall.

737
00:54:51,517 --> 00:54:52,465
How are you gonna do it?

738
00:55:01,084 --> 00:55:03,735
When you trust me.

739
00:55:04,284 --> 00:55:06,935
Why should I?

740
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:10,741
You know why.

741
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,177
CHLOE:
You have to go up.

742
00:55:25,277 --> 00:55:27,284
Okay?
You need to go up now.

743
00:55:27,452 --> 00:55:28,913
No.

744
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,820
I already told you. I locked
all the compartments this morning.

745
00:55:36,988 --> 00:55:39,705
None of the passengers
are staying in the...

746
00:55:52,412 --> 00:55:53,077
Miss?

747
00:55:54,364 --> 00:55:55,575
Miss?

748
00:55:56,316 --> 00:55:58,934
I'm Detective Melville.

749
00:55:59,036 --> 00:56:01,654
I take it you're not Peter Dobbs.

750
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:08,982
I'd be pretty upset
if my parents named me that.

751
00:56:09,084 --> 00:56:13,110
This compartment's supposed
to be unoccupied and locked.

752
00:56:14,748 --> 00:56:19,320
I was really tired,
so I picked the lock.

753
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:22,868
I didn't know it was such a crime
you'd stop a whole train over it.

754
00:56:23,837 --> 00:56:25,876
What's your name, Ma'am?

755
00:56:26,268 --> 00:56:27,926
Chloe White.

756
00:56:28,029 --> 00:56:31,411
Says here, Miss White, that you were
supposed to get off at Maple Creek.

757
00:56:31,932 --> 00:56:35,281
Supposed to get off?

758
00:56:35,452 --> 00:56:36,500
You mean I missed my stop?

759
00:56:37,596 --> 00:56:42,135
My parents are gonna go berserk.
My mom was cooking this brisket.

760
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,595
She's gonna go nuts.

761
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:48,116
DETECTIVE: You've been
alone in here the whole time?

762
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:49,333
Of course.

763
00:56:50,588 --> 00:56:56,371
So, you always sleep naked
in beds that don't belong to you?

764
00:56:56,477 --> 00:56:57,556
Depends on the bed.

765
00:57:00,892 --> 00:57:04,787
Gosh, I didn't want to wrinkle
my Christmas dress.

766
00:57:08,028 --> 00:57:10,549
We'll take the interrogations
in the dining car.

767
00:57:10,652 --> 00:57:12,562
The interrogations?

768
00:57:12,668 --> 00:57:15,984
You've got two minutes
to get dressed, Ma'am.

769
00:57:29,692 --> 00:57:31,154
So, Peter Dobbs
is on this train for two hours,

770
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,649
and you don't get a look at his face?

771
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,642
Well, he's passed out
the whole time.

772
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:38,161
I just didn't get
a good look at his face.

773
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,867
No, we didn't get a good look
at his face, did we, Poochie?

774
00:57:42,972 --> 00:57:45,273
Well, he was asleep, you see,
when he was in my car.

775
00:57:45,372 --> 00:57:47,063
And Miles...
that's our conductor,

776
00:57:47,164 --> 00:57:48,276
charming man...

777
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:52,341
he said he thought he'd had
too much Christmas cheer.

778
00:57:52,444 --> 00:57:54,332
He was really drunk.

779
00:57:54,428 --> 00:57:55,803
Wasted.

780
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,355
All these little, mini liquor bottles.

781
00:57:59,068 --> 00:58:01,108
Did you happen
to notice a luggage trunk?

782
00:58:01,212 --> 00:58:04,310
Yeah, it was
an old-fashioned kind of thing.

783
00:58:04,412 --> 00:58:06,779
And did you see if he went
to the front of the train at all

784
00:58:06,876 --> 00:58:08,305
with the luggage trunk, Miss White?

785
00:58:08,412 --> 00:58:10,834
He left to the front of the train
right before I went to the sleeper car.

786
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:12,980
FRANKIE:
When I went into the baggage car,

787
00:58:13,084 --> 00:58:15,058
the loading door was wide open.

788
00:58:15,164 --> 00:58:19,125
So it was a screw up
at the last station, but if this...

789
00:58:19,228 --> 00:58:23,767
...Peter Dobbs is missing...

790
00:58:23,868 --> 00:58:26,738
well, maybe he was the one
who opened the door,

791
00:58:26,844 --> 00:58:28,470
so he could dump the body.

792
00:58:28,636 --> 00:58:31,386
So where is this Peter Dobbs now,
if he's not on the train?

793
00:58:34,204 --> 00:58:36,789
Marquesas Islands.

794
00:58:36,892 --> 00:58:40,504
He wants to go to these islands.

795
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:41,815
Right.

796
00:58:43,036 --> 00:58:44,214
Made by volcanoes.

797
00:58:52,124 --> 00:58:54,393
Hello?

798
00:58:54,556 --> 00:58:57,590
PETE:
Hey, what's going on?

799
00:58:57,788 --> 00:59:00,123
Make sure you bag evidence.

800
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:03,318
Miles, I'm gonna be
staying on board the <i>Nightingale,</i>

801
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:04,794
and when we pull into the station,

802
00:59:04,892 --> 00:59:09,464
the train will be impounded
as evidence.

803
00:59:12,252 --> 00:59:16,529
WALKIE-TALKIE: <i>Miles! I have</i>
<i>a loose air hose. I'm out of tape.</i>

804
00:59:25,596 --> 00:59:28,760
Get me out of this sardine can!

805
00:59:28,924 --> 00:59:31,858
Hey!

806
00:59:31,964 --> 00:59:32,858

807
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:38,808
Hey, what are you doing?

808
00:59:41,212 --> 00:59:44,441
Hey, what are you doing?

809
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:46,161
Hey!

810
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:53,238
Hey, I can't breathe! Hey!

811
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,998

813
01:00:03,323 --> 01:00:05,560
I can't breathe!

[Pete keeps banging on the door]

815
01:00:06,972 --> 01:00:08,052
I can't breathe!

816
01:00:08,156 --> 01:00:11,734
[Pete's voice is drowned out
by train wheels clacking on tracks]

817
01:00:56,604 --> 01:00:59,670
I need you to go
to the baggage car,

818
01:00:59,772 --> 01:01:03,765
take all the suitcases,
and bring them back to the sleeper.

819
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,707
All the suitcases?

820
01:01:06,812 --> 01:01:08,437
For both bodies.

821
01:01:10,364 --> 01:01:11,641
Wait a minute.

822
01:01:14,267 --> 01:01:16,755
He's dead?

823
01:01:16,924 --> 01:01:20,088
That depends on how much oxygen
he has left.

824
01:01:21,148 --> 01:01:23,352
It's just you and me now.

825
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:30,610
Come on, Miles.
It's the perfect plan.

826
01:01:30,716 --> 01:01:33,083
They're looking for his body.
They're on a manhunt for him.

827
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,765
And when they don't find it...

828
01:01:35,868 --> 01:01:39,480
...they'll close the case,
and we'll be in the clear.

829
01:01:40,539 --> 01:01:42,841
So you can go get the luggage.

830
01:01:43,708 --> 01:01:47,538
I'm not gonna have
anything to do with this.

831
01:01:47,644 --> 01:01:50,513
You want to see your wife again?

832
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:53,435
Hmm?

833
01:01:53,532 --> 01:01:56,663
You're completely gone.

834
01:01:56,764 --> 01:01:58,618
You know that, don't you?

835
01:01:59,483 --> 01:02:03,575
But I'm all you've got,
so go get the luggage.

836
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,649
Now.

837
01:02:48,764 --> 01:02:53,881
[Pete gasps]

838
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:20,118
Pete.

839
01:03:21,243 --> 01:03:22,039
Back up old man.

840
01:03:22,972 --> 01:03:23,670
Back!

841
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:28,407
On your knees!

842
01:03:29,116 --> 01:03:30,131
I confess.

843
01:03:31,836 --> 01:03:34,324
- I'll confess to everything.
- I said get on your fucking knees!

844
01:03:40,636 --> 01:03:41,105
No!

845
01:03:49,947 --> 01:03:51,158
Great, Miles.

846
01:03:54,876 --> 01:03:57,527
Now we have three dead bodies
instead of two.

847
01:03:58,748 --> 01:04:00,373
The man was right!

848
01:04:00,476 --> 01:04:02,865
We've got to destroy it
before it destroys us!

849
01:04:02,971 --> 01:04:04,564
We'll both be dead
by sunrise if we don't!

850
01:04:04,668 --> 01:04:06,675
Open the floor.

851
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:16,891
- It's gone!
- Move!

852
01:04:20,124 --> 01:04:22,491
Where is it?
Where did you put it?

853
01:04:22,587 --> 01:04:24,954
Maybe it slid to the back.

854
01:04:44,188 --> 01:04:45,595
The rear car is closed.

856
01:04:58,172 --> 01:05:00,026
- Where is it, Frankie?
- Huh?

857
01:05:00,123 --> 01:05:02,993
Where did you put it?
You took it.

858
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:04,593
I don't know
what you're talking about.

859
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,936
Hey, I know you have it!
You're the only one else with a key!

860
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:09,207
- Miles...
