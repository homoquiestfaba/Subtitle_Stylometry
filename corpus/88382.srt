1
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,595
That the guy?

2
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,943
That's the guy.

3
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,139
Does he get
to screw her first?

4
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:25,412
Sure. She can be coming
and going at the same time.

5
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,069
What's your poison?

6
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,505
Saucer of milk.

7
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,702
This looks like a cathouse.

8
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,745
Think of it as a kennel.

9
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,712
Consider it thunk.

10
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,215
So...

11
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,254
How much is that doggie
in the window?

12
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,414
Which one?

13
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,220
Lot of mongrels, this place.

14
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,489
The one with the waggedy tail.

15
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:20,930
I do hope that doggie's
for sale.

16
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,632
Dee dum!

17
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,746
It's a crummy tune, mister.

18
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,010
But otherwise...

19
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,946
Otherwise?

20
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,787
I'm your fluffy little pooch.

21
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,024
What'd you say?

22
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,165
Okay, so you want to be a dog.

23
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:52,966
No, no, I just want to shit
on the sidewalk.

24
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:59,008
How much is that doggie
in the window?

25
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,277
The one with the waggley tail.

26
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,785
Hey. I like Patti Page.

27
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,719
But does she like you?

28
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,293
We're in business.

29
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,174
Come on, I got you,

30
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,799
- I got you.
- What are you, new?

31
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,901
Yeah, I been dealing
with you for three months.

32
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,045
Close the blinds.

33
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,547
All right, I'll get
the blinds in a minute

34
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,548
if you'll give me a second.

35
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,346
Close the fucking blinds!

36
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:48,052
That fuck.

37
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:51,756
Do you know who I am?

38
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,628
I'm the Singing Detective.

39
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:22,327
Quote, come on, exclamation mark
come on, comma, bitch,

40
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,421
exclamation mark,
unquote, he panted...

41
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,929
Come on!

42
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,936
Come on, bitch!

43
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,938
Oh, yeah, yeah!

44
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,740
Come on.

45
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,214
Oh, yeah.

46
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,250
Yeah.

47
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,545
He panted...

48
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,712
as he drove his...

49
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,690
throbbing... into her...

50
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,729
What the fuck you
trying to do?

51
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,565
Tear me open, what?

52
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,241
Is the water?
What is that?

53
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,406
What is that?

54
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,678
Let go! No!

55
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:02,186
I don't want
a parrot that talks

56
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:06,891
I don't want a bowl
of little fishies

57
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,799
He can't take a goldfish
for a walk

58
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:15,098
How much is that doggie
in the window?

59
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:20,908
The one with the waggley tail?

60
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,575
How much is that doggie
in the window?

61
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,778
I do hope that doggie's for sale

62
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,253
No...

63
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:33,622
That's wrong. That's my...

64
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:37,356
She's my...

65
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,490
Woman love, hey, hey, hey

66
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,567
Hey, woman love,
hey, hey, hey

67
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:45,025
Hey, woman love,
hey, hey, hey

68
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,540
Hey, woman love,
hey, hey, hey

69
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,338
Hey, woman love,
hey, hey, hey

70
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,313
Well, I went to my doctor
not so long ago

71
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,942
A-walkin' in a circle
and moanin' low

72
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,713
He looked at me and said,
"Good Lord above, son

73
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,346
You need a vaccination
of a-woman love"

74
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,355
You are... Mr...?

75
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,686
Dark.

76
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,055
Daniel Dark.
Very inflamed.

77
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,354
How are you feeling today?

78
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,486
Extensive lesions.

79
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,723
Temperature through the roof.
Difficult case.

80
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,561
We moved him to a private
room after several

81
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,567
disruptive outbursts.
How long have you had

82
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,830
psoriatic arthropathy...?

83
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,428
"Ow wrong?"

84
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,405
Since Pearl Harbor.

85
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,839
26 years.

86
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:23,898
And do you have
much movement

87
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,307
- in your joints?
- Not very...

88
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,868
Hydrocortisone injections
all major joints

89
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,880
including the toes.

90
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,915
And the history?

91
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,847
- Oh, initially, coal tar.
- Right.

92
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,044
- Then gold injections.
- Mm-hmm.

93
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,245
Butazolodin, Indomethocine.

94
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,252
Not successful.

95
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:38,222
The courses Prednisone,
Prednisolone,

96
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,657
lengthening.
PUVA, not successful.

97
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:41,658
Then Methotrexate

98
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,251
after positive liver biopsies.

99
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,559
Oh, well, then, excuse me.
Much nausea?

100
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,929
Do you, uh, vomit, yes, mm?

101
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,262
Y-yeah...

102
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:53,828
Induced neutrophenia.
Wart-like lesions.

103
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,601
Removed.
Withdrawn.

104
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,607
You're, uh...

105
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:57,608
he's hyper...

106
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,372
You're hyperventilating.

107
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,777
Um, are you experiencing some
kind of visual dislocations?

108
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,339
- Mind tripping?
- I think...

109
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,885
Oh, yesterday he said
there was a dog in the bed,

110
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,012
uh, chewing his ankles.

111
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,050
Okay, things are not good here.

112
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,558
Um, how do you feel about

113
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:15,889
Mr...

114
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,226
Dark, how would you feel about
one of the new Retinoids?

115
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,197
Hmm?

116
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,996
Lt... it-it wasn't my ankles.

117
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,401
It was chewing my balls.

118
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,902
I see.

119
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,805
But what I'm asking you is if
you understand the question...

120
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,504
No! I don't!

121
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,910
Because I have regressed into

122
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,177
the pathetic condition
of total dependency, Doc.

123
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,411
In short,
and in the vernacular,

124
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,577
I'm a fucking kid again.

125
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:41,915
The last time I had

126
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,252
to endure anything
this demeaning

127
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,814
was in my baby-buggy.

128
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:50,385
I was drooled over
by slobbering cretins...

129
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,930
- Mr. Dark!
- Who apparently escaped

130
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,522
from the local cuckoo house.

131
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,964
They thought they were
doctors and nurses.

132
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,001
What, uh...

133
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,167
what exactly did you, uh...

134
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,302
what'd you do for a-a living,
Mr., what, I forget his name...

135
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,607
Dark?

136
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,274
What did I do?

137
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,873
I'm an author.

138
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:15,078
Oh... oh.

139
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,849
I didn't realize...

140
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,050
Dan Dark.

141
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,490
Trash that doesn't sell.

142
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,822
Detective stories
about a gumshoe

143
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,555
who warbles.

144
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,563
Well, that sounds interesting.

145
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:26,893
Um, what... what...?

146
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,728
Hey, listen to me.

147
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:29,995
Please, please...

148
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,331
W-What is it?

149
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,965
Will you please listen?

150
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,142
I can't talk
lying flat out like this.

151
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:44,080
I need... help
to sit up, please.

152
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,481
Oh. Well, help him up.

153
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,212
You know, I-I really, um...

154
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:50,153
You understand,
I'm on a very tight schedule...

155
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,459
- Listen...
- There you go.

156
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,563
Listen... listen...

157
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,930
listen!

158
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,663
I'm no hero,
and I've reached the end.

159
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:05,726
Of what?

160
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:06,737
My tether.

161
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,774
Oh, come on!

162
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:09,933
F...!

163
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,409
I'd like...

164
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:16,642
Christ, I'd like
to get out of it, but I can't!

165
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,651
Listen! I can't s...
I can't stand it,

166
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,950
I really truly can't stand
any... more!

167
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,557
I can't get on top of it,
I can't think straight,

168
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,456
and I can't tell what is
from what isn't,

169
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,359
and if I don't tell someone,

170
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,090
if I don't admit it,
I'll never get out of it.

171
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:37,864
Oh, I'm sorry...

172
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,428
Oh, the shame.

173
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,337
The tears...

174
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:47,107
All this oozing, useless liquid,
it just hurts my... skin.

175
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:50,706
My face, and...

176
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,478
and when I laugh,
it hurts my jaw.

177
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,518
I'm a prisoner inside my...

178
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:56,655
...my own skin.

179
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,222
On the hop!

180
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,761
Librium.

181
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,761
Valium.

182
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,821
Antidepressants.

183
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,867
And the barbiturates,
of course.

184
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:22,140
Bah, bah, bah, bah

185
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,307
Bah, bah, bah, bah

186
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,544
Bah, bah, bah, bah

187
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,610
Bah, bah, bah, bah

188
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,918
At the hop

189
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,719
Well, you can rock it,
you can roll it

190
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,225
Do the stop
and even stroll it

191
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,090
- At the hop
- Hop, hop, hop, hop

192
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,720
When the record starts spinning

193
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,788
You calypso
when you chicken at the hop

194
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,196
Hop, hop, hop, hop

195
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,600
Do the dance sensation
that is sweeping the nation

196
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,763
- At the hop
- Hop, hop, hop, hop

197
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,103
Let's go to the hop

198
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,769
Let's go to the hop,
oh, baby

199
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,108
Let's go to the hop,
oh, baby

200
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,774
Let's go to the hop

201
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:01,218
Come on,
let's go to the hop

202
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,346
Well, you can swing it,
you can groove it

203
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,117
You can really start
to move it at the hop

204
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,852
Ah, ah, ah

205
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,393
Where the jockey
is the smoothest

206
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,157
And the music is the coolest
at the hop

207
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,564
All the cats and chicks
can get their kicks at the hop

208
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,329
Let's go!

209
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,064
Let's go to the hop

210
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,936
Let's go to the hop,
oh, baby

211
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,599
Let's go to the hop,
oh, baby

212
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,907
Let's go to the hop

213
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,846
Come on

214
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,075
Let's go to the hop

215
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,208
Let's go!

216
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,861
Bah, bah, bah, bah

217
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,233
Bah, bah, bah, bah

218
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,636
Bah, bah, bah, bah

219
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,971
Bah, bah, bah, bah

220
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:57,575
At the hop!

221
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:05,716
Well, there is an upside
to all this pain and...

222
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,218
I firmly believe that.

223
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,415
And...

224
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,950
Good morning.

225
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,900
Uh...

226
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,230
he's almost over the edge.

227
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,136
I think that Gibbon
should see him. Okay?

228
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,740
Pretty Nina was full of semen,
comma, and bath water, period.

229
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,249
But the pretty head...

230
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,909
that knew too much
was now emptied...

231
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,751
of its last
sad, little thought, period.

232
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,223
A lot of products.

233
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,427
Oh, lookee here.

234
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,258
Body cream.

235
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,264
Jesus.

236
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,266
Harem Nights.

237
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,266
Is it done?

238
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,633
This goo, you put it
under your armpits,

239
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,604
you beat your meat with it,
what?

240
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,867
- Shaddup.
- Hey.

241
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,670
Shaddup!

242
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,845
Ah.

243
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,047
Just like a dame.

244
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,814
Tough guys don't upchuck.

245
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:19,289
They half know that vomit
is a kind of sacrament.

246
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,451
Period.

247
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:30,063
How are we today?

248
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,899
Mm, I'm not too happy.

249
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,907
I don't... I don't
know about him.

250
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,909
What?

251
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,638
Or maybe you mean you.

252
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,701
What do you mean?

253
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:44,579
Well, how are we today?

254
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,743
See, you say, "we."

255
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,411
Who's the other guy?

256
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,148
It's just
a way of speaking.

257
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,746
Yeah, it's a medical way.

258
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:55,624
Assume loss of health
equals loss of brain cells.

259
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,629
Do you think you have
a positive attitude?

260
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:03,693
Don't... don't.

261
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,168
You're going to crack me up.

262
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:10,541
Well, that depends on whether
we're talking donuts you dunk

263
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,840
or black feminist lesbians.

264
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,313
I'm in favor of both,
up to a point.

265
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,009
You know, your illness,
to a large...

266
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:23,544
Will I be able to move
on my own three feet?

267
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:26,056
Will I hold a pen
or a tit again?

268
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,888
Never mind the rhetoric.

269
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,361
I can get that from
a doctor, Doctor.

270
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,058
I have seen a lot of patients
who are as bad as you are,

271
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,933
but not one of them has reacted
with such aggression.

272
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,130
What they do, sing madrigals?

273
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,638
Well, they don't act

274
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,504
like they've fallen
into a sewer.

275
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,476
Ah, see...

276
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,240
I thought you were
pushing tranquilizers.

277
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,908
I didn't realize you
had a deodorant in mind.

278
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,917
You should take them,
you know, the tranquilizers.

279
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:57,752
No! No, no and no.

280
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,553
How long are you going
to see your plight

281
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,527
through a blinding hot rage,
Mr. Dark? Hmm?

282
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,995
What do you live by?

283
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,193
What? Come on.

284
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,033
All right,
it's an embarrassing question,

285
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,835
but surely
there must be something

286
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:19,207
in a time of crises...

287
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,711
What do you believe in?

288
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,709
Genocide.

289
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:27,717
What?

290
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,048
Genocide.

291
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:32,887
Starting in Los Angeles and
working its way eastward.

292
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,051
I believe in so many things.

293
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,893
Infanticide, insecticide,

294
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,728
cy... anide, suicide,

295
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,563
AIDS...

296
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,693
Okay.

297
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,738
All right. Okay.

298
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:51,071
I put my faith in cholesterol,
caffeine, nicotine, alcohol,

299
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:54,909
President Bush,
carbon monoxide, masturbation,

300
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,245
nuclear first-strike,
the <i>Reader's Digest</i> and...

301
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:01,878
not properly labeling poisons.

302
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,011
Are you done?

303
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,282
But most of all,

304
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,848
Doc, most of all, I believe
in the one good thing

305
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,020
that comes hurtling
out of people's mouths.

306
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:15,032
Ralph. Vomit. Puke.

307
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,035
The Technicolor yawn.

308
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:19,536
Cookie dough!

309
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:20,867
There is a good man here.

310
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,702
- Uh-huh.
- He's new.

311
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,369
He's very alert
and sympathetic.

312
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,376
Dr. Gibbon.

313
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,879
Doctor... of what?

314
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:32,906
Skin, joints, zoology?

315
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,078
He's a psychotherapist.

316
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:38,180
Go fuck yourself!

317
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:46,556
You will never
get on top of your condition

318
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:50,568
until you deal
with your bitterness.

319
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,331
Start over.

320
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,134
Reassemble yourself.

321
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,608
Reassemble myself?

322
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,218
With what?

323
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,520
Many a tear has to fall

324
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,186
Do, do, do, do, do

325
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,695
- But it's all
- Do, do, do, do, do

326
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,254
In the game

327
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:25,531
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do

328
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,196
All in the wonderful game

329
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,365
Do, do, do, do, do

330
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:34,674
That we know as love

331
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:39,581
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do

332
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:45,556
You have words with him

333
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:52,359
And your future's
looking dim...

334
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,733
Sorry, guys, I need five.

335
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,396
The words are breaking my heart.

336
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,336
See you gators later.

337
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,135
In a while, reptile.

338
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,907
Dan Dark?

339
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,857
Is it you,
the guy I've been waiting for

340
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,520
ever since Sax
invented the phone?

341
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:26,393
Come on, are you the big cheese
with the fat contract

342
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,524
who just loves
the way I tickle a tune?

343
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,363
Sorry, no.

344
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,699
Yeah, that's right, trouble.

345
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,205
You're in trouble.

346
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,367
I'm told you can help me.

347
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,034
You get results.

348
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:42,046
Oh, I get the cases
the polite guys pass.

349
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,378
See, I get the jobs the guys
who don't sing don't get.

350
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,383
So, what's the story?

351
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,884
Who's the dame?

352
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,387
How do you know there's a dame?

353
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,390
There's always a dame.

354
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:58,452
Tell me, am I right...
or am I right?

355
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,056
There's always a dame.

356
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,726
Am I right, or am I right?

357
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:07,761
There's always a body, too.

358
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,103
Talking to yourself again?

359
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,948
I had on my best pajamas,

360
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:20,246
the ones with red stripes
and the blue forget-me-nots.

361
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,412
And I was powdered
under the armpits

362
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,182
and talculmed
between each toe

363
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,748
'cause a million bucks
was about to call

364
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,953
and I was ready for it.

365
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,587
I see.

366
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,097
High temperature again.

367
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,531
When she moved her lips

368
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:39,298
I felt like a tulip
in dry season

369
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,101
when the first raindrop
smacked into it.

370
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:45,143
I decided to open up.

371
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,339
Boy, was I green.

372
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,110
Or do I mean wet?

373
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,988
Come to grease me, did ya?

374
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,613
If you're ready.

375
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,683
As ready as a back axle.

376
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,891
Okay, let's get these off.

377
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,728
I'll try not to hurt.

378
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,994
Okay.

379
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,901
You look better.

380
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,342
Thanks.

381
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,244
Oh, cock.

382
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,752
Cock, do not crow!

383
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,253
Poor cock.

384
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,257
Do not stir.

385
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,850
Think of something boring.

386
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,919
Something very, very boring.

387
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,522
Oh. Quick.

388
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,162
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir
now brings you...

389
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,605
selections from
<i>The Sound of Music.</i>

390
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,735
Snoopy pictures on the wall.

391
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,245
Nine grain toast with...

392
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,976
reduced sugar marmalade. Oh!

393
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:01,210
Old baseball players.

394
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,776
Piña coladas!

395
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,115
Sorry, is it too hard?

396
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,885
Go. Fine.

397
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,017
Not... not too hard.

398
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,757
It's worst of all here,
inside your thighs.

399
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,560
Huh.

400
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,759
Organic pizza.

401
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,529
Bumper stickers that ask you
to honk for Jesus.

402
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:21,561
Worrying about whales
and, oh, God,

403
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,403
oh, what about
fucking baby seals?

404
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,238
Fortune cookie messages,

405
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,404
and... and denim accessories.

406
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,210
Oh, muppets and puppets!

407
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,750
Sorry, I...

408
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,378
I'll have to lift your penis now
to grease around it.

409
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,619
Bum, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum

410
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,124
Bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum

411
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,127
Bum, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum

412
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,060
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

413
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,963
Mr. Sandman

414
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,930
Bring me a dream

415
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,433
Bum, bum, bum, bum

416
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,096
Make him the cutest
that I've ever seen

417
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,570
Bum, bum, bum, bum

418
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:58,268
Give him two lips
like roses and clover

419
00:22:58,343 --> 00:22:59,605
Bum, bum, bum, bum

420
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:03,045
Then tell him that his
lonesome nights are over

421
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,083
Sandman

422
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,277
I'm so alone

423
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:08,478
Bum, bum, bum, bum

424
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,612
Don't have nobody
to call my own

425
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,350
Bum, bum, bum, bum

426
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,825
Please turn
on your magic beam

427
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:20,593
Mr. Sandman,
bring me a dream

428
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,826
Bum, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum

429
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,926
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum

430
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,233
Bum, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum

431
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,773
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum

432
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,775
Mr. Sandman

433
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,676
Bring me a dream

434
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,443
Make him the cutest
that I've ever seen

435
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,951
Give him the word
that I'm not a rover...

436
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:41,951
Sorry.

437
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,645
I'm going to have
to lift your penis

438
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:44,950
now to grease around it.

439
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,581
...his lonesome nights
are over

440
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,626
Sandman

441
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,820
I'm so alone

442
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:55,697
Don't have nobody
to call my own

443
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,894
Please turn on your magic beam

444
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,163
Ah!

445
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,713
I'm so sorry.

446
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,486
That's the one part of me
that still sort of functions.

447
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,022
We don't have to talk about it,
do we?

448
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,328
No.

449
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,199
They say she was with me that
night, but I swear to God...

450
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,567
Swear to something
you believe in, bud.

451
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:38,075
I swear on my mother's grave
Nina left me alive and unharmed.

452
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,371
That her name? The whore?

453
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:41,912
Why do you call her that?

454
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,915
Dog shit by another name
smells just as foul, pal,

455
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,076
and it sticks to the bottom
of your blue suede shoe

456
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,245
no matter what
you call it, okay?

457
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,913
You've stepped into
something nasty.

458
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,422
You want me to clean it up.

459
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,254
I want you to find out
what happened to her

460
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,487
after she left me...
and to prove nothing bad

461
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:57,755
happened to her
from my hands.

462
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,761
But it did.

463
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,798
What?

464
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,857
Wouldn't that be the way
her mother would see it?

465
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,528
Her mother,
for Christ's sakes?

466
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:09,199
You just swore on your mother's
grave, Mr. Binney.

467
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,707
I'm not hiring you

468
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,437
for a mouthful of cant
and humbug, Mr. Dark.

469
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,213
Maybe the cops are fixing
to fry you, Binney.

470
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,910
Maybe you're playing
some deeper game.

471
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,046
You're not a
nice guy, Dark.

472
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:25,885
Ah, but you'll pay me,
Binney...

473
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:29,222
and you'll pay me double
for the cant and the humbug.

474
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,522
Period.

475
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:33,393
Part of the service, period.

476
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:36,229
End paragraph.

477
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,082
All right, so, uh,

478
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,023
you're gonna wait for
him here, all right?

479
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:05,187
Yeah, all right.

480
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,561
Cuckoo man.

481
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:25,908
My book.

482
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:30,686
What's it doing here?

483
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:31,722
What's going on?

484
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,556
Your book, Mr. Dark.

485
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:37,890
Happened to pick up
a copy

486
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:38,895
the other day.

487
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,556
Oh, yeah? Where?

488
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,896
Fertilizer factory?

489
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,562
He said out of the side
of his mouth.

490
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,605
Gibbon. How are you,
Mr. Dark?

491
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:50,300
Can't... shake.

492
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,070
Oh, yes, of course.
I'm sorry.

493
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,077
And I wouldn't if I could.

494
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,737
I'm here under protest.

495
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,612
Well, I see. A kidnap.

496
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,355
Little men shouldn't sit

497
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,186
where their feet don't touch
the floor.

498
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,726
Makes me think
of nursery rhymes.

499
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:12,795
You don't want

500
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:13,853
to see me.

501
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,594
What sharpness. What perception.

502
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:21,196
And you don't like it at all
that I've got this.

503
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,762
It's full of clues.

504
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,207
No, it's full of pages.

505
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,073
Oh, but clues are what
you're supposed to find

506
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,544
in a detective story.

507
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,013
Am I right, or...
am I right?

508
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,718
Jesus. You're good.

509
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,914
I know clues are
supposed to lead you

510
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,683
to the killer, but, uh...

511
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:40,884
what if they reveal

512
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,893
the victim a little
more clearly?

513
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,895
You think you're being
interesting, don't you?

514
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:49,900
If this was a movie, you'd be
on the cutting room floor.

515
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,902
Does your book worry you?

516
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,403
I want to go back to my bed.

517
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,063
It's vivid and exciting there.

518
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,903
Well, you don't
have any visitors.

519
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,272
How do you know?

520
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,243
Well, does your wife
come and visit you, or...

521
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,108
- I'm not married.
- Or do you stop her when...?

522
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,340
I'm not married.

523
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,575
Oh, and period.

524
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:07,209
Oh, oh, yes, I see.

525
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,686
Stop it! Stop staring at me!

526
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:16,693
You've never seen
a human pizza before?

527
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:21,395
You... you don't like women,
do you?

528
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:27,371
Which ones? Young ones, old
ones, fat ones, faithful ones?

529
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,839
Virgins? Whores?
Try to be specific, Doc.

530
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:30,840
Maybe, maybe you think

531
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,171
you like 'em...

532
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:37,340
uh, but, uh, my guess is,
well, you don't like sex.

533
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,712
How do you spell that?

534
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,717
That's not a word
you see much nowadays.

535
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,275
You probably think you do.

536
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,253
Sex.

537
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:45,846
Well, we think about it

538
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,552
all the time... I know I do.

539
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:51,390
Oh, if-if-if I say "Fuck you,"

540
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,590
does that mean yes?

541
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:56,861
Well, isn't it clear

542
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,903
that you regard
sexual intercourse

543
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:03,304
with, uh... distaste
or... perhaps even

544
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:04,841
a little fear?

545
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,503
What, am I trapped in here
with a fruitcake?

546
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,672
Here, for example,
on page 116...

547
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,545
This is against
the Geneva Convention.

548
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,345
Oh, I-I'm just going
to read you a passage

549
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,350
out of your own book.

550
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,011
- No!
- No?

551
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,884
Shove it up your ass!

552
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:33,233
Just walkin' in the rain

553
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,732
Getting soakin' wet

554
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,508
Oh, no.

555
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,172
Torturin' my heart

556
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,716
Fucking...

557
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,242
By tryin' to forget

558
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,754
Dad, what's wrong?

559
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:52,949
Just walkin' in the rain

560
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:58,361
So alone and blue...

561
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:03,934
I don't wish to upset you,
Mr. Dark.

562
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,560
I'm just walkin' in the rain,
Doc.

563
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,400
I think you know
you need help.

564
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,736
Now, you're too aware
of your own condition

565
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,400
to deny it.

566
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,068
Just collecting raindrops.

567
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,408
Most chronic skin patients

568
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,415
are on tranquilizers
or antidepressants.

569
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,610
See, the skin is
very personal.

570
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,277
It's, uh, tempting

571
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,617
to believe that the
poisons of the mind

572
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:25,951
have somehow...

573
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:29,926
erupted onto the surface
of the skin.

574
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,588
"Unclean, unclean!" you shout,

575
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,794
ringing your leper's bell,
warding us all off.

576
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,697
That'll destroy you.

577
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,966
Yes, I think you know that,

578
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,598
or at least
part of you does.

579
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,109
You can be helped.

580
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,737
Yeah, with a Mickey Finn.

581
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,338
Now, why mimic that stuff?

582
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,474
What stuff?

583
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,074
That out-the-side
- of-your-mouth

584
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,244
kind of stuff.

585
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,288
That down-these-mean-streets
kind of stuff.

586
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,322
I'm sorry.

587
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,880
What kind of stuff?

588
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,895
You know, my feeling is that,
um...

589
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,830
now that... after I've read
some of your prose...

590
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,833
Ho, ho, hee, hee.

591
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,562
...my feeling is
that, uh, you didn't

592
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,605
start out to write in this way.

593
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,141
What would you
have preferred

594
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,199
to have written?

595
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:21,745
What, if I had the talent,
you mean?

596
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,043
No, of course I don't mean that.

597
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,241
No, go ahead, be a critic.

598
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,580
You got the face for it.

599
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,087
If you like, all right.

600
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,123
Uh, if you had the talent.

601
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,591
If I had the talent,

602
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,254
one-liners for Michael Jackson,
two-liners for Helen Keller,

603
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,923
if it wouldn't be stretching her
too much.

604
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,092
Maybe traffic citations
for Ted Kennedy.

605
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:44,759
Who knows?

606
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,497
It's just one word
after another.

607
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,596
That's where all the problems
of the world start:

608
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,767
The next goddamn word.

609
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,242
It's not incriminating.

610
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,778
What isn't?

611
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:59,215
Telling me what you
would prefer to write.

612
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,388
I would like to have praised
a loving God

613
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,394
and all His Loving Creation...

614
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:12,724
Yes.

615
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:15,322
...and to have seen...

616
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,062
hosts of translucent angels

617
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,900
ascending spinning shafts
of golden light

618
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:24,237
to the deep blue caverns
of heaven.

619
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,743
Hell, they'd all have
these massive titties,

620
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,472
wouldn't they?

621
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:32,949
Well, here's one part here
that doesn't seem to... fit in

622
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,143
with the rest.

623
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,185
Here it is.

624
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:39,747
"Mouth sucking,
wet and slack at mouth,

625
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:43,487
"tongue chafing against tongue,

626
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,495
"limb thrusting
upon limb...

627
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,463
skin rubbing at skin."

628
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:54,597
Hmm..."Faces contort and
stretch into a helpless leer,

629
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:59,769
"organs spurt out smelly stains
and sticky betrayals.

630
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,142
"This is the sweaty farce

631
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:03,874
out of which we are
brought into being..."

632
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,006
Okay, okay, enough.

633
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,414
"We are implicated
without choice

634
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,815
"in the slippery catastrophe

635
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,854
"of copulations that spatter us
into existence.

636
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:11,889
Okay!

637
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,220
"We are spat
out of fevered loins.

638
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,725
Okay.

639
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,226
"We are the by-blows
of grunts and pantings

640
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,661
"in a rumpled and
creaking bed.

641
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,096
Shut up, you
sadistic quack!

642
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,559
Welcome."

643
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:28,127
Hmm?

644
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,371
Yeah, the Milk of Paradise.

645
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,677
I can taste it now.

646
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:48,387
How much is that doggie
in the window?

647
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,597
The one
with the waggley tail

648
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:57,998
How much is that doggie
in the window?

649
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:03,899
I do hope
that doggie's for sale

650
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:08,536
I must take a trip
to California

651
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:11,878
And leave my poor sweetheart
alone...

652
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,883
"The Devil was alive
in his eyes,

653
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,782
"hot with hate.

654
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,378
"I felt that ice chink
against my spine.

655
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:21,084
Hell, I was staring
straight into..."

656
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:24,853
How much is that doggie...

657
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:31,893
Mark, he's going to see us.

658
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,061
No, Mark...

659
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,900
Stand out there,
he will see you.

660
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,234
Come on.

661
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,907
It's okay.

662
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,641
Let go, Betty.

663
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,945
I'm just scared is all.

664
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,918
What can he do?

665
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:51,955
Nothing.

666
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,580
We're partners anyway.

667
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,523
Says so on the sign.

668
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,391
Partners in peanuts.

669
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,523
Hmm...

670
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,126
Well, I'll take my piece
right now.

671
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,068
Don't say it like that.

672
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,106
Oh, now, you're just scared,

673
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,073
that's all.

674
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,709
God, I love your mouth

675
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,578
when you don't like
something I say.

676
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,588
Ain't nothin' to be scared of.

677
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:33,230
Nobody comes to this old barn
no more...

678
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,389
except the rats.

679
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,762
And you.

680
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,762
Hmm?

681
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,073
Sounds like you've
been here before.

682
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,440
Me? What for?

683
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,612
Who with?

684
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:57,785
You are no good, Mark.

685
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:04,687
What about you...

686
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,559
Mrs. Dark?

687
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,100
Oh!

688
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,097
Oh.

689
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,599
Angel.

690
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,740
Here.

691
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,910
Come on, bitch.

692
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:06,488
Tongue chafing against tongue,

693
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,991
limb thrusting upon limb,

694
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,995
skin rubbing at skin.

695
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:16,500
Faces contort and stretch
into a helpless leer.

696
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:21,766
Organs spurt out smelly stains
and...

697
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,807
Sticky betrayals.

698
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:35,115
Just walking in the rain

699
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:40,317
Getting soaking wet

700
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:44,521
Torturing my heart

701
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:49,464
By trying to forget

702
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:54,698
Just walking in the rain

703
00:37:54,772 --> 00:38:00,142
So alone and blue

704
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,405
All because my heart

705
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,003
He's still waving.

706
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,480
Dad just kept waving.

707
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:07,346
- Still remembers you...
- What?

708
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,046
I said, how far is it?

709
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,887
About 200 miles.

710
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,904
Will we like it...

711
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,007
Los Angeles?

712
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,909
Mom?

713
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,377
Lt'll be dark

714
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,415
and full of gangsters.

715
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:04,397
I'm afraid
he had to be sedated.

716
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,308
He's been asleep
most of the day.

717
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,881
The poor man.

718
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,983
They're trying him
on a new drug,

719
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,610
but you know that, of course.

720
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,018
Of course.

721
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:21,889
Mr. Dark?

722
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,084
Your wife.

723
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,252
You know what, I...

724
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,387
Maybe we shouldn't wake him.

725
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,361
They wanted to know if you came.

726
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:35,905
The doctors.

727
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,066
They'd like to speak with you.

728
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,007
Well, yeah, maybe
I-I should speak to somebody.

729
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:41,009
I mean, at least I won't

730
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:42,272
get my head bitten off.

731
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,280
Sorry?

732
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:47,078
Oh, uh, if he wakes up
and sees me here,

733
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,743
you'll know what I mean.

734
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:53,916
It's... Dan Dark, Darker,
Darkest, kind of his thing.

735
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:56,858
Actually,
I'm-I'm going to go. I...

736
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,088
I think
I shouldn't have come.

737
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,688
I just...
I shouldn't even try.

738
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,893
Wait. Please...

739
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,266
Farewell, my lovely.

740
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,369
You bitch!

741
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,934
Nicola!

742
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,840
Come here, you disgusting tramp!

743
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,111
You two-bit slag bitch!

744
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,482
Nicola!

745
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:26,182
Who are you
spreading your legs for now?

746
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:30,722
Come back here now,
you stupid

747
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:31,921
bitch whore cunt!

748
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:34,157
Mr. Dark, what do you
think you're doing?

749
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,426
Where do you
think you are?

750
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:39,929
I'm so sorry.

751
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,164
Is there a problem?

752
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,172
Yes, there's
a problem.

753
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,901
You're the problem.

754
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,374
Stop the yelling.

755
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,570
It's disgusting.

756
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:48,976
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

757
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:49,977
You stop it at once!

758
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,277
I so don't want
to be disruptive.

759
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,442
Good.

760
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,315
I was just sort of singing.

761
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:57,945
You were what?

762
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:02,925
Many a tear has to fall

763
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:08,088
But it's all in the game.

764
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:32,111
Ah, there are mysteries,
puzzles.

765
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:33,816
There are always things

766
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,483
that bewilder us
as children, Mr. Dark.

767
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,617
Mmm.

768
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:37,626
Accept it. Yes?

769
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:38,627
Mmm.

770
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,630
Accept the sky,
accept the birds.

771
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,188
Accept bird shit.

772
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,501
Has your wife been
to visit you yet?

773
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,130
God, the way you walk
up and down behind me.

774
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,606
I mean, are you pretending
to be an oddball,

775
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,939
or are you actually nuts?

776
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,241
Ah, there you are.

777
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,213
You're looking better.

778
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,648
Uh-huh. Am I?

779
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,345
Yeah. Your posture, too.

780
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:03,511
- Great.
- Less pain?

781
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,384
Yeah, maybe.

782
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,754
Well, you know, you-you ought
to let those neck muscles

783
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,292
...relax a little.

784
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,123
Oh, I'm sorry.
Forgive me. I, uh...

785
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,127
God.

786
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,458
Well, that's why I...

787
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,828
Well, look, I just...

788
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,594
If you could just
turn your head.

789
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,931
Uh, you'd-you'd get
fewer headaches that way.

790
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,595
Who says I get headaches?

791
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:22,070
Oh, you do,
don't you?

792
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:24,232
Severe ones, hmm?

793
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:25,900
And no doubt, as a result,

794
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:28,501
your perceptions are probably
somewhat distorted, hmm?

795
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,308
Yeah. I can see around corners

796
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,474
and right up
your hairy little self.

797
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,541
Not to mention that
ugly temper, yeah.

798
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,781
Minute by minute,
we make the world, Doc.

799
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,345
Our own world.

800
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:41,516
Hmm.

801
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:42,854
Well, what do you think?

802
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:46,727
You think it's time maybe
you went back to work again?

803
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:50,358
Tell me how, Dr. Donothing.

804
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:52,368
Well, I never write
anything down myself.

805
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:54,734
I dictate.
Never tried it.

806
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:56,966
With whom?
Question mark.

807
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,975
Well, there are people.

808
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,135
Agencies.

809
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,575
Has somebody been getting
to you?

810
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:02,873
What do you mean?

811
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,347
Has a certain whore

812
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:09,113
of my former acquaintance been
pushing her hard little nose

813
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:12,019
into my affairs?

814
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,887
Mr. Dark,

815
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:17,427
do you plan
to get better?

816
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,792
Hmm?

817
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:23,890
Chronic illness
is a shelter. Yeah.

818
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,902
A cave in the rocks

819
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,133
into which a wounded
spirit can safely crawl.

820
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:30,264
Some cave.

821
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:31,273
Oh, no, no, no.

822
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:32,274
Not very comfortable,

823
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,275
not at all.

824
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:34,777
No. There are bats in it. Mmm.

825
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,779
Squeaking rodents

826
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:39,441
with wings of skin and fur,

827
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:40,915
that hang upside down,

828
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:43,215
crunching beetles
in their teeth.

829
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,811
But you know all about that.

830
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:45,946
You know about bats.

831
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,081
Shut up, shrimp.

832
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:49,757
You turned, you turned!

833
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:52,460
I did.

834
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:54,896
I did.

835
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,933
Not now. No. Go.

836
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,427
Who was that?

837
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,471
Huh?

838
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,335
What's that?
That's progress, Mr. Dark.

839
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:04,567
Progress.

840
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,542
Who knows how far it can go.

841
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,176
Oh, from the neck down,
you mean.

842
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:10,372
Hmm?

843
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,108
If you're thinking
the other way around,

844
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:13,581
if you want to
get inside my head,

845
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,676
you better forget it.

846
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:18,244
Hmm. Good.

847
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,938
Wait. You...

848
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,066
He's asleep.

849
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,905
- Who is?
- My boy.

850
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,774
You mean you got a kid in here?

851
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:42,937
Jesus.

852
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,844
Shh, shh, shh.
Not so loud.

853
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,941
Listen, doll, when I fuck,
I like to make a noise, okay?

854
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,677
All right, all right.

855
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:50,913
Come on.

856
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,717
This way. It's okay.

857
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,782
Here we go.

858
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:06,200
What a disgusting disease.

859
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,397
Gee, thanks.

860
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:14,774
Dan. I don't...

861
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:16,870
No, no, no. Sit down,
sit down. Why not?

862
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,471
Keep the laughs coming.

863
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,676
Who's laughing?

864
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,184
You are beyond the
shadow of a doubt

865
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,285
an exceptionally
beautiful woman.

866
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:35,923
At your peak.

867
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,626
That sounds like
a death sentence.

868
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,226
It is a death sentence.

869
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:41,396
Dan, listen...

870
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,337
Three months I've been
in this fucking bed.

871
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,567
You know that?

872
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:45,938
Where you been?

873
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,236
Who are you? What are you?

874
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:48,505
I don't know.

875
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,638
I hallucinate now and then.

876
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:51,840
Ain't that a laugh?

877
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,712
The past, the present...
they're all in that

878
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:57,242
cheap old book of mine,
and I didn't even know it.

879
00:45:58,756 --> 00:45:59,916
So are you, honey.

880
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,651
- Me?
- Uh-huh.

881
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:03,659
Nicola.

882
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,323
Yeah.

883
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:11,390
You are a filthy,

884
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:14,437
predatory, totally wanton bitch
who is always in heat,

885
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:16,632
and I don't want you near me.

886
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:18,299
I don't.

887
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,467
I don't. Not now.

888
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,670
I don't. Not ever.

889
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,942
What if I said
I still loved you?

890
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,616
Liar.

891
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,259
I have some things
to discuss with you.

892
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:44,323
There's a film company
that wants to buy the rights

893
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:47,063
to that first book.

894
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,229
What?

895
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,602
<i>The Singing Detective.</i>

896
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:51,732
The one set in the '50s.

897
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,777
Is that the book
you've been talking about?

898
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,040
They want it
for Roger Rabbit, right?

899
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,445
No.

900
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:01,643
They seem, um...

901
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:02,878
keen.

902
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,181
Keen?

903
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:09,214
Hey, what's this got to do
with you?

904
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:10,726
You're broke,

905
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:13,422
and you haven't written a word
for over a year.

906
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:17,900
I mean, Danny,
I just want you to be able

907
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,366
to support yourself.

908
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,370
Oh, God, I see.

909
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:24,896
Baby, Baby... still thinks
I owe her money.

910
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,340
No.

911
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,900
You could work
it out at, say,

912
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,672
$500 a screw.

913
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:32,214
Isn't that top rate for hookers?

914
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:35,209
Is it?

915
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,775
I wouldn't know.

916
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:41,150
Who are you sleeping with
at the moment?

917
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,460
Myself, mostly.

918
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,930
Mostly?

919
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,933
Mostly.

920
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:53,161
Mostly means not always.

921
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:56,070
Right, if you want
to be precise.

922
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:03,840
Dan...

923
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:06,007
you need to function.

924
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,074
You just...
you need to get your hand

925
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:09,277
on that old book...

926
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,253
What happened to the screenplay?
Where is it?

927
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,811
What screenplay?

928
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,414
The one in my head.

929
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:16,618
What are you talking about?

930
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:17,785
That is the
worst thing

931
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:19,795
about a detective
story is the plot.

932
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:21,854
It's the best thing, too.

933
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:23,331
I mean, hell,
isn't it really...?

934
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,197
It's just... it's
the only thing.

935
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,203
You got to work it out
like a rat in a maze.

936
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:29,205
That's what I'm trying to do
right now.

937
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:32,401
Yeah, but with a story
you've already written?

938
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,376
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

939
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:36,571
It grows.

940
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:41,482
How... when you already know
what's going to happen?

941
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:43,280
Where is it?!

942
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:44,342
Where is what?

943
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,389
The fucking screenplay...
<i>The Singing Detective.</i>

944
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:48,185
I wrote it years ago;
I put in shoe boxes.

945
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,122
Shoe boxes?

946
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:52,889
Yes! Fucking shoe boxes!

947
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,563
Danny...

948
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,967
I know.

949
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,835
Boy, do I know.

950
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:17,843
Dan...

951
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:20,446
You need to write
something new.

952
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:21,582
Something real.

953
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:22,818
Like what?

954
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:23,882
Like this, like everything

955
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,326
that's happening right now.

956
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:26,862
Not a silly detective story.

957
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:27,988
Something real.

958
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,464
Ah, solutions.

959
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:30,591
What?

960
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,294
All solutions

961
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:34,599
and no clues, right?

962
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:36,696
'Cause that's
what the dumbheads want.

963
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:39,674
They want the serious novel,
right?

964
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:43,474
Plus descriptions
of the goddamn sky.

965
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:45,242
I want it
the other way around.

966
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,839
All clues, no solutions,

967
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:51,217
'cause that's the way...
things are.

968
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:53,654
Now...

969
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,790
Why do you know about this?

970
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:02,593
Why do you know?
Tell me.

971
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:06,500
Were you a party to the offer
in the first place?

972
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,094
Tell me what's going on.

973
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,833
Tell me.

974
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:12,738
Tell me!

975
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,245
Paranoia. I don't...

976
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:21,243
Or theft.

977
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,809
Danny, stop.

978
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:25,115
Do you want my help or not?

979
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,712
Do I want your help?

980
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,724
Do I want you to help me?

981
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,623
Well, you think on it.

982
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,924
Okay. You go fuck yourself.

983
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:35,521
Okay. I love you too, Danny.

984
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:52,948
Hey, Binney.

985
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,952
Quote, no luck, period.

986
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,282
No good, period.

987
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:01,051
He was getting very suspicious,
exclamation mark.

988
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:02,489
No luck. No good.

989
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:05,356
He's getting very suspicious.

990
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:08,125
But you'll try again, right?

991
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:09,859
I-I don't know.

992
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,730
But we could be sued

993
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:14,236
for misrepresentation
if he doesn't sign.

994
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:16,067
I'll deliver.
I said I would.

995
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,369
He still looks awful.

996
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,137
Don't start feeling
sorry for him.

997
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,905
I don't. I hope
it goes right into

998
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:23,707
his fucking bones.

999
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:28,913
You look terrific
when you're mad.

1000
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,612
Just like a hornet...

1001
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,087
drowning in the Tabasco.

1002
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:35,852
That's something
Dan Dark would say.

1003
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,587
You sound like Dan.

1004
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,957
Sorry, Charlie.

1005
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:48,799
How much is that doggie
in the window?

1006
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,508
The one with the waggley tail

1007
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:57,103
How much is that doggie
in the window...?

1008
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:07,823
She comes on like a rose

1009
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:11,224
But everybody knows

1010
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,229
She'll get you in Dutch

1011
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:17,664
You can look,
but you better not touch

1012
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:19,827
Poison ivy...

1013
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:21,632
There are songs to sing.

1014
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,696
There are feelings to feel.

1015
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:25,331
There are thoughts to think.

1016
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:27,342
That makes three things.

1017
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,810
You can't do three things
at the same time.

1018
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,814
...creepin' around...

1019
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:34,180
The singing is easy...
sugar on the tongue.

1020
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:35,912
The thinking
comes with the tune.

1021
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,715
So, that
leaves only the feelings,

1022
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:39,220
and you're not going
to catch me

1023
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:42,190
feeling the feeling.
No, sir.

1024
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:45,456
...lf you let her
get under your skin

1025
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:48,965
Poison ivy...

1026
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:52,831
Watch the light, dickhead.

1027
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:55,201
...Late at night
while you're sleepin'

1028
00:52:55,272 --> 00:53:00,335
Poison ivy
comes a-creepin' around

1029
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,573
Measles make you bumpy,
and mumps'll make you lumpy

1030
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:06,275
And chicken pox'll
make you jump and twitch...

1031
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,010
The guy's a sitting duck.

1032
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:10,177
But why here?

1033
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:11,379
What's the sense?

1034
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:13,285
J. Edgar H. Prefers a
different kind of tune.

1035
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,620
What does it matter?

1036
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,183
Well, I don't like it.

1037
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:20,126
Stick to Patti Page, eh?

1038
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,392
Up there with the lights...
it's the goons.

1039
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:24,399
Watch yourself! Watch!

1040
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:27,265
...The minute
you start to mess around...

1041
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:22,925
How's it going?

1042
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:24,891
Halfway there.

1043
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,860
Halfway to a million bucks.

1044
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:40,943
With disdain.

1045
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:44,103
Period.

1046
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:47,115
I have some nice things,
if that's what you mean.

1047
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,172
Nice, no.

1048
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:49,741
Expensive, I said.

1049
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:51,150
Tastes differ.

1050
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:55,783
You're more at home in... bars
and sleazy dance halls.

1051
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:56,951
Oh, I...

1052
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:59,291
do the occasional
Rotary dinner,

1053
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:01,455
state prison dance...

1054
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:03,396
where I don't leave my hat.

1055
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:06,892
What?

1056
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,665
That's how the cops
got onto you, Binney.

1057
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:12,435
You left your fedora on the bar
when you picked up that whore.

1058
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,480
Money.

1059
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:24,345
Money, money, money.

1060
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:26,286
What about it?

1061
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:27,414
You got a lot.

1062
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,718
I do all right.

1063
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:32,319
What at, I'm wondering.

1064
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:34,761
I buy, I sell.

1065
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,595
Uh-huh. So does
Second Hand Rose.

1066
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,032
What do you buy?

1067
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,592
What do you sell?

1068
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,762
That's my business.

1069
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,204
Naked flesh?

1070
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:45,673
What?

1071
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,107
Oh, yeah, that's
what you buy,

1072
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,166
that's what you sell.

1073
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:50,041
That's ridiculous.

1074
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,774
I deal in antiques,
if you must know.

1075
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,475
The only antiques are some of
the distinguished gentlemen

1076
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,644
you service with
young girls, Binney.

1077
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,449
Are you calling me a...?

1078
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,547
A pimp? Why, yes, you
don't mind, do you?

1079
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,585
You're a fantasist,
Dark.

1080
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,726
Get out.

1081
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,097
Don't let me see you again.

1082
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:13,226
What about my fee?

1083
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:14,895
Fee? What fee?

1084
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,506
It took me five days
between my syncopations

1085
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:20,372
to figure out that you set up
that poor girl, Nina.

1086
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:22,911
Why? I said to myself, "Why?"

1087
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,139
Just get out.

1088
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,239
You know what I think?

1089
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:27,613
I think she was
killed right here

1090
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,049
in this museum.

1091
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,916
You're crazy.

1092
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,817
But it's not the cops
you're scared of, Binney.

1093
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:33,821
They can be bought and sold,
too.

1094
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:34,914
Put it back in the drawer,
will you?

1095
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:38,323
- What?
- Put it back in the drawer,

1096
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,488
unless you want a hole
between your eyes

1097
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,157
that the wind from your ass
can whistle through.

1098
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:46,259
You really are crazy.

1099
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:48,167
Out of your cheap little mind.

1100
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,433
Sure. But do it.

1101
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:53,271
I've been shot at once tonight,

1102
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:55,140
and that's once too often.

1103
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:57,975
Okay, okay.

1104
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,788
This Nina... she wasn't
one of your commodities.

1105
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:08,585
- But her friend was.
- What friend?

1106
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:11,218
That girl they scraped up
under the Hollywood sign.

1107
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:12,488
The cops say she jumped.

1108
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:13,620
But your pals...

1109
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:14,685
What pals?

1110
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:15,731
Your pals thought

1111
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,528
she might have passed
something on to Nina,

1112
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,862
and they were taking no chances.

1113
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,027
Not with her, not with you.

1114
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,161
Am I right, or am I right?

1115
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,331
And now they want me, too,

1116
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:26,068
you slimy slug.

1117
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:31,543
Go on.

1118
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,842
Go on.
I enjoy cheap fiction.

1119
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:37,284
Me? Nah.

1120
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:39,821
I'm no longer in your employ.

1121
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:41,049
Fee? What fee?

1122
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,113
You hired me

1123
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:43,159
to find out
what happened to Nina

1124
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:44,215
when you already knew.

1125
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:48,890
Why? I'll figure it out. And...

1126
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,832
And?

1127
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:54,301
I sing for people
who dance, Binney.

1128
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:57,134
Name your tune,
I'll warble it for you,

1129
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:58,731
but when you dance...

1130
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:01,072
your feet
won't be touching the floor.

1131
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,169
Oh, you're cheap, Dark.

1132
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:06,477
Ten cents a dance.

1133
00:59:23,424 --> 00:59:24,789
Mr. Dark?

1134
00:59:28,095 --> 00:59:29,528
That's my handle.

1135
00:59:29,597 --> 00:59:31,690
I was born at daybreak.

1136
00:59:31,766 --> 00:59:33,233
Please, I want to talk.

1137
00:59:33,301 --> 00:59:34,393
You followed me

1138
00:59:34,468 --> 00:59:36,197
to make sure I wasn't followed,
but I was.

1139
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:39,034
Stay back. Keep
out of sight.

1140
00:59:39,106 --> 00:59:41,574
Meet me at The Laguna
in a half an hour.

1141
00:59:43,444 --> 00:59:44,877
Little fool.

1142
01:00:03,297 --> 01:00:05,765
I warned you.

1143
01:00:05,833 --> 01:00:07,596
I told you, baby.

1144
01:00:11,606 --> 01:00:13,233
Ah, gee.

1145
01:00:13,307 --> 01:00:16,799
Silly... poor little thing.

1146
01:00:16,877 --> 01:00:18,777
Parlow.

1147
01:00:21,649 --> 01:00:22,741
What?

1148
01:00:22,817 --> 01:00:25,411
You mean,
the Parlow Atomic Laboratory...

1149
01:00:25,486 --> 01:00:27,113
here in L.A.?

1150
01:00:28,189 --> 01:00:29,588
Binney...

1151
01:00:29,657 --> 01:00:31,022
Mark Binney.

1152
01:00:32,994 --> 01:00:35,929
He's providing all the girls.

1153
01:00:35,997 --> 01:00:38,932
Right? Girls like you...

1154
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,627
like Nina.

1155
01:00:42,003 --> 01:00:44,096
The Reds.

1156
01:00:44,171 --> 01:00:48,107
They're getting
to the atomic scientists...

1157
01:00:48,175 --> 01:00:49,267
Yes?

1158
01:00:49,343 --> 01:00:51,106
At Parlow?

1159
01:00:51,178 --> 01:00:52,941
Using sex.

1160
01:00:55,683 --> 01:00:57,651
Sex.

1161
01:01:06,794 --> 01:01:08,921
Sex.

1162
01:01:16,971 --> 01:01:19,235
Sex.

1163
01:01:19,306 --> 01:01:22,571
I'll get ya.

1164
01:01:22,643 --> 01:01:24,736
Bastards.

1165
01:01:24,812 --> 01:01:28,908
Whoever you are,
and whatever you are...

1166
01:01:28,983 --> 01:01:31,611
wherever you are.

1167
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:52,605
You're buffeted by this...

1168
01:01:52,673 --> 01:01:54,937
by that, and it's nothing
to do with you.

1169
01:01:55,009 --> 01:01:57,773
You know,
someone you love dies or leaves.

1170
01:01:57,845 --> 01:01:59,904
Then you get ill,
or you get better,

1171
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,811
and the whole time, everywhere,

1172
01:02:01,882 --> 01:02:04,874
there's just this canopy
stretching out over you...

1173
01:02:04,952 --> 01:02:06,920
What canopy?

1174
01:02:07,021 --> 01:02:09,251
Fate... things as they are.

1175
01:02:09,323 --> 01:02:11,518
It's irrational,
impersonal.

1176
01:02:11,592 --> 01:02:15,392
The rain falls,
the sun shines, the wind blows,

1177
01:02:15,463 --> 01:02:18,227
and if you're out there in it,
that's it.

1178
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:20,290
Things.

1179
01:02:20,367 --> 01:02:23,359
Accident.

1180
01:02:23,437 --> 01:02:24,495
Call it what you like.

1181
01:02:24,572 --> 01:02:26,597
There's damn all
you can do about it.

1182
01:02:31,312 --> 01:02:34,247
Well, physically,
you're on the up.

1183
01:02:34,315 --> 01:02:36,510
Well...

1184
01:02:36,584 --> 01:02:38,745
Now we have a firm
grasp of the obvious.

1185
01:02:38,819 --> 01:02:41,253
Why do you still feel
so disappointed

1186
01:02:41,322 --> 01:02:43,847
in things as they are?

1187
01:02:43,924 --> 01:02:46,757
Things as they are...

1188
01:02:46,827 --> 01:02:48,954
no concern of mine.

1189
01:02:49,096 --> 01:02:51,860
You object to the use
of the word "things"?

1190
01:02:51,932 --> 01:02:53,797
Oh, there's a lot of words
I don't like.

1191
01:02:53,868 --> 01:02:55,699
Such as?

1192
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:58,500
Decaffeinated.

1193
01:02:58,572 --> 01:03:00,506
Hmm.

1194
01:03:00,574 --> 01:03:01,700
Another?

1195
01:03:01,776 --> 01:03:04,370
Oh, good, good, good.
Indoor games.

1196
01:03:04,445 --> 01:03:05,377
Yeah.

1197
01:03:05,446 --> 01:03:07,073
- Word games?
- Yeah, sure.

1198
01:03:07,148 --> 01:03:08,137
I throw you a word, you...

1199
01:03:08,215 --> 01:03:09,375
I come back with
another word.

1200
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:11,384
Yeah, that you associate
with the word that I...

1201
01:03:11,452 --> 01:03:14,717
Okay, wait-wait-wait-wait, yeah,
but we got to... agree...

1202
01:03:14,789 --> 01:03:16,723
in advance
that it's meaningless.

1203
01:03:16,791 --> 01:03:19,658
Please, there's no diagnostic
value for any of it.

1204
01:03:19,727 --> 01:03:22,560
Fine.

1205
01:03:23,631 --> 01:03:25,030
Judge.

1206
01:03:25,099 --> 01:03:27,863
Oh, skin.

1207
01:03:27,935 --> 01:03:28,902
Scales.

1208
01:03:28,969 --> 01:03:30,061
Weight.

1209
01:03:30,137 --> 01:03:31,536
Tables.

1210
01:03:31,605 --> 01:03:33,266
Restaurant.

1211
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,900
Gastroenteritis.

1212
01:03:35,976 --> 01:03:36,943
Honey.

1213
01:03:37,077 --> 01:03:38,169
Comb.

1214
01:03:38,245 --> 01:03:39,177
Blonde.

1215
01:03:39,246 --> 01:03:40,178
Honey.

1216
01:03:40,247 --> 01:03:41,043
Money.

1217
01:03:41,115 --> 01:03:42,241
Shit.

1218
01:03:42,316 --> 01:03:43,442
You.

1219
01:03:43,517 --> 01:03:44,381
Me?

1220
01:03:44,451 --> 01:03:45,042
Me.

1221
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,177
Tarzan.

1222
01:03:46,253 --> 01:03:47,413
Jungle.

1223
01:03:47,488 --> 01:03:48,580
Manhattan.

1224
01:03:48,656 --> 01:03:50,089
- Mugger.
- Baghdad.

1225
01:03:50,157 --> 01:03:51,249
Arms.

1226
01:03:51,325 --> 01:03:53,054
- Hands.
- Clap.

1227
01:03:53,127 --> 01:03:55,095
Promiscuity.

1228
01:03:55,162 --> 01:03:56,220
- Free.
- Gift.

1229
01:03:56,297 --> 01:03:57,924
Giver.

1230
01:03:57,998 --> 01:03:59,795
- Sucker.
- Mouth.

1231
01:03:59,867 --> 01:04:01,061
Fangs.

1232
01:04:01,135 --> 01:04:01,624
Wolf.

1233
01:04:01,702 --> 01:04:02,634
Whistle.

1234
01:04:02,703 --> 01:04:04,227
- Scream.
- Silence.

1235
01:04:04,305 --> 01:04:05,431
Young.

1236
01:04:05,506 --> 01:04:06,530
Green.

1237
01:04:06,607 --> 01:04:07,699
Old.

1238
01:04:07,775 --> 01:04:09,572
Mm... Mick Jagger.

1239
01:04:09,643 --> 01:04:10,871
Rock.

1240
01:04:10,945 --> 01:04:12,207
Cradle.

1241
01:04:12,279 --> 01:04:13,405
- Crash.
- Dream.

1242
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,072
Wake.

1243
01:04:15,149 --> 01:04:16,138
Sleep.

1244
01:04:16,217 --> 01:04:17,309
Lie.

1245
01:04:17,384 --> 01:04:18,476
Tale.

1246
01:04:18,552 --> 01:04:20,247
- Writer.
- Liar.

1247
01:04:20,321 --> 01:04:21,151
Sentence.

1248
01:04:21,222 --> 01:04:22,154
Prison.

1249
01:04:22,223 --> 01:04:23,884
Cage.

1250
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:25,050
Barn.

1251
01:04:25,125 --> 01:04:26,092
Mother.

1252
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,128
M... murder.

1253
01:04:28,195 --> 01:04:29,287
Love.

1254
01:04:29,363 --> 01:04:30,125
Fraud.

1255
01:04:30,197 --> 01:04:30,925
Passion.

1256
01:04:30,998 --> 01:04:31,589
Pretense.

1257
01:04:31,665 --> 01:04:32,290
Woman.

1258
01:04:32,366 --> 01:04:32,889
Fuck!

1259
01:04:32,967 --> 01:04:33,296
Fuck.

1260
01:04:33,367 --> 01:04:33,924
Dirt!

1261
01:04:34,068 --> 01:04:34,500
Dirt.

1262
01:04:34,568 --> 01:04:35,057
Death!

1263
01:04:35,135 --> 01:04:35,499
Start.

1264
01:04:35,569 --> 01:04:37,560
Stop!

1265
01:04:42,676 --> 01:04:44,940
Oh, nice game.

1266
01:04:47,648 --> 01:04:49,741
It's just words, right?

1267
01:04:49,817 --> 01:04:51,478
That's what we agreed.

1268
01:04:51,552 --> 01:04:53,247
No diagnostic value.

1269
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,810
Just words.

1270
01:04:55,823 --> 01:04:59,156
Important words

1271
01:04:59,226 --> 01:05:02,354
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

1272
01:05:02,429 --> 01:05:05,159
That mean a lot

1273
01:05:05,232 --> 01:05:10,670
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh...

1274
01:05:10,738 --> 01:05:15,641
They say... say

1275
01:05:15,709 --> 01:05:18,610
I love you

1276
01:05:18,679 --> 01:05:21,045
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

1277
01:05:21,115 --> 01:05:24,016
Important words

1278
01:05:24,084 --> 01:05:27,542
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

1279
01:05:27,621 --> 01:05:30,317
That's all I've got

1280
01:05:30,391 --> 01:05:35,385
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh...

1281
01:05:35,462 --> 01:05:40,559
They say, say

1282
01:05:40,634 --> 01:05:43,228
I love you...

1283
01:05:43,304 --> 01:05:46,068
I'll do whatever you want...
okay?

1284
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:48,131
You just have
to tell me.

1285
01:05:48,208 --> 01:05:50,904
The days, the nights

1286
01:05:50,978 --> 01:05:54,038
The hours

1287
01:05:54,114 --> 01:06:00,747
We spent makin' plans...

1288
01:06:00,821 --> 01:06:02,345
- Love.
- Fraud.

1289
01:06:02,423 --> 01:06:03,515
- Passion.
- Pretense.

1290
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:04,852
- Woman.
- Fuck!

1291
01:06:04,925 --> 01:06:06,017
- Fuck.
- Dirt!

1292
01:06:06,093 --> 01:06:07,355
- Dirt.
- Death.

1293
01:06:07,428 --> 01:06:10,864
Since we first held hands

1294
01:06:10,931 --> 01:06:14,867
lmportant words

1295
01:06:14,935 --> 01:06:16,596
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

1296
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:19,696
They say I love you

1297
01:06:19,773 --> 01:06:21,206
Mom?

1298
01:06:21,275 --> 01:06:24,711
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

1299
01:06:24,778 --> 01:06:25,710
Go back to bed.

1300
01:06:25,779 --> 01:06:29,044
They say, say

1301
01:06:29,116 --> 01:06:30,048
Go.

1302
01:06:30,117 --> 01:06:32,881
I do

1303
01:06:32,953 --> 01:06:37,447
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1304
01:06:37,524 --> 01:06:42,427
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...

1305
01:06:45,933 --> 01:06:48,629
Why, Mom, why?

1306
01:06:48,702 --> 01:06:50,897
Why what?

1307
01:06:50,971 --> 01:06:52,233
Why are we here?

1308
01:06:55,209 --> 01:06:57,177
No place else to go.

1309
01:06:57,244 --> 01:06:59,439
Did Dad make you go?

1310
01:07:01,482 --> 01:07:03,074
- No, Danny.
- Did he?

1311
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:05,175
It wasn't...
it was no good there.

1312
01:07:05,252 --> 01:07:09,052
And I...
I did something wrong.

1313
01:07:09,123 --> 01:07:11,091
It's no good here.

1314
01:07:11,158 --> 01:07:13,888
I didn't think it would
be like this, but...

1315
01:07:13,994 --> 01:07:16,121
We gotta go back.

1316
01:07:18,198 --> 01:07:19,825
No.

1317
01:07:20,567 --> 01:07:23,001
Why not?
Why not?

1318
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:24,401
It won't always be like this.

1319
01:07:24,471 --> 01:07:27,702
- Mom...
- No, I want you to listen.

1320
01:07:27,775 --> 01:07:29,800
I couldn't get a job...

1321
01:07:29,877 --> 01:07:31,174
but I will, okay?

1322
01:07:31,245 --> 01:07:33,907
Mom, you're lying!
Mom...

1323
01:07:34,048 --> 01:07:35,037
- I promise, I will!
- I want to go home!

1324
01:07:35,115 --> 01:07:37,345
You stop it!
You stop it!

1325
01:07:37,418 --> 01:07:38,680
You stop it!

1326
01:07:38,752 --> 01:07:42,779
Don't pinch me there.

1327
01:07:42,856 --> 01:07:44,346
That's my sore.

1328
01:07:45,893 --> 01:07:48,418
Your what?

1329
01:07:48,495 --> 01:07:49,484
What?

1330
01:07:49,563 --> 01:07:50,552
Let me see.

1331
01:07:52,666 --> 01:07:54,725
How did you do that?

1332
01:07:56,036 --> 01:07:58,630
You hurt yourself or what?

1333
01:07:58,705 --> 01:08:02,471
I don't know.

1334
01:08:04,812 --> 01:08:07,246
I'm so sorry.

1335
01:08:11,385 --> 01:08:13,649
Okay, it's not very legible,
and it hurts, but...

1336
01:08:15,856 --> 01:08:18,017
First time I actually
have to think

1337
01:08:18,092 --> 01:08:19,787
about the value
of every little word,

1338
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,259
and it's just so...

1339
01:08:21,328 --> 01:08:22,727
Ah, it's dangerous.

1340
01:08:22,796 --> 01:08:24,195
There's one.

1341
01:08:24,264 --> 01:08:25,731
Well, it cuts
most of the jobs

1342
01:08:25,799 --> 01:08:26,731
a writer would get

1343
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,392
if you have to think
about the value

1344
01:08:28,469 --> 01:08:29,731
of the words.

1345
01:08:29,803 --> 01:08:31,566
Hollywood re-writes...
<i>National Enquirer...</i>

1346
01:08:31,638 --> 01:08:32,900
Dan Rather's teleprompter.

1347
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,667
Let's see how you're doing.

1348
01:08:34,741 --> 01:08:36,208
Can you read it?

1349
01:08:36,276 --> 01:08:37,402
"Memory...

1350
01:08:37,478 --> 01:08:39,070
upward strokes
and downward slopes..."

1351
01:08:39,146 --> 01:08:40,238
Mm-hmm.

1352
01:08:40,314 --> 01:08:42,009
And what's this?

1353
01:08:42,082 --> 01:08:44,209
"...Comma curls
making me hold..."

1354
01:08:44,284 --> 01:08:46,809
Yeah, I can read it.

1355
01:08:46,887 --> 01:08:48,252
- Oh.
- Making you hold what?

1356
01:08:48,322 --> 01:08:49,346
My breath.

1357
01:08:49,423 --> 01:08:51,618
Words make me hold my breath.

1358
01:08:51,692 --> 01:08:53,751
Do they now?

1359
01:08:53,827 --> 01:08:55,226
Who knows what
they're going to say?

1360
01:08:55,295 --> 01:08:56,262
But...

1361
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:58,798
Who knows where they've been?

1362
01:08:59,967 --> 01:09:02,401
We're getting
a little heavy here, aren't we?

1363
01:09:02,469 --> 01:09:05,961
Well, what made you say that,
Brenda?

1364
01:09:08,342 --> 01:09:09,639
What do you mean?

1365
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:10,802
If we wrote that down.

1366
01:09:10,878 --> 01:09:13,847
Quote, getting a little
heavy, comma,

1367
01:09:13,914 --> 01:09:15,313
aren't we, question mark,
unquote.

1368
01:09:15,382 --> 01:09:16,747
If I did...

1369
01:09:19,686 --> 01:09:21,916
No, it doesn't matter.

1370
01:09:24,658 --> 01:09:27,593
Ah, well, um...
keep at it!

1371
01:09:32,299 --> 01:09:37,066
Quote, ah, well, dash,
keep at it, exclamation mark.

1372
01:09:37,137 --> 01:09:45,545
She smiled, comma,
turned away, dot-dot... dot.

1373
01:09:45,612 --> 01:09:48,410
Ooh, going off the page.

1374
01:09:48,482 --> 01:09:51,042
Stop... finished, period.

1375
01:09:53,987 --> 01:09:54,919
He's dead,

1376
01:09:55,055 --> 01:09:56,113
period.

1377
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:58,920
Out of it, period.

1378
01:10:00,194 --> 01:10:01,161
That's it.

1379
01:10:01,228 --> 01:10:03,093
All done.

1380
01:10:03,163 --> 01:10:04,425
Great.

1381
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,798
Mmm...

1382
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:11,531
I like that.

1383
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:16,805
Now Dan Dark's whole script
is in the machine...

1384
01:10:16,877 --> 01:10:18,640
Minus his name.

1385
01:10:18,712 --> 01:10:22,113
...we can run off
as many copies as we need,

1386
01:10:22,182 --> 01:10:26,812
and they can tinker with it
if they want.

1387
01:10:28,388 --> 01:10:29,320
So now

1388
01:10:29,389 --> 01:10:30,447
we deliver.

1389
01:10:30,524 --> 01:10:32,651
And we could.

1390
01:10:42,069 --> 01:10:44,264
But you must get Dark

1391
01:10:44,338 --> 01:10:45,930
to sign the rights
to my company.

1392
01:10:46,006 --> 01:10:48,270
That's essential.

1393
01:10:48,342 --> 01:10:49,934
Okay. Move forward a little.

1394
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:50,942
That better?

1395
01:10:51,011 --> 01:10:52,137
Yeah.

1396
01:10:52,212 --> 01:10:53,144
Oh... that's fine.

1397
01:10:53,213 --> 01:10:55,147
Okay. One...

1398
01:10:55,215 --> 01:10:58,275
he signs with me.

1399
01:10:58,352 --> 01:10:59,444
Two...

1400
01:11:01,622 --> 01:11:03,556
...I sell it on...

1401
01:11:03,624 --> 01:11:08,891
I-I mean we sell it on
to Mail Pouch Films,

1402
01:11:08,962 --> 01:11:11,897
and three...

1403
01:11:11,965 --> 01:11:14,229
net profit...

1404
01:11:14,301 --> 01:11:15,393
one million.

1405
01:11:17,838 --> 01:11:19,237
Plus points.

1406
01:11:19,306 --> 01:11:20,568
Plus points.

1407
01:11:20,641 --> 01:11:22,541
But he's gotta sign.

1408
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:28,447
Don't worry.

1409
01:11:28,515 --> 01:11:30,380
I can get him...

1410
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:32,884
to do... anything!

1411
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:36,448
Oh, yeah.

1412
01:11:36,523 --> 01:11:40,516
Oh, oh, oh... Good girl... Oh...

1413
01:11:52,072 --> 01:11:53,039
Hello.

1414
01:11:57,978 --> 01:11:58,910
Hey.

1415
01:11:58,979 --> 01:12:00,947
Hey. I was just

1416
01:12:01,014 --> 01:12:02,504
thinking about you.

1417
01:12:02,582 --> 01:12:03,514
Really?

1418
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,515
Mm-hmm.

1419
01:12:04,584 --> 01:12:06,916
What were you
thinking about me?

1420
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,317
I was thinking
you look terrific.

1421
01:12:08,388 --> 01:12:09,320
Hmm.

1422
01:12:09,389 --> 01:12:10,754
So do you.

1423
01:12:10,824 --> 01:12:13,156
You look better.

1424
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,086
Don't, Dan.

1425
01:12:15,162 --> 01:12:16,129
Don't what?

1426
01:12:16,196 --> 01:12:17,220
Look at me like that.

1427
01:12:17,297 --> 01:12:18,264
Like what?

1428
01:12:18,332 --> 01:12:19,299
Like I'm your enemy.

1429
01:12:19,366 --> 01:12:20,924
Oh, you are definitely
up to something.

1430
01:12:21,001 --> 01:12:22,025
You are so definitely involved

1431
01:12:22,102 --> 01:12:23,091
in some kind
of fucking scam.

1432
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:24,102
Good old Danny.

1433
01:12:24,171 --> 01:12:25,365
And it probably has something

1434
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:26,565
to do with money... my money.

1435
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:27,766
You haven't got any money.

1436
01:12:27,841 --> 01:12:31,436
No. Not in cash, maybe.

1437
01:12:31,511 --> 01:12:34,571
Not in good, old-fashioned,
foldable, chewable lettuce.

1438
01:12:34,648 --> 01:12:36,240
No. Nor in coins, come to that.

1439
01:12:36,316 --> 01:12:38,841
Nothing to go
chink-chink in my pocket,

1440
01:12:38,919 --> 01:12:40,318
but I have assets.

1441
01:12:40,387 --> 01:12:41,854
Like what?

1442
01:12:41,922 --> 01:12:44,254
My four detective stories.

1443
01:12:44,324 --> 01:12:45,450
Yeah...

1444
01:12:45,525 --> 01:12:47,584
Three of which
are out of print.

1445
01:12:47,661 --> 01:12:49,561
And the screenplay.

1446
01:12:49,629 --> 01:12:50,618
What screenplay?

1447
01:12:50,697 --> 01:12:51,925
Bingo!

1448
01:12:51,998 --> 01:12:53,260
Fucking bingo.

1449
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:55,927
Danny, please,
you gotta fill me in.

1450
01:12:56,002 --> 01:12:57,128
What are you talking about?

1451
01:12:57,204 --> 01:12:58,330
With my own two hands.

1452
01:12:58,405 --> 01:13:00,839
With these dead,
buckled, chicken feet!

1453
01:13:00,907 --> 01:13:02,807
I wrote it six,
seven years ago.

1454
01:13:02,876 --> 01:13:04,207
Danny.

1455
01:13:04,277 --> 01:13:05,869
What screenplay is this?

1456
01:13:05,946 --> 01:13:07,345
"What screenplay?"

1457
01:13:07,414 --> 01:13:09,507
<i>The Singing Detective,</i>
that's what.

1458
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:14,552
Danny.

1459
01:13:14,621 --> 01:13:16,054
I put it...
I put it in the thing.

1460
01:13:16,123 --> 01:13:17,317
I put it up
in the shoe boxes,

1461
01:13:17,391 --> 01:13:18,585
and I put it in the closet.

1462
01:13:20,627 --> 01:13:22,891
Oh, that.

1463
01:13:22,963 --> 01:13:24,021
"Oh, that."

1464
01:13:24,097 --> 01:13:25,155
Oh, my God.

1465
01:13:25,232 --> 01:13:26,221
Yes, that.

1466
01:13:26,299 --> 01:13:27,357
Well, wait a minute.

1467
01:13:27,434 --> 01:13:29,368
If it's the pages
I think you mean,

1468
01:13:29,436 --> 01:13:32,371
you threw them out. Ages ago.

1469
01:13:32,439 --> 01:13:33,371
- No.
- Yes.

1470
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,374
No. I threw them out.

1471
01:13:35,442 --> 01:13:36,875
- I threw them out.
- Dan, yes, you did.

1472
01:13:36,943 --> 01:13:37,932
You threw them out.

1473
01:13:38,078 --> 01:13:39,443
You said it was garbage.

1474
01:13:39,513 --> 01:13:40,639
What are you doing?

1475
01:13:50,524 --> 01:13:52,458
Oh, well.

1476
01:13:52,526 --> 01:13:53,959
Easy come. Easy go.

1477
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,584
Was it the only copy?

1478
01:13:57,664 --> 01:13:58,961
Of course.

1479
01:14:07,941 --> 01:14:09,408
Did I squeeze it?
Did that hurt?

1480
01:14:09,476 --> 01:14:10,568
My heart, you mean?

1481
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:14,071
You are improving, though,
you know?

1482
01:14:14,147 --> 01:14:15,079
You really...

1483
01:14:15,148 --> 01:14:16,410
Except I'm going crazy.

1484
01:14:16,483 --> 01:14:17,415
Hey, now.

1485
01:14:17,484 --> 01:14:18,416
I'm going crazy.

1486
01:14:18,485 --> 01:14:21,045
I lie here and make
these connections

1487
01:14:21,121 --> 01:14:23,146
between my cheap
little detective story

1488
01:14:23,223 --> 01:14:26,090
and my own cheap little...

1489
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:28,252
Oh, to hell with it.

1490
01:14:30,964 --> 01:14:32,226
Sex.

1491
01:14:32,299 --> 01:14:33,561
Yeah, I know the word.

1492
01:14:33,633 --> 01:14:36,193
Yeah, but that's what
the whole thing is about.

1493
01:14:36,269 --> 01:14:39,238
My book. My life.
It's about sex.

1494
01:14:39,306 --> 01:14:40,603
Sex and lies.

1495
01:14:43,977 --> 01:14:46,571
Oh... I want to sleep
with you again.

1496
01:14:46,646 --> 01:14:47,772
Dan.

1497
01:14:47,848 --> 01:14:49,645
I do. With a big
mirror alongside.

1498
01:14:49,716 --> 01:14:52,241
Oh, stop.

1499
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:54,446
That's so I can look
over at myself

1500
01:14:54,521 --> 01:14:57,922
while I'm fucking
and just leer.

1501
01:14:57,991 --> 01:15:01,518
And right as it's coming up
in me, the ol' joy juice,

1502
01:15:01,595 --> 01:15:03,859
I flip it over to one side

1503
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:06,524
and come off your gleaming
loins, honey, and just

1504
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,034
spit right in my own face.

1505
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:11,567
Oh, my God.

1506
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,398
Well. It's improvement.

1507
01:15:15,475 --> 01:15:17,204
What is?

1508
01:15:17,277 --> 01:15:19,404
Spitting at myself.

1509
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:22,846
A couple of days ago my idea of
true bliss would have been...

1510
01:15:24,150 --> 01:15:26,118
...spitting into your face.

1511
01:15:26,186 --> 01:15:27,278
- Dan.
- Huh?

1512
01:15:27,354 --> 01:15:28,582
What are you going
to do about this?

1513
01:15:28,655 --> 01:15:29,587
- What?
- This rage,

1514
01:15:29,656 --> 01:15:31,089
this thing you have,
this hatred?

1515
01:15:31,157 --> 01:15:32,647
What are you going
to do about it?

1516
01:15:32,726 --> 01:15:34,921
Well, I'll probably just
write serious literature.

1517
01:15:35,061 --> 01:15:37,222
Just piss in the wind
like poets and priests do.

1518
01:15:37,297 --> 01:15:38,229
Who are they?

1519
01:15:38,298 --> 01:15:39,629
Who are those two?
Who are you?!

1520
01:15:39,699 --> 01:15:40,825
Who is who?

1521
01:15:40,901 --> 01:15:43,597
Go, go, go and look,
go and look.

1522
01:15:44,971 --> 01:15:46,268
No. I don't see anything.

1523
01:15:47,474 --> 01:15:49,567
What is the matter?

1524
01:15:49,643 --> 01:15:51,235
Paranoia.

1525
01:15:51,311 --> 01:15:54,109
Thank you.

1526
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:57,240
Baby, I'm so paranoid.

1527
01:15:57,317 --> 01:15:58,648
Then you've got
everything going

1528
01:15:58,718 --> 01:15:59,650
for you, haven't you?

1529
01:15:59,719 --> 01:16:01,209
Mm-hmm.

1530
01:16:05,926 --> 01:16:09,293
I'm telling you, people
are beginning to notice us.

1531
01:16:09,362 --> 01:16:11,387
You see, they're looking at us.

1532
01:16:11,464 --> 01:16:14,524
Who cares? They're all
sick in here, anyway.

1533
01:16:14,601 --> 01:16:16,535
Are you sure that's
him, with the...?

1534
01:16:16,603 --> 01:16:17,900
The nurse said so.

1535
01:16:19,472 --> 01:16:23,533
Maybe we should've brought
flowers... or grapes.

1536
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:25,202
What for?

1537
01:16:25,278 --> 01:16:26,870
Less conspicuous.

1538
01:16:26,947 --> 01:16:28,073
Oh, yeah.

1539
01:16:28,148 --> 01:16:29,274
What are we going to do?

1540
01:16:29,349 --> 01:16:31,214
We going to waste
him, whack him, what?

1541
01:16:31,284 --> 01:16:32,876
Well, not when
that dame's there.

1542
01:16:32,953 --> 01:16:34,352
We gotta make him sing first.

1543
01:16:34,421 --> 01:16:35,547
Another fuckin' song?

1544
01:16:35,622 --> 01:16:36,554
- Shut up.
- Hey.

1545
01:16:36,623 --> 01:16:37,715
Talk. I mean.

1546
01:16:37,791 --> 01:16:39,588
Tell us what
we're doing here.

1547
01:16:39,659 --> 01:16:42,219
I-I'm sick of standing around
like a dummy.

1548
01:16:42,295 --> 01:16:44,923
Are we Feds
or aren't we?

1549
01:16:44,998 --> 01:16:46,022
No. We're just
a couple of hoods.

1550
01:16:46,099 --> 01:16:47,031
- Shut up.
- Hey.

1551
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,067
Do you need any help?

1552
01:16:52,339 --> 01:16:54,603
Uh, do we?

1553
01:16:55,675 --> 01:16:57,905
Uh, thank you, miss. No.

1554
01:16:57,978 --> 01:17:01,505
Um, we have seen all
that we wish to see,

1555
01:17:01,581 --> 01:17:05,108
and our report, uh,
will be a-arriving...

1556
01:17:05,185 --> 01:17:06,117
Let's go.

1557
01:17:06,186 --> 01:17:07,653
Hey!

1558
01:17:07,721 --> 01:17:09,416
What are you doing here?

1559
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:15,652
Now, when I get the blues,
I get me a rocking chair

1560
01:17:17,397 --> 01:17:23,825
When I get the blues,
I get me a rocking chair

1561
01:17:23,903 --> 01:17:25,200
Well, the blues overtake me

1562
01:17:25,271 --> 01:17:27,364
Gonna rock
right away from here

1563
01:17:29,309 --> 01:17:31,869
Now flip, flop and fly

1564
01:17:31,945 --> 01:17:35,210
I don't care if I die

1565
01:17:35,281 --> 01:17:37,511
Now flip, flop and fly

1566
01:17:37,584 --> 01:17:40,712
Don't care if I die...

1567
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:44,922
Where are you?

1568
01:17:44,991 --> 01:17:45,923
I'm lost.

1569
01:17:45,992 --> 01:17:46,924
Lost?

1570
01:17:46,993 --> 01:17:48,221
Sorry. I'm lost.

1571
01:17:48,294 --> 01:17:50,228
Huh?

1572
01:17:50,296 --> 01:17:52,764
I have a confession to make.

1573
01:17:52,832 --> 01:17:54,322
Uh-huh.

1574
01:17:55,969 --> 01:17:57,368
I know more about
that movie offer

1575
01:17:57,437 --> 01:17:58,563
than I implied.

1576
01:17:58,638 --> 01:18:00,833
Oh, shit. Come clean.

1577
01:18:00,907 --> 01:18:03,842
Okay, I... I went, um...

1578
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:05,434
to your apartment,
just to check it out

1579
01:18:05,512 --> 01:18:06,877
'cause you've been
in here so long.

1580
01:18:06,946 --> 01:18:07,878
Mm-hmm.

1581
01:18:07,947 --> 01:18:09,380
Um...

1582
01:18:09,449 --> 01:18:10,711
First of all, Dan...

1583
01:18:10,784 --> 01:18:12,046
Mmm? Mmm.

1584
01:18:12,118 --> 01:18:14,177
...the way that you live
is unbelievable.

1585
01:18:14,254 --> 01:18:15,653
The plants?
They're all dead.

1586
01:18:15,722 --> 01:18:17,053
Good. I hope they suffered.

1587
01:18:17,123 --> 01:18:19,318
There is mold on every
single living thing.

1588
01:18:19,392 --> 01:18:21,257
Uh-huh. Give me
some yogurt, please.

1589
01:18:21,327 --> 01:18:22,316
First of all, who goes away

1590
01:18:22,395 --> 01:18:23,726
and leaves Camembert
on the table?

1591
01:18:23,797 --> 01:18:25,731
You opened my mail.

1592
01:18:25,799 --> 01:18:27,130
Yes. I did,
but just the bills...

1593
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,132
You opened my mail.

1594
01:18:28,201 --> 01:18:30,260
...and this one letter.

1595
01:18:30,336 --> 01:18:31,633
Don't worry about the bills.

1596
01:18:31,705 --> 01:18:33,070
That's where I grow the mold.

1597
01:18:33,139 --> 01:18:34,071
- Anyway.
- From who?

1598
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:35,539
...this production company.

1599
01:18:35,608 --> 01:18:37,200
It's about <i>Singing Detective.</i>

1600
01:18:37,277 --> 01:18:38,505
Well, yes, it's from

1601
01:18:38,578 --> 01:18:39,602
this producer, Finney.

1602
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:40,737
Okay.

1603
01:18:40,814 --> 01:18:41,746
Binney?

1604
01:18:41,815 --> 01:18:43,214
Finney.

1605
01:18:43,283 --> 01:18:44,409
- Finney with an "F"?
- Yes.

1606
01:18:44,484 --> 01:18:45,883
Finney with an "F," not a "B"?

1607
01:18:45,952 --> 01:18:47,010
- Right. Finney.
- Finney. Not a "B."

1608
01:18:47,087 --> 01:18:48,884
- 'Cause you know him.
- What are you...? What?

1609
01:18:48,955 --> 01:18:49,887
You know him.

1610
01:18:49,956 --> 01:18:50,888
I've never heard of him.

1611
01:18:50,957 --> 01:18:52,618
In what context have
you never heard of him?

1612
01:18:52,692 --> 01:18:53,750
- Danny.
- What?

1613
01:18:53,827 --> 01:18:55,692
- Why are you so...?
- Where's the letter?

1614
01:18:55,762 --> 01:18:57,195
- Where's the letter?
- I'll get it.

1615
01:18:57,263 --> 01:18:58,230
Where's the letter?

1616
01:18:59,632 --> 01:19:00,758
It checks out?

1617
01:19:00,834 --> 01:19:03,826
Well, for what it's worth.

1618
01:19:03,903 --> 01:19:05,495
But would I get
some dough up front?

1619
01:19:05,572 --> 01:19:06,698
So it says.

1620
01:19:06,773 --> 01:19:07,831
How much?

1621
01:19:07,907 --> 01:19:08,874
40 grand.

1622
01:19:09,008 --> 01:19:10,839
Ugh. Shit.

1623
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:12,343
- But that's for the rights?
- Right.

1624
01:19:12,412 --> 01:19:13,811
Well, who's going to do
the screenplay?

1625
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,177
Maybe I can get a shot at it.

1626
01:19:15,248 --> 01:19:16,840
Well, the producer,
Finney, apparently.

1627
01:19:16,916 --> 01:19:19,851
The producer.
Why? Why? All these...

1628
01:19:19,919 --> 01:19:21,147
guys, they think
they can write,

1629
01:19:21,221 --> 01:19:22,245
every busy little schmuck

1630
01:19:22,322 --> 01:19:23,789
who can hold a pen
the right way up.

1631
01:19:23,857 --> 01:19:25,586
I know, so we just take
the money and run.

1632
01:19:25,658 --> 01:19:27,853
Oh, I... I...

1633
01:19:27,927 --> 01:19:29,087
Okay.

1634
01:19:31,264 --> 01:19:32,526
It's a good story, though.

1635
01:19:32,599 --> 01:19:33,861
Mm-hmm.

1636
01:19:33,933 --> 01:19:35,901
If it'd stay on the page.

1637
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:38,430
Mm-hmm.

1638
01:19:40,273 --> 01:19:41,570
It's all connections.

1639
01:19:43,042 --> 01:19:44,532
Connections.

1640
01:19:44,611 --> 01:19:46,340
Connections.

1641
01:19:55,488 --> 01:19:56,546
Oh, God.

1642
01:19:56,623 --> 01:19:59,751
Oh... oh,
we shouldn't have run.

1643
01:19:59,826 --> 01:20:00,918
No choice.

1644
01:20:05,165 --> 01:20:07,099
Where the fuck is this?

1645
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,759
Why here?

1646
01:20:08,835 --> 01:20:11,269
What are we doing here?

1647
01:20:11,337 --> 01:20:12,998
Geez. Look at that sun.

1648
01:20:14,641 --> 01:20:15,903
That is the sun, right?

1649
01:20:15,975 --> 01:20:18,409
It's a big fucking moon
if it isn't.

1650
01:20:18,478 --> 01:20:19,570
What is going on?

1651
01:20:19,646 --> 01:20:20,670
What's going on?

1652
01:20:29,989 --> 01:20:33,254
What are we gonna do?

1653
01:20:33,326 --> 01:20:34,486
Hey.

1654
01:20:35,995 --> 01:20:39,487
There's a building over
there... way over there.

1655
01:20:41,668 --> 01:20:44,136
"Chew Mail Pouch Tobacco."

1656
01:20:44,204 --> 01:20:45,603
Oh, no, I hate that stuff.

1657
01:20:45,672 --> 01:20:47,264
It gets in my throat and my...

1658
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:51,470
Maybe what we're looking
for is in that building.

1659
01:20:51,544 --> 01:20:53,944
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1660
01:20:54,013 --> 01:20:55,708
What are we looking for?

1661
01:20:59,552 --> 01:21:00,644
I don't know.

1662
01:21:07,961 --> 01:21:10,521
Nor me...

1663
01:21:10,597 --> 01:21:11,791
Nor me.

1664
01:21:13,967 --> 01:21:18,563
People see us everywhere

1665
01:21:18,638 --> 01:21:23,234
They think you really care

1666
01:21:23,309 --> 01:21:26,904
But myself I can't deceive

1667
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:32,441
I know it's
only make believe

1668
01:21:32,518 --> 01:21:37,455
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba,
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bah, oh...

1669
01:21:37,523 --> 01:21:43,553
My one and only prayer
is that some day you'll care

1670
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:46,190
My hopes,
my dreams come true

1671
01:21:46,266 --> 01:21:49,394
My one and only you

1672
01:21:49,469 --> 01:21:55,135
No one will ever know
how much I love you so

1673
01:21:55,208 --> 01:22:00,145
My only prayer will be
someday you'll care for me

1674
01:22:00,213 --> 01:22:10,316
But it's only make-believe...

1675
01:22:10,423 --> 01:22:12,084
Hey, son.

1676
01:22:14,227 --> 01:22:16,752
Tough guys don't cry.

1677
01:22:22,802 --> 01:22:24,599
I know that, sir.

1678
01:22:28,474 --> 01:22:32,740
I can't now separate in my mind

1679
01:22:32,812 --> 01:22:35,246
the bus that took my mom and me
to L.A.

1680
01:22:35,315 --> 01:22:37,283
From the one
which brought us back.

1681
01:22:40,486 --> 01:22:43,114
Brought me back.

1682
01:22:45,858 --> 01:22:47,291
I dream about it.

1683
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,920
I still dream about it.

1684
01:22:49,996 --> 01:22:51,429
But I'm getting there.

1685
01:22:51,497 --> 01:22:52,964
My head's getting there.

1686
01:22:54,133 --> 01:22:55,930
Well...

1687
01:22:56,002 --> 01:22:57,469
What happened to your mother?

1688
01:22:58,671 --> 01:23:00,639
She killed herself.

1689
01:23:02,942 --> 01:23:04,409
How?

1690
01:23:05,945 --> 01:23:07,879
In the river.

1691
01:23:07,947 --> 01:23:09,574
In the river.

1692
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:13,714
Uh... is-is that really
what happened?

1693
01:23:13,786 --> 01:23:15,048
What?

1694
01:23:15,121 --> 01:23:16,315
Well, now, now, I...

1695
01:23:16,389 --> 01:23:18,584
"Now, now"? Wait, wait.
No. Excuse me. What?

1696
01:23:19,792 --> 01:23:22,283
You have a young woman
drowned in a bathtub

1697
01:23:22,362 --> 01:23:24,557
and thrown in the river
in your story.

1698
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:26,723
So, what about it?
So, what about it?

1699
01:23:26,799 --> 01:23:28,767
Sometimes a cigar
is just a cigar.

1700
01:23:29,802 --> 01:23:30,928
Uh-huh.

1701
01:23:31,004 --> 01:23:32,801
Well, I'm a bit surprised
that you would duplicate

1702
01:23:32,872 --> 01:23:34,897
such a traumatic event
in your own life in the pages...

1703
01:23:34,974 --> 01:23:36,737
In what? Oh, oh, in a
commercial piece of trash?

1704
01:23:36,809 --> 01:23:37,901
I didn't say that.

1705
01:23:37,977 --> 01:23:38,944
No, you didn't say that.

1706
01:23:39,012 --> 01:23:40,104
Mm-hmm.

1707
01:23:40,179 --> 01:23:41,476
No, Dan, I read you
part of your book

1708
01:23:41,547 --> 01:23:42,536
to illustrate a point to you.

1709
01:23:42,615 --> 01:23:44,242
Book. I'll tell you,
that book... that book...

1710
01:23:44,317 --> 01:23:45,545
There are things
in that book, Doc,

1711
01:23:45,618 --> 01:23:47,313
that are reaching out
to grab me by the throat.

1712
01:23:47,387 --> 01:23:49,787
Why don't you let them?

1713
01:23:51,124 --> 01:23:54,616
Why? What?

1714
01:23:54,694 --> 01:23:56,321
Let 'em.

1715
01:23:58,998 --> 01:24:01,466
Me, I'm in that book,
and I didn't even know it.

1716
01:24:02,935 --> 01:24:04,425
Yes.

1717
01:24:10,376 --> 01:24:12,867
I didn't kill my mother.

1718
01:24:12,945 --> 01:24:16,403
I can't imagine that anyone
would ever suggest that you did.

1719
01:24:18,951 --> 01:24:23,786
You know, I... when
I was a... a... boy...

1720
01:24:23,856 --> 01:24:25,915
Long ago and far away.

1721
01:24:26,059 --> 01:24:29,256
No. Here and now.

1722
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:31,927
I saw my mother
with the greaseball

1723
01:24:31,998 --> 01:24:36,935
who worked with my father...
like, a partner...

1724
01:24:38,971 --> 01:24:40,939
...in this service station
in the desert

1725
01:24:41,074 --> 01:24:42,735
that was never really viable.

1726
01:24:42,809 --> 01:24:44,743
Dark and Binney.

1727
01:24:44,811 --> 01:24:47,905
Shit, they were screwing,
you know?

1728
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:50,540
The noises,
him on top of her, I guess.

1729
01:24:50,616 --> 01:24:53,312
Kiss, bang, bang...
all that stuff.

1730
01:24:53,386 --> 01:24:54,478
I don't know.

1731
01:24:54,554 --> 01:24:56,249
Maybe she would have
gotten away with it.

1732
01:24:56,322 --> 01:24:57,619
Maybe it was just...

1733
01:25:01,594 --> 01:25:04,995
My dad was a hard
sort of guy to talk to.

1734
01:25:05,064 --> 01:25:06,895
You know, he was good,

1735
01:25:06,999 --> 01:25:08,694
you know, but, as a kid,

1736
01:25:08,768 --> 01:25:12,135
I couldn't seem to get close.

1737
01:25:12,205 --> 01:25:13,502
He was good with engines,
you know?

1738
01:25:13,573 --> 01:25:16,041
Anything under the hood,
and he was just...

1739
01:25:16,109 --> 01:25:20,546
He was so quiet. He was just...
he was just too quiet.

1740
01:25:20,613 --> 01:25:23,878
And I wanted to get closer,
you know?

1741
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:28,387
I mean, maybe I wasn't the kind
of kid he would have wanted,

1742
01:25:28,454 --> 01:25:29,921
you know?

1743
01:25:30,957 --> 01:25:33,755
Reading,
and off on my own and...

1744
01:25:35,962 --> 01:25:37,395
...locked in.

1745
01:25:37,463 --> 01:25:43,333
That pain-in-the-ass kid stuff,
but...

1746
01:25:48,307 --> 01:25:51,367
I wanted to get closer,
and I... I...

1747
01:25:51,444 --> 01:25:53,810
So you told him about her.

1748
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,074
Well, I traded her in.

1749
01:25:55,148 --> 01:25:58,083
I traded her in
for a pat on the head.

1750
01:25:58,151 --> 01:25:59,641
No. No.

1751
01:25:59,719 --> 01:26:01,653
I got beat instead,
and so did she.

1752
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:04,849
He just hit her from one side
of the room to the other.

1753
01:26:04,924 --> 01:26:08,189
And we went...

1754
01:26:08,261 --> 01:26:10,229
to L.A.

1755
01:26:10,296 --> 01:26:11,456
You know, but by then

1756
01:26:11,531 --> 01:26:14,193
I think my pa's rage
had-had-had cooled down.

1757
01:26:14,267 --> 01:26:15,859
I don't think
he wanted us to go,

1758
01:26:15,935 --> 01:26:17,402
'cause I remember him waving.

1759
01:26:20,273 --> 01:26:23,834
I remember him waving to us
as the bus went away.

1760
01:26:26,312 --> 01:26:27,779
Away.

1761
01:26:27,847 --> 01:26:30,873
And I...

1762
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:33,248
And my mom couldn't get a job.

1763
01:26:33,319 --> 01:26:34,411
It was just, you know...

1764
01:26:37,456 --> 01:26:39,754
She started
bringing men home and...

1765
01:26:41,294 --> 01:26:43,489
Oh, the poor bitch.

1766
01:26:45,464 --> 01:26:46,897
I remember these cracks.

1767
01:26:46,966 --> 01:26:48,763
There were these cracks
on the ceiling.

1768
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:53,029
I remember these cracks.

1769
01:27:15,494 --> 01:27:17,155
All right.

1770
01:27:19,265 --> 01:27:20,698
Stand up.

1771
01:27:20,766 --> 01:27:22,028
What?

1772
01:27:22,101 --> 01:27:24,194
You can. You can do it.

1773
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:26,204
Oh, you think so?

1774
01:27:26,272 --> 01:27:28,797
It's now or never.

1775
01:27:31,277 --> 01:27:34,007
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1776
01:27:35,948 --> 01:27:37,745
How many steps to heaven, Doc?

1777
01:27:37,817 --> 01:27:40,377
Ah, metaphysics.

1778
01:27:40,453 --> 01:27:41,852
Music.

1779
01:27:46,792 --> 01:27:49,260
Try again. Take your time.

1780
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:56,530
I'm sorry. How many steps?

1781
01:27:59,839 --> 01:28:01,602
- Now, there
- Three steps to heaven

1782
01:28:01,674 --> 01:28:07,112
- Are three steps to heaven
- Three steps to heaven

1783
01:28:07,179 --> 01:28:08,874
- Just listen
- Three steps to heaven

1784
01:28:08,981 --> 01:28:13,884

1785
01:28:13,986 --> 01:28:17,854
And as life travels on

1786
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:21,359
And things do go wrong

1787
01:28:21,427 --> 01:28:23,361
- Just follow
- Three steps to heaven

1788
01:28:23,429 --> 01:28:26,330
- Steps one, two and three
- Three steps to heaven

1789
01:28:28,267 --> 01:28:30,360
Step one

1790
01:28:30,436 --> 01:28:33,564
You find a girl you love

1791
01:28:35,174 --> 01:28:36,471
Step two

1792
01:28:37,643 --> 01:28:40,373
She falls in love with you

1793
01:28:42,948 --> 01:28:45,644
Step three, you kiss

1794
01:28:45,718 --> 01:28:49,779
And hold her tightly

1795
01:28:49,855 --> 01:28:51,550
- Yeah, that sure
- Three steps to heaven

1796
01:28:51,624 --> 01:28:55,583
- Seems like heaven to me
- Three steps to heaven

1797
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,094
- The formula for heaven's
- Three steps to heaven

1798
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:05,535
- Very simple
- Three steps to heaven

1799
01:29:05,604 --> 01:29:08,004
Ooh, wa-wa, ooh

1800
01:29:08,074 --> 01:29:09,541
Just follow the rules

1801
01:29:09,608 --> 01:29:12,441
Three steps to heaven,
Three steps to heaven

1802
01:29:12,511 --> 01:29:15,173
- And you will see
- Ooh

1803
01:29:15,247 --> 01:29:20,412
And as life travels on

1804
01:29:20,486 --> 01:29:21,783
And things do go wrong

1805
01:29:21,854 --> 01:29:25,017
- Just follow
- Three steps to heaven

1806
01:29:25,091 --> 01:29:29,994
- Steps one, two and three
- Three steps to heaven

1807
01:29:30,062 --> 01:29:31,495
Step one

1808
01:29:31,564 --> 01:29:37,696
- You find a girl you love
- Ah, ah-ah

1809
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:39,362
- Step two...
- No, no.

1810
01:29:39,438 --> 01:29:42,373
She falls in love with you...

1811
01:29:42,441 --> 01:29:45,171
Ah, yes.

1812
01:29:46,946 --> 01:29:48,379
Huh?

1813
01:29:48,447 --> 01:29:49,880
Hey, that's great, man.

1814
01:29:49,949 --> 01:29:51,314
Hey, can I get an amen, brother?

1815
01:29:51,384 --> 01:29:52,351
Yeah, amen, whatever.

1816
01:29:53,953 --> 01:29:55,386
One, two, three.

1817
01:29:55,454 --> 01:29:56,887
No, no, no. Leave me, leave me.

1818
01:29:56,956 --> 01:29:58,389
I got it, I got it.

1819
01:29:58,457 --> 01:30:00,391
Yee-hah!

1820
01:30:00,459 --> 01:30:01,926
Geronimo.

1821
01:30:09,969 --> 01:30:12,369
That book. There were things
in that book, Doc,

1822
01:30:12,438 --> 01:30:14,872
that are reaching out
to grab me by the throat.

1823
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:16,703
Why don't you let them?

1824
01:30:40,332 --> 01:30:42,960
Sorry you got put on hold,
Mr. Binney.

1825
01:30:45,838 --> 01:30:47,305
Don't sweat the bill.

1826
01:30:56,682 --> 01:30:58,149
So now we wait.

1827
01:30:59,852 --> 01:31:01,251
We wait, and we see.

1828
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:41,623
You had it coming, baby.

1829
01:31:43,329 --> 01:31:45,627
They should have
cut your dick off first.

1830
01:31:50,002 --> 01:31:52,971
It's led you into
one hell of a fix, eh?

1831
01:31:57,009 --> 01:31:59,136
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1832
01:32:06,452 --> 01:32:08,886
They got to him first.

1833
01:32:08,954 --> 01:32:11,889
Yeah.
One step ahead all the time.

1834
01:32:11,957 --> 01:32:14,391
But I didn't think the Feds
would waste one of their own,

1835
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:15,893
but there you go.

1836
01:32:15,961 --> 01:32:19,055
No morality these days, eh?

1837
01:32:19,131 --> 01:32:21,622
I know, but I wanted
to waste him on my own.

1838
01:32:23,802 --> 01:32:25,429
Well, why not?

1839
01:32:25,504 --> 01:32:27,938
I'd like to wash
all the men off my skin.

1840
01:32:29,975 --> 01:32:32,409
No, we'll give these klutzes
one more chance

1841
01:32:32,478 --> 01:32:35,072
to eliminate the warbler.

1842
01:32:35,147 --> 01:32:36,614
He's a sitting duck.

1843
01:32:38,317 --> 01:32:41,616
I'd like to see the bullet
splatter his larynx.

1844
01:32:43,756 --> 01:32:46,919
Dan Dark is the real killer.

1845
01:32:46,992 --> 01:32:50,359
He poisons other people's lives.

1846
01:32:51,997 --> 01:32:54,932
He thinks he's smart...

1847
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,458
but, really,
he's very, very sad.

1848
01:32:58,537 --> 01:33:01,700
I'm sorry.

1849
01:33:01,774 --> 01:33:03,241
I'm sorry.

1850
01:33:10,783 --> 01:33:12,546
Can you see?

1851
01:33:14,453 --> 01:33:17,013
Can you see, Mr. Dark?

1852
01:33:21,627 --> 01:33:23,595
You like?

1853
01:33:27,967 --> 01:33:31,403
This is what you want
from a woman, Dan.

1854
01:33:31,470 --> 01:33:35,600
Believe her to be a whore.

1855
01:33:35,674 --> 01:33:38,108
Make her one.

1856
01:33:39,311 --> 01:33:41,245
You like?

1857
01:33:41,313 --> 01:33:42,837
You want?

1858
01:33:44,149 --> 01:33:45,844
You're so sad.

1859
01:33:47,152 --> 01:33:51,714
Sad... and sick.

1860
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:53,451
Using your childhood

1861
01:33:53,525 --> 01:33:58,462
to foul up the lives of those
who really care for you.

1862
01:33:58,530 --> 01:34:02,159
Using your illness as a weapon
against anything clean,

1863
01:34:02,234 --> 01:34:04,930
and honest and loving.

1864
01:34:06,305 --> 01:34:08,432
You disgust me.

1865
01:34:10,509 --> 01:34:12,477
You sick little creep.

1866
01:34:14,513 --> 01:34:17,914
You poisonous, malformed,

1867
01:34:17,983 --> 01:34:20,178
cynical heap of shit.

1868
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,912
No!

1869
01:34:23,022 --> 01:34:24,580
No...

1870
01:34:26,225 --> 01:34:28,420
Are you okay?

1871
01:34:28,494 --> 01:34:29,620
Yeah.

1872
01:34:32,231 --> 01:34:33,926
Okay, sure.

1873
01:34:34,033 --> 01:34:35,694
Why not?

1874
01:34:35,768 --> 01:34:39,602
Why aren't you in the bed?

1875
01:34:39,672 --> 01:34:42,505
I'm not in the bed
because I

1876
01:34:42,574 --> 01:34:44,565
stood up all by myself.

1877
01:34:44,643 --> 01:34:45,837
Fantastic.

1878
01:34:45,911 --> 01:34:47,538
Yeah, see what I can do.

1879
01:34:47,613 --> 01:34:49,945
I'll be walking out of here
next week.

1880
01:34:50,049 --> 01:34:51,516
Well, don't overdo it.

1881
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:54,381
You look...
Are you hot?

1882
01:34:54,453 --> 01:34:55,511
Mm-mm.

1883
01:34:55,587 --> 01:34:56,713
Okay, 'cause that's how

1884
01:34:56,789 --> 01:34:58,416
people get disappointed,
you know?

1885
01:34:58,490 --> 01:34:59,650
You got to take it easy.

1886
01:34:59,725 --> 01:35:00,783
No, I'm fine.

1887
01:35:00,859 --> 01:35:01,723
Day by day, in every way,

1888
01:35:01,794 --> 01:35:02,886
I'm getting better
and better.

1889
01:35:02,961 --> 01:35:04,360
All right, well,
I'll let you stand up

1890
01:35:04,430 --> 01:35:05,362
while I lubricate you.

1891
01:35:05,431 --> 01:35:06,898
I think I can,
but I just... my knees...

1892
01:35:06,965 --> 01:35:07,897
No, no.

1893
01:35:07,966 --> 01:35:08,990
I was just kidding.

1894
01:35:09,068 --> 01:35:10,626
No, I don't expect you to...

1895
01:35:10,703 --> 01:35:13,171
I'm just so glad
that you're being...

1896
01:35:13,238 --> 01:35:14,899
It's a real
improvement.

1897
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,372
You know, you're one of

1898
01:35:17,443 --> 01:35:19,411
the nicest people
I've met in a long time.

1899
01:35:20,779 --> 01:35:23,509
Well, you haven't been anywhere
in a long time.

1900
01:35:23,582 --> 01:35:25,812
One of the prettiest, too.

1901
01:35:25,884 --> 01:35:27,715
Oh, your eyes.

1902
01:35:29,588 --> 01:35:31,021
What about them?

1903
01:35:31,090 --> 01:35:32,921
Your mouth.

1904
01:35:33,058 --> 01:35:34,685
The way your head
joins your neck,

1905
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:36,022
as though
it's hesitating...

1906
01:35:36,095 --> 01:35:39,087
No, no, no, it's reluctant to...

1907
01:35:39,164 --> 01:35:42,133
Boy, when I get out of here
I'm just really going to write.

1908
01:35:42,201 --> 01:35:45,398
The way it, though...

1909
01:35:45,471 --> 01:35:47,234
No.

1910
01:35:47,306 --> 01:35:48,933
Oh, you're the girl
in all the songs.

1911
01:35:49,007 --> 01:35:50,941
Hey, pull the Caddy around,

1912
01:35:51,009 --> 01:35:52,033
and let's blow out of here.

1913
01:35:52,111 --> 01:35:54,272
Stop it, Mr. Dark.

1914
01:35:55,981 --> 01:35:57,778
Oh... oh, I see.

1915
01:35:57,850 --> 01:35:59,317
Enough of these intimacies, huh?

1916
01:35:59,384 --> 01:36:01,249
Hell, we hardly know each other.

1917
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:02,753
Christ, the only contact

1918
01:36:02,821 --> 01:36:04,880
we had so far is
you lift up my penis

1919
01:36:05,023 --> 01:36:06,354
and just grease around it.

1920
01:36:06,425 --> 01:36:08,222
Oh, what, what's the matter?

1921
01:36:09,928 --> 01:36:11,691
Whew. Boy, is it hot in here?

1922
01:36:11,764 --> 01:36:13,356
Lie down, um...

1923
01:36:13,432 --> 01:36:14,524
You're burning up.

1924
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,158
Sweet, sweet, sweetness,
I want to see Nicola...

1925
01:36:16,235 --> 01:36:17,497
- No, no. No, Mr. Dark.
- I want to see...

1926
01:36:17,569 --> 01:36:19,332
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You got to lay down.

1927
01:36:19,404 --> 01:36:20,336
I'll find her.

1928
01:36:20,405 --> 01:36:21,633
She's probably
straight out in the hall.

1929
01:36:21,707 --> 01:36:23,641
No, no, no, no.
Come on, Mr. Dark, just stay.

1930
01:36:23,709 --> 01:36:25,768
Come on, come on.

1931
01:36:25,844 --> 01:36:28,142
Nicola?!

1932
01:36:28,213 --> 01:36:31,148
Come on, let's just
go back into the bed.

1933
01:36:31,216 --> 01:36:32,808
Nicola!

1934
01:36:37,756 --> 01:36:39,053
I told you, come on.

1935
01:36:39,124 --> 01:36:40,853
Can I get some help here?!

1936
01:36:40,926 --> 01:36:42,086
I told you.

1937
01:36:42,161 --> 01:36:44,391
It's okay, nurse.
It's okay.

1938
01:36:44,463 --> 01:36:45,930
Gentle.

1939
01:36:45,998 --> 01:36:48,523
Yeah, too heavy for you, angel.

1940
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:50,795
Come on, back in the bed.

1941
01:36:50,869 --> 01:36:53,167
I'm sorry. I am.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1942
01:36:53,238 --> 01:36:55,138
Slide your feet, gumshoe.

1943
01:36:55,207 --> 01:36:56,936
Beddy bye-byes.

1944
01:36:57,075 --> 01:36:59,509
One small step
for man,

1945
01:36:59,578 --> 01:37:02,547
one giant leap...
for a cripple!

1946
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:07,245
Who are you,
and what are you doing here?

1947
01:37:07,319 --> 01:37:08,718
Hey, that's
a good question.

1948
01:37:08,787 --> 01:37:11,187
Right on the nose,
as I think they say nowadays.

1949
01:37:11,256 --> 01:37:12,416
Yeah, whenever that is.

1950
01:37:12,491 --> 01:37:13,549
Am I hot?

1951
01:37:13,625 --> 01:37:14,683
Is this because I'm hot?

1952
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:15,749
I don't know you.

1953
01:37:15,828 --> 01:37:18,422
I don't know who you are,
or what you want.

1954
01:37:18,497 --> 01:37:19,759
Disowning us, are you?

1955
01:37:19,832 --> 01:37:20,594
Nurse?

1956
01:37:20,666 --> 01:37:21,894
Nurse... where'd she go?

1957
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,695
She was just here a second ago.

1958
01:37:23,769 --> 01:37:24,861
- Where are you going?
- Where you going?

1959
01:37:24,937 --> 01:37:26,632
Home.

1960
01:37:26,705 --> 01:37:28,332
That's off
the fucking page, creepo.

1961
01:37:28,407 --> 01:37:29,431
You are going nowhere.

1962
01:37:29,508 --> 01:37:30,702
What...

1963
01:37:30,776 --> 01:37:32,607
We get all the shit

1964
01:37:32,678 --> 01:37:33,906
and no explanations.

1965
01:37:34,012 --> 01:37:35,912
Just one fuck-up
after another.

1966
01:37:36,014 --> 01:37:38,380
And you're the scumbag
that wrote it!

1967
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:39,314
Wait, wait, wait, no, no!

1968
01:37:39,384 --> 01:37:40,578
Many a tear has to fall

1969
01:37:40,652 --> 01:37:41,812
Where-where are we going?

1970
01:37:41,887 --> 01:37:43,878
Shaddup!

1971
01:37:43,956 --> 01:37:45,514
But it's all...

1972
01:37:45,591 --> 01:37:46,558
Where is everybody?

1973
01:37:46,625 --> 01:37:48,559
Help!

1974
01:37:53,799 --> 01:37:57,565
- All in the wonderful game
- Where are we going?!

1975
01:37:57,636 --> 01:38:01,367
That we know as love...

1976
01:38:08,981 --> 01:38:10,278
Well, you can rock it,
you can roll it

1977
01:38:10,349 --> 01:38:11,407
Do the stop
and even stroll it

1978
01:38:11,483 --> 01:38:14,350
- At the hop
- Hop, hop, hop, hop

1979
01:38:14,419 --> 01:38:15,511
When the record starts...

1980
01:38:15,587 --> 01:38:16,713
Rewrite!

1981
01:38:27,532 --> 01:38:29,500
Ooh, long way down, fella.

1982
01:38:29,568 --> 01:38:31,763
Right, it's a good last page,

1983
01:38:31,837 --> 01:38:32,769
bucklehand.

1984
01:38:32,838 --> 01:38:33,896
Splash!

1985
01:38:33,972 --> 01:38:35,439
Yeah, it's pooper scooper time
now.

1986
01:38:35,507 --> 01:38:36,906
Yeah, so spill.

1987
01:38:37,009 --> 01:38:37,998
Who are we?

1988
01:38:38,076 --> 01:38:38,667
What are we?

1989
01:38:38,744 --> 01:38:41,178
When, when you smile

1990
01:38:41,246 --> 01:38:42,736
When you smile at me

1991
01:38:44,116 --> 01:38:46,107
Well, well, I know

1992
01:38:46,184 --> 01:38:48,744
Our love will always be...

1993
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:51,448
When, when you kiss

1994
01:38:51,523 --> 01:38:53,582
When you kiss me right

1995
01:38:53,659 --> 01:38:56,059
I, I don't want

1996
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:58,926
To ever say good night

1997
01:38:59,031 --> 01:39:02,125
When will you be mine?

1998
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:05,658
Oh, baby, I need you

1999
01:39:05,737 --> 01:39:08,865
I want you near me

2000
01:39:08,974 --> 01:39:10,566
I love you

2001
01:39:10,642 --> 01:39:14,635
Yes, I do,
and I hope you hear me!

2002
01:39:19,952 --> 01:39:23,149
You know, personally,

2003
01:39:23,221 --> 01:39:26,247
I don't want to walk down
no mean corridors.

2004
01:39:26,325 --> 01:39:27,451
No, sir.

2005
01:39:27,526 --> 01:39:30,324
But there's just no pay-off
in picking bluebells.

2006
01:39:30,395 --> 01:39:32,420
Am I right, or am I right?

2007
01:39:36,168 --> 01:39:38,193
God, listen to that, would you?

2008
01:39:38,270 --> 01:39:39,703
Can you hear the guy?

2009
01:39:39,771 --> 01:39:43,832
Anybody'd think his arm
was being twisted.

2010
01:39:43,909 --> 01:39:48,107
Hell, we've all been in pain,
one time or another.

2011
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:52,480
What I say is, when you're
dealing with the devil,

2012
01:39:52,551 --> 01:39:55,179
praise the Lord...

2013
01:39:55,253 --> 01:39:57,915
and pass the ammunition.

2014
01:39:58,023 --> 01:40:01,925
I am not wrong.

2015
01:40:01,994 --> 01:40:03,291
Neither am I wrong.

2016
01:40:05,097 --> 01:40:06,894
Oh, geez, the warbler!

2017
01:40:16,341 --> 01:40:17,672
No fair.

2018
01:40:17,743 --> 01:40:18,869
Shoot this prick,

2019
01:40:18,944 --> 01:40:19,968
will you?!

2020
01:40:23,548 --> 01:40:25,175
Shut up!

2021
01:40:51,276 --> 01:40:53,870
Don't, please.

2022
01:40:53,945 --> 01:40:54,877
Please, don't.

2023
01:40:54,946 --> 01:40:56,811
Shut your pie hole.

2024
01:40:57,883 --> 01:41:00,283
No, wait. That's murder.

2025
01:41:02,587 --> 01:41:04,282
You get a load of that?

2026
01:41:04,356 --> 01:41:06,017
Murder, he says.

2027
01:41:06,091 --> 01:41:07,422
I call it...

2028
01:41:07,492 --> 01:41:08,584
pruning.

2029
01:41:08,660 --> 01:41:11,857
Only one of us is going
to walk out of here.

2030
01:41:11,930 --> 01:41:13,761
Sweeter than the roses.

2031
01:41:16,835 --> 01:41:18,359
What, are you kidding me
with this?

2032
01:41:22,474 --> 01:41:24,066
Ah, shucks.

2033
01:41:24,142 --> 01:41:27,373
You could say we'd been
partners, him and me.

2034
01:41:27,446 --> 01:41:31,610
Like Laurel and Hardy
or Donald and lvana.

2035
01:41:31,683 --> 01:41:38,384
But, heck, this was
one sick pup, from way back.

2036
01:41:38,457 --> 01:41:42,188
And I reckon I'm man enough
to tie my own shoelaces now.

2037
01:42:05,150 --> 01:42:06,515
Hey.

2038
01:42:06,585 --> 01:42:10,487
You got my hat?

2039
01:42:10,555 --> 01:42:12,079
Have I got your hat?

2040
01:42:19,731 --> 01:42:21,995
I think I've cracked this case.

2041
01:42:23,602 --> 01:42:25,069
Yeah, I think you have, but...

2042
01:42:25,137 --> 01:42:26,661
No buts.

2043
01:42:26,738 --> 01:42:28,262
Watch my lips.

2044
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:29,364
What?

2045
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:35,273
In my dreams you told me

2046
01:42:35,347 --> 01:42:38,214
You really, really care

2047
01:42:38,283 --> 01:42:41,480
In my dreams you told me

2048
01:42:41,553 --> 01:42:44,420
It's a love
you want to share

2049
01:42:44,489 --> 01:42:47,754
So hold me, hold me, hold me

2050
01:42:47,826 --> 01:42:52,957
And never, ever let me go

2051
01:42:53,098 --> 01:42:55,965
Wah-wah-wah-wah

2052
01:42:56,034 --> 01:43:00,266
In my dreams you told me

2053
01:43:00,338 --> 01:43:03,239
Our love was here to stay

2054
01:43:03,308 --> 01:43:06,436
In my dreams you told me

2055
01:43:06,511 --> 01:43:09,480
Forever and a day

2056
01:43:09,548 --> 01:43:12,745
That you'll love me,
love me, love me

2057
01:43:12,817 --> 01:43:17,379
And never, ever let me go

2058
01:43:17,455 --> 01:43:21,687
Wah-wah-wah-wah

2059
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:27,665
It seems that dreams
are sometimes make believe

2060
01:43:27,732 --> 01:43:33,693
But now I know
that they are true

2061
01:43:33,772 --> 01:43:40,041
For in my dreams
you said you loved me

2062
01:43:40,111 --> 01:43:46,072
And in reality,
you love me, love me, too

2063
01:43:46,151 --> 01:43:49,382
Well, my dreams
have come true

2064
01:43:49,454 --> 01:43:52,548
I'm as happy as can be

2065
01:43:52,624 --> 01:43:55,650
For I know in my heart

2066
01:43:55,727 --> 01:43:58,628
You won't
take this love from me...

2067
01:44:07,138 --> 01:44:10,630
In my dreams you told me

2068
01:44:10,709 --> 01:44:13,906
That you really, really cared

2069
01:44:14,045 --> 01:44:17,640
In my dreams you told me

2070
01:44:17,716 --> 01:44:20,810
It's a love that can't compare

2071
01:44:20,885 --> 01:44:24,343
So hold me, hold me, hold me

2072
01:44:24,422 --> 01:44:30,258
And never, ever let me go

2073
01:44:34,966 --> 01:44:38,402
In my dreams you told me

2074
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:41,735
It's a love that can't compare

2075
01:44:41,806 --> 01:44:45,503
In my dreams you told me

2076
01:44:45,577 --> 01:44:48,740
It's a love you want to share

2077
01:44:48,813 --> 01:44:52,510
So hold me, hold me, hold me

2078
01:44:52,584 --> 01:44:58,386
Never, ever let me go

2079
01:45:02,727 --> 01:45:06,424
It seems that dreams

2080
01:45:06,498 --> 01:45:09,899
Are sometimes make-believe

2081
01:45:09,968 --> 01:45:15,736
But now I know
that they are real

2082
01:45:15,807 --> 01:45:23,578
For in my dreams
you said you loved me

2083
01:45:23,648 --> 01:45:28,984
And in reality, you love,
love me, too

2084
01:45:31,956 --> 01:45:35,915
Now my dreams have come true

2085
01:45:35,994 --> 01:45:39,191
I'm as happy as can be

2086
01:45:39,264 --> 01:45:42,722
For I know in my heart

2087
01:45:42,801 --> 01:45:46,168
You won't take this love
from me

2088
01:45:46,237 --> 01:45:50,230
Hold me, hold me, hold me

2089
01:45:50,308 --> 01:45:59,876
And never, ever let me go,
oh, oh, oh

2090
01:46:02,087 --> 01:46:07,252
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

2091
01:46:07,325 --> 01:46:13,889
Doo, doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo-doo

2092
01:46:14,032 --> 01:46:20,596
Doo, doo, doo, doo

2093
01:46:20,672 --> 01:46:24,472
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

2094
01:46:28,279 --> 01:46:31,442
It seems that dreams

2095
01:46:31,516 --> 01:46:34,815
Are sometimes make-believe

2096
01:46:34,886 --> 01:46:41,587
But now I know
that they are real

2097
01:46:41,659 --> 01:46:45,322
For in my dreams

2098
01:46:45,397 --> 01:46:48,764
You said you loved me

2099
01:46:48,833 --> 01:46:56,205
And in reality, you love,
love me, too

2100
01:47:00,812 --> 01:47:04,373
Now my dreams have come true

2101
01:47:04,449 --> 01:47:07,543
I'm as happy as can be

2102
01:47:07,619 --> 01:47:11,521
For I know in my heart

2103
01:47:11,589 --> 01:47:14,888
You won't take this love from me

2104
01:47:15,026 --> 01:47:18,689
So hold me, hold me, hold me

2105
01:47:18,763 --> 01:47:28,866
Never, ever let me go,
whoa, hoo.
