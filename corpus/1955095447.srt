1
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,180
Yes, I am happy for this opportunity.

2
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,780
And though some of my people
may not understand

3
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,008
the benefit of this,
I am sure they will in Cardiff.

4
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,300
They are fortunate to have
a leader with such resolve.

5
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,580
And now, let us stop
talking business, Mr. Prime Minister,

6
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,047
and drink the first water
from the plant.

7
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,251
- Thank you.
- Yes.

8
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,961
Thank you.

9
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,500
I hope this is the first
of many projects we can build.

10
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,490
We say the dragon of fortune
has a long tail.

11
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,683
- To Cardiff.
- To your new waterworks.

12
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,860
- It is our great honor.
- And ours.

13
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,260
All of us at Cardiff are so fortunate
to be doing business with you.

14
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,964
Yes. Thank you.

15
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,161
Mr. Prime Minister, thank you.

16
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,721
You sleeping?

17
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,180
Sweetie, what's going on?

18
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,620
Beeze.

19
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,961
Would you look at this?

20
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,571
I mean...

21
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:50,100
where did the energy come from suddenly?

22
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,850
Please. Oh, my God.

23
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,291
Are we there yet?

24
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,860
According to this, we only have
eleven more soul-crushing hours.

25
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,220
Oh, shit. You know you have to put
a dollar in the swear pot.

26
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,660
Uh-oh, guys.
I left the swear pot back in Texas.

27
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,082
- Shit! How could I have been so stupid.
- Dad. Dad! Jack.

28
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,806
- Where's Bob?
- Hey, what are you looking for?

29
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,727
- I can't find Bob.
- Did you look underneath?

30
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:24,684
You're not supposed to say
the S-H-I-T word.

31
00:05:24,684 --> 00:05:26,140
The what?

32
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,760
- Did you just spell that?
- Yes. No, you're not....

33
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,790
....supposed to say it. I am allowed to
say it under special emergency....

34
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,850
...circumstances. According to the rules...
Well, actually. And it wasn't....

35
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,100
....it wasn't an emergency.
...which I make up as I go along.

36
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,470
- Where did he go?
- Sweetie, don't bother that woman.

37
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,428
- I still don't see him.
- Okay.

38
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,445
Uh-oh.

39
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,567
- There you go.
- Hello, Bob. Thank you.

40
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,881
- How are you?
- Good.

41
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,363
- What happened to your hand?
- Mmm.

42
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,205
Got in a fight with a tiger.

43
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,300
- Really?
- Really.

44
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,447
Don't worry, though.

45
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,340
He got it worse than I did.

46
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,090
What happened to your head?

47
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,620
Oh... fell down a flight of stairs
in Hong Kong.

48
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,429
Okay, honey, come on, sit down.
Don't bother him. Okay?

49
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,128
- Sorry. Thank you.
- Pleasure.

50
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,980
What if we don't like it here?

51
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,740
Where we're going? I think we will.

52
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,650
What if this company goes belly-up too?

53
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,400
That's not going to happen,

54
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,740
because this company is a lot bigger
than Daddy's company was.

55
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,700
And that's better, huh?

56
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,801
Mm-hmm.

57
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,608
They promised us a car, right, babe?

58
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:54,980
Yeah, they did. But I don't...
So can you call someone?

59
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,260
Well, this phone's supposed to work
internationally, but it's not.

60
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,762
I don't see anything. I think
we're really starting strong here.

61
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,300
- Let's just grab one of these guys.
- Yeah, yeah. Okay, thank you. Yep.

62
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,780
Wait. A word to the wise here.

63
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,980
These guys are a bunch of scam artists.

64
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,420
They just wear uniforms
to look official,

65
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,500
but they're all rob you blind,
I promise you.

66
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,220
There's an official taxi line outside.

67
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,848
I will show you where if you like. Come on.
Great. Thank you. Or you will get ripped off.

68
00:07:21,848 --> 00:07:25,248
Don't worry, big boy. Don't worry.
Come over here. I will show you.

69
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,900
Here you go.

70
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,060
- You forgot your bags.
- No, this is it, kiddo.

71
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,300
I like to travel light.
You know what I mean?

72
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,860
Well, that's convenient.

73
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,060
- Where are you from?
- Austin, Texas.

74
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,100
- Expats? Who do you work for?
- Cardiff.

75
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,780
I am one of the engineers they brought
in to revamp the waterworks.

76
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,121
You Cardiff boys,
you go everywhere, don't you?

77
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,580
Where are you staying?
The Imperial Lotus?

78
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,340
- Yeah, how'd you know?
- Well, everyone does. I am there.

79
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,580
I will give you a lift, if you'd like.
I am meeting someone.

80
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,340
- Would you like that?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

81
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,180
Be my pleasure. Be my pleasure.

82
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,500
- Hammond's the name.
- Jack.

83
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,380
Nice to meet you, Jack. Nice to see you. Hi, I am
Annie. How are you? Hello, Annie, how are you?

84
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,900
This is Lucy, Briegel.

85
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,260
- But you can call her Beeze.
- Hello, Beeze.

86
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,900
- Do you like it here?
- I love it.

87
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,780
I have been here 15 times.

88
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,140
- Wow!
- That's a lot of times.

89
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,380
Yeah, it is a lot of times.
Well, I just love it.

90
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,700
I love the women.

91
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,900
They're always so eager to please,
you know what I mean?

92
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,780
Okay. It's interesting,

93
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,620
I am looking at our bags
and I am thinking that we're too many...

94
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,380
No are you kidding?
...pieces of luggage.

95
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,289
I think that we could maybe
just get a taxi... No...

96
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:31,165
...don't worry about these guys.
They can fit everything on a moped.

97
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,860
It will be great.

98
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,848
Okay, everybody, here's your ride,
right here.

99
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,420
This is the man!

100
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,780
- Come on.
- You're in safe hands here.

101
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,500
- I missed you.
- Look at you!

102
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,046
There you go.
Mind the leg. Mind the leg.

103
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,940
Good to see you.
These good folks here, they need a lift.

104
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,140
Their ride didn't show up.

105
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,990
Yes, okay. Thanks.
But I need to ask you very important question.

106
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,140
Okay.

107
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,449
- Do you like Kenny Roger?
- Kenny Rogers?

108
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,247
- Yes, of course. Yes. Yes? Yes. Yeah.
- Because this is the Kenny Roger cab.

109
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,060
Oh, my God! I had no idea.

110
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:18,260
My name is
Samnang Pichairongkramgiskerong.

111
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,220
- Wow! I like your name.
- Jack.

112
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,300
Yeah? But all my friends call me...
Kenny Roger.

113
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,020
- Oh, Kenny.
- That's a little easier.

114
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,980
Because we look alike.

115
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,206
You do?

116
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,820
- Uncanny.
- Whoa! Separated at birth!

117
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,331
- Let's go.
- Here we go.

118
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,340
- Let's go. Come on.
- Here we go. I have got the birds.

119
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,820
Hey, Kenny Rogers, you mind
keeping your eye on the road a little bit?

120
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,340
Thank you.

121
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,400
- This one's on us, okay? Okay. Thank you.
- All right. Be safe. All right. You go.

122
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,440
Okay.

123
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,980
- This one's pretty. Daddy, look, it's you.
- Oh, wow! It's your serious face.

124
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,721
I would have preferred a driver,
but it's a nice welcome.

125
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,460
Dad, this light doesn't work.

126
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,220
What do you mean it doesn't work?

127
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,900
I got Bob.

128
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,500
Okay. Nope, it doesn't work.
You're right.

129
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,760
But I got to say, I am loving
how unpredictable this hotel is.

130
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,300
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

131
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,300
Because a lot of places you turn on
a switch, you know the light comes on.

132
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,483
Here, there's some, like, mystery.
There's a little suspense.

133
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,244
Annie, speaking of a mystery, what is...

134
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,860
- What is this?
- It's my rice cooker.

135
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,340
I know, but we're in Asia.

136
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,620
Don't you think they're going to have
some effective ways to cook rice?

137
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,540
This is my rice cooker.

138
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,180
Okay. Let's show them how we do it.

139
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,780
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

140
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,500
- All right.
- I want to go swimming.

141
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,120
No, no, no, we can't go swimming.
In fact, you got to get ready for bed.

142
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,150
I am not tired,
and I really want to go swimming.

143
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,220
Okay, okay, I will make a deal with you guys.

144
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,060
We will start to wind the engines down.

145
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,482
You guys can sit here quietly
and watch some TV.

146
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,020
We're not getting any channels.

147
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,740
- Did you...?
- We're getting snow.

148
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,100
Nothing's working!

149
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,140
All right, let's not be difficult.

150
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,660
Lucy's always been difficult.

151
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,427
Since the day she was born,
she's been very difficult.

152
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,060
Dad. Guys. Guys. Dad, will you tell
the story of how Lucy was born?

153
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,100
- Yeah. Sure.
- You guys like that story, don't you?

154
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,207
Well, I got to say, it was a difficult birth.
I knew it! Good difficult. Good difficult.

155
00:12:40,207 --> 00:12:42,640
Do you want to call about the television?
No, no, no.

156
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,980
I will call.
I will tell you the story. Hold on.

157
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,650
Not difficult! Not difficult!
The phone's not working.

158
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,927
Okay, welcome to the Third World.

159
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:54,380
It's actually the Fourth World.

160
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,300
Really? That's what it said in the book.
I didn't even know that existed. Nor did I.

161
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,820
You didn't plug in the rice cooker.
Could that have...

162
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,980
...possibly shorted out everything?
No. You're a jerk.

163
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,740
- It's happening in the whole city.
- What's happening?

164
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,340
There's no TV or Internet
in the whole city?

165
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,500
I am afraid not, sir.
Have you gotten any calls for me from Cardiff?

166
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,980
Jack Dwyer.
Are the phones working?

167
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,980
The phones are working, sir. Okay.
But we have no calls from Cardiff for you.

168
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,740
- No calls?
- Maybe better luck in the morning.

169
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,080
Okay. Thank you.

170
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,921
All right, here we go.
Here we go, here it comes.

171
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:36,220
Can I get a beer?

172
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,883
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

173
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,051
Thank you!

174
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,540
- That was great.
- Sitting over here all on your lonesome.

175
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,780
You have got all jet-lagged, have you?
Yeah, I am in a little bit of a fog.

176
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,860
What about you?

177
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,660
Do I look like a guy who's jet-lagged?

178
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,380
- No.
- No, no.

179
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,220
All that shit's in the mind, mate.

180
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,300
- It's all up here.
- Yep. You're right, it is. Yeah.

181
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,122
Bullshit. Joe. Joe, two shots.
Here you go.

182
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,540
I think I am... I am just going to stick with
a beer. No, it's not for you. It's for me.

183
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,481
Here we go.

184
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,565
Is that guy playing a Casio keyboard
on top of a grand piano?

185
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,580
Welcome to Asia.
You're going to love it here.

186
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,180
- Really? There's just so much to do.
- Well, I don't know.

187
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,900
Ten years ago
I could not have pictured myself

188
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:51,860
dragging my family the other side of the
world to start over in some mid-management job.

189
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,860
At least you're making a good living.

190
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,389
<i>And.....
Doing good.</i>

191
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,380
Yeah.

192
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,420
I know the bill of goods
those Cardiff boys sell you.

193
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,140
You got something against
clean drinking water?

194
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,241
Apparently.

195
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,720
Maybe I do need a shot.

196
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,260
No, you don't. No, you don't.
You got the kids upstairs.

197
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,380
So what did you do, anyway?
In your better days.

198
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,860
I invented a valve.

199
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,940
Ah...

200
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,660
I know it doesn't sound very sexy,
but it was. No. No, it doesn't.

201
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,129
No, but we came up with this valve
that was almost a big deal.

202
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,091
Came very close.

203
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,645
Here's to almost.

204
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,060
- Almost.
- Almost.

205
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,400
Cheers.

206
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,100
What about you?
You have any kids or anything?

207
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,850
No.

208
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,490
No. Not anymore.

209
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,566
I guess...

210
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,180
I guess I have seen better days, too.
Yeah.

211
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,740
On that note, I think
I am going to hit a strip joint.

212
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,604
- All right.
- Yeah.

213
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,060
Perhaps I should change
into my sweatpants.

214
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,700
Yeah, let them know I mean business.

215
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,340
Oh, yeah.

216
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,340
Listen, don't let the bastards
get you down, okay?

217
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,526
- All right. Thank you.
- Of course. Yeah. See you.

218
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,180
Hon, are you okay? Are you sick?
No. What are you doing?

219
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,184
I am just tired.
I just...

220
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,042
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

221
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,286
No.

222
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,380
Annie, I am sorry I didn't...
I wasn't trying to fool you with this.

223
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,940
It's okay. I know I just... I wasn't
planning for things to work out like this,

224
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,680
but I thought that
this is the best option available.

225
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,380
- Jack, I can't.
- I know. And I am doing the best...

226
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,123
- I can't comfort you right now.
- No, I know. I am not...

227
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,961
All right.

228
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,131
Any word from Cardiff? Jack Dwyer.

229
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,404
I am afraid not, sir. I am very sorry.

230
00:18:49,404 --> 00:18:51,660
Do you have a newspaper?

231
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,180
Our delivery did not come in
today, sir. We have none.

232
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,700
Is there some place I can go to get one?

233
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,780
Yes. Yes, you can go to Kampuchea Krom.

234
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,008
Okay. I don't know where that is.

235
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,260
This is where we are,
and this is Kampuchea Krom.

236
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,580
When you get to Mao Tse-Tung,
you turn right. But only half.

237
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,540
- Only half.
- Yeah.

238
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,980
Newspapers, sir.

239
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,684
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

240
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,730
Do you have any newspapers in English?

241
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,928
Do you have The Herald Tribune
or USA Today?

242
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,647
Do you have any American newspapers?

243
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,401
Great.

244
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,401
Thank you.

245
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,289
This is from three days ago.
Do you have one that's newer?

246
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,361
Thanks.

247
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,686
Go, go, go!

248
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,925
What's happening? I am an American.

249
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,160
Get your fucking hands off of me!
Let go of me!

250
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,020
Get your hands off of me!
Let me go!

251
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,180
They're coming into the hotel.

252
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,406
It's not safe.

253
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,540
Put the table there.

254
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,906
Bring more chairs. Sir, please go back
to your rooms until the situation is over.

255
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,011
Are you going to even use your goggles?
I feel like you never use it.

256
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,580
- Annie? Coming, coming.
- Annie, open up.

257
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,620
- Are you okay? Yeah, I am fine.
- Is something wrong? Lock the door. OK.

258
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,500
Ok. There's like a war going on out there.
What? Come here look.

259
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,220
- Honey, slow down.
- Look, look, you see that?

260
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,500
- They're overrunning the police.
- I don't see anything.

261
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,860
- Come here. Here, look.
- You're scaring me, stop it.

262
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,566
- Can you see that smoke?
- What? No! I don't see anything. Annie.

263
00:28:26,566 --> 00:28:28,340
Annie, they are killing people.

264
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,442
They are pulling them out
and just shooting them.

265
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,600
Foreigners. Why? Just out there. You saw
the people... I don't know what's going on.

266
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,140
They just shot a guy right in front of me.

267
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:40,630
Please! Annie, they are here in the hotel.
They're in the lobby.

268
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,441
Where's Lucy?

269
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,140
- Lucy?
- Lucy?

270
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,340
- Lucy? She was right here.
- Lucy? Lucy, right now. She left.

271
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,930
What do you mean she left?

272
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,944
- Where did she go?
- She went to the pool.

273
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,980
You let her go to the pool by herself?
No, I didn't let her go down by herself.

274
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,180
- She's been acting out.
- Stay here and lock the door.

275
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,940
- Are you sure?
- Lock the door. Lock the door!

276
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,644
Wait!

277
00:29:04,644 --> 00:29:07,081
- It's fourth floor. Fourth floor.
- Shut the door.

278
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,780
Okay, let's go put on
different clothes, honey. Okay?

279
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,120
It's all right, don't be scared.

280
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,660
Here we go.

281
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,411
Finish the other one.

282
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,380
You know what, Briegel?

283
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,244
Get in the bathroom
and lock the door, please.

284
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,321
Now.

285
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,340
Get out! Get out!

286
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,448
Leave them alone! Leave them alone!

287
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,169
No, leave them alone.

288
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,401
No...

289
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,131
Mommy?

290
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,121
- Bathroom, Beeze.
- Now.

291
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,841
Lucy?

292
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,841
Lucy?

293
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,845
Lucy?

294
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,530
Get out of the pool. Come here.

295
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,804
Get out of the pool.

296
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,361
Come here.

297
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,010
- Get to the roof!
- Go!

298
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,925
Get up to the roof.

299
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,420
Annie?

300
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,443
- Jack.
- Annie, open up.

301
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,521
Jack.

302
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,084
- Shit.
- What the hell happened?

303
00:33:37,084 --> 00:33:39,580
She's okay, she's okay.

304
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,806
We got to get out.

305
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,060
Annie, we got to get to the roof.

306
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,700
- Come here.
- We can't, we can't leave here.

307
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,080
They are out there, Jack.

308
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,820
No, we just came... We just came on this floor.
We can stay here.

309
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,060
- Trust me.
- We got to get them to the roof.

310
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:58,807
Okay? We have to go now, trust me.
Please. Okay?

311
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,461
- Okay.
- We got to go.

312
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,890
- Mom! Mommy, Bob!
- No, no!

313
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,740
No, come on.

314
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,060
No!

315
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,500
- No, no.
- Stop it.

316
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,250
No. Come on, go, go, go.

317
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,924
Oh, my God! It's okay.

318
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,241
Close your eyes.

319
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,450
Here we are.

320
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,690
Hold the door. Don't let him through.
Open up. We're Americans, open up.

321
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,086
I am going to sit over there.

322
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,620
- Are you okay?
- Okay. Here.

323
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,260
- You okay?
- Are you all right? Good.

324
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,260
Good! You girls are very good.

325
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,169
- Let me just see what's going on.
- Yeah, yeah.

326
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,420
- You know what's happening?
- We have no Idea.

327
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,340
Does somebody know we're up on the roof?

328
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,900
- I hope so.
- Can you get a signal?

329
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,570
- I wasn't getting a signal.
- It's not working.

330
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:07,340
Someone over there said
the prime minister has been killed.

331
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,060
Don't go near there mate.

332
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,049
Stay back. They will take a shot at you.

333
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,000
What are they screaming?

334
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,460
I don't know. It's some crazy fuck
down there. He's gone ballistic.

335
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,740
We will just hold the roof.

336
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,460
We will kill any of those fuckers
who try to come up here.

337
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,940
Hold on, my wife speaks French.

338
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,460
Hey, Annie, this guy's
speaking French. Can you...

339
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,840
Hold on, hold on.

340
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,300
Okay.

341
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,609
- What's he saying?
- He's telling me, don't resist.

342
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,980
There's no prisoners because
they're going to kill us anyway.

343
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,500
They keep saying it over and over again.

344
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,060
Blood for water. Blood for water?

345
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:57,369
What does that mean? I don't....
He doesn't know. He will know, the bellhop.

346
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,540
Hey, mate, what does
"blood for water" mean?

347
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,120
They're shouting out "blood for water."
What does it mean?

348
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,361
Americans take over our water company,
and they don't like it.

349
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,725
- Listen, guys, we just got a whole...
- Cardiff?

350
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,140
Is he talking about Cardiff?
Did you know anything about this?

351
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,246
Of course not.
I thought we were here to help. Dad?

352
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,820
- Are people trying to kill us?
- No, they're not trying to kill us.

353
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,780
They're just...
Lucy, there are people trying to hurt us...

354
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,690
...down below. That's why we came up. No...
Jack, please, don't tell her that. It doesn't help.

355
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,580
...I don't want to pretend this isn't happening.
It doesn't help...

356
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,020
We're going to stick together,

357
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,265
and you just listen to what your mom says,
and you watch out for your little sister.

358
00:37:35,265 --> 00:37:37,860
- Why are people trying to kill us?
- I don't know, they just are.

359
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,600
You need to keep an eye out on Beeze,

360
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,060
because she's your little sister
and she needs your help all right?

361
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,300
We just wait here
and then help is going to come.

362
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,940
Can you hear the helicopter?

363
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,340
Jack, do you hear that?
Is that a helicopter?

364
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,220
Okay, here, you hear that?

365
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,940
- Yeah, that's a helicopter.
- We're getting out of here.

366
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,761
See, everything is going to be okay.
Okay, right?

367
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:03,500
- Yeah! You okay? Right? Are you hurt?
- You made me leave Bob.

368
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,340
- All right.
- We will get you another Bob.

369
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,860
I don't want a new Bob.

370
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,380
- All right.
- It's been a long day.

371
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,380
You didn't even say what the deal is?

372
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,900
Okay, how about this deal?

373
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,287
We will get you a dog.
We will get you a new puppy, all right?

374
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,367
- A bulldog?
- Yeah, a bulldog.

375
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,286
An ugly one?

376
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,980
Ugliest one you have ever seen.

377
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,244
<i>- Deal.
- Deal.</i>

378
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,601
See it?

379
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,300
Get down.

380
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,686
Keep your head down.

381
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,244
You okay? You okay?

382
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,446
Wait, Jack. Jack?
What are we doing?

383
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,645
Jack, what are you doing?

384
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,569
Shit!
Come here. Come here. Come here.

385
00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:15,980
We will get to the other side. I got you.

386
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,411
- Go, go, go.
- You got it. Go, go, go.

387
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,602
- Move.
- Okay, over here.

388
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,780
- Stay down.
- Stay right here, okay?

389
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,860
Get under here.

390
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,007
What?

391
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,950
- We got to get over to that roof.
- What?

392
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,100
- No, no fucking way. Annie, listen to me.
- What are we going to do?

393
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,766
We got to do it. They're going to come.
We're going to hide there.

394
00:40:45,766 --> 00:40:47,860
No.
When they get through that, that's it.

395
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,280
- We're dead. Jack, no.
- Okay, over there we have a chance.

396
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,820
Over there? We don't know what's there. Over
there, they're going to be the same kind of people.

397
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:56,260
All I know is, we got to keep putting
ten steps between us and them. Okay?

398
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:00,140
If we stay here they will kill us.
Jack come on. That's crazy, that's fucking crazy.

399
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,402
Look at me,
we're going to fucking die here.

400
00:41:02,402 --> 00:41:05,820
Listen to me, we don't have a choice.
Please, we don't have a choice.

401
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,180
- How?
- You're going to jump first,

402
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,420
and then I am going to throw the kids over
one at a time.

403
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,081
Then I am going to follow, okay?

404
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,608
Come on. You can do this. Okay.
How? How? Come on. Right here.

405
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,500
Just get up here.

406
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,011
Right here.

407
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:22,980
You're going to get a good running start,
and then you just jump it, okay?

408
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,900
- Okay.
- Don't do it, Mommy.

409
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,260
Stop, stop. Get away.
Stop. Stop, she can do it.

410
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,566
Go, go.

411
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,500
Shit!

412
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,541
- I can't, I can't.
- What are you doing? Yes, you can.

413
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,700
Annie, look at me. Just do it. Don't think
about it. Stop yelling at me, Jack. Okay?

414
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:01,260
Don't think about it. Look at me. Don't do it,
Mommy! Look at me. Mommy! Oh, man, I am scared.

415
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,201
You okay?

416
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,300
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

417
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,220
Okay, I am going to send the Beeze over.

418
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,260
- No! No.
- She's okay.

419
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,900
I need you to close your eyes
for a second.

420
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,002
- No, don't do it.
- Okay.

421
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,900
I don't want you to throw me to Mommy. Okay.
I am not going to do it. All right?

422
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,525
What's the name
of your bulldog going to be?

423
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,660
- Chow-chow.
- Is that a better name than Winston?

424
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,411
- You think?
- No!

425
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,329
Briegel, you okay, honey?

426
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,980
Good girl.

427
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,081
Come on.

428
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,340
No.

429
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,060
- Lucy.
- No.

430
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:07,140
- Lucy, come here.
- No! Listen to me.

431
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,140
Listen, I got to get you to that roof.

432
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,242
No. If I don't, those bad people
are going to hurt you. No.

433
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,086
Okay, come here.

434
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,991
- No. No!
- You can, I know.

435
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,270
<i>No.....</i>

436
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,766
Daddy!

437
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,420
Jack!

438
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,260
- Pull up.
- Don't drop me!

439
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,362
Hold on, grab my arm. Grab it.

440
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,660
Come on. Pull.

441
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,524
Pull.

442
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,620
Lucy, we almost went over.

443
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,180
Listen to me. If I tell you
to do something, you got to do it.

444
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,123
- Okay?
- I am scared.

445
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,625
I know, I am scared too.

446
00:43:57,625 --> 00:44:00,121
Okay, but it's going to be okay.
Just close your eyes.

447
00:44:00,121 --> 00:44:01,287
No.

448
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,820
- No.
- Lucy.

449
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,126
No!

450
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,081
Honey, are you okay?

451
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,700
You all right?

452
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,370
Okay, okay.

453
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:34,111
It's okay. Get your breath, come on.
Good girls.

454
00:44:34,111 --> 00:44:37,206
- Good girls.
- I am so sorry.

455
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,981
<i>Okay.</i>

456
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,005
- Are you okay?
- Yep, I am fine. Okay, go, underneath.

457
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,640
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes. Okay. All right.

458
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,121
Goddamn it.

459
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,726
Shit!

460
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,020
Right here. We can get down here.

461
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,340
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

462
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,860
- Just ten more steps.
- Ten more steps.

463
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,900
- Just ten more steps.
- Ten more steps. Go, go.

464
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,365
Go, go, go...

465
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,370
Okay, send Lucy down.

466
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,408
Okay, I got her.

467
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:55,444
You okay? Yeah. Okay, again, here we go.
I got you. I got you. Okay, let her go.

468
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,721
Okay.

469
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,580
Go. Come on. Okay.
Put your foot right there. I got you. Yeah.

470
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,664
There we go. Over here.

471
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,245
Down, down, honey. Down.

472
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,847
Sit down for a second.

473
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,441
Okay.

474
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,846
Are you okay?

475
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,940
Are you okay? Yeah.
We're going to get through this, okay?

476
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,166
I know.

477
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,606
Lucy, you okay?

478
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,204
- Okay.
- Beeze, you all right?

479
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,180
Briegel. Honey.
Beeze, will you look at me?

480
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,248
I want to go home.

481
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,561
I know.

482
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,820
Dad, can you tell us the story
about when I was born.

483
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,340
No, not right now honey.

484
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,646
I will tell you later.

485
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,961
I am hungry.

486
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,300
Hi, hungry. I am Dad.

487
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,140
That's not funny.

488
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,100
I am not funny, I am Dad.

489
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,770
Still not funny.

490
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,500
I think you're funny.

491
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,900
And that's why you're my favorite.

492
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,286
- That's mean.
- I mean, both of you.

493
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,247
- Both of you.
- Dad!

494
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,604
Come here.

495
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,324
Get down.
Keep down, keep down, keep down.

496
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,940
There's a tank out there.
We need to move.

497
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,087
What?

498
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,929
Come on, there's a tank.

499
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,323
In here.

500
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,881
Go! Go!

501
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,540
- Okay? You okay?
- Yeah.

502
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,060
Honey, you okay?

503
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,070
Get back, get back.
Go.

504
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,086
Get back.

505
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,460
Jack? Oh... oh, shit!

506
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,220
In here, in here.

507
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,410
They're gone. It's okay, they're gone.

508
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:43,049
Mommy, I have to go potty.

509
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,090
Just... It's okay.
Just go in your pants, okay.

510
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,964
But... I am not a baby.

511
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,101
I know, I know sweetheart. I know that.
I know.

512
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,611
Just this one time, okay.
But...

513
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,924
I promise it's okay.

514
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,681
It's okay, Beeze.

515
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,247
It's okay.

516
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,649
Do you know how much I love you?

517
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,007
You know, I love you.

518
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,080
Jack, nobody even knows we're here.

519
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,325
Nobody's going to come to help us.

520
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,020
We got to get ourselves
to the American Embassy.

521
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:59,081
That's what we're going to do.
We can do that. Okay?

522
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,421
- We're going to get there.
- Okay.

523
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,571
Okay, I know, I know.
Come here honey. Are you okay?

524
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,866
- Here you go.
- We can't go out like this, honey.

525
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,921
Let me get something for us to put on.
Okay.

526
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,366
Let me look around.

527
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,670
Don't look.
Please, don't look.

528
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,485
Come here. Don't look.

529
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,882
Don't look down.

530
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,685
- I don't like it here.
- I know.

531
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,767
Just stay put. Stay put.

532
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,651
Can't read this. Can't read this map.

533
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,126
- What are you looking for?
- The Embassy.

534
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,046
- Mom, look.
- What? An American flag.

535
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,603
Very good, very good.

536
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,810
Jack...

537
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,780
Okay, so here's the American Embassy,

538
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,300
but do you know
where we are on this map?

539
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,140
We're right here, right about here.

540
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:20,060
Okay, that's, like, five blocks away
and I think...

541
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,844
Shut up.

542
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,621
<i>Quiet.</i>

543
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,286
Stop it.

544
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,767
Okay?

545
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,131
You can't scream.

546
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,207
You can't.

547
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,441
No!

548
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,644
Ten more steps.

549
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,208
Let me get the clothes.

550
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,460
- Hey...
- Hey.

551
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,766
Come on.

552
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,889
Couple more blocks.

553
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,210
Take a right here.

554
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,481
<i>Jack....</i>

555
00:59:04,481 --> 00:59:09,620
Turn around, turn around Jack. Where?
Don't do it. We go back where we came from.

556
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,000
You guys, put your head down.
Pull it over.

557
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,140
Jack... We can't, get your head down.
Stay down, stay down. Jack, please. Please.

558
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,211
Get your head down. Tuck your head in.

559
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,327
I am slipping.

560
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,084
<i>- Right here?
- Yeah.</i>

561
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,140
- Okay.
- I can get up right here.

562
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:34,620
- Let's go.
- No. No, we're here. We got to go over.

563
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:39,120
- This doesn't look like it. Why?
- No, no, they put this up as a defense.

564
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,802
I don't hear anything.

565
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,500
- Okay, let me take a look.
- Can I come?

566
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,460
Get behind...
No, no, listen to your mom.

567
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:48,291
- Get behind. I am going to take a look.
- What are you going to do?

568
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,770
Be careful.

569
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,970
You okay?

570
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,020
You see anything?

571
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:03,364
- Hold on, let me get a better look.
- Okay.

572
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,545
<i>Daddy....</i>

573
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,661
<i>Jack!</i>

574
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,060
Daddy!

575
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:25,480
Annie....
Annie.....

576
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,650
Over here!

577
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,081
Come on.

578
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,360
Come here.

579
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:17,990
- Okay, okay. Okay.
- Hey, hey.... No, no.

580
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,102
<i>Please..... family.</i>

581
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,409
Please, family.

582
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,041
Please.

583
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,740
It's okay, okay.

584
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:37,126
Stick close.

585
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,364
Lucy, get down.

586
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,327
We don't know where. We find you.

587
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:53,005
We need that gun, wait here.

588
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,996
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

589
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,049
Don't know where. We find you.

590
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,247
Find you, I kill you.

591
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:49,851
<i>Oh, Jack, hide.</i>

592
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:54,401
Oh, my God!
They will see him. Shit!

593
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,460
Okay, girls, girls, Daddy needs help.

594
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:11,260
No matter what you hear,
you don't move from here.

595
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,361
Okay?

596
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,246
Okay.

597
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:30,620
Hey, okay, okay. Hey, I am right here.

598
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,860
Okay, okay.

599
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,500
Jack, grab it!

600
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,440
- Hey, fuckhead!
- Hey!

601
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,431
Jack!

602
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,720
- No....
- No.....

603
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,970
No....

604
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,470
No....

605
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,780
No, no, no!

606
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:41,680
Get the fuck of me!

607
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,531
Fucking kill...

608
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:55,420
No! No!
I will fucking kill you!

609
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:58,764
Goddamn it!
Oh, my God!

610
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,820
Wait! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

611
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:08,660
Don't shoot! I got money.

612
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:14,540
Wait, wait, I have money. I got money.
I got money, I got guns. I got guns....

613
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,900
I can get guns. I can get guns.

614
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:22,500
Sung, Sung. Everyone likes Sung.

615
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,285
I have got one, three and five,
you have got two and six!

616
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,081
Shit!

617
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,140
Oh, my God!

618
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:53,740
I am okay.

619
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:56,690
- I said I got one, three and five.
- Yeah, but that three there.

620
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:58,580
That guy over there is three.

621
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:01,420
- From your position, that's two.
- No, it's not.

622
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:04,471
The clock is based on my head,
not on my feet.

623
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,531
- You happy now?
- That's good enough.

624
01:10:09,531 --> 01:10:11,860
All right, quickly, come on.
Everyone go.

625
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:13,460
- We have got to get out of here right now.
- Get the girls.

626
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:15,780
That guy is going to come back,
and he will bring friends.

627
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:18,140
- Now hurry. Come on.
- There's more coming. Come on.

628
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,380
- Quickly.
- It's okay, it's okay, come on.

629
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:22,580
There's a house I know
a few blocks from here.

630
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:25,047
- We will be safe for the night.
- I am right here honey.

631
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,785
- Mommy!
- Mommy!

632
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:29,580
Hurry!

633
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:31,380
I will buy you some time.

634
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:34,529
- Okay.
- Come on, come on.

635
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,881
Let's go.

636
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:44,643
- Come on. No, I don't want to!
- Lucy. I don't want to go. Lucy.

637
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:50,526
This is no time to discuss this, okay.
Look at me, look at me, look at me.

638
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,120
My daughter gave me this
the last time I saw her,

639
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:59,980
and she said nothing bad would ever
happen to me as long as I wear it.

640
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:03,020
I'd like you to take it. Okay.

641
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:06,460
Okay, you're safe now.
No matter what, okay.

642
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:09,060
- What about Beeze?
- It will work for Beeze.

643
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:11,220
It will work for both of you.
There's nothing to be scared of.

644
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:12,700
You're safe now, okay?

645
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:15,820
Stay quiet, stay fast,
and stay close. Okay.

646
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:18,851
You hurt? You have got blood right here.
Oh, that's not mine.

647
01:11:18,851 --> 01:11:21,961
- Come on.
- Okay, come on. Okay. Come on.

648
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,740
Here we go.

649
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:29,500
Keep up now, come on.

650
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,489
Here we go, upstairs.

651
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,220
- Kosal.
- Hey, Hammond.

652
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:16,220
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

653
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:17,780
Listen....

654
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:21,240
we're going to spend the night here, okay?
Okay. Good, good. Are you okay?

655
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,680
Would you care for some tea?

656
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:26,127
Yeah, a cup of tea would be nice,
maybe a drop of the hard stuff.

657
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,485
You smell lovely.

658
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,700
All right, through here.

659
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:37,740
Here we go, family.

660
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:39,820
- All right.
- It's okay, it's okay.

661
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:41,763
Out onto the roof.

662
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,420
We made it.

663
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:53,602
Glad to see you're
all in one piece, Kenny.

664
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:55,460
Come on up, everyone.

665
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:56,991
Come on, here we are.

666
01:12:56,991 --> 01:13:01,060
Ah, you guys must be starving.
There's enough food here for everyone.

667
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:02,780
Come on, come sit down.

668
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:05,487
<i>- Good?
- Nice.</i>

669
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,001
Well done.

670
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:11,740
You like it?

671
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:14,260
- What is it?
- "What is it?"

672
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:17,001
You mean to tell me you haven't had
Kan Chow Chicken yet?

673
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,380
You're going to love this.

674
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,060
They feed the chicken's raisins.

675
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:25,140
- Really?
- Really. Makes the chickens taste sweet.

676
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:27,180
Raisins? That's interesting.

677
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:29,620
What do they the feed
the chickens in the US?

678
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:31,529
In the US?

679
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,931
Usually other chickens, I think.

680
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:42,660
Okay, Mom, Dad, can I have a word with you?
Just over here. Yeah, yes.

681
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:44,683
- You should eat something.
- Come on.

682
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,421
<i>- Okay.
- Eat.</i>

683
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,460
- You see the river there?
- Yeah.

684
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:58,700
The Vietnamese border
is a couple of miles downstream.

685
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,540
If we can just get across,
they will have to give us asylum.

686
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:04,460
And then we can leave
all this behind us.

687
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:06,061
- All right?
- Yeah.

688
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:07,801
Hammond, thank you.

689
01:14:07,801 --> 01:14:10,260
My pleasure, my pleasure, don't worry.

690
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,442
Jack I am going to go check on the kids.

691
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,606
You're not just here
for the girls are you?

692
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,020
Nah.

693
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:22,580
Well... maybe a little.

694
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,540
You British CIA or something?

695
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:30,860
- Something like that.
- And Kenny he's...

696
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:32,200
Mm-hmm.

697
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,460
- Thanks.
- Nah.

698
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:43,100
No, thanks for coming along when you did. Don't
thank me. I am the one who started this shit storm!

699
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:44,460
What do you mean?

700
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:48,940
Guys like me pave the way
for guys like you to wind up here.

701
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:51,300
They don't usually fight back.

702
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:54,140
Most of the time, they don't
even realize what we're doing.

703
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:57,005
- Why? What do you mean?
- We...

704
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,780
have interests in this region.

705
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:02,087
- We?
- Our countries.

706
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:06,940
The corporations
who run them have interests here.

707
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:09,566
So I show up all nice and friendly,

708
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:13,620
offering to get them
a loan to pay for our services,

709
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:15,540
which we know they can't afford.

710
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,820
Then we build them power plants,

711
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:20,780
waterworks, freeways...
It doesn't really matter.

712
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:23,486
And when they can't repay us the debt...

713
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,766
we own them.

714
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,528
It's all a fuck job.

715
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:39,100
The rebel leaders said we were trying to enslave
their people by controlling the waterworks.

716
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:40,820
And they were right.

717
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:44,100
Most of those merciless men out there...

718
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,407
they're just trying to
protect their children,

719
01:15:46,407 --> 01:15:48,060
just like you.

720
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,650
So don't thank me.

721
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,620
I am the one who put your
family in harm's way.

722
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:56,405
Least I can do is get you
out of the bloody place.

723
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,624
Is that Kan Chow Chicken there?

724
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:06,680
- Looks like dog.
- You need your strength, Jack.

725
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,750
They need your strength too, mate.

726
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,740
Raisins?

727
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:13,001
Seemed like a nice touch.

728
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,130
I killed someone.

729
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,940
You're alive, Jack.

730
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:26,180
Your family's alive.

731
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:28,647
There's no good
or bad here, there's only...

732
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:32,247
just get your family the hell out.

733
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,286
Come on.

734
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,603
Get some sleep. We leave in four hours.

735
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,601
You all right?

736
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,723
In hindsight, I probably didn't need
to bring the rice-cooker.

737
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:19,410
Are you kidding me?
We couldn't leave that behind.

738
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,220
Thank you for sticking with me
the last few years

739
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:29,780
because I know it's not what you wanted,

740
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:32,008
what you hoped for.

741
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,003
If my life had been the way I wanted...

742
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,727
I'd be in Paris.

743
01:17:39,727 --> 01:17:43,060
I'd be in a flat in Saint-Sulpice.

744
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:44,660
Drinking wine.

745
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,842
Sounds pretty good.

746
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:54,044
But then I wouldn't have met you.

747
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,926
And I wouldn't know
those beautiful girls.

748
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,851
And the profound...

749
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,843
thing it is to be their mother.

750
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:13,321
This life...

751
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,521
has been so much more...

752
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,380
than anything that I could have...

753
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:24,450
wanted or planned.

754
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:33,041
If we die here tomorrow,
it will have been worth it.

755
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:44,322
Look at me...

756
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:49,140
No one's going to die here.

757
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,900
Get to the wall, get to the wall.

758
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,684
Get down, get down, get down.

759
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,820
Okay, okay, there's
a gun tower across the street,

760
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:34,524
stay low.

761
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,500
There's four of them in the tower.
Now I am going to draw fire.

762
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,140
I want you to run
like hell for that staircase.

763
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:43,580
Do you understand me?

764
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:47,630
- You ready? Wait, wait.
- You ready? Okay. Go!

765
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:24,083
Come on. Come on. No!
That door! Go to that door!

766
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,281
Oh, God!

767
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,485
God!

768
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:16,927
- Keep going! Come on.
- Get across the border.

769
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:26,182
Just go.
You will have some better days, Jack.

770
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,725
Keep going! Go!

771
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:59,290
- Too bad I couldn't make it!
- Shit! God!

772
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,365
Wait for it.

773
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,206
Wait for it.

774
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,900
Wait for it!

775
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:23,241
Come to papa, fucker!

776
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,606
Fucker!

777
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,180
Wait. Wait.

778
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:50,170
- Hang on.
- Hang on.

779
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,370
What are we going to do now?

780
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,646
I don't know. Okay.

781
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,041
I don't know.

782
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:00,841
What are we going to do?

783
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,041
I don't know.

784
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:18,521
Annie.

785
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:20,771
Jack.

786
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:27,090
<i>- Jack.
- Jack.</i>

787
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,569
Look at me. It's okay.

788
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:33,361
Ten more steps, remember, Jack?
Stay with me.

789
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,680
Stay with me.

790
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,689
Stay with me.

791
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,180
Okay?

792
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:43,340
We have got to go to the river. The river.

793
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:48,140
- Jack? Get across the border.
- Okay. Okay, we're going to keep going.

794
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:49,260
- Ready?
- Ready.

795
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,420
Okay? Okay.

796
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:57,485
- The river, right? Okay, stay with me, okay?
- Okay, come on. Okay? Okay. Come on.

797
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,844
My feet are...

798
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:21,885
There's the river.

799
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,291
Go ahead.

800
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,691
<i>What?</i>

801
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:08,860
Get in there, go.

802
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:10,486
Go, go, go.

803
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:18,520
What do we do? Stay there. I am going to go
down to the river, and I am going to get a boat.

804
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:21,381
Okay, just wait right here.
Okay.

805
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,850
Boat?

806
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,220
I will give you... give you the watch.
Watch for the boat.

807
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:09,700
Here look, look... Gold watch, here.
Look, look, look. For the boat.

808
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:11,201
A thousand dollars.

809
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,244
- Shoe...
- You want the shoes?

810
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,540
Shoe.

811
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:21,941
Look.....

812
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,488
<i>Okay, hold on.</i>

813
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,041
Okay.

814
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,165
Hold on.

815
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:01,645
Okay?

816
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,780
Okay.

817
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,380
What?

818
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:10,209
Where?

819
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:06,389
Okay, we're fine here for a second.

820
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,321
<i>Mommy.</i>

821
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:32,496
<i>Daddy...</i>

822
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:37,996
- Daddy! Lucy!
- Lucy! Lucy... Lu....

823
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,260
Dad, look out!

824
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:45,889
Hey!

825
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:51,300
- Daddy!
- No! No!

826
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:56,442
Let her go! Let her go!

827
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:11,526
No! No! Please! She's just a kid, stop!
Please! Please! Just let her go! Please! Please!

828
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,310
No!

829
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:16,310
No....

830
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:21,447
- No! No!
- No! No!

831
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:27,527
No! No!
Please! Please! Stop!

832
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:32,060
Lucy! Lucy!
Just do it! Just do it!

833
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,450
Lucy, I am right here, I am right here.

834
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:50,660
We're together! I love you!
Daddy!

835
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:56,361
- It's okay. Do it.
- No, Daddy! We need you.

836
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,361
<i>We need you.</i>

837
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,250
<i>No....</i>

838
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:04,350
<i>No....</i>

839
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:37,041
Where's the Beeze?
I will go get her.

840
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:40,647
I am sorry, Daddy!

841
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:44,820
You did great!
It's okay, it's all right.

842
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:51,165
- It's okay. It's okay.
- All right. Mommy.

843
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:58,286
<i>- All right.
- Okay.</i>

844
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,521
Come here.

845
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,820
Shit!

846
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:55,684
They're going to see us, Jack!

847
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,090
Get down, get down.

848
01:31:59,090 --> 01:32:00,820
Get down and stay quiet.

849
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:10,847
Vietnam, there's Vietnam.

850
01:32:10,847 --> 01:32:12,086
Keep rowing.

851
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:20,880
Come on!

852
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:34,060
Stop! Do not continue!

853
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:37,209
You do not have permission
to enter Vietnam!

854
01:32:37,209 --> 01:32:38,940
Turn your boat around!

855
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:40,700
Stop! Do not shoot!

856
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:43,260
Do not shoot!

857
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:45,860
You do not have permission
to enter Vietnam!

858
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:48,725
We're seeking asylum!
We're just a family!

859
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,700
We need help!

860
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:52,802
Stop! Do not continue!

861
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,420
You do not have permission to enter Vietnam!
Don't shoot! Do not shoot!

862
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:59,097
We're bringing my family into Vietnam!

863
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:02,220
Do not proceed any further.

864
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:03,980
- Do not shoot!
- Turn your boat around.

865
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:07,220
We're not turning around. Do not shoot!

866
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:08,731
Don't shoot!

867
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,100
Lower your weapon.

868
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:15,180
This boat is now in Vietnamese waters.

869
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:18,460
If you shoot,
we will consider this an act of war!

870
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:22,167
This boat is now in Vietnam!
Lower your weapon!

871
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:50,169
Okay, it's over.

872
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,001
Okay.

873
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:24,204
Daddy, will you tell me
the story about how I was born?

874
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:27,521
Okay.

875
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:35,220
Well, I thought it would be a good idea
to videotape your mom giving birth.

876
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:37,846
I was saying,
"Push harder, push harder,"

877
01:35:37,846 --> 01:35:43,500
and she gave me a look, like...
You know that look Mommy gives, like...

878
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,648
"You're in big trouble."

879
01:35:45,648 --> 01:35:47,420
And then I came out?

880
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:50,180
Then you came out, yep.

881
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:51,700
And then they spanked me?

882
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:55,540
Well, they spank all little babies
because they're trying to get them to cry.

883
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:58,900
- But she didn't?
- She wasn't crying.

884
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:02,780
So they spanked you again.
And they spanked her again.

885
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:05,100
Then they tried again.

886
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:07,762
- But I wasn't breathing.
- That's right.

887
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:13,768
Then more doctors came rushing in,
and they brought in more machines and...

888
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:18,008
The nurse said, "You might want
to turn that video camera off."

889
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:25,420
And then your Dad looked at me and said,

890
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:26,940
"You need to talk to her.

891
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:30,540
You need to tell her to breathe
because she knows your voice."

892
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:32,100
"Loud."

893
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:35,140
- "Say it to her."
- So I started yelling,

894
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:36,900
"Breathe, Lucy.

895
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:39,765
"Breathe, little Lucy, please."

896
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,780
And then I did?

897
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:44,991
- Yeah.
- And then you did.

898
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,740
Then I brought you over to Mommy,

899
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:49,060
and she held you
for the first time, and I said,

900
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:51,811
"Don't worry little Lucy, you're okay.

901
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:53,971
We're going to keep you safe."

902
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:07,690
Don't be sad, Daddy.

903
01:37:07,690 --> 01:37:09,370
I am not sad.

904
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,808
I am happy.

905
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,403
Really happy.
