00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:00,783
Shining.
Shining.

3
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,980
Shining,
come back here.

4
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Come back here

5
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,610
Daddy!

6
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:11,990
Daddy! ... Daddy! ... Daddy!

7
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,870
Get in here.
- Fuck, you.

8
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:18,566
Jeez... baby Jesus!

9
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,208
It's coming down out there the like a
shit load of bricks.

10
00:03:20,258 --> 00:03:21,800
Come on you guys,
were you born in a barn?

11
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,700
Oh, nice one, Hawkins.
- Blow it out your your ass, Gulloy.

12
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,400
That is very inappropriate language.

13
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,530
Hey, don't make me shove those fucking
scissors where the sun don't shine.

14
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,270
Also, very inappropriate language.
- All right, Calm down, Gulloy.

15
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,540
You! Leave him alone.
It's going to be a long night.

16
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,580
Merry Christmas.

17
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,569
Jesus, Gulloy, crank the fucking heat down,

18
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:44,980
it's like Christmas in Auschwitz in here
for fucks sakes.

19
00:03:57,092 --> 00:03:59,608
Why'd we wait til the end of the
year to finish this crap?

20
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:01,993
Because we're lazy.

21
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,047
Hey!

22
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:08,086
Speak for yourself.

23
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:10,873
Come on, Jeannie.
- Hooo! ...

24
00:04:12,984 --> 00:04:14,777
Careful there, Jeannie.

25
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:19,167
Robin Hood here is notorious for putting
an arrow through a young maiden's heart.

26
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:21,971
Well, trust me, I'm pretty
good at dodging arrows.

27
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:26,658
Uh, oh, was that an
uncomfortable silence?

28
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,963
Yeah.

29
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:34,126
Speaking of silence, what's with the
cell phones not working tonight?

30
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:36,434
Hey, you guys got reception?
- No, not for hours.

31
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:39,629
Fucking storm.
- Okay, get out of my desk.

32
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,719
Fuck you.

00:04:54,606 --> 00:05:00,223

To save the message press 2.

To replay the message press 1.

35
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,070
Alex, ... I need some time
to think, okay?

36
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,572
I just need some time.

37
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:21,848
Since Mary passed away,
its never been the same.

38
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,276
I'm taking the kids to my
parents for the holidays.

39
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,766
End of message

40
00:05:28,043 --> 00:05:30,366
For the best daddy in the world.

41
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,583
Shining.

42
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,199
Shining.

43
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,467
Mary.

44
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,918
Can I help you?

45
00:07:21,582 --> 00:07:23,582
Uh ...

46
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,610
Yes, I'd like to make a confession.

47
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:33,967
Confession?
- I'm here to make a confession.

48
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:37,218
Confess to what?

49
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,107
Murder.

50
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:18,024
Somebody, get over here,
I need some help.

51
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:19,965
I'll get it.

52
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,637
Gulloy. Jesus.

53
00:08:26,627 --> 00:08:28,785
What the fuck is the problem?
- Get over here!

54
00:08:28,723 --> 00:08:31,688
Watch, whoa, hey.
What's going on?

55
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:34,579
Who are you?

56
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,921
Huh, I thought Dick Tracy
went home for the night?

57
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:48,848
Aren't the kids
waiting up for you?

58
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:52,792
No, they're at the in-laws, tonight.
I'm going to join them in the morning.

59
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:57,678
Ooh.

60
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:01,778
Dead man's hand. - Bad luck, looks
like you're not going home tonight.

61
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:05,958
Graveyard shift could use a little
company. Yeah, just like old times Black.

62
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:08,152
I'm gonna go check on Hawkins.

63
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,159
Excuse me.

64
00:09:18,402 --> 00:09:21,651
What's happening here, Gulloy?
Get over here.

65
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:25,075
What in the hell's going on here?
- This guy said he killed somebody.

66
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:26,689
All right, just let's
take it easy, Gulloy.

67
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,098
Gulloy, put that gun down.
You, hands on your head!

68
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,915
Who are you?

69
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:36,239
Hands on your head.

70
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,864
I said, put the gun down!
- He hasn't put his hands on his head!

71
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:41,100
Gulloy, put Goddamn gun down.

72
00:09:41,103 --> 00:09:43,069
Hey, hey, hey!
What is this?

73
00:09:43,003 --> 00:09:46,000
Gulloy says this guy walked in
here and said he killed somebody.

74
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,838
Gulloy, put that gun down before I
shove it down your throat.

75
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,517
You. Put your hands on your head.

76
00:10:06,534 --> 00:10:08,734
I said put your hands above your head.

77
00:10:20,305 --> 00:10:23,096
Okay. Tough guy.

78
00:10:23,976 --> 00:10:26,111
Take him to the interrogation room.

79
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,998
Watch him.

80
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,607
What were you gonna do?
Shoot him?

81
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:43,569
No, just ...

82
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,982
Just go back to sharpening
your pencils

83
00:10:45,032 --> 00:10:46,480
and leave the gun play for
the grownups, will ya.

84
00:10:52,274 --> 00:10:54,316
Ah, what brings the local storm
troopers in tonight.

85
00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:55,731
How's it hanging, boys?

86
00:10:57,293 --> 00:11:00,508
Fratelli, what's up? - We got a
bad accident on the interstate.

87
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:03,078
It's going to take most of the night
to clear it up. So, we're

88
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:06,956
diverting traffic and we're
going to close the off ramp.

89
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,621
You guys are going to have
quiet night around here.

90
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,245
- It's already pretty quiet
with the holidays.

91
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:14,112
I thought you'd be home
wrapping presents.

92
00:11:16,785 --> 00:11:17,779
Yeah.

93
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:21,637
Well, you and your merry men,
have a good night.

94
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:24,259
You guys, keep warm.

95
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,166
So, who'd ya kill?

96
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:01,863
What!?

97
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,411
He's gaslighting you,
let it go.

98
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,238
Hey, I don't like the way
you're eyeballing me.

99
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:10,600
Come on, Jack.

100
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,878
Everything is in the eyes ...

101
00:12:18,258 --> 00:12:22,262
your eyes ... are full of fear.

102
00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:27,247
You think I'm afraid of you?
- You're afraid of everybody.

103
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:30,989
Right back to the schoolyard.

104
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:35,026
That's were you hid first,
right, bully.

105
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:41,778
Afraid of what ... all the children
will say behind your back.

106
00:12:42,064 --> 00:12:43,903
Right, bully?
- Shut the fuck up!

107
00:12:44,284 --> 00:12:46,610
Come on, Jack,
don't let this guy

108
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,272
push your buttons with
some dimestore psychology.

109
00:12:52,008 --> 00:12:54,454
Fuck you!
- Hey, hey!

110
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:56,581
Are we okay in here?

111
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,561
Okay.
- Hawkins?

112
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:06,035
Yeah.

113
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:10,738
All right, name?

114
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:17,984
I said name?

115
00:13:21,358 --> 00:13:23,175
What's your Goddamn name?

116
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:25,966
Noboby ...

117
00:13:28,846 --> 00:13:30,552
That doesn't exactly help me.

118
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,455
All rights.
Nobody, huh.

119
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:48,221
All right, have it your way.

120
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,133
Mr Nobody. Who exactly do you
claim to have murdered?

121
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:53,635
Or, am I missing something here?

122
00:13:53,636 --> 00:13:55,105
Yes, you are.

123
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,706
Are you going to confess something,
or is this just a stunt?

124
00:13:58,553 --> 00:14:01,152
I could charge you with making
a false statement, if you prefer.

125
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:03,403
Detective ...

126
00:14:04,835 --> 00:14:08,727
...be careful what you wish for.
You may get it.

127
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:14,539
What I can assure you, that before
the evening is out

128
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,504
You will know I'm telling the truth,
that I have committed murder.

129
00:14:25,837 --> 00:14:27,805
Well, let's just stick with the basics.
Get his prints.

130
00:14:28,248 --> 00:14:29,504
Let's see ...

131
00:14:30,123 --> 00:14:32,483
If Mr Nobody here is in the system.
- Pleasure.

132
00:14:33,265 --> 00:14:35,644
Detective, I like that pen,
especially the inscription:

133
00:14:35,694 --> 00:14:38,645
'To the best Daddy
in the world.'

134
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:41,129
By the way ...
I murdered six people.

135
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:51,726
"To the best daddy in the world."

136
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,146
Come on, Jeannie.

137
00:15:12,124 --> 00:15:14,654
Why do bachelors always
make such terrible coffee?

138
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:17,412
Because they don't have women to show
them how to do it the right way.

139
00:15:17,413 --> 00:15:19,954
You know in a round about way,
that's pretty damn insulting.

140
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:23,340
You know what they say
about mistletoe?

141
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,120
Yeah, some cultures consider being
kissed under the mistletoe

142
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,506
to be the 'Kiss of Death'

143
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:30,224
Yeah, well, that's just superstition.

144
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:34,596
In some cultures, being kissed under the
mistletoe, is the 'Kiss of Love.'

145
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,005
Well, there's no mistletoe
here, anyway.

146
00:15:44,384 --> 00:15:45,724
Voilà!

147
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:51,296
What if somebody sees us?
- It's mistletoe. It's the law.

148
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,301
Yeah.
- Yeah.

149
00:16:10,664 --> 00:16:11,665
What's the matter?

150
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:18,702
I thought I saw that guy.
I thought I saw him standing right there.

151
00:16:20,235 --> 00:16:22,769
Hawkins and Pine took
him to processing.

152
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:29,199
Hey, there's nobody here.

153
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:34,174
You okay?
- Yeah ... too much caffeine.

154
00:16:34,854 --> 00:16:38,063
I'm going to cut down. I ...
I'm going to check something.

155
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:58,306
Okay. Face front.

156
00:17:12,012 --> 00:17:13,708
Something wrong, deputy?

157
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:15,745
Are you done?

158
00:17:17,155 --> 00:17:18,836
Jack ... are you done?

159
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:23,308
Yeah, I'm done.
- Okay, right index finger.

160
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:33,902
Left.

161
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:43,983
Give me your other hand.
What?

162
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:48,234
This guy's got no prints.

163
00:17:49,562 --> 00:17:50,916
Well, how the hell can that be?

164
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:53,818
I do not know.
I'm going to tell Black.

165
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:55,422
Lock him up.

166
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,668
Gulloy, get in here!

167
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,856
Do me a favor, lock him up, okay?

168
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:04,472
Come on. I got to get up on some bulbs.
They all burned out. What are they ...

169
00:18:04,473 --> 00:18:06,093
Just do it, all right?

170
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,990
All right, come on.

171
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:15,553
Gosh, darn it.
- All the the

172
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:20,033
bulbs burning out at the
same time. Odds are against it.

173
00:18:20,688 --> 00:18:22,733
Yeah.
- What do you make of it?

174
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:24,851
I do not know.

175
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,443
Perhaps, it's a warning.
- A warning?

176
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,375
About ... about what?

177
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:18,340
Did you forget something?

178
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:31,601
No prints. - Yeah, I'm telling
you, the guy's got no fingerprints.

179
00:19:32,043 --> 00:19:35,413
You can burn prints off with acid.
- Yeah, but it's not permanent.

180
00:19:35,936 --> 00:19:39,110
The pattern goes down several layers of
the skin, but it always grows back.

181
00:19:40,452 --> 00:19:43,092
Yeah, and it would have left some scaring.
- Maybe he cut them off.

182
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,295
The skin grows back along
with the prints.

183
00:19:45,778 --> 00:19:47,666
Yeah, skin's got growth memory.

184
00:19:47,928 --> 00:19:49,712
No shit.
Yeah?

185
00:19:49,747 --> 00:19:52,613
Somebody out there loves cops, makes
sure we always find the bad guys.

186
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:55,251
All right, so what do you want us
do with this guy?

187
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:58,772
Aah ...

188
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:02,184
Look, I'll go over him again in a
minute. I have to make a phone call first.

189
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:26,458
Hey, Jack, you all right?

190
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:30,008
You feeling what I'm feeling?
What?

191
00:20:30,692 --> 00:20:34,448
That stranger, Mr Nobody,
gives me the creeps.

192
00:20:34,871 --> 00:20:37,826
Black's starting to make me nervous, too,
if you know what I mean. - Yeah, right.

193
00:20:38,618 --> 00:20:41,783
There's something about this prisoner.
I ... I don't know.

194
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,507
I Can't put my finger on it, but ...

195
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:53,058
I can't fucking work like this.

196
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:55,173
Bulbs are burning out
in here, too, Gulloy.

197
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:57,119
You're just going to have to live
with it. We're all out of bulbs.

198
00:20:57,248 --> 00:20:59,128
There are none in the storage
locker downstairs?

199
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,409
They've all been smashed.
What?

200
00:21:03,457 --> 00:21:07,527
How did that happen?
- I ... I don't know ...

201
00:21:11,534 --> 00:21:15,056
I'm going to go finish processing
Mr. Nobody. - Mr Nobody?

202
00:21:15,561 --> 00:21:17,743
Yeah, he wouldn't give us his name.

203
00:21:18,107 --> 00:21:20,440
So, is he the real deal?
- I don't know.

204
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:22,363
Black hasn't broken him yet.

205
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,838
We don't want go through that
with Black, again. - No, we don't.

206
00:21:25,411 --> 00:21:28,134
Anyway, this time of year there's always
a lot of lonely people

207
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:31,492
that false alarms so they can have
somebody to spend Christmas with.

208
00:21:31,543 --> 00:21:33,137
That's so sad.
Yeah?

209
00:21:34,053 --> 00:21:37,895
I got a funny feeling this guy
ain't in no holiday spirit.

210
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:40,044
Who are you?

211
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:44,423
Nobody.

212
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:57,606
Are you okay, deputy?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

213
00:23:07,657 --> 00:23:08,967
What is it?

214
00:23:10,037 --> 00:23:12,589
What is that? ...
That tune.

215
00:23:14,251 --> 00:23:16,241
The Lacrimosa.

216
00:23:17,734 --> 00:23:21,140
Mozart's Requiem, the death mass.

217
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:25,638
Some say it was commissioned
by a messenger from beyond

218
00:23:26,334 --> 00:23:27,614
for his funeral.

219
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:31,916
What do you think? Do you think
there's any truth to that?

220
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:02,975
Yes.

221
00:24:03,812 --> 00:24:05,740
Yes, I know.

222
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,595
Could you please ...
just ...

223
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,047
Look I miss Mary too, you know.

224
00:24:18,534 --> 00:24:20,510
Very much.

225
00:24:24,222 --> 00:24:27,571
Could you please just put the kids
on the phone? Could you do that?

226
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:35,800
Hey! Hi, guys, how you doing?

227
00:24:38,313 --> 00:24:41,710
Well, uh, Daddy's got some
work to do tonight. So ...

228
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:50,208
Yes, I will be there for Christmas.
I promise.

229
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:56,109
You're my best friend.
Daddy look at Shining.

230
00:24:57,525 --> 00:24:59,133
Daddy? ... Daddy? ...

231
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,756
Daddy?

232
00:25:02,727 --> 00:25:07,780
Daddy?
Shining, Shining!

233
00:25:08,547 --> 00:25:11,160
Shining, come back here.
Come back.

234
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:13,185
I love you guys, too.

235
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:20,628
Goodbye.

236
00:25:43,606 --> 00:25:45,439
Go get our friend.

237
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:50,929
You sure? He could cool his heels
until after the holiday.

238
00:25:51,564 --> 00:25:55,396
No, go get him. I need
somebody to work over.

239
00:25:57,267 --> 00:25:59,015
All right.

240
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:10,358
Hey, Black wants us to
bring the prisoner up.

241
00:26:10,785 --> 00:26:12,033
I need a smoke.

242
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:14,823
What the fuck?

243
00:26:15,818 --> 00:26:17,157
I'll give you a hand.

244
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:20,671
Okay, has anybody
seen my scissors?

245
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:23,020
Gulloy, what cell did you put that guy in?
- Cell four.

246
00:26:23,021 --> 00:26:24,677
Let's go.

247
00:26:36,747 --> 00:26:38,438
Oh, fuck.

248
00:26:46,495 --> 00:26:48,787
One of us must have got the fuse box.

249
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:53,351
Jesus Christ. Fuck.
Gulloy said cell number 4.

250
00:26:54,005 --> 00:26:55,997
Were you looking for me?

251
00:26:58,315 --> 00:27:00,512
Fuck, Gulloy can at least count.

252
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:15,270
Hey, ...
Is that my deck of cards?

253
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,821
Where'd you get those?

254
00:27:20,173 --> 00:27:22,717
I said where'd you
fucking get those?

255
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,142
Move it, dipshit.

256
00:27:52,342 --> 00:27:54,495
You tell me all right? -Please.
This is your last chance.

257
00:27:54,912 --> 00:27:57,119
Is she alive?
Where is my little girl?

258
00:27:57,207 --> 00:27:59,942
You're gonna start talking.
- No, I do not know any little girl.

259
00:28:00,003 --> 00:28:03,079
You can't do this.
- Whip him, whip him.

260
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,756
Hit him, hit him, one more, again.
- Where is his daughter?

261
00:28:07,236 --> 00:28:09,241
You know where his daughter is, or
I cut your fucking tongue out.

262
00:28:09,242 --> 00:28:13,664
I'm innocent, I'm innocent...
I'm innocent.

263
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:22,585
Hawkins come back yet?
- No, I haven't seen him.

264
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:25,599
All right, do me a favor, Jeannie,
help Sherwood with Houdini here, okay.

265
00:28:25,843 --> 00:28:27,091
Sure.
- Thanks.

266
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,785
Hey, what crawled up you rusty ass
and fucking died?

267
00:28:39,835 --> 00:28:41,859
Did that guy look familiar to you?

268
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:43,456
Who? Our Mr. Nodbody?

269
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:46,742
He looks like that drifter.
- What drifter?

270
00:28:47,878 --> 00:28:49,744
The drifter Black made us beat the shit
out of, that's who.

271
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,659
Come on, Jack, that's
not possible.

272
00:28:51,836 --> 00:28:53,674
You better not let Black hear
you talk like that.

273
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:57,107
I'm telling you, Jerry, I looked in
his fucking eyes, all right. It's him.

274
00:28:57,699 --> 00:29:01,031
Now, you listen to me.
That was a bad situation.

275
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,479
We were all stressed. That's it.
You need to let it go.

276
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,378
You know what's strange?
- What?

277
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,656
It was all of use who were
here that night ...

278
00:29:08,562 --> 00:29:10,266
That's all of us who
are here tonight.

279
00:29:11,192 --> 00:29:14,450
Me, you, Sherwood, Jeannie and
Gulloy and fucking Black.

280
00:29:15,364 --> 00:29:17,244
Some coincidence, huh?

281
00:29:18,168 --> 00:29:21,002
Come on pal, let's get back inside,
it's fucking pissing out.

282
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:25,870
Come on.

283
00:29:27,852 --> 00:29:29,991
I'll buy you a couple Christmas
drinks after work, all right?

284
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:33,748
It's about time.
- Fuck you.

285
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,616
You feel like talking yet?

286
00:29:46,694 --> 00:29:51,158
Red dress, blue hair, long legs.

287
00:29:52,908 --> 00:29:54,946
Winking at me.

288
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,809
Who's that. The victim?

289
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:01,096
You talk too much.

290
00:30:01,824 --> 00:30:03,729
When was the last time you
ever paid for anything, huh?

291
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:08,153
What are you doing?

292
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:12,401
I'm going to go check on something.
- All right, I'll see you in a bit.

293
00:30:18,704 --> 00:30:22,240
I stalked ... the victim.

294
00:32:05,182 --> 00:32:06,322
I waited ...

295
00:32:07,702 --> 00:32:09,089
Gulloy!

296
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,339
You better not be fucking
around, Gulloy!

297
00:32:14,734 --> 00:32:16,916
I waited for the fear to set in.

298
00:32:16,951 --> 00:32:18,125
Gulloy!

299
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:22,108
I'm in no fucking mood.

300
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:30,988
What's with the lights?

301
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:33,729
It was dark.

302
00:32:39,788 --> 00:32:41,975
Then I attacked.

303
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,037
I'm innocent.

304
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,879
Gulloy!
- I am innocent.

305
00:32:54,075 --> 00:32:56,804
Let me out, damn, let me out.

306
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:59,919
Gulloy!
- I am innocent.

307
00:33:04,244 --> 00:33:06,204
Help

308
00:33:07,374 --> 00:33:09,360
You can't do this. I'm innocent.
- Whip him!

309
00:33:09,943 --> 00:33:11,256
Do it, hit him!

310
00:33:12,936 --> 00:33:14,367
Hit him!

311
00:33:15,052 --> 00:33:16,430
Hit him!

312
00:33:21,824 --> 00:33:24,456
Help me!

313
00:33:38,055 --> 00:33:40,174
Where was I?

314
00:33:43,156 --> 00:33:44,544
What the fuck?

315
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:48,128
Dream.

316
00:33:49,502 --> 00:33:51,104
Watch him.

317
00:34:01,002 --> 00:34:02,766
Fucking, make him talk!

318
00:34:03,036 --> 00:34:05,060
Tell me where his daughter is, or
I cut your fucking tongue out.

319
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,692
I'm innocent.

320
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:14,391
Jesus! Talk, or I cut your tongue out!

321
00:34:30,554 --> 00:34:33,079
He does not scream no more.

322
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:52,892
Hey, Pine, did you hear that?
- Yeah, I fucking heard that.

323
00:34:53,076 --> 00:34:54,663
Definitely came from downstairs.

324
00:35:01,376 --> 00:35:02,725
Oh my God.

325
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:05,108
Jesus.

326
00:35:06,889 --> 00:35:10,749
Red dress, blue hair, long legs

327
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:13,630
winking at me.

328
00:35:21,304 --> 00:35:23,944
Come on,
let's go, let's go.

329
00:35:26,128 --> 00:35:28,207
Let's go, Gulloy!

330
00:35:28,433 --> 00:35:30,364
Come on, Pine, come on.
- What ...?

331
00:35:41,752 --> 00:35:43,246
Jesus, Black.

332
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:47,411
Black

333
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,485
What's happening?

334
00:35:50,863 --> 00:35:52,559
Black

335
00:35:55,348 --> 00:35:57,178
How did you do that?

336
00:36:01,156 --> 00:36:04,596
Get both hands flat on the table.
Do it!

337
00:36:05,005 --> 00:36:06,701
What the fuck is going on, Black?

338
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:17,863
Cuff him, cuff him. Do it!

339
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:28,355
Both hands. Just do it!

340
00:36:43,703 --> 00:36:46,190
So quickly to violence.

341
00:36:47,021 --> 00:36:50,057
All right. Let's go.

342
00:36:51,246 --> 00:36:52,933
What about him?

343
00:36:53,716 --> 00:36:55,249
Just leave him.

344
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:58,611
Let's go.

345
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,031
Lock it.
- What for, both his hands were cuffed.

346
00:37:06,734 --> 00:37:08,469
No arguments, do it.

347
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,308
Are you going to tell us what
the hell's going on here, Black?

348
00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:15,595
Hawkins is dead.
What?

349
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,793
Oh my God.

350
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,967
We searched downstairs, the entire
first floor ... nothing.

351
00:37:23,932 --> 00:37:26,123
Okay, how about about outside?
- We're on our way.

352
00:37:26,064 --> 00:37:28,940
Listen, M ...M ... Maybe we should
call for help.

353
00:37:29,322 --> 00:37:33,554
Help? We're the Goddamned
police, Gulloy. GO!

354
00:37:33,649 --> 00:37:36,076
Go cover Pine's back,
get out of here!

355
00:37:37,914 --> 00:37:39,849
All right, you go that way,
check the perimeter.

356
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,535
Listen, M ... m ... maybe it's
better if we don't split up.

357
00:37:44,725 --> 00:37:46,909
Come on. Fuck it.

358
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:13,979
Get it off.

359
00:38:14,623 --> 00:38:17,235
Get it off!
Get it off!

360
00:38:42,744 --> 00:38:44,977
What is it?
- Where the fuck did that come from?

361
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,958
It fucking came from the roof.

362
00:38:49,345 --> 00:38:51,465
What the fuck ... what is it?

363
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:04,703
Fucking tag says, Shining.
That was Mary Black's cat.

364
00:39:06,004 --> 00:39:09,296
We need to go up to the roof.
- No, man, no, I'm not going up there.

365
00:39:09,121 --> 00:39:11,705
The fucking roof, get up.
Let's go to the fucking roof.

366
00:39:18,676 --> 00:39:21,092
Did you find anything?
- We're checking the roof.

367
00:39:21,422 --> 00:39:23,588
Jesus, Gulloy, what happened?
- You tell him.

368
00:39:24,386 --> 00:39:26,269
We found a cat.
- A cat?

369
00:39:26,845 --> 00:39:28,161
A dead cat.

370
00:39:28,211 --> 00:39:32,573
The, the collar, the, the tag said
it belonged to ... Mary.

371
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:36,033
That can't be.

372
00:39:40,205 --> 00:39:42,683
Can somebody just please tell
me what the hell is going on?

373
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:49,645
There's something I should to tell you.
- What?

374
00:39:51,924 --> 00:39:54,521
Hawkins was acting all weird,
before he ...

375
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:57,316
What, Pine?
- Well, he just ...

376
00:39:58,619 --> 00:39:59,883
He just thought that ...

377
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:03,992
Mr Nobody reminded him of ...

378
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,069
...the drifter.

379
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,022
Goddamn it.

380
00:40:21,057 --> 00:40:22,242
Get him in there!

381
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,043
Watch the door, Gulloy!
Get him in there! Get him in there!

382
00:40:27,577 --> 00:40:30,434
Hit him! Turn him around,
turn him around.

383
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:34,232
Where is she? Hit him again.

384
00:40:34,267 --> 00:40:38,085
Get him up, get him up.
- Where is she? - Innocent!

385
00:40:38,198 --> 00:40:40,617
He's got my little girl.
- You sure? - Yes!

386
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,635
Come on, start talking!
- I am innocent.

387
00:40:43,636 --> 00:40:47,263
Come on. Come on. Look, Black,
maybe she just ran away.

388
00:40:47,298 --> 00:40:48,723
If she's alive, we'll find her.

389
00:40:49,382 --> 00:40:51,870
This is the guy.
I swear, this is the guy.

390
00:40:52,389 --> 00:40:53,867
Look, you can't do this.

391
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,801
...suck it up? You, want to go upstairs?
- No,I'm good. - Good.

392
00:40:56,852 --> 00:40:59,312
I'm innocent, I'm innocent.
- Where is she?

393
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:03,923
I swear to God,
you tell me where she is.

394
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:06,701
You heard him!
Where is she?

395
00:41:06,702 --> 00:41:10,397
Look I know that you were spotted in
the same place she was last seen.

396
00:41:10,398 --> 00:41:12,333
Where is she?
- I am innocent.

397
00:41:12,334 --> 00:41:15,321
Just tell me ... is she alive.
Just tell me is she alive.

398
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:18,929
All right, this is your last chance, man.
Just tell me is she still alive?

399
00:41:21,001 --> 00:41:22,585
Hey, look up, my friend,
look up, huh.

400
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:29,503
String him up! String him up!
- Come on, Black.

401
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,870
String him up!

402
00:41:31,353 --> 00:41:34,681
Come on, do it. Do it!
- Put it on, Gulloy.

403
00:41:35,363 --> 00:41:37,471
All right.
That's it ...

404
00:41:37,852 --> 00:41:39,956
I'm innocent.
- String him up.

405
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:43,889
Where is she?
Where is she?

406
00:41:46,015 --> 00:41:47,431
Hit him.

407
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:51,387
Again, ... again.

408
00:41:52,062 --> 00:41:54,225
I'll fucking make him talk.
- Where is she?

409
00:41:54,536 --> 00:41:56,460
Look at me.
- Hawkins, come on.

410
00:41:56,466 --> 00:41:58,875
Tell me where his daughter is or
I'll cut your fucking tongue out.

411
00:41:59,528 --> 00:42:04,195
Talk, or I'll cut your tongue out.
Where is his daughter?

412
00:42:04,196 --> 00:42:09,295
Where is his fucking daughter?
- Whip him, whip him.

413
00:42:10,035 --> 00:42:12,046
Do it! Hit him!
Hit him!

414
00:42:13,439 --> 00:42:15,663
Hit him!
- Where is his fucking daughter?

415
00:42:15,664 --> 00:42:17,195
Where is she?

416
00:42:18,922 --> 00:42:21,164
Jeannie, put it on his head.
Put it on his head.

417
00:42:21,165 --> 00:42:24,775
I'm innocent.
- Put it on, tight. Tight.

418
00:42:26,203 --> 00:42:27,979
Eye for an eye,
tooth for a tooth ...

419
00:42:29,387 --> 00:42:31,321
More.

420
00:42:32,818 --> 00:42:36,137
Again. Where is she?

421
00:42:37,836 --> 00:42:40,591
You know stranger,
I can do whatever I want.

422
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:42,882
You know why?
Because you're a nobody.

423
00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:47,324
And that little girl, she's my flesh
and blood. Do you understand?

424
00:42:48,038 --> 00:42:51,342
I'm innocent.
- Everyone ... get out!

425
00:43:03,452 --> 00:43:04,901
Please.

426
00:43:06,021 --> 00:43:09,999
You can't do this. I'm innocent.
- See this? - I'm innocent.

427
00:43:10,685 --> 00:43:13,045
My little girl gave me this pen.

428
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,530
Gulloy, I never meant
for it to go that far.

429
00:43:52,793 --> 00:43:54,367
I was just trying to
save my daughter.

430
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:58,571
Now, shut up, Gulloy, there was a good
chance that she was still alive.

431
00:43:58,572 --> 00:43:59,997
Yeah, but she wasn't!

432
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:03,567
Because she was already
fucking dead.

433
00:44:04,299 --> 00:44:07,246
The State Police shot and killed the
guilty fucker who did it.

434
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:10,607
They even found little Mary's
locket on his person.

435
00:44:10,544 --> 00:44:13,667
We know what happened, Gulloy! A
Goddamn history lesson isn't needed!

436
00:44:13,668 --> 00:44:17,950
That drifter was innocent.
God, you fucking asshole!

437
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,488
Gulloy.

438
00:44:29,324 --> 00:44:33,166
Put it down.
Please.

439
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,165
You snivelling fat fuck.

440
00:44:40,996 --> 00:44:42,381
I may not be much ...

441
00:44:43,637 --> 00:44:45,272
but all I got to do
is pull the trigger.

442
00:44:45,273 --> 00:44:46,725
That's enough!

443
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:49,691
We all knew what was on the
line that night, right?!

444
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:53,501
I'm positive.
All of us.

445
00:44:55,196 --> 00:44:57,468
We were all guilty for what
happened that night.

446
00:44:57,415 --> 00:44:58,334
If you didn't like it,
you could have stopped it,

447
00:44:58,384 --> 00:44:59,960
but you didn't.

448
00:44:59,961 --> 00:45:01,743
Did you?

449
00:45:05,939 --> 00:45:07,019
He ...

450
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:10,594
he's still in a coma, you know.
- How do you know that?

451
00:45:11,746 --> 00:45:14,324
I checked up on him.
He's in Crestdale.

452
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:15,512
You, what?

453
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,346
Look, you might be able to
live with it, but I ...

454
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,602
...I, I can't live with the lies.

455
00:45:27,066 --> 00:45:29,192
It was you, Black.

456
00:45:31,785 --> 00:45:35,274
It was you who made all of
us swear to that story.

457
00:45:37,194 --> 00:45:41,674
You made us swear that he attacked us
and we were forced to defend ourselves.

458
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:47,810
Jesus, who have we got locked away?

459
00:46:09,076 --> 00:46:11,980
Pine ... Gulloy, you go
check out the roof.

460
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:14,492
You two come with me.

461
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:17,523
We're going to check our Mr. Nobody.

462
00:46:23,476 --> 00:46:25,032
All right.

463
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:27,324
Let's move out.

464
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,958
Black
- Is he in there?

465
00:47:09,782 --> 00:47:11,685
Open it.

466
00:47:37,822 --> 00:47:40,126
What the fuck was that?
What?

467
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:44,534
Stay here! - What?
Just fucking stay here.

468
00:47:45,342 --> 00:47:46,960
Pine!

469
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:55,076
Time to start talking, pal.

470
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,208
My second victim was ...

471
00:48:05,248 --> 00:48:06,992
- Need.

472
00:48:07,752 --> 00:48:10,534
He was a coward.

473
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:20,222
I came up behind him.

474
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,507
Why are you doing this?

475
00:48:26,508 --> 00:48:30,203
He who does nothing
still faces consequences.

476
00:48:39,102 --> 00:48:42,473
Watch the door, Gulloy!
- What the hell's going on here?

477
00:48:42,474 --> 00:48:45,274
Look, you can't do this.
- Hey, Gulloy, I want you to suck it up!

478
00:48:45,275 --> 00:48:47,930
I'm innocent.

479
00:48:50,715 --> 00:48:52,169
Who are you?

480
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,540
Gulloy!

481
00:48:58,652 --> 00:49:01,076
Gulloy, where the fuck are you?

482
00:49:09,252 --> 00:49:13,281
String him up! String him up!
- Come on, Black!

483
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:20,142
String him up!
Do it! Do it!

484
00:49:20,143 --> 00:49:21,996
Get that noose on him!

485
00:49:24,204 --> 00:49:29,336
Come on! - I'm innocent!
Don't do this ... Please!

486
00:49:31,288 --> 00:49:35,916
So, with a length of rope ...
I strangled him.

487
00:49:36,996 --> 00:49:40,060
I hung him out to dry.

488
00:49:47,692 --> 00:49:50,643
Fuck!
Oh, Christ.

489
00:50:07,907 --> 00:50:10,920
Pine! Pine!
What happened?

490
00:50:10,921 --> 00:50:12,928
I do not know, we only split
up for a second, man. Fuck me.

491
00:50:12,929 --> 00:50:16,174
Somebody had to be up there.
- I tell you, there's nobody up there.

492
00:50:16,175 --> 00:50:17,555
There wasn't anybody?
- Nobody!

493
00:50:19,036 --> 00:50:20,548
Fuck it. Nobody.

494
00:50:21,232 --> 00:50:24,241
Fuck.
- Come on.

495
00:50:24,673 --> 00:50:27,604
Through all this, it makes me
wonder if God really exists.

496
00:50:28,748 --> 00:50:31,235
Baby, don't fill your head
with all that freaking shit.

497
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,788
Hey, I want that son of
a bitch locked up.

498
00:50:39,644 --> 00:50:42,500
Now! I mean it!
Let's go!

499
00:50:43,162 --> 00:50:44,987
Goddamn.

500
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,711
Jesus Christ

501
00:50:56,566 --> 00:50:59,430
Let he who is without sin
cast the first stone.

502
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,886
You better shut your pie hole.

503
00:51:02,774 --> 00:51:07,192
It's ironic, isn't it? The Old
Testament had a rathful God, but ...

504
00:51:07,936 --> 00:51:11,232
...people became uneasy with the
concept, needed a bestseller.

505
00:51:11,233 --> 00:51:14,003
So they came up with the New Testament.

506
00:51:14,558 --> 00:51:17,606
Suddenly, God was loving
and forgiving.

507
00:51:20,055 --> 00:51:22,595
I'm old school, myself.

508
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:26,342
I prefer the Old Testament.

509
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:32,910
I mean, you got to love a God who's not
afraid to meet out a little vengeance

510
00:51:32,911 --> 00:51:35,094
when the need arises.

511
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:38,442
Get him out of here.

512
00:52:24,425 --> 00:52:28,097
Does the name Mary Black,
mean anything to you?

513
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:31,480
She was a little girl who
was murdered last year.

514
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:33,001
She was my daughter.

515
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,418
We arrested a drifter.

516
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:38,962
We ran his fingerprints,
but they weren't in the system.

517
00:52:40,475 --> 00:52:42,999
Oh, so he was a Nobody.

518
00:52:45,024 --> 00:52:46,360
Yeah.

519
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:49,810
Lock him up.

520
00:53:08,851 --> 00:53:10,676
Get in there.

521
00:53:30,253 --> 00:53:31,814
The drifter's in a coma, right?

522
00:53:31,815 --> 00:53:35,062
I mean, he's been locked up the whole time,
so how can he kill Hawkins and Gulloy?

523
00:53:35,063 --> 00:53:37,991
Then this guy walks in here with
his Prince of Darkness routine

524
00:53:37,992 --> 00:53:39,840
and has an accomplice knock us
off one by one ...

525
00:53:40,728 --> 00:53:42,979
I don't think the one has
anything to do with the other.

526
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,108
What do you say, Black?

527
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,923
I don't know.

528
00:53:52,371 --> 00:53:54,173
That's it!

529
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,055
What?

530
00:54:01,316 --> 00:54:02,284
Pine, what is it?

531
00:54:02,285 --> 00:54:04,103
Gulloy said he checked up on the drifter
on a regular basis.

532
00:54:04,153 --> 00:54:05,003
Said he was at ... a ...
Crestdale.

533
00:54:05,004 --> 00:54:06,399
- Crestdale.
- Yeah. Crestdale.

534
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,790
Let's see if he came
out of his coma recently.

535
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:11,858
Yeah, yeah, maybe he's on the loose.
- Wouldn't that be nice.

536
00:54:12,544 --> 00:54:14,578
Crestdale Care Centre,
409 Beatty Street, New York.

537
00:54:24,994 --> 00:54:28,050
Yes, hello, this is deputy Pine.
I'm inquiring about one of your patients.

538
00:54:28,051 --> 00:54:30,618
One of our deputies checked
up on a regular basis.

539
00:54:31,482 --> 00:54:33,331
Yes, that'll be deputy Gulloy.

540
00:54:34,267 --> 00:54:35,577
That's right, the "John Doe."

541
00:54:38,729 --> 00:54:40,496
He died earlier this evening?

542
00:54:42,353 --> 00:54:45,320
You wouldn't happen to know the
exact time of death would you?

543
00:54:47,353 --> 00:54:48,929
Thank you.

544
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:53,193
The drifter died at 8:14 p.m.

545
00:54:57,672 --> 00:55:00,336
8:14 Stranger enters. Held for questioning.

546
00:55:03,021 --> 00:55:05,108
Gulloy has recorded here
in his log ...

547
00:55:05,946 --> 00:55:09,877
that Mr. Nobody walked through
that door at 8:14 p.m.

548
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:13,274
All right ... all right.
Uh ...

549
00:55:15,701 --> 00:55:17,204
Look, we need to call
in some help.

550
00:55:17,205 --> 00:55:20,348
Call, uh, Douglas. Get Sheriff McArthur
on the line. - It's Christmas Eve.

551
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:22,669
I don't give a damn!
We got two dead deputies!

552
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:25,311
It's dead. - What?
- We were just fucking using it!

553
00:55:25,312 --> 00:55:28,390
It's fucking dead!
- Maybe it's the rain. Just keep trying.

554
00:55:29,986 --> 00:55:32,277
It's dead.
- They're all dead.

555
00:55:33,052 --> 00:55:35,000
Hey, look, I saw some lights when
I was up on the roof.

556
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:36,864
Maybe it was the state
troopers from before.

557
00:55:36,865 --> 00:55:38,598
Yeah, that's right, they closed
the off ramp for the town.

558
00:55:38,648 --> 00:55:40,513
...that accident on the highway.

559
00:55:41,322 --> 00:55:44,165
Pine and I can go up there.
Use the radio. Call for some back up.

560
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:46,556
That's a good idea. Do it.
- I'll go with you.

561
00:55:46,557 --> 00:55:48,086
You don't have to do.
- I want to.

562
00:55:51,007 --> 00:55:52,926
I guess we just wait, huh?

563
00:55:56,574 --> 00:55:58,169
Pine ...
Yeah?

564
00:55:59,505 --> 00:56:01,504
...between you and me ...

565
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,485
who do you think we got
locked up down there?

566
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:09,165
I'm a fucking blank.

567
00:56:10,157 --> 00:56:12,373
Part of me doesn't want to know.

568
00:56:38,037 --> 00:56:40,561
This fucking weather out there?

569
00:56:53,236 --> 00:56:55,979
Black, where are you going?
- I need you to know who the stranger is.

570
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,752
Why?
- You know why.

571
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,111
There they are.

572
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:24,706
I don't see anybody.
- Turn on your brights.

573
00:58:00,802 --> 00:58:04,146
Okay, where the fuck are they?
- Over here.

574
00:58:07,947 --> 00:58:09,919
I'm waiting for you.

575
00:58:10,655 --> 00:58:13,475
What is that, Goddamn ventriloquist?
- I'm over here.

576
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:14,855
Help me.

577
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,670
And we're the dummies.
Yeah?

578
00:58:18,592 --> 00:58:20,411
Oh, shit.
- All right.

579
00:58:25,342 --> 00:58:28,397
Slow down.
- I waiting for you.

580
00:58:35,236 --> 00:58:36,715
It was this one.

581
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:39,427
Look!
- I'm over here.

582
00:58:39,428 --> 00:58:40,752
Fuck.

583
00:58:54,961 --> 00:58:56,961
All right.

584
00:58:58,448 --> 00:59:02,987
This ... a drifter, you mentioned.
Did he have a name?

585
00:59:05,883 --> 00:59:09,508
No.
Why is that?

586
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:15,147
He wouldn't give it to us.
- He wouldn't give it to you ...

587
00:59:15,148 --> 00:59:18,397
What happened to him?

588
00:59:21,412 --> 00:59:25,204
It was an accident.
- There was an accident ...

589
00:59:32,292 --> 00:59:35,717
Well, I'm ready to continue
with my confession.

590
00:59:37,131 --> 00:59:40,045
My next victim was a married man ...

591
00:59:41,021 --> 00:59:44,373
Get Sherwood and Jeannie on the radio
and get them over here, ASAP! GO!

592
01:00:01,501 --> 01:00:03,433
Hey, where are you guys!

593
01:00:07,093 --> 01:00:08,936
Jeannie, Sherwood, come in.

594
01:00:11,164 --> 01:00:13,864
Jeannie, Sherwood, come in, over!

595
01:00:16,037 --> 01:00:19,290
Did you hear that?
I'll check it out.

596
01:00:23,859 --> 01:00:28,340
Jeannie, Sherwood, come in, over.
- Mary is found, you got that?

597
01:00:29,638 --> 01:00:31,135
Pine?

598
01:00:32,783 --> 01:00:36,173
This is Pine, come in, over.
- Pine, is that you?

599
01:00:38,789 --> 01:00:42,128
Stop it.
- I was hiding ...

600
01:00:42,936 --> 01:00:45,400
...in the shadows.

601
01:00:54,825 --> 01:01:00,148
I found Mary Black's body.
She's cut up, dead. It's awful.

602
01:01:01,015 --> 01:01:03,422
Oh God, who's going to tell Black.

603
01:01:04,076 --> 01:01:06,475
Who is this? - It's awful.
- Identify yourself.

604
01:01:06,476 --> 01:01:09,275
She's cut up, dead.
- Who is this!

605
01:01:39,254 --> 01:01:42,375
Pine, Sherwood, come in, over!
- Mary is found, you got that?

606
01:01:43,173 --> 01:01:45,643
Sherwood, do you hear me?
Sherwood!

607
01:01:54,011 --> 01:01:55,887
Goddamn it.

608
01:01:56,775 --> 01:02:01,780
You persecuted the poor and protected
the rich. - Shut up. Shut up!

609
01:02:08,077 --> 01:02:10,494
Fuck ... Fuck.
Fuck!

610
01:02:12,835 --> 01:02:13,923
Guys?

611
01:02:15,715 --> 01:02:17,587
Guys?!

612
01:02:23,346 --> 01:02:26,402
This is your last chance.
- I was behind him.

613
01:02:27,355 --> 01:02:29,472
He didn't see me.

614
01:02:36,957 --> 01:02:39,581
Black! Black, what the
fuck are you doing?

615
01:02:40,396 --> 01:02:43,571
No! No! Pine, you don't understand!
- What are you doing?

616
01:02:43,572 --> 01:02:45,508
You do not understand.

617
01:02:49,736 --> 01:02:53,935
Come on, play with me, motherfuckers!
You want to play? Come on!

618
01:03:01,773 --> 01:03:03,532
Show yourself!

619
01:03:08,057 --> 01:03:09,498
Show yourself.

620
01:03:09,499 --> 01:03:13,460
Wait, where is he?
Relax, there's nothing.

621
01:03:17,062 --> 01:03:20,912
Look, there's nothing.
There's nothing, nothing there.

622
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:25,740
Nothing.

623
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:31,867
...and then I attacked!

624
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:36,679
Fuck.
What the fuck?

625
01:03:38,269 --> 01:03:40,269
Fuck.

626
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:51,588
Sherwood?

627
01:03:52,892 --> 01:03:54,869
Sherwood!

628
01:03:56,045 --> 01:04:00,370
Come on. Come on.
Jesus Christ. Fucker.

629
01:04:07,287 --> 01:04:09,287
NO!

630
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,728
Okay, Sherwood. Hit him!
Hit him!

631
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:14,669
I said, hit him!
Jesus.

632
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:17,710
No?

633
01:04:18,027 --> 01:04:20,515
No! No!

634
01:04:33,046 --> 01:04:34,651
Sherwood!

635
01:04:36,899 --> 01:04:38,563
Sherwood!

636
01:04:42,101 --> 01:04:43,837
Sherwood, where are you?

637
01:04:45,324 --> 01:04:48,428
Of all my merry men's Robin

638
01:04:48,429 --> 01:04:51,813
to run in Sherwood Forest free.

639
01:04:51,814 --> 01:04:58,216
Strife will soon befall them all,
leaving them dead and not married.

640
01:05:05,005 --> 01:05:06,372
Again!

641
01:05:18,045 --> 01:05:19,755
Again!
Again!

642
01:05:40,779 --> 01:05:42,218
Sherwood!

643
01:05:43,834 --> 01:05:45,866
Please, answer me!

644
01:05:48,699 --> 01:05:50,299
Sherwood!

645
01:05:52,526 --> 01:05:54,594
Sherwood!

646
01:06:03,331 --> 01:06:05,016
Sherwood!

647
01:06:12,614 --> 01:06:14,614
Sherwood!

648
01:06:23,102 --> 01:06:25,102
Aaaah!

649
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:27,625
Aaaah!

650
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:19,423
Goddamn it, Black. You mind
telling me what you were

651
01:07:19,473 --> 01:07:21,065
trying to accomplish down there?

652
01:07:21,953 --> 01:07:23,680
Black, what are you doing?

653
01:07:37,529 --> 01:07:39,384
Jesus Christ.

654
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:46,228
Jeannie!

655
01:07:47,644 --> 01:07:50,644
He's dead.

656
01:07:50,645 --> 01:07:53,885
He's dead.
- Who? Sherwood?

657
01:07:54,517 --> 01:07:58,368
Jeannie, look at me! Look at me!
Tell me what happened.

658
01:07:59,248 --> 01:08:03,268
We found the troopers cruiser.
It was empty. Nobody there.

659
01:08:03,269 --> 01:08:07,524
I heard the radio and left him.

660
01:08:08,005 --> 01:08:10,499
I'm sorry, honey.
- What's happening?

661
01:08:12,007 --> 01:08:13,652
I don't the fuck know.

662
01:08:14,268 --> 01:08:16,376
Mr. Nobody.

663
01:08:18,384 --> 01:08:21,984
His confessions. Every time he
confesses it comes true.

664
01:08:21,985 --> 01:08:26,423
What, the fuck, are you talking about?
- He's killing us with his confessions.

665
01:08:27,387 --> 01:08:29,331
Jesus Christ.

666
01:08:32,539 --> 01:08:34,539
Look.

667
01:08:35,095 --> 01:08:37,695
Why did executioners where hoods?
- Huh?

668
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:44,302
Why firing squads only load one gun,
and leave the rest blank?

669
01:08:44,674 --> 01:08:48,184
I mean, why, why did three
guys throw the switch for

670
01:08:48,233 --> 01:08:51,457
the electric chair, and only
one of them had juice?

671
01:08:51,458 --> 01:08:53,999
So nobody had to live with the guilt?

672
01:08:55,023 --> 01:08:58,326
No, it's superstition.

673
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:02,594
In England ...

674
01:09:03,835 --> 01:09:06,762
the executioners who were
working the guillotine

675
01:09:07,414 --> 01:09:11,037
even though their faces were
shrouded in a black cloth

676
01:09:11,038 --> 01:09:15,868
they would run home. Barricade
themselves behind the door, and hide.

677
01:09:16,597 --> 01:09:19,461
They were hiding from their victims.

678
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:22,258
Why?

679
01:09:23,306 --> 01:09:26,303
Because they believed that
the victims, the condemned,

680
01:09:27,047 --> 01:09:30,358
would come back as vengeful spirits and
hunt them in the middle of the night.

681
01:09:32,022 --> 01:09:37,166
Even though they covered their faces,
their identities.

682
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:42,082
That was how they felt they got their
strength. By being nobody.

683
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:47,034
It gave them freedom from repraisal.
- And the drifter, he's one of them?

684
01:09:47,699 --> 01:09:53,058
Yeah. He's using his cloak of anonymity.
To hunt us from the shadows.

685
01:09:53,059 --> 01:09:56,082
And he's come back to pay us back
for what we did to him.

686
01:09:56,083 --> 01:09:57,789
And we let him walk right through
that fucking door.

687
01:09:57,839 --> 01:09:59,189
But we didn't execute him.

688
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:01,530
Oh, didn't we. Deny it.

689
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:05,370
You got us into this. You get us out.
- Hey, I was trying to save my daughter.

690
01:10:05,371 --> 01:10:09,122
All right, that's enough!
Enough. Then, what do we do?

691
01:10:11,338 --> 01:10:13,218
What do we do?

692
01:10:15,222 --> 01:10:17,343
Hell, when I was in Desert Storm

693
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:21,112
we were hit, I tell you we
were hit hard, right.

694
01:10:21,162 --> 01:10:23,286
Don't believe all that shit
about Saddam's guys just giving up

695
01:10:24,017 --> 01:10:25,963
All right, we were close
to being overrun ...

696
01:10:26,651 --> 01:10:29,005
But our CO, he told us ...

697
01:10:29,828 --> 01:10:33,701
that there was no shame in retreating,
when the decks were stacked against you.

698
01:10:34,333 --> 01:10:35,936
So, I tell you what...

699
01:10:37,088 --> 01:10:39,123
we live to fight another
day, all right?

700
01:10:40,211 --> 01:10:43,660
I think I'll move back that fucking
squad car, all right. Let's go.

701
01:10:44,292 --> 01:10:46,124
Let's go!

702
01:10:49,692 --> 01:10:51,998
Go ahead, push it out.

703
01:10:52,694 --> 01:10:54,726
Back it up, Jeannie.

704
01:11:03,413 --> 01:11:05,413
Fuck.
- What the ...

705
01:11:05,513 --> 01:11:07,557
What am I doing wrong?
- Pop the hood.

706
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:13,753
Okay. Try it again,

707
01:11:17,858 --> 01:11:20,758
Turn it over, Jeannie.
- Come on!

708
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:25,156
It don't work.
- Fuck!

709
01:11:26,012 --> 01:11:28,030
Ready to hear my confession?

710
01:11:28,854 --> 01:11:30,507
It's awful.
Ha, ha, ha ...

711
01:11:31,666 --> 01:11:33,507
Coming.

712
01:11:35,514 --> 01:11:39,114
All right, Jeannie, hold on! - Jeannie!
- The fucking door's locked.

713
01:11:39,115 --> 01:11:41,402
Open the door, Jeannie.

714
01:11:43,547 --> 01:11:46,443
She had long golden hair, blue eyes.

715
01:11:46,444 --> 01:11:48,573
I couldn't wait to suffocate her.

716
01:11:48,574 --> 01:11:51,473
Jeannie, open the door.

717
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:52,304
I don't know

718
01:11:52,354 --> 01:11:55,464
All right, this is your last chance, man.
You just tell me, is she alive?

719
01:11:55,465 --> 01:11:58,875
Listen, I'm innocent.
- No, I'm good!

720
01:11:59,797 --> 01:12:01,594
Jeannie, put it on his head!

721
01:12:01,595 --> 01:12:03,206
Put it on his head.

722
01:12:03,207 --> 01:12:06,483
Ass wipe, tell me where she is.
I don't know

723
01:12:07,262 --> 01:12:10,549
I know it, you were spotted in the

724
01:12:10,599 --> 01:12:13,319
same place she was last seen.
Where is she!

725
01:12:16,354 --> 01:12:18,485
Go back, Jeannie.

726
01:12:23,237 --> 01:12:26,516
You're about to take a high seat
among the Devils of the Dark.

727
01:12:43,797 --> 01:12:45,797
Jeanie, get down!

728
01:13:09,817 --> 01:13:13,044
Poor girl, the powers of darkness
have claimed you for their own.

729
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,336
Come on, motherfucker.
- Christ.

730
01:13:24,129 --> 01:13:28,098
You know what, stranger. I can do
what ever I want and you know why?

731
01:13:28,099 --> 01:13:30,664
Because you're a nobody!

732
01:13:39,104 --> 01:13:44,156
No solid pavement beneath your feet.
No kind neighbors to cheer you on.

733
01:13:44,157 --> 01:13:46,639
Jeannie, get down!

734
01:14:14,486 --> 01:14:16,262
Jeannie!

735
01:14:28,823 --> 01:14:32,180
You are now between the gallows
and the lunatic asylum.

736
01:14:32,817 --> 01:14:36,665
On the way to the silence.
Utter silence.

737
01:14:44,144 --> 01:14:46,768
Jeannie!

738
01:14:58,084 --> 01:14:59,571
No warning voice ...

739
01:14:59,572 --> 01:15:01,947
...no whispering your fate.

740
01:15:04,786 --> 01:15:07,922
You are being assaulted by
the powers of darkness.

741
01:15:21,095 --> 01:15:24,936
The rage from the back of nowhere,
has come to bury you in death.

742
01:15:56,668 --> 01:15:59,305
Poor girl. She lost her head.

743
01:16:09,054 --> 01:16:10,051
Pine ...

744
01:16:10,543 --> 01:16:11,679
Pine!

745
01:16:18,165 --> 01:16:19,791
Pine, what do you think you're doing?

746
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,957
You, shut up! They're dead.
They're all dead.

747
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:25,264
I'm going to get this son of a bitch!
- Pine!

748
01:16:26,286 --> 01:16:28,286
Fuck.

749
01:16:29,799 --> 01:16:31,670
Were you looking for me?

750
01:17:13,026 --> 01:17:15,380
Time for another confession.

751
01:17:22,161 --> 01:17:24,159
Can't hide in the dark.

752
01:17:26,626 --> 01:17:29,442
The shadows.
Watch the shadows.

753
01:17:31,303 --> 01:17:34,102
The next victim didn't
see it coming.

754
01:17:35,134 --> 01:17:38,356
Dead man's hand.

755
01:17:43,877 --> 01:17:45,536
Pine!

756
01:17:46,233 --> 01:17:50,385
What the heck is going on, man?
Hit him! Hit him!

757
01:17:54,084 --> 01:17:56,827
Turn around!
Where is she?

758
01:17:56,828 --> 01:17:59,814
Get him up! Get him up!
- Where is she?

759
01:18:00,590 --> 01:18:02,590
Shit.

760
01:18:10,458 --> 01:18:12,764
Hey, Look up.
Look up. Huh.

761
01:18:30,133 --> 01:18:32,856
Don't do this.
- String him up!

762
01:18:39,065 --> 01:18:42,082
Put it on! - An eye for eye,
tooth for a tooth.

763
01:18:43,158 --> 01:18:46,566
One more!

764
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:53,138
I can't see anything.
- I have that eye now.

765
01:18:58,779 --> 01:19:02,906
An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.

766
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:08,470
Are you ready to hear my
final confession, Detective?

767
01:20:19,542 --> 01:20:22,736
Let he who is without sin,
cast the first stone.

768
01:20:25,072 --> 01:20:27,874
Stay away from me.
You stay away!

769
01:20:43,298 --> 01:20:46,350
You can't escape.
All roads lead to me.

770
01:21:04,753 --> 01:21:06,682
Leave me alone!

771
01:21:07,274 --> 01:21:09,170
You can't hide in the dark.

772
01:21:48,986 --> 01:21:50,681
I told you.

773
01:21:53,169 --> 01:21:55,753
All roads lead to me tonight.

774
01:21:57,348 --> 01:22:00,875
Where it all started and
where it all ends.

775
01:22:03,122 --> 01:22:05,047
Confession time.

776
01:22:07,471 --> 01:22:09,631
I confess!

777
01:22:10,001 --> 01:22:13,451
I confess that I wronged you.
I confess, all right?

778
01:22:15,379 --> 01:22:18,218
I confess that I wronged an
innocent man, all right.

779
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:22,110
I have another
confession to make.

780
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:27,801
I wasn't innocent.

781
01:22:36,091 --> 01:22:37,612
You did it?

782
01:22:40,177 --> 01:22:41,857
Yes.

783
01:23:17,029 --> 01:23:19,360
Hey, little girl.

784
01:23:21,037 --> 01:23:22,355
No?

785
01:23:25,569 --> 01:23:27,038
You did it?

786
01:23:29,567 --> 01:23:32,040
Hey, little girl, good jumping.

787
01:23:32,881 --> 01:23:34,816
Hi.
- Hi.

788
01:23:34,817 --> 01:23:36,748
You have a beautiful cat.
No?

789
01:23:36,749 --> 01:23:40,175
Her name is Shining.
- Shining, that's a nice name.

790
01:23:40,176 --> 01:23:44,528
I have a cat, you want to see it?
- I've got to get home.

791
01:24:18,956 --> 01:24:20,093
Daddy!

792
01:24:20,893 --> 01:24:24,548
Daddy!

793
01:24:32,088 --> 01:24:33,989
The state troopers ...

794
01:24:34,577 --> 01:24:36,604
they shot to kill him.

795
01:24:37,391 --> 01:24:40,822
They found her locket?
- I tossed the locket.

796
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:45,879
Some poor bastard probably
picked it up.

797
01:24:46,055 --> 01:24:48,301
Some ... drifter ...

798
01:24:49,277 --> 01:24:51,031
some ... stranger.

799
01:24:54,296 --> 01:24:57,712
So, you were guilty.
- Afraid so.

800
01:24:58,936 --> 01:25:02,814
You swore you were innocent.
- What did you expect?

801
01:25:03,862 --> 01:25:06,253
Why?

802
01:25:07,053 --> 01:25:10,632
Why are you killing us?
- Revenge.

803
01:25:11,601 --> 01:25:17,216
I laid in that coma for a year and
all I dreamed about was vengeance.

804
01:25:18,072 --> 01:25:23,649
Do you have any idea how powerful a
dream can be if you can't escape from it.

805
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:26,394
It takes on a life of its own.

806
01:25:35,131 --> 01:25:37,755
You son of a bitch.

807
01:25:37,756 --> 01:25:42,931
My last victim was
Detective Alexander Black.

808
01:25:42,932 --> 01:25:45,953
He was a righteous man.

809
01:25:46,197 --> 01:25:50,023
Loved his kids.
They'll miss him.

810
01:25:54,799 --> 01:26:00,093
See this? My little girl
gave me a pen.

811
01:26:19,042 --> 01:26:20,538
I'm sorry.

812
01:26:21,154 --> 01:26:24,755
I'm not going to be able
to hear your condfession.

813
01:26:28,006 --> 01:26:30,006
Aaah!

814
01:26:30,728 --> 01:26:32,728
Aaah!

815
01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:36,050
Detective Black, you're dead.

816
01:26:36,826 --> 01:26:39,715
Yours is an impenetrable darkness.

817
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:42,625
Aaah!

818
01:26:47,523 --> 01:26:50,470
I look at you as a man who is
lying at the bottom of a

819
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:53,169
precipice where the
sun never shines.

820
01:26:55,024 --> 01:26:58,449
There are not enough tears for
all the sorrow you have wrought.

821
01:26:59,005 --> 01:27:01,849
You are all numbered with the dead.

822
01:27:05,962 --> 01:27:10,186
It's strange how I have to accept
this unforeseen partnership, this ...

823
01:27:10,187 --> 01:27:13,871
choice of nightmares forced
upon me in this place.

824
01:27:14,164 --> 01:27:16,262
Invaded by these men.

825
01:27:17,375 --> 01:27:20,997
These mean and greedy phantoms,
filled with hate.

826
01:27:33,501 --> 01:27:35,858
What ... Who ... Why?

827
01:27:36,014 --> 01:27:39,673
I should have come earlier,
but I was afraid.

828
01:27:49,096 --> 01:27:53,199
I love you.
- I came to help you, Daddy.

829
01:27:54,534 --> 01:27:57,424
I can hear you.
I can hear you.

830
01:28:00,633 --> 01:28:04,475
He's a bad man.
- Yes, yes he is, honey.

831
01:28:04,476 --> 01:28:06,558
He scares me.
No?

832
01:28:07,878 --> 01:28:11,583
No, he can't hurt you anymore, honey.
He can't hurt you anymore.

833
01:28:12,727 --> 01:28:15,311
You're going to stop him, Daddy?

834
01:28:16,119 --> 01:28:19,316
I wish I could.
- You can.

835
01:28:26,987 --> 01:28:29,087
Just like the others.

836
01:28:38,759 --> 01:28:42,457
I walked through the valley of death
and became the Shadow of evil.

837
01:28:45,068 --> 01:28:46,484
How?

838
01:28:47,317 --> 01:28:49,168
How can I stop him?

839
01:28:50,728 --> 01:28:54,555
Please, honey. Please tell me
how can I stop him.

840
01:28:57,954 --> 01:29:02,537
He doesn't like his name.
He doesn't want people to know it.

841
01:29:02,538 --> 01:29:07,789
He hides. He hides in the shadows.
It's where he's strong.

842
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:10,439
Nobody makes him strong.

843
01:29:10,885 --> 01:29:12,885
Uh, huh.

844
01:29:14,363 --> 01:29:16,414
I know his name.

845
01:29:37,034 --> 01:29:38,106
Put ...

846
01:29:38,630 --> 01:29:39,527
that ...

847
01:29:40,135 --> 01:29:41,674
down.

848
01:29:41,675 --> 01:29:44,618
Well, well, well, look who
decided to come out and play.

849
01:29:50,835 --> 01:29:53,421
Stanley Harperton.

850
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:58,423
That is your name, isn't?
How?

851
01:29:58,425 --> 01:30:03,300
Stanley Harperton, child killer.
- Stop.

852
01:30:04,335 --> 01:30:06,200
Murderer.
- I can't.

853
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:09,270
Coward.
- Wait ...

854
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:13,070
Sorry, ... I can't hear you.

855
01:31:27,055 --> 01:31:30,485
Thank you, Daddy.
I love you.

856
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:34,200
I have to go now.

857
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,690
Mary ...

858
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:47,760
I love you, too, sweety.

859
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:50,890
Very much.
