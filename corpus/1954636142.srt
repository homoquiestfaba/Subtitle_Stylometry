1
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:40,874
<i>What a great morning.</i>

2
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:44,478
<i>The rising sun,
the tweeting of the Terradons.</i>

3
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:50,014
<i>Today is the perfect day to ask my boss
for that advance on my paycheck.</i>

4
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,652
<i>Wilma deserves a nice vacation.</i>

5
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:05,597
- What's the matter, Fred?
- I'm already late for work.

6
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,809
Hard work, dedication, a big hammer.

7
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:25,913
That's how you break rocks.
You listening to me, Mr. Cenastone?

8
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,882
Absolutely, Mr. Slate.
And please, call me John.

9
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,820
I prefer the formality of last names.

10
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,522
Just because you're my sister's
husband's nephew once removed,

11
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:39,426
- doesn't mean you get special privileges.
- No, sir. I'm here to work.

12
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:43,230
Good. Because laziness
is one thing I won't tolerate.

13
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,031
Also lateness. I hate that.

14
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,907
Come on, people. Some of us got jobs
we should have been at 20 minutes ago.

15
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:17,364
It's a livin'.

16
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,767
These prontocranes
are delicate pieces of equipment.

17
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,234
Takes a real expert to run one of these.

18
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,537
Hey, Flintstone!

19
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:27,305
Flintstone?

20
00:03:30,232 --> 00:03:31,286
Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.

21
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:35,179
Flintstone, you'd better
not be sleeping up there!

22
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:39,319
Flintstone!

23
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,090
Yes, Mr. Slate.
I was just adjusting the...

24
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,991
Well, get back to work!

25
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,928
Yes, sir. I will get back to it.

26
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:52,062
Work. Which is what I was
doing up here all this time.

27
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,745
Help me!

28
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,948
Hang on, Mr. Slate.
I'll have you down in a jiffy.

29
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,348
There's got to be
an off lever here somewhere.

30
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:19,760
That was the up lever. Oh, you think
I would have figured that out by now.

31
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,259
Now, let's see here.

32
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:28,432
My bad! Only one left. Got to be it.

33
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,858
Mr. Slate, you okay?

34
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,916
I'm kissing granite here, Flintstone.
Do I look okay?

35
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:47,888
Listen. This might not be the best time,
but since I have your attention,

36
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:53,059
I was wondering if I could get my paycheck
a little early this month?

37
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,463
I'd promised my wife I'd take
the family on a vacation.

38
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,965
- A vacation?
- To Rockapulco.

39
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,067
A vacation!

40
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:06,204
You almost got me killed
and you want to go on a vacation!

41
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:13,346
Well, after a day like today
I could use some R&R.

42
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,682
You probably could too.

43
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,215
Dinosaur!

44
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,573
You guys okay?

45
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,041
Wow, that was amazing.

46
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,044
You got some moves, kid.
What's your name?

47
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:47,948
- Me? I'm John. John Cenastone.
- Good to meet you, John.

48
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:51,051
- I'm Fred...
- Flintstone, in my office!

49
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,946
Now.

50
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,924
There you go.

51
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,129
Your paycheck.

52
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:07,131
Seriously? Wow!
Mr. Slate, that's awful generous.

53
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:12,069
I mean, after all that damage I caused,
I thought you'd be mad.

54
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,349
So, you are mad.

55
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:51,742
I'm just gonna go in there and tell Wilma
the vacation's off. She'll understand.

56
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:01,652
Wilma, I'm home!

57
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,627
Missed me that time.

58
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,137
Fred? Is that you?

59
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:21,775
Honey, listen. There's something I need
to tell you about our vacation.

60
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,243
There's something I need
to show you about our vacation.

61
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,821
Do you like it?

62
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,590
I got it for our trip.
60% off at Marshales.

63
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,626
What did you want to tell me
about the vacation?

64
00:07:40,174 --> 00:07:43,163
Just that...
I'm definitely not canceling it

65
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:46,497
because of something
that happened at work today.

66
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,766
Well, that's a relief.

67
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:56,007
I can't even remember the last time
we took a family vacation.

68
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,279
Oh, no. That's Barney and Betty.

69
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,482
We're supposed to go to the Water Buffalo
Charity Carnival together

70
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,285
and here I am
standing around in my bikini.

71
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,184
I have to get changed.

72
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,691
Tame your pterodactyls.
We'll be right out.

73
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:16,760
Why don't you honk it again?
I didn't hear it the first three times!

74
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:19,530
You hear it that time, Fred?

75
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:29,242
I can't believe you're actually
going on vacation.

76
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,112
And to Rockapulco.

77
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,316
I know! I feel like
the luckiest girl in the world.

78
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,283
I feel like a complete idiot.

79
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,653
Honk. Honk.

80
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,923
You should have seen her in that bikini.

81
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,826
I would have liked to have
seen her in that bikini.

82
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,547
Watch it, Rubble!

83
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,136
Hey, I got an idea, Fred.

84
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:53,900
Wait till you get back from vacation,
then tell her about the paycheck.

85
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,803
But, Barney,
we're not going on vacation.

86
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,338
Oh, don't tell her that, Fred.
It'll ruin your vacation.

87
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,385
Yeah!

88
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,578
You can jump in anytime.

89
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,147
Bamm! Bamm! Bamm!

90
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,602
Bamm!

91
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:45,718
- Whahoo, yeah!
- Oh, baby!

92
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,985
It's my turn!

93
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:54,427
Wow, Nikki and Brie Boulder.
So how much is a kiss?

94
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,229
100 clams.

95
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,666
100 clams? That sounds expensive.

96
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:03,269
Considering you get a kiss
from each of us, it's like half off.

97
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,205
In that case...

98
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,604
I'll take 502.

99
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,692
Fred Flintstone! Get out of that line!

100
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,259
- But it's for charity.
- Now.

101
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,637
Our charity booth is all set up, Fred.

102
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:41,508
I built the ring, put out the donation
bucket and tied on Hoppy's gloves.

103
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,476
Honk. Honk. Honk.

104
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,578
Anything else you need me to do?

105
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:50,250
- Yeah. Tell Wilma that the trip's off.
- Sure thing. Hey, Wilma...

106
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,504
- Pipe down, Barn.
- But you said...

107
00:10:52,604 --> 00:10:55,855
I'm never telling her
and you're not telling her either.

108
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,925
I'm going to find a way
out of this jam myself.

109
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,360
That's a great idea, Fred.

110
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,695
I haven't come up
with the idea yet, Barn.

111
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,365
But when you do,
it's gonna be a good one.

112
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:09,436
Step right up. Five clams
and get your five minutes in the ring.

113
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:13,373
Make it to the bell without Hoppy
knocking you block off and win a prize!

114
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:16,474
Who wants to take
some licks for charity?

115
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,447
Keep it above the pouch,
all right, buddy?

116
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,219
Honk. Honk. Honk.

117
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:30,907
Honk. Honk. Honk.

118
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,441
Honk. Honk. Honk.

119
00:11:40,632 --> 00:11:41,602
Next.

120
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,270
Honk!

121
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:46,306
Honk!

122
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,154
Honk!

123
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:51,238
Honk. Honk. Honk. Honk.

124
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:52,543
Honk. Honk. Honk.

125
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,383
I got this in the bag, Marble Henry.

126
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:01,487
I know you do, but seriously,
you can just call me Marble.

127
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,924
I prefer the formality of last names.

128
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,439
Honk!

129
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,498
I'm gonna win a prize.
No, no. I'm gonna win two prizes.

130
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:16,100
- Hey, thanks, man.
- They're both for me. Win your own prize.

131
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:26,513
- Have fun.
- You have fun.

132
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,146
I'm having a great time. Thanks.

133
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:36,688
Come on, you big, ugly jumping Dinorat.
It's takedown time!

134
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,827
Honk. Honk.

135
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,632
Hey, easy there, buddy.

136
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:54,374
He think he's gonna send me flying?

137
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,109
Think again.

138
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,978
I'm CM Punkrock!

139
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,315
And I got you a first class
ticket to my fist!

140
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:06,452
Listen. He's real sensitive. Maybe you
could cool down the pejoratives?

141
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:10,655
He's crying.
I made the Kangasaurus cry.

142
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:16,629
Hey, mister. He's a Hopparoo.
And you're being downright mean to him.

143
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,766
Oh, what are you going to do
about it, Shrimpo?

144
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,468
I was gonna ask you to be less mean.

145
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,602
"Less mean"? Like this?

146
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:33,513
Yo, check it out, Marble Henry.
He ain't so tough now, is he?

147
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,882
He sure ain't.

148
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:45,158
That's my beloved pet
you're humiliating out there.

149
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:49,629
I tried talking nice to you but now
I got to take matters into my own hands.

150
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:52,196
Oh, boy. Easy, Barn.

151
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:57,268
Aroo!

152
00:14:07,946 --> 00:14:09,682
Honk. Honk.

153
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:11,782
Honk?

154
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:18,558
Fred, little help here?

155
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,459
Looking good, buddy.
I think you got him.

156
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,438
- Is that...
- Barney!

157
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,179
That's right. I am CM Punkrock.

158
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,516
I am the best in the prehistoric world,

159
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,383
thanks to my straight-edge lifestyle...

160
00:14:55,026 --> 00:14:58,028
Oh, this raw fish business stinks!

161
00:15:05,203 --> 00:15:08,274
You okay, Barn?
I've never seen you that worked up.

162
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,742
I couldn't just stand there
and watch him tease Hoppy like that.

163
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,915
Hoppy, cut it out! That tickles.

164
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,451
- Best show I've ever seen.
- We should go again.

165
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,287
I'd pay 50 clams to watch
something like that again.

166
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,820
I would pay any price to see that.

167
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:27,594
That was a heck of a show, Flintstone.
Heck of a show.

168
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,396
Why, thanks, Mr. McMagma.

169
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:34,031
A fella could make a lot of clams
with a spectacle like that.

170
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:47,146
Barney Rubble, don't you ever do
anything dangerous like that again!

171
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,948
I don't plan on it, Betty.

172
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,619
Help me up, Marble Henry.

173
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:54,652
Ouch!

174
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,164
I'm coming to bed in a minute, Betty.

175
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,167
Just got to brush my teeth.

176
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:16,173
And for this I went to college?

177
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:19,912
Psst! Barney.

178
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:23,947
- You scared the paste out of me, Fred.
- I'm aware of that.

179
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:27,053
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't sleep.

180
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,589
I got this brilliant idea in my head.

181
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:33,025
We could put on another one of those
crazy matches like you did tonight

182
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,927
and charge folks to come and see it.

183
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,864
I promised Betty I wouldn't do
anything dangerous.

184
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:42,335
It ain't gonna be dangerous.
It'll be entertainment, like a show.

185
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:46,339
Wow. A show? I'd pay hard-earned clams
to see something like that.

186
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,910
That's what I'm telling you.
If we do this,

187
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,445
we can make enough clams
to take both our families on a vacation.

188
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:56,516
Betty sure would love a vacation.
What the heck. I'm in.

189
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,652
Barney, are you talking to someone?

190
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,285
Nope. Just gargling, sweetheart.

191
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,227
We just need to find
some more guys for the show.

192
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,061
And I think I know just where to...

193
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,664
start.

194
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:19,906
Yabba dabba doo!

195
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:24,477
Hey, Cenastone, you really showed
that dinosaur who's boss yesterday.

196
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,312
Oh, that? That was no big deal.

197
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:30,077
Are you kidding?
I tell you, if I had moves like that,

198
00:17:30,177 --> 00:17:33,185
I wouldn't be working in a quarry.

199
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:36,389
Actually, Mr. Flintstone, I don't plan
on breaking rocks my whole life.

200
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,753
None of us do, kid. None of us do.

201
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:55,708
- Maybe music is my thing.
- Music? With muscles like that?

202
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,111
Listen. Me and my pal Barney
are putting together

203
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:02,448
a little sports entertainment
event this weekend.

204
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:07,720
And you my dinosaur-throwing friend,
would be perfect for it.

205
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,124
- Me? You think?
- Oh, I don't think. I know.

206
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:16,095
Now if we could just find
a few more big strong fellas like you,

207
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,161
we'd have ourselves a show.

208
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,299
I might be able to help you out there.

209
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:46,175
Booyaka!

210
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:49,059
Yeah!

211
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,594
619!

212
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,827
Thanks.

213
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,934
No, thanks.

214
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,830
Daniel Bryrock, have a flyer.

215
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,019
No, thanks, Cenastone.
I don't want your flyer.

216
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,023
- Please, please. I insist.
- I said, "No, I don't".

217
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:55,795
- But I think you wanna say, yes, you do.
- No, I don't!

218
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,631
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't!

219
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,200
- Yes, you do!
- No, I don't!

220
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,367
- Yes, you do!
- No, I don't!

221
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:07,540
- No, you don't!
- Yes, I do!

222
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,176
- No, you don't!
- I say, yes, I do!

223
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:17,483
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

224
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,553
Yes! Yes! Yes!

225
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:24,421
- You think that guy's coming to the event?
- I'm gonna say, no.

226
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,773
- Hey, watch where you're going.
- Sorry about that.

227
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:33,666
You're that guy from the lodge. The one
who tag teamed me with that Dinohop.

228
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,599
Hopparoo. He's a Hopparoo.

229
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,972
Well, I think he's a dumbaroo.

230
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,708
And I didn't like getting
kicked out of the ring.

231
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:46,010
I didn't like it one bit.

232
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,916
And now I got you right where I want you

233
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:52,251
- and I'm going to give you...
- Ice cream!

234
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,955
Marble Henry!
We are not giving him ice cream.

235
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,624
We're giving him a beatdown.

236
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,257
Everything okay, Barn?

237
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,947
Everything's fine.
Just having a little chat.

238
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:08,868
As far as chats go,
that one was on the intimidating side.

239
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:12,053
You're ice cream's melting.

240
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:19,309
Come on, Marble Henry.
Let's get outta here.

241
00:21:23,414 --> 00:21:26,583
- You lick this one?
- I can't remember.

242
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,557
No, I licked the other one.

243
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,061
I get the feeling that guy
doesn't like me so much.

244
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,562
Don't sweat it, buddy.
We got bigger fish to fry.

245
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:48,171
Fred, dinner's almost ready.

246
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:56,112
Honey, didn't I tell you?
I'm playing poker with the boys tonight.

247
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,064
Hey, what's cookin'?

248
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,823
Smells delicious!
Sorry I'm missing it. Got to go!

249
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:08,227
Don't wait up!

250
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,163
- Fred?
- Yeah, Wilma?

251
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,264
- Fred?
- Wilma?

252
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,939
You're not going to try to double
our vacation fund

253
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,775
in some harebrained poker game, are you?

254
00:22:24,147 --> 00:22:25,877
What? No!

255
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:31,050
I am not gonna try to double our vacation
fund in some harebrained poker game.

256
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,218
That is a fact.

257
00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:38,988
There's nothing to
worry about, sweetheart.

258
00:22:39,088 --> 00:22:42,725
Your Freddy boy's
got it all under control.

259
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:04,116
When Freddy boy says don't worry,
I start worrying.

260
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:06,701
Yup.

261
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,558
We are good to go, Barn.

262
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:15,425
Wilma doesn't suspect a thing.

263
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:20,733
You're sure no one's gonna care
if we use the fairgrounds?

264
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:26,071
It's empty for the season. Besides we can't
just go back to the Water Buffalo Lodge.

265
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,107
People have been there, done that.

266
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:32,678
Trust me. This spot's the perfect venue
for tonight's scheme.

267
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,348
- You mean "event". Right, Fred?
- That's what I said.

268
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,783
Oh, sorry, Fred.
I could have sworn you said "scheme."

269
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:42,452
Focus. Barney.
I need you givin' 111% tonight.

270
00:23:56,634 --> 00:24:02,274
Look at that crowd, Barney.
Every one of them is worth 10 clams.

271
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:06,111
We've already got enough to take the wives
and kids on a week-long vacation.

272
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:09,882
Yeah, now all we have to do is make them
not want to ask for their clams back.

273
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:13,817
Don't worry, pal.
These guys are itching for action.

274
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,468
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

275
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:36,675
Sorry, Mr. Flintstone. I pulled
a double shift at the quarry today.

276
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:40,512
Come on, guys.
We got paying customers out there,

277
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:42,648
waiting for the show of their lives.

278
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:45,932
- This is no time for shell phones.
- Hey!

279
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,785
Or tablets.

280
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:52,722
I need you guys looking tough.

281
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,795
That's more like it!

282
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:00,697
What's with this suit, Mysteriopal?
You look ridiculous.

283
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,203
Hey, my sleeve!

284
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:06,818
Hey, my other sleeve!

285
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:12,209
Now we're getting somewhere. I just
need to do something about them slacks.

286
00:25:17,982 --> 00:25:20,462
How did you know I was wearing these?

287
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:24,354
I didn't.
Let's just consider this a lucky break.

288
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,962
These must have been
left over from the circus.

289
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,907
- Wait, Fred. Why do I need these?
- For your match.

290
00:25:41,047 --> 00:25:43,509
Whoa! No, no, no, Fred.
I promised Betty...

291
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:47,046
Like I said, this ain't dangerous.
It's an event.

292
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:50,015
- I don't know.
- Think about it, Barn.

293
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:54,186
Your beautiful family on the beach.
Not a care in the world.

294
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:58,657
The sound of lapping waves,
the smell of the crisp ocean air.

295
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:01,126
How can Betty get mad about that?

296
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:05,328
Barney, you're the best husband ever!

297
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:09,666
Bamm! Bamm! Bamm! Bamm!

298
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:13,733
- Okay, I'll do it.
- Attaboy!

299
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:17,443
Are these things supposed
to be this tight?

300
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:20,678
They're creeping up something terrible.

301
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,782
- I hope you know what you're doing.
- That makes two of us.

302
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,423
Ladies and gentlemen,

303
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:35,959
boys and girls,
are you ready for action?

304
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:42,801
We're about to make prehistory tonight.

305
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,571
Two will enter the ring
for the match of their lives.

306
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:48,605
But only one can be the champion.

307
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,466
It's caveman versus caveman

308
00:26:53,566 --> 00:26:57,723
in the ultimate sports spectacular!

309
00:26:59,717 --> 00:27:02,021
Flintstone might be onto something here.

310
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:05,857
John Cenastone...

311
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:12,795
Versus Rey Mysteriopal.

312
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:20,084
All right, guys. You know what to do.

313
00:27:20,184 --> 00:27:22,775
Mr. Flintstone,
we don't know what to do.

314
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:25,344
Get out there and put a hurt
on each other.

315
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,349
But we're friends.

316
00:27:27,578 --> 00:27:29,381
Work with me, Cenastone.

317
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,852
All you got to do is treat Mysteriopal
like that dinosaur the other day.

318
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,922
You toss him around a bit,
get the crowd excited.

319
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:41,330
- Give 'em a show!
- Oh, a show? Right, you got it.

320
00:28:17,907 --> 00:28:18,923
What?

321
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,400
Where are you going?

322
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,771
I tossed him around just like you said.
Sports entertainment is fun.

323
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,907
- But wait!
- One move and it's over?

324
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:33,309
- I want my clams back.
- This isn't good.

325
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,683
You got to win 'em back, Barney.

326
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:39,416
- But, Fred...
- But nothing.

327
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:47,826
That was just an appetizer, folks.
Now it's time for the main event.

328
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,927
Battling Barney Rubble...

329
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,398
Versus...

330
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:56,099
Hey, buddy, I just realized
I never caught your name.

331
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:01,370
The Undertaker.

332
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:06,442
Wow, that is some scary name.

333
00:29:10,144 --> 00:29:13,282
I don't know if I want
to do this anymore.

334
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,459
Barney, stop running! Get in there.

335
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,633
My ears hear you, Fred,
but my feet got a different idea.

336
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:42,078
Let me out of here!

337
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,528
- Barney, come down from there.
- No!

338
00:30:01,928 --> 00:30:04,737
- Get down!
- I don't wanna.

339
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:08,475
These people paid to see some action.

340
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,147
Which means you've
got to give 'em some action.

341
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:16,368
I like it up here.

342
00:30:16,468 --> 00:30:19,916
Sorry, buddy.
I got to do this, for the vacation.

343
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:33,363
- What happened?
- You pinned him, Barn. Just hold him there.

344
00:30:34,932 --> 00:30:37,035
One, two...

345
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:40,305
Barney Rubble,
what do you think you're doing?

346
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,193
Yikes!

347
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:49,348
One, two, three!

348
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:52,985
Barney, you come out
of that cage this instant!

349
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:55,767
I don't want to come out.
It's safer in here.

350
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,958
Fred Flintstone.

351
00:31:01,677 --> 00:31:04,396
- Hi, honey.
- Don't "Hi, honey" me.

352
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,875
You raise this cage right now!

353
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:09,941
Oh, boy!

354
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:18,710
You look beautiful tonight, Betty. Did you
do something different with your hair?

355
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,412
Not even a little.

356
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:25,317
You said you weren't going to try to double
our clams in some harebrained scheme.

357
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:28,687
Actually, I said I wasn't
going to try to double our clams

358
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:30,822
in some harebrained poker game.

359
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:36,962
I did, however, double our clams in a
harebrained sports entertainment event.

360
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:43,432
Now, we can all go on a real vacation
to Rockapulco together.

361
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:48,273
Is that true, Barney? This was all
so we could go on vacation together?

362
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:52,077
Sure was. Fred came up with the idea
after he destroyed the quarry,

363
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:55,745
nearly killed his boss
and had his paycheck taken away.

364
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,413
He what?

365
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,690
Now, honey, I know you're mad,

366
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,861
but I need you to keep
something in mind. Rockapulco.

367
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,197
Rockapulco,

368
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:15,598
Rockapulco, Rockapulco.

369
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:20,572
Okay, but you better not do this again.

370
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:24,943
Cross my heart, Wilma.
I got the vacation fund, I'm done.

371
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,942
Come on, Barney.

372
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:33,819
- That was amazing.
- Best show I've ever seen.

373
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,689
- Oh, wasn't it awesome?
- Man, I can't wait to watch the next one.

374
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,259
I'm going to buy a T-shirt.

375
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:45,127
Flintstone, you've got yourself
something real special here.

376
00:33:03,313 --> 00:33:06,759
Flintstone! Flintstone! Flintstone!

377
00:33:25,572 --> 00:33:29,538
<i>You've got yourself
something real special here.</i>

378
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:39,951
Flintstone!

379
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,053
You know my policy on laziness.

380
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,489
Mr. Slate, I'm sorry. I just...

381
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:48,190
One more slip up from you
and you're fired!

382
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,517
But, Mr. Slate...

383
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,137
You know what? I quit.

384
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:03,508
I don't need this job anyway.
I got something else going.

385
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:08,310
Something special,
something that's gonna make me rich.

386
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,121
What are you slow-clapping about?

387
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,020
Knock it off!

388
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:57,295
- You better get out of my way.
- I got a proposition for you.

389
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:01,266
I got a proposition for you.
Get outta our way.

390
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:04,302
That's totally not a proposition,
Marble Henry.

391
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:07,372
- Sorry, Punkrock.
- Continue, Flintstone.

392
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,474
How would you like
to get even with Barney?

393
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:10,976
The guy with the Kangarino?

394
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:14,145
It's a Hopparoo,
but, yeah, that's the fella.

395
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:19,147
- What? Like a rematch?
- Exactly like a rematch.

396
00:35:21,118 --> 00:35:23,655
By the way, it's tonight
at the Bedrock Arena.

397
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:26,415
The rematch on live television.

398
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:32,128
Call the Boulder twins.
Nikki and Brie are always up for fun.

399
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,583
Psst! Barney.

400
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,115
Geez, Fred, ever heard of a front door?

401
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:55,815
I did something, Barney. Something that's
gonna make us rich. Richer than rich.

402
00:35:55,915 --> 00:35:59,524
I should like the sound of that,
but for some reason I'm skeptical.

403
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:03,695
We didn't go big enough,
so we're gonna do another match tonight.

404
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:06,498
I signed a contract
with a television station.

405
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:10,368
I rented out the Bedrock Arena
and bought this fancy suit.

406
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,037
Where did you get the clams for that?

407
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:14,842
- I spent the vacation fund.
- You did what?

408
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:19,277
Barney? You've been in there a while.

409
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:22,063
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, not really.

410
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:26,242
- Fred, you got to get those clams back.
- Oh, forget it.

411
00:36:26,342 --> 00:36:30,188
Those clams are chump change
compared to what we're gonna make tonight.

412
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,791
No, I can't do it. I'm done.

413
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:36,214
Hey, you can't be done.
I haven't even told you the best part.

414
00:36:36,314 --> 00:36:40,999
The main event is going to be a rematch
between you and CM Punkrock.

415
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:45,236
That's not the best part. That sounds like
the worst part. That fellow scares me.

416
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:49,140
You know what your problem is, Barney?
You got no vision.

417
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,644
- You're not dreaming big enough.
- You got clam-fever, Fred.

418
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:57,746
Think about the girls. Think about the kids.
Think about the umbrella drinks.

419
00:36:58,782 --> 00:37:02,087
- You're right, Barney.
- You were really freaking me out.

420
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:06,188
- I'm going to get the clams.
- Good. Good, Fred.

421
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:09,694
I'm gonna get all the clams.

422
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:13,267
- You say something?
- Nope, not a word.

423
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:41,891
Welcome, Bedrock,
to the Saturday night spectacle.

424
00:37:46,563 --> 00:37:51,603
A few days ago, I was just some
schlub working at the quarry.

425
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:56,973
But now look at me.
Fancy suit, sunglasses, pinky ring.

426
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:00,303
I'm swimming in clams

427
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:05,481
and it's all because I didn't give up
on a dream I've had for almost a week.

428
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,790
I found the meanest, the toughest,

429
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,993
the wildest superstars in Bedrock

430
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:19,495
and they're here tonight
to serve up a beatdown!

431
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,533
John Cenastone!

432
00:38:25,168 --> 00:38:28,370
Rey Mysteriopal.

433
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,907
And The Undertaker.

434
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,014
Barney! Barney!

435
00:38:36,495 --> 00:38:41,119
Yeah, about that... Now, I know I may
have said something about a rematch

436
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:43,506
between Barney and CM Punkrock...

437
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:49,491
But Barney couldn't make it tonight.

438
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:55,564
Forget Barney.
Who needs Rubble when you got me?

439
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:01,970
And these guys.
You can't forget about these guys.

440
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,477
Fellas, what's the big deal?

441
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:09,214
- Forget Barney?
- He's your best friend.

442
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:12,050
"Was" my best friend.

443
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:16,152
And he's gonna be sorry
when I take me straight to the top.

444
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,860
Us. Us straight to the top. I meant us.

445
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,395
Listen. You two are up first.

446
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,532
But I can't have any more
good-natured tickle fights.

447
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:30,568
I want to see you two
destroy each other.

448
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,470
But we like each other.

449
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,074
Not anymore, you don't.
The people want drama.

450
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:40,745
So from now on you're enemies who can't
wait to tear each other's heads off.

451
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:43,314
In a family-friendly way, of course.

452
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,384
Mr. Flintstone, this isn't really
what we signed up for.

453
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:49,654
Fame, fortune. What more could you want?

454
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:53,224
- Friends.
- No Barney, no us.

455
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:58,694
- Wait. Guys.
- Not cool, Fred. Not cool.

456
00:40:01,064 --> 00:40:05,234
The Undertaker, I thought we were buds.

457
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:14,012
Oh, boy.

458
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:18,850
You offended your superstars,
you lied to your best friend,

459
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,154
you lost your vacation fund. Again.

460
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:28,960
Fred Flintstone, you bonehead.
What have you done?

461
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,894
Where is he? Where is Rubble?

462
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:38,279
That Kangahop-loving shrimpo,
Barney Dumbbell

463
00:40:38,379 --> 00:40:40,505
may have got lucky the first time,

464
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:44,973
but it looks like he's too chicken
to face me again.

465
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:47,979
Maybe that chicken is a turkey.

466
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,298
Good one, sis.

467
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:53,651
- We want Rubble!
- Where is he?

468
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,018
Coward!

469
00:40:55,253 --> 00:41:00,158
I came for a rematch
and I want my rematch!

470
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:02,627
Rematch! Rematch!

471
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:06,900
Rematch! Rematch! Rematch! Rematch!

472
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,469
Let's get out of here.
Rubble isn't going to show.

473
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:15,473
Hey! Barney Rubble is my best friend,

474
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:18,509
but I lied to him and told him
this match was canceled.

475
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:24,212
So, maybe it's time I make things right
and get in the ring myself.

476
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:31,089
I'm gonna destroy you.

477
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:34,123
Let's yabba dabba do this!

478
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:43,968
I still can't believe
we're all going to Rockapulco.

479
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:49,825
Yeah. For once it seems like one of Fred's
crazy schemes actually paid off.

480
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:53,011
Betty, Wilma?
You might want to see this.

481
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:54,210
Fred!

482
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,017
Dada.

483
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,192
I didn't think he was
gonna go through with it.

484
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,627
He said he was going to get
the vacation fund back.

485
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:15,400
Come on, Flintstone.
The people want a show.

486
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,735
You would think our radiant
hotness would be enough.

487
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,943
Maybe we need to turn up the heat.

488
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,244
Give the people what they want.

489
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:30,019
- Who are those girls?
- It doesn't matter, Betty.

490
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:34,684
Because all the well-toned muscle
and over-priced hair product in the world

491
00:42:34,784 --> 00:42:36,018
can't save them.

492
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:49,298
This is more fun
than making a Hopakang cry.

493
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,870
He's a Hopparoo!

494
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,880
Did I do that?

495
00:43:09,886 --> 00:43:12,054
That's what I do!

496
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:21,299
Pretty lights!

497
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,926
Thanks, fellas.

498
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:52,831
The Undertaker.

499
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:56,656
Hi, buddy, great to see... You?

500
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:06,541
You're messing with the world's
strongest caveman!

501
00:44:08,678 --> 00:44:12,281
Rest in peace!

502
00:44:23,628 --> 00:44:29,665
There's only one best in the
prehistoric world and that's me!

503
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:33,079
This is getting ridiculous.

504
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:02,891
Nobody hurts my friend.
Got it, mister?

505
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,886
- We were just...
- Leaving.

506
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,626
Barney! You saved me!

507
00:46:20,726 --> 00:46:22,847
Fred you would have
done the same for me.

508
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:27,251
I was a real jerk. If I'd have listened
to you in the first place,

509
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,987
we wouldn't have gotten caught up
in all these hijinks.

510
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:34,289
If it wasn't for hijinks,
we wouldn't have any jinks at all.

511
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:45,970
Bamm! Bamm! Bamm! Bamm!

512
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,373
Wow. That kid's got some serious skills.

513
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,191
Don't even think about it, Fred.

514
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,215
I know what you're gonna say, Wilma.

515
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:00,918
But I swear, this time I'm done.

516
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,685
I'm just glad you're okay, Fred.

517
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:14,298
Flintstone, where are you going?
You can't leave now.

518
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:17,268
This is a big time idea you've got here.

519
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:20,338
I'm not looking
for the big time, Mr. McMagma.

520
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:24,342
I was just looking to take my family
and friends to Rockapulco.

521
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:29,814
Hey, why don't you take the idea?
You'd be doing me a favor.

522
00:47:29,914 --> 00:47:33,117
Then the least I can do is send you
on an all-expense paid trip.

523
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:36,926
- Drinks and gratuities included?
- It would be my pleasure.

524
00:47:37,026 --> 00:47:40,558
I'm going to make the biggest sports
entertainment company in the world,

525
00:47:40,658 --> 00:47:44,292
even if it takes me 65 million years.

526
00:47:48,664 --> 00:47:52,903
Rockapulco with my best girl
and my best friends.

527
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,072
It couldn't be more perfect.

528
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:59,310
Yeah, Fred, I have to give it to you.
Your harebrained scheme actually paid off.

529
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,379
Barney, don't encourage him.

530
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:04,548
He's just lucky Mr. Slate
gave him his job back.

531
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:09,353
He had to. Turns out clam fever
was an actual medical condition.

532
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:13,190
You know, when you think about it,
I was a victim in this whole thing.

533
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:18,162
- Fred.
- Don't worry, Wilma. I learnt my lesson.

534
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:20,331
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

535
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:24,935
The karaoke contest is about
to begin in the hotel lounge.

536
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:28,072
Karaoke contest? That sounds like fun.

537
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:31,108
Forget it, Barn. We're here to relax.

538
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:33,778
We're not getting caught up
in anymore hijinks.

539
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:37,915
The first place winner will automatically
make it into the top 10

540
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:41,686
on this year's
season of Prehistoric Idol.

541
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:45,448
Your singing career starts here, folks.

542
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:55,893
- Should we try to stop them?
- Would it matter if we did?

543
00:48:57,201 --> 00:48:59,769
Yabba dabba doo!
