1
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:48,447
Hey, I'm on my way.
I'm so late. I'm sorry.

2
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:51,166
Say that again.
You're breaking up.

3
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,207
Say it again.

4
00:00:53,207 --> 00:00:55,487
Are you there?
Are you there?

5
00:00:55,487 --> 00:00:56,727
Damn it.

6
00:01:01,568 --> 00:01:03,008
[horn honking]

7
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:04,208
[brakes screeching]

8
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:05,847
[crashing sound,
glass breaking]

9
00:01:05,847 --> 00:01:09,089
[monitor beeping]

10
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:07,652
Mr. Kemp?

11
00:02:09,932 --> 00:02:12,011
Mr. Kemp.

12
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:14,132
I'm Charlie Moore.

13
00:02:14,132 --> 00:02:15,533
They tell us you can talk now,

14
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:17,132
and your condition is stable.

15
00:02:17,132 --> 00:02:18,612
You're doing all right.

16
00:02:18,612 --> 00:02:20,573
Can I have that in writing?

17
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,292
I'll see what I can do.

18
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:25,414
If you're up to it,
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

19
00:02:25,414 --> 00:02:26,773
Okay.

20
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:29,534
Do you remember
anything about what happened?

21
00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:33,013
Well, I remember
leaving my office
that Friday afternoon.

22
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:37,414
I was driving out to the country
to have dinner with a client.

23
00:02:37,414 --> 00:02:39,495
After that,
I'm a total blank.

24
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:41,814
Until I woke up in I.C.U.

25
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:43,935
So, you're missing a whole week.

26
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:47,094
Yeah. If you come across it,
I'd like to have it back again.

27
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:48,935
Will do.

28
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,294
Who's Franklin Porter?

29
00:02:51,294 --> 00:02:53,935
It's one of my partners.

30
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:56,054
Manuel Hastings?

31
00:02:56,054 --> 00:02:57,576
It's a client.

32
00:02:57,576 --> 00:03:00,416
We're doing
a big project downtown
in New Woolrich

33
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,456
Performing Art Center
and I'm the architect.

34
00:03:03,456 --> 00:03:06,056
At least I was.

35
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:08,176
They tell you
the first person on the scene

36
00:03:08,176 --> 00:03:10,496
was a guy who was
a medic in Viet Nam?

37
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:13,816
Yeah. I was
lying there on the pavement
and my neck was broken.

38
00:03:13,816 --> 00:03:16,216
I wasn't breathing.
And this guy came along

39
00:03:16,216 --> 00:03:18,817
and he literally took
a Swiss army knife

40
00:03:18,817 --> 00:03:22,337
and dug a hole in my throat
and stuck a straw in it.

41
00:03:22,337 --> 00:03:23,937
And saved my life.

42
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,137
Lucky he happened by.

43
00:03:26,137 --> 00:03:28,897
Sometimes I wished
he'd been running

44
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:31,137
five minutes late that night.

45
00:03:32,857 --> 00:03:35,659
- Was it my fault?
- We're not sure yet.

46
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:37,938
- It's been three weeks.
- It's been four.

47
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:39,659
You're missing one, remember?

48
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,578
We have no witnesses
to the actual crash.

49
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:44,498
The other driver's
blood alcohol level
was slightly elevated.

50
00:03:44,498 --> 00:03:48,018
And judging from impact,
you were both
doing the obligatory

51
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:49,619
ten miles an hour
over the speed limit.

52
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:51,858
What's the other driver
have to say?

53
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:53,859
They didn't tell you?

54
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,699
She died at the scene.

55
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:23,380
[monitor sounding]

56
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:31,461
[tongue clicking continuously]

57
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:40,303
Okay, Jason.

58
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:42,542
We're gonna get you
hooked up and breathing again.

59
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:46,064
We're gonna find it, okay?
You just hang on, okay?

60
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:48,743
It's okay. We're
gonna find it.

61
00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:52,583
Where the hell is it?

62
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,383
You just stay calm, okay?
You stay calm.

63
00:04:55,383 --> 00:04:58,504
I've got a pop-off in 111!
I need assistance, stat!

64
00:04:58,504 --> 00:05:00,625
I need assistance
in 111, stat!

65
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,703
I need assistance, please!

66
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,304
You just hang on, okay?
Just stay with me.

67
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,783
- I got him.
- Sorry.

68
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:09,265
I couldn't find it.

69
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:11,703
I couldn't find it.
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:15,264
There it is.

71
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:18,944
Okay.

72
00:05:19,826 --> 00:05:21,665
[muttering]

73
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:26,784
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,186
Sorry.

75
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:38,786
It'll be okay.

76
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:04,108
Take out.

77
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:50,431
Eighteen...

78
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:53,150
Nineteen...

79
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,911
Pull it. Come on,
buddy. One more.

80
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:58,232
- Twenty.
- Come on, big man.

81
00:06:58,232 --> 00:07:00,952
We've got to increase the reps
on the right side. You got to
give me another 20.

82
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:03,751
- Ah, man, I can't.
- We'll work through it.

83
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:05,592
My right side's
not firing today. I'm done.

84
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,952
Man, you've got to get
the right side working.
You're gonna need it

85
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:09,753
when they find that cure
you're always talking about.

86
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:13,312
- Ah, shut up. I hate you.
- I hate you back.

87
00:07:13,312 --> 00:07:14,993
I hate you, too.

88
00:07:14,993 --> 00:07:17,553
All right, another 20.
Here we go.

89
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:19,753
Okay. One, good. Two...

90
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:23,193
- That's the spirit.
- All right. Three...

91
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,793
That-a-boy.
Four...

92
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:27,753
five...

93
00:07:38,715 --> 00:07:41,235
One more time.
There.

94
00:07:44,194 --> 00:07:45,235
Good catch, son.

95
00:07:47,155 --> 00:07:48,235
One more.

96
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:49,875
There you go.

97
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,516
Hey, Leila.

98
00:07:57,635 --> 00:08:00,316
I was beginning to think
you stood me up, so to speak.

99
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:01,796
Very funny.

100
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:05,036
Yeah. I'm working on an act
to take it on the road.

101
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:06,996
I stopped by the loft.
Coming along.

102
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:09,876
Contractors just doing
some last minute touch-ups.

103
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:12,436
This renovation's
taking forever.
But I tell you something,

104
00:08:12,436 --> 00:08:13,756
I've got to get out
of here, Leila.

105
00:08:13,756 --> 00:08:16,277
- I really am going crazy.
- One more day.

106
00:08:16,277 --> 00:08:18,357
Everything is still on track
for you to go in tomorrow.

107
00:08:18,357 --> 00:08:20,877
- Good.
- Is that ours?

108
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:22,198
Yep.

109
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:25,237
I wanted to show you
what a good host I am.

110
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:28,317
And wait till you see it.
It's magnificent.

111
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,558
I admit, I had no idea
how expensive this was
all going to be.

112
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:35,918
The lift alone, my God.

113
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,558
Well, I've got
to get up and down
between three floors.

114
00:08:39,558 --> 00:08:41,999
You know, I still think
you could've consolidated it
on one floor.

115
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,918
Yeah, I've got all my
gym equipment, I got
nurses, there's me.

116
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:45,358
We can't live on one floor.

117
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,199
You sure you need all that
high-tech exercise stuff?

118
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:51,960
That stuff is gonna get
my body ready so that when the
scientists have found a cure,

119
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,359
I'll be able
to get up and walk, okay?

120
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:58,240
- I know. It's just...
- It's just what?

121
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,481
I just whoever sold you
all that expensive equipment

122
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:04,559
- isn't taking advantage of you.
- What are you talking about?

123
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:07,362
Your vulnerability.
Your frame of mind.

124
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:09,081
What?

125
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:12,002
This wish for a full recovery.

126
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:14,121
This wish is a
reasonable expectation

127
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:18,280
based on the latest
scientific research. Okay?

128
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,762
Fine.

129
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:22,920
I believe you.

130
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,841
I do.

131
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:26,722
Oh, boy.

132
00:09:26,722 --> 00:09:28,442
Now I get it.
Now I get it.

133
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,203
You went by the loft and saw
how expensive everything was,

134
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,922
and now you're
worried about my finances.

135
00:09:33,922 --> 00:09:35,803
- I'm concerned, yes.
- About your alimony.

136
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:39,162
Jason, it's not that.
I see all this money
flying out the window.

137
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,083
Do you have any idea how
expensive it is to be disabled

138
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,403
in this country?
The sooner I get back to work,

139
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:46,643
the better it's gonna be
for both of us. Okay?

140
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:48,803
Forget I said anything about it.

141
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:53,963
Look. Whatever happens,
I will not shirk my obligations

142
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:55,684
- to you.
- I know that.

143
00:09:55,684 --> 00:09:57,765
I really do appreciate
everything you've done

144
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:00,444
while I've been here.
Most ex-wives

145
00:10:00,444 --> 00:10:01,964
wouldn't even
show up in rehab.

146
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:05,965
Look. I've got to go.
I'm running late.

147
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:07,004
Okay.

148
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:10,485
I'll see you soon.

149
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,965
- Have a good trip home, okay?
- Yep.

150
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:25,205
Enjoying those blueberries?

151
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:27,245
Ah, thanks for
bringing them in, man.

152
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:28,685
No problem.

153
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:30,486
I hear you had
another pop-off last night.

154
00:10:30,486 --> 00:10:32,567
Yeah, I'm getting
used to them.

155
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,366
Not like the first time, eh?

156
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:37,767
I don't know who was more
scared, you or that nurse.

157
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,967
Thanks, Mary.
That's plenty.

158
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:42,007
What are we waiting for?
Let's go home.

159
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:44,406
I'll tell you what.
You get that van around
here in ten minutes,

160
00:10:44,406 --> 00:10:46,127
or I'm gonna
leave without you.

161
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:48,327
Find me booking down
the Jersey turnpike.

162
00:10:48,327 --> 00:10:50,807
We'll get you a racing stripe
and some chrome mag wheels

163
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:52,328
- for that Jalopy?
- That's a deal, brother.

164
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:54,047
You got to go see
the doctor first.

165
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:56,528
- No we don't.
- Yep.

166
00:10:56,528 --> 00:10:58,128
- Let's go.
- All right.

167
00:10:58,128 --> 00:11:00,288
If we have to, we have to.

168
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:03,129
You've been absolutely terrific,
Dr. Schneider, and I hope
I never see you again

169
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,048
the rest of my life.

170
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:08,368
We never had a patient
quite like you, Jason,
quite so driven.

171
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,569
Your work ethic.
Your determination.

172
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,930
Formidable.
You really impressed me.

173
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,408
Listen now, when you go
home, don't overdo it.
You need time to rest.

174
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,369
I can't afford to rest.

175
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:19,850
If they come up with a cure,
I got to be ready.

176
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,490
Like I said, "Driven."
Who's taking you home?

177
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,849
Antonio.

178
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,570
I can't believe you
hired him away from us.

179
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,210
Well, if you paid these guys
a decent wage...

180
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,649
Ah, the man of the hour.

181
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:31,851
Okay. See you
in six months.

182
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:34,290
Antonio: Ready to roll?

183
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,491
Jason: Hey, Antonio,
slow down, will you?

184
00:11:36,491 --> 00:11:39,250
Antonio: I'm way under
the speed limit, man, okay?
Just relax, now.

185
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,811
After six months of going
three miles an hour, this feels
like Warp Speed.

186
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:45,010
Man, I go any slower,
somebody' rear end us.

187
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,811
Now you just calm down, okay?
Just relax, we get there
safe and sound.

188
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:51,011
See, I told you, man.

189
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,293
You get to live to die
another day.

190
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:56,652
Jason: That's good.
'Cause I got a meeting
with my partners up stairs.

191
00:11:58,132 --> 00:12:00,612
- I'll meet you up there.
- All right.

192
00:12:00,612 --> 00:12:02,612
You a lucky man,
you know that?

193
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:04,091
How do you figure that?

194
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:06,533
You cheated death how many
times so far, three, four?

195
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:08,612
Well, five,
counting that ride.

196
00:12:08,612 --> 00:12:11,453
Must be a reason you've
been at death's door
and back so many times.

197
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:12,933
It was an accident.

198
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,333
Somebody got careless
and crossed the yellow line.

199
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,374
- How lucky is that?
- I'm telling you, man.

200
00:12:17,374 --> 00:12:18,973
Got to be a reason
you survived.

201
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:22,333
Well, if you figure it out,
let me know.

202
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,814
Hey, guys.

203
00:12:24,814 --> 00:12:26,134
Jason.

204
00:12:26,134 --> 00:12:28,054
Border and Mays,
how are you?

205
00:12:28,054 --> 00:12:29,093
You look great.

206
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:30,934
I look like hell.

207
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:34,133
- Remarkably fit, considering.
- We've been looking around.

208
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:36,854
The place
turned out beautifully.

209
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:40,335
Man.
Yeah, you're right.

210
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:42,015
It looks great.

211
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:43,934
Which one of you
took my pool table?

212
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:49,655
Okay, Antonio.
Let's look around.

213
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:51,496
What happened
to my retirement money?

214
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:54,975
Jason, you don't have
to worry about money.

215
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,536
The firm is doing fine.

216
00:12:56,536 --> 00:12:58,776
Without me?
That's very reassuring.

217
00:12:58,776 --> 00:13:00,136
No, you were right.

218
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:01,816
They were able
to re-wire the monitors

219
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:04,616
to give you
voice-access to the computer
from every floor.

220
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:06,737
Per your specifications,
the lift is triggered
automatically

221
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:09,937
by sensors
in your wheelchair,
as are the lights.

222
00:13:09,937 --> 00:13:12,138
Also per your specs,
you can turn them off
with your sipping straw.

223
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:16,257
A code overrides the sensors.
You can lock the doors to the
lift that way, too .

224
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:18,338
We don't recommend that,
for obvious reasons.

225
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:22,258
If you were me,
you'd be dying to lock
a door sometimes.

226
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:23,458
[elevator bell dings]

227
00:13:26,738 --> 00:13:30,458
Ah, this is very nice.
Nice job.

228
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,018
Let's go take
a look at the view.

229
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:39,539
Same old bricks.

230
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:42,339
I guess I'm gonna
have to get used to this view.

231
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:45,459
Hey, it looks like those guys
over there redecorated.

232
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:47,460
Not too bad.

233
00:13:50,219 --> 00:13:52,940
- What's going on up there?
- A major renovation.

234
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,300
Putting together
10,000 square feet
for a Spartina gallery.

235
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,901
- Spending some real dough.
- Who's the architect?

236
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:02,421
- Hollingsworth.
- Bud Hollingsworth?

237
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:05,260
He couldn't design
the stalls in a men's room.

238
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,381
[laughter]

239
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:11,621
You know, I always wondered
what went on over there
during the day.

240
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:15,382
Nothing much.
But, anyway...

241
00:14:15,382 --> 00:14:17,181
Time to get back to work
on the Woolrich project.

242
00:14:18,462 --> 00:14:20,942
Starting tomorrow,
I'll be on it again full-time.

243
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:23,382
Jason, the site's
already been excavated.

244
00:14:23,382 --> 00:14:25,661
They're pouring the foundation
as we speak, they begin framing
next week.

245
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:29,662
- Now, wait a minute, here,
how did that happen?
- We had to re-assign it.

246
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:32,062
- We made an agreement.
- What can I tell you?

247
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:34,103
- The client...
- Insisted.

248
00:14:34,103 --> 00:14:38,783
Wasn't confident
you'd return to work with all
your former resources intact.

249
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:44,862
- So, who'd you give it to?
- Claudia Henderson.

250
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:48,504
- Actually, she's very talented.
- Well, that's good.

251
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:51,104
'Cause then you won't
have any problem

252
00:14:51,104 --> 00:14:52,985
giving her something else
to do. 'Cause I'm back

253
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:54,623
with my resources intact.

254
00:14:54,623 --> 00:14:58,304
The Woolrich Center is
mine. Antonio.

255
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:00,944
I don't believe you two.

256
00:15:00,944 --> 00:15:02,345
We can give
Woolrich back to you if...

257
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:04,584
Yeah, you sure can.
You don't have a choice.

258
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:07,225
But we're not
taking it away from Claudia.
She's been working

259
00:15:07,225 --> 00:15:10,025
her ass off for six months.
And I got to tell you,

260
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:12,345
the client is very happy
with the work she's been doing.

261
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,545
You guys don't waste
much time, do you?

262
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:17,225
Did you give
the job away when I was on
the operating table?

263
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:19,826
'Cause you didn't think I'd
survive the surgery, is that it?

264
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:22,226
We didn't know
what would happen.

265
00:15:22,226 --> 00:15:25,226
You're gonna have to learn
to work with her.

266
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:27,666
Look on the bright side.
Somebody's got to do all those

267
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,306
- boring lunches...
- Oh, the bright side.

268
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:35,506
Interesting way to describe
stabbing me in the back.

269
00:15:37,948 --> 00:15:39,746
Come on. We got to
beat him downstairs.

270
00:15:39,746 --> 00:15:42,027
- Same old Jason.
- Only more so.

271
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:47,468
- Surprise.
- Gotcha.

272
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:49,108
- Sorry, Jas.
- Oh, no.

273
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:52,268
How did I get down here?

274
00:15:52,268 --> 00:15:55,507
Welcome home, Jason.

275
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:56,908
Oh, this is too much.

276
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:01,508
Hi, everybody.
It's so good to see you.

277
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:04,389
- You look great.
- Hi, Susan. How are you?

278
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:06,910
- You look great.
- Welcome back, Jason.

279
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,108
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

280
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,830
- We missed you.
- Thank you.

281
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,710
Gents, where do
I find Mr. Kemp?

282
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,151
- Right over there.
- Thanks.

283
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:36,110
- How are you holding up?
- Hi.

284
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,232
A little overwhelming,
all this attention.

285
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:40,831
Listen. I came to tell you.
We went outside the department,

286
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:44,152
did some computer modeling,
and reenacted the accident.

287
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:46,191
- And...?
- It's her fault.

288
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:48,872
She swerved over
the center line.
No double about it.

289
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:50,912
So, for whatever it's worth,

290
00:16:50,912 --> 00:16:53,873
you're not to blame.

291
00:16:53,873 --> 00:16:56,992
Thank you.
This thing's really been
weighing on my mind.

292
00:16:56,992 --> 00:17:00,592
Yeah, well,
that's why I came to tell you.

293
00:17:00,592 --> 00:17:02,712
And pay my respects. So...

294
00:17:02,712 --> 00:17:05,752
Well, next time
there's a homicide
in the neighborhood,

295
00:17:05,752 --> 00:17:08,513
- feel free to drop by.
- I'll do that. See ya.

296
00:17:12,794 --> 00:17:16,553
I want you
to get some rest, big shot.
We'll see you.

297
00:17:16,553 --> 00:17:18,755
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

298
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:23,834
Jason, sorry about yesterday.

299
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,274
I shouldn't have burdened you
with my money anxieties.

300
00:17:27,274 --> 00:17:29,275
Seeing this place
put me in a panic.

301
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:30,914
It's okay.

302
00:17:32,315 --> 00:17:35,995
Jason, there's something
I've been trying to tell you.

303
00:17:35,995 --> 00:17:37,795
I've been seeing someone.

304
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:39,836
And it's serious.

305
00:17:42,555 --> 00:17:44,036
Wow.

306
00:17:46,355 --> 00:17:48,116
Congratulations.

307
00:17:49,597 --> 00:17:51,516
Look on the bright side.
If it works out,

308
00:17:51,516 --> 00:17:53,636
- no more alimony.
- I'll light a candle.

309
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:58,197
I know you'll make something
good out of all this.

310
00:18:02,157 --> 00:18:03,237
You always do.

311
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:05,717
Goodbye.

312
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:12,957
Take care.

313
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,879
Hey, you see that
blond down there?

314
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:38,879
Yeah, man.

315
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:42,039
Wave back to her for me.

316
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:20,047
[telephone ringing]

317
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,927
[elevator bell dings]

318
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:37,127
All right,
there you go.

319
00:20:37,127 --> 00:20:39,447
Enjoy your party, man?

320
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,607
Well, after a while,

321
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:45,008
too much Vivaldi
can sort of make you seasick.

322
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:48,328
I know what you mean.
I feel the same way
about Phillip Glass.

323
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:49,568
Phillip Glass?

324
00:20:49,568 --> 00:20:51,248
You think all I listen to
is Reggae Music?

325
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:52,648
Uh-huh.

326
00:20:52,648 --> 00:20:55,168
Alison downstairs,
she's got me on duty all night.

327
00:20:55,168 --> 00:20:57,649
If you need anything,
you just click.

328
00:20:57,649 --> 00:21:01,489
I got my phone number
and beeper number
hot-wired to your computer.

329
00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:03,128
Alison call me,

330
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,689
I'll be here before you can say,
Rastafarian and Rehabilitation.

331
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:08,050
I think you're
overqualified for this job.

332
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,449
I think so, too.

333
00:21:09,449 --> 00:21:11,769
- Would you do me a favor?
- Yeah, man.

334
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,970
Open my closet.
I'd like to take a look.

335
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,010
All right.

336
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:17,850
Here you go.

337
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,490
Ah.

338
00:21:50,012 --> 00:21:53,333
And put on your dancing shoes.

339
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,454
Bring up
Woolrich Projects
subcontractors.

340
00:22:05,454 --> 00:22:07,453
Display a list
of Marble vendors.

341
00:22:07,453 --> 00:22:10,294
Todd, bring up
Marble selections.

342
00:22:10,294 --> 00:22:13,213
Hey, Janet,
get me a lemonade, please?
I'm real thirsty.

343
00:22:13,213 --> 00:22:16,893
I would
if I knew where it was.

344
00:22:18,013 --> 00:22:20,494
Mr. Kemp. Hi.
Claudia Henderson.

345
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,655
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry. Habit.

346
00:22:24,655 --> 00:22:27,014
Oh, forget it.
People do it to me all the time.

347
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:28,334
The front door was open,
so I just came in.

348
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:30,174
I hope you don't mind.

349
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:32,495
You know,
my front door is always open.

350
00:22:32,495 --> 00:22:35,416
I got nurses. I got aides.
I got delivery people.

351
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:38,375
The whole world just kind of
comes and goes as it pleases.

352
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:39,896
You don't know who I am,
do you?

353
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:41,815
Sure I do.
You're the new girl.

354
00:22:41,815 --> 00:22:45,256
I'm sorry. Porter said
you were the talented, new girl.

355
00:22:46,297 --> 00:22:48,056
At least
he called me "talented."

356
00:22:48,056 --> 00:22:51,176
So, you've been
working on my project
keeping it warm for me?

357
00:22:51,176 --> 00:22:53,376
Well, I hope I've been doing
a little more than that.

358
00:22:53,376 --> 00:22:55,016
Actually,
I hope you haven't.

359
00:22:55,016 --> 00:22:58,617
- You know, we've met before.
- I don't think so.

360
00:22:58,617 --> 00:23:02,457
I joined the firm
the week before your accident.

361
00:23:02,457 --> 00:23:05,018
We met at a staff meeting
on Friday afternoon.

362
00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:07,057
You'll have to forgive me.
Ordinarily I'd remember, but...

363
00:23:07,057 --> 00:23:08,978
There's no reason
that you should.

364
00:23:08,978 --> 00:23:11,337
No, in fact,
I have a photographic memory
for names, faces, blueprints,

365
00:23:11,337 --> 00:23:15,378
trivial statistics.
But I don't have any memory

366
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:18,138
from that Friday afternoon
until the accident.

367
00:23:18,138 --> 00:23:20,578
It's gone. It's erased
from the hard drive.

368
00:23:20,578 --> 00:23:22,578
- It never happened.
- It must be disconcerting

369
00:23:22,578 --> 00:23:24,138
to have a gap
in your memory like that.

370
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:25,779
Thank you.

371
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:29,899
Yep. It's just about
the same size as the gap
in my spinal cord.

372
00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:32,979
I'm sorry.
I'm not very good at this.

373
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:34,419
Well, who is?

374
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:36,260
Most people don't even
know how to look me in the eye.

375
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,499
This wheelchair
just kind of freaks them out.

376
00:23:39,499 --> 00:23:42,219
I have to admit,
I'm a little bit
freaked out myself.

377
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:44,701
- Um, should we get started?
- Yeah.

378
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:47,380
I have a
few questions first.

379
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,580
I thought you might.

380
00:25:55,749 --> 00:25:57,789
Okay. I'm trying
to set a meeting with

381
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,789
Woolrich's project point person
do discuss furnishings, fabrics,

382
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:03,188
wallpaper, paint colors...

383
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:05,790
- You want to join us?
- I'd rather drink--

384
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,109
Don't finish that.
I'll take the meeting.

385
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:11,510
I can't seem to find a vendor
to supply the Olivine Marble.

386
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:14,230
- What about Lombardi?
- Bankrupt.

387
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,910
You might want to start
thinking about alternatives.

388
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,869
Tell Polutzi to give me a price.

389
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:20,071
- Tell him?
- He owes me.

390
00:26:20,071 --> 00:26:21,871
Gotcha.

391
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,871
Sorry. Could you just ask Janet
to come up a minute?

392
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:27,271
- Sure. What do you need?
- Just anything to drink.

393
00:26:27,271 --> 00:26:29,671
- My throat's killing me.
- I'll get it.

394
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,391
- You don't mind?
- Of course not.

395
00:26:31,391 --> 00:26:32,431
Thanks.

396
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:36,151
And the straws
are right by the glasses.

397
00:26:36,151 --> 00:26:37,432
Got it.

398
00:26:37,432 --> 00:26:39,272
Bring up "Interior Tiles."

399
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:45,512
Show "Wall Selections."

400
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:47,113
[computer beeping]

401
00:26:47,113 --> 00:26:48,552
Choose "2."

402
00:26:48,552 --> 00:26:54,033
And bring up
"Floor Selections."

403
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:55,713
Choose "3."

404
00:26:59,152 --> 00:27:01,034
And bring up "Sconces."

405
00:27:06,713 --> 00:27:08,433
Thanks.

406
00:27:08,433 --> 00:27:09,954
Okay.
Where were we?

407
00:27:09,954 --> 00:27:12,394
"Sconces."

408
00:27:12,394 --> 00:27:16,354
Call Lattimer & Fitzentrous
and accept no substitutes.

409
00:27:16,354 --> 00:27:17,315
I'm impressed.

410
00:27:17,315 --> 00:27:19,595
God is in the details.

411
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:14,798
[telephone ringing]

412
00:28:46,881 --> 00:28:50,360
Hey, man.
Whatcha doin' sitting here
in the dark?

413
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,921
I'm spying on my neighbors.
I think she's just discovered

414
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:57,041
her husband's got
an online girlfriend.

415
00:28:57,041 --> 00:29:00,722
Oh. Now she's really
reading him the riot act.

416
00:29:00,722 --> 00:29:03,322
- Serious mellodrama.
- I'm telling you.

417
00:29:03,322 --> 00:29:06,882
I'm gonna have
to get you one of those
surveillance devices,

418
00:29:06,882 --> 00:29:10,482
get you that
all-important bird's-eye view.

419
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:13,482
Would that make me
a Bonifide Peeping Tom?

420
00:29:13,482 --> 00:29:15,322
- Definitely.
- Go for it.

421
00:29:15,322 --> 00:29:17,323
Ready for bed now?

422
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:20,162
No. I want to stay up a while.
You know, like a grownup.

423
00:29:20,162 --> 00:29:22,123
I got a lady friend
I can go see.

424
00:29:22,123 --> 00:29:23,444
Beautiful.

425
00:29:23,444 --> 00:29:26,324
So she caught him
cheating on the Internet, huh?

426
00:29:28,963 --> 00:29:31,404
You thinking
about fooling around
in cyberspace, man?

427
00:29:31,404 --> 00:29:32,844
Well...

428
00:29:32,844 --> 00:29:36,443
about the only way I can
fool around right now.

429
00:29:37,924 --> 00:29:39,444
It wasn't always that way.

430
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,124
You were a lady's man
back in the day?

431
00:29:41,124 --> 00:29:43,484
- I did okay.
- I bet you did.

432
00:29:45,204 --> 00:29:47,405
- Fix you that surveillance.
- Thanks.

433
00:30:59,449 --> 00:31:00,489
[shouting]

434
00:31:18,972 --> 00:31:21,571
Achilles,
bring up "Telephone."

435
00:31:21,571 --> 00:31:24,771
[computer beeping]

436
00:31:24,771 --> 00:31:26,051
Dial 9-1-1.

437
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,011
[beeping sounds]

438
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,651
9-1-1 operator.

439
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:31,331
I need to report
a domestic altercation.

440
00:31:31,331 --> 00:31:33,892
Operator: Can you describe
what's happening, sir?

441
00:32:11,455 --> 00:32:13,295
Antonio:
Tell me when it's in focus.

442
00:32:13,295 --> 00:32:14,574
Jason: Ah, no, not yet.

443
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:18,935
Better?

444
00:32:18,935 --> 00:32:21,095
No, a little more.
Just tweak it a little bit.

445
00:32:21,095 --> 00:32:23,936
Yes. There.
That's perfect. Perfect.

446
00:32:23,936 --> 00:32:25,935
Great. Now how do I
operate this thing?

447
00:32:25,935 --> 00:32:27,815
Pan, zoom, tilt.
Use your straw.

448
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:29,696
Cool. All right.

449
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:33,976
I'm gonna go left.
Um...

450
00:32:33,976 --> 00:32:34,935
Oh.

451
00:32:34,935 --> 00:32:36,976
- [laughing]
- Whoops.

452
00:32:36,976 --> 00:32:38,776
I got to practice with this.

453
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:50,497
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

454
00:32:53,217 --> 00:32:54,498
I got to zoom in there.

455
00:33:11,818 --> 00:33:16,579
- Now that's odd.
- What's odd?

456
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:18,859
- What's that?
- What's it look like?

457
00:33:18,859 --> 00:33:21,059
It looks like a
personal surveillance device.

458
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:23,300
- Bird watching?
- Wildlife, definitely.

459
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,660
- Isn't this illegal?
- Probably.

460
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,260
I guess he's still
in the slammer.

461
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,780
- In the slammer?
- Yeah.

462
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,100
The sculptor across the way
beat-up his wife last night.

463
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,060
- You're kidding?
- Jason sicked the cops on him.

464
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,460
So this isn't just
cheap thrills.

465
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,100
- It's in the public interest.
- Call me Citizen Voyeur.

466
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,460
- Is he gonna come after you?
- No, I don't think so.

467
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,701
He doesn't know
I called the cops.

468
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:48,181
And I didn't
give my name to 911.

469
00:33:48,181 --> 00:33:50,662
- So what's odd?
- Well, what's odd

470
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:53,462
is that he really beat the crap
out of her last night

471
00:33:53,462 --> 00:33:56,941
and today
she doesn't look so bad.

472
00:33:56,941 --> 00:34:00,821
She's wearing a lot of makeup
for this early in the day.

473
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:02,421
This is kind of exciting.

474
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:05,102
Bet you can see some pretty
sexy stuff with this thing.

475
00:34:05,102 --> 00:34:07,222
Um, I already have.
After dark,

476
00:34:07,222 --> 00:34:11,342
this whole building
goes from a PG-13 to a hard R.

477
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:14,863
Care to be more specific?
Remember, God is in the details.

478
00:34:14,863 --> 00:34:17,622
Well, come on over some night
and see for yourself.

479
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,663
Maybe I will.
We'd probably end up
fighting over this.

480
00:34:19,663 --> 00:34:22,383
I'm putting in another one
upstairs in the bedroom.

481
00:34:22,383 --> 00:34:24,744
You guys are obsessed.

482
00:34:24,744 --> 00:34:28,303
From here I got a straight shot
right down into the loft.

483
00:34:28,303 --> 00:34:30,863
If you were my neighbor
and I knew you had this...

484
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:34,024
- Would you put on a floor show?
- Maybe.

485
00:34:34,024 --> 00:34:36,705
If we were neighbors,
I'd be watching you
the whole time.

486
00:34:36,705 --> 00:34:39,665
Yeah, sure.
Just be careful
you don't get caught.

487
00:34:39,665 --> 00:34:42,665
I think I'll go upstairs
and setup the second camera.

488
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,505
Okay, party's over.
Back to work.

489
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,705
Right behind you.

490
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:21,716
Jason: He didn't call
the cops, you creep, I did.

491
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,236
- [elevator bell dings]
- Jason?

492
00:37:34,236 --> 00:37:36,516
Oh, Alison.
You scared me to death.

493
00:37:36,516 --> 00:37:38,837
I just came up to see
if you needed anything.

494
00:37:38,837 --> 00:37:41,436
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.
- Are you ready for bed?

495
00:37:41,436 --> 00:37:43,277
- Antonio's coming at midnight.
- No problem.

496
00:37:43,277 --> 00:37:46,637
- Sorry to disturb you.
- It's okay.

497
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:13,639
[church bell tolling,
clock ticking]

498
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:19,839
[shouting,
glass breaking]

499
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,800
[shouting continues]

500
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,080
Woman: No! No! No!

501
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,440
Man: [yelling, screaming]

502
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,681
Woman: [screams]

503
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:39,241
[silence]

504
00:38:39,241 --> 00:38:41,881
[dog barking]

505
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:51,841
[electrical noises]

506
00:38:58,442 --> 00:39:01,801
[tongue clicking rapidly]

507
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:07,082
What happened?
Did you have a popoff?

508
00:39:07,082 --> 00:39:10,243
[muttering]

509
00:39:10,243 --> 00:39:12,323
Let me just check your trac.

510
00:39:15,323 --> 00:39:18,283
Go call Antonio.
Tell him to get over here.

511
00:39:18,283 --> 00:39:20,124
At three a.m.?
Do it, damn it.

512
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,763
Do it, please.

513
00:39:31,444 --> 00:39:35,005
Antonio: I hope you got
a good reason besides
you can't sleep...

514
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,725
- I'm sorry.
- I got no trouble sleeping.

515
00:39:37,725 --> 00:39:40,204
- I like sleeping.
- No, I apologize.

516
00:39:40,204 --> 00:39:42,525
I sleep like a baby, in fact.

517
00:39:42,525 --> 00:39:44,726
I apologize again.
But what time is it?

518
00:39:44,726 --> 00:39:47,766
- Almost 3:30.
- Damn, I think we missed it.

519
00:39:47,766 --> 00:39:49,566
Missed what, man?

520
00:39:49,566 --> 00:39:52,085
Whatever was
going on over there.

521
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:53,685
You sure you didn't dream it?

522
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:55,366
Ask Alison.

523
00:39:55,366 --> 00:39:58,086
There was a whole lot of racket
and commotion over there.

524
00:39:58,086 --> 00:40:01,087
And there was
some sort of light flashing.

525
00:40:01,087 --> 00:40:03,726
Well, it's quiet now.

526
00:40:03,726 --> 00:40:05,767
You see?
She's not there.

527
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:09,207
Something's happened.
Something's happened to her.

528
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:11,488
I know it.

529
00:40:21,448 --> 00:40:23,088
Sorry. Traffic.

530
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,527
Hi, Claudia.

531
00:40:24,527 --> 00:40:27,328
I'm running late myself.
I didn't get any sleep.

532
00:40:27,328 --> 00:40:30,168
You want me to come back
after you finish breakfast?

533
00:40:30,168 --> 00:40:31,689
No, it's all right.
I'm done.

534
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:33,569
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

535
00:40:35,129 --> 00:40:38,569
I talked to Charlie Moore
yesterday about our neighbors.

536
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,249
You did?
What'd you find out?

537
00:40:40,249 --> 00:40:43,169
It turns out their name is
Ilene and Julian Thorpe.

538
00:40:43,169 --> 00:40:44,849
He's a hotshot sculptor,

539
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:47,330
and she's a retired
New York gypsy.

540
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:50,569
- A fortune teller?
- No, not that kind.

541
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:53,810
A Broadway gypsy.
A chorus girl.

542
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,530
Charlie Moore says they're
gonna prosecute him for battery

543
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,049
even if she doesn't cooperate.
'Cause it's an election year,

544
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:02,210
the mayor wants to crack down
on domestic violence.

545
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,291
So he made bail last night,
he came home, and then

546
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:07,930
they had another
knockdown dragout fight.

547
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:10,411
- You're kidding?
- And then, after that,

548
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:12,571
he starts welding away
in his studio.

549
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:15,291
And I just, like,
could not sleep at all.

550
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:17,931
The night he gets home,
he lets her have it again.

551
00:41:17,931 --> 00:41:20,972
- So where is she now?
- I don't know.

552
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:23,051
I haven't seen her.
I'm worried about her.

553
00:41:23,051 --> 00:41:25,372
I can't believe
you saw them go at it again.

554
00:41:25,372 --> 00:41:27,891
I heard it, and I thought
somebody would call the cops.

555
00:41:27,891 --> 00:41:30,213
I mean,
she screamed loud enough.

556
00:41:30,213 --> 00:41:33,452
Well, maybe she's just
trying to stay out of
his way this morning.

557
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:35,572
- I know I would.
- No, you don't get it.

558
00:41:35,572 --> 00:41:37,652
This woman never
leaves the apartment.

559
00:41:37,652 --> 00:41:40,094
I mean, she doesn't even
go out for cigarettes.

560
00:41:40,094 --> 00:41:42,572
He buys all the groceries.
He buys the liquor.

561
00:41:42,572 --> 00:41:46,214
I mean,
she's a major alcoholic.
But this morning,

562
00:41:46,214 --> 00:41:49,333
this is the first time that
I haven't seen her at all.

563
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:51,974
Do you think
she'll testify against him?

564
00:41:51,974 --> 00:41:55,134
Well, she just found out
he's having an affair.

565
00:41:55,134 --> 00:41:57,533
- How do you know that?
- I saw it happen.

566
00:41:57,533 --> 00:42:00,615
- You are a nosy-parker.
- She really gave him hell.

567
00:42:00,615 --> 00:42:03,414
I think he's leaving her
for another woman.

568
00:42:03,414 --> 00:42:06,015
And when she finds that out,
she's gonna testify against him.

569
00:42:06,015 --> 00:42:07,055
Believe me.

570
00:42:09,134 --> 00:42:12,575
All right, enough speculation.
We got a lot of work to do.

571
00:42:12,575 --> 00:42:16,576
Come on. We still got some
major molding decisions to make.

572
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:56,818
97/62.

573
00:42:59,298 --> 00:43:02,299
- Hey, Alison. Jason.
- Hi, Claudia.

574
00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:05,099
- Do you need anything?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.

575
00:43:06,899 --> 00:43:09,099
- Hi.
- Hi.

576
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:11,459
- What's all that?
- Oh, I was in the neighborhood.

577
00:43:11,459 --> 00:43:13,338
I picked up a few things:

578
00:43:13,338 --> 00:43:16,499
some tomatoes, garlic,
fresh pasta.

579
00:43:16,499 --> 00:43:18,540
That is so nice of you
to come cook me dinner.

580
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,139
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I don't cook. I shop.

581
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:23,821
I thought that
maybe Alison could--

582
00:43:23,821 --> 00:43:26,060
Ah, no, Alison doesn't cook
at all, believe me.

583
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,220
What are we gonna do?

584
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,261
Ah, well,
can you boil water?

585
00:43:31,261 --> 00:43:32,541
I can try.

586
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:35,621
Okay. Grab a big pot down there.

587
00:43:35,621 --> 00:43:37,421
Pot. Okay.

588
00:43:38,941 --> 00:43:40,421
All right.

589
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:43,741
Ah, big.
It's a technical term
that means "big."

590
00:43:43,741 --> 00:43:46,622
Smart Aleck.

591
00:43:46,622 --> 00:43:48,381
A...big pot.

592
00:43:48,381 --> 00:43:49,702
That's better.

593
00:43:49,702 --> 00:43:51,742
Okay. Now you need a big knife.

594
00:43:55,022 --> 00:43:57,142
Big enough for you?

595
00:43:57,142 --> 00:43:59,062
Yeah, that's fine.

596
00:43:59,062 --> 00:44:01,023
And what you do is
you take the tomatoes,

597
00:44:01,023 --> 00:44:03,462
and you're gonna wash them
and then you dice them.

598
00:44:03,462 --> 00:44:05,023
Define "dice."

599
00:44:05,023 --> 00:44:07,664
Oh, no.
We're gonna starve.

600
00:44:09,543 --> 00:44:12,823
I can't tell you
what a relief this is
from Chinese take-away.

601
00:44:12,823 --> 00:44:15,464
I know.
I have this giant bowl
in my refrigerator

602
00:44:15,464 --> 00:44:18,064
filled with
soy sauce, duck sauce,
mustard sauce,

603
00:44:18,064 --> 00:44:20,984
literally five years
worth of take-out packets,

604
00:44:20,984 --> 00:44:23,063
thousands of
those little squirts.

605
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:31,185
Are you sure
that you don't mind doing this?

606
00:44:31,185 --> 00:44:33,344
Not at all.

607
00:44:33,344 --> 00:44:35,625
Ah, that's the part I hate.

608
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:37,426
What, the napkin?

609
00:44:37,426 --> 00:44:39,265
It makes me feel like
a big baby with a bib on.

610
00:44:39,265 --> 00:44:42,146
I think
it's kind of attractive.

611
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:45,025
It's like,
a tuxedo look without the tux.

612
00:44:46,706 --> 00:44:50,986
Would you go to the window
and see if she's come back yet?

613
00:44:50,986 --> 00:44:52,666
Yeah, sure.

614
00:44:54,906 --> 00:44:57,827
- You want that?
- Yeah, thanks.

615
00:45:00,986 --> 00:45:03,507
It looks like
her stuff is still there.

616
00:45:09,187 --> 00:45:10,988
She didn't leave him.

617
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:12,788
How can you be so sure?

618
00:45:12,788 --> 00:45:16,068
Well, her jewelry box
and perfume are still
on the dresser.

619
00:45:16,068 --> 00:45:19,508
She might leave
her husband but she's not
gonna leave her jewelry.

620
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,868
Well, that's my point.

621
00:45:20,868 --> 00:45:22,709
Something must've
happened to her.

622
00:45:22,709 --> 00:45:25,828
She probably spent the day at a
bar trying to get up the courage

623
00:45:25,828 --> 00:45:31,189
to come home.
But she's gonna come home.
She'll be remorseful.

624
00:45:31,189 --> 00:45:33,828
They'll be all
lovey-dovey for a few days.

625
00:45:33,828 --> 00:45:36,629
And then
they'll go at it again.
Relationships like that

626
00:45:36,629 --> 00:45:39,629
are far too complicated
to understand from the outside.

627
00:45:39,629 --> 00:45:43,190
Next time, do us all a favor
and don't call 911.

628
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:47,511
I'm not sure
there's gonna be a next time.

629
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:53,231
I think
he killed her last night.

630
00:45:53,231 --> 00:45:55,511
Detective:
Run that by me again.

631
00:45:55,511 --> 00:45:59,270
Jason: So he comes home
and tells her he's gonna
leave her for another woman.

632
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:02,111
She threatens to testify
against him and ruin his life.

633
00:46:02,111 --> 00:46:04,151
Then they have a fight,
and this time he kills her.

634
00:46:04,151 --> 00:46:06,191
- So, what do you think?
- Aside from no body,

635
00:46:06,191 --> 00:46:09,791
no witnesses,
no evidence whatsoever
that a crime was committed,

636
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:13,551
as crackpot theory's go,
very plausible.

637
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:15,672
Are you cynical
or just apathetic?

638
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:17,512
- Did you see this murder?
- I heard it.

639
00:46:17,512 --> 00:46:20,152
You heard them fighting,
which married couples do
from time-to-time.

640
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:23,912
I heard her scream.
And then I heard him
sawing away all night.

641
00:46:23,912 --> 00:46:27,593
Residential zoning violation
and not very neighborly,

642
00:46:27,593 --> 00:46:30,033
- but hardly a capital crime.
- He was covering up a murder.

643
00:46:31,433 --> 00:46:34,312
Look. I hate to be cynical.
But, you're lying in bed,

644
00:46:34,312 --> 00:46:36,553
you can't sleep,
you're looking at the ceiling,

645
00:46:36,553 --> 00:46:39,313
- you start to imagine things...
- I didn't imagine this.

646
00:46:39,313 --> 00:46:41,033
Alison, did you hear a scream?

647
00:46:41,033 --> 00:46:43,234
Ah, well, I was downstairs.

648
00:46:43,234 --> 00:46:45,594
You telling me you didn't hear
Mrs. Thorpe scream?

649
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:48,275
No, I didn't. I'm sorry.
I might have been

650
00:46:48,275 --> 00:46:51,835
in the laundry room.
I have a monitor in there
so I can hear Jason,

651
00:46:51,835 --> 00:46:54,954
but I can't really
hear anything from outside.

652
00:46:54,954 --> 00:46:58,315
All right. No corroboration
on the blood-curdling scream.

653
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,795
Yet. I'll canvas the neighbors.

654
00:47:00,795 --> 00:47:02,635
Thanks.

655
00:47:02,635 --> 00:47:03,954
Too bad that
wasn't going last night.

656
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:06,035
We could've gone
to the video tape.

657
00:47:06,035 --> 00:47:08,994
You mind my asking,
what medication are you on?

658
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:10,595
You name it.

659
00:47:10,595 --> 00:47:13,117
Alison, he had anything
which would

660
00:47:13,117 --> 00:47:15,555
effect his judgment
or perception?

661
00:47:15,555 --> 00:47:19,196
- Sleeping pills and Valium.
- I rest my case.

662
00:47:19,196 --> 00:47:22,036
See, I think
it's possible that you

663
00:47:22,036 --> 00:47:24,195
just hallucinated
the whole scenario.

664
00:47:24,195 --> 00:47:26,276
Aren't you, at least,
gonna go and talk to them?

665
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:28,876
I mean, now don't you admit,
this is suspicious?

666
00:47:28,876 --> 00:47:31,117
It's far fetched.
But, if she's not home

667
00:47:31,117 --> 00:47:33,677
by noon tomorrow,
I'll go talk to Thorpe.

668
00:47:33,677 --> 00:47:36,597
I'll tell him we're
trying to reach his wife
to drop the charges.

669
00:47:36,597 --> 00:47:39,556
Give him an incentive
to call her and then call us.

670
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:41,637
And what if he says
he doesn't know where she is?

671
00:47:41,637 --> 00:47:43,638
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

672
00:47:43,638 --> 00:47:46,719
If I see any big sticky
patches of blood on the rug,
I'll clamp the cuffs on him.

673
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:48,838
- Very funny.
- In the meantime,

674
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:51,639
I'd take up a different hobby,
if I were you.

675
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:52,998
You, too, young lady.

676
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:54,678
Who, me?

677
00:47:54,678 --> 00:47:56,038
Yeah, you.

678
00:47:56,038 --> 00:47:58,839
You can't fool me.
You got a Jones for this, too.

679
00:47:58,839 --> 00:48:01,039
I could tell.

680
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,639
I don't know, Jason.
Maybe he's right. I mean,

681
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:09,719
maybe we're just
letting our imaginations
run wild with this thing.

682
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,601
Do you think I'm crazy?

683
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:17,520
Not crazy,
just imaginative.

684
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,480
He killed her.

685
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,399
I know it.

686
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:34,001
Man: Take it easy.
Watch it.

687
00:49:40,646 --> 00:49:42,646
Jason: Okay,
so he sold the sculpture.

688
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,406
Now what about his wife?

689
00:49:45,406 --> 00:49:47,766
I mean,
in case you hadn't noticed,
she's still missing.

690
00:49:47,766 --> 00:49:51,046
She's not missing.
She's gone. She left.

691
00:49:51,046 --> 00:49:52,846
- How do you know?
- I asked him.

692
00:49:52,846 --> 00:49:55,806
- And you just believed him?
- It was just as I figured.

693
00:49:55,806 --> 00:49:58,368
He had a deadline.
He kept pounding away all night.

694
00:49:58,368 --> 00:50:01,807
She was still pissed off
for the roughing up he gave her.

695
00:50:01,807 --> 00:50:04,008
- They had words.
- They had a lot more than that.

696
00:50:04,008 --> 00:50:06,367
Anyway, 6 a.m.,
she'd had enough.

697
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:09,368
She put some things in a bag.
She goes away for a few days

698
00:50:09,368 --> 00:50:12,488
for some peace and quiet.
And she splits.

699
00:50:12,488 --> 00:50:14,008
We don't know that.

700
00:50:14,008 --> 00:50:18,328
Last night, after our cockamamie
conversation I inquired...

701
00:50:18,328 --> 00:50:20,728
"Mrs. Thorpe left her domicile
yesterday morning

702
00:50:20,728 --> 00:50:22,928
bright and early
just like he said.

703
00:50:22,928 --> 00:50:24,369
What witnesses?

704
00:50:24,369 --> 00:50:26,488
Super for one,
car service driver for another.

705
00:50:26,488 --> 00:50:28,529
Driver took her
to the train station.

706
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:30,929
They both mentioned she had
an over-night bag with her.

707
00:50:30,929 --> 00:50:32,409
What about her jewelry
and her perfume?

708
00:50:32,409 --> 00:50:34,609
- What about 'em?
- They're still on her dresser.

709
00:50:34,609 --> 00:50:36,529
You too. I knew it.
You know,

710
00:50:36,529 --> 00:50:39,290
I take a pretty dim view
of this electronic snooping.

711
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:42,170
- Why don't you take a look?
- I don't have to.

712
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:45,090
Her jewelry and perfume
are on her burrow means
she didn't leave town?

713
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:47,851
She was in a hurry.
She left it. No big deal.

714
00:50:47,851 --> 00:50:50,690
But are you
absolutely sure it was her?

715
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,410
I called Rhode Island.
I spoke to her.

716
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:54,211
She's there.

717
00:50:56,651 --> 00:50:58,371
What about the scream?

718
00:50:58,371 --> 00:51:00,691
I canvassed
that building, this building,
the next building,

719
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:04,051
the surrounding suburbs.
Nobody else heard it.

720
00:51:04,051 --> 00:51:06,931
- That's impossible.
- Not if you dreamt it.

721
00:51:10,171 --> 00:51:11,771
I got to get back
to the real world.

722
00:51:11,771 --> 00:51:15,052
Kids, it's been fun.
Sayonara.

723
00:51:28,773 --> 00:51:30,973
I'm sorry, Jason.

724
00:51:33,573 --> 00:51:36,814
[siren in distance]

725
00:51:47,695 --> 00:51:51,094
[clicking tongue]

726
00:51:52,815 --> 00:51:55,574
I hope this getting out of bed
in the middle of the night

727
00:51:55,574 --> 00:51:57,495
isn't gonna be
a regular thing, man.

728
00:51:57,495 --> 00:51:59,135
No. Last time, I promise.

729
00:51:59,135 --> 00:52:01,215
You know, I can
always get my old job back.

730
00:52:01,215 --> 00:52:03,375
I know. I'm sorry.
Thank you.

731
00:52:09,175 --> 00:52:11,896
She like you, you know?

732
00:52:11,896 --> 00:52:13,816
Who, Alison?

733
00:52:13,816 --> 00:52:16,536
- Claudia.
- Oh, Claudia.

734
00:52:16,536 --> 00:52:19,776
Yeah, we're getting
along very well on our
project together.

735
00:52:19,776 --> 00:52:22,377
Not like that.
Like a woman, like a man.

736
00:52:22,377 --> 00:52:25,017
Ha.

737
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:26,817
Well, I only see
two problems with that.

738
00:52:26,817 --> 00:52:30,377
One, she could have
any man she wants.

739
00:52:30,377 --> 00:52:33,818
And two,
I'm damaged goods.

740
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:36,217
Contents broken
during handling and shipping.

741
00:52:36,217 --> 00:52:38,058
- Why would you want that?
- I'm telling you, man,

742
00:52:38,058 --> 00:52:39,539
when it come to a woman,

743
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:42,738
sometime waters run deeper
than you and I will ever know.

744
00:52:46,138 --> 00:52:50,139
Have you written anything
I could checkout at the library?

745
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:51,898
I don't need to write it, man.

746
00:52:51,898 --> 00:52:53,699
I know.

747
00:54:20,425 --> 00:54:22,425
It can't be.

748
00:54:24,785 --> 00:54:26,705
It can't be.

749
00:54:32,946 --> 00:54:35,506
- Well, she's back.
- Yeah, big time.

750
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:37,666
Just like I said,
they're all lovey dovey.

751
00:54:37,666 --> 00:54:40,307
But it doesn't make any sense.
They never were before.

752
00:54:40,307 --> 00:54:44,507
Ah, I don't know, Jason.
I just can't tell.

753
00:54:44,507 --> 00:54:46,505
I just don't see how
it can be her.

754
00:54:46,505 --> 00:54:47,906
No, you couldn't prove it by me.

755
00:54:47,906 --> 00:54:49,227
I didn't get a
good enough look at her.

756
00:54:49,227 --> 00:54:51,426
This one seems to be
five pounds thinner.

757
00:54:51,426 --> 00:54:54,227
Her hair's lighter.
Her mouth and chin are
a little bit different.

758
00:54:54,227 --> 00:54:56,747
That little mole
by her mouth is missing.

759
00:54:56,747 --> 00:54:58,146
Maybe she had it removed.

760
00:54:58,146 --> 00:54:59,668
Maybe this one never had it
in the first place.

761
00:54:59,668 --> 00:55:01,867
- Notice anything different?
- No.

762
00:55:01,867 --> 00:55:04,948
She's not drinking.
The other one always had
a glass in her hand

763
00:55:04,948 --> 00:55:08,108
- and a bottle by the bedside.
- You're obsessed.

764
00:55:08,108 --> 00:55:10,188
Well, maybe,
but I'm not crazy.

765
00:55:10,188 --> 00:55:11,467
What are you doing?

766
00:55:11,467 --> 00:55:13,668
I don't think
that's the real Mrs. Thorpe.

767
00:55:13,668 --> 00:55:16,228
I'm gonna find out
who she is.

768
00:55:27,629 --> 00:55:29,869
Jason: I'm gonna need
Thorpe's email address.

769
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:33,110
Claudia: Let's hope
he does some business
over the Internet.

770
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:36,549
I know he shipped
that big package out
the morning after

771
00:55:36,549 --> 00:55:40,951
- his wife disappeared.
- Well, we know the date.

772
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:42,950
We need to know
the name of the shipper.

773
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,150
Evergreen.

774
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:46,751
- How'd you know that?
- The uniform.

775
00:55:46,751 --> 00:55:49,190
They have little green markings
over the right breast pocket.

776
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:50,991
You do have an eye for detail.

777
00:55:50,991 --> 00:55:53,551
- I'll see if I can find one.
- Thanks.

778
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:54,991
Ah, yeah.

779
00:55:55,911 --> 00:55:57,431
Anything?

780
00:55:57,431 --> 00:55:59,352
He shipped that piece
up to Vermont.

781
00:55:59,352 --> 00:56:01,751
Bronze casting place
up near Burlington.

782
00:56:01,751 --> 00:56:04,592
They are very closed-mouthed
about their customers.

783
00:56:04,592 --> 00:56:07,712
They did tell me
the name of the gallery
in New York. Kimbro.

784
00:56:07,712 --> 00:56:10,072
I called, told her I was
interested in Thorpe's latest.

785
00:56:10,072 --> 00:56:11,512
- Yes?
- Already spoken for.

786
00:56:11,512 --> 00:56:13,912
Just like he told Charlie.
Gallery owner said

787
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,952
he doesn't produce a lot.
"Much in demand"

788
00:56:16,952 --> 00:56:18,992
- was the phrase she used.
- Did you get his email address?

789
00:56:18,992 --> 00:56:21,393
No luck.

790
00:56:21,393 --> 00:56:25,033
Do you really think
he killed his wife?

791
00:56:25,033 --> 00:56:27,913
I mean, deep down,
are you 100 percent on this?

792
00:56:27,913 --> 00:56:29,634
One hundred percent.

793
00:56:29,634 --> 00:56:32,073
That woman over there,
she's not Ilene Thorpe?

794
00:56:32,073 --> 00:56:33,273
No.

795
00:56:33,273 --> 00:56:35,234
Even though
Charlie checked her I.D.?

796
00:56:35,234 --> 00:56:37,154
You can fake an I.D.

797
00:56:37,154 --> 00:56:39,634
So if she's not
Ilene Thorpe...

798
00:56:39,634 --> 00:56:42,314
Then who is she?
And where is Ilene Thorpe?

799
00:56:43,594 --> 00:56:45,194
Okay.

800
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:47,754
Just checking the temperature
on your conspiracy theory.

801
00:56:47,754 --> 00:56:49,595
Have I convinced you?

802
00:56:51,115 --> 00:56:54,076
Jury's still out.
But I'm keeping an open mind.

803
00:56:54,076 --> 00:56:55,315
That's all I ask.

804
00:56:59,995 --> 00:57:01,436
And an open line.

805
00:57:01,436 --> 00:57:02,436
What?

806
00:57:05,597 --> 00:57:07,635
I've got an idea.

807
00:57:13,116 --> 00:57:15,717
Mr. Thorpe:
So these are...

808
00:57:15,717 --> 00:57:18,957
these are some of my
newer pieces.

809
00:57:18,957 --> 00:57:20,757
Claudia:
They're great.

810
00:57:20,757 --> 00:57:22,677
They're so unusual.

811
00:57:22,677 --> 00:57:25,197
But, actually,
I'm looking for larger pieces.

812
00:57:25,197 --> 00:57:27,437
- How large?
- Pieces that you could

813
00:57:27,437 --> 00:57:30,599
display in public areas,
lobby's, that kind of thing.

814
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:32,157
I just finished
something like that.

815
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:35,399
- Can I see it?
- It's not here.

816
00:57:35,399 --> 00:57:36,998
I sent it out a few days ago.

817
00:57:36,998 --> 00:57:39,678
You wouldn't have a slide,
or a photograph, something?

818
00:57:39,678 --> 00:57:41,998
- I'll get you something.
- That would be great.

819
00:57:41,998 --> 00:57:43,839
Okay.

820
00:57:46,919 --> 00:57:49,078
- Cover me.
- Okay.

821
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,960
- [door opens]
- He's coming back. Quick.

822
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,081
He's coming back
from the room.

823
00:58:20,081 --> 00:58:22,401
- This piece is interesting.
- Thank you.

824
00:58:22,401 --> 00:58:25,002
It's not available.
Sorry.

825
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:26,921
- Oh, you found it.
- Yeah.

826
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,241
- Oh, that's incredible.
- You like it?

827
00:58:29,241 --> 00:58:31,723
Oh, very much.
Can you tell me who

828
00:58:31,723 --> 00:58:35,121
commissioned this piece? I'd
love to see it in the flesh.

829
00:58:35,121 --> 00:58:37,402
You'd have
to contact my gallery.

830
00:58:37,402 --> 00:58:39,202
- "Kimbro."
- [laughing]

831
00:58:39,202 --> 00:58:41,644
- You know my work.
- Yeah.

832
00:58:41,644 --> 00:58:43,762
Like I said,
I'm a fan.

833
00:58:43,762 --> 00:58:46,203
Um, may I use your bathroom?

834
00:58:46,203 --> 00:58:48,683
Yeah, it's ah...

835
00:58:50,124 --> 00:58:51,403
Thanks.

836
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:53,083
Have fun.

837
00:58:59,404 --> 00:59:02,564
He's still in the other room.

838
00:59:04,044 --> 00:59:06,164
Okay, he walked away.

839
00:59:10,164 --> 00:59:12,484
Yeah, look there.
Look through there.

840
00:59:22,085 --> 00:59:23,565
Yeah, look through there.

841
00:59:23,565 --> 00:59:26,686
Oh, wait till you see this.

842
00:59:30,045 --> 00:59:32,366
You're okay.

843
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:50,448
He's coming back.
He's coming back.

844
00:59:50,448 --> 00:59:52,287
- Hey.
- Hey.

845
00:59:52,287 --> 00:59:55,167
Thank you so much
for showing me your work.

846
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:58,448
- I really appreciate it.
- Thanks for your interest.

847
00:59:58,448 --> 00:59:59,927
- I'll be in touch.
- Okay.

848
00:59:59,927 --> 01:00:01,048
Okay.

849
01:00:01,048 --> 01:00:03,008
- Bye.
- Bye.

850
01:00:10,689 --> 01:00:12,968
[siren in distance]

851
01:00:12,968 --> 01:00:14,769
Jason: Oh, no. Oh, no.

852
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:20,009
Damn.

853
01:00:31,891 --> 01:00:34,049
Claudia, pick up the phone.
Pick up the phone.

854
01:00:34,049 --> 01:00:36,570
He knows you've been
snooping around.

855
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:39,210
- Get out of there, quick.
- You're breaking up.

856
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:41,571
Get out of there, quick.
Quick, quick.

857
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:43,010
Claudia: Hello?

858
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:56,892
Thanks for the heads up.
I took the stairs.

859
01:00:56,892 --> 01:00:59,412
Whew! That was a close one.

860
01:00:59,412 --> 01:01:02,132
- Yeah, too close.
- No kidding.

861
01:01:02,132 --> 01:01:04,652
- Sorry, I messed up.
- Did you get his email address?

862
01:01:04,652 --> 01:01:06,253
Yes. Don't do
anything rash with it.

863
01:01:06,253 --> 01:01:08,611
- Who, me?
- You.

864
01:01:08,611 --> 01:01:11,013
- Listen. You were right.
- I was?

865
01:01:11,013 --> 01:01:13,973
Uh-huh. There is definitely a
new girl in residence over there

866
01:01:13,973 --> 01:01:15,933
and the old one
is not coming back.

867
01:01:15,933 --> 01:01:18,332
- What convinced you?
- Ilene's things have been

868
01:01:18,332 --> 01:01:20,934
put away and replaced
by some other woman's,

869
01:01:20,934 --> 01:01:23,012
and it's not the same stuff.

870
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,293
- Any sign of another name?
- No. Whoever she is,

871
01:01:25,293 --> 01:01:27,695
she's still going
by the name Ilene Thorpe

872
01:01:27,695 --> 01:01:29,373
using her I.D.,
her checkbook...

873
01:01:29,373 --> 01:01:31,654
Oh, boy. I blew it.

874
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:34,455
If I hadn't left that screen up,
he'd never have known.

875
01:01:34,455 --> 01:01:36,855
No, maybe that's good.
It might make him nervous.

876
01:01:36,855 --> 01:01:40,215
And if he gets nervous,
he might make a big mistake.

877
01:01:40,215 --> 01:01:41,575
What now?

878
01:01:41,575 --> 01:01:45,214
Well, since
he's already sweating...

879
01:01:45,214 --> 01:01:47,775
why don't we turn up the heat?

880

And you won't
get away with it."

885
01:02:00,896 --> 01:02:03,816
- "Send."
- [computer beeps]

886
01:02:03,816 --> 01:02:06,416

888
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:38,263
Come on, turn around.

889
01:03:38,263 --> 01:03:40,663
Turn around
and go to the computer.

890
01:03:47,263 --> 01:03:49,664
Come on.

891
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:55,823
That's it.
Boot it up.

892
01:04:02,824 --> 01:04:04,664
Okay.

893
01:04:09,665 --> 01:04:13,506
Come on.
Read your mail.

894
01:04:23,585 --> 01:04:25,026
All right.

895
01:04:25,026 --> 01:04:27,227
That's it.

896
01:05:13,908 --> 01:05:17,309
All right.
Send me something back.

897
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:24,390
Bring up email.

898
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:25,990
Read.

899
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:29,550
What do I want?

900
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:32,430
What do I want?

901
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:36,951
Email to Handrasp.

Turn off the lights!

01:06:30,794 --> 01:06:33,234
Sorry. Sorry.
Are you okay?

911
01:06:33,234 --> 01:06:36,034
Yes.
What is it?

912
01:06:39,234 --> 01:06:42,395
I just came up
to see if you wanted me
to wash your hair.

913
01:06:42,395 --> 01:06:44,475
- No, thank you.
- Okay.

914
01:06:44,475 --> 01:06:46,395
Um, do you want me
to leave these off?

915
01:06:46,395 --> 01:06:48,956
- Yes, please.
- All right. Sorry.

916
01:07:30,918 --> 01:07:33,199
- Dial Charlie Moore.

- [phone ringing]
- Woman: Yes?

918
01:07:35,198 --> 01:07:37,959
Mrs. Moore, it's Jason Kemp.
Is Charlie there?

919
01:07:37,959 --> 01:07:41,558
He's working a case.
If you like, I can page him.

920
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:45,759
Tell him that the boy
isn't crying wolf this time.
The wolf's at the door.

921
01:07:45,759 --> 01:07:48,520
And have him call me
the minute he comes in.

922
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,839
- I'll be up.
- Okay, I'll tell him.

923
01:07:50,839 --> 01:07:52,159
Thank you.

Hi, this is Claudia.

927
01:07:58,801 --> 01:08:00,960
I'm not here right now.
You know what to do.

- [beep]
- Claudia. Hi, it's Jason.

929
01:08:03,161 --> 01:08:06,641
Um, just wanted to say
that I've had dinner already,

930
01:08:06,641 --> 01:08:08,241
so, no need to drop by.

931
01:08:08,241 --> 01:08:11,361
And, um, um,
I'll see you in the morning.

932

Okay? Bye.

get over here immediately.

- Disconnect.
- Intercom on.

- Alison?
- Yes.

941
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:35,162
Would you please lock
the outside door?

942
01:08:35,162 --> 01:08:36,643
Are you sure?

943
01:08:36,643 --> 01:08:39,643
Just lock the door now.
Would you please?

944
01:08:39,643 --> 01:08:42,403
- Okay.
- Thank you.

945
01:09:26,807 --> 01:09:28,966
Oh, my God.
You scared me this time.

946
01:09:28,966 --> 01:09:31,366
- I'm sorry.
- Is there something wrong?

947
01:09:31,366 --> 01:09:33,927
Because you're acting
really weird.

948
01:09:33,927 --> 01:09:36,367
I'm sorry, but I didn't mean
to take it out on you.

949
01:09:36,367 --> 01:09:37,847
It's all right.

950
01:09:37,847 --> 01:09:40,287
Is the front door locked,
the elevator door locked...

951
01:09:40,287 --> 01:09:44,167
- It's all locked.
- Okay. Good.

952
01:09:44,167 --> 01:09:47,007
Well, I think I'll settle in
and watch a little TV.

953
01:09:47,007 --> 01:09:48,768
I'll be downstairs,
if you need me.

954
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:53,808
If you want to,
you could, ah, come on up
and keep me company.

955
01:09:53,808 --> 01:09:55,288
Okay.

956
01:09:55,288 --> 01:09:57,728
I'll just get my charts.
I'll be right back.

957
01:09:57,728 --> 01:09:59,849
And a couple of
Valium for me, too.

958
01:09:59,849 --> 01:10:01,728
I'm just kidding.

[On TV] Knocks it
into right field and
Hall's gonna be at 2nd

- You know, Frank,

961
01:10:18,849 --> 01:10:21,810
I think that was a...

01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:23,330
[elevator bell dings]

963
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:25,131
Hey, Alison.

964
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:30,011
Antonio?
Come on in and watch the game.

965
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:33,451
We're up by two
on the coast.

966
01:10:41,692 --> 01:10:44,771
- Who the hell are you?
- You know who I am.

967
01:10:44,771 --> 01:10:46,651
You've been spying on me.

968
01:10:46,651 --> 01:10:49,652
You've even sent me those
charming emails this evening.

969
01:10:49,652 --> 01:10:51,972
No, you're mistaken.
It wasn't' me.

970
01:10:51,972 --> 01:10:54,612
I'll tell you what.
I'll check your email directory.

971
01:10:54,612 --> 01:10:56,893
If I'm not on it,
I'll go home.

972
01:10:56,893 --> 01:10:59,172
- No harm done.
- How did you get in here?

973
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:01,052
I walked in.
How about you?

974
01:11:01,052 --> 01:11:02,773
The elevator door was locked.

975
01:11:02,773 --> 01:11:04,773
Yeah.

976
01:11:04,773 --> 01:11:08,133
I was already inside.

977
01:11:08,133 --> 01:11:12,333
Alison, dial 911.
Alison, 911, now!

978
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:15,693
Alison, dial 911.
Alison?

979
01:11:15,693 --> 01:11:17,333
I don't think
she can hear you.

980
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:20,894
- What did you do to her?
- Never you mind.

981
01:11:20,894 --> 01:11:22,734
Look at yourself.

982
01:11:22,734 --> 01:11:25,375
Sitting at that window

983
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:27,735
day in and day out...

984
01:11:27,735 --> 01:11:30,894
spying on people.

985
01:11:30,894 --> 01:11:34,615
How terribly,
terribly small.

986
01:11:35,694 --> 01:11:38,095
Can you actually see anything?

987
01:11:40,615 --> 01:11:42,495
I don't think so.

988
01:11:44,016 --> 01:11:45,697
I told her,

989
01:11:45,697 --> 01:11:49,776
if he'd seen something,
why did he wait until now?

990
01:11:49,776 --> 01:11:52,336
But he could still
cause trouble, she said,

991
01:11:52,336 --> 01:11:54,816
get the cops snooping around.

992
01:11:54,816 --> 01:11:57,136
She's got a point there.

993
01:11:57,136 --> 01:11:58,576
Hey!

994
01:11:58,576 --> 01:12:00,976
So...

995
01:12:00,976 --> 01:12:05,218
I need your password
so I can retrieve those emails.

996
01:12:07,376 --> 01:12:08,937
Hand it over.

997
01:12:08,937 --> 01:12:11,417
I don't remember it.

998
01:12:11,417 --> 01:12:13,818
Too bad.

999
01:12:15,619 --> 01:12:18,538
That little nurse, Alison...

1000
01:12:20,259 --> 01:12:22,738
Is it true
what they say about nurses?

1001
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:26,218
- Is it?
- What did you do to her?

1002
01:12:26,218 --> 01:12:29,259
Little methylene chloride.
She'll wakeup with a headache.

1003
01:12:29,259 --> 01:12:32,458
You wanna cooperate with me,
that's all she'll have.

1004
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:39,620
"Achilles."

1005
01:12:41,579 --> 01:12:43,699
Achilles.

1006
01:12:43,699 --> 01:12:45,619
How very pompous.

1007
01:12:45,619 --> 01:12:47,380
Don't you hurt her.

1008
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:51,580
For somebody that,
I'm sure, spends most of
their time thinking,

1009
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:54,060
you're not too smart,
are you?

1010
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:56,540
Of course I won't hurt her.

1011
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:58,420
No one will ever know
I was even here.

1012
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,501
That's the point.
No one will know,

1013
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:03,501
and everyone will be
a lot better off without you.

1014
01:13:03,501 --> 01:13:05,181
Don't you think?

1015
01:13:05,181 --> 01:13:07,541
Honestly?

1016
01:13:10,221 --> 01:13:11,861
Yeah.

1017
01:13:16,301 --> 01:13:20,583
That looks like it could just
fall apart right there.

1018
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:24,342
You'd think they'd come up
with a better design, don't you?

1019
01:13:27,262 --> 01:13:29,704
Too easy to fix.

1020
01:13:32,223 --> 01:13:33,863
Oh.

1021
01:13:40,463 --> 01:13:43,503
On the other hand...

1022
01:13:43,503 --> 01:13:46,664
cracks in the tubing...

1023
01:13:46,664 --> 01:13:49,264
so hard...

1024
01:13:49,264 --> 01:13:50,825
to find.

1025
01:13:52,064 --> 01:13:54,144
[monitor sounding]

1026
01:13:56,504 --> 01:13:59,985
Enjoy the rest of the game.

1027
01:13:59,985 --> 01:14:02,025
I'll just turn up the volume.

1028
01:14:04,785 --> 01:14:08,265
I wouldn't want
somebody to walk in...

1029
01:14:08,265 --> 01:14:11,306
hearing you gasping
like a fish, eh?

1030
01:14:20,387 --> 01:14:21,986
I'll let you
get some rest now.

1031
01:14:21,986 --> 01:14:25,067
I'll try and
visit you again soon.

1032
01:14:25,067 --> 01:14:27,307
Okay.

1033
01:14:27,307 --> 01:14:28,907
Bye.

1034
01:14:45,028 --> 01:14:46,828
Achilles.

1035
01:14:48,388 --> 01:14:50,508
Change password.

1036
01:14:50,508 --> 01:14:52,548
- [computer beeping]
- to Icarus.

1037
01:14:54,268 --> 01:14:55,989
Achilles.

1038
01:14:58,588 --> 01:15:00,229
Icarus.

1039
01:15:02,349 --> 01:15:04,430
Bring lift to three.

1040
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:08,109
Lock downstairs doors.

1041
01:15:08,109 --> 01:15:12,149
[alarm sounding]

1042
01:15:17,309 --> 01:15:18,870
Ahhh!

1043
01:16:07,512 --> 01:16:10,153
[monitor beeping]

1044
01:16:35,636 --> 01:16:38,636
Let's stop this
running around, shall we?

1045
01:16:42,435 --> 01:16:43,995
So you can
breathe on your own.

1046
01:16:43,995 --> 01:16:46,116
Ha. Nice one.

1047
01:16:47,995 --> 01:16:50,037
I'll get to the point.

1048
01:16:50,037 --> 01:16:51,717
You're gonna die.

1049
01:16:53,676 --> 01:16:57,596
If you give me the password,
no one else will get hurt.

1050
01:16:57,596 --> 01:16:59,798
If you don't,

1051
01:16:59,798 --> 01:17:02,117
I'm going to kill her,

1052
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:05,157
I'm gonna burn
this place to the ground,

1053
01:17:05,157 --> 01:17:06,917
and you're gonna watch.

1054
01:17:08,037 --> 01:17:11,638
You like watching things,
don't ya?

1055
01:17:11,638 --> 01:17:13,838
Go to hell.

1056
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:21,598
Antonio: Jason!
Jason, is that you, man?

1057
01:17:21,598 --> 01:17:23,998
[monitor beeping rapidly]

1058
01:17:23,998 --> 01:17:27,320
Man, what...?
Pop-off where?

1059
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,918
- [muttering]
- Bang?

1060
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,280
Let him go, Thorpe.
Let him go!

1061
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,641
Back off!
Back off!

1062
01:17:51,641 --> 01:17:54,240
On your face.
Turn over.

1063
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:57,521
All right, man.
Okay. Here it is.

1064
01:17:57,521 --> 01:17:59,801
Put your hands
behind your back.

1065
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:02,202
- Both of them.
- Just take it easy.

1066
01:18:02,202 --> 01:18:04,881
Here it is.
I got it.

1067
01:18:06,802 --> 01:18:08,401
Ah, there you go.

1068
01:18:08,401 --> 01:18:09,761
You'll be all right now.

1069
01:18:13,362 --> 01:18:14,362
Antonio: She all right.

1070
01:18:15,682 --> 01:18:18,122
Well, I guess
you didn't dream it.

1071
01:18:18,122 --> 01:18:19,443
What do you know.

1072
01:18:24,603 --> 01:18:27,043
[background conversation]

1073
01:18:27,043 --> 01:18:29,602
Very fancy.

1074
01:18:29,602 --> 01:18:31,924
Pretty nice looking building.

1075
01:18:31,924 --> 01:18:33,363
For a glass Silo.

1076
01:18:33,363 --> 01:18:36,043
You know, you really are
a Philistine, you know that?

1077
01:18:36,043 --> 01:18:38,082
Actually,
I do know that.

1078
01:18:38,082 --> 01:18:41,524
- How's jury selection going?
- This is a pretty thin case.

1079
01:18:41,524 --> 01:18:43,924
No confession. No corpse.
Maybe no crime.

1080
01:18:43,924 --> 01:18:46,684
- What about the sister?
- She confessed, all right.

1081
01:18:46,684 --> 01:18:48,244
She did?

1082
01:18:48,244 --> 01:18:50,524
To being the
missing woman's sister,
and having an affair

1083
01:18:50,524 --> 01:18:52,286
with her brother-in-law,
which may be a crime...

1084
01:18:52,286 --> 01:18:54,604
But she didn't
confess to murder?

1085
01:18:54,604 --> 01:18:57,845
Why would she confess to murder?
She does that, it's all over.

1086
01:18:57,845 --> 01:19:01,205
Why does anyone
ever confess to murder?
There's no upside.

1087
01:19:01,205 --> 01:19:04,485
No, killers only give
it up on TV to better
looking cops than me.

1088
01:19:04,485 --> 01:19:06,606
She was murdered.
There is no doubt about that.

1089
01:19:06,606 --> 01:19:08,765
- Plenty of doubt.
- What about the perfume?

1090
01:19:08,765 --> 01:19:11,606
- The jewelry?
- Cornerstone of my case.

1091
01:19:11,606 --> 01:19:15,246
- Are they just gonna walk?
- Ah, not exactly. No.

1092
01:19:15,246 --> 01:19:18,366
We've got her for
impersonating her sister.

1093
01:19:18,366 --> 01:19:20,887
She kited some checks.
The fraud charges may stick.

1094
01:19:20,887 --> 01:19:22,647
- Big deal.
- And...

1095
01:19:22,647 --> 01:19:25,687
we got him for assault.
Attempted murder on you.

1096
01:19:25,687 --> 01:19:28,127
No, they are gonna do some time.
But for the murder of

1097
01:19:28,127 --> 01:19:31,727
- Mrs. Thorpe, I don't think so.
- I don't understand why

1098
01:19:31,727 --> 01:19:34,647
you can't find the bronze.
'Cause you find the bronze,

1099
01:19:34,647 --> 01:19:37,528
you're gonna find her.
I think that he stuffed her body

1100
01:19:37,528 --> 01:19:41,608
inside it, and shipped it out
right under our noses.

1101
01:19:41,608 --> 01:19:42,849
Jimmy Hoffa
and the Meadowlands.

1102
01:19:42,849 --> 01:19:44,367
Probably where he got the idea.

1103
01:19:44,367 --> 01:19:48,088
Jimmy Hoffa was never found,
let me remind you.

1104
01:19:48,088 --> 01:19:50,689
There you are.
We're ready downstairs.

1105
01:19:50,689 --> 01:19:52,209
Okay. You ready?

1106
01:19:52,209 --> 01:19:55,048
Let me have another sip.

1107
01:19:55,048 --> 01:19:56,610
Okay.

1108
01:19:56,610 --> 01:19:59,209
Franklin: You all
know my partner Jason Kemp,

1109
01:19:59,209 --> 01:20:02,690
who designed
this spectacular building
and saw it through

1110
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:05,329
despite enormous odds
and difficulties.

1111
01:20:05,329 --> 01:20:08,809
I'd like him to come over here
and do the honors. Jason.

1112
01:20:08,809 --> 01:20:11,410
[applause]

1113
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:18,850
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Franklin.

1114
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:20,890
And thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

1115
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:23,250
This is really a
wonderful day for me.

1116
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:25,251
A day I often thought
would never come.

1117
01:20:25,251 --> 01:20:27,771
First, I need to thank
some very special friends.

1118
01:20:27,771 --> 01:20:31,531
My right-hand man
and resident philosopher,
Antonio Fredericks.

1119
01:20:31,531 --> 01:20:36,132
My head nurse, Alison Rothman
is here with us today.

1120
01:20:36,132 --> 01:20:40,452
And especially my partner,
my, ah, very talented partner,

1121
01:20:40,452 --> 01:20:43,412
Claudia Henderson.

1122
01:20:43,412 --> 01:20:45,972
Without all of them
and their support,

1123
01:20:45,972 --> 01:20:48,492
I literally
wouldn't be here today.

1124
01:20:48,492 --> 01:20:50,693
[applause]

1125
01:20:54,452 --> 01:20:57,854
Now I know that it's
customary on these occasions

1126
01:20:57,854 --> 01:21:00,133
for the architect
to cut the ribbon.

1127
01:21:00,133 --> 01:21:03,174
Well, that's not really
possible right now.

1128
01:21:03,174 --> 01:21:06,814
Although, I hope that
someday soon it will be.

1129
01:21:06,814 --> 01:21:10,374
Well actually,
I could cut it with my teeth.
Instead, I'd like to ask

1130
01:21:10,374 --> 01:21:13,613
the one who was really
indispensable on this project,

1131
01:21:13,613 --> 01:21:16,174
to come up and do the honors.

1132
01:21:16,174 --> 01:21:18,175
Claudia Henderson.
Claudia.

1133
01:21:18,175 --> 01:21:20,494
[applause]

1134
01:21:20,494 --> 01:21:23,775
Thank you, Mister Mayor.
Thank you, Jason.

1135
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:29,335
Yeah.

1136
01:21:51,937 --> 01:21:54,416
Woolrich commissioned
the piece from Thorpe.

1137
01:21:54,416 --> 01:21:56,618
It's been sitting
in our lobby all this time.

1138
01:21:56,618 --> 01:21:58,656
How could we
not have known that?

1139
01:21:58,656 --> 01:22:01,177
Remember that meeting
you didn't go to on Lobby Art?

1140
01:22:01,177 --> 01:22:05,418
Woolrich told me that he
commissioned some sculptures
from prominent local artists.

1141
01:22:05,418 --> 01:22:07,858
That you'd approved
the sketches. And it was
a done deal.

1142
01:22:07,858 --> 01:22:10,257
They never told me
the names of the artists.

1143
01:22:10,257 --> 01:22:11,819
I never approved any sketches.

1144
01:22:11,819 --> 01:22:14,018
It was the day
of your accident.

1145
01:22:14,018 --> 01:22:15,499
That's why I don't remember.

1146
01:22:15,499 --> 01:22:18,139
- Good morning.
- Hi, Charlie.

1147
01:22:18,139 --> 01:22:19,979
I just heard from the lab.

1148
01:22:19,979 --> 01:22:22,500
What were the results
of the X-rays?

1149
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,059
- Negative.
- Are you sure?

1150
01:22:25,059 --> 01:22:27,140
She ain't in there.
We're back to square one.

1151
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:29,139
Attempted murder
and Check kiting.

1152
01:22:29,139 --> 01:22:31,100
We struck out, kids.

1153
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:33,380
See you in court.

1154
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:38,220
I'm sorry, Jason.

1155
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:41,421
I'm gonna take one last look
at the scene of the crime.

1156
01:22:41,421 --> 01:22:43,780
Sure. Knock yourself out.

1157
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:52,380
- Dead here during the day.
- I keep telling you.

1158
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:54,420
Nighttime is the right time.

1159
01:23:33,024 --> 01:23:35,144
Has the late show started yet?

1160
01:23:35,144 --> 01:23:36,224
What?

1161
01:23:36,224 --> 01:23:39,064
The...X-rated version?

1162
01:23:39,064 --> 01:23:40,984
What do you mean?

1163
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:46,744
I think you know
very well what I mean.

1164
01:23:56,265 --> 01:23:58,466
Are you sure
you want to do this?

1165
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:00,946
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.

1166
01:24:01,986 --> 01:24:03,746
You're incredible.

1167
01:24:04,985 --> 01:24:07,546
You know, it always
won't be like this.

1168
01:24:07,546 --> 01:24:09,385
You know, um...

1169
01:24:09,385 --> 01:24:13,667
Right now I can't,
you know? But...

1170
01:24:13,667 --> 01:24:16,026
I'm gonna be on
my feet again in a few years.

1171
01:24:16,026 --> 01:24:17,986
I believe that.

1172
01:24:17,986 --> 01:24:20,226
- It doesn't matter.
- In the meantime...

1173
01:24:20,226 --> 01:24:22,067
In the meantime,

1174
01:24:22,067 --> 01:24:24,228
we're just
gonna have to be...

1175
01:24:24,228 --> 01:24:25,587
creative.
