1
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,037
I'm Special Investigative Agent Kessel...

2
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:41,206
...in charge of the FBI and
Department of Justice's Joint Task Force...

3
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,333
...on deranged and violent criminals.

4
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,878
In the most extreme,
brutal and violent cases...

5
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,797
...traditional forensic investigation
can be inadequate.

6
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,466
In these instances...

7
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:54,344
...to hunt down these most vicious
and elusive killers and psychopaths...

8
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,806
...we solicit the assistance of civilians
with extraordinary gifts.

9
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,683
Catherine Deane was one of them.

10
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,153
Now there's another.

11
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,494
Commander Skylar, reporting to 217.

12
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,080
I repeat, 2-1-7. Do you copy?

13
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,250
Roger. Now here we go, surrounding...

14
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,178
Turning around. It should be above you.

15
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,542
It looks like some kind of abandoned mill.

16
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,010
It has a stone wall around it.

17
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,555
Ramparts.

18
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,976
Please, what is our heading?

19
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,024
Where is this place?

20
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,157
This is Commander Skylar.
We are looking for an abandoned mill.

21
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,494
Something with rock, stone,
a thick structure.

22
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,250
Heading is confirmed, over.

23
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:52,921
Airship is already in the area.
Go, go, go.

24
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,220
I need a confirmation on this.

25
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,186
Keep heading on towards 217...
- I see it.

26
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,314
It should be on the down,
95 out of the red...

27
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,274
The paralysis is wearing off.

28
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:23,911
Roger. We're heading towards the
deck. We're coming up on the deck...

29
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,330
I want all teams ready to go
the second we arrive.

30
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,916
All teams ready to go on arrival.

31
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,628
Roger that. Airship 1. We're awaiting...

32
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,172
Where are they?

33
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,185
Please. Help me.
Please, please. I beg of you.

34
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,696
Her last memory is of being in the box.
She can't see anything.

35
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,615
Neither can I.

36
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,624
Wait.

37
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,919
- His bracelet.
- No.

38
00:04:56,087 --> 00:05:00,090
I could go into his conscious mind.
I could see what he's seeing right now.

39
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,842
- No.
- Yes.

40
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,305
Where is she?

41
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,141
- You know what's going on down there.
- I'll be safe.

42
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,019
Give me something, or we're going in.

43
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,395
You sure about this, Maya?

44
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,189
Yeah.

45
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,526
Okay.

46
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,361
We hold for Maya.

47
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,904
All right.

48
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,646
Heart or the mind?

49
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,231
The eternal question.

50
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,819
The human body can endure a lot.

51
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,572
Eliminate the heart or the brain...

52
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,991
...not too much left.

53
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,598
Is that you, Maya?

54
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,017
Go!

55
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,062
He knows we're here.

56
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,981
Skylar, go.

57
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,317
Go, go, go.

58
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,657
Tell me what you see.

59
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,289
Tell me you got this bastard.

60
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,172
Pack it up. We're out of here.

61
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,010
Now he's gone, and she's dead.

62
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,137
That's good work, agent.

63
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,480
Damn it, Maya.
Why can't you describe this guy?

64
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,690
Because I can't.

65
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,651
I can't.

66
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,277
All right.

67
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,905
It's all right.

68
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,617
- It's not your fault.
- No, of course it isn't.

69
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,578
The next girl he kills
won't be your fault either.

70
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,797
Don't worry, Maya girl.
We'll meet again.

71
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,805
Thanks.

72
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,477
Victoria Austin.

73
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,562
Local girl.

74
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,773
The same marks as the body last month,
right?

75
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,358
Yeah. And it's just a hunch...

76
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,653
...but I'm guessing
the same cause of death too.

77
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:59,866
I haven't been doing this very long,
but I've never seen anything like this. God.

78
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,495
Same marks, same age, same body type.
Fellows...

79
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,747
Looks like we got a serial killer.

80
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,916
Serial killer?

81
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,335
She'll be my first one.

82
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,629
Had a lot of those out in L.A.

83
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,631
Worked out good for their coroner.

84
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,384
He wrote a few books, didn't he?
Hey, maybe I could do...

85
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,677
Hey, doc.

86
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,554
- Give me a break, will you?
- Guess this makes this federal?

87
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,306
Sheriff.

88
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,269
A girl's gone missing
over at the university.

89
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,896
Sheriff...

90
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,565
...it's your niece.

91
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,401
Penelope.

92
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,620
So how does this work?

93
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,458
I need an object
that has a link to his mind.

94
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,293
The more he handled it, the better.

95
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,048
And then you'll be able to see my Billy?

96
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,717
See into his mind?

97
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,554
I can't see into his conscious mind,
but I can look through his memories.

98
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,473
And, hopefully, that'll lead us to him.

99
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,314
I...

100
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,276
I can't thank you enough.

101
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,157
Did you bring an object with you today?

102
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,325
Yes.

103
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,173
Here's my boy.

104
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,509
Billy.

105
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,205
Maya.

106
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,040
It's been a while.

107
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,549
What do you want, Kessel?

108
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,470
I need your help.

109
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,723
I don't work for the FBI anymore.

110
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,184
- Much more important work going on here.
Skylar.

111
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,855
Why now?

112
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,732
- This could be anyone.
It's the Cusp.

113
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,318
He's back.

114
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,075
- I can't.
- Come on, Maya.

115
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,245
We got closer to him a year ago
than we've ever been.

116
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,705
- Because of you.
No.

117
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,416
Because of me...

118
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,252
...Sarah Miller's dead.

119
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,591
I've spent the last three years of my life
chasing this guy.

120
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,218
It's over.

121
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,928
That's it.

122
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,430
And now he's back.

123
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,308
Put it behind me.

124
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,522
Looks like you've done a great job
putting him behind you.

125
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,240
He's taken a new victim.

126
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,705
Yeah.

127
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,874
It was about 24 hours ago.

128
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,254
So you know exactly...

129
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,464
...what he's doing to her...

130
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,091
...right now.

131
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,106
Anybody.

132
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,027
Please, help me!

133
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,863
Please!

134
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,826
Please, I'll do anything.
I'll...

135
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,287
Please, I promise I won't say anything.

136
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,706
I won't tell anybody where you are.
I won't te...

137
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:21,252
I'm going to make you beg for
death. But first...

138
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,171
...I'm gonna kill you.

139
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,256
Oh, God.

140
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,928
Please.

141
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,387
Maybe for the last time.

142
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,682
I'll help you get as many women
as you want if you let me free.

143
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,686
No, no. Please, please.
Don't do this. I wanna live.

144
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,856
Just kill me.

145
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,691
I wanna die.

146
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,109
Hmm.

147
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,236
Tell my family I love them.

148
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,698
Tell her family. Why would she want me
around her family?

149
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,492
That wasn't very well thought out.

150
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,036
Don't do it.

151
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:59,874
Don't do it. I'm begging you.
Don't do this.

152
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,382
All the girls have something to say.

153
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,354
What are you do...? What are you...?

154
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,937
Oh, God. Oh, God.

155
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,704
I don't know.

156
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:24,459
I don't get it. No place to hide,
no other cars to hide behind.

157
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,210
I got nothing. What about you?

158
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,796
We've been over this spot
with a fine-toothed comb.

159
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:32,133
The boyfriend said she parked her car here,
but there's nothing.

160
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,010
Maybe the boyfriend lied?

161
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,220
Maybe he did. I don't know.

162
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,599
We just got a call. A conductor
with the Utah and Western Railroad...

163
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,310
...says he saw an '87 Acura Legend,
navy blue...

164
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,646
...pulled over by the locomotive shop
the night Penelope disappeared.

165
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,899
All right. Come on, let's go.

166
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,361
Find anything?

167
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,821
Yeah.

168
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:58,159
Tire marks are consistent
with a 1987 navy-blue Acura Legend.

169
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,245
- Maybe she stopped to pick up a hitchhiker.
- I doubt it.

170
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,331
Take a look around,
see what you can find.

171
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,749
- Yeah.
Did you hear that?

172
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,419
He can tell the color of a vehicle
just from a simple tire track.

173
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,838
Guess you're not the only one
that can read minds.

174
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,092
The conductor saw the car parked
here the night she was abducted.

175
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,512
- You must be FBI.
- That's right.

176
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,808
Well, looks like she was able
to drive away.

177
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,519
Yeah, so?

178
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,273
So no flat tires, no oil leaks.

179
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,026
- No car trouble, right?
- Again, so what?

180
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,113
What's an 18-year-old doing
parking here in the middle of night?

181
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,031
She got pulled over?

182
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,034
- And who pulls people over?
- Law enforcement.

183
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,703
Oh. Exactly.

184
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,540
We always knew the Cusp
had medical experience...

185
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,334
...considering his success
in bringing his victims back.

186
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,128
Personally...

187
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,504
...I think it's a cop.

188
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,589
You know,
he knows our procedure too well.

189
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,551
He knows what we look for.
Hell, even...

190
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,720
...leaves things for us to find
to throw us off.

191
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,722
To me, that says law enforcement.

192
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,226
That's a pretty good theory there, agent.

193
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,980
Yeah, that's why I'm considering
all local law enforcement suspects.

194
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,360
Well, what do we have here? Boot print.

195
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,904
About the same shape as yours.

196
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,031
About the same size too. Ahem.

197
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,742
But you haven't been down here yet,
so...

198
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,787
- Or you've been here before?
- Heh-heh.

199
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,874
That's some pretty amazing
detective work there.

200
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:33,796
Yeah, looks about a size 11 cowboy boot.
Most likely made by Dicks.

201
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,424
Probably only 100,000 of those
in the state alone.

202
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,925
Thanks to your observation...

203
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,596
...looks like we can narrow our suspect pool
down to about half the state.

204
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,766
Understand my reservation with local
authorities poking through my crime scene?

205
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,394
Your crime scene? This is my niece.

206
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,647
Well, if it's the Cusp, then it's federal.

207
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:58,362
Look, I don't wanna bust your balls, sheriff,
but from here on out, get behind the tape.

208
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,116
- Heh. Yeah, right.
- No, I'm quite serious.

209
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,453
You know,
let me talk to you for a second.

210
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,880
I don't wanna bust your balls either.
Let me tell you how it's done here.

211
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,925
All right, you may think
we're a bunch of backward-ass cops...

212
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,552
...whose only talent
is spitting chewing tobacco.

213
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,430
I've been doing this job for 10 years.

214
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:28,309
I like to keep it simple.
That way, we don't get all twisted up...

215
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,727
...about who's in charge.

216
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,978
Oh.

217
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,148
I figured maybe you and I,
we could work together on this...

218
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,983
...don't you think?
- Uhn!

219
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,820
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

220
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,949
I'm glad we could see eye to eye.

221
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,828
Sheriff Harris? Hi.

222
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,332
So you read minds, huh?

223
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,834
They teach you that stuff
at the FBI Academy?

224
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:58,339
No, they don't. I got that on my own.

225
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,425
- They found something over here.
- All right. I'm sorry, Maya.

226
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,469
- This is Duncan, one of my deputies.
- Hi.

227
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,763
Come on, let's go check it out.

228
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,934
Could be a piece of the victim's shirt.

229
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,936
What's this here?

230
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,358
- That's too short to be Penelope's hair.
- I'll run it for some DNA.

231
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,443
Yeah, why don't you do that?

232
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,071
I think the Cusp finally slipped up.

233
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,698
Hey.

234
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:29,078
We might be able
to get something off of this.

235
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,066
You guys got a psychic
in the FBI now, huh?

236
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,737
Now, she's not just a psychic.
She's got a unique perspective on the Cusp.

237
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,739
She was one of his first victims.

238
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:05,990
He killed her six times.

239
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,743
She's the only one
who survived being taken by the Cusp.

240
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,328
Really?

241
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,914
So now what? She reads minds,
she channels energy, what's the story?

242
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,251
It seems like death causes the brain
to emit certain endorphins...

243
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,962
...kind of like having
a near-death experience.

244
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,675
So dying and coming back six times
flooded Maya's brain with these endorphins.

245
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:29,388
And it awoke part of her mind
that lies dormant in most people.

246
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,767
That's great.
Took an already traumatized woman...

247
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,894
...convinced her she's a psychic.
Nice job.

248
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,021
No, she came to us.

249
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,606
Watch.

250
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,233
She can be pretty convincing.

251
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,666
This is neurotoxin.

252
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,878
What it does is
it causes all the muscles in the body...

253
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:46,006
...to seize at once.

254
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,972
Oh, almost forgot.

255
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,272
You better hope I die this time.

256
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,482
Why is that?

257
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,694
Because if I don't...

258
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,239
...I'm gonna kill you.

259
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,774
Oh!

260
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:52,072
Here. Let me take your pulse.
It's okay. I used to be an EMT.

261
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,993
What happened?

262
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:03,083
Pulse seems fine. Heart rate's normal.

263
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,960
I don't know.

264
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:09,798
- Must have been a flashback.
- I wish you hadn't taken these off, Maya.

265
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,383
Why?

266
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:15,262
- I mean, what are these things all about?
- Electro IDs help keep her safe.

267
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,725
In other words...

268
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,186
...if I die in his mind, I die in real life.

269
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,524
- You don't really think she can read minds?
No.

270
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,401
She might have died six times,
and I'm sorry about that.

271
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,570
But I don't think it gave her magic powers.

272
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:36,617
How did you get away from the Cusp?

273
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,245
I mean, if it's okay to ask.

274
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,419
When he brought me back to life
the sixth time...

275
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:52,299
...my pulse was so weak,
he took me for dead.

276
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,718
Dumped me in an alley.

277
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:01,016
Still better than getting my heart cut out.

278
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:08,107
Can't think of a lot of gals
that could bounce back from that one. Hah.

279
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,611
You know what, do me a favor.
Why don't you wait outside, all right?

280
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,655
Sorry.

281
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,073
Sorry...

282
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,287
Kessel.

283
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,248
I don't understand.
Why am I seeing myself?

284
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,292
Doesn't make any sense.

285
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,087
It would have to be that this is,
you...

286
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,218
Oh, my God.

287
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,810
This is a piece of the clothing
I had on when he had me.

288
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,813
Maya, he's taunting you.
You're way too close to this thing.

289
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,191
He knew.

290
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,029
He knew as soon as he resurfaced
that I'd come for him.

291
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,992
He knows I have to get into his mind.
To get Penelope, he knows.

292
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,203
- No. Remember what happened last time?
- I have to. There's no time.

293
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,080
Look, Maya, that's it.

294
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:08,959
It's over. We're gonna wait
for the DNA test on the hair.

295
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,379
Lab called.
We should have results soon.

296
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,136
Fine.

297
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,851
Hey, why don't you girls hang tight?
Keep her company.

298
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,145
I'll let you know what we find.

299
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,543
So...

300
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,754
...what you drawing?

301
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,011
Not much.

302
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:05,974
When I go into a trance,
I can see the crime...

303
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,228
...where it took place,
bunch of other details.

304
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,271
I can even see the Cusp...

305
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,440
...but I can't see his face.

306
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,778
Great. Great.

307
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,279
I'm not a fake, Harris.

308
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,615
I'm not crazy.

309
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,545
All right.

310
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:42,428
Let's just say
that you could go into people's minds.

311
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,806
- Tell me how it works.
- Let me see your ring.

312
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,309
- Mm.
- My ring?

313
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,396
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

314
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,361
All right. Here you go.

315
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,544
You crashed.

316
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,298
A helicopter.

317
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,883
Yeah.

318
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,179
Afghanistan.

319
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,306
The Cobra was shot down.

320
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,936
That's classified information.

321
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,443
I can save your niece, Harris.

322
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,281
All right.

323
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,787
How about this?

324
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,637
Here goes.

325
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:40,087
Today, we are going to be talking about...

326
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,421
...electricity.

327
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,925
Please, no more. No more.

328
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:49,555
Do you know the entire body
functions on electrical charges?

329
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,266
It's really amazing, if you think about it.

330
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:56,770
If the heart shuts down, a single
electrical charge can get it going again.

331
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:01,441
Please. Please, I can't take anymore.

332
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,860
But...

333
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:08,782
...if you administer that same charge
to a heart that's beating...

334
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,617
...huh...

335
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,035
...stops it dead.

336
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,787
Please.

337
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:19,626
- This may hurt a little bit.
- Please. Please don't.

338
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,963
Don't do this.

339
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,924
You know what?

340
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,804
I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry.

341
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:34,808
I'm sorry. I shouldn't do this, and I won't.

342
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:38,312
So just calm down. Calm down.

343
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,815
Okay?

344
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,777
- Gotcha.
- No!

345
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,971
Taah.

346
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,807
You all right?

347
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,025
Did you see his face?

348
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,821
Nothing.

349
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,827
Is Harris still in there?

350
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:39,873
- What's up?
- It's his DNA in the hair. He's the Cusp.

351
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,542
What?

352
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,753
Give it up, Harris.

353
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,589
- What the hell is this?
- Just give me the gun.

354
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,641
You sure you wanna do this?

355
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,897
Gotta go
to where Penelope pulled her car over.

356
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,544
This is taking too long.

357
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,089
I should go back into his memories.

358
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,174
Hello?

359
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,386
No, it's just odd, don't you think?

360
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:37,848
That these tire tracks are here in the mud.

361
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,310
He's got all this dry area...

362
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,730
...parks her car in the mud.

363
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,398
You don't think she pulled off?

364
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,693
I think the Cusp wanted you
to find that shirt and those hairs.

365
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:56,491
So he left the tracks on purpose.

366
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,370
Penelope was already unconscious.

367
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:05,125
Yeah. Skylar was wrong.
Penelope didn't pull her car over here.

368
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,044
The Cusp did.

369
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:19,014
What the hell? Hey. Come on, let's go.

370
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,807
Come on.

371
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:45,368
Young lady, you are going to talk to me.

372
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:51,833
I don't mean "talk,"
but you're gonna give me DNA, something.

373
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,631
Now, that's gonna lead us
right to the Cusp.

374
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,301
And then there's a book deal for me.

375
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,723
Maybe even a feature film.

376
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,142
Surely, a movie of the week.

377
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,686
And after that...

378
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,816
...Oprah.

379
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:20,070
- Doc, what the hell you doing?
- Ooh! Oh, crap.

380
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,447
Harris, half the force is looking for you.

381
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,991
The FBI is telling everyone
you're the Cusp.

382
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,826
- And you believe that?
- Hi.

383
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,411
Hi.

384
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,581
Hey, doc, I need to take a look
at your second victim.

385
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,376
- Glad she's still here.
- Yeah.

386
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,629
FBI's got me doing another rush autopsy.

387
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:41,508
It's just like the first one.
No DNA, no prints, no nothing.

388
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,886
If you add her to the girls the Cusp took
before he came into town...

389
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,681
...she's actually the 23rd victim.

390
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,645
Look, Harris, I know we go way back,
but I could get in a lot of trouble here.

391
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,355
I only need a couple of minutes.

392
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,444
Harris, we gotta go.
- Hold on a second.

393
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,364
- This guy's a real sterilization freak, right?
- Yeah.

394
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,449
He doesn't get his syringes
on the street.

395
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,244
- He buys them.
- And only pharmaceutical companies...

396
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:12,539
...sell to licensed medical facilities,
like hospitals or clinics.

397
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:16,293
So an individual buying syringes
in large quantities is gonna stand out.

398
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,462
Mm-hm. Places like that
keep records of their buyers.

399
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,715
- Doc, I need to ask you a favor.
Hey, listen.

400
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,884
No, hang on. I want you to check
all pharmaceutical companies...

401
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:29,222
...and find out who sold large amounts
of syringes other than hospitals or clinics.

402
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,891
- Okay, look...
- Also check on who bought a blood pump.

403
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,144
- Look, Harris...
- Hey, just trust us on this, okay?

404
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,732
- Man, that was fast. Come on.
- I was trying to tell you...

405
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,324
Let's go.

406
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,354
Come on.

407
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,483
Spare change?

408
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,045
Anything?

409
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,630
Nothing.

410
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:47,175
Damn it. Let's go.

411
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:56,393
Come on. I know a place
they'll never find us. Let's go.

412
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:08,279
- What is this place?
- We call it a safe house.

413
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,494
We can lay low here
until they expand their search.

414
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,621
Won't your deputies know about this?

415
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,833
I don't tell my boys about everything.

416
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,172
- We should probably get started, huh?
- Hey, I don't want you doing that.

417
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,259
- What else were we gonna do?
- I don't know, but it's not safe.

418
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,804
Kessel told me
about how the Cusp got away last time.

419
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,808
I'm sorry.
I don't want you tipping him off.

420
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,861
Oh, God.

421
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,198
I lost control.

422
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,540
I lost myself in his mind.

423
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,709
Got emotional.

424
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,051
And I gave up all my power.

425
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,138
Maybe you should take the power back.

426
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,933
Make the Cusp lose control.

427
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:22,395
The Cusp doesn't lose control.

428
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,825
Are you afraid of the dark?

429
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,833
When people hear it,
that I was in that box for days...

430
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,127
...that's the first thing they ask.

431
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,087
I say, "No.

432
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,340
I'm afraid of the light. "

433
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,176
The dark meant I was safe.

434
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,764
When the light came, then he was back.

435
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,934
And it was time to die again.

436
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:06,481
I don't even remember
what my life was like before all this.

437
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,445
All my memories...

438
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,781
...they're dim.

439
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,576
Not real.

440
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,954
And they're all I had.

441
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,583
- You know I was an artist?
- Yeah?

442
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,252
Yeah.

443
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,212
Hmm.

444
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,216
I haven't drawn a thing
since he took me.

445
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,136
I just sit there for hours...

446
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,431
...just trying to draw his face.

447
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,435
And I can't.

448
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,313
I can't.

449
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:57,448
He stole my life.

450
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,244
We'll get your life back.

451
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,164
We'll get it back.

452
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,256
Please! Help me!

453
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,962
Help me.

454
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,390
Copy, Unit 58. We...

455
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,647
I need backup...

456
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,963
Thought I told you not to do that.

457
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:23,010
Other suspects possibly
in the back seat of the car.

458
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,804
Hello, Maya.

459
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,230
Hmm?

460
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:38,276
Approach with extreme caution.
Possibly armed and dangerous.

461
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,112
There's no eating in the squad car.

462
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:44,365
Roger. Copy that and stand by for...

463
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:50,163
So, what the hell happened anyway?

464
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:54,959
- Nothing. It was nothing.
- That was really stupid.

465
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,881
I said nothing happened.

466
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:09,432
Look. What if this psychopath
becomes aware of your presence?

467
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,267
I was in his memories.

468
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:15,021
You're putting yourself in danger doing that.
All right.

469
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,191
So, anyway, what'd you see?

470
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,151
You were right.

471
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,528
He took her from the parking lot.

472
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,615
All right. Then we gotta go there.

473
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:37,043
Sorry it's been so long
since I've been here.

474
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,670
I've just been crazy. Heh.

475
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:48,429
You are gonna have plenty of time
this time around for last words.

476
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:54,060
You would be amazed how long
it takes to bleed someone to death.

477
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,229
I always am.

478
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,065
Amazed, I mean.

479
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,402
But let me warn you...

480
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,987
...some of the girls...

481
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,534
...well, they don't come back
from this one.

482
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:12,829
I mean, I'm good, but I ain't God. Heh.

483
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,872
At least not yet.

484
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,542
That's a joke.

485
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:32,056
Oh. So boring.

486
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,652
All right,
describe what was inside Penelope's car.

487
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:51,033
Um... It was a normal college girl's car.

488
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,119
A backpack...

489
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,038
...some papers, a folder, some notes...

490
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,708
...a rose.
- A rose?

491
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,961
Yeah.

492
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,674
Did she have it with her
when she was walking across campus?

493
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,676
No, it was already in the car.

494
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,178
Good.

495
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,973
Yeah.

496
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,350
- Harris.
- Yeah.

497
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:19,020
- Look, I tracked down the syringes.
- What'd you find?

498
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:23,065
I couldn't find anyone who ordered a blood
pump, but I did find three individuals...

499
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,568
...who ordered large quantities
of syringes.

500
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:30,364
I've got a Greg Richards, David Berkowitz
and an Arnold Thompson.

501
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:32,241
What was the name of the second one?

502
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,160
David Berkowitz.

503
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,246
That's the real name of the Son of Sam.
What's the address?

504
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,916
- 403 Fordham Street.
- All right, thanks.

505
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:49,258
Listen, I don't want you
in his head again.

506
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,510
I can't kill him if you're in there.

507
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,430
I'm not gonna let this happen
to another girl.

508
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:55,848
We'll get Penelope.

509
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,524
Harris...

510
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,987
...if you get the shot...

511
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,282
...I expect you to take it.

512
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,206
I can't do that.

513
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,666
I've been dead before.

514
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,335
- I know you've been dead before.
- Promise me.

515
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,471
All right, fine.
I promise I'll take the shot.

516
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,706
I got you.

517
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,745
Look at this.

518
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,150
Yeah, smells like chloroform.

519
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,111
This is probably what he used
to knock her out.

520
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,947
I can use it to go in his mind.

521
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:19,658
No. I don't want you doing that.

522
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,036
If he senses you're in there...

523
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,511
FBI.
- Yes.

524
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:41,472
Could you connect me
with Agent Skylar, please?

525
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,849
Where are you going?

526
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,978
I'm going to get this analyzed,
see what it can tell us.

527
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,189
We know what it can tell us.

528
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,025
- I gotta do something, right?
- You can't go back there.

529
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,485
They'll be waiting for you.

530
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,844
Naughty girls. Both of you.

531
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,682
I know the way he's gonna kill her.

532
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,811
I can't let that happen.

533
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:32,731
She's my niece. She's my family.

534
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,574
You have to let me go back
into his mind.

535
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,369
It's been 40 hours.

536
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:48,247
She's died six times.

537
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,499
It's our last chance to save her.

538
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:16,901
Can't leave now.

539
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:21,030
I'm not gonna let her die. Not again.

540
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,407
I promise.

541
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,144
Did that hurt?

542
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,439
What is pain, after all?

543
00:53:55,607 --> 00:54:00,152
Just messages
that your little nerve endings...

544
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,155
...are sending up to your brain.

545
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,785
- Uhn!
- Like so.

546
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:13,040
See? What I'm doing now is sending
a current into your nervous system directly.

547
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,627
Allowing me to cause
the sensation of incredible pain...

548
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:20,839
...without any physical contact whatsoever.
Isn't that amazing?

549
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:25,177
Now, if I was to keep turning
this knob, right?

550
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:30,182
I would cause enough pain that your brain
would order your body to shut down.

551
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,518
Give up the ghost, if you will.

552
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,852
I find that just...

553
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,062
Uh...

554
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,189
Like, what, like...? Watch.

555
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,484
Huh? Huh?

556
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:45,531
Hold that thought.
I do want to get this on tape.

557
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:52,830
Scream. Let it out. Let it go.
Scream, come on.

558
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:56,500
Come on. You're not gonna be the first.
Come on.

559
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:58,210
Come on.

560
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,214
Okay.

561
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:18,063
Fucking lights. Fuck!

562
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,816
No!

563
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,655
See what you did? Goddamn it.

564
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:35,331
Okay.

565
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,500
Oh, gosh.

566
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,092
My apologies. I...

567
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,016
I gotta go check on the power situation.

568
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,652
Hey.

569
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,655
You okay?

570
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,408
Yeah.

571
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,911
What'd you see?

572
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,792
It's like an old factory with a large pool.

573
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,922
I guess.

574
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,049
Looks like it's been there for years.

575
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:30,469
That's gotta be the old chemical plant
on the outside of town.

576
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,389
- By the railroad track.
- Wait. One more thing.

577
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,934
I don't know how important this is.
You know how I'm afraid of the light?

578
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,937
The Cusp is afraid of the dark.

579
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,279
There we go.

580
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:54,827
Oh, crap. Skylar.

581
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:58,163
Go to the chemical plant. Wait for me there.
I'll catch up with you.

582
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,749
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

583
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,671
Hands, Harris.

584
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,215
- Where's Maya?
- She went to find the Cusp.

585
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,885
- According to the DNA, you're the Cusp.
- Come on, those hairs were planted.

586
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,971
Okay, but you gotta come with me.

587
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,771
- Well, that's impressive.
- Listen to me.

588
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:27,067
Maya went inside his head.
She knows he's at the old chemical factory.

589
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:30,237
- That's where she's going now.
- Turn around. Hands on your head.

590
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,114
- Hands on your head.
- Oh, come on.

591
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:35,075
If you're wrong about me,
she's over there by herself.

592
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:38,787
She's gonna die. Penelope's gonna die,
and that's gonna be on your head.

593
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,995
Finch, come on. This is idiotic.
You gotta trust me on this.

594
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:24,541
You know I do. But it's federal now.
They got everybody out on this.

595
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:28,504
Finch, you gotta release me.
This is ridiculous.

596
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,923
No. No can do, sir.

597
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,800
Even if I could,
we don't have a squad car at the station.

598
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:37,888
You'd have to run down to the firehouse
and borrow an EMT truck or something.

599
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,182
Could you please empty out
your pockets for me?

600
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,893
- What did you just say?
- To empty out your pockets.

601
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,811
No, before that.

602
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:49,525
You'd have to borrow an EMT truck
or something?

603
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:15,592
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
Kessel sent me over to check out the place.

604
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:42,661
This is not the greatest place
to be by yourself.

605
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,122
Where could she be?
These buildings look the same.

606
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,291
Yeah, well, we will find her.

607
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:51,169
Meanwhile, I want you to sit here, wait.
Harris is on his way now.

608
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:54,590
No, we have to find her.
He knows I've been in his mind.

609
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,675
Listen, just trust me.

610
00:59:56,843 --> 01:00:01,680
Sit in the car, stay warm,
and Harris will be here soon.

611
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:08,937
I'm gonna go in and have a look around,
okay?

612
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,356
But...

613
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,359
Almost forgot.

614
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,195
Harris asked me to give you this.

615
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,823
You left it down at the station.

616
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:21,742
Be right back.

617
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,244
You think you know who the killer is?

618
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,371
So you're ready to confess?

619
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:29,416
That's funny, Skylar,
but I'm not the Cusp.

620
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,252
You're right about one thing, though.

621
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,670
He is a cop.

622
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,215
A cop with medical training.
A former EMT.

623
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:42,137
A cop who wears a medical bracelet
for his penicillin allergy.

624
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,057
A cop whose locker
is right next to mine...

625
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,976
...and can easily grab
a couple of stray hairs.

626
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:52,022
And he happens to be with Maya
right now, as we speak.

627
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:56,526
Okay, you two get out of here.
You take the chopper.

628
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:59,279
I'll support you with ground units.

629
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,944
What?

630
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:46,118
No!

631
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,708
Remember me?

632
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,670
- What is this place?
- This?

633
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,465
This is just my little playground.

634
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,175
My mind.

635
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,177
This is my world.

636
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,179
This is where I keep them.

637
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,557
You know.

638
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,143
All the ones you couldn't save.

639
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:06,198
How about now,
you remember me now?

640
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,534
Oh! Oh!

641
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:13,038
How? How?

642
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,207
How? How what?

643
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,626
How do I keep you
from recognizing me?

644
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:19,336
How did I set all this up?

645
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:22,714
How'd I keep my girlish figure
and beautiful good looks?

646
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,717
The answer to all three questions
is the same.

647
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:28,220
Hours and hours of preparation.

648
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:31,306
- Up, up, up.
- Ow!

649
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:48,466
Before we get in there,
you know I'm just doing my job, right?

650
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,802
Are we square?

651
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,140
All right.

652
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,812
- You're staying here. I still don't trust you.
- Prick.

653
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:04,608
Now it's time for the big reveal.

654
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,819
Do you wanna know my secret?

655
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,116
Knowing is half the battle.

656
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:17,621
And since dying is the other half,
I think we better stick with this part.

657
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,665
It's all about control.

658
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,835
Light, dark, the collective unconscious.

659
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:26,338
Jung knew it.
Freud thought he knew about it.

660
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:28,840
I live it. I breathe it. I eat it.

661
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:32,302
And now that you're here,
I will become it. Now, ahem.

662
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:38,016
After I dumped your body, which, I admit,
I did a little bit prematurely...

663
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,101
...crazy shit started to happen.

664
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,145
I started having thoughts...

665
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:47,108
...and memories that didn't belong to me.
That weren't mine.

666
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:50,987
I gotta tell you.
Having you inside of here...

667
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:54,950
...was, to say the least, a bit disconcerting.

668
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,534
Freaked me out.

669
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,205
But, with a little study, a little work...

670
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:03,208
...neurology, parapsychology,
paraneurology...

671
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:07,170
...didn't take me long
to figure out how your little talent works.

672
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:10,215
So the next time
you tried to crawl up on in here...

673
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:14,761
...before the FBI gave you
a little fancy protective thing...

674
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,972
...I was ready for you.

675
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:31,236
Here, a synapse stops firing,
and blood flow is diverted...

676
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,780
...from a small part of the brain...
- No, no.

677
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:38,076
And no matter how hard you try...

678
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:42,163
...you simply cannot remember...

679
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,749
...what I look like.

680
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:57,429
Penelope.

681
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,943
I don't know about you,
but I can't wait to get started.

682
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:13,945
You set this up.

683
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,907
You had to know
I was gonna come back for you.

684
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:21,870
- Why am I so special?
- Now, that's a good question.

685
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,247
Well...

686
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:32,589
...first off, you're the only one
that I can have like this.

687
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,924
Secondly...

688
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:38,511
...the only thing that's better...

689
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,473
...than torturing a woman's body...

690
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,478
...is tormenting a woman's mind.

691
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:01,743
Miss?

692
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,829
Miss, where are you?

693
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,968
Isn't it a shame?

694
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:21,096
Don't you wish you could?

695
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:24,766
Don't you just wish like hell
you could remember?

696
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:29,813
Don't you wish you could maintain
some semblance of control?

697
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:35,777
You. You caused so many needless deaths.

698
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,863
Don't you think that is a shame?
Don't you think so?

699
01:08:39,323 --> 01:08:41,366
Don't you think so?

700
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,243
They think so.

701
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:56,589
Remember this?

702
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:58,216
Your 5th birthday.

703
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:01,094
So cute.

704
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:05,056
Gone.

705
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:12,313
Senior prom.

706
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:16,109
What magical moments are these.

707
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:20,155
Gone.

708
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:24,784
- Oh, look. Artist at work.
- No.

709
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:27,871
Gone, daddy, gone.
Are we having fun yet?

710
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,168
No.

711
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,337
Your memories are mine now.

712
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:39,716
And I'm gonna keep going
until all that's left...

713
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:42,010
...is your time with me.

714
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,469
Until all you have...

715
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:44,679
...is me.

716
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:46,764
Hey, remember this?

717
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:49,934
This will be your only memory.

718
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:53,271
- It's all I'm gonna let you have.
- No!

719
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:54,939
You can't do this.

720
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:56,357
I already have.

721
01:09:56,567 --> 01:10:00,695
Your memories are mine.
Your memories are mine now.

722
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:35,313
Oh.

723
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,072
It's okay. It's okay.
Hang on, okay?

724
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,335
Aah!

725
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:18,231
Shh.

726
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:22,860
I don't care about your last words.

727
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,534
Where's the Cusp?

728
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:35,665
So you know exactly
what he's doing to her.

729
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,709
I know.

730
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:40,878
Please don't. He'll kill me.

731
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:46,843
But he'll kill me. I don't wanna die.

732
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:52,056
Your mind is stronger than his.

733
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:54,809
Make him lose control.

734
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:58,646
You have the power.
The power is in your mind.

735
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,733
Get your power back.
Make him lose control.

736
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,193
He's afraid of the dark.
He's afraid of the dark.

737
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,908
Okay.

738
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:15,913
Now it's time for that age-old question
I'd like to pose to all my girls.

739
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:19,584
Heart or mind?

740
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:21,961
Goddamn it!

741
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:27,759
Now you can't see my face.

742
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:29,844
Where are you?

743
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,096
What's happening?

744
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:36,768
Come on, Duncan. Don't you remember?
It's all about control.

745
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:39,354
I'm in control now.

746
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:43,066
Turn the lights on. I need the lights.

747
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:46,903
Because of you, I like the dark.

748
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,364
Sorry to leave you
in the dark there, deputy.

749
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:52,784
Oh. Oh, hey, there. Hey there, sheriff.

750
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:55,244
I'm glad you're here.
I was gonna go and check...

751
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:58,373
See what happened to the lights.
See, because...

752
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:03,711
I can't operate without lights. You know,
a man can't operate without lights, so...

753
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:07,965
All right, that's about good right there.
That's good. Yep.

754
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,761
You're not gonna shoot me.

755
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:15,139
I got everything you need right up in here.

756
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:32,824
Any last words?

757
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:44,710
Bitch!

758
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:08,693
Where is it?

759
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:11,529
- No.
Don't panic now.

760
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:13,030
Fun's just started.

761
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:17,702
You can't do this. It's my work.

762
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,704
You think you know everything.

763
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:21,456
You know nothing at all.

764
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:42,810
Penelope. Are you okay?

765
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:44,187
Are you okay?

766
01:14:44,354 --> 01:14:46,981
Hey, are you all right?

767
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:48,900
All right. Hang on.

768
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:55,573
Hey, it's Harris. I got Penelope.

769
01:15:03,373 --> 01:15:06,292
Okay, it's okay. It's gonna be okay.

770
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,711
I got you. I got you.

771
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:33,069
Sit here. Wait here.

772
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:41,661
One of my men's on the way.
I gotta go.

773
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:36,674
Whoa.

774
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,856
Enjoy the dark.

775
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:54,025
No.

776
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:44,909
Ahh...

777
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,191
Let go of her, Duncan.

778
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,527
Oh. Hey there, sheriff. Okay, sheriff.

779
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,779
Okay, okay. Okay, sheriff. Okay, okay.

780
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:24,949
Here's the deal.
Turn around and go away.

781
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:27,993
Otherwise, I'm gonna slice her
from ear to ear.

782
01:18:28,578 --> 01:18:30,871
I'm gonna slice her and throw her over.

783
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:34,959
- It ends right here, right now.
- It does. You're right about that.

784
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:38,129
You're right, sheriff. It does.
It ends right here.

785
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:42,258
Now turn around and go. So turn around.

786
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:45,886
Mm-hm. Turn around. Turn around.

787
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:49,640
Turn around!

788
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,812
- All right.
- Good boy.

789
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,480
Good boy.

790
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:58,482
Harris.

791
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:01,485
You promised.

792
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:03,654
Yep.

793
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,656
I promised.

794
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:19,128
Before you die, I have a gift for you.

795
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:20,963
Don't kill me.

796
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:24,008
I don't wanna die.
Let me live.

797
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:25,634
These are my girls.

798
01:19:25,802 --> 01:19:27,470
Not anymore.

799
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:29,305
I'm taking them back.

800
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:33,350
- And the life you stole from me.
Please don't kill me.

801
01:19:34,352 --> 01:19:35,436
I die, you die.

802
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:42,943
I've been dead before.

803
01:19:58,043 --> 01:19:59,710
Welcome to the darkness.

804
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:06,258
No.

805
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:32,910
Maya? Maya?

806
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:34,787
Maya, are you okay?

807
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:38,415
Maya, come on.
Come on, Maya. Come on.

808
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:44,088
Maya, wake up. Come on, Maya.
Come on, Maya. Wake up.

809
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:46,257
Hmm.

810
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:48,551
You all right?

811
01:20:48,718 --> 01:20:50,177
Come on.

812
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:56,892
You got your life back.

813
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,395
Thank you.

814
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:45,240
Won't last long.
She's good one more.

815
01:26:45,408 --> 01:26:46,408
Let's go, let's go.

816
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:50,454
Yeah, if it'll run, let's try it.
If it goes, it goes. If it doesn't, it doesn't.

817
01:26:56,961 --> 01:26:59,046
Back it up, and line it up to the jump.

818
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:12,476
- Cut.
- That was a cut. Come back, boys.

819
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:14,978
Thank you very much.
