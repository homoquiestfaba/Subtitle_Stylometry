in some hole makes you a man?

523
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:16,613
Yeah. Seven times.

524
00:53:16,655 --> 00:53:21,952
Almost eight, except the last one got a little
complicated. But I was almost there.

525
00:53:23,162 --> 00:53:25,122
Hey, at least I'm not sewing.

526
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:28,375
Then you're not making any money either.

527
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:39,011
I could try.

528
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:42,347
You could?

529
00:53:42,431 --> 00:53:44,516
Toss me the thread.
You'll see.

530
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:51,064
Let me show you how it's done.

531
00:53:57,863 --> 00:54:01,074
How much do we get for these things,
anyway?

532
00:54:01,158 --> 00:54:03,160
50 cents.

533
00:54:04,453 --> 00:54:06,872
50 cents?

534
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,169
Fine.

535
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:14,463
50 cents.

536
00:54:14,546 --> 00:54:16,673
Fucking American Dream.

537
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:30,187
<i>('Pdro.) This is it. This feels right.</i>
