[cell buzzing]

173
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,291
Yo, where the hell have you been, man?

174
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,207
I just got back.

175
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,457
- But we need to talk about some shit.

[Karim] <i>So you down to hang?</i>

177
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,291
Oh, what, "hang" hang? Like in person?

178
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,625
[JJ] <i>Hell, yeah, I'm down.</i>

179

What's going on over there?

181

It's an ambulance.<i> </i>I just...
I'm walking to the hospital.

182
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,541
Hospital? You good?

183
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,291
- Do you mean, am I using?
- [JJ] <i>No.</i>

184
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,541
No, that's not what I said.

185
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,125
I know you're looking out for me, man.
I appreciate that. Sorry.

186
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,833
I'm actually just going
for a routine check-up with...

187
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,250
your favorite doctor, in fact.

188
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,166
- Who? Sasha?
- [Karim] <i>Uh-huh.</i>

189
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,166
Dang. Man, I bet she looks good in scrubs.

190
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,583
You know, I will tell her that
you've been thinking about that.

191
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,041
No. No, no, no. Come on. Don't do that.

192
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,333
No, J, you know I wouldn't do you
like that. Come on, now.

193
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,666
[Karim] <i>And plus, you're like</i>
<i>a badass FBI agent.</i>

194
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,000
She might actually give you a shot.

195
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,750
I'm not an "agent" agent, per say.
I'm a data analyst.

196
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,416
[Karim] <i>Data analyst? Please tell me</i>
<i>you don't tell anyone else that.</i>

197
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,583
Are you kidding me? Of course, I do.
Cyber's running shit around here.

198
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:21,708
Hey, Shaft.

199
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:22,791
- Aye.
- Conference room. Now.

200
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,416
Um, it's John, sir.

201
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:25,958
Okay, I gotta go.

202
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,708
[laughs]

203
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,291
Yeah, run shit, huh?

204
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,666
[Vietti] <i>All right, everybody, listen up.</i>

205
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,583
[Vietti] As expected, the White House

206
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:36,583
wants to ramp up cyber surveillance
of potential terrorist threats.

207
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,875
Specifically, we are keeping an eye

208
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,666
on the Rashad Azzam Mosque in Harlem,

209
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,666
and its cleric, Farik Bahar,

210
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,041
who's drawn our attention with his
frequent trips to Afghanistan.

211
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:50,250
Now, we are going to need
a complete digital blackout.

212
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,708
- Is that clear?
- [all] Yeah.

213
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,000
The last thing I need is that asshole
from Channel Eight news

214
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,750
spewing some bullshit story
about Islamophobia

215
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,208
running rampant through the Bureau.

216
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,083
So heads on a swivel.

217
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,958
Okay, who wants lead on this?

218
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,458
Anyone else?

219
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,291
Wait, seriously? I can do this.

220
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,625
No. You can't.

221
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,833
Put me in the game, coach. I...

222
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:17,541
Listen, rookie. This isn't some bullshit
exercise they give you at the Academy.

223
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,833
[Vietti] This is the real world.

224
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:22,291
There's a certain hierarchy here
you need to respect.

225
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,208
[low voice] Gotta give respect to get it.

226
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,458
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
What did you just say?

227
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,750
How the hell did you hear that?

228
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:33,166
Listen, kid, I don't have time to deal
with the latest hotshot outta MIT

229
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,500
looking to flex his nuts.

230
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,958
I am dealing with daily terrorist threats,

231
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,541
the worst heroin epidemic
this city has ever seen,

232
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,250
and a seven year old daughter
who wants me to call her "Frank".

233
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,708
You are a rookie.

234
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,208
Know your fucking role.

235
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,250
[Vietti] Pasternack, you run the show.

236
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,416
Meeting dismissed.

237
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,583

238

You want another?

00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,375
Yeah, sure. Why not? [chuckles]

244
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,250
Are you like...

245
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,791
an FBI agent or something?

246
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,750
Yeah, well...

247
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,416
Uh... I'm actually...

248
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,541
more of a data analyst
rather than an "agent" agent,

249
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,083
I'm kind of like a cybersecurity

250
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,250
expert...

251
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay, she left.

252
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,333
- [Karim] Hm.
- [chuckles]

253
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,083
Again, bro. If someone is asking
if you're an FBI agent,

254
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,500
just say you're an FBI agent, man.

255
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,750
- [JJ] Hey, man.
- [Karim] Good to see you.

256
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,583
Especially if she looks like that.

257
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,375
- [Karim] Oh, I got you a little surprise.
- Sasha!

258
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,333
[JJ] Oh, my God!

259
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,750
- Hey!
- [JJ] What's up?

260
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh, it's good to see you.

261
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,166
Oh, you know, when I heard
that you guys were hanging out,

262
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,625
I had to invite myself.

263
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,708
Of course!

264
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,000
I mean, I can't even remember
the last time

265
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,875
the three of us were together.

266
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,125
What do you guys want to drink?
Let me...

267
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,875
- Thank you. Well, I'll have a club soda.
- Can I get a whiskey, please?

268
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:02,791
[laughs]

269
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,833
- [Karim laughs] I'm serious.
- What did you have to leave town for?

270
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:08,791
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I had to send up some stuff

271
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,166
for, uh, my new business.

272
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,916
- New business?
- Wait.

00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,500
Yeah, damn. Okay, so...

276
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,500
It's this rehabilitation program

277
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,958
that me and my Army buddies started.

278
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,333
Basically the idea is to help vets
who were coming back,

279
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,833
who are going through

280
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,916
the same shit that I went through,
with addiction,

281
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,583
and so just sort of helping them out,
get them on their feet.

282
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,041
Oh, shit.

283
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,750
That's... Yo, that's what's up.

284
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,291
There's something else, too.

285
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,500
Something else?

286
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:39,791
Like what?

287
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,208
[Karim] Um...

288
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,708
Sorry, guys. I actually... I gotta go.

289
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,041
- You gotta go?
- [Karim] Yeah.

290
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,708
I gotta go. Some work stuff popped up.

291
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,375
You just said you're gonna
tell us something.

292
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,500
Yeah. And I'll just... text you
about it later in the week. I just...

293
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,875
There's something I gotta do.

294
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,333
Okay.

295
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:00,750
Yo! Karim.

296
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,833
You good?

297
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,000
What? Yeah. No, I'm fine.
Get back in there.

298
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,708
You said that you wanted to talk.
I figured we can talk right now.

299
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,000
No, man. No, that's...

300
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,875
I just want to say... uh, thank you.

301
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,333

for always...

Yeah. But my examination
doesn't negate what the police found.

And when I get drunk,
it just comes out sometimes.

1078

I was this far from being proud of you.

Ah! Late night booty call.

1118
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:03,333
Maybe I underestimated you.

1119
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:05,125
No, we're just friends. [sighs]

1120
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:07,958

1122
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:12,583
I told her we we're going to the mosque.

1123

1124

"No.

1125
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:18,500
It could be dangerous.
What if something goes down?"

1126
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:21,583
A lot of concern for somebody
whose ass you ain't tapping.

1127

Look, me and Sasha...

1128

Just no... There's no ass tapping.

1129
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,000
Ah! But you wanna be
tapping that ass, though, don't you?

Hey, could you grab me
a coconut water, please?

1136
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:47,291
Yeah, coconut water, coming up.

1137
00:48:47,416 --> 00:48:49,333
I could use the electrolytes.

00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:18,541
JJ, turning up on a Tuesday, huh?

1201
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:21,416
On a goddamn Tuesday.
Can you believe that?

1202
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,500
No.

1203
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:24,416
- Boy's got more Shaft than I thought.
- [grunts]

1204
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,375
Yeah, well, let's hope that there's
a prescription for that. Shall we?

1205
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:28,291
Yeah.

1206
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:31,333
[Shaft] Prescribe something
for them tight-ass jeans

1207
00:51:31,416 --> 00:51:33,208
cutting off the blood to your brain.

1208
00:51:33,416 --> 00:51:35,416
[indistinct chatter]

1209
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:40,791
This is not feeling
like a terrorist training ground.

1210
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:42,083
I still don't know.

1211
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:45,750
Is that the girl from the funeral?

1212
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:47,541
- That has to be Anam.
- Yeah.

1213
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:50,375
- [Sasha speaking Arabic]
- [woman speaking Arabic]

1214
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:51,333
May I help you?

1215
00:51:51,416 --> 00:51:52,833
We'd like to talk to Anam.

1216
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:56,416
We didn't get a chance to meet,
but we're childhood friends with Karim

1217
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,583
and we'd really like
to ask you some questions.

1218
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:03,625
I met Karim not long after he returned
from the war.

1219
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:06,708
We didn't start dating
until early last year.

1220
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,500
That's when he got clean.

1221
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,583
Everything was so perfect.

1222
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:12,541
Did Karim have any enemies?

1223
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,291
Somebody want to do him harm?

1224
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:15,208
No.

1225
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:16,750
He had so much to live for.

1226
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:19,250
He was building our new youth center.

1227
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:21,583
Oh!

1228
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:23,958
[Shaft] Yeah, that's nice.

1229
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:25,708
- Any way we can look inside?
- [Farik] No!

1230
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:29,000
You may not.
This is highly inappropriate.

1231
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:31,333
- [Farik] You cannot speak to my daughter.
- Please excuse my father.

1232
00:52:31,416 --> 00:52:32,833
You're father's Imam?

1233
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,083
Yes.

1234
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,875
Sir... Please excuse us.

1235
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:38,000
No. You must leave now.

1236
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:38,916
So...

1237
00:52:39,041 --> 00:52:42,708
are you a Muslim from a Muslim country...

1238
00:52:43,583 --> 00:52:47,666
or did you find Allah in some cell block?

1239
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:49,875
What did you say to me?

1240
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,083
Can we just calm down
for one second, please?

1241
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:54,083
[man] <i>Zakat? Zakat?</i>

1242
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:57,208
Yes. Yes. <i>Zakat.</i> How about a...

1243
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,500
a donation, as a sign of good faith?

1244
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:01,041
Hey, you got change for a 10?

1245
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:02,791
What is that? FBI?

1246
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:04,416
You are FBI.

1247
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,583
What? Where'd you get
that crazy idea from?

1248
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:08,500
Do I look like I'm in the FBI?

1249
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:11,208
Out! Out at once!

1250
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:18,833
Jeez.

1251
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:23,166
You know, I'm trying to give homeboy
the benefit of the doubt,

1252
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,083
but that motherfucker is annoying.

1253
00:53:25,166 --> 00:53:28,166
I need to find out how much <i>zakat</i>
it's gonna take to build one of those.

1254
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,500
Oh, I'm thinking a shitload for sure.

1255
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:35,208
Only problem is, my laptop's
registered to the Bureau.

1256
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:37,041
I need to get to a computer
they can't trace.

1257
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:39,333
I got a computer you can use,
in my office.

1258
00:53:40,458 --> 00:53:41,375
Whoa!

1259
00:53:41,791 --> 00:53:42,875
Where'd you get a computer?

1260
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:44,333
I won it in a game show called

1261
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:47,541
"Beat the Shit Out of a Piece-of-Shit
Drug Dealer and You Get to Keep his Shit."

1262
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:48,500
Cute.

1263
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:51,083
So, I have a shift to catch
at the hospital.

1264
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:53,500
- I'm gonna talk to you later, okay?
- Okay. I'll call you.

1265
00:53:53,583 --> 00:53:55,750
- Okay.
- Or, you know what, I can text you.

1266
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:57,750
Because we've got text history

1267
00:53:57,833 --> 00:53:59,083
for days, so I can...

1268
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:01,791
Yeah. Get the thumbs working on that.

1269
00:54:01,875 --> 00:54:04,250
Why the hell can't you young people
just talk to each other?

1270
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:05,166
Fuck a text.

1271
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,416
It's a phone. Call her.

1272
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,583
Or better yet, why don't you just
take her to dinner,

1273
00:54:08,666 --> 00:54:10,291
and debrief her over the meal?

1274
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:11,541
[Sasha] Dinner?

1275
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:13,708
That actually sounds really nice.

1276
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:15,375
It does.

1277
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:16,875
Yeah. Yeah!

1278
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:19,666
- I'll call you about dinner.
- Awesome.

1279
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,041
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

1280
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:22,208
Bye.

1281
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:24,041
[chuckles]

1282
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:28,500
All right, thanks.

1283
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,750
You got to stop being
so afraid of women, son.

1284
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:35,416
You know, women...

1285
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:38,333
want a man to be a man.

1286
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:40,166
They don't want some pussy.

1287
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,333
Well, some women want some pussy.

1288
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:44,291
And some women want both.

1289
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:46,833
That's my preference. But...

1290
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:50,541
in general, women want a man to be manly.

1291
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:51,833
[car door opens]

1292
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,125
[chuckles]

1293
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:54,333
[car door closes]

1294
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,666
I'm pretty sure women don't like
being told what it is that they like.

1295
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:00,416
See, that's the shit I'm talking about.

1296
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:02,083
Men used to be men.

1297
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:04,250
Now, you millennial motherfuckers
are running around

1298
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:07,500
worrying about what women think,
and how they feel,

1299
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:10,208
and apologizing and shit.
It's embarrassing.

1300
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:13,166
[chuckles] Apologizing is embarrassing?

1301
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:15,333
Yes. Men don't apologize.

1302
00:55:15,416 --> 00:55:16,916
That's a trap they set for us.

1303
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,625
Real men just own their shit.

1304
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:22,583
No. Real men take responsibility
for what they do.

1305
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:24,791
Real men are strong enough to admit
when they're wrong.

1306
00:55:24,875 --> 00:55:26,583
Real men are strong enough
to put their foot

1307
00:55:26,666 --> 00:55:28,583
in a motherfucker's ass
when they get pissed off.

1308
00:55:28,666 --> 00:55:30,375
What is that? The Shaft family motto?

1309
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:32,416
It's an unwritten rule, Stephen A.

1310
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:34,500
Shit. [grunts]

1311
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:37,791
- Who that?
- It's Ma.

1312
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:40,958
Do not tell her you're with me.

1313
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:43,625
[laughs] Oh!

1314
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:46,250
Look who's being a little bitch now.

1315
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:48,375
You're about to be the victim
of the unwritten rule.

1316
00:55:48,458 --> 00:55:50,416
- Don't fuck around.
- Uh-huh.

1317
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:52,041
Hey, Ma.

1318
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:53,041
Hey, baby.

1319
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:54,375
I'm just checking in.

1320
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:57,208
Oh, you know what? I'm so, so happy

1321
00:55:57,291 --> 00:55:58,666
that you called.

1322
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:02,125
Ma, you will not believe
who I've been hanging out with.

1323
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:03,083
[Maya] <i>Who?</i>

1324
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:05,875
Sasha.

1325
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:08,833
[Maya] <i>Aww, Sasha. I love her.</i>

1326
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:11,333
I'm so glad you two have each other
to get through this.

1327
00:56:11,416 --> 00:56:13,208
- [Maya] <i>You tell her I say hi.</i>
- I will.

1328
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:16,041
Listen, I'd love to see you this weekend.
I'm coming into the city tonight

1329
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:17,416
- for a date.
- With who?

1330
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,416
Since when do you
care about me dating?

1331
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:21,625
No, you're right. Sorry, Ma.

1332
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,250
Forget I even said anything.

1333
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:24,625
[Maya] <i>He's picking me up</i>

1334
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,375
from the hotel and taking me
to this place called Trista's.

1335
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,458
Oh.

1336
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:29,666
Well, that's good.

1337
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:32,166
Well, just call me
when you get in town, all right?

1338
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:34,333
- I love you. Talk to you later.
<i>- </i>[Maya] <i>I love you, too, baby.</i>

1339
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:35,333
<i>- </i>[Maya] <i>Bye.</i>
- All right, bye.

1340
00:56:35,416 --> 00:56:37,791
How many motherfuckers
your mom been with since me?

1341
00:56:40,041 --> 00:56:41,333
Nine or ten maybe.

1342
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:43,958
[chuckles] Oh! So nothing serious.

1343
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:44,875
Cool.

1344
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:47,250
[tires squealing]

1345
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:57,000
Wait a minute.
If you don't use a computer,

1346
00:56:57,083 --> 00:56:58,875
how do you keep track
of all your case files?

1347
00:56:59,000 --> 00:56:59,916
I got a system.

1348
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:05,166
[JJ scoffs]

1349
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:06,333
Unbelievable.

1350
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:09,583
You have unlimited information
available to you in seconds,

1351
00:57:09,666 --> 00:57:12,875
the tools to store
and to organize all your files.

1352
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:15,916
Graphics, music, HD porn,
and that's just...

1353
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,708
Whoa, whoa, whoa, HD porn?

1354
00:57:18,541 --> 00:57:19,833
Can you hook that up to the TV?

1355
00:57:20,958 --> 00:57:21,916
Music, too.

1356
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:24,708
[JJ typing]

1357
00:57:26,416 --> 00:57:27,291
Whoa.

1358
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:29,416
All the mosque files are encrypted.

1359
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,625
Like... crazy encrypted.

1360
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:32,541
Shouldn't they be?

1361
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:34,583
[JJ] Yeah, if they're up to
some real shady shit.

1362
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:36,375
All right, I'm gonna
have to work some magic

1363
00:57:36,458 --> 00:57:38,916
if I'm gonna have any chance
of phishing the quantum network

1364
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,041
and converging the endpoint
protection platforms to unlock this data.

1365
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:43,416
Yeah, okay.

1366
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:45,416
Well, you do what you do.

1367
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:54,125
[JJ] I'm in.

1368
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:56,000
Wait, come look at this.

1369
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:58,833
Five hundred thousand dollars

from El Supemercado Fantastico.

00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:05,708
I've been in this neighborhood forever.
I ain't never heard of that one.

1372
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:08,083
Well, apparently, this one just opened up.

1373
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:09,666
A grocery store...

1374
00:58:10,416 --> 00:58:13,666

to the cleric, directly.

[cell buzzing]

1376
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:17,291
Who that?

1377
00:58:17,416 --> 00:58:18,250
It's my boss.

1378
00:58:20,583 --> 00:58:21,625
Agent Vietti.

1379
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:23,458
[Vietti] Why am I looking at
an empty desk?

[JJ on the phone] <i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>You know that mosque?</i>

1381
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:26,291
I think I found some information.

1382
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:28,708
The one I specifically told you
to stay away from?

1383
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:30,833
- Well, yeah. I know, but...
- [Vietti] <i>You disobeyed a direct order.</i>

1384
00:58:30,916 --> 00:58:33,708
You placed a highly classified
operation in jeopardy.

1385
00:58:33,958 --> 00:58:36,416
Effective immediately,
you're on administrative leave.

1386
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,333
What?

1387
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:39,041
For how long?

1388
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:40,666

00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:44,458
Administrative leave.

1391
00:58:44,541 --> 00:58:46,291
"Know my fucking role"?

1392
00:58:46,375 --> 00:58:47,750
I'm the best analyst they've got.

1393
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:50,458
[chuckles] That's what you get
for working for the Man.

1394
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:51,541
[Shaft] So...

1395
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:53,250
you gonna stay on the porch...

1396
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:55,708
or you gonna come run
with the big dogs?

1397
00:58:57,625 --> 00:58:59,125
We're going grocery shopping.

I'm Bennie.

And again...

00:59:33,375 --> 00:59:34,791
who the fuck are you?

1416
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:36,875
Oh, could you give us one moment, please?

1417
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:42,041
Yo, what is wrong with you?

1418
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:43,416
She picked up a bat.

1419
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,833
So what're you gonna do?
You're gonna break her fingers, too?

1420
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:47,041
You can't beat up a woman.

1421
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,791
- Why not?
- Because she's a woman!

1422
00:59:48,916 --> 00:59:50,625
That's like... misogynistic.

1423
00:59:50,708 --> 00:59:53,250
You're the one being misogynistic.
I ain't mention no gender.

1424
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:55,333
You the one bringing up
her being a woman and shit.

1425
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:57,250
- I don't give a fuck about her gender.
- Okay.

1426
00:59:57,333 --> 00:59:58,833
I'm an equal opportunity ass-whooper.

Hi, Bennie.<i> </i>[chuckles]

We don't want any trouble. You know,

1431
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:09,500
we just came to ask you
just a couple of questions.

1432
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:11,958
- [JJ] Oh!
- Damn!

1433
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:14,208
[JJ groaning]

01:00:15,041 --> 01:00:17,541
I was just trying to talk. [moans]

1435
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:20,458
Now, my son says I can't put hands on you

1436
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:22,083
'cause you're a woman.

1437
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:24,041
Now, since I can't whoop your ass,

1438
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:26,541
I'm gonna have to beat the shit...

1439
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:28,208

01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:29,875
[JJ groaning]

1441
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,416
What the fuck?

1442
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:34,125
Oh, there's no non-violent people
in Harlem?

1443
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:35,166
Junior.

1444
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,250
Oh, damn, she's strong.

1445
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:38,708
I think she's ready to talk.

1446
01:00:38,791 --> 01:00:40,291
Oh, it's bleeding.

1447
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:41,958
[groans]

1448
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:43,166
You know this guy?

1449
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,500
<i>Se parece a un come mierda...</i>

1450
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:47,208
English, please.

1451
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:49,708
The boy speaks Mexican, not Puerto Rican.

1452
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:51,458
No.

1453
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:53,000
What about a guy named Farik?

1454
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:57,125
Oh, oh! So you do know Farik.

1455
01:00:57,208 --> 01:00:59,916
Well, let's talk about
that 500k you sent

1456
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,708
Farik and his friends at the mosque.

1457
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:04,041
Hey. You better find
a whole new answer or something,

1458
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:05,833
because he's running out
of things to shoot.

1459
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:10,333
The mosque is a staple of the community.

1460
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:13,750
Supermercado is proud
to support all groups.

1461
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:15,791
- Really?
- Really.

1462
01:01:17,416 --> 01:01:18,458
Hey, you remind me...

1463
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:20,833
Bennie.

1464
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:24,375
Have you and me...

1465
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:27,083
ever done the... horizontal boogie?

1466
01:01:29,208 --> 01:01:30,125
No, <i>papi.</i>

1467
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:33,750
I'd remember fucking a black guy
dressed like Morpheus from <i>Matrix.</i>

1468
01:01:34,416 --> 01:01:35,250

1469
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:38,791
<i>Coño!</i> That shit was ostrich!

01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:39,958
I don't give a fuck.

1471
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:41,333
What was that for?

1472
01:01:41,416 --> 01:01:44,458
I'm sick of these Laurence Fishburne
comparisons. It's just getting old.

1473
01:01:44,916 --> 01:01:45,750
Oh.

1474
01:01:46,916 --> 01:01:48,625
You know what? [sighs]

1475
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:49,916
We're gonna leave you alone.

1476
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:51,333
Yippee.

1477
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,541
<i>Hasta la vista...</i> Bennie.

1478
01:01:58,458 --> 01:02:00,666
I meant to say that shit
like Schwarzenegger.

1479
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:02,125
[JJ] Oh, yeah. You gotta be deeper.

1480
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:03,583
[Shaft] <i>Hasta la vista.</i>

1481
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:06,458
<i>I know I've seen</i>

Bennie somewhere before.

1483
01:02:08,875 --> 01:02:11,458
I ain't sure she wasn't lying
about me tapping that ass.

1484
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:12,791
You've gotta be kidding me, man.

1485
01:02:12,875 --> 01:02:15,458
You're never gonna find anything
on her in this mess.

Ta-da!

1487
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:19,250
No way.

1488
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:22,000
How'd you just do that?

1489
01:02:22,083 --> 01:02:23,375
I told you, I got a system.

1490
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:26,166
This is my "Puerto Ricans
I don't trust" file.

1491
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:29,875
You literally have
a racist-based catalog system?

1492
01:02:30,291 --> 01:02:31,541
Ain't that how the FBI does it?

1493
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:33,750
Yeah, pretty much.

1494
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,958
God-motherfucking-damn!

1495
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:36,958
Got her!

1496
01:02:37,916 --> 01:02:39,333
Oh, shit. That's Bennie!

1497
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:40,833
[Shaft] Mm-hm.

1498
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:42,375
Who's this dude that she's with?

1499
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:46,000
That is Pierro "Gordito" Carrera.

1500
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:48,000
He's been the head of Las Caras boys,

1501
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:49,708
you know, the baddest gang up in Harlem,

1502
01:02:49,791 --> 01:02:51,125
since like forever.

1503
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:52,416
Those motherfukers

1504
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,333
were the ones responsible for bringing
crack into the hood in the '80's.

1505
01:02:55,416 --> 01:02:57,916
Now, they're the reason
45's talking about

1506
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,916
[hoarse voice] "an opioid epidemic."

1507
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,083
But what I can't figure out,
is what business

1508
01:03:03,166 --> 01:03:06,541
a motherfucker like this
has got with a mosque.

1509
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:09,625
Maybe Supermercado Fantastico
is just a front

1510
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:11,375
for the Las Caras' drug money.

1511
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:13,750
You know, they could be using

1512
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:15,500
the cleric's mission trips

1513
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:17,916
over to Afghanistan to bring in heroin.

1514
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:20,916
Karim probably found out about it,
and they killed him

1515
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,166
because he was gonna
blow the whistle on the whole thing.

1516
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,708
That's very, very possible.

1517
01:03:24,791 --> 01:03:28,458
Damn. I can't wait to push this
in Vietti's stupid face.

1518
01:03:28,541 --> 01:03:29,416
No, no, no, no.

1519
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,208
We're gonna solve this shit ourselves.

1520
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:33,708
Then, I tell you the Shaft way

1521
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:36,000
to tell that dick head boss of yours
to kiss your ass.

1522
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:40,291
- No, that's... that's what I meant.
- But first, we gotta put eyes on Bennie.

1523
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:41,666
So we can get some proof.

1524
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:43,833
So, I'mma go out, get some coffee,

1525
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:47,250
a bunch of Papaya dogs, and we gonna do
an old-fashioned stakeout.

1526
01:03:47,333 --> 01:03:49,208
How about we don't do anything

1527
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:50,708
that starts with "old-fashioned"?

1528
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:52,208
[JJ] I...

1529
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:55,000
planted a micro-cam on Bennie's desk.

1530
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:00,500
Hm.

1531
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:03,291
So, you know, we can watch the footage
back tomorrow morning.

1532
01:04:03,416 --> 01:04:04,583
Take the night off, Big Dog.

1533
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:07,125
I'mma go get dressed
for dinner with Sasha.

1534
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:08,333
Hanging out with Mom after.

1535
01:04:08,416 --> 01:04:11,333
Why the fuck would you be
hanging out with your mom after,

1536
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:13,833
when you should be knee-deep in pussy?

1537
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:14,916
Knee-deep?

1538
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,375
I don't even know what direction the...

1539
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,958
You know what? Nevermind. You're right.

1540
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:22,541
I don't know where in the world
I would be without your fatherly wisdom.

1541

1543
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:28,291
Go tear that ass up, son.

1544
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:30,583
Oh, you wanna use my car?

1545
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:32,583
No, I don't have no driver's license.

1546
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:34,083
Me, neither.

1547
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:36,958
And, son, remember.

1548
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:41,250
It's your duty... to please that booty.

1549
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:43,500

1550
01:04:45,416 --> 01:04:47,041
Give her the Shaft, Big Boy.

1551
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,250
This is crazy.

1552
01:04:49,416 --> 01:04:52,666
You're telling me that the cleric
and this gang are working together?

1553
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:54,833
Yeah, it was hard for me
to believe that at first, too.

1554
01:04:54,916 --> 01:04:57,166
Even if any of this is true,
why would Karim

1555
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,958
- have anything to do with it?
- [JJ] I don't know,

1556
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:00,250
but I'mma find out.

1557
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:02,625
And when I do,
whoever killed him is gonna be sorry.

1558
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,166
Starting to sound a lot like your dad.

1559
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,125
What?

1560
01:05:07,541 --> 01:05:08,458
Are you serious?

1561
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:09,416
Hm-hm.

1562
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:13,333
You motherfucking think I sound
like that goddamn motherfucker?

1563
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:14,375
[chuckles]

1564
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:19,625
He's actually really funny, though.

1565
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:22,916
And you should see the way the people
in Harlem react to him. He's like...

1566
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:24,541
a legend. [chuckles]

1567
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:27,166
Well, I mean, I'm happy your dad's funny,

1568
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:28,541
but it doesn't make up for the fact

1569
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:32,000
that he abandoned you when you were a baby
and wanted nothing to do with you.

1570
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:34,250
All right. Look.

1571
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:38,333
[sighs] He's obviously...

1572
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:39,833
screwed up.

1573
01:05:39,916 --> 01:05:41,125
Borderline insane.

1574
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:44,166
But, deep down, I feel like
he's actually an okay dude.

1575
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:46,125
Don't get me wrong.

1576
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:51,250
There's no way that I'm just gonna forget
that he abandoned me as a kid.

1577
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:54,166
Okay.

- Would you like me to take your coat?
- Oh, sure. Thank you.

1582

Ooh, lookie here.
Will someone call <i>Ripley's,</i>

1583

is too beautiful to be believed.

1584
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:11,583
[giggles] Thank you so much.

1585
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:13,458
Well, you know,
you don't look so bad yourself.

1586

You're a Super Bowl hero.

Not ID, porno star.

- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1591
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:25,583
You know him?

1592
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:27,375
Unfortunately.

1593
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,833
Who is he exactly?

1594
01:06:28,958 --> 01:06:32,458
Just somebody who destroys everything
he touches and never seems to go away.

1595
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:34,416
Oh, he's a contractor.

1596
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:37,875
[stammers] I'm sorry, I'm... I'm...

1597

1598
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:41,291
I just need to go to the bathroom.

1599

- That is what you said.

1605
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:53,916
I'll be waiting.

1606

1612
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,125
Mm... Never long enough.

1617
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:17,416
It's lovely to meet you both.

1618
01:07:17,958 --> 01:07:19,375
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1619
01:07:19,458 --> 01:07:21,291
I am actually on a date.

1620

That's where the guy pays for your dinner
before you have sex with him and...

Did they look sad to you?
They looked sad to me.

- number 11.
- No, no.

That is not true.

No offense, but this is a table for two.

Yes, it is.

Ron, let's go. I told you
he was an asshole.

You know that's not true.

01:28:18,333 --> 01:28:20,375
I'm actually a little impressed
that you found me.

2050
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:23,708
I keep telling you I know way more
about this city than that GPS shit.

2051
01:28:25,416 --> 01:28:27,833
You know what? I think I can
track Sasha's phone.

2052
01:28:28,958 --> 01:28:30,333
I just gotta get to a computer.

2053
01:28:30,416 --> 01:28:31,958
I got you. Officer Thomas!

2054
01:28:32,041 --> 01:28:33,125
[Shaft] Let me holla at you.

2055
01:28:35,833 --> 01:28:36,833
What is it, Shaft?

2056
01:28:36,916 --> 01:28:39,375
You got something you wanna tell me
about this little shitstorm

2057
01:28:39,458 --> 01:28:40,833
- that blew through here?
- [Shaft mumbles]

2058
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:41,833
No.

2059
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:44,416
But my son needs to book a flight.

2060
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,041
You mind if he uses your computer?

2061
01:28:47,375 --> 01:28:48,291
Book a flight.

2062
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:49,750
Mm-hm.

2063
01:28:54,541 --> 01:28:56,666
[JJ] So Cutty was running the drugs.

2064
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:58,208
Gordito was selling them.

2065
01:28:58,375 --> 01:28:59,833
And Bennie was laundering the money.

2066
01:28:59,916 --> 01:29:02,041
[woman] Excuse me...
I'm sorry. Do y'all

2067
01:29:02,125 --> 01:29:03,125
want some mints?

2068
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:06,125
[woman] Charge your cell phone?
Y'all need some music...

2069
01:29:06,208 --> 01:29:07,500
No, thank you. We're good.

2070
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:09,666
All right, if you need something,
you just let me know.

2071
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:11,833
- I got it all right here for you, okay?
- Okay.

2072
01:29:11,916 --> 01:29:13,208
So, I figure

2073
01:29:13,291 --> 01:29:15,625
Dominguez was using Cutty as a pawn,

2074
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,833
to get in the gang
with Bennie and Gordito.

2075
01:29:18,916 --> 01:29:20,125
Did you say "Gordito"?

2076
01:29:20,208 --> 01:29:21,833
Ain't that like a big burrito
or something?

2077
01:29:21,916 --> 01:29:23,083
Say what?

2078
01:29:23,166 --> 01:29:24,208
[woman] Shit is good.

2079
01:29:24,333 --> 01:29:25,791
When the other Brothers found out,

2080
01:29:25,875 --> 01:29:27,500
then Cutty tried to just cut him in,

2081
01:29:27,583 --> 01:29:28,583
but Karim wouldn't go for it.

2082
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:30,125
[woman] Hey, speaking of the Kareems,

2083
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:33,000
why come y'all think it is that Jabbar
don't get the credit he deserves?

2084
01:29:33,083 --> 01:29:34,791
He scored more points than Jordan,

2085
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:36,083
- LeBron...
- Babycakes.

2086
01:29:36,166 --> 01:29:37,375
- Mm?
- In case you ain't noticed,

2087
01:29:37,458 --> 01:29:39,833
we're trying to work some shit out
back here, all right?

2088
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:43,041
You just having a conversation
out loud, so I thought I could be in it.

2089
01:29:43,125 --> 01:29:44,000
[woman] My bad.

2090
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:46,208
Now, that still don't explain the mosque.

2091
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:48,041
Well, maybe when Karim
didn't take the money,

2092
01:29:48,166 --> 01:29:51,125
they tried to just make him happy
by having Bennie forward his amount

2093
01:29:51,208 --> 01:29:52,083
to the cleric.

2094
01:29:52,166 --> 01:29:54,666
Right. That way, the cleric wouldn't know
the money was dirty.

2095
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:55,708
Yeah, but I don't think

2096
01:29:55,791 --> 01:29:57,625
that Karim could live
with knowing the truth,

2097
01:29:57,708 --> 01:29:59,250
and Cutty couldn't have any loose ends,

2098
01:29:59,333 --> 01:30:00,416
so their only option...

2099
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:01,958
- Kill Karim.
- Kill Karim.

2100
01:30:02,041 --> 01:30:02,958
[woman gasps]

2101
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:05,291
- Y'all want to kill Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?
- [JJ] No!

2102
01:30:05,375 --> 01:30:08,125
But I'm about to kill you,
if you don't mind your damn business

2103
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:09,208
and drive this fucking car.

2104
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:10,833
[chuckles]

2105
01:30:11,541 --> 01:30:12,791
If we gonna take on Las Caras,

2106
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:14,791
we're gonna need a lot more firepower.

2107
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:16,541
I know just the motherfucker
to hook us up.

2108
01:30:17,083 --> 01:30:20,541
Look here, sweetheart. I need to
change the address we're going to.

2109
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:21,875
Oh, you talking to me now?

2110
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:24,583
I don't actually need to know.
You just need to put it into the app.

2111
01:30:24,666 --> 01:30:25,833
Put it in the what?

2112
01:30:25,916 --> 01:30:27,250
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

2113
01:30:27,333 --> 01:30:29,375
How come I couldn't just tell her
where we're going?

2114
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:49,583
No doorbell?

2115
01:30:49,666 --> 01:30:50,916
[Shaft] He don't believe in those.

2116
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
- Just bang on the door on your left.
- [JJ] Okay.

2117
01:30:53,083 --> 01:30:54,875
[Shaft] You know,
on second thought, fuck it.

2118
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:59,166
This motherfucker never locks his door.

2119
01:31:01,166 --> 01:31:02,666
Yo, where you at?

2120
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:04,833
<i>But I'm not an alcoholic. I'm a drunk.</i>

2121
01:31:06,583 --> 01:31:09,041
<i>Alcoholic gotta go</i>
<i>to them goddamn meetings.</i>

2122
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,375
[John] That's far enough, punks.

2123
01:31:12,666 --> 01:31:13,541
Pop.

2124
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:14,833
Pop?

2125
01:31:14,916 --> 01:31:15,791
It's me.

2126
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:17,833
Son?

2127
01:31:18,416 --> 01:31:19,666
Wait. Grandad?

2128
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:21,208
No, it can't be.

2129
01:31:22,416 --> 01:31:23,583
Damn. You look like shit.

2130
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:24,750
[chuckles]

2131
01:31:24,833 --> 01:31:27,166
How could you look 20 years older
than my gray ass?

2132
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:28,833
Yeah, it's good to see your ass, too.

2133
01:31:29,625 --> 01:31:30,541
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2134
01:31:32,125 --> 01:31:32,958
Wow.

2135
01:31:34,958 --> 01:31:36,208
You're my grandson?

2136
01:31:37,583 --> 01:31:39,208
I haven't been able to see you
since your daddy

2137
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:42,041
drove your light-skinned ass
way the hell upstate.

2138
01:31:42,416 --> 01:31:44,583
Only you could be
a worse father than I was.

2139
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:46,583
- You were a wonderful father.
- Hm-hm.

2140
01:31:46,666 --> 01:31:48,375
After you stopped pretending
to be my uncle.

2141
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,166
Wait, what?

2142
01:31:50,625 --> 01:31:51,750
Don't pay attention to him.

2143
01:31:51,833 --> 01:31:54,333
Come over here
and give your granddaddy some love.

2144
01:31:54,958 --> 01:31:56,208
[John and JJ laughs]

2145
01:31:56,291 --> 01:31:57,166
Y'all hungry?

2146
01:31:57,875 --> 01:31:59,125
- Want some grits?
- Yeah.

2147
01:31:59,208 --> 01:32:00,583
Grits? What's that?

2148
01:32:01,291 --> 01:32:02,333
It's a long story.

2149
01:32:03,541 --> 01:32:06,000
- Look, I need to ask you a favor.
- What you need?

2150
01:32:06,083 --> 01:32:07,041
You still packing?

2151
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:08,333
[chuckles] "Still packing".

2152
01:32:08,416 --> 01:32:10,958
Boy, back in the day, we didn't need guns.

2153
01:32:11,041 --> 01:32:13,125
[John] All we needed
was our bare knuckles.

2154
01:32:13,208 --> 01:32:14,625
Oof. Old school.

2155
01:32:14,708 --> 01:32:16,083
- Okay. [chuckles]
- [John chuckles]

2156
01:32:17,625 --> 01:32:19,375
But you can't be too prepared.

2157
01:32:19,458 --> 01:32:20,458
Oh, yeah.

2158
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:22,875
What the hell?

2159
01:32:25,333 --> 01:32:26,166
Damn!

2160
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:27,708
Grandpa!

2161
01:32:28,625 --> 01:32:30,291
Yo, what don't you have?

2162
01:32:34,625 --> 01:32:35,583
So, what's the gig?

2163
01:32:36,041 --> 01:32:38,875
Oh, drug kingpin, military scandal,

2164
01:32:38,958 --> 01:32:42,333
bad guys holding Junior's girl hostage.
You know, the usual.

2165
01:32:43,041 --> 01:32:44,250
Usual shit. Yeah.

2166
01:32:47,833 --> 01:32:49,916
<i>You remember when your parents</i>
<i>used to help you with your homework?</i>

2167
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,750
<i>You'd go to school the next day,</i>
<i>and it'd all be wrong. Remember that shit?</i>

01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:53,666
[clicks]

2169
01:32:55,125 --> 01:32:57,083
Thanks, Pops. I'm gonna get
this shit back to you.

2170
01:32:57,166 --> 01:32:58,375
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up.

2171
01:32:58,458 --> 01:33:01,916
You think I'm just gonna give you my shit
and let you have all the fun without me?

2172
01:33:02,125 --> 01:33:03,875
Hell, no. I'm coming with you.

2173
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:06,333
You sure?

2174
01:33:06,416 --> 01:33:09,250
Damn right, I'm sure.
I'm bored as hell up in here.

2175
01:33:10,125 --> 01:33:10,958
All right.

2176
01:33:11,416 --> 01:33:12,500
Let's go get your girl.

2177
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:14,458
Yeah. Let's get Gordito's ass.

[menacing music plays]

2179
01:33:44,875 --> 01:33:47,916
I don't know, man. I do not like her
just sitting there without restraints on.

2180
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,916
Where the fuck's she gonna go, Cutty?

- Can I help you gentlemen?
- [John] Yeah.

2189
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:35,416
I was telling my boys here,
that even at my age...

2190
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:37,125
I could take you.

2191
01:34:37,208 --> 01:34:39,833
Come on, Pop. Ain't you got
something better to do?

2192
01:34:39,916 --> 01:34:41,916
Sound like to me
he's calling you out, homes.

2193
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,500
That is... unless you're scared.

2194
01:34:43,583 --> 01:34:44,416
Scared? [mutters]

01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:45,833

- Come on.

01:34:45,916 --> 01:34:46,958
Okay.

2197
01:34:47,041 --> 01:34:48,250
Take your vitamins? [chuckles]

2198
01:34:49,375 --> 01:34:50,625
Are you trying or what?

Hey, where you going?

2201
01:34:54,375 --> 01:34:55,500
- Huh?
- [John grunts]

[body thudding]

2203
01:34:58,583 --> 01:34:59,416
Still got it.

2204
01:35:00,458 --> 01:35:02,916
I bet if we were wrestling
for some French fries,

2205
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:03,875
he might have won.

2206
01:35:03,958 --> 01:35:07,375
Not regular fries. For some chili
cheese fries, he'd kick your ass.

for the lobby and the elevator.

2210
01:35:12,416 --> 01:35:14,791
I'mma just go ahead and create a loop,
and I can use my phone.

2211
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:17,500
A loop. Is that where they don't see us
when we're on the elevator?

2212
01:35:17,583 --> 01:35:20,416
- Exactly. See, you're learning.
- That shit don't never work in the movies.
