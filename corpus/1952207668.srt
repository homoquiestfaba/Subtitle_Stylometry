That's a very pretty shawl

We were due at a quarter
past 1:00. You're late.

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,116
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House
is not as you will remember it.

No one's allowed to leave the building
while the Queen is at home.

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,955
On rare occasions when she's out,
you may ask permission to leave,

62
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,877
but only
with my consent.

63
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,673
You're to be ready to walk the pony
at any time after 10:00.

64
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,677
You'll clean the Queen's
outdoor things...

65
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,509
and do any odd jobs
as and when she requires.

How will I know?

67
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,477
I'm sorry?

68
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,309
- How will I know
what the Queen requires?
- You'll be sent a message.

69
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,035
- And who will bring it to me?
- Her Highness's equerry.

70
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,071
I'll need a man
who knows where I am.

71
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,078
- Oh, I don't think it'd be
difficult to find you.
- That's not good enough.

- Then we'll have to see
what can be arranged.
- Aye. Do.

As I'm sure you'll remember
from Balmoral,

74
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,436
you do not speak
while in Her Majesty's presence,

75
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,313
unless Her Majesty
addresses you directly.

76

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,437

- Mr Brown.
- Ma'am.

- I am.

- And the pony?
- She's well too.

82
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,556

83
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,916
It was much appreciated.

84
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,792
I'm glad of it.

85
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,391
My husband was always very complimentary
in speaking of you.

86
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,354
He would have approved, I'm sure,
of my calling on you in this way.

87
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,712
I trust it does not
inconvenience you too much.

88

I have no family, ma'am.
Only my brothers and sisters.

Yes.

You have a brother
in service here, do you not?

91
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,869
- I forget his name.
- Archie.

92
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,797
Yes.

93
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,317
That will be company
for you.

94
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,079

96
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,153
Honest to God, I never thought
to see you in such a state.

97
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,556
You must miss him
dreadfully.

98
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,955
You do not...

99
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,877
He...

100
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,710
Get him out!
Get him out of here!

101
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,800
Get him out!
Get him out!

102
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,436
So, the day they arrived,

103
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,155
she greets the sultan and
his family with barely a word
and retires to her chamber.

104
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,511
Now, the sultan, he's not used to
state occasions without a head of state,

105
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,269
and he's standing in the lobby waiting
for someone to tell him what to do.

106
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,029
But the court
is under strict instructions
not to talk in the corridor,

107
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,789
so nobody speaks to him, not
a living soul, for the whole afternoon.

108
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,674
So now it's dinner,
and everyone's standing around
the table, still not a word,

109
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,791
waiting for Her Majesty
to arrive.

110
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,311
One hour goes by, two.
The sultan is getting a wee
bit peckish, to say the least.

111
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,877
Finally, his wee laddie
breaks for the cold meats
and stuffs a slice in his mouth.

112
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,991
Oh, the uproar
when she heard.

113
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,908
- You'd have thought somebody
had stolen the crown jewels.
- So?

114
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,919
[Sighing] So there are rules.
Things you do and don't do.

115
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,396
All I did was tell the woman
how I feel, for God's sake.

116
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,399
- You don't tell Her Majesty
how you feel.
- I speak as I find, Archie.

117
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,317
Not down south you don't.

118
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,197
- So, what did Ponsonby do
when she started shouting?
- [Slams Drawer Shut]

119
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,469
[Sighing]
I thought he nearly ruptured his truss.

120
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,839
Prince Leopold? Now isn't he the one
who sits around bleedin' all day?

121
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,509
So what does his valet do?
Bring out his bandages for him?

122
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,710
It's better than
shovelling horseshit.

123
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,592
Now, if it's promotion
you're after,

124
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,029
you should've picked
one of the healthier ones.

125
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,628
She's hardly
a full hamper herself.

126
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,194
It's only grief that's
made her that way.

127
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,073
Three years, John? Is that not
a bit long to be grieving?

128
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,839
- She loved him.
- Come on, man.

129
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,475
- There's love. Then there's...
- What?

130
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,319
- [Pitcher Thuds]
- You know what I mean.

131
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,431
I don't think I do, Archie.

132
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,630
There's love, and there's
behaving like you do...

133
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,513
because there's nobody
to tell you not to.

134
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,272
So, which one of us
was she flirtin' with?

135
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,311
The good-looking one.

136
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,671
Obviously doesn't have
enough to do.

137
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,314
You work the system right,
you could ask her yourself.

138
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,670
Just be thankful you're not working
for the household.

139
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,110
The Queen never lets them
out of her sight.

140
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,869
But wee spats like us can slip
through the net easy.

141
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,872
I'm no wee spat, Archie.

142
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,597

00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,715

Don't just stare at him.

[Neighing]

145
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,197
Who is that?

146
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,112
- It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
- What is he doing there?

147
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,152
He appears to be standing
by his horse, ma'am.

148
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,078
I made no request
to go out riding today.

149
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,997
How long
has he been there?

150
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,591
I don't know, ma'am.
He was observed earlier, I believe.

151
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,638
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing
in the courtyard.

152
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,753
- I've no wish to go riding.
- I'm very sorry, ma'am.
I can't imagine...

153
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,155
He was certainly given
no instructions.

154
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,919
Please make sure
it does not happen again.

155
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,996
Of course. At once.

156
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,949
- What on Earth did you think
you were doing?
- Awaiting my orders.

157
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,470
You do not report for duty
unless the Queen requests of it.
You know that very well.

158
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,798
I didn't come all this way
to sit on my arse.

159
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,118
You'll await your orders
like everyone else...

160
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,993
unless you prefer a repeat
of yesterday's little excitement.

161
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,793
No.

162
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,115
I beg your pardon?

163
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,751
I thought I made myself
perfectly clear.

164
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,950
You do not leave your room
until Her Majesty requests it.

165
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,036
You tell Her Majesty
from me...

166
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,799
if her husband was here today,
he'd have her outta the house...

167
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,717
and gettin'
some air into her.

168
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,274
What the hell's the point
of me bein' here otherwise?

169
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,557
Go inside at once.

170
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,716
Is that the Queen's request?

171
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,354
Yes. It most certainly is.

172
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,551
[Clicks Tongue]

173
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,836
- [Horse Neighing, Whinnying]
- Mr Brown?

174
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,197
Yes, ma'am?

175
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,436
You have been told repeatedly
not to stand in the courtyard...

176
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,357
unless requested to do so.

177
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,596
Yes, ma'am.

178
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,836
Then why do you persist
in doing it?

179
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,554
Because I believe
Her Majesty's wrong.

180
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,070
If ever a poor soul
needed some fresh air, it's her.

181
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,634
The Queen will ride out
if and when she chooses.

182
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,797
And I intend to be there
when she's ready.

183
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,748
Prince Albert was going
to build a bench here.

184
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,394
He thought it one
of the best views in Osborne.

185
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,909
Aye, it's a fine spot, ma'am.

186
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,031
He thought so, yes.

187
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,111
In everything I do
and everything I say,

188
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,629
I try to think
as much as possible...

189
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,513
what he would do or say
if he were here now.

190
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,469
My private secretary wishes me
to return to public duties.

191
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,194
If Prince Albert was here,
he'd tell him a thing or two.

192
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,199
Sir Henry's not alone.
They all wish it.

193
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,075
The same people who refused to grant
my husband the title of "King"...

194
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,476
because he was deemed
of insufficient rank.

195
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,793
I have some letters in my saddlebag.
I'd like to read them.

196
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,154
I cannot read them
like that.

197
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,634
You will hand them to me
as I require.

198
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,510
[Chattering]

199
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,597
[Chattering Stops]

200
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,395
Mr Carter, the head butler,
sits there.

201
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,593
Not any more he doesn't.
This is my place.

202
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,154
- By whose authority?
- My own.

203
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,029
The order of seating
at the upper servants' table...

204
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,913
is arranged personally
by the Queen herself.

205
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,951
Now that's a tautology, lad.

206
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,877
If you say the Queen
has arranged something,

207
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,831
there's no need to say
she's done it personally.

208
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,757
It's understood.

209
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,157
- [Murmuring]
- [Man] Thank you.

210
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,197
And you're the Queen's dresser,
I believe.

211
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,035
Assistant, sir. Yes.

212
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,799
- What's your name?
- Mary Taylor, sir.

213
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,717
Have I seen you
up at Balmoral, Mary?

214
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,274
I hope to go up next year.

215
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,234
Tell me, Mary. What is the Queen
reading for recreation these days?

216
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,157
Lord Tennyson, sir.

217
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,997
[Murmuring Stops]

218
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,837
Ah!

219
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,515
Am I the only one eating?

220
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,916
Lord Clarendon arrives
by invitation at 11:00,

221
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,716
followed at 12:00 by a picnic
on the grounds to celebrate
Princess Alice's birthday.

222
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,718
The chancellor writes to say
that by happy coincidence,

223
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,149
he will be in Cowes
this weekend,

224
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,434
and he asks if Your Majesty
might grant him an audience.

225
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,551
Why?

226
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,911
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty
might wish to be informed...

227
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,837
of the latest developments
in government.

228
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,838
No, I shall be out walking.

229
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,520
Then, perhaps, Your Majesty
might consider it opportune...

230
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,598
if the Prince of Wales
were to meet him on your behalf.

231
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,280
On no account.

232
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,188
Mama, I really do think it's time
we made ourselves a little more...

233
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,117
[Clears Throat]
available.

234
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,557
I think
we must accept...

235
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,148
that our position in the country
is not entirely unrelated...

236
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,352
to the continued absence
of the monarchy from public life.

237
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,550
I thought, perhaps, we might consider
a small gesture of some kind.

238
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,558
- Gesture?
- I thought a dinner
for our ambassadors, perhaps.

239
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,673
No dinners, Bertie.
Why are you dressed for outdoors?

240
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,031
- It's so infernally cold in here.
- Cold is good.

241
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,799
Is that not so,
Dr Jenner?

242
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,717
[Gasping]
Uh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

243
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,752
- Cold is good!
- Oh, excellent, ma'am. Excellent.

244
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,269
But perhaps if Her Majesty...

245
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,836
were to consider accompanying
her newfound physical vigour...

246
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,712
with the benefits
of mental activity.

247
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,796
Why am I being lectured
in this way?

248
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,549
- Oh, forgive me, Your Majesty.
- I will not tolerate
anybody lecturing me...

249
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,636
- about the responsibility of monarchy.
- Mother.

250
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,035
Least of all my son!

251
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,072
It was his irresponsibility
that drove my husband to his grave!

252
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,589
If it is inconvenient
to Her Majesty,

253
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,517
then perhaps she might consider
allowing the Prince of Wales...

254
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,074
Would you believe they sent me
so many boxes to taunt me?

255
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,796
Dr Jenner writes that my nerves are
in an extremely fragile state,

256
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,956
and yet they continue to
hound me with box after box...

257
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,719
after box after box
after box.

258
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,637
[Sighing]

259
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,876
I wish to take the princesses
for a swim.

260
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,194
The turns I have been taking
in the grounds have proved
most beneficial to me,

261
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,118
and Brown thinks saltwater
will do me good.

262
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,752
Don't putter, children. Swim!

263
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,988
You could buy that lot
for garden ornaments...

264
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,554
and still get change
from ten guineas.

265
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,476
Lift your foot, woman!

266
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,511
[Brown] Walk on.
[Clicks Tongue]

267
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,437
[Man]
This nation is fortunate...

268
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,950
insomuch as it is not governed
by force...

269
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,196
but by a chain of traditions...

270
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,711
that have been cherished
from generation to generation.

271
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,152
Because in them...
in our traditions...

272
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,478
are embodied all the laws that have
enabled us to create...

273
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,831
the greatest empire
of modern time!

274
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,757
[Cheering]

275
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,475
And even though
we have amassed great capital,

276
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,478
and even though
we have established an industry...

277
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,353
with no parallel
in the world.

278
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,119
Yet all these
mighty creations...

279
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,117
are as nothing...

280
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,516
compared to
the invisible customs...

281
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,790
which shape our lives.

282
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,717
[Cheering]

283
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,037
To those honourable gentlemen of
the opposition that seek to destroy...

284
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,469
the essential elements
of this country...

285
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,876
I say,
let them remember...

286
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,438
England cannot begin again!

287
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,357
[Shouting]

288
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,117
Have you seen this?

289
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,911
Should we
take it seriously?

290
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,476
- The cartoon,
or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
- Well, both.

291
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,511
The question is:
Do we need her?

292
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,871
- Congratulations.
- Too kind. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

293
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,116
Surely you're not suggesting
we dispense with the Constitution?

294
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,869
My dear Stanley, a prime minister
with only a handful of friends...

295
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,831
must respect
public opinion.

296
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,757
- Congratulations, Prime Minister.
- Thank you.

297
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,997
Gossip counts.
Lord Aberdeen was right.

298
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,351
This country is not governed
by wisdom but by talk.

299
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,710
Oh, granted,
it wouldn't take too much...

300
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,956
to winkle the old girl
out of mourning,

301
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,877
but if public opinion
is against her,

302
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,434
it doesn't do
to appear too close.

303
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,677
- So?
- We'll see which way the wind blows.

304
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,757
[Whooping]

305
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,037
[Shouting]

306
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,355
My heart's
in the Highlands!

307
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,914
My heart is not here!

308
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,794
My heart's in the Highlands,
chasing the deer!

309
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,516
One box of biscuits, one box
of drop tablets. one box of pralines,

310
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,029
16 chocolate sponges.

311
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,630
It's the same order every week. Does one
of them even bother to check it?

312
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,557
The woman's goin'
to Balmoral tomorrow...

313
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,911
without the one wee luxury
she actually enjoys.

314
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,952
Look, someone'll
send it on ahead.

315
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,196
Oh, aye,
but will they?

316
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,754
It's not your problem,
what she eats, John.

317
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,913
The woman's surrounded
by fools.

318
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,837
She's supposed to be packed,
dressed and ready...

319
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,916
tomorrow mornin',
half past 7:00.

320
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,032
If it's up to any of them, she'll
still be gettin' dressed at 8:00.

321
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,118
She's got an army of people
to get her up and out.

322
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,913
But I'm the only one
she trusts.

323
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,555
She'll blow hot and cold on you,
John. She always does.

324
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,513
- You ought to be careful.
- I get 90 pounds a year.

325
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,430
Plus another 70 for a pile
of old tartan I'd be wearin' anyway.

326
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,596
That's as much as a page
of the back stair gets,

327
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,678
and that's a job for toffs.

328

## [Bagpipes Playing]

329
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,555
I'm Her Majesty's
Highland servant!

330
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,069
Indoors and out.

331
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,475
There's no stoppin' me now.

333
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,034
Oh, God, the pipes.

334
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,551
- What are those?
- What?

335
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,355
- Those over there. There.
- Ah... [Speaking Scottish]

336
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,234
[Speaking Scottish] How can I
possibly say that with a straight face?

337
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,190
I'm thinking of publishing
my Highland journals.

338
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,517
- Are they worth readin'?
- I'm told so.

339
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,791
- By whom?
- Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me
they're charming.

340
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,990
What does he know
about the Highlands?

341
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,476
He has been attending
at Balmoral for many years.

342
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,478
Well, that hardly makes him
an expert.

343
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,037
His remarks were directed at the quality
of writing, not at subject.

344
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,958
I don't groom a horse
to have it admired by others.

345
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,991
I groom it
because it needs grooming.

346
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,669
I do not do it for others,
but Ponsonby thinks they are good.

347
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,633
Just say what you have to say, woman!
What other people think
shouldn't matter to you.

348
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,228
Of course I shall say
what I have to say. I always do.

349
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,477
Well, if it's a good opinion
you're lookin' for,

350
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,670
he's the very man
to oblige you.

351
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:29,158
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating
was their literary merit,

352
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,556
a skill not intimately associated
with a knowledge of grooming.

353
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,077
Literary appreciation does not begin
and end with Tennyson.

354
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,191
[Sighing]

355
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,797
I mention you in them.

356
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,395
In particular, the occasion
when Albert was alive.

357
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,713
The royal carriage overturned
during a storm,

358
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,752
and you demonstrated
such loyal service...

359
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,952
in returning the Queen
and princesses safely to Balmoral.

360
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,158
For friendship.

361
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,278
She'll be gone between 8:00
and 6:00 on Friday...

362
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,039
visiting the Grant family
at Glasalt.

363
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,355
In order to make the journey
there and back in one day,

364
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,755
she must have no distractions
the night before.

365
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,714
She'll take a light supper
in her private drawing room
and retire early.

366
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,990
She'll need to sign dispatches
before she retires.

367
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,236
That can wait
until the weekend.

368
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,999
- They're important papers!
- It can wait! Anything else?

369
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,714
Are you sure Her Majesty
is up to such a long journey?

370
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,229
She's only just recovered
from a severe head cold.

371
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,069
If I didn't think she was up to it,
I wouldn't let her go, would I?

372
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,280
Surely it is for the gentleman
to decide when to stop.

373
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,675
It is a disgusting habit.
It should be discouraged.

374
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,951
- Yes, but isn't midnight
a little excessive?
- It's quite late enough.

375
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,594
But, Mama, the room was built
expressly for that purpose.

376
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,429
It has been a smoking room by tradition
ever since Father built it.

377
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,632
Brown's responsibilities
are onerous enough already.

378
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,150
He has far too much to do during the day
without having to stay up all night...

379
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,475
waiting for you
to go to bed.

380
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,239
The smoking room will be closed
and the lights put out at 12:00.

381
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,193
- Mama.
- And that is my last word
on the matter.

382
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,834
Well, I'm sorry, but I really
do think it's intolerable...

383
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,428
the gentleman of the house
should be dictated to by a servant.

384
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,074
It's the Queen's decision.

385
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,192
I beg your pardon?
Mama!

386
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,029
I think you should go now.
You've tired your mother enough.

387
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,996
[Brown] There's really no
need for this, you know.

388
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,590
- I'll not have her
seein' it like it is.
- It's the last thing she expects.

389
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,190
That's as may be, John, but I just
wish she'd warned us she was comin'.

390
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,231
Had she warned ya,

391
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,591
you'd be throwin' water on the fire
and hiding knitting under cushions.

392
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,473
- You can't stop a wife
from bein' house-proud.
- [Chuckling]

393
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,350
- All right, show her in.
- Fine.

394
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,437
They're ready
for you now, ma'am.

395
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,791
- I hope they didn't go
to any trouble, John.
- Ah, well.

396
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,155
Ma'am.

397
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,078
Mr Grant, how good it is
to see you.

398
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,919
- Your Majesty.
- Mrs Grant.

399
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,316
- How's your knee?
Has the pain eased a little?
- Not so bad, ma'am.

400
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,237
Good.

401
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,517
Oh, and here are
Douglas and John.

402
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,313
Haven't you grown?

403
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,635
Growing all the time, ma'am.

404
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,513
- Would you care to sit, ma'am?
- Thank you.

405
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,555
I know that.

406
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,035
That's Cairn Lochan.

407
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,596
- We picnicked there once,
John, did we not?
- Aye, we did, indeed, ma'am.

408
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,793
[Chattering]

409
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,150
Thank you so much.

410
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,316
Ah, the greasy pole.

411
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,352
Don't be facetious, dear.
Remember your position.

412
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,472
It's my position
I'm thinking of.

413
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,795
I see the Prince of Wales
is here.

414
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,593
I hope he's got
his mama's permission.

415
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,553
- Oh, Salisbury.
- Madam.

416
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,754
Why is the Queen
penny-wise and pound foolish?

417
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,713
Because she looks
after the Browns...

418
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,071
and lets the sovereigns
take care of themselves.

419
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,351
And in your opinion,
is she foolish?

420
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,679
- Well... What I mean to say...
It's hardly right, is it?
- What?

421
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,315
Well, the Queen
and Mr Brown.

422
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,672
La superstition met le monde
entier en flammes.

423
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,917
I beg your pardon?

424
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,477
Has anyone seen
this, uh, Mr Brown?

425
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,750
He is her personal servant,
I believe.

426
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,677
He follows her
wherever she goes.

427
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,316
He would hardly make a very good
personal servant if he did not.

428
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,237
Excuse me.

429
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,151
It's not my best china.

430
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,717
I mean, it is my best china now, but
the family set got stolen last summer.

431
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,752
-I'm sorry.
-Of course, it was no one on the estate.

432
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,314
More like one of the lads
out from Braemar.

433
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,237
Or further even.

434
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,437
I'll fetch the salt.

435
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,314
Mr Disraeli.

436
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,796
- Ma'am.
- Your Royal Highness,
what a pleasure to see you here.

437
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,718
Have you met Mr Lyle?
He's in sugar.

438
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,354
I don't think I've had
that pleasure.

439
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,233
Mr Lyle,
the fascinating thing...

440
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,794
[Woman Laughing]

441
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,717
No doubt you've heard
the rumours.

442
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,990
I take no account
of gossip, Your Highness.

443
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,271
My concern is the reputation
of the monarchy.

444
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,197
Of course.

445
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,550
I fear the influence
he has on her.

446
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,910
The man's word
is not to be credited.

447
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,555
He is an arriviste
of the very lowest water.

448
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,309
You know, she's having
a bust cast of him...

449
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,034
in Nero Marquino marble.

450
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,108
I'd talk to her myself,
but she won't listen to me.

451
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,358
She must be persuaded by someone
she respects to abandon this...

452
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,277
ridiculous favouritism...

453
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,233
before...

454
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,191
a situation develops.

455
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,311
A situation?

456
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,079
Look, I don't imagine you
frequent the republican clubs,

457
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,430
but the fact that
neither you nor I are members...

458
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,109
should not blind us
to the significance of their existence.

459
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,468
The Tory party
has always been our party.

460
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,875
I'm flattered you think so.

461
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,036
I tell you, if we don't
stick together on this,

462
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,836
you could very well find yourself
first president's opposition.

I really don't think we can overstate
the seriousness of this.

466
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,196
What did he want?

467
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,392
To know
when he'll be King.

468
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,273
So Grant and myself
are riding over Lochnagar...

469
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,311
on the worst
imaginable night.

470
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,716
The rain is coming down in sheets,
and all we can think about...

471
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,912
is gettin' home
for a wee drink.

472
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,999
Suddenly, through the gloom,
Grant sees a couple of poachers,

473
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,796
gives me the shout, and we were off,
gallopin' down the hill after them.

474
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,150
We chased them right down
to the loch side.

475
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,751
He got there first, leaps off
his horse like a man possessed,

476
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,316
grabs the two unfortunate men
by the throat against the stack.

477
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,671
He was shoutin'. He was swearin'
at the top of his voice.

478
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,030
He looks into the eyes
of the smallest one, and he says,

479
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,072
"Why are you poachin'
on royal land?"

480
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,475
And the poor wee man
looks up at him,

481
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,477
completely terrified
and says,

482
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,558
"Because we've come up
in the world."

483
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,835
[Brown]
Whoa!

484
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,952
Your Majesty,
thank goodness you're safe.

485
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,915
I'll have a bath prepared
immediately. I recommend
MacDonald's African embrocation.

Ah, pipe down, man.
The woman's fine.

487
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,633
We stayed a little longer
than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.

488
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,070
- It was most agreeable.
- We were expecting you
to return by 6:00.

489
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,159
- Now I'm back.
- And we had a wee nip of whisky.

490
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,714
- To keep out the cold.
- Aye.

Distinct flushing
around the cheeks.

494
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,797
She was drunk,
I tell you.

495
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,717
No, she wasn't.

496
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,989
- Surely not.
- Don't even think it.

## [Bagpipes Continue]

502
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,994
[Gasping]

503
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,917
Thank you.

504
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,912
- Which one is he?
- The tall one.

505
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,793
- Got him?
- Aye.

506
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,673
- [Chattering]
- [Man] I think it's over here.

507
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,749
What is it, John?

508
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,597
I won't be long.

509
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,355
Where'd he go?
I've lost him.

510
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:48,672
Don't know if there's much worth
writing about. Hard to tell.

511
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,553
Is this close enough
for you, boys?

512
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,989
Go on! Get out!

513
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,509
Go on! On your way!

514
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,676
- Back where you belong!
- Come on!

515
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,870
You filthy scavengers!

516
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,197
Leave her alone!
You hear?

517
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,953
If I catch
the miserable by-blow...

518
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,799
who told those people
the Queen's whereabouts,

519
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,869
I'll cut his balls off and hang them
out to dry on Jock Wemyss, so I will.

520
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,231
What happens to John Brown
is his business,

521
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,591
but the Queen's security
will never be compromised!

522
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,714
- What action...
- You'll talk when I'm finished.

523
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,998
That kind of disloyalty will not be
tolerated in this house. Is that clear?

524
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,198
- Is that clear?
- [All] Yes, Mr Brown.

525
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,312
[Dr Jenner]
"Court circular: Balmoral.

526
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,874
"On Tuesday,
Mr John Brown attended...

527
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,709
"a display of sheep dipping
by local farmers.

528
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,593
"On Wednesday,
he attended a seance,

529
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,917
"where he was pleased to listen
to a recital of 'Auld Lang Syne'...

530
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,191
"by Mr Robert Burns himself.

531
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,517
"On Thursday, Mr John Brown
walked on the slopes,

532
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,757
"accompanied by family
and friend.

533
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,235
"At tea,
he partook of haggis,

534
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,555
"and in the evening,
he attended a recital...

535
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,673
"of bagpipe music
through the ages.

536
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,476
After a light supper,
Mr John Brown retired early."

537
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,595
If I find you had anything to do
with this, I'll have you sacked.

538
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,109
I believe that decision
rests with Her Majesty.

539
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,196
Don't think
I can't persuade her.

540
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,436
I don't doubt the Queen
was highly amused.

541
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,630
She's always had
a very healthy sense of humour.

542
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,194
This is a slur
on her good name.

543
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,073
Inasmuch as the article
is about yourself,

544
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,636
I think you must now accept
that the public has a right
to its interest in you.

545
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,591
Nobody has rights
over me.

546
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,509
We are, all of us,
subject to forces...

547
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,234
beyond our control,
Mr Brown.

548
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,157
Even you.

549
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,874
You'll regret saying that.

550
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,837
[Chattering]

551
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,509
[Man]
Order!

552
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,916
Order! Order!
Order!

553
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:35,033
The results of the vote to the motion
to disestablish the Irish Church.

554
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,236
Order!

555
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:44,029
Ayes to the right: 313.

556
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,596
Nos to the left: 265.

557
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,517
Mr Speaker!

558
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,474
I table a motion
in furtherance of the bill...

559
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,797
to disestablish the monarchy!

560
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,630
[Disraeli]
We're going to lose.

561
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,550
Gladstone's got his party facing the
same way for the first time in years.

562
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,716
We need help.

563
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,751
[Sighing]
Where is the old girl?

564
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,031
- Who?
- Mrs Brown.

565
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,869
It's questionable whether there's any
advantage to be had from that direction.

566
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,231
- She's never been less popular.
- Aye, in the press, perhaps,

567
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:39,399
but she's sold more copies of her
Highland journal in three months...

568
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,717
than Punch will ever sell
in a year.

569
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,435
- It's time to wheel her out.
- She's refusing to leave Balmoral.

570
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,154
Oh, what's the excuse
this time?

571
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,829
Princess Louise
is too ill to move.

572
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,034
Frankly, the Queen is rather upset
about the recent spate of bad publicity.

573
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,597
- You're smiling.
- Oh, um, trying to imagine
"rather upset."

574
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,075
Forgive me, gentlemen.
I'm late.

575
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,555
Not at all, Dean. It's very good
of you to spare the time.

576
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,117
- I came as quickly as I could.
- You've seen the latest cartoon
in Punch, I take it.

577
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,754
I beg your pardon? Oh.

578
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,394
One of our madder brethren
in the House was calling for...

579
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,193
the disestablishment
of the monarchy.

580
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,754
- Good Lord!
- Oh, I'm sure it won't come to that.

581
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,838
It is now a matter
for each man's conscience.

582
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,520
I was just telling Lord Stanley
how vital it is...

583
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,155
that the nation should feel the visible
influence of the sovereign...

584
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,909
as a reminder that Parliament...
well, indeed, my own ministry...

585
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,837
depends on the will
of the Queen.

586
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:43,080
I couldn't agree with you more,
but I am only Dean of Windsor.

587
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,034
- I don't understand what...
- We hear from Balmoral...

588
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,072
that Mr Brown has been
interesting Her Majesty...

589
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,876
in some of the forms of worship
associated with...

590
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,879
low-church Presbyterian.

591
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,798
What can we do?

592
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,480
Oh, several things.

593
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,234
- Read it.
- Again?

594
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,316
Read it!

595
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,910
"The Times wishes to join the rest
of Her Majesty's loyal subjects...

596
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,998
"in expressing its deep joy
at the news...

597
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,270
that the Queen is soon
to come out of mourning."

598
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,709
- Who told them that?
- I have no idea.

599
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,628
- Why not?
- l... Forgive me, ma'am,
I am no wiser than yourself.

600
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,513
No one should think themselves
wiser than me!

601
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,710
It is not for any
of the Queen's subjects...

602
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,479
to presume to tell Her Majesty
when and where she should
come out of mourning.

603
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,912
It is the Queen's sorrow
that keeps her secluded.

604
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,032
It is her overwhelming amount
of work and responsibility...

605
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,799
work that she feels will soon
wear her out entirely.

606
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,151
- Your Majesty...
- Is it not enough that she is
uncheered and unguided...

607
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,511
that she should also have to
suffer these malicious rumours?

608
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,390
I am not a fool.

609
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,717
I know there are those in the
establishment too afraid to attack me,

610
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,354
so they attack
my dearest friends.

611
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,710
Sometimes...

612
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,549
I feel Brown is all I have left
of Albert.

613
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,073
And now they attack Brown too.

614
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,670
I will not give him up
to them!

615
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,870
[Clock Bells Chiming]

616
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,951
- I wish to see my mother.
- She's busy.

617
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,436
- Then convey her a message.
- She's away to Windsor tomorrow.
Talk to her there.

618
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,869
Tell her the Prince of Wales
wishes to speak with her urgently...

619
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,797
about matters
concerning the press.

620
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,480
Are you deaf
as well as stupid?

621
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,909
What did you say?

622
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:44,511
I said, "Are you deaf
as well as stupid?"

623
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,871
Do you know
who you address, sir?

624
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,110
Whom you address.

625
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:56,360
- Get out of my way!
- Why don't you just leave us alone?

626
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,195
[Man]
Where do you want this one, sir?

627
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,595
[Chattering]

628
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,800
- You, boy! What's your business here?
- Under-porter, sir.

629
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,876
Well, don't stand
where you shouldn't.

630
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,197
[Horse Neighing]

631
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,760
[Bell Tolling]

632
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,195
Hey, Barney.

633
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,949
- Mr Brown, sir.
- It's a cold one out there
tonight, Barney.

634
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,196
Yeah.

635
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,596
Have you looked at this hoof?
She was limpin'. I think
there might be a stone in it.

636
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,188
- Ye-Yeah, l-I d-did.
- Good, man.

637
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,039
- Then she's all right?
- Yeah.

638
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,071
Good. She's a good girl.

639
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,476
Aren't ya?
Yeah, she's a lovely girl.

640
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,068
- And you know the Queen's
riding her tomorrow?
- Yeah.

641
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,873
You all right, Barney?

642
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,317
Oh, aye.

643
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,033
Come on.
Come on, you.

644
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,475
Come on. Okay. There.

645
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,353
- [Gasping]
- [Men Laughing]

646
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,192
[Doors Opening]

647
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,997
Well?

648
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,837
Mr Brown is unable
to attend today.

649
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,076
Why?

650
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,909
- I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
- Unwell?

651
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,474
I understand
he was in a fight.

652
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:55,119
- Has he been hurt?
- I believe not, ma'am.

653
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,913
I understand...

654
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,679
he'd had rather too much
to drink.

655
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,152
You may go.

656
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,112
[Gasping]
And she sent no word down?

657
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,515
They said you were drunk.

658
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,038
Why don't you tell her
the truth?

659
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,110
She'll think it's her fault
for keepin' me.

660
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:02,269
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm getting dressed.

661
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,393
- You've got three broken ribs.
- I've got my duties to attend to.

662
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,671
Don't be an idiot. You're in
no fit state to go anywhere.

663
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,429
- She'll be worried about me.
- She'll get over it.

664
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:18,031
[Grunting]
I can't let her down now, Archie.

665
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,596
And when was the last time she put
herself out for you?

666
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,280
Look, John, whatever
she says to you now,

667
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,197
in the end,
you're a servant.

668
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,959
I am much more than that.

669
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,356
She may say that to you, but the woman
can say what she wants, can't she?

670
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,074
- Just watch your tongue!
- Come on, man.

671
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,997
I'm tellin' you
what you already know.

672
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,510
- You know nothing about her.
- When are you gonna see it, John?

673
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,393
She doesn't give
a damn about you!

674
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,031
From the Queen.

675
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,073
"My lips me give a message better
of Christmas love...

676
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,997
"than e'en this letter.

677
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:57,750
To my best friend, J.B.
From his best friend, V.R."

678
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,836
Best friend!

679
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:03,191
- Aye.
- She means it!

680
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,197
She'll drop you.

681
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,357
When she's done with you,
she'll drop you.

682
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,631
- Get out.
- [Sighing]

683
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,716
Get out.

684
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,637
Get out.
Get out!

685
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,951
Out!

686
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,358
[Sir Henry] ...to be followed
by a visit from Lady Bridport.

687
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,189
She is keen to secure a place
for her niece as maid of honour.

688
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:39,950
- I'm tired.
- Um, there is one other matter.

689
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:43,277
- What is it?
- I have a letter, ma'am.

690
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,231
From whom?

691
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:49,433
From Princess Helena and other members
of the royal family.

692
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,758
My family is quite capable of
communicating with the Queen in person.

693
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,631
What do they want?

694
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,436
They are demanding the dismissal
of Mr Brown on grounds of drunkenness.

695
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,875
You wish
to see me, ma'am?

696
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,198
My husband tried always
to make me think more subtly.

697
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,037
Of course,
he taught me so much,

698
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:50,277
and I can never repay
my debt to him...

699
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,709
or the love I feel
even now.

700
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,514
But in truth,

701
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,835
I think I am someone...

702
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,269
who can only feel things...

703
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,476
when they are alive to me.

704
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:15,036
And for that reason,
I know I do not have a subtle mind.

705
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,594
I know that.

706
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,518
But I work hard,
and I...

707
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,551
try to do my duty.

708
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,151
However,

709
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,077
I have noticed of late...

710
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:38,874
that...
my feelings of grief...

711
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,677
are not so strong,

712
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,391
and I find myself leaning...

713
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,030
more...

714
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,469
on the comfort
of living friends.

715
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,191
Friends close to me now.

716
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,396
Your Majesty,

717
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:09,193
a settled resignation...

718
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,273
is more lasting proof
of affection...

719
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,197
than active grief.

720
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,995
If the Good Lord sees fit
to bring one into contact...

721
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:25,875
with... congenial
fellow beings,

722
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,912
one need not analyze
one's reaction too deeply.

723
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,635
To allow oneself
to be comforted...

724
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,751
by someone else...

725
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:43,352
need not imply disloyalty
to the memory of the loved one.

726
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,831
Sir Henry?

727
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,354
Please tell the princess
and other signatories to this letter...

728
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,630
that the Queen will not
be dictated to...

729
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,558
or made to alter
in any way...

730
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,911
what she has found
to answer for her comfort.

731
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,679
- Do I make myself clear?
- Ma'am.

732
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,190
You may go.

733
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,197
I would like to get down.

734
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,637
[Groaning]

735
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,350
I was told
you were in a fight.

736
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,277
Yes, ma'am.

737
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,956
Has someone seen
to those bruises?

738
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,957
Yes, ma'am.

739
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,997
Ma'am.

740
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:13,189
Having considered
my position here in court,

741
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:18,189
I have come to the conclusion
that in Your Majesty's
best interests I should resign.

742
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,311
I do not accept.

743
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,432
I had foreseen
that you would not.

744
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,036
But Your Majesty
should understand...

745
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,237
that I will not
be changed in this.

746
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,557
- I leave for Deeside...
- The Queen forbids it.

747
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,154
I cannot allow it...

748
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,077
because I cannot live
without you.

749
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:55,033
Without you, I cannot
find the strength...

750
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,356
to be who I must be.

751
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,591
Please.

752
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,270
Promise me you won't
let them send me back.

753
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,591
I promise.

754
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:42,712
[Disraeli] Yesterday,
Gladstone talked for three hours...

755
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,195
on the Irish Church bill.

756
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:50,394
I am as guilty as the rest
of underestimating his reforming zeal.

757
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:54,399
Tory days may be numbered,
but I fancy there yet remains...

758
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,478
one last hope
of deliverance.

759
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:01,195
Wheresoever the blame lies,
we must now close ranks...

760
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:04,790
and defend
Mrs Brown's England.

761
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,630
As for my interminable journey...

762
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,753
to the land of Calvin,
oatcakes and sulphur,

763
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,429
no prime minister
made greater sacrifice...

764
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,790
than attempting
to run the country...

765
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:21,912
six hundred miles
north of civilization.

766
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:44,438
## [Singing]

767
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:24,754
# Embracing... ##
How dare the Irish
break with the Anglicans!

768
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:29,749
If Albert were alive today,
he would never allow the crown
to give up church patronage.

769
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,711
No.

770
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,594
The Irish must be told very firmly
to stay exactly where they are.

771
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,754
It's the thin end
of the wedge, Mr Disraeli.

772
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:45,395
Next you will be telling me that
the crown no longer governs this nation.

773
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:50,196
Your Majesty remains
at the very epicentre of governance.

774
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:54,359
As for your people,
look no further than the sales...

775
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,311
of your
Highland journals...

776
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:59,830
to see in what affection
the nation holds their Queen.

777
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:04,317
Why, you sell even more copies
than Mr Dickens.

778
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,034
But I lack your prose,
Mr Disraeli.

779
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,232
Oh.

780
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,955
Of course,
I understand your concern.

781
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:17,390
You miss your people,
and they miss you.

782
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,951
- Then they may read about me.
- Indeed.

783
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,310
And for that, they are
eternally grateful.

784
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,989
- Is that not enough?
- In so many ways.

785
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,715
And yet, it is...

786
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,593
your presence they crave.

787
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,631
A figurehead.

788
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,795
I never thought to be bullied
by you, Mr Disraeli.

789
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,876
You, I thought,
understood a widow's grief.

790
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,991
Forgive me, ma'am.

791
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,476
I cannot speak for the nation,
only for myself.

792
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:53,276
As prime minister,
I confess I miss your presence.

793
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,039
But that is an expression
of my own selfish desires,

794
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,913
and I should not
burden you with it.

795
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,158
I stay here
because I am happy.

796
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,396
Is that
such a terrible crime?

797
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,034
No, ma'am.

798
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,671
Time for your walk.

799
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:32,998
- This is my good John Brown.
- Yes.

800
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,509
I've asked him to show you
a little of Highland life...

801
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,471
while you're with us
at Balmoral.

802
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,592
What brings you here?

803
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:44,998
A man can refuse only
so many invitations from his Queen.

804
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,509
It was remiss of me
not to come earlier.

805
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,596
And what do you know
of the Highlands?

806
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,676
[Chuckles]
I am a blank sheet.

807
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,598
- Do you hunt?
- Mmm, occasionally.

808
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,790
Daresay we could
have you taught.

809
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,354
To shoot, perhaps,
but not to kill.

810
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,755
If you hunt,
you hunt to kill.

811
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,310
Well, then,
I'll do my best.

812
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:47,389
[Thunder Rumbling]

813
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:53,279
Always remember, keep it
very tight to your shoulder,

814
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,994
absorb the kick
with your body,

815
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:58,111
aim for the head... bang!

816
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,037
Imagine it's Gladstone.

817
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,037
Yes, quite.

819
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,716
Thank you.

- Back door, west wing?
- Checked and locked, sir.

- Side door, west wing?
- Checked and locked, sir.

- Front door, west wing?
- Checked and locked, sir.

- Side door, east wing?
- Checked and locked...

824
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,159
- Louder, girl!
- Checked and locked, sir.

825
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:23,955
- Kitchen, lower house?
- Checked and locked. Sir.

- Back and upper corridors?
- Checked and locked, sir.

Front door.
Checked and locked.

828
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,838
Did you see any
Irish assassins today, Mr Brown?

829
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:48,274
We heard the ponies
were Fenian sympathizers.

830
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,750
Or was it the stag?

831
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,348
There's not a soul in here...

832
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:58,870
who cares about that
wee woman's safety except me!

833
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,390
She would be dead
in a ditch...

834
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,795
if I wasn't here
to look out for her!

835
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,919
- You hear that?
- [Laughing]

What's this?

839
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,709
It's a diary.

840

- Be careful who sees it.
- What do you take me for?

841
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:12,593
- You should have someone look at ya.
- I'm all right.

842
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:15,678
Just need to rest up
a wee while.

843
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,876
[Groaning]

844
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,797
Oh.

845
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,677
You don't need to stay.

846
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,712
The place is a mess.

847
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,150
[Brown Moans]
Can't move to tidy.

848
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:34,398
- That's what the maids are for.
- I don't need some prattler
goin' through my things.

849
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,068
Why don't ya give yourself
a rest, John?

850
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,158
She's other people
to look out for her.

851
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,111
She needs me, Archie.

852
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,958
Can't do without me.
Told me to my face.

853
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,230
[Inhaling]

854
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,555
[Exhaling]
How can I stop now?

855
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:05,831
[Gasping]

856
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:18,511
- You sent for me?
- I've been called back to London.

857
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,949
My last day.

858
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,878
I thought I might take
a walk up Lochnagar.

859
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:16,035
[Disraeli] "Princes and lords
are but the breath of kings.

860
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:19,948
A honest man's
the noblest work of God."

861
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,310
You must miss
such magnificent views.

862
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,749
I don't think about it.

863
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,792
Oh. Forgive me.

864
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,718
I've called you out, and you
should have been resting.

865
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,599
- I'm fine.
- But you are injured.

866
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:47,032
- It's nothin'.
- Still, someone must attend to it.

867
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:51,392
- Your wife should not have let you out.
- I'm not married.

868
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,195
Oh.

869
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:58,232
- [Grunting]
- This is the top.

870
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:01,113
[Sighing]

871
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:05,233
I confess I sometimes feel
as if I'm not married myself.

872
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,510
I see my wife so little.

873
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,876
But I'm forgetting
the rewards.

874
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:15,193
The look on their faces
when one walks into a room...

875
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,914
still gives one
a ridiculous thrill.

876
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,600
- Well, I wouldn't know.
- Oh, surely.

877
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,836
What I do,
I do for my Queen.

878
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,157
Was there never ambition?

879
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,037
Maybe, once.

880
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,469
Oh. I envy you.

881
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:38,195
- Why?
- Oh, to have achieved one's ambition...

882
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,437
or to have reconciled oneself
to its limits...

883
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,791
is a lifetime's work.

884
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,480
- I do what I do.
- For Her Majesty.

885
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,229
- Aye.
- But yourself? What about John Brown?

886
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:56,118
I told ya.
I serve my Queen.

887
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,754
And no other aspiration?

888
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,711
To see her safe.

889
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,115
You will not be unaware...

890
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:10,232
of the threat now posed
by the republicanism?

891
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,510
Why do you think
I've kept her here?

892
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,393
Ah, but therein lies
the paradox.

893
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:19,354
It is her very isolation
that encourages the malcontents.

894
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:22,233
The longer she is away,
the stronger they become,

895
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,909
and who, honestly, can provide
security against that?

896
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,151
However many doors
you lock,

897
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,191
someone will always get in.

898
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,958
Even here.

899
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,271
So?

900
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,994
The truth is, the Queen
would be safer...

901
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:43,669
doing her duty and returning
south to her public.

902
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:48,157
John Bull loves her,
and John Bull is her best defence.

903
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:54,076
Her mind is set.
You'll never change it now.

904
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,270
She trusts you, John.

905
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,111
[Sighing]

906
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,191
They don't see it.

907
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,151
See what?

908
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,396
The danger. I keep tellin' them,
but they don't see it.

909
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:20,799
- They're not as watchful as you.
- They're too busy
thinking about themselves.

910
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,512
A greasy pole.

911
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,438
- No loyalty.
- No, um,

912
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,279
Iove.

913
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:36,950
I promised to protect her...
from people like you.

914
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:41,596
[Chuckling]
For once in my life, I'm not the issue.

915
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,998
- She'll never understand it.
- Oh, in time she will.

916
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,674
She'll think
I've betrayed her.

917
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,429
But others will know that you
acted for the greater good.

918
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,998
I received a letter today
from Mr Disraeli.

919
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,833
Parliament are calling
for my return to public duties.

920
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,431
He insists the country
expects me to preside...

921
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,596
over the opening
of the new session.

922
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:02,110
I refuse to offer sustenance
to enable his weakening grip.

923
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:06,313
Besides, you know how much
I would hate it.

924
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,636
It frightens me.

925
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,311
John?

926
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,479
We can't always have
what we wish.

927
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,310
"Duty"?
You talk about "duty"?

928
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,716
When duty and safety are served
by the same ends, then, aye, I do!

929
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,479
I cannot believe you're saying this.
You who I've relied on all this time?

930
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,034
- Have I ever lied before?
- You stand there and tell me
it is my duty!

931
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,469
- After all you promised me?
- I've broken no promise!

932
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,830
You're forcing me to do
the very thing you know I'd fear most.

933
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:46,349
For God's sake, woman,
I'm tryin' to see you safe!

934
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,869
I will not hear any more
about my safety!

935
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,230
You made me a promise,
and now you've broken it!

936
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,352
When I took you out riding,
come rain or shine,

937
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,311
because I knew
it was right for you,

938
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:00,319
when I got the bairns off your back
just to give you a bit o' peace,

939
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:03,910
when I saw you safe
from home to home when
you didn't even know if I was there,

940
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,076
all I ever thought about
was you!

941
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:10,079
- Then why send me back to them?
- Because I have to!

942
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,673
Will you not listen to me,
woman?

943
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:25,436
Do not presume to talk
to your Queen in that manner.

944
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:41,108
Dr Jenner,
I feel unwell.

945
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,675
I shall retire
to my chamber.

946
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,473
- Please attend me presently.
- Ma'am.

947
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:19,078
[All]
Ma'am.

948
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:47,039
May I say how glad I am to see
Your Majesty so much recovered.

949
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,271
Where is my son?

950
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,719
Prince Albert
is at Windsor, ma'am.

951
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:03,036
Why is he not here?

952
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,588
- He is sick, ma'am.
- Then why are you not with him?

953
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:15,479
You ordered all members of the royal
family to attend you at Balmoral.

954
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,077
What's the matter with him?

955
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,269
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.

956
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:32,791
No. You are mistaken.

957
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:36,310
Prince Albert, my husband,
had typhoid fever.

958
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,396
I asked what was wrong
with my son.

959
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:42,069
The same, Your Majesty.

960
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:46,552
Why was I not informed?

961
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,910
I did not consider it wise
in the circumstances...

962
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,837
to tax your nerves.

963
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,994
How ill is he?

964
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,359
Alex?

965
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,992
He is not well, ma'am.

966
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:13,318
I must go to him.
We must leave at once.

967
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:22,876
[Chattering]

968
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,998
[Chattering]

969
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:43,949
[Watch Ticking]

970
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,719
Better.

971
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:08,272
If the Good Lord should see fit
to spare my son,

972
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,790
I will order a Mass
to be celebrated at St. George's.

973
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,794
The people must share
with their Queen...

974
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:19,514
her prayers and hopes
for their future King.

975
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,998
The Queen will be riding
to St. George's on the 5th.

976
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:34,998
I recommend Her Majesty use a covered
carriage and a full horse guard.

977
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,395
In the event of any disturbance,
I will insure...

978
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:41,115
I will ride to St. George's
in an open carriage.

979
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:43,993
It is time the Queen
was seen by her public.

980
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:39,949
[People Cheering]

981
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,794
[Cheering]

982
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,037
No!

983
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,192
[Albert]
And so there he is, Arthur O'Conner,

984
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:27,075
all seven stone of the man,
paddling madly towards us
through a sea of horse guards,

985
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,509
waving something that
looks vaguely like a pen!

986
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:33,076
- [Laughing]
- I thought he must be one of
Mother's ardent readership...

987
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,714
in search of
the royal indenture.

988
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,637
[Laughter]

989
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,435
I believe I saw him first,
and then I alerted Brown.

990
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:45,872
I'm not convinced that he wasn't
taking a snooze on top of the steps.

991
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,436
- [Laughing]
- So we had our man pinned down,

992
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:52,313
and I must say that Brown
acquitted himself admirably.

993
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:54,510
Of course, the gun
turned out to be a fake,

994
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:58,030
but, uh, well, you know,
nonetheless it was, um...
[Clears Throat]

995
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:00,913
- Yes, um, well done.
- [Guests Murmur In Agreement]

996
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:07,669
I intend Brown to be rewarded
with a special medal cast in gold.

997
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:11,913
It will be called
the "Devoted Service Medal."

998
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,998
- [Albert] Mm.
- [Applause]

999
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,911
[Clinking]

1000
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:21,117
A toast.

1001
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,750
[Albert]
Victoria Regina!

1002
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,474
[Guests]
Victoria Regina!

1003
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,915
I saw your face there
as well, Sir Henry.

1004
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:41,919
I think that you were sneaking
a bit behind the carriage.

1005
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:44,838
[Albert Continues Talking,
Indistinct]

1006
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:47,838
[Guests Talking,
Laughing]

1007
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:58,435
[Disraeli]
The people of England have expressed,

1008
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:01,757
in a manner which
cannot be mistaken,

1009
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:06,749
that they will uphold
the ancient monarchy of England.

1010
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:12,000
Go to your homes.
Teach them these truths.

1011
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:16,636
A land of liberty,
of prosperity...

1012
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,876
of power...

1013
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,468
and of glory!

1014
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:25,388
[Cheering]

1015
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:42,158
[Brown] We should not live
in expectation of contentment.

1016
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:48,310
Fifteen years of vigilance
will not guarantee peace of mind.

1017
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:52,558
Yesterday, intruders were again
reported in the south wing.

1018
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:57,117
I believe my prompt arrival
may have averted any crisis,

1019
01:31:57,240 --> 01:32:00,152
but it was
a timely reminder.

1020
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,874
It is a great comfort to me
that my efforts...

1021
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:08,233
in securing the Queen's safety
over the years have not been in vain.

1022
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:12,194
Certainly Her Majesty sends me no word
that she is dissatisfied,

1023
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:16,108
and I feel sure that
if she were unhappy,

1024
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:19,630
she would have found the occasion
to speak to me in person,

1025
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:22,638
- [Clattering]
- as she has so often done in the past.

1026
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:25,911
- [Knocking]
- What is it?

1027
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,917
[Man]
North woods, sir!

1028
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:46,717
[Thunderclap]

1029
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:25,791
God save the Queen!

1030
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:28,678
[Gunshot Echoing]

1031
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:11,151
How long has he been
this sick?

1032
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,111
A few days, ma'am.

1033
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,511
Why was I not told earlier?

1034
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,877
[Knocking]

1035
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,553
You should never have gone out
in such foul weather.

1036
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:59,320
Someone has to look after ya.

1037
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:06,957
It could have been someone.

1038
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,910
It was before.

1039
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:14,873
Yes. Yes, it was.

1040
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:26,033
My ministers are
as impertinent as ever.

1041
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:29,709
Dispatches so numerous
they come in a trunk.

1042
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:33,833
Sometimes, I do believe,
they will never stop.

1043
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:36,076
Endless letters.

1044
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:49,516
I know I've not always been...

1045
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,748
the loyal friend
that you deserve, John.

1046
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,199
And here, even now, I'm...

1047
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:03,437
feeling desperate
with the thought of losing you.

1048
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:09,915
Don't be silly, woman.

1049
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:11,837
[Gasping]

1050
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:19,358
[Water Splashing]

1051
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:38,431
[Sniffling]

1052
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:45,437
Not too near.

1053
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:51,909
[Sobbing]

1054
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:15,751
[Dr Jenner]
Cause of death was pneumonia.

1055
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:18,394
[Sir Henry]
Not too protracted, I hope.

1056
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:21,353
A few days.

1057
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:23,311
When he heard,
the Prince of Wales...

1058
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:27,115
threw the bust over the wall
of the north tower.

1059
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:31,518
Took four hours
to gather the fragments.

1060
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:34,518
Queen wishes to publish
an account of him.

1061
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:36,949
Dear, oh, dear.

1062
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:40,470
- We think she can be dissuaded.
- Hmm.

1063
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,955
Have you had a glance
at the diary?

1064
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:46,072
- Yes.
- Quite.

1065
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:48,634
I think I best
take it back.

1066
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:51,228
Oh, of course.

1067
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,316
Where did you find it,
by the way?

1068
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:57,035
Oh, some young page was boasting
about having seen it.

1069
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:59,469
- Lucky.
- [Chuckles]

1070
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:02,398
Well, no rest
for the wicked, Henry.

1071
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,553
No. Indeed.
