00:31:38,788 --> 00:31:40,323
Then what's this
fucking red light?

542
00:31:40,324 --> 00:31:42,274
I mean, it's
a camera, but--

543
00:31:58,274 --> 00:32:01,411
Gary: Well, looks like we've
found all this guy's shit.

544
00:32:01,412 --> 00:32:04,180
Yeah, there's a ton
of shit in here.

545
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:05,383
All right, you go that way.

546
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:08,033
- I'm gonna go over here.
- All right.

547
00:32:23,033 --> 00:32:24,234
Gary: Found it!

548
00:32:24,235 --> 00:32:25,402
You got it?

549
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:27,404
Yeah, yeah.

550
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:28,913
All right,
let me get over there.

551
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:38,447
Which one is it?

552
00:32:38,448 --> 00:32:40,450
I don't know, man.

553
00:32:40,451 --> 00:32:43,052
He said we'd fucking
know, but I don't,

554
00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:47,322
so... uh... Get a bag,
and let's just take

555
00:32:47,323 --> 00:32:49,893
all this shit up to the car.

556
00:32:49,894 --> 00:32:51,359
All right, let me--
let me find something.

557
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,829
We're just gon' take all of it?

558
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,897
Yeah, take all of it.

559
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:56,175
Fuck.

560
00:33:04,175 --> 00:33:06,376
Okay, this crate.

561
00:33:06,377 --> 00:33:08,944
This crate right here.

562
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,481
Oh, shit. Okay.

563
00:33:11,482 --> 00:33:14,396
This bag is better.

564
00:33:25,396 --> 00:33:27,499
Okay.

565
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:30,299
( Metal object clatters )

566
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,434
Shit!

567
00:33:32,435 --> 00:33:33,970
Ah, shit! Gary!

568
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:36,071
( Hoarse whisper ) - Gary! Gary!
- What?

569
00:33:36,072 --> 00:33:38,040
There's a fuckin'
man down here!

570
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:40,777
Shut the-- dude, I'm
fuckin' dead serious.

571
00:33:40,778 --> 00:33:42,245
Do you want me to replay this?

572
00:33:42,246 --> 00:33:44,847
No.
Here. Take this fuckin' backpack.

573
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:46,348
Here's a fuckin' crate.

574
00:33:46,349 --> 00:33:47,983
Let's just fuckin' go.

575
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,353
There's not a man down here.

576
00:33:49,354 --> 00:33:51,287
Man... Mmmm...
I just saw-- look.

577
00:33:51,288 --> 00:33:54,356
Right. I'm telling you,
he just crawled back there.

578
00:33:54,357 --> 00:33:55,959
Hey, dude,
there's nothing there.

579
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,961
You're tripping.
That's what trippers do.

580
00:33:57,962 --> 00:33:59,163
I don't blame you.
But, like--

581
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:01,029
I mean, it's a good
job at that,

582
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,966
but you didn't see an
old fucker or whatever.

583
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:06,536
Let's just hurry up
and get this shit and go.

584
00:34:06,537 --> 00:34:09,365
( Television static )

585
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:38,575

587
00:34:47,178 --> 00:34:50,480
Oh. Um... okay.

588
00:34:50,481 --> 00:34:52,114
Hi.

589
00:34:52,115 --> 00:34:54,084
This is... uh...
We're going on a road trip.

590
00:34:54,085 --> 00:34:56,251
Sam and I are going
on a road trip,

591
00:34:56,252 --> 00:35:02,125
and I'm gonna be recording
our mementos, our memories.

593
00:35:02,126 --> 00:35:05,195
Um... first memory
is Sam already pulling over

594
00:35:05,196 --> 00:35:07,030
to go to the bathroom.

595
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:09,199
But this is what we're
going to be looking at

596
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,501
<i>for a long time.</i>

597
00:35:11,502 --> 00:35:13,503
Nothingness.

598
00:35:13,504 --> 00:35:16,477
Cars.

Sam:
What we got there?

602
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:36,525
Stephanie:
I don't see it.

603
00:35:36,526 --> 00:35:39,628
( Indistinct remark )

604
00:35:39,629 --> 00:35:43,166
Looks like there's
bullet holes in the side.

605
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:46,068
Wonder if people go out there
and shoot their guns at it.

606
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:49,441
It's just, like, a fff...
Really messed-up car.

608
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,347
That's crazy.

609
00:35:56,347 --> 00:36:00,550
Uh... Don't forget to drive
really slow on curves.

611
00:36:00,551 --> 00:36:03,085
Okay.

612
00:36:03,086 --> 00:36:06,556
( All chiming )

613
00:36:06,557 --> 00:36:09,659
What are you doing? You don't
want to get a sunburn?

614
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,362
No, I don't want
to get a sunburn,

615
00:36:12,363 --> 00:36:14,364
and I forgot to buy sunscreen.

616
00:36:14,365 --> 00:36:16,266
Oh.

617
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:19,101
( Distant motorcycle

618
00:36:19,102 --> 00:36:21,675

619
00:36:24,675 --> 00:36:27,216
( Inaudible remarks )

620
00:36:32,216 --> 00:36:34,317
It must suck to be
woken up all the time.

621
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:38,154
Sam: Babe, are you
gonna wash your hands?

622
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:40,023
Ugh!

623
00:36:40,024 --> 00:36:41,959
Promise me before we eat
you're gonna wash your hands.

624
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,540
<i>I'll wash my hands after
 I eat with my hands.</i>

625
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,245
Sam: So this must be
the main drag.

626
00:37:02,245 --> 00:37:04,246
I can't imagine
there being much--

627
00:37:04,247 --> 00:37:07,388
singing barbecue.
Singing pig.

628
00:37:11,388 --> 00:37:14,388
- ( Shower running )
- So, Sam got this room.

629
00:37:14,391 --> 00:37:18,061
It's kind of dirty, and
there only two beds.

631
00:37:18,062 --> 00:37:20,630
I guess he didn't reserve

632
00:37:20,631 --> 00:37:22,265
with enough time
so that we could get

633
00:37:22,266 --> 00:37:25,400
a room with one bed,
which is annoying.

634
00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:27,103
But I guess it's okay,

635
00:37:27,104 --> 00:37:29,338
'cause then at least
he won't steal the sheets.

636
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:30,407
Um...

637
00:37:30,408 --> 00:37:34,110
But I'm gonna investigate
to see how dirty it is.

638
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:35,653
Uh...

639
00:37:42,653 --> 00:37:44,191
Okay.

640
00:37:48,191 --> 00:37:50,664
This is the germiest part.

641
00:37:54,664 --> 00:37:57,468
Aah. Ew.

642
00:37:58,468 --> 00:38:01,774
There's, like,
stains all around.

643
00:38:04,774 --> 00:38:07,242
You think I could
pull off cowboy boots?

644
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,243
- Mnh-mnh.
- No?

645
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:09,680
- No.
- I don't think so either.

646
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,315
<i>I wish I could.</i>

647
00:38:13,316 --> 00:38:15,789
It's sort of appealing
to me, but...

648
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:21,224
How 'bout a big ol'
wallet like that?

649
00:38:21,225 --> 00:38:22,658
I like that.
I would want that.

650
00:38:22,659 --> 00:38:23,793
Big billfold.

651
00:38:23,794 --> 00:38:25,328
Yeah, I think that'd be cool.

652
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:26,800
Cowboy hat? Could I
wear a cowboy hat?

653
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,134
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

654
00:38:31,135 --> 00:38:32,335
- Definitely.
- Think so?

655
00:38:32,336 --> 00:38:34,270
- Yeah.
- Should I go in and try one on?

656
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:35,609
Yeah.

657
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,411
Sam: Where are we?

658
00:38:41,412 --> 00:38:44,614
We're in wild west town.
Old town, wild west.

659
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:46,248
We're at the wild west
junction.

660
00:38:46,249 --> 00:38:48,418
( Sam chuckles ) All right?

661
00:38:48,419 --> 00:38:50,453
Come on in.

00:38:59,729 --> 00:39:01,831
- You got some money?
- I don't.

666
00:39:01,832 --> 00:39:03,799
How much does it cost
to tell your future?

667
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,169
I think it costs a dollar.

668
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,170
<i>But remember the movie big?</i>

669
00:39:07,171 --> 00:39:08,504
Are you afraid of your future?

670

<i> It's a whole lot better

I just said I didn't want you
to record something like this.

719
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,570
What are you asking about?

720
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:25,507
I'm saying that... Stop!
( Laughing ) ( Sam laughing )

721
00:41:25,508 --> 00:41:27,710
- Come on.
- I don't want to film this.

722
00:41:27,711 --> 00:41:30,478
Come on. Come on, make out
with me for a second.

723
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:32,846
I will make out with you
if you put the camera away.

724
00:41:32,847 --> 00:41:34,483
- But I don't want to.
- Why?

725
00:41:34,484 --> 00:41:36,890
'Cause it's so good.
You look so hot, babe.

726
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,891
Come on. Why are you
turning away?

727
00:41:41,892 --> 00:41:45,328
'Cause I don't--
( Indistinct remark )

728
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:46,801
Don't put that back on.

729
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:52,634
Seriously?

730
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,707
I said I would do it if you
would just turn the camera off.

731
00:41:57,707 --> 00:42:00,615
( Heavy sigh )

732
00:42:05,615 --> 00:42:10,022
Well... That's boring,
with your sweatshirt on.

734
00:42:13,022 --> 00:42:14,724
Will you take your pants off?

735
00:42:14,725 --> 00:42:15,892
( Laughing ) No.

736
00:42:15,893 --> 00:42:19,628
Come on! Gimme--
gimme something.

737
00:42:19,629 --> 00:42:21,037
Give me one victory.

738
00:42:27,037 --> 00:42:30,373
Ohh, you're so-- oh,
God, you're so sexy!

739
00:42:30,374 --> 00:42:31,773
( Laughing ) Stop!

740
00:42:31,774 --> 00:42:34,376
What are you doing? You
can't even enjoy this!

741
00:42:34,377 --> 00:42:36,579
You're holding a camera!
( Pounding on door )

742
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:40,916
Shhh...!

743
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:43,418
- You're being too loud!
- I'm not being too loud.

744
00:42:43,419 --> 00:42:45,920
Yes, you are!
You disturbed the neighbors!

745
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:48,056
<i>No, you disturbed
the neighbors.</i>

746
00:42:48,057 --> 00:42:50,659
( Pounding on door )
Come on, go answer it.

747
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,661
Well, I'm not going
to answer it.

748
00:42:52,662 --> 00:42:54,864
- You go answer it.
- I don't want to. I'm scared!

749
00:42:54,865 --> 00:42:56,783
Are you--?
Go answer it!

750
00:43:12,783 --> 00:43:13,885
It's a girl.

751
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:16,807
( Crickets chirping )

752
00:43:36,807 --> 00:43:38,477
Stephanie: Sam?

753
00:43:40,477 --> 00:43:41,443
Sam?

754
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:42,844
( Clears throat ) What?

755
00:43:42,845 --> 00:43:45,850
Will you come out here
and tell me what happened?

756
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:48,451
Huh?

757
00:43:48,452 --> 00:43:50,825
Will you come out here
and tell me what happened?

758
00:43:54,825 --> 00:43:55,930
What happened just now?

759
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:06,936
Um... Well, somebody
knocked on our door

760
00:44:06,937 --> 00:44:12,742
and I answered it,
and it was a girl--

761
00:44:12,743 --> 00:44:13,678
well, I don't know.

762
00:44:14,678 --> 00:44:18,047
<i>She was like, young, but not--
not, like, a girl girl,</i>

763
00:44:18,048 --> 00:44:20,486
like, a college-age girl.

764
00:44:22,486 --> 00:44:23,055
And...

765
00:44:25,055 --> 00:44:28,157
She asked if we could
give her a ride...

766
00:44:28,158 --> 00:44:30,793
- Tomorrow.
- Where?

767
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:34,163
I don't know. It
didn't get that far.

768
00:44:34,164 --> 00:44:36,431
It was, like, really creepy.

769
00:44:36,432 --> 00:44:37,633
That's so weird.

770
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:40,034
<i>I know. It is
really weird.</i>

771
00:44:40,035 --> 00:44:42,707
My only guess is that she must
be just going door to door

772
00:44:43,707 --> 00:44:45,808
and asking everybody,
but why wouldn't you,

773
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:48,978
like, wait for people to be
getting into their cars tomorrow

774
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:51,045
to ask for a ride?

775
00:44:51,046 --> 00:44:52,914
It's, like, really...

776
00:44:52,915 --> 00:44:56,085
- Maybe it's an emergency.
- It didn't seem like an emergency.

777
00:44:56,086 --> 00:44:57,719
And also, she's,
like, not--

778
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,189
she wasn't physically
intimidating,

779
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:02,090
but I got instantly...
Nervous.

780
00:45:02,091 --> 00:45:06,094
There's something
really scary about her,

781
00:45:06,095 --> 00:45:07,531
even though I wasn't, like,

782
00:45:07,532 --> 00:45:09,632
afraid she was gonna hurt me,

783
00:45:09,633 --> 00:45:12,439
but she was just, like, weird.

784
00:45:16,439 --> 00:45:19,113
( Crickets chirping )

785
00:45:23,113 --> 00:45:24,915
Stephanie:
She's gone.

786
00:45:25,915 --> 00:45:27,081
Sam: What?

787
00:45:27,082 --> 00:45:28,918
She's gone.

788
00:45:28,919 --> 00:45:30,222
She's not there anymore.

789
00:45:32,222 --> 00:45:34,657
That's good, right?

790
00:45:34,658 --> 00:45:37,934
Yeah. Do you think we should
still call the police, though?

791
00:45:43,934 --> 00:45:45,037
...no.

792
00:45:47,037 --> 00:45:49,737
( Clears throat )

793
00:45:49,738 --> 00:45:51,477
Why not?

794
00:45:54,477 --> 00:45:57,179
I don't know.

795
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:00,748
I wouldn't really
know what to say...

796
00:46:00,749 --> 00:46:02,184
- About it.
- Oh.

797
00:46:02,185 --> 00:46:05,589
And also, I just
don't feel like it.

798
00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:07,990
Haven't you noticed
there's, like,

799
00:46:07,991 --> 00:46:11,092
way more hitchhikers here
than you've ever seen?

800
00:46:11,093 --> 00:46:12,260
Yeah.

801
00:46:12,261 --> 00:46:14,762
And also I think this is, like,

802
00:46:14,763 --> 00:46:18,601
a part of the country
that has drug problems--

803
00:46:18,602 --> 00:46:20,602
- like, meth problems.
- Mm-hmm.

804
00:46:20,605 --> 00:46:24,105
So I feel like I would
rather just let it...

805
00:46:24,106 --> 00:46:25,608
- Go.
- Okay.

806
00:46:25,609 --> 00:46:27,276
And if she's still
there in the morning,

807
00:46:27,277 --> 00:46:29,612
then maybe we can
think about...

808
00:46:29,613 --> 00:46:35,016
Doing something about
it, but right now...

809
00:46:35,017 --> 00:46:37,524
I'm happy to let it drop.

810
00:46:41,524 --> 00:46:43,631
That's fine.

811
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:51,233
Do you want to sleep
over here with me?

812
00:46:51,234 --> 00:46:54,036
Um, no. That's okay.
I'm fine.

813
00:46:54,037 --> 00:46:57,038
All right.

814
00:46:57,039 --> 00:46:59,039
- Good night.
- Good night.

Stephanie:
I hope it doesn't rain.

820

Does it look like
it's gonna rain?

821
00:51:14,129 --> 00:51:17,431
Yeah, it looks like
it's really gonna rain.

No.

Yeah, you did.

( Laughing ) No, I didn't.

831
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:42,925
Well, you must have because
I had $100 in here...

832
00:51:42,926 --> 00:51:45,460
- When would I do that?
- And now I have zero dollars in here.

833
00:51:45,461 --> 00:51:49,431
Well, I didn't, so maybe you
didn't actually have that money.

834
00:51:49,432 --> 00:51:51,065
What'd you buy?

need to take your money.

00:52:04,379 --> 00:52:07,081
- Did you...?
- ( Laughing ) What do you think I did?

00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,951
Well, I don't know...
I've been with you...

a little further.

Out there having a
conversation on a cellphone,

857
00:54:12,975 --> 00:54:14,575
but it's so quiet
that I can hear her

858
00:54:14,576 --> 00:54:16,211

about 50 yards away.

- Maybe.

babe, I'm thinking...

866

<i>That we could  drive home on 40</i>

867
00:54:55,017 --> 00:54:57,251
and spend the night
in lake Havasu,

868
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:01,523
and sort of break the trip
up so it's not so brutal...

869
00:55:01,524 --> 00:55:04,025
Or...

870
00:55:04,026 --> 00:55:07,262
My new idea is we could go a
little bit out of the way

871
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:09,463
and spend the night in Vegas

872
00:55:09,464 --> 00:55:12,266
and still break the trip
up, for the most part,

873
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:17,276
but also have, like, one
more day of... Fun.

875
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:23,411
I just really badly
wanna play craps.

876
00:55:23,412 --> 00:55:24,746
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

877
00:55:24,747 --> 00:55:26,748
I had so much fun
playing craps last time,

878
00:55:26,749 --> 00:55:29,751
and I haven't done it since.

879
00:55:29,752 --> 00:55:32,156
It's, like,
the really fun game.

883
00:55:42,164 --> 00:55:45,169
All right. That is definitely
what I want to do.

00:55:46,169 --> 00:55:48,673

00:57:28,171 --> 00:57:31,539
<i> ( Music playing on radio )</i>

896
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,278
Did you erase it?

897
00:57:36,278 --> 00:57:38,952
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

898
00:57:42,952 --> 00:57:46,430
( Videocassettes clattering )

899
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,530
What's so special
about this tape, anyway?

900
00:57:56,531 --> 00:57:58,300
I don't know.
( Objects clatter )

901
00:57:58,301 --> 00:58:00,534
Maybe it's a tape of a senator

902
00:58:00,535 --> 00:58:02,570
fucking his daughter
or something,

903
00:58:02,571 --> 00:58:04,672
and we're gonna use it
for blackmail.

904
00:58:04,673 --> 00:58:06,441
I don't know,
as long as they pay us,

905
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:08,710
but I'll tell you this,
we're gonna make tapes--

906
00:58:08,711 --> 00:58:11,218
- copies of the tapes.
- More money.

907
00:58:16,218 --> 00:58:18,219
<i>Can you not put that
so close to my face?</i>

908
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,554
<i>It's so annoying.</i>

909
00:58:19,555 --> 00:58:21,789
Wait a minute-- you go
to this lake every year?

910
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,592
- Yep.
- By yourself?

911
00:58:23,593 --> 00:58:24,960
Wendy: Um... yeah.

912
00:58:24,961 --> 00:58:27,595
But this year, I have you
guys, so it's gonna be fun.

914
00:58:27,596 --> 00:58:29,332
Samantha: What do
you do, just, like,

915
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:31,333
walk around the woods
and play with yourself?

916
00:58:31,334 --> 00:58:32,867
( Overlapping reactions )

917
00:58:32,868 --> 00:58:35,737
If-- if that's what you do,
can I play with Samantha?

918
00:58:35,738 --> 00:58:36,870
Samantha:
Get it out--!

919
00:58:36,871 --> 00:58:38,441
Wendy: Guys, let's
scare this guy.

920
00:58:38,442 --> 00:58:40,608
- Where?
- This guy over here.

921
00:58:40,609 --> 00:58:41,942
Are you ready?

922
00:58:41,943 --> 00:58:43,511
Wait, wait, wait,
what is he doing?

923
00:58:43,512 --> 00:58:45,947
( Car accelerates, horn honks )

924
00:58:45,948 --> 00:58:47,581
Shit!

925
00:58:47,582 --> 00:58:48,717
Oh, shit!

926
00:58:48,718 --> 00:58:50,251
Ho ho ho!

927
00:58:50,252 --> 00:58:52,591
You almost fuckin'
killed that guy!

928
00:58:55,591 --> 00:58:57,392
Samantha: He was
kind of cute, though.

929
00:58:57,393 --> 00:58:58,726
- What?
- He was.

930
00:58:58,727 --> 00:59:00,762
You are-- you seriously
want to fuck anything

931
00:59:00,763 --> 00:59:03,364
that has two legs with a
third tripod in between.

932
00:59:03,365 --> 00:59:06,501
I would never fuck you
and I would never fuck you.

933
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:09,502
- Oh.
- Take it back. Take it back.

934
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:12,373
- I might fuck you one day.
- Yeah, what kind of guys are you into?

935
00:59:12,374 --> 00:59:14,876
I'd fuck me.
Would you, Spider?

936
00:59:14,877 --> 00:59:16,543
- Fuck you?
- Yeah.

937
00:59:16,544 --> 00:59:18,445
Eh, probably.

938
00:59:18,446 --> 00:59:21,616
Spider: I don't understand.
You go to this lake every year.

939
00:59:21,617 --> 00:59:24,552
It's just, like a tradition-type
thing, or what's the deal?

940
00:59:24,553 --> 00:59:27,054
No, it's just fun, and not
many people go up there,

941
00:59:27,055 --> 00:59:29,999
so we'll have the place
to ourselves.

942
00:59:37,999 --> 00:59:39,900
Spider: Wait,
I'll get the door.

943
00:59:39,901 --> 00:59:41,334
Samantha: It's good,
right?

944
00:59:41,335 --> 00:59:42,772
Joey: I want to see
you get it.

945
00:59:42,773 --> 00:59:44,438
Wendy: Can I
have a piece?

946
00:59:44,439 --> 00:59:46,642
Spider: I just got
a piece for you!

947
00:59:47,642 --> 00:59:49,978
Because when you told me
about this trip,

948
00:59:49,979 --> 00:59:50,680
you said it was just
gonna be us girls,

949
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,715
but now we're...
Joey: Wait a minute.

950
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,050
Wait a minute.

951
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:58,420
I need to document this, okay?

952
00:59:58,421 --> 01:00:02,023
You told me, Wendy--
Wendy, my sweet--

953
01:00:02,024 --> 01:00:05,860
that this was just
gonna be you and me,

954
01:00:05,861 --> 01:00:08,829
and now you've told her
that it's gonna be

955
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:10,664
all girls trip.

956
01:00:10,665 --> 01:00:12,500
( Indistinct remark )

957
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:15,001
Spider: I'm just glad I'm with
some people and not alone.

958
01:00:15,705 --> 01:00:17,807
Samantha: I don't want to hear
a word about you jerking off.

959
01:00:17,808 --> 01:00:20,074
Spider: I don't jerk off
that much, but...

960
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:21,576
- Not that much?
- Come on!

961
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:23,010
Spider: Is this it?

962
01:00:23,011 --> 01:00:25,447
Joey: I don't know.
Is this it?

963
01:00:25,448 --> 01:00:26,980
Oh, okay, yeah.
This is--

964
01:00:26,981 --> 01:00:30,719
( dramatically ) Ooh, dead end!
Let's take the left!

965
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,890
Really, Wendy?

966
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:36,122
...to go,
so fucking go, man.

967
01:00:36,123 --> 01:00:37,623
I can't catch that thing.

968
01:00:37,693 --> 01:00:39,126
Just get it.

969
01:00:39,127 --> 01:00:40,728
You have your
bowie knife, right?

970
01:00:40,729 --> 01:00:42,131
Oh! Get him, get him,
get him, get him!

971
01:00:42,132 --> 01:00:44,032
Spider:
Do you got him?

972
01:00:44,033 --> 01:00:46,735
- What is that?
- It's a barracuda.

973
01:00:46,736 --> 01:00:48,036
- A what?
- A barracuda.

974
01:00:48,037 --> 01:00:51,972
- That's a fish, you idiot!
- It's a barracuda... Fly.

975
01:00:51,973 --> 01:00:53,375
Oh, seriously?

976
01:00:53,376 --> 01:00:55,376
- I don't know.
- ( Spider chuckles )

977
01:00:55,379 --> 01:00:56,878
You wanna see me eat it?

978
01:00:56,879 --> 01:00:58,012
Spider: Yeah!

979
01:00:58,013 --> 01:01:00,148
Oh, fuck.

980
01:01:00,149 --> 01:01:03,717
You're not really
gonna eat it, are you?

981
01:01:03,718 --> 01:01:06,121
Oh, my God! Oh, my go--!
( Laughing )

982
01:01:06,122 --> 01:01:09,023
<i>Joey: ...I mean, I was
 here to fuckin' boink her.</i>

983
01:01:09,024 --> 01:01:10,157
Yeah?

984
01:01:10,158 --> 01:01:12,994
What are you--?
Wait. I have a question.

985
01:01:12,995 --> 01:01:15,096
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

986
01:01:15,097 --> 01:01:16,630
Huh?

987
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,766
See that, uh, blonde
goddess up there?

988
01:01:18,767 --> 01:01:20,534
- No, where?
- That's what I'm here for.

989
01:01:20,535 --> 01:01:22,771
I don't see much of
a blonde goddess anywhere.

990
01:01:22,772 --> 01:01:26,641
Or, uh... Blonde crack
whore, according to you.

992
01:01:26,642 --> 01:01:28,576
- Hey, give me the camera.
- She is a crack whore.

993
01:01:28,577 --> 01:01:29,942
You're not gettin'
the camera, bro.

994
01:01:29,943 --> 01:01:31,646
- Just gimme it for one second.
- Why?

995
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:33,782
- 'Cause I wanna do something.
- No. Go fuck yourself.

996
01:01:33,783 --> 01:01:35,083
Joey: Wedgie?

997

Wendy: Joey... Joey...
Joey: Did she wedgie you?

999
01:01:39,588 --> 01:01:40,954
Spider: No.

1000
01:01:40,955 --> 01:01:43,992
<i> That's more like it, dick-wise,
right above your head.</i>

1001
01:01:43,993 --> 01:01:45,527
Look. Stop-stop!

1002
01:01:45,528 --> 01:01:46,796
It's coming right
out of your head.

1003
01:01:46,797 --> 01:01:48,563
It's about the size
of your dick,

1004
01:01:48,564 --> 01:01:49,963

the middle of
the fucking woods.

Where the fuck are we going?

1008
01:01:54,134 --> 01:01:55,504
Can you get a shot of this?

1009
01:01:55,505 --> 01:01:58,139
Yeah, sure. Of what?

1010
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:01,543
What, of the wall?

1011
01:02:01,544 --> 01:02:03,445
Yeah.
Just humor me, okay?

1012
01:02:03,446 --> 01:02:04,813
It's tripping me out.

1013
01:02:04,814 --> 01:02:07,581
The last time I was here,
my friend fell over it.

Hi, wall. "Hi, Joey."

- You're so-- soon as you get back up.

carrying around grass?

1019

Okay! God! Jeez--!

Stop poking it!

it's not gonna hurt you.

- Oh, look!
- Yo, that's filled with nutrients.

1035
01:02:51,493 --> 01:02:53,661
Just suck on it.
Bite into it!

over there, crazy girl?

1037

Whoa, whoa, look at that!
Look, this!

- Oh, wow.

- Isn't that awesome?
- Yo, we could trip all day on that.

look on your face right now...

- Okay.
- You're a fucking dweeb.

I don't do drugs.

01:04:13,275 --> 01:04:15,009
How 'bout that?
How's that sound?

1068
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:17,211
Samantha: Spider, what's wrong?
Why do you look so scared?

1069
01:04:17,212 --> 01:04:19,213
I'm... scared of
getting the fear.

1070
01:04:19,214 --> 01:04:21,181
- Joey: What?
- Samantha: What?

1071
01:04:21,182 --> 01:04:22,952
The fear.
You never heard of that?

1072
01:04:22,953 --> 01:04:24,851
( Joey and Samantha chortling )

1073
01:04:24,852 --> 01:04:27,755
Don't laugh, don't laugh!
I'm serious. The fear.

1074
01:04:27,756 --> 01:04:29,156
You know, when you do
too many drugs

1075
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:31,327
and then you get, like,
all freaked out and crazy?

1076
01:04:31,328 --> 01:04:34,128
Spider, there's no fucking
such thing as the fear.

1077
01:04:34,129 --> 01:04:35,730
Joey: Just take
a hit, bro.

1078
01:04:35,731 --> 01:04:36,700
Samantha: Take a fucking
hit and chill out!

1079
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,967
- I'll take a hit if you don't film it.
- Promise.

1080
01:04:39,968 --> 01:04:42,104
- Joey: Okay. - Spider: Yeah?
- Wendy: Scout's honor.

1081
01:04:42,105 --> 01:04:45,109
( Indistinct
mischievous remark )

1082
01:04:47,109 --> 01:04:48,610
- Ahh.
- No, no, no.

1083
01:04:48,611 --> 01:04:50,312
You've got to, like,
breathe it in--

1084
01:04:50,313 --> 01:04:51,846
- through my nose?
- Breathe through your nose.

1085
01:04:51,847 --> 01:04:54,616
<i>Joey: That was
huge, girls!</i>

1086
01:04:54,617 --> 01:04:56,217
( Spider coughs, others laugh )

1087
01:04:56,218 --> 01:04:57,784
- Joey: Oh, man!
- Spider: Oh, my God!

1088
01:04:57,785 --> 01:04:59,954
Joey: Fucker's
gonna die!

1089
01:04:59,955 --> 01:05:01,322
( Spider coughing )

1090
01:05:01,323 --> 01:05:02,992
Spider: Fuck this.
Can't take that.

1091
01:05:02,993 --> 01:05:06,860
- Joey: Careful, bro!
- I'm sorry! ( Laughs and coughs )

1092
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:09,063
Oh, my God,
my throat's on fire.

1093
01:05:09,064 --> 01:05:11,632
Wendy, what the fuck
were you saying before

1094
01:05:11,633 --> 01:05:13,967
about us all gettin' killed?

1095
01:05:13,968 --> 01:05:16,237
<i>- Spider: Wait, what?
- Samantha: When did she say that?</i>

1096
01:05:16,238 --> 01:05:17,972
We were over by
the mushroom tree.

1097
01:05:17,973 --> 01:05:20,074
When we were standing
over by the tree,

1098
01:05:20,075 --> 01:05:22,976
she was like, "you're all
gonna fuckin' die!"

1099
01:05:22,977 --> 01:05:25,913
Spider: What do you mean, like, here?
Like, here-here?

1100
01:05:25,914 --> 01:05:27,748
Joey: Here?

1101
01:05:27,749 --> 01:05:29,983
- Did you guys not hear about this?
- ...No.

1102
01:05:29,984 --> 01:05:31,754
Why the fuck would
I come to this lake

1103
01:05:31,755 --> 01:05:34,355
if I heard about some
damn murders out here?

1104
01:05:34,356 --> 01:05:37,324
Yeah. It was
pretty bad.

1105
01:05:37,325 --> 01:05:38,925
- Wait.
- Are you being serious?

1106
01:05:38,926 --> 01:05:40,927
Joey: You're fuckin' with us!
Get outta here!

1107
01:05:40,928 --> 01:05:42,429
No, I'm being dead serious.

1108
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:44,065
Spider: Well,
what happened?

1109
01:05:44,066 --> 01:05:45,269
Um...

1110
01:05:48,269 --> 01:05:50,672
You know, the weird thing is

1111
01:05:50,673 --> 01:05:54,007
that I don't remember
what he looked like.

1112
01:05:54,008 --> 01:05:57,177
<i>Samantha: What do you mean,
you don't remember?</i>

1113
01:05:57,178 --> 01:05:58,414
<i>Spider: What who
looked like?</i>

1114
01:05:58,415 --> 01:06:01,282
What are you talking about?

1115
01:06:01,283 --> 01:06:02,685
( Laughter )

1116
01:06:03,685 --> 01:06:06,020
- What?
- Fuck you! Fuck you! I told you guys!

1117
01:06:06,021 --> 01:06:08,021
- What the fuck?!
- The fear! You see!

1118
01:06:08,022 --> 01:06:09,857
<i>Samantha: She gave me
the fuckin' fear!</i>

1119
01:06:09,858 --> 01:06:11,425
- You know what?
- Fuck this! Fuck this!

1120
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:13,828
- I'm going swimming.
- Seriously?

1121
01:06:13,829 --> 01:06:15,797
- Yep, seriously.
- Go for it!

1122
01:06:15,798 --> 01:06:18,032
Wendy: Will you strip
down for me, Joey?

1123
01:06:18,033 --> 01:06:21,402
- I don't care.
- Oh, yeah?

1124
01:06:21,403 --> 01:06:23,338
Samantha: Are you
sure you wanna see that?

1125
01:06:23,339 --> 01:06:24,938
Like I said earlier,
2-inch cock.

1126
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,174
( Spider laughing ) Mmm...

1127
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:28,742
Probably gonna be
two inches in a minute!

1128
01:06:28,743 --> 01:06:32,012
( Spider laughing )
( Indistinct remarks )

1129
01:06:32,013 --> 01:06:34,081
( Spider laughing )

1130
01:06:34,082 --> 01:06:35,949
Aah! Oh, fuck!

1131
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:39,950
- Oh, it's fuckin' cold, man!
- ( Spider laughing )

1132
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:42,824
Oh, my God! You--!
That was crazy!

1133
01:06:42,825 --> 01:06:44,826
That was fuckin' beautiful.

1134
01:06:44,827 --> 01:06:47,427
Wendy: I'll join you in a minute.
Or not. We'll see.

1135
01:06:47,428 --> 01:06:49,096
Ohh!

1136
01:06:49,097 --> 01:06:51,431
( Audibly struggling )

1137
01:06:51,432 --> 01:06:53,236
Spider: Are you se--?

1138
01:06:55,236 --> 01:06:56,838
What the hell?
Is he--?

1139
01:06:56,839 --> 01:06:58,806
- I'm fuckin' with you!
- Fuck you!

1140
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:01,342
Dude, I've got to take a shit. You
just scared the shit outta me.

1141
01:07:01,343 --> 01:07:03,379
Can I come with you?

1142
01:07:05,379 --> 01:07:08,449
<i>Samantha: Spider, did you
bring the fucking camera?</i>

1143
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:10,251
Spider: No.

1144
01:07:10,252 --> 01:07:11,918
Yeah.

1145
01:07:11,919 --> 01:07:13,254
So, what was the deal
with Wendy...

1146
01:07:13,255 --> 01:07:15,523
- And all that killer shit?
- I don't know.

1147
01:07:15,524 --> 01:07:17,392
That fucking story
was creeping me out.

1148
01:07:17,393 --> 01:07:19,893
- She is weird.
- I know, right? That's what I'm talking about.

1149
01:07:19,894 --> 01:07:22,130
The fear, right there.

1150
01:07:22,131 --> 01:07:25,099
What are you doing behind there?
It really stinks.

1151
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:27,869
Spider, you wanna
see something sickening?

1152
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:29,774
- Sure!
- It's fucking disgusting.

1153
01:07:32,774 --> 01:07:35,376
This is my new tryout,
Spider, just for you.

1154
01:07:35,377 --> 01:07:40,047
No one has seen this yet.
This shit is red hot.

1155
01:07:40,048 --> 01:07:42,016
Prepare for awesome.

1156
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:43,150
Wait, what?

1157
01:07:43,151 --> 01:07:45,018
( Whooshing sound )

1158
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:48,489
- Samantha: What the fuck?
- Spider: Oh, my God!

1159
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:50,123
( Wheezing )

1160
01:07:50,124 --> 01:07:53,059
Oh, my God, your eye!
Look at your fucking eye!

1161
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:55,029
What the fuck?

1162
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:59,300
Oh, fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1163
01:07:59,301 --> 01:08:01,501
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck!

1164
01:08:01,502 --> 01:08:04,539
( Spider groaning )

1165
01:08:38,539 --> 01:08:40,541
Wendy: Hey, Joey.

1166
01:08:40,542 --> 01:08:42,176
Oh, hey, what's up?

1167
01:08:42,177 --> 01:08:44,444
Oh, God, it's gettin'
fuckin' cold.

1168
01:08:44,445 --> 01:08:46,213
Where are the other guys at?

1169
01:08:46,214 --> 01:08:49,350
They left. Wanna fuck?

1170
01:08:49,351 --> 01:08:50,851
Uh... ( Chuckles )

1171
01:08:50,852 --> 01:08:54,188
- They left?
- Did you hear what I said?

1172
01:08:54,189 --> 01:08:56,091
Uh... so they just
left their stuff?

1173
01:08:56,092 --> 01:08:58,292
Joey, please do not
tell me you're a virgin.

1174
01:08:58,293 --> 01:08:59,961
What?

1175
01:08:59,962 --> 01:09:02,263
Come on, I think we should
get back into the lake,

1176
01:09:02,264 --> 01:09:04,030
fuck each other's brains out,

1177
01:09:04,031 --> 01:09:06,500
and we could even film it
for prosperity.

1178
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:08,935
Wow. Uh...
Turn that shit off.

1179
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:12,105
<i>Don't you wanna fuck me?</i>

1180
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:14,242
You were serious
earlier, weren't you?

1181
01:09:14,243 --> 01:09:15,576
About the murders?

1182
01:09:15,577 --> 01:09:17,411
I remember reading
about it now.

1183
01:09:17,412 --> 01:09:20,581
It was, like, four kids
were killed, and the guy--

1184
01:09:20,582 --> 01:09:23,384
they said the guy was,
like, insane.

1185
01:09:23,385 --> 01:09:25,386
He was beyond insane.

1186
01:09:25,387 --> 01:09:27,988
He was evil.

1187
01:09:27,989 --> 01:09:31,993
This lake ran red
with their blood,

1188
01:09:31,994 --> 01:09:34,595
and I came back... To move on.
I-I get it.

1189
01:09:34,596 --> 01:09:36,130
It's some kind of, like,

1190
01:09:36,131 --> 01:09:38,599
post-traumatic stress
therapy or something.

1191
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,234
No, it's not therapy.

1192
01:09:40,235 --> 01:09:43,270
I brought you back
because I needed bait.

1193
01:09:43,271 --> 01:09:44,905
Bait?

1194
01:09:44,906 --> 01:09:47,140
They never caught him, Joey.

1195
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:50,511
They never believed me, how--
how he was everywhere.

1196
01:09:50,512 --> 01:09:51,681
How he could be
at two places at once.

1197
01:09:52,681 --> 01:09:56,449
That wall back there-- my friend
smashed her head open on it.

1198
01:09:56,450 --> 01:10:00,253
Wendy, this is crazy, okay?
I think you need help.

1199
01:10:00,254 --> 01:10:02,257
Maybe we should just get the others
and get the fuck outta here.

1200
01:10:02,258 --> 01:10:05,559
- They're dead, Joey.
- He's back. No.

1201
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,528
And this time, I'm ready for you.
Get that shit outta here.

1202
01:10:08,529 --> 01:10:10,597
I think you need help.

1203
01:10:10,598 --> 01:10:12,703
( Gurgling )

1204
01:10:14,703 --> 01:10:17,074
( Wendy panting )

1205
01:10:19,074 --> 01:10:19,945
Unh!

1206
01:10:23,945 --> 01:10:26,546
( Wendy panting )

1207
01:10:26,547 --> 01:10:29,462
Give it to me. Shit.

1208
01:10:41,462 --> 01:10:43,475
Come on!

1209
01:10:53,475 --> 01:10:55,083
Come on, fucker!

1210
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:05,353
( Unearthly groan )

1211
01:11:05,354 --> 01:11:07,220
Why can't I film you?

1212
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:10,157
( Eerily garbled response )

1213
01:11:10,158 --> 01:11:11,596
Fuck!

1214
01:11:15,596 --> 01:11:16,730
Oh, shit.

1215
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:19,020
Shit, shit, shit.

1216
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:47,020
( Wendy breathing heavily ) Oh, fuck.
You came... Back... For nothing.

1217
01:11:57,538 --> 01:12:00,551
( Wendy panting )

1218
01:12:09,551 --> 01:12:12,289
( Heavy thud )

1219
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:17,158
If you're watching this...

1220
01:12:17,159 --> 01:12:20,435
( Distorted audio )
Don't come here!

1221
01:12:26,435 --> 01:12:27,801
Wendy: Joey?

1222
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:30,678
( Eerie gasping sounds )

1223
01:12:37,678 --> 01:12:38,714
Joey?

1224
01:13:13,714 --> 01:13:16,484
Wendy: What
are you waiting for?

1225
01:13:16,485 --> 01:13:18,618
( Heavy clank )

1226
01:13:18,619 --> 01:13:20,731
( Garbled laughter )

1227
01:13:30,731 --> 01:13:34,754
Wendy: I beat you,
one on one, asshole.

1228
01:13:53,754 --> 01:13:55,425
Oh, fuck!

1229
01:13:57,425 --> 01:13:59,260
( Gasping )

1230
01:13:59,261 --> 01:14:00,904
( Heavy blows land )

1231
01:14:43,904 --> 01:14:45,209
( Sigh )

1232
01:14:48,209 --> 01:14:50,543
Where the fuck
did those guys go?

1233
01:14:50,544 --> 01:14:52,481
<i>Where the fuck did they go?</i>

1234
01:14:54,481 --> 01:14:56,483
Here you go.
I've got a flashlight.

1235
01:14:56,484 --> 01:14:58,453
Probably fuckin'
each other downstairs.

1236
01:14:58,454 --> 01:15:00,587
Dude, we were just downstairs.

1237
01:15:00,588 --> 01:15:02,922
They're not downstairs.

1238
01:15:02,923 --> 01:15:05,458
Where do you think they're at?

1239
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:07,461
I don't know.
I'll go look for 'em.

1240
01:15:07,462 --> 01:15:09,263
You look through these
fuckin' tapes, okay?

1241
01:15:09,264 --> 01:15:11,231
No, no, no.
Just-- look--

1242
01:15:11,232 --> 01:15:13,867
just like that, you're gonna leave
me in here with this dead fucker?

1243
01:15:13,868 --> 01:15:16,002
Sorry if your vagina
hurts there, sister,

1244
01:15:16,003 --> 01:15:17,503
but someone's gotta do it.

1245
01:15:17,504 --> 01:15:20,573
Just get outta the way.
Just... fuck it.

1246
01:15:20,574 --> 01:15:21,954
( Sighs )

1247
01:15:33,954 --> 01:15:37,650
( Vcr whirrs )

1248
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:03,283
( Crickets chirping )

1249
01:16:03,284 --> 01:16:05,284
<i>- Hey!
-  Hi!</i>

1250
01:16:05,287 --> 01:16:07,320
How was--
how was work?

1251
01:16:07,321 --> 01:16:09,523
<i> It was fine.</i>

1252
01:16:09,524 --> 01:16:11,726
<i> One of the other girls,
uh, called in sick,</i>

1253
01:16:11,727 --> 01:16:14,728
<i> so I was the only one
answering phones all night.</i>

1254
01:16:14,729 --> 01:16:17,997
<i> Also, my-- my arm's
been really bothering me.</i>

1255
01:16:17,998 --> 01:16:20,000
<i> It's like I bruised it
or something,</i>

1256
01:16:20,001 --> 01:16:22,404
<i> but I don't remember how.</i>

1257
01:16:23,404 --> 01:16:26,006
<i> I think you can see.</i>

1258
01:16:26,007 --> 01:16:27,677
<i> There's a bump there.
Can you see?</i>

1259
01:16:28,677 --> 01:16:29,779
Mnh-mnh.

1260
01:16:31,779 --> 01:16:33,314
<i> Well...</i>

1261
01:16:33,315 --> 01:16:34,915
<i> I know I said
I didn't want this,</i>

1262
01:16:34,916 --> 01:16:37,717
<i> but when you're a doctor,
could you just support me,</i>

1263
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:39,987
<i> and I'll just...
Stay at home?</i>

1264
01:16:39,988 --> 01:16:41,988
I guess, yeah,
if you want that.

1265
01:16:41,989 --> 01:16:44,625
<i> ( Laughs ) That was easy.</i>

1266
01:16:44,626 --> 01:16:46,528
I mean, do you want me to
make it difficult for you?

1267
01:16:46,529 --> 01:16:48,528
Like, um...
I don't know, Emily.

1268
01:16:48,529 --> 01:16:50,831
I guess you'll have to
convince me here.

1269
01:16:50,832 --> 01:16:53,434
<i> Really?</i>

1270
01:16:53,435 --> 01:16:56,573
I mean... maybe
a little convincing, or...

1271
01:16:58,573 --> 01:17:00,610
<i> Well, how 'bout now?</i>

1272
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:06,713
Maybe a little more?

1273
01:17:06,714 --> 01:17:07,856
<i> How 'bout now?</i>

1274
01:17:15,856 --> 01:17:17,957
<i> ( Laughs )</i>

1275
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:20,360
<i> Well, now I can
show you my apartment.</i>

1276
01:17:20,361 --> 01:17:24,797
Yay. I mean... I'm gonna
see it soon enough.

1278
01:17:24,798 --> 01:17:28,735
<i> Well, fall break's
not soon enough.</i>

1279
01:17:28,736 --> 01:17:31,137
Um... I know.

1280
01:17:31,138 --> 01:17:32,878
<i> All right, so this...</i>

1281
01:17:36,878 --> 01:17:38,481
<i> Like, right here...</i>

1282
01:17:40,481 --> 01:17:43,751
<i> Uh, this is where
I heard the footsteps.</i>

1283
01:17:43,752 --> 01:17:45,485
Um, back there?

1284
01:17:45,486 --> 01:17:48,622
Yeah.
Right.

1285
01:17:48,623 --> 01:17:53,092
I mean, could it have been
coming from upstairs?

1286
01:17:53,093 --> 01:17:55,162
<i> No. I mean...</i>

1287
01:17:55,163 --> 01:17:57,730
<i> I know-- I mean, my
neighbor always wears heels,</i>

1288
01:17:57,731 --> 01:17:59,633
<i> so I know what
that sounds like.</i>

1289
01:17:59,634 --> 01:18:02,636
<i> It was weird. It was like,
while it was happening,</i>

1290
01:18:02,637 --> 01:18:05,838
<i> it didn't seem like it was
real, but I was awake.</i>

1291
01:18:05,839 --> 01:18:07,507
And you didn't check?

1292
01:18:07,508 --> 01:18:09,842
<i> Are you kidding me?
No way.</i>

1293
01:18:09,843 --> 01:18:11,645
<i> I can't believe
I was even, like,</i>

1294
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:14,414
<i> able to fall back asleep.</i>

1295
01:18:14,415 --> 01:18:15,851
<i>I mean, it sounds like
you were asleep.</i>

1296
01:18:17,851 --> 01:18:19,853
<i> Okay, well,
next time it happens,</i>

1297
01:18:19,854 --> 01:18:21,756
<i> I'll call you
and you can watch me,</i>

1298
01:18:21,757 --> 01:18:25,792
<i> and maybe I'll be brave
enough to open the door.</i>

1299
01:18:25,793 --> 01:18:27,927
'Kay.

1300
01:18:27,928 --> 01:18:29,132
<i> Okay.</i>

1301
01:18:31,132 --> 01:18:33,667
Emily?

1302
01:18:33,668 --> 01:18:36,136
Hello? Hey.
Hey. Hey.

1303
01:18:36,137 --> 01:18:37,871
What's?
What's going on?

1304
01:18:37,872 --> 01:18:39,675
<i> There's something
at my door. Listen.</i>

1305
01:18:40,675 --> 01:18:44,144
<i> ( Eerie, indistinct sounds )</i>

1306
01:18:44,145 --> 01:18:45,813
<i> Did you hear that?</i>

1307
01:18:45,814 --> 01:18:48,047
What was that?

1308
01:18:48,048 --> 01:18:49,922
<i> Shh.</i>

1309
01:18:54,922 --> 01:18:56,457
<i> Did you see that?</i>

1310
01:18:56,458 --> 01:18:57,857
Emily, what are you doing?

1311
01:18:57,858 --> 01:18:59,892
<i> I'm going to open
the door with you here.</i>

1312
01:18:59,893 --> 01:19:01,126
That's stupid. Why?

1313
01:19:01,127 --> 01:19:03,096
<i> No, no, this is
just like before.</i>

1314
01:19:03,097 --> 01:19:04,465
Hey.

1315
01:19:04,466 --> 01:19:05,847
<i> ( Eerie, indistinct voice )</i>

1316
01:19:19,847 --> 01:19:22,015
<i> See? I told you.
My apartment's haunted.</i>

1317
01:19:22,016 --> 01:19:24,717
It's not haunted. I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation.

1318
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:27,988
<i> No, no, this feels
really familiar.</i>

1319
01:19:27,989 --> 01:19:29,989
What do you mean?

1320
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:31,823
<i> Well, remember the first time</i>

1321
01:19:31,824 --> 01:19:34,028
<i> that you got-- you got
transferred off the base</i>

1322
01:19:34,029 --> 01:19:36,729
<i> when your father got transferred
to fort Leonard wood?</i>

1323
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,832
- I was, like, 12?
- Yeah.

1324
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:41,734
<i> Well, that was when things
got really bad for me,</i>

1325
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:43,837
<i> and I had-- you know,
I had my big accident</i>

1326
01:19:43,838 --> 01:19:46,506
<i> and I had to have surgery,
and it was the first time</i>

1327
01:19:46,507 --> 01:19:48,641
<i> we were apart
since I was really little.</i>

1328
01:19:48,642 --> 01:19:49,677
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, now is the first time...

1329
01:19:50,677 --> 01:19:54,146
<i> We've been apart since high
school, and I just-- I just--</i>

1330
01:19:54,147 --> 01:19:56,789
Emily!
( Emily screams )

1331
01:20:02,789 --> 01:20:04,062
<i> ( Sighs )</i>

1332
01:20:09,062 --> 01:20:10,562
<i> So, you think you saw...</i>

1333
01:20:10,698 --> 01:20:13,533
<i> Are you sure you saw,
like, a little kid?</i>

1334
01:20:13,534 --> 01:20:15,233
I mean, I-I think
I saw something,

1335
01:20:15,234 --> 01:20:16,969
but it could have
been anything, Emily.

1336
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:18,873
Like, you know,
maybe it was, like...

1337
01:20:18,874 --> 01:20:22,208
A breeze or something like that.
Breeze.

1338
01:20:22,209 --> 01:20:25,778
<i> Man, of all the times for you
not to be recording our chat!</i>

1339
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:27,649
I'll record it next time.
( Chuckles )

1340
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:30,551
<i> I need to find out
if a little kid died here.</i>

1341
01:20:30,552 --> 01:20:32,886
<i> I'm gonna ask my landlord.</i>

1342
01:20:32,887 --> 01:20:35,188
Um... I-I don't know
if you should do that.

1343
01:20:35,189 --> 01:20:38,992
I-I don't-- I can't imagine he'd be
thrilled to have that conversation.

1344
01:20:38,993 --> 01:20:40,826
<i> Yeah, well, I think
he has to tell me.</i>

1345
01:20:40,827 --> 01:20:41,696
<i> I think it's the law
or something.</i>

1346
01:20:42,696 --> 01:20:43,696
The law?

1347
01:20:44,899 --> 01:20:46,934
Why are you messing
with your arm like that?

1348
01:20:46,935 --> 01:20:48,601
What's wrong?

1349
01:20:48,602 --> 01:20:51,070
<i> It's not...
It's not getting better.</i>

1350
01:20:51,071 --> 01:20:52,805
<i> It's like this...</i>

1351
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:55,007
<i> Like, a lump under
my skin or something.</i>

1352
01:20:55,008 --> 01:20:57,210
You shouldn't do that.
It's not good for you.

1353
01:20:57,211 --> 01:21:00,180
Just stop touching it, and
when I come and see you,

1354
01:21:00,181 --> 01:21:03,283
- I'll check that, okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>

1355
01:21:03,284 --> 01:21:05,187
<i> You're right.</i>

1356
01:21:07,187 --> 01:21:09,590
Hey, Emily, what's going on?

1357
01:21:09,591 --> 01:21:10,923
<i> I'm hearing the noise again.</i>

1358
01:21:10,924 --> 01:21:12,593
<i> I'm gonna go check it out.</i>

1359
01:21:12,594 --> 01:21:15,295
Okay. Um...
Do you have a weapon?

1360
01:21:15,296 --> 01:21:16,762
<i> No, should I?</i>

1361
01:21:16,763 --> 01:21:19,131
Yeah, I think that
would be a good idea.

1362
01:21:19,132 --> 01:21:21,105
<i> Okay, okay, hold on.</i>

1363
01:21:25,105 --> 01:21:26,309
<i> Okay.</i>

1364
01:21:28,309 --> 01:21:29,976
Be careful.

1365
01:21:29,977 --> 01:21:30,721
<i> Yeah.</i>

1366
01:21:40,721 --> 01:21:45,725
W-w-wait. Look-- look
towards your living room.

1367
01:21:45,726 --> 01:21:48,228
<i> Well, I don't--
there's a lamp...</i>

1368
01:21:48,229 --> 01:21:50,631
<i> ( Indistinct remark )</i>

1369
01:21:50,632 --> 01:21:52,866
Okay, well, do you
have a flashlight?

1370
01:21:52,867 --> 01:21:56,640
<i> No. Oh, I have--
I'll use this.</i>

1371
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,239
<i> You here?</i>

1372
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:02,809
<i> James, are you there?</i>

1373
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:03,777
Yeah.

1374
01:22:03,778 --> 01:22:05,878
( Camera shutter clicks )

1375
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:08,252
I didn't see anything.
No.

1376
01:22:11,252 --> 01:22:12,721
<i>- See anything?
- Mnh-mnh.</i>

1377
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:17,924
Aah!
Emily! Emily!

1378
01:22:17,925 --> 01:22:19,364
Close your door.

1379
01:22:24,364 --> 01:22:25,998
Are you okay?

1380
01:22:25,999 --> 01:22:27,668
<i> I should talk to him.
I should have talked...</i>

1381
01:22:27,669 --> 01:22:29,769
Are you all right?

1382
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:32,005
<i> Hey, were you recording that?</i>

1383
01:22:32,006 --> 01:22:34,107
No. What do you mean? I just
got caught up in the moment.

1384
01:22:34,108 --> 01:22:35,375
<i> James!</i>

1385
01:22:35,376 --> 01:22:37,378
<i> Next time I call you
in the middle of the night,</i>

1386
01:22:37,379 --> 01:22:39,046
<i> please press record!</i>

1387
01:22:39,047 --> 01:22:42,388
Okay. All right.
I promise.

1388
01:22:48,388 --> 01:22:51,190
<i> Will you stay up
with me tonight?</i>

1389
01:22:51,191 --> 01:22:53,296
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

1390
01:22:55,296 --> 01:22:57,034
<i> Thank you.</i>

1391
01:23:01,034 --> 01:23:02,934
<i> So, I talked
to my landlord today.</i>

1392
01:23:02,935 --> 01:23:05,338
<i> He said no one's ever
died in my apartment, ever.</i>

1393
01:23:05,339 --> 01:23:08,108
That's not exactly something
he'd want to advertise, right?

1394
01:23:08,109 --> 01:23:10,408
<i> Yeah, but he said, like,
no kids ever lived here.</i>

1395
01:23:10,409 --> 01:23:12,145
<i> It's always been
student housing.</i>

1396
01:23:12,146 --> 01:23:14,814
Uh-huh.

1397
01:23:14,815 --> 01:23:16,817
What's that?
What are you doing?

1398
01:23:16,818 --> 01:23:19,953
<i> Oh, well, I felt that lump
move in my arm today.</i>

1399
01:23:19,954 --> 01:23:22,988
Emily, what the fuck
is that? Don't do that!

1400
01:23:22,989 --> 01:23:24,423
<i> Thought it might be
a spider bite.</i>

1401
01:23:24,424 --> 01:23:26,026
<i> You know,
how you hear about--?</i>

1402
01:23:26,027 --> 01:23:28,360
That's an urban legend.
That's not real.

1403
01:23:28,361 --> 01:23:30,830
<i> It's right under there.
Look, look, I'll show you.</i>

1404
01:23:30,831 --> 01:23:32,266
Stop! Stop that!
Don't do that, okay?

1405
01:23:32,267 --> 01:23:34,501
That's not good for you.
This is like your leg,

1406
01:23:34,502 --> 01:23:37,269
like seven years ago. You
still have a scar from that.

1407
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:40,506
Emily, what the fuck
are you doing?

1408
01:23:40,507 --> 01:23:41,876
<i> Well, I think if I just...</i>

1409
01:23:41,877 --> 01:23:43,877
No, no, no, no, no.
Put that away.

1410
01:23:43,878 --> 01:23:46,113
Seriously, Emily, look at me.

1411
01:23:46,114 --> 01:23:49,381
Emily! Emily,
look at me, okay?

1412
01:23:49,382 --> 01:23:51,185
You need to put that
away, all right?

1413
01:23:51,186 --> 01:23:54,755
Digging around in your arm is
not gonna do any more good.

1414
01:23:54,756 --> 01:23:56,922
You just need to put
some alcohol on that

1415
01:23:56,923 --> 01:23:58,859
or iodine or something
like that

1416
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:00,528
and-- and-- and put
a bandage on it

1417
01:24:00,529 --> 01:24:03,395
'cause otherwise it's just
gonna get infected, okay?

1418
01:24:03,396 --> 01:24:06,366
You know, I'll be there in a
week and I'll look at it,

1419
01:24:06,367 --> 01:24:08,034
but for right now,
just leave it alone.

1420
01:24:08,035 --> 01:24:12,139
You're acting really
crazy, all right?

1421
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:14,774
<i> Okay, okay.</i>

1422
01:24:14,775 --> 01:24:17,010
Okay. I mean...

1423
01:24:17,011 --> 01:24:20,012
Can you go to the bathroom
and clean that off?

1424
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:21,895
<i> Yeah, yeah.
I'll be right back.</i>

1425
01:24:33,895 --> 01:24:37,530
- Emily? Are you there?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1426
01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:39,965
I gotta-- I gotta do some
work, so what's going on?

1427
01:24:39,966 --> 01:24:41,903
<i> I know. This'll
only take a minute.</i>

1428
01:24:41,904 --> 01:24:44,203
- What's up?
- He's outside my room.

1429
01:24:44,204 --> 01:24:46,907
<i> I can hear the little
boy's footsteps.</i>

1430
01:24:46,908 --> 01:24:50,176
That's really scary, Emily,
what are you talking about?

1432
01:24:50,177 --> 01:24:54,346
Well, I just-- I need to talk
to him, and I need your help.

1433
01:24:54,347 --> 01:24:58,150
- Um... I mean, I'll help in any way that I can.
- Okay. Great, great.

1434
01:24:58,151 --> 01:25:00,454
<i> So, I'm gonna close my eyes
so he doesn't scare me.</i>

1435
01:25:00,455 --> 01:25:03,155
- What?
- I'm gonna close my eyes so I don't freak out...

1436
01:25:03,156 --> 01:25:05,057
<i> And run back in here, okay?</i>

1437
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:07,193
<i> So you're just gonna
tell me if he's there</i>

1438
01:25:07,194 --> 01:25:09,161
<i> and if he's paying attention to
me, and then I'll talk to him.</i>

1439
01:25:09,162 --> 01:25:10,996
<i> I'll find out
what he wants--</i>

1440
01:25:10,997 --> 01:25:13,365
<i> if he wants me to find his body, or...
whatever.</i>

1441
01:25:13,366 --> 01:25:15,835
<i> I just. Uh...
I don't want to look at him.</i>

1442
01:25:15,836 --> 01:25:17,238
<i> He's a ghost.
He freaks me out.</i>

1443
01:25:17,239 --> 01:25:22,241
What?! Um... Okay. All right.

1444
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:23,476
<i> Okay, can you do that?</i>

1445
01:25:23,477 --> 01:25:24,877
Yeah.
Okay, okay.

1446
01:25:24,878 --> 01:25:27,613
<i> So, as soon as-- as soon
as I open the bedroom door,</i>

1447
01:25:27,614 --> 01:25:31,551
<i> I'm gonna close my eyes, and then
you'll tell me what's there, okay?</i>

1448
01:25:31,552 --> 01:25:33,086
All right.

1449
01:25:33,087 --> 01:25:35,287
- Okay, are you ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

1450
01:25:35,288 --> 01:25:37,096
<i> All right,
I'm closing my eyes.</i>

1451
01:25:42,096 --> 01:25:44,497
Hey.
Hey.

1452
01:25:44,498 --> 01:25:46,632
<i> What's there?</i>

1453
01:25:46,633 --> 01:25:48,501
Uh... I-I don't
see anything.

1454
01:25:48,502 --> 01:25:51,136
It's just your hallway.

1455
01:25:51,137 --> 01:25:52,374
<i> 'Kay.</i>

1456
01:25:54,374 --> 01:26:00,382
- Anything in here?
- Um... no. No, it's...

1457
01:26:02,382 --> 01:26:03,986
Go in your living room.

1458
01:26:05,986 --> 01:26:08,222
<i> Okay, I'm not looking.</i>

1459
01:26:09,222 --> 01:26:11,124
Listen, I don't see
anything, okay?

1460
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:14,060
Yeah, you should go
back to your room.

1461
01:26:14,061 --> 01:26:15,227
<i> See him?</i>

1462
01:26:15,228 --> 01:26:16,631
No, I don't see anything.

1463
01:26:16,632 --> 01:26:19,904
Maybe... he's
done for the night.

1464
01:26:22,904 --> 01:26:24,904
<i> I'm almost disappointed.</i>

1465
01:26:24,905 --> 01:26:27,407
- What are you doing?
- What?

1466
01:26:27,408 --> 01:26:29,275
- Emily!
- What?

1467
01:26:29,276 --> 01:26:30,911
Close your eyes.

1468
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:32,181
<i> Oh, okay.</i>

1469
01:26:35,181 --> 01:26:37,283
<i> Is he here?</i>

1470
01:26:37,284 --> 01:26:38,618
Back to your left.

1471
01:26:38,619 --> 01:26:41,020
- Okay.
- Emily!

1472
01:26:41,021 --> 01:26:44,424
( Unearthly sound )
( Emily groans )

1473
01:26:44,425 --> 01:26:47,091
Emily. Emily.

1474
01:27:50,091 --> 01:27:52,325
<i>James: You're telling me
part of this thing is human?</i>

1475
01:27:52,326 --> 01:27:56,429
<i> ( Eerie, indistinct response )</i>

1476
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:59,099
<i> Well, how many more times are you
gonna have to do this to her?</i>

1477
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,398
<i> ( Eerie, indistinct response )</i>

1478
01:28:00,399 --> 01:28:02,367
<i> I don't know if she
can survive that.</i>

1479
01:28:02,368 --> 01:28:04,303
<i> ( Eerie, indistinct response )</i>

1480
01:28:04,304 --> 01:28:06,574
<i> I mean, you're telling me.
She thinks I'm in Michigan.</i>

1481
01:28:06,575 --> 01:28:08,207
<i> That's far away, okay?</i>

1482
01:28:08,208 --> 01:28:08,677
<i> ( Eerie, indistinct response )</i>

1483
01:28:09,677 --> 01:28:12,244
<i> And that tracking device
in her arm,</i>

1484
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:13,717
<i> does that have
an expiration date?</i>

1485
01:28:16,717 --> 01:28:19,455
<i> Good, well, take care of it.</i>

1486
01:28:22,455 --> 01:28:24,790
<i> We're gonna have to make this
look like an accident again.</i>

1487
01:28:24,791 --> 01:28:26,459
<i> ( Eerie, indistinct response )</i>

1488
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:27,793
<i> It's fine.</i>

1489
01:28:27,794 --> 01:28:30,130
<i> We have people
that can take care of it.</i>

1490
01:28:30,131 --> 01:28:32,137
<i> I'm just gonna have
to break some bones.</i>

1491
01:28:36,137 --> 01:28:38,040
<i> For fuck's sake!</i>

1492
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:43,042
Hey, how's it going?

1493
01:28:43,043 --> 01:28:44,743
<i> Made it back okay?</i>

1494
01:28:44,744 --> 01:28:48,314
Yeah, yeah.
The drive was fine.

1495
01:28:48,315 --> 01:28:50,315
Are you all right?

1496
01:28:50,316 --> 01:28:52,385
<i> Uh, yeah.</i>

1497
01:28:52,386 --> 01:28:53,687
<i> So, your professors
aren't mad at you?</i>

1498
01:28:54,687 --> 01:28:57,424
No. Um... I haven't
spoken to my advisor yet,

1499
01:28:57,425 --> 01:28:59,658
but, uh, I'll
explain it to him.

1500
01:28:59,659 --> 01:29:02,061
It'll be fine.

1501
01:29:02,062 --> 01:29:04,764
How are...
How are you?

1502
01:29:04,765 --> 01:29:07,167
<i> Okay. Um...</i>

1503
01:29:07,168 --> 01:29:10,502
<i> I went to see Dr. aberdeen
today, like I told you.</i>

1504
01:29:10,503 --> 01:29:12,306
Yeah, she came
very highly recommended

1505
01:29:12,307 --> 01:29:16,176
from my colleagues,
so... did things go well?

1506
01:29:16,177 --> 01:29:18,511
<i> She seems really professional.</i>

1507
01:29:18,512 --> 01:29:24,184
<i> She... she diagnosed me
as schizoaffective.</i>

1508
01:29:24,185 --> 01:29:26,586
<i> It's a mild form
of schizophrenia</i>

1509
01:29:26,587 --> 01:29:29,322
<i> and bipolar disorder.</i>

1510
01:29:29,323 --> 01:29:30,222
Okay.

1511
01:29:30,223 --> 01:29:32,559
<i> I mean,
it explains a lot--</i>

1512
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,492
<i> you know, why I thought
I'd seen ghosts,</i>

1513
01:29:34,493 --> 01:29:36,194
<i> why I don't remember
running out</i>

1514
01:29:36,195 --> 01:29:37,699
<i> into the middle
of the street that night.</i>

1515
01:29:38,699 --> 01:29:39,802
<i> I'm just crazy.</i>

1516
01:29:42,802 --> 01:29:44,640
Don't say that.

1517
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:50,342
<i> Well, anyway, she's got me
on some medications--</i>

1518
01:29:50,343 --> 01:29:54,213
<i> um, perphenazine,
and, uh, I don't--</i>

1519
01:29:54,214 --> 01:29:56,815
<i> I don't remember.</i>

1520
01:29:56,816 --> 01:29:59,351
Listen, you're gonna be okay.

1521
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:03,227
- You don't know.
- I do. You're gonna be fine.

1522
01:30:07,227 --> 01:30:10,462
<i> You deserve to be
with someone normal--</i>

1523
01:30:10,463 --> 01:30:13,832
<i> you know, someone who
doesn't have so many problems.</i>

1524
01:30:13,833 --> 01:30:17,636
<i> What if we want to have
kids someday?</i>

1525
01:30:17,637 --> 01:30:19,671
You know, um...

1526
01:30:19,672 --> 01:30:22,609
You're the only person I've
ever wanted to be with, Emily,

1527
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:25,744
so just... stop acting
like I have a choice

1528
01:30:25,745 --> 01:30:29,381
in the matter, all right?

1529
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:32,851
<i> I don't know what I did to
deserve to deserve someone...</i>

1530
01:30:32,852 --> 01:30:34,658
<i> You're so good to me.</i>

1531
01:30:37,658 --> 01:30:39,163
Get some rest.

1532
01:30:42,163 --> 01:30:44,667
<i> I love you.</i>

1533
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:48,868
<i> Talk to you later.</i>

1534
01:30:48,869 --> 01:30:50,279
All right.

1535
01:30:58,279 --> 01:30:59,912
How's it going?

1536
01:30:59,913 --> 01:31:03,416
<i> ( Distorted audio )
...Parts.</i>

1537
01:31:03,417 --> 01:31:05,952
<i> I have, like,
a sore spot or something.</i>

1538
01:31:05,953 --> 01:31:10,289
Did you-- did you hurt it
on the hike today, or...?

1539
01:31:10,290 --> 01:31:11,725
<i> Maybe.
Maybe I bumped it.</i>

1540
01:31:11,726 --> 01:31:15,561
<i> I don't know.
I keep fiddling with it.</i>

1541
01:31:15,562 --> 01:31:16,663
Well, don't do that.

1542
01:31:16,664 --> 01:31:20,366
I'll look at it
when I get there.

1543
01:31:20,367 --> 01:31:20,870
<i> Okay.</i>

1544
01:31:23,870 --> 01:31:26,773
What are you doing?

1545
01:31:26,774 --> 01:31:28,975
<i> Changing into my jammies.</i>

1546
01:31:28,976 --> 01:31:30,976
<i>- Oh, yeah?
-  Yeah.</i>

1547
01:31:30,979 --> 01:31:33,880
You can keep going.

1548
01:31:33,881 --> 01:31:35,515
<i> I miss you.</i>

1549
01:31:35,516 --> 01:31:38,217
<i> There was a lot of couples
on the hike today,</i>

1550
01:31:38,218 --> 01:31:40,752
<i> and I just felt
alone, you know?</i>

1551
01:31:40,753 --> 01:31:43,989
Alone? Yeah?

1552
01:31:43,990 --> 01:31:45,524
<i> How's that?</i>

1553
01:31:45,525 --> 01:31:46,698
Sit back a little bit.

1554
01:31:50,698 --> 01:31:53,600
There. Yeah.

1555
01:31:53,601 --> 01:31:55,601
<i>-  Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

1556
01:31:58,605 --> 01:31:59,739
<i> What were you saying?</i>

1557
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:01,012
Uh, nothing.

1558
01:32:06,012 --> 01:32:07,880

Hey, Zac.

1560
01:32:11,619 --> 01:32:12,922
I can't find any--

1561
01:32:15,922 --> 01:32:16,743
what the fuck...?

1562
01:32:35,743 --> 01:32:36,908
( Loud bang )

1563
01:32:36,909 --> 01:32:39,378

Gary: Fuck.

01:32:39,379 --> 01:32:41,747
Zac!

1565

Jesus.

Zac?

1570
