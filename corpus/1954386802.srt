Tell me what's your secret!

7
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,499
Must keep pace! You ask!

8
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,010
Go back to the first, it will change you!

9
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,290
But what is all this?

10
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,537
We wanted to say goodbye before leaving.

11
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,331
Congratulations.

12
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,578
I'm proud of you, son.

13
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,770

This award is great.
It will open its doors.

15
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,610
There was no money.

16
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,176
I know.

17
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,572
Go join your friends.

18
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,778

19
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,499

00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,819
You will be friendly with your classmates.

22
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,012
Fits properly!

23
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,418
- I have something for you.
- Really?

24
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,573
- What is it?
- A flight.

25
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,891
I also have one.

26
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,297
I love it. Thank you.

27
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,330
I feel this would be great.

28
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,100
Good. And the back too, right?

29
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,610
Really?

30
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,412
I know you want to go to Colombia,
but Los Angeles is worth it.

31
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,499
Could you live in Los Angeles, steps from the beach...

32
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,655
You've got it all figured...

33
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,977
Our future is now.

34

Driving School FAST LANE.

35
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,140

Fireball Pretty.

38
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,177
Pretty Box. You rented or loaned his father
?

39
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,380
This is a story in squares!

40
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,572
Must have a sense of humor,
to drive it.

41
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,860
This is what I thought.

42
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,130
CROMWELL TO  Willow Springs.

43
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,657

Markus of Moosebrook.

45
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,455
Hi Danny, Los Angeles.

46
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,219
Finally a companion among all these strangers!

47
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,410
- You point NASCAR?
- No World Challenge.

48
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,533
- Fix! Me too!
- You think it will be?

49
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,255
- How?
- The number 1!

50
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,013
- The Number One?
- Why?

51
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,370
You want an autograph?

52
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,658
If you already won five races in NASCAR

53
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,533
a Super Late Model, yes.

54
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,100
And if I won seven championship?

55
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,174
English
karting Championships and Super One Series.

56
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,138
I stopped karting at age 12.

57
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,651
- And the boys stopped you?
- Those who do not keep your distance.

58
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,289
Do not leave me behind.

59
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,854
Want to know which are the best?

60
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,851
Front looks.
Enzo and Paul Lauricello.

61
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,097
Laps They earn titles in the Italian championships.

62
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,132
They have a house in Rome
only for trophies.

63
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,332
These Italian pieces soon taste

64
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,419
exhaust fumes Lucas Mabeaux!

65
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,455
And you then?
What did you do as a race?

66
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,461
I won the championship drag
high school students.

67
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,457
Is this?

68
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,777
A little on the big...

69
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,538
But who's here!

70
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,379
A new hope!

71
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,416
No phone here. Never.

72
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,577
Twins Versace...

73
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,532
Let's admire her chicks,
boys.

74
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,580
My name is Richard Duncannon.

75
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,850
He is Liam Sterling.
The director of Fast Lane.

76
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,218
Does your instructors for the next 4 weeks.

77
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,091
We received 3,000 applications
worldwide each year.

78
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,819
It only takes 8

79
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,253
You're the best, OK.

80
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,055
But this will not help you
to have your diploma.

81
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,372
Do you think you know it all.

82
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,330
Let us show you that you are wrong.

83
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,096
And you will become
much better than you could imagine.

84
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,657
Do not be so sure.
I, I have a lot of imagination!

85
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,412
It was a cowboy in the room.

86
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,341
Who will accompany you on your walks?

87
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,056
The difference with other schools, it is our desire

88
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,257
Do you work as a team.

89
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,850
We will assign you a partner.

90
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:52,136
What differentiates success and failure,
is your ability to work.

91
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,016
You'll always be together, and passing exams
team.

92
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,457
If one of you is reset,
same rate to the other.

93
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,537
Do you understand?

94
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,213
You should
eager to show us your talent.

95
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,057
Then type exit and shame.
This is the beginning of a long series.

96
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,938
The first test serves as a comprehensive evaluation.

97
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,215
The cars are equipped with transpondes

98
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,059
to spend your time.

99
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,856
Table showing your best time
and show your progress.

100
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,780
First warm up lap, then 5 rounds.

101
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,578
Your enemy is time.
No other.

102
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,536
Sacred equipped tell me.

103
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,820
This is truly amazing.

104
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,420
The first time I've seen better.

105
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,176
- Why, in your opinion?
- The asphalt may be more adhesion.

106
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,980
- It's best to check.
- Do not worry.

107
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,700
I get the red lantern,
to be sure.

108
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,694
Hard, that first day...

109
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,058
Maybe it was his car.

110
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,655
This was not the car.
You have slowed us!

111
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,652
2/10e We could have won.

112
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,539
Drag,
is for fast cars.

113
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,578
But the race is to the swift guys.

114
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,178
You say what?
And if we were teachers?

115
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,173
You will find that it is faster?
We're just instructors.

116
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,014
And besides, he wears cowboy boots.

117
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,969
Bad news:
You still have much to learn.

118
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,852
Good news:

119
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,178
Our friends in the stables looking to recruit.

120
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,452
A month after the end of exams,
the two best of you

121
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,614
return compete in the Lucas Oil Cup here.

122
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,097
The
greatest drivers in the world have started their careers here.

123
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,934
... And you both follow in their footsteps.

124
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,898
Not with these times.

125
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,780
A snail would have more chances of winning.

126
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,451
So there's a lot of work.

127
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,620
You should go for it.

128
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,449
Here are the teams.
You will share your room too.

129
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,896
Enzo with Paul. Markus with Tak.

130
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,819
Danny Luke...

131
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,579
<i> Konichiwa </ i>!</i>

132
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,096

133
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,012
Included?

134
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,058
Sorry I can not be with Danny.

135
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,530
<i>Fede  lost, </ i> this guy.</i>

136
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,612
Smell you're used to.

137
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,534
- With the other cowboy.
- Yes, sir.

138
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:26,099
This gives me a rash!
This is stress.

139
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,014
He has done well today.

140
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,339
I hope fuck
tail on fire.

141
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,891
You better learn to turn,

142
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,014
I do not want a ball.

143
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,377
Come on, move it!

144
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,452
- Hi, Jess.
- How are you.

145
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,860
- Well!
- Sure.

146
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,378
They are very strong.

147
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,056
I mean, super good.

148
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,178
<i> This is the first day, do not worry / i></i>

149
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,737
Anyway... On your side, what's up?

150
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,534
Max did a fine.

151
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,533
3 For a time this year?

152
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,060
Become a lawyer quickly,
he will need you.

153
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,140
- I miss you.
- You too.

154
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,178
BULLETIN ADMISSION Columbia University.

155
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,689
The food finally!

156
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,658
God Bless the USA.

157
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,140
Amen, friend.

158
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,417
If I finish
files you me your number?

159
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,141
That means no.

160
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,491
- But no...
- It shows me that she leaves.

161
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,859
<i> Mangia, mangia </ i>!</i>

162
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,898
Until the heart attack.

163
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,580
This will make a driver less.

164
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,493
But I'll always be there alone.

165
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,737
And then?

166
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:10,220
If your teammate
continue so I could double tricycle!

167
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,971
Suspect...

168
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,295
Listening.
They want to destabilize you.

169
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,970
I had not noticed me...

170
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,850
None.

171
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,454
As you started driving?

172
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,337
I'm the youngest and my two older brothers

173
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,294
are rally drivers.
We have our father.

174
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,937
I wanted to make my hole,
So I started 14 years.

175
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,975
Pick-up my father
in small rural roads.

176
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,093
Two weeks after my 16th birthday

177
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,695
I won a championship,
and just went.

178
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,970
Awesome.

179
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,860
- A Canadian who is not hockey?
- I love this!

180
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,536
- But I'm better behind the wheel.
- It shows. You are fast.

181
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,294
Thank you. And I'll improve.

182
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,770
For me it's simple.

183
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,017
To be the best pilot,
should know your grill.

184
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,581
The brackets for the engine block.

185
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,777
Motors Doctor Single Cowboy...

186
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,972
In engines, I know!

187
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,290
Unlike you, I guess.

188
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,456
Do you have fat on your hands that
call it.

189
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,940
Pass their engines thesis

190
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,609
, but if you were quick, you do not

191
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,130
If my father saw my time,
he would have killed me.

192
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,181
This is also family time.

193
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,775
Since I was small.

194
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,409
I was still wiping
with your team.

195
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,139
He was Nascar driver.

196
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,055
- Cool.
- He who taught me everything was.

197
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,052
Cars... I'm addicted.

198
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,213
- This is when you want the pizza chef!
- OK. Out!

199
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,411
But catch me if you can.

200
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,134
What's mouth, peasant.

201
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,057
Come on!

202
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,417
Come on, calm down.

203
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,969
All is well.

204
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,653
And now my teammate! Super...

205
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,898
- Calm down...
- I know. Ok I get it.

206
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,259
But there is chance that Pizzaiolo calls as well.

207
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,020
- Come back here!
- Come back! Luke!

208
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,578
Hey, the food!

209
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,292
Addition!

210
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,371
So what?

211
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,537
You say that?

212
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,894
It returns the Texas cowboy.

213
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,496
Approach...

214
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,176
A little more...

215
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,378
They actually had to put the gum.

216
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,897
My God...

217
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,893
- This is what?
- Ask for help.

218
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,172
- Okay?
- My leg is fucked.

219
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,171
You went too far, Enzo.

220
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,809
Like you said...

221
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,372
This is a pilot less.

222
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,819
My God...

223
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,052
14 years and I never saw it!

224
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,897
If any of you still want
to run out of the loop...

225
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,177
you can...

226
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,579
can clean!

227
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,216
Item 2 of the agenda.

228
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,820
How could this happen?

229
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,696
I have nothing to do with it.

230
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,856
You do not understand anything!

231
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,653
This is the problem!

232
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,056
You team.
You should care for each other.

233
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,536
If your teammate loses,

234
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,535
is up to you to get back on track.
Included?

235
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,215
Yes, but Enzo?

236
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,218
Who tried everything he was.

237
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,498
He dropped the case by blocking.

238
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,174
Lucas  But he did not give up.

239
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,613
- He's stubborn as a mule.
- This mule was his teammate.

240
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,177
If you want to stay, you should find another
.

241
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,578
This is your opportunity to
only stay with us.

242
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,457
Mullins is in Europe for the summer.

243
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,010
De Luca is registered at another school.

244
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,655
Ramsey lives too far.
He ​​will not have the time to come.

245
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,092
Stinks.

246
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,659
Wait... Also,
like you know, maybe?

247
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,454
No. .. not him. No.

248
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,299
He does not live far away and is available.

249
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,736
He karting.
E has two preset here.

250
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,812
It has to be someone else.

251
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,500
No one else.

252
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,732
Otherwise, goodbye
scholarship this year and will try again next year.

253
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,136
Venues
Most stables will be taken.

254
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,729
Sometimes it's better to know
enemies.

255
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,136
I missed?

256
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,021
Not for me, anyway.

257
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,536
Spending Drag Racing, is bold.

258
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,181
Another thing that bit me?

259
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,010
You really has not changed.

260
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,940
Well, Mr. Jake Kendall!

261
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,412
Faster than lightning.

262
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,253
In any case, you were fast.

263
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,690
I did my best.

264
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,132
Good.

265
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,379
First things first.
Shows what you can do.

266
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,929
Shit, he beat me by 1/10.

267
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,936
Not bad.

268
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,296
This is my return on asphalt.

269
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,977
Your new teammate
a level closer to yours.

270
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,893
Come on, everyone. He is moving.
He ​​has to do.

271
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,130
What...

272
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:01,450
- Why did you move my stuff?
- They were on my bed.

273
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,373
I wanted the bed by the window.

274
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,101
Only I was there before you.

275
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,010
Are you super stressed.
Do not you feel in their place?

276
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,371
Why?
I earned my place here.

277
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,771
But you saw your time?

278
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,091
You are here because I had the accident.

279
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,179
Think what you want, but facts are facts
.

280
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,218
You screamed your engine.
It's your fault.

281
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,900
Do you want facts?

282
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:28,293
I should have her purse.
My presence here is proof.

283
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,020
- It's fate, Danny.
- Not a bit.

284
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,140
You were just in the corner.
We chose you from other guys.

285
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,140
Not because you were the best, but because
was available to you.

286
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,492
I'm here to win,
you to be my ball or not.

287
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,811
Is you, the dead weight.

288
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,176
You do not realize it.

289
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,656
Hi, Jess.

290
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,657
No, nothing...
I do not want to talk.

291
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,370
I'll call you.

292
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:10,695
Father, it made me very well.
More than I imagined.

293
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,613
E is beautiful here.

294
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,613
I knew I could do it.

295
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,815
I finished fifth in the first race.

296
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,579
Is not easy to take.

297
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,580
In my next call,
I hope you will be the first.

298
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,299
When I graduate,
everything will go as planned.

299
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,771
"Kendall" written in letters of fire
in a race car.

300
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,771
Promised!

301
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,695
"A"?
No, I mean a stable!

302
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:47,092
If you transfer correctly ninth time, you can

303
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,332
To 160 or 200-210 km / h.

304
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,571
Danny on the table.
Show us what you would do.

305
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,290
Well .. should...

306
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,650
Transform...

307
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,616
a bit as well.

308
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,694
- Lord!
- Jake!

309
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,695
- Do not you agree?
- Indeed.

310
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,895
You have to go to the point of
rope and walk just before power

311
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,171
history to win a top speed.

312
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,690
And that leaves more room
if you have to bend.

313
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,300
Okay

314
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:46,057
I'm willing to give you lessons.
You only have to ask.

315
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,179
You can take a turn,
is half the work.

316
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:53,494
Successfully control the vehicle to exit
,

317
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,650
is the other half.

318
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,295
This afternoon,
small exo position.

319
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,010
The slower of the two follow each other
,

320
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,212
until its speed.

321
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,020
At the moment,
exchange their roles.

322
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,455
- Well done, Tak
- Come exchange.

323
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,212
You're not fast, you.

324
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,618
It has been 5 rounds!
We should have exchanged our roles.

325
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,972
We can see behind

326
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,415
! Come and see.

327
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,771
<i> No seriously, if you put
longer than others... </ i></i>

328
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,700
my turn to be in front!

329
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,778
Do you want to be? Then fold
i.

330
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,580
You're too heavy!

331
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,975
Paul. Come on!

332
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,376
Here we go.

333
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,530
For the exchange, but me.

334
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,257
Boys!

335
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,814
Need help.

Follow me, I'll show you how!

337
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,852
We might shoot you.

338
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,252
You start following me.

339
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,737
<i>I have a song for you 
Follow the leader, leader... </ i></i>

340
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,621
<i> FOLLOW ME </ i></i>

341
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,135
Enzo! Tell them a little faster!

342
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,452
<i> Enzo, Paul, you do not have
nothing to do there. Sure.</i>

343
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,852
This is nothing!

344
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,975
Like it?

345
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,896
Bravo, beautiful waterfall! By cons
,

346
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,614

347
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,296
He masters, however.

348
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,018
Not bad.
Does it work for you.

349
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,012
- You think?
- What have you done now...

350
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,819
Very impressive.

351
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,051
It does not improve my time.

352
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,620
Still...

353
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,496
Do you have great control.

354
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,969
This is rotten, this bar.

355
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,338
Frankly, I'll tell you.

356
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,659
If you came here with my brother, this is
for money.

357
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,977
Goal 2 h.

358
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,654
The night gets interesting.

359
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,130
I'll be back.

360
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,812
See how it's done in Italy.

361
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,257
Wait, let me do it.

362
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,492
Danny, Danny... Stop.

363
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,579
This is a Ferrari.
Is not a Chevrolet.

364
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,739
- This is not for you.
- $ 100 though.

365
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,731
I would say well 200,
but you will not be able to follow.

366
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,934
Come on, say 200

367
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,340
Good luck, friend.

368
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,132
<i>I give you 30 s.
A Moment in large finite maximum and .</i>

369
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,775
I think it can happen.

370
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,096
You bet?

371
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,570
What do you bet?

372
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,300
Krueger will succeed.

373
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,130
To take, he took...

374
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,175
<i>is not close to having finite  So aboulez ..</i>

375
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,338
It's crazy that you came.

376
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,380
I was really worried.
More calls, text messages...

377
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,499
Sorry .
I think about these things.

378
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,056
And with Jake?

379
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,820
Find a pad
lovebirds!

380
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,450
Hi, Jess!
What are you doing here?

381
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,860
I make sure you
do not kill each other.

382
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,216
We are teammates.
Hey, Krueger?

383
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,176
- Where are you going?
- Where the wind will take me.

384
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,970
I never thanked him for the flowers you sent me.

385
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,537
They lit room.

386
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,978
What? Go...

387
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,290
Flores, Jess?

388
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,336
He was in the hospital.
Seems normal to me.

389
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,691
After all his dirty tricks against me
?

390
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,300
I wanted to be good.

391
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,095
- Sympa how?
- Frankly, Danny...

392
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,774
I'm not here for that.

393
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,050
To what then?

394
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,049
I was really worried about you.
And I said to myself

395
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,059
Manager  What is with you in LA
would not be a sacrifice...

396
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,173
"A sacrifice?"
Why would that be?

397
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,015
Because you took in Colombia.

398
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,172
This is super...

399
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,373
So you go to New York.

400
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,734
- You tell me when the count?
- On his return, not to disturb him.

401
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:37,570
- After everything that we had planned...
- You did not ask my opinion.

402
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,734
And what do you want?
You do not want a "we", anyway.

403
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,699
Are you abusing I never said that.

404
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,573
- I can not, not.
- Danny! Talk to me!

405
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,651
For?

406
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,133
I thought I was with the boys.

407
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,180
This is the case.

408
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,933
The shower in my room is broken.

409
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,654
Is not much use.

410
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,814
Well, anyway...
I'll be back later.

411
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,620
Why? I'm not naked.

412
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,252
You look tired.
The night was long?

413
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,535
You could say that.

414
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,532
Is cute, his girlfriend.

415
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,214
- It's been a long time?
- I'd rather not talk about it.

416
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,657
Problems?

417
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,614
More.

418
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,817
We parted.

419
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,257
Is difficult to understand what I'm trying to do here.

420
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:10,409
The passion for racing,
few people understand.

421
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,413
Asked you problem for you?

422
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,570
Race.

423
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:21,172
She puts guys uncomfortable,
a girl who is in charge.

424
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,253
And who is always surrounded by other guys.

425
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,578
How do you do then?

426
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,655
I hang out with guys who understand.

427
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,175
You're beautiful when you smile.

428
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,933
The Canadian  with tan lines!

429
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,258
I do not mean to interrupt.

430
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,253
- Do not worry, I left.
- You do not like Americans?

431
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,977
Yes, but not overbearing.

432
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,179
Ladies and gentlemen,

433
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,095
today exo port communication.

434
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,934
You will become a pilot and co-pilot.

435
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,457
Motorists should follow the instructions of your
copilot.

436
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,051
Maybe a little tighter.

437
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,460
Go to the apex, then you
collections.

438
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,092
4/10ths been gained in this field.
Congratulations!

439
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,414
- They go super fast!
- Do you have plans for tonight?

440
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,330
This is Markus!

441
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,935
Pedal to the floor!

442
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,339
Faster!
Why do you brake?

443
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,213
<i> You should listen to me.</i>

444
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,697
You could win  speed.

445
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,220
What did I say!

446
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,770
- At least I beat him.
- These two guys...

447
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,137
They are ridiculous.

448
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,054
This is like two dogs fighting over scraps
.

449
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,775
In the meantime, you should be suspicious.

450
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,293
True!
You did a great time!

451
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,613
Enjoy. Tomorrow will be a distant memory
.

452
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,219
Fell. Will.

453
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,611
This is teamwork?

454
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,220
Everyone has improved their performance,
except you.

455
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:15,133
I'll have to get to work or put butts...
!

456
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,892
Included?

457
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,690
It is useless to set the phone.

458
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,092
- I know.
- So Called It!

459
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,295
Why?

460
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,897
He thinks I changed our relationship
to my place in Colombia.

461
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,978
He knows how important it is for you?

462
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,256
I think not.

463
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,060
So explain.

464
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,693
Do you want to be a lawyer?
Learn to discuss.

465
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,372
As his father said,
"Who asks nothing gained."

466
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,133
Where did he come?

467
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,219
If you're too afraid to ask,
you will never get what you want.

468
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,819
But if he will not hear me?

469
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,652
This is because it was not the right person.

470
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,694
better understand quickly.

471
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,972
So you were hiding here?

472
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,656
I need to study a little quiet...

473
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,812
some driving techniques.

474
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,975
What motivation!
You impress me.

475
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,216
I believe this belongs to you.

476
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,013
- Thank you.
- None.

477
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,136
Thank you.

478
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,171
You want to come with us?
We go to the bar.

479
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:13,693
No, I will stay and work.

480
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,852
At the same time, I understand.
The food is not great.

481
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:25,697
Could go elsewhere.
Just you and me.

482
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,530
This is kind of you.
But this is not a good idea.

483
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,732
Yeah I understand.

484
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,740
You have to be revised.

485
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,770
You need to have.

486
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,778
<i> Hello, this is Danny.
Leave me a message.</i>

487
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,138
You should get first.
You are very broad.

488
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,171
Is just outside!
We need to take inside.

489
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,569
Nearest the line!

490
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,011
Always 3/10ths behind me!

491
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,739
Brakes! Brakes!

492
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,939
Stay on track!

493
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,781
- You, braking too early.
- Why I'm faster then?

494
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,136
- YOU plants!
- I better time than now!

495
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,411
- So much the better.
- You have something to say?

496
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,777
- Yes!
- Krueger, running!

497
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,333
A stunning control!

498
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,253
Have you seen your advice, too?

499
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,020
- They are very good.
- My ass!

500
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,490
You do it on purpose
to stand in front of me!

501
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,100
You will sabotage my brakes yet?

502
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,178
Stop, I never touched your car.

503
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,578
Not you,
but an employee of his father.

504
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,978
- The dream team!
- The U.S. team!

505
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,258
- This is perfect.
- Super, bravo!

506
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,289
It was good.

507
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,496
Not far...

508
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,220
Hey, Frankfurt... I told you ..

509
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,735
You are not yet serene about No. 9

510
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,776
If you want to catch us,
should take this turn As...

511
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,614
- A Man.
- As a man!

512
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,890
Is a back again?

513
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,892
You paused. Calm down.

514
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,255
Here we go.

515
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,213
You really balls.

516
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,940
Sorry,
I can not work with him.

517
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,329
No, you do not want.

518
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,412
"You do not want to."
This is not the same thing.

519
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,657
And if you do not want to change,

520
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:51,018
pack your bags, you
wasting my time.

521
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,135
Gently, gently!

522
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,021
You're going too fast!

523
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,179
Never been faster.

524
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,854
Slow! Slowly!

525
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,496
Mike sends a team of 9!

526
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:24,215
It's a good look...

527
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,412
This is what you expect if you exceed limits
.

528
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,651
Each of you is a counterweight at the other.

529
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,661
If you do not hear your
teammate

530
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,017
Consequences can be fatal.

531
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,934
Markus and Tak...
You're lucky to see them again.

532
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,497
But not this season.

533
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,933
I thought you would have a
was the first accident.

534
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,332
You are not a team, you pull.

535
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,460
I did not want him...

536
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,691
Why do you think we chose?

537
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:04,097
We have not chosen your team, your team
as we are beginners.

538
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:07,298
You'll take what,
and will roll.

539
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:11,249
How do you think this happened with Richard
at the beginning?

540
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:19,731
If you want to get there,
stop throwing legs.

541
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,859
And focus on your qualities.

542
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,417
You have not tried yet.

543
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,099
Okay?

544
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,459
- You do not know how to hit.
- I was not talking about it.

545
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,818
But  next time,
lose your stuff before it bursts.

546
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,458
This is something you have to let go.

547
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,291
This is normal after what happened.

548
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,780
But the right of Sterling, you know.

549
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:12,058
If we can not work together as
drop the case.

550
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,095
Lo better manage curves,
I know.

551
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,013
I'll admit.

552
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,813
But you do not have enough speed.

553
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,501
This is why I always get
to catch you!

554
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,698
Loose yourself. What is the problem?

555
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,532
I can not accelerate to the maximum.

556
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,860
Where your braking too early?

557
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:45,620
Help me with my lines,
I take care of your speed.

558
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:53,017
There are two places to take drivers.
Can happen.

559
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,581
Do you feel well?

560
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,418
Go walk Kendall!

561
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,417
A hug or anything.

562
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,656
Come on, get up.

563
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,210
Here we go!

564
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:37,659
This change again,
you take it too early.

565
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:40,892
Uses the line. What is the rule?

566
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,540
The apex
is the speed at which you take the turn.

567
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,020
This is especially true for the 4

568
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,052
This is a back double apex.

569
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,938
Is not easy to negotiate.

570
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:55,860
Speaking to negotiate.
It's something between you and Michelle?

571
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,650
None.

572
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,775
And what I saw in the showers,
the other day?

573
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,380
That was a mistake.

574
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,259
You can continue to work?

575
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,614
Howdy,
not see what's behind...

576
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:38,852
Great...

577
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,130
Large...

578
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,132
Now!

579
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,933
3 tours with 1/10th ever taken.
He ​​understood!

580
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:57,536
As you can push the max?

581
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,896
Should go smoothly.
I will show you.

582
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,096
Put ​​yourself on one leg.

583
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:04,214
- If I do this, what's happening?
- Hey, calm down!

584
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,134
- So?
- I lose my balance.

585
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,619
But the same applied force
more slowly allows you to get used to it.

586
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,295
Is the same car,
need to be calm.

587
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:17,294
Thus, if it starts to fall,
you can resume in hand.

588
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:18,651
You are a genius.

589
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:28,460
Break your wheel slowly
at apex.

590
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,412
You just earn 10 km time.

591
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,531
Super Friend!

592
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,775
You do what accounts with Jess?

593
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:47,259
- I do not know yet.
- Think too.

594
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:51,739
Your bitch is coming
far because it takes you.

595
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,779
Do you know what it is worth
if you had made in hospital

596
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,296
Only with visitors from their parents.

597
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,661
You can believe me.

598
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:05,890
I leave end of August.

599
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:08,177
My mother is with me one week.

600
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,774
To help me resolve.

601
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:13,257
Hi, Jess. How are you?

602
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:14,770
Good.

603
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,449
You do something after? Tony organizes

604
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,732
- a huge bang, you coming?
- No thanks.

605
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,771
Okay

606
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,895
You are unique, apparently.

607
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:29,090
- Where'd you hear that?
- News travels fast.

608
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,450
Really?

609
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,100
What are you doing here?

610
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,700
- I want to talk to you.
- Are you ready, then I have to listen to you?

611
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,653
Thou hast crossed.

612
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,620
You did something Krueger.

613
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:43,938
I'm sorry.
But please, just 5 min.

614
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,574
He is not interested.

615
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,055
What you get?

616
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:50,731
Fortunately you do not do football,
you missed the ball there.

617
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,897
His team last how long?

618
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,655
Brock!

619
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,901
Really?
Are you sure of yourself there?

620
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:05,661
- Difficult to send the ball with a broken arm.
- Say it to my friends.

621
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,052
Enough!

622
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:14,217
I'll go with you. OK?

623
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:15,740
You can keep it.

624
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,575
You wanted to talk, right?

625
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,810
Listen...

626
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,052
Since I'm in Willow Springs,
I'm choosing.

627
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,812
All they have much more experience.

628
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,300
I lost my teammate,

629
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,691
then was Jake,
farewell or purse.

630
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,179
Since his arrival,
I do not trust everything.

631
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,456
Except today...

632
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,575
where I can breathe again.

633
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,137
Do you think your speech
organize things?

634
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,698
I do not know.

635
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,257
This does not work well!

636
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,651
At least of your worries,
I answered it.

637
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,421
I put no obstacle in the way.

638
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:04,292
I know!

639
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,969
And when I
something dear to my heart,

640
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,177
you reproach me not to think "we"?

641
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,370
This is not what I meant!

642
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,412
Do not you see that
things from his point of view.

643
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,421
Do you know why I want to go to Colombia
?

644
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,458
This was my father's university.

645
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:23,656
I remember when we visited the campus.

646
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,053
One of my fondest memories of him,

647
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:30,736
is his eyes when I told him
I would go there too.

648
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,656
How would I know?

649
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,861
- You did not tell me anything.
- You did not ask!

650
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,537
Sorry.

651
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,973
I will study there. That's it.

652
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:47,937
It's like you and Willow Springs.

653
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,854
What do we do then?

654
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,137
How?

655
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,419
I want to continue with you.
Always.

656
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,217
I want to make sure that it works.
You?

657
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,900
Of course you do!

658
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,215
<i> Closer, come on.</i>

659
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:13,420
<i> Again.</i>

660
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,889
<i>-  Ok, here
-  Yes? as well.</i>

661
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,060
- In.
- Yes!

662
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,980
I'll put 4/10ths!

663
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:54,337
I love you too,
but I'm a winner.

664
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:12,294
Let's put gum, Enzo.

665
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:21,419
Is. The time of the final test.

666
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,492
10 rounds, all in the loop.

667
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:27,131
For two winners:
An international management team.

668
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,135
The  starting grid was determined by averaging
your individual time.

669
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:35,376
Will be very tight because there is a difference s

670
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,970
between the top 5 times.

671
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,892
Do you miss the race?

672
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,734
Most do not.

673
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,300
Every other day, actually.

674
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:03,091
- Hi, Grandpa!
- Hi, Jimmy.

675
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,900
Our son team mates?
Can you believe, you?

676
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,771
We talked on the way, exactly.

677
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:14,337
- I'm going to park, and here we go.
- Super!

678
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,699
- Super...
- Be Nice.

679
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:17,930
Who? Me?

680
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:24,695
No rush to overtake.
Wait fault.

681
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:29,374
When you're in the lead,
thinks only its direction.

682
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,459
If you'll put on your thinking caps promoter

683
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,330
is death.

684
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,816
Okay?

685
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,171
I do not expect to see him in a circuit.

686
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,533
Imprisoning them.

687
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,657
Do not make me ashamed.

688
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,173
Good luck, guys.

689
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,813
- How are you?
- Great.

690
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:14,578
I do not want to move,
but if I win my place in the team,

691
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:17,215
I came to see you in class
Colombia.

692
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:25,730
Are you ready?

693
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:27,735
Totally.

694
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,496
Remember, you take the head
and I am you.

695
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,094
As usual.

696
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,655
Krueger!

697
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,780
I wondered if I
would see him again.

698
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,897
Mr. Apshaw!
What are you doing here?

699
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,780
I come here every year. See notes.

700
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:45,897
Good luck Krueger.

701
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,780
- It was...
- My ex-sponsor.

702
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:53,052
And you hit him your money.

703
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:56,692
Not bad.

704
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,450
<i>Pilots   up / i></i>

705
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,010
They may have actually your chances.

706
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:53,500
<i> Take inside / i></i>

707
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:56,693
off!
He ​​can not block us both.

708
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:07,732
Shit!

709
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,495
I do not let it pass.

710
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,140
<i>Kendall just double  bambina / i></i>

711
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:41,292
- It's my ass.
- Where Krueger?

712
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:44,294
- Behind her.
- Let him go, let's have fun.

713
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:02,577
This is my son!

714
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,897
Goodbye Mario.
Next goal Luigi!

715
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,856
It was a little too easy.
Beware!

716
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:18,620
Makes me feel aggressive!

717
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,090
Destabilizing He wants you!
Focus!

718
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:46,177
He wants to test my brakes, or what?
They took my sandwich!

719
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:47,894
<i>- Get me out!
 - Stay calm / i></i>

720
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,614
Do not try anything before I get ..

721
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:11,172
Well done!

722
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,494
<i> Be quiet, I can / i></i>

723
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,657
Krueger will get me!

724
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,055
We will remove Kendall!

725
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,571
I have to leave.
I put the gas.

726
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:32,255
No, wait! I'm almost there!

727
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:38,332
Now!

728
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:48,850
What was that?

729
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,339
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

730
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,220
I told you to wait!

731
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,452
- I was just behind.
- Danny.

732
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:19,780
Do you want to double the No. 4!

733
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:21,812
Danny...

734
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:23,780
I cover it!

735
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,101
If you had listened to me!

736
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:27,294
Okay, stop.

737
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,139
This race was everything to me!

738
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:31,861
With his money, he can reinstate it.

739
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,341
Tell your child to calm down!

740
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:37,580
This is good. Danny falls go.

741
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,812
Here we go.

742
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,610
Is in the eye of the hurricane.
He ​​should leave.

743
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,497
- How is he?
- It's okay.

744
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,492
We'll radios, to be sure.

745
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,857
- It's okay.
- No you will not.

746
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:12,372
A small obstacle in your way.
Let overtake.

747
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:16,139
We will find a solution.

748
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:49,500
You defended well.
We can see again the asphalt.

749
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:33,814
- How are you today?
- Like yesterday and the day before.

750
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:36,973
Remind me to complain again?

751
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:46,018
You are unhurt from a sacred accident.

752
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:48,490
Life is short,
you should enjoy.

753
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:50,453
My life stops in Bradford.

754
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:58,980
I'll tell you one thing.

755
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:04,536
When finished Chouin like a baby, help me a bit.

756
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:11,934
I do not understand! We were a team.
What happened?

757
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,013
You mentioned?

758
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:19,810
For? I'm here now.

759
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:23,058
Jake is the only person who has
answers your questions.

760
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:27,134
His attitude starts to get on my system.

761
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,658
Do you spend a bad day?

762
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:39,014
This day is far from bad.
For you and for me.

763
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:41,735
- This is it.
- A bad day

764
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:46,895
this is the day your
money led to a wall at 250 km hour!

765
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:50,412
On your dream career break
1 s with his clutch

766
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:52,339
is a bad day!

767
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,457
On your taskbar wife with his son

768
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:56,498
leaving him a remnant of vodka.

769
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,010
's Bad days!

770
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,693
This sucks.

771
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:05,659
So listen...

772
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:10,539
you will have a whole layer...

773
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:13,060
And put it to work.

774
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:16,460
's Okay.

775
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:35,971
Looks like you have a visitor.

776
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:41,620
Bring him Fernando.

777
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:48,059
Ok, Krueger?

778
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:52,890
I passed the corner... I wanted to see how you were.

779
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:55,816
All is well.

780
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:58,620
I was out of my cast
in a week.

781
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,940
So, you work here?

782
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:14,019
Listen, Jake...
I wanted to apologize.

783
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,056
For what happened there.

784
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:23,413
I abused.

785
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:24,297
Sorry.

786
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,054
You do not have to apologize.

787
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:30,135
But what happened?

788
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:35,216
I do not know. I screwed up.

789
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,492
I should have listened.

790
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:42,697
This is the past.

791
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,059
Rank.

792
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:58,860
Danny! Wait a minute.

793
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:07,055
I find it hard to give me
my accident last year.

794
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:11,339
I thought resume the race,
would be better.

795
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:17,573
However, when I try to run background
, I block.

796
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:21,938
This panic mug me and not let go.

797
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:23,541
Do you have a punch of stress.

798
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:26,778
He will return,
you are not the first.

799
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:31,734
A driver who is afraid of speed,
What is a fish afraid of water.

800
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,340
This is death.

801
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,095
As a teammate, I would have told
.

802
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:39,010
I'm sorry.

803
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:53,616
Krueger had yet to stir you?

804
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:57,218
- No, he came to apologize.
- Great. He abused.

805
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:58,336
Not a bit.

806
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:01,374
Travel though.
He ​​will put everything back.

807
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:04,090
It was my fault.
I panicked.

808
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:12,172
How?
I thought it was over.

809
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,129
Yeah, me too.

810
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:20,496
You made a small step back.
Turns.

811
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:22,572
You have to go back...

812
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:24,578
I tried.
You saw the result.

813
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,454
Try again and again.

814
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,936
This will never be good enough for you!

815
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:32,531
I have to be smarter,
stronger, faster... Always!

816
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:34,333
You make me  what, where?

817
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:39,057
At 6 years, you refused
your yellow kart!

818
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:42,372
- And then you tell me to leave?
- No, I abandon it.

819
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:46,931
But I do it my way.

820
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:55,780
Explains.

821
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:07,812
Are you hungry? This lunch!

822
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:12,140
With my extra time...

823
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,736
I will soon buy a ticket.

824
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:16,178
For?

825
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:19,016
You attend a week.
In your peeps.

826
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:21,451
I do not know New York.

827
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,571
I am a great guide.

828
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:30,410
This is the Mustang Jake...

829
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:43,136
The place where anything is possible...

830
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:44,900
What are you doing here?

831
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:47,701
I wanted you to be the first to know
...

832
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:52,776
My father and I,
let's build our own team.

833
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:54,340
Lets run Lucas Oil Cup.

834
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:57,289
This is amazing.

835
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:00,652
So you take the wheel?

836
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,491
Not me, no. You.

837
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:09,217
How?
I want you to be our driver.

838
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:14,855
Are you serious?

839
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:18,737
You are a better rider than me.
Accepted.

840
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:22,010
Total!

841
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:26,177
So, I'm your boss.

842
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:28,977
Danny...

843
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:35,098
Jake. Okay?

844
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,732
I have only been engaged in a stable.

845
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:42,414
And besides,
is looking for a Chief Engineer.

846
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:45,018
I have nothing against the Mustang,

847
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:47,536
But we have a lighter car.

848
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,293
Less than 1.5 t.

849
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:51,497
A queer, you mean?

850
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:56,616
<i>My customers buy  taken in </ i> U.S.. My budget will focus
U.S. too.</i>

851
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:59,460
This discussion is pointless.

852
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:00,576
Why?

853
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:03,733
No time for a crate.

854
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:04,971
Let  buy one.

855
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:09,819
It does not even have what it takes
register.

856
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:12,058
You must have participated in three races.

857
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:24,094
If you join an existing team?

858
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:32,371
'll Be super complicated.

859
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:38,500
This is interesting, Krueger,
but I'll pass.

860
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,212
It provides the driver and the team!

861
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:44,179
But you use my name, my reputation and my
cars.

862
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:47,697
Given his past
I do not have peace of mind.

863
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:50,654
Respect,
there are two types of drivers.

864
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:54,097
Those who have had an accident
and those who have one.

865
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:58,010
Is not proposed to share the responsibility and expense
.

866
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:01,735
You have a team
100% brand new with an unknown driver.

867
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:04,217
But you have a team in place
unmanned!

868
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:07,658
Your officer is the key
for the year.

869
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:10,571
Sorry, but I made my choice.

870
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,249
Can we win the Lucas Oil
Cup this year.

871
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:15,691
And maybe
Championship World Challenge...

872
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:18,654
Your insurance like me, really.

873
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:20,140
But it is very risky.

874
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:23,658
Danny broke the record back in its class.

875
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:25,340
10 years he held.

876
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:28,772
Can not find a better driver.

877
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:32,530
Seems, yes.

878
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:36,533
But soon after, you collided...

879
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:05,539
Are you ready?
Want to see your car?

880
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:11,412
Pep Boys is one of my biggest sponsors
.

881
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,890
They fully support us.
Markus will help you.

882
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:15,813
At your service.

883
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,092
Franco! Can you help me?

884
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:41,535
She is very beautiful.

885
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,209
- I'm jealous.
- What?

886
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:47,619
- You've seen how the companions!
- She reminds me of you.

887
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:49,334
This is a rear wheel drive.

888
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:52,897
- Everything is ready?
- There are some minor adjustments.

889
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:54,420
And she can hit the road!

890
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,976
- We agree?
- 100% agreement.

891
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:00,010
Welcome aboard.

892
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,493
This case is good.

893
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:08,333
But it can be improved.

894
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:09,810
I know a few tricks.

895
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:12,615
We five days will have to move!

896
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:34,217

935
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:46,455
Not bad.

958
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:56,298
side by side.

959
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,692
A little later, we

closely followed by Chris
Mouse and his car.

963
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:07,331
Warning 5 to turn slippery.

964
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:09,372
Taking enormous trust Chris.

965
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:14,337
As we approach the second round,
Thorne remains at the top and widens the gap.

966
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:17,937
More  20 laps.
Heater also your tires.

967

I want!

971
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:50,900
This is not true!

972
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:54,329
<i> Paul, I'll release.</i>

973
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:56,452
- You double.
- Okay

974
01:22:58,940 --> 01:22:59,930
Now!

975
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:07,657
The World Racing took the lead!

976
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:09,738
Thorne never objected so little resistance.

977
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:12,131
Keep it , and is won.

978
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:14,292
Italian attack. Move!

979
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:15,337
I got this.

980
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:18,573
77 Danny Krueger, tries to escape
.

981
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:20,737
David Gallagher It doubles the outside.

982
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:28,978
Danny Krueger, for the team of Kendall,
strong back.

983
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:31,331
He tries to bend the Sport Mercedes
Eagle.

984
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:34,260
Krueger total control of your little Subaru.

985
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:35,940
And it happens!

986
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:42,374
<i> The guy in front of you brakes too early
7 </ i></i>

987
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:45,459
Yes, I noticed!
I will try to duplicate it.

988
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,096
<i> Super, keep it.</i>

989
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,177
Do not worry!

990
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,819
<i> This is not the Baja 1000 </ i></i>

991
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:22,181
They will read very easily. Calm
the game, the moment you forget you.

992
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:23,575
I'll remove it.

993
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:28,575
- No black flag?
- No, it was not purposeful.

994
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:31,699
- Seemed deliberate!
- This is the game This is the race.

995
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,493
- You were so.
- Do you remember?

996
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:37,900
<i> Over 10 towers / i></i>

997
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:41,650
The World
Racing dominated the first half of the race.

998
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:45,531
Do you remember me?

999
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:52,217
Danny Krueger found the place 4

1000
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,934
Robert Thorne and tries to bend.

1001
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:55,051
Come on!

1002
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:01,338
Unfortunately for Krueger,
Thorne has no intention of leaving it.

1003
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:04,570
Thorne took a turn too hard!

1004
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:11,172
Thorne is not already in the race.
It has a flat tire.

1005
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:12,097
Bad karma!

1006
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:14,053
Kendall's team is third.

1007
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:16,578
Danny Kruger made a spectacular comeback,

1008
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:20,012
but still faces the World Racing team cars.

1009
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:23,099
Other 8 laps and an incredible race.

1010
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:24,296
<i> Ah / i></i>

1011
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:27,015
Double  Paul and puts pressure on Enzo.

<i> And it happens fast / i></i>

1016
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,690
If the dump.

1017
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:58,140
He is always there.

1018
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:02,171
Over 4 rounds!

1019
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:03,617
Emits it!

1020
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:04,372
It was time.

01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:06,378
More Now! Identifies him!

1022
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:07,855
I'll be disqualified!

1023
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:08,971
But the team win.

1024
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,380
<i>-  What is happening / i>
- He wants to reach me?</i>

1025
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:25,935
Paul Lauricello becomes aggressive!

1026
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:32,220
<i> What happened / i></i>

1027
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:34,730

1029
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:40,660

, Enzo!

1033
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:53,658
Go, Enzo.
Show me what you got.

1034
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,220
More than 2 laps!

1035
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:12,016
Enzo Lauricello and Danny Krueger
leave the others in place.

1036
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:21,620
He sees you coming closer.

1037
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:23,700
<i> He knows where you are going to try to double
.</i>

1038
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:25,010
I tried on the 5 th round.

01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:27,655
<i> Care, is dangerous / i></i>

1040
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:33,821

That's it! Great, son!

1042
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:48,700
This is the last lap.

1043
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:51,779
Depose him at all costs, even?

1044
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:53,932
My tires are dead!

1045
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:56,257
Times in it, and immediately!
