1
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:53,576
It is the dawn of the 17th Century.

2
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:57,943
After the assassination of his father
the young King Louis XIII

3
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,506
ascends to the French throne.

4
00:01:02,768 --> 00:01:06,510
His once peaceful nation is surrounded
by enemies on all sides.

5
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:12,715
Within the borders of France itself
Cardinal Richelieu,

6
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,037
the King's adviser,

7
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:16,801
plots in secret to seize power for
himself.

8
00:01:16,783 --> 00:01:20,403
The inexperienced Louis
and his new bride, Queen Anne,

9
00:01:20,385 --> 00:01:22,727
find themselves without a single friend.

10
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,607
Europe is a powder keg waiting to
explode

11
00:01:25,589 --> 00:01:28,091
in a war that
will engulf the entire continent.

12
00:01:28,073 --> 00:01:32,735
And only a few men
can prevent the coming apocalypse...

13
00:01:32,757 --> 00:01:37,579
THE THREE MUSKETEERS

14
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:46,269
VENICE - ITALY

15
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,765
Halt!

16
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:04,145
Don't! Getting careless?

17
00:03:04,146 --> 00:03:06,267
The feeling is mutual.

18
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:15,595
For future reference

19
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,517
I love you,
would have been a more suitable reply.

20
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:24,925
- You could have just said hello.
- What would be the fun in that?

21
00:03:24,926 --> 00:03:26,407
How was the Bishop?

22
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:30,131
- Not as good as you.
- You are incorrigible.

23
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:32,973
I bet you say that to all the girls.

24
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,179
Lord!
Remember, I'm a lady.

25
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,901
Let me touch your breasts.
- Lord, Keep your hands to yourself!

26
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,180
"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth."

27
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:49,050
"as it is in heaven."

28
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,291
"Give us this day, our daily bread"

29
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,050
"and forgive us our tresspass"

30
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:55,372
"as we forgive those who tresspass against us. Amen."

31
00:04:01,143 --> 00:04:02,963
No more wine,
I'm telling you.

32
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:20,941
- What?
- Key.

33
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:30,629
You mean this key?

34
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:41,799
Who are you?

35
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:51,089
- I'm not a priest.
- I'm not really a lady.

36
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,611
I have ten minutes.

37
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,612
"There was once a partner and I."

38
00:04:57,613 --> 00:05:00,713
"We have incredible torts to pay."

39
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:03,014
"She hadn't know, she have it, involving a chicken"

40
00:05:03,015 --> 00:05:04,015
"a frog"

41
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:05,016
"and a rabbit..."

42
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,187
I expected more from a man
of your reputation.

43
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:09,188
Ah huh, oh!

44
00:05:09,249 --> 00:05:13,551
I don't suppose you have any idea
where I could find Athos and Aramis.

45
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:17,115
Never heard of them.

46
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:23,681
You, French spies,
you're very very arrogant. And foolish.

47
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:25,923
- And you're so...
- Sexy.

48
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,447
It's a wonder it took me so long to
catch you.

49
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:32,169
- Ahh, You didn't.
I Beg your Pardon?

50
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:35,893
You didn't... catch me.

51
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:38,615
And what exactly are you doing
here?

52
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:39,937
Catching you.

53
00:05:43,412 --> 00:05:44,498
(Chuckles)

54
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,239
Key.

55
00:06:07,465 --> 00:06:08,845
Vive la France.

56
00:06:09,507 --> 00:06:11,529
The CRYPT OF DA VINCI.

57
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:12,470
The Vinci's vault

58
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:16,893
Leonardo designed it to protect the plan of
his greatest inventions.

59
00:06:25,163 --> 00:06:26,543
Shall we?

60
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:33,069
Now.

61
00:06:51,429 --> 00:06:55,051
Your part's done! Won't you stay back in to the rally point.

62
00:06:55,052 --> 00:06:58,855
We came together, we leave together.

63
00:07:21,577 --> 00:07:23,559
- I'll go.
- Wait, wait.

64
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:26,121
Too easy.

65
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:46,741
Pressure plates
under the floor.

66
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:49,665
- I can scare the walls.
- Run a cable along the roof.

67
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,105
It could be booby trap too.

68
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:21,535
Well?
We don't have all night.

69
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:27,581
Are you absolutely certain there are no hidden
passages? And no secret tunnels?

70
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:29,223
- Positive, sir. It's a vault.

71
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:30,745
One way in. One way out.

72
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:34,747
Excellent! I want these
Musketeers dead. I want them dead!

73
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:37,231
The guards change
in 2 minutes. Maybe less.

74
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:39,833
Less!

75
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:46,719
What now,
"C'est la vie."?

76
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,081
No.

77
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:50,123
Contingency plan.

78
00:08:52,787 --> 00:08:54,167
Got it.

79
00:09:02,677 --> 00:09:04,697
Athos, you do know what's
up there?

80
00:09:04,698 --> 00:09:06,059
Yes, hold your breath!

81
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:26,359
Hey, hey! Get back down there!
Now!

82
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,773
- Do exhale!
- I love you.

83
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:44,937
I hate to ruin the mood

84
00:09:44,938 --> 00:09:47,259
but perhaps we can go elsewhere.

85
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,780
I think the first time
Father is right.

86
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,870
- All for one.
- One for all.

87
00:10:03,258 --> 00:10:04,916
So what's next?

88
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:07,678
- Back to Paris, I guess.
- And then what?

89
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,280
Wherever they send us. Whatever
France needs.

90
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:12,322
It's who we are. It's what we do.

91
00:10:12,323 --> 00:10:15,806
I do love you.

92
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:17,248
I know.

93
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:21,090
Then please try to understand. This
isn't personal.

94
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:23,214
It's ... strictly
business.

95
00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:26,976
He made me a better offer

96
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,386
Ah Athos!

97
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,828
Buckingham.

98
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:49,681
A toxin.

99
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,207
In case you are wondering,
it wasn't in your drink.

100
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,609
It was on
your cup.

101
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,613
Inactive until it came in
contact with the liquid.

102
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:08,259
Don't worry.
It isn't fatal.

103
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,065
Although
I suspect part of you wishes it was.

104
00:11:14,283 --> 00:11:17,389
You take all the risk and I get the
reward.

105
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,551
Hardly seems fair.

106
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:24,957
Just so you don't leave empty handed,
a word of advice.

107
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:34,525
Trust no one.
Especially women.

108
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:37,209
You'll live longer.

109
00:11:44,313 --> 00:11:48,099
Telling him you loved him right
before you betrayed him.

110
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,745
I must say, that was cruel,
even by my standards.

111
00:11:54,683 --> 00:11:57,627
I only took away his prize.

112
00:11:57,628 --> 00:12:00,831
You... took a lot more than that.

113
00:12:08,737 --> 00:12:13,325
At last, the war machine.

114
00:12:24,073 --> 00:12:27,497
ONE YEAR LATER

115
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:55,565
Look down.

116
00:12:56,865 --> 00:13:00,249
It's a trick that an old
friend taught me.

117
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,253
Your opponent will not always be
as noble as you.

118
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:09,499
Remember that, and I have nothing left to teach you.

119
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,939
I doubt that, Father.

120
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:14,865
Ah, keep it.

121
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:19,147
It's passed down from generation to generation,
from father to son.

122
00:13:19,148 --> 00:13:21,151
It's yours now.

123
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:28,237
The weapon of a musketeer.

124
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:32,041
The real weapon of a musketeer,
is here.

125
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:34,563
All for one.

126
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,005
And one for all.

127
00:13:37,006 --> 00:13:39,007
You remind me of somebody.

128
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:41,529
Let me guess.
You...

129
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,535
No, no. The man I wish I was
when I was your age.

130
00:13:47,313 --> 00:13:50,539
Well, you should really be on your way.

131
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,861
Take this purse.
There's 15 crowns in it.

132
00:13:53,862 --> 00:13:55,463
It's enough to get
you to Paris.

133
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:57,547
And you'll need a mount.

134
00:13:57,548 --> 00:13:59,747
Your mother is insisting that
you take Buttercup.

135
00:13:59,748 --> 00:14:03,833
- I know it's not much, and...
- It's plenty.

136
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:12,319
Take care of yourself, my son. Try
not to get into any fights.

137
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,005
If I'm to be a Musketeer, I think I
might have to do a little bit of fighting.

138
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:20,327
Well, stay at the back if you can.
- Yes, mother.

139
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:21,969
Just one more piece of advice.

140
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,531
I know, I know.
Don't get in any trouble.

141
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:26,895
Wrong!
Get into trouble.

142
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:29,017
Make mistakes.

143
00:14:30,115 --> 00:14:32,739
Fight, love, live.

144
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:40,507
And remember, always. You're a
Gascon. And our son.

145
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:44,591
Now, go!
Go!

146
00:15:08,071 --> 00:15:10,897
AFTER 3 DAYS

147
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:25,871
In the name of God, what kind of
beast is that?

148
00:15:25,872 --> 00:15:29,155
And the beast that he is riding
doesn't have much a deal.

149
00:15:29,156 --> 00:15:30,517
Ostler!

150
00:15:30,518 --> 00:15:32,719
See that my horse is
watered and fed!

151
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,241
Oh it's a horse, is it?

152
00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:37,523
My friends here thought
it was a cow.

153
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:42,369
Excuse me.

154
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,091
See, I know you men are just kidding
around.

155
00:15:45,092 --> 00:15:49,655
Buttercup... well, she gets a little sensitive.

156
00:15:51,155 --> 00:15:53,379
I'm afraid I
must ask you to apologize.

157
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,943
Well I'm afraid, I'm not in the habit of apologizing
to Gascon yokels.

158
00:15:57,944 --> 00:16:01,827
Not to me.
To my horse.

159
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:07,753
You've hurt her feelings.

160
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:12,037
And if I don't?

161
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:15,079
I shall have to kill you.

162
00:16:25,349 --> 00:16:27,371
You shot me!

163
00:16:27,372 --> 00:16:29,695
Most observant of you, young man.

164
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:33,777
But the real question is:
Why are you not dead?

165
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:37,783
Flesh wound.
The sight must be odd.

166
00:16:37,784 --> 00:16:39,343
Who takes care of my business?

167
00:16:39,344 --> 00:16:42,227
Ah Captain Rochefort, I...

168
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:48,313
Don't want to dirty my blade
with peasant blood.

169
00:16:48,971 --> 00:16:51,995
So, boy.
Consider it as a lesson.

170
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:54,079
His last...

171
00:16:55,217 --> 00:16:56,761
No.

172
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:02,767
He's too pretty for that.

173
00:17:03,745 --> 00:17:06,451
As you wish... Milady.

174
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:12,015
Rochefort, come.
We are expecting Paris.

175
00:17:12,016 --> 00:17:13,777
Thank you.

176
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,897
Make way!

177
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:42,985
Ohh you had enough.

178
00:18:44,965 --> 00:18:47,109
Where's my mug?

179
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,469
Excuse me!

180
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:53,795
- You think you're better than me?
- No.

181
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:59,081
- All for one.
- Excuse me.

182
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:03,005
- Sorry, I'm sorry!
- Are you blind?

183
00:19:03,006 --> 00:19:05,087
Look, I'm chasing after a man who insulted
my horse and

184
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:06,447
tried to kill me!
So let me go.

185
00:19:06,448 --> 00:19:09,411
That's not good enough. Spoke my
drink, ruined my shirt.

186
00:19:09,412 --> 00:19:10,813
I am in a hurry.

187
00:19:13,814 --> 00:19:15,900
Ah here, 10 suite.

188
00:19:15,995 --> 00:19:17,899
Who do you think you're talking to?

189
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,861
The town drunk,
by smell of you.

190
00:19:19,862 --> 00:19:21,823
And that my boy is a fighting to.

191
00:19:22,601 --> 00:19:25,665
- What are you saying exactly?
- Blind and deaf.

192
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,429
Fortunately for you,
I'm somewhat of a doctor.

193
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,031
Great! When can you fit me in?

194
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:32,873
2 o'clock, Cooper's Yard,
St. Germain.

195
00:19:32,874 --> 00:19:34,235
I'll be there.

196
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:38,157
Excuse me.

197
00:19:38,158 --> 00:19:39,719
I just can't decide.

198
00:19:39,718 --> 00:19:44,645
Well, if I might point out, this
does make you look very dignified.

199
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:48,209
Whereas the blue one brings out
your dashing side.

200
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,129
Equally important.

201
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,373
Dignified. Dashing.

202
00:19:53,374 --> 00:19:56,857
In the words
of King Solomon: I'll take both!

203
00:19:56,858 --> 00:19:58,859
A most excellent choice, sir!

204
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:05,585
Darling, you spoil me.
I don't know how will I ever repay you?

205
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:07,907
Watch yourself!

206
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:10,631
My apologies! Matter of life and
death! Won't happen again!

207
00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:13,713
- I believe you dropped this.
- This isn't mine

208
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,795
I saw the lady hands it to you,
I'm not blind.

209
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:18,359
Are you implying that I take
money from this woman?

210
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,321
Are you saying that I cannot
afford to pay for my own wardrobe?

211
00:20:21,322 --> 00:20:22,723
Do you know who I am?

212
00:20:22,724 --> 00:20:24,845
- Do you know who I am?
- No.

213
00:20:24,846 --> 00:20:26,365
Then we're even.

214
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:29,289
You're in luck, boy.

215
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,131
Ordinarily, I
would slaughter you on the spot

216
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:34,253
but this is a brand new jacket.

217
00:20:34,254 --> 00:20:38,057
Cooper's Yard,
St. Germain, 1 o'clock.

218
00:20:38,058 --> 00:20:40,259
I suggest you dress for a funeral.

219
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,621
What?!

220
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,243
What the hell?!

221
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:06,605
Five francs?!

222
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:13,091
- Hey! Hey! What is this?!
- It's a citation.

223
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,733
It's a ticket.

224
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:19,017
Failure to remove animal
bowel movements from public area.

225
00:21:19,018 --> 00:21:20,499
French?

226
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,581
Your horse to the dumped on the street.

227
00:21:24,921 --> 00:21:26,465
You're joking!

228
00:21:26,466 --> 00:21:28,465
It's what they all say.

229
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,829
You know what?

230
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:36,595
Cooper's Yard,
St. Germain, 2 o'clock.

231
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:42,279
Strange boy.

232
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,821
Milady de Winter!

233
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:24,201
A close game, your Eminence.

234
00:22:24,202 --> 00:22:25,523
- Hmm!
- Who's the opponent?

235
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:26,803
Myself.

236
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,765
No one else proved to
be a sufficient challenge.

237
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,895
Hmm, what news of England?

238
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:40,497
He's coming.

239
00:22:41,435 --> 00:22:42,819
Buckingham?

240
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,821
hmm, and?...

241
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,503
and?

242
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:48,745
He built it.

243
00:22:49,603 --> 00:22:51,267
The war machine.

244
00:22:51,268 --> 00:22:53,589
And he doesn't question
your loyalty?

245
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,991
He thinks he's so cunning.

246
00:22:56,611 --> 00:22:58,155
so evil.

247
00:22:58,156 --> 00:23:00,395
Evil is just a point of view.

248
00:23:01,615 --> 00:23:03,679
Ah, Richelieu.

249
00:23:08,543 --> 00:23:10,847
This lady is the messenger
England?

250
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,289
Your Majesty is
exceptionally alert.

251
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:18,333
So, ah Madame.

252
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:21,137
War at Buckingham?

253
00:23:22,397 --> 00:23:23,859
Majesty?

254
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:26,341
What's he wearing these days?

255
00:23:27,521 --> 00:23:29,785
Green, Your Majesty.

256
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:31,787
Green?

257
00:23:31,788 --> 00:23:33,989
Very interesting.

258
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,633
And you have the goal to recommend blue?

259
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:39,315
Of course it should be green.

260
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:43,959
Why am
I surrounded by incompetent idiots?

261
00:23:44,615 --> 00:23:49,341
Green, green, green! Do I have to do it everyday myself...

262
00:24:00,993 --> 00:24:04,379
Ah there you are.
Shall we get to it?

263
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,341
So are you eager to meet your maker?

264
00:24:07,342 --> 00:24:10,665
- I have other appointments.
- You'll miss them, I'm afraid.

265
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,587
Ah, I'll try my best to be on time.

266
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:15,029
My seconds.

267
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,591
You.

268
00:24:16,592 --> 00:24:18,513
You'll fighting this rascal?

269
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:24,479
My appointments. One o'clock. Two o'clock.

270
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:27,881
How long have you been in Paris?

271
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,525
- Arrived this morning.
- You have been busy.

272
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:33,167
Patience is not one of my virtues

273
00:24:33,168 --> 00:24:34,849
Well neither of good manners.

274
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,171
Wait for your turn, old man.

275
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:42,777
What would you like me to put in your headstone?
Little shit?

276
00:24:42,778 --> 00:24:46,539
D'Artagnan.

277
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:50,263
I'm Athos. This is Porthos and Aramis.

278
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,909
The Three Musketeers.

279
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,269
I've heard of you.

280
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,393
From my father, a Musketeer himself.

281
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:03,075
In fact,
I came to Paris to be one of you.

282
00:25:03,076 --> 00:25:06,319
- I'm afraid you're a little late.
- What happened?

283
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,201
Ohh Bad mission. Budget cuts.

284
00:25:09,202 --> 00:25:11,805
The Cardinal. Progress. Take your pick.

285
00:25:13,505 --> 00:25:16,089
Well, welcome to Paris.

286
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,891
Pity we'll have to kill you.

287
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:23,255
Well, if I can't become a Musketeer,
I might as well fight one.

288
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:25,139
Or three!

289
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:28,821
Kill him already. It's lunchtime
and I'm starving.

290
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:41,401
Halt!

291
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:45,445
Ahh Jussac!

292
00:25:45,446 --> 00:25:49,571
Well, well, well.
How the mighty have fallen.

293
00:25:49,572 --> 00:25:52,733
Duelling in defiance of the edicts?

294
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:55,897
You got tired of rolling
peddlers for spare change?

295
00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:02,666
Now, surrender your
weapons and come along with us.

296
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:03,863
Surround it!

297
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:07,467
Unless, of course, you'd rather resist.

298
00:26:07,468 --> 00:26:08,500
New plan.

299
00:26:09,991 --> 00:26:12,833
Kill the boy, kick their
asses, and then go get some lunch.

300
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:14,715
I can do them as an exercise.

301
00:26:23,243 --> 00:26:24,965
You were saying?

302
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:29,087
On the other hand, discretion is
the better part of valor.

303
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:32,131
You are the musketeers.
- Wrong.

304
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:35,975
We were the musketeers,
now we're just... us.

305
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:51,271
Rochefort.

306
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,639
Shall we?

307
00:27:57,937 --> 00:27:59,577
Finish them off.

308
00:28:03,143 --> 00:28:04,823
Let's even the odds.

309
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:10,927
Enjoying the show?

310
00:29:10,928 --> 00:29:12,289
- You!
- Watch out!

311
00:29:29,547 --> 00:29:31,267
You didn't answer my question.

312
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:35,029
- Are you always this cocky?
- Only on Tuesdays.

313
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:41,437
And whenever
beautiful women are involved.

314
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:42,799
Damn you!

315
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:48,803
Can't you see we're trying to have a
conversation?

316
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:06,261
What is your name?

317
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:09,783
Constance.

318
00:30:09,784 --> 00:30:13,347
Constance... sounds very steadfast.

319
00:30:13,348 --> 00:30:15,349
A quality you seem to know little
about.

320
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,151
Oh I beg to differ.

321
00:30:17,152 --> 00:30:19,433
Deep down behind me, a hopeless romantic.

322
00:30:20,597 --> 00:30:21,995
Beg for more?

323
00:30:39,615 --> 00:30:41,415
I forgot what
it feels like.

324
00:30:42,097 --> 00:30:43,457
We all have.

325
00:30:46,781 --> 00:30:48,461
The name is D'Artagnan.

326
00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:52,065
You must come from
a very small town.

327
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:53,387
How did you know?

328
00:30:53,388 --> 00:30:56,631
Lines like yours might actually work
there. This is Paris.

329
00:30:56,632 --> 00:30:58,951
I suggest you stick to swordplay.

330
00:30:58,952 --> 00:31:03,877
In the battle of
wits you, Sir, are unarmed.

331
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:10,603
She's right lad.

332
00:31:10,604 --> 00:31:13,527
The ladies of Paris
are infinitely more complicated.

333
00:31:13,528 --> 00:31:15,409
They have a thousand ways of saying no,

334
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,329
and only some of them mean yes.

335
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,371
I hate to ruin the mood,
but they will be back.

336
00:31:19,372 --> 00:31:21,615
And unless you wish to
fight the entire army.

337
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:26,459
Elsewhere.

338
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,460
So now, what?

339
00:31:32,587 --> 00:31:34,027
Do we pick up
where we left off?

340
00:31:34,028 --> 00:31:35,987
I think there's been enough
fighting for one day.

341
00:31:35,988 --> 00:31:38,711
Besides, any man who is an enemy of Rochefort

342
00:31:38,712 --> 00:31:40,433
is a friend of mine!
- Who's Rochefort?

343
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:41,953
Captain of the Cardinal's Guards.

344
00:31:42,677 --> 00:31:45,117
The right hand of the most powerful man
in France.

345
00:31:45,118 --> 00:31:48,159
Rochefort, is the most feared swordsman in Europe.

346
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,203
You certainly know how to
pick your fights.

347
00:31:50,845 --> 00:31:53,445
Like I said, he insulted my horse.

348
00:31:55,889 --> 00:31:59,091
You're reckless,
arrogant, impetuous

349
00:31:59,092 --> 00:32:02,013
and probably be dead by sundown.
But I like you lad.

350
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,417
- Where are you staying?
- No idea.

351
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:08,901
Ah, do you have any money?

352
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:15,187
Well, good sir,
you and your fine stead

353
00:32:15,188 --> 00:32:19,189
are welcome
in our humble home.

354
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,511
For the time being.

355
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:24,195
Fine... He's in there.

356
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,959
Come on.

357
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:30,761
What should we drink to?

358
00:32:32,245 --> 00:32:34,807
- How about the King?
- He's a child.

359
00:32:34,808 --> 00:32:38,129
The Cardinal rules, all but in name.
We might as well drink to him.

360
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:41,493
To France.

361
00:32:41,494 --> 00:32:44,415
We served it. Fought for it. Bled
for it. Look where it got us.

362
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,739
Friendship, Love.

363
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,501
Word of advice, boy. Trust no one.

364
00:32:53,387 --> 00:32:55,785
There must be something you still
believe in.

365
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:57,829
This...

366
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:00,111
This...

367
00:33:01,073 --> 00:33:02,473
And this.

368
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:08,839
Anyone who tells you otherwise is either a
fool or trying to sell you something.

369
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:20,129
I know Athos may seem cold and
unfriendly, but don't let it fool you.

370
00:33:20,893 --> 00:33:24,015
- Deep down...
- He really is cold and unfriendly.

371
00:33:24,777 --> 00:33:26,977
What happened to him?

372
00:33:26,978 --> 00:33:29,579
What happens to any man? A woman.

373
00:33:31,183 --> 00:33:34,343
You know, I do not want to offend anyway,

374
00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:37,347
but I thought you were
a little bit more...

375
00:33:38,189 --> 00:33:39,669
Heroic.

376
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:45,835
What my esteemed colleague was trying
to say in his own way

377
00:33:45,797 --> 00:33:51,039
is that we are... obsolete.

378
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,363
We are warriors,
but there's no war for us to fight.

379
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,285
So we
drink and brawl

380
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:58,567
and quarrel with
Cardinal's Guards and then we drink some more.

381
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:02,771
What we need is a great cause,

382
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,495
but there are no great causes left.

383
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:08,017
Which is why I keep telling you it's not too late

384
00:34:08,018 --> 00:34:09,697
to do that priest thing again.

385
00:34:09,698 --> 00:34:11,621
Beats working for the city.

386
00:34:11,622 --> 00:34:14,463
Free booze at wakes and weddings.
And then, there's the nuns...

387
00:34:14,464 --> 00:34:16,545
- You were a priest?
- Until I realized

388
00:34:16,546 --> 00:34:18,907
being a man of God
and being a man of the cloth

389
00:34:18,908 --> 00:34:20,829
aren't always the same thing.

390
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,753
And yet, he still says prayers for those
he kills.

391
00:34:23,754 --> 00:34:25,235
Old habit.

392
00:34:25,236 --> 00:34:27,795
On the contrary. The men I kill deserve
to die.

393
00:34:28,759 --> 00:34:30,799
But they also deserve peace.

394
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,081
After all, they must have believed in
something.

395
00:34:33,803 --> 00:34:37,005
We all do. Even the worst of us.

396
00:34:37,006 --> 00:34:38,687
I'll drink to that.

397
00:34:40,209 --> 00:34:42,291
Planchet!
More wine!

398
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Planchet!

399
00:34:46,175 --> 00:34:52,219
Sorry Sirs,
I'm afraid there's none left.

400
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,220
You've drunk a lot.

401
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:54,260
What sort of answer's that?

402
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:56,825
Go get some more, man!

403
00:34:56,826 --> 00:34:59,067
Very good sir.
It's just... I can't sir...

404
00:34:59,068 --> 00:35:02,820
We've...
we've ran out of money.

405
00:35:04,953 --> 00:35:06,955
Planchet, what are you?

406
00:35:07,717 --> 00:35:09,957
- Completes a lot of waste of space sir.
- And?

407
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:12,200
- As much as use as a fart in a bottle, sir.
- Right.

408
00:35:12,281 --> 00:35:16,323
In short sir, a total tits sir.
But I can't work bleedy miracles.

409
00:35:16,285 --> 00:35:17,645
Planchet.

410
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,200
Ohh..ohh..

411
00:35:23,011 --> 00:35:26,333
Thank you very much, sir.
That's, that's incredibly generous

412
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:30,457
for such a handsome, young man.
Thank you very very much.

413
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:33,942
Will you, will you be staying here tonight?

414
00:35:33,943 --> 00:35:35,943
He'll be taking your bed Planchet.

415
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:40,707
Ugh, right, so I'll be sleeping...
- You may take the balcony.

416
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:43,189
Outside? On the balcony outside,
in the cold?

417
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,513
With birds shitting
on my head all night?

418
00:35:46,514 --> 00:35:48,395
Great! Uhm
Can I just say...

419
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,877
- Wine, wine, wine, wine
- Yes, of course.

420
00:35:50,878 --> 00:35:53,159
- Wine as he says.
- Wine, wine, wine, wine

421
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,103
Check.

422
00:36:17,104 --> 00:36:19,065
This is a ridiculous game.

423
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:22,069
Surely the King should be the most
powerful piece?

424
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:25,865
The King is the most important piece,
but he's vulnerable.

425
00:36:25,866 --> 00:36:27,273
He needs protection.

426
00:36:27,274 --> 00:36:29,315
May I suggest you castle him?

427
00:36:36,803 --> 00:36:38,685
Checkmate.

428
00:36:43,611 --> 00:36:46,291
There! What do you think about?

429
00:36:46,975 --> 00:36:49,495
Your Majesty is a force of nature.

430
00:36:50,217 --> 00:36:53,859
- Took you by surprise, eh?
- Yes, Indeed, you did.

431
00:36:55,943 --> 00:36:58,503
May we
speak a little about foreign policy?

432
00:36:58,504 --> 00:37:00,065
It's not about Buckingham, is it?

433
00:37:00,065 --> 00:37:04,791
I'm afraid it is. He's arriving in Paris
tomorrow.

434
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:07,631
His master, King James, has
agreed to hear our

435
00:37:07,632 --> 00:37:10,235
peace proposal.
- Good, good.

436
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:13,357
It's better
than to mess with me then!

437
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:15,841
There's also another matter.

438
00:37:15,842 --> 00:37:21,325
A dangerous rivalry has sprung between your Majesty's
Musketeers and my personal Guards.

439
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:25,849
- Who was involved?
- Athos, Porthos and Aramis.

440
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:28,533
The usual suspects.

441
00:37:28,534 --> 00:37:31,135
And a young man called D'Artagnan.

442
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:36,341
I have summoned them to the palace
so that your majesty can punish them severely.

443
00:37:56,761 --> 00:37:58,483
His Majesty, the King

444
00:37:59,245 --> 00:38:00,965
Well, well, well.

445
00:38:04,129 --> 00:38:06,089
Brawling with the
Cardinal's Guards.

446
00:38:06,813 --> 00:38:08,600
That's very bad,

447
00:38:08,613 --> 00:38:10,613
What
have you got to say for yourselves?

448
00:38:10,614 --> 00:38:13,937
- We..
- Humbly beg your pardon, your Majesty.

449
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:17,061
Yes, yes, I should hope so too.

450
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:20,543
So tell me, how
many were involved in the altercation?

451
00:38:20,544 --> 00:38:24,147
There were 4 of us against 40 of them, your Majesty

452
00:38:24,148 --> 00:38:26,109
4 is to 40?

453
00:38:28,313 --> 00:38:30,675
And you beat
them like a drum?!

454
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:35,559
And yes, you shall have to be reprimanded, of
course. Most harshly,

455
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,161
- I'm afraid. You understand that, don't you?
- We do, your Majesty.

456
00:38:38,162 --> 00:38:39,721
Your Majesty: the Queen.

457
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:49,213
Anne.

458
00:38:49,214 --> 00:38:51,053
What a pleasant surprise.

459
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:54,217
My ladies and I wanted to see the
valiant Musketeers

460
00:38:54,218 --> 00:38:56,539
who stood against
Cardinal's Guards.

461
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,103
Four against
forty. Or was it four hundred?

462
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:04,145
Just forty, your Majesty.
It was an off day.

463
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,429
That's my Musketeers for you!

464
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:10,031
By the time they write songs about
them, it'll be four thousand!

465
00:39:10,032 --> 00:39:12,073
I hope you won't be too harsh with
them.

466
00:39:12,677 --> 00:39:15,037
After all, boys will be boys.

467
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:22,363
You must be D'Artagnan.

468
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:26,689
My lady in waiting has told me about how
brave and dashing you are, yesterday.

469
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:30,131
But you must try not to be
so reckless.

470
00:39:30,132 --> 00:39:32,415
Can't help myself, your Majesty.

471
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:34,655
- Your Majesty, the culprits...
- Ah, yes, yes.

472
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,656
Ahm..

473
00:39:36,781 --> 00:39:38,181
Stand up, then.

474
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,907
Athos.

475
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:48,469
Porthos.

476
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,071
Aramis.

477
00:39:52,315 --> 00:39:57,839
Forgive me for saying this D'Artagnan, but uhm, it looked you're
little undressed.

478
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:01,523
My father is a poor man, your
Majesty.

479
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:03,405
A former Musketeer as well.

480
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:06,527
These are the only clothes I have.

481
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:09,811
My Lord.
We must not rectify that.

482
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:13,735
Can't have my Musketeers or a son of one,
looking like tramps.

483
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:18,099
New suits all
round! I think..

484
00:40:19,061 --> 00:40:20,501
Yes, you'll see to that, Cardinal?

485
00:40:21,145 --> 00:40:26,427
And a yes, I think a purse of gold for each as
a reward for your courage.

486
00:40:26,428 --> 00:40:28,069
You'll see
to that as well, Cardinal?

487
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:32,553
Oh, yes before I forget, no more
fighting with his Eminence's Guards, hm?

488
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:38,719
or there will be none of them left!

489
00:40:41,683 --> 00:40:43,723
Your Majesty, might I suggest a more...

490
00:40:43,724 --> 00:40:45,605
Forgive my impudence, Cardinal,

491
00:40:45,606 --> 00:40:48,327
but I doubt the King requires your advice in
this matter.

492
00:40:48,328 --> 00:40:49,929
After all, they are his
Musketeers.

493
00:40:50,853 --> 00:40:52,613
Good day, gentlemen.

494
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,099
Well now, off with you, rascals.

495
00:41:00,901 --> 00:41:05,425
But be there for the parade tomorrow.
With new suits on.

496
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:11,030
I'm tired of this world, children.

497
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:13,162
It's time to make our move.

498
00:41:13,163 --> 00:41:16,200
We shall use Buckingham as a rival to our advantage.

499
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,797
During his visit, we we'll reveal

500
00:41:18,798 --> 00:41:21,921
that he arranged a secret rendezvouz with the queen.

501
00:41:22,685 --> 00:41:25,965
May I inquire how your
Eminence has uncovered the scandalous affair?

502
00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:30,209
By reading Buckingham's letters to
the Queen. Found in her possession.

503
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:32,731
Written in Buckingham's hand

504
00:41:32,732 --> 00:41:34,333
and authenticated by his seal?

505
00:41:34,334 --> 00:41:37,775
A woman of your talents should have
no trouble procuring either.

506
00:41:37,776 --> 00:41:40,059
Your Eminence is too kind.

507
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,501
However, I doubt that the King will accept
such letters

508
00:41:42,502 --> 00:41:46,265
as definitive proof of
his wife's indiscretion.

509
00:41:47,189 --> 00:41:50,309
Then we shall provide him with
something a bit more... substantial.

510
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:55,033
A piece of the queen's jewelry given to
Buckingham as a token of affection.

511
00:41:55,715 --> 00:41:57,435
Buckingham will be humiliated.

512
00:41:57,436 --> 00:42:01,319
- The King will be outraged.
- The Queen will be executed.

513
00:42:01,961 --> 00:42:04,883
France will have no
choice but to go to war.

514
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:08,365
And in times like these

515
00:42:08,366 --> 00:42:10,769
prince will naturally turn
to a stronger leader.

516
00:42:11,933 --> 00:42:17,655
Someone better equipped to rule the nation
than a cuckolded teenager with a grudge.

517
00:42:17,656 --> 00:42:18,660
Hhm!

518
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:23,903
Someone like your Eminence.

519
00:42:36,477 --> 00:42:37,875
Turn around!

520
00:42:54,855 --> 00:42:58,215
Where is he, then?
He's just a pole in manners.

521
00:43:39,297 --> 00:43:40,697
Damn his impudence!

522
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:44,061
What is that
thing called anyway, Richelieu?

523
00:43:45,183 --> 00:43:47,463
An airship, your Majesty.

524
00:43:54,433 --> 00:43:57,513
- Why don't I have one of those?
- An oversight on our part.

525
00:43:57,514 --> 00:44:00,917
Right, right. Well, build me one.

526
00:44:15,093 --> 00:44:16,531
(Tie the strings)

527
00:44:36,353 --> 00:44:37,753
Buckingham.

528
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,435
Blue.

529
00:44:48,685 --> 00:44:50,205
Your Majesty.

530
00:44:51,127 --> 00:44:53,087
Love the outfit.

531
00:44:53,088 --> 00:44:56,611
Very... retro. We were all wearing
those in London.

532
00:44:56,613 --> 00:45:00,213
When was it?
Last year? or the year before.

533
00:45:01,777 --> 00:45:05,579
Lord Buckingham. I trust your journey
wasn't too uncomfortable.

534
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,623
Not at all.
No, on the contrary.

535
00:45:08,624 --> 00:45:12,265
Handles like a dream and
keeps me one step closer to heaven.

536
00:45:13,709 --> 00:45:15,069
Cardinal.

537
00:45:19,995 --> 00:45:25,319
Of course, being a servant of God,
you have no need for such crude devices.

538
00:45:25,921 --> 00:45:27,281
The King James is most

539
00:45:27,282 --> 00:45:28,963
eager to hear your peace proposal.

540
00:45:28,964 --> 00:45:30,803
- Lord Buckingham.
- Anne.

541
00:45:31,527 --> 00:45:32,927
Your Majesty.

542
00:45:32,928 --> 00:45:34,929
I must say your beauty is

543
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:37,491
far more radiant than I remember.

544
00:45:37,492 --> 00:45:39,733
- You've met before?
- A long time ago.

545
00:45:39,734 --> 00:45:43,015
An evening I shall cherish, forever.

546
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:47,221
Right.
Well, Shall we?

547
00:45:51,747 --> 00:45:56,509
- Now, this is a pleasant surprise.
- Hm, another acquaintance of yours, I see.

548
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:57,991
We've met, yes.

549
00:45:57,992 --> 00:46:02,475
As I recall, last I saw you, you
were on your knees as well.

550
00:46:02,476 --> 00:46:05,079
Most unfortunate habit.

551
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,041
That habit I shall have to break during our
next encounter.

552
00:46:09,565 --> 00:46:11,325
I look forward to it.

553
00:46:11,326 --> 00:46:14,527
In the meantime,
Shall we talk peace?

554
00:46:20,455 --> 00:46:23,095
You must pass me the name of your
interior decorator.

555
00:46:24,499 --> 00:46:26,539
- Wine?
- I don't drink.

556
00:46:27,261 --> 00:46:30,743
What about the nice bottle of
Bordeaux in your middle left hand drawer.

557
00:46:31,825 --> 00:46:34,467
You must pass me the name of your
spy in the palace.

558
00:46:35,149 --> 00:46:36,749
And yours in mine.

559
00:46:39,273 --> 00:46:42,315
England cannot afford
a war on two fronts.

560
00:46:42,316 --> 00:46:45,037
Both our
nations have stretch to breaking point.

561
00:46:45,038 --> 00:46:48,641
A peace treaty would be
of immense strategic advantage.

562
00:46:49,403 --> 00:46:53,045
- Whose advantage
- Yours.
- Ours.

563
00:46:53,807 --> 00:46:59,811
I have a feeling my new war machines
may address the balance.

564
00:47:01,295 --> 00:47:03,255
Very impressive.

565
00:47:20,033 --> 00:47:22,073
Stay where you are!
This is the Queen's wing.

566
00:47:22,074 --> 00:47:24,035
You can't be up here.
- Oh, thank goodness.

567
00:47:24,036 --> 00:47:28,719
I got so lost. I took the wrong turn
and the door slammed behind me.

568
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:33,323
Oh, I've been trapped up here,
in the sun's heat.

569
00:47:33,324 --> 00:47:35,487
- It's going to be alright.
- I'm gonna faint.

570
00:47:35,488 --> 00:47:38,369
- You're in safe hands.
- Oh, thank you.

571
00:48:03,275 --> 00:48:05,595
You can't shoot. They'll hear you.

572
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:08,057
Ssshh..

573
00:48:22,773 --> 00:48:26,217
Constance! Constance!
Hey, hey! Excuse me!

574
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:29,939
Pardon, Your Majesty.
This only will take a moment.

575
00:48:32,306 --> 00:48:33,822
What are you doing here?

576
00:48:34,626 --> 00:48:37,386
His Majesty wants to have a word with me.
Imagine that.

577
00:48:37,387 --> 00:48:39,988
Yes, lovely. Now, excuse me.

578
00:48:39,989 --> 00:48:41,348
I- I was...

579
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:45,600
I was thinking, after I'm finished with His Majesty
maybe, we could talk?

580
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,274
I can't. I have plans.

581
00:48:47,275 --> 00:48:48,875
How about tomorrow?

582
00:48:48,876 --> 00:48:49,878
- I have another plans.

583
00:48:49,879 --> 00:48:51,640
- Well, I...
- Look, D'Artagnan.

584
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:53,640
You may have a new sets of clothes
and the King's favor

585
00:48:53,641 --> 00:48:56,564
but you still act like
a clumsy country boy.

586
00:48:56,565 --> 00:48:57,926
Now, excuse me.

587
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,400
Two summons in two days?
Your Majesty's all of me.

588
00:49:33,401 --> 00:49:36,122
No, cut that!
Please think about it.

589
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:38,566
You're a good fellow,
D'Artagnan.

590
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:44,050
So, ah how are the ladies
treating these days?

591
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:46,294
- I can't complain.
- Yes, indeed.

592
00:49:46,295 --> 00:49:49,176
Well, same here, of course.
The thing is...

593
00:49:51,542 --> 00:49:54,060
I got this... friend.

594
00:49:55,266 --> 00:49:57,624
Just a regular child,
like you and me.

595
00:49:57,625 --> 00:49:59,106
He got married very young.

596
00:49:59,107 --> 00:50:01,588
Political alliance,
arranged marriage.

597
00:50:01,592 --> 00:50:03,110
You know, the sort of thing.

598
00:50:03,111 --> 00:50:05,832
- Hardly knew the girl.
- But he likes her?

599
00:50:06,596 --> 00:50:09,916
Oh, ah yes, hhm hhm. Very much!

600
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:11,798
Well, does she like him?

601
00:50:11,799 --> 00:50:15,402
Well, it's funny you should say that.
That's the problem.

602
00:50:15,403 --> 00:50:17,604
He's uhm. He's not sure.

603
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:22,288
He just feels like a fool
when he's around her.

604
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:26,252
He's always saying the wrong thing.
Palm sweating.

605
00:50:26,253 --> 00:50:29,296
The heart's pumping so loud.
He's afraid, she might hear it.

606
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,656
It's torture just to look at.

607
00:50:32,302 --> 00:50:35,702
- Have you ever felt this way?
- Not until recently.

608
00:50:36,906 --> 00:50:38,944
So- so...
What do we do?

609
00:50:38,945 --> 00:50:41,588
I mean, my friend.
What is he do?

610
00:50:43,032 --> 00:50:45,350
He should speak his heart.

611
00:50:46,116 --> 00:50:49,154
Being someone who cares for her
and isn't afraid to show it.

612
00:50:52,242 --> 00:50:54,040
Being himself.

613
00:50:54,044 --> 00:50:56,000
Oh that's what I told him.

614
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:58,124
Then he's definitely lucky.

615
00:50:58,125 --> 00:51:00,846
After all, he does have
You Majesty as a friend.

616
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,608
Yes, yes.

617
00:51:03,252 --> 00:51:04,730
It's good to have friends.

618
00:51:08,294 --> 00:51:10,332
Will you excuse me
for just one moment?

619
00:51:11,456 --> 00:51:13,094
(I don't believe it.)

620
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:21,824
How are you?

621
00:51:21,825 --> 00:51:23,224
Very well.

622
00:51:25,552 --> 00:51:26,988
I'm wearing blue.

623
00:51:27,954 --> 00:51:29,950
And you're very handsome on those.

624
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:35,516
Thank you. Yes,
and you're looking very lovely.

625
00:51:35,517 --> 00:51:38,760
In fact, I was talking
to D'Artagnan...

626
00:51:41,246 --> 00:51:42,684
How beautiful you are.

627
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,208
Thank you, my Lord.

628
00:53:19,662 --> 00:53:22,422
- How did it go?
- Clock work.

629
00:53:22,423 --> 00:53:24,304
Good!

630
00:53:24,305 --> 00:53:27,906
You'll go back to London with
Buckingham. And the diamonds.

631
00:53:27,907 --> 00:53:29,668
And what should I do with them?

632
00:53:29,669 --> 00:53:31,750
Put them in his personal vault.

633
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:33,912
The most
secure location in all of England.

634
00:53:33,913 --> 00:53:35,634
- The Tower of London.
- Yep.

635
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,918
When the scandal breaks, he'll deny
everything.

636
00:53:39,919 --> 00:53:42,922
But once the diamonds
are discovered in his possession...

637
00:53:42,923 --> 00:53:45,724
He would have led England to war
through his indiscretion.

638
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:50,088
and what about the future of France?

639
00:53:52,294 --> 00:53:54,212
I am France.

640
00:54:03,304 --> 00:54:04,742
One last thing.

641
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:11,550
I suppose it's quite easy,
perhaps even tempting

642
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:14,792
for a double agent to play both sides.

643
00:54:15,716 --> 00:54:19,278
Have I given your Eminense any reason to doubt
my loyalty?

644
00:54:19,279 --> 00:54:20,678
Spare me the rhetoric.

645
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:24,922
I know who you are.
I know what you are.

646
00:54:26,128 --> 00:54:29,606
You have a gift for
corruption and a penchant for betrayal.

647
00:54:29,607 --> 00:54:31,890
I admire such skills.

648
00:54:32,534 --> 00:54:34,972
But I'll destroy you
the moment I suspect

649
00:54:34,973 --> 00:54:37,536
you might be using them against me.

650
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,298
Do we understand one another?

651
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:48,106
There... is another side to that coin.

652
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:53,790
It's quiet easy for an employer to severe
all ties with his operative

653
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,154
in the event they are compromised,

654
00:54:56,155 --> 00:55:00,196
leaving them to rot in jail or on the gallows.

655
00:55:02,524 --> 00:55:03,960
Your point being?

656
00:55:05,766 --> 00:55:09,126
I require a guarantee that I shall
not suffer a similar fate.

657
00:55:11,172 --> 00:55:14,010
An insurance policy, if you will.

658
00:55:14,776 --> 00:55:16,452
My word should suffice.

659
00:55:17,738 --> 00:55:20,298
I'm afraid I need something a bit
more...

660
00:55:22,182 --> 00:55:23,780
substantial.

661
00:55:26,026 --> 00:55:29,866
It is by my order and for the good of
the State that

662
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:34,910
the bearer of this has
done what has been done.

663
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,352
Satisfied?

664
00:55:36,353 --> 00:55:37,754
Immensely.

665
00:55:44,324 --> 00:55:46,322
Your Majesty.

666
00:55:46,326 --> 00:55:47,762
Purple.

667
00:55:49,208 --> 00:55:51,368
Fashion favors the bold.

668
00:55:52,732 --> 00:55:55,772
Here.
Try this for size.

669
00:55:57,418 --> 00:56:00,696
However, do my regards
to the Queen.

670
00:56:00,697 --> 00:56:04,820
I will convey your diplomatic proposal to
King James immediately.

671
00:56:04,821 --> 00:56:08,024
Cardinal Richelieu,
a pleasure.

672
00:56:08,025 --> 00:56:09,426
All mine.

673
00:56:15,234 --> 00:56:16,992
Your Eminence.

674
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,900
Richelieu, Richelieu.

675
00:56:39,698 --> 00:56:42,036
There has been a most
distressing development!

676
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,820
Certain letters, love letters,

677
00:56:44,821 --> 00:56:46,622
were discovered
in a Queen's possession.

678
00:56:46,623 --> 00:56:50,344
Letters from him. Buckingham,
of course. Who else?

679
00:56:50,345 --> 00:56:52,548
Have you spoken to the Queen
about these letters?

680
00:56:52,549 --> 00:56:54,348
No, of course, I haven't.

681
00:56:54,349 --> 00:56:56,070
They will just deny the whole thing.

682
00:56:57,476 --> 00:56:59,714
I can see Your Majesty's dilemma.

683
00:57:00,518 --> 00:57:03,398
Is there any mention of a
specific encounter?

684
00:57:03,402 --> 00:57:04,840
A detail?

685
00:57:05,524 --> 00:57:07,040
A token of affection, perhaps?

686
00:57:07,041 --> 00:57:09,284
Yes!
Yes there is.

687
00:57:09,888 --> 00:57:11,326
A necklace.

688
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:13,968
The one I gave her for
our anniversary! Here!

689
00:57:13,969 --> 00:57:18,172
"I shall always cherish the 12 studded
diamonds you gave me."

690
00:57:18,173 --> 00:57:20,654
"The proof of our consummated love."

691
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:24,178
Does "consummated" mean
what I think it means?

692
00:57:24,822 --> 00:57:26,380
Yes, I'm afraid it does.

693
00:57:28,306 --> 00:57:29,744
Oh, my God!

694
00:57:30,748 --> 00:57:33,266
All your
Majesty has to do is throw a ball.

695
00:57:34,312 --> 00:57:36,350
What?
How would that help?

696
00:57:36,351 --> 00:57:38,512
It would give you, Majesty, a pretext to

697
00:57:38,513 --> 00:57:41,074
suggest to the Queen that she wear your gift.

698
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:46,720
Oh, Richelieu. That's very clever.

699
00:57:46,721 --> 00:57:48,682
So if she has the diamonds?

700
00:57:48,683 --> 00:57:50,602
Then your Majesty can rest easy.

701
00:57:52,128 --> 00:57:53,646
And if she doesn't?

702
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:58,372
He wants to have a celebration
ball, five days from now.

703
00:57:58,373 --> 00:58:01,154
Send my diamonds to the jewelers to be
polished.

704
00:58:01,155 --> 00:58:03,976
I want the King's...
undivided attention that evening.

705
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,758
I hope I am not interrupting.

706
00:58:25,759 --> 00:58:28,400
Hardly, your Majesty. To what do I-?

707
00:58:28,401 --> 00:58:29,802
I know.

708
00:58:30,568 --> 00:58:33,806
Perhaps your Majesty would care to be a bit more specific?

709
00:58:33,569 --> 00:58:35,208
I know.

710
00:58:36,572 --> 00:58:40,412
Yeah, I assume this is the part where I'm
supposed to laugh maniacally

711
00:58:40,413 --> 00:58:44,416
and regale your Majesty with the details
of some diabolical plot.

712
00:58:44,417 --> 00:58:47,540
However, I
regret to inform your Majesty

713
00:58:47,541 --> 00:58:50,062
that I have no idea
what you're talking about.

714
00:58:50,063 --> 00:58:51,902
I thought you would say that.

715
00:58:51,906 --> 00:58:55,788
Then, why did you grace me
with the honor of your visit?

716
00:58:55,789 --> 00:58:57,948
To look into your eyes when you
said it.

717
00:59:06,722 --> 00:59:08,160
Your Majesty.

718
00:59:11,846 --> 00:59:13,444
All may not be lost yet.

719
00:59:19,334 --> 00:59:21,772
Coming, coming! Hold your horses!

720
00:59:21,773 --> 00:59:23,654
It's not like it's a matter of life
and death, you know!

721
00:59:23,656 --> 00:59:25,858
Actually, it is.

722
00:59:25,859 --> 00:59:28,618
You want me
to go to England. Retrieve the diamonds

723
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:31,944
which the Queen suspects
might be in Buckingham's possession.

724
00:59:31,945 --> 00:59:36,346
Which will naturally involve breaking into some
heavily fortified and highly impregnable facility.

725
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:37,668
The Tower Of London.

726
00:59:37,669 --> 00:59:40,190
Since the Cardinal's spies are
trying to implicate the Duke,

727
00:59:40,191 --> 00:59:42,592
it is the most logical choice.

728
00:59:42,596 --> 00:59:46,796
Then return
to Paris, with every soldier, assassin,

729
00:59:46,797 --> 00:59:51,802
mercenary and bounty hunter on both
sides of the Channel out to stop me from doing so.

730
00:59:51,803 --> 00:59:55,366
Did I miss anything?

731
00:59:55,367 --> 00:59:56,808
All in five days

732
00:59:56,809 --> 00:59:59,208
a minor detail.
Anything else?

733
00:59:59,209 --> 01:00:01,212
No.

734
01:00:01,213 --> 01:00:03,494
Well, I really have only one question for you.

735
01:00:04,178 --> 01:00:06,456
Why in the world would I do that?

736
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,706
England it is.

737
01:00:19,112 --> 01:00:21,472
Diamonds, Buckingham
Tower of London, 5 days,

738
01:00:21,473 --> 01:00:24,397
the Queen's reputation and the fate
of France as we know it.

739
01:00:24,398 --> 01:00:25,879
Who's with me?

740
01:00:30,641 --> 01:00:33,887
I should imagine the Queen
would be quite generous.

741
01:00:33,888 --> 01:00:35,207
Count Porthos.

742
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:38,611
Hm? What is it? That has a certain ring to it, doesn't it?

743
01:00:38,612 --> 01:00:43,295
Besides, I hear the English women are lot like
a frozen ball of champagne.

744
01:00:43,296 --> 01:00:46,739
Ice on the outside.
But once you warm them up...

745
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:51,303
This isn't a great cause. But, it'll
have to do.

746
01:00:56,347 --> 01:00:58,591
Buckingham's there, so is she.

747
01:00:58,592 --> 01:01:00,071
Who?

748
01:01:00,072 --> 01:01:05,197
Countess de Winter. Charlotte Backson.
Anne de Breuil.

749
01:01:05,198 --> 01:01:07,000
Lady Clarick.

750
01:01:07,001 --> 01:01:09,280
Milady.

751
01:01:09,281 --> 01:01:10,163
Milady.

752
01:01:11,361 --> 01:01:12,982
I know her.
I saw her with Rochefort.

753
01:01:13,843 --> 01:01:15,767
She switched sides again.

754
01:01:15,768 --> 01:01:17,689
Working for the Cardinal, no doubt.

755
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:19,451
What are you gonna do if you catch her?

756
01:01:20,452 --> 01:01:24,673
(Musketeers, Open up!
And surrender by order of the Cardinal!)

757
01:01:24,674 --> 01:01:26,457
- You were followed.
- It's Rochefort.

758
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:31,501
Athos, Porthos, Aramis
and D'Artagnan.

759
01:01:31,502 --> 01:01:34,465
Surrender your weapons and no harm will come to you.

760
01:01:37,185 --> 01:01:40,671
The moment they step out,
kill them!

761
01:01:42,831 --> 01:01:44,435
Light the torches!

762
01:01:44,436 --> 01:01:47,639
I'll count to 5 and then we will burn you out.

763
01:01:53,035 --> 01:01:54,000
1!

764
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,301
2!

765
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,502
3!

766
01:01:56,725 --> 01:02:01,011
- Oh, sorry, didn't see you there.
- Damn you!
- Haha!

767
01:02:20,627 --> 01:02:24,635
Let me guess. You've come to tell
me that the Musketeers are dead?

768
01:02:24,636 --> 01:02:26,997
our
plan is proceeding on schedule,

769
01:02:26,998 --> 01:02:30,801
and I have absolutely positively
nothing to worry about.

770
01:02:30,802 --> 01:02:33,803
We were taken by surprise
Your Eminence.

771
01:02:33,804 --> 01:02:36,600
Somehow I was laboring under the
assumption that

772
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:39,849
the plan was for you
to take them by surprise.

773
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:41,411
Was it not?

774
01:02:41,412 --> 01:02:44,653
Your Eminence...
- Yes, you are quite fond of that word, aren't you?

775
01:02:44,654 --> 01:02:48,137
Sadly repeating it does not
get you into my good graces.

776
01:02:48,138 --> 01:02:50,939
Alert Milady.
Watch the ports.

777
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,743
No one is to leave for England
without my official permission.

778
01:02:53,744 --> 01:02:56,065
Post a bounty on their
heads.

779
01:02:56,066 --> 01:02:57,385
The bigger, the better.

780
01:02:57,386 --> 01:02:59,909
Yes, Your Eminence.

781
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:01,351
Rochefort...

782
01:03:03,629 --> 01:03:06,035
Do not fail me again.

783
01:03:10,957 --> 01:03:13,523
PORT OF CALAIS.

784
01:03:16,723 --> 01:03:20,409
Jussac, and a lot of help,
has no way to get past them.

785
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:22,771
How the hell that they get
there so fast?

786
01:03:25,773 --> 01:03:28,114
Now, what?
- We need a distraction.

787
01:03:28,975 --> 01:03:30,499
- I'll go.
- I'll go.

788
01:03:30,457 --> 01:03:31,950
I could go.

789
01:03:31,951 --> 01:03:33,501
Probably not.

790
01:03:33,502 --> 01:03:35,623
Wrong.
Wrong on all counts.

791
01:03:35,624 --> 01:03:37,907
You'll need every sword
where you're going.

792
01:03:37,908 --> 01:03:40,549
I can't help you there
but I can help.

793
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:41,989
Right here. Right now.

794
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:43,833
- If they catch you.
- They won't!

795
01:03:43,834 --> 01:03:46,593
- If they catch you!
- I'm the Queen's lady in waiting.

796
01:03:46,594 --> 01:03:48,877
You, on the other hand, are
wanted fugitive,

797
01:03:48,878 --> 01:03:51,639
and about to steal from
the most powerful man in England.

798
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:54,241
Which one of us should be worried?

799
01:03:54,242 --> 01:03:58,085
Go! Go so that you can come back.

800
01:04:09,735 --> 01:04:11,259
Now give me that hat!

801
01:04:18,463 --> 01:04:19,867
D'Artagnan!

802
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:21,269
Behind him!

803
01:04:37,723 --> 01:04:38,184
Wait!

804
01:04:41,205 --> 01:04:44,611
The diamonds will be in Buckingham's
personal vault.

805
01:04:44,612 --> 01:04:48,495
It's located on the lowest, most secure
level of the Tower, next to the Crown Jewels.

806
01:04:48,496 --> 01:04:50,617
The lock is state of the art.

807
01:04:50,618 --> 01:04:53,459
Requires a key that Buckingham carries
on his person at all times.

808
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,800
The corridor leading up to its booby traps

809
01:04:55,059 --> 01:04:59,065
That's straightforward.
Does anyone want some bread and cheese? If you...

810
01:04:59,066 --> 01:05:01,667
You haven't finished the brief, aren't you?

811
01:05:01,668 --> 01:05:03,751
I'm so sorry.
Please don't tell me.

812
01:05:03,752 --> 01:05:06,990
When it gets worse. A
lot worse.

813
01:05:06,991 --> 01:05:10,197
We have to cross 3 stoned walls
to the moat.

814
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:12,197
Then it's just a couple of hundred
highly trained soldiers

815
01:05:12,198 --> 01:05:14,039
with a predilection for not being robbed

816
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,563
although since Buckingham undoubtedly
knows we are coming,

817
01:05:16,564 --> 01:05:19,165
thanks to Milady,
that number is likely to be greater

818
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:22,209
And why can't we just tell Buckingham
Milady is plotting against him?

819
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:23,649
Because he won't believe us.

820
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:26,291
Why should he? We're his sworn enemies.

821
01:05:26,292 --> 01:05:30,375
Besides, Milady would have made sure.

822
01:05:30,376 --> 01:05:32,619
Athos is coming.

823
01:05:34,219 --> 01:05:38,463
Tell me what do you suppose
his after?

824
01:05:38,464 --> 01:05:40,707
What does it matter?

825
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:45,311
Whatever it is,
it's merely an excuse.

826
01:05:45,312 --> 01:05:47,233
He wants revenge for
Venice.

827
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:52,117
He wants me. And he wants you.

828
01:05:55,317 --> 01:05:57,363
We shall have to be ready for him.

829
01:05:57,364 --> 01:06:00,245
Want me?

830
01:06:00,246 --> 01:06:04,409
We can't outshoot them. But we can
outsmart them.

831
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:07,933
He'll naturally favor misdirection and
deception.

832
01:06:07,934 --> 01:06:11,276
He knows we're expecting
him. But that just ups the ante.

833
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:15,259
She knows us,
know how we look like.

834
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:16,741
How we move and how we think.

835
01:06:16,742 --> 01:06:19,223
He'll divide his forces. Independent
teams,

836
01:06:19,224 --> 01:06:23,027
each with their own point of
entry to maximize their chances.

837
01:06:23,028 --> 01:06:27,631
- There are four of us, so we use...
- There are 5 of us, actually. If you...

838
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:34,519
He's a skilled diver. He'll take the
aquatic route to the trader's gate.

839
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:41,485
Aramis will undoubtedly rely on
agility and stealth.

840
01:06:41,486 --> 01:06:44,809
Check every tower,
every rooftop.

841
01:06:47,249 --> 01:06:51,815
Porthos, on the other hand, will
employ brute strength.

842
01:06:51,816 --> 01:06:55,939
One of his preferred method is getting
captured by the opposition.

843
01:07:00,023 --> 01:07:03,000
All the more
reason to take none of them alive.

844
01:07:05,027 --> 01:07:06,751
One more thing.

845
01:07:10,711 --> 01:07:12,917
He may try and
drive a wedge between us.

846
01:07:12,918 --> 01:07:15,679
Claim to have secret information

847
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,321
about some
plot to get us to turn against one another.

848
01:07:18,322 --> 01:07:21,925
Like, say, that I'm a double
agent working for the Cardinal.

849
01:07:21,926 --> 01:07:25,889
Or that you are looking to get rid of me.

850
01:07:28,089 --> 01:07:34,017
I assure you, nothing could be
further from the truth.

851
01:07:36,259 --> 01:07:37,661
Although

852
01:07:39,019 --> 01:07:42,987
I suppose I should

853
01:07:42,988 --> 01:07:47,309
search you for concealed weapons.

854
01:07:49,911 --> 01:07:51,473
That's how it's done.

855
01:07:53,033 --> 01:07:55,799
And that's exactly what she'll expect.

856
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,681
So we do the unexpected.

857
01:07:59,682 --> 01:08:03,805
We go in Broad daylight.
One man, hiding in plain sight.

858
01:08:03,806 --> 01:08:07,129
With all the extra security, there'll be a
lot of new faces. That's their weakness.

859
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:10,933
And you D'Artagnan. You're the wild card.

860
01:08:10,934 --> 01:08:14,017
We are the decoys.

861
01:08:14,018 --> 01:08:16,657
Now, we'll try and create a distraction,

862
01:08:16,658 --> 01:08:19,983
keep them occupied, keep them away
from you as much as possible.

863
01:08:19,984 --> 01:08:23,545
But ultimately,
it's up to you.

864
01:08:23,546 --> 01:08:25,507
You wanted to be a Musketeer.

865
01:08:25,508 --> 01:08:29,631
You wanted to serve France. This is
your chance.

866
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:42,123
I saw your signal.

867
01:08:42,124 --> 01:08:43,725
I saw you waving like an idiot.

868
01:08:43,726 --> 01:08:45,207
Well, that was not the bloody signal.

869
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:47,287
I'm trying to see things
from your point of view,

870
01:08:47,288 --> 01:08:49,771
but unfortunately, I can't
get my head that far up my ass.

871
01:08:49,772 --> 01:08:51,173
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

872
01:08:51,174 --> 01:08:52,973
All right, that's enough of that!

873
01:08:57,817 --> 01:09:00,461
- Sergeant, I want you to arrest this man!
- Arrest me?

874
01:09:30,649 --> 01:09:34,095
Sir, the first
of the Musketeers has been arrested.

875
01:09:35,013 --> 01:09:36,577
The game is afoot.

876
01:09:36,578 --> 01:09:40,021
Bring him to me
and double the guards.

877
01:09:40,022 --> 01:09:43,903
Double the troops.
Double everything.

878
01:09:43,904 --> 01:09:45,265
Sir!

879
01:09:45,266 --> 01:09:48,267
They'll come to us.

880
01:09:50,107 --> 01:09:54,433
Well then, I think your Lordship
has everything under control.

881
01:09:55,113 --> 01:09:58,519
You won't mind if I don't stay to
see how it all turns out?

882
01:09:59,637 --> 01:10:02,361
- Do you think I might lose?
- On the contrary!

883
01:10:02,362 --> 01:10:05,285
I have no issues
with you killing Athos but

884
01:10:05,286 --> 01:10:08,207
if it's all the same to you,
I'd rather not watch him die.

885
01:10:11,289 --> 01:10:12,731
Tell me.

886
01:10:12,732 --> 01:10:13,512
What's your favorite color?

887
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,181
Red.

888
01:10:22,941 --> 01:10:24,383
Why?

889
01:10:24,384 --> 01:10:26,524
I wanted to see if you're capable
of telling the truth.

890
01:10:39,797 --> 01:10:41,881
As far from here as possible.

891
01:10:55,571 --> 01:10:57,015
Well, well, well...

892
01:10:59,697 --> 01:11:02,941
Look what the cat
dragged in.

893
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:06,865
So. How's the old Athos, eh?

894
01:11:08,263 --> 01:11:11,711
Still his surly, insufferable self, I'm sure.

895
01:11:11,712 --> 01:11:16,233
Sending a boy to do a man's job.

896
01:11:16,234 --> 01:11:18,157
I should feel insulted.

897
01:11:21,117 --> 01:11:23,201
What were you after anyway?

898
01:11:25,161 --> 01:11:28,967
Secrets. Spies.
It's all a game really.

899
01:11:28,968 --> 01:11:33,891
Although the price of loss, as you'll come to
discover, is a bit higher.

900
01:11:36,733 --> 01:11:38,175
What?

901
01:11:39,133 --> 01:11:40,899
No last words? No need?

902
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:44,901
Insults? please
for mercy or...

903
01:11:44,902 --> 01:11:46,303
What time is it?

904
01:11:48,263 --> 01:11:50,107
About 2 o'clock.

905
01:11:50,108 --> 01:11:53,191
I have to say, why? Are you in a hurry?

906
01:11:55,951 --> 01:11:57,552
Look out of the window.

907
01:12:05,078 --> 01:12:08,244
They weren't the decoys. I was.

908
01:13:12,824 --> 01:13:15,470
- Permission to come aboard.
- Granted.

909
01:13:33,366 --> 01:13:35,648
Athos!

910
01:13:52,184 --> 01:13:56,710
The wonderful thing about fighting an
imaginary opponent, Captain Rochefort,

911
01:13:57,390 --> 01:14:01,074
is that he's always greatly skilled
yet easily defeated.

912
01:14:01,075 --> 01:14:03,036
Your Eminence.

913
01:14:03,037 --> 01:14:05,958
The pride of
victory without the risk of loss.

914
01:14:07,278 --> 01:14:10,324
I trust you didn't come here to
impress me with your swordsmanship.

915
01:14:10,325 --> 01:14:11,724
No, Your Eminence.

916
01:14:12,522 --> 01:14:14,328
I have some good news.

917
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:15,728
Such as...?

918
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:32,786
So, what about the diamonds?

919
01:14:32,787 --> 01:14:36,108
- Doesn't Buckingham still have them?
- No.

920
01:14:36,109 --> 01:14:37,870
Milady likes hedging her bets.

921
01:14:37,871 --> 01:14:40,714
She'd never take the chance that we would
succeed in breaking into the vault.

922
01:14:42,032 --> 01:14:44,196
So where are they now?

923
01:14:44,197 --> 01:14:46,720
With the only person
she trusts.

924
01:14:52,322 --> 01:14:54,766
Which means we've lost.
And all this has been for nothing.

925
01:14:54,767 --> 01:14:56,168
Ohh, I wouldn't say that.

926
01:15:02,972 --> 01:15:06,898
You were the decoy. We were the
extraction. But the real linchpin of the plan.

927
01:15:07,496 --> 01:15:08,940
Well..

928
01:15:08,941 --> 01:15:11,224
That was
someone else entirely.

929
01:15:14,344 --> 01:15:16,588
Someone even
Milady would never suspect.

930
01:15:21,872 --> 01:15:24,196
Driver, what the hell
is going on?

931
01:15:24,197 --> 01:15:25,796
Just following your instructions,
Ma'am.

932
01:15:25,797 --> 01:15:27,838
As far away from here as
possible.

933
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,444
Planchet, I never thought
I would say this, but

934
01:16:15,402 --> 01:16:17,006
Welldone!

935
01:16:17,007 --> 01:16:18,408
Thank you, sir.

936
01:16:19,088 --> 01:16:22,092
- That really means a lot, especially coming from you.
- Shut up, Planchet.

937
01:16:22,093 --> 01:16:23,494
Yes, sir.

938
01:16:30,418 --> 01:16:31,862
Don't!

939
01:16:34,942 --> 01:16:37,228
We took the precaution of removing
the gun powder.

940
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:46,836
- What now?
- You give me the diamonds.

941
01:16:46,837 --> 01:16:48,958
Or I take
them off your corpse.

942
01:16:48,959 --> 01:16:50,400
Dealer's choice.

943
01:16:53,804 --> 01:16:55,726
Anything else you like me to take off?

944
01:16:55,727 --> 01:16:57,126
Outside.

945
01:17:09,456 --> 01:17:12,422
Boys. Been a while.

946
01:17:16,062 --> 01:17:18,146
This must
be the young Gascon.

947
01:17:19,186 --> 01:17:20,630
We've met before.

948
01:17:22,268 --> 01:17:25,194
Ah, yes. Small world.

949
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,872
I didn't let Rochefort kill you.

950
01:17:31,364 --> 01:17:33,316
You do remember that, don't you?

951
01:17:40,812 --> 01:17:42,364
Did you kill Buckingham?

952
01:17:42,365 --> 01:17:44,366
No.

953
01:17:44,367 --> 01:17:46,488
- But you will kill me.
- Yes

954
01:17:49,742 --> 01:17:51,654
You'd spare him, but kill me.

955
01:17:51,655 --> 01:17:54,416
Yes. I don't hate Buckingham.

956
01:18:03,156 --> 01:18:06,948
Here. You might find a use for this.

957
01:18:10,082 --> 01:18:11,512
Move.

958
01:18:45,276 --> 01:18:46,708
Athos.

959
01:19:04,896 --> 01:19:07,608
At least she
died the way she lived.

960
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:09,370
On her own terms.

961
01:19:12,382 --> 01:19:13,934
No. She did it for me.

962
01:19:15,986 --> 01:19:18,818
I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I
pulled the trigger.

963
01:19:22,794 --> 01:19:24,224
C'mon. Let's go home.

964
01:19:57,346 --> 01:19:59,338
Your Majesty!

965
01:19:59,348 --> 01:20:02,662
My dear.
You look troubled.

966
01:20:02,663 --> 01:20:04,144
Hardly.

967
01:20:04,145 --> 01:20:06,066
Your Majesty just startled me.

968
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:07,746
Oh, I'm so sorry.

969
01:20:08,676 --> 01:20:11,030
I just...
wanted to drop by

970
01:20:11,031 --> 01:20:13,712
and tell you how much I am looking forward
to tonight.

971
01:20:13,713 --> 01:20:16,074
It should be quite spectacular, you
know.

972
01:20:16,075 --> 01:20:18,078
Costumes, fireworks, and such.

973
01:20:19,088 --> 01:20:20,558
But you...

974
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:25,044
you shall be the most
spectacular sight of all.

975
01:20:25,045 --> 01:20:27,846
And especially since you'll wear the
diamonds.

976
01:20:28,978 --> 01:20:30,650
You will wear them, won't you?

977
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,854
Well, it's very important
for me that you do.

978
01:20:36,746 --> 01:20:38,896
Then I shall wear them, your Majesty.

979
01:20:40,348 --> 01:20:41,820
Until tonight then.

980
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,552
She promised she'll wear them.

981
01:20:55,084 --> 01:20:57,996
You do think she'll wear them? Don't
you, Richelieu?

982
01:20:57,997 --> 01:21:00,358
I'm sure she will, your Majesty.

983
01:21:00,359 --> 01:21:01,840
I'm sure she will.

984
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:32,190
I- I'm in trouble.

985
01:21:47,174 --> 01:21:48,646
Damn!

986
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,652
Now that we got their attention...

987
01:22:36,653 --> 01:22:39,176
Now let's see if we can settle this
in a peaceful manner.

988
01:22:39,177 --> 01:22:40,496
More or less.

989
01:22:42,828 --> 01:22:44,460
Gascon!

990
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:47,862
So you've traded up when it comes
to transport

991
01:22:47,863 --> 01:22:50,306
once again,
you're outmatched.

992
01:22:50,316 --> 01:22:52,308
You can thank
Milady for that.

993
01:22:52,309 --> 01:22:55,030
She passed on Buckingham's
plans a long time ago.

994
01:22:55,031 --> 01:22:57,554
As you can see,
we've made some improvements.

995
01:22:59,804 --> 01:23:01,236
Isn't she a beauty?

996
01:23:01,246 --> 01:23:02,558
What do you want?

997
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:06,440
The diamonds?

998
01:23:06,441 --> 01:23:07,762
Come and take them.

999
01:23:07,763 --> 01:23:09,044
Gladly.

1000
01:23:09,045 --> 01:23:12,246
You see, I can blast you out
of the sky with total impunity.

1001
01:23:12,247 --> 01:23:14,690
If you fire on me, on the other hand,

1002
01:23:14,691 --> 01:23:16,492
you'd be killing Ms. Oh So Young and Pretty.

1003
01:23:19,024 --> 01:23:20,736
You have 60 seconds.

1004
01:23:22,668 --> 01:23:25,058
He'll shoot us down the moment he
has the diamonds.

1005
01:23:25,059 --> 01:23:26,380
We can't outrun them.

1006
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:28,062
We can fight, damn it! We can...

1007
01:23:28,063 --> 01:23:29,464
- Uh, D'Artagnan...
- What?

1008
01:23:30,154 --> 01:23:32,666
Do you think you have
the monopoly on loss?!

1009
01:23:32,667 --> 01:23:34,670
What if she dies?

1010
01:23:34,671 --> 01:23:36,870
The life of one
woman or the future of France!

1011
01:23:36,871 --> 01:23:38,352
What would you do if you were in
my position?!

1012
01:23:40,646 --> 01:23:43,196
I've made a lot of sacrifices. Made a
lot of hard choices.

1013
01:23:43,197 --> 01:23:46,320
For honor, for King, for country. Do you
know what I 've learned, boy?

1014
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:49,724
Hard choices and sacrifices do not keep
you warm at night.

1015
01:23:49,725 --> 01:23:52,206
And life is too damn short and
too damn long

1016
01:23:52,207 --> 01:23:53,968
to go through without
someone at your side.

1017
01:23:53,969 --> 01:23:55,688
Don't end up
like me.

1018
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:57,972
Choose the woman.

1019
01:23:57,973 --> 01:23:59,734
Fight for love, D'Artagnan.

1020
01:24:00,704 --> 01:24:02,656
France will take care
of itself.

1021
01:24:03,948 --> 01:24:05,300
Time's up!

1022
01:24:09,112 --> 01:24:10,784
An exchange.

1023
01:24:11,876 --> 01:24:13,746
I go aboard your
ship with the diamonds.

1024
01:24:13,747 --> 01:24:15,068
The girl goes aboard ours.

1025
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:17,952
Once I know she's
safe,

1026
01:24:17,953 --> 01:24:19,232
I give them to you.

1027
01:24:20,202 --> 01:24:21,594
Fine.

1028
01:24:21,595 --> 01:24:23,478
But I want to see the
diamonds first.

1029
01:24:24,288 --> 01:24:25,638
Planchet.

1030
01:24:28,172 --> 01:24:29,482
Cut her loose.

1031
01:24:32,054 --> 01:24:35,328
- Aboard the gangway!
- Aboard the gangway!

1032
01:24:44,186 --> 01:24:45,898
Satisfied?

1033
01:25:31,314 --> 01:25:32,904
You never learn, do you?

1034
01:25:40,682 --> 01:25:42,034
Fire!

1035
01:25:46,928 --> 01:25:48,240
Hard right!

1036
01:25:48,241 --> 01:25:49,802
Fire!

1037
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:20,900
Good!

1038
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,874
I really want you to see this.

1039
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:25,236
Finish them off!

1040
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,118
We can't outrun
them. We can't outgun them.

1041
01:26:29,119 --> 01:26:32,162
We can try asking them to surrender,
but somehow I don't think it'll work.

1042
01:26:32,163 --> 01:26:34,324
We hide. In there.

1043
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,000
Fire!

1044
01:27:02,282 --> 01:27:04,194
Follow them!

1045
01:27:12,852 --> 01:27:14,804
He's persistent, I'll give him that.

1046
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:22,652
But sir?

1047
01:27:22,653 --> 01:27:24,252
We can't go
into the storm!

1048
01:27:29,108 --> 01:27:32,582
Anyone? Anyone else
who wants to question orders?

1049
01:27:35,354 --> 01:27:36,704
Good.

1050
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:53,482
Sir!

1051
01:27:53,483 --> 01:27:55,844
Now, might be a good time to talk about the possibility

1052
01:27:55,845 --> 01:27:57,686
- of a raise?
- Shut up, Planchet!

1053
01:27:57,687 --> 01:27:58,968
Yes, sir.

1054
01:28:16,836 --> 01:28:18,186
Where are they?

1055
01:28:20,118 --> 01:28:22,470
You'll never gonna find them in there.

1056
01:28:23,162 --> 01:28:24,592
Oh, I beg to differ.

1057
01:28:40,498 --> 01:28:41,850
Keep after them!

1058
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:44,452
I'll take the Gascon!

1059
01:29:15,612 --> 01:29:17,724
You know what your problem is, boy?

1060
01:29:17,725 --> 01:29:19,286
You've read too many books.

1061
01:29:19,287 --> 01:29:21,808
And then
you believed them.

1062
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:25,012
Courage. Honor.

1063
01:29:25,942 --> 01:29:27,414
All for one.

1064
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:30,176
But history isn't written by
heroes.

1065
01:29:30,177 --> 01:29:31,818
It's written by victors.

1066
01:29:31,819 --> 01:29:33,338
Keep your eyes open.

1067
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,830
Round two.

1068
01:29:44,831 --> 01:29:46,392
Ohh ss...

1069
01:30:08,024 --> 01:30:10,776
- Set sail!
- We're too heavy!

1070
01:30:12,548 --> 01:30:14,780
Are you scared to take me in a fair fight?

1071
01:30:15,950 --> 01:30:17,662
Hardly.

1072
01:30:17,663 --> 01:30:19,986
I just don't fight fair.

1073
01:30:21,836 --> 01:30:23,748
Captain Rochefort!

1074
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,900
Captain Rochefort!

1075
01:30:27,562 --> 01:30:29,154
Well, well.

1076
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:47,652
Drop the barrells!

1077
01:30:47,653 --> 01:30:49,934
Drop everything!

1078
01:30:49,935 --> 01:30:51,896
And fire up the burners!

1079
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:58,022
Faster!
Move!

1080
01:31:09,284 --> 01:31:10,794
Shall we?

1081
01:31:20,774 --> 01:31:22,446
Hold on!

1082
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:27,892
Get out of the way!

1083
01:32:41,494 --> 01:32:44,726
I still have the diamonds.

1084
01:32:44,727 --> 01:32:46,970
What do
you propose to do about that?

1085
01:32:46,971 --> 01:32:48,530
Kill you.

1086
01:32:56,468 --> 01:32:58,260
If you insist.

1087
01:33:07,678 --> 01:33:09,110
Close.

1088
01:35:29,858 --> 01:35:32,170
You should have stayed in Gascon, boy.

1089
01:35:40,428 --> 01:35:43,180
You should have apologized to my horse.

1090
01:36:17,344 --> 01:36:20,578
Surround the palace! Shoot the
Musketeers on sight!

1091
01:36:20,579 --> 01:36:24,782
Use every man at
your disposal! Any means necessary!

1092
01:36:24,783 --> 01:36:26,544
- Your Eminence...
- Don't interrupt!

1093
01:36:26,545 --> 01:36:28,506
These men must not...

1094
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:55,290
Arrest these men!

1095
01:37:02,708 --> 01:37:04,260
What is the meaning of this?

1096
01:37:06,112 --> 01:37:08,544
- Your Majesty...
- These men...

1097
01:37:08,545 --> 01:37:10,066
Are delivering a gift for your
Majesty.

1098
01:37:10,067 --> 01:37:11,588
Compliments of the Cardinal.

1099
01:37:13,235 --> 01:37:16,155
Cardinal! You shouldn't have!

1100
01:37:17,801 --> 01:37:21,239
Well, your Majesty did ask me to
get you one of those.

1101
01:37:21,239 --> 01:37:22,601
So I did!

1102
01:37:26,489 --> 01:37:28,007
But what happened to it?

1103
01:37:28,008 --> 01:37:31,209
Buckingham's spy, Captain Rochefort,
attempted to sabotage the craft.

1104
01:37:31,213 --> 01:37:33,451
- He's been dealt with.
- Rochefort?

1105
01:37:33,452 --> 01:37:35,335
His the Captain of your Guards, isn't he?

1106
01:37:35,336 --> 01:37:39,859
Actually His Eminence was the one
who uncovered the traitor.

1107
01:37:44,345 --> 01:37:46,865
"It is by my order and for the good of
the State

1108
01:37:46,866 --> 01:37:51,589
that the bearer of this has
done what has been done."

1109
01:37:53,275 --> 01:37:55,233
That's your
signature, isn't it, Richelieu?

1110
01:37:55,234 --> 01:37:57,435
It would appear so, your Majesty.

1111
01:37:57,436 --> 01:38:00,519
Well, let me get this right. You brought me an airship

1112
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:03,481
and exposed a snake in our midst!

1113
01:38:03,482 --> 01:38:05,803
How could I ever repay you?

1114
01:38:05,804 --> 01:38:08,605
I could think of a few ways.

1115
01:38:09,171 --> 01:38:10,689
Anne.

1116
01:38:12,175 --> 01:38:14,771
I was just returning from the jewelers.

1117
01:38:17,659 --> 01:38:19,377
When I realized it's
a little early.

1118
01:38:19,378 --> 01:38:22,339
but the orchestra is here,
and so are we.

1119
01:38:23,585 --> 01:38:25,983
Would your Majesty care to dance?

1120
01:38:25,984 --> 01:38:28,345
I would love to.

1121
01:38:30,111 --> 01:38:33,349
Well, mind out you fellas...

1122
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:34,751
D'Artagnan...

1123
01:38:35,637 --> 01:38:36,955
Well, well, well.

1124
01:38:38,319 --> 01:38:40,877
Looks like you aren't
the only one who gets the girl.

1125
01:38:40,878 --> 01:38:43,161
Your Majesty is a natural.

1126
01:38:44,005 --> 01:38:46,043
Guess I am.

1127
01:38:47,127 --> 01:38:48,805
As a matter of fact,

1128
01:38:48,806 --> 01:38:52,129
I think you'll start noticing a few
more changes around here.

1129
01:38:53,775 --> 01:38:55,493
Thank you.

1130
01:38:56,657 --> 01:38:58,215
For everything.

1131
01:38:58,216 --> 01:38:59,897
Any time.

1132
01:39:01,303 --> 01:39:03,899
- Well, strike out, then.
- Your Majesty!

1133
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:05,823
Positions please
gentlemen!

1134
01:39:11,671 --> 01:39:13,309
Well played.

1135
01:39:22,763 --> 01:39:24,801
I could use men like you.

1136
01:39:29,649 --> 01:39:31,767
- I already have a job.
- I'm a drunk.

1137
01:39:31,768 --> 01:39:33,449
I'm... independently wealthy.

1138
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:34,971
Thanks, but no.

1139
01:39:37,097 --> 01:39:39,575
The day will come when you wish you had said "yes".

1140
01:39:39,576 --> 01:39:42,217
Maybe, but not today.

1141
01:39:42,218 --> 01:39:44,181
Maybe, not today.

1142
01:39:55,315 --> 01:39:56,793
Enjoying the show?

1143
01:39:56,794 --> 01:39:58,633
Are you always this cocky?

1144
01:39:58,634 --> 01:40:01,117
Only on Tuesdays. And when
beautiful women

1145
01:40:01,118 --> 01:40:02,679
are involved.

1146
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:04,559
So...
You think I'm beautiful?

1147
01:40:05,885 --> 01:40:07,643
Actually, it's Tuesday.

1148
01:40:34,593 --> 01:40:36,551
So...
what now?

1149
01:40:36,552 --> 01:40:37,913
We drink.

1150
01:40:37,914 --> 01:40:39,233
Then what?

1151
01:40:39,234 --> 01:40:42,637
Wherever they send us. Whatever
France needs.

1152
01:40:42,638 --> 01:40:45,359
I thought you don't believe in that
stuff anymore.

1153
01:40:46,205 --> 01:40:47,801
I believe in us.

1154
01:40:48,525 --> 01:40:51,405
And until the day I stop believing that,
there are still

1155
01:40:51,406 --> 01:40:53,127
things in this
world worth fighting and dying for.

1156
01:40:55,406 --> 01:40:58,127
www.upwned.com

1157
01:40:59,417 --> 01:41:02,295
All for one,
and one for all!

1158
01:41:04,063 --> 01:41:08,141
You know, sirs. I know you can be a
mean, tough,

1159
01:41:08,142 --> 01:41:13,907
foul tempered bastard.
But sometimes,

1160
01:41:13,908 --> 01:41:15,709
I get the
feeling that deep down you're all...

1161
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:17,831
Shut up,
Planchet!

1162
01:41:17,832 --> 01:41:19,953
Yeah, yeah, of course...

1163
01:41:33,211 --> 01:41:35,249
In case you are wondering,

1164
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:37,489
this isn't the afterlife.

1165
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:41,215
I'm not dead.
And neither you.

1166
01:41:49,987 --> 01:41:51,303
How... did you?

1167
01:41:51,304 --> 01:41:55,707
Followed Athos. We fished you out
of the Channel.

1168
01:42:00,597 --> 01:42:03,755
- Where... are we going?
- To France, of course!

1169
01:42:07,203 --> 01:42:11,965
To get back what's mine.
And pay back with interest.
