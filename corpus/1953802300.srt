1
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,818
Can you tell me a story, Frank?

2
00:00:40,088 --> 00:00:42,056
Tell me something good.

3
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:45,093
Make me the hero, or...

4
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:46,995
maybe I can get the girl.

5
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:54,336
I got one.

6
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,490
A long time ago...

7
00:01:13,492 --> 00:01:16,893
you and me were fighter
pilots in the war.

8
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:20,364
"The Flannigan brothers. "

9
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:23,868
We were famous.

10
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:28,206
One morning, we were heading
over to Germany

11
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,841
when we got ambushed.

12
00:01:29,843 --> 00:01:33,378
You and me versus 20 German
fighters.

13
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,846
It was a mess.

14
00:01:34,848 --> 00:01:36,348
A real dogfight.

15
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,384
It was touch and go
but we were winning,

16
00:01:38,386 --> 00:01:40,219
until a Nazi
came out of the fog,

17
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:42,221
and started firing away at
you.

18
00:01:43,523 --> 00:01:47,192
Luckily, I came down and
blew the son-of-a-bitch up.

19
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:50,430
"Thanks Tiger-Five"
you said over the radio.

20
00:01:50,432 --> 00:01:52,365
Problem was
your plane was hit

21
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:53,933
and your controls were stuck.

22
00:01:53,935 --> 00:01:55,435
You were heading
towards Iceland.

23
00:01:55,437 --> 00:01:58,204
There was nothing
you could do.

24
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:00,340
You disappeared
into the clouds.

25
00:02:30,307 --> 00:02:31,541
Frank...

26
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:37,180
Frank.

27
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:39,715
Frank.

28
00:02:40,384 --> 00:02:41,718
What?

29
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:44,688
Where are your clothes?

30
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,291
Somethin' happened.

31
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:48,325
What?

32
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,066
I don't even wanna tell you,
Frank.

33
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:56,801
I don't understand
why this is happening...

34
00:02:56,803 --> 00:02:58,303
What happened?

35
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,341
Jesus Christ.

36
00:03:03,343 --> 00:03:04,476
What the fuck?

37
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:06,411
We gotta go.

38
00:03:07,947 --> 00:03:09,815
I can't drive.

39
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,531
I fell deep this time.

40
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:58,367
Didn't I, Frank?

41
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:00,636
I don't know.

42
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:03,306
I don't know what happened.

43
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:11,581
Polly Flynn got mad at me.

44
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,550
She was yellin' at me
really hard.

45
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:15,419
So I went to go get dressed.

46
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,087
She starts pointin' a gun at me.

47
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:19,690
She starts wavin' it around,
point in' it at me,

48
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,492
so I grabbed it from her.

49
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:23,561
Then she takes my pants.

50
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,195
She goes outside,

51
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:26,830
and she lights 'em on fire
with lighter fluid.

52
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:28,400
She's crazy, Frank.

53
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:30,235
She's fucking nuts.

54
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,575
I got in the car.
I was driven' home.

55
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:39,578
Just driven' down Fifth Street,
like always.

56
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,447
And then...

57
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,381
a kid...

58
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,583
a kid comes out of nowhere,
on a bike

59
00:04:43,585 --> 00:04:45,551
in the middle of the road.

60
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:48,521
I hit him.

61
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,461
So, I can't leave the kid there,
the poor kid.

62
00:04:54,463 --> 00:04:55,562
I gotta put him
in the back seat

63
00:04:55,564 --> 00:04:57,598
and take him to the hospital,
right?

64
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:00,434
then when I went
to pick him up...

65
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:07,442
he was dead, Frank.

66
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,310
I mean...

67
00:05:10,446 --> 00:05:13,147
It was the most horrible thing
I ever fuckin' seen.

68
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:18,086
I drove a block
from Saint Mary's

69
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:19,754
I dropped him
in the frozen grass

70
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:21,490
in front of the office
building...

71
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,461
And then I came to see you,
Frank.

72
00:05:44,982 --> 00:05:47,418
I don't think we should
go back to Reno.

73
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:50,988
Now...

74
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,458
There's an old wooden box
in my closet,

75
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,060
behind my sweaters.

76
00:05:56,928 --> 00:06:01,433
Inside the box is 500 dollars
and my will.

77
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:03,468
The will gives you instructions

78
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,504
on what to do with my body,

79
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:06,838
how and where
to pay the rent,

80
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,640
title to the car,

81
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:10,008
that sorta thing.

82
00:06:12,512 --> 00:06:16,449
Also, there's your dad's
fancy gun.

83
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:18,685
Don't let anybody fool you.

84
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:20,553
That gun's worth money.

85
00:06:24,058 --> 00:06:26,627
Now, if I can hang on...

86
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:31,031
you'll soon both be old
enough to live on our own.

87
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:35,169
But...

88
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:37,438
if I do die...

89
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:40,975
they may try to split you up.

90
00:06:45,682 --> 00:06:47,048
Jerry Lee!

91
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:52,921
No matter what...

92
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,625
I want you two
to stay together.

93
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,540
Sorry.

94
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:44,843
I really am, Frank.

95
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:47,614
Let's go eat somethin'.

96
00:07:48,783 --> 00:07:51,384
I don't feel like
being around anyone.

97
00:07:53,654 --> 00:07:56,623
I'm gonna get you some-
some soup or somethin'.

98
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:58,658
Alright.

99
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,869
One day you were feelin'
like shit,

100
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,871
so you stole Dad's credit card

101
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,073
and drove to
the Cotton Tail Ranch.

102
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,876
You met this girl there, Candy.

103
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:56,881
And in the course of a week
you spend 4,000 dollars on her.

104
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:57,849
She was good.

105
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:01,019
You made that clear,
she was damn good.

106
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,587
You read her
one of your stories

107
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,856
while she sat on her knees.

108
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:05,891
When you were done,

109
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,392
she told you the hummer
was on the house

110
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,161
'cause your story
was that good.

111
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,599
You were on a roll so you got
a room and became a shut-in.

112
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:15,034
A man on a mission.

113
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:18,938
You didn't sleep for two days,
and wrote four stories.

114
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:22,842
Th last one,
your masterpiece,

115
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:24,945
starred Candy
as a lonely Asian stripper.

116
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:28,949
It was called "Hey Candy,
it's me Romeo".

117
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:31,919
You decided to get some rest
and see the last frontiers,

118
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:33,954
so you drove to Alaska.

119
00:12:34,923 --> 00:12:36,890
But it's colder than shit
in Alaska,

120
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:40,128
and you started to feel guilty
about Dad and his credit card.

121
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,097
So you drove back to Reno,

122
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:44,265
and bought a solid gold watch
with diamonds,

123
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:45,867
and gave it to him.

124
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:47,569
He didn't know what to think.

125
00:12:47,571 --> 00:12:50,473
a couple of days later he got
the credit card bill

126
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:54,110
and the son-of-a-bitch had you
committed to a mental hospital.

127
00:12:54,112 --> 00:12:56,879
But it sure beat workin'.

128
00:12:56,881 --> 00:12:58,881
You had all kinds of meds...

129
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,618
and green grass as far as
the eye can see.

130
00:13:03,588 --> 00:13:05,388
And you didn't feel bad
about Dad anymore

131
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,125
because that watch
you gave him...

132
00:13:08,127 --> 00:13:10,660
was a nice fuckin' watch.

133
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,936
What the fuck were you
thinkin', Jerry Lee?

134
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:33,118
Frank, Frank!

135
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,686
Hey Polly Flynn.

136
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,989
Jesus, you were in there forever.

137
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:40,125
Thank for leavin' the note.

138
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:41,426
He said he didn't have the nerve

139
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:43,228
to shoot himself in the head.

140
00:13:43,964 --> 00:13:46,132
You know he stole my gun?

141
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:47,033
My gun.

142
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,003
What'd he do?

143
00:13:51,138 --> 00:13:54,040
Whatever it is,
I didn't do anything.

144
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:23,539
Frank,

145
00:14:24,975 --> 00:14:26,642
I'm doing really well.

146
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:30,246
I've moved to Elko
in a small apartment.

147
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:34,050
I still think about you.

148
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:35,751
Do you think we'll see
any bears?

149
00:14:35,753 --> 00:14:37,087
Maybe.

150
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:40,724
Come on.

151
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:44,494
It would be really wonderful
to hear from you.

152
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:45,862
But I understand.

153
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:48,065
- Who's place is it, again?
- I dunno.

154
00:14:49,602 --> 00:14:51,069
Love, Annie.

155
00:14:51,071 --> 00:14:54,172
Aah, whiskey.

156
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:57,141
It's like they knew
we were comin'.

157
00:15:00,412 --> 00:15:02,247
I wish we lived here.

158
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:06,218
I could make apple pie,

159
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,453
you could hunt deer.

160
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:09,622
You know how to make
apple pie?

161
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:10,656
No.

162
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:13,592
It's okay.

163
00:15:14,294 --> 00:15:16,363
I don't think
I could shoot a deer.

164
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:20,867
Jerry Lee could even have
his own room.

165
00:15:23,237 --> 00:15:24,704
Or maybe you'll play
for the Yankees,

166
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:28,141
and we'll come here
to get away from all your fans,

167
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:29,644
and the reporters.

168
00:15:29,646 --> 00:15:31,879
Like a secret hide-out
or something.

169
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:37,518
God, I wish we lived here.

170
00:15:55,906 --> 00:15:58,908
Hi. I'm getting a check
for Flannigan.

171
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:02,412
Here you go.

172
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,417
Flannigan!

173
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:09,953
Where the hell've you been?

174
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:11,121
I had to hire someone else.

175
00:16:11,123 --> 00:16:13,357
I know, I just came by
to pick up my check.

176
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:14,858
You shoulda called.

177
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,361
You know, whatever it was,
maybe I coulda helped.

178
00:16:19,698 --> 00:16:21,065
Yeah?

179
00:16:56,838 --> 00:16:58,405
Do you have a phone book?

180
00:17:08,384 --> 00:17:10,251
Say goodbye to Daddy.

181
00:17:32,376 --> 00:17:34,277
I can't go to jail, Frank.

182
00:17:35,246 --> 00:17:37,414
You're not gonna go to jail.

183
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,748
Okay? Nobody knows anything.

184
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,250
We just lay low.

185
00:17:40,252 --> 00:17:41,752
If anyone finds out,

186
00:17:41,754 --> 00:17:43,954
if the police or anyone
finds out,

187
00:17:43,956 --> 00:17:45,956
you gotta get me outta here.

188
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,292
They ain't gonna find out.

189
00:17:53,098 --> 00:17:55,667
This TV's starting to
drive me crazy.

190
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,640
That poor kid.

191
00:18:07,447 --> 00:18:09,182
You see Polly Flynn?

192
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:11,651
I pretended like I was
asleep.

193
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:20,860
I ain't never been in love,
Frank.

194
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:25,933
Marge is the only girl for me,
I guess.

195
00:18:25,935 --> 00:18:28,168
And she's just a picture I
draw.

196
00:18:30,305 --> 00:18:34,074
It sure don't feel like love
with Polly Flynn.

197
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:36,311
If it does at all,
it's when we're fuckin'.

198
00:18:37,746 --> 00:18:40,748
Sometimes I feel like
I love her then.

199
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,550
Never anytime else, though.

200
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:46,087
But then...

201
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:48,824
I used to feel that when I
used to fuck that fat old lady

202
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:50,493
when we were staying
at the Silver State.

203
00:18:52,362 --> 00:18:54,497
Even then when I was about
to let go,

204
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:57,333
I felt like I wanted to marry her.

205
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,436
Here you go.

206
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,173
Thanks.

207
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:09,779
At least you've been in love,
Frank.

208
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:16,320
I don't care what you say,
that girl really did like you.

209
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,289
All she ever did was talk
about you.

210
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,434
Hey.

211
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:33,572
You want one of these?

212
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:34,806
Alright.

213
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,342
Hey Gary.

214
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,410
Frank.

215
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,758
I went by and I sat with him
yesterday.

216
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:55,029
Seein' him there like that...

217
00:19:55,031 --> 00:19:56,096
it's hard not to think about

218
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:58,399
the night that you guys
jumped the train.

219
00:19:59,568 --> 00:20:01,902
Yeah, I've been thinkin'
about that too.

220
00:20:04,706 --> 00:20:07,442
Why do you think he did it,
Frank?

221
00:20:08,411 --> 00:20:10,445
I don't know much...

222
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:13,848
but what worries me is you
guys just fuckin' split.

223
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,417
Did you at least cover it up
at work?

224
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:16,217
No.

225
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:18,620
We just left, I was...

226
00:20:18,622 --> 00:20:20,856
drunk, and Jerry Lee
was so upset,

227
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:22,358
he was out of his mind.

228
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,460
But that looks bad.

229
00:20:24,462 --> 00:20:26,629
I mean, somebody
starts askin' around...

230
00:20:26,631 --> 00:20:29,432
and now you're both fucked.

231
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:30,499
I know.

232
00:20:33,605 --> 00:20:36,506
Why don't you ever come down
on him, Frank?

233
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:42,145
'Ey.

234
00:20:42,147 --> 00:20:43,213
Come on.

235
00:20:43,748 --> 00:20:46,083
Luck of the Flannigans.

236
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:48,019
Almost worse than mine.

237
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:53,491
Almost.

238
00:20:57,429 --> 00:20:58,730
Uh...

239
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,136
Jerry Lee said you owe him
some money.

240
00:21:05,772 --> 00:21:07,473
Yeah, I do.

241
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,775
Yeah, look, I owe him
that money

242
00:21:09,777 --> 00:21:11,610
and I will pay you, Frank.

243
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:14,481
I would pay you but...

244
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,483
I've been bettin'
the playoffs

245
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:19,486
and I fuckin' lost
the last three weeks.

246
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,490
I'm down a couple grand, man.

247
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,795
I shoulda bet it
on the Tyson Douglas fight,

248
00:21:27,797 --> 00:21:29,463
that's what I shoulda done.

249
00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:33,267
Buster Douglas is gonna win
that fight, Frank.

250
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:35,670
Christ, Tommy.

251
00:21:35,672 --> 00:21:38,506
Besides Jerry Lee, you're
the unluckiest guy I know.

252
00:21:38,508 --> 00:21:40,509
Don't you read the papers?

253
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:43,311
Jesus, nobody thinks Buster
Douglas is gonna make it

254
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:44,880
outta the first round.

255
00:21:45,682 --> 00:21:47,282
Hey guys.

256
00:21:47,684 --> 00:21:49,151
Guess where I've been.

257
00:21:49,153 --> 00:21:50,686
I dunno, where ya been, Al?

258
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:52,821
I've been in the loony bin.

259
00:21:52,823 --> 00:21:56,225
- Could I get a vodka cranberry?
- Sure, hon.

260
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:58,061
Ugh, come on.

261
00:21:58,063 --> 00:22:01,698
I happened upon a bottle
of liquid acid.

262
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,033
And I couldn't stop takin'
it.

263
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:05,702
I ended up walking'
down Virginia.

264
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:07,538
Right down the center
of town.

265
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,708
All I was wearing' was my
underwear and flip-flops.

266
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,711
Luckily I'm still half sane,
though.

267
00:22:13,713 --> 00:22:15,979
They say they try
to get you straight...

268
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:18,515
but they make you crazier
than hell.

269
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:21,586
I ain't never going back
to that place again.

270
00:22:21,588 --> 00:22:24,556
Don't get thrown in the
mental hospital Frank.

271
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:26,591
It's worse than you think.

272
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:56,623
It's alright, kid.

273
00:22:58,226 --> 00:23:00,128
Are you alright?

274
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,862
What?

275
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:03,631
I said are you alright?

276
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,770
- Hey Barry!
- Yeah, Dad?

277
00:23:08,772 --> 00:23:11,038
We're gonna go grab
a bite to eat.

278
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,773
Okay.

279
00:23:11,775 --> 00:23:13,776
Okay, just get me somethin'.

280
00:23:13,778 --> 00:23:16,211
I dunno, where're you guys
going'?

281
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:19,314
We're gonna eat the ass-end
out of a dead skunk.

282
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:21,216
Get mine with ketchup!

283
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,619
The boy's sick.

284
00:23:27,925 --> 00:23:31,261
I'm sure sorry to hear about
your brother's leg.

285
00:23:31,263 --> 00:23:35,632
What, six months
after losin' your mom?

286
00:23:35,634 --> 00:23:37,634
And you're only what...

287
00:23:37,636 --> 00:23:38,803
sixteen?

288
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:41,071
I just turned fifteen.

289
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:44,074
I hired you when you were
fourteen?

290
00:23:44,076 --> 00:23:45,643
Yeah.

291
00:23:46,611 --> 00:23:47,912
Jesus.

292
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:50,648
Well, there you go.

293
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:56,621
What were you thinkin'
out there?

294
00:23:56,623 --> 00:23:59,691
I mean, when you were just
standin' there.

295
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,860
I dunno.

296
00:24:02,662 --> 00:24:04,196
Guess I was just..

297
00:24:04,198 --> 00:24:05,698
scared.

298
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:08,167
I'd be scared too.

299
00:24:09,036 --> 00:24:10,636
Look, son...

300
00:24:10,638 --> 00:24:13,806
what you gotta do is think
about the life you want.

301
00:24:13,808 --> 00:24:16,642
Think about it in your head.

302
00:24:16,644 --> 00:24:18,846
Make it a place you wanna be.

303
00:24:18,848 --> 00:24:22,482
A ranch, a beach house,
penthouse,

304
00:24:22,484 --> 00:24:24,618
doesn't matter what it is,

305
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,654
but a place you can go
hide out in.

306
00:24:27,656 --> 00:24:29,823
Then when everybody's
on your ass,

307
00:24:29,825 --> 00:24:32,827
or you can't stop thinkin'
about your mom,

308
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:34,696
you can go there.

309
00:24:35,831 --> 00:24:37,498
Could it help my brother?

310
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,700
I dunno.

311
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:40,802
Tell him yours.

312
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:44,339
I used to tell Barry stories
all the time

313
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:46,742
when his life was rough.

314
00:24:46,744 --> 00:24:48,510
They seemed to help him out.

315
00:24:48,512 --> 00:24:51,213
Gave him a place to escape to.

316
00:24:52,716 --> 00:24:55,150
Gave him some hope.

317
00:24:55,152 --> 00:24:57,286
Hope's the key.

318
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:10,934
Hey, boy.

319
00:25:17,276 --> 00:25:19,176
What an asshole.

320
00:25:19,912 --> 00:25:22,246
Come on.

321
00:25:25,184 --> 00:25:27,886
This is Mission Control

322
00:25:27,888 --> 00:25:29,288
at Houston,

323
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:33,859
at three hours, two minutes
into the flight of Discovery.

324
00:25:43,103 --> 00:25:44,971
It's hard to tell if they're
awake or not.

325
00:25:46,974 --> 00:25:48,808
You look better.

326
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,843
I feel better.

327
00:25:51,913 --> 00:25:54,315
Did they say anything
about your leg?

328
00:25:54,317 --> 00:25:55,149
They ain't sure.

329
00:25:56,584 --> 00:26:00,754
Depends if they can stop
some sort of infection I got.

330
00:26:00,756 --> 00:26:05,293
At least I shot myself in the
leg that was already bad.

331
00:26:05,295 --> 00:26:06,661
Yeah.

332
00:26:07,163 --> 00:26:08,830
You're drunk, huh?

333
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,566
Yeah.

334
00:26:19,977 --> 00:26:21,744
You should drink more milk,
Frank.

335
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:25,881
Hey.

336
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:29,385
You find anything out
about the kid?

337
00:26:30,587 --> 00:26:32,022
Not much.

338
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:34,992
His name was Wes Denny.

339
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:37,461
He lived in a house,
some sorta foster place I think.

340
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:38,962
I talked to a guy
who knew him.

341
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,330
Said...

342
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,866
his parents died in a car
crash,

343
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:45,003
and he'd been shuffled
between homes

344
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:46,037
his whole life, you know.

345
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,706
I mean, nobody really gave
a shit about him.

346
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:53,044
For real?

347
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:55,046
Yeah.

348
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,784
- You ain't makin' it up?
- No.

349
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,554
He was like us, you know.

350
00:27:03,223 --> 00:27:05,557
He didn't have anybody left.

351
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:17,871
I might have got us a dog.

352
00:27:17,873 --> 00:27:18,938
What?

353
00:27:21,842 --> 00:27:22,909
No shit.

354
00:27:22,911 --> 00:27:24,145
Oh yeah.

355
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,647
Where- where'd you get it?

356
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:29,183
Stole it from some guy's
yard.

357
00:27:29,185 --> 00:27:34,255
I mean, he was gonna have frozen
to death if I hadn't, but...

358
00:27:34,257 --> 00:27:36,590
We always wanted a dog.

359
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,828
Damn, that's somethin', huh?

360
00:27:41,064 --> 00:27:43,198
Frank, that's really
something'.

361
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,466
Yeah.

362
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,007
Frank?

363
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:30,249
Can we go somewhere else,
Frank?

364
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:31,984
What happened?

365
00:28:31,986 --> 00:28:34,019
- It's nothing.
- Here, sit down.

366
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,227
Can we leave- levee?

367
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,998
Just stay here.

368
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,234
You gotta get away
from your mom.

369
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:50,504
Can you at least
just tell me a story

370
00:28:50,506 --> 00:28:52,139
like the ones you tell
Jerry Lee?

371
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:54,007
Yeah.

372
00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:56,009
What do you want it
to be about?

373
00:28:59,982 --> 00:29:05,153
Maybe it could be you and me
on an island...

374
00:29:05,155 --> 00:29:06,988
in the Pacific Ocean.

375
00:29:08,157 --> 00:29:10,092
With the sun.

376
00:29:12,762 --> 00:29:15,998
And we could go swimming
all day long.

377
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And sleep on the beach.

378
00:30:09,022 --> 00:30:11,224
I'm Officer Cook,
this is Officer Mori.

379
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,826
We'd like to ask you a few
questions, okay?

380
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:18,198
What kind of car do you
drive, Mr. Flannigan?

381
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,132
A Chevy Caprice.

382
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:22,102
Where is your car?

383
00:30:22,104 --> 00:30:23,237
It was stolen.

384
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,138
Why didn't you report it?

385
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,774
It's a real piece of shit.

386
00:30:28,443 --> 00:30:30,712
It's been stolen
a few times before.

387
00:30:30,714 --> 00:30:33,581
Uh, we found your car,
Mr. Flannigan.

388
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,583
It was burned and abandoned.

389
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:37,852
Where was the car
stolen from?

390
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:46,862
Uh, The Sands-
Sands parking lot.

391
00:30:46,864 --> 00:30:48,631
I leave it there all the time.

392
00:30:48,633 --> 00:30:50,232
I live down...

393
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:52,901
Rancho Sierra, it's just
right down the street.

394
00:30:52,903 --> 00:30:54,270
Are you aware that someone
might have been killed

395
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:55,639
by an old beat-up car like yours

396
00:30:55,641 --> 00:30:57,040
in a hit-and-run?

397
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:57,807
No.

398
00:30:57,809 --> 00:30:59,276
A nurse getting off work

399
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:01,044
reported seeing a brown
and grey station wagon

400
00:31:01,046 --> 00:31:04,114
She said she saw someone
moving something out of the car

401
00:31:04,116 --> 00:31:05,882
right where the body
was found.

402
00:31:05,884 --> 00:31:07,550
What color's your car?

403
00:31:07,552 --> 00:31:09,186
It's brown and grey.

404
00:31:10,555 --> 00:31:13,124
Whoever stole it probably
did that, right?

405
00:31:13,126 --> 00:31:15,993
Why are you in the hospital,
Mr. Flannigan?

406
00:31:17,129 --> 00:31:18,262
My leg...

407
00:31:18,264 --> 00:31:19,497
What happened to your leg?

408
00:31:19,499 --> 00:31:21,132
Please, I'm just tired,

409
00:31:21,134 --> 00:31:22,901
I've had enough, okay?

410
00:31:22,903 --> 00:31:25,937
Can you just leave me alone,
just for a little bit?

411
00:31:25,939 --> 00:31:27,639
Doesn't look like you're
goin' anywhere.

412
00:31:27,641 --> 00:31:29,675
We have your room number
at the rancho Sierra.

413
00:31:29,677 --> 00:31:31,176
We'll be back to see you soon.

414
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:46,292
Fuck, Frank.

415
00:31:46,294 --> 00:31:47,527
What are we gonna do?

416
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:49,163
We're not gonna do anything.

417
00:31:49,165 --> 00:31:50,130
They don't know shit.

418
00:31:50,132 --> 00:31:51,999
They already know, I can tell.

419
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:54,168
- They already know.
- No they don't. Okay?

420
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,469
Thy don't know anything
for sure.

421
00:31:55,471 --> 00:31:58,138
They will, they'll find out.
You know that.

422
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,173
You gotta get me outta here, now.

423
00:31:59,175 --> 00:32:00,341
No.

424
00:32:00,343 --> 00:32:02,344
Okay, you gotta stay here
until you get better.

425
00:32:02,346 --> 00:32:04,679
I'm gonna go crazy
if they come back.

426
00:32:04,681 --> 00:32:07,015
Just get me outta here, Frank.

427
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:26,569
What are you doin'
with a Winchester?

428
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:28,171
What's he got there?

429
00:32:28,173 --> 00:32:30,073
His dad's rifle.

430
00:32:32,176 --> 00:32:33,210
What is it?

431
00:32:34,011 --> 00:32:38,248
It's a custom gold-plated
Winchester 1894...

432
00:32:42,354 --> 00:32:45,223
and I don't think this
thing's ever been fired.

433
00:32:45,225 --> 00:32:47,225
My brother and I never shot
it.

434
00:32:47,227 --> 00:32:49,227
My mom said my dad got it on
one of his lucky streaks.

435
00:32:49,229 --> 00:32:53,398
I think he got it
just before he took off.

436
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,667
Who'd he win it from?

437
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:57,236
'm not sure.

438
00:32:57,238 --> 00:32:59,204
I looked it up before.

439
00:32:59,206 --> 00:33:02,841
It ain't on any stolen list
that I've come across.

440
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:06,445
What're you gonna do with it?

441
00:33:06,447 --> 00:33:08,214
I was hoping you could buy it.

442
00:33:08,216 --> 00:33:10,183
I don't think I can give you
the kind of money

443
00:33:10,185 --> 00:33:11,785
this thing is worth.

444
00:33:11,787 --> 00:33:14,220
You should put a ad up
on Gun Trader,

445
00:33:14,222 --> 00:33:17,257
or wait until the next gun
show in March.

446
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:18,691
I'm in a spot.

447
00:33:19,627 --> 00:33:21,562
All I could give you is 400.

448
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:24,231
And I don't recommend
you take it.

449
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:26,534
That's just all I could give
you for it.

450
00:33:28,804 --> 00:33:30,538
I'll take the 400.

451
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:34,342
Okay.

452
00:33:35,912 --> 00:33:39,448
Tommy, get him some coffee.

453
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,349
And make him take
these donuts.

454
00:33:45,655 --> 00:33:49,292
You guys are leavin',
aren't you?

455
00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:51,427
That's what you need
the money for?

456
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,129
I dunno.

457
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:58,000
400 bucks ain't much
to hit the road with,

458
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:59,302
if that's your plan.

459
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:01,572
Yeah, I know.
And we don't even have a car.

460
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:06,243
You can get a piece of shit
for 300, I dunno.

461
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,312
I was thinkin' of going over
to Earl Hurley's lot,

462
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:09,813
he'd set up credit with me.

463
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:12,115
Yeah, you could do that.

464
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,319
I might have a better option.

465
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:18,256
The Tyson Douglas fight.

466
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:20,325
I don't think so, Tommy.

467
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:21,326
Hey.

468
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:24,395
Frank, Frank! Come here.

469
00:34:25,698 --> 00:34:29,335
Listen, look, I know
this one's good.

470
00:34:29,337 --> 00:34:31,270
And- and- and I just...

471
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:34,306
I just need help gettin'
there.

472
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:37,343
I just need a little bit of money.
- Tommy.

473
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:39,845
It's Jerry Lee, okay?

474
00:34:41,516 --> 00:34:43,884
Hey man, I'll give you my
car.

475
00:34:43,886 --> 00:34:46,353
The odds are 40 to 1.

476
00:34:46,355 --> 00:34:48,488
We bet 250 cash.

477
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:49,289
Alright?

478
00:34:49,857 --> 00:34:51,791
That means, worst case,

479
00:34:51,793 --> 00:34:54,495
you're walkin' out of there
with at least 150 bucks cash

480
00:34:54,497 --> 00:34:55,796
and my car.

481
00:35:00,335 --> 00:35:01,936
When's the fight?

482
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:04,071
Tonight.

483
00:35:06,174 --> 00:35:08,544
I want the keys to your car.

484
00:35:08,546 --> 00:35:12,414
Right before we place the bet,
okay, I get the keys.

485
00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:13,181
Deal?

486
00:35:13,183 --> 00:35:14,783
It's a deal, Frank.

487
00:35:16,085 --> 00:35:20,523
And don't tell Jerry Lee about
selling' the old man's gun.

488
00:35:20,525 --> 00:35:22,559
My brother loved that
asshole.

489
00:35:38,443 --> 00:35:41,545
Jesus, Al, what the hell
happened to you?

490
00:35:41,547 --> 00:35:43,781
You're not gonna fuckin'
believe it, Frank.

491
00:35:45,551 --> 00:35:48,119
Walkin' home last night,
after I rented a movie,

492
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:50,422
a couple of those fucking
redneck bastards

493
00:35:50,424 --> 00:35:51,590
were waiting for me

494
00:35:51,592 --> 00:35:53,425
outside that gay bar
on Virginia.

495
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:56,728
The one with the numbers
on the outside.

496
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,731
Near the vegetarian joint,
you know.

497
00:35:59,733 --> 00:36:01,601
A - a -anyway...

498
00:36:01,603 --> 00:36:03,569
they, uh, called me a queer,

499
00:36:03,571 --> 00:36:05,571
they pushed me down,
and, uh,

500
00:36:05,573 --> 00:36:08,608
kicked the shit outta me,
man.

501
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,409
I thought I was gonna die.

502
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:11,811
it was that bad.

503
00:36:12,613 --> 00:36:15,482
finally I just curled up
into a cannonball,

504
00:36:15,484 --> 00:36:16,817
and tried to wait it out,
you know?

505
00:36:16,819 --> 00:36:17,818
Yeah.

506
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,486
All cuz I was walkin' by
that place

507
00:36:19,488 --> 00:36:22,055
and wearing my acid-washed
jean jacket.

508
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:24,458
- I mean, what the fuck?
- Jesus, let me see.

509
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,359
It's just a jacket.

510
00:36:26,629 --> 00:36:27,996
Fuck, I didn't even know who
the fuck those guys were.

511
00:36:27,998 --> 00:36:30,231
I never seen them before
in my life, Frank.

512
00:36:32,001 --> 00:36:33,167
Hi.

513
00:36:33,169 --> 00:36:35,637
Gue- gue- guess what movie
I was renting.

514
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:36,638
What?

515
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,675
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
for Christ's sakes.

516
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:40,876
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!

517
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:45,481
it was a Saturday and I felt like
bein' in a good mood, you know?

518
00:36:45,483 --> 00:36:46,582
Yeah.

519
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,485
Fuck, man.

520
00:36:53,457 --> 00:36:56,626
Shit, I remember one of 'em
stole the movie.

521
00:36:56,628 --> 00:36:59,629
He- he- he- he picked it up
and looked at it,

522
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:01,264
and then he just took it.

523
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:03,500
What kind of sick fuck steals
a movie?

524
00:37:03,502 --> 00:37:04,634
Hey, Al...

525
00:37:04,636 --> 00:37:06,470
your nose is... startin'...

526
00:37:06,472 --> 00:37:07,672
Fuck.

527
00:37:07,674 --> 00:37:09,173
Ah, shit.

528
00:37:15,881 --> 00:37:19,551
Jesus Christ, I thought you
weren't gonna show up.

529
00:37:19,553 --> 00:37:20,485
I told you I'd be here.

530
00:37:20,487 --> 00:37:22,020
Fight's startin' in an hour.

531
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:24,489
You're a crazy bastard
if you go through with it.

532
00:37:24,491 --> 00:37:26,525
Hey, shut the fuck up, Al.

533
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:29,961
Heh, I wouldn't bet dead dick
on Buster Douglas.

534
00:37:29,963 --> 00:37:31,697
Hey, Frankie, don't listen to Al.

535
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:33,499
Remember he just got out
of the loony bin.

536
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:37,036
Buster Douglas is gonna
bust the shit out of him.

537
00:37:37,038 --> 00:37:38,504
No he ain't.

538
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:40,973
Hey.

539
00:37:40,975 --> 00:37:43,176
The Tyson Douglas fight
is about to begin.

540
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,979
Please place your final bets
in the sports book upstairs.

541
00:37:45,981 --> 00:37:49,483
And good luck from your
friends at the Cal-Neva Casino.

542
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:06,935
250 on Douglas, please.

543
00:38:06,937 --> 00:38:08,703
The undefeated

544
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:11,573
heavyweight champion
of the world!

545
00:38:11,575 --> 00:38:14,543
Mike Tyson!

546
00:38:17,748 --> 00:38:19,749
We're almost 90 seconds
in and as yet,

547
00:38:19,751 --> 00:38:23,586
Tyson has done no real damage
to Buster Douglas.

548
00:38:23,588 --> 00:38:25,789
All that can change
with one big shot.

549
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:27,624
It's always sudden death.

550
00:38:30,228 --> 00:38:31,962
That was a good round
for Douglas.

551
00:38:31,964 --> 00:38:34,431
Probably the best round
I've ever seen him fight.

552
00:38:34,433 --> 00:38:36,600
Let's see if Douglas can
sustain it.

553
00:38:38,737 --> 00:38:41,606
Tyson seems less aggressive
than is normally the case,

554
00:38:41,608 --> 00:38:43,808
perhaps a little frustrated.

555
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,744
This is totally
uncharacteristic of Mike Tyson.

556
00:38:46,746 --> 00:38:48,746
He's just- he's not on.

557
00:38:48,748 --> 00:38:50,915
That's a good right hand,
and a good right uppercut,

558
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:53,051
and two good right hooks
by Douglas!

559
00:38:53,053 --> 00:38:55,120
He got it, he got it,
he got it, he got it.

560
00:38:55,122 --> 00:38:56,989
I don't think I've seen Tyson absorb

561
00:38:56,991 --> 00:39:00,592
this kid of punishment
ever in his professional career.

562
00:39:00,594 --> 00:39:04,062
Another right hand and now
Tyson seems to be wobbling!

563
00:39:04,064 --> 00:39:06,966
Buster Douglas is completely
dominating this round!

564
00:39:06,968 --> 00:39:09,135
Please move out of the way,
thank you.

565
00:39:12,807 --> 00:39:15,642
And down goes Douglas!

566
00:39:17,012 --> 00:39:19,814
As suddenly as that!

567
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,582
Fuck, fuck, get up!

568
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:23,818
- I told you.
- Come on! Get up!

569
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,853
Tyson came off the ropes

570
00:39:25,855 --> 00:39:28,789
with that terrific right uppercut.

571
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:31,258
Buster!
I love you Buster!

572
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,028
Let's see what Mike
can do to finish.

573
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,630
And the bell sounds
to save Buster Douglas

574
00:39:35,632 --> 00:39:37,499
at the end of round eight.

575
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,870
Tyson needed something
like that desperately,

576
00:39:41,872 --> 00:39:43,872
to show the real champion
that he is.

577
00:39:43,874 --> 00:39:46,843
Let's see what Douglas can do
when he comes out

578
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:48,277
for the next round.

579
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:50,813
Clearly he was out on his
feet as the bell sounded.

580
00:39:50,815 --> 00:39:53,816
Oh! What a right hand by
Tyson to begin the tenth round!

581
00:39:53,818 --> 00:39:55,651
Douglas comes back with a left
and a right!

582
00:39:55,653 --> 00:39:57,820
Three solid shots,
right on Tyson's face!

583
00:39:57,822 --> 00:39:59,723
Douglas comes back with a left
and a right!

584
00:39:59,725 --> 00:40:01,058
Tyson is wobbling!

585
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,493
Oh! Oh! Oh!

586
00:40:04,496 --> 00:40:07,497
Holy shit! Holy shit!

587
00:40:23,816 --> 00:40:27,486
9,450.

588
00:40:27,488 --> 00:40:28,721
Holy fuck.

589
00:40:28,723 --> 00:40:30,689
That's more money
than I've ever had.

590
00:40:30,691 --> 00:40:32,658
That's more money
than I've ever seen.

591
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,059
It barely fits in my wallet.

592
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:35,761
Let's go to the strip club.

593
00:40:36,897 --> 00:40:38,765
Have fun, Al.

594
00:40:51,713 --> 00:40:52,780
Here.

595
00:40:58,186 --> 00:41:00,588
I was right, Frank.

596
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,724
This time I was fuckin' right.

597
00:41:03,726 --> 00:41:05,260
You were.

598
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:45,170
I just don't want a minivan

599
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:46,972
or another fucking
station wagon.

600
00:41:46,974 --> 00:41:48,039
Okay.

601
00:41:48,574 --> 00:41:50,942
Hey, now that we've got
some dough...

602
00:41:50,944 --> 00:41:53,812
We'd probably be able to find
the kid's folks easier.

603
00:41:53,814 --> 00:41:55,747
They gotta be out there
somewhere.

604
00:41:55,749 --> 00:41:56,948
I don't think he's got anyone.

605
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:00,186
Frank, everybody's
got somebody, alright?

606
00:42:00,188 --> 00:42:02,321
And if we find 'em we can
give 'em some of the money.

607
00:42:02,323 --> 00:42:03,756
What if I can't find 'em?

608
00:42:03,758 --> 00:42:04,890
You will.

609
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:06,959
And when you do find 'em...

610
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:10,831
maybe we'll get 'em some
subscriptions to magazines.

611
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,799
Who knows what they like, but...

612
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:14,801
most people like magazines.

613
00:42:14,803 --> 00:42:16,536
I'll try.

614
00:42:16,538 --> 00:42:17,938
Okay.

615
00:42:39,162 --> 00:42:42,564
How the hell are you,
Frank Flannigan?

616
00:42:44,868 --> 00:42:46,835
What the hell are you doing
out there

617
00:42:46,837 --> 00:42:49,138
in this goddamned weather?

618
00:42:51,475 --> 00:42:54,010
I haven't seen you
in a long fuckin' time.

619
00:42:54,012 --> 00:42:55,478
It's been years, ain't it?

620
00:42:58,016 --> 00:42:59,049
Well...

621
00:42:59,051 --> 00:43:00,917
I need a car, Earl.

622
00:43:00,919 --> 00:43:01,885
Today?

623
00:43:03,855 --> 00:43:07,024
It's goddamned Ice-land
out there.

624
00:43:07,026 --> 00:43:10,161
Seems like a strange day
to be buyin' a car.

625
00:43:16,334 --> 00:43:17,502
Well, hell, kid,

626
00:43:17,504 --> 00:43:19,838
what kinda car you want to buy?

627
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,907
I got 1,500 to spend.

628
00:43:21,909 --> 00:43:25,277
I don't wanna set up
a payment plan or anything.

629
00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:27,979
I was hoping' to just
pay cash on it.

630
00:43:28,881 --> 00:43:30,450
You have anything
in that ballpark?

631
00:43:30,452 --> 00:43:33,119
Well, I got a couple
that might do ya.

632
00:43:33,121 --> 00:43:36,956
A 1985 Honda Civic.

633
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:38,357
Maybe somethin' bigger, Earl.

634
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:41,360
Maybe somethin' you might
be able to sleep in.

635
00:43:42,629 --> 00:43:46,366
Jesus, that's
a horrible fuckin' thought.

636
00:43:48,703 --> 00:43:51,872
I got a Dodge Dart
that Barry picked up.

637
00:43:53,908 --> 00:43:55,242
Like the kind on the walls?

638
00:43:55,244 --> 00:43:58,179
Not that nice, but yeah,
the same car.

639
00:43:59,915 --> 00:44:02,117
I'll take the Dart.

640
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:04,986
I'll knock off
a couple a hundred..

641
00:44:04,988 --> 00:44:08,723
if you can go out there
and get it started yourself.

642
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:29,679
Well, don't do anything stupid.

643
00:44:29,681 --> 00:44:31,248
Tryin' not to.

644
00:44:33,351 --> 00:44:35,852
You're not a loser, kid.

645
00:44:38,123 --> 00:44:42,360
But if you keep actin' like
one, then I don't know.

646
00:44:42,362 --> 00:44:44,028
What I'm sayin' is...

647
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:49,000
don't make decisions
thinkin' you're a low-life.

648
00:44:49,002 --> 00:44:52,638
Make decisions thinkin'
you're a great man.

649
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,606
At least a good man.

650
00:44:56,142 --> 00:44:58,710
Don't be a goddamned pussy.

651
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,014
Got a girlfriend?

652
00:45:04,018 --> 00:45:05,185
I used to.

653
00:45:05,187 --> 00:45:07,187
Well, there you go, see?

654
00:45:07,189 --> 00:45:09,822
Some board
thinks you're alright.

655
00:45:17,999 --> 00:45:20,100
Take care of yourself.

656
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,744
Frank. Frank!

657
00:47:02,746 --> 00:47:03,979
What?

658
00:47:03,981 --> 00:47:05,747
Shit, Frank! Where the fuck
have you been?

659
00:47:05,749 --> 00:47:07,282
What happened?

660
00:47:07,284 --> 00:47:09,451
Two cops were at my place.

661
00:47:26,804 --> 00:47:28,138
Jesus Christ, are we doin' it?

662
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,140
Yeah, but we gotta go now.
Alright?

663
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:32,309
Get me my boot.

664
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:41,252
Thanks for comin' to get me,
Frank.

665
00:47:46,192 --> 00:47:47,359
Ah!

666
00:47:47,361 --> 00:47:48,960
Alright, let's go.

667
00:47:50,629 --> 00:47:51,730
Come on, Frank.

668
00:47:51,732 --> 00:47:53,231
Excuse me, sirs!

669
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:02,908
Where are we gonna go?

670
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,176
Elko.

671
00:48:04,178 --> 00:48:05,578
What's in Elko?

672
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,246
I dunno.

673
00:48:10,386 --> 00:48:11,918
Yeah, this way.

674
00:48:13,221 --> 00:48:14,388
Right there.

675
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,555
No shit?

676
00:48:15,557 --> 00:48:17,591
- A Dodge Dart?
- Yeah, it runs good!

677
00:48:17,593 --> 00:48:18,992
Wow.

678
00:48:32,207 --> 00:48:34,276
Hola amigo!

679
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:35,244
Hey!

680
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:06,410
Cousin Harvey,
you know, he was big.

681
00:49:06,412 --> 00:49:08,446
Tall as a mountain, six foot five.

682
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:11,081
Aunt Shea thinks he's
a gold mine.

683
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:12,483
A pile of gold.

684
00:49:12,485 --> 00:49:14,719
She was so mean to him,
eventually he ran away,

685
00:49:14,721 --> 00:49:16,321
went to San Francisco.

686
00:49:17,423 --> 00:49:19,291
That's horrible.

687
00:49:22,995 --> 00:49:24,262
Wanna come out
of the blanket?

688
00:49:24,264 --> 00:49:25,797
Come on buddy.

689
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:28,000
He gets beat up at every
single game he plays.

690
00:49:28,002 --> 00:49:29,268
Every single game.

691
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:31,471
Ended up bein' some kind
of computer genius.

692
00:49:31,473 --> 00:49:33,272
A millionaire.

693
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:35,541
Who's got my fucking key?

694
00:49:51,025 --> 00:49:53,360
Tell me about that one
about the pirates.

695
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:03,271
Nice and warm?

696
00:50:10,046 --> 00:50:11,347
After Mom died...

697
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:14,383
we left Reno...

698
00:50:14,385 --> 00:50:16,652
and set sail for Hawaii.

699
00:50:16,654 --> 00:50:18,521
But on the way
we got shanghaied

700
00:50:18,523 --> 00:50:21,324
by a bunch of crazed pirates.

701
00:50:21,326 --> 00:50:25,061
The captain was a
cross-dressing homicidal maniac.

702
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:28,398
Lethal with guns, knives,
and nunchakus.

703
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,499
And the crew...

704
00:50:29,501 --> 00:50:31,535
they were just a bunch
of lunatics

705
00:50:31,537 --> 00:50:34,071
that the captain kept
addicted to morphine.

706
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:36,307
We spent months
trapped on that ship.

707
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:37,909
Working like slaves.

708
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:39,477
Then, one night,

709
00:50:39,479 --> 00:50:42,580
Captain comes out of his
quarters in a yellow bikini.

710
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:45,383
He does this amazing
swan dive.

711
00:50:45,385 --> 00:50:47,019
Like in the olympics.

712
00:50:47,021 --> 00:50:49,888
The crew all followed him in.

713
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:53,358
You and me saw a school
of sharks around the boat.

714
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,460
It was a real bloodbath.

715
00:50:56,396 --> 00:50:57,763
The sea was rough.

716
00:50:57,765 --> 00:51:00,333
But you took control.

717
00:51:00,335 --> 00:51:02,402
You were a natural.

718
00:51:04,539 --> 00:51:07,407
We washed ashore
on this island.

719
00:51:07,409 --> 00:51:10,410
We were nursed back to health
by this guy.

720
00:51:10,412 --> 00:51:12,412
Old Man Jenkins.

721
00:51:12,414 --> 00:51:15,849
He taught us
how to shoot guns.

722
00:51:15,851 --> 00:51:19,453
And man, he looked just like
Willie Nelson.

723
00:51:20,555 --> 00:51:22,456
And the girls there,
they were beautiful.

724
00:51:24,392 --> 00:51:26,361
Turns out they thought
we were kings.

725
00:51:27,396 --> 00:51:29,631
So we decided to stay a while.

726
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,911
Man, it's a mess.

727
00:52:14,913 --> 00:52:16,514
Can we go?

728
00:52:17,483 --> 00:52:19,852
I just wanna get
to where we're goin'.

729
00:52:21,287 --> 00:52:23,789
Okay.

730
00:53:17,047 --> 00:53:18,481
I missed my Marge.

731
00:53:19,516 --> 00:53:21,984
I like the indian choppin'
the cowboy's head off

732
00:53:21,986 --> 00:53:23,319
with the tomahawk.

733
00:53:23,321 --> 00:53:25,556
Yeah, that's a good one.

734
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:29,593
I'm gonna go get somethin'
to eat.

735
00:53:29,595 --> 00:53:30,994
What do you want?

736
00:53:30,996 --> 00:53:32,763
I ain't hungry.

737
00:53:32,765 --> 00:53:34,565
Sort of thirsty, though.

738
00:53:34,567 --> 00:53:36,200
Get me some water?

739
00:53:36,202 --> 00:53:37,935
Maybe doe popsicles?

740
00:53:38,938 --> 00:53:39,771
Yeah.

741
00:53:40,573 --> 00:53:42,373
The three amigos.

742
00:53:47,713 --> 00:53:49,647
Be back soon.

743
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:05,632
Oh, thanks

744
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,643
That's the girl.

745
00:54:16,645 --> 00:54:17,677
Oh yeah?

746
00:54:18,413 --> 00:54:20,681
The real badass.

747
00:54:27,656 --> 00:54:28,623
How was it?

748
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:29,891
It was good.

749
00:55:09,668 --> 00:55:11,703
Who the fuck is that?

750
00:55:19,812 --> 00:55:21,379
Hello?

751
00:55:21,381 --> 00:55:22,681
Annie.

752
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:33,826
Hi Frank.

753
00:55:33,828 --> 00:55:34,927
Hello.

754
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:06,095
I work at a bakery.

755
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:08,931
It's a good job.

756
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,904
I live in an apartment
not far from here.

757
00:56:14,906 --> 00:56:16,772
Smaller than any motel
I've ever stayed in,

758
00:56:16,774 --> 00:56:18,508
but it's pretty nice.

759
00:56:19,944 --> 00:56:21,244
I painted it.

760
00:56:21,246 --> 00:56:23,113
It has a full kitchen.

761
00:56:23,115 --> 00:56:24,814
What color did you paint it?

762
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,753
Um...

763
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:31,956
The bathroom I painted white.

764
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:34,191
It was dark green.

765
00:56:34,193 --> 00:56:36,727
And the front room...

766
00:56:36,729 --> 00:56:38,796
I painted a sorta cream
color.

767
00:56:39,898 --> 00:56:41,465
Look's good.

768
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:45,470
So, you guys on vacation?

769
00:56:46,706 --> 00:56:47,773
No.

770
00:56:47,775 --> 00:56:49,775
No, it's, uh...

771
00:56:50,276 --> 00:56:51,777
...nothing like that.

772
00:56:52,812 --> 00:56:54,046
You two ready to order?

773
00:56:54,781 --> 00:56:56,548
I'm too nervous to eat.

774
00:56:57,818 --> 00:57:00,954
I'll have a piece of apple pie
and coffee.

775
00:57:00,956 --> 00:57:01,854
You got it.

776
00:57:12,934 --> 00:57:14,301
I still think about you.

777
00:57:14,936 --> 00:57:16,870
All the time, I do.

778
00:57:20,976 --> 00:57:22,876
I think about you too.

779
00:57:23,846 --> 00:57:25,680
I'm really glad you're here.

780
00:57:59,884 --> 00:58:01,018
Alright?

781
00:58:01,953 --> 00:58:04,222
I don't know how long
I can stand here, Frank.

782
00:58:04,224 --> 00:58:05,890
Okay.

783
00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:09,961
My hair smells
pretty fuckin' bad though.

784
00:58:13,165 --> 00:58:14,866
Shampoo.

785
00:58:14,868 --> 00:58:17,302
- Alright?
- Yeah.

786
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:20,806
Yeah.

787
00:58:21,908 --> 00:58:23,976
I'm fuckin' naked
in front of you.

788
00:58:23,978 --> 00:58:25,711
That's okay.

789
00:58:26,046 --> 00:58:27,946
That's okay.

790
00:58:30,384 --> 00:58:32,585
You got a pretty big dick,
Jerry Lee.

791
00:58:32,587 --> 00:58:33,887
Thank you.

792
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:36,856
Holy shit!
Luck of the Flannigan's.

793
00:58:36,858 --> 00:58:38,892
I think you got all that
luck.

794
00:58:38,894 --> 00:58:40,860
Alright out your head under.

795
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,168
Think I can rinse the back?

796
00:58:49,037 --> 00:58:50,604
Alright, okay.

797
00:58:50,606 --> 00:58:52,173
- Okay.
- We'll get the back.

798
00:58:53,942 --> 00:58:56,244
Way back, long time ago,

799
00:58:56,246 --> 00:59:01,083
our dad got a job a a salesman
at Used Car Magic.

800
00:59:01,085 --> 00:59:02,284
Aunt Bernie got him the job.

801
00:59:02,286 --> 00:59:04,352
She was the aunt
that used to give him

802
00:59:04,354 --> 00:59:09,091
Penthouse, and Hustler,
and Playboy for slashin' tires.

803
00:59:09,093 --> 00:59:10,293
Anyway...

804
00:59:10,295 --> 00:59:12,895
The lot was owned by a guy
named Ike,

805
00:59:12,897 --> 00:59:16,899
who was like old Earl Hurley,
but was a Jesus Freak.

806
00:59:16,901 --> 00:59:19,302
He drank and smoked and
cheated on his wife,

807
00:59:19,304 --> 00:59:22,004
but he also loved God.

808
00:59:23,641 --> 00:59:27,945
One day, this bombshell Iris
walked onto the lot with Biff,

809
00:59:27,947 --> 00:59:31,882
a great dane/ Russian
wolf hound cross.

810
00:59:31,884 --> 00:59:34,751
She was lookin' for a
Mustang.

811
00:59:34,753 --> 00:59:37,489
Dad went to get the keys
to the '64 convertible.

812
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:38,590
He says to Ike,

813
00:59:38,592 --> 00:59:40,959
"the woman of my dreams
just walked in. "

814
00:59:40,961 --> 00:59:42,560
Ike said, "Remember,

815
00:59:42,562 --> 00:59:44,395
let the words trickle
down your tongue,

816
00:59:44,397 --> 00:59:46,131
like the fruits of Jesus. "

817
00:59:46,133 --> 00:59:47,966
"You're cute. " she said,

818
00:59:47,968 --> 00:59:49,969
and moved her legs
slightly apart.

819
00:59:49,971 --> 00:59:52,104
"Hell yeah" Dad thought.

820
00:59:52,106 --> 00:59:55,574
"Iris, I'm gonna
blow your mind. "

821
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,410
They pull dover on a dirt road,

822
00:59:58,412 --> 01:00:00,913
and Iris stood on the hood
shooting lizards

823
01:00:00,915 --> 01:00:03,917
with her stainless steel
Winchester. 357,

824
01:00:03,919 --> 01:00:05,986
while Dad ate fried chicken.

825
01:00:06,954 --> 01:00:09,122
They did it on the hood,

826
01:00:09,124 --> 01:00:12,192
while Iris shot the gun off
over his head.

827
01:00:13,996 --> 01:00:18,366
Dad said it was the best
experience of his life.

828
01:00:20,536 --> 01:00:21,602
Next thing he knows,

829
01:00:21,604 --> 01:00:23,004
they're stopped off
at Iris' house

830
01:00:23,006 --> 01:00:24,572
so she could shower.

831
01:00:26,175 --> 01:00:28,109
Suddenly, the police broke in
and screamed,

832
01:00:28,111 --> 01:00:30,045
"Drug raid!"

833
01:00:31,147 --> 01:00:34,049
They found a pound of weed,
an M-16,

834
01:00:34,051 --> 01:00:36,151
and a crate
of Russian grenades.

835
01:00:38,188 --> 01:00:40,222
Irish shouted,
"Let him go!

836
01:00:40,224 --> 01:00:42,158
He's just a man
I found yesterday,

837
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,160
a man who would have changed
my life,

838
01:00:44,162 --> 01:00:47,664
and led me down the path
to righteousness!"

839
01:00:47,666 --> 01:00:49,332
After only a week in jail,

840
01:00:49,334 --> 01:00:51,568
Iris was stabbed five times
in the neck,

841
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:54,070
while getting a prison-issued
haircut.

842
01:00:55,172 --> 01:00:59,009
Dad was sad as hell,
cuz he really loved Iris.

843
01:00:59,011 --> 01:01:01,679
It was a hard time,
until one day,

844
01:01:01,681 --> 01:01:03,214
about a year later,

845
01:01:03,216 --> 01:01:06,150
our mother walked
onto the dusty lot.

846
01:01:08,053 --> 01:01:11,590
Ike took Dad aside.
"Jimmy," he said,

847
01:01:11,592 --> 01:01:15,026
"I think this might be
the next gal for you. "

848
01:01:15,028 --> 01:01:17,095
Then he gave him
a hundred buck bonus,

849
01:01:17,097 --> 01:01:18,563
and the rest of the day off.

850
01:01:18,565 --> 01:01:19,931
The end.

851
01:01:22,236 --> 01:01:25,171
That's a hell of a story,
Frank.

852
01:01:27,241 --> 01:01:30,576
That damn woman,
she was somethin', huh?

853
01:01:30,578 --> 01:01:34,880
I liked the part about fuckin'
and shooting' the gun off.

854
01:01:34,882 --> 01:01:37,251
It's too bad Iris had to die.

855
01:01:37,253 --> 01:01:39,086
But then he wouldn't
have met Mom, and...

856
01:01:39,088 --> 01:01:40,954
we wouldn't be here.

857
01:01:41,456 --> 01:01:44,057
I didn't want her to, but...

858
01:01:44,059 --> 01:01:45,158
she just did.

859
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,094
You know...

860
01:01:47,895 --> 01:01:49,230
A lot of the stories you tell,

861
01:01:49,232 --> 01:01:51,332
the cool girl dies at the end.

862
01:01:52,735 --> 01:01:56,271
I mean, that one about the
parachute didn't open for her.

863
01:01:56,273 --> 01:01:59,240
Then the girl got caught
on the rocks.

864
01:01:59,242 --> 01:02:02,911
She ran outta air in her SCUBA
tank before we could get to her.

865
01:02:02,913 --> 01:02:06,048
And then there were those sand people,
or whatever they were...

866
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:07,883
they tortured her to death.

867
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,487
Yeah.

868
01:02:14,759 --> 01:02:16,359
It's good that we're here.

869
01:02:20,164 --> 01:02:22,065
I'm gonna sleep to that story.

870
01:02:24,268 --> 01:02:26,970
Let's not talk anymore.

871
01:02:27,438 --> 01:02:29,340
I don't wanna lose it.

872
01:02:51,964 --> 01:02:53,999
This is where I work.

873
01:02:55,602 --> 01:02:57,670
Seems like a nice place.

874
01:03:00,174 --> 01:03:02,408
Are you gonna stay here
for a while?

875
01:03:16,358 --> 01:03:19,159
Annie James, holy shit!

876
01:03:19,161 --> 01:03:20,194
Hi Jerry Lee.

877
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:23,365
I knew there was a reason
we came to Elko.

878
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:24,399
I just...

879
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:26,201
I couldn't figure it out.

880
01:03:26,203 --> 01:03:27,969
It's good to see you.

881
01:03:28,637 --> 01:03:30,638
I told her everything.

882
01:03:33,175 --> 01:03:34,310
Yeah?

883
01:03:36,246 --> 01:03:38,247
I guess it doesn't really matter.

884
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:42,718
I just wish it was me
instead of that kid, Annie.

885
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,786
I do.

886
01:03:44,221 --> 01:03:45,788
No, don't say that.

887
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:48,492
What would Frank do
without you?

888
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:59,669
Anyway, you guys, you should
go have some fun, huh?

889
01:03:59,671 --> 01:04:01,439
You gotta walk her home
anyway, Frank.

890
01:04:01,441 --> 01:04:03,374
No, he's gotta stay and keep
you company.

891
01:04:03,376 --> 01:04:05,376
no, we're good, right?

892
01:04:05,378 --> 01:04:07,745
We're pretty good here.

893
01:04:21,561 --> 01:04:23,529
Annie James.

894
01:04:24,898 --> 01:04:26,298
We gotta clean that.

895
01:04:32,273 --> 01:04:33,273
Aah!

896
01:04:33,275 --> 01:04:34,574
Alright.

897
01:04:34,576 --> 01:04:35,708
Fuck!

898
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:38,378
Fuck.

899
01:04:46,922 --> 01:04:48,222
Thanks.

900
01:04:48,224 --> 01:04:49,457
Yep. Over here.

901
01:04:49,459 --> 01:04:51,225
Hey boy. Hey.

902
01:05:15,652 --> 01:05:17,420
Hi.

903
01:05:19,656 --> 01:05:21,325
This is it.

904
01:06:01,168 --> 01:06:03,370
Why are you here, Frank?

905
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,440
To see you.

906
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:11,511
And to know that you're okay.

907
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:12,880
I am.

908
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:17,985
Yeah.

909
01:06:21,423 --> 01:06:23,257
So what now?

910
01:06:26,596 --> 01:06:28,163
I don't know.

911
01:06:34,904 --> 01:06:36,972
I know that I hurt you.

912
01:06:40,044 --> 01:06:41,244
Yeah.

913
01:06:47,251 --> 01:06:48,484
I know, yeah.

914
01:06:52,423 --> 01:06:53,791
I'm sorry.

915
01:07:16,415 --> 01:07:18,316
I'm sorry.

916
01:07:19,486 --> 01:07:20,953
I don't care.

917
01:07:20,955 --> 01:07:23,489
I hated doing that.

918
01:07:23,491 --> 01:07:25,524
What you saw, I really did.

919
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,461
She made me do it.

920
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:32,098
She went on and on about all
the things she's done for me.

921
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,401
And how that guy you saw
was gonna kill her.

922
01:07:34,403 --> 01:07:36,470
He really did say
he was gonna kill her.

923
01:07:36,472 --> 01:07:38,038
You should go.

924
01:07:38,473 --> 01:07:40,073
I'll walk you out.

925
01:07:40,075 --> 01:07:41,441
I can't lose you, frank.
Really I can't.

926
01:07:41,443 --> 01:07:44,444
I can't go back there.
No, please!

927
01:07:44,446 --> 01:07:46,481
Frank, please!

928
01:07:49,618 --> 01:07:51,586
Frank!

929
01:08:03,133 --> 01:08:04,500
Frank.

930
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:06,468
Hey Frank, wake up.

931
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:07,536
What time is it?

932
01:08:07,538 --> 01:08:09,505
I dunno, all I know
is I gotta take a leak,

933
01:08:09,507 --> 01:08:12,475
and I don't think I can get up
by myself.

934
01:08:12,477 --> 01:08:13,443
Alright.

935
01:08:16,147 --> 01:08:17,514
Well, come on, Frank.

936
01:08:17,516 --> 01:08:19,683
I'm about to piss myself.

937
01:08:19,685 --> 01:08:22,218
If I do, I'm takin' your bed.

938
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:28,526
Ah, the greatest feeling
I've ever had.

939
01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:41,506
I think this is the longest piss
I think I've ever pissed, Frank.

940
01:08:41,508 --> 01:08:43,508
I'm gonna be sick soon.

941
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:45,477
I'm almost done.

942
01:08:53,253 --> 01:08:54,620
Frank.

943
01:09:00,694 --> 01:09:04,097
Maybe you should just
drink beer from now on.

944
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:07,735
I mean it looked like you
drank half that bottle.

945
01:09:07,737 --> 01:09:09,503
you know Willie Nelson,
he said whiskey

946
01:09:09,505 --> 01:09:11,605
was the only thing that
almost killed him.

947
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:13,707
More than any other drug,

948
01:09:13,709 --> 01:09:16,777
and I'm sure he tried them all,
you know...

949
01:09:16,779 --> 01:09:18,580
Sure he has.

950
01:09:34,731 --> 01:09:36,599
How ya feelin'?

951
01:09:39,102 --> 01:09:41,170
I'm having nightmares.

952
01:09:47,545 --> 01:09:49,679
Mind if I have one of those?

953
01:10:06,598 --> 01:10:08,866
We drank a lot of beers.

954
01:10:11,337 --> 01:10:12,638
Didn't we, Frank?

955
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:15,574
Yeah, I guess so.

956
01:10:20,647 --> 01:10:24,082
Hey, that probably ain't
too good for you.

957
01:10:33,961 --> 01:10:35,895
It can't be that bad.

958
01:10:41,703 --> 01:10:44,238
So, you think you could live
in Elko?

959
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:47,675
I think it could be pretty
nice,

960
01:10:47,677 --> 01:10:49,710
You know, it's, uh...

961
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:52,681
...it's different.

962
01:10:52,683 --> 01:10:54,816
You gonna start
seeing her again?

963
01:10:54,818 --> 01:10:56,751
I don't know.

964
01:10:58,688 --> 01:11:01,690
You still ain't ever told me
what happened.

965
01:11:01,692 --> 01:11:03,658
Yeah, well you probably
wouldn't like her too much

966
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:04,961
if you knew.

967
01:11:06,864 --> 01:11:09,699
I think I have
a pretty good idea, though.

968
01:11:14,137 --> 01:11:15,705
You ever tell anyone?

969
01:11:19,677 --> 01:11:22,279
You never talk about
anything, Frank.

970
01:11:24,883 --> 01:11:26,750
I know you
better than anybody.

971
01:11:28,887 --> 01:11:31,322
I don't even know
what you're thinkin' anymore.

972
01:11:33,726 --> 01:11:36,728
It doesn't have to be me,
I guess...

973
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:40,231
It's just not good
to hold things in.

974
01:11:42,434 --> 01:11:44,670
If you read the Willie book,
you'd know that.

975
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:04,257
I went down to the Sutro
that night.

976
01:12:05,126 --> 01:12:06,526
And uh...

977
01:12:06,528 --> 01:12:08,194
saw her like that.

978
01:12:08,196 --> 01:12:09,696
With some guy.

979
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:11,766
And uh...

980
01:12:11,768 --> 01:12:13,267
with her...

981
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:16,771
down to her bottom underwear.

982
01:12:16,773 --> 01:12:20,942
With her bare knees on that
old carpet.

983
01:12:20,944 --> 01:12:24,012
With her- with her mom
in the room.

984
01:12:28,151 --> 01:12:30,285
Well, she's had a hard life.

985
01:12:31,955 --> 01:12:33,822
I mean, her mom's a hooker
for chrissakes.

986
01:12:33,824 --> 01:12:34,790
I keep...

987
01:12:34,792 --> 01:12:38,328
seeing her knees in my mind,
you know?

988
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:40,496
We're fuck-ups, Frank.

989
01:12:41,999 --> 01:12:44,867
We're gonna be with people
who are fuck-ups.

990
01:12:46,937 --> 01:12:48,104
And...

991
01:12:48,106 --> 01:12:49,405
to me...

992
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:52,676
to me that makes sense.

993
01:12:57,949 --> 01:13:00,818
You're the loneliest guy I
know, Frank.

994
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,822
Everyone says that.

995
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:06,891
Even Tommy says that.

996
01:13:11,831 --> 01:13:14,265
All I've ever done is fuck
up.

997
01:13:14,267 --> 01:13:15,633
Don't say that.

998
01:13:15,635 --> 01:13:16,836
Oh come on.

999
01:13:16,838 --> 01:13:20,339
I ain't never had a woman
tell me that she loved me.

1000
01:13:20,341 --> 01:13:21,674
You have.

1001
01:13:22,376 --> 01:13:24,944
Annie told you that,
didn't she?

1002
01:13:27,848 --> 01:13:28,848
Yeah.

1003
01:13:28,850 --> 01:13:30,217
See?

1004
01:13:32,053 --> 01:13:33,820
I ain't never done anything.

1005
01:13:33,822 --> 01:13:35,655
We're just getting' started.

1006
01:13:35,657 --> 01:13:36,923
Maybe.

1007
01:13:38,893 --> 01:13:42,562
No girl's gonna fuck a guy
with one leg.

1008
01:13:42,564 --> 01:13:44,966
A guy who's killed a kid.

1009
01:13:48,003 --> 01:13:50,304
Now, I'm just telling' you
the truth.

1010
01:13:52,408 --> 01:13:55,376
I'm just telling' you the
truth.

1011
01:14:02,919 --> 01:14:04,486
I made you somethin'.

1012
01:14:15,666 --> 01:14:17,500
I drew this for you.

1013
01:14:22,908 --> 01:14:25,009
Oh, man.

1014
01:14:27,946 --> 01:14:29,947
That's funnier than hell.

1015
01:14:32,884 --> 01:14:34,018
Hey.

1016
01:14:36,355 --> 01:14:38,957
You're a good man,
Frank Flannigan.

1017
01:14:39,926 --> 01:14:41,626
You are.

1018
01:14:46,099 --> 01:14:47,632
I love you.

1019
01:15:22,005 --> 01:15:23,404
You were heading
towards Iceland

1020
01:15:23,406 --> 01:15:25,974
And there was nothing
you could do.

1021
01:15:35,952 --> 01:15:39,555
Your plane crashes into
a goddamned blizzard.

1022
01:15:43,961 --> 01:15:45,362
You're almost snow-blind,

1023
01:15:45,364 --> 01:15:47,297
when a polar bear
the size of an elephant

1024
01:15:47,299 --> 01:15:49,032
starts chasing you.

1025
01:15:50,001 --> 01:15:52,202
you pull out
your pearl-handled. 45

1026
01:15:52,204 --> 01:15:54,171
and out one round
right through it's brain,

1027
01:15:54,173 --> 01:15:56,007
killing it dead.

1028
01:16:00,812 --> 01:16:04,649
You take out your Air Force
issue pocket knife

1029
01:16:04,651 --> 01:16:06,617
and carve up a hole in the
polar bear,

1030
01:16:06,619 --> 01:16:08,252
and jump inside.

1031
01:16:10,323 --> 01:16:11,957
You walk all night,

1032
01:16:11,959 --> 01:16:13,959
and in the morning
you come across a cabin,

1033
01:16:13,961 --> 01:16:16,562
and hear a girl
screaming inside.

1034
01:16:16,564 --> 01:16:19,531
She's naked, tied face down
on the bed.

1035
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:22,068
An old guy with a whip
stands over her,

1036
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:26,039
and goddamn if he isn't doin'
a line of cocaine off her ass.

1037
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:28,007
A line the size of a deer
antler.

1038
01:16:28,009 --> 01:16:30,577
You kick in the door,
pull out your gun,

1039
01:16:30,579 --> 01:16:34,047
and say, "Sir, I am a lieutenant
in the American Air Force.

1040
01:16:34,049 --> 01:16:36,016
Put down that whip. "

1041
01:16:36,018 --> 01:16:39,186
Then the girl comes flying out
and stabs him in the throat

1042
01:16:39,188 --> 01:16:40,187
with a kitchen knife,

1043
01:16:40,189 --> 01:16:42,189
and blood squirts everywhere.

1044
01:16:42,191 --> 01:16:45,059
And you leave his body
to the wolves.

1045
01:16:46,228 --> 01:16:47,695
Her name's Marge.

1046
01:16:47,697 --> 01:16:51,199
She tells you you're the
greatest man she's ever met.

1047
01:16:51,201 --> 01:16:54,035
You end up fallin' in love.

1048
01:16:54,037 --> 01:16:57,405
Goddamn if a meteor doesn't
come flyin' from the sky

1049
01:16:57,407 --> 01:16:59,374
and crash right next
to your cabin.

1050
01:16:59,376 --> 01:17:03,012
Oil starts shootin' out
100 years high.

1051
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:06,249
What's going on?

1052
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:08,150
Sir, please move back.

1053
01:17:11,255 --> 01:17:13,055
"Honey" you ask her,

1054
01:17:13,057 --> 01:17:15,092
"you own this land?"

1055
01:17:15,094 --> 01:17:19,096
"No, we own this land. "
she says and hugs you.

1056
01:17:19,098 --> 01:17:21,098
"Goddamn. " you say.

1057
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,600
"We're gonna be millionaires. "
