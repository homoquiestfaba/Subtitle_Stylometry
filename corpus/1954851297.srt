1
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,255
Walk downstairs.

2
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:41,193
14 steps total... 14.

3
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:46,098
Step through the front door.

4
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,802
68 degrees outside... 68.

5
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,605
Reaching 97,

6
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:56,041
back to 65

7
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,744
tonight when you're
back inside.

8
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,681
Three...

9
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:06,985
Oh, shit! Goddamn it!

10
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:12,157
Oh, good. You're awake.

11
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,226
That makes one of us.

12
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:16,662
I'm awake now, that's for sure.

13
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:22,367
I stepped on my keys.

14
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,503
Those little buggers can hurt!

15
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,505
What were your keys
doing on the floor

16
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,407
of the upstairs hallway anyway?

17
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,676
Oh, wait. Let me guess.

18
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:33,679
Um, you dropped them
last night mid-swig

19
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:36,315
or mid-something else.

20
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:39,885
You know, I did hear
stu start to, um,

21
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,520
moan.

22
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:44,356
Yeah, like a man moan.

23
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,991
Maybe we should ask him.

24
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:48,660
He's not here anymore.
We scared him off.

25
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,896
Happy?

26
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,699
And at least I have keys.

27
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:56,201
At least I have use for keys.

28
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:58,403
Just say the word,
and these are yours.

29
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,147
You packed.

30
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,453
I washed your lucky shirt.

31
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,521
Oh, and I, uh,

32
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:19,424
I called them again.

33
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,660
Double-checked about the ride.

34
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:26,732
Uh, the van's windows
will be tinted.

35
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:29,635
The driver will
never go above 55,

36
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,703
on or off the highway.

37
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,273
Barely even feel
like you're moving.

38
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,112
And You'll have the back row

39
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,114
all to yourself.

40
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,249
No one will even be
able to look at you.

41
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,818
It's just how
you like it, right?

42
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,527
Right?

43
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,964
One...

44
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,674
Half red, half blue.

45
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,980
Half white and half red.

46
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,025
Was that dad on the phone?
Mm-hmm.

47
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,395
While I was in the shower?
Mm-hmm.

48
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,832
And what did he say?

49
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:10,135
Wanted to wish you
a Bon voyage.

50
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:13,071
What did you say? I told him
you were in the shower.

51
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,743
Oh, and that he and his new
wife are festering boils

52
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:21,113
that should be lanced
from the ass of humanity.

53
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,649
Good, right?

54
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,257
You took only three, right?

55
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,159
Of course.

56
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,163
You want to check them?

57
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,399
And If we're missing some,
It's only 'cause stu

58
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,567
boosted a few on his way out.

59
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,274
His name is Steve
Hayes, not stu.

60
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:50,976
Sorry.

61
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,552
So you were saying that

62
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,188
she missed her graduation.

63
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,424
Graduation, senior prom,

64
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:08,460
junior prom before
that... all of it.

65
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,629
Anything to avoid
another attack, huh?

66
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,231
So the last one was when?

67
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:16,701
Are you the driver
or the doctor?

68
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,804
Look, I'm just the guy who's
trying to get your daughter

69
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,672
from here to there, that's it.

70
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,879
Uh, the last one was
about six months ago.

71
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,614
Six months.

72
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,483
Tried going for a walk.

73
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:34,019
About a minute in,
she started to choke.

74
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,656
And, um,

75
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:41,493
along came shrink number four

76
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:45,797
and prescription number seven.

77
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,233
So now she's got her pills

78
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,769
and her birds

79
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,771
and her computer and me

80
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,639
bringing meals to her room.

81
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,309
So she won't eat down here?

82
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,911
She won't come down here.

83
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,314
She hasn't for months.

84
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,783
Well, that kind of limits
the social life, huh?

85
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:07,252
Hazel doesn't have
a social life.

86
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:09,554
I was talking about you.

87
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,692
No cuts, no scrapes,

88
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:16,628
no nicks, no scratches.

89
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,531
No cuts, no scrapes,

90
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,266
no nicks,

91
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,201
no abrasions.

92
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,672
No abrasions.

93
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,545
I can do it.

94
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,917
I can do it.

95
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,969
I can do it...

96
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,239
Alone.

97
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,924
Mm, I'm gonna need
all distractions.

98
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,859
I know, I know.

99
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,463
Tunnel vision.

100
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,699
I can do it.

101
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,971
Seven more steps.
Seven more steps.

102
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,973
Seven more steps.

103
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,649
Okay.

104
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,018
So there's your air, all right?

105
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,654
And there's your light,

106
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,789
and that is your eject button,

107
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,992
If at any point you just want
to come out and join the party.

108
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,596
That invitation's always open.
Okay, hazel?

109
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,798
You're gonna be fine
in there, hazel.

110
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,900
Snug as a bug. Nothing
can touch you.

111
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,505
I'll come with you, haze.

112
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,974
How's that?

113
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,109
I'll just come with
you for the ride.

114
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,518
Okay.

115
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,821
Yeah, all good.

116
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,856
On schedule.

117
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,992
Right-o,<i> jefe.</i>

118
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,394
You guys think
of everything, huh?

119
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,496
Oh, yeah, well,

120
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,532
we don't fool around.

121
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:44,502
Well, sometimes we do.

122
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,074
Hey, uh, we got Eddie

123
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,909
making a late-afternoon
return run.

124
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,911
He can bring you
right back If you want.

125
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,513
Oh, yeah?

126
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:58,183
Next return-around is tomorrow
morning, If you were wondering.

127
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,851
I don't know.

128
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:03,221
I'll keep that in mind, Mcdreamy.
Right.

129
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,998
Envision destination.

130
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,102
Eliminate all distractions.

131
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,177
You just can't
sit still, can you?

132
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:29,881
Look, Dee, seriously,
It's okay.

133
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:34,085
She's gonna love this place. You made
the right choice. It wasn't a choice.

134
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,254
Hazel just turned 18,

135
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,591
so her dear dad stopped
paying child support,

136
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,260
and he and his new wife
decided to hit us

137
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,863
with the old "threats
and ultimatums" move...

138
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,865
selling our house,
cutting off the checks

139
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,234
until hazel checks in,

140
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,970
which will only set
her back, believe me.

141
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:55,640
That's optimistic.
That's realistic.

142
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,215
Do I know you?
You look familiar.

143
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,384
Oh! I kept worrying

144
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,320
I'd go to, like,
the exact wrong place.

145
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:12,991
Hi. I'm Vicky. Hey.

146
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:16,628
Damn, some of us are antsy.

147
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,997
What, you've never been
to a sanitarium before?

148
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:22,300
Oh, sorry. Treatment resort.

149
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,278
<i>Continue on 22</i>

150
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,981
<i>west for 46 Miles.</i>

151
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,104
- You play golf, right?
- Professionally?

152
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:03,308
I did. I just lost my tour card.

153
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,678
I stopped making putts,
and I stopped eating meals.

154
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,680
My agents think I can
find both my stroke

155
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,616
and my appetite in the desert.

156
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:14,485
What about you?

157
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:17,021
What do you do? World bank.

158
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,224
Stressful gig?

159
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,061
I bet. So, what are you

160
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,563
trying to find out
in the desert?

161
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,298
Nothing.

162
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,801
Just six days' peace.

163
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,138
What about me? You guys
want to know about me?

164
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,774
Kleptomania.

165
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,678
Careful shaking hands
with a thief, mister.

166
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,214
I got lightning fingers.

167
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:48,286
Hey, you in front. Your turn.
What's wrong with you?

168
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,991
Nothing. At all.

169
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:56,160
Come on, you've
obviously got something.

170
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,496
These shades for you?

171
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,402
They were for my daughter.
She's in the back there.

172
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:11,442
Damn. I thought I had issues.

173
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,280
<i>Veer right in</i>

174
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:18,182
<i>point-one Miles.</i>

175
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,692
Yeah, Bennett,
we made the turnoff.

176
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:31,262
Everyone's fine, <i>Capitan.</i>

177
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,864
Yeah.

178
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,699
Do you hike?

179
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,735
I have lots of hiking stuff.

180
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,737
Well, I don't know.

181
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,873
These days I'm having enough
trouble with trail mix,

182
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,609
let alone actual trails.

183
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,045
Would you mind?

184
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:50,048
Jesus, relax, guy. You relax.

185
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,250
That girl just stole
a $15,000 watch.

186
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:56,788
I didn't steal it. I was joking.
Oh.

187
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,924
Very funny. Ha-ha.

188
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,493
You're just lucky I'm
traveling unattended.

189
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:06,064
Otherwise, your lightning fingers
would be in pieces right now.

190
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:09,100
Ooh! Big man! Who
normally attends you?

191
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:13,004
Is it Thor? Is it Wolverine?
Does he normally attend you?

192
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,406
No. Just somebody
who would have

193
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,942
no trouble pulverizing
a child thief

194
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:21,779
or her talentless,
anorexic crush.

195
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,348
Huh.

196
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,285
Are you sure It's just
six days of peace

197
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,354
you're looking for
in the desert?

198
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:32,123
'Cause I got to say,

199
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,760
from the vibe I get, I
have a much different read

200
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:38,463
on your... Condition.

201
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:41,432
I think you're just gay,

202
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,701
and you're having
a really hard time

203
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,837
wrestling with your latent

204
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,640
but potent urge
to be bent over.

205
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,109
- Excuse me?
- Uh, guys?

206
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:53,111
Why don't we, uh,

207
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,980
try getting a head start on that
whole "explore serenity" thing now.

208
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,816
Really, It's easy.

209
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,985
Just go with the flow.

210
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,554
No problems here, boss.
I'm from Los Angeles.

211
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,689
I don't have a problem
If this guy's a queer.

212
00:17:05,715 --> 00:17:06,549
Watch your mouth.

213
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:48,266
Nobody move! Shut up!
Give me your phones!

214
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,868
I said don't move!
Don't you move!

215
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,570
Don't move!

216
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,272

00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,540
Oh, your phone.

243
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:19,310
We'll just call someone.
We can call for help, and...

244
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,312
they took 'em.

245
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:24,015
All of 'em.

246
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,450
Um...

247
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:31,722
Maybe they have a-a first...

248
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,000
Okay.

249
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:45,136
Okay.

250
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,471
Okay. Dressing.

251
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,379
Is it... Is that...
Is that okay?

252
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,029
I'm sorry, all right?

253
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:14,665
Really, I am. I know... I know...

254
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,667
I know what you're gonna say...
"spilled milk. It's over."

255
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,969
But I just want you to know
that I'm really, truly sorry.

256
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:20,771
Yeah, you're sorry? Yeah.

257
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,440
You're sorry? Yeah.

258
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,141
I'm sorry. Why?

259
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:26,143
You know why? Why?

260
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,346
'Cause I bought blanks, Pru,
and I was a second away

261
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,348
from putting 'em in your piece,

262
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,350
but I didn't because I thought,

263
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,819
"what If the driver tags Pru?
I'll never forgive myself."

264
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:38,689
That chick, she just started laughing.
Why was she laughing?

265
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,991
She was in shock.

266
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:43,694
Pruitt, she was in shock. People do
strange things when they're in shock.

267
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,298
They laugh. Like ha, fucking ha.
You know that.

268
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,801
We got what we went for,
though, right?

269
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,703
We came for a girl,

270
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,872
not a girl
and four dead bodies.

271
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:01,212
We're not bad guys, Pru.
We don't wear black hats.

272
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,414
I told you, just like I
told you to stay calm, man.

273
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,583
Don't lose your shit.
Don't be a spastic!

274
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:17,027
Pru... Pruitt, I'm sorry.

275
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,430
You know I don't mean
to call you that.

276
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:22,266
I'm sorry.

277
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:25,736
You know everything I do... You do for me.
Like Bryan Adams.

278
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:29,240
Except... Except he
doesn't have a brother.

279
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,308
Doesn't have a brother.

280
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,549
Two males, two females.

281
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:41,519
Driver was a male; Our
girl with the curly hair.

282
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,621
Everything matched.

283
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:46,257
Did you get a good look
at the one in front?

284
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,192
No, no. The one with the hat?

285
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:51,762
I was just looking at the
hostage, like you said.

286
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:55,065
I got to call him.
I got to call him.

287
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:58,702
No loose ends, right? Ever.

288
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:00,471
Right.

289
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:05,476
<i>Turn left...</i>

290
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:08,379
Ohh. Um...

291
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:16,787
Well, that's fort defiance,

292
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,123
and It's only like...

293
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,926
Five or six Miles away, so...

294
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:24,895
I can go get help.

295
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,997
I can go get help. No.

296
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:30,267
Someone will come.

297
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,836
<i>U-turn...</i>

298
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:33,838
There are no cars
around here, mom.

299
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,440
I mean, why do you think
they did what they did

300
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:38,609
at this exact spot
in this time?

301
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:42,446
That's not one of
your computer maps, haze.

302
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:45,683
That's real desert out there.

303
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:47,918
Real sand, real wild animals.

304
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,254
Yeah, and a real reservation.

305
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:53,157
Five or six Miles away!

306
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,528
It would be hard enough
If it were five or six yards.

307
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,931
Thanks, mom.
That's real encouraging.

308
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:03,901
But I'm not helpless. No.

309
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,505
I-I'm doing this.

310
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,991
- You think we wanted to?
- We had to.

311
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:29,393
They got wild. They charged.
I shot first.

312
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:32,730
Yeah. He did fine.

313
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,598
He did fine.

314
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,302
All four others.

315
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,205
Look, I'm not happy about it
either, but what's done is done.

316
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:44,074
That's not why I've been
trying to get you.

317
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:46,844
I need to know about the girl.

318
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:48,946
No, not the hostage.
The other girl.

319
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,048
<i>You have arrived</i>

320
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,784
<i>at your destination.</i>

321
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:32,022
Okay, um, you have mace
in your purse, right?

322
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,964
Mom, what...

323
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:43,400
What's this?

324
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,436
It's probably Steve's.

325
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:48,572
I didn't know it was there.

326
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:51,675
And I'm the one who needs help?

327
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:02,219
Here. Take this.
It's important.

328
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,066
I always thought
I'd die quickly.

329
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:54,038
I don't know why.

330
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,276
Heart attack or a stroke.

331
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,681
In a Walmart.

332
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,284
Among the frozen foods.

333
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:09,820
Mom, I...

334
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:13,490
Please, I already told you,
I'm not listening to some stupid

335
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:16,560
goddamn deathbed speech, okay?

336
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:19,229
I'm gonna do this.

337
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,999
I'm gonna come back, and...

338
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:25,135
And I... I'm just gonna
have to do it tunnel-style.

339
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:27,905
Just gonna look at my feet

340
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:32,376
and-and-and eliminate
all distractions.

341
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:35,746
It'll be fine, and I
promise I'm coming back.

342
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,050
I can't. I can't.

343
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,036
One,

344
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,039
two...

345
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,189
You're gonna be fine.

346
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,124
You will.

347
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,561
It's just...

348
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:06,997
Jesse thinks
you might have a fever.

349
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,299
But he's... He's super careful.

350
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:11,301
He's careful, and he's caring.

351
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:13,737
Takes care of me.

352
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:16,840
He always has.

353
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:18,842
We have the same mom,

354
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:21,879
but she had him when
she was way younger.

355
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:24,147
He's, like,
part brother, part dad.

356
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:28,385
He's... He's my "Brad."

357
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,154
Mom, though,

358
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:34,224
she wanted me to be a girl.

359
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:37,060
That's why she hit me in the
head with a gravel rake.

360
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,996
Made me, um...

361
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,401
Hmm?

362
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,639
When Jesse found out, he...

363
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,944
He told her, "don't you
ever touch him again."

364
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,751
You got no one
to care about you, huh?

365
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:04,187
Is that wh...

366
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:07,124
Is that why you steal
cans of goya beans

367
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:09,126
even though
your dad's got, like,

368
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:12,062
600...

369
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:13,997
$600 million?

370
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,943
Huh?

371
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,349
Well, it is necessary. Very.

372
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:36,787
Right.

373
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,722
Yeah.

374
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,645
I'm caring too.

375
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:04,081
And honest.

376
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:06,016
And professional.

377
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,486
Hey! Get off her!

378
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,321
What the hell are you doing?
I was just...

379
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,256
you were just what?
You were just what?

380
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,425
You were just acting
unprofessional.

381
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:18,028
Again. Again!

382
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,966
You wrap her up

383
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:25,002
and get ready to move
out, understand? Right.

384
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:27,204
Safe house further on.

385
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:29,373
We're gonna make a couple of
stops first, get more sedative.

386
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:32,175
We're going back
to the van, Pru.

387
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,644
Wait. We're...
We're going back...

388
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:36,813
Yeah, we're going back to the van.
I worked it out.

389
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,182
We make another return
If I drive fast tonight.

390
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,184
I need you to
follow me, pruitt.

391
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:44,154
None of this bullshit,
you understand me?

392
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:46,456
Look at me.

393
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,065
She got agoraphobia,
in the front seat.

394
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:57,067
What was she doing
in the front seat?

395
00:33:57,069 --> 00:34:01,004
She was afraid
of all this space.

396
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:03,140
Shouldn't have been
in the front seat.

397
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,244
Do this.

398
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:18,021
Now, why do we need
a stronger sedative?

399
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:21,358
Because when the hostage
starts to squirm,

400
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,660
so does everyone else.

401
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:26,530
Good. And the kerosene?

402
00:34:26,532 --> 00:34:28,765
So that no matter what's there when we
arrive, nothing's there when we leave.

403
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:30,033
Good. Mm-hmm.

404
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:32,536
You take your pills? Yeah.

405
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:35,439
Yeah?

406
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:38,241
Yeah.

407
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:45,048
Okay, th...

408
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,851
This morning,
I just got so revved up,

409
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:51,288
'cause I was ready, and I couldn't
even think about taking my pills.

410
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:56,126
You take your goddamn pills.

411
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,762
No. What?

412
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:12,169
It's the same as
35 degrees longitude.

413
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:15,272
The sun is about

414
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:18,808
70 degrees above.

415
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,877
That makes

416
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:25,448
this one

417
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,217
my right road.

418
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,121
Definitely.

419
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,478
<i>- That was something jaunty</i>
<i>- To get your day going.</i>

420
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,214
<i>Now how about something</i>
<i>a little more melancholy?</i>

421
00:38:04,216 --> 00:38:06,283
<i>Here on "classical gas."</i>

422
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,688
Can't really handle
Mozart right now.

423
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,737
<i>Turn right.</i>

424
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:30,940
<i>End destination.</i>
<i>You have... you have...</i>

425
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:33,343
<i>u-turn.</i>

426
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,648
<i>U-turn.</i>

427
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,886
<i>U-turn.</i>

428
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,857
<i>U-turn.</i>

429
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:52,929
<i>U-turn.</i>

430
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:43,146
Oh, God!

431
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:46,816
Oh, God! Oh, God!

432
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:49,519
Oh, God!

433
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:52,889
God! Oh, God!

434
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:09,606
Shit!

435
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,219
Come on, Lyle.

436
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:25,088
Give it to me.

437
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,595
Oh, yeah.

438
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,932
And it feels good?

439
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,269
Oh, yeah. It feels good?

440
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,812
Oh, Lyle,

441
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:51,481
that doesn't feel good.

442
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,686
Don't you think we should
take it a little slower?

443
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,790
Please, Lyle,

444
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,293
get off!

445
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,075
Damn it.

446
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,446
No cuts. No abrasions.
No infections.

447
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:00,116
No nicks. No slashes.

448
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:02,352
Okay. Okay.

449
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,954
No cuts. No abrasions.

450
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:07,524
No infections.

451
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:10,727
No nicks. No slashes.

452
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:12,929
I'm okay.

453
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,066
Pill time.

454
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,056
Oh, It's dirty.

455
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:15,091
Dirty, dirty, dirty.

456
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,226
Okay.

457
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:19,128
Okay.

458
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:48,591
Right. Okay.

459
00:43:51,596 --> 00:43:54,197
I wish they made these
things smaller, you know?

460
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:02,138
What are you doing? Put it down.
Put it down.

461
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,407
We're gonna need guns again, right?
"Need"?

462
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:06,776
Yeah. Looks to me
like you want a gun,

463
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:09,812
and you should never
want a gun, Pru.

464
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:12,048
I know.

465
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,655
All right. Let's make
some time, yeah?

466
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:29,132
Come on, come on,
you've got to do this.

467
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:32,535
You've got to get out of here.

468
00:44:32,537 --> 00:44:36,372
How do you do it,
little birdie?

469
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:38,408
How do you manage?

470
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,746
How would you do this?

471
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,251
Last?

472
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,828
Okay.

473
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:01,030
Okay.

474
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,166
Forget about...

475
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:05,668
Forget about the destination

476
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,937
and only think about steps.

477
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,241
Find your route.

478
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:25,555
The cactus.

479
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:29,325
Okay.

480
00:45:29,327 --> 00:45:33,162
All you have to do
is get to the cactus.

481
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:36,532
Get to the cactus

482
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:40,069
150 yards away.

483
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,238
Each step you take

484
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,441
is closer to the cactus.

485
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,545
To the cactus.

486
00:45:49,547 --> 00:45:52,048
150 yards, next cactus.

487
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,650
All you have to do is
get to the next cactus.

488
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:59,148
"Why mom hates me."

489
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:05,288
My attitude.

490
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:10,927
"I'm not as strong as she is."

491
00:47:16,968 --> 00:47:19,735
"Sometimes
I make her feel dumb."

492
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:26,876
"What I did"

493
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:31,781
"or didn't do."

494
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:58,040
Just topical anesthetic, haze.

495
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:16,158
Oh, God!

496
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:36,579
Hello.

497
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:40,216
- Stay calm, yeah?
- Hello?

498
00:48:40,218 --> 00:48:42,985
Control. Always in control.

499
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:52,695
Hey, check it out.

500
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:02,138
Did you leave this open?

501
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,382
Son of a bitch!

502
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:16,152
I knew it! I knew it.

503
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:22,091
What kind of a wacko needs to
be in a cage to take a drive?

504
00:49:22,093 --> 00:49:25,261
Think she got a ride?

505
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:28,397
No one comes out here. She ran.

506
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,501
Question is, where?

507
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:36,605
Where?

508
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:38,641
Ah, damn it.

509
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,079
Maybe these footprints
would help.

510
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:59,395
Oh, God.

511
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,671
Keep moving. Keep going.

512
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:12,174
No stops, just steps.

513
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,210
The next cactus

514
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:17,480
is, um, 100 feet,

515
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:20,649
so that's just 100
feet closer to help

516
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:24,286
and 100 feet closer to mom.

517
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:42,805
Eliminate all distraction,
envision destination.

518
00:50:42,807 --> 00:50:46,108
Eliminate all distraction,
envision destination.

519
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,412
Tunnel vision.

520
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,619
It's okay, okay.

521
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,196
This is wrong.

522
00:51:40,198 --> 00:51:42,465
Very wrong.

523
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:46,635
It's way too steep,

524
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:49,238
and you know it.

525
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,475
I'm not listening to you.

526
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:55,845
I'm shutting you out
and shutting you up.

527
00:51:57,647 --> 00:52:01,083
Approach the drop.

528
00:52:01,085 --> 00:52:03,319
Take half-steps down

529
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:05,955
about 200.

530
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:12,394
Avoid crapping your pants.

531
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,242
Why won't you listen?

532
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:29,612
Because you're just
a mirage, okay?

533
00:52:29,614 --> 00:52:33,849
And a mirage is just a...
A reflected light, right?

534
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:11,440
How far you think she got?

535
00:55:11,442 --> 00:55:13,509
Oh, no more than a half mile.

536
00:55:13,511 --> 00:55:17,313
Girl had issues, remember?
Mm-hmm.

537
00:55:17,315 --> 00:55:21,250
You know, I'm thinking maybe
you stay back here, Pru.

538
00:55:21,252 --> 00:55:23,185
What? Yeah.

539
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:28,490
What are you talking about? You
don't want me to come with you?

540
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,826
No. This'll be quick.

541
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,928
I'll be right back.

542
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:39,301
You don't want me
to come with you?

543
00:55:39,303 --> 00:55:41,303
No, I was just...

544
00:55:41,305 --> 00:55:43,539
It's gonna be quick, you know?
I'll be right back.

545
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:46,875
I have skills. I'm a better shot.
You know it.

546
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:49,044
I know it. I know.
But we just need to

547
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:52,114
keep this situation controlled.

548
00:55:52,116 --> 00:55:54,016
Controlled.

549
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,455
Pru...

550
00:55:59,457 --> 00:56:01,457
All right.

551
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:10,199
Go ahead. You know your orders?

552
00:56:10,201 --> 00:56:13,569
Right? You're in control.

553
00:56:13,571 --> 00:56:15,871
Secure perimeter.

554
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,908
All right.

555
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:29,611
It's okay.

556
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:43,959
I know. I'm coming.

557
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,894
I'm coming.

558
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:49,965
Almost there.

559
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:56,605
Walking and I'm talking.

560
00:57:56,607 --> 00:57:58,974
I'm walking...

561
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:06,548
Walking...

562
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:20,829
Walking...

563
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:12,614
What?

564
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:23,986
Oh, my God.

565
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:07,095
This is good.

566
01:01:07,097 --> 01:01:09,131
Oh, yeah.

567
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:49,738
Got to be faster.
Got to be faster.

568
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:52,107
Got to be faster, pruitt.

569
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:55,077
Too slow.

570
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:04,519
We have, um, spinach.

571
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:07,089
I don't like spinach.

572
01:02:07,091 --> 01:02:09,357
It's such an ugly color.

573
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,893
It's so... dark.

574
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:14,830
You got lucky.

575
01:02:14,832 --> 01:02:17,532
Super lucky.

576
01:02:17,534 --> 01:02:20,335
Getting down here,

577
01:02:20,337 --> 01:02:22,270
in here.

578
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:27,242
But be careful,

579
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:30,212
because after good luck

580
01:02:30,214 --> 01:02:32,114
comes bad luck.

581
01:02:32,116 --> 01:02:34,850
Oh, please just stop it.

582
01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:38,053
Oh, my God. Just go away.

583
01:02:38,055 --> 01:02:40,722
I'm just trying to help.

584
01:02:40,724 --> 01:02:44,159
That's all.
Everyone needs help.

585
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:49,898
Please don't do this.

586
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,300
Please, I'm begging you.

587
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,487
Gracie...

588
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:22,130
Come on.

589
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:25,000
That was never
supposed to happen.

590
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:58,834
Hello?

591
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:04,005
Oh, well, just fuck me twice.
It's you.

592
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:06,174
I mean, you're, like, a person.

593
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,176
Like, a real, live person,

594
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,946
not a bat or a cat
or a... vision.

595
01:04:10,948 --> 01:04:14,716
I thought maybe... Hey,
you're not a vision, right?

596
01:04:14,718 --> 01:04:18,553
You're not Evie's ghost?

597
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:23,258
Here to give me
more fucking shit.

598
01:04:26,662 --> 01:04:28,663
I came out here
with my bike, see?

599
01:04:28,665 --> 01:04:31,199
Then I heard something.

600
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:34,002
And then I came, and I saw
something... a car in the rocks

601
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:36,037
this way, and spooky.

602
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:38,874
Then there's you in the car,

603
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:42,077
so... coincidence or a sign?

604
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,313
You have a bike?

605
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:51,219
Triumph bonneville 750.

606
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:54,589
I was riding... just a
little desert ride...

607
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:57,759
collect my thoughts,
I have this vision,

608
01:04:57,761 --> 01:05:01,329
and I got a little, I don't
know, out of my way.

609
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:03,665
It's cool, though, 'cause,
uh, every destination

610
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:06,501
is really just another
exit ramp, right,

611
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:09,571
on the highway of existence.
Huxley said that.

612
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:12,440
Aldous Huxley?

613
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:15,377
<i>Doors of perception?</i>
<i>Brave new world?</i>

614
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:17,412
No?

615
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:20,448
Is your bike close?

616
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:23,184
Jesus, don't any of you
fucking people read anymore?

617
01:05:23,186 --> 01:05:27,789
But you were saying...
About your bike?

618
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:32,861
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

619
01:05:32,863 --> 01:05:35,330
It's just, uh...
It's over there.

620
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:40,101
Um...

621
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:44,372
You see, I'm sort of, um,

622
01:05:44,374 --> 01:05:47,542
enclosed here.

623
01:05:47,544 --> 01:05:51,212
But maybe you could
go on your bike

624
01:05:51,214 --> 01:05:53,815
and get someone for me?

625
01:05:53,817 --> 01:05:56,484
Get someone for you?

626
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:59,721
I-I-I don't do errands.

627
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:03,391
See, I'm bigger than errands.

628
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:07,662
Now, If you want a ride,

629
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:09,664
If you want to...

630
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:13,335
If you want to give our
minds the chance to fuse,

631
01:06:13,337 --> 01:06:16,037
I'll take you anywhere
you've got to go.

632
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,478
So, what do you say?

633
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:31,019
Ah, so.

634
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:36,524
Come here.

635
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:42,530
You're so fucking slow.

636
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:45,100
If she got picked up,
we'd have heard by now.

637
01:06:45,102 --> 01:06:48,636
She's out here. Somewhere.

638
01:06:48,638 --> 01:06:51,506
<i>- Give it just a little</i>
<i>- More time, okay?</i>

639
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:54,976
<i>Then get braids to the house.</i>
<i>She's our focus.</i>

640
01:06:54,978 --> 01:06:57,345
Right.

641
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:59,981
Listen, once braids pays off

642
01:06:59,983 --> 01:07:02,224
and we get some cash, why don't
you get that cough fixed?

643
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:06,654
<i>Hey, I wouldn't wish valley
fever on a desert rat.</i>

644
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:10,291
You've got it.

645
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,300
Where are you, little girl?

646
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:24,873
Aldous huxley...

647
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:28,309
I don't care what anyone Says.
I don't care what Evie said.

648
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:31,713
He was the absolute shit.
I mean, check it out.

649
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:34,582
On his deathbed,
dude's dying of, like,

650
01:07:34,584 --> 01:07:37,552
cancer or scurvy or
something, he asked for

651
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:40,021
the single greatest hit of LSD

652
01:07:40,023 --> 01:07:42,924
ever administered to
a single human being.

653
01:07:42,926 --> 01:07:44,926
Ever. No shit. True story.

654
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:50,265
I could, you know, If you want,

655
01:07:50,267 --> 01:07:53,468
sometime I could... I could
read you some huxley.

656
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:01,076
Check it out. Raven.

657
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:06,681
Raven.

658
01:08:06,683 --> 01:08:08,683
Uh, mister?

659
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:13,354
I'm in a really big hurry.

660
01:08:13,356 --> 01:08:16,858
I've got, like, a really
big, major emergency.

661
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:20,395
Ah.

662
01:08:20,397 --> 01:08:22,430
I know.

663
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:12,413
Stay right there!

664
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,621
I'll shoot! I will!

665
01:09:19,623 --> 01:09:21,990
Move one inch, and you're dead!

666
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:32,133
What do you want me to do?

667
01:09:32,135 --> 01:09:34,669
Just tell me what to do!

668
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:59,194
Um, mister?

669
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:01,563
We're really running
out of time here.

670
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:04,132
I know. My mother... please,

671
01:10:04,134 --> 01:10:06,668
we can't waste one more second.

672
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,336
I know. I know.

673
01:10:08,338 --> 01:10:11,139
I'm helping you. I'm generous.

674
01:10:11,141 --> 01:10:13,141
You should know that about me.

675
01:10:13,143 --> 01:10:15,143
If we're gonna, you know...

676
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:20,215
Please,

677
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:24,419
your bike... where is it?

678
01:10:24,421 --> 01:10:26,387
Right here.

679
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:32,260
What?

680
01:10:32,262 --> 01:10:34,796
Right... here.

681
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:41,169
Wh-what is that?

682
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:43,738
Triumph bonneville 750.

683
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:48,042
That's your bike?

684
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:51,713
Well, when I stopped, I gave her
a little going-over, you know?

685
01:10:51,715 --> 01:10:55,650
Some minds, they just...
They won't be contained.

686
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:00,688
What? I can put her
back together.

687
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:02,690
I took her apart, yeah?

688
01:11:02,692 --> 01:11:04,792
So I can put her
back together, easy.

689
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:12,600
Wait. Just wait, okay?

690
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:17,071
I'm... I'm helping you.

691
01:11:17,073 --> 01:11:20,975
I'm a big person.
A thinker. Huh?

692
01:11:20,977 --> 01:11:24,145
Why the fuck are you pulling
this shit on me anyway? Huh?

693
01:11:24,147 --> 01:11:26,981
What the fuck, huh?

694
01:11:26,983 --> 01:11:30,118
Oh, now I get it.

695
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,221
Right. Donny put you
up to this.

696
01:11:33,223 --> 01:11:34,822
Huh?

697
01:11:34,824 --> 01:11:36,958
What?

698
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,662
Donny Benji,
Evie's fat-fuck brother.

699
01:11:40,664 --> 01:11:43,231
What are you talking about?
Listen.

700
01:11:43,233 --> 01:11:45,133
Listen.

701
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:47,168
I didn't touch her.

702
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:49,304
Do you people understand?

703
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:52,440
She fell, okay?
She fucking fell.

704
01:11:52,442 --> 01:11:54,942
I never even wanted to
live on the sixth floor.

705
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:57,245
I never wanted
the fucking terrace.

706
01:11:57,247 --> 01:11:59,914
She wanted the fucking terrace
so she could get a fucking tan

707
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:02,016
and look like
Farrah fucking Fawcett,

708
01:12:02,018 --> 01:12:04,952
whoever the fuck that is.

709
01:12:04,954 --> 01:12:06,821
Now, do you get that?

710
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:09,324
Do you fucking get that?

711
01:12:12,629 --> 01:12:14,529
Shut up. Shut...

712
01:12:14,531 --> 01:12:16,764
Shut up. I come out here

713
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:18,599
to get away from
people like you,

714
01:12:18,601 --> 01:12:20,535
people chasing after me
with all this Evie shit.

715
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:28,109
You people think
you can get me?

716
01:12:28,111 --> 01:12:31,279
Well, you can't.
You fucking can't.

717
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:37,385
Fuck!

718
01:12:37,387 --> 01:12:40,455
Fuck! Fuck!

719
01:12:40,457 --> 01:12:43,224
Fuck! Fucking burns!

720
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:57,138
<i>I hit the ball</i>
<i>like an egg, Gracie.</i>

721
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,547
<i>Cut calves. Herds.</i>

722
01:13:39,549 --> 01:13:41,549
<i>What do you mean, cut?</i>

723
01:13:41,551 --> 01:13:43,551
<i>- Not literally,</i>
<i>- Like, with a knife.</i>

724
01:13:45,555 --> 01:13:49,157
<i>But he kept the calves from</i>
<i>going to the other side...</i>

725
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:54,762
<i>But I don't know</i>
<i>If you can ride a horse...</i>

726
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:57,832
<i>I don't know If you</i>
<i>can ride a horse...</i>

727
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:02,637
<i>Well, I think we can get him...</i>

728
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,274
<i>All right, hawkeye.</i>

729
01:14:06,276 --> 01:14:09,110
<i>My wide-ass, excitement.</i>

730
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:11,712
<i>If that's excitement,</i>
<i>I'm playmate of the year.</i>

731
01:14:11,714 --> 01:14:13,781
<i>You mean to tell me</i>

732
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:16,651
<i>you got that kind</i>
<i>of action back in Hoboken?</i>

733
01:14:16,653 --> 01:14:19,987
<i>- "Action"? Actually,</i>
<i>- Yes, we did.</i>

734
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:39,373
We can't just stay
like this, you know.

735
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,514
Then give me your phone.

736
01:14:46,516 --> 01:14:49,350
I told you already,
I don't have one.

737
01:14:49,352 --> 01:14:51,686
Come check for yourself.

738
01:14:51,688 --> 01:14:54,021
My brother has one.

739
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:56,457
He's on his way back, but...

740
01:14:56,459 --> 01:14:58,926
I don't think he's gonna
want to give you anything.

741
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:04,899
Are you okay?

742
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:09,837
You don't look so good.

743
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:13,908
I'm sorry I shot you.

744
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:17,712
I am.

745
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:21,048
But you shouldn't
have laughed like that.

746
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:24,285
At the GPS. You...

747
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,420
You shouldn't have done that.

748
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:30,224
That's it.

749
01:15:30,226 --> 01:15:33,528
That's the one I want
right there. Right there.

750
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:37,365
Baby!

751
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:40,368
Hey, she's up. Mm.

752
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:43,871
Are you okay? You've been
out for a little while.

753
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:46,007
And you're all dinged up.

754
01:15:48,411 --> 01:15:50,478
I was, uh...

755
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,514
I was out with my metal detector
looking for scrap, and...

756
01:15:53,516 --> 01:15:55,416
- "scrap"?
- More like trash,

757
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:57,985
senor scavenger.

758
01:15:57,987 --> 01:16:00,354
Yeah. I heard a scream.

759
01:16:00,356 --> 01:16:03,758
I saw you way over
there on the ground.

760
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:08,596
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa,
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, miss.

761
01:16:08,598 --> 01:16:12,066
Settle back down.

762
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:15,269
Best thing for a concussion,
If that's what you've got

763
01:16:15,271 --> 01:16:17,672
is just to lay back
for a while.

764
01:16:17,674 --> 01:16:20,775
Your smack-head pal's in the trailer
next door with rod's cousin,

765
01:16:20,777 --> 01:16:23,444
rinsing his eyes out.

766
01:16:23,446 --> 01:16:26,247
Please tell me that's
not your boyfriend.

767
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:28,583
No. Seriously, hon,
I don't judge,

768
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:31,552
but you really shouldn't
be using that junk.

769
01:16:31,554 --> 01:16:33,888
You use junk, you meet junk...

770
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:36,724
I was, um, in a van

771
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:40,027
about five or six Miles up,

772
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:43,731
and we were in a terrible...

773
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:45,900
Trouble.

774
01:16:45,902 --> 01:16:47,969
Really, I was...

775
01:16:47,971 --> 01:16:51,439
I was trying to reach
fort defiance.

776
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:53,207
Fort defiance?

777
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:57,478
What?

778
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:00,047
Well, you found it.

779
01:17:00,049 --> 01:17:02,049
Glamorous, eh?

780
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:05,119
Regular wild-west kingdom,

781
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:08,022
with a chariot out back.

782
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:15,563
I don't need a chariot.

783
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:20,167
Just a car.

784
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:40,054
Hon, you okay?

785
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:51,999
Hon, come on.

786
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:08,783
Don't worry, miss.
We made the call.

787
01:18:08,785 --> 01:18:11,452
Cops are on the way.
They should be there soon.

788
01:18:11,454 --> 01:18:14,021
Yeah, they never hear about
any craziness on the Rez.

789
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:17,324
They always just jump right on
their horses and come and save us.

790
01:18:17,326 --> 01:18:19,560
Especially with hustler rod.

791
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:25,299
Can you, uh...

792
01:18:25,301 --> 01:18:27,535
Can you close the windows?

793
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:29,303
Please?

794
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:34,308
They're closed, hon.

795
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:39,346
It's okay, miss.

796
01:18:39,348 --> 01:18:42,750
The sky's our friend,

797
01:18:42,752 --> 01:18:45,386
and the sand is our friend too.

798
01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:51,726
And man? I don't know
If man is our friend.

799
01:18:51,728 --> 01:18:54,061
- Don't listen to him.
- Listen to me.

800
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:56,497
You're gonna be all right, hon.

801
01:18:56,499 --> 01:18:59,700
Hell, we even got guns in back.

802
01:18:59,702 --> 01:19:03,370
Rod'll shoot anything for you for a price.
He may not hit it.

803
01:19:03,372 --> 01:19:06,006
You said you were
in a van? White?

804
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:10,211
From the facility?

805
01:19:10,213 --> 01:19:12,513
Well, maybe it was
reincarnated.

806
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:20,855
Pull over! Pull over!
I got to stop them!

807
01:19:23,192 --> 01:19:24,759
Hello?

808
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:29,263
Hello?

809
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:31,198
Be careful.

810
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:42,109
No, we have it here.

811
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:44,745
If you can just check on the officer.
Thank you.

812
01:19:44,747 --> 01:19:46,614
Okay.

813
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:56,891
They're checking with
sergeant Desoto.

814
01:19:56,893 --> 01:19:59,794
Miss, we're gonna have to move.
You understand?

815
01:19:59,796 --> 01:20:02,663
Yeah, maybe I should go with.

816
01:20:02,665 --> 01:20:05,666
I can't allow anybody in the van.
It's protocol.

817
01:20:05,668 --> 01:20:08,235
But you've done more
than enough, believe me.

818
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:12,606
We'll follow,

819
01:20:12,608 --> 01:20:16,443
just to see her
get with her mom.

820
01:20:16,445 --> 01:20:20,915
Hey, rod's not gonna scavenge
the site, I promise.

821
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:26,687
Hey, hon.

822
01:20:26,689 --> 01:20:29,190
You're gonna be all right.

823
01:20:29,192 --> 01:20:31,792
Yeah, we're gonna... excuse me...

824
01:20:31,794 --> 01:20:33,727
we're gonna have to go. Thanks.

825
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,101
Thank you again.

826
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:47,007
Okay, hazel.

827
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:53,480
They just flagged
sergeant Desoto.

828
01:20:53,482 --> 01:20:56,884
I told him his happy hour
would just have to wait.

829
01:20:56,886 --> 01:20:59,520
Two men, you said?

830
01:20:59,522 --> 01:21:02,022
Machine guns and masks?

831
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:06,560
I swear.

832
01:21:06,562 --> 01:21:09,330
Yeah, when you guys didn't show up,
we were thinking it was a flat

833
01:21:09,332 --> 01:21:11,298
or a flight delay

834
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,335
or a panic attack at worst.

835
01:21:14,337 --> 01:21:18,272
Lyle sometimes likes to turn off his
cell phone so we don't bug him.

836
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:23,377
And you're sure he's dead?

837
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:26,046
I saw it.

838
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,154
You know he used to
call me<i> Capitan</i> and<i> jefe</i>

839
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:36,490
like he was joking.

840
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:43,530
Your mother, at least...

841
01:21:43,532 --> 01:21:46,267
You were saying
she was still alive?

842
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:53,340
Well, I...

843
01:21:53,342 --> 01:21:55,442
I left her alive.

844
01:21:57,178 --> 01:21:59,780
It'll be okay, hazel.

845
01:21:59,782 --> 01:22:01,315
It'll be fine.

846
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:13,861
Breathe, hazel.

847
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:33,814
You want something to eat?

848
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:39,787
I have a snack in my pocket.
I could get it for you.

849
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:51,832
Uh, I was just getting a snack.

850
01:22:51,834 --> 01:22:54,001
Me and Jess,
we're not bad guys.

851
01:22:54,003 --> 01:22:57,004
We don't wear black hats.
The opposite, actually.

852
01:22:59,074 --> 01:23:01,375
You know?

853
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:05,446
So like I said,

854
01:23:05,448 --> 01:23:08,515
I'm sorry I shot you.

855
01:23:08,517 --> 01:23:11,618
I really hope that you
don't hold it against me.

856
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:13,887
Okay?

857
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:17,925
Can I ask you something?

858
01:23:17,927 --> 01:23:21,595
Do you? Do you
hold it against me?

859
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:28,502
I'll tell you what.

860
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:34,641
I've been sitting here all day

861
01:23:34,643 --> 01:23:37,845
in my own blood,

862
01:23:37,847 --> 01:23:41,181
flies on me,

863
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:44,018
bullets in me,

864
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:46,720
sharing a van with

865
01:23:46,722 --> 01:23:50,557
three dead people who were
talking to me this morning,

866
01:23:53,128 --> 01:23:57,664
and I haven't for one second
thought about you shooting me.

867
01:23:57,666 --> 01:24:00,134
No joke.

868
01:24:00,136 --> 01:24:02,536
Not one single second.

869
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:08,375
What I have thought about...

870
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:13,881
all I've thought about...

871
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:19,086
is my daughter,

872
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:24,091
who's out there somewhere,

873
01:24:24,093 --> 01:24:27,594
please God, moving okay,

874
01:24:27,596 --> 01:24:30,330
breathing okay.

875
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:41,942
So...

876
01:24:41,944 --> 01:24:45,179
So to address your concern

877
01:24:45,181 --> 01:24:48,415
about what you've done to me,

878
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:50,684
no,

879
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:53,087
I won't hold it against you.

880
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:58,625
But what you've done
to my daughter...

881
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:13,407
what the hell are you doing?

882
01:25:13,409 --> 01:25:15,642
Jesse, she's alive,
and she's got a gun.

883
01:25:15,644 --> 01:25:18,545
Did you take your goddamn meds?

884
01:25:18,547 --> 01:25:20,547
Jess, I did. Front seat.

885
01:25:20,549 --> 01:25:23,717
No one's alive. Front seat!

886
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:26,120
Put that gun down!

887
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:29,756
Drop that gun!

888
01:25:29,758 --> 01:25:32,593
No! Blanks?

889
01:25:32,595 --> 01:25:35,963
Pru, you know I had to.
You put blanks in my gun?

890
01:25:35,965 --> 01:25:39,500
Get out of my way! I can't believe
you'd put blanks in this gun!

891
01:25:39,502 --> 01:25:41,635
What where you thinking?
Goddamn you, get back!

892
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:46,306
Jesus Christ,
I can't believe you did that!

893
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:50,577
Hey!

894
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:53,247
What's going on here? We're
assessing the situation.

895
01:25:53,249 --> 01:25:56,583
No, no, no! Don't listen to him!
Get back in your vehicle.

896
01:25:56,585 --> 01:25:58,485
He's lying! I'm not lying.

897
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:01,255
Hey, mister! Please!
It's Dee, right?

898
01:26:01,257 --> 01:26:03,257
Yes! Yeah, I'm here to help you.

899
01:26:03,259 --> 01:26:06,693
These men aren't! We're in danger!
All right, Dee.

900
01:26:06,695 --> 01:26:09,630
I'm gonna come over
and take a look at you.

901
01:26:09,632 --> 01:26:12,299
Me, not the officer.
He's not an officer!

902
01:26:12,301 --> 01:26:14,201
- Yes, I am.
- Just shoot him!

903
01:26:14,203 --> 01:26:16,270
Dee, just let me help you.

904
01:26:16,272 --> 01:26:19,673
No, I can't! Help me!
Watch that gun!

905
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:22,509
No! No, he's lying!

906
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:25,979
He's lying! Haze?

907
01:26:25,981 --> 01:26:28,182
Get back in the van!
No, no, no! Stop!

908
01:26:28,184 --> 01:26:30,551
You, get back in the van.

909
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:38,158
All right, Dee.
Just let me help you.

910
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:48,001
What we're gonna have to do is
clean this all up. Broom it.

911
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:55,909
No!

912
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:04,384
Oh, God. Oh, God.

913
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:07,888
Rod! Baby! Baby, you okay?

914
01:27:10,825 --> 01:27:12,859
Goddamn, girl,

915
01:27:12,861 --> 01:27:15,562
you're a good shot.

916
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:30,410
I'm s... I'm sorry.

917
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:41,888
- Mom?
- Haze!

918
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:43,757
Ma?

919
01:27:49,364 --> 01:27:51,598
You okay? Uh-huh.

920
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,600
It's okay.

921
01:27:57,639 --> 01:27:59,539
We made it.

922
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:03,677
You made it.

923
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:08,682
You were with me the whole way.

924
01:28:12,754 --> 01:28:14,621
I'm sorry.

925
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:18,525
I'm so sorry.

926
01:28:24,733 --> 01:28:27,501
It's okay. It's okay.

927
01:28:32,073 --> 01:28:34,007
It's okay.

928
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:37,811
It's a start.

929
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:39,746
Right?

930
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:43,517
Yeah.

931
01:28:43,519 --> 01:28:46,219
Yeah, It's a start.

932
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:54,761
Okay. It's okay.

933
01:28:54,763 --> 01:28:57,597
It's okay? Are you sure?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

934
01:28:57,599 --> 01:28:59,366
Okay.

935
01:29:08,609 --> 01:29:10,844
It's okay. It's okay.

936
01:29:12,714 --> 01:29:14,748
I'm not gonna hurt you.

937
01:29:43,745 --> 01:29:46,813
Are you okay?
Are you hurt anywhere?

938
01:29:55,924 --> 01:29:57,924
Stay here.
