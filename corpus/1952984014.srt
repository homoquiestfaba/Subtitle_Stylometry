1
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:17,524
–Mom?
–I am here.

2
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:28,241
Mom!

3
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:35,695
You forgot that.

4
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:39,013
Are you sure
this is the right thing?

5
00:01:39,053 --> 00:01:42,007
It feels like it'd be better
if we thought about it.

6
00:01:43,373 --> 00:01:47,607
–Yeah, I do.
–We don't have any other option.

7
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:51,119
Okay.

8
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:02,837
If I get off early
I can pick you up.

9
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:04,963
It don't matter,
I will take a bus.

10
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:07,538
Don't worry.

11
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:11,089
–Have a good day.
–You too, Mom.

12
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:30,735
–How you doing?
–I don't know.

13
00:02:32,877 --> 00:02:34,994
How we're paying
for all of this?

14
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:39,376
–We put up the house.
–I knew it.

15
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:43,768
It's because of you
I am still alive.

16
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:47,221
We decided it together.

17
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:50,193
What did you all
decide together?

18
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:53,073
To live on the street?

19
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:56,184
For 18 years…

20
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:59,957
your mother and I have been
paying on that house…

21
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:03,254
just to fuck it all up.

22
00:03:03,981 --> 00:03:05,880
Don't say that, Dad.

23
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:22,901
I am leaving, babe.

24
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:25,189
You got what
you have been waiting for?

25
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:26,229
Yeah, I got it.

26
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:28,051
Would it be right?

27
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:30,228
That's not your concern.

28
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:34,293
But if I make it back,
I going to make so much money…

29
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:36,821
you going to love me again.

30
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:14,894
When I turned five years old,
I got a little kitten.

31
00:05:14,957 --> 00:05:17,829
It was so cute I took
it to bed with me every night.

32
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:19,161
I want a little lamb…

33
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:21,573
and I will take it to bed
with me at night.

34
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,893
People don't keep sheep inside.

35
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,869
–I will.
–Didn't you hear?

36
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:29,029
We don't keep sheep inside
and we don't take them to bed.

37
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:32,496
My little lamb has to be
all white with black ears.

38
00:05:32,557 --> 00:05:33,976
Why black ears?

39
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,741
So I won't get him mixed up
with the other sheep.

40
00:05:36,781 --> 00:05:39,280
I will be able to recognize him.

41
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:40,400
Very clever.

42
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:43,117
Thanks, Mom.

43
00:06:09,645 --> 00:06:11,445
Two million dollars, Jasper.

44
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:13,367
I get back $3 million in 3 days.

45
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:17,304
You said $2.5.

46
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:28,495
–I'll take it.
–You can count it.

47
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:49,553
I'm sorry to say, but
he'll need another operation.

48
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:52,502
Unfortunately
we can't always foresee…

49
00:06:52,558 --> 00:06:54,565
consequences
in this type of cases.

50
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:57,071
How much is this operation
gonna cost?

51
00:06:57,133 --> 00:07:00,035
I assume it would be so much
as the past procedure.

52
00:07:03,085 --> 00:07:04,209
All right.

53
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:06,665
Thank you Doctor.

54
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:32,087
So what's thisjob about, man?
Dope?

55
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:33,811
No. Nothing like that.

56
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:36,597
Listen, I am broke.
I am on the street.

57
00:07:37,997 --> 00:07:38,997
Hey.

58
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,887
I haven't forgotten what you did
for me when I was away.

59
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:47,858
If this thing works out.
I will set you up. I promise.

60
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:51,507
–How long exactly will it take?
–One day.

61
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:55,379
Jesus. You make
all that cash in one day?

62
00:07:55,437 --> 00:07:56,496
If I make it.

63
00:07:57,741 --> 00:07:59,501
But you made it the last time.

64
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:02,196
That was last time.

65
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:07,414
As long as my luck doesn't
run out, you can count on me.

66
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:36,622
Do you still live at 135,
Kissam Avenue, Talbot Ohio?

67
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:38,127
Yeah.

68
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:49,107
Okay Vincent, I think
that about does it. Thank you.

69
00:11:07,469 --> 00:11:10,797
I'm here to pick up a package
for William Harrison.

70
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:13,999
–ID please.
–Sure.

71
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:57,814
There is a train ticket
for New York…

72
00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:01,911
and the CPS receipt
for pick-up.

73
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:04,421
We know
about the envelope…

74
00:12:04,461 --> 00:12:06,373
we opened it
before your husband.

75
00:12:06,413 --> 00:12:07,413
And?

76
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,443
There was no CPS receipt
in the envelope.

77
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:15,309
That's your problem.
I got enough for my own.

78
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:18,479
Okay.

79
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:21,207
Thank you.

80
00:12:22,349 --> 00:12:23,349
Thank you.

81
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:30,197
Here it is. Harrison.
Picked up by Al Vincent Farrow.

82
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:39,700
Yeah, it's him.

83
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:50,806
What do you think?
How do I look?

84
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:53,304
You're very handsome.

85
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:55,790
They're gonna love you.

86
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:12,436
<i>–Hello?
–Mr Harrison?</i>

87
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:13,493
Yeah.

88
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:16,403
<i>Tomorrow at noon…</i>

89
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:18,757
<i>go to the PostNet store
by Grand Central.</i>

90
00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:22,071
<i>–Hang on.
–200 West, 39th Street.</i>

91
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:24,272
Okay.

92
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:27,415
<i>With the key you found
with the cell phone…</i>

93
00:14:27,469 --> 00:14:28,909
<i>you'll open box 253.</i>

94
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:32,785
<i>Inside you'll find another train
ticket and more instructions.</i>

95
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:40,046
<i>The ticket is for Macomb, but
you'll get off one stop before.</i>

96
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:42,128
<i>One stop before.</i>

97
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,502
Ticket, please.

98
00:15:46,477 --> 00:15:48,309
He's getting off at Macomb.

99
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:53,105
–What time do we arrive?
–Train gets in at 3:10.

100
00:15:54,573 --> 00:15:56,591
Can I help you
with anything else?

101
00:15:56,973 --> 00:15:58,479
No. Thank you.

102
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:22,965
–You free?
–Yeah, get in.

103
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:45,807
That'll be $77.

104
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:49,557
–Keep the change.
–Wow! Thank you.

105
00:17:47,821 --> 00:17:49,294
Give me your phone.

106
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:56,401
Get in the car.

107
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:43,311
I brought him down here
and that's it. And I left.

108
00:18:46,061 --> 00:18:48,133
You didn't see
anything else unusual?

109
00:18:48,173 --> 00:18:49,173
No.

110
00:19:06,765 --> 00:19:09,558
–Which number is he?
–Thirteen.

111
00:19:21,581 --> 00:19:23,567
Stay in the middle
of the carpet.

112
00:19:27,341 --> 00:19:29,011
Take your clothes off.

113
00:19:41,325 --> 00:19:42,678
Take off the rest.

114
00:19:52,301 --> 00:19:53,774
Get dressed.

115
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:30,254
Follow me.

116
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,026
Have a seat.

117
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:12,432
Who's that?

118
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:14,710
I can explain.

119
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:16,847
–I know…
–Shut up!

120
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:20,150
Go get Jack.

121
00:21:28,717 --> 00:21:30,269
You're probably wondering…

122
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:32,632
what I'm doing here.
–Quiet!

123
00:22:02,893 --> 00:22:04,311
Two million.

124
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:08,023
I'll bet $700·000 on number six.

125
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,096
What's going on?

126
00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:12,403
Who is he?

127
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:15,091
The guy I picked up
at the intersection.

128
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:17,048
He's not who I was expecting.

129
00:22:17,645 --> 00:22:20,558
–Well, he had the number.
–Harrison's dead.

130
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:24,401
–What are you talking about?
–He OD'd.

131
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:27,191
And who the fuck are you?

132
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:32,495
I'm an electrician.
I was working on his house.

133
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:38,917
–Did he tell you about this?
–No, I overheard him talking.

134
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:42,417
He was waiting for a letter
and it could be a lot of money.

135
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:44,807
I took it
and followed the instructions.

136
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:48,402
–Do you know what this is about?
–No.

137
00:22:49,005 --> 00:22:50,576
No, I have no idea.

138
00:22:56,013 --> 00:22:57,202
Follow me.

139
00:23:01,805 --> 00:23:03,637
Do you think the cops sent him?

140
00:23:06,445 --> 00:23:09,075
Maybe we should get out now.

141
00:23:09,645 --> 00:23:11,794
If we leave
and the cops show up…

142
00:23:11,853 --> 00:23:14,286
the others will think
we ratted.

143
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:16,142
We'd be dead men.

144
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,293
–Where you going?
–I should go talk to them.

145
00:23:26,061 --> 00:23:28,526
Excuse me, gentlemen.

146
00:23:29,581 --> 00:23:31,414
If it's a problem…

147
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:33,911
me being here, then…

148
00:23:33,965 --> 00:23:36,660
then I think I should leave.
I'll leave.

149
00:23:36,718 --> 00:23:38,355
It's too late.

150
00:23:42,445 --> 00:23:45,326
–Where are they?
–They're in there.

151
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:50,254
Is your man here?

152
00:23:50,317 --> 00:23:52,881
Yes, he's here.
Everything's okay.

153
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:54,610
We start in a half hour.

154
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:56,757
We'll be right down.

155
00:24:00,781 --> 00:24:04,589
–What if I don't want me here?
–You have to play now.

156
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:07,854
I don't know
what that means, but…

157
00:24:08,493 --> 00:24:10,032
You'll find out.

158
00:24:12,877 --> 00:24:16,205
Six hundred thousand
on number thirteen.

159
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:23,352
Good luck.

160
00:25:04,813 --> 00:25:07,923
Attention! The first round
is about to begin!

161
00:25:08,653 --> 00:25:09,744
You can have it.

162
00:25:09,805 --> 00:25:13,427
I'm asking the guards to
please distribute the bullets.

163
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:16,366
One bullet to each player.

164
00:25:21,773 --> 00:25:22,962
Hans…

165
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:29,008
we are born only once
and we die only once.

166
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:32,756
You must be philosophical, huh?

167
00:25:32,813 --> 00:25:37,135
You are the descendant
of the great Schopenhauer.

168
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:07,928
I ask all the gamblers
To back up a little.

169
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:13,039
Please, gentlemen, back up.
Back up.

170
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,520
Thank you gentlemen.

171
00:26:24,173 --> 00:26:27,032
Please, boss, have a seat.

172
00:26:28,813 --> 00:26:30,253
Players!

173
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:35,924
Load your bullets
into their cylinders!

174
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:48,056
What going on, thirteen?

175
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:51,023
Do you have a problem,
number thirteen?

176
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:54,981
Watch out.

177
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:57,400
No, no one get up into the ring!

178
00:26:57,453 --> 00:26:59,537
I ask you to step down
immediately!

179
00:26:59,597 --> 00:27:02,510
He doesn't know how
to load his gun. Give it here.

180
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:06,485
Pay attention.
Open it like this.

181
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:08,149
Round.

182
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:15,381
All right! Enough!

183
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:22,095
Take your places!

184
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:27,959
Raise your weapons!

185
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:34,324
Higher!

186
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:39,191
Spin your cylinders!

187
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:43,764
More, more, keep it up!

188
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:51,858
Stop!

189
00:27:54,221 --> 00:27:55,542
Aim!

190
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:02,101
Cock your hammers!

191
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:10,030
Number thirteen,
no turning around!

192
00:28:13,997 --> 00:28:17,718
Players, all eyes on the bulb!

193
00:28:17,773 --> 00:28:21,559
When the bulb lights up,
you shoot!

194
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:14,415
Number thirteen did not shoot!

195
00:29:14,925 --> 00:29:18,646
Mr Joe Gerber, if your man
does not shoot, we will!

196
00:29:22,925 --> 00:29:26,252
What the fuck are you doing?
Pull the trigger!

197
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:32,056
–Shoot! Shoot, son of a bitch!
–I'm going to count to three!

198
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:34,292
–Shoot!
–Shoot!

199
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:35,407
Two!

200
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:48,592
Everyone out of the ring!

201
00:29:53,773 --> 00:29:56,086
Are you done
with your little drama?

202
00:30:02,765 --> 00:30:05,624
How much are they paying you
to watch my ass?

203
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:08,145
What the fuck is it to you?

204
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:11,566
I'll give you fifty times more
what they're giving you…

205
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:13,681
if you let me
get out of here.

206
00:30:13,741 --> 00:30:16,622
If you got that money,
why did you come here?

207
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:21,934
Do you think I waltzed
through the fucking door?

208
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:50,453
–What's going on, man?
–Get dressed, fucker!

209
00:30:58,637 --> 00:31:01,496
<i>Gringo, gringo.
Where are you going, gringo?</i>

210
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:17,008
Hi, boss. Very nice to see you.

211
00:31:17,677 --> 00:31:20,055
It must be really important…

212
00:31:20,717 --> 00:31:22,932
ifyou want to talk
this late.

213
00:31:24,557 --> 00:31:25,811
Put him in the box.

214
00:31:26,158 --> 00:31:29,649
Wait. What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

215
00:31:32,941 --> 00:31:38,222
Damn it! Get me the fuck
outta here! God damn!

216
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:55,502
Unshackle his legs.

217
00:31:58,189 --> 00:31:59,585
Are you in charge here?

218
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:01,647
You gonna tell me
what's going on?

219
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:05,648
I've been in this goddamn box
for two and a half days!

220
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:07,793
What's going on.
What do you want?

221
00:32:07,853 --> 00:32:11,410
Give him a shower, a change
of clothes. Something fresh.

222
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:12,528
What are you…?

223
00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:15,187
–And his stuff?
–What are you talking about?

224
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:17,906
Give it to him.

225
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:23,730
I can't do nothing foryou,
don't even think about it.

226
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:26,135
–It's not possible.
–Wait a minute.

227
00:32:26,189 --> 00:32:28,786
Come on, come here.
Come here, man.

228
00:32:40,365 --> 00:32:43,409
My man is out.
I wanna bet on yours.

229
00:32:43,469 --> 00:32:46,677
Sure. I take
50 points off the top.

230
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:53,617
–You want some morphine?
–No.

231
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:56,849
–They all do it.
–I said no!

232
00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:07,346
You lost your player,
didn't you?

233
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:08,405
Son of a bitch.

234
00:33:08,461 --> 00:33:10,742
Sure you're betting
on the right man?

235
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:13,591
Don't worry about him,
he has what he needs.

236
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:17,381
I don't know what you deal
with this guy is, but…

237
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:19,505
I can do you one better.
60/40.

238
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:21,846
Sixty for you,
forty for me.

239
00:33:21,901 --> 00:33:24,596
But you have to bet
at least $400·000.

240
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:27,348
The player number six
has the most experience.

241
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:30,411
–You know who I'm talking about?
–I know your player.

242
00:33:30,445 --> 00:33:33,272
You made your offer,
I just made mine.

243
00:33:33,325 --> 00:33:35,704
Let this gentleman
make up his own mind.

244
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:39,701
Sixty-forty it is.

245
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:44,373
Place your bets, gentlemen.

246
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:19,829
Your brother would fare better
if family visited more often.

247
00:34:19,885 --> 00:34:22,744
A year's a long time
for someone in his condition.

248
00:34:22,798 --> 00:34:25,143
I'm the only family
Ronald Lynn has.

249
00:34:25,965 --> 00:34:28,464
I try to get down here
as often as I can.

250
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:31,351
To skip his medication,
even for a day…

251
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:34,199
could be serious.
–Yes, ma'am.

252
00:34:37,997 --> 00:34:41,390
Sign here and here
for Ronald Lynn's release.

253
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,354
Your brother's here. He came
to get you. You have to go.

254
00:35:08,685 --> 00:35:10,868
–Did they take care of you?
–Yeah.

255
00:35:12,525 --> 00:35:14,609
–Good.
–This is your new car?

256
00:35:15,437 --> 00:35:17,008
Yeah. You like it?

257
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:21,392
–Yeah.
–Come on, let's go.

258
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:35,052
On your feet!

259
00:35:35,053 --> 00:35:37,814
Move it! Let's go!

260
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:39,761
Now!

261
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:44,752
I said move it! Let's go!

262
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:49,879
Get him on his feet, now!
You! Get him on his feet!

263
00:35:50,861 --> 00:35:54,932
On your feet, gentlemen!
On your feet!

264
00:35:56,557 --> 00:36:00,944
Two bullets in each weapon!
Two bullets!

265
00:36:01,005 --> 00:36:06,199
Players, load your bullets
into their cylinders!

266
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:22,168
Two bullets!

267
00:36:23,437 --> 00:36:24,692
Higher!

268
00:36:28,173 --> 00:36:30,192
Spin your cylinders!

269
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:37,106
Keep it up!

270
00:36:40,173 --> 00:36:41,330
Stop!

271
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:47,375
Aim!

272
00:36:48,813 --> 00:36:50,800
Cock your hammers!

273
00:36:54,765 --> 00:36:57,078
Don't look me in the eye.

274
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:47,286
–Damn!
–Out of the ring!

275
00:37:47,885 --> 00:37:50,318
Collect the weapons! Now!

276
00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:18,226
You're pretty lucky.

277
00:38:18,285 --> 00:38:21,603
The bullet is in the chamber,
he didn't have time to shoot.

278
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:27,508
Nice. One more round
like that and we're through.

279
00:38:40,045 --> 00:38:41,299
Hans.

280
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:43,697
Hans.

281
00:38:45,805 --> 00:38:47,442
Bring him to me.

282
00:39:16,365 --> 00:39:18,165
Doctor to the ring!

283
00:39:31,821 --> 00:39:33,807
He cannot continue.

284
00:39:36,269 --> 00:39:40,142
Hold on! Is this a fucking
game or a slaughterhouse?

285
00:39:40,205 --> 00:39:43,532
My player didn't die
in the game. He's still alive.

286
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:49,649
–What the hell was that?
–You know the rules, Mr Taylor.

287
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,439
Hans.

288
00:39:56,621 --> 00:39:58,291
Hans.

289
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:03,128
When you start something, you
must stay with it until the end.

290
00:40:04,141 --> 00:40:06,935
Nobody forced you to do this.

291
00:40:09,421 --> 00:40:11,604
You are two for two.

292
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:17,077
You are great. You are great!

293
00:40:27,021 --> 00:40:28,145
Listen.

294
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:34,866
About two years ago,
me and my boys, we hit this…

295
00:40:34,925 --> 00:40:36,725
armored car in Mexico.

296
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:39,663
My two partners,
they got blown away.

297
00:40:39,725 --> 00:40:43,762
Had time to get rid of the truck
and hid the money.

298
00:40:43,821 --> 00:40:46,437
If you had that money,
why are you out of prison?

299
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,807
You should've been
a gold mine for them.

300
00:40:51,277 --> 00:40:52,532
Damn.

301
00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:55,953
I didn't talk, okay?

302
00:40:56,013 --> 00:40:58,821
If I would've talked,
they would've smoked my ass…

303
00:40:58,861 --> 00:41:00,781
and take the goddamn money.

304
00:41:00,845 --> 00:41:04,172
They'll blow both our brains out
before we got out.

305
00:41:04,237 --> 00:41:07,035
You got a better chance
of surviving in the ring.

306
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:11,217
I got a lot of fucking money.

307
00:41:14,093 --> 00:41:16,276
I'm sorry,
I can't do that for you.

308
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,846
Give me something to write with.

309
00:42:21,389 --> 00:42:23,637
–You sleep okay?
–Yeah.

310
00:42:24,013 --> 00:42:27,919
–I feel much better now.
–Did you take your medication?

311
00:42:28,301 --> 00:42:29,425
No.

312
00:42:32,365 --> 00:42:35,191
Doctor says you're not
supposed to skip a dose.

313
00:42:35,245 --> 00:42:38,867
Fuck her. I feel much better
without it anyway.

314
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:46,655
Tails. Always fucking tails,
you know.

315
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:48,239
My luck's fucked.

316
00:42:49,645 --> 00:42:53,999
No, we're gonna make it. Don't
pay attention to that shit.

317
00:43:01,709 --> 00:43:04,195
How much did we win
for the first 2 rounds?

318
00:43:09,549 --> 00:43:11,284
$2.9 million.

319
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:20,593
We'll be standing behind
player 13.

320
00:43:23,949 --> 00:43:25,869
I'd like to bet the $2.9…

321
00:43:25,933 --> 00:43:27,603
plus an additional $1.2.

322
00:43:46,573 --> 00:43:48,591
I hate that fucking number.

323
00:44:06,669 --> 00:44:07,924
Calm down.

324
00:44:08,525 --> 00:44:11,406
–Just let it go.
–Calm down a little bit.

325
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:14,421
Forget about it.

326
00:44:20,205 --> 00:44:21,646
He's shot two already.

327
00:44:21,709 --> 00:44:23,892
He shoots three,
you get a bonus.

328
00:44:23,949 --> 00:44:25,848
That would be wonderful.

329
00:44:26,285 --> 00:44:29,231
–How much do I have?
–$1.1 million.

330
00:44:38,285 --> 00:44:39,703
Listen, man.

331
00:44:40,877 --> 00:44:42,994
I got all the details…

332
00:44:43,053 --> 00:44:46,097
of where I buried the money
on this map here.

333
00:44:46,925 --> 00:44:48,431
Listen to me, man.

334
00:44:49,101 --> 00:44:52,691
I got a son.
He's doing some time.

335
00:44:52,749 --> 00:44:56,274
He's got another, I don't
know, 18 months to go, so…

336
00:44:57,581 --> 00:44:59,698
if anything happens to me…

337
00:45:00,045 --> 00:45:01,959
and I don't make it
out of here…

338
00:45:02,605 --> 00:45:05,202
I want you to take this note
outta my pocket…

339
00:45:05,261 --> 00:45:08,022
go get that money
and split it with him.

340
00:45:08,397 --> 00:45:09,935
We got a deal?

341
00:45:11,821 --> 00:45:13,392
Okay, you got it.

342
00:45:28,397 --> 00:45:30,197
Number six.

343
00:45:44,461 --> 00:45:46,414
Number three.

344
00:46:02,957 --> 00:46:04,146
Eleven.

345
00:46:19,981 --> 00:46:21,552
You can take him now.

346
00:46:32,717 --> 00:46:34,452
You're going down.

347
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:37,328
What the fuck do you want?

348
00:46:40,078 --> 00:46:41,682
All right, enough!

349
00:46:54,093 --> 00:46:58,414
Mr Schlondoff, why isn't
your player in the ring?

350
00:46:58,477 --> 00:47:02,318
–He must step up immediately!
–He'll be there, he'll be there.

351
00:47:02,381 --> 00:47:04,498
The third round
is about to begin!

352
00:47:04,557 --> 00:47:05,509
What's wrong?

353
00:47:05,549 --> 00:47:08,789
Just a little case of the runs.

354
00:47:08,845 --> 00:47:10,482
Get him up there.

355
00:47:12,365 --> 00:47:13,365
Come on.

356
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:23,569
Give him his gun.

357
00:47:32,525 --> 00:47:34,870
For the third round…

358
00:47:35,309 --> 00:47:38,549
I will ask the guards
to distribute…

359
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:44,083
three bullets to each player.
Three bullets!

360
00:48:01,709 --> 00:48:03,280
Sir, please.

361
00:48:04,013 --> 00:48:06,213
Can I please have
a chair for my player?

362
00:48:06,253 --> 00:48:07,988
He's not feeling too well.

363
00:48:10,669 --> 00:48:12,869
The guy wants a chair
for number three.

364
00:48:12,909 --> 00:48:14,875
He's having
a hard time standing.

365
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:15,957
Get him a chair.

366
00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:29,044
Thank you.

367
00:48:43,469 --> 00:48:45,301
Raise your weapons!

368
00:48:48,365 --> 00:48:50,318
Spin your cylinders!

369
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:56,757
More!

370
00:48:58,605 --> 00:48:59,762
Stop!

371
00:49:02,445 --> 00:49:03,700
Aim!

372
00:49:09,421 --> 00:49:11,288
Cock your hammers!

373
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:19,604
Eyes on the bulb!

374
00:49:49,485 --> 00:49:51,024
Out of the ring!

375
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,205
Collect the weapons!

376
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:11,415
Gentlemen, we are at the last
stage of our game.

377
00:50:11,469 --> 00:50:16,020
The duel. On the table
there are five balls.

378
00:50:16,078 --> 00:50:18,805
Three white, two black.

379
00:50:18,861 --> 00:50:23,247
The black will designate
the duelists.

380
00:50:24,045 --> 00:50:27,373
I will call the gamblers
representing numbers six…

381
00:50:27,437 --> 00:50:32,271
nine, thirteen,
seventeen and three.

382
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:42,262
I will ask that
you unwrap the balls…

383
00:50:42,317 --> 00:50:45,939
above your heads
so that everyone can see.

384
00:50:45,997 --> 00:50:48,758
Gentlemen, good luck.

385
00:51:13,581 --> 00:51:17,967
–Gentlemen, place your bets.
–Okay, wait, wait!

386
00:51:19,245 --> 00:51:22,453
I'm not accepting any offers
under eighty-five percent.

387
00:51:22,509 --> 00:51:24,342
Nothing less than $300·000.

388
00:51:25,613 --> 00:51:27,413
Two million dollars.

389
00:51:28,078 --> 00:51:30,096
Okay, slowly, slowly.

390
00:51:32,941 --> 00:51:35,090
Hey, the game is over for you.

391
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:38,422
You're selected for the draw.

392
00:51:39,437 --> 00:51:41,008
You mean I can go?

393
00:51:41,677 --> 00:51:44,241
Nobody leaves
until the game is over.

394
00:51:44,621 --> 00:51:46,192
After the duel.

395
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,819
Collect your money
and you're free to go.

396
00:51:51,757 --> 00:51:55,118
–They will pay me money?
–Yeah.

397
00:51:56,269 --> 00:51:57,907
Mr Gerber.

398
00:51:59,758 --> 00:52:02,551
I would like to bet on your boy.

399
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:04,822
Our player has no experience…

400
00:52:04,877 --> 00:52:07,311
at this stage of the game,
it's important.

401
00:52:07,693 --> 00:52:11,348
–How much do you want?
–I want eighty percent.

402
00:52:11,917 --> 00:52:14,416
No, no, no, that's too much.

403
00:52:14,477 --> 00:52:17,204
The two brothers are not
offering much better.

404
00:52:17,581 --> 00:52:20,691
We're a long shot at 5 to 1.
You'd make more money.

405
00:52:20,749 --> 00:52:22,484
Everyone is betting on them.

406
00:52:23,693 --> 00:52:24,785
Yes.

407
00:52:26,317 --> 00:52:27,736
All right.

408
00:52:28,109 --> 00:52:30,062
We will do business.

409
00:53:05,709 --> 00:53:07,924
Hey! Let him go!

410
00:53:14,669 --> 00:53:19,056
What the fuck are you doing?
Nobody touches the survivors.

411
00:53:20,429 --> 00:53:23,026
–Nobody!
–Fuck.

412
00:53:23,917 --> 00:53:24,976
Hey, man.

413
00:53:25,389 --> 00:53:27,026
You're looking for this?

414
00:53:28,173 --> 00:53:31,217
All that money you thought
you'd be holding on to?

415
00:53:32,365 --> 00:53:33,653
All that money?

416
00:53:33,709 --> 00:53:36,535
Only thing you'd be
holding on to, Jimmy…

417
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:38,291
would have been your dick.

418
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:39,767
Okay, son?

419
00:53:41,005 --> 00:53:43,024
Happy trails, partner.

420
00:53:48,845 --> 00:53:50,765
What's going on between you?

421
00:53:50,829 --> 00:53:53,524
I just want to get
the fuck out of here.

422
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:56,887
Get dressed and come get
your money. You're free to go.

423
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:35,830
<i>Happy trails to you.</i>

424
00:54:40,909 --> 00:54:43,790
<i>Happy trails to you.</i>

425
00:54:51,405 --> 00:54:53,304
It's almost over, Ronald Lynn.

426
00:54:58,285 --> 00:55:00,817
If this works out well,
Jasper…

427
00:55:01,901 --> 00:55:03,953
I want my fucking share.

428
00:55:05,645 --> 00:55:06,671
Of course.

429
00:55:07,725 --> 00:55:10,367
But there's not a lot of people
batting on us.

430
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:13,381
I don't think
we're gonna make much.

431
00:55:13,421 --> 00:55:17,394
Shut your fucking mouth, cunt!
Shut your fucking mouth!

432
00:55:24,397 --> 00:55:26,513
I fucking know you.

433
00:55:29,901 --> 00:55:31,538
I know you.

434
00:55:46,157 --> 00:55:49,747
Mommy and Daddy left you enough
money to look after me.

435
00:55:55,341 --> 00:55:58,353
And you stucked me
in that fucking hospital.

436
00:56:00,397 --> 00:56:02,449
That hospital costs me a lot.

437
00:56:07,021 --> 00:56:08,965
You've earnt more money
out of me…

438
00:56:09,005 --> 00:56:11,951
playing this fucking game
these past years.

439
00:56:13,293 --> 00:56:17,331
–And you're a fucking waster.
–That's horseshit.

440
00:56:17,773 --> 00:56:21,647
I ain't going back to Centerdale
and I want my fucking money.

441
00:56:35,533 --> 00:56:37,006
Against the wall.

442
00:56:42,893 --> 00:56:44,366
Against the wall.

443
00:56:47,597 --> 00:56:49,332
–Shit.
–What?

444
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:52,084
Trigger is too fucking tight.
It's too big.

445
00:56:52,141 --> 00:56:53,811
They're all the same.

446
00:57:04,557 --> 00:57:05,811
Thirteen.

447
00:57:11,213 --> 00:57:12,304
Six.

448
00:57:19,917 --> 00:57:21,041
One.

449
00:57:23,117 --> 00:57:24,144
Two.

450
00:57:26,637 --> 00:57:27,891
Three.

451
00:57:37,293 --> 00:57:39,192
–Good for you?
–Okay.

452
00:57:56,909 --> 00:57:59,342
Players to the center
of the ring!

453
00:58:14,189 --> 00:58:15,891
Raise your weapons!

454
00:58:22,573 --> 00:58:24,373
Spin your cylinders!

455
00:58:32,173 --> 00:58:33,614
Stop!

456
00:58:40,429 --> 00:58:41,586
Aim!

457
00:58:45,709 --> 00:58:47,444
Cock your hammers!

458
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:52,308
Eyes on the bulb!

459
00:59:41,069 --> 00:59:45,303
Attention, gentlemen!
The duel will continue!

460
00:59:45,965 --> 00:59:51,126
I will ask for an additional
bullet in each cylinder!

461
00:59:51,885 --> 00:59:55,191
One, two, three…

462
00:59:55,918 --> 00:59:57,107
four.

463
01:00:02,925 --> 01:00:06,101
One, two three…

464
01:00:07,245 --> 01:00:08,816
fourth bullet.

465
01:00:22,509 --> 01:00:25,303
Players, please step forward!

466
01:00:34,221 --> 01:00:35,956
Raise your weapons!

467
01:00:41,038 --> 01:00:43,253
Spin your cylinders!

468
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:47,092
More!

469
01:00:53,165 --> 01:00:54,419
Stop!

470
01:00:57,901 --> 01:00:59,571
Aim!

471
01:01:01,997 --> 01:01:03,797
Cock your hammers!

472
01:01:08,141 --> 01:01:10,640
When the bulb lights up,
you shoot!

473
01:01:51,277 --> 01:01:54,670
Gentlemen, the game is over!

474
01:01:56,077 --> 01:01:57,299
It's finished!

475
01:02:03,181 --> 01:02:07,087
And the winner
is number thirteen!

476
01:02:09,741 --> 01:02:13,746
Congratulations, thirteen!
Congratulations!

477
01:02:22,413 --> 01:02:25,905
Fuck! Fuck! Fuckers!

478
01:02:41,613 --> 01:02:43,664
Well done, young man.

479
01:02:44,493 --> 01:02:46,130
Well done.

480
01:02:54,797 --> 01:02:56,051
Have a seat.

481
01:03:11,277 --> 01:03:12,718
Six.

482
01:03:13,133 --> 01:03:14,224
Seven.

483
01:03:14,893 --> 01:03:15,893
Eight.

484
01:03:16,558 --> 01:03:17,681
Nine.

485
01:03:18,285 --> 01:03:19,474
Ten.

486
01:03:21,165 --> 01:03:22,965
Congratulations.

487
01:03:23,021 --> 01:03:26,132
One million, eight hundred
and fifty thousand dollars.

488
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:30,449
Do you realize
how lucky you are?

489
01:03:30,509 --> 01:03:33,270
Your opponent won
his last three duels.

490
01:03:48,845 --> 01:03:52,238
–Are you satisfied?
–Yes.

491
01:03:52,301 --> 01:03:54,484
If you want,
we can give you a ride.

492
01:03:55,213 --> 01:03:56,239
Where?

493
01:03:57,293 --> 01:03:58,733
It doesn't matter.

494
01:03:59,213 --> 01:04:02,011
We can drop you off at
the nearest train station…

495
01:04:02,061 --> 01:04:03,567
if you like.
–Yeah.

496
01:04:04,589 --> 01:04:07,075
I'll get my things
and meet you downstairs.

497
01:04:07,853 --> 01:04:09,358
Would you like a drink?

498
01:04:10,509 --> 01:04:11,764
No, thank you.

499
01:05:40,525 --> 01:05:41,714
Couldn't find him.

500
01:05:43,501 --> 01:05:44,789
Get in the car.

501
01:06:07,501 --> 01:06:09,520
Your total is gonna be $38.

502
01:06:12,717 --> 01:06:14,038
Thank you.

503
01:06:38,381 --> 01:06:39,570
Hi.

504
01:06:40,237 --> 01:06:41,269
Officer Steller?

505
01:06:41,293 --> 01:06:44,174
This is Claudio,
the cab driver from yesterday.

506
01:06:44,237 --> 01:06:45,237
Yeah.

507
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:50,125
No, I just saw your guy.
Yeah, at the station.

508
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:52,760
No, he's here now.

509
01:08:15,917 --> 01:08:17,423
That's him right there.

510
01:08:18,157 --> 01:08:20,470
–He's on your side.
–That's your guy.

511
01:08:20,525 --> 01:08:21,998
Blue jacket, seated.

512
01:08:24,718 --> 01:08:27,664
Excuse me, sir.
Come with us please.

513
01:08:39,469 --> 01:08:41,107
You want him uncuffed?

514
01:08:41,933 --> 01:08:43,254
Uncuff him.

515
01:08:51,373 --> 01:08:53,359
Leave us alone. Thank you.

516
01:09:08,301 --> 01:09:10,101
Where did you hide the money?

517
01:09:10,573 --> 01:09:12,695
What the hell
are you talking about?

518
01:09:15,469 --> 01:09:16,560
Sit down.

519
01:09:19,533 --> 01:09:21,520
I said sit down.

520
01:09:30,285 --> 01:09:32,598
You're not under arrest,
Vincent…

521
01:09:32,653 --> 01:09:36,461
and won't be if you tell me
everything that went on there.

522
01:09:39,213 --> 01:09:41,777
–I never made it.
–Don't bullshit me.

523
01:09:42,573 --> 01:09:44,472
I'm telling the truth.

524
01:09:45,069 --> 01:09:46,836
Why did they pick you up…

525
01:09:46,893 --> 01:09:49,206
if they were looking
for Harrison?

526
01:09:50,989 --> 01:09:53,553
The driver didn't know Harrison.

527
01:09:53,613 --> 01:09:56,592
When he pulled up,
I flashed him the signal.

528
01:09:56,653 --> 01:09:58,159
The signal?

529
01:09:58,893 --> 01:10:01,425
A piece of corkboard
with a number.

530
01:10:12,461 --> 01:10:16,083
–Where did he drop you?
–Somewhere in the forest.

531
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:18,350
What happened?

532
01:10:19,565 --> 01:10:22,478
When I got there, two guys
were waiting in a car.

533
01:10:24,525 --> 01:10:26,990
When they saw me,
I knew I was screwed.

534
01:10:27,565 --> 01:10:29,681
I told them
Harrison was dead…

535
01:10:29,741 --> 01:10:32,054
that I was willing
to take his place.

536
01:10:32,109 --> 01:10:33,909
But they didn't go for it.

537
01:10:34,349 --> 01:10:36,848
Either they didn't believe me
or whatever…

538
01:10:36,909 --> 01:10:38,719
but they
didn't want me there.

539
01:10:39,341 --> 01:10:41,261
I saw one of them had a gun.

540
01:10:41,325 --> 01:10:43,922
When he reached for it,
I reacted.

541
01:10:44,525 --> 01:10:48,016
–I ran and just kept running.
–Did they chase you?

542
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,226
They chased me.
They shot at me.

543
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:54,647
But I just kept running.

544
01:10:55,661 --> 01:10:58,356
I ran so hard I lost
the heels of my shoes.

545
01:11:07,981 --> 01:11:11,247
If you saw them again, would you
be able to identify them?

546
01:11:11,821 --> 01:11:12,912
Of course.

547
01:11:14,605 --> 01:11:17,300
Could you take me
to that place in the forest?

548
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,475
I was in a panic.

549
01:11:19,533 --> 01:11:22,709
I'd been running for hours,
it was dark.

550
01:11:22,765 --> 01:11:25,669
How the fuck do you expect me
to remember where I was?

551
01:11:25,709 --> 01:11:27,909
But if we took you
to that intersection…

552
01:11:27,949 --> 01:11:29,811
you'd get
your bearings, right?

553
01:11:32,365 --> 01:11:34,515
The driver blindfolded me.

554
01:11:36,973 --> 01:11:40,432
–You're lying.
–I'm telling the truth.

555
01:11:45,325 --> 01:11:47,158
Put your boots back on.

556
01:12:06,157 --> 01:12:07,543
Can I go now?

557
01:14:11,853 --> 01:14:13,937
Twenty-two dollars, please.

558
01:14:30,445 --> 01:14:32,725
<i>–Mom?
–Vince.</i>

559
01:14:32,781 --> 01:14:35,575
<i>How's Dad? How's everything?</i>

560
01:14:35,629 --> 01:14:38,772
<i>Everything's the same.
He was wondering about you.</i>

561
01:14:38,829 --> 01:14:41,055
What happened?
Did everything go okay?

562
01:14:41,389 --> 01:14:43,875
Listen, Mom, I sent
some money on the mail.

563
01:14:44,173 --> 01:14:45,875
Certified mail.

564
01:14:45,933 --> 01:14:47,887
<i>–Money?
–A lot of money.</i>

565
01:14:47,949 --> 01:14:51,506
If you're not home,
have Clara wait for it, okay?

566
01:14:51,565 --> 01:14:53,943
<i>What do you mean, money?
From where?</i>

567
01:14:53,997 --> 01:14:57,303
I'll explain later, just
make sure somebody's home.

568
01:14:57,358 --> 01:15:00,751
You're scaring me, Vincent.
Are you in trouble?

569
01:15:00,813 --> 01:15:02,417
<i>No, everything's fine.</i>

570
01:15:02,477 --> 01:15:05,456
Just make sure somebody's
home tomorrow, okay?

571
01:15:05,517 --> 01:15:07,863
<i>Vincent, please tell me
what's going on.</i>

572
01:15:07,918 --> 01:15:08,976
I love you.

573
01:16:09,901 --> 01:16:11,287
$18.25.

574
01:16:15,053 --> 01:16:16,658
How much for the lamb?

575
01:16:17,837 --> 01:16:21,394
–It's not for sale.
–I'll give you $100 for it.

576
01:16:21,773 --> 01:16:23,792
–For the lamb?
–Yeah.

577
01:18:23,821 --> 01:18:24,912
It's snowing.

578
01:18:29,197 --> 01:18:30,289
Yeah.

579
01:18:36,557 --> 01:18:37,877
Going far?

580
01:18:39,949 --> 01:18:41,520
I'm going home.

581
01:18:43,533 --> 01:18:44,690
Where?

582
01:18:48,077 --> 01:18:49,233
Ohio.

583
01:19:52,685 --> 01:19:54,583
<i>We put up the house.</i>

584
01:19:55,565 --> 01:19:57,791
<i>It'd be better
if we thought about it.</i>

585
01:19:59,693 --> 01:20:02,705
<i>I'm here to pick up a package
for William Harrison.</i>

586
01:20:05,773 --> 01:20:09,100
<i>I'm sorry to say, but
he'll need another operation.</i>

587
01:20:12,013 --> 01:20:14,083
<i>With all that cash,
you'll love me.</i>

588
01:20:15,885 --> 01:20:19,606
<i>My little lamb has to be
all white with black ears.</i>

589
01:20:22,253 --> 01:20:23,988
<i>You're very handsome.</i>

590
01:20:25,229 --> 01:20:26,702
<i>They're gonna love you.</i>
