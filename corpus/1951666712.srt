NEXT

3
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:58,236
Ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:02:58,271 --> 00:03:01,606
please welcome the man that knows
what your going to do before you do it!

5
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:05,283
The amazing,
Frank Cadillac.

6
00:03:18,811 --> 00:03:21,999
Good evening. Welcome to the
beautiful downtown Las Vegas.

7
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:23,771
How many people here
from the orient?

8
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:25,072
raise your hands.

9
00:03:26,557 --> 00:03:28,533
You, sir...
where are you from?

10
00:03:28,562 --> 00:03:30,247
No, wait... don't tell me.

11
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:33,755
You must have soul.

12
00:03:34,483 --> 00:03:36,534
your a soul man.

13
00:03:36,535 --> 00:03:38,762
Now tell everyone
where are you from?

14
00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:41,063
- Korea.
- how about that, folks?

15
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:43,993
may I assume this charming young lady

16
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:46,794
- is your daughter.
- she is my wife!

17
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:48,295
Of course!

18
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,535
What happens in
Vegas stays in Vegas.

19
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:54,593
- what's your name?
- Yhun-Kihong.

20
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:57,488
would you be kind enough to join
me up on the stage please?

21
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,289
are you serious about
this guy? is this a joke?

22
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:04,319
coming around with some
minds and clowns while were at it

23
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
Yhun-Kihong.

24
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:07,521
what if I told you that that pretty
necklace your wearing

25
00:04:07,522 --> 00:04:08,622
has a broken catch...

26
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:12,008
and on my count of three
, will fall in your drink.

27
00:04:12,273 --> 00:04:14,440
wouldnt that be something?.
wouldnt that just blow your mind?

28
00:04:14,718 --> 00:04:16,698
- Yes.
- wouldnt it blow all your minds!

29
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:19,699
Three, two, one

30
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,000
now.

31
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:25,474
Does anybody say that was spooky?

32
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:28,233
wait a minute, look at your glass.
where did it go?

33
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,914
Yhun-Kihong, why don't you
look inside my pocket?

34
00:04:31,915 --> 00:04:33,815
reach in. dig deep

35
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:38,093
lets have a big hand for Yhun-Kihong.

36
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,959
Well... thats magic folks.
And thats why I'm here.

37
00:04:44,156 --> 00:04:47,332
They probably seen a
lot of those shows.

38
00:04:47,338 --> 00:04:50,598
Mentalists
magicians, illusionists...

39
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:53,710
you will be shocked to know
that sometimes

40
00:04:53,803 --> 00:04:56,512
not often, but sometimes

41
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,221
its the real deal.

42
00:04:58,222 --> 00:05:00,347
masquerding as an act

43
00:05:00,944 --> 00:05:03,038
hidden behind
a few 50 dollar tricks

44
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,439
hiding in plain sight

45
00:05:05,854 --> 00:05:08,147
Because if the magicians
doesnt do that,

46
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:11,872
the alternative is impossible
for others to live with

47
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:16,457
anyway Wednesday nights
the back page doesnt pay very well,

48
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:17,468
so I gamble.

49
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:20,769
But I don't play against other people,
only against the house.

50
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:29,101
so,no mega
Jack Pots,no wash outs

51
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,803
The idea is to go unnoticed.

52
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,100
that way I can keep coming back

53
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,425
I'm not a God.

54
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,675
I can't see everyone's future
only my own.

55
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,976
and only within
2 minutes,

56
00:05:44,686 --> 00:05:46,437
except for when I saw her

57
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:48,006
but we will come back to that

58
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:50,860
there is no pattern to this guy.
he is all over the map.

59
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:53,161
well he's not counting not enough.

60
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,767
Wait a minute.

61
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:59,870
isnt it that two bit magic act from
Las Vegas. Whats his name?

62
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:01,171
Cadillac.

63
00:06:02,264 --> 00:06:03,726
Yes, Frank Cadillac.

64
00:06:04,325 --> 00:06:06,261
is he pulling tricks on us? is that legal?.

65
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:08,442
He cant trick the deck

66
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:11,792
I'm telling you. that little prick
knows whats coming

67
00:06:11,869 --> 00:06:14,207
If he's really knocking a system
why's he not betting more

68
00:06:14,358 --> 00:06:16,722
That will be my second question

69
00:06:17,953 --> 00:06:19,429
look at him.
he is looking at us

70
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:21,768
Its like he can hear us.

71
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:24,448
- What table is that?
- 27.

72
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:27,490
Send security
to table 27!

73
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:31,797
here is a thing about the future...

74
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,848
every time you look at it,

75
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:34,849
It changes.

76
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:40,860
Because you look at it,
and that changes everything else.

77
00:06:45,762 --> 00:06:47,777
Empty the drawer.
Move!

78
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:50,631
drop the gun, now!

79
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:08,420
drop the gun, step back.

80
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:11,421
Its his gun.
He was going to shoot your people.

81
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:13,722
step Back, now.

82
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:16,912
Whats he doing?

83
00:07:16,989 --> 00:07:21,061
Check the doors, elevators, escalators
everywhere, under the staircases, now!

84
00:07:21,362 --> 00:07:22,862
he is going to the Black Jack tables.

85
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:24,363
make it before he goes

86
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,751
hes right next to the ten dollar slot.
aisle 14.

87
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:22,096
there he is behind you!
your left. turn around!

88
00:08:22,138 --> 00:08:25,309
He's right between you.

89
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:32,646
He's in the mensroom!

90
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:03,374
Where the hell is he?

91
00:09:06,057 --> 00:09:08,083
Black shirt,straw hat
, heading towards the exit.

92
00:09:08,084 --> 00:09:09,384
Let's go

93
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:30,415
Call vegas PD

94
00:09:30,618 --> 00:09:33,853
He stole a silver sports car,
plates 5854AS.

95
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:23,048
this guy escaped from
the casino two months ago

96
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,193
what he does has nothing to do with luck

97
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:28,690
its an ability. look at him!
he knows exactly what to do.

98
00:11:28,691 --> 00:11:30,985
Can it explain to me that?

99
00:11:31,002 --> 00:11:33,772
I cannot explain, Kelly.
nor do I have the time.

100
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:37,088
The Russian Federation has a 10 kiloton
nuclear munition unaccounted for

101
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,451
I understand that

102
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:41,452
I'm not sure you do.

103
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:44,453
We need every
agent available beating the street.

104
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,454
that bomb was stolen
5 weeks ago ago.

105
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,455
We have just been informed of it now.

106
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:50,456
which means it could just be parked
under this truck for all we know

107
00:11:50,457 --> 00:11:53,457
any actionable intelligence

108
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,958
Not paranormal
and bullshit magicians.

109
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:57,959
With all due respect
sir, this bullshit magician

110
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
advanced the way he did

111
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:02,400
its statiscally impossible.
let me bring him in

112
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:03,701
then get what you want.

113
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:08,567
5 days, Kelly.
thats it.

114
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:15,070
get me the head of casino security

115
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:22,415
You Roybal?

116
00:12:22,716 --> 00:12:24,270
whatever.
- Who are you?

117
00:12:24,471 --> 00:12:26,828
Cavanaugh, take a walk

118
00:12:28,518 --> 00:12:31,856
hey roybal. this isnt
a picture contest. come on

119
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,235
What are you doing?
got a new car?

120
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:47,536
Its stolen.

121
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:49,018
See that.

122
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,519
20 minutes to walk, 20 steps.

123
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,820
thats what you get from two packs a day.

124
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:00,830
I got you two sandwiches

125
00:13:00,831 --> 00:13:03,131
thats plenty grand

126
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,460
thank you... I love you.

127
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:08,289
how can I repay you

128
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:13,868
must be a big surprise

129
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:20,025
Jeff Roybal...
Special agent Ferris.

130
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:22,625
I don't need to say that
everything you say...

131
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:26,891
can be used
against you. Did we understand each other?

132
00:13:27,592 --> 00:13:28,892
sure.

133
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,544
tell me about Cris Johnson.
- I don't know who that is.

134
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:34,405
how about Frank Cadillac, you
kicked him out of the casino tonight.

135
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:35,540
He stole a car from valet parking

136
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,333
Yes, yes I know Cadillac.

137
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:39,487
I thought he was cheating us at cards.

138
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:41,388
next thing I know hes tackling some
guy waving a gun -The gun wasnt his.

139
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:44,389
The man he tackled was one
of the two casino killers in reno.

140
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,490
he is in custody now

141
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:48,791
come on, I want to show you something.

142
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:50,849
you remember this?

143
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:54,833
Yes, of course yes.

144
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:56,680
we were saying that
he was looking right at us.

145
00:13:56,881 --> 00:13:58,981
- how did you get this?
- now think carefully.

146
00:13:58,982 --> 00:14:00,882
what were you talking
about when he looked up?

147
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,083
we were saying that if he had
a system why wasnt he bidding more

148
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:05,384
you sure you werent doing or saying
anything else?

149
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:07,455
mumbles...

150
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:10,456
and right then.
would that be very specific

151
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:13,157
thats what I said and
he looked up. really

152
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:18,919
so he doesnt have to be there to do it

153
00:14:19,955 --> 00:14:21,485
is that to work the system.

154
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:23,554
Thank you.
Were finished.

155
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,193
done some good in there, Mr Roybal

156
00:14:30,484 --> 00:14:35,000
as far as your concerned.
this person never existed

157
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:38,023
thats going to be difficult. considering
theres a hundred cameras at the casino

158
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,115
Don't worry,
the tapes have been destroyed.

159
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,556
You can have those cars
and things of that type...

160
00:14:47,557 --> 00:14:49,857
but thats not a life.

161
00:14:50,368 --> 00:14:53,823
but you kind of forget that girl.
that you Keep seeing in your head.

162
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:56,485
I am not going anywhere
until I meet her

163
00:14:56,714 --> 00:14:58,400
And where do you think about going?

164
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,730
she already did.
Its a diner.

165
00:15:01,492 --> 00:15:02,674
10 for the 8.

166
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:05,700
But youve got a couple of hours.
how about a game of pool?

167
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:08,666
Allright, Irv. We'll shoot some pool.

168
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,886
pretend Here hes at Black Jack.

169
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:13,887
And the 6 card 21

170
00:15:13,988 --> 00:15:17,088
he want it so we know he can stay
at least a minute and a half ahead

171
00:15:17,823 --> 00:15:19,998
i had a text from a radio
frequency detection analysis

172
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:24,128
he is not receiving any form
of electronic help

173
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:28,086
at one point there was a
2 minutes and 16 seconds delay

174
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:31,243
He never backed.
just got up and walked away.

175
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,531
maybe 2.16 is too long
and he cannot see that far

176
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,932
narrows the window

177
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,375
We got him

178
00:15:37,476 --> 00:15:40,576
Vegas PD got a lo-jack hit
on the stolen vehicle.

179
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:47,620
Look.

180
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:49,792
about that girl.

181
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:53,246
about the clock.
Do you happen to see if its Canada?

182
00:15:53,247 --> 00:15:54,547
Because...

183
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:57,704
Because its could be 10 years

184
00:15:57,705 --> 00:15:59,345
Its gotta be soon.

185
00:15:59,577 --> 00:16:01,358
I never see further ahead than two minutes

186
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:03,159
Except for her

187
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,536
And what do you think
the reason is for that?

188
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:07,937
I don't know.

189
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:09,702
Maybe she doesn't scare easy.

190
00:16:11,243 --> 00:16:12,775
Maybe she is the one

191
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:16,800
when you get like this...

192
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:19,649
there is no talking to you.

193
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:23,359
she is on the street

194
00:16:24,336 --> 00:16:25,621
This is somebody else. cop.

195
00:16:25,622 --> 00:16:26,922
A cop?

196
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:28,058
you had better go.

197
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:31,359
Wait,I want to see how much she knows,what
she wants from me.

198
00:16:34,408 --> 00:16:35,767
Mr. Johnson.

199
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,087
Still here huh?.

200
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:38,388
Where else would I be?

201
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:42,470
Special agent Ferris.
next time steal a car without lojack.

202
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:46,261
Can we speak privately?

203
00:16:48,598 --> 00:16:51,096
its ok, Irv,you can go.
Thank you.

204
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,432
You know why im here.

205
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,708
Youre the man that knows what
im going to do before I do it. right?

206
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:04,109
Right?

207
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:07,869
The show, right?

208
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:10,939
Yes, I saw you there.

209
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,440
wonderful. Do you like magic?

210
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:15,041
Yes, I like yes.

211
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:18,742
Magic tricks, clairvoyance,
whatever you call it.

212
00:17:20,246 --> 00:17:22,269
Lets see something hard.

213
00:17:22,478 --> 00:17:27,487
stolen nucleur munitions being smuggled
into the US and may already be here.

214
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:32,684
I want you to look ahead and tell me
where it is going to be deployed

215
00:17:36,962 --> 00:17:39,008
I think you got the wrong guy and...

216
00:17:39,663 --> 00:17:41,579
Its a magic act.

217
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,240
you gonna stick with that story.

218
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:45,396
because millions of lives are at risk.

219
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:48,255
you could maybe prevent a major catastrophe

220
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:56,080
on a practical note. we are
standing in front of a stolen vehicle.

221
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:59,026
and you are wanted for assault
involving a weapon at a casino

222
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:02,154
that was an accident. he had a gun
and he was going to shoot two people

223
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:02,978
yes?

224
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,100
how did you know that

225
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:15,354
The deed goes unpunished does it?

226
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,023
I can fix your legal problems..

227
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:19,998
but you gotta step up

228
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,999
Or else your next
magic show...

229
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,300
will be in the state prison.

230
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:28,355
its ironic but...

231
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:32,809
people like you who try to help
end up torturing me

232
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,110
in the full sense of the word
since I was 3 years old.

233
00:18:36,678 --> 00:18:38,220
what do they call it...

234
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,955
observed play therapy.

235
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,956
A marathon 36 hours...

236
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:49,257
can you guess the next flash card game?

237
00:18:50,414 --> 00:18:51,717
so, please...

238
00:18:52,258 --> 00:18:53,761
leave me alone.

239
00:18:54,056 --> 00:18:56,747
Let me live some semblence of a normal life.

240
00:18:57,835 --> 00:18:59,933
I would love to indulge
your feelings. But Im dealing...

241
00:19:00,335 --> 00:19:02,514
with a slightly larger picture right now

242
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:05,655
now you can exercise your responsibility
to help your fellow men...

243
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,653
or I will exercise that
responsibility for you.

244
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:18,482
right, I gotta go.

245
00:19:35,278 --> 00:19:36,567
he's gone, right?

246
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:41,444
this is my seconds tonight

247
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,534
excuse me honey, can you get off my car

248
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:52,954
- Yes.
- Thank you.

249
00:19:53,658 --> 00:19:54,809
Sr. Roybal.

250
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,955
Can I help you?

251
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:59,510
I have a few
questions, is this a good time?

252
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:04,376
the Commission is after hours
you guys should be in a strip club come on

253
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:07,150
What can you tell us about Cris Johnson?

254
00:20:09,895 --> 00:20:12,076
I don't know who your talking about

255
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,924
let me rephrase the question.

256
00:21:55,428 --> 00:21:57,184
- The menu.
- Yes, thank you.

257
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:10,815
Excuse.
Hello!

258
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:16,036
unless your alone too.
do you mind if I join you?

259
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:18,437
actually I do

260
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:39,605
sorry to bother you. I have
a question about the coffee...

261
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:41,937
the bean they use

262
00:22:42,047 --> 00:22:44,394
isnt that something you should
probably ask your waitress?

263
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,100
Yes, it is

264
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,657
excuse me, do you have a light?

265
00:22:56,658 --> 00:22:57,958
I don't smoke.

266
00:23:05,463 --> 00:23:07,331
Please. No.

267
00:23:26,414 --> 00:23:28,184
did you follow me here or something?

268
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,403
No, I just thought we could talk

269
00:23:30,404 --> 00:23:33,404
you know we got nothing to talk about.

270
00:23:33,405 --> 00:23:35,705
I told you that 3 weeks ago.

271
00:23:36,152 --> 00:23:39,656
Liz, come on. I had an off day
just give me another chance

272
00:23:41,198 --> 00:23:44,032
its not going to happen,
so maybe you should just go

273
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:47,313
do you know how hard it was to find you?

274
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:48,770
I was at your apartment,

275
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:50,869
I tried the Starbox, in Lexington,
I was at the dry cleaners

276
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,170
All Im asking for is
a few minutes of your time.

277
00:23:57,137 --> 00:23:59,076
My God! your stalking me

278
00:23:59,177 --> 00:24:02,400
Don't say that,thats
a terrible thing to say...

279
00:24:03,617 --> 00:24:05,257
let go of me.

280
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,717
I only want to talk,
maybe we can take a drive..

281
00:24:09,094 --> 00:24:10,539
your hurting me.

282
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,921
Kendal.

283
00:24:11,922 --> 00:24:13,236
I think your having another off day

284
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:14,524
who the hell are you?

285
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:15,901
I'm her future.

286
00:24:16,543 --> 00:24:17,877
Really?

287
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:23,051
Hello, my name is Cris.

288
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,070
you okay, Kendal?

289
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:33,225
The thing is I feel connected...

290
00:24:33,226 --> 00:24:35,425
and I don't know the reason why.

291
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,986
Now listen.

292
00:24:39,242 --> 00:24:41,606
I think it would be at least fair
you pay for the ladies breakfast

293
00:24:43,385 --> 00:24:45,916

294
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:49,955

00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:02,338

301
00:25:05,452 --> 00:25:07,050
This is coming.

302
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,306
My God! Kendal!

303
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,965

308
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:23,867
Come here,lets get
you cleaned up.

309
00:25:34,745 --> 00:25:36,893
I see stars.

310
00:25:38,988 --> 00:25:40,345
I am Liz.

311
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:42,552
I am Cris.

312
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,123
you must have a death wish
getting involved in that.

313
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:52,319
Hold it there.

314
00:25:52,597 --> 00:25:53,930
to stanch.

315
00:26:01,516 --> 00:26:02,799
well?

316
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,415
what well?

317
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
your luck,

318
00:26:05,441 --> 00:26:06,696
its gonna change.

319
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:10,051
what are you? a leprauchaun

320
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,647
do leprachaun's get punched in the face?
or have their car stolen.

321
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:21,628
your car was stolen?

322
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:25,235
I'm hoping they find it today.

323
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:28,431
I think was in Flags Stags.

324
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:33,506
Hey, is this tooth loose here?

325
00:26:35,196 --> 00:26:36,961
Don't I know?
I don't think so.

326
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:39,907
Hurt.

327
00:26:42,515 --> 00:26:44,382
well listen, I guess I can give you a ride.

328
00:26:44,677 --> 00:26:45,734
Im going that way.

329
00:26:45,735 --> 00:26:47,743
That would really be helpful.

330
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:49,614
Thank you.

331
00:26:49,788 --> 00:26:51,463
I do have to make a stop though.

332
00:26:52,151 --> 00:26:53,549
Thats ok.

333
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:55,116
and it may take a few hours...

334
00:26:55,117 --> 00:26:56,417
if that isnt a problem.

335
00:26:58,873 --> 00:27:02,150
look if your uncomfortable with this...
I will take a bus.

336
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:05,834
No, no. Its fine,its fine
your not a psycho

337
00:27:08,115 --> 00:27:09,499
right?

338
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,505
The first sign of a psycho
I kick you out of the car.

339
00:27:12,971 --> 00:27:15,043
ok. Yes Ma'am
- Right.

340
00:27:15,996 --> 00:27:17,296
deal

341
00:27:18,627 --> 00:27:19,848
deal

342
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:30,956
hey

343
00:27:30,957 --> 00:27:32,257
and then

344
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,237
end up in a diner where you are and
both heading in the same direction.

345
00:27:38,502 --> 00:27:40,844
I don't know if I can call
that amazing, but...

346
00:27:40,845 --> 00:27:42,145
thats destiny.

347
00:27:42,614 --> 00:27:44,106
Thats what it really is

348
00:27:45,553 --> 00:27:48,161
your starting to get the psycho on.

349
00:27:49,428 --> 00:27:50,810
Ah, no... you don't believe in destiny?

350
00:27:52,407 --> 00:27:56,071
even if it does exist,
I just don't want to know

351
00:27:56,577 --> 00:27:59,558
I mean if every move you make
is pre-ordained.

352
00:28:01,006 --> 00:28:03,291
What is the point
life is supposed to a surprise

353
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:09,390
It would be nice.

354
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:26,771
hes came in twice a day for
a week at exactly 9 past 8?

355
00:28:27,816 --> 00:28:30,074
Yes, he would stay a few minutes,
have a martini and then he'd go.

356
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,840
not today when he was with that lady.

357
00:28:32,216 --> 00:28:33,956
Did you find anything strange about that?

358
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:36,409
not strange enough to call the police.

359
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,027
we got a regular who counts
the cornflakes in his bowel.

360
00:28:38,128 --> 00:28:39,628
because it has to be an even number.

361
00:28:39,728 --> 00:28:41,115
do you have any cameras?

362
00:28:41,198 --> 00:28:42,678
Inside? No.

363
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,227
outside?

364
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,498
No.

365
00:28:46,828 --> 00:28:48,476
do you know the kind of car
he was driving?

366
00:28:48,577 --> 00:28:50,077
or maybe overhear
where they were going?

367
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,660
I don't know what car but they were leaving
for cascade.

368
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:54,532
thats what they said

369
00:28:54,757 --> 00:28:58,174
Another regular. she's always on a diet.
brings in a scale with the salad dressing

370
00:28:58,576 --> 00:28:59,828
Thank you.

371
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:01,189
You're welcome.

372
00:29:03,107 --> 00:29:05,680
this guy knows we are after him.
he saw us coming here.

373
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,296
8 or 9. twice a day

374
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:09,151
he doesnt know if its day or night,
its the time he's waiting for her.

375
00:29:11,142 --> 00:29:12,928
There is a traffic camera
over there. At the bank.

376
00:29:13,129 --> 00:29:15,384
7-11 across the street. just run all
the tapes we will get lucky.

377
00:29:15,485 --> 00:29:16,785
and catch them at the wide

378
00:29:17,467 --> 00:29:18,940
Remember roybal. the casino chief?

379
00:29:18,941 --> 00:29:21,872
he had his throat cut last night.
after getting a knee cap shot off.

380
00:29:21,957 --> 00:29:24,611
your telling me this now?
we were just talking about Johnson?

381
00:29:24,612 --> 00:29:25,500
hey I just found out.

382
00:29:25,501 --> 00:29:26,801
alright.

383
00:29:27,436 --> 00:29:28,413
got the weapon?

384
00:29:28,414 --> 00:29:29,479
dead end

385
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,064
Forensic's came up emtpy.
Not a hair or a fibre.

386
00:29:32,096 --> 00:29:34,410
Somebody wants information,
next time anything happens...

387
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:36,314
relevent to Johnson,
I want to know right away.

388
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:38,376
I dont care if its a paper clip.

389
00:29:38,436 --> 00:29:39,561
ok boss.

390
00:31:04,858 --> 00:31:06,948
The head of casino security.

391
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,128
What did you learn from him?

392
00:31:08,317 --> 00:31:11,345
for a macho guy, he screams like a girl.

393
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,549
he was questioned by federal agents,
looking for Chris Jonhson.

394
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,296
Yes?

395
00:31:15,483 --> 00:31:17,171
He said they
hadn't found him yet.

396
00:31:18,246 --> 00:31:19,822
Do you believe this shit?

397
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:22,820
he see's things before they happen?

398
00:31:24,271 --> 00:31:26,899
it makes no difference
what I believe.

399
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,663
look, we spent two
years setting this up.

400
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:33,691
And that man out there is worried
all this will be comprimised by Johnson

401
00:31:34,533 --> 00:31:37,756
We are wasting our time with this.
for a magician.

402
00:31:38,383 --> 00:31:40,941
we are being paid to secure
the operations room.

403
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:43,079
not to hunt down some
carnival party

404
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,853
really?

405
00:31:43,988 --> 00:31:46,572
then why are the
same authorities that

406
00:31:46,673 --> 00:31:48,173
are looking for us
so interested in him?

407
00:31:51,221 --> 00:31:52,274
get rid of him.

408
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:54,718
do it now.

409
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:24,941
We have a super reservation.

410
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:26,646
I teach there once a week.

411
00:32:26,647 --> 00:32:28,515
The conditions are pretty lousy.

412
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:30,167
Thats in the Great Canyon.

413
00:32:30,503 --> 00:32:32,104
One of the eight wonders of the world.

414
00:32:32,105 --> 00:32:33,023
Hello, Sam.

415
00:32:33,069 --> 00:32:33,941
Hello, Liz.

416
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:36,307
A couple hundred years ago
this place was booming

417
00:32:36,408 --> 00:32:38,858
plenty of food and thriving culture.

418
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:42,827
they should be better off.
I guess this is destiny then.

419
00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:45,458
I would like to meet there shaman.

420
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:48,140
I read once, in the many
North American tribes.

421
00:32:48,241 --> 00:32:50,903
That the shamans purpose
wasn't only healing.

422
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:53,766
And that they also claim
their power of the atmosphere.

423
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:56,319
To bring on and stop rain

424
00:32:58,266 --> 00:33:00,146
even though future advance.

425
00:33:00,597 --> 00:33:02,175
Do you think thats possible?

426
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:04,424
I believe any thing is possible.

427
00:33:05,975 --> 00:33:07,100
Me too.

428
00:33:15,097 --> 00:33:16,347

429
00:33:16,348 --> 00:33:17,511
only one of my students.

430
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:21,578
Hi.

431
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:23,442
Hows it going?

432
00:33:23,624 --> 00:33:25,970
Hello, how this everybody?

00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:26,872

434
00:33:36,726 --> 00:33:38,118

435
00:33:38,256 --> 00:33:41,358
thats good.
only messed up in the last part.

436
00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:42,703
Yes in the last part.

437
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,985
I thought you werent coming back
til next monday

438
00:33:45,986 --> 00:33:49,284
well Im not, but its Jay's birthday.
and I couldnt miss that.

439
00:33:49,285 --> 00:33:51,383
Who is that man with you?

440
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:55,238
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No, no not my boyfriend.

441
00:33:55,339 --> 00:33:56,786
just my friend.

442
00:33:57,105 --> 00:33:58,685
I think he likes you.

443
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:01,850
why do you say that?

444
00:34:01,899 --> 00:34:05,144
Because he looks at you like
my brother looks at his girlfriend.

445
00:34:22,278 --> 00:34:24,624
hey Jay.
Doe you want to see some magic?

446
00:34:24,914 --> 00:34:26,228
I will show you something.
Come here.

447
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:29,037
I found this rock out
in the Canyon.

448
00:34:29,038 --> 00:34:31,431
I want you to hold this
its a magic rock.

449
00:34:31,432 --> 00:34:34,562
hold it really tight keep squeezing

450
00:34:35,684 --> 00:34:36,812
It's magic.

451
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,824
it wont bite.

452
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:45,204
Happy birthday.

453
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,011
so your a magician?

454
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,673
Well.

455
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:56,340
I have a small magic act
back in Vegas.

456
00:34:56,736 --> 00:34:58,590
Frank Cadillac show.

457
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:00,352
I thought your name was Chris.

458
00:35:00,353 --> 00:35:01,122
It is.

459
00:35:01,123 --> 00:35:03,472
Frank Cadillac is my stage name.

460
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:05,642
how did you come up with that?

461
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,903
I took two things I really like
and I put them together.

462
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,981
Frankenstein and Cadillac.

463
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,666
Your odd.

464
00:35:16,355 --> 00:35:17,558
Charming.

465
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:19,603
But odd.

466
00:35:28,554 --> 00:35:29,870
cease fire

467
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:31,408
get out of the range

468
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:33,482
Nice

469
00:35:34,322 --> 00:35:35,576
It was close though?

470
00:35:39,135 --> 00:35:40,036
ok.

471
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:42,934
you were right about the traffic camera

472
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,371
We got a positive ID

473
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:10,089
Chris?

474
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:11,915
its ok.

475
00:36:14,753 --> 00:36:15,689
Did I snore?

476
00:36:15,932 --> 00:36:17,014
snore?

477
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,678
- Yes.
- Ah, no.

478
00:36:22,691 --> 00:36:25,177
As and that worsened
so much like this the climate?

479
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:26,292
Yes.

480
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:29,325
I like the rain.

481
00:36:32,915 --> 00:36:34,175
I like rain too

482
00:36:37,015 --> 00:36:38,001
do you know once...

483
00:36:38,002 --> 00:36:40,054
I think was in Denmark,

484
00:36:40,055 --> 00:36:41,920
it rained fish...

485
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:44,312
because the sun dehydrated the water.

486
00:36:44,313 --> 00:36:46,548
took it out in the atmosphere.

487
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:51,067
rehydrated the fish eggs, and
it hatched and it..

488
00:36:51,068 --> 00:36:52,104
and it rained fish.

489
00:36:53,066 --> 00:36:54,103
That the truth?

490
00:36:54,104 --> 00:36:58,290
Yes, in the clouds. true story.
happened 15 years ago.

491
00:36:59,737 --> 00:37:01,391
felt like sharing that
with you.

492
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:13,934
The road's washed out ahead.
you can't cross until morning.

493
00:37:14,035 --> 00:37:15,814
not even then its a sure shot

494
00:37:15,815 --> 00:37:18,772
spin around and go back about two miles
take your second left

495
00:37:18,873 --> 00:37:21,413
- there will be a hotel there called...
- The Cliff Hangar. Thank you.

496
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,682
Correct.

497
00:37:32,553 --> 00:37:34,040
him right?

498
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:36,918
thats it

499
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:40,440
no front plate,
where is the other side?

500
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:42,595
I don't have it.

501
00:37:43,776 --> 00:37:45,699
What was that at the front window?
go back

502
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,562
Back,back.

503
00:37:47,986 --> 00:37:49,166
back, there!

504
00:37:49,337 --> 00:37:50,312
Zoom in.

505
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:55,681
its a permit.

506
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:58,054
Track it and find it.

507
00:38:06,686 --> 00:38:08,041
I will light a fire.

508
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:21,551
Chris, one little problem.

509
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:25,572
no, no, I will sleep in the car.

510
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:35,803
- Take it.
- Thank you.

511
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:36,678
sure.

512
00:38:37,486 --> 00:38:41,193
you hear the joke about the zen master
who ordered a hot dog?

513
00:38:41,997 --> 00:38:43,017
No.

514
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:45,717
He said that he would have
one with everything.

515
00:38:50,172 --> 00:38:51,363
Good night.

516
00:38:52,227 --> 00:38:53,717
Good night.

517
00:39:49,355 --> 00:39:51,097
What have we got?

518
00:39:51,281 --> 00:39:53,879
They went to sleep in a motel
outside cascade.

519
00:39:53,886 --> 00:39:56,786
We found an Arizona foreman
who remembers the land cruiser.

520
00:39:56,787 --> 00:39:58,068
How did they do that?

521
00:39:58,069 --> 00:40:01,483
The road was blocked and he was about to
suggest a place to stay.

522
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,921
But Johnson already know, right?

523
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,207
Exactly.

524
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,853
Callie, it just got worse

525
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:15,090
all right people,
we got a nuclear alert. code red.

526
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:16,943
In the southern California region.

527
00:40:17,004 --> 00:40:19,981
LA to San Diego,
95% proven.

528
00:40:20,145 --> 00:40:23,391
nuclear emergency search teams are on
there way. but until they get here...

529
00:40:23,761 --> 00:40:27,606
somebody please tell me wht my
agency, the FBI are doing about it?

530
00:40:27,978 --> 00:40:30,417
sir, two main suspects
have been interrogated.

531
00:40:30,726 --> 00:40:33,890
cars and transmits have been checked
perimeter was revised and...

532
00:40:33,891 --> 00:40:37,051
we have opened up surveillance on 2 or 3
suspects but nothing actionable yet.

533
00:40:37,052 --> 00:40:39,677
Then what the hell are we doing?
waiting for something actionable...

534
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,816
we got 8 million lives
that are precaurious at best

535
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:43,834
so I say we widen this net
to slightly suspicious

536
00:40:43,935 --> 00:40:45,432
and get some decent Intel

537
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:47,264
before this nuke blows up Los Angeles.

538
00:40:48,684 --> 00:40:49,771
alright, Callie.

539
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,767
What do you propose we do next?

540
00:40:51,837 --> 00:40:54,509
I believe that the
urgency of the situation...

541
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:57,669
compels the use of any and all resources to
obtain Cris Johnson.

542
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,700
We know where he is.

543
00:40:58,808 --> 00:41:00,128
let my team pick him up

544
00:41:07,412 --> 00:41:08,767
The FBI are mobilizing.

545
00:41:09,181 --> 00:41:10,687
Continue watching.

546
00:41:10,924 --> 00:41:12,762
- Did you listen?
- Yes.

547
00:41:12,983 --> 00:41:14,724
He says they are mobilising.

548
00:41:15,271 --> 00:41:17,868
standard procedure

549
00:41:18,964 --> 00:41:22,302
tell them to wrap it up
They will lead us straight to Johnson.

550
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,639
- Don't lose sight of them
- Certainly, ok.

551
00:41:42,098 --> 00:41:44,165
you hungry? there is
a coffee shop down the road

552
00:41:44,687 --> 00:41:46,452
I'd rather eat here,
if thats ok.

553
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,054
fine.

554
00:41:58,936 --> 00:42:00,022
What?

555
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:08,703
there is an Italian painter
named Calion.

556
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,167
he...

557
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,978
he defined beauty...

558
00:42:15,037 --> 00:42:17,346
he said it was a summation of the parts...

559
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:20,759
working together in such a way
in such a way...

560
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:22,891
that nothing needed to added

561
00:42:23,435 --> 00:42:25,524
taken away or altered

562
00:42:26,739 --> 00:42:27,801
like you

563
00:42:31,151 --> 00:42:32,917
your beautiful.

564
00:42:37,235 --> 00:42:38,562
wow!

565
00:42:49,248 --> 00:42:50,938
It was incredible

566
00:42:52,007 --> 00:42:53,390
What was?

567
00:42:55,128 --> 00:42:57,345
This.

568
00:43:18,189 --> 00:43:21,940
Its good here, the best place to
view hotel.

569
00:43:21,991 --> 00:43:25,651
We should cover different places,
that road and that turn off.

570
00:43:26,031 --> 00:43:27,734
A team with a parabolic step right here.

571
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:30,171
thats fine, but I also
want mobile surveillance...

572
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:33,257
for case something skirt of the
control. I want to be flexible

573
00:43:33,465 --> 00:43:34,593
Ferris?

574
00:43:37,691 --> 00:43:40,801
call the local police in flagstaff.
have them patrol the outside perimeter

575
00:43:41,002 --> 00:43:42,502
I want that area locked down.

576
00:43:44,023 --> 00:43:47,051
A body turned up at an apartment,
in line of sight of my office...

577
00:43:47,052 --> 00:43:48,986
with a slit throat,
like roybal.

578
00:43:48,987 --> 00:43:50,921
The body trying to follow us to
Johnson.

579
00:44:06,347 --> 00:44:08,344
Chris?

580
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:11,200
Yes.

581
00:44:13,669 --> 00:44:16,463
Maybe destiny exists.

582
00:44:50,965 --> 00:44:52,474
give 40 seconds.

583
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:02,061
Within two minutes,
he will start seeing whats going to happen

584
00:45:02,134 --> 00:45:03,934
I hope so.

585
00:45:22,524 --> 00:45:24,910
- Elizabeth Cooper?
- Yes.

586
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,949
Federal agent Ferris.

587
00:45:29,748 --> 00:45:31,121
what is this about?

588
00:45:31,122 --> 00:45:32,122
I only need a few minutes of your time

589
00:45:39,796 --> 00:45:41,354
Yes,sure.

590
00:45:52,185 --> 00:45:54,038
They are putting her in the car.

591
00:46:00,412 --> 00:46:02,287
Back.

592
00:46:02,432 --> 00:46:04,941
He will shoot in those people.

593
00:46:11,361 --> 00:46:13,680
this was 3 days ago?

594
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:15,962
He used you to get away from Las Vegas.

595
00:46:16,035 --> 00:46:17,669
Everything that he told you...

596
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:21,528
and lie and illusion.
He's a sociopath

597
00:46:25,629 --> 00:46:27,073
My God.

598
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:32,946
Drugs.

599
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:39,028
Return to the hotel, have
a drink put one of these...

600
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,244
in his glass

601
00:46:41,345 --> 00:46:44,120
It will take 5 minutes to put him to
sleep, then we will come in and get him

602
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:46,695
But this is important

603
00:46:46,896 --> 00:46:49,053
you need to do it at least 2 minutes
after you get him out of the room.

604
00:46:49,157 --> 00:46:51,046
that to enter in the room.

605
00:46:54,434 --> 00:46:57,275
why do you need me?
why dont you just get him.

606
00:46:58,082 --> 00:47:00,789
He seems to think that you work
for a pedagogic program...

607
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:04,026
for a reservation with bottoms
federal, is that true?

608
00:47:05,987 --> 00:47:08,076
Yes, thats true

609
00:47:08,077 --> 00:47:12,087
Good, we need you to help us,
we are on the same team.

610
00:47:28,189 --> 00:47:30,214
go

611
00:47:50,221 --> 00:47:51,814
- hey

612
00:47:52,097 --> 00:47:54,868
- thanks for the
- sure

613
00:47:55,191 --> 00:47:59,607
Did you have a nice walk?
Yes,I did. Its really beautiful here.

614
00:48:02,494 --> 00:48:05,435
Ah! I have a present for you.

615
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:10,433
Ah, thanks
there was no need.

616
00:48:10,602 --> 00:48:11,821
Yeah

617
00:48:28,517 --> 00:48:30,049
Something wrong?

618
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:34,548
No, no... Why dont you go wash up

619
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,460
- I'll cook breakfast.
- ok.

620
00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:31,092
45 seconds.

621
00:49:55,714 --> 00:49:57,927
Minute 30.

622
00:50:25,612 --> 00:50:28,169
next

623
00:50:43,213 --> 00:50:44,849
everything ok?.

624
00:50:46,104 --> 00:50:47,374
Thank you.

625
00:50:59,499 --> 00:51:03,055
Don't drink that!
its drugged

626
00:51:03,546 --> 00:51:06,696
God, I don't know what do!
I don't know what im doing

627
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:12,217
A federal agent came to me
and said that you were a sociopath.

628
00:51:13,286 --> 00:51:16,493
Maybe you are
but I dont want to believe that.

629
00:51:16,494 --> 00:51:18,282
I don't think is true.

630
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:22,086
they also said that if
you to escape they will kill you.

631
00:51:23,001 --> 00:51:24,945
so I drug you instead

632
00:51:26,033 --> 00:51:28,710
Even if is true what she said.

633
00:51:29,441 --> 00:51:31,434
I don't want you to die.

634
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,973
Is this true?

635
00:51:43,314 --> 00:51:45,199
Chris?

636
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:15,616
Remove that collapsed,
I'm not hearing that

637
00:52:15,902 --> 00:52:17,332
Speak quietly.

638
00:52:18,772 --> 00:52:20,848
how long does this drug take to have effect?

639
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:25,067
About 5 minutes.

640
00:52:36,678 --> 00:52:39,180
- What is he doing?
- he's drinking.

641
00:52:39,345 --> 00:52:40,981
give it a minute.

642
00:52:41,729 --> 00:52:43,434
that a clean shot?

643
00:52:46,477 --> 00:52:47,787
Not yet.

644
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:59,127
In the casino
I will kill two people.

645
00:53:00,591 --> 00:53:04,182
It happened, it just hadnt happen yet

646
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:10,135
My God.
Then its true.

647
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,947
We will prepare pancakes for the kids

648
00:53:19,982 --> 00:53:24,513
We will prepare pancakes for the kids.

649
00:53:24,562 --> 00:53:26,349
Safe.
Who knows whats safe

650
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:28,449
no man dropped dead from looking at his wife

651
00:53:28,771 --> 00:53:31,747
Safe.
Who knows what's safe

652
00:53:32,037 --> 00:53:34,491
no man dropped dead from looking at his wife

653
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:37,362
You can't get lost in the woods
if you never go in to the woods

654
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:41,394
You can't get lost in the woods
if you never go in to the woods

655
00:53:43,996 --> 00:53:47,049
right sir your the only person
authorised to do so

656
00:53:47,885 --> 00:53:51,484
right sir your the only person
authorised to do so

657
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:54,476
- How does you do that?
- I have no idea.

658
00:53:55,047 --> 00:53:58,363
I just know that I can,
I was born like that.

659
00:54:02,107 --> 00:54:03,631
is that some kind of a trick?

660
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:05,586
We don't have time for that.

661
00:54:05,946 --> 00:54:08,159
who said that anything is possible.

662
00:54:13,225 --> 00:54:15,691
you see things
before they happen.

663
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:19,775
- Do you see the future?
- My future.

664
00:54:19,876 --> 00:54:22,536
Only what affects me and only within
2 minute ahead...

665
00:54:23,556 --> 00:54:26,939
except with you. For
some reason I saw you.

666
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:32,676
For some reason I saw you further
than anything ive ever seen before

667
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:34,397
I don't know why

668
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:39,372
what do you mean?you saw me?

669
00:54:40,908 --> 00:54:43,843
Have you been doing that to me?

670
00:54:45,581 --> 00:54:48,273
do you know. what im going to do
and what im going to say?

671
00:54:48,397 --> 00:54:50,813
that your setting me up?
It was not like this.

672
00:54:51,932 --> 00:54:55,130
I wanted you from the
first time I ever see you.

673
00:54:55,814 --> 00:54:57,289
Because I...

674
00:55:03,029 --> 00:55:04,715
It was not a setup.

675
00:55:21,979 --> 00:55:23,524
What do they want from you?

676
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,782
They believe that I can be
useful in national security.

677
00:55:43,163 --> 00:55:47,168
I don't understand. How can you help them.
why cant you do it?

678
00:55:47,392 --> 00:55:52,998
Because I cant. I only can
only see two minutes into the future.

679
00:55:57,634 --> 00:55:59,652
want you to read this
and wait exactly...

680
00:55:59,658 --> 00:56:02,603
45 seconds before
you do what it says.

681
00:56:02,636 --> 00:56:04,613
I will take Ferris with me.

682
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,145
I will be away a month...

683
00:56:07,206 --> 00:56:10,022
but if you wait,
I find you.

684
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:33,153
something's wrong.

685
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:06,774
dont do it.
- I already did it.

686
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:14,892
get him!
alive!

687
00:57:14,893 --> 00:57:16,343
Lets go!

688
00:57:49,483 --> 00:57:51,139
Damn!

689
00:59:13,898 --> 00:59:15,191
Johnson.

690
00:59:18,807 --> 00:59:20,740
your not gonna shoot.

691
00:59:31,482 --> 00:59:33,272
Will you let me die?

692
01:00:03,131 --> 01:00:05,424
I need help!get him out of here.

693
01:00:10,276 --> 01:00:12,030
I got you.

694
01:00:16,983 --> 01:00:21,154
you ok? Open your eyes.
Look at me

695
01:00:22,148 --> 01:00:24,756
no deed goes unpunished does it?

696
01:00:30,155 --> 01:00:32,391
- They got him.
now what?

697
01:00:36,236 --> 01:00:37,687
Did you see her?

698
01:01:06,897 --> 01:01:08,302
you smoke?

699
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:21,760
Thank you for today.

700
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:24,681
you could have left me
to die. thanks

701
01:01:25,653 --> 01:01:27,806
you really showed character.

702
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:34,751
I know that I seem
like a bad guy

703
01:01:34,852 --> 01:01:37,304
its with the objective of
preserving our freedom.

704
01:01:37,342 --> 01:01:39,608
there are larger issues at hand

705
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:45,836
what about my freedom?

706
01:01:46,546 --> 01:01:49,155
freedom comes with
responsibility.

707
01:01:51,581 --> 01:01:54,646
- I have rights
- It isnt about you.

708
01:01:54,765 --> 01:01:57,423
It is about 8 million
other people.

709
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:03,080
If I do what you want,
you will keep me in this chair forever.

710
01:02:04,996 --> 01:02:08,062
There is a nuclear bomb
somewhere in Los Angeles.

711
01:02:09,022 --> 01:02:11,609
Every television station
in the world will broadcast...

712
01:02:11,741 --> 01:02:16,779
the site details. so go on,
push that two minutes

713
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:20,471
as far as you can and find it

714
01:03:05,951 --> 01:03:07,714
we have breaking news

715
01:03:07,739 --> 01:03:10,005
from downtown las vegas.

716
01:03:10,915 --> 01:03:13,454
The corporations is opposed the idea.

717
01:03:17,311 --> 01:03:18,602
Members of the LAPD bombsquad

718
01:03:18,635 --> 01:03:19,881
are searching in this area.

719
01:03:19,892 --> 01:03:22,046
We have a reporter...

720
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:25,085
joining us at the scence
for the very latest

721
01:03:25,088 --> 01:03:27,976
it all began when police received an
anonymous phone call...

722
01:03:28,016 --> 01:03:30,639
saying that explosives would be detonated...

723
01:03:30,862 --> 01:03:34,664
in this parking lot,at second
and Broadway at 6 o'clock tonight.

724
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:38,161
They have no idea of the motive

725
01:03:39,713 --> 01:03:42,173
What?

726
01:03:42,966 --> 01:03:44,472
What did you say?

727
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:48,315
they have secured a perimeter.
but now the bomb squad..

728
01:03:48,317 --> 01:03:52,172

the deck of this building

729
01:03:52,173 --> 01:03:55,146
and are walking up

730
01:04:01,533 --> 01:04:03,070
My God!

731
01:04:04,864 --> 01:04:08,927
There was an explosion.
There was an explosion.

732
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,959
Ah, my God.

733
01:04:13,423 --> 01:04:16,435
she has been identified as
Elizabeth jogle of Las vegas.

734
01:04:31,629 --> 01:04:33,190
I feel

735
01:04:44,353 --> 01:04:47,118
- What happened?
- I cant

736
01:04:47,575 --> 01:04:49,313

what you want

738
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,152

739
01:05:04,341 --> 01:05:05,863
Let him out.

01:05:18,815 --> 01:05:20,277
- Wait.

741
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:22,281

01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:23,904
the dead girl in the apartment

743
01:05:23,922 --> 01:05:25,400
she died from blood loss

744
01:05:25,401 --> 01:05:27,774
otherwise nothing

745
01:05:28,522 --> 01:05:30,363
- How did it go with johnson?
- Something happened.

746
01:05:30,464 --> 01:05:33,012
But he's not sharing. There
are traces of potassium and iodine.

747
01:05:33,156 --> 01:05:34,968
Some medication that
Peters was taking.

748
01:05:34,969 --> 01:05:36,286
they found an empty pill box

749
01:05:36,387 --> 01:05:39,777
No. the only reason to take it is to
prevent radiation poisining

750
01:05:49,299 --> 01:05:52,225
Wait. anyone gotta smoke
or something. I need to relax.

751
01:05:57,445 --> 01:06:01,530
Thank you.

752
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,495
look at this

753
01:07:13,734 --> 01:07:17,067
Air 1 to base.
I got visual...

754
01:07:17,123 --> 01:07:19,163
running for the south in the 5th street

755
01:07:26,478 --> 01:07:29,627
heading east onto Broadway.

756
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:54,223
here

757
01:08:43,033 --> 01:08:47,338
- why did you come here?
- They killed her.

758
01:08:49,217 --> 01:08:54,746
In two hours, they will kill Liz.

759
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:56,957
Tell me what saw.

760
01:08:58,469 --> 01:09:00,496
I saw them execute her.

761
01:09:03,233 --> 01:09:05,498
There.

762
01:09:12,456 --> 01:09:15,120
It hasnt happened yet.
And I know who has her.

763
01:09:16,342 --> 01:09:18,145
They are the same people
we are after.

764
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:20,669
They brought you here.
They are using Liz as bait.

765
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:24,048
As soon as you go out on that roof, they
are going to put a bullet in your brain

766
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:25,563
I know.

767
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:30,031
Right now, she is still alive.
she is, you are,we all are.

768
01:09:30,673 --> 01:09:32,457
try to keep it that way.

769
01:09:32,508 --> 01:09:34,447
you help me alright?

770
01:09:37,598 --> 01:09:41,659
I want a two mile radius.
All the telephones, short waves,

771
01:09:41,799 --> 01:09:46,509
- satellite tower, shut it down.
- What do you want me to do?

772
01:09:48,249 --> 01:09:49,877
to stay here

773
01:10:51,856 --> 01:10:54,217
You ok?
that looked pretty close

774
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:59,647
It was all in hand.
you didnt get him?

775
01:10:59,686 --> 01:11:01,376
no.
He fired on the helicopter.

776
01:11:01,569 --> 01:11:03,520
it doesn't matter,
he couldnt call in the hit.

777
01:11:03,757 --> 01:11:05,669
As far as they are concerned,
your not here yet

778
01:11:05,806 --> 01:11:07,377
We won some time.

779
01:11:11,169 --> 01:11:13,808
everyway I try she still ends up dead.

780
01:11:15,816 --> 01:11:18,431
If you do it earlier? They will have
to bring her here in a vehicle right?

781
01:11:18,651 --> 01:11:20,398
- License plate.
- right

782
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:31,140
Do you see it?

783
01:11:32,545 --> 01:11:35,134
It helps if you don't speak right now

784
01:12:30,645 --> 01:12:31,836
California plate number:

785
01:12:32,696 --> 01:12:36,768

786
01:12:36,861 --> 01:12:40,629
California tag: 50KF272.

787
01:13:00,268 --> 01:13:01,705
Where they are taking me?

788
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:05,052
What do you want from me?

789
01:13:08,703 --> 01:13:10,228
Careful.

790
01:13:12,136 --> 01:13:13,970

791
01:13:17,456 --> 01:13:18,819
cavanaugh

792
01:13:18,946 --> 01:13:21,906

to back us up

793
01:13:21,999 --> 01:13:23,961

The van carrying...

794

approximately 5 minutes.

01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:43,007
They will take this ramp
to the entrance door.

800
01:13:43,027 --> 01:13:45,066
In this point, alpha Bravo...

801
01:13:45,093 --> 01:13:48,580
if you can just be quiet.
and do exactly what I say...

802
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,511
I will save her life.

803
01:13:52,189 --> 01:13:55,037
We needed to stop the vehicle
here before it gets into there.

804
01:13:55,249 --> 01:13:58,966
Alpha and bravo they will
hold and contain here...

Nobody moves.

835
01:21:15,053 --> 01:21:16,532
I will find him

836
01:21:22,312 --> 01:21:24,276
In the second floor.

837
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:27,101
The 6'o clock. the second floor.

- You ok Liz.

847
01:24:10,585 --> 01:24:13,192
I see every possible ending here

848
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:16,861
- And none of them are good for you.
I will take that chance

849
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:23,017

doesnt look like it will be good for you

850

But if you wait for
me, I will find you.

877

every time that you look at it. It changes.

879
01:28:41,317 --> 01:28:45,937
Because you look at it. And that
changes everything else
