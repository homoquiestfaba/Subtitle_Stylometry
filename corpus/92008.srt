1
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,165
Ricky! Son!

2
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,375
Come back here!

3
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:46,213
Don't be too late.
I want you in by dark.

4
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:48,465
Watch out for your brother.

5
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,384
-I can watch out for myself.
-Can not!

6
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:51,885
Don't worry, Mama.

7
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:54,054
Why must you watch out for me?

8
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,727
Hush up.

9
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:03,898
Don't be reading anymore scary comics.
You hear me, Ricky?

10
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,358
-Whatever.
-He can't sleep.

11
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:10,946
I'll miss my bus. I'll be late again.

12
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:13,449
I'll get docked for sure.

13
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:18,955
There's some macaroni and cheese
in the cabinet, okay?

14
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,749
Got your lunch?

15
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:25,587
Keys?

16
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:30,717
Exact change for the bus?

17
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:32,969
Oh, shoot, baby, thank you.

18
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:34,471
Forget my head...

19
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:36,139
...if it wasn't screwed on.

20
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:40,311
You stay out of them woods.

21
00:01:40,686 --> 00:01:42,103
You hear me, Mark?

22
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:44,106
Bye, baby.

23
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:48,986
-Come on, give me a cigarette!
-No way!

24
00:01:49,195 --> 00:01:50,655
Mark, wait!

25
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:52,824
Catch me, I'll give you one.

26
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:54,659
I can't run that fast.

27
00:01:58,872 --> 00:02:00,289
Catch me!

28
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:02,959
Wait up!

29
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:04,835
You'll never get your smoke.

30
00:02:05,044 --> 00:02:08,839
-We're not supposed to go in the woods.
-Go home, I'll smoke them!

31
00:02:10,174 --> 00:02:11,843
Come get me!

32
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:26,525
Come on, Ricky! Catch me.

33
00:02:26,734 --> 00:02:28,778
Come on, give me one.

34
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:30,696
No way, pal!

35
00:02:30,904 --> 00:02:32,364
I'll tell Mom.

36
00:02:33,074 --> 00:02:34,366
Tattletale.

37
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:35,993
You know the deal.

38
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:38,788
-If I tell, you'll kick my ass.
-That's right.

39
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:42,876
-If you smoke more than one a day....
-You'll kick my ass again.

40
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:44,043
That's right.

41
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:47,504
-How many do you smoke a day?
-Only one. I'm smart.

42
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:49,548
Will one a day kill me?

43
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:53,052
Not soon, but any more than that,
you'd be in deep shit.

44
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:55,680
-How many does Mom smoke?
-40.

45
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:57,307
And what about Dad?

46
00:02:57,557 --> 00:02:58,892
A hundred a day.

47
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,560
He's going to die soon.

48
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:02,729
I wish. Sit here.

49
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:10,154
Don't try to swallow the smoke yet.
You're not ready for that.

50
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:13,198
You'll just choke and puke
all over the place.

51
00:03:18,121 --> 00:03:20,081
Suck a little and blow.

52
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:29,215
I told you not to swallow the smoke.

53
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:34,054
This is easy.

54
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:36,431
You look like you're going to puke.

55
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:38,432
Do not.

56
00:03:54,324 --> 00:03:55,909
Where is he going?

57
00:04:10,632 --> 00:04:11,967
What's he doing?

58
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:23,897
Damn!

59
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:44,167
Damn. Goddamn.

60
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:49,840
Son of a bitch!

61
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:53,886
Jesus Christ,
he's trying to kill himself.

62
00:04:54,053 --> 00:04:55,263
How do you know?

63
00:04:55,513 --> 00:04:57,014
I seen it on TV once.

64
00:04:57,223 --> 00:05:01,477
-Why would he want to kill himself?
-How would I know, stupid?

65
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:04,605
-Let's get the hell out of here.
-No.

66
00:05:04,855 --> 00:05:08,276
You stay here. Okay?
lf you move, I'll kick your ass.

67
00:05:08,526 --> 00:05:10,027
What are you going to do?

68
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,354
Come on, let's go.

69
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:46,899
-We must make sure he's okay.
-Is he dead?

70
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:48,067
I don't know.

71
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,581
Nothing works. Nothing works!

72
00:06:08,755 --> 00:06:10,756
He is crazy as hell.

73
00:06:16,513 --> 00:06:18,682
-Let's go, please.
-We can't.

74
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:22,519
If he kills himself and we know
about it, we can be in trouble.

75
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:24,062
We won't tell no one.

76
00:06:24,772 --> 00:06:26,356
Just let him die.

77
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:29,110
-We're not leaving until I say so.
-Stay down.

78
00:06:29,318 --> 00:06:30,277
Stupid.

79
00:06:59,516 --> 00:07:00,433
Bastard!

80
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:04,146
Bastard!

81
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:10,152
Get in!

82
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:21,830
Don't you touch that damn door!

83
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,505
Sorry, kid.

84
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:33,176
You had to be a cute ass.

85
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:37,347
Had to stick your dirty little nose
in my business, didn't you?

86
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,351
So we should die together.

87
00:07:42,227 --> 00:07:43,520
Just you and me.

88
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:46,147
Off to la-la land.

89
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,986
Sweet dreams.

90
00:07:55,406 --> 00:07:56,366
Want the gun?

91
00:07:58,076 --> 00:08:00,036
-Why you looking at it?
-I wasn't.

92
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:01,914
Don't you lie to me!

93
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:06,334
I'm crazy.
If you lie, I'll kill you.

94
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:08,462
Please don't kill me, sir.

95
00:08:08,712 --> 00:08:11,214
I got my mom and brother
to take care of.

96
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:12,549
I give you a choice.

97
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:14,427
I blow your brains out...

98
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,637
...and end it now...

99
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:19,891
...or we could wait
and let the gas do it.

100
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:21,892
You decide.

101
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,033
What's your name?

102
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,245
Mark Sway.

103
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,123
Jerome Clifford.

104
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:44,874
Attorney at law.

105
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:48,712
Since we're both tired right now...

106
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:51,715
...you can call me Romey.

107
00:08:55,595 --> 00:08:56,678
Listen.

108
00:08:56,928 --> 00:08:58,222
Hear that bird?

109
00:08:58,597 --> 00:09:02,894
I drove from New Orleans to hear
those stupid birds. Grew up here.

110
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:06,939
I played in these woods.

111
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:08,941
Now I'll die here too.

112
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:13,279
Why are you doing this?

113
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:15,698
Because if I don't kill myself...

114
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:16,992
...he will.

115
00:09:17,742 --> 00:09:18,450
Who?

116
00:09:18,702 --> 00:09:19,535
The Blade.

117
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:22,956
Barry "The Blade" Muldano.

118
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:27,543
Why does this Blade guy
want to kill you?

119
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,515
I know where
the proverbial body is buried.

120
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:41,182
Whose body?

121
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:49,817
See, my client...

122
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,487
...killed Senator Boyd Boyette...

123
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:53,904
...and hid the body.

124
00:09:54,154 --> 00:09:57,116
So now my client,
he wants to kill me.

125
00:09:57,992 --> 00:10:01,454
You know where the body's buried?
It's buried....

126
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:03,790
He hid the body....

127
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:13,382
He's still buried there.

128
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:18,680
The FBI dug up half of New Orleans.
They haven't found it and never will.

129
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:26,022
Yeah, Mark, go for it.

130
00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:27,523
Yeah, Mark, go ahead!

131
00:10:27,732 --> 00:10:30,317
Go ahead.
Pull the trigger. Yeah!

132
00:10:31,193 --> 00:10:32,152
Pull it!

133
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:37,824
Pull the goddamn trigger! Pull it!

134
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:42,330
Pull it!

135
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,583
Nifty piece, huh?

136
00:10:48,877 --> 00:10:50,755
Hell, I don't even know if it works.

137
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:05,854
Let's see.

138
00:11:09,441 --> 00:11:10,233
It works!

139
00:11:11,943 --> 00:11:13,153
It works! Come here!

140
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:23,038
Son of a bitch!

141
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:33,049
Where are you?

142
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:35,384
Goddamn kid!

143
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:43,434
Come back here, kid!

144
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:48,607
If The Blade finds out what I told you,
he's going to kill you anyway!

145
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,277
You hear me, kid?

146
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:57,907
Where are you?

147
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:13,924
Stop!

148
00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:15,468
Stop!

149
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:32,110
Put my drink on my bill.

150
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,461
Dance with me.

151
00:13:06,187 --> 00:13:07,521
I've waited half an hour.

152
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,400
Where's Romey?
The Feds are on my ass.

153
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:11,985
Mr. Muldano.

154
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:15,821
I don't know.
He hasn't been in here all day.

155
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:18,366
Now, Claudette...

156
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:22,036
..."God hates a liar."
That's what my mother always said.

157
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:26,499
I'm not lying. I haven't seen him.
I don't know where he is.

158
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,710
You know, Claudette...

159
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,004
...you're a very pretty woman.

160
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:34,383
Thank you, Mr. Muldano.

161
00:13:37,761 --> 00:13:39,847
You want to stay pretty, don't you?

162
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:44,393
I'm just a secretary.

163
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:47,605
Honest to God,
I don't know where he is.

164
00:13:48,063 --> 00:13:51,025
-He doesn't always tell me.
-Put your hand in here.

165
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:54,027
Put your hand in here!

166
00:13:54,404 --> 00:13:55,696
I don't--

167
00:13:55,905 --> 00:13:58,074
I don't know. Honest.

168
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:01,578
Put your hand in.

169
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,245
Come on.

170
00:14:04,288 --> 00:14:06,874
Please. I don't know where he is.

171
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,053
You know, I believe
you really didn't know where he was.

172
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:26,102
What's inside?

173
00:14:32,276 --> 00:14:34,570
-There you go.
-Watch yourself.

174
00:14:40,827 --> 00:14:41,953
What's up, kid?

175
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:46,291
What are you so scared of?

176
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:48,417
Did you have a bad dream?

177
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:51,504
You're scaring your mama.
Get your thumb out.

178
00:14:55,842 --> 00:14:57,260
Come on, baby.

179
00:14:58,678 --> 00:15:02,474
Where have you been?
What is wrong with your brother?

180
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:05,894
What have you done now?
What the hell is going on?

181
00:15:06,144 --> 00:15:08,980
-Boy witnessed a suicide, ma'am.
-He what?

182
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:11,316
Me and Ricky was just...

183
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:13,819
...out in the woods playing....

184
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:16,572
This guy was dead
with a gun in his mouth.

185
00:15:16,864 --> 00:15:18,407
Oh, my dear God!

186
00:15:18,657 --> 00:15:21,077
And I ran home and called 911.

187
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:22,619
What happened to Ricky?

188
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:26,164
He just laid on the bed
and started sucking his thumb.

189
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:30,086
This is Sgt. Hardy.
We need paramedics at Sway's trailer.

190
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:32,421
This boy needs to be hospitalized.

191
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:34,173
I have no health insurance.

192
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:37,051
St. Peter's will take indigent cases.

193
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:40,889
Just pack up some things
in a bag for the hospital.

194
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:48,688
You telling the truth?

195
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:50,398
About what you saw?

196
00:15:50,731 --> 00:15:52,442
Don't you believe me?

197
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:54,903
I didn't say I didn't believe you.

198
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:56,988
It just seems strange.

199
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:59,992
You called 911,
but you wouldn't leave your name.

200
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:03,453
I was scared.
It was the first dead guy I ever saw.

201
00:16:03,703 --> 00:16:06,707
Then why'd you sneak back
and hide in the woods?

202
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,877
I don't know.
I just wanted to see, I guess.

203
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:13,839
Did you talk to the man...

204
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:15,716
...before he killed himself?

205
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,135
No, I never talked to him.

206
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:20,888
Does "Jerome Clifford"
mean anything to you?

207
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,603
I found some fresh cigarette butts...

208
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:28,145
...near the body.

209
00:16:28,395 --> 00:16:30,732
Same brand as your mom smokes.

210
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,859
Somehow I can't see you
finding the body and then...

211
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:35,737
...deciding to have a cigarette.

212
00:16:36,738 --> 00:16:41,117
Look, Officer, we was walking through
the woods when we found Romey dead.

213
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:43,161
-That's all.
-Who's Romey?

214
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:47,082
-That's the guy's name, isn't it?
-I said, "Jerome Clifford."

215
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,376
Whoever heard of the name Romey?

216
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:11,107
I'm Dr. Greenway, is this your son?

217
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:13,109
-Yes.
-What's his name?

218
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:17,947
-How long has he been this way?
-I didn't find him, my boy Mark did.

219
00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:20,283
You found him, Mark? Ricky?

220
00:17:20,992 --> 00:17:24,120
Jerome R. Clifford, attorney,
was found dead...

221
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:27,791
...in an apparent suicide
outside Memphis just hours ago.

222
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:31,420
The famed Mafia lawyer
was to defend the alleged hitman...

223
00:17:31,795 --> 00:17:34,048
...Barry "The Blade" Muldano...

224
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:37,843
...in the notorious case
of still-missing Louisiana senator...

225
00:17:38,093 --> 00:17:40,970
...Boyd Boyette, now presumed dead.

226
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:44,933
It'd be tough to build a case
against Muldano without a body...

227
00:17:45,142 --> 00:17:47,812
...but surely Clifford's death
will mean more delays.

228
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:49,981
As one informed source tells me...

229
00:17:50,189 --> 00:17:53,233
...the plot thickens
for U.S. Attorney Roy Foltrigg.

230
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:56,070
No body, no case, no conviction.

231
00:17:56,362 --> 00:17:59,991
That means no front-page pictures
that Foltrigg likes so much.

232
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,995
No CNN interviews,
no speedy ascent to Capitol Hill.

233
00:18:04,204 --> 00:18:05,997
Sorry, Reverend Roy.

234
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:07,999
I never liked that old cow.

235
00:18:08,207 --> 00:18:09,500
We're here, Roy.

236
00:18:13,505 --> 00:18:17,843
He tried it first with a hose attached
to the tailpipe, but it didn't work.

237
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,429
-He was probably too stoned.
-He was full of downers and whiskey.

238
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,477
I guess he figured he'd swallow a bullet
for dessert. Cheap snub-nosed .38.

239
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:28,019
Definitely a suicide.

240
00:18:28,228 --> 00:18:30,438
Damn him. Two days ago I told him:

241
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,777
"I have enough evidence
to put your fat ass on the stand."

242
00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:37,112
I was bullshitting of course. But...

243
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:40,741
...I didn't know he'd get so nervous
he'd kill himself.

244
00:18:41,034 --> 00:18:42,994
He knew where the body was.

245
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:46,498
He'll never tell us now.
Without that body we have no case.

246
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:49,541
-How's the weather in Memphis?
-It's hot, Roy.

247
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:53,213
Sprite?

248
00:18:59,594 --> 00:19:00,846
What happened?

249
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:03,473
I got in a fight at school.

250
00:19:03,723 --> 00:19:06,059
It's summer. There's no school.

251
00:19:06,393 --> 00:19:08,436
I meant, a kid from my school.

252
00:19:08,728 --> 00:19:09,562
Who?

253
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:12,316
-Why?
-Why? Because I'm a cop.

254
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:14,692
It's my job to ask questions.

255
00:19:15,402 --> 00:19:17,237
Besides, your story's full of holes.

256
00:19:18,446 --> 00:19:21,116
I believe you were in that car
before Clifford died.

257
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,451
What does "indigent" mean?

258
00:19:23,744 --> 00:19:24,870
Indigent?

259
00:19:25,913 --> 00:19:27,080
It means "poor."

260
00:19:27,456 --> 00:19:30,250
Like you and your mother
and your little brother.

261
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,337
So tell the truth...

262
00:19:32,587 --> 00:19:34,713
...hope this snaps him out of it.

263
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:36,048
Otherwise...

264
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:38,092
...he could lie in some...

265
00:19:38,301 --> 00:19:41,596
...institution for dirt-poor
crazy people...

266
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:44,057
...with padded walls...

267
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:46,058
...and cockroaches...

268
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:47,518
...chained to some...

269
00:19:47,768 --> 00:19:50,230
...filthy bed, with snakes....

270
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,275
I'm Karen.

271
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,777
Come with me.

272
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,499
-We'll have to watch him.
-What will you do?

273
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,962
We'll just watch for now.
Sometimes a night's sleep...

274
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,631
...and the next morning they wake up.

275
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,301
-His reflexes seem to be good.
-That's good.

276
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,470
Ricky's real sick.

277
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,388
What's wrong?

278
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,516
Post-traumatic stress syndrome.

279
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,645
Sometimes people see
something they can't deal with.

280
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,980
I'm always telling Mark...

281
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:34,318
..."No horror movies.
No scary comics."

282
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,611
Not for Ricky.

283
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,323
He's always been tender that way.

284
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:40,490
Easy, now.

285
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,409
You try to protect them,
but it's so bad out there.

286
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,913
Why don't you get some rest?
Just lie down and rest.

287
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,999
There's nothing more you can do.
We'll watch him.

288
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,796
You've had a rough day.
Just lie down. Stay with him.

289
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,230
Bad injury. What happened?

290
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,525
Car wreck. Got hit by a truck.
Nut ran a stop sign.

291
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:19,530
My name's Gill Beale. I'm a lawyer.
You got a problem, I can fix it.

292
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,450
I specialize in car wrecks.
Now, let's see what you got here.

293
00:21:23,702 --> 00:21:27,204
-Broken leg, concussion, broken ribs--
-And a broken collarbone.

294
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:28,206
Great.

295
00:21:28,456 --> 00:21:31,251
I can get you $600,000.
We'll file suit tomorrow.

296
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:36,882
Did I say 6? Six is just for starters.
Check me out.

297
00:21:37,132 --> 00:21:39,176
Call up Gill Beale, he's for real.

298
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:42,304
More lawyers around this place
than there are doctors.

299
00:21:42,554 --> 00:21:44,222
Don't be that way.

300
00:21:44,431 --> 00:21:46,641
I'll outrun that little buggy of yours.

301
00:22:05,662 --> 00:22:07,788
Wait till you get a load of this guy.

302
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,752
Mr. Foltrigg, Jason McThune, FBI.
Welcome to Memphis...

303
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:14,921
...home of the King.

304
00:22:15,171 --> 00:22:16,422
What do you know?

305
00:22:16,672 --> 00:22:17,924
Kid's name is Mark Sway.

306
00:22:18,175 --> 00:22:22,262
He said that he and his brother just
stumbled on the body in the woods.

307
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,349
-Then called the cops. He's lying.
-Why?

308
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:30,437
We got a set of his fingerprints. They
match prints that were inside the car.

309
00:22:30,688 --> 00:22:34,775
He was in that car with Clifford
before he died, for quite a while.

310
00:22:34,983 --> 00:22:36,443
There's a lot of prints.

311
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:38,278
-Why would he lie?
-He's scared.

312
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:40,948
And he's a kid. They always lie.

313
00:22:41,198 --> 00:22:45,286
And maybe Romey Clifford told him
something he knows he shouldn't know.

314
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:48,540
People hate to die with secrets.
That's good work.

315
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,792
Thank you very much.
I'm going to keep it up, believe me.

316
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:53,002
Listen...

317
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,550
...I'm sick of chasing Elvis sightings.
Is there any room on your staff?

318
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,551
-Where do you want to go?
-Anywhere.

319
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:04,473
Do something with your hair first.
Meantime, I want to talk to Mark.

320
00:23:04,723 --> 00:23:06,099
Right away, sir.

321
00:23:11,145 --> 00:23:13,607
Dr. Greenway wants to see you.

322
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:16,652
How old are you?

323
00:23:16,902 --> 00:23:18,987
24. Why?

324
00:23:19,237 --> 00:23:20,656
Are you married?

325
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:22,532
Sometimes.

326
00:23:25,577 --> 00:23:28,289
I don't know nothing,
but he looks better to me.

327
00:23:28,497 --> 00:23:31,667
He'll be fine if we get him home
in his own bed.

328
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:33,877
I don't know why you just can't...

329
00:23:34,252 --> 00:23:36,755
...give him some medicine or something.

330
00:23:37,006 --> 00:23:40,218
-I have to go to work.
-Mrs. Sway, listen to me.

331
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:42,303
Our trailer rents by the week.

332
00:23:42,512 --> 00:23:43,679
Listen to me.

333
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,517
Right now, it's as if Ricky
is in a dark place...

334
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:50,603
...and trying to find a way out.
What's important...

335
00:23:50,853 --> 00:23:54,607
...what's very important is that
when he finds that way out...

336
00:23:54,858 --> 00:23:59,487
...the first thing he sees is your face.
Let's hope it'll only takes a few days.

337
00:24:00,447 --> 00:24:04,367
There goes another job.
Must be setting some kind of record.

338
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:08,956
-I'll call your boss. He'll understand.
-My boss runs a sweatshop.

339
00:24:09,206 --> 00:24:12,376
He will not send flowers.
He will not understand.

340
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:15,379
You could take shifts.
Perhaps the father could come.

341
00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:19,049
Ex-father!
And you keep him away from Ricky!

342
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:20,343
Hush!

343
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,428
Okay, mom. I'm sorry.

344
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:28,351
I don't know if you've seen this,
but there are policemen downstairs...

345
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:30,102
...and reporters and...

346
00:24:30,394 --> 00:24:32,354
...the FBI is coming to see Mark.

347
00:24:32,563 --> 00:24:37,110
I don't want to talk to them. I'll wind
up like Ricky if they don't let me be!

348
00:24:37,568 --> 00:24:38,653
They won't go away.

349
00:24:38,903 --> 00:24:41,824
Look, I don't give a flying shit
about the FBI!

350
00:24:42,074 --> 00:24:44,826
You are getting on my last nerve.
Now sit down...

351
00:24:45,076 --> 00:24:47,413
...and hush up!
I don't know what to do.

352
00:24:47,663 --> 00:24:49,873
-Can I see you outside?
-I'm going crazy.

353
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:53,960
Tell me to wait for my boy to....
Or some crap.

354
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,425
This boy!

355
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:02,052
I'm sorry.

356
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,182
I'm sorry too.

357
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:09,768
I'll think of something
to get us out of this, I promise.

358
00:25:10,018 --> 00:25:13,313
You and Ricky just found
that guy dead...

359
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:15,232
...right?

360
00:25:16,526 --> 00:25:19,320
There's nothing you ain't telling me,
is there?

361
00:25:20,864 --> 00:25:23,741
Dr. Greenway wants
to start you on Valium.

362
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,410
Those cost extra?

363
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:28,038
Don't worry about it. Just take these.

364
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:29,623
-Both of them?
-Yes.

365
00:25:29,873 --> 00:25:31,124
You'll feel better.

366
00:25:31,374 --> 00:25:32,668
Don't go far.

367
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:36,547
FBI, huh?

368
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,593
I hear that they're sending
the Reverend Roy Foltrigg himself.

369
00:25:41,843 --> 00:25:43,596
That's bad. That's....

370
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:44,888
You know...

371
00:25:45,138 --> 00:25:46,557
...that the FBI...

372
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:49,685
...puts kids in jail
if they break the law?

373
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:53,856
And if a kid has been
involved in a murder...

374
00:25:54,147 --> 00:25:55,650
...they got a special little...

375
00:25:55,857 --> 00:25:57,567
...kid-size electric chair.

376
00:25:57,819 --> 00:26:00,655
I saw it once.
It was about...so high.

377
00:26:01,321 --> 00:26:05,576
When somebody gets electrocuted,
the current is so strong...

378
00:26:05,826 --> 00:26:09,205
...it makes the blood in the veins boil.

379
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:14,293
Fries you like a piece of bacon.

380
00:26:14,836 --> 00:26:17,213
You're the only pig around here.

381
00:26:18,214 --> 00:26:19,716
We'll see you later.

382
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,812
-Are you here to question Mark?
-I beg your pardon?

383
00:26:35,274 --> 00:26:38,860
Are you here to improve
your own position regarding the case?

384
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:42,823
My real interest is to see justice done.
You all know that about me.

385
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:24,574
You ain't going in here by yourself.
What do you want, boy?

386
00:27:24,825 --> 00:27:26,159
I need to see Mr. Beale.

387
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,996
-Where are your parents?
-Where are yours?

388
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:30,331
Are you injured?

389
00:27:30,623 --> 00:27:32,082
Do I look injured?

390
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,335
We only do injuries.

391
00:27:34,627 --> 00:27:38,297
I'll just go get hit by a truck
and come back.

392
00:27:40,257 --> 00:27:41,717
You shut up too.

393
00:27:50,851 --> 00:27:52,103
Yes?

394
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:53,730
Hell, no.

395
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:06,493
I'm going to pick up something to eat
and then swing by the post office.

396
00:28:15,002 --> 00:28:16,503
When's your boss returning?

397
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:18,130
May I help you?

398
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,134
-No, I need to see Reggie Love.
-Why, may I ask?

399
00:28:22,385 --> 00:28:24,470
That's between me and Mr. Love.

400
00:28:25,388 --> 00:28:27,014
I'm Reggie Love.

401
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,641
Shit. A woman lawyer. Great.

402
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,603
I think so. Why is it
you think you want a lawyer?

403
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:35,648
I don't want a lawyer.
I hate lawyers.

404
00:28:35,898 --> 00:28:38,734
Every lawyer I ever had
shafted me and my mom.

405
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:42,864
I said I need a lawyer.
But I don't know about no woman.

406
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:46,493
Well, this lawyer that shafted you,
what was her name?

407
00:28:46,743 --> 00:28:48,537
It wasn't no her, it was a he.

408
00:28:49,287 --> 00:28:50,038
Right.

409
00:28:51,832 --> 00:28:54,919
Well, why is it that you think
you need a lawyer?

410
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:56,504
Because I'm Mark Sway.

411
00:28:56,754 --> 00:28:57,671
So?

412
00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:01,634
The kid who found the dead guy.
I'm famous. Don't you read the paper?

413
00:29:01,843 --> 00:29:03,760
You haven't answered my question.

414
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:07,514
Because I'm supposed to talk to
Reverend Roy in 10 minutes.

415
00:29:07,765 --> 00:29:09,017
Reverend Roy Foltrigg?

416
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:10,809
Why is he called that?

417
00:29:11,102 --> 00:29:15,439
He quotes the scriptures in court
and knows the Bible better than God.

418
00:29:15,732 --> 00:29:16,691
He wins a lot?

419
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:18,026
Always.

420
00:29:18,276 --> 00:29:21,863
Why can't people leave me alone?
Some sweaty guy kills himself--

421
00:29:22,113 --> 00:29:23,531
Why'd you lie to the police?

422
00:29:23,781 --> 00:29:26,117
-I didn't.
-It says here in the paper.

423
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:27,868
You found Clifford dead.

424
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,078
I did.

425
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,209
Dead men don't sweat...

426
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:35,752
...now, do they?

427
00:29:43,218 --> 00:29:45,262
If you was my lawyer...

428
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,058
...and I told you something,
could you repeat it?

429
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:52,102
No. What is it you want to tell me?

430
00:29:53,228 --> 00:29:55,063
That Clifford guy came...

431
00:29:55,314 --> 00:29:58,276
...driving up in his big black car
and me and Ricky...

432
00:29:58,526 --> 00:30:00,068
...snuck up to watch...

433
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,321
...and that Clifford got out...

434
00:30:02,571 --> 00:30:05,491
...put a gun in his mouth,
and blew the back of his head out.

435
00:30:05,783 --> 00:30:07,869
So you did see Clifford alive.

436
00:30:09,495 --> 00:30:11,372
Why'd you lie to the police?

437
00:30:11,664 --> 00:30:14,459
I don't know.
I was just scared, I guess.

438
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:18,045
My brother's in a coma
and my mom might lose her job.

439
00:30:18,421 --> 00:30:22,175
The FBI's after me but
I don't know nothing. You'd lie too.

440
00:30:23,384 --> 00:30:26,472
You're right.
You do need a lawyer, Mark Sway.

441
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:31,477
There are male lawyers down the hall.
Want a recommendation?

442
00:30:32,436 --> 00:30:34,062
How many cases have you won?

443
00:30:34,438 --> 00:30:35,647
More than I lost.

444
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,566
How much do you cost?

445
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:39,067
How much you got?

446
00:30:56,837 --> 00:30:59,172
9.32.
Our boy has arrived.

447
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:15,272
Thank God your mother,
my sister, is dead.

448
00:31:15,647 --> 00:31:18,692
Having a son this stupid
would have killed her for sure.

449
00:31:20,152 --> 00:31:23,030
I told you not to hit Boyette.
You did.

450
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:27,368
I told you not to tell Romey
too much. You did.

451
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,580
I hope it hurt that fat bastard.
I hope that bullet was slow.

452
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:34,542
I hope he felt his head
pull right off his face!

453
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:38,504
Two kids found him,
maybe before he finished the job.

454
00:31:38,754 --> 00:31:40,423
I know, I seen it on TV.

455
00:31:40,673 --> 00:31:42,299
He might have talked.

456
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:46,012
Tell me Boyette's body is well-hidden.

457
00:31:46,262 --> 00:31:47,806
The cops won't find it.

458
00:31:48,932 --> 00:31:50,225
Move the body.

459
00:31:50,516 --> 00:31:52,310
I will, Uncle Johnny.

460
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,564
Only I can't, right now.

461
00:31:56,022 --> 00:31:56,981
Why?

462
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:00,819
Where it's at...

463
00:32:01,027 --> 00:32:03,989
...the body, the cops
are swarming all over the place.

464
00:32:04,698 --> 00:32:06,866
Don't worry, they won't find it!

465
00:32:07,116 --> 00:32:11,413
If that kid knows anything,
he's not talking or I wouldn't be here.

466
00:32:11,788 --> 00:32:14,208
I'll go to Memphis
and take care of that kid.

467
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:15,875
I'll tell you what to do.

468
00:32:16,084 --> 00:32:18,421
Just sit on your dumb ass.

469
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:23,092
I want you in Memphis.

470
00:32:28,306 --> 00:32:29,348
Come.

471
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,104
You must be Mark.

472
00:32:35,814 --> 00:32:38,108
Jason McThune, Memphis FBI.

473
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:41,028
This is Larry Trumann,
New Orleans FBI.

474
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:44,364
Thomas Fink, Assistant
U.S. Attorney and Mr. Foltrigg...

475
00:32:45,574 --> 00:32:46,658
...U.S. Attorney...

476
00:32:47,325 --> 00:32:49,077
...both from southern Louisiana.

477
00:32:49,578 --> 00:32:50,579
Sit down.

478
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,916
Right over there.

479
00:32:57,961 --> 00:32:59,713
Where is your mother?

480
00:33:00,256 --> 00:33:02,216
She's with my little brother.

481
00:33:02,591 --> 00:33:04,927
She can't leave in case he wakes up.

482
00:33:07,846 --> 00:33:10,099
We could hold this off
for a few days.

483
00:33:10,307 --> 00:33:13,060
No, Mark!
Let's talk for a few minutes.

484
00:33:16,981 --> 00:33:17,940
Nervous?

485
00:33:18,483 --> 00:33:19,400
A little.

486
00:33:21,528 --> 00:33:22,904
Do I need a lawyer?

487
00:33:23,113 --> 00:33:24,113
What for?

488
00:33:24,364 --> 00:33:27,199
-To protect my rights.
-You watch too much TV.

489
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,036
We just want to ask questions.
Trust us.

490
00:33:30,287 --> 00:33:33,289
Lawyers just get in the way.
They object to everything.

491
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,626
What if I don't answer your questions?

492
00:33:35,876 --> 00:33:38,962
We might have to take you downtown.
Your mother too.

493
00:33:39,212 --> 00:33:40,463
Will she get in trouble?

494
00:33:40,713 --> 00:33:43,425
-Maybe.
-Ever hear of obstruction of justice?

495
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:45,677
It's a federal offense.

496
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,556
It means if a man knows about a crime
and withholds information...

497
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:53,060
...from the FBI or the police,
he might be punished.

498
00:33:53,351 --> 00:33:55,270
Sent to jail or something.

499
00:33:55,563 --> 00:33:59,442
So if I don't answer your questions,
I could go to jail?

500
00:34:00,234 --> 00:34:01,277
Maybe.

501
00:34:04,363 --> 00:34:07,033
If you was in my place,
wouldn't you want a lawyer?

502
00:34:07,242 --> 00:34:10,119
No. They're a pain in the ass.
You don't need a lawyer.

503
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:11,371
Pain in the ass?

504
00:34:12,747 --> 00:34:14,290
Aren't you a lawyer?

505
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:18,086
Clifford wasn't really dead
when you found him, was he?

506
00:34:18,336 --> 00:34:19,253
He was.

507
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,006
We know you were in that car.

508
00:34:23,049 --> 00:34:24,009
See that?

509
00:34:26,261 --> 00:34:28,514
You and Romey had a nice long chat.

510
00:34:28,764 --> 00:34:31,808
What did you talk about?
Life? Love...

511
00:34:33,769 --> 00:34:35,813
...or where bodies are buried?

512
00:34:36,522 --> 00:34:38,023
I must go to the bathroom.

513
00:34:38,232 --> 00:34:40,108
Just answer the question first.

514
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:42,069
I've got to go bad. Please?

515
00:34:42,361 --> 00:34:43,487
You better go.

516
00:34:47,616 --> 00:34:49,201
"You don't need no lawyer."

517
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:52,621
You all know, that boy
is about ready to tell all.

518
00:34:52,872 --> 00:34:55,207
-You know where Muldano is?
-We follow him.

519
00:34:55,457 --> 00:34:57,042
Grab him so he don't skip town.

520
00:34:57,294 --> 00:34:59,379
-The office.
-Don't mark up his face.

521
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:01,047
We'll see reporters here.

522
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:05,051
Wait till we grab Muldano.
I want to make sure he can't make bail.

523
00:35:05,385 --> 00:35:08,888
Did you get my makeup off the plane?
I need pancake number 17.

524
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:11,933
Doughnuts. Give me the telephone.
Press loves doughnuts.

525
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:13,893
See what you can do.

526
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:15,812
Where will we put me?

527
00:35:16,104 --> 00:35:19,817
I look best in front of these glass
bricks, behind lots of microphones.

528
00:35:20,108 --> 00:35:21,861
That always looks nice.

529
00:35:22,444 --> 00:35:25,488
-I'll call you back.
-Come in, Mark. Polite kid.

530
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,948
He's a good boy.

531
00:35:30,911 --> 00:35:32,746
-Keep your seats.
-We're in a meeting.

532
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:34,499
You're in the wrong room.

533
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:38,169
I don't think so. My name is
Reggie Love, I'm an attorney...

534
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:40,129
...and I represent Mark Sway.

535
00:35:41,171 --> 00:35:43,925
May I see some I.D., please?

536
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:46,260
When did he hire you?

537
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,347
I don't think that's really
any of your business.

538
00:35:49,597 --> 00:35:54,311
Forgive us, Ms. Love. You're so pretty.
How could you be mistaken for a lawyer?

539
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,563
Please, call me Reggie...

540
00:35:58,148 --> 00:35:59,107
...Roy.

541
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:03,278
Please, sit down.

542
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:08,200
Did you attempt to interrogate my client
outside the presence of his mother...

543
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,284
...Jason?

544
00:36:10,952 --> 00:36:13,539
He tells me you did... Lawrence.

545
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:15,499
Well, he's confused.

546
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:19,128
We assumed his mother was coming.
Where were you during this?

547
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:21,296
That's not really relevant.

548
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,133
Did you advise him
to talk to an attorney...

549
00:36:24,342 --> 00:36:25,384
...Thomas?

550
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:30,556
Remember, once, Larry? Mark
said something, or I did, about TV...

551
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,141
...and then...

552
00:36:32,392 --> 00:36:35,228
...Mark said he might need a lawyer...

553
00:36:35,478 --> 00:36:38,147
...and we thought he was just joking.

554
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,567
So he never asked
if he needed a lawyer?

555
00:36:41,817 --> 00:36:43,027
I don't remember that.

556
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,239
Did you advise him of his rights?

557
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,449
What for?

558
00:36:47,824 --> 00:36:50,494
He's not a criminal.
We just wanted to question him.

559
00:36:50,744 --> 00:36:54,498
So you did attempt to interrogate him
without his mother and counsel?

560
00:36:54,748 --> 00:36:55,749
Definitely not.

561
00:36:55,999 --> 00:36:57,041
No way.

562
00:37:00,504 --> 00:37:01,672
Bullshit.

563
00:37:01,922 --> 00:37:06,593
I'd tread carefully. We know your
client lied about being in that car.

564
00:37:06,844 --> 00:37:10,306
I think that's a bit of the pot
calling the kettle black.

565
00:37:13,101 --> 00:37:14,185
Do I need a lawyer?

566
00:37:14,602 --> 00:37:15,436
What for?

567
00:37:15,686 --> 00:37:17,146
To protect my rights.

568
00:37:17,355 --> 00:37:18,522
You watch too much TV.

569
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:21,150
We just want to ask questions.
Trust us.

570
00:37:21,526 --> 00:37:25,196
Lawyers just get in the way.
They object to everything.

571
00:37:25,864 --> 00:37:26,822
You wired him.

572
00:37:27,865 --> 00:37:29,241
Nothing personal, Lawrence.

573
00:37:31,244 --> 00:37:34,956
You tried to interrogate a child
without his mother.

574
00:37:35,248 --> 00:37:38,459
He specifically asked you if he needed
a lawyer and you said no...

575
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,672
...stating as a reason that lawyers
are a pain in the ass.

576
00:37:42,547 --> 00:37:47,427
I'd like to confer with my client
and meet you in my office tomorrow at 3.

577
00:37:48,262 --> 00:37:49,930
If I need anything from you...

578
00:37:50,388 --> 00:37:53,225
...Iike the truth, well,
I expect to get it.

579
00:37:53,976 --> 00:37:55,686
I catch you lying again...

580
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,855
...I'm going to use this tape.

581
00:37:59,815 --> 00:38:01,734
That's blackmail, Ms. Love.

582
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,444
Indict me, Reverend Roy.

583
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:09,491
Still want doughnuts?

584
00:38:09,743 --> 00:38:12,287
Shut up, McThune. Goddamn!

585
00:38:13,663 --> 00:38:16,415
-You want a cigarette?
-Oh, no, thanks. I just quit.

586
00:38:16,665 --> 00:38:19,419
There's been a mistake, ma'am.
We can't afford no lawyer.

587
00:38:19,669 --> 00:38:20,837
Don't worry about money.

588
00:38:21,087 --> 00:38:25,967
My pig boss fired me this morning.
My baby's in a coma and he fires me.

589
00:38:26,342 --> 00:38:27,511
Don't tell Mark.

590
00:38:27,761 --> 00:38:29,637
Just one day and he fired you?

591
00:38:30,305 --> 00:38:32,850
He sucks.
Wasn't much of a job anyways.

592
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,019
$5 an hour at a lamp factory.

593
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,979
How long you worked there?

594
00:38:39,774 --> 00:38:41,358
Six months.

595
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:44,904
-Lord, I can't keep my head on straight.
-You're doing fine.

596
00:38:46,321 --> 00:38:48,157
I like your ring.

597
00:38:48,533 --> 00:38:49,867
They real diamonds?

598
00:38:50,117 --> 00:38:52,662
Lord, no. It's semi-precious.

599
00:38:54,789 --> 00:38:56,248
You got kids?

600
00:38:58,626 --> 00:39:02,588
You must have been just a baby
when you started having your babies.

601
00:39:03,631 --> 00:39:05,466
I was just a dumb kid...

602
00:39:05,717 --> 00:39:07,343
...living in a dream.

603
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:13,100
All I ever wanted was a white house
with a walk-in closet.

604
00:39:13,641 --> 00:39:15,351
Ain't that stupid?

605
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,606
Having a dream is never stupid.

606
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,319
Take it one day at a time,
that's what I say.

607
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:35,789
Come on. You always
laugh at my air guitar.

608
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,417
Who's the best guitarist in the world?

609
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,545
Come on, Ricky, say it.

610
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,046
Yell it.

611
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,344
Look, Ricky, an Eskimo pissing.

612
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,148
Look at you.

613
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:06,320
I shouldn't have made you stay
in those woods. It's my fault.

614
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,616
But things are
going to be all right, I swear.

615
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:11,452
I've got us a lawyer...

616
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:14,997
...and even though she is a woman,
she's pretty darn good.

617
00:40:15,706 --> 00:40:18,000
She only costs a dollar too.

618
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,003
That's not it, though.

619
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,924
I'm really sorry.

620
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:27,051
I want to make it up to you.

621
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,261
I promise.

622
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:35,226
-What the hell are you doing?
-Slick Moeller, Memphis Press.

623
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:37,562
I wrote the story.
How's your brother?

624
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:40,064
-Get out!
-How is your brother?

625
00:40:40,314 --> 00:40:42,900
I just want to ask you a few questions.

626
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:46,821
-Did Clifford touch you any place?
-Shut up!

627
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:50,492
Did he tell you why
he was committing suicide?

628
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:52,911
-You better get out!
-Did he talk to you?

629
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:55,538
-Get out!
-I'll tell you what, I'll pay you.

630
00:40:58,459 --> 00:40:59,751
Are you all right?

631
00:41:21,191 --> 00:41:23,651
You Nance, private investigator?

632
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:27,447
Security specialist. Who's asking?

633
00:41:33,995 --> 00:41:36,456
My name is Gronke.
I need some fast work.

634
00:41:37,332 --> 00:41:38,457
Who referred you?

635
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:40,835
Sulari, New Orleans.

636
00:41:46,633 --> 00:41:50,554
I get $2,000 cash, non-refundable,
before I lift a finger.

637
00:41:58,396 --> 00:41:59,813
You like kids?

638
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,325
Why do you think Foltrigg was so....

639
00:42:10,909 --> 00:42:13,577
We're almost through.
Could you listen up?

640
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:15,496
Thank you.

641
00:42:15,746 --> 00:42:19,209
Why was Foltrigg so convinced
you were in Clifford's car?

642
00:42:19,543 --> 00:42:20,669
I don't know.

643
00:42:21,586 --> 00:42:23,838
As your attorney,
you have to trust me.

644
00:42:24,089 --> 00:42:28,218
I do trust you, Reggie.
I swear, I wasn't in that car.

645
00:42:34,224 --> 00:42:35,517
You like Led Zeppelin?

646
00:42:37,561 --> 00:42:39,355
Yeah. Do you?

647
00:42:39,605 --> 00:42:41,231
They were a great band.

648
00:42:41,607 --> 00:42:43,901
I bet you never heard of Led Zeppelin.

649
00:42:44,568 --> 00:42:47,946
You're probably a grownup
who says they like cool bands...

650
00:42:48,197 --> 00:42:51,700
...just to get close
to little punks like me.

651
00:42:53,244 --> 00:42:55,746
I think we've covered
just about everything.

652
00:42:58,165 --> 00:43:00,376
What's your favorite Zeppelin song?

653
00:43:01,919 --> 00:43:05,130
"Moby Dick," live version.
Bitching drum solo.

654
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:07,884
I'll pick you up tomorrow
about 2.30.

655
00:43:08,134 --> 00:43:12,054
What were the names
of their first 4 albums, Miss Groupie?

656
00:43:13,306 --> 00:43:18,228
Just tell Foltrigg what you told me and
that'll be the last we hear from him.

657
00:43:20,647 --> 00:43:23,400
What happens if you lie to the FBI?

658
00:43:24,109 --> 00:43:28,114
It's a federal offense.
In theory you could go to jail. Why?

659
00:43:28,446 --> 00:43:31,200
You weren't smoking
something besides cigarettes...

660
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,244
...in the woods, were you?

661
00:43:33,994 --> 00:43:35,954
Something you're not telling me?

662
00:43:36,205 --> 00:43:39,083
I'm positive I'm not keeping
something from you.

663
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:41,252
I was just curious.

664
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:47,842
The first Led Zeppelin albums
were called "I," "II" and "III."

665
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,636
The 4th, which is untitled...

666
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,597
...is generally referred to as "IV."

667
00:43:54,348 --> 00:43:55,892
See you tomorrow, groupie.

668
00:44:17,122 --> 00:44:18,165
Want one?

669
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:19,833
Elvis Pezley.

670
00:44:27,674 --> 00:44:29,176
I bet it's poisoned.

671
00:44:32,722 --> 00:44:33,890
She's funny.

672
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:37,351
My boy loves her.

673
00:44:43,691 --> 00:44:44,525
Sorry.

674
00:44:44,901 --> 00:44:46,819
My boy was in a car wreck.

675
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,363
Drunk driver.

676
00:44:48,821 --> 00:44:50,323
I don't know if he'll live.

677
00:44:50,573 --> 00:44:51,658
He's only 8.

678
00:44:51,908 --> 00:44:53,535
My brother's only 8.

679
00:44:54,244 --> 00:44:55,745
He's really sick.

680
00:44:55,995 --> 00:44:56,956
What's wrong?

681
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:59,041
He saw something, is all.

682
00:45:03,337 --> 00:45:06,048
Are you the kids
who saw that suicide guy?

683
00:45:07,257 --> 00:45:08,967
I seen it on TV.

684
00:45:10,386 --> 00:45:11,804
That must have been awful.

685
00:45:12,262 --> 00:45:14,097
How's your brother doing?

686
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:16,225
He just lays there.

687
00:45:17,601 --> 00:45:19,103
What a scary thing to see.

688
00:45:19,354 --> 00:45:20,563
I wasn't scared.

689
00:45:21,271 --> 00:45:25,068
He must have been out of his mind
to stick a gun in his mouth.

690
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:26,903
I mean, why?

691
00:45:29,113 --> 00:45:30,407
Was he acting weird...

692
00:45:30,698 --> 00:45:32,450
...or yelling crazy stuff?

693
00:45:34,786 --> 00:45:37,456
Maybe he said something scary
to your little brother.

694
00:45:37,747 --> 00:45:38,832
That could be.

695
00:45:39,874 --> 00:45:42,336
Well, dude, I got to go.

696
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,840
I hope your brother gets better.

697
00:47:13,888 --> 00:47:14,889
Where's Karen?

698
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:17,434
Off duty, hon. Get you anything?

699
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:19,394
Is there anything to eat?

700
00:47:19,644 --> 00:47:22,188
Cafeteria's open 24 hours.

701
00:47:31,156 --> 00:47:33,033
Can I have your autograph?

702
00:48:07,277 --> 00:48:08,862
Everything'll be fine.

703
00:48:18,789 --> 00:48:20,958
Now you listen to me, Mark Sway.

704
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:25,838
I don't know what Romey said,
but you repeat it to anyone...

705
00:48:26,046 --> 00:48:28,048
...including your lawyer,
I'll kill you.

706
00:48:28,299 --> 00:48:30,718
Talk to the Feds tomorrow,
I'll kill you.

707
00:48:30,968 --> 00:48:32,553
If you tell anyone about me...

708
00:48:32,803 --> 00:48:34,388
...I'll kill you slow.

709
00:48:34,638 --> 00:48:36,182
You understand me, big boy?

710
00:48:36,432 --> 00:48:38,101
You understand?

711
00:48:38,601 --> 00:48:40,644
Good. We have an understanding.

712
00:48:40,937 --> 00:48:41,938
I'll be watching.

713
00:48:54,492 --> 00:48:57,329
Everyone knew Muldano
and Boyette were in bed together.

714
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:02,625
Boyette got himself killed. He took
money from the Mafia to build a dump.

715
00:49:02,918 --> 00:49:05,670
When his constituents got pissed
he voted against it.

716
00:49:05,963 --> 00:49:08,507
-Enter Barry "The Blade."
-If Foltrigg can prove it.

717
00:49:08,757 --> 00:49:12,511
Why would Foltrigg bring in Muldano
if he didn't have Boyette's body?

718
00:49:12,762 --> 00:49:15,264
He's going to run for office.
What are we serving?

719
00:49:15,514 --> 00:49:17,933
-It's Thursday.
-Southern pecan.

720
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,521
Is something wrong?

721
00:49:22,772 --> 00:49:24,899
I ain't talking to the FBI today!

722
00:49:27,276 --> 00:49:28,527
You have to.

723
00:49:28,777 --> 00:49:30,321
They could subpoena you.

724
00:49:30,614 --> 00:49:33,199
Foltrigg is going to be here any minute.

725
00:49:33,449 --> 00:49:34,368
I said, no.

726
00:49:34,784 --> 00:49:37,536
As my lawyer,
you have to do what I tell you.

727
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:40,540
Reverend Roy, I saw you on TV!

728
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:42,709
This place is a dump.

729
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,378
You can say that again.

730
00:49:44,628 --> 00:49:45,837
My Lord.

731
00:49:47,631 --> 00:49:49,799
They are coming down the hall.

732
00:49:50,217 --> 00:49:52,886
Make them go away. Please!

733
00:49:54,012 --> 00:49:55,931
Stay here, out of sight.

734
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,852
Something's up. I don't get it,
but I will do it. Sit down.

735
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:06,066
Good afternoon, Ms. Love.

736
00:50:06,316 --> 00:50:08,444
Is young master Sway all ready?

737
00:50:08,736 --> 00:50:12,323
Roy, I'm sorry,
but the meeting's been canceled.

738
00:50:14,575 --> 00:50:15,493
Pardon?

739
00:50:15,743 --> 00:50:17,662
Let me debrief the child...

740
00:50:17,912 --> 00:50:20,999
...and give you a written statement.
He doesn't know anything.

741
00:50:21,249 --> 00:50:24,669
We must talk to him. We have
a set of confirmed fingerprints...

742
00:50:24,878 --> 00:50:27,422
...that put him inside
Jerome Clifford's car.

743
00:50:27,672 --> 00:50:29,632
What will we do about that?

744
00:50:31,051 --> 00:50:33,345
I think the big question is...

745
00:50:33,553 --> 00:50:35,763
...how did you match his fingerprints?

746
00:50:36,056 --> 00:50:38,016
Off a soda can at the hospital.

747
00:50:38,266 --> 00:50:41,352
Did you ask either Mark
or his mother before doing so?

748
00:50:41,604 --> 00:50:45,565
-So you invaded his privacy.
-We were trying to obtain evidence.

749
00:50:46,066 --> 00:50:48,194
For what?
So his prints were in the car!

750
00:50:48,444 --> 00:50:52,114
You have absolutely no proof
that he interacted with Clifford.

751
00:50:52,364 --> 00:50:55,868
The kid has a bruised cheekbone.
We found blood on Clifford's ring...

752
00:50:56,077 --> 00:50:57,412
...not his type.

753
00:50:57,787 --> 00:51:00,039
Let me guess.
Mark Sway's blood type.

754
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:01,499
That's right.

755
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,877
And how did you obtain
Mark's blood type?

756
00:51:05,127 --> 00:51:07,338
From his brother's hospital records.

757
00:51:07,588 --> 00:51:11,008
And how did you obtain
his brother's confidential records?

758
00:51:11,217 --> 00:51:15,389
You get near my client again without my
permission, I'll sue you and the FBI...

759
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:20,017
...for civil rights violations,
file a complaint with the state bar...

760
00:51:20,226 --> 00:51:22,563
...and haul your ass into court!

761
00:51:24,105 --> 00:51:27,568
You're playing big league hardball.
We don't respond to threats.

762
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:32,072
Does Mrs. Sway know you were
hospitalized for drug and alcohol abuse?

763
00:51:40,581 --> 00:51:44,085
It was a treatment center.
Close the door when you leave.

764
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,175
You've been a lawyer for 2 years.
You're not equipped to handle this case.

765
00:51:50,425 --> 00:51:52,927
We know more about
Mark's actions than you do.

766
00:51:53,136 --> 00:51:54,679
You're an amateur.

767
00:51:55,137 --> 00:51:56,514
He's in serious peril.

768
00:51:56,764 --> 00:51:57,974
Think that over.

769
00:52:00,268 --> 00:52:02,061
Let me talk to him.

770
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,275
You are so good.

771
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:12,197
But I won't let you use Mark
to climb into the Governor's chair.

772
00:52:12,447 --> 00:52:14,491
You think you look good on TV?

773
00:52:14,783 --> 00:52:17,786
If you attempt to contact my client
or his family again...

774
00:52:18,036 --> 00:52:20,331
...I'll put Mark on prime-time news.

775
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,168
He can tell everyone how you trampled
a kid's constitutional rights.

776
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:27,505
And I got the tape to prove it.

777
00:52:28,881 --> 00:52:30,757
We'll talk to that boy.

778
00:52:32,176 --> 00:52:36,180
You miss one step, I'll eat you alive.

779
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,608
Jesus Christ.

780
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:49,652
I'll kill that kid.

781
00:52:50,569 --> 00:52:53,739
You lied! You got till 3
to start telling the truth. 1-2-3.

782
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:56,826
You're the liar!
Keep the dollar, you're fired!

783
00:52:57,077 --> 00:52:59,496
You come back here!
Come back here.

784
00:53:00,247 --> 00:53:03,875
-Shit, where did I put my car keys?
-In your purse.

785
00:53:13,426 --> 00:53:15,179
Mark, get in the car.

786
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:17,473
Please.

787
00:53:26,858 --> 00:53:29,318
How did you like the story
this morning?

788
00:53:40,121 --> 00:53:43,207
-He didn't hire a lawyer for his health.
-He knows where the body is.

789
00:53:43,457 --> 00:53:46,879
Even the Mob knows he knows.
That's why they flew in Gronke.

790
00:53:47,129 --> 00:53:48,380
You got it, Wally?

791
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:51,800
We have to get our hands on Mark
before the Mob does.

792
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:55,304
We can petition the court,
alleging the boy needs supervision.

793
00:53:55,554 --> 00:53:58,223
And protection.
Gronke's not here to visit Graceland.

794
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:02,227
We tell the judge it's in the kid's
best interest to take him into custody.

795
00:54:02,478 --> 00:54:05,397
-Get the judge to make him talk.
-Saying he's breaking the law.

796
00:54:05,731 --> 00:54:07,650
He is. He's obstructing justice.

797
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,696
File those petitions.
Incarcerate his young ass tonight.

798
00:54:28,755 --> 00:54:31,340
You said we were
getting rid of the reporters.

799
00:54:31,592 --> 00:54:34,260
Do you see any?
This is my mama's house.

800
00:54:34,428 --> 00:54:35,679
You live with your mother?

801
00:54:35,929 --> 00:54:37,597
This is Momma Love.

802
00:54:37,848 --> 00:54:39,933
Hi, there. You must be Mark.

803
00:54:40,183 --> 00:54:41,893
Take me back to the hospital!

804
00:54:42,311 --> 00:54:45,105
You and I are going to do
some talking first.

805
00:54:45,313 --> 00:54:46,941
Talk, my ass! You're fired!

806
00:54:47,191 --> 00:54:48,275
Fine.

807
00:54:49,443 --> 00:54:50,568
You're the boss.

808
00:54:52,946 --> 00:54:56,617
This is kidnapping or something!
Take me back, right now!

809
00:54:56,867 --> 00:54:58,869
I'll hitchhike if I have to!

810
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,663
Go ahead!

811
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:06,503
Nice meeting you, Mark.

812
00:55:12,717 --> 00:55:14,928
- Who is it?
- Your mother.

813
00:55:15,971 --> 00:55:17,179
Hey, Bono.

814
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:19,933
How you doing, Paulie?

815
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,228
I guess Johnny means business,
bringing you here.

816
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,690
-Where's the kid?
-With that bitch lawyer.

817
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,026
Got a private dick tailing him.

818
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,902
Any sign of the Fibbies?

819
00:55:31,152 --> 00:55:33,989
A couple, watching the hospital,
same as we are.

820
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:36,659
I gave that kid a warning last night.

821
00:55:36,909 --> 00:55:38,619
This is the directive.

822
00:55:39,078 --> 00:55:43,332
We bug everything : hospital room,
lawyer's office, the works.

823
00:55:43,749 --> 00:55:45,877
Find out what the kid knows.

824
00:55:46,252 --> 00:55:47,628
That doesn't work...

825
00:55:48,087 --> 00:55:49,381
...we kill them all.

826
00:55:51,591 --> 00:55:52,842
How's he doing?

827
00:55:53,092 --> 00:55:54,593
He'll come in when he's hungry.

828
00:55:54,844 --> 00:55:57,597
It's lucky a car
only comes by here every 4 hours.

829
00:55:57,847 --> 00:55:59,850
That is one willful child.

830
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,352
Pain in the butt, if you ask me.

831
00:56:03,018 --> 00:56:06,147
Isn't that the pot
calling the kettle black?

832
00:56:18,202 --> 00:56:19,412
Hey, man.

833
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:20,663
How are you?

834
00:56:20,954 --> 00:56:23,540
You're the kid at the hospital, right?

835
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,001
Hop in.

836
00:56:26,209 --> 00:56:27,419
Come on.

837
00:56:27,794 --> 00:56:29,129
What are you doing out here?

838
00:56:29,422 --> 00:56:30,923
Come on, hop in.

839
00:56:31,966 --> 00:56:34,093
My boy's getting much better.

840
00:56:34,886 --> 00:56:36,428
How's your brother doing?

841
00:56:37,888 --> 00:56:39,140
Come on back here.

842
00:56:39,432 --> 00:56:41,059
Elvis has left the building.

843
00:56:41,309 --> 00:56:42,685
I told you so.

844
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:50,235
Take me back to the hospital.

845
00:56:50,651 --> 00:56:51,819
Lemonade?

846
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:54,448
I'm not taking you
anywhere till we talk.

847
00:56:54,698 --> 00:56:55,532
Pie?

848
00:56:55,782 --> 00:56:58,118
Where's the phone?
I must call a cab.

849
00:56:58,409 --> 00:57:00,954
Help yourself.
It's $40 from here, Momma?

850
00:57:01,204 --> 00:57:03,748
Or $45? I'm not sure with a tip.

851
00:57:04,332 --> 00:57:07,669
You're fired! Can't you get that
through your thick head?

852
00:57:07,919 --> 00:57:11,423
Fine. Because I cannot do my job
if you hide things from me.

853
00:57:11,673 --> 00:57:15,927
Did it occur to you how it made me feel
to take on Foltrigg on your behalf...

854
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:17,596
...without the facts?

855
00:57:17,846 --> 00:57:22,017
If I'd smelled your breath first,
I'd have known you was a drunk.

856
00:57:22,351 --> 00:57:23,603
I'll be going.

857
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:26,605
I have been sober for 3 years.

858
00:57:26,856 --> 00:57:30,777
That's what all the drunks say.
How they will get sober.

859
00:57:31,027 --> 00:57:33,279
They say they love you,
but they don't!

860
00:57:33,613 --> 00:57:36,699
Then they come home wasted
and beat you and your mother so bad...

861
00:57:36,949 --> 00:57:39,327
...you gotta hit them
in the face with a bat.

862
00:57:39,953 --> 00:57:42,038
You're talking about your daddy.

863
00:57:42,288 --> 00:57:44,332
I got rid of him.

864
00:57:44,791 --> 00:57:49,212
Me and my mom went to court to buy
a divorce, our lawyer sucked, as usual.

865
00:57:49,505 --> 00:57:53,466
So I went up there
and told the judge about the beatings...

866
00:57:54,134 --> 00:57:56,511
...how he made us sleep in the street.

867
00:57:57,304 --> 00:57:59,974
That's when my father
became my ex-father.

868
00:58:00,224 --> 00:58:01,225
Now I got you...

869
00:58:01,516 --> 00:58:04,186
...and you're a drunk
and a bad lawyer too.

870
00:58:04,395 --> 00:58:06,730
So I'm getting rid of you,
you're fired.

871
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:09,192
I can handle this myself.

872
00:58:13,529 --> 00:58:16,866
I used to think I could handle
everything by myself.

873
00:58:17,158 --> 00:58:20,161
But sometimes being strong
means asking for help.

874
00:58:20,411 --> 00:58:23,081
I know you've taken good care
of your family.

875
00:58:23,331 --> 00:58:25,833
But the FBI won't leave you alone.

876
00:58:27,418 --> 00:58:28,586
Let me help you.

877
00:58:28,836 --> 00:58:29,962
Let go!

878
00:58:30,546 --> 00:58:31,924
I need a cigarette!

879
00:58:32,174 --> 00:58:34,217
Smoking is terrible for you.

880
00:58:36,344 --> 00:58:38,096
What did Romey tell you?

881
00:58:38,346 --> 00:58:42,141
Why do I always answer questions?
Why don't you ever have to?

882
00:58:43,769 --> 00:58:46,022
Fair enough.
Go ahead, ask me something.

883
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,398
Like what?

884
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:51,193
Whatever you want.
There's no rules, no limits.

885
00:58:51,443 --> 00:58:53,278
You ask me and I'll answer.

886
00:58:54,029 --> 00:58:55,364
And you'll tell the truth?

887
00:58:55,614 --> 00:58:57,742
If it takes my skin off.

888
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,540
What's that thing you always wear
around your neck?

889
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,334
This is my mama's compass.

890
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,337
I wear it so I'll never
lose my way again.

891
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,841
Anything else?

892
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,010
These your kids?

893
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,097
They chained down in the basement?

894
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:21,140
They're with their daddy.

895
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,352
-There was a divorce.
-You ever see them?

896
00:59:24,812 --> 00:59:26,313
They don't want to see me.

897
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,523
Because you was drunk
and on drugs?

898
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:32,193
Because after the divorce
I drank some, yes.

899
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,198
I drank a lot.

900
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:40,286
Why?

901
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:46,917
You're right, there must be
a cigarette around here someplace.

902
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:52,173
I married a doctor, worked my ass off
to put him through medical school...

903
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:56,594
...and when he became rich and famous,
he traded me in for a younger model.

904
01:00:03,518 --> 01:00:06,187
I didn't have a dollar to buy food...

905
01:00:06,438 --> 01:00:08,857
...or a car to go look for a job.

906
01:00:09,107 --> 01:00:12,068
But I figured I could
handle it myself, just like you.

907
01:00:12,361 --> 01:00:13,403
But...

908
01:00:14,446 --> 01:00:15,863
...I was wrong.

909
01:00:16,115 --> 01:00:18,409
So then you started to drink?

910
01:00:19,869 --> 01:00:23,455
First...I stopped sleeping and eating.

911
01:00:23,872 --> 01:00:26,625
I kept staying up every night,
watching my babies...

912
01:00:26,834 --> 01:00:29,628
...trying to figure out what to do.

913
01:00:29,836 --> 01:00:32,005
Finally, I took some pills to sleep.

914
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:37,344
Hell, he prescribed them for me.
I was not trying to kill myself.

915
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:40,639
But that's when he pounced.

916
01:00:41,307 --> 01:00:43,601
Got himself a fancy lawyer.

917
01:00:43,809 --> 01:00:45,394
I didn't have anybody.

918
01:00:45,687 --> 01:00:49,315
But I figured after all those years
of blowing noses and wiping butts...

919
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:53,654
...fixing meals and carpooling kids,
that it would count for something.

920
01:00:54,821 --> 01:00:56,281
I was a fool.

921
01:00:58,825 --> 01:01:00,910
The court declared me unfit.

922
01:01:02,413 --> 01:01:03,664
Just like that...

923
01:01:03,914 --> 01:01:05,206
...they were gone.

924
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,043
He took...

925
01:01:08,919 --> 01:01:10,879
...my little girl and boy.

926
01:01:11,254 --> 01:01:13,924
Anyhow, that's when I started drinking.

927
01:01:14,842 --> 01:01:16,886
But I got myself sober.

928
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:18,762
I stayed sober.

929
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:21,807
And put myself through law school.

930
01:01:24,101 --> 01:01:25,728
Do you miss your kids?

931
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:31,692
So much I try
not to even think about them.
