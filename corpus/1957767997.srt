1
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:50,050
There's an isolation
to the woods, isn't there?

2
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:55,055
A sense of unease
in a dark wilderness.

3
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:58,266
Because things disappear there.

4
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,102
Things die there.

5
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:05,065
But she wasn't afraid.
Not at first.

6
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,483
Even though she was alone,

7
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,819
she knew
she could survive the night.

8
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:15,367
But as she got deeper into
the forest, she smelled it.

9
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,996
The rot. The smell of death.

10
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,416
She finally
found them in the clearing.

11
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,418
By now, the long, hot summer

12
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,213
had caused the bodies
to putrefy.

13
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,632
The flies and maggots
were crawl...

14
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:31,925
No fucking way.

15
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:39,928
Oh!

16
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,711
I can't make you straight.

17
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,133
I don't wanna make you straight.

18
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:46,054
Gay people are A-OK with me.

19
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:52,686
If you're happy the way you are,
then more power to you.

20
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,439
And I know what you're thinking.

21
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,108
You hear the words
"gay conversion camp,"

22
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,985
and you start to imagine all
kinds of homophobic bullshit.

23
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:05,198
Well, that is not
what we're about here.

24
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,033
And let me tell you
another thing.

25
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:12,122
God...
God doesn't hate you either.

26
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,666
And any son of a bitch
that tells you otherwise

27
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,750
is a bigoted asshole.

28
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,420
And that is officially
the last time

29
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,922
that you're gonna hear
about the man upstairs.

30
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,882
I promise you.

31
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,722
But I'm guessing
that some of you are here

32
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,017
because in some way
you're not happy.

33
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,102
Maybe you don't fit in.

34
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,770
People make fun of you.

35
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,815
Maybe you wanna find
some new kind of peace,

36
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,151
a new way of thinking
about yourself.

37
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:47,282
Well, you give us this week,
and we might be able to help.

38
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,243
And if not, just enjoy
the sunshine,

39
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,912
and work on your tan.

40
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:57,000
OK. Let me introduce you
to my colleagues.

41
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,170
They do all the real work.
I just cash the checks.

42
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:04,174
This is Dr. Cora Whistler.
She is our licensed therapist,

43
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:07,719
and as you might have guessed
from the name, my wife.

44
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,512
She who must be obeyed.

45
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,930
Next to her is Nurse Molly

46
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,099
who takes care of any
little mishaps that may occur.

47
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,770
Molly's new here,
so take it easy on her.

48
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,439
And that's Zane,
our athletics director

49
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,149
and a former student here.

50
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,901
So, he knows all the ropes.

51
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,112
And, boys, he's taken,
so hands off.

52
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,283
And that beautiful woman
right there

53
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,910
is Sarah, Zane's fiancé.

54
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,454
She's our activities director,

55
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,123
and she is going
to keep you busy.

56
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,583
Believe you me.

57
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,128
And over here we have Balthazar.

58
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,506
That's our handyman,
all-around Mr. Fix it.

59
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,841
Say hello, Balthazar!

60
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:54,808
And that, finally, is old Duke.

61
00:07:54,849 --> 00:08:01,648
Duke is one old hound dog.
So please treat him kindly.

62
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,527
OK. I'm gonna need you
to hand over

63
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,071
all your cell phones
and computers.

64
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,159
As well as any medicines,
narcotics, or cigarettes

65
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,244
that you may have.

66
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,079
Cell phones don't work
out here anyway,

67
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,039
and I'm glad to say
that we don't have any Wi-Fi.

68
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:22,669
So we are off the grid which
will be a nice change, I'm sure.

69
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,547
Molly, if you would. Thank you.

70
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,760
OK. Let me tell you
how the next week is gonna work.

71
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:34,514
We have a number of planned
activities and therapy sessions

72
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,641
that we would like you
to be part of.

73
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,561
But other than that,
you're on your own.

74
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,772
We do have
one hard-and-fast rule here.

75
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,733
And it's about respect.

76
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,359
We deal
with some sensitive issues,

77
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:50,488
and we expect you to treat
your fellow students with care.

78
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,574
And allow them their dignity.

79
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,202
This is a safe space.

80
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,746
For everyone.

81
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,666
And this is
the most important thing

82
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,918
that I want to say to you.

83
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,590
I know that many of you are here

84
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,968
only because your parents
made you.

85
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,889
And while their intentions
may be honorable,

86
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,933
only you can know
what's best for you.

87
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,602
Because the idea of this place

88
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:24,564
is not to come out
more straight or less gay.

89
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,858
Of course we hope
that through your time here

90
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,027
you will discover
a gender normative lifestyle

91
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,279
that is authentic for you but...

92
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:36,618
you must find your own truth.

93
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,954
Let us help you do that.

94
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,040
Please.

95
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,673
OK. So, uh, why don't you
head to your cabins?

96
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,257
Settle in. Unpack.

97
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,969
We'll meet in the lodge in say,
uh, a half hour and get started.

98
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,139
Boys' cabin over there.
Girls' cabin over there.

99
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,409
Yes.

100
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,288
-So this is a thing.
-OK.

101
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,793
I'm trans and nonbinary.
I use they/them pronouns.

102
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:31,006
As in, they can't believe
they're at this fucking camp.

103
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,676
I'm assuming you don't have
an all-gender cabin.

104
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:38,263
No. Not currently.
Obviously we need one.

105
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,682
Maybe so.

106
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:47,105
This place
is all about inclusion.

107
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,567
About being with other kids

108
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,861
and finding
a sense of community.

109
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:57,032
So it's important
that nobody be isolated.

110
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:01,703
I acknowledge
and respect your transition.

111
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,289
So head over to the boys' cabin,

112
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,500
and if you don't feel
comfortable there,

113
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,045
we can talk about other options.

114
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,380
How's that?

115
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,592
Sounds great.

116
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,845
Great. Thanks.

117
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:22,307
And thanks for understanding.

118
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:41,034
- They?
-Yes, ma'am.

119
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:54,422
I want to start with a simple
question. Why are you here?

120
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,138
Toby?

121
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,893
I'm here because

122
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:11,773
I don't want to be
a big flaming fruit anymore.

123
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:16,569
I wanna play hockey
and drink non-light beer

124
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,863
like all the normal guys.

125
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,451
I made a deal with my parents.
If I spent the week here,

126
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,704
I could go to New York
and see Moulin Rouge!.

127
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,331
You look more like
a Sondheim man.

128
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,083
-Queen!
-Well, you're looking at a guy

129
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,711
that saw the original production
of Merrilytwice.

130
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,839
-Bitch!

131
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,384
Veronica. What about you?
Why are you here?

132
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,969
Um...

133
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,097
-No.
Please.

134
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,891
There's no judgments in
this room, OK? Why are you here?

135
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,437
Cause I'm bisexual.
So, I'm a freak and I hate it.

136
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,982
All right? Are you happy?

137
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,112
I'm a swimmer.

138
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:03,575
I know I can get a scholarship,
but not like this.

139
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,245
Not like I am.

140
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,289
I mean, in the locker room
I don't know where to look.

141
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,624
I get so tense
I have to, like, throw up.

142
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,002
No one knows in school.

143
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,505
I'd die if they found out.

144
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:25,722
It's like I'm pretending
to be this thing and...

145
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,932
I don't wanna pretend anymore.

146
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,934
My parents made me come.

147
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,353
I just wanna fit in.

148
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,438
It was come here or you're out
on the street, honey.

149
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,066
When I go to college, I'm gonna
pledge my dad's fraternity,

150
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:39,110
which I kind of have to,
or he's gonna, like, disown me.

151
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,653
I mean, house seats.

152
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,864
I'm not that complicated,
honestly.

153
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,075
I just wanna be
like everybody else.

154
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,201
Fifth row, center.

155
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,037
I wanna give my parents
grandkids.

156
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,123
Like my sister did.

157
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm only here to shut
my parents up

158
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,585
and get some fucking peace.

159
00:13:55,627 --> 00:14:00,882
I have zero interest in not
being gay. I love me some lady.

160
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:04,135
I hear it all the time. "Fag."

161
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,889
"There goes the fag."
"Blow me, fag."

162
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,351
And the laughter.

163
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,520
I don't wanna waste my soul
fighting this thing.

164
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,188
I just wanna make it go away.

165
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,941
Sometimes I wish
I was invisible.

166
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,609
I wanna be entertained.

167
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:22,028
I wanna live my life.

168
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,364
I wanna fit in.

169
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,241
I wanna be loved.

170
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,927
Jordan, you're awfully quiet.

171
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,433
Uh, I don't have
anything to add.

172
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,893
Is he gonna get away with that?

173
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,520
-They.
-Whatever the fuck.

174
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,355
We all talked.

175
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,400
Jordan, this is
a circle of trust.

176
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:03,695
We all shared.
Why are you here?

177
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,953
I come from a religious family.

178
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,623
They don't understand me.

179
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:19,627
We made a deal.
If I come here for a week...

180
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,465
they'll let me legally
emancipate myself.

181
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,011
Emancipate yourself to do what?

182
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,681
Be myself.

183
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,939
All right. I wanna thank you all

184
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:43,401
for your trust
and for your honesty.

185
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:47,322
I've been through therapy, so I
know how difficult this can be.

186
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:53,453
Being at peace with yourself,
with your true self,

187
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,164
that's the hardest thing to do,
isn't it?

188
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:01,044
OK. That's it for today.

189
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,962
So, dinner is in an hour,

190
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:06,132
and we'll start up again
in the morning.

191
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,009
Enjoy the night.

192
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,782
Wrong team, fuckwad.

193
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,702
Gentlemen,
you have a new roommate.

194
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:23,163
All I ask from you people
is honesty.

195
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,457
Honesty
in how you treat each other.

196
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,625
And honesty in
how you present yourselves.

197
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,502
Lying is not going
to get us anywhere.

198
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,504
I wasn't lying.
This is who I am.

199
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:33,465
Jordan treated me with respect

200
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,092
by being truthful
about their transition.

201
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:39,262
You did not. Simple as that.

202
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,389
OK, everyone out front.
Ten minutes for roll call.

203
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:45,560
And, please,
dress appropriately.

204
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,358
The fuck is this?

205
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,026
What does it fucking look like,
boyfriend?

206
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:55,487
Freak show
is what it looks like.

207
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,739
How am I supposed
to dress appropriately?

208
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,700
I'm a woman. I don't have
any goddamn boy clothes.

209
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,369
Hey. Hey.

210
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,831
Don't worry about it. OK?
We'll get you some clothes.

211
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:11,586
-Can anybody spare some clothes?
-Not my vintage stuff, but sure.

212
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:41,032
I'm not sure
that entirely suits you, Jordan.

213
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,451
Not my color?

214
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:48,748
OK. I'd like you all
to say hello to Alexander,

215
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,293
who is obviously dealing
with some complicated issues.

216
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:55,839
We welcome him gladly
and with love.

217
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,551
OK, let's have some fun.

218
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,352
-Go!
-Pull!

219
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,604
Pull it. Pull it. Come on.

220
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,081
Can I help you?

221
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,546
I need my pills.
The ones you took.

222
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:03,842
-I'm sorry, I can't.
-No, honey, I need them.

223
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,803
Sit down. Please.

224
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,980
I don't make the rules here.
If you wanna talk to Owen...

225
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:18,773
I need them.

226
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:27,615
It's the, uh, the Zoloft.

227
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,163
This is a pretty powerful
antidepressant.

228
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:35,707
I don't think I can give it
to you without checking with...

229
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:37,917
Without checking
with one of those fuckers

230
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,336
who runs the place?

231
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:40,962
Come on.

232
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:46,134
As misguided as they may be
about some things,

233
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,635
I can't just ignore protocol.

234
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:50,138
It's not Zoloft, all right?

235
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,647
-Estradiol.
-It's an estrogen hormone.

236
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,361
-I made a deal with my parents.
-I know.

237
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:06,363
You come here,
or they throw you out.

238
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:09,074
It's... It's not that.

239
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,658
At all.

240
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,709
When I turned 18,

241
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:23,004
I thought there was nothing
they could do to stop me.

242
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,882
But I was wrong.

243
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:31,888
I have a younger brother,
and he means the world to me.

244
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,224
And I mean the world to him.

245
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,976
And they said that if I did not
come to this place,

246
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:40,522
that they would never let me
see him again.

247
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:48,238
Anyway, I need my pills.

248
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,539
Our secret.

249
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:14,139
This camp, do you even believe
in any of this?

250
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:18,143
I believe in healing.
That's all.

251
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,646
Maybe you should believe
in dignity.

252
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:55,889
??

253
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,602
Up and at 'em, gents!

254
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,772
Get dressed!

255
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:06,900
It's time to play.

256
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:34,928
OK, let's hold up here.

257
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:40,183
Everyone, please remove your
blindfolds and gather round.

258
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:42,227
Come on. Step up.

259
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:46,064
Let me tell you something
that I've learned.

260
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:48,942
Self-reliance is a cornerstone

261
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:52,195
of self-confidence
and self-love.

262
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:56,199
But trust in your community
is vital.

263
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:57,742
You're not alone.

264
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:02,997
There is always help if you
are brave enough to ask for it.

265
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:08,336
Look at your partners.
Go on. Look.

266
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:13,675
Trust them. Accept them.

267
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:16,219
Love them.

268
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:20,223
OK. Each pair head off
in a different direction,

269
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:24,561
walk around for ten minutes
and stop.

270
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:27,355
And we will see you
in the morning.

271
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:29,315
What?

272
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:33,695
Do you have a problem with that?

273
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,532
No, sir.

274
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:39,826
I'm sure the Geneva Convention
has some protocol about this.

275
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:43,038
Well, the next time I'm in
Switzerland, I'll ask them.

276
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,374
Now, start walking.

277
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:50,337
Go on. Move.

278
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:52,797
Go!

279
00:27:56,718 --> 00:28:00,055
-This should be cozy.
-Fuck me.

280
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:32,045
I don't know
that I'm ready for all this.

281
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:35,882
Yeah, you don't really give off
camper vibes.

282
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:39,928
No. I mean...

283
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:45,308
Well, Alexander...
Alexandra, whatever,

284
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,311
I don't really know
any trans people.

285
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:49,688
He really surprised me.

286
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:55,360
-It's "she", actually.
-I can't even get that right.

287
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:58,571
I just don't think
like you guys do.

288
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:00,573
I live
in this super-straight suburb.

289
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:02,075
Everyone's the same.

290
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:06,788
Except me.

291
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:14,379
-I know what you mean.
-Do you?

292
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:20,176
Look at you.
You're so chill.

293
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:25,140
Try that haircut in my school.
No one would talk to you.

294
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:30,979
-I'd talk to me.
-I'd be scared to talk to you.

295
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,190
You're not scared now.

296
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:37,360
Just a little.

297
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:03,261
Alexandra.

298
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:09,434
This doesn't feel right.
This whole place.

299
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:12,937
It's a gay conversion camp.
Nothing about it's right.

300
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:15,106
I know, but I would
understand it a whole lot more

301
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:18,485
if there was a lot more Bible-
thumping and queer-bashing.

302
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,529
But there's not.

303
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:25,575
-That's what scares me.

304
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,092
Who is that?

305
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:57,625
"A woman shall not wear
a man's garment,

306
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:01,629
nor shall a man go out
in a woman's cloak,

307
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:06,718
for whoever does these things
is an abomination

308
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,137
to the Lord your God."

309
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:27,155
Too late. I'm pregnant.

310
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,751
You OK?

311
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:27,716
Come in, please.

312
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:44,399
It can't have been easy
choosing to live this way.

313
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:51,197
-It wasn't a choice.
-I understand.

314
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:56,828
Believe me, I've been there.
I was a navy brat.

315
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:02,584
I moved every few years.
Base to base.

316
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,796
It was all navy, all the time.

317
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:10,175
All my brothers
went into the navy.

318
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:12,469
I was the only one who didn't.

319
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:16,097
I was just so...

320
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:20,101
different.

321
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:26,483
After a while,
I stopped trying to fit in.

322
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:33,114
I was never gonna get my
parents' love like my brothers.

323
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:39,621
I suppose if I'd been
of your generation...

324
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:44,459
I might have chosen
to become a boy too.

325
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:51,299
So they wouldn't be
so disappointed in me.

326
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:56,763
Do you think your parents
are disappointed in you?

327
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:02,852
Sometimes.

328
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:08,650
That must make you sad.
Or angry.

329
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:17,450
-Both.
Sure. I know.

330
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:22,247
'Cause no matter what you do,
you'll never be good enough.

331
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,292
Or straight enough.

332
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:29,629
Or man enough.

333
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:33,508
Or woman enough.
It's like you're nothing...

334
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:37,303
to them.

335
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:40,807
You're not even a freak.
You're nothing.

336
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:51,484
So what do you do?

337
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:55,905
You try
to make yourself special.

338
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:59,200
So they'll see you.

339
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:01,828
So they'll notice you.

340
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,747
So they'll love you.

341
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:08,918
You become...

342
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:13,882
they.

343
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:27,187
Honey, that's not gonna work.

344
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:30,482
This thing you invented,
it's a fake.

345
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:37,030
They're never gonna love you.
No one is.

346
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:41,993
Not unless you drop this
nonsense and admit what you are.

347
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:51,795
A scared, lonely,
ugly little dyke.

348
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,269
Our time's up for today, Jordan.

349
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:11,272
Have a good night.

350
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:36,923
This one yesterday.
And this one.

351
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,591
Look how cute he is. Yeah.

352
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:41,261
-This one.
It's so sweet.

353
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:43,304
It is, right?

354
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:56,484
You OK?

355
00:37:57,652 --> 00:37:59,320
Hm-hmm.

356
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:03,867
Lady Macbitch
give you a hard time?

357
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:04,909
Hm-hmm.

358
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:12,792
You sure you're all right?

359
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:20,050
Do you ever wonder...

360
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,762
you know...

361
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:29,517
how we are?

362
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:33,688
How we present ourselves?

363
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,817
How true that all is?

364
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:42,364
All these masks?

365
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:46,826
We need the masks
to protect ourselves.

366
00:38:46,868 --> 00:38:49,621
But, I mean, are we...
are we choosing all this?

367
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:51,831
Do you think we are?

368
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:54,376
No.

369
00:38:57,962 --> 00:38:59,881
Sometimes.

370
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:04,135
All my life...

371
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:10,433
...I've been different.

372
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:16,564
Not this, not that.
Just this other thing.

373
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:18,858
Me.

374
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:21,903
You're still you.

375
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:29,744
I've been fighting to be me
for so long.

376
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,416
I'm tired of fighting.

377
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:38,420
I just wanna be.

378
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,382
Listen...

379
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:45,635
I understand, but...

380
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:48,847
what choice do we have?

381
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:50,932
This is us.

382
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,399
I wish you could be kinder
to yourself, Jordan.

383
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:02,944
You're so mean
when you talk about yourself.

384
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:09,284
Change the voices in your head.

385
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:11,911
Make them like you instead.

386
00:40:12,954 --> 00:40:18,752
* So complicated,
look how we all make it

387
00:40:18,793 --> 00:40:24,758
* Filled with so much hatred,
such a tired game

388
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:29,179
* It's enough,
I've done all I can think of

389
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:34,351
* Chased down all my demons,
I've seen you do the same

390
00:40:34,392 --> 00:40:37,854
* Oh, pretty, pretty please

391
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:40,190
* Don't you ever, ever feel

392
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:46,112
* Like you're less
than fuckin' perfect

393
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:50,700
* Pretty, pretty please,
if you ever, ever feel

394
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:56,664
* Like you're nothing,
you're fuckin' perfect to me

395
00:40:56,706 --> 00:40:58,750
* The whole world's scared
so I swallow my fear

396
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:01,670
* The only thing I should be
drinking is an ice-cold beer

397
00:41:01,711 --> 00:41:04,005
* So cool in line
and we try, try, try

398
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:06,758
* But we try too hard
and it's a waste of my time

399
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,302
* Done looking for the critics
'cause they're everywhere

400
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:11,888
* They don't like my jeans,
they don't get my hair

401
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:15,016
* Exchange ourselves,
and we do it all the time

402
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:16,601
Why do we do that?

403
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:17,977
Why do I do that?

404
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:19,646
Why do I do that?

405
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:27,696
* Oh...

406
00:41:27,737 --> 00:41:30,740
* Oh, baby, baby, baby

407
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:34,911
* Pretty, pretty please,
don't you ever, ever feel

408
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:41,001
* Like you're less
than fuckin' perfect

409
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:45,505
* Pretty, pretty please,
if you ever, ever feel

410
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:47,799
* Like you're nothing

411
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:53,888
* You're fuckin' perfect to me

412
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,349
* Yeah

413
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:59,019
* You're perfect

414
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,855
* You're perfect

415
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:06,568
* Pretty, pretty please,
if you ever, ever feel

416
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:08,778
* Like you're nothing

417
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:14,242
- To me

418
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:49,791
Jordan.

419
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:55,046
-What are you doing here?
-Did you know?

420
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:07,267
Look how long
they've been doing this.

421
00:46:07,308 --> 00:46:08,351
Oh, my God.

422
00:46:11,646 --> 00:46:13,773
No, I didn't know.

423
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:15,817
Not really.

424
00:46:16,901 --> 00:46:18,820
Maybe I didn't want to.

425
00:46:19,821 --> 00:46:22,824
Alexandra said
you helped her with her pills.

426
00:46:24,034 --> 00:46:27,871
-Now you have to help all of us.
-Do what?

427
00:46:27,912 --> 00:46:30,749
-Protect us.
-From what?

428
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:32,876
From this!

429
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:38,173
I'll do what I can.

430
00:46:41,676 --> 00:46:43,553
But, Jordan...

431
00:46:44,846 --> 00:46:46,348
Be careful.

432
00:46:46,389 --> 00:46:51,186
This could get a lot worse,
and... he doesn't like you.

433
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:57,192
Well, he has no idea
who he's hunting this time.

434
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:26,406
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

435
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:28,575
Today we're gonna shake it up
a little bit.

436
00:48:28,616 --> 00:48:32,078
Boys, you come with me and Zane.
Girls, you go with Sarah.

437
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,164
Enjoy this beautiful morning.

438
00:48:34,205 --> 00:48:37,375
It's a great day to be alive,
isn't it?

439
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:40,920
Come on, Duke.
Come on. Let's go, boy.

440
00:48:40,962 --> 00:48:42,589
-Let's get out of here.
-See ya.

441
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,632
Come on, ladies. This way.

442
00:48:49,262 --> 00:48:51,473
-He's sick.
-What?

443
00:48:51,514 --> 00:48:54,476
When our dog got sick,
he walked like that.

444
00:48:54,517 --> 00:48:58,480
So sad.
I hate to see animals in pain.

445
00:48:59,564 --> 00:49:02,984
I have a new dog now.
He's a dachshund.

446
00:49:03,026 --> 00:49:07,489
-Miniature, of course.
-Of course.

447
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:09,449
Now, don't laugh.
I know, I know.

448
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:11,201
I look like homemaker Barbie.

449
00:49:11,242 --> 00:49:12,869
Barbie was never that hot.

450
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:16,873
Today we're gonna be exploring
traditional gender roles.

451
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:19,209
By behaving in a certain way,

452
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,877
by learning to recognize

453
00:49:20,919 --> 00:49:23,463
and accept modes
of societal behaviors,

454
00:49:23,505 --> 00:49:26,299
perhaps we'll come to appreciate
the emotional value

455
00:49:26,341 --> 00:49:28,843
in reinforcing these behaviors.

456
00:49:28,885 --> 00:49:33,348
Even finding comfort and a sense
of community within them.

457
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:37,018
So, ladies.

458
00:49:37,852 --> 00:49:39,562
Let's make a pie.

459
00:49:45,151 --> 00:49:46,986
OK. Listen up.

460
00:49:47,028 --> 00:49:49,781
Two things control this world.

461
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:53,410
Biology and history.

462
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:57,247
I know this is not
a popular thing to say nowadays,

463
00:49:57,288 --> 00:49:59,916
but men have naturally evolved

464
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:04,170
to be larger and stronger
than women.

465
00:50:04,212 --> 00:50:05,797
There's a reason for that.

466
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,425
Our forefathers were hunters.

467
00:50:08,466 --> 00:50:12,095
They had to chase down game
and subdue it.

468
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:16,016
They hunted or they starved.

469
00:50:16,057 --> 00:50:18,685
It's in our DNA, gentlemen.

470
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:20,770
We're meant to be killers.

471
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:24,357
This is
our biological imperative.

472
00:50:24,399 --> 00:50:28,903
And no amount of civilization,
no amount of progress,

473
00:50:28,945 --> 00:50:35,618
no amount of liberal humanism
can alter that genetic truth.

474
00:50:36,953 --> 00:50:39,289
You can't argue with science.

475
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:40,623
And science tells us that

476
00:50:40,665 --> 00:50:43,543
we are meant to pass
that necessary DNA

477
00:50:43,585 --> 00:50:47,714
down through the bloodline,
through women,

478
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:51,259
through impregnating women
and having children.

479
00:50:52,635 --> 00:50:56,097
That is science.
And that is history.

480
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,100
So...

481
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:03,271
Who's got the killer instinct?

482
00:51:12,614 --> 00:51:15,784
-Oh, amazing. Good job.
-Thank you.

483
00:51:19,287 --> 00:51:22,749
Oh, that's beautiful, Kim.
Really exceptional work.

484
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:26,086
-Good for you, honey.
-I bake with my mom.

485
00:51:26,127 --> 00:51:29,464
That's great.
You know, I did that too.

486
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:32,801
Oh, you've got a bit of flour
on your chin.

487
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,680
There. That's better.

488
00:51:36,721 --> 00:51:39,599
What is that lipstick?
It is so pretty.

489
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:42,852
-Um, uh, it's, like, coral.
-Oh.

490
00:51:42,894 --> 00:51:44,062
From the mall.

491
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:45,855
Will you let me borrow it
sometime?

492
00:51:45,897 --> 00:51:47,482
Hey.

493
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:49,651
What do we do with all
these pies when they're done?

494
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:52,237
Why, we serve them to the boys,
of course.

495
00:51:52,278 --> 00:51:54,322
Serve them as in wait on them?

496
00:51:56,908 --> 00:52:00,328
Oh, a little domesticity
won't kill you, dear.

497
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:05,977
Molly!

498
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,898
What are you doing here?

499
00:53:09,939 --> 00:53:12,692
I'm sorry.
I was just... just wandering.

500
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:16,613
Well, this place
isn't up to code. It's not safe.

501
00:53:16,654 --> 00:53:18,490
OK. Sorry.

502
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:23,745
You are with the program, right?

503
00:53:26,664 --> 00:53:27,749
Yes, of course.

504
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:33,338
I knew you were family.

505
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,006
Come along then, dear.

506
00:53:56,945 --> 00:54:01,282
Alexandra. Girl vs wild.

507
00:54:11,543 --> 00:54:13,837
-You've done this before.
-Oh, yeah.

508
00:54:13,878 --> 00:54:18,425
Once or twice.
Between drag shows, you know.

509
00:54:18,466 --> 00:54:20,176
How about we make it
more challenging?

510
00:54:20,218 --> 00:54:22,345
How about a little contest,
you and me?

511
00:54:23,054 --> 00:54:26,307
-You bet.
-Hold your fire!

512
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:31,980
Move those two back ten feet.
Give us clean targets.

513
00:54:37,944 --> 00:54:42,073
I'm guessing you're
pretty good with firearms.

514
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:45,452
Oh, yeah. Well, me and my dad
used to hunt a lot.

515
00:54:48,246 --> 00:54:52,625
I wonder what that's like.
Being hunted.

516
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:56,338
Knowing no matter what you do,
you're gonna die.

517
00:54:56,379 --> 00:54:59,674
'Cause your opponent's
bigger, stronger,

518
00:54:59,716 --> 00:55:02,052
and smarter than you are.

519
00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:05,847
Oh, and better looking.

520
00:55:08,391 --> 00:55:11,478
-Best out of four?
-Sure.

521
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:13,480
Well, come on, baby boy.
Show me what you got.

522
00:55:13,521 --> 00:55:17,150
No, no, please. Ladies first.

523
00:55:48,014 --> 00:55:50,058
Girlfriend, you better!

524
00:56:04,447 --> 00:56:07,534
I'll be damned!
It's hit! It's hit!

525
00:56:07,575 --> 00:56:10,745
-Good shot!

526
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:13,873
Come on!

527
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:17,377
Junior marksman
three years running.

528
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:19,754
Or marksperson, I should say.

529
00:56:20,547 --> 00:56:22,882
Well done, Jordan.

530
00:56:22,924 --> 00:56:26,553
You are constantly
surprising me.

531
00:56:26,594 --> 00:56:28,888
Get over it, Zane.
He beat you fair and square.

532
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,181
They.

533
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:34,102
That's right. My mistake.

534
00:56:37,564 --> 00:56:39,816
OK. Gather round.

535
00:56:42,152 --> 00:56:44,904
Now, shooting paper targets
is one thing,

536
00:56:44,946 --> 00:56:48,742
but it's not the biological
imperative, is it?

537
00:56:48,783 --> 00:56:52,912
Shooting flesh,
ripping flesh, eating flesh,

538
00:56:52,954 --> 00:56:57,083
that's our genetic programming,
gentlemen.

539
00:56:57,125 --> 00:57:02,964
So, who is gonna live up
to our great ancestors?

540
00:57:06,301 --> 00:57:08,470
Where's my killer?

541
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,106
I'm not really sure
you did your best.

542
00:57:20,148 --> 00:57:22,859
I'm sure. I didn't.

543
00:57:24,277 --> 00:57:28,615
OK, ladies. Nice work today.

544
00:57:28,656 --> 00:57:30,033
And now, you actually have

545
00:57:30,075 --> 00:57:33,161
a bit of unscheduled free time
before dinner.

546
00:57:33,203 --> 00:57:35,830
Enjoy yourselves.

547
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,669
Kim, can you stay for a minute?

548
00:57:43,672 --> 00:57:45,674
Go ahead, Veronica.

549
00:57:51,721 --> 00:57:54,974
I think we owe ourselves
a taste, don't we?

550
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:58,269
Just one little slice.

551
00:57:58,311 --> 00:58:00,313
We'll share to save on calories.

552
00:58:02,023 --> 00:58:05,193
Oh. It is just so lovely.
I hate to cut it.

553
00:58:13,118 --> 00:58:17,706
You're lovely too.
Just like your pie.

554
00:58:17,747 --> 00:58:22,210
Perfectly formed. Nice and warm.

555
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:25,630
Curvy outside.

556
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,553
Juicy inside, I'll bet.

557
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:37,684
Taste?

558
00:58:38,309 --> 00:58:40,061
Go on.

559
00:58:41,604 --> 00:58:44,941
I'm... not really hungry.

560
00:58:44,983 --> 00:58:46,651
I am.

561
00:58:52,532 --> 00:58:53,867
Mmm.

562
00:58:57,537 --> 00:58:59,706
It's just like I dreamed about.

563
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:07,213
I dream a lot.

564
00:59:12,302 --> 00:59:14,262
What do you dream about, Kim?

565
00:59:20,435 --> 00:59:22,729
Oh, what's the matter, dear?

566
00:59:26,107 --> 00:59:27,609
Where's my killer?

567
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:29,027
Who's a man here?

568
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:32,739
Who's gonna step up
and be worthy of his sex?

569
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:35,617
Who's got some fucking balls?

570
00:59:40,914 --> 00:59:45,001
Toby? Step forward.

571
00:59:45,043 --> 00:59:48,171
-Shit.
-Oh, come on, Mr. Sondheim.

572
00:59:48,213 --> 00:59:52,175
Nothing to be scared of.
You trust me, don't you?

573
00:59:59,557 --> 01:00:02,102
You see old Duke over there?

574
01:00:05,313 --> 01:00:06,773
Shoot him.

575
01:00:10,985 --> 01:00:12,278
Look.

576
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:14,948
He's got cancer.

577
01:00:14,989 --> 01:00:19,703
He's in a lot of pain.
Put him out of his misery.

578
01:00:19,744 --> 01:00:23,123
-No way.
-You're doing him a favor.

579
01:00:23,164 --> 01:00:25,458
Look at him.

580
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,335
He can barely walk anymore.

581
01:00:31,673 --> 01:00:33,174
No.

582
01:00:35,343 --> 01:00:40,807
OK. This is how this is
gonna go down, boyfriend.

583
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:44,019
You're gonna shoot old Duke,

584
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:47,147
or Zane is gonna take
that sledgehammer,

585
01:00:47,188 --> 01:00:49,941
and he's gonna break
one of his legs.

586
01:00:51,651 --> 01:00:53,611
Then he's gonna break
the other leg.

587
01:00:53,653 --> 01:00:55,655
He's gonna torture
that poor old dog,

588
01:00:55,697 --> 01:00:57,157
and you're gonna watch.

589
01:00:57,198 --> 01:00:59,367
And old Duke is gonna bleed out
all over the fucking place

590
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:00,618
and howl like the devil

591
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,162
because he doesn't know
what the fuck's going on

592
01:01:02,203 --> 01:01:05,373
and he can't move because
both of his legs are broken.

593
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:08,793
Are you gonna let that happen?

594
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:11,254
Are you gonna let him
suffer like that?

595
01:01:11,963 --> 01:01:14,215
Raise your riffle! Raise it!

596
01:01:15,633 --> 01:01:19,012
-Don't miss, though.

597
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:20,472
Don't make him suffer.

598
01:01:21,556 --> 01:01:23,058
One shot.

599
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:27,520
Head or heart.
Head or heart. Head or heart.

600
01:01:27,562 --> 01:01:30,065
Pull the trigger,
you fucking queen!

601
01:01:31,483 --> 01:01:33,068
Be a man for the first time
in your fucking life!

602
01:01:33,109 --> 01:01:36,071
-Do it! Be a fucking man!

603
01:02:02,555 --> 01:02:04,432
There's my killer.

604
01:02:52,647 --> 01:02:56,359
Ooh, I'm gonna tell.

605
01:02:56,401 --> 01:03:00,488
You were supposed
to turn in all your narcotics.

606
01:03:08,663 --> 01:03:10,331
That bitch...

607
01:03:11,666 --> 01:03:15,170
had her hands all over me
two seconds after you left.

608
01:03:16,838 --> 01:03:19,924
While she was
complimenting my pie.

609
01:03:19,966 --> 01:03:21,509
Oh, fuck.

610
01:03:24,971 --> 01:03:27,349
-You OK?
-Yeah.

611
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:31,519
Kim, we've gotta do something.

612
01:03:32,854 --> 01:03:36,566
-Like what?
-We have to tell someone.

613
01:03:39,235 --> 01:03:41,363
Like they don't already know.

614
01:03:42,947 --> 01:03:45,450
She's nothing but a fake.

615
01:03:48,286 --> 01:03:50,038
Just like I am.

616
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:02,342
I am trying so hard
to be straight.

617
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:09,015
I want this to work so bad.

618
01:04:16,856 --> 01:04:20,902
-But it isn't.
-Kim... Kim, it's all right.

619
01:04:22,028 --> 01:04:23,363
Look at me.

620
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:27,242
Look at me.

621
01:04:33,289 --> 01:04:37,210
A strong, smart girl like you

622
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:40,839
shouldn't be trying to make
other people happy with some...

623
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,298
pretend life.

624
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:46,928
You're more
than what people want you to be.

625
01:04:48,805 --> 01:04:52,600
So you're gay. Big fucking deal.

626
01:04:58,106 --> 01:05:01,693
Kim, I don't wanna be cured.

627
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:07,115
Thing is,

628
01:05:07,157 --> 01:05:09,993
I'm writing a piece
for my college paper

629
01:05:10,035 --> 01:05:13,121
about how fucked up
gay conversion is.

630
01:05:17,751 --> 01:05:19,961
I'm so sorry I lied to you.

631
01:05:32,265 --> 01:05:35,643
I keep expecting Jason Voorhees
to come out of these woods.

632
01:05:36,811 --> 01:05:38,521
Who?

633
01:07:35,597 --> 01:07:37,640
Toby, you're not listening.

634
01:07:37,682 --> 01:07:38,975
I hear you, but...

635
01:07:39,017 --> 01:07:40,393
What are we supposed to do?
We're fucking trapped.

636
01:07:40,435 --> 01:07:42,395
No! I'm not gonna
sit here another hour.

637
01:07:42,437 --> 01:07:44,522
I'm gonna walk my ass into town
and get the fuck out.

638
01:07:44,564 --> 01:07:46,816
It's a long way
through the forest,

639
01:07:46,858 --> 01:07:47,942
and it's almost night.

640
01:07:47,984 --> 01:07:49,569
She's right, Toby.

641
01:07:49,611 --> 01:07:54,449
We have to get out of here.
This is only gonna get worse.

642
01:07:54,491 --> 01:07:57,994
We're gonna take their bus
tomorrow morning, early,

643
01:07:58,036 --> 01:07:59,954
before everyone else is awake.

644
01:07:59,996 --> 01:08:01,081
What about Stu and Gabriel?

645
01:08:01,122 --> 01:08:02,999
Stu? You wanna bring
frat boy Stu?

646
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:05,251
Honey, he's practically
my fiancé by now.

647
01:08:05,293 --> 01:08:09,714
OK. We'll wake the boys up
just before we go.

648
01:08:09,756 --> 01:08:10,882
Same with the girls.

649
01:08:10,924 --> 01:08:13,593
They wanna come, they can.
Their choice.

650
01:08:13,635 --> 01:08:15,637
But for tonight,
don't do anything

651
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:16,888
that'll get you noticed.

652
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:18,932
Just keep your head down and...

653
01:08:18,973 --> 01:08:23,645
and no matter what happens,
before dawn, we go.

654
01:08:52,382 --> 01:08:55,760
-Is it cold?
No, it's good.

655
01:08:56,886 --> 01:08:58,888
You wanna be alone?

656
01:09:00,932 --> 01:09:02,517
No.

657
01:09:36,217 --> 01:09:40,722
-You look like a girl.
-No, I don't.

658
01:10:19,678 --> 01:10:21,262
Wait.

659
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:23,640
Not here.

660
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:11,039
So...

661
01:12:12,207 --> 01:12:13,333
Fuck.

662
01:12:15,877 --> 01:12:19,673
I know I should feel guilty,
but...

663
01:12:20,215 --> 01:12:21,800
Do you?

664
01:12:22,717 --> 01:12:26,554
Fuck, no.
I'll feel guilty tomorrow.

665
01:12:27,097 --> 01:12:28,890
Maybe.

666
01:12:32,185 --> 01:12:37,399
What about you? Do you feel bad?

667
01:12:39,025 --> 01:12:42,445
-Not at all.
-But...

668
01:12:42,487 --> 01:12:45,115
you don't wanna be gay, do you?

669
01:12:46,741 --> 01:12:49,077
I wanna be exactly what I am.

670
01:12:50,829 --> 01:12:54,749
In this life of ours,
you have to know what you are.

671
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:57,460
There's so many labels now.

672
01:12:57,502 --> 01:13:00,839
Gay, bi, queer, trans.

673
01:13:01,881 --> 01:13:04,592
But there's only two
that really matter.

674
01:13:05,927 --> 01:13:09,014
Predator and prey.

675
01:13:13,935 --> 01:13:15,812
I know what I am.

676
01:13:16,896 --> 01:13:18,606
What are you?

677
01:13:24,112 --> 01:13:26,573
Time to find out.

678
01:13:30,702 --> 01:13:33,038
I'm very disappointed in you,
Stuart.

679
01:13:33,788 --> 01:13:35,665
I had such high hopes.

680
01:13:35,707 --> 01:13:37,459
Thought he was gonna be
the one.

681
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,960
No, I knew.

682
01:13:39,961 --> 01:13:41,671
What is this?

683
01:13:41,713 --> 01:13:44,591
Gabriel
is our little forbidden fruit,

684
01:13:44,632 --> 01:13:46,593
if you'll pardon the expression.

685
01:13:46,634 --> 01:13:49,971
Someone always wants
to take a bite.

686
01:13:51,139 --> 01:13:54,809
-You did this on purpose?
-So did you, honey.

687
01:13:56,144 --> 01:13:58,605
No, you know what? Fuck this.

688
01:14:00,815 --> 01:14:02,275
Seriously?

689
01:14:02,317 --> 01:14:06,821
With some students, a more
advanced therapy is needed.

690
01:14:07,989 --> 01:14:10,784
Zane went through it
and look at him.

691
01:14:10,825 --> 01:14:12,744
Straight as the day is long.

692
01:14:12,786 --> 01:14:14,287
No, he's a fucking sadist
and so are you.

693
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:18,249
Oh, not at all. Come on.
I wanna show you something.

694
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:20,502
Come on, come on.

695
01:14:27,008 --> 01:14:30,136
Do you know
what aversion therapy is?

696
01:14:30,178 --> 01:14:34,474
Have a seat. Come on.
Sit down. It's OK, it's OK.

697
01:14:34,516 --> 01:14:37,644
Relax, relax, relax.

698
01:14:37,686 --> 01:14:42,023
Aversion therapy
is a kind of medical procedure

699
01:14:42,065 --> 01:14:44,609
that teaches people
to not like the things

700
01:14:44,651 --> 01:14:45,985
that they think they like,

701
01:14:46,027 --> 01:14:48,697
things that they know
are bad for them,

702
01:14:48,738 --> 01:14:51,366
like smoking,
or overeating, or...

703
01:14:51,408 --> 01:14:53,034
fucking boys.

704
01:14:54,244 --> 01:14:55,620
Jesus Christ!

705
01:14:55,662 --> 01:14:59,708
-Shh. Quiet, quiet. Easy, easy.

706
01:14:59,749 --> 01:15:01,835
-Let me go!
-Won't do any good, bro.

707
01:15:01,876 --> 01:15:05,505
Trust me. I've been there.

708
01:15:05,547 --> 01:15:07,841
Now, it's true
that this procedure

709
01:15:07,882 --> 01:15:09,968
requires a little discomfort.

710
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:12,053
But, in the end,
you will be the frat boy

711
01:15:12,095 --> 01:15:13,930
that your father
expects you to be,

712
01:15:13,972 --> 01:15:17,642
and you will be the man
that you want to be.

713
01:15:17,684 --> 01:15:21,730
That's what you wanted, right?
To be normal?

714
01:15:23,523 --> 01:15:24,983
Hey, look at the bright side,
Stuart.

715
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:28,695
In my grandfather's day,
you'd be on a lobotomy table.

716
01:15:28,737 --> 01:15:31,197
That's how we used to treat
people with your condition.

717
01:15:31,239 --> 01:15:33,616
I don't have a condition.
I'm just fucking gay.

718
01:15:33,658 --> 01:15:35,827
Well, we'll soon see about that.

719
01:15:42,334 --> 01:15:44,753
Big picture, Stuart.

720
01:15:44,794 --> 01:15:46,755
Look at the big picture.

721
01:15:46,796 --> 01:15:49,966
You have a chance right now...

722
01:15:50,008 --> 01:15:52,635
to change your entire life.

723
01:15:57,057 --> 01:16:01,770
No more feeling like a freak.
No more shame. No more guilt.

724
01:16:01,811 --> 01:16:06,399
Just happiness.
Just being like everybody else.

725
01:16:06,441 --> 01:16:11,154
Isn't that what you wanted?
Isn't that why you're here?

726
01:16:16,326 --> 01:16:21,247
Trust me. It's easy. Stuart.

727
01:16:21,289 --> 01:16:24,793
Stuart. Are you listening to me?

728
01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:29,214
All you have to do
is look at the screen,

729
01:16:29,255 --> 01:16:31,299
and we take care
of everything else.

730
01:16:32,509 --> 01:16:36,513
And please, just remember...

731
01:16:36,554 --> 01:16:39,099
this is for your own good.

732
01:17:21,182 --> 01:17:24,352
You need to look
at the picture, son.

733
01:17:24,394 --> 01:17:27,313
Come on. Come on, Stu. It's OK.

734
01:17:27,355 --> 01:17:32,318
Good boy, good boy. Come on.
Take a look. Take a look.

735
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,547
-What the hell is this?
-We got a situation.

736
01:18:34,589 --> 01:18:35,840
Jesus, what happened to him?

737
01:18:35,882 --> 01:18:37,717
He'll be fine.
He just needs to rest.

738
01:18:37,759 --> 01:18:39,594
Looks like he needs
to be in a hospital.

739
01:18:39,636 --> 01:18:42,055
Take it easy.

740
01:18:42,097 --> 01:18:44,933
Jesus. This is bullshit!
This whole place is crazy!

741
01:18:44,974 --> 01:18:48,311
Close your mouth, woman!
You are an employee here!

742
01:18:48,353 --> 01:18:51,398
And you will do what I tell you,
or you will get the fuck out!

743
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:52,691
Don't you dare threaten me.

744
01:18:52,732 --> 01:18:54,567
And you don't need to fire me.
I quit.

745
01:18:54,609 --> 01:18:56,069
I am taking this boy
to the hospital

746
01:18:56,111 --> 01:18:57,779
and then going
straight to the police.

747
01:18:57,821 --> 01:18:59,406
-Easy, honey.
-I am not your fucking honey.

748
01:18:59,447 --> 01:19:02,033
And if you think the police
are gonna let you torture kids,

749
01:19:02,075 --> 01:19:03,993
you are sadly mistaken.

750
01:19:06,162 --> 01:19:10,083
Do you think folks around here
give a hoot

751
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:12,669
about a bunch of pervert kids?

752
01:19:12,711 --> 01:19:15,130
I am a man of respect here!

753
01:19:16,339 --> 01:19:19,884
I'm on the goddamn
chamber of commerce.

754
01:19:19,926 --> 01:19:22,012
Now,
you get this kid stabilized.

755
01:19:22,053 --> 01:19:24,180
And tomorrow, you're gone.

756
01:19:53,918 --> 01:19:57,422
-Hey, Cora.
-Hey. How did it go?

757
01:19:57,464 --> 01:20:00,258
-Like always.
-Oh. Did he resist you at all?

758
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:03,094
Hell, no. He was super horny.

759
01:20:03,136 --> 01:20:05,847
He got a little hurt
in the chair, but he'll be fine.

760
01:20:06,514 --> 01:20:08,892
-Just one.
-Come on.

761
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:11,269
Gabriel!

762
01:20:11,311 --> 01:20:15,732
-Please.
-You are such a bad boy.

763
01:20:15,774 --> 01:20:19,277
Just don't let Owen see or I'll
never hear the end of it.

764
01:20:27,285 --> 01:20:30,872
Your laugh.
Look at that. Oh, God.

765
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:36,044
What is that?
Why?

766
01:20:38,505 --> 01:20:41,049
I wanna get a closer look.

767
01:21:03,363 --> 01:21:05,073
Mmm.

768
01:21:21,798 --> 01:21:23,425
Hm-mmm.

769
01:21:31,474 --> 01:21:32,600
Yeah.

770
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,719
No, no, no!

771
01:22:10,013 --> 01:22:11,264
No! Please!

772
01:22:29,908 --> 01:22:31,409
Mmm.

773
01:24:37,744 --> 01:24:39,954
I don't know
what you're talking about.

774
01:24:39,996 --> 01:24:44,250
Shh! Be quiet.

775
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:45,877
We're gonna get in trouble.

776
01:24:45,919 --> 01:24:47,253
No, we're not.

777
01:24:47,295 --> 01:24:48,588
I'm telling you,
we're gonna get in trouble.

778
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:51,466
He said
we can get food any time.

779
01:24:51,508 --> 01:24:53,259
Oh. Do you think
they have liquor?

780
01:24:53,301 --> 01:24:56,179
Oh, what I wouldn't give
for a dirty martini.

781
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:58,515
You are such a rich kid.

782
01:25:20,328 --> 01:25:21,663
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

783
01:25:23,832 --> 01:25:27,168
All right. Listen to me.
I need you to stay together.

784
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:28,545
-Go back to your cabins.
-Fuck that.

785
01:25:28,586 --> 01:25:29,754
We need to get out of here.

786
01:25:29,796 --> 01:25:30,755
Don't you have a satphone?

787
01:25:30,797 --> 01:25:32,173
It's gone.
The satphone is gone.

788
01:25:32,215 --> 01:25:33,967
-Give us the guns.
-You have the rifles.

789
01:25:34,009 --> 01:25:36,511
I'm not giving firearms
to children.

790
01:25:36,553 --> 01:25:38,263
And you need to be quiet!

791
01:25:38,304 --> 01:25:40,306
-And do what I tell you to do.
-No. No more.

792
01:25:40,348 --> 01:25:43,309
You're not telling us
what to do anymore.

793
01:25:43,351 --> 01:25:45,937
Stop it! All of you.

794
01:25:45,979 --> 01:25:47,355
Owen, get the bus.

795
01:25:47,397 --> 01:25:48,732
I need to stay with Stu,
but we can get the others out.

796
01:25:48,773 --> 01:25:50,316
-Where is he?
-He's in the infirmary.

797
01:25:50,358 --> 01:25:51,651
He was hurt.

798
01:25:51,693 --> 01:25:53,319
Toby, wait!

799
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:57,532
Two rifles.
One for me, one for you.

800
01:25:57,574 --> 01:25:59,826
Everyone, go get
some warm clothes on

801
01:25:59,868 --> 01:26:00,994
and meet back here.

802
01:26:01,036 --> 01:26:02,954
Fast as you can. Stay together.

803
01:26:03,455 --> 01:26:04,372
Go!

804
01:26:07,959 --> 01:26:09,085
Don't turn your back on them.

805
01:26:09,127 --> 01:26:10,587
You think one of the kids
did this?

806
01:26:10,628 --> 01:26:13,423
All the counselors are dead.
Open your fucking eyes.

807
01:26:13,465 --> 01:26:16,217
They're not the angels
you think they are.

808
01:27:16,111 --> 01:27:18,988
I am not waiting
around for that psychopath

809
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:20,490
to show up with the bus.

810
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:24,244
No, ma'am. I'm getting out
of here. I will fucking walk.

811
01:27:24,285 --> 01:27:26,538
-You really gonna walk?
-Hell, yes.

812
01:27:26,579 --> 01:27:28,289
Can you take them with you?

813
01:27:29,290 --> 01:27:31,167
It's gonna be safer
if you're together.

814
01:27:31,209 --> 01:27:32,377
We need to get them out of here.

815
01:27:32,419 --> 01:27:33,962
I'm gonna stay here
with Toby and Stu.

816
01:27:34,004 --> 01:27:35,380
Alexandra, are you up for this?

817
01:27:35,422 --> 01:27:36,923
They're scared,
and it's a long way to town.

818
01:27:36,965 --> 01:27:39,801
Honey, please.
I'm a Black transgender woman.

819
01:27:39,843 --> 01:27:42,762
-I could do it in heels.
-My password is 0131.

820
01:27:42,804 --> 01:27:45,640
As soon as you get
in cell range, call the police.

821
01:27:47,225 --> 01:27:50,353
All right, kids, time to go.

822
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:54,774
Come on. Right now.
Step up your pussies.

823
01:27:56,609 --> 01:27:58,653
Stay close to Mamma.

824
01:28:03,658 --> 01:28:07,328
Come on.
All right, stay close to me.

825
01:28:13,251 --> 01:28:15,837
You guys go to the infirmary.
Stay there. Don't leave.

826
01:28:15,879 --> 01:28:17,714
I'm gonna get
that damn generator working,

827
01:28:17,756 --> 01:28:20,008
and I don't trust Owen and Cora.

828
01:28:23,386 --> 01:28:25,138
You go ahead.
I'm gonna go get the rifles.

829
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:27,599
-No!
-This isn't over.

830
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,351
You know that, right?

831
01:28:29,392 --> 01:28:31,811
You go on ahead.
I'll be right behind you.

832
01:28:31,853 --> 01:28:33,688
Do either of you
know how to shoot?

833
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:35,482
Yes.

834
01:28:35,523 --> 01:28:37,484
Of course you do.

835
01:29:12,769 --> 01:29:15,522
Cora!
Where are the goddamn rifles?

836
01:29:17,315 --> 01:29:18,900
Cora!

837
01:30:19,919 --> 01:30:22,088
You don't remember me, do you?

838
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,467
So many kids
have been through here,

839
01:30:25,508 --> 01:30:28,762
how can you be expected
to remember them all?

840
01:30:28,803 --> 01:30:31,806
-Molly, I...
-Oh, no. I'm not Molly.

841
01:30:32,766 --> 01:30:35,060
Molly's dead in her car
on the way here,

842
01:30:35,101 --> 01:30:36,811
so I could take her place.

843
01:30:38,646 --> 01:30:40,648
My name's Angie.

844
01:30:41,733 --> 01:30:44,903
Angie Phelps.
Do you remember her?

845
01:30:45,862 --> 01:30:46,988
Stay down!

846
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,870
No? Angie Phelps. Nothing?

847
01:30:55,705 --> 01:31:00,543
She was only 14...
when you first met her.

848
01:31:01,836 --> 01:31:05,674
She was a good girl... then.

849
01:31:07,509 --> 01:31:10,970
Before all this,
before you put her in that chair

850
01:31:11,012 --> 01:31:15,475
and burned
all the good out of her.

851
01:31:15,517 --> 01:31:18,019
-You must understand...
-No, I mustn't.

852
01:31:18,061 --> 01:31:21,314
No more words,
Owen. No more speeches!

853
01:31:21,356 --> 01:31:24,984
When Angie left here,
it was the suicide attempts,

854
01:31:25,026 --> 01:31:29,364
and the loneliness,
and the self-hatred,

855
01:31:29,406 --> 01:31:35,704
and pills, and the doctors, and,
oh, the anger, so much anger.

856
01:31:37,122 --> 01:31:41,209
I woke up one morning
and realized...

857
01:31:42,711 --> 01:31:45,213
my soul was just hollow.

858
01:31:47,257 --> 01:31:49,759
But you know all about that.

859
01:31:51,886 --> 01:31:54,556
That's what you do to people.

860
01:31:55,598 --> 01:31:57,225
To children.

861
01:31:58,226 --> 01:32:00,895
You hollow them out.

862
01:32:05,233 --> 01:32:07,652
And when all of this comes out,

863
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:11,197
in the news, on TV,

864
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:14,826
all of the bodies,
all the horror of it,

865
01:32:14,868 --> 01:32:21,082
no one will ever send their kids
to a place like this again.

866
01:32:22,542 --> 01:32:26,504
And you, and everyone like you,

867
01:32:26,546 --> 01:32:32,927
will be burning in hell
right next to me.

868
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:42,020
Stop.

869
01:32:43,271 --> 01:32:45,523
Get off her.

870
01:32:55,283 --> 01:32:57,202
Easy now, buddy.

871
01:33:02,415 --> 01:33:04,167
You know what to do, Jordan.

872
01:33:06,169 --> 01:33:07,295
Do it!

873
01:33:09,964 --> 01:33:12,884
Shooting a sick, old dog
is one thing, Jordan.

874
01:33:13,635 --> 01:33:16,388
But shooting a man...

875
01:33:16,429 --> 01:33:21,893
No, sir. I mean, that takes
a certain kind of heart.

876
01:33:22,644 --> 01:33:25,105
You don't know me.

877
01:33:25,146 --> 01:33:27,273
You don't know
anything about me.

878
01:33:27,315 --> 01:33:31,736
Oh, I know everything about you.
I know you're scared.

879
01:33:32,821 --> 01:33:35,615
I know you want this to end.

880
01:33:35,657 --> 01:33:38,243
But not like this, son.
Not like this.

881
01:33:38,993 --> 01:33:41,121
Jordan, you saw the pictures.

882
01:33:41,162 --> 01:33:43,623
All those kids.
All that torture.

883
01:33:43,665 --> 01:33:46,167
You know what he does here.

884
01:33:46,209 --> 01:33:50,714
End this now! You're strong
enough to do this, Jordan.

885
01:34:04,602 --> 01:34:06,229
No.

886
01:34:08,314 --> 01:34:10,650
I'm strong enough

887
01:34:10,692 --> 01:34:13,862
to not do this.

888
01:34:31,629 --> 01:34:37,385
All I did was make those kids
into who they wanted to be.

889
01:34:38,928 --> 01:34:43,641
You made me too.
And this is my truth.

890
01:34:43,683 --> 01:34:46,686
Respect. Renew.

891
01:34:46,728 --> 01:34:49,898
Rejoice. Revenge!

892
01:35:07,082 --> 01:35:11,252
It gets easier. You'll see.

893
01:35:12,796 --> 01:35:15,382
There are so many
camps like this.

894
01:35:15,423 --> 01:35:17,425
We can cleanse them all.

895
01:35:26,017 --> 01:35:27,977
OK.

896
01:35:28,019 --> 01:35:31,231
So, what are we gonna tell them?
We can say he... did it.

897
01:35:31,272 --> 01:35:33,274
-He killed them and we...
-Enough.

898
01:35:35,694 --> 01:35:38,113
No more lies.

899
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:42,200
Where does it end?

900
01:35:42,242 --> 01:35:46,663
When every camp
like this is closed.

901
01:35:46,705 --> 01:35:48,957
When we've killed them all.

902
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:53,837
We could do that, Jordan.
You and me.

903
01:35:59,009 --> 01:36:01,344
You can try to stop me,

904
01:36:01,386 --> 01:36:06,141
but I'm going to go
to my friends now.

905
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:11,813
We're gonna leave this place
and never look back.

906
01:36:11,855 --> 01:36:17,485
And no one is ever going to
tell us who we are ever again.

907
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:21,948
Not him. Not you.

908
01:36:23,533 --> 01:36:25,368
No one.

909
01:36:28,705 --> 01:36:30,957
I'm trying to save you.

910
01:36:35,837 --> 01:36:38,006
No one needs to save me.

911
01:37:39,567 --> 01:37:42,696
-Can I go?
-Are you family?

912
01:37:42,737 --> 01:37:44,489
Yeah. He is.

913
01:38:26,906 --> 01:38:28,450
So,

914
01:38:28,491 --> 01:38:32,203
back to the real world now,
I guess.

915
01:38:32,245 --> 01:38:34,622
What are you gonna tell
your parents?

916
01:38:37,208 --> 01:38:39,127
We'll tell them together.

917
01:38:49,137 --> 01:38:51,139
What about you?

918
01:38:55,518 --> 01:38:57,228
Get emancipated.

919
01:39:02,984 --> 01:39:04,986
Live my life.

920
01:39:08,615 --> 01:39:11,368
You live your best life.

921
01:39:13,661 --> 01:39:15,246
Always.
