[train whistle blowing]

00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,539
[car horn honking]

3
00:00:23,588 --> 00:00:26,765
Each of you must
decide for yourself

4
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:30,204
if this deal can fly.

5
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:33,294
You've read it,
you've taken
a hard look at it.

6
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:36,123
I invite you now
to pick it apart.

7
00:00:38,473 --> 00:00:40,997
Weigh your risk tolerance
against my past performance.

8
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,216
That's all I ask.

9
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:48,352
We've been together 14 years,
let's not blow it now.

10
00:00:48,396 --> 00:00:53,183
Africa offers us
a wealth of opportunities.

11
00:00:53,227 --> 00:00:57,405
Africa is the richest continent
on the face of the earth

12
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:00,103
in natural resources.

13
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:05,326
Why are we not players?

14
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,503
The center, that's
where the power is.

15
00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:10,809
The game is played
from the center out.

16
00:01:10,853 --> 00:01:12,550
Out, that's where we are.

17
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:15,423
On the edges.
In the shadows.

18
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:18,513
Can I guarantee
the outcome? No.

19
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:23,996
I personally believe

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,088
that the upside can be huge.

21
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:32,614
For me, the scope
of this is scary.

22
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:36,139
What the hell do I know
about import export?

23
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:38,576
How come I can't get
it out of my head

24
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,709
that community investors

25
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:44,104
should, for the most part
be investing
in community projects?

26
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:46,323
Look...

27
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:49,544
You know my position.

28
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:53,809
The money game is
the biggest game there is.

29
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:59,510
And I aim to put us
right in the middle of it.

30
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:02,470
We gotta learn
the money game.

31
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:06,430
Better, and better,

32
00:02:06,474 --> 00:02:09,564
and better.

33

[children shouting]

35
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,281
What do you want
to do later?

36
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:42,891
I don't know.
Miss thing
owes me some money.

37
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:46,373
I'm tired of this shit.
I got to get my nails done.

38
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,896
Oh, shit, yo,
there goes Rhonda.

39
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:49,332
I'm gonna go see
what's up with her.

40
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,944
Yo, Rhonda,
what's up?

41
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:56,774
Yo, you can't say hi no more?
You're too good for us now?

42
00:04:56,818 --> 00:04:58,907
Hi. Now get out
of the way, Crystal.

43
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,083
What's your fucking hurry?

44
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:02,737
I got to get to work.

45
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,261
No, no, no.
What you got, bitch,
is your head up in your ass.

46
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,958
You know what I'm saying?

47
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:08,699
What's this bougie shit
you got, yo?

48
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:11,528
- Hey, give it back!
- What's up with that,
 you stupid bitch?

49
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:14,531
Fuck you, stupid slut.
Fuck you!

50
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:15,837
- What?
- Fucking cunt.

51
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,968
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

52
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:18,448
Yo, yo!
Chill! Chill!

53
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:20,320
Rhonda, go on.
Get out of here.

54
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:21,799
Crystal, back up.

55
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:24,541
What? You think you all that
because you wear that dress?

56
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:29,459
She acts like we don't
fucking exist no more! Shit!

57
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:31,766
Stupid ass bitch.

58
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:33,724
She ain't the only one
going places.

59
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:35,117
Crystal, where the hell
we going?

60
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,380
Won't be staying in
Eden the rest of our life.

61
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,124
[laughing]

62
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:51,394
Hey, baby.

63
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,570
Going out?

64
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:54,919
Mm-hmm. Got a date.

65
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:56,399
With Danny?

66
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:57,618
I thought he was history.

67
00:05:57,661 --> 00:05:58,793
He is.

68
00:05:58,836 --> 00:06:01,273
This is somebody new.

69
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:06,627
Nicole, I don't
want to fight.

70
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,721
I can handle it.

71
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:19,509
This new guy seems
very nice.

72
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:21,250
Yeah, that's what
you said about Danny.

73
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:22,904
- Nicole--
- Until he started beating
 the crap out of you.

74
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:24,819
I don't want
to talk about it.

75
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:27,299
Why do you stand for it?

76
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:28,866
I don't know!

77
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,566
I just know I could use
a little bit of niceness
from you.

78
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:33,915
Okay?

79
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:36,570
[sighs]

80
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:38,136
Wish me a good time.

81
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:44,099
I wish you
a good time, Mom.

82
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,494
Don't even say a word.

83
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:49,539
- Oh, no.
- Don't even say a--

84
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,672
I know you love it.
I know you jealous.

85
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:54,022
You've got to tell Fast Freddy
to let me hook you up
with some new gear, girl.

86
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:55,458
That shit looks wack!

87
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:57,417
I got to wear it
if I want to get paid.

88
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:01,551
Thanks for the ride, Boo.

89
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:04,989
- Listen.
- Oh, no. I gotta go.

90
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:05,990
- No, no, no, no.
- Lewis, I'm late.

91
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:07,165
Listen to me, baby.

92
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:08,428
Look into my eyes, all right?

93
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:09,429
Right?

94
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:11,518
You're my girl, right?

95
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:12,519
Yeah.

96
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:13,781
And I want you
to be my woman.

97
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:15,347
I am your woman.

98
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:17,959
No, no, no.
You know what
I'm talking about.

99
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:19,917
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

100
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:22,006
Yeah, give me a kiss.

101
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,138
Bye.

102
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:26,228
Ooh, Nicole.
Gonna tell mama.

103
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:27,490
You late, girl.

104
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:29,013
Freddy, I'm sorry, but--

105
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:31,538
Sorry don't get it, baby.
You be on time next time.

106
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:32,364
Hey, what's happening, y'all?

107
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:33,714
Everything okay?

108
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:35,237
What, you want some
crab juice, baby?

109
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,456
Gary, we need
more fries.

110
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,501
Why don't you
make your own fries?

111
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,155
Thank you.

112
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:41,461
Freddy:
Hey, lookie here.

113
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,593
Oh, no, no.
We don't serve
pig feet here.

114
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,384
â™ª [funk]

115
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:53,690
Hey!

116
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,824
How many times I got
to tell you, boy?

117
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:58,347
Turn the music down.

118
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,175
Aw, man,
I don't know, Freddy.

119
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:02,873
You gotta like,
raise the roof, you know?

120
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,919
Oh, man, we gonna
raise the roof.
Raise the roof.

121
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:06,616
- Aw, man.
- Hey, y'all closing
 by yourself, okay?

122
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,400
All right?

123
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:32,033
Can I help you?

124
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,692
Yeah, man.
You know what
the deal is, though?

125
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:40,868
I kinda really ain't
in the mood for a burger.

126
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:42,478
So how about this.

127
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,959
Why don't you just open up
the fucking register right now?

128
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:46,874
I'm serious!
Open that shit.

129
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,266
Give me the money.

130
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,529
Now!

131
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:50,791
Hey, yo, yo, what's up?
What's happening, man?

132
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,488
[gunshots]

133
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:32,702
[panting]

134
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,896
Oh, my sweet Jesus.

135
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,070
Who are we?

136
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:39,595
What do we stand for?

137
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:44,861
What can we give
our children?

138
00:10:46,254 --> 00:10:48,343
In finding the answer
to these questions,

139
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:51,912
we find the answer
to how we best

140
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:54,915
memorialize
Fred Shepherd.

141
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:59,615
Freddy's death will not
have been in vain

142
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,184
if we, each
and every one of us,

143
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:06,404
reach deep down inside

144
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:08,755
to that fire that
burns in all of us

145
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:13,020
and use it to light the way
to making our lives better...

146
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,807
from this day forward.

147
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,943
This is our community.

148
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:25,380
These are our streets.

149
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:29,427
This is our world.

150
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:35,520
And this is where we have to
stand firm on our own behalf.

151
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:39,133
This is where we
have to seize fate,

152
00:11:39,176 --> 00:11:42,789
shake its tail and
bend it to our will.

153
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:51,493
This is where we must
make every day count.

154
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:01,068
And in doing so, we honor
the best in ourselves.

155
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:07,204
And when we honor the best
in ourselves,

156
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:11,818
we will honor the best
in all the Freddy Shepherds

157
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:14,429
we have lost.

158
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:15,735
Ow!

159
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:48,550
How do you feel?

160
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:51,553
How do you
expect me to feel?

161
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:55,035
You want to talk
about it some more?

162
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:57,385
No.

163
00:12:58,473 --> 00:13:02,433
Yeah, well...

164
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:03,957
What's this world coming to?

165
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:10,920
Fast Freddy dead.

166
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:12,966
Gary dead.

167
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:15,969
Oh.

168
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:18,493
Do me a favor, honey,
make some coffee.

169
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:21,713
Water's on the stove.

170
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:23,411
Thanks, baby.

171
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:27,371
Oh, Jesus.
My head hurts.

172
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:34,074
It seems like it's getting
harder and harder to wake up.

173
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:35,466
It's called a hangover.

174
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:44,780
What's going to
happen with your job?

175
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:47,914
Hmm?

176
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:52,396
I don't know.
Why?

177
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,484
Why?

178
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:55,356
You know why.

179
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,314
Honey, with all the
cutbacks at the hospital.

180
00:13:57,358 --> 00:14:00,056
I'm only on three times
a week, now.

181
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,579
And we can't live
on just my check.

182
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,190
Yeah, okay.

183
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:19,467
[siren]

184
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,338
About 18 to 25, I guess.

185
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,863
Black.

186
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,734
That's half
of south Brooklyn.

187
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:28,258
I know I asked
you yesterday,

188
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:29,781
but can you be
more specific?

189
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:31,348
I know you're scared.

190
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:34,917
He had on, like,
a black jacket

191
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:36,440
with a black cap.

192
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:38,790
He had weird eyes.

193
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:41,358
He was like, you know,
fucked up on something.

194
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:42,272
High.

195
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:43,926
If you remember anything,

196
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,885
anything at all, call us.

197
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:55,024
It was your dad's sweat
and determination
that made it happen.

198
00:14:58,114 --> 00:14:59,115
If you need anything,
let me know.

199
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,508
Okay.

200
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:08,516
- You work here?
- Yep.

201
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,821
Got any work?

202
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:12,259
No, no, we're not looking
for anybody right now.

203
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:13,260
But you could check back.

204
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:15,175
- Nothing?
- No, I'm sorry.

205
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:16,828
I mean, come on.
You've got all these people.

206
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:19,266
- Nothing?
- No, no, but,
 you know, check back.

207
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:21,398
- All right.
- Okay. Good luck to you.

208
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:23,487
You didn't complete
your application form.

209
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:25,576
Were there some questions
you didn't understand?

210
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:29,537
No, I just didn't have time.

211
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,495
I'll take another look at it.

212
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:38,938
I tell you what.

213
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:41,810
Why don't you take it with you
and bring it back tomorrow?

214
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:43,203
Okay?

215
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:45,379
How'd it go?

216
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:47,381
Okay.

217
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:54,475
Did you find anything?

218
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:56,520
No.
I got an application.

219
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:04,964
It's not filled out.

220
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,574
- So?
- So why not?

221
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:08,880
Because they want
a personal statement,

222
00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:10,317
and I ain't got
nothing to say, that's why.

223
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,667
Oh, Nicole, honey,
make something up.

224
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,507
You don't know how
to fill it out, do you?

225
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,987
Do you?

226
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:31,947
Do you?

227
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,080
I ain't heard you say
nothing about no career goals.

228
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:35,472
Yeah, well,
I got 'em.

229
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:37,474
Oh, yeah? I got 'em too, ma.
It's not to be like you.

230
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:38,693
[gasps]

231
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh, baby.
Vickie, I'm sorry!

232
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,305
Honey, I--

233
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:59,235
I can't get another job.

234
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,107
Not anywhere.

235
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:05,459
Even Kentucky Fried
has a waiting list.

236
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:08,592
I can't get another job
because I don't know nothing.

237
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:10,377
Of course you know stuff, baby.

238
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,336
I don't know anything
anybody would pay me to know.

239
00:17:14,337 --> 00:17:16,122
I don't want to end up like--

240
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:17,253
Like me?

241
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:19,212
Go ahead, say it.
Like me?

242
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:23,390
You sound just like
your fucking grandmother.

243
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:37,404
[horn blaring]

244
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:12,047
Yes?

245
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,179
Is Mr. Cleamons in?

246
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:14,310
Cleamons:
Who is it, Ola?

247
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:15,398
I don't know.

248
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,358
Hi.

249
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:22,101
Bet you don't
remember me, huh?

250
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:24,668
[laughs]

251
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:25,887
You were my teacher.

252
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:30,021
No, I can't say
that I do.

253
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:31,501
Sure you do.
Come on.

254
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,288
How did you
get my address?

255
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:37,246
I'm Nicole Turner.

256
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:40,684
I used to work
at Fast Freddy's.

257
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:43,165
I called Fred Jr.
and he told me
how I could reach you.

258
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:45,820
Oh, well,
I, uh--

259
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:49,302
Mr. Cleamons, come on.
You don't remember me?

260
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:51,913
3rd Grade at Washington.

261
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:53,567
Nicole Turner.

262
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,004
- No, Miss--
- Nicole Turner.

263
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:57,397
I don't.

264
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,355
- Now I have something to--
- I know. I know.

265
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,879
You've got work to do,
and I don't mean to 
take up your time.

266
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:03,707
Yes, well,
it's nice meeting you,

267
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:06,362
and, uh...
Goodbye.

268
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:10,366
I quit high school,
Mr. Cleamons.

269
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,933
I didn't learn nothing.

270
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:13,239
I don't know nothing.

271
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:14,631
Miss, you're blocking
my door.

272
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:19,114
I heard you speak
at the funeral the other day.

273
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,856
I want to make my life
mean something, Mr. Cleamons.

274
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:23,640
I want to learn.

275
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:27,035
Well, good for you,
but this clearly has
nothing to do with me.

276
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:29,255
I want you to help me.

277
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:31,561
I want you to
teach me things.

278
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:33,781
- You what?
- Teach me things.

279
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:37,132
Like what you said
about honoring Mr. Freddy.

280
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,481
I want to know stuff.

281
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:42,616
Well--

282
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,970
Look, miss, the fact
of the matter is,

283
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:50,711
I am no longer a teacher,

284
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:52,626
and I haven't been for
a number of years.

285
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:54,802
Will, what's going on?
We have to get going.

286
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:56,282
Won't be a minute, Wendy.
Won't be a minute.

287
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:59,372
You'll have to
excuse me now.

288
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:03,114
You just going
to dis me like that?

289
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:05,595
Man, I thought that speech
meant something,

290
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:07,510
but I guess it was
nothing but words.

291
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:16,389
Look...

292
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:22,221
if you want to
continue this discussion,

293
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:25,006
you'll call me
at my office.

294
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:36,278
Five or six people
still have their doubts?

295
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:40,674
And as for outright resistance,
two, maybe three, you say?

296
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:45,026
What the hell is wrong?

297
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:46,767
Why don't they get it?

298
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,291
Hey, they're bright,
intelligent,

299
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:50,597
successful people, Will.

300
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,990
Self-made, every one of them.
Just like you.

301
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:54,427
They get it.

302
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,474
So what do you say?

303
00:20:58,518 --> 00:21:01,085
That I'm the one
not getting something?

304
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:03,436
- Is that it?
- Damn right.

305
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:07,091
I mean, you've traded in
your compassion for--

306
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:08,876
Oh, bullshit.

307
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:10,791
I've not changed.

308
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:11,966
Bullshit!

309
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:14,577
I've watched you, step by step.

310
00:21:17,101 --> 00:21:20,279
You think I think
life's all about money.

311
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,715
- Yes.
- I don't.

312
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:24,500
I think it's mostly
about money.

313
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:26,850
Well, what about ethics?
And morals?

314
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:29,375
Take money out of the mix,
the world stops dead,

315
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:32,203
and so does ethics and morals.

316
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:34,162
You're looking at life
through different eyes.

317
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:38,340
We've crossed a lot
of rivers together, Joe,

318
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:40,211
but I won't go back
to where you think

319
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:42,562
I might have made a wrong move
and fix anything.

320
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:44,694
Try. You might
surprise yourself.

321
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:47,349
There are no
surprises back there.

322
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:49,264
No, no surprises.

323
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,876
Just a lot of unfinished
business waiting to be settled.

324
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,748
Like your ex-wife, Desiree.

325
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,445
You've never even
talked to her.

326
00:21:59,143 --> 00:22:01,320
My past life

327
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:02,538
is my concern.

328
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,194
Stay the hell
out of it, Joe.

329
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:12,026
I'm here to see
Mr. Cleamons.

330
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:13,114
One moment.

331
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:14,376
Conditioning.

332
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,378
It's holding you
too close to home.

333
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:18,380
We've got to break loose.

334
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:20,382
And what about those
who can't keep up?

335
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:22,079
They're going to
get left behind.

336
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:26,257
You've got to break a few eggs
to make an omelet, Joe.

337
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:28,390
And don't give me that look.

338
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:30,566
I know exactly
how it sounds.

339
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,352
And exactly what I'm saying.

340
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:36,137
Yeah, money talks.
The ends justify the means.

341
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,617
And if it comes to it,

342
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,270
you're even willing to
break me to make your omelet.

343
00:22:39,314 --> 00:22:40,359
That's what you're saying.

344
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:41,751
Tell him I'm here.

345
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:43,536
I'm sorry, but if you
don't have an appointment--

346
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:45,799
He knows me.
Trust me.

347
00:22:45,842 --> 00:22:47,366
No, no, no, I'm afraid
you'll have to leave.

348
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,280
- Hey!
- Oh, shit.

349
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:50,630
Who's that?

350
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:52,153
It's nobody.

351
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:57,854
Sorry, Mr. Cleamons,
I thought she was a messenger.

352
00:22:57,898 --> 00:22:58,986
It's all right, Johnnie.

353
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:00,248
She's here to see me.

354
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:03,294
[clears throat]

355
00:23:03,338 --> 00:23:04,687
How long have you
been standing out here?

356
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:07,734
I didn't want to disturb you
while you were talking.

357
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,173
You said to talk
to you at your office.

358
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:13,827
I said call me
at my office.

359
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,089
Oh.

360
00:23:15,132 --> 00:23:17,874
This is an old friend
of mine, George Sherman.

361
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:19,789
- Sherman this is--
- Nicole Turner.

362
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:20,877
Nicole.

363
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,444
She worked
for Fast Freddy.

364
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:24,577
Y'all work here with
all these white folks?

365
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:27,318
Don't they make you nervous?

366
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:29,320
No, on the contrary.

367
00:23:29,364 --> 00:23:32,019
I think sometimes Mr. Cleamons
makes them nervous.

368
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:35,892
Yeah, makes them feel
like they gotta watch
what they say, right?

369
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,113
That's probably why
they got you cooped up
in this fancy office.

370
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:42,508
And I always thought it was
because I'm a senior partner.

371
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:45,075
Okay, Nicole,
where were we?

372
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,904
It's like I told you,
Mr. Cleamons.

373
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:50,429
I want to know things.

374
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,474
What do you think
about giving me some lessons?

375
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:53,997
Like I told you, Nicole,

376
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,346
I ain't no teacher anymore.

377
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,218
Yeah, but, Mr. Cleamons,

378
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:58,828
I'm stuck.

379
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:01,440
And being stuck
just ain't no good.

380
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:07,881
No, being stuck
just ain't no good.

381
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:11,058
Where do you
live, Nicole?

382
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:12,451
Brooklyn.

383
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:15,149
In the Eden Garden
housing complex.

384
00:24:16,237 --> 00:24:18,457
- Been there long?
- All my life.

385
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,285
My grandma lived there
till she got enough
money to move,

386
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:22,504
'cause she and my mom,
they don't get along.

387
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:23,549
They don't talk no more.

388
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:25,246
What about your father?

389
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,511
Nah, just me and my mom
live there right now.

390
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:30,512
You know about Eden?

391
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:33,341
Yeah, I know
about Eden.

392
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:34,734
Hey, nice to meet you.

393
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:35,735
Yeah.

394
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:36,997
Would you excuse us
for a minute?

395
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:48,965
She wants to learn
and you say she's hopeless?

396
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:50,924
That's the way it is.

397
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,755
Look, we'll pick up
where we left off later.

398
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:58,105
Why can't you
tutor her, Will?

399
00:24:58,148 --> 00:25:02,239
Oh, for Christ's sakes, Joe.

400
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:04,285
With the years of
education missing there,

401
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:07,027
the gap's too wide
for tutoring to fill.

402
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,637
The odds are against it.

403
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:11,248
Believe me.
Major, major effort, that.

404
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:15,426
Yeah, about as major as me
convincing the others

405
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,298
to get on board
and ride with you

406
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:20,083
into this new megadeal
you've got in mind.

407
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,047
I'll be willing to
give it my best shot.

408
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:33,662
Best shot for best shot?

409
00:25:38,232 --> 00:25:39,538
So?

410
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:42,410
How 'bout it,
Mr. Cleamons?

411
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:50,200
I will try
to teach you.

412
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:51,245
Yeah?

413
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:54,814
But it'll cost you.

414
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:58,034
Cost me?

415
00:25:58,078 --> 00:25:59,383
How much?

416
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:03,257
- $10 an hour.
- $10 an hour?

417
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,215
Aw, man.

418
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:10,220
Consider it an investment
in your future.

419
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,397
Okay.

420
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:15,878
Okay.

421
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:20,404
Then we start on Saturday,
about 10 A.M., sharp.

422
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,412
I believe you know
where I live.

423
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:31,633
All right.

424
00:26:47,344 --> 00:26:48,955
- Good morning.
- Hey, how you doing?

425
00:26:48,998 --> 00:26:50,478
Fine, thank you.

426
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:00,619
Sure is a big place.

427
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:03,186
You live here
all alone?

428
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,014
Yes, Nicole,
I do.

429
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:06,233
Yeah?

430
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:07,669
You don't got
a wife, or nothing?

431
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:11,412
No, I don't have
a wife, or anything.

432
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,071
What is this?

433
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:21,074
Your own personal library?

434
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:22,162
You got a librarian, too?

435
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:24,686
This is my sanctuary, Nicole.

436
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:34,261
Do you know what the word
visualize means?

437
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:37,264
Sort of.

438
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:38,787
Well, think of
something important

439
00:27:38,831 --> 00:27:40,354
that's happened to you.

440
00:27:40,397 --> 00:27:41,660
A special event, say.

441
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:43,879
Okay?

442
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:45,141
Can you see it?

443
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:46,447
Yeah.

444
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,233
Sure, it's like
a picture in my mind.

445
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:55,021
The mind is
used for many things

446
00:27:55,064 --> 00:27:56,718
and one of the most
important is

447
00:27:56,762 --> 00:28:01,201
to visualize and store
information as images.

448
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:02,506
That's how we learn.

449
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:07,555
Okay, now I'll take you back
and we'll start
at the beginning.

450
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:08,817
What beginning?

451
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:10,340
Before you were born.

452
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:12,255
Before I was born.

453
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:15,171
Before the earth was formed.

454
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:18,305
Before the solar system
was created.

455
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:24,572
Before the galaxies
and the universe were born.

456
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:25,747
That beginning.

457
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,749
Do you know what it was called?

458
00:28:29,403 --> 00:28:30,404
No.

459
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:33,015
The big bang.

460
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:34,756
How long ago was that?

461
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,934
15, 18 billion years.

462
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:40,196
Shit.

463
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,851
That's a long time ago.

464
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:47,334
Yes.

465
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:50,467
We will visualize
what science says happened

466
00:28:50,511 --> 00:28:55,124
from that moment on up
to the moment you came
into this life.

467
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:58,780
One of the most powerful pieces
of information you can own

468
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,347
is a sense of history--

469
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,697
history of the universe
as a whole,

470
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,526
the galaxies within it,

471
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:08,616
of the solar system within
our milky way galaxy,

472
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:10,618
of planet Earth in
that solar system,

473
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:12,794
of the nations
on that planet,

474
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:15,231
of the people
in those nations,

475
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:17,712
your people from Africa
to America

476
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,715
to this glorious state
to this troubled city

477
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,762
to the very place
where you were born.

478
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:26,808
That beginning.

479
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,464
Wow.

480
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:33,684
You don't need much
breath to talk, huh?

481
00:29:35,295 --> 00:29:37,514
Know whence you came, Nicole.

482
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:40,256
For if you know
whence you came,

483
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,129
there's really no limit
to where you can go.

484
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:02,801
Hey, Mr. Cleamons.

485
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,412
Good morning.

486
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:08,154
What are we going
to do today?

487
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,988
You like asking
questions, don't you?

488
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:22,255
Do you ever wonder if?

489
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:23,604
If what?

490
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:28,348
Do you ever
wonder why?

491
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:30,176
Why what?

492
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:33,135
Do you ever
wonder how?

493
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:36,269
How what?
This is a lesson, right?

494
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:38,358
Do you ever wonder where?

495
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:43,145
I don't get it.

496
00:30:47,236 --> 00:30:48,977
What do you wonder
about, Nicole?

497
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,072
I don't know.

498
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:00,859
Not much, I guess.

499
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:04,514
Bad answer.

500
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:13,175
I dub thee
from this day forward
a thinking individual.

501
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:14,437
Hey, hey!

502
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:16,004
You're messing up my hair!

503
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:17,223
I just had my do did.

504
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:22,315
Your "do did?"

505
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:25,144
You mean you've just
had your hair done.

506
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:26,275
Yeah.

507
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,538
And after it's done,
it's did, right?

508
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:31,280
I just had my do did.

509
00:31:31,324 --> 00:31:34,153
The book on your head
is so that learning
stays on your mind.

510
00:31:34,196 --> 00:31:37,373
And in the process it will
help to improve your posture.

511
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:39,375
Posture, that's the first
word I want you to look up.

512
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:40,420
You slouch.

513
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:42,770
Hey, I ain't no slouch!

514
00:31:42,813 --> 00:31:46,252
I didn't say
you were a slouch,
I said you do slouch.

515
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:48,384
Your grammar is horrible.

516
00:31:48,428 --> 00:31:50,560
Can you tell me what a noun,
a verb, a pronoun,

517
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:52,345
and an adjective all are?

518
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:55,435
No.

519
00:31:55,478 --> 00:31:56,915
But you're going
to teach me, right?

520
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,221
No, you're going
to teach yourself.

521
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:01,049
Look those things up
in your new dictionary.

522
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:02,921
As a thinking individual,

523
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:07,055
you should constantly
be wondering,

524
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:10,319
constantly be
asking questions.

525
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:16,935
What should I wonder about?

526
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:20,068
Everything.

527
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,952
[no audible dialogue]

528
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:43,787
[bell ringing]

529
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,574
Yo, Merry Christmas.

530
00:32:47,617 --> 00:32:50,185
Lewis, you gotta
read some of this.

531
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:52,622
- I got some sandwiches.
- This is unbelievable.

532
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,189
- I got some sodas.
- Mr. Cleamons gave me
 this book.

533
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:56,235
Will you just read
this one part?

534
00:32:56,278 --> 00:32:57,758
- Come on.
- I'm telling you,
 you would love it.

535
00:32:57,801 --> 00:33:00,282
- Lewis!
- Tell me about it
 on the way.

536
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:01,675
There you are, my lady.

537
00:33:01,718 --> 00:33:04,591
Pure, authentic Louisiana
jambalaya made from...

538
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:07,637
I'll give you one minute
to give me an answer

539
00:33:07,681 --> 00:33:10,945
as to how many books
there are in here.

540
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,817
It'll take me a lot longer
than a minute to count
all these books.

541
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:16,472
Then I guess you'll have to
figure out a better way

542
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:20,041
to get an answer than by
counting the books one by one.

543
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:21,695
Like how?

544
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:23,218
I don't get it.

545
00:33:23,262 --> 00:33:25,090
Of course you don't.

546
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:30,486
Because you are not thinking.

547
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,488
Consider this a test.
Begin.

548
00:33:52,117 --> 00:33:53,988
I'm not finished yet.

549
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,556
Then, my dear, you'll have
to make an educated guess.

550
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:59,559
If I was going to guess,
I wouldn't have counted
in the first place.

551
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:02,388
Then you'd be wearing
your ignorance on your sleeve.

552
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:07,088
Always arm yourself with as
much information as possible.

553
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:08,742
But you didn't
give me enough time.

554
00:34:08,785 --> 00:34:11,310
Nicole,

555
00:34:11,353 --> 00:34:14,835
sometimes in life there
just isn't enough time,

556
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:17,098
and at those times,
you must guess.

557
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:18,360
And in this instance,

558
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:21,102
you must guess because
you weren't quick enough.

559
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:27,674
You might as well attempt
to make an educated guess.

560
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:29,893
Understand?

561
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:32,505
- Multiply.
- Yes.

562
00:34:46,388 --> 00:34:48,129
2560.

563
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:53,003
Was I close?

564
00:34:53,047 --> 00:34:55,441
I don't know.
I've never counted.

565
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:57,704
[laughs]

566
00:34:57,747 --> 00:35:00,141
Okay, on the count of three,
I want you to suck in your gut.

567
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:01,795
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

568
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:03,101
Ooh!

569
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,972
- Breathe.
- Pull!

570
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:06,974
[grunting]

571
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:09,237
- Breathe!
- Pull!

572
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:10,108
Okay, okay.

573
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:11,935
- Oh, God.
- You got it.

574
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:13,546
- Up.
- Woo!

575
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:15,548
Okay.

576
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:18,203
I can't breathe,
but my ass looks good.

577
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:20,205
[laughs]

578
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:22,642
Damn, girl.

579
00:35:22,685 --> 00:35:24,122
I was beginning to think
you weren't going

580
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,340
to be hanging out with us.

581
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:27,255
I thought you
were dissing us,

582
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:30,215
being that your nose was all up
in them books and whatnot.

583
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:31,216
I missed you.

584
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:32,478
I missed you, too.

585
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:34,132
We're going to
party tonight, though.

586
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:35,481
Yeah!

587
00:35:35,524 --> 00:35:37,657
â™ª I miss you, darling,
I miss you, darling â™ª

588
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:42,836
â™ª I wish you was with me

589
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:47,145
â™ª 'Cause I need you here...

590
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:48,320
I didn't think you
were going to show up tonight.

591
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:50,278
Yeah, I've had a lot
of work to do.

592
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:52,585
Aw, shit, baby,
I've got a surprise for you.

593
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:53,803
What?

594
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:56,763
My brother, he's out of town.

595
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:58,199
We got the whole
place to ourselves.

596
00:35:58,243 --> 00:36:00,070
What's up?
You up for a little
private study hall?

597
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:03,378
Uh, yeah.

598
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:18,915
What's up, kid?

599
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:21,091
Who we got here?

600
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:23,659
Taurus, this is Nicole.
Nicole, this is Taurus.

601
00:36:23,703 --> 00:36:25,270
How you doing?

602
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:27,141
Hi, how you doing?

603
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,405
You know, man, you know.
I'm doing everything.

604
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:33,234
Yo, check it out, you know.

605
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:35,149
You get tired
of my man Lewis,

606
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,672
you just come
and see me, 'aight?

607
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:38,152
Just playing, man.

608
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,067
Yeah.

609
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,504
[rapping continues]

610
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:44,027
[laughing]

611
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:45,464
Sorry, homie, man.

612
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:47,117
Who the fuck
you calling homie, man?

613
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:48,641
- Huh?
- Punk!

614
00:36:48,684 --> 00:36:50,208
You don't know me, punk!

615
00:36:51,818 --> 00:36:53,167
[grunts]

616
00:36:54,951 --> 00:36:56,605
I'll kill you,
motherfucker!

617
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:59,217
Let me put it clear!

618
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,784
Come here, bitch.

619
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:18,279
Let's get out of here.

620
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:22,370
Lewis, how well
you know Taurus?

621
00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:24,067
- Taurus?
- Yeah.

622
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:25,504
What do you want
to know about him for?

623
00:37:25,547 --> 00:37:27,157
- Especially now?
- I just do.

624
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:28,681
How well you know him?

625
00:37:28,724 --> 00:37:30,552
Farrell knows him.
He says he knows him
from the old days.

626
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:32,075
They used to hang together
sometimes.

627
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,817
Lewis, I've got
stuff on my mind.

628
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:37,124
Look, listen, Nicky,

629
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:39,082
let me put your
mind at ease, all right?

630
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:41,520
All we doing is
messing around, okay?

631
00:37:41,563 --> 00:37:43,652
It ain't no different than
nothing we done before.

632
00:37:43,696 --> 00:37:45,567
Yes, it is.
And look at this place!

633
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:46,960
It's a dump!

634
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:48,831
The light's still on.
It ain't romantic!

635
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,355
- It's dirty.
- You want romantic?

636
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:53,532
[flicking lighter]

637
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:01,235
Yo, Nicky, what the hell
is wrong with you, man?

638
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,845
Why can't you talk to me?

639
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:04,282
Talk to you?

640
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,674
Yeah, talk to me.

641
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:08,155
Can't you see
something's bothering me?

642
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:09,461
Hey, man, all right.
I'll cut the lights out.

643
00:38:09,504 --> 00:38:11,201
It ain't the lights
that's the problem!

644
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:13,595
I know, damn it.
You the fucking problem.

645
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,164
Here.

646
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:29,872
Yeah, girl.

647
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,004
Oh.

648
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:33,789
You, come on over here.

649
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,443
Mother:
Nicole just came in.
Shh.

650
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:37,880
[laughing]

651
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:42,145
- Morning.
- Good morning.

652
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:46,411
[laughs]

653
00:38:46,454 --> 00:38:47,803
What is all this?

654
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:49,022
Take a look.
Take a look.

655
00:38:57,117 --> 00:38:59,293
Look at all the faces.

656
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,990
Carefully.

657
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:09,825
Then I want you to take down
the ones that you know.

658
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:12,524
'Aight.

659
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:17,267
Tiger Woods.

660
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:18,268
Tiger Woods.

661
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:20,401
This cat makes
so much money.

662
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:21,881
Ella Fitzgerald, you know?

663
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:23,709
- Nope.
- No.

664
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:27,234
I know him.

665
00:39:27,277 --> 00:39:28,540
- Martin Luther King.
- Yeah.

666
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:32,282
Bob Marley, obviously I know.

667
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:33,806
Bob Marley.

668
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:34,850
Who's this guy?

669
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:36,286
[laughs]

670
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,419
Michael Jordan, yes, yes.

671
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:41,770
Um... I don't know them.

672
00:39:49,212 --> 00:39:51,563
You should know
all of these people.

673
00:39:51,606 --> 00:39:54,914
They have all had
an impact on your life.

674
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:56,611
Well, I don't.

675
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:59,135
I mean, I know
they famous and stuff,

676
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:01,268
but I don't see what
they got to do with me.

677
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:03,357
'Specially these foreign
looking people.

678
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,969
Before that old man
up there died,

679
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:09,885
he ruled over
a country in which

680
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:12,105
one fifth of the Earth's
people live.

681
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:15,630
That's one in every five
persons on the planet.

682
00:40:15,674 --> 00:40:16,979
Think about that.

683
00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:20,200
And that woman there

684
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:21,593
changed the course
of American history

685
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:25,205
simply by refusing to give up
her seat on a bus.

686
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:29,557
Okay, what about
the rest of them?

687
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:30,776
You tell me.

688
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,780
[doorbell ringing]

689
00:40:34,823 --> 00:40:36,042
Figure out who you want
to tell me about first.

690
00:40:36,085 --> 00:40:37,826
I'll be right back.

691
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,574
Oh, God.
Wendy.

692
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:49,011
The antique auctions
at Christie's.

693
00:40:49,055 --> 00:40:52,711
That's right,
and you forgot.

694
00:40:52,754 --> 00:40:54,800
Wendy, I really am sorry.

695
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:58,238
But the thing is--

696
00:40:58,281 --> 00:41:00,196
The thing is--

697
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,285
The thing is

698
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:05,027
you seem to care more about
this girl than you do about us.

699
00:41:05,071 --> 00:41:06,725
I'd like her to go.

700
00:41:06,768 --> 00:41:08,988
Wendy, she's my student.

701
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:11,730
Wendy:
No, I want her
to go now.

702
00:41:11,773 --> 00:41:14,210
This is what killed things
between you and Desiree.

703
00:41:14,254 --> 00:41:15,473
No wonder your marriage
fell apart.

704
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:19,041
You don't know anything
about Desiree.

705
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:22,436
Wendy:
I know what
happened to her.

706
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,090
And I know what
a giant shadow

707
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:26,875
she cast over--
still casts over
your entire life.

708
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:28,529
Hola,Ola.

709
00:41:28,573 --> 00:41:29,617
Hi.

710
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:31,053
You finished for the day?

711
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:32,228
Yeah.

712
00:41:32,272 --> 00:41:33,447
Mm, these are nice.

713
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,275
Mm-hmm.

714
00:41:37,973 --> 00:41:40,062
I heard Desiree's beautiful.

715
00:41:40,106 --> 00:41:42,108
- She is.
- Yeah.

716
00:41:45,415 --> 00:41:47,374
It's too bad
what happened, though.

717
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:49,637
Yeah, it's a shame.

718
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:53,902
So, you knew her well?

719
00:41:53,946 --> 00:41:55,730
Oh, yeah.

720
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:57,166
We went to
the same church.

721
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,690
- She got married there.
- Yeah?

722
00:41:58,733 --> 00:41:59,821
Mm-hmm.

723
00:41:59,865 --> 00:42:01,867
So do you ever run into her?

724
00:42:02,868 --> 00:42:04,957
Child, you don't know, do you?

725
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,133
What?

726
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:09,178
She's in jail, honey.

727
00:42:09,222 --> 00:42:12,225
She killed her second husband.

728
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:46,694
Mom?

729
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:50,176
Mom?

730
00:43:17,464 --> 00:43:18,596
[humming]

731
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:21,033
Ruthie, you ever
been in jail?

732
00:43:23,078 --> 00:43:24,384
Girl, you know
the answer to that.

733
00:43:24,427 --> 00:43:25,994
What's wrong with you?

734
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:28,475
Where you getting stuff
like that from?

735
00:43:28,518 --> 00:43:30,869
Mr. Cleamons?
Heh!

736
00:43:30,912 --> 00:43:32,218
Nah.

737
00:43:32,261 --> 00:43:35,395
Nah, I was just wondering
about women in jail.

738
00:43:35,438 --> 00:43:37,136
Thought you might
know something about it.

739
00:43:37,179 --> 00:43:39,312
Yeah, well, I don't.

740
00:43:43,098 --> 00:43:47,494
But I do know that
it's hell for men, so,

741
00:43:47,537 --> 00:43:49,496
it's probably worse for women.

742
00:44:14,347 --> 00:44:16,915
Step off the bus.
Wait over here.

743
00:44:18,046 --> 00:44:19,831
Hi.

744
00:44:24,618 --> 00:44:25,663
Do I know you?

745
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:27,708
No.

746
00:44:27,752 --> 00:44:29,101
Do you know me?

747
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:30,319
No.

748
00:44:30,363 --> 00:44:31,930
So let me ask you,

749
00:44:31,973 --> 00:44:33,235
who are you, and
why are you here?

750
00:44:33,279 --> 00:44:35,194
My name is Nicole Turner,
and I came--

751
00:44:35,237 --> 00:44:36,674
You're doing some research
on battered women

752
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:38,588
and I'm exhibit A?

753
00:44:38,632 --> 00:44:40,155
No, wait.
Wait, no!

754
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:42,070
I just--
I just wanna talk.

755
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:43,115
No, I have nothing to say.

756
00:44:43,158 --> 00:44:44,420
- Guard!
- Please!

757
00:44:44,464 --> 00:44:47,206
Look, don't go.
I didn't mean to offend you.

758
00:44:47,249 --> 00:44:49,512
It's just, I sat on
that bus for hours, right?

759
00:44:49,556 --> 00:44:51,210
And I got all these
questions, like--

760
00:44:51,253 --> 00:44:53,560
That question
has already been settled.

761
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:55,083
Like, why did you do it?

762
00:44:55,127 --> 00:44:58,304
Why didn't you leave him?
Why did you fight back?

763
00:44:58,347 --> 00:44:59,348
Guard?

764
00:44:59,392 --> 00:45:01,568
How come my mother doesn't,

765
00:45:01,611 --> 00:45:04,136
and why did you
and Mr. Cleamons split up?

766
00:45:05,877 --> 00:45:07,226
Did you say Mr. Cleamons?

767
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:09,837
As in Will Cleamons?

768
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:13,058
You're here because
of Will Cleamons?

769
00:45:13,101 --> 00:45:14,581
Yeah.
No.

770
00:45:14,624 --> 00:45:15,756
Yes and no.
It's just--

771
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,888
What the hell
does Will want?

772
00:45:16,931 --> 00:45:19,020
To see if I'm suffering?
Well, I'm not.

773
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:23,764
You go back
and you tell him I'm okay.

774
00:45:23,808 --> 00:45:26,941
You tell him that
Desiree is just fine.

775
00:45:26,985 --> 00:45:29,727
And fuck him.

776
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,816
Fuck Will Cleamons.

777
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:34,122
Make sure you
tell him that.

778
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:36,298
He doesn't know I'm here.

779
00:45:36,342 --> 00:45:38,213
[buzzer]

780
00:45:39,214 --> 00:45:41,173
Fuck.

781
00:45:46,352 --> 00:45:48,354
[cocks gun]

782
00:45:48,397 --> 00:45:49,659
[gunshot]

783
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,509
So...

784
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:18,210
have you decided which one
you'll tackle first?

785
00:46:21,387 --> 00:46:23,128
Who effected your
life the most?

786
00:46:24,129 --> 00:46:25,652
Was it one of them?

787
00:46:27,567 --> 00:46:30,309
Or was it your wife?

788
00:46:30,352 --> 00:46:32,050
How about that?

789
00:46:32,093 --> 00:46:33,660
You were married,
weren't you?

790
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:37,185
Nicole, spend
your time wondering

791
00:46:37,229 --> 00:46:38,534
about other things
besides me.

792
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:42,016
But I want
to wonder about you.

793
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,062
Like, why did you
and she split up?

794
00:46:44,105 --> 00:46:45,803
Because.

795
00:46:45,846 --> 00:46:46,804
Because?

796
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:52,157
Because is neither an answer
nor is it a complete sentence,

797
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,160
nor is it a verb,
which is an action word

798
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:58,163
or a noun, which is
a person, place or thing.

799
00:46:58,206 --> 00:47:00,861
It's not even an adjective,
which describes stuff.

800
00:47:00,905 --> 00:47:02,602
So there.

801
00:47:02,645 --> 00:47:05,170
But it will have to do.

802
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,001
Was she the love
of your life?

803
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:16,137
Nicole, things change.

804
00:47:16,181 --> 00:47:17,443
My life changed.

805
00:47:17,486 --> 00:47:18,923
End of conversation.

806
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:21,839
Now if you want
something to wonder about,

807
00:47:21,882 --> 00:47:23,797
wonder about this.

808
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,016
I can't do this.

809
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:26,713
I don't take
good tests.

810
00:47:26,756 --> 00:47:28,062
It's not a test.

811
00:47:28,106 --> 00:47:29,672
It's just information for me,

812
00:47:29,716 --> 00:47:31,805
so I'll know what skills
you need to concentrate on.

813
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,415
Now begin!

814
00:47:40,422 --> 00:47:41,859
So?

815
00:47:41,902 --> 00:47:42,990
How'd I do?

816
00:47:45,123 --> 00:47:48,082
Possess your soul
in patience, child.

817
00:47:50,215 --> 00:47:52,217
I like that.

818
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,874
Possess your soul
in patience.

819
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:58,484
I should write
that down, huh?

820
00:48:00,573 --> 00:48:02,792
We have a lot of work to do.

821
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:06,709
Now, let's finish
what we started.

822
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:08,233
Paul Robeson.

823
00:48:08,276 --> 00:48:11,323
The idea of my concert
is that all men are brothers

824
00:48:11,366 --> 00:48:12,672
because of their music.

825
00:48:12,715 --> 00:48:16,415
And in my first group,
I do an old English song

826
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:18,983
and then I do a Bach Chorale

827
00:48:19,026 --> 00:48:21,333
and then I create slight
confusion by doing

828
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:23,074
a Negro spiritual
right in the middle

829
00:48:23,117 --> 00:48:24,989
because it belongs there.

830
00:48:25,032 --> 00:48:28,470
And I found that out by going
back to Africa, for example.

831
00:48:28,514 --> 00:48:30,864
[singing in foreign language]

832
00:48:49,013 --> 00:48:50,057
Hey.

833
00:48:50,101 --> 00:48:51,972
- Hey, girl.
- What's going on?

834
00:48:52,016 --> 00:48:53,234
Nicky...

835
00:48:53,278 --> 00:48:55,845
I'm late.

836
00:48:55,889 --> 00:48:57,630
Late for what?

837
00:48:57,673 --> 00:48:59,501
My period.

838
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,114
Are you sure?

839
00:49:03,157 --> 00:49:04,854
Yeah, pretty sure.

840
00:49:04,898 --> 00:49:06,291
Shit.

841
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:07,988
You better go
to a doctor.

842
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:11,296
I know.

843
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:18,999
How's work?

844
00:49:19,043 --> 00:49:20,958
Same old, same old.

845
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:24,265
You have breakfast?

846
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:25,353
Yeah, I just ate.

847
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:26,441
Why, want me
to make you something?

848
00:49:26,485 --> 00:49:27,790
Mm-mm.

849
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:35,102
- Oh.
- Ruthie!

850
00:49:35,146 --> 00:49:37,670
Be careful!
Look what you did.

851
00:49:37,713 --> 00:49:39,106
Well, I'm sorry.

852
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,194
Jeez.

853
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:45,112
Ain't you ever going
to find another job?

854
00:49:45,156 --> 00:49:49,073
Yeah. Eventually,
I'll look for another job.

855
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:52,772
But, it's "aren't" I going
to look for another job.

856
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:56,080
Oh, aren't, ain't.

857
00:49:56,123 --> 00:49:57,907
Couldn't, can't.

858
00:49:57,951 --> 00:49:59,474
Who cares?

859
00:49:59,518 --> 00:50:02,260
Eventually ain't gonna keep
us off welfare, Nicole.

860
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:04,131
- I know.
- Oh, you know.

861
00:50:04,175 --> 00:50:06,046
Well, I know
you should know

862
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:07,352
to get a job

863
00:50:07,395 --> 00:50:09,354
instead of wasting your
money on these lessons.

864
00:50:09,397 --> 00:50:10,790
Now that's what I know.

865
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:13,445
Look, Ruthie, I paid
for these lessons, all right?

866
00:50:13,488 --> 00:50:16,013
I saved my money.
They're for me.

867
00:50:21,453 --> 00:50:23,063
Listen.

868
00:50:23,107 --> 00:50:26,675
Something just opened up
at the hospital.

869
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:30,027
It's housekeeping nights.

870
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,985
You know, cleaning bed pans,
making beds,

871
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,508
that sort of thing.

872
00:50:33,552 --> 00:50:36,076
Now, don't you even try to cut
your eyes at me, young lady.

873
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,122
Maybe that kind of work is
too low class for you

874
00:50:38,165 --> 00:50:40,167
now that you've got your head
buried in them goddamn books

875
00:50:40,211 --> 00:50:42,213
that's costing money
you ought to be using

876
00:50:42,256 --> 00:50:43,910
to help me keep up this house.

877
00:50:43,953 --> 00:50:47,174
Well, this--this job
is good enough for me.

878
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:54,051
Do you hear me?

879
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,488
I said do you--

880
00:50:56,531 --> 00:50:59,186
I hear you!
I hear you.

881
00:51:01,797 --> 00:51:03,799
- We need to see you
 again in two weeks.
- Yeah.

882
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:13,374
What did they say?

883
00:51:13,418 --> 00:51:15,420
I'm pregnant.

884
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:19,076
It's okay.

885
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,425
Come on.

886
00:51:37,137 --> 00:51:38,095
Who's that?

887
00:51:40,575 --> 00:51:42,186
Don't worry about it.

888
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:48,627
Lewis, what the hell
is going on here?

889
00:51:50,542 --> 00:51:51,847
Nothing.

890
00:51:51,891 --> 00:51:54,198
I don't hear from you.
You don't return my calls.

891
00:51:54,241 --> 00:51:55,460
Nothing.

892
00:51:55,503 --> 00:51:57,070
Fuck that. Maybe if you
wasn't so busy

893
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,159
with Mr. Cleamons, you would
have got some of my messages.

894
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,163
[sigh]

895
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:04,338
I can't even talk to you.

896
00:52:04,382 --> 00:52:05,861
Fine, then.
Fuck you, then.

897
00:52:05,905 --> 00:52:07,646
When you want to talk,
give me a call.

898
00:52:09,691 --> 00:52:10,910
Don't worry about it

899
00:52:13,956 --> 00:52:16,481
Yo, I'm not trying to
get in the middle of nothing,

900
00:52:16,524 --> 00:52:19,223
but it looks like to me
that you need a new man.

901
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:20,267
What's up?

902
00:52:20,311 --> 00:52:21,790
Thanks for the tip.

903
00:52:21,834 --> 00:52:23,227
Hold up, come on.
Let me talk to you
for a second.

904
00:52:24,271 --> 00:52:25,490
What's the matter?

905
00:52:25,533 --> 00:52:27,535
I see how you be
looking at me, Nicole.

906
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:28,754
When are we gonna hang out?

907
00:52:28,797 --> 00:52:30,147
We're not, all right?

908
00:52:31,496 --> 00:52:34,020
- Hey, leave me alone.
- What?

909
00:52:35,021 --> 00:52:38,155
Damn, you a man's woman.

910
00:52:38,198 --> 00:52:41,375
See, now, Lewis might have
had the glue to catch you,

911
00:52:41,419 --> 00:52:44,987
he ain't got the strength
to hold you.

912
00:52:45,031 --> 00:52:46,511
See, you need a man
with some strength.

913
00:52:47,512 --> 00:52:48,861
Somebody like me, maybe.

914
00:52:48,904 --> 00:52:50,950
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

915
00:52:50,993 --> 00:52:53,082
Sounds to me like
some bullshit.

916
00:52:53,126 --> 00:52:54,867
Hey.

917
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:56,912
You like to talk, don't you?

918
00:52:56,956 --> 00:52:58,436
Oh, no, no, no.
Come here. Come here.

919
00:52:59,437 --> 00:53:01,221
Let me tell you something.

920
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:04,137
I'm a whole lot
more than talk.

921
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:07,009
Now go on, take your sweet
little ass back to Eden.

922
00:53:07,053 --> 00:53:08,794
Remember who's who.

923
00:53:08,837 --> 00:53:11,100
'Aight?

924
00:53:11,144 --> 00:53:11,971
Now you can go.

925
00:53:13,451 --> 00:53:14,974
Go on, get the fuck
out of here.

926
00:53:17,063 --> 00:53:19,979
Bye, Nicole.

927
00:53:20,022 --> 00:53:22,286
Good-bye.

928
00:53:22,329 --> 00:53:24,549
Sweetie pie,
look at you.

929
00:53:24,592 --> 00:53:26,115
Go on home.

930
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:27,508
Bye-bye.

931
00:53:27,552 --> 00:53:29,206
See you.

932
00:53:36,169 --> 00:53:38,998
Something bothering
you, Nicole?

933
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:40,260
You want to talk?

934
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:43,611
Because if you don't
want to do the lesson...

935
00:53:43,655 --> 00:53:44,656
No.

936
00:53:44,699 --> 00:53:46,048
Let's do it.

937
00:53:55,014 --> 00:53:56,798
Adolf Hitler.

938
00:53:59,975 --> 00:54:03,240
Mr. Cleamons, why didn't
somebody smoke his ass

939
00:54:03,283 --> 00:54:05,198
when he started that shit?

940
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:07,766
You tell me.

941
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:11,204
Man, that punk was trippin'.

942
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,337
He had too much power.

943
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,469
And who gave it to him?

944
00:54:15,513 --> 00:54:17,558
People did.

945
00:54:19,386 --> 00:54:21,562
You know, they knew
he was a liar.

946
00:54:21,606 --> 00:54:23,738
They knew he was a fake.

947
00:54:23,782 --> 00:54:25,523
And they're supposed to do
something about it,

948
00:54:25,566 --> 00:54:27,089
and they didn't.

949
00:54:28,134 --> 00:54:29,962
They didn't.

950
00:54:30,005 --> 00:54:34,140
No, they didn't
and you've brought us
to the word responsibility,

951
00:54:34,183 --> 00:54:36,838
- which means--
- I know what it means.

952
00:54:39,972 --> 00:54:42,061
Nicole, what's eating you up
so much today?

953
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:44,150
Nothing.
It's nothing.

954
00:54:44,193 --> 00:54:48,241
It's family stuff.
Boyfriend stuff, you know.

955
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,808
Could we talk
about something else?

956
00:54:51,592 --> 00:54:53,420
Like what?

957
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:55,683
How about Desiree?
Can we talk about her?

958
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:00,471
No.

959
00:55:03,256 --> 00:55:05,737
Did you all have children?

960
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:09,915
Why are you so interested
in my affairs?

961
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:13,048
Well, you told me
to wonder about everything

962
00:55:13,092 --> 00:55:15,921
so I wonder what happened
to you and Desiree.

963
00:55:22,144 --> 00:55:25,931
She left me.

964
00:55:25,974 --> 00:55:28,629
Why?

965
00:55:28,673 --> 00:55:31,806
Get out of my life!

966
00:55:33,242 --> 00:55:36,942
Why do you keep asking
questions about her?

967
00:55:36,985 --> 00:55:39,292
It is none of
your damn business!

968
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,250
Understand?

969
00:55:41,294 --> 00:55:42,687
Look...

970
00:56:00,095 --> 00:56:05,840
the relationship is
I teach.

971
00:56:05,884 --> 00:56:10,671
I teach and you learn.

972
00:56:13,195 --> 00:56:19,376
We may discuss history
but not my history.

973
00:56:19,419 --> 00:56:20,942
Understand?

974
00:56:20,986 --> 00:56:22,988
Yes.

975
00:56:25,207 --> 00:56:26,339
Have I made myself clear?

976
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,994
Have I made myself clear?

977
00:57:30,055 --> 00:57:31,839
- Yeah?
- Mrs. Turner?

978
00:57:31,883 --> 00:57:34,015
- My name is--
- I know who you are.

979
00:57:34,973 --> 00:57:38,106
[baby crying]

980
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:39,891
I wonder if
Nicole is here.

981
00:57:39,934 --> 00:57:42,241
No, she's not.

982
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:45,331
Do you know where
I might find her?

983
00:57:45,374 --> 00:57:46,811
Mr. Cleamons.

984
00:57:48,116 --> 00:57:50,336
Where is Nicole
going to go, hmm?

985
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:51,990
What's she gonna do?

986
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:54,688
I appreciate the time
that you're spending
with my daughter,

987
00:57:54,732 --> 00:57:56,647
but do you have to be
filling her head with dreams

988
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:58,997
that I know won't come true?

989
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,520
I don't know that.

990
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:03,784
I don't want her
to be hurt.

991
00:58:06,918 --> 00:58:09,094
She's working at the hospital.

992
00:58:09,137 --> 00:58:11,488
Kings County.

993
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:20,453
[sobbing]

994
00:58:27,895 --> 00:58:29,375
I'm looking for
Nicole Turner.

995
00:58:29,418 --> 00:58:31,116
She's right behind you.

996
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:36,077
- Not now.
- Sorry, I'll come back.

997
00:58:37,296 --> 00:58:39,472
Nicole?

998
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,995
We have a lesson today.

999
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:43,215
Well, I blew it off.

1000
00:58:43,258 --> 00:58:44,259
I see.

1001
00:58:44,303 --> 00:58:45,565
Well, my time is valuable.

1002
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:47,654
You just can't
blow off a lesson.

1003
00:58:47,698 --> 00:58:49,526
Therefore, you owe me.

1004
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:51,484
$10.

1005
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,746
Payable now.

1006
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:54,661
I owe you $10?

1007
00:58:54,705 --> 00:58:56,881
I didn't know you
were so hard up for cash.

1008
00:58:56,924 --> 00:58:58,230
I'm not.

1009
00:58:58,273 --> 00:59:00,014
I know.

1010
00:59:00,058 --> 00:59:02,713
But you have a commitment,
as have I.

1011
00:59:02,756 --> 00:59:04,845
That's a part of it.
The word is--

1012
00:59:04,889 --> 00:59:07,065
Responsibility.
I know what the word is.

1013
00:59:07,108 --> 00:59:09,154
Come on, I'll get you
your precious money.

1014
00:59:10,372 --> 00:59:12,461
Why am taking these
stupid lessons, anyway?

1015
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:14,463
I mean, what's the point?

1016
00:59:14,507 --> 00:59:17,466
I'm losing my friends.
I lost my boyfriend--

1017
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:18,859
Shit!

1018
00:59:18,903 --> 00:59:20,252
You should have told me!

1019
00:59:20,295 --> 00:59:22,515
What? That learning
would complicate your life?

1020
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,995
That it would
change your life?

1021
00:59:24,038 --> 00:59:25,562
You knew that's
what you wanted.

1022
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:27,564
That's why you
pursued me.

1023
00:59:27,607 --> 00:59:31,393
That's why you made me
change my life.

1024
00:59:31,437 --> 00:59:32,960
What have you done?

1025
00:59:33,004 --> 00:59:35,267
I don't see anything.

1026
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:37,486
I swore I'd never
teach again.

1027
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:40,359
I was finished!

1028
00:59:40,402 --> 00:59:41,665
No more bureaucracy.

1029
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:43,623
No more banging my head
against the stone wall.

1030
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:46,800
No more chasing down students
because of a paper

1031
00:59:46,844 --> 00:59:48,715
they wrote on Paul Robeson.

1032
00:59:50,499 --> 00:59:52,066
Oh, no.

1033
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:54,025
You got that
look on your face.

1034
00:59:54,068 --> 00:59:55,635
Shit.
You hate it.

1035
00:59:59,465 --> 01:00:01,467
The thing is,
Mr. Cleamons,

1036
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:03,208
I couldn't get with it
at first, you know?

1037
01:00:03,251 --> 01:00:07,734
It's like, great actor,
great singer, great athlete.

1038
01:00:07,778 --> 01:00:09,257
Why'd he go to Russia?

1039
01:00:09,301 --> 01:00:11,999
Then I kept reading,
and I got the answer.

1040
01:00:12,043 --> 01:00:13,261
Racism.

1041
01:00:14,523 --> 01:00:16,482
But then the man comes back.

1042
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:17,918
Why'd he do that?

1043
01:00:17,962 --> 01:00:20,965
Because--
I think because

1044
01:00:21,008 --> 01:00:24,621
America was his home.

1045
01:00:24,664 --> 01:00:25,970
That's what I think.

1046
01:00:26,013 --> 01:00:28,581
You always go home.

1047
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:32,585
Nicole.

1048
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,414
Your paper was excellent.

1049
01:00:35,457 --> 01:00:37,982
I want you to take the GED.

1050
01:00:39,505 --> 01:00:40,854
The GED?

1051
01:00:40,898 --> 01:00:43,465
Yes.

1052
01:00:43,509 --> 01:00:45,467
You could get a diploma.

1053
01:00:45,511 --> 01:00:46,817
You could go to college.

1054
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:49,036
You could do anything!

1055
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,690
Nicole, I don't
want to lose you.

1056
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:52,997
I mean, I've--

1057
01:01:05,618 --> 01:01:08,708
Look, I'm not saying
it's going to be easy.

1058
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:10,144
But you're the one.

1059
01:01:10,188 --> 01:01:12,581
I mean, you are the one
who wanted your life changed.

1060
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:15,280
Yeah, but Mr. Cleamons,
come on.

1061
01:01:15,323 --> 01:01:17,108
To take the GED?

1062
01:01:18,631 --> 01:01:20,677
I mean, that test
is definitely hard.

1063
01:01:29,294 --> 01:01:31,339
- You gonna help me?
- No.

1064
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:34,255
You are going to--

1065
01:01:34,299 --> 01:01:35,604
- help yourself.
- help myself.

1066
01:01:35,648 --> 01:01:36,736
I know.

1067
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:39,217
[laughs]

1068
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:41,088
God, you never
change, do you?

1069
01:01:41,132 --> 01:01:42,133
No.

1070
01:01:43,612 --> 01:01:48,269
Maya Angelou:
Study. Study.
Put it in the brain.

1071
01:01:48,313 --> 01:01:52,534
This machine will do
anything for you.

1072
01:01:52,578 --> 01:01:54,101
Anything.

1073
01:01:54,145 --> 01:01:57,496
It will take you to China
if you want to go.

1074
01:01:57,539 --> 01:02:00,107
It will take you to New York
if you want to go.

1075
01:02:00,151 --> 01:02:03,894
Somebody is going to make
laws for this entire land.

1076
01:02:03,937 --> 01:02:05,678
Is it going to be you?

1077
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,462
Is it going to be you?

1078
01:02:07,506 --> 01:02:10,509
The chance is there.
It's so exciting.

1079
01:02:10,552 --> 01:02:12,772
You have a chance.

1080
01:02:14,513 --> 01:02:17,472
I have you in my heart.
I see myself in you.

1081
01:02:17,516 --> 01:02:19,997
I hope you see
yourselves in me.

1082
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:38,711
Yeah, right on.

1083
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,365
18 big ones.
All right.

1084
01:02:40,408 --> 01:02:43,716
- Yo, Nicky.
- Crack it like that.

1085
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,239
See?

1086
01:02:45,283 --> 01:02:47,502
And then, of course, you
use this to take it out.

1087
01:02:47,546 --> 01:02:48,547
Whoa!

1088
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:50,375
I'm sorry.

1089
01:02:50,418 --> 01:02:52,986
I'm so sorry, Mr. Cleamons.

1090
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:54,335
It's quite all right.

1091
01:02:54,379 --> 01:02:56,250
Quite all right,
my dear, my dear.

1092
01:02:56,294 --> 01:02:58,296
When you open the claw,
you got to scoop--

1093
01:02:58,339 --> 01:03:00,211
Why you gotta dig it out?
This is stupid.

1094
01:03:00,254 --> 01:03:02,169
Because--
Crystal, look.

1095
01:03:02,213 --> 01:03:04,302
Instead of-- look.
See what I'm doing?

1096
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:05,607
See what I'm doing?
Look at that.

1097
01:03:05,651 --> 01:03:08,523
Go Nicky!
It's your birthday!

1098
01:03:08,567 --> 01:03:10,525
It's your birthday!
Go Nicky!

1099
01:03:10,569 --> 01:03:12,484
Go Nicky!
It's your birthday!

1100
01:03:12,527 --> 01:03:14,312
- Woo!
- All right!

1101
01:03:14,355 --> 01:03:16,923
- Happy birthday, Nicky.
- Happy birthday.

1102
01:03:16,967 --> 01:03:18,229
18, girl.
You made it.

1103
01:03:18,272 --> 01:03:19,883
- Make a wish.
- Make it a good one.

1104
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:25,018
Aw, happy birthday, girl.

1105
01:03:27,455 --> 01:03:29,370
Okay, so, what else
do you want?

1106
01:03:30,632 --> 01:03:33,244
Uh, just a little time.
A few answers.

1107
01:03:33,287 --> 01:03:35,376
I mean, you do got
some time, right?

1108
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:37,814
You're not going
anywhere, are you?

1109
01:03:37,857 --> 01:03:40,207
[laughing]

1110
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:42,035
Why did Will
quit teaching?

1111
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,559
You didn't ask him?

1112
01:03:44,603 --> 01:03:46,997
Nah, no.
I thought that--

1113
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,434
Well, there was a boy
named Michael Ferguson.

1114
01:03:49,477 --> 01:03:52,350
He was a very bright,
smart, special boy,

1115
01:03:52,393 --> 01:03:56,354
and Will tried to
save him from--

1116
01:03:56,397 --> 01:03:57,964
The streets.

1117
01:03:58,008 --> 01:03:59,966
The world.

1118
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:02,360
Michael was trouble.
There was nothing
Will could have done.

1119
01:04:02,403 --> 01:04:04,579
But he blamed himself anyway.

1120
01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:09,062
Will always had a good
eye for investments.

1121
01:04:11,586 --> 01:04:13,893
[buzzer]

1122
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:15,416
Time's up?

1123
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,288
It's like that.

1124
01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:25,687
Girls:
â™ª One, two, three, four

1125
01:04:25,731 --> 01:04:27,341
â™ª Five, six

1126
01:04:27,385 --> 01:04:28,734
[laughing]

1127
01:04:45,011 --> 01:04:47,100
Shit.

1128
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:02,637
Ruthie!

1129
01:05:02,681 --> 01:05:04,770
Ruthie?

1130
01:05:04,813 --> 01:05:06,337
Where's my money?

1131
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:09,253
Did you take my money?

1132
01:05:09,296 --> 01:05:11,211
Did you or didn't you?

1133
01:05:11,255 --> 01:05:12,517
I borrowed it.

1134
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,561
Ruthie!

1135
01:05:13,605 --> 01:05:14,736
Baby, I needed it,
so I took it.

1136
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:17,478
Ruthie, that money
was for my lessons.

1137
01:05:17,522 --> 01:05:18,392
All right?

1138
01:05:18,436 --> 01:05:20,394
Why did you do that?

1139
01:05:20,438 --> 01:05:21,656
Mama's neighbor called!

1140
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,354
Mama's sick,
mama's very sick.

1141
01:05:23,397 --> 01:05:25,573
I don't want her to
see me looking bad, Nicole!

1142
01:05:25,617 --> 01:05:27,532
So I borrowed the money.

1143
01:05:27,575 --> 01:05:29,447
Honey, I wanted her
to be proud of me.

1144
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:30,535
Look, see?

1145
01:05:36,193 --> 01:05:38,195
[sighs]

1146
01:05:38,238 --> 01:05:41,328
Honey, I'm not drunk.

1147
01:05:41,372 --> 01:05:43,287
I don't want to be drunk.

1148
01:05:44,984 --> 01:05:47,595
That's why I don't feel good.

1149
01:05:51,556 --> 01:05:55,429
I want to be sober when
I make peace with me mother.

1150
01:06:14,187 --> 01:06:17,974
I don't have the money for my
lesson today, Mr. Cleamons.

1151
01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:20,498
The envelope is empty.

1152
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:27,418
Then why did you
put it on my desk?

1153
01:06:27,461 --> 01:06:31,813
Because I wanted to finish
my lesson before I told you.

1154
01:06:31,857 --> 01:06:35,165
It's just I have to know
so much for my test.

1155
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:37,732
Then why do you
tell me now?

1156
01:06:41,432 --> 01:06:42,824
I don't know,
I don't know.

1157
01:06:42,868 --> 01:06:45,218
I just--

1158
01:06:45,262 --> 01:06:48,221
My mother needed the money
for an emergency.

1159
01:06:48,265 --> 01:06:50,136
My grandmother
is really sick.

1160
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,964
I'm sorry, Nicole.

1161
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,444
Really sorry.

1162
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:54,793
You want to postpone
the lesson?

1163
01:06:56,882 --> 01:06:59,058
Well, open your notebook,

1164
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:01,017
and don't worry
about the money.

1165
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:04,020
We'll deal with that later.

1166
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,065
That's it?

1167
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:08,328
I was so scared, you know?

1168
01:07:08,372 --> 01:07:12,245
I mean-- I didn't want you
to think I was making
no excuses.

1169
01:07:12,289 --> 01:07:13,507
You told me the truth?

1170
01:07:13,551 --> 01:07:14,639
Yeah.

1171
01:07:14,682 --> 01:07:17,033
Well, the truth
is never an excuse.

1172
01:07:18,251 --> 01:07:19,948
Hmm.

1173
01:07:24,475 --> 01:07:26,607
I know what you always say.

1174
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:31,221
You know, you've got to break
a few eggs to make an omelet?

1175
01:07:33,397 --> 01:07:36,617
You scare me when
you say that, you know?

1176
01:07:36,661 --> 01:07:41,013
I mean, but the more I thought
about it all these months,

1177
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,755
the more I am coming to see
that you may be right.

1178
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:47,063
I want that kind
of strength, Mr. Cleamons.

1179
01:07:47,106 --> 01:07:51,980
You never let weak-minded people
stop you or hold you back.

1180
01:07:52,024 --> 01:07:54,287
You just went out,
you got whatever you wanted,

1181
01:07:54,331 --> 01:07:55,941
and if somebody
got in your way,

1182
01:07:55,984 --> 01:07:58,378
well, hey,
it's on them, you know?

1183
01:07:58,422 --> 01:07:59,423
I know that's what it takes.

1184
01:07:59,466 --> 01:08:02,600
I know that that's
how I gotta be.

1185
01:08:03,905 --> 01:08:06,343
That's why I was
scared coming here,

1186
01:08:06,386 --> 01:08:08,345
because I don't--

1187
01:08:08,388 --> 01:08:11,739
I just don't want you thinking
that I'm making any excuses

1188
01:08:11,783 --> 01:08:14,307
because I know
what you expect of me.

1189
01:08:14,351 --> 01:08:17,180
And that's not what
life is about, is it?

1190
01:08:21,793 --> 01:08:25,753
Maybe we should skip
the lesson for today.

1191
01:08:29,061 --> 01:08:31,455
Tell me about you.

1192
01:08:32,456 --> 01:08:34,327
Did Paul care about you?

1193
01:08:34,371 --> 01:08:36,112
Well, yes he did.

1194
01:08:37,287 --> 01:08:39,898
Well, in the beginning,
I thought he did.

1195
01:08:42,205 --> 01:08:44,772
Later, he became a rapist
who was practicing at home.

1196
01:08:44,816 --> 01:08:46,383
So you...

1197
01:08:50,952 --> 01:08:53,085
He was drunk.

1198
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,914
And he became abusive.

1199
01:08:55,957 --> 01:08:58,569
He said, "You won't
make it through the night."

1200
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:01,833
He grabbed me by the hair
with one hand

1201
01:09:01,876 --> 01:09:05,706
and with the other he shoved
the barrel of a gun in my mouth.

1202
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,969
I tried to scream,
but nothing would come out.

1203
01:09:08,013 --> 01:09:10,494
Just choking sounds.

1204
01:09:11,538 --> 01:09:13,149
He was yelling.

1205
01:09:13,192 --> 01:09:15,455
"Shut the fuck up, bitch."

1206
01:09:15,499 --> 01:09:17,631
Then he took the gun
out of my mouth,

1207
01:09:17,675 --> 01:09:21,374
and hit me in
the head with it.

1208
01:09:23,637 --> 01:09:26,118
When I came to, he was
passed out on top of me.

1209
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:28,773
So I reached for
the gun beneath him

1210
01:09:28,816 --> 01:09:31,906
but he woke up,

1211
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,476
grabbed me by the throat,

1212
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,131
and before I knew it,
I'd shot him.

1213
01:09:40,524 --> 01:09:41,655
Dead.

1214
01:09:41,699 --> 01:09:43,527
You had to do it.
He would've killed you.

1215
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:47,444
Well, try telling
that to the court.

1216
01:09:52,536 --> 01:09:54,929
You're afraid of a lot of
things, aren't you, Nicole?

1217
01:09:58,629 --> 01:10:01,284
Well, let me tell you.

1218
01:10:01,327 --> 01:10:07,115
After that moment, I have
never been afraid of anything.

1219
01:10:15,036 --> 01:10:16,429
Yo, girl, you gotta
take care of this mess

1220
01:10:16,473 --> 01:10:18,126
quick now, okay?

1221
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:19,302
- Yo, here comes Nicky.
- Hey, what is it?

1222
01:10:19,345 --> 01:10:20,694
What's going on?

1223
01:10:20,738 --> 01:10:23,610
She gotta go to the doctor
and get rid of this baby.

1224
01:10:23,654 --> 01:10:24,698
What?

1225
01:10:24,742 --> 01:10:25,873
Teresa, is that
what you want?

1226
01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:27,397
I don't know, okay?

1227
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,268
Well, did you tell Hector?
I mean, he's the father, right?

1228
01:10:29,312 --> 01:10:31,052
Yeah, of course, but--

1229
01:10:31,096 --> 01:10:33,446
Shit, who is you?
A freaking social worker,
or something?

1230
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:35,753
All of a sudden, you know
everything around here.

1231
01:10:35,796 --> 01:10:37,842
Did he say anything?

1232
01:10:37,885 --> 01:10:38,930
Hector doesn't know.

1233
01:10:38,973 --> 01:10:40,540
And even if he did,

1234
01:10:40,584 --> 01:10:43,282
it doesn't matter what he
thinks, Miss Planet Parenthood.

1235
01:10:43,326 --> 01:10:45,284
It matters, Crystal.
It fucking matters.

1236
01:10:45,328 --> 01:10:46,285
He's the father!

1237
01:10:46,329 --> 01:10:47,721
Whatever.

1238
01:10:47,765 --> 01:10:49,419
Don't--No.
Don't sweat me.

1239
01:10:49,462 --> 01:10:50,898
I am not Rhonda, okay?

1240
01:10:50,942 --> 01:10:53,379
- Fuck you, okay?
- No, fuck you.

1241
01:10:53,423 --> 01:10:55,468
Fuck you and fuck him
and these no good ass men.

1242
01:10:55,512 --> 01:10:56,643
Come on.

1243
01:10:56,687 --> 01:10:58,471
Teresa, you better
think about this.

1244
01:10:58,515 --> 01:11:00,517
This is like a decision
that's going could effect you

1245
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:01,648
for the rest of your life!

1246
01:11:03,694 --> 01:11:05,261
Teresa?

1247
01:11:05,304 --> 01:11:06,262
Teresa!

1248
01:11:11,571 --> 01:11:12,616
Yeah, that'd be great.

1249
01:11:12,659 --> 01:11:14,444
Yeah.
Take care.

1250
01:11:16,184 --> 01:11:17,447
Rhonda?

1251
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:18,926
- Hi.
- Hi.

1252
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:20,406
Going back to school?

1253
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:21,451
Sorta.

1254
01:11:21,494 --> 01:11:22,452
I'd like to
talk to you.

1255
01:11:22,495 --> 01:11:23,670
About what?

1256
01:11:23,714 --> 01:11:25,498
You're a paralegal, right?

1257
01:11:25,542 --> 01:11:27,370
So?

1258
01:11:27,413 --> 01:11:28,327
What have you done?

1259
01:11:28,371 --> 01:11:30,590
Not me.
Not me.

1260
01:11:30,634 --> 01:11:33,332
A woman in prison
I know needs some help.

1261
01:11:33,376 --> 01:11:34,420
Can you help me?

1262
01:11:34,464 --> 01:11:36,466
- Yeah, I think so.
- Yeah?

1263
01:11:36,509 --> 01:11:38,250
Do you want to go for
coffee, maybe?

1264
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,165
We can talk about
the case a little bit more?

1265
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:41,253
Yeah, that'd be great.

1266
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,298
I have this whole
file of stuff that,

1267
01:11:42,341 --> 01:11:44,343
like, if you could
just look at it,

1268
01:11:44,387 --> 01:11:46,389
I mean, I don't really
know what to do with it.

1269
01:11:46,432 --> 01:11:47,738
Okay.

1270
01:11:47,781 --> 01:11:50,262
Yes, I remember
the case very well.

1271
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,873
She was messed over
by the system, Miss Baker.

1272
01:11:54,135 --> 01:11:56,224
Well, some we've
gotten clemency,

1273
01:11:56,268 --> 01:11:57,661
and some we've
gotten new trials,

1274
01:11:57,704 --> 01:11:59,619
and some, we've gotten
nowhere at all.

1275
01:11:59,663 --> 01:12:01,317
It all depends.

1276
01:12:07,105 --> 01:12:08,411
Morning, Nicole.

1277
01:12:08,454 --> 01:12:10,021
Morning.

1278
01:12:10,064 --> 01:12:12,458
So, who's missing?

1279
01:12:12,502 --> 01:12:14,417
No one, Mr. Cleamons.

1280
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:15,374
Oh?

1281
01:12:15,418 --> 01:12:16,897
Didn't have time?

1282
01:12:16,941 --> 01:12:19,247
No, it's just that you
didn't have a picture up

1283
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:20,336
of the person
I wanted to learn about.

1284
01:12:22,033 --> 01:12:24,078
And who might that be?

1285
01:12:24,122 --> 01:12:26,342
Well, I thought
that it would be nice

1286
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:28,996
if you had a picture of woman
who made it on the wall

1287
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,564
not because of her fame,
but because of her misfortune

1288
01:12:31,608 --> 01:12:33,871
in honor of those
who have suffered

1289
01:12:33,914 --> 01:12:36,482
but still manage to survive.

1290
01:12:36,526 --> 01:12:37,788
Maybe I should.

1291
01:12:37,831 --> 01:12:41,400
Did you know that
the governor of Ohio

1292
01:12:41,444 --> 01:12:43,663
granted clemency
to 26 women

1293
01:12:43,707 --> 01:12:46,623
convicted of murder or assault
on the basis of self-defense?

1294
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:49,408
I'm aware of that.

1295
01:12:49,452 --> 01:12:52,411
And now, in New York

1296
01:12:52,455 --> 01:12:56,415
you can show that
a battered woman is a victim.

1297
01:12:58,548 --> 01:13:01,333
I talked to this lawyer
and she met with Desiree

1298
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,030
and she's agreed
to help her.

1299
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:12,779
Don't you think
an injustice was done?

1300
01:13:12,823 --> 01:13:14,302
I don't know.

1301
01:13:14,346 --> 01:13:17,741
The jury decided
she was guilty.

1302
01:13:17,784 --> 01:13:21,614
Yeah, but what if
the jury decided wrong?

1303
01:13:21,658 --> 01:13:24,095
That has happened
in New York, right?

1304
01:13:24,138 --> 01:13:25,618
Then may God bless her.

1305
01:13:25,662 --> 01:13:27,533
God bless her?

1306
01:13:27,577 --> 01:13:29,056
That's all?

1307
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:31,232
I know you've got feelings.
I know you do.

1308
01:13:31,276 --> 01:13:32,233
- Look--
- No!

1309
01:13:32,277 --> 01:13:33,496
Don't you wonder about her?

1310
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:35,541
Don't you wonder
about how she's doing?

1311
01:13:35,585 --> 01:13:39,153
Man, you've got me
wondering about everything

1312
01:13:39,197 --> 01:13:41,373
from Pushkin
to Harriet Tubman.

1313
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:44,028
Don't you wonder
about Desiree?

1314
01:13:50,687 --> 01:13:51,775
[sighs]

1315
01:13:51,818 --> 01:13:53,385
Look at this library.

1316
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,431
Your sanctuary.

1317
01:13:56,997 --> 01:13:58,303
You know, when you first
used that word,

1318
01:13:58,346 --> 01:14:00,566
I didn't know
what it meant.

1319
01:14:00,610 --> 01:14:03,047
But I know now.

1320
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:06,311
This is your sanctuary
from life.

1321
01:14:06,354 --> 01:14:10,837
And that's sad
because it's beautiful

1322
01:14:10,881 --> 01:14:13,666
and you got no one 
to share it with.

1323
01:14:55,447 --> 01:14:57,884
Your best shot.
Remember those words?

1324
01:14:57,928 --> 01:14:59,407
I'm keeping up
my end of the bargain.

1325
01:14:59,451 --> 01:15:00,844
What the hell is
happening with you?

1326
01:15:00,887 --> 01:15:02,759
Still trying to
make up, aren't you?

1327
01:15:02,802 --> 01:15:04,674
You can't make up for her

1328
01:15:04,717 --> 01:15:06,763
or for what her suffering
has cost the both of you.

1329
01:15:08,025 --> 01:15:10,767
This deal is not where
you're stuck, my brother.

1330
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:12,290
You're stuck back there,

1331
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:14,118
back where your life
shut down.

1332
01:15:14,161 --> 01:15:16,294
Now, nothing is going
to happen with this deal

1333
01:15:16,337 --> 01:15:19,253
until our friends
make up their minds.

1334
01:15:19,297 --> 01:15:21,212
And nothing is going
to get right with your life

1335
01:15:21,255 --> 01:15:23,954
until you make up
your mind.

1336
01:15:37,663 --> 01:15:39,099
Go, go, go!

1337
01:15:39,143 --> 01:15:40,536
Hurry up!
We're going to
be late, man!

1338
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:42,712
Hey, Nicole.

1339
01:15:42,755 --> 01:15:44,322
What are you looking at?

1340
01:15:44,365 --> 01:15:46,454
I seen you.

1341
01:15:46,498 --> 01:15:49,153
Yeah, you're looking
at me all the time.

1342
01:15:49,196 --> 01:15:50,720
What's up with
that, Nicole?

1343
01:15:50,763 --> 01:15:52,460
Hmm?

1344
01:15:52,504 --> 01:15:55,986
Nothing.

1345
01:15:56,029 --> 01:15:57,204
Come on.

1346
01:15:57,248 --> 01:15:58,989
Let me know something.

1347
01:16:00,425 --> 01:16:02,427
Yeah, keep looking.

1348
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:06,605
You see, you look.
Sooner or later, you're going
to have to touch.

1349
01:16:06,649 --> 01:16:09,216
Hear me?

1350
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:11,828
Yeah, you hear me.

1351
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,273
'Sup?

1352
01:16:25,058 --> 01:16:27,670
And no is a word
I don't take kindly to.

1353
01:16:29,367 --> 01:16:32,196
Will, I'm sorry.

1354
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:34,067
I just don't know.

1355
01:16:36,156 --> 01:16:38,289
What is it
you don't know, Frank?

1356
01:16:40,465 --> 01:16:43,816
I need all of you,
not just some of you.

1357
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:45,296
And time is running out.

1358
01:16:45,339 --> 01:16:47,864
Look, we're a family.
We've been together 14 years.

1359
01:16:47,907 --> 01:16:49,735
Let's not blow it now.

1360
01:16:52,085 --> 01:16:53,043
[door opens]

1361
01:16:53,086 --> 01:16:54,044
Mr. Cleamons.

1362
01:16:54,087 --> 01:16:55,132
Nicole.

1363
01:16:55,175 --> 01:16:56,176
I need to talk to you.
It's important.

1364
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:57,700
Yes, but I'm in
a meeting here.

1365
01:16:57,743 --> 01:16:59,397
- It can't wait.
- It will have to.

1366
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,486
Mr. Cleamons, please.
I'm in trouble.

1367
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:08,667
Mr. Cleamons,
I don't know what to do.

1368
01:17:08,711 --> 01:17:10,234
I know what I should do,

1369
01:17:10,277 --> 01:17:11,235
but I'm afraid.

1370
01:17:11,278 --> 01:17:12,628
Afraid of what?
What's going on?

1371
01:17:12,671 --> 01:17:14,151
It's about Fast Freddy.

1372
01:17:14,194 --> 01:17:15,413
What about Fred?

1373
01:17:17,807 --> 01:17:19,765
I know who killed him.

1374
01:17:19,809 --> 01:17:21,375
I saw.

1375
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:35,738
So...

1376
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:37,087
What are you going
to do about it?

1377
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:38,436
I want you to
tell me what to do.

1378
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:39,567
No.

1379
01:17:39,611 --> 01:17:41,569
You're strong enough
and smart enough

1380
01:17:41,613 --> 01:17:43,006
to know your own conscience.

1381
01:17:43,049 --> 01:17:44,485
The responsibility is yours.

1382
01:17:44,529 --> 01:17:46,226
Yeah, you talk about
responsibility in your class,

1383
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:47,967
but this is the real world.

1384
01:17:48,011 --> 01:17:50,578
Fred Shepherd was a friend
of mine in the real world.

1385
01:17:50,622 --> 01:17:52,929
That boy who died with him
was someone you also know.

1386
01:17:52,972 --> 01:17:54,191
You owe them!

1387
01:17:54,234 --> 01:17:56,541
Yeah, but they're dead,
and I'm not!

1388
01:17:56,584 --> 01:17:58,674
And I don't know what
will happen to me if I talk!

1389
01:17:58,717 --> 01:18:01,459
Nicole, what kind of
person are you going to be?

1390
01:18:03,635 --> 01:18:04,941
Nicole.

1391
01:18:04,984 --> 01:18:06,551
Where do you
draw the line?

1392
01:18:08,771 --> 01:18:12,644
When are you going to
stop being afraid?

1393
01:18:14,211 --> 01:18:16,213
Why do you have to
ask so many questions?

1394
01:18:16,256 --> 01:18:17,910
Isn't that why
you came to me?

1395
01:18:17,954 --> 01:18:21,348
You knew I'd ask questions,
not give you answers.

1396
01:18:23,263 --> 01:18:24,700
Yeah.

1397
01:18:26,397 --> 01:18:28,051
Let me ask you a question.

1398
01:18:28,094 --> 01:18:31,271
When was the last time
you risked your life?

1399
01:18:31,315 --> 01:18:34,753
You live in this nice,
big, fucking safe house.

1400
01:18:34,797 --> 01:18:38,757
I live in Eden Gardens.
I risk my life
every time I go home,

1401
01:18:38,801 --> 01:18:41,934
which is where I'm going
right now.
Thanks for nothing!

1402
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:56,079
[cell door closing]

1403
01:18:58,516 --> 01:19:00,823
Detective Callahan, please.

1404
01:19:01,867 --> 01:19:04,652
Nicole Turner.
He told me to call.

1405
01:19:07,264 --> 01:19:09,179
Yeah, I could wait.

1406
01:19:11,834 --> 01:19:13,966
Detective Callahan?

1407
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:15,576
â™ª Going in and out

1408
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:16,882
â™ª Round and around

1409
01:19:16,926 --> 01:19:18,362
â™ª Come, come,
now second round â™ª

1410
01:19:18,405 --> 01:19:21,191
â™ª Pull the panties down

1411
01:19:21,234 --> 01:19:22,192
â™ª Down, down

1412
01:19:22,235 --> 01:19:24,847
â™ª I'm the freaky type...

1413
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:26,544
Freeze, police!

1414
01:19:26,587 --> 01:19:27,806
Taurus, drop
that gun now!

1415
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:28,807
What the fuck is
going on here?

1416
01:19:28,851 --> 01:19:30,417
Come on, nobody
has to die!

1417
01:19:30,461 --> 01:19:31,984
- Come on!
- Yo, back up!

1418
01:19:32,028 --> 01:19:33,769
Yo, put your guns down.

1419
01:19:33,812 --> 01:19:35,161
Nobody will die.

1420
01:19:35,205 --> 01:19:36,206
Put it down.

1421
01:19:36,249 --> 01:19:37,773
Nobody has
to die, bro.

1422
01:19:39,296 --> 01:19:40,297
Fuck that!

1423
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:42,255
[shouting]

1424
01:19:49,741 --> 01:19:52,222
Stop or I'll shoot!

1425
01:19:52,265 --> 01:19:53,266
[gunshots]

1426
01:19:54,311 --> 01:19:55,791
Ah!

1427
01:20:09,065 --> 01:20:10,936
Get your fucking
hands in the air!

1428
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:12,808
Don't you move, asshole!
Stay right there!

1429
01:20:12,851 --> 01:20:13,852
Get him.

1430
01:20:13,896 --> 01:20:15,767
You're under arrest.

1431
01:20:17,377 --> 01:20:18,335
[door opening]

1432
01:20:18,378 --> 01:20:19,292
Hey, buddy, buddy.

1433
01:20:19,336 --> 01:20:20,772
I just got off the phone.

1434
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,382
Everybody's on board.

1435
01:20:22,426 --> 01:20:24,471
You won!

1436
01:20:24,515 --> 01:20:26,778
The deal is going
to fly, Will.

1437
01:20:27,779 --> 01:20:29,041
Will?

1438
01:20:29,085 --> 01:20:30,260
Are you all right?

1439
01:20:31,609 --> 01:20:36,353
Joe, there's something
I've got to do.

1440
01:21:09,734 --> 01:21:11,040
You look good.

1441
01:21:12,955 --> 01:21:15,218
So why'd you come
after all these years?

1442
01:21:16,349 --> 01:21:18,525
I want you to know
I didn't send Nicole.

1443
01:21:18,569 --> 01:21:20,353
I know that.

1444
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,967
She talks about
you a lot.

1445
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:28,971
You made a big
impression on her.

1446
01:21:29,014 --> 01:21:31,582
She made an impression on me.

1447
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:33,192
An even better one.

1448
01:21:33,236 --> 01:21:36,326
So what's the real
reason you're here?

1449
01:21:36,369 --> 01:21:37,370
I just told you.

1450
01:21:37,414 --> 01:21:39,024
Don't bullshit me, Will.

1451
01:21:39,068 --> 01:21:43,333
We were together a long time.
It was never your strong suit.

1452
01:21:44,247 --> 01:21:47,032
Why do you
think I came?

1453
01:21:47,076 --> 01:21:49,208
You want to
let go of something.

1454
01:21:51,950 --> 01:21:53,299
What?

1455
01:21:53,343 --> 01:21:55,214
Pain, maybe.

1456
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:02,265
You don't know

1457
01:22:02,308 --> 01:22:06,965
how hard it was for me
to make this trip.

1458
01:22:07,009 --> 01:22:09,925
Maybe I have some idea.

1459
01:22:15,278 --> 01:22:17,584
Let me tell you,

1460
01:22:20,109 --> 01:22:23,199
maybe I could've--

1461
01:22:27,159 --> 01:22:30,641
Maybe I should've hung in
a little longer with you.

1462
01:22:30,684 --> 01:22:32,643
waiting for you,
banging on your door,

1463
01:22:32,686 --> 01:22:34,950
but you just
made it impossible.

1464
01:22:36,429 --> 01:22:38,344
Now, you won't admit it
or you can't admit it,

1465
01:22:38,388 --> 01:22:41,043
but you were never
there for me.

1466
01:22:42,348 --> 01:22:43,784
I know.

1467
01:22:43,828 --> 01:22:46,004
You know.

1468
01:22:51,879 --> 01:22:54,404
I just wanted
you there for me.

1469
01:22:57,276 --> 01:23:00,323
I remember everything
about you, Des.

1470
01:23:03,195 --> 01:23:06,068
The way your eyes sparkled.

1471
01:23:06,111 --> 01:23:12,683
The way your hair smelled.

1472
01:23:12,726 --> 01:23:14,859
You're still beautiful.

1473
01:23:16,295 --> 01:23:18,384
I'm older, Will.

1474
01:23:20,386 --> 01:23:23,041
A lot more
miles on me,

1475
01:23:23,085 --> 01:23:26,653
but I'm not
running away anymore.

1476
01:23:26,697 --> 01:23:30,135
Not trying to bury
my head in the sand.

1477
01:23:39,275 --> 01:23:41,712
It's just hard
seeing you.

1478
01:23:45,629 --> 01:23:47,587
Very hard.

1479
01:23:49,546 --> 01:23:51,939
I know.

1480
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,815
You look great, though.

1481
01:23:59,251 --> 01:24:01,688
The gray hair
makes you look, um...

1482
01:24:01,732 --> 01:24:03,560
Old.

1483
01:24:03,603 --> 01:24:05,823
Distinguished.

1484
01:24:06,867 --> 01:24:10,262
Now who's doing
the bullshitting?

1485
01:24:15,963 --> 01:24:17,530
So then what is this?

1486
01:24:19,228 --> 01:24:21,143
A trip to the past?

1487
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:25,886
Well, I don't know.

1488
01:24:29,586 --> 01:24:35,374
I certainly don't want
to run away or
hide my head in the sand.

1489
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:48,257
After you left me, Des,

1490
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:51,651
I was stuck for a long time.

1491
01:24:56,047 --> 01:25:02,967
But I'm getting it
back together now.

1492
01:25:06,144 --> 01:25:08,712
I'm a survivor, too.

1493
01:25:12,759 --> 01:25:16,241
I just wanted to see you.

1494
01:25:33,737 --> 01:25:37,044
Mr. Cleamons, what's
going to become of me?

1495
01:25:37,088 --> 01:25:38,524
I'll be okay, right?

1496
01:25:38,568 --> 01:25:40,178
Don't worry.

1497
01:25:40,222 --> 01:25:42,920
You're going to pass
the GED with flying colors

1498
01:25:42,963 --> 01:25:44,400
and then you'll
go on from there.

1499
01:25:44,443 --> 01:25:47,142
Oh, by the way, I've been
meaning to give you this.

1500
01:25:47,185 --> 01:25:49,318
It's from Spelling College
in Atlanta.

1501
01:25:49,361 --> 01:25:51,711
And if you pass the test
and apply,

1502
01:25:51,755 --> 01:25:54,236
I think you'll be in line
for a scholarship.

1503
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,542
Me?

1504
01:25:56,586 --> 01:25:57,804
[laughs]

1505
01:25:57,848 --> 01:25:59,241
Go to Atlanta?

1506
01:25:59,284 --> 01:26:01,939
Mr. Cleamons, your house is
about as far from Brooklyn

1507
01:26:01,982 --> 01:26:03,158
as I've ever been.

1508
01:26:03,201 --> 01:26:05,595
Well, you'll go
a lot farther, Nicole.

1509
01:26:05,638 --> 01:26:08,032
As long as you come back.
We need you here.

1510
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:12,732
[no audible dialogue]

1511
01:26:25,267 --> 01:26:26,659
[laughing]

1512
01:26:48,115 --> 01:26:51,423
â™ª [techno]

1513
01:26:53,295 --> 01:26:55,340
[cheering]

1514
01:27:04,044 --> 01:27:05,220
[laughing]

1515
01:27:07,309 --> 01:27:08,658
What's so funny?

1516
01:27:08,701 --> 01:27:09,789
Nothing.

1517
01:27:09,833 --> 01:27:15,099
Just...my baby girl
done grown up.

1518
01:27:15,142 --> 01:27:19,364
Yeah, well, I won't feel
grown up 'til I'm out of here.

1519
01:27:19,408 --> 01:27:21,627
Going to Atlanta, you know.

1520
01:27:21,671 --> 01:27:23,455
I know.

1521
01:27:27,677 --> 01:27:29,635
You know, Ruthie?

1522
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:30,854
Hmm?

1523
01:27:32,725 --> 01:27:34,466
I'm not running away from you.

1524
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:35,554
I know.

1525
01:27:35,598 --> 01:27:37,600
You just want
to get away.

1526
01:27:37,643 --> 01:27:40,516
I understand what
that's about, believe me.

1527
01:27:43,345 --> 01:27:46,478
And I am so proud of you.

1528
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:52,005
[laughing]

1529
01:27:52,049 --> 01:27:53,746
I'm proud of you, too, Mom.

1530
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:55,357
Thank you, baby.

1531
01:28:00,666 --> 01:28:02,233
[tires screeching]

1532
01:28:07,151 --> 01:28:08,935
Hey, Nicole.
What's happening?

1533
01:28:08,979 --> 01:28:10,720
'Cause our boy just
got picked up,

1534
01:28:10,763 --> 01:28:13,549
and we were just
wondering if you had
anything to do with it.

1535
01:28:15,551 --> 01:28:17,117
Who's your boy?

1536
01:28:19,816 --> 01:28:21,774
'Aight.

1537
01:28:24,342 --> 01:28:26,213
Miss Turner, where
were you at 10 P.M.

1538
01:28:26,257 --> 01:28:29,434
on the evening of
September 27th, 1996?

1539
01:28:29,478 --> 01:28:31,436
I was working at
Fast Freddy's.

1540
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:34,004
It's a hamburger joint
on Fulton Street.

1541
01:28:34,047 --> 01:28:36,398
And what, if anything,
happened at that time?

1542
01:28:36,441 --> 01:28:40,010
I was working behind
the counter, cleaning up,

1543
01:28:40,053 --> 01:28:42,578
and this man came in
and he was carrying a gun.

1544
01:28:42,621 --> 01:28:45,929
He robbed us and he shot
and killed Freddy and Gary.

1545
01:28:47,191 --> 01:28:50,629
Do you see the person who fired
the gun in this courtroom today?

1546
01:28:57,332 --> 01:29:00,030
Yes, I do.

1547
01:29:00,073 --> 01:29:01,466
He's sitting right over there.

1548
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:05,122
Let the record reflect
that Miss Turner

1549
01:29:05,165 --> 01:29:08,081
has indicated the defendant,
Taurus McKnight.

1550
01:29:37,763 --> 01:29:39,330
Everything.

1551
01:29:48,861 --> 01:29:50,472
I thought I'd
find you here.

1552
01:29:54,519 --> 01:29:56,260
I'm going to
miss this room.

1553
01:29:56,303 --> 01:29:58,610
Seems so empty with
all the photos gone.

1554
01:29:58,654 --> 01:30:00,743
It's funny.

1555
01:30:00,786 --> 01:30:03,136
I almost feel like I lost
my sense of purpose

1556
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:05,182
since I took
the last one down.

1557
01:30:05,225 --> 01:30:07,140
There's one more left.

1558
01:30:07,184 --> 01:30:09,360
I've been saving
for this moment.

1559
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,362
Where?

1560
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,943
Her name is Nicole Turner.

1561
01:30:28,248 --> 01:30:32,209
And I'm proud to have her
up on my wall.

1562
01:30:47,267 --> 01:30:49,269
â™ª Even though you never
treat me right â™ª

1563
01:30:49,313 --> 01:30:50,488
â™ª Still I want to spend half

1564
01:30:50,532 --> 01:30:52,229
There, there, there!
You feel it?

1565
01:30:52,272 --> 01:30:53,839
Yes!

1566
01:30:53,883 --> 01:30:56,146
Oh, my God,
you gotta do this!

1567
01:30:56,189 --> 01:30:58,148
Ooh, this is
a strong kid.

1568
01:30:58,191 --> 01:31:00,324
[laughing]

1569
01:31:01,412 --> 01:31:02,718
Ooh.

1570
01:31:02,761 --> 01:31:06,199
I'm gonna miss
hanging out with you guys.

1571
01:31:06,243 --> 01:31:07,200
[laughing]

1572
01:31:11,161 --> 01:31:13,206
Yo, why y'all keep
acting like this is it?

1573
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:15,208
How come all of a sudden
everybody but me

1574
01:31:15,252 --> 01:31:18,081
got places to go
and things to do?

1575
01:31:18,124 --> 01:31:20,562
I've been thinking about
going back to school and shit.

1576
01:31:20,605 --> 01:31:22,302
You know, getting my diploma.

1577
01:31:22,346 --> 01:31:24,087
Why the fuck not?

1578
01:31:24,130 --> 01:31:25,523
You're serious?

1579
01:31:25,567 --> 01:31:26,872
Dead-ass serious.

1580
01:31:26,916 --> 01:31:29,179
Crystal's gonna get her
some education.

1581
01:31:29,222 --> 01:31:30,223
Shut up.

1582
01:31:30,267 --> 01:31:32,791
Right.

1583
01:31:45,151 --> 01:31:46,109
Hi, Lewis.

1584
01:31:46,152 --> 01:31:48,154
You look different, baby.

1585
01:31:48,198 --> 01:31:49,329
Yeah?

1586
01:31:51,593 --> 01:31:53,595
Yo, I heard.

1587
01:31:53,638 --> 01:31:54,726
What?

1588
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:56,772
You know,
that you going.

1589
01:31:56,815 --> 01:31:58,295
That you got
some place to go.

1590
01:31:58,338 --> 01:32:00,819
I'm glad for you.

1591
01:32:00,863 --> 01:32:02,299
You deserve it.

1592
01:32:02,342 --> 01:32:04,344
You're about to
get up out of here.

1593
01:32:06,042 --> 01:32:07,696
You just can't
let them stop you.

1594
01:32:09,306 --> 01:32:12,178
Thanks.

1595
01:32:12,222 --> 01:32:14,224
I'll talk to you.

1596
01:32:16,356 --> 01:32:18,271
I'm here.

1597
01:32:18,315 --> 01:32:20,404
Bye.

1598
01:32:20,447 --> 01:32:21,536
Nicky.

1599
01:32:23,102 --> 01:32:24,103
I'll see you.

1600
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:29,892
Have a nice
trip, Nicky.

1601
01:32:29,935 --> 01:32:31,110
All right.

1602
01:32:31,154 --> 01:32:34,157
Oh, sweetie, take care
of yourself, you hear?

1603
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:38,248
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

1604
01:32:38,291 --> 01:32:41,251
So much.

1605
01:32:41,294 --> 01:32:42,905
All right.

1606
01:32:42,948 --> 01:32:44,515
Take care.
Bye.

1607
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:46,299
Nicky:
Bye.

1608
01:32:48,650 --> 01:32:50,565
Bye.

1609
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:58,747
Thank you.

1610
01:32:58,790 --> 01:33:00,183
Thank yourself.

1611
01:33:00,226 --> 01:33:02,751
You made the choices
that brought you to this day.

1612
01:33:04,753 --> 01:33:06,232
I'm gonna come back,
Mr. Cleamons.

1613
01:33:06,276 --> 01:33:07,973
I said I would,
and I will.

1614
01:33:10,367 --> 01:33:11,586
For you.

1615
01:33:11,629 --> 01:33:12,848
Your $10 fees.

1616
01:33:12,891 --> 01:33:14,589
For a rainy day.

1617
01:33:14,632 --> 01:33:16,460
I saved them for you.

1618
01:33:16,503 --> 01:33:19,332
It's the best investment
I ever made.

1619
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:30,213
I love you, Mr. Cleamons.

1620
01:33:33,303 --> 01:33:36,654
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Get on that plane.
 Just go get on the plane.

1621
01:33:40,092 --> 01:33:41,877
Your bag.

1622
01:33:43,139 --> 01:33:45,184
It's okay.
Thank you.

1623
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:11,602
Dr. Martin Luther King:
For some strange reason,
I can never be

1624
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:14,474
what I ought to be until
you are what you ought to be.

1625
01:34:14,518 --> 01:34:17,390
The rich man can never be
what he ought to be

1626
01:34:17,434 --> 01:34:21,090
until the poor man
is what he ought to be.

1627
01:34:21,133 --> 01:34:24,615
John Donne caught it years ago
and placed it in graphic terms:

1628
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:27,096
"No man is an island
entire of itself.

1629
01:34:27,139 --> 01:34:28,880
"Every man is a piece
of the continent,

1630
01:34:28,924 --> 01:34:32,231
a part of the main,"
and then he goes on
toward the end to say,

1631
01:34:32,275 --> 01:34:34,886
"any man's death
diminishes me,

1632
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:38,063
"because I am involved
in mankind,

1633
01:34:38,107 --> 01:34:42,720
"and therefore never send to
know for whom the bell tolls,

1634
01:34:42,764 --> 01:34:46,463
it tolls for thee."

1635
01:37:49,124 --> 01:37:52,910
[laughing]

1636
01:37:52,954 --> 01:37:54,956
She says--

1637
01:37:54,999 --> 01:37:56,435
Oh, well.
