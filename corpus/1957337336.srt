has a real kick to it.

Did you do something
different tonight?

190
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,422
- Take a sip of water, Norm.
- Oh.

191
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,265
Ahh.

192
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,143

what you're talking about.

194
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,065
You didn't spice it up
a little bit?

195
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,400
It's just a little cumin.

196
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,403
No more than the recipe
calls for.

197
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,780
Mom, what's cumin again?

198
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,365
Honey, let's not do this tonight.

199
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,534
Just eat your salad, please.

200
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,329
- Hey, um... shells are edible.
- Mm.

201
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,290
Anybody tried their shell yet?

202
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,836
And why are you not eating?

203
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:23,673
- Something happen at school?
- Mom, why are you doing this?

204
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,800
Why are you trying to pry, OK?

205
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,260
It's, like, pry, pry, pry with you.

206
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:30,638
No one's prying, Kev. Your mom
just asked you a question.

207
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,889
You need to take it down
a notch.

208

- Patty, cool it.

210
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,940
- So, how was school today?
- Oh, my God.

211
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,775
Is it always gonna be
an inquisition?

212
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,277

Hmm?

You better tame that tone, mister.

214
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,488
I'm done.
May I be excused, please?

215
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,699
No, you may not.
You're gonna sit there with all of us,

216
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,617
eat your taco salad
and have dessert.

217
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,162
- I got a chocolate cake.
- (Chuckles)

218
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,665
Hey, Mom, can I go see a rock show
with Sissy and Karen on Friday?

219
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,126
Sissy and Karen?
That's a blast from the past.

220
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,586
I haven't heard you
talk about them

221
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:02,920
since you dropped out
of junior college.

222
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,505
What's the group?

223
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,549
Oh, they're this really cool
group from New York City.

224
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,427
They're, um...
really smart and stuff.

225
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,804
The music is almost educational.

226
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,431
What's the name of the group?

227
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,183
The Alliance.

228
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,934
Oh, I don't know.

229
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,229
That-that sounds pretty militant.
The Alliance?

230
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,107
I don't like the sound
of this New York militia music.

231
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,443
Come on, I never get
to do anything fun!

232
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,070
- (Fork clatters)
- Hey, you need to take it down a notch.

233
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,238
Shut the hell up, Kev!

234
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,825
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Watch the language.

235
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:38,080
All right?
Now, rock concerts are bad news.

236
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,666
Plus, we don't want you around
all those strobe lights.

237
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,792
That's true.

238
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,878
There's not gonna be
any strobe lights.

239
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,130
Hey, here's an idea.

240
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,883
Why don't you invite Sissy
and Karen over Friday night

241
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:49,967
and have a slumber party
like old times.

242
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,552
We can play Party Farm.

243
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,845
Dad can whip up
some homemade ice cream.

244
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,180
Hm-hm.

245
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,933

that baby stuff anymore, Mom.

00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,802
Mr. Hanley just let me go.

358
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,263
What, like you got fired?

359
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,432
Well, Michigan's raising
the minimum wage,

360
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,352
so he's gonna go back to cleaning
the animal cages himself

361
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,187
until the economy
gets back on its feet.

362
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,398
Jesus Christ, that's what
he fuckin' told you?

363
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:52,069
Uh-huh.

364
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:55,697
So, I'm guessing that's not
chocolate chip on your smock.

365
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,540
You're funny.

366
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:11,630
Look, you got someplace
around here we can go?

367
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,177
Mm.

368
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,312
(Door clicking)

369
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,488
(Sighs)

370
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,657
(Lighter flicks)

371
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:42,286
You can't smoke in here.
My dad's allergic.

372
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,496
- (Inhales)
- Fuck your dad.

373
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,594
Is that your mom?

374
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,471
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

375
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,057
What, is she a bull dyke?

376
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:07,686
- What do you mean?
- I mean, does she eat pussy?

377
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,439
You see, the haircut
gives it away.

378
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:14,401
It makes her look like
a real pro muff-diver.

379
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,446
(Inhales)

380
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,198
Is that your brother?

381
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:22,034
- Yeah, that's Kevin.
- Oh.

382
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,536
He looks like a faggot.

383
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,205
Well, he's not homosexual.

384
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,916
Yeah, I'm sure
he just looks queer.

385
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,422
You the oldest?

386
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,508
Yeah.

387
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,177
Kevin's adopted.

388
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:41,303
No shit?

389
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:43,764
Imagine that.

390
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,892
The old barren bull dyke
adopting a little fag kid

391
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:51,021
just doing her part
for society and shit.

392
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,984
Come on.

393
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,864
(♪ Electronic music)

394
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,077
You want something to drink?

395
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,664
Sure, what do you got?

396
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:12,834
Water, ice tea,
cherry juice box...

397
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,088
That's a pretty
weak-ass selection.

398
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:20,676
- How 'bout a couple of beers?
- Sorry, Dad's allergic.

399
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,428
To cigarette smoke
and alcohol?

400
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,013
Yeah.

401
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,684
Jesus fuckin' Christ.
How does he cope?

402
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,769
What do you mean?

403
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,605
I mean, how does he cope
in this loser fuckin' family

404
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,066
without some kind of vice?

405
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,406
What's a vice again?

406
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,827
You know,
I can't figure you out.

407
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:53,542
You got shit for brains
and zero personality,

408
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:57,379
but you lose those glasses
and that shit-peppered smock,

409
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,589
hell, I could probably
get hard.

410
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:07,973
You know I'm fuckin'
with you, right?

411
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,894
(Slurps)

412
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,440
Take off your glasses.

413
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,950
Let your hair down.

414
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,791
Shake it out.

415
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,673
Now take off
that stupid fuckin' smock.

416
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,153
Why did you bring me
to your house?

417
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,656
I don't know.

418
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:07,783
Bullshit.

419
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:14,581
I think you know exactly
why you brought me here.

420
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,253
You got a boyfriend?

421
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,005
No.

422
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,007
Girlfriend?

423
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,592
No.

424
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,928
I don't give a shit if you
suck pussy like your mom.

425
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,097
I got a thing for dyke bitches.

426
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,932
No, I'm not homosexual.

427
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:35,060
(Chuckles)

428
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:38,271
You know I'm still
fuckin' with you, right?

429
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,776
(Chuckles)

430
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,904
You need
to take it down a notch.

431
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,118
What is that supposed to mean?

432
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,412
(Chuckles)

433
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:02,879
Look, I owe you one.

434
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,967
You name it.

435
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,137
Deal?

436
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,980
Think about it.

437
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,566
(Door opens)

438
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,901
- (Connie) Patty?
- That's my mom.

439
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,697
I could use your help
with the grocery bags, please.

440
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,034
Oh, my.

441
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,495
(Coughing)

442
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,665
Mm.

443
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,126
That is fuckin' delicious, Connie.
Thank you.

444
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,419
- I was half starved.
- Dad, he just...

445
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,129
You're gonna let him get away
with that F-bomb?

446
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:45,964
(Sneezes)

447
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,758
- Quiet, Kev.
- Yeah. Quiet, Kev.

448
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:52,888
- Shut up, retard.
- That's enough, Kevin.

449
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,390
- What do you call this again?
- Chicken cordon bleu.

450
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,808
It's fantastic.

451
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,812
Well, it was frozen.
It's not like she made it herself, so...

452
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,398
Tame that tone, Kev.
You're on thin ice!

453
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:07,402
Kevin, you're at an eight,
and you need to be at about a three.

454
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,237
I'm sorry.
He's usually not so aggressive.

455
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,572
It's fine. It's fine.

456
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:14,159
I'm just not used
to cooking of this caliber.

457
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:17,871
You see, in Africa
our rations are very meager.

458
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,457
- Africa?
- My parents are missionaries.

459
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:24,461
We've, uh... spent the last three years
building churches in Tanzania.

460
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,962
Oh, my.

461
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:31,009
If you survived on a diet of ugali
and, uh, sweet potatoes for three years,

462
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:35,222
you'd understand why I'm so ecstatic
about your mom's cordon bleu.

463
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,140
- What's ugali?
- Don't worry about it.

464
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,475
(Sneezes)

465
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,311
- So what's with the haircut?
- Stop prying.

466
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,437
Stop frothing.

467
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,523
Another word and you both
can forget about dessert.

468
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,274
You know, there's no dessert
in Tanzania.

469
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,279
You know, I've always dreamed
of doing missionary work.

470
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:56,826
Uh... seeing the world
or really making a difference.

471
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:59,454
Well, you know, nothing's,
uh... nothing's stopping you

472
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,957
from enlisting
on Team Jesus, Norm.

473
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:05,752
In fact, I'm rounding up a fresh batch
of apostles as we speak.

474
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:07,629
Oh, well, uh, uh...
(Chuckling)

475
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:11,216
I was thinking more down the line,
you know, after I retire.

476
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,678
It's good to have a purpose.

477
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:18,390
But if there's any
other way we can help...

478
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:22,310
Actually, um... I'm in need
of a host family for the week.

479
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,104
I beg your pardon?

480
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,106
He's looking
for somewhere to stay, Norm.

481
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,440
Oh!

482
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,402
You see, when we moved to Tanzania,
my parents, they sold the house.

483
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,988
They donated the money
to the church.

484
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:36,408
Our, uh... regular
host family's out of town,

485
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:39,411
so I've been sleeping
on the couch in the church

486
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:40,537
for the past two nights.

487
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:43,331
He can stay in Kevin's room
on the top bunk.

488
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,666
No frickin' way!

489
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,711
Take it down a notch, Kev.

490
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,297
- What do you think?
- (Sneezes)

491
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:54,009
Yeah, I have no problem with it.
I'm happy to help.

492
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,427
- (Sniffs)
- (Fork clatters)

493
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,429
This blows!
Don't get a say?

494
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,848
What's with all the hostility, rager?

495
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,308
I'm not "raging".

496
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,226
I just don't want to bunk
with some creep

497
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,520
- with a half-shaved head, OK?
- That's it. You're grounded.

498
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,355
- Grounded?
- Grounded with no pudding.

499
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,942
Connie, it's fine, really.

500
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,028
- I know what's wrong with Kev.
- You do?

501
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,739
Sure. It's obvious.

502
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,408
Hey, new guy, do me a favor,
don't call me Kev.

503
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,076
You've been here, like,
five minutes.

504
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,912
Zip it, mister, right now.

505
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,540
Look, I don't mean
to be forward, but, um...

506
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,877
I noticed that there wasn't any
family prayer prior to the meal.

507
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,253
Is that common?

508
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,423
Well, yeah, I guess.

509
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,468
OK, well, would you mind
if I, uh...

510
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:40,930
led us in a, a prayer
just a, just a simple...

511
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,599
Uh, of course not.
Thank you.

512
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,893
- We'd be honored.
- (Norm) Sure. Great.

513
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,854
All right, everybody, grab hands.

514
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,940
Grab hands, OK?

515
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,654
- Kevin.
- (Sighs)

516
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:04,913
Dear Lord, we thank you for this bountiful
and nourishing meal on the table before us.

517
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,875
May it strengthen and refresh
our earth bodies

518
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,879
so that we may follow your
example for yet another day.

519
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,965
Please bless Connie,
who has prepared this feast

520
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:19,219
with loving hands,
as well as her life partner,

521
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:22,722
Norman, who invites you
into his heart

522
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,600
and hopes to one day
be called to Tanzania

523
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,645
where he can make a difference.

524
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,148
And please bless Patty,
whose kindness and hospitality

525
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,067
has allowed me
into this home

526
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:39,030
where I can spread your
wisdom amongst these souls.

527
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,659
And please, bless
and watch over Kevin,

528
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,411
who especially needs
your guidance

529
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,038
during his rebellious years,

530
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:50,291
as he continues to lash out
and alienate himself

531
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:53,628
from those around him.

532
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:58,466
Allow him to grow in grace
and knowledge of you,

533
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:03,555
and guide him in his search
for his birth parents,

534
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,933
who must one day hope
to see his face,

535
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:12,272
just as he longs
to see theirs.

536
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,650
- Wait, what?
- In Jesus' name, we pray.

537
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,610
- Mom?
- Uh...

538
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,696
Amen.

539
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,366
(Distant yelling)

540
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,119
Sorry my room is a pig sty.

541
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:30,582
Your family gives me
a fuckin' migraine.

542
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,751
I've never seen Kev
break down like that.

543
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:33,918
I feel bad for him.

544
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,587
Look, it's about time somebody
got straight with him.

545
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:36,713
I mean, Jesus Christ.

546
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,423
When were they gonna fuckin' tell him,
on their death beds?

547
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,802
(Chuckles)

548
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,928
You want a zinger?

549
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,764
No, thanks.
I've got my own.

550
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,057
- Oh?
- Mm-hm.

551
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,478
I'm on five different medications.

552
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:55,732
Jesus fucking Christ.

553
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,776
You want to listen
to some records?

554
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,821
Knock yourself out.

555
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,990
Thanks for including me
in your prayer.

556
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,241
I thought that was sweet.

557
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,911
You actually bought that shit?

558
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,037
Bought what?

559
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,082
That church bullshit?

560
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,169
You mean you told a lie?

561
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,087
Yeah.

562
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,341
Why would you lie
about Tanzania?

563
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:22,550
Fuck Tanzania.

564
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,595
Look, I needed a place
to hole up.

565
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,806
- Your house is perfect.
- Why is it perfect?

566
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,851
Because nobody'll look
for me here.

567
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,103
- Like those policemen?
- Yeah.

568
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,105
Well, why were they
looking for you?

569
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,274
Because I like to burn shit.

570
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,235
(Lighter clinks)

571
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:45,323
You wouldn't burn
our house down, would you?

572
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,449
No. Fuck that.

573
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,701
Come on, I wouldn't pull
any weak shit like that.

574
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,203
(Exhales)

575
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:57,001
Hey, remember when you said
that you owed me one?

576
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,754
Yeah, cos it was,
like, an hour ago.

577
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,257
Well, I know what I want.

578
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:03,424
All right, hit me.

579
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:08,054
I want you to take me
to The Alliance concert on Friday night.

580
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,306
You would.

581
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,226
Bunch of fuckin' posers.

582
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,312
Yeah, but PSYOPS is opening for them,
and they're my favorite band.

583
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:20,567
There is no fucking way
PSYOPS would play a show

584
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:21,776
with a band like The Alliance.

585
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,027
(Chuckles)

586
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,405
No, it's true!

587
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,244
Some kid was handing out flyers
downtown a few days ago.

588
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,788
What the fuck is this?

589
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,334
How the fuck did you know
about PSYOPS?

590

(♪ Punk rock music playing)

591
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:42,005
Well, my friends Sissy and Karen
turned me onto them.

592
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,173
I've got all their seven inches,
all their cassettes.

593
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,508
- Every one.
- No, you don't.

594
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,759
Look!

595
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,347
I even had to make a dub
of "Dinner In America"

596
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,558
because my Boombox
chewed up the original.

602

Knock it off.

603
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,990
Knock it off.
You're getting yourself all worked up.

604
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,409
You know, John Q. wears a ski mask
when they play.

605
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,869
Yeah, everybody fuckin' knows that.

606
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,830

It's so cool.
It's like, it's top secret.

608
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,378
- You wanna know my secret?
- No.

609
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,671
Oh, come on.
It's a good one.

610

613
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,890
Well, they're more like poems.
Love poems.

Are you doing a number two?

Because, um... if you need
some extra toilet tissues,

You're always about

I'm serious! You order something
or take a fuckin' hike!

Does this look
like a men's shelter?

635
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:43,519
You order something
off the dinner menu!

636

Jesus fucking Christ, Lou!
Just get the coffee!

- I don't wanna fuckin' talk about it.

645

You junkie fuck!
You spent it all on dope, huh?

646
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,884
You better reel him the fuck in.

647
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,844

You're a load of shit, Morgan!

649
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,598
In the last four months,
you've kicked in, what, 50 bucks

650
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,100
and that piece of shit PA head?

651
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:23,601
Fuck you!
That PA is 300 watts.

Fuck you!
Fuck your 300 watts, OK?

Fuck all of you!

654
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,607
I'm the one floating
this whole operation.

655
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,609
Do you know how much blood
I need to give

656
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,361
to the fuckin' vampires
at the lab

657
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,947
just to get our masters
out of this hostage situation?

658
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,448
Yeah. Everyone just calm
the fuck down.

659
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,534
- No. Why don't you calm the fuck down?
- Yeah?

660
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,369
We still gotta do the jackets,
press the fuckin' vinyl.

661
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:42,745
That's another three grand.

662
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,999
Look, Eddie Sorvino
called me last week, OK?

663
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,336
Monty played him the Majestic Twelve
session, and he fucking flipped.

664
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,381
- That's how this whole thing started.
- Shut the fuck up, Morgan!

665
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:56,342
He wants us to play this gig
with The Alliance, OK?

666
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,594
See if we're a good fit,
feel us out.

667
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,681
If the band likes us,
we're in for the last leg of the tour.

668
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,182
"If the band likes us?"

669
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:07,186
Plus he said he'd cover our dupes
and get us square with Monty.

670
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,189
Sorvino knows we're good.
He thinks we can go places.

671
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,442
Go places?
We're not fuckin' sailors.

672
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:14,777
We're a punk rock band.

673
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,530
Hey, asshole! This could be
our big fucking break, OK?

674
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:21,450
Our big break? What the fuck
are you talking about?

675
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,622
Look, you guys
want to play puppet show

676
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,083
on Eddie Sorvino's
little circus tour,

677
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,503
go right ahead, but leave me
the fuck out of it.

678
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,630
- How about we vote on it?
- It's not a democracy.

679
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:36,924
I vote we play
the fucking show.

680
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,843
Me too.

681
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:41,304
What about you, Donovan?

682
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:44,932
Yeah, Donnie.
What about you?

683
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,562
Fucking Christ,
I thought we went over this?

684
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,484
- What's with you?
- Quaaludes.

You don't want to play
to a sea of cellphones, do ya?

688
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:08,623
Bunch of pussies
doing the stand and stare.

689
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:13,211
That's not what music is, is it?

690
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:14,837
No.

691
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,381
Goddamn it, lady!

692
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:20,760
Go back to your shrimp basket,
mind your own fuckin' business!

693
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:23,137
That's it!
All you punks out!

694
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,514
Now! Move!

695
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:32,230
Take the scarecrow with ya.

696
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:35,650
So why the fuck did you guys cancel
the secret show on Friday?

697
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:37,485
Cos we want to save your juice
for The Alliance gig.

698
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,321
Stop talking about it
like it's fuckin' happenin'.

699
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,156
It's making me nauseous.

700
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:46,244
You assholes get the show back on
or we're fuckin' done!

701
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:48,037
I'll call you Friday at noon.

702
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,957
Yo, the heat came
by the lockout again.

703
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:53,167
They got a real hard-on
for you, man.

704
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,962
Yeah? And what the fuck
did you tell them, Morgan?

705
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,839
Same old, same old,
that we only know you as John Q.

706
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:03,094
We said you quit,
but I don't think they bought it.

707
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:05,471
You're in some deep shit, Simon.

708
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,058
Check this out.

709
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:12,144
They upped the reward.

710
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,774
(Chuckles) 5,000 bucks? Damn!

711
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,944
They said you assaulted some lady.
Tried to burn her house down?

712
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:22,780
That's fuckin' bullshit.

713
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,199
They've been using this crummy
sketch for two years.

714
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,701
At least they don't have
your real name.

715
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:29,120
Yeah, except now
they're on to me.

716
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:30,288
How do you know?

717
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:31,706
Because there was
an unmarked squad car

718
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:35,042
outside one of my crash pads,
that's how I know,

719
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,211
which means
somebody fucking narced.

720
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,297
- Don't look at me!
- I am lookin' at you.

721
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:41,048
Hey, hey. Cool it, man.
He didn't say shit!

722
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,800
Man, how the fuck do you know?

723
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,553
I don't fuckin' trust
anybody right now!

724
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,555
Come on.
Don't be paranoid.

725
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,433
- You need a new place to crash?
- Not with you assholes.

726
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:51,892
You want the keys
to the van then?

727
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,227
No. I'm set.

728
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:55,813
You're sure?

729
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:59,442
Man, you wouldn't believe me
even if I told you.

730
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:03,279
(♪ Electronic music)

731
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,519

732
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:04,632
(Screaming)

733
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:08,969
(Grunts)

734
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:11,430
Fucking cool it, rager!

735
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,266
- Fuck!
- You ruined everything!

736
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,685
Calm down or I'm gonna
fuckin' pop you!

737
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:17,812
Get off me!

738
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:19,271
You wasted my fucking tall boy.

739
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:22,233
I hate you!

740
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:23,734
You know, you've got it
pretty fuckin' good here

741
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,695
for an adopted kid, so you
better quit your bitchin'.

742
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,115
Look at that bunkbed.
It's fuckin' tits.

743
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,534
You got a keyboard.
And what the fuck are those?

744
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,953
- Hmm? Gerbils?
- Guinea pigs, asshole!

745
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,037
Whatever.

746
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,706
You know, your fuckin' problem
isn't that you're adopted,

747
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,959
it's that you're uptight.

748
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:43,754
I mean, fuck, kid, what, do you
need some weed or somethin'?

749
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,006
(Grunts)

750
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:47,883
You mean marijuana?

751
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,760

752
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,606
(Coughing continues)

753
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,233
You all right?

754
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,028
(Laughs)

755
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,780
How am I supposed to know
when that kicks in?

756
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,659
Let me see those globes.

757
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:17,079
Oh, yeah.
You're fuckin' pie-eyed, buddy.

758
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:20,040
- Huh?
- You're baked.

759
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,545
- Right now?
- Yeah.

760
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,882
- You know how I can tell?
- How?

761
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:31,427
I'm not sensing any hostility
comin' offa you.

762
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,723
- That's weird. Right?
- Hm-hm.

763
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:41,103
Look, do you want a little advice?

764
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,521
Sure.

765
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:47,151
You should be smokin' a gram
of that shit every day.

766
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,530
- Won't I get hooked?
- Hopefully.

767
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,240
(Laughs)

768
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:59,747
Look, I'mma set you up
with a quarter,

769
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:02,917
and then I'm gonna teach ya how
to roll a nice, tight bomber.

770
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,587
Aw, thanks.

771
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:12,551
Hey, did you turn the crickets up?

772
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,261
(Chuckles)

773
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,973
Don't worry about the crickets.

774
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:20,935
Yeah, you know,
I think I'm stoned.

775
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,521
Yeah, you're really
fuckin' stoned.

776
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:27,399
That shit burned out a minute ago
and you're still taking hits off of it.

777
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,791
(Footsteps approaching)

778
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,636
Hey.

779
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,680
Hey.

780
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,267
Where is everybody?

781
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,854
Dad's at the office,
Mom took Kevin to high school.

782
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:08,983
Hm.

783
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:10,609
(Inhales)

784
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,237
You got any coffee left?

785
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:17,491
It's cold.

786
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,742
I'm not supposed to have
anything turned on

787
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,286
when I'm alone at the house.

788
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,165
What are you doin'?

789
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,169
I am looking for my purpose.

790
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,130
Your purpose?

791
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:37,094
Mom says I need to find my purpose
now that I lost my job at The Pet Zone.

792
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:40,097
Look, she circled
all the good ones.

793
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,265
Let me see that.

794
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,602
Dishwasher?

795
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:48,272
That's a shit job.

796
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:51,025
Yeah, that's what I said,
but then Dad said that maybe

797
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,693
I could work my way up
to the prep table.

798
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,361
Oh, my God.

799
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:58,157
That's so fuckin' bleak,
it's makin' me lightheaded.

800
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:03,329
Table washer at the food court
in the mall?

801
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,377
God, that coffee taste like shit.

802
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,921
(Sighs)

803
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,465
It's Sanka.

804
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,178
(Mug shatters)

805
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:22,389
- You got any scratch?
- Huh?

806
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,515
(Lighter flicks)

807
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:26,310
- Money?
- (Scoffs) Nope.

808
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:30,564
Mr. Hanley still owes me
for two weeks.

809
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:35,319
That motherfucker never cut you
a check after he fired you?

810
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:38,864
- Mm-mm.
- (Lighter clinks)

811
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,284
Well, we're gonna pay him
a little visit today.

812
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:45,663
And then afterwards,
I'm gonna let you buy me lunch.

813
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,459
Hey, can we shoot hoops first?

814

Dang!

817
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,596
You're good at basketball!

818
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:10,646
What do you say
we play H-O-R-S-E?

819
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:13,107
What do you say
we play F-U-C-K instead?

820
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:19,113
You ever played F-U-C-K before?

821
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:27,579
Here's my spot, OK?

822
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,880
How come you clam up
whenever I talk about fuckin'?

823
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,555
You ever make it with a guy?

825
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,740
Woohoo!

826
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,452
Your turn.

827
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,624
All right, how 'bout this?

828
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:17,087
If I make this shot,
then you give me a kiss.

829
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:21,925

830
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,387
OK.

831
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,557
Yeah?

832
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:31,602
Yeah.

Hey, you got a dead cat here.

836
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:56,001
Yeah. It's been there
since Monday.

837
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,462
So why the fuck don't you
bury it or something?

838
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,964
I don't know. I've just been,
like, watching it.

- Why?
- I don't know.

840

That's some creepy shit.

841
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,264
- It is?
- Yeah.

00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,099
That's like serial killer shit.

843
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:13,227
- It is?
- Yeah.

844

00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,109
Oh, yeah.
No, you're fuckin' weird.

- In your case, no.

So how much
does this hand job owe you?

853

Like, 400 bucks.

854
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:51,014
What if I told you
I could double that in a day?

855

- How?
- Magic.

- I'm gonna run.
- No.

864

They'll catch you.
Cops are fast.

865
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:43,108
They parked on the other side
of the street.

866
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,359
What are they doin'?

867
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,695
Looks like
they're eating burritos.

868

Hey, fuckpie.
You here for the deuce?

00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:08,884
No, he's my boyfriend.

875
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,053
That so?

876
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:12,804
I'm not her boyfriend.

877
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,056
(Laughing)

878
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:17,559
- Retard's got a boyfriend.
- Apparently, this faggot here.

879
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,561
Shut the fuck up.

880
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,855
Don't call her a retard.

881
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,023
Can you believe this faggot?

882
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,483
Yeah, he's got a faggot mouth
on him, too.

883
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,818
That's an awful lot of faggot
talk comin' from two guys

884
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,654
that look like they're made
for a Russian circle jerk.

885
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,322
Oh, you're dissing
our tracksuits, faggot?

886
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:34,785
Yeah. I'm dissing
your motherfuckin' tracksuits.

887
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,829
- (Bell rings)
- (Automated voice) 'Stop requested.'

888
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:39,915
(Grunting)

889
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:44,086
That's what I thought, bitch.

890
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:47,339
All you punk faggots got a lot of lip,
but you can't back it up.

891
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,508
Hey, come on, D.
We're gonna be late for practice.

892
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,134
(Hocking)

893
00:57:56,056 --> 00:58:01,186
I hope he's got a decent cock, retard,
cos he can't fight for shit.

894
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,563
We're still free after practice
if you wanna fuck.

895
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,941
(Bus door closes)

896
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:21,665
(♪ Electronic music)

897
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:25,419
Where are we going?

898
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:29,464
Slow down!
My legs aren't as long as yours.

899
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,094
(Door chime rings)

900
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,263
I'll give you
everything in my pocket

901
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:37,973
if you let me borrow
your truck for an hour.

902
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:39,683
Far out, man.

903
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,395
Shit, keep her all weekend.

904
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,564
Toss me that mini bat, too.

905
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:47,941
(Engine revs)

906
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,067
(Tires screeching)

907
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,903
Buckle up!
I drive fuckin' nuts!

908
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:55,490
- It feels like we're on TV!
- This ain't fuckin' TV!

909
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,451
(Tires screeching)

910
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:02,122
Why are we at my house?

911
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:06,084
Get your Polaroid, a trash bag
and meet me out back.

912
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,880
(♪ Electronic music)

913
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,552
(Grunts)

914
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:25,771
- (Groaning)
- Twist it up.

915
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,731
Let's go.

916
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,530
(Simon) What are they doin'?

917
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,575
It's like they're warming up.

918
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,285
And stretching.

919
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,084
Show 'em your tits.

920
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:50,170
- Huh?
- Lift up your shirt.

921
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,380
- No.
- Just do it.

922
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,185
Whoa!
Check it.

923
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,520
(Chuckles)

924
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,021
- Dude!
- Oh, my God!

925
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,523
Hey, hey!

926
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,108
Where the fuck
are you douchebags goin'?

927
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:13,693
Uh, we'll be right back, Coach.
We gotta take care of something.

928
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:15,237
Yeah.

929
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,572
(Derrick laughs)

930
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:22,619
- They're coming!
- Good.

931
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,621
Lay down
on those tackle dummies.

932
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,124
- Why?
- Trust me.

933
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:28,959
No, on your tummy.
Turn around.

934
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:30,460
Try to look provocative.

935
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,003
(Patty) Huh?

936
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:36,508
Oh. Oh, yeah.

937
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,972
Dude, I told you she was in heat.

938
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,515
Go.

939
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:48,061
Let's double stuff this tard.

940
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,980
(Derrick) Ah, fuck yeah.

941
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:52,983
(Grunting)

942
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:59,281
- Now what?
- Strip 'em.

943
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:23,597
Dump it right in the middle
of this shit fuckin' sandwich.

944
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:26,808
(Gags)

945
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,314
(Polaroid whirs)

946
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:38,153
- Coach?
- Huh?

947
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:40,447
I think the equipment shed
is on fire.

948
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,617
Holy shit.

949
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,911
(Polaroid whirs)

950
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:49,039
Hold this.

951
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:51,875
Wake up, cat fuckers!

952
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,045
Come here.
It's a little memento.

953
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,672
You ever call her a retard again,

954
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:00,550
and this bitch is gonna haunt you
for the rest of your fuckin' life.

955
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,344
(Breathes heavily)

956
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:05,472
(Laughs) Catfuckers!

957
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:10,810
Let's beat it.

958
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:20,028
(Laughs)

959
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:23,281
Come on! Let's go!
Woohoo!

960
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,407
(Patty giggles)

961
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,789

962
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,670
Fucking' punk!

963
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:39,506
What in the fuck is going on?

964
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:42,092
Jesus fuck!
Get up!

965
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:43,677
Get up!

966
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:46,012
- (Yelling)
- (Laughing)

967
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:49,349
- Fuck, yeah!
- Fuck those jock assholes!

968
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:52,102
Oh, my God!
That was just like TV!

969
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:55,021
Man, fuck TV!
That was some raw ass shit!

970
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:56,856
- Simon?
- Yeah?

971
01:02:56,982 --> 01:03:00,402
- Are we going to jail?
- Probably.

972
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,036
(Door chime rings)

973
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:15,875
Welcome to Pet Zone.
How may I assist you today?

974
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:18,545
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean?

975
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:21,715
Why are you working here?

976
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,883
Uh... I don't know
what you mean.

977
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:26,011
Where's your smock?

978
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,096
Why are you putting stickers
on the cat food?

979
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,432
- Mr. Hanley?
- (Mr. Hanley) Yes?

980
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,686
Mr. Hanley, what...
what is she doing here?

981
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:40,275
You said that you were going back
to cleaning out the cages yourself

982
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,486
because Michigan
was raising the minimum wage.

983
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:47,490
Look, Patty, you're a nice
enough kid and all,

984
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:50,327
but let's face it,
you're a little slow.

985
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:56,207
Too slow for what,
this crummy ass pet store?

986
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,752
Where's her fuckin' check?

987
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,046
Rebecca, why don't you, uh...

988
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:02,881
head back to the grooming
station and take your break.

989
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:04,966
Uh-uh. Don't you listen
to this geezer.

990
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:09,346
- I want you to stay put.
- It's OK.

991
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:12,140
Why do you keep
fuckin' lookin' at her?

992
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,266
(Sticker gun clicks)

993
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,727
I am not slow, Mr. Hanley,

994
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:20,190
and I know where everything in
this store is better than you!

995
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,275
And especially her!

996
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,736
Where's the goddamn paycheck?

997
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:25,987
I told Patty I'd put it in the mail
at the end of the week.

998
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:30,992
- It is the end of the week!
- I want my motherfucking check!

999
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,244
(Both yelling)

1000
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:38,166
(♪ Hawaiian music)

1001
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,428
- You know what you want?
- I'll have the Hawaiian.

1002
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:54,933
Hawaiian, huh?

1003
01:04:56,309 --> 01:05:00,688
It has a pineapple ring
and a slice of ham on top.

1004
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,816
What kind of sauce?

1005
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:05,485
Hm, I don't know.

1006
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,654
Hey, what kind of sauce
comes on the Hawaiian?

1007
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:09,906
Like, a honey glaze.

1008
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,333
All right,
two Hawaiian sandwiches.

1009
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:31,177
You want some
of my Jimbo fries?

1010
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:35,014
Yeah, all right.

1011
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,897
- So, is this, like, a date?
- Hmm?

1012
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,025
Are we on a date?

1013
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,489
No, this is a shitty lunch.

1014
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:59,914
Besides, I thought you
were in love with John Q.

1015
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:04,043
Yeah, but he's not real.
He's just my music boyfriend.

1016
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:08,047
Well, I'm gonna take you
to see PSYOPS tomorrow night.

1017
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:10,008
You're gonna see
your music boyfriend.

1018
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:16,347
Well, is that a date?

1019
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:18,391
Yeah, it's a date.

1020
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:26,441
Simon?

1021
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:32,155
You can kiss me now.

1022
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:34,407
It's OK.

1023
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:37,368
I want you to.

1024
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:52,967
(♪ Electronic music)

1025
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:09,817
You can fuck off now.

1026
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:11,444
(Patty laughs)

1027
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,494
You're a real good kisser.

1028
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,037
(Chuckles)

1029
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:23,998
Seriously.

1030
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:27,252
I would not have guessed that.

1031
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:31,047
- Thanks.
- (Grunts)

1032
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:37,262
I guess all my practice
with Kevin really pays off.

1033
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:45,061
What?

1034
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:48,147
Well, he's not
my real brother. Duh.

1035
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:49,941
He's adopted.

1036
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:58,157
I'm just fucking with you.

1037
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:02,745
(Laughs)

1038
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,330
You need to take it
down a notch.

1039
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:06,332
(Laughs)

1040
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:08,084
You need to take it
down a notch.

1041
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:11,296
And you! You need to take it
down a notch, too.

1042
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:13,006
(Patty laughs)

1043
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:23,182
- So much for job hunting, huh?
- Fuck job hunting.

1044
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:24,851
(Chuckles)

1045
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:28,104
I'll drive you around tomorrow
in the truck.

1046
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:29,731
Sweet.

1047
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:37,655
- Hey, you wanna go fuck around?
- Yeah, sure.

1048
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,949

I'm John Q. from PSYOPS.

1224
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:01,857
You're not John Q.
Nobody knows who John Q. is.

1225
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:06,612
Don't you think that maybe
John Q. knows who John Q. is?

1226
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:08,655
(Laughs)

1227
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:10,616
What?

1228
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:13,911
(Laughs)

1229
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:17,081
Close your eyes.

1230

(Zipper unzips)

1231
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:21,752

(Laughs)

1233
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:40,604

(Chuckles)

1235
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:47,736
Big deal.

1236
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:50,072
Looks just like the one I had
for Toboggan Club.

1237
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,742
Smell it.

1238
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,123
(Sniffs)

1239
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:00,457
Ugh.

1240
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:03,043
It smells like the headphones
on the hearing van.

1241
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,295
That's the sweat of every show
we've ever played

1242
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:07,256
trapped in this fucker.

1243
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:10,342
That's the smell
of rock and roll.

(Chuckles)

1245
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,595
What?

1246
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:16,056
You're still not convinced?

1247
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,609
Oh, my God.

1248
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:34,158
You are John Q.

1249
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:39,037
That's fuckin' awkward, huh?

1250
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:41,290
I mean, not as awkward
as beating off to a torso

1251
01:22:41,415 --> 01:22:45,169
on a cartoon bedspread
for two years, I guess.

1252
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:52,217
You have any idea how worked up
those Polaroids got me?

1253
01:22:57,181 --> 01:22:58,807
Did you write all those?

1254
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:04,229
Fuckin' A.

1255
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:05,856
How?

1256
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:09,651
I mean, you call them
love poems,

1257
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:13,030
but they're really these...
these brilliant power pop songs.

1258
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:17,201
I mean, they're fuckin' genius.

1259
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:24,249
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

1260
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,881
Will you say something to me?

1261
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:32,758
Are you all right?

1262
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:41,308
(♪ Electronic music)

1263
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:43,435
No, leave it.

1264
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,105
Violate me.

1265
01:23:48,232 --> 01:23:49,900

1271
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:31,858

01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:38,240
OK, hit it.

- Yeah.

1282

I'm not on dope.

He totally is, Mom. I can tell.
He won't look at me.

but not into my eyes

- If it's about money, no way.

Well, don't worry about it.
I'm not after your goddamn money.

There's always an agenda.

my jewelry box before he bails.

- He's high, Mom.

Don't pay attention to him.
It's what he wants.

1353

He feeds off it.

Hey, sorry I'm late.
Why is the front door locked?

1358
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:20,540
Oh.
What are you doin' here?

1359
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:24,628
- Hi. I'm Danny.
- Hi.

1360
01:30:24,753 --> 01:30:27,297
- Did you give him your key?
- Yeah. So?

1361
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:28,632
Why'd you do that?

1362
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:30,175
You know he's not supposed
to be in here, right?

1363
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:33,511
- Relax, Renae.
- I need to relax, Danny?

1364
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:35,180
Poor Mom had to come home

1365
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:36,848
and find these two
in the basement shooting up.

1366
01:30:36,973 --> 01:30:38,141
Oh, my God.

1367
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:40,268
(Sighs)

1368
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:41,519
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.

1369
01:30:41,645 --> 01:30:43,563
Nobody's shooting dope,
all right?

1370
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:46,358
We were writing a song
in the basement.

1371
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:47,734
I can't do this anymore!

1372
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:49,611
Great, now Dad's upset.

1373
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:51,738
Stop picking on Simon!

1374
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:54,616
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

1375
01:30:54,741 --> 01:30:56,242
You're all being mean!

1376
01:30:57,702 --> 01:30:58,703
He doesn't do dope.

1377
01:30:58,828 --> 01:31:00,705
He just ate Sunday and Monday
from my EZ-Dose

1378
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:02,791
- because he got beat up.

1379
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:04,167
Mommy, what is she talking about?

1380
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:07,379
I have no idea. I think she's
just as strung out as he is.

1381
01:31:07,504 --> 01:31:09,297
OK, you know what?
Leave her out of this.

1382
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:11,883
Look, you seem
like a nice enough girl,

1383
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:13,551
but I'm sure
he's got you brainwashed

1384
01:31:13,677 --> 01:31:16,137
or he's manipulating you
with drugs somehow.

1385
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:18,640
Simon is a pathological liar.

1386
01:31:18,765 --> 01:31:22,227
He's a thief and a total pyro.

1387
01:31:22,352 --> 01:31:23,687
Hey, you know the cops have been
sniffing around for you?

1388
01:31:23,812 --> 01:31:24,813
Yeah.

1389
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:26,481
They came by the office
and grilled me for a half hour.

1390
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:29,484
Oh, God.
Oh, no.

1391
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:32,028
It's OK, Mom.
He'll be gone soon.

1392
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:33,780
What's a pyro again?

1393
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:36,366
- A pyro's...
- Oh. Are you serious?

1394
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:39,035
OK, you know what?
Knock it off! Knock it off!

1395
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:42,163
- Not the sharpest stick, is she?
- Don't talk about her like that!

1396
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:44,290
- Like what?
