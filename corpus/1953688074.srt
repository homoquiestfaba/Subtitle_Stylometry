1
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:33,595
All new planes...

2
00:00:33,892 --> 00:00:35,539
Congratulation Mr. Avery.

3
00:00:35,895 --> 00:00:39,383
You're in the system, you're
good to go, so by next week.

4
00:00:39,814 --> 00:00:42,693
I can't come next week,
I have a business prospects elsewhere.

5
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,785
Oh, good for you, sir. Are you
going to go work at another FedEx?

6
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:48,826
Should go to window seven...

7
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,724
In here.

8
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:02,531
Is everything ready?

9
00:02:05,735 --> 00:02:07,608
It's $3,000, as discussed.

10
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:17,813
The exact name you asked for.

11
00:02:23,987 --> 00:02:25,921
It's not a real...

12
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:29,258
I mean, these numbers belong
to a real human being?

13
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,496
Arthur J. Newman, born
Tulsa, Oklahoma, 1964.

14
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:38,467
Died Visalia, California,
2010.

15
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:41,036
A real human being.

16
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:45,341
Good luck, Mr. Newman.

17
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:09,030
I already did the mustard.

18
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:19,207
By the way, did I mention I'm
going camping this weekend?

19
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,144
Talbot Island State Park.

20
00:03:23,146 --> 00:03:28,549
well, it's right on the beach,
about 16 miles from

21
00:03:28,551 --> 00:03:29,484
Jacksonville proper.

22
00:03:29,486 --> 00:03:31,252
No, you didn't.

23
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:35,289
Well, it was more or less a
spur of the moment decision.

24
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:39,527
You see, I was thinking what
is the most economical

25
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:42,296
vacation that I...

26
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:43,531
that we could take...

27
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:48,802
on my limited budget and, well,
it dawned on me I used

28
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:53,840
to be a Boy Scout leader,
and I had a tent, and a

29
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:56,977
sleeping bad, and...

30
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:00,514
well, actually, I didn't think
you'd want to come, what with

31
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,417
the sand, sea creatures, and...

32
00:04:06,722 --> 00:04:09,356
like I said, it was more
or less a spur

33
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:10,957
of the moment decision.

34
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:16,129
Thanks for the hot dog, Wallace.

35
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,265
I got to go back to work.

36
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,684
This is Arthur J. Newman calling
in reference to the

37
00:04:37,686 --> 00:04:41,520
380SL convertible I'll be
purchasing tomorrow.

38
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:44,723
I was hoping I could
come in at...

39
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:45,991
at 9 AM instead.

40
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:47,460
I have an important
business meeting

41
00:04:47,462 --> 00:04:49,095
tomorrow, and I was hoping...

42
00:04:51,222 --> 00:04:53,363
No problem.
I'll see you at noon.

43
00:04:53,758 --> 00:04:55,468
Thank you very much.

44
00:05:44,016 --> 00:05:46,518
Hey.

45
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,919
We saw you spying on
us again last night.

46
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:54,859
I just came by to say I was
going to Talbot Island State

47
00:05:54,861 --> 00:05:56,895
Park today.

48
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:59,497
Campground on a beach near,
uh, Jacksonville.

49
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:05,770
Anyway, I brought you a gift.

50
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:07,205
Just 'cause, uh...

51
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,767
Hey, I'm Arthur Newman.

52
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:28,135
Uh, how's it going?

53
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:30,137
How's life treatin' you, friend?

54
00:09:33,775 --> 00:09:36,310
I'm Arthur Newman!

55
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:38,812
Hey, there!

56
00:09:38,814 --> 00:09:40,614
Yep.

57
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:43,183
Yep, it's Arthur New...

58
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:46,253
Yep, it's Arthur Newman.

59
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:47,654
That's me.

60
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:13,246
I don't have a permanent
address yet, friend, but as

61
00:10:13,248 --> 00:10:14,814
soon as I get one, I'll
mail it to you so

62
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:17,350
your form is complete.

63
00:10:17,352 --> 00:10:18,751
Good.

64
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,990
Excuse me.

65
00:10:23,992 --> 00:10:27,827
I do not choose to partake
of pornography, sir.

66
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:29,762
This is an extremely
inappropriate subject matter

67
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:32,298
for public venue.

68
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,666
OK.

69
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:55,822
Get out of the car, miss!

70
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:59,725
You stole my car, you
fuckin' crazy bitch!

71
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:04,363
We're going to have to get you out

72
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:06,465
of there, now!

73
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:07,432
Whoa!

74
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:08,433
God!

75
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,068
I know my rights!

76
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,572
I have a college education!

77
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:16,007
Uh!

78
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,276
Uh oh, here's trouble.

79
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:23,482
Just call your wife, see if
she wants her car back!

80
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:25,584
I just borrowed it!

81
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:37,195
Show's over.

82
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,563
Everybody go home.

83
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:49,307
Yeah.

84
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:52,010
My ex-husband.

85
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,246
Actually, spying.

86
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:56,014
You know what's crazy?

87
00:11:56,016 --> 00:12:00,652
When we were married, he avoided
Kevin like the plague.

88
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:03,220
Well, and now...

89
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,957
it's a strange way to
feel connected.

90
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,493
You know what's so
sad about it?

91
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,295
He was kind of great once.

92
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,008
Good times!

93
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:30,915
Yeah, good times!

94
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,017
I want to have some good times!

95
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:46,797
I like 'em fat, I like 'em tall,
I like them stubby, I

96
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,866
like them all.

97
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,935
I like them stubby.

98
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:55,306
Hello?

99
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:01,578
Are you OK?

100
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,779
Show's over.

101
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:05,815
Go home.

102
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,587
Um...

103
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,857
Don't touch me.

104
00:13:15,485 --> 00:13:16,953
OK.

105
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:21,097
You need to see a doctor.

106
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:24,067
Don't touch me.

107
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:31,741
I'm going to try
to help you, OK?

108
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:32,809
I won't touch you.

109
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:36,713
I won't use my hands.

110
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:41,184
You lift your arms up, like this, up.

111
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:43,119
Put your arm around my neck.

112
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:47,790
That way I can life you up
using my own body weight.

113
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:50,593
No contact whatsoever
with my hands.

114
00:13:50,595 --> 00:13:52,894
Can you do that?

115
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:56,331
Put your arm around my neck.

116
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,733
OK?

117
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,138
There, good job.

118
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,074
No hands.

119
00:14:06,076 --> 00:14:10,746
OK, now, give me your...
give me your other arm.

120
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:12,114
OK, ready?

121
00:14:15,652 --> 00:14:19,388
I can feel your hand.

122
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,356
My name is Arthur Newman.

123
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:23,859
Arthur J. Newman.

124
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:27,629
Driver's license, Social
Security, any form of ID.

125
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:38,006
Are you Michaela Fitzgerald?

126
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:43,311
They need to know your name.

127
00:14:43,313 --> 00:14:48,149
Are you Mic... are you Michaela
Fitzgerald without peroxide?

128
00:14:48,151 --> 00:14:49,550
Call me Mike.

129
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:03,798
How's life treating you?

130
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,399
No complaints.

131
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:08,869
Yeah, that's what
we like to hear.

132
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:11,839
Hey, just out of curiosity, did
you happen to hear about a

133
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:14,108
car theft around here
this evening?

134
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,910
Woman allegedly stole a Chevy?

135
00:15:15,912 --> 00:15:20,014
You just admitted the gal.

136
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:22,383
Actually, I...

137
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:23,851
I'm just going a good deed.

138
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:25,653
I don't know her.

139
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:28,522
The guy with the Chevy didn't
know her either.

140
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:30,224
Picked her up at the Beach
Comber, took her

141
00:15:30,226 --> 00:15:34,462
Had to drop the charges when the
old Mustang Sally fixed to

142
00:15:34,464 --> 00:15:35,863
call his wife from jail.

143
00:15:35,865 --> 00:15:38,399
Mr. Arthur Newman?

144
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:39,967
Overdosed on what?

145
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:43,403
It's a morphine-based cough
syrup, very powerful narcotic.

146
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:44,904
She drank two bottles of it.

147
00:15:44,906 --> 00:15:48,875
When I asked her why, she said
she had a bad cough.

148
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:51,845
We're cleaning her our with
an intravenous feed.

149
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:53,346
She should be fine
in the morning.

150
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:54,080
Cough syrup?

151
00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:55,482
She's in there.

152
00:16:08,729 --> 00:16:11,231
Hey now, don't you look
sharp as a tack?

153
00:16:15,503 --> 00:16:18,338
In case you don't remember,
I'm Arthur.

154
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,509
I brought you here.

155
00:16:22,511 --> 00:16:26,980
Did I have sex with you?

156
00:16:26,982 --> 00:16:29,382
No.

157
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:30,784
Absolutely not.

158
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:36,522
Anyway, I just can't buy to...

159
00:16:36,524 --> 00:16:38,223
Don't leave me alone.

160
00:16:38,225 --> 00:16:39,525
...how you were getting along.

161
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:41,426
Stay here with me.

162
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:43,896
And then take me with
you in the morning

163
00:16:43,898 --> 00:16:45,931
when the sun is shining.

164
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:48,233
Please?

165
00:16:48,235 --> 00:16:49,134
OK, OK.

166
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:51,403
I'll stay.

167
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:52,905
For a while.

168
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:13,292
I'm not asleep yet.

169
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:29,933
Hello, Mike.

170
00:18:32,536 --> 00:18:35,538
Well, maybe you don't
remember me.

171
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,107
I'm Arthur.

172
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:38,341
Arthur J. Newman.

173
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:39,342
And I...

174
00:18:39,344 --> 00:18:41,645
I saved you.

175
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:43,013
Well, I...

176
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:44,414
I helped you.

177
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,852
You said you'd stay.

178
00:18:48,854 --> 00:18:50,220
You left.

179
00:19:06,637 --> 00:19:08,138
Where would you like
me to take you?

180
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:07,496
Should I put the top up?

181
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:08,897
No.

182
00:20:26,415 --> 00:20:28,750
Would you like a hot
dog or nachos?

183
00:20:28,752 --> 00:20:31,319
No.

184
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:32,720
OK.

185
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:41,062
Forgot something.

186
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:53,007
Is that where you
hide your money?

187
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:54,909
I'm not hiding anything, Mike.

188
00:20:57,312 --> 00:20:58,179
Arthur?

189
00:20:58,181 --> 00:20:58,946
Yes, Mike?

190
00:20:58,948 --> 00:21:00,748
What's your story?

191
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,649
My story?

192
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:04,819
What kind of a human being am I?

193
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:06,154
I mean, what's your story.

194
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:08,456
I'm a golf pro.

195
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,257
You mean...

196
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:11,559
you're no Tiger Woods.

197
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,527
Actually, Mike, I've won
quite a few prestigious

198
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:17,464
But to tell you the truth, life
on the road is wearing me

199
00:21:17,466 --> 00:21:19,266
down, so I'm taking a gig.

200
00:21:19,268 --> 00:21:23,203
Resident pro at a course in
Terre Haute, Indiana.

201
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:25,439
Were are you going, anyway?

202
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:27,774
I don't know.

203
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:29,776
Would you like a ride
to Terre Haute?

204
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:31,378
No, I wouldn't.

205
00:21:40,354 --> 00:21:42,422
Where are the real hot dogs?

206
00:21:42,424 --> 00:21:43,657
Um, we don't have
them anymore.

207
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:45,125
Just the tofu dogs.

208
00:21:45,127 --> 00:21:47,427
How is that possible?

209
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:49,930
Not all of us want the
healthy alternative.

210
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,300
Look, Mike, tofu dogs.

211
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,791
Because I choose to be
health-conscious.

212
00:22:06,515 --> 00:22:10,116
I got you a small token.

213
00:22:10,118 --> 00:22:11,584
Thank you, Wallace.

214
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:13,052
I love alligators.

215
00:22:13,054 --> 00:22:16,088
It's my pleasure.

216
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,723
What did you call me?

217
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:19,492
Wallace.

218
00:22:19,494 --> 00:22:21,894
Wallace Avery, right?

219
00:22:21,896 --> 00:22:24,363
I found it in the side pocket
of your golf bag.

220
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:26,160
The trunk was locked.
I locked it.

221
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:29,041
I used to work at Lock & Key.
I was really good.

222
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:35,405
You know, on second thought,
I think I will ride to Terre Haute with you.

223
00:22:58,266 --> 00:22:59,665
Payments.

224
00:23:01,468 --> 00:23:02,834
Yes, this is Ms. Mina Crawley.

225
00:23:06,338 --> 00:23:09,307
Yes, I do know a Mr. Wallace
Avery, and you can tell him

226
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:11,242
that I took the bus to
work this morning.

227
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:15,313
Park what?

228
00:23:18,184 --> 00:23:22,153
What are you saying to me?

229
00:23:22,155 --> 00:23:23,555
Look, so you're phony.

230
00:23:23,557 --> 00:23:24,923
What's the big deal?

231
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:27,492
One-way ticket to Durham,
North Carolina, please.

232
00:23:27,494 --> 00:23:31,763
I saw it in your driver's license.

233
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:35,567
That's... that's not my...
look, I hate Durham!

234
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:36,901
Does the lady want
her ticket or not?

235
00:23:36,903 --> 00:23:40,705
I reject the ticket!

236
00:23:40,707 --> 00:23:42,173
Get your hands off me!

237
00:23:42,175 --> 00:23:45,610
I reject the ticket!

238
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:47,078
I feel dizzy.

239
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,079
You're fine!

240
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:50,048
My hands are numb.

241
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,383
I got a sick man here.

242
00:23:54,954 --> 00:23:56,688
Is anybody a doctor?

243
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,621
Wait, wait.

244
00:23:57,623 --> 00:23:59,056
Hang on here, now.

245
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:03,260
He just started convulsing
or something.

246
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:06,430
Who can help him?

247
00:24:06,432 --> 00:24:07,831
Someone's got to help him.

248
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,036
Uh, I...

249
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:14,671
I can't, um...

250
00:24:34,793 --> 00:24:36,526
I don't know how
to... somebody!

251
00:25:16,733 --> 00:25:19,335
Thanks for trying.

252
00:25:19,337 --> 00:25:21,137
Who is he?

253
00:25:21,139 --> 00:25:22,004
John Doe.

254
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:24,040
Can't find an ID on him.

255
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:26,342
Poor guy.

256
00:25:26,344 --> 00:25:28,144
What a way to go.

257
00:25:32,283 --> 00:25:35,117
Well, thanks for
trying, anyways.

258
00:25:37,455 --> 00:25:38,821
What is wrong with you?

259
00:25:46,096 --> 00:25:51,394
Poor John Doe, what a way to go,
poor John Doe.

260
00:25:54,404 --> 00:25:56,304
It's not funny.

261
00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:08,516
Oh, please don't make me get
on that bus, Wallace.

262
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,390
That was a very funny
joke, Wallace.

263
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,165
Getting lost on Talbot Island.

264
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:32,533
Ha ha ha.

265
00:27:42,342 --> 00:27:44,210
Wallace?

266
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:46,779
You can come out now.

267
00:28:14,575 --> 00:28:16,609
I can't sleep in my room.

268
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:38,697
What are you doing?

269
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:39,831
See my glasses?

270
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:41,766
I thought I left...

271
00:28:41,768 --> 00:28:42,734
I thought I left them...

272
00:28:42,736 --> 00:28:44,135
No.

273
00:29:04,657 --> 00:29:09,227
His hands were all calloused.

274
00:29:09,229 --> 00:29:13,198
Especially his left hand,
around the wedding ring.

275
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,102
How do you know that?

276
00:29:17,104 --> 00:29:19,170
Because I held his hand.

277
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:26,378
By the way, that was very
kind of you, Mike.

278
00:30:28,573 --> 00:30:29,539
Same guy.

279
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:30,940
Wallace Avery.

280
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:03,031
How's life treatin' you?

281
00:32:07,737 --> 00:32:09,104
Keep the change.

282
00:32:16,178 --> 00:32:19,146
Who are you?

283
00:32:19,148 --> 00:32:20,514
I mean, really?

284
00:32:22,517 --> 00:32:25,219
I guess I've always
been Arthur Newman.

285
00:32:25,221 --> 00:32:28,022
Wife just forced another
individual on me.

286
00:32:28,024 --> 00:32:30,524
Wallace Avery was
such a nothing?

287
00:32:30,526 --> 00:32:32,793
Actually, Mike, Wallace Avery
was manager of a large,

288
00:32:32,795 --> 00:32:34,395
multinational corporation.

289
00:32:34,397 --> 00:32:36,597
What, like Blackwater
or evil empire...

290
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:37,998
No, Federal Express.

291
00:32:40,836 --> 00:32:42,169
Well, I ran a branch in Orlando.

292
00:32:45,807 --> 00:32:47,808
Well, I was floor manager.

293
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,644
Oh, Jesus!

294
00:32:50,646 --> 00:32:53,080
No wonder you want to
be Arthur Newman.

295
00:32:56,752 --> 00:32:57,785
Why the gold angle?

296
00:32:57,787 --> 00:33:01,088
I just happen to be a
very good golfer.

297
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:08,728
Last spring at Diamondback
Golf Club, I observed a

298
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,231
gentleman taking
practice shots.

299
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:13,533
He had some serious issues with
his swing, and I offered

300
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:17,270
him some, quite frankly,
valuable advise.

301
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:20,140
And the next thing I know, this
gentleman grabs me on the

302
00:33:20,142 --> 00:33:22,876
16th fairway and he says,
"Sir, you are a godsend.

303
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:25,301
I'm shooting like my old self
again. " And he tells me he

304
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,981
owns a private golf club in
Terre Haute, Indiana, and I am

305
00:33:27,983 --> 00:33:29,382
welcome there any time.

306
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:38,217
Well, that moment, Mike,
I had an epiphany.

307
00:33:39,757 --> 00:33:42,208
"Sir," I said,
"My name is Arthur Newman. "

308
00:33:43,257 --> 00:33:45,070
It just popped out of my mouth.

309
00:33:45,105 --> 00:33:48,601
"And I have recently returned
stateside after 15 years

310
00:33:48,603 --> 00:33:51,938
abroad on Asian tours,"
and did he need a teaching

311
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,640
pro, I asked him.

312
00:33:53,642 --> 00:33:56,743
He shook my hand, and
he said, "Arthur,

313
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:58,845
consider yourself hired.

314
00:33:58,847 --> 00:34:03,315
I'll see you in Terre
Haute next summer. "

315
00:34:03,317 --> 00:34:06,585
So you just ditched Wallace
Avery for a total stranger's

316
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:07,953
half-baked promise?

317
00:34:14,994 --> 00:34:17,095
How very good are you?

318
00:34:22,302 --> 00:34:23,569
See that tractor?

319
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:26,171
I'm going to hit it.

320
00:34:29,043 --> 00:34:31,009
Huh!

321
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:32,010
Cool!

322
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,113
See the truck?

323
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,360
Oh!

324
00:35:13,553 --> 00:35:16,420
Can I ask you a personal question?

325
00:35:16,422 --> 00:35:20,324
I don't know, can you?

326
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:28,232
Where you going to
go after we get to

327
00:35:28,234 --> 00:35:30,701
Terre Haute?

328
00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:32,169
I don't know.

329
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,571
I guess...

330
00:35:38,076 --> 00:35:40,378
Don't you have a place?

331
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,879
You know, a...

332
00:35:45,784 --> 00:35:47,285
A, I a home owner?

333
00:35:47,287 --> 00:35:50,454
Don't you have,
you know, a family?

334
00:35:53,925 --> 00:35:56,559
No, not really.

335
00:35:56,561 --> 00:35:57,994
No dad?

336
00:35:57,996 --> 00:35:58,962
No.

337
00:35:58,964 --> 00:35:59,729
Mom?

338
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:01,031
Killed herself.

339
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:06,403
I'm so sorry.

340
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,118
You have siblings?

341
00:36:13,778 --> 00:36:17,714
I have a twin sister in
a loony bin, Arthur.

342
00:36:17,716 --> 00:36:19,916
I put her there for the fourth
time right before I met you.

343
00:36:19,918 --> 00:36:21,952
So you see, I really don't
have that much family.

344
00:36:27,658 --> 00:36:30,460
Twin sister?

345
00:36:30,462 --> 00:36:33,196
As an identical twin sister?

346
00:36:33,198 --> 00:36:34,597
Good night, Arthur.

347
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:41,137
By any chance, does your twin
sister have short, blond hair?

348
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:43,406
Lives in Durham, and you're
carrying her driver's license?

349
00:36:47,645 --> 00:36:49,878
You really think you're the
only person walking around

350
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,046
with someone else's ID?

351
00:36:51,048 --> 00:36:52,781
How is this possible?

352
00:36:52,783 --> 00:36:55,384
I mean, you both...

353
00:36:55,386 --> 00:36:56,585
we're both...

354
00:36:56,587 --> 00:36:58,520
is this why you agreed
to come with me?

355
00:36:58,522 --> 00:37:02,157
Look, don't think this makes
us any closer, OK?

356
00:37:09,132 --> 00:37:10,532
So...

357
00:37:13,437 --> 00:37:15,004
Who are you?

358
00:37:15,006 --> 00:37:16,772
what's your name?

359
00:37:38,629 --> 00:37:40,029
Hey...

360
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:47,068
so sorry.

361
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,469
My questions upset you, Mike?

362
00:37:54,877 --> 00:37:56,277
My name is Charlotte.

363
00:37:59,681 --> 00:38:01,049
Kevin, over here!

364
00:38:01,051 --> 00:38:02,483
Watch me!

365
00:38:02,485 --> 00:38:03,451
Over here!

366
00:38:03,453 --> 00:38:05,887
Watch me!

367
00:38:08,124 --> 00:38:10,491
Fuck off, Jamie!

368
00:38:10,493 --> 00:38:14,195
Nice trip, dumb ass!

369
00:38:14,197 --> 00:38:16,597
There's someone here who'd like
to speak with you about

370
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:17,965
your father.

371
00:38:19,535 --> 00:38:20,601
This is Mina Crawley.

372
00:38:20,603 --> 00:38:22,236
She is a friend of Wallace's.

373
00:38:22,238 --> 00:38:25,139
I'm a dear, dear friend
of your dad's.

374
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:27,041
He... he spoke so much about you.

375
00:38:27,043 --> 00:38:29,010
It's a genuine pleasure to...

376
00:38:29,012 --> 00:38:31,579
you do resemble him here.

377
00:38:31,581 --> 00:38:33,448
Your father went camping
five days ago

378
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,882
and he hasn't returned.

379
00:38:34,884 --> 00:38:38,285
At Talbot State Park at, um...

380
00:38:38,287 --> 00:38:39,319
at the ocean.

381
00:38:39,321 --> 00:38:42,589
The Atlantic Ocean.

382
00:38:42,591 --> 00:38:45,258
The police are searching for
him, but so far, they have

383
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,461
found nothing, and they've...

384
00:38:47,463 --> 00:38:49,296
Crawley they're very concerned.

385
00:38:57,172 --> 00:39:01,108
Yeah, well, nice to
meet you, I guess.

386
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:24,764
Hey, Charlotte!

387
00:39:24,766 --> 00:39:26,166
Charlotte!

388
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:36,609
Why are you standing in the
middle of the street, Arthur?

389
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:38,338
I thought you'd...

390
00:39:39,186 --> 00:39:41,069
Look.

391
00:39:50,725 --> 00:39:52,124
OK!

392
00:39:52,126 --> 00:39:53,259
Come on, Arthur!

393
00:39:53,261 --> 00:39:55,161
Let's follow them!

394
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:45,510
Why don't we just return the
veil and get out of here?

395
00:40:49,982 --> 00:40:51,182
Oh, they're leaving.

396
00:40:51,184 --> 00:40:52,951
Let's just give it to them.

397
00:40:52,953 --> 00:40:53,851
No, no, no.

398
00:40:53,853 --> 00:40:55,887
Wait, wait.

399
00:40:58,024 --> 00:41:00,058
They're going on their
honeymoon, Arthur!

400
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,168
Oh, that's very exciting.

401
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,855
They are seniors, Mike.
I'm not sure "exciting" is the...

402
00:41:05,932 --> 00:41:07,298
Shhh.

403
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:31,421
Mike.

404
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,927
Mike, I don't like this.

405
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:46,336
Mike, what we're doing
is returning the veil.

406
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:47,471
Why don't you just...

407
00:41:47,473 --> 00:41:49,172
just leave it on the porch?

408
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,574
Shh!

409
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:56,013
Mike?

410
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:05,656
Mike, just set it on the
kitchen table and... and get

411
00:42:05,658 --> 00:42:08,558
out of there.

412
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,926
Mike?

413
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,064
Mike, what are you doing?

414
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,640
Get down here!

415
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:25,941
Mike.

416
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,343
Right now!

417
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,950
Eugene, git on up here

418
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,686
and act like a husband.

419
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:38,454
Now, that is...

420
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:39,622
inappro...

421
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:41,657
take that thing off right now.

422
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,759
You take it off.

423
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,161
It's your honeymoon.

424
00:42:55,872 --> 00:42:57,473
Come 'ere, Gene.

425
00:42:57,475 --> 00:43:00,576
Lie down beside me.

426
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,011
Mike, cut it out, really.

427
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:03,412
It's... it's wrong.

428
00:43:05,615 --> 00:43:08,250
Wrong?

429
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:13,489
Is love wrong on our weddin' day?

430
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:16,458
It's not what I...

431
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,660
what I mean is,
is pretending to be...

432
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,929
We deserve to be
happy, Eugene.

433
00:43:27,069 --> 00:43:29,404
I'm not Eugene and you're not...

434
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:30,805
I know.

435
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,884
Let me be your joy, Eugene.

436
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:48,123
Take my love, all of it.

437
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,924
You'll be my happiness, too.

438
00:43:53,095 --> 00:43:54,629
Come 'ere, husband.

439
00:44:23,492 --> 00:44:25,893
Can I be myself, please?

440
00:44:37,439 --> 00:44:38,939
Oh, what the hell?

441
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:40,307
Just skooch over.

442
00:44:45,613 --> 00:44:49,149
First thing I'm gonna
do in the AM is I'm

443
00:44:49,151 --> 00:44:51,485
going to take down those photos
by the stairs, and I'm

444
00:44:51,487 --> 00:44:56,457
gonna put up one great,
big, life size picture of you.

445
00:44:58,007 --> 00:45:01,781
Use the whole,

446
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:07,741
the whole house, whole universe,
just to glorify you.

447
00:45:14,208 --> 00:45:16,642
Love you, you know that?

448
00:45:16,644 --> 00:45:20,279
Like the stars love
the night sky.

449
00:45:37,699 --> 00:45:39,065
Turn over.

450
00:45:54,114 --> 00:45:56,716
Sweet savior, you
are beautiful.

451
00:46:47,266 --> 00:46:49,768
Kevin.

452
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,169
Do you live here?

453
00:46:51,171 --> 00:46:52,170
Uh, no.

454
00:46:52,172 --> 00:46:54,039
Or technically, no, I don't.

455
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:57,274
I've spent a... a lot of time
here, a great deal of time

456
00:46:57,276 --> 00:47:00,144
Some wonderful time.

457
00:47:00,146 --> 00:47:03,514
What were you doing?

458
00:47:03,516 --> 00:47:05,349
Me?

459
00:47:05,351 --> 00:47:06,750
Uh...

460
00:47:06,752 --> 00:47:09,253
I was having some toast.

461
00:47:37,549 --> 00:47:38,949
Oh, my...

462
00:48:09,513 --> 00:48:10,680
Excuse me.

463
00:48:10,682 --> 00:48:13,683
I have to go to work.

464
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:15,985
I've never been here before.

465
00:48:15,987 --> 00:48:17,654
Oh?

466
00:48:17,656 --> 00:48:19,922
He thought if he built a shrine
to me, he could make up

467
00:48:19,924 --> 00:48:23,059
for being such a shitty dad.

468
00:48:23,061 --> 00:48:25,194
Did it ever occur to
him I grew up?

469
00:48:29,566 --> 00:48:31,567
Oh, my goodness.

470
00:48:31,569 --> 00:48:34,570
Uh...

471
00:48:34,572 --> 00:48:35,938
You think he's dead?

472
00:48:40,878 --> 00:48:42,245
I don't know.

473
00:48:48,017 --> 00:48:50,952
Charlotte?

474
00:48:50,954 --> 00:48:51,820
What if we...

475
00:48:51,822 --> 00:48:53,321
Call me Mike.

476
00:50:04,893 --> 00:50:07,895
Come on, come on!

477
00:51:21,102 --> 00:51:26,372
Where have you been all night?

478
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,374
Kevin?

479
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,368
Stay with me, Mike,
in Terre Haute.

480
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:58,136
We both want the same things.

481
00:51:58,138 --> 00:52:00,572
We both need...

482
00:52:00,574 --> 00:52:02,341
Live with me.

483
00:52:02,343 --> 00:52:03,876
You can be Michaela.

484
00:52:03,878 --> 00:52:06,345
I can be Arthur.

485
00:52:06,347 --> 00:52:10,249
We can both have the
lives we want.

486
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:12,751
Finally.

487
00:52:12,753 --> 00:52:14,419
What do you say?

488
00:52:33,473 --> 00:52:36,674
The water pressure
here is superb.

489
00:53:28,326 --> 00:53:31,261
My mom was a paranoid
schizophrenic, Arthur.

490
00:53:33,764 --> 00:53:36,266
And so was my sister.

491
00:53:36,268 --> 00:53:39,069
You can't understand
how scary that is.

492
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:47,711
How can I live with anyone?

493
00:53:47,713 --> 00:53:50,180
I'm a genetic time bomb.

494
00:53:52,985 --> 00:53:57,087
I hear that duck quack,
and I know it's a duck.

495
00:53:57,089 --> 00:53:59,856
But sooner or later, it's going
to be ducks sending me

496
00:53:59,858 --> 00:54:01,191
secret messages, telling me...

497
00:54:10,401 --> 00:54:13,069
When will it be over?

498
00:54:13,071 --> 00:54:15,270
When will I stop being me?

499
00:54:15,272 --> 00:54:16,805
Who says you will?

500
00:54:16,807 --> 00:54:17,940
Statistics.

501
00:54:17,942 --> 00:54:19,942
Someone with my family history...

502
00:54:19,944 --> 00:54:21,343
You're not a statistic, Mike.

503
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:26,081
You're a person who can't defend
herself against her

504
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,449
worst feelings.

505
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:33,789
You feel the things most of us
run away from, the things most

506
00:54:33,791 --> 00:54:38,761
of us are just too bottled up to feel.

507
00:54:53,209 --> 00:54:55,644
Now do I have to
have sex with you?

508
00:54:55,646 --> 00:54:56,912
Because I really
don't want to.

509
00:54:56,914 --> 00:54:59,014
It's all right, it's OK.

510
00:55:55,404 --> 00:55:58,773
I can't get these sons
of bitches out.

511
00:55:58,775 --> 00:56:01,309
Will you help me, Arthur?

512
00:56:04,146 --> 00:56:05,612
Use the brush.

513
00:56:05,614 --> 00:56:07,280
No, the brush will hurt you.

514
00:56:07,282 --> 00:56:08,348
I need to use my hands.

515
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:09,316
OK, go ahead.

516
00:56:09,318 --> 00:56:10,383
Just be...

517
00:56:10,385 --> 00:56:11,918
Careful, I know.

518
00:56:14,755 --> 00:56:17,090
Did you have any
kids, Arthur?

519
00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:25,298
I mean, did Wallace have kids?

520
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,666
No, none.

521
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:58,532
Arthur Newman world.

522
00:56:58,534 --> 00:57:01,534
Yes, we have golf communities
all around the United States,

523
00:57:01,536 --> 00:57:03,602
Let's check it out.

524
00:57:03,604 --> 00:57:06,238
Come on, Arthur, these
are your peeps.

525
00:57:17,617 --> 00:57:21,720
Come on, you can go now.

526
00:57:21,722 --> 00:57:23,155
What's the matter?

527
00:57:23,157 --> 00:57:24,456
I just feel a little dizzy.

528
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:25,824
I just...

529
00:57:25,826 --> 00:57:26,725
I think I need...

530
00:57:26,727 --> 00:57:29,662
You need a hot dog.

531
00:57:29,664 --> 00:57:32,064
A pirate goes into
the bar, and the

532
00:57:32,066 --> 00:57:35,367
bartender says, "Hey, buddy,
you got a steering wheel in

533
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:38,003
And the pirate says, "Aye.

534
00:57:38,005 --> 00:57:42,374
driving me nuts. "

535
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:46,045
Did you ever win a trophy
like that, Arthur?

536
00:57:46,047 --> 00:57:47,580
How many?

537
00:57:47,582 --> 00:57:50,249
Like a few?

538
00:57:50,251 --> 00:57:51,884
A lot?

539
00:57:51,886 --> 00:57:54,620
A lot, a lot, or just a lot.

540
00:57:54,622 --> 00:57:56,654
A lot, a lot, I guess.

541
00:57:56,656 --> 00:57:59,190
How come such a hot
shot had to end up

542
00:57:59,192 --> 00:58:01,759
working at a FedEx, then?

543
00:58:01,761 --> 00:58:02,527
Arthur?

544
00:58:02,529 --> 00:58:04,285
He's choking!

545
00:58:05,405 --> 00:58:06,814
Arthur?
He's choking!

546
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:08,967
He's choking!

547
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,863
Another rough day for Wallace Avery.

548
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,777
He was an outstanding amateur
but can't seem to catch a

549
00:58:19,779 --> 00:58:21,346
break since joining
the PGA Tour.

550
00:58:21,348 --> 00:58:23,414
I know, Frank.

551
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,183
Looks like this once
promising player can't

552
00:58:25,185 --> 00:58:27,952
handle the big time.

553
00:58:27,954 --> 00:58:30,989
Right on cue.

554
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:38,129
Nice job, Larry!

555
00:58:58,283 --> 00:59:00,284
I don't know if I can
pull this off, Mike.

556
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:01,752
Pull what off?

557
00:59:01,754 --> 00:59:02,653
Arthur Newman.

558
00:59:02,655 --> 00:59:04,054
Of course you can.

559
00:59:04,056 --> 00:59:06,890
Just look at him.

560
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:32,115
Hey, you want to
shoot a little pool?

561
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:41,158
Oh, Jesus, you are hot.

562
00:59:55,972 --> 00:59:58,407
Come here, sexy.

563
00:59:58,409 --> 01:00:01,477
Oh, look what you have done.

564
01:00:04,781 --> 01:00:08,046
You know, I have to say, Mike,
you really are an excellent mimic.

565
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:09,757
Mike is man.

566
01:00:10,297 --> 01:00:12,141
I am Ludmilla.

567
01:00:27,304 --> 01:00:28,671
Shit!

568
01:00:31,908 --> 01:00:32,908
Oh!

569
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:35,378
Ow!

570
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:37,346
Times you did that.

571
01:00:56,199 --> 01:00:58,099
Ludmilla!

572
01:01:07,543 --> 01:01:08,309
No.

573
01:01:08,311 --> 01:01:09,711
No!

574
01:02:01,896 --> 01:02:03,897
Golf.

575
01:02:03,899 --> 01:02:06,066
It's a mental game, a
mental component.

576
01:02:06,068 --> 01:02:07,835
That was lacking.

577
01:02:07,837 --> 01:02:10,904
Serious choking problem.

578
01:02:10,906 --> 01:02:12,573
Sorry to hear he's
dead, though.

579
01:02:12,575 --> 01:02:15,809
Yeah, really sorry.

580
01:02:15,811 --> 01:02:18,912
You can almost see
Avery's mind hijack

581
01:02:18,914 --> 01:02:21,114
his instincts.

582
01:02:21,116 --> 01:02:24,084
It's hard to watch a guy get in
his own way over and over

583
01:02:24,086 --> 01:02:25,886
again like this.

584
01:02:25,888 --> 01:02:27,387
Just a mental train wreck.

585
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:53,980
Welcome to Terre Haute
Country Club.

586
01:02:53,982 --> 01:02:55,348
Thank you.

587
01:03:05,894 --> 01:03:06,792
Hello there, April.

588
01:03:06,794 --> 01:03:10,196
We're looking for the owner,
Chuck Willoughby.

589
01:03:10,198 --> 01:03:12,899
Unfortunately, Mr. Willoughby
has gone home for tonight, but

590
01:03:12,901 --> 01:03:13,766
I could call him?

591
01:03:13,768 --> 01:03:14,901
Don't bother, April.

592
01:03:14,903 --> 01:03:16,302
We'll be back in the morning.

593
01:03:29,082 --> 01:03:33,518
Do you want a dirty martini
with two olives?

594
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,520
I'll have a martini with four olives.

595
01:03:35,522 --> 01:03:36,521
Four?

596
01:03:36,523 --> 01:03:37,923
OK.

597
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:42,360
Should I, uh...

598
01:03:42,929 --> 01:03:48,555
should I call you my wife,
my girlfriend, or my fiance?

599
01:03:49,051 --> 01:03:50,936
Your whore.

600
01:03:56,043 --> 01:04:00,845
There's something I'd like to
teach you to do for me, Mike.

601
01:04:00,847 --> 01:04:03,315
Golf.

602
01:04:11,959 --> 01:04:14,092
This...

603
01:04:14,094 --> 01:04:15,627
this is a putter.

604
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,638
- Oh!
- It's for...

605
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:19,766
putting.

606
01:04:21,867 --> 01:04:26,503
Now the most important thing
is a light touch, extremely

607
01:04:26,505 --> 01:04:29,807
light touch on the club, like
you're holding a bird in the

608
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:30,541
palm of your hand.

609
01:04:30,543 --> 01:04:31,342
Your were...

610
01:04:31,344 --> 01:04:33,010
I mean, Wallace Avery...

611
01:04:33,012 --> 01:04:34,244
were married, weren't you?

612
01:04:34,246 --> 01:04:39,617
Now, just tuck... tuck your
fingers together like so.

613
01:04:39,619 --> 01:04:41,118
What was she like, the wife?

614
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,152
There you go.

615
01:04:42,154 --> 01:04:44,088
Good job!

616
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:46,256
She a golfer?

617
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:48,258
Did you teach her how to tuck
her fingers in, too?

618
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:49,026
Bend your knees a little.

619
01:04:49,028 --> 01:04:50,761
Bend your knees.

620
01:04:50,763 --> 01:04:51,862
Keep some spring in them.

621
01:04:51,864 --> 01:04:53,831
Did you love her a lot, Arthur?

622
01:04:53,833 --> 01:04:56,000
Why no kids, huh?

623
01:04:56,002 --> 01:04:57,568
Is there something
wrong with you?

624
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:59,637
Will you stick to the
matter in hand?

625
01:04:59,639 --> 01:05:01,505
What's the big deal?

626
01:05:01,507 --> 01:05:03,974
I told you all about the
insanity in my family, so

627
01:05:03,976 --> 01:05:05,376
what's a little infertility?

628
01:05:05,378 --> 01:05:06,610
There's nothing wrong
with me, Mike.

629
01:05:06,612 --> 01:05:09,513
Maybe you have extremely
weak sperm.

630
01:05:09,515 --> 01:05:10,748
My sperm's fine, thank you.

631
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:12,016
You should probably get it tested.

632
01:05:12,018 --> 01:05:16,319
I think Wallace Avery is in
serious denial about his...

633
01:05:16,321 --> 01:05:19,155
I have a son.

634
01:05:19,157 --> 01:05:20,390
All right?

635
01:05:20,392 --> 01:05:21,858
There's nothing wrong with me.

636
01:05:26,563 --> 01:05:27,930
Arthur, I...

637
01:05:30,001 --> 01:05:32,368
Big whoop, you have a son.

638
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:34,270
Why is that such a big secret?

639
01:05:37,941 --> 01:05:39,308
Arthur?

640
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,209
Uh...

641
01:05:40,211 --> 01:05:41,077
Chuck.

642
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:42,412
Diamond Back.

643
01:05:42,414 --> 01:05:45,715
Yes, it's actually me,
Arthur Newman.

644
01:05:45,717 --> 01:05:47,116
We were told you went home.

645
01:05:47,118 --> 01:05:50,219
We were getting soused at
a bar down the road.

646
01:05:50,221 --> 01:05:51,754
Well, so were we.

647
01:05:51,756 --> 01:05:53,056
Your wonderful bar.

648
01:05:53,058 --> 01:05:55,425
By the way, this is
Michaela Fitzgerald.

649
01:05:55,427 --> 01:05:58,361
Whore.

650
01:05:59,895 --> 01:06:01,236
- Hi.
- Hi.

651
01:06:01,933 --> 01:06:05,568
Beautiful, beautiful.

652
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:07,737
Remember that guy I told
you about, Gary?

653
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:08,838
The pro?

654
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,772
Diamond Back?

655
01:06:09,774 --> 01:06:14,609
I'm going to hire him,
work here, remember?

656
01:06:14,611 --> 01:06:19,414
Well, anyway, we're all systems
go, and then I Google

657
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:23,251
him and find out there's no such
fucking pro ever worked

658
01:06:23,253 --> 01:06:26,021
the Asian circuits called
Arthur Newman.

659
01:06:28,491 --> 01:06:30,959
And here he is.

660
01:06:30,961 --> 01:06:32,861
With a whore.

661
01:06:34,164 --> 01:06:35,731
Fuckin' beautiful!

662
01:06:35,733 --> 01:06:38,300
What am I going to do, Gary?

663
01:06:38,302 --> 01:06:42,437
What am I going to do
with this liar?

664
01:06:42,439 --> 01:06:43,805
Call the police?

665
01:07:26,115 --> 01:07:29,049
I don't feel like talking
right now, Mike.

666
01:07:50,238 --> 01:07:53,607
What are you watching?

667
01:07:53,609 --> 01:07:56,944
The History Channel.

668
01:07:56,946 --> 01:08:00,080
Do you want to sit down?

669
01:08:00,082 --> 01:08:01,414
Sure.

670
01:08:14,361 --> 01:08:16,763
I read that how you rate your
life questionnaire my dad

671
01:08:16,765 --> 01:08:19,265
filled out.

672
01:08:19,267 --> 01:08:21,434
You did?

673
01:08:21,436 --> 01:08:23,703
Yeah.

674
01:08:23,705 --> 01:08:28,608
You know, he didn't... he didn't
rate you very high.

675
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:30,376
Yeah, I know.

676
01:08:30,378 --> 01:08:31,811
But you got a 10.

677
01:08:31,813 --> 01:08:33,880
Guess that makes you happy.

678
01:08:33,882 --> 01:08:35,448
He's full of shit.

679
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:37,717
You know that, right?

680
01:08:37,719 --> 01:08:42,889
I mean, when I needed
him, I got zero.

681
01:08:42,891 --> 01:08:47,393
And now that I don't give
a shit, I'm a 10?

682
01:08:47,395 --> 01:08:51,531
I mean, fuck him.

683
01:09:17,057 --> 01:09:22,728
Kevin His name's Kevin.

684
01:09:27,533 --> 01:09:30,302
He's 13.

685
01:09:30,304 --> 01:09:32,471
He was 6 when my wife left me.

686
01:09:36,943 --> 01:09:38,877
She said I spend more time
with the cat than

687
01:09:38,879 --> 01:09:40,379
I did with my kid.

688
01:09:46,185 --> 01:09:47,653
Golf was the excuse.

689
01:09:54,726 --> 01:09:56,434
If I'm honest,

690
01:09:59,163 --> 01:10:01,646
the reason
I stayed away was...

691
01:10:10,042 --> 01:10:14,078
You hear about that overpowering
rush of love a

692
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:17,481
parent feels for their kid?

693
01:10:17,483 --> 01:10:18,716
Well, for me, it was...

694
01:10:18,718 --> 01:10:20,151
You don't have to do this, Arthur.

695
01:10:20,153 --> 01:10:21,519
I really don't need to know.

696
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:23,187
Drip, drip, drip.

697
01:10:29,361 --> 01:10:32,830
I couldn't feel the big ones.

698
01:10:32,832 --> 01:10:34,598
The stuff that runs deep,
I couldn't...

699
01:10:40,339 --> 01:10:45,388
so when you ask is there
something wrong with me, yeah.

700
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:53,350
That was then.

701
01:10:53,352 --> 01:10:55,986
Arthur, look at you now.

702
01:11:00,358 --> 01:11:02,058
Do you miss Michaela?

703
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,900
No.

704
01:11:15,339 --> 01:11:16,873
Think she misses you?

705
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:19,209
No.

706
01:11:19,211 --> 01:11:21,277
Who takes care of her?

707
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:24,547
Nurses and doctors,
professionals, whatever.

708
01:11:24,549 --> 01:11:26,349
I mean, who takes
care of her when

709
01:11:26,351 --> 01:11:29,019
she's not in the hospital?

710
01:11:29,021 --> 01:11:30,787
She's a grown woman.

711
01:11:30,789 --> 01:11:32,188
She can take care of herself.

712
01:11:34,825 --> 01:11:37,927
So it's obviously not you.

713
01:11:37,929 --> 01:11:39,329
Me?

714
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:45,868
How am I supposed to take
care of a lunatic?

715
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:46,902
Look at me.

716
01:11:46,904 --> 01:11:48,771
Practically certifiable myself.

717
01:11:48,773 --> 01:11:50,172
Just look at me.

718
01:11:53,209 --> 01:11:54,877
I'm looking at your back.

719
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:08,190
It's just an act, isn't it?

720
01:12:08,192 --> 01:12:11,126
To avoid responsibility?

721
01:12:11,128 --> 01:12:14,997
For yourself, for your sister.

722
01:12:14,999 --> 01:12:18,700
For all the selfish things you do.

723
01:12:18,702 --> 01:12:20,669
Shut the fuck up.

724
01:12:25,241 --> 01:12:27,876
The elusive species that
I hope to get was

725
01:12:27,878 --> 01:12:31,513
the oceanic white tip, which is
considered the fourth most

726
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:33,148
dangerous species of shark...

727
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:36,385
I think I'm going to go to bed now.

728
01:12:36,387 --> 01:12:37,413
Of course.

729
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:39,407
- Good night.
- Good night.

730
01:12:56,406 --> 01:12:58,639
This is your wakeup call, sir.

731
01:12:58,641 --> 01:12:59,574
Checkout time is 11:00 AM.

732
01:12:59,576 --> 01:13:01,642
Thank you. -Wake up, Mike.

733
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:51,591
I won't be checking out today.

734
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:54,528
Mr. Newman?

735
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:55,428
It's the police.

736
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:56,930
Please open the door.

737
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,735
Do you know a woman named
Charlotte Fitzgerald?

738
01:14:10,077 --> 01:14:13,180
I'd just like to point out you
haven't read me my rights.

739
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:15,448
I'd like to be given the respect

740
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:17,851
due to a lawful citizen.

741
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:19,853
You're not under arrest,
Mr. Newman.

742
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:21,254
I'm not?

743
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:24,591
We just want to ask you some
questions about Miss.

744
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:26,660
Fitzgerald.

745
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:27,826
Is she...

746
01:14:27,828 --> 01:14:29,828
something happen to her?

747
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:31,230
She's in jail.

748
01:14:31,232 --> 01:14:32,598
What for?

749
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:35,234
Pick pocketing, down at the mall.

750
01:14:35,236 --> 01:14:39,104
When we arrested her, we found
$29,000 and change in her

751
01:14:39,106 --> 01:14:42,808
knapsack along with
other things.

752
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:47,179
She says it belongs to
you and she stole it.

753
01:14:47,181 --> 01:14:49,315
Points for honesty, right?

754
01:14:49,317 --> 01:14:50,716
Do you want to press charges?

755
01:14:53,253 --> 01:14:54,620
I gave her the money.

756
01:14:58,892 --> 01:15:01,860
Mr. Newman, no one gives a
perfect stranger 30 grand.

757
01:15:01,862 --> 01:15:03,062
This is not a perfect
stranger.

758
01:15:03,064 --> 01:15:05,064
I have feelings for her.

759
01:15:07,867 --> 01:15:09,802
Deep feelings, matter of fact.

760
01:15:13,074 --> 01:15:17,910
You have feelings for
a klepto, mister.

761
01:15:17,912 --> 01:15:22,647
Do you know an Owen Hadley?

762
01:15:22,649 --> 01:15:25,149
No.

763
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:26,517
How about these people?

764
01:15:30,689 --> 01:15:32,056
No.

765
01:15:34,994 --> 01:15:39,897
I don't suppose you, uh, know
Beauregard Tully, either?

766
01:15:45,204 --> 01:15:46,571
I, um...

767
01:15:49,141 --> 01:15:50,508
no.

768
01:15:54,547 --> 01:15:55,947
Excuse me.

769
01:16:15,267 --> 01:16:16,634
How much is her bail?

770
01:16:21,773 --> 01:16:23,293
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

771
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:26,376
Do you want some toast?

772
01:16:26,378 --> 01:16:28,145
Why do you wear a bra
under your nightgown?

773
01:16:31,216 --> 01:16:35,852
I have some toast, and I have,
uh, jam and honey.

774
01:16:35,854 --> 01:16:38,388
What kind of jam?

775
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:40,557
Strawberry.

776
01:16:40,559 --> 01:16:41,925
Jam, I guess.

777
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:51,134
Did you and my dad have a lot
of sex in this apartment.

778
01:16:54,105 --> 01:16:55,439
Uh, that's a personal question!

779
01:16:55,441 --> 01:16:56,373
I...

780
01:16:56,375 --> 01:17:00,844
me to answer, Kevin.

781
01:17:00,846 --> 01:17:02,279
OK.

782
01:17:02,281 --> 01:17:04,981
Well, didn't you think he
was kind of boring?

783
01:17:04,983 --> 01:17:06,917
Focus on the positive.

784
01:17:06,919 --> 01:17:08,085
You're dad was...

785
01:17:08,087 --> 01:17:09,786
Come on, Mina.

786
01:17:11,856 --> 01:17:14,256
OK, he was incredibly boring.

787
01:17:14,258 --> 01:17:15,858
I mean, the lectures.

788
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:17,226
Boring does not...

789
01:17:19,596 --> 01:17:21,063
I love him, though.

790
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,001
I love him.

791
01:17:26,003 --> 01:17:27,937
Yeah.

792
01:17:27,939 --> 01:17:30,172
It's a lot easier to love
a dead man, isn't it?

793
01:18:28,231 --> 01:18:33,968
I'm going to try and
justify what I did.

794
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:35,570
That's good.

795
01:18:36,949 --> 01:18:38,802
Neither am I.

796
01:18:41,649 --> 01:18:43,878
Broke into people's houses,

797
01:18:45,412 --> 01:18:49,975
ate their food, wore their clothes,
slept in their beds.

798
01:19:03,097 --> 01:19:07,501
But I didn't erase a man's life.

799
01:19:07,503 --> 01:19:09,570
That I didn't do.

800
01:19:12,874 --> 01:19:14,274
You take it.

801
01:19:19,214 --> 01:19:21,114
Did you even bother
to learn his name?

802
01:19:21,116 --> 01:19:24,952
Just take a look at that
stuff in there.

803
01:19:24,954 --> 01:19:26,420
It tells you a little story.

804
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:32,593
His name is Beauregard Tully.

805
01:19:32,595 --> 01:19:36,363
Lived in Newport
News, Virginia.

806
01:19:36,365 --> 01:19:40,000
He drove a truck for Walmart.

807
01:19:40,002 --> 01:19:43,303
He was diabetic, went to
Alcoholics Anonymous.

808
01:19:47,075 --> 01:19:50,744
He had two kids,
John and Matt.

809
01:19:50,746 --> 01:19:53,580
He had a wife, Rosita.

810
01:19:53,582 --> 01:19:55,747
They were married 23 years.

811
01:20:13,835 --> 01:20:16,002
You Rosita Tully?

812
01:20:16,004 --> 01:20:18,137
Yes, I am.

813
01:20:18,139 --> 01:20:20,940
This is Charlotte Fitzgerald.

814
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:24,477
We need to talk to you about
your husband, Beauregard.

815
01:21:20,299 --> 01:21:21,700
Coming in?

816
01:22:14,653 --> 01:22:18,422
You know what it's like,
don't you?

817
01:22:18,424 --> 01:22:20,024
Lose what you thought
you didn't want.

818
01:22:22,994 --> 01:22:24,995
Spend the rest your life
wanting it back.

819
01:22:30,368 --> 01:22:35,205
I need to go home and try and
let my son know I love him.

820
01:22:35,207 --> 01:22:37,841
You need to go home and see if
your sister needs your help.

821
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:52,288
Family just crushes your
heart, doesn't it?

822
01:25:38,352 --> 01:25:39,719
Bye, Wallace.

823
01:25:55,302 --> 01:25:57,704
Don't worry, I know
where to find you.
