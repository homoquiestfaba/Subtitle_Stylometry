1
00:00:57,003 --> 00:01:00,320
Oh, heck!

2
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:07,624
You lost a piece...

3
00:01:09,396 --> 00:01:12,380
I can not think!

4
00:01:15,764 --> 00:01:17,575
No excuse!

5
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:20,345
Let me concentrate!

6
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,190
Failed and dull.

7
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:31,212
So fast?

8
00:01:33,654 --> 00:01:36,592
Are we going?

9
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:00,226
- Come on...
- What?

10
00:02:00,227 --> 00:02:02,397
Come here!

11
00:02:02,398 --> 00:02:03,889
Show me.

12
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,133
What?

13
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:12,522
Show me that
you want me!

14
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,297
What do you want me to do?

15
00:02:42,508 --> 00:02:43,491
Leave it.

16
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:45,597
Michael!

17
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:50,011
Excuse me, Melody.

18
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:10,452
Go!

19
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:17,241
Melody was not very fit!

20
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:18,098
Oh yes?

21
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:24,201
Tell me what
has happened...

22
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,432
I broke up with her
today.

23
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:33,052
It was getting too serious.

24
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:34,771
You know I do not like that.

25
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:36,005
Why?

26
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:38,384
Melody is a classy girl.

27
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:40,633
Yeah...

28
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:42,826
She is gentle, thoughtful, sensitive,

29
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:45,279
the perfect house mistress!

30
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:53,479
What?

31
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,964
Are you looking for
a cowhide?

32
00:03:54,965 --> 00:03:56,001
No...

33
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,945
Something...
Anything.

34
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:02,835
-Something more.
- Like what ?

35
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:04,337
I do not know.

36
00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:07,655
I want someone who is exceptional.

37
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:25,734
Are you Michael Morgan?

38
00:04:25,735 --> 00:04:26,994
Uh... yes.

39
00:04:26,995 --> 00:04:29,855
I am an advertising agent
at E-Media in New York.

40
00:04:29,856 --> 00:04:32,076
Welcome to L.A.

41
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:35,317
Here is a wafer
that I printed

42
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:37,714
I prepared it
to introduce myself.

43
00:04:37,715 --> 00:04:39,822
Great!

44
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:44,229
- Michael Morgan
- Suzanne Braunhill

45
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,739
Nice name!

46
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,901
It means "well... rolled" in Gaelic.

47
00:04:47,902 --> 00:04:50,017
You wear it
very well.

48
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:56,426
Good. I think
we will meet again.

49
00:04:57,863 --> 00:05:00,044
Miss Braunhill!

50
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:02,922
Your keys!

51
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:08,592
Are you free,
after your job?

52
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,529
No!

53
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:15,267
I do not believe it!

54
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:17,293
This girl, she is...

55
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:18,941
uh...

56
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:20,543
you must see it!

57
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:22,347
Wait a minute,
come back to earth!

58
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:23,992
You shook his hand
and you cracked?

59
00:05:23,993 --> 00:05:27,054
No, we're just seen,
we talked together,

60
00:05:27,055 --> 00:05:28,757
but this girl,
I can tell you,

61
00:05:28,758 --> 00:05:31,060
- it is special!
- Ok, Ok...

62
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:33,275
And what is his name?

63
00:05:33,276 --> 00:05:34,717
Suzanne.

64
00:05:34,718 --> 00:05:36,278
This is uh...

65
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,310
Gaelic!
This is a Gaelic name.

66
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:40,278
"Well rolled"!

67
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,452
Braunhill...

68
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:47,020
Suzanne Braunhill.

69
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:48,783
Do you know her?

70
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:50,609
That's right, you worked
at the New York branch!

71
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,350
She only has problems, Michael.

72
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,219
Big problems.

73
00:05:54,273 --> 00:05:55,427
What do you mean?

74
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:56,996
You can believe me,
I know something.

75
00:05:56,997 --> 00:05:58,596
You have nothing to do with this girl!

76
00:05:58,597 --> 00:06:00,684
Where did she go, she dropped?

77
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,380
Listen to me, buddy,

78
00:06:07,144 --> 00:06:09,374
This is a barracuda.

79
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,432
Hello?

80
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:19,567
Terry? This is Michael.
I wake you up ?

81
00:06:19,568 --> 00:06:21,524
The devil never sleeps, Michael.

82
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:23,583
What do you want,
you move to New York?

83
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,839
No thanks, Terry!
This is a lot cheaper here!

84
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,690
I wanted to ask you questions about Suzanne Braunhill.

85
00:06:28,691 --> 00:06:30,331
Ah, that's it...

86
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:32,091
She has already done hers?

87
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,997
No, why, is
a bad ad agent?

88
00:06:33,998 --> 00:06:37,633
No, she is excellent,
but I had to fire her.

89
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:40,027
She is formidable,
is everything,

90
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:42,495
she put a lot of guys down!

91
00:06:43,017 --> 00:06:44,780
But it's only for the top?

92
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:47,325
No... no.

93
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:49,969
This is not my type.

94
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,243
She's paid a jerk.

95
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,088
We were all very happy
when she had her transfer.

96
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:57,514
She's a little too much
for you?

97
00:06:57,515 --> 00:07:00,778
- For you too, Mickey.
- You want to bet ?

98
00:07:03,554 --> 00:07:05,401
= $ 1000.

99
00:07:05,402 --> 00:07:08,297
- It works.
- OK, Mike.

100
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:13,032
Anything else?

101
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,923
Yes. Do you have a personal file?

102
00:07:15,924 --> 00:07:17,041
Yes, of course.

103
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:20,151
So, if you're sure,
can you fax me?

104
00:07:20,152 --> 00:07:23,042
This is contrary to the rules,

105
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,642
a special request must be made.

106
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:27,985
Please...

107
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:46,290

At retirement!

112
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,371
At retirement.

no criminal record and
earnings greater than 6 digits.

116
00:08:07,962 --> 00:08:10,914
I have to feel flattered or insulted?

117
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:13,387
Flattered!
Totally flattered...

118
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:20,597

00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:23,524

congratulations,

Stanford Biz...

121
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,101
Why at Stanford?

122
00:08:28,102 --> 00:08:30,843
I was training
in climbing.

123
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:34,706

00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:36,999

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,878
- bridge champion
- retired!

126
00:08:40,235 --> 00:08:41,721
At retirement.

127
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:45,225
Matching earnings
to more than six digits,

00:08:45,226 --> 00:08:48,581

00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:00,958
and women!

133
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,076
That's right,
women?

134
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:04,887
Yes.

135
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:08,796
Looks like we're all
the two of the same kind!

136
00:09:09,357 --> 00:09:10,986
Looks like...

137
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:14,600
Have you heard what I say about me?

138
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:15,760
Yes.

139
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:17,912
What did you
do to them?

140
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,003
I just love to play.

141
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,819
At home, at 7:00.

142
00:09:34,134 --> 00:09:36,085
Not bad,
this show!

143
00:09:36,813 --> 00:09:40,011
He loved me.
She hated me!

144
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:42,571
OK. Where are we going ?

145
00:09:42,572 --> 00:09:44,470
Where you want.

146
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:46,485
Where do I want?

147
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,492
No matter where.

148
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:51,362
- It's your turn.
- My turn ?

149
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:53,875
When will it be,
your turn?

150
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:55,571
You will see.

151
00:10:05,232 --> 00:10:07,055
Good evening, how are you?

152
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:10,287
Do you want a cocktail or wine before dinner?

153
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:11,594
As you wish.

154
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:14,153
Can you
serve two cocktails?

155
00:10:14,154 --> 00:10:16,384
Right away.

156
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:19,253
So...

157
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:23,413
Tell me a little
your life!

158
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:29,518
A show, a drink,
a nice talk...

159
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:33,072
what do you call
having a good time?

160
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:34,727
This is a start!

161
00:10:34,728 --> 00:10:36,181
And after?

162
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:39,321
I was thinking of a romantic walk on the beach?

163
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:41,439
Discuss as old friends,

164
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,760
and maybe share
childhood secrets?

165
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:48,159
And you will ask me
my astrological sign,

166
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,706
then we will go home,
you will serve me wine,

167
00:10:51,707 --> 00:10:55,662
and maybe spend an old record Franck Sinatra...

168
00:10:59,427 --> 00:11:01,066
It was your turn!

169
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:03,860
You could do anything you wanted!

170
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:06,265
Me... I would have done everything
what you wanted!

171
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,681
This is the first date.

172
00:11:07,936 --> 00:11:09,853
Why are you so hurried?

173
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:11,977
This is not what I meant.

174
00:11:22,275 --> 00:11:25,031
It's my turn,
now.

175
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,199
Hey... wait!

176
00:11:44,513 --> 00:11:46,734
What do you do?

177
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:07,230
Very nice place!

178
00:14:07,231 --> 00:14:09,280
I like it.

179
00:14:53,374 --> 00:14:55,223
Take me...

180
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:57,423
Show me.

181
00:15:41,337 --> 00:15:44,127
Do you have a condom?

182
00:15:44,128 --> 00:15:45,793
What?

183
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:51,174
A condom!

184
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,434
Ah... yes,
in the bathroom.

185
00:15:55,435 --> 00:15:58,116
Go get it!

186
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:29,618
Suzanne?

187
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,718
<i> Why are you so in a hurry?
This is the first date! </ I>

188
00:16:49,202 --> 00:16:50,953
Enter!

189
00:16:51,456 --> 00:16:55,010
This is the only thing I did not do last night.

190
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:56,343
Excuse me?

191
00:16:56,653 --> 00:16:59,196
You are really
a case, you know that!

192
00:16:59,197 --> 00:17:01,690
I know why you
have frightened them all!

193
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:04,868
Mr. Morgan... how can I help you?

194
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:08,755
Ah, I understand! No plans
during work, is that it?

195
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:12,979
I have research
to do before the meeting.

196
00:17:15,362 --> 00:17:19,238
So, if you do not have a query about the agency,

197
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,216
I have to go.

198
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:29,741
Hey, Nick...
Nick!

199
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:31,885
Wait for me!

200
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:33,254
Are we going to have a drink tonight?

201
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:35,948
No, thanks,
I'm too busy.

202
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:40,458
What is the problem, Nick?

203
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:42,805
Are you going out with her?

204
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:44,831
Yes... an appointment!

205
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:48,102
Do not do that, Michael.
Do not do that !

206
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:50,484
You really cracked
for her, huh ..

207
00:17:51,263 --> 00:17:54,989
She's going to make you live things that you've never experienced before.

208
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,967
She'll make you turn into jerk, use you...

209
00:17:57,968 --> 00:17:59,703
and dump you!

210
00:17:59,984 --> 00:18:02,927
I'm sorry, Nick.
Really, OK,

211
00:18:02,928 --> 00:18:05,288
but it's not going to happen to me!

212
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:07,114
I do not know
what is the worst:

213
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:09,098
the idea that she will destroy you, too

214
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:11,375
or the idea that she does not do it.

215
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,977
We need to talk about distance and precision.

216
00:18:22,276 --> 00:18:26,762
No Listen to this:
"Services and golf".

217
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,971
The Pacific specialist?

218
00:18:28,972 --> 00:18:31,531
America. That's what is sold in Japan.

219
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:34,214
American sports,
American golf.

220
00:18:34,962 --> 00:18:37,995
Have fun
with Kenzai balls.

221
00:18:37,996 --> 00:18:40,812
OK... America,
Anna?

222
00:18:40,813 --> 00:18:43,385
- I would like...
- balls!

223
00:18:45,276 --> 00:18:47,436
And what else,
our psychologist?

224
00:18:47,437 --> 00:18:49,807
Men in Japanese business.

225
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:53,414
Competition,
competitiveness.

226
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:55,129
Take the advantage!

227
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,550
Good!
This is more American!

228
00:18:57,764 --> 00:18:59,588
It's not going to touch them.

229
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:02,078
But the balls are Japanese...

230
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,909
Better yet!

231
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,052
The Japanese mastery,
and the image of America ..

232
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:09,767
Our balls are
unbreakable!

233
00:19:09,768 --> 00:19:11,236
Who has unbreakable balls?

234
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:14,327
Ah, well, our new recruit, Suzanne Braunhill,

235
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:15,987
you know everything
the world, Suzanne?

236
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,353
I think so.

237
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:21,828
Hello, Nick!

238
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:24,431
So, Michael, are you
who found this client,

239
00:19:24,432 --> 00:19:25,809
Can you briefer Suzanne?

240
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,064
They are looking for
an American box.

241
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:30,286
Why?

242
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:34,071
They are interested in
the American market.

243
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,927
For balls?

244
00:19:35,928 --> 00:19:38,565
Yes, bullets.

245
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:43,322
I think the American side

246
00:19:43,323 --> 00:19:45,682
will please them a lot.

247
00:19:45,912 --> 00:19:48,623
They are looking for something that could propel them

248
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:52,969
at the level of
competition here in the USA.

249
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:55,477
This is a big box, at home,

250
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:59,113
But here in America,

251
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:01,502
great...

252
00:20:01,806 --> 00:20:02,789
great...

253
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,137
loose the giants!

254
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:09,874
I think this idea of competition will be

255
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,737
very good for them.

256
00:20:16,943 --> 00:20:18,936
It's my turn!

257
00:20:18,937 --> 00:20:20,117
What do you mean?

258
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:23,260
That I want to take you,
just us two.

259
00:20:23,261 --> 00:20:27,182
Do not say things so horrible!

260
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:33,060
Please, let me go!

261
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,077
- Where am I?
- Right here...

262
00:20:36,078 --> 00:20:38,435
Monte!

263
00:20:50,427 --> 00:20:53,272
Take care!

264
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:59,005
And do not do the naughty.

265
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:02,513
Sir, do you
call yourself how?

266
00:21:03,342 --> 00:21:05,155
You can call me
sir.

267
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,321
Yes sir.

268
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:19,052
I want
to take off your blouse.

269
00:21:19,824 --> 00:21:22,391
S Please,
not that, sir!

270
00:21:22,392 --> 00:21:24,777
Do what I say!

271
00:21:29,296 --> 00:21:30,734
S Please, do not hurt me!

272
00:21:30,735 --> 00:21:33,863
I will not do anything to you,
if you are obedient.

273
00:21:33,864 --> 00:21:37,565
You'll be a nice girl, and take off your skirt.

274
00:21:44,196 --> 00:21:47,193
You are a good girl.

275
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:52,846
My panties too, sir?

276
00:21:53,765 --> 00:21:57,487
No
Not immediately.

277
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:02,555
Do not defend yourself!

278
00:22:02,556 --> 00:22:04,658
What should I do, sir?

279
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:07,302
I want to take a bath.

280
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:56,998
What do you do to me, sir?

281
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:59,981
We do not speak
without permission!

282
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:26,548
I can get up,
Sir?

283
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:28,216
No

284
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:31,599
But... I have a gift
for you!

285
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,657
- Can I search for it?
- Not now !

286
00:23:39,492 --> 00:23:43,763
Please, please!
It will please you!

287
00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:46,828
Agreed,
but hurry up.

288
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:50,776
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes !

289
00:23:51,215 --> 00:23:54,372
Now
counts up to 10.

290
00:23:54,373 --> 00:23:57,219
10...
Say it! 10...

291
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,067
10...

292
00:23:58,068 --> 00:24:00,257
- 9...
- 9!

293
00:24:00,258 --> 00:24:01,345
8...

294
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:05,749
2...
1...

295
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,750
0 !!!

296
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,317
No fears... The
3rd time, it's good!

297
00:24:40,356 --> 00:24:43,147
And... shit!

298
00:24:50,374 --> 00:24:52,738
- Hello?
- Suzanne?

299
00:24:52,855 --> 00:24:55,038
I need you to testify for me.

300
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,473
Who is it?

301
00:24:56,886 --> 00:24:58,287
Suzanne,

302
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,376
let me out here!

303
00:25:00,377 --> 00:25:03,000
What do I win, if I do it?

304
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:06,920
Sorry, the game is
finished today!

305
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:21,724
- Michael...
- Do not ask questions!

306
00:25:21,725 --> 00:25:23,093
No need!

307
00:25:23,094 --> 00:25:24,949
She started to manipulate you, is that it?

308
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,264
It's like a drug,
Michael, you're addict!

309
00:25:27,265 --> 00:25:28,750
Listen, I manage everything
that, agree?

310
00:25:28,751 --> 00:25:30,857
I can play his game.  Sharon wants to see you.

311
00:25:58,328 --> 00:26:00,292
Nick!

312
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:01,293
Do you have the air,
I ask for a coffee?

313
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:05,132
No, that's fine.

314
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:06,858
Have I heard that you spent the night in a cell?

315
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:12,842
Barely two hours.
The noises go fast!

316
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:16,327
They called to check your schedule.

317
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,309
In decent terms,

318
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,926
can you explain what you were doing?

319
00:26:20,927 --> 00:26:23,732
I just took a bath.

320
00:26:24,026 --> 00:26:25,353
How much time do you need to complete

321
00:26:25,354 --> 00:26:28,895
A week, I just have some research to do.

322
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:31,736


323
00:26:31,737 --> 00:26:33,586
I just got a fax from Kobe.

324
00:26:33,587 --> 00:26:36,290
He's in the plane,
he wants a quote tomorrow.

325
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:37,291
Tomorrow?

326
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,345
Where are the projects?
Images ?

327
00:26:41,187 --> 00:26:42,379
Do your research,

328
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,692
in 24h we need
a product that sells!

329
00:26:45,782 --> 00:26:48,001
Yes sir.
... Mrs !

330
00:26:48,002 --> 00:26:49,766
Do not let me fall, Michael!

331
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:51,573
OK, Sharon.

332
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:58,181
No, I told you that I needed...

333
00:26:58,182 --> 00:26:59,314
Alexei...

334
00:26:59,315 --> 00:27:01,830
I want all the team
Kenzei in my office.

335
00:27:02,358 --> 00:27:05,719
- Am I...
- Quick, Kobe is coming tomorrow!

336
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,639
Do you check that all
prices are mentioned?

337
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,146
OK,
I see with Larry.

338
00:27:13,147 --> 00:27:14,562
At what time do we see each other tomorrow?

339
00:27:14,563 --> 00:27:17,061
Early, at 9:00.

340
00:27:22,911 --> 00:27:24,725
Suzanne, can I show you something?

341
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,591
- Uh... yes!
- Thank you.

342
00:27:34,804 --> 00:27:36,027
This is Michael.

343
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:39,214
How are you? Do you need help with Kobe?

344
00:27:39,215 --> 00:27:41,731
No, Terry, I need help
about Suzanne Braunhill.

345
00:27:41,732 --> 00:27:44,169
Ah... So,

346
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,169
she's winded up,
is that it?

347
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,237
This is for the $ 1000?

348
00:27:47,238 --> 00:27:50,415
I want to know how to do it,
what is its weak point.

349
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,904
She does not have any.

350
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,770
There must be
something,

351
00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:57,285
money...
a promotion...

352
00:27:57,365 --> 00:27:59,461
She has ambition, but
she is not stupid,

353
00:27:59,462 --> 00:28:01,259
she is waiting for her turn.

354
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:03,869
A secret council?

355
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,187
She only likes the game.  Terry...

356
00:28:07,188 --> 00:28:08,444
- Do you have it...
- No. No...

357
00:28:08,445 --> 00:28:11,922
Mike... Barracudas
do not stay together.

358
00:28:12,898 --> 00:28:16,648
Uh, Terry...
I have to leave you.

359
00:28:17,105 --> 00:28:19,542
You were an ugly
girl last night.

360
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:29,817
I do not play anymore.

361
00:28:29,818 --> 00:28:32,037


362
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:34,727
Have you ever learned that you do not play the same game again?

363
00:28:34,728 --> 00:28:37,095
Everything is a game for you?

364
00:28:37,096 --> 00:28:38,943
All that is exciting.

365
00:28:38,944 --> 00:28:40,679
But that does not give you
the right to...

366
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,093
What?

367
00:28:42,094 --> 00:28:44,771
To excite more than you've been in all your life,

368
00:28:44,772 --> 00:28:46,513
that's what you wanted!

369
00:28:48,745 --> 00:28:50,809
Come on, you do not want me
anyway not

370
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,350
because we did not fuck
at our 2nd meeting!

371
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:57,565
And then, I said...

372
00:28:57,807 --> 00:29:00,400
the third time is
the good!

373
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,173
What is
the rules of the game?

374
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:40,129
For you to find out,
it's part of the game!

375
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:41,741
But they change
all the time.

376
00:29:41,742 --> 00:29:44,063
It's also part of the game.  Look at me.

377
00:29:58,446 --> 00:30:00,516
Kiss me.

378
00:30:00,517 --> 00:30:02,554
I'll tell you a rule:

379
00:30:21,138 --> 00:30:22,980
If you do not play,
you are eliminated.

380
00:30:22,981 --> 00:30:25,042


381
00:30:25,043 --> 00:30:29,215
Eliminated, like Nick.
You understood ?

382
00:30:29,216 --> 00:30:31,255
Yes leader.

383
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:39,729
Michael, Michael!
I have a great book!

384
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,382
Zen, and golf.

385
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:43,608
Ah, well, I'll take it later!

386
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:45,732
No, no, I have it here.

387
00:30:46,369 --> 00:30:49,329
By Carrie Heather.

388
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,951
Good job.

389
00:30:52,979 --> 00:30:55,045
I'll put it away,
Michael.

390
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:56,046
Thank you.

391
00:30:57,563 --> 00:31:00,239
- Thank you, Alexei.
- This is easy to read

392
00:31:00,506 --> 00:31:02,417
Pay attention.

393
00:31:09,772 --> 00:31:11,587
Where do you bring me?

394
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,295
Where are you, amens, mistress?

395
00:31:16,489 --> 00:31:19,476
Where are you, amens, mistress?

396
00:31:42,044 --> 00:31:44,986
Let me look at you.

397
00:31:49,163 --> 00:31:51,821
Not bad...

398
00:31:55,631 --> 00:31:57,580
So, Michael,

399
00:31:57,581 --> 00:32:00,697
Do you want
to make you love?

400
00:32:00,957 --> 00:32:02,410
Yes...

401
00:32:03,724 --> 00:32:05,169
What?

402
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:08,241
Yes, mistress.

403
00:32:08,242 --> 00:32:10,347
Good boy.

404
00:32:10,664 --> 00:32:13,231
Stay calm.

405
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:17,175
Remove that smile
from your face.

406
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:02,301
Mistress...

407
00:33:02,302 --> 00:33:03,502
What?

408
00:33:05,768 --> 00:33:09,107
I have to go to the bathroom.

409
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:12,002
Come on.

410
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,166
Go!

411
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:19,153
I can not!

412
00:33:22,271 --> 00:33:24,360
No apologies!

413
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:27,040
I'm so excited!

414
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:32,271
Why?

415
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:40,322
Good boy.

416
00:34:05,024 --> 00:34:07,824
Are you ready,
to take me?

417
00:34:15,301 --> 00:34:18,640
Close your eyes.

418
00:34:34,191 --> 00:34:36,146
Where are you going?

419
00:34:36,147 --> 00:34:37,869
A plus.

420
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,840
But I have work!

421
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:41,222
No, not today!

422
00:34:41,223 --> 00:34:42,505
Suzanne!

423
00:34:42,506 --> 00:34:45,491
If you shout loud enough,
someone can help you.

424
00:34:45,492 --> 00:34:47,463
If that's what you want.

425
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:54,941
Shit!

426
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,958
OK.

427
00:34:57,183 --> 00:34:59,228
The golfer hits
the golf ball.

428
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:02,166
The course changes to
baseball field,

429
00:35:02,525 --> 00:35:04,485
The ball flies
over the stands,

430
00:35:04,486 --> 00:35:05,720
and disappears.

431
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:08,177
Type a "home run" with
Kenzei golf balls.

432
00:35:08,435 --> 00:35:10,181
OK, good!

433
00:35:10,182 --> 00:35:11,988
Where is Michael?

434
00:35:11,989 --> 00:35:14,154
He should not be here?

435
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:16,480
Ah... yes!
I'm sorry,

436
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,956
I forgot to tell you, he did not feel well.

437
00:35:18,957 --> 00:35:21,339
Oh... he must be in bed.

438
00:35:31,636 --> 00:35:33,845
Leave him, Suzanne.

439
00:35:33,846 --> 00:35:35,688
Give up,

440
00:35:35,689 --> 00:35:39,019
stop tormenting him!

441
00:35:41,524 --> 00:35:44,386
I will play with you.

442
00:35:47,193 --> 00:35:50,431
This good Nick...

443
00:35:54,401 --> 00:35:56,798
You know Michael is...

444
00:35:56,799 --> 00:35:59,467
twice as much player
as you?

445
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:10,575
I think he's going to get there.

446
00:36:20,863 --> 00:36:22,062
I missed you?

447
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:24,216
- Slut...
- Oh!

448
00:36:24,217 --> 00:36:27,028
Oh! This is bad!

449
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:30,481
You must've felt
dropped, huh?

450
00:36:32,216 --> 00:36:35,744
We continue the game?

451
00:36:35,745 --> 00:36:39,204
I guarantee you that you will love him, this one.

452
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:49,577
- Are you thirsty?
- Yes mistress.

453
00:37:17,373 --> 00:37:19,337
Would you do anything for me?

454
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:22,729
I will play all your games, mistress.

455
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,103
You were great!

456
00:38:06,104 --> 00:38:09,234
Do not worry, we never play the same game again.  OK. Have all the documents been prepared?

457
00:38:09,235 --> 00:38:12,044
- Oh no!
- No ?

458
00:38:12,045 --> 00:38:14,089
Of course!

459
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,236
Suzanne,

460
00:38:17,134 --> 00:38:18,290
the room is ready?

461
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:20,461
Yes, it is done.

462
00:38:20,462 --> 00:38:21,936
Michael, did you read
the book?

463
00:38:21,937 --> 00:38:24,295
Which book?

464
00:38:24,296 --> 00:38:25,155
- Zen in Golf.
- Zen in golf!

465
00:38:25,156 --> 00:38:27,095
This is a great book,
Alexei. Thank you.

466
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,824
Michael?

467
00:38:29,825 --> 00:38:31,001
These ideas are commonplace.
This is too...

468
00:38:31,002 --> 00:38:33,897
Stick to that,
Miss Braunhill.

469
00:38:33,898 --> 00:38:36,726
The chips! Kobe loves
onion chips!

470
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,146
We are busy...

471
00:38:41,147 --> 00:38:43,111
Michael,

472
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,617
we are ready!

473
00:38:44,618 --> 00:38:46,709
OK.

474
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,831
I leave for the airport.

475
00:38:47,832 --> 00:38:49,967


476
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:53,158
- I'm coming with you.
- Me too.

477
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:03,534
What's hot!

478
00:39:15,861 --> 00:39:18,044
Are you hot?

479
00:39:18,045 --> 00:39:20,870
Yes, yes.

480
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:39,054
It's better...

481
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,734
What, Nick?

482
00:39:48,735 --> 00:39:51,350
Where do you look?

483
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:57,566
Do you want me?

484
00:39:58,246 --> 00:40:00,242
Suzanne...

485
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,982
Do not you want to share me, Michael?

486
00:40:13,365 --> 00:40:16,074
Nick did not want to.

487
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:20,964
C & rsquo; was a little pig.

488
00:40:24,428 --> 00:40:27,287
That's why
you lost me.

489
00:40:27,795 --> 00:40:29,226
But...

490
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,791
You like to share me,
right, Michael?

491
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,620
Species of... slut!

492
00:40:37,621 --> 00:40:41,268
You are only a slut,
without any feeling!

493
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,730
Nick!

494
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:45,719
What is your problem?

495
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,563
Stop it!

496
00:40:51,002 --> 00:40:53,834
My hero!

497
00:40:53,835 --> 00:40:56,437
I think
I'm in love...

498
00:41:09,979 --> 00:41:13,171
See you this afternoon, around 3:00 am, Mr. Kobe?

499
00:41:13,172 --> 00:41:15,867
Will you also attend the
presentation, Miss Braunhill?

500
00:41:15,868 --> 00:41:18,216
Yes, but Mr Morgan
is the manager.

501
00:41:18,217 --> 00:41:20,355
I am only his slave!

502
00:41:20,356 --> 00:41:22,789
Do you need something
, Mr. Kobe?

503
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,799
Can someone help me to record?

504
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,732
Yes, of course.
Okay, Nick?

505
00:41:27,733 --> 00:41:30,564
With pleasure.
This way, Mr. Kobe.

506
00:41:30,565 --> 00:41:32,451
- Sayonara.
- Sayonara

507
00:41:32,452 --> 00:41:35,144
- Sayonara, Mr Kobe
- Sayonara.

508
00:41:37,658 --> 00:41:39,608
Sayonara.

509
00:41:42,652 --> 00:41:45,299
<i> I'm only his slave... </ i>

510
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,801
I thought Nick would die!

511
00:41:47,802 --> 00:41:49,265
You were cow
with him.

512
00:41:49,266 --> 00:41:51,956
This was to amuse me.

513
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,325
Kobe is here?

514
00:41:55,326 --> 00:41:57,353
We negotiate tomorrow?

515
00:41:58,223 --> 00:41:59,915
That tells you, to wear luck?

516
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:01,343
What, now?

517
00:42:01,344 --> 00:42:03,370
Yes...

518
00:42:38,582 --> 00:42:40,558
- Yes?
- Hello, driver.

519
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,698
- Hello, how are you?
- Good and you ?

520
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:44,700
- Good, very good.
- What is your name ?

521
00:42:44,701 --> 00:42:46,710
Claudio.
Claudio Cabrero.

522
00:42:46,711 --> 00:42:49,281
Ah, did you hear, honey?

523
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,349
C & is a foreign name?

524
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,197
- Yes, it's Mexican.
- Mexican?

525
00:42:55,518 --> 00:42:57,850
This is Mexican, darling.

526
00:42:58,917 --> 00:43:00,919
Do you have family,
children?

527
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,757
Yes I have two children,
a girl, a boy,

528
00:43:03,758 --> 00:43:06,061
my little girl
works well...

529
00:43:06,062 --> 00:43:07,379
This is great.
Where do you live ?

530
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,921
In Hollywood.

531
00:43:08,922 --> 00:43:10,196
And you like your job?

532
00:43:10,197 --> 00:43:12,188
I love my job.
This is great,

533
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,024
I see nice people.

534
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,115
Welcome to our
West antenna!

535
00:43:20,854 --> 00:43:22,490
Where is Mr. Morgan?

536
00:43:22,491 --> 00:43:25,929
In the meeting room, he
prepares everything for you.

537
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:29,988
Then I will also
make an effort.

538
00:43:30,098 --> 00:43:32,721
This is your honor, Mr. Kobe.

539
00:43:36,365 --> 00:43:37,334
They are there?

540
00:43:37,335 --> 00:43:39,711
- They arrive.
- Go get them.

541
00:43:40,045 --> 00:43:41,581
Do you like it?

542
00:43:45,813 --> 00:43:47,325
So,

543
00:43:47,326 --> 00:43:49,280
you have not spoken
of the whole week!

544
00:43:49,281 --> 00:43:51,356
I could at least
have an explanation?

545
00:43:51,758 --> 00:43:54,955
Now, uh...
We'll talk tonight.

546
00:43:54,956 --> 00:43:57,016
I have the right to be better treated from you!

547
00:43:57,017 --> 00:43:58,407
Better treated?

548
00:43:58,408 --> 00:44:01,087
We tried, it did not work. That's all!

549
00:44:01,321 --> 00:44:03,634
I'm sorry, I'm not sure when...

550
00:44:03,635 --> 00:44:04,655
i would have had.

551
00:44:04,654 --> 00:44:06,087
What did I do?

552
00:44:06,088 --> 00:44:07,755
No one has ever treated me like that before!

553
00:44:07,756 --> 00:44:10,283
This is not you,
it's me...

554
00:44:10,792 --> 00:44:12,609
This is me.

555
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:15,340
You are a great girl.

556
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,536
But you're not what I'm looking for.

557
00:44:18,537 --> 00:44:20,449
But what do you want?
I could change?

558
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:23,254
Melody, do not take it
not against you!

559
00:44:25,146 --> 00:44:27,812
You are nice, attentive,

560
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:34,687
I want you to find yourself
someone who will appreciate that.

561
00:44:42,326 --> 00:44:46,065
Mr. Kobe wanted to see where the fireworks will take place!

562
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:54,937
All right, I think
you'll love # 8.

563
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:58,520
- Kenzei...
- Mr Kobe,

564
00:44:58,521 --> 00:45:01,528
I have the impression that these ideas do not please you too much.

565
00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:02,648
Well,

566
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:04,571
I'm listening.

567
00:45:04,572 --> 00:45:08,052
What is the competition that is stressing you?

568
00:45:08,053 --> 00:45:09,642
Yes.

569
00:45:09,864 --> 00:45:12,058
After all,

570
00:45:12,654 --> 00:45:14,695
in Japan,

571
00:45:14,696 --> 00:45:17,401
no business man,

572
00:45:17,402 --> 00:45:20,346
same Keratsyo,

573
00:45:20,347 --> 00:45:23,186
would not want to go to a golf club.

574
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:24,495
This is right?

575
00:45:24,743 --> 00:45:26,968
Yes, that's right.

576
00:45:27,773 --> 00:45:30,787
Business in Japan,

577
00:45:30,788 --> 00:45:32,287
golf,

578
00:45:32,288 --> 00:45:34,123
philosophy

579
00:45:34,124 --> 00:45:36,687
are questions
of control,

580
00:45:36,956 --> 00:45:39,863
good positioning,

581
00:45:39,864 --> 00:45:42,320
clarity of mind,

582
00:45:42,535 --> 00:45:45,285
individual excellence.

583
00:45:45,802 --> 00:45:48,956
Exactly like the
Kenzei golf balls.

584
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:51,256
<i> Kenzei Golf Balls: </ i>

585
00:45:51,257 --> 00:45:55,925
<i> because golf is the ultimate game of the spirit. </ i>

586
00:46:12,732 --> 00:46:14,255
- Hi!
- Hello.

587
00:46:14,256 --> 00:46:17,675
I have a reward for
our success tonight...

588
00:46:39,656 --> 00:46:43,064
This is Steffanie,
my friend from L.A.  Happy birthday,
Mr. Morgan.

589
00:46:44,736 --> 00:46:46,874
Michael. This is not
my birthday.

590
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:49,876
When I'm done with you, you'll think so.

591
00:46:50,637 --> 00:46:54,715
Do you have any habits you want to talk to me about?

592
00:46:54,716 --> 00:46:58,371
Uh... I snore
when I sleep.

593
00:46:58,372 --> 00:47:00,672
You are not going to sleep.

594
00:47:01,389 --> 00:47:04,210
What do you say,
can we start?

595
00:47:06,715 --> 00:47:09,259


596
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,893
I feel...

597
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:13,897
you know...

598
00:47:31,835 --> 00:47:34,559
Do you join us?

599
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:40,790
I think I'll...
just watch you.

600
00:47:57,481 --> 00:47:59,944
You are beautiful, Steffanie...

601
00:47:59,945 --> 00:48:02,962
You are beautiful!

602
00:48:14,204 --> 00:48:17,516
I adore when you
kiss like that.

603
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:01,301
I will help you.

604
00:49:02,634 --> 00:49:05,511
Ah, you too...

605
00:50:00,403 --> 00:50:03,212
I made the idiot.

606
00:50:03,213 --> 00:50:05,267
What did you do?

607
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:06,653
What did I do?

608
00:50:06,654 --> 00:50:08,983
A bit of everything.

609
00:50:08,984 --> 00:50:11,998
Cocaine? Heroin?

610
00:50:12,156 --> 00:50:15,337
Like the good old days, Mike.

611
00:50:15,338 --> 00:50:17,667
This is because of Suzanne, huh?

612
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,361
I do not want
your pity...

613
00:50:21,362 --> 00:50:22,704
Nick,

614
00:50:22,705 --> 00:50:24,139
This is crazy!

615
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:26,908
How did you let a woman do this to you?

616
00:50:26,909 --> 00:50:28,808
Yeah...

617
00:50:30,715 --> 00:50:34,362
I still have a few cigarettes.

618
00:50:34,363 --> 00:50:36,322
I stopped.

619
00:50:38,462 --> 00:50:40,303
Try with Melody,
damn it!

620
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:41,941
Michael!

621
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:45,537
Stay away from
Suzanne!

622
00:50:45,538 --> 00:50:46,652
I manage.

623
00:50:46,653 --> 00:50:48,002
We can not!

624
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,740
I do not want to!

625
00:50:49,741 --> 00:50:52,997
I do not want you to make her happy!

626
00:50:54,643 --> 00:50:57,475
I'm sorry, Nick.
Sorry...

627
00:50:59,103 --> 00:51:01,666
I like it.

628
00:51:02,923 --> 00:51:06,150
You are sick...

629
00:51:07,637 --> 00:51:10,508
I'm tired, Mike.

630
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,448
Mike...

631
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:26,565
We are no longer friends.

632
00:51:39,864 --> 00:51:42,873
How are you?

633
00:51:43,714 --> 00:51:45,980
Excuse me?

634
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:48,830
I said hello!

635
00:51:50,503 --> 00:51:52,041
Do we know each other?

636
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:53,413
What?

637
00:51:53,414 --> 00:51:56,098
Do we know each other?

638
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:58,689
I do not believe!

639
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:01,827
We may have been seen in a past life.

640
00:52:02,975 --> 00:52:06,455
Maybe you owed me money in a past life?

641
00:52:10,811 --> 00:52:14,246
Maybe you
was a favor?

642
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,485
How are you called?

643
00:52:18,901 --> 00:52:21,693
I do not have a name.

644
00:52:22,574 --> 00:52:25,229
Does it tell you to dance?

645
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,838
Do you know what?

646
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:49,056
I have a theory.

647
00:52:53,132 --> 00:52:56,772
I know how
men make love

648
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,550
their way of dancing.

649
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,793
Just see
Michael Jackson,

650
00:53:01,794 --> 00:53:04,543
it must be a
fucking guy!

651
00:53:21,574 --> 00:53:23,630
61...

652
00:53:23,988 --> 00:53:26,758
Very good choice!

653
00:54:31,308 --> 00:54:34,193
You've already made love
with a stranger,

654
00:54:34,194 --> 00:54:35,194
huh?

655
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,127
The instinct...

656
00:54:43,892 --> 00:54:47,131
He does not know what you want.

657
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:55,473
He could kill you.

658
00:55:02,016 --> 00:55:04,725
I could kill you.

659
00:55:46,565 --> 00:55:49,031
Hello, darling.

660
00:55:49,915 --> 00:55:51,698
Hello.

661
00:55:54,891 --> 00:55:56,893
Slavery,

662
00:55:56,894 --> 00:55:59,612
or Asian torture?

663
00:56:02,066 --> 00:56:04,127
Breakfast
near the pool.

664
00:56:12,545 --> 00:56:15,425
- Last night...
- No, chttt...

665
00:56:16,594 --> 00:56:19,460
Nobody...
nobody... me...

666
00:56:19,461 --> 00:56:22,302
It's like you're
in my brain!

667
00:56:22,303 --> 00:56:24,466
Seriously!

668
00:56:34,386 --> 00:56:38,312
Nobody has ever
played this game like this!

669
00:56:40,737 --> 00:56:44,202
No one has ever understood me.

670
00:56:47,212 --> 00:56:49,702
I love you, Michael.

671
00:56:50,075 --> 00:56:52,238
I like you.

672
00:59:23,061 --> 00:59:25,573
I love you, Michael...

673
00:59:25,574 --> 00:59:27,490
I like you.

674
00:59:28,048 --> 00:59:30,754
As I like you...

675
00:59:53,497 --> 00:59:56,181
Hey! Where are you going ?

676
00:59:56,182 --> 00:59:57,711
I'm taking
all day!

677
00:59:57,712 --> 01:00:00,348
What am I going to do without you?

678
01:00:00,349 --> 01:00:03,219
Have a drink
and wait for me!

679
01:00:19,812 --> 01:00:22,096
Slut!

680
01:00:36,787 --> 01:00:39,181
Hello, my love.

681
01:00:45,204 --> 01:00:47,312
He left?

682
01:00:47,313 --> 01:00:48,563
Who?

683
01:00:48,564 --> 01:00:50,494
Kobe.

684
01:00:50,774 --> 01:00:53,813
That's what I can do for the agency.

685
01:00:53,814 --> 01:00:56,167
But you said that
you loved me!

686
01:00:56,168 --> 01:00:57,935
What?

687
01:00:58,179 --> 01:01:01,537
What is it,
for you, fidelity?

688
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,952
What are you talking about?

689
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:07,100
I'm talking to you about what happened this morning.

690
01:01:08,556 --> 01:01:11,119
This was a game!

691
01:01:11,925 --> 01:01:13,783
A game?

692
01:01:16,114 --> 01:01:18,229
Come on, my love,

693
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:21,236
do not get angry
against me!

694
01:01:21,237 --> 01:01:24,655
You are strong!
You are really strong !

695
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:28,026
The best that I knew!

696
01:01:30,024 --> 01:01:32,433
I have a surprise
for you!

697
01:01:32,434 --> 01:01:35,022
Normally, I never replay
the same game, but

698
01:01:35,023 --> 01:01:37,080
This is not all the same thing.

699
01:01:37,543 --> 01:01:39,310
OK?

700
01:01:44,766 --> 01:01:47,724
What are your wishes, master?

701
01:01:49,803 --> 01:01:52,059
What are we going to do for the master?

702
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:53,669
Melody, why are you doing this?

703
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:55,508
To give you what you want!

704
01:01:55,509 --> 01:01:56,553
Michael!

705
01:01:56,554 --> 01:02:00,372
To please you!
I love you, Michael!

706
01:02:00,373 --> 01:02:02,041
Play the game, Michael!

707
01:02:02,042 --> 01:02:03,898
But all is not
a game!

708
01:02:03,899 --> 01:02:05,879
- Suzanne says that...
- Do you know the rules?

709
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,977
You are the rules,
or you are eliminated.

710
01:02:08,978 --> 01:02:10,273
She says that you have to...

711
01:02:10,274 --> 01:02:12,564
Can you respect
people without hurting them?

712
01:02:12,565 --> 01:02:14,403
We are all adults!

713
01:02:14,404 --> 01:02:16,520
Maybe
that you'll love me...

714
01:02:20,182 --> 01:02:22,114
I gave you

715
01:02:22,115 --> 01:02:24,883
more passion than you'll ever have,

716
01:02:24,884 --> 01:02:28,268
in your little life.

717
01:02:28,792 --> 01:02:31,541
Do not go,
Michael.

718
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:35,566
Michael, if you're going, it's over.

719
01:02:38,697 --> 01:02:41,120
Please, Michael...

720
01:02:57,087 --> 01:02:58,055
Reception...

721
01:02:58,056 --> 01:03:01,460
Nick Kelso, please.
Room 515

722
01:03:01,461 --> 01:03:04,372
I'm sorry, he does not want to be disturbed.

723
01:03:05,826 --> 01:03:07,695
Do you want to leave him a message?

724
01:03:07,696 --> 01:03:09,715
Uh... tell him

725
01:03:09,716 --> 01:03:11,752
tell him...

726
01:03:12,442 --> 01:03:14,402
Give up.

727
01:03:27,384 --> 01:03:28,942
Hello?

728
01:03:28,943 --> 01:03:30,498
Suzanne?

729
01:03:30,499 --> 01:03:32,107
I'm sorry...

730
01:03:32,562 --> 01:03:35,060
C is over, Michael.

731
01:03:35,286 --> 01:03:37,343
I just...

732
01:03:37,344 --> 01:03:41,039
I lost my pedals.
But it's better.

733
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,429
C is finished.

734
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:46,723
Do not remember me.
Who are you who wanted it?

735
01:03:46,993 --> 01:03:48,839
You can not...

736
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,797
C & is the rule of the game:

737
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:52,923
you have given up,
and you are eliminated.

738
01:03:52,924 --> 01:03:54,627
We do not play again.

739
01:03:54,628 --> 01:03:56,820
Ask Nick!

740
01:04:08,949 --> 01:04:10,830
Open!

741
01:04:16,163 --> 01:04:19,312
You can not let me fall like that!

742
01:04:26,807 --> 01:04:29,764
I called the police. In
2 minutes they will stop.

743
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:32,022
How are you!

744
01:04:32,171 --> 01:04:35,553
Always your game,
your rules, your turn!

745
01:04:35,554 --> 01:04:37,553
Because I know
what I want.

746
01:04:37,554 --> 01:04:38,947
Which is not your case.

747
01:04:38,948 --> 01:04:41,558
Suzanne, we do not play with that!

748
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:43,660
You do not have to give me lessons!

749
01:04:43,661 --> 01:04:45,617
You do it without stopping!

750
01:04:45,618 --> 01:04:47,267
Look Melody!

751
01:04:47,268 --> 01:04:49,926
- This is not the same!
- Why not ?

752
01:04:50,183 --> 01:04:52,033
<i> Both
of the same species </ i>

753
01:04:52,034 --> 01:04:53,793
It's you who said it.

754
01:04:53,794 --> 01:04:56,426
But your game
is not funny!

755
01:04:56,427 --> 01:04:58,759
But I did not want to hurt her!

756
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:03,104
- I was just looking for...
- What?

757
01:05:03,105 --> 01:05:05,517
Somewhat special?

758
01:05:05,518 --> 01:05:07,415
Someone to whom to confront you?

759
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:09,003
Yes!

760
01:05:09,182 --> 01:05:09,939
Suzanne...

761
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,887
That's exactly what I was doing!

762
01:05:11,888 --> 01:05:15,270
And I thought that
you were the good...

763
01:05:15,567 --> 01:05:17,295
and you do not have it.

764
01:05:17,296 --> 01:05:19,701
Suzanne,
do not do that!

765
01:05:19,702 --> 01:05:21,986
Michael, you had a chance.

766
01:05:23,197 --> 01:05:25,023
Please, give me
a second chance

767
01:05:25,024 --> 01:05:26,740
Go away!

768
01:05:26,741 --> 01:05:28,416
Suzanne!

769
01:05:29,672 --> 01:05:32,109
I beg you:

770
01:05:33,271 --> 01:05:34,990
I like you!

771
01:05:35,433 --> 01:05:38,335
And Melody likes you.

772
01:05:38,336 --> 01:05:40,188
So what?

773
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:42,952
Please, Suzanne...

774
01:05:43,217 --> 01:05:45,795
You are exactly
what I want!

775
01:05:46,769 --> 01:05:50,891
But you, no!

776
01:06:00,055 --> 01:06:01,693
Do not move anymore!
More than a gesture!

777
01:06:01,694 --> 01:06:02,578
Hands in the air!

778
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:04,355
He tried to rape me!

779
01:06:10,745 --> 01:06:15,916
It's 15h of jail.
You have a dirty head...

780
01:06:16,316 --> 01:06:19,709
We must keep you here
if you do not understand!

781
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:31,211
Where is Mr. Morgan?

782
01:06:31,212 --> 01:06:33,767
He has personal problems to solve.

783
01:06:33,768 --> 01:06:37,154
The poor...
And Mr. Kelso?

784
01:06:37,155 --> 01:06:39,398
Sick, I think.

785
01:06:39,399 --> 01:06:41,797
A E-Media
you work too much!

786
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:43,230
Oh no,

787
01:06:43,231 --> 01:06:46,350
I am sure that we can give you satisfaction, Mr. Kobe.

788
01:06:46,351 --> 01:06:49,094
This is already done, Miss Braunhill.

789
01:06:49,669 --> 01:06:51,526
And I'm happy to announce you...

790
01:06:51,527 --> 01:06:53,617
Suzanne is busy with your bullets, Mr. Kobe?

791
01:06:53,618 --> 01:06:56,320
I'm sure she worked on it well.

792
01:06:56,522 --> 01:06:58,467
Have you tried
to type it?

793
01:06:58,468 --> 01:07:00,302
C was good?

794
01:06:59,302 --> 01:07:00,339
Michael!

795
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:03,437
Suzanne is very dedicated,
not true, Suzanne?

796
01:07:03,438 --> 01:07:04,471
Mr. Morgan!

797
01:07:04,472 --> 01:07:07,578
Have you drunk?
This is unfortunate.

798
01:07:07,579 --> 01:07:09,135
Excuse me?

799
01:07:09,136 --> 01:07:10,431
You must know
games

800
01:07:10,432 --> 01:07:11,668
which she has never heard of!

801
01:07:11,669 --> 01:07:13,438
Michael! Get out here!

802
01:07:13,439 --> 01:07:14,588
Whatever you do,

803
01:07:14,589 --> 01:07:16,416
never enter
in his game,

804
01:07:16,417 --> 01:07:19,365
because she will know what you feel,

805
01:07:19,366 --> 01:07:21,660
and she will go further.
Not true, Suzanne?

806
01:07:21,661 --> 01:07:23,343
Michael!

807
01:07:23,344 --> 01:07:25,421
You are fired.

808
01:07:25,422 --> 01:07:28,946
I understand.
You have not drunk,

809
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:31,664
This is a heartache
of love.

810
01:07:31,665 --> 01:07:34,170
I sympathize...

811
01:07:37,583 --> 01:07:39,991
You forgot that.

812
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:54,514
McGarrett

813
01:07:54,515 --> 01:07:55,797
Terry, it's Michael.

814
01:07:55,798 --> 01:07:57,654
Morgan, you owe me $ 1000!

815
01:07:57,655 --> 01:07:59,109
I'm going to move to New York.

816
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:00,561
Useless, Michael.

817
01:08:00,562 --> 01:08:02,866
You broke
the first rule.

818
01:08:03,214 --> 01:08:05,795
You gave a dirty picture of the agency.

819
01:08:05,796 --> 01:08:07,653
Each his rules, huh!

820
01:08:07,654 --> 01:08:09,621
That's it!

821
01:08:09,622 --> 01:08:11,860
And you must follow them.

822
01:08:12,361 --> 01:08:14,965
You have to stop
personal play.

823
01:08:16,523 --> 01:08:19,024
- Okay?
- Recall later.

824
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:21,684
OK.

825
01:08:42,829 --> 01:08:43,638
Hello?

826
01:08:43,639 --> 01:08:46,314
Jerry! Hi, it's Morgan,
central office.

827
01:08:46,315 --> 01:08:48,012
How are you,
Michael?

828
01:08:48,013 --> 01:08:50,117
Well, thank you.

829
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,516
Listen,

830
01:08:51,517 --> 01:08:54,451
I need a double key very quickly.

831
01:08:54,452 --> 01:08:55,758
No problem!

832
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:58,674
Yes? Great, thank you, I'm here.

833
01:09:15,628 --> 01:09:18,201
- Hi!
- Hi...

834
01:09:19,595 --> 01:09:22,119
Me revoila...

835
01:09:23,136 --> 01:09:25,618
I wanted to apologize,

836
01:09:27,116 --> 01:09:29,865
for this story
and these fantasies.

837
01:09:32,422 --> 01:09:34,347
Excuse me.
I'm late...

838
01:09:34,348 --> 01:09:36,731
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye !

839
01:09:37,693 --> 01:09:39,863
Nothing was real,

840
01:09:40,827 --> 01:09:42,975
no one was real.

841
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:49,107
I understand.
It's okay.

842
01:09:49,594 --> 01:09:51,959
No,
I hurt you.

843
01:09:52,758 --> 01:09:55,527
You've done more harm to yourself, Michael.

844
01:09:56,166 --> 01:09:57,792
Yes.

845
01:10:00,106 --> 01:10:02,079
- I have to go.
- Goodbye...

846
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,397
Michael!

847
01:10:05,102 --> 01:10:07,035
Call me!

848
01:10:08,682 --> 01:10:10,135
OK.

849
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,584
Braunhill...

850
01:10:19,585 --> 01:10:23,567
Did you like the gift that I left for you?

851
01:10:23,568 --> 01:10:25,861
Not that with me!

852
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:42,132
Oh my god!

853
01:10:42,133 --> 01:10:44,580
Disgusting!

854
01:10:45,898 --> 01:10:48,315
Did you see Michael?

855
01:10:48,316 --> 01:10:49,859
Michael Morgan?

856
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:51,652
No, why?

857
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:55,424
I do not know,
he left,

858
01:10:55,425 --> 01:10:57,459
he was looking angry.

859
01:10:57,873 --> 01:10:59,924
It does not surprise me.

860
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:03,897
He played a dirty trick!

861
01:11:04,085 --> 01:11:07,429
Not to me. At the agency.

862
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:08,545
Yes.

863
01:11:08,546 --> 01:11:12,491
But I wanted you to know that you do not want to.

864
01:11:13,216 --> 01:11:15,904
Whether it's true or not.

865
01:11:25,969 --> 01:11:27,426
Nick was right:

866
01:11:27,427 --> 01:11:30,276
There is really no other way.

867
01:11:33,951 --> 01:11:35,673
What do you want?

868
01:11:35,674 --> 01:11:37,759
Get dressed!

869
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,349
What is
going to do?

870
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:41,004
I'll show you
something.

871
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,533
Do you remember this spa?

872
01:11:42,534 --> 01:11:43,200
Yes.

873
01:11:43,201 --> 01:11:45,010
This is the place where I said I liked you.

874
01:11:45,011 --> 01:11:46,994
And I love you, Suzanne.

875
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:48,433
Me too I like you.

876
01:11:48,434 --> 01:11:50,071
No need to lie to me!

877
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:52,799
You want to show me that
I do not deserve your love.

878
01:11:53,654 --> 01:11:56,297
I do not even deserve to live...

879
01:11:56,298 --> 01:11:57,676
Michael!

880
01:11:57,677 --> 01:11:59,856
But I'm going to take
with me.

881
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:00,717
Michael...

882
01:12:00,718 --> 01:12:02,649
Please...

883
01:12:04,009 --> 01:12:06,765
Suzanne!
Suzanne, how are you?

884
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,527
- How are you?
- Yes.

885
01:12:11,528 --> 01:12:12,509
Suzanne,

886
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:16,735
- do you like me?
- Yes...

887
01:12:22,225 --> 01:12:23,237
Shit!

888
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:26,012
Kind of sick!
Not moving !

889
01:12:26,013 --> 01:12:27,606
Where I shoot...

890
01:12:30,014 --> 01:12:32,639
- You can.
- Michael, I'll shoot!

891
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,300
So go!

892
01:12:34,301 --> 01:12:36,678
Do not force me,
Michael!

893
01:12:36,679 --> 01:12:38,349
Nick was right.

894
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:44,229
Bastard!

895
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:47,041
It was my turn!
Yeah!

896
01:12:47,042 --> 01:12:49,798
Oh, shit!
Aaaah!

897
01:12:54,477 --> 01:12:55,810
Now we are
equal!

898
01:12:55,811 --> 01:12:59,178
I said that I like to play!

899
01:13:09,717 --> 01:13:11,206
It's over, Nick.

900
01:13:11,207 --> 01:13:12,653
It never ends,
my boy.

901
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,639
I got it, Nick!

902
01:13:15,396 --> 01:13:17,956
- Did you get it?
- Well done!

903
01:13:17,957 --> 01:13:19,806
C is finished?

904
01:13:20,461 --> 01:13:22,136
Yes.

905
01:13:22,712 --> 01:13:25,132
This is never finished,
with her.

906
01:13:25,133 --> 01:13:27,425
But it's over
between you, right?

907
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:32,409
Maybe...

908
01:13:42,178 --> 01:13:43,390
Come on, come on!

909
01:13:43,391 --> 01:13:45,973
You will see...

910
01:13:46,219 --> 01:13:47,698
Go!

911
01:13:50,874 --> 01:13:52,180
Not a gesture!

912
01:13:52,181 --> 01:13:53,645
I said:
"Not a gesture"!

913
01:13:53,646 --> 01:13:55,179
He can sleep!

914
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:58,610
- What...
- Get on your knees!

915
01:13:58,611 --> 01:14:00,211
Get up and on your knees!

916
01:14:00,212 --> 01:14:01,408
This is no matter what!

917
01:14:01,409 --> 01:14:03,136
Do not you want to
break her peace?

918
01:14:03,137 --> 01:14:04,812
No, it's a game!

919
01:14:04,813 --> 01:14:07,535
- Turn around!
- This is just a joke!

920
01:14:07,536 --> 01:14:09,315
Turn around!

921
01:14:10,566 --> 01:14:13,192
The hands behind
your neck!

922
01:14:16,144 --> 01:14:17,983
I arrest you for aggression.

923
01:14:17,984 --> 01:14:19,823
What do you do?

924
01:14:24,219 --> 01:14:26,456
I...
I have rights!

925
01:14:28,181 --> 01:14:30,571
Like to rape
this woman?

926
01:14:32,744 --> 01:14:34,397
Mickey!

927
01:14:34,398 --> 01:14:35,638
I can call
Mickey, huh?

928
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:37,302
You must believe me!

929
01:14:37,303 --> 01:14:38,428
Impossible.

930
01:14:38,429 --> 01:14:39,867
Listen to me:

931
01:14:39,868 --> 01:14:41,682
You'll be okay now,

932
01:14:41,683 --> 01:14:44,564
stop bothering this woman, otherwise...

933
01:14:45,558 --> 01:14:47,634
Or I make you
blow your head!

934
01:14:47,635 --> 01:14:48,752
This is a murder!

935
01:14:48,753 --> 01:14:50,956
Shut up!

936
01:14:50,957 --> 01:14:52,583
No!

937
01:14:56,379 --> 01:14:57,948
Hit! Asshole...

938
01:14:57,949 --> 01:15:00,191
Now we are
equal!

939
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:06,772
Come, my love...

940
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,749
Mick, this is Jack,
your replacement.

941
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:13,297
He's great...

942
01:15:23,002 --> 01:15:25,163
A plus, darling!

943
01:15:25,746 --> 01:15:27,088
Rest!

944
01:15:37,389 --> 01:15:39,215
Michael!
What are you doing?

945
01:15:39,216 --> 01:15:39,975
Michael!

946
01:15:39,976 --> 01:15:41,402
C is over!

947
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:42,495
No it starts!

948
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:43,809
What do you do?

949
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:45,626
One last game!

950
01:15:49,494 --> 01:15:50,567
No!

951
01:15:50,568 --> 01:15:52,646
We will play anyway!

952
01:15:55,027 --> 01:15:56,684
I give up!

953
01:15:56,685 --> 01:15:57,978
If you give up,

954
01:15:57,979 --> 01:15:58,946
you are eliminated!

955
01:15:58,947 --> 01:16:00,070
Winner: Michael!

956
01:16:00,071 --> 01:16:01,270
Help!

957
01:16:01,271 --> 01:16:03,240
Go!

958
01:16:07,903 --> 01:16:10,100
Still?

959
01:16:24,031 --> 01:16:28,093
Do you still want to play?

960
01:16:59,354 --> 01:17:01,033
Now, tell me:

961
01:17:01,034 --> 01:17:03,322
Who won the game?

962
01:17:22,339 --> 01:17:24,614
I like you, Michael...
