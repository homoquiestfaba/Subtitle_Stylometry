Todd Margaret,

6
00:00:05,683 --> 00:00:06,116
he's a temp.

7
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,650
He has no experience

8
00:00:06,684 --> 00:00:07,550
in a national market.

9
00:00:07,585 --> 00:00:08,218
Brent Wilts: Bullshit.

10
00:00:08,252 --> 00:00:09,085
He's perfect.

11
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,586
Two weeks ago,

12
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,086
I made the mistake

13
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:10,854
of sleeping with you.

14
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,521
That mistake doesn't

15
00:00:11,555 --> 00:00:13,523
make me your girlfriend.

16
00:00:13,557 --> 00:00:14,057
What the fuck are you

17
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:15,125
doing here!

18
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:15,959
Actually I'm here

19
00:00:15,993 --> 00:00:16,860
to ask you a few questions.

20
00:00:16,894 --> 00:00:17,594
You're fired!

21
00:00:17,628 --> 00:00:18,328
Still!

22
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:19,663
Again!

23
00:00:19,697 --> 00:00:20,330
This is your boss.

24
00:00:20,364 --> 00:00:20,764
This is the chick

25
00:00:20,798 --> 00:00:22,632
you wanna bang?

26
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:23,366
Hello, I'm Hudson.

27
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:25,068
I'm from Canada.

28
00:00:25,102 --> 00:00:25,935
He's down for the weekend.

29
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,537
He's staying here.

30
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:28,038
You grew up

31
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:29,139
in Leeds?

32
00:00:29,173 --> 00:00:29,973
My dad lives in Leeds.

33
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:30,740
He lived in Leeds.

34
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:31,641
He's dead.

35
00:00:31,676 --> 00:00:32,776
My dad lived in Leeds.

36
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:33,777
Fuck.

37
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:34,944
Oh, fuck.

38
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:36,846
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:37,614
Steve Davis: Snooker.

40
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:38,415
Snooker.

41
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:39,616
Snooker!

42
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,350
Not snucker.

43
00:00:40,384 --> 00:00:44,320
Not sniker.

44
00:00:44,355 --> 00:00:45,321
You sold

45
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:46,489
all the Thunder Muscle?

46
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:47,123
Yeah, the turkish people

47
00:00:47,158 --> 00:00:47,590
from the news agency,

48
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:48,224
they came in to buy

49
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:48,725
all the Thunder Muscle

50
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,960
we have in stock.

51
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:52,062
For my best friend.

52
00:00:52,096 --> 00:00:54,798
Cash.

53
00:00:54,832 --> 00:00:55,498
I'm fairly confident

54
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:56,533
this is a forgery.

55
00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:57,457

Hello, Mr. Wilts.

68
00:01:40,077 --> 00:01:41,044
I want my money,

69
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:42,412

Yes, sir.

00:01:43,514 --> 00:01:44,080
And I'm not gonna take "no"

72
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:44,581
for an answer.

73
00:01:44,615 --> 00:01:45,648
I said "yes".

74
00:01:45,683 --> 00:01:48,384
Right.

75
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:49,686
You listen up, douchenozzle,

76
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,186
you better get it right

77
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:50,887
this time.

78
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:51,821
I want that money

79
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:52,856
or I'm gonna fuck you

80
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,190
like Mike Tyson on E!.

81
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:55,492
Yeah, okay, uh,

82
00:01:55,526 --> 00:01:57,260
I'll meet you at your hotel

83
00:01:57,294 --> 00:01:58,361
as soon as I can.

84
00:01:58,395 --> 00:01:59,596
No, fuck this place.

85
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,063
A bunch of stuck up

86
00:02:00,097 --> 00:02:01,498
frigid bitches.

87
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:02,198
Meet me at that bar

88
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:03,767
down on the corner.

89
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:05,435
Todd, tell me that you nailed

90
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:06,803
that cafe vag-Jay-Jay

91
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:08,037
last night, buddy.

92
00:02:08,072 --> 00:02:10,540
Oh, boy, did I.

93
00:02:10,574 --> 00:02:11,708
I didn't, no.

94
00:02:11,742 --> 00:02:13,476
Ah, come on, stud!

95
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:14,410
It ain't gonna happen.

96
00:02:14,445 --> 00:02:16,346
I'm clearly not her type.

97
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,714
She goes for something, uh,

98
00:02:17,748 --> 00:02:18,882
a bit more exotic,

99
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:19,949
if you catch my drift.

100
00:02:19,984 --> 00:02:20,583
Listen, man, if you wanna

101
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:21,751
plug that weeping hole,

102
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:22,585
here's what you gotta do.

103
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,486
Whatever he type is,

104
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:25,088
be her type.

105
00:02:25,122 --> 00:02:25,789
Yeah?

106
00:02:25,823 --> 00:02:26,923
Yeah, dude.

107
00:02:26,957 --> 00:02:27,891
You ju gotta look the part.

108
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:28,725
All right, yeah.

109
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,492
Look the part.

110
00:02:29,527 --> 00:02:31,795
Hello?

111
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:34,264
Mr. Wilts?

112
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:37,367
Ow!

113
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:38,635
Ow!

114
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:41,337
Jesus!

115
00:02:48,546 --> 00:02:49,946
Hello, Dave,

116
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,847
it's Todd Margaret,

117
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:52,348
your ex-boss.

118
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:53,917
Um, just wanted to let you know

119
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:54,717
that I'm going to be

120
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:55,652
calling the cops

121
00:02:55,686 --> 00:02:56,953
and having you arrested.

122
00:02:56,987 --> 00:02:58,154
I don't know how dumb

123
00:02:58,189 --> 00:02:59,756
you think I am, but, uh,

124
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,890
the fact that I feel compelled

125
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:02,625
to leave a telephone warning,

126
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,094
I think, speaks volumes.

127
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:06,996
Goodbye.

128
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:13,336
Number one, I want my money

129
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,537
or I will fuck you

130
00:03:14,572 --> 00:03:16,806
like Mike Tyson on E!.

131
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:18,942
I can't do this.

132
00:03:18,976 --> 00:03:20,210
Give me my money

133
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:20,877
or I will rip off your arm

134
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:22,178
and stuff it

135
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:23,046
down your cockhole.

136
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:23,079
Down your cockhole.

137
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:25,615
What am I doing?

138
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:27,183
Hi, Miss Plimpton.

139
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:28,451

144
00:03:31,822 --> 00:03:32,288
Do you mind taking

145
00:03:32,323 --> 00:03:34,257

146
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:34,958

coupon good for nasal spray.

148
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:38,061
Would you describe your

toilet in the following way?

150
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:40,730

Miss Plimpton?

156
00:03:47,638 --> 00:03:49,172
Oh, cheese at Christmas.

157
00:03:49,206 --> 00:03:49,706
Come on, Wilts,

158
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,306
this is pathetic!

159
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:50,840
You couldn't sell crack

160
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:51,908
to a crackwhore!

161
00:03:51,942 --> 00:03:53,576
No, I know,

162
00:03:53,611 --> 00:03:54,577
I fudged that up.

163
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:55,411
I'll say you fudged that up.

164
00:03:55,446 --> 00:03:56,045
You fuckin' fudged that up

165
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,247
real good.

166
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:58,181
You better start showing me

167
00:03:58,215 --> 00:03:59,482
something by the end of today

168
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:00,617
or I'm gonna

169
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:01,784
reach down your throat,

170
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:03,386
I'm gonna grab your balls,

171
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,787
and I'm gonna pull with vigor.

172
00:04:04,822 --> 00:04:05,588
And I'm gonna take your balls

173
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:06,256
and throw them out the window.

174
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:06,923
Then I'm gonna leave

175
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:07,857
this office, get in my car,

176
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:09,225
find the ball pile,

177
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,993
and I'm gonna run over it

178
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:10,727
back and forth

179
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:12,161
and back and forth.

180
00:04:12,196 --> 00:04:13,029
And I'm gonna get outta my car

181
00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:13,630
and I'm gonna hover

182
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:14,631
over the ball pile

183
00:04:14,665 --> 00:04:15,632
that's now been flattened.

184
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,699
I'm gonna defecate on it.

185
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:17,800
Miss Turgid,

186
00:04:17,835 --> 00:04:18,568
there's a Mr. Moundford

187
00:04:18,602 --> 00:04:19,535
on line one for you.

188
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,036
I've gotta take

189
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,937
a phone call.

190
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:22,038
Why don't you get back

191
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:23,406
to not selling things?

192
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,374
Okay?

193
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:25,008
Yes.

194
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:25,909
Okay?

195
00:04:25,943 --> 00:04:27,510
I'm turning it around.

196
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:30,113
Hey, dickbreath.

197
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:31,114
As you know, the Falcons

198
00:04:31,148 --> 00:04:32,348
did not cover the spread.

199
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,784
Payment, please.

200
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:36,786
This is Turgid.

201
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,854
Double or nothin', right?

202
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:39,055
Come on, what do you say?

203
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:40,390
Let's do it.

204
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:41,658
Brent Wilts.

205
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:43,960
He's a temp.

206
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:44,928
He has no skills

207
00:04:44,962 --> 00:04:46,329
internationally.

208
00:04:46,363 --> 00:04:47,630
Bet, right?

209
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:47,997
What do you say?

210
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:49,933
Bet, man.

211
00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:59,242
Okay.

212
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:16,092
Bon jour,

213
00:05:16,126 --> 00:05:17,860
monsieur naked.

214
00:05:17,895 --> 00:05:18,461
What was you doing last night

215
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:19,295
sneaking in

216
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:19,963
in your wet underpants?

217
00:05:19,997 --> 00:05:20,863
Pam.

218
00:05:20,898 --> 00:05:21,397
I got a good look

219
00:05:21,432 --> 00:05:22,265
at that there,

220
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:23,800
and Pam likey what she see.

221
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:24,267
What are you doing

222
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:25,335
in my bath?

223
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:26,202
How long have you been here?

224
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:26,803
Calm down!

225
00:05:26,837 --> 00:05:27,537
I told you

226
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:28,304
I couldn't use mine.

227
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:29,739
There's a spider in it.

228
00:05:29,773 --> 00:05:31,140
Is that my tooth brush?

229
00:05:31,175 --> 00:05:31,607
I thought it was

230
00:05:31,642 --> 00:05:32,842
a bit small.

231
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:34,177
Haven't you got a loofa?

232
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:35,445
Pam, you gotta go, okay?

233
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:36,746
I've gotta go which means

234
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,114
you gotta go, all right,

235
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:38,781
and-and now I gotta get

236
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:39,449
a new tooth brush.

237
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:40,383
Thanks a lot.

238
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:40,917
Might need a new razor

239
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:41,551
as well.

240
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:47,090
Why?

241
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:18,788
Got it.

242
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:19,622
Oh, sorry.

243
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:20,490
Sorry.

244
00:06:20,524 --> 00:06:21,257
Sorry.

245
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,159
Oh, God!

246
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:23,726
That's okay.

247
00:06:23,761 --> 00:06:24,961
Simple mistake.

248
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:25,395
You'll be all right,

249
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:26,829
won't you?

250
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:27,997
Thanks.

251
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:30,199
Oh, got it.

252
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:31,834
What the hell!

253
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:33,036
No!

254
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,603
Please, that was a mistake,

255
00:06:33,637 --> 00:06:34,670
too!

256
00:06:34,705 --> 00:06:35,605
That was a mistake!

257
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,306
I'm from Leeds!

258
00:06:43,614 --> 00:06:44,714
Excuse me.

259
00:06:44,748 --> 00:06:45,481
What's going on?

260
00:06:45,516 --> 00:06:46,315
Are we at war?

261
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,450
No.

262
00:06:47,484 --> 00:06:49,452
This is Remembrance Sunday,

263
00:06:49,486 --> 00:06:50,486
the day when we remember

264
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:51,921
our fallen soldiers.

265
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:53,589
Oh, Memorial Day.

266
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:55,892
No, Remembrance Sunday.

267
00:06:55,926 --> 00:06:59,128
Thank you very much.

268
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:02,231
What are these?

269
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:03,666
Oh, they're just symbolic,

270
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,337
just a way to show respect.

271
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:09,572
You know what, I'd like

272
00:07:09,606 --> 00:07:12,442
to show some respect.

273
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:16,112
Put this in here.

274
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:16,746
I'll only take

275
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,347
five pounds back.

276
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:19,582
You can keep the change.

277
00:07:19,616 --> 00:07:23,119
Why thank you, sir.

278
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:24,987
Um, this isn't

279
00:07:25,022 --> 00:07:26,489
for charity, is it?

280
00:07:26,523 --> 00:07:28,524
Yes, all the money goes

281
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,560
to help injured soldiers,

282
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:35,131
war heroes.

283
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:39,335
I'll tell ya what.

284
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:43,840
Thirty, sixty, ninety pounds.

285
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:45,808
God bless you, sir.

286
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:46,509
And I'll just take

287
00:07:46,543 --> 00:07:48,344
a little bit back

288
00:07:48,378 --> 00:07:50,413
for old time's sake, huh?

289
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:52,248
...Five.

290
00:07:52,282 --> 00:07:53,349
Okay, great.

291
00:07:53,383 --> 00:07:55,451
You enjoy.

292
00:07:56,954 --> 00:07:57,787
Now it's time

293
00:07:57,821 --> 00:08:01,290
to look the part.

294
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:09,899
Oh, hey, Alice.

295
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:11,234
I was just on my way

296
00:08:11,268 --> 00:08:12,468
to play hockey in honor

297
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:13,803
of remembering day.

298
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:14,470
Do you have any maple syrup?

299
00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:16,005
No.

300
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:17,173
No?

301
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:18,007
Oh, shoot.

302
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:18,641
Uh, mousse?

303
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:19,375
Any mousse?

304
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:20,309
No, Todd,

305
00:08:20,344 --> 00:08:21,777
I have no mousse.

306
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:22,545
I really wanted

307
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:23,513
some maple covered mousse.

308
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:24,247
All right, well,

309
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:25,681
I'll be oot and aboot.

310
00:08:25,716 --> 00:08:29,085
Oh, Canada,

311
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:34,724
to me you are the best.

312
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:36,092
Is that Todd?

313
00:08:36,126 --> 00:08:38,327
Yeah.

314
00:08:38,362 --> 00:08:39,028
Is he making fun of me

315
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:41,030
'cause I'm a Canadian?

316
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:42,465
I don't know.

317
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:45,034
Is he all right?

318
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:45,501
Yeah.

319
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:46,602
No.

320
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:47,403
He's just-- he's harmless.

321
00:08:47,437 --> 00:08:48,337
You know.

322
00:08:48,372 --> 00:08:49,505
Hey, I've got an idea.

323
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,239
Why don't I invite

324
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:51,240
some friends over tonight?

325
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:52,108
You could screen your movie.

326
00:08:52,142 --> 00:08:53,476
I could maybe digitize

327
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,178
some appetizers.

328
00:08:55,212 --> 00:08:56,212
That would be very nice.

329
00:08:56,246 --> 00:08:57,880
Okay.

330
00:08:57,915 --> 00:08:58,848
But not Todd, right?

331
00:08:58,882 --> 00:08:59,615
Oh, God, no!

332
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,986
No.

333
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:11,060
Oh, that is a lot sperm,

334
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:11,928
but it's all

335
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:12,962
for a good cause.

336
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:14,130
Uh, cranberry juice.

337
00:09:14,164 --> 00:09:15,364
And finally,

338
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,832
you think your flat stinks.

339
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:18,034
Well, here's a story from

340
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:19,702
Portland, Oregon in America.

341
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:21,103
A hundred and twelve people

342
00:09:21,138 --> 00:09:22,338
found themselves homeless

343
00:09:22,372 --> 00:09:23,239
when their entire building

344
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:24,340
was condemned after

345
00:09:24,374 --> 00:09:26,042
one tenant left over 30 cans

346
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:28,978
of tuna open in 30 degree heat

347
00:09:29,012 --> 00:09:30,246
for over six days.

348
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,347
Now apparently

349
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:32,415
this attracted various animals

350
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:33,516
which then attacked

351
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,417
and killed each other.

352
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:35,084
Really?

353
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:35,751
That's amazing.

354
00:09:35,786 --> 00:09:36,586
Yeah.

355
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,286
Apparently the smell

356
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:39,121
was visible from outer space.

357
00:09:39,156 --> 00:09:39,622
Police are looking

358
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:40,389
for this man,

359
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:41,090
the tenant responsible,

360
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:42,692
for questioning.

361
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:43,693
Well, he's certainly

362
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:46,996
caused quite a stink.

363
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,997
And now we return

364
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,298
to our coverage of

365
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,032
the Remembrance Sunday

366
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:51,767
ceremony.

367
00:09:51,802 --> 00:09:52,435
There you go, mate.

368
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:53,069
That's one pound twenty,

369
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:54,737
please.

370
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:55,838
I can't go home.

371
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:57,840
Um, is everything okay?

372
00:09:57,874 --> 00:10:01,644
I, uh, oh, my Fanny.

373
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:03,813
My building's been condemned.

374
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:04,547
The police found Fanny

375
00:10:04,581 --> 00:10:05,348
rotting in it.

376
00:10:05,382 --> 00:10:06,315
Can you turn this

377
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,250
from the news?

378
00:10:07,284 --> 00:10:07,750
Put it on anything else,

379
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:08,784
please.

380
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:09,385
Oh, well, this is gonna be

381
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:10,353
on every channel, I'm afraid.

382
00:10:10,387 --> 00:10:10,920
It's the Remembrance Sunday

383
00:10:10,954 --> 00:10:11,921
ceremony.

384
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:13,289
It's live, so.

385
00:10:13,323 --> 00:10:14,690
This is live

386
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:15,858
on every channel?

387
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:16,959
Yeah.

388
00:10:16,994 --> 00:10:19,862
Huh.

389
00:10:19,896 --> 00:10:21,297
Hey, nutbreath.

390
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:23,232
Hey there, Mr. Wilts.

391
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:24,066
What the fuck

392
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:25,034
are you wearing?

393
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:26,202
Oh, I took your advice

394
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:27,603
about being Alice's type.

395
00:10:27,638 --> 00:10:28,771
This has happened

396
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:29,905
to me before.

397
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,506
The girl I was seeing

398
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,274
in Portland had a thing

399
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:32,875
for Texans.

400
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:33,909
Why the fuck did I ask?

401
00:10:33,944 --> 00:10:35,778
What the hell is going on

402
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:36,879
on your face?

403
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:38,247
Oh, um, I was in the park

404
00:10:38,282 --> 00:10:39,882
and there was this little boy

405
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,184
and, uh, oh, man,

406
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:43,619
I saw his balls

407
00:10:43,654 --> 00:10:45,421
comin' at me, and, uh,

408
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:46,989
it has been a long time,

409
00:10:47,024 --> 00:10:47,490
and I don't have

410
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:48,724
the best control,

411
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,425
and I ended up

412
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:50,126
just splatting him

413
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,893
right in the face,

414
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:52,194
and his dad didn't

415
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:53,429
take too kindly to that.

416
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:54,363
Been there, done that.

417
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:55,865
No judgment here.

418
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:56,699
Do you have my wallet?

419
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:57,900
Yes, do you got that

420
00:10:57,934 --> 00:10:58,768
Thunder Muscle money for me?

421
00:10:58,802 --> 00:11:01,137
Not exactly.

422
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:01,971
Are you fucking kidding me?

423
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:02,705
I'm gonna rip

424
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:03,673
your fucking arms off

425
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:04,407
and shove 'em

426
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:05,207
up your cockhole,

427
00:11:05,242 --> 00:11:06,175
you stupid fuck!

428
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:06,575
Oh, no!

429
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,343
Oh, no!

430
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:07,777
I've got the money.

431
00:11:07,811 --> 00:11:08,177
I've got the money

432
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:11,113
right here.

433
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:13,249
I've got 30,000 pounds

434
00:11:13,283 --> 00:11:16,018
in this briefcase.

435
00:11:16,053 --> 00:11:18,154
All right, close enough.

436
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:18,721
No, no, wait, wait, wait,

437
00:11:18,755 --> 00:11:19,922
wait!

438
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:20,456
No, you can't-you can't

439
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,257
have it yet.

440
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,191
Fuck that.

441
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:22,992
I gotta get back to my hotel

442
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:24,060
and send this out today,

443
00:11:24,094 --> 00:11:24,927
get that fucker off my back.

444
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:25,394
No, no, you can't.

445
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:26,262
Why not?

446
00:11:26,296 --> 00:11:28,798
Because...

447
00:11:28,832 --> 00:11:30,032
It's fake.

448
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:30,766
How's that?

449
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:31,801
It's counterfeit.

450
00:11:31,835 --> 00:11:32,902
I messed up.

451
00:11:32,936 --> 00:11:36,806
I got ripped off.

452
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:42,611
You stupid motherfucker!

453
00:11:42,646 --> 00:11:44,780
You worthless piece of shit!

454
00:11:44,815 --> 00:11:45,748
Pack your shit up and go back

455
00:11:45,782 --> 00:11:47,850
to Portland right now.

456
00:11:47,884 --> 00:11:48,217
No, no, no!

457
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:48,818
I can't!

458
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:49,318
I can't go home!

459
00:11:49,353 --> 00:11:50,052
I can't go home!

460
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:50,619
You give me a briefcase

461
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:51,454
full of counterfeit money,

462
00:11:51,488 --> 00:11:52,121
you expect to keep your job?

463
00:11:52,155 --> 00:11:52,688
Oh, no!

464
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:53,823
No, sir!

465
00:11:53,857 --> 00:11:54,690
I'm sorry.

466
00:11:54,725 --> 00:11:55,157
You thought the money

467
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:55,758
is fake.

468
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:56,592
I meant the briefcase

469
00:11:56,626 --> 00:11:58,060
is fake.

470
00:11:58,095 --> 00:11:58,794
The-the, yeah, the briefcase.

471
00:11:58,829 --> 00:11:59,962
I'm so sorry.

472
00:11:59,996 --> 00:12:01,397
It's-it's fake leather.

473
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:02,698
It's, uh, uh, leatherine,

474
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:03,833
a counterfeit,

475
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:05,134
leather-like substance.

476
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:05,968
The fucking briefcase!

477
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:06,535
Yes, I'm so sorry.

478
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,503
I--

479
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:08,070
Todd, I don't give a shit

480
00:12:08,105 --> 00:12:08,371
about that!

481
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:09,438
Oh, okay!

482
00:12:09,473 --> 00:12:10,406
I didn't know.

483
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,476
I thought maybe--

484
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,143
so you're telling me

485
00:12:14,177 --> 00:12:14,744
that there's 30,000 pounds

486
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:16,078
in here, right?

487
00:12:16,113 --> 00:12:16,946
You know, minus a handful

488
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,647
of 30 pound notes.

489
00:12:18,682 --> 00:12:19,982
That is so fucking great.

490
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:20,916
Now wait, wait, wait,

491
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:22,685
Frank.

492
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:23,552
This whole briefcase scenario

493
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:25,521
has got me thinking.

494
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:26,956
Um, we should really have

495
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,224
a lawyer on retainer.

496
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:28,657
Great.

497
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:29,258
Yeah.

498
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:29,759
Great idea.

499
00:12:29,793 --> 00:12:30,659
Okay.

500
00:12:30,694 --> 00:12:31,293
Uh, yesterday I was googling

501
00:12:31,328 --> 00:12:32,695
"Young and Not Legal"

502
00:12:32,729 --> 00:12:33,963
and they look quite attractive.

503
00:12:33,997 --> 00:12:34,730
Well, you oughta try

504
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:35,698
"tight, willing, and fresh".

505
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:36,098
Where are they

506
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:36,832
based out of?

507
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:37,767
I don't know, Bangkok.

508
00:12:37,801 --> 00:12:39,735
Listen, it's crunch time.

509
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,270
Sixteen thousand more crates

510
00:12:41,304 --> 00:12:42,271
of Thunder Muscles

511
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:43,305
are being unloaded right now.

512
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,241
I know, okay!

513
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:46,108
Okay.

514
00:12:46,143 --> 00:12:47,009
Sorry.

515
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:48,577
I...

516
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:50,312
Am very excited about it.

517
00:12:50,347 --> 00:12:51,080
I was tryin' to say that

518
00:12:51,114 --> 00:12:51,614
you're doin' a good job up

519
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:52,915
'til now, Margaret.

520
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:56,786
But you need to step it up now.

521
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,354
What else you got?

522
00:12:58,388 --> 00:13:00,089
I think I figured out a way

523
00:13:00,123 --> 00:13:00,923
to get the word out

524
00:13:00,957 --> 00:13:01,957
about Thunder Muscle

525
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:04,393
to all of Britain for free.

526
00:13:04,428 --> 00:13:07,096
How is that?

527
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,599
Uh, yes, is this

528
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:11,634
the Human Resources Department

529
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:12,768
at Dynamic Integrated

530
00:13:12,803 --> 00:13:14,303
Business Solutions?

531
00:13:14,337 --> 00:13:14,870
I'd like to lodge

532
00:13:14,905 --> 00:13:15,704
a formal complaint

533
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:18,040
against Brent Wilts.

534
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:20,109
Wilts, w-I--

535
00:13:20,143 --> 00:13:21,277
No, not the telemarketer.

536
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:21,911
He's the President

537
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:22,645
of Global National.

538
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,580
The company

539
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:25,848
that owns Dynamic Solutions .

540
00:13:25,882 --> 00:13:31,153
W-I-l-t... s.

541
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:33,155
And, um...

542
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,923
Wait are you telling me

543
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:34,757
that Brent Wilts

544
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:35,391
is not the President

545
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:37,326
of Global National?

546
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,494
Global National.

547
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:39,528
Look it-look it up.

548
00:13:39,563 --> 00:13:41,430
Keep looking!

549
00:13:41,465 --> 00:13:42,832
Excuse me.

550
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:43,599
Please don't use

551
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:44,500
that tone of voice with me.

552
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:46,335
I-- you know what, um,

553
00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:47,136
what's your name.

554
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:47,736
Um, I'm gonna add your name

555
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:50,039
to the complaint list also.

556
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:51,273
Excuse me, sir.

557
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:52,608
Excuse me.

558
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:53,209
Please don't speak to me

559
00:13:53,243 --> 00:13:54,276
that way.

560
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:55,177
Kindness would be appreciated

561
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:56,278
right now, sir.

562
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:56,812
Excuse me.

563
00:13:56,847 --> 00:13:57,746
Please.

564
00:13:57,781 --> 00:13:58,848
That's-that's inappropriate.

565
00:13:58,882 --> 00:14:01,183
Stop looking at me that way.

566
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:03,152
Okay, so, yeah, Andre,

567
00:14:03,186 --> 00:14:03,886
you can get changed in there

568
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,054
if you want.

569
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:06,088
She should be here soon.

570
00:14:06,122 --> 00:14:06,589
You know the basic plot,

571
00:14:06,623 --> 00:14:07,623
right?

572
00:14:07,657 --> 00:14:08,257
I fuck her on the desk?

573
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,124
Pretty much, yeah.

574
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:11,160
Okay, cool.

575
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:20,202
Good call on the outfits.

576
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:22,304
It's all about fittin' in.

577
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:22,805
Now we gotta get some

578
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:24,006
of those tomato pins.

579
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,375
Those show double respect.

580
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:26,842
Yeah, what the fuck

581
00:14:26,877 --> 00:14:28,377
is Remembrance Day?

582
00:14:28,411 --> 00:14:29,778
It's just a day that all

583
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:31,213
of us Englanders get together

584
00:14:31,248 --> 00:14:33,516
and remember how awesome war

585
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,352
can be, and this our parade.

586
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:37,152
Are there gonna be floats?

587
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:38,587
Uh, yeah.

588
00:14:38,622 --> 00:14:38,988
Are they gonna

589
00:14:39,022 --> 00:14:39,822
have Spiderman?

590
00:14:39,856 --> 00:14:41,790
Uh, yeah,

591
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:42,958
but the English Spiderman,

592
00:14:42,993 --> 00:14:44,226
a little different.

593
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:46,762
Oh, there's some tomato pins.

594
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:47,196
I've got to get

595
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:47,830
some tomato pins.

596
00:14:47,864 --> 00:14:49,565
Sorry, mate.

597
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:57,339
You know what we should do,

598
00:14:57,374 --> 00:14:58,574
find one of these old fuckers

599
00:14:58,608 --> 00:14:59,642
with a bunch of war medals on

600
00:14:59,676 --> 00:15:00,543
and get him to drink

601
00:15:00,577 --> 00:15:03,846
this shit on camera.

602
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,680
Hey, guy, what war did you

603
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:05,848
fight in, the war on big fat,

604
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:07,416
'cause you lost.

605
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,817
Kidding, relax.

606
00:15:08,852 --> 00:15:10,019
He's Todd Margaret.

607
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:11,654
Uh, hi, um,

608
00:15:11,688 --> 00:15:12,655
I'd like to tell you

609
00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:13,822
about a great new energy drink

610
00:15:13,857 --> 00:15:15,124
called Thunder Muscle.

611
00:15:15,158 --> 00:15:17,359
Now's not the time.

612
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:18,093
It's always a good time

613
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:19,161
for Thunder Muscle.

614
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:20,729
Oh, piss off!

615
00:15:20,764 --> 00:15:22,097
Fuck this douche.

616
00:15:22,132 --> 00:15:25,501
Let's find a cripple.

617
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:31,273
Oh, this is a frickin' layup.

618
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:34,743
What are you a nurse?

619
00:15:34,778 --> 00:15:37,146
Hopefully of the wet variety.

620
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:37,780
Hey, you look like you

621
00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:38,781
could use a little get up

622
00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:42,151
and go or-or probably just go.

623
00:15:42,185 --> 00:15:42,751
This one I got

624
00:15:42,786 --> 00:15:44,053
for mass bravery.

625
00:15:44,087 --> 00:15:45,287
And this one I got

626
00:15:45,322 --> 00:15:46,822
for bringing over 1,000 women

627
00:15:46,856 --> 00:15:49,258
to a very satisfying climax.

628
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:49,925
Uh, how about a can

629
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,893
of Thunder Muscle?

630
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:52,161
Is it free?

631
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:54,630
Is it free?

632
00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:55,431
Is it-is it free?

633
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:56,165
What?

634
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:56,999
No.

635
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:58,367
Not this kid.

636
00:15:58,401 --> 00:15:59,201
What, he's a war hero.

637
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:00,269
He's not a war hero.

638
00:16:00,303 --> 00:16:01,303
It's just some kid with aids.

639
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:02,204
I don't have aids.

640
00:16:02,238 --> 00:16:03,339
Or cancer.

641
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:04,974
God!

642
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:05,708
Whatever the fuck it is,

643
00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:06,375
I don't want it associated

644
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:08,243
with Thunder Muscle.

645
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:09,178
Come on, Margaret,

646
00:16:09,212 --> 00:16:10,212
what the hell is it with you.

647
00:16:10,246 --> 00:16:10,713
You haven't impressed me

648
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:11,580
at all today.

649
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:13,549
I-I-I'm sorry.

650
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,617
I'm just-- this is all

651
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:15,718
reminding of my dad.

652
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:16,485
He used to love

653
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,753
Remembrance Day.

654
00:16:17,787 --> 00:16:18,454
He looked forward

655
00:16:18,488 --> 00:16:20,422
to marching in it every year.

656
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:22,424
He's kind of like a mascot

657
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:26,195
for them

658
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:31,433
sorry about

659
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:34,737
yelling at you before.

660
00:16:36,673 --> 00:16:37,873
Hey, check it out.

661
00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:39,274
It's your dad's old company!

662
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:40,075
Huh?

663
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,010
Leeds, right?

664
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:41,710
Yeah.

665
00:16:41,745 --> 00:16:42,645
Oh, great.

666
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,880
Hey!

667
00:16:44,914 --> 00:16:46,982
Hey, Uncle Ernie!

668
00:16:47,017 --> 00:16:49,318
Uncle Ere!

669
00:16:49,352 --> 00:16:50,019
That's not my real Uncle.

670
00:16:50,053 --> 00:16:51,887
It's just a nickname.

671
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:52,888
You gotta sell 'em

672
00:16:52,922 --> 00:16:53,589
some Thunder Muscle.

673
00:16:53,623 --> 00:16:54,123
I don't know

674
00:16:54,157 --> 00:16:54,890
if that's really--

675
00:16:54,924 --> 00:16:55,491
what are you talkin' about!

676
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:57,259
Get the fuck in there!

677
00:16:57,293 --> 00:16:57,926
But I--

678
00:16:57,961 --> 00:16:58,694
sell 'em the God damn

679
00:16:58,728 --> 00:16:59,161
Thunder Muscle!

680
00:16:59,195 --> 00:17:00,362
Come on!

681
00:17:00,397 --> 00:17:01,397
Don't be a pussy, Margaret.

682
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:03,565
Right.

683
00:17:05,235 --> 00:17:06,335
Hello, gents.

684
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,102
Don't worry.

685
00:17:07,137 --> 00:17:08,404
I'm from Leeds, meself.

686
00:17:08,438 --> 00:17:09,304
You must be thirsty

687
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,406
with all this marching, huh?

688
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,507
Piss off!

689
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,408
Well, try this great new

690
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:13,742
energy drink, Thunder Muscle.

691
00:17:13,777 --> 00:17:14,443
Oh, piss off,

692
00:17:14,477 --> 00:17:15,377
you American twat.

693
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:15,878
Well, it's all right.

694
00:17:15,912 --> 00:17:16,612
Oh, hey!

695
00:17:16,646 --> 00:17:18,981
No need to shove!

696
00:17:19,015 --> 00:17:20,616
Hey!

697
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,685
Hey!

698
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:25,421
Yes!

699
00:17:25,455 --> 00:17:26,121
Yes!

700
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:27,222
Oh!

701
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:27,923
Oh, yeah.

702
00:17:27,957 --> 00:17:29,291
Oh, yes!

703
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:31,260
Yes!

704
00:17:31,294 --> 00:17:32,861
And cut!

705
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:34,463
Okay, brilliant work, guys.

706
00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:35,431
That's another episode

707
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:36,265
of "there's a negro in my wife"

708
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:37,700
in the can.

709
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:38,701
Uh, please, help yourself

710
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:39,435
to a complimentary case

711
00:17:39,469 --> 00:17:40,536
of Thunder Muscle.

712
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,371
You guys have earned it.

713
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:43,405
Oh, great job, Svetlana.

714
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Can you tell me

715
00:17:44,474 --> 00:17:45,574
when this will be airing?

716
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:46,375
Um...

717
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:47,643
Tonight.

718
00:17:47,677 --> 00:17:48,410
May I come to the edit.

719
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:50,212
Oh, no.

720
00:17:50,246 --> 00:17:51,380
What does S.A.S stand for,

721
00:17:51,414 --> 00:17:54,016
shitty and mean!

722
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:54,483
Hey, what the hell,

723
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:55,317
Margaret?

724
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:55,818
We've been here

725
00:17:55,852 --> 00:17:56,552
two solid hours.

726
00:17:56,586 --> 00:17:58,087
You haven't sold shit!

727
00:17:58,121 --> 00:17:59,254
I think I'm beginning to see

728
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:01,156
what you're all about.

729
00:18:01,191 --> 00:18:03,225
I got it figured out.

730
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:05,060
Don't worry, I'm not angry.

731
00:18:05,095 --> 00:18:08,297
I'm in the same situation.

732
00:18:08,331 --> 00:18:09,832
I think it's time

733
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:11,900
that we fess up.

734
00:18:11,935 --> 00:18:12,634
All right, look, I mean,

735
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:13,669
you-you can't blame me.

736
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:14,670
I mean, you know,

737
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:16,205
I-I-I-I was-I was a temp.

738
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:16,772
We need to get you laid,

739
00:18:16,806 --> 00:18:18,173
right?

740
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,541
Little boy, am I right?

741
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:20,843
No.

742
00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:22,044
Two little boys?

743
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:22,945
Two little brown ones?

744
00:18:22,979 --> 00:18:23,645
A little brown

745
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,680
and a little yellow one?

746
00:18:24,714 --> 00:18:26,014
Like fuckin' a bag of M&M's.

747
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:26,648
No, no, no,

748
00:18:26,683 --> 00:18:27,883
it's not boys at all.

749
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:28,484
Oh, girls.

750
00:18:28,518 --> 00:18:29,485
It's that-it's that

751
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:30,786
Alice chick, right?

752
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,487
All right,

753
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:32,054
here's what we're gonna do.

754
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:32,888
I got a sack of rufies.

755
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:33,822
No, no, Mr. Wilts.

756
00:18:33,857 --> 00:18:36,592
It's not that.

757
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:37,893
What the fuck is it then?

758
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:38,494
'Cause all of a sudden

759
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:39,828
you can't sell shit.

760
00:18:39,863 --> 00:18:40,496
I brought you

761
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,163
all the way over here.

762
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:41,697
Do you want me to send you

763
00:18:41,731 --> 00:18:42,197
back, is that it?

764
00:18:42,232 --> 00:18:42,998
No, no, no, sir.

765
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:43,999
No, sir.

766
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:44,767
You get out there

767
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:46,001
and you sell this shit.

768
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:46,735
Okay.

769
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,169
All right?

770
00:18:47,203 --> 00:18:48,103
Yup.

771
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:48,771
Sell it, and I'll have

772
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:49,838
the God damn camera on you.

773
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:51,840
Okay.

774
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,008
Here we go.

775
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:54,476
Here we go.

776
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:59,915
Oh, man, that killed.

777
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:01,283
Don't worry, take five.

778
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:03,218
I got it.

779
00:19:04,387 --> 00:19:05,287
Hey, everybody,

780
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:06,789
I wanna introduce you

781
00:19:06,823 --> 00:19:08,590
to a brand new energy drink

782
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,259
that you are gonna love.

783
00:19:10,293 --> 00:19:11,193
It's called Thunder Muscle

784
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:13,195
and it's totally awesome!

785
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:17,266
Seriously, I just wanna try

786
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,901
to tell you about a-a great,

787
00:19:18,935 --> 00:19:21,036
new energy drink.

788
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,604
Please, if I could just get--

789
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:23,672
you guys wanna take five,

790
00:19:23,706 --> 00:19:24,706
please.

791
00:19:24,741 --> 00:19:26,141
Uh, okay.

792
00:19:26,176 --> 00:19:27,709
Thunder Muscle, oh,

793
00:19:27,744 --> 00:19:29,178
it's so good and good for you.

794
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:31,747
Wait.

795
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:33,415
Just-- can I just get

796
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:34,516
two goddamn minutes

797
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:36,919
of silence, please!

798
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:39,288
Thank you.

799
00:19:39,322 --> 00:19:40,255
Okay.

800
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:42,457
Like I was sayin',

801
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:43,592
Thunder Muscle,

802
00:19:43,626 --> 00:19:44,760
it tastes great, chalk full

803
00:19:44,794 --> 00:19:45,761
of energy and vitamins,

804
00:19:45,795 --> 00:19:46,929
and science--

805
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:48,864
can we lose the bells!

806
00:19:48,898 --> 00:19:50,232
Be quiet!

807
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:51,934
Show some respect!

808
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:52,467
Hey, shut the fuck up,

809
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:53,435
grandpa!

810
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:54,503
Listen to what he's saying!

811
00:19:54,537 --> 00:19:56,371
Jesus Christ!

812
00:19:56,406 --> 00:19:57,206
If you pussies would've had

813
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,373
some Thunder Muscle during

814
00:19:58,408 --> 00:19:59,308
the war, we wouldn't have had

815
00:19:59,342 --> 00:20:00,275
to come out and bail

816
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,777
your faggot asses out!

817
00:20:01,811 --> 00:20:03,245
Am I right?

818
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,279
No?

819
00:20:04,314 --> 00:20:08,350
Holy shit!

820
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,666
No, hey!

821
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:25,701
No, wait, wait, wait, wait!

822
00:20:25,735 --> 00:20:26,568
This is a misunderstanding!

823
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:27,970
Wait, no, I'm American!

824
00:20:28,004 --> 00:20:29,071
Mean, I grew up in Leeds.

825
00:20:29,105 --> 00:20:29,872
Church Avenue.

826
00:20:29,906 --> 00:20:30,806
But, uh,

827
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,040
drink Thunder Muscle!

828
00:20:32,075 --> 00:20:34,276
Brent, Mr. Wilts, help!

829
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,712
Anyone!

830
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,146
This morning's Remembrance

831
00:20:38,181 --> 00:20:39,982
Ceremony was interrupted

832
00:20:40,016 --> 00:20:42,084
by a mentally ill American

833
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:43,118
protesting against Britain's

834
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:44,119
alleged cowardess

835
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:46,121
in all wars, ever.

836
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:47,489
Unbelievable.

837
00:20:47,523 --> 00:20:49,758
Um...

838
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:50,893
Hudson, I'm just going

839
00:20:50,927 --> 00:20:52,194
to pop out for a bit.

840
00:20:52,228 --> 00:20:53,095
Oh, don't tell me

841
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:53,829
you're gonna leave

842
00:20:53,863 --> 00:20:55,631
because of this guy.

843
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:56,498
Well, somebody's

844
00:20:56,532 --> 00:20:57,499
gotta help him.

845
00:20:57,533 --> 00:20:58,533
Oh, Alice.

846
00:20:58,568 --> 00:20:59,301
We've only got a couple

847
00:20:59,335 --> 00:21:00,102
of hours left.

848
00:21:00,136 --> 00:21:00,903
Sorry, everybody,

849
00:21:00,937 --> 00:21:01,870
enjoy your Vietnamese,

850
00:21:01,905 --> 00:21:02,804
cafe Milan infused

851
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:03,639
torch beams.

852
00:21:03,673 --> 00:21:04,606
And Rachel,

853
00:21:04,641 --> 00:21:05,908
don't-don't eat the batteries.

854
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:07,809
They're not Kosher.

855
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:09,711
Alice.

856
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,647
Drink Thunder Muscle!

857
00:21:52,822 --> 00:21:55,123
Oh, no!

858
00:21:55,158 --> 00:21:56,792
Honey!

859
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:16,111
I just thought

860
00:22:16,145 --> 00:22:17,379
that was terrible.

861
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:17,946
The worst film

862
00:22:17,981 --> 00:22:18,947
I've ever seen.

863
00:22:18,982 --> 00:22:20,015
Worst film I've ever seen.

864
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:22,184
It's a bucket of shit.
