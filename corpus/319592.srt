1
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,365
Sharon!

2
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:31,765
She's not here.

3
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:35,839
Oh, God.
Christopher, can you see anything?

4
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,539
Sharon!

5
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:40,473
-Sharon!
-She's there.

6
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:44,844
Sharon!

7
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:48,314
Honey!

8
00:00:51,557 --> 00:00:53,184
Sharon!

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,585
Wait for Mommy!

10
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:17,610
Sharon!

11
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:25,423
Wait.

12
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,270
Sharon! Honey!

13
00:01:51,885 --> 00:01:54,877
Oh, my God. Sharon!

14
00:01:55,088 --> 00:01:56,555
Home.

15
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:11,899
Home.

16
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:13,664
No!

17
00:02:21,249 --> 00:02:23,410
-Home! Home!
-We're going home.

18
00:02:23,618 --> 00:02:25,449
Silent Hill!

19
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:28,315
-Silent Hill!
-Rose!

20
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:30,456
-Wake up.
-Hey.

21
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:33,320
-It's okay, sweetie. We're here now.
-It's okay. It's okay.

22
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:35,017
It's okay.

23
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:38,955
It's okay, baby.
We're going right home.

24
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,794
-What are we gonna do?
-We'll get there.

25
00:02:42,003 --> 00:02:44,870
We'll find a way through this.
We'll find a way.

26
00:02:45,072 --> 00:02:46,664
No.

27
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:50,472
-She said it again.
-I know.

28
00:02:52,146 --> 00:02:56,276
-Come on, baby. It's okay.
-Calm down, baby. It's okay.

29
00:02:56,484 --> 00:02:58,008
-It's okay, baby.
-We're right here.

30
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:03,622
It's okay.

31
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:06,550
It's okay.

32
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,761
It's okay, baby.

33
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,918
-Wanna see?
-Sure.

34
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:43,563
What are you doing there, pumpkin?

35
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:50,832
This is an amazing lion.
Did you do that all by yourself?

36
00:03:51,406 --> 00:03:53,738
I'm so impressed with you, honey.

37
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:05,211
Hey, you know we're going
on a special trip, don't you?

38
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:08,148
Do you know where we're going?

39
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:11,125
No?

40
00:04:11,326 --> 00:04:14,887
Honey, sometimes when you go
to sleep, you go on a little walk.

41
00:04:15,097 --> 00:04:18,328
And sometimes
you talk about a place...

42
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:21,396
...called Silent Hill.

43
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:25,337
I don't remember.

44
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:27,673
Oh, that's okay, sweetie.

45
00:04:27,877 --> 00:04:31,711
That's why we're gonna go there,
so you can remember.

46
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,851
Daddy's not coming?

47
00:04:44,894 --> 00:04:46,953
No, sweetie.
It's gonna be just you and me.

48
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,503
Hey.

49
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:30,303
Hey.

50
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:33,541
Break's over, sweetie.

51
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:36,002
You awake?

52
00:05:37,247 --> 00:05:38,942
You wanna go?

53
00:05:57,634 --> 00:06:00,159
Damn it, Rose. What's going on?

54
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:05,507
Hi, this is Rose Da Silva.

55
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:09,434
Please leave a message,
and I'll call you back.

56
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:29,292
Oh, no, Rose.

57
00:06:36,907 --> 00:06:37,874
No.

58
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,209
Honey, you're awake?

59
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:54,613
Long drive.

60
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,152
Can I ask you something, sweetie?

61
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:01,992
Why did you change your pictures?

62
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:06,190
I didn't.

63
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:08,423
-Mommy?
-You can't remember?

64
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:11,831
No. I don't like that, Mommy.

65
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:15,598
-Baby, you can't remember doing this?
-Who did that?

66
00:08:15,808 --> 00:08:18,834
-Hey, hey, baby, it's okay.
-Mommy, who did that?

67
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:21,205
It's okay, honey. Mommy's here.

68
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:24,842
Can you wait in the car for me?

69
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,484
Can I sit in front?

70
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,419
-Of course you can sit in the front.
-Okay.

71
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:46,267
Jimmy, we need
a ham and cheese on white.

72
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:47,905
Hi.

73
00:08:48,974 --> 00:08:51,636
I just wanna pay for the gas.

74
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:54,904
And can you tell me the best way
to get to Silent Hill?

75
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:58,084
I can't seem to find it on the map.

76
00:08:58,285 --> 00:09:01,743
-Why do you wanna go there?
-l-- I read about it.

77
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:04,721
Road don't go through no more.

78
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:07,620
Your card was declined.

79
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:12,555
Hey there.

80
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:17,326
-ls everything all right?
-Don't talk to strangers.

81
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:20,404
Good girl.

82
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:23,633
All right. Well, thanks for your help.

83
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:30,010
Why did you cut off the cards?

84
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:32,241
That's not gonna stop me
from taking her there.

85
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:35,387
Listen, honey,
we gotta put Sharon in a hospital.

86
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:37,883
She needs constant care,
and she needs medication.

87
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:40,791
The medication doesn't work.

88
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:43,588
She's getting worse every day.

89
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:47,458
Honey, the adoption people said
Sharon came from West Virginia...

90
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:50,202
...and Silent Hill is in West Virginia.

91
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:52,234
I'm not giving up on her, Chris.
I'm not.

92
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:54,373
Have you actually read
the websites, Rose?

93
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:57,304
Yes, Chris, I read them.

94
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,071
Just trust me on this, please?
Just trust me on this.

95
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:02,882
Listen, honey...

96
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,576
-I love Sharon every bit as much as l--
-Chris, I gotta go.

97
00:10:08,756 --> 00:10:10,451
--I love you.

98
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:14,287
-Need any help, ma'am?
-No, we're-- We're fine, thanks.

99
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:18,625
We're fine.

100
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:36,467
Are we there?

101
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:39,037
Not yet, honey.

102
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:52,359
Keep your seatbelt fastened.

103
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:55,894
Hey!

104
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:17,612
Mommy!

105
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,543
It's okay. It's just the radio.

106
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:53,949
-I'm turning it off.
-Mommy!

107
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:46,669
Sharon?

108
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:55,010
Sharon!

109
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:58,716
Somebody! Help!

110
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:00,884
Please!

111
00:14:03,694 --> 00:14:05,924
We've had an accident!

112
00:14:10,701 --> 00:14:12,635
Anybody!

113
00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:23,607
Sharon. Honey.

114
00:14:36,326 --> 00:14:37,850
Ashes.

115
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:53,562
Sharon!

116
00:15:58,777 --> 00:15:59,766
Sharon!

117
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:02,206
Wait!

118
00:16:02,715 --> 00:16:04,114
Sharon!

119
00:16:04,316 --> 00:16:05,806
Wait!

120
00:16:29,341 --> 00:16:30,638
Sharon!

121
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:36,542
Sharon?

122
00:16:43,655 --> 00:16:45,213
Honey?

123
00:17:32,972 --> 00:17:34,166
What's happening?

124
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:42,942
Mommy.

125
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,111
Sharon.

126
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:22,885
Sharon?

127
00:18:35,803 --> 00:18:37,600
Sharon?

128
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:06,431
Hello?

129
00:19:26,655 --> 00:19:27,883
Hey!

130
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,584
Wait!

131
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,315
Hey!

132
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,891
Sharon.

133
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:35,722
Sharon.

134
00:19:37,532 --> 00:19:39,124
Sharon.

135
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:55,947
No!

136
00:20:15,804 --> 00:20:17,601
Help me!

137
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:22,710
Help.

138
00:20:23,112 --> 00:20:25,580
Help me. Help.

139
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:28,477
Someone! Shit!

140
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:35,184
Get off me! Get off!

141
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:09,956
Get off! Get off!

142
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,456
Get off me!

143
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,356
No! Get off me!

144
00:21:16,132 --> 00:21:18,930
No! Get off me! Get off me!

145
00:21:35,318 --> 00:21:36,649
Get off--!

146
00:23:27,932 --> 00:23:31,698
Only the dark one opens
and closes the door to Silent Hill.

147
00:23:31,903 --> 00:23:33,461
Please.

148
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:38,273
I don't know what's happening.
Do you know what's going on here?

149
00:23:40,344 --> 00:23:42,005
My daughter.

150
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:45,210
I'm looking for my daughter.
I'm afraid that she's been hurt.

151
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:47,783
We've all lost our children.

152
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,851
Our light.

153
00:23:50,856 --> 00:23:52,824
They deceived me.

154
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:54,424
Their evil.

155
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,155
Their hate.

156
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,658
They hurt my child.

157
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:03,835
They did terrible things to her.

158
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,831
Alessa.

159
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:11,069
This is my daughter, Sharon.

160
00:24:11,276 --> 00:24:13,176
She sleepwalks,
so you have to be careful...

161
00:24:13,378 --> 00:24:18,509
...but if you see her,
please, tell her to wait for me.

162
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:21,647
Yes, she's mine.

163
00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:23,013
-lt was mine.
-It's mine.

164
00:24:23,222 --> 00:24:25,053
-It's mine.
-It's mine!

165
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:27,054
-It's mine!
-Get off me!

166
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,395
Into the fire
she swallowed their hate.

167
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:09,124
-Hi there.
-Yeah.

168
00:25:11,004 --> 00:25:14,531
Listen, my wife,
she came through here last night.

169
00:25:14,741 --> 00:25:17,437
-Maybe you saw her?
-Daughter worked night shift.

170
00:25:19,612 --> 00:25:24,709
Actually, she was heading
for this place, Silent Hill.

171
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:27,078
-How do I get there?
-You don't.

172
00:25:27,287 --> 00:25:29,255
Town's closed down
because of the coal fire...

173
00:25:29,455 --> 00:25:31,946
...still burning underground,
you know?

174
00:25:32,158 --> 00:25:34,683
Breathe enough of them fumes,
oh, bound to kill you.

175
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,220
Okay...

176
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:42,758
...where's the turnoff?

177
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:57,543
Sharon?

178
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:31,050
Come on.

179
00:26:38,225 --> 00:26:41,786
Hi, this is Chris.
Please leave a message.

180
00:26:41,995 --> 00:26:43,963
Christopher, it's me.

181
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:48,123
I'm in Silent Hill.
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

182
00:26:48,335 --> 00:26:50,599
Sharon's lost,
but I think I know where she is...

183
00:26:50,804 --> 00:26:54,069
...so I'm going to the school
to look for her.

184
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:57,771
I'm not okay, all right?
I need your help.

185
00:26:57,978 --> 00:27:01,641
Please, please, hurry.

186
00:27:04,485 --> 00:27:05,509
uck. Come on!

187
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:08,154
Ma'am, I want you to put
both hands on the wheel.

188
00:27:10,892 --> 00:27:13,326
Put both hands on the wheel.

189
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,327
Where's the little girl, ma'am?

190
00:27:17,932 --> 00:27:21,129
Please, my daughter, she's gone.
I need your help.

191
00:27:21,336 --> 00:27:23,304
-Get out of the car.
-What?

192
00:27:23,505 --> 00:27:25,029
Move it.

193
00:27:26,274 --> 00:27:27,901
Jesus, what are you doing?

194
00:27:28,109 --> 00:27:30,202
-You're under arrest.
-What?

195
00:27:30,412 --> 00:27:33,404
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

196
00:27:33,615 --> 00:27:36,379
I don't think you understand.
There's something weird going on.

197
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:38,108
My daughter, she's in danger.

198
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:40,412
If you really cared,
you wouldn't have sped off.

199
00:27:40,622 --> 00:27:42,852
Listen to me, she 's ill.
She sleepwalks.

200
00:27:43,057 --> 00:27:45,423
Just calm right down.
I'm gonna find the little girl.

201
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:50,128
Officer Bennett to base, over.

202
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,330
Base, do you copy, over?

203
00:27:54,803 --> 00:27:57,431
-Shit.
-You're bleeding.

204
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,907
Cracked my head on the road
pretty good...

205
00:28:04,112 --> 00:28:07,570
...when my bike went down.
I must have been out for a while.

206
00:28:08,016 --> 00:28:11,281
-You all right to walk?
-Sure.

207
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,113
Then it looks like we'll be
hiking back to Brahams.

208
00:28:14,322 --> 00:28:15,620
What?

209
00:28:16,892 --> 00:28:18,621
You're going back to the station.

210
00:28:18,828 --> 00:28:20,955
-Are you kidding?
-Nope.

211
00:28:21,797 --> 00:28:23,492
Have you heard
a single word I've said?

212
00:28:23,699 --> 00:28:25,257
-Yeah, I hear you.
-Have you heard...

213
00:28:25,468 --> 00:28:26,958
...a single word I've said?

214
00:28:27,903 --> 00:28:30,565
I'm sure she's at the school,
we just need to turn around....

215
00:28:30,773 --> 00:28:33,571
--Silent Hill--
--sorry--

216
00:28:33,776 --> 00:28:35,334
--Sharon--
--lost--

217
00:28:35,544 --> 00:28:41,141
--think I know where--
--going to the school to look for her--

218
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,817
I'm not okay--

219
00:28:43,018 --> 00:28:47,216
I need your-- Your help.
Please, hurry!

220
00:29:04,974 --> 00:29:07,738
Sorry, sir, this road is closed.
You'll have to turn around.

221
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:10,776
I'm looking for my wife.
She may have come through here.

222
00:29:11,647 --> 00:29:16,016
She drives a Jeep Liberty.
Silver, Ohio plates.

223
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:20,582
Sir, this man's wife
was driving the Jeep.

224
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:22,524
Bring him down.

225
00:29:22,725 --> 00:29:24,353
-Come on.
-You've seen her?

226
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:31,959
Where is she?

227
00:29:32,636 --> 00:29:35,036
Inspector Thomas Gucci.
Enjoying the weather, are you?

228
00:29:35,238 --> 00:29:37,468
For God's sake,
I'm trying to find my wife.

229
00:29:37,674 --> 00:29:38,902
I know. Hang on a second.

230
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:41,475
Now, that vehicle you were
talking about, we found it.

231
00:29:41,678 --> 00:29:43,908
It's at the end of the bridge here,
but it's empty.

232
00:29:44,114 --> 00:29:46,605
We've got no indication
anyone's come under any harm.

233
00:29:46,816 --> 00:29:48,613
-Good Christ.
-Now, you mind telling me...

234
00:29:48,818 --> 00:29:50,786
...what your wife's doing
up here, Mr...?

235
00:29:50,987 --> 00:29:53,080
-Da Silva, Chris Da Silva.
-My pleasure, Chris--

236
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,952
The faster we start looking,
the faster we're gonna find her.

237
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,627
All right, hold your horses,
hold your horses, Chris.

238
00:29:58,828 --> 00:30:00,887
I've also got a missing deputy.

239
00:30:01,097 --> 00:30:03,190
And knowing Officer Cybil Bennett
the way I do...

240
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,164
...she's probably out there looking
for your wife and daughter.

241
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:08,667
Bobby, make sure no one
comes through that barricade.

242
00:30:08,872 --> 00:30:10,772
We're gonna get our asses up
to Silent Hill.

243
00:30:10,974 --> 00:30:12,532
-Let's take a look around.
-Yes, sir.

244
00:30:12,742 --> 00:30:14,607
While Chris here tells me
what's going on.

245
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,308
She disappeared yesterday.
I spoke to her...

246
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:21,177
...when she stopped for gas
in Brahams.

247
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:24,285
Why were you coming up here
in the middle of the night?

248
00:30:24,487 --> 00:30:27,923
-I thought it would help her.
-You people. You get off the highway...

249
00:30:28,124 --> 00:30:31,754
...from whatever big city, bringing
all your sick problems with you.

250
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,862
Why aren't you listening to me?

251
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,465
We had a guy come up here
two years ago...

252
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:41,934
...snatched a little boy from a rest stop,
dropped him into a mine vent.

253
00:30:42,139 --> 00:30:43,970
I never wanna see
anything like that again.

254
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,973
Look, I don't know what
you're thinking, but you're not helping.

255
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,339
There is no way I would ever
harm my own daughter.

256
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,879
How do I even know
she is your daughter?

257
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,482
Come on.

258
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,185
What the hell?

259
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,955
Okay.

260
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,393
Now do you see
what I'm talking about?

261
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,191
Will you take these handcuffs
off me?

262
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,801
No. Get walking.

263
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,631
There's a fire-lookout tower
on the far side of Toluca Lake.

264
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,569
-lt should have a radio.
-Fuck you, you stupid cop.

265
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,076
This place is completely cut off.

266
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,348
-You have no idea what's going on.
-Hey!

267
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,644
Hey, you up there!

268
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,946
I'm a police officer!

269
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,721
What's going on?

270
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,233
What is that?

271
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:25,074
Stand back.

272
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,014
Jesus Christ, shoot it.

273
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:45,519
Stay where you are!

274
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:48,723
Stop!

275
00:34:41,648 --> 00:34:42,637
Sharon!

276
00:36:12,107 --> 00:36:13,870
Rose.

277
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:35,725
Mrs. Da Silva,
I am an officer of the law...

278
00:36:35,931 --> 00:36:37,831
...and I will take you to safety.

279
00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:40,900
Mrs. Da Silva,
I am an officer of the law...

280
00:36:41,103 --> 00:36:43,071
...and I will take you to safety.

281
00:36:43,272 --> 00:36:45,968
-Why don't you let me do that?
-Ninety percent of the time...

282
00:36:46,175 --> 00:36:47,506
...when a wife takes a run...

283
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,974
...she takes the daughter
to a place like this...

284
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:52,204
...I'd say she's damn mad
at her husband.

285
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:56,147
You like hauling skeletons
out of your family closet?

286
00:36:56,352 --> 00:36:59,788
No, not all the time, but we're
driving on top of them right now.

287
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:02,423
Coal fire's still burning
underneath.

288
00:37:02,624 --> 00:37:04,489
You see the barbershop over there?

289
00:37:04,994 --> 00:37:07,554
-Used to be my father's.
-Your father?

290
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:10,794
He's dead.

291
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,566
November '74,
when the fire caught.

292
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:17,102
They tried to evacuate this place
as quick as they could...

293
00:37:17,306 --> 00:37:20,276
...but it was hellish, people were
dying and disappearing.

294
00:37:20,477 --> 00:37:23,139
Hell, they couldn't even find
half the bodies.

295
00:37:23,346 --> 00:37:24,938
That was the end of Silent Hill.

296
00:37:25,148 --> 00:37:28,345
These were good people,
most of them.

297
00:37:28,618 --> 00:37:30,916
Some, you might say deserved it.

298
00:37:31,121 --> 00:37:32,645
A little bit.

299
00:37:48,538 --> 00:37:50,472
Sharon!

300
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:23,361
Sharon.

301
00:39:27,738 --> 00:39:29,035
Where are you hiding?

302
00:39:40,118 --> 00:39:44,612
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
Burn the witch!

303
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:48,758
Alessa Gillespie.

304
00:39:50,095 --> 00:39:51,323
Hey!

305
00:39:55,934 --> 00:39:57,094
Hey!

306
00:40:00,005 --> 00:40:01,063
Wait!

307
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,332
It's okay.

308
00:41:09,475 --> 00:41:11,534
It's gonna be okay.

309
00:41:14,814 --> 00:41:17,248
I promise I'm gonna help you.

310
00:43:07,161 --> 00:43:08,628
Come on.

311
00:43:09,163 --> 00:43:10,994
Oh, God.

312
00:43:11,366 --> 00:43:12,924
Come on.

313
00:43:18,306 --> 00:43:24,176
Help me. Oh, God.
Please, please, help me. Help--

314
00:43:26,047 --> 00:43:32,350
Help me. Please, help me.
Help me. Help me, please.

315
00:44:25,374 --> 00:44:27,365
It's happening again.

316
00:46:44,081 --> 00:46:48,450
Help me! Please! Please!

317
00:47:00,698 --> 00:47:03,223
Come on! Come on!

318
00:47:17,381 --> 00:47:19,110
Rose!

319
00:47:20,718 --> 00:47:22,447
Sharon!

320
00:47:26,223 --> 00:47:28,282
Rose!

321
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:33,582
Rose!

322
00:48:44,503 --> 00:48:46,198
Rose.

323
00:49:01,654 --> 00:49:03,884
-Rose!
-Put your mask on.

324
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:06,718
Rose, where are you?

325
00:49:12,965 --> 00:49:15,490
-I felt her.
-You what?

326
00:49:15,701 --> 00:49:17,032
Her perfume.

327
00:49:18,404 --> 00:49:19,803
-She was here.
-Who was?

328
00:49:20,005 --> 00:49:22,030
-My wife.
-She wasn't here. Put this mask on.

329
00:49:22,241 --> 00:49:25,005
-Perfume.
-Breathe. Through that mask.

330
00:49:26,512 --> 00:49:29,106
Come on, let's go.
We're gonna go this way.

331
00:49:29,315 --> 00:49:31,112
Chris, come on.

332
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,984
-She was here.
-No, no, she wasn't here.

333
00:49:35,187 --> 00:49:36,154
I know it.

334
00:49:51,938 --> 00:49:53,200
Come on.

335
00:49:53,406 --> 00:49:55,840
Come on. Let's keep looking.

336
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,930
Get off! Get off! Get off!

337
00:50:38,885 --> 00:50:40,750
Get me that pipe.

338
00:50:41,655 --> 00:50:43,885
Rose, the pipe!

339
00:50:44,925 --> 00:50:47,052
Okay. Okay.

340
00:50:48,695 --> 00:50:51,391
-I got it. I got it.
-Quick, come on!

341
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,577
Can we get out of here?

342
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,742
We're trapped.

343
00:51:11,352 --> 00:51:12,819
Last mag.

344
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,682
-That's all the bullets you got?
-Yeah.

345
00:51:18,426 --> 00:51:19,984
Thanks.

346
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:33,333
You hear that?

347
00:51:41,382 --> 00:51:43,247
That's him.

348
00:51:48,589 --> 00:51:50,580
Stay down! Stay down!

349
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:52,850
Jesus Christ.

350
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,360
Get down!

351
00:52:03,471 --> 00:52:05,064
Shit!

352
00:53:11,974 --> 00:53:12,964
What?

353
00:53:52,615 --> 00:53:53,946
What the fuck?

354
00:53:55,685 --> 00:53:56,652
What the fuck?

355
00:53:58,988 --> 00:54:01,684
You saw that, right?
That was real?

356
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,593
What the fuck is going on?

357
00:54:05,795 --> 00:54:08,491
All right, I know this is crazy. I know.

358
00:54:08,698 --> 00:54:11,098
We gotta calm right down,
because my kid is not here...

359
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,201
...and I've gotta find her
before this happens again.

360
00:54:15,004 --> 00:54:17,097
I don't even know where to start.

361
00:54:17,507 --> 00:54:19,168
I found this.

362
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:21,344
It's from a hotel.

363
00:54:21,545 --> 00:54:24,480
I don't know where it is,
but she is in this hotel.

364
00:54:25,249 --> 00:54:26,910
Hotel?

365
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:31,844
Hey.

366
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:35,749
It's gonna be okay.

367
00:54:37,494 --> 00:54:39,485
We're gonna be okay.

368
00:54:52,476 --> 00:54:54,341
Now, don't be trying
anything, all right?

369
00:54:54,545 --> 00:54:56,536
We got men up here
all night long.

370
00:54:56,747 --> 00:54:59,477
We're gonna find your wife,
we're gonna find your daughter.

371
00:54:59,683 --> 00:55:02,584
Can't have civilians
wandering around on their own.

372
00:55:03,253 --> 00:55:05,380
You're not telling me everything.

373
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:07,987
What really happened up here?

374
00:55:08,192 --> 00:55:10,490
Just let it rest in peace.

375
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:16,130
-Directory assistance.
-Toluca County Archives, please.

376
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:17,823
One moment.

377
00:55:18,168 --> 00:55:20,500
-Archives?
-Yeah, listen.

378
00:55:20,704 --> 00:55:23,298
Do you have the records there
from Silent Hill?

379
00:55:23,507 --> 00:55:26,635
-Which records, sir?
-The police records.

380
00:55:26,844 --> 00:55:29,279
Sorry, sir,
those records are confidential.

381
00:55:29,481 --> 00:55:31,642
No, no, I can't--
No, listen, l--

382
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:34,045
Sorry, sir,
I can't access that information.

383
00:55:34,252 --> 00:55:35,719
-Listen, goddamn it.
-Sir.

384
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,319
-This is an emergency.
-I can't--

385
00:55:37,522 --> 00:55:39,513
I can't help you.

386
00:55:55,773 --> 00:55:58,469
They used to say
this place was haunted.

387
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:01,203
I think they were right.

388
00:56:10,655 --> 00:56:13,249
Help! No!

389
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:15,289
-Stay away.
-Come on.

390
00:56:15,493 --> 00:56:18,394
Stay away, sinner.

391
00:56:18,596 --> 00:56:19,927
Get back!

392
00:56:20,131 --> 00:56:21,928
Hey.

393
00:56:22,133 --> 00:56:23,828
It's here.

394
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:27,865
Faith is our destroyer.
Faith has brought us doom.

395
00:56:28,072 --> 00:56:29,937
-Get back!
-Hey, hey!

396
00:56:30,141 --> 00:56:33,076
-Get back!
-Hey, stop.

397
00:56:33,278 --> 00:56:35,644
Think you of thee
who cast the first stone.

398
00:56:35,847 --> 00:56:38,180
Lambs without a shepherd,
shepherd without a flock.

399
00:56:38,884 --> 00:56:40,943
It's your sins which hold you here.

400
00:56:41,153 --> 00:56:42,711
-Stop your lies!
-Calm down.

401
00:56:42,922 --> 00:56:43,889
Calm down, it's okay.

402
00:56:44,089 --> 00:56:46,182
-We're not gonna hurt you.
-She's gone.

403
00:56:47,193 --> 00:56:48,751
What's your name?

404
00:56:49,128 --> 00:56:52,689
Anna. My name is Anna.

405
00:56:52,898 --> 00:56:54,923
What's going on here, Anna?
Who was that?

406
00:56:55,134 --> 00:56:58,194
-I've seen her before.
-Dahlia was cast out.

407
00:56:58,404 --> 00:57:00,463
Not even the darkness wants her.

408
00:57:00,673 --> 00:57:03,267
-She's lost her daughter too.
-What?

409
00:57:03,475 --> 00:57:08,811
-Sinners deserve to lose their spawn.
-What are you doing here, Anna?

410
00:57:10,616 --> 00:57:13,141
Mother needs more food.

411
00:57:13,786 --> 00:57:15,344
You mean there are
other people here?

412
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:20,458
Christabella keeps us safe.

413
00:57:20,659 --> 00:57:23,059
-Anna.
-We take refuge in the church.

414
00:57:23,629 --> 00:57:26,496
Anna, listen to me.

415
00:57:27,066 --> 00:57:29,466
I've lost my daughter.
She's all alone.

416
00:57:29,802 --> 00:57:32,464
Can you imagine how frightened
she must feel?

417
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,639
Tell me, have you seen her?

418
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,205
Do you know where she is?

419
00:57:40,012 --> 00:57:42,947
If she has faith, she might survive.

420
00:57:43,148 --> 00:57:44,115
If not....

421
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,178
I'm taking this.

422
00:57:50,523 --> 00:57:52,218
Have you seen this?

423
00:57:52,826 --> 00:57:55,056
I've seen it at the school.

424
00:57:55,662 --> 00:57:59,428
It's on all the buildings
the elders of my elders built.

425
00:57:59,633 --> 00:58:04,093
It's a symbol of our unity,
a symbol of our faith.

426
00:58:15,548 --> 00:58:17,209
Rose, look at this.

427
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:22,447
-What is it?
-Just like yours.

428
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:27,326
-Where did you find it?
-They're all over the floor.

429
00:58:41,608 --> 00:58:42,802
Rose.

430
00:58:43,576 --> 00:58:45,134
Check this out.

431
00:58:47,013 --> 00:58:51,109
-What number did you take this from?
-1 1 1.

432
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,418
We gotta go to room 1 1 1.

433
01:00:28,984 --> 01:00:30,576
Gucci.

434
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:03,141
-Directory assistance.
-Yeah.

435
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:06,345
Toluca County Orphanage, please.

436
01:01:06,555 --> 01:01:08,547
One moment, please.

437
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,758
-Yes, I have that information for you.
-Yeah.

438
01:01:13,763 --> 01:01:15,924
Can you give me that address?

439
01:01:24,774 --> 01:01:28,335
We are wandering far
from refuge here.

440
01:01:30,546 --> 01:01:33,447
Let's keep her with us.
She's all we got.

441
01:02:00,676 --> 01:02:02,303
There's no room 1 1 1.

442
01:02:02,512 --> 01:02:04,946
The first burning.

443
01:02:05,815 --> 01:02:09,307
-What is it, Anna?
-The first burning.

444
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:11,453
Before the town had a name.

445
01:02:11,654 --> 01:02:15,112
The elders of my elders
kept us pure.

446
01:02:15,691 --> 01:02:18,024
The founders of this town
were witch-hunters.

447
01:02:18,529 --> 01:02:21,020
Burning the witch
held back the darkness.

448
01:02:21,231 --> 01:02:22,858
It stopped the apocalypse.

449
01:02:28,772 --> 01:02:30,364
It's here.

450
01:02:46,757 --> 01:02:48,952
There's a room in here.

451
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:01,997
Look at this.

452
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:11,504
Here.

453
01:03:12,215 --> 01:03:13,910
Damn.

454
01:03:29,033 --> 01:03:31,228
What is this place?

455
01:03:31,436 --> 01:03:33,631
I don't know.
We're in the next building.

456
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:35,897
Some factory, maybe?

457
01:03:37,642 --> 01:03:39,769
Looks like there was a fire.

458
01:03:46,484 --> 01:03:47,883
Hey.

459
01:04:08,873 --> 01:04:10,534
Rose!

460
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,171
Who are you?

461
01:04:55,621 --> 01:04:57,384
It's okay.

462
01:04:58,624 --> 01:05:01,923
Don't be scared.
I promise I'm not gonna hurt you.

463
01:05:20,245 --> 01:05:21,906
Rose?

464
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:46,068
Okay. Come on.

465
01:05:46,272 --> 01:05:47,967
Come on.

466
01:05:52,245 --> 01:05:55,339
It's okay. Hey.

467
01:05:55,615 --> 01:05:57,048
Hey.

468
01:06:00,053 --> 01:06:01,714
It's okay.

469
01:06:08,862 --> 01:06:10,159
It's okay.

470
01:06:10,363 --> 01:06:12,524
I'm not gonna hurt you.

471
01:06:22,842 --> 01:06:24,036
Oh, my God.

472
01:06:24,711 --> 01:06:26,770
You could be her twin.

473
01:06:30,984 --> 01:06:32,975
Are you Alessa?

474
01:06:34,721 --> 01:06:36,814
Where's my Sharon?

475
01:06:37,524 --> 01:06:39,321
Look at me.

476
01:06:40,794 --> 01:06:42,762
I'm burning.

477
01:06:45,598 --> 01:06:47,088
Rose?

478
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:51,062
Rose? My God.

479
01:06:52,039 --> 01:06:54,530
-How did you get over there?
-Where is she?

480
01:06:58,913 --> 01:07:00,278
Grab onto it.

481
01:07:01,715 --> 01:07:05,276
-Now swing back around.
-Okay.

482
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:11,455
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

483
01:07:11,859 --> 01:07:13,554
What the hell
were you doing over there?

484
01:07:13,761 --> 01:07:15,251
You're gonna get yourself killed.

485
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:18,123
I think I just saw Dahlia's daughter.

486
01:07:19,834 --> 01:07:21,529
She was the one
that brought us here.

487
01:07:21,735 --> 01:07:22,997
What are you talking about?

488
01:07:23,204 --> 01:07:25,604
She was the one
that made me crash my car.

489
01:07:26,307 --> 01:07:27,501
Alessa.

490
01:07:27,708 --> 01:07:29,903
We don't say her name.

491
01:07:33,681 --> 01:07:36,206
That's the seal, isn't it, Anna?

492
01:07:37,218 --> 01:07:39,584
The symbol of your faith?

493
01:07:42,323 --> 01:07:44,518
Something terrible happened here.

494
01:07:48,762 --> 01:07:51,925
We have to leave.
We have to leave!

495
01:07:53,234 --> 01:07:55,429
-The darkness is coming!
-Let's go.

496
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:57,463
Let's go!

497
01:08:09,284 --> 01:08:11,514
The church isn't far.

498
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,620
-Run. Run!
-Rose, come on!

499
01:08:13,822 --> 01:08:15,517
Rose!

500
01:08:25,433 --> 01:08:27,060
Hurry!

501
01:08:34,242 --> 01:08:35,436
Rose.

502
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:38,135
-Come!
-We gotta go.

503
01:08:55,797 --> 01:08:57,731
-Rose, come on.
-I've seen this.

504
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:11,073
Rose, let's go!

505
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:15,776
-Cybil!
-Rose, come on.

506
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:24,726
Cybil!

507
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:27,794
You run not towards sanctuary
but from your fears.

508
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,727
Do not join the others.
They are deceivers. They are damned.

509
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:32,491
-We gotta get inside.
-No!

510
01:09:32,702 --> 01:09:34,260
They are wolves
in the skin of sheep.

511
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:37,303
They brought about their own hell.
They'll take you with them.

512
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,736
-Filth and lies!
-Hey!

513
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,341
Stop it!

514
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:45,806
Please. I've seen your daughter.
I've seen Alessa.

515
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:51,412
-It's coming!
-She's dead, isn't she?

516
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,281
Fire doesn't cleanse, it blackens.

517
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,780
-Listen to me.
-Rose, hurry!

518
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:58,217
She looks exactly like Sharon.

519
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:00,861
She brought us here, didn't she?

520
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,795
Why? What does she want?

521
01:10:07,003 --> 01:10:08,664
Evil wakes in vengeance.

522
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:11,499
Be careful what you choose.

523
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:32,951
Rose!

524
01:11:07,064 --> 01:11:08,463
Oh, God, no.

525
01:11:30,488 --> 01:11:31,819
-Witches!
-She's evil.

526
01:11:32,023 --> 01:11:33,217
Keep away the witches!

527
01:11:36,828 --> 01:11:38,762
-No.
-Send them back!

528
01:11:39,397 --> 01:11:40,796
No.

529
01:11:41,365 --> 01:11:42,832
We're lost.

530
01:11:53,111 --> 01:11:54,578
This is a sanctuary.

531
01:12:04,655 --> 01:12:08,113
Please, Christabella,
they lured my Anna.

532
01:12:08,326 --> 01:12:10,760
They gave her to the fiend.

533
01:12:11,095 --> 01:12:14,690
Eleanor, you must remember
that Anna went against our laws.

534
01:12:14,899 --> 01:12:17,595
She went alone outside
into the devil's playground.

535
01:12:19,804 --> 01:12:23,103
She was not the responsibility
of these two strangers.

536
01:12:25,076 --> 01:12:27,203
We'll deal with them later.

537
01:12:33,152 --> 01:12:35,143
Now we must pray.

538
01:12:56,108 --> 01:12:57,302
And then I saw them...

539
01:12:57,509 --> 01:13:00,910
...from whose presence
earth and heaven fled away.

540
01:13:01,346 --> 01:13:03,940
And no home was left to them.

541
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:06,242
And then I saw them...

542
01:13:06,451 --> 01:13:09,716
...from whose presence
earth and heaven fled away.

543
01:13:09,922 --> 01:13:12,618
And no home was left to them.

544
01:13:13,091 --> 01:13:15,821
And I saw the dead,
the great and the small...

545
01:13:16,028 --> 01:13:19,191
...and they were judged
according to their deeds.

546
01:13:19,398 --> 01:13:24,426
And I saw the dead,
the great and the small...

547
01:13:24,636 --> 01:13:27,833
...and they were judged
according to their deeds.

548
01:13:30,375 --> 01:13:34,744
And anyone's name not found
written in the book of life...

549
01:13:34,947 --> 01:13:38,111
...they will be thrown
into the lake of fire.

550
01:13:48,595 --> 01:13:51,462
And now I lay me down to sleep...

551
01:13:51,664 --> 01:13:54,565
...I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

552
01:13:54,767 --> 01:13:57,235
If I should die before I wake...

553
01:13:57,770 --> 01:14:01,001
...I pray the Lord my soul to take.

554
01:14:01,207 --> 01:14:03,038
Amen.

555
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:06,173
All right, girls, into bed.
Quickly, now.

556
01:14:06,379 --> 01:14:08,973
No better place to be
on a rainy night.

557
01:14:09,182 --> 01:14:12,549
In you go, Lindsey, thattagirl.
You've got your bear, that's a girl.

558
01:14:12,752 --> 01:14:15,152
No. No talking
after lights are out.

559
01:14:18,925 --> 01:14:20,859
Good night, children.

560
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:23,051
And God bless.

561
01:14:27,066 --> 01:14:29,557
I'm sorry, Sister Margaret,
this really can't wait.

562
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,267
I can't imagine why.

563
01:14:34,207 --> 01:14:36,004
Nine years ago...

564
01:14:36,209 --> 01:14:38,200
...a baby was left
outside this orphanage.

565
01:14:38,411 --> 01:14:40,504
My wife and I were the ones
who adopted her.

566
01:14:40,713 --> 01:14:43,511
I'm very happy for you,
Mr. Da Silva...

567
01:14:43,716 --> 01:14:47,517
...but I can't give out
information on our children.

568
01:14:49,123 --> 01:14:50,420
Look.

569
01:14:51,792 --> 01:14:54,784
That girl, she looks
exactly like my daughter.

570
01:14:54,995 --> 01:14:56,986
I can't help you, I'm sorry.

571
01:14:57,197 --> 01:14:59,825
-It's late.
-She must be 40 now.

572
01:15:00,034 --> 01:15:01,228
Where can I find her?

573
01:15:02,102 --> 01:15:04,002
This story isn't hers alone...

574
01:15:04,204 --> 01:15:05,899
-...but all of ours!
-You people.

575
01:15:06,106 --> 01:15:07,266
You got yourself something.

576
01:15:07,474 --> 01:15:10,443
You know what you got now, Chris?
How about breaking and entering?

577
01:15:10,644 --> 01:15:12,737
By the looks of this,
a little assault as well.

578
01:15:13,447 --> 01:15:15,142
Thank you, Thomas.

579
01:15:15,349 --> 01:15:17,977
-This can't go any farther.
-lt won't, Sister.

580
01:15:19,486 --> 01:15:21,647
You know,
I have some 1 2-year-olds...

581
01:15:21,855 --> 01:15:24,221
...who cover their tracks
better than you do.

582
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:25,922
What's this?

583
01:15:26,126 --> 01:15:27,684
Look, Gucci, do you know her?

584
01:15:27,895 --> 01:15:30,329
Is that my daughter's birth mother?

585
01:15:35,569 --> 01:15:39,005
-Look, turn around.
-What are you doing?

586
01:15:41,108 --> 01:15:44,134
I knew that girl. I did.

587
01:15:45,312 --> 01:15:47,837
I was told she didn't make it
through the night.

588
01:15:48,315 --> 01:15:50,249
The night of the fire.

589
01:15:50,517 --> 01:15:52,508
The night of the big fire
in Silent Hill.

590
01:15:54,856 --> 01:15:57,256
There were these people...

591
01:15:59,227 --> 01:16:00,421
...these fanatics.

592
01:16:00,628 --> 01:16:03,859
What they did
to that child was terrible.

593
01:16:04,099 --> 01:16:06,795
That was 30 years ago,
and it's over now.

594
01:16:07,268 --> 01:16:08,860
Not as far as I'm concerned.

595
01:16:09,537 --> 01:16:11,562
What's it gonna be, city boy?

596
01:16:11,773 --> 01:16:14,264
I can put you in jail...

597
01:16:14,476 --> 01:16:16,137
...or you can go home.

598
01:16:16,778 --> 01:16:19,474
And that's your definition of justice?

599
01:16:20,648 --> 01:16:24,379
Many different forms
of justice, Chris.

600
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:28,146
See, you've got man's, God's...

601
01:16:29,157 --> 01:16:31,057
...and even the devil's.

602
01:16:32,494 --> 01:16:35,224
Certain forms you just can't control.

603
01:16:36,197 --> 01:16:38,392
So I want you to go home now...

604
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,030
...to your nice warm bed...

605
01:16:41,236 --> 01:16:43,670
...and let me deal with this town...

606
01:16:43,872 --> 01:16:46,602
...and what has happened
over the last 30 years.

607
01:16:46,808 --> 01:16:49,572
Okay? End of story.

608
01:17:01,991 --> 01:17:04,391
Tell me first how you got here.

609
01:17:06,529 --> 01:17:08,997
Honestly, I don't know
how I got here.

610
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:12,065
Right now, I've lost my little girl...

611
01:17:12,268 --> 01:17:14,896
...and all I know is that
I'm supposed to be in this church.

612
01:17:15,104 --> 01:17:17,129
Are you a person of faith?

613
01:17:17,339 --> 01:17:19,603
-I love my daughter.
-That's not what I asked.

614
01:17:20,009 --> 01:17:21,135
Who are you to judge?

615
01:17:21,343 --> 01:17:24,540
We judge because the souls of history
hang in the balance.

616
01:17:24,747 --> 01:17:26,374
Because our faith
has never failed us.

617
01:17:26,582 --> 01:17:29,016
Our faith keeps the darkness
of hell at bay.

618
01:17:29,218 --> 01:17:32,813
Then use your faith
to help me find my little girl.

619
01:17:33,456 --> 01:17:35,481
Only the demon knows where she is.

620
01:17:35,691 --> 01:17:37,921
Then tell me,
where do I find this demon?

621
01:17:39,795 --> 01:17:42,286
No one has ever returned
from the core of the darkness...

622
01:17:42,498 --> 01:17:43,897
...where the demon lies in wait.

623
01:17:44,099 --> 01:17:45,532
She's not gonna help us.
Let's go.

624
01:17:45,734 --> 01:17:48,259
If you wish to face the demon
to find your daughter...

625
01:17:48,471 --> 01:17:49,665
...I won't stop you.

626
01:17:49,872 --> 01:17:52,534
-Christabella, they can't go down--
-Silence, Adam.

627
01:17:56,278 --> 01:17:58,940
Perhaps your faith will protect you.

628
01:17:59,415 --> 01:18:01,474
Perhaps not.

629
01:18:15,332 --> 01:18:17,562
If you don't wanna do this...

630
01:18:18,568 --> 01:18:20,559
...I'll understand.

631
01:18:21,771 --> 01:18:23,739
Sharon's adopted...

632
01:18:24,641 --> 01:18:25,869
...but I'm her mother.

633
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:29,136
I knew that from the moment
I first laid eyes on her.

634
01:18:31,481 --> 01:18:33,381
She's lucky to have you.

635
01:18:34,818 --> 01:18:37,514
Mother is God in the eyes of a child.

636
01:19:48,426 --> 01:19:49,859
Quiet.

637
01:19:50,161 --> 01:19:52,686
We're in his domain now.

638
01:19:58,169 --> 01:20:00,433
Look at this map. Memorize it.

639
01:20:01,472 --> 01:20:03,599
Your memory may save your life.

640
01:20:05,009 --> 01:20:07,944
-Do you see this room?
-Yeah.

641
01:20:08,145 --> 01:20:10,841
That is where the darkness lies.

642
01:20:11,048 --> 01:20:13,448
The demon is in the bowels
of this building.

643
01:20:13,651 --> 01:20:16,017
It hides behind the face
of an innocent.

644
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:17,517
You mean a child?

645
01:20:17,722 --> 01:20:19,986
Don't believe your eyes.
Your eyes will lie to you.

646
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:23,251
Faith is the only truth.

647
01:20:24,328 --> 01:20:25,523
I will pray for you, Rose...

648
01:20:25,731 --> 01:20:28,996
...but I won't expect you
and your friend to return.

649
01:20:29,868 --> 01:20:31,392
Goodbye.

650
01:20:33,839 --> 01:20:35,204
Adam.

651
01:20:36,408 --> 01:20:38,899
Left. Right.

652
01:20:39,611 --> 01:20:41,943
Left. Left.

653
01:20:43,181 --> 01:20:47,083
-Right. Right. Left.
-Take them to the lower level.

654
01:20:47,285 --> 01:20:49,082
-ln the basement?
-Do it, then return.

655
01:20:49,287 --> 01:20:51,653
-Left. 3A.
-But--

656
01:20:51,857 --> 01:20:53,415
-Right. 4A.
-I said, do it.

657
01:20:54,259 --> 01:20:57,751
-Left. Left. Right.
-Rose. Rose.

658
01:20:58,330 --> 01:21:02,824
-Left. Right. Left. Left.
-Rose, she's killing you.

659
01:21:03,035 --> 01:21:05,333
-Rose!
-Let me do this.

660
01:21:06,338 --> 01:21:08,499
I need to do this.

661
01:21:26,525 --> 01:21:28,083
Take this.

662
01:21:28,293 --> 01:21:32,127
They'll be drawn to the light,
but you won't be able to see without it.

663
01:21:34,967 --> 01:21:36,662
Thank you.

664
01:21:43,076 --> 01:21:45,840
-So this thing actually works?
-lt will.

665
01:21:46,045 --> 01:21:48,036
If the demon wants you, it will.

666
01:21:50,249 --> 01:21:51,443
Forgive me.

667
01:21:52,852 --> 01:21:55,514
We've lived too long as scavengers.
I believe this is yours.

668
01:22:03,162 --> 01:22:05,858
Witch! Her child's
the likeness of Alessa.

669
01:22:06,065 --> 01:22:07,396
Her child's the next vessel.

670
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,398
Stop her!
Don't let the witches go down!

671
01:22:15,274 --> 01:22:16,798
Come on!

672
01:22:26,385 --> 01:22:27,682
Get off her!

673
01:22:29,889 --> 01:22:31,186
Find her.

674
01:22:31,924 --> 01:22:34,586
No! Wait! Cybil!

675
01:22:34,794 --> 01:22:36,921
Cybil! Open the door!

676
01:22:59,787 --> 01:23:02,415
No!

677
01:24:31,112 --> 01:24:32,670
8A.

678
01:24:33,214 --> 01:24:37,514
7A. Right.

679
01:24:47,629 --> 01:24:50,826
Right. 6A.

680
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,200
4A.

681
01:24:55,236 --> 01:24:57,067
3A.

682
01:24:59,708 --> 01:25:02,438
Left, left. Right, right.

683
01:25:02,645 --> 01:25:05,307
Left, left.

684
01:26:19,356 --> 01:26:23,292
Okay. I can do this.

685
01:27:34,365 --> 01:27:37,266
Congratulations, Rose.

686
01:27:37,468 --> 01:27:39,060
You're here.

687
01:27:40,704 --> 01:27:42,228
You did it.

688
01:27:44,008 --> 01:27:48,377
Your reward is the truth.

689
01:27:51,115 --> 01:27:55,211
Did you see that Alessa
was a good little girl?

690
01:27:57,922 --> 01:28:01,414
Even though nobody
looked at her that way.

691
01:28:02,193 --> 01:28:07,631
-Burn the witch! Burn the witch!
-Their parents told them she was bad.

692
01:28:08,699 --> 01:28:12,032
She didn't have a father
like they did.

693
01:28:18,342 --> 01:28:21,277
Alessa was alone in the world.

694
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:30,087
You know what can happen
to little girls when they're left alone.

695
01:28:34,126 --> 01:28:36,151
It's okay, it's me, come on.

696
01:28:36,361 --> 01:28:38,727
Even her mother couldn't help.

697
01:28:41,133 --> 01:28:44,102
Even though she loved her baby.

698
01:28:45,003 --> 01:28:47,904
But the rest of the family
didn't love Alessa.

699
01:28:48,106 --> 01:28:51,371
They were just like the others
and made her scared.

700
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,441
We know.
Even the children know it.

701
01:28:53,645 --> 01:28:55,135
Your daughter....

702
01:28:56,481 --> 01:28:58,779
Why you won't
just name the father....

703
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:04,916
You've brought sin amongst us.

704
01:29:05,123 --> 01:29:07,057
The faithful must gather
in judgment...

705
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:10,319
...for we are called to purify this filth.

706
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,426
What does she mean, Mommy?

707
01:29:12,998 --> 01:29:16,297
You're weak, my dear sister.
You always were.

708
01:29:16,501 --> 01:29:19,993
Trust us, Dahlia.
Have faith in our virtue.

709
01:29:20,205 --> 01:29:22,696
We will restore innocence.

710
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:27,573
They had met many times
since the town was built...

711
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:30,977
...to restore innocence and purity.

712
01:29:31,984 --> 01:29:34,179
They had a special place for that.

713
01:29:46,699 --> 01:29:49,133
Do you remember the hotel?

714
01:29:49,702 --> 01:29:52,466
I led you to all these places...

715
01:29:52,672 --> 01:29:56,108
...and you were very good
at following my clues.

716
01:29:56,909 --> 01:29:59,104
You may leave, Dahlia.

717
01:29:59,879 --> 01:30:01,710
We fight the sin, not the sinner.

718
01:30:02,315 --> 01:30:04,510
Mommy! Mommy!

719
01:30:05,251 --> 01:30:06,775
Mommy!

720
01:30:06,986 --> 01:30:10,285
You know how that feels,
don't you, Rose?

721
01:30:10,856 --> 01:30:13,188
To lose your little girl?

722
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:16,053
What have I done?

723
01:30:18,631 --> 01:30:22,863
-Oh, God.
-Weep not for the demon.

724
01:30:23,436 --> 01:30:24,664
No!

725
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:28,636
Once again
we are locked in mortal battle.

726
01:30:29,275 --> 01:30:32,836
They thought they knew
how to cast out evil.

727
01:30:34,013 --> 01:30:37,779
-Praise God for our clarity.
-Amen.

728
01:30:37,985 --> 01:30:42,183
Praise the innocent
for their sacrifice.

729
01:30:42,389 --> 01:30:44,357
But you should be careful
how you fight evil.

730
01:30:44,558 --> 01:30:47,652
-They give us back our purity.
-Purity.

731
01:30:50,831 --> 01:30:52,731
-And our unity.
-Unity.

732
01:30:52,933 --> 01:30:56,562
Your weapons
can turn back on you.

733
01:31:22,062 --> 01:31:23,393
No.

734
01:31:25,165 --> 01:31:26,496
No.

735
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:29,760
Now you know
why Dahlia is broken.

736
01:31:31,405 --> 01:31:33,771
She tried to get help...

737
01:31:33,974 --> 01:31:36,101
...but she went too late.

738
01:31:37,511 --> 01:31:39,706
Get her up, boys.
Get her up now!

739
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,344
There were good people
in the town...

740
01:31:42,549 --> 01:31:44,779
...people like you, Rose.

741
01:31:44,985 --> 01:31:47,420
People who like to help.

742
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:54,492
Alessa was so lonely
and hurt and scared.

743
01:31:55,063 --> 01:31:57,759
They should have known better
than to hurt her so badly.

744
01:32:01,169 --> 01:32:03,763
When you're hurt
and scared for so long...

745
01:32:04,739 --> 01:32:07,173
...your fear and pain turn to hate...

746
01:32:07,375 --> 01:32:11,436
...and the hate
starts to change the world.

747
01:32:14,282 --> 01:32:19,185
Alessa 's hate grew and grew,
burning inside her.

748
01:32:23,491 --> 01:32:26,153
Her hate got so strong...

749
01:32:26,761 --> 01:32:30,492
...she even hurt someone
who was only curious.

750
01:32:44,846 --> 01:32:47,007
That's when I came.

751
01:32:54,123 --> 01:32:56,057
I told her it was their turn.

752
01:32:57,993 --> 01:33:03,693
I promised they would all
fall into her darkest dream.

753
01:33:33,395 --> 01:33:38,059
Now, Rose, we must talk.

754
01:34:30,787 --> 01:34:33,153
Don't be afraid.

755
01:34:39,429 --> 01:34:41,329
She won't hurt you.

756
01:34:41,965 --> 01:34:44,160
She needs your help.

757
01:34:44,367 --> 01:34:45,561
Who is she?

758
01:34:46,636 --> 01:34:49,730
-She is Alessa.
-Then who are you?

759
01:34:50,173 --> 01:34:54,109
I have many names.

760
01:34:54,677 --> 01:34:58,477
Right now,
I'm the dark part of Alessa.

761
01:34:59,916 --> 01:35:01,315
Where's my child?

762
01:35:01,818 --> 01:35:04,810
She's not your child.

763
01:35:06,890 --> 01:35:08,187
She's hers.

764
01:35:09,292 --> 01:35:12,990
The little girl is
what's left of her goodness.

765
01:35:13,330 --> 01:35:14,922
We hid her in safety...

766
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,264
...in the world outside this hell.

767
01:35:31,181 --> 01:35:35,481
Now the dream
of this life must end...

768
01:35:35,686 --> 01:35:39,554
...and so, too,
must the dreamers within it.

769
01:35:39,757 --> 01:35:42,089
For over 30 years...

770
01:35:42,293 --> 01:35:45,387
...they've lied to their own souls.

771
01:35:45,596 --> 01:35:49,828
For 30 years they've denied
their own fate.

772
01:35:50,034 --> 01:35:53,162
But now is the end of days...

773
01:35:53,370 --> 01:35:56,203
...and I am the reaper.

774
01:35:56,707 --> 01:35:58,368
What do you want?

775
01:35:58,709 --> 01:36:01,075
All we ask for is satisfaction.

776
01:36:01,712 --> 01:36:03,077
Satisfaction?

777
01:36:03,981 --> 01:36:05,881
Revenge.

778
01:36:07,718 --> 01:36:09,413
Why me?

779
01:36:09,887 --> 01:36:11,821
You chose.

780
01:36:12,289 --> 01:36:14,587
You chose Sharon.

781
01:36:14,792 --> 01:36:18,057
Christabella will find Sharon.

782
01:36:18,263 --> 01:36:21,130
She plans to purify her.

783
01:36:23,401 --> 01:36:25,392
Oh, God, no.

784
01:36:26,037 --> 01:36:29,404
Their blind conviction
repels me from their church.

785
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:33,268
I cannot enter
while they deny their fate...

786
01:36:33,478 --> 01:36:34,945
...but you can.

787
01:36:35,847 --> 01:36:40,614
-Just tell me what I need to do.
-Tell them the truth.

788
01:37:53,492 --> 01:37:55,392
The child is mine!

789
01:37:55,594 --> 01:37:57,562
Mine!

790
01:38:03,102 --> 01:38:04,967
She's mine.

791
01:38:06,772 --> 01:38:08,637
She's mine!

792
01:38:14,647 --> 01:38:17,878
The truth is clear to those who see.

793
01:38:18,984 --> 01:38:22,579
Just as I could see
you had this child.

794
01:38:41,408 --> 01:38:42,932
Let's go.

795
01:38:45,645 --> 01:38:48,705
Out of the car. Turn around.

796
01:39:03,764 --> 01:39:05,732
Just a friendly warning...

797
01:39:06,333 --> 01:39:08,767
...I'll be back with people
who know what they're doing.

798
01:39:11,605 --> 01:39:15,336
Before you do that, Chris,
I wanna tell you about Officer Bennett.

799
01:39:16,977 --> 01:39:19,969
Few years back, some wacko,
he abducted a kid...

800
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:23,308
...threw him down a mine vent
up there in Silent Hill.

801
01:39:23,717 --> 01:39:25,981
Cybil Bennett, she found that boy.

802
01:39:26,186 --> 01:39:27,881
She spent three days
holding onto him...

803
01:39:28,088 --> 01:39:30,283
...keeping him alive
until they were rescued.

804
01:39:30,490 --> 01:39:31,923
We know what we're doing.

805
01:39:32,125 --> 01:39:34,093
I need to do everything I can.

806
01:39:41,067 --> 01:39:42,865
Let's go.

807
01:40:06,561 --> 01:40:08,756
Please.
Christabella, let her live.

808
01:40:08,963 --> 01:40:11,193
Your weakness
led these souls to judgment.

809
01:40:11,399 --> 01:40:13,663
-This time you will bear witness.
-She is innocent.

810
01:40:13,868 --> 01:40:16,860
Look at her.
She's the whelp of your daughter.

811
01:40:17,071 --> 01:40:18,265
The demon!

812
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:24,073
The demon fathered this disgusting
abomination from her child!

813
01:40:24,278 --> 01:40:25,302
No, she's mine!

814
01:40:28,482 --> 01:40:30,541
Sharon. Sharon, look at me.

815
01:40:30,751 --> 01:40:33,311
Look at me. Don't be afraid.

816
01:40:33,521 --> 01:40:37,013
It's okay, it's okay.
Your mama's coming.

817
01:40:37,792 --> 01:40:41,455
Once again we are called upon
to restore innocence.

818
01:40:41,662 --> 01:40:45,530
We burn this witch.
We vanquish evil.

819
01:40:46,467 --> 01:40:48,628
No. You can't. You can't.

820
01:40:48,836 --> 01:40:51,465
-Don't let her say this! No!
-We burn the child!

821
01:40:51,673 --> 01:40:53,868
We fight the demon!

822
01:40:56,879 --> 01:40:58,141
She's just a child!

823
01:40:58,347 --> 01:41:01,282
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

824
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:03,684
Let her go!

825
01:41:04,152 --> 01:41:06,347
Leave her alone!

826
01:41:06,555 --> 01:41:08,182
Leave her alone!

827
01:41:08,891 --> 01:41:10,756
Those who aid the demon...

828
01:41:10,959 --> 01:41:14,759
...they must be cleansed
by the fire from whence they came.

829
01:41:14,963 --> 01:41:17,523
That's crazy. You're crazy.

830
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:20,461
No!

831
01:41:20,669 --> 01:41:22,296
Why are you listening to this?

832
01:41:22,504 --> 01:41:24,802
Why?

833
01:41:26,642 --> 01:41:29,577
Burn the witch! Burn her!

834
01:41:29,778 --> 01:41:34,875
Burn the witch! Burn her!
Burn the witch!

835
01:41:41,924 --> 01:41:43,721
Sharon.

836
01:41:50,966 --> 01:41:52,991
Evil witch!

837
01:41:53,936 --> 01:41:55,927
Suffer.

838
01:42:00,376 --> 01:42:03,004
Burn the witch! Burn her!

839
01:42:03,212 --> 01:42:06,978
Burn the witch! Burn her!

840
01:42:12,388 --> 01:42:14,754
Oh, my God.

841
01:42:22,031 --> 01:42:27,128
Burn the witch! Burn her!
Burn the witch! Burn her!

842
01:42:27,337 --> 01:42:32,434
Burn the witch! Burn her!
Burn the witch! Burn her!

843
01:42:32,642 --> 01:42:34,200
Burn her!

844
01:42:36,612 --> 01:42:38,944
You're in your own hell.

845
01:42:47,123 --> 01:42:50,854
Mama, be with me.

846
01:43:14,251 --> 01:43:16,116
Here is where the apocalypse began.

847
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:19,153
This is where we stopped
the annihilation of the world.

848
01:43:19,356 --> 01:43:21,847
We drew a line in the sand
and said:

849
01:43:22,059 --> 01:43:24,493
"Demon, you will not cross!"

850
01:43:24,695 --> 01:43:28,358
But the demon is wicked,
full of treachery.

851
01:43:28,565 --> 01:43:32,729
Yet again he comes to tempt us
in the guise of an innocent.

852
01:43:32,936 --> 01:43:34,927
To rid the world of this demon...

853
01:43:35,139 --> 01:43:37,767
...we must burn this child!

854
01:43:39,610 --> 01:43:41,601
That's not gonna happen!

855
01:43:44,648 --> 01:43:45,615
Mommy!

856
01:43:46,717 --> 01:43:50,118
It's okay, baby.
Everything's gonna be okay.

857
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,049
Oh, my God.

858
01:43:52,256 --> 01:43:54,315
Oh, my God.

859
01:43:54,525 --> 01:43:56,652
What have you people done?

860
01:43:56,860 --> 01:44:00,125
-You have returned.
-Yes, I have.

861
01:44:00,764 --> 01:44:02,755
The witch has returned.

862
01:44:05,736 --> 01:44:09,365
Do not believe her lies.

863
01:44:09,807 --> 01:44:11,775
I come from a world
outside this place.

864
01:44:12,242 --> 01:44:14,005
I come from a world full of life!

865
01:44:17,515 --> 01:44:19,005
Why don't you tell them the truth.

866
01:44:19,217 --> 01:44:22,653
Tell them the truth that you deny,
even to yourself.

867
01:44:22,854 --> 01:44:25,015
There was no apocalypse!

868
01:44:25,223 --> 01:44:27,248
You burned in the fire
that you started...

869
01:44:27,459 --> 01:44:30,758
...and nothing can save you
because you're already damned!

870
01:44:32,630 --> 01:44:33,927
-Mommy!
-Take her.

871
01:44:34,332 --> 01:44:36,698
Burn her. Burn her as a witch.

872
01:44:37,335 --> 01:44:39,929
Burn her! Burn her!

873
01:44:40,338 --> 01:44:41,635
Demon witch!

874
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,398
-Burn me?
-Demon witch.

875
01:44:43,608 --> 01:44:45,542
That's your answer.

876
01:44:46,111 --> 01:44:48,079
Burn anything you're afraid of.

877
01:44:48,279 --> 01:44:50,804
Burn anything you can't control.

878
01:44:52,717 --> 01:44:56,153
This woman uses your fear
to control you.

879
01:44:56,354 --> 01:44:58,879
She led you to burn
Alessa Gillespie.

880
01:44:59,090 --> 01:45:01,923
She led you to burn
an innocent child.

881
01:45:02,127 --> 01:45:05,324
But you will not deny your guilt...

882
01:45:05,530 --> 01:45:08,055
...and you cannot deny her pain!

883
01:45:08,266 --> 01:45:11,429
That child was sin incarnate.

884
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:15,463
No, it's you who have sinned.

885
01:45:16,741 --> 01:45:19,767
You darkened the heart
of an innocent...

886
01:45:19,978 --> 01:45:23,847
...and now you cower in the face
of Alessa's revenge.

887
01:45:24,049 --> 01:45:26,017
-Sinner.
-Heresy.

888
01:45:26,218 --> 01:45:28,243
Burn her. Burn her!

889
01:45:29,588 --> 01:45:33,615
Your faith brings death!

890
01:45:34,994 --> 01:45:36,928
You are alone in this limbo...

891
01:45:37,129 --> 01:45:39,893
...and God is not here.

892
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:42,358
Mommy!

893
01:45:55,748 --> 01:45:59,775
She was a blasphemer.

894
01:46:00,619 --> 01:46:03,053
Blasphemer!

895
01:46:06,025 --> 01:46:07,856
Blasphemer!

896
01:47:23,436 --> 01:47:25,199
What have you done?

897
01:47:26,106 --> 01:47:28,040
You've brought the darkness in
with you.

898
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:31,168
Do you know what you've done?

899
01:47:40,321 --> 01:47:42,221
For Sharon.

900
01:47:46,927 --> 01:47:48,622
Mommy.

901
01:47:48,829 --> 01:47:51,696
Mommy. Mommy.

902
01:49:05,207 --> 01:49:06,799
Mommy!

903
01:49:35,737 --> 01:49:39,673
Oh, Lord, give me the strength
to stay pure.

904
01:50:13,943 --> 01:50:16,468
No! No!

905
01:50:48,478 --> 01:50:52,608
Alessa, what have you become?

906
01:51:06,697 --> 01:51:08,597
Mommy!

907
01:51:09,833 --> 01:51:13,269
Sharon! Sharon, honey, it's me.
It's Mommy.

908
01:51:34,525 --> 01:51:35,856
Down! We're getting down.

909
01:51:36,059 --> 01:51:38,493
Shut your eyes.
Shut your eyes, baby.

910
01:51:39,563 --> 01:51:41,258
Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes.

911
01:51:50,073 --> 01:51:52,268
Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes.

912
01:51:52,476 --> 01:51:55,968
It's just a bad dream.
It's just a bad dream.

913
01:52:44,662 --> 01:52:48,120
Why did she not take me
with the others?

914
01:52:50,001 --> 01:52:52,128
Because you're her mother.

915
01:52:57,041 --> 01:53:00,033
Mother is God in the eyes of a child.

916
01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:29,971
I love you.

917
01:54:39,112 --> 01:54:41,376
-Hi, this is Chris.
-And this is Rose.

918
01:54:41,581 --> 01:54:43,378
And I'm Sharon Da Silva.

919
01:54:43,583 --> 01:54:45,983
Please leave a message!

920
01:54:47,921 --> 01:54:50,515
Christopher, it's me.

921
01:54:51,124 --> 01:54:52,386
I'm with Sharon.

922
01:54:54,494 --> 01:54:57,861
Hello? Hello? Rose?

923
01:54:58,331 --> 01:54:59,764
Rose?

924
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,594
Yeah. We're coming home.
