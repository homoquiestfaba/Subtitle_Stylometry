Lou:
<i>Whose fucking phone is on?</i>

5
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,507
Man: Uh, we're going
to just touch you up.

6
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:42,908
- Okay, Mr. Dorchen?
- Hey.

7
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,511
Do I need nipple Rouge?

8
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:46,912
Man: Uh, can we get...
I don't, uh...

9
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:49,014
Do I need any nipple Rouge?

10
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,250
Man: Yeah.
Touch up his nipples, please.

11
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:52,418
(Giggles)

12
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,686
What kind of brush is that?
Is that rabbit fur?

13
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:57,523
Narrator: <i>Lou Dorchen,
the legendary lead singer</i>

14
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,658
<i>of the metal supergroup
motley Lue,</i>

15
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,227

00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,830
<i>to become the very definition
of a rock God.</i>

17
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:06,932
<i>Livin' the dream with
high school sweetheart</i>

18
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:11,170
<i>So how did the ultimate party
animal get the inspiration</i>

19
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:13,405
<i>to build the most innovative,
forward-thinking</i>

20

<i>tech company in the world?</i>

21
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:16,508
I don't have to tell
you where I got

22
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,277
my inspiration from,
first of all.

23
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:21,180
Because that's called
"intellectual property"

24
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:22,748
and I can copyright that shit.

25
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,616
Just like I copyrighted
the word "well,"

26
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:26,819
so you can't even say "well"
without paying me money.

27
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,755
- Man: Uh, well, um...
- You owe me money.

Ever since I wrote <i> let's get</i>

31
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:38,697
I've been on a roll.

You oughta know.
Feelin' like teen spirit.

35
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:50,275
<i>I guess you could say
I take from a lot of artists.</i>

36
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,945
Take my inspiration
from a lot of artists.

37
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,213
I don't...

38
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:57,149
I don't take their stuff.

39
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,551
That's... who would do that?

40
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:02,221
- Yeah. Ask me anything.
- Man: Okay.

41
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:04,389

Narrator: <i> Still struggling</i>

44
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:15,567
He didn't invent
Goo... lougle.

45
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,137
He couldn't invent his way
out of a fucking paper bag.

46
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,772
And that's...
That's not a turn of phrase,

47
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,441
that's anecdotal evidence.

48
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:25,344
He got caught in a giant paper

But Adam, he's, uh... he's off
on an experiential journey.

54
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:40,092
I got a feeling
we'll see him again.

55
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,529

<i>We turned to high school pal,
Gary Winkle.</i>

63
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,648

that I was supposed
to go on that trip, huh?

64
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,983
- I stood outside all day...

00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:08,220

Left me hanging.

66
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:09,821
You know what
I got that weekend?

67
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,057
Chlamydia from

I mean, at the end of the day,

71
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,833
I'm just a simple guy like you

of great ideas

73

that happen to make him
a bunch of money. That's it.

74
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,874
I mean,
how was I supposed to know

75
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,177
that it would change
the fabric of our existence?
I couldn't.

76
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:36,081
You know, I couldn't,
unless I had some sort of...

<i>Well, as much of it

96

The lyrics I made up
were original.

97
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,271
Listen, Nick, I get it.

98
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,939
You don't have
any natural talent.

99
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,908
All I know is that hot tub
made me a king.

100
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,743
It's my duty to live up
to the throne.

101
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,111
All right,
I can't see you right now,

102
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,814
but I'm gonna assume
you're putting "King"
and "Throne" in quotes.

<i>What do you want?</i>

104
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,986
Hey, Nick, I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to be a dick.

105
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,621
Are you coming to Lou's party?

106
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:25,924

Oh, really?
Still fighting, huh?

109
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,296
Why don't you just write her
a Josh Groban song?

You took most of the doors out

120

What do you want?
Put it down!

121
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,455

You're welcome, mom and dad.
I'm just happy that
you guys are happy.

126

What the fuck are
you still doing here?

127
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,571
Today's my birthday,
by the way.

128
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:15,006
- Happy Birthday.
- Oh, thanks, mom.

129
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,042
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

130
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:20,345
I got you...
I got you something.
It'll be here tomorrow,

131
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:21,847
via Fedex.

132
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,215
- Right.
- Daddy's little buddy is

00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,183
turning into
daddy's big buddy.

134
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,419
I'm going to help you out.
It's not really my birthday.

135
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:28,854
Do you know what day it is?

136
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:32,257
Mmm... (Pops)

137
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,695
Okay. Enjoy your shit.

138
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:39,598
The sooner you choke to
death on it, the sooner
I get all this.

139
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,440
Any other questions,
or is this interview over?

140
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,806
Don't let the lack of a door
hit you on the way out.

141
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,542

gets me so mad.

142
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:53,378
- So who is he?
- That's my Butler.

143
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,113
And our son, consequently.

144
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,315
Oh, my God. Right.

145
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,619
Lisa Loeb?

146
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,854
Oh, my God. I can't believe
Nick Webber knows

147
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,523
the name of the cat wrangler.

148
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,124
Yeah. Crazy, right?

149
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,259
You know,
I just have to tell you,

150
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,960
I really love this song
so much.

151
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,029
- It feels so personal.
- Mmm.

152
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,432
It's almost...
Violating.

153
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,436
(Softly)
I'm so sorry.

154
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,249
Lou: Yeah!

155
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,651
Nailed it!

Uh, Mr. Dorchen, could we get
this board meeting started?

160
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,270
Yeah. Brad, do your thing.

161
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,805
Ladies and gentlemen...

162
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,174
- Lougle is at a crossroads.
- Whoo!

163
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:59,945
We did it, guys!
We got to the crossroads!

164
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:03,014
Our competitors lycos and
geocities are crushing us.

165
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,116
Those guys are fucking nerds,
Brad.

166
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,785
(Chuckles) What about yahoo,
huh? Where are they?

167
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,286
Yahoo? What's yahoo?

168
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,621
Exactly.

169
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,790
As your head of R&D,
I have to tell you

170
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:14,125
that lougle cannot continue
down this path.

171
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,328
Well, that's why I moved us
to new Orleans, Brad,

172
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,530
The Silicon Valley
of the South.

173
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,965
Huh?

174
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,032
(Gasps)

175
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,134
Oh, shit! Shit!
Susan, look, turn around.

176
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,703
Turn around, right now!
Susan, quick, quick, quick!

177
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,137
I'm not going to look, Lou.

178
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,039
Susan, I promise it's not
a dick and balls this time.

179
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,875
I swear to God.
Look, look, look!

180
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:33,311
Dick and balls! You looked
at a dick and balls!

181
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,546
I burned you.

182
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,648
(Chuckles)

183
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,149
I can't believe
I let you talk me

184
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:42,153
I was one of <i> engineering</i>
<i>quarterly's</i> "30 under 30."

185
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,555
Really?

186
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,524
I was on track
to be "20 under 40,"

187
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,826
but now I'm
"zero under fuck me"!

188
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,227
You fucked me, Lou.

189
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,896
You fucked my whole life.

190
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:53,999
My brother works at the NSA
and I work for a Mad Man.

191
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,567
<i>Mad Man</i> is a great show.

192
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,302
Sometimes I wish
I could just...

193
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,742
Okay, okay. Looks like
you're hungry for an idea.

194
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:06,478
So why doesn't Uncle Lou give
you guys a little taste, huh?

195
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,182
If you combine the right
amounts of nitrotrinadium

196
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,184
with specifically heated water

197
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,921
in a specialized basin,
you get

198
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:18,890
the elements necessary
for time travel!

199
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,692
(Imitates cocking shotgun)

200
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:24,095
Boom! Shotgun to the dick!
(Grunts)

201
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,033
I'm gonna be in the lab,
trying to save this company.

202
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,434
Yeah!

203
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,304
(Heavy metal music playing)

204
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:47,052
Why are all these people here?
Are we having another seance?

205
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,219
(Chuckles) Yeah.

206
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:52,123
Every day's a seance, baby.
Every day's a seance.

207
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,125
I fucking hate you
so much, Lou.

208
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,227
I fucking hate you, too, baby.

209
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,129
Courtney, it's not a big deal.

210
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,231
Well, maybe it's not
a big deal to you,

211
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,068
but she's my only sister,
and we never go visit her.

212
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,972
- It's the grammys.
- It's always the grammys.

213
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:11,376
It's not always the grammys.
Sometimes it's the grammys.

214
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,983
Oh, wow. Look at you.

215
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,584
Every fucking year, Lou?

216
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,820
Hey, enough with this
dad stuff. Call me Lou.

217
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,588
Why do I have to pretend
to be your Butler?

218
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,823
You are my Butler.

219
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,825
No, Lou, just 'cause
my room's near the bar

220
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,426
and I'm good
at receiving guests and...

221
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,328
Holy fuck, I'm your Butler.

222
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,063
Wait... hey, hey, Lou,
what do you think about,

223
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:35,266
maybe this summer, you know,
I can work with you at lougle?

224
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:36,835
Listen, this is what
I'll do for you, okay?

225
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,137
If we ever come up
with a division where

226
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,940
you sit on the couch
and masturbate while
playing video games,

227
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,274
I'll get you an interview.

228
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,944
You started
an interactive porno division.

229
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:48,513
We have that.
Even the retarded Venn Diagram

230
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,849
you just mentioned, it exists.

231
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,952
Listen, you are a key part
of this operation, Jacob.

232
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,353
Really?

233
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,022
You're my Chief Mixologist!

234
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,623
Yay.

235
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,691
Bloop.

236
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:02,027
I love you, buddy.

237
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:05,530
Hey, Courtney.
Your tits look fantastic!

238
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,265
Eat shit, Lou.

239
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,035
(Chuckling)

240
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,672
(Sighs) She's one
of the good ones, man.

241
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,440
Come on. Let's get a drink.

242
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,222
Jeez. The place
is like a deathtrap, huh?

243
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,458
Just lousy with statues,
and the...

244
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,896
Not a lot of coats, right?
Not a lot of coats.

245
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,831
Can I take your jacket?

246
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,835
Oh, no, no, no. I'm actually
kind of "on the job" tonight.

247
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,970
It's my dad's party,
he runs lougle.

248
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,039
What do you do?

249
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,241
(Stammers) You know,
I'm just kind of
a Jack-of-all-trades.

250
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,976
- So you're the Butler.
- No! (Scoffs)

251
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,082
Come on. Do I look like
a Butler to you?

252
00:11:57,084 --> 00:12:00,251
You look exactly
like a Butler.

253
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,020
Goddamn, it's good
to see you, man.

254
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,354
You, too, buddy.

255
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:06,691
Man. That tub, huh?

256
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,193
Really turned it all around.

257
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,095
It's the best thing that
ever happened to me.

258
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:16,101
You ever wish we could
go back for one more dip?

259
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,036
You know, tweak some things?

260
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,605
Use time travel
for more important reasons.

261
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,841
Too bad the tub is gone.

262
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,542
Yeah.

263
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:25,777
Too bad.

264
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,612
Oh, fuck.

265
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,749
Sorry.

266
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,117
What the fuck? Lou...

267
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,786
Nick-Nack-Paddywhack!
Give a dog a what?

268
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:36,788
Gary Winkle.

269
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,591
Look at this. Look,
Lou spilled his drink on me

270
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,726
so I don't have
to talk to you.

271
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,294
Good looking out.

272
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,063
Okay,
just laying it all out there.

273
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,565
Where are me and you right now
on a scale of, like,

274
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,802
"dinner and a movie"
to "tropical sex vacation"?

275
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:54,139
We're on the "it's never,
ever going to happen"
part of the scale.

276
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:56,074
- So, like a four.
- One and a half.

277
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,209
- Mmm-hmm. (Gulps)
- Minus the half.

278
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,278
What are you selling, Gary?

279
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,981
What? No love for Gary Winkle?

280
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:06,084
Okay, but it is a sound
investment this time.
I'm telling you, man.

281
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,318
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

282
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,087
It is only 12 blocks
from the river.

283
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,590
Pristine lot.
You can build an office tower,

284
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:15,093
nightclub, combo,
whatever the fuck.

285
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:18,496
Okay, I get it, man, I get it.
I get it. I'm a loser.

286
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,597
Okay, I'm always
going to be a loser.

287
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:23,768
I didn't magically turn it all
around after that ski trip.

288
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,436
All I got is this
piece of land,

289
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,338
and I know
it's a piece of shit, okay?

290
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,941
But it's...
It can be our piece of shit.

291
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,176
Not interested. Pass.

292
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,683
Bruce buffer: <i> We are live!</i>

293
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:41,686
<i>Coming to you

294
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,855
<i>At the height of his career</i>

295
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:48,026
<i>worth 2.3 billion dollars,</i>

296
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:52,764
<i>introducing Lou "The Violator"</i>

297
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:54,866
<i>Dorchen!</i>

298
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,201
(Guests cheering)

299
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,880
(Glass shatters)

300
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,654
We've grown quite a bit
over the years, haven't we?

301
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:19,057
Some of us have
achieved our dreams.

302
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,726
Others have found
new dreams to chase.

303
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,328
You know, I bet...

304
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,730
I bet there's not a person
in this room who,

305
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,832
given the chance to do it
all over again

306
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,734
would do it any differently.
Am I right?

307
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,302
- Am I right?
- (All agreeing)

308
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,075
Hmm.
And if you believe that...

309
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:40,578
If you truly believe that
in your heart of hearts,

310
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,813
well, then,

311
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,181
(scoffs)

312
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:46,084
You're all a bunch
of fucking morons!

313
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,418
Genius.

314
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,522
Life is about do-overs, okay?

315
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:54,192
And if you see
your second chance

316
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:57,428
peeking its dick around
a corner, snatch it!

317
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,764
Grab it! Take my advice.

318
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,866
Look at the people
you love most in this world,

319
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:04,369
then you tell them
to go fuck themselves.

320
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,604
Because life is about
number one.

321
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:09,707
<i>Numero</i> Lou-no!

322
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,442
(Thunder rumbling)

323
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,611
So come on,
it's a party, right?

324
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:17,348
Let's all get nude and fuck!

325
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,951
(Electricity crackling)

326
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,725
(All gasp)

327
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,193
- (Groans)
- (All screaming)

328
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,664
Man: Move!

329
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,368
About time someone manned up
and shot the bastard.

330
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,406
- Holy shit, he's been shot.
- In the dick!

331
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,608
Shit! It's bad!
Somebody call an ambulance!

332
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,742
- Nick.
- Yeah, buddy.

333
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,978
You got your hand on my penis!

334
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,146
I'm applying direct pressure!

335
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:49,247
You don't have
to touch it that hard.

336
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,748
My hand is acting
as a Tourniquet!

337
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,983
You work his dick. Whatever.

338
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,785
No, no! Lou, Lou!
Stay with me!

339
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,320
Stay with me.
Look at me. Look at me.

340
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:56,421
Who shot you?

341
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:57,822
(Stammering)

342
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,590
Chux... Zedo.

343
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,826
Chuck Zito? That motherfucker!

344
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,661
- I think he's saying "Tuxedo".
- Tuxedo?

345
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:04,929
(Groans) God, it hurts so bad.

346
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,164
Who the fuck's
wearing a tuxedo?

347
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,398
(Lou sobbing)

348
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,168
What? What?

349
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,936
Okay, first of all,
this isn't a tuxedo,

350
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,604
this is a morning suit.
It's way more casual.

351
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:14,672
Mmm-hmm.

352
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,240
Don't you watch <i> downton abbey?</i>

353
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,776
I was standing right
there beside you!
I didn't fuckin' shoot him!

354
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,678
I want my dick back!

355
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,280
Lou's gonna fuckin' die!
He's out of time!

356
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,681
No, he's not.

357
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,683
We'll give him more time.

358
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,852
- What?
- Grab his arms.

359
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:31,189
Oh, God, I take it back!
I take it back!

360
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,124
I don't want a shotgun
to the dick!

361
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,026
It hurts so much!

362
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:37,261
Oh, God! Oh, God!

363
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,431
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Hang on. Trust me.

364
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,403
Whoa.

365
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,638
(Lou groaning)

366
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,440
(Nick and Jacob grunting)

367
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,449
Holy shit.

368
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,486
- I know, right?
- How?

369
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:02,720
He stole it.

370
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,556
I stole time!
I stole the whole ski lodge!

371
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,828
Check it out.
Pure Nitrotrinadium.

372
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,231
Lou got it from the Russians.
He told them he's gonna
build them a bomb.

373
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,399
Nick: Classic Lou.

374
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:15,733
Yeah. They've never seen
<i>back to the future.</i>

375
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:16,901
All right. Everybody, get in.

376
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,337
A little help here.

377
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,205
Jacob: Come on, Lou,
you got to earn it.

378
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,174
Adam's trench coat?

379
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,076
What the fuck is this?
Is Adam here?

380
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,313
Nick: Stay with me, violator.

381
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,252
Where's my hair?
It's where my power lies.

382
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:35,853
Fuck your fucking wig.

383
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,856
We gotta go back in time
and stop the killer
before he shoots Lou.

384
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,091
(Grunting)

385
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,360
No.

386
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,428
It's how it works.

387
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,596
We get blackout drunk,
we hallucinate,

388
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,198
we wake up back in time.

389
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,766
Don't mess
with a winning formula, huh?

390
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,334
Don't be a fuckin' pussy!

391
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,939
(All cheering)

392
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,528
Guys, I feel fucking great!
I think it worked.

393
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,710
(All yelling)

394
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,116
(Screams)

395
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,233
Jacob: Lou's not breathing.
Nick: I think he's gone.

396
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,488
Nick, Nick, Nick!
Help, help, help!

397
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,556
Nick: Oh, shit.

398
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,193
- Lou, Lou.
- Lou. Lou!

399
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,595
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

400
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,934
I guess we were too late.

401
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,538
Life is fucking weird,
you know?

402
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,541
I spent so much time
hating him.

403
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:39,143
And now that he's gone,
I can't help but feel...

404
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:40,211
Love.

405
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,113
No. Not love. Don't be stupid.

406
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:43,648
Respect?

407
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,816
No, that's still
way too strong a word.

408
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,385
Admiration?

409
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,387
I mean, there's nothing
admirable about him.

410
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,656
Well, I mean, he's your dad.
Honor, maybe?

411
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:54,725
Not honor. I mean,
that falls kind of with
respect and admiration.

412
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,994
Maybe just kind of a...
Just a general sense of...

413
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,129
Missing, you miss him.

414
00:19:58,131 --> 00:19:59,363
- Yeah, I miss him.
- Ah, you miss him. Yeah, yeah.

415
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,665
I motherfucking miss him.

416
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,067
What're you doing? You up
in heaven? Raping angels?

417
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,235
Good for you, buddy.

418
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:08,873
(Sighs)

419
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,743
- Oh, God.
- What the fuck?

420
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,145
I saw this on <i> C.S.I.</i>

421
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:18,182
-The bowels evacuate
when the body dies.
-Oh.

422
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:20,685
That smells like hatred.

423
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:22,253
This is gonna get worse
before it gets better.

424
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,322
- My dick! My dick!
- (Both yelling)

425
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,692
It worked! Holy shit! Look!

426
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,360
Look, look!

427
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,529
That's a good-looking
dick to me!

428
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:32,763
(Laughing)

429
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,999
My dick is back!

430
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:37,768
How far back did we go?

431
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,107
I don't know.

432
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:57,288
We put a big dryer in
so we don't have
to time travel naked.

433
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,457
This is different.

434
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:02,360
Lou: It's like a Scandinavian
gay bar.

435
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,962
Looks like a Miami Ikea.

436
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,631
Dude, it looks amazing.

437
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:08,866
I mean, look how classy it is.
It's like a museum.

438
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,007
(Gasping)

439
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,375
(Groans)

440
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:19,910
Who...

441
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,312
Who is this?

442
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,981
- I think it's Jacob.
- (Gasps)

443
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,416
Why am I bald?

444
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,318
What did you do?

445
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,919
I didn't... I didn't do that.

446
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,655
You look like a pedophile
dressed you.

447
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:33,257
You look like
a Jewish Jason Statham.

448
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:35,826
You look like Michael chiklis
fucked big daddy warbucks,

449
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,161
who fucked Lex Luthor.

450
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,430
That's what it is.

451
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:40,831
And... and...
Who's the little doggie?

452
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,167
What's he do... what's he
just doing there like this?

453
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,102
Why aren't you fucking
that doggie?

454
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:46,671
Why would I be fucking
the dog?

455
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:48,005
Both: Power over nature.

456
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,074
Sophie: Hey, you.

457
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,744
Is that the coat-check girl?

458
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,115
Boobs.

459
00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:59,517
Hey, how are you?

460
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,954
I didn't know you had company.

461
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,623
- Yeah...
- Hey, Nick.

462
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,024
'Sup?

463
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:08,626
What's he doing here?

464
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:10,194
This is my house.

465
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,831
Think that'll hold
you till later?

466
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,966
Yeah, I'm sure.

467
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,968
- Bye, Nick.
- Bye.

468
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,370
- See you at the club?
- Right.

469
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,376
That coat-check girl is rude.

470
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:26,711
I like her.

471
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:29,113
I think it's pretty obvious
what's going on here, right.

472
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:30,214
What?

473
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:33,551

00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,586
I'm distinguished.

515
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:17,988
Oh, I should shave this,
right?

516
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,824
Yeah, that's not a good look.

517
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:21,559
This is so smooth,
I don't think I went bald.

518
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:25,162
I think this is a choice,
like Andre Agassi
or Bruce Willis or something.

519
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,598
You don't look anything like
either of those two people.

520
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,266
For one,
they're fit and handsome

521
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,168
and you're neither
of those things.

522
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,103
You look like a turtle
crawled out of his shell.

523
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:34,839
Fuck you for making me bald.

524
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:37,608
You look like an orchestra
conductor for stray cats.

525
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,110
You look like you give
lectures on public access.

526
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,179
You look like
a grown-up gerber baby.

527
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:44,782
Lou: You look like an egg
gave birth to another egg.

528
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:47,451
You look like
Gandalf the poor.

529
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:49,620
You look like
you advise Lando Calrissian.

530
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:51,288
That's a good one.

531
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,290
You look like the guy
that owns the one house
that ruins the whole street.

532
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:55,192
Have I bombed anything,
you think?

533
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,194
You look like you've never
made a correct decision.

534
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:58,462
Ever.

535
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:01,365
I have definitely given
a back-alley blowjob.

536
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,800
I gotta admit
I kinda like this.

537
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,702
I want to hit you
into the corner pocket.

538
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:07,671
Now I know why the coat-check
girl didn't like me.

539
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,440
I look like fucking shit.

540
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,480
So far so good
on this future shit, huh?

541
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:18,282
Yeah. You know what?

542
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,284
I don't feel like anything
bad's going to happen.

543
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:24,655
Hey, check it out. I found all
the gear from the painting.

544
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:25,956
- Cool, huh?
- Whoa.

545
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,024
(Laughing)

546
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,894
What happened to the bottom
of your suit?

547
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,729
That pesky little doggie
eat it?

548
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:33,130
It's called fashion, Lou.

549
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,665
You look like...

550
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:35,833
Nope, not doing any more
"you look like."

551
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:39,236
We did it on the stairs. We
did it in front of the mirror.

552
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:40,738
It'd be tacky to do it
a third time.

553
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,706
Anyway, do you guys
want some fresh clothes?

554
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,174
I got a whole closet
full of stuff.

555
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:46,410
I love this shirt.
My shit is fly.

556
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:48,579
Weren't you listening
to my speech, dude?

557
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:50,581
Always pack a bag.

558
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,317
Hey, is that...

559
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,920
- No. It is not.
- How did you get that?

560
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:57,388
- I didn't get...
- I know what it...

561
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,856
I saw what it said.

562
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,090
It doesn't say anything!

563
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,358
Was that the Cincinnati box?

564
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,760
(Both shushing)

565
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:05,362
- Don't say that out loud.
- It might hear you.

566
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:07,765
You're really never
going to tell me
what's inside that box?

567
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10,868
Okay, we'll tell you.
We'll tell him.

568
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,770
- I'm going to tell him.
- Nick: Lou.

569
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:15,573
It's the declaration
of independence
with a map on the back.

570
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,708
- Our family's chosen.
- Yep.

571
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,543
That's just the plot of that
movie <i> national treasure.</i>

572
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:23,013
<i>That's raiders of the Lost
Ark. You're not even tryin'.</i>

573
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,882
I mean,
that's not even anything
that could be in the box.

574
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:26,684
Okay, this has gone on
long enough.

575
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:27,785
Okay.

576
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:30,087
It's a ring that
turns you invisible

577
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,889
and carries with it
the power of evil.

578
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:34,458
I've seen fucking movies,
you guys! I've seen movies!

579
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,527
Wait, why are you alive?

580
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:37,628
What?

581
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,563
Why are you alive?
We're in the future.

582
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,231
Yeah, you know what?
He's right.

583
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,133
'Cause if we went back
in time, you'd be alive.

584
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,935
But we went 10 years
in the fuckin' future.

585
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,236
You should be dead.

586
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:47,805
Yeah, what the fuck?

587
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:49,573
What you should be
asking yourselves is,

588
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:51,141
- "when the fuck?"
- (All gasping)

589
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:53,310
Goddamn it!

590
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,980
- This fucking guy again!
- Why do you do that?

591
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:57,815
Lou: He's not going
to tell us anything.

592
00:26:57,817 --> 00:27:00,317
Hey, why don't you make
like a fuck off
and get out of here?

593
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,553
Wait. So all we have
to do is go back

594
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:04,655
and Lou's gonna
be okay, right?

595
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:07,257
It's not that simple, really.

596
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,493
The hot tub doesn't take you
where you want to go.

597
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,095
It takes you
where you need to go.

598
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,262
Come on!

599
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:15,933
There are certain calculations
and innovations

600
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:19,436
and salutations that haven't
even come to pass yet.

601
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,338
What the hell does that mean?

602
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,940
What it means is,
at the present,

603
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:24,675
your tub here is just a tub.

604
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:27,344
Wait, are you saying that time
travel is not even possible?

605
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:30,180
Right on, Liz.
Give the pretty lady a flower.

606
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:31,782
- Damn it.
- Lizzie.

607
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:33,851
That's bullshit, okay?

608
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:37,121
We got a whole vault
of nitro right here. (Gasps)

609
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:39,256
Where'd it go?
Where did it go?

610
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,292
What did you do with my nitro?

611
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:45,129
How can I take
what doesn't exist yet?

612
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:47,531
It exists in the past. How can
it not exist in the future?

613
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:50,367
The past, the future.
All very cute.

614
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,603
But who's to say the past
isn't anything more

615
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:55,305
than the future
of this present?

616
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,107
So nitro is from the future?

617
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,208
(Sighs)

618
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,643
Like <i> Terminator.</i>

619
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:01,045
- Yeah.
- Oh! Oh, my God.

620
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:03,213
You think everything
is like <i> Terminator.</i>

621
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:04,982
'Cause everything
is like <i> Terminator!</i>

622
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:07,184
Arnold's hand gets chopped off
in the past,

623
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:10,320
somebody finds it, reverse
engineers that shit. Boom!

624
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,790
Terminators running all
around this motherfucker.

625
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:14,491
That's how we got nitro?

626
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:16,994
I don't know.
I never saw <i> Terminator.</i>

627
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:19,063
Oh, fuck this guy
and his riddles!

628
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,965
- (Vocalizing)
- (Grunts)

629
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,672
Thanks for holding him
down for me!

630
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:29,840
"Hold him down"?

631
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:31,909
So you can beat to death
the mystical time baron

632
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:33,510
that holds the keys
to our very existence?

633
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:35,079
That's your fucking plan here?

634
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:36,413
(Scoffs) Shut up.

635
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:37,881
Tighten your shit up. Lou.
We needed him.

636
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,083
Amateur hour.

637
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,418
This thing is awesome.

638
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,020
I probably invented it.

639
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:45,355
"Lou sux

640
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:49,393
"Cox n Dix." Flip it.
(Laughs)

641
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,361
Okay.

642
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:52,763
Try to stay with me.

643
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:54,698
This is going
to get complicated.

644
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,201
This is time.

645
00:28:57,203 --> 00:28:59,703
- (Lou groans)
- And you're dead.

646
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:01,538
So Lou is killed
in our present,

647
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,373
which means that here,
in the future,

648
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,441
he should still be dead.

649
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:05,743
Well, clearly,
he's not fuckin' dead,

650
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,611
'cause he's sittin' here,
still bothering me.

651
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,213
So what that tells me is

652
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:10,914
we're in a completely
different future

653
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,450
on a completely
different timeline.

654
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:16,553
Jacob, I'm the sarlacc.

655
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,555
- (Vocalizing)
- Jacob: Okay.

656
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:22,626
Anyway, the repairman
said that the past
is actually the future

657
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:25,229
of the present we're in
right now.

658
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:29,800
So I think what that means is
the killer is from the future.

659
00:29:29,802 --> 00:29:33,470
So clearly, someone from 2025
will go back in time
and shoot Lou.

660
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,072
<i>Like Looper.</i>

661
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:36,573
Wow!

662
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,475
How about
a fucking spoiler alert?

663
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:40,711
<i>"Hey, Lou, you want
to go see Looper?"</i>

664
00:29:40,713 --> 00:29:42,613
"Nah, I got a thing
I gotta do."

665
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,481
It's in my queue! That counts.

666
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:46,583
It's the first Bruce Willis
movie we missed.

667
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:48,152
- Is Bruce in that?
- Jacob: Okay.

668
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:51,755
Plainly, just by virtue of
Lou being here alive in 2025

669
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:54,658
when we know that
he died in 2015,

670
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,160
we're here to stop
his future murder.

671
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:59,129
- Which happens in the past.
- Exactly.

672
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,264
I get this shit.

673
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:02,132
I'm bored by this shit.

674
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,468
Let's go check out the future
strip club situation.

675
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,669
High five.

676
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:07,504
Did you just say "High Five"
instead of high-fiving?

677
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,106
- High five.
- High five.

678
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:10,908
That's the laziest thing
I've ever heard.

679
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:11,975
High five.

680
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,011
You don't have
the energy for this?

681
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:16,346
No, no. You guys,
we can't just fuck around.

682
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:17,781
We got to find your murderer.

683
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,850
Or we don't have
to do any of that

684
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:21,819
and we go check out
a strip club.

685
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:22,920
(Buzzing)

686
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,021
Oh!

687
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:26,290
- You flickered.
- Ah, you're flickering.

688
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:28,025
I flickered...
Why am I flickering?

689
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:29,293
By threatening
your own existence.

690
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:30,961
Have you listened to anything
I've been saying?

691
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:32,596
I have not listened
to any of it.

692
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,031
(Sighs)

693
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,799
God, okay, fine! Fine.

694
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:39,102
We'll solve my stupid murder,
which hasn't happened yet.

695
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:43,040
Or we can just go
to a strip club. (Gasps)

696
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:44,708
Oh...

697
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,044
All right, fine!
The fucking murder thing.

698
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:05,729
(Band playing jazz)

699
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,905
Huh. Nothing's really changed.

700
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:17,427
You'd figure after 10 years,
something would be different,
right?

701
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:18,809
(Dog panting)

702
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,751
That's some sexy-ass
future shit, right there.

703
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:31,221
<i>Do you or someone you love
have a problem with Heroin?</i>

704
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,757
<i>- Speed? Ice? Smack?</i>
- Yes. Yeah. Uh-huh.

705
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,359
<i>- Wack? Jack?</i>
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

706
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:37,928
<i>Al Michaels' revenge?
Or Cocaine?</i>

707
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:41,098
First order of business,
we get ourselves some
Al Michaels' revenge, right?

708
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:45,002
<i>We can help put the "U"
back in "Re-you-venate."</i>

709
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:47,905
We're still demonizing
addiction, huh? Like it's
some kind of sickness?

710
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:51,541
-I can't wait for you
to hit rock bottom.
-(Laughs) Yeah.

711
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,543
Who in the future
would want to kill you, Lou?

712
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,212
I don't know.

713
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:58,682
The only person who's ever
had any motivation
to kill me has been me.

714
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:01,385
I treat everyone with the
utmost respect and kindness.

715
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:03,687
Lou, you tried to push me
down the stairs last week.

716
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:05,455
- As a joke!
- (Scoffs)

717
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,726
Oh, my God, it's you.

718
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,395
Jacob is the murderer.

719
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:13,697
I'm not the murderer. Come on.

720
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:17,234
Oh, really? Because you
seem to have stepped
right into my life.

721
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:20,203
You always wanted to be
the one fucking that tiger!

722
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:22,239
Lou, if I was going
to fuckin' kill you,

723
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:23,573
I wouldn't use a gun, okay?

724
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:25,943
I would spike
your mid-morning cocktail

725
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:28,045
with a tasteless,
but potent sedative.

726
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,580
And, while you slept,
I would wait the 9 hours

727
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:33,050
for it to flush out of your
system, so there's no trace.

728
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:35,252
And I would take you out
into the Gulf

729
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:37,421
and feed you to a tiger shark.

730
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:38,922
Damn, that's cold.

731
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:40,624
But I wouldn't use a gun.
(Scoffs)

732
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:44,061
I'll be making my own
mid-morning cocktail
from now on, thank you.

733
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:46,463
Man, I wish Adam was here.
He'd know what to do.

734
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,598
You just described
my whole entire life.

735
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,168
We need Adam
and he's not here.

736
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,739
Where the hell is he?

737
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:57,407
Holy shit.

738
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:59,109
When we were carrying you
after you got shot,

739
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:00,444
I saw his trench coat

740
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:02,379
<i>beside the hot tub
time machine.</i>

741
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,218
Adam murdered me.

742
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,487
Jacob:
Okay, so Adam shoots Lou,

743
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,789
then uses the hot tub
to escape somewhere in time.

744
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:13,957
Textbook.

745
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,959
Only in our fucked-up social
circle is that textbook.

746
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:17,794
Why would Adam
wanna shoot you?

747
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:20,831
I don't know. I've only been
the best of friends to him.

748
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:23,667
- You tried to fuck his wife.
- You tried to fuck his wife?

749
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,536
(Scoffs) As a joke!
Come on, you guys get that.

750
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:27,637
No.

751
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:29,973
- You get it.
- (Device beeping)

752
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:32,209
<i>In lougle financial news,
no surprise here,</i>

753
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:35,012
<i>lougle finished trading up

754
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,714
Nice. Looks like
I turned the company around.

755
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,317
I'll turn you around.

756
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,152
Somebody's grumpy
'cause they got murdered.

757
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:43,220
Nick: Mmm-hmm.

758
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,057
Adam! Come on out!

759
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,859
It's your best friends
in the whole fucking world!

760
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,394
You sure
this is the right place?

761
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:53,196
Lougle search brought up
Adam's location and DNA.

762
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,032
He's really got to fix
his privacy settings.

763
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:57,534
If he's here, I'm gonna
kill him before he kills me.

764
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:58,935
Hi. Can I help you?

765
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,507
Oh, my God.
Jacob Dorchen and Nick Webber?

766
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:05,709
- (Chuckles)
- Guilty.

767
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,078
<i>Am I on celebrity Subpoena?</i>

768
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,348
<i>Just tell me. Tell me,
am I on celebrity Subpoena?</i>

769
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,683
And hello, sir. Who are you?

770
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:15,218
- Fuck it, wrong house.
- Stop.

771
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,354
Does Adam Yates live here?

772
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:19,256
I'm Adam Yates Stedmeyer.

773
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,926
Okay, so you're married
to my aunt,

774
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:24,394
which makes you my Uncle.

775
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:29,566
But that means that
you and I are first cousins.

776
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,535
Oh, my God, you guys.
This is aws.

777
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:33,904
Nick: He looks like
a preppie braveheart.

778
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:36,807
I found this photo
after my mother died.

779
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,745
Both: Great white buffalo.

780
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,046
Great white buffalo.

781
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:45,882
- Both: Great white buffalo.
- Great white buffalo.

782
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:47,584
Great white buffalo. Yeah.

783
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,086
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

784
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:52,089
So this is him, right?
This is my dad?

785
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:53,223
So you never met him?

786
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:55,058
No, they broke up
before I was even born.

787
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,093
Oh.

788
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:58,428
But you guys can introduce us.

789
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,099
Yeah. See, the thing about
that is, it's complicated.

790
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,601
Do you guys ever feel like

791
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,570
everything happens
for a reason?

792
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:07,938
- Yes.
- No.

793
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,607
Call it destiny,
or predestiny.

794
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,275
I think it's "Predestination."

795
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,411
No, it's predestiny.
I read a book.

796
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:15,645
Uh, was that book
a dictionary?

797
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,614
<i>No, it was a book
called predestiny.</i>

798
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,249
Okay, I don't
really give a shit.

799
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,418
With predestiny, it dictates

800
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,954
that there is a force or
something holding the strings

801
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,922
and setting everything up

802
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:28,992
just so they can be
knocked down perfectly

803
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,194
into

804
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,300
place.

805
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,769
I can't! I can't do it!
I gotta go. Let's go.

806
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,338
- Jacob: Sorry.
- Sorry, bro, we gotta go.

807
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,772
Nice skirt, by the way.

808
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:45,475
- Thank you.
- Jill: I have the dress.

809
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:46,810
Wait, who said anything
about a dress?

810
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,212
I certainly didn't say
anything about the dress.

811
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:50,680
Oh.

812
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,616
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
that Adam had guests.

813
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:53,984
- Hey, babe.
- Hi.

814
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:57,154
Guys, meet Jill.
Jill, meet the guys.

815
00:35:57,156 --> 00:35:59,122
We're getting married
this weekend.

816
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:02,292
Uh, me and Jill,
not me and you guys.

817
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:04,494
Oh, stop it. You're gonna make
milk come out of my nose.

818
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,530
- Milk? What milk?
- I had milk earlier.

819
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:07,597
Oh.

820
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,200
Are you Nick Webber?

821
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:11,668
Yes. Yes, I am.

822
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,304
Would you please do
the Webber Strut?

823
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:15,639
The Webber...

824
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:17,974
Come on, you know it.
He wants us to do it.

825
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:19,142
I think so.

826
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:21,678
Both: Everybody,
strut, strut, strut, strut.

827
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
- Stop that.
- Strut, strut, strut...

828
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:26,483
Wow, they're really good
at your dance.

829
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:29,986
Your poor man's macarena
that you are very famous for.

830
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:31,021
<i>♪ Everybody do the... ♪</i>

831
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,889
they're, like,
picking dicks out of a tree.

832
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:34,357
It looks like dick-picking.

833
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,327
And for the record,
I still like your music.

834
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:39,396
I mean, I know you've fallen
on hard times.

835
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:40,530
Hard times?

836
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,399
You're so poor now,
but I really like you still.

837
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:44,000
What do you mean, poor?

838
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:45,902
- Oh, my God, that's the one.
- That's the one?

839
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:47,170
- That is the one.
- (Sighs)

840
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:49,839
Honey, we found
our mini-cake bites.

841
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:51,007
- Phew!
- Guys!

842
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:52,842
We found our mini-cake bites.

843
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:53,910
What?

844
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,045
Oh, I didn't tell you.

845
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,013
- Jacob is my cousin.
- No.

846
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:59,416
- And Uncle Lou...
- Don't you ever call me that.

847
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:01,384
- ...is my Uncle.
- What?

848
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:04,854
And they came here in a, uh...
What was it?

849
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,223
Both: Hot Tub Time Machine.

850
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:07,357
That's right.

851
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,692
Oh, okay.

852
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:11,428
So I guess you came here in
a hot tub time machine, too.

853
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,398
Listen.

854
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,036
- They're looking for my dad.
- What?

855
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:22,205
- You have to go with them.
- Uh...

856
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:23,540
Would you guys mind?

857
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:25,041
It would be really,
really great

858
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,443
to have my father
at the wedding.

859
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:27,577
Fuck that. Fuck that.

860
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,446
No way in hell.
No way in hell.

861
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:31,047
You gotta let Adam go.

862
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:33,049
I mean, this is exactly the
sort of thing that he needs.

863
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:34,618
We've been together
for 10 years.

864
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,919
He hardly ever goes out.

865
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,454
He didn't even have
a bachelor party.

866
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:38,955
You're making me
seem a little stiff.

867
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,257
Right.

868
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:43,226
All right. Well, you have fun
and make good choices.

869
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:45,128
- You're my best choice.
- You're my best choice.

870
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,797
- No, you're my best choice.
- You're my bestest choice.

871
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:49,399
No, you're my best choice!

872
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:50,900
Both: You're my best choice!

873
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:53,470
You're... My... Best... Choice.

874
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:55,639
- The fuck?
- Yeah, seriously.

875
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:57,474
Guys, I'll be there
in one second.

876
00:37:57,476 --> 00:38:00,644
Both:
You're... My... Best... Choice.

877
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:04,214
Uh, so you guys are my dad's
full-on bros, huh?

878
00:38:04,216 --> 00:38:05,782
I always wondered
what my dad's full-on bros

879
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,785
would be like and now...
Now I totally know.

880
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,854
'Cause we're getting some
serious hang-time.

881
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,290
Hey.

882
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:16,793
You know what,
I feel like we are going
to have an unforgettably...

883
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,795
Dude, where the fuck
are we going?

884
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,297
Oh. Well, my mom used
to live near here,

885
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:22,332
so I figured we'd go
by her old building

886
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:23,800
and see if we can find a clue.

887
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,069
Okay! Well, there's
a 50-50 chance I might

888
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:27,304
murder your dad,

889
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:29,572
so if you have a reunion
speech, keep it tight.

890
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:31,207
- Nick: Whoa!
- Oh, shit!

891
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,310
Wassup, man?

892
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:35,745
No, no, no, no, no.

893
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:37,480
There's no one
driving that car.

894
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,920
Yeah, it's a smart car.

895
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:46,489
- Yeah, I can see that.
- No, it's a smart car.

896
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,792
- It's self-driving.
- What?

897
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:49,993
That's awesome!

898
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,761
Now, see, this is that future
shit I'm talking about.

899
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:53,263
How much that set you back?

900
00:38:53,265 --> 00:38:55,265
You guys are hilarious.

901
00:38:55,267 --> 00:38:57,634
I don't own it.
I mean, no one does.

902
00:38:57,636 --> 00:38:59,035
You need a car, one shows up.

903
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:00,170
Really?

904
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,472
You're a wonderful car
and I appreciate you.

905
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:03,606
(Car beeps)

906
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:04,841
Come on.

907
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,610
(Stammers) So, this car
runs on feelings.

908
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:09,679
Yeah, I guess a six-year-old
would say that.

909
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:11,715
- Oh?
- Nick: Burn.

910
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:13,783
Really?
Would a six-year-old say that?

911
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,618
(Car revs)

912
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,021
- What the fuck was that?
- Revved up on you.

913
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:20,123
- Did he just rev up on me?
- He sure did.

914
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:22,792
Hey! What's up?
You got a problem with me?

915
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:26,796
You know what? I'll give you
the first punch, huh?
Go ahead.

916
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:29,299
Go ahead! Hit me!

917
00:39:29,301 --> 00:39:30,533
Come on!

918
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:31,668
You're not a good car!

919
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,638
You're not smart!
You're just a car!

920
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,975
Okay. I don't think
it actually works that way.

921
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,577
Like, you can't
hurt its feelings.

922
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:41,678
You're a wonderful car
and I appreciate you.

923
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,746
(Beeps)

924
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:43,913
Well, guess what?

925
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:46,416
You can hurt my feelings,
okay?

926
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:48,351
- What?
- I'm walking.

927
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:49,986
(Car revs)

928
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,322
- Is he always like this?
- Pretty much.

929
00:39:52,324 --> 00:39:54,391
Does he have, like,
emotional problems?

930
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:55,725
He's got a real serious
drug problem.

931
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,160
He got shot last night.

932
00:39:57,162 --> 00:39:59,229
- He's got that runt ball.
- His son hates him.

933
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:00,663
That's fair to say, right?

934
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:02,465
Yeah, yeah. He's a monster.

935
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,834
I'd like to help him.

936
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:06,469
(Both laughing)

937
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:16,012
Oh, hey, I'm sure you're sick
of this, but,

938
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:17,614
will you sign my dick pad?

939
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:18,748
(Woman moaning)

940
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,917
Jacob: Oh, you put your dick
in there!

941
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,352
Adam: It's a genius invention.

942
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:24,254
I know, okay? I know.

943
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:27,190
You put your whole mouth
inside your son's
jerk-off machine.

944
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:29,426
What does your son's penis
taste like?

945
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,194
Goddamn you.

946
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:32,762
Was it delicious?

947
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,697
Oh, hey, a friend of mine's
some sort a big shot

948
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:37,434
over at lougle. Brad syed?
He's coming to my wedding.

949
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:39,102
- Brad?
- Hey.

950
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:42,205
You guys should absolutely
come to my wedding.

951
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:46,276
Jacob: Oh, man, I wish we
could, but we're doing, uh...

952
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:48,178
Motherfucker!

953
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,114
Gary Winkle.

954
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,849
(All gasp)

955
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:54,884
(Gun shot)

956
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,393
Fuck him in the face.
Right in the fucking face.

957
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:05,228
It's not about money,
it's about making money.

958
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,796
- Oh! Look who it...
- (Grunts)

959
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,132
- Ah!
- How are you rich, huh?

960
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,468
How the fuck are you rich?

961
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,102
- Oh, Lou...
- You killed me!

962
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:15,271
I'm going to kill you before
you can kill me again!

963
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:16,806
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa...

964
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:21,377
That's hilarious.
Why would I kill you?
I love you, man.

965
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:22,912
What?

966
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:25,815
Okay, okay, okay.
All right. I'm fine.

967
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:29,252
You not buying that land
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

968
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:30,920
Because when Hurricane Beth
came through

969
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:32,989
and destroyed half
the Waterfront... (Exhales)

970
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:36,392
It turned this worthless piece
of dirt into a gold mine.

971
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:37,827
What?

972
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,429
So you didn't murder me?

973
00:41:39,431 --> 00:41:42,732
What are you talking about?
I love you, man. (Chuckles)

974
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,102
So, are you boys coming up
or what?

975
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:48,771
It's not a party unless
it's a Gary Winkle party.

976
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:50,807
At Gary Winkle's

977
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:52,342
the wink.

978
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,677
- What are you doing?
- It's a double wink.

979
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,845
Ah, technically,
that's more of a blink.

980
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,714
- That's a blink.
- You can't wink, can you?

981
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:59,349
(Scoffs) Of course I can wink.

982
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:00,416
Prove it.

983
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,686
Yeah.

984
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,488
Let me do this. Hold on.

985
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,170
Let me hold this open.
I'll hold this open.

986
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,259
Now do it.

987
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,127
Both: See?

988
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:12,362
Can we go
to the fuckin' party now?

989
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:13,863
(Dance music playing)

990
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,542
Welcome to the wink!

991
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:27,944
Hey, jugglers, give my boys
anything they want...

992
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,480
From that shelf down.

993
00:42:30,482 --> 00:42:32,815
- Lou, what are we doing here?
- You know.

994
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:34,651
Winkle is not the killer.
We gotta go.

995
00:42:34,653 --> 00:42:36,085
I don't care, 'cause there's
cocaine right there.

996
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:37,487
Didn't you see the cocaine?
Look, look, look.

997
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:38,888
I see the cocaine. So what?

998
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,657
Well, I'm going to do that.
So first... and then...

999
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:42,492
Look, I'm not flickering.
Am I flickering?

1000
00:42:42,494 --> 00:42:44,060
You cannot say
that I'm flickering.

1001
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,361
We're on a mission
to save your life.

1002
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:47,163
You think I don't want to roll
my dick around some cocaine,

1003
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:48,364
- and get titty-slapped?
- Okay.

1004
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:50,733
Pop some bottles?
Do some crazy future shit?

1005
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,035
I'm trying to keep you
from flickering.

1006
00:42:52,037 --> 00:42:53,202
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Good talk.

1007
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:55,905
Thank you. And popping
bottles, that's old school.

1008
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,240
You bringing that back?

1009
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:58,408
- Yeah.
- (Chuckles)

1010
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,043
I like that. I like you.

1011
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:01,144
(Sighs)

1012
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,579
Uh-oh.

1013
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:04,581
What are these? I don't care.

1014
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,449
Oh. So, Nick, listen,
I was so sorry

1015
00:43:06,451 --> 00:43:08,084
to hear about
you and Courtney.

1016
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,520
- What do you mean?
- Ah.

1017
00:43:10,522 --> 00:43:12,855
Gotcha.
Forget I even brought it up.

1018
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:14,524
No, no, no, really,
what do you mean?

1019
00:43:14,526 --> 00:43:16,259
I hear you
loud and clear, man.

1020
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,861
I don't think
you hear me at all.

1021
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:20,263
Hey, Sophie!

1022
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,098
There you are.

1023
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,570
I have a surprise for you.

1024
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:28,871
Oh. Uh...

1025
00:43:28,873 --> 00:43:31,608
Sophie has a surprise for me.

1026
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:32,809
Bye, dude!

1027
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,280
I'll take a room-temperature
almond milk, please.

1028
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:40,617
No, actually, I'll get
a Tangerine Margarita.

1029
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:45,955
I'll just take an Apricot
sliced into fours. And a Kiwi.

1030
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,625
Do you have Kiwi?
I'll take a Kiwi, sliced up.

1031
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:50,293
A banana thrown in there.

1032
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:51,995
You know what?
Dealer's choice.

1033
00:43:51,997 --> 00:43:53,196
Just a fruit salad.

1034
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,068
Should we go
somewhere more private?

1035
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,470
(Laughs)

1036
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,805
Jacob Dorchen wants privacy.

1037
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,674
That's so 2018.

1038
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:05,808
Right, right.

1039
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,144
No. Get that out of here.

1040
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,813
I mean, I wouldn't mind
a little something.

1041
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,650
Remember, we agreed?

1042
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:17,487
Look at your dad.
You're not going down
that road anymore.

1043
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:23,459
Oh, God, I'm so good at that!

1044
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:25,261
(Grunts)
Yes!

1045
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:27,096
(Vocalizing) It's Satan.

1046
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:28,531
Like, I'll finger your dog,
I don't care.

1047
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:30,333
As a joke! As a joke!

1048
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,668
I have some advice for you.

1049
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,936
If you don't want to be
considered a sex offender,

1050
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:36,506
don't take a shit in a sandbox

1051
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:38,508
that happens to be
in a playground.

1052
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,510
Okay? Don't do it.
'Cause guess what?

1053
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:43,613
You have two things, a record
and a fucking nickname.

1054
00:44:43,615 --> 00:44:46,849
I know it's a potentially
risky move... wedding sorbet!

1055
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,451
As a palate cleanser,
of course.

1056
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:49,686
I mean, I'm not insane.

1057
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:52,188
Oh, my God! Fuckin' a!
You're Nick Webber, man!

1058
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,291
Let's take a picture!
I can't believe it's you, man.

1059
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:56,392
I'm gonna send this
to everyone.

1060
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:58,194
I'm gonna get, like,
a billion views!

1061
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,496
I remember when I first heard
that stupid song. I was like,

1062
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:03,299
"man, that song is so dumb."

1063
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:04,701
Do the Strut.

1064
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:05,968
- Do the Strut.
- No, I'm good.

1065
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,036
You won't do the fucking song?

1066
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,171
You want to see the strut?

1067
00:45:08,173 --> 00:45:09,372
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1068
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:11,474
Dj: (Laughs) Hey, yo!
Check this out!

1069
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:14,143
Nick Webber's in the house,
so get ready for the original

1070
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:16,212
- Webber Strut!
- (All cheering)

1071
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,851
Before that, let's back it up.

1072
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:24,721
Six years ago,
see where it all began.

1073
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:27,890
<i>I made a lot of mistakes.
I've taken advantage.</i>

1074
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,560
<i>And now I'm ready
to be original.</i>

1075
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:33,229
<i>This is dedicated to those
who never got to be,</i>

1076
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,630
<i>because of me.</i>

1077
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,402
<i>♪ Strut to the time
of the clock</i>

1078
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:43,172
<i>♪ It's midnight
everybody strut right now</i>

1079
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:45,074
<i>♪ Nick Webber
Nick Webber</i>

1080
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,909
<i>♪ you don't know
but you think you know</i>

1081
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,245
<i>♪ Nick Webber
Nick Webber</i>

1082
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,747
<i>♪ You don't know, but you will</i>

1083
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:52,582
<i>♪ Everybody do the

1084
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:54,884

1085
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:57,019

1086
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:59,088

1087
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,356
<i>♪ Everybody do the ♪</i>

1088
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:09,732
(gasps) Oh!

1089
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:13,636
Oh, this... this room is
so much better
than the other room.

1090
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,341
What?

1091
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,646
No!

1092
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:25,381
Look at him go.
Chip off the old block.

1093
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,750
(Laughs)

1094
00:46:27,752 --> 00:46:32,255
Okay, be nice. Be nice.
Be nice. Be nice.
Be nice. Be nice. Be nice!

1095
00:46:32,257 --> 00:46:34,490
Hmm. Son!

1096
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:38,394
Hey! What a coincidence.

1097
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:41,597
Wondered where you ran off to,
but here you are.

1098
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,333
Who let you in here?
Would you go
find your murderer?

1099
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:48,271
Think your old man can
get in on a little
of this action, or...

1100
00:46:48,273 --> 00:46:51,808
-This is...
This is a private party.
-This one's mine.

1101
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,944
- Jacob: What?
- Yes! See? Ha! Still got it.

1102
00:46:54,946 --> 00:46:57,146
What are the...
What are the house rules here?

1103
00:46:57,148 --> 00:47:00,283
I just want to know
what to do. Don't want
to break any rules,

1104
00:47:00,285 --> 00:47:02,852
get chucked out right away,
you know?
That'd be fucked up.

1105
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:04,387
Touch me, you filthy vagrant.

1106
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,722
(Exhales deeply)

1107
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,927
Jacob: (Laughs)
Oh, wait, wait,
what was that?

1108
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:12,628
Nothing. What was that?
It wasn't anything.

1109
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:15,198
- You just flickered.
- Flickered? No, I didn't.

1110
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,800
-How did you do that?
-He's threatening
his own existence.

1111
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:21,003
Lou, you can't be here
'cause you're jeopardizing
your future.

1112
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,872
You mind your own
fucking beeswax, huh.

1113
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:24,540
Whatever. I'm over this.

1114
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:27,210
No... no!

1115
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:29,312
No! No!

1116
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:30,847
(Groans)

1117
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:32,782
Adam: Long story short,

1118
00:47:32,784 --> 00:47:35,351
the caterer did talk us
into the chateaubriand,

1119
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,520
which, you know, I'll admit,
is a sexy side of beef.

1120
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:38,688
Sounds like it.

1121
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:40,356
And I think you know
where I'm going with this.

1122
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,325
- You thought wrong.
- Horseradish station.

1123
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:44,327
That's right. We're gonna have
the white and the reds,

1124
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:46,996
separate service,
different intensity.

1125
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:48,698
It's gonna be great...

1126
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,668
Wait a second. Nick?
You should play our wedding.

1127
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:55,037
People would love to see
the strut in person.

1128
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,505
I'm sure they would.

1129
00:47:56,507 --> 00:47:58,174
Hey, what do you guys
want from the party tray?

1130
00:47:58,176 --> 00:47:59,508
Me? Oh, uh...

1131
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:02,011
I don't know.
I'm getting married tomorrow,

1132
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:03,713
so I'm really trying
to take it easy.

1133
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:05,381
Yeah, you're getting married
for the rest of your life,

1134
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:08,417
so why have any fun
tonight at all?

1135
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:10,720
- Oh!
- Yeah.

1136
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:12,855
- Uncle Lou is right.
- Don't call me that.

1137
00:48:12,857 --> 00:48:14,724
Give me the craziest thing
you got.

1138
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:17,193
Someone sounds like he wants
the electric ladybug.

1139
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:18,527
Ooh, the electric...

1140
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:22,732
-What, uh... I'm sorry,
what exactly is that?
-(Woman shushes)

1141
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:24,567
Don't take it off
for 24 hours.

1142
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:27,270
Why can't I take it off
for 24 hours?

1143
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,742
Yeah. What's so funny?

1144
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:35,211
Relax. Relax.
It's just like baby aspirin.

1145
00:48:35,213 --> 00:48:38,447
Except more of
a super-high intensity
psychotropic drug trip.

1146
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:40,917
(Chuckling)

1147
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,887
(Bell chiming)

1148
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:46,622
I promise you,

1149
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:49,158
you're not gonna like this.

1150
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,016
(In distorted voice)
Bye-bye.

1151
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:55,631
(Chiming continues)

1152
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:58,567
Horseradish.

1153
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:00,269
(Club music playing)

1154
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,146
(Laughs)

1155
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:14,650
(Instrumental
piano music playing)

1156
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,253
- (Phone beeping)
- Hello.

1157
00:49:17,255 --> 00:49:19,121
<i>I'm a God!</i>

1158
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,190
<i>I'm a fucking God!</i>

1159
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:22,959
<i>Whoo!</i>

1160
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:44,847
Oh!

1161
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:49,485
(Laughing)

1162
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,155
(Screaming)

1163
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,317
Shit.

1164
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:24,687
Not in the dumpster.
I owe you 50 bucks.

1165
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,255
Adam: Hey, lick my pussy.

1166
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:31,027
Just kidding, guys.
I'm up here. What's up?

1167
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:32,328
Jacob: What are you doing
up there?

1168
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,830
Why are you down there,
stupid fuck?

1169
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:36,732
You guys, last night,

1170
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,734
my eyes

1171
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:40,669
opened.

1172
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:42,004
- Okay.
- I'm telling you, you guys,

1173
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:43,339
you got to get up here.

1174
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:45,841
I mean, the way the sun
is just dancing off
these leaves...

1175
00:50:45,843 --> 00:50:47,376
Mr. Webber.

1176
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:49,912
Hi. I'm from <i> Choozy Doozy.</i>
I'm here to take you
to the show.

1177
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:51,514
Show?

1178
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:52,681
- (Chuckles)
- Yeah.

1179
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:54,050
Nick: How about that?

1180
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:58,354
Nick Webber has a show
in 2025. Still got it!

1181
00:50:58,356 --> 00:51:00,056
Right, but, I mean,
we can't go

1182
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:01,724
because we have
to solve his murder.

1183
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:04,060
Come on! Look.
Hey, not flickering.

1184
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:06,028
Maybe it's a lead.
It's a fun lead.

1185
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:08,064
Jacob: Until somebody goes
back in time and kills you.

1186
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:09,532
I can't miss my gig.

1187
00:51:09,534 --> 00:51:12,068
Okay, <i> Choozy Doozy</i>
is my favorite show.

1188
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,702
Wait, how did you find us?

1189
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,371
I just go where
the cars take me.

1190
00:51:15,373 --> 00:51:16,872
Adam: Okay, I'm coming down.

1191
00:51:16,874 --> 00:51:18,574
You think I can make
that dumpster, guys?

1192
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,042
- No.
- No.

1193
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:21,410
Yeah, I think
I can probably make it.

1194
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,212
Yes, yes, yes, yes! Come on!

1195
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:24,747
Yeah, I think so, too, Lou.
Thanks.

1196
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:25,881
- Adam, stay right there.
- Stop. Adam!

1197
00:51:25,883 --> 00:51:27,383
- Come on!
- Nick: Baby Adam!

1198
00:51:27,385 --> 00:51:29,418
- (Shushes) You can!
- Stop, Lou!

1199
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,719
Here I go. I'm gonna jump.

1200
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:32,421
(All speaking indistinctly)

1201
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:33,823
- Whoo!
- Lou: Holy fuck...

1202
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:35,925
Got you!

1203
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:39,195
Jacob:
That was fucking awesome!

1204
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:41,397
- Oh, my God!
- How did you even do that?

1205
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:43,899
I'm strong as fuck.

1206
00:51:43,901 --> 00:51:46,068
Male announcer: <i>Get ready
for Mischief, Mayhem,</i>

1207
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,270
<i>plenty of truths
and more than one dare!</i>

1208
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:52,074
<i>This is
celebrity Choozy Doozy!</i>

1209
00:51:52,076 --> 00:51:55,945
<i>Now, please welcome back</i>
<i>the host of the show,</i>
<i>Brett Mcshaussey!</i>

1210
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:57,279
(Audience cheering)

1211
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,419
Thank you very much
for that, gill!

1212
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:06,956
Welcome to our show!
We got a very, very exciting

1213
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,958
show planned for you tonight.

1214
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:13,262
Please help me welcome back to
the stage, musical sensation,

1215
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:15,331
- Nick Webber!
- (Audience cheering)

1216
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,305
(Phone beeping)

1217
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,440
Hello?

1218
00:52:24,442 --> 00:52:28,611
(Softly) Hey, honey,
guess where I am. Just guess.

1219
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:30,813
Okay, shut up.
I'm at <i> Choozy Doozy.</i>

1220
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:32,448
<i>Where have you been?</i>

1221
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,617
I tried to call you, like,
a hundred times.

1222
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:36,986
What was with that crazy
phone call last night?

1223
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:38,954
<i>Crazy call? What do you mean?</i>

1224
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:40,789
You don't remember calling me

1225
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,625
and telling me that
you were a God?

1226
00:52:42,627 --> 00:52:45,294
No. Does that sound like me?

1227
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:47,997
Listen, I had the most
amazing night.

1228
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:52,801
I did everything. (Stutters)
I punched a man in the face.

1229
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:54,670
Just walked up to him.
(Clicks tongue)

1230
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,505
Just punched him with my fist.

1231
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,240
<i>I felt like an Ape.</i>

1232
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:00,176
<i>Like an Ape.</i>

1233
00:53:00,178 --> 00:53:03,345
I did eskimo kisses
with this beautiful woman.

1234
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:04,980
What are you talking about?

1235
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:06,615
<i>Honey, have you ever felt</i>

1236
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:09,151
that everything that
you've experienced and said

1237
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:11,520
up to this point
is just a fraud?

1238
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:12,988
Excuse me?

1239
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,823
No. Okay,
"Fraud" is too strong a word.

1240
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:16,058
It's more like

1241
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,093
a lie.

1242
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,964
"Lie" is actually...
It's not right, either.

1243
00:53:21,966 --> 00:53:24,667
It's kind of
a hard concept to...

1244
00:53:24,669 --> 00:53:27,503
Okay, bye, honey.

1245
00:53:27,505 --> 00:53:30,339
All right, that went well.
That went really well.

1246
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:33,209
Our studio audience
will have the opportunity

1247
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:36,679
to challenge you
to specific tasks.

1248
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:39,715
The best idea shall prevail.

1249
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:42,017
Because this is...

1250
00:53:42,019 --> 00:53:45,187
All: <i> Celebrity Choozy Doozy!</i>

1251
00:53:45,189 --> 00:53:46,822
What is that, exactly?

1252
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:48,490
Let me hear some ideas
from the audience.

1253
00:53:48,492 --> 00:53:50,359
Come on!
We want some new ideas!

1254
00:53:50,361 --> 00:53:51,527
Woman:
Eat a bunch of waffles!

1255
00:53:51,529 --> 00:53:53,562
Eat a bunch of waffles.
Very, very nice choice.

1256
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:54,863
Man 1: Juggle Knives!

1257
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:56,232
Ooh! Very scary!

1258
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:58,034
He could lose an arm!
That happened last week.

1259
00:53:58,501 --> 00:53:59,568
Man 2: Swallow a watch!

1260
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:01,704
Can you swallow a watch, Nick?

1261
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:03,205
I hope not.

1262
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:05,341
Fuck a dude!

1263
00:54:05,343 --> 00:54:06,675
- Whoa!
- (Audience cheering)

1264
00:54:06,677 --> 00:54:07,743
Yeah!

1265
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,548
Say some more stuff!
Say something else!

1266
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,217
Now, remember, folks, when you
see something you like,

1267
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:16,585
you make your selection,

1268
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:19,421
-and it'll show up here
on the board.
-(Device beeping)

1269
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,090
Uh, I don't want
to fuck a dude.

1270
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:22,291
Ah, you're adorable.

1271
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,062
This is the best day
of my life.

1272
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:28,764
What the fuck's wrong
with everybody?

1273
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:32,501
Waffles, waffles.
It's a neck-and-neck with...

1274
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,738
Oh! Oh, well...

1275
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,106
(Exclaims)

1276
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,741
Look at that.

1277
00:54:38,743 --> 00:54:40,075
Oh, hell, no!

1278
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:41,744
Brett: You just got
very lucky, my friend,

1279
00:54:41,746 --> 00:54:45,114
because you were almost
about to have to eat
a whole bunch of waffles!

1280
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:46,248
I'm willing to do that.

1281
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,616
I'm willing...
I'll eat the waffles.

1282
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:49,118
Okay, now...

1283
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:53,422
Who had the idea of this man
fornicating with a gentleman?

1284
00:54:53,424 --> 00:54:55,591
Over here! This guy!

1285
00:54:55,593 --> 00:54:57,126
What's your name, sir?

1286
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:58,727
Lou Dorchen.

1287
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:01,964
Well, Lou, as you know,
with <i> Choozy Doozy...</i>

1288
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:04,767
All: You choose it,
you dooze it!

1289
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:06,835
You choose it, you dooze it.

1290
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,276
I'm sorry. I dooze what now?

1291
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:15,611
Oh, shit!

1292
00:55:15,613 --> 00:55:17,146
- Come on up here, Lou!
- Lou: This is crazy!

1293
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,881
Stop smiling!

1294
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,050
(Cheering)

1295
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:22,918
And, we're back with

1296
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,487
the <i> celebrity Choozy Doozy</i>
challenge round.

1297
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:29,158
We have Nick Webber along
with his pal, Lou Dorchen!

1298
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,460
What exactly is this?

1299
00:55:31,462 --> 00:55:33,796
It's the number one show
on TV.

1300
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:36,031
Okay, load 'em up!

1301
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:42,504
What the fuck?

1302
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,006
I don't think this is real.

1303
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:45,574
(All laughing)

1304
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:49,445
Yeah. It's like <i> Lawnmower Man.</i>

1305
00:55:49,447 --> 00:55:51,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1306
00:55:51,182 --> 00:55:52,481
Just like <i> Lawnmower Man,</i>

1307
00:55:52,483 --> 00:55:54,149
except, you know,
we're supposed to fuck.

1308
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:56,685
Yeah, well,
that's not going to happen.

1309
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:57,853
(Audience booing)

1310
00:55:57,855 --> 00:55:59,321
Bring me the thing!

1311
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:00,656
Well...

1312
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:02,725
I'm glad
we're on the same page.

1313
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:04,693
(Electricity buzzing)

1314
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:05,928
What's going on? Lou!

1315
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:08,864
Oh...

1316
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,667
(Gasping)

1317
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:12,868
- (Buzzing)
- (Groans)

1318
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:17,172
Motherfucker!

1319
00:56:17,174 --> 00:56:18,707
This is getting a little dark.

1320
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:20,342
Dark? What do you mean?

1321
00:56:20,344 --> 00:56:21,844
Okay, if this is the most
popular show,

1322
00:56:21,846 --> 00:56:23,212
give me some
of the other shows?

1323
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:24,880
Yeah, of course.
There's <i> Toddler in the wild,</i>

1324
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:26,148
<i>there's mommy, I'm drowning,</i>

1325
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:27,683
<i>there's daddy,
where are you going?</i>

1326
00:56:27,685 --> 00:56:30,519
There's, um,
<i>Building Explosion.</i>

1327
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:31,887
<i>- Building Explosion?</i>
- Yeah, <i> Building Explosion.</i>

1328
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,723
It just shows big buildings
falling down, and...

1329
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:37,192
Kids, like, trapped
in the basement,
and the building falls,

1330
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:39,027
and they're like,
"Ma, get me out of here."

1331
00:56:39,029 --> 00:56:41,163
And it shows them how
to get out in an emergency,

1332
00:56:41,165 --> 00:56:43,432
but also tells them
when to give up.

1333
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:44,867
Ah!

1334
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:47,236
Bing bong! What's the delay?

1335
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:49,037
(Groans) Hey.

1336
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:53,409
Hey. There's something
trying to kill us here.

1337
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:56,712
That's 10,000 volts
of electricity
coursing through the suits

1338
00:56:56,714 --> 00:56:59,248
that you're wearing
back here in the studio!

1339
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:02,217
Every week,
it's the same goddamn thing.

1340
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:05,053
It's guy on guy, girl on girl.

1341
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:07,556
Sometimes it's even
guy on girl.

1342
00:57:07,558 --> 00:57:08,891
(All laughing)

1343
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:12,094
What is the big deal
with the two of you boys
sleeping together?

1344
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:15,264
You're acting like it's 2010,
for Christ's sakes.

1345
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:19,268
Now we got a show to do, boys!
So start fucking!

1346
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:22,237
Dude, is there, like,
a stage manager? They're
going to kill these guys.

1347
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:24,807
Hey, I'm sorry.
Look, if you're going
to sit next to me,

1348
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:28,644
I need to know right now.
Do you have a problem
with this show?

1349
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:30,479
Well, yeah, clearly
I have a problem
with the show.

1350
00:57:30,481 --> 00:57:33,949
-I mean, look,
this is grotesque.
-Jacob, this is a great show.

1351
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:38,086
This is the number one show
in the nation. This is a show
that families enjoy, okay?

1352
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:40,122
- This is a family show?
- Absolutely.

1353
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:43,258
-Like it's on at, like, 8:00?
-It's on at 7:00
on Sunday nights

1354
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,994
against <i> butthole nation,</i>
and it always wins.

1355
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:47,996
(Sighs)

1356
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:54,336
Classic Lou.

1357
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,206
(Audience laughing)

1358
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:00,576
Okay.

1359
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:03,345
(Sighs)

1360
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,748
Okay. (Grunts)

1361
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:09,284
I'm sorry, Lou.

1362
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:12,120
I know you are, buddy! I know!

1363
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:13,822
I know. I love you, man!

1364
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,457
Don't say that!
I don't wanna have

1365
00:58:15,459 --> 00:58:16,959
an emotional connection
to this moment!

1366
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:19,661
What... oh, God forbid
a couple of friends

1367
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:22,965
can't express
their brotherly love for
each other! I love you.

1368
00:58:22,967 --> 00:58:24,500
I told you to
stop saying that!

1369
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:27,035
Lou: I'm so sorry!

1370
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:29,137
So there are
no more sex taboos?

1371
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:32,574
Well, I guess bestiality,
but only from a community
property perspective.

1372
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:35,978
What do you...
What do you mean?

1373
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,846
What, you don't remember
<i>Llama v. Ferguson?</i>

1374
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,148
Guy tries to divorce a Llama,
and the land is in dispute

1375
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,884
because the llama
needs to graze?

1376
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,721
But people still
eat animals, right?

1377
00:58:45,723 --> 00:58:48,390
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
And animals eat people.
It's all the same.

1378
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,896
You got a tuft of hair
coming out your crack.

1379
00:58:53,898 --> 00:58:55,531
Don't fuckin' worry
about it, okay?

1380
00:58:55,533 --> 00:58:57,666
I'll get your
grooming tips later.

1381
00:58:57,668 --> 00:58:59,134
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

1382
00:58:59,136 --> 00:59:00,903
Okay. I love you.

1383
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:03,972
All right! Put it in slow!

1384
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:06,141
Really slow!

1385
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:07,809
One...

1386
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,578
Two...

1387
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,847
- Take that dick.
- What the fuck?

1388
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:13,181
Come on!
It's just something I say.

1389
00:59:13,183 --> 00:59:14,316
"Take that dick"?

1390
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,152
Oh, wait, hold on!
Stop, stop, stop!

1391
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:22,524
Oh!

1392
00:59:22,526 --> 00:59:25,027
Looks like somebody
chose a lifeline!

1393
00:59:25,029 --> 00:59:26,595
Me! Me! I did it! I chose it!

1394
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:28,864
Who will the lucky winner be?

1395
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:30,198
What happens?
Do we get waffles?

1396
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,567
- What happened?
- It's a lifeline,

1397
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:33,268
so the chooser picks
a new doozer.

1398
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:35,103
You gotta choose someone,
Lou.

1399
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:36,605
Nick: Choose waffles.

1400
00:59:36,607 --> 00:59:37,940
(Gasps) Oh.

1401
00:59:37,942 --> 00:59:39,274
Okay, I get it. I get it.

1402
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:40,876
All right. All right. Uh...
(Chuckles)

1403
00:59:40,878 --> 00:59:44,446
Yeah, I know just the guy.
He loves this show.

1404
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:48,116
Oh!

1405
00:59:48,118 --> 00:59:49,785
Oh, no, no, no. I'm...

1406
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:52,521
I'm actually getting married
tonight, so I can't.

1407
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:55,457
It's actually
an issue of fidelity.

1408
00:59:55,459 --> 00:59:56,792
I cannot do this.

1409
00:59:56,794 --> 00:59:58,293
You're a monster, Lou.

1410
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:05,801
What's up?

1411
01:00:05,803 --> 01:00:07,235
Nick: Get ready,
'cause here it comes.

1412
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:08,537
Here what comes?

1413
01:00:08,539 --> 01:00:09,938
(Adam screaming)

1414
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:13,642
<i>That's my butt!</i>

1415
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:15,644
(Laughing)

1416
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:18,714
Oh, wow!
That was good TV.

1417
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:22,818
You know what, Adam,
I thought about it.

1418
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,987
You can call me Uncle Lou now.

1419
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:27,656
Holy shit! Did you see that?

1420
01:00:27,658 --> 01:00:29,591
You're a fucking lunatic!

1421
01:00:29,593 --> 01:00:31,493
- Was that the same car?
- Couldn't be.

1422
01:00:31,495 --> 01:00:34,429
That car tried to
run me down on purpose.
Did you see that?

1423
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,931
(Gasps)

1424
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:37,766
What if that car's
my murderer?

1425
01:00:37,768 --> 01:00:39,501
You were shot in the dick
in the past, remember?

1426
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:41,570
Oh, like that would be
the craziest fucking thing

1427
01:00:41,572 --> 01:00:43,605
that's ever happened to us.
That car's an asshole.

1428
01:00:43,607 --> 01:00:46,842
That car's not an asshole.
You're an asshole.

1429
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:48,944
Whoa. Where'd that come from?

1430
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:52,347
Everything is all about Lou.
No regard for anybody else.

1431
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:54,783
I'm pretty sure that's never
been the case at all, ever.

1432
01:00:54,785 --> 01:00:56,985
Because of you,
Adam just got raped.

1433
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,654
Are we calling it a rape?

1434
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:00,322
Whoa! Nobody got raped.

1435
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:01,957
It felt like kind
of a gray area.

1436
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:03,625
You're a fucking virus, Lou.

1437
01:01:03,627 --> 01:01:05,260
You find a vulnerable host,

1438
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:07,496
and you attach yourself
and you just

1439
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:09,631
- fuck 'em all up.
- Lou: (Scoffs) Okay.

1440
01:01:09,633 --> 01:01:13,535
Okay. Someone needs
to find a chill-out tent.

1441
01:01:13,537 --> 01:01:15,303
Let's get you a comfy couch
and a video game.

1442
01:01:15,305 --> 01:01:18,774
Where does it say in
the <i> Shitty Parents' Handbook</i>
to treat your son like shit?

1443
01:01:18,776 --> 01:01:21,543
Well, if it's the <i> Shitty
Parents' Handbook,</i>
wouldn't it

1444
01:01:21,545 --> 01:01:23,278
be, like, the theme
of the whole book?

1445
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,280
No, he's...
He's right. Wait.

1446
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:28,316
No, no, no, no. It's
a step by step guide for
how to be a shitty parent.

1447
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:30,519
- Exactly.
<i>- Shitty parenting for dummies.</i>

1448
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:33,488
Okay. You're right.
I apologize. I apologize.

1449
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,824
-You were totally wrong.
-No, why would someone
write that book?

1450
01:01:35,826 --> 01:01:40,228
Actually, Nick's idea about
re-titling it <i> shitty parenting</i>
<i>for dummies</i>

1451
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:42,497
is a solid idea,
if you want to use
the metaphor again.

1452
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:44,166
-Lou: It's an impulse buy.
-All right, you know what?
Forget it.

1453
01:01:44,168 --> 01:01:47,169
You're right. That's fair.
It was a misleading title.
But the point is...

1454
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:48,704
Fuck you!

1455
01:01:48,706 --> 01:01:50,972
If they're not gonna say it,
I will.

1456
01:01:50,974 --> 01:01:54,342
I am so tired of solving
your problems.

1457
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:58,013
You wanna stop your murder,
figure it out yourself.
I'm going to Winkle's.

1458
01:01:58,015 --> 01:01:59,715
- Jacob, what the fuck?
- Youngblood!

1459
01:01:59,717 --> 01:02:02,350
No. You know why?
'Cause as long as we're here,

1460
01:02:02,352 --> 01:02:06,188
I'm Jacob fucking Dorchen!
And that means something.

1461
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:08,056
Jacob, come on!

1462
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:09,691
Youngblood,
we got to figure this out.

1463
01:02:09,693 --> 01:02:12,427
Lou: You're the only one
keeping track
of important stuff!

1464
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:14,529
I mean...

1465
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:15,697
You know what?
Fuck it. Fuck it.

1466
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:17,733
Who cares? Who needs him?
I don't need him.

1467
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:19,701
Hey, I'm getting
married today, guys.

1468
01:02:19,703 --> 01:02:21,536
What do you say
we kick this day in the pants

1469
01:02:21,538 --> 01:02:24,539
and get over there early
for some Bloody Mary-Tinis?

1470
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:26,241
I'm sorry. Can I just
get rid of this thing?

1471
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,710
No! She said not
to take it off for 24 hours.

1472
01:02:28,712 --> 01:02:30,879
- Or what?
- I don't know.

1473
01:02:30,881 --> 01:02:32,347
Yeah, exactly. If I had
a dime for every time

1474
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:34,850
I did something
a cocktail waitress told me
not to do,

1475
01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:36,118
I'd be rich. Look.

1476
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:41,256
Oh! (Chuckles)

1477
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:43,725
Oh, my God, the cocktail
waitress was wrong.

1478
01:02:43,727 --> 01:02:46,228
Sorry, my mistake.
I should listen to you
more often, Lou.

1479
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,395
- All right.
- (Sighs)

1480
01:02:47,397 --> 01:02:49,064
You just learned
a valuable life lesson.

1481
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:50,132
I did.

1482
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:53,769
Guys?

1483
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:55,637
Come on.

1484
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,140
Mm...

1485
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,012
Ew, God. So...

1486
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:06,314
(Gasping)

1487
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,817
- 911, right?
- Yeah.

1488
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,626
(Retches)

1489
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:19,594
Lou: Ugh.

1490
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:21,930
Fucking disgusting, dude!

1491
01:03:21,932 --> 01:03:24,432
Okay, you're sick.
You made your point.

1492
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:26,334
Come on, Lou,
you know he can't help it.

1493
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:27,903
You okay, buddy?

1494
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:29,104
(Gurgles)

1495
01:03:29,106 --> 01:03:31,473
Okay, this is becoming
a bit of a hygiene issue.

1496
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:35,544
All right, let's see what
we have here. Okay, yeah.

1497
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:38,313
Kel.

1498
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:39,948
Come on, really?

1499
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:42,951
Divorced? What the fuck
are you talking about?

1500
01:03:42,953 --> 01:03:44,386
Kelly, we're soulmates.

1501
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,888
Not anymore.

1502
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:51,126
- Mommy?
- No, I'm not your mommy.

1503
01:03:51,128 --> 01:03:54,162
- Homie?
- Yeah, I'm your homie.

1504
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,498
Was it... was it something
you did? If so, I don't care.

1505
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,966
I don't care. I forgive you.

1506
01:03:57,968 --> 01:03:59,501
- Put this in his mouth.
- (Adam groans)

1507
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:02,003
If you don't communicate
with me, I can't fix this!

1508
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,338
You can't fix anything.

1509
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:06,474
Hey, bite down on this.
Good. Okay.

1510
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:08,543
- What's going on?
- Here we go.

1511
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:11,546
Okay.

1512
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:13,849
Oh, that's actually not bad.

1513
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:15,251
You know,
it's, like, kind of sweet.

1514
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,319
What's happening to him?

1515
01:04:17,321 --> 01:04:18,620
Oh, this is totally normal.

1516
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:20,689
The Nanobots are attacking
the Narcotics.

1517
01:04:20,691 --> 01:04:22,457
How long has he been
on heroin?

1518
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:23,825
It was a Ladybug.

1519
01:04:23,827 --> 01:04:26,161
- Wait, the sticker?
- Yeah, on the neck.

1520
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:28,830
Yeah. We normally
give Tylenol for that.

1521
01:04:28,832 --> 01:04:31,666
- I just pumped him full of...
- Narcotic-Seeking Nanobots?

1522
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:33,335
- Yeah.
- Whoops.

1523
01:04:33,337 --> 01:04:35,170
You're a great listener.
I should have married you.

1524
01:04:35,172 --> 01:04:36,771
Lou: Look, Kel,
I'm sorry, okay?

1525
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:39,641
I'm sorry.

1526
01:04:39,643 --> 01:04:40,709
(Adam groans)

1527
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:42,377
Can we just move on?

1528
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,846
I did move on, Lou.
I got clean.

1529
01:04:44,848 --> 01:04:47,048
You're the one who doesn't
have a rock bottom.

1530
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:49,251
I just pray that
there's still hope for Jacob.

1531
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,354
Gary: This ain't a circus!

1532
01:04:52,356 --> 01:04:54,890
Quick juggling
and make some fucking drinks!

1533
01:04:54,892 --> 01:04:56,291
Hey! Jake the snake!

1534
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:58,560
Hey, is it still
day out there?

1535
01:04:58,562 --> 01:05:00,195
Who gives a shit?
What can I get you?

1536
01:05:00,197 --> 01:05:01,730
I'll take everything!

1537
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:02,797
(Chuckles)

1538
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,532
You sure about that?

1539
01:05:04,534 --> 01:05:06,201
'Cause, remember what
happened last time?

1540
01:05:06,203 --> 01:05:07,636
Everything.

1541
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:10,205
Okay.

1542
01:05:10,207 --> 01:05:12,407
All right! Set Mr. Dorchen up
with the usual...

1543
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:15,377
And, you know, call security.

1544
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:17,212
Kelly: The nanobots
can't find any drugs,

1545
01:05:17,214 --> 01:05:18,914
so they're traveling to
the lowest part of his body,

1546
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:20,548
where they'll harden
and expand.

1547
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,884
- His feet?
- In his testicles.

1548
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:25,126
Well, that hardly seems like
the lowest part of his body.

1549
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,390
- Shit!
- What's happening?

1550
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:29,758
Okay. It's now or never.

1551
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,059
Adam: (Stammering)
What are you doing?

1552
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:32,861
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- (Laughs)

1553
01:05:32,863 --> 01:05:33,929
What is that?

1554
01:05:33,931 --> 01:05:35,096
What you gonna
do with that?

1555
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:36,231
Stick him! Stick him!

1556
01:05:36,233 --> 01:05:37,599
(Screaming)

1557
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,502
(Screaming)

1558
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:43,571
(Exclaims) Oh, shit!

1559
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:45,173
(Continues screaming)

1560
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:48,743
That's a lot of juice!

1561
01:05:48,745 --> 01:05:50,745
Okay! Enough!

1562
01:05:50,747 --> 01:05:52,447
Now what's gonna happen,
I'm going to pull this out,

1563
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:53,915
and there might
be some leakage, okay?

1564
01:05:53,917 --> 01:05:55,917
(Stammers) Don't pull it out.
Don't pull it out.

1565
01:05:55,919 --> 01:05:57,879
- I like it where it is.
- Kelly: One, two, three...

1566
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,454
(Adam screaming)

1567
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:01,156
Ha! Ah!

1568
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:05,260
- Lou: Oh, wow! Okay.
- Fuck your ball juice!

1569
01:06:05,262 --> 01:06:06,428
(Spits)

1570
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:09,464
Oh, I walked right
into that one. Literally.

1571
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:12,100
Oh, I don't know
about you guys,
but I feel way better.

1572
01:06:12,102 --> 01:06:14,102
There's definitely
semen in that.

1573
01:06:14,104 --> 01:06:16,604
There's definitely
fucking semen in that.

1574
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:19,507
Did you taste the robots?
They're gritty.

1575
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:25,780
Oh, fucking bottle service.

1576
01:06:25,782 --> 01:06:27,148
- (Grunts)
- Woman: Hey!

1577
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:34,823
Every fucking weekend.

1578
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:36,658
Hey, baby.
(Sniffs)

1579
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:39,494
You're a fuck-up, Jacob.

1580
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,296
Just like your loser dad.

1581
01:06:41,298 --> 01:06:43,698
I'm not anything
like my fucking dad!

1582
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:51,473
No...
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.

1583
01:06:51,475 --> 01:06:52,540
(Groans)

1584
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:54,142
Wait.

1585
01:06:54,144 --> 01:06:55,210
Wait.

1586
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:58,713
I know how this looks.

1587
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:01,383
No. You don't.

1588
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:09,724
You see my son?
Do you know my son?

1589
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:12,360
Jacob!

1590
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:15,430
Has anybody seen
a Grown-Up garbage pail kid?

1591
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:18,500
There's Winkle.

1592
01:07:18,502 --> 01:07:21,169
Gary: I pay you girls
to like me. Hey, smile!

1593
01:07:21,171 --> 01:07:23,171
Hey!

1594
01:07:23,173 --> 01:07:25,373
Uh-oh! Electric Ladybug, huh?

1595
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,208
- Fuck you, dude!
- Yeah.

1596
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,510
Hey, how you doing?

1597
01:07:28,512 --> 01:07:30,211
I'm doing fucking shitty,
Gary.

1598
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:33,348
Still haven't found my killer,
and there's a car trying
to run me down.

1599
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:36,184
I had a passat follow me
around for three weeks
one time.

1600
01:07:36,186 --> 01:07:37,886
Had to buy it rims
to make it go away.

1601
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:39,354
You know what
I'm talking about, huh?

1602
01:07:39,356 --> 01:07:40,422
Where's Jacob?

1603
01:07:40,424 --> 01:07:42,190
Oh, I had to throw him out,
like I always do.

1604
01:07:42,192 --> 01:07:43,491
You know what I mean?

1605
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:45,860
He said something about going
to see his family therapist,

1606
01:07:45,862 --> 01:07:47,295
whoever the fuck that is.

1607
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:52,300
I know where he is.

1608
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:05,947
I'm not that strong.

1609
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:13,455
Hey, son.

1610
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:16,291
It's daddy.

1611
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:24,632
(Sighs)

1612
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:33,741
It's a nice... nice place.

1613
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:35,410
Yeah, yeah.

1614
01:08:35,412 --> 01:08:37,112
I mean, like,
as far as rooms go,

1615
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:38,613
this is one of the biggest.

1616
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:39,881
A great room is a great room.

1617
01:08:39,883 --> 01:08:41,783
I could see myself
chilling here.

1618
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:44,619
Right. Throwing some football.

1619
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:46,754
Having a football match right
in the middle of the floor.

1620
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:49,757
Football, basketball,
you know, just all the sports.

1621
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,793
I'm so comfortable
and relaxed right now.

1622
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:53,161
Me, too.

1623
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:55,396
- Hey, Adam...
- Yeah.

1624
01:08:55,398 --> 01:08:56,598
...about what happened
at <i> Choozy Doozy...</i>

1625
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,701
No, it was...
You know, it was virtual.

1626
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:02,303
Yeah. Virtual.

1627
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:03,771
So it was just like...
(Blows raspberry)

1628
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:04,939
It's in the ether.

1629
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:07,075
- It does not exist.
- Who cares?

1630
01:09:07,077 --> 01:09:08,276
That shit happened.

1631
01:09:08,278 --> 01:09:09,811
Yeah, we should get
that show cancelled.

1632
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:11,479
Or at least arrest someone.

1633
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:13,948
I could've ate
some goddamn waffles.

1634
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:17,652
It's like you shoved
a fucking buick up my butt.

1635
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,854
I got a buick dick.

1636
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:21,523
You do.

1637
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:24,792
Shit got bad, Lou.

1638
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:27,295
I mean, bad like the part
of <i> boogie nights</i>

1639
01:09:27,297 --> 01:09:30,131
after Mark Wahlberg jerks off
in the pickup truck.

1640
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:32,500
I mean, here we are,
with the greatest power

1641
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:35,637
the universe has to offer
at our fingertips

1642
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:38,873
and we're just
a bunch of fuck-ups.

1643
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:43,511
(Sighs) Jacob, I know what
you're going through.

1644
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:44,646
Yeah, I know that you do.

1645
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:46,481
You're the biggest fuck-up
I know.

1646
01:09:46,483 --> 01:09:47,549
Look.

1647
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:50,652
(Sighs)

1648
01:09:50,654 --> 01:09:54,656
You know, all dorchen men
end up on a roof at
some point in their lives.

1649
01:09:54,658 --> 01:09:57,825
We party till we want to kill
ourselves. My dad did it.

1650
01:09:57,827 --> 01:09:59,661
And your son
will do it after you.

1651
01:09:59,663 --> 01:10:01,829
Even grandpappy dorchen?

1652
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:04,399
Jumped off a roof, survived,
died of syphilis.

1653
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:07,168
(Sighs)

1654
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:09,504
Jacob, how can we expect
to find happiness

1655
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:12,240
anywhere in time if we're just
not happy people?

1656
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:15,743
We do the best that we can.

1657
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:21,316
(Groans)

1658
01:10:21,318 --> 01:10:23,418
Here comes the hug monster.

1659
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:32,994
All right. Come on. Let's go
do some more dumb shit.

1660
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:34,062
(Laughs)

1661
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,066
- Whoa!
- I got you!

1662
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:39,867
- Lou, don't drop me!
- I got you!

1663
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:41,002
Don't drop me!

1664
01:10:41,004 --> 01:10:42,203
I'm not gonna let you fall,
I promise.

1665
01:10:42,205 --> 01:10:43,705
- I trust you.
- Okay.

1666
01:10:43,707 --> 01:10:44,739
Oh, fuck, I'm gonna drop you!

1667
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:45,873
Don't drop me! Don't drop me!

1668
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:47,542
I'm dropping you!
You fell!

1669
01:10:47,544 --> 01:10:48,843
Fuck you!

1670
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:51,045
No!

1671
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:53,915
Female automated voice:
<i>Suicide prevention activated.</i>

1672
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:56,084
Oh, look at that. Force field.

1673
01:10:56,086 --> 01:10:57,218
Oh, this is a great call.

1674
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,886
I must have invented that.

1675
01:10:58,888 --> 01:11:01,556
Seriously. Thank you, dad.

1676
01:11:01,558 --> 01:11:03,224
My pleasure, son.

1677
01:11:03,226 --> 01:11:05,426
- Is it fun?
- Yeah, it's kind of fun.

1678
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,829
You know what?
I'm coming down, too! Yay!

1679
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:10,265
(Snoring)

1680
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:12,567
Lou: Guys, guys, guys,
come on!

1681
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:14,569
We got a murder
to solve here, huh?

1682
01:11:14,571 --> 01:11:16,571
Let's think. It's not Winkle.

1683
01:11:16,573 --> 01:11:17,772
It's obviously not Jacob.

1684
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:18,906
- Right?
- Hey.

1685
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:20,742
- No? Right
- come on. Come on.

1686
01:11:20,744 --> 01:11:22,143
All right. Okay.

1687
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:23,911
(Device beeping)

1688
01:11:23,913 --> 01:11:26,581
<i>Some curious news out
of the tech sector today.</i>

1689
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:29,250
<i>A new synthetic element
has been developed.</i>

1690
01:11:29,252 --> 01:11:32,220
<i>The new element</i>
<i>invented by Brad Syed</i>
<i>of Lougle Labs,</i>

1691
01:11:32,222 --> 01:11:35,623

1692
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:36,691
That's it.

1693
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:39,961
- Brad never liked me.
- No?

1694
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:41,796
And Brad's going
to Adam's wedding.

1695
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:44,766
Oh, I keep forgetting
you guys know Brad.

1696
01:11:44,768 --> 01:11:48,002
It's gonna be fun, my wedding.
I'm looking forward to it.

1697
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,339
Oh, fuck! My wedding!

1698
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:03,484
Jill's going to kill me.
I have to go change.

1699
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:06,321
Oh, God. I can't believe that
son of a bitch stole my idea.

1700
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:09,457
Let's split up and find Brad
on three. One, two, three.

1701
01:12:09,459 --> 01:12:12,427
All: Split up and find Brad
before he goes back in time
and kills Lou!

1702
01:12:12,429 --> 01:12:14,462
- Wow! We are so locked in.
- Same page.

1703
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:15,797
- We are so locked in.
- Same page.

1704
01:12:15,799 --> 01:12:17,365
- That's awesome.
- Nick: Right.

1705
01:12:17,367 --> 01:12:20,668
It's normal for men
to blow off some steam
before their wedding, right?

1706
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:24,305
Adam? What'd he do, have
a light lunch and a spa day?

1707
01:12:24,307 --> 01:12:28,843
He did drugs and had sex
with a man he barely knows
on national TV.

1708
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,812
That doesn't sound like Adam.

1709
01:12:30,814 --> 01:12:34,148
(Sighs) Honey, like you said,
he's just blowing off steam.

1710
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:37,018
Why didn't I blow off steam?
I have steam to blow off.

1711
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,486
All I did
was get my hair done!

1712
01:12:38,488 --> 01:12:40,855
- It looks beautiful.
- Oh, shut up, you dumb slut.

1713
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:43,157
You blew half of Pittsburgh
before your
bachelorette party.

1714
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:44,392
Get me some champagne.

1715
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:54,168
I don't know
what's taking Jill.

1716
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:55,703
You think she saw
<i>Choozy Doozy?</i>

1717
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:57,038
Does she watch it?

1718
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,574
- It's her favorite show.
- Then she probably saw it.

1719
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:01,242
Fuck!

1720
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:02,577
Sorry.

1721
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:05,680
(Sighs)

1722
01:13:05,682 --> 01:13:08,883
This isn't good.
She's never late. Ever.

1723
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,852
Do you think
she and I are gonna be okay?

1724
01:13:10,854 --> 01:13:13,554
I don't know, man.
I'm not the guy to ask
about marriage.

1725
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:16,090
- Wait, are you married?
- Yeah. Well...

1726
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,626
I don't know.

1727
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:20,595
I hope so.

1728
01:13:20,597 --> 01:13:23,030
Okay.
Well, I have to find Jill.
Will you cover for me?

1729
01:13:23,032 --> 01:13:24,699
No, we gotta find Brad.

1730
01:13:24,701 --> 01:13:27,034
Fuck a dude. Fuck two dudes.

1731
01:13:27,036 --> 01:13:29,771
"I'm Adam.
I get plowed by dudes on TV."

1732
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:31,372
Oh.

1733
01:13:31,374 --> 01:13:33,775
Eeny, meeny, miney, drunk.

1734
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:35,376
(Scoffs)

1735
01:13:35,378 --> 01:13:36,811
Choozy Doozey.

1736
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:40,481
Oh, so sorry. Wrong room.

1737
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:43,451
(Giggles)

1738
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:47,121
Ohh, shit.

1739
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:52,560
<i>Anybody know a Brad Syed?
Report...</i>

1740
01:13:52,562 --> 01:13:55,096
Hey, Nick Webber.
Do the dance.

1741
01:13:55,098 --> 01:13:56,597
<i>You want me to do the dance?</i>

1742
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:57,899
Yeah, do the dance.

1743
01:13:57,901 --> 01:13:59,434
<i>You want me to do
the fucking dance?</i>

1744
01:13:59,436 --> 01:14:00,501
All: Yeah!

1745
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:07,642
<i>This is who I've become,
isn't it?</i>

1746
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:09,944
<i>The dancing clown.</i>

1747
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:12,246
<i>The man who will
apparently do anything</i>

1748
01:14:12,248 --> 01:14:14,949
<i>to keep
his shitty career going.</i>

1749
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:16,417
<i>Meanwhile,
when's the last time</i>

1750
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:18,586
<i>I shared a romantic dinner
with my wife?</i>

1751
01:14:18,588 --> 01:14:21,556
<i>Or just did anything,
just the two of us?</i>

1752
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:22,824
<i>It's been a minute.</i>

1753
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:26,594
<i>I'll bet there's a lot
of people here tonight</i>

1754
01:14:26,596 --> 01:14:28,463
<i>who have been
taken for granted.</i>

1755
01:14:28,465 --> 01:14:30,131
<i>This lady right here.</i>

1756
01:14:30,133 --> 01:14:31,766
<i>When's the last time
your man gave you flowers,</i>

1757
01:14:31,768 --> 01:14:33,201
<i>just because?</i>

1758
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:34,936
Fuck you, dude.

1759
01:14:34,938 --> 01:14:38,439
<i>Right?
On this special occasion,</i>

1760
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:41,108
<i>be thankful
for the one you're with.</i>

1761
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:43,344
<i>Make each moment count.</i>

1762
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:46,347
<i>Remember why you fell in love.</i>

1763
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:49,650
Now do the dance!

1764
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:50,818
All: Yeah!

1765
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,487
Do it! Do it!

1766
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:55,022
<i>Fuck it. D.J.!</i>

1767
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,358
(Music playing)

1768
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:04,365
(Speaking indistinctly)

1769
01:15:08,136 --> 01:15:09,604
(All gasp)

1770
01:15:09,606 --> 01:15:10,872
- (Gunshot)
- (All exclaim)

1771
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:13,975
- Hey, Brad.
- Hey, Jacob...

1772
01:15:13,977 --> 01:15:16,811
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1773
01:15:16,813 --> 01:15:18,446
Give me the Nitrotrinadium,
Brad!

1774
01:15:18,448 --> 01:15:19,981
Give me the fuckin' Nitro!

1775
01:15:19,983 --> 01:15:22,016
- Okay, okay.
- Slowly.

1776
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:23,184
Slowly.

1777
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:24,652
Be very careful,
it's my only one.

1778
01:15:24,654 --> 01:15:26,988
I only trust you with it.

1779
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:29,123
You thought you had it all
figured out, didn't ya?

1780
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:31,192
Just gonna go back in time
and kill my dad.

1781
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:32,827
- Kill your dad?
- Yeah.

1782
01:15:32,829 --> 01:15:34,328
I know your plan, Brad.

1783
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:35,830
Okay, sure,
I thought about it.

1784
01:15:35,832 --> 01:15:37,498
A lot. When I worked for him.

1785
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,733
I knew it.

1786
01:15:38,735 --> 01:15:40,668
But why would I wanna kill
the man partly responsible

1787
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:42,904
for the greatest scientific
achievement of all time?

1788
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,705
(Sighs)

1789
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:47,141
There was no such thing
as Nitrotrinadium

1790
01:15:47,143 --> 01:15:49,343
<i>when your dad gave me the idea
for it 10 years ago.</i>

1791
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:50,878
...for time travel!

1792
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,680
Brad: <i>He had a history
of pulling great ideas</i>

1793
01:15:52,682 --> 01:15:54,181
<i>- out of his ass...</i>
- Boom!

1794
01:15:54,183 --> 01:15:56,851
Brad: <i>...And goddamn it,
he did it again.</i>

1795
01:15:56,853 --> 01:15:59,220
I'm gonna be in the lab,
trying to save this company.

1796
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:03,357
I dedicated my life's work
to making Lou dorchen's vision
a reality.

1797
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:06,227
Wait. So you are the inventor
of time travel.

1798
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:08,696
Right? It's fucking awesome.

1799
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:10,031
So you weren't gonna
go back to 2015

1800
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:11,332
and shoot him in the dick.

1801
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:14,035
Shoot him? (Laughs)

1802
01:16:14,037 --> 01:16:17,071
If I was going
to kill your dad,
it wouldn't be with a gun.

1803
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:20,207
What I would do
is spike his morning cocktail

1804
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:21,242
with a potent sedative

1805
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:22,910
before dragging his body
to the Gulf and...

1806
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,545
Both: ...Feeding it
to a shark.

1807
01:16:24,547 --> 01:16:27,048
- Yeah.
- It's the perfect plan.

1808
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:29,550
Lou: Are you having
as fantastic a time as I am?

1809
01:16:29,552 --> 01:16:31,519
Jill: Shut up!
This isn't making love!

1810
01:16:31,521 --> 01:16:33,387
This is a "fuck you"
to my fiance!

1811
01:16:33,389 --> 01:16:34,922
Lou: Right, right,
right, right. Okay.

1812
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:37,725
Jill: Fuck me, Uncle Lou!
Lou: Whoa! Whoa! Hold on!

1813
01:16:37,727 --> 01:16:40,595
I feel like that is an
important distinction to make.

1814
01:16:40,597 --> 01:16:42,229
Fuck me,
Uncle Lou by marriage!

1815
01:16:42,231 --> 01:16:46,400
I can't believe I'm fucking
Adam's father's
future daughter-in-law!

1816
01:16:46,402 --> 01:16:47,935
Jill:
I can't believe I'm fucking

1817
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:50,171
Adam's father's
sister's husband!

1818
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:52,974
Adam! Have you seen Lou?

1819
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:55,076
(Whimpers)

1820
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:58,079
That jacuzzi time machine
thing, is that real?

1821
01:16:58,081 --> 01:16:59,780
- It's a hot tub.
- Whatever!

1822
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:01,716
Listen, Adam, I'm sorry,
I gotta be a stickler on this.

1823
01:17:01,718 --> 01:17:03,084
Jacuzzi is a brand name,
and...

1824
01:17:03,086 --> 01:17:04,986
Shut up! How does it work?

1825
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:08,155
- How does it work?
- This!

1826
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:12,326
Brad:
It's the only nitrotrinadium
in the whole world!

1827
01:17:12,328 --> 01:17:16,831
Ten fucking years!
It was a bitch to make, dude!

1828
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:19,567
I know, Brad. I didn't
mean to fuckin' lose it.

1829
01:17:19,569 --> 01:17:21,102
He got the jump on me.

1830
01:17:21,104 --> 01:17:23,504
But he's so much
smaller than you.

1831
01:17:23,506 --> 01:17:24,739
He had, like,
super-human strength,

1832
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:26,674
like that fucking baby
in <i> Superman I.</i>

1833
01:17:26,676 --> 01:17:29,610
You mean baby superman?
That baby was Superman.

1834
01:17:29,612 --> 01:17:30,678
(Stammers) Yeah, I mean...

1835
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,580
That baby was Superman, Jacob!

1836
01:17:35,517 --> 01:17:37,184
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

1837
01:17:37,186 --> 01:17:38,619
- Any luck?
- (Laughs)

1838
01:17:38,621 --> 01:17:40,521
- Yeah.
- You found him?

1839
01:17:40,523 --> 01:17:43,424
Oh, shit! No. Brad. No, you?

1840
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:45,259
Nah.

1841
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:47,094
Dude.

1842
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:49,697
Ten years of my life.

1843
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:51,032
Handle it.

1844
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:54,969
Instead of linear,
think of space-time
as being fluid...

1845
01:17:54,971 --> 01:17:56,504
- Hey.
- Hey, Lou.

1846
01:17:56,506 --> 01:17:57,672
(Grunts)

1847
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:59,473
(Chuckles)

1848
01:17:59,475 --> 01:18:00,875
Both: America!

1849
01:18:00,877 --> 01:18:02,943
Brad was helping.
He's not the murderer.

1850
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,813
Oh. Hmm.

1851
01:18:05,815 --> 01:18:07,448
- Oops.
- Then what happened?

1852
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:10,317
Adam took the nitro.
He's going back
to 2015 to kill you.

1853
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:13,154
Adam Junior's the murderer?
Why would he do that?

1854
01:18:13,156 --> 01:18:14,889
Um, hmm...

1855
01:18:14,891 --> 01:18:16,991
I think... uh...

1856
01:18:16,993 --> 01:18:19,727
You guys are gonna think
this is hilarious. I may have,

1857
01:18:20,562 --> 01:18:25,166
uh, fucked his wife.
A tiny bit! A tiny bit.

1858
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:27,068
You know, in her vagina,
or whatever.

1859
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:28,335
Fuck, Lou!

1860
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:29,904
So you just created
your own killer.

1861
01:18:29,906 --> 01:18:31,972
- Oh, so I'm the bad guy now!
- Yes!

1862
01:18:31,974 --> 01:18:33,040
Yes.

1863
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:34,742
Come on!

1864
01:18:34,744 --> 01:18:36,077
Jacob: Fuck!

1865
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:37,678
Lou: Shit.

1866
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,580
Baby Adam got away.

1867
01:18:39,582 --> 01:18:41,982
Oh, shit. Shit.
Look, look, look!

1868
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:44,018
Come on, come on, come on...

1869
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:46,921
No, no, no, no, no!
This has got to end now.

1870
01:18:46,923 --> 01:18:48,689
- (Sighs)
- Nick and Jacob: Lou...

1871
01:18:48,691 --> 01:18:50,391
- Lou, what are you doing?
- Lou, get out of the road.

1872
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:51,926
- Nick and Jacob: Lou!
- I know what I'm doing!

1873
01:18:51,928 --> 01:18:53,227
Get the fuck out
of the street!

1874
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:55,396
You don't know
what you're doing.
You're going to die!

1875
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:56,530
Lou, would you come
the fuck on?

1876
01:18:56,532 --> 01:18:57,998
Let me do this! I got this!

1877
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,266
I got this!

1878
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:00,468
- Stop!
- (Nick and Jacob gasp)

1879
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:07,775
I'm sorry. Okay.

1880
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:11,445
- (Engine revs)
- Okay, okay, okay! I mean it.

1881
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:13,748
I do. I mean it. I'm a dick.
Ask my friends.

1882
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,216
- He's a dick.
- Big ol' dick.

1883
01:19:15,218 --> 01:19:17,284
Look, I get you. I do.

1884
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:19,920
I know what it's like
to feel unappreciated,

1885
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:22,456
like just a member
of the pack.

1886
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:25,960
I just want you to know that
despite what I said before,

1887
01:19:25,962 --> 01:19:27,628
I do appreciate you.

1888
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:30,464
And I'm appealing to your
sense of humanity right now.

1889
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:33,234
There is a maniac
trying to kill me.

1890
01:19:33,236 --> 01:19:36,871
And I'm asking you
to be the bigger car
and help me out.

1891
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:41,142
I'm just a guy

1892
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:43,210
looking at a car

1893
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:46,213
and asking it to love me.

1894
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:49,984
(Car beeps)

1895
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:53,020
(Lou sighs)

1896
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:55,956
(Brakes screech)

1897
01:20:00,762 --> 01:20:01,996
(Honks)

1898
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:07,201
Listen, you can't
go with me, okay?

1899
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:08,936
Scat!

1900
01:20:08,938 --> 01:20:10,571
- (Car beeps)
- (Sighs)

1901
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:16,577
Hey, listen. I'll be back,
okay? I promise I'll be back.

1902
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:19,079
We'll go all the places that
we never got to go.

1903
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:20,915
Okay? Just...

1904
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:23,918
Wait for me. You, uh...

1905
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:26,353
Stay blue.

1906
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:29,690
(Car beeps sadly)

1907
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:37,164
Jacob: Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1908
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:41,502
We're too late.
We just missed him.

1909
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:44,505
I guess that's it.
We're stuck here.

1910
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:46,707
That means in a minute,
Lou's going to

1911
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:48,909
disappear.

1912
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:52,847
No. That can't be right.
Right, Jacob?

1913
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:55,516
I mean, you got...
You got a plan or something.

1914
01:20:55,518 --> 01:20:57,618
No. We just got to, um...

1915
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,520
What are we gonna do?

1916
01:20:59,522 --> 01:21:01,021
Fuck, I don't know.

1917
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:02,790
I don't know.

1918
01:21:04,559 --> 01:21:05,960
Aw, shit, Lou.

1919
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:23,944
- I'll miss you, brother.
- I'll miss you, too.

1920
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:31,552
(Softly) Hey.

1921
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:34,622
Before I forget, will you just
keep an eye on him?

1922
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:39,059
He's got such
a big future ahead of him.

1923
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:40,594
- Obviously.
- Yeah.

1924
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:46,066
(Scoffs)

1925
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:47,835
(Chuckles)
I got it.

1926
01:21:47,837 --> 01:21:49,236
Jacob, it's okay. Don't...

1927
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:50,404
No, no, no.

1928
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:53,841
Our nitro was missing
because it didn't exist yet.

1929
01:21:53,843 --> 01:21:56,710
But if Adam took
the nitro to the past,

1930
01:21:56,712 --> 01:21:58,479
then it exists here
in the future.

1931
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,150
Holy shit!

1932
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:05,419
Nick: There's still time.

1933
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:07,087
- Jacob! (Grunts)
- Let's go!

1934
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,225
Nick: We gotta go back to
the past to save the future.

1935
01:22:11,227 --> 01:22:12,426
What does this remind you of?

1936
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,929
- Always <i> Terminator.</i>
- Always <i> Terminator.</i> I know.

1937
01:22:14,931 --> 01:22:16,263
Let's go save Lou's life.

1938
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:17,765
Both: High five.

1939
01:22:17,767 --> 01:22:19,133
High five.

1940
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:20,634
(Electricity crackling)

1941
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,108
This is my favorite part!

1942
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:29,543
Ah, here we go! Here we go!

1943
01:22:29,545 --> 01:22:31,278
(All screaming)

1944
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:46,393
- I think we made it!
- Let's go!

1945
01:22:46,395 --> 01:22:47,461
- Let's go!
- Okay.

1946
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:50,064
(Music playing)

1947
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:55,069
It's the party.
And there's still time!

1948
01:22:55,071 --> 01:22:57,304
He's gotta be around
here somewhere!

1949
01:22:57,906 --> 01:23:00,307
Buffer: <i> We are live!</i>

1950
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:03,644
<i>From lougle mansion.</i>

1951
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:08,382
<i>Worth 2.3 billion dollars,
introducing</i>

1952
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:11,385
<i>Lou "The Violator"</i>

1953
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:14,855
<i>Dorchen!</i>

1954
01:23:14,857 --> 01:23:16,557
(Guests cheering)

1955
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:20,561
(Squealing)

1956
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:26,867
- Hey, everybody.
- Adam: Lou!

1957
01:23:26,869 --> 01:23:28,402
(All screaming)

1958
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:31,939
Lou, I found him.

1959
01:23:31,941 --> 01:23:33,440
I'm going to shoot you
in the dick

1960
01:23:33,442 --> 01:23:35,776
so you can't fuck
anyone else's wife!

1961
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:37,111
Technically,
you all aren't married yet,

1962
01:23:37,113 --> 01:23:38,812
- so she's not your wife.
- Yes, she is!

1963
01:23:38,814 --> 01:23:41,115
Jacob:
Adam, I hate to be a stickler,
but you guys haven't met yet.

1964
01:23:41,117 --> 01:23:42,182
- It's 2015.
- Shut the fuck up!

1965
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:43,484
- Mazel Tov!
- Congratulations!

1966
01:23:43,486 --> 01:23:44,618
(Woman screams)

1967
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:50,190
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1968
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:52,259
It's probably pretty hard
to shoot a man, right?

1969
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:53,861
Don't.

1970
01:23:53,863 --> 01:23:56,096
It's okay. It's okay. Watch.

1971
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:59,867
I'm just gonna make it
easier on you. Look.

1972
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:02,903
(Sighs)

1973
01:24:02,905 --> 01:24:05,739
- Shotgun to the dick.
- His destiny.

1974
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:08,409
I turned you into a murderer.

1975
01:24:08,411 --> 01:24:09,877
I've just ruined my own life.

1976
01:24:09,879 --> 01:24:12,579
I have so much
fuckin' poison in me
that I've ruined yours, too.

1977
01:24:12,581 --> 01:24:14,248
Jacob was right.

1978
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:15,816
I'm a virus.

1979
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:19,653
This is your revenge to take.
Okay?

1980
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:21,922
Please.

1981
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,927
I've seen my future.

1982
01:24:26,929 --> 01:24:28,662
You saw it. I'm a disaster.

1983
01:24:29,597 --> 01:24:30,931
It's okay.

1984
01:24:30,933 --> 01:24:33,500
Just kill me and put us both
out of our misery?

1985
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:35,436
Please.

1986
01:24:35,438 --> 01:24:37,104
I can't.

1987
01:24:37,106 --> 01:24:38,372
I can't do it.

1988
01:24:38,374 --> 01:24:41,542
Jesus Christ, do I have
to fucking do everything?

1989
01:24:41,544 --> 01:24:42,609
Lou...

1990
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:44,378
No!

1991
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:45,846
(All exclaim)

1992
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:50,350
You okay?

1993
01:24:52,954 --> 01:24:54,788
You're fucking crazy, Lou.

1994
01:24:59,194 --> 01:25:00,828
(Breathing heavily)

1995
01:25:02,897 --> 01:25:04,598
I'm sorry,
I may have shit my pants.

1996
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,633
That's all right.
It was a stressful situation.

1997
01:25:06,635 --> 01:25:08,602
It was really stressful.
I'm exhausted.

1998
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:09,803
Both: Oh!

1999
01:25:09,805 --> 01:25:11,805
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry.

2000
01:25:11,807 --> 01:25:14,475
- Jill?
- How did you know my...

2001
01:25:14,477 --> 01:25:16,577
Oh. My Nametag.

2002
01:25:16,579 --> 01:25:18,312
No, no,
it's because you're my...

2003
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:23,317
I'm sorry. This is just...
This is weird.

2004
01:25:23,319 --> 01:25:26,920
Up until yesterday,
I thought I had a normal life.

2005
01:25:26,922 --> 01:25:28,889
I know what you mean. I...

2006
01:25:28,891 --> 01:25:31,825
Have you ever felt like
your entire life was a fraud?

2007
01:25:31,827 --> 01:25:33,827
I'm sorry. "Fraud" is
the wrong word. "Lie"?

2008
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:38,599
I'm Adam.

2009
01:25:38,601 --> 01:25:41,401
- I'm...
- Jill. I know.

2010
01:25:41,403 --> 01:25:43,170
Lovely tuxedo you're wearing.

2011
01:25:43,172 --> 01:25:45,405
Thank you.
Well, it's for our...

2012
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:48,876
(Speaking gibberish)

2013
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:52,579
Forgot what I was
going to say.

2014
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:02,289
Well, that was exciting.

2015
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:03,491
I guess it's not
a lougle party

2016
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:04,791
until somebody gets shot at.

2017
01:26:04,793 --> 01:26:05,959
I don't want to go
to the Grammys.

2018
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:07,094
No?

2019
01:26:07,096 --> 01:26:08,696
I don't wanna go
to your sister's either.

2020
01:26:08,697 --> 01:26:10,457
I just want to go somewhere,
just you and me.

2021
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:13,167
Start making things right.

2022
01:26:14,435 --> 01:26:16,770
I like that. Okay.

2023
01:26:16,772 --> 01:26:18,438
And I want to get out
of this shirt.

2024
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,806
I've been in it for, like,
three days,

2025
01:26:19,808 --> 01:26:20,908
and it's really loud.

2026
01:26:21,976 --> 01:26:23,777
- Come here.
- Hmm?

2027
01:26:23,779 --> 01:26:26,013
Put your arms up for a sec,
like that.

2028
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:29,850
Is this a dance or something?

2029
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:32,286
Something like that.
More of a Strut.

2030
01:26:32,288 --> 01:26:33,687
I'm coming in.

2031
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:35,622
Okay. (Giggles)

2032
01:26:35,624 --> 01:26:38,625
- There it is. Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

2033
01:26:38,627 --> 01:26:42,196
- Oh, this is some stupid shit.
- You have no idea.

2034
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:45,165
Kelly:
Did I just hear fireworks?

2035
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:47,601
Because fireworks make me want
to puke, and you know that.

2036
01:26:57,078 --> 01:26:58,312
Hmm? Mmm...

2037
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:02,616
Why are you more handsome?

2038
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:05,419
I'm a bald person.

2039
01:27:05,421 --> 01:27:06,653
Hey.

2040
01:27:06,655 --> 01:27:09,122
What do you think about doing
a 12-step program with me?

2041
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:12,759
You know, like,
go to an awesome rehab

2042
01:27:12,761 --> 01:27:15,062
with good food and a pool

2043
01:27:15,064 --> 01:27:16,563
and classy people.

2044
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:19,900
What do you think?

2045
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:22,569
- Okay.
- Yeah?

2046
01:27:23,171 --> 01:27:24,905
I fucking hate you, Lou.

2047
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:26,406
I fucking hate you, Kelly.

2048
01:27:30,345 --> 01:27:32,579
Jacob: Sophie! Hey!
Where are you going?

2049
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:34,248
Um, people are shooting
each other.

2050
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:35,716
I'm getting out of here.

2051
01:27:35,718 --> 01:27:39,019
I've seen our future together
and I will be the first person

2052
01:27:39,021 --> 01:27:41,688
to admit that it is
fucking insane.
The drugs,

2053
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:42,889
the constant partying.

2054
01:27:42,891 --> 01:27:45,292
It's enough to make
anybody ask,
"when is enough enough?"

2055
01:27:45,294 --> 01:27:46,426
What are you talking about?

2056
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:47,694
Just stay with me here.
Just stay with me.

2057
01:27:47,696 --> 01:27:49,263
Did you change?

2058
01:27:49,265 --> 01:27:51,198
Yeah, in so many ways.
But, listen,

2059
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,532
right in the middle
of that future

2060
01:27:52,534 --> 01:27:55,435
is this toxic power couple
named you and me.

2061
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:57,471
And does it all end
in tragedy and tears

2062
01:27:57,473 --> 01:27:59,640
and a murder mystery?
Yes, of course it does.

2063
01:27:59,642 --> 01:28:01,208
But I don't care.

2064
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:04,111
I just got one question,
Sophie.

2065
01:28:04,113 --> 01:28:05,993
Are you ready for the ride
of your fucking life?

2066
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:21,461
What's that in your pocket?

2067
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:23,297
My dick.

2068
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:25,966
Oh, the other thing.

2069
01:28:26,734 --> 01:28:29,303
A billion fucking dollars.

2070
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:34,308
Hey, I just met
my future wife in there.

2071
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:37,244
Yeah, man. Hang out with us,
that kind of shit happens
all the time.

2072
01:28:37,246 --> 01:28:39,346
Yeah.
A lot of highs and lows here.

2073
01:28:39,348 --> 01:28:40,981
- Yeah.
- When you think about it,

2074
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:43,250
Lou had to fuck your wife
in the future,

2075
01:28:43,252 --> 01:28:45,152
so you could meet her
in the past.

2076
01:28:45,154 --> 01:28:47,821
- Well...
- Yeah. But, hey...

2077
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:49,156
That's what uncles do, right?

2078
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:52,326
Not really.

2079
01:28:52,328 --> 01:28:53,694
Jacob: Hey,
just think of it this way.

2080
01:28:53,696 --> 01:28:55,495
Since it happened
in the future,

2081
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:57,431
it technically hasn't
happened at all.

2082
01:28:57,433 --> 01:28:59,333
It's Cyclical.

2083
01:28:59,335 --> 01:29:03,170
Adam: Yeah. And even though
I didn't meet my dad,
I met some friends for life.

2084
01:29:03,172 --> 01:29:04,438
Nick: Oh, yeah? Who?

2085
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,840
- Adam: Hey, Lou?
- Uncle Lou.

2086
01:29:07,775 --> 01:29:09,776
Uncle Lou.

2087
01:29:09,778 --> 01:29:12,679
No harm, no foul,
but did you ejaculate in her?

2088
01:29:12,681 --> 01:29:15,115
Hey. That doesn't matter.

2089
01:29:15,117 --> 01:29:17,351
I ejaculated inside of you.

2090
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:18,719
Jacob: And that doesn't
matter either.

2091
01:29:18,721 --> 01:29:21,688
Because those are both just
hypothetical future scenarios.

2092
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:23,890
No one ejaculated inside
of anything, really.

2093
01:29:23,892 --> 01:29:25,292
No one's ejaculated.

2094
01:29:25,294 --> 01:29:27,627
- (Whispers) Yeah, I did.
- Lou: You know what?

2095
01:29:27,629 --> 01:29:29,262
I had this moment earlier.

2096
01:29:31,132 --> 01:29:33,567
I think it was when my nephew
from the future

2097
01:29:33,569 --> 01:29:35,202
had a shotgun
pointed at my dick

2098
01:29:35,204 --> 01:29:36,444
that I'd helped him
place there.

2099
01:29:37,472 --> 01:29:39,139
That was me.

2100
01:29:39,141 --> 01:29:43,310
But in that moment,
everything became clear to me.

2101
01:29:43,312 --> 01:29:45,379
We need to change
people's lives.

2102
01:29:45,381 --> 01:29:47,280
Make the world a better place.

2103
01:29:47,915 --> 01:29:50,317
All we have to do is...

2104
01:29:50,319 --> 01:29:51,385
(Gunshot)

2105
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:53,587
- (Retches)
- Ah!

2106
01:29:53,589 --> 01:29:55,021
(All screaming)

2107
01:29:55,023 --> 01:29:56,923
Lou!

2108
01:29:56,925 --> 01:29:58,992
Man: Don't listen to
anything he says.

2109
01:29:58,994 --> 01:30:01,795
Jacob: Adam?
Nick: What the fuck?
You shot Lou!

2110
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:03,230
Dad?

2111
01:30:04,098 --> 01:30:05,532
What's going on?

2112
01:30:05,534 --> 01:30:08,268
-No time to explain.
Follow me.
-But where?

2113
01:30:09,771 --> 01:30:10,937
Cincinnati.

2114
01:30:10,939 --> 01:30:12,239
Adam: No, no, dad, wait!

2115
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:15,442
Why did my dad just kill Lou?

2116
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:21,047
-He probably had
an okay reason.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2117
01:30:21,049 --> 01:30:22,983
Wait! Don't go with Adam!

2118
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:24,918
(Screams)

2119
01:30:25,887 --> 01:30:27,053
(Sighs)

2120
01:30:27,055 --> 01:30:28,221
Patriot Lou.

2121
01:30:28,223 --> 01:30:29,890
Are those wooden teeth?

2122
01:30:29,892 --> 01:30:32,526
Nick: He looks
like Cap'n Crunch
fucked Paul Revere.

2123
01:30:32,528 --> 01:30:35,262
- His hair is breathtaking.
- He's beautiful.

2124
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:38,432
- Don't listen to him.
- Why?

2125
01:30:38,434 --> 01:30:40,233
It's a long story.

2126
01:30:40,235 --> 01:30:43,537
Believe me,
he did us all a favor.
This one was bad.

2127
01:30:43,539 --> 01:30:45,238
(Stammers) Okay.
But the bigger question is,
how...

2128
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:46,306
That's not the only me.

2129
01:30:46,308 --> 01:30:47,574
You think you're the only you?

2130
01:30:47,576 --> 01:30:49,443
There's a ton of yous
out there.

2131
01:30:49,445 --> 01:30:51,645
Look, you're gonna like
this me a lot better.

2132
01:30:51,647 --> 01:30:53,380
This me is great.
Take it from me.

2133
01:30:53,382 --> 01:30:54,614
Holy shit.

2134
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:57,984
I mean,
you guys get it, right?

2135
01:30:57,986 --> 01:31:00,487
Multiple universes,
like <i> fringe.</i>

2136
01:31:03,257 --> 01:31:07,093
<i>- ♪ Nerd
- ♪ You're a fucking nerd</i>

2137
01:31:07,095 --> 01:31:08,428
<i>♪ Poindexter</i>

2138
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:10,831
<i>♪ You're a fucking nerd</i>

01:31:10,833 --> 01:31:12,065
<i>♪ And no one likes you</i>

2140
01:31:12,067 --> 01:31:13,600
Adam: <i>♪ You're a nerd.

2141
01:31:13,602 --> 01:31:16,403
<i>- ♪ And no one likes you

2142
01:31:16,405 --> 01:31:17,971

01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:19,072
<i>♪ Let's... ♪</i>

2144
01:31:19,074 --> 01:31:20,173
I'm sorry.

2145
01:31:20,175 --> 01:31:22,843
Obviously not the direction
of the song, right?

2146
01:31:22,845 --> 01:31:25,946
I totally misread that song.
My apologies.

2147
01:31:25,948 --> 01:31:27,614
Okay, so what now?

2148
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,982
Yeah. You guys
gotta come with me.

2149
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:30,050
To where?

2150
01:31:31,919 --> 01:31:34,321
We gotta make
America happen, bro.

2151
01:31:37,091 --> 01:31:38,592
Ready for another dip?

2152
01:31:38,594 --> 01:31:40,026
You know, you're not gonna
be super welcome there,

2153
01:31:40,028 --> 01:31:41,595
- but we should totally go.
- I know.

2154
01:31:41,597 --> 01:31:42,896
- Are we going?
- Yeah.

2155
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:45,031
(All screaming)

2156
01:31:57,645 --> 01:31:58,912
(All cheering)

2157
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:01,147
Adam saved Lincoln!

2158
01:32:01,149 --> 01:32:04,317
That parade was the single
greatest moment of my life.

2159
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:05,819
More so than saving Lincoln?

2160
01:32:05,821 --> 01:32:07,187
No, that was the third
greatest moment of my life.

2161
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:08,321
What was the second?

2162
01:32:08,323 --> 01:32:09,923
A parade I attended
as a child.

2163
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:17,831
Oh, shit, you guys. I left
my phone back in the 1800s.

2164
01:32:17,833 --> 01:32:19,499
I fed some gum to a dinosaur.

2165
01:32:19,501 --> 01:32:21,501
As long as we're coming clean,
I fucked Marilyn Monroe.

2166
01:32:21,503 --> 01:32:22,702
(Scoffing)

2167
01:32:22,704 --> 01:32:24,604
Yeah. Sure you did, buddy.

2168
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,677
Who's a nerd now,
motherfuckers, huh?

2169
01:32:30,679 --> 01:32:31,945
I'm Arthur Miller.

2170
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:34,447
Oh, come... come on!

2171
01:32:40,688 --> 01:32:42,055
You look like...

2172
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:43,557
- Come on, baby. You got this.
- Let him do it.

2173
01:32:43,559 --> 01:32:45,225
- Let him do it.
- We'll let him do it.

2174
01:32:45,227 --> 01:32:46,893
Come on. Something fucked
something to make it happen.

2175
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:50,196
It's easy. You just mash
two things up together
and then you nail him with it.

2176
01:32:50,198 --> 01:32:53,033
You look like...
Kevin Yardley!

2177
01:32:53,035 --> 01:32:54,601
Who the fuck is Kevin Yardley?

2178
01:32:54,603 --> 01:32:55,869
A guy I went
to high school with.

2179
01:32:55,871 --> 01:32:56,903
Yeah, he looks just like him.

2180
01:32:56,905 --> 01:32:59,639
Boo! You suck at this!

2181
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:07,047
I just get sick
of explaining it to him.

2182
01:33:07,049 --> 01:33:08,882
How hard is it
to understand time travel?

2183
01:33:08,884 --> 01:33:11,551
I mean, we get it.
E equals mc-squared.

2184
01:33:11,553 --> 01:33:12,953
Einstein's a stupid
fucking idiot.

2185
01:33:12,955 --> 01:33:14,054
- Right?
- Yeah.

2186
01:33:14,056 --> 01:33:15,622
(Crowd cheering)

2187
01:33:17,558 --> 01:33:20,327
Ed Sullivan: <i>Ladies
and gentlemen, the Beatles!</i>

2188
01:33:21,963 --> 01:33:23,430
(All laughing)

2189
01:33:23,432 --> 01:33:25,231
You're fucking Ringo!

2190
01:33:25,233 --> 01:33:26,299
Damn it.

2191
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:33,106
Man: <i>Apple is going
to reinvent the phone.</i>

2192
01:33:36,577 --> 01:33:39,980
- Explain yourself.
- I will not.

2193
01:33:39,982 --> 01:33:41,982
- I'm Nick Webber.
- I'm Jacob Dorchen.

2194
01:33:41,984 --> 01:33:43,717
I'm Adam Yates Stedmeyer.

2195
01:33:43,719 --> 01:33:49,189
All that and one less minute
tonight on <i> 59 minutes.</i>

2196
01:33:50,558 --> 01:33:52,025
(Men speaking indistinctly
on radio)

2197
01:33:55,062 --> 01:33:57,464
- Yes!
- Both: The moon!

2198
01:33:57,466 --> 01:33:59,733
First man to save a president
and go into space.

2199
01:33:59,735 --> 01:34:03,203
It was just a soundstage
in new Mexico.
It wasn't real.

2200
