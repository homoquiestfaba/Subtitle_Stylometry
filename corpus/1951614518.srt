1
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:45,282
Oh, that's it! Spindle, taillight.

2
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,500
Hey. Hey!

3
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:00,158
-What?
-What do you mean, "what"?

4
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:02,634
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

5
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:06,503
Yeah, this is the sleeping chamber.
Go to sleep.

6
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:08,473
Don't make me come up there!

7
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:13,378
I'm so sorry, but I must have
the final ingredient for my potion.

8
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,245
Now, what's more important:

9
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:21,357
Me completing my life's work
for the salvation of the colony--

10
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:23,321
Which includes you guys.

11
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:25,620
--or your sleep?

12
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:28,389
-Sleep. I'm going with sleep.
-Yeah, the second one.

13
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,762
Well, then I shall try to be very quiet.

14
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:33,698
Clacktiel.

15
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:39,733
That's it, I'm coming up there!

16
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:43,005
Fire crystals.

17
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,372
At last. The final ingredient.

18
00:02:51,788 --> 00:02:54,052
I'm on vacation.

19
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:59,621
-No. No, cut it out.
-Dogpile.

20
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:01,696
Dogpile.

21
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,501
It's the Destroyer!

22
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:15,106
Atomic wedgy.

23
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,478
And a clean break.

24
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:19,877
-Clean break. Excellent wedge.
-Yeah. All right.

25
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:22,677
Come on, man,
I'm running out of underwear.

26
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:25,184
Well, what are you gonna do about it, huh?
Nothing.

27
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:30,190
-Because I'm big and you're small.
-Yeah.

28
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,457
-Because he's big and you're small.
-Hey.

29
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,328
Quit repeating everything I say.

30
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:40,526
I was just adding emphasis, dude.

31
00:03:40,703 --> 00:03:43,467
Man, why you gotta be hating?

32
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:01,649
Destroyer.

33
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:16,998
Zoc?

34
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,668
Water!

35
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,901
-Zoc.
-Hova, please, get to the grass.

36
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:23,477
It's dangerous up here.

37
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:26,137
But I've always wanted to see
a human up close.

38
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:28,648
I hear they're capable of speech, like us.

39
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:31,480
They are nothing like us.

40
00:04:37,327 --> 00:04:40,228
What you gonna do about it, ants?
Nothing.

41
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:43,957
Because I'm big and you're small.

42
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:49,070
Away, monster, or I will use my powers
to destroy you.

43
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:55,866
Powers that I have yet to perfect. Run!

44
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,382
Hello.

45
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,922
We mean you no harm.

46
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:10,423
-Oh, great.
-Shoe!

47
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:12,322
Shoe!

48
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:21,967
-Please, go in peace.
-Look out!

49
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:30,574
-Are you all right?
-l-- I guess he didn't hear me.

50
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:33,512
Lucas.

51
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:35,981
Peanut, it's time to come inside now.

52
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:45,017
Peanut.

53
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:48,196
I think I might have gotten through
to him.

54
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:52,095
-What do you think?
-Destroyer.

55
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:56,571
Tiffany, Lucas, we're leaving now.

56
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:59,468
Lucas? All the numbers are on the fridge.

57
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:03,203
-<i>Good one. Extended play.</i>
-Lucas.

58
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:07,710
What are you doing back there?
Why didn't you answer?

59
00:06:08,217 --> 00:06:10,310
-Are you all right, sweetie?
-I'm fine.

60
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:13,887
-I was just playing with my friends.
-I don't know.

61
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:17,686
-Maybe we shouldn't go on vacation.
-Come on, it's our big wedding anniversary.

62
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,623
We're going to Puerco Vallarta.

63
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:24,529
And I gotta spend a little quality time
with the <i>mamacita.</i>

64
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:27,702
Don't cancel your vacation
just because of me.

65
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,863
-I can solve my own problems.
-Problems? What problems?

66
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,033
Does it have anything to do with
why I can't find your underwear?

67
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:36,439
No!

68
00:06:36,612 --> 00:06:39,581
Bed-wetting is nothing
to be ashamed of, Peanut.

69
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:41,649
What? Just stop it, Mom!

70
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,878
I don't have any problems
except for you treating me like a baby.

71
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,480
-Peanut.
-And stop calling me that.

72
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,286
Just go away and leave me alone.

73
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:58,628
I, Zoc, call upon the elements:

74
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:03,602
The wind that blows, rain that falls,
fire that burns.

75
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:07,971
Deliver your awesome power
and transform my potion.

76
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:09,873
Clacktiel.

77
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,475
That was great, sweetie.

78
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:19,143
I loved the smoke effects.
Didn't you, Spindle?

79
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:21,053
You...

80
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:23,089
...rock. Curse upon your children.

81
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:25,887
I don't think rocks have children, honey.

82
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,396
-They won't now.
-Okay. What's the matter?

83
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:32,864
Hova, the potion is supposed to
change color.

84
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,493
It's not changing color.
It's not changing color.

85
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:38,970
I call upon the elements:
Wind, rain, et cetera.

86
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:41,667
Transform my potion and clacktiel.

87
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,980
Clacktiel, clacktiel....

88
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:51,279
-Maybe you're pronouncing it wrong.
-How could I pronounce it wrong?

89
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:54,651
-I made it up.
-Take a break.

90
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:56,451
Hova, perhaps you didn't notice...

91
00:07:56,626 --> 00:08:00,619
...but we were almost squished today,
and the colony is in shambles.

92
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:04,892
I am this close to finding a solution
to the human problem...

93
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,627
...and you tell me I need to--
Hova, what are you doing?

94
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:09,794
-Nothing, I'm not doing anything.
-No. Wait.

95
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:11,837
-No.
-I'm simply walking towards you.

96
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:14,238
-There's no reason to panic.
-Wait. Now, Hova--

97
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,878
-I'm just coming towards you.
-Wait. No. Hova. No.

98
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:19,310
Does it tickle?
What about when I do this?

99
00:08:19,482 --> 00:08:21,416
Why are you laughing?
I see you laughing.

100
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,643
Don't make me clacktiel you.

101
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,017
Well, I'm glad you two have something
to laugh about.

102
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,653
-Head of Council.
-Hi.

103
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:35,194
How nice of you to....
It was unexpected.

104
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:37,992
Forgive me.
I was working on an experiment.

105
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:40,362
Oh, yes, I see.

106
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:44,097
Well, we were-- How may I be of service?

107
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,504
Zoc, attacks from the Destroyer
grow more frequent.

108
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:50,441
Our food supplies
are now desperately low.

109
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:55,277
The council was hoping
perhaps you might have a solution.

110
00:08:56,252 --> 00:08:58,914
Fight back. We must stop the Destroyer.

111
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:01,386
But thousands of ants
would needlessly die.

112
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:05,288
Perhaps if we could communicate,
you know, just talk with the human.

113
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:09,022
Oh, what a great idea.
Let's have a nice chat.

114
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:12,497
Well, hello, Destroyer.
Gee, you look kind of tired.

115
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:15,159
Why don't you just rest your feet
on my girlfriend.

116
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:16,566
Okay, oka--

117
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:19,207
Sometimes you're a real stinkbug,
you know that?

118
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:24,540
Zoc, a war with the human is--
It's impossible.

119
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:29,174
A wizard knows no such word.

120
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:36,957
-Whatever.
-Bye, Tiff. Bye, Lucas.

121
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:39,526
I love you.

122
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:43,491
You kids mind your grandma.

123
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,930
Okay, goodbye. Have fun.

124
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:49,299
Don't worry, everything's under control.

125
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:56,534
A little help, please.

126
00:09:56,712 --> 00:09:59,306
I think it's your turn.

127
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,450
Teeth in the grass.

128
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:06,845
Mommo, here's your--
What are you doing?

129
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:11,119
Preventing alien abduction,
that's what I'm doing.

130
00:10:11,294 --> 00:10:13,285
Thank you.

131
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:17,195
Dang crabgrass.

132
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:21,803
See these? Airflow. Aliens hate airflow.

133
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:27,168
Drives them nuts. And if they try to cut
the power in the middle of the night...

134
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:31,872
...these babies will wake me up.

135
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:36,212
-We gotta be prepared. Tell your friends.
-I don't have any friends.

136
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,853
Well, who's gonna look out for you
when you get old...

137
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:43,014
...and your teeth are falling out,
and them aliens are after you?

138
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:46,821
-Lucas.
-I'll look after myself.

139
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:51,391
-Good night, Mommo.
-Good night. Sleep tight.

140
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,592
Don't let the bedbugs bite...

141
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:56,966
...or creep into your ear
and lay eggs in your brain.

142
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:15,315
-Dance, Pukas.
-Dance, monkey boy, dance!

143
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,654
Think fast.

144
00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:41,277
Clacktiel.

145
00:11:44,553 --> 00:11:46,316
You....

146
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:49,151
Zoc, please, not in front of Spindle.

147
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,117
Sorry.

148
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:56,859
God, there must be something I missed.

149
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,191
Wait. A crack.

150
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:02,462
That's it. Imperfections in the crystals.

151
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,539
Perhaps coating it
in a viscous compound.

152
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,676
Spindle. Resin.

153
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:17,413
Clacktiel.

154
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:27,424
Oh, that's it. It worked!
The potion is complete!

155
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:32,696
Praise the Mother! Yes! Yes! Yes!

156
00:12:32,868 --> 00:12:34,301
No!

157
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:39,230
-Zoc.
-Hova, hang on.

158
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:43,202
Spindle, get the potion. Quickly.

159
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:15,335
Hello.

160
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:22,116
Yep, I was about your age
when I flooded my first colony.

161
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:26,888
Brother, those were good times.
Good times!

162
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,288
-Who are you?
-Stan Beals is the name.

163
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,155
Beals-A-Bug Pest Control.

164
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,426
Exterminator, eradicator,
solver of problems.

165
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,296
Hey, you must be the Nickle boy, right?

166
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:42,494
Now, your dad ordered my services...

167
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:45,299
...but he forgot to sign the contract
before he left.

168
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:48,443
Busy man. Lot on his mind. It happens.

169
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:51,671
So he just told me to talk to you....

170
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,815
-Lucas.
-Yeah, Lucas.

171
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:58,750
He said, "You have my son, Lucas,
sign the contract for me...

172
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,948
...if I happen to forget to before I leave.
He's a grown man now."

173
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,116
His exact words.

174
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,163
I don't know.
Do you have any references?

175
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:11,766
References?

176
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,697
There's one.

177
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:17,869
I don't think I should.

178
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:23,072
You don't think you should, huh?
You don't think?

179
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:26,772
So who does your thinking for you?
Your mommy?

180
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,417
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,
what do I do?

181
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:32,452
I'm just a little baby
that can't think for myself.

182
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,384
Please wipe my little bottom for me.

183
00:14:34,557 --> 00:14:38,653
Wipe me. Oh, oh, please, wipe me.

184
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:43,856
-Give me that stupid contract.
-Yes, sir. A very mature decision.

185
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:46,467
<i>Enjoy a world that's entirely bug free</i>

186
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:50,662
<i>Just sign right here</i>
<i>And leave the killing to me</i>

187
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:52,773
I wrote that.

188
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:09,814
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

189
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,018
Spindle? Spindle?

190
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:17,365
Spindle. You saved it.

191
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:19,694
Oh, well, come here.

192
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:22,860
Well, someone's getting
an extra moldy root tonight.

193
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:25,165
-Okay, okay.
-Zoc.

194
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,277
Spindle, light.

195
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:40,449
-Mother, help us.
-Oh, no.

196
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:44,354
To attack without provocation,
without reason...

197
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:48,724
...just because they can, it's--
It's barbaric.

198
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,897
But what can we do?

199
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,598
We are lost.

200
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:58,129
No. We are saved.

201
00:15:58,307 --> 00:16:01,435
This is our salvation.

202
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,737
A potion?

203
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:08,474
What exactly does it do?

204
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:41,739
Hey. Hey, hey.

205
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:04,529
Human. Come with us.

206
00:18:10,305 --> 00:18:12,535
Shoo. Shoo. Get away. Get away.

207
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,836
I got a fan. I'm windy.

208
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:18,507
I am windy.

209
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:24,351
Hello?

210
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,385
Hello?

211
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:31,191
Hello?

212
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:36,956
Scanning. Scanning. Scanning.

213
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,724
Stop! Hey, come on! Cut it out!

214
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:43,429
What are you doing out of bed,
tiny Lucas?

215
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:56,982
Who are you? What did you do to me?
Let me go!

216
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,805
Gross. Hey, cut it out.

217
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:47,866
Put me down! Hey. Stop. Put me down.

218
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,169
Put me down!

219
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:01,809
What is that? Oh, he smells.

220
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:05,351
-It's the human.
-It's Peanut, the Destroyer.

221
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:09,556
Oh, my.

222
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:12,819
-All right, Peanut, this way.
-It's small.

223
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:14,360
-What is it?
-Touch it.

224
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:15,518
-Don't touch it.
-Hey.

225
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:18,666
-Poke it.
-He's so soft.

226
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:23,237
-His skeleton is on the inside.
-He's inside out?

227
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:32,809
Where are you taking me? Help!

228
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:37,709
Who are you? What did you do to me?
Let me go!

229
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,751
Human...

230
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:45,493
...you have been brought
before the council...

231
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:49,461
...to face judgment
for crimes against the colony.

232
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:50,893
Read the charges.

233
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,998
"This human-destructor beast...

234
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,502
...hereafter referred to
as Peanut the Destroyer...

235
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,369
...did willfully
and with malice aforethought...

236
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,204
...crush the food-storage chambers...

237
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:05,778
...flood all of the lower
hatching chambers...

238
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:11,545
...and douse the colony
with the dreaded yellow rain."

239
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,745
Hey, come on, I had to go.

240
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,389
Sentencing of the human
will be handed down...

241
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,222
...by the queen herself.

242
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:34,038
Greetings, my children...

243
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:38,578
...and to our unusual guest...

244
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:44,014
...a human that threatens
the very existence of our colony.

245
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:47,155
Wait a second! Wait, wait, wait.
Time out.

246
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:51,554
How was I supposed to know
ants had feelings or families or trials?

247
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,493
-You're just a bunch of stupid ants.
-Destroy the Destroyer!

248
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:58,224
-Throw him in the pit.
-Let's eat him!

249
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,131
No, wait. We are not mindless savages.

250
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:04,431
This human should be studied.

251
00:22:04,606 --> 00:22:06,198
-And then we'll eat him.
-Yeah.

252
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,401
Eat! Eat! Eat!

253
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:12,405
Order. Order.

254
00:22:12,814 --> 00:22:14,975
Be still, be still.

255
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,779
Tonight we have a choice.

256
00:22:18,954 --> 00:22:24,324
We could destroy this human
and make safe this day.

257
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:29,294
Or we could change
the nature of this human...

258
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:35,130
...and perhaps create
a brighter future for all ants.

259
00:22:35,303 --> 00:22:40,400
I therefore sentence the human
to live and work in the colony...

260
00:22:40,575 --> 00:22:45,672
...to learn our ways.
He must become an ant.

261
00:22:46,415 --> 00:22:49,816
-What?
-No. No, my queen.

262
00:22:50,252 --> 00:22:54,382
What if he does not become an ant?

263
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:56,854
Okay, I mean, come on.

264
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:59,887
That would be regrettable.

265
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,856
But-- But who will teach him our ways?

266
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,491
-I will.
-Hova?

267
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:09,136
It is done.

268
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,364
Let us continue our work.

269
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,133
That's it?
How long am I gonna be like this?

270
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,573
I wanna go home.

271
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:19,509
Wait. This is inhuman.

272
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:23,143
Yes, it is.

273
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:28,215
Hello, Peanut?

274
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,049
Destroyer?

275
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,826
Hello? We have to go.

276
00:23:34,463 --> 00:23:36,897
It's time to start your training.

277
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,733
Where are you?

278
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,365
Okay, okay. It's simple.

279
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,600
All I have to do is run past the guards,
then escape the anthill...

280
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:51,769
-...and not get eaten by anything.
-Well, hello there.

281
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:54,279
You know, there's a million things
I wanna ask you.

282
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:57,441
When were you hatched?
Are you--? Are you male or female?

283
00:23:57,986 --> 00:23:59,578
And how do you tell the difference?

284
00:23:59,754 --> 00:24:02,587
Is it--? Oh, is that how?

285
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:07,057
Hey, stop peeking.
Or-- Or I'll stomp on you.

286
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:10,995
Well, I wouldn't if I were you.
You see, I'm the only friend you've got.

287
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:12,292
You're gonna eat me.

288
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,932
You know, now that you mention it,
you do look soft and chewy...

289
00:24:16,104 --> 00:24:18,572
...but I promised the queen I wouldn't.

290
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:21,236
Cross your heart.

291
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:23,036
What? Oh, all right.

292
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,202
Cross my heart, I will not eat you.

293
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:28,142
I said, cross your heart, not your butt.

294
00:24:28,316 --> 00:24:30,113
I just did.

295
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:32,515
See, there, did it again.

296
00:24:32,687 --> 00:24:33,915
Strange custom.

297
00:24:34,322 --> 00:24:35,789
I'm still not going.

298
00:24:35,957 --> 00:24:38,892
-Peanut, you need to--
-My name's Lucas, not Peanut.

299
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,789
Lucas.

300
00:24:40,962 --> 00:24:43,988
Well, Lucas. You heard the queen.

301
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:46,862
You must become an ant
if you ever want to return home.

302
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:48,969
And how am I supposed to do that?

303
00:24:49,137 --> 00:24:51,662
Well, you just have
to find your place in the colony.

304
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,678
So, Lucas,
do you have any special skills?

305
00:25:05,854 --> 00:25:08,322
I can make milk come out
of my sister's nose.

306
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,290
Okay, well, let's try foraging.

307
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,451
The instructor
is a personal friend of mine.

308
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:16,756
I'm sure she'd love to help.

309
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,127
Peanut? The Destroyer?

310
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:21,428
I had to move out
of my nest because of you.

311
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,195
I lost everything.

312
00:25:23,371 --> 00:25:25,635
Took me all morning to rebuild.

313
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:30,471
Hova, don't tell me
that you are mentoring this-- This-- This....

314
00:25:31,012 --> 00:25:32,775
It's Lucas.

315
00:25:34,716 --> 00:25:38,117
Why is he covered in trash? Is he crazy?
Because I don't teach crazy ants.

316
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,813
No, no, no. He calls the trash "clothes."

317
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,015
They like keeping
their gender traits hidden.

318
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:46,884
He's male.

319
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:50,797
Okay, Lucas, you're on the blue team.

320
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,627
-Oh, man. That's not fair.
-Come on.

321
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,826
Hey, hey, hey, quiet.

322
00:25:55,003 --> 00:25:57,631
And suck in that thorax.

323
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:02,140
Like everything in the colony,
foraging is a team effort.

324
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:08,340
In this test, each team must act
as a single unit to avoid obstacles...

325
00:26:08,516 --> 00:26:12,247
...retrieve the sweet rock
and return to the nest.

326
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,480
No ant gets left behind.

327
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,249
First team back wins.

328
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:19,393
Any questions?

329
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:26,059
-Hello, baby.
-Fugax.

330
00:26:26,234 --> 00:26:30,227
Well, isn't it true that scout ants,
such as myself...

331
00:26:30,405 --> 00:26:34,865
...lead an exciting life of adventure
and intrigue.

332
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:38,835
-Fugax!
-While foragers, such as you...

333
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,211
...just walk around and pick up sticks.

334
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:45,847
Questions, anyone?

335
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,182
-Oh, sir?
-The guy with the crooked mandibles.

336
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,880
What kind of adventures?

337
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:52,424
Well, I'm glad you asked.

338
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:55,995
-Fugax.
-Gather round, young scouts.

339
00:26:56,164 --> 00:27:01,693
In my travels, I have journeyed
far beyond the great flat rock.

340
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,762
You mean, the street?

341
00:27:05,273 --> 00:27:08,071
No. The great flat rock...

342
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:13,271
...where the humans
ride in their giant metal cocoons.

343
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:14,944
Cars.

344
00:27:15,784 --> 00:27:17,081
Did I call on you?

345
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:19,516
Who invited Captain Party Pooper?

346
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:21,553
Fugax, meet the Destroyer.

347
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,122
Destroyer?

348
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,390
Now, are there any other--?

349
00:27:35,603 --> 00:27:38,936
Are there any other questions
about your assignment?

350
00:27:39,107 --> 00:27:41,974
Yeah, what's a sweet rock?

351
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:43,667
Go.

352
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,885
-Bridge.
-Stack up.

353
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:53,486
Bridge, hooyah.

354
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:54,883
Come on, Peanut.

355
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:58,184
Hello, I can do it myself.

356
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:04,431
Hey, guys. I think he's dead.

357
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:06,967
I'm not dead.

358
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:09,769
-Ladder.
-Ladder, hooyah.

359
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:12,503
-Come on.
-Grab hold.

360
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:14,642
I don't need your help.

361
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:16,868
I need your help! I need your help!

362
00:28:17,045 --> 00:28:19,240
Bye, losers.

363
00:28:19,814 --> 00:28:21,577
Come on.

364
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,917
-All right.
-Hurry, human.

365
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:28,282
You're gonna make us lose.

366
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,720
Hey. I've only got two legs.

367
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:34,020
Go, Two Legs, go.

368
00:28:34,195 --> 00:28:35,492
Go, Lucas.

369
00:28:35,663 --> 00:28:37,961
-Spring.
-Spring, hooyah.

370
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,067
Hooyah.

371
00:28:41,536 --> 00:28:43,527
Oh, time out.

372
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:45,639
I don't think I can do this--

373
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,967
All right.

374
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:52,304
-Let me off!
-Don't let go!

375
00:28:52,714 --> 00:28:54,375
I'm gonna be sick.

376
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:56,176
Don't let go.

377
00:28:56,351 --> 00:28:58,512
-I'm letting go.
-Don't let go.

378
00:29:01,756 --> 00:29:02,745
He let go.

379
00:29:09,063 --> 00:29:11,793
-A jellybean?
-All right, Lucas.

380
00:29:11,966 --> 00:29:13,695
Good thinking.

381
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:16,266
Slingshot, hooyah.

382
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,174
-All right, Lucas. Good job.
-Yeah, Peanut, you rule.

383
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:30,442
-Come on, we're losing. Let's go.
-Good job, Lucas.

384
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:32,210
-Did we win yet?
-Almost.

385
00:29:32,387 --> 00:29:35,322
We just have to get the sweet rock
over the finish line.

386
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,684
Come on, let's go.

387
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:40,391
Hurry up, Peanut.

388
00:29:40,762 --> 00:29:43,526
Yeah, right.

389
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,598
Hurry, Lucas, climb the wall.

390
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:47,029
Climb fast, Peanut.

391
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,430
They're catching up.

392
00:29:48,837 --> 00:29:50,464
Bye-bye, loser.

393
00:29:50,638 --> 00:29:52,196
Climb the wall.

394
00:29:53,408 --> 00:29:55,205
Come on. Climb the wall.

395
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,003
Come on.

396
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,942
Forget it. This game is rigged.

397
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,106
-Ladder.
-Hooyah.

398
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:06,242
Come on. Let's go. Go, go, go.

399
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:08,389
We got it. We go it. Yeah, man. All right.

400
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:09,989
Red rules.

401
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:13,794
Red team wins.

402
00:30:14,195 --> 00:30:17,028
All right. We did it.

403
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:21,731
Thanks for trying.

404
00:30:33,481 --> 00:30:35,506
Lucas, you did fine, really.

405
00:30:35,683 --> 00:30:38,117
You just need to discover the ant within.

406
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:40,652
Start by visualizing yourself with six legs.

407
00:30:40,822 --> 00:30:42,915
-Then, if you--
-How's that gonna get me home?

408
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,582
Look at me. I'm not a stupid ant.

409
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,594
Lucas, being an ant means more
than just having six legs or--

410
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:53,131
Or lifting 10 times your own weight
or walking vertically up a wall...

411
00:30:53,301 --> 00:30:56,828
...it's being part of a colony.
Not always thinking of yourself first.

412
00:30:57,005 --> 00:30:59,303
-Oh, careful.
-Hey, don't touch me.

413
00:30:59,474 --> 00:31:01,533
I'm trying to help you.

414
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:03,074
You think this is easy for me?

415
00:31:03,244 --> 00:31:05,474
Being the Destroyer's little helper?

416
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:09,515
So you worry about you,
and I'll worry about me.

417
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:11,579
Oh, Lucas.

418
00:31:11,753 --> 00:31:13,380
That's not the way ants are.

419
00:31:13,555 --> 00:31:16,786
Oh, Hova, that's the way I am.

420
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,722
Well, if I could just--

421
00:31:21,496 --> 00:31:22,690
Just what?

422
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:26,292
Hello? Earth to ant lady.

423
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,799
You were in the middle
of sounding like my mom.

424
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,670
They're coming. Run!

425
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,708
Hey. Hey! What's wrong?

426
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,477
-They're after the herd.
-What herd?

427
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:47,343
Whoa, easy, girl.

428
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:49,251
Easy.

429
00:31:51,693 --> 00:31:53,388
Take cover.

430
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,022
Tell the queen I love her.

431
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,157
Oh, we're cut off.

432
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:09,308
Come, brothers, for queen and colony.

433
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,050
Get to the grass.

434
00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:20,918
Attack formation.

435
00:32:21,322 --> 00:32:23,085
Load them up.

436
00:32:25,627 --> 00:32:28,619
-Enemy fire.
-Watch your wing. Watch your wing.

437
00:32:28,796 --> 00:32:30,923
-Now, that's gotta sting.
-Nice shot.

438
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:33,966
My turn.

439
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:36,233
-Thanks.
-Where's Hova?

440
00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:38,133
I don't know.

441
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:39,897
Come on.

442
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:42,902
To your positions. Ready.

443
00:32:44,812 --> 00:32:46,404
Squirt.

444
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,953
Don't.
Please, I was just following orders.

445
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,588
Who wants magic?

446
00:33:00,762 --> 00:33:02,457
Clacktiel.

447
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,001
You look tasty.

448
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,569
Leave him alone.

449
00:33:13,474 --> 00:33:15,738
Hova? Oh, quick, get out of my way.

450
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,070
Move.

451
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,611
-Hova.
-Hurry.

452
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:21,180
Everyone, into the grass.

453
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:23,741
Don't just stand there. Help her.

454
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,549
Lucas, run.

455
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:27,915
What are you doing?

456
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,950
Everyone, into the grass.

457
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,620
Where are you...

458
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,688
...little bug?

459
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,510
Please, hurry up. Light, light.

460
00:34:28,082 --> 00:34:30,346
Light, light.

461
00:34:40,928 --> 00:34:42,020
Hova, get down.

462
00:34:43,097 --> 00:34:44,724
Zoc.

463
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:51,966
No!

464
00:34:53,407 --> 00:34:54,897
Stop, hey! No, no.

465
00:35:04,986 --> 00:35:06,283
Fire in the hole!

466
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:17,524
-What was that?
-It's bath time.

467
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,790
Retreat.

468
00:35:30,812 --> 00:35:31,938
They're leaving.

469
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:33,410
We-- We won.

470
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,375
All hail the Destroyer.

471
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,987
Peanut! Peanut!

472
00:35:41,155 --> 00:35:42,588
Brilliant. Genius.

473
00:35:42,757 --> 00:35:44,247
I mean, Lucas made a:

474
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:46,893
And then...they all flew away.

475
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,325
And now I know
why they call you Peanut.

476
00:35:49,497 --> 00:35:52,830
He's got a brain the size of a peanut.

477
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,661
Lucas the Destroyer.

478
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,731
I take back everything
I thought about you.

479
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,429
You saved us.

480
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:01,900
Thank you, Lucas.

481
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,806
Yeah, sure.

482
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:07,912
He saved us.

483
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:11,950
Oh, it's so obvious, I was so dumb.

484
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,644
Praise the Destroyer.

485
00:36:14,822 --> 00:36:17,154
Wake up. He saved himself.

486
00:36:18,192 --> 00:36:19,352
The rest of us just--

487
00:36:20,228 --> 00:36:22,458
Just got in the way.

488
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,091
Zoc. Oh, are you all right?

489
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,733
-No, I'm--
-What happened to you?

490
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:28,425
I'm fine. I'm fine.

491
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,867
-You're hurt.
-No, it's nothing, really, I just--

492
00:36:31,038 --> 00:36:32,869
Zoc, do you have any yucca sap?

493
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,271
Lucas has a burn. Poor baby.

494
00:36:37,211 --> 00:36:40,044
This is our enemy.

495
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,975
They do not save ants, they kill ants.

496
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:46,619
He very nearly killed me.

497
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,783
Or does that not matter to you?

498
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:02,825
<i>I do, you do</i>
<i>We all like the honeydew</i>

499
00:37:03,004 --> 00:37:04,494
Dinner is served.

500
00:37:04,672 --> 00:37:06,139
And I'm the dessert.

501
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,901
And I'm on a low-fathead diet.

502
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:11,408
And you know, it looks good on you.

503
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:13,308
So, Lucas, what are you working on?

504
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,470
Glasses.

505
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,817
This is some good honeydew.

506
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:25,225
Oh, Lucas, you have to try some.
It's so good.

507
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,154
Go ahead.

508
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:34,931
This is awesome.

509
00:37:35,102 --> 00:37:37,593
Tastes like green-apple bubble gum.

510
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,612
That went away quick.
Another round for you?

511
00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:48,248
Oh, yeah, keep it coming.

512
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,458
Get it while it's hot.

513
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:11,534
Whoa, I didn't know
humans could change their colors.

514
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,571
-Trippy.
-Perhaps our young pupa...

515
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:16,175
...ate too much honeydew.

516
00:38:21,248 --> 00:38:22,875
Here, eat this.

517
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,415
It'll make you feel better.

518
00:38:25,753 --> 00:38:27,914
What did that come out of?

519
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,853
It's an alka root.

520
00:38:30,024 --> 00:38:34,051
Zoc discovered its powers to expel evil
and create well-being.

521
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:37,289
He is a great wizard.

522
00:38:37,465 --> 00:38:39,490
Yeah, he hates me.

523
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,191
Whoa, he really does, doesn't he?

524
00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:43,064
I mean, he hates your guts.

525
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,933
It's actually amazing
how much he hates your guts.

526
00:38:46,107 --> 00:38:47,369
Okay, I'm sorry.

527
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:51,375
Yes, Zoc has anger issues,
especially towards humans...

528
00:38:51,545 --> 00:38:53,012
...but he's a true ant.

529
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,440
Hard on the outside,
but soft on the inside.

530
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:59,342
Just give him time, Lucas.

531
00:39:17,638 --> 00:39:19,105
Praise the Mother.

532
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:22,332
Praise the Mother.

533
00:39:23,744 --> 00:39:25,336
Thanks.

534
00:39:25,513 --> 00:39:28,038
Who is this mother
you keep talking about, anyway?

535
00:39:28,215 --> 00:39:29,273
Is it the queen?

536
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,714
No, Lucas, the Ant Mother.

537
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,711
The queen of queens.

538
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,686
She gave birth to the first colony.

539
00:39:36,857 --> 00:39:39,587
To all ants.

540
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,196
Come on. It's time for you to see.

541
00:39:58,379 --> 00:40:02,748
This is the Chamber of the Ages.

542
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:07,554
What are these?

543
00:40:07,922 --> 00:40:11,449
They tell the story
of our colony, our history.

544
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,923
These are pretty cool.

545
00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:28,673
This is the image of the Ant Mother.

546
00:40:31,612 --> 00:40:34,706
It is said that one day she will return...

547
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:38,750
...and honeydew will pour
from the sky like rain.

548
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:42,286
Then we will never go hungry again.

549
00:40:42,456 --> 00:40:45,118
So you actually want warm poop
to fall from the sky?

550
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:48,955
Yes. That would be a blessed day.

551
00:40:49,396 --> 00:40:52,263
I'm sorry, it's just so beautiful.

552
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,362
Hey, what's that one?

553
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,231
It's the evil one.

554
00:40:57,938 --> 00:40:59,872
The Cloudbreather.

555
00:41:00,241 --> 00:41:03,335
It is ancient, drawn before our time.

556
00:41:03,511 --> 00:41:08,915
No one knows for sure what it is,
except that death is said to follow it.

557
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:12,314
I think it's just a story used
to scare naughty pupas into behaving.

558
00:41:13,587 --> 00:41:16,317
No, the exterminator.

559
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,787
l-- I gotta cancel him.

560
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:19,391
I gotta go home now.

561
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,925
But you're not an ant yet.

562
00:41:21,328 --> 00:41:23,319
-Just a quick visit.
-No way, Two Legs.

563
00:41:23,497 --> 00:41:25,488
The humans' nest is strictly forbidden.

564
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,000
Well...

565
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:30,895
...the colony needs food, right?

566
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,595
Food?

567
00:41:32,773 --> 00:41:35,571
Yeah, sweet rocks.
My house is filled with them.

568
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:39,201
-In assorted colors and flavors.
-Assorted flavors?

569
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,642
Even the greenies?

570
00:41:40,814 --> 00:41:43,339
Well, you'll be needing a scout.

571
00:41:43,517 --> 00:41:45,417
No. There is no way
you're gonna get me--

572
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,077
-I'm in.
-Come on.

573
00:41:49,156 --> 00:41:51,454
Better be some red ones.

574
00:41:54,995 --> 00:41:57,225
Wow, this is a big nest.

575
00:41:57,398 --> 00:42:00,162
Must have taken thousands
of humans to build this.

576
00:42:00,334 --> 00:42:02,529
-What's that?
-It's just the door.

577
00:42:02,703 --> 00:42:05,194
A door? Fantastic.

578
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,836
Do all of your guests
pass under this door?

579
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:11,842
Well, actually, you guys
are the first friends I've had over.

580
00:42:12,012 --> 00:42:13,741
We are the first ones?

581
00:42:13,914 --> 00:42:16,644
Kreela, we're the first ones
to pass under the door.

582
00:42:16,817 --> 00:42:18,944
-Great.
-And to think...

583
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,555
...all of this is made from your own poop.

584
00:42:22,856 --> 00:42:24,016
Nice.

585
00:42:25,326 --> 00:42:28,727
Oh, why did Mom
have to get shag carpet?

586
00:42:28,896 --> 00:42:31,626
lt'll take days to get to the kitchen.

587
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:35,291
Oh, gee, that is too bad.

588
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:39,269
I guess now we'll have to go home
before we all get in trouble.

589
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,037
No.

590
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:45,906
Wait.

591
00:42:50,117 --> 00:42:51,379
Come on.

592
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:53,383
This is called hang-gliding.

593
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,890
Have you ever done this, actually?

594
00:42:58,058 --> 00:42:59,286
I played the video game.

595
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,985
Now, when I give the word,
everybody jump.

596
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,724
Now.

597
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:13,066
Oh, sorry, was that the word?

598
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,401
-Coming.
-Hey, hey, look out.

599
00:43:15,576 --> 00:43:18,602
For queen and colony.

600
00:43:18,779 --> 00:43:20,838
Oh, God.

601
00:43:26,287 --> 00:43:30,485
-Showoff.
-Awesome. Yeah.

602
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,687
This is Hawaii.
We went there last summer.

603
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:38,195
It's got volcanoes and hula dancers
and Don Ho and surfboards.

604
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,957
And I caught a fish.

605
00:43:41,335 --> 00:43:44,031
And these are the pyramids.
Well, not the real pyramids.

606
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:47,037
The real ones are lots bigger.
Mommo says aliens built them.

607
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,538
She's my grandma.

608
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,049
Oh, are these your nest mates?

609
00:44:00,454 --> 00:44:02,922
Yeah, that's my family.

610
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,216
Which one's the queen?

611
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:07,087
My sister thinks she is.

612
00:44:08,128 --> 00:44:09,425
What's wrong?

613
00:44:09,596 --> 00:44:12,759
Nothing. It's just, well....

614
00:44:14,101 --> 00:44:17,127
I should have told
my mom goodbye. That's all.

615
00:44:17,771 --> 00:44:20,638
I can be a real jerk sometimes.

616
00:44:21,442 --> 00:44:23,933
-Lucas, your face is leaking.
-Leaking?

617
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:26,978
Oh, no, it's okay.

618
00:44:27,147 --> 00:44:29,411
Is that what humans do
when they're sad?

619
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,073
They leak from the face?

620
00:44:31,618 --> 00:44:35,213
When ants are sad, we do this:

621
00:44:55,008 --> 00:44:58,000
Oh, Lucas, it's-- It's--

622
00:44:58,178 --> 00:45:00,169
It's beautiful!

623
00:45:01,548 --> 00:45:04,176
Sweet rocks, come to papa!

624
00:45:22,002 --> 00:45:22,991
Red one.

625
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,798
What are you doing?
Why aren't you taking the red ones?

626
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:29,136
Well, it's actually
quite simple, sugar lips.

627
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,708
I hate the red ones.

628
00:45:30,878 --> 00:45:32,971
Well, I love the red ones.

629
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,637
-Hate them.
-I love them!

630
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,510
-Hate, hate, hate.
-Love. Love.

631
00:45:36,683 --> 00:45:39,516
-Admit it, you find me attractive.
-What?

632
00:45:39,686 --> 00:45:42,416
Oh, how you tease me
with your sweet talk.

633
00:45:42,589 --> 00:45:44,853
Oh, you want some sweet talk?

634
00:45:45,025 --> 00:45:47,289
Because I'll give you some sweet talk.

635
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:49,895
Now grab a red one
before I pull these off.

636
00:45:50,063 --> 00:45:51,655
Whoa, I need those.

637
00:45:53,534 --> 00:45:55,092
What are we doing?

638
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:57,100
Nothing, nothing.

639
00:46:17,257 --> 00:46:20,055
-Mommo, I'm back!
-What was that?

640
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:23,191
-Tiffany.
-What's a Tiffany?

641
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,762
-Hurry up!
-Right.

642
00:46:24,932 --> 00:46:26,593
Leave the red ones behind!

643
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:28,530
Fugax!

644
00:46:30,437 --> 00:46:32,769
Hey, pipsqueak, you there?

645
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,703
Hello?

646
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,638
<i>Crossfire!</i>

647
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:40,969
That kid and his stupid electronic toys.

648
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,576
What is he doing?

649
00:46:46,753 --> 00:46:49,051
Jumping. You know,
hippity hop, uppity downy?

650
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,214
It's a scout thing.
You wouldn't understand.

651
00:46:51,592 --> 00:46:53,526
Okay, come on. One more.

652
00:46:53,694 --> 00:46:54,718
I just need a seven.

653
00:46:58,332 --> 00:47:01,927
-Hello. How are you?
-Hi.

654
00:47:02,102 --> 00:47:04,036
Pizza Kingdom. Hail to the king.

655
00:47:04,204 --> 00:47:08,004
Would you like to try our new
Princess Pepperoni with tangy Jester Sauce?

656
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:10,536
Hello! This is Lucas Nickle!

657
00:47:10,711 --> 00:47:12,838
I need to cancel my order!

658
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:16,773
<i>What?</i>

659
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,281
You don't want to order?

660
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,748
Please cancel the contract!

661
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:27,690
-<i>No exterminator!</i>
-No extra tomato. Got it.

662
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,725
Yes. No exterminator.

663
00:47:31,899 --> 00:47:33,867
I'm canceling the contract.

664
00:47:34,034 --> 00:47:36,969
What? You-- You wanna cancel?

665
00:47:37,137 --> 00:47:38,126
Who is this?

666
00:47:38,305 --> 00:47:40,170
Oh, Bill, is this you, man?

667
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,537
You got me, man. You got me, dude.

668
00:47:45,412 --> 00:47:46,640
That's a relief.

669
00:47:46,813 --> 00:47:50,340
Okay, Lucas, I don't understand
most of what just happened.

670
00:47:50,517 --> 00:47:51,984
What is an exterminator?

671
00:47:52,152 --> 00:47:56,054
Oh, don't worry. Everything's okay now.

672
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,124
Hide!

673
00:48:08,435 --> 00:48:11,268
This is Tiff. Hi, Mom.

674
00:48:11,438 --> 00:48:14,669
Yeah, everything's fine.
Lucas is being a pest.

675
00:48:16,376 --> 00:48:17,673
He's in his room playing...

676
00:48:17,844 --> 00:48:19,573
-...those stupid video games.
-No, no!

677
00:48:20,247 --> 00:48:22,681
I will. I will. Okay, Mom.

678
00:48:23,116 --> 00:48:28,179
Yes. I'm hugging the phone too. Bye.

679
00:48:33,927 --> 00:48:35,861
You must be Queen Tiffany.

680
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:37,587
Allow me to introduce--

681
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:51,939
Remember your training.

682
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,373
Oh, no. No, no, no! Mother!

683
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:02,121
<i>We're sorry. Your call</i>
<i>cannot be completed as dialed.</i>

684
00:49:02,288 --> 00:49:03,915
Hello?

685
00:49:04,924 --> 00:49:07,392
Tiffany, no! You'll squish Lucas.

686
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,858
Hello. Nobody's shrunk.
Gotta go. Bye-bye.

687
00:49:10,029 --> 00:49:11,291
What are you talking about?

688
00:49:11,464 --> 00:49:14,194
Lucas! You let him go. It's me you want.

689
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:20,135
Come back. Probe me instead. Lucas!

690
00:49:22,976 --> 00:49:26,002
Bring back Lucas, you alien scum!

691
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:28,170
Oh, Lucas. Lucas.

692
00:49:28,348 --> 00:49:29,747
-Okay, Mommo.
-Lucas.

693
00:49:29,916 --> 00:49:33,113
Let's go find your other teeth.

694
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:55,207
Hova, where are you?

695
00:50:06,386 --> 00:50:10,447
Hova? Hova! Are you all right?

696
00:50:11,024 --> 00:50:13,356
Are we all right? Of course.
Why wouldn't we be?

697
00:50:13,526 --> 00:50:16,427
We're fine. We're all right. Silly.

698
00:50:17,263 --> 00:50:19,231
Whoa, whoa, wait.
No, wait, now, hold up.

699
00:50:19,399 --> 00:50:21,560
Zoc! Zoc, guess what we did?

700
00:50:21,734 --> 00:50:23,827
We went to Hawaii.
We saw the pyramids.

701
00:50:24,003 --> 00:50:25,402
We flew without wings.

702
00:50:25,571 --> 00:50:27,163
At first, it was like:

703
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,864
But then it was:

704
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:32,375
Of course, the others were terrified,
so I took charge. And then we....

705
00:50:32,545 --> 00:50:34,979
We were inside the humans' nest.

706
00:50:35,148 --> 00:50:38,174
Humans' nest? That's forbidden!

707
00:50:38,351 --> 00:50:39,443
Right, right.

708
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,452
But the nest was filled
with sweet rocks, okay.

709
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,112
Lots of them.

710
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:48,386
But then Queen Tiffany started swatting,
some massive flying teeth attacked us...

711
00:50:48,561 --> 00:50:51,325
...and, well, here we are.
What a day. Good night.

712
00:50:51,497 --> 00:50:54,955
And who told you
about these sweet rocks?

713
00:50:55,134 --> 00:50:58,365
-Lucas, of course.
-Really?

714
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,008
Hi, there. How are you?

715
00:51:04,544 --> 00:51:07,377
-Okay.
-Okay. That's good.

716
00:51:07,547 --> 00:51:09,344
It's good to be okay.

717
00:51:09,515 --> 00:51:14,214
Listen, I just wanted
to show you something, if that's okay.

718
00:51:15,288 --> 00:51:17,279
You know what this is?

719
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:21,390
This is the potion that will
make you big again.

720
00:51:21,694 --> 00:51:25,596
I just wanted you to take
a good, long look at it.

721
00:51:26,065 --> 00:51:28,829
Because this is the last time
you will ever see it.

722
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:31,502
What do you mean?

723
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:35,937
I mean, there is no way I am ever
going to make you big again.

724
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:42,647
Ever. You are a threat
to every ant in this colony.

725
00:51:42,815 --> 00:51:44,749
Especially to Hova.

726
00:51:44,917 --> 00:51:47,351
But I would never do anything
to hurt Hova.

727
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,580
I just-- l--

728
00:51:50,757 --> 00:51:52,748
I just wanna go home.

729
00:51:52,925 --> 00:51:54,517
Well, then, if I were you...

730
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:59,996
...l'd try to find help somewhere else,
because there is nothing for you here.

731
00:52:02,335 --> 00:52:03,700
Nothing.

732
00:52:15,615 --> 00:52:17,606
The pain, the pain! It's unbearable.

733
00:52:17,784 --> 00:52:19,274
Just put me out of my misery!

734
00:52:19,452 --> 00:52:21,147
Oh, hold still, you big pupa.

735
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,652
I haven't even touched you yet.

736
00:52:24,824 --> 00:52:26,758
Be gentle with me.

737
00:52:36,002 --> 00:52:38,470
-Where's Lucas?
-Isn't he with you?

738
00:52:38,704 --> 00:52:43,903
-No.
-Lucas? Lucas? That's weird.

739
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:47,668
Well, he's probably off destroying
some other poor, unfortunate colony.

740
00:52:47,847 --> 00:52:49,838
You know how they are. Destroyers.

741
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:51,915
Zoc, what have you done?

742
00:52:52,084 --> 00:52:55,247
-Me? What did I do?
-Where is he?

743
00:52:55,421 --> 00:52:56,854
He's gone.

744
00:52:57,023 --> 00:53:00,117
-He led you into a trap, Hova.
-There was no trap.

745
00:53:00,293 --> 00:53:03,490
He led us to food.
He was trying to protect us from....

746
00:53:03,663 --> 00:53:06,097
-From what? What, Hova?
-From something.

747
00:53:06,265 --> 00:53:07,732
Oh, something!

748
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,959
And I was worried it was from nothing.

749
00:53:10,136 --> 00:53:11,763
He's blinded you, Hova.

750
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,202
No, you are the one who's blind.

751
00:53:14,373 --> 00:53:17,604
You are so consumed
by your hatred for the humans...

752
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:21,008
-...you see only what you want to see.
-Oh, come on.

753
00:53:21,314 --> 00:53:25,148
Zoc, I see a young pupa,
a human learning our ways...

754
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:29,015
...becoming part of this colony,
becoming an ant.

755
00:53:29,322 --> 00:53:31,620
-Impossible.
-Listen to yourself, Zoc.

756
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:35,386
"A wizard knows no such word."
So, what are you now?

757
00:53:35,661 --> 00:53:38,129
Certainly not the ant I love.

758
00:53:38,498 --> 00:53:40,022
Hova!

759
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:42,895
I did it for you, for the colony.

760
00:53:43,069 --> 00:53:45,230
You did it for yourself.

761
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:47,567
Hova, I....

762
00:53:49,775 --> 00:53:51,640
He won't make it
through the night alone.

763
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,836
Fugax, your leg's broken.

764
00:53:54,013 --> 00:53:56,345
Yeah, but I still have five good ones.

765
00:53:56,516 --> 00:53:58,450
Very good ones.

766
00:53:58,618 --> 00:54:02,145
You know, I believe he was trying
to protect us from something.

767
00:54:02,388 --> 00:54:04,379
See you, Zoc.

768
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,038
Maybe Zoc is right.

769
00:54:29,315 --> 00:54:32,216
Now I'll never get home.

770
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,353
Hi! Nice evening, huh?

771
00:54:37,523 --> 00:54:38,547
Oh, may I?

772
00:54:39,425 --> 00:54:40,551
Sure, help yourself.

773
00:54:40,726 --> 00:54:44,685
Thanks, I love water! I'm a beetle
that loves water, but I'm not a water beetle.

774
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,526
Isn't that funny? I'm a beetle--

775
00:55:24,837 --> 00:55:26,327
Hey, Lucas.

776
00:55:27,373 --> 00:55:30,865
Hey, anybody know what...means?

777
00:55:31,577 --> 00:55:33,977
I think I just figured it out.

778
00:55:34,981 --> 00:55:36,073
Croaker!

779
00:55:39,619 --> 00:55:40,916
This way!

780
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,588
Don't ever leave me again.

781
00:55:49,762 --> 00:55:52,094
-But Zoc told me--
-You are my pupa, not Zoc's.

782
00:55:55,701 --> 00:55:57,191
Lucas, come on.

783
00:56:03,142 --> 00:56:06,771
Climb! You can do it. Just concentrate.

784
00:56:07,913 --> 00:56:09,676
I'm an ant. Okay, I'm an ant.

785
00:56:09,849 --> 00:56:12,909
-He's got it. He's got it.
-Look, I'm an ant!

786
00:56:13,085 --> 00:56:15,952
He hasn't got it.

787
00:56:23,696 --> 00:56:25,687
Grab hold!

788
00:56:27,533 --> 00:56:29,296
Hova?

789
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:33,338
Lucas!

790
00:56:47,286 --> 00:56:50,585
Wow, we came right
down that guy's throat, didn't we?

791
00:56:50,756 --> 00:56:52,451
Hey, smiley, you're on my wing.

792
00:56:52,625 --> 00:56:54,593
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

793
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,227
So, what do you guys do?

794
00:56:56,395 --> 00:56:59,421
I'm a glowworm. I glow.

795
00:56:59,598 --> 00:57:00,792
That's great!

796
00:57:00,966 --> 00:57:03,457
You're really starting
to irritate me. Can you--?

797
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:10,642
Oh, gross.

798
00:57:10,876 --> 00:57:13,640
Will you quit eating, fatso?

799
00:57:13,813 --> 00:57:15,781
It's cramped in here.
There's no more room!

800
00:57:15,948 --> 00:57:20,681
Don't worry. I'm afraid we will be
moving along in due course.

801
00:57:20,853 --> 00:57:22,480
Always with the negative with you.

802
00:57:22,655 --> 00:57:26,022
Why can't you be more-- Hey, Lenny!

803
00:57:26,425 --> 00:57:27,858
This is what I'm talking about.

804
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:31,326
Lenny always has a smile on his face--

805
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,864
Let me out! Let me out!

806
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:39,061
-I don't wanna be a toadstool!
-"A toadstool." That's great.

807
00:57:39,238 --> 00:57:40,830
-You like that?
-That's very funny.

808
00:57:41,006 --> 00:57:43,099
There's plenty more
where that came from, pal.

809
00:57:43,275 --> 00:57:45,140
I like-- Hi, what's your name?

810
00:57:45,311 --> 00:57:47,404
There he goes again.

811
00:57:48,681 --> 00:57:50,774
Stop! Come back!

812
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,349
-Hova!
-No!

813
00:57:52,518 --> 00:57:55,043
Hova, he's gone.

814
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,452
Croaker, over here. This way!

815
00:57:58,624 --> 00:57:59,818
-Zoc!
-Zoc!

816
00:57:59,992 --> 00:58:02,153
I am delicious, eat me.

817
00:58:02,328 --> 00:58:04,455
Zoc, are you crazy?

818
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:07,258
-He's crazy.
-Hey, froggy!

819
00:58:09,301 --> 00:58:12,236
No relationship is worth this.

820
00:58:17,309 --> 00:58:20,938
Oh, sure. Why not? Come on in.

821
00:58:21,113 --> 00:58:24,446
-Welcome to paradise.
-Zoc! How'd you get here?

822
00:58:24,617 --> 00:58:26,847
I sure didn't come in
through the rear entrance.

823
00:58:27,019 --> 00:58:29,647
Welcome. Make yourself at home. Hi.

824
00:58:29,822 --> 00:58:31,312
Who is this? Your ant?

825
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:34,254
Zoc, you are crazy.
You're inside a frog, for Mother's sake.

826
00:58:34,426 --> 00:58:36,257
What are you doing? This is impossible!

827
00:58:36,428 --> 00:58:39,158
"Listen to yourself, Zoc.
A wizard knows no such word.

828
00:58:39,331 --> 00:58:41,595
So, what are you now?"

829
00:58:43,636 --> 00:58:45,001
Weirdo.

830
00:58:45,805 --> 00:58:47,534
What does she see in you?

831
00:58:47,706 --> 00:58:50,607
-What does she see in you?
-Exactly!

832
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,172
Not me.

833
00:58:56,549 --> 00:58:59,848
-Hey, is that...?
-Alka root? So it is.

834
00:59:02,955 --> 00:59:04,183
-Oh, no.
-Oh, my.

835
00:59:07,593 --> 00:59:09,527
You might wanna let go of that.

836
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:12,562
Oh, no. So you can grab it?
I don't think so.

837
00:59:12,731 --> 00:59:15,700
-Hands in the air.
-Oh, my.

838
00:59:20,739 --> 00:59:22,536
Wow, that was great!

839
00:59:22,708 --> 00:59:25,506
Hey, we sure owe you one!
Thanks a lot!

840
00:59:25,945 --> 00:59:29,210
I'm free! I'm free!

841
00:59:30,482 --> 00:59:33,007
Oh, crap.

842
00:59:35,821 --> 00:59:39,120
Hey, Zoc, thanks. But why'd you do it?

843
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:42,727
An ant will sacrifice himself
for his friends.

844
00:59:42,895 --> 00:59:46,160
-I thought you hated me.
-I didn't do it for you.

845
01:00:01,413 --> 01:00:03,745
All right, well, we should
camp here for the night.

846
01:00:03,916 --> 01:00:06,476
Come on, Fugax. Let's forage some food.

847
01:00:06,652 --> 01:00:09,587
Excuse me? I don't forage.

848
01:00:09,755 --> 01:00:12,155
I'll scout for food.

849
01:00:12,324 --> 01:00:13,791
Right, let's go.

850
01:00:14,126 --> 01:00:16,026
Zoc, stay with Lucas.

851
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,753
He's been through a lot today.

852
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:20,831
-Hova, please, don't ask me to--
-He's not what you think.

853
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,831
There is goodness in him.

854
01:00:23,002 --> 01:00:25,732
There's an ant in him.

855
01:00:26,272 --> 01:00:29,002
See, he really is trying.

856
01:00:29,174 --> 01:00:30,869
Come on. You can do it.

857
01:00:31,143 --> 01:00:35,307
-Concentrate.
-One, two, three.

858
01:00:35,514 --> 01:00:39,712
Think ant. Ant. Ant.

859
01:00:40,886 --> 01:00:43,116
Yeah, all right.

860
01:00:44,757 --> 01:00:46,622
Craznocks.

861
01:00:55,901 --> 01:00:57,198
It's funny.

862
01:00:57,369 --> 01:01:00,668
The sky looks exactly the same.

863
01:01:00,839 --> 01:01:03,239
Everything else is so different...

864
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:06,640
...but it's the same sky, the same stars.

865
01:01:09,114 --> 01:01:10,945
Why must you keep doing that?

866
01:01:11,116 --> 01:01:15,576
-Are you ill?
-What? Oh, you mean yawning.

867
01:01:15,754 --> 01:01:19,087
-I'm just tired.
-Please stop. It's disgusting.

868
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:24,386
-Ants don't yawn?
-Definitely not, thank you.

869
01:01:26,465 --> 01:01:30,799
So this city of yours, it's like a nest?

870
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:33,700
Well, yeah. Kind of.

871
01:01:33,872 --> 01:01:36,568
And the humans that live there
are all brothers...

872
01:01:36,742 --> 01:01:39,711
...working together
for the greatness of their colony?

873
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,172
Well, not exactly.

874
01:01:42,348 --> 01:01:47,217
It's a little more like,
you know, every man for himself.

875
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:49,817
But that's so primitive.

876
01:01:49,989 --> 01:01:51,547
How does anything get done?

877
01:01:51,824 --> 01:01:53,655
Some people work together.

878
01:01:53,826 --> 01:01:55,726
Some. Why not all?

879
01:01:56,228 --> 01:01:59,391
I suppose it's because
of their differences.

880
01:01:59,565 --> 01:02:02,159
But it's the differences
that make a colony strong.

881
01:02:02,334 --> 01:02:05,997
Foragers, scouts, drones,
nurses, regurgitators...

882
01:02:06,171 --> 01:02:09,436
...all are different,
but an essential part of the whole.

883
01:02:09,608 --> 01:02:12,076
This is where we ants draw our strength.

884
01:02:13,412 --> 01:02:15,505
My differences just get me beat up.

885
01:02:15,681 --> 01:02:18,343
-And why is that?
-I don't know.

886
01:02:18,851 --> 01:02:22,378
Some humans prefer to clobber people
they don't understand.

887
01:02:22,554 --> 01:02:26,285
Like you prefer to clobber ants.

888
01:02:27,126 --> 01:02:30,289
I guess I didn't think
about what I was doing.

889
01:02:30,462 --> 01:02:32,896
Seems to happen a lot.

890
01:02:35,634 --> 01:02:39,661
I suppose sometimes I, too,
can act without thinking.

891
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:45,739
Perhaps in this way, we are alike.

892
01:02:48,714 --> 01:02:51,012
Good night, Lucas.

893
01:02:51,183 --> 01:02:52,844
Good night, Zoc.

894
01:03:33,325 --> 01:03:35,259
-What's the matter?
-Look!

895
01:03:35,427 --> 01:03:37,486
-What is it? What's wrong?
-I see her!

896
01:03:37,663 --> 01:03:39,460
-Who her?
-The Ant Mother!

897
01:03:39,631 --> 01:03:41,895
She's come! She's here!

898
01:03:44,436 --> 01:03:46,961
Look! Look!

899
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:53,268
What do you know?

900
01:03:54,046 --> 01:03:55,843
There really is an--

901
01:03:58,817 --> 01:04:00,148
No.

902
01:04:10,028 --> 01:04:11,791
Cloudbreather.

903
01:04:11,964 --> 01:04:14,558
But I cancelled the contract.

904
01:04:15,934 --> 01:04:17,697
Praise the Mother!

905
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:19,701
-Praise the Mother!
-She's come at last!

906
01:04:19,972 --> 01:04:23,430
Everyone, please, calm down.

907
01:04:27,813 --> 01:04:31,214
Listen to me! It is not the Ant Mother!

908
01:04:31,383 --> 01:04:34,682
-It is a Cloudbreather!
-It's true.

909
01:04:35,287 --> 01:04:37,687
He's come to wipe out the entire colony.

910
01:04:38,123 --> 01:04:39,715
How can we possibly fight back?

911
01:04:40,125 --> 01:04:41,615
His magic is strong.

912
01:04:44,163 --> 01:04:45,653
Sprayers.

913
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:48,827
Foggers.

914
01:04:49,401 --> 01:04:50,868
Oh, that's the stuff.

915
01:04:51,036 --> 01:04:52,731
Zappers.

916
01:04:53,805 --> 01:04:55,136
Sulfur bombs.

917
01:05:01,847 --> 01:05:05,476
And how do you know of this creature?

918
01:05:05,851 --> 01:05:07,785
Because....

919
01:05:08,687 --> 01:05:11,178
-Because I brought him here.
-Lucas!

920
01:05:11,356 --> 01:05:12,516
I knew it. I told you.

921
01:05:12,691 --> 01:05:16,457
-Guards, remove this human.
-Come on, kid.

922
01:05:16,628 --> 01:05:18,858
-Hova!
-Lucas!

923
01:05:20,766 --> 01:05:23,394
-No.
-Wait. The potion.

924
01:05:23,569 --> 01:05:29,030
That's it! Zoc, you shrunk me.
You can shrink the Cloudbreather.

925
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:32,439
We can load these things up and then:

926
01:05:32,611 --> 01:05:34,078
Right in the ear!

927
01:05:35,214 --> 01:05:37,682
Yes. Yes, perhaps.

928
01:05:37,849 --> 01:05:40,647
But the Cloudbreather
towers above us like a tree.

929
01:05:40,819 --> 01:05:42,411
How do we get close enough?

930
01:05:42,588 --> 01:05:44,112
I've got an idea.

931
01:05:44,289 --> 01:05:49,192
Zoc, you would trust this human?

932
01:05:58,203 --> 01:06:00,398
Yoo-hoo, hello?

933
01:06:00,572 --> 01:06:02,563
We need to talk to you.

934
01:06:03,408 --> 01:06:05,672
Show yourselves.

935
01:06:06,578 --> 01:06:09,945
Down here. Hello?

936
01:06:17,089 --> 01:06:21,423
Well, well, well.
Just in time for lunch.

937
01:06:21,593 --> 01:06:23,322
-Hello.
-Wait.

938
01:06:23,495 --> 01:06:26,089
Listen to me. We come in peace.

939
01:06:26,265 --> 01:06:30,429
The exterminator's here. He brings
death clouds that will destroy us all...

940
01:06:30,602 --> 01:06:32,900
...unless we can work together
to stop him.

941
01:06:33,372 --> 01:06:35,863
Death clouds, huh?

942
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:38,566
Okay, let's eat.

943
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:42,146
Get behind me.

944
01:06:54,726 --> 01:07:00,164
Sir, the east nest, totally destroyed.

945
01:07:00,565 --> 01:07:02,795
The cloud is coming.

946
01:07:03,201 --> 01:07:06,068
The cloud!

947
01:07:18,383 --> 01:07:21,682
What do you have in mind?

948
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:30,653
Remember, you only get one shot at it.

949
01:07:30,829 --> 01:07:35,061
Don't fire until you see
the wax of his ears.

950
01:07:35,233 --> 01:07:37,861
-Understood.
-Ready? Lucas?

951
01:07:38,036 --> 01:07:41,403
-Good to go.
-Hey. Hey. Stop it. Stop it.

952
01:07:41,573 --> 01:07:45,065
Zoc! Can I switch? Mine's broken.

953
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:47,970
All right, boys. Heat them up.

954
01:07:53,618 --> 01:07:56,246
Let's fly.

955
01:08:15,607 --> 01:08:18,940
Hey, that looks fun. Let's help, shall we?

956
01:08:19,111 --> 01:08:22,774
Okay. I only live two weeks anyway.

957
01:08:22,948 --> 01:08:25,246
Good for you.

958
01:08:33,792 --> 01:08:36,955
First wave, attack!

959
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,567
So you want to rumble, huh?
Come on. Come on.

960
01:08:45,737 --> 01:08:47,261
Come on!

961
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:48,906
I'm going in.

962
01:08:58,617 --> 01:09:01,916
I can't get through.
He's got some kind of shield.

963
01:09:02,354 --> 01:09:04,618
Craznocks. Headphones!

964
01:09:28,013 --> 01:09:31,176
For queen and colony!

965
01:09:33,385 --> 01:09:34,613
Yeah.

966
01:09:36,521 --> 01:09:38,751
Why have you stopped?

967
01:09:39,357 --> 01:09:43,418
Oh, geez. Boy, that hurts. Please stop.

968
01:09:43,595 --> 01:09:45,085
Bye-bye.

969
01:09:52,304 --> 01:09:55,967
We'll have to land on him.
Find a way in.

970
01:10:00,378 --> 01:10:03,711
He's reloading! Now's our chance.

971
01:10:08,453 --> 01:10:10,318
Draw!

972
01:10:13,658 --> 01:10:15,421
Zoc!

973
01:10:25,871 --> 01:10:29,204
-Welcome to the scalp.
-Hello.

974
01:10:29,374 --> 01:10:31,706
-Have a slice.
-Enjoy.

975
01:10:33,845 --> 01:10:35,335
Fingers!

976
01:10:35,514 --> 01:10:37,607
He's scratching again!

977
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:41,143
-To the armpit!
-Dive, dive!

978
01:10:47,959 --> 01:10:50,894
Leave my friends alone!

979
01:10:57,135 --> 01:10:59,160
Don't pick your nose.
Don't pick your nose.

980
01:11:05,076 --> 01:11:07,943
-Need a lift?
-Thanks.

981
01:11:26,765 --> 01:11:28,699
No.

982
01:11:29,668 --> 01:11:32,831
Hova, are you okay?

983
01:11:33,004 --> 01:11:34,562
What?

984
01:11:36,207 --> 01:11:37,970
Nighty night.

985
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:40,238
Run!

986
01:11:44,482 --> 01:11:47,747
Come on, get up!
We got to go, we got to go!

987
01:11:47,986 --> 01:11:49,613
I'm done, little ant.

988
01:11:55,927 --> 01:11:58,623
Run! Run!

989
01:12:00,432 --> 01:12:02,730
Lucas, go on.

990
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:04,994
Save yourself.

991
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:21,419
That's not the way ants are.

992
01:12:24,623 --> 01:12:26,113
Hurry up.

993
01:12:41,473 --> 01:12:43,600
Lucas? Lucas!

994
01:12:47,545 --> 01:12:49,240
Lucas!

995
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,345
You did it. You did it!

996
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:00,585
Now, that's an ant.

997
01:13:00,759 --> 01:13:01,987
Oh, sorry.

998
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:04,724
Thanks, kid.

999
01:13:14,205 --> 01:13:16,139
Oh, yeah!

1000
01:13:17,008 --> 01:13:20,239
-Our weapons are useless.
-We just need a clear shot.

1001
01:13:23,915 --> 01:13:26,850
Hey, wait. A shot.

1002
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:32,079
Okay, now what?

1003
01:13:32,257 --> 01:13:36,250
Well, I don't know,
because I've never attacked before.

1004
01:13:36,428 --> 01:13:38,487
-Isn't that funny?
-Hilarious.

1005
01:13:38,897 --> 01:13:41,525
Oh, look. Here's a way in.

1006
01:13:44,502 --> 01:13:48,404
<i>Enjoy a world that's entirely bug free</i>

1007
01:13:49,107 --> 01:13:52,941
<i>Call Beals-A-Bug</i>
<i>And leave the bug-killing to me</i>

1008
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:03,277
Okay, I'm feeling like we ought to attack
something in here.

1009
01:14:04,289 --> 01:14:06,985
Hey, that looks vulnerable.

1010
01:14:07,158 --> 01:14:09,558
Perfect.

1011
01:14:13,932 --> 01:14:16,730
Oh, look. Here's our way out.

1012
01:14:17,235 --> 01:14:19,965
Let's give this human a goodbye kiss.

1013
01:14:22,607 --> 01:14:24,370
Pucker up, Mr. Beals!

1014
01:14:50,168 --> 01:14:52,762
No, no, no.

1015
01:14:52,937 --> 01:14:55,337
Stop. Just get away from me.
Get away from me.

1016
01:15:02,814 --> 01:15:04,372
You can't exterminate me.

1017
01:15:04,549 --> 01:15:08,007
Oh, yeah. I'm Stan Beals!

1018
01:15:08,186 --> 01:15:09,915
Oh, no, no, no!

1019
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:14,652
Praise the Mother!

1020
01:15:21,032 --> 01:15:23,523
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas!

1021
01:15:31,609 --> 01:15:36,637
This day I no longer see
a human among ants...

1022
01:15:36,815 --> 01:15:40,774
...but instead a single colony.

1023
01:15:40,952 --> 01:15:43,921
No more Lucas the Destroyer...

1024
01:15:44,088 --> 01:15:47,455
...but Rokai the ant.

1025
01:15:50,795 --> 01:15:53,195
Welcome to the colony.

1026
01:15:54,499 --> 01:15:57,593
Isn't that wonderful?

1027
01:15:58,469 --> 01:16:00,767
-Rokai?
-It's an ant name.

1028
01:16:00,939 --> 01:16:02,372
A wizard name.

1029
01:16:02,841 --> 01:16:07,210
Rokai has earned his freedom.

1030
01:16:07,712 --> 01:16:10,909
And we have earned a friend.

1031
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:14,251
Remember us.

1032
01:16:17,488 --> 01:16:18,716
Hey, Lucas--

1033
01:16:19,724 --> 01:16:22,989
I mean, Rokai.
Listen, once you get back...

1034
01:16:23,161 --> 01:16:26,858
...if you get the chance, how about
dropping a few sweet rocks now and then?

1035
01:16:27,031 --> 01:16:30,194
You know, red ones, preferably.

1036
01:16:30,368 --> 01:16:33,599
Red ones?
I thought you hated the red ones.

1037
01:16:33,771 --> 01:16:38,538
Well, I do, but I'm starting to like them.

1038
01:16:39,644 --> 01:16:42,511
I'm gonna miss you, Two Legs.

1039
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:45,478
Calling a human "friend."

1040
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:48,346
I thought that impossible until you came.

1041
01:16:48,519 --> 01:16:51,283
But, Zoc, a wizard knows no such word.

1042
01:16:51,956 --> 01:16:53,685
Very true.

1043
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:55,490
Here.

1044
01:16:56,561 --> 01:16:59,655
But just wait until you're outside
before you drink it.

1045
01:16:59,831 --> 01:17:02,732
I still think I should have eaten you
when I had the chance.

1046
01:17:02,901 --> 01:17:04,698
I am soft and chewy.

1047
01:17:04,869 --> 01:17:07,736
But I promised the queen I wouldn't.

1048
01:17:08,439 --> 01:17:09,929
I'm gonna miss you, Hova.

1049
01:17:10,108 --> 01:17:12,702
We're going to miss you too, Rokai.

1050
01:17:12,877 --> 01:17:14,367
Cross our hearts.

1051
01:17:14,746 --> 01:17:17,374
Cross our hearts!

1052
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:30,219
He's back. He's back!

1053
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:36,561
He's in his birthday suit.
Happy birthday, Lucas!

1054
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:40,166
Got you that time.

1055
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:50,847
Hi, Tiff. Is everything all right?

1056
01:17:51,015 --> 01:17:52,243
Where's Lucas?

1057
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:55,909
Still locked in his room,
hiding from society.

1058
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:57,949
Mom, hey, Mom!

1059
01:17:58,122 --> 01:18:01,751
-Lucas, what is it?
-I forgot to tell you goodbye.

1060
01:18:02,327 --> 01:18:04,261
Goodbye.

1061
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:07,921
Goodbye, Peanut. Oh, sorry,
I shouldn't call you that.

1062
01:18:08,099 --> 01:18:10,761
It's okay. I don't mind.

1063
01:18:11,235 --> 01:18:14,033
<i>Casa</i>, sweet <i>casa</i>.

1064
01:18:14,339 --> 01:18:17,069
These suitcases are <i>muy grande</i>,
my little love nacho.

1065
01:18:17,241 --> 01:18:18,708
How about getting the <i>el</i> door-o?

1066
01:18:18,876 --> 01:18:21,140
I don't know what you mean, honey.

1067
01:18:21,312 --> 01:18:23,872
-Yeah, honey, the <i>puerta</i>, the--
-What's the <i>puerta</i>?

1068
01:18:24,048 --> 01:18:27,313
-The door, the door!
-The door. Okay, I got it. I got it.

1069
01:18:29,387 --> 01:18:33,050
Hey, Pukas, where you been?
We've been looking for you.

1070
01:18:33,224 --> 01:18:38,662
-I think someone's overdue for a dogpile.
-Yeah, dogpile!

1071
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:40,058
He said dogpile.

1072
01:18:40,231 --> 01:18:44,725
Stop saying everything I say, got it?

1073
01:18:44,902 --> 01:18:48,861
Stop saying everything you say. Got it.

1074
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,702
That's it. How about I dogpile you?

1075
01:18:51,876 --> 01:18:55,004
How about you leave him alone?
What the craznocks is wrong with you?

1076
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:58,779
What? How about you make me?

1077
01:18:58,950 --> 01:19:03,444
Oh, that's right, you can't.

1078
01:19:03,621 --> 01:19:07,717
Because I'm big and you're small.

1079
01:19:08,059 --> 01:19:13,656
Yeah, I'm small. We're all small.
But together, we're big.

1080
01:19:13,831 --> 01:19:17,198
You think these stupid losers
are going to team up against me?

1081
01:19:17,368 --> 01:19:21,930
I can do anything I want to them,
and there's nothing they can do about it.

1082
01:19:22,273 --> 01:19:26,073
And the same goes for you, Pukas.

1083
01:19:26,644 --> 01:19:28,612
Dogpile!

1084
01:19:30,448 --> 01:19:34,407
I said, dogpile!

1085
01:19:35,253 --> 01:19:39,781
-You heard the man.
-Dogpile!

1086
01:19:42,026 --> 01:19:46,122
No! Don't hurt me! Mommy!

1087
01:19:47,165 --> 01:19:49,258
Hey, you guys want to come over
and play?

1088
01:19:49,434 --> 01:19:51,732
Yeah, cool. Come on, Lucas.

1089
01:19:51,903 --> 01:19:54,667
I'll catch up.
There's something I gotta do first.

1090
01:19:54,839 --> 01:19:57,672
Yeah! All right!

1091
01:19:57,842 --> 01:19:59,366
Oh, yeah.

1092
01:20:00,845 --> 01:20:03,541
They sure grow up fast.

1093
01:20:04,682 --> 01:20:06,707
-What?
-Look what I got.

1094
01:20:06,884 --> 01:20:08,146
Oh, no. Zoc.

1095
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:12,312
Zoc! Wait! Wait! No, no! Stop!

1096
01:20:12,523 --> 01:20:14,047
Come on.

1097
01:20:14,959 --> 01:20:17,723
Stop it! I'm serious....

1098
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,167
Sweet rocks!
