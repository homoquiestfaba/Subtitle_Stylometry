1
00:00:20,753 --> 00:00:22,188
Stuart, pay attention.

2
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:23,823
To the bush, not the blossom.

3
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:26,159
Allan, I think she might
be coming on to us.

4
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,161
No, no. Don't be silly.

5
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,063
Mrs. Roberts is one of my best clients.

6
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,364
Divorced women have needs.

7
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:33,366
She's not divorced.
There's a trial separation.

8
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,836
Desires, deep-seated sexual...

9
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:40,173
Stuart, you're making this
sound like we're in a porno.

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,242
This is not...

11
00:00:44,376 --> 00:00:45,778
This is not a porno.

12
00:01:00,462 --> 00:01:02,462
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, Mrs. Roberts.

13
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,730
I was wondering if you
could do me a little favor.

14
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:06,819
I had a pink petunia up in my bedroom.

15
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,534
In your bedroom?

16
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:10,369
And it could really use some attention.

17
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:12,839
That's funny because petunias
are usually outdoor plants.

18
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:15,261
It hasn't been watered
for a very long time.

19
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,243
A very long time.

20
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,093
Allan.

21
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:35,128
Are you coming?

22
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:39,532
Allan, you need to come right now.

23
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,270
- Welcome.
- Oh.

24
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,806
- He-he-he, nice.
- To my humble abode.

25
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:49,175
Oh, here's my petunia, so...

26
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:52,645
It's so lonely and dry.

27
00:01:52,678 --> 00:01:54,567
It just needs a little bit of love.

28
00:01:55,514 --> 00:01:56,916
- Oh.
- God, look at you.

29
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:58,151
Oh, fuck.

30
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,153
Umm.

31
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,255
I'm just gonna get out of my wet clothes.

32
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,491
- Okay.
- So you two could just relax.

33
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:07,794
And, you know, be comfortable.

34
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,397
You know what, Stuart, this thing is dying.

35
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,933
I need to get home right now.
I'm too busy...

36
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:16,269
- What are you doing?
- She said to get comfortable.

37
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,304
No, no, Stuart, I mean,
sit down on the couch.

38
00:02:18,337 --> 00:02:20,373
That doesn't mean take your clothes off,
please.

39
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:22,808
Allan, it's happening.
We're gonna lose our virginity.

40
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:24,210
- What?
- Oh, man.

41
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:26,479
No, no, no, that is unseemly, it is sordid.

42
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:28,181
- It's ridiculous.
- What are you talking about?

43
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,815
- It's none of those things
- Please.

44
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:32,185
Losing your virginity is
suppose to be special.

45
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,319
What could be more special

46
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:34,752
than a three-way with Mrs. Roberts?

47
00:02:34,753 --> 00:02:36,622
All right, tomorrow
morning we'll be legends

48
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:38,257
of Tupper High School.

49
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,894
You're right, you're right. Oh...

50
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,929
Safe word. We need a safe word now.

51
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,197
Why? What?

52
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:45,965
Our safe word could be petunia.

53
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:47,600
So if one of us feels uncomfortable

54
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:48,768
with this whole situation,

55
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,204
we could just say the word,
and we'll be out of here.

56
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,237
No, we're not. Believe me.

57
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,907
Allan, we got to stay and,
you know, do this.

58
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,709
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

59
00:02:56,742 --> 00:02:58,678
I can't. I need to leave right now, please.

60
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,680
Stuart, no, no, I wanna go.
And don't make me...

61
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,448
Don't make me please. Don't make me.

62
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:04,717
You can do this, buddy.
Just try and think about sex.

63
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,553
I'm a 17 year old virgin.
All I can think about is sex.

64
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:09,589
Allan, look at me. Look at me.

65
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,691
This is not helping because your business

66
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,793
is very, very, very close to me right now.

67
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,594
Well, just close your eyes, man.

68
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:16,996
Close them.

69
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:18,664
Trust me. Close your eyes.

70
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:21,475
And think about the hottest
thing you've ever seen.

71
00:03:24,603 --> 00:03:26,806
- The Lane twins.
- Oh, yeah.

72
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,674
That's a good one. Just walk me through it.

73
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:31,510
<i>Monica and Madeline Lane
burst through the gym doors</i>

74
00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:33,488
<i>and start to stretching the hallway.</i>

75
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:36,249
<i>The pert nipples and swelling breasts</i>

76
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,785
<i>starting to break free
from their tank tops.</i>

77
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:41,587
<i>Legs spread,</i>

78
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,888
<i>asses hugging the floors.</i>

79
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:46,292
<i>They help each other further
and further into their split.</i>

80
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,662
<i>Hair down, eyes begging.</i>

81
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:52,698
<i>Just to be next, and for a moment,</i>

82
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:54,567
<i>just to touch those bodies.</i>

83
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:58,671
<i>I've never wanted to have sex
with those two girls so bad</i>

84
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:00,640
<i>in my entire life.</i>

85
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:02,508
Ready, boys?

86
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:05,044
- Ha, ha.
- Petunia.

87
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:06,646
Petunia, I could be distrac...

88
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,957
- I'm sorry.
- How are you supposed to...?

89
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:10,816
Oh, well.

90
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:11,884
Just you and me.

91
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,917
<i>You have reached Stuart Diller.</i>

92
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,387
<i>Leave a message after the beep. Thank you.</i>

93
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,422
Hey, it's me.

94
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,291
Again.

95
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,052
Just do me a call back
when you got a chance.

96
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:55,061
Thanks.

97
00:04:59,378 --> 00:05:01,767
Allan, I know you and
Stuart are having sex.

98
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,469
Mom, I'm a little busy with...

99
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:05,404
Wait. What?

100
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:07,326
You know, not together. Separately.

101
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:09,951
- How would you even...?
- Facebook.

102
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:12,778
- Why are you on my Facebook?
- I'm not stalking you.

103
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:14,613
Let me get this conversation, Allan.

104
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:16,582
I should have had it
with you a long time ago.

105
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:18,417
I'm not having this conversation with you.

106
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,554
I know about the sex thing,
and I know about hook-ups,

107
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:22,488
and rainbow parties.

108
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,590
I think they over-exaggerate that stuff.

109
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:26,826
The pole picnics,
and the trombone tournaments,

110
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,060
and the frilling and jilling.

111
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:29,962
I have actually no idea what that is.

112
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:33,399
Okay, look,
I'd rather you say nothing than lie to me.

113
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:37,837
Oh, my God. Mom.

114
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,672
I got you mediums.

115
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:40,940
But if they're too big,

116
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,975
we can return any unopened package,

117
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,043
because I already asked them.

118
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:46,679
They said to keep the receipt,
just try them on.

119
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,048
To see, you know,
what feels good, what fits.

120
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:51,784
And, uh, some of them are flavored.

121
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,886
Glad we had the talk.

122
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:09,135
What?

123
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,778
<i>Hey, it's the Stu-man.</i>

124
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,479
<i>How about get me?</i>

125
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:21,914
Um, hi.

126
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,683
You have a new greeting.

127
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:27,553
It's interesting.

128
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,988
Eh...

129
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,524
Can you just please call me
back whenever you get a chance?

130
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,558
Okay, thanks.

131
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:47,940
But parents are still
going away this week right?

132
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,442
Yeah.

133
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,743
We're still gonna party, right?

134
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:51,977
Oh, we're still gonna party.

135
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,547
Ha, ha. But not with you two.

136
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,815
Hey.

137
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,616
What's this stuff called again?

138
00:06:57,649 --> 00:06:58,951
Bangkok bliss.

139
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:01,487
Oh, well, I mean, we
could score that, so...

140
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,688
- Oh.
- Yeah.

141
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:05,721
You guys couldn't score gin
from your parents' cabinet.

142
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:08,628
Yeah.

143
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,096
But I paid full-price.

144
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:14,533
Stuart. Hey, Stuart.

145
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:16,669
- How are you doing?
- How do you think it went?

146
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,938
I hit that ass. Hard.

147
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:21,774
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

148
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:23,709
The lady is a serious freak.

149
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:26,245
She's talking about a
three-way this weekend.

150
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,614
That's okay, I'm fine. I don't wanna go to.

151
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:30,616
Not with you. With her friend, Danielle.

152
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:32,017
- Oh, great.
- Yeah, not with you.

153
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,786
- Of course, no, no.
- Yeah.

154
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,621
Hey, um...

155
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:39,788
Would you mind not telling
anybody what happened to me?

156
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:46,999
Petunia.

157
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:00,246
Hey, what did we say about parking

158
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,282
that pussy-pink-piece-
of-shit car over here?

159
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:05,885
Seriously,
who in the fuck drives a pink Volvo?

160
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,087
Actually, it's salmon, but it's fine.

161
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,565
I'll move it. Don't worry.

162
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,790
I'm sorry. What did you just say?

163
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:14,026
It's pink. It's definitely pink.

164
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:15,061
Good boy.

165
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,431
You have a little trouble sticking it in,
huh?

166
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:23,202
Come on, petunia. Move it.

167
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,556
Good morning, ladies.

168
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:48,260
If those tops were any tighter,

169
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:50,162
I could see what you had for breakfast.

170
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:53,098
Oh, thank you, Mr. Horton.

171
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:55,965
It wasn't a compliment.
Please check the dress code.

172
00:08:58,036 --> 00:08:59,038
<i>Okay.</i>

173
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:05,109
Stay true. Stay cool.

174
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:08,648
Abstinence weekend. It's gonna be really...

175
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:10,883
- Hi, Allan.
- Hey, Brittany.

176
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,118
I didn't realized that you're in Stay True,
Stay Cool.

177
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:14,386
Yeah, I'm sort of trying it out.

178
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:17,122
We're getting sign-ups for Tour
of Depravity Camping Retreat.

179
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:19,758
Tomorrow after school and
there's still spots on the bus.

180
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,227
FYI, no agendas.

181
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,929
Mr. Horton is probably not even joining.

182
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:25,197
FYI.

183
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,935
- Agendas?
- He means gay agendas.

184
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:32,938
Oh, well, FYI, I'm not gay.

185
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:35,007
Oh, no. Ignore him. It's
cool if you're gay.

186
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,911
No, uh...
It's absolutely cool to be gay, if you are,

187
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:40,212
but I'm not at all.

188
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,016
So, um, everyone's welcome and it's free.

189
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:46,161
- Are you interested at all...?
- Yeah.

190
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:49,221
Yeah, I'll definitely consider it.

191
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:51,891
Is it true about Stuart Diller?

192
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:53,392
Yeah.

193
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:56,128
Because Mrs. Roberts is like really old.

194
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:57,796
Boys could be so gross about that.

195
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:59,999
Yes,
I completely agree with you 100 percent.

196
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,101
Most boys are really gross.

197
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,702
You know, it must be very difficult

198
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:05,537
to be a girl in todays cultural climate.

199
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:07,137
Because whether or not you had sex,

200
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,240
you'd be completely...

201
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:09,275
Petunia.

202
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,881
- Irrelevant?
- Yeah.

203
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:08,701
Come on. Yah!

204
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:49,007
So we have new renters across the street.

205
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,043
- They seem really nice.
- Mm.

206
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:52,911
They have a son like your age, Zack.

207
00:11:52,944 --> 00:11:54,179
He's gonna go to your school,

208
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:56,115
so I mentioned that you could drive home.

209
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,083
What? No.

210
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,084
Why did you do that? I don't know the guy.

211
00:11:59,117 --> 00:12:00,953
It's a neighborly thing to do, honey.

212
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,153
He seems really nice.

213
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:04,090
Aah...

214
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:07,192
- Are you riding dusty?
- What?

215
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:08,927
Riding dusty. Huffing canned air.

216
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,230
No, Mom. No, I'm not huffing canned air.

217
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,998
Honey, it is horribly addictive.

218
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:14,767
People's lives are ruined.

219
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,502
Mom, I am not huffing canned air.

220
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,271
I'm not having sex. I
am not doing anything.

221
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:21,841
So, please. Just leave me alone.

222
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:25,177
So touchy.

223
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:35,855
- Who is it?
- Allan.

224
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,857
- What?
- Um, my name is Allan.

225
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,393
I'm here to give Zack a ride to school.

226
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:42,428
Oh, fuck.

227
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:46,499
What's up, man?

228
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:49,802
Where's your ride at?

229
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:55,007
Oh,
I can't believe you drive a fucking vulva.

230
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,843
I can't believe your front
door is an effing couch.

231
00:12:57,876 --> 00:13:00,279
Oh, touche, motherfucker.

232
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,201
That bitch is stuck.
Thanks for the ride, by the way.

233
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,385
We should you wax your Volvo, right?

234
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,886
What?

235
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,988
You know how women wax their vaginas?

236
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:12,541
Look, if you don't like Volvos,
you don't have to drive with me.

237
00:13:12,557 --> 00:13:14,593
Relax, bro. I'm just kidding.

238
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:16,128
I love your Volvo.

239
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:18,931
You know what I don't like,
is a hairy vulva.

240
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,433
There was just one time, dude,
I was eating this chick out,

241
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:23,168
and literally, she got all these pubes

242
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:24,937
just stuck in my teeth, and...

243
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,839
And it's look like my teeth had a beard.

244
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:27,973
Oh, what did you do?

245
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:30,209
I freaked the furry fandango all night.

246
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,411
Wait. Pubic hair stuck in your teeth?

247
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,580
Yeah, man.
I'm pretty sexually active for my age.

248
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,381
You know? I deal with a lot of chicks.

249
00:13:36,414 --> 00:13:38,483
- Uh-huh.
- Speaking of...

250
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:40,986
Your mom is super hot.

251
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,156
Is there like father
figure around or anything?

252
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:45,891
Um, no, there's not.

253
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:47,604
Well, I'm probably gonna have to tap that.

254
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,361
Excuse me, I don't appreciate you

255
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:51,029
talking about my mother like that.

256
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:53,131
Yeah. I'll just dial it back.

257
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:54,200
Okay. Good.

258
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,635
Shit's my stuff, my man.

259
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:59,338
My dad's in prison.
They moved him over to Wainwright.

260
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,506
That's why we came here, so...

261
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:03,475
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

262
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:05,397
He's actually kind of a big player.

263
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,313
We're, uh...
We're sort of in witness protection.

264
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:10,182
I don't think you're suppose to tell people

265
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:11,950
you're in the witness protection program

266
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:13,919
if you're in the witness
protection program.

267
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:15,254
No, I mean, and for sure not,

268
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,422
but I figured we're gonna be friends, so...

269
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:19,925
Might as well, let you
in on my life, right?

270
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,193
Yeah, I guess.

271
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:22,628
So I got the hook up through him.

272
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,163
If you ever need anything,
I can get it for you.

273
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:27,499
Drugs, guns, whatever.

274
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:29,088
You can do that from prison?

275
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,170
- Dude, absolutely.
- Huh.

276
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:37,630
Would you not slam the door?

277
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,082
- Would you mind?
- What's up?

278
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:45,555
Replacement dashboards for this model

279
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,253
are very hard to come by.

280
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:50,522
- You're kidding, right?
- No, I'm not.

281
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:54,159
Oh, you're funny, dude. I like you.

282
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:55,394
You're good.

283
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,197
We're running late. Seat belt, please.

284
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,632
Ooh.

285
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:01,567
One of those guys.

286
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:03,967
Locked and loaded, brother.

287
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:07,625
What are you doing? We're
gonna be late, go.

288
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:16,448
You know what you have to do
on your first day in prison?

289
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:18,984
No. I have no idea.

290
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:20,118
Go out in the yard.

291
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,222
You find the biggest,
meanest motherfucker there is.

292
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:24,656
Bam!

293
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,292
Cold-cock that motherfucker
right in the face.

294
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:29,027
Sends them a message.

295
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,696
That's actually how I like to roll

296
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,464
on my first day in the new school,

297
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:34,967
except with the hottest chicks,
you know what I'm saying?

298
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,568
- You hit a girl?
- What?

299
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:37,703
How did you...? No.

300
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,304
No, I don't hit her.

301
00:15:39,337 --> 00:15:41,782
I hit on her.
I would never hit a chick, bro.

302
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:44,042
Oh, right. Totally.

303
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:45,675
So who's the hottest chick in this place?

304
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,312
Probably have to be the Lane twins.

305
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:49,147
- You have twins?
- Mm-hm.

306
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,550
Are you messing with me right now?
Because that's not funny.

307
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,319
- No, they're identical.
- And they're hot?

308
00:15:53,518 --> 00:15:55,287
Yeah. I could say they're pretty hot.

309
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,256
Amazingly and incredibly hot.

310
00:15:57,622 --> 00:16:00,058
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

311
00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:01,460
- Have you fucked them yet?
- What?

312
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,595
- Have you fucked?
- No, I never talked to them.

313
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:06,598
I don't think I can ever
sustain eye contact with them.

314
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:07,633
Do they fuck?

315
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,123
The general consensus is that
they're sexually adventurous.

316
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,139
Dude, we have to fuck them.

317
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:19,044
That strikes me as highly,
highly improbable.

318
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:21,079
Where is the faith, bro?

319
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:22,514
At least, fake it till you make it.

320
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:24,436
That's half the battle right there.

321
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,585
Oh, hey, petunia.

322
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:29,187
What did we tell you about
parking this shit here?

323
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:32,324
- What the hell is this?
- Don't worry, it's fine.

324
00:16:32,357 --> 00:16:33,359
Move it.

325
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,194
We see you have a new fuck buddy over here.

326
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:38,163
What the fuck did you call me?

327
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:41,266
It smells like pussy over there, dude.

328
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:43,468
It smells real strong pussy.
You coming around, bro?

329
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:44,636
Are you coming around?

330
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:47,272
Dude, I'm gonna fuck you so hard in the ass

331
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:49,475
that the tip of my dick
knocks out your front teeth,

332
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:52,544
and I'm gonna rock your dicks
like Chinese finger traps.

333
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:54,446
- Suck it.
- Oh, my God.

334
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:56,782
Oh, my God. This is bad.

335
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,217
- This is really really bad.
- Douchebags, dude.

336
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,753
- They probably wanna kill us.
- Those guys?

337
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:04,689
Dude, I got your back.
Those guys are done and done.

338
00:17:04,722 --> 00:17:06,391
I'm gonna have to be homeschooled now.

339
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:07,826
You are a fantastic driver.

340
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,461
You'll make a good wheelman someday.

341
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:10,562
What?

342
00:17:10,595 --> 00:17:12,731
The guy that drives the
getaway car in the robbery.

343
00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:14,766
Look, I just need you to stop talking.

344
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,668
- Why?
- Because...

345
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:17,701
Before we could continue,

346
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:19,805
there's a couple of
things you need to know.

347
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,139
But... Like what?

348
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:22,707
Those guys that you just threatened

349
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,076
to sodomize back there,

350
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,387
they're very dangerous.

351
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:29,381
Last year,
they gave Sheldon Taylor a wedgie.

352
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:31,650
The doctors still have not
found his left testicle.

353
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,152
He's had three MRI's and a colonoscopy,

354
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:35,086
it is very, very serious.

355
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,355
All right, buddy, you need to relax, okay?

356
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:40,092
I got your back.
I told you, I'll take care of those guys.

357
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,459
Would you just trust me?

358
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,361
Okay, well, assuming that's true,

359
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,098
that doesn't change the fact
that I'm the biggest loser-nerd

360
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,332
in this entire high school.

361
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,335
And not even my best friend
Stuart wants to be seen with me.

362
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:51,370
Why is that?

363
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:53,539
He had sex.

364
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:58,477
And I guess that makes me not
cool enough to be his friend.

365
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,612
He ditched you because he got laid?

366
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,447
Yeah, basically.

367
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,925
Then he's not your friend.

368
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,152
Real friends help each other out, man.

369
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,387
They stick together through whatever.

370
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,591
Easy to say but being seen
with me goes against that.

371
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,460
All right,
what it was is not what it would be.

372
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:17,762
Just because you're the
biggest loser-nerd today

373
00:18:17,795 --> 00:18:19,764
does not mean you're
gonna be that tomorrow.

374
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:21,299
Okay, shit changes.

375
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:23,268
- Really?
- Absolutely, man.

376
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,537
Let's go fuck this shit up.

377
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,391
Oh, a little late for that, sweetheart.

378
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,252
- Hey, Allan.
- Hey, Brittany.

379
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:42,621
- Is he with you?
- No, not really.

380
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:47,359
So, um, I decided that I wanna
sign up for the camping trip.

381
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,493
Great. Um...

382
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,896
Just make sure you get it
signed by a parent or guardian.

383
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,131
Will do.

384
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,366
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah.

385
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,607
I just wanted to say that,

386
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,904
I think it was really cool
what you said yesterday

387
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,772
about being a girl in our cultural climate.

388
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:03,083
It felt really good to hear guys say that.

389
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:07,513
- Well, you know, I just...
- Can I get your number?

390
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:10,882
For the membership.

391
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:12,751
You have to be a member to go camping.

392
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,453
Great, great. Um...

393
00:19:15,065 --> 00:19:16,621
I just found the Lane twins,

394
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:18,256
they're even better than you said.

395
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:20,259
They're hot as balls. Come on.

396
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:22,661
Um...

397
00:19:24,085 --> 00:19:25,697
- Brittany?
- Yes, Mr. Horton.

398
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,953
- Did he say hot balls?
- I think he did.

399
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,343
Dude, they are so hot.

400
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,780
I don't think I've ever been
this close to them before.

401
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,848
You know what, fuck it.

402
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:45,817
I'm gonna go introduce myself.
Are you coming?

403
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,386
No, no, I don't think you're
supposed to talk to them.

404
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,555
- Actually, I'm positive now...
- Yeah, you're coming.

405
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:51,723
No. You don't understand.

406
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:53,658
I can't. I can't...

407
00:19:53,691 --> 00:19:57,896
Ladies, hello.
I'm Zack at your service, uh...

408
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,531
New guy. First day.

409
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:01,800
- You know my friend, right?
- No, they don't...

410
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,802
Listen, I'm imagining you probably

411
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,904
wanna know a little bit about myself.

412
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:09,007
Uh, other than being hung like a horse,

413
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,009
my father is in prison.

414
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:13,545
He's actually this big player
in the criminal underground,

415
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:16,748
so if you ever need anything,
anything at all,

416
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:18,283
we can get the hook up for you.

417
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:19,384
We can get the hook up?

418
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:23,622
You know, even guns, drugs,
your boyfriends whacked.

419
00:20:24,046 --> 00:20:26,491
Not like whacked off.
Like, you know, killed.

420
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:27,626
It's a mob term.

421
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,595
- It's really not a big deal.
- Wow.

422
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:33,431
Wow, I thought that went extremely well.

423
00:20:33,464 --> 00:20:35,500
You're gonna have to
get a restraining order.

424
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:37,402
It's your raw animal attraction.

425
00:20:37,435 --> 00:20:39,905
Early days, motherfucker. Early days.

426
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:44,943
Hey, at least I tried,

427
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:46,645
which is more than some of us can say.

428
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,380
Look, I was joking, okay?

429
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,548
- I thought that you...
- There's that little bitch.

430
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:52,317
- Oh, my God.
- What are you doing?

431
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,585
- Stop.
- Go, go, go.

432
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:55,387
Relax. Relax yourself.

433
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,989
- Dude.
- Shh, those guys...

434
00:20:58,022 --> 00:20:59,691
- What?
- Oh, my bad.

435
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:01,593
Hope we're not interrupting
a blow job here.

436
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:03,395
Oh, no, no, no, you guys are all good.

437
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,363
We're waiting for you to start sucking.

438
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:07,032
What's up, bitch? What's up, bitch?

439
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,534
You wanna fucking do this, bro?
You wanna get real?

440
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:12,537
This is real life. This is fucking real.

441
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,739
I'm gonna fuck all of them in your face,
bitch.

442
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:15,940
Oh...

443
00:21:15,973 --> 00:21:17,909
We'll go to hell together, motherfucker.

444
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:18,944
Motherfucker...

445
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:22,447
Let's do it. Make your way.

446
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,915
I'm gonna take a metal rod,

447
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:26,718
and repeatedly shove it up
your ass until you bleed.

448
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:28,520
And I'm gonna drink the blood and spit it

449
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,622
in your mother's mouth
while I fuck your siblings.

450
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:32,989
How do you feel about that, bro? Fucking...

451
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,861
- Oh, what's this?
- Come on, let's do it.

452
00:21:36,894 --> 00:21:38,496
Fuck this shit. Look, the guy's...

453
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:40,932
- Fucking problems, man.
- You're crazy, motherfucker.

454
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:44,569
Oh, yeah? Who's crazy, motherfucker?

455
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:46,805
Bitches.

456
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:49,574
Whoa.

457
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:52,377
Oh, my God, that has to
be the coolest thing

458
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,778
I've ever seen in my entire life.

459
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:56,348
What did I tell you, man. I got your back.

460
00:21:58,049 --> 00:21:59,117
Okay.

461
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,855
And she was like this,
and she's going up, up, up.

462
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:05,857
I didn't even know how I reached that,
you know.

463
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,625
- But it usually like...
- Off the table.

464
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:08,893
Sorry, Mr. Jones.

465
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:14,933
We're all friends here.

466
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,935
We could be more than friends if you want.

467
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,070
Am I right? Okay.

468
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:25,877
Hey, ladies.

469
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,012
I think we've got a line on some weed.

470
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:29,647
That's really impressive, Kenny.

471
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,416
Yeah, maybe I should just tweet about it

472
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:32,984
because it's just too exciting.

473
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:36,129
We're also looking in to
getting you that Bangalore shit.

474
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,513
Don't worry about it.
I think we got that covered.

475
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,762
I'm sure you probably don't care,

476
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,697
but you're not supposed
to have food in here.

477
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,899
Oh, you're right. I don't care.

478
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:51,103
- Zack, right?
- Ladies.

479
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,004
At your service, please.

480
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:54,426
Come around. Take a seat.

481
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,076
You, uh, you remember my man, Allan, right?

482
00:22:58,109 --> 00:22:59,577
Oh, did you just move here too?

483
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,050
Oh, no, we've gone to school since...

484
00:23:01,078 --> 00:23:02,547
Do you have the connect or...?

485
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,048
No, I can get you whatever you want.

486
00:23:04,081 --> 00:23:05,750
Great, because our friend, Amber...

487
00:23:05,783 --> 00:23:06,985
Yes, Amber, I remember Amber.

488
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,087
They called her easy-bake Amber.
It was terrible.

489
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,755
She was in Bangkok last year,

490
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:14,025
and she did this amazing club
drug called Bangkok bliss.

491
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:15,994
None of the lame asses
at school can score it.

492
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,530
Bangkok, capital of Thailand.

493
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,883
Actually, formerly known as Siam,

494
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:22,567
which where they came up
the term Siamese cats.

495
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:24,803
- You done?
- Yeah.

496
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,172
Bangkok bliss. All over that shit.

497
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,706
- You've done it?
- Yeah.

498
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:30,608
Several times actually.
It's really awesome.

499
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:32,477
- What's it like?
- It's smooth.

500
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:35,313
- Can you get some?
- Yeah, as much as you want.

501
00:23:35,513 --> 00:23:36,881
Well, how soon can you get it?

502
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:38,883
Because our parents are
going away this weekend

503
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:41,119
and we thought that we might, you know,

504
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:42,687
have a party or something.

505
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,890
It's, it's...
Actually, it's more transcendent drug.

506
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:47,525
You know what I'm...

507
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:49,594
Allan, nope, we got it covered.
It's awesome.

508
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:51,095
I can get it to you by tonight.

509
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:52,864
Great. Well, here's 80.

510
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,966
- Is that enough?
- Yeah, that's fine.

511
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:56,568
Allan and I will roll over tonight.

512
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,770
After we get the shit,
we'll just take it from there.

513
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,638
Yeah, we should exchange numbers.

514
00:24:00,671 --> 00:24:01,773
- Oh...
- Some digits.

515
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:03,175
- Yes.
- Simplify it up.

516
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,143
- Okay, sure, yeah, so...
- Cool.

517
00:24:05,176 --> 00:24:06,978
Now, she's giving him her number.

518
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:10,014
- What's up with this guy?
- I don't know, man.

519
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:11,549
It's completely messed up, man.

520
00:24:11,582 --> 00:24:12,917
It's fucking messed up.

521
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,686
Here, just call when you get those.

522
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,553
Oh, absolutely. That sounds great.

523
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:18,523
Awesome.

524
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:21,059
Dude, we are gonna fuck
the Lane twins, bro.

525
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,662
Oh, no. No, no, no.

526
00:24:24,695 --> 00:24:28,633
I heard absolutely nothing
about sexual intercourse.

527
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,738
Oh, no, no, no, man. It's PNP, baby.

528
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:36,074
- PNP
- P and what?

529
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,542
Party and play, dude.

530
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,246
<i>Fucky, fucky all weekend long</i>

531
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,616
<i>It's orgy time</i>

532
00:24:45,983 --> 00:24:47,151
Oh, my God.

533
00:24:47,184 --> 00:24:49,018
I just hope we can find this shit.

534
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,089
I thought you said you got a connect.

535
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,524
What? Bangkok bliss?

536
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,825
No, I've never heard of it.

537
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:56,194
Well, obviously you're not
gonna get Bangkok bliss.

538
00:24:56,227 --> 00:24:58,096
Google it, yeah, Google it.

539
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,865
- Internet search it.
- Which one should I do Allan?

540
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:03,768
- Both.
- I am not going to Google it.

541
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:05,913
All right, dude? I'm gonna call my dad.

542
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:11,609
Okay, okay, wait.
Can you just wait up a second?

543
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:13,578
Do you really think you
should be calling him?

544
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:15,013
Don't they monitor stuff like this?

545
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,681
No, dude, I'm not calling the prison.

546
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:18,583
- I'm calling his cell.
- His cell phone?

547
00:25:18,616 --> 00:25:20,818
Yeah, dude, they suitcased them in.

548
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:22,820
- Suitcased them?
- Yeah, up their ass.

549
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:24,756
You know what I'm saying?
Prison is no joke.

550
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:25,990
How do they get them out?

551
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:28,326
Huh, dude, you do not wanna know.

552
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,228
Hey. Yup, no, it's me.

553
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:31,817
I wanted to talk real quick.

554
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,844
So I think that tonight
is not gonna work for me.

555
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:47,344
What?

556
00:25:47,378 --> 00:25:50,415
Obviously, I'm not going to
the Stay True Stay Cool trip.

557
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,283
Are you out of your fucking mind, dude?

558
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:55,119
The Lane twins are
practically licking our dicks.

559
00:25:55,152 --> 00:25:57,288
You wanna go kumbaya
with a bunch of virgins?

560
00:25:57,321 --> 00:25:59,991
I have to tell you the
truth about something.

561
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:02,928
I'm a virgin.

562
00:26:04,228 --> 00:26:06,631
There. I said it.

563
00:26:06,664 --> 00:26:08,132
- Like an anal sex virgin?
- No.

564
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:10,602
No, an any sex virgin.

565
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:14,339
- You lucky son of a bitch.
- What?

566
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,608
- Why?
- You get to lose it to twins.

567
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,309
That's never happened before.

568
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:20,676
You're like the Lance Armstrong of virgins.

569
00:26:20,876 --> 00:26:23,181
What does Lance Armstrong
have anything to do with this?

570
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,983
Is this because he has testicular cancer?

571
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:25,984
What?

572
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,652
I don't understand what
you're talking about.

573
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:29,205
Lance Armstrong, first guy on the moon.

574
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,355
Lance Armstrong wasn't
the first guy on the moon.

575
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,856
- He was the first guy.
- No.

576
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:33,658
- Yes, he was.
- No.

577
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:34,892
Allan, stop.

578
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,296
Twenty years from now,
when you're all old and messed up,

579
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:40,098
you're gonna completely look back on this

580
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:42,233
and regret missing this opportunity.

581
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:43,268
Guaranteed.

582
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,236
Ladies.

583
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,405
We still up for tonight, boys?

584
00:26:47,438 --> 00:26:49,407
Oh, it is happening as we speak, yeah.

585
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,275
Cool, well, see you tonight, Zack.

586
00:26:51,308 --> 00:26:52,644
Tonight, it is.

587
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,879
- Bye, Alvin.
- It's Allan.

588
00:26:54,912 --> 00:26:58,282
Look, buddy, are you seriously
gonna pass up the fuck rocket

589
00:26:58,315 --> 00:27:00,251
to tuna town for the bus of Virginville?

590
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:01,386
What if I can't perform?

591
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,688
Unh. Come on, man.

592
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:06,090
You basically just skizzed
all over them right now.

593
00:27:06,123 --> 00:27:07,392
Imagine what it's gonna be like

594
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:08,993
when they're all lying there naked

595
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:11,693
with their vaginas just
breathing into your face.

596
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:19,804
Allan.

597
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,275
Allan.

598
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,313
I'll do it.

599
00:27:29,346 --> 00:27:30,882
My man! Give it to me.

600
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,417
There you go.

601
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,119
You know, actually,
we probably should go with the virgin guy.

602
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:36,954
I'm feeling that right now. Let's do that.

603
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:38,423
- Seriously?
- No.

604
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:40,925
Not seriously,
but that's what we're gonna tell our moms.

605
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:44,403
In that way, we have the whole
weekend to spend with the twins.

606
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,264
What's up, bootylicious?

607
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,746
Hey, Allan. You're gonna help us decorate?

608
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:03,748
Actually,
I'm just here to get Zack to sign up.

609
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:04,916
Hey, Zack.

610
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:08,253
So, what, um...?
Where do I sign up for this bad boy?

611
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,676
I'll need a signature from
a parent or a guardian.

612
00:28:11,876 --> 00:28:13,224
- Just right there.
- Right here?

613
00:28:13,257 --> 00:28:14,259
Awesome.

614
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,227
You should lose the sweater, by the way.

615
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,730
You got a great set of
polka dots on your shirt.

616
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,499
I didn't need to know that. Thank you.

617
00:28:21,532 --> 00:28:23,367
I'm really looking forward to this weekend.

618
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,704
Yeah, me too. Should be fun, ha, ha.

619
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,272
- Bye.
- Bye.

620
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,508
Dude, this is brilliant.

621
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:33,177
What Mom doesn't wanna hear
that their son's a virgin?

622
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,433
You don't know my mom.

623
00:28:37,428 --> 00:28:39,817
The rest of the class
aren't taking the bus.

624
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:42,795
And I thought that Zack
and I would take the Volvo.

625
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,157
Mom, Mom, it's okay.
It's just for the weekend.

626
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,635
- I'm gonna be back.
- You're still a virgin.

627
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:50,428
My baby is still a virgin.

628
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,964
- Okay, okay, that's enough.
- Wait, wait, wait.

629
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,799
You don't feel like you're a woman trapped

630
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:56,033
inside a man's body, do you?

631
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:57,401
What? No, no.

632
00:28:57,434 --> 00:28:59,837
It's tragic what can
happen to these people.

633
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,239
Their lives can be ruined.

634
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,207
I want you to understand that I would,
honey.

635
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,341
You can share anything with me.

636
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:08,312
Mom, no, I'm not asking for
sex reassignment surgery.

637
00:29:08,345 --> 00:29:10,381
I'm just asking for you
to sign a permission slip

638
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:11,883
for me to go on a camping trip.

639
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,417
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

640
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,506
- Because you would make...
- Come in.

641
00:29:16,587 --> 00:29:20,324
- Hey.
- Hi, Zachary.

642
00:29:20,357 --> 00:29:22,960
- How are you, darling? Ha, ha.
- Lisa.

643
00:29:22,993 --> 00:29:24,962
You know what, I'm so happy you and my son

644
00:29:24,995 --> 00:29:26,030
have become such good friends.

645
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:30,501
You know,
you have raised one hell of a son, so...

646
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:31,735
Okay, it is time to go.

647
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:34,472
- That's really nice of you.
- Yeah, but first, we got a...

648
00:29:34,505 --> 00:29:36,374
There was a thing that
you're gonna show me.

649
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:37,375
What?

650
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,477
The thing in your room
that you wanna show me.

651
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,246
Uh, yeah, right.
The thing, the thing in my room.

652
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:44,382
Yeah, we gotta get a thing in the room.

653
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,917
Gotta get that thing in the room.

654
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,173
- Okay, help him pack.
- All right, okay.

655
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,355
Thermals and hunting socks, honey.

656
00:29:51,388 --> 00:29:52,824
All right, brother.

657
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:56,261
Come take a seat.

658
00:29:57,995 --> 00:30:00,364
Let's discuss. Okay.

659
00:30:00,397 --> 00:30:01,966
From my years of experience,

660
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:04,235
90 percent of getting with hot chicks

661
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:05,970
is preparing to get with hot chicks.

662
00:30:06,003 --> 00:30:08,172
- Are you with me?
- Yeah, yeah, I think so.

663
00:30:08,205 --> 00:30:10,428
All right. Let's see what you're packing.

664
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:14,312
I don't think I feel entirely comfortable

665
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,446
showing you my penis.

666
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:17,915
Oh, bro, nope. That's not...

667
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:20,017
No, I'm talking about your knapsack.
What's...?

668
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,452
- What's in your knapsack?
- Well...

669
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:22,954
Uh, yeah, sorry.

670
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,490
It's a literal, literal packing.

671
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:31,362
I'm pretty sure they'll
probably have tissue.

672
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:33,631
Yeah, but they're probably
made from old growth forests.

673
00:30:33,664 --> 00:30:35,533
These are 100 percent post consumer.

674
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:38,302
If it's all the same to you,
I'd rather this night not contribute

675
00:30:38,335 --> 00:30:39,336
to the Earth's destruction.

676
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,240
Yeah, for sure, man.
Whatever raises your flag.

677
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,507
Let's go. What else you got?

678
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,611
Um,
I thought we could use some healthy snacks,

679
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,179
so I brought dried mango.

680
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:51,216
What else?

681
00:30:52,316 --> 00:30:55,119
Uh, nasal strips.

682
00:30:55,152 --> 00:30:56,592
I'm pretty sure I don't snore but...

683
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,389
Oh, Allan, Allan, Allan,

684
00:30:58,422 --> 00:31:01,893
you are woefully unprepared
for what lies ahead.

685
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:05,129
Oh, oh,
and I suppose that you are very prepared?

686
00:31:05,162 --> 00:31:06,664
Uh, yeah, I am. Watch out.

687
00:31:06,697 --> 00:31:08,399
Move. Move, move, move.

688
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:09,567
Check this out, bro.

689
00:31:12,002 --> 00:31:13,371
Chocolate pudding.

690
00:31:14,071 --> 00:31:15,960
We got some more chocolate pudding.

691
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:19,176
We got some condos, right?

692
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:20,478
Mr. Lube.

693
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,147
I got some whipped cream.

694
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,549
A little Cheesy McSleazy, bro.

695
00:31:25,582 --> 00:31:28,019
Okay, okay, cheese? Are you serious?

696
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,287
Yes. Seriously.

697
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:33,024
- No, no. What is that for?
- Butter wrestling.

698
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,959
Look,
I think you're taking this way too far.

699
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:37,028
No, wait. I forgot the best part.

700
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,562
- Bam!
- Oh, God, we need a safe word.

701
00:31:38,595 --> 00:31:40,431
Relax, it's not for us. It's for the twins.

702
00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:42,199
I understand but I think that we need...

703
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:44,602
- We don't need a safe word.
- I want a safe word.

704
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:46,938
Why are you getting so aggressive?
It is a sausage.

705
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,072
I want a safe word.

706
00:31:48,105 --> 00:31:49,373
Is it about us crossing swords?

707
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:51,008
We can come to that when it happens.

708
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,481
Mango, mango. Our safe word is mango.

709
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:55,246
- What? How about "bite me"?
- Are you serious?

710
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,581
That's the stupidest safe word
I've ever heard in my life.

711
00:31:57,614 --> 00:31:59,918
Okay, all right, fine. Mango, it is.

712
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:02,954
So if one of us starts to feel
uncomfortable with all of this,

713
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,088
we can say "mango."

714
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:05,322
This has been a great conversation.

715
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:08,025
I'd love to continue it but I
need you to drop your pants.

716
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:09,961
- What?
- This is very important.

717
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,395
What are you talking about?

718
00:32:11,428 --> 00:32:12,496
The underpants reveal

719
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:15,032
is like the "make it or break it"
moment with chicks.

720
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:17,134
You do it right, you're mayor of Pussytown.

721
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:19,470
You do it wrong,
you're gonna go back home all by yourself

722
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:21,205
and you're gonna be doing Mr. Handyman.

723
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:24,127
You know what I'm saying?
So come on, drop them, son.

724
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,012
No, I mean, all the way.

725
00:32:28,045 --> 00:32:29,246
You're gonna laugh.

726
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,649
Buddy, I swear to you, I will not laugh.

727
00:32:36,653 --> 00:32:38,122
Oh, my God.

728
00:32:38,155 --> 00:32:39,190
Are you seriously telling me

729
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,592
you're about to go to the
twins in tighty-whiteys?

730
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:43,227
No, this is not my normal underwear.

731
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,328
I was out of underwear.

732
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:46,530
Okay, you know what,
let me show you how it's done.

733
00:32:46,563 --> 00:32:48,366
I don't think you're ready for this jelly.

734
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,034
No, yeah...

735
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:52,203
Bam! See?

736
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:53,556
That's the key right there, dude.

737
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,740
You get the chicks laughing with you,
not at you.

738
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,241
Look, dude. Let me show you.

739
00:32:57,274 --> 00:32:59,110
I got the whole animal collection in here.

740
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,446
I got another elephant. I got a snake.

741
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,581
- I got a gator, dude.
- Oh, my God.

742
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,349
I got the, uh, the thing...

743
00:33:05,382 --> 00:33:07,718
This is for, actually, like, little penises

744
00:33:07,751 --> 00:33:09,520
but I just saw, you know, you look good.

745
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:11,289
And this one is a wolf.

746
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,257
These are all proven performers.

747
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,810
I've literally used every one of these.

748
00:33:14,825 --> 00:33:18,195
Yeah, it doesn't really help
me knowing that you wore these.

749
00:33:18,228 --> 00:33:20,164
What? Dude, I've washed them.

750
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,401
Maybe not this one.
I don't think I've washed this one.

751
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,768
But the rest of them were completely clean.

752
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,571
I don't know, the elephant.

753
00:33:27,604 --> 00:33:29,240
Okay, I like what you're doing there.

754
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,075
We're going to the twins' house, you know.

755
00:33:31,108 --> 00:33:33,511
We wear matching underwear.

756
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:34,445
This is good. Put it on.

757
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,480
Would you mind not looking while I change?

758
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:37,847
Oh, yeah. No, I got you.

759
00:33:45,902 --> 00:33:47,458
They are a little big on me.

760
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:48,759
What can I say?

761
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:49,893
I mean, around the waist.

762
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:53,364
Oh, you are rocking the
thunder pants right now, bro.

763
00:33:53,397 --> 00:33:54,675
Give it the trunk lift.

764
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,333
- No.
- Just pop it up.

765
00:33:56,533 --> 00:33:57,735
Give me the trunk lift, bro.

766
00:33:57,768 --> 00:33:59,804
Get wild. Do it.

767
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,472
No, no, no. You gotta give it...

768
00:34:01,505 --> 00:34:03,607
Don't put the whole body.
Just the hips, man.

769
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:05,142
Let me show you, bro.

770
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:07,678
Gotta get it. It's like the movement.

771
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:10,247
Just fucking get the trunk...

772
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,516
No, you're going side-to-side.
Don't do side-to-side.

773
00:34:12,549 --> 00:34:13,784
- You want up and down.
- Okay.

774
00:34:13,817 --> 00:34:15,386
Up and down. Let the ball sack pop.

775
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:17,254
- That is what I'm doing.
- Ball sack pop.

776
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:18,621
Do you want some snacks?

777
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,559
Huh.

778
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,872
- Hi.
- Hi.

779
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:36,474
You having some trouble with that?

780
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:37,608
A little bit.

781
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:39,443
I can help you with the honey in there.

782
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:40,611
Oh.

783
00:34:40,644 --> 00:34:44,182
Mom, I'm not gay, okay?

784
00:34:44,848 --> 00:34:47,384
Yeah, okay.

785
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:49,120
- Okay.
- Yeah.

786
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,222
Okay. All right.

787
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,690
Just do me a favor.

788
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,625
Stay away from the glory holes, okay?

789
00:34:54,658 --> 00:34:56,760
The glory holes in the public bathroom,
stay away.

790
00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:58,829
Well, this is a school-sanctioned trip,

791
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:01,699
so I don't think there's
gonna be any glory holes.

792
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:04,335
And don't post any
pictures on that Pologram.

793
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:07,538
- It's not called Pologram.
- Whatever, the Polygram.

794
00:35:07,571 --> 00:35:09,773
The thing where you post the
pictures on the Internet.

795
00:35:09,806 --> 00:35:11,442
If you post it on the internet,
it says a lot.

796
00:35:11,475 --> 00:35:12,576
Yeah, totally.

797
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:15,146
- We're going now so I love you.
- Okay.

798
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,680
- Bye, Lisa.
- Okay.

799
00:35:16,713 --> 00:35:19,117
- Mm.
- Mm, whoa!

800
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:20,885
Okay. Bye, guys.

801
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,286
Honey, be safe.

802
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:25,790
Awesome. All right, bye.

803
00:35:26,214 --> 00:35:27,992
All right, that was my dad's guy.

804
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,560
We got the hook up.

805
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:31,328
We are on that bliss, motherfucker.

806
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:33,397
Do you think you can stop calling me that?

807
00:35:33,597 --> 00:35:35,653
- You mean motherfucker?
- Yeah, that.

808
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:37,635
Is this about my hug with Lisa?

809
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,870
Oh, no, no. It has nothing to do with that.

810
00:35:39,903 --> 00:35:41,739
It's all good, man. I can show them that.

811
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,407
You know what I mean?

812
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,743
I think it's really cool
that you and your mom talk.

813
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,745
I can talk never to my
mom about glory holes.

814
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:48,979
No, no. It's not cool.

815
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,715
This is what I have to deal with
every single day of my life.

816
00:35:51,748 --> 00:35:52,849
Cut her some slack, man.

817
00:35:52,883 --> 00:35:55,452
Your people have been through
a lot through the years.

818
00:35:55,485 --> 00:35:56,687
A little caution make sense.

819
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,422
What people? I don't have people.

820
00:35:58,455 --> 00:36:00,825
Bro, it's okay. I'm totally fine with it.

821
00:36:01,549 --> 00:36:03,661
- Fine with what?
- That you're Jewish.

822
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,497
- I'm not Jewish.
- Yeah, all right, bro.

823
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,500
I mean, it's cool if someone's Jewish,
but I'm not Jewish.

824
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:10,801
- Okay.
- Could you...?

825
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:13,204
Right, with the cover for the Volvo.

826
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,338
Okay.

827
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,473
All I'm trying to say is
you should just embrace it.

828
00:36:16,506 --> 00:36:19,243
You know, you come from a
very long and proud heritage.

829
00:36:19,276 --> 00:36:21,499
I have no idea what you're talking about.

830
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,748
- You've looked.
- I did.

831
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:26,750
But there was a mirror.
It was very easy to see.

832
00:36:26,783 --> 00:36:28,485
- Uh-huh.
- I didn't mean to.

833
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:30,454
Just because my penis is circumcised

834
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:31,922
does not mean that I'm Jewish.

835
00:36:31,955 --> 00:36:33,955
It's one of my mother's things, okay?

836
00:36:34,424 --> 00:36:36,694
Human papillomavirus and cervical cancer.

837
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:37,995
She is very big on that.

838
00:36:38,028 --> 00:36:39,496
Okay, so wait. Time out.

839
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:42,029
- So you're not Jewish.
- No, I am not Jewish.

840
00:36:42,566 --> 00:36:44,268
And neither is my penis.

841
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:45,903
Oh, God. Okay, we have to talk about this.

842
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:47,438
You gotta stop saying that word.

843
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,374
Chicks do not like it.
It's very impersonal.

844
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:52,409
You gotta come up with a name for it.

845
00:36:52,442 --> 00:36:55,446
Help the chick establish a
relationship with your dick.

846
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,615
You know, okay. Take me, for instance.

847
00:36:58,548 --> 00:37:00,551
I am Zack. This is Lil Z.

848
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:04,588
- Little Z?
- Lil Z, the Gangster of Love.

849
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:06,857
Ha, yeah, I don't know if I
would ever feel comfortable

850
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,959
talking about my penis in the third person.

851
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,462
Okay, fine. You don't have to
come up with a name for it.

852
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:12,963
But you gotta stop using the P word.

853
00:37:12,996 --> 00:37:15,333
Oh, you don't like the word penis, Zack?

854
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:16,801
- Penis.
- Don't.

855
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:20,271
<i>Penis</i>

856
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,538
Stop.

857
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:22,806
<i>Penis</i>

858
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:24,775
Why do you...?
Hey, why do you have to do that?

859
00:37:24,808 --> 00:37:26,377
There are so many other options.

860
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,978
- Like what?
- Yeah, Baloney Pony.

861
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:30,414
Hairy Banjo. The Ankle Spanker.

862
00:37:30,447 --> 00:37:32,883
Captain Winky. Jack the Dripper.

863
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:34,518
Daddy Long Stroke.

864
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:36,020
Dart of Love.

865
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,888
The, uh, Cum Pump.

866
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:39,423
Chowder Spouts.

867
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,725
The Purple-Headed Womb Ferret.

868
00:37:41,758 --> 00:37:43,647
The Steaming Semen Highway of Love.

869
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:45,372
It's actually my favorite.

870
00:37:45,629 --> 00:37:47,865
And the tallywacker.

871
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:50,668
- The tallywacker?
- Yeah.

872
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,636
I mean,
it's obscure but it's perfectly valid.

873
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:55,272
Oh, you obviously spend way
too much time on the Internet.

874
00:37:55,472 --> 00:37:57,441
How are we supposed to
know who this person is?

875
00:37:57,474 --> 00:37:58,994
Well, I told him we're on a pink Volvo.

876
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:00,811
- It's salmon.
- It's salmon.

877
00:38:00,844 --> 00:38:03,747
- Do you even know this person?
- Yes, I do, okay?

878
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,684
It's my dad's guy's guy. Disaster.

879
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:10,521
Oh, we're waiting around for
somebody whose name is Disaster?

880
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,356
Yes, but it's a street name.

881
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:13,791
No, I understand it's a street name.

882
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:15,459
But how do you think he got the name?

883
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:16,593
I have no idea.

884
00:38:16,626 --> 00:38:17,794
- It's probably flipped.
- What?

885
00:38:17,827 --> 00:38:20,431
Okay, like how they call small,
skinny guys Big-something?

886
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,432
It's like that.

887
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,534
He's probably the least
disastrous guy around.

888
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,936
That makes me feel so much
better that we're waiting around

889
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:27,938
for the least disastrous
person named Disaster.

890
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:29,106
Oh, my God!

891
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:30,841
- What the fuck's your prob?
- Nothing.

892
00:38:30,874 --> 00:38:32,476
What's up, my man? You got the shit?

893
00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:34,378
- You got my money?
- Oh, dude, no doubt.

894
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:35,713
Um, what's it gonna be?

895
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,882
It's gonna be $30, a tab, four tabs, 140.

896
00:38:38,915 --> 00:38:40,584
No, no, that's actually 120.

897
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:41,852
What the fuck did you say?

898
00:38:41,885 --> 00:38:44,421
Okay, wait. We got, what,
80 from the twins?

899
00:38:44,454 --> 00:38:45,455
Eighty?

900
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,891
- There's some change here.
- We got it.

901
00:38:47,924 --> 00:38:49,393
No, no, it's okay. I got this.

902
00:38:49,426 --> 00:38:50,694
You punk ass.

903
00:38:50,727 --> 00:38:52,096
Son of a bitches!

904
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:53,630
We're not gonna...

905
00:38:53,663 --> 00:38:54,832
You son of a bitches.

906
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:56,033
Sir? Sir.

907
00:38:56,066 --> 00:38:59,636
You're getting extremely,
extremely angry over nothing.

908
00:38:59,669 --> 00:39:02,740
I'm gonna rip the ribs off you,
motherfucker.

909
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,074
Give me that. Give me that.

910
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:06,610
- It's 157 and change.
- There it is, right there.

911
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:07,745
There's change there

912
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,480
and we'll get the rest to you tomorrow.

913
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,715
- We're good for it, I promise.
- Actually, $20 short.

914
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:13,651
We're actually overpaying you.

915
00:39:14,017 --> 00:39:16,620
- All right.
- What the fuck did you say?

916
00:39:16,653 --> 00:39:18,155
Um, nothing.

917
00:39:18,188 --> 00:39:19,490
It's exactly...

918
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,425
Hey, hey, I got an idea, okay?

919
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:22,626
What?

920
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:24,904
- Hurry that shit up.
- Right there.

921
00:39:26,096 --> 00:39:27,498
See what we got here.

922
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,222
That's some good shit.

923
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:33,590
Oh, no, I'm good. Thank you though.

924
00:39:35,205 --> 00:39:37,975
- Oh, no, no.
- No, you suck my butter finger.

925
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,710
He's, uh... He can't have dairy.

926
00:39:39,743 --> 00:39:40,978
So there's more for me.

927
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,680
- That's right.
- Ha-ha-ha.

928
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,653
Is this what it's supposed to look like?

929
00:39:49,686 --> 00:39:51,722
- What did you say?
- No, he didn't say anything.

930
00:39:51,755 --> 00:39:52,990
He was just asking a question.

931
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,692
We're doing business.

932
00:39:55,692 --> 00:39:57,359
- Hit me up anytime.
- Will do.

933
00:39:57,594 --> 00:39:58,863
Hey, Leroy!

934
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:01,899
- I guess he didn't flip it.
- Yeah, you think?

935
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,001
Eyes on the prize, brother.
We got the bliss.

936
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,602
Let's pack this shit up and go.

937
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:07,704
Okay, yeah,
we have to talk about those groceries.

938
00:40:07,737 --> 00:40:08,839
It's ridiculous.

939
00:40:08,872 --> 00:40:10,908
The sausage, in particular.

940
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,497
What is there to talk about?

941
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:14,545
What the fu...?

942
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,181
Where is this thing called bliss?

943
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:18,549
We don't have it.

944
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:20,517
No, I'm not fucking around.

945
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,819
It's downtown.

946
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:22,887
Yeah, keep talking, dipshit.

947
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,155
Can we take a deep breath
and chill for a second?

948
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:27,124
There's a Salvadorian dude called Lambache.

949
00:40:27,157 --> 00:40:28,992
He works out at the pool hall down on Abby.

950
00:40:29,025 --> 00:40:31,028
Lambache. What's the last name?

951
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,831
- It's a street name.
- This better be for real.

952
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,566
- Or I swear to God...
- Yeah, I get it.

953
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,967
You will fucking kill me and shit.

954
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,101
- Yeah, yeah.
- Don't...

955
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,913
- Get out of my face.
- Have fun with that, ladies.

956
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:45,175
Oh, they are fucked.

957
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:46,143
What are you talking about?

958
00:40:46,176 --> 00:40:48,178
My dad's guy told me that the Salvadorians

959
00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:50,981
are literally the craziest
motherfuckers in town.

960
00:40:51,014 --> 00:40:52,850
And, uh, last time I heard,

961
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,085
Lambache is gangbanger for suck ass.

962
00:40:55,118 --> 00:40:56,487
What?

963
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,055
No, no, no, Zack. Zack, no, no.

964
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:00,791
This is getting way more than I can handle.

965
00:41:00,824 --> 00:41:02,960
I mean, I've been brutalized
more the last half hour

966
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,962
than I've ever been my entire life.

967
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:07,598
I think it's just...
It's better if I just go home.

968
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,966
No, Allan, stop. Stop.

969
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,068
You stood tall, man.

970
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,537
You didn't punk out and tell
him where the bliss was.

971
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,805
I was too scared to punk out.

972
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:16,273
That still counts, my man.

973
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:18,575
Look, the hard part is over.

974
00:41:18,608 --> 00:41:19,844
We got the bliss.

975
00:41:20,777 --> 00:41:22,579
It's taco time.

976
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:29,152
No, no, no, shit, shit.

977
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:37,227
I, uh...

978
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,163
Oh, you're gonna love this.

979
00:41:40,964 --> 00:41:42,833
Boo!

980
00:41:42,866 --> 00:41:43,967
Wah!

981
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,970
Genealogical implications aside,

982
00:41:47,003 --> 00:41:49,039
let's pretend for a moment
that we're not talking

983
00:41:49,072 --> 00:41:50,874
about a thinly-encased tube of dead animal

984
00:41:50,907 --> 00:41:52,187
with toxins and preservatives...

985
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:53,310
It's a sausage.

986
00:41:53,343 --> 00:41:54,845
Okay, fine, fine. It's a sausage.

987
00:41:54,878 --> 00:41:56,146
But it's still incest.

988
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:57,948
Not when it's with twins, man.

989
00:41:57,981 --> 00:42:00,717
What are you talking about?
Especially when it's twins.

990
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,310
Fucker, what is your problem right now?

991
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,888
I just don't feel comfortable
showing up to their front door

992
00:42:04,921 --> 00:42:07,124
with a bunch of over-sexualized groceries.

993
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:08,892
I mean, how do you even begin to explain

994
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:10,694
the two tubs of butter back there?

995
00:42:10,727 --> 00:42:12,563
Let alone the three-foot sausage.

996
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,298
They're gonna think we're perverts.

997
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,700
Allan, there are times,

998
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:18,335
and I believe tonight is one of them,

999
00:42:18,368 --> 00:42:19,503
where freaky just happens.

1000
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:22,005
Choco pudding just doesn't happen,
you have to add milk

1001
00:42:22,038 --> 00:42:24,608
and you have to let it sit in
the fridge at least an hour.

1002
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:27,644
Oh, and showing up with
aloe and tissues is okay?

1003
00:42:27,677 --> 00:42:29,313
Come on. They're gonna think we have colds.

1004
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:30,814
It's a great start right there.

1005
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:32,082
"Hey, ladies. Nice to see you.

1006
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:33,584
We're sick. Let's fuck."

1007
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:34,885
Tissues are thoughtful.

1008
00:42:34,918 --> 00:42:36,653
Now, a three-foot sausage is disgusting.

1009
00:42:36,686 --> 00:42:39,056
Even if they're lesbians,
they wouldn't be interested in it.

1010
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:40,791
Should I have brought, like, a zucchini

1011
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:41,959
or a cucumber or something?

1012
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,760
No, lesbians aren't interested in penises

1013
00:42:43,793 --> 00:42:45,028
or things resembling penises.

1014
00:42:45,061 --> 00:42:47,061
That's why they're lesbians. Come on.

1015
00:42:47,297 --> 00:42:49,266
That is so wrong what you just said.

1016
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:56,006
Try to connect with your
inner badass, okay?

1017
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:57,608
I don't have an inner badass.

1018
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,810
Everyone has an inner badass.

1019
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,945
Zack and Lil Z are in the house.

1020
00:43:01,978 --> 00:43:03,780
I thought you guys were gonna call first?

1021
00:43:03,813 --> 00:43:04,948
So do you have the bliss?

1022
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:06,750
Oh, hells, yeah!

1023
00:43:07,717 --> 00:43:09,753
So is that your street name?

1024
00:43:09,786 --> 00:43:11,688
- What?
- Lil Z, is that...?

1025
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:12,756
Oh, no, no, no.

1026
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:15,225
That's just the name that
Zack calls the sausage

1027
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:17,094
that he's holding in his hand.

1028
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:19,162
Oh, the sausage has a name?

1029
00:43:19,195 --> 00:43:20,731
Mm-hm.

1030
00:43:21,998 --> 00:43:25,387
You know prisoners hide their
phones in their rectal cavities?

1031
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:28,071
You mean, they put them up their butts?

1032
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:29,640
Mm-hm. Yeah.

1033
00:43:30,206 --> 00:43:31,408
Prison's no joke.

1034
00:43:31,441 --> 00:43:33,243
How do they get them out?

1035
00:43:33,276 --> 00:43:34,812
I have no idea.

1036
00:43:38,607 --> 00:43:41,885
Oh, God. I can't believe we're
this close to the Lane twins.

1037
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:43,820
We're like a hundred
feet from their bedroom.

1038
00:43:43,853 --> 00:43:46,520
Dude,
you are literally spiraling out of control.

1039
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:52,096
Holy shit.

1040
00:43:52,462 --> 00:43:53,931
Oh, my God.

1041
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:02,673
Okay. Let's do it, boys.

1042
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,675
Strip it down. Ha-ha-ha.

1043
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,243
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1044
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,278
For sure.

1045
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:11,014
So ready right now.

1046
00:44:11,047 --> 00:44:12,282
Allan, let's do this.

1047
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:15,686
Um, I don't...

1048
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,287
I don't think I can do this...

1049
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,356
Shh, just follow my lead, okay?

1050
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:22,225
Just take it off. Where is it going?

1051
00:44:22,258 --> 00:44:23,794
There, right?

1052
00:44:24,761 --> 00:44:26,261
Give it down. Give it down.

1053
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:29,066
You ready for the monster?

1054
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,434
I don't think you are.

1055
00:44:31,847 --> 00:44:33,236
Yeah, there it is, right?

1056
00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:34,705
Whoa!

1057
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,850
Have you ever played Capture-The-Snake?

1058
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:38,308
Right?

1059
00:44:40,777 --> 00:44:42,666
I'll give you a little bit of this.

1060
00:44:44,047 --> 00:44:45,148
Mm.

1061
00:44:45,181 --> 00:44:47,050
- Oh!
- Give it a little drag.

1062
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:49,583
Give it a little drag.
I'm creeping up on you.

1063
00:44:51,087 --> 00:44:52,222
I'm coming for you.

1064
00:44:52,789 --> 00:44:54,791
- Papa's coming.
- Awesome.

1065
00:44:54,824 --> 00:44:56,026
Watch out, ladies.

1066
00:44:56,059 --> 00:44:58,095
Watch out. How's the marble head?

1067
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,264
- All right, let's go.
- Let's go, brother.

1068
00:45:01,297 --> 00:45:02,742
- Let's do this.
- Come on.

1069
00:45:05,468 --> 00:45:07,580
- Give them the good stuff.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1070
00:45:07,804 --> 00:45:09,273
Ladies.

1071
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,408
Take the shirt... Shirt off.

1072
00:45:14,277 --> 00:45:15,813
Take it off, Allan.

1073
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,314
Okay. Ha, ha.

1074
00:45:23,086 --> 00:45:24,387
Oh, my God!

1075
00:45:33,863 --> 00:45:35,132
You're good.

1076
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,368
Okay, should we be taking
some hardcore drugs right now?

1077
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:39,770
Oh.

1078
00:45:41,104 --> 00:45:43,774
That's awesome, brother. That is awesome.

1079
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,908
That's brilliant.

1080
00:45:44,941 --> 00:45:46,243
He's ready to unleash the bliss.

1081
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:48,221
- Let's do it.
- Here's one for you.

1082
00:45:49,245 --> 00:45:52,182
One for you. One for me.

1083
00:45:52,215 --> 00:45:53,917
Okay, let's take them on three. Ready?

1084
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:56,319
One, two, three.

1085
00:45:56,352 --> 00:45:58,388
I think this is<i> gingko biloba.</i>

1086
00:45:58,421 --> 00:46:01,091
- What are you talking about?
- There's GB etched in the side.

1087
00:46:01,124 --> 00:46:02,192
What's<i> gingko biloba?</i>

1088
00:46:02,225 --> 00:46:05,059
It's just an herbal supplement.
It helps for memory.

1089
00:46:05,428 --> 00:46:06,864
My grandmother takes one.

1090
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,533
Ugh.

1091
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,904
That motherfucker better
get what's coming to him.

1092
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,505
I'm gonna kick him right in the shaft.

1093
00:46:15,538 --> 00:46:17,908
Mm.

1094
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:20,277
Who wants chocolate pudding?

1095
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,312
No, I'll be able to find it. It's all good.

1096
00:46:22,512 --> 00:46:23,814
Okay. Bye.

1097
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:24,748
Ladies, we are good.

1098
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,516
I just found a new connect on the bliss.

1099
00:46:26,549 --> 00:46:28,385
So we, we're gonna make this right.

1100
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:29,920
And don't come back until you do.

1101
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,509
Yeah, and take your pudding.

1102
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:38,507
Look, I understand that you're
really upset with me but...

1103
00:46:38,528 --> 00:46:40,528
Why would I be upset with you, Allan?

1104
00:46:41,112 --> 00:46:44,501
An hour ago, we are in a hot tub
with twins, riding our jocks.

1105
00:46:44,534 --> 00:46:47,103
- And then you single-handedly...
- What am I suppose to say?

1106
00:46:47,136 --> 00:46:48,371
Nothing!

1107
00:46:48,404 --> 00:46:50,106
You missed an excellent opportunity

1108
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:52,042
to say absolutely nothing!

1109
00:46:52,332 --> 00:46:54,277
We all get some improved blood flow.

1110
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:55,445
No harm. No foul.

1111
00:46:55,478 --> 00:46:56,880
- I'm sorry.
- Jesus!

1112
00:46:56,913 --> 00:46:58,982
No, you know what, that has to be

1113
00:46:59,015 --> 00:47:01,518
the most massive self-inflicted cock block

1114
00:47:01,551 --> 00:47:02,853
in the history of fucking.

1115
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:04,609
- I said I'm sorry, okay?
- Unh.

1116
00:47:04,809 --> 00:47:06,189
I tell you this right now.

1117
00:47:06,222 --> 00:47:07,457
You are a lucky motherfucker.

1118
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:09,492
I got a line on some bliss downtown, okay?

1119
00:47:09,525 --> 00:47:12,329
It's gonna cost us like
75 bucks or something.

1120
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:13,297
Do you have any money?

1121
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,365
No, I gave it all to you
for the fake bliss.

1122
00:47:15,398 --> 00:47:17,334
- Do you have a credit card?
- Absolutely not.

1123
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,335
- The fees are through the roof.
- Oh.

1124
00:47:19,535 --> 00:47:21,147
Do you have any cash at home?

1125
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:24,641
Come on, Allan. Where's the cash?

1126
00:47:24,674 --> 00:47:26,730
Okay, fine. But it's in my Volvo fund.

1127
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:28,979
And besides, we can't even go back there.

1128
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,413
My mom thinks that we're gay camping

1129
00:47:30,446 --> 00:47:32,315
or glory-holing or something like that,

1130
00:47:32,348 --> 00:47:34,417
which, by the way, is
completely your fault.

1131
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,286
Allan, Allan, stop.

1132
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,890
The Lane twins, you know?

1133
00:47:40,356 --> 00:47:45,262
Like, "Oh, oh, Allan. Oh, that's so good.

1134
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:48,665
Allan, just, oh, just the tip.
Just the tip."

1135
00:47:48,698 --> 00:47:50,200
- Fine, fine.
- Mm.

1136
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,035
Fine.

1137
00:47:52,702 --> 00:47:55,105
Move it.

1138
00:47:57,206 --> 00:48:00,010
Shh... Be very quiet.

1139
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,084
My mother is a very light sleeper.

1140
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,676
Oh, what the fuck?

1141
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:35,655
Let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1142
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:42,485
Is that like a relative or something?

1143
00:48:42,518 --> 00:48:44,087
No, no, he's not a relative.

1144
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,189
I've never seen that guy
before in my entire life.

1145
00:48:46,222 --> 00:48:48,058
Did you see the size of his dick, dude?

1146
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,960
He can probably suck it all by himself.

1147
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:52,095
- Great, thank you.
- Just lying flat on his back.

1148
00:48:52,128 --> 00:48:54,164
- Zack, shut up.
- Even when he's not hard.

1149
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,099
I'm just saying, your mom's a lucky girl.

1150
00:48:56,132 --> 00:48:57,467
Let's go. Chop, chop.

1151
00:49:00,603 --> 00:49:03,039
Oh, that's a real good hiding place.

1152
00:49:03,072 --> 00:49:04,308
Let's go.

1153
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:16,320
Let's play peek-a-boo!

1154
00:49:18,087 --> 00:49:20,023
No, that's my mother's room.

1155
00:49:20,056 --> 00:49:21,424
Don't go in there. Stop it.

1156
00:49:21,624 --> 00:49:24,461
Okay, I'll be right there.

1157
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:29,232
Wait, let me put some
sexy music to bang to.

1158
00:49:29,265 --> 00:49:30,734
Oh, ha, ha.

1159
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:33,169
I see somebody found the meat drawer.

1160
00:49:33,202 --> 00:49:36,239
Yeah, how's your meat drawer doing?

1161
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:39,075
Well, it's a little empty at the moment.

1162
00:49:39,108 --> 00:49:41,077
Yeah, well, not for long.

1163
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:42,212
Hot!

1164
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,748
- Stop it, stop it.
- Fuck.

1165
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,449
- Don't worry.
- Stop it.

1166
00:49:46,482 --> 00:49:48,051
I think I found the sausage.

1167
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,226
Oh, yeah!

1168
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:03,633
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

1169
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,404
Do it, baby! Do it! Oh, oh!

1170
00:50:11,187 --> 00:50:13,243
Wait, wait. I think we broke the door.

1171
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,445
Not a problem, baby. I can fix anything.

1172
00:50:15,478 --> 00:50:19,249
Yeah, you just gotta get this,
uh, thing back in the track.

1173
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:22,218
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1174
00:50:22,251 --> 00:50:23,863
It's his cock. It's his cock.

1175
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,356
- His dick.
- Yeah, there you go.

1176
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:29,426
But the bottom part, now that, ugh,

1177
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:31,061
that's a little tricky.

1178
00:50:32,862 --> 00:50:34,564
Yeah, there you go.

1179
00:50:34,597 --> 00:50:37,333
Oh, that sweet meat.
I'm ready for my sandwich.

1180
00:50:37,366 --> 00:50:38,535
Where did I put that?

1181
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:40,470
Don't worry, post fucking,

1182
00:50:40,503 --> 00:50:42,272
they'll be asleep within a few seconds.

1183
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:43,340
This is awesome.

1184
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:44,674
What are you doing?

1185
00:50:44,707 --> 00:50:46,374
I already posted it to Tumblr.

1186
00:50:46,776 --> 00:50:48,478
- I'm just...
- Get out.

1187
00:50:50,379 --> 00:50:51,848
Jesus.

1188
00:50:51,881 --> 00:50:54,084
He has some staying power.

1189
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,519
Wait, wait, wait.

1190
00:50:56,552 --> 00:50:57,487
Okay.

1191
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,798
We'll be stuck in this closet all weekend.

1192
00:51:00,523 --> 00:51:03,259
I'll never sleep in this house ever again.

1193
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:06,196
Dude, you are looking at
this the totally wrong way.

1194
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,131
Okay, Lisa's a very sexual being.

1195
00:51:08,164 --> 00:51:09,766
- This is beautiful.
- No.

1196
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:11,401
This is not beautiful.

1197
00:51:11,737 --> 00:51:14,237
- And stop calling her Lisa.
- She told me to.

1198
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:15,772
I don't care what she told you.

1199
00:51:15,805 --> 00:51:17,740
She obviously has very poor judgment.

1200
00:51:17,773 --> 00:51:20,810
Otherwise, there wouldn't be a very,
very, very hairy naked man

1201
00:51:20,843 --> 00:51:22,445
running train on my mother.

1202
00:51:22,478 --> 00:51:25,181
Running train?
It's not even the proper term for it.

1203
00:51:25,214 --> 00:51:27,550
Whatever, fine. Riding train, I don't care.

1204
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:29,652
Stop.
You are making it sound like he's a hobo.

1205
00:51:29,685 --> 00:51:31,788
- You think he's a hobo?
- I don't know.

1206
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:34,224
All I'm saying is,
if I was swinging a babe like that,

1207
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,525
I wouldn't shave either.

1208
00:51:35,558 --> 00:51:37,560
I'll just be like, "Hey, I'm hairy.

1209
00:51:37,593 --> 00:51:40,196
Check out my enormous, hairy dick."

1210
00:51:40,229 --> 00:51:43,867
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
My mom's flying with a hobo.

1211
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,678
Will you get off the hobo thing?

1212
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,675
Yeah, baby.

1213
00:51:52,767 --> 00:51:55,545
If there is so much as one
pube in my refrigerator,

1214
00:51:55,578 --> 00:51:56,613
I am leaving home.

1215
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:58,681
I'm becoming a ward of the state,
I don't care.

1216
00:51:58,714 --> 00:52:01,584
And you know what, I support that decision.

1217
00:52:01,617 --> 00:52:03,820
But we need to focus on what lies ahead.

1218
00:52:03,853 --> 00:52:06,289
Scoring that bliss and
getting back to the twins.

1219
00:52:06,322 --> 00:52:08,258
- Are you with me? Okay.
- Okay.

1220
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,660
It's not about your mom
getting her freak on.

1221
00:52:10,693 --> 00:52:11,794
- No, it's not.
- Good.

1222
00:52:11,827 --> 00:52:13,830
So the cock all up in your mom, dude,

1223
00:52:13,863 --> 00:52:15,598
and she is taking him like a...

1224
00:52:15,631 --> 00:52:16,833
It's not helping.

1225
00:52:16,866 --> 00:52:18,701
Okay, you know what, yeah, you're right.

1226
00:52:18,734 --> 00:52:20,670
You're absolutely right, but damn!

1227
00:52:20,703 --> 00:52:22,272
Wait, I haven't found it yet.

1228
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,940
Oh, oh, yes. Work it out, work it out.

1229
00:52:23,973 --> 00:52:25,642
- Okay!
- Okay, it's now or never.

1230
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:26,776
Okay. Okay.

1231
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:28,344
- What?
- Go! Go!

1232
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,352
Oh, yeah, baby. Do it.

1233
00:52:35,985 --> 00:52:37,453
Aha! Yeah, baby!

1234
00:52:37,486 --> 00:52:39,455
Put your fucking phone away.

1235
00:52:39,488 --> 00:52:41,224
Okay. Okay.

1236
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:53,670
There's no way we're getting in here.

1237
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:55,572
Don't you worry. I'll handle it.

1238
00:52:56,839 --> 00:52:58,742
Ah, hmm, come on.

1239
00:53:06,382 --> 00:53:07,650
- Yeah!
- Come on.

1240
00:53:07,683 --> 00:53:09,286
Get out! Come on!

1241
00:53:09,685 --> 00:53:11,321
Come on!

1242
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,589
Make way!

1243
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:20,263
When they said cock fighting,

1244
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:23,909
I assumed that there
would be birds involved.

1245
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:26,302
- This never happened.
- Okay.

1246
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:28,905
We'll never talk about this again, ever!

1247
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:31,875
- It's just...
- I said ever, man.

1248
00:53:47,556 --> 00:53:49,259
Not gonna happen, little man.

1249
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:50,727
No way, no how.

1250
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,263
I'm sorry. Do you not know who I am?

1251
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:54,497
What don't you enlighten me?

1252
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:56,633
I am Joe Celisco's kid.

1253
00:53:56,666 --> 00:54:00,837
- You are Joe Celisco's kid.
- Yeah, "The." Yeah.

1254
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,772
I though you said your name is Kowalski.

1255
00:54:02,805 --> 00:54:05,675
Yeah, no, no,
that's just for witness protection.

1256
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,579
My apologies, Mr. Celisco. Welcome.

1257
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:11,248
My man.

1258
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:22,892
Wow.

1259
00:54:28,964 --> 00:54:31,000
Right this way, Mr. Celisco.

1260
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:33,302
Actually,
we're looking for some Bangkok Bliss.

1261
00:54:33,502 --> 00:54:34,804
Think you can help us with that?

1262
00:54:34,837 --> 00:54:37,004
For the boss' son, anything is possible.

1263
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:42,045
Whoa! Allan, are you seeing this?

1264
00:54:42,878 --> 00:54:45,323
Here's what's happening.
Who's having a ride?

1265
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:47,717
Ah!

1266
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:49,907
Oh, man, you smell pathetic.

1267
00:54:53,422 --> 00:54:55,358
So you're Joe Celisco's kid.

1268
00:54:55,391 --> 00:54:57,727
Oh, no, no, no. That's him over there.

1269
00:54:59,464 --> 00:55:01,464
You're looking for some Bliss, right?

1270
00:55:01,497 --> 00:55:03,633
Um, yes. Yes, yes, thank you.

1271
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:06,903
Okay, thank you so much.
How much do I owe you?

1272
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:08,548
Oh, no, no, stop. It's on me.

1273
00:55:08,871 --> 00:55:11,441
Are you sure? Thank you.

1274
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,710
Oh, tell him his uncle wants
to see him in his office.

1275
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:16,688
Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
I'll give him the message.

1276
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:19,582
Look what I got.

1277
00:55:19,615 --> 00:55:21,584
Oh! Dude, what did I tell you?

1278
00:55:21,617 --> 00:55:23,486
Am I a player in this town or what?

1279
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:26,242
Are we not living the dream right now?
Are we not?

1280
00:55:26,555 --> 00:55:29,459
- Yeah, man. Yes, we are.
- Unh.

1281
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,661
By the way,
your uncle wants to see you in his office

1282
00:55:31,694 --> 00:55:32,696
before we go.

1283
00:55:32,895 --> 00:55:33,963
- My uncle?
- Yeah.

1284
00:55:34,997 --> 00:55:37,467
Oh, we gotta go. Ladies, bye.

1285
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,945
- Get up.
- You're leaving?

1286
00:55:39,535 --> 00:55:42,672
Zack. Zack, what's wrong?
Why are you freaking out?

1287
00:55:42,705 --> 00:55:44,040
We're having a great time.

1288
00:55:44,073 --> 00:55:45,629
Look, we gotta go. Let's go.

1289
00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:47,077
Oh, wait, wait. I, I, I...

1290
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:49,555
I don't think we're
supposed to be back here.

1291
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,047
Okay.

1292
00:55:51,814 --> 00:55:52,782
Listen, Allan.

1293
00:55:52,815 --> 00:55:54,951
Allan, we can't go back out there,
all right?

1294
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:58,054
- Why not?
- Because I lied.

1295
00:55:58,866 --> 00:56:00,089
What? Lied about what?

1296
00:56:00,122 --> 00:56:01,991
It's not my dad in prison, all right?

1297
00:56:02,024 --> 00:56:03,126
It's my dumbass brother

1298
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,827
on some bullshit joyriding charge.

1299
00:56:05,027 --> 00:56:06,361
I don't even have a dad.

1300
00:56:06,561 --> 00:56:08,564
What do you mean you don't have a dad?

1301
00:56:08,597 --> 00:56:10,566
- Everybody has a dad.
- No, I have a dad.

1302
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:12,822
I'm just saying that I don't know my dad.

1303
00:56:15,037 --> 00:56:16,406
Then who is Joe Celisco?

1304
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:18,079
Oh, he's some, like, a hotshot Mafia guy.

1305
00:56:18,107 --> 00:56:19,742
He's in prison with my brother.

1306
00:56:19,775 --> 00:56:21,275
What are you talking about?

1307
00:56:22,044 --> 00:56:24,047
Dude, enough with the questions.

1308
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:25,849
Mafia guy?

1309
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:28,017
My brother told me if I came here

1310
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,152
and I said I was Joe Celisco's son,

1311
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:30,520
I can get whatever I want.

1312
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,954
Didn't say anything about an uncle.

1313
00:56:31,987 --> 00:56:33,523
How could you do this to me?

1314
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,501
I'm sorry,
but we are wasting valuable time right now.

1315
00:56:36,701 --> 00:56:38,428
- We need to do something.
- Like what?

1316
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:41,164
I don't know. Find like an emergency exit.

1317
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:42,765
Or a trash chute or something.

1318
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:44,967
A trash chute? We're behind the bar.

1319
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,102
- Ow.
- Fix this.

1320
00:56:46,135 --> 00:56:47,604
- Fix it.
- Okay.

1321
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:50,406
You ladies weren't planning on leaving,
were you?

1322
00:56:50,606 --> 00:56:51,608
Come with me.

1323
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:53,576
Now!

1324
00:56:55,811 --> 00:56:58,548
It's not that fucking complicated.

1325
00:56:58,781 --> 00:57:01,017
You dig a hole, you drop the fucker in,

1326
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:02,685
you fill the hole back up.

1327
00:57:02,718 --> 00:57:04,487
Is that so hard? Huh?

1328
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:06,656
Is that beyond your capabilities?

1329
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,758
If it is, then I'll do it myself

1330
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:11,461
with my bare fucking hands!

1331
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:17,299
My apologies, gentlemen.

1332
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,203
Doing some landscaping.
Nothing extravagant.

1333
00:57:21,136 --> 00:57:24,174
Ornamental trees, shrubs.
A minor water effect.

1334
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,543
- Sounds really nice.
- Yeah.

1335
00:57:27,042 --> 00:57:30,265
How long do you think something
like that should, uh, take?

1336
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:35,151
Mr. Celisco asked you a direct question.

1337
00:57:35,184 --> 00:57:36,686
- Two weeks?
- Maybe three.

1338
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:38,221
Two weeks. Maybe three.

1339
00:57:38,668 --> 00:57:41,057
I've been dealing with
that clown landscaper

1340
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:42,225
for the past six months.

1341
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:44,527
The planting season for the magnolias,

1342
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,062
that is gone, that is finished.

1343
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:48,998
My imported ficus are
turning black as we speak.

1344
00:57:49,832 --> 00:57:52,001
Did you have something you wanted to say?

1345
00:57:52,034 --> 00:57:54,136
No? Good.

1346
00:57:54,169 --> 00:57:57,173
Let's, let's talk about you.

1347
00:57:57,706 --> 00:57:59,575
- Now.
- What?

1348
00:57:59,608 --> 00:58:02,645
You, being a fucktard of epic proportions,

1349
00:58:02,678 --> 00:58:04,581
decided it was a brilliant idea

1350
00:58:05,059 --> 00:58:06,282
to impersonate the son

1351
00:58:06,315 --> 00:58:08,818
of my beloved and incarcerated brother

1352
00:58:08,851 --> 00:58:12,288
in order that you could
party in my VIP room.

1353
00:58:12,321 --> 00:58:16,025
And you, being a fucktard-in-training,

1354
00:58:16,058 --> 00:58:17,660
thought it was a good idea.

1355
00:58:17,693 --> 00:58:19,562
"I think I'll go along for the ride."

1356
00:58:19,595 --> 00:58:20,696
Aphids.

1357
00:58:20,729 --> 00:58:22,098
What did you call Mr. Celisco?

1358
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:24,534
Your ficus probably has aphids.

1359
00:58:25,067 --> 00:58:26,970
Oh, so that's... It's okay, Larry.

1360
00:58:27,236 --> 00:58:28,671
Fine.

1361
00:58:28,704 --> 00:58:30,840
They suck the sap out of the leaves,

1362
00:58:30,873 --> 00:58:32,275
and that's what turns them black.

1363
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:33,510
Oh, really?

1364
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:38,748
Well, how do you get rid of them, hotshot?

1365
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:40,171
Spray them with water.

1366
00:58:40,983 --> 00:58:42,519
Are you fucking with me?

1367
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:45,453
Because if you're fucking with me,

1368
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:47,355
I'll take your head off.

1369
00:58:47,903 --> 00:58:49,292
I'll shit down your neck.

1370
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:50,626
No, I would never,

1371
00:58:50,659 --> 00:58:52,194
I would never, I would never do that.

1372
00:58:52,227 --> 00:58:55,298
There are some commercially
available pesticides

1373
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:57,867
but spraying them with
water does the trick.

1374
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,769
And it's much more
environmentally-friendly.

1375
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:01,858
Yeah, yeah. I hate that chemical shit.

1376
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:04,273
I mean, we don't own the Earth, do we?

1377
00:59:04,306 --> 00:59:07,777
We're, we're merely its caretakers.
Yada-yada.

1378
00:59:08,644 --> 00:59:09,579
Yeah.

1379
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:12,882
- Ha, ha, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

1380
00:59:12,915 --> 00:59:16,304
You just spray it with water,
and the bugs fall off the plant,

1381
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:17,853
two or three times...

1382
00:59:17,886 --> 00:59:19,220
Hold that thought. Yeah?

1383
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:22,759
Shut up. Shut up.

1384
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,229
Now, listen, I got it from good authority

1385
00:59:26,942 --> 00:59:28,331
that it is aphids, right?

1386
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:30,300
Aphids fucking with my ficus.

1387
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:35,138
Now I want you to spray them with water,
very aggressively,

1388
00:59:35,704 --> 00:59:36,806
right now.

1389
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:37,840
Ye...

1390
00:59:39,141 --> 00:59:40,643
We didn't think of that.

1391
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:44,080
We didn't think of that!

1392
00:59:48,183 --> 00:59:49,295
Okay. They're on it.

1393
00:59:50,052 --> 00:59:51,054
So...

1394
00:59:53,088 --> 00:59:54,824
- You can go now.
- Right now?

1395
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:55,858
Right now.

1396
00:59:56,892 --> 00:59:57,892
What the hell.

1397
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:03,333
Larry, have somebody turn on my porn.

1398
01:00:10,372 --> 01:00:12,675
Allan, that, that was genius.

1399
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:14,268
What you did up there, that was amazing.

1400
01:00:14,276 --> 01:00:15,211
Aphids are common.

1401
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:17,780
Now, you got a gig with Celisco.
It's like...

1402
01:00:17,813 --> 01:00:19,982
No, no, no,
I don't know how comfortable I'd feel

1403
01:00:20,015 --> 01:00:21,684
actually gardening for the Mafia.

1404
01:00:21,717 --> 01:00:23,252
What, what are you talking about?

1405
01:00:23,452 --> 01:00:25,354
- You're connected now.
- Maybe.

1406
01:00:25,387 --> 01:00:29,025
No, you are.
Plus, I got the Bliss, so we're good.

1407
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:31,170
We make a pretty good team, am I right?

1408
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:34,664
Yeah. I guess we do.

1409
01:00:35,364 --> 01:00:37,100
My man. Hah.

1410
01:00:38,233 --> 01:00:39,936
- Oh, my God.
- Let's go.

1411
01:00:55,919 --> 01:00:58,053
Get down on the ground. Right now, do it.

1412
01:00:58,253 --> 01:00:59,976
Down on the ground, now. Do it.

1413
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:03,859
Unit 4-1.

1414
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:05,928
I've apprehended two white males in flight.

1415
01:01:05,961 --> 01:01:06,961
Ha-ha. Suckers.

1416
01:01:09,967 --> 01:01:12,134
- Zack, get rid of the Bliss.
- I can't.

1417
01:01:12,334 --> 01:01:14,036
- You dirt bags on paper?
- What?

1418
01:01:14,069 --> 01:01:15,438
Are you on parole, fucknuts?

1419
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:16,673
No, no, no.

1420
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:18,207
- What is this?
- Ow.

1421
01:01:19,098 --> 01:01:21,043
"Stay true. Stay cool." What's this?

1422
01:01:21,076 --> 01:01:22,277
I can explain what that is.

1423
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:24,947
We're two virgins,
and that is our field trip permission.

1424
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:27,783
No, there is no two.
He is a virgin, I am not.

1425
01:01:27,816 --> 01:01:29,018
Okay? I had sex on... Unh.

1426
01:01:29,051 --> 01:01:31,187
Okay, okay. Okay.

1427
01:01:31,887 --> 01:01:34,832
- You holding anything?
- Wait, wait, that's not ours.

1428
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:36,225
Stay there.

1429
01:01:36,992 --> 01:01:38,437
Stand up. What's not ours?

1430
01:01:38,637 --> 01:01:40,162
Come here. Get up against the wall.

1431
01:01:40,195 --> 01:01:42,699
Come on, it's okay. Hey, what's not ours?

1432
01:01:43,465 --> 01:01:45,201
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

1433
01:01:46,738 --> 01:01:48,738
Do I look like a fucking tool to you?

1434
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:50,291
Don't say anything, Allan. We can jail.

1435
01:01:50,305 --> 01:01:51,774
No, we cannot jail.

1436
01:01:51,807 --> 01:01:53,242
We can. It ain't no thing, brother.

1437
01:01:53,442 --> 01:01:54,877
Please, I, I need a lawyer.

1438
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:57,780
Okay, now, it's okay. Walk with me.

1439
01:01:57,813 --> 01:01:59,925
Hey, stand up, buddy. Come on, come on.

1440
01:02:00,195 --> 01:02:02,918
So I just want you guys to know,
I'm totally cool.

1441
01:02:03,118 --> 01:02:04,253
You guys holding?

1442
01:02:04,286 --> 01:02:05,455
- No.
- No?

1443
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:08,322
Look, it's okay. I'm, I'm looking to party.

1444
01:02:08,681 --> 01:02:11,126
I don't understand what's
going on right now.

1445
01:02:11,326 --> 01:02:13,862
This whole badge thing,
it's actually just a paycheck.

1446
01:02:14,062 --> 01:02:15,798
I'm actually writing a children's book.

1447
01:02:15,831 --> 01:02:18,300
It's about human body parts.
It's a pop-up book.

1448
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,270
- Oh, oh, hello, what's this?
- I can explain what that is.

1449
01:02:21,303 --> 01:02:22,271
It's a multivitamin.

1450
01:02:22,304 --> 01:02:24,206
It's<i> gingko biloba.</i> It's for old people.

1451
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:25,239
Really?

1452
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:28,644
Did you just put that in your mouth?

1453
01:02:28,844 --> 01:02:30,146
Oh, this is awesome.

1454
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:32,624
Totally not cool,
you guys holding out on me.

1455
01:02:33,315 --> 01:02:34,416
Wow.

1456
01:02:34,449 --> 01:02:35,484
So, listen, I mean,

1457
01:02:35,517 --> 01:02:38,053
unless it's illegal to
have herbal supplements,

1458
01:02:38,086 --> 01:02:39,087
we could probably go, right?

1459
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:41,824
Yeah,
or I could probably shoot you right now

1460
01:02:41,857 --> 01:02:43,802
and I could grudge fuck your scalps.

1461
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:47,062
I'm kidding, I was just... Lighten up.

1462
01:02:47,095 --> 01:02:50,066
So I'm gonna actually have
to confiscate your stash.

1463
01:02:50,499 --> 01:02:52,401
And, uh, I called this in,

1464
01:02:52,434 --> 01:02:54,403
so I'm gonna have to turn
you over to an adult.

1465
01:02:54,436 --> 01:02:55,936
Who do you want me to call?

1466
01:03:00,475 --> 01:03:02,779
Ah, I'll take it from here, officer.

1467
01:03:03,058 --> 01:03:05,447
The next time I catch
you two running around

1468
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,647
hopped up on elderly vitamins
in my district, you're done.

1469
01:03:08,847 --> 01:03:10,052
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir.

1470
01:03:10,085 --> 01:03:12,288
Get in the bus. Now.

1471
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:13,710
What if we don't want to?

1472
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:15,223
It wasn't a question.

1473
01:03:21,163 --> 01:03:22,497
They're virgins. It's...

1474
01:03:23,423 --> 01:03:25,201
Allan, we need to go. The bus...

1475
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:26,602
Is it because I lied to my mother?

1476
01:03:26,635 --> 01:03:28,571
- What?
- I lied about going on a trip.

1477
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:30,172
Now we're going on a camping trip.

1478
01:03:30,205 --> 01:03:31,574
This is how it works with mothers.

1479
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:32,675
It's the law of the universe.

1480
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:35,377
I don't know how it happens.
There's no explanations.

1481
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:37,980
Did you forget that your mother
is at home banging a hobo?

1482
01:03:38,013 --> 01:03:39,453
Will you stop it with the hobo thing?

1483
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:41,483
I've asked you so many times to stop that.

1484
01:03:41,516 --> 01:03:43,920
It's what she's doing, banging a hobo.

1485
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:45,387
Unh.

1486
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,032
- Hey, Allan.
- Hey, Brittany.

1487
01:03:47,232 --> 01:03:49,158
- Everything all right?
- More or less.

1488
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:51,994
Allan, seriously,
we need to get off the bus right now.

1489
01:03:52,194 --> 01:03:53,295
I still have the Bliss.

1490
01:03:53,328 --> 01:03:54,897
- Where?
- I suitcased it.

1491
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:56,933
You stuck it up your ass?

1492
01:03:58,267 --> 01:03:59,268
What's up?

1493
01:04:00,669 --> 01:04:03,639
Boss man, I'm gonna get out of here.
Off the bus.

1494
01:04:03,672 --> 01:04:04,773
Where do you think you're going?

1495
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:07,476
I just said I'm gonna get off...
I gotta get... No, God.

1496
01:04:07,676 --> 01:04:10,145
There's been a huge misunderstanding here.

1497
01:04:10,178 --> 01:04:12,147
There's been no
misunderstanding, young man.

1498
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:15,150
I informed the peace officer
that I'm responsible for you.

1499
01:04:15,183 --> 01:04:17,453
- We're gay.
- Excuse me?

1500
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:18,888
- You and I...
- No.

1501
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:20,322
- This guy, we're gay.
- No, no.

1502
01:04:20,355 --> 01:04:22,324
We're always super gay, all the time, 24/7.

1503
01:04:22,357 --> 01:04:24,560
He's just making up stuff
because he wants to get off.

1504
01:04:24,593 --> 01:04:25,961
It's not true.

1505
01:04:25,994 --> 01:04:27,594
The other night, he showed me his penis.

1506
01:04:27,596 --> 01:04:29,932
What? No, no, you looked at my penis.

1507
01:04:29,965 --> 01:04:32,268
It's okay, I've known for a long time.

1508
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:34,136
As long as you keep your hands to yourself,

1509
01:04:34,169 --> 01:04:36,071
and don't have any "hidden agendas,"

1510
01:04:36,271 --> 01:04:38,340
you're more than welcome
to join us this weekend.

1511
01:04:38,373 --> 01:04:40,242
My fervent hope is that this weekend

1512
01:04:40,275 --> 01:04:42,044
will be a transformational one for you.

1513
01:04:42,077 --> 01:04:44,146
No, no, excuse me.
I don't need to be transformed.

1514
01:04:44,179 --> 01:04:46,315
- I'm not gay. No, I'm not.
- Because we're gay.

1515
01:04:46,348 --> 01:04:48,737
- Because we're gay.
- You're not listening.

1516
01:04:50,552 --> 01:04:52,321
- Mango, mango!
- Mango.

1517
01:04:52,354 --> 01:04:55,024
Gentlemen, this is completely unacceptable.

1518
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,125
I'm a lesbian.

1519
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:58,694
I've known since I was 6
when I tongue-kissed Joanne.

1520
01:04:58,727 --> 01:05:00,663
- Brittany, sit...
- Mango!

1521
01:05:01,229 --> 01:05:02,698
- Sit down.
- I'm gay.

1522
01:05:02,731 --> 01:05:04,300
Brian, goddamn it.

1523
01:05:05,033 --> 01:05:07,470
- Mango.
- Oh, my God.

1524
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:10,139
- Mango.
- Mango.

1525
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:12,374
Oh, this is happening right now.

1526
01:05:12,407 --> 01:05:15,611
Mango, mango, mango.

1527
01:05:15,644 --> 01:05:17,346
Mango, mango, mango.

1528
01:05:23,218 --> 01:05:25,187
Thanks for being gay, Allan.

1529
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:27,089
Oh, it's cool to be gay, Brittany,

1530
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:29,125
if you are, but I'm not.

1531
01:05:29,591 --> 01:05:30,993
I'm not gay.

1532
01:05:36,264 --> 01:05:37,653
Why were we saying mango?

1533
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,678
That was our safe word.

1534
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:41,437
The one that I thought
we've agreed upon to say

1535
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:42,571
when one of us were feeling uncomfortable.

1536
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:45,507
You're right, I'm sorry, dude.
I'm totally sorry, okay?

1537
01:05:45,707 --> 01:05:48,143
Dude,
you're gonna thank me for this someday.

1538
01:05:48,343 --> 01:05:49,955
I'm gonna thank you for this?

1539
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:51,413
Do you mean the someday

1540
01:05:51,446 --> 01:05:53,015
after I graduated from high school,

1541
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:54,416
which for the last year and a half

1542
01:05:54,449 --> 01:05:56,251
I will spend outed as gay?

1543
01:05:56,284 --> 01:05:58,654
Which would be fine if I was, but I'm not.

1544
01:05:59,245 --> 01:06:01,690
Is that the someday that
you're referring to?

1545
01:06:01,723 --> 01:06:03,025
Yes.

1546
01:06:03,058 --> 01:06:05,461
What is done is done, son. Okay?

1547
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:07,496
Are you serious?

1548
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:10,399
Are you serious right now?
Is that all you could say?

1549
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:13,102
No. I can actually tell
you one other thing.

1550
01:06:14,703 --> 01:06:16,592
All due respect, between you and I,

1551
01:06:16,792 --> 01:06:19,408
you're gonna have to bring
your A-game to the twins, okay?

1552
01:06:19,441 --> 01:06:21,553
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1553
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:23,312
Girls like a good kisser.

1554
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,181
And you are just all teeth, man.

1555
01:06:26,214 --> 01:06:28,450
If you threw some tongue in the mix.
If you mix it up...

1556
01:06:28,483 --> 01:06:30,052
You don't think I'm a good kisser.

1557
01:06:30,085 --> 01:06:31,286
No. You're decent.

1558
01:06:31,319 --> 01:06:33,589
- You forced yourself on me.
- Stop, stop.

1559
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:36,158
Okay, stop.
You're here, let's bring it here, goal.

1560
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:37,193
But...

1561
01:06:40,662 --> 01:06:42,496
I got the Bliss. All that matters.

1562
01:06:45,367 --> 01:06:47,645
Oh, we're gonna need another bag for that.

1563
01:06:47,845 --> 01:06:50,138
Do you think that for once
you cannot slam the door?

1564
01:06:50,338 --> 01:06:52,341
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did, you always do.

1565
01:06:52,374 --> 01:06:54,076
Okay, I will not slam the door.

1566
01:06:54,109 --> 01:06:55,811
If you break something,
you're paying for it.

1567
01:06:55,844 --> 01:06:58,714
Because, thanks to you,
my Volvo fund is out the window.

1568
01:06:58,747 --> 01:07:00,049
Dude, it is a car.

1569
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:01,317
Shit does not just break.

1570
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:04,684
Yes, it does break,
especially if you keep slamming the door.

1571
01:07:05,153 --> 01:07:07,456
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no.

1572
01:07:07,489 --> 01:07:08,724
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, don't.

1573
01:07:08,757 --> 01:07:10,493
No, no, no.

1574
01:07:11,226 --> 01:07:12,728
- Go.
- God.

1575
01:07:12,761 --> 01:07:13,763
Damn it.

1576
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:17,166
That was fucking awesome.

1577
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,801
That was awesome?

1578
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:20,169
That was awesome?

1579
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,137
Do you have any idea how much time

1580
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:24,337
and how much money I have put into this?

1581
01:07:24,739 --> 01:07:26,141
They violated my Volvo.

1582
01:07:26,174 --> 01:07:27,176
It's a mirror.

1583
01:07:32,647 --> 01:07:35,484
Okay. Allan, you need to relax.

1584
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:37,786
You're completely losing
sight of the big picture.

1585
01:07:37,819 --> 01:07:40,389
I can't do this anymore.
This is way too much.

1586
01:07:40,422 --> 01:07:42,792
- Dude, please, get out.
- Seriously?

1587
01:07:47,262 --> 01:07:48,264
What the hell.

1588
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:02,778
It's not about the Volvo, Allan.

1589
01:08:02,811 --> 01:08:06,281
It is about you seriously
needing to grow a pair of balls.

1590
01:08:06,314 --> 01:08:07,883
I might talk a lot of bullshit

1591
01:08:07,916 --> 01:08:09,351
but at least I get shit done.

1592
01:08:09,384 --> 01:08:10,864
Friends are supposed to be there for...

1593
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:12,287
No, friends are not supposed

1594
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,840
to get them almost killed by gangsters.

1595
01:08:13,855 --> 01:08:15,657
Or out them to the whole school.

1596
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:16,791
If it wasn't for me,

1597
01:08:16,825 --> 01:08:19,128
you'd be camping with a
bunch of virgins right now.

1598
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:21,130
At least I'm not some burned out loser

1599
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:22,831
whose only contribution to society

1600
01:08:22,864 --> 01:08:25,864
is to pretend like you're
some ghetto-blasted gangster.

1601
01:08:26,064 --> 01:08:28,237
A topic which he obviously
knows nothing about.

1602
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,873
You know why? Because you don't
have a father, that's why.

1603
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:34,110
Ow, Allan. Ouch, okay?

1604
01:08:34,476 --> 01:08:37,412
You know what?
I want my thunderpants back tomorrow.

1605
01:08:37,445 --> 01:08:39,681
You put them on my mailbox
because we are done talking.

1606
01:08:39,714 --> 01:08:42,851
I will leave them on your front door,
my friend.

1607
01:08:42,884 --> 01:08:45,320
Oh, excuse me, I forgot,
your front door is a couch

1608
01:08:45,353 --> 01:08:47,289
because you're too freaking stupid to know

1609
01:08:47,322 --> 01:08:49,224
that it doesn't go in that way.

1610
01:08:49,257 --> 01:08:50,292
Wow.

1611
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:52,261
Okay. You know what?

1612
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:55,331
I want my thunderpants back right now,
motherfucker.

1613
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:26,195
<i>I just want to let you know
that I wish you were here.</i>

1614
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:27,948
<i>And if you decide to
never talk to me again,</i>

1615
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:30,199
<i>I l want you to still keep
the elephant underwear</i>

1616
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:31,400
<i>to remember me by.</i>

1617
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:33,593
<i>Oh, and, Madeline said she
wants to touch your penis.</i>

1618
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:35,270
<i>Her words not mine. Okay, bye.</i>

1619
01:09:35,303 --> 01:09:36,915
Hey, what are you doing here?

1620
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,475
Uh, hi. Um, my name is Joe Smith.

1621
01:09:40,508 --> 01:09:42,244
I'm just wondering if Allan was here

1622
01:09:42,277 --> 01:09:43,645
so we could hang out or something.

1623
01:09:43,678 --> 01:09:45,213
It's nice to meet you, Allan.

1624
01:09:45,413 --> 01:09:47,302
I'm Ted, a friend of your mother's.

1625
01:09:47,916 --> 01:09:51,220
We're, um, how do you young guys say it,
uh, fuck buddies.

1626
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:53,922
No. I don't say that like ever.

1627
01:09:53,955 --> 01:09:54,957
Hey.

1628
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:57,347
I care about your mother, okay?

1629
01:09:57,659 --> 01:10:00,929
Do you want like a towel
or something or like pants?

1630
01:10:00,962 --> 01:10:03,632
I like to air dry.
You know, to go au naturel.

1631
01:10:03,665 --> 01:10:05,234
You know what I mean? You feel me?

1632
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:06,934
No, I don't. I don't feel you.

1633
01:10:10,672 --> 01:10:12,061
' "I wish you were here."

1634
01:10:14,342 --> 01:10:15,811
- Yahoo.
- Oh, no.

1635
01:10:16,544 --> 01:10:18,314
Oh, no. Oh, no, Kenny and Evan.

1636
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:19,969
Oh, my God. I have to go.

1637
01:10:20,949 --> 01:10:23,685
This never happened. We never met, ever.

1638
01:10:23,718 --> 01:10:24,787
I gotta save Zack.

1639
01:10:33,528 --> 01:10:36,232
Okay, we're good. It's not but...

1640
01:10:36,477 --> 01:10:37,866
We're good. Phone's dead.

1641
01:10:38,066 --> 01:10:40,011
- Love to do this.
- Yeah, be quick.

1642
01:10:40,368 --> 01:10:42,868
- What are we waiting for?
- Oh, what's wrong?

1643
01:10:43,429 --> 01:10:45,707
- Nothing.
- Why don't you call him again?

1644
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,643
- You can use the phone.
- No, I don't want...

1645
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:49,444
No, let's just... Let's just do it.

1646
01:10:49,477 --> 01:10:50,712
Did you guys got into a fight?

1647
01:10:50,745 --> 01:10:52,848
No, he just freaked out a little bit.

1648
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:53,882
He's a super nice guy,

1649
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,719
and you guys kind of like scare him,
you know?

1650
01:10:57,209 --> 01:10:59,821
- But maybe he's gay.
- And that's totally cool.

1651
01:10:59,854 --> 01:11:02,021
Yeah, because being gay is totally fine.

1652
01:11:02,247 --> 01:11:04,359
If you are. But he's not, he's not gay.

1653
01:11:04,392 --> 01:11:06,295
Yeah, he's just really uptight.

1654
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:08,631
Otherwise, he's a super, super cool guy.

1655
01:11:09,831 --> 01:11:12,220
I wish he was in front
of me just right now.

1656
01:11:12,767 --> 01:11:14,503
- Okay, let's...
- Party.

1657
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:16,405
And now...

1658
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,040
And now we can kick your Lambachan ass.

1659
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:19,275
Shit.

1660
01:11:19,976 --> 01:11:21,476
- No, no, no.
- You're dead.

1661
01:11:21,509 --> 01:11:23,845
- Leave him alone.
- You can't just barge in here.

1662
01:11:23,878 --> 01:11:24,880
Shut the fuck up.

1663
01:11:25,413 --> 01:11:27,950
Man, we can talk about this.

1664
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:30,286
Where's he going?

1665
01:11:31,653 --> 01:11:33,388
Ow. Ow.

1666
01:11:33,421 --> 01:11:34,823
What the hell are you wearing?

1667
01:11:34,856 --> 01:11:35,991
Why, do you like it?

1668
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,793
I can get you one if you want.

1669
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:39,660
Maybe like a rooster or a penguin?

1670
01:11:40,495 --> 01:11:42,497
- Stop, stop.
- I hate you, stop it.

1671
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:43,932
Okay, all right. Okay.

1672
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:46,401
- Ah!
- No snappy comebacks, huh?

1673
01:11:46,434 --> 01:11:47,402
You want a comeback?

1674
01:11:47,435 --> 01:11:49,880
You have to scrape me
from your mama's mouth.

1675
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:55,311
What the hell?

1676
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:58,447
What the fuck is that?

1677
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:01,350
Uh, isn't that the bumper of your car?

1678
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,752
That isn't my car. It's my mom's car, man.

1679
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:05,887
- She's gonna kill me.
- Hell, yeah.

1680
01:12:06,087 --> 01:12:09,391
Stupid pieces of shit, let's do this.

1681
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:11,059
I said let's fucking do this.

1682
01:12:11,092 --> 01:12:12,661
It's prison rules, motherfucker.

1683
01:12:12,694 --> 01:12:13,795
Come on, hit me.

1684
01:12:13,828 --> 01:12:15,108
What did you do to my mom's car?

1685
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:17,599
Fuck your mom's car,
you stupid motherfucker,

1686
01:12:17,632 --> 01:12:19,601
with my fucking Volvo.

1687
01:12:23,606 --> 01:12:24,773
You're fucking crazy.

1688
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:27,909
I'm fucking crazy?
I'll show you fucking crazy.

1689
01:12:27,942 --> 01:12:30,545
I'm gonna play your ass
like fucking tether ball.

1690
01:12:30,745 --> 01:12:32,781
From now on, I'm gonna park my Volvo

1691
01:12:32,814 --> 01:12:34,449
wherever the fuck I want,

1692
01:12:34,482 --> 01:12:37,386
whenever the fuck I want,
is that understood?

1693
01:12:37,943 --> 01:12:39,721
- You think so, huh, boy?
- Sh...

1694
01:12:39,921 --> 01:12:41,755
My boy Allan asked you a question.

1695
01:12:42,056 --> 01:12:43,359
Why don't you answer?

1696
01:12:43,725 --> 01:12:44,860
Mr. Allan,

1697
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:47,227
whatever you say, buddy, sounds good to me.

1698
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:49,307
I'm glad we could clear that up.

1699
01:12:49,697 --> 01:12:50,699
Get lost.

1700
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,638
- Thanks, Larry.
- My pleasure, kid.

1701
01:12:56,971 --> 01:13:00,442
See you Thursday after school.
Full landscaping consultation.

1702
01:13:00,475 --> 01:13:02,809
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely, we'll be there.

1703
01:13:03,144 --> 01:13:04,646
Ladies, stay off the pole.

1704
01:13:07,215 --> 01:13:09,084
Allan, that was amazing, man.

1705
01:13:09,117 --> 01:13:11,553
You seriously connected
with your inner badass.

1706
01:13:11,586 --> 01:13:13,788
That had to be the coolest
thing I've seen in my life.

1707
01:13:13,988 --> 01:13:16,211
Dude, I'm sorry about everything, like...

1708
01:13:16,527 --> 01:13:19,027
- I'm sorry too.
- It's all good, brother man.

1709
01:13:19,227 --> 01:13:22,564
Most important thing is
we're finally back together.

1710
01:13:23,765 --> 01:13:24,767
Friends?

1711
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:27,936
Yeah, friends. Ha, ha.

1712
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:29,837
- Come here.
- Ha, ha.

1713
01:13:31,218 --> 01:13:32,774
Ladies, what did I tell you?

1714
01:13:32,807 --> 01:13:34,543
He just needs to loosen up a bit, right?

1715
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:36,078
That was amazing. Ha, ha.

1716
01:13:36,644 --> 01:13:37,946
Oh, you know, I try.

1717
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:38,947
Oh, excuse me,

1718
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:41,016
I think there's some
business to take care of

1719
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:42,217
with a thing called Bliss.

1720
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:43,452
Hmm.

1721
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,023
No! Fuck me.

1722
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:50,058
Shit! You know what? This is okay.

1723
01:13:50,091 --> 01:13:51,593
We can just go get some more.

1724
01:13:51,626 --> 01:13:53,126
No. No, we cannot get more.

1725
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:57,499
You know, just because the Bliss is gone,

1726
01:13:57,532 --> 01:13:59,201
does not mean you have to leave.

1727
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:02,070
- We don't? Really?
- Not unless you guys want to.

1728
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:09,177
Ladies, will you actually give us

1729
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:10,710
just a really quick second?

1730
01:14:11,045 --> 01:14:13,048
- Sure thing.
- We'll be right back.

1731
01:14:13,948 --> 01:14:15,784
Go, go, go.

1732
01:14:16,518 --> 01:14:18,296
We've got a fucking problem, man.

1733
01:14:20,655 --> 01:14:22,090
Okay. All right, listen.

1734
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:24,993
I was thinking we use Bliss
to kind of loosen things up,

1735
01:14:25,026 --> 01:14:27,128
so let's just go back to
the club for a second.

1736
01:14:27,161 --> 01:14:29,965
No, Zack, we could not go back. We can't.

1737
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:31,066
I'm nervous.

1738
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:35,003
What? You? You're nervous?

1739
01:14:36,037 --> 01:14:37,272
Man, come on. Come on.

1740
01:14:37,305 --> 01:14:39,508
What about all those chicks you got with,
man?

1741
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:41,643
What about your pubic hair teeth beard?

1742
01:14:41,843 --> 01:14:44,246
I kind of made all that up, so...

1743
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:46,181
So you've never been with a girl before?

1744
01:14:46,214 --> 01:14:47,849
No, that's not what I'm saying.

1745
01:14:47,882 --> 01:14:51,920
I've definitely been with a girl. Once.

1746
01:14:51,953 --> 01:14:53,054
And I was really drunk,

1747
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:55,087
and she kind of forced herself on me.

1748
01:14:55,423 --> 01:14:57,526
Then she broke up with me the next day.

1749
01:14:57,559 --> 01:14:59,194
Why would you make up stories like that?

1750
01:14:59,227 --> 01:15:00,162
When I came here,

1751
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:03,532
I decided I'm gonna be
the cool, badass dude

1752
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:05,500
who just fucks a lot of chicks, man.

1753
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:07,020
So if you want to be the cool kid

1754
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:08,904
why would you hang out
with a loser like me?

1755
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:10,382
Dude, you are not a loser.

1756
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,574
And you are good with who you are.

1757
01:15:12,607 --> 01:15:13,708
No.

1758
01:15:13,741 --> 01:15:15,710
I mean, I'm like an old person

1759
01:15:15,743 --> 01:15:17,846
who's stuck in a 17 year old's body.

1760
01:15:17,879 --> 01:15:20,015
- I drive a pink Volvo.
- No, it's salmon.

1761
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:21,917
No, fuck that. It's pink, man.

1762
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:23,918
Look, I admit, I need to get out more.

1763
01:15:24,118 --> 01:15:26,007
I need to get out with you tonight.

1764
01:15:27,002 --> 01:15:30,225
Okay, maybe not like tonight.
But you know what I'm saying.

1765
01:15:30,258 --> 01:15:31,726
Come on, boys.

1766
01:15:31,759 --> 01:15:33,537
Yeah, come show us what you got.

1767
01:15:33,995 --> 01:15:35,864
Okay, seriously, I can't do this.

1768
01:15:35,897 --> 01:15:38,600
You're just experiencing some
minor performance anxiety.

1769
01:15:38,633 --> 01:15:41,236
- I get that, but it's...
- Close your eyes.

1770
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:45,307
Think of the hottest thing you've ever seen

1771
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,542
in your entire life.

1772
01:15:47,143 --> 01:15:49,077
- Okay, your mom fucking that...
- Okay, stop.

1773
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:50,333
- Open your eyes.
- So?

1774
01:15:53,348 --> 01:15:54,550
Let's just do this.

1775
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:55,984
Seriously?

1776
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:58,320
Yeah, seriously.

1777
01:15:59,687 --> 01:16:00,689
Come on.

1778
01:16:03,257 --> 01:16:04,259
Okay.

1779
01:16:04,792 --> 01:16:06,070
Do we have a safe word?

1780
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:08,406
Actually, you know, it's funny...

1781
01:16:08,696 --> 01:16:09,931
No.

1782
01:16:09,964 --> 01:16:11,933
Fuck that. Fuck safe words.

1783
01:16:11,966 --> 01:16:13,966
We'll just fake it until you make it?

1784
01:17:02,585 --> 01:17:04,919
- You want the kiss?
- Yeah, you like this?

1785
01:17:04,952 --> 01:17:06,888
You guys wanna go with that?

1786
01:17:06,921 --> 01:17:08,356
Are we really gonna do this?

1787
01:17:08,389 --> 01:17:09,725
- I guess.
- Ha, ha.

1788
01:17:11,025 --> 01:17:12,025
Okay.

1789
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:15,831
- You guys first.
- Yeah, let's see.

1790
01:17:21,969 --> 01:17:24,239
Come on, Zack. Harder, harder, Zack.

1791
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:26,241
Push harder. Oh, God.

1792
01:17:26,588 --> 01:17:29,144
Almost got it.
Just pull a little to your left.

1793
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:31,046
- Oh, God.
- Oh, yeah.

1794
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:33,915
Okay, here it comes. Pull out, pull out.

1795
01:17:33,948 --> 01:17:35,283
Oh, we got it.

1796
01:17:35,316 --> 01:17:36,885
Here it comes. There we go.

1797
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:45,469
That was the best night of my entire life.

1798
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:48,397
Yeah. Me too.

1799
01:17:51,866 --> 01:17:53,589
So what do we do with tomorrow?

1800
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:14,322
- Allan, we need to talk.
- Mom, will you knock?

1801
01:18:14,355 --> 01:18:16,091
- Can you please wait...?
- Honey, honey.

1802
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:17,859
I have to get this out, honey.

1803
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:20,627
- I have a boyfriend.
- Ted.

1804
01:18:21,295 --> 01:18:22,964
Yeah. How did you know?

1805
01:18:22,997 --> 01:18:26,301
Mom, I totally totally get it.
You deserve some you time.

1806
01:18:26,834 --> 01:18:29,104
Hey, why are you even here?

1807
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:30,872
You're supposed to be on a camping trip.

1808
01:18:30,905 --> 01:18:32,017
I didn't go camping.

1809
01:18:32,587 --> 01:18:34,976
I took down the base
boys of my high school.

1810
01:18:35,009 --> 01:18:36,676
I got a job with a Mafia boss.

1811
01:18:37,278 --> 01:18:39,056
And I lost my virginity to twins.

1812
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:40,815
Girl twins.

1813
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:44,152
What?

1814
01:18:44,452 --> 01:18:45,620
What's so funny?

1815
01:18:45,653 --> 01:18:48,256
- You're making fun of me.
- No, I'm not. I'm dead serious.

1816
01:18:48,289 --> 01:18:50,792
Okay. I know, honey.

1817
01:18:50,825 --> 01:18:54,162
I know I can be
overprotective and suspicious.

1818
01:18:54,195 --> 01:18:56,140
But I trust you. I really trust you.

1819
01:18:56,464 --> 01:18:57,466
I trust you too.

1820
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:00,202
You're a good kid.

1821
01:19:02,036 --> 01:19:03,038
Mafia.

1822
01:19:03,538 --> 01:19:05,774
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

1823
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:07,209
- Waffles?
- Yes, please.

1824
01:19:43,444 --> 01:19:44,446
Mango.

1825
01:19:52,587 --> 01:19:55,523
You know, we should actually
go to like a club this weekend.

1826
01:19:55,556 --> 01:19:56,834
You can get into clubs?

1827
01:19:57,493 --> 01:19:59,893
Are you kidding me?
We get into clubs all the time.

1828
01:19:59,994 --> 01:20:03,398
Actually, we don't.
No clubs, nothing like that, no.

1829
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:04,487
No. Yeah, we don't.

1830
01:20:05,166 --> 01:20:06,944
We actually don't get into clubs.

1831
01:21:03,357 --> 01:21:07,028
Yeah, hi. Uh,
you guys are located on the Strip, correct?

1832
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:10,598
No, I wanna be in the heart of Vegas,
know what I'm saying?

1833
01:21:10,631 --> 01:21:12,333
I'm looking for like the biggest suite.

1834
01:21:12,366 --> 01:21:14,469
So if we could get one
with the name penthouse

1835
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:16,404
and that'd be fantastic.

1836
01:21:17,004 --> 01:21:18,039
Quick questions.

1837
01:21:18,072 --> 01:21:20,976
Uh, first of all, uh,
how's the sound in the room?

1838
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:23,111
I'm hoping for a little extra padding.

1839
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:26,314
There's gonna be a lot of
sexual intercourse going on.

1840
01:21:26,347 --> 01:21:29,050
Public intoxication, that's okay?
Okay, cool.

1841
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:31,219
How about naked intoxication?

1842
01:21:31,252 --> 01:21:34,586
Because I'm planning on swinging
my thing around quite a bit.

1843
01:21:35,022 --> 01:21:38,026
Oh, yeah, also,
do you have a masseuse on call?

1844
01:21:39,627 --> 01:21:41,029
Awesome.

1845
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:42,562
Do they give happy endings?

1846
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:45,533
Yeah, let me... Let me snag it up for you.

1847
01:21:46,634 --> 01:21:49,537
All right,
the name on the card is Allan Wright.

1848
01:21:50,671 --> 01:21:52,340
And the number is...
