1
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:03,585
Ok, on your toes, men.

2
00:01:03,653 --> 00:01:05,678
Hi-ho, Silver!

3
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:08,485
Hey, we got to save Olive Oyl!

4
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:46,208
Hail, Rome!

5
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,219
Victorious...
in thy mourning weeds!

6
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,915
Lo, as the bark that hath
discharged her freight

7
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,618
returns with precious lading
to the bay

8
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:01,160
from whence at first
she weighed her anchorage,

9
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:05,164
cometh Andronicus,
bound with laurel boughs,

10
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:08,531
to re-salute his country
with his tears.

11
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,733
Stand gracious to the rites
that we intend!

12
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:18,972
Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons

13
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:23,813
behold the poor remains,
alive and dead.

14
00:07:23,884 --> 00:07:28,583
These that survive,
let Rome reward with love.

15
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,318
These that I bring
unto their latest home

16
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:34,657
with burial amongst their ancestors.

17
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:38,892
Here Goths have given me leave
to sheathe my sword.

18
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:50,639
Titus, unkind and careless
of thine own,

19
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:55,011
why suffer'st thou thy sons,
unburied yet,

20
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:58,813
to hover on
the dreadful shore of Styx?

21
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:10,526
Make way to lay them
by their brethren!

22
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:32,741
O sacred receptacle of my joys,

23
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:38,115
sweet cell of virtue and nobility,

24
00:09:38,185 --> 00:09:41,712
how many sons of mine
hast thou in store

25
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,417
that thou wilt never
render to me more?

26
00:10:08,415 --> 00:10:12,078
And there greet in silence,
as the dead are wont,

27
00:10:12,152 --> 00:10:17,089
and sleep in peace,
slain in your country's wars.

28
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:31,561
Give us the proudest prisoner
of the Goths

29
00:10:31,638 --> 00:10:34,471
that we may hew his limbs,
and on a pile...

30
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,532
Admanes fratrum.

31
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,339
sacrifice his flesh.

32
00:10:38,412 --> 00:10:40,573
That so the shadows
be not unappeased,

33
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:43,047
nor we disturbed
with prodigies on earth.

34
00:10:43,117 --> 00:10:46,951
I give him you,
the noblest that survives:

35
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,251
the eldest son of
this distressed queen.

36
00:10:50,324 --> 00:10:54,317
No! Stay, Roman brethren!

37
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:55,952
Gracious conqueror,

38
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:00,898
victorious Titus,
rue the tears I shed--

39
00:11:00,968 --> 00:11:03,698
the mother's tears
in passion for her son.

40
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,601
No!

41
00:11:05,672 --> 00:11:08,072
If thy sons were ever dear to thee,

42
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:10,042
oh, think my son to be
as dear to me.

43
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,604
Sufficeth not that
we are brought to Rome

44
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:17,650
to beautify your triumphs and return,

45
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,913
captive to thee and thy Roman yoke?

46
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:25,391
But must my sons be slaughtered
in the streets

47
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:28,428
for valiant doings
in their country's cause?

48
00:11:28,495 --> 00:11:31,953
Oh, if to fight for king and commonweal
were piety in thine,

49
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:33,260
it is in these.

50
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:36,730
Andronicus...

51
00:11:36,803 --> 00:11:40,796
stain not thy tomb with blood.

52
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:44,776
Wilt thou draw near
the nature of the gods?

53
00:11:44,845 --> 00:11:47,643
Draw near them then
in being merciful.

54
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:52,845
Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge.

55
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,514
Thrice noble Titus...

56
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:01,484
spare my born-born son.

57
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:04,929
Patient yourself,
madam, and pardon me.

58
00:12:04,998 --> 00:12:07,899
These are their brethren,
whom your Goths beheld

59
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:09,492
alive and dead,

60
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,435
and for their brethren slain,

61
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:13,973
religiously they ask a sacrifice.

62
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,703
To this your son is marked...

63
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:20,340
and die he must
to appease their groaning shadows

64
00:12:20,414 --> 00:12:21,972
that are gone.

65
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:25,212
Away with him
and make a fire straight.

66
00:12:25,285 --> 00:12:27,719
And with our swords,
upon a pile of wood

67
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,519
let's hew his limbs
till they be clean consumed.

68
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:38,122
O cruel, irreligious piety!

69
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:40,530
Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?

70
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:42,967
Oppose not Scythia
to ambitious Rome.

71
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:45,470
Alarbus goes to rest,

72
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:48,997
and we survive to tremble
under Titus' threatening looks.

73
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:54,414
Stand resolved...

74
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:57,314
but hope withal
the gods may favor Tamora,

75
00:12:57,384 --> 00:12:59,284
the queen of Goths,

76
00:12:59,353 --> 00:13:02,550
to quit these bloody wrongs
upon her foes.

77
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,602
See, lord and Father,

78
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,228
how we have performed
our Roman rites!

79
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:19,863
Alarbus' limbs are lopped,

80
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,067
and entrails feed
the sacrificing fire.

81
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:25,720
Remaineth not,
but to inter our brethren

82
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:28,484
and with loud alarums
welcome them to Rome.

83
00:14:01,157 --> 00:14:05,150
I n peace and honor
rest you here, my sons,

84
00:14:05,228 --> 00:14:09,824
secure from worldly chances and mishaps.

85
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:16,763
Here lurks no treason.

86
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,275
Here no envy swells.

87
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:23,540
Here grow no damned drugs.

88
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,912
Here are no storms,

89
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:29,178
no noise...

90
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:32,187
but silence and eternal sleep.

91
00:14:34,557 --> 00:14:37,492
I n peace and honor
rest you here, my sons.

92
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,018
I n peace and honor
live Lord Titus long.

93
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:45,727
My noble lord and father,
live in fame.

94
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:51,771
Lo, at this tomb
my tributary tears I render

95
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:54,207
for my brethren's obsequies.

96
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:59,943
And at thy feet I kneel,
with tears of joy

97
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:03,076
shed on the earth
for thy return to Rome.

98
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,457
Bless me here with
thy victorious hand.

99
00:15:10,193 --> 00:15:13,060
Kind Rome,
that hast thus lovingly reserved

100
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:15,927
the cordial of mine age
to glad my heart.

101
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:20,602
Lavinia, live.

102
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:27,075
Outlive thy father's days
and fame's eternal date,

103
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:29,407
for virtue's praise.

104
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:17,718
Noble patricians,
patrons of my right,

105
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:22,696
defend the justice
of my cause with arms!

106
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:26,496
And, countrymen,
my loving followers,

107
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:30,937
plead my successive title
with your swords!

108
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:35,443
Romans, friends, followers,
favorers of my right,

109
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:38,344
if ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,

110
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,575
were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,

111
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:44,449
keep, then,
this passage to the capitol!

112
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,387
I am the born-born son!

113
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:52,052
That was the last that wear
the imperial diadem of Rome.

114
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:55,756
And suffer not dishonor
to approach the imperial seat:

115
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:58,595
to virtue, consecrate...

116
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:02,626
to justice, continence, and nobility!

117
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:06,471
Then let my father's honors live in me!

118
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:10,876
Nor wrong mine age
with this indignity!

119
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:14,848
But let desert
in pure election shine,

120
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:18,546
and, Romans,
fight for freedom in your choice.

121
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:08,264
Princes...

122
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:12,137
that strive by factions
and by friends ambitiously

123
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:14,004
for rule and empery!

124
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:18,012
Know that the people of Rome
have by common voice

125
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,447
in elections for the Roman empery
chosen Andronicus.

126
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,542
A nobler man,

127
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:27,350
a braver warrior, lives not this day
within the city walls.

128
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:31,154
He by the Senate is
accited home from weary wars

129
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:32,750
against the barbarous Goths.

130
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:36,696
Let us entreat,
by honor of his name,

131
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:40,201
that you withdraw you,
dismiss your followers,

132
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:44,069
and, as suitors should,
plead your deserts in peace

133
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:45,902
and humbleness.

134
00:18:45,974 --> 00:18:47,669
Marcus Andronicus...

135
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:56,343
so I do rely on thy uprightness
and integrity,

136
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:59,353
and so I love and honor
thee and thine--

137
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:02,913
thy noble brother Titus and his sons

138
00:19:02,991 --> 00:19:06,620
and her to whom
my thoughts are humbled all,

139
00:19:06,695 --> 00:19:10,722
gracious Lavinia,
Rome's rich ornament--

140
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,427
that I will here dismiss
my loving friends.

141
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:20,438
And to my fortunes
and the people's favor,

142
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:25,344
commit my cause
in balance to be weighed.

143
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:38,454
Friends...

144
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:43,123
that have been thus forward
in my right,

145
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:47,567
I thank you all
and here dismiss you all.

146
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:51,936
And to the love and favor of my country

147
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:56,706
commit myself, my person,

148
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,769
and the cause!

149
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:06,314
Rome...

150
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:09,551
be as just and gracious unto me

151
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,321
as I am confident and kind to thee.

152
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:15,329
Open the gates and let me in!

153
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:52,163
Long live Lord Titus,
my beloved brother.

154
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:54,065
Thanks, gentle Tribune,

155
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:56,468
noble brother Marcus.

156
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,310
And welcome, nephews,
from successful wars...

157
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:05,278
you that survive
and those that sleep in fame.

158
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,406
Titus Andronicus,

159
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:10,042
the people of Rome send thee by me,

160
00:21:10,118 --> 00:21:12,018
their tribune and their trust,

161
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:15,386
this palliament of white
and spotless hue

162
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:18,221
and name thee in election
for the empire

163
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:21,854
with these our late-deceased
emperor's sons.

164
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,160
Be candidatus, then,

165
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:26,030
and put it on,

166
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:29,696
and help to set a head
on headless Rome.

167
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:32,672
A better head her glorious body fits

168
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:35,471
than this that shakes
for age and feebleness.

169
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:46,082
Rome, I have been
thy soldier forty years

170
00:21:46,154 --> 00:21:50,523
and led my country's
strength successfully...

171
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:52,617
and buried one and twenty valiant sons.

172
00:21:52,694 --> 00:21:55,561
Give me a staff of honor for mine age,

173
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:58,099
but not a scepter to control the world.

174
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,693
Upright he held it, lords,
that held it last.

175
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,635
Titus, thou shalt but ask
and have the empery.

176
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:06,299
Proud and ambitious Tribune,
canst thou tell?

177
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,307
Patience, Prince Saturnine.

178
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:08,536
Romans, do me right!

179
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,602
Patricians, draw your swords
and sheathe them not

180
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,841
till Saturninus be Rome's emperor!

181
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,076
Andronicus, would thou
wert shipped to hell

182
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:18,119
rather than rob me
of the people's hearts!

183
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:20,017
Proud Saturnine,
interrupter of the good

184
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,022
that noble-minded Titus means to thee.

185
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,955
Content thee, Prince.

186
00:22:24,026 --> 00:22:26,460
I will restore to thee
the people's hearts

187
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:28,325
and wean them from themselves.

188
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,598
Andronicus,

189
00:22:39,675 --> 00:22:41,802
I do not flatter thee
but honor thee,

190
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:43,276
and will do till I die.

191
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:46,337
My faction,
if thou strengthen with thy friends,

192
00:22:46,415 --> 00:22:48,975
I will most thankful be.

193
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:55,649
People of Rome
and people's tribunes here,

194
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:59,285
I ask your voices
and your suffrages.

195
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:01,829
Will you bestow them friendly
on Andronicus?

196
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:10,261
To gratify the good Andronicus

197
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:12,068
and gratulate
his safe return to Rome,

198
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,665
the people will accept
whom he admits.

199
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:19,403
Tribunes, I thank you,
and this suit I make...

200
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,278
that you create
your emperor's eldest son,

201
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,319
Lord Saturnine,
whose virtues will, I hope,

202
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:27,116
reflect on Rome
as Titan's rays on Earth.

203
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:30,420
And if you will elect by my advice,

204
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,323
crown him and say,

205
00:23:32,394 --> 00:23:34,954
" Long live our emperor!"

206
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,295
Long live our Emperor Saturnine!

207
00:23:56,732 --> 00:23:58,359
Patricians and plebeians,

208
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:02,893
we create Lord Saturninus
Rome's great emperor

209
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:07,203
and say,
" Long live our Emperor Saturnine!"

210
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:24,454
Titus Andronicus,

211
00:24:24,526 --> 00:24:28,223
for thy favors done to us
in our election this day

212
00:24:28,297 --> 00:24:33,132
I give thee thanks
in part of thy deserts

213
00:24:33,202 --> 00:24:37,138
and will with deeds
requite thy gentleness.

214
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,640
And, for an onset, Titus,

215
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:47,648
to advance thy name
and honorable family,

216
00:24:47,716 --> 00:24:51,015
Lavinia will I make my empress,

217
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:53,919
Rome's royal mistress,

218
00:24:53,989 --> 00:24:56,924
mistress of my heart,

219
00:24:56,992 --> 00:25:01,258
and in the sacred Pantheon her espouse.

220
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:09,164
Tell me, Andronicus,
doth this motion please thee?

221
00:25:09,238 --> 00:25:10,637
Hmm?

222
00:25:10,706 --> 00:25:12,537
It doth, my worthy lord,

223
00:25:12,608 --> 00:25:14,303
and in this match I hold me

224
00:25:14,376 --> 00:25:15,809
highly honored of Your Grace.

225
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:48,165
And here, in sight of Rome,

226
00:25:48,243 --> 00:25:50,905
to Saturnine, king and commander
of our commonweal,

227
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:52,207
the wide world's emperor,

228
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:57,378
do I consecrate my sword,
my chariot, and my prisoners:

229
00:25:57,452 --> 00:26:00,046
presents well worthy
Rome's imperial lord.

230
00:26:06,028 --> 00:26:08,121
Thanks, noble Titus,

231
00:26:08,196 --> 00:26:11,029
father of my life.

232
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:14,159
How proud I am of thee
and of thy gifts

233
00:26:14,236 --> 00:26:16,500
Rome shall record.

234
00:26:16,571 --> 00:26:22,806
And when I do forget
the least of these unspeakable deserts,

235
00:26:22,878 --> 00:26:26,336
Romans, forget thy fealty to me.

236
00:26:26,415 --> 00:26:28,906
Now, madam,
are you prisoner to an emperor--

237
00:26:28,984 --> 00:26:31,248
to him that,
for your honor and your state,

238
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,949
will use you nobly
and your followers.

239
00:26:35,023 --> 00:26:36,581
Mmm...

240
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,627
a goodly lady.

241
00:26:39,695 --> 00:26:43,995
Trust me,
of the hue that I would choose...

242
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:46,091
were I to choose anew.

243
00:26:48,437 --> 00:26:52,464
Clear up, fair Queen,
that cloudy countenance.

244
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:55,704
Though chance of war hath wrought
this change of cheer,

245
00:26:55,777 --> 00:26:59,042
thou comest not to be made
a scorn in Rome.

246
00:26:59,114 --> 00:27:02,948
Princely shall be thy usage...

247
00:27:03,018 --> 00:27:04,986
every way.

248
00:27:05,053 --> 00:27:06,918
Rest on my word,

249
00:27:06,988 --> 00:27:11,755
and let not discontent
daunt all your hopes.

250
00:27:13,462 --> 00:27:16,556
Madam, he that comforts you

251
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:19,794
can make you greater
than queen of Goths.

252
00:27:22,437 --> 00:27:24,905
Lavinia, you are
not displeased with this?

253
00:27:24,973 --> 00:27:26,770
Not I, my lord,

254
00:27:26,842 --> 00:27:29,470
sith true nobility
warrants these words

255
00:27:29,544 --> 00:27:31,705
in princely courtesy.

256
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,078
Thanks, sweet Lavinia.

257
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:36,913
Romans, let us go!

258
00:27:36,985 --> 00:27:41,479
Ransomless here we set
our prisoners free.

259
00:27:41,556 --> 00:27:44,423
Proclaim our honors, lords,
with trump and drum.

260
00:28:09,851 --> 00:28:11,512
Lord Titus, by your leave,
this maid is mine!

261
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:14,987
How, sir!
Are you in earnest, then, my lord?

262
00:28:15,056 --> 00:28:17,149
Ay, noble Titus,
and resolved withal.

263
00:28:17,225 --> 00:28:19,819
This prince in justice
seizeth but his own.

264
00:28:19,895 --> 00:28:22,523
And that he will and shall,
if Lucius live.

265
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:29,066
Traitors, avaunt!

266
00:28:29,137 --> 00:28:31,037
Where is the emperor's guard?

267
00:28:31,106 --> 00:28:33,199
Treason, my lord,
Lavinia is surprised!

268
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:36,369
Surprised? By whom?

269
00:28:36,445 --> 00:28:37,673
By him that justly may bear

270
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:40,840
his betrothed
from all the world away.

271
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:44,852
Fear not, my lord,
I'll soon bring her back.

272
00:28:52,961 --> 00:28:55,020
Brothers, help to
convey her hence away!

273
00:28:55,096 --> 00:28:58,725
And with my sword
I'll keep this way safe.

274
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,995
My lord, you pass not here.

275
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:02,798
What, villain boy?

276
00:29:02,871 --> 00:29:05,169
Barr'st me my way in Rome, huh?

277
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,172
Help! Lucius!

278
00:29:20,522 --> 00:29:22,217
My lord!

279
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,020
You are unjust!

280
00:29:25,093 --> 00:29:27,288
And more than so,

281
00:29:27,362 --> 00:29:31,093
in wrongful quarrel,
you have slain your son.

282
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:33,794
Nor thou nor he
are any sons of mine.

283
00:29:33,869 --> 00:29:36,963
My sons would never so dishonor me.

284
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:38,471
Traitor!

285
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,701
Restore Lavinia to the emperor.

286
00:29:40,775 --> 00:29:44,472
Dead, if you will,
but not to be his wife

287
00:29:44,546 --> 00:29:47,811
that is another's lawful promised love.

288
00:30:08,236 --> 00:30:09,294
No, Titus, no!

289
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:12,670
The emperor needs her not!

290
00:30:12,741 --> 00:30:17,007
Nor her, nor thee,
nor any of thy stock!

291
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:20,844
I'll trust, by leisure,
him that mocks me once.

292
00:30:20,916 --> 00:30:22,281
Thee never!

293
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,841
Nor thy traitorous, haughty sons,

294
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,854
confederates all,
thus to dishonor me.

295
00:30:26,922 --> 00:30:28,753
But go thy ways. Go!

296
00:30:28,823 --> 00:30:31,733
A valiant son-in-law shalt thou enjoy,

297
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:34,827
one fit to bandy with
thy lawless sons!

298
00:30:34,903 --> 00:30:38,339
And therefore, lovely Tamora,

299
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:40,841
Queen of Goths,

300
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:45,209
if thou be pleased with this
my sudden choice,

301
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,441
behold.

302
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:53,113
I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride

303
00:30:53,188 --> 00:30:56,851
and will create thee
empress of Rome.

304
00:31:00,696 --> 00:31:02,288
Speak, Queen of Goths.

305
00:31:02,364 --> 00:31:03,831
Dost thou applaud my choice?

306
00:31:07,803 --> 00:31:10,397
If Saturnine advance
the queen of Goths,

307
00:31:10,472 --> 00:31:14,238
she will a handmaid be
to his desires,

308
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:17,745
a loving nurse,
a mother to his youth.

309
00:31:17,813 --> 00:31:21,078
Ascend, fair Queen,
to the Pantheon.

310
00:31:21,149 --> 00:31:26,382
Lords, accompany
your noble emperor

311
00:31:26,455 --> 00:31:27,820
and his lovely bride.

312
00:31:27,889 --> 00:31:31,586
There shall we consummate
our spousal rites.

313
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:44,435
Titus, when wert thou
wont to walk alone,

314
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:48,442
dishonored thus
and challenged of wrongs?

315
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:06,723
O Titus, see.

316
00:32:06,795 --> 00:32:10,060
Oh, see what thou hast done--

317
00:32:10,132 --> 00:32:15,126
in a bad quarrel
slain a virtuous son.

318
00:32:15,203 --> 00:32:17,228
No, foolish Tribune, no.

319
00:32:17,305 --> 00:32:20,399
No son of mine,
nor thou, nor these,

320
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:21,908
confederates in the deed

321
00:32:21,977 --> 00:32:24,070
that hath dishonored all our family.

322
00:32:24,146 --> 00:32:26,239
But let us give him burial as becomes.

323
00:32:26,314 --> 00:32:28,373
Give Mutius burial with our brethren.

324
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:32,750
Traitors, away!
He rests not in this tomb.

325
00:32:32,821 --> 00:32:34,584
Here none but soldiers

326
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:37,750
and Rome's servitors repose in fame--

327
00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:40,454
none basely slain in brawls.

328
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:43,965
Bury him where you can.
He comes not here.

329
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,159
My lord, this is impiety in you.

330
00:32:46,234 --> 00:32:47,929
He must be buried with his brethren.

331
00:32:48,003 --> 00:32:49,834
And shall, or him we will accompany!

332
00:32:49,905 --> 00:32:52,271
And shall?

333
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,138
What villain was it spake that word?

334
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,508
He that would vouch it
in any place but here.

335
00:32:57,579 --> 00:33:01,310
What, would you bury him in my despite?

336
00:33:01,383 --> 00:33:04,375
No, noble Titus...

337
00:33:04,453 --> 00:33:07,047
but entreat of thee to pardon Mutius

338
00:33:07,122 --> 00:33:08,521
and to bury him.

339
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:12,549
Marcus, even thou has
struck upon my crest

340
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:18,327
and, with these boys,
mine honor thou hast wounded.

341
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:23,064
My foes I do repute you every one,

342
00:33:23,138 --> 00:33:26,073
so trouble me no more,
but get you gone.

343
00:33:29,978 --> 00:33:33,243
He is not with himself.
Let us withdraw.

344
00:33:33,315 --> 00:33:36,910
Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.

345
00:33:41,323 --> 00:33:42,688
Father...

346
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:44,748
and in that name
doth nature speak...

347
00:33:44,826 --> 00:33:48,762
Dear Father,
soul and substance of us all...

348
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,094
Renowned Titus,
more than half my soul...

349
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:53,430
Rise, Marcus, rise.

350
00:33:53,502 --> 00:33:55,265
The dismall'st day is this

351
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:57,396
that e'er I saw,

352
00:33:57,472 --> 00:34:01,431
to be dishonored by my sons in Rome.

353
00:34:02,944 --> 00:34:05,538
Well, bury him!

354
00:34:05,614 --> 00:34:08,412
And bury me the next.

355
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,169
I'll have another.

356
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:03,621
So, Bassianus,
you have played your prize.

357
00:37:03,692 --> 00:37:07,184
God give you joy, sir,
of your gallant bride.

358
00:37:07,262 --> 00:37:09,025
And you of yours, my lord.

359
00:37:09,097 --> 00:37:11,031
I say no more nor wish no less,

360
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:12,464
and so I take my leave.

361
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:16,799
Traitor!

362
00:37:16,871 --> 00:37:20,204
If Rome have law or we have power,

363
00:37:20,275 --> 00:37:23,870
thou and thy faction
shall repent this rape.

364
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:25,537
Rape call you it, my lord,

365
00:37:25,613 --> 00:37:27,706
to seize my own,
my true-betrothed love,

366
00:37:27,782 --> 00:37:29,181
and now my wife?

367
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,218
But let the laws
of Rome determine all.

368
00:37:31,286 --> 00:37:33,117
Meanwhile, I am possessed
of that is mine.

369
00:37:33,188 --> 00:37:34,883
'Tis good, sir.

370
00:37:34,956 --> 00:37:37,390
You are very short with us.

371
00:37:37,459 --> 00:37:38,721
But if we live,

372
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:40,727
we'll be as sharp with you.

373
00:37:40,795 --> 00:37:43,730
My lord,
what I have done, as best I may,

374
00:37:43,798 --> 00:37:46,562
answer I must and shall do
with my life.

375
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:50,900
This noble gentleman--
Lord Titus here--

376
00:37:50,972 --> 00:37:53,031
is in opinion and in honor wronged.

377
00:37:53,108 --> 00:37:56,202
That in the rescue of Lavinia,
with his own hand

378
00:37:56,277 --> 00:37:58,768
did slay his youngest son
in zeal to you.

379
00:37:58,847 --> 00:38:01,748
Receive him then to favor, Saturnine.

380
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:03,374
Prince Bassianus,

381
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:05,681
leave to plead my deeds.

382
00:38:05,754 --> 00:38:09,764
'Tis thou and those
that have dishonored me.

383
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:13,242
Rome and the righteous heavens
be my judge

384
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,584
how I have loved
and honored Saturnine.

385
00:38:15,656 --> 00:38:17,248
I can do no more.

386
00:38:17,324 --> 00:38:18,552
Patience, Bassianus.

387
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:22,584
My worthy lord,
if ever Tamora were gracious

388
00:38:22,663 --> 00:38:24,927
in those princely eyes of thine,

389
00:38:24,998 --> 00:38:28,434
then hear me speak
indifferently for all.

390
00:38:28,502 --> 00:38:32,598
And at my suit, sweet,
pardon what is past.

391
00:38:32,673 --> 00:38:35,267
What, madam?
Be dishonored openly

392
00:38:35,342 --> 00:38:37,606
and basely put it up
without revenge?

393
00:38:37,678 --> 00:38:40,613
Not so, my lord.
The gods of Rome for fend

394
00:38:40,681 --> 00:38:42,945
I should be author to dishonor you.

395
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:47,282
But on mine honor dare I undertake

396
00:38:47,354 --> 00:38:49,948
for good Lord Titus'
innocence in all,

397
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:53,959
whose fury, not dissembled,
speaks his griefs.

398
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:58,964
Then at my suit
look graciously on him.

399
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:02,559
Lose not so noble a friend
on vain suppose.

400
00:39:04,671 --> 00:39:07,731
My lord, be ruled by me.

401
00:39:07,808 --> 00:39:09,241
Be won at last.

402
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:12,574
Dissemble all your griefs
and discontents.

403
00:39:12,646 --> 00:39:15,240
You are but newly planted
in your throne.

404
00:39:15,315 --> 00:39:17,579
Lest then the people
and patricians too,

405
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:20,245
upon a just survey,
take Titus' part

406
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,255
and so supplant you
for ingratitude.

407
00:39:23,323 --> 00:39:28,420
Yield at entreats,
and let me alone.

408
00:39:30,664 --> 00:39:33,258
I'll find a day
to massacre them all

409
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:36,769
and raze their faction
and their family--

410
00:39:36,837 --> 00:39:39,431
the cruel father
and his traitorous sons

411
00:39:39,506 --> 00:39:43,442
to whom I sued
for my dear son's life,

412
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:48,106
and make them know what 'tis to
let a queen kneel in the streets

413
00:39:48,181 --> 00:39:52,208
and beg for grace in vain.

414
00:39:52,286 --> 00:39:56,120
Come, come, sweet Emperor.

415
00:39:56,189 --> 00:39:57,451
Come, Andronicus.

416
00:39:57,524 --> 00:40:00,823
Take up this good old man,
and cheer the heart

417
00:40:00,894 --> 00:40:04,455
that dies in tempest
of thy angry frown.

418
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,466
Rise, Titus, rise.
My empress hath prevailed.

419
00:40:11,538 --> 00:40:14,974
I thank Your Majesty and her, my lord.

420
00:40:18,612 --> 00:40:21,638
And let it be mine honor,
good my lord,

421
00:40:21,715 --> 00:40:24,912
that I have reconciled
your friends and you.

422
00:40:24,985 --> 00:40:27,146
For you, Prince Bassianus,

423
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,154
I have passed my word and promise

424
00:40:29,222 --> 00:40:31,019
to the emperor that you will be

425
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:32,490
more mild and tractable.

426
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:35,585
And fear not, lords,
and you, Lavinia.

427
00:40:35,662 --> 00:40:40,326
By my advice,
all humbled on your knees,

428
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,665
you shall ask pardon of His Majesty.

429
00:40:48,241 --> 00:40:51,608
We do, and vow to heaven
and to Your Highness

430
00:40:51,678 --> 00:40:54,442
that what we did
was mildly as we might,

431
00:40:54,514 --> 00:40:56,846
tendering our sister's honor
and our own.

432
00:40:56,917 --> 00:40:59,442
That, on mine honor,
here I do attest.

433
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:01,544
Away, and talk not.
Trouble us no more.

434
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:02,781
Nay, nay, sweet Emperor.

435
00:41:02,856 --> 00:41:04,949
We must all be friends.

436
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:09,962
The tribune and his nephews
kneel for grace.

437
00:41:11,865 --> 00:41:14,129
I will not be denied.

438
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:18,695
Sweet heart, look back.

439
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:26,813
Marcus, for thy sake
and thy brother's here,

440
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,475
and at my lovely Tamora's entreats,

441
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:34,316
I do remit these young men's
heinous faults.

442
00:41:34,388 --> 00:41:35,514
Stand up!

443
00:41:37,824 --> 00:41:41,157
Lavinia, though you left me
like a churl,

444
00:41:41,228 --> 00:41:43,492
I found a friend.

445
00:41:43,563 --> 00:41:45,497
Come.

446
00:41:45,565 --> 00:41:48,159
If the emperor's court
can feast two brides,

447
00:41:48,235 --> 00:41:51,830
you are my guest, Lavinia,
and your friends.

448
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:57,002
This day shall be
a love-day, Tamora.

449
00:42:03,683 --> 00:42:05,947
Tomorrow,
an it please Your Majesty

450
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:08,954
to hunt the panther
and the hart with me.

451
00:42:09,022 --> 00:42:11,957
Be it so, Titus,
and gramercy, too.

452
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:54,826
Now climbeth Tamora
Olympus' top,

453
00:42:54,901 --> 00:42:58,166
safe out of fortune's shot
and sits aloft,

454
00:42:58,238 --> 00:43:01,503
secure of thunder's crack
or lightning flash,

455
00:43:01,575 --> 00:43:05,272
advanced above pale envy's
threatening reach.

456
00:43:05,345 --> 00:43:08,610
As when the golden sun
salutes the morn

457
00:43:08,682 --> 00:43:11,947
and, having gilt the ocean
with his beams,

458
00:43:12,018 --> 00:43:14,782
gallops the zodiac
in his glistering coach

459
00:43:14,855 --> 00:43:17,449
and overlooks
the highest peering hills.

460
00:43:21,194 --> 00:43:23,128
So Tamora.

461
00:43:23,196 --> 00:43:26,461
Upon her wit doth earthly honor wait,

462
00:43:26,533 --> 00:43:31,129
and virtue stoops
and trembles at her frown.

463
00:43:31,204 --> 00:43:37,143
Then, Aaron, arm thy heart
and fit thy thoughts

464
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:41,146
to mount aloft
with thy imperial mistress

465
00:43:41,214 --> 00:43:44,650
and mount her pitch,
whom thou in triumph

466
00:43:44,718 --> 00:43:49,087
long hast prisoner held
fettered in amorous chains.

467
00:43:49,156 --> 00:43:52,648
Away with slavish weeds
and servile thoughts!

468
00:43:52,726 --> 00:43:55,991
I will be bright and shine
in pearl and gold

469
00:43:56,062 --> 00:43:58,326
to wait upon
this new-made empress.

470
00:44:00,734 --> 00:44:02,599
To wait, said I ?

471
00:44:04,171 --> 00:44:07,436
To wanton with this queen,
this goddess,

472
00:44:07,507 --> 00:44:10,271
this Semiramis, this nymph,

473
00:44:10,343 --> 00:44:13,278
this siren that will charm
Rome's Saturnine

474
00:44:13,346 --> 00:44:17,612
and see his shipwreck
and his commonweal's.

475
00:44:17,684 --> 00:44:19,777
Holloa!

476
00:44:19,853 --> 00:44:21,478
What storm is this?

477
00:44:28,268 --> 00:44:30,634
Chiron,
thy years wants wit.

478
00:44:30,703 --> 00:44:32,671
Thy wit wants edge and manners

479
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:34,536
to intrude where I am graced

480
00:44:34,607 --> 00:44:37,201
and may, for aught thou knowest,
affected be.

481
00:44:37,277 --> 00:44:39,541
Demetrius, thou dost overween in all,

482
00:44:39,612 --> 00:44:40,874
and so in this,

483
00:44:40,947 --> 00:44:43,541
to bear me down with braves.

484
00:44:43,616 --> 00:44:45,880
'Tis not the difference
of a year or two

485
00:44:45,952 --> 00:44:48,853
makes me less gracious
or thee more fortunate.

486
00:44:48,922 --> 00:44:51,823
I am as able and as fit
as thou to serve

487
00:44:51,891 --> 00:44:54,052
and to deserve my mistress' grace.

488
00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:56,391
That my sword
upon thee shall approve

489
00:44:56,463 --> 00:44:59,227
and plead my passions
for Lavinia's love.

490
00:44:59,299 --> 00:45:00,561
Clubs, clubs!

491
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:02,658
These lovers will not keep
the peace.

492
00:45:02,735 --> 00:45:03,997
Why, boy,

493
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:07,005
although our mother, unadvised,

494
00:45:07,073 --> 00:45:09,337
gave you a dancing rapier
by your side,

495
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:12,003
are you so desperate grown
to threat your friends?

496
00:45:12,078 --> 00:45:13,170
Go to.

497
00:45:13,246 --> 00:45:16,010
Have your lath glued
within your sheath

498
00:45:16,082 --> 00:45:17,879
till you know better
how to handle it.

499
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,851
Meanwhile, sir,

500
00:45:19,919 --> 00:45:22,683
with what little skill I have,

501
00:45:22,755 --> 00:45:24,347
full well thou shalt perceive

502
00:45:24,424 --> 00:45:26,016
how much I dare.

503
00:45:33,766 --> 00:45:36,030
Ay, boy.

504
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:40,539
Grow ye so brave?

505
00:45:45,778 --> 00:45:47,040
How now, lords!

506
00:45:47,113 --> 00:45:49,547
Here in the emperor's palace
dare you draw

507
00:45:49,616 --> 00:45:51,550
and maintain such a quarrel openly?

508
00:45:51,618 --> 00:45:54,712
Full well I wot
the ground of all this grudge.

509
00:45:54,787 --> 00:45:56,414
I would not for a million of gold

510
00:45:56,489 --> 00:45:58,957
the cause were known to them
it most concerns,

511
00:45:59,025 --> 00:46:00,754
nor would your noble mother
for much more

512
00:46:00,827 --> 00:46:02,920
be so dishonored
in the court of Rome.

513
00:46:02,996 --> 00:46:04,759
For shame, put up.

514
00:46:04,831 --> 00:46:07,493
Not I, till I have sheathed
my rapier in his bosom

515
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:10,001
and withal thrust these reproachful
speeches down his throat

516
00:46:10,069 --> 00:46:13,334
that he hath breathed
in my dishonor here.

517
00:46:13,406 --> 00:46:16,432
For that I am prepared
and full resolved.

518
00:46:16,509 --> 00:46:18,670
Foul-spoken coward,

519
00:46:18,745 --> 00:46:20,508
that thunderest with thy tongue

520
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,844
and with thy weapon
nothing darest perform.

521
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:24,178
Away, I say!

522
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,184
Now, by the gods
that warlike Goths adore,

523
00:46:26,252 --> 00:46:27,776
this petty brabble
will undo us all.

524
00:46:27,854 --> 00:46:30,846
Why, lords,
think you not how dangerous it is

525
00:46:30,924 --> 00:46:32,687
to step upon a prince's right?

526
00:46:32,759 --> 00:46:34,693
What, is Lavinia then become so loose

527
00:46:34,761 --> 00:46:37,355
or Bassianus so degenerate
that for her love

528
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:40,194
such quarrels may be broached
without controlment,

529
00:46:40,266 --> 00:46:41,528
justice, or revenge?

530
00:46:41,601 --> 00:46:43,034
Young lords, beware!

531
00:46:43,102 --> 00:46:45,696
And should the empress know
this discord's ground,

532
00:46:45,772 --> 00:46:47,330
the music would not please.

533
00:46:47,407 --> 00:46:50,706
I care not, I,
knew she and all the world.

534
00:46:50,777 --> 00:46:55,680
I love Lavinia
more than all the world!

535
00:46:55,748 --> 00:46:57,375
Youngling...

536
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,680
learn thou to make
some meaner choice.

537
00:46:59,752 --> 00:47:01,720
Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.

538
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:10,154
Why, are ye mad?
Or know ye not in Rome

539
00:47:10,229 --> 00:47:11,992
how furious and impatient they be

540
00:47:12,065 --> 00:47:14,499
and cannot brook competitors in love?

541
00:47:16,736 --> 00:47:18,169
I tell you, lords,

542
00:47:18,237 --> 00:47:21,331
you do but plot your deaths
by this device.

543
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:22,499
Aaron...

544
00:47:22,575 --> 00:47:24,839
a thousand deaths would I propose

545
00:47:24,911 --> 00:47:27,072
to achieve her whom I love.

546
00:47:27,146 --> 00:47:30,081
To achieve her! How?

547
00:47:30,149 --> 00:47:32,640
Why makest thou it so strange?

548
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:37,588
She's a woman,
and therefore may be wooed.

549
00:47:37,657 --> 00:47:38,681
She's a woman...

550
00:47:38,758 --> 00:47:39,850
Ah!

551
00:47:39,926 --> 00:47:43,384
therefore may be won.

552
00:47:43,463 --> 00:47:45,363
She is Lavinia,

553
00:47:45,431 --> 00:47:47,695
and therefore must be loved.

554
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:53,863
Why, then, it seems,

555
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,205
some certain snatch or so
would serve your turns.

556
00:47:57,276 --> 00:47:59,710
Ay, so the turn were served.

557
00:47:59,779 --> 00:48:01,371
Aaron, thou hast hit it.

558
00:48:01,447 --> 00:48:02,914
Would you had hit it, too.

559
00:48:02,982 --> 00:48:05,974
Then should not we be tired
with this ado.

560
00:48:08,154 --> 00:48:10,816
Are you such fools
to square for this?

561
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:14,257
Would it offend you then
that both should speed?

562
00:48:14,327 --> 00:48:16,488
Faith, not me.

563
00:48:16,562 --> 00:48:18,496
Nor me, so I were one.

564
00:48:18,564 --> 00:48:19,792
For shame.

565
00:48:19,866 --> 00:48:22,494
Be friends and join
for that you jar.

566
00:48:22,568 --> 00:48:26,004
'Tis policy and stratagem
must do that you affect.

567
00:48:29,575 --> 00:48:31,440
And I have found the path.

568
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:34,842
My lords...

569
00:48:34,914 --> 00:48:37,178
a solemn hunting is at hand.

570
00:48:38,918 --> 00:48:42,684
There will
the lovely Roman ladies troop.

571
00:48:42,755 --> 00:48:46,521
Ah, the forest walks
are wide and spacious,

572
00:48:46,592 --> 00:48:49,186
and many unfrequented plots
there are

573
00:48:49,262 --> 00:48:53,028
fitted by kind for rape and villainy.

574
00:48:57,603 --> 00:49:01,403
Single you thither
then this dainty doe

575
00:49:01,474 --> 00:49:04,466
and strike her home by force,

576
00:49:04,544 --> 00:49:06,637
if not by words.

577
00:49:06,713 --> 00:49:10,149
This way, or not at all,
stand you in hope.

578
00:49:11,718 --> 00:49:12,810
Come.

579
00:49:12,885 --> 00:49:14,648
Come. Our empress,
with her sacred wit,

580
00:49:14,721 --> 00:49:17,315
will we acquaint
with all that we intend.

581
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:04,532
He that had wit
would think that I had none

582
00:50:04,604 --> 00:50:07,198
to bury so much gold under a tree,

583
00:50:07,273 --> 00:50:09,207
never after to inherit it.

584
00:50:10,777 --> 00:50:13,712
Let him that thinks of me
so abjectly know

585
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:17,876
that this gold must coin
a stratagem which,

586
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,383
cunningly effected,

587
00:50:19,452 --> 00:50:23,548
will beget
a very excellent piece of villainy.

588
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:29,228
And so repose, sweet gold,
for their unrest

589
00:50:29,295 --> 00:50:32,423
that have their alms
out of the empress' chest.

590
00:50:41,307 --> 00:50:42,740
My lovely Aaron,

591
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:44,902
wherefore lookst thou sad

592
00:50:44,977 --> 00:50:48,879
when everything doth
make a gleeful boast?

593
00:50:48,948 --> 00:50:53,112
The birds chant melody
on every bush.

594
00:50:53,186 --> 00:50:59,250
The snake lies rolled
in the cheerful sun.

595
00:50:59,325 --> 00:51:04,854
The green leaves quiver
with the cooling wind.

596
00:51:06,766 --> 00:51:10,702
Under their sweet shade,
Aaron, let us sit.

597
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:12,362
Ha ha ha!

598
00:51:12,438 --> 00:51:16,807
And after conflict, we may,

599
00:51:16,876 --> 00:51:20,368
each wreathed in the other's arms,

600
00:51:20,446 --> 00:51:22,209
our pastimes done,

601
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:24,715
possess a golden slumber.

602
00:51:24,784 --> 00:51:27,048
Whiles hounds and horns

603
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,555
and sweet, melodious birds be unto us

604
00:51:30,623 --> 00:51:33,217
as is a nurse's song of lullaby

605
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:35,226
to bring her babe asleep.

606
00:51:35,294 --> 00:51:38,786
Madam, though Venus
govern your desires,

607
00:51:38,865 --> 00:51:41,459
Saturn is dominator over mine.

608
00:51:41,534 --> 00:51:45,561
What signifies my deadly-standing eye,

609
00:51:45,638 --> 00:51:48,573
my silence, and my cloudy melancholy?

610
00:51:48,641 --> 00:51:51,075
No, madam,
these are no venereal signs.

611
00:51:54,814 --> 00:51:56,748
Vengeance is in my heart,

612
00:51:56,816 --> 00:51:59,250
death in my hand.

613
00:51:59,318 --> 00:52:02,253
Blood and revenge are
hammering in my head.

614
00:52:03,756 --> 00:52:07,522
Hark, Tamora,
the empress of my soul,

615
00:52:07,593 --> 00:52:10,027
which never hopes more heaven

616
00:52:10,096 --> 00:52:11,393
than rests in thee...

617
00:52:14,267 --> 00:52:17,031
This is the day of doom
for Bassianus.

618
00:52:17,103 --> 00:52:18,866
Ha ha!

619
00:52:18,938 --> 00:52:21,702
His Philomel must lose
her tongue today.

620
00:52:23,276 --> 00:52:25,710
Thy sons make pillage of her chastity

621
00:52:25,778 --> 00:52:28,713
and wash their hands
in Bassianus' blood.

622
00:52:34,787 --> 00:52:36,335
Seest thou this letter?

623
00:52:36,555 --> 00:52:38,455
Take it up, I pray thee,

624
00:52:38,524 --> 00:52:40,617
and give the king
this fatal-plotted scroll.

625
00:52:46,365 --> 00:52:49,095
Question me no more.
We are espied.

626
00:52:50,836 --> 00:52:53,805
Ah, my sweet Moor,
sweeter to me than life!

627
00:52:53,873 --> 00:52:57,309
No more, great Empress.
Bassianus comes.

628
00:52:57,376 --> 00:52:59,139
Be cross with him,

629
00:52:59,211 --> 00:53:02,738
and I'll go fetch thy sons
to back thy quarrels,

630
00:53:02,815 --> 00:53:04,248
whatsoe'er they be.

631
00:53:10,489 --> 00:53:11,854
Who have we here?

632
00:53:13,492 --> 00:53:14,754
Rome's royal empress,

633
00:53:14,827 --> 00:53:17,921
unfurnished of her
well-beseeming troop?

634
00:53:17,997 --> 00:53:21,763
Or is it Dian, habited like her,

635
00:53:21,834 --> 00:53:23,768
who hath abandoned her holy groves

636
00:53:23,836 --> 00:53:26,430
to see the general hunting
in this forest?

637
00:53:26,505 --> 00:53:29,099
Saucy controller of
our private steps!

638
00:53:29,175 --> 00:53:31,769
Had I the power
some say Dian had,

639
00:53:31,844 --> 00:53:34,005
thy temples should be
planted presently with horns,

640
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,603
as was Actaeon's.

641
00:53:35,681 --> 00:53:37,649
And the hounds should drive upon

642
00:53:37,716 --> 00:53:39,274
thy new-transformed limbs,

643
00:53:39,351 --> 00:53:42,650
unmannerly intruder as thou art!

644
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:44,450
Under your patience,
gentle Empress.

645
00:53:44,523 --> 00:53:46,616
'Tis thought you have
a goodly gift in horning

646
00:53:46,692 --> 00:53:49,126
and to be doubted
that your Moor and you

647
00:53:49,195 --> 00:53:52,790
are singled forth
to try experiments.

648
00:53:52,865 --> 00:53:55,459
Jove shield your husband
from his hounds today!

649
00:53:55,534 --> 00:53:58,002
'Tis pity they should
take him for a stag.

650
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:01,039
Why are you sequestered
from all your train,

651
00:54:01,106 --> 00:54:04,234
dismounted from
your snow-white, goodly steed,

652
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:06,574
and wandered hither to an obscure plot

653
00:54:06,645 --> 00:54:08,909
accompanied but with a barbarous Moor

654
00:54:08,981 --> 00:54:11,381
if foul desire
had not conducted you?

655
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:14,317
And, being intercepted in your sport,

656
00:54:14,386 --> 00:54:16,411
great reason that my noble lord

657
00:54:16,488 --> 00:54:17,819
be rated for sauciness.

658
00:54:19,658 --> 00:54:22,183
I pray you, let us hence,

659
00:54:22,261 --> 00:54:24,821
and let her 'joy
her raven-colored love.

660
00:54:24,897 --> 00:54:28,094
This valley fits
the purpose passing well.

661
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:31,102
The king my brother
shall have notice of this.

662
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,764
Good king, to be so mightily abused!

663
00:54:37,509 --> 00:54:40,376
Why have I patience
to endure all this?

664
00:54:41,547 --> 00:54:43,811
Yah!

665
00:54:43,882 --> 00:54:45,440
Aah!

666
00:54:45,517 --> 00:54:48,611
How now, dear sovereign
and our gracious mother!

667
00:54:48,687 --> 00:54:51,622
Why doth Your Highness
look so pale and wan?

668
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,955
Have I not reason,
think you, to look pale?

669
00:54:55,027 --> 00:54:58,292
These two have 'ticed me
hither to this place--

670
00:54:58,364 --> 00:55:01,458
a barren, detested vale,
you see it is.

671
00:55:01,533 --> 00:55:04,093
And when they showed me
this abhorred pit,

672
00:55:04,169 --> 00:55:08,731
they told me here,
at dead time of the night,

673
00:55:08,807 --> 00:55:14,268
a thousand fiends,
a thousand hissing snakes,

674
00:55:14,346 --> 00:55:17,247
ten thousand swelling toads

675
00:55:17,316 --> 00:55:20,752
would make such fearful
and confused cries

676
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:23,083
as any mortal body hearing it

677
00:55:23,155 --> 00:55:27,592
should straight fall mad
or else die suddenly.

678
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:31,596
No sooner had they told
this hellish tale

679
00:55:31,664 --> 00:55:36,101
then straight they told me
they would bind me here

680
00:55:36,168 --> 00:55:39,137
and leave me to
this miserable death.

681
00:55:39,204 --> 00:55:42,264
And then...

682
00:55:42,341 --> 00:55:45,276
they called me foul adulteress,

683
00:55:45,344 --> 00:55:47,778
lascivious Goth,

684
00:55:47,846 --> 00:55:49,438
and all the bitterest terms

685
00:55:49,515 --> 00:55:52,109
that ever ear
did hear to such effect.

686
00:55:52,184 --> 00:55:56,450
And had you not
by wondrous fortune come,

687
00:55:56,522 --> 00:56:00,788
this vengeance on me
had they executed.

688
00:56:07,232 --> 00:56:10,724
Revenge it,
as you love your mother's life,

689
00:56:10,803 --> 00:56:14,569
or be ye not henceforth
called my children.

690
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,132
This is a witness
that I am thy son.

691
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:21,941
And this for me,
struck home to show my strength.

692
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:35,421
Ay.

693
00:56:35,494 --> 00:56:37,928
Come, Semiramis!

694
00:56:37,996 --> 00:56:40,089
Nay, barbarous Tamora,

695
00:56:40,165 --> 00:56:41,962
for no name fits thy nature
but thy own!

696
00:56:42,034 --> 00:56:43,433
Give me the poniard.

697
00:56:43,502 --> 00:56:46,300
Your mother's hand shall right
your mother's wrong.

698
00:56:46,372 --> 00:56:48,135
Stay, madam.

699
00:56:48,207 --> 00:56:51,768
Here is more belongs to her.

700
00:56:51,844 --> 00:56:57,339
First thrash the corn,
then after burn the straw.

701
00:56:57,416 --> 00:57:01,113
This minion stood upon her chastity,

702
00:57:01,186 --> 00:57:04,883
upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,

703
00:57:04,957 --> 00:57:08,552
and with that painted hope
she braves your mightiness.

704
00:57:08,627 --> 00:57:11,892
And shall she carry this
unto her grave?

705
00:57:11,964 --> 00:57:13,556
And if she do,

706
00:57:13,632 --> 00:57:15,566
I would I were a eunuch.

707
00:57:15,634 --> 00:57:17,295
Ha ha ha ha!

708
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:20,065
Drag hence her husband
to some secret hole

709
00:57:20,139 --> 00:57:23,575
and make his dead trunk
pillow to our lust.

710
00:57:23,642 --> 00:57:27,237
But when ye have
the honeyye desire,

711
00:57:27,312 --> 00:57:30,907
let not this wasp
outlive us all to sting.

712
00:57:30,983 --> 00:57:33,918
I warrant you, madam,
we will make that sure.

713
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,579
Come, mistress.

714
00:57:36,655 --> 00:57:39,249
Now perforce we will enjoy

715
00:57:39,324 --> 00:57:41,918
that nice preserved honesty of yours.

716
00:57:41,994 --> 00:57:45,054
O Tamora,
thou bearest a woman's face--

717
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,757
I will not hear her speak.

718
00:57:46,832 --> 00:57:48,163
Away with her.

719
00:57:48,233 --> 00:57:51,430
Sweet lords,
entreat her hear me but a word.

720
00:57:51,503 --> 00:57:54,836
Oh, listen, fair madam.

721
00:57:54,907 --> 00:57:58,104
Let it be your glory
to see her tears,

722
00:57:58,177 --> 00:58:00,111
but be your heart to them

723
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:02,511
as unrelenting flint
to drops of rain.

724
00:58:02,581 --> 00:58:05,550
When did the tiger's young ones
teach the dam?

725
00:58:05,617 --> 00:58:09,053
Oh, do not learn her wrath.

726
00:58:09,121 --> 00:58:11,715
She taught it thee?

727
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:15,886
The milk thou suckst from her
did turn to marble.

728
00:58:15,961 --> 00:58:18,896
Yet every mother
breeds not sons alike.

729
00:58:18,964 --> 00:58:22,400
Do thou entreat her
show a woman's pity.

730
00:58:24,136 --> 00:58:28,402
What, wouldst thou have me
prove myself a bastard?

731
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:33,870
Oh, be to me,
though thy hard heart say no,

732
00:58:33,946 --> 00:58:37,245
nothing so kind,
but something pitiful!

733
00:58:37,316 --> 00:58:42,155
I know not what it means.
Away with her.

734
00:58:42,233 --> 00:58:43,427
Let me teach thee!

735
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:45,435
For my father's sake
that gave thee life

736
00:58:45,503 --> 00:58:47,698
when well he might
have slain thee!

737
00:58:47,772 --> 00:58:50,639
Hadst thou in person
never offended me,

738
00:58:50,709 --> 00:58:53,041
even for his sake am I pitiless.

739
00:58:53,111 --> 00:58:56,512
Remember, boys,
I poured forth tears in vain

740
00:58:56,581 --> 00:58:58,708
to save your brother
from the sacrifice,

741
00:58:58,783 --> 00:59:01,547
but fierce Andronicus
would not relent.

742
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:04,247
Therefore away with her.
Use her as you will.

743
00:59:04,322 --> 00:59:06,290
The worse to her,
the better loved of me.

744
00:59:10,095 --> 00:59:14,429
Tamora, be called a gentle queen,

745
00:59:14,499 --> 00:59:17,696
and with thine own hands
kill me in this place!

746
00:59:17,769 --> 00:59:20,363
And tumble me into
some loathsome pit

747
00:59:20,438 --> 00:59:24,033
where never man's eye
may behold my body.

748
00:59:24,109 --> 00:59:28,205
Do this,
and be a charitable murderer.

749
00:59:28,279 --> 00:59:31,373
So should I rob
my sweet sons of their fee?

750
00:59:31,449 --> 00:59:32,711
No.

751
00:59:32,784 --> 00:59:35,685
Let them satisfy
their lust on thee.

752
00:59:35,754 --> 00:59:39,019
Away! For thou hast
stayed us here too long.

753
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:42,582
No grace? No womanhood?!

754
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:45,720
Aaah! Beastly creature!

755
00:59:45,797 --> 00:59:47,731
Confusion fall!

756
00:59:47,799 --> 00:59:50,359
Nay!
I'll stop your mouth!

757
00:59:50,435 --> 00:59:54,064
Farewell, my sons.
See that you make her sure.

758
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,131
Ne'er let my heart know
merry cheer indeed

759
00:59:58,209 --> 01:00:00,769
till all the Andronici be made away.

760
01:00:03,715 --> 01:00:07,014
Now will I hence
to seek my lovely Moor

761
01:00:07,085 --> 01:00:11,954
and let my spleenful sons
this trull deflower.

762
01:00:33,144 --> 01:00:35,772
Come on, my lords,
the better foot before.

763
01:00:35,847 --> 01:00:37,747
Straight will I bring you
to the loathsome pit

764
01:00:37,816 --> 01:00:39,681
where I espied
the tiger fast asleep.

765
01:00:39,751 --> 01:00:42,481
My sight is very dull,
whate'er it bodes.

766
01:00:42,554 --> 01:00:44,112
And mine, I promise you.

767
01:00:44,189 --> 01:00:45,713
Were it not for shame,

768
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:48,486
well could I leave
our sport to sleep awhile.

769
01:01:08,713 --> 01:01:10,203
Aaah!

770
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,342
What, art thou fallen?

771
01:01:16,454 --> 01:01:19,446
What subtle hole is this...

772
01:01:19,524 --> 01:01:25,394
whose mouth is covered
with rude-growing briers,

773
01:01:25,463 --> 01:01:29,160
upon whose leaves are drops
of new-shed blood?

774
01:01:29,234 --> 01:01:32,032
Speak, Brother.
Hast thou hurt thee with the fall?

775
01:01:32,103 --> 01:01:34,663
O Brother, with the
dismall'st object hurt

776
01:01:34,739 --> 01:01:37,606
that ever eye with sight
made heart lament.

777
01:01:37,675 --> 01:01:39,006
Why dost not comfort me

778
01:01:39,077 --> 01:01:40,669
and help me out of
this unhallowed

779
01:01:40,745 --> 01:01:41,905
and bloodstained hole?

780
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:44,813
My heart suspects more
than mine eye can see.

781
01:01:44,883 --> 01:01:47,511
To prove thou hast
a true-divining heart,

782
01:01:47,585 --> 01:01:49,610
Aaron and thou look down into this den

783
01:01:49,687 --> 01:01:52,178
and see a fearful sight
of blood and death.

784
01:01:52,257 --> 01:01:53,656
Aaron is gone!

785
01:01:53,725 --> 01:01:55,556
Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,

786
01:01:55,627 --> 01:01:56,651
all on a heap...

787
01:01:56,728 --> 01:01:58,457
like to a slaughtered lamb.

788
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:00,157
O Brother, help me!

789
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,328
I have not strength
to pluck thee to the brink!

790
01:02:05,403 --> 01:02:06,870
Aaah!

791
01:02:11,843 --> 01:02:13,743
Along with me.

792
01:02:13,811 --> 01:02:16,678
I'll see what hole is here,

793
01:02:16,748 --> 01:02:19,808
and what he is that now
is leapt into it.

794
01:02:19,884 --> 01:02:22,148
Say!

795
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:25,018
Who art thou that lately didst descend

796
01:02:25,089 --> 01:02:28,183
into this gaping hollow
of the earth?

797
01:02:28,259 --> 01:02:30,227
The unhappy sons of old Andronicus...

798
01:02:30,295 --> 01:02:33,059
brought hither in a most unlucky hour

799
01:02:33,131 --> 01:02:35,599
to find thy brother Bassianus dead!

800
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:37,362
My brother dead?

801
01:02:37,435 --> 01:02:39,369
I know thou dost but jest.

802
01:02:39,437 --> 01:02:43,100
He and his lady
both are at the lodge.

803
01:02:43,174 --> 01:02:46,541
'Tis not an hour
since I left him there.

804
01:02:46,611 --> 01:02:48,806
Where is my lord the king?

805
01:02:50,281 --> 01:02:52,044
Here, Tamora...

806
01:02:52,116 --> 01:02:54,550
though grieved with killing grief.

807
01:02:54,619 --> 01:02:56,678
And where is thy brother Bassianus?

808
01:02:56,754 --> 01:02:58,688
Now to the bottom dost
thou search my wound.

809
01:02:58,756 --> 01:03:01,156
Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.

810
01:03:01,226 --> 01:03:04,787
Oh, then all too late
I bring this fatal writ.

811
01:03:04,862 --> 01:03:06,887
"And if we miss
to meet him handsomely--

812
01:03:06,965 --> 01:03:09,399
sweet huntsman Bassianus 'tis we mean--

813
01:03:09,467 --> 01:03:12,163
do thou so much as dig
the grave for him.

814
01:03:12,237 --> 01:03:13,932
Thou know'st our meaning.

815
01:03:14,005 --> 01:03:15,870
Look for thy reward...

816
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:18,408
among the nettles at the elder tree

817
01:03:18,476 --> 01:03:20,410
which overshades
the mouth of that same pit

818
01:03:20,478 --> 01:03:22,173
where we decreed to bury Bassianus.

819
01:03:22,247 --> 01:03:24,738
Do this and purchase us
thy lasting friends."

820
01:03:24,816 --> 01:03:26,374
O Tamora! Was ever heard the like?

821
01:03:26,451 --> 01:03:28,749
This is the pit
and this the elder tree.

822
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:31,288
Look, sirs,
if you can find the huntsman out

823
01:03:31,356 --> 01:03:32,687
that should have murdered
Bassianus here.

824
01:03:32,757 --> 01:03:33,689
My gracious lord...

825
01:03:33,758 --> 01:03:37,285
here is the bag of gold.

826
01:03:39,631 --> 01:03:41,121
Two of thy whelps,

827
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:42,860
fell curs of bloody kind,

828
01:03:42,934 --> 01:03:47,064
have here bereft
my brother of his life!

829
01:03:47,138 --> 01:03:49,800
Sirs, drag them from the pit
unto the prison.

830
01:03:49,874 --> 01:03:52,604
There let them bide
until we have devised

831
01:03:52,677 --> 01:03:55,305
some never-heard-of
torturing pain for them.

832
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,472
High Emperor,

833
01:03:56,547 --> 01:04:00,506
upon my feeble knee I beg this boon

834
01:04:00,585 --> 01:04:02,109
with tears not lightly shed
that this fell fault

835
01:04:02,186 --> 01:04:03,448
of my accursed sons...

836
01:04:03,521 --> 01:04:05,148
accursed, if the fault
be proved in them--

837
01:04:05,223 --> 01:04:06,690
If it be proved?!

838
01:04:06,758 --> 01:04:09,886
You see it is apparent!

839
01:04:09,961 --> 01:04:11,189
Who found this letter?

840
01:04:11,262 --> 01:04:12,661
Tamora, was it you?

841
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:15,164
Andronicus himself did take it up.

842
01:04:15,233 --> 01:04:17,997
I did, my lord.

843
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:19,593
Yet let me be their bail,

844
01:04:19,671 --> 01:04:21,571
for by my father's reverend tomb I vow

845
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:24,005
they shall be ready
at Your Highness' will

846
01:04:24,075 --> 01:04:25,542
to answer their suspicion
with their lives.

847
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:29,376
Thou shalt not bail them!

848
01:04:31,049 --> 01:04:31,981
See thou follow me.

849
01:04:35,586 --> 01:04:38,521
Some bring the murdered body,
some the murderers.

850
01:04:38,589 --> 01:04:42,150
Let them not speak a word!
The guilt is plain!

851
01:04:44,162 --> 01:04:46,426
For by my soul,

852
01:04:46,497 --> 01:04:48,931
were there worse end than death,

853
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,026
that end upon them
should be executed.

854
01:04:59,877 --> 01:05:02,675
Andronicus,
I will entreat the king.

855
01:05:02,747 --> 01:05:05,682
Fear not thy sons.
They shall do well enough.

856
01:05:08,286 --> 01:05:11,744
Come, Lucius, come.
Stay not to talk with them.

857
01:05:34,515 --> 01:05:37,848
So now go tell--
an if thy tongue can speak--

858
01:05:37,919 --> 01:05:41,013
who 'twas that cut thy tongue
and ravished thee.

859
01:05:41,089 --> 01:05:42,818
Write down thy mind,

860
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:44,915
bewray thy meaning so,

861
01:05:44,993 --> 01:05:47,257
and if thy stumps
will let thee,

862
01:05:47,328 --> 01:05:48,556
play the scribe.

863
01:05:50,198 --> 01:05:52,666
See how with signs and tokens
she can scrowl.

864
01:05:52,734 --> 01:05:55,862
Go home!
Call for sweet water.

865
01:05:55,937 --> 01:05:58,633
Sweet water!
Hither, sweet water!

866
01:05:58,706 --> 01:06:01,197
Wash thy hands!

867
01:06:01,275 --> 01:06:03,209
She hath no tongue to call

868
01:06:03,277 --> 01:06:04,869
nor hands to wash!

869
01:06:04,946 --> 01:06:08,541
And so let's leave her
to her silent walks.

870
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:13,212
And 'twere it my case,
I should go hang myself...

871
01:06:13,287 --> 01:06:16,222
if thou hadst hands
to help thee knit the cord.

872
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:18,224
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha ha!

873
01:06:48,189 --> 01:06:49,850
Who is this?

874
01:06:49,924 --> 01:06:53,416
My niece?

875
01:06:53,494 --> 01:06:56,588
If I do dream,

876
01:06:56,664 --> 01:07:00,156
would all my wealth
would wake me.

877
01:07:00,234 --> 01:07:01,462
If I do wake,

878
01:07:01,536 --> 01:07:04,835
some planet strike me down

879
01:07:04,906 --> 01:07:07,898
that I may slumber
in eternal sleep.

880
01:07:07,975 --> 01:07:10,307
Speak...

881
01:07:10,378 --> 01:07:13,040
gentle Niece.

882
01:07:13,114 --> 01:07:17,244
What stern, ungentle hands
have lopped

883
01:07:17,318 --> 01:07:22,017
and hewed and made thy body bare
of her two branches?

884
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:23,682
Those...

885
01:07:23,758 --> 01:07:26,488
sweet ornaments...

886
01:07:26,561 --> 01:07:31,225
whose circling shadows
kings have sought to sleep in.

887
01:07:31,299 --> 01:07:34,530
Why dost not speak to me?

888
01:08:07,635 --> 01:08:08,932
Come.

889
01:08:09,003 --> 01:08:11,528
Let us go...

890
01:08:14,609 --> 01:08:17,043
and make thy father blind,

891
01:08:17,111 --> 01:08:19,978
for such a sight
will blind a father's eye.

892
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:24,750
An hour's storm will drown
the fragrant meads.

893
01:08:24,819 --> 01:08:28,414
What will whole months of tears
thy father's eyes?

894
01:08:28,489 --> 01:08:33,392
Do not draw back,
for we will mourn with thee.

895
01:08:33,461 --> 01:08:36,726
Oh, could our mourning
ease thy misery!

896
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:50,725
Hear me, grave fathers!
