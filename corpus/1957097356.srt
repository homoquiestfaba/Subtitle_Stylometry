2
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,875
(scary music)

3
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:52,290
On October 31, 1988,
10-year-old Robert Maxwell

4
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:54,498
attended a classmates
Halloween party.

5
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,748
Several of the children
there tormented Robert,

6
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,206
giving him a panic attack.

7
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,581
His nose began to
bleed uncontrollably.

8
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,748
Confused and scared,
he ran out the house

9
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,373
as children chased him deep
into the neighboring woods

10
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,208
known as Diablo's Den.

11
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,208
That night, eight children
returned but Robert did not.

12
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,081
Through the following weeks,

13
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,831
a Fall Creek Valley search
party scoured the woods,

14
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,750
but he was never found.

15
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:25,623
As the years passed,
many claimed to see the ghost of Robert

16
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,290
wandering the streets
on Halloween night.

17
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:29,915
Still wearing his costume

18
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:33,165
leaving a crimson trail
from his bleeding nose.

19
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:36,458
Thus began the urban
legend of Bloody Bobby.

20
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:43,000
(typewriting sounds)

21
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,417
(turning pages)

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,831
I just want this all to go away.

23
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:53,667
I know.

24
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:58,498
Maybe this could be
kind of therapeutic

25
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,375
for you to talk
about all of this.

26
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,706
You're not gonna
spin this around?

27
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,583
No I won't, Alex.

28
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:14,125
I'm a journalist too you know.

29
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:16,583
I've seen it all

30
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,123
and I know when I'm being duped.

31
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,458
I'm not gonna dupe you.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,290
This...

33
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:26,248
This is the biggest tragedy

34
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,208
in the history of
Fall Creek Valley.

35
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,667
It's not gonna go away.

36
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:34,665
You know, maybe I could
write my own story huh?

37
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:38,081
That way it wouldn't
have all the lies

38
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,623
that other people
would put into it.

39
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,458
Yeah I don't think you could
be very objective about it.

40
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:45,500
It doesn't matter anyway.

41
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,373
People are gonna take away
from this whatever they want.

42
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,623
I could say whatever
I want to say

43
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,458
and you could write
whatever you want.

44
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,873
It's not gonna stop
it from becoming

45
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,333
some twisted urban legend.

46
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:01,417
Parents are gonna find their
kids in the dark chanting.

47
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:04,623
(scribbling)

48
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,042
As if they're trying
to channel his spirit.

49
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,708
Bring him back to life.

50
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,915
They're gonna hear
their kids whispering,

51
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:15,206
Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby!

52
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,623
Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby!

53
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,873
Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby!

54
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,040
Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby!

55
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:24,373
Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby!

56
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,873
Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby!

57
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,415
Ooh!

58
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:32,540
That was like shaving my fuzzy
man-purse with a switchblade!

59
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:34,040
Hardcore!

60
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:36,248
My body is shakin'
and my head is quakin'

61
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,498
after that skull-pounding
number from Jetset Rejects.

62
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,165
If you can't get
enough from that band,

63
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:44,206
you can catch them
tomorrow night

64
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,790
at our Annual
Hallow-Scream Creepshow.

65
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:50,748
Rumor has it that
lead singer Mike Scott

66
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,581
will be judging the
costume contest.

67
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:57,081
First prize for Best Male
Costume is 5,000 big ones.

68
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,540
First prize for the ladies

69
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:01,833
is a night alone with
Mike Scott himself.

70
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,581
Now we've been
dropping clues all week

71
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,290
for the secret location
of this annual rock fest.

72
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:11,040
Last clue for you comes
tomorrow at two o'clock sharp.

73
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,831
Your last chance for this
devlishly-rockin good time

74
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,956
brought to you by 101.6.

75
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,748
Okay, listen, I know we've
been to Hallow-Scream

76
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,331
for the past last like 20 years

77
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:24,540
but I am so giddy I want to
pee in my pants! (laughs)

78
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:27,456
No seriously we are gonna
have the best costumes.

79
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,373
They are gonna kick so much ass!

80
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,290
Costumes?

81
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:33,206
What costumes?

82
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,498
I wanted to surprise you.

83
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,956
You're gonna be He-Man
and I am gonna be She-Ra!

84
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,456
Uh!

85
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:43,123
Oh great a shitty gay-ass
cartoon from the 80s!

86
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,331
Cool!

87
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,706
I can't believe
you just said that!

88
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,292
She-ra was my idol!

89
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,292
Aw man that show was propaganda.

90
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:56,542
It was a gay
recruitment cartoon.

91
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,165
Here we go.

92
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,748
Aw don't give me that.

93
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,042
Alright, look, gay guys
can't reproduce right?

94
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:11,123
Alright, look, you got He-man.

95
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,831
This buffed up hunk
protector of the universe.

96
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,250
But what's his true identity?

97
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,708
Prince Adam.

98
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:22,790
Boring, pale-faced,
purple-wearing sissy bitch.

99
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:24,998
Even his pet is a fucking pussy!

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,248
(laughing)

101
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,498
I'm not saying that
because its a cat.

102
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,581
Like it's all scared
and shit all the time.

103
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,831
So then you got Prince Adam

104
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,373
who wields his mighty
magic sword and bam!

105
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,083
By the Honor of Grayskull!

106
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,165
Aw fuck that for the
Honor of Grayskull shit.

107
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:40,706
That was She-ra's thing.

108
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,873
He-man said, "By the
power of Gray..."

109
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,331
"By the Power of Grayskull."

110
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,081
"I have the Power!"

111
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,831
Oh, yeah, so you know
a lot about He-man

112
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,958
for someone who doesn't
really like the show.

113
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:54,167
So, anyway, after Prince
Adam gets the power,

114
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:57,123
he transforms into He-man.

115
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,790
Tan.

116
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,873
Deep voice.

117
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,290
Shirtless with furry pants on.

118
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:03,498
Mm-hmm.

119
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,581
He was the inspiration
for male strippers

120
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,708
for the next 30 years!

121
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:10,040
Oh so what you are saying is
you think He-man was sexy.

122
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:12,040
No, I never said sexy.

123
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:13,250
I said He-man was gay.

124
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,625
Pay attention.

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,915
Look at all the other characters

126
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:21,540
from Masters of the Universe.

127
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:22,831
Man-at-Arms.

128
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,373
Gay.

129
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,540
Merman.

130
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:26,375
Gay.

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,040
Beastman.

132
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:29,873
Totally gay.

133
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,706
I mean Fisto.

134
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,542
Fisto?

135
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,331
Supergay!

136
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,373
One million percent gay!

137
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,165
Alright then so all these
buffed-up homoerotic men

138
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:42,081
spend all their time
fighting for Grayskull.

139
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,665
And do you know what the
Castle of Grayskull truly was?

140
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:46,248
An All Man's Clubhouse.

141
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,583
No bitches allowed.

142
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,083
Sorry, women.

143
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,540
It's as simple as this.

144
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,581
Gay guys cannot reproduce.

145
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,248
So they have to recruit.

146
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,248
So they make this
awesome cartoon filled

147
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,248
with tons of gay overtones
to recruit future members

148
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,667
to join the Gay Alliance
later on down the road.

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,833
And I'm not being
homophobic either.

150
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:10,956
Just simple science.

151
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:14,417
Recruit or die off.

152
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:16,581
(sighing)

153
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:17,831
Don't give me that shit.

154
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,123
Yeah, I hardly think
it works like that.

155
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,331
I actually think that's
the dumbest thing

156
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,623
that's ever come
out of your mouth.

157
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,998
And, believe me, I've
heard some dumb shit.

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,373
Hey, you're going the wrong way.

159
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,415
It's a shortcut.

160
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:29,792
Over my dead body.

161
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:35,540
- (car crashing)
- (tires screeching)

162
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:36,375
What was that?

163
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,333
It's nothing.

164
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:42,956
You okay?

165
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:43,792
Yeah.

166
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:46,456
No, no, no stay in the car!

167
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,290
Okay?

168
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:48,125
I've gotta check it out.

169
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:52,583
- (haunting music)
- What?

170
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:55,540
What, what?

171
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,625
- (car door creaking)
- We hit a pumpkin!

172
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,956
What the fuck?

173
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:06,206
- (crickets chirping)
- (car door cracks)

174
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,081
Some asshole left a pumpkin
in the middle of the road.

175
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,248
Fuckin' up my rig!

176
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,500
(slow musicbox music)

177
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,540
Ash, just get back
in the car, okay?

178
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:15,498
Let's just go!

179
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,706
I gotta check this shit out!

180
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,167
(nature sounds)

181
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,956
This is bullshit!

182
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,250
I'm calling a tow truck!

183
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:34,290
(eerie music)

184
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:36,500
(clanking)

185
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:49,708
Hello?

186
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,500
(slow scary music)

187
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,540
(sharp dramatic music)

188
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:08,373
Don't go too far.

189
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,208
Take this.

190
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:10,998
Thank you.

191
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,583
(haunting music)

192
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:28,250
(ghostly laughing)

193
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:42,167
(slow haunting music)

194
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:56,790
(ominous music)

195
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:59,083
(grunting)

196
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,458
(distant smashing sound)

197
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,956
(creepy music)

198
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,208
Ash!

199
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,458
(weeping)

200
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,956
(scary music)

201
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,040
- (loud banging)
- (screaming)

202
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:39,542
(pulsating intense music)

203
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,417
(police radio chattering)

204
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:34,250
(haunting music)

205
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,081
What do we have?

206
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,042
I'm not sure but I bet we'll
find more answers down there.

207
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,956
Been down there yet?

208
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,456
No, not yet.

209
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,498
I wanted to get this scene
all squared away first.

210
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,248
So the vehicle is
registered to Ash Simpson.

211
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,790
There's a lot of
cash left in the car

212
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:55,331
so we can rule out robbery.

213
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,083
And based on this driver's
license that I found?

214
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:01,958
That is Crystal Cochran.

215
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,375
No signs of Ash Simpson.

216
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,667
(haunting music)

217
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,083
Did you find anything else?

218
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:30,331
Another gutless corpse
in Diablo's Den!

219
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,208
(sharp intense music)

220
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:39,083
(guitar solo music)

221
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:18,375
- (alarm blaring)
- (light tropical music)

222
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,998

223
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,456

00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:09,706
(door creaks open and closed)

233
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,250
(sound of urinating)

234
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:16,208
Reggie, it stinks in here!

235
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:22,375
What happened to your face?

236
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,583
What, I just woke up?

237
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:27,623
Just get in the shower

238
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,123
I can smell you from here.

239
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:29,958
(fart)

240
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,540
(sound of curtain closing)

241
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:35,292
(sound of shower)

242
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,081
Gross!

243
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,290
Gross!

244
00:15:39,292 --> 00:15:40,125
Gross!

245
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:42,125
Blehh!

246
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:46,792
(pleasant piano music)

247
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,917
(bleeps and bloops)

248
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,873
Hey, Oswald!

249
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:58,873
There she is!

250
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,165
Where are you, in a hotel room?

251
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,123
Oh, yeah, I'm in
my cousin's room.

252
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,415
The bum just woke up.

253
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:05,956
He's taking a shower right now.

254
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:10,125
Oh, so what you're saying is
you have a few minutes alone?

255
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,540
Oswald!

256
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:13,040
I only have like two minutes!

257
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:15,665
That's all I need,
baby! (laughs)

258
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:16,498
Aaahhh!

259
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,331
Oswald!

260
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,790
Your lunch is ready!

261
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:19,665
Okay!

262
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,000
In a minute, Ma!

263
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,792
(chuckles) Sorry about that.

264
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,831
So I can't finally wait to
see you tonight in person!

265
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,165
This meeting?

266
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,165
Long overdue!

267
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:33,665
Mmm-hmm.

268
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,373
My heart is beating faster
just thinking about it!

269
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,123
Mine too, cowboy!

270
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,581
Mine too!

271
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,417
Nice!

272
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,998
Uh, how do these smell?

273
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,956
Ohh!

274
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,748
Um! (laughs)

275
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,581
Eww!

276
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,998
You know what?

277
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,042
If you need a second
opinion the answer is no!

278
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,456
Eww!

279
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,292
Oh, God!

280
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,373
Hey, did you see
that email from Alex?

281
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,831
Uh, what?

282
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,290
It looks like he finally
made it back into the States.

283
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:03,040
He's gonna be here
tomorrow morning.

284
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:04,292
It's about time.

285
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:06,875
Are you decent yet?

286
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,458
Yeah.

287
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,790
You know you could've
stayed with me.

288
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:15,042
I have a whole three
bedroom house to myself now.

289
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,748
Um, aside from the fact that

290
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,083
Grandma might be
haunting the place,

291
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,998
I really don't want to
hear you having cybersex

292
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,831
with your internet boyfriend.

293
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,623
Oh my God, that only
happened like one time

294
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,081
and it was purely by accident.

295
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,915
How does cybersex
become accidental?

296
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:38,206
Maybe I've accidentally had
cybersex and just don't know it.

297
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,748
Anyway I'm gonna meet
up with him tonight

298
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,206
for the first time ever.

299
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,748
Yeah, we're going to
this big Halloween party.

300
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,165
Hey, you should come!

301
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:46,081
You know what?

302
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,458
It's actually at your old house!

303
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:49,165
Huh?

304
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:49,956
Yeah Willy Anderson
bought your old house

305
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,583
like six months ago!

306
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,915
You said he was in
Wall Street, New York.

307
00:17:57,917 --> 00:17:59,165
Doing that Wall Street stuff.

308
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:02,290
Yeah, I guess he
like tried to screw

309
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:04,915
his boss's daughter or assistant
or something like that.

310
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,748
So he totally got fired
for sexual harassment.

311
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,581
So he's back in good ol'
Fall Creek Valley again

312
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,748
for a fresh start!

313
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,040
Hmm, I think I'd rather
have dull pencils

314
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:16,956
just shoved directly
into my eyeballs

315
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,415
then actually hang out
with Willy Anderson again.

316
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:22,581
That kid used to kick my
ass everyday in school!

317
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,581
Oh my God, Reggie.

318
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,915
It's been like 20 years.

319
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:25,792
Get over it!

320
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,040
Hey, you know a
lot of our friends

321
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,456
are gonna be there too.

322
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,040
Like Erica?

323
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:34,373
Your wallet is
right here, genius.

324
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,208
Oh, thanks.

325
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,248
Erica is actually getting
married to Jebediah Osborn.

326
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,248
Is that the Preacher's Son?

327
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,456
Mm-hmm.

328
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,581
Totally turned her life around.

329
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,956
Turned to God and
now she's marrying

330
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,581
the Son of a Preacher Man!

331
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,417
Wow.

332
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,206
Oh and I believe Madison

333
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,498
is also gonna be there tonight.

334
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,333
Really?

335
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:58,373
Well maybe I'm not really
doing anything tonight.

336
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,206
Maybe I'll go with you.

337
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,623
Yay, you're coming!

338
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,456
You're coming!

339
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,790
Yay, goodie!

340
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,206
I'm so excited!

341
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:08,248
You can meet my new
internet boyfriend, Oswald.

342
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,706
Oswald Jeffrey Gacy.

343
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,248
Hm!

344
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,331
You realize that sounds like
a serial killer name, right?

345
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,500
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

346
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:23,083
(hard rock music)

347
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,375
(sound of egg cracking)

348
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,708
You have to remember
to chew, Deputy.

349
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,498
Sorry.

350
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,498
My first meal of the day.

351
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,623
We had a pretty early
call this morning.

352
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,873
Are people getting
teepeed already?

353
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,206
Not exactly.

354
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,581
The Sheriff and I, we
were up at Diablo's...

355
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,665
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

356
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:56,542
We found some graffiti.

357
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,542
Hmm.

358
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,873
And that's it.

359
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:08,206
Unless the bottomless pit
here wants something else.

360
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,125
No, I'm good.

361
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,542
Never ever say Diablo's
Den again, okay?

362
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:19,875
Okay.

363
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,042
It'll be 14.26.

364
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,415
Thank you, Sheriff.

365
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:37,250
Sure.

366
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,623
Actually, Sheriff,
can I holler at you

367
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,540
real quick for a second?

368
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:46,540
Um, early this morning

369
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:50,415
I saw some kid crawl over
my fence into my yard.

370
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,956
And I'm pretty sure
it's Missy Waters' kid.

371
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:57,248
Ya see, he wasn't
too keen about me

372
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,083
uh bangin' his Mom a
couple months back.

373
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,042
I mean, we had some really
good times together.

374
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,165
You know but then she tried
to get all serious with me

375
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,373
and everything.

376
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,706
And actually between you and I,

377
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,165
it would be a disservice

378
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:15,623
to all the ladies in Fall
Creek Valley if I settle down.

379
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,706
(chuckling)

380
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,123
So I dropped her.

381
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,206
And then she just
kept calling me up,

382
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,915
you know, cryin' on the phone.

383
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:23,373
"Can we work things out?"

384
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,665
Then I hear her Son
back there sayin' shit.

385
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:25,498
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

386
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,498
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

387
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,623
What happened this morning?

388
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:32,248
Oh, oh um, shit, nothin'
out of the ordinary.

389
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,873
I mean other than that
little punk tresspassin'!

390
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:35,790
Alright.

391
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,581
I'll keep an eye out.

392
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,125
Thanks, Sheriff!

393
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,415
You were saying you found
something down in the Den?

394
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:48,623
No, you know what?

395
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,248
I really can't say where we were

396
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,373
because I still don't know
the area all that well.

397
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:59,375
But I could use someone to
really show me around town.

398
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,998
(bell dinging)

399
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,583
Hey, order up!

400
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:06,208
Be right back.

401
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,625
Mind if I join you, Deputy?

402
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:22,667
(grunting)

403
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,456
Ahh.

404
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,790
(mysterious music)

405
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:30,000
The Sheriff is right.

406
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,706
This town gets a little anxious

407
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,333
at the mention of Diablo's Den.

408
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,542
Especially her.

409
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,581
She's spent the last
20 some-odd years

410
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,583
trying to forget
about that place.

411
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:47,458
Excuse me?

412
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:51,708
I know you and the
Sheriff found something

413
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,040
down in Diablo's
Den this morning.

414
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,123
I don't know what
you're talkin...

415
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,875
Don't deny it, Son.

416
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:00,958
It may be just a
little graffiti.

417
00:23:02,417 --> 00:23:06,290
But I know why the Sheriff
wants it kept a secret.

418
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:09,040
And why is that Mister?

419
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:10,623
Granger.

420
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:11,875
Horace Granger.

421
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,292
You'll get to know me.

422
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:18,750
I own Granger's Pub
off of Harvest Way.

423
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:23,748
It ain't graffiti
that the Sheriff

424
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,250
wants to keep quiet about.

425
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,458
It's the location.

426
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:34,625
Ah!

427
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,250
(sound of door)

428
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:37,417
Doctor Nolan!

429
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,998
Meet our new Deputy.

430
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,498
Nice to meet you.

431
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,706
Please join us.

432
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,581
She's doing a story
on Diablo's Den.

433
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,625
Do you mind if I
take some notes?

434
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:51,498
Go ahead.

435
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,748
Thank you.

436
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,998
You see Diablo's Den
is older than the town

437
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,250
of Fall Creek Valley.

438
00:23:58,625 --> 00:23:59,708
Some say it's haunted.

439
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:04,708
Some believe it is
a gateway to Hell.

440
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:09,833
Either way, everyone
steers clear of that place.

441
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:11,875
Why?

442
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:18,290
You didn't feel anything
while you were out there?

443
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:19,958
Something unnatural?

444
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,333
Something unexplained?

445
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:27,250
Maybe even a little evil?

446
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:31,458
(mysterious music)

447
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,331
You mentioned Madison.

448
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,792
What does she want to forget?

449
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,167
Some bad things happened
out there over the years.

450
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,498
It started when she was a kid.

451
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,748
A 10-year-old boy,
Bobby Maxwell,

452
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,958
went missing on
Halloween night 1988.

453
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:57,750
He went to a party
and never came home.

454
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,498
The whole town was in a
frenzy looking for him

455
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,167
but no trace of the
boy was ever found.

456
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:09,831
What does that have to
do with Diablo's Den?

457
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:10,583
Ah!

458
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:15,290
About two months after
his disappearance,

459
00:25:15,292 --> 00:25:16,915
some kid came forward
with information

460
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:18,917
about what happened that night.

461
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:22,040
Said a group of
kids from the party

462
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:24,917
taunted and chased
Bobby into the woods.

463
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,708
Bobby fell down into the ravine
that overlooks the highway

464
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:33,750
and was hit by a car.

465
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:36,956
And they never found the body?

466
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:37,792
No.

467
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:43,500
Like I said, no trace
of him anywhere.

468
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:45,790
Not in the woods.

469
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:46,665
On the highway.

470
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:47,500
Nowhere.

471
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:53,706
The only thing that showed up
was a tattered old comic book

472
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:57,542
with his name on it
found in Diablo's Den.

473
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:05,375
Some think the evil in Diablo's
Den just swallowed him up.

474
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:11,208
This Bobby.

475
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:13,956
Is he one of Madison's friends?

476
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:14,792
No.

477
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:16,458
No.

478
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:19,750
The kid who came
forward said that she

479
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:26,581
was one of the
kids chasing Bobby.

480
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:27,417
Deputy.

481
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:29,708
Have a great day.

482
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,333
I have a feeling it's going
to be one helluva night.

483
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:37,206
Shall we?

484
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:38,792
Nice to meet you.

485
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:49,123
So are you gonna lick
the plate clean too?

486
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:53,000
(laughs) No, I've still
gotta have my protein shake.

487
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,831
- Do I owe you anything or...
- No.

488
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:56,790
Did the Sheriff
take care of it all?

489
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:57,500
No, he took care of it.

490
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:04,456
(light upbeat music)

491
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,458
That really isn't
necessary, Deputy.

492
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,915
Please.

493
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:10,125
Call me Trevor.

494
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,375
Thank you.

495
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:18,042
Whew!

496
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,998
Kind of a boring town.

497
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,415
Keeps you pretty busy.

498
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:32,250
And?

499
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:37,542
Bobby Maxwell is kin to me.

500
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,333
I never did get over his death.

501
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:47,833
That's why I stay in Fall
Creek Valley to find closure.

502
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,625
Can you hear voices?

503
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:55,042
Sometimes.

504
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,498
How about right now?

505
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,333
Now?

506
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,123
It's the quiet before the storm.

507
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:07,958
(loud rock music)

508
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:12,665
Service!

509
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:13,500
Hello?

510
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:16,040
Who's working here these days?

511
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:16,875
You'll see.

512
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,250
Oh my God!

513
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:22,208
Reggie?!

514
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:28,790
Oh my God, I haven't seen
you in like I don't know,

515
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,083
like, 20 years?

516
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:33,706
Hello?

517
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:35,206
Could we order now?

518
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:37,331
God, why does the service
always suck around here?

519
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,958
Very funny, Tiffany.

520
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:41,831
What can I get you guys?

521
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,040
Coffee.

522
00:28:43,042 --> 00:28:44,958
- Black as midnight on a...
- Black like your soul.

523
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,248
Uh, yeah.

524
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,498
I'll have a grande
no foam soy latte

525
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,040
at exactly 130 degrees please.

526
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:53,498
Okay.

527
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,956
So two coffees at whatever
temperature I damn well choose

528
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:56,331
to serve them at!

529
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,456
And I'll go get
those while you guys

530
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:00,625
take a look at the menus.

531
00:29:09,042 --> 00:29:12,292
(intense screamo music)

532
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:18,748
What the fuck, Madison?

533
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,623
I can't hear my customers.

534
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,623
The clues, woman, I
need to hear the clues!

535
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,998
(on radio) Begins
in just a few hours.

536
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,165
The last and final clue
as to its secret location:

537
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:32,956
"Halloween is no time
for pencils and books

538
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:36,498
"but time to raise Hell
with devils and ghouls."

539
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,790
Ooh, now that is the
easiest of them all!

540
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:41,998
Tonight is the night to
rock out with your cock out

541
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,290
if you got one,

542
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:45,248
if not then jam out
with your clam out!

543
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:50,250
(laughs) Brought to
you by 101.6, The RAWK.

544
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:53,456
Are you guys ready to order?

545
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,956
I want the chocolate
chip pancakes.

546
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:56,831
Ooh, those sound
so good right now!

547
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,665
I haven't had those
since I was 10!

548
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:02,040
You guys, we don't have
those on the menu anymore.

549
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:03,623
Come on!

550
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:05,208
Arrggh.

551
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:09,331
Okay, let me see what
kind of influence I have

552
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:10,248
on the big guy.

553
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,417
I'll be right back.

554
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:18,042
Wow this place is
like a time capsule.

555
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,667
Yeah that's kind of why I
wanted to bring you here.

556
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,665
I am so sorry about that, guys.

557
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:31,581
Big Dick McGee has been
like all week crazy

558
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:34,748
about the clues for that
Hallow-Scream Party.

559
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:39,542
Oh, tell him to try the
Riverdale University campus.

560
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:42,081
Okay.

561
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:45,331
No shit, really?

562
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:48,248
Well, I mean, that's
based on the last clue.

563
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:53,123
Um, the DJ mentioned
books, pencils,

564
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:55,581
and partying with devils.

565
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:59,623
And I know that the
Riverdale University mascot

566
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,706
is a crimson devil.

567
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:04,331
So that's just my guess.

568
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:07,875
So, any chance I'll be
seeing you there tonight?

569
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:11,665
Um, no, actually we
already have plans.

570
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:12,956
Madison, Reggie
wants to go with us

571
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,331
to the party at Will's tonight.

572
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:15,373
Oh, yeah?

573
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,165
Oh I was invited to that party!

574
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,333
Maybe I'll stop in for a few.

575
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:33,998
Wow, I thought Liz
was into girls now

576
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,917
but I think she's got a
thing for you, Reggie.

577
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:39,042
Hmm.

578
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:43,331
Anyways, I'll make sure
to pass on the message.

579
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,706
With any luck, this
will be the first year

580
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,250
he'll actually go to the party.

581
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:52,248
So, hey, what time can I stop
by for my Halloween costume?

582
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,123
I'll be home by Four.

583
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:55,915
Okay, cool. Four.

584
00:31:55,917 --> 00:31:58,748
Well I'll stop by then
and, girl, can I just say

585
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,081
I am so glad that you're
coming out with us tonight.

586
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:02,790
I mean it's about time
you finally got over

587
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:04,373
your prudish ways.

588
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:05,206
Whatever.

589
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:06,248
I am so not a prude.

590
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,915
I had a kid out of wedlock.

591
00:32:07,917 --> 00:32:10,040
Oh, yeah, I guess you just
got your sluttiness on

592
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:11,623
a little bit too early.

593
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,248
But, hey, oh my God, guess what?

594
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,498
My guy is coming tonight.

595
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,123
Oswald, my internet guy?

596
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:16,998
(laughs)

597
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,040
Uh, Mask Guy!

598
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:21,706
- (giggling)
- What?

599
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:22,581
Mask?

600
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:23,750
Who is this Mask Guy?

601
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:27,498
Well, if you must know,

602
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,123
when me and Oswald
first started chatting,

603
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:31,623
we would wear masks.

604
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:33,456
We just thought it would
help us open up a bit more

605
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:35,498
if we could preserve
the anonymity.

606
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,331
Mm-hmm.

607
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:37,540
Wow.

608
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:38,956
Tiffany, you just
keep finding yourself

609
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:41,081
in weirder and
weirder situations.

610
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:41,917
Wait.

611
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:45,790
Were you two wearing masks
when you were having the...

612
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:47,040
You know.

613
00:32:47,042 --> 00:32:48,331
None of your business!

614
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,956
Okay, it's not what you
wanted but it's free,

615
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:51,958
it's on the house.

616
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:54,625
(growling noises)

617
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:56,956
You got the clue right!

618
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:57,873
What?

619
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,040
Like I said, I like that guy!

620
00:33:00,042 --> 00:33:03,623
(acoustic music)

621
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,875
(knocking)

622
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:09,165
Look, that's fine.

623
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:11,331
Just bring her back
tomorrow at nine.

624
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:12,498
I just got home from work.

625
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,165
I don't have time for this!

626
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:15,250
Hi, come in.

627
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:17,373
Listen, I have guests.

628
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:18,208
I have to go.

629
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:28,040
Sorry about that, guys.

630
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:30,498
Penny is with her Dad tonight.

631
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,998
Is this her?

632
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yup!

633
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,208
That's my little girl.

634
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:39,540
Wow.

635
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:42,708
She's looks exactly like you
did when we were that age.

636
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:51,040
Tiffany, darlin',
Oswald just told me

637
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:52,748
he's gonna be there at eight!

638
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,081
Oh, Madison, that is fabulous!

639
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,625
- You like it?
- Mm-hmm!

640
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:57,417
Alright.

641
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:02,083
Who made these masks?

642
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,415
Uh, Penny did.

643
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,873
Yeah, isn't she a neat kid?

644
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:07,456
(laughs)

645
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:08,706
You know what?

646
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:09,831
She made those in
Mrs. Johnson's class.

647
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,581
- Really?
- Yeah!

648
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:12,873
That old bat is still alive?

649
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:14,873
(laughs) Yeah!

650
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:15,915
(laughing)

651
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:17,748
Who says Old Bat anymore?

652
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,998
I do, Tiffany.

653
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,831
Wasn't she like 50 or
100 when we had her?

654
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:23,790
No, I think she was
in her thirties.

655
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:25,081
Yeah, you're probably right.

656
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:27,581
She was probably
only, only looked 50.

657
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,248
(laughs)

658
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,040
Old Mrs. J still has her

659
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:33,081
Halloween mask
designing contest, huh?

660
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,165
Yup.

661
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:35,417
She sure does.

662
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,248
Remember when we had ours?

663
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,081
Yeah, you made the Elephant Man.

664
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:41,915
Come on!

665
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:43,123
It was horrible!

666
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,915
It was supposed to
be Michael Jackson.

667
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:45,833
Whatever.

668
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:50,081
Alex got second place.

669
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,458
I think I got third place.

670
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:54,083
Who got first place?

671
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,542
As if anybody could forget huh?

672
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:01,958
Bobby Maxwell.

673
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,917
I totally got cheated.

674
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:10,373
Cheated?

675
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,415
Yeah I had Old Bat Johnson
a couple years later

676
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:15,123
and they weren't doing
that mask contest anymore.

677
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:16,206
(phone ringing)

678
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:17,123
Oh!

679
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:19,040
It's Oswald!

680
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:20,581
I am just gonna
take this outside.

681
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,875
(giggling)

682
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,792
(door opening and closing)

683
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,956
Yeah, I guess getting
divorced wasn't all that bad.

684
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:32,081
I got rid of a scumbag and
I got this beautiful house

685
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:33,915
and three full-time jobs.

686
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:35,290
Three jobs?

687
00:35:35,292 --> 00:35:36,123
Yeah.

688
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,415
Wow.

689
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:40,415
Anyways, I want to
hear all about you

690
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:41,958
and the last 20 years.

691
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:47,667
Um, nah, it's, you
don't want to hear it.

692
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:49,998
It's not pretty.

693
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,373
Come on.

694
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:53,415
It can't all be that bad.

695
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:54,292
Mostly.

696
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:00,873
You know, when we
left Fall Creek Valley

697
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,417
I was labeled the troubled kid.

698
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:06,706
And I guess I just
kind of kept up with

699
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:08,540
that label ever since.

700
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:12,123
So 20 years of straight trouble?

701
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:14,331
Yeah and I've been okay
the past three years.

702
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:16,665
You know, I've just
been kind of laying low

703
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:18,831
and staying clean.

704
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:20,915
What Tiff, she,
Tiffany, hasn't told you

705
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:22,415
about her deadbeat cousin yet?

706
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:24,206
Stop it.

707
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:26,706
She would never
call you a deadbeat.

708
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:29,415
And believe it or not,
she's very fond of you.

709
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:31,748
She might be getting
me confused with Alex.

710
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:36,750
No, she has nice things to
say about you both so stop it.

711
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:41,540
She said that you have your own
commercial painting company?

712
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:44,375
That's actually Alex's

713
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:48,165
and I, you know, I
sometimes kind of manage it

714
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:50,415
when he's away
playing journalist.

715
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:53,498
Yeah, Tiffany said
that he's in Africa.

716
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,915
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
he's got this great story

717
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:57,123
he's really excited about it.

718
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:59,415
And he thinks he might
win the Pulitzer.

719
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,706
Wow.

720
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:03,581
Yeah and then we got
an email this morning,

721
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:04,956
he's on his way to
Fall Creek Valley,

722
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,498
he should be here
tomorrow sometime

723
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,915
so we can go through the
estate sale, you know,

724
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:10,167
Grandma's estate sale.

725
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:14,290
Well, it would be really
nice to see him as well.

726
00:37:14,292 --> 00:37:17,042
(romantic music)

727
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:22,581
- Is, do I have...
- There's nothing on you.

728
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,206
- Oh.
- Am I staring?

729
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,331
- (laughing)
- I'm staring!

730
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:26,748
- (laughing)
- I'm staring.

731
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,583
I'm sorry!

732
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:30,790
It's just so weird!

733
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,456
I can't believe that...

734
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,706
I just can't believe
that you're here!

735
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:37,083
Standing in front
of me in my house!

736
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,415
You know, I never thought

737
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:41,917
that I was ever
gonna see you again.

738
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:44,623
I mean nobody even
knew your parents

739
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:45,917
were thinking of moving.

740
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:51,292
Just one day you don't
show up to school.

741
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:55,792
And then I went to your
house and it was empty.

742
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:00,792
Tiffany had no idea
where you were.

743
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,373
It was just like your
parents upped and left

744
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:04,750
and didn't look back.

745
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:10,000
(door opens and closes)

746
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:12,706
Okay, we have got
to get out of here.

747
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:15,500
I have so much to do to get
ready for the party tonight.

748
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:19,206
Well, I guess we're going.

749
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:22,456
Yeah I have some really
important emails to check.

750
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:23,415
I will see you there.

751
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:24,623
You better not weasel out of it.

752
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:25,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

753
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:27,040
And I am gonna go start the car

754
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:28,625
so if you're not there in
30 seconds I'm leaving.

755
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:31,958
(door opens and closes)

756
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,875
I guess I'll see you tonight.

757
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:41,373
You can tell me about
your past 20 years, huh?

758
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:42,998
(giggling)

759
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,833
Yeah.

760
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:47,208
It was really good seeing you.

761
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:51,000
I missed you.

762
00:38:57,917 --> 00:39:00,542
(spooky music)

763
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,542
(chopping sounds)

764
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:31,333
(phone ringing)

765
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,333
(knocking on door)

766
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:43,667
(door opening)

767
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:46,706
I'm sorry, little guy.

768
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:48,375
I don't have any
candy this year.

769
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:53,040
You could try going next door.

770
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:55,250
I think they have some
really cool chocolate.

771
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,500
Are your parents with you?

772
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:04,833
Do you speak English?

773
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:06,958
Habla Espanol?

774
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:12,750
What are you supposed to be?

775
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:16,706
It looks familiar.

776
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,375
Is it from a movie?

777
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:30,750
(closing door)

778
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:38,333
(knocking on door)

779
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:42,456
(opening door)

780
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:44,333
Listen, kid, I don't
have any candy.

781
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:46,623
I'm really sorry.

782
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,792
I can give you an apple.

783
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:55,917
I don't know what to tell you.

784
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:58,456
Try the neighbors.

785
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,623
I'm sure there's gonna be
houses that have candy.

786
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,290
Okay?

787
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:03,540
Happy Halloween!

788
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:04,625
(closing door)

789
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:09,958
(loud knocking)

790
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:12,292
(opening door)

791
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,667
(door creaking closed)

792
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,833
(locking sound)

793
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
(very loud knocking)

794
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:50,000
(door creaking open)

795
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,540
(intense scary music)

796
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,833
You've had your fun!

797
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:56,415
Now get the hell out of here!

798
00:41:56,417 --> 00:41:58,375
(explosive orchestral
percussion)

799
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:10,208
(door closing)

800
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:16,458
(scary music)

801
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,042
(chewing)

802
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:31,542
(rustling sounds)

803
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,375
(shower curtain opening)

804
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:46,458
(eerie music)

805
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:51,208
(unzipping sound)

806
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:06,500
(dripping sounds)

807
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:11,540
(shower turning on)

808
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:14,417
(eerie music slowly growing)

809
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:32,540
(shrill shrieking)

810
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:37,542
(fleshy stabbing and
screaming sounds)

811
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:42,208
(stilted breathing)

812
00:43:56,458 --> 00:44:01,458
Boop Boop Boop. I see you.

813
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:04,165
Oh yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

814
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:05,000
Hey!

815
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,875
(speaking in foreign language)

816
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:14,667
klaatu barada nikto

817
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:16,998
Hmm, the Devil!

818
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,708
El Diablo!

819
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:24,123
Ha ha ha!

820
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:25,625
Okay hmm mum murm.

821
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:30,498
Uh, you listen to me.

822
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,915
Fall Creek Valley.

823
00:44:31,917 --> 00:44:33,998
I'm El Diablo!

824
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,331
I'm a horny devil!

825
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:37,581
Oh, Madison!

826
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:40,373
Titty titty titty titty titty!

827
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:42,542
Oh give it to me, Madison!

828
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:47,375
(laughs) Great!

829
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:51,708
(whispering sound)
It's all your fault!

830
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:58,875
(light musicbox music)

831
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:07,958
(whispering sound)
Trick or treat!

832
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:35,040
♪ What you gonna do
when it all comes down ♪

833
00:45:35,042 --> 00:45:37,875
(hard rock music)

834
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:44,208
(party sounds)

835
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:46,081
Oh Jesus, Tiff.

836
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:47,415
What has the bastard
done with the place?

837
00:45:47,417 --> 00:45:48,248
I'm not.

838
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,498
It's...

839
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,665
It looks way different
than it used to before.

840
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:52,081
Oh my God, quit stalling Reggie.

841
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,540
There's gonna be lots of
people in there that you know.

842
00:45:54,542 --> 00:45:56,706
I have to find Madison
real fast to get my phone

843
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:59,415
'cause I just know Oswald's
been texting me like a madman!

844
00:45:59,417 --> 00:46:01,167
(laughs) Come on!

845
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:06,081
So then I said,
"B cup not C cup!"

846
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:08,373
(laughing)

847
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:10,625
(party sounds)

848
00:46:16,792 --> 00:46:17,790
Whoa!

849
00:46:17,792 --> 00:46:19,290
Tiffy baby!

850
00:46:19,292 --> 00:46:22,956
You are lookin' smokin' tonight.

851
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:24,248
Give us a twirl.

852
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,956
Thanks, Madison made
this costume for me.

853
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:27,583
Is she here by the way?

854
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:30,331
Uh!

855
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:33,581
Who is the man who's lucky
enough to be your date?

856
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:34,956
- (sighs)
- (laughing)

857
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,958
You remember Reggie, my cousin?

858
00:46:38,292 --> 00:46:39,706
Oh!

859
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:40,831
Whoa!

860
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:41,790
Dude!

861
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:42,998
I haven't seen you in a minute!

862
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,956
Oh!

863
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:45,456
Jeez, the last time I saw you...

864
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:47,458
You were shoving my
head in a toilet.

865
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,290
Well that couldn't have been
the very last time I saw you?

866
00:46:51,292 --> 00:46:53,665
That was actually the incident

867
00:46:53,667 --> 00:46:56,167
that made my family move
out of Fall Creek Valley.

868
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:00,456
Uh.

869
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:01,706
Wow!

870
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:03,498
(laughs) I mean, it
was a long time ago,

871
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,540
we we were all kids then.

872
00:47:04,542 --> 00:47:07,748
We're all grown up now, mature.

873
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,875
Let bygones be bygones.

874
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:16,456
Come on, let's get some brews!

875
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,333
Yeah come on, Reggie!

876
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:25,831
Ah, only the finest!

877
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:27,165
Pacifico Clara!

878
00:47:27,167 --> 00:47:27,998
Eh!

879
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,956
I'm alright, actually.

880
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:31,373
(speaking in foreign language)

881
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:32,665
Do you want a beer?

882
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:35,540
Do you want to pick that
up too when you're done?

883
00:47:35,542 --> 00:47:36,665
Just kiddin', man!

884
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:37,915
Thanks, Willy.

885
00:47:37,917 --> 00:47:39,748
Oh, it's Will now.

886
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:40,956
It's more manly.

887
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:44,123
Yeah, yeah ladies seem
to like it better.

888
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:44,958
By the way,

889
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:50,206
did I tell you that you are
lookin' smokin' tonight?

890
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:53,456
Yes, you did and where
is your wife by the way?

891
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:54,998
All the way in Nevada.

892
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,040
With the kids.

893
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:57,540
Parents' house.

894
00:47:57,542 --> 00:48:00,373
Hmm so is that why you're not
wearing your wedding ring?

895
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:03,540
Nah, the ring didn't
really go with the costume.

896
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:04,373
Hmm.

897
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:05,540
Hmm.

898
00:48:05,542 --> 00:48:06,915
Yeah so I have to find
Madison really bad

899
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:08,042
and get my phone.

900
00:48:09,042 --> 00:48:10,290
Come on, Reggie.

901
00:48:10,292 --> 00:48:13,375
Um, yeah, cell phones suck!

902
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:16,373
I thought you said he
wasn't all that bad.

903
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:18,873
He's a bigger jerk now
than when he was 10!

904
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:20,831
Uh, you just have to
catch him on the right day

905
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:23,748
and, believe me, that
macho attitude of his

906
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,081
is definitely compensating
for something.

907
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:28,206
I don't even want to
know how you know that.

908
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:29,248
No, you probably don't!

909
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,790
(laughing)

910
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:33,248
(upbeat rock music)

911
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,706
Arrgh!

912
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:37,915
As long as he has a big fat...

913
00:48:37,917 --> 00:48:38,748
Yeah.

914
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,665
Sausages are great!

915
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,331
I wanna bite it!

916
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:43,123
Ooh!

917
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:44,748
Who is this hot ma ma ma?

918
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,750
Hey, Erica!

919
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:49,083
Hey, you know Reggie, right?

920
00:48:50,792 --> 00:48:52,498
Hey, hey.

921
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,081
(giggling)

922
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:54,917
Girl!

923
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:56,998
Whoa!

924
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,790
(crowd roaring)

925
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:01,956
Girl, you look so hot right now!

926
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:03,292
Get a picture of us!

927
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:05,290
(camera click sounds)

928
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:06,667
Hi! (laughing)

929
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:10,373
And to think that you are
the wife of a Preacher's Son.

930
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:11,456
Correction.

931
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:12,956
Engaged.

932
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:15,248
But I do not want to think
about that right now.

933
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:19,790
I am so tired of being
the old Church lady.

934
00:49:19,792 --> 00:49:21,625
Tonight I let loose.

935
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,375
Ohh!

936
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:26,250
(laughing)

937
00:49:32,917 --> 00:49:35,373
Drink another beer!

938
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:36,873
Drink, drink!

939
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:39,456
Is he really Big Dick McGee.

940
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:40,415
(giggling)

941
00:49:40,417 --> 00:49:42,540
Bring that big dick over here.

942
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:45,248
Oh, I love that Big Dick McGee!

943
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,040
Well!

944
00:49:46,042 --> 00:49:47,581
Hey, hey, hey!

945
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:48,498
Hey, Rick.

946
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,498
The party has just arrived!

947
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,790
What is up, Tiff?!

948
00:49:50,792 --> 00:49:52,290
(laughs) Nothing.

949
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:54,708
Hey, you know Reggie!

950
00:49:56,292 --> 00:49:58,123
Holy, Re, what?

951
00:49:58,125 --> 00:49:59,540
Our Reggie Reggie?

952
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:00,375
Dude!

953
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:03,998
Shit, it's been like 20 years!

954
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,831
God, dude!

955
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:05,873
What's up man?

956
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:07,290
Wow!

957
00:50:07,292 --> 00:50:08,665
And Tiff, I am sorry Tiff,

958
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:10,665
you are just looking absolutely
stunning in that, girl.

959
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:12,958
(laughing)

960
00:50:15,042 --> 00:50:17,167
- Looking fabulous!
- Hey, Rick!

961
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:20,375
Like my costume?

962
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:22,706
Oh!

963
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:24,917
Well, yes, I do Erica.

964
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:27,206
You look good.

965
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:28,040
Hmm.

966
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:28,915
You look real good.

967
00:50:28,917 --> 00:50:30,498
(giggling)

968
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,331
You always look good!

969
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:32,540
(giggling)

970
00:50:32,542 --> 00:50:35,540
But tonight you look
downright yummy!

971
00:50:35,542 --> 00:50:37,165
(laughing)

972
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,915
I'm sure that's just that
beer right there talking, huh?

973
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:41,415
If it wasn't that one,

974
00:50:41,417 --> 00:50:42,498
it might have been the six
I had before it though.

975
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,790
(laughing)

976
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:44,583
Hey!

977
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,790
Rick, Reggie.

978
00:50:46,792 --> 00:50:48,373
Remember, Rick.

979
00:50:48,375 --> 00:50:49,831
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

980
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:51,373
I was just talking to him.

981
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:53,500
Dude, seriously, man, how
the hell you been, bro?

982
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:58,290
Uh, good I suppose, how are you?

983
00:50:58,292 --> 00:50:59,248
Aw, shit, man.

984
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:01,415
I'm cool, cool, man, I'm cool.

985
00:51:01,417 --> 00:51:03,081
I'm still stuck here
in Fall Creek Valley

986
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:06,540
but other than that I
can't complain, you know.

987
00:51:06,542 --> 00:51:08,623
Ugh, I hate to interrupt
this little love fest

988
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:10,581
but has anybody seen Madison?

989
00:51:10,583 --> 00:51:13,331
Nope, she probably
bailed out on us.

990
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:16,290
She is not fun since
she left Robbie.

991
00:51:16,292 --> 00:51:17,498
Yeah, whatever.

992
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,748
Tonight we have bait!

993
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,958
(laughing)

994
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,458
(spilling sounds)

995
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:26,748
Erica!

996
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,915
Snap, it's all right!

997
00:51:27,917 --> 00:51:29,456
(laughs) We might
have to just go ahead

998
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:30,831
and get you another drink.

999
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:32,248
(laughing)

1000
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:36,081
I mean, I know of a special
little cocktail recipe

1001
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:37,081
that I know you'll enjoy!

1002
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:38,123
Oh!

1003
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:39,081
(laughing)

1004
00:51:39,083 --> 00:51:41,125
I want to catch up with Reggie.

1005
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:45,290
See what life has handed to him.

1006
00:51:45,292 --> 00:51:47,748
See if it's been any
better than the rest of us

1007
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,331
who stayed back in Fall
Creek Valley to rot.

1008
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:51,790
Who's rotting girl?

1009
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:52,873
You just got engaged.

1010
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:54,498
Shh!

1011
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,958
Tonight I am a single lady!

1012
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,623
(laughing)

1013
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:01,123
Tomorrow when I wake up,

1014
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:04,458
I'll go back to being the
soon to be Wife of a Preacher.

1015
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:10,456
(laughs) Well
then, on that note,

1016
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:12,373
how about we go
get you that drink?

1017
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:15,956
And we'll catch up with Reg
and Tiff in a little bit?

1018
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:19,998
Come on, I know where Will
hides the good tequila.

1019
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,333
I wanna dance!

1020
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:27,956
(laughs) You know what?

1021
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:29,790
I better go get that girl.

1022
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:31,165
Something tells me that
someone is gonna have to

1023
00:52:31,167 --> 00:52:34,581
help hold her hair
back later on tonight.

1024
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:38,540
So, dude, seriously, it was
great seeing you again, man.

1025
00:52:38,542 --> 00:52:41,498
We'll catch up later, alright?

1026
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,540
Tiff!

1027
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:43,790
(giggling)

1028
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:45,500
Oh my gosh, she is such
a hot mess right now!

1029
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:49,542
Hey, are you okay, Reggie?

1030
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,915
I'm just...

1031
00:52:51,917 --> 00:52:53,415
I'm just a little anxious.

1032
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:55,998
I just keep seeing these
people that I haven't seen

1033
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,248
since I left.

1034
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:58,165
(sighs)

1035
00:52:58,167 --> 00:53:00,248
Hey, I know just what you need.

1036
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,081
Come on!

1037
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:02,167
Come with me.

1038
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:11,375
So okay, so then the dog
said, fur not furbie!

1039
00:53:13,417 --> 00:53:16,290
(laughing)

1040
00:53:16,292 --> 00:53:19,665
(spooky music box music)

1041
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:22,540
I happen to know
of a secret stash

1042
00:53:22,542 --> 00:53:24,831
that William keeps out here.

1043
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:26,581
And I think it will
be just the thing

1044
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:30,081
to calm those nerves of yours.

1045
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:32,250
Oh, let's see, here it is.

1046
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:35,000
Here.

1047
00:53:39,042 --> 00:53:40,415
I thought you were
desperate to find Maddie.

1048
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,998
I am, I am, I just
I need something

1049
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,458
to calm my nerves real quick.

1050
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:50,125
Wow, you really are nervous
about meeting Oswald, huh?

1051
00:53:52,792 --> 00:53:56,792
Yeah, I actually really
like him, Reggie.

1052
00:53:58,542 --> 00:54:00,292
What do you really
know about this guy?

1053
00:54:01,417 --> 00:54:04,706
(sighs) I know you
don't take it seriously

1054
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,123
'cause we met online
and everything

1055
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:10,583
but we've really talked a lot.

1056
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,292
We've really kind of connected

1057
00:54:15,792 --> 00:54:17,333
and shown each other our souls.

1058
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,248
By souls do you mean genitals?

1059
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:24,831
- (coughing)
- (laughing)

1060
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:27,040
Oh my God, Reggie!

1061
00:54:27,042 --> 00:54:28,456
I'm trying to have a
moment with you here.

1062
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:30,708
(laughing)

1063
00:54:37,667 --> 00:54:39,625
Do you want to walk down
to Madison's with me?

1064
00:54:41,292 --> 00:54:44,625
Is it cool if I
just hang out here?

1065
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:46,956
I just, I don't know,

1066
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:48,500
I just need some alone time.

1067
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:51,917
It's cool.

1068
00:54:53,292 --> 00:54:57,792
Well, I will be back with
Madison so don't go anywhere.

1069
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,623
I'll be right here.

1070
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:03,083
(night sounds)

1071
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:07,290
(snapping of lighter)

1072
00:55:07,292 --> 00:55:10,290
(ghostly whispering)

1073
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:14,458
(background house music)

1074
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:19,958
(scary music)

1075
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:24,956
(cb radio) This is
Sheriff Leavitt.

1076
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:27,456
We got an abandoned
vehicle at Borden Pass.

1077
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:29,123
A gold Impala.

1078
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,625
California plates.

1079
00:55:31,792 --> 00:55:34,500
Alpha Romeo One
Two Zero Charlie.

1080
00:55:57,833 --> 00:56:02,083
(spooky music)

1081
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:18,540
(cb radio) That gold
Impala is registered

1082
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:21,042
under the name of
Reggie Griffin.

1083
00:56:22,875 --> 00:56:25,750
(mysterious music)

1084
00:56:32,917 --> 00:56:34,706
(knocking)

1085
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:36,831
(tense music)

1086
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:38,625
(doorknob jangling)

1087
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:42,748
(knocking)

1088
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:45,706
Come on, Madison, I
know you're in there!

1089
00:56:45,708 --> 00:56:47,208
I really need to get my phone!

1090
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:49,915
(sighing)

1091
00:56:49,917 --> 00:56:51,042
(door creaking open)

1092
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:53,542
Madison?

1093
00:56:59,292 --> 00:57:01,873
Maddy, I think I left
my phone over here.

1094
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:04,415
(slow tense music)

1095
00:57:04,417 --> 00:57:05,665
Ugh!

1096
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:07,540
Oswald's probably been
calling me nonstop.

1097
00:57:07,542 --> 00:57:08,998
(intense music)

1098
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,748
Come on, Madison, you promised
you'd go to Will's party!

1099
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:14,042
- (door slamming)
- Huh?!

1100
00:57:15,333 --> 00:57:18,625
(light musicbox music)

1101
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:20,792
(camera sound)

1102
00:57:21,542 --> 00:57:24,500
(breathing quickly)

1103
00:57:25,417 --> 00:57:26,458
(camera sound)

1104
00:57:32,542 --> 00:57:33,458
(camera sound)

1105
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:35,958
Okay ha-ha, Madison!

1106
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:38,708
This isn't funny anymore.

1107
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:43,123
(squeaky violin music)

1108
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:44,081
(loud booming)

1109
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:46,417
(screaming)

1110
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:50,375
(night sounds)

1111
00:57:56,458 --> 00:57:57,833
(lighter clicking)

1112
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:01,083
(laughing)

1113
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,540
I didn't spill a drop!

1114
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:05,792
(giggling)

1115
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:09,248
Where are we going?

1116
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,958
- Hey, guys!
- (laughing)

1117
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,375
(sexy music)

1118
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:19,417
(giggling)

1119
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,831
(bottles falling)

1120
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,375
(giggling)

1121
00:58:31,917 --> 00:58:33,790
(light whispering)

1122
00:58:33,792 --> 00:58:35,915
Did you hear that?

1123
00:58:35,917 --> 00:58:38,000
I didn't hear anything.

1124
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:41,831
I must be hearing things.

1125
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:43,875
I thought I heard a kid.

1126
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,375
(kissing and heavy breathing)

1127
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:52,375
All your focus right now.

1128
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:54,625
(kissing)

1129
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,417
Needs to be right here on me.

1130
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:03,790
(giggling)

1131
00:59:03,792 --> 00:59:05,540
(sexy music)

1132
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,583
In the love shack!

1133
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:12,042
Are you trying to seduce me?

1134
00:59:13,042 --> 00:59:13,875
Hmm.

1135
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,542
(kissing and heavy breathing)

1136
00:59:27,708 --> 00:59:30,040
(wind blowing)

1137
00:59:30,042 --> 00:59:32,123
Did you hear that?

1138
00:59:32,125 --> 00:59:33,915
I think someone's out there.

1139
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:34,915
You know what?

1140
00:59:34,917 --> 00:59:35,790
Just fuck me.

1141
00:59:35,792 --> 00:59:37,248
Oh!

1142
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,248
Can't you just...

1143
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:40,248
Can't you just go scope it out?

1144
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,456
I'm serious.

1145
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:43,248
I just, I won't be comfortable

1146
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,831
if I know someone's right there.

1147
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:47,375
Come on, you know my situation.

1148
00:59:48,917 --> 00:59:50,165
Can you just (sighs).

1149
00:59:50,167 --> 00:59:53,248
Can you just please,
please try, please?

1150
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,290
Alright.

1151
00:59:54,292 --> 00:59:55,708
- Alright.
- Come on.

1152
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:04,083
You'll still be ready
when I get back?

1153
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:09,792
I guess I'll have to
keep myself warm won't I?

1154
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:13,081
(laughing)

1155
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:14,583
Don't be too long.

1156
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:19,167
I won't be.

1157
01:00:20,542 --> 01:00:21,375
Sexy.

1158
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:33,790
- (sharp ominous music)
- Hello?

1159
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:36,375
(wind blowing)

1160
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:46,667
Hello?

1161
01:00:49,917 --> 01:00:51,042
Somebody there?

1162
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:58,500
(ghostly giggling)

1163
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,333
Rick?

1164
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:09,292
Hello?

1165
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:15,333
(haunting giggles)

1166
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:20,708
(scary music)

1167
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:35,706
(stabbing sound)

1168
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:36,625
Ugh!

1169
01:01:37,458 --> 01:01:38,292
Ugh!

1170
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:41,956
(intense music)

1171
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:42,792
Huh!

1172
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:45,540
(screaming)

1173
01:01:45,542 --> 01:01:47,458
- (loud smacking)
- (body thudding)

1174
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:51,206
The fuck was that?

1175
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,831
Holy shit, you're bleeding!

1176
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:53,667
No shit!

1177
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:56,665
I think it's...

1178
01:01:56,667 --> 01:01:57,623
I think...

1179
01:01:57,625 --> 01:01:58,956
I think it's him.

1180
01:01:58,958 --> 01:01:59,998
I think it's him!

1181
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Him, who?!

1182
01:02:04,083 --> 01:02:05,706
He's getting up!

1183
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:06,998
(intense music)

1184
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,333
(screaming)

1185
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,415
(clears throat)

1186
01:02:17,417 --> 01:02:18,250
Hey, man.

1187
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:21,290
Hey.

1188
01:02:21,292 --> 01:02:22,083
Can I borrow your lighter?

1189
01:02:24,292 --> 01:02:25,540
Hey!

1190
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:27,248
The fuck you guys
doin' out here?

1191
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,792
Not smoking marijuana, are you?

1192
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,873
(laughs) I'm just kiddin', man!

1193
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:33,790
Ha!

1194
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:35,248
Actually this is a safe spot.

1195
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,748
You know, I have a
hidden stash out here.

1196
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:38,748
I kinda, you know, get away
from the ole ball and chain.

1197
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:39,748
Get my smoke on.

1198
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:41,165
Hey, let me hit that.

1199
01:02:41,167 --> 01:02:43,750
Suck on this little
testicle you got for a pipe.

1200
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:48,208
You alright, man?

1201
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,456
Hey!

1202
01:02:50,458 --> 01:02:51,290
I just got a headache.

1203
01:02:51,292 --> 01:02:52,956
That's all.

1204
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:55,456
Try some of this, it'll
make you feel better.

1205
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:56,540
I'm good.

1206
01:02:56,542 --> 01:02:57,625
Oh, you're okay.

1207
01:02:58,792 --> 01:03:00,998
You're not seeing what
I am seeing, dumb ass.

1208
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,123
Anyway, actually
I appreciate it,

1209
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:03,956
I have to go take a piss.

1210
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:05,958
See you asswipes on
the flip side, huh?

1211
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:12,292
I'm really nervous.

1212
01:03:13,458 --> 01:03:15,456
I'm meeting a lady
friend here tonight.

1213
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,250
A chick I met online.

1214
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:23,040
What did you say your name was?

1215
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:23,875
I didn't.

1216
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,290
Oswald.

1217
01:03:27,292 --> 01:03:28,665
(chuckling)

1218
01:03:28,667 --> 01:03:29,706
Reggie.

1219
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:31,331
(laughing)

1220
01:03:31,333 --> 01:03:35,248
Yeah, don't worry, I'm sure
you'll hear from her soon.

1221
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:36,373
(laughing)

1222
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:37,206
Reggie, huh?

1223
01:03:37,208 --> 01:03:38,498
Mm-hmm.

1224
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,583
That is a name you
don't hear everyday.

1225
01:03:42,292 --> 01:03:45,375
You wouldn't happen to be
Tiffany's cousin Reggie would you?

1226
01:03:47,333 --> 01:03:48,165
Mm-hmm.

1227
01:03:48,167 --> 01:03:49,331
Shit, man!

1228
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:50,665
That's who I'm here to meet!

1229
01:03:50,667 --> 01:03:51,498
(chuckling)

1230
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,373
Ya don't say?

1231
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:53,623
(laughing)

1232
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:54,917
Yeah, Tiff Tiff
will be here soon.

1233
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,833
Oh, man, what a small world.

1234
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:00,956
You know, I was hopin'

1235
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:03,665
I would get to meet
you sooner or later.

1236
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:05,331
I have been doing some research

1237
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:07,623
and trying to get
in touch with you.

1238
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:09,998
And then it turns out
you are the cousin

1239
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,456
of the girl I am
chatting with online.

1240
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:14,042
It is great to finally meet you!

1241
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:17,542
Why would you want to meet me?

1242
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,206
I do an internet show

1243
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:23,458
and wanted to do a couple
segments about you.

1244
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:27,206
I just think you are
an interesting cat

1245
01:04:27,208 --> 01:04:31,000
and I want to know more
about you, Reggie Griffin.

1246
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,748
You know, actually,
(clears throat)

1247
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,706
I think I need to go inside.

1248
01:04:36,708 --> 01:04:38,373
I think I need to take a piss.

1249
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,581
Uh, yeah, yeah, man.

1250
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:41,915
Hey, hey, maybe we
should re-up on brews!

1251
01:04:41,917 --> 01:04:43,873
You know, you can tell me
about yourself you know?

1252
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:44,706
Like hobbies?

1253
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:45,665
Favorite foods?

1254
01:04:45,667 --> 01:04:48,456
What your childhood was like?

1255
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,956
You know what?

1256
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:52,540
I don't think Tiffany is
gonna be coming by tonight.

1257
01:04:52,542 --> 01:04:54,081
I think she said
she's gonna be sick.

1258
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:54,915
What?

1259
01:04:54,917 --> 01:04:55,748
Dude!

1260
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:56,581
(house music)

1261
01:04:56,583 --> 01:04:58,248
Fuck!

1262
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:00,331
What's up with the line, I
gotta piss like a racehorse!

1263
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:01,790
Really, Will?

1264
01:05:01,792 --> 01:05:03,998
You throw a party and you
only have one working toilet?

1265
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,665
Okay, first of all,
the contractors told me

1266
01:05:06,667 --> 01:05:09,498
that the remodeling would
be done like two weeks ago.

1267
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,915
And I paid those
fucktards the money

1268
01:05:11,917 --> 01:05:13,831
and now I haven't
seen them since!

1269
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:15,123
Second of all, there's
a big gaping hole

1270
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:16,623
in the bathroom upstairs.

1271
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:18,873
Ooh, boo-hoo, sob story.

1272
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:20,290
It still sucks though.

1273
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:21,498
Slutty Bumble Bee
has been in there

1274
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,415
for what seems like an eternity!

1275
01:05:23,417 --> 01:05:24,915
Tell that bitch ass to hurry up

1276
01:05:24,917 --> 01:05:26,415
and get out of there!

1277
01:05:26,417 --> 01:05:28,081
Sometimes you just gotta
put them in their place!

1278
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:29,540
They're called women, Will.

1279
01:05:29,542 --> 01:05:30,456
(chuckles)

1280
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:32,290
We aren't just one of your bros.

1281
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:34,040
You can't talk like
that in front of a lady.

1282
01:05:34,042 --> 01:05:35,081
Mmm-mmm.

1283
01:05:35,083 --> 01:05:37,998
(giggling)

1284
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,248
Okay, first of all,

1285
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,956
I don't consider you
two tuna cans ladies.

1286
01:05:41,958 --> 01:05:43,456
Second of all don't
you, you know,

1287
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:45,456
go fishing on each other?

1288
01:05:45,458 --> 01:05:46,665
We're gay, yes,

1289
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:48,498
but we're still
considered women.

1290
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,123
Right.

1291
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:52,458
(chuckling)

1292
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:56,415
Lezbo Liz.

1293
01:05:56,417 --> 01:05:57,873
Lez lesbian Liz.

1294
01:05:57,875 --> 01:06:02,875
Liz Lizbo and her muff-diving
sidekick, Dykey Deli.

1295
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:04,790
Thank you, thank you

1296
01:06:04,792 --> 01:06:06,290
for reminding me
why I prefer women.

1297
01:06:06,292 --> 01:06:07,331
(giggling)

1298
01:06:07,333 --> 01:06:09,081
I really have to pee!

1299
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:10,540
I'm tempted to go
water those rosebushes

1300
01:06:10,542 --> 01:06:11,456
- outside your house.
- (laughing)

1301
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:13,290
You are not pissing in my yard.

1302
01:06:13,292 --> 01:06:14,123
Why not?

1303
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:15,331
All the guys have been.

1304
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:16,165
What?

1305
01:06:16,167 --> 01:06:17,415
Who the fuck did that?

1306
01:06:17,417 --> 01:06:18,665
You know what, I'm
gonna handle this.

1307
01:06:18,667 --> 01:06:19,581
Oh!
(knocking)

1308
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:21,040
- Hey!
- (giggling)

1309
01:06:21,042 --> 01:06:22,915
Why don't you snap that
turd off and get outta here?

1310
01:06:22,917 --> 01:06:24,165
Huh?

1311
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:25,165
There are people like
getting angry out here

1312
01:06:25,167 --> 01:06:26,333
trying to get in there!

1313
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,498
Will!

1314
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,915
Do you always have to
be such a douchebag?!

1315
01:06:30,917 --> 01:06:32,165
(chuckles)

1316
01:06:32,167 --> 01:06:33,167
Douche your bag.

1317
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:36,415
Uh!

1318
01:06:36,417 --> 01:06:37,248
What?!

1319
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:39,456
My house my rules.

1320
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:40,831
I don't wait for nobody.

1321
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:42,081
Fuck you, Will!

1322
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:42,998
Hey!

1323
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,831
(knocking)

1324
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,040
Knock it off out there!

1325
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,665
You're going to scare
the piss back in!

1326
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:47,915
(scary music)

1327
01:06:47,917 --> 01:06:49,415
You're such a
fuckin' jerk, Will.

1328
01:06:49,417 --> 01:06:50,540
I'm going to go piss in the
middle of your front lawn!

1329
01:06:50,542 --> 01:06:53,165
Yeah I dare ya, Lizbo.

1330
01:06:53,167 --> 01:06:54,498
I hope when you're
crouching out there

1331
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,290
a lesbian bug flies
up your cooch!

1332
01:06:57,292 --> 01:06:58,498
(chuckling)

1333
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:59,540
You two will be
very happy together!

1334
01:06:59,542 --> 01:07:00,873
- (laughing)
- Eat shit, Will!

1335
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:01,873
I'm gonna go in your bedroom

1336
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:03,456
and piss on your
pillows instead!

1337
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:05,373
Oh, yeah, try it, rugmuncher.

1338
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:08,165
You don't think I didn't
lock the door to the bedroom?

1339
01:07:08,167 --> 01:07:09,581
(chuckling)

1340
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:10,873
(loudly smashing)

1341
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:12,081
Get the fuck out!

1342
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:15,623
(bones crunching)

1343
01:07:15,625 --> 01:07:17,540
(toilet flushing)

1344
01:07:17,542 --> 01:07:20,750
(upbeat hip hop music)

1345
01:07:24,792 --> 01:07:25,625
Hi!

1346
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:28,375
You, don't you
work at the diner?

1347
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:31,331
Yeah, that's right, handsome.

1348
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:32,706
I never did catch your
name this afternoon.

1349
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:33,540
Reggie.

1350
01:07:33,542 --> 01:07:34,498
Hey, Liz.

1351
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,540
Nice to meet you, Reggie.

1352
01:07:35,542 --> 01:07:36,748
Nice meet you.

1353
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:37,706
I'm Deli.

1354
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:38,750
Liz's girlfriend.

1355
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:45,415
Uh, let me guess.

1356
01:07:45,417 --> 01:07:47,081
Let me guess.

1357
01:07:47,083 --> 01:07:48,331
Ladybug?

1358
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:49,790
Lumberjack!

1359
01:07:49,792 --> 01:07:51,167
Whatta dick!

1360
01:07:55,042 --> 01:07:56,583
She wasn't wearing a costume!

1361
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,415
Oh!

1362
01:07:58,417 --> 01:07:59,165
I didn't mean anything by it.

1363
01:07:59,167 --> 01:08:00,248
I'm sorry.

1364
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,081
Naw, don't worry about it.

1365
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:02,331
She's just PMS-ing.

1366
01:08:02,333 --> 01:08:04,000
Makes me wanna go
back to men again.

1367
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:11,290
So, is this still the only
bathroom in the house?

1368
01:08:11,292 --> 01:08:12,915
Yeah, I've been
waiting here forever.

1369
01:08:12,917 --> 01:08:15,248
Then Will cut in front of me.

1370
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:17,290
Been in there like
10 minutes now.

1371
01:08:17,292 --> 01:08:19,415
Knowing him he's doing
hand-to-gland combat

1372
01:08:19,417 --> 01:08:20,748
while dreaming of Deli.

1373
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:21,750
He's such a jerk!

1374
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:24,165
(knocking)
Hurry up, Will!

1375
01:08:24,167 --> 01:08:26,831
The line has tripled since
you've gone in there!

1376
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:29,040
Will!
(knocking)

1377
01:08:29,042 --> 01:08:31,331
- Goddammit!
- (spooky music)

1378
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:34,000
You know, I used to
live in this house.

1379
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:36,706
And the door is a little,

1380
01:08:36,708 --> 01:08:38,165
there's a little trick with it.

1381
01:08:38,167 --> 01:08:39,956
I could get us in there if
you wanted to get back at him,

1382
01:08:39,958 --> 01:08:40,956
we could open...

1383
01:08:40,958 --> 01:08:41,915
Hell, yeah!

1384
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:43,123
What are you waiting for?

1385
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:46,831
(jiggling doorknob)

1386
01:08:46,833 --> 01:08:48,998
(spooky music)

1387
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,081
Wait, Reggie, what is that?

1388
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:51,917
What's what?

1389
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,750
I think it's blood.

1390
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:56,708
Whoa!

1391
01:08:59,125 --> 01:09:03,290
(banging on door)
Will!

1392
01:09:03,292 --> 01:09:05,958
(intense music)

1393
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:10,500
(screaming)

1394
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:15,417
(screaming)

1395
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:23,456
Someone should call the cops.

1396
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:27,123
(intense percussive music)

1397
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:28,956
(phone) 911, what's
your emergency?

1398
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:30,665
I'm at this party.

1399
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,415
And someone is dead outside.

1400
01:09:32,417 --> 01:09:35,000
(wind blowing)

1401
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:39,917
Huh!

1402
01:09:40,708 --> 01:09:43,375
(painful breathing)

1403
01:09:44,542 --> 01:09:49,042
- (intense music)
- (loudly screaming)

1404
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:57,875
(scared breathing)

1405
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:02,373
(frightening woosh)

1406
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:04,208
Please, let me go!

1407
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:08,125
I remember you.

1408
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:11,081
You're Bobby Maxwell!

1409
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:12,040
(breathing quickly)

1410
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:14,708
(intense music)

1411
01:10:15,542 --> 01:10:16,623
(knocking)

1412
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:17,458
Madison!

1413
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:19,873
Reggie!

1414
01:10:19,875 --> 01:10:22,167
(intense music)

1415
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:25,417
(crunching)

1416
01:10:26,667 --> 01:10:29,125
(terrifying ghost sounds)

1417
01:10:31,417 --> 01:10:35,167

(loud crunch)

1421
01:10:57,208 --> 01:10:58,706
Argh!

1422
01:10:58,708 --> 01:11:01,417
(intense music)

1423
01:11:02,042 --> 01:11:02,750

1424
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:04,417

1425

(heavy breathing)

1426
01:11:11,708 --> 01:11:14,875
(ghostly whispering)

1427
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:21,081
(heavy breathing)

1428
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:23,915

(doorknob turning)

1430
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:35,456
Madison.

1431
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:36,292
No!

1432
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:38,708
Maddy!

1433
01:11:41,125 --> 01:11:43,833
(intense music)

1434
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:48,165

(footsteps)

1454
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:24,331
Freeze!

1455
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,250
Reggie, you're done!

1456
01:13:29,542 --> 01:13:31,248
What happened tonight?

1457
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:32,083
I stabbed him.

1458
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:34,667
He was right there.

1459
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:37,333
Who did you stab?

1460
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:39,748
Bobby Maxwell, he,

1461
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:41,333
he came back and killed Tiffany.

1462
01:13:42,708 --> 01:13:44,167
Bobby Maxwell?

1463
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:46,873
I guess the next thing
you are gonna tell us

1464
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:49,040
is that Bobby Maxwell also
killed the man we found

1465
01:13:49,042 --> 01:13:50,748
in the trunk of your car.

1466
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:51,583
What?

1467
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:54,915
Don't play innocent, Reggie.

1468
01:13:54,917 --> 01:13:57,165
The man's name was Ash Simpson.

1469
01:13:57,167 --> 01:14:00,290
You killed him, his
girlfriend Crystal Cochran,

1470
01:14:00,292 --> 01:14:01,498
and everybody else tonight.

1471
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:02,333
No.

1472
01:14:03,292 --> 01:14:04,123
No.

1473
01:14:04,125 --> 01:14:05,667
It was Bobby Maxwell.

1474
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:07,790
(sighing)

1475
01:14:07,792 --> 01:14:09,625
He killed Tiffany,
Madison, Erica and Will.

1476
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:13,083
I saw their bodies.

1477
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:15,415
You forgot about Rick?

1478
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:16,956
- (intense music)
- Rick, too?

1479
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:17,792
Cut the crap.

1480
01:14:20,417 --> 01:14:21,581
None of this was me.

1481
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:23,040
I didn't hurt
anyone except Bobby.

1482
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:25,875
I stabbed him and
he was right there.

1483
01:14:27,042 --> 01:14:29,748
There is no Bobby Maxwell.

1484
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:31,458
Reggie, it was you.

1485
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:34,290
(knocking on door)

1486
01:14:34,292 --> 01:14:36,458
Is this some kind of
twisted revenge thing?

1487
01:14:37,542 --> 01:14:39,083
Are you still holding a grudge?

1488
01:14:40,292 --> 01:14:41,125
No.

1489
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:47,000
You pathetic, pill
poppin' piece of shit!

1490
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,415
I always knew you were no good.

1491
01:14:51,417 --> 01:14:54,250
But I never ever thought you'd
be capable of any of this.

1492
01:14:55,333 --> 01:14:56,167
I'm not.

1493
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,667
It was Bobby Maxwell.

1494
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:02,623
It was all Bobby Maxwell.

1495
01:15:02,625 --> 01:15:04,083
(knocking on door)

1496
01:15:07,792 --> 01:15:09,167
(door creaking open)

1497
01:15:14,333 --> 01:15:15,625
(door creaks shut)

1498
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,206
What are you doing here?

1499
01:15:18,208 --> 01:15:20,875
I'm interested in a case.

1500
01:15:21,875 --> 01:15:23,831
We got a situation.

1501
01:15:23,833 --> 01:15:25,750
Those voices in your head, huh?

1502
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:28,665
They're not gonna
help you anymore.

1503
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:30,706
You want this to
be over tonight?

1504
01:15:30,708 --> 01:15:31,542
Right now?

1505
01:15:32,708 --> 01:15:33,998
Tell me the truth.

1506
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,790
I'm a Paranormal
Forensic Investigator.

1507
01:15:36,792 --> 01:15:38,873
I don't got time for this.

1508
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:40,375
I got cop shit to do.

1509
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:43,665
Every one of us was to blame.

1510
01:15:43,667 --> 01:15:47,748
(light musicbox music)

1511
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:49,248
We were ruthless with
the name-calling.

1512
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:50,956
The incessant bullying.

1513
01:15:50,958 --> 01:15:52,915
You never fought back.

1514
01:15:52,917 --> 01:15:54,165
You stayed to yourself

1515
01:15:54,167 --> 01:15:55,748
and tried to hide in
those comic books.

1516
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:59,415
- (intense music)
- (weeping)

1517
01:15:59,417 --> 01:16:00,833
We just kept after ya.

1518
01:16:02,417 --> 01:16:05,000
You just stayed in
those comic books.

1519
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:11,415
You deserve your revenge
but no one deserved to die.

1520
01:16:11,417 --> 01:16:14,792
(weeping)
Not like this.

1521
01:16:16,417 --> 01:16:18,292
Get the fuck off my crime scene.

1522
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:19,956
I can't do that.

1523
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:21,206
It's too important.

1524
01:16:21,208 --> 01:16:23,581
Just give me a few minutes.

1525
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:24,417
Talk to me.

1526
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:26,708
I think I can help.

1527
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:31,623
Everything that happened tonight

1528
01:16:31,625 --> 01:16:33,290
wasn't caused by some little boy

1529
01:16:33,292 --> 01:16:35,915
that went missing 20 years ago.

1530
01:16:35,917 --> 01:16:37,873
It was you!

1531
01:16:37,875 --> 01:16:39,373
You're responsible
for everything.

1532
01:16:39,375 --> 01:16:41,123
(weeping)

1533
01:16:41,125 --> 01:16:42,415
(door creaks open)

1534
01:16:42,417 --> 01:16:43,250
Sheriff.

1535
01:16:46,292 --> 01:16:48,625
Can I see you for a minute?

1536
01:16:56,625 --> 01:16:58,790
(weeping)

1537
01:16:58,792 --> 01:17:00,540
(door creaks open and close)

1538
01:17:00,542 --> 01:17:01,873
What is she doing here?

1539
01:17:01,875 --> 01:17:03,415
I told her she needs to leave.

1540
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:05,708
But she won't stop with
this ghost story shit.

1541
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:09,458
(haunting music)

1542
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:18,250
(ghostly whispering)

1543
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:30,208
(haunting sounds)

1544
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:35,958
(musicbox music)

1545
01:17:42,667 --> 01:17:47,333
(intense music)

1546
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:53,375
(stabbing sound)

1547
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,873
(squishy gross sounds)

1548
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:57,831
(groaning)

1549
01:17:57,833 --> 01:17:59,415
(squishy gross sounds)

1550
01:17:59,417 --> 01:18:00,540
(coughing)

1551
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:03,873
(squishy gross sounds)

1552
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:06,625
(slimy bloody sounds)

1553
01:18:12,375 --> 01:18:15,792
(door creaking open)

1554
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:34,250
What the hell just
happened here tonight?

1555
01:18:37,542 --> 01:18:38,748
(static sounds)

1556
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:41,706
This is Glen Rossi with
KVCB Channel Five News

1557
01:18:41,708 --> 01:18:45,123
reporting to you live from
Downtown Fall Creek Valley.

1558
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:46,998
We are interrupting
your regular programming

1559
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,248
for a brief moment

1560
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:50,998
to report to you this
heartbreaking story.

1561
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,581
Perhaps the biggest tragedy

1562
01:18:52,583 --> 01:18:54,581
in the history of
Fall Creek Valley.

1563
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:56,665
It is with a heavy
heart to report

1564
01:18:56,667 --> 01:19:00,581
that the bodies of eight local
residents have been found

1565
01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:02,750
at various locations
around town.

1566
01:19:03,917 --> 01:19:05,415
Here to comment is
Sheriff Ryan Leavitt

1567
01:19:05,417 --> 01:19:06,750
with more information.

1568
01:19:08,083 --> 01:19:11,915
Sheriff, what can you
reveal about these murders?

1569
01:19:11,917 --> 01:19:13,123
Well, Glen, at this time,

1570
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:15,417
all of the events
for the past 24 hours

1571
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,415
are under investigation.

1572
01:19:17,417 --> 01:19:19,790
We have seven
separate crime scenes.

1573
01:19:19,792 --> 01:19:21,248
One suspect.

1574
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:24,748
A Reggie Griffin was taken
into custody late last night.

1575
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:27,623
And you believe these murders
could possibly be linked?

1576
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:30,373
Well, we explored the
possibility of a connection

1577
01:19:30,375 --> 01:19:32,665
between several of
the murder victims

1578
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:35,208
and the disappearance
of Bobby Maxwell.

1579
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:37,625
I see.

1580
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:41,123
And is the suspect
still in custody?

1581
01:19:41,125 --> 01:19:46,125
(clears throat) Unfortunately,
Mr. Griffin died in custody

1582
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:47,667
early this morning.

1583
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:51,331
How did he die so suddenly?

1584
01:19:51,333 --> 01:19:53,248
That's under investigation.

1585
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:56,873
So you still have yet to
determine his cause of death?

1586
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:58,623
Glen, an autopsy is pending.

1587
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:00,248
Of course.

1588
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:01,498
So Sheriff, in conclusion,

1589
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,748
is there anything
you'd like to say

1590
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:05,248
to the residents of
Fall Creek Valley?

1591
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:08,498
To the citizens of Fall
Creek Valley, remain calm.

1592
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,581
We are confident we found
the person responsible

1593
01:20:10,583 --> 01:20:12,123
for these horrible crimes.

1594
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:13,498
But remain vigilant.

1595
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:16,873
If you see anything suspicious
call 911 immediately.

1596
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:19,498
In essence, if you see
something, say something.

1597
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,456
In memorium of the victims
of this terrible tragedy,

1598
01:20:22,458 --> 01:20:24,331
there will be a candlelight
vigil held tonight

1599
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:27,915
at sunset at the Fall Creek
Valley Towne Center Hall.

1600
01:20:27,917 --> 01:20:30,331
We will be bringing you
more updates and information

1601
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:32,123
as it becomes available.

1602
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:35,665
This night will
forever live in infamy

1603
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:38,500
as the night of the Fall
Creek Valley Massacre.

1604
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:41,333
(car door closing)

1605
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:43,583
(keys jangling)

1606
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:46,873
(on radio) Waaaooo!

1607
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:50,540
That was an amazing,
mind-altering Halloween night

1608
01:20:50,542 --> 01:20:52,040
for the ages!

1609
01:20:52,042 --> 01:20:54,373
The ghosts and ghouls
rocked the halls

1610
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:57,165
as the demons and witches
danced with the dead.

1611
01:20:57,167 --> 01:21:01,040
Zombies and werewolves feasted
on the flesh of the innocent

1612
01:21:01,042 --> 01:21:04,331
and the Harvest Moon
dripped with blood.

1613
01:21:04,333 --> 01:21:07,081
20 years of throwing this party.

1614
01:21:07,083 --> 01:21:10,040
And without patting myself on
the back too much, my freaks,

1615
01:21:10,042 --> 01:21:12,958
I think yours truly
raised the bar yet again.

1616
01:21:14,042 --> 01:21:16,040
It was one wild and crazy night.

1617
01:21:16,042 --> 01:21:18,748
I got a call that my
twin brother is here.

1618
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:19,625
Reggie Griffin?

1619
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:22,206
Alex?

1620
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:23,748
Alex Griffin?

1621
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:27,042
(light musicbox music)

1622
01:21:28,042 --> 01:21:29,415
Your nose is bleeding.

1623
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:30,998
(on radio) Well, my Rockodiles,

1624
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,790
don't fear the reaper just yet

1625
01:21:32,792 --> 01:21:35,581
'cause even though
tonight's festivities

1626
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:37,123
have reached the end,

1627
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:39,248
there's always next year.

1628
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:40,248
(echoing whispering)

1629
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:42,165
Bloody Bobby!

1630
01:21:42,167 --> 01:21:43,250
Bloody Bobby!

1631
01:21:45,042 --> 01:21:46,083
Bloody Bobby!

1632
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:48,625
Bloody Bobby!

1633
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,083
Bloody Bobby!

1634
01:21:51,917 --> 01:21:53,000
Bloody Bobby!

1635
01:21:55,125 --> 01:21:56,250
Bloody Bobby!
