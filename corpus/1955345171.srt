1
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:30,539
<i>Henry Joseph Church
could have been...</i>

2
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:32,871
<i>Anything he wanted to be.</i>

3
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:35,434
<i>He chose to cook.</i>

4
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,573
<i>The key, he said, jazz.</i>

5
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,652
Mama, wake up, wake up.

6
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,354
Baby, baby, what is it?

7
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,489
There's a black man
in our kitchen cooking eggs.

8
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,889
Baby, that's okay.

9
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:34,632
It's Mr. Church, our new cook.

10
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:35,968
- New cook?
- Mm-hmm.

11
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,638
We never had an old cook.

12
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:40,700
You know what?
Mama just needs a tiny bit more rest.

13
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:44,680
I'll... go introduce yourself.
I'll be there soon.

14
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:53,389
<i>Mr. Church used to work
for Richard Cannon...</i>

15
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,618
<i>Who was mama's lover.</i>

16
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:56,591
<i>But He wasn't my daddy.</i>

17
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:58,787
<i>When mama found out
Richard was married...</i>

18
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:00,853
<i>She ended it,
though she still loved him.</i>

19
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,261
Morning, baby.

20
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:03,663
<i>When Richard was sick...</i>

21
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,362
<i>The last thing he said to mama was</i>
"I'll <i>care for you...</i>

22
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,029
<i>Until my dying day and beyond.”</i>

23
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:10,382
- good morning, Mr. Church.
- Oh, good morning, ma'am.

24
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:12,670
<i>I guess Mr. Church
was the ”beyond” part.</i>

25
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:14,301
I see you met Charlie.

26
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:15,708
Well, not officially.

27
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,975
Oh, well, Charlie,
where's your manners?

28
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:19,981
Good morning, Charlotte.
My name's Mr. Church.

29
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,813
- How are you?
- Fine.

30
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:24,547
Wow, this looks delicious.
Thank you, Mr. Church.

31
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:26,954
You are most welcome, ma'am.

32
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,424
Come on, baby.
Eat up.

33
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,584
I want apple Jacks.

34
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:31,593
- Charlie!
- What are apple Jacks'?

35
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:33,356
Well, it's a cereal.

36
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:35,295
It tastes like apples.

37
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:36,856
Well, and sugar, mainly.

38
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:38,992
You've never heard of apple Jacks'?

39
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:40,679
- Hey, don't be rude.
- I can make the child...

40
00:03:40,703 --> 00:03:42,047
Some apple Jacks
if that's what she wants...

41
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:43,971
It's already made.
It comes in a box.

42
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,508
Add milk and you're done.

43
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:48,344
She doesn't need it.

44
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:49,622
Well, she got
to eat something, ma'am.

45
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,457
You have made an incredible meal.
Charlie, eat.

46
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,506
What is this?

47
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,381
You never heard of grits?

48
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:58,450
There are a lot of secrets
in my grits.

49
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,853
This is delicious.
You got to try some, sweetie.

50
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:06,726
Charlotte Marie Brooks,
you sit your butt down right now.

51
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,522
I'm going to count to three, okay?

52
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,000
One... Two...

53
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:13,469
Mr. Church, excuse me.

54
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,595
I want cereal!

55
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:18,466
You're embarrassing me.

56
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,940
Why is he here?

57
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,001
I don't know.
Because Richard wanted it this way.

58
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,639
- And I want apple Jacks.
- Charlie...

59
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:27,479
What times does he go home?

60
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,042
I guess when he's done.

61
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:31,382
- When is he done?
- When we're done.

62
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:32,888
Well, we're done.

63
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:34,515
Oh, Charlie, please.

64
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:36,491
It makes no sense.

65
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:38,027
It's what Richard wanted.

66
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:40,826
Who cares what he wanted?
He's dead.

67
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,356
- Morning, Gibby.
- Morning, dear. Charlie.

68
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,629
Morning, Gibby.

69
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,033
How are you two this morning?

70
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,936
We're fine.

71
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:50,097
We have a cook.

72
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,501
That's nice, dear.

73
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:53,940
Here, take this.

74
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,411
You drink coffee all day.
I eat apple Jacks.

75
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,919
- We don't need a cook.
- Well, Richard seems to think we did.

76
00:04:58,948 --> 00:05:00,575
If Richard really cared about you...

77
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,811
He would have married you.

78
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,919
Mr. Church won't be staying.

79
00:05:05,955 --> 00:05:08,822
I'm sure he's already realized
what a mistake all this is.

80
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,860
Come on, Charlie.
We gotta move.

81
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,554
Love you.

82
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,436
<i>If was always hard
to stay mad a1' mama.</i>

83
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:25,475
<i>She was foo nice,
and far foo beautiful.</i>

84
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,471
<i>I was always looking...</i>

85
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:33,846
<i>Trying to find someone
more beautiful than my mama.</i>

86
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:34,941
<i>But I never could.</i>

87
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:38,950
<i>And out of everyone
in the whole wide world...</i>

88
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:41,923
<i>She loved me most.</i>

89
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:46,755
Hey, Mr. Church,
could I have a word with you?

90
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:48,957
Oh, man.
I'm going to need to go to the market.

91
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:50,523
Yeah, well, it's about all that.

92
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,645
Yeah, I brought some groceries
with me today, ma'am...

93
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:55,114
But no offense, all you got in here
is some condiments and stuff.

94
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:56,572
There's nothing to spread them on.

95
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,006
I suppose I haven't been
to the store in a while.

96
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:01,009
Could we just hold off
on that for a second?

97
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:02,821
I wanted to wait
till Charlie was at school...

98
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:04,823
- Before speaking with you...
- Ma'am, you're shivering.

99
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:07,441
Yeah, I forgot my jacket.
It's kind of chilly out.

100
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:09,576
Maybe you want to put on
a sweater or something.

101
00:06:09,652 --> 00:06:10,652
Yeah, I will. I just...

102
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:18,719
'cause you don't want
to get sick, ma'am.

103
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:20,661
He told you.

104
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,164
Yes, ma'am.

105
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,196
What'd he say?

106
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,937
That you have a cancer
in your breast...

107
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:30,871
And that you're dying, ma'am.

108
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:35,636
Did he tell you
how long I have'?

109
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:37,671
Six months, ma'am.

110
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:40,978
Mr. Church, we're talking
about my breast and dying.

111
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,213
You can drop
the "ma'am" stuff, okay?

112
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,818
Because it's Marie.

113
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:47,549
You really think
you should be smoking...

114
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:48,784
In your condition, ma'am?

115
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:51,691
Absolutely.

116
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:55,756
How'd you do on your English test?

117
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,266
Hmm, I think I failed.

118
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:06,006
Good morning, miss Samuels.
Good morning, miss Brooks.

119
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:07,075
How are you this morning?

120
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:08,907
Oh, well, we have a cook.

121
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:10,970
He's black, he makes grits
with secrets...

122
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:13,243
And he's hanging out in our kitchen.

123
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:27,194
So, what kind of a deal
did Richard make with you?

124
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,699
I was just asked to cook
for you and your child...

125
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:31,928
Till you passed on, ma'am.

126
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:36,735
And certainly you're getting
something out of this.

127
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:39,173
Well, Mr. Cannon guaranteed me
a lifetime salary...

128
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:40,242
If I kept my word.

129
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,137
Not bad.

130
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,976
Total financial security...

131
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,676
In exchange
for six months of meals.

132
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,812
So, you got yourself
a pretty good deal, Mr. Church.

133
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:55,280
Yes, ma'am.

134
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,549
Come on.

135
00:07:58,628 --> 00:07:59,686
Hey, Charlie.

136
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:03,827
<i>Owen Baxter was by far...</i>

137
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,561
<i>The most gorgeous 10-year-old boy...</i>

138
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:08,866
<i>That ever breathed on this
or any other planet.</i>

139
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:11,633
<i>I, on the other hand...</i>

140
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:14,005
<i>Was about the most awkward
10-year-old girl...</i>

141
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,637
<i>On this or any other planet.</i>

142
00:08:16,712 --> 00:08:18,806
Come on, Owen.

143
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:21,773
What is it?

144
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:23,319
Who knows?

145
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:26,921
Look at you...

146
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:29,048
Already bringing
fancy sandwiches to lunch...

147
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,184
Miss I have a cook Brooks.

148
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,125
Can I come see him?

149
00:08:32,195 --> 00:08:34,926
I told you, he's leaving.

150
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:36,328
Probably gone already.

151
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,330
Oh, if you don't want him, I do.

152
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,731
<i>Our private school took
a few charity cases a year.</i>

153
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:44,967
<i>The year I turned five, it was me...</i>

154
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:48,341
<i>And poppy Samuels,
my one and only friend.</i>

155
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,739
<i>She lived with her sister
because both of her folks...</i>

156
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:53,282
<i>Were serving time in prison
for a robbery gone wrong.</i>

157
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:56,649
<i>And even with that,
she was more popular than me.</i>

158
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:58,016
Tell you something, Charlie...

159
00:08:58,054 --> 00:08:59,715
It's not every day you get a cook.

160
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,109
It might be nice having a man
around to help your mama out.

161
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:04,149
We've always done fine.

162
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:06,753
We don't need a man,
and we sure as hell don't need a cook.

163
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:09,890
My sister says every woman
needs a man.

164
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,799
Sometimes more than one.

165
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:14,359
Where'd you get all that?

166
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,038
Stole it from my sister's dresser.

167
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:19,973
Stealing's the one thing
us Samuels are good at.

168
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:24,640
Yeah?

169
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,943
Excuse me, ma'am.

170
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,779
I'm about to head out to the market.

171
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,184
Okay. Um...

172
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:32,381
We shop at Gordon's.
Is that all right'?

173
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,249
Oh, yeah, that's fine.
Yeah, yeah.

174
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,918
You know, Mr. Church,
if we're going to do this...

175
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,371
Let me at least give you some money.

176
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:41,386
I've only got $12, but...

177
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,132
Oh, ma'am, don't worry about that.

178
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:46,999
Mr. Cannon opened up an account
for me to draw off...

179
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:48,127
For marketing and such.

180
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:49,797
"And such?"

181
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,401
Well, your medical bills
and rent and medicine.

182
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,702
That's all taken care of,
courtesy of Mr. Cannon...

183
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:00,238
For the next six months.

184
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:02,250
And what, in his estimation...

185
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:03,808
Did six months of life come to?

186
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,218
Beg your pardon, ma'am?

187
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:06,847
Never mind.

188
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:08,118
You know what?

189
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,818
At least take some coupons, you know?

190
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,850
I'm not completely helpless.

191
00:10:11,928 --> 00:10:13,968
- It couldn't hurt.
- Yeah, it couldn't hurt at all.

192
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,691
All right. Okay.

193
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:18,029
Oh, Mr. Church, um...

194
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,099
Charlie doesn't know that I'm sick...

195
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:24,105
And I'd like to keep it that way.

196
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,837
Oh. As you wish, ma'am.

197
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:30,777
I'll be back shortly, all right'?

198
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:47,990
All right, $43.32, sir.

199
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,294
Hey, wait a minute, you know,
I forgot all about these.

200
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:52,494
Great. Let's see.

201
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:55,430
$37.83, sir.

202
00:10:55,504 --> 00:10:57,871
- So I saved about $6 there?
- Yes, sir.

203
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,341
That's not bad.

204
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,740
No, sir.

205
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,379
Hey, Charlie.

206
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:11,181
Hi, Larson.

207
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,484
<i>Eddie Larson.</i>

208
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,249
<i>Forced to ride public transportation
for the rest of his life.</i>

209
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:19,522
<i>Just one week after getting
his driver's license...</i>

210
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:21,923
<i>He got drunk and crashed
his Chevy Camaro...</i>

211
00:11:21,998 --> 00:11:24,023
<i>Info the living room
of Mr. and Mrs. Howard...</i>

212
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,761
<i>Killing their 4-year-old son.</i>

213
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:29,097
<i>Spent three years in
juvenile penitentiary...</i>

214
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:32,106
<i>And no doubt the rest of his life
in the worst hell of all...</i>

215
00:11:32,174 --> 00:11:33,835
<i>The one between the eyes.</i>

216
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:36,378
How's... How's school, Charlie?

217
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,072
We have a cook.

218
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:40,172
What, at the school?

219
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:41,445
At my house.

220
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:44,179
Oh, yeah. That's far out.

221
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:47,484
Mama's going to tell him to leave.

222
00:11:47,556 --> 00:11:49,320
Why?
Who wouldn't want a cook?

223
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:57,461
Hi, mama.

224
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,228
So, how was work today?

225
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,929
Good.

226
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:02,528
I saw miss Carol's baby.

227
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,204
Hey, gorgeous.

228
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,004
Can't you see I'm with my child?

229
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,007
I saw miss Carol's baby,
and I finally got him...

230
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,208
To latch on for feeding.

231
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:14,459
You know, holding those babies...

232
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,952
It always makes me think
of the first time I held you.

233
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,546
Even if I was an accident.

234
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,291
Why on earth would you say that?

235
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:24,554
Your daddy was the accident.

236
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:28,422
You, you're my miracle.

237
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,124
How much do I love you?

238
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:32,258
So much.

239
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,064
So much.

240
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:38,433
So, how did the cook
take the news he was fired?

241
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,532
Oh, ma'am, I hope you don't mind.

242
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:42,577
I bring books with me
every place I go...

243
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,556
And I noticed that your shelf
was kind of empty.

244
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,173
He's still here, mama.

245
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:48,608
- Why is he still here?
- Charlie, we'll discuss this later.

246
00:12:49,618 --> 00:12:52,849
That's great.
Cookbooks, right'?

247
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:54,066
Oh, no, no, ma'am.
Not cookbooks.

248
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,300
I never read books about cooking.

249
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:57,588
These are mostly novels
and plays and, you know...

250
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,261
About people like Capote
and Shakespeare.

251
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:02,855
- Wow.
- And Greeks and Agatha Christie.

252
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:05,026
And here's one I think
the girl might like.

253
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:07,593
Autobiography of Shirley temple.

254
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:10,133
<i>Good ship lollipop.</i>

255
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,571
I hate reading.

256
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,436
Charlie!

257
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,907
Oh, that is a shame,
because there's nothing like...

258
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:15,637
A really good story.

259
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:18,073
- Keep your stupid books.
- Hey, that's enough.

260
00:13:18,147 --> 00:13:19,410
No, that's okay, ma'am.

261
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:21,974
But, listen, if you do ever want
to read one of these books...

262
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,491
You're going to have
to check it out.

263
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,045
- What, like a library?
- Exactly like a library.

264
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:27,599
Made a card up for you
and everything.

265
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:30,001
And ma'am, you feel free. Whenever
you want, you can read these books.

266
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:31,036
And if you like, I'll bring more.

267
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,052
A house could always
use books, right'?

268
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,629
I'm sorry, Mr. Church.

269
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:39,901
She'll get used to it.

270
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:42,495
She's just a child.
She doesn't understand.

271
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,096
Oh, sure, ma'am.

272
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,084
Look, I'll have dinner ready
for you and the child...

273
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:48,708
About 6:00 tonight, then after that,
I'll take care of the dishes.

274
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:50,322
Then I'll take my leave
for the evening.

275
00:13:50,346 --> 00:13:52,644
6:00 it is.
Thank you, Mr. Church.

276
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,246
You're most welcome.

277
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:03,492
Dinnertime.

278
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,459
I'm not hungry.

279
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:07,018
Baby...

280
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:12,261
This is the way it's going to be.

281
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:17,033
So, I suggest you find a way
to stop complaining...

282
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,938
And start enjoying the food.

283
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:24,374
Mr. Church asked me
to give you this.

284
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:31,211
<i>Complaining wasn't easy to stop.</i>

285
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:32,414
Oh.

286
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:34,286
<i>Enjoying the food was a breeze.</i>

287
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:35,619
- Wow.
- Enjoy.

288
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:38,285
<i>But I wasn't about to let
Mr. Church or mama know it.</i>

289
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,227
Charlie, come on, eat it.

290
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:45,734
<i>As far as they were concerned,
every bite was torture for me.</i>

291
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:51,667
<i>Secretly, I couldn't wait to taste
what was coming next.</i>

292
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,301
<i>And what came next was always
something magnificent.</i>

293
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,511
<i>If was like a party every night.</i>

294
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:00,982
<i>Every morning.</i>

295
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:20,031
<i>If was like a party every afternoon.</i>

296
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:26,533
<i>I finally let poppy
over to meet Mr. Church.</i>

297
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:28,737
<i>Once I did,
I couldn't get rid of her.</i>

298
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,139
Mr. Church,
this is the best lemonade...

299
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:32,476
I've ever tasted.

300
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:35,347
The secret to that,
my dear, is the licorice.

301
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:39,081
You and your secrets, Mr. Church.

302
00:15:39,154 --> 00:15:41,145
My sister loved
the banana bread you made.

303
00:15:41,223 --> 00:15:42,520
Oh, thank you, poppy.

304
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,491
"My sister loved
the banana bread you made."

305
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,119
She did.

306
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,567
<i>And in the morning,
Mr. Church was in the kitchen...</i>

307
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:57,368
<i>Long before I was awake.</i>

308
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,340
<i>The smells of cooking
were like my alarm clock.</i>

309
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:09,175
<i>Mr. Church could make or bake
anything you wanted...</i>

310
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:11,720
<i>And even things
you didn't know you wanted...</i>

311
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:14,256
<i>Until after you fasted them.</i>

312
00:16:14,323 --> 00:16:16,234
<i>F never once saw Mr. Church
use a measuring roof...</i>

313
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:18,158
<i>Or any fancy utensil.</i>

314
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,286
<i>Just his hands, fork, and knife.</i>

315
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:32,070
Come on, baby.
We'll be late for the bus.

316
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:42,482
Oh, I've got a winner.

317
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:45,077
This is the toothpaste
that Charlie likes.

318
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:48,518
So, I finished this one.

319
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:53,091
I still don't see why
they couldn't be together.

320
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:55,426
Next time, I want a story
that's not going to make me...

321
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:56,692
Cry my eyes out.

322
00:16:56,765 --> 00:17:00,793
Some writers ain't happy
till they made the reader cry.

323
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:03,804
And some readers
ain't happy till they do.

324
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:16,249
<i>I'd watch Mr. Church leave...</i>

325
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:18,582
<i>Knowing that in just a few short hours...</i>

326
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:22,147
<i>He'd return with bags and bags
of goodies to explore.</i>

327
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,402
- Whoa!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

328
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,816
- Oh, baby!
- I got her. I got you, I got you.

329
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,400
- Are you okay?
- I got you. She's okay.

330
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:41,252
- Oh, my god. Thank you.
- Let me get this stuff here.

331
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:42,387
- Thank you, Mr. Church.
- It's okay.

332
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:43,810
Yeah, there's glass everywhere.

333
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:45,323
- Watch where you're stepping.
- Let me...

334
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:46,280
Watch out.
No, I got it.

335
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:47,679
I got this, ma'am.

336
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,548
Let me...
I'll take care of this.

337
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:50,813
Okay, thank you.

338
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:52,912
What child would like
to get cut'?

339
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:09,430
Mr. Church.

340
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:12,270
I'd like to check out
a book, if that's okay.

341
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:18,941
How about if I make
some suggestions.

342
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:32,519
Now, this is kind of long,
but it's worth the journey.

343
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:34,426
I read it a couple of times myself...

344
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:36,328
So you don't got
to be gentle with it.

345
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:39,459
Books was meant to be broken in.

346
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:40,935
Good night, my dear.

347
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:11,326
<i>And through it all...</i>

348
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,234
<i>I never knew about the promise
Mr. Church made to Richard.</i>

349
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:17,432
<i>I never knew mama was dying.</i>

350
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:21,409
<i>I never knew anything
until much, much later.</i>

351
00:19:21,477 --> 00:19:23,639
<i>The only thing I knew
at fen years old...</i>

352
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:25,237
<i>Was that one morning
I woke up...</i>

353
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,441
<i>And we had a cook.</i>

354
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:27,949
<i>And one other thing.</i>

355
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:30,951
<i>He was to be gone in six months.</i>

356
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:32,509
<i>But Six months...</i>

357
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,448
<i>turned into six years.</i>

358
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:38,653
<i>Turns out mama was a miracle.</i>

359
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:40,695
<i>She boxed that mean, old cancer...</i>

360
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,789
<i>Every day, giving it lefts,
rights, uppercuts.</i>

361
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:46,301
<i>And all the while,
I never knew she was is the ring.</i>

362
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:47,665
Hey, Charlie.

363
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:48,862
Hi.
Owen, is it true...

364
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,577
That Stevie hasn't
asked me to the prom...

365
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,886
Because his folks don't approve?

366
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,271
Don't know anything about it.

367
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:56,437
I heard he's taking Nora Williams
because she's a notorious virgin.

368
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:02,415
Ugh, I told my sister
never to hunk.

369
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:04,714
She just can't help
embarrassing me.

370
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:05,913
I can't wait till I'm 18.

371
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:08,548
I can get away
from this stinking place.

372
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,951
Walk you to the bus?

373
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:15,589
Sure.

374
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:21,502
Are you really
going to read all these?

375
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,699
I already did.
Just returning them.

376
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,474
How's your mom doing?

377
00:20:28,544 --> 00:20:30,342
She's fine.

378
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,644
Coming to the game tonight?

379
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:36,980
I can't really go out at night.

380
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:38,713
Not ever?

381
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:42,418
Not even for, say, prom?

382
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,023
Would you go with me, Charlie?

383
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:52,761
I... I got to go.

384
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,463
I... I... I got to go.

385
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,869
I'll take that as a maybe.

386
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,666
<i>Every time I walked in that room...</i>

387
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:37,769
<i>I held my breath
so I could listen for hers.</i>

388
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:39,804
<i>Hoping it would still be there.</i>

389
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,579
<i>Sometimes it was so soft...</i>

390
00:21:47,656 --> 00:21:49,868
<i>I had to climb onto the bed
and put my ear up to her mouth...</i>

391
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,587
<i>Just to make sure.</i>

392
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,560
<i>Other times,
it was so heavy with struggle...</i>

393
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:57,395
<i>That I had to back as far away
as I could just to stand it.</i>

394
00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:58,934
<i>And other times...</i>

395
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:01,732
<i>If was all mama.</i>

396
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,737
There she is.

397
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:08,799
I have a plate of cheese and grapes
for you in the icebox.

398
00:22:10,646 --> 00:22:12,136
How's she doing?

399
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,973
She had a good day.

400
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:16,609
And you, my dear,
have come at the perfect time.

401
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:18,676
You need to wake her
so she can eat.

402
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,085
I want you to take this to her.

403
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:21,680
I have homework.

404
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:23,714
Oh, come on, Charlotte.
She had a good day.

405
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:26,124
She's still going to die, Mr. Church.

406
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:39,735
Hey, you're awake.

407
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:42,106
I thought I heard Charlie.

408
00:22:42,144 --> 00:22:43,908
Did she come right up from school?

409
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:45,219
Yeah, she's doing her homework.

410
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,006
She didn't want to disturb you.

411
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,144
You're a terrible liar, Mr. Church.

412
00:22:51,219 --> 00:22:53,745
You want some company?

413
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:10,033
"She always accompanied him
to the first step of the stairs.

414
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:12,130
"When his horse had not yet
been brought around...

415
00:23:12,174 --> 00:23:13,539
"She'd stayed there.

416
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:16,009
"They had said good-bye.

417
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:18,672
"There was no more talking.

418
00:23:18,747 --> 00:23:20,091
"The open air
wrapped around her...

419
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:23,551
"Playing with the soft down
on the back of her neck...

420
00:23:23,618 --> 00:23:25,086
"Or blew to and fro on her hips...

421
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,020
"The aprons strings
that fluttered like streamers.

422
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,152
Love, she thought,
must come suddenly..."

423
00:23:32,227 --> 00:23:34,662
<i>My mama had been the sun to me.</i>

424
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,165
<i>I basked in her warmth.</i>

425
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:40,794
<i>I remember wanting to wake up
in the morning just to see her.</i>

426
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:42,633
<i>But Now that sun was on fire...</i>

427
00:23:42,704 --> 00:23:46,106
<i>Seemed to burn
everything in sight.</i>

428
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,666
<i>If! Got foo close, my skin stung.</i>

429
00:23:49,644 --> 00:23:51,134
<i>But Mr. Church...</i>

430
00:23:51,213 --> 00:23:52,942
<i>He could walk
right through her Blaze...</i>

431
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,983
<i>Without so much as a singe.</i>

432
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,745
<i>He was like the moon...</i>

433
00:23:56,818 --> 00:23:59,913
<i>Cool, calm, and always there.</i>

434
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:02,753
<i>So, I learned to turn away
from the sun...</i>

435
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:04,724
<i>And face the moon.</i>

436
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:12,997
This is excellent work.

437
00:24:13,068 --> 00:24:15,833
The Bronte sisters
would have been proud.

438
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,071
It was visiting day at the prison.

439
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,839
I don't know why
they force poppy to go.

440
00:24:23,912 --> 00:24:25,539
She just ends up smoking...

441
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,571
With a bunch of locked-up creeps
staring at her.

442
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:30,243
Hey, they're her parents, Charlotte.

443
00:24:32,854 --> 00:24:34,948
- Apple?
- Of course.

444
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,151
Oh...

445
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,988
Larson told me
to let you know...

446
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,325
That his group of drunks
loved the pie you donated.

447
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:43,564
Have you seen that place?

448
00:24:43,598 --> 00:24:45,088
The thing's pretty dreary.

449
00:24:45,133 --> 00:24:47,966
Well, I guess being a drunk
is dreary, huh?

450
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,003
Hey, your mom's going to need
a bath tonight.

451
00:24:55,811 --> 00:24:58,212
<i>Mr. Church stopped smoking
in the house...</i>

452
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,840
<i>Once mama passed
the six-month mark.</i>

453
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,884
<i>Guess he realized
she wasn't going anywhere...</i>

454
00:25:02,951 --> 00:25:04,680
<i>And he didn't want
to hurry her along.</i>

455
00:25:11,726 --> 00:25:13,319
<i>We each had our duties.</i>

456
00:25:14,362 --> 00:25:15,852
<i>Mr. Church fed mama...</i>

457
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,127
<i>Gave her medicine,
took her blood pressure...</i>

458
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,135
<i>Temperature, held pots
under her face when she threw up.</i>

459
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:23,763
<i>Carried her to and from the bathroom
when she needed to go.</i>

460
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,275
<i>And with all that,
he still called her ma'am.</i>

461
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:30,175
<i>And she still called him
Mr. Church.</i>

462
00:25:31,646 --> 00:25:34,638
<i>My one and only job
was to bathe mama.</i>

463
00:25:36,918 --> 00:25:38,613
<i>And I hated it.</i>

464
00:25:43,391 --> 00:25:46,019
How was...
How was school today?

465
00:25:46,061 --> 00:25:48,223
School is school.

466
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:51,288
Did you... did you hear
from any more colleges?

467
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,168
I got accepted
to Boston university.

468
00:25:55,237 --> 00:25:59,674
Charlie, that's what you wanted.

469
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:01,733
I'm so proud of you.

470
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,642
I can't afford a university, mama.

471
00:26:03,712 --> 00:26:05,152
I'll be going local and you know it.

472
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,012
You applied for a scholarship.

473
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:15,918
Mr. Church said that Owen Baxter
asked you to the prom.

474
00:26:15,957 --> 00:26:17,891
News like that...

475
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:20,428
I'd like to have heard it
from you.

476
00:26:20,695 --> 00:26:22,356
Forward.
It's no big deal.

477
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,331
No big deal?

478
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,095
Just a lame prom.

479
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,799
No, baby, it's colorful and exciting.

480
00:26:30,872 --> 00:26:32,183
You get to see all your friends...

481
00:26:32,207 --> 00:26:33,868
Dressed up...

482
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:34,966
Dancing with boys...

483
00:26:35,043 --> 00:26:36,323
They never even knew liked them.

484
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:39,278
Go back.
It's one of the biggest nights...

485
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,146
Of a girl's life.

486
00:26:42,217 --> 00:26:43,707
Thanks.

487
00:26:44,786 --> 00:26:47,847
- Frankie liner.
- What?

488
00:26:47,923 --> 00:26:51,018
He was my...
My... my prom date.

489
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:54,824
Poor Frankie, his hands
were sweating all night long.

490
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,992
But, boy, could he dance.

491
00:26:58,066 --> 00:26:59,898
You'll need a dress
and some new shoes.

492
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,164
Not if I don't go.

493
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:04,968
Charlie, don't skip your prom.

494
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,407
Why do you care?
You won't be around to see it anyway.

495
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:09,910
Don't say things like that.

496
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,243
Okay?

497
00:27:13,315 --> 00:27:15,249
Because I...

498
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:17,752
Have hung on
for five years longer...

499
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:19,913
Than any of those
damn doctors said I would.

500
00:27:19,988 --> 00:27:22,787
What's a couple more weeks
till your prom?

501
00:27:22,857 --> 00:27:24,018
Neck.

502
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:26,322
Charlie, listen to me, okay?

503
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,920
I'm going to make you a promise...

504
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:31,967
And you know
I never break my promises.

505
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:35,298
If you say yes to Owen...

506
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,236
And get yourself a dress...

507
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,334
And you go to that lame prom...

508
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,343
I'll be hereto see it.

509
00:27:47,315 --> 00:27:51,752
How'd we get such
beautiful hair, huh?

510
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:55,020
Okay.

511
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:56,182
We're done.

512
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,191
- Charlie...
- We're done.

513
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,970
- Mr. Church. Mr. Church.
- No, Charlie, wait!

514
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:00,962
Goddamn it!

515
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:03,327
I am angry too.

516
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:07,363
You give birth to this tiny,
innocent, little thing...

517
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,834
And you think, "my god...

518
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:10,496
Oh, my god,
help me protect her."

519
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:14,003
And that is what you spend
every waking moment doing.

520
00:28:14,142 --> 00:28:18,010
And then one day you wake up
and you've got cancer.

521
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,411
And you realize, "my god...

522
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,148
"Oh, my god...

523
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,917
"What she will need
the most protection from...

524
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,828
Is your own life
slipping away from her."

525
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:39,330
But you love her so much.

526
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:44,095
And you just want
to smother her...

527
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:47,506
With love and hugs and words...

528
00:28:47,575 --> 00:28:49,441
With every moment you've got left.

529
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:51,809
And a hug there was.

530
00:28:51,846 --> 00:28:53,473
Charlie.

531
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:04,150
Okay.

532
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:10,021
She'll remember the love,
won't she, Mr. Church...

533
00:29:10,098 --> 00:29:10,963
Not the pain?

534
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:14,058
Yes, ma'am.
She will.

535
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:29,543
<i>It's an awful feeling
to love someone so much...</i>

536
00:29:29,617 --> 00:29:33,554
<i>That you absolutely hate them
for leaving you.</i>

537
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:36,215
<i>Even before they've gone.</i>

538
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:47,197
Hey, Dr. green stopped by
with some medicine for your mother...

539
00:29:47,268 --> 00:29:49,236
To help her sleep better tonight.

540
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:52,465
You going home?

541
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,271
Yup, I am gone for the day.

542
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,487
Check out another book
before you go?

543
00:30:15,663 --> 00:30:17,961
<i>Tess of the D'urbervilles.
You read</i> this?

544
00:30:18,032 --> 00:30:21,297
Aren't you the one who said it's good
to read a book more than once?

545
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:23,929
All <i>right, well then,
Tess of the D'urbervilles it is.</i>

546
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,939
Is there something else?

547
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,204
Why don't you ever
tell me where you live?

548
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,940
Where do you go
when you aren't with us'?

549
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:34,458
Because what I do
with my own personal time...

550
00:30:34,482 --> 00:30:35,540
Is my business, Charlotte.

551
00:30:35,617 --> 00:30:37,915
You know everything about me,
so just tell me something.

552
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:39,385
It's late, Charlie.

553
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:41,980
- Please.
- Hey, I said it's late.

554
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,294
I like ice cream.

555
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:53,197
What kind?

556
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,066
Butter pecan.

557
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:57,104
- Favorite color?
- Brown.

558
00:30:57,172 --> 00:30:58,298
Movie?

559
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:01,699
<i>The Maltese falcon.</i>

560
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,541
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Okay, now that's enough.

561
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,637
All right, just tell me
what your house looks like.

562
00:31:06,714 --> 00:31:08,341
Or tell me
who your best friend is.

563
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:11,215
- Come on, just tell me...
- Hey, I said enough!

564
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,948
Don't you know when to back off?

565
00:31:13,988 --> 00:31:15,285
Enough.

566
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,657
You've never raised
your voice to me.

567
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:26,125
I'm sorry about that.

568
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:28,067
I just...

569
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,413
I just want to know more
about you.

570
00:31:29,437 --> 00:31:32,532
I know you want.
I know.

571
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:38,239
My dear, you have me
from morning until night.

572
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:42,011
And what I do
when I leave here is my time.

573
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:44,677
For me.

574
00:31:44,752 --> 00:31:46,618
Don't take that away.

575
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:53,387
<i>Tess of the D'urbervilles.</i>

576
00:31:53,428 --> 00:31:55,624
I've actually read it three times.

577
00:31:58,233 --> 00:31:59,632
Good night.

578
00:32:22,757 --> 00:32:24,623
That one.

579
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,660
Yeah?

580
00:32:26,728 --> 00:32:28,321
Sure.

581
00:32:45,446 --> 00:32:47,312
Babe.

582
00:33:30,224 --> 00:33:32,818
I... I think the neckline
could be a little lower.

583
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,496
Well, she's going to a prom,
not the discotheque.

584
00:33:36,564 --> 00:33:39,499
Don't be such a square,
Mr. Church. Lower.

585
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:41,501
<i>The prom suddenly became...</i>

586
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:43,129
<i>The most important event
of our lives.</i>

587
00:33:43,204 --> 00:33:44,365
<i>And for the first time...</i>

588
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,669
<i>I believed that mama
was going to live forever...</i>

589
00:33:46,741 --> 00:33:49,108
<i>That she truly was a miracle.</i>

590
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:51,407
<i>And those doctors
had been wrong all along.</i>

591
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:53,641
Hey, you know,
this has an elegance to it...

592
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:55,240
That this just doesn't have.

593
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,393
This kind of <i>says,</i>
"let's dance."

594
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:58,112
Let's dance.
That's the point.

595
00:33:58,152 --> 00:33:59,697
- All right, it's your prom.
- The Dancy look.

596
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:02,199
- I like the Dancy look.
- All right, we're going with the Dancy look.

597
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:03,247
Okay.

598
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,408
Oh, my god.

599
00:34:26,514 --> 00:34:29,484
You are so beautiful.

600
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,611
Tell her.
Tell her, Mr. Church.

601
00:34:32,687 --> 00:34:35,213
Oh, a true vision, my dear.

602
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:37,690
The dress is perfect.

603
00:34:37,725 --> 00:34:40,319
Come and stand next to your mother
so I can get a picture.

604
00:34:40,395 --> 00:34:41,726
Well, put it on a timer.

605
00:34:41,796 --> 00:34:43,407
- We need a picture of the three of us.
- Yeah!

606
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:44,762
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Come on now.

607
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:45,765
Yeah, we do.

608
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,733
- Please?
- We need one of the whole family.

609
00:34:47,802 --> 00:34:49,566
Mr. Church...

610
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:52,164
Come on, sit.

611
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,867
Okay.

612
00:35:05,253 --> 00:35:08,587
Okay, I want to make a toast.

613
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:19,425
To the most beautiful girl
in the world.

614
00:35:20,568 --> 00:35:22,195
Yes.

615
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:28,704
It pops in my mouth.

616
00:35:38,286 --> 00:35:40,277
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

617
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:45,949
Wow.

618
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,423
Hi.

619
00:36:09,317 --> 00:36:10,910
More punch?

620
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:12,919
- Still have some.
- Right.

621
00:36:19,393 --> 00:36:21,555
Here's the thing.

622
00:36:21,629 --> 00:36:23,791
I can't dance.

623
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:24,889
Not at all.

624
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:27,799
That's okay.
We don't have to dance.

625
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,668
Hell, it can't be harder
than basketball.

626
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:37,872
Come on.

627
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:22,512
You're still here.

628
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,718
Oh, ma'am, you shouldn't be up.

629
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:25,918
I couldn't sleep.

630
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,690
I... I heard the music.

631
00:37:28,763 --> 00:37:30,731
I'm sorry.
I should have turned that down.

632
00:37:30,798 --> 00:37:32,926
No, I... I like it. I...

633
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:38,561
I was imagining Charlie
dancing in her dress.

634
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,575
Do you dance, Mr. Church?

635
00:37:47,615 --> 00:37:49,049
There are those
who play music...

636
00:37:49,116 --> 00:37:50,675
And there are those
who dance to it.

637
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:52,719
And the rare person
who does both.

638
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,354
Why, I do believe
that is the first time...

639
00:37:57,425 --> 00:37:59,951
I have heard you compliment yourself.

640
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:07,133
Dance with me.

641
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:09,661
Ma'am?

642
00:38:11,572 --> 00:38:12,767
Come on. Now.

643
00:38:34,996 --> 00:38:37,931
I dare say he speaks the truth.

644
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,070
Okay, okay, I got you <i>I</i> got you.

645
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:52,808
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

646
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,143
It's okay.

647
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,679
Thank you.

648
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,947
Thank you.

649
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,818
9011 you.

650
00:39:41,162 --> 00:39:43,460
- Let me get that.
- Thanks.

651
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:49,160
I'll get the gate.

652
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,140
I had a really great time tonight.

653
00:40:00,247 --> 00:40:02,215
Me too.

654
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:13,825
Good night, Charlie.

655
00:40:38,652 --> 00:40:40,245
<i>So, tell me.</i>

656
00:40:41,655 --> 00:40:43,214
Was it lame?

657
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,182
No.

658
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,785
No.

659
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,591
It was...

660
00:40:51,565 --> 00:40:52,964
Beautiful.

661
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:56,562
You should be in bed.

662
00:40:56,637 --> 00:40:58,127
I wanted to wait up for you...

663
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,196
Just like every other mother...

664
00:41:00,274 --> 00:41:02,743
Who waited up
for their daughter tonight.

665
00:41:04,779 --> 00:41:06,008
Did you dance'?

666
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,605
All night.

667
00:41:07,681 --> 00:41:09,206
Did he kiss you?

668
00:41:13,687 --> 00:41:18,181
Well, <i>kisses come
in</i> all <i>sorts</i> of <i>ways,</i> baby.

669
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,612
<i>People act strange around death.</i>

670
00:42:21,689 --> 00:42:23,623
<i>There are those
who talk about everything...</i>

671
00:42:23,657 --> 00:42:24,818
<i>But the person who died.</i>

672
00:42:24,892 --> 00:42:28,157
And I told Mr. Rinaldo
that two pounds of meat was plenty...

673
00:42:28,229 --> 00:42:30,630
But he insisted on giving me three.

674
00:42:30,664 --> 00:42:32,029
And I said, "that's ridiculous..."

675
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:34,329
<i>There are those who only talk
about the person who died.</i>

676
00:42:34,401 --> 00:42:36,665
Your mother was always
very nice to me.

677
00:42:36,737 --> 00:42:39,229
I thought she was pretty too.

678
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:42,173
I always wondered why she didn't have
a boyfriend or something.

679
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:44,871
<i>There are those who fry
to cheer you up.</i>

680
00:42:44,945 --> 00:42:47,778
Your mother's at peace, Charlie.

681
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,648
Out of pain.

682
00:42:50,684 --> 00:42:52,083
You don't want her in pain.

683
00:42:55,222 --> 00:42:58,192
<i>And those who can'? Help
but make you cry.</i>

684
00:42:58,926 --> 00:43:00,360
You know, I've always wished...

685
00:43:00,427 --> 00:43:02,794
I'd had a mom like yours, Charlie.

686
00:43:02,863 --> 00:43:05,389
Why can't it be
my mom who's dead...

687
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,861
Not yours?

688
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,898
<i>And then there are those
who say nothing at all...</i>

689
00:43:21,248 --> 00:43:23,376
<i>Because they don't have to.</i>

690
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,991
<i>But When everyone was gone...</i>

691
00:43:34,061 --> 00:43:35,961
<i>The people and the noise
and the chatter...</i>

692
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,794
<i>And the hospital bed...</i>

693
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:41,431
<i>If was just Mr. Church and me.</i>

694
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,766
<i>And I liked it.</i>

695
00:44:09,296 --> 00:44:13,392
<i>If was the first and only time
I ever saw Mr. Church cry.</i>

696
00:44:14,835 --> 00:44:16,894
<i>Even his weeping was graceful.</i>

697
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,168
What's going to happen now?

698
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:25,201
What will you do?

699
00:44:25,279 --> 00:44:27,805
Your job is done.

700
00:44:27,881 --> 00:44:30,145
I haven't even thought about it.

701
00:44:31,785 --> 00:44:34,811
Guess I'll start
thinking about it now.

702
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:42,852
I have something for you.

703
00:44:44,331 --> 00:44:46,356
Actually, it's from your mother.

704
00:44:51,472 --> 00:44:53,770
I kept a record
of all the money I saved...

705
00:44:53,841 --> 00:44:56,037
Marketing with those coupons
your mother gave me.

706
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,772
I always did say they add up.

707
00:44:58,812 --> 00:45:00,412
I guess you can call
Boston university...

708
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:03,314
And tell them that Charlotte Brooks
will be attending.

709
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:08,785
All right.

710
00:45:11,558 --> 00:45:13,048
Okay, I guess you're going to...

711
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,323
Need a way to get there.

712
00:45:15,396 --> 00:45:16,522
I...

713
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,323
Always did hate riding the bus.

714
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,267
<i>Mr. Church didn't have a license.</i>

715
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:25,499
<i>So, I knew he couldn't teach me
how to drive.</i>

716
00:45:25,572 --> 00:45:28,542
<i>I went to the one person
who I knew could.</i>

717
00:45:30,044 --> 00:45:31,808
Okay.

718
00:45:33,414 --> 00:45:35,143
Just put the key
in the ignition, and...

719
00:45:39,887 --> 00:45:42,083
Put your foot on the clutch there.

720
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,988
And when you give it gas...

721
00:45:44,058 --> 00:45:46,083
You're going to slowly release.

722
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,491
- Foot off the brake.
- Okay.

723
00:45:47,528 --> 00:45:50,122
And on the accelerator.
Nice and easy.

724
00:45:51,865 --> 00:45:53,890
We're going. We're going.
There you go. Okay.

725
00:45:53,967 --> 00:45:55,093
Whoa, oh, oh!

726
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,365
You have to take your foot
off the brake as well.

727
00:45:57,404 --> 00:45:59,372
Release the clutch slowly.

728
00:45:59,406 --> 00:46:01,374
- Are you okay?
- Put your foot on the clutch.

729
00:46:01,408 --> 00:46:02,952
- I... whoa, whoa, I'm sorry.
- Nice and slow.

730
00:46:02,976 --> 00:46:05,240
Oh! You okay? You okay?
You okay?

731
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:07,111
- Foot on the clutch.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

732
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,381
I'm sorry.
I swear I'll get it.

733
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:09,917
It's okay.

734
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:14,187
Good. Nice.
That's a good speed.

735
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,120
Picking up speed.

736
00:46:27,634 --> 00:46:30,126
This is great.

737
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:31,569
I did it.

738
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:53,588
Until the twelfth of never...

739
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,924
Charlie...

740
00:46:55,996 --> 00:46:59,193
You're going to be
a famous writer.

741
00:46:59,266 --> 00:47:00,097
Yeah.

742
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:02,898
I'm going to be a famous
fashion designer.

743
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,460
And all the duds in this town...

744
00:47:04,538 --> 00:47:05,903
They're going to say...

745
00:47:05,939 --> 00:47:09,375
"Oh, damn, aren't those the two
charity case girls from St. Frances?"

746
00:47:09,443 --> 00:47:10,963
- Well, I'll be damned.
- You're crazy!

747
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:13,605
I'm not crazy.
What I am is free.

748
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,117
New York, I am
on my way. Clear this.

749
00:47:18,185 --> 00:47:20,176
I'm completely lost.

750
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,383
New York, New York, New York.

751
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:29,624
Get us the hell out of here.
Bunch of lowlife drunks.

752
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:39,967
<i>More than ever...</i>

753
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,203
<i>I wanted to know everything
about Mr. Church.</i>

754
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,978
Good night, Charlotte.

755
00:47:47,047 --> 00:47:49,209
Good night, Mr. Church.

756
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:54,420
<i>I wanted to ask him
about jelly's place.</i>

757
00:47:54,488 --> 00:47:57,014
<i>Wanted him to know
he could fell me.</i>

758
00:47:57,658 --> 00:48:00,184
<i>I knew the rumors about jelly's.</i>

759
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,493
<i>Most of all, I wanted to know
Mr. Church was happy.</i>

760
00:48:10,537 --> 00:48:13,472
<i>With mama gone
and me leaving for college...</i>

761
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,440
<i>I worried about him.</i>

762
00:48:15,509 --> 00:48:17,170
<i>I thought if I Could see his house...</i>

763
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:20,042
<i>Meet someone who loved him
as much as mama and me...</i>

764
00:48:20,113 --> 00:48:23,083
<i>Somehow I would know
he was okay.</i>

765
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:28,113
Charlie?

766
00:48:28,188 --> 00:48:30,520
What are you doing
walking around alone at night?

767
00:48:33,727 --> 00:48:35,695
You want to jump in?

768
00:48:46,273 --> 00:48:49,299
Listen, have I done
something wrong?

769
00:48:50,377 --> 00:48:52,072
What?

770
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,147
You've hardly spoken to me lately.

771
00:48:54,214 --> 00:48:55,704
Hell, you won't even look at me.

772
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,215
Why'd you take me to prom?

773
00:49:02,756 --> 00:49:04,246
What are you talking about?

774
00:49:04,324 --> 00:49:06,053
You could have asked
any girl in school.

775
00:49:06,126 --> 00:49:08,595
Popular girls, girls with money.

776
00:49:08,662 --> 00:49:10,494
<i>Why ma?</i>

777
00:49:10,564 --> 00:49:13,431
That's a dumb question.
I don't know, because I like you.

778
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,558
Because you're smart.

779
00:49:14,635 --> 00:49:17,195
Or was it because
my mama was dying?

780
00:49:17,271 --> 00:49:18,271
What?

781
00:49:18,338 --> 00:49:21,239
If that's the reason, it's okay.

782
00:49:21,308 --> 00:49:22,742
I... I get it.

783
00:49:22,809 --> 00:49:24,436
Poor Charlie Brooks.

784
00:49:24,511 --> 00:49:26,240
Poor fatherless,
soon to be motherless...

785
00:49:26,313 --> 00:49:27,833
- Pathetic Charlie Brooks.
- Charlie...

786
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,346
I get it.
Charity case.

787
00:49:30,417 --> 00:49:32,044
But let's just be honest about it.

788
00:49:32,085 --> 00:49:33,396
I mean, you never even kissed me.

789
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,300
So, if the reason you took me
was out of pity...

790
00:49:52,439 --> 00:49:54,430
I don't pity you.

791
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:07,278
I'm leaving tomorrow
for school, Charlie.

792
00:50:10,223 --> 00:50:13,124
My folks are driving me up early.

793
00:50:13,193 --> 00:50:15,753
That's why I came looking for you.

794
00:50:18,465 --> 00:50:20,365
<i>To say good-ene-</i>

795
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:27,097
you study hard, Owen.

796
00:50:29,543 --> 00:50:32,342
You do something important
with your life, okay?

797
00:50:36,183 --> 00:50:37,708
Charlie...

798
00:50:47,594 --> 00:50:50,825
Never been to a restaurant
with you before, Mr. Church.

799
00:50:50,897 --> 00:50:52,857
Well, I figured since
it's your last night here...

800
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:55,266
We should eat out.

801
00:50:55,335 --> 00:50:57,702
Sorry for the wait, folks.
What can I get you?

802
00:50:57,771 --> 00:50:59,830
Oh, um...

803
00:50:59,906 --> 00:51:01,340
Hey, do you have apple Jacks'?

804
00:51:01,408 --> 00:51:03,206
Comes in a box.

805
00:51:03,276 --> 00:51:05,608
Tastes mostly like sugar
and apples, mainly.

806
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:07,807
- Yes, sir.
- I'll have that.

807
00:51:07,881 --> 00:51:10,475
Yeah, I'll have the same.

808
00:51:16,256 --> 00:51:20,159
And I suppose this is the last
of Richard's money...

809
00:51:20,227 --> 00:51:22,218
You'll ever spend on me.

810
00:51:22,295 --> 00:51:24,286
Poor fool.

811
00:51:24,364 --> 00:51:27,163
He thought he'd only have
to shell out enough for six months.

812
00:51:27,234 --> 00:51:28,668
Mama sure showed him.

813
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,341
Mr. Church?

814
00:51:37,411 --> 00:51:39,607
Two apple Jacks.

815
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,512
Right on time.

816
00:51:41,581 --> 00:51:42,844
You're welcome. Enjoy.

817
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:45,180
Oh, that looks wonderful.

818
00:51:45,218 --> 00:51:46,652
Yes.

819
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:59,462
Apples and sugar.

820
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,501
No secret there.

821
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:07,698
<i>I took clothes and books.</i>

822
00:52:07,774 --> 00:52:09,435
<i>Nothing else.</i>

823
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:13,476
<i>I told Mr. Church to take
whatever he wanted of mama's...</i>

824
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,777
<i>And whatever was left
to give to charity.</i>

825
00:53:27,821 --> 00:53:31,883
<i>I had driven 3,000 miles
to find out something amazing.</i>

826
00:53:32,025 --> 00:53:35,757
<i>Here, no one knew me
as poor Charlie Brooks.</i>

827
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:38,423
<i>College was just how
I imagined it.</i>

828
00:53:38,498 --> 00:53:41,433
<i>Full of energy and color.</i>

829
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:44,468
<i>Here, I could be anyone
I wanted to be.</i>

830
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:49,041
And if we suppose that Shakespeare
instructed Thorpe to name...

831
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:52,609
W.H. In the dedication, then...

832
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:55,808
<i>I studied hard, and when
I felt foo fired to keep going...</i>

833
00:53:55,882 --> 00:53:58,749
<i>I thought of all those damn coupons
mom would cut to get me here...</i>

834
00:53:58,819 --> 00:53:59,980
<i>And it pushed me through.</i>

835
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,591
All right, that's it.
No more studying.

836
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,627
- No!
- No, we're going out.

837
00:54:08,028 --> 00:54:10,759
<i>Mr. Church wrote me every week.</i>

838
00:54:12,098 --> 00:54:14,430
<i>And always sent me books.</i>

839
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,036
<i>Seasons changed.</i>

840
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:25,510
<i>Roommates came and went.</i>

841
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,542
<i>Class schedules changed...</i>

842
00:54:28,615 --> 00:54:32,848
<i>And I got closer every day
towards graduating.</i>

843
00:54:32,919 --> 00:54:35,411
<i>They say, for some,
college is the time of your life...</i>

844
00:54:35,488 --> 00:54:37,820
<i>Where you find yourself.</i>

845
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,350
<i>And for others...</i>

846
00:54:41,428 --> 00:54:42,918
Hey, how you doing?
Hey, I'm Charlie.

847
00:54:42,996 --> 00:54:43,929
Nice to meet you.

848
00:54:43,997 --> 00:54:45,487
<i>If can also be a time...</i>

849
00:54:45,565 --> 00:54:47,556
<i>Where you slowly get lost.</i>

850
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,530
<i>And sometimes...</i>

851
00:54:55,942 --> 00:54:57,569
<i>You just have to go home.</i>

852
00:54:58,645 --> 00:55:00,374
<i>Wherever that may be.</i>

853
00:55:00,413 --> 00:55:02,040
Hi.

854
00:55:02,082 --> 00:55:03,982
It's Charlie.

855
00:55:23,003 --> 00:55:24,003
Surprise.

856
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,037
<i>Seems the legacy
of the Brooks family...</i>

857
00:55:28,108 --> 00:55:30,839
<i>Was having babies
out of wedlock.</i>

858
00:55:42,555 --> 00:55:47,618
Sorry I stopped
writing you, Mr. Church.

859
00:55:47,694 --> 00:55:49,685
You know, I stopped
writing poppy too.

860
00:55:49,729 --> 00:55:52,960
Things... things just got
a little crazy for me.

861
00:55:53,033 --> 00:55:54,797
I can see that.

862
00:55:55,702 --> 00:55:57,466
But I read all your letters...

863
00:55:57,537 --> 00:55:59,835
Sometimes even twice a day.

864
00:56:00,974 --> 00:56:03,705
Anyway, I needed
a break and I thought...

865
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:06,041
"Go surprise Mr. Church."

866
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,911
Yeah, well, you really surprised me.

867
00:56:12,652 --> 00:56:14,882
Can I stay for a few days?

868
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,684
I mean, I brought my books.

869
00:56:16,756 --> 00:56:18,036
I can study here and everything.

870
00:56:18,091 --> 00:56:21,152
I just need a place to rest.

871
00:56:25,665 --> 00:56:29,192
Okay. I got one rule.

872
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,130
You respect my privacy.

873
00:56:31,171 --> 00:56:32,764
'Cause you're in my house now, right'?

874
00:56:32,839 --> 00:56:35,035
Yeah, okay.
I will.

875
00:56:35,108 --> 00:56:35,973
Okay.

876
00:56:36,042 --> 00:56:38,136
<i>If was like we were never apart.</i>

877
00:56:38,178 --> 00:56:39,077
All right, then.

878
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:42,740
<i>He never asked a single question
about my being pregnant.</i>

879
00:56:42,782 --> 00:56:45,251
Still smoking outside, Mr. Church?

880
00:56:47,087 --> 00:56:48,248
Yeah, as of today.

881
00:56:48,521 --> 00:56:51,047
<i>I guess Mr. Church
respected my privacy...</i>

882
00:56:51,124 --> 00:56:53,957
<i>As much as he asked me
to respect his.</i>

883
00:56:54,027 --> 00:56:56,655
<i>All I knew being back with Mr. Church...</i>

884
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:58,061
<i>Was that I was home.</i>

885
00:57:09,876 --> 00:57:12,573
<i>All those years wondering
where Mr. Church lived...</i>

886
00:57:12,645 --> 00:57:15,046
<i>And I was now standing
in the center of it.</i>

887
00:57:15,081 --> 00:57:16,776
Try this.

888
00:57:24,624 --> 00:57:26,820
- Licorice?
- That's right.

889
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:40,850
Hey, I brought an extra blanket.

890
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,740
It gets cold in here
at night sometimes.

891
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:44,971
And the sun shines
in that window really bright.

892
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:47,139
You might want
to close that curtain.

893
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,012
Is this you?

894
00:57:51,317 --> 00:57:53,115
I'm sorry. I wasn't snooping.

895
00:57:53,186 --> 00:57:54,711
I just found it in the drawer.

896
00:57:54,788 --> 00:57:56,847
Yeah, that's me and my father.

897
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,224
You look like him.

898
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:04,874
I'm going to leave the light on...

899
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,075
For you out here
in case you want to get...

900
00:58:06,099 --> 00:58:07,243
Some milk or something at night.

901
00:58:07,267 --> 00:58:08,632
Good night, my dear.

902
00:58:08,701 --> 00:58:09,998
Good night, Mr. Church.

903
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,196
You can't change me, old man!

904
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,892
You're not changing shit!

905
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,900
Oh, I'm a sinner?
Yeah, that's right!

906
00:58:44,971 --> 00:58:46,598
I'm a sinner!

907
00:58:50,143 --> 00:58:53,113
Who's a faggot?
You the goddamn faggot.

908
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,146
Talking the shit.

909
00:59:05,892 --> 00:59:08,361
Kick your <i>ass,</i> old man.

910
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,722
Shit, I ain't no kid no more.

911
00:59:15,268 --> 00:59:19,171
You don't tell me a goddamn thing!

912
00:59:23,176 --> 00:59:25,770
<i>I took the book of matches
from jelly's...</i>

913
00:59:25,845 --> 00:59:27,189
<i>Because I knew
he'd be embarrassed...</i>

914
00:59:27,213 --> 00:59:29,079
<i>If he saw that I'd found it.</i>

915
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:32,813
<i>And come morning,
there was Mr. Church making breakfast...</i>

916
00:59:32,886 --> 00:59:35,116
<i>Smelling like soap and seasonings...</i>

917
00:59:35,188 --> 00:59:36,656
<i>Listening to his music.</i>

918
00:59:36,689 --> 00:59:38,783
Hey, you're awake.

919
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,725
The baby's got to eat.

920
00:59:41,961 --> 00:59:44,020
How was your night, Mr. Church?

921
00:59:44,097 --> 00:59:46,122
It was pleasant enough.

922
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:48,793
<i>And that's all he would ever say.</i>

923
00:59:48,868 --> 00:59:50,393
<i>Pleasant enough.</i>

924
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:00,407
Those are the only keys
I never quite got the hang of.

925
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,308
About time I let somebody else
try to play them.

926
01:00:04,918 --> 01:00:07,353
Your thesis awaits, my dear.

927
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:10,253
Start with the first word
and the rest will follow.

928
01:01:25,465 --> 01:01:28,093
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Oh, I'm... I was just...

929
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:29,965
- Okay, now you got to go.
- Mr. Church...

930
01:01:30,036 --> 01:01:31,676
- Let's go, right now!
- I'm... I'm sorry.

931
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,449
- I'm sorry.
- I give you one goddamn rule...

932
01:01:33,473 --> 01:01:34,984
- And you break it, right'?
- I'm sorry!

933
01:01:35,008 --> 01:01:36,185
You get out of my shit right now.

934
01:01:36,209 --> 01:01:37,953
- Pack your shit and go!
- You're hurting me!

935
01:01:37,977 --> 01:01:39,388
- Just get out!
- Where am I supposed to go?

936
01:01:39,412 --> 01:01:40,489
It's the middle of the night.

937
01:01:40,513 --> 01:01:42,242
That's not my goddamn problem.

938
01:01:43,216 --> 01:01:46,208
I'm not a child anymore, Mr. Church!

939
01:01:48,087 --> 01:01:50,988
Or are you too drunk to see that?

940
01:01:51,057 --> 01:01:52,320
What is it with all of you?

941
01:01:52,392 --> 01:01:55,487
The secrets and lies
and more secrets?

942
01:01:55,561 --> 01:01:57,120
Don't tell Charlie I'm dying.

943
01:01:57,196 --> 01:01:59,995
Don't tell Charlie a goddamn thing.

944
01:02:00,066 --> 01:02:02,899
I just wanted to know you, Mr. Church.

945
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,198
Look, I was your cook.

946
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:05,897
That's all you need to know.

947
01:02:23,923 --> 01:02:25,891
<i>I had nowhere to go.</i>

948
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:28,484
<i>And for the first time...</i>

949
01:02:28,528 --> 01:02:30,929
<i>I realized I had no one.</i>

950
01:03:11,404 --> 01:03:13,270
Larson?

951
01:03:13,339 --> 01:03:15,034
Larson!

952
01:03:17,343 --> 01:03:19,869
Hey, Charlie.

953
01:03:19,912 --> 01:03:21,880
Look at you, you're all...

954
01:03:21,914 --> 01:03:22,972
Pregnant and married.

955
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:26,041
Oh, no.
Just... just pregnant.

956
01:03:27,987 --> 01:03:29,455
Well, you living out here again?

957
01:03:29,522 --> 01:03:32,014
No, still in college.

958
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,924
Just, you know, came to see......

959
01:03:33,993 --> 01:03:36,018
Came to visit.

960
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,996
Heading back tonight.

961
01:03:40,266 --> 01:03:41,597
You still got that car, or...

962
01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:44,432
Oh, it's good.
It's right over there.

963
01:03:44,504 --> 01:03:45,665
Yeah.

964
01:03:45,938 --> 01:03:47,633
Do you need a ride somewhere?

965
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,466
Oh, no, no, no.

966
01:03:49,542 --> 01:03:50,907
No, I...

967
01:03:50,943 --> 01:03:53,969
I'd better get a...

968
01:03:54,046 --> 01:03:56,947
Hey, it was good...
Good seeing you, though.

969
01:03:57,016 --> 01:03:59,314
Yeah, you too, Larson.

970
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:12,520
Oh, shit!

971
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:24,942
I swear to god, dude,
I didn't even see her.

972
01:04:24,977 --> 01:04:26,342
Charlotte, come here.

973
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:30,981
Here, get the door.

974
01:05:15,228 --> 01:05:17,196
Breathe, Charlie, breathe.

975
01:05:32,745 --> 01:05:34,770
<i>I heard the doctors and nurses...</i>

976
01:05:35,147 --> 01:05:37,707
<i>Whispering it was a miracle
the baby didn't die.</i>

977
01:05:37,783 --> 01:05:39,444
<i>I wanted to fell them...</i>

978
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:41,146
<i>"don 't you know?</i>

979
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,279
<i>Miracles run in the Brooks family.”</i>

980
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:46,690
you need to be very careful.
Lots of rest, Charlie.

981
01:05:46,726 --> 01:05:48,160
Do you have a place to stay?

982
01:05:48,227 --> 01:05:49,227
She lives with me.

983
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:52,531
You are?

984
01:05:52,598 --> 01:05:54,692
I'm Mr. Church.

985
01:05:56,736 --> 01:05:58,568
Are you responsible for Charlie?

986
01:06:05,678 --> 01:06:07,305
Yeah.

987
01:06:17,156 --> 01:06:20,057
<i>The baby gave Mr. Church
a sense of purpose and excitement.</i>

988
01:06:20,126 --> 01:06:22,720
Oh! There she goes again.

989
01:06:22,762 --> 01:06:24,628
"She," Mr. Church?

990
01:06:24,697 --> 01:06:27,189
Well, it's a guess.
She feels like... I'm feeling she.

991
01:06:32,705 --> 01:06:35,470
Aren't you going to ask me
how it happened?

992
01:06:35,541 --> 01:06:39,205
I know how girls
get pregnant, Charlotte.

993
01:06:39,845 --> 01:06:41,813
<i>If he wasn't gardening...</i>

994
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,344
<i>He was painting.</i>

995
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:44,474
<i>If he wasn't painting...</i>

996
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:46,780
<i>He was cooking.</i>

997
01:06:46,852 --> 01:06:48,251
<i>If he wasn't cooking...</i>

998
01:06:48,321 --> 01:06:50,517
<i>He was playing the piano.</i>

999
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,253
<i>And if he wasn't playing
the piano...</i>

1000
01:06:58,331 --> 01:07:00,561
<i>He was reading to me.</i>

1001
01:07:00,633 --> 01:07:02,101
Bonnie?

1002
01:07:02,134 --> 01:07:03,624
Too cute.

1003
01:07:03,703 --> 01:07:05,262
Brenda?

1004
01:07:05,338 --> 01:07:08,103
Too dangerous.

1005
01:07:08,174 --> 01:07:09,335
Beth?

1006
01:07:09,408 --> 01:07:10,842
Too simple.

1007
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,407
How about Carrie?

1008
01:07:14,347 --> 01:07:15,678
No.

1009
01:07:20,686 --> 01:07:23,383
<i>Every Wednesday
and Saturday night...</i>

1010
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,254
<i>Mr. Church went out.</i>

1011
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,259
Good night, Charlotte.

1012
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:30,319
<i>He never said
where he was going.</i>

1013
01:07:30,396 --> 01:07:32,831
<i>And I never asked.</i>

1014
01:07:35,868 --> 01:07:37,768
<i>But I knew.</i>

1015
01:07:37,837 --> 01:07:40,534
You have Irene.
Or Iris.

1016
01:07:40,573 --> 01:07:42,132
Irma...

1017
01:07:42,174 --> 01:07:43,471
Mr. Church?

1018
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:45,153
- Irma sound like an old lady.
- Mr. Church?

1019
01:07:45,177 --> 01:07:46,770
- Mr. Church?
- Isabel.

1020
01:07:46,846 --> 01:07:48,610
Isabel. What do you think
of Isabel'?

1021
01:07:48,681 --> 01:07:51,742
Mr. Church....Oh, my god.
Oh, my god, we got to go.

1022
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:53,285
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1023
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,616
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1024
01:07:54,687 --> 01:07:56,280
I'll call right now.

1025
01:08:15,441 --> 01:08:17,500
<i>Mr. Church was right.</i>

1026
01:08:17,576 --> 01:08:19,442
<i>I was having a baby girl.</i>

1027
01:08:19,478 --> 01:08:21,469
She's going to need
a name, Charlotte.

1028
01:08:26,385 --> 01:08:27,716
Isabel.

1029
01:08:27,753 --> 01:08:29,687
Isabel Marie Brooks.

1030
01:08:30,923 --> 01:08:32,584
Hey.

1031
01:08:32,658 --> 01:08:34,319
Hey, Isabel.

1032
01:08:34,393 --> 01:08:36,589
I'm Mr. Church.

1033
01:08:45,271 --> 01:08:47,262
<i>Everything was about Izzy.</i>

1034
01:08:48,941 --> 01:08:51,342
We're going to go right...

1035
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:01,282
<i>Getting that degree seemed
to slip farther and farther away.</i>

1036
01:09:01,353 --> 01:09:02,752
<i>And after a while...</i>

1037
01:09:02,788 --> 01:09:05,689
<i>Mr. Church stopped
asking me about it.</i>

1038
01:09:05,758 --> 01:09:07,487
<i>I was a mother.</i>

1039
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,891
<i>And Mr. Church...</i>

1040
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:10,827
My Izzy...

1041
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:13,388
<i>He was everything else.</i>

1042
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:19,831
It's okay.
It's okay.

1043
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:21,964
Izzy...

1044
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:23,800
Yes,

1045
01:09:27,513 --> 01:09:29,311
Mr. Church,
dance with me.

1046
01:09:29,381 --> 01:09:30,926
Okay, I will in a second.
Just hold still.

1047
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:32,782
I'm almost finished.
Oh, come on.

1048
01:09:32,852 --> 01:09:34,581
Come on now...
Hey, come on.

1049
01:09:34,653 --> 01:09:36,587
- We're going to be late.
- Mama, dance with me.

1050
01:09:36,655 --> 01:09:38,316
No, not now.
We got to go, baby.

1051
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:39,935
- Come on, come on.
- Mama, dance with me.

1052
01:09:39,959 --> 01:09:41,984
- Let's go, let's go.
- Oh! Okay.

1053
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,593
One dance, I guess.

1054
01:09:44,663 --> 01:09:46,529
Mr. Church...

1055
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,658
Come on, Mr. Church.
One dance.

1056
01:09:58,410 --> 01:09:59,741
Charlie?

1057
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:03,548
It's crazy, right'?

1058
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,675
It's wonderful.
Congratulations.

1059
01:10:05,718 --> 01:10:07,550
Thank you so much
for coming out.

1060
01:10:07,586 --> 01:10:11,318
<i>Larson fell in love with a gal he met
at one of his AA meetings.</i>

1061
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:18,423
You know, she wouldn't be here
if it weren't for you.

1062
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:19,898
No, she's beautiful.

1063
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:25,434
I like that dress.
Did you make that?

1064
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:28,771
You know, there's something
I never told you about that day.

1065
01:10:31,043 --> 01:10:32,636
I'd scraped up enough cash...

1066
01:10:32,711 --> 01:10:35,442
To buy a bottle of Jack
and some pills, and...

1067
01:10:37,716 --> 01:10:39,661
I was just going to go home
and check out for good.

1068
01:10:39,685 --> 01:10:41,779
You know?

1069
01:10:41,854 --> 01:10:44,050
And then you fell.

1070
01:10:47,459 --> 01:10:50,451
You know, you always say
that I saved Izzy's life...

1071
01:10:50,529 --> 01:10:55,023
But the truth is
that both of you saved mine.

1072
01:11:00,739 --> 01:11:02,707
Don't you think my mom's pretty?

1073
01:11:02,775 --> 01:11:04,709
I think she's beautiful.

1074
01:11:06,378 --> 01:11:08,403
Well, I guess I'd better go
dance with my wife.

1075
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:09,675
Yeah!

1076
01:11:19,758 --> 01:11:21,021
Hey, there you go.

1077
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:23,051
Oh, thank you.

1078
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:26,821
Do you ever want
to get married, Mr. Church?

1079
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:29,631
I'm sorry.

1080
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:31,431
That's none of my business.

1081
01:11:31,503 --> 01:11:33,631
I was married before.

1082
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,906
Yes, I was married before.

1083
01:11:36,942 --> 01:11:38,967
A long time ago.
I was very young.

1084
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:40,978
I got married
because my father...

1085
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:43,378
Wanted me to get married,
but it didn't last very long.

1086
01:11:43,449 --> 01:11:44,644
I wasn't very good at it.

1087
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,776
She was a very lovely lady, though.

1088
01:11:46,819 --> 01:11:48,844
I guess I just wasn't
what she was looking for.

1089
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,991
Any man and woman
can get married, Charlotte.

1090
01:11:59,665 --> 01:12:01,724
Mr. Church...

1091
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,393
Do you want to dance'?

1092
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:29,550
Last time I danced like this
was prom night.

1093
01:12:30,729 --> 01:12:32,720
Me too.

1094
01:12:48,981 --> 01:12:51,040
Thanks.

1095
01:12:51,116 --> 01:12:53,050
Be with you in a second, sir.

1096
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:54,643
- Hey.
- Hi, mama.

1097
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,449
Hi, baby.

1098
01:12:56,522 --> 01:12:57,853
What are you two doing here?

1099
01:12:57,890 --> 01:12:59,517
Found something for you.

1100
01:12:59,591 --> 01:13:00,990
What...

1101
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:06,859
You found her.

1102
01:13:06,899 --> 01:13:08,867
I found her.

1103
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:15,470
Mama, look.

1104
01:13:19,912 --> 01:13:21,471
Thank you.

1105
01:13:21,513 --> 01:13:23,607
Oh, my god!
Charlie!

1106
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:24,946
Poppy!

1107
01:13:25,017 --> 01:13:26,610
You look so glamorous.

1108
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:29,017
So gorgeous.

1109
01:13:31,523 --> 01:13:33,685
- This is Izzy.
- Hello.

1110
01:13:33,759 --> 01:13:35,124
Mr. Church.

1111
01:13:35,194 --> 01:13:36,821
Hey, puppy-

1112
01:13:36,895 --> 01:13:38,954
you're the spitting image
of your grandma.

1113
01:13:39,031 --> 01:13:40,590
You knew my grandmother?

1114
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,177
She was only the most
beautiful woman...

1115
01:13:42,201 --> 01:13:43,498
I've seen in my whole life.

1116
01:13:43,569 --> 01:13:45,936
That's what mom always says.

1117
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:49,834
- Aren't you pretty?
- Is that a real diamond?

1118
01:13:49,908 --> 01:13:53,173
Oh, honey, you ain't seen
nothing yet.

1119
01:13:53,212 --> 01:13:56,773
Come on, get in.
Let's get out of this neighborhood.

1120
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,874
Bye, Mr. Church.

1121
01:13:58,951 --> 01:14:00,248
Have fun, my dear.

1122
01:14:04,089 --> 01:14:05,989
Bye, Mr. Church!

1123
01:14:12,097 --> 01:14:14,862
Didn't I tell you I'd get out
of this stinking town'?

1124
01:14:14,933 --> 01:14:17,664
New York City's so exciting.

1125
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:19,797
This one was fifth Avenue.

1126
01:14:19,838 --> 01:14:21,203
Super-smart Charlie...

1127
01:14:21,273 --> 01:14:23,139
It's a place for someone
like you who reads.

1128
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:25,006
Well, you certainly married well.

1129
01:14:25,077 --> 01:14:26,272
I married well both times.

1130
01:14:28,013 --> 01:14:30,072
Here, let me show you
the good stuff.

1131
01:14:30,149 --> 01:14:33,119
Look at this.
Look at the beading.

1132
01:14:34,953 --> 01:14:37,047
I... I heard your parents were out.

1133
01:14:37,122 --> 01:14:38,749
Living up north somewhere?

1134
01:14:38,824 --> 01:14:40,690
I wouldn't know.

1135
01:14:40,759 --> 01:14:42,249
Oh, I...
I just figured...

1136
01:14:42,327 --> 01:14:44,625
You stayed in touch with your sister.

1137
01:14:44,696 --> 01:14:46,164
My family's gone, Charlie.

1138
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:48,791
Let's not talk of them again.
Look at this one.

1139
01:14:48,867 --> 01:14:51,632
It's a birthday gift. Parisian.

1140
01:14:51,703 --> 01:14:53,694
- Yeah.
- Feel it.

1141
01:14:55,107 --> 01:14:57,974
Isn't that fabric wonderful?

1142
01:14:58,010 --> 01:14:59,910
Amazing.

1143
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:10,054
Aunt poppy plans
to spoil you rotten.

1144
01:15:10,122 --> 01:15:12,352
These stores are expensive.

1145
01:15:12,624 --> 01:15:14,718
Let me.
I'll never have a child of my own.

1146
01:15:14,793 --> 01:15:16,056
You don't know that.

1147
01:15:16,128 --> 01:15:18,153
No, I do.
I could have at one time.

1148
01:15:18,230 --> 01:15:21,256
I've got all the scars to prove it.

1149
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:24,132
You should see where
I shop in Manhattan.

1150
01:15:24,169 --> 01:15:26,194
Are you happy?

1151
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:28,933
I have everything I want.

1152
01:15:29,007 --> 01:15:33,001
So, you know, no boyfriend,
no romance in your life'?

1153
01:15:33,078 --> 01:15:35,012
Single moms aren't exactly popular.

1154
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,125
- I've known that my whole life.
- Come to New York with me.

1155
01:15:37,149 --> 01:15:39,675
- I could fix you up with a bunch of fine men.
- What? No.

1156
01:15:39,751 --> 01:15:42,686
Yeah. You would love it.
Izzy would love it.

1157
01:15:42,754 --> 01:15:44,813
I can get her into any private school
you want.

1158
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:46,085
That's not going to happen.

1159
01:15:46,158 --> 01:15:47,819
I know a few bachelors who would...

1160
01:15:47,893 --> 01:15:50,021
I mean, they're no Owen Baxter,
but they have money.

1161
01:15:50,062 --> 01:15:52,224
I don't need money.
Baby, don't go too far.

1162
01:15:54,032 --> 01:15:56,364
I have a job.
I make a paycheck.

1163
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,160
Waiting tables.
I'm not ashamed.

1164
01:15:58,203 --> 01:16:00,297
No, come on, Charlie.
Don't be so stubborn.

1165
01:16:00,339 --> 01:16:01,898
You don't have anything here.

1166
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:03,704
You can't go living
with your cook forever.

1167
01:16:03,775 --> 01:16:05,106
My cook?

1168
01:16:05,177 --> 01:16:07,043
Oh, you know what I mean.

1169
01:16:07,112 --> 01:16:10,104
What happened to you, poppy?

1170
01:16:10,182 --> 01:16:11,809
You used to be a lot of things...

1171
01:16:11,884 --> 01:16:13,045
But you were never a snob.

1172
01:16:13,085 --> 01:16:16,248
- Charlie...
- You want to know something about my cook?

1173
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:19,780
Richard set aside enough money
for mama to live six months.

1174
01:16:19,858 --> 01:16:21,849
Six months.

1175
01:16:21,927 --> 01:16:24,294
And do you know who paid
all of our bills, food, and rent...

1176
01:16:24,363 --> 01:16:25,831
All those years after that?

1177
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:30,328
Mr. Church didn't work for us.

1178
01:16:30,402 --> 01:16:33,064
He saved us.

1179
01:16:33,105 --> 01:16:35,403
Now, I may not have some fancy life...

1180
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:38,803
But I work hard
and I'm raising my baby.

1181
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:41,211
She's my diamond, poppy.

1182
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,271
I'm sorry if it doesn't
sparkle enough for you.

1183
01:16:44,883 --> 01:16:46,363
Come on, baby.
We're going to go home.

1184
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:55,989
And let's put the rocking chair
up there.

1185
01:17:00,966 --> 01:17:02,764
And...

1186
01:17:04,836 --> 01:17:07,237
Well, she shouldn't have
bought it.

1187
01:17:07,306 --> 01:17:09,104
I'll return it tomorrow.

1188
01:17:09,141 --> 01:17:11,109
I don't think you should
punish the child...

1189
01:17:11,176 --> 01:17:13,440
Because you and poppy fought.

1190
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:16,306
And you still ain't opened
the gift she left for you.

1191
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:18,076
Well...

1192
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:21,176
Whatever you two argued about...

1193
01:17:22,254 --> 01:17:23,254
Forgive her.

1194
01:17:24,856 --> 01:17:28,121
You should go into the attic.

1195
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:34,260
This little girl should go inside...

1196
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:38,893
This is your room
and that's your room.

1197
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:10,163
I see you don't approve, huh?

1198
01:18:11,803 --> 01:18:14,363
Well, I'm living my own life!

1199
01:18:20,512 --> 01:18:22,537
Goddamn...

1200
01:18:22,814 --> 01:18:25,044
You go ahead and kick me
out of the house, old man.

1201
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:26,846
Go ahead.

1202
01:18:29,087 --> 01:18:30,851
I don't give a shit.

1203
01:18:32,190 --> 01:18:34,921
Your rules? Fine!

1204
01:18:40,465 --> 01:18:43,924
Oh... Just said that...
I don't know, shit.

1205
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:45,334
Mr. Church.

1206
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:48,135
Hey, get your goddamn hands off me.

1207
01:18:48,206 --> 01:18:49,935
I'm not drunk.

1208
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:52,808
I'm not drunk.

1209
01:18:54,079 --> 01:18:56,013
You can't disown nobody, old man.

1210
01:18:56,081 --> 01:18:57,412
I disown you.

1211
01:18:57,482 --> 01:18:59,211
Shit.

1212
01:18:59,284 --> 01:19:01,946
We ain't in Church no more.

1213
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:08,016
The wise son seeketh
the father's instruction...

1214
01:19:08,093 --> 01:19:11,495
But the scorner
heareth not rebuke.

1215
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,602
I don't give a shit.

1216
01:19:37,289 --> 01:19:39,189
How was your night, Mr. Church?

1217
01:19:39,257 --> 01:19:40,986
It was pleasant enough.

1218
01:19:41,059 --> 01:19:42,322
Hey, put some spice in here.

1219
01:19:42,394 --> 01:19:43,987
And watch out.
The pan is hot.

1220
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:47,396
Now watch out for that pan.

1221
01:19:47,466 --> 01:19:49,400
Very good.

1222
01:19:54,306 --> 01:19:58,402
<i>It was the first time
the matches were left oh the table.</i>

1223
01:19:58,477 --> 01:20:02,414
<i>Now Mr. Church realized
that I knew about jelly's.</i>

1224
01:20:02,447 --> 01:20:05,007
<i>Probably that I'd always known.</i>

1225
01:20:07,085 --> 01:20:09,281
<i>The matchbook stayed
oh the table all that day...</i>

1226
01:20:09,354 --> 01:20:11,015
<i>And info the next.</i>

1227
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:13,218
<i>But If would be the last.</i>

1228
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:17,023
<i>Mr. Church never came home
drunk again.</i>

1229
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:31,508
You still got that cough, Mr. Church.

1230
01:20:31,576 --> 01:20:33,567
It's only a cough, my dear.

1231
01:20:33,645 --> 01:20:35,374
Okay, well, that's it.
No more fighting me.

1232
01:20:35,447 --> 01:20:38,348
We're getting you looked at.

1233
01:20:40,051 --> 01:20:41,917
I don't need a doctor.
It's the flu.

1234
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,456
Mr. Church.

1235
01:20:47,526 --> 01:20:49,324
Izzy, give me your book, please.

1236
01:20:49,394 --> 01:20:51,556
Thank you.
All right.

1237
01:20:53,398 --> 01:20:56,095
Hello, Mr. Church.

1238
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:00,602
Owen.

1239
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,074
Charlie.

1240
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:07,075
Maybe I will stay.

1241
01:21:07,145 --> 01:21:09,307
Oh, my god.

1242
01:21:09,381 --> 01:21:12,214
Owen, this is my daughter, Izzy.

1243
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:13,479
Hello.

1244
01:21:13,552 --> 01:21:16,544
Can you fix Mr. Church's cough?

1245
01:21:18,089 --> 01:21:20,353
I will certainly give it my all.

1246
01:21:24,563 --> 01:21:27,089
You know, maybe I shouldn't go.

1247
01:21:27,165 --> 01:21:28,963
You're still sick.

1248
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,434
I'm fine.

1249
01:21:30,502 --> 01:21:33,563
And I know where to find
a doctor if I need one.

1250
01:21:40,579 --> 01:21:42,513
Well?

1251
01:21:42,581 --> 01:21:44,640
You're so beautiful, mama.

1252
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,377
Mr. Church, tell her.

1253
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,651
True vision, my dear.

1254
01:21:57,062 --> 01:22:00,259
So, Owen Baxter became a doctor.

1255
01:22:00,298 --> 01:22:03,996
You're the one who told me
to do something good with my life.

1256
01:22:04,069 --> 01:22:05,264
I thought by now...

1257
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:07,999
You'd be a very serious novelist...

1258
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:10,064
Living in Boston.

1259
01:22:10,141 --> 01:22:13,475
I guess life
had other plans for me.

1260
01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:22,453
Izzy?

1261
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:24,455
Izzy.

1262
01:22:26,291 --> 01:22:28,555
Tell me about her father.

1263
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:33,691
Did you love him?

1264
01:22:36,234 --> 01:22:39,169
It was just a foolish night.

1265
01:22:39,237 --> 01:22:44,175
Guess you could say I was
a little lost after mama died.

1266
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:47,042
He didn't want to have
anything to do with the baby.

1267
01:22:48,446 --> 01:22:50,574
But he gave me
the greatest gift.

1268
01:22:55,086 --> 01:22:57,646
I tried finding you for a few years.

1269
01:22:57,722 --> 01:22:59,451
You found me now.

1270
01:23:02,494 --> 01:23:05,054
Morning, Mr. Church.

1271
01:23:07,532 --> 01:23:09,193
Mr. Church?

1272
01:23:15,106 --> 01:23:16,596
Mr. Church?

1273
01:23:18,209 --> 01:23:19,335
Hey.

1274
01:23:19,444 --> 01:23:22,470
Hey, I'm just resting.

1275
01:23:22,514 --> 01:23:24,243
Just resting.

1276
01:23:39,397 --> 01:23:42,628
Mama, where's Mr. Church?

1277
01:23:42,701 --> 01:23:45,466
He's sleeping.

1278
01:23:45,537 --> 01:23:47,164
Sleeping?

1279
01:23:47,238 --> 01:23:49,332
He never sleeps.

1280
01:23:49,407 --> 01:23:51,637
Of course he does, baby.
Everybody sleeps.

1281
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:57,840
I'll make breakfast.

1282
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:00,778
- You?
- Yes, me.

1283
01:24:03,388 --> 01:24:06,551
<i>I fold work I wouldn't be
coming in anytime soon.</i>

1284
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:08,252
<i>Mr. Church was on complete bed rest...</i>

1285
01:24:08,326 --> 01:24:11,125
<i>And it was my turn
to take care of him.</i>

1286
01:24:13,498 --> 01:24:15,330
<i>Somehow, my hands
were doing the work.</i>

1287
01:24:16,901 --> 01:24:18,892
<i>All those years
watching Mr. Church...</i>

1288
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:22,196
<i>Seemed to have soaked
info my skin, my bones.</i>

1289
01:24:22,273 --> 01:24:24,799
<i>And I knew exactly
what needed to be done.</i>

1290
01:24:24,843 --> 01:24:27,244
<i>I chopped, diced, and minced.</i>

1291
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:29,337
<i>Mixed, mashed, and beat.</i>

1292
01:24:29,414 --> 01:24:31,678
<i>Stirred, sprinkled,
dashed, and pinched.</i>

1293
01:24:31,716 --> 01:24:33,184
Ready to try?

1294
01:24:34,219 --> 01:24:35,618
It's very hot.

1295
01:24:35,687 --> 01:24:37,280
Be careful.

1296
01:24:46,431 --> 01:24:49,924
<i>And while bread baked, I sewed.</i>

1297
01:24:50,201 --> 01:24:52,829
<i>And while pies cooled,
I sat at the piano.</i>

1298
01:24:52,871 --> 01:24:55,841
<i>And I realized every talent
Mr. Church had...</i>

1299
01:24:55,874 --> 01:24:57,899
<i>He taught himself
while passing the time...</i>

1300
01:24:58,176 --> 01:24:59,575
<i>Caring for someone else.</i>

1301
01:25:03,314 --> 01:25:05,305
- Hey.
- Can I climb up?

1302
01:25:05,383 --> 01:25:07,374
Yes, of course.
Always.

1303
01:25:07,452 --> 01:25:09,648
How's my favorite little girl doing?

1304
01:25:09,721 --> 01:25:12,190
Good.

1305
01:25:12,223 --> 01:25:13,782
Tell me a story.

1306
01:25:13,858 --> 01:25:16,190
Tell you a story.

1307
01:25:16,227 --> 01:25:17,854
Okay.

1308
01:25:17,896 --> 01:25:19,728
Once upon a time...

1309
01:25:19,764 --> 01:25:22,199
They always start that way.

1310
01:25:22,233 --> 01:25:25,328
Well, that's how you know
it's a story, my dear.

1311
01:25:25,403 --> 01:25:30,398
Once upon a time,
there was a little... Boy.

1312
01:25:30,475 --> 01:25:31,943
What was his name?

1313
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:35,612
What would you like
his name to be?

1314
01:25:36,648 --> 01:25:37,809
Henry.

1315
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:39,350
Like you.

1316
01:25:39,417 --> 01:25:41,749
Well, then Henry it shall be.

1317
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:45,757
Once upon a time, there was
a little boy named Henry.

1318
01:25:45,824 --> 01:25:49,761
And this boy was afraid
of just about everything...

1319
01:25:49,794 --> 01:25:51,888
Except for ladybugs.

1320
01:25:51,996 --> 01:25:54,431
- Ladybugs?
- Ladybugs.

1321
01:25:54,499 --> 01:25:56,365
And one day while he was out...

1322
01:25:56,434 --> 01:25:59,893
A ladybug caught his eye
and he decided to chase it.

1323
01:25:59,971 --> 01:26:02,838
And he chased this ladybug
for so long...

1324
01:26:02,907 --> 01:26:05,308
That he actually turned
into a grown man...

1325
01:26:05,376 --> 01:26:06,639
Chasing the same ladybug.

1326
01:26:06,711 --> 01:26:11,239
And the ladybug led him
to a little tiny house.

1327
01:26:11,316 --> 01:26:13,785
And in the house,
he found the kindest woman...

1328
01:26:13,818 --> 01:26:16,310
And her beautiful little girl living there.

1329
01:26:16,387 --> 01:26:17,980
And the man told the woman...

1330
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:19,934
That he apologized for coming
in the house this way...

1331
01:26:19,958 --> 01:26:21,983
But he was following this ladybug...

1332
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,251
And that he looked everywhere
all over the place.

1333
01:26:24,329 --> 01:26:26,263
He couldn't find it no more.

1334
01:26:26,331 --> 01:26:28,527
He promised her that he'd leave.

1335
01:26:28,566 --> 01:26:32,434
But the woman said,
"don't leave. Stay."

1336
01:26:32,504 --> 01:26:33,835
She said, "stay here with us."

1337
01:26:33,905 --> 01:26:37,535
She said, "we don't have much,
but everything we got...

1338
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:39,805
We'll share with you."

1339
01:26:39,878 --> 01:26:42,540
And did he stay?

1340
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:44,708
He did.
You know why?

1341
01:26:46,818 --> 01:26:51,688
Because for the first time,
he felt safe.

1342
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:56,420
For the first time,
he wasn't afraid.

1343
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,623
He felt happy-

1344
01:26:58,696 --> 01:27:00,630
and he promised
that if he ever saw...

1345
01:27:00,698 --> 01:27:02,427
That ladybug again...

1346
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,435
That he was going to thank her.

1347
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:05,903
Did he?

1348
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,701
Not yet.

1349
01:27:08,773 --> 01:27:11,834
He still hasn't stopped looking.

1350
01:27:14,579 --> 01:27:16,513
Maybe she's in the sky.

1351
01:27:20,852 --> 01:27:22,718
Well, you just might be right.

1352
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:28,425
You just might be right.

1353
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,469
You should be in bed.

1354
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,036
"The blue level
of the Mediterranean...

1355
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:22,569
"Hugged to its calm breast
the victims of all the wars.

1356
01:28:22,647 --> 01:28:25,378
"Calamity is in the tempest
of its history.

1357
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:27,851
"The breath of the evening breeze
came to cool...

1358
01:28:27,919 --> 01:28:29,580
"With the mulberry tree...

1359
01:28:29,654 --> 01:28:31,884
"Which sighed faintly...

1360
01:28:31,956 --> 01:28:34,789
"As if regretting
the passing of this man.

1361
01:28:34,859 --> 01:28:37,726
"This man of dark deeds
but of large heart...

1362
01:28:37,795 --> 01:28:40,389
"Who often at noonday
would lie down...

1363
01:28:40,465 --> 01:28:41,728
To sleep under its shade."

1364
01:28:43,668 --> 01:28:44,965
Okay.

1365
01:28:49,841 --> 01:28:51,673
Can I get you something to eat?

1366
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:54,578
No.

1367
01:28:55,613 --> 01:28:57,809
You want some water?

1368
01:29:00,551 --> 01:29:01,950
No.

1369
01:29:06,491 --> 01:29:08,960
Okay, well, I'll give you
your privacy.

1370
01:29:09,027 --> 01:29:10,426
No.

1371
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:16,161
I don't want my privacy.

1372
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:08,879
Mr. Church, I fell asleep
in this armchair.

1373
01:30:11,956 --> 01:30:13,651
Mr. Church?

1374
01:30:41,953 --> 01:30:43,682
Mr. Church?

1375
01:30:47,725 --> 01:30:49,523
Mr. Church...

1376
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,950
<i>People act strange around death.</i>

1377
01:31:22,226 --> 01:31:23,955
<i>There are those
who talk about everything...</i>

1378
01:31:24,028 --> 01:31:26,087
<i>But the person who died.</i>

1379
01:31:27,965 --> 01:31:31,560
<i>Those who talk about
only the person who died.</i>

1380
01:31:34,005 --> 01:31:35,837
<i>Those who fry to cheer you up.</i>

1381
01:31:38,109 --> 01:31:41,044
<i>And those who can'? Help
but make you cry.</i>

1382
01:31:48,853 --> 01:31:50,981
<i>And then there are those
who say nothing at all.</i>

1383
01:31:54,258 --> 01:31:56,124
<i>Because they don't have to.</i>

1384
01:32:10,274 --> 01:32:13,608
Yeah, of course.
Thank you so...

1385
01:32:13,678 --> 01:32:16,340
Thank you so much.
Excuse me one second.

1386
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:17,877
Excuse me.

1387
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:22,082
- Hi, can I help you?
- Sorry, ma'am.

1388
01:32:22,153 --> 01:32:23,780
Is this Mr. Church's wake?

1389
01:32:23,855 --> 01:32:25,687
Yes.

1390
01:32:25,756 --> 01:32:28,157
I was a friend.
Name's Frankie Twiggs.

1391
01:32:28,192 --> 01:32:29,626
Folks call me jelly.

1392
01:32:30,661 --> 01:32:31,958
Jelly?

1393
01:32:32,029 --> 01:32:33,622
I'm sorry for, you know,
barging in...

1394
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:36,156
But we hadn't seen hands
for quite some time...

1395
01:32:36,234 --> 01:32:37,644
And we done missed him,
and I just......

1396
01:32:37,668 --> 01:32:38,897
"Hands?"

1397
01:32:38,936 --> 01:32:42,634
Yeah, that's what we called him
on account of...

1398
01:32:42,707 --> 01:32:45,176
He played piano at my bar
for over 30 years.

1399
01:32:45,243 --> 01:32:47,302
So, he worked for you.

1400
01:32:47,411 --> 01:32:49,311
Oh, no, no.
Nothing like that.

1401
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:51,314
It was more for him, you know?

1402
01:32:51,349 --> 01:32:53,977
One night, he just wandered
over to the piano...

1403
01:32:54,051 --> 01:32:56,247
And then, bam,
he started playing.

1404
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,049
Place lit up.

1405
01:32:58,122 --> 01:33:00,022
I'm telling you,
this cat was good.

1406
01:33:00,091 --> 01:33:02,059
I thought somebody famous
had just walked in...

1407
01:33:02,126 --> 01:33:03,287
To get a drink, you know?

1408
01:33:03,361 --> 01:33:06,729
He was a whole lot of magic.

1409
01:33:08,099 --> 01:33:10,932
I'm Charlie.

1410
01:33:10,968 --> 01:33:13,733
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Charlie.

1411
01:33:13,804 --> 01:33:16,136
Izzy?

1412
01:33:16,207 --> 01:33:17,868
Come here, baby.

1413
01:33:17,942 --> 01:33:20,673
I want you to meet
a good friend of Mr. Church's.

1414
01:33:20,745 --> 01:33:22,804
Here, this is Mr. Church's recipe.

1415
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:24,440
What?

1416
01:33:24,715 --> 01:33:26,809
I didn't know he could cook.

1417
01:33:32,990 --> 01:33:34,754
This is Izzy.

1418
01:33:34,825 --> 01:33:37,226
- Can you say hi, baby?
- Hi.

1419
01:33:37,295 --> 01:33:39,889
This is Mr. jelly.

1420
01:33:39,964 --> 01:33:41,295
Twiggs.

1421
01:33:51,108 --> 01:33:52,769
<i>Mr. Church once said...</i>

1422
01:33:52,843 --> 01:33:55,437
<i>A book is meant to be read
from beginning to end...</i>

1423
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:58,774
<i>But is best understood
from end to beginning.</i>

1424
01:34:01,018 --> 01:34:03,885
<i>I suppose everything
does happen for a reason.</i>

1425
01:34:04,989 --> 01:34:06,320
<i>Mama dying.</i>

1426
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:09,052
<i>Larson saving my baby
and himself.</i>

1427
01:34:09,126 --> 01:34:11,993
<i>Poppy finding a Dollhouse
of her own.</i>

1428
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:13,724
<i>Even Owen...</i>

1429
01:34:13,764 --> 01:34:15,755
<i>The most beautiful 10-year-old boy...</i>

1430
01:34:15,833 --> 01:34:19,269
<i>On this or any other planet
becoming a doctor.</i>

1431
01:35:23,534 --> 01:35:25,263
<i>”Dear Charlotte.</i>

1432
01:35:25,336 --> 01:35:27,464
<i>"You've said you just want
to know me.</i>

1433
01:35:27,538 --> 01:35:31,475
<i>”My dear, you always have.</i>

1434
01:35:31,542 --> 01:35:33,943
<i>”I'm simply a man.</i>

1435
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:36,072
<i>'Wot without faults.</i>

1436
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:38,138
<i>'That can happen
when you're not the son...</i>

1437
01:35:38,215 --> 01:35:40,206
<i>”Your father hoped you'd be...</i>

1438
01:35:40,284 --> 01:35:42,946
<i>”Despite his verbal abuse
and beatings.</i>

1439
01:35:45,256 --> 01:35:46,533
<i>”I know you think
I took care of you...</i>

1440
01:35:46,557 --> 01:35:48,025
<i>”And your mother and Izzy...</i>

1441
01:35:48,092 --> 01:35:50,288
<i>”And you gave me nothing
in return.</i>

1442
01:35:52,129 --> 01:35:53,893
<i>"You gave me
the most important thing...</i>

1443
01:35:53,964 --> 01:35:55,022
<i>'Wife can offer.</i>

1444
01:35:57,835 --> 01:35:59,860
<i>"You gave me a family.</i>

1445
01:36:00,971 --> 01:36:03,030
<i>”And love.</i>

1446
01:36:05,042 --> 01:36:06,510
<i>Henry.”</i>

1447
01:36:27,932 --> 01:36:29,457
Mr. Church?

1448
01:36:36,907 --> 01:36:38,341
Henry?

1449
01:36:47,651 --> 01:36:49,346
I'm making eggs and grits, mama.

1450
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:51,479
Like Mr. Church showed us.

1451
01:36:51,555 --> 01:36:55,082
Oh, this looks so yummy.

1452
01:36:55,159 --> 01:36:56,558
Thank you.
Thank you.

1453
01:36:56,594 --> 01:36:58,289
Can you set the table for us'?

1454
01:36:58,362 --> 01:37:00,558
I can get plates.

1455
01:37:03,601 --> 01:37:07,094
Okay, this will be for me.
This will be for you.

1456
01:37:07,171 --> 01:37:08,915
What do you need?
You're adding a little salt.

1457
01:37:08,939 --> 01:37:10,304
What about cheese?
You need cheese?

1458
01:37:10,341 --> 01:37:11,638
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Here you go.

1459
01:37:14,044 --> 01:37:15,068
More cheese?

1460
01:37:40,538 --> 01:37:42,267
<i>I was wrong when I said...</i>

1461
01:37:42,339 --> 01:37:43,966
<i>The legacy of the Brooks family...</i>

1462
01:37:44,041 --> 01:37:45,600
<i>Is having babies out of wedlock.</i>

1463
01:37:46,177 --> 01:37:50,011
<i>The legacy of this family
is Mr. Church.</i>

1464
01:38:13,037 --> 01:38:15,028
<i>Henry Joseph Church
could have been anything...</i>

1465
01:38:15,105 --> 01:38:16,436
<i>He wanted to be.</i>

1466
01:38:17,107 --> 01:38:18,700
<i>He chose to cook.</i>

1467
01:38:19,743 --> 01:38:22,440
<i>The key, he said, jazz.</i>
