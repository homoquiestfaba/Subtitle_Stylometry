1
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,924
<i>A day and a half</i>
after Deep water Horizon exploded,

2
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,606
<i>the flames, fed by crude</i>
from the bottom of the sea,

3
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,728
<i>were simply too big to contain.</i>

4
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,201
<i>For the families</i>
of the 11 missing crew members,

5
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,328
<i>hope of their rescue is fading.</i>

6
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,529
<i>The search for survivors</i>
will end before dawn tomorrow.

7
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,728
<i>The forced</i>
feeding of mud and cement

8
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,848
<i>into the well failed to work.</i>

9
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,970
<i>The well continues to spew oil</i>
with the force of seven fire hoses.

10
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,647
<i>Today, that slick is 12 miles long,</i>
covering 100 square miles.

11
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,405
<i>Winds are coming</i>
from the south and they're strong,

12
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,802
<i>about 30 miles an hour,</i>
pushing that oil towards the coast.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,128
Congressman, all of our sites
are outlined here.

14
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,283
We've got our east operations
all the way up here.

15
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,930
Over here, our west operations.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,288
Up here we're working with local Indian
tribes to protect their burial grounds.

17
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,249
How you doing on boom supply?

18
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,800
Hard boom we clean and reuse,
so we're good there.

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,247
Soft boom needs to be replaced
when it's oil soaked, so...

20
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,163
demand is never ending.

21
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,681
It's something new.

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,604
It's something we had to figure out
on our own because we're shrimpers.

23
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,160
We didn't know nothing about
cleaning up oil until last week.

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,447
Floyd told me
you got six boats.

25
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,841
BP contract them all?
Two of them.

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,327
The other four shut down
because we ain't allowed to shrimp.

27
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,164
How much are they paying you?

28
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,402
1350 a day a boat.

29
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,326
And out of that I got to pay for
fuel, crew, all the other expenses.

30
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,688
Normally you'd be making what?
35? Yeah.

31
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,967
Going to have to start
laying off workers soon.

32
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,409
First Katrina took it away
and now BP.

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,802
What you going to do?

34
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,129
<i>The chair recognizes the</i>
gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Pryce.

35
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,009
<i>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</i>

36
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,004
<i>Today we saw reports</i>
that BP's spill in the Gulf

37
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,686
<i>has grown to nearly</i>
20 million gallons,

38
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,969
<i>which is roughly twice</i>
the size of Exxon Valdez.

39
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,841
<i>This is the most devastating man-made</i>
environmental disaster in U.S. History.

40
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,003
<i>It's also an economic</i>
and cultural disaster.

41
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,687
People of the Gulf Coast
will be living with this reality

42
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,003
long after the TV cameras
have gone home

43
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,845
and the nation's attention
has turned elsewhere.

44
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,288
Long after the politicians
have finished making their statements,

45
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,005
these people
will continue to suffer.

46
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,566
Today I'm not
a federal official.

47
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,611
Today I'm a resident
of the Louisiana Gulf Coast.

48
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,883
These fishermen,
these restaurant owners,

49
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,645
these folks who run the bait shops
and the corner stores,

50
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,724
they're people I grew up with.
They're people my parents grew up with.

51
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,963
People I look in the eye
every single day.

52
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,805
They've never asked
for a handout in their lives.

53
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,322
They've bled for this country, their sons
and daughters have bled for this country,

54
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,562
and right now
they need our help.

55
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,771
They need firm commitments
from BP and the government

56
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,081
that'll not just
help them rebuild,

57
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,209
but that'll assure them
we stand by their side.

58
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,760
That we have their backs
just like they've had ours.

59
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,811
Everything I know,
everything I love is at risk.

60
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,242
And even though these marshes
lie along coastal Louisiana...

61
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,168
these are America's wetlands.

62
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,801
And even though this is
British Petroleum's spill...

63
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,361
it is America's ocean.

64
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,603
Excuse me, I'd just like to submit the
rest of my statement for the record.

65
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,761
Thank you.

66
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,079
Been calling the house.

67
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,889
I needed time to clear my head.

68
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,530
That was quite
a show you put on.

69
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,125
It wasn't a show.
I dropped the lines

70
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,884
about the necessity
for a central czar.

71
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,201
Most important part of the speech.
You were honest.

72
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,521
And that's the way it came off.
No, I was weak.

73
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,320
You haven't heard.

74
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,521
Who else picked it up?
Everyone.

75
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,443
Today it appears
the sun is shining

76
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,000
on a Louisiana congressman
nobody knows.

77
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,079
You want to milk this.

78
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,447
I want to milk
the shit out of it

79
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,160
and ride it straight
into the Senate seat.

80
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,646
This is what
we've been waiting for.

81
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,088
You're not capitalizing
on the spill.

82
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,810
This...

83
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,001
This is you.

84
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,607
All right.
All right.

85
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,967
We're going to use this, Frank,

86
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,407
to ensure BP and Transocean

87
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,482
take responsibility
for what they've done.

88
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,847
Shine a light
in their goddamn faces.

89
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,329
You're on the 9:15
out of Reagan.

90
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,289
And Colin...

91
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,489
if we're going to do this,
we need to be buttoned up.

92
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,523
I want the Coast Guard
and the EPA closed to press.

93
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,571
But Frank explicitly said... I don't
care what Frank said. This is priority.

94
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,042
Let's keep this tasteful. Would
you consider 20/20 tasteful?

95
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,289
They're going to open
with you on June 15th.

96
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,488
It seems like this speech
is going to have some legs.

97
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,323
Congressman, care to
comment on yesterday's speech?

98
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,047
Jen, how you doing this morning?
Hanging in there, sir.

99
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,124
Unfortunately, the congressman requested
this be a closed-door meeting.

100
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,528
Sorry, folks.
Are you running for Senate?

101
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,524
Since you were last here, we've made
a significant number of changes.

102
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,285
Just trying to be more
aggressive containing the oil.

103
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,522
How often are you receiving
shipments of soft boom?

104
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,399
Not often enough.

105
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,448
<i>I'll</i> see what I can find
out and circle back.

106
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,649
If you need anything else, you call me.
You've got my personal number.

107
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,122
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

108
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,407
Enlighten me, Mr. Morris,
who do I need to call

109
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,847
to get trucks bringing in
soft boom every day?

110
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,651
Admiral Allen?
Goddamned president?

111
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,406
No, no, no. Believe me, I understand,
and I'm not trying to be rude.

112
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,879
I'm just sick
of all this posturing.

113
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,689
You don't think I've been
through this before?

114
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,445
Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike.

115
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,047
Thank you. That's all
I wanted to hear.

116
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,451
Louisiana needs
the oil industry

117
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,887
and the oil industry
needs Louisiana.

118
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,561
That was true 100 years ago
and it will be true in another 100 years.

119
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,486
The spill was a tragedy,

120
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,327
but it is in everyone's best interest
to keep American oil healthy.

121
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,446
My husband isn't
doubting how reliant

122
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,761
our local economy
is on industry.

123
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,931
My fund runs a diversified
energy portfolio

124
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,002
with an emphasis
on Gulf producers.

125
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,243
I know you've leaned left
on energy in the past,

126
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,126
but I'm looking to back a horse
that will support our interests.

127
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,129
You can find a lot
of politicians around here

128
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,163
in the party whose interests
align with yours.

129
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,766
Why me?
You're a winner.

130
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,563
People are talking about you, Congressman.
Even in my world.

131
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,723
Well, then, you should know
I don't pander to campaign financing.

132
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,691
Well, you won't win the Senate seat
unless you reconsider.

133
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,250
I'm sorry, I was under the
impression this was a lobby meeting.

134
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,402
We haven't decided
if we're going to run for Senate.

135
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,050
Colin, just hear him out.

136
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,646
We are in the middle
of a recession.

137
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,848
This election is going
to be about the economy.

138
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,924
And a moratorium will be
more devastating than the spill itself.

139
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,525
Mark, I don't think
you quite understand,

140
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,762
I'm not just advocating
for a temporary moratorium.

141
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,649
I think we ought
to phase out drilling altogether.

142
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,485
<i>Colin.</i>
Oil is an addiction.

143
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,804
And right now it's going to be pretty
damn tricky to deny how harmful it is,

144
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,531
how antiquated it is.

145
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,922
We need to develop
a sustainable infrastructure.

146
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,923
Mark, you're a man
with foresight.

147
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,607
You know green is how
we ought to be creating jobs.

148
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,206
Am I hearing
what I think I'm hearing?

149
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,085
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,849
We've wasted your time.

151
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,719
You're not going to win.

152
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,131
We'll see.

153
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,679
It's not smart.

154
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,287
You told him we're planning to run
before we've announced.

155
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,528
You humiliated me.

156
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,650
Do you have any idea how much
business my firm does with that man?

157
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,609
I didn't ask you to do that.

158
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,166
I won't be beholden
to Mark Lavin or anyone else.

159
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,925
<i>That speech was a godsend.</i>

160
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,209
Don't blow it.

161
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,799
What's wrong?

162
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,319
Nothing.

163
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,765
See you at home.

164
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,042
Frank told me you've been
calling the office.

165
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,600
Why would you do that?

166
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,887
What were you thinking, Lucy?

167
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,611
I'm sorry.

168
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,523
Terrence knows about us.

169
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,201
He came home drunk last night talking
all sorts of shit, and I don't know.

170
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,248
But don't worry,
he ain't going to say nothing.

171
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,330
I think you've had enough.

172
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,970
Don't you think you've
fucking had enough?

173
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,610
No.
I do.

174
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,724
Okay, I'm sorry, Lucy, okay?

175
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,290
I'm sorry.

176
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,169
I miss you, Colin.

177
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,449
Please.

178
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,721
Just sit with me.
Just for a minute. Please.

179
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,403
Tell it like it is, Pryce!

180
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,960
You've got my vote.
All right, brother.

181
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,128
<i># Sun come up #</i>

182
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,921
<i># It' was blue and gold #</i>

183
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,602
<i># Sun come up #</i>

184
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,928
<i># It' was blue and gold #</i>

185
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,364
<i># Sun come up #</i>

186
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,081
<i># It' was blue and gold... #</i>

187
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,608
You need to get ready.

188
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,809
Car is picking us up
in 15 minutes.

189
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,689
The Parish School Board fundraiser.

190
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,082
Sit with me for a minute.

191
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,966
Just one minute,
and I promise <i>I'll</i> cooperate.

192
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,529
Since when did we start
stocking the house with alcohol?

193
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,171
You've been sober for 16 years.

194
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,567
I think we're safe.

195
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,564
Besides, we can't all
get high on Diet Coke.

196
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,491
You remember
our first legislature run?

197
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,520
Planting posters at 2:00 a.m.
On the median of Highway 90?

198
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,409
Two kids,
fresh out of law school.

199
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,766
Colin...

200
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,206
I want you to see
someone with me.

201
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,444
I know you don't want to,
but we don't have a choice.

202
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,889
Did you have a choice

203
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,129
when you slept with that
27-year-old cheerleader coach?

204
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,239
Frank told you.

205
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,641
Who fucking cares who told me?

206
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,210
I'm sorry.

207
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,011
I was trying, Deb.
Believe me, I really was.

208
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,889
Do you expect me
to congratulate you

209
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,566
because you tried to keep
your dick in your pants?

210
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,848
What is it you want to hear?

211
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,323
That I'm fine you keep risking
everything we've worked for?

212
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,288
Not everything
is about our career.

213
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,242
I wish that were true.

214
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,683
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

215
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,605
All right, good job, girls.
Good job.

216
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,007
<i>Lucy Hall?</i>

217
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,284
Kara, take over for a couple minutes, okay?
Okay. No problem.

218
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,328
<i>I'm a reporter</i>
for the Lafitte Gazette.

219
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,209
<i>As uncomfortable as this is,</i>

220
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,204
I got to ask about your relationship
with Congressman Pryce.

221
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,011
There must be some mistake.

222
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,765
Honestly, I have no idea
who you're talking about.

223
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,447
You've been elected twice in a district
that is 60 percent African-American

224
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,689
and one that has historically elected
black officials since the Seventies.

225
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,730
<i>What do you think</i>
that says about you?

226
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,371
Well, I think it says
a lot about the city.

227
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,842
I took office in 2006
straight after Katrina.

228
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,322
People were rightfully
craving change.

229
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,961
Folks don't care what color your skin is
anymore, what your economic standing is.

230
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,324
What people want, what they need
is a leader to produce.

231
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,291
I spent eight years in the state
legislature, I did a term in city council.

232
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,522
My wife is a well-respected attorney
around here.

233
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,170
So I think
it's a matter of trust.

234
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,208
You grew up in a political family.
Yes, sir.

235
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,851
Your father, Rayne Pryce, was
mayor during the Seventies.

236
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,729
He created
numerous opportunities

237
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,279
for the city's
black population.

238
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,045
I'd imagine folk down here
still love your daddy, don't they?

239
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,168
Yes, they do.
Very much.

240
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,004
Needless to say,
the Civil Rights Movement

241
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,684
wasn't popular
in the South back then.

242
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,889
What he did, it took guts.

243
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,440
Talk to me about
his post-mayoral career.

244
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,731
It's no secret that Rayne lost
three consecutive Senate elections

245
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,724
and was involved
in a number of incidents.

246
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,006
What happened to him?

247
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,086
My father
is an alcoholic, Byron.

248
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,288
<i>No one is</i>
available to take your call.

249
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,089
<i>Please leave a mess...</i>

250
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,563
Come on, Colin.
Come on.

251
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,842
Let's focus on the
fact that for the first time

252
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,366
since the storm, people are
moving back into the city.

253
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,681
Which makes the spill
that much more devastating.

254
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,326
Right. And that's precisely
why we need to remain vigilant,

255
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,044
why we need to hold
all parties accountable.

256
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,966
Now, BP has vowed to pay
all legitimate claims,

257
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,771
but folks don't have a lot of room
to wait around for checks to come

258
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,808
or I should say
not to come in the mail.

259
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,645
And I want people to know
I'm going to be there for them.

260
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,485
Get rid of that suit.

261
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,611
Whoa, don't touch that oil
with your bare hands.

262
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,603
Use some gloves, man.

263
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,843
All right, we're taking off
in 15 minutes, fellas.

264
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,604
Terrence?

265
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,011
Terrence Hall?

266
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,891
What's next for you? Any plans
to run, say, for the Senate?

267
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,884
Well, that's a ways off. Right now
we need to focus on the oil spill.

268
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,769
Right now I have
a job representing

269
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,286
the Second District
of Louisiana in Congress.

270
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,203
I think we have enough here.

271
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,248
It's been a real pleasure.
Thank you, Colin.

272
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,681
Thank you for having me, Byron.
Yes, sir.

273
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,603
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

274
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,130
He's in the kitchen.

275
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,725
How long before
a major picks this up?

276
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,044
I'd give it until the morning.

277
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,930
People are going to think he knew
that slut was the fisherman's wife.

278
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,571
She's right. They're going to
think he knew the fisherman.

279
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,921
Terrence.
What?

280
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,402
The fisherman.
His name is Terrence Hall.

281
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,605
An NBC affiliate has footage
of me speaking at his oyster company.

282
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,889
That's how I met the girl.

283
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,521
We'll start polling damage
first thing in the morning.

284
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,763
Well, I'm going to have to come
clean, so set a press conference.

285
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,841
I think we should
hold off on that.

286
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,048
I think we need to see how
this is going to play out.

287
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,407
Why? You think it's
going to blow over?

288
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,801
No, I don't think
it's going to blow over,

289
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,321
but I think it's possible
that we can weather this.

290
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,562
Frank, it's not like
my husband committed a crime.

291
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,725
With all due respect, have you
forgotten what's going on out there?

292
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,959
How do you think
it's going to look

293
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,122
when people find out
that Congressman Pryce,

294
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,726
the superhero
of the BP oil spill

295
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,286
is fucking the wife
of a local fisherman,

296
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,089
the black wife
of a black local fisherman?

297
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,685
How do you think
that's going to look?

298
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,489
You're being dramatic.
Oh, am I?

299
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,039
This is going to snowball.

300
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,283
Colin is not going to have
one solitary friend in Washington.

301
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,206
Not with every person in America
having watched him cry

302
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,931
on national television
five days ago.

303
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,321
Maybe you're right.

304
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,129
But we need to stay cool.

305
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,807
Think about Owens
and the prostitution scandal.

306
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,083
That was less than a year ago.
This is Louisiana.

307
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,124
Owens was re-elected.
We're not going to be in November.

308
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,851
Colin is a white congressman
in a black district.

309
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,491
He can barely win here
with nothing hanging over him.

310
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,450
That's why the Senate made sense,
where there are at least white voters.

311
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,488
Still does.

312
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,051
What's on for tomorrow?

313
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,884
The claims fair. That's right.
The claims fair.

314
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,406
The release go out yet?
No, not yet.

315
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,528
Well, let's see that it does.

316
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,331
That's what you should
be focusing on.

317
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,404
Not this bullshit.

318
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,088
Come on, let's get some sleep.

319
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,689
Yeah?

320
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,321
<i>Hi, Congressman Pryce?</i>
Hi, it's Jen Wyman.

321
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,759
Who?

322
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,285
<i>It's Jen.</i>

323
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,203
Lieutenant Wyman
from the Coast Guard?

324
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,009
Oh, Jen, of course.

325
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,651
<i>What's on your mind?</i>
We got a real problem here.

326
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,362
We haven't received a shipment of soft boom
in over a week, and we're running real low.

327
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,966
Projections show the oil moving
west and we don't have enough

328
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,361
<i>to protect the western coastline</i>
of Mississippi.

329
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,283
I'm sorry to call
on your personal line, sir,

330
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,806
but you did say to reach out
if there's an emergency.

331
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,160
You haven't heard
what's been going on?

332
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,211
<i>What's wrong, sir?</i>

333
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,650
I'm going to put you in touch
with my friend, Dave Erikson,

334
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,122
President of Plaquemines Parish.
He'll be able to help you.

335
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,841
<i>Bernadette, you're on in three...</i>

336
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,491
<i>Over the weekend,</i>
calls for a resignation

337
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,324
<i>have intensified with statements</i>

338
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,290
<i>from the House Minority Leader</i>
and National Committee Chair.

339
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,601
Both said a temporary
leave of absence is not enough.

340
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,762
This has become
a sensational story,

341
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,207
a symbol to many of everything
that's wrong in Washington.

342
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,046
Louisiana simply can't
afford to face this disaster

343
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,408
with a scandal that could distract
from the real problems at hand.

344
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,161
Price couldn't even attend
his own claims fair.

345
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,402
Thank you, Jimmy.
All right, sir.

346
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,839
Long time, Pryce.

347
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,922
Oh, how's the wife, Stan?

348
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,681
Busting my balls as usual.
That's what they do.

349
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,764
Mm-hmm. Got anything for me? How's your son doing?
Is he going to resign?

350
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,810
Did he know she was
the fisherman's wife?

351
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,530
Just remember this, folks,

352
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,843
Louisiana has always been
one big family.

353
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,362
And we don't abandon our family
when they make a mistake.

354
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,604
I wouldn't be standing here today
if that truth failed to exist.

355
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,523
Thank you. Mr. Pryce!

356
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,327
Now, Moulay Ismail,
that Moroccan ruler,

357
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,971
fathered 900 children
with his concubines.

358
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,646
900 children.

359
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,611
Genghis Khan, well,
he made old Ismail look barren.

360
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,969
One out of every 200 men
on this planet has a direct line

361
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,650
stretching back
to that son of a bitch.

362
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,290
Is that right? Yeah.

363
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,682
What's your point, Dad? Point
is, a lot of powerful men,

364
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:53,484
JFK, FDR, Clinton,
behave the same way.

365
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,564
Now, I was never much
of a philanderer when I was in office,

366
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,325
but I get where
you're coming from.

367
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,084
No offense, Miss Deborah.

368
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,605
All right, that's enough.

369
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,841
What am I doing here?

370
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,481
I haven't heard from you
for over a year,

371
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,882
now you want me
to be a part of this fiasco?

372
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,811
I didn't invite you.

373
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,366
Rayne, seeing as how you're uniquely
qualified on the subject of scandals,

374
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,284
why don't you give
your son some advice?

375
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,964
Want my advice?

376
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,929
Fuck them.

377
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,083
Fuck the party.
Fuck the administration.

378
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,679
Hell, fuck the people.

379
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,127
This spill will be over soon,
and they'll forgive you.

380
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,328
You just got to fight
through it like a man.

381
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,041
Something funny about what I said?
Like a man?

382
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,963
We're in the middle
of a disaster here.

383
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,771
People are suffering
and I can't even leave my house.

384
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,888
I've already left
these people out to dry.

385
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,610
This ain't about
you doing your job...

386
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,842
Of course not.
It was never about that for you.

387
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,880
I was the best mayor this city ever had.
And then you lost again and again.

388
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,570
Why are you here?
Why is he here?

389
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,291
Colin, I understand you're
under an enormous amount of pressure,

390
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,169
but you need to think
about yourself,

391
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,242
and you need to think about us.

392
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,047
Colin, look at me.

393
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,164
Look at me!

394
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,001
You're not going to resign.

395
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,163
I've decided to resign.

396
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,722
I think you're
doing the right thing.

397
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,848
I need you to help me
get through this.

398
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,729
Why? It's over.

399
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,529
I'm not retiring.

400
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,809
We'll miss the Senate
run, I know that, but...

401
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,082
after the spill's over.

402
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,409
Look, I can't name anyone
who has come back

403
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,482
after a resignation
and been elected again.

404
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,683
You need to think about doing
something else with your life.

405
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,849
You remember why I hired you?

406
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,122
Because my father
worked for your father

407
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,924
and you thought
he was a miracle worker?

408
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,685
No, that's why I sought you out.
Why'd I hire you?

409
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,603
What'd I tell you when we met?
Colin, please.

410
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,681
What'd I say?

411
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,169
That I don't have
my head up my ass

412
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,925
like those other
Beltway pricks.

413
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,490
I trust you, Kate.

414
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,810
You want some free advice?

415
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,566
Stay out of the press.

416
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,445
Stay out of the press
for a long time.

417
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,320
Give people time
to forgive you.

418
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,679
How long are we talking?

419
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,843
I don't know.
You are in unchartered waters.

420
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,444
<i>Congressman, the public would like</i>
to hear your side of the story!

421
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,966
<i>Congressman Pryce,</i>
when will you step down?

422
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,049
I don't know
what hurts more...

423
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,920
The fact that
you're stepping down

424
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,765
or that I wasn't
the first person you told.

425
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,727
This isn't about the spill.

426
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,721
Or the people or you not
being able to do your job.

427
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,090
You're just scared.

428
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,290
You're just scared everyone
will stop loving you.

429
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,842
Your whores, your father,
your constituents.

430
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,763
It's all the same.
Stop.

431
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,285
Would you just stop?

432
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,642
I don't care
about this city anymore.

433
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,324
If you resign...

434
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,845
I'm going to leave you.

435
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,570
Good afternoon.

436
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,928
<i>Let's get some reaction</i>
now to what we've been hearing

437
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,519
<i>from Senator Tom Owens</i>
of Louisiana,

438
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,488
<i>whose state, of course,</i>
has been the hardest hit.

439
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,927
<i>What's your immediate</i>
reaction, Senator?

440
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,561
<i>Hallelujah. Let's hope that the</i>
spill has indeed been contained.

441
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,041
<i>Let's hope this cap holds</i>
and they can finally

442
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,964
<i>- kill that well and stop the flow of oil.</i>
- 87 days.

443
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,327
<i>That's, of course, how long</i>
this has all been unfolding.

444
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,004
<i>Give us a little bit</i>
of a sense of what

445
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,560
<i>the Gulf Coast residents</i>
are feeling right now.

446
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,961
<i>Well, there</i>
is a sense of relief, sure.

447
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,646
<i>But what you have to understand</i>
is right now folks are concerned

448
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,643
<i>with where their next</i>
paycheck is coming from,

449
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,484
<i>how they're going</i>
to pay their mortgage,

450
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,449
<i>how they're going</i>
to put food on the table.

451
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,491
<i>For us right now this is only the</i>
beginning of a long rebuilding process.

452
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,643
<i>And we're all just</i>
a little numb right now.

453
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,087
<i>But yes, this is</i>
certainly good news, Wolf.

454
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,483
<i>Colin, it's me.</i>
Pick up if you're there.

455
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,164
<i>I'm reminding you</i>
about your 9:00 a.m.

456
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,811
<i>With Grandalf's</i>
Fisherman's Co-op.

457
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,202
<i>I'm hoping you're already on your way.</i>
Please don't be late again.

458
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,248
<i>Anyway, I'll see you</i>
at the foundation.

459
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,203
We try shrimping,

460
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,280
but since the spill,
there ain't nothing out there.

461
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,727
And I could have a boat
on the water for three hours,

462
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,485
it comes back with barely enough
to make a gumbo with.

463
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,040
People think it don't hurt
because they capped the well

464
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,439
and they cleaning up
and all that,

465
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,169
but I ain't never seen the
water this dead before.

466
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,244
I sympathize,
Mr. Provich, I do.

467
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,130
But Louisiana National simply
isn't in a position to help.

468
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,329
Seems to me this is a matter you should
take up with the claims fund BP set up.

469
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,691
Claims process is fucked.

470
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,359
Excuse my English.

471
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,488
Ain't none of us
got a penny from BP

472
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,847
since the emergency funding
back in May.

473
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,605
I'm sorry to hear that, but
we have a policy... A policy?

474
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,808
I've had to lay off
half my workers.

475
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,089
We've been clients
of National for 15 years.

476
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,481
We just looking
for a little help.

477
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,723
Please, let's all calm down.
Sorry I'm late.

478
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,723
I'd like a word
with Mr. Musgrave

479
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,603
if it's all right with y'all.

480
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,482
Now, Bill,
over the past few months,

481
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,360
my organization has been providing
legal counsel to the cooperative.

482
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,091
Forgive me, Mr. Pryce,
I'm not familiar with your organization.

483
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,561
It's a New Orleans
based nonprofit, pro bono

484
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,967
for small business owners
affected by the spill.

485
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,849
I'm their attorney.

486
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,608
Now, this is our proposal
to uniformly restructure

487
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,251
the co-op's boat
and real estate mortgages.

488
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,606
This is BP's obligation,
not ours.

489
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,969
You know damn well these men aren't getting
any payments from the GCCF anytime soon.

490
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,691
They're already in default,
and if you don't come through,

491
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,444
they won't make it
through another season.

492
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,205
If you foreclose,
the liquidation value

493
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,365
will be less than keeping these fishermen
in business while the industry recovers.

494
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,410
This is very much
in your interest as well.

495
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,086
It's too low.

496
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,164
Well, what are our options?

497
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,005
File for Chapter 11.

498
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,003
It's not ideal,
but it'll allow us

499
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,481
to have your assets
revalued in bankruptcy court,

500
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,642
which would force National
to cooperate.

501
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,371
We don't want to go down that road.
<i>It'll</i> taint our names.

502
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,331
I understand, Hal. But at this
point it's all about surviving.

503
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,402
You can handle this?

504
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,724
I have a number of clients in the
same position as your co-op, Hal.

505
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,566
Hotels, restaurants,
even a used car salesman in Lafitte.

506
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,405
It's going to take money
and it's going to take manpower.

507
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,926
Yeah, money you ain't got.

508
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,365
I'm working on it.

509
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,527
Thank you, Colin.

510
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,086
Mr. Pryce,
I'm from The Daily Kingfish.

511
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,447
I already told you guys,
I'm not doing interviews.

512
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,003
The story's on the GCCF. The focus
will be on your foundation.

513
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,163
Do you think it'll be enough
to get you re-elected someday, Mr. Pryce?

514
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,208
Don't be a jackass.

515
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,888
Sorry, we're running
a little behind today.

516
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,361
We'll be with you
as soon as we can.

517
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,726
Morning.

518
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,488
We're backed up out there.
How about a little help?

519
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,685
This is the proposal
for Billick Canner to outsource.

520
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,282
How high?

521
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,011
Did you explain to Billick
that this is for fucking charity?

522
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,129
And I politely reminded him
that you were his mentor at Tulane.

523
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,721
Even if we get Billick
down to 100 an hour,

524
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,168
we still need 200 here to take the
fishery co-op through bankruptcy.

525
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,722
And that doesn't include the
restaurant groups or anyone else.

526
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,491
I'll wire more money.
You don't have more money.

527
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,245
I have enough to bring on a few more
employees to help with the raise.

528
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,322
The raise?
Maybe that would make sense

529
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,324
if we had even a modicum of
success with our current setup.

530
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,768
It's just difficult because
of your... My what?

531
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,005
My reputation?

532
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,165
You're not thinking clearly.

533
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,529
It's a great cause.

534
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,284
It's just not working.

535
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,369
<i>BP's compensation fund</i>
has made a final settlement payment

536
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,489
<i>to one out of 91,000 people</i>
waiting for checks,

537
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,645
and that was a $10 million
payout to a BP business partner.

538
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,725
The talk line
is 555-261-1677.

539
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,601
Of course, today, our guest is Louisiana
Attorney General Chris Wilcox.

540
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,046
There have been rumors that you would
support a permanent ban on drilling.

541
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,559
Those aren't just rumors.

542
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,642
Some would call that
a radical position.

543
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,644
It's radical to those who haven't
researched alternative energy.

544
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,883
No one's saying it's going to
be easy, but mark my words,

545
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,965
the green energy revolution is going
to dwarf the technology revolution.

546
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,641
We need to be forward thinking.
Let's go.

547
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,166
And quite frankly,
we don't have any time to waste.

548
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,170
But I heard Wilcox is going to run for Senate.
He hasn't decided that.

549
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,323
That's funny, because I heard
you're going to run his campaign.

550
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,362
It's a small town.

551
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,726
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

552
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,842
So, what do you have in mind? Consultant.
We'd keep it dark.

553
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,322
And what do you get out of being a shadow
consultant for Wilcox's Senate campaign?

554
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,879
I do good work for Chris,

555
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,089
maybe he gives me
a position down the line.

556
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,002
Can I get you two something else? Yes, ma'am.
<i>I'll</i> have another Diet Coke.

557
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,445
I'm good.

558
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,200
Sure you don't want a beer?

559
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,088
Or a bourbon?

560
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,444
It's a small town.

561
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,091
I'm fine.

562
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,924
Trust me, I'm fine.

563
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,809
It's too risky.

564
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,360
If word gets out,
the campaign could be damaged.

565
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,329
We've known each other
since high school.

566
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,764
I'm asking you for a favor.

567
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,921
Nine months.
It's just been nine months.

568
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,359
Kate!

569
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,604
Kate, God damn it,
I completely forgot.

570
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,886
It's fine.

571
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,128
I have a 6:00 p.m., so we
don't have a lot of time.

572
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,439
How long are you in town for?

573
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,408
I'm leaving in the morning.

574
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,687
Do you have dinner plans?
Let me take you to Cochon.

575
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,764
No. I mean, yes.
I can't tonight.

576
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,968
Mostly bloggers and local.

577
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,889
It's what you'd expect.

578
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,002
Speculation about
a return to politics,

579
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,367
questions about the motives
behind your organization.

580
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,920
And people calling me
a narcissistic asshole.

581
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,080
I warned you the press
was going to spin it this way.

582
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,168
You didn't wait long enough
for the dust to settle.

583
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,890
At least you haven't
commented publicly.

584
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,760
I just don't understand how my work
can be construed as a negative.

585
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,287
I mean, this isn't
some resume builder, Kate.

586
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,044
Then why do you
have a publicist?

587
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,964
No good deed goes unscrutinzed?

588
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,202
Not when you're a politician.

589
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,049
How are you, Kate?
Me?

590
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,726
I'm great.

591
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,485
Everything is great.

592
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,449
Do you really want
to know how I am?

593
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,568
Yeah.
Well...

594
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,046
Let's see, my husband and I
recently separated.

595
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,009
I'm thinking of leaving my job.

596
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,290
My kids are a pain in the ass.

597
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,091
Other than that, I'm great.

598
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,204
Oh, come on, blow off your 6:00 p.m.
And get a drink with me.

599
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,241
You don't want to be burdened by some
37-year-old woman's midlife crisis, believe me.

600
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,362
Let's get back to it, shall we?

601
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,283
You're only 37?
Fuck off.

602
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,925
Is it terrible that
I'm drinking with you?

603
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,685
How loose is your definition
of terrible?

604
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,891
You're not going to end up...

605
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,362
passed out naked
in some doorway?

606
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,011
No, it was never like that.

607
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:33,961
Well, maybe a couple of times.

608
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,045
No, I was a functioning alcoholic
until I wasn't.

609
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,601
You know, sometimes I look back on
my life, what was driving my life,

610
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,445
Jesus, I don't know,

611
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,764
with all the campaigning
and the meetings

612
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,729
and the speeches...

613
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,005
I just miss it, you know?

614
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,401
This will get easier.

615
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,447
We said we wouldn't do this.

616
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,480
You're a real special one,
you know that?

617
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,207
Hey, Maria.
Ls Mrs. Pryce home?

618
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,681
I'm sorry, Mr. Pryce.
She's still at the office.

619
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,486
She asked me to come by and drop
off these papers from the lawyers.

620
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,689
It's good to see you, Mr. Pryce.
You, too.

621
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,410
<i>Colin.</i>

622
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,688
<i>Colin.</i>

623
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,439
Hello, James.

624
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,090
How you doing?

625
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,049
I spoke to your doctor.

626
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,690
You're going
to need to have surgery.

627
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,364
What for?

628
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,649
70 percent of my liver
has stopped dead.

629
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,286
I'm making arrangements
to take care of the bills.

630
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,448
I don't want your damn money.

631
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,842
You're in the red from
financing your last campaign.

632
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,763
You don't have any money, Dad.

633
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,968
Well, don't shit your pants.

634
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,488
You ain't going to be saddled
with my debt or my fiascos.

635
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,407
I wouldn't do that
to your wife.

636
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,362
Yeah.

637
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,528
How's that pro bono work going?

638
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,119
Could be worse.

639
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,088
Not what I heard.

640
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,164
My advice is stop
spending your own money.

641
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,651
Keep it simple.

642
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,809
You don't have to be the hero.

643
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,609
You just have
to make it look good.

644
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,087
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

645
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,242
You know, it's funny.

646
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:43,962
I walk around this city, people
come up to me to shake my hand,

647
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,931
want to thank me for doing the things
I did for them while I was mayor.

648
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,446
They don't remember
anything after that.

649
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,444
The speeches I gave
under the influence.

650
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,047
That fucking spitting incident.

651
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,925
None of it.

652
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:05,444
Yes, sir. Louisiana
is a mighty funny place.

653
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,000
You'll be back
on that horse soon enough.

654
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,924
Is that what you think this is?

655
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,968
Some sort of publicity stunt?

656
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,644
Well, ain't it?

657
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,687
You mind getting me some more?

658
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,087
You shouldn't be drinking
or smoking for that matter.

659
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,041
You sound
just like your mother.

660
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,329
May she rest in peace.

661
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,006
What?

662
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,442
You may hate my guts,

663
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,364
but you turned out all right.

664
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,125
After all, the apple
didn't fall too far.

665
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,360
You really think you're better
than me, don't you?

666
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,050
No, I don't.

667
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,805
But I'm nothing like you.

668
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,443
Hey there.
You're up early.

669
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,124
<i>I had a dream about you.</i>

670
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,567
Really?

671
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,166
We were
in high school together.

672
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,370
But we looked the same.
Middle-aged high-schoolers.

673
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,490
<i>I was asking you to the prom or</i>
something, I don't remember exactly.

674
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,804
You were nervous and blushing,

675
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,281
and I gave you
one hell of a kiss.

676
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,884
Did we go to prom together?

677
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,123
I don't know.
You sped off crying.

678
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,407
That sounds about right.

679
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,361
Listen, what would you think about coming
down here for a few days to visit?

680
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,091
Come on.
Shoes off, please.

681
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,168
I want my damned pancakes.

682
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,971
Watch your mouth.
Yeah, shut up, Robbie.

683
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,730
How about this weekend?

684
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,561
This weekend?

685
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,919
This weekend's good.

686
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,730
Okay, I got to run.
I will call you later.

687
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,205
Okay.

688
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,564
Colin!

689
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,123
Colin!

690
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,841
At 7:00 a.m. I get a call
from Gail Dixon with the GCCF.

691
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,399
She's in Feinberg's office.

692
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,961
She tells me BP admires the
work the foundation is doing

693
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,163
and has decided to give us
a $3.5 million grant.

694
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,084
Three million
for existing clients' claims,

695
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,288
and the remainder
for their bankruptcy needs.

696
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,687
This right here is too good to be true.
That's what I thought.

697
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,239
So I get to the office,

698
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,208
I log into
the donation account,

699
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,961
and the money is there. The
numbers match up. But why us?

700
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,520
There's got to be ten other
organizations just like ours.

701
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,887
Publicity? Exactly.
So if you're BP,

702
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,406
why associate yourself
with a disgraced politician?

703
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,919
Muddles the story.

704
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,684
But this barely
touches on the scandal.

705
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,610
Do you want
to send back the money?

706
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,840
Hell, no.

707
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,121
I poked around
with a BP publicist.

708
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,725
She didn't know
who authorized the grant,

709
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,883
but she thought it would ignite a
wave of funding, which makes sense.

710
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,645
I mean, the GCCF's been hit
with a ton of criticism.

711
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,688
Yeah, okay.
Then why start with me?

712
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,604
Who knows? Who cares?
Just be thankful.

713
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,160
This is a blessing for your
foundation and your image.

714
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,004
And I know the press
have taken their shots,

715
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,970
but you are coming off
of this a winner.

716
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,530
All right, enough about work.

717
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,959
So, what's the plan?

718
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,644
Are you hungry?

719
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,331
Client of mine's having
a barbecue in Grand Isle.

720
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,244
The fishing village?
Yeah, the fishing village.

721
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,845
Who do you think
my clients are?

722
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,444
Only kind of seafood
won't kill you these days.

723
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,000
You got your potatos,
you got your corns,

724
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,809
little bit of crab oil,
some garlic,

725
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,689
then you got your Cajun spices,

726
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,809
and God help you if you
get this in your eyeball.

727
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,479
And once you get it
smoking real good,

728
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,039
then you know
you got yourself a boil.

729
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,008
You married
quite the chef, huh?

730
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,651
No, there ain't a man in Louisiana
don't know how to cook.

731
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,724
Oh, she got a mouth on her.
What? It's true.

732
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,325
Y'all want a beer?

733
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,479
You have a soda or something?

734
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,482
What, you don't drink?
Trying not to.

735
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,210
Oh. Me, too.

736
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,719
Can I tell you something?

737
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,999
Sure.

738
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,765
I think you got a bum deal.
Lay...

739
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,087
I mean, you got that
son of a bitch Senator Owens

740
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,731
sleeping with hookers.
He keeps getting elected.

741
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,485
You, you cheated on your wife.
Big fucking deal.

742
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,291
I mean, people are broke,
sick with the dispersants,

743
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,284
you're the only one down here
doing a goddamn thing for us.

744
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,610
Can I help you
with those drinks?

745
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,170
Sure.

746
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,764
That lady of yours,
she's something else.

747
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,446
No, no. We just
work together, Hal.

748
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,531
I heard you was
rattling cages over at BP.

749
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,523
Looks like we're in business.

750
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:46,208
I think more like
we ain't out of business yet.

751
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,244
You done good, Congressman.

752
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,528
<i>In beaking</i>
news, yet another scandal

753
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,080
<i>is sending shockwaves</i>
through our nation's capital.

754
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,731
<i>This one involving two-term</i>
Republican Senator Tom Owens

755
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,088
<i>of Louisiana who was detained</i>
by federal agents late last night.

756
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,686
<i>On Saturday morning</i>
FBI agents raided

757
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,411
<i>Senator Owens' Washington, D.C.</i>
And Metairie homes

758
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,369
<i>as part of an ongoing</i>
corruption probe.

759
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,688
<i>Sources familiar with</i>
the investigation said investigators

760
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,161
<i>are looking into whether Owens</i>
used his influence... Yeah?

761
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,561
<i>In various business dealings.</i>

762
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,086
<i>Who'? No formal charges</i>
have been filed against me.

763
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,209
<i>We don't know the extent or the</i>
precise nature of this investigation,

764
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,766
<i>but I am cooperating</i>
with the authorities fully and...

765
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,888
3:00 p.m. Works.
Uh-huh.

766
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,087
Who was that?

767
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,960
Mark will just be a minute.
Can I get you something to drink?

768
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,809
No, thanks, I'm fine.

769
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,484
Hello.

770
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,799
Sorry, honey.

771
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,371
No, you cannot go
to the Kanye concert alone.

772
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,681
Janie is not an adult.

773
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,762
160,000 cash.
That's what the Feds

774
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,491
found in the attic
of Owens' Georgetown home.

775
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:12,291
Your stepfather can take you.

776
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,166
He's cool.
He's hip.

777
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,523
Okay, pumpkin.
All right, love you.

778
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,207
My daughter is 14.

779
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,248
What else do you know
about Tom Owens?

780
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:29,166
I know that he took a bribe
from a Florida businessman.

781
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,402
Tom's going to resign?
No.

782
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,290
The investigation could take 18
months, and if Owens decides

783
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:37,489
to fight, which he will,
a conviction could take years.

784
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:41,849
What's the problem, then? Tom may not be in
the party, but he supports your interests.

785
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,321
It's not Owens
I'm worried about.

786
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,802
It's Chris Wilcox.

787
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,166
He's going to beat him.

788
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,601
You know I can't win.
Really?

789
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,603
Well, our polls
are telling us differently.

790
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,446
Seems the public would be
receptive to your running.

791
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:06,206
You just need the right spin
and a machine to spin it.

792
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,849
You authorized that grant.

793
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:13,611
Being one of BP's most influential
shareholders has its perks.

794
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,002
So you had them donate
$3.5 million into my foundation

795
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,650
to test the waters
for a Senate run?

796
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,324
What's it to them?

797
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,846
Who's going
to finance the campaign? BP?

798
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,685
No. I am.

799
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:33,210
We need someone from Louisiana
fighting for our side.

800
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,169
And you think it makes
a hell of a story,

801
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,164
Colin Pryce, working to bridge
the gap between BP

802
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,089
and all the hardworking folks
of Louisiana.

803
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,845
This goes way beyond BP.

804
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,321
This is about
the entire industry.

805
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,562
This is about
protecting investments.

806
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:51,008
The next few years,
every major oil and gas company

807
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,606
will be spending
more and more token money

808
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,162
on alternative energy
and safe drilling.

809
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,121
Billions of ad dollars will be
spent to cleanse their images.

810
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,363
And we'll make sure that
you're in the center of it all.

811
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,519
A hero.

812
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:10,161
But you're not just asking me
to change my energy position.

813
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,846
You're asking me to turn my
back on the claims process.

814
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,199
Look at it this way,

815
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,886
if it's not you,
we'll find someone else.

816
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,922
Chris Wilcox
is not going to win.

817
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,439
You can bet on that.

818
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,488
What makes you think
I'd do this?

819
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,644
You're standing here.

820
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,602
You want to know
how I rationalize it?

821
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,091
I ask myself,
would I rather that claims money

822
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,925
be in the hands of a bunch
of podunk fishermen

823
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,048
or invested back
into the economy

824
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:42,205
by a corporation who's been creating
jobs down here since before I was born.

825
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,203
As for a moratorium,

826
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,124
that is just not
economically sound for anyone.

827
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,248
Thank you for your time.

828
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,608
You know what I always found most
interesting about politicians

829
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,967
is that they're so blinded
by delusions of grandeur

830
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,963
that they forget
who they really are.

831
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,801
In your case, the only thing anyone
is going to remember about you

832
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,565
is that you fucked
a fisherman's wife.

833
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:22,167
Most people
won't even remember that.

834
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,049
You're going to need
someone like me, Colin.

835
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,724
I know.

836
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,804
I know what you're thinking.

837
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,081
It's really not my place.

838
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,603
I'm not going
to work with him, Kate.

839
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,479
Then why take the meeting?

840
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,847
Because I at least needed to...

841
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,685
Hear him out? Why?

842
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:32,762
Even if I never resigned, I still
wouldn't have won that Senate seat.

843
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,763
They were always
maneuvering me.

844
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,359
I was in denial.

845
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,203
That's not true.

846
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,049
You stand for something.

847
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,163
Will you stay
for a couple more days?

848
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,844
I wish I could.

849
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:54,002
But unfortunately
I have work and...

850
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,970
children. So...

851
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:00,965
Well, what would you think about me
coming up there to visit you soon?

852
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,804
I could spend time
with your kids.

853
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,008
I'm not divorced yet, Colin.

854
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,447
And neither are you.

855
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,488
You know damn well
it's right with us.

856
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,003
What about your career?

857
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,366
Do you have any idea
what this would look like?

858
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,250
We've already been
incredibly reckless.

859
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,769
This feels real to me.

860
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,850
And if it means
I can't run for office again,

861
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,729
so be it.

862
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,320
I thought I was taking you
to the airport.

863
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,999
I called a cab.

864
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,968
I figured I'd let you sleep.

865
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,721
Folks, the grant was given to us
for claims we already submitted.

866
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,164
Are any of you
existing clients?

867
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,005
Meaning people
we worked with in the past?

868
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,208
All right, who's next?

869
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,481
We had to treat
your father's alcohol withdrawal

870
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,046
to maximize the safety
of his surgery.

871
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,639
Detox.

872
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,449
Detox was kind
of rocky for him.

873
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,841
Both emotionally
and physically.

874
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:12,049
We're going to take him
into the OR about 40 minutes.

875
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:15,966
The surgery should take
five to seven hours.

876
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,690
Take your time
with him until then.

877
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,842
Thank you.
Yeah.

878
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,801
Heard you were in the middle
of a class action.

879
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,326
I didn't think you'd be here.

880
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,767
I postponed the depositions,
but I have to get back

881
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,729
to the office during surgery.

882
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,209
He's my father, too.

883
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,130
<i>I'll</i> be outside.

884
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,404
How are you feeling?

885
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,167
Ask me that in seven hours.

886
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,525
You're going to be okay.

887
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:47,361
You know, I was thinking
about something on the ride over.

888
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,728
You remember that speech you
gave during the '69 campaign

889
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,361
about the anti-discrimination
ordinance, you remember?

890
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:59,841
You were shouting,
pounding your fist,

891
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,570
spitting like a mad dog.

892
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:09,046
I was too young to understand
much of what you were saying,

893
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:13,523
but I did understand
it was about race.

894
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,568
Blacks and whites,
right and wrong.

895
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:22,521
And I never...
Do...

896
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:26,605
Do me a favor, Colin.

897
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,808
What?

898
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,281
Don't feel sorry for me.

899
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,008
Oh, Christ.

900
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,651
All right.

901
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,887
Close the damn shades.

902
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,088
The sun is hurting my eyes.

903
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,526
You've been sleeping
with your consultant.

904
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,931
That's none of your business.

905
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,401
Another disaster
waiting to happen.

906
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:42,802
What does it matter
to you anyway?

907
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,326
It's difficult to stop
caring about someone

908
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:48,051
you've spent 25 years
of your life with.

909
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,400
But you did.

910
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,529
I apologize.

911
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,128
I'm willing to admit that...

912
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:04,886
I've been wrong.
And I'm sorry.

913
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,729
What are you talking about?

914
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,890
I don't want to sign.

915
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:21,403
If you fall on one issue,

916
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,839
you make that sacrifice,

917
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,684
we can accomplish
everything we've worked for.

918
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,881
You won't be able
to make this on your own terms.

919
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,999
Not this time.

920
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,287
500,000.

921
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:37,603
That's how many people
have filed with the GCCF.

922
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,523
I'd be responsible
for all of them.

923
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,331
It won't change a thing,
and you know it.

924
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,765
Why are you doing this?

925
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,086
I love you.

926
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,640
Whether you take
the deal or not.

927
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,201
Do me a favor.

928
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,806
Don't come back here
after the surgery.

929
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,881
<i>You've reached Kate Haber,</i>
you can leave me a message...

930
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,930
<i>City and state, please.</i>

931
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,765
Arlington, Virginia.
Katherine Haber.

932
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,239
Hello?

933
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,651
<i>Kate.</i>

934
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,608
Why are you
calling me at home?

935
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,047
Can we talk for a minute?

936
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,329
This isn't a good time.

937
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,051
Just call the office tomorrow
and we can talk then.

938
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,159
I miss you.

939
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:28,640
Honey, we're starting
the movie.

940
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,520
Can...
I just need a minute.

941
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,966
I'll just be a minute.

942
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,446
That was your husband.

943
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,931
We've decided to try
and work things out.

944
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,924
Were you going
to bother telling me?

945
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,651
<i>Yes, of course I was.</i>

946
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,042
But it just happened and...

947
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,571
I...

948
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,250
I don't know.

949
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,250
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

950
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,926
But what did you think
was going to happen?

951
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:12,808
<i>That I'd campaign with you?</i>

952
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,927
That I'd stand up there
on that podium by your side?

953
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:23,801
You weren't giving up politics
to be with me.

954
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:26,360
And if you did,
you would have been miserable.

955
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,206
<i>You would have resented me.</i>

956
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:34,001
<i>Maybe not at first,</i>
but what about in six months?

957
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,570
<i>OF a year?</i>

958
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,442
Do you love him?

959
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,731
<i>Oh, Colin,</i>
tell me that I'm wrong.

960
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,727
Tell me that I'm wrong.

961
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:10,567
I'm sorry to have
called so late.

962
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,649
You have a good night.

963
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,642
<i>Colin?</i>

964
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:08,087
<i>Colin, open the door.</i>

965
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:15,085
<i>Colin. Colin.</i>

966
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,924
<i>Open the door.</i>

967
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,410
<i>Unlock the door.</i>

968
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,928
<i>Colin.</i>

969
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,804
<i>You've always</i>
been a decent man, Colin.

970
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:55,646
<i>But that's</i>
not why I married you.

971
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:59,805
<i>I married you because I knew</i>
you had it in you to be a great man.

972
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,602
<i>And great men,</i>

973
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:10,006
<i>men who build legacies,</i>
they aren't always decent.

974
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,924
<i>They understand that people...</i>

975
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,890
<i>they need someone</i>
to tell them what to remember.

976
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,361
<i>And what to forget.</i>

977
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:24,123
<i>They need great men</i>
to insulate them from frailty.

978
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:28,683
<i>What's good, what's bad.</i>

979
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:35,928
<i>Because only great men know how to make</i>
people 's powerlessness tolerable.

980
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,771
<i>My mother grew up a couple</i>
miles east of here in Metairie.

981
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,763
<i>My father grew up in the city.</i>

982
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,650
<i>I was raised in Broadmoor.</i>
Graduated Jesuit High.

983
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:27,282
My parents had friends
who worked at this plant.

984
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,408
I had friends whose parents
worked at this plant.

985
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,721
And I have friends now
who work at this plant,

986
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,962
some of you are here today.

987
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:37,681
Sol understand
the problems that we face.

988
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,411
I understand our frustrations.

989
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,443
<i>And I am here</i>
to be the solution.

990
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:48,325
We must not let ourselves forget
the 11 men who died

991
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,289
on that Transocean rig

992
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,728
<i>or the impact the spill</i>
has had on the Gulf Coast.

993
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:58,601
But we also can't allow tragedy
to force us into making foolish decisions.

994
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,763
Instead of wasting our energy
vilifying the oil industry

995
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,605
and the GCCF,
we need to be patient.

996
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,286
We need to work together.

997
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,569
Because the fact
of the matter is,

998
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,085
we need each other.

999
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:42,407
Good legislating
is the art of compromise.

1000
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,131
Good business
is the art of compromise.

1001
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:58,410
Life will forever be
the art of compromise.

1002
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,962
Chris Wilcox doesn't understand
that around here people go

1003
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:06,728
from seafood to oil field
and from oil field to seafood.

1004
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,883
He doesn't understand that
a permanent ban on drilling

1005
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,042
will devastate
our local economy.

1006
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,329
He doesn't understand that
you cannot afford to send

1007
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:18,051
hard-earned American dollars
to the Middle East.

1008
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:31,170
I am running for Senate
to move things forward,

1009
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:34,323
not only for this
great state of Louisiana,

1010
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:37,165
but for this great country.
