1
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,109
You know that orange juice
you have every morning?

2
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,402
You know what's in that?

3
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,862
Corn.

4
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,698
And you know what's in the maple syrup
on your pancakes?

5
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,700
You know what makes it taste so good?

6
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,244
Corn. When you're good
and help with the trash...

7
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,497
...you know what makes the big,
green bags biodegradable?

8
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,790
Do you?

9
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,584
Corn.

10
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,460
Corn starch.

11
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,422
But Daddy's company didn't come up
with that one. DuPont did.

12
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,972
Porsche or Porsche?
I've heard it both ways.

13
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,142
Three years in Germany, I should know.
What's German for "corn"?

14
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,312
The German word I really like is
kugelschreiber. That's "pen."

15
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,606
All those syllables just for "pen."

16
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,988
Archer Daniels Midland.
Most people have never heard of us.

17
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,741
Chances are, they've never
had a meal we're not part of.

18
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,534
Just read the side of the package.

19
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,954
That's us. Now ADM
is taking the dextrose from the corn...

20
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:29,875
...and turning it into an amino acid
called lysine. It's all very scientific.

21
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,251
If you're a stockholder...

22
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,880
...all that matters is corn goes in one end
and profit comes out the other.

23
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,300
We have the largest lysine plant
in the world. That's where I come in.

24
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,927
- Hey, Kirk.
- Mark.

25
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,596
- When are we gonna hit some balls?
- Anytime.

26
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,891
What do they pay Kirk?
What does a guy like that get?

27
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,768
I bet he gets a hundred grand.

28
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:51,146
He's just gonna sit behind that desk
and ride it into the future.

29
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,898
Good morgen.

30
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,950
- Morning, Mark.
- Morning.

31
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,826
They have lysine results.

32
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,803
Great.

33
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,433
We adjusted the dextrose levels
again, but the virus keeps showing up.

34
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,854
I thought we had it surrounded this time.
We started a new set of cultures.

35
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,900
We'll get it.
We just have to stay after it.

36
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,611
The things eat sugar
and that's what we're giving them.

37
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,656
A warm place filled with sugar.

38
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:48,870
The fucking thing is supposed to
produce 113,000 tons annually.

39
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,998
We're not gonna get anywhere
close to that.

40
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:54,710
We've got over $150 million in
costs over there, guys.

41
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,878
Do the Japanese have these problems?

42
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,423
I don't give a shit about the Japanese.

43
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,550
You've gotta get
the goddamn lysine bugs...

44
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,386
...to eat some dextrose
and shit us out some money.

45
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,221
We're having problems with this virus.

46
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,223
I don't want to hear about the virus.

47
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,225
How much are we losing a month?

48
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:15,605
We are down like seven million per.

49
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,066
That's not gonna fly much longer.

50
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:22,404
You want to go in next month, tell my
father we're sucking the hind tit on this?

51
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,905
I sure don't.

52
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:27,993
We're number 44 on the Fortune 500 list,
Mark.

53
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,747
I don't want this turning us
into number 45.

54
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,248
Fix it.

55
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,754
Feed a chicken corn and it gets sick,
like what happened to the first settlers.

56
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,173
Pellagra disease. Niacin deficiency.

57
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,634
Gave them all sorts of problems:
dermatitis, ataxia, even dementia.

58
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:48,263
Feed a chicken corn and lysine and
it goes from egg to supermarket fryer...

59
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,349
...in six months instead of eight.

60
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,225
Mark?

61
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,187
Where are you?

62
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,440
Hey, you look great.

63
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,067
Oh.

64
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,571
They got the first wall of the stables
up today. See that?

65
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,115
You know they're doing a new thing
in hydroponics?

66
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,786
They're now feeding lysine
to the jumbo shrimp.

67
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,412
Can you imagine that?

68
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,540
You're a jumbo shrimp
and one day some corn goes floating by.

69
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,918
What do you think about that?

70
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,211
Weird, right?

71
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,296
There's an opening
in the plant in Mexico.

72
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,965
They might need me to go down
and set some stuff up.

73
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,801
What do you think about Mexico?

74
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,595
I thought we were getting horses.

75
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,140
Toro.

76
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,226
That's what Spanish bullfighters say.

77
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,270
But it's also what the Japanese call
the high-end tuna sushi.

78
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,648
Toro. Raw fish.

79
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,651
Who went first on that one?
The guy without the grill.

80
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,278
I've been to Tokio.
They sell little-girl underwear...

81
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:49,241
...in the vending machines right
on the main drag, the Ginza, or whatever.

82
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:54,413
Guys in suits buying used girl panties.
How is that okay? That's not okay.

83
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:56,998
Yeah.

84
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,419
There's a Mr. Nakawara calling
from the Ajinomoto Corporation.

85
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,839
He says you know him
and he needs to speak with you.

86
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,048
Yeah, put him through.

87
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:09,386
It's the Japanese. There's this guy,
Nakawara. He works at Ajinomoto.

88
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,555
He was here a couple weeks ago.
You met him.

89
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,516
I've been talking to him at work,
but sometimes from home...

90
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,643
...because of the time difference.

91
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:21,356
Mick, this guy knew everything.
Everything.

92
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:25,444
He says to me, "Hey, you know that total
nightmare you guys had May, June, July?"

93
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,988
Before I ask him what he's talking about,
he goes:

94
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:33,660
"Those months when ADM was losing
$7 million a month in the lysine business."

95
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,203
Mick, I couldn't believe it.

96
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,623
He goes on to tell me
that one of our highest-paid employees...

97
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:43,879
...is actually an employee of Ajinomoto,
who is sabotaging the plant.

98
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:48,675
They're injecting a virus into the dextrose
and contaminating the whole deal.

99
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,385
That's the problem.

100
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,888
I'm telling you, Mick, it's like Rising Sun.

101
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,557
It's like the Crichton novel.
It's just like that.

102
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,185
I go, "Why are you talking to me?"
Know what he says?

103
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,061
Yeah, I know what he says.

104
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,898
How much does he want?

105
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,150
Ten million dollars.

106
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:10,739
Ten million, but that gives you
the identity of the saboteur...

107
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,409
...the secret identity, and a new lysine bug
that is immune to the virus.

108
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,329
We have the plant up and running
in three days.

109
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,289
How well do you know this guy?

110
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:25,212
I met him when he was here. We've
spoken on the phone half a dozen times.

111
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,755
So not very well.

112
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:31,176
Very well? No, I wouldn't say that.

113
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,971
If you hear from him again,
talk him down on the price.

114
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,599
Find out the least amount of money
he'd settle for.

115
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:43,396
I mean, if we can get a bug that's resistant
to the virus, this might be worth it.

116
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,773
But keep this secret.

117
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:48,193
If there is a mole, I don't want him to know
that we're on to him.

118
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,528
Absolutely.

119
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,617
This would be a great Place
for some outlet stores.

120
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,954
People would come from all over
southern Illinois, probably Missouri.

121
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,039
Famous name-brand labels
and appliances...

122
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,833
...at savings
of up to 50 percent every day.

123
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,795
Maybe a food court
with a Mexican place.

124
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:11,550
The birds eat the bugs, the cars eat
the birds, the rust eats the cars...

125
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,469
- ...and new construction eats the rust.
Corky!

126
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,639
Alexander says there's a bat
in his room.

127
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,396
The FBI?

128
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,608
God, no.

129
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,904
I thought you wanted me to talk him down
on the price. And I was doing it.

130
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,949
We're not gonna sit back
and let the Japanese fuck us sideways.

131
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,828
I don't understand. We weren't gonna
mention it and now he's in on it?

132
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,081
Of course he's in on it.
If there's a mole, it's a security issue.

133
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,749
I'll be sitting in with the FBI.

134
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,003
I already told you everything there is
to tell.

135
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,754
I mean, what is the point?

136
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,756
Mark. Calm down. All right?

137
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,010
We don't like the idea of talking to the FBI
any more than you do.

138
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:59,681
They're just gonna tape the guy's calls,
ask you a few questions. No big deal.

139
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,058
Questions?

140
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,520
Jesus.

141
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,856
Mark?

142
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,858
The FBI?

143
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,444
Why do you have to talk to the FBI?
It's their plant.

144
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,155
Just... Just let them talk to the FBI.

145
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,241
Babe, I am really uncomfortable
with this.

146
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,493
There are some things
that are going on here.

147
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,913
What does that mean, "things"?

148
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:28,710
It just...
It means that we have to be careful.

149
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:33,214
Well, whatever you do, Corky,
no matter what's going on...

150
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:36,551
...just be honest with them
and tell them the truth, okay?

151
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,680
He said he wanted the money wired...

152
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:46,728
...into a numbered account
in Switzerland...

153
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,147
...and then also in the Caribbean.

154
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:58,114
Uh... And when did you last have contact
with him?

155
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,033
Two days ago.

156
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,746
But I think he's getting suspicious.

157
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:10,669
I've been dragging this thing along.
I think if we don't make a move...

158
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,046
I mean, he could already
have backed down here.

159
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,592
And these calls, they've been coming in
on your home line?

160
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:24,766
Well, I have an ADM line at my house.
It's a business line.

161
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,937
They've been coming in
on the business line.

162
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,774
Well, I think we should start with...

163
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,069
...putting a recording device
on your phone.

164
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,737
There's a sale at Bachrach's.

165
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,657
They have those Oscar de la Renta ties
that nobody buys.

166
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,826
What are they,
two for one for another week?

167
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,121
Diagonal bands of color hanging
around your neck.

168
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,456
They never put the nice Brioni ties
on sale.

169
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,500
I should just get all my ties in Paris...

170
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,461
...wear them once or twice
and shove them in a duty-free bag.

171
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,755
Nobody gets stopped at customs
for ties.

172
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,716
I can help with that.

173
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,344
So...

174
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,179
...that's it, then.

175
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,515
I can go?

176
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,519
Listen. Why don't...? Ahem.

177
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,149
I'd like to come out tomorrow,
get on that phone.

178
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,152
Great. No problem.

179
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,030
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you.

180
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:48,600
You told the truth, Mark.
That's all you can do.

181
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,518
I never even had the chance.

182
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,982
They were watching me the whole time.

183
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,820
Cheviron was in the room.

184
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:14,709
Mick Andreas gets the vice president
of the United States as his godfather.

185
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,170
He goes to Richard Nixon's house
for Thanksgiving.

186
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,881
It's not like his parents died
in a car accident...

187
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,050
...and he ended up in an orphanage.

188
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,427
Mick's dad wrote a check
to the Nixon campaign.

189
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,055
It wound up in the account
of the Watergate burglars.

190
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,224
Did he admit it? I don't think so.

191
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,684
Besides, ADM probably owns the FBI.

192
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,562
They probably wanted me
to move into Dwayne's old house...

193
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,816
...because they got it wired
like in a Crichton novel.

194
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,901
Marty Allison called.

195
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:44,739
And Sid Hulse wants to know if you can
have dinner at 7:00 instead of 7:30.

196
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,750
Great earrings, Ginger.

197
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,419
Bet you can see those shining
from space.

198
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,756
Mark got them abroad.

199
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,383
I can't remember where.

200
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,093
Nigeria?

201
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,053
Not funny, Sid.

202
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,429
You're telling me.

203
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,517
So, Sid, you're off tomorrow?

204
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,936
Where to?

205
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,896
West Coast swing.

206
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,024
Gotta get up there.
Kick some Japanese butt.

207
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,653
I'm not gonna see you for weeks?

208
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,364
Maybe longer if I get lost in the Ginza.

209
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,742
Have a great trip, Sid.

210
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,039
Just tell them everything.

211
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,375
We'll leave.

212
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,087
I don't like what this company
is doing to you.

213
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,591
This is a chance
to start somewhere new.

214
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,051
Remember, you said Mexico?

215
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:53,224
I may tell them at some point. But now,
I gotta toe the company line here.

216
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,226
Mark...

217
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,229
...if you don't tell them, I will.

218
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,566
I can't.

219
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,027
Not now.

220
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,163
Hello. Please.

221
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,958
Agent Shepard, my wife, Ginger.

222
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,170
Ma'am. I know it's late.

223
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,213
I'll be out of your hair in a minute.

224
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,592
Great. Maybe a cup of coffee
for Agent Shepard?

225
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,510
Okay.

226
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,556
Just show me where the line
in question...

227
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,933
It's that one over there.

228
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,186
There should be a TV show about
a guy who calls home and he's there.

229
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,356
He answers, he's talking to himself,
only it's someone else.

230
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,859
He's somehow divided into two
and the second one of him drives away.

231
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,487
The show is about him trying
to find the guy.

232
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,573
I'll give you a call tomorrow.
We can test it out.

233
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,242
Great. Great. Okay.
Thank you for coming by.

234
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,452
- Good night.
- Night.

235
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,204
Good night, Mrs. Whitacre.

236
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,664
Good night.

237
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,380
- Are you gonna say something, or am I?
- Don't.

238
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,093
Brian?

239
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,179
Hey, got a minute?

240
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,935
Um...

241
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,399
Can I talk to you in the car?

242
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,193
Sure.

243
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,710
We could go back inside if you want.

244
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,671
They might have it bugged.
We're safer out here.

245
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,172
Bugged?

246
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,341
What?

247
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,593
Who?

248
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,346
Us?

249
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,142
All right, there's things I know.
If I decide to tell you...

250
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,601
...could I be prosecuted?

251
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,646
I cannot provide you with immunity,
but any information...

252
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,357
...about your involvement
in criminal activity...

253
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,570
...would be discussed in a favorable light
with the U.S. Attorney's office.

254
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:17,827
Okay. Everything I told you yesterday
about Nakawara was true. Absolutely.

255
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,415
Except one thing. He never called me
on my business line.

256
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,460
Well, why did you tell me that he did?

257
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:29,547
Before I spoke with you yesterday,
I was coached by the guys at ADM...

258
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,842
...to tell you that he called
on my business line, not my home line.

259
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,052
Why?

260
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:40,141
What I'm about to tell you,
it involves something very large.

261
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,645
This Nakawara extortion thing is nothing
compared to it, nothing at all.

262
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,985
This involves price fixing
in the lysine business.

263
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,738
- Now...
- Wait, hang on.

264
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,120
Take some notes.

265
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,667
- Okay, go on.
- Price fixing in the lysine business.

266
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:11,172
I have been in several meetings with
our Japanese and Korean competitors...

267
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,176
...over the last few months, where
the sole purpose was to fix the prices.

268
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,720
ADM made me go to those meetings.

269
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,680
See, that's why they wanted me to lie.

270
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,391
Because the Nakawara calls came in
on my home line...

271
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,520
...but so do the calls from the people
we're fixing prices with.

272
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,355
They don't want you to hear those.

273
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,900
They instructed me to tell you the
Nakawara calls came in on my ADM line.

274
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,570
But I realized that once you guys started
digging around in the records...

275
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,115
...you'd see I have all these calls
to Japan.

276
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,284
Right? That's what scared me.
Nobody's got more calls than me.

277
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:44,038
So if you figure out the price-fixing thing,
I'd be the fall guy.

278
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,250
Who told you to participate
in these price-fixing talks?

279
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,758
I'm operating under the direction of
Mick and Dwayne Andreas.

280
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,642
He seems like a real good guy.

281
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,187
I hope he doesn't mind me calling
him Brian instead of Agent Shepard.

282
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,772
I might even try Bri out.

283
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,066
This must be very different for him...

284
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,486
...talking to a guy like me instead
of a bank robber or a drug dealer.

285
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,073
I could see us fishing or whatever.

286
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:23,369
What a good listener.
You don't meet one of those every day.

287
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:48,728
Morning.

288
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,479
What happened last night?

289
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,940
What do you mean? Nothing.
Well, they put a...

290
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,110
...recorder on the phone.

291
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,821
That's it?

292
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,531
Well, yeah.

293
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,284
He said when Nakawara calls...

294
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,747
...I just flip a switch
and record the conversation.

295
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,084
Yeah?

296
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,420
- Oh. Put her through.
- Make sure you do it.

297
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,297
They have ways of checking up.

298
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,090
Sure thing.

299
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,718
Hi, hon.

300
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,136
What?

301
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,139
Slow down, honey, slow...

302
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:35,107
What?

303
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:40,154
A pound of bacon, a peanut
butter sandwich, some vitamins.

304
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,495
Anything that ADM has a hand in,
it's all fixed. That's what he's telling me.

305
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,664
I mean, basically...

306
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:53,000
I mean, everyone in this country is a victim
of corporate crime...

307
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,336
...by the time they finish breakfast.

308
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,631
You think the automobile
companies can't make a car...

309
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,508
...that gets 100 miles to the gallon?

310
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,386
You think the networks
don't know who'll win the World Series...

311
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,679
...before the season starts?

312
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,515
Paranoid is what people who are trying
to take advantage...

313
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,101
...call you to get you to drop your guard.

314
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,186
I read that in an in-flight magazine.

315
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:17,692
One potential problem I see moving ahead
with ADM is this guy Cheviron.

316
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:22,029
He wants to be kept in on the loop
on everything that we're doing.

317
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,537
I want to meet Mark Whitacre.

318
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:35,167
You said they were only
gonna tap one line. One line.

319
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,379
- They are only monitoring one line.
- That is not true.

320
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:42,049
That is absolutely not true.
I just got off the phone with my wife.

321
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,885
Some woman named Regina
at the phone company called her...

322
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:48,264
...and said that both my lines are tapped.
My home phone.

323
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,350
Come on, Mark. The phone company
doesn't call people and say:

324
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:55,896
"Hello, we just wanted to let you know
that the FBI is tapping your phone lines."

325
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,232
Then why would Regina say that?

326
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,736
She didn't say it. You're saying it.

327
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,571
Call my wife.

328
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,907
- Call Regina.
- Fine. Mark.

329
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,369
I will. All right? I will.

330
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,204
Good.

331
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,420
I don't like wool on skin.

332
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,882
Not even that merino wool they have
at Marshall Field in Chicago.

333
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,093
Ginger likes it because it's formfitting,
but she likes avocados.

334
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,429
And who wants that texture
in their mouth?

335
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:32,600
Who'd make up someone named Regina?
It's the capital of Saskatchewan.

336
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,525
FBI, Shepard.

337
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,028
Hello, Brian. It's Mark Cheviron at ADM.

338
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,529
Yeah, Mark.

339
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:49,283
I was talking to you guys a couple
days ago about which of the lines...

340
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,911
...at Mark Whitacre's house
you would be monitoring...

341
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,164
...and we had agreed
it would only be the business line...

342
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,917
...so that's all you did, right?

343
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,045
I really can't answer that.

344
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,131
Uh... Okay.

345
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,841
Thank you.

346
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:22,024
We have decided we will no longer be
cooperating with any further FBI requests.

347
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,110
I knew it. I knew it.

348
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:28,280
I told you and you wouldn't listen.
You said, "Just the office line, Mark."

349
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,283
Evidently, they were lying to us too.

350
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:35,079
Well, evidently, you can't keep track
of what the FBI's doing.

351
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:38,916
Yeah?

352
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,168
The call you were expecting, Mark?

353
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,962
Well, put him through.

354
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,381
It's a Swedish deal I'm working on.

355
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,510
- Mark Whitacre.
- Hey, Mark, it's Brian Shepard.

356
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,846
I told Shepard we're done working
with him now.

357
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,432
Hi. So good to hear from you.

358
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,227
I want to bring my supervisor by
to meet you.

359
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,146
This weekend be okay?

360
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,189
Well, great.

361
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:05,526
Well... So Mr. Andreas is in my office
right now.

362
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,279
Okay.
- So I'll talk to you later.

363
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,738
- Okay.
- Good.

364
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,866
What do I do if this Shepard guy calls?

365
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,660
You let me know about it,
and I'll tell my dad.

366
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,371
But you're done talking to them.

367
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,166
Absolutely.

368
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,380
Okay, guys, I'm gonna go over the rules.

369
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:30,301
There's no running, no pushing,
no horseplay by the pool.

370
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,887
And when you have fished
all the leaves out...

371
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:36,765
...you go into the garage and get the cover
for the pool.

372
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,352
And I'm gonna go get your dad
when he's done...

373
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,730
...and he's gonna come
and do an inspection.

374
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,191
- What was that, honey?
You already told us this.

375
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:49,153
Honey, well, I'm going over it again.

376
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,366
Now, what is the scoop with all my phones
being tapped?

377
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,578
The only listening device
was the recorder, Mark.

378
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:03,083
We had a trap-and-trace device on your
home line, but we can't listen in on that.

379
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,212
However,
the phone company calling your wife...

380
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,589
...and telling her
about our intel gathering...

381
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,925
Well, my face is red on that one.

382
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,635
Shouldn't happen.

383
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,847
- Did you bring the expense reports?
- Yeah. Yeah.

384
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:22,061
Okay, this is Mexico City, Paris,
Hong Kong, Tokio.

385
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,773
There was a meeting of the Corn Refiners
Association in Florida last week.

386
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,441
Mick and Terry went to that one.

387
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,819
They were doing the regular meeting
during the day, and at night...

388
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:34,698
...they'd get together with our competitors
and work out how to fix the prices.

389
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,910
Watch. In about six months,
the price of a liter of soda pop...

390
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,954
...is gonna be about 5 cents more.

391
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,747
Well, when's the next meeting?

392
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:45,125
January. Somewhere in Asia.

393
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:49,129
Mark, I gotta ask you.
Why are you doing this?

394
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,758
We know you lied about the phone line,
and you're afraid of that.

395
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:58,138
But now you're telling us all this other stuff
out of the blue. Got to ask you why.

396
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,351
Well, because things are going on
I don't approve of.

397
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,854
Now, I'm a biochemist.
I'm a technical guy.

398
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,982
And they pull me
into the business side...

399
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:11,819
...and suddenly I find out all these things
are going on that are illegal.

400
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,155
If I want to grow with ADM,
I gotta learn the business side.

401
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:18,117
And so suddenly, I'm lying.
They're making me lie to people.

402
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,577
I lie to you.

403
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,453
I mean, I feel real bad about that.

404
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:25,583
You look at yourself as wearing a white
hat and they're wearing black hats?

405
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,501
Absolutely. Something like that.

406
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,713
When I was a kid,
my folks died in an automobile accident.

407
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,842
I was maybe 6 years old and a
wealthy man from Ohio adopted me.

408
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:38,053
Guy owned amusement parks.
He did very well for himself.

409
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:42,683
I caught a big break there, real big break.
I went to a good school and all.

410
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:47,271
Now I adopted two kids of my own.
I'm trying to do the right thing here.

411
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,940
Well, Mark...

412
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,652
...do you think you'd be wiling
to go a few steps further in helping us?

413
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,572
What does that mean?

414
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,407
Would you...

415
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,868
...be willing to wear a wire?

416
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:04,747
We don't have any other sources
at this time. We...

417
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,582
We need your help.

418
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:10,711
We'll be there with you
all the way. It won't be easy.

419
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:14,173
I'll use my beeper to signal you
when it's time to set up a meeting.

420
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,674
When you hear this...

421
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,217
You know. Right?

422
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,095
...you call me.

423
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,350
He's watched closely at work...

424
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:28,228
...and there's reason to believe
that ADM has bugged his home.

425
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:33,192
He's under a great deal of pressure.
I mean, you gotta feel for the guy.

426
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,736
He tells us the truth one day...

427
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,406
...and wakes up the next with two lives
instead of one.

428
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:43,410
Well, the good news is he decided
to wake up and tell the truth.

429
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,165
There are these butterflies
in Central America.

430
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,418
They're blue and orange and yellow
and have poison in their wings.

431
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,712
Just enough poison to stop a bird heart.

432
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,840
But the birds know this somehow,
so they don't eat them.

433
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,635
But there are other ones, butterflies...

434
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:03,764
...they're orange, blue and yellow too,
but no poison wings.

435
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:07,434
They're just flying around, looking
dangerous, getting by on their looks.

436
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,144
Hey, Mark.

437
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,939
- Hi, Brian.
- Ready to make the call?

438
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:22,282
Hey, wait up, dipshit.
- We're gonna do it here?

439
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:29,623
We can't get a room.
There's problems with that.

440
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,085
Um...

441
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,881
I don't know, it just kind of seems,
you know, awkward.

442
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,300
It's the best I can do right now.

443
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,971
Okay.

444
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,098
Just...

445
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,103
Hold the microphone against
the receiver and I'll hold the recorder.

446
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,312
009...

447
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,816
...454...

448
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,986
...58822.

449
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,404
Thank you.

450
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:06,160
- No, no, put it on the receiver.
- Mr. Yamamoto, please.

451
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,036
The receiver.

452
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,665
- I have it on the receiver.
- On the receiver, where you hear.

453
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,420
I'm on hold.

454
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:23,010
Hello, Mr. Yamamoto.
It is Mark Whitacre.

455
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,554
Hi, sir. How are you?

456
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,309
No, I'm doing a lot of traveling this week,
a lot of traveling.

457
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,603
How are sales?

458
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:36,815
Certainly we need to, in terms of our...

459
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,442
In terms of our big customers...

460
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,862
...we definitely need to be thinking
about a good price, yes?

461
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,365
It's better to maintain a price
of $2.50 in other countries...

462
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:50,037
...and $1.05 for the United States,
and just like that, there it is: price fixing.

463
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,874
Well, this is great, Mark.
This verifies everything you've been saying.

464
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,417
Yeah.

465
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,212
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

466
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,883
I like an indoor pool. Year-round usage.

467
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:06,720
I like the steam off it in the winter.
Very mysterious, that steam.

468
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,388
Well, Marty...

469
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,935
...when you started work at ADM,
how much money did you want?

470
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,520
I wanted 50 grand.

471
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:19,817
But I went and told Terry,
"We can't get this guy for less than 75."

472
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,444
- Yeah.
- I got it for you. You were the first I hired.

473
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,739
You've always been really generous
with me. And I appreciate it.

474
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,950
Here's what I want you to do.

475
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,869
I want you to write down a name.

476
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,916
Okay. What's the name?

477
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,753
Nordkron Chemie.

478
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:44,967
What is that, like,
a Nigerian name or something?

479
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:48,470
I like my hands. I think they're probably
my favorite part of my body.

480
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:51,515
I think that can be used to my advantage
in social situations.

481
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,269
If I can get people focused on my hands,
I can get a good result in a meeting.

482
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,104
Eye contact is real important too.

483
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,439
Hey, I'm gonna check messages.

484
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,742
You have one message.

485
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,748
My phone died. I was on with the plant.

486
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,084
Is there a payphone,
a public but kind of...?

487
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,419
- Across the lobby.
- Right.

488
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,338
- Mark, this is important bioproduct stuff.
- I know.

489
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,965
Hi, Dave. How's Holly doing?

490
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,300
She's good.
- Great.

491
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,676
It's the plant.

492
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,345
FBI.
- Brian, it's Mark.

493
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,181
I told you, I'm out of town
on business this week.

494
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,726
The case is getting some attention
from the Bureau.

495
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,644
There's another agent working
with me.

496
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,688
I can't talk right now.
I have a meeting.

497
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,149
I have people waiting for me. Bye.

498
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,985
I'm here, Dave.

499
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:49,031
Being able to do two things at once
is a big part of success.

500
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,575
I try and do abdominal exercises...
Isometrics.

501
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,243
...even when I'm at a meeting.

502
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,287
Tensing. Holding.

503
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,538
Then releasing.

504
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,708
I'll floss in the shower
while the conditioner is in my hair...

505
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,877
...when you're just supposed
to leave it in.

506
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,130
Those things can really add up
to a significant time savings.

507
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,715
Hey, Kirk.

508
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,634
I'll be heading to Europe...

509
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:12,638
...and I thought I could just hand deliver
that check for the ABP deal in person.

510
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,348
Remind me. ABP deal?

511
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,684
It's a threonine microbe.
They're making substantial improvements.

512
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,187
We want to get into the market.
That's the invoice.

513
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,480
We'll just overnight it.

514
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,816
I'm gonna see this Thorstensson guy,
so I'll just hand it to him.

515
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,573
The metric system never panned out.
We had rulers...

516
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,201
...with inches on one edge,
centimeters on the other.

517
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:38,038
I pronounced it "centimeters" instead of
"centimeters" and nobody corrected me.

518
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,416
They let me walk around stupid.
I'm not upset we never crossed over...

519
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,794
...though it's helpful
to know the conversions.

520
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,171
The liter bottle is the thing
that caught on...

521
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,383
...because it's a nicer word,
"liter" than "quart."

522
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,260
Quart.

523
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,680
Mark, it's Marty calling again.

524
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,225
Message deleted.

525
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,697
FBI, Agent Shepard.

526
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,615
Brian, it's Mark.

527
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,243
Look, it's been hard for me
to return a page...

528
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,829
...as I am out of the country
at the moment.

529
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,749
Listen, we need to know if you've had
any further contact with Nakawara.

530
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:26,086
I told you already
that the guy stopped calling.

531
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:30,590
Well, what about the price fixing? Have
you been able to make any more tapes?

532
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,719
I think you guys hanging around
has everybody scared straight.

533
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,221
The word is we're doing everything
by the book now.

534
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,932
Mick said it's over. No more price fixing.

535
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,978
What? When did this happen,
this conversation?

536
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:48,066
Everything has changed. I got lysine
up and running. The virus is gone.

537
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:51,361
Mick brought me into his office,
he sat me down.

538
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,781
He said, "Whitacre, from now on
we're doing things your way."

539
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,616
Mark.

540
00:33:56,784 --> 00:34:00,287
Look, Mark,
the FBI knows about the crimes.

541
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,956
We're gonna investigate either way.

542
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,958
Either way?
What does "either way" mean?

543
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,044
We really need to get together.

544
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,630
It is a different approach there now.
I’m telling you, it's all...

545
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,091
Everything's changed.

546
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,762
My plane is boarding. I gotta go.
I gotta go.

547
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,972
Ah!

548
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,318
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, fine.

549
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,819
Kids.

550
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,409
- Where were we?
- We were discussing bonuses.

551
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,496
And we should be discussing Ferraris.

552
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,169
You have Full federhaltertinte
all over your shirt.

553
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,630
Ow.

554
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,799
One of the Japanese guys
told me a story.

555
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,801
This lysine salesman is in a meeting...

556
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,595
...with someone from ConAgra
or some other company.

557
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,139
And the client leans forward and says:

558
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:05,310
"I have the same tie as you,
only the pattern is reversed."

559
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,939
And then he drops dead,
face down on the table.

560
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,900
Alive and then dead.

561
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,360
Brain aneurysm.

562
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,656
Maybe everyone has a sentence like that,
a little time bomb.

563
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:21,576
"I have the same tie as you,
only the pattern's reversed."

564
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:25,789
Dead. The last thing they'll ever say.
Something like...

565
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,209
High-fructose corn syrup.
There it is again.

566
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:32,462
He said that Andreas called
him into a marketing meeting.

567
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,381
He might be late.

568
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,968
If he doesn't show, the government
ought to charge him for the room.

569
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,014
And here it comes.

570
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,728
Shepard.

571
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:52,399
I can't come to the hotel tonight.
I'm still at work.

572
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,151
Mark, this is the third time.

573
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,820
I gotta go. I have work to do.

574
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:01,658
- Mark, you can't keep canceling.
- Look, I can't live two lives.

575
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,412
They just offered me
a $100,000 raise, okay?

576
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,998
I'm not gonna lose my job
because of you guys.

577
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,917
I have a family.
I'm building stables across the road.

578
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:15,255
- But you told us...
- The price fixing is over. It's over.

579
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,633
Hey, Mick.
I'm getting off the phone now.

580
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,760
Mark, listen to me.

581
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:24,806
The only logical thing for you to do
is cooperate.

582
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,558
What happens if I don't?

583
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:30,854
Then somebody else will,
and you'll end up being a defendant.

584
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,691
The tapes don't say anything,
because it's over. Mick said.

585
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,443
We have a whole new policy.

586
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:41,990
Fine, if that's what he said. Then I want
to hear the tape. We need tapes, Mark.

587
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,619
Okay, I never made any tapes.

588
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:49,122
I never made any because there's not
gonna be anything on the tapes.

589
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,291
It's over, and they'd just be stupid tapes.

590
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,918
- Mark, come on.
- Look, how...?

591
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,795
You tell me how I can prove it to you,
and I Will.

592
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:42,259
Mick Andreas and his dad
would never lie for me.

593
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,761
They say we're in it together.
What a joke.

594
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,847
Team-building offsite meetings
at some lake in Wisconsin.

595
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,558
I can't protect these guys
if they're breaking the law.

596
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:53,436
Hey, I tried.
Anybody could see the choices I had.

597
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,231
I did my best for ADM.
You don't see them here in the chair.

598
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,694
Hey, how'd I do?

599
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,696
Mark, we have some problems.

600
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:07,409
Wait a minute. I was looking at the thing.
The needle didn't even move.

601
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,870
Mark, you don't know
how to read a polygraph.

602
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:13,707
Well, first of all,
they're not 100 percent accurate.

603
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,042
Mark, you splattered the walls with ink.

604
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:20,338
Come on. Extortionists just don't leave
their name and number, then go away.

605
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,881
I know it's tough...

606
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:25,802
...keeping it all bottled up inside,
keeping it a secret.

607
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:30,056
But there's only one good choice for you.
That's all there's ever been.

608
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,059
There's something
you're not telling us...

609
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:39,065
...but the only way to protect yourself
is to be completely honest.

610
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,533
Okay.

611
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,244
Okay.

612
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,750
You realize...

613
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,338
...that this can all be used against you
in a court of law.

614
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,591
I'll have to write it all up,
and you'll have to sign it.

615
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,926
We're going to find out what's going on,
Mark.

616
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,722
You're not leaving this room
until you tell us what's going on.

617
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,266
So before you answer
any more questions...

618
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,518
...I want you to think about Ginger...

619
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,104
...and your family, and your career.

620
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,443
What happened with Nakawara?

621
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,612
Is there a mole?

622
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:34,287
Well, yeah, I think there has definitely
been a mole, before, at ADM.

623
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,463
- I made it up.
- Jesus, Mark.

624
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,881
I had to.

625
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:48,259
Look, we've had problems with viruses
at the plant...

626
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,804
...and we're way behind our projections.

627
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:54,599
Dwayne is thinking about shutting us down
and everybody's looking to me.

628
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,811
It's all "Blame it on Whitacre."
That's how it is over there.

629
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,230
We're talking about my job here.

630
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:04,984
I came all the way over from Europe,
relocated my family. They made me a VP.

631
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:09,155
Uh... Uh... What about the price fixing?
It isn't over, is it?

632
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,157
I mean, there's no new attitude, right?

633
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:15,161
It's been going on as recently
as three weeks ago. Nothing's changed.

634
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:18,581
It's not just lysine.
It's citric, it's gluconate...

635
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,876
A guy left the company because
he wouldn't do it. He was forced out.

636
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,129
The gluconate guy, he's out of a job.

637
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:27,882
I met with the guys from Ajinomoto
just last month in Chicago.

638
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:32,345
The whole point
was to actually set volume levels.

639
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,390
You set the volume levels,
determine what the market is...

640
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:39,561
...and then you figure out workable prices.
We got another meeting next month.

641
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,773
If there's anything else you want to add,
now is the time.

642
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,900
What else is there?

643
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:59,539
Seven-thirty a.m., March 17th...

644
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,374
...1993.

645
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:06,880
I have parked the car. I am approaching
the entrance to the office.

646
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,383
Entrance breached.

647
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:15,054
Terrance Wilson.
President of our corn businesses.

648
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:18,475
Did our friend from Japan
call last night?

649
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,226
No, he wasn't in.

650
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:23,897
Well, I spoke with Mimoto
and he is pissed.

651
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,566
He says there will be no peace
in lysine...

652
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,819
...until we bring production down
to the levels we promised.

653
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:34,532
Well, in '92, we did exactly what we
told him we would do in terms of volume.

654
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,452
Exactly. Now, no promise.

655
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,078
He says he wants to talk to you.

656
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:44,542
Yeah? Well, I'll be right there saying,
"Listen here, you mousy motherfucker."

657
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:51,883
That was Terry Wilson talking
about setting volume...

658
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:55,762
...and price levels
with our Japanese competitor...

659
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,348
...Ajinomoto Corporation.

660
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,726
By the way, there was no discussion
with Mimoto last night.

661
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,354
I did that for illustration purposes only.

662
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,814
I repeat, no discussion with Mimoto.

663
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:10,902
Morning, Mark.
- Good morning, Liz Taylor, secretary.

664
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,790
- Please, come in.
- Hello. Good morning.

665
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:27,460
Good morning. Hello. Good morning.
Good morning.

666
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,421
Before we even deal
with Latin America...

667
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:34,467
...we have to agree
that we are gonna swap numbers.

668
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,427
It's the only way this is gonna work.

669
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:41,474
Keep everybody on target.
It's possible to do. Got to be very careful.

670
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,310
Need to check your phones.

671
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:49,816
Excuse me, I need a comfort break.
Pardon me.

672
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:03,663
Side two, tape one.

673
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,417
I've got well over two
million frequent flyer miles.

674
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,502
I'm pretty much platinum
across the board.

675
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,130
I get a letter from the CEO every year,
thanking me.

676
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,549
It's a form letter.
It looks like he's signing it.

677
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:18,261
They probably walk in and he signs
like a hundred while he's on the phone.

678
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,934
Oh, it went great. I think we're gonna
be able to keep it at a buck and a quarter.

679
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:32,150
Now what happens? Something you
breathe in on an airplane, some bacteria...

680
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,569
...and now it's in his hands, the cup,
the phone.

681
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,947
Probably got it from his kids
and now I'll spend the weekend with it.

682
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,492
I'll miss a few days or Alexander will
run a fever and who pays for that?

683
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,704
Where does the FBI weigh in on that
as a cooperating witness?

684
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,498
What does it say about exposure
to airborne contaminants?

685
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:51,628
Tape seven, side two. Chicago O'Hare.

686
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:55,381
Once again,
Terry Wilson representing ADM.

687
00:43:55,549 --> 00:44:00,720
Representing Euro lysine,
Alain Crouy and Philippe Rollier.

688
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,889
That's a French company.

689
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,899
That's a big break right there.
Absolutely.

690
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,401
There's no choices to be made,
no debate.

691
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,737
You're an ant, you just eat it.

692
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,614
...part of the world where it works...

693
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,075
...and the rest of the world
where it doesn't.

694
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,326
It will not last.

695
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,746
- Terry, Alain, Philippe.
- Hi.

696
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,749
We obviously would play the game.

697
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,919
- But the Koreans and the Japanese...
- They cheat.

698
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,088
Then it won't work.

699
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,841
Well, you make it work
in the other divisions. Tell them.

700
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,262
Terry doesn't like me very much.
He's got blotchy skin.

701
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,348
What causes that blotchiness?

702
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,016
It must mean something medical.

703
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:51,270
He'll have a stroke and someone will say,
"He was blotchy. It happens."

704
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:55,900
If prices went up in Europe,
it's because we talked in Mexico first.

705
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,362
That's right. You made it happen.

706
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,739
It was our pleasure.

707
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:06,119
Mark, these are just the kind of tapes
we need.

708
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:11,374
And we're getting our marching orders
from Andreas. See? Goes right to the top.

709
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,876
We need to improve the quality
of these recordings.

710
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,430
Hey, Rusty.

711
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,141
Take a look at something.

712
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,105
What do you think?

713
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,482
That's a nice briefcase.

714
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,151
But wait.

715
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,987
There's more.

716
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,033
That...

717
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,327
...is a Nagra SN.

718
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,664
Had the Bureau custom-make it for me.

719
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:56,002
Mark Whitacre, secret agent 0014.

720
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,838
Why 0014?

721
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,507
Because I'm twice as smart as 007.

722
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,471
Ah. Thank you again.

723
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,977
What happened to that girl
who worked for us?

724
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,730
Didn't she move to California?
What was her name? Tina?

725
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,441
Oh, Tina. Yeah, she's getting married.

726
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,860
Ugh. My Tina's getting married?

727
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,613
She's getting married
two or three weeks from now.

728
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,531
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

729
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,326
Well, that won't last long.
She's a bit of a dodo-head.

730
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,204
She'll be back.

731
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:35,208
I just hope she doesn't get pregnant
and fuck up that body.

732
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:38,377
She had a nice body. It'll ruin her tits.

733
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:43,007
When polar bears hunt, they crouch down
by a hole in the ice and wait for a seal.

734
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,219
They keep one paw over their nose
so that they blend in...

735
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,137
...because they've got black noses.

736
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,765
They'd blend in perfectly
if not for the nose.

737
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,811
So the question is, how do they know
their noses are black?

738
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,854
From looking at other polar bears?

739
00:46:57,022 --> 00:47:01,859
Do they see their reflections in the water,
and think, "I'd be invisible if not for that."

740
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,195
That seems like a lot of thinking
for a bear.

741
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:10,159
Remember to pat them down
for wires before the meeting.

742
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,577
What?
New policy.

743
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,538
Whenever we meet with the Japanese.

744
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:16,541
You're kidding, right?
I didn't get a memo.

745
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,836
- I didn't get any kind of memo on that.
- He's kidding. Relax, Mark.

746
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,380
They don't have the balls
to mess with ADM.

747
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,591
When it's over, the board of directors
at ADM is gonna understand.

748
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:29,345
They're gonna see the position I was in.
I acted in everyone's best interest.

749
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,514
That's the only conclusion
they can reach.

750
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,933
I'm the youngest division president
they've had.

751
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,853
I speak a number of languages fluently.

752
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:52,201
Would you like some coffee or fruits?

753
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,539
No.

754
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,583
No.

755
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,418
Mark, no.

756
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,796
- No.
- I told him the camera was in the lamp.

757
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:11,971
We already spend more than one year
to get better market situation in lysine.

758
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,140
We talked a little bit about it
in Paris...

759
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:18,227
...but we need to come
to an understanding on volume.

760
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,813
- We have public shareholders.
- Can you...?

761
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,648
You need to widen out a little.

762
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,109
We need to show them working
together.

763
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,445
Now the question is:

764
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,698
If the market grows, who gets it?

765
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:37,747
If Kyowa Hakko, Miwon and
Cheil Corporation each get 2000 tons...

766
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,498
...we can divide up the rest.

767
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,793
If we're gonna have any stability at all.

768
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,839
We need...
We need some specific number.

769
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:50,635
Well, what would you be willing to accept?
Isn't that really the question?

770
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,679
ADM has already eaten all the growth.

771
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:56,182
We have a lot more
capacity that we're not using.

772
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:00,144
We could be growing 20,000 tons.
Isn't that right, Mark?

773
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,897
I'm going in. We gotta shut this down.

774
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,231
No, wait. Hold on.

775
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,317
- I need your input.
I think he's got it.

776
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:10,029
ADM will be allocated its recent
production, plus...

777
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,447
They talk about Paris.

778
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,157
I can't understand.
The meeting.

779
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,867
We have a big board of directors.

780
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:18,245
They have a big board
of directors. And shareholders.

781
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:21,332
And they're all suffering together.

782
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,628
Well, where's the agreement?
I mean, this is just a discussion.

783
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,339
If there isn't an agreement,
what are they doing there?

784
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:32,718
You're getting bogged down
with the words. Just look at the actions.

785
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:36,806
Look what happens right here. Okay?

786
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,057
See what he's doing?

787
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:42,019
Yeah, I've looked and I just see
a chart with a bunch of words.

788
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:46,232
I don't even see any numbers on that.
I mean, I can't pinpoint an agreement.

789
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,776
What more do you want?
The guy is standing there...

790
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,028
...dividing up the market, plain as day.

791
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,905
It could just be a proposal.

792
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:56,826
All the other companies weren't there.
No one used the word "agreement."

793
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:01,497
I'm telling you. From the perspective of
the Justice Department, it is not enough.

794
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:05,251
We're having another meeting
to work out some of the issues in lysine.

795
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:08,921
We have to divide up the volumes
and set prices for some of the markets.

796
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,715
Europe again?

797
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,174
Europe is out.

798
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:16,762
There is a price-fixing investigation in
the cement manufacturing business there.

799
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,390
It's got everybody spooked,
so we're not going there.

800
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,018
We can't videotape in Japan.
That's not gonna help us.

801
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,686
Hawaii.

802
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:27,523
- Hawaii?
- Hawaii.

803
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,742
Oh!

804
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,484
Okay. So everybody just...

805
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:14,487
Goddamn it, Mark.
Look at the size of this. That's bullshit.

806
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:15,654
Yeah.

807
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,406
Can you call and get us a bigger room?

808
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:21,160
This is the only room they have.
- Will you call them, please?

809
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,955
I will. I will. Make yourselves at home,
please. I'll call. I'll call.

810
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:30,920
Do you have a suite perhaps that's a bit
more roomy for us?

811
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:35,591
The Makuaha Room. Yes.
Is that your biggest room? It sounds big.

812
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:40,012
But it is, I see. I see.
And for the whole day?

813
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:44,767
Okay, so this is it.
We're here, we're stuck.

814
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:48,979
Okay, then we'll make do. Thank you.

815
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,191
Looks like we are here to stay,
definitely...

816
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:55,820
...so let's settle in, and...

817
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,279
...start.

818
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:01,700
Oh, no.

819
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:07,706
Well, I'd like to welcome
everybody here.

820
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,375
Let me just...

821
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:14,964
Indulge me for a second. I think you might
be more comfortable if I move the chair...

822
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,135
Thattaboy, Mark.

823
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:28,185
We have an old saying at ADM.
I think it applies here.

824
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:32,022
"It's better to have the elephants
inside the tent pissing out...

825
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:35,109
...than outside the tent pissing in."

826
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,278
Outside piss?

827
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,156
It's better to be part of the group.

828
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,908
What he's saying is,
the customers are our enemy.

829
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:44,994
The competitors are our friend.

830
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:49,665
It's important we have all the producers
involved, including the Cheil Corporation.

831
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:53,586
I want to know why we have been
excluded from association in the past.

832
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:55,921
We need to be part of this.

833
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:59,675
- Yeah.
- How can we know that ADM Will stay...

834
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,594
...at agreed-upon levels?

835
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:06,849
Well, it would be our preference
that we simply trust each other.

836
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,143
And if we find out someone's
been lying...

837
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:12,771
...we'll just hire some Mafia figure
to rub you out.

838
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,316
That's just a little bit of levity...

839
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:19,111
...but the point is
that if we can't trust each other...

840
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,071
...ain't gonna work.

841
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,742
You are okay with that?

842
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:28,120
Yes. I am all right.

843
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:33,792
So, what are we saying?

844
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:38,297
Well, what,
do you have a language problem, Mark?

845
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:43,469
Then we are ail...

846
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,804
- Agreed.
- Yes.

847
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,977
Agreement. You heard it.

848
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:54,355
- Congratulations.
- Jury's gonna love that.

849
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:55,898
Well done. You did it.

850
00:53:56,066 --> 00:54:00,986
Christ. How about this guy Whitacre?
What's his story?

851
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,822
- What do you mean?
- What's his agenda?

852
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:08,160
The guy's making 350 grand a year,
moving up and he turns informer.

853
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:12,039
When does that happen?
Is the money going up his nose?

854
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:17,002
Some woman somewhere with a kid he's
seeing on one of these business trips?

855
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,754
What's his story?

856
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,139
We wanted to show you this.

857
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:32,685
That's a picture of Mark Whitacre
and his family.

858
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:35,437
We carry that with us all the time...

859
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:39,024
...as a constant reminder
that he is a real person...

860
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,694
...with a real family depending on him.

861
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:45,114
The only reason we have any
of these tapes is because of this man.

862
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:49,285
We want to know
when the time comes...

863
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,203
...if he loses his job...

864
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,290
...will the government
stand behind him?

865
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:58,585
Mark, are you an idiot?
- Ginger, I'll be the only one left.

866
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:02,548
Mick will be gone. Terry will be gone.
Dwayne will be gone.

867
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,551
I am a scientist
and I understand the business side.

868
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,594
I'm the only one qualified to run ADM.

869
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:10,389
Mark, that's completely illogical.

870
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,225
How can you stay there
when you've taken down the company?

871
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,227
Because they need me
to run the company.

872
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:18,981
First of all, I'm extremely valuable
to the company.

873
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,608
And secondly, I did the right thing.

874
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:25,404
Okay? The board is gonna see that.
The board's gonna respect that.

875
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:28,991
It's the FBI, right?
They're brainwashing you.

876
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,745
It's Brian Shepard putting ideas
in your head to keep you working for him.

877
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:36,165
I'm telling you, they will make me
the next president of ADM.

878
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,418
So this is it, huh?
Yup.

879
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,754
How's your family doing?

880
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,674
Good. They're gonna be at an amusement
park when you guys make your move.

881
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:49,011
Whatever happens tomorrow,
I think it's in your best interest...

882
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,348
...to get an attorney who's gonna
represent your interests alone.

883
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:55,726
- You want me to get an attorney now?
- No, not now.

884
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:59,521
First, the company lawyers
are gonna come to all the executives...

885
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,774
...with a list of attorneys to pick from.

886
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:05,402
You've gotta understand,
these attorneys are paid for by ADM.

887
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,779
They don't represent you.

888
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:11,116
Do not pick one of these attorneys.
Tell them you have your own attorney.

889
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:14,870
You need to tell them that you're
cooperating with the government.

890
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,414
It's perfectly reasonable
for you to cooperate.

891
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:21,085
I think I know a lawyer in Decatur.
I'll talk to him.

892
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,711
The town is too small.

893
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:27,216
I'm sure you've met lawyers in your
business dealings that could handle this.

894
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,634
Definitely.

895
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,595
Now, Mark? Mark?

896
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,723
Once this starts,
it is going to be intense.

897
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:39,061
They are going to know that somebody
was on the inside working with us.

898
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:42,731
And they're gonna do almost anything
to find out who it is.

899
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:46,151
But you guys still think I'm gonna be okay
at the company, right?

900
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:51,323
I mean, you guys are gonna take
down the bad guys, but I'll be okay, right?

901
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:56,036
Well, I think it's important
to remember...

902
00:56:56,204 --> 00:57:00,499
...what we talked about before,
and what we're talking about right now...

903
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,086
...is tell them...

904
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,673
- ...you're cooperating with the government.
- I know.

905
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:11,718
But I'm just asking if you guys think
I'm gonna be okay at the company.

906
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:15,013
The corporate culture's
gonna change a little bit for you.

907
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:17,057
I should say so.

908
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,893
- Yeah.
- We should just focus on the raid.

909
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:21,103
- Right?
- Yes.

910
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:08,400
- Mark, you're making that up.
- No, Archer, the A in ADM...

911
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:12,237
...choked to death, 1947,
on a chicken bone.

912
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,364
Fact. Fact.

913
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:17,534
Well, there you have it,
from Mark Whitacre, Ph.D.

914
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:21,163
You know what the Ph.D. stands for,
don't you? Piled Higher and Deeper.

915
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:26,043
Heh. Let me guess. Daniels was killed
by a pig and the cows got Midland.

916
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,342
A chicken got Archer.
I'll tell you, 50 years later...

917
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,428
...our deals with Tyson Farms,
Foster Farms...

918
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,055
...what's the body count?

919
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:42,768
Mr. Wilson, Mr. Whitacre,
I'm Bob Herndon and I'm an FBI agent.

920
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,395
- This is Special Agent Shepard.
- What is going on?

921
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:48,273
- Mr. Whitacre, would you come with me?
I don't...

922
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:51,693
- I have no idea what this is about.
- Mr. Whitacre, please.

923
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,946
- Could you come with us?
- Do I need a lawyer?

924
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:56,240
A lawyer? Terry.
- Excuse me.

925
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:59,243
I saved a guy once at a restaurant
in Hong Kong.

926
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:02,913
He was choking and I got him
to throw himself over the back of his chair.

927
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:06,416
He sends me cards on holidays
just to say thanks.

928
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,169
Tells me what his kids are studying.
He remembers me.

929
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,381
You can take first-aid courses
from your local fire department.

930
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:16,260
You got a reason for embarrassing my
colleague and I in front of a prospect?

931
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,136
This is a serious matter.

932
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:21,932
It involves an international investigation
into price fixing.

933
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:25,018
We have seen you and your boss,
Mick Andreas...

934
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,813
...conspire with your competitors
to fix prices.

935
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,524
We have seen you tell others to do it.

936
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,150
There will be indictments.

937
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,486
Search warrants have been issued.

938
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:39,825
And some people, people who you know
and work with, will be going to jail.

939
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,494
Look at that.

940
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:46,039
Look at that. Look at Terry and Bob.

941
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:49,376
Oh, I wish I could be a fly on that wall.

942
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:52,546
Oh, hey, I was good, right?
Didn't I seem really scared?

943
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:54,214
I actually felt scared.

944
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,466
Remember what we told you, all right?

945
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,885
Tell them you're that cooperating
first thing...

946
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:02,514
- ...and do not take one of their lawyers.
- Right. No.

947
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:03,849
What'd you say to your guy?

948
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,851
Nothing, I told him nothing. Slow down.

949
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,352
Me neither. I said nothing.

950
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,397
He said that he had price-fixing
tapes. What the fuck is that?

951
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:14,443
Well, I bet they have the phones
tapped. I always said that. It's the phones.

952
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:17,362
I can't believe they would
pull this shit on Dwayne Andreas.

953
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,489
Look, I get phone calls
from time to time.

954
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:21,241
I know, I know.

955
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:23,118
Oh, God.

956
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,662
We're going to the lawyers.
I don't want phones.

957
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:26,997
See? The phones.

958
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,499
They hit everybody.
My dad, Schmidt, Randall.

959
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:30,709
Oh, fuck me.

960
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,045
No, they played me a tape of me.

961
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:36,298
Some meeting with the fucking Japanese.
I called the lawyers.

962
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,717
- We're gonna go there.
- Yeah? They played a tape.

963
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:42,554
- How the fuck did they get a tape?
- I really don't think they have that much.

964
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:45,098
When you factor in everything
we've done for them...

965
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:48,393
...this will be a 10-year thing
for the lawyers. Maybe a fine.

966
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:52,314
That's all this is ever gonna be.
Trust me.

967
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,484
- How's it going?
- Good.

968
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,402
FBI.

969
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:02,324
Yeah, he's here.
I got Agent Temples for Attorney Mutchnik.

970
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,578
This is James Mutchnik.

971
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,081
Just interviewed
an ADM employee, Kirk Schmidt.

972
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:14,211
Schmidt knew we were coming.
Says he knew about the raid days ago.

973
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,381
He says Whitacre told him.

974
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:19,758
Thanks.

975
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:23,345
- He sees you sitting in the window and...
- Bob. Brian.

976
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,263
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

977
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:32,938
That was amazing.
You guys should have seen it.

978
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:36,274
Oh, Terry was so scared,
and Mick and the lawyers, they were just...

979
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,151
- They were pissed.
That's super.

980
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,696
They thought you guys
gave me the once-over.

981
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,198
They're like, "You all right?"
I'm going, "Yeah."

982
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,451
- Did you make a tape?
- Yeah, I made a tape. A great one.

983
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:47,911
Really good.

984
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,871
So it's over, then.

985
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,081
Mark...

986
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,542
...who did you tell?

987
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:58,755
- What?
- Who else did you tell about the raid?

988
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:04,970
Well...

989
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:07,764
I had to tell my secretary.

990
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:12,602
Guys, I'm the head
of the bioproducts division.

991
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:16,106
She has to know where to get in touch
with me. I told her months ago.

992
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:19,818
So all I said was,
"Liz, I'm doing some work with the FBI.

993
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:22,028
I might be out of touch for a while."

994
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:26,491
That's it.
She had no idea about our case.

995
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:36,168
I'm pretty sure I've mentioned the name
Kathy Dougherty a time or two...

996
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:37,669
...in my division.

997
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:43,341
Kathy is a friend. She is a trusted ally.

998
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:44,968
I didn't want her to be scared.

999
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:48,013
Why would you do that, Mark?
Why would you tell Dougherty?

1000
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:53,018
Because I didn't want her to be scared.
I trust her.

1001
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,604
- Guys, we can trust Kathy.
- Who else?

1002
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,939
Don't jack us around, Mark.

1003
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,361
Mm.

1004
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:06,782
Kirk Schmidt. I mean, Schmidty...

1005
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,160
Look, I was afraid that he wouldn't
say anything to you guys.

1006
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,746
That he'd clam up on account
of he's loyal to me.

1007
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:15,373
You could have ruined
this entire operation.

1008
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,834
Has anything gone wrong?
Has anything gone wrong?

1009
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:19,461
Time out. Time out. Time out.

1010
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:25,467
Mark, you know what you did,
in our eyes, was wrong.

1011
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:31,056
- It was supposed to be a secret.
Look, we can get past this.

1012
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:35,101
But is there anything else
that we need to know?

1013
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:36,895
No.

1014
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,397
No, not that I can think of.

1015
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,739
Remember...

1016
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,908
...tell them you're getting
your own lawyer.

1017
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,577
I know about the lawyers, Brian!

1018
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:41,793
Mark Whitacre, Aubrey Daniel.

1019
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,588
Pleasure to meet you.
I'm representing ADM in this matter.

1020
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:45,797
Okay.

1021
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:49,092
- This is John Dowd, a colleague of mine.
- Good morning, John.

1022
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,846
Dwayne has filled us in
on your responsibilities here, so...

1023
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:56,933
Aubrey prosecuted Lieutenant Calley
after the My Lai massacre in Vietnam...

1024
01:04:57,101 --> 01:05:00,562
...so this ought to be a cakewalk
for him.

1025
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,981
We were hoping you'd have time
to talk to John.

1026
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,650
- Sure.
- ADM's behind you on this, Mark.

1027
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:08,486
Dad and I want all the key people
to know...

1028
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:10,989
...that we're gonna be paying
all your legal fees.

1029
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,658
Oh, great. Great.
Thank you, that's great.

1030
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:17,329
Then... Then we'll let you fellas
get acquainted, okay?

1031
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:18,580
Okay.

1032
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:24,252
- How you holding up, Mark? Thanks.
- Good. Please, sit down.

1033
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:32,135
- John, can I ask you something?
- Sure, anything.

1034
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:36,681
If I say something to you, are you allowed
to say anything to Mick and Dwayne?

1035
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,544
Oh. Here we go.

1036
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:21,226
I need to tell you I'm gonna
be cooperating with the FBI.

1037
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,353
They have hundreds of tapes.

1038
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:26,523
They know all about lysine.

1039
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:30,568
And John here agrees with me
I should be getting another lawyer.

1040
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:33,363
Oh. No question about it.

1041
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:39,077
I want to say sorry
for everything that's happened.

1042
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:40,537
Sorry?

1043
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:43,331
What's that?

1044
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:46,543
It feels good to talk, to clear the air.

1045
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,753
You get to be like a balloon
after a while...

1046
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:52,757
...a balloon looking for a pin
to bump into and relieve the pressure.

1047
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:56,386
You could get sick from keeping it inside
and get a tumor or something.

1048
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:57,929
I didn't ask for that.

1049
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,849
I have a friend from school
who has a law practice.

1050
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:04,185
And he's always telling me
how they can't talk about their cases.

1051
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,730
Like in The Firm.
You can tell them anything.

1052
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:11,067
They have to keep it to themselves or they
get in a lot of trouble. They're boxed.

1053
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:13,236
That's what they say: boxed.

1054
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:16,489
So there wasn't a saboteur
at all. You made that up?

1055
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:19,492
Well, maybe there was.
I mean, there could have been.

1056
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,952
Okay.

1057
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,038
ADM steals technology
from the Japanese...

1058
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:26,458
...so I wouldn't put it past the Japanese
to do the same thing to us.

1059
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:29,127
But once I told the FBI
that I'd made that part up...

1060
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:33,631
...they said I had very little choice
but to be a cooperating witness.

1061
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,802
And you began making tapes.
How many tapes did you make?

1062
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:41,056
There are over 200 tapes.

1063
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:43,141
Ooh.

1064
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:47,562
There are so many really nice people
in the world, people who want to help out.

1065
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,814
Good neighbors, good listeners.

1066
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:52,067
Like when they had floods
in Mississippi...

1067
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:54,903
...and people lose everything
and are sleeping in a gym...

1068
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:59,365
...someone always shows up with a warm
coat and a homemade pot roast.

1069
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:04,037
That's why Ginger and I bought that girl
a computer after she had the spine injury.

1070
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:06,623
That kind of thing
really makes a difference.

1071
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,666
Jim here strikes me as that kind of guy.

1072
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:12,295
He's the one-in-a-hundred guy who, when
you come into the emergency room...

1073
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:14,547
...you thank your lucky stars
it's his watch.

1074
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:18,093
...illegal campaign contributions,
whatever. Whatever we're talking about.

1075
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,678
So then I'd come back.
Two nights a week or so...

1076
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:23,807
...Brian and Bob and l
would get together, and we'd...

1077
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:27,352
You know, we'd work it.
We'd build the investigation.

1078
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,938
Get everything we needed,
gather all the information.

1079
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,190
Then we went to DOJ,
briefed those lawyers...

1080
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:36,152
...and before you knew it, we were hitting
ADM, raiding the place, taking it down.

1081
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,738
And for how long did you do this?
Work as an informant?

1082
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:42,367
Ahh, ooh. Two and a half years.

1083
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:46,663
Two and a half years.

1084
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:48,540
You know, and I always thought...

1085
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:52,043
...there'd still be a place for me at ADM
when this whole thing was over.

1086
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,420
I still have a lot of friends there.

1087
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:55,630
A lot of friends.

1088
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:00,385
Hey, Mark...

1089
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:04,806
...it's very important to your case you
not discuss this with anyone else. Okay?

1090
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:09,978
These people you work with, your friends,
they could end up being witnesses.

1091
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:14,023
Bob and I are the only people
you talk to about this from now on.

1092
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:17,485
All right? And I want you to know
that you can tell us anything.

1093
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,196
- Okay. Yeah.
Okay?

1094
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:24,534
Well, they kept coming to the house
and they only had ADM's side of the story.

1095
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:27,287
Did you
talk to The Wall Street Journal, Mark?

1096
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:30,748
What did you say? It's real important
that you not talk to the press.

1097
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:34,210
Me? I told them I had no comment,
but it didn't matter.

1098
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:37,422
They had the story anyway.
They already had it.

1099
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:42,552
Did you see my stipple portrait?
It's pretty good.

1100
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,435
Oh, shit.

1101
01:09:57,234 --> 01:10:00,778
I'd appreciate any comment you
can make on the allegations on the TV.

1102
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:03,281
Just a quick comment.
What do you have to say?

1103
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:08,536
I came out to tell you that I'm not allowed
to talk to the press at this time.

1104
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:11,122
At least any comment
on the effects of your actions...

1105
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,124
...on ADM's declining stock prices?

1106
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:16,461
What's been the reaction
of your friends being taped?

1107
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:19,756
Well, I'm a person of interest in an
ongoing investigation.

1108
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:22,592
Do you believe you and your
family can stay in Decatur?

1109
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,594
Has the government made arrangements
to move you?

1110
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:31,476
We're still getting
the threatening phone calls.

1111
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:34,771
And I know for a fact
that Dwayne and Terry...

1112
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:39,817
...have been telling people that he wasn't
a good worker and he can't be trusted.

1113
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:41,819
We told Mark.

1114
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:44,614
We told him
that he had to expect the unexpected...

1115
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,241
...that he might be attacked...

1116
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:50,119
...that he wasn't gonna win
any popularity contests for this.

1117
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:53,331
Well, he just mopes around here
all day...

1118
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:56,918
...watching the news,
looking for a glimpse of himself.

1119
01:10:57,086 --> 01:11:02,173
Or he's calling someone from ADM,
trying to get the latest gossip.

1120
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:07,470
Maybe you guys should get out of town
until the hearings start.

1121
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,681
He's got to stop talking to people.

1122
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,812
Well, the FBI never forced me
to cooperate.

1123
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:17,772
I don't owe Brian Shepard the truth.

1124
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:22,485
I gave Brian Shepard two and a half years
and now I have legal bills to show for it.

1125
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:25,154
And I'm the good guy in this,
the guy who took on ADM.

1126
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:29,033
Is Brian Shepard gonna lose his job
for that? His standard of living?

1127
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:32,704
I've gone to the school on career day
and talked about biochemistry...

1128
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:34,831
...and the career opportunities available.

1129
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,209
Can Brian Shepard and Bob Herndon
say that? I'm the white hat.

1130
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:42,547
I did enough for Brian Shepard.
Who's gonna take care of me?

1131
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:45,466
Who has a plaque for
the Mark Whitacre Environmental Award?

1132
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,885
Where are your friends when it's dump
on Whitacre?

1133
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:50,388
Where's the pot roast
and the warm coat?

1134
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:25,131
You can see where he pasted it.

1135
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,508
He's a fucking forger.

1136
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:40,605
- Mark Whitacre.
- Hello, Mark. It's Aubrey Daniel.

1137
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:44,525
Listen, I'm here in Mick Andreas's office
and we were wondering:

1138
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:48,946
Does the name Lennart Thorstensson
mean anything to you?

1139
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:55,286
What about Nordkron Chemie?
Does that ring a bell?

1140
01:12:57,998 --> 01:13:00,375
I'll have someone get back to you
on that.

1141
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:03,127
Oh, sure. You do that.

1142
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:07,965
- He's going to call us back.
- Sure.

1143
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:27,777
My lawyer's telling me not to talk
to you guys, but...

1144
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:30,696
...there's something I've been wanting
to talk to you about.

1145
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:32,532
Don't tell us anything.

1146
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:36,953
You have a lawyer now
and it's not like it was before.

1147
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:39,497
We are not asking you.

1148
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:43,334
Okay, what if I just put out
some hypotheticals?

1149
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:48,506
And, you know, I'll talk about
certain financial situations...

1150
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:52,343
...and you guys can tell me if they're wrong
or how serious they might be.

1151
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:53,636
Okay, for instance...

1152
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,014
...what if...

1153
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:02,061
...a company gave an executive a car?
You know, a corporate car.

1154
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:04,689
And instead of driving that to work...

1155
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:08,359
...he drove his personal car and he gave
the company car to his daughter.

1156
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:11,529
Would that be a problem?

1157
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:14,824
That's it?

1158
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:17,201
That's the hypothetical?

1159
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:20,496
That shouldn't be a problem.

1160
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:23,166
Okay.

1161
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:27,211
What if it was a corporate plane...

1162
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:31,090
...and the executive was using that
for personal use?

1163
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:33,384
Oh. Basically the same thing.

1164
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:36,053
Maybe some IRS issues, but...

1165
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:38,848
Okay.

1166
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:42,518
What if...

1167
01:14:42,686 --> 01:14:44,687
...it was standard practice at ADM...

1168
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:49,734
...for executives to regularly accept
kickbacks in cash?

1169
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:58,701
How much money
are we talking about...

1170
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:00,786
...Mark?

1171
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:06,042
Well, Brian, hypothetically, $500,000.

1172
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,836
- How much?
- It's the way things are done there.

1173
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:12,507
Okay? I'm not the only one
who was doing it.

1174
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:15,218
Everybody's doing it.

1175
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:18,930
When did this start, Mark?

1176
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:22,099
December 1991.

1177
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:29,106
You, uh, ahem...

1178
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:31,275
How were you paid?

1179
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:33,778
Paid by check.

1180
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:36,155
A check is deposited
in various accounts...

1181
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:41,786
...and always under the amount
of $10,000.

1182
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:45,540
And did any of these checks come in...

1183
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,626
...after we met?

1184
01:15:53,006 --> 01:15:54,298
Maybe.

1185
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:03,015
Two-point-five million dollars,
deposited into an account in Switzerland...

1186
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:06,227
...while Mark Whitacre was there
on ADM business.

1187
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,895
Now, we have sworn testimony...

1188
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:11,107
...from Mr. Lennart Thorstensson
of the ABP Corporation...

1189
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:16,445
...that he has never seen this contract,
and that his signature is forged.

1190
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:20,992
Neither he nor his company
have ever received this check.

1191
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:24,370
Now, it is clear to us
that Mark Whitacre...

1192
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:27,582
...driven by his own boundless ambition
to take over ADM...

1193
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,834
...has attempted
to frame his superiors...

1194
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:33,129
...in a price-fixing conspiracy
of his own invention.

1195
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:35,339
His cooperation with the government...

1196
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:39,302
...merely a smokescreen
to hide his lying, cheating and stealing.

1197
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:41,679
We have additional information...

1198
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:45,141
...that we are willing to share
with Attorney General Reno...

1199
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:48,352
...that the money has since been moved
to Grand Cayman...

1200
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:52,356
...with the full knowledge and complicity
of Whitacre's FBI partners.

1201
01:16:53,358 --> 01:16:56,777
What are they accusing
me of? I want the specifics.

1202
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,946
Are they saying I'm in cahoots
with the guy?

1203
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,324
Paragraph 8
in our agreement with Whitacre...

1204
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:04,035
...states that his actions
are directly attributable...

1205
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:06,704
...to the FBI
and the United States government.

1206
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:10,625
They're saying he stole two and a half
million dollars while we were running him.

1207
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:14,170
But how could we know what he
was doing? He came to us.

1208
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:17,214
The question they're asking isn't
"How could we know?"

1209
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:18,758
It's "Why didn't we know?"

1210
01:17:18,925 --> 01:17:22,303
No. The question is,
"Were they price fixing?"

1211
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:25,723
The investigation has shifted
from ADM to Whitacre.

1212
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:29,393
Ha. Of course.
ADM decides Whitacre's a thief...

1213
01:17:29,561 --> 01:17:31,729
...as soon as they find out
he's working for us.

1214
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:34,899
Who's counting money
if they can lose two and a half million...

1215
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,026
...for years, then find it in a few hours?

1216
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,235
We gotta call Mark.

1217
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:41,405
I don't want you to do that.
- We're taking you off.

1218
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:45,993
That's it?

1219
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:49,330
We're done?

1220
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:53,417
I thought the FBI never hung a witness
out to dry.

1221
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:55,753
He's not a witness anymore.
He's a target.

1222
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:59,715
I only kept a million and
a half dollars. And Mick knew about it.

1223
01:17:59,883 --> 01:18:02,551
He knows these things went on.
Who do you think taught me?

1224
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:05,596
You can't bullshit these people.
Who knows what they know?

1225
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:07,515
We gotta go in with the whole story.

1226
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:11,602
It gets bad for you if you tell them you'll
confess and don't. Then you're screwed.

1227
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,271
This is it.
What you have in front of you, that is it.

1228
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:17,441
I've found every bank statement,
every record.

1229
01:18:18,568 --> 01:18:20,778
Why would I hide anything
from you guys?

1230
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:23,072
This is it.

1231
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:42,925
I haven't been telling you guys the whole
truth, but I'm gonna clear that up in there.

1232
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:46,262
- What?
- No, we gotta get you out of here.

1233
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,264
No, no, I want to tell.

1234
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:52,685
Mr. Whitacre's conduct constitutes
a breach of agreement...

1235
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:54,145
...with the U.S. government.

1236
01:18:54,312 --> 01:18:56,564
He is no longer a cooperating witness.

1237
01:18:58,442 --> 01:19:01,318
This is outrageous.
My client has given you years of his life.

1238
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:03,946
Clearly, he made mistakes,
but he made your case.

1239
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:06,741
We are not here to discuss the case
against ADM.

1240
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:09,160
Mr. Whitacre, my name is Ed Herbst...

1241
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:12,496
...and I am with the FBI's
Economic Crimes Unit.

1242
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:14,665
This is Mary Spearing
and Don McKay...

1243
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:17,209
...from the Department
of Justice Fraud Division.

1244
01:19:17,377 --> 01:19:19,837
And we were wondering
if you could tell us...

1245
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:23,632
...when your criminal conduct
at ADM began.

1246
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:27,553
In early 1992...

1247
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:33,184
...I was taught how things are done
there by Mick Andreas...

1248
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:36,854
...who showed me
how to use embezzlements...

1249
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:40,357
...and kickbacks
in order to make money tax-free.

1250
01:19:40,525 --> 01:19:41,859
My client is voluntarily...

1251
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:45,946
No, I'm aware that the fraud
that I perpetrated...

1252
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:48,365
...was wrong and...

1253
01:19:48,533 --> 01:19:50,201
...I accept responsibility.

1254
01:19:50,702 --> 01:19:52,495
How did you receive the money?

1255
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:56,332
By check. They would deposit the check
to my account in Decatur.

1256
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,210
They paid kickbacks in checks?

1257
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:01,629
What company would pay kickbacks
in checks?

1258
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,923
Well, I don't remember the name
of the company.

1259
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:08,636
It was, like, Agra Consulting and Trading
or something like that.

1260
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:11,388
You don't remember the company
that paid you checks?

1261
01:20:11,556 --> 01:20:13,766
It's hard to remember for me right now.

1262
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:17,394
I have things going on in my life,
in case you haven't been reading papers.

1263
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:21,565
We're coming to you. We're cooperating.
We're gonna get the money back.

1264
01:20:21,733 --> 01:20:25,736
I think this might help your memory.

1265
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:31,909
Now, where did we get those?

1266
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:36,413
These are ADM documents
showing forging of signatures.

1267
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:40,960
Didn't these people see The Firm?
Or read the book?

1268
01:20:41,127 --> 01:20:44,922
It's all there. Everything they did to me,
they did to Tom Cruise.

1269
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:47,424
I'm not the one they should be mad at.

1270
01:20:47,592 --> 01:20:49,468
We can't see you anymore.

1271
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:55,432
And if you call us and start to talk
about the case, we'll have to hang up.

1272
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,936
You can talk to us about your feelings...

1273
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:00,980
...but that's it.

1274
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:05,568
Mark, please understand.

1275
01:21:06,444 --> 01:21:10,322
It's not what we want.
We got no choice here.

1276
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:15,119
You know, the thing of it is,
all of my anger, all of my frustration...

1277
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:18,247
...stems from my work with you guys.

1278
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:20,457
And all this crap in the paper...

1279
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:24,211
My kids are seeing this.

1280
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:27,798
And it's all just dump on Mark Whitacre.

1281
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:32,970
Remember, Mark, we told you
it would be impossible to predict...

1282
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:35,472
...what would happen
when the case went public.

1283
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:38,475
You never told us
about the $5 million you took.

1284
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:41,145
I don't see what that has to do
with the price fixing.

1285
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:43,939
He worked for you
for two and a half years.

1286
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:46,942
He risked his career, his home...

1287
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:53,032
...and now you just turn your back on him
and leave us out here.

1288
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:54,825
Yes, Ginger.

1289
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:57,578
The reason we came here today...

1290
01:21:58,955 --> 01:22:03,167
...is because we're concerned
about your and Mark's well-being.

1291
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:09,673
It's important you tell the people
in Washington everything tomorrow.

1292
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:11,467
One hundred percent.

1293
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:15,846
You would have nothing without him,
and you know it.

1294
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:19,224
He's being used by the government,
then thrown away...

1295
01:22:19,392 --> 01:22:23,687
...because it's easier to go after Mark
Whitacre than anyone named Andreas.

1296
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:29,944
We took the kids one year
to the Renaissance festival.

1297
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:31,570
You get to be the white knight.

1298
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:35,324
The kids get to ride a horse and joust
against the forces of darkness.

1299
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:39,161
The white knight always wins. The forces
of darkness fall onto an old mattress.

1300
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:42,873
Someone plays a lute
and plays a song from medieval times.

1301
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:45,960
It was 90 degrees,
and the heat and humidity index...

1302
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:48,295
...I can't even remember
what the radio said.

1303
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:51,882
We were next in line and the mare
collapsed, went down in a heap.

1304
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:55,970
Ginger was eating Ye Olde Drumstick
and she dropped it. The kids were crying.

1305
01:22:56,137 --> 01:23:00,015
And I remember this farmer saying
he had a gun in his truck. Just like that.

1306
01:23:00,183 --> 01:23:02,601
From the white knight
to a gun in the truck.

1307
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:05,229
They had everyone turn
before they put the animal down.

1308
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:08,232
But even if you couldn't see,
you could still hear.

1309
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,359
How do you get that back?

1310
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:12,569
How does that get to be fair?

1311
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:16,073
Well, he just kept buying things.

1312
01:23:16,908 --> 01:23:18,909
We had eight cars.

1313
01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:22,413
Three of them we never even used.

1314
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:26,166
And how else has he changed?

1315
01:23:28,461 --> 01:23:31,588
Well, I was always the one
with the temper.

1316
01:23:31,756 --> 01:23:36,010
- Mm-hm.
- And Corky was the happy one.

1317
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:37,761
But that's changed too.

1318
01:23:37,929 --> 01:23:41,223
- There's one in Hong Kong.
Mm-hm.

1319
01:23:41,391 --> 01:23:44,184
Then there are the accounts
in Switzerland and Grand Cayman.

1320
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:45,811
Right, right.

1321
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:50,065
Other things. There's a lawyer in New
York who's got a million dollars of mine.

1322
01:23:50,233 --> 01:23:52,443
Have you told your attorney
about these?

1323
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:55,195
No, I don't need to tell...

1324
01:23:57,282 --> 01:24:00,451
Mark, you need to tell your attorney
about these accounts.

1325
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:04,371
The assets were obtained legally.
I don't even know if I can trust him.

1326
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:08,125
Has anyone in your family ever
been diagnosed with bipolar disorder?

1327
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:10,419
You know, manic depressive?

1328
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:16,925
I have an aunt
that they used to say that about.

1329
01:24:17,093 --> 01:24:18,594
Yeah?

1330
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:21,638
In terms of my parents, I can't be sure.

1331
01:24:21,806 --> 01:24:25,309
My parents died in an automobile accident
when I was 6.

1332
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:29,688
I was adopted by a wealthy man in Ohio.
He owned amusement parks.

1333
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:32,649
I caught a big break there, big break.

1334
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:35,444
So my client's here to cooperate fully.

1335
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:38,072
Agent D'Angelo,
if you have any questions.

1336
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:42,076
This is your chance to put everything
on the table.

1337
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,328
This is your chance to redeem yourself.

1338
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:48,749
But if you're not going to be completely
honest, just stop talking now.

1339
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:51,668
I understand that.

1340
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:55,631
I just want to tell you I feel...

1341
01:24:56,674 --> 01:24:59,009
...bad. I'm so sorry.

1342
01:25:01,387 --> 01:25:04,598
The last time we spoke,
I was under a great deal of stress.

1343
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:07,226
And I said some things
that weren't true.

1344
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:10,854
I want to clear that up.

1345
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:16,068
The first kickback was in 1992.

1346
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:18,529
Mick knew all about it.

1347
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:21,698
He told me there were gonna
be opportunities to take kickbacks...

1348
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:24,701
...on some of the contracts coming out
of Asia and Europe...

1349
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:27,287
...that were ADM contracts.

1350
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:31,458
Was there anyone else involved?

1351
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:36,630
So, Mr. Richter, we have...

1352
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:41,885
...money leaving your account
here and here...

1353
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:43,720
...and here.

1354
01:25:43,888 --> 01:25:48,475
And it's going into Whitacre's account...

1355
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:51,228
...his wife Ginger's account...

1356
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:54,231
...and this is going
to Whitacre's parents' account.

1357
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:57,860
Like I said, those are loans.

1358
01:25:58,486 --> 01:25:59,653
Uh-huh.

1359
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:04,324
He had me set up a company,
Nordkron Chemie...

1360
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:08,912
...and just, like, issue
these fake invoices to ADM.

1361
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,582
And there was a bank account
in Hamburg...

1362
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:16,086
...and so I would get a check
for like two hundred grand...

1363
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:18,839
...and most of it would go back to Mark.

1364
01:26:19,924 --> 01:26:22,426
Ahem. Okay, look.

1365
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:26,763
We know you're looking out
for your friend Mark...

1366
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,600
...but your story doesn't seem true.

1367
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:35,147
You're right, it's not true.

1368
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:37,107
All the money went to Mark.

1369
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:39,151
When did it start?

1370
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:42,946
Mark told me about this Nigerian thing
he got in the mail.

1371
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:46,909
You know about these schemes
with the Nigerian letters?

1372
01:26:47,076 --> 01:26:49,953
The 419 fraud?
Yeah, we see it every day.

1373
01:26:50,121 --> 01:26:54,625
You get a letter from some official
in Nigeria asking for a few grand to help.

1374
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:57,794
- They promise a percentage of the money.
- Exactly.

1375
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:02,257
You ever wonder who was dumb enough
to fall for something like that?

1376
01:27:05,094 --> 01:27:07,262
This is really embarrassing.

1377
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:12,726
So how much money would you say
you made from your illegal activities?

1378
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:23,779
Seven-point-seven million dollars.

1379
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:28,533
But like I said, Mick knew all about that,
you know?

1380
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:30,661
He endorsed that kind of behavior.

1381
01:27:31,996 --> 01:27:34,957
So not five, but seven-point-seven?

1382
01:27:35,124 --> 01:27:36,333
Seven-point-seven.

1383
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:40,754
Jim, we all understand special
consideration, but we've got your guy.

1384
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:43,924
And these are cases we know
we can convict.

1385
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:47,177
Forty-five counts of wire fraud...

1386
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:50,013
...and money laundering
and tax evasion.

1387
01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:52,975
So explain to us,
where is the wiggle room?

1388
01:27:53,142 --> 01:27:58,355
I'm not stupid. Mark committed a crime.
He stole nine million dollars.

1389
01:27:58,815 --> 01:28:00,357
That's pretty indefensible.

1390
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:03,944
But these guys at ADM, they stole
hundreds of millions of dollars...

1391
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:06,321
...from innocent people
all around the world.

1392
01:28:06,489 --> 01:28:09,408
Mark showed that white guys in suits
getting together...

1393
01:28:09,575 --> 01:28:11,702
...that's not a meeting,
it's a crime scene.

1394
01:28:11,869 --> 01:28:15,872
And not only did he tell you about it,
he got the evidence to prove it. Ha.

1395
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:20,544
When agents go undercover for the FBI,
they get trained for the stresses.

1396
01:28:20,753 --> 01:28:24,464
We hear this all the time.
How easy it is for a trained agent to crack.

1397
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:29,052
I mean, here's Mark, a civilian,
with no training.

1398
01:28:29,762 --> 01:28:31,638
But you guys just shove him in there.

1399
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:36,310
You tell him to go for it without any
training to make sure he doesn't crack.

1400
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:50,407
Ah! Baby.

1401
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:59,750
Ginger.

1402
01:29:02,795 --> 01:29:04,004
They kidnapped me.

1403
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,882
They put me in a car.
They drove me around for 20 minutes.

1404
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:08,884
- They wouldn't let me out.
- Oh, my gosh.

1405
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:11,136
- My leg.
- Oh, Mark.

1406
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:13,263
It's all cramped.

1407
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:15,265
Who did this? Who took you?

1408
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:20,103
It's obvious. Look at my jacket.
These people mean business.

1409
01:29:20,646 --> 01:29:21,855
I was abducted.

1410
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:26,693
I was thrown into the back
of a light-brown Dodge Dynasty...

1411
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:29,613
...by two thugs...

1412
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:33,408
...and driven around
in a 20-minute joyride.

1413
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:36,370
And basically, I was told...

1414
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:39,664
...you know, forget everything
that isn't on tape...

1415
01:29:39,832 --> 01:29:45,212
...and you can forget about bringing it up
in a courtroom or for the media.

1416
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,589
Did the men identify themselves?

1417
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:50,217
I think we know who sent them.

1418
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:54,638
And they sawed the locks
off the door, like Mafia thugs.

1419
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:57,808
Yeah, on each side, so I was trapped.

1420
01:29:57,975 --> 01:30:01,311
You were trapped.
You couldn't roll down the window.

1421
01:30:01,604 --> 01:30:02,979
No.

1422
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:05,941
Where was the FBI in all of this?

1423
01:30:06,609 --> 01:30:10,153
Well, I think...
We think people have to realize...

1424
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:13,949
...that the FBI did the same thing.

1425
01:30:14,117 --> 01:30:17,119
I mean, they locked my husband
in an investigation...

1426
01:30:17,286 --> 01:30:20,622
...and they drove our family around
for three years.

1427
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:23,625
- Three to five years?
- Yes.

1428
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:27,629
In jail? But ADM's the bad guys.

1429
01:30:27,797 --> 01:30:32,509
Everywhere we go, it's the same story.
It's just dump on Mark Whitacre.

1430
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:34,136
You gotta focus here.

1431
01:30:34,303 --> 01:30:38,265
You stole $9 million,
and then you lied about it.

1432
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:40,350
Maybe in your head, you're good.

1433
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:44,020
To them, you're a guy who stole a lot
of money, and then lied about it.

1434
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:47,732
Ginger and I have been talking
and we'd like to file a lawsuit...

1435
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:50,777
...against Brian Shepard
and the United States government.

1436
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:53,447
Oh, my God. For what, Mark?

1437
01:30:53,614 --> 01:30:55,365
He hit me with a briefcase.

1438
01:30:58,119 --> 01:30:59,161
Mark, come on.

1439
01:31:01,414 --> 01:31:05,292
And he told me to destroy tapes
that didn't help the case.

1440
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,918
Why would Brian Shepard do that?

1441
01:31:07,086 --> 01:31:11,506
Maybe the question you should be asking
yourself is, what is Brian Shepard hiding?

1442
01:31:12,508 --> 01:31:15,177
All right. I'm telling you, okay?

1443
01:31:15,344 --> 01:31:17,220
Take the plea.

1444
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:24,519
Thanks, Jim, but...

1445
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:26,813
...we're gonna go a different way.

1446
01:31:29,942 --> 01:31:31,485
Evelyn?
What?

1447
01:31:31,652 --> 01:31:34,779
There's a reporter
from the Washington Post.

1448
01:31:34,947 --> 01:31:37,073
Has some questions about Corky.

1449
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:39,576
A reporter.

1450
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:44,206
This is Evelyn Whitacre.

1451
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:48,418
What do you mean, adopted?

1452
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:53,089
Well, as his mother, I can assure you...

1453
01:31:53,257 --> 01:31:57,761
...that my husband and l
were not killed in a car accident...

1454
01:31:57,929 --> 01:32:01,306
...and Mark was not adopted
by wealthy people.

1455
01:32:06,562 --> 01:32:11,441
Mark's been telling people that you
and I were killed in a car accident...

1456
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:14,736
...and he was adopted by rich people.

1457
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,072
What do you make of that?

1458
01:32:20,576 --> 01:32:22,661
That's kind of weird.

1459
01:32:23,746 --> 01:32:27,415
I read this study in TIME magazine
when I was at Cornell.

1460
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:30,210
There were people who never believed
I would make it...

1461
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:32,462
...into an Ivy League school.
Maybe Ginger...

1462
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:34,422
...who I met in the 8th grade.

1463
01:32:34,590 --> 01:32:37,634
And the study said that people
had nice, sympathetic feelings...

1464
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:40,637
...about people who were adopted,
and treated them better.

1465
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:43,765
So I made up this adoption story
and people did treat me better.

1466
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:47,185
When I got a job, one of my professors
told people at Ralston Purina...

1467
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:51,064
...I was this guy that had accomplished
all of this in spite of being adopted.

1468
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:53,984
So it was really other people
who spread the story, not me.

1469
01:32:54,151 --> 01:32:57,821
I admit it was wrong to start it,
it was other people who kept it going.

1470
01:32:57,989 --> 01:32:59,531
Even the people at ADM.

1471
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:01,324
My new lawyer sees that.

1472
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:06,454
Tsk. This all goes back many years...

1473
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:09,958
...before most of us were born.

1474
01:33:10,126 --> 01:33:13,336
It's bigger than any of us...

1475
01:33:13,504 --> 01:33:15,088
...and it's ongoing.

1476
01:33:16,299 --> 01:33:19,050
I know you're skeptical,
but I've seen it.

1477
01:33:19,218 --> 01:33:23,346
My client, Mark Whitacre,
has shown it to me.

1478
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:29,144
Maybe I am just a personal-injury lawyer
from Taylorville, "Nowhere" Illinois...

1479
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:31,896
...but I tell you...

1480
01:33:32,064 --> 01:33:36,276
...I know the identity
of the master puppeteer.

1481
01:33:38,988 --> 01:33:42,532
- The who?
- The master puppeteer.

1482
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,326
And it's not who you're thinking.

1483
01:33:44,493 --> 01:33:49,205
Mark has tapes, tapes that the
government doesn't want us to hear.

1484
01:33:49,373 --> 01:33:52,667
Tapes that outline the actions
of Brian Shepard...

1485
01:33:52,835 --> 01:33:55,253
...who hit Mark Whitacre
with a briefcase...

1486
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:58,173
...while Mark was cooperating
with the government.

1487
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:01,676
My client has a letter
from his psychiatrist...

1488
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:08,391
...outlining and confirming the cruelty
perpetrated on him by Brian Shepard.

1489
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:14,939
A letter from his psychiatrist clearly
exonerating my client from all wrongdoing.

1490
01:34:17,735 --> 01:34:21,696
"It is obvious that the FBI
made some grand mistakes...

1491
01:34:21,864 --> 01:34:24,616
...in how they handled and treated you."
There's a phrase...

1492
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:27,744
"Grand mistakes."
...coming from a doctor.

1493
01:34:27,912 --> 01:34:30,413
"When one discusses suicide,
this is a red flag.

1494
01:34:30,581 --> 01:34:33,875
When one discusses how they will do it,
then it is very, very serious.

1495
01:34:34,043 --> 01:34:37,545
I also feel that the FBI requiring you
to do unethical conduct...

1496
01:34:37,713 --> 01:34:39,964
...against ADM was another blunder...

1497
01:34:40,216 --> 01:34:43,176
...that forced you into a bipolar situation.

1498
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:46,763
They should have known better
and noted that a medical problem exists.

1499
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:51,893
From a medical point of view, this is
attempted murder that the FBI did to you.

1500
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:55,105
From a legal view,
your lawyer needs to decide what to do...

1501
01:34:55,272 --> 01:34:58,525
...and what the terminology is.
I'll support you in whatever you need.

1502
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:02,195
You and your family have been through
too much turmoil with the government.

1503
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:03,947
They should know better."

1504
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:07,951
That's Dr. Miller.

1505
01:35:08,786 --> 01:35:10,954
I read the letter, Mark.

1506
01:35:11,914 --> 01:35:14,290
The problem with the letter is...

1507
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:16,918
...it's a lie.

1508
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,629
What are you talking about, Brian?

1509
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:23,633
It's on his letterhead.
That's his signature.

1510
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:27,554
- What are you talking about?
- The area code, Mark.

1511
01:35:28,347 --> 01:35:32,642
In the letterhead? The area code 847?

1512
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:36,646
This letter was written
in November 1995.

1513
01:35:36,814 --> 01:35:39,941
That area code didn't exist then.

1514
01:35:42,611 --> 01:35:47,449
Okay, but they announced that the change
was coming. I even remember that.

1515
01:35:47,616 --> 01:35:51,828
- People order their stationery early.
I thought about that.

1516
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:53,913
So I asked the phone company.

1517
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:02,672
This is the press release
announcing the new 847 area code.

1518
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:06,843
It's dated six days after your letter
was written.

1519
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:10,346
Miller could not have known about it.

1520
01:36:15,144 --> 01:36:18,688
Ron Henkoff from Fortune called
Dr. Miller and Miller confirmed the letter.

1521
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:20,982
If you talk to Henkoff...

1522
01:36:24,528 --> 01:36:28,364
Ron Henkoff from Fortune magazine...

1523
01:36:29,658 --> 01:36:32,494
...verified the letter with Dr. Miller.

1524
01:36:32,661 --> 01:36:35,622
- I talked to Dr. Miller, Mark.
You can't...

1525
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:38,458
That's a violation
of my doctor-patient confidentiality.

1526
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:43,546
That's a total violation of my doctor-patient
confidentiality. You can't call Miller.

1527
01:36:43,714 --> 01:36:48,134
Doctor-patient confidentiality
doesn't apply to forgeries.

1528
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:52,055
Then why did Fortune magazine
run the story?

1529
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:55,350
Well, why would Ron Henkoff,
for Fortune magazine...

1530
01:36:55,518 --> 01:36:57,685
...put it in a cover story?

1531
01:36:57,853 --> 01:36:59,229
Stop it, Mark.

1532
01:37:00,189 --> 01:37:02,524
Henk... If you talk to Henkoff...

1533
01:37:02,691 --> 01:37:04,984
You need to stop doing this to yourself.

1534
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:10,198
Why do you...? Why do you keep lying?

1535
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:14,702
I don't know.

1536
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:24,671
Well, I think maybe I should go back
to the hospital.

1537
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:36,724
Case 97-2001, United States
of America v. Mark Whitacre.

1538
01:37:37,893 --> 01:37:40,436
You have a right to make a statement,
if you wish.

1539
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:47,277
Thank you.

1540
01:37:49,321 --> 01:37:54,117
Uh... I really appreciate the opportunity...

1541
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:58,496
...to get up here and say a few words.
Um...

1542
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:03,167
Wow.

1543
01:38:03,961 --> 01:38:05,461
What a ride.

1544
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:07,463
Um...

1545
01:38:08,007 --> 01:38:09,799
Been a long five years.

1546
01:38:11,594 --> 01:38:13,469
A lot of memories.

1547
01:38:15,598 --> 01:38:19,809
I just really want to apologize
to a lot of people in this room...

1548
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:23,813
...and a lot of people who aren't
in this room, um...

1549
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:26,774
...for my actions.

1550
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:30,111
I'm on medication now...

1551
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:33,990
...so I'm seeing things
a lot more clearly.

1552
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:37,952
And I just really want to...

1553
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:40,914
I realize I hurt a lot of people,
and so I want to say:

1554
01:38:41,081 --> 01:38:43,666
I'm so, so, so sorry. I greatly apologize...

1555
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:49,005
...and accept responsibility for my actions.
That's it.

1556
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:50,924
Thank you.

1557
01:38:52,968 --> 01:38:58,598
To observe that Mr. Whitacre is not the
usual felon is a gross understatement.

1558
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:00,850
He's well-educated...

1559
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:05,647
...has a loving wife and family,
is well-respected in the community.

1560
01:39:05,814 --> 01:39:08,358
It's not inconceivable that,
in due course...

1561
01:39:08,525 --> 01:39:13,529
...he could have been CEO
of Archer Daniels Midland.

1562
01:39:13,697 --> 01:39:17,116
However, this court...

1563
01:39:18,077 --> 01:39:22,205
...can find no clear connection between
Mr. Whitacre's bipolar disorder...

1564
01:39:22,373 --> 01:39:26,250
...and the 45 counts of criminal
misconduct he's been charged with...

1565
01:39:26,418 --> 01:39:28,127
...just garden-variety greed.

1566
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:31,756
It's very difficult to tell
when Mr. Whitacre is telling the truth.

1567
01:39:33,342 --> 01:39:35,093
I don't think what happened is fair...

1568
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:38,304
...when you look at me compared
to Mick and Terry.

1569
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:42,392
If you go
and hold up your local grocery store...

1570
01:39:42,559 --> 01:39:44,519
...you get maybe five years in prison.

1571
01:39:44,687 --> 01:39:49,774
Mick and Terry held up every grocery
store in the world and they got three.

1572
01:39:50,025 --> 01:39:53,236
So you tell me how it makes sense
that I get nine.

1573
01:39:54,154 --> 01:39:56,072
You should consider that,
Mr. President...

1574
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:59,033
...when reviewing this request
for pardon.

1575
01:39:59,451 --> 01:40:01,452
I'd also like to take this
opportunity...

1576
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:05,039
...to apologize on behalf of myself
and my wife, Ginger...

1577
01:40:05,207 --> 01:40:07,083
...to Special Agent Brian Shepard.

1578
01:40:07,251 --> 01:40:11,587
He never hit me with a briefcase
or told me to destroy tapes.

1579
01:40:11,755 --> 01:40:16,467
The idea to sue him
came from someone inside ADM.

1580
01:40:16,635 --> 01:40:19,429
I shouldn't have listened.
I don't even remember who it was.

1581
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:25,435
While I was there at ADM, I lived so many
lives, I didn't really know who I was.

1582
01:40:26,145 --> 01:40:31,107
And I know today more who I am
and what I really want out of life.

1583
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:36,362
I've completed three postgraduate
degrees while in detention...

1584
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:39,407
...a J.D., which is, of course,
a law degree...

1585
01:40:39,575 --> 01:40:42,785
...another advanced degree
in the psychology of jury selection.

1586
01:40:43,328 --> 01:40:46,622
I sleep better here in prison
than I have in years.

1587
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:49,876
My wife, Ginger, has forgiven me.

1588
01:40:50,669 --> 01:40:53,171
She actually believes
that this incident with ADM...

1589
01:40:53,422 --> 01:40:57,467
...brought us closer together
in a marriage of over 20 years.

1590
01:40:57,885 --> 01:40:59,844
And I hope you'll allow me
to leave here...

1591
01:41:00,012 --> 01:41:03,723
...so that I can rejoin that life
with my family, my three kids...

1592
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:05,266
...two of whom are adopted.

1593
01:41:05,768 --> 01:41:09,729
Especially in light of the fact that
in large part because of my testimony...

1594
01:41:09,897 --> 01:41:13,024
...the United States government
has to date been able to collect...

1595
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:17,153
...over one billion dollars in price-fixing
fines from big businesses.

1596
01:41:17,946 --> 01:41:20,782
So that's it. Thanks.

1597
01:41:31,668 --> 01:41:33,461
Good luck with the pardon, Mark.

1598
01:41:33,629 --> 01:41:37,131
Thanks, Bob. Thanks for helping me
remember everything.

1599
01:41:37,299 --> 01:41:39,217
I wish Brian could have come.

1600
01:41:39,468 --> 01:41:43,221
- Well, he's still pretty angry.
- Yeah.

1601
01:41:43,388 --> 01:41:46,724
Well, tell him I'm real sorry.
Will you do that?

1602
01:41:46,892 --> 01:41:48,184
Sure, Mark.

1603
01:41:48,352 --> 01:41:50,686
The irony is
if I hadn't gone undercover...

1604
01:41:50,854 --> 01:41:54,482
...I never would have stole the 11
and a half million. It was my way out.

1605
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:57,985
It was my severance. What else
was I gonna do? I had to write my own.

1606
01:41:58,153 --> 01:41:59,654
Work detail.

1607
01:42:00,322 --> 01:42:01,656
See you, Bob.

1608
01:42:01,907 --> 01:42:04,700
- Eleven and a half million?
- What?

1609
01:42:04,868 --> 01:42:06,786
I thought it was nine and a half.

1610
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:09,705
- What did I say?
- You said 11 and a half.

1611
01:42:09,873 --> 01:42:13,709
You do know that the people at ADM
think you were the mole.

1612
01:42:13,877 --> 01:42:17,255
That you planted the virus,
then made it go away.

1613
01:42:17,506 --> 01:42:20,383
The 11 and a half
is with the interest.

1614
01:42:21,343 --> 01:42:24,345
Mark, is it nine and a half
or 11 and a half?

1615
01:42:25,722 --> 01:42:27,431
I don't know, Bob.

1616
01:42:28,517 --> 01:42:29,725
You tell me.
