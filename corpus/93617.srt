1122
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,012
DOMlNlC:
lt's all my fault.

1123
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,844
l should have checked to
make sure the door was closed .

1124
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,850
lt could have been worse.

1125
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:56,613
A lot worse.

1126
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:59,451
Man , these kids depend on us.

1127
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:02,356
This is our chance
to be fathers, man .

with my own former four eyes.

1158
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:19,462
Two proud papas.

1159
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:20,468
Daddies, even .

1160
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:21,731
Fathers.

1161
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,432
Hangin' out with their kids.

1162

NO GOOD: l thought you said

00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,257
We are.

1174

At the store?

1175
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:46,017
Look here, man .

1176
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,620
Stop complaining , all right?

1177
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:48,959
XiXi gonna get on my ass

1178
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:51,296
if l don't start pulling
my weight, all right?

1179
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:53,427
NO GOOD: You need a wheelbarrow
to haul all that in .

1180
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,027
G :
Oh , snap!

1181
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:57,198
See, this is what l'm talking
about right here.

1182
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:59,902
This is what l wish
l could get for my son .

1183
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:01,937
Why don't you buy it?

1184
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:05,141
Man , do you know how expensive
it is to raise a child now?

1185
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:07,240
There's diapers.
There's formula.

1186
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:09,615
-Not to mention the toys.
-Wow.

1187
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:12,780
Hell , man , l barely got enough
for the necessities.

1188
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,950
l'm gonna get that, though .
Yeah , l'm gonna get that.

1189
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:19,652
Right.

1190
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:21,196
Diapers. Bottles.

1191
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:23,129
Chips. Cool .

1192
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:25,967
Damn !

1193
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,469
Look, l left my wallet
in the car.

1194
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,334
Hold this spot.
Don't lose it.

1195
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:30,703
-Gotcha.
-All right.

1196
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:32,173
Excuse me, ma'am .

1197
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,911
Oh , hey, how you doin'?

1198
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:40,643
You look just like
Patti LaBelle.

1199
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,412
Without the big hair, though .

1200
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:44,248
When she was with the LaBelles.

1201
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:45,754
Yeah , okay.

1202
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,320
All right, now!
Freeze!

1203
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,557
l want it chilly up in here!

1204
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:58,123
Sir? We don't have
much money in the till .

1205
00:53:58,201 --> 00:53:59,225
You're welcome to it.

1206
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:02,032
But l would recommend that
you rob a convenience store.

1207
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:03,663
Did l ask you for money?

1208
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,900
No, l did not.

1209
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:07,273
Now, give me some
of them snot suckers.

1210
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:09,539
Some of them rattles.
Some ass thermometers.

1211
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:12,104
Pronto.
Yeah . Yeah .

1212
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:15,242
Y'all got some baby grub

1213
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,518
ls the baby teething?

1214
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,820
Oh , and don't forget
the rubber nipples.

1215
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:23,859
Yeah .

1216
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,690
And the booties
for the baby's feet.

1217
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,457
And cotton swabs.

1218
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:28,827
Cotton swabs.

1219
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:31,298
That reminds me.
ls the baby still on formula?

1220
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:34,064
You should really start
going for organic.

1221
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:36,537
Organic.
Right, right, right, right.

1222
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:37,971
What the hell ''organic'' mean?

1223
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:39,531
lt means it's grown naturally

1224
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:42,407
without any harmful pesticides
that might poison your baby.

1225
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:44,743
What?
You trying to poison my kid?

1226
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:45,712
No!

1227
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,911
l want everything organic
up in this bitch !

1228
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:53,717
Right now!

1229

You ain't gonna be the
Brothas Stylz's manager no more.

From your daughter.

Special smoke.

Cure a chronic ailment.

1319
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:55,597
Even a broken heart.

1320
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:56,962
Hmm .

All this time, l thought
you was uptight and shit.

You remind me of myself
when l was your age.

00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:16,175
The Triads.

1325

Met XiXi's moms up at the club.

1332
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,305
Got gander at junk in the trunk.

1333
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:43,342
She made you turn
your life around .

1334
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:46,814
Not before reality bitch-slapped
me in the face first.

1335
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:50,785
Gangster Gung Ho
got cap busted in ass.

Yeah .

1338
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:05,831
After that,
all l could think about

1339
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:09,668
was giving my daughter and
my baby's mama a better life.

1340
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:11,972
Any regrets?

1341
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,030
One.

1342
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,579
l didn't do it sooner.

1343
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,521
Dominic.

Well , this really

01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:40,763
Dominic.

1348
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:42,736
What's she doing here?

1349
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:47,133
You caught us at a bad time.
We just got out of the bath .

1350
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,340
''We''?

1351
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:55,079
Maybe we should talk.

1352
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:10,528
Are you trying to tell me
you're a. . .

1353
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,400
Let's be real .

1354
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:23,843
Jasmine needs
a full-time parent.

1355
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,073
For when she's sick.

1356
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:26,775
For when she can't sleep.

1357
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:28,749
You know you can't
be counted on for that.

1358
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:30,285
No, that's not true.

1359
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,446
That's what l wanted to
talk to you about.

1360
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,252
We have to do
what's best for Jasmine.

1361
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:38,487
And you think her having
two mommies is what's best?

1362
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:39,323
Yes.

1363
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:40,919
Venus and l are in love.

1364
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:43,090
She's with Jasmine
every single day.

1365

01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:21,986
Brandy.

1405
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,132
Carver.

1406
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:36,178
l am sorry.

1407
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:42,776
Wake your sorry asses up!

1408
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:51,620
l ain't gonna say this
but one time.

1409
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:53,457
So you damn well better hear me.

1410
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:55,394
Now, Lonnie.

1411
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:59,093
Don't get caught up in this
''baby's mama'' drama.

1412
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,466
Now, you had you
a good woman in Brandy.

1413
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:03,300
She a good woman .
She likes you .

1414
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:05,533
And that baby likes you , too.

1415
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:07,906
You need to be a man .

1416
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:09,968
You need to go ahead
and pick your hair out

1417
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:13,038
and get rid of them damn
deep-sea-diving goggles

1418
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:15,242
and handle your business.

1419
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:17,752
And you .

1420
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,253
Rerun .

1421
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:20,050
Huh?

1422
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:21,248
Yeah , you .

1423
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:22,757
You got a good woman , too.

1424
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:24,554
But you're too damn lazy.

1425
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:27,152
All you want to do is
lay up on your ass all day.

1426
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:28,993
And you ain't no fighter.

1427
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:32,523
Hell , l'll knock your dick
in the dirt, old as l am .

1428
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:35,264
Yeah , you need to put
your family first.

1429
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:37,898
Put your family first.

1430
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:41,510
And , Dom , you ain't no player.

1431
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:45,877
Now, Uncle Virgil was a player.

1432
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:47,347
You hear me?

1433
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:50,408
l was slammin' more Cadillac
doors and pimpin' more ho's

1434
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:53,512
while you were still swimming
around in your daddy's nut sac.

1435
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:54,749
And you got a good woman , too.

1436
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:59,557
But no, you mad 'cause she done
got herself another woman .

1437
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:02,655
Hell , be Uncle Virgil
back in the day,

1438
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:05,428
l'd have both them chicks
over at my house right now.

1439
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:06,934
Cookin' my breakfast.

1440
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:08,163
Butt-naked .

1441
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:10,171
With the house shoes on .

1442
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,974
Best thing l can suggest to you

1443
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:15,272
is you get yourself
back in your baby's life

1444
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:17,744
as soon as you can .

1445
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:19,610
Don't be like me, Dom .

1446
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:21,741
End up old .

1447
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:23,775
Lonely.

1448
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,918
Living with
your goofy-ass nephew

1449
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:29,719
and his broke-ass friends.

1450
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:35,853
Do l really look like Rerun?

1451
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:37,692
LONNlE :
Brandy!

1452
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,325
MAN :
Slow down , kids.

1453
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:41,529
Brandy!

1454
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:59,551
Brandy, can you find it
in your heart to forgive me?

1455
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:04,885
You know, the loving ,
the caring , the compassionate,

1456
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:10,558
the dashing , the debonair,
the real Lonnie.

1457
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,464
He's back.

1458
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:15,163
And he'd like another chance.

1459
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:18,196
How about dinner tonight?

1460
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:20,299
l'm all ears.

1461
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:22,071
You want some pig feet?

1462
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:24,646
Ooh , is she a cutie pie.

1463
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:25,874
BRAND Y:
Like her mama.

1464
01:06:25,948 --> 01:06:27,939
Yes, indeedy, feed the needy.

1465
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:29,177
Want some ribs?

1466
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:30,275
Some chitlins?

1467
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,380
So, we were
high school sweethearts.

1468
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,186
l thought
he was Prince Charming .

1469
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:38,055
But he turned out to be a toad .

1470
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:40,721
Your ex and my baby's mama
need to get together.

1471
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:42,593
'Cause she's a rat.

1472
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:43,723
A hood rat.

1473
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:44,731
Right.

1474
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,566
You know, l've always had
this idealistic view of family.

1475
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:49,865
House in the burbs.

1476
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:51,429
With the white picket fence.

1477
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:52,940
And a cute puppy, like a. . .

1478
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,943
BOTH :
Chocolate lab.

1479
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:01,805
Oh .

1480
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:04,478
Let me clean those for you .

1481
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:08,389
Hey, are these new glasses?

1482
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:12,791
Yeah , the other ones
are kind of large and square.

1483
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,523
What you waitin' on , dawg?

1484
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:15,825
An engraved invitation?

1485
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:17,263
Huh?

1486
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,233
Kiss her, fool .

1487
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:21,064
Go, Lonnie.
Go.

1488
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:22,502
Go, Lonnie.
Yeah .

1489
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:24,664
l know Ho-landa's my mama.

1490
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,436
But Brandy's all that
and a bag of tits.

1491
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:28,442
He's right, boy.

1492
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:31,969
l mean , check out those
tig old bitties.

1493
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:35,278
l've been sucklin' those
chocolate-milk sacs for months,

1494
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:37,581
and it is nice.

1495
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,144
Lonnie.

1496
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:43,023
Are you feeling okay?

1497
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:46,357
No, l think l had
a little too much wine.

1498
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:49,031
l guess it is getting
a bit late.

1499
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:52,192
Yeah , maybe l should be going .

1500
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,143
That's my daddy.

1501
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:17,753
What the hell is. . .
Open up the door, fool .

1502
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:26,059
What the hell is this, man?

1503
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:27,966
Breakfast, fool .

1504
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:31,634
No, man , l'm talking about what
the hell you do to the room .

1505
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:35,336
My grandmother told me
make myself at home, man .

1506
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,812
Want a grilled-cheese
sandwich , man?

1507
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,914
No, l'm cool .

1508
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:44,646
All right, then .

1509
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:47,956
You still mad at me, man?

1510
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:52,888
Look, Robin Hood .

1511
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:55,925
Because of what you did ,
XiXi ain't speakin' to me.

1512
01:08:55,998 --> 01:08:58,489
l haven't even seen
my baby, man .

1513
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:01,365
That little stunt you pulled
really messed my life up.

1514
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:02,563
What's up with you , man?

1515
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:05,732
You still the same guy that got
''Thug Life'' tatted on his arm?

1516
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,400
Yeah , that's me.

1517
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,570
But l got my son's name
tatted on the other arm now.

1518
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:14,338
We gonna always be boys, man .

1519
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:16,374
We family.

1520
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:18,420
l got a family of my own now.

1521
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,614
So that's my priority.

1522
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:24,686

1523
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,352
l'm proud of you , man .

1524
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:29,158
Thanks, baby.

1525
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,596
Now, you sure you don't want
one of these grilled cheese?

1526
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,397
Yeah , go on
and hook me up one, man .

1527
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,438
All right, then .
lt's organic.

1528
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:50,350
What the hell you doin' bustin'
in here like you pay the bills?

1529
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:53,683
l mean , like you're the police.

1530
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:56,122
Sit your Count Crackula-lookin'
ass down .

1531
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,660
-What?
-And you shut the hell up.

1532
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:00,592
Show me some respect
around here.

1533
01:10:00,663 --> 01:10:03,257
'Cause Lord knows l earned it.

1534
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:04,799
The days of you two bitches

1535
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:08,030
using my baby boy
for a payday are over.

1536
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:09,627
He's coming with me.

1537
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:14,768
And maybe, just maybe,
if you get your shit together,

1538
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:16,572
l might let you see him .

1539
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:17,873
But Princess Ro-Ro --

1540
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:20,381
But Ro-Ho, my ass.

1541
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,007
Be-otch !

1542
01:10:22,084 --> 01:10:25,645
You don't like the way l roll ,
take me to court.

1543
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:30,857
Come on , little Carver.

1544
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:32,826
Let's go home.

1545
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,659
Sorry you had to hear that, man .

1546
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:38,656
Oh , don't worry.

1547
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:43,103
You'll still get
your little $300 a week.

1548
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:46,868
Ain't that what you had him for?

1549
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:51,642
Let's get out of here.

1550
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:57,850
Swoll !

1551
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,319
Mama, no.

1552
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:02,482
And l'm proud to say that many
of Philadelphia's top artists

1553
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:05,186
have recorded right here
in this studio.

1554
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,525
And we have
an award-winning engineering . . .

1555
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,723
Dominic.
What are you doing here?

1556
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:12,096
l just want to tell you
you're right.

1557
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:15,364
Being a parent means
being there every day.

1558
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:17,132
Look, l know
you don't need me, Nia.

1559
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:19,299
But l need Jasmine.

1560
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,570
Things haven't exactly
been going my way lately.

1561
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:23,703
First the Brothas Stylz
fire me.

1562
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:25,337
Then l find out
you're a lesbian .

1563
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:26,813
Wait a minute.
You got fired?

1564
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:28,543
You're a lesbian?

1565
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:36,813
Thank you .

1566
01:11:36,892 --> 01:11:38,291
Thanks.

1567
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:49,662
The other day,
l went to visit you , right?

1568
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:51,365
l saw you and Venus
with Jasmine.

1569
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,635
You guys looked
just like a family, you know.

1570
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:55,734
And it became clear
what's important.

1571
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:58,405
l need to be part
of my daughter's life.

1572
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,711
l want to pack her lunch on
the first day of kindergarten .

1573
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:04,116
l want to put Bactine
on her skinned knee

1574
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:06,552
when she falls off her bike.

1575
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:08,886
l want to keep her away
from players like me.

1576
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:10,219
