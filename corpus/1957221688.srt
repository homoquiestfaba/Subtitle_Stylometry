1
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:22,598
- My father died the day I was born.

2
00:00:23,756 --> 00:00:27,495
I was raised by Fyodor Dostoevsky
and Friedrich Nietzsche.

3
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,595
When I was 12 my mother took
me to a psychic who said

4
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,251
in a past life I was hit in
the head by a movie camera

5
00:00:32,276 --> 00:00:35,491
and I died not knowing my own name.

6
00:00:35,516 --> 00:00:38,791
He said that's why in this
lifetime I'd be allergic to film.

7
00:00:38,816 --> 00:00:41,731
He must've had the wrong guy.

8
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:43,616
I'm a filmmaker.

9
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:28,650
Yeah, Ma.

10
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:31,800
Yeah, hey, I got the care package.

11
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:33,164
Yeah, thanks.

12
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:35,510
I'm taking the vitamins, yeah, yeah.

13
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:38,898
No, I feel a lot better now
since I've been taking them.

14
00:02:38,923 --> 00:02:41,590
I'm working on the script, yeah.

15
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:45,123
Well, I got fired.

16
00:02:46,103 --> 00:02:49,191
You know, well, I mean it's actually good,

17
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,379
because it gives me more
time to work on the script

18
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,910
and to meet people, you know.

19
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:57,695
Yeah, well I am gonna need
help with the rent again.

20
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,181
So do you think you can?

21
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:01,535
Thanks.

22
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,135
Listen, that'll be my
Christmas present, all right?

23
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,251
No no no, don't get me
a Christmas present,

24
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:09,776
just, you know, that'll be it.

25
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:12,278
Okay.

26
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,627
How you doing?

27
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:18,214
You okay, yeah?

28
00:03:24,148 --> 00:03:27,515
Oh, listen, Ma, listen, I gotta go, okay?

29
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,391
All right, I'll call you back later.

30
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,243
Okay.

31
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:31,101
Buh bye.

32
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:33,423
New York, New York.

33
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:36,079
If I could take living there
I could take living anywhere.

34
00:03:36,104 --> 00:03:37,948
Only problem is I'm broke.

35
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,391
It could be worse.

36
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:45,291
I could be a rat in a
laboratory experiment.

37
00:03:45,316 --> 00:03:47,239
And you know, every great
artist had to suffer a little

38
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:49,931
before they got their big break.

39
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,095
And some have had to
suffer their whole lives

40
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,620
and ended up broke and dead
before they got their due.

41
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,139
But hey, I'm not worried.

42
00:04:03,164 --> 00:04:05,659
Someday people are gonna know who I am.

43
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:06,851
Aldolfo Rollo.

44
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:18,499
- 15,

45
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,863
14,

46
00:04:19,888 --> 00:04:21,351
13,

47
00:04:21,376 --> 00:04:22,683
12,

48
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,215
11,

49
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,383
10,

50
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:26,839
nine,

51
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:28,020
eight,

52
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:29,102
seven,

53
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:30,379
six,

54
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:31,355
five,

55
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,188
four,

56
00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:33,319
three,

57
00:04:33,344 --> 00:04:34,800
two,

58
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:35,820
one.

59
00:04:35,845 --> 00:04:38,012
Ready or not, here I come.

60
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:46,225
I thought you were someone.

61
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,041
- No, I...

62
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:52,519
Excuse me.

63
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:55,127
- I thought you were my nephew.

64
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:08,533
Okay, ready?

65
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:12,055
Get set, go!

66
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:15,718
Angelica.

67
00:05:15,743 --> 00:05:18,709
You could be the star of my movie.

68
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:20,567
Such beauty and grace.

69
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:26,294
You turned this whole
coffee shop into a shrine.

70
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,986
Everything in here becomes holy.

71
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:31,899
I could sit here for hours ordering coffee

72
00:05:31,924 --> 00:05:35,174
after sacred coffee from you, Angelica.

73
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:52,145
Hello Angie.

74
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,405
Hi Angie.

75
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,434
Hi.

76
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:55,874
Hey, your hair looks beautiful today.

77
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:56,707
- What's up Angie?

78
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,240
- Thank you.

79
00:05:58,265 --> 00:05:59,564
For you.

80
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:00,999
Thank you.

81
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:03,280
Thank you very much.

82
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:05,209
It's about time
you changed the thing.

83
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:08,302
You're happy to see me.

84
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,282
I know you are because your face brightens

85
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:11,664
when I come around.

86
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:12,939
- You finished?

87
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:16,498
- Yeah, yes I am.

88
00:06:17,993 --> 00:06:20,076
Did you find your nephew?

89
00:06:30,828 --> 00:06:31,971
- Yes, that's it.

90
00:06:31,996 --> 00:06:33,531
That's right, thank you, Mama.

91
00:06:33,556 --> 00:06:34,763
Thank you.

92
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:39,307
Now, how about a song for a
lady who pays her rent on time?

93
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,028
- Yeah, she deserves it.

94
00:06:41,053 --> 00:06:41,928
- High or low?

95
00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:43,069
- I'll take low.

96
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:48,094
<i>♪ You were on time, my friend ♪</i>

97
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:50,679
<i>♪ Bless your heart ♪</i>

98
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:54,348
<i>♪ Till we raise the rent again ♪</i>

99
00:06:56,463 --> 00:06:58,183
<i>♪ You are the one ♪</i>

100
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,715
- Hey, Mr. Hollywood.

101
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,567
- Don't sneak up behind us like that.

102
00:07:01,592 --> 00:07:03,064
Did you like our singing?

103
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,719
- Oh, that was really beautiful,

104
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:07,378
I should put you in a movie or something.

105
00:07:07,403 --> 00:07:09,019
- You're too cute.

106
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:11,524
- You know, before you put
us in a movie, Mr. Hollywood,

107
00:07:11,549 --> 00:07:13,315
you know, where's the rent?

108
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,944
- You know, I called my
mother, she's gonna give me

109
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:16,807
the money, I'll have it for
you by the end of the week.

110
00:07:16,832 --> 00:07:18,595
- The end of the week?
- Yeah, Sunday.

111
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,444
- Sunday?

112
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:21,187
Sunday's no good, you know, all the banks

113
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:22,327
are closed on Sunday.

114
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:23,167
- Oh, well Monday then.

115
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,819
- No, forget about
Monday, that's next week,

116
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,003
I want it this week.

117
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,443
- You have the money Friday.

118
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:28,839
I want the money.

119
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:29,939
Yeah, I want the money.

120
00:07:29,964 --> 00:07:31,114
- By Friday.
- By Friday.

121
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:32,527
- Or I break your fucking skull.

122
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,015
- Or I'll break your fucking skull.

123
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,259
- That's all, like that.

124
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:36,579
- That's that, like that.

125
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:38,995
- Don't tell me, I'm
telling you it's like that.

126
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,315
You have the money Friday...

127
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,903
- Hey, let me, I'll do it...

128
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,313
- No, I'm doing it 'cause you can't.

129
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,763
- I'm doing it, what do
you mean you're doing it?

130
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:46,247
- You wanna work for me you
do it my way, you understand?

131
00:07:46,272 --> 00:07:48,067
- Listen, I'm gonna grow, you understand?

132
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,001
- You're what?

133
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:50,603
- You told me I could grow in this job.

134
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:52,103
- In the garden you'll grow.

135
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:53,472
- Meet you in the garden.

136
00:07:55,472 --> 00:07:56,280
Hey, hey come here.

137
00:07:56,305 --> 00:07:57,891
You know, you put me in this
position, you understand?

138
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:01,403
No, here you are, you put
me in this position, okay?

139
00:08:01,428 --> 00:08:03,247
I want the money Friday.-

140
00:08:03,272 --> 00:08:04,343
- Okay.
- You understand?

141
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:05,176
- Yeah.

142
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:06,553
- And let me tell you something,

143
00:08:06,578 --> 00:08:07,987
can a blind man direct a movie?

144
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:08,887
Huh?
- What?

145
00:08:08,912 --> 00:08:12,162
- Yeah, can a blind man direct a movie?

146
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:15,523
- Come on, come on.

147
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:16,676
Go ahead, get outta here.

148
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:18,207
- Yeah, go ahead.

149
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:21,112
- This movie, is it black
and white or is it in color?

150
00:08:21,137 --> 00:08:22,756
I don't know, I can't see.

151
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:24,771
Yeah, go ahead and laugh.

152
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,271
Enjoy yourselves.

153
00:08:26,296 --> 00:08:27,671
One day you'll see.

154
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:30,652
I'll put you in a script and
it won't be so flattering.

155
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,067
Someday I'll come back in a limousine

156
00:08:32,092 --> 00:08:33,835
to reminisce about my developing years

157
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,052
and they'll have mounted a plaque

158
00:08:35,077 --> 00:08:36,635
on the front of this dingy building

159
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,507
with the words "Aldolfo Rollo lived here."

160
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:42,355
Tour buses will slowly pass by.

161
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,380
Fat German tourists will
shake their heads at the ruin.

162
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:49,876
Maybe there won't even be a
building standing any longer.

163
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:57,008
And the name Bafardi will
be buried under the rubble.

164
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,870
Why am I wasting my breath on you guys?

165
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:03,506
Today I've got a very important meeting

166
00:09:03,531 --> 00:09:06,323
with some big producers.

167
00:09:06,348 --> 00:09:08,265
- You know what we got?

168
00:09:10,013 --> 00:09:13,096
We got a dog that can read your mind.

169
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:22,775
Are you propositioning my wife?

170
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:26,303
- That's his little joke,
but now look what's happened.

171
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:27,759
You're making the kid nervous.

172
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:30,983
Kid, you want a sucker or something?

173
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:33,263
- You know who he reminds me of, though?

174
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:36,371
He looks like a young Don
Knotts, you know Don Knotts?

175
00:09:36,396 --> 00:09:39,799
Incredible Mr. Limpet, Son of Flubber?

176
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:42,139
- What, you mean the guy that blew up?

177
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,855
- What guy blew up?

178
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,430
- Guess who I see.

179
00:09:45,455 --> 00:09:46,899
Who?

180
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:48,563
- Gary Cooper.

181
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,083
I see a young Gary Cooper.

182
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:53,679
- What I tell you, she's
got the eye, right?

183
00:09:53,704 --> 00:09:57,375
Young Gary Cooper, listen,
you wanna make 100 bucks?

184
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,215
We're shooting something this weekend.

185
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,811
You show up at this address.

186
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:03,955
They were
interested in me, all right.

187
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,488
I'm just not sure for what.

188
00:10:08,212 --> 00:10:09,891
Friday was coming and
I was down to nothing,

189
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,166
and 100 bucks is 100 bucks.

190
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:18,415
- Here you go, kids.

191
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,223
Get yourselves some Chinese food.

192
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:25,031
And thanks for adding
some class to our program.

193
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:26,562
Hey, Bubbles, look who's here,

194
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:28,494
it's Gary fuckin' Cooper, huh?

195
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,475
- Oh jeez, what was this
kid's real name, huh?

196
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,991
- Don Knotts, I don't know.

197
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:32,935
- Oh nevermind, nevermind.

198
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,951
Gary!

199
00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:36,251
Gary, we're so happy to have you here,

200
00:10:36,276 --> 00:10:38,787
we've been thinking a
lot about your potential.

201
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:40,979
Make yourself comfortable.

202
00:10:48,677 --> 00:10:49,510
All right.

203
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:55,492
This kid looks so nervous,
like a fish on a hook.

204
00:10:55,517 --> 00:10:57,617
Don't be nervous, kid,
you know we're gonna do?

205
00:10:57,642 --> 00:10:59,274
It's a very pleasant atmosphere,

206
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:00,851
we ask you a couple questions

207
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:02,411
about your movie making career,

208
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:04,672
sometimes a person wants
to change their name

209
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,474
and that's okay by us, right?

210
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,311
- No problem.
- All right.

211
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:09,169
You set?

212
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:12,539
- Yeah, I guess so.

213
00:11:14,316 --> 00:11:16,331
I get $100 for this, right?

214
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:17,980
- Oh, for Christ's sake
kid, after the show.

215
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:19,300
- Show him the money, why don't you,

216
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:21,037
makes him feel better maybe, right?

217
00:11:21,062 --> 00:11:23,395
- Look, $100 after the show, no problem.

218
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,943
- All right, now you ready or
you wanna go to the bathroom

219
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:27,988
or something before we start?

220
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:29,411
No, I'm okay.

221
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:30,680
- Okay.

222
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:32,955
Then take your clothes off.

223
00:11:33,978 --> 00:11:36,228
- You're kidding me, right?

224
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:41,215
- The show's called The Naked Truth, kid.

225
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,031
You can read, right, you're a writer.

226
00:11:43,056 --> 00:11:46,645
The Naked Truth, we ask
people questions au naturale.

227
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,099
- You know, nude.

228
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,883
- In the buff?

229
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:51,759
- Like, butt fuckin' naked,

230
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:54,511
or am I getting a little
too crude for you there?

231
00:11:54,536 --> 00:11:57,169
- Wait, wait a minute, I
didn't know about this.

232
00:11:57,194 --> 00:11:59,259
- What, he doesn't watch the show?

233
00:11:59,284 --> 00:12:01,281
- Look, what the fuck is this, you know?

234
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:02,951
100 bucks for half an hour,

235
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:05,376
you don't wanna do it,
get the fuck outta here.

236
00:12:07,055 --> 00:12:08,690
Nice to meet you, Al,

237
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:10,750
we understand that you're a film director.

238
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:14,275
Are you most interested in romance movies?

239
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,451
All I got was 40 bucks.

240
00:12:19,476 --> 00:12:21,631
It was a take it or leave it kinda thing.

241
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:24,073
I ate three pizzas and puked.

242
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:05,597
What was I gonna do?

243
00:13:05,622 --> 00:13:07,473
I had sold everything.

244
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:09,721
What else could I sell?

245
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:10,660
No.

246
00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:12,909
Not the script, Aldolfo.

247
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:16,351
My script, my chisel, my brush, not that.

248
00:13:17,575 --> 00:13:18,769
Not for money.

249
00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:23,794
<i>♪ Friday's the day, my friend ♪</i>

250
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:29,102
<i>♪ If you don't pay, we're
gonna break your legs ♪</i>

251
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:32,357
I figured it was worth at
least a couple of hundred.

252
00:13:32,382 --> 00:13:34,713
After a week of no
takers, I got a phone call

253
00:13:34,738 --> 00:13:36,781
from a guy named Joe.

254
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:39,088
No last name, just Joe.

255
00:13:39,113 --> 00:13:41,033
I went straight over.

256
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:01,622
- Come in.

257
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:06,722
Aldolfo?

258
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:10,452
- Joe?

259
00:14:10,477 --> 00:14:11,384
- Aldolfo.

260
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:12,633
I love that name.

261
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:14,237
Who gave it to you?

262
00:14:14,262 --> 00:14:15,503
My mother.

263
00:14:17,082 --> 00:14:18,898
- How about that.

264
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:20,657
Your mother.

265
00:14:20,682 --> 00:14:21,993
You're perfect, kid.

266
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:23,057
Sit down.

267
00:14:23,082 --> 00:14:27,386
Oh no, I'm not talking to
you, just get those bets down.

268
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,232
Caught you looking at it.

269
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:44,226
Smashed the fuck out of me in Vietnam.

270
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:48,852
If you believe that,
you'll believe anything.

271
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,863
1000.

272
00:14:55,443 --> 00:14:57,257
For Christ's sakes, I love this kid.

273
00:14:57,282 --> 00:15:00,153
Pick up the money, for crying out loud.

274
00:15:02,224 --> 00:15:03,141
What a face.

275
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,177
Can I kiss that face?

276
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:05,137
Let me kiss it.

277
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:07,293
Dang, get in here, I want
you to give this kid a kiss

278
00:15:07,318 --> 00:15:08,349
right on the face.

279
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:12,827
Oh jeez.

280
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:14,625
- Hi.

281
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,465
- Hi.

282
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,041
- Hi, he says hi to that?

283
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:18,081
He says hi?

284
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:25,525
So you wanna make a movie, right?

285
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,298
- Well I have a script.

286
00:15:29,785 --> 00:15:31,033
- I guess you do.

287
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:32,293
Jesus.

288
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:33,929
I may be outta my mind.

289
00:15:33,954 --> 00:15:36,705
But I wanna be involved.

290
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,445
What I'm saying is,

291
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,441
I wanna be in business with you.

292
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:41,855
In the soup, you know?

293
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,105
Hey, will you cut that shit out?

294
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,929
You're in the presence of an artist.

295
00:15:46,954 --> 00:15:48,301
A creator!

296
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:49,243
- I am art.

297
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:53,473
- What she means

298
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:56,325
is that she loves the art of loving.

299
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,968
There there there.

300
00:15:58,993 --> 00:15:59,983
That's real art.

301
00:16:06,686 --> 00:16:07,519
Aldolfo.

302
00:16:08,515 --> 00:16:10,998
I might have to get back
to you on this movie thing.

303
00:16:11,023 --> 00:16:13,523
But meantime, take that money.

304
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:20,782
- Thanks.

305
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:22,347
- Aldolfo.

306
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:24,542
You need this, right?

307
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,773
I mean you can't make a movie
without a script, right?

308
00:16:26,798 --> 00:16:27,708
- Right.

309
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,200
- Give him a kiss goodbye.

310
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:30,866
Yeah.

311
00:16:32,357 --> 00:16:33,190
Aldolfo!

312
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,150
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

313
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:40,966
- 1000 clamatos.

314
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:47,007
It's gotta be worth a
couple of minutes of film.

315
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:53,879
Hello?

316
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,930
I love that hello!

317
00:16:56,955 --> 00:16:58,534
- Joe, hi.

318
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,338
- So how much do you need for this movie?

319
00:17:01,363 --> 00:17:03,469
- I really haven't made a budget yet.

320
00:17:03,494 --> 00:17:05,658
- What use have I got for a budget?

321
00:17:05,683 --> 00:17:07,878
This is an artistic project, right?

322
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,214
Yeah, right.

323
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:11,802
Right, so we're talking dollars.

324
00:17:11,827 --> 00:17:13,160
- 250,000 maybe?

325
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,082
- No problem, we're covered.

326
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:18,719
Now I want you to meet me at Al Ruben's.

327
00:17:18,744 --> 00:17:20,074
- Now?

328
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,979
I didn't say tomorrow, did I?

329
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:23,822
- Well I mean it's two a.m..

330
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:26,522
- Hey, you got any of
those movies you made?

331
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,964
Bring 'em along, we'll look at 'em later.

332
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,887
- Could it be this guy Joe
was what I was looking for?

333
00:17:46,947 --> 00:17:49,559
On the surface he didn't
look like a producer type.

334
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:52,084
Not for Aldolfo Rollo, anyway.

335
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,642
Joe excused himself and left
me sandwiched between Dang

336
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,667
and Skippy, his hemophiliac brother.

337
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,602
How ya doing?

338
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:33,242
- My brother tells me you're okay.

339
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:35,510
Says you can be trusted.

340
00:18:35,535 --> 00:18:37,618
Blah blah blah blah blah.

341
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:41,099
He wanted to be a priest.

342
00:18:41,124 --> 00:18:43,291
He's got a very big heart.

343
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:46,230
Me, I don't have a heart.

344
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:49,382
You fuck with my brother I'm
gonna rip your eyelids off

345
00:18:49,407 --> 00:18:53,740
and I'm gonna paste 'em on
your asshole, you got it?

346
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:57,189
- You having the sweet breads?

347
00:18:58,107 --> 00:18:59,945
I love this kid.

348
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,220
I trust him, what do you think, Skippy?

349
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:07,109
Don't worry about Skippy.

350
00:19:07,134 --> 00:19:08,759
He's tough to get to know.

351
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:12,059
But once you get to know
him, you never forget him.

352
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,814
That's my mother.

353
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:19,714
Yeah.

354
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:22,682
- She's like the angel and she
scares away the devil guys.

355
00:19:22,707 --> 00:19:23,515
- Yeah.

356
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,754
I get it.

357
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:28,142
- Oh, see here's the part
where she's casting her spell,

358
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,738
and the devil guy gets really
nervous and he runs away.

359
00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:33,841
Oh oh, and here's, okay,
the character goes over,

360
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:36,599
he goes over to the doorway, the guy sees

361
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:39,738
his past and his future
all in the same moment...

362
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,978
- Yeah, I got it, it's good stuff, kid.

363
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:42,836
Yeah.

364
00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:45,438
And I like the black and white, too.

365
00:19:45,463 --> 00:19:47,642
It reminds me of The Honeymooners.

366
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,604
- Or Renoir, early Goddard.

367
00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:51,462
- Yeah.

368
00:19:52,337 --> 00:19:53,299
Why not.

369
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:55,490
- Why doesn't it have any music?

370
00:19:55,515 --> 00:19:57,949
- Well, because I'll only have music

371
00:19:57,974 --> 00:20:00,599
if you see somebody playing an instrument.

372
00:20:00,624 --> 00:20:02,457
- That's it, let's go.

373
00:20:04,544 --> 00:20:06,842
See Skippy, I told you he was an artist.

374
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:08,282
I love that kid.

375
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,099
You got talent, real talent.

376
00:20:10,124 --> 00:20:11,408
- Thank you.

377
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:12,754
- Talent, right Skippy?

378
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,094
- Sure.

379
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,554
- Listen, I gotta get up early tomorrow,

380
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:20,090
starting getting you that 250,000.

381
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:21,959
- I'll drive him home.

382
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:23,699
- I can walk.

383
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,465
- I'll drive.

384
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,323
- Okay.

385
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,107
Thanks.

386
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:32,152
- So I'll be in touch with you.

387
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:34,113
And I loved it, I really did, I loved it.

388
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:36,378
You have to explain it to me sometime,

389
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,478
'cause you're like one of
those budding young things,

390
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,336
you know?

391
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:41,579
- Thanks, Joe.

392
00:20:41,604 --> 00:20:43,997
- Hey, aren't you forgetting something?

393
00:20:44,022 --> 00:20:44,855
- What?

394
00:20:46,303 --> 00:20:48,947
- Don't you wanna give Joe a kiss goodbye?

395
00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:10,361
- I guess if you want, you
can make a left up here,

396
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:13,740
just cut over to First Avenue,
shouldn't be too much traffic

397
00:21:13,765 --> 00:21:15,348
this time of night.

398
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,647
Right here.

399
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,725
This is gonna sound
crazy, I'm a little tired,

400
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,205
but did I say First Avenue in Manhattan?

401
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,428
Yeah, 'cause I know
there's one in New Jersey.

402
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:37,286
- Shut up.

403
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:41,453
I got something I gotta pick up,

404
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:45,183
it'll go a lot faster if
you don't talk so much.

405
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,068
- Oh, all right, well, I guess
when we get to the other side

406
00:21:48,093 --> 00:21:50,364
you can just let me out, I can
take a bus back or something.

407
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:52,205
- What'd I say?

408
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,068
- You gotta pick something up?

409
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:56,185
- I said shut up.

410
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,043
- Right.

411
00:21:58,146 --> 00:22:01,396
- Fucking tunnels make me very nervous.

412
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,114
This guy Skippy
was turning out to be

413
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:07,895
a real jerk-off.

414
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,753
- What?

415
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,262
- Nothing, I didn't say nothing.

416
00:22:16,371 --> 00:22:18,590
What would my poor mother say?

417
00:22:18,615 --> 00:22:20,606
My son's missing.

418
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:24,114
Maybe they would find my
body, maybe they wouldn't.

419
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:25,930
I wondered what would happen
if I jumped out of a car

420
00:22:25,955 --> 00:22:27,547
going 70 miles an hour.

421
00:22:30,254 --> 00:22:31,791
Jeez.

422
00:22:33,856 --> 00:22:35,650
- Are we there yet?

423
00:22:35,675 --> 00:22:36,859
- What's it look like?

424
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:41,902
- I wanna drive, man, let me drive.

425
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,121
Yeah.

426
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:45,054
All right, you hold it, baby.

427
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,567
Yeah.

428
00:22:46,592 --> 00:22:47,592
There we go.

429
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:50,845
Slide over there, kid.

430
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,953
There we go..

431
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:54,863
Ah, the open road.

432
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,762
- That party we were talking about

433
00:22:57,787 --> 00:23:00,014
got caught in a northern part of the state

434
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:03,102
with two finger bones in
his right front pocket.

435
00:23:03,127 --> 00:23:05,919
- Oh, man, that's that cult shit.

436
00:23:05,944 --> 00:23:07,214
It's not for me.

437
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,199
What?

438
00:23:08,224 --> 00:23:09,402
Cannibalism?

439
00:23:09,427 --> 00:23:10,844
- No, cults, man.

440
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:36,331
Oh yeah.

441
00:23:37,194 --> 00:23:39,954
Beautiful, fucking cold.

442
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:41,876
Ah, packing goods.

443
00:23:41,901 --> 00:23:42,818
Man, great.

444
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:48,967
<i>♪ I play my drum for
him, pa rum pa pa pum ♪</i>

445
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:56,097
You guys have no Christmas spirit, man.

446
00:23:56,122 --> 00:23:58,039
You kill it for me too.

447
00:24:43,594 --> 00:24:44,511
- You mind?

448
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:54,465
- Well, I just wanted to tell you,

449
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,740
don't be sad because I'm
gonna put you in my movie.

450
00:25:00,706 --> 00:25:02,673
- Who says I wanna me in a movie?

451
00:25:02,698 --> 00:25:05,015
- Oh, this isn't going
to be just any movie,

452
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,623
it's gonna be good.

453
00:25:12,406 --> 00:25:14,265
- You the writer?

454
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,123
- Yeah.

455
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:20,551
- You ever been on TV?

456
00:25:21,596 --> 00:25:22,429
- No, no.

457
00:25:25,694 --> 00:25:28,593
- Oh, 'cause my nephew,
he said he saw you on TV.

458
00:25:28,618 --> 00:25:29,840
- Really?

459
00:25:29,865 --> 00:25:33,289
I don't know, must've been somebody else.

460
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:34,397
She hates me.

461
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,173
But I love you, Angelica.

462
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,205
One day you'll see.

463
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,974
I'll dedicate my life's work to you.

464
00:25:45,955 --> 00:25:46,788
Angelica.

465
00:25:48,434 --> 00:25:49,267
Angelica.

466
00:25:51,355 --> 00:25:52,188
Angelica.

467
00:26:02,155 --> 00:26:02,989
Joe!

468
00:26:03,014 --> 00:26:04,366
Jesus!

469
00:26:05,338 --> 00:26:07,230
- You're in love with me.

470
00:26:07,255 --> 00:26:09,249
- How did you get in here?

471
00:26:09,274 --> 00:26:10,770
- Who's Angelica?

472
00:26:10,795 --> 00:26:11,795
I'm jealous.

473
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,309
- How did you know where I lived?

474
00:26:16,334 --> 00:26:18,093
- Take it easy, partner.

475
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,073
We're gonna have to
break through some walls

476
00:26:20,098 --> 00:26:22,173
if we're gonna be working together.

477
00:26:22,198 --> 00:26:24,531
No secrets, no locked doors.

478
00:26:25,754 --> 00:26:27,421
Lie down, that's it.

479
00:26:29,598 --> 00:26:32,681
So we're gonna make a motion picture.

480
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:38,847
I've decided I want art to be
an important part of my life.

481
00:26:41,335 --> 00:26:44,945
When I die, I wanna
leave something behind.

482
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,965
- Look, I just got in from
a night with your brother.

483
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,671
- Ah, those guys wanna leave marks.

484
00:26:51,696 --> 00:26:53,285
Anybody can do that.

485
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,373
Just put a hit on a guy, you leave a mark.

486
00:26:56,398 --> 00:26:57,731
I want a legacy.

487
00:26:58,906 --> 00:27:01,385
- I have principles, you know.

488
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,289
- Watch out for those.

489
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:05,345
Principles and women.

490
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,669
They'll get you every time.

491
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:10,461
- All I wanna do is make my movie.

492
00:27:10,486 --> 00:27:12,974
- Why else am I in bed with you?

493
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,349
- No, cut it out!

494
00:27:18,374 --> 00:27:19,925
All right, stop, stop!

495
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:20,845
- Okay, okay.

496
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,953
Tell me the story of our movie again.

497
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:27,425
Tell me, Aldolfo, tell me about it.

498
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,258
- Okay.

499
00:27:28,283 --> 00:27:29,910
- Start at the beginning.

500
00:27:29,935 --> 00:27:33,393
- Cut to medium shot of an intense,

501
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,289
mysterious, dark-haired woman.

502
00:27:36,314 --> 00:27:39,146
She is an angel, literally.

503
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:42,573
And she's watching Alfred as he sleeps.

504
00:27:42,598 --> 00:27:47,598
He feels her presence, her
energy, her massive beauty.

505
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:49,009
You know what I mean?

506
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,149
He just feels it.

507
00:27:50,174 --> 00:27:51,861
She's a big angel.

508
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:53,809
- No, I mean, she's not
literally big, she's just,

509
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:55,581
I mean, she's a regular woman,
I don't want the audience

510
00:27:55,606 --> 00:27:57,093
to know she's an angel at first.

511
00:27:57,118 --> 00:27:59,389
This you learn later, you know?

512
00:27:59,414 --> 00:28:01,205
- Yeah, but you said she's massive.

513
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,369
- No no, her beauty is massive,
it's like she exudes beauty.

514
00:28:04,394 --> 00:28:05,202
You know what I mean?

515
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:07,580
That doesn't mean that she's big.

516
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:09,545
I mean she could be big, I
mean it could be a big woman

517
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:12,273
playing the part, I have
a few ideas, but you know.

518
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:14,253
Okay, so now the ping pong
ball's going back and forth,

519
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:16,549
back and forth, back and forth.

520
00:28:16,574 --> 00:28:18,665
I'm thinking here maybe
we should cut to a closeup

521
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,773
of the ping pong ball.

522
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,229
I don't know, it might be more subtle

523
00:28:22,254 --> 00:28:24,380
if you stay in the wide shot.

524
00:28:24,405 --> 00:28:25,238
Joe.

525
00:28:26,086 --> 00:28:29,613
This is where it all
comes together now, okay?

526
00:28:29,638 --> 00:28:31,110
All right.

527
00:28:31,135 --> 00:28:33,861
So Alfred is keeping score, right?

528
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:36,030
He turns to Nietzsche and he says,

529
00:28:36,055 --> 00:28:38,300
it's your serve, Friedrich.

530
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:41,658
Nietzsche says, indeed, I serve mankind.

531
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:45,529
Suddenly the ping pong
ball explodes, all right?

532
00:28:45,554 --> 00:28:47,721
Dostoevsky says nice shot.

533
00:28:49,258 --> 00:28:50,091
- Aldolfo.

534
00:28:52,616 --> 00:28:54,033
What page you on?

535
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:56,109
- Four.

536
00:28:57,405 --> 00:28:58,529
- Four?

537
00:28:58,554 --> 00:29:00,469
Yeah.

538
00:29:00,494 --> 00:29:03,080
Okay, so now here's where
the angel starts crying,

539
00:29:03,105 --> 00:29:05,029
but it's tears of blood.

540
00:29:05,054 --> 00:29:05,904
- Aldolfo.

541
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:07,095
Huh?

542
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,328
- Shoot me.

543
00:29:10,036 --> 00:29:12,755
'Cause if you read one more line,

544
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,447
I'm gonna shoot you.

545
00:29:18,853 --> 00:29:23,359
Look kid, all I'm saying is
can't you do a simple story?

546
00:29:23,384 --> 00:29:25,008
Like a love story?

547
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:27,228
Something that grabs you by the balls?

548
00:29:27,253 --> 00:29:28,061
- Love story?

549
00:29:28,086 --> 00:29:31,269
I mean that's been done like 1000 times.

550
00:29:31,294 --> 00:29:33,784
- Correct me if I'm wrong,

551
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:36,919
but I love you always sounds fresh to me.

552
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:38,609
Just depends on who's saying it.

553
00:29:38,634 --> 00:29:39,632
- Don't you understand, Joe?

554
00:29:39,657 --> 00:29:43,144
I wanna do something
new, something different.

555
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:45,888
I don't think you're clear
on what you wanna do.

556
00:29:45,913 --> 00:29:49,108
- Something like Renoir, Tarkovsky.

557
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:50,928
- No no, don't pull that shit.

558
00:29:50,953 --> 00:29:52,352
- What shit?

559
00:29:52,377 --> 00:29:54,288
- You know what I'm talking about.

560
00:29:54,313 --> 00:29:58,381
Dropping names of painters
and famous artists.

561
00:29:58,406 --> 00:30:00,528
Look, I've been to rock stars' houses.

562
00:30:00,553 --> 00:30:02,884
They all shit in the same can.

563
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:04,984
Don't look down on people, Aldolfo.

564
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:06,620
It's unartistic.

565
00:30:06,645 --> 00:30:08,480
And if you don't mind my opinion,

566
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:12,004
I think you're insecure, and
nothing comes from insecurity.

567
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:15,029
You want something, you
gotta reach in and grab it.

568
00:30:15,054 --> 00:30:17,137
You can't doubt yourself.

569
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:24,419
Look, all I'm saying, I like
you, I think you're talented,

570
00:30:24,654 --> 00:30:27,079
I wanna make your movie,
you're the artist,

571
00:30:27,104 --> 00:30:29,732
I just wanna understand the goddamn thing.

572
00:30:29,757 --> 00:30:32,129
This shit stinks,
I know this, okay?

573
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:33,964
- Who's that?

574
00:30:33,989 --> 00:30:36,453
- It's my landlords.

575
00:30:36,478 --> 00:30:38,617
- Your landlords talk like that?

576
00:30:41,469 --> 00:30:42,893
- Man, I can't wait to see
the looks on their faces

577
00:30:42,918 --> 00:30:44,212
when I pay the rent.

578
00:30:44,237 --> 00:30:46,392
All over the
world, all over the world.

579
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:47,248
- No no.

580
00:30:47,273 --> 00:30:48,856
Let me handle this.

581
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:54,912
Hey, what's all the noise, fellas?

582
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:56,188
Who the fuck are you?

583
00:30:56,213 --> 00:30:58,620
- Oh, I'm just visiting my nephew Aldolfo.

584
00:30:58,645 --> 00:30:59,453
Yeah?

585
00:30:59,478 --> 00:31:01,870
Well you tell your nephew
Aldolfo he's out on his ass,

586
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:03,884
that's it, ba-bing ba-bang.

587
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:06,272
- Hey, now that's not a
nice way to talk, guys.

588
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:07,860
Come on in.

589
00:31:07,885 --> 00:31:10,968
Come on in, we'll work something out.

590
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:13,262
- What?

591
00:31:16,493 --> 00:31:18,044
Hey Aldolfo, how are ya?

592
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:19,304
- How much he owe you?

593
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:21,369
- Oh, about 1000, probably.

594
00:31:21,394 --> 00:31:22,329
- What do you mean probably?

595
00:31:22,354 --> 00:31:23,162
- What?

596
00:31:23,187 --> 00:31:24,069
- It's 1000 or it's not.

597
00:31:24,094 --> 00:31:25,427
- About 948.60...

598
00:31:26,365 --> 00:31:27,540
- What is this, an auction?

599
00:31:27,565 --> 00:31:29,008
- That's all?

600
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:30,944
What'd you say your name was?

601
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:33,012
- I'm Lewis and this is Frank.

602
00:31:33,037 --> 00:31:34,455
- Bafardi.

603
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,820
- Bafardi.

604
00:31:35,845 --> 00:31:36,874
Brooklyn, right?

605
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:38,248
- Brooklyn, right.

606
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:40,228
- I know a lotta guys from Brooklyn.

607
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:42,540
You know Ray Bernardo?

608
00:31:42,565 --> 00:31:44,024
- You know Guy Lombardo?

609
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:45,284
- Yeah, I like him.

610
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:46,740
- Who's Guy Lombardo?

611
00:31:46,765 --> 00:31:48,088
- He lives on the fifth floor, shh.

612
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:49,193
- Who's this guy?

613
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:53,012
- Listen, you tell Ray,

614
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:55,740
I want the 10,000 he
owes me for the fights,

615
00:31:55,765 --> 00:31:56,968
that son of a bitch.

616
00:31:56,993 --> 00:31:58,160
- What fights?

617
00:31:59,058 --> 00:32:00,612
- Here.

618
00:32:00,637 --> 00:32:02,144
- I tell you what.

619
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:04,108
Wait a minute.

620
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:05,349
It's Christmas, okay?

621
00:32:05,374 --> 00:32:08,024
So why don't we just make
this like a little gift,

622
00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:08,857
how's that?

623
00:32:08,882 --> 00:32:09,690
No no no no.

624
00:32:09,715 --> 00:32:10,523
- No no, I insist.

625
00:32:10,548 --> 00:32:11,460
- You insist, no, I insist.

626
00:32:11,485 --> 00:32:13,244
Leave your hand down.

627
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:14,488
Take it for Christmas.

628
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:15,840
Hi Aldolfo.

629
00:32:15,865 --> 00:32:17,111
How's the heat?

630
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:18,791
Well the furnace broke
down, but other than that,

631
00:32:18,816 --> 00:32:20,564
the heat's been all right, hasn't it?

632
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:21,868
No, it stinks.

633
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:22,980
- It stinks?

634
00:32:23,005 --> 00:32:24,972
Frank, get on the heat,
didn't I tell ya that?

635
00:32:24,997 --> 00:32:25,805
- What?

636
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,780
We just went downstairs, did
you see me open and lower?

637
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:29,624
- Yeah, but go more, more.

638
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:30,457
- You want more?

639
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:31,315
- More!

640
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:35,204
And I got that new toilet
bowl if you want it,

641
00:32:35,229 --> 00:32:37,118
the one with the high back.
- Oh, thanks a lot.

642
00:32:37,143 --> 00:32:38,696
Listen, while you guys are here,

643
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:41,337
I'd like to pay the rent
for the people next door.

644
00:32:41,362 --> 00:32:43,468
- No no no, that's okay, it's Christmas.

645
00:32:43,493 --> 00:32:45,997
- Oh no no, please,
that's okay, I'd like to.

646
00:32:46,022 --> 00:32:48,577
- Oh no no no no, I'll tell ya what.

647
00:32:48,602 --> 00:32:52,352
You know, we gave 'em
a few months extension.

648
00:32:53,225 --> 00:32:54,637
So it's all right.

649
00:32:56,345 --> 00:32:59,548
- Frank, that's very magnanimous of you.

650
00:32:59,573 --> 00:33:01,256
Good night, boys.

651
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:02,198
Explain it.

652
00:33:05,503 --> 00:33:07,856
That's enough with the animals, okay?

653
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:10,752
Let's do something artistic, Aldolfo.

654
00:33:10,777 --> 00:33:12,277
Creative.

655
00:33:12,302 --> 00:33:13,597
I got an idea.

656
00:33:14,465 --> 00:33:15,870
You know when the main
character goes blind?

657
00:33:15,895 --> 00:33:16,703
Yeah?

658
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:17,632
What if we
have just like 20 minutes

659
00:33:17,657 --> 00:33:18,560
of black leader?

660
00:33:18,585 --> 00:33:19,576
20 minutes?

661
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:20,409
Yeah.

662
00:33:20,434 --> 00:33:22,500
What's the audience
gonna do, read it in braille?

663
00:33:22,525 --> 00:33:24,136
All right, forget it.

664
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:26,336
What's with this disguise?

665
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:27,960
- I wanna take you for a ride.

666
00:33:27,985 --> 00:33:29,235
Ho ho ho ho ho!

667
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,900
See that Porsche over there?

668
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:38,336
Nice, huh?

669
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:40,200
- If you like that kinda thing.

670
00:33:40,225 --> 00:33:42,120
- If you like that kinda thing.

671
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,080
You kill me, kid.

672
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:44,476
You know how much that car is worth?

673
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:45,587
- I have no idea.

674
00:33:45,612 --> 00:33:50,217
- 80,000 bucks, and 60,000
of it's in the engine.

675
00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:53,001
The challenging thing
is it belongs to a cop.

676
00:33:55,932 --> 00:33:59,156
- Well you're not thinking
of stealing it, are you?

677
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:03,780
- You don't think he earned
it on his salary, do ya?

678
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:04,676
Watch.

679
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:06,201
- Hey Joe, what...

680
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:09,803
Shit.

681
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:15,752
- Santa Claus!

682
00:34:15,777 --> 00:34:17,097
- How you doing, kid?

683
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:19,007
- What are you doing with my daddy's car?

684
00:34:19,032 --> 00:34:21,717
- Oh, I'm gonna take it back
to my parts repair place

685
00:34:21,742 --> 00:34:23,176
at the North Pole.

686
00:34:23,201 --> 00:34:24,496
- How you gonna get there?

687
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,552
- Well, I'll probably
start it and just drive it.

688
00:34:26,577 --> 00:34:27,420
- Are you nuts?

689
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:28,500
- Hey, how you doing?

690
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:29,552
Here's my helper.

691
00:34:29,577 --> 00:34:31,200
Marvin the Elf, say hello.

692
00:34:31,225 --> 00:34:33,134
Come on, get in, Marvin.
- Hey! My Porsche!

693
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:39,493
- Get in there before it, god dammit.

694
00:34:39,518 --> 00:34:41,061
- Jesus!

695
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,376
You're fuckin' crazy!

696
00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:44,605
- You're fuckin' right I am!

697
00:34:45,612 --> 00:34:48,828
But, you strip this
down, and in 20 minutes

698
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,572
you got enough money to buy a lot of film.

699
00:34:51,597 --> 00:34:53,160
- Let me out of the car.

700
00:34:53,185 --> 00:34:53,993
- What?

701
00:34:54,018 --> 00:34:55,592
- Let me out of the fuckin' car now, Joe.

702
00:34:55,617 --> 00:34:56,792
- What is it with you?

703
00:34:56,817 --> 00:34:58,607
For Christ's sakes, I'm busting my ass

704
00:34:58,632 --> 00:35:01,052
to get you the money to buy
film to make your movie,

705
00:35:01,077 --> 00:35:03,211
and all you can think of is yourself?

706
00:35:03,236 --> 00:35:05,176
- Yeah, myself, right, myself.

707
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:06,356
Would you pull over, man?

708
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:07,189
Let me out!

709
00:35:07,214 --> 00:35:08,280
- Oh, okay, fine, here, get out.

710
00:35:08,305 --> 00:35:09,807
Goodbye.

711
00:35:09,832 --> 00:35:10,956
See you, Aldolfo.

712
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:11,812
- Open the door.

713
00:35:11,837 --> 00:35:14,556
- Just open the door, get out.

714
00:35:14,581 --> 00:35:15,929
Tootaloo.

715
00:35:47,118 --> 00:35:50,477
You make me crazy like hell!

716
00:35:50,502 --> 00:35:51,745
Shut up!

717
00:36:04,097 --> 00:36:04,905
Hello?

718
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:05,738
- Yes?

719
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:09,180
- Yes, I am Gregoire, I am your neighbor.

720
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,665
May I pass by your fire escape?

721
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,357
I have lost my keys.

722
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:22,621
- I'm sorry...

723
00:36:22,646 --> 00:36:26,380
- Yes, I am Gregoire, I am your neighbor.

724
00:36:26,405 --> 00:36:28,822
I live in the place next door?

725
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:32,487
May I pass by your fire escape?

726
00:36:33,497 --> 00:36:35,092
- You wanna what on my fire escape?

727
00:36:35,117 --> 00:36:37,508
- Pass by, pass by, go.

728
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:38,572
Oh, go.

729
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:39,430
- Merci.

730
00:36:45,265 --> 00:36:46,098
Merci.

731
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:54,534
Please.

732
00:37:17,429 --> 00:37:18,262
It appears

733
00:37:20,068 --> 00:37:21,818
the window is locked.

734
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:23,716
Sorry.

735
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,574
- Eh.

736
00:37:29,729 --> 00:37:30,562
Merci.

737
00:37:50,363 --> 00:37:51,280
- You okay?

738
00:37:58,935 --> 00:37:59,768
- My wife.

739
00:38:01,982 --> 00:38:02,982
She eats me.

740
00:38:06,391 --> 00:38:07,308
- She what?

741
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,370
- She eats me!

742
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,954
Eats me!

743
00:38:13,979 --> 00:38:16,386
Eats me, eats, eats me.

744
00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:17,219
- Oh, hits you.

745
00:38:17,244 --> 00:38:18,290
- Yes, she's violent!

746
00:38:18,315 --> 00:38:20,210
Violent, terrible!

747
00:38:20,235 --> 00:38:21,043
- Angelica?

748
00:38:21,068 --> 00:38:21,876
Yes!

749
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:23,151
- Is your wife?

750
00:38:28,493 --> 00:38:30,160
- She seems so sweet.

751
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:34,159
- Oh yes, she seems so sweet
to everyone else, you see.

752
00:38:34,184 --> 00:38:35,851
She is so beautiful.

753
00:38:36,723 --> 00:38:37,556
- Yes.

754
00:38:44,985 --> 00:38:47,735
- You think my wife is beautiful?

755
00:38:52,693 --> 00:38:53,943
You can say it.

756
00:39:00,651 --> 00:39:03,143
- You're a lucky guy.

757
00:39:05,493 --> 00:39:06,826
- I am so alone!

758
00:39:22,302 --> 00:39:23,719
Can I sleep here?

759
00:39:25,722 --> 00:39:26,555
- Here?

760
00:39:28,346 --> 00:39:29,596
- On the floor.

761
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:21,312
Allow me.

762
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:23,254
Thank you.

763
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:30,861
- You know, last night, it was okay.

764
00:40:32,006 --> 00:40:34,212
I let him stay with me.

765
00:40:34,237 --> 00:40:36,972
I just thought you should know.

766
00:40:36,997 --> 00:40:37,830
- Who?

767
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:40,571
Who?

768
00:40:42,021 --> 00:40:44,412
- He said he was your husband.

769
00:40:44,437 --> 00:40:46,398
- He told you that?

770
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:50,896
If I was you, I'd stay away from him.

771
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:10,354
- Son of a whore, I told
you to stay away from me.

772
00:41:10,379 --> 00:41:11,962
- She forgot these.

773
00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:33,304
- Find out who did this
in the hallway here.

774
00:41:36,509 --> 00:41:37,342
Aldolfo?

775
00:41:38,473 --> 00:41:39,332
- Yeah.

776
00:41:39,357 --> 00:41:40,576
Yeah, Lewis, hi.

777
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:41,536
How's the heat?

778
00:41:41,561 --> 00:41:42,964
- Oh, it's good.

779
00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:44,988
- All right, listen, send
your regards to you know,

780
00:41:45,013 --> 00:41:47,464
your uncle and the family, all right?

781
00:41:47,489 --> 00:41:48,724
Okay.

782
00:41:48,749 --> 00:41:49,749
- All right.

783
00:41:53,593 --> 00:41:58,057
Hey, you're wasting your time,
there's nobody home there.

784
00:42:27,705 --> 00:42:32,705
<i>♪ Am I blue without you ♪</i>

785
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:35,392
<i>♪ Aldolfo, it's true ♪</i>

786
00:42:35,417 --> 00:42:37,476
- Christ, how the fuck do
you keep getting in here?

787
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:38,976
<i>♪ I'm so blue ♪</i>

788
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:41,496
I changed the lock on the
door, for Christ's sakes.

789
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:43,868
- Hey, when I was a kid
they called me Spiderman,

790
00:42:43,893 --> 00:42:46,997
'cause I could climb all over
the backs of these tenements.

791
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,866
Weaving my web from window to window.

792
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:55,173
- I put fucking gates up,
how did you get in here?

793
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,169
- I'm magic, kid.

794
00:42:57,194 --> 00:42:58,906
What do you want from me?

795
00:42:58,931 --> 00:43:01,819
- What do I want from you?

796
00:43:01,844 --> 00:43:04,457
How about a little imagination?

797
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:06,093
- Look Joe, I don't have anything, okay?

798
00:43:06,118 --> 00:43:08,785
If I did I would give it to you.

799
00:43:11,082 --> 00:43:12,082
What's this?

800
00:43:15,749 --> 00:43:17,266
- Your cut of the money.

801
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:20,297
10% of 40,000, it's 4000, right?

802
00:43:20,322 --> 00:43:21,155
Count it.

803
00:43:23,077 --> 00:43:24,693
- I can't take this.

804
00:43:24,718 --> 00:43:26,581
- Look, all I'm saying, for Christ's sake,

805
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:29,821
and you're not making it
very easy for me to say it.

806
00:43:29,846 --> 00:43:31,179
I can trust you.

807
00:43:32,906 --> 00:43:34,609
You know what that means, trust?

808
00:43:34,634 --> 00:43:36,001
'Cause I look around me and I don't see

809
00:43:36,026 --> 00:43:38,026
anyone else I can trust.

810
00:43:40,094 --> 00:43:42,977
To be perfectly honest with you, kid,

811
00:43:43,002 --> 00:43:44,335
you need me too.

812
00:43:45,854 --> 00:43:48,737
Now if you're ready,
let's go to work, huh?

813
00:43:48,762 --> 00:43:50,373
- What work?

814
00:43:50,398 --> 00:43:52,306
- I can't explain it, I just gotta do it.

815
00:43:52,331 --> 00:43:54,797
- I'm not committing any more crimes.

816
00:43:54,822 --> 00:43:56,657
- Suit yourself.

817
00:43:56,682 --> 00:43:57,647
- No more trouble.

818
00:43:57,672 --> 00:43:58,606
Come on, let's go.

819
00:43:58,631 --> 00:44:00,933
- No, no more trouble,
you gotta promise me.

820
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:04,188
If he's a friend of yours, then
how come you're breaking in?

821
00:44:04,213 --> 00:44:06,241
- I can't ring the bell,
for Christ's sakes,

822
00:44:06,266 --> 00:44:08,183
his wife hates my guts.

823
00:44:09,971 --> 00:44:10,804
Follow me.

824
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:15,677
- Joe, come on, this is
breaking and entering!

825
00:44:15,702 --> 00:44:16,981
I wanna go, come on.

826
00:44:17,006 --> 00:44:18,541
- You can't.

827
00:44:18,566 --> 00:44:21,132
You don't know how to bypass the alarm.

828
00:44:23,414 --> 00:44:24,247
- Fuck.

829
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:37,773
Come on, let's go.

830
00:44:37,798 --> 00:44:38,631
- Shh.

831
00:44:52,738 --> 00:44:56,518
- Joe, I mean it, I can't take it anymore!

832
00:44:56,543 --> 00:44:58,940
Please Joe, I can't take it anymore.

833
00:44:58,965 --> 00:45:00,844
My mother would die if I got
arrested, would you please...

834
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:02,028
- Shut up.

835
00:45:02,053 --> 00:45:04,836
Get in there and sit down.

836
00:45:04,861 --> 00:45:07,278
I'm not leaving empty-handed.

837
00:45:23,983 --> 00:45:26,066
- I didn't get your name.

838
00:45:27,798 --> 00:45:29,682
My name?

839
00:45:29,707 --> 00:45:34,540
- I don't know why, but I'm
always happy to see that face.

840
00:45:43,227 --> 00:45:44,060
I...

841
00:45:48,026 --> 00:45:50,193
What is it you do exactly?

842
00:45:53,996 --> 00:45:55,829
- I wanna make a film.

843
00:45:56,803 --> 00:45:57,636
- Really?

844
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:03,106
- That's a big thing
to wanna do, you know?

845
00:46:03,131 --> 00:46:03,964
Me, I...

846
00:46:07,509 --> 00:46:11,426
I'd love to make love to
my wife one more time.

847
00:46:15,018 --> 00:46:19,571
Lose control, sloppy sex,
that's what I want, you know?

848
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:31,289
- Well why don't you do it?

849
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:34,402
- She's not around.

850
00:46:35,803 --> 00:46:37,803
She died a while ago, I,

851
00:46:39,332 --> 00:46:42,018
I don't know where I am, I
still don't know where I am,

852
00:46:42,043 --> 00:46:45,126
I don't know what's going on with me.

853
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,842
I miss her so much I can't even,

854
00:46:48,867 --> 00:46:51,154
I don't even know what
I'm doing, you know?

855
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:52,429
But she's, I...

856
00:46:55,496 --> 00:46:56,304
- It's okay.

857
00:46:56,329 --> 00:47:00,646
- I fucked around, I did all
kinds of things, you know,

858
00:47:00,671 --> 00:47:02,504
other women, you know?

859
00:47:07,989 --> 00:47:10,578
Broke her heart, broke her heart,

860
00:47:10,603 --> 00:47:12,792
and a women's heart is broke,

861
00:47:12,817 --> 00:47:16,158
she's gonna break something
back, you understand me?

862
00:47:16,183 --> 00:47:18,062
I mean, you understand?

863
00:47:18,087 --> 00:47:20,046
- Yeah, sure, yeah.

864
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:22,581
- I mean, maybe you'll
fuck the whole thing up too

865
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:23,849
yourself, you know.

866
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:25,471
I mean, I don't know why we gotta do it,

867
00:47:25,496 --> 00:47:26,671
but we do it, you know?

868
00:47:26,696 --> 00:47:27,847
You understand me?

869
00:47:27,872 --> 00:47:29,342
- Yeah.

870
00:47:29,367 --> 00:47:30,878
- All right.

871
00:47:30,903 --> 00:47:32,070
I can't sleep,

872
00:47:34,891 --> 00:47:36,391
I think I'm dying.

873
00:47:37,361 --> 00:47:38,852
I'm dying.

874
00:47:43,387 --> 00:47:45,259
- Well I bet you had your fun, right?

875
00:47:45,284 --> 00:47:47,117
Oh sure I did.

876
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:49,873
- What are you doing up?

877
00:47:49,898 --> 00:47:51,628
I couldn't sleep.

878
00:47:51,653 --> 00:47:52,486
- You too?

879
00:47:53,753 --> 00:47:54,586
- Yeah.

880
00:47:55,479 --> 00:47:56,340
- Oh.

881
00:47:56,365 --> 00:47:57,508
Look, I gotta go.

882
00:47:57,533 --> 00:47:58,876
Yeah, we gotta go.

883
00:47:58,901 --> 00:47:59,893
- You gotta go?

884
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:00,975
- Yeah.

885
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,818
- You gotta go, you gotta go.

886
00:48:03,843 --> 00:48:04,676
Ooh.

887
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:06,503
Yeah.

888
00:48:08,078 --> 00:48:10,578
I don't think I got your name.

889
00:48:11,529 --> 00:48:12,544
Herman.

890
00:48:12,569 --> 00:48:13,652
- Oh, Herman.

891
00:48:14,905 --> 00:48:16,322
You and my son...

892
00:48:17,872 --> 00:48:18,705
- Aldolfo.

893
00:48:30,142 --> 00:48:32,189
I was in way over my head,

894
00:48:32,214 --> 00:48:35,366
and Joe was pulling me
in deeper and deeper.

895
00:48:35,391 --> 00:48:37,346
Something was happening to me.

896
00:48:37,371 --> 00:48:39,673
Something I couldn't exactly explain.

897
00:48:39,698 --> 00:48:41,321
I didn't know whether
to relax and enjoy it

898
00:48:41,346 --> 00:48:43,679
or be scared out of my mind.

899
00:48:47,896 --> 00:48:49,093
- Hey.

900
00:48:49,118 --> 00:48:50,118
Coffee time.

901
00:48:53,814 --> 00:48:56,209
It's wonderful watching you sleep.

902
00:48:58,674 --> 00:49:00,007
- What happened?

903
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:03,569
- Don't say you don't remember.

904
00:49:03,594 --> 00:49:05,174
It was magic, Aldolfo.

905
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:06,032
Magic.

906
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:17,197
That's my kid.

907
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:20,117
That's your kid?

908
00:49:20,142 --> 00:49:21,197
Yep.

909
00:49:21,222 --> 00:49:22,274
Really?

910
00:49:22,299 --> 00:49:23,107
- Yeah.

911
00:49:23,132 --> 00:49:23,940
- No.

912
00:49:23,965 --> 00:49:24,965
- Yes it is.

913
00:49:25,974 --> 00:49:29,326
- Why don't you go say hi to him?

914
00:49:29,351 --> 00:49:30,184
- I can't.

915
00:49:31,842 --> 00:49:35,009
His mother's got a court injunction.

916
00:49:35,034 --> 00:49:37,451
I can't go anywhere near him.

917
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:41,549
So you just watch him like this?

918
00:49:41,574 --> 00:49:42,574
- Sometimes.

919
00:49:57,409 --> 00:49:58,976
Joe said before you make films,

920
00:49:59,001 --> 00:50:01,964
you gotta make money, so we
went from one scam to the next.

921
00:50:01,989 --> 00:50:04,094
I always knew there was more to a movie

922
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:06,134
than just making money,
but I was beginning to see

923
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:09,851
there was more to money
than just making movies.

924
00:50:09,876 --> 00:50:11,925
I'd never seen so much money.

925
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:16,950
Money to buy things, like
flowers, fancy dinners, $100 tips.

926
00:50:19,086 --> 00:50:21,765
We weren't saving it, we were blowing it.

927
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:24,257
Joe said not to worry
because when you spend money

928
00:50:24,282 --> 00:50:25,861
it comes back to you twofold,

929
00:50:25,886 --> 00:50:30,719
and that soon we'd have enough
money to double the budget.

930
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:40,690
Joe was part of my life now.

931
00:50:40,715 --> 00:50:43,381
I even took him up to
visit my mom for Christmas.

932
00:50:43,406 --> 00:50:45,794
They got along so well he
promised to take her to Honolulu

933
00:50:45,819 --> 00:50:47,085
when the film wrapped.

934
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,777
Joe loved the beach.

935
00:50:58,928 --> 00:51:00,163
Joe was getting more and more excited

936
00:51:00,188 --> 00:51:02,187
about the film every day.

937
00:51:02,212 --> 00:51:04,695
He suggested I make copies of the script.

938
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,720
452 pages, halfway to War and Peace.

939
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:10,995
300 leather bound copies
for the cast and crew

940
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,819
of the film Unconditional Surrender.

941
00:51:14,844 --> 00:51:18,292
But instead of making my
movie I was living in his.

942
00:51:18,317 --> 00:51:22,984
Although I had to admit, I
liked the taste of champagne.

943
00:51:40,622 --> 00:51:41,455
Hello.

944
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:44,585
Hello?

945
00:51:45,933 --> 00:51:46,766
Joe?

946
00:51:48,646 --> 00:51:51,173
Come on, is that you, asshole?

947
00:51:51,198 --> 00:51:52,031
- Martin.

948
00:51:53,316 --> 00:51:54,830
Blah blah blah blah blah.

949
00:51:54,855 --> 00:51:55,885
- Skippy?

950
00:52:19,288 --> 00:52:21,277
Hello?

951
00:52:21,302 --> 00:52:23,437
Oh, hi.

952
00:52:23,462 --> 00:52:25,070
Will you open the door, please?

953
00:52:25,095 --> 00:52:25,928
- Yeah.

954
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:29,100
Could you give me a minute?

955
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,624
Hi.

956
00:52:46,649 --> 00:52:47,655
- Could I use your window?

957
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,144
I got locked out.

958
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:51,086
- Oh, sure, come on in.

959
00:52:56,529 --> 00:52:57,446
- You okay?

960
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:00,864
- Yeah.

961
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:02,800
- 'Cause you look sick.

962
00:53:02,825 --> 00:53:06,356
- Oh, no, I've just been
working a lot lately.

963
00:53:06,381 --> 00:53:08,869
- What, selling drugs?

964
00:53:11,509 --> 00:53:13,176
- That's a good one.

965
00:53:14,917 --> 00:53:16,212
- Can you open the window?

966
00:53:16,237 --> 00:53:17,320
- Yeah, sure.

967
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:27,159
I think it's frozen shut here.

968
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:30,790
- Who's this?

969
00:53:33,307 --> 00:53:35,890
- Oh, that's Anna, Anna Manani,

970
00:53:36,891 --> 00:53:40,014
she's one of my favorite actresses.

971
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:42,626
- It looks like she got a headache.

972
00:53:42,651 --> 00:53:45,759
- Well, that's her intensity, she was,

973
00:53:45,784 --> 00:53:49,451
actually, you remind
me of her a little bit.

974
00:53:57,755 --> 00:54:00,339
If you have a few minutes,
I wouldn't mind showing you

975
00:54:00,364 --> 00:54:04,791
my script, if you wanna
take a look at that part.

976
00:54:07,267 --> 00:54:10,934
I think I'm gonna have
to get a screwdriver.

977
00:54:12,439 --> 00:54:15,670
I was gonna return that,
sorry, he left it here

978
00:54:15,695 --> 00:54:16,750
the night he spent...

979
00:54:16,775 --> 00:54:19,551
- You see him, you tell
him he owes me $3000!

980
00:54:20,451 --> 00:54:21,730
- Really, I don't even know him.

981
00:54:21,755 --> 00:54:23,499
- Yeah, and he can take
that bullshit green card

982
00:54:23,524 --> 00:54:27,880
and shove it so far up his nose,
he gotta get a diaper baby!

983
00:54:27,905 --> 00:54:28,988
- Green card?

984
00:54:30,019 --> 00:54:31,570
You married him for papers?

985
00:54:31,595 --> 00:54:32,512
- Yeah, so?

986
00:54:35,487 --> 00:54:36,584
- He's French.

987
00:54:36,609 --> 00:54:38,514
- I made a mistake, my
English wasn't so good,

988
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:40,374
I couldn't tell.

989
00:54:40,399 --> 00:54:42,099
I'm stupid, is that a crime?

990
00:54:42,124 --> 00:54:43,554
- No no no, you're not stupid at all.

991
00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:46,800
Hey, bilingualism, that's a good thing.

992
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,148
- That bastard took my money for papers,

993
00:54:48,173 --> 00:54:49,883
I never even got them,
and then he had the nerve

994
00:54:49,908 --> 00:54:54,325
to want to sleep with me,
can you believe that shit?!

995
00:54:59,848 --> 00:55:01,439
It's no good, forget about it.

996
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,272
What?

997
00:55:02,297 --> 00:55:05,370
- The shoe, I threw the other one out.

998
00:55:05,395 --> 00:55:06,228
- Oh.

999
00:55:07,514 --> 00:55:10,243
Listen, can I make you a cup of tea?

1000
00:55:10,268 --> 00:55:12,991
I'd really like to talk to you.

1001
00:55:13,016 --> 00:55:14,149
- Look, it's been nice talking to you,

1002
00:55:14,174 --> 00:55:18,399
but I gotta get up tomorrow
morning and go to work.

1003
00:55:18,424 --> 00:55:19,693
- Listen, I don't think that window's

1004
00:55:19,718 --> 00:55:22,291
gonna open till spring.

1005
00:55:22,316 --> 00:55:23,399
There you go.

1006
00:55:28,129 --> 00:55:30,712
You know, if you did the movie,

1007
00:55:32,544 --> 00:55:35,491
you wouldn't have to work
as a waitress anymore.

1008
00:55:35,516 --> 00:55:37,589
- Look, I got an uncle
and three kids to feed,

1009
00:55:37,614 --> 00:55:39,779
so why don't you just close the window

1010
00:55:39,804 --> 00:55:41,637
before you catch cold.

1011
00:55:46,148 --> 00:55:47,263
What's your name?

1012
00:55:47,288 --> 00:55:48,121
- Aldolfo.

1013
00:55:49,436 --> 00:55:51,435
- Thank you, Aldolfo.

1014
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,877
- You're welcome.

1015
00:56:19,189 --> 00:56:21,272
- Did you sit on his lap?

1016
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:35,656
- You okay?

1017
00:57:35,681 --> 00:57:36,656
What are you doing?

1018
00:57:37,891 --> 00:57:38,724
Huh?

1019
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:40,564
What?

1020
00:57:40,589 --> 00:57:42,230
Hey hey hey, kid, come on...

1021
00:57:42,255 --> 00:57:43,272
- Stop, get off of him.

1022
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,915
- Who's gonna clean up all this mess?

1023
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,320
You think I'm gonna clean it up?!

1024
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,351
What, you laughing at me?

1025
00:57:55,376 --> 00:57:56,823
Don't you start laughing at me.

1026
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,480
I said to come over here right now!

1027
00:58:04,392 --> 00:58:06,135
What are you doing here?

1028
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,875
Sorry, I heard

1029
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,751
loud noises in here, I just thought

1030
00:58:09,776 --> 00:58:10,651
something was wrong, sorry.

1031
00:58:10,676 --> 00:58:12,483
- Yeah, well guess what, it's okay.

1032
00:58:12,508 --> 00:58:14,340
It's okay.

1033
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:15,507
- All right.

1034
00:58:15,532 --> 00:58:17,591
Everything okay?

1035
00:58:17,616 --> 00:58:18,449
All right.

1036
00:58:20,976 --> 00:58:23,300
- What's the matter?

1037
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:27,876
He doesn't want you to leave.

1038
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,015
He thinks you're the flower man.

1039
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,724
He watches you through the door

1040
00:58:35,749 --> 00:58:37,631
and he's got this idea that you're the guy

1041
00:58:37,656 --> 00:58:39,656
that brings the flowers.

1042
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:42,663
And I'm allergic to them.

1043
00:58:43,791 --> 00:58:45,475
- Allergic.

1044
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,912
- Will you stop that?

1045
00:58:48,724 --> 00:58:49,959
- I do bring the flowers.

1046
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,567
I mean I send them.

1047
00:58:52,536 --> 00:58:54,516
- And why would you do that?

1048
00:58:56,644 --> 00:58:59,811
- Because you're the star of my movie.

1049
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:04,310
- That's a little sick, right?

1050
00:59:05,569 --> 00:59:06,431
Paulie.

1051
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:07,364
- No, listen.

1052
00:59:08,385 --> 00:59:09,944
I can't believe this, I came in here

1053
00:59:09,969 --> 00:59:11,700
and there were feathers flying all around,

1054
00:59:11,725 --> 00:59:13,604
and then you came in like an angel,

1055
00:59:13,629 --> 00:59:16,336
and that's what I want you to
play in the movie, an angel.

1056
00:59:16,361 --> 00:59:17,774
It's just perfect.

1057
00:59:17,799 --> 00:59:19,882
I mean, you're a natural.

1058
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:21,821
Look.

1059
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:26,640
An angel, you're perfect, I'm telling you.

1060
00:59:26,665 --> 00:59:31,380
You know, you're just an
angel, you're an angel.

1061
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:32,968
- You're crazy.

1062
00:59:32,993 --> 00:59:34,599
You're completely crazy.

1063
00:59:35,545 --> 00:59:38,848
You're funny, I think you're funny.

1064
00:59:38,873 --> 00:59:40,123
- You're funny.

1065
00:59:41,005 --> 00:59:42,505
You're very funny.

1066
00:59:44,066 --> 00:59:44,899
- Hey.

1067
00:59:46,491 --> 00:59:47,383
That's nice.

1068
00:59:47,408 --> 00:59:48,409
Nice.

1069
00:59:48,434 --> 00:59:50,601
He likes you.

1070
01:00:52,997 --> 01:00:54,039
- What are you doing, Aldolfo?

1071
01:00:54,064 --> 01:00:55,015
You're making me nervous.

1072
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:55,975
Will you sit down?

1073
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,795
Eat your steak, it's getting cold.

1074
01:00:58,820 --> 01:00:59,653
- I can't.

1075
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:01,832
- Why not?

1076
01:01:01,857 --> 01:01:03,094
It's a good piece of meat.

1077
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:04,793
What's the matter?

1078
01:01:04,818 --> 01:01:06,267
- Nothing's the matter.

1079
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:08,209
- Nothing's the matter?

1080
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,543
Why you acting like this, then?

1081
01:01:11,568 --> 01:01:13,567
Well,

1082
01:01:13,592 --> 01:01:15,759
because, I just don't
see us making any film.

1083
01:01:15,784 --> 01:01:19,032
We keep talking about it, we
keep spending a lot of money.

1084
01:01:19,057 --> 01:01:21,999
I mean I appreciate everything
you've been doing for me,

1085
01:01:22,024 --> 01:01:24,907
but I just don't see how this
all connects to making a film.

1086
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:27,124
- Aldolfo, what did I say?

1087
01:01:27,149 --> 01:01:30,592
What we're working on here is a bond.

1088
01:01:30,617 --> 01:01:31,450
A trust.

1089
01:01:32,597 --> 01:01:35,647
The foundation of all great
creation, you understand?

1090
01:01:35,672 --> 01:01:40,613
Bond, trust, foundation, that's
how you pull off Hitchcock.

1091
01:01:40,638 --> 01:01:42,412
Will you shut the fuck up?

1092
01:01:42,437 --> 01:01:43,867
We're tying to work in here.

1093
01:01:43,892 --> 01:01:45,232
- Come on, what are you doing?

1094
01:01:45,257 --> 01:01:48,007
- Don't you think they're
being inconsiderate, Aldolfo?

1095
01:01:48,032 --> 01:01:50,704
- I know those people, you
don't have to bang on the wall.

1096
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,733
- Oh.

1097
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:01,220
Aha, so that's Angelica.

1098
01:02:02,896 --> 01:02:04,996
You sure know to pick 'em,
kid, she's a real beauty.

1099
01:02:05,903 --> 01:02:07,159
- Not so loud, Joe.

1100
01:02:07,184 --> 01:02:09,051
- You mean you haven't
even talked to her yet?

1101
01:02:09,076 --> 01:02:10,023
- I talk to her.

1102
01:02:10,048 --> 01:02:11,523
- Well then let's invite her to dinner.

1103
01:02:11,548 --> 01:02:12,468
- No no no, don't...

1104
01:02:12,493 --> 01:02:13,303
- Yeah yeah.

1105
01:02:13,328 --> 01:02:14,495
Angelica, hey.

1106
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:28,425
- Fuck.

1107
01:02:29,685 --> 01:02:31,768
Don't give out on me now.

1108
01:02:33,091 --> 01:02:33,924
- What?

1109
01:02:36,154 --> 01:02:36,987
- No!

1110
01:02:40,094 --> 01:02:40,927
Oh!

1111
01:02:42,172 --> 01:02:45,058
- No, Angelica, forget
him, he's an alcoholic.

1112
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:46,603
Get over here.

1113
01:02:46,628 --> 01:02:47,795
Get over here.

1114
01:02:50,054 --> 01:02:50,887
Mine now!

1115
01:02:51,808 --> 01:02:52,641
Forever!

1116
01:02:56,637 --> 01:02:57,445
Hey!

1117
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:59,615
I know you turned yourself
up about this, kid,

1118
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,973
but I promise you, I'm
gonna make that movie.

1119
01:03:02,998 --> 01:03:04,143
- What happened?

1120
01:03:04,168 --> 01:03:05,239
- What, you mean next door?

1121
01:03:05,264 --> 01:03:06,215
- Yeah.

1122
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,883
- You're right, they're nice people.

1123
01:03:08,908 --> 01:03:09,716
- Yeah?

1124
01:03:09,741 --> 01:03:11,119
- She'd love to.

1125
01:03:11,144 --> 01:03:12,587
- She'd love to what?

1126
01:03:12,612 --> 01:03:14,479
- Go out to dinner with us.

1127
01:03:14,504 --> 01:03:16,535
You, me, Angelica, Dang.

1128
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,375
It'll be nice.

1129
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,175
- No, no way.
- All right, I'll tell her.

1130
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,008
- No no no no.

1131
01:03:20,033 --> 01:03:21,379
- That's my boy.

1132
01:03:21,404 --> 01:03:23,387
We're gonna have a great time.

1133
01:03:23,412 --> 01:03:27,799
Did you know that she's
a championship dancer?

1134
01:03:27,824 --> 01:03:28,983
I can't dance.

1135
01:03:29,008 --> 01:03:30,259
You'll learn.

1136
01:03:30,284 --> 01:03:33,514
Now, let us
begin to do the cha cha cha

1137
01:03:33,539 --> 01:03:35,823
basic step for the man.

1138
01:03:35,848 --> 01:03:37,054
Ready?

1139
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:39,859
Step back with the right foot.

1140
01:03:39,884 --> 01:03:43,634
Next, step forward in
place on the left foot.

1141
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:49,488
We have just completed the
basic step forward and back.

1142
01:03:49,513 --> 01:03:52,909
Now let us do the basic
step twice in succession

1143
01:03:52,934 --> 01:03:54,755
using the direction call...

1144
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:55,613
- Please?

1145
01:03:56,955 --> 01:03:58,670
- It's great, you learned
to go forward and back.

1146
01:03:58,695 --> 01:03:59,658
- Please?

1147
01:03:59,683 --> 01:04:01,054
Stand with feet together,

1148
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:02,702
weight over left foot.

1149
01:04:02,727 --> 01:04:03,560
Ready?

1150
01:04:04,455 --> 01:04:07,174
Cha cha cha, step forward, step back,

1151
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:10,098
cha cha cha, step back, step forward.

1152
01:04:10,123 --> 01:04:11,718
- You're anticipating, that's why,

1153
01:04:11,743 --> 01:04:13,262
you're not listening to the thing.

1154
01:04:13,287 --> 01:04:14,614
- How can I listen if you talk to me?

1155
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:15,846
- I didn't say a goddamn word.

1156
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,254
- Yes you did, come on, Joe!

1157
01:04:17,279 --> 01:04:18,446
Can I do this?

1158
01:04:24,808 --> 01:04:27,141
I'm just getting this thing.

1159
01:04:29,191 --> 01:04:30,902
Cha cha cha,
step forward, step back,

1160
01:04:30,927 --> 01:04:32,282
cha cha cha, step back...

1161
01:04:32,307 --> 01:04:33,115
- Don't forget the shoulders.

1162
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,789
- He talked so slow before,
now when the music starts,

1163
01:04:34,814 --> 01:04:35,762
he goes cha cha cha cha cha.

1164
01:04:35,787 --> 01:04:37,278
- The shoulders, you
gotta have the shoulders.

1165
01:04:37,303 --> 01:04:38,598
- This guy's an idiot.

1166
01:04:38,623 --> 01:04:41,286
- Honey, honey, you
gotta have the shoulders.

1167
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:42,119
- See?

1168
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:43,326
This is how slow he goes now.

1169
01:04:43,351 --> 01:04:46,506
Now when the music starts,
cha cha cha cha cha cha cha.

1170
01:04:46,531 --> 01:04:47,339
Cha cha cha...

1171
01:04:47,364 --> 01:04:48,302
- Just do it to the music.

1172
01:04:48,327 --> 01:04:49,894
- Why don't they have
the music slower then?

1173
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:52,253
If it's a beginner's record.

1174
01:04:52,278 --> 01:04:53,282
- Trust me.

1175
01:04:53,307 --> 01:04:55,286
Now let us try
the basic step to the music.

1176
01:04:55,311 --> 01:04:56,126
- I got a...

1177
01:04:56,151 --> 01:04:57,148
- Now be quiet.

1178
01:04:59,796 --> 01:05:01,379
Ready?

1179
01:05:03,939 --> 01:05:05,366
Cha cha cha, step forward, step back,

1180
01:05:05,391 --> 01:05:06,316
cha cha cha...

1181
01:05:06,341 --> 01:05:07,751
- That's it, you're getting it.

1182
01:05:07,776 --> 01:05:09,041
That's it.

1183
01:05:09,066 --> 01:05:10,509
- It's impossible.

1184
01:05:10,534 --> 01:05:12,281
- No, you're getting it, don't stop.

1185
01:05:12,306 --> 01:05:15,761
I made reservations for dinner and a limo.

1186
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:18,288
Without the directional call.

1187
01:05:18,313 --> 01:05:20,397
- A limo, isn't that a bit much?

1188
01:05:20,422 --> 01:05:21,505
- A bit much?

1189
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:24,266
For us?

1190
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:25,124
I say no.

1191
01:05:36,426 --> 01:05:37,259
- Is it?

1192
01:05:40,155 --> 01:05:42,773
- The rabbit runs around the
tree, goes down the hole,

1193
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:44,977
comes back out, okay?

1194
01:05:45,002 --> 01:05:46,297
There.

1195
01:05:46,322 --> 01:05:47,393
And it's simple.

1196
01:05:47,418 --> 01:05:50,335
Just like tying a bow on your shoe.

1197
01:05:51,602 --> 01:05:53,825
Phew, what is that smell?

1198
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,825
- It's cologne.

1199
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:56,683
- Cologne?

1200
01:05:57,570 --> 01:05:58,378
Ugh.

1201
01:05:58,403 --> 01:05:59,211
It's terrible.

1202
01:05:59,236 --> 01:06:00,065
- What do you mean?

1203
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:01,370
This is very expensive clove oil.

1204
01:06:01,395 --> 01:06:02,203
- Clove oil?

1205
01:06:02,228 --> 01:06:04,046
What are you, a salad?

1206
01:06:04,071 --> 01:06:05,546
Jesus.

1207
01:06:05,571 --> 01:06:06,454
- It smells bad?

1208
01:06:06,479 --> 01:06:08,200
- It smells terrible, here.

1209
01:06:10,829 --> 01:06:12,576
What you need is some of my stuff.

1210
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,990
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

1211
01:06:15,015 --> 01:06:15,943
- That's it.

1212
01:06:35,101 --> 01:06:36,698
- Happy new year.

1213
01:06:36,723 --> 01:06:37,586
- Happy new year.

1214
01:06:37,611 --> 01:06:38,731
- Don't worry, it's plastic.

1215
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:40,338
- Thank you.

1216
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:41,363
- Bless you.

1217
01:06:45,696 --> 01:06:46,863
- I smell ham.

1218
01:07:11,013 --> 01:07:12,955
- Too much excitement?

1219
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:14,559
- She said it's allergies.

1220
01:07:14,584 --> 01:07:15,584
- Allergies?

1221
01:07:23,878 --> 01:07:24,795
- You okay?

1222
01:07:26,748 --> 01:07:31,375
- I guess all that driving
around is what did it.

1223
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,223
Maybe you better take me home.

1224
01:07:34,248 --> 01:07:37,659
- Oh, you don't feel like
going dancing anymore?

1225
01:07:37,684 --> 01:07:39,184
- No, I guess not.

1226
01:07:40,233 --> 01:07:42,020
- Hey, you wanna dance here?

1227
01:07:42,045 --> 01:07:43,523
Watch these feet.

1228
01:07:43,548 --> 01:07:45,308
I'll dance my ass off.

1229
01:07:45,333 --> 01:07:46,640
What do you want, the rumba?

1230
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,720
What do you want, the conga?

1231
01:07:54,648 --> 01:07:57,481
Or I can do maybe a little ballet.

1232
01:08:02,373 --> 01:08:03,689
Joe had this
way of making people

1233
01:08:03,714 --> 01:08:05,979
feel important, even though you knew

1234
01:08:06,004 --> 01:08:08,063
he was taking you for a ride.

1235
01:08:08,088 --> 01:08:10,628
But that night I would've
ridden with him anywhere.

1236
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:12,011
He was magic.

1237
01:08:12,036 --> 01:08:13,943
There was nothing he couldn't handle.

1238
01:08:13,968 --> 01:08:15,383
The only thing you could do was sit back

1239
01:08:15,408 --> 01:08:17,319
and see what would happen next.

1240
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:19,419
- Hey, Aldolfo, we don't
need that dance joint.

1241
01:08:19,444 --> 01:08:20,660
The four of us, huh?

1242
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:23,815
We're all that's important.

1243
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:27,053
Forget about anything
I told you, this is it.

1244
01:08:27,078 --> 01:08:30,443
The man-made mountains
of Manhattan, and us,

1245
01:08:30,468 --> 01:08:33,718
four small micronisms in this universe.

1246
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:40,043
But together, we're as big as the world.

1247
01:08:40,068 --> 01:08:41,635
That's what it's about.

1248
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:43,315
Everyday's fine.

1249
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:46,656
Club Manhattan, let's get
some champagne and go home.

1250
01:09:09,089 --> 01:09:12,345
- So what's, I'm trying,
what's the number?

1251
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:13,732
- 555.

1252
01:09:13,757 --> 01:09:15,229
- 555.

1253
01:09:15,254 --> 01:09:16,087
- 4073.

1254
01:09:17,581 --> 01:09:18,414
- 4073.

1255
01:09:22,037 --> 01:09:22,845
Hello.

1256
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:23,678
Hello.

1257
01:09:23,703 --> 01:09:24,511
- Gregoire.

1258
01:09:24,536 --> 01:09:25,344
Yes, Gregoire here.

1259
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:27,029
- Bobby Asam from Queens.

1260
01:09:27,054 --> 01:09:28,814
Bobby Asam.

1261
01:09:30,045 --> 01:09:31,429
Guess what.

1262
01:09:31,454 --> 01:09:32,392
What?

1263
01:09:32,417 --> 01:09:36,456
- We just developed a mutual
friend, Angelica Pina.

1264
01:09:36,481 --> 01:09:37,289
- Pena.

1265
01:09:37,314 --> 01:09:39,260
- Pena, what's the difference?

1266
01:09:39,285 --> 01:09:40,093
My wife?

1267
01:09:40,118 --> 01:09:42,244
- Point is you owe her 3500.

1268
01:09:42,269 --> 01:09:44,357
- 3000.
- 3000.

1269
01:09:44,382 --> 01:09:45,715
- It's 3500 now.

1270
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:49,264
I just bought the debt.

1271
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:50,097
You bought?

1272
01:09:50,122 --> 01:09:50,930
- That's right.

1273
01:09:50,955 --> 01:09:52,249
Explain yourself, please.

1274
01:09:52,274 --> 01:09:54,690
- What the fuck is there to explain?

1275
01:09:54,715 --> 01:09:56,316
Okay, okay...

1276
01:09:56,341 --> 01:09:58,489
I thought you'd like that tone.

1277
01:09:58,514 --> 01:09:59,824
Okay, okay.

1278
01:09:59,849 --> 01:10:00,937
Okay, it's okay.

1279
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:02,629
- Sounds good.

1280
01:10:02,654 --> 01:10:03,680
We can work something out.

1281
01:10:03,705 --> 01:10:05,177
- I'll send someone by.

1282
01:10:06,389 --> 01:10:07,289
Happy new year.

1283
01:11:23,201 --> 01:11:24,525
Angelica.

1284
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:25,358
- What?

1285
01:11:25,383 --> 01:11:26,398
Show me the.

1286
01:11:26,423 --> 01:11:27,256
- Okay.

1287
01:11:32,862 --> 01:11:33,695
Okay.

1288
01:11:43,109 --> 01:11:44,395
Yeah?

1289
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:45,595
- You're very good.

1290
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:47,791
- Don't move the upper body,
just do it at the bottom.

1291
01:11:47,816 --> 01:11:49,331
Just the bottom?

1292
01:11:49,356 --> 01:11:50,290
Yeah.

1293
01:11:53,446 --> 01:11:56,823
- It just puts one purpose in my mind.

1294
01:11:56,848 --> 01:12:00,673
I look at you, the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen.

1295
01:12:03,174 --> 01:12:03,982
Angelica.

1296
01:12:04,007 --> 01:12:04,934
- No, no.

1297
01:12:04,959 --> 01:12:06,917
- Let me see your face.

1298
01:12:06,942 --> 01:12:09,345
You have such a beautiful face.

1299
01:12:09,370 --> 01:12:10,203
Angelica.

1300
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:15,579
- Get off of me!

1301
01:12:18,762 --> 01:12:19,694
- What'd you do?

1302
01:12:19,719 --> 01:12:21,209
Angelica.

1303
01:12:21,234 --> 01:12:22,401
What'd you do?

1304
01:12:23,862 --> 01:12:24,695
Angelica.

1305
01:12:25,528 --> 01:12:27,402
I didn't do anything.

1306
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:28,351
- Angelica, wait a minute...

1307
01:12:28,376 --> 01:12:29,184
- Don't touch me.

1308
01:12:29,209 --> 01:12:31,125
- Come on, he's a little
out of control, I know,

1309
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:32,057
but it's new year's.

1310
01:12:32,082 --> 01:12:33,617
- He had his tongue halfway down my throat

1311
01:12:33,642 --> 01:12:35,205
and you just stood there!

1312
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:36,332
- I'm sorry.

1313
01:12:36,357 --> 01:12:38,073
I'm upset too.

1314
01:12:38,098 --> 01:12:39,181
- He's a pig!

1315
01:12:40,021 --> 01:12:43,425
- He's gonna be producing the movie.

1316
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:45,450
You'll never even have to see
him once we start shooting.

1317
01:12:45,475 --> 01:12:47,850
- And what kinda movie are
you gonna make with that guy?

1318
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:48,708
Crapman?

1319
01:12:50,336 --> 01:12:53,761
You're either stupid or dumb, Aldolfo.

1320
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:54,786
It's a joke.

1321
01:12:57,850 --> 01:12:58,990
- Well what about us?

1322
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:03,601
- What about us?

1323
01:13:03,626 --> 01:13:05,160
She forgot this.

1324
01:13:05,185 --> 01:13:06,677
- Give me that, Joe.

1325
01:13:06,702 --> 01:13:07,785
Give me that!

1326
01:13:10,985 --> 01:13:12,901
- Hey, you can't really blame me, can ya?

1327
01:13:12,926 --> 01:13:14,941
She's really gorgeous.

1328
01:13:14,966 --> 01:13:16,965
Those sexy, come-hither eyes.

1329
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:19,293
Those dancing, pulsating thighs.

1330
01:13:19,318 --> 01:13:21,068
- Funny anymore, Joe!

1331
01:13:22,638 --> 01:13:23,685
- Listen.

1332
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:26,327
Not gonna let this fuck things up, are ya?

1333
01:13:26,352 --> 01:13:30,446
Hey, that's just her way of
showing you that she loves you.

1334
01:13:30,471 --> 01:13:32,357
Come on, give Joe a kiss.

1335
01:13:32,382 --> 01:13:33,345
- Get off me!

1336
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:35,453
Give us one kiss.

1337
01:13:46,585 --> 01:13:51,168
- Just don't forget, we start
shooting in a month, huh?

1338
01:14:13,418 --> 01:14:14,681
Let me in!

1339
01:14:14,706 --> 01:14:15,701
- Leave me alone!

1340
01:14:15,726 --> 01:14:16,693
Let me in!

1341
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:17,561
- I'm trying to sleep!

1342
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:18,394
Let me in!

1343
01:14:18,419 --> 01:14:19,550
Aldolfo!

1344
01:14:22,077 --> 01:14:23,830
Let me in, Aldolfo!

1345
01:14:23,855 --> 01:14:25,361
I know what you're doing!

1346
01:14:25,386 --> 01:14:27,850
You're practicing switching
hands without missing a stroke!

1347
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:28,810
- Will you go away?!

1348
01:14:28,835 --> 01:14:29,995
- You little pecker jerk-off!

1349
01:14:31,026 --> 01:14:31,834
- Asshole.

1350
01:14:31,859 --> 01:14:32,713
- Happy new year!

1351
01:14:32,738 --> 01:14:34,235
Make your resolution.

1352
01:14:36,218 --> 01:14:37,051
Come on.

1353
01:14:37,945 --> 01:14:39,325
- All right, Joe, I forgive you, okay?

1354
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:41,305
Come on, I gotta go to sleep.

1355
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:42,495
- You gotta sleep?

1356
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,677
What's wrong with this guy, huh?

1357
01:14:43,702 --> 01:14:45,117
- Oh, nothing, we're
making a movie, that's all.

1358
01:14:45,142 --> 01:14:47,185
He's just, only thing
is, kid, this is work,

1359
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:49,866
you're just not seeing it, huh?

1360
01:14:49,891 --> 01:14:52,607
How about these two
girls, and they're very,

1361
01:14:52,632 --> 01:14:54,341
very interested in cinema.

1362
01:14:54,366 --> 01:14:55,330
- Why not?

1363
01:14:55,355 --> 01:14:56,321
- That's right.

1364
01:14:56,346 --> 01:14:57,154
- Why not?

1365
01:14:57,179 --> 01:14:58,171
Oh my god, come here.

1366
01:14:58,196 --> 01:14:59,004
- What?

1367
01:14:59,029 --> 01:14:59,837
- Why not?

1368
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:00,670
She said that.

1369
01:15:00,695 --> 01:15:02,281
Great title for a movie, right?

1370
01:15:02,306 --> 01:15:03,209
- Why Not?

1371
01:15:03,234 --> 01:15:04,636
- Big letters, Why Not.

1372
01:15:04,661 --> 01:15:07,994
Why not one, why not two,
one for me, one for you.

1373
01:15:08,019 --> 01:15:09,089
Maybe two for you?

1374
01:15:09,114 --> 01:15:10,397
No, one, I think just one.

1375
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:11,641
- Let me get some ice.

1376
01:15:11,666 --> 01:15:13,577
- Wait, wait, I don't have
anything to drink, really.

1377
01:15:13,602 --> 01:15:14,956
- No no no.

1378
01:15:14,981 --> 01:15:17,821
- Just go to a bar or something
and I'll meet you there.

1379
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,185
- I thought you said this
guy was a director, Joe, huh?

1380
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:20,294
What's the matter with him?

1381
01:15:20,319 --> 01:15:21,127
- He is, he is.

1382
01:15:21,152 --> 01:15:22,845
He was just born serious, that's all.

1383
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:23,897
- Don't take your coat off.

1384
01:15:23,922 --> 01:15:24,945
- Come here, come here,
you take your coat off.

1385
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:26,774
Listen, I want you to
go in there with Jackie,

1386
01:15:26,799 --> 01:15:28,037
she's got something to say to you,

1387
01:15:28,062 --> 01:15:29,237
and she's very talented.

1388
01:15:29,262 --> 01:15:31,021
She's got no hams, unlike...

1389
01:15:31,046 --> 01:15:32,654
- You got some fucking nerve...

1390
01:15:32,679 --> 01:15:35,761
- Hey, you want me to take Suzie,

1391
01:15:35,786 --> 01:15:38,145
and she and I will see you in the hallway

1392
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:39,660
so fucking loud...
- Okay!

1393
01:15:39,685 --> 01:15:41,054
- I thought you'd see it.

1394
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:42,689
Have a good time.

1395
01:15:42,714 --> 01:15:43,709
- Poker?

1396
01:15:43,734 --> 01:15:45,181
- Yeah, you bet.

1397
01:15:45,206 --> 01:15:46,873
Poker her, poker me.

1398
01:15:53,506 --> 01:15:57,006
You know, I know how to lose at this game?

1399
01:16:01,312 --> 01:16:04,145
- Here, hold this for me, will ya?

1400
01:16:09,212 --> 01:16:10,129
- Ah, shit.

1401
01:16:11,136 --> 01:16:12,056
- Oops.

1402
01:16:12,081 --> 01:16:12,914
Sorry.

1403
01:16:14,948 --> 01:16:15,756
Want some?

1404
01:16:15,781 --> 01:16:17,383
- No.

1405
01:16:17,408 --> 01:16:19,944
- Oh, that's right, you're depressed.

1406
01:16:23,781 --> 01:16:26,781
- Mind if I put my head in your lap?

1407
01:16:30,084 --> 01:16:32,067
- Hey look, why don't you use this pillow?

1408
01:16:32,092 --> 01:16:34,592
- No no no, I like the warmth.

1409
01:16:45,682 --> 01:16:47,220
- Look, why don't I
just give you a blowjob,

1410
01:16:47,245 --> 01:16:48,474
we call it a night.

1411
01:16:48,499 --> 01:16:49,307
- Please no.

1412
01:16:49,332 --> 01:16:50,647
I don't want that, okay?

1413
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:51,682
- No?

1414
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:52,874
- No, I don't.

1415
01:16:53,752 --> 01:16:55,252
- Oh, well, sorry.

1416
01:16:57,273 --> 01:16:59,227
I was just trying to help.

1417
01:16:59,252 --> 01:17:00,398
- I don't need any help, okay?

1418
01:17:00,423 --> 01:17:02,890
Especially from someone like you.

1419
01:17:02,915 --> 01:17:05,662
- Especially from someone like me?

1420
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:08,770
Hey, you don't even know me, okay?

1421
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:10,178
- I'm having a bad night, all right?

1422
01:17:10,203 --> 01:17:11,782
You know?

1423
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:14,418
- Oh, well boohoo, do I
look like I'm having a ball?

1424
01:17:14,443 --> 01:17:16,159
- Hey, I didn't invite you in here.

1425
01:17:16,184 --> 01:17:18,514
- Well look, I'm stuck here
until whenever, I don't know.

1426
01:17:18,539 --> 01:17:19,866
- Well fine.

1427
01:17:19,891 --> 01:17:20,891
- Well fine.

1428
01:17:22,515 --> 01:17:23,765
Stay depressed.

1429
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:30,034
Are you most
interested in romance movies?

1430
01:17:30,059 --> 01:17:32,239
I really
don't think, I don't know

1431
01:17:32,264 --> 01:17:34,851
how to answer that question.

1432
01:17:34,876 --> 01:17:36,209
- Oh my god.

1433
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:39,168
This kid is not very talkative.

1434
01:17:39,193 --> 01:17:40,483
- No, give me that.

1435
01:17:40,508 --> 01:17:42,103
- That's you on The Naked Truth.

1436
01:17:42,128 --> 01:17:42,990
Oh my god.

1437
01:17:43,015 --> 01:17:44,968
Hey you guys, you gotta come here!

1438
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:46,464
- Hey, hey, shut up.

1439
01:17:46,489 --> 01:17:48,346
It's something I did for money, okay?

1440
01:17:48,371 --> 01:17:51,374
- Oh my god, that is so sleazy,
I wouldn't be caught dead

1441
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:53,424
on The Naked Truth, I am sorry, buddy.

1442
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:56,206
- I didn't know what kind of show it was.

1443
01:17:56,231 --> 01:17:57,239
- That is unbelievable.

1444
01:17:57,264 --> 01:17:58,906
That is you on The Naked Truth.

1445
01:17:58,931 --> 01:18:00,346
I did it for exposure.

1446
01:18:00,371 --> 01:18:02,342
Yeah, well
you've got it, all right.

1447
01:18:02,367 --> 01:18:03,987
- Shut this off, please?

1448
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:09,726
- That is so bad.

1449
01:18:14,651 --> 01:18:16,546
Yeah, you're all right.

1450
01:18:16,571 --> 01:18:18,059
Hmm?

1451
01:18:18,084 --> 01:18:22,667
- Look, I'm sorry if I insulted
you or something, I am.

1452
01:18:25,191 --> 01:18:27,185
- That's all right.

1453
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:28,960
You didn't insult me.

1454
01:18:36,475 --> 01:18:37,308
I'm sorry.

1455
01:18:53,124 --> 01:18:53,957
Oh man.

1456
01:18:57,912 --> 01:19:01,154
- Did you wanna put your head in my lap?

1457
01:19:01,179 --> 01:19:03,096
- No, I don't think so.

1458
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:05,636
Good night.

1459
01:19:10,195 --> 01:19:11,003
- Bye.
- Bye.

1460
01:19:11,028 --> 01:19:11,836
- Bye baby.

1461
01:19:11,861 --> 01:19:12,694
- Bye.

1462
01:19:17,194 --> 01:19:20,040
Did your little Vinnie have a big time?

1463
01:19:23,249 --> 01:19:24,079
Come here.

1464
01:19:24,104 --> 01:19:26,644
- Joe, we really have to talk, okay?

1465
01:19:26,669 --> 01:19:27,845
I'm serious now.

1466
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:29,132
- Okay, let's talk.

1467
01:19:30,796 --> 01:19:31,604
See?

1468
01:19:31,629 --> 01:19:34,462
Something always comes between us.

1469
01:19:38,808 --> 01:19:39,641
- For you.

1470
01:19:41,321 --> 01:19:42,508
- Hello?

1471
01:19:42,533 --> 01:19:43,366
Yeah?

1472
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:46,512
Yeah.

1473
01:19:51,909 --> 01:19:52,742
Yeah.

1474
01:20:01,589 --> 01:20:05,297
I don't know how to tell you this, kid.

1475
01:20:05,322 --> 01:20:08,277
But we got the money to make the film.

1476
01:20:10,243 --> 01:20:12,544
- Yeah, where is it?

1477
01:20:12,569 --> 01:20:15,048
We're gonna go to work and we got it.

1478
01:20:15,073 --> 01:20:16,292
Let's go.

1479
01:20:16,317 --> 01:20:17,597
Come on.

1480
01:20:17,622 --> 01:20:18,455
Come on.

1481
01:20:19,605 --> 01:20:20,644
Hey.

1482
01:20:20,669 --> 01:20:22,086
Cecil B. Aldolfo.

1483
01:20:23,097 --> 01:20:24,108
Who was I kidding?

1484
01:20:24,133 --> 01:20:26,298
You didn't just quit with a guy like Joe.

1485
01:20:26,323 --> 01:20:28,488
We met Skippy that night in a warehouse

1486
01:20:28,513 --> 01:20:30,272
to discuss the next move.

1487
01:20:30,297 --> 01:20:31,412
This was it.

1488
01:20:31,437 --> 01:20:33,500
I was in to the bitter end.

1489
01:20:33,525 --> 01:20:35,072
- Don't sweat it, kid.

1490
01:20:35,097 --> 01:20:35,930
It's time.

1491
01:20:38,002 --> 01:20:41,240
- Joe was right, you really are an artist.

1492
01:20:41,265 --> 01:20:43,652
Sure about this kid, absolutely.

1493
01:20:43,677 --> 01:20:45,427
- What do I gotta do?

1494
01:20:46,495 --> 01:20:50,042
- Take a ride with me
to Brooklyn, we park,

1495
01:20:50,067 --> 01:20:52,764
you get out, go around the
corner, you see a gorilla,

1496
01:20:52,789 --> 01:20:54,880
you see a midget.

1497
01:20:54,905 --> 01:20:58,655
You say to that midget,
Joe Blow from Kokomo,

1498
01:20:59,913 --> 01:21:01,795
he gives you something, that's it.

1499
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:02,653
Huh?

1500
01:21:03,769 --> 01:21:06,460
- And don't fuck it up.

1501
01:21:06,485 --> 01:21:08,634
- Wait, I'm sorry, can you repeat...

1502
01:21:08,659 --> 01:21:09,576
- Oh, fuck!

1503
01:21:10,610 --> 01:21:11,462
- Skippy.

1504
01:21:11,487 --> 01:21:12,320
Skippy.

1505
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:15,497
Aldolfo.

1506
01:21:15,522 --> 01:21:17,105
We take a ride to Brooklyn.

1507
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:19,223
We park the car.

1508
01:21:19,248 --> 01:21:21,782
You get out, go around the corner.

1509
01:21:21,807 --> 01:21:24,993
You see a gorilla, you see a midget.

1510
01:21:25,018 --> 01:21:26,957
- So who are you?

1511
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:28,429
- Who am I?

1512
01:21:28,454 --> 01:21:29,454
Who are you?

1513
01:21:30,417 --> 01:21:31,250
- Hello!

1514
01:21:33,999 --> 01:21:36,040
Can you believe this guy?

1515
01:21:42,042 --> 01:21:44,625
For the last time, who are you?

1516
01:21:46,458 --> 01:21:48,375
- Joe Blow from Kokomo.

1517
01:22:03,755 --> 01:22:04,570
- That's it!

1518
01:22:04,595 --> 01:22:05,502
You were great, kid.

1519
01:22:05,527 --> 01:22:06,778
Jesus!

1520
01:22:06,803 --> 01:22:08,343
Christ you were great.

1521
01:22:08,368 --> 01:22:09,230
Huh?

1522
01:22:09,255 --> 01:22:10,912
Now you gotta do one more thing, okay?

1523
01:22:10,937 --> 01:22:12,778
You go down to E-Z Rent-a-Car,

1524
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:14,890
you pick up a car under
the name of Anderson

1525
01:22:14,915 --> 01:22:17,035
and you bring it back, we're finished.

1526
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:18,418
- I don't want these drugs in my house.

1527
01:22:18,443 --> 01:22:19,526
- Oh, I don't either.

1528
01:22:19,551 --> 01:22:20,935
Ooh, drugs are so bad.

1529
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,735
But I'm going to turn 'em into money.

1530
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:23,568
Huh?

1531
01:22:23,593 --> 01:22:24,806
And you're clean, nobody knows you.

1532
01:22:24,831 --> 01:22:26,458
Jesus Christ, we make the movie.

1533
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:28,690
And you can make that girl
next door a movie star.

1534
01:22:28,715 --> 01:22:29,523
Huh?

1535
01:22:29,548 --> 01:22:31,078
- I still don't understand what I did.

1536
01:22:31,103 --> 01:22:34,627
- Aldolfo, Aldolfo, I love
you, I love you, I love you.

1537
01:22:34,652 --> 01:22:36,358
What's there to understand?

1538
01:22:36,383 --> 01:22:37,330
The midget bought it.

1539
01:22:37,355 --> 01:22:39,238
Now you gotta do one more thing.

1540
01:22:39,263 --> 01:22:41,578
You gotta go down to E-Z Rent-a-Car,

1541
01:22:41,603 --> 01:22:43,857
pick up a car under the name of Anderson,

1542
01:22:43,882 --> 01:22:47,031
bring it back, and it's finished.

1543
01:22:49,295 --> 01:22:52,870
- Look, Aries, Aprils,
Ackerman, Alvarez, Avakian,

1544
01:22:52,895 --> 01:22:54,653
Avatelli-Brown.

1545
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:58,926
Now, unless it's Anderson and
it ain't spelled with an A.

1546
01:22:58,951 --> 01:23:01,902
Could it be Anderson without an A?

1547
01:23:01,927 --> 01:23:02,862
What do you mean?

1548
01:23:02,887 --> 01:23:04,750
You can't spell Anderson without an A.

1549
01:23:04,775 --> 01:23:06,010
- No shit.

1550
01:23:06,035 --> 01:23:07,870
Then I guess you don't
have a reservation, pal.

1551
01:23:07,895 --> 01:23:09,478
No car.

1552
01:23:10,945 --> 01:23:11,778
No Joe.

1553
01:23:14,557 --> 01:23:15,474
No nothin'.

1554
01:23:18,262 --> 01:23:19,555
I had to find him.

1555
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:23,163
I was getting tired of
being fucked around.

1556
01:23:30,585 --> 01:23:31,418
Holy shit.

1557
01:23:32,697 --> 01:23:33,530
Skippy.

1558
01:23:37,349 --> 01:23:39,257
Something had to have gone wrong.

1559
01:23:39,282 --> 01:23:42,738
There must be one pissed
off midget out there.

1560
01:23:42,763 --> 01:23:44,180
Maybe I was next.

1561
01:23:45,809 --> 01:23:50,809
I had to see Angelica, if only
to talk to her one last time.

1562
01:23:57,989 --> 01:23:58,822
What?

1563
01:24:00,642 --> 01:24:01,475
Angelica.

1564
01:24:03,853 --> 01:24:05,792
I guess you were right.

1565
01:24:05,817 --> 01:24:08,067
I am either stupid or dumb.

1566
01:24:10,017 --> 01:24:11,732
I decided right then and there it was time

1567
01:24:11,757 --> 01:24:14,424
for Aldolfo Rollo to fight back.

1568
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:34,767
- Come on, will you get in the car?

1569
01:24:34,792 --> 01:24:36,996
I'll get a ride somewhere, okay?

1570
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:44,745
- Hey, Aldolfo.

1571
01:24:47,888 --> 01:24:49,015
- This is just perfect.

1572
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,500
What are you doing?

1573
01:24:50,525 --> 01:24:52,663
- Where's my money, Joe?

1574
01:24:52,688 --> 01:24:54,283
- Listen to me.

1575
01:24:54,308 --> 01:24:55,827
You could've been followed.

1576
01:24:55,852 --> 01:24:58,180
- Oh, bullshit, I'm sick
of your stories, Joe.

1577
01:24:58,205 --> 01:24:59,875
- I had to go out of
state to clean the money.

1578
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:01,003
- What's the matter with you?

1579
01:25:01,028 --> 01:25:02,800
- What about you, what are
you, friends with him now?

1580
01:25:02,825 --> 01:25:04,795
I thought he was a pig.

1581
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:06,267
- Look, I'm getting out of the car.

1582
01:25:06,292 --> 01:25:08,023
- No no, wait, Angelica.

1583
01:25:10,296 --> 01:25:11,796
Don't you see?
- What?

1584
01:25:13,868 --> 01:25:17,800
- This dummy, he thinks I was
double-crossing him with you.

1585
01:25:17,825 --> 01:25:19,495
- I don't know what the
two of you are up to,

1586
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,951
all I know is he was bringing me

1587
01:25:20,976 --> 01:25:23,080
the 3000 from Gregoire, okay?

1588
01:25:23,105 --> 01:25:24,103
Take me to work.

1589
01:25:24,128 --> 01:25:25,160
And what's the matter with you?

1590
01:25:25,185 --> 01:25:26,979
How could you fuck with
that kid like that?

1591
01:25:27,004 --> 01:25:28,045
What's going on, Aldolfo?

1592
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:29,340
- Where's my money?

1593
01:25:29,365 --> 01:25:30,597
- One thing, Aldolfo.

1594
01:25:30,622 --> 01:25:32,442
That's not my kid.

1595
01:25:32,467 --> 01:25:33,833
- What?

1596
01:25:33,858 --> 01:25:35,757
You said it was your kid.

1597
01:25:35,782 --> 01:25:36,884
- I lied.

1598
01:25:36,909 --> 01:25:40,345
I have a kid, but that's not him.

1599
01:25:41,929 --> 01:25:43,376
- Great, kidnapping now.

1600
01:25:43,401 --> 01:25:44,529
That's nothing.

1601
01:25:44,554 --> 01:25:46,629
My brother's dead and
they're after my ass.

1602
01:25:46,654 --> 01:25:48,340
- What does he mean his brother's dead?

1603
01:25:48,365 --> 01:25:49,198
- Ask him.

1604
01:25:50,089 --> 01:25:51,669
- People have died for this.

1605
01:25:51,694 --> 01:25:53,080
Now we're gonna take the kid home

1606
01:25:53,105 --> 01:25:56,816
and then we're going to
the beach, god dammit.

1607
01:25:56,841 --> 01:25:58,674
Stupid son of a bitch.

1608
01:26:00,561 --> 01:26:01,561
Why, Skippy?

1609
01:26:07,789 --> 01:26:11,285
- How could you think
this could ever work?

1610
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:12,310
Look at him.

1611
01:26:14,481 --> 01:26:15,898
What is he doing?

1612
01:26:18,274 --> 01:26:19,240
He's crazy.

1613
01:26:19,265 --> 01:26:20,515
- I don't know.

1614
01:26:24,804 --> 01:26:26,304
- I wanna go home.

1615
01:26:28,505 --> 01:26:30,189
- I'll fuckin' get him.

1616
01:26:30,214 --> 01:26:33,744
I'm really gonna fuckin' get him.

1617
01:26:33,769 --> 01:26:35,019
I owe you that.

1618
01:26:37,761 --> 01:26:39,220
- Hey Joe, what's going on?

1619
01:26:39,245 --> 01:26:41,620
- Basically I'm fucked.

1620
01:26:41,645 --> 01:26:42,812
Skippy's dead.

1621
01:26:44,301 --> 01:26:46,768
You know how you begin something,

1622
01:26:46,793 --> 01:26:49,376
and then it starts to become something,

1623
01:26:49,401 --> 01:26:52,196
and then it becomes something else?

1624
01:26:52,221 --> 01:26:53,554
It changes, huh?

1625
01:26:56,196 --> 01:26:58,632
Slowly but surely, the thing you love

1626
01:26:58,657 --> 01:27:00,649
becomes a burden, right?

1627
01:27:01,777 --> 01:27:03,536
- Listen, Joe, you're
not making the movie,

1628
01:27:03,561 --> 01:27:05,890
so why don't we just give it up, okay?

1629
01:27:05,915 --> 01:27:07,209
- I can't give anything.

1630
01:27:07,234 --> 01:27:09,110
Maybe you can walk away.

1631
01:27:09,135 --> 01:27:11,844
But I can't, I got responsibilities.

1632
01:27:11,869 --> 01:27:13,300
- All right.

1633
01:27:13,325 --> 01:27:15,880
Look, I forgive you for using me, okay?

1634
01:27:15,905 --> 01:27:17,529
- Oh, that's what you said.

1635
01:27:17,554 --> 01:27:19,539
- Well you used him, Joe.

1636
01:27:19,564 --> 01:27:21,647
- You're right, Angelica.

1637
01:27:23,014 --> 01:27:25,332
I went and I bought a newspaper,

1638
01:27:25,357 --> 01:27:27,309
and I went right to the want ads,

1639
01:27:27,334 --> 01:27:30,309
and the personals, there
it was, big as a billboard.

1640
01:27:30,334 --> 01:27:32,829
500-page script for sale.

1641
01:27:32,854 --> 01:27:35,829
Now I say to myself, what idiot would sell

1642
01:27:35,854 --> 01:27:37,044
a 500-page script?

1643
01:27:37,069 --> 01:27:39,776
Aldolfo Rollo, that's who, perfect, right?

1644
01:27:39,801 --> 01:27:42,072
Nobody knows Aldolfo Rollo.

1645
01:27:42,097 --> 01:27:43,452
But things change.

1646
01:27:43,477 --> 01:27:46,136
You think I would spend
all this time with you

1647
01:27:46,161 --> 01:27:47,860
if I was using you?

1648
01:27:47,885 --> 01:27:50,544
Come here, look at this, do you see this?

1649
01:27:50,569 --> 01:27:51,912
What's in his belly?

1650
01:27:51,937 --> 01:27:53,469
What's that green stuff, huh?

1651
01:27:53,494 --> 01:27:55,300
You could buy a lot of
cans of film with that.

1652
01:27:55,325 --> 01:27:58,104
- But film, there's no movie, Joe.

1653
01:27:58,129 --> 01:28:00,265
- Aldolfo, don't say that.

1654
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:02,936
Don't ruin a beautiful day, look at this.

1655
01:28:02,961 --> 01:28:05,980
I mean, you and I at the
beach with your fiancee?

1656
01:28:06,005 --> 01:28:07,256
- Fiancee?

1657
01:28:07,281 --> 01:28:08,172
- Yeah.

1658
01:28:08,197 --> 01:28:10,752
The producer, the director, and the star,

1659
01:28:10,777 --> 01:28:12,214
talking about the film, I love it.

1660
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:14,525
- Joe, she wants to go home.

1661
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:17,169
- It was a mistake to bring her, huh?

1662
01:28:17,194 --> 01:28:18,786
- She's scared.

1663
01:28:18,811 --> 01:28:22,026
- Hey, I'm the first to admit I'm wrong.

1664
01:28:22,051 --> 01:28:24,236
But I gotta talk to you about this film.

1665
01:28:24,261 --> 01:28:25,916
- Joe, will you cut the bullshit already?

1666
01:28:25,941 --> 01:28:28,944
You never wanted to do the
movie, you just wanted the money.

1667
01:28:28,969 --> 01:28:30,976
Will you give me the fuckin'
keys so I can take her home?

1668
01:28:31,001 --> 01:28:33,360
- Give a shit about the
money, you take the money.

1669
01:28:33,385 --> 01:28:34,772
- Fuck you with the money!

1670
01:28:34,797 --> 01:28:36,214
- Fuck the money!

1671
01:28:38,725 --> 01:28:41,400
- Fuckin' asshole, you know that?

1672
01:28:41,425 --> 01:28:42,699
- I'm not the asshole...

1673
01:28:42,724 --> 01:28:44,700
- Why do you always gotta say
the same thing over and over?

1674
01:28:44,725 --> 01:28:46,469
I know, I'm an idiot, I'm an idiot, okay?

1675
01:28:46,494 --> 01:28:49,124
But I mean, enough already with the movie.

1676
01:28:49,149 --> 01:28:51,164
Can we get the fuck outta here?

1677
01:28:51,189 --> 01:28:52,531
Come on, give me the keys to
the car, I'll take her home.

1678
01:28:52,556 --> 01:28:53,539
- Get your hands off me!

1679
01:28:53,564 --> 01:28:54,372
- Come on, will ya?

1680
01:28:54,397 --> 01:28:55,230
Give me the...

1681
01:28:56,063 --> 01:28:56,871
- Hey, hey.

1682
01:28:56,896 --> 01:28:58,770
- Give me the keys to the car.

1683
01:28:58,795 --> 01:29:01,936
I'm tired of this boy stuff,
so give me the keys to the car!

1684
01:29:01,961 --> 01:29:04,788
- Hey, Angelica, don't, you're
making Aldolfo very nervous.

1685
01:29:04,813 --> 01:29:05,956
Angelica, calm down.

1686
01:29:05,981 --> 01:29:07,832
- Fuck telling me to calm down!

1687
01:29:07,857 --> 01:29:08,665
Angelica...

1688
01:29:08,690 --> 01:29:09,498
- Give me the keys.

1689
01:29:09,523 --> 01:29:10,428
- Here, you want the keys, baby?

1690
01:29:10,453 --> 01:29:11,296
- Don't call me baby.

1691
01:29:11,321 --> 01:29:12,240
Don't play with me.

1692
01:29:12,265 --> 01:29:13,425
- Here baby, give me the gun.

1693
01:29:14,469 --> 01:29:15,302
Jesus.

1694
01:29:20,086 --> 01:29:21,546
I fooled you, huh?

1695
01:29:21,571 --> 01:29:22,876
- Oh, Jesus.

1696
01:29:22,901 --> 01:29:24,180
Shithead!

1697
01:29:24,205 --> 01:29:25,800
- Hey, Aldolfo, it's all right.

1698
01:29:25,825 --> 01:29:27,276
Let her go, let her go.

1699
01:29:27,301 --> 01:29:29,192
Hey, wait a minute, no, let her go,

1700
01:29:29,217 --> 01:29:31,305
it's okay, it's all right.

1701
01:29:31,330 --> 01:29:33,256
Women, hysterical, right?

1702
01:29:33,281 --> 01:29:37,608
Listen, I lost the
sweetest thing I ever had.

1703
01:29:37,633 --> 01:29:38,776
Come on.

1704
01:29:38,801 --> 01:29:40,232
Come on.

1705
01:29:40,257 --> 01:29:41,507
She'll be back.

1706
01:29:43,061 --> 01:29:46,486
You could spend a lifetime
chasing after her, Aldolfo.

1707
01:29:46,511 --> 01:29:49,440
For Christ's sakes, we got
the ocean all to ourselves.

1708
01:29:49,465 --> 01:29:51,325
Now come on, let's sit down.

1709
01:30:05,665 --> 01:30:06,768
What do you know?

1710
01:30:06,793 --> 01:30:08,793
It really works, listen.

1711
01:30:11,021 --> 01:30:13,647
- Yeah, I know, it's the ocean.

1712
01:30:13,672 --> 01:30:14,505
- Really?

1713
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:21,246
It's nice here, huh Aldolfo?

1714
01:30:22,146 --> 01:30:25,563
I love to watch the sunrise by the beach.

1715
01:30:27,253 --> 01:30:29,420
- It's the afternoon, Joe.

1716
01:30:33,477 --> 01:30:36,310
- Well, you can't have everything.

1717
01:30:41,113 --> 01:30:45,601
You know the one thing I
really wanted to do the most?

1718
01:30:45,626 --> 01:30:47,626
Unconditional Surrender.

1719
01:30:49,046 --> 01:30:50,546
I hate that title.

1720
01:30:52,409 --> 01:30:56,409
But I really wanted to
make your movie, Aldolfo.

1721
01:31:00,462 --> 01:31:03,756
I guess you could say I
got bit by the bug, huh?

1722
01:31:08,789 --> 01:31:10,706
Make that movie, buddy.

1723
01:31:12,081 --> 01:31:15,852
Make it the greatest
fuckin' movie ever made.

1724
01:31:15,877 --> 01:31:17,627
Make it a love story.

1725
01:31:18,772 --> 01:31:20,772
Will you do that for me?

1726
01:31:34,991 --> 01:31:37,408
You don't owe me a dime, kid.

1727
01:31:40,824 --> 01:31:42,574
Wipe the slate clean.

1728
01:31:50,484 --> 01:31:54,651
- Hey, you remember when
you said we're important?

1729
01:31:55,984 --> 01:31:57,984
This may sound nuts, but

1730
01:32:00,127 --> 01:32:03,234
what if we made a film about us?

1731
01:32:03,259 --> 01:32:04,367
You know?

1732
01:32:04,392 --> 01:32:07,539
Just something simple, I mean,

1733
01:32:07,564 --> 01:32:10,359
it's like you said, it's not
about the money, you know,

1734
01:32:10,384 --> 01:32:12,522
I mean it doesn't have to be
the greatest movie ever made,

1735
01:32:12,547 --> 01:32:14,202
we just do it.

1736
01:32:14,227 --> 01:32:18,294
Just me, you, Angelica, if
she'll ever talk to me again.

1737
01:32:18,319 --> 01:32:21,319
You know, maybe even get Dang in it?

1738
01:32:22,745 --> 01:32:27,578
I don't know, we just forget
the drugs, just make a movie.

1739
01:32:29,446 --> 01:32:30,279
You know?

1740
01:32:34,329 --> 01:32:36,246
God, what do you think?

1741
01:32:37,462 --> 01:32:38,295
Hey.

1742
01:32:39,669 --> 01:32:41,700
Come on, quit fuckin' around, asshole.

1743
01:32:41,725 --> 01:32:42,558
Hey.

1744
01:32:43,537 --> 01:32:44,370
Hey.

1745
01:32:48,553 --> 01:32:49,386
Joe?

1746
01:32:51,277 --> 01:32:52,452
Joe?

1747
01:32:52,477 --> 01:32:53,310
Joe!

1748
01:33:12,563 --> 01:33:14,083
I guess I'll never know if he was serious

1749
01:33:14,108 --> 01:33:18,854
about making my film, or if
he really was just using me.

1750
01:33:18,879 --> 01:33:20,446
It doesn't matter.

1751
01:33:20,471 --> 01:33:24,054
When I make my movie
it'll be a love story.

1752
01:33:32,407 --> 01:33:34,740
And I'll dedicate it to Joe.

1753
01:33:37,012 --> 01:33:40,429
You know I never even knew his last name?
