1
00:00:01,325 --> 00:00:04,325
(suspenseful music)

2
00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:35,011
(instrumental R&B music)

3
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:40,818
Freeze, motherfucker!

4
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:43,871
Fuck!

5
00:00:50,032 --> 00:00:51,634
Goddamn it!

6
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,374
He jumped, he's going
down to the ninth floor,

7
00:00:53,374 --> 00:00:54,707
the ninth floor!

8
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:02,009
Mike, he's on the ninth floor.

9
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,090
Goddamn it, now stop!

10
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:15,083
I said stop, motherfucker.

11
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,172
Shit!

12
00:01:16,172 --> 00:01:18,005
Relax, relax, relax!

13
00:01:20,756 --> 00:01:24,923
Just get the fuck off me!
(Chris grunts)

14
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:29,222
- Freeze, goddamn it!
- [Nick] Oh, shit!

15
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:32,495
[Chris] Nicky.
(grunts)

16
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:35,269
You're pretty, motherfucker.

17
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:36,981
Did little Nicky fall
down and get bruised?

18
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:37,888
[Nicky] Shut the fuck up!

19
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:39,640
Shut the fuck up, Nicky!

20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,391
That's gonna leave a mark, Nick.

21
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:44,139
When the fuck did you turn 5-0?

22
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:45,301
Why'd you run out on us?

23
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:47,209
Man, fuck you!

24
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:48,189
Hell, this is bullshit!

25
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:49,724
Shut the fuck up!

26
00:01:49,724 --> 00:01:51,182
All you had to do was
give us a name, man.

27
00:01:51,182 --> 00:01:53,337
Man, you ain't got nothin' on me, man.

28
00:01:53,337 --> 00:01:54,527
One name, you could've walked.

29
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:56,771
Man, I didn't do nothin'!

30
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:57,604
Chris.

31
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:03,052
What's this?

32
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:05,352
Oh, hell no, you know
that shit ain't mine!

33
00:02:05,352 --> 00:02:06,316
Shut the fuck up.

34
00:02:06,316 --> 00:02:08,809
Looks like some high
quality cocaine, Nick.

35
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:11,602
Get up, you little shit.

36
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:12,827
Took you a long time for this, Nick.

37
00:02:12,827 --> 00:02:14,129
You know that shit ain't mine!

38
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:16,800
Nick, this is Officer
Donnelly, I'm Officer White,

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,139
you're under arrest.

40
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,112
- [Nick] Fuck you!
- Nice to meet you, Nick.

41
00:02:20,112 --> 00:02:23,112
You have the right to remain silent.

42
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:38,517
So, what's the verdict, Harris?

43
00:02:38,517 --> 00:02:42,220
Lookin' fine, real fine.
(Denise laughs)

44
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,727
I'm talking about the bus.

45
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:49,331
The bus is a piece of
shit, but it looks great.

46
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:51,928
Is this the best they could do?

47
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:54,124
Yeah, this is the
pick of the motor pool.

48
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:57,755
I can do the best for
the youth of America.

49
00:02:57,755 --> 00:03:01,922
Speakin' of these young
Americans, what we lookin' at?

50
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:04,868
You're gonna love this.

51
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:15,077
First up is Cecile Washington,
also known as "Ce-Ce."

52
00:03:16,348 --> 00:03:19,235
Fresh out of a 28-day stay.

53
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:20,099
And that?

54
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,849
Since the home, like
mother, like daughter.

55
00:03:24,863 --> 00:03:26,568
What do we have here?

56
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:28,885
This one is Nicholas Gordon.

57
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:31,433
[Harris] Looks like
a real wannabe badass.

58
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:33,986
Oh yeah, he's a badass all right.

59
00:03:33,986 --> 00:03:35,153
Next, Ray-Ray,

60
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:38,219
Raymond Martin.

61
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:42,806
He came up in the streets with Nick.

62
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:46,585
Who's Cinderella?

63
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:49,683
[Denise] Charlotte Davis,
some little lost girl,

64
00:03:49,683 --> 00:03:51,850
she started a fire at school.

65
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,961
And that earned her a spot
here with the wild bunch?

66
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:56,597
Whole school burned down.

67
00:03:56,597 --> 00:03:58,847
Next, we have Eddie Jasper.

68
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,348
He don't look too tough.

69
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:03,545
[Denise] He considers himself a crusader

70
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:06,056
for the African-American people.

71
00:04:06,056 --> 00:04:08,848
He'll debate your ear off,
but he's pretty harmless.

72
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,691
He was just at the wrong
place at the wrong time.

73
00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:12,949
All right, listen up.

74
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:15,048
You already know me.

75
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:19,623
The gentleman to my right
is Lt. Harris Redding.

76
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:22,566
We will be your chaperones
on this little excursion.

77
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:24,177
Just where the fuck are we goin' again?

78
00:04:24,177 --> 00:04:25,359
Didn't your mama ever teach you it's

79
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:28,226
it's not polite to interrupt
others? Understand?

80
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,785
And watch your fuckin' mouth, boy.

81
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:35,202
Nick, we're going to Lakahachee Canyon.

82
00:04:36,457 --> 00:04:38,481
(laughs) "Laksa-fuckee" where?

83
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:40,910
Listen up, badass number two,

84
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,034
you start showing some R-E-S-P-E-C-T,

85
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,475
else you gonna find
out what it mean to me.

86
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:48,753
Shit, bro, get with the times.

87
00:04:48,753 --> 00:04:51,643
Don't be quoting that 1960s shit at me.

88
00:04:51,643 --> 00:04:53,198
[Denise] All right, all right.

89
00:04:53,198 --> 00:04:55,481
It's Lakahachee Canyon, all right kids?

90
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:57,148
It's 200 miles away.

91
00:04:57,992 --> 00:05:00,295
We're gonna be there for 90 days.

92
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:02,207
We're doing some renovations on a home

93
00:05:02,207 --> 00:05:05,742
for some youthful
offenders like yourselves.

94
00:05:05,742 --> 00:05:07,075
Any questions?

95
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:11,365
Yes?

96
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:13,766
Do you think that maybe
we'd be able to call home?

97
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:16,166
(laughter)
Call home?

98
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,852
So you can talk to Mommy?

99
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:19,744
No, I just thought that...

100
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:20,899
No, you don't think!

101
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:22,780
You just listen, little girl.

102
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,209
Until told otherwise,

103
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:27,213
Miss Martinez is your
mommy and I'm your daddy.

104
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:28,296
You got that?

105
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:36,731
[Denise] All right,
everybody on the bus.

106
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:50,957
All right, all right.

107
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:53,579
Let's not make this any
worse than it has to be.

108
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:57,246
[Harris] That's right,
no clowning around.

109
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:04,527
When do we stop and get
somethin' to eat, man?

110
00:06:04,527 --> 00:06:05,360
I'm starving.

111
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,693
We stop when I get hungry.

112
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,522
Yo, are you sure this thing is safe?

113
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:13,931
Man, quit complaining.

114
00:06:13,931 --> 00:06:17,514
This thing'll get us there
and halfway back. (Chuckles)

115
00:06:17,514 --> 00:06:20,931
(instrumental R&B music)

116
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:02,774
Hey, Charlotte?

117
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:04,295
How you holdin' up?

118
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:06,211
I can't believe I'm even here.

119
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:08,564
None of us really wanna be here.

120
00:07:08,564 --> 00:07:12,500
But, we gotta suck it up and
make the best of it, right?

121
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
(sighs)

122
00:07:15,537 --> 00:07:18,007
What do you say we pull
over and grab a bite to eat?

123
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:20,558
Sign back there said
there's a place up ahead.

124
00:07:20,558 --> 00:07:21,725
Sounds good.

125
00:07:45,854 --> 00:07:48,024
Oh, hell no! This has gotta be a joke,

126
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:49,839
what the hell are we stopping here for?

127
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,506
What's wrong with here?

128
00:07:51,506 --> 00:07:52,847
It's a damn rat hole.

129
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,408
Then why don't you guys crawl right in

130
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:55,977
and make yourselves at home?

131
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:56,966
Look, bitch!

132
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:58,058
You keep talkin' like
that, you're gonna be

133
00:07:58,058 --> 00:08:00,248
drinkin' your food
through a fuckin' straw!

134
00:08:00,248 --> 00:08:02,260
All right, everybody, now listen up.

135
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,145
No one wanders off, okay?

136
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:08,270
Neither Harris or myself
wants to come lookin' for ya.

137
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,770
It's gonna really piss us off.

138
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,774
(birds chirping)

139
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:19,888
Okay! Use the bathroom if you have to,

140
00:08:19,888 --> 00:08:22,449
get something to eat and get back on board.

141
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:23,969
You mean we gotta eat here too?

142
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,051
That's affirmative.

143
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:29,167
Then, we gotta get back on the road ASAP.

144
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:31,250
And number two, hurry up.

145
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,469
Why?

146
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:36,923
Because that's number
two, hurry up, now let's go.

147
00:08:36,923 --> 00:08:37,830
(Ray laughs)

148
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,163
Sorry I asked.

149
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:42,111
Any other questions?

150
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:43,539
Are you wearing any panties?

151
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,852
(laughter)

152
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:46,769
Let's go.

153
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,638
Ce-Ce, aren't you gonna go?

154
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:55,625
No.

155
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,871
We don't have another
stop for a really long time.

156
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,092
I'm okay, okay?

157
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:02,642
Is this about Ray-Ray and
Nick, 'cause believe me,

158
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,802
I can take care of them.

159
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:07,393
I don't need nobody taking
care of nothing for me.

160
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:10,583
I'm just not hungry, is that all right?

161
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,750
That's fine.

162
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:14,733
Suit yourself.

163
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,709
(blow dryer)

164
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:25,021
What the fuck are you doing?

165
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:28,470
I'm just arming myself,
I need condoms, man.

166
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,383
Don't want some little
bastard talkin' shit about me

167
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:33,054
20 years from now, you know
what I'm sayin'? (Chuckles)

168
00:09:33,054 --> 00:09:34,026
You actually think
you're gonna get somewhere

169
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:35,562
with these crazy bitches?

170
00:09:35,562 --> 00:09:37,061
That Ce-Ce's pretty fine.

171
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:38,696
Ce-Ce's a cold fish.

172
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:40,472
Well, a couple months
out in the damn boonies

173
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:44,804
might just warm her up
if you know what I mean?

174
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:47,434
Now, Miss Martinez, she's fine.

175
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:48,943
- Martinez?
- [Ray] Yeah.

176
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:50,315
Man, she's a cop.

177
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:54,279
Oh well, I mean damn, she
ain't no cop when she naked.

178
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:58,446
Ain't nowhere to pin the badge. (Chuckles)

179
00:10:01,846 --> 00:10:03,763
- Hey, Charlotte.
- Hey.

180
00:10:07,354 --> 00:10:09,354
(sighs)

181
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:15,277
Where's Ce-Ce?

182
00:10:15,277 --> 00:10:16,860
Still on the bus.

183
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:20,895
You spoke to her yet?

184
00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:21,976
About what?

185
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:23,212
Anything?

186
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:27,097
No. She's hardly said two words to me.

187
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:27,930
Why?

188
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:32,497
I don't know I'm just trying to

189
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:35,333
figure that girl out, you know?

190
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,333
Good luck.

191
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,083
(dramatic music)

192
00:11:09,656 --> 00:11:12,180
Hey, you doin' okay?

193
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,172
Yeah, I'm fine.

194
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:17,672
Need a little catnap, let me know, okay?

195
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,275
You ever driven one of these things?

196
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:24,829
(scoffs) I could handle it.

197
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:27,207
I'll bet you could.
(Denise laughs)

198
00:11:27,207 --> 00:11:29,643
(rumbling)

199
00:11:29,643 --> 00:11:31,894
- What was that?
- Didn't sound good.

200
00:11:31,894 --> 00:11:33,498
What is going on now?

201
00:11:33,498 --> 00:11:34,761
Looks like we're fucked?

202
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,460
Okay everybody, just calm down,

203
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,913
we're gonna pull over and check it out.

204
00:11:38,913 --> 00:11:43,080
I knew it, I knew it.
(suspenseful music)

205
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:03,236
I wanna get a closer
look at this engine.

206
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:05,455
Okay, I'm gonna try to
get someone on the cell,

207
00:12:05,455 --> 00:12:06,622
get some help.

208
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,950
Look, can we get some air up in here?

209
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,539
I'm dyin' of carbon dioxide.

210
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:25,622
(laughs)

211
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,081
Something funny, bitch?

212
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,835
It's "carbon monoxide," moron.

213
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,249
That's the sort of thing
you would've learned

214
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:35,110
had you made it past the third grade.

215
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,055
Look, motherfucker,
I'll show you third grade.

216
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:38,577
All right you guys!

217
00:12:38,577 --> 00:12:40,280
Just settle down, okay?

218
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,417
Yeah, sure.

219
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:42,556
I heard some crazy shit about

220
00:12:42,556 --> 00:12:44,729
people that live in places like this.

221
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:47,551
Yeah, those chainsaw
families out here and shit?

222
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:49,213
Crazy fuckers be wearin' a brother's face

223
00:12:49,213 --> 00:12:51,327
like a Halloween mask and shit.

224
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,784
Ooh, shit yeah.

225
00:12:52,784 --> 00:12:54,852
And you don't even wanna
be trying to barbecue,

226
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:57,429
you know what I'm saying?

227
00:12:57,429 --> 00:13:00,396
Keep your mouths shut and
your asses in the seats.

228
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:03,063
(engine hisses)

229
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,956
(coughs) How's it goin'?

230
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,289
Engine's gone.

231
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,296
Luck is one thing we're
shit out of just now.

232
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,371
Can't get a signal on
the cell phone, either?

233
00:13:19,371 --> 00:13:21,714
Why does this shit always happen to me?

234
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:24,349
(laughter)

235
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:28,516
(Ray imitates eerie sound effects)

236
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:34,434
Well, looks like one of us
is gonna have to go for help.

237
00:13:34,434 --> 00:13:36,177
One of us.

238
00:13:36,177 --> 00:13:38,910
You ever been in the woods?

239
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,327
No, not really.

240
00:13:41,802 --> 00:13:45,052
It's okay. I love the great outdoors.

241
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:48,186
[Ray] You don't look
to happy, Miss Charlotte.

242
00:13:48,186 --> 00:13:51,436
Shut up!
(both laugh)

243
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:54,351
Now listen, why don't
you take the guys with you?

244
00:13:54,351 --> 00:13:56,563
I think it's safer that way.

245
00:13:56,563 --> 00:13:59,164
Maybe I would feel
safer if they're with me,

246
00:13:59,164 --> 00:14:00,719
for your sake.

247
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:01,864
Listen, take the cell phone,

248
00:14:01,864 --> 00:14:04,330
maybe you can get a signal
out there somewhere,

249
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,498
call for help.

250
00:14:05,498 --> 00:14:09,028
Great. Maybe I can order pizza.

251
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:10,476
Let's get the troops.

252
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:13,226
(dramatic music)

253
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:25,499
I want you boys to stay close.

254
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:27,504
I don't want anybody gettin' lost.

255
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:29,433
We're all lost.

256
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:33,600
Yeah but, we're all lost
together. Big difference.

257
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:36,971
Man, this place is fuckin' creepy.

258
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:38,721
Yeah, I hate trees.

259
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:42,057
This ain't so bad.

260
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:44,134
I grew up in the country.

261
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:47,643
I bet you did.
(Nick laughs)

262
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:50,658
I bet you just a regular John-Boy Walton.

263
00:14:50,658 --> 00:14:53,207
Good night, John-Boy. (Laughs)

264
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:55,540
Yeah. Somethin' like that.

265
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,226
Are there like, any
wild animals out here?

266
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:03,124
We're in the fuckin'
woods for fuck's sake.

267
00:15:03,124 --> 00:15:05,452
We're surrounded by wild animals.

268
00:15:05,452 --> 00:15:07,272
- Punk ass bitch.
- Fuck you, man.

269
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:08,419
You know what the hell I mean.

270
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:09,321
Cool it, cool it!

271
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:10,700
Cool it!

272
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,731
There actually are a couple of things

273
00:15:11,731 --> 00:15:14,799
you need to look out for. Me for one.

274
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,106
There's bears, there's
coyotes, there may be snakes.

275
00:15:19,106 --> 00:15:20,185
I knew that shit.

276
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:24,026
Fuckin' always lookin'
over my shoulder, man.

277
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:27,026
Lions and tigers and bears, oh my.

278
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:30,962
Hey.

279
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:35,017
I think I see something.

280
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:38,359
Over there.
Civilization.

281
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:43,098
It's as close as we're
ever gonna get to it.

282
00:15:43,098 --> 00:15:45,848
- Come on, let's go.
- Whoa! Whoa.

283
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:48,115
Now look, he last thing we wanna do

284
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,238
is go barreling down there

285
00:15:49,238 --> 00:15:52,043
and have somebody getting
their head blown off.

286
00:15:52,043 --> 00:15:53,996
What you're gonna do is
you're gonna follow me,

287
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:55,671
and we gonna take it nice and easy.

288
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:57,719
We don't wanna scare nobody.

289
00:15:57,719 --> 00:15:59,025
Who, us?

290
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:01,112
Look, I'm not playin' with you, Nick.

291
00:16:01,112 --> 00:16:02,844
And we don't know who's down there.

292
00:16:02,844 --> 00:16:04,229
[Nick] Whoever they
are, I bet the last thing

293
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,735
they're expecting on their front porch

294
00:16:05,735 --> 00:16:08,067
is four Black dudes from LA.

295
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,860
Not all the sheets there
on the beds are here.

296
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,666
Look, whatever. If you guys
just listen to what I say,

297
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,083
we'll be all right. Let's go.

298
00:16:43,175 --> 00:16:44,305
[Nick] Ooh-wee boys,

299
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:47,555
I think we done found hillbilly heaven.

300
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:56,395
[Eddie] Yeah, and I thought
my neighborhood was bad.

301
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:57,622
All right guys, chill out.

302
00:16:57,622 --> 00:17:00,030
Remember, we don't wanna
scare these people.

303
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,290
We need their help.

304
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,373
Come on, let's go.
(Eddie coughs)

305
00:17:10,003 --> 00:17:13,004
(Harris knocks on door)

306
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:15,587
[Harris] Hello? Anybody home?

307
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:18,314
Great, nobody home.

308
00:17:19,175 --> 00:17:21,251
Screw it man, I just say we break in.

309
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:22,442
Forget, Nick.

310
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,517
Well, excuse me, sir.

311
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:25,593
I mean we're stranded out here,

312
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:26,941
what the fuck else we supposed to do?

313
00:17:26,941 --> 00:17:28,667
Yeah, it ain't like we
trying to rob the place

314
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,056
or nothin' like that.

315
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:32,574
Let's just go inside, use
the phone, and get some help.

316
00:17:32,574 --> 00:17:33,790
We can wait.

317
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,504
Somebody'll be home eventually.

318
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:36,587
Eventually.

319
00:17:38,045 --> 00:17:39,969
This place looks like a junkyard.

320
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:41,879
How do we know anybody even lives there?

321
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:44,991
Well, it's obviously not
abandoned, there's lights.

322
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:46,107
You guys just hang tight here,

323
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:49,379
I'm gonna go up the hill and see if I can

324
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:51,796
signal on this piece of shit.

325
00:17:56,861 --> 00:17:58,797
(sighs) That man is crazy.

326
00:17:58,797 --> 00:18:01,224
He ain't gonna get anybody
on that thing, not out here.

327
00:18:01,224 --> 00:18:02,474
I heard that.

328
00:18:03,362 --> 00:18:05,487
Man, it's cold as shit out here!

329
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:06,762
I heard that too.

330
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:09,203
I'm not about to sit out
here and freeze my ass off.

331
00:18:09,203 --> 00:18:11,203
So, what you gonna do?

332
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:15,591
This is some bullshit, man.

333
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:20,976
I'm 'bout to make myself at home.

334
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,976
Thats what I'm sayin'.

335
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,717
Oh, man.
(instrumental R&B music)

336
00:18:46,022 --> 00:18:48,939
(cell phone beeps)

337
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:58,728
Middle of no-fuckin'-where.

338
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:01,852
Fuck!

339
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,757
Hey, where's the light?

340
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:10,711
Ow, shit!

341
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,906
I'm tellin' you, man,
you guys are goin' too far.

342
00:19:13,906 --> 00:19:18,073
You heard what Redding said,
he's gonna nail you two.

343
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:30,299
Come on, man, hurry up!

344
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:41,316
[Harris] What's going on here?

345
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:42,649
Where's Ray-Ray?

346
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:47,553
Eddie?
(suspenseful music)

347
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,363
[Ray] Where's the light?

348
00:19:49,363 --> 00:19:51,363
Damn! Where's the light?

349
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:57,002
(weapon cocks)
Oh, shit.

350
00:20:03,797 --> 00:20:05,964
(gunshot)

351
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,090
Damn, you crazy redneck bitch!

352
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,259
(whimpers)

353
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,164
Don't even think about it unless

354
00:20:20,164 --> 00:20:22,413
you wanna end up layin'
there with your friend.

355
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:23,315
Just as easy to have two of your

356
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:26,045
dead carcasses hauled outta here as one.

357
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:28,081
Three wouldn't other me none either.

358
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:30,294
Just calm down for a minute, please.

359
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:32,280
(coughs and wheezes)

360
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,966
Jesus, he's still alive.

361
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,749
Leave him!

362
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:37,763
He may be dying.

363
00:20:37,763 --> 00:20:38,596
Listen...

364
00:20:38,596 --> 00:20:40,370
Listen, you're trespassin' on my land.

365
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,981
And that gives you the
right to shoot somebody?

366
00:20:41,981 --> 00:20:44,618
God gave me the right, but
the pleasure was all mine.

367
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,868
Bitch!
(weapon cocks)

368
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:52,015
Don't say I didn't warn ya.

369
00:20:52,015 --> 00:20:54,265
It will not be like this.

370
00:20:55,574 --> 00:20:57,741
(gunshot)

371
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,750
Don't fuck with my kids.

372
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,585
(exhales)
(Ray-Ray coughs)

373
00:21:07,585 --> 00:21:10,784
Damn, way to take care of business, sir!

374
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:13,479
Y'all talk about
double, just stay still.

375
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:14,729
(coughs)

376
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:17,920
- [Ray] It hurts!
- I know, I know.

377
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,837
What are we gonna do?

378
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:23,532
Guys, help me get him up, come on, man.

379
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,282
(groans, coughs)

380
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:29,847
All right, you think you
remember how to get back?

381
00:21:29,847 --> 00:21:31,310
Yeah, I think so, what about you?

382
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,562
I'm gonna hang out here
and check this place out,

383
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:34,694
look for a phone.

384
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:35,527
If I can't find one,

385
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,030
I'm gonna go get some help somewhere else,

386
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,209
but, just go, get outta here!

387
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:42,626
(Ray groans)

388
00:21:50,724 --> 00:21:53,724
All we wanted was to use your phone.

389
00:21:58,761 --> 00:21:59,640
[Eddie] I don't think we should've

390
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,515
left Mr. Redding back there alone.

391
00:22:01,515 --> 00:22:03,295
[Nick] And what are we supposed to do?

392
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:05,085
He told us to go!

393
00:22:05,085 --> 00:22:06,864
Besides, he can take care of himself.

394
00:22:06,864 --> 00:22:08,787
You saw the way he took
that bitch's head off.

395
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:12,135
See, that's what I'm talking about, man.

396
00:22:12,135 --> 00:22:14,237
(Ray groans)

397
00:22:14,237 --> 00:22:15,720
What the hell was that?

398
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,488
Damn, it's another gunshot!

399
00:22:17,488 --> 00:22:18,662
There's more bullets flying around here

400
00:22:18,662 --> 00:22:19,874
than in South Central.

401
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:21,720
Jesus, Mr. Redding,
we gotta go back, man.

402
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,220
Look man, there's nothing
we can do for him now.

403
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,083
You don't know that.

404
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,773
Look, I know I ain't goin' back there.

405
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:30,756
I hear a gunshot, my ass goes
in the opposite direction.

406
00:22:30,756 --> 00:22:33,077
All right, now let's go.

407
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:34,184
Miss Martinez, do you think that

408
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:36,517
the guys are okay out there?

409
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:40,809
We should've stuck to the road.

410
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:44,918
Would've been longer, but
it would've been safer.

411
00:22:44,918 --> 00:22:47,433
Think we're gonna be here all night.

412
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:49,830
That wouldn't surprise me.

413
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,302
Listen, why don't you lie
down and get some rest, okay?

414
00:22:53,302 --> 00:22:55,490
There's no use in both
of us being up all night.

415
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,168
Miss Martinez, I can't sleep.

416
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,001
I know.

417
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:02,456
Well, why don't we just...
See what's coming.

418
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:03,817
(footsteps)

419
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,454
Hello?

420
00:23:05,454 --> 00:23:06,869
What the hell happened?

421
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:09,404
[Nick] This crazy
Alabama bitch shot him!

422
00:23:09,404 --> 00:23:10,891
[Charlotte] Oh my God!

423
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:11,787
Is he okay?

424
00:23:11,787 --> 00:23:14,067
[Eddie] No, he's bad, he's real bad.

425
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:18,438
(gasping, wheezing)
(suspenseful music)

426
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,554
[Denise] Did you get some help?

427
00:23:19,554 --> 00:23:21,280
Help? Does it look like we got any help?

428
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,654
Shit, we helped get a
bullet put in Ray-Ray's ass.

429
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:24,801
That's the kinda help we got.

430
00:23:24,801 --> 00:23:28,038
We need some medical
help, we need some guns.

431
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:29,435
We need the Air Force.

432
00:23:29,435 --> 00:23:30,852
We need the S1Ws!

433
00:23:31,871 --> 00:23:32,875
Where's Redding?

434
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:33,933
He told us on to on ahead.

435
00:23:33,933 --> 00:23:36,883
He went to look for a phone,
but I don't think he found one.

436
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,466
Damn these woods!

437
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,424
(whimpers)

438
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:50,653
Where's the light?

439
00:23:50,653 --> 00:23:52,471
Where's the light?

440
00:23:52,471 --> 00:23:54,010
Where's the light?

441
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,139
Where's the light?

442
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:57,222
Where's the light?

443
00:23:57,222 --> 00:23:58,351
[Nick] Where's the light?

444
00:23:58,351 --> 00:24:00,268
The bleeding stopped.

445
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:02,975
[Nick] We're still gonna
have to get help for him fast.

446
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:06,748
Well, we sure as hell aren't
gettin' anywhere on this bus.

447
00:24:06,748 --> 00:24:09,566
And Who knows how far
behind us those bastards are?

448
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:11,047
Let 'em come.

449
00:24:11,047 --> 00:24:11,931
Look, This ain't no time for you

450
00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:13,339
to be gettin' no brass balls.

451
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:15,222
They probably killed my partner!

452
00:24:15,222 --> 00:24:16,615
They're probably gonna
be killing us next!

453
00:24:16,615 --> 00:24:18,789
Fine, let 'em fucking try!

454
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:21,146
Look, if that's the way you wanna be...

455
00:24:21,146 --> 00:24:22,125
What are you doing?

456
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,190
I'm taking charge!

457
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,626
What are you, fucking nuts?

458
00:24:24,626 --> 00:24:25,459
Are you?

459
00:24:25,459 --> 00:24:29,626
Miss Martinez, please!
(suspenseful music)

460
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,928
Okay, okay, okay, I'm okay.

461
00:24:35,928 --> 00:24:39,143
It's just that Redding was like my...

462
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:40,540
What, homie?

463
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,651
Yeah, I know how you feel.

464
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:44,694
But, right now, it ain't
no time for revenge,

465
00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:46,527
we do that shit later.

466
00:24:47,622 --> 00:24:50,720
Right now, we got to survive.

467
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,553
All right?

468
00:24:52,948 --> 00:24:56,281
Where' s the light? Where's the light?

469
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:00,349
[Nick] Let's go.

470
00:25:01,605 --> 00:25:03,245
We've been walking for over an hour,

471
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:06,629
we've gotta find something soon.

472
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:10,046
Just keep moving, that's all we can do.

473
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:13,851
How's Ray-Ray doin'?

474
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:16,224
[Nick] He's holding
up, I'm getting tired.

475
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:19,525
(exhales) Yeah, this
dude is gettin' heavy.

476
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:20,500
Yeah, look, we are all tired.

477
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,035
Can't we just stop for a few minutes?

478
00:25:23,035 --> 00:25:26,319
[Denise] Okay. We're gonna
stop right here, all right?

479
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,299
[Charlotte] Oh, thank you.

480
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,048
But, just for a few minutes.

481
00:25:30,048 --> 00:25:33,338
Look, why don't you sit down?

482
00:25:33,338 --> 00:25:34,837
You look like you've had it.

483
00:25:34,837 --> 00:25:36,834
(breathes heavily) I ain't stoppin'

484
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,560
till we're out of here.

485
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,373
God, I'm freezing.

486
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:43,290
Yeah. Can we build a fire please?

487
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:46,558
How'd I know you'd be
the one to suggest that?

488
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:48,276
Hey, lay off her, bro.

489
00:25:48,276 --> 00:25:50,246
We all got our skeletons in our closets.

490
00:25:50,246 --> 00:25:52,400
Yeah, and I'm not about to be one.

491
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,290
Look, jackass, we build a
fire, somebody's gonna see it.

492
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:59,487
Look, if I'm gonna die
out here, I'm dying warm.

493
00:25:59,487 --> 00:26:01,332
Where the fuck are you going?

494
00:26:01,332 --> 00:26:04,665
To take a piss. Is that okay with you?

495
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:21,260
Hey, look over there. There's a light.

496
00:26:23,528 --> 00:26:27,206
Oh, thank you Jesus! Indoor plumbing.

497
00:26:27,206 --> 00:26:29,442
Look, not so fast.

498
00:26:29,442 --> 00:26:32,608
I'm not walking into
another ambush. Not again.

499
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:36,673
If we are gonna do this, we do this slow.

500
00:26:36,673 --> 00:26:38,663
I'll take point.

501
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,913
Nick, this is not a game.

502
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,299
I know, that's what I've been saying.

503
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:46,299
This is war.

504
00:26:49,393 --> 00:26:52,393
(suspenseful music)

505
00:27:26,163 --> 00:27:28,746
What the hell is all this shit?

506
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:43,362
Look, don't move, all right?

507
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:44,195
I ain't here to hurt you,

508
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:47,530
just as long as you don't
give me any problems.

509
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,465
Look lady, we don't want any trouble,

510
00:27:49,465 --> 00:27:52,548
we just need some help for my friend.

511
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:57,618
Then, you've come to the right place.

512
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:03,192
You and your friends
are welcome in my home.

513
00:28:03,192 --> 00:28:05,895
Come in, my dear, come in.

514
00:28:05,895 --> 00:28:08,006
You must be cold and tired,

515
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:11,589
and your friend, better
get him inside too.

516
00:28:15,997 --> 00:28:20,164
(suspenseful music)
(door squeaks on hinges)

517
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:41,681
(wheezing)

518
00:28:43,361 --> 00:28:45,052
I'm Kadja Boszo.

519
00:28:45,052 --> 00:28:47,447
Hi, I'm Denise Martinez.

520
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:51,050
I am really sorry for breaking
into your house like this,

521
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,625
but, we're desperate.

522
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:53,837
I understand.

523
00:28:53,837 --> 00:28:55,891
Do you have a phone we could use?

524
00:28:55,891 --> 00:28:57,973
No, I am sorry.

525
00:28:57,973 --> 00:29:01,105
Do you have a car that we
could borrow to get some help?

526
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:03,952
[Kadja] No, I'm sorry, I don't...

527
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:07,430
Look, my boy Ray-Ray's
hurt real bad, all right?

528
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:11,263
He's gonna die if you
don't get him some help.

529
00:29:20,785 --> 00:29:22,486
Look, can you help him or not?

530
00:29:22,486 --> 00:29:25,446
I can help him if he
wants to stay with us,

531
00:29:25,446 --> 00:29:27,937
or I can help him if he wants to leave.

532
00:29:27,937 --> 00:29:30,604
Either way, I can be of service.

533
00:29:34,758 --> 00:29:37,341
(tribal music)

534
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:47,737
(wheezing)

535
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:49,404
What is she doing?

536
00:29:53,047 --> 00:29:54,880
I think it's Voodoo.

537
00:29:55,748 --> 00:29:57,685
- What?
- Voodoo.

538
00:29:57,685 --> 00:30:00,157
What kind of bullshit is that?

539
00:30:00,157 --> 00:30:02,711
[Denise] I don't know, some
people think it can heal.

540
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:04,124
Yeah, sounds like you're one of 'em.

541
00:30:04,124 --> 00:30:08,937
Listen to me, we don't have
a lot of options right now.

542
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:10,985
Can you save him?

543
00:30:10,985 --> 00:30:11,985
I can try.

544
00:30:13,387 --> 00:30:15,439
You better do more than just try.

545
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,798
Now who's out of control?

546
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:17,631
Back up!

547
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,243
That what you're holding is suddenly

548
00:30:20,243 --> 00:30:22,660
getting very heavy, isn't it?

549
00:30:24,178 --> 00:30:26,059
Too much of a burden.

550
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:28,464
So many people in the
history of this troubled path

551
00:30:28,464 --> 00:30:30,730
have carried its weight.

552
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,647
Put it down, my friend.

553
00:30:33,806 --> 00:30:34,806
Put it down.

554
00:30:44,272 --> 00:30:46,472
Okay, everybody,

555
00:30:46,472 --> 00:30:50,639
just let her work.
(suspenseful music)

556
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:03,154
(insects chirping)

557
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:04,273
[Nick] Well, how is he?

558
00:31:04,273 --> 00:31:05,977
He's resting.

559
00:31:05,977 --> 00:31:07,481
Is he gonna live or what?

560
00:31:07,481 --> 00:31:09,479
I don't know, it's up to him now.

561
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:11,558
So much for your black magic.

562
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:13,603
I knew all that shit was bullshit.

563
00:31:13,603 --> 00:31:15,755
(chuckles) It's easier to

564
00:31:15,755 --> 00:31:18,559
believe in nothing than something.

565
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,189
Yeah, I think I heard that
on a fortune cookie somewhere.

566
00:31:21,189 --> 00:31:23,687
My grandmother used
to believe in Voodoo.

567
00:31:23,687 --> 00:31:26,657
But, she always told me
to stay away from it.

568
00:31:26,657 --> 00:31:27,917
Said the price could be too high and

569
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:31,998
end up in the wrong hands,
or some shit like that.

570
00:31:31,998 --> 00:31:33,665
She was very wise.

571
00:31:34,505 --> 00:31:36,384
I remember she told me a story once

572
00:31:36,384 --> 00:31:39,634
when I was really young about a spirit.

573
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,720
An evil spirit named "Killjoy."

574
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,039
"Killjoy"? What kind of fucked up

575
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,706
name is that for an evil spirit?

576
00:31:48,186 --> 00:31:50,792
She told me the story
about this boy who turned to

577
00:31:50,792 --> 00:31:54,697
black magic to get revenge on
a gang that was bullying him.

578
00:31:54,697 --> 00:31:57,754
He tried to summon the spirit
of Killjoy, but failed,

579
00:31:57,754 --> 00:32:01,026
and the gang ended up murdering him.

580
00:32:01,026 --> 00:32:02,747
But, that wasn't the end.

581
00:32:02,747 --> 00:32:05,866
Killjoy resurrected the body,
brought him back to life,

582
00:32:05,866 --> 00:32:09,356
and used him to get revenge
by killing the gang.

583
00:32:09,356 --> 00:32:11,858
The boy thought that
Killjoy was serving him,

584
00:32:11,858 --> 00:32:14,936
but in truth, Killjoy was using the boy.

585
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:17,862
Using him to kill, to get stronger.

586
00:32:17,862 --> 00:32:21,031
Is there supposed to be some
type of moral to this story?

587
00:32:21,031 --> 00:32:24,507
Yeah. Don't be messin'
with this crazy shit.

588
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:26,785
(eerie music)

589
00:32:26,785 --> 00:32:29,607
Nick, don't wander off.

590
00:32:29,607 --> 00:32:31,926
Look, I need some space, all right?

591
00:32:31,926 --> 00:32:35,555
I'll be back when storytime is over.

592
00:32:35,555 --> 00:32:37,138
It'll be all right.

593
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,383
He's got a lot of anger.

594
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:46,664
Doesn't everybody?

595
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,399
(sighs)

596
00:32:56,259 --> 00:33:00,230
Man, this is one fucked
up road trip. (Scoffs)

597
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,608
Yeah, you got that right.

598
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:05,252
I sure could use a hit
of somethin' right now.

599
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:07,669
Anything to escape this crap.

600
00:33:08,622 --> 00:33:11,643
Let's get some rest, okay?

601
00:33:11,643 --> 00:33:14,393
We'll go for help in the morning.

602
00:33:16,866 --> 00:33:19,366
(clock ticks)

603
00:33:22,224 --> 00:33:25,833
- [Nick] Maybe I can help.
- You holdin'?

604
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:26,666
Maybe.

605
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:29,303
What you got?

606
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:36,561
Look, first tell me something.

607
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:37,902
What?

608
00:33:37,902 --> 00:33:39,401
You don't actually
believe that Voodoo bullshit

609
00:33:39,401 --> 00:33:41,296
you were spoutin' off in there, do you?

610
00:33:41,296 --> 00:33:43,947
Yeah, I believe it, I
grew up all around it.

611
00:33:43,947 --> 00:33:46,112
What you gettin' at?

612
00:33:46,112 --> 00:33:49,652
Gettin' at trying to save Ray-Ray.

613
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,694
Wait, are you thinkin'
what I think you're thinkin'?

614
00:33:52,694 --> 00:33:54,903
Look, I'm not just gonna
sit by and let him die.

615
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:57,920
But, black magic ain't nothing
to be fuckin' around with.

616
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,375
Shit, I will do whatever
it takes to get Ray-Ray back.

617
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:02,808
Well, I still say you don't
know what you're fuckin' with.

618
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:04,622
Look, do you wanna get hooked up or not?

619
00:34:04,622 --> 00:34:06,159
Well, what do you
want me to do about it?

620
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,304
I want you to conjure
up that fool, Killjoy.

621
00:34:08,304 --> 00:34:09,809
(suspenseful music)
(scoffs)

622
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:12,059
I'll take care of the rest.

623
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,708
The sun, the moon,
the air, and the light,

624
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,842
we beg you hear our cries tonight.

625
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:26,071
(wolf howls)

626
00:34:26,071 --> 00:34:28,300
The earth, the soil,
the flesh, and the dust,

627
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,133
we beg you, Killjoy, appear to us.

628
00:34:32,964 --> 00:34:34,283
Come on girl, keep goin'.

629
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:36,726
The sun, the moon,
the air, and the light,

630
00:34:36,726 --> 00:34:39,381
we beg you hear our cries tonight.

631
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:42,345
The earth, the soil,
the flesh, and the dust,

632
00:34:42,345 --> 00:34:45,178
we beg you, Killjoy, appear to us.

633
00:34:47,683 --> 00:34:50,433
(dramatic music)

634
00:34:52,344 --> 00:34:54,675
[Nick] Ce-Ce, you all right? Ce-Ce?

635
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,152
What the fuck's wrong with you?

636
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,985
Ce-Ce?

637
00:35:02,249 --> 00:35:03,145
Damn, are you all right?

638
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:04,116
I thought you were dead or something.

639
00:35:04,116 --> 00:35:06,366
[Ce-Ce] No, no, I'm fine.

640
00:35:11,117 --> 00:35:13,534
[Nick] So, uh, where is he?

641
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:16,916
I don't know.

642
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:21,789
You don't know? What do
you mean you don't know?

643
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:23,848
Shit, let me tell you then.

644
00:35:23,848 --> 00:35:27,160
Killjoy, your Granny
and her spooky stories,

645
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,624
that crazy witch back
there and her black magic,

646
00:35:29,624 --> 00:35:31,835
it's all bullshit!

647
00:35:31,835 --> 00:35:34,228
I knew it, man, I'm outta here.

648
00:35:34,228 --> 00:35:35,061
Wait!

649
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:39,300
What about our deal?

650
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,365
You said you could fix me up.

651
00:35:40,365 --> 00:35:42,093
You said you could deliver.

652
00:35:42,093 --> 00:35:44,658
(both sigh)

653
00:35:44,658 --> 00:35:48,158
Well, maybe we could work something out.

654
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,923
What do you say?

655
00:36:14,353 --> 00:36:16,975
They're still not back.

656
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:17,808
You know, I told them,

657
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:20,759
I warned them it was dangerous out there.

658
00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:24,155
You're all in danger,
more than you realize.

659
00:36:24,155 --> 00:36:25,439
What are you talking about?

660
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:28,514
I'm talking about the dark one, Killjoy.

661
00:36:28,514 --> 00:36:29,578
You talking about that story that.

662
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:31,907
Ce-Ce's grandmother told her?

663
00:36:31,907 --> 00:36:33,657
Yes, I'm afraid so.

664
00:36:34,975 --> 00:36:37,902
What's a fairy tale got to
do with our situation here?

665
00:36:37,902 --> 00:36:40,317
Killjoy's no fairy tale.

666
00:36:40,317 --> 00:36:43,586
He is real and he's coming for all of you.

667
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:46,247
(scoffs) How do you know that?

668
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:49,693
He's been summoned, I
can feel his presence.

669
00:36:49,693 --> 00:36:51,814
(breathes heavily)

670
00:36:51,814 --> 00:36:52,819
[Denise] Charlotte, what is it?

671
00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:56,986
It's Ray-Ray. Something's
wrong, please come, come on.

672
00:37:01,241 --> 00:37:04,497
(chuckles) You sure
came alive real fast.

673
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:08,165
Well, you offered the right incentive.

674
00:37:08,165 --> 00:37:10,332
- Yeah.
- So, what you got?

675
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:15,105
Look, about what I said earlier...

676
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:17,933
Yeah?

677
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:23,784
I don't know, it's just that...

678
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,147
I don't know, I was just...

679
00:37:25,147 --> 00:37:28,230
Wait! You do have something, right?

680
00:37:33,427 --> 00:37:35,094
You fucking bastard!

681
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,954
You just lied to me so I'd get with you.

682
00:37:38,954 --> 00:37:41,371
You fuckers are all the same.

683
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:44,807
Look, I lied to save Ray-Ray.

684
00:37:44,807 --> 00:37:46,798
Shit, you weren't
complaining a minute ago.

685
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:49,048
Whatever! You still lied.

686
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,260
(sighs)

687
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:08,429
(suspenseful music)

688
00:38:12,454 --> 00:38:13,787
Fucking bastard!

689
00:38:17,757 --> 00:38:20,090
(footsteps)

690
00:38:23,757 --> 00:38:27,924
Fuck him, fuck him!
(eerie circus music)

691
00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:33,299
(Killjoy laughs)

692
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:38,880
I'm back! (Laughs)

693
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,934
Who is that?

694
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:44,166
Whoo! Feels great! (Laughs)

695
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:44,999
Hello?

696
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:49,843
All right Nick, quit fuckin' around.

697
00:38:49,843 --> 00:38:51,926
(laughs)

698
00:38:56,491 --> 00:38:57,324
Nick?

699
00:39:02,351 --> 00:39:03,684
Nick! Oh my God!

700
00:39:05,917 --> 00:39:10,084
(Killjoy laughs and rattles shed)

701
00:39:13,256 --> 00:39:14,256
Who is that?

702
00:39:16,466 --> 00:39:17,299
Oh my God!

703
00:39:19,814 --> 00:39:23,399
I see you in there. (Laughs)

704
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:26,066
Hello. (Laughs)

705
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:36,938
(teeth chattering)

706
00:39:41,183 --> 00:39:43,850
(Ce-Ce screams)

707
00:39:47,276 --> 00:39:49,359
(laughs)

708
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:34,024
Ah!

709
00:40:35,882 --> 00:40:37,540
Ugh!

710
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,373
I hate sloppy seconds.

711
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,353
(laughs)

712
00:40:58,716 --> 00:41:01,466
(Killjoy laughs)

713
00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:12,139
(trees rustling)

714
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:40,324
(laughs)

715
00:41:41,778 --> 00:41:43,330
(door creaks open)

716
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,031
Where you guys been?

717
00:41:45,031 --> 00:41:47,103
Like I told you, I needed some space.

718
00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:49,013
Where's Ce-Ce?

719
00:41:49,013 --> 00:41:50,035
She's not here with you?

720
00:41:50,035 --> 00:41:52,039
No, I thought she was with you.

721
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:53,104
Look, I'm not her keeper.

722
00:41:53,104 --> 00:41:56,080
Well, you just left
her there outside alone?

723
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,599
Look, she's a big girl, all right?

724
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,960
She can take care of herself,

725
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,597
I'm not her fuckin' babysitter.

726
00:42:01,597 --> 00:42:03,249
Nick, wait.

727
00:42:03,249 --> 00:42:05,328
Look, I told you I
don't know where she is!

728
00:42:05,328 --> 00:42:07,661
It's not about that, Nick.

729
00:42:08,544 --> 00:42:09,627
It's Ray-Ray.

730
00:42:11,454 --> 00:42:14,871
(sighs) Look, I'm sorry.

731
00:42:16,385 --> 00:42:17,218
He's gone.

732
00:42:20,524 --> 00:42:22,120
(stutters) Where is he?

733
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,076
We took him outside to the barnyard.

734
00:42:24,076 --> 00:42:26,326
Kadja's there with him now.

735
00:42:27,272 --> 00:42:28,513
Why?

736
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:30,348
I don't know, she
was just goin' on about

737
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:31,639
we were in danger now.

738
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:33,429
I think we should all just stay here.

739
00:42:33,429 --> 00:42:36,359
I can't believe you're
listening to that Voodoo bullshit.

740
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:40,631
That bitch has that you
guys all conned, man.

741
00:42:40,631 --> 00:42:41,464
Nick.

742
00:42:43,324 --> 00:42:45,237
Where you going?

743
00:42:45,237 --> 00:42:48,404
I'm gonna say goodbye to my partner.

744
00:42:50,293 --> 00:42:52,293
(sighs)

745
00:42:54,494 --> 00:42:55,411
Goddamn it.

746
00:42:56,922 --> 00:42:59,034
Miss Martinez, when all of this is over,

747
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:03,827
are we still gonna have to go
back to the detention center?

748
00:43:03,827 --> 00:43:05,689
I don't know, okay?

749
00:43:05,689 --> 00:43:08,651
What's it matter? Anywhere
is better than here.

750
00:43:08,651 --> 00:43:10,068
Look, you guys,

751
00:43:11,285 --> 00:43:13,338
everything's gonna be okay, all right?

752
00:43:13,338 --> 00:43:15,572
Everybody's gonna come back.

753
00:43:15,572 --> 00:43:19,262
Soon as the sun comes up
I'm gonna go for help, okay?

754
00:43:19,262 --> 00:43:21,416
I still can't believe
anybody lives like this.

755
00:43:21,416 --> 00:43:24,158
No phone, no electricity,
no running water;

756
00:43:24,158 --> 00:43:27,408
it's crazy, it's worse than the ghetto.

757
00:43:27,408 --> 00:43:29,053
To each his own, okay?

758
00:43:29,053 --> 00:43:30,067
Speaking of which, I'm gonna go out to

759
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:32,105
that pump in the back and get some water.

760
00:43:32,105 --> 00:43:33,898
[Denise] Eddie, no!

761
00:43:33,898 --> 00:43:35,197
If she thought it was that dangerous,

762
00:43:35,197 --> 00:43:36,781
would she be out there?

763
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,454
Besides, it's just out back.

764
00:43:38,454 --> 00:43:41,662
She's not responsible
for you guys, I am!

765
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:45,181
And I think we should all just stay here.

766
00:43:45,181 --> 00:43:46,348
I'll hurry.

767
00:43:49,055 --> 00:43:52,388
(door opens and closes)

768
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:57,965
(sobs)
(suspenseful music

769
00:44:16,836 --> 00:44:18,049
(sighs) I feel like I'm on.

770
00:44:18,049 --> 00:44:21,216
"Little House on the Fuckin' Prairie."

771
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:25,383
(water pump squeaks)

772
00:44:25,383 --> 00:44:28,550
Oh no, they got LA tap water out here?

773
00:44:33,607 --> 00:44:36,690
There we go, Beverly Hills tap water.

774
00:44:37,853 --> 00:44:41,103
(Killjoy laughs)
Hello?

775
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:50,008
(suspenseful music)
Is somebody there?

776
00:44:58,663 --> 00:45:00,246
Ce-Ce. Is that you?

777
00:45:03,164 --> 00:45:06,967
Come on out, girl, Miss
Martinez is gettin' pissed.

778
00:45:06,967 --> 00:45:07,800
Ce-Ce?

779
00:45:09,543 --> 00:45:10,389
Are you in there?

780
00:45:10,389 --> 00:45:12,556
Come on, talk to me, girl.

781
00:45:14,014 --> 00:45:15,509
Ce-Ce?

782
00:45:15,509 --> 00:45:19,073
Oh God, blood! Oh God, oh! (Screams)

783
00:45:19,073 --> 00:45:21,823
(Killjoy laughs)

784
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,323
(water pump squeaks)

785
00:45:33,858 --> 00:45:37,387
(Killjoy laughs)
What the fuck?

786
00:45:37,387 --> 00:45:39,220
Ooh, enough of that.

787
00:45:40,091 --> 00:45:42,701
Put on a happy face, all your troubles

788
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:46,182
are almost over, for good. (Laughs)

789
00:45:46,182 --> 00:45:47,943
Stay the hell away from me, man.

790
00:45:47,943 --> 00:45:51,792
Ooh, I thought everybody loved a clown.

791
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,463
You come near me, I
swear I'll fuck you up!

792
00:45:53,463 --> 00:45:54,296
Ooh.

793
00:45:55,869 --> 00:45:58,243
Temper, temper my friend.

794
00:45:58,243 --> 00:46:02,410
Here, let me cool you off. (Laughs)

795
00:46:04,894 --> 00:46:08,811
Here it comes. (Oohs and aahs)

796
00:46:13,064 --> 00:46:15,147
(laughs)

797
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,748
You're fuckin' crazy, dude.

798
00:46:22,748 --> 00:46:27,726
(laughs) What? You didn't
think that was funny?

799
00:46:27,726 --> 00:46:28,559
No.

800
00:46:29,647 --> 00:46:33,814
Well, then how about this?
(Eddie grunts)

801
00:46:36,023 --> 00:46:38,106
(laughs)

802
00:46:40,128 --> 00:46:43,795
Now, that's funny. (Laughs)

803
00:46:49,422 --> 00:46:52,422
Whoo, ugh! (Laughs)

804
00:46:57,708 --> 00:47:00,791
(water pump squeaks)

805
00:47:15,127 --> 00:47:17,294
(gurgles)

806
00:47:23,179 --> 00:47:24,367
I'm glad you're back.

807
00:47:24,367 --> 00:47:26,932
Ce-Ce hasn't come back yet,
now I'm worried about Eddie.

808
00:47:26,932 --> 00:47:28,002
He left the house?

809
00:47:28,002 --> 00:47:30,006
Yeah. He went to go get some water,

810
00:47:30,006 --> 00:47:32,402
but, he still hasn't come back yet.

811
00:47:32,402 --> 00:47:33,735
I was about to go look for him.

812
00:47:33,735 --> 00:47:35,476
No, you mustn't.

813
00:47:35,476 --> 00:47:38,126
Why not? I mean I just
can't leave them out there.

814
00:47:38,126 --> 00:47:39,598
[Kadja] You won't be safe.

815
00:47:39,598 --> 00:47:41,621
But, what about the others?

816
00:47:41,621 --> 00:47:43,555
It's too late.

817
00:47:43,555 --> 00:47:44,791
Now what are you sayin'?

818
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:48,008
I tried to warn you,
but you wouldn't listen.

819
00:47:48,008 --> 00:47:49,778
Your friends are gone and you will be too

820
00:47:49,778 --> 00:47:52,221
if you leave here, he's waiting out there.

821
00:47:52,221 --> 00:47:53,554
- Who?
- Killjoy!

822
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,968
Killjoy?

823
00:47:57,175 --> 00:48:01,789
(scoffs) I mean even if I
believed in this shit, why?

824
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:03,828
Why is he coming?

825
00:48:03,828 --> 00:48:05,797
Tell them about it, Nick.

826
00:48:05,797 --> 00:48:09,797
They need to know.
(clock ticks)

827
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,346
What is she talking about, Nick?

828
00:48:15,273 --> 00:48:16,106
Nick?

829
00:48:17,297 --> 00:48:18,866
What?

830
00:48:18,866 --> 00:48:20,845
I was just trying to help Ray-Ray out.

831
00:48:20,845 --> 00:48:22,616
Damn you, Nick!

832
00:48:22,616 --> 00:48:25,453
Look, Ce-Ce and I
went out into the woods,

833
00:48:25,453 --> 00:48:28,484
she did some kind of
ceremony thing, I don't know.

834
00:48:28,484 --> 00:48:29,858
Is that true?

835
00:48:29,858 --> 00:48:32,759
Yeah, but it didn't
work, it was all bullshit.

836
00:48:32,759 --> 00:48:34,410
Yeah, well where is Ce-Ce?

837
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,546
Look, I told you I don't know!

838
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:37,461
All right, we got into an argument

839
00:48:37,461 --> 00:48:39,578
in the woods and she ran off.

840
00:48:39,578 --> 00:48:40,906
It's the last I saw of her.

841
00:48:40,906 --> 00:48:42,562
Why didn't you say something?

842
00:48:42,562 --> 00:48:43,479
Say what?

843
00:48:45,224 --> 00:48:49,126
You don't actually believe
Killjoy exists, much do you?

844
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,062
I don't know, okay?

845
00:48:51,062 --> 00:48:53,067
All I know is that I
don't know where Ce-Ce is,

846
00:48:53,067 --> 00:48:54,967
and I don't know where Eddie is.

847
00:48:54,967 --> 00:48:57,300
I don't know where they are.

848
00:48:58,459 --> 00:49:00,042
Jesus Christ, Nick.

849
00:49:01,337 --> 00:49:03,823
What, are you trying to get us all killed?

850
00:49:03,823 --> 00:49:06,624
I don't believe in this
Voodoo bullshit anyway.

851
00:49:06,624 --> 00:49:09,207
You know what, man? Fuck y'all.

852
00:49:10,539 --> 00:49:13,289
Wait! We're not gonna split up.

853
00:49:15,044 --> 00:49:18,472
Yeah, Nick, come on,
we need to stay together.

854
00:49:18,472 --> 00:49:22,639
I'm outta here.
(door opens and closes)

855
00:49:25,157 --> 00:49:25,990
Great.

856
00:49:27,467 --> 00:49:30,864
So, what are we gonna do now? Pray?

857
00:49:30,864 --> 00:49:33,235
That sure sounds like a good idea to me.

858
00:49:33,235 --> 00:49:37,402
(chuckles) Somethin' like that.

859
00:49:42,893 --> 00:49:47,060
(insects chirping)
(suspenseful music)

860
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:54,100
(Killjoy laughs)

861
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,850
Ce-Ce, is that you?

862
00:49:57,364 --> 00:50:02,255
Look, I'm sorry about what
happened earlier, all right?

863
00:50:02,255 --> 00:50:04,754
(Killjoy laughs)

864
00:50:04,754 --> 00:50:06,973
Is that you, Eddie?

865
00:50:06,973 --> 00:50:09,102
Man, ain't no time for your bullshit.

866
00:50:09,102 --> 00:50:12,021
Shit ain't funny, man,
quit clownin' around.

867
00:50:12,021 --> 00:50:16,188
(laughs) I think it's
real funny, brother.

868
00:50:18,135 --> 00:50:20,218
(laughs)

869
00:50:25,862 --> 00:50:27,878
What the fuck are you supposed to be?

870
00:50:27,878 --> 00:50:32,045
Me? I'm the one you and
your girlfriend asked for.

871
00:50:32,995 --> 00:50:36,215
She was sweet, by the way. (Laughs)

872
00:50:36,215 --> 00:50:37,408
Man, where is she?

873
00:50:37,408 --> 00:50:41,241
Who, her? I tore off
a piece of that myself.

874
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,061
Several (slurps) pieces. (Laughs)

875
00:50:47,061 --> 00:50:49,061
And now, it's your turn.

876
00:50:51,412 --> 00:50:53,357
Turn for what, man?

877
00:50:53,357 --> 00:50:56,274
(laughs) To die.

878
00:50:58,201 --> 00:51:02,368
Shit, I don't think so,
my circus freak brother.

879
00:51:03,296 --> 00:51:06,647
Oh, don't shoot. No, no, no, no, no, no.

880
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:10,814
(gunfire)
(Killjoy groans)

881
00:51:12,681 --> 00:51:15,264
(laughs, tsks)

882
00:51:16,526 --> 00:51:18,236
What the fuck?

883
00:51:18,236 --> 00:51:20,319
(laughs)

884
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:29,745
Missed me, missed me, now
you've gotta kiss me. (Kiss)

885
00:51:29,745 --> 00:51:32,132
Fuck it. Guns are for
pussies anyway, man.

886
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:34,303
I'm gonna cut that fuckin'
smile off your face.

887
00:51:34,303 --> 00:51:36,036
Aw, don't you know a smile is just

888
00:51:36,036 --> 00:51:38,703
a frown turned upside down, huh?

889
00:51:40,041 --> 00:51:42,374
I told you it's time to die.

890
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:47,613
Here.

891
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:49,898
Oh?

892
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:56,344
(laughs)

893
00:51:58,317 --> 00:51:59,150
[Nick] What the hell are you doin',

894
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,233
you fuckin' Bozo wannabe?

895
00:52:06,462 --> 00:52:07,295
(grunts)

896
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,378
I'm not doing anything.

897
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:14,607
Your life appears to be
in your hands. (Laughs)

898
00:52:16,046 --> 00:52:18,434
Ah!
(Nick grunts)

899
00:52:18,434 --> 00:52:20,846
Oh, that's gotta hurt.

900
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:25,317
Ooh, ooh, let's give you a
smiley face, come on, come on!

901
00:52:25,317 --> 00:52:27,300
(both shouting)

902
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,686
Ooh, does that hurt? Does it, does it?

903
00:52:29,686 --> 00:52:30,853
Perhaps again.

904
00:52:32,669 --> 00:52:34,738
Ah!
(Nick grunts)

905
00:52:34,738 --> 00:52:37,215
Ooh, are you bleeding, are you bleeding?

906
00:52:37,215 --> 00:52:39,895
Yes you are, good. (Laughs)

907
00:52:39,895 --> 00:52:42,069
How 'bout one more?

908
00:52:42,069 --> 00:52:44,362
Oh, you still have an eye left.

909
00:52:44,362 --> 00:52:48,056
Let me see what I can
do about that. (Grunts)

910
00:52:48,056 --> 00:52:50,556
(Nick grunts)

911
00:52:51,463 --> 00:52:53,546
(laughs)

912
00:52:54,706 --> 00:52:57,039
Oh, come on now baby, smile.

913
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:04,206
People need to get more
fun out of death. (Laughs)

914
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,499
Lost in darkness, in secrets concealed,

915
00:53:23,499 --> 00:53:26,999
we plead with thee, let truth be revealed.

916
00:53:29,687 --> 00:53:32,937
Lost in darkness, in secrets concealed,

917
00:53:34,054 --> 00:53:37,554
we plead with thee, let truth be revealed.

918
00:53:38,806 --> 00:53:42,056
Lost in darkness, in secrets concealed,

919
00:53:44,184 --> 00:53:47,693
we plead with thee, let truth be revealed.

920
00:53:47,693 --> 00:53:48,881
(suspenseful music)

921
00:53:48,881 --> 00:53:50,367
Lost in darkness...

922
00:53:50,367 --> 00:53:52,521
Are you sure this thing is working?

923
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:55,738
(chuckles) Oh, it's working all right.

924
00:53:55,738 --> 00:53:57,988
I can feel him, he is near.

925
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:03,472
Are you ready>

926
00:54:06,822 --> 00:54:08,489
Yeah, we're ready.

927
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:21,607
Now you come.

928
00:54:34,969 --> 00:54:38,856
Charlotte, come on,
we have to trust Kadja,

929
00:54:38,856 --> 00:54:42,023
she knows what she's doing. It's okay.

930
00:54:50,837 --> 00:54:52,837
(gasps)

931
00:55:11,446 --> 00:55:14,196
(Killjoy laughs)

932
00:55:17,635 --> 00:55:18,555
What was that?

933
00:55:18,555 --> 00:55:22,508
(chuckles) it's him, it's Killjoy.

934
00:55:22,508 --> 00:55:24,456
What does he want from us?

935
00:55:24,456 --> 00:55:28,383
He wants all of us, and
his power is very strong.

936
00:55:28,383 --> 00:55:32,338
(Killjoy laughs)
(skull buzzes)

937
00:55:32,338 --> 00:55:36,505
[Killjoy] Come out, come
out, wherever you are. (Laughs)

938
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:41,527
Shut up, shut up, you shut up!

939
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:46,850
(chuckles) That's nothing.

940
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:48,237
Mere tricks.

941
00:55:48,237 --> 00:55:50,289
Oh, Killjoy's quite a prankster.

942
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:54,078
He likes to taunt and tease
before moving in for the kill.

943
00:55:54,078 --> 00:55:57,610
(chuckles) But, we'll see
who'll have the last laugh.

944
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:59,606
[Denise] What do we do?

945
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,106
I must face him.

946
00:56:02,232 --> 00:56:05,815
You stay here in the
house, you'll be safe.

947
00:56:08,078 --> 00:56:11,218
Listen, I can't let you
go out there all alone.

948
00:56:11,218 --> 00:56:12,885
[Kadja] Very well.

949
00:56:15,308 --> 00:56:19,124
Listen, Charlotte, you
just stay in the house, okay?

950
00:56:19,124 --> 00:56:21,123
Kadja said it's safe here.

951
00:56:21,123 --> 00:56:23,809
You just find yourself a place to hide.

952
00:56:23,809 --> 00:56:26,809
No. Miss Martinez, what about you?

953
00:56:28,467 --> 00:56:30,055
I'm scared.

954
00:56:30,055 --> 00:56:32,647
I know, I'm scared too.

955
00:56:32,647 --> 00:56:35,407
But, you just stay here, you'll be safe.

956
00:56:35,407 --> 00:56:36,574
We'll be back.

957
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:40,203
Here, for your protection.

958
00:56:44,774 --> 00:56:47,774
(suspenseful music)

959
00:57:01,735 --> 00:57:04,652
(breathes heavily)

960
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:14,012
(wind blows)

961
00:57:26,116 --> 00:57:27,830
(Killjoy laughs)

962
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:29,033
He is near.

963
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:30,756
You better find a place to hide yourself,

964
00:57:30,756 --> 00:57:32,989
you shouldn't let him see you!

965
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:35,717
I'll deal with this thing from here.

966
00:57:35,717 --> 00:57:37,717
- But...
- Go, hide now!

967
00:57:41,448 --> 00:57:43,531
(sniffs)

968
00:57:45,326 --> 00:57:47,997
[Killjoy] Here, piggy,
piggy, piggy, piggy, piggy.

969
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:51,691
Here, piggy. I know
you're out here somewhere.

970
00:57:51,691 --> 00:57:54,608
Hello? Where are you, little piggy?

971
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:01,437
Come out, come out,
wherever you are. (Laughs)

972
00:58:02,573 --> 00:58:04,671
Come out!
(Denise gasps)

973
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:07,588
Come on, piggy, don't be a chicken.

974
00:58:08,675 --> 00:58:12,842
(clucks) Come out. (Clucks)

975
00:58:14,148 --> 00:58:18,315
Come out little chicken. (Clucks)

976
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:31,790
All right, time's up, copper!

977
00:58:34,732 --> 00:58:35,899
Where are you?

978
00:58:38,197 --> 00:58:41,030
(breathes deeply)

979
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:46,503
Lord of the spirits, to you I do call.

980
00:58:49,361 --> 00:58:53,901
Lord of the night, of the
moon, of the stars, hear me!

981
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:56,754
I was going to save
you for last. (Laughs)

982
00:58:56,754 --> 00:59:01,109
This is going far enough,
I won't let you hurt them!

983
00:59:01,109 --> 00:59:04,742
Well, you know, I've got things to do,

984
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:08,159
people to kill. (Laughs)

985
00:59:13,885 --> 00:59:16,512
(suspenseful music)

986
00:59:16,512 --> 00:59:18,512
(gasps)

987
00:59:20,067 --> 00:59:22,418
[Charlotte] It's me! Miss
Martinez, it's me, it's me.

988
00:59:22,418 --> 00:59:26,585
Calma, we gotta get out of
here before he comes back.

989
00:59:28,377 --> 00:59:29,210
Where did you go?

990
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:30,270
Is not important.

991
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,136
Come on, you've gotta
get back in the house.

992
00:59:32,136 --> 00:59:34,835
I know. We gotta get outta
here, come on, let's go.

993
00:59:34,835 --> 00:59:35,752
Let's go.

994
00:59:40,545 --> 00:59:44,253
Get back, you devil,
I'm not afraid of you.

995
00:59:44,253 --> 00:59:48,420
Come on, baby, is that the
best you've got? (Laughs)

996
00:59:52,197 --> 00:59:54,447
(rumbling)

997
00:59:55,408 --> 00:59:56,991
Ooh, what was that?

998
00:59:59,458 --> 01:00:02,708
You're on your way to
hell where you belong!

999
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:03,625
Ooh, hmm.

1000
01:00:05,337 --> 01:00:07,087
Well, let's see here.

1001
01:00:08,149 --> 01:00:09,982
What shall I wish for?

1002
01:00:22,045 --> 01:00:25,697
Why don't you quit while you're ahead?

1003
01:00:25,697 --> 01:00:29,864
No! (Screams)
(Killjoy laughs)

1004
01:00:34,388 --> 01:00:37,471
(strangles, shrieks)

1005
01:00:43,828 --> 01:00:44,882
What are we gonna do?

1006
01:00:44,882 --> 01:00:46,215
Lock the door.

1007
01:00:52,632 --> 01:00:57,025
(laughs) Killjoy's in the house.

1008
01:00:57,025 --> 01:00:58,927
Miss Martinez, maybe
everyone is not dead.

1009
01:00:58,927 --> 01:01:00,732
Someone could be out there
finding us help right now.

1010
01:01:00,732 --> 01:01:03,407
(laughs)

1011
01:01:03,407 --> 01:01:06,990
Honeys, I'm home. (Laughs)

1012
01:01:09,603 --> 01:01:11,270
What a great spread.

1013
01:01:12,917 --> 01:01:14,667
Let me guess, some...

1014
01:01:15,986 --> 01:01:20,153
Bed, Bath and Beyond the Grave. (Laughs)

1015
01:01:21,423 --> 01:01:23,506
Come on, you sick fuck!

1016
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:27,850
Whoo, oh!

1017
01:01:29,133 --> 01:01:31,725
So, you like to play rough, huh?

1018
01:01:31,725 --> 01:01:35,892
Good. I like spunky girls. (Laughs)

1019
01:01:37,531 --> 01:01:39,519
I'm not goin' down that easy.

1020
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:41,019
Oh, yes you are.

1021
01:01:43,987 --> 01:01:46,070
(laughs)

1022
01:01:47,727 --> 01:01:49,256
What's that you say?

1023
01:01:49,256 --> 01:01:53,423
Can't we all just get along? (Laughs)

1024
01:01:55,604 --> 01:01:57,995
Leave me alone, you psycho circus.

1025
01:01:57,995 --> 01:02:02,162
(laughs) You. You have been
a very, very naughty girl,

1026
01:02:04,949 --> 01:02:06,799
haven't you, Charlotte?

1027
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:10,966
And we all know what happens
to naughty girls, don't we?

1028
01:02:15,004 --> 01:02:19,142
Lord of the black
spirit, to you I do call.

1029
01:02:19,142 --> 01:02:20,642
Lord of the night.

1030
01:02:21,967 --> 01:02:24,588
Yes, smartass, go ahead, go on.

1031
01:02:24,588 --> 01:02:28,783
Lord of the night, of
the moon, of the stars,

1032
01:02:28,783 --> 01:02:29,616
hear me,

1033
01:02:30,691 --> 01:02:31,524
hear me.

1034
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:34,655
Lord of the night...

1035
01:02:34,655 --> 01:02:38,232
Yes, son of night, moon of dark, yeah.

1036
01:02:38,232 --> 01:02:40,341
I guess the only question is

1037
01:02:40,341 --> 01:02:42,646
how long is this going to take, huh?

1038
01:02:42,646 --> 01:02:44,640
As long as it has to.

1039
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:49,251
Oh, that could be a very,
very long time, my child.

1040
01:02:49,251 --> 01:02:52,168
You see, I have all of an eternity.

1041
01:02:53,846 --> 01:02:55,835
How 'bout you?

1042
01:02:55,835 --> 01:02:56,752
Fuck you.

1043
01:02:58,975 --> 01:02:59,808
Boring!

1044
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:01,863
Boring!

1045
01:03:03,148 --> 01:03:04,570
Boring!

1046
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:06,183
Has anyone ever told you what

1047
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:09,516
an insufferable bore you are, Charlotte?

1048
01:03:10,866 --> 01:03:13,913
(grunts) I tell you what.

1049
01:03:13,913 --> 01:03:16,915
What about you put down the book,

1050
01:03:16,915 --> 01:03:20,056
and I'll give you a 10-second head start.

1051
01:03:20,056 --> 01:03:21,806
What do you say, huh?

1052
01:03:23,312 --> 01:03:26,645
No?
(Charlotte screams)

1053
01:03:28,357 --> 01:03:31,584
Just when our game was
getting so exciting.

1054
01:03:31,584 --> 01:03:34,036
Why can't you enjoy yourself, huh?

1055
01:03:34,036 --> 01:03:35,994
Leave me alone. (Whimpers)

1056
01:03:35,994 --> 01:03:37,623
Why are you doing this to me?

1057
01:03:37,623 --> 01:03:40,090
(laughs)

1058
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:41,990
Mr. Redding? (Whimpers)

1059
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:46,961
(laughs) I am the king
of the pranksters, child,

1060
01:03:46,961 --> 01:03:48,698
that's the oldest trick in the book.

1061
01:03:48,698 --> 01:03:51,011
I won't fall for that.

1062
01:03:51,011 --> 01:03:52,937
(cocks weapon)
(dramatic music)

1063
01:03:52,937 --> 01:03:53,770
What?

1064
01:03:55,936 --> 01:03:56,769
You sir,

1065
01:03:58,482 --> 01:04:00,649
are not on the guest list!

1066
01:04:01,634 --> 01:04:03,508
Daddy's runnin' a little late,

1067
01:04:03,508 --> 01:04:05,755
but, this party's 'bout to get started.

1068
01:04:05,755 --> 01:04:09,922
Oh finally, someone worth
dropping everything for.

1069
01:04:11,634 --> 01:04:14,467
(gasps, whimpers)

1070
01:04:15,869 --> 01:04:20,036
Ooh, it's a big gun, I'm scared. (Growls)

1071
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:25,114
(laughs)
What the hell?

1072
01:04:25,114 --> 01:04:27,874
(laughs) Don't you know
it's rude to crash a party?

1073
01:04:27,874 --> 01:04:29,207
You know what?

1074
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:33,780
I hate the great outdoors.

1075
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:38,000
And I really fuckin'
hate clowns. Let's go.

1076
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,365
Come on, then, come on.

1077
01:04:40,365 --> 01:04:42,676
Ha! (Laughs)

1078
01:04:42,676 --> 01:04:46,263
You're forcing me to be
rude to my other guests.

1079
01:04:46,263 --> 01:04:48,013
They're right over...

1080
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:52,119
Well, they were here just a moment ago.

1081
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:53,392
Take that, you sick bastard.

1082
01:04:53,392 --> 01:04:55,211
(Killjoy shouts, flesh sizzles)

1083
01:04:55,211 --> 01:04:57,391
You killed my friends, you bastard!

1084
01:04:57,391 --> 01:05:00,163
(screams, flesh sizzles)

1085
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:02,246
(shouts)

1086
01:05:15,419 --> 01:05:17,587
This party's over, brother.

1087
01:05:17,587 --> 01:05:19,504
(gags)

1088
01:05:23,133 --> 01:05:25,649
Mr. Redding, we thought you were dead.

1089
01:05:25,649 --> 01:05:26,566
Oh, my God.

1090
01:05:29,042 --> 01:05:32,792
Looks like I didn't
make it in time, did I?

1091
01:05:40,889 --> 01:05:45,056
(birds chirping)
(indistinct police radio)

1092
01:05:50,598 --> 01:05:53,681
[Denise] Charlotte, wake up, honey.

1093
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:58,730
Miss Martinez, you're alive.

1094
01:06:01,169 --> 01:06:03,919
Oh, I have something to tell you.

1095
01:06:06,553 --> 01:06:08,970
Where is he?
Shh, he's gone.

1096
01:06:11,876 --> 01:06:13,712
We can go get some help now.

1097
01:06:13,712 --> 01:06:16,239
Miss Martinez, you don't even know...

1098
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:18,572
(both gasp)

1099
01:06:21,657 --> 01:06:24,482
Harris, I thought you were dead.

1100
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:26,565
I told you I'd be back.

1101
01:06:27,895 --> 01:06:29,812
Couldn't leave my girl.

1102
01:06:32,637 --> 01:06:35,231
(cell phone rings)

1103
01:06:35,231 --> 01:06:37,347
Let's get outta here.

1104
01:06:37,347 --> 01:06:39,930
Ma'am, you have a phone call.

1105
01:06:42,681 --> 01:06:43,514
Hello?

1106
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:45,542
Mom!

1107
01:06:49,049 --> 01:06:50,466
No, I'm okay now.

1108
01:06:52,247 --> 01:06:55,498
It is so good to hear your voice.

1109
01:06:55,498 --> 01:06:57,915
I'm on my way home now, yeah.

1110
01:07:03,622 --> 01:07:07,789
(dramatic music)
(indistinct police radio)

1111
01:07:50,515 --> 01:07:53,579
(hip-hop music)

1112
01:07:53,579 --> 01:07:57,746
♫ Yeah, yeah, Killjoy, Killjoy two,

1113
01:07:58,981 --> 01:08:01,148
♫ Comin' back at ya

1114
01:08:01,148 --> 01:08:05,315
♫ (laughs) Watch out
for those clowns, y'all,

1115
01:08:09,959 --> 01:08:12,729
♫ Killjoy

1116
01:08:12,729 --> 01:08:16,896
♫ All of our lives, we
had to push and fight

1117
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:22,687
♫ Doin' our time and payin' our price

1118
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:28,308
♫ We made some wrong choices,
we made some wrong turns

1119
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:33,906
♫ But, we can't look back
now, why didn't we learn

1120
01:08:36,436 --> 01:08:40,603
♫ Why oh, why did it go down like this

1121
01:08:42,112 --> 01:08:46,279
♫ We were doin' our time
when we started this trip

1122
01:08:48,434 --> 01:08:52,601
♫ And I was taught clowns
supposed to bring us smiles

1123
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:58,298
♫ I never was taught
one could take our lives

1124
01:09:00,442 --> 01:09:04,609
♫ Don't ever play with
that old black magic

1125
01:09:06,071 --> 01:09:10,238
♫ 'Cause suddenly your life
could end in one big tragic

1126
01:09:12,109 --> 01:09:16,276
♫ As soon as love bloomed
and we all became friends

1127
01:09:17,771 --> 01:09:21,938
♫ That sick circus clown
would snatch it all to an end

1128
01:09:24,561 --> 01:09:28,728
♫ Why, oh why, did it go down like this

1129
01:09:29,721 --> 01:09:33,888
♫ We were doin' our time
when we started this trip

1130
01:09:36,116 --> 01:09:40,283
♫ And I was taught clowns
supposed to bring us smiles

1131
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:46,267
♫ I never was taught
one could take our lives

1132
01:09:48,401 --> 01:09:51,136
♫ We were trying to learn
how to better our lives

1133
01:09:51,136 --> 01:09:54,142
♫ Was the beginning to the
end to all of our surprise

1134
01:09:54,142 --> 01:09:57,316
♫ We had an addict, nothin',
why, two gang-bangin' thugs

1135
01:09:57,316 --> 01:10:00,190
♫ And let's not forget
our little Miss Firebug

1136
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:02,945
♫ Miss Martinez, Mr.
Redding, yeah, they rode too

1137
01:10:02,945 --> 01:10:06,045
♫ And that was some of the
whole second Killjoy crew

1138
01:10:06,045 --> 01:10:09,095
♫ So, we loaded the bus
and rode on our merry way

1139
01:10:09,095 --> 01:10:12,474
♫ For that 200 miles, that 90-day stay

1140
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:16,641
♫ Why, oh why, did it go down like this

1141
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:21,780
♫ We were doin' our time
when we started this trip

1142
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:28,247
♫ And I was taught clowns
supposed to bring us smiles

1143
01:10:30,331 --> 01:10:34,498
♫ I never was taught
one could take our lives

1144
01:10:36,474 --> 01:10:40,641
♫ Why, oh why, did it go down like this

1145
01:10:41,667 --> 01:10:45,834
♫ We were doin' our time
when we started this trip

1146
01:10:48,066 --> 01:10:52,233
♫ And I was taught clowns
supposed to bring us smiles

1147
01:10:54,088 --> 01:10:58,255
♫ I never was taught
one would take our lives

1148
01:11:05,379 --> 01:11:07,546
♫ Killjoy

1149
01:11:11,348 --> 01:11:13,515
♫ Killjoy

1150
01:11:17,357 --> 01:11:21,107
♫ Killjoy ♫

1151
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:26,363
